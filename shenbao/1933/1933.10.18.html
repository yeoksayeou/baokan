<p>時評</p>
<h3>從德國退出國聯說到日本政局　旡</h3>
<p>前日德國政府毅然宣布脫離國際聯盟與軍縮會議後。歐洲政局。大受震動。遠東關係。尤感緊張。此和平假面具之掀揭。即市塲爭奪戰之開始。盰衡全局。深堪悲歎。溯厥由來。豈偶然哉。</p>
<p>德國自歐戰而還割地賠金。瘡夷獨巨然經十餘年來之猛力經營。旣覷破歐陸諸强之矛盾。後利用欲取先予以原則相機應付國勢乃得日漸向上。國際地位。日益增高。經濟能力。亦日以蘇甦。在當時戰勝諸强之所以必須重建德國資本主義而孕育之者。不過藉以樹立反俄之屏蔽。且爲榨取賠欵之工具。而初不料其遂浸浸不可復制。况德國經濟復興之日。正世界生產過剩之時。三四年來。各國咸正一致注意於解决恐慌之道。德國在此時期。先於一九三一年展付賠欵。繼於今年七月又展付一切商業負債。得稍蘇息。而其統治者目睹列强經濟國家主義發達之情勢。自唯有亟謀自救之一法。而自救必軍事與經濟兼施。國防與治安並進。迎頭追趕。遂有今日與列强相抗衡之形勢。</p>
<p>今英法諸國。表面固在於阻止德國之重整軍備。而德國之所以堅决要求。亦惟藉辭於自衛。然以吾觀察。恐此問題所造成之影響。關係殊不止此。</p>
<p>由歐洲方面言。德國現當局登台之日。即曾聲言將撕燬凡爾賽條約。收復殖民地。爭取波蘭走廊。要求軍備平等。其所希望甚奢。然迄今無一實現。日内瓦方面。且有堅决拒絶之表示。遂不惜退出國聯以激怒其民心。再法德之爭。爲歐洲歷史上不可麽滅之事實。而其核心在於重割歐洲上版圖。意見愈難接近。今德旣退出國聯矣。可以自由擴張軍備矣。行見和平基礎之完全破裂。惟待戰神之降臨而已。</p>
<p>由遠東方面言之。德國爲繼日本退出國聯之一員。日一軍人派當然深喜吾道之不孤。而益感擴張軍備之不容已。當德國退出消息傳達東京之際。荒木貞夫稱「一切惟事機是視」海軍當局則稱「一九三五年之軍縮會議更無結果。」由是五相會議中之海陸軍。當益振振有辭。而遠東軍事恐慌。當益加速化。自可不言而喻。夫日本五相會議。號稱爲國防外交一致之審議。但其軍財兩閥之衝突。則爲不可掩之事實。今若此。財閥將不免於犧牲。而軍閥之悍然揭開面具。内以加强鎭壓。外以急事侵略。亦爲可以預想之事。彼德國之退出聯盟。不過爲東京政局恐慌之先兆焉耳。</p>

<h3>各國對德沉機觀變　歐局正多隱憂　匈牙利有步德後塵勢　奥國家社會黨大示威　羅馬進行英法德大使會議</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮總委員會業已答復德國退會通知、而德國亦復間接作答、宣稱眞正軍縮工作仍可進行、但奥匈兩國之新發展、業已推翻早日諒解之希望、照目前情勢、各大國與德國顯將俱無急切行動、惟匈牙利將要求修改特里阿農條約之訊、與奥地利之發生嚴重紛擾、俱使今日一時間發生之樂觀化歸烏有之鄕、</p>
<p>軍縮總委員會通過主席漢德森所擬致德復文後、即行休會至十月二十六日、俾予各國政治家私人談話機會、主席漢德林宣稱、商致軍縮恊定之工作、决不容受他事之干涉、他國不當祇因德國之退出即停止其工作、當委員會散會時、漢氏又稱、渠希望各代表將得返此間、凖備簽定一軍備恊定、</p>
<p>軍縮委員會甫休會、羅馬方面、即由德·英·法·大使開始私人談話、意相墨索里尼未曾參加聞各大使之談話、希望開誠交換意見後、或可引入解决危局途徑、</p>
<p>當軍縮總委員會表决致德復文時、土·俄·匈·波蘭·四國代表放棄表决權、並聲明若輩非反對所送牒文乃係抗議事前之商榷未曾諮商彼等而起、國聯中人現信國際　旣有此裂痕、匈牙利凖備利用機會、壓迫國聯、修改特里阿農條約、若干代表並以爲匈國設有此種要求、或將使各小國分裂爲兩派</p>
<p>軍縮總委員會旣經休會、國聯各代表刻正研究奥國時局、按各大國之不願即允德人重行武裝、一部份原因亦由於對奥欲保持完全自由行動故也、頃據維也納消息、奥之國家社會黨重作示威行動學生首起滋閙、致政府已下令停閉全國大學云（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>美政府表示　不與聞歐政治　合作祗以軍縮爲限</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）美代表台維斯奉本國政府訓令、發表宣言曰、吾人之抵日内瓦、專爲辦理軍縮問題、在此問題有繼續進行談判、而可望成功之日、吾人殊樂與各國合作、第吾人殊不願與聞純粹政治事件、或純關歐洲前途之各點、吾人今願再行聲明者、美國與歐洲任何大國、毫無政治上之結合、吾人心目中所存之任何條約、純關於世界軍縮問題、至於目前努力之賡續有益與否、此爲歐洲應答之問題、美國未便代答、本星期内歐洲各都間將進行談話、此種談話含有政治性質、吾人不願於此有活動之合作、羅斯福總統今年五月間致各國元首之文所舉之原則、仍爲美國政策之所基云云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>準備繼續討論軍縮　德國照會意政府</h3>
<p>羅馬　聞德國爲表明其和平志願計、已照會意政府、聲明凖備在日内瓦會議外繼續軍縮之討論、其意顯不欲作新談判、但願沿兩國所已行之途徑而進行、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府决定聽令歐洲列强自决完成軍縮之努力應否依一般的規模繼續進行、本星期内歐陸任何會議美國槪不參加、現悉美政府切望目前事變所發生之談判、勿牽及政治糾紛、華盛頓人士現</p>
<p>覺往日各國志同道合、集爲一體者、乃完全注重世界軍縮事件、美政府不應在政治上與歐洲任何國相連合云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日官方聲稱、美國對於軍縮會議仍取靜觀政策、以待數日後之發展、但美國已準備恊助整個、軍縮計畫之進行、現無新訓令致軍縮會美代表台維斯云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼　待機出面斡旋</h3>
<p>已與各國大吏交換意見</p>
<p>羅馬意政府現仍努力覓取繼續軍縮談判之新基礎、已與各國大使交換意見、惟因性質錯综、故官塲尚未有消息宣露、衆信意相墨索里尼須俟國外輿論漸趨鎭靜、而體恤德國之行動時、然後出塲斡旋、意國各報亦皆作提倡轉　之言論、意大利日報有言曰、吾深信退路之希望未全斷、一切門户未全閉塞云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬兹據今日與昨日在外部與各國代表談話之結果、意首相墨索里尼恐不日即將發出請柬、邀請四强公約簽字國之外交長官、在此舉行聯席會議云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>麥唐納　研究應付方針　正與歐洲各國密切磋商</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英皇秘書今日在唐寗街十號相邸與首相麥唐納討論歐洲政局半小時、英首相在邸中隨時接得日内瓦西門外相及全歐各英使署之報告、樞密院長包爾温亦與首相互相磋商、至於閣議似仍將俟本星期三日召　、屆時西門外相可由日内瓦遄返英倫參加也、今日政界各方面均力主鎭靜、同時若干人認爲德總理希特勒之演說中仍有重開談判之意、雖是說業經柏林方面否認　但稱希特勒之演說、雖便談判之途徑仍未閉塞、惟德國不能爲主動云、現時擁護法總揆達拉第之國會議員、均主軍縮會應繼續進行、並草擬公約　由各國簽字、將來俟德國簽字後、再行發生效力云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國閣員批評德國退出軍縮會議者、以財相張伯倫爲第一人、張氏今日在諾汀漢演說、謂德國行動魯莽妄斷、至可扼腕云、張氏切言、外相西門經法美意三國贊同而提出之建議、志在使德國於相當期内享受完全平等之待遇、又謂今日之大局、須需甚鎭靜與謹愼之考量以對付之、未可遽作驚人的推測宜俟英國與他國彼此磋商此不幸事件所含之關係及决定今日應取之方針、而後始可下斷云云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）各國代表團之重要份子、如英外相西門·法外長彭古等、均將爲軍縮會延會期内遄返本國、與政府接洽一切、西門外相或可出席星期三日之閣議、屆時將討論軍縮會最近之發展、西門外相俟到達倫敦後、即往晤首相麥唐納、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳駐英德大使赴英外部詳述德國退出國聯及軍縮會理由之說、兹已證明不確、蓋今日有一面貌極似德大使者曾赴外部、附近之攝影記者誤爲德大使、乃爭相攝影、而外部之閽者雖識德大使之面貌、亦幾誤認之云、（十六路透電）</p>
<h3>法政府不贊成　援用四强公約　輿論對德鎭靜莊重</h3>
<p>（巴黎）軍縮會議延會而不閉會、此乃依照法政府主張之政策、而切實拒絶與　作片面之談話、巴黎人士對此甚爲滿意、法政府不贊成利用四國公約、謂該約</p>
<p>僅可在國聯構體内動作云、一般人士以爲德國旣脫離國聯、則已自處於該約範圍之外、衆視希特勒之目的、乃在打破英法之團結、而使法國入於睡態、輿論對於德國之引離日内瓦、殊形鎭靜莊重、惟交易所今日内外各證劵跌風甚厲、法内閣定明晨集議國會亦定午後重行開會、總理達拉第將蒞會陳述法國對德政策、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長彭古今晨抵此、即出席閣議、閣議於十時後開會、總統親自主席、聆彭古報告日内瓦之現局、並通過總理達拉第今日午後擬在國會所發關於德國行動之言論、兹有一事殊惹人注意、急進黨之伏倫台報、公然主張與德直接談判、謂如是可免牽涉法國舊日之恊約國及小恊約國、今唯法德諒解、始能担保歐洲與世界經濟復興所必要之安全云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法總理達拉第於週末休假之暇、尚數次與日内瓦通電話、與其同僚輩作長談、對於德國退出國聯及軍縮會議後局面上之政治法律諸觀察點、均有詳盡之討論、據今日政界方面所表示、法國此後之態度、約略如下、（一）法國願繼續進行軍縮會議之討論、且可對軍縮公約作預諾、（二）軍縮問題之討論祇可限於國聯組織範圍以内進行之、（三）現所提議之軍縮公約之實行、須俟德國簽字之後、（四）條約之完成、應以英國提案爲根據、（五）德法兩國間之交互磋商不成問題、因法國須保持其恊約國如波蘭及小恊約諸國之利益也、（六）若欲於四强公約範圍之内與德國開談判、亦須俟德國重新加入國聯之後此外政府機關報小巴黎人盛稱英法之交誼、實爲法蘭西政策之礎石、並希望兩國間能成立一眞實之同盟云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>皮尼土反對　日内瓦外談判</h3>
<p>予德時間認識大局</p>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會議之報告員捷克總代表皮尼士博士今日語路透訪員、謂由列强談判以成軍縮公約實不可能、公約必須由日内瓦成之、皮氏又謂今最佳之途徑、爲予德國以時間、俾其認識大局眞正之事實而消没完全孤立之思云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>匈總理談話　認時局有希望　對德舉動持以鎭靜</h3>
<p>匈京國務總理買博斯偕外長加尼亞頃已首途同往保加利亞京城、轉往土耳其、買氏於啓程之前、發表談話、謂德國退出軍縮會議一舉、匈國持以鎭靜、吾人觀於軍縮會議主席漢德森復文之語氣、與夫德國政府迭次所作之和平宣言、認爲當有希望、至將各民族分爲頭等二等之「策略」非吾人所贊同、各國「當於權利平等及安全之中、覓取解决時局之忠實方案」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>牛賴特　重申德國立塲　英計劃推翻表示不平</h3>
<p>（柏林）德外長牛賴特今日對外國新聞記者陳說德國立場、謂「吾人所最失望而訝異者、爲發見軍縮談判之基礎今已不復存在、因前由全體通過之英國計畫已不復存在也、此計畫雖發起人亦不承認之、反欲大加變更、今日大局之關鍵、爲戰勝國與戰敗國間之區別、抑承認德國爲國際團體中一份子、享有平等權之原則應許永久存在之問題、列强有意岐視德國實破壞國聯之基本觀念、試以軍備而言、法國所有重砲多於德國機關槍、而法國所有機關槍多於德國來復槍、多寡懸殊、有若是者、德國依允英國計畫、依允軍縮公約之時期五年、但反對試騐時期、而主張立即平等、德或準備將其國防軍立即改爲短役軍隊、但僅可於知悉他國欲置有何種戰具時聲明德國需要何種戰具耳、至於英外相西門在日内瓦所稱德國態度較前堅硬、要求較前更多之說、實屬不確」云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>德廢皇之言　盛稱希特勒之舉動　彼返國實不成問題</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹德國廢皇今日與人談話時、稱讚希特勒與國聯軍縮會議斷絶關係之舉動、謂德國爲國聯會員若是之久、此實極可異之事、德國雖具誠意加入國聯而恒受不平等之待遇、殊可歎也廢皇又謂渠之返國、實不成問題、渠深知希特勒目前有他事在籌畫中、而尚未遑及復辟事、夫復辟並未列入國家社會黨之程序中云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德外長牛賴特今日告路透訪員曰、德國不欲答覆漢德森批評德國退出軍縮會之函、如漢德森等以爲德國理由不充分、余唯有聽之而已、吾人已宣佈吾人之理由矣云、查漢德森覆函於主幹部開會通過後、送交德國、内稱、德政府採取甚嚴理之决定、而其所根據之理由、則爲渠所不能認爲充分者、蓋德國採此步驟、適在主幹會已决定將軍縮計畫及實現權利平等之適當保障辦法提交總委員會之時也云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍縮暫行休會　靜觀時局演進　各國代表離日内瓦</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會議總委員會本日開會、會塲人滿爲患、主席漢德森於全塲肅靜之中、報告星期六英外相西門對軍縮會議主席團說明之計畫、謂此項計畫爲軍縮公約有益之基礎、惟因德國退出軍縮會議、情形變動、故主席團僅請總委員會將此項計畫予以備案、旋即宣讀星期六德國退會之公文、以及軍縮會議方面擬致德國復文之草案、宣讀復文草案時、掌聲四起、惟匈牙利代表、以該國對軍縮問題所處地位、特别不同爲理由、謂該國代表、對於擬致德國之復文不能予以同意、蘇俄代表亦提出保留、但謂蘇俄之所以保留、乃因復文草案中、涉及一種計畫、未經徵求蘇俄意見、並不能認蘇俄之保留、係贊成德國態度、波蘭及土耳其代表、亦參加蘇俄代表之宣言、主席漢德森聞各該代表表示之意見、顯露不耐神色乃驟然言曰、復文草案旣無異議、則本日即電達柏森、旋即討論軍縮會議之前途、據渠所見、軍縮會議如欲成立軍縮公約、尚須經過種種困難、但以後所將採取之决定、將有嚴重結果、漢德森又提議於本月廿六日再行召集總委員會、此項提議未經討論即行通過、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法國彭古外長、英國西門外相·外次艾登·意大利代表蘇拉尼亞·波蘭外長柏克·均於今晚首途返國、惟美國代表台維斯尚留此間、軍縮會議現正鎭靜自持、對於德國不欲作何表示、并决定在十日之内、减少活動、以待局勢演進、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午三時、軍縮會議之主幹委員會舉行秘密會議、德代表缺席、而蘇俄代表杜夫加勒斯基則第一次出席、該委員會主席漢德森當即向委員會提出對於德國十月十四日退出軍縮會議牒文之復牒、漢氏復加以解釋、稱德國之退出軍縮會議、恰在該會業已經决定由滬委員會設法製成簡明之計劃、使德國所屢次引爲前題之均等問題成爲事實之後、</p>
<p>故德國此種行動、實可扼腕、而不可以理解云、下午四時、總委員會復集議、此爲總委員會本屆末次會議、故各國均由極重要之人員代表出席、主席漢德森復稱、德國外長牛賴特氏牒文中之三點、頗有討論之價值、而不可不加以答復、該三點約爲（一）軍縮會議决不能成就普遍軍備之减縮、（二）甚明了者即各列强對於軍備減縮之責任無實踐之誠意、（三）德國所要求之軍備平等之原則將永無實現之希望云云、漢德森氏稱、此三點於復牒中已詳加答復、該復牒遂由各國代表歡然通過後、各國代表復各有言論發表、而漢德森又謂德國之退出軍縮會議、却正在主幹委員會正將希望完成工作之際云、至於此後會議繼續與否、則漢德森贊成繼續進行云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>德新聞記者　侮辱軍縮會主席</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）代表國家社會黨報紙之德國某新聞記者、今晨在軍縮會塲前公然侮辱軍縮會主席漢德森、該記者停車於指定軍縮會主席停車之處、警察囑其離開、該記者置之不理、漢德森乃親自向之婉商、該記者竟以甚無禮貌之形式答之、謂渠不受其命令、並謂現已不復有軍縮會、故當然不復有軍縮會主席云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>漢德森　直言和戰關鍵　德雖退出軍縮必須進行</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會主席漢德森今晚在此發出播音演說、謂吾人現在應有之取捨、爲和平乎、抑戰爭乎、出於世界行動之循序的軍縮乎、抑互增攻守戰具之狂妄的競爭、或以新式戰爭恐怖與殘忍之經騐而墜入野蠻狀態中乎、大戰中死傷者而莊嚴責任加諸人類、而要求其不斷努力、阻止世界復入於另一大戰爭之黑暗中、故軍縮之奮鬥必須進行、而國聯盟約必須尊重不得視同廢紙、前人之所以犧牲生命於疆塲者、希望永不復有戰爭、吾輩豈可失信於亡人、縱德國退出、然軍縮會必須產生眞正公約、無論破壞者持何理由以搗毁法紀、吾輩不能聽令世界之法紀與秩序爲國際目無法紀者所搗毁、世界人民苟以維持國聯盟約與巴黎公約爲根據、而一致合作、則吾輩終可成立軍縮、保障和平、但若吾人聽令條約成爲具文、則吾人所得者、不爲軍縮、而爲另一戰爭、是以吾輩所負之責任至爲重大、吾輩其注視以國聯爲基礎之集合的和平制度不爲人所摧殘、（十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>美俄復交一旦　實現蘇俄對日不致孤立　赤軍集中西北利亞　日俄關係益尖銳化</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）自日俄東路爭執邇來有嚴重發展後、蘇俄已開始加厚遠東防務、蘇俄軍隊刻正集中於西伯利亞、其航空隊亦正逐漸東移、大宗軍需品亦方集中於該處、甚致有稱東部西伯利亞各地紅軍後備兵、已有一部份動員之說、但在此間尚不能切實徵實、此間觀察政事者鑒於日俄關係之尖銳化、認美俄復交已成爲異常切要之舉、蘇俄領袖深信美國承認蘇俄後、足以有效制止日軍閥之排俄冒險、華盛頓現方處於足以防止遠東戰事之地位、并信美國務院亦已注意及此云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄報紙　視歐洲如火山　世界和平發生危險</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄各報論德國退出國聯與軍縮會議、皆謂世界和平現發生危險、如眞理報載有一文稱、德國現對付美法英共同之陣綫、歐洲現已成一火山、資本主義之全世界刻方在備戰中云（十六路透電）</p>
<h3>日本積極　充實海軍力量　聯合艦隊提前改編　予西太平洋以威脅</h3>
<p>（東京）凖備非常時之昭和九年度日本聯合艦隊、擬比例年提早半月、於十一月中旬編制主力艦陸奥·金剛·將從第一線退出、蓄精養銳、而以改裝之榛名代之、航空戰隊鳳翔·加賀·退出、而代以新銳之航空母　龍驤及赤城立於第一線、又第一水雷戰隊、從來以第三驅逐隊編成之、現代以第四驅逐隊、蓋舉行極力充實内容之非常時編制、於是日本艦隊之威容益備、可以威壓西太平洋云、（十七日電通電）</p>
<h3>廣田外交基本政策　以不戰而勝爲要義　恃十足武力爲後盾　對華誘致親善對俄解决懸案　對美對英改善政治經濟關係</h3>
<p>（東京）日本内閣領袖昨日集議討論關於外交國防及財政之國家基本政策、外相廣田陳述其外交政策、分下述四項、（一）和平的外交須有充分國防爲後援、始可施行有效、但以不戰而勝爲要義、（二）日本外交政策目的在應付美俄華英、前三國爲日本之鄰國、後一國與日本有密切經濟關係、日本外交之主旨、在增進對此四國之友好關係、（三）爲實施上述政策起見、日本應立即解决對此數國之懸案、如中東路之轉移等是也、並應謀取各有關係國人民間之和諧、關於此點、應有若干政治上之提議、如成立美日間公斷條約之提議是也、（四）和平政策並不作對外屈服之解、日本凖備採取切實的獨立計畫、以應付尋常外交方法所不能處理之事件、因中俄兩國常蔑視國際信義、並從事宣傳與威嚇也、念及此點、故充分的國防實屬絶對必要云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日五相會議軍閥財閥對立　齋藤屈於軍部　不恤委曲求全　國策預算將分别審議</h3>
<p>（東京）集中内外觀聽之五相會議連開四次、而於從前建議之整理國防外交財政、各相之自由討論亦頗詳盡十六日之會議、雖經努力欲使達到總括之結論、然軍部與外交財政當局尚在意見對立形勢之中、未能融洽、如勉强使之歸納於一點、反使閣内之對立愈形激烈、並恐内閣之命運亦受重大影響、故政府有鑑於此、乃經愼重考慮、决將二十日之第五次會議希其暫告結束並不必勉强使之達到决定結果、當以第五次會議席上所發之言論、對於種種問題、表白毫無忌憚之意見、即可謂之收穫、而宣告閉幕、至明年度預算中之軍事費及國防國策之大綱、分别决定其具體情形、該項問題則當在大演習後之預算會議使之表面化云云、（十七日日聯社電）</p>

<p>官亦受其蒙蔽也、是則主動搆陷者、法院爲最高、而管理檢署者、法部又爲所蒙蔽、將何處可受反訴、若與其由地院、而高院、而最高院、歷百身莫贖之刑辱、終竟仍須上控于至高無上之監察機關、不若冒死先呈請鈞會予以公道、若請政府將鄭烈亦暫時解職、能與崔振華同至地院對質者、培基必立時遵傳到案、培基亦知法界不少</p>
<p>公正之人、能體鈞會監察之旨、有公平之審判、惟若鄭烈仍居最高檢察長地位、則所有檢察官皆惴惴焉恐受彼之中傷、檢察官卽難有公平之起訴也、謹呈中央監察委員會、（未完）</p>

<h3>各省糧食會議　粤代表温仲琦到滬　暢談粤征洋米稅問題</h3>
<p>國聞社云、蔣委員長召集各省糧食會議、於十月二十日在南昌開會、廣東省政府特派温仲琦代表出席、温爲粤省黨委、奉派後、以開會期間已迫、即趕乘總統輪、於昨午抵滬、寓大東旅社、記者以粤征洋米稅問題、極爲社會所注意、特往訪問、據談詳情如下、</p>
<h3>征收經過</h3>
<p>粤省徵收洋米稅、社會人士以其突然發表、頗多駭異、其實在政府方面、此事已經過長時間之醖釀、本年春、中華農學會粤會、在廣州開會議决、請粤省政府立卽</p>
<p>征收洋米稅、以救濟農村一案、省府以此舉關係重大、未卽行决定、後廣東政治研究會成立中華農學會、以該會會員廣東農林局長馮銳、亦爲政研會會員、故囑將該案向政研會提議、提出後、政研會交經濟組研究、經濟組前後討論數次、歷時三月、同時廣東各地農會·廣州市商會·之各重要同業以公會·各工會、紛紛請求政府、速行征收洋米入口稅、經濟組始將審查結果、呈報政研會、政研會一致通過、獻議省政府採擇、故就其歷程觀之、粤省征收米稅、可謂由民衆提議、民衆督促政府長期研究、始行實現、</p>
<h3>工商督促</h3>
<p>粤省有經濟眼光之商人、以商貨銷納全靠農村、年來市場冷淡、實因農村衰落、農民購買能力消失之故、而工人亦以爲市場繁榮、經濟復興之後、不致失業、工資可逐漸提高、所得過於所失、故當時表示反對者、祗有一部、洋米入口商人而已、但旋亦明瞭政府之政策、遵章繳稅矣、至於省政府所以未先將征稅之意、通知商人、而突然宣佈者、則以若行行通知米商、則米商可盡量預將洋米運入、是無異促米商於短期間内、盡量爲洋米傾銷、反使農村經濟頓受重大之打擊也、</p>
<h3>稅率問題</h3>
<p>現在洋米每担征稅一元、或有以爲稅率過高者、何但粤省、此次征洋米稅、其目的在救濟農村、而非爲增加收入、謀增加收入、則稅率須低、使洋米仍得興國米土米競爭、源源入口若目的在救濟農村、則稅率不能不高、粤省農村、受洋米傾銷結果、東北江南路一帶、每担穀價有祇值毫洋三元者、尚不足肥料人工種籽之費、若不以有效之稅額保障之、則農民惟有棄耕而已、吾人於此、有一事例、足爲君告者、粤省本爲產糖之區、最盛時、粤糖銷於閩贛各省、後爲爪哇菲律濱太古糖侵入、現在每年白糖入粤、達三千餘萬、廣東糖業、遂一敗塗地、至今政府擬復興糖業、設廠製造、而調查原料則蔗田已廢、政府雖欲急圖復興而不可能、故吾人於農村經濟、如不急圖救濟、至農田荒廢之後、則救濟亦已不易、所以當時决定稅率一元、並議决以徵稅收入、充發展農村經濟改良農業生產之用、</p>
<h3>現在米價</h3>
<p>此次粤米商反對政府征洋米稅、發出電報、動謂粤米祇足供四月之食、聳人聽聞之言、自民國元年以來、外米入粤統計、最少民國九年、祗七六七·一九六担、最多、民國十二年、一七·一二三·四四○担、平均、每年人口七百六十萬担左右、廣東人口三千五百萬、每人年食米至少平均三担、計每年至少須一萬零五百萬担、是粤米所不足者、不及十分之一、征收洋米稅後内地土米、可以運出城市、國米亦能運粤、故粤省糧食、實不成問題、年來粤省政府、積極作增加農業生產工作、試騐改良穀種已成功、祇以東莞白一項、每年可增加生產十分云云、現各縣已設推廣處推廣一切改良種籽農具於農村、故祇改自穀種一項、已可使粤省糧食有餘、現肥料製造廠、農具製造廠、已籌備設立、經費以洋米稅收入撥充、當征稅之初、米商曾一度居奇、米價提高一元左右、但旋卽降低、蓋安暹米價跌落、而國米土米同時湧至也、</p>
<h3>粤政研會</h3>
<p>温氏又談及廣東政治研究會、謂其性質如其名稱之所示、由黨政軍高級人員組織、研究廣東政治興革事宜、將研究結果、交各機關採擇施行、並不如外間所傳之一切也、廣東三年計畫、俱按照進度表切實進行、物質建設方面、已超過進度表之規定、計已完成者、有士敏士廠、疏酸廠、梳打廠、海珠鐵橋海珠塡堤等、現在建設中者、有絲織廠滃江水電廠、糖廠肥料廠、農具製造廠、廣州内港至廣汕鐵路三賀鐵路、亦在測量中云、</p>

<h3>好有一比</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>近代有幾個怪傑，他們發表的議論，總含有一種比喻的說明；宛比拙著四傑傳中的王好比，不開口便罷，開出口來，左一個好有一比，右一個好有一比。</p>
<p>意相墨索里尼在意大利國會裏演說；「和平條約，並平是永久有效；因爲，世界並不靜止，國家也有生命，生長，衰老，甚而至於死亡。要是，希望着和平條約永久有效，差不多把世界各國都變了僵屍。」</p>
<p>我把他的說話研究一下子，他的理論是不錯的，任何良法，總没有一成不變的道理，有了良法，也應有遵守良法的人，中國古語，呌做：「有治人，無治法，」法是死的，人是活的，「死店活人開」，死法子也要活人維持。意相的話，在原則上無可非議，但是，他的論調，恐不免要發生流弊。他以爲除是國家變了僵屍，和平條約才能永久有效，簡單說一句，他是一個不要和平條約的人了。試想現在高唱和平聲中，尚且免不掉有世界發生大戰的危險性；要是，明目張膽地提倡着我們不要和平條約，那麽現在成了什麽世界呢？</p>
<p>日本陸相荒木貞夫說：「日本好比一個大而且强的胃襄，東方文化也好，西方文化也好，完全都能把它消化了。這是由於日本精神自由而且强大，一點也不停積凝滯，任何東西都能兼包並蓄的緣故。」</p>
<p>我也把他的說話研究一下子，這可以表未日本軍閥的誇大狂。他在表面上說文化，說日本有强大的胃囊，足以消化種種的文化；其實，意有所指，他不是說文化，彷彿在說武化。他以爲日本有了强大的武化胃囊，東方土地也好。西方土地也好，什麽也好，完全都能把它消化了。凡是貪吃的，呌做饕餮家，那麽他們不是成了一個饕餮國麽？幣原外相說：「日本呑了滿洲，好似呑了炸彈。」難道日本强大的胃囊，可以消化炸彈麽？俗語說：「禍從口入」，區區胃囊，到底不是乾坤袋；吾所目見的，和人家賭吃湯　，尚且斷送了生命，何况呑了炸彈呢？只怕這個東洋胃囊，有些靠不住吧。</p>
<h3>說話美</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>說話：本來是吃飯的一個先鋒隊；即便事實也早這樣展佈着，世儘有靠了說話會平地一聲雷，無端的享到高官，厚爵，洋房，汽車，黄金，美色；世也有爲了不會說話致從本來在天堂的跌入地獄；再如：爲了不會說話而坐個反動罪名，爲了不會說話而吃官司，而殺頭的，那更是司空見慣，不足爲奇！</p>
<p>「愛美天然，」所以唯「美」才能博到人家的歡心，也可說是人生的另一種幸運，現在什麽都要講究個美化，甚至曲線有美，處女有美，都是這個道理，那末，人生最重要的說話，自然尤其要來一個美，這種「說話美」，也可喚做「說話藝術」，不過，說話怎樣算美？那是只能意會，不能言喻，粗淺的說個大槪，是這樣的：</p>
<p>要是你說話的對方面，名位比你高，腰纏也比你富，總之：一切都强過你的，那你說話時，務得在中間揷些閒文進去，這種閒文，亦名之曰「拍」，稍微肉麻些也不妨的，例如：說某一個人怎樣慈善時，就得說：像先生—對方—那麽熱心而慷慨的人；說人家做壞了一件事時，就得說：倘使先生—對方—趕了定會很好的；說某人討了個姨太太不安份時，就得說：要是這娘兒處在先生—對方丨的手腕下，不怕不服貼，如此···諸類的話：本來都很平凡的，就爲揷入了這些閒文丨拍丨進去，就如點鐵成金，美在其中，那使對方聽進耳朶，不就覺得樂意的多嗎？！</p>
<p>倘對一個不如你的人說話時，你就不當用拍，而該用「吹」，例如：你當轉述一句話時，得說昨天Ｘ廳長對我這般說：評論一件東西時，得說上次在Ｘ部長家裏吃飯時看見的比這更好，···這樣，自然會聳人聽聞，誰都當你是了不起的人了。</p>
<p>他如：對女人，對朋友，末而至於對家人，妻，子，不論說甚話甚？都得隨機應變，錦上添花，來一個完整的美化，···神而明之，存乎其人。</p>
<p>「說話美」了，吃飯問題，就無往而不勝利了！</p>
<h3>私與公</h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>有一天在蘇州，我獨自在街坊閒游，徒然前面擁着一簇人過來，我便站定觀看，那人叢裏一個警士，領着一個賣筆的老頭兒，一個穿夏布長衫的人，見他提高了喉嚨指手劃脚的朝那警士亂嚷，說什麽ＸＸ縣長，ＸＸＸ分局長，都是天天見面的知己朋友，我聽了他的斌調，來頭一定不小，却要跟去看看，究竟爲了何事。走到富郎中巷第二分駐所内，首先由警士向警官報告事實，然後警官問話。原來比人是辦黨務的職員，因老頭兒向他兜售生意，不料惱了他無名之火，不問情意，舉手就打，竟把老頭兒的筆都打落，還要挖出片子送他吃官司去。老頭兒呢，也不肯服氣，又被他打失二支筆，所以大家到警察局裏去解决的。</p>
<p>「黨」這個字，使人聽了就要吃嚇，何况還有縣長分局長是知己朋友。要賣筆的老頭兒吃官司，自然是稀鬆平常的事。但是：賣筆是營業，將本求利，何至於吃官司。憑了黨的威權，將窮老頭兒懲辦，未免大輕視這個「黨」字，黨高於一切，必須尊重這個黨字。依我看來，不過是施行他「私」的威權。</p>
<p>賣筆的老頭兒被他打落了二支筆，偏要他賠償，小本經營，自然吃虧不起。這但先生呢，偏生不賠，只顧把大招牌掮出來，欲使警官迴護他。不料剛才報告事實的警士，突然嚴厲地說：「如果他不賠這二支筆，警士也不幹了，公事不能公辦，什麽都弄不好了。」我聽了這幾句話，精神爲之一振。當警士的尚且懂得這個「公」字，甚至願意去職，何等高尚，使人肅然起敬。處處以公辦事的這位先生，不以公爲公，反以公爲私，無怪只要戤牌頭，儘管無法無天的幹好了。</p>
<p>「天下爲公」四個大字，無論政府，法院，什麽機關，都懸掛在正中，何等官冕堂皇。但，天下是否爲公，誠如所謂「不可說」也，我們小百姓也只能裝聾作啞假痴假呆，否則看了反而受氣了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十七回孰能無情家思灰干氣　兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>趙自强臉上，也只好帶上一種苦笑，微微的搖着頭道：咱們根本上說不上英雄兩個字，有什麽英雄氣？你進城去了嗎？田青搖着頭，歎了一口氣道：有一個排長告了假，上士也出去了，我走得開嗎？進城不像上海甸，來回就是幾個鐘頭，我認了罷，趙自强道：你說進城進不成，可是我到海甸去，也到不成呢。田青道：你有兩個鐘頭，還不夠來回的嗎？在這兩個鐘頭以内的工夫，我想你總也可以設法子的人。趙自强道：你那一連，只走了個排長，我這一連，可走了兩個排長啦，這也是你那一句話，認了罷。田青回頭望了一望低聲問他道：喂！老趙，你知道我們這次出發，是向那裏去嗎？趙自强道：我看决定是往東北，反正不能往西南。田青道：我聽說是上九門口。這要不和小鬼動手就算啦，要和小鬼動手，咱們可是最前線。趙自强也回頭看看，低聲道：這是咱們自己人說話。論到戰鬥力，我們可不行得很，爲什麽不調好一些的軍隊上那兒？田青道：也許不是上九門口。趙自强道：我和你打人賭，凖是出長城去。田青笑道：咱們瞎找慌作什麽。要到九門口去，不能因爲咱們害怕就下去。不到九門口去，咱們也别當是什麽幸事。我就最怕聽那句話，咱們東北軍是不抵抗的軍隊。你不是東北人，那還好一點。我是東北人，又穿了這樣一身灰衣服。一開口，說出奉天話來，人家瞪了兩隻大眼向我望着。他雖不說什麽，我心裏也明白，那不就是說的，你東北軍人有什麽用，自己的家都看守不住。趙自强笑着將大拇指一伸道：喝！你眞要彩，還跟人家賭這一下子氣啦。（二一五）</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>阿官</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>剛從媽媽肚裏爬出來，爸爸就給他取個名字丨呌做阿官。</p>
<p>是的，爸爸希望他將來做官，媽媽在希望上加個「更」字；就是十七八代祖宗在天之靈，也都希望他做官。我們阿官的將來，大槪官是做定的了！</p>
<p>奇怪，這未及匝歲的小小性靈，當你伸出手去逗他笑，拉長着調子喊他聲「···阿···官···」，他會舞動着手向你笑，跳，甚至呀呀地呌，可見阿官自身也在希望將來能做官。唔，這呌做胎裏毛病一！</p>
<p>眨眨眼，阿官長大得爬到幼稚院去了。不上幾年，他又鎭進小學堂，跳出中學校。左鄰王婆婆有意或無意地常在媽媽面前誇讚她的「三丫頭　的八字好，將來定做官太太的。於是爸爸媽媽也就想到他們有「抱孫子」的必要了。官，反正阿官將來是十拿九穩的，官太太却非早些預約不可！</p>
<p>不知是我們阿官的志氣好，還是他的眼界高，拒絶了爸爸媽媽一切應有的囉囌，跑這一所來者不拒的野鷄大學裏去了。他知道，像他爸爸所知道的一樣，没有進過大學，是夠不上做官資格的。這在爸爸當然没有什麽反對，媽媽却就有幾天嘰咕，說是阿官給「老甲魚」帶壞了</p>
<p>阿官初進大學，一切都感到新鮮。他在中學時代，雖曾傍着校門嚼過花生米，躺在操塲上評論過同學們的姊妹，偷點着洋燭看過無數不正當的小說，每逢考試就會啞聲地嚷着「派司：：：派司」；這是當時也就夠有趣的了。但一經踏進大學，這些就顯得幼稚可笑！他覺得學校生活丨尤其是大學丨絶不像意葾中那般枯燥和沉悶；快樂是要自己去追求的！因此他鬧過不少笑話，尤其在女生面前扮演過的喜劇或悲劇，使人談到就笑得肚痛！</p>
<p>阿官的内材雖說一塌糊塗，外材却高明得着實可以。他能踢幾脚球。田徑運動雖不見好，也還能對付。或許就是靠着運動員的牌頭吧，混上四年，在糊裏糊塗中，居然畢業了！</p>
<p>阿官戴上「天官帽」，披起「道士袍」，剛踏進社會就想過「官癮」，這在爸爸媽媽以前是認爲十拿九穩的，不料處處碰到「茄門貨」的釘子！</p>
<p>「咱們吃過麵包的還找不着飯碗哩，你是什麽東西」！阿官常常聽到這類的譏評。這在他倒無所謂，可是他的爸爸却氣苦了。一發狠，賣了田地房產給阿官去出洋。媽媽哭吵着好幾回，說是娶媳婦的錢化掉了，「三丫頭」是不喜歡那種「洋裏洋腔」的。</p>
<p>阿官起先預備到東京，後來聽說「東洋貨」不值錢，他才變計溜到西洋去。他初到美國的時候，有位同鄕跑到他寓所去看他，劈頭來上一句英語，“Ｈｏｗ　ｄｏ　ｙｏｕ　ｄｏ”　？阿官躊躇有頃，答道：“Ｉ　ｄｏ　ｎｏｔｈｉｎｇ”於是阿官就此出名了！　　其實，阿官倒没有撒謊，他在美國確鑿是「留」而不「學」實行其“Ｉ　ｄｏ　ｎｏｔｈｉｎｇ”主義的！</p>
<p>阿官在美國鬧的笑話雖多，但「酒排間」内却漸漸很少聽到他“Ｉ　ｄｏ　ｎｏｔｈｉｎｇ”一類的笑話了。當然，我們阿官是不斷地在進步的！</p>
<p>不知爲了什麽動因，「阿官逗留新大陸約有年半光景，悄然束裝返國。有的說是爲了戀愛問題，有的說是給學校除名了—但阿官究竟進什麽學校，讀些什麽，似乎没有人能詳細知道</p>
<p>一九三一年春天某一個晚上，有人在法國公園看到阿官，胸襟上佩着一個圓圓的東西，很神氣，據説，還伴着個女郎哩。如何！我說阿官將來一定會紅的，不過那女的又是什麽人？大槪不會是「三丫頭」吧！</p>

<h3>金融形勢轉趨暢旺</h3>
<p>連日金融界市面爲十月份長期交割關係、更爲高貨略有進展、故形勢鬧旺非常、拆息市價、早午市同爲六分、劃頭加水以頭襯過剩、始終大濫而做白劃、拆票交易、早市轉帳五百十餘萬、新交易四十餘萬、午市交易七十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、銀行收解、形勢亦復鼎盛、計外商銀行收解票欵銀二百五十六萬、洋三百十餘萬、特欵收解三百餘萬、各種貨物匯兌押墊雜欵收解銀五百十餘萬、洋五百四五十萬、進倉銀四十萬、洋五十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百九十餘萬、各種貨滙稅押墊雜諸欵收解是六百六七十萬、特欵收解四百九十餘萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行出倉銀四十萬、洋六十餘錢莊洋公單收解五千一百餘萬、洋劃頭欵九百三十餘萬、各路匯欵八十餘萬、解現四五十萬、洋押欵交易取贖八十餘萬、新做開九十餘萬、銷票收回及發出二百四五十萬、客路來源十萬、去胃二十五萬、又本市票</p>

<h3>紐約股市大落</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告十六日紐約股市、因歐洲形勢嚴重、物品市面疲弱、美元堅强、羣相賣出、致市况劇落、觀全日成交數目爲二·六七○·○○○股、可知已達買方之最高峯、酒股亦現疲弱、因政府宣佈以後、没收之酒、將不再毁壞、一般見解、以爲政府或將爲酒公賣也、股市收盤時稍向穩定、「小麥」國外情况紊亂、美英匯率不定、加以多頭了結、致麥市收盤時發見限制捐失定單、但仍利於買方也、「棉花」令人擔心之歐洲情形、與夫其他市况之不振、致棉市因之下跌、政府貸欵與農民之問題現在更較爲有引動力、而使存棉者有保持不出之價值、據報棉市根基尚穩、「銀」因大宗多頭了結銀市收盤時疲弱、美財部金價每兩爲二九元、兹將道瓊氏指數列後、</p>

<h3>紗花　限價進户提高標紗</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、因某棉業機關成立、致人心震動且商塲上傳說紛紜、本月份限八十四元購進、準備收貨、同時一般附和者亦屬不少、故外棉雖落、紗市未受若何影響、然環境仍劣、實銷難以大暢、日紗價格較低、前途如何、還在現銷上着想、</p>
<h3>人標漲元外</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以有限價八十四元購買、外棉雖跌、市面仍堅近漲五·七元、遠跌一元五角、午後聞多頭購買遠月、市况激動、各月漲七·八·九角至一元四·六角、全日成交統計四萬一千三百包、查賣出源大一千九百五十包、愼昌二千一百包、森康六百五十包、恒昌一千三百包、買進信誠一千三百五十包、恊生一千二百包、仁豐二千九百包、通記一千包、同和一千三百五十包、義餘一千零五十包、福大九百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花買方意態高昂</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲、但美棉大跌、而本棉未受若何打擊、因滙兌猛縮而十月份成交之額尚巨、解進之貨、仍以水分太重檢就者未多、於是買方怠態頗强、惟某廠商之空額、已有一萬多擔劃賬、現棉生意異常清淡、各廠皆無辦胃云、</p>
<h3>鄭標堅穩</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、隨外棉不佳而跌二·三角、二三盤又回漲、結果近月漲五分、遠跌五分至一角、午後市氣頗緊、近漲一角半至三角、遠漲二角半、全日成交統計八萬二千二百擔、查賣出裕康二千五百擔、大豐四千五百擔、源大六千七百擔、泰興二千五百擔、益昶二千一百擔、長和二千一百擔、買進仁豐四千五百擔、信誠六千三百擔、長</p>

<h3>美棉跌勢驟速</h3>

<h3>糧食　米銷不振再跌二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源五十餘號、市况自昨市一度横跌後、今則餘波未息、總因來貨尚旺、銷化不振、客帮包胃僅辦窰中六七百包、破粳二百餘包、是以各帮窰中百哥等新粳價續贬一二角、破粳亦修二尺、新杜洋等洋蘇同帮以去路較佳、已能轉定、餘如青角楓練等帮仍落角許、新陰元銷路不廣、再低角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）河下各路到船四十餘號、市銷尚活、破粳新杜尖價小角外、西新粳薄稻價削二三角、白元羊尖亦小二角、新窰種百哥價跌四五角、埠尖客尖略有上落、</p>
<h3>期粉麥大跌小回</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、仍見繼續回跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又跌一元六七角、坎拿大跌二三角左右、故開盤後、人心當然不振、本月份開價卽低二元零一分、遠期各月份、亦較前日跌一二分不等、惟市面跌到此種地步、實在已有跌無可跌之勢、故以後因浮空之抵補、及臨時多頭之吸收、近期人心已穩、遠期因大廠續出、依然疲滯、迨至下午開盤、初尚平平、　因廠家抛售已寂、而市場之投機浮空、因預測洋麥可暫停跌　、所以各月份均步步楊進、或則臨時搶買、故各月份遂跌而反好、兼之本月份因慘跌後、各廠現貨、已無别價、均須照標準直抽、人心遂連帶回振矣、結果十、十一月份較前回漲二分二厘半、十二月份跌一分七厘半、一二月份跌一分二厘半、三月漲一分、</p>
<p>麥市昨日期麥上午開盤後、又見巨大之衢跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又落一元六七角、坎拿大跌二三角、故開價後、人心之虚軟、已達極點、本月份竟低至三元六角一分、十一月份低至三元六角八分、十二月份至三元七角、一月份至七角四分、二三月份至七角五六分、較前日均落四五六分不等、迨至下午開盤、初仍平定、出入尚微、後以期粉轉俏、各月份之買氣、亦隨之轉旺、并因一部空頭暢補、市氣亦步步上升、此種大跌小回、亦交易所市塲所常見也、結果祇十一月份較好一分、十二月份好二分、餘無出入、現麥因標準大跌之後、廠方亦舉足不定、恐非殺短一二角、難求受主云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白小去五分</h3>
<p>昨糖市以標金雖升、交易仍稀、趨勢平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃二十一元五角半、比前日小去五分、荷赤無變動、八九號仍劃十六元七角半至七角、太古糖呌原價未成、中華國華振記一號劃二十元三角原價、餘　退、潮青號盤略有鬆落、昨開二百餘包、價爲十五元四五角至二角、海南赤久無開出、昨號方呌十五元五六角、尚未成盤、據汕頭電訊、潮青日前雖有小跌、兹復回升、且存底不多、恐難過小也、</p>
<h3>南北貨　同安新元肉到貨仍少</h3>
<p>新生晒圓肉近日到貨仍稀、地價極昂、同安貨全新好貨、昨復有少數開出、價爲七十五元、聞石碼貨地價因步漲過高、直接採者甚少、故據近訊、樝已回鬆、比最高時相差近十元、但劃申仍需百元之譜、</p>
<h3>油市　自桐油稍見轉機</h3>
<p>白桐油漢市自跌售洋莊每擔二十五元後、旋又續跌至二十四元四角、當因洋行停而不辦、致市面似無轉機可能、乃昨據漢函所詳、　洋交突見發動、曾辦過百餘噸、價售二十五元一角、嗣加至二十五元二角、有五六十噸交易、而行家開進襄桐亦加價至二十元零五六角、故市情已稍見轉機、可見市面變動、非一般人所能料及、本埠號家因銷已零落、不甚注意、浙桐存數已薄、杭行出外銷售不肯過廉、產新尚有一月之遙、大槪新油未出以前、浙路無大變化也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　下檔直貢缺貨如故、</h3>
<p>下檔五元光竟元青直貢呢、邇來趨勢仍極俏活、吸户依然不少、蓋新貨成本高昂、有推銷能力者咸向市上搜羅現貨、存底非常缺乏、刻雙面元十貢呢最便廉爲前寗豐行所開出之現貨、華孚泰·承大·新昌所吸收每碼批售洋五元二角半、（按寗豐寫出祇有四元七角）查此外下檔直貢大半多已售罄、普通單面直貢每碼售洋三元八角七分五厘、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵皮銷路活潑</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮近因天時漸寒、北路客帮均爭先購辦、故數日來成交良好、行情直上、現市如二尺·六尺十八張貨每擔售十一元八角、比前好起一角半、三尺六尺則估十一元二角半、而本街搪磁廠胃口亦甚活潑、所以市上成交頗形踴躍、查昨日開出達四五百擔之多、惟市上之貨自經收辦後、十分稀少、行情仍有看好之可能云、</p>
<h3>英白鐵新到千餘擔</h3>
<p>昨日新太古棧裝到厚薄英白鐵一千六百餘擔、市上散斷擋之二十六號二十八號等花色、從此已有接濟、故無軋缺之憂、其價現市六尺售一元一角七分、七尺一元三角八分、二十八號十七元五角、二十六號十六元五角、二十四號二十五元五角、聞昨已抛出二百餘擔云、</p>

<p>丨明日滬粤奪錦標丨</p>
<p>（南京十七日電）上海勝香港、良非易事、廣東勝河北、亦頗吃力、明日上海與廣東將一較身手、究竟錦標之歸滬屬粤、尚難預測、但屆時必成全運會最驚心動目之一幕也、</p>
<h3>廣東敗河北</h3>
<p>▲結果四對一</p>
<p>足球複賽、粤勝冀、十七午後二時、足球複賽在田徑場舉行、觀衆萬餘人、林森于右任王正廷褚民誼等各要人多到、形勢緊張、第一場、粤以四對一勝冀、第二場、滬以一對零勝港、粤滬獲得决賽、定十九午後三時作最後决賽、足球錦標是滬是粤、行見兩隊健兒之奮隊角逐也、粤冀兩隊、以南方之雄、與北地好漢較量、粤以連絡活潑見長、冀以氣力脚頭見勝、未賽前、羣知粤隊必勝、但欲看冀隊努力程度之如何减低其紀錄耳、裁判員陳吉祥、巡邊員周家驥李祖祺、</p>
<p>▲葉北華首開紀錄</p>
<p>開賽之初、兩隊爭殺、旗鼓相當、五分鐘無勝負、粤中鋒朱國倫連絡葉華北楊水益傳球迅速、朱曾攻門三次、球如彈發、均越門而過、至十分鐘時、始由葉北華盤球入内衛線伸脚一踢、急而有力、球飛入網内、首開紀錄、</p>
<p>▲姜璐建功成平局</p>
<p>未三分鐘胡天寳趕上一脚球中門柱、仍被彈出、至是冀隊開始反攻、五鋒如生龍活虎、排山倒海而來、李天生麥蘇急喚奈何冀内鋒張長裕得球交左守門見事危急、奔出救球姜卽踢球入網、立成一對一之紀錄、</p>
<p>▲葉北華再度凱旋</p>
<p>至時戰事更爲劇烈、朱國倫率領衆英雄、運步攻打、均被陳而得救出、觀衆大呼爲鐵門第二、數次成角球、亦未奏功、第三分鐘、粤右鋒胡天寳迎球直馳、踢與葉北華、落地極佳、葉以迅雷不及掩耳手段、又獲一球、成二對一粤佔先、冀軍再度反攻、卒不能逃李天生、費盡心力、終無效果、其後雙方互有險球、均未中的、上半時二對一粤勝、</p>
<p>▲李葉努力竟全功</p>
<p>下半時易地再戰、冀順風踢球、五分鐘間、冀軍圍打粤門黄紀良、撲地撥球、始得保全、肉搏相持至二十分鐘、粤李鴻清得一極好機會、發脚攻門、又中一只、冀軍拚命抵抗、内衛尤能盡力、冀雖有五次被罰踢球、均向門踢出至二十八分鐘、葉北華復乘虛而入、陳而得措手不及、又進一廣東游泳隊</p>
<p>球、是後雙方卽成相持之局、下半時卽以二比零告終、總分四比二、粤勝、冀軍守門本爲斷輪老手、天津埠隊賽曾充守門、經騐豐富、是役也、表演之佳、亦首推陳君、</p>

<h3>上海克香港</h3>
<p>▲結果一對零</p>
<p>（南京十七日電）十七日午後四時、足球複賽第二場滬以一比零勝港、兩隊實力在伯仲之間、前鋒連絡、滬隊較佳、後衛則滬勝於港、港以林學燦守門、等守門包家平改充中鋒、確極勇敢、上場一刹那間、港輸去一球、卽以是一分之差失敗、未免寃極、滬隊後衛李寗江善敬有驚人表演、周賢言救出險球、不下一打之多、揮打脚踢、倒地撲救、如演唱白水灘之青面虎、博得全塲一片掌聲、否則滬隊必輸無疑、確爲第一動臣也、</p>
<p>▲飛將軍破空而下</p>
<p>裁判員何春暉銀笛一聲大戰開始滬軍中鋒李義臣、以迅雷不及掩耳之脚步進敵營、梁賢贊一脚踢出、徐亞輝趕上以一脚落地極佳李迎頭往趕、不候球停、用頭頂去、正落網内、首開紀錄、離開球僅一分鐘、守門林學燦以爲飛將軍自天而降、呆若木鷄、觀衆掌聲與歡笑聲全作、</p>
<p>▲周鐵門力抗羣雄</p>
<p>港隊旣遭意外之災、全線反攻、包家平率領大小兒郎、滾滾而來、以長派司法、使滬隊疲於奔命、港右内鋒黄美順在十二　處、得球拚命一脚已成不可救之局面、周賢言横身一撲、卒被救出、彩聲雷動、雙方繼續作戰、怱來怱往、砲彈式之飛球、來去無定、時戰事之烈、可窺一班、第十五分鐘、黄美順又來攻門、球被周接住、港鄭季良斜側裡直撲周身、周不及避、撞倒地上、而球終被救出、嗣後十餘分鐘間、滬門無時不在萬分緊張危急之中、有一次包家平踢攻一脚、黄美順次攻二次、球如飛矢急而有力均連續被周賢言用拳打出、非周不能救此次險球也、港軍一再失敗、攻勢漸緩、滬隊間亦還以顏色、但林學燦亦非弱者、不能輕易失手、上半時滬以一對零估先</p>
<p>▲圖反攻力不從心</p>
<p>休息時間、港敎練頻頻授以作戰策略下半時易地再戰、港軍陣綫更動、内鋒梁達榮退出、易以鄭季良、改以伍寳榘任左鋒甘　惠任右鋒、上塲之初、果然聲勢不同球如雪片飛來、周賢言香港足球</p>
<p>鐵門態度鎭靜、左擋右揆、無不得心應手、滬軍乘機反攻、李義臣一身打門被接住、孫錦順接連二脚、一脚接住、脚打在右門柱上、球復彈回、相差僅間一險極、未幾、港連續被罰踢球、先後由陳家球主踢、均未奏功、</p>
<h3>盡職守壯士受傷</h3>
<p>至廿分鐘時、港左鋒伍寳榘傳球沿邊線進攻、江善敬拚命在後追趕至左邊角線間、伍猛力與江相撞、頭部適在江頓時倒地不起、經童子軍救護、以内部受傷、仍未能起立、卽時應戰、乃抬入救護床出場、代以顧尚勷應戰、至是滬隊改取守勢、防線異常嚴密、港軍雖勇、終不能越雷池一步、時暮色蒼茫、時間迫促、港軍求勝心切　不顧一切横衝直撞、多以心慌意亂、欲速則不達、時時被李　等援住、眞是哭笑不得至最後一分鐘時李義臣率衆還攻港門、孫錦順斜身一脚、林天燦與銀笛聲同時接住、此賽告終、滬以一比零獲得决賽權、定十九與粤决賽足球錦標、鹿死誰手、未易言也</p>

<h3>第一單打</h3>
<p>十七晨男女網球複賽均賽一第一單打、滬邱飛海對巴許承基吸引巨量觀衆、表演之精彩、堪嘆觀止、邱夙負盛名、但被許玩弄於手掌之間、一籌莫展、竟以直落三敗、比數爲三比六、二比六、零六比、且每盤均有全失之可能、誠爲邱生平第一次之　遇、川冀之第一單打、川林亦以直落三勝　兹記祥情如下、</p>

<h3>許邱鏖戰記</h3>
<p>▲滿坑滿谷之觀衆網球場面積狹小、每場用鉛絲網隔斷、看台僅一面、不能容納多量觀衆、許邱交鋒、愛好網球者、無不欲一飽看福、八時過後、觀衆陸續光臨、佔據坐位、鵠候大戰、後來者均擠於行人道上、及鉛絲網邊、眞是滿坑滿谷、水洩不通、而鉛絲網隨時有崩潰之危險、此賽如在上海舉行、門票至少要售兩元、在此僅須大洋一角、卽可飽嘗看福、無怪觀衆趨之如狂、</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>▲觀衆驅逐裁判員如此重大比賽、裁判員巡邊員、非得由精明幹練者、不能勝任、不料網球裁判長凌道揚、不計及此、僅派巡邊員二人、裁判之職、由一毫無知識與經騐之在汪某担任、每　開始、錯誤百出、手鈍眼笨、勝負之分、簡直莫明其妙、許邱二君、爲之一呆、觀衆大譁、高聲辱駡、並要求更換裁判、汪某面紅耳赤、然　不肯下台、比賽乃至於暫停、滬指導張子震與裁判長凌道揚、商議更換、並添派巡邊員、汪乃廢然下台、比賽遂得順利進行、此場風波發生、僅賽二局耳、</p>
<p>▲許承基表演突佳完全小孩面孔之許承基、日前與高惠民戰、並未有特殊表演、故一般人或以爲邱可獲勝、不料昨是今非、判若二人、上塲開始、許左右逢源、得心應手、無孔不猶、重如砲彈之發球、使邱毫無還架能力、雷霆萬鈞之高壓、使邱復興望洋之歎、邱之抽球、力處勁不及許之遠甚、許或用峻急如矢之抽球、直射底線、或有極輕之軟球、僅挑過網邊、使邱疲於奔命、罔知所措、攔網之佳、尤爲邱所深懼、許入處表演其特殊高妙之技術、使觀衆笑口常開、采聲不絶、又如高球壓擊、能在底線猛殺過網、國内前未得見、而攻擊部位之佳、猶其餘事、總之許之技術、在國内確屬創見、足與日本佐藤次郎嫓美、後生可造、望我體育界重用之、而爲國爭海外之榮光、</p>
<p>男子五十公尺自由式决賽第二粤　其松</p>
<p>▲邱飛海智窮力竭觀邱雖悉心對付、但千方百計、智窮力竭、無法可想、猛抽旣不能奏效、智取又鮮有建樹、若用高球窘敵、正予許暢所欲爲、大刀闊斧、重壓殺回、毫無反攻之機會、形勢懸殊、殊無法招架、觀者雖力竭聲嘶、狂呼讚美、然猶不足以窮其神妙、三盤結果、邱僅得五局、然已屬幸致、蓋是賽中、邱在在有光局及光盤之危險性、誠爲邱生平之大慘敗、</p>
<p>▲用球關係之批評邱之如此大收、所用之球、亦有關係、邱用慣鄧普祿球、以其彈性弛緩、較易控制、事前邱曾與許接洽、二人同意、願用鄧祿普球、但大會未准、必須用大會規定之史拉人傑球、此爲邱之大吃虧、而許出手甚快、正得其妙、故邱莫測球之性情、每有用力不當、出界之球甚多、此亦邱所以大敗之原因、</p>
<p>▲最後勝利屬夢想自滬得複賽權後、邱飛海與許承基之比賽、已在醖釀中、有人詢邱、前在爪哇曾兩敗於許、今番可能戰勝乎、邱自豪曰、余確曾兩次爲許擊敗、但今番最後勝利、將屬余矣、雄心雖大、其願難償、此次交鋒、非特未能戰勝、且大敗而特敗、壯志未酬、良深惆悵、然吾國網球界之異材出現、實爲可喜可賀之事、全運閉幕、許邱或將來滬、再决雌雄、</p>
<p>▲二人鏖戰之經過許邱兩人、於九時正、登塲先作練習、未幾開始、比賽第一盤、競爭稍烈、先由邱發球、取得首局、繼卽各得發球局、直至三三平手後、邱發球失利、遂以三比四屈居下風、後許砲彈式之發球、使邱招架爲難、邱又遭失利於是許以五比三局遙遙居上、最後邱發球、滿望拔回一局、但不幸又以發球雙失誤送去、而首盤勝利、遂歸許得、第一盤許挾首盤戰勝餘威、氣燄萬丈、一氣連下五局、邱岌岌可危、幾以光盤敗北、幸扳回發球局、繼又勝許之發球局、成五比二局、許領前、衆料邱或有轉機希望、但終因球藝稍差、卒遭慘敗、許又以六比二獲第二盤、三盤開始、邱一蹶不振、全受許之控制、卽其最拿手之底線長抽、亦不得施展、許則鋒芒大露、得心應手、失誤全無、一氣成六局、許以光盤再獲最後之勝利、總計許以以六比三、六比二、六比零、之直落三勝</p>
<h3>林寳華大勝</h3>
<p>四川對河北之第一平打、川由林寳華出場、而冀則用第四第角陶少甫應戰、此中不免有賣關子之非正當手段、予川以不利、林輕描淡寫、得心應手、陶技術平平、招架不暇遑論進攻、三盤結果、僅賽二十三盤、林以六比二、六比二、及六比一連勝、殊爲容易、</p>
<h3>第二單打</h3>
<p>十七下午二時起、男子網球繼續複賽、計滬對巴川對冀、單雙打各兩組、雙打巴棄權與滬、冀勝川、第二單打、滬勝巴、川勝冀、總計滬可各以二比一海汰巴冀、而得决賽權滬川將於十九决賽、以定錦標之誰屬、滬隊人材平均、各個技藝較優、錦標十有九種、</p>
<h3>王文正勝林續音</h3>
<p>滬巴第二單打、於午後三時開賽、滬上午失一單打、雙打巴棄權、因之第二單打之勝負、至關重要、故雙方各出全力以爭、滬由王文正充任斯職、對手林續音、球藝甚佳、但王已有成作、處之泰然、首盤開始、王卽大顯神通、一氣呵成五局、以五比零遙佔上風、然王十分客氣、不願使林過分難堪、情讓一局、終王以六比一獲首盤、第二盤起王已深知林之底細、故敷衍應戰、絶不施猛烈之截擊、故林得追隨於後、比數較爲接近、但結果王仍以七比五得第二盤、第三王再顯顏色、連下四局、林則一籌莫展、坐觀其敗、繼林奮勇力戰、挽回兩局、嗣後王又得兩局、遂以直落三勝、各盤比數、爲六比一、七比五、六比二、均王勝、</p>
<h3>錢耀彬克陳仲良</h3>
<p>川錢耀彬對冀陳仲良之賽、亦於三時起始、錢之球藝、尚稱佳妙、抽殺有勁、惟欠把握、陳之技術爾爾、故錢勝來極易、結果錢以六比二、六比三、六比三之直落三勝、</p>
<p>廣東游泳隊二百公尺自由式接力選手自左至右陳振興陳其松王秀山劉寳希黄義和指導</p>
<h3>雙打比賽</h3>
<p>▲冀勝川吧棄權</p>
<p>雙打賽、冀梁鎭文、金惠生與川李南鄭祖駒、球藝相差、惟梁金合作稍佳、故得最後勝利、首兩盤、競爭甚烈、後兩盤李鄭一蹶不振、四盤結果、冀梁金以一比六、九比七、六比一、六比一勝、吧城雙打棄於權上海、</p>

<p>王春菁（晋）（六比一　六比四）黄淑懿（平）</p>
<p>鮑大經（川）（六比一　六比二）茅於文（滬）</p>
<p>▲王春菁勝黄淑懿</p>
<p>晋王春菁女士、母係英國人、故其面容畢肖西洋女子、打得一手好網球、揮拍自如、熟能生巧、平黄女士、亦屬老手、蜚聲平津、但相形之下、形勢竟然懸殊、第一盤平黄僅得一局、晋王以六比一</p>
<p>勝、於此可見王春菁之技術、的係不凡、第二盤黄努力反抗、競爭甚烈、然最後勝利、仍歸晋以六比四勝、</p>
<p>▲鮑大經濟茅於文</p>
<p>川第一單打、川選手爲小大塊頭、鮑大徑、對滬冠軍茅於文、表演平平、球勢弛緩、茅多自殺、連負兩盤、川以六比一、六比二勝、</p>

<p>▲滬慘遭淘汰</p>
<p>川旣棄權雙打、滬川决賽權之爭、全在第二單打之勝負、川黎玉品藝甚可觀、與小大塊頭鮑大經、堪稱伯仲、滬黄志芳球術平平、且缺少經騐、致連非兩盤、結果黎以六比二、六比零勝、</p>
<p>▲晋最後勝平</p>
<p>平盧惠卿斯雅珊對晋孫貴秀常士熙之雙打、盧斯得勝頗爲容易、孫常遠非其敵、結果盧斯以六比二、六比一連勝兩盤、於是第二單打爲平晋之勝負關鍵、平黄淑清藝甚不惡、幾次斬球、博得全場掌聲、但晋王春威經騐豐富、球術純熟、黄雖屢思反攻、終屬無力、兩盤結果、六比一、六比二、晋王獲得最後勝利、</p>

<h3>男女球類今日形勢</h3>
<p>十八日球類複有賽、兩種、决賽有三種、滬隊均有出場與賽資格、而對手均屬廣東、故不啻爲滬粤對抗、競爭形勢、當較十七日更有激烈、</p>
<h3>男排球决賽</h3>
<p>排球滬之擊敗香港、中排丘廣燮、盧康元之重壓、曾廷贊之居中遞送、前排攔網之堅固、徐亨手法之活靈、與後排挽球迎送之老練、不可多見、决賽之對手、爲粤、該隊名將黎連　居前排、中央十分可怕、爲元巨之重壓、足與丘廣爕媲美、兩隊人材平均、旗鼓相當、一塲惡戰、未知鹿死誰手、而表演之精彩、當較滬港尤佳、誠不可多見之鏖戰、</p>
<h3>女籃球决賽</h3>
<p>滬女籃球隊、初無奪標之希望、但奪標雄心、則甚堅决、果然能將唯一之勁敵福建女子擊敗、希望乃油然而生、十八日决賽之對手爲廣東、亦殊强勁、下午二時交鋒、其競爭之劇烈、預料不下與福建之一戰、</p>
<h3>女壘球决賽</h3>
<p>意想不到初出茅廬之滬女壘球隊、能得决賽資格、自以十三比八戰勝歷史悠久之華北冠軍北平隊後、全隊精神、異常奮發、乃進而生奪標之雄心、誠可謂不鳴則已、一鳴驚人、決賽對手、亦爲廣東、勝足殊難、預測粤以打擊猛烈勝、滬以佈局森嚴勝、錦標誰得、可勿論滬隊進步之速、殊欣慰、</p>
<h3>男籃球複賽</h3>
<p>蘇男籃球定十八晨複賽、上海亦遇廣東、滬擅智取、粤長力戰、各有千秋、必有劇戰、上海或可操得勝券、冀京之戰、實力均强、論陣容、冀勝一　、就各隊觀察、冀智勇兼全、最有造詣、錦標賽應歸冀得、</p>
<h3>女排球複賽</h3>
<p>女排球滬粤實力很强、不幸遇於複賽中、粤負盛名、已久與男子同、惟本屆粤男子已有動搖之勢、而女子亦然、滬女隊聯絡甚佳、佈局嚴整、加以關柳珠黄杏芬之殺球利害、粤雖强悍、未可樂觀、中车組複賽、港似可以勝平、</p>
<h3>男女總錦標</h3>
<p>男子滬已得田徑全能三錦標、若再得一、任何球類錦標、卽可得總錦標、而網球滬可穩勝、他如排球足球、已得决賽權、亦有相當希望、總之滬已可穩勝得男子總錦標、女子方面、滬已得田徑冠軍、假如能再於排球壘球籃球三項中、任得一錦標、亦有女子總錦標、希望除滬外、尚有女子總錦標希望者爲粤港、總之球類錦標、除女網球外、爲滬粤港三區分爭、</p>
<p>最後掙扎羅宗興竟得一分、香港反攻、鄭發雖佔二壘、依然毫無結果、於是三比三不分勝負延長比賽、第八局雙方、均未得逞、第九局羅宗興安打、羅宗明又回球送、鮑文沙救回羅宗興、河北以四比三勝、得决賽權、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>讀了「處女和登龍」以後</h3>
<p>— 水</p>
<p>前幾天的「自由談」上有一篇「處女和登龍，」彎彎曲說了許多很幽默的話，而大意則謂凡雜誌之提拔處女作云云，都是替老板的錢袋設法。</p>
<p>這樣的論斷，眞比老吏斷獄還痛快。</p>
<p>但是因此我想起了另一樁事了：就是俗語所謂「舌頭是扁的，說話是圓的。」一個人的議論亦往往早晚市價不同。早上可以痛恨「老作家」把持什麽什麽刊物，可以大聲疾呼主張刊物應該盡量介紹新進作家，處女作，到了晚上，又一變而爲幽默地譏諷那提拔處女作之類不過是替老板的錢袋打算盤了。這中間的「契機，」只有天曉得！</p>
<p>不過倘若依照「處女和登龍」作者的「錢袋論，」則亦可以推想姿爲什麽個人的早晚議論不同。狐狸說葡萄是酸的寓言在這裏又一度耐人深思了。</p>
<p>如果劈開了「錢袋論，」那麽問題就只在作品之是否值得介紹。要是值得介紹的作品，不管牠是眞正處女，或者已是「婦人」而被誤認爲處女，（像「處女和登龍」文中所舉的某君之作，）都不關重要。問題原是很簡單的，我就不懂爲什麽一定要「唯物史觀」地從「錢袋」出發？</p>
<p>中國現在還没有一本詳備的「歷年來各雜誌索引，」所以一位作家從前即使發表過作品，（已經不是處女了，）人家不能記起來，亦屬稀鬆平常：這也是很簡單的一回事，爲什麽要說是被當做處女出賣？</p>
<p>這些疑問，光景也只有一句答案：「舌頭是扁的，說話是圓的，」如此而已。</p>
<h3>忍辱與耐痛</h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>據說，前幾天，在海京伯馬戲場的門口，一個中國看客，不知怎的，衝撞了一個外國巡捕，被那巡捕打了耳光，這人於是大聲呼號：「中國人齊心呀！中國人齊心呀」！因爲馬戲塲前，正有不少的中國看客，所以他想激動他們的公債，去懲戒那個巡捕，然而當時竟没有一個人理他，只在事後，有些議論紛紛，據最明事理的人說來，這個被打的中國人的呼號，在那時候，當然是無人理會的，因爲人們正忙於擠進戲塲，要去看馬戲呢。而且外國巡捕打中</p>
<p>國人的耳光，是極平常的事，而且是個人之事，何必大驚小怪，故意張皇，算做國恥。要是這也算起國恥來，則每年的國恥紀念大會，還</p>
<p>開得完麽？</p>
<p>這事的是非曲直，我以爲如此公所論，已極　當，我不想再說。但我因此想到，有兩種精神，在中國雖已普及，但是還不曾有人公然提倡，而實際是很需要的，我想趁此機會說一下。這兩種精神是：忍辱耐痛。前者是關於精神方面的，後者是關於肉體方面的。</p>
<p>現在就從前面所說的事件說起。被外國巡捕打了耳光的這個人，一方面感到痛楚，另一方面就感到恥辱，心裏不平是當然的，想要反抗，也是當然的，然而，對手是外國人，而且還有槍，一個人是反抗不過的，於是想借同胞們的恊力，然而同胞們不來理，你這是多麽没興兒？要是當初不呼號，忍些辱，耐些痛，不聲不響地，往人叢一鐵，誰也不知道你曾吃過耳光，這是多麽省事。幸而其他的看客能夠不把害事當做國恥，或者當做國恥而能夠忍耐，否則，眞個鬧了起來，豈但海京伯的馬戲，會就此閉幕，也許竟至鬧出驚天動地的慘劇來，造成一個更大的眞正的國恥，貽禍全國，而一耳光之恥仍未得雪，這是多麽失算啊？</p>
<p>「小不忍則亂大謀」，聖人早已說過，這位看客竟不曾想到。</p>
<p>照歷來的情形看來，中國人的忍辱的程度，還算不錯。這大槪是　師德先生提倡之功，同時也因爲辱是精神方面的，還容易忍得，至於痛，則因肉身所受，感覺較爲銳利分明，所以忍耐不易。吃耳光而覺得憤憤者，也許多半還由於痛。但是做了中國人，實在很有耐痛之必要，我現在舉出幾個耐痛的故事來，以作範例</p>
<p>傳說最普遍的，莫過於三國演義上的夏后惇拔矢啖睛，關雲長刮骨療毒。他如北史：「魏長生子彥，墜馬折臂，肘上骨起寸餘，乃開肉鋸骨，流血數升，言笑自若」。五代史：「　從簡中流失，鏃入骨，工無良藥，欲鑿其骨出之。從簡便令鑿之，工遲疑不忍下，從簡趣之，左右皆若不勝其苦，而從簡自苦」。這些人都有關公之風。</p>
<p>在羅馬的傳說上，我所知道的，也有兩個極能耐痛的人。</p>
<p>一個是Ｍｕｃｉｕｓｓｃｏｅｖｏｌａ當羅馬爲Ｅｔｒｏｓｑｕｃｓ王的軍隊所圍時，Ｍｕｃｉｕｓ剌王不中，被執，王以「死」和「痛苦」二事令其自擇。他表示一無所懼，自己把右臂放在火爐上，自肩以下，燒炙成灰，而毫無痛苦之狀，且對王說，羅馬城内，像他這樣英勇的剌客，有三百個，皆欲死王。王　，圍遂解。</p>
<p>這故事是極動人的，但中國人用不到模仿，因爲中國一旦被外國所圍的時候，雖有這樣的愛國志士，也是不能解救的，倘有人也是這樣做去，則徒苦無功，太不值得了，我們還是師法另一個人罷。</p>
<p>這人是個奴隸，然而也是個哲學家，名呌Ｅｐｉｃｔｅｔｅ。有一次，他的主人在賓客之前把他的手臂扭着玩，扭得很用力，快要斷了，於是他警告道：「你再扭過去，就要斷了」。他的主人果然再扭過去，果然斷了，但是他毫無痛苦之狀，反而自幸其言中，對主人道：「我不是對你說過的麽」？</p>
<p>對於預備做奴隸的中國人，這位奴隸哲學家的態度，是最好的榜樣。他旣能忍辱又能耐痛，而且還有點「幽默」意味，最能卜主人的歡心，添宴會的熱鬧。</p>
<p>凡我同胞，快快鍜鍊這兩種精神罷！</p>
<h3>讀「决瀾」畫展</h3>
<p>— 魏猛克</p>
<p>閱申報，見自由談的上端，赫然出現了一條「决瀾社畫展」的廣告，據說，决瀾社是一羣年輕的藝術學徒所組織的畫社。旣是年輕的，一定有新鮮的，前進的作品，自然應該去看看。</p>
<p>雙十節這一天眞太平，炮竹聲固然没有，連青天白日旗和紅的燈籠兒也絶少看見。在這樣的太平的佳節，是極應該出去風雅風雅的，看美術展覽會，那眞是再好也没有的事。</p>
<p>於是，午餐後，我和兩個朋友便上了霞飛路，一轉灣，就有一方横着街張起的竹布招告命令我們停住了脚，迎面是一所聳出雲表的高洋房，大門口一塊招牌道：「世界學院」。</p>
<p>走進大門就是禮堂，這禮堂的建築是頗新式的，但屬於那一派的新建築我却說不出。禮堂的門上雕有希奇古怪的圖案。牆壁的當中高懸一扁額，上面是吴稚老的家書，書法眞工整得與商店裏的廣告字差不遠，到底是名不虚傳，着實令我拜服。扁的旁邊，便是成羣結隊的鏡櫃了，我知道，這裏應該就是决瀾社畫展的會場。</p>
<p>於是我趕快看鏡櫃，看竟框裏面的傑作。</p>
<p>然而抱歉得很，這麽多的作品，我看得懂的眞少，｜陽太陽君的「菓物與烟突」，我就不懂蘋菓之類何以能擺在有烟突的屋頂上：丘堤君的「靜物」，也使我奇怪花瓶裏的花是綠有，而葉兒倒反是紅色；王濟遠君的「風騷」上的大紅大綠，我曾幾乎以爲是樹林子起了火；此外許多頭小腿胖的人體，又使我疑心中國的模物兒個個都是生了水腫病。···：：：：不過，其中有一張劉獅君的「構　」，却吸住了我的眼，使我留連過兩三分鐘，｜這是一張以沉悶而堅實的色調，利用木刻的線，來表現一個勞苦的貧民的家庭，也許結構不見得怎樣好，但貧民的飢寒的痛苦的神情，却完全被他描寫了出來，不但是誰也一看就懂，並且給人以感動，共鳴的力量。像這樣抓住了現實，爲大衆所熟悉的，自己的藝術品，在目前這烏烟瘴氣的中國藝術界，恐怕也並不多見。聽說劉獅君自從不幸開了一次個展，被名流們讚美一番以後，也常喜歡談派别，弄弄希奇古怪的玩竟兒，但他現在倘眞能夠覺悟而後返於現實，到勞苦的大衆生活裏去找藝</p>
<p>術的新生命，那他的前途未嘗不仍是光明的，我想。</p>
<p>出了世界學院，我覺得我的心有些空虚，但也歡喜，他們究竟都是年輕的一羣，我們年輕人的錯誤是常免不了的，倘他們肯降低他們所認爲藝術的水準，就終於會有新鮮的，前進的作品出來，像劉獅君的作品，便是很好的例子了。</p>
<h3>談「肓腸炎」</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>宋春舫論劇中有自著未來派劇本肓腸炎一種。言一病人就醫，醫士診斷爲肓腸炎，爲之介紹於某一有名之外科醫士，醫金可以略减，亦須四五千元。病人懷金去見外科醫士，行於荒野，忽遇一盜，刧其金不足，尚搠其小肚一刀。旣見外科醫士，醫士謂肓腸已割，由於盜刀，詫爲奇事。而病者反頌盜爲恩人，謂可省去四五千元寃枉錢，强盜入獄，法官宣判云：</p>
<p>「你並没有犯殺人的罪，但是你行醫却没有得到警廳的許可，罰你坐六個月的監牢」</p>
<p>宋先生謂未來派劇曲完全爲一種「没理由」之滑稽劇，自我　之，其所謂没理由，正自有其理由；看似滑稽，亦有其正經者在。即如宋先生此劇，凡曾患肓腸炎面經西醫割治，惡其索費甚昻者，眞有醫生　酷，過於强盜之感。至謂强盜一刀，恰恰割好肓腸，自是「没理由」之事。而法官判盜，不科其殺人越貨之罪，但責其行醫未嘗向警廳註册，判以半年徒刑，是誠滑天下之大稽也。</p>
<p>今年二月二十一日傍晚，予突患急性肓腸炎，初不自知。但覺腹痛如絞，嘔吐不止，因吸鴉片烟至醉，痛止而臥。次晨腹痛如故，益以全身作痛，輾轉反側，俱無是處。因託一友，去請張醫生。及醫生來視，時已下午，云須立即入醫院割治，遲則不救。乃同車而去，候醫於急症間，有外科醫生數人偕來診視，並剌血以騐。旋入病房，一醫生云，「診斷結果，確爲肓腸炎，惟已逾二十四小時，肓腸膿潰，開刀有待。」痛甚，則注射嗎啡一針。並不服藥，惟絶對禁食，飮水而已。如此者近旬日，熱漸減，痛亦漸止，始進流質柔軟之食物，再逾一旬，予即歸家療養矣。但據醫生事後語予，予病實至危險，倘因肓腸膿潰而成腹膜炎，是必不治也。今者予之肓腸炎雖若已愈，然欲根治，非開刀不可，醫生之言，宜若可信。</p>
<p>方予之腸病尚未瘥復也，予妻又以腸病入醫院開刀。彼因腸結不通，脹破流血，病勢極爲兇險。幸而開刀之後，經過良好，今兹已滿三月，康復有望，是誠不幸中之大幸也。</p>
<p>當予妻臥病醫院時，聞區克宣敎授以肓腸炎就診於倭醫，割治而死。友人樂嗣炳先生亦以肓腸炎開刀，病勢初甚危險，後幸痊愈。吁何腸病之險，而患者，之多耶！</p>
<h3>兩兄弟</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>「吁」！羅蘭老爹突然呌說。他好久以來一動都不曾動過，兩眼注視着水，有時候以一個很輕的動作，把那垂在海裏的釣竿舉起。</p>
<p>在船尾，坐在那被邀來一塊兒釣魚頑的陸醉米太太身旁假寐着的羅蘭媽媽，醒來了，轉過</p>
<p>頭對她的丈夫說：</p>
<p>「怎的！：：：怎的！：：：老爹！」</p>
<p>那暴怒着燥的老實漢子回答：</p>
<p>「再也没有一條魚來碰一碰釣了。從正午以來，我什麽都不曾釣到。我們以後應該祗和男子漢一塊釣魚；娘兒們老是使你出發得太遲。」</p>
<p>他的兩個兒子，筆爾和哲安，一個坐在船的左面，一個坐在船的右面，每人拿着一根捲好了的釣竿，這時不禁一齊笑起來。哲安對他的父親說：</p>
<p>「爸爸，你對於我們的客人太不客氣了。」</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹不好意思起來，道歉說：</p>
<p>「請你不要生氣，陸太太，我一向是這樣的。因爲我歡喜和太太們在一塊，所以把她們請來，隨後，等我覺得自己登在水上，我便把全副心思放在魚上了。」</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽這時完全醒清楚了，帶着一種感動的神情，瞧着岸壁和海的廣綿的邊際。她喃喃的說道：</p>
<p>「可是你已經釣得很不少呢。」</p>
<p>但她的丈夫搖頭表示不然，雖則他同時對那魚籃投着好意的一瞥｜三個男子捕獲的那些魚，還在籃子裏糢糊的跳動着，我們可以分辨出由那膠粘着的鱗，疲弱無力而勉强鼓起的翅，和那在致命的空氣裏的呵欠等，所成的一片温柔的聲響。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹把魚籃抓到兩膝之間，把牠傾側起來，使那一注銀子似的魚兒流到籃邊，以便瞧見籃底的那些，於是牠們那種垂死的悸動更加劇烈了，魚身的强烈的氣味，一種有益的海潮的腥氣，從滿滿的籃腹升起。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「打破紀錄」的感想</h3>
<p>— 從雲</p>
<p>全運會聲中，連珠砲似的只聽見「打破紀錄」，畢竟不弱啦！在這事事「落伍」的中國，突然發見這班生龍活虎的年青夥子，使出驚人成績，怎不呌人興奮一下子，至少也得逐漸消滅去這「東亞病夫」的雅號。</p>
<p>近年來，中國運動史進步之有此迅速的成績，一方面固係體育界之精神，運動員之努力；另一方面，則不得不歸功於敎育界提倡之積極，是故每個學校，每週間總得有「體育」這麽一二課，而於每年春秋之際，還要抽閒來舉行幾次上海中等學校運動會，自家學校裏的運動會，還有額外加入底「萬國運動會」，此外就是每天幾小時的練習。</p>
<p>話又說回來了，有了單純的體格，也不能代表整個救國方式的，可是「事實」似笑話般的告訴我們，一個大學生不能夠寫一封家信，（况若本刊月前某君所寫的「運動大家」一般的），這雖不單是指運動員，但運動員已被公認是其中的主要一部分，也許會有人奇怪，旣這麽，怎樣在大學裏生存呢？這原是一種特殊的畸形生活，他們存身在學校裏，非僅學費不須化得，衣飾費也不能用煩心，甚至雜用還要校方津貼，校方是痴嗎？還是利用他們，持他們而號召。無非還是社會上變形的競爭之一種，運動員可謂神通廣大矣！</p>
<p>因爲這般，是以堂堂學府内出來的，甚至游過洋邦勝境歸來，還是迷迷糊糊，研究化學理科的，公式都纒不清，怕甚？只要有面子，臂膊粗，還愁没位置麽？做上個甚麽長，甚麽科，所學的不合用，用上兩個秘書，好在自己只要有簽字的本領也就夠了。窮酸子呢？那只有挨着自己命運，找尋「出途」去了！</p>
<p>更進一步說，這回運動有這樣好紀錄，固然是提倡諸公之努力，吾希望諸公仍秉救國精神，作更進一步之努力，創造幾項其他新紀錄出來，路政的建設，行政的實施，工業的救濟，以及：：：這些都是我們急迫需要的，我希望一年有一年的成績，年年增加新的紀錄。</p>
<p>話雖這樣說，行者還自行之，但，總不要像「九一八」「一二八」時的「飛箭」「飛雷」「飛：：：」飛了滿天星還未飛出半個影子的樣子才好，吾希望當局諸先生撈出一把零錢來救濟他們一下子，這也是提倡呵！而且是眞正的救國，雖是殘酷殺人的戰具，但在這個野獸世界却需要着它的。</p>
<h3>象棋與麻雀</h3>
<p>— 亞珠</p>
<p>象棋是一種磨鍊心智的玩具。這種光明坦白的鬥爭，是、鬥智的高尚游戲，也可以作爲處世或改良社會的練習。</p>
<p>下象棋以殺敵之主帥爲目標。只要能達目的，因而苦心孤詣，曲折進攻，嚴密防守，或面對敵人重要份子而不殺，或自己受到絶大犧牲而不惜。一面固守，一面前進。或攻中寓守，或守中寓攻，或聲東擊西，或以退爲進。雖千變萬化，鬼計百出，然而皆是坦白的行爲，皆屬求達目的的舉動。所以玩象棋，可以養成一種有目的的奮鬥，一貫的精神，爲求達目的而犧牲一切的毅勇。</p>
<p>一個人在社會上做事，正如下象棋一樣。若有下象棋的一定目標，及犧牲奮鬥的精神，必能有所成就。</p>
<p>麻雀是暗中摸索的，牌是暗中堆就的，開圈是聽骰子擺佈的，除碰，食時可以利用自己的聰明經騐，有多少的斟酌外，大半是靠命運，即所謂牌風。牌風不好，憑你有多大的經騐，也是不中用的。所以打牌的人，多是靠運氣。勝負旣無法把握，也就樂得一任命運。因此在不知不覺中便會養成委靡不振，聽天由命的低下習性，而消失志向。狡黠者不受命運｜即牌風的支配，便施其鬼域伎倆，或調牌，或飛牌：：：：出其卑鄙的手段，更爲醜壞。</p>
<p>所以我以爲玩象棋比玩麻雀好得多</p>

<h3>Military Council Sends Personnel to Inspect Fang Ji's Remaining Troops; Those Willing to Stay Will Be Sent to Baoding for Training; All Routes of Government Troops Prepare for Complete Demobilization; Japanese Troops Stationed at Niulanshan Will Also Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the Military Council sent personnel, along with Li Jingrong, representative of Shang Zhen, to the Dongjiazhuang area to inspect Fang Ji's remaining troops. Before Fang Ji left, this unit had indeed numbered over 14,000 men with 3-4,000 rifles. However, after days of Japanese bombing, there were many desertions. It is still difficult to ascertain the exact number of remaining personnel. During the inspection, the authorities decided to issue each soldier five yuan, each officer ten yuan, each rifle twenty yuan, and each horse ten yuan. All rifles and horses will be temporarily handed over to the Military Council for safekeeping. After the inspection, those willing to continue serving in the National Army will be transferred to Baoding for training. After training is completed, they will be reorganized and issued rifles. In approximately three to five days, after this unit is transferred, all routes of government troops will be completely demobilized. This morning, a major staff officer from the Japanese army stationed in the Niulanshan area went to the headquarters of Commander Li of Shang's army to express contact and stated that after Fang's unit leaves, the Japanese army will completely return to Chengde to restore the peacetime situation within the non-militarized zone.

<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Tianjin, Fang Ji has not communicated with Ping Fang as of noon today. Fang Ji has decided to travel abroad. The request for a title and travel expenses from the central government has been telegraphed here. It seems difficult to obtain the title, but the travel expenses should not be a problem. At the very least, military authorities can provide private assistance. After surrendering their weapons, Fang Ji's unarmed troops are now heading to Donggezhuang and Luogezhuang, the garrison locations designated by the Military Council. They will be fully concentrated tonight. Those who wish to return to their hometowns will be sent back, and those who wish to remain in military service will be transferred to Baoding for training in the coming days. This unarmed force is temporarily led by Mi Wenhe, commander of Fang's unit. After training is completed, they will be issued rifles and formally organized. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang Ji's Whereabouts in Tianjin Unknown</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) It was generally expected that Fang Ji would not reside in the Japanese Concession after arriving in Tianjin. Therefore, the detectives of the British, French, and Italian Concessions were dispatched everywhere, but they were unable to ascertain Fang Ji's address. A reporter went to inquire at the Ji residence at No. 40 French Concession Road. The residence appeared deserted. Idlers said that they had only heard that Fang Ji had come to Tianjin, but he had definitely not arrived there. They also inquired with Lu Zhonglin, who also claimed to not know Fang Ji's whereabouts. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Recent Situation in Dolon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yao Jingchuan, the Baoding Garrison Commander of Chahar Province, came to Beiping to talk. Baoding is adjacent to Dolon, which is becoming the first line of national defense. Since the puppet army of Li Shouxin occupied Dolon, heavy taxes and levies have been imposed, and the people cannot bear it. Military and political power is controlled by a certain country. Songshishi Xiaoliang, the captain of the Japanese army's special service team stationed in Rehe, arrived in Dolon on the first of this month. After Song arrived in Dolon, De Wang continued to go. The so-called "Inner Mongolia Autonomy" is in full swing. De Wang's strength is only two or three thousand rifles previously given by the central government and 800 rifles of this flag, and the number of people is only one thousand nine hundred. Such strength is not a worry. Hu Wangfeng, a great bandit of Rehe, was introduced by a certain party. More than 2,000 cavalry bandits led from Kailu are stationed in Dolon to vote for De Wang. De Wang instills in general people a way of fooling the general people, saying that the reason why Mongolia must be a lama is purely a policy of Mongolization by the Han people. In order to make the Mongolians freedom, it is necessary to initiate Mongolians autonomy. The wording is ridiculous. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Atrocities in Manchuria: Slaughtering Seventy to Eighty of Our Compatriots</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese in Manchuria acted arbitrarily and killed our compatriots, which has become commonplace. However, due to the remoteness of the area, the separation of news, and the Japanese restrictions, newspapers were not allowed to publish inhuman atrocities, and thus were unknown to the outside world. According to the Manchester Guardian on August 30, the Japanese army massacred seventy to eighty Chinese on July 29, and the Japanese spies shot and killed our children. The details are as follows: on the morning of July 29, eighty-four prisoners were taken from the prison and sent to the suburbs to be executed in pre-built trenches. During the execution, five prisoners were in a row and the prisoners were divided into two batches. At 2:30 a.m., a group of vehicles lined up in a row, the first car carrying officers, the second soldiers, then the prisoner cars, and the last car containing two Japanese officers and one Russian detective. Forty-three prisoners, aged from eighteen to one, were all executed near the monument to Japanese soldiers who died in the Russo-Japanese War. Another batch was sent to Qingxi in the suburbs of Harbin. Among the eighty-four people in the two batches, seventy-two were Chinese. After the massacre, the Japanese authorities notified the newspapers not to publish it. Since then, there have been a large number of massacres, which will be carried out by more secret means. At the time of the massacre, a Chinese boy shouted "The Manchurian Country will be destroyed and the Japanese will die!" Someone wrote with red ink "Chinese should unite with the Soviet Union to drive out Japan." The words were deep and could not be destroyed. The Japanese will chisel the words away, and then use cement plastering. After the massacre, anti-Japanese "puppet" slogans were posted everywhere in Harbin. Two Chinese children, about ten years old, were walking and jumping, and were caught by Japanese spies. The spies shot them dead on the spot and fled. Since then, the Chinese have become more resentful. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3>Senior Civil Service Examinations to Be Held in the Coming Days; 2,639 Applicants from All Provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The second senior civil service examinations will be held in Beijing and Ping on the 20th. Of the fifteen and thirteen examination commissioners, they entered the examination area on the 16th. Xu Mo and Wu Dajun are still there because Xu is the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wu Dajun is the Director of the National Government's Statistics Bureau. They are too busy with government affairs to enter the examination area. After the preliminary examination, they will be able to continue to enter the examination area. There are 2,639 applicants from all provinces. In addition to a part of the examination in Ping, those in Beijing must go to the Examination Yuan from the 15th to the 19th to collect the admission certificate.

Many flowers have been planted. The building can accommodate more than 1,000 examiners. Some staff members of the examination committee have moved in. A pavilion was built in the field, offering a stone carving of Confucius asking for gifts, which Dai Chuanxian obtained when he entered Luoyang last year. It is from the first year of Yongming. Chairman Lin personally wrote the inscription to show his admiration. The exam is held twice. The exam categories are divided into finance, administration, education, administration, accounting personnel, statistics personnel, diplomats, consuls, judges, etc. In addition to the main test questions, there are also Chinese, Party Ideology, History, and Constitution.

The roll call time is from 7:00 am to 12:30 pm every day. Fearing that there would be cheating, in addition to the regulations that pens and ink documents should be brought into the examination room, any other items must be handed over to the storage area outside the gate of each examination commissioner's examination room. On the door of the examination room of each examination commissioner, there are red paper black letters and the two words "Guanfang" (official seal). Shen Shiyuan and Bai Pengfei, the examination commissioners of the Beijing examination hall, had already been in Beijing, and Tian Jiongjin and Gao Youtang, who were sent to Beiping as supervisors, left Beijing and went north on the morning of the 17th. After Gao Youtang and others arrive in Ping, they will hold an oath ceremony with Shen Bai, and they must enter the examination area and be isolated from the outside world. Return to Beijing one month later (17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The roll call list for the preliminary examination of ordinary administrative personnel from the 20th to the 22nd of this month has been released at the examination hall gate on the 17th.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>From Germany's Withdrawal from the League of Nations to the Japanese Political Situation　None</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, the German government resolutely announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. The European political situation was greatly shaken, and the Far Eastern relations felt especially tense. This unveiling of the mask of peace is the beginning of the market competition. Considering the overall situation, it is deeply lamentable. Tracing its origins, how can it be accidental?</p>
<p>Since the European War, Germany has suffered immense losses from territorial cessions and reparations. However, after more than ten years of vigorous management, it has seen through the contradictions of the European powers. Later, it used the principle of giving before taking to deal with the situation, and the national power gradually improved, the international status gradually increased, and the economic capacity gradually recovered. At that time, the victorious powers had to rebuild German capitalism and cultivate it, only to establish a shield against Russia and a tool for extracting reparations, but they did not expect it to become increasingly uncontrollable. Moreover, the day of Germany's economic recovery coincided with the world's overproduction. In the past three or four years, countries have been paying consistent attention to solving the panic. During this period, Germany first exhibited its payment of reparations in 1931, and then in July of this year exhibited all commercial debts, which was slightly relieved. Its rulers witnessed the development of economic nationalism among the powers, and they only had one way to save themselves urgently. Self-help must be carried out by both military and economic means, and national defense and public security must be advanced simultaneously. Catching up head-on has led to today's situation of confronting the powers.</p>
<p>Now, the British and French countries are ostensibly trying to prevent Germany's rearmament, but Germany's firm demands are only a pretext for self-defense. However, in my observation, the impact of this issue is far more than that.</p>
<p>From the European perspective, the current German authorities stated on the day they took office that they would tear up the Treaty of Versailles, recover colonies, fight for the Polish Corridor, and demand equality in armaments. Their hopes were very extravagant, but so far none have been realized. On the Geneva side, there was also a firm refusal. Therefore, it did not hesitate to withdraw from the League of Nations to anger its people. Furthermore, the Franco-German dispute is an indelible fact in European history, and its core lies in redrawing the map of Europe, and opinions are becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile. Now that Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it can freely expand its armaments. The complete breakdown of the foundation of peace is imminent, and only the arrival of the god of war remains.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Far East, Germany is one of the members that followed Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The Japanese military faction is naturally deeply pleased that they are not alone and feels that the expansion of armaments is inevitable. When the news of Germany's withdrawal was conveyed to Tokyo, Sadao Araki said, "Everything depends on the circumstances." The naval authorities said, "The disarmament conference in 1935 will have no results." As a result, the army and navy in the Five Ministers' Conference will become more and more eloquent, and the Far Eastern military panic will undoubtedly accelerate. The Japanese Five Ministers' Conference is known as a deliberation on the unity of national defense and diplomacy, but the conflict between its military and financial cliques is an undeniable fact. If this is the case, the financial clique will inevitably be sacrificed, and the military clique will brazenly reveal its mask, strengthening suppression internally and urgently engaging in aggression externally, which is also predictable. Germany's withdrawal from the alliance is only a harbinger of the panic in the Tokyo political situation.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The General Disarmament Committee has already replied to Germany's notice of withdrawal, and Germany has also indirectly replied, declaring that genuine disarmament work can still be carried out, but the new developments in Austria and Hungary have overthrown the hope of an early understanding. According to the current situation, the major powers and Germany will obviously have no urgent action. However, the news that Hungary will demand the revision of the Treaty of Trianon and the occurrence of serious disturbances in Austria have turned the optimism that occurred for a time today into nothingness.</p>
<p>After the General Disarmament Committee passed the reply to Germany drafted by Chairman Henderson, it adjourned until October 26, giving politicians from various countries the opportunity for private talks. Chairman Henderson declared that the work of negotiating a disarmament agreement must not be interfered with by other matters. Other countries should not stop their work simply because of Germany's withdrawal. When the committee adjourned, Henderson also said that he hoped that the representatives would return here, prepared to sign an arms agreement.</p>
<p>As soon as the Disarmament Committee adjourned, the German, British, and French ambassadors began private talks in Rome. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not participate in the ambassadors' talks. It is hoped that after an open exchange of views, a way to resolve the crisis can be introduced.</p>
<p>When the General Disarmament Committee voted on the reply to Germany, the representatives of Turkey, Russia, Hungary, and Poland abstained from voting and stated that they were not opposed to the document sent, but protested that the prior consultation had not consulted them. People in the League of Nations now believe that since there is such a rift in the international community, Hungary is prepared to take the opportunity to pressure the League of Nations to revise the Treaty of Trianon. Some representatives even believe that if Hungary makes such a request, it may split the small countries into two factions.</p>
<p>Since the General Disarmament Committee has adjourned, the League of Nations representatives are currently studying the situation in Austria. According to the fact that the major powers are unwilling to immediately allow the Germans to rearm, part of the reason is also to maintain complete freedom of action in Austria. According to news from Vienna, the National Socialist Party of Austria has resumed its demonstration actions. Students took the lead in causing trouble, causing the government to order the closure of universities across the country. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Government Expresses That It Will Not Interfere in European Politics　Cooperation Is Limited to Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Geneva) U.S. Representative Davis, following instructions from his government, issued a declaration stating that our arrival in Geneva is solely for the purpose of handling the disarmament issue. On the day when there is continued negotiation and hope of success on this issue, we are very happy to cooperate with various countries. However, we are particularly unwilling to participate in purely political events or matters purely related to the future of Europe. We now wish to reiterate that the United States has no political ties with any major European power. Any treaty in our minds is purely related to the issue of world disarmament. As for whether the continuation of current efforts is beneficial or not, this is a question that Europe should answer, and the United States is not in a position to answer on its behalf. Talks will be held between European capitals this week, and these talks are of a political nature. We do not wish to have active cooperation in this. The principles cited in President Roosevelt's letter to the heads of state in May of this year are still the basis of U.S. policy. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Prepared to Continue Discussions on Disarmament　Germany Sends a Note to the Italian Government</h3>
<p>Rome It is heard that Germany, in order to express its desire for peace, has sent a note to the Italian government, declaring that it is prepared to continue disarmament discussions outside the Geneva Conference. Its intention is clearly not to negotiate new terms, but to proceed along the path that the two countries have already taken. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government has decided to allow the European powers to decide for themselves whether efforts to complete disarmament should continue on a general scale. The United States will not participate in any meetings in Europe this week. It is now learned that the U.S. government earnestly hopes that the negotiations arising from the current events will not involve political disputes. Washington people now</p>
<p>feel that the like-minded unity of the past was entirely focused on the event of world disarmament, and the U.S. government should not be politically allied with any country in Europe. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, officials stated that the United States is still taking a wait-and-see policy on the Disarmament Conference, waiting for developments in the next few days, but the United States is prepared to assist in the progress of the entire disarmament plan. There are no new instructions for U.S. Representative Davis at the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini　Waits for an Opportunity to Mediate</h3>
<p>He has exchanged views with senior officials from various countries.</p>
<p>Rome The Italian government is still working to find a new basis for continuing disarmament negotiations and has exchanged views with ambassadors from various countries, but due to the complicated nature, there has been no news from official circles. It is believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must wait for foreign public opinion to gradually calm down and sympathize with Germany's actions before he can come forward to mediate. Italian newspapers are also making speeches advocating mediation. The Italian Daily said, "I firmly believe that the hope of retreat is not completely cut off, and all doors are not completely closed." (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome According to the results of today's and yesterday's talks with representatives of various countries in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may issue invitations in the near future, inviting the foreign ministers of the four-power pact signatory countries to hold a joint meeting here. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald　Studies Countermeasures　Closely Consults with Various European Countries</h3>
<p>(London) The British King's Secretary discussed the European political situation with Prime Minister MacDonald at No. 10 Downing Street for half an hour today. The British Prime Minister received reports from Foreign Secretary Simon in Geneva and all British embassies in Europe in his residence at any time. Lord President of the Council Baldwin also consulted with the Prime Minister. As for the cabinet meeting, it seems that it will still be held on Wednesday this week, when Foreign Secretary Simon can return to England from Geneva to participate. Today, all parties in political circles are advocating calmness. At the same time, some people believe that German Chancellor Hitler's speech still implies the reopening of negotiations, although it has been denied by Berlin, but it is said that Hitler's speech, although the path of negotiation is still not closed, but Germany cannot take the initiative. At present, the members of parliament who support French Prime Minister Daladier advocate that the Disarmament Conference should continue and draft a convention for various countries to sign, which will come into effect after Germany signs it in the future. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Among the British cabinet members who criticized Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain was the first. Chamberlain said in a speech in Nottingham today that Germany's actions were reckless and arbitrary, which is very regrettable. Chamberlain earnestly stated that the proposal put forward by Foreign Secretary Simon with the approval of the French, American, and Italian countries was aimed at allowing Germany to enjoy full equal treatment within a considerable period of time. He also said that the current situation requires very calm and prudent consideration to deal with it. It is not possible to make startling speculations and it is advisable to wait for Britain to consult with other countries on the implications of this unfortunate incident and decide on the course of action to be taken today before a judgment can be made. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Important members of the delegations of various countries, such as British Foreign Secretary Simon, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, etc., will return to their countries during the extended period of the Disarmament Conference to contact their governments on all matters. Foreign Secretary Simon may attend the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, when the recent developments of the Disarmament Conference will be discussed. Foreign Secretary Simon will meet with Prime Minister MacDonald after arriving in London. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The rumor that the German ambassador to Britain went to the British Foreign Office to detail the reasons for Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has now been proven untrue. It is said that a person who looked very similar to the German ambassador went to the Foreign Office today. Nearby photographers mistakenly thought it was the German ambassador, so they scrambled to take pictures. Although the doorman of the Foreign Office knew the face of the German ambassador, he almost mistakenly recognized him. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>The French Government Does Not Approve　Invoking the Four-Power Pact　Public Opinion is Calm and Solemn Towards Germany</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Disarmament Conference is extended without closing, which is the policy in accordance with the French government's proposal and firmly rejects unilateral talks with Germany. People in Paris are very satisfied with this. The French government does not approve of using the Four-Power Pact, saying that the agreement</p>
<p>can only operate within the framework of the League of Nations. The general public believes that since Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it has placed itself outside the scope of the agreement. People view Hitler's purpose as breaking the unity of Britain and France and lulling France into a state of sleep. Public opinion is particularly calm and solemn regarding Germany's withdrawal from Geneva. However, the stock exchange today saw a sharp drop in various domestic and foreign securities. The French cabinet has decided to meet tomorrow morning, and the parliament has also decided to reconvene in the afternoon. Prime Minister Daladier will attend the meeting to present France's policy towards Germany. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour arrived here this morning and attended the cabinet meeting. The cabinet meeting was held after 10:00, and the president personally presided over the meeting, listening to Paul-Boncour's report on the current situation in Geneva and passing the statement on Germany's actions that Prime Minister Daladier plans to make in the parliament this afternoon. One thing is particularly noteworthy: the Radical Party's newspaper Volonte publicly advocates direct negotiations with Germany, saying that this can avoid involving France's old allies and the Little Entente. Only Franco-German understanding can guarantee the security necessary for the economic recovery of Europe and the world. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During his weekend vacation, French Prime Minister Daladier made several phone calls to Geneva, having long talks with his colleagues, and having detailed discussions on the political and legal observations of the situation after Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. According to the political circles today, France's attitude thereafter is roughly as follows: (1) France is willing to continue discussions on the Disarmament Conference and can pre-commit to the Disarmament Convention; (2) Discussions on disarmament issues can only be conducted within the framework of the League of Nations organization; (3) The implementation of the currently proposed Disarmament Convention must wait until Germany signs it; (4) The completion of the treaty should be based on the British proposal; (5) Inter-consultations between Germany and France are out of the question, because France must maintain the interests of its allies such as Poland and the Little Entente; (6) If you want to open negotiations with Germany within the scope of the Four-Power Pact, you must wait for Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. In addition, the government newspaper Le Petit Parisien praises the friendship between Britain and France as the cornerstone of French policy and hopes that a real alliance can be established between the two countries. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Beneš Opposes　Negotiations Outside Geneva</h3>
<p>Give Germany time to understand the overall situation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference, Czech Chief Representative Dr. Beneš, told a Reuters reporter today that it is impossible for the powers to negotiate a disarmament convention. The convention must be made in Geneva. Beneš also said that the best way now is to give Germany time to recognize the true facts of the overall situation and eliminate the thought of complete isolation. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister's Talk　Recognizes That the Situation is Hopeful　Takes a Calm Attitude Towards Germany's Actions</h3>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kanya have already started together for the Bulgarian capital and then to Turkey. Before his departure, Gömbös made a speech, saying that Hungary took a calm attitude towards Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference. We believe that there is hope in the tone of the Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson's reply and the repeated peace declarations made by the German government. The "strategy" of dividing nations into first-class and second-class is not what we agree with. All countries "should seek a sincere solution to the situation in equality of rights and security." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Neurath　Reiterates Germany's Position　Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Overthrow of the British Plan</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Neurath explained Germany's position to foreign journalists today, saying that "What we are most disappointed and surprised about is that the basis for disarmament negotiations no longer exists, because the British plan previously passed by the whole no longer exists. Even the initiators of this plan do not recognize it and want to greatly change it. The key to the current situation is the distinction between the victorious and defeated countries, or the question of whether the principle of recognizing Germany as a member of the international community and enjoying equal rights should be allowed to exist permanently. The powers' intentional discrimination against Germany destroys the basic concept of the League of Nations. In terms of armaments, France has more heavy artillery than German machine guns, and France has more machine guns than German rifles. The disparity in the amount is such that Germany agreed to the British plan and agreed to the Disarmament Convention for a period of five years, but opposed the trial period and advocated immediate equality. Germany may be prepared to immediately change its national defense army into a short-term service army, but can only state what kind of weapons Germany needs when it knows what kind of weapons other countries want to have. As for what British Foreign Secretary Simon said in Geneva that Germany's attitude is more rigid than before and demands more than before, it is not true." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Words of the German Ex-Emperor　Praises Hitler's Actions　His Return to the Country is Really Not a Problem</h3>
<p>Amsterdam The German ex-emperor praised Hitler's move to sever relations with the League of Nations Disarmament Conference when talking to people today, saying that it is very strange that Germany has been a member of the League of Nations for so long. Although Germany sincerely joined the League of Nations, it has always been treated unfairly, which is very regrettable. The ex-emperor also said that his return to the country is really not a problem. He knows that Hitler currently has other things in planning and has not yet had time to deal with the restoration. The restoration is not included in the agenda of the National Socialist Party. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Neurath told a Reuters reporter today that Germany does not want to reply to Henderson's letter criticizing Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference. If Henderson and others think that Germany's reasons are not sufficient, I can only listen to it. We have announced our reasons. It is found that Henderson's reply was sent to Germany after being passed by the core department, stating that the German government has adopted a very strict decision, and the reasons on which it is based are those that he cannot consider sufficient, because Germany took this step at a time when the core meeting had already decided to submit the disarmament plan and appropriate safeguards for the realization of equal rights to the General Committee.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany's actions are very regrettable and cannot be understood. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Disarmament is Temporarily Adjourned　Quietly Observe the Evolution of the Situation　Representatives of Various Countries Leave Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference met today, and the venue was crowded. Chairman Henderson reported in silence that British Foreign Secretary Simon explained the plan to the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference on Saturday, saying that this plan is a useful basis for the Disarmament Convention, but due to Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, the situation has changed, so the Presidium only asked the General Committee to file this plan and immediately read the German document of withdrawal on Saturday and the draft reply to Germany by the Disarmament Conference. There was applause when reading the draft reply, but the Hungarian representative said that the position of the country on the issue of disarmament was special and that the country's representative could not agree to the proposed reply to Germany. The Soviet representative also made a reservation, but said that the Soviet Union's reservation was due to the fact that the draft reply involved a plan that had not been solicited by the Soviet Union and could not be considered as the Soviet Union's approval of Germany's attitude. Representatives from Poland and Turkey also joined the declaration of the Soviet representative. Chairman Henderson showed impatience when he heard the opinions expressed by the representatives and suddenly said that since there was no objection to the draft reply, it would be sent to Berlin today and then discuss the future of the Disarmament Conference. In his view, the Disarmament Conference still had to go through various difficulties if it wanted to establish a Disarmament Convention, but the decisions that would be taken later would have serious consequences. Henderson also proposed to reconvene the General Committee on the 26th of this month. This proposal was passed without discussion. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, British Foreign Secretary Simon, Foreign Secretary Eden, Italian Representative Surania, and Polish Foreign Minister Beck all returned to their countries tonight, but U.S. Representative Davis is still staying here. The Disarmament Conference is now holding steady and does not want to make any expression to Germany and has decided to reduce activities within ten days to wait for the evolution of the situation. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At 3:00 this afternoon, the Core Committee of the Disarmament Conference held a closed meeting. The German representative was absent, but Soviet representative Dovgalevsky attended for the first time. The chairman of the committee, Henderson, immediately submitted to the committee a reply to Germany's document of withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference on October 14. Henderson further explained that Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference was just when the conference had already decided to have the Shanghai Committee find a way to make a concise plan to make the issue of equality, which Germany had repeatedly cited as a premise, a reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany's actions are very regrettable and cannot be understood. At 4:00 in the afternoon, the General Committee reconvened, which was the last meeting of the General Committee in this session, so all countries were represented by extremely important personnel. Chairman Henderson reiterated that the three points in the document of German Foreign Minister Neurath were worthy of discussion and had to be answered in detail. The three points were approximately (1) that the Disarmament Conference could never achieve a general reduction of armaments, (2) that it was very clear that the powers had no sincerity in practice regarding the responsibility for arms reduction, and (3) that the hope of realizing the principle of equality of armaments demanded by Germany would never be realized. Henderson said that these three points had been answered in detail in the reply, and the reply was cheerfully passed by the representatives of various countries. The representatives of various countries then each made speeches, and Henderson said that Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference was just when the Core Committee was about to complete its work. As for whether the meeting will continue thereafter, Henderson supports continuing the meeting. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Journalists　Insult the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>(Geneva) A German journalist representing the newspapers of the National Socialist Party publicly insulted Henderson, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, in front of the Disarmament Conference venue this morning. The journalist parked his car in the parking space designated for the chairman of the Disarmament Conference. The police asked him to leave, but the journalist ignored it. Henderson personally asked him to politely, but the journalist answered in a very rude manner, saying that he was not subject to his orders and that there was no Disarmament Conference now, so of course there was no chairman of the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Henderson　Directly States the Key to Peace and War　Disarmament Must Proceed Even If Germany Withdraws</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson made a broadcast speech here tonight, saying that the choice we should have now is peace or war, gradual disarmament out of world action, or a crazy competition of mutually increasing offensive and defensive weapons, or falling into a barbaric state with the experience of new-style war terror and cruelty. Those who died and were injured in the Great War and the solemn responsibility are added to mankind and require it to continue its efforts to prevent the world from re-entering the darkness of another great war, so the struggle for disarmament must proceed, and the League of Nations Covenant must be respected and not regarded as waste paper. Those who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield hoped that there would never be war again. How can we betray the dead? Even if Germany withdraws, the Disarmament Conference must produce a real convention. No matter what reasons the saboteurs hold to destroy the law, we cannot allow the world's laws and order to be destroyed by international lawlessness. If the people of the world cooperate unanimously based on maintaining the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Pact, we can ultimately establish disarmament and guarantee peace, but if we allow the treaty to become a dead letter, what we get is not disarmament, but another war. Therefore, the responsibility we bear is extremely important. We should watch to see that the collective peace system based on the League of Nations is not destroyed by people. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>US-Russia Resumption of Relations Would Prevent Soviet Russia’s Isolation; Red Army Concentrates in Northwestern Siberia; Japan-Russia Relations Increasingly Strained</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since the disputes along the East Road between Japan and Russia have seen serious developments, Soviet Russia has begun to reinforce its Far Eastern defenses. Soviet Russian troops are currently concentrating in Siberia, and its air force is also gradually moving eastward. Large quantities of military supplies are also being concentrated there. There are even rumors that some of the Red Army reserve soldiers in eastern Siberia have been mobilized, but this cannot be definitively confirmed here. Observers here, in view of the escalating tensions in Japan-Russia relations, believe that the resumption of relations between the United States and Russia has become an exceptionally critical move. Soviet Russian leaders are deeply convinced that American recognition of Soviet Russia would effectively prevent the anti-Russian adventurism of Japanese militarists. Washington is now in a position to prevent war in the Far East and it is believed that the U.S. State Department is also paying attention to this. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Newspapers View Europe as a Volcano; World Peace in Danger</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian newspapers, commenting on Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, all say that world peace is now in danger. For example, an article in *Pravda* stated that Germany is now confronting a united front of the United States, France, and Britain, and that Europe has become a volcano. The entire capitalist world is now preparing for war. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Strengthening Naval Power; Combined Fleet Reorganization Advanced; Threat to the Western Pacific</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In preparation for emergencies, the Japanese Combined Fleet for the Showa 9th year [1934], is planning to reorganize its fleet in mid-November, half a month earlier than usual. The battleships Mutsu and Kongo will be withdrawn from the front line to conserve their strength, and will be replaced by the refitted Haruna. The aircraft carriers Hosho and Kaga will be withdrawn, and replaced by the new, cutting-edge aircraft carriers Ryujo and Akagi to stand on the front line. Furthermore, the First Torpedo Squadron, which has always been formed by the Third Destroyer Division, will now be formed by the Fourth Destroyer Division. This is an emergency-time arrangement that is intended to greatly enrich the fleet’s content. As a result, the prestige of the Japanese fleet will be further enhanced, and it will be able to put pressure on the Western Pacific. (17th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hirota's Basic Diplomatic Policy Aims to Win Without War; Relying on Full Military Strength as Backup; Induce China to Be Friendly, Resolve Pending Issues with Russia; Improve Political and Economic Relations with the United States and Britain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, Japanese cabinet leaders gathered to discuss the basic national policies regarding diplomacy, national defense, and finance. Foreign Minister Hirota stated his diplomatic policies, divided into the following four points: (1) Peaceful diplomacy must have sufficient national defense as a backup in order to be effectively implemented, but the main goal is to win without war. (2) The objectives of Japanese diplomatic policy are to deal with the United States, Russia, China, and Britain. The first three are Japan's neighbors, and the last one has close economic ties with Japan. The main purpose of Japanese diplomacy is to enhance friendly relations with these four countries. (3) In order to implement the above policies, Japan should immediately resolve outstanding issues with these countries, such as the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It should also seek harmony among the people of the countries concerned. On this point, there should be some political proposals, such as the proposal to establish an arbitration treaty between the United States and Japan. (4) A peaceful policy does not mean surrendering to foreign countries. Japan is prepared to take practical and independent plans to deal with events that cannot be handled by ordinary diplomatic methods, because China and Russia often despise international faith and engage in propaganda and intimidation. Considering this, sufficient national defense is absolutely necessary. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Five-Minister Conference in Japan: Military Faction and Financial Clique Oppose Each Other; Saito Yields to the Military; Striving for Compromise; National Policy Budget to Be Reviewed Separately</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The five-minister conference, which has been the focus of domestic and foreign attention, has been held for four consecutive sessions. The free discussions of each minister on the previously proposed reorganization of national defense, diplomacy, and finance have also been quite detailed. Although efforts were made at the sixteenth's meeting to reach a comprehensive conclusion, the military and the diplomatic and financial authorities were still in a state of opposition and could not be reconciled. Forcibly summarizing things to one point would only intensify the internal conflicts within the cabinet, and even the fate of the cabinet could be greatly affected. Therefore, the government, in view of this, carefully considered and decided to conclude temporarily the fifth meeting on the twentieth, without forcibly reaching a decision. The fifth meeting would be considered fruitful by expressing unreserved opinions on various issues, and would be adjourned. As for the military expenditure in next year's budget and the outline of national defense policy, the specific details will be decided separately. These issues will be brought to the surface at the budget meeting after the Grand Military Exercise. (17th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the *Tokyo Newspaper*, although the government publicized that the opinions of the military and financial sides were close at the fourth five-minister conference held yesterday, they are still in conflict. Prime Minister Saito is extremely worried about his future. If he does not find a way to remedy the situation soon, the fate of the cabinet is in great danger. The Seiyukai is plotting to overthrow the cabinet from behind, and the military is also planning to seize power. Because of the conflict at the five-minister conference, foreign countries are also expecting a political struggle within Japan, which will cause unexpected internal changes. This atmosphere is very unfavorable to Japan diplomatically. If a vote is used to decide national policy in order to resolve the situation quickly, the military will turn against the government and seize power. Prime Minister Saito is now in a dilemma. According to someone close to Prime Minister Saito, Prime Minister Saito will ask Finance Minister Takahashi to recognize the principles advocated by Army Minister Araki, that national policy and the budget should be discussed completely separately, and that this year's budget should accept the military's demands as much as possible in order to seek compromise. If the five-minister conference still has no results on the twentieth, it will be temporarily adjourned and brought up again at the cabinet budget meeting. Furthermore, according to political circles, the military may not agree with Prime Minister Saito's strategy, and the dispute at the budget cabinet meeting will be more intense, and the political situation will definitely not be stable. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Araki Strongly Advocates Establishing National Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At yesterday's five-minister conference, after Foreign Minister Hirota opened by stating important views on diplomacy, Army Minister Araki said that it is imperative to establish foreign policies such as diplomacy and national defense. At the same time, domestic problems, such as the relief of farmers, fishermen, mountain villages, small and medium-sized businesses, labor problems, ideological problems, and education problems, must also be addressed. He strongly argued for the need to establish countermeasures for domestic problems. Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi replied that domestic problems need to have the relevant ministers involved, and cannot be decided by the five-minister conference, and requested that they be discussed on other occasions. Army Minister Araki agreed, and requested that Horikiri Kancho handle all the formalities. After the five-minister conference adjourned, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters that the world overestimates the five-minister conference, and the atmosphere of the conference is not so urgent. The budget needs to be compiled separately from the five-minister conference. If the results of the five-minister conference are not reflected in the budget, it will be enough to add additional budget items. Furthermore, Navy Minister Osumi told reporters that he has explained the Navy's position in detail, and the meeting on the twentieth may be largely finalized. Otherwise, the discussion will continue after the Army's Grand Maneuvers. The content is all major national issues, so all ministers are holding a very cautious attitude. (17th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Naval Treaty Issue Comes to an End; Prime Minister Persuades Wakatsuki to End the Conflict</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Baron Wakatsuki, president of the Minseito party, declared the truth about the London Naval Treaty, the military's conflict with the political parties seems to be intensifying again. Young naval officers will once again form a team to demonstrate. Prime Minister Saito, fearing that unexpected results will occur and cause a shake-up in the political situation, entrusted Baron Wakatsuki to end the conflict. The Minseito party also wants to take the overall situation into consideration and decided not to bring up the matter again. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>India-Japan Trade Conference Makes No Progress; Meeting to Be Moved to Delhi</h3>
<p>Simla. The Indo-Japanese commercial conference here has not yet achieved</p>
<p>any substantive agreement, and is expected to adjourn in a few days and reopen in Delhi. Both India and Japan appear to be impatient with the slow progress of the conference. As the Indo-Japanese commercial treaty is due to expire on November 10, and the new Indian cotton will soon appear on the market, the Indian representatives are also eager to reach some agreement before the opening of the special meeting of the Indian Congress on November 13. Therefore, they hope to determine the direction of the conference here, and then move the details to Delhi for discussion. The representatives of both sides will meet again today after the meeting, and if possible, will hold another meeting on the 20th, and then adjourn temporarily on the 21st.

<h3>Guerrilla Army in Jilin Active, Japanese Army Weary from Running About; Hirose Division Departs for Changchun</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Since August, the guerrilla army in Jilin has been appearing and disappearing unpredictably, causing the Japanese army to be weary from running about. The Kwantung Army has decided to send a large force to suppress them. Lieutenant General Hirose, commander of the 10th Division, has been ordered to the front lines to supervise the battle. Today at 1:00 p.m., he left Changchun for Jilin. A major battle between the guerrillas and the Japanese army is imminent. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Siam: Revolutionary Army Gaining Momentum; Tang Mao Ang Once Occupied; Subsequently Recaptured by Government Forces</h3>
<p>Singapore Today, early in the morning, news from Bangkok reported that the sound of cannons had been heard in the Siamese capital, and that the revolutionary army and government forces were engaged in fierce battles. It was reported that several people had been killed or injured. Previous reports said that the navy had occupied the arsenal, and the government forces had only offered slight resistance. The navy had previously submitted to the revolutionary army. Considering the weak defense of the arsenal, it is evident that the army will soon follow the navy's lead. Furthermore, it was reported that the revolutionary army has occupied Phetchaburi. At present, the revolutionary army's power is increasing day by day, and the number of people joining them is also increasing. (17th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Bangkok Siam. The government today has offered a large reward to capture the leaders of the revolutionary army, including the Minister of Defense, Prince Tayeb. The list of wanted people is almost like a Siamese telephone directory. Upon hearing the news, the revolutionary army issued a statement, demanding that the government resign and that the armed forces be completely separated from the government. Word has it that troops stationed about 100 miles south of the capital have defected and joined the revolutionary army. There are government patrols on the southern waterways. All Siamese ships have stopped sailing, but foreign ships are allowed to move freely without being harassed. Foreigners in Bangkok have withdrawn from the north, but order is still maintained.

<h3>Chiang Orders All Subordinates to Protect Virtuous and Upright Gentry</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang previously issued regulations on punishing local tyrants and evil gentry in order to pacify the people during the bandit suppression period, because the local tyrants and evil gentry were oppressing the people everywhere.

Now, in order to protect the virtuous and upright gentry, he specially ordered the provincial governments to instruct all counties that in the future, when punishing local tyrants and evil gentry, they must not be abused without confirmed evidence.

<h3>Japanese and Russian War Machines Increasingly Close, Japanese Army Actively Transporting Military Supplies in Shenyang, Soviet Russia Compiling Ten Divisions for War Preparation</h3>
<p>The situation between Japan and Russia is becoming increasingly tense. Reports have been received that:</p>
<p>The military deployments of both sides are very active. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Along the Amur River, upstream of Heihe at a distance of 40 kilometers from Biera Town, across from Heihe, and near Aihun downstream of Heihe, the Soviet Russian army is erecting barbed wire fences and converting all nearby transportation facilities for military use.</p>
<p>2.  The Soviet Russian authorities, recognizing the importance of military affairs, are actively completing the double-track railway in the Trans-Baikal region. Construction began on September 1st and will be completed in November.</p>
<p>3.  Slavsky, the Soviet Russian Consul-General stationed in Harbin, suddenly went to Fularji on September 16th. His actions are noteworthy. At the same time, the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Rudyi, is preparing to go to Khabarovsk. It is said that he has received orders to report to Minsk.</p>
<p>4.  The atmosphere in northern Manchuria is unusually tense. The Japanese army recently transported a large batch of military supplies from the Shenyang Arsenal within four days (September 23rd) as follows: (A) Weapons: twelve 77mm field guns, three 150mm guns, twenty-four small-caliber mortars, two medium-caliber anti-aircraft/flat-trajectory/low-trajectory triple-purpose guns (the latest type of artillery), eighteen Type 92 small-caliber guns with upper, middle, and lower three purposes, one hundred and thirty-four Type 91 and Type 38 automatic rifles, sixteen anti-aircraft machine guns, seven anti-aircraft guns (medium-caliber, vehicle-towed), three 1.5-meter-caliber (direct-face) searchlights, eleven sound detectors, forty-five aerial obstacle devices (balloon type); (B) Ammunition: fourteen No. N demolition boxes for engineers, more than thirty boxes of signal flares and sparks for communication teams, thirteen flame throwers, two trainloads of shells, totaling 840,000 pounds, with an average weight of 30 pounds for each large, medium, and small caliber shell, which means there can be 95,300 rounds. Small rifle bullets (including machine gun bullets) amount to about 800,000 rounds; (C) Vehicles: three heavy tanks, thirteen light and fast tanks, eight armored vehicles, sixteen 1.5-ton trucks, two special vehicles for the army communication team (chassis with axle lever cable pulleys and application items), thirty-six shell vehicles; (D) Gas masks: five hundred and sixty boxes of gas masks, the quantity in each box is unknown.</p>
<p>5.  Recently, Soviet Russia reorganized its Far Eastern military equipment into ten divisions under wartime configuration, and deployed more than 20 heavy bombers in Khorvat-Wo on the northern Manchurian border (east of Suifenhe). Other important locations have also been deployed. The activity range of this air force includes important cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Changchun, and Fengtian. Furthermore, twelve submarines are deployed in Vladivostok, which means the shipping route from Rajin to Japan is completely blocked. Although the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is pro-Soviet Russia, there is nothing he can do about Soviet Russia's efforts to strengthen its military equipment.</p>
<p>6.  After inspecting the Russian military activities in Hulunbuir, Koiso, the chief of staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, stated in his published remarks that Russia does have military preparations, and that they are now transporting more than 280,000 European and Western troops to the Far East.</p>

Japanese naval and army officers, consuls, deputy consuls, representatives of the civilian corps, and industrial, commercial, and overseas Chinese stood on the riverbank to welcome him. That evening, Japanese Naval Commander Sakano, Army Attaché Tajiri, Consul General Shimizu, and Administrative Chairman of the Japanese Residents Group Iikawa boarded the Tenryu to pay their respects and report in detail on the deployment of the naval and army forces upstream, the administration of the Japanese concession, and the recent situation of industry and commerce.

It was decided that he would still take the Tenryu warship back to Shanghai on the 17th. The ships upstream in Yichang and Shashi were unable to come to Hankou for inspection due to the shallow water, so Yamamoto sent Major General Shimada to fly to Yichang and Shashi to represent him.

<h3>He Chengjun's Assassination Attempt in Sichuan: Two Assassins Captured on the Spot; Returns to Hankou with Illness, Postponing Trip to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Hankou correspondence: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, was ordered to enter Sichuan on the 27th of last month and returned to Hankou on the 12th of this month. He originally intended to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek within a few days, but was unable to do so due to illness. He was once assassinated and once encountered danger during his trip to Sichuan. Chen Guangzu, the director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, recently spoke about the details: "This time, Liu Xiang took office, and Director He represented the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to oversee the oath, and instructed the Sichuan generals on the strategy of curbing the bandits. The mission was important, so it was noticed by general reactionaries and communist elements. When traveling from Chongqing to Chengdu by car, it was rainy and the mud was knee-deep, making it difficult for the car to travel. One day in the afternoon, when traveling dozens of miles from Chengdu, two cars came to greet him. Director He and others were tired from the long journey and needed lunch, so they asked the welcoming car to go ahead, and continued to drive west in the original car. Before Director He's car arrived, the welcoming car had already arrived at Niushikou Station. Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Luo Zezhou, Li Qixiang, and other generals mistakenly thought that Director He had arrived, and rushed forward to greet him. At that time, two people suddenly approached from nearby amidst the welcoming sounds, behaving suspiciously. They were pushed down and captured by the guard troops on the spot. Each person had two bombs hidden on their body. After interrogation, they confessed that the purpose of the assassination was to kill all the generals, including Director He, when he arrived, causing chaos throughout Sichuan. Fortunately, the guard troops were deployed strictly and discovered them earlier, so the tragedy did not occur. After Director He finished his official duties in Chengdu, he returned to Chongqing by car in the rain on the morning of the 7th. On the afternoon of the 8th, when traveling to Lao Yingyan Mountain, about dozens of miles west of Chongqing, the mountain road was rugged and the car was difficult to travel. The engine was constantly overheating. When they reached the highest point of Lao Yingyan, they stopped the car to add cold water. Because the car brake was not tightly closed, the car body suddenly retreated sharply. The driver was unable to rescue it and panicked, and the car was backing up as if flying. The car was being ridden by both Director He and Division Commander Wang Lingji, and they both intended to jump out of the car, but it was difficult to jump out. Fortunately, there were several wooden stakes at the dangerous part of the cliff. Although many were broken, one stake still held the car, allowing them to escape danger. Otherwise, there would have been a thousand-foot cliff, and no one would have survived. Director He's trip to Sichuan lasted half a month and he encountered danger twice. The assassination attempt was indeed carried out by the Communist Party or reactionaries. The accident was due to the car brake not being tightly closed, and the parking place was on a cliff. After Director He returned to Hankou, he originally intended to go to Jiangxi immediately to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the situation in Sichuan, but because he was exposed to wind and cold along the way, he became ill as soon as he arrived in Hankou, so it is still difficult to go for the time being," he said.

<h3>Zhang Cuizhenhua's Accusation Case: Yi Peiji Files Counter-Suit, Accusing Zhang and Cui of Colluding to Sell; Appeals to All Levels of Government</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Cuizhenhua accusing Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, it is learned that Mr. Yi yesterday submitted a complaint to the Central Supervisory Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Justice, accusing Zhang Cuizhenhua and Zheng Lie, the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, of colluding to commit fraud. The original text is disclosed as follows:</p>
<h3>Document from the Standing Committee of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>Submitted concerning Zhang Cui Zhenhua and Chief Prosecutor Zheng Lie of the Supreme Court, and others, who, under the guise of the authority of judicial independence, colluded and bribed witnesses, deliberately framing individuals. Since the Supreme Court is the highest judicial body, appealing to it would undoubtedly be futile. Therefore, we beseech your council to uphold justice and prevent unjust grievances.</p>
<p>The origin of this matter: on May 1st of this year, Chief Prosecutor Zhu Shusheng of the Supreme Court suddenly arrived at the academy to investigate the entire case of accounting and disposal of goods. Pei-ji believed that a court investigation into any improprieties was perfectly reasonable. If an official had overlooked something, it could be detected through this process. Consequently, he instructed the officer in charge of the files and the relevant staff to submit the entire file for review. However, the prosecutor abruptly sealed the files. The next day, he came to the academy and gathered officials of all ranks to interrogate them, creating a situation of unusual gravity. When asked who had filed the accusation, the prosecutor replied that a highly influential person had initiated the action and wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yin Qiwen, a clerk from the academy who was also being questioned, suddenly left his seat and retrieved two folded goods dispatch notices from the disposal documents, claiming that they were proof that the president and secretary-general had purchased furs on non-public sale days. Prosecutor Zhu asked Yin whether the goods were ordered before the price was set. Yin replied that this was definitely not the case and that he would vouch for it with his integrity. At the time, the academy's secretary-general, Li Zongdong, the director of the general affairs department, Yu Xingchu, the secretary, Wu Ying, and the clerk Huang of the Supreme Court were all present and heard the statement. The record taker was clerk Wu. However, when the minutes were reviewed the next day, the phrase "this was definitely not the case, and I would vouch for it with my integrity" had been changed to "I am not sure about that." When asked why the original words were not recorded, Zhu and clerk Huang both stated that Yin did say those words. However, the records of the previous day were taken by clerk Wu of the court, and Yin had already signed them. Since Wu was not present, it was inconvenient to make changes. If Yin provided a letter of explanation, it could be attached to the file.</p>
<p>Pei-ji summoned Yin, but he did not appear. He then asked secretary Wu Ying to instruct clerk Chen Zhong to find Yin. Chen's search for Yin was unsuccessful. The next day, he went to Wu's residence, where he said that Yin was unwilling to write the letter. Chen also said that he and many others had heard Yin boast that he had been sent to Nanjing by Mrs. Zhang to attend a meeting at the Zhongshan Forest residential area, where they discussed first removing Pei-ji from his post through the disciplinary committee and then investigating him. Since the disciplinary committee could not do anything, they changed their approach to restricting and investigating him through the judiciary. Many important people were present at the meeting, including Zheng Lie and Zhu Shusheng. Yin also said that Zhu came to Beiping and they met every day and that he treated Zhu to lamb hot pot. Pei-ji was speechless when he heard this.</p>
<p>Later, after an investigation, a friend in Beijing sent a copy of a wireless telegram, which read: (1) "Geng Telegram" contains the line, "Can be transferred to the local Beiping prosecutor's office for handling, but the investigation of the superiors is urgent. Xiao Yun Geng." In the Pei-ji case, the "transferred to the local Beiping prosecutor's office" refers to Zhu's arrival in Beiping to inspect the accounting documents. There were several hundred yuan worth of receipts, many of which had been rewritten. Accounting personnel claimed that this was done to comply with the auditing law. The original receipts had consecutive years, months, or subjects, and had to be split up. This was a common result of enforcing the auditing law, and it was common for the audit department to reject them and order new ones to be issued. In a report responding to the impeachment by Control Yuan member Zhou Lisheng, which was publicly released, Pei-ji also mentioned the so-called "private creation of accounts" by former accounting section clerk Qin Hanggong. Preparing financial statements is normal accounting practice. If there were any fraudulent or inflated situations, then evidence should be presented. This time, it was merely said that the receipts did not match the store's accounts, but the actual amounts of money were not carefully verified. So, what had been combined was split, and what matched in reality did not match in name. The store could clarify this. Moreover, Zheng was well aware that if there was any wrongdoing, a special investigator would be responsible. Pei-ji's offense was at most negligence, and the amount was so small that it was impossible to implicate higher officials in a joint crime. The phrase "the investigation of the superiors is urgent" meant that they wanted to find a way to collude and pursue criminal charges against superiors. The intent to humiliate Pei-ji was obvious. (2) "Jia Telegram" contains the line, "There is no resistance in this case. Li's crime is serious and should be arrested immediately." In the Pei-ji case, it is strange that judges use whether or not there is resistance as a standard for handling a case. The reason why there was "no resistance" was because Zhang Cui Zhenhua initiated the case. Zhenhua is the wife of Central Committee member Zhang Ji. She had hated Zhang because of an incident. She transferred her anger to Zhang, who borrowed a rare annotated copy of the Water Classic Commentary by the great scholar Wang Guowei from the Beiping Library. She burned public property. Another example is Sun Yue, the brother of the former Governor of Hebei, borrowed a car but did not return it for years. When asked to return it, it was auctioned off in front of Zhongshan Park in Beiping, allegedly to raise funds for a lottery. These kinds of things are too numerous to count and were witnessed by all, but no one could do anything about them. Therefore, Zheng Lie used this to embolden his prosecutor to proceed freely. Zheng Lie was introduced to Zhang Ji by Cui Zhenhua and became the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court. He dared not disobey the orders of his teacher's wife. The statement that "Li's crime is serious" refers to Li's purchase of furs on a non-public sale day. There was no explicit regulation about public or non-public sale days. The location and procedures for selling goods were the same. Legally, there was no such thing as a public or non-public sale day. Moreover, foreign ambassadors and people from all walks of life in this country came to purchase goods on non-weekdays almost every day. The academy was raising funds for the public, so it was advantageous to sell more. There was no reason to refuse customers. According to his statement, he did not purchase any furs, but his wife may have done so. No law deprives an employee of the right to purchase goods, let alone his wife. Yin Qiwen himself filled out the dispatch notice, clearly marking the date as December 27, 1931, which was a Sunday, a public sale day. However, Prosecutor Zhu wrote on the back of the notice, "Request to view two dispatch notices from the Palace Museum for December 27, 1932 (photographs of the notices are attached). December 27, 1932, is naturally not a Sunday and therefore not a public sale day." He did not realize that December 27, 1932, was a year away from the time of the sale. A prosecutor's inspection of a case is so arbitrary and distorted, turning right and wrong upside down in order to incriminate someone. It is both appalling and ridiculous.</p>
<p>It seems that later, they realized their mistake and fabricated evidence, claiming it was written by Li, with the words "delivered to the president" to prove that Pei-ji, as the head of the academy, had purchased goods. Regardless of whether he purchased goods or not, the president had not been deprived of this right. Furthermore, according to Li, the handwriting on the evidence did not match his handwriting at all and was obviously forged. Moreover, this type of phrase, "delivered to the president," is illogical. The procedures for public sales were similar to buying goods at a department store in Shanghai, but even more stringent. First, the buyer would select the items and report their numbers. Then, the seller would issue a dispatch notice and notify the accounting office. The buyer would pay at the accounting office and receive the goods. At the same time, a release order would be sent to the gate guard. The buyer would take the goods to the gate, where the gate guard would check the items against the release order to ensure there were no discrepancies before releasing them. Prosecutor Zhu has already re-verified the dispatch notices and release orders, claiming that they match (see attached photographs). Therefore, since the buyer carried the goods out and they were released, why would they need to be delivered to the president? Even if we imagine that the president had prohibited purchases, and someone else bought them on his behalf, they could be delivered to the president after they were released. Why would they write a note and give others an excuse? The forgery is not only laughable but also extremely absurd. It is unknown how the so-called "serious crime" is serious and how it is significant. Perhaps the "serious crime" is taken from Cui Zhenhua's public accusation in the newspaper, which stated that on July 17, 1931, a non-public sale day, she purchased goods and had a release order as proof. Where is the release order for July 17th? If the release order from December 27th, a public sale day, which Yin Qiwen revealed several months later, is used for both purposes, even if Cui is a woman who is completely unreasonable, she should still laugh. Perhaps what she posted in the newspaper also said that she was invited inside and saw Mrs. Yi Pei-ji and Mrs. Li Zongdong selecting leather goods in the board of directors' room. When Zhang arrived, they were all shocked and embarrassed. This revealed the fact that they were violating their duties and attempting to benefit themselves. Li reportedly said, "Aunt, don't be angry. What do you need? Feel free to choose." It is laughable to determine whether someone is violating their duties and attempting to benefit themselves based on their facial expressions, which is akin to astrology and has no value in distinguishing anything. According to Li, he inspected the arrangement of the goods at the sales location on non-public sale days due to his job responsibilities. This was something he should have done regularly. Cui entered, but they had already left. How could she have seen them selecting leather goods? This is delusional. When Cui entered, she said loudly, "Zheng Yuxiu is welcome, but I am not allowed to enter. What is the reason?" Her words were incoherent, her manner was fierce, and she was extremely laughable and difficult to appease. She described them as shocked and embarrassed, which may have been similar. The statement "Aunt, don't be angry. What do you need? Feel free to choose" was also said after everyone had calmed down because Cui had stated in the newspaper that important people and foreign ambassadors could also purchase goods on non-public sale days. She was the wife of a Central Committee member and was, of course, an important person. If she wanted to buy goods, of course, she would be invited to choose them. This statement was often made to other buyers. However, I have always referred to her as Mrs. Zhang and never as Aunt. (Note) On that day, Cui went outside the Shenwu Gate. The gate guard suspected that Cui was a visitor and asked for a ticket, resulting in a small conflict. When Cui entered, she was still angry, so Li said to her, "Mrs. Zhang, don't worry. I will scold them." In the end, Cui did not buy anything, and no one bought anything. Moreover, I recall that this day was in early winter and that I was wearing heavy cotton clothes, definitely not July 17th. It was actually November 23rd. Cui's random nonsense cannot be inferred by reason. It was a month away from the public sale day on December 27th when the leather goods were purchased. If she had not foreseen it, how could she have involved it as a violation of duty and an attempt to benefit oneself on that day? It is truly ridiculous. As for my wife, she had been living in Shanghai and only came to Beiping on April 8, 1932, which everyone knows. How could Cui Zhenhua have seen her buying furs at the Palace Museum a year earlier? This proves that everything else is an interpolation and fabrication by Zheng, Zhu, Cui, and others. This example proves the rest.</p>
<p>Also, a telegram was sent from Beiping, notifying the left side. The text read: "Jia Telegram is on hold. Immediately investigate whether antiques have been stopped from transportation and ask the Executive Yuan to order that transportation not be stopped due to the case. Zhang instructs Yin to come immediately. Funds should be prepared in advance. Has Cheng been released on bail? Please reply by telegram. Lie Steam."</p>
<p>In the Pei-ji case, the statement "Jia Telegram is on hold" refers to the fact that Li's crime was serious and he should have been arrested immediately. Now, they are ordering a delay in the arrest. It is unknown what resistance was encountered that led to the delay. The chief prosecutor changes his mind according to the situation and is unworthy of his high position. It is pitiful. Also, Zheng Lie sent a letter to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao newspaper to defend this telegram. Judicial independence means that prosecutors have the authority to weigh all actions. Why would he defend himself to a newspaper? This shows that he is guilty and confused and has completely lost the attitude of a judge. Judges can prohibit commentary on inappropriate evaluations of cases, but he says, "Your newspaper's principles are pure and its arguments are fair." He describes the situation in detail and asks for inspection so that everyone can see it. The use of the word "please" is disrespectful. Furthermore, he says that it is difficult to publicize the case before the investigation is concluded, yet he also says that he is briefly describing the situation for inspection. There are so many contradictions in just a few lines. In the end, this telegram exposed the truth, so he inevitably felt guilty and timid and his wording was incoherent. He defended himself, saying, "As for the statement that the Supreme Prosecutor's Office directed the prosecutors in Beiping to investigate matters outside the scope of the investigation." This case was originally inquired about by this office based on information from A, and B is one of the witnesses he cited. On May 10th, this office received a report from A stating that he had recently heard that someone sent someone to ask B to write a letter stating that the defendant did not reduce the price or detain items. Please pay attention to this matter. This office believed that a flexible response was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. Therefore, on the same day (the day of the steam telegram), based on A's request, the prosecutor in Beiping was ordered to have B come immediately to avoid hesitation due to concerns. From the perspective of the prosecutor, this action was not only not illegal but also necessary." According to the above defense, there is one important point that he did not answer. The newspaper commented that the Supreme Prosecutor's Office directed the prosecutors in Beiping to investigate matters outside the scope of the investigation, referring to whether antiques had been stopped from transportation and asking the Executive Yuan to order that transportation not be stopped due to the case. This was indeed influenced by the Ministry of Justice. But what is judicial independence? If the administration can seize the freedom of the judiciary, it is naturally concerned with the pleasure and anger of superiors, fearing that it will be detrimental to its position and lose its status as a judge. Therefore, he could not answer a single word. As for the defense of Zhang's instruction for Yin to come immediately and to prepare funds in advance, regardless of whether it is true or not, even if it is considered true, it is tantamount to exposing the true fact that he bribed. Pei-ji and the lawyers he knows deduced from the side that it was even more accurate. The so-called A refers to Zhang, which is also Cui Zhenhua. The so-called B refers to Yin Qiwen. According to Cui, someone sent someone to ask Yin to write a letter stating that the defendant did not reduce the price or detain items. Please pay attention to this matter. This office believed that a flexible response was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. Just this paragraph means that Yin was bribed. They were afraid that he would be bribed away. Therefore, they had no choice but to use a flexible response. How could they use it? On the same day (the day of the steam telegram), based on A's request, the prosecutor in Beiping was ordered to have Yin come immediately to avoid hesitation due to concerns. This means that only Mrs. Zhang gave money and promised benefits. Yin was willing to abandon the low price and accept the high price, and came immediately. Moreover, he prepared a sum of money that Zheng, Zhu, and Zhang had agreed to at the meeting in Nanjing the other day to pay, so that he would come without any worries. If the telegram only said to instruct Yin to come immediately and that travel expenses would be provided, from Pei-ji's point of view, it would seem that this action was not only not illegal but also necessary from the perspective of the prosecutor. However, he was afraid that Yin would suspect that the prosecutor was instructing him to come, that Zhang was no longer involved, and that the travel expenses provided would not be worth mentioning, and that the funds prepared would not be able to alleviate his concerns. In this way, Yin's concerns were alleviated, but it was difficult to say that the prosecutor's actions were not illegal, and it seemed too necessary. Therefore, some legal experts said that the funds prepared refer to travel expenses. May I ask whether courts have ever had this kind of procedure in which a chief prosecutor prepares travel expenses for witnesses on behalf of an informant or complainant? The word "funds" encompasses a wide range. If it is travel expenses, why not say so explicitly? Moreover, Yin is just a small clerk at the Palace Museum. If he is instructed to go to Beijing, it would only be a small amount of travel expenses. Why use the word "prepare"? It is known that the funds that Zheng Lie instructed Prosecutor Zhu to prepare were the rewards that Yin and Cui Zhenhua had agreed upon in Beijing. I don't know when the conditions set at the time were paid. Now there is a need to instruct him not to be taken advantage of and to go to Beijing immediately. Therefore, Prosecutor Zhu was ordered to prepare the funds in advance in Beiping, and someone would return them later. It seems that Zheng Lie's defense is the same as what a certain legal expert predicted. He wanted to prevent him from hesitating and delaying his trip, which is truly the finishing touch, a personal confession of bribery.</p>
<p>From the rewriting of Yin Qiwen's records, it was known that Yin was summoned to Beijing, Cui Zhenhua convened a meeting, and then there was the telegram urgently investigating his superiors, and then this case had no resistance, the crime was serious, and he should be arrested immediately, and then Zhang instructed Yin to come immediately, and funds were prepared in advance. Although what I knew was not as detailed as what I have mentioned now, I knew that the net had already been cast. If he went to court, there would be no escape. When Zhu Shusheng came to Beiping, it was a time of crisis in Beiping. It was rumored that the other side was going to unexpectedly arrest Pei-ji and Li Zongdong and imprison them, waiting for the enemy to arrive. The Jia Telegram proves that this was not without basis. (Later, I received a letter from Palace Museum staff members Dong Lin and Zhang Zhe, reporting on a conversation with Yin Qiwen, and a letter from Qin Hanggong confessing his feelings, which proved that Zheng Lie's telegrams were clear as a finger. All the original letters from Dong, Zhang, and Qin are attached.) Therefore, going to court would result in torture and humiliation and would even sacrifice his life. However, Zhang Ji has always been a gentleman, so why would his wife resort to such a vicious plan? After much deliberation, it was difficult to understand. I had no choice but to recount the above-mentioned events and ask the board of directors for fair relief at the meeting. However, the chairman of the board accepted the petition and consulted with a few directors, who all believed that the truth could not be revealed. However, Zhang Ji was an important figure in the party and the country, and it would be embarrassing. Moreover, exposing the darkness of judicial independence would cause foreigners to laugh. On that day, Zhang Ji nominated Ma Heng as the president of the academy, and it was clear what the cause of the obstruction was. He believed that his plan had been successful and that he would slowly torment him. Therefore, he decided to request the board of directors to investigate and make a fair judgment. However, they still refused to allow the board of directors to interfere with judicial independence and prevented the board of directors from sending people to investigate. Even if they investigated, they knew that the evidence sealed by the court would not be turned over, and witnesses such as Yin Qiwen would not be summoned. On the one hand, they issued subpoenas, posted notices, and filed lawsuits, using all the weapons of the judiciary, and Beiping and Beijing were pressing forward. On the other hand, they used news policies, stealing treasures and embezzling funds, claiming them as private property, and sending people to plead for them. All of this was fabricated and was slanderous in every way. If everything was not described in detail, simply clarifying it would only cause society to ridicule it and pay no attention to it. I see that an arrest warrant will be issued, and I will be put to death. I previously questioned lawyer Jiang Yong about the funds prepared and asked the Ministry of Justice what the funds were for. Vice Minister Shi of the Ministry of Justice simply replied that according to Zheng Lie, they were travel expenses because he knew that Zheng Lie had deceived even the officials. Therefore, the Supreme Court is the main instigator, and the Ministry of Justice, which manages the prosecutor's office, has also been deceived. Where can I file a counterclaim? Rather than going through the district court, the high court, and the Supreme Court, suffering a hundred deaths and still not being able to redeem myself, I should first appeal to the supreme supervisory body at the risk of my life and ask your council for justice. I request that the government temporarily remove Zheng Lie from his post so that he can confront Cui Zhenhua in the district court. Pei-ji will immediately comply with the summons and appear in court. Pei-ji also knows that there are many fair people in the legal profession who can understand the purpose of the Control Yuan's supervision and conduct a fair trial. However, if Zheng Lie remains the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, all prosecutors will be afraid of being harmed by him, and prosecutors will find it difficult to file fair lawsuits. Respectfully submitted to the Central Supervisory Committee. (To be continued)</p>

More details will be reported later.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Deliberations on National Goods Promotion Week</p>
<p>The County Executive Committee convened representatives from various agencies and schools in the city on the afternoon of the 17th to hold a meeting to prepare for National Goods Promotion Week. Li Chang, Chairman of the County Executive Committee, presided over the meeting to discuss methods for promoting National Goods Week. It was resolved that: (1) The opening ceremony of National Goods Promotion Week will be held on the morning of October 30th, followed by an entertainment program in the afternoon. Starting from the second day, a National Goods Exhibition will be held at the Public Education Center, hosted by the County Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations. A special issue of National Goods Promotion Week will be compiled and printed, hosted by the County Party Headquarters, and newspapers will be notified to publish as much information as possible about the promotion of National Goods.</p>
<p>Two Kidnappers Identified by Victim</p>
<p>Fei Gongxia, an officer in the county's Water Patrol Team, previously apprehended a suspect named Wu Zixiang in the case of the murder of a Mr. Xi from Huayang Bridge. He obtained a lead and also captured a kidnapper named Shen Bingsheng, and rescued two kidnap victims, Chen Xianjiang and Zheng Boxiang. The county government has transferred the case to the court for review. The kidnapping portion of the case has been prosecuted. Both Wu and Shen vehemently denied the charges. The court summoned the kidnap victims to the court for identification. The criminal court opened on the afternoon of the 17th, and Wu Zixiang and Shen Bingsheng were brought to court. Kidnap victim Chen Xianjiang identified Shen Bingsheng as the person who delivered food in the kidnappers' lair, and Wu Zixiang as the person who was responsible for guarding the victims. The suspects' cunning denials may be in vain.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Large Quantity of Anti-Japanese Cloth Seized</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county, according to the revised regulations on eliminating anti-Japanese goods promulgated by the province, stipulated that all anti-Japanese goods within the county should be cleared by the end of September of this year. However, recently, various unscrupulous merchants in the market who sell anti-Japanese goods have been secretly active. Therefore, the association has been actively carrying out inspection work. According to reports from the past two days, two cloth stores in Beitang, Xie Da Sen and De Mao Sen, were still secretly selling anti-Japanese goods. Therefore, the association dispatched all the inspectors to conduct a thorough and strict inspection. They seized three pieces of cloth in Xie Da Sen in Beitang, one of which had a Japanese trademark, which confirmed that it was anti-Japanese goods. Later, they seized 19 pieces of anti-Japanese cloth from De Mao Sen at the China Steamship Bureau, and 84 pieces of anti-Japanese cloth from Shen Zhonghua's (owner of De Mao Sen) house at No. 5 Zhou Shi Lane. All of them had Japanese trademarks from companies such as Neiwai Cotton Factory and the Four Gentlemen. They were all taken to the association for storage and sealed, pending review and handling by the association.</p>
<h3>Truth Revealed in the Murder Case in Wu Jiang Lane</h3>
<p>Zhang Renjin, son of Zhang Longfu, a villager from Houtang Bridge in the Sixth District of the First Precinct, was suddenly beaten to death in the Dawei Lane area of the 595th district of the same precinct on the evening of the 11th of this month. His body was moved to the side of the railway in Wu Jiang Lane in the 596th district, and the ward head, Shao Leji, reported the incident to the police. The incident has been recorded in this newspaper. Why Renjin was beaten to death remains a mystery. It is now known that Renjin was walking through Da Zhu Lane on that day, and it was almost dusk. Dogs were barking everywhere. At that time, the daughter of Zhu Quangen, a local resident in the lane, was ill and was boiling medicine. When Quangen heard the barking of dogs, he opened the door and went outside. He saw Renjin walking and accused him of being a thief without asking why, grabbing him. He shouted, "Catch the thief!" His brother, Zhu Quanshi, and more than ten neighbors, including Zhu Xianghe and Lu Atu, came out upon hearing the cry and punched and kicked Renjin to the ground. They tied him with hemp rope, hung him up high, and beat him severely. Then they put him down, made him lie face down, and placed five large stones weighing about 300 pounds on his back. Zhu Quanshi stepped on the stones and jumped three times. Although Renjin begged for mercy, he was not spared and died tragically. Afterwards, they moved his body to the side of the railway. The county court and prosecutor's office have also obtained these clues and are trying to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Three Students in County Suddenly Strike</h3>
<p>Since becoming the principal of the County Third Elementary School, Wu Boming has not been effective in his work. Yesterday morning, the school held its routine memorial week assembly. The principal was giving a report, but before half an hour had passed, all the students suddenly scattered, gathered on the playground, and went on strike. The reason for the incident was the school's "excursion" problem, which had been put on hold. The nearby private Tingbi Elementary School had already held its excursion last week, but Principal Wu did not mention it. Therefore, the school took this action. The matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Changzhou 夜行航船迭遭盜刦</h3>
<p>A passenger boat traveling from Wuyi via the city to Weicun, which departed from the Bamboo Basket Lane outside the West Gate the night before last, was sailing near Lianjiang Bridge when suddenly five bandits, each armed with a handgun, jumped aboard. They robbed all the food on the ship and the passengers' hidden foreign currency, taking everything. Additionally, a ferryboat belonging to Hezhuang, owned by Xue Fengbin, was sailing near Luoshu Bay in the Dongwan area when it was also robbed, suffering greater losses of goods and cash than the Weicun ferryboat. After the incident, the boat owner rushed to report it to the Shipping Association, which in turn submitted it to the county government on the 16th, requesting a strict search for the stolen goods and arrest of the thieves to ensure safe navigation.</p>
<h3>Changshu 中委戴愧生來常游歷</h3>
<p>Dai Kui-sheng, Central Executive Committee member and Standing Committee member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, along with Wang Binyan, former Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander and current head of the Shanghai North District Security Corps, Xu Chunrong, Standing Director of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and the Tao brothers, Zijing and Zizhang, a total of nine people, arrived in Changshu on the 16th evening via a Kunshan ferryboat to visit the scenic Yushan Mountain. They were received by Yin Peng, Dai's old friend and the current head of the local Public Security Bureau, who hosted a welcoming banquet at the Hongyun Lou. They stayed at the Hongyun Lou that night. The next day, accompanied by Yin and others, they went to the northern suburbs to visit ancient temples such as Xingfu Temple and the Three Peaks.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou 綢布業仍反對大盛營業</h3>
<p>In Yangzhou, the silk, cloth, Western clothing, Gu embroidery, and ready-to-wear industries are still opposing the business operations of Dasheng Silk Company. After the county mediation decision, Dasheng opened today (the 16th), and business is unusually prosperous, causing disorder. The Public Security Bureau dispatched dozens of police officers to maintain order. At the same time, the six industries also resumed operations to maintain the mediation meeting and the authority of the government. However, the silk and cloth industries have not resumed operations. Labor is unwilling to return to work and is determined to fight Dasheng to the death. They are permitted to petition Dasheng again tomorrow morning (the 17th) and request the assistance of the 31 industries to unanimously support them. They will send a written notice to Dasheng, strictly prohibiting its operation, and announce a hunger strike until their goal is achieved. Currently, the party and government authorities are unable to persuade them, and they plan to seek instructions from the provincial authorities. At the same time, the special commissioner of the Provincial Party Headquarters, fearing incidents due to the intense situation, returned to the province to report on the handling process and seek instructions.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Takes Ship to Nanjing Yesterday Morning to Discuss Central Finance and Other Important Matters; Cruiser "Liu De" Expected to Arrive at Xiaguan at 10 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen came to Shanghai the previous time to plan finance and handle important matters such as the National Economic Committee. With Song's active efforts, most things have been settled. The Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Committee was announced in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Other control committees such as grain, silk, and mining will also be organized as soon as possible to start work early. Now, the plan to reorganize central finance, which was formulated during the meeting between Wang and Chiang in Lushan, needs to be discussed by Song after returning to Nanjing. Also, matters concerning the convening of a plenary session of the National Economic Committee and the organizational methods and candidates for various control committees all need to be discussed and carried out with the two Standing Committee members, Wang and Sun. Therefore, Song, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, and his residence guards, departed from Qiqi Road at 8:30 AM yesterday, went to the Jianghai Customs Wharf, and took the Jianghai Customs small steamer "Jinghui" across the river. At around 9:00 AM, he boarded the cruiser "Liuxing" on the Huangpu River at the Huishan Wharf and set off for Nanjing. The ship is scheduled to arrive at the Jiangmian River surface of Xiaguan at 10:00 AM today (the 18th). Song's departure was extremely secretive, so besides his apprentice Zi Liang, Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Hai'an, Hu Yunzhuang of the banking industry, Yang Zixiong of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and others who came to see him off, very few people knew about it, it is said.</p>

According to Liu's statement to reporters, he plans to rest briefly in Shanghai before proceeding to Nanjing to request instructions and then go to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang. As for the date of his departure for Germany to take up his new post, he roughly intends to take the Italian steamer "Motofan No. 1" departing from Shanghai on the 14th of next month, but the ticket has not yet been purchased, so he cannot be completely sure for the time being. He does not know whether Zhang Naiyan, the Minister to Belgium, will travel with him because he has not yet met him. Zhang Xinhai, the Minister to Spain, will travel with him. As for the selection of the secretary of the German Embassy, it is still pending announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>Zeng Zhongming Discusses Results of Wang-Chiang Meeting; Exchanged Opinions on Central Finance and Diplomatic Issues; No Decision Made</h3>
<p>Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, and Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, accompanied President Wang by plane from Nanjing to Jiangxi the day before yesterday to discuss important issues such as central finance and diplomacy with Chairman Chiang.

According to Mr. Zeng, Chairman Chiang is actively progressing in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and has no time to come to Nanjing for the time being. However, important issues such as central finance and diplomacy cannot be resolved without urgent consideration. Therefore, he invited President Wang to Jiangxi to discuss everything in person with Chairman Chiang. Although there was a detailed discussion on central finance and diplomacy, only opinions were exchanged, and no concrete decisions were made. Regarding how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure for central finance, Wang and Chiang have discussed a plan, but it still needs to be discussed with Minister Song before it can be completely decided. As for the finance of North China, it has been reduced to the predetermined level.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Line of China National Aviation Corporation Starts Regular Scheduled Flights; Carries Mail First; Two Flights Each Week, North and South</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation has been preparing to open the Shanghai-Guangdong air route. It has been several months since the successful test flight. Because the American shareholders did not fully agree with our side on the economic distribution issues of the line, it has been repeatedly delayed. It was not until the beginning of this month that it was completely resolved. It has been decided to officially open the route next Tuesday (the 24th), stopping at Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. There will be two flights each week, north and south, carrying mail first.

<h3>Chen Wenlin Continues Scheduled Flights to South China; Overhaul of Aircraft Completed; Test Flight Yesterday Was Excellent; Three Aircraft Fly Water Line After Conversion to Seaplanes in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Aviation Office of the Xiamen Naval Department, recently flew the Jiangque aircraft, which was built by the Naval Department, from Shanghai to North China with the Mechanical Section Chief Pan Dingxin, creating a grand feat of flying around the country. The North China section has been completed and he returned to Shanghai a few days ago. The overhaul of the engine has also been completed. A test flight was conducted yesterday, and the results were excellent. It is now scheduled to begin flying to South China on the 20th. The route will fly from Hangzhou to Fujian, then to Guangdong and Guangxi, and then to Shanghai, where it will be converted into a seaplane and join the Jiangfeng and Jiangou aircraft to fly a water line, so as to encourage public aviation concepts and promote domestically produced aircraft. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overhaul of Aircraft After the Jiangque aircraft flew from Xiamen to Shanghai, it was modified with a new motor from the British Far East Company to increase its speed, increasing the horsepower by 25. After flying from North China back to Shanghai this time, a new engine from the Far East Company arrived in Shanghai, so the Jiangque was again modified with an engine. Because the domestic parts were mostly replaced during the last motor modification, this time it only took two days and has been completed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Test Flight After the new engine was installed, Chen Wenlin, accompanied by Mechanical Section Chief Pan Dingxin, piloted the aircraft from Hongqiao Airport for a test flight at 11:30 AM yesterday. He flew around the city over the High Chang Temple Naval Headquarters Aircraft Manufacturing Office and Zhabei for an hour and then landed at the original location. The results were quite good.</p>
<p>Continued Flights to South China Mr. Chen received an order from the Naval Department to pilot a domestically made aircraft to fly around the country. The route is divided into two parts: North China and South China. The North China route has been completed a few days ago. It is now scheduled to take off from Hongqiao Airport at 11:00 AM on the 20th, accompanied by Pan Dingxin, to continue the mission of flying the South China part. It is scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou on the same day and stay overnight. On the 21st, take off from Hangzhou and arrive in Fuzhou via Ningbo and Wenzhou. On the 22nd, fly from Fuzhou to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Inspection in Xiamen Mr. Chen is scheduled to stay in Xiamen for two weeks. Because Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan has dispatched First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang to inspect the naval department's fleets, forts, and agencies, the Aviation Office, which is directly under the Naval Department, is preparing to be inspected by Commander Chen in Xiamen before continuing the flights to South China.</p>
<p>Continued Flight Route Take off from Xiamen and arrive in Guangzhou via Shantou and Hong Kong. Then fly to Wuzhou and Liuzhou in Guangxi Province to complete the national flight, and then fly back to Xiamen along the original route. Modify the seaplane and then fly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Water Line Flight After the seaplane is modified, the domestically made naval aircraft Jiangfeng and Jiangou will be united to fly a water line along the coast of the country and the Yangtze River, thoroughly awakening the public's impression of domestically made aircraft, it is said.</p>
<h3>Two Important Japanese Figures Arrive in Shanghai; Sugimura and Tokugawa Arrive Together</h3>
<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch from the China United News Agency on the 17th, Japanese Foreign Ministry Special Envoy Sugimura Yotaro and Japanese Minister to Canada Tokugawa Iemasa arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM today on the Fengtian Maru. Members of the Japanese Legation, the military attaché stationed in Shanghai, the consulate, and other government and civilian representatives all went to the dock to greet them. Sugimura immediately had a secret conversation with Minister Arima about the situation in North China and described the contents of his meeting with key military and political figures in North China to serve as a reference for Arima to go north and begin negotiations. Minister Sugimura will stay in Shanghai for two or three days before going to Nanjing to meet with key figures on our side. Sugimura once served as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations Secretariat and is very familiar with Lachsman. After withdrawing from the League, he was ordered to return home. This time, he was ordered by former Foreign Minister Uchida to come to China to conduct diplomatic guerrilla work, it is said.</p>
<h3>Private Travel</h3>
<p>Sugimura, upon arriving in Shanghai, gave a statement to the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency, saying that this trip was purely for travel purposes and was not made on an official mission from the Japanese government. During his time in Pingjin, he met with Chairman He Yingqin of the Military Council and Chairman Huang Fu of the Political Affairs Committee, among others, and was impressed by them. He was particularly impressed by his meeting with Chairman Han Fuju in Jinan, as he felt that Han was able to integrate the feelings of the Chinese and Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Plans to Visit Wang and Chiang</h3>
<p>He will not stay in Shanghai for long and plans to enter Nanjing in the next few days to meet with Foreign Minister Wang (Jingwei) and Finance Minister Song (Ziwen), etc. He will wait for the Japanese Embassy to contact the Chinese government before he can confirm. He is also preparing to fly to Hankou after arriving in Nanjing, and then transfer to Xunyang to meet with Chairman Chiang. He will stay in Shanghai for a few days when he returns to Shanghai and then go to Guangdong. Because China's territory is too vast, this trip will take two and a half months.</p>
<h3>Sugimura's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Mr. Sugimura was born in September of Meiji 17 (1884). In Meiji 41 (1908), he graduated from the Department of Political Science of the Faculty of Law at Tokyo Imperial University. He passed the examination for consul and diplomat that year and was appointed consul, serving in Lyon. He has since served as Third Secretary of the Embassy, Second Secretary, Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Counselor of the Embassy, First Secretary of the Embassy, and Director of the Japanese Secretariat of the League of Nations. In the Republic of China 16 (1927), he was transferred to Deputy Secretary-General of the Council of the League of Nations. Since April of this year, after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, he resigned and returned to his country, serving as a special envoy plenipotentiary without portfolio.</p>
<h3>Arima's Reception</h3>
<p>After the two envoys arrived in Shanghai, they stayed at the Astor House Hotel on the Outer White Bridge. Last night, they attended Arima's banquet at his home for dinner. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Government has scheduled a dinner party on the 19th to host the two envoys in order to fulfill the duties of the host and emphasize diplomatic etiquette.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company One Year Under State Operation; Supervisory Directors Replaced Yesterday; Ministry of Communications Sends Navigation Affairs Director to Shanghai to Supervise; Ten Supervisory Directors Replaced in the First Year; Gao Tingzi Talks About the Retrospective of the Past Year</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been managed by the Ministry of Communications for domestic and foreign shipping under state operation for almost a year. Yesterday was the expiration of the first year of the supervisory directors' term, so a lottery was held at the company to replace ten supervisory directors, including Lu Jianquan. The Ministry sent Navigation Affairs Director Gao Tingzi to Shanghai to supervise. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Supervisory Directors After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recovered its commercial shares last year and was changed to state operation, it established a supervisory board, a board of directors, and a general manager's office. The supervisory board is responsible for impeaching employees who have neglected their duties and auditing budgets and new debts. The board of directors is responsible for the business direction, the cancellation and revision of contracts, the clearing of claims, and the preparation of budgets. In addition to the general manager, who was appointed by the Ministry of Communications Liu Hongsheng, the supervisory board selected Lu Xuepu, Chen Huide, Yu Hede, Hu Mengjia, Qin Runqing, Huang Jinrong, Rong Zongjing, Jin Tingsun, Guo Shun, and others as supervisors. The board of directors selected Ye Zhuotang, Shi Liangcai, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Gongquan, Yang Zhixiong, Du Yuesheng (above are standing directors), Hu Bijiang, Li Fusun, Qian Yongming, Yu Rizhang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Lulin, Hu Yunzhuang, Sheng Pingchen, Huang Jiangquan, and other sixteen people as directors.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations The replacement of supervisory directors by the company yesterday was stipulated by its organization. Article 5 of Chapter 2 of the Supervisory Board stipulates that supervisors shall be selected and appointed by the Minister of Communications for a term of two years and may be reappointed upon expiration. Four supervisors in the first term shall have a term of one year, as determined by drawing lots. Article 20 of Chapter 3 of the Board of Directors stipulates that directors of the board of directors shall have a term of three years and may be reappointed upon expiration. In the first term, six directors shall have a term of one year, six directors shall have a term of two years, and the rest shall have a term of three years, all as determined by drawing lots. This limitation led to yesterday's lottery.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation Yesterday, it was decided to hold a lottery, and the Ministry sent Navigation Affairs Director Gao Tingzi to supervise. At 2:00 PM, it was held in the company. The supervisory board was originally located on the third floor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the board of directors was located downstairs, so the supervisors were drawn first, and then the directors. Those who attended included Lu Jianquan, Li Fusun, Ye Zhuotang, Liu Hongsheng, and others. After performing the rituals, the supervisors were drawn by Lu Jianquan, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and the directors were drawn by each person. Those who did not attend were drawn by representatives. As a result, a total of ten people were drawn in the first year. The supervisory board and the board of directors were established on November 14th last year, and it will be one year soon. As for the replacement candidates, it must be reported to the Ministry of Communications by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Ministry of Communications will select and decide, and then the Executive Yuan will approve before a decision can be made. Therefore, yesterday, those who were replaced or reappointed were not yet known.</p>
<p>Lottery Results Yesterday's lottery was for supervisors first and then directors. Four of the nine supervisors were drawn by Chairman Lu Jianquan after a one-year term, including Lu Xuepu, Hu Mengjia, Huang Jinrong, and Rong Zongjing. In the lottery for the board of directors, each person drew their own. Among the sixteen people, because the term was divided into one, two, and three years, the one-year term was drawn for Shi Liangcai, Zhang Shouyong, Yang Zhixiong, Du Yuesheng, Li Fusun, and Sheng Xuechen. The two-year term was drawn for Ye Zhuotang, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Yongming, Yu Rizhang, and Hu Yunzhuang. The three-year term was drawn for Hu Bijiang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Lulin, and Huang Jiangquan.</p>
<p>Gao Tingzi's Talk Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Affairs Department, said that the review of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the past year roughly stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a long history of 60 years since its establishment. In November of last year, Minister of Finance Song and Minister of Communications Zhu jointly proposed to the Executive Yuan that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company be taken over as a state-owned enterprise. The proposal was approved by the 75th meeting of the Executive Yuan and then approved by the 331st meeting of the Central Political Council. It has been nearly a year since the bureau was taken back and returned to state ownership. In this year, because the past foundation has been damaged, the development of the bureau and the expansion of the shipping routes cannot be discussed. In the face of this situation, only the consolidation work can be done. The following are some of the more important aspects of consolidation (1) Organization and Talents After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was taken over by the state, the original Supervisory Office was reorganized into the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board, and a General Manager was established. People with prestige from all walks of life were selected to serve as directors, supervisors, and general managers to thoroughly reorganize and plan for the overall situation. The directors and supervisors are enthusiastic about maintaining the state-owned shipping industry, serving as volunteers and not paying salaries, and working together to shoulder the difficult task. The General Manager has a spirit of sacrifice, is determined to rectify the situation, and carefully observes the gradual trend of the bureau towards the right track, so it can be seen that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been properly consolidated, which we can be satisfied with. (2) Recovery of Shares The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a total of 42,000 sets of shares. Since the recovery began in December of last year, with the help of all parties and the efforts of the parties concerned, a total of 39,382 sets have been recovered by April 5th of this year. Only 2,025 sets have not been recovered. The price of the unrecovered shares has been deposited in the Central Bank, and shareholders can still sell them at any time. The government's purchase of private public utilities can be said to be fair and smooth. In previous years, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had evolved into a deadlock where the board of directors could not gather due to disputes over equity. This year, the government's recovery of shares has achieved such good results, which is a preliminary success of the consolidation work. (3) Consolidation of Old Debts It was found that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had repeatedly borrowed money due to poor business and insufficient income during the private era. The more debts, the heavier the burden, and the enterprise has made no progress. Therefore, borrowing new debts to repay old debts, compound interest is added, and the debt burden is increasing day by day. By the end of June of this year, the total debt has reached more than 21 million yuan. The situation is so extreme that bankruptcy is not enough to repay the debt. Now the bureau has hired experts to establish a debt consolidation committee to liquidate the debt and determine the repayment standards and methods. For those with smaller debts, there are installment repayment methods. For those with larger amounts that cannot be repaid for a while, methods have also been formulated to proceed step by step. (4) Construction and Repair of Wharves and Warehouses</p>
<p>The transportation of goods depends on the wharves and warehouses as the foundation. Most of the wharves and warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in various places have decayed. In addition, the management is incompetent, so the business competition is lagging behind. However, the location of the wharves and warehouses in various places is not inferior. It is only because of willful abandonment that they have become dilapidated. In addition, there are mortgages in front, and the transformation is thorny. It is urgent to expand and repair them in advance in order to attract customers. The wharves that need urgent repairs have been completed, and the remaining new projects, the budget estimates need 8 million yuan, and detailed tables and drawings have been prepared. As soon as the funds are available, they can be implemented. (5) Purchase of New Ships Most of the original ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are decades old, resulting in lagging behind in business for many years. In May of this year, the Central Political Council resolved to allocate the water conservancy project to be obtained from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, except for the Daohuai River, all the money stored in London that cannot be used now, which is estimated to be 360,000 to 400,000 pounds in British gold, temporarily borrowed for the purpose of improving the shipping industry. The Ministry of Communications ordered the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to sign a contract and repay in installments. In the future, the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity will allocate and lend to the original water conservancy agencies, and everything will still be handled according to the original plan. Subsequently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issued a budget for adding new ships, which is estimated to cost 4.48 million yuan in national currency to build four ocean-going ships to operate on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong line, and 1.72 million yuan in national currency for the materials for three river ships to operate on the Shanghai-Hankou-Yichang line. The preparation fee is estimated at 190,000 yuan. In the future, it will cost more than 1 million yuan in labor and materials to transport them back to China for manufacturing. The draft loan agreement has also been signed separately. New ships will be available for transportation in the autumn of next year, replacing the old ships, and the various bad habits of the old ships can also be eliminated at the same time. (6) Consolidation of Business The business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is limited by the outdated ships, insufficient tonnage, and heavy debt burden, and it has to bear huge interest every year, resulting in too much difference between income and expenditure. Even if there is a surplus in business, it is all used to pay off debts, and the debt is very large. This year's consolidation work has only made efforts to improve the original tools of the ships, warehouses, wharves, and branch offices in various ports, in order to increase income and reduce expenditure. In terms of increasing revenue, for example, renting additional ships, repairing docks, increasing the number of passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo liner on the Yangtze River, etc. In terms of cost saving, for example, abolishing ships with high coal consumption and reduced speed, inspecting private goods wrapped up, branch offices implementing a real reimbursement system, canceling the bureau's rules, re-ordering the fixed rates of labor and warehouse rent for each warehouse, and reforming the purchasing system of each ship by changing the manager and directly managing it by the bureau, etc., have either been implemented or are in progress. All these things have directly and indirectly increased income this year. It is estimated that the business income from January to June 22 years was more than 3.66 million yuan. It was found that the average business income for the same period in the four years of 18, 19, 20 and 21 years was only more than 2.79 million yuan. The amount of income increase in the first half of this year is compared with the previous four years, and the percentage of cargo revenue increased by 29%, passenger revenue increased by 44%, warehouse revenue increased by 33%, and the total amount increased by about 31%. In the future, when the economic strength is slightly improved and the new ships are completed, the business development is indeed promising.</p>

There are a total of twenty-eight. The silver smelting industry was established in the Song Dynasty. Because the silver from different places had different purity, it all had to be recast. Entrusted by banks and money shops, silver ingots were cast, with a long-standing reputation. The cast ingots had to be rated by the assay bureaus before they could be delivered to the banks or money shops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Arrived in Beijing Last Night: Striving to Resolve Outstanding Sino-Japanese Issues: Meeting with Wang to Exchange Views on Various Issues: Going to Beiping to Meet with Diplomatic Corps, Planned Stay of One Month</h3>
<p>The "New Life Society" reports that Japanese Minister to China, Akira Ariyoshi, took office during the tenure of Foreign Minister Uchida. Because of the excessive complexity of the internal situation in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, he has always maintained a wait-and-see attitude. After the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota took office, in order to cater to the wishes of the Japanese military cliques, he immediately expressed an active attitude toward China. Ariyoshi has also suddenly become active, striving to start Sino-Japanese negotiations in order to resolve all outstanding issues between China and Japan. Therefore, there have been repeated rumors of his going north. Recently, Ariyoshi has visited Beijing several times and met with key figures in the central government. A turning point seems to have been reached in the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Therefore, after Minister Jiang Zuobin went to Japan to assume his post and Huang Fu left Beiping, Ariyoshi received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and decided to go north. He took the express train to Beijing last night at 11:00 PM, with a special carriage attached. He plans to stay in Beijing for one or two days, meeting with Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei to exchange views on the North China issue, and then take the Jinpu Railway to Beiping.

<h3>Closure of Assay Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Assay Bureau at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Jiangxi Road ceased operations immediately after receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance and is handling the closure, posting a notice at the entrance that reads, "By order of the Ministry of Finance, operations are ceased as of today." The history of the assay bureau dates back nearly a hundred years, established by Wang Lanting from Anhui. It is publicly acknowledged by silver and money merchants. The silver ingots on the market must be rated before they can be used. The rating fee is 2.4 cents per ingot. If there are any unreported or unrated ingots, the rating fee must be paid retroactively. After the rated ingots are collected by various businesses, they are flattened again. The assaying method includes (1) weighing and (2) grading. Those who weigh are called "scale managers," and those who grade are called "graders," who use their eyesight to judge the purity. High purity is rated as "Shen Shui two taels seven mace five fen," and low purity is rated as "Shen Shui two taels six mace five fen." Those weighing more than forty-nine taels and eight qian are rated at five fen per tael. Those with a purity below two taels and six mace five fen are not rated. Each ingot is based on a standard of forty-nine taels and eight qian.</p>
<h3>Planned Business Transformation</h3>
<p>Yao Daji, a director of the Silver Smelting Industry Association, told a reporter from the "New Life Society" yesterday that the Silver Smelting Industry Association is entirely organized by capital and has a long history. This time, the silver smelters have been ordered to cease operations, and they are preparing to change their direction and seek other financial businesses. The association is concerned about the industry's past creditworthiness in precious silver and should continue to maintain it. Regarding relief for unemployed workers, registration procedures have been handled in order to comply with the ministry's order and request the Central Mint to conduct examinations for employment. In addition, the Shanghai Silver Smelting Industry Unemployed Workers Group issued a notice yesterday that the group has been prepared and established, and forms have been prepared for handling the registration of unemployed workers. The deadline is November 20th. All workers who believe they have the necessary skills are requested to come and obtain forms before the deadline, fill them out, and register in accordance with Order No. 45 from the Ministry of Finance and proceed to the Central Mint for examination and employment. Do not delay yourselves. If you are elderly, other measures will be considered within the realm of possibility. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>Placement of the Unemployed</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan, silver ingots cannot circulate in the market. The silver smelting industry is therefore naturally eliminated. When this was initially implemented, silver from various places was continuously transported to Shanghai to be exchanged for silver coins. Because the types of silver varied, such as horseshoe-shaped, square-shaped, and fragmented silver, their purity was inconsistent. It had to be melted through silver smelters and the silver grade was determined by the assay bureaus before it could be exchanged for silver coins or delivered to banks and money shops. Now that the monetary system has been unified throughout the country, the silver smelters will have no silver to melt. As for the unemployed workers, the assay bureaus have about 20 people engaged in grading, assaying, and flattening. The silver smelters have a total of about 1,000 workers. It has been decided that the Central Mint will conduct examinations for employment. However, because the Central Mint's examination procedures have not yet been prepared, the registration date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Workers Request Relief</h3>
<p>Over a thousand unemployed silver smelter workers formed an unemployment group and submitted a document to the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, stating that the petitioners, Jin Jiamao, Yu Yanrong, Yang Zhixin, Chen Guoliang, and Xie Xiankui, representatives of the Shanghai Silver Smelting Industry Unemployed Workers Group, are submitting this petition because the silver smelters have ceased operations in compliance with orders, and the workers' accumulated donation fund is requested to be returned to relieve unemployment and maintain livelihoods. It is a fact that our country has been using silver ingots for a long time. Since trade with foreign countries began, Mexican silver dollars were the first to be introduced. This was the beginning of the use of the yuan. Later, Shanghai's commerce developed, and silver ingots were transported from the interior provinces to be melted and converted into native silver for market demand. Then there came the organization of silver smelting guilds. Jiamao and others have been engaged in this industry for generations, specializing in smelting work in silver smelters. This industry has been learned since childhood, and the workers have specialized skills that cannot be filled by general laborers. The establishment of the guild was based on donations to create a fund. Within the workers' wages, 2.5 hao of silver was deducted for each ingot smelted, accumulating a large sum. The guild was established on this basis. Over the years, the assets purchased and accumulated through donations have reached several hundred thousand yuan. There are a total of 28 silver smelters in Shanghai, with over 1,000 workers, and with their families, there are several thousand people who depend on this for a living. Recently, the government issued an order to abolish the tael and change to the yuan, and the Shanghai silver smelters have completely ceased operations. The workers have no work to do, and they have specialized skills, so it is difficult to switch to other industries. Their situation is different from that of workers in yarn factories or machine factories, who can move from one factory to another. They lack the means to make a living, and their future is worrying. The unemployment of Jiamao and others is entirely due to government orders, and the silver smelter owners, who are capitalists, have also stopped operations at the same time, which is different from other layoffs. After repeated consideration, the only solution is to sell the assets purchased with the guild's donation fund and return the proceeds to provide relief. This is fair and just, both in terms of reason and law. Therefore, we are submitting this petition, explaining the reasons for organizing the Silver Smelting Industry Unemployed Workers Group, requesting your department to review and approve it for record, and for the following relief measures: (1) Approve the dispatch of personnel to guide; (2) Order the Shanghai Silver Smelting Guild (located at Jubao Lane, Tiantong Road, North Henan Road) and the directors stationed there to hand over the property deeds and accumulated assets purchased, so that they can be fairly valued, distributed, and provided as relief; (3) The unemployed workers' legal request to receive the donation fund. If the guild illegally suppresses them, please provide timely protection to prevent the workers from becoming agitated and the situation from escalating. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for your review.</p>
<h3>Hainan Island Sugar Merchant Representative Xing Juefei Goes to Beijing to Petition: Hainan Sugar Comes to Shanghai to Compete with Foreign Sugar in the Market: Suddenly Detained by the Jianghai and Qionghai Customs Without Reason: Sugar Merchant Representative Will Go to Beijing to Petition for Protection</h3>
<p>Southern China produces the most sugar in Hainan Island and Taiwan. Since Taiwan was ceded to Japan, Hainan Island is the only sugar-producing area. Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, Hainan sugar had an output of 150,000 bags. Calculated at the current market price, the export amount is about 4 million yuan. With this industry, merchants and farmers have greatly benefited. After the establishment of the Republic of China, internal wars occurred frequently, and the local areas were unstable. In addition, foreign sugar was dumped, and the Hainan Island sugar industry suffered a major blow and almost collapsed. From the 17th to the 21st year of the Republic of China, its export volume was only more than 10,000 bags, a decrease of 80% compared with the previous index, which is shocking. The amount of loss can be imagined. Fortunately, last year, the Guangdong Military Police Guard Brigade crossed over to Hainan Island and established the Pacification Commissioner's Office. The bandits and communists were cleared away, and the villagers were properly pacified, so the rural areas began to recover. In addition, tariffs were autonomous, and foreign sugar was heavily taxed, so most farmers planted sugarcane, produced local sugar, and sold it to the domestic market. In recent months, there has been a great event in the Shanghai market of Hainan sugar competing with foreign sugar. Unexpectedly, while it was being sold vigorously, Hainan sugar exports were suddenly detained by the Qionghai and Jianghai Customs, claiming that it was mixed with foreign sugar, and forced to confiscate it and fine the merchants. The sugar merchants are in this environment, where right and wrong are not distinguished, and the future is bleak. Most of them have announced that they will stop selling, but the sugar-producing farmers, who have been hit by this, are greatly agitated. More than 100,000 farmers in Hainan Island rely on this to maintain their livelihoods. Now that they see their livelihood is being cut off, how can they tolerate it? The authorities in Hainan Island, seeing this crisis, responded to the request of the Haikou City Chamber of Commerce and tried to maintain it. The City Chamber of Commerce and the sugar merchants sent a representative, Xing Juefei, with sugar samples and official documents, to Nanjing to petition, hoping that Hainan sugar exports will be protected in the future, and to overturn the unjust cases of giant merchants, such as Jusheng, Huasheng, Yongcheng, Qiongtaixing, Haisheng, and Jushang, who were punished and confiscated by the customs. The representative arrived in Shanghai by the President ship from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (16th) and is now staying at the Datong Hotel. A reporter went to inquire, and the conversation is recorded as follows: (Question) Is there really foreign sugar mixed in the Hainan sugar that comes to Shanghai? (Answer) This is what the Customs Service of the Qionghai and Jianghai Customs said, but the Hainan Island sugar merchants said that the sugar transported to Shanghai is pure local sugar, and there are inspection forms to prove it. (Question) This is a case of conflicting opinions. Does your representative have any third-party proof? (Answer) Yes, there is a local sugar field investigation team organized by the Hainan Island authorities, which came to the sugar-producing area to take out pure local sugar and publicly inspected it in the Chamber of Commerce, proving that the white sugar from the Shizi Road of Qiongshan County is the same as the sugar that was detained in Shanghai from merchants such as Yongcheng. Now, the sugar samples have been sealed and handed over to me (i.e., Representative Xing) to take to Nanjing and present them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for inspection, to distinguish between the two, so as to avoid losses to the merchants. (Question) Does the central government attach importance to this issue? (Answer) I have not yet entered Beijing, so I do not know. However, in view of the fact that foreign governments attach importance to and seek complete solutions to problems that arise in one place and affect the lives of more than 100,000 people, and the central government is advocating relief for rural areas and development of production, it is believed that it will not underestimate the destruction of this local sugar and will eventually comfort our merchants and farmers. (Question) Hong Kong newspapers reported that overseas Chinese attach great importance to this matter. Is this true? (Answer) Yes, because recently, overseas Chinese who returned to China brought back some surplus capital and planned to invest in Hainan Island's industries. If this problem is not resolved, it will inevitably discourage them, because they are afraid that right and wrong will not be distinguished and that all exported goods will be affected in the future.</p>
<h3>Provincial Food Conference: Guangdong Representative Wen Zhongqi Arrives in Shanghai: Discussing the Issue of Guangdong's Tax on Imported Rice</h3>
<p>The "National News Agency" reports that Chairman Chiang convened a food conference for various provinces, which opened in Nanchang on October 20. The Guangdong Provincial Government specially appointed Wen Zhongqi as its representative to attend. After being appointed, Wen, as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, immediately boarded the President ship and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, staying at the Datong Hotel. A reporter, because the issue of Guangdong's tax on imported rice is of great concern to society, made a special visit. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>History of Taxation</h3>
<p>The public is quite surprised by Guangdong Province's levy of tax on imported rice because it was announced suddenly. In fact, on the government side, this matter has been brewing for a long time. This spring, the Guangdong branch of the Chinese Agricultural Society decided at a meeting in Guangzhou to request the Guangdong Provincial Government to immediately levy tax on imported rice to relieve the rural areas. The provincial government believed that this move was of great importance and did not immediately make a decision. Later, the Guangdong Political Research Association established the Chinese Agricultural Society. Because Feng Rui, the director of the Guangdong Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, a member of the Society, was also a member of the Political Research Association, he was asked to propose the case to the Political Research Association. After being proposed, the Political Research Association handed it over to the Economic Group for research. The Economic Group discussed it several times over three months. At the same time, agricultural associations from various parts of Guangdong, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, and various important guilds and labor unions requested the government to quickly levy import tax on imported rice. The Economic Group then reported the results of the review to the Political Research Association. The Political Research Association unanimously approved it and suggested that the provincial government adopt it. Therefore, judging from its history, Guangdong Province's levy of rice tax can be said to have been proposed by the people, and the government implemented it after the people urged the government to conduct long-term research.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Supervision</h3>
<p>Merchants in Guangdong with economic vision believe that the sale of goods depends entirely on the rural areas. The market has been cold in recent years because the rural areas have declined and the farmers' purchasing power has disappeared. The workers also believe that after the market prospers and the economy recovers, they will not be unemployed, and wages can be gradually increased, so the gains outweigh the losses. Therefore, at that time, only a part of the rice importers opposed it. However, they soon understood the government's policy and paid taxes in accordance with regulations. As for why the provincial government did not notify the merchants of the intention to levy taxes in advance, but announced it suddenly, it was because if the rice merchants were notified in advance, they could import as much foreign rice as possible. This would be tantamount to encouraging the rice merchants to dump foreign rice as much as possible in a short period of time, which would in turn cause a major blow to the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Tax Rate Issue</h3>
<p>Currently, the tax is one yuan per dan of foreign rice. Some may think that the tax rate is too high. However, the purpose of levying rice tax this time is to relieve the rural areas, not to increase revenue. To increase revenue, the tax rate must be low, so that foreign rice can still compete with domestic rice, and the source can be imported continuously. If the purpose is to relieve the rural areas, then the tax rate cannot be high. As a result of the dumping of foreign rice in the rural areas of Guangdong Province, the price of grain in the Northeast and Jiangnan areas is only three yuan per dan, which is not enough for fertilizer, labor, and seed costs. If it is not protected by an effective tax amount, then the farmers will only abandon cultivation. We have an example here that is sufficient to tell you that Guangdong Province was originally a sugar-producing area. At its peak, Guangdong sugar was sold to the Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Later, it was invaded by Java, Philippine, and Taikoo sugar. Now, more than 30 million yuan of white sugar is imported into Guangdong every year, and the Guangdong sugar industry has been completely defeated. Now, the government plans to revive the sugar industry and set up factories to manufacture it, but when investigating the raw materials, the sugarcane fields have been abandoned. Although the government wants to revive it urgently, it is impossible. Therefore, if we do not urgently relieve the rural economy, after the farmland is abandoned, it will be difficult to relieve it. Therefore, at that time, it was decided that the tax rate would be one yuan, and it was also decided that the tax revenue would be used to develop the rural economy and improve agricultural production.</p>
<h3>Current Rice Price</h3>
<p>This time, the Guangdong rice merchants opposed the government's levy of rice tax, and sent a telegram, saying that Guangdong rice was only enough for four months' food, which was alarming. Since the first year of the Republic of China, the statistics of foreign rice entering Guangdong show that the least was in the ninth year of the Republic of China, only 767,196 dan, and the most was in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, 17,123,440 dan. On average, the population of Guangdong is 35 million, and each person eats at least an average of 3 dan of rice per year, which means that at least 10.5 million dan are needed each year. The shortfall of Guangdong rice is less than one-tenth. After the rice tax is levied, the domestic rice can be transported to the cities, and the national rice can also be transported to Guangdong, so the food supply in Guangdong Province is not a problem. In recent years, the Guangdong Provincial Government has been actively working to increase agricultural production. The trial of improving grain seeds has been successful. With just the Dongguan White variety, the annual production can be increased by 10%, etc. Now, promotion offices have been established in various counties to promote all improved seeds and agricultural implements in the rural areas. Therefore, by just changing the grain seeds, Guangdong Province can have surplus food. Now, fertilizer factories and agricultural implement factories have been prepared for establishment, and the funds are allocated from the rice tax revenue. At the beginning of the tax levy, the rice merchants once hoarded, and the rice price increased by about one yuan, but it soon decreased, because the price of Annam rice fell, and the domestic rice poured in at the same time.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Political Research Association</h3>
<p>Wen also talked about the Guangdong Political Research Association, saying that its nature is as its name implies, organized by senior party, government, and military personnel to study the political reform and innovation of Guangdong, and the research results are handed over to various agencies for adoption and implementation, not everything as rumored outside. The Guangdong Three-Year Plan is being carried out in accordance with the schedule. Material construction has exceeded the schedule. Those that have been completed include cement factories, sulfuric acid factories, soda factories, Haizhu Iron Bridge, and Haizhu Embankment. Those that are currently under construction include silk factories, Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, sugar factories, fertilizer factories, agricultural implement factories, and the Guangzhou Inner Harbor to Shantou Railway and Sanhe Railway are also being surveyed.</p>

<h3>International Opposition: Committee to Abolish the Gold Standard: Initiated by the Swiss National Bank Association</h3>
<p>News from the Swiss Consulate-General in Shanghai: The Swiss National Bank Association, together with the bond fund protection committees of France, Germany, and Belgium, recently organized a committee. On June 30th, a meeting was convened in Basel, Switzerland, and a group was formed, called the International Committee to Oppose the Abolition of the Gold Standard. The committee, in view of the interests of creditors being affected by the abolition of the gold standard in debtor countries, has risen to make every effort to protect it.</p>
<h3>National Goods Touring Group Arrived in Bengbu Last Night: To Participate in the Bengbu National Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Touring Group was invited by the Anhui Provincial Third Public Education Museum and the Bengbu City National Goods Promotion Committee. Led by three groups, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, and the China National Goods Maintenance Association, they went to Bengbu to participate in the Bengbu City National Goods Exhibition. Seventy-six factories participated, with more than 250 representatives and staff members from each factory. They departed on a special express train at 11:00 PM last night. In advance, Mr. Wang Shifang of the Railway Business Office came to the meeting to take care of the luggage and transport it on their behalf. The association also specially dispatched Zhu Jinxiang, Huang Shaozhi, Wang Zhaolin, Wen Jichun, Wu Zishi, and Sun Baohui, various staff members to the station to take care of everything. The order was in good order and methodical. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation, Zhengyi Society, and other groups sent representatives Zhu Boyuan, Liu Zhongying, Shao Daren, Xu Yunhui, Zhu Dechao, Yang Yucheng, Dong Boying, Wang Jiean, and Xu Genghua to the station to see them off. It was a grand occasion. In addition to sending Chen Guoming, Zhu Juewu, and Xu Yaowei, various staff members to serve with the group, the association also publicly elected Standing Committee members Chen Binghui, Xu Jianruo, and Zhang Dezhai, and Secretary Huang Mengtu to go to Bengbu to preside over the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Private Feud Over "Enemy Iron" - Mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Results in Sealing and Melting</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association of this city has been, since the September 18th Incident, both encouraging and prohibiting its members from purchasing and using "enemy iron" (Japanese iron), thus showing extraordinary achievements in the work of resisting it. At the same time, amid the nationwide call for resistance, the Iron Trade Association also conducted a temporary seizure of Japanese iron. However, by the beginning of this year, there were signs that the seized enemy iron was being sold off gradually, and there were even behaviors of disguising it to falsely claim it as Yangtze iron. In mid-May, the Xiangfeng Foundry even publicly resumed using over 200 tons of previously sealed enemy iron. The news spread, causing public outcry, and the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association found it intolerable. It sent responsible representatives to investigate on May 21st, and concrete evidence was found. The Xiangfeng Foundry, realizing it was in the wrong, obediently applied white paste to mark it for identification and promised not to use it again. The Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association, assuming that the enemy goods of each factory had been sealed by the association, followed the precedent and sent personnel to transport it on June 10th. However, at this time, the storage location of the enemy iron already had seals from the Iron Trade Association, so they were left sealed in their original place. Unexpectedly, rumors spread that the Xiangfeng Foundry was still continuing to use the sealed pig iron. On August 28th, a review found that a considerable amount of the enemy iron had indeed been used, and the seals of the Iron Trade Association had also been removed. Under mutual questioning, the Xiangfeng Foundry formally replied in writing that it was instructed by the Xiangtai Ironworks to melt the iron according to the resolution of the Iron Trade Association. The whole inside story was exposed, and the issue of resisting goods versus protecting them turned into a war of words between the two trade associations, with endless mutual attacks. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, caught in a dilemma, had no choice but to convene both parties for mediation the other day to avoid disputes. The result was that the Iron Trade Association would reseal the iron itself and decide that Xiangfeng would never melt this iron again. Xiangtai's iron would be melted and destroyed by itself and could no longer be sold to foundries. Both parties agreed and signed to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers from Fang Ji's Troops Left Behind in Tangshan - Red Swastika Society Adds a Medical Team for Treatment</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society received reports yesterday, one after another, from the forward relief team of the society and a request from the 130th Division of the National Army stationed in Shahe, stating that after the various units under Fang Ji withdrew from Tangshan, over two hundred wounded soldiers were left behind. In the Tangshan Garden, some had broken shoulders and legs, crying out in pain, in extremely miserable conditions. They requested immediate relief. Upon hearing the news, the society considered the large number of wounded soldiers and immediately organized a large medical team, carrying a large amount of medicines to the location to work with the relief team originally stationed there, establishing a temporary treatment center to take in and treat all the wounded soldiers. At the same time, a temporary refugee shelter was also established to provide relief to nearby refugees.</p>
<h3>Tian Songyao Cables Shanghai to Refute Rumors</h3>
<p>Tian Songyao, the Sichuan military commander, was reportedly resigning and going abroad the other day. Recently, Mr. Tian cabled his confidant Zhang Minyi in Shanghai from Sichuan: "Zhang Minyi, my brother in Shanghai: The reports in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan are falsely accusing me of having any intention to retreat, of sending personnel to Ruigan to seek residence, of generals plotting to find a way out, and of soldiers becoming bandits due to displacement. This is the work of those who are jealous of me. An immediate investigation is underway. Furthermore, the Shanghai report that my troops in Mianyang are levying grain, causing the county people to oppose and riot at the government offices, is also completely untrue, an arbitrary slander. My troops suppressed the Communists, making meritorious contributions throughout Sichuan. I hope you will uphold justice and refute the rumors nearby to correct public opinion."</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Between the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Wuxi-Jiangyin Bus Line - Both Parties Have Signed a Joint Transportation Agreement</h3>
<p>The privately-run Wuxi-Jiangyin Long-Distance Bus Company, in order to facilitate passengers and merchants, negotiated with the Railway Bureau to establish joint transportation. Both parties have agreed and signed a joint transportation agreement for passengers, luggage, and packages. The main points are as follows: (1) The joint transportation stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway are Shanghai North, Kunshan, Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing (seven stations).

<h3>Cohabitation with a Wealthy Widow for Thirteen Years - Abandoned and Neglected After Wealth Was Exhausted - Where Is Zhang Yangsheng's Conscience?</h3>
<p>Yang Xi, a local widow, is 43 years old. Her husband died 14 years ago in Yangjiazhai, Pudong, leaving her with a vast inheritance. Her only daughter has already married. However, she was not accustomed to sleeping alone and gradually socialized with men. A tailor, a local man named Zhang, was skilled in language and adept at flattery. Admiring Yang's wealth, he pursued her. Zhang was young and handsome at the time, and he was eventually successful, becoming her intimate partner. The following year, he cohabited with her for thirteen years. They were very close to each other. Yang was anesthetized by Zhang, believing that only Zhang could grow old with her. However, Zhang originally had a wife. His intention was not in the wine. Under sweet enticements, he gradually took over 5,000 yuan in cash from Yang to increase his own property. Recently, he learned that all of Yang's inheritance was about to be exhausted, so he abandoned her and neglected her. Yang suddenly suffered this blow and fell ill with fright. Unable to afford medical treatment, she sold her own house for several hundred yuan and moved to Laiyidu Street. However, her illness became increasingly severe and critical. Yesterday, her daughter hired people to carry her sick body on a door panel to the entrance of Zhang's residence at 7 Yanqing Lane, Police Station Road.</p>
<p>Zhang had already locked the door tightly. Only Zhang's wife, Ding, appeared and shouted for help. The police arrived and took Ding, along with Yang and her daughter, to the district. According to Ding's statement, she is 40 years old, a local. Her husband's name is Zhang Yangsheng. He is out and has not returned. This morning, more than ten people suddenly arrived, for reasons unknown, and aggressively carried a sick woman to her home and caused trouble. She requested an investigation. According to Yang Xi's statement, she is 43 years old, a local. Her husband passed away 14 years ago. She has been intimate with Zhang Yangsheng for 13 years, wanting to be a long-term couple with him. Therefore, she gradually handed over 5,400 yuan to him for management. Unexpectedly, Zhang had bad intentions. This year, he instructed a wild boy to entice me into adultery. Zhang deliberately broke in and then used it as an excuse to abandon me and neglect me. Now my illness is very serious, but he does not even plan to meet me. Such a loss of conscience is truly heartbreaking. She requested redress. According to Yang Xi's daughter, Shen Yang, she is 23 years old and lives on the east end of Yangjing Temple. Her mother has been with Yangsheng for 13 years. She has also long recognized him as her father. Last year, before I got married, my husband sent 500 yuan as a betrothal gift, which was also taken away by Yangsheng. He has added a lot of real estate, but it has made my mother impoverished and suffer. According to Yang Xi's maid, Yang Zhang, and nephew Zhang Xihua, they testified in the district. Yang Zhang stated that she is 72 years old and lives in the Laobaidu area. After my son died, all the inheritance was taken away by the daughter-in-law and given to Zhang Yangsheng. Now I am here to investigate. Zhang Xihua stated that he is 36 years old and lives at 68 Huayuan Stone Bridge. Yang Xi is my aunt, and Zhang Yangsheng abandoned her after starting a relationship with her. Now my aunt is seriously ill, but Yangsheng ignores her. Therefore, today, I am helping to carry the patient to the Yang family to reason with them. The district chief, because the main defendant in this case has not yet arrived, instructed the patient to first be carried home for medical treatment and, at the same time, instructed her to prepare a statement and sue in court.</p>
<h3>Respectfully Prepared Ministry - Prisoners Oppose the Separate Room System - The Result Is a Stipulated Time for Inmates to Meet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Command Prison has a majority of those imprisoned as anti-revolutionary criminals, accounting for more than seven-tenths of the total. During Commander Xiong Shihui's time, there was a separate room system, meaning that each room had a fixed number of inmates, isolated from each other, with very few opportunities to gather and talk. After Commander Xiong left office, this method gradually disappeared invisibly. As a result, all inmates were able to gather together, talk about everything, and use this to relieve the boredom of prison life. When Acting Commander Wu took office this time, he planned to restore the old system of separate rooms. Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the inmates rose up in protest two days ago, asking him to postpone its implementation, and agreed on a hunger strike to express their determination. As a result, Acting Commander Wu, out of consideration for the inmates, made a special accommodation and formulated a new method, which is to stipulate a certain time to give the inmates opportunities to approach each other. The inmates were satisfied, and the slight disturbance was calmed.</p>

<h3>Son of a Night Soil Head Kidnapped - Instigated by His First Wife - The Son Was Born to a Concubine - The First Wife Poisoned Out of Jealousy - Killed a Maid - The Night Soil Head Was Also Injured - Most of the Conspirators Were from the Mother's Side - The Case Occurred Last April and Has Only Now Been Clarified</h3>
<p>Wang Cheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, detectives Yang Xiguang, Wang Jinshou, Hua Youshan, detective Li Yingming, Liu Zhongcheng, apprehended thirteen bandits Wang Jinsheng, Pan Rugao, Chen Desheng, etc. from Jiangbei at 328 Datong Road, New Xing Restaurant, 29 Yixing Lane, Manzhou Road, Zhabei, a bungalow on Robertson Road, and 62 Chezhan East Road in the South City, and confiscated one pistol and nine bullets. They were successively sent to the First Special District Court. The police station found that the defendants had committed many theft cases in the Public Concession, and Chen Desheng had committed a kidnapping case. Please detain them for detailed investigation. During the extended period, Chen confessed that at about 6 am on April 27th last year, he and his gang held weapons to kidnap a four-year-old boy, Fuhai, from 722 Weihaiwei Road, who served as a</p>
<h3>night soil head Wang Zilin</h3>
<p>The hideout was in a village in Tongzhou, demanding a large sum of money. Later, Wang, who was at the age of knowing his destiny, had only this one child. Fearing an accident, he heard that 40,000 gold was used to redeem him and pointed out the location of the case. The Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to 11 Junan Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, 318 Dongyouheng Road, 963 Xi'an Road, and 31 Yunnong Fang, North Sichuan Road at about 7 pm the other night. The escaped kidnapping leader Yan Shirong (Wang Zilin's brother-in-law), his wife Yan Chenzhen, Xiang Wenshan (formerly Wang's accountant), Yang Pengxiang, Mu Xiaosizi (Wang's hired hand), Wang Yan (Wang's first wife), all from Jiangbei, and Xu Yunsun from Anhui (Wang's son-in-law, an employee at the customs) because Wang's wife and son-in-law were</p>
<h3>suspected of instigating</h3>
<p>They were brought to the police station for questioning and were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the case was complicated. At 6 am on April 27th last year, Wang Zilin's four-year-old son Fuhai was</p>
<p>kidnapped. At that time, the bandits opened fire and killed a maid. Wang Zilin was also shot and injured. The reason for the kidnapping was that the child Fuhai was born to Wang's beloved concubine Zhang. The first wife, the defendant Yan, had a daughter but no son, and Wang loved Fuhai like a jewel. He doted on Zhang too much, which made Yan unhappy, so she discussed it with her brother Yan Shirong and her son-in-law Xu Yunsun and reached an agreement. That morning, they hired a car and, along with Xiang Wen, Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiaosizi, Chen Desheng, and the fugitive Yan Shirong,</p>
<h3>kidnapped Fuhai</h3>
<p>Now, please question them and return them to custody and escort them for interrogation together with Wang Jinshan, etc. According to Yan Chen's statement, her husband Shirong is Wang Zilin's wife's brother. That morning, Wang Jinshan, Zhang Laowu, Chen Daocai, Mu Xiaosizi, and her husband Shirong and I were in the car together and stopped near the back door of Wang's house. After a while, those people went inside. In a moment, Chen Daocai took Fuhai out and handed him over to me. We drove to Huishan Pier and took the child on a boat. I went home immediately. Later, I heard that Fuhai was taken to Chongming. My husband returned home in early May last year and said that he would be back in a few days, but there has been no news since then. Xiang Wenshan stated that he had been working as an accountant at Wang's place for more than ten years. Yan and Zhang were at odds and often quarreled, and Yan Shirong often went to Wang's house to discuss with his sister Yan and her son-in-law Xu Yunsun in the厢房 (side room) many times. Later, he asked me to join. That morning, I, Yan Shirong, Xu Yunsun, Yang Yuexiang, and Mu Xiaosizi got into the car from Xi'an Road and drove to</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Road to get off</h3>
<p>and Yan and Mu had pistols and went into Wang's house. In a moment, they took Fuhai out and handed him over to Yan Chen to take in the car. I also had a pistol at the time. Yang Yuexiang stated that I was not in Shanghai that day because I had eye disease and returned to Jiangbei for treatment. Xiang Wenshan's statement is completely untrue. Mu Xiaosizi stated that I and my employer Wang Zilin are also relatives. I have been working for him for more than 20 years. As for the kidnapping case, it is all Xiang's nonsense to harm me. Wang Yan stated that her husband had always treated me well and had a good relationship with his concubine Zhang. I have a son and a daughter. My son is 21 years old. I really did not instigate the kidnapping of Fuhai. If I wanted to harm him, I would never have asked my husband to redeem him with ten thousand gold. The police station lawyer Zhang stated that</p>
<h3>his son is adopted</h3>
<p>Xu is not his biological son. Yun Sun confessed that Xiang Wenshan's accusation was completely false because he was an accountant at his father-in-law's place, but his gambling was stopped by his mother-in-law Yan in May of this year, and he had a grudge and framed him. Please investigate and extend the lawyer to request bail. The police station lawyer Zhang also stated that the Second Special Court now has a bandit named Jiang Henghua. The three pistols used by the defendants at the time were supplied by him. Please ask the court to transfer him to testify in the next court hearing. Judge Liu Yugui said that the case was serious and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately and tried together with Wang Jinshan, etc.</p>
<h3>Car Company Owner - Seduces Beautiful Maid - Had Agreed to the Betrothal Money with the Maid's Grandmother - Planned to Discuss Payment Procedures and Was Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Cui, a woman from Suzhou, is in her sixties and has been working as a maid in a certain surname's house in Datong Lane, Datong Road. Her granddaughter, Chen Aju, lost her father at the age of six, so she was raised by her. Now she is 16 years old and has become beautiful. Because she felt that her family was poor, she was brought by her grandmother Chen Cui to a job introduction store on Datong Road to wait for recommendations, so that she could reduce her burden. However, Xu Fusheng, a local man, opened a car repair shop at 266 Datong Road, next door to the job introduction store. Xu, who was in his early twenties, had no wife, was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, and considered himself romantic. Seeing that Chen was not ugly and spoke with the soft Wu dialect, he could not help but be moved and wanted to take advantage of her, so he often flirted with Chen at the door, and repeatedly teased her. Chen was still young and inexperienced, and her will was weak, so she was hooked in a few days. On the evening of the 14th of last month, Xu seduced the girl and first went to the rooftop garden of the Xianshi Company to play. At midnight, they went to the Zhongshan Hotel at 72 Tianjin Road and opened room 24, where they spent the night together, and their love was like the sea. Chen's chastity was declared broken that night. For several nights in a row, until the 17th, it was suddenly discovered by the girl's grandmother Chen Cui that her granddaughter had been seduced by Xu, so she went to the Zhongshan Hotel and saw Xu and Chen Aju together. When</p>
<h3>The Xinhe Kang Sandboat Robbed and Murdered by Pirates: Three Killed, Three Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The Xinhe Kang sandboat of Dalian belongs to the Shengji Company of Dalian, which has a branch in Shanghai. The boat specializes in transporting goods for merchants, traveling back and forth to earn water freight. This time, it loaded soybeans, oils and other northern goods worth five to six ten thousand yuan in Dalian, to be transported to Shanghai for unloading. On the twelfth of this month, when sailing on the Qingkou sea area at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong, it suddenly encountered a pirate ship speeding towards it, firing shots to order it to stop. The boat owner, Xing, and the crew saw that there were more than ten pirates on the pirate ship. Thinking that there were more than twenty crew members on their boat, they could still resist, so they ordered the crew to unfurl the sails and sail with all their might, while resisting, to prevent the pirates from boarding. However, the pirate ship was smaller and faster, and they were overtaken. The pirates swarmed aboard. The crew used bamboo bows to knock three pirates into the sea. The pirates dared not jump aboard, and fired wildly at the Xinhe Kang. The Xinhe Kang tried its best to sail away, but the pirate ship continued to fire and follow behind. Suddenly, two large pirate ships with three masts, filled with a large gang of pirates, sailed over and surrounded the Xinhe Kang. The pirates on those ships were told that three pirates had been knocked into the sea, and they were extremely angry. The pirates, armed with guns, knives, or clubs, swarmed onto the boat and attacked everyone they saw, driving the crew to the bow of the boat and demanding to know who had knocked their brothers into the sea. When the crew did not answer, the pirates opened fire, killing three and wounding five or six. At that time, the boat owner, Xing, was hiding under the stove and was dragged out by the pirates. They immediately cut off his right arm with a knife and tried to throw him into the sea. Xing begged for mercy and was spared. The pirates searched everywhere, robbing all the silver dollars, about seven or eight hundred yuan. Before leaving, they kidnapped three crew members and forced the remaining crew to sail the boat towards the Yantai sea area, with one pirate ship following behind to monitor them. When it was dark, they no longer saw the pirate ship monitoring them, so the boat sailed to Qingkou and anchored. They inspected the boat and found many holes from the bullets. Xing and the injured were sent to the hospital. The three crew members who had been killed by the pirates were bought coffins for after borrowing silver dollars from other ships. The crew members of that ship took a steamer to Shanghai to report to the branch company and the various cargo companies, requesting them to find a way to rescue the kidnapped crew members.</p>
<h3>Gunfire on Zhongshan Road: Stealing Vegetables Falsely Accused as Vehicle Theft - A Misunderstanding Causes a Dispute: Rickshaw Puller's False Report Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Around 8 o'clock the night before last, five rickshaw pullers from Yancheng, Yu Chenyong, Qi Suhua, Qi Youhua, Lu Yingkui, and Ji Guangzhi, residing at No. 53 Zhou Shen Lane, West of Xujiahui Town, Shanghai, were pulling their rickshaws home. When they reached the vegetable garden area west of Xiaozha, Yu Chenyong, who was last in line, stopped his rickshaw by the side of the road and went into the vegetable garden to steal four cabbages. The garden owner, Chen Shengquan, a local, spotted him and chased after him. Yu abandoned his rickshaw and fled. At this time, the four rickshaw pullers who were with him were already two li away. Yu then lied to them, saying that the rickshaw he was pulling, No. 30983, had been robbed on the road behind them. Qi and the other three, unaware of the truth, believed him and gathered dozens of rickshaw pullers, rushing back to capture Chen Shengquan. They surrounded and beat him, and reported to the Tushanwan Police Station, falsely claiming a robbery. When the villagers learned the truth, more and more gathered, feeling indignant. They rescued Chen Shengquan. For a time, there was a noisy clamor, and police whistles sounded in chaos. Zhou Yougen and Lu Ziying, members of the 10th team of the South Shanghai District He Wei Corps, also heard the noise and arrived. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lu fired several shots into the sky. At this time, Liang Zhichao, the police chief of the police station, also arrived with armed officers. For self-defense, he drew his pistol and fired two shots. After investigating the cause of the incident, it was learned that a misunderstanding had occurred between the two sides. However, the rickshaw pullers' false report of robbery was also wrong. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers Yu Chenyong and the other four, along with the villagers Chen Shengquan, Lu Shui Ji, and Zhou Shunji, a total of eight people, were taken to the police station and temporarily detained, pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Brother and Cousin Allegedly Had an Affair: Younger Brother Enraged and Wanted to Kill His Brother</h3>
<p>Xiao Gengsheng, from Nanjing, is 50 years old, and his wife, Xiao Jiangshi, is also 50 years old. They live at No. 14 Hede Lane, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. His younger brother, named Dongchen, is 45 years old, and his wife, Xiao Qianshi, is 30 years old. Their cousin, Zhou Jiangshi, is 30 years old. All of them work at the British American Tobacco Factory. They can all support themselves, so their lives are quite stable. However, Zhou Jiangshi lives in Xiao Gengsheng's house, which caused controversy. It was said that Gengsheng had an affair with his cousin. Dongchen learned of this and rushed to his brother's house with a rope, demanding to know why he was so shameless and committed incest. Gengsheng asked him who had told him this. Dongchen said it was Fei Keguang, a Siyang person in the company. Gengsheng vehemently denied it, but could not quell Dongchen's anger. Dongchen then made a loop with the rope, saying that they should both put their heads in the loop and die together, to apologize to their ancestors. But Gengsheng refused, so a major conflict occurred. Later, neighbors intervened and dispersed them. The next day, Dongchen wrote a letter to Gengsheng, saying, "You beast, be careful!" Gengsheng laughed it off. Then Dongchen told Gengsheng's son, "You can all support yourselves, your father will die sooner or later." His son was frightened and went home to tell his father. They were discussing what to do when, yesterday, Zhou Jiangshi was ridiculed by Xiao Qianshi and others at the factory, so another conflict occurred. When Xiao Gengsheng learned of this, he thought that if things continued like this, not only would his life not be safe, but his reputation would be ruined. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the Third District Police Station and submitted a threatening letter. Considering that the case involved threats and injury, Yi Qianren and Fei Keguang were taken to the police station and transferred to the local court yesterday for investigation.</p>

<h3>Daughter-in-law of Wang Huaisan, Old Comprador of HSBC, Accuses Xi Juxing of Breaching the Contract: Wang and Xi Originally Had a Partnership Agreement; Xi's Profits as a Comprador Were Shared with the Wang Family; After Gong Ziyu Took Over, the Rights Were Suddenly Terminated; Wang's Daughter-in-law Now Sues for the Settlement of Accounts Before and After</h3>
<p>Wang Huaisan, the first comprador of HSBC on the Bund, was from Yuyao, Zhejiang. At the beginning of the bank's establishment, Wang's planning and design made great contributions. The bank's shareholders highly relied on him. When Wang was old and weak, he partnered with Xi Zhengfu in the position of comprador. At that time, a partnership agreement was signed. Wang retired to his hometown, rarely asking about matters, but because of the partnership agreement, he could still sit back and receive profits from the business. The agreement stated that Xi would manage the affairs, and each month, after expenses, Wang could receive four shares of the profits, and Xi would receive six shares. The required security deposit of 20,000 taels was solely paid by Wang. The witnesses to the agreement were Xie Yuzhai and Shen Zuobin, etc. Later, Wang Huaisan passed away, and his son, Guo Bao, also known as Qiqing, inherited everything. Guo Bao passed away in the 25th year of the Guangxu reign, and his wife, Hu, inherited the family affairs and gave birth to sons such as Yiqiu. Since Xi Zhengfu took over as the HSBC comprador, his business was successful, accumulating assets of more than two million. After Xi Zhengfu passed away, his heirs were the current Li'an Bank comprador Xi Juxing. However, the position of HSBC comprador was then inherited by Xi Lusheng. Later, Xi Lusheng was kidnapped and shot in front of a Yizhixiang. The position of comprador was then inherited by the current HSBC comprador Gong Ziyu. Gong just took over this year, but the rights and obligations of the contract between Wang Huaisan and Xi Zhengfu were not interrupted. In recent years, it was suddenly terminated. Wang Hu entrusted lawyer Hu Jue to send a letter to Xi, urging him to settle the accounts. After receiving the letter, Xi said that when Xi Zhengfu passed away, all the inheritance and debts were cleared by the accountant appointed by the former Mixed Court, and why was there no claim at that time, and it was only mentioned now. The exchange of letters between the two sides could not be resolved. Wang Hu entrusted lawyer Hu Jue to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Xi of violating the partnership agreement and requesting the delivery of accounts for settlement. The reasons for the lawsuit roughly stated that Wang Huaisan, Wang Hu's late father-in-law, had served as the manager of Feng for many years during the Tongzhi reign. After negotiating with the shareholders and agreeing, he invited the defendant's deceased father, Xi Zhengfu, to jointly operate the business and signed a contract. After Xi Zhengfu passed away, his brother Xi Ligong inherited the position. After Ligong passed away, his nephew Lusheng inherited the position. After Lusheng passed away, he did not ask the plaintiff to terminate the contract, but transferred the business to Gong Ziyu to take over, which was obviously in violation of the contract. Moreover, the plaintiff's late father-in-law had paid a security deposit of 20,000 taels, and the profits that should have been received over the years have not been handed over for settlement. Therefore, it is requested that the defendant be ordered to hand over all partnership accounts, rights, and obligations for settlement, etc. Yesterday morning, it was the time for the trial of the case. Wang Hu also included Xi Mingjiu, Xi Jiwen, Xi Lusheng's wife, Xi Jianhou, Xi Debing, Xi Boyu, etc. as defendants because they were all heirs of Xi Zhengfu. Because the summons of all the defendants in this case had not been fully served, the trial was adjourned to the morning of the 30th of this month. As for Xi Juxing, lawyer Wu Linkun was commissioned to appear in court yesterday and stated that Xi Juxing had never been an HSBC comprador, so he was not responsible for this matter. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Hu Jue, said that there was still evidence to be presented in this case, and it would be presented to the court next time.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Awards Certificates for the National Silk Exhibition: A Total of Fifty-Eight First-Class Certificates</h3>
<p>The award ceremony for the Chinese National Silk Exhibition was held at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday in the Standing Meeting Room on the third floor of the City Chamber of Commerce. Those present included Mayor Wu's representative Yu Hongjun, Wang Xiaolai, Luo Qinghua, Lu Zhengbing, Wang Jie'an, Gao Shiheng, Wang Baotai, Tu Zhongying, Chen Jingxuan, Zhu Boyuan, and more than 200 representatives from various silk factories. The ceremony was held as scheduled. First, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening speech, which roughly stated that although 58 factories received first-class certificates at today's award ceremony, we cannot be optimistic. In recent years, foreign goods have been dumped, and domestic silk has plummeted. If we do not seek relief methods, promote it, and revitalize it, the future will be even more unimaginable. I hope that the representatives present today will not be complacent because of this. From now on, we should pay more attention to domestic silk, carefully study it, and work hard to improve it, so that our country's inherent special products can be permanently preserved. Then, Luo Qinghua, the director of the preparatory committee of the association, reported the income and expenditure accounts, which roughly stated that because the budgeted amount for this exhibition was too small at the time, although various uses were made to economize as much as possible, the result was that only 4,650 yuan was received from various donations, and the expenditure was about 5,800 yuan. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there was a shortfall of more than 1,000 yuan. It was resolved by the previous committee that all the insufficient funds should be shared equally by the participating silk factories. Finally, Mayor Wu's representative, Yu Hongjun, gave awards and delivered a speech (the speech is not recorded). A total of 58 first-class certificates issued by the Ministry of Industry and 245 thank-you certificates were issued. After the awards were presented, the guests took photos and had refreshments. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Charity Association Sends Personnel to Nanhui for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Charity Association received an urgent telegram from the Nanhui County Government the day before yesterday, which said: (To Mr. Sun Yishan and Wang Qinbo of the Shanghai South Charity Association, your letter is received with respect. The 500 bags of Bai Xian rice from the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee have arrived, which is far from enough. Please send 200 shi of rice as soon as possible, and hire a boat to send it to the Zhujiao Town Office in the Second District for counting and distribution as soon as possible in order to continue the relief efforts. Sincerely, Yuan Xiluo, true seal.) After receiving the telegram, the association immediately rushed to prepare hundreds of bags of Jiangxi machine-milled white rice. Today, it sent He Genquan's boat to transport 200 bags to the disaster area first, and sent directors Zhu Yunchang, Wang Qinbo, Sun Yishan, and relief personnel to rush to the disaster area to investigate and distribute the rice.</p>
<h3>Under Construction: The Magnificent Jincheng Cinema with Numerous Seats</h3>
<p>The Jincheng Cinema is solely funded by the brothers Zhongliang and Zhonghao, sons of the late wealthy merchant Liu Yutang. The cinema is located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, across from the Beijing Theater. The architecture is magnificent, and the equipment is complete. Everything is rich in modernization and artistry, comparable to the most famous cinemas in Europe and the United States. The number of seats is unparalleled in Shanghai. The founders, the Liu brothers, have been serving in the film industry for many years and have extremely rich experience. For example, the World Theater in Beijing is operated by the Liu family. This time, because they realized that the Shanghai film industry is half controlled by foreign capital and the rights and interests are flowing out, which is truly disheartening, they specially invested heavily in Shanghai to create this cinema. This towering building is currently under construction and will open soon. In the future, it will exclusively screen first-class Chinese and foreign films to entertain the people of Shanghai. It is also heard that the Liu family attaches great importance to the staff that interacts with audiences. Although some people have introduced and recommended people for the positions of ticket seller and candy department, Liu values talent and experience above all else, so they are still in the process of selecting candidates. Those who feel that they have this experience can directly contact Renyong Trading Company on the upper floor of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, No. 800 Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>Shandong to Open a National Goods Exhibition: Letter to Shanghai Asking for Assistance in Collecting Exhibits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall sent a letter to the four national goods organizations yesterday, saying: "The Shandong National Goods Exhibition Hall sent a letter stating that our hall is preparing to hold the third National Goods Exhibition. We have previously sent a letter asking for assistance in collecting exhibits in Shanghai. Now that the exhibition period is approaching, please urge the exhibitors to pack and transport the exhibits as soon as possible for display, etc." The hall has checked that this case was previously transferred by the Social Bureau for assistance in collecting exhibits, etc. We have sent a letter asking your association and the City Chamber of Commerce to lead manufacturers in various industries to enthusiastically respond to the call for exhibits, jointly produce exhibits, and send them directly to participate in the exhibition. Now, in accordance with the previous request, we hereby inform you to check and handle it quickly to promote it.</p>
<h3>The Family Industry Society Invites Su Shaoqing to Broadcast a Peking Opera Lecture</h3>
<p>Drama is a comprehensive art, the sustenance of the national spirit. Therefore, each country has its own independent drama. There are two major categories of old dramas in our country: Kunqu and Pi Huang (i.e., Peking Opera). Kunqu's language is elegant and beautiful, but it is not suitable for modern times, so we will put it aside for the time being. Pi Huang inherits Kunqu's legacy and has a popular effect. Its language is vernacular, its stories come from novels, its themes are simple, and its descriptions are detailed. Like Bai Juyi's poems, even old women can understand them. Therefore, after more than a hundred years of brewing, it has become the center of drama. Its arrangement of scenes, changes in tunes, concatenation of sentences, names of tempos, enunciation of words, and accompaniment of music all have methods and principles inherent in them. As for the singing, acting, voice, and appearance of each role and each school, they all have their own unique advantages. Without explanation, they are often ignored. If we can use the radio to lecture and sing, so that the people of the country can hear it and gradually enter the door, then interest will inevitably arise, which would be a great thing. The Family Industry Society, based on the purpose of serving the community, has specially organized a club. All things that can entertain the public and explore art will be held in order. Now, we will first establish a Peking Opera lecture, and hire the Peking Opera master Su Shaoqing to be in charge of it. It is scheduled to be broadcast on Yongsheng Radio from November 1st, and plans to compile lecture notes for research. All detailed methods will be published in this newspaper later. The matter is just starting, so it is happy to record it.</p>
<h3>Qian Shaofeng Killed His Father's Enemy with His Own Hands: He Zunfu Died of Serious Injuries: Designated as Local Despot Qian Bin Was Killed: Narrow Road for Enemies, They Met in Shanghai</h3>
<p>He Zunfu, from Guizhou, is 36 years old. He previously served in the Southwest 25th Army and concurrently served as the magistrate of An'nan County, Guizhou. While in office, he designated Qian Bin, a resident of An'nan County, as a local tyrant and gentry. After arresting and extorting him unsuccessfully, he killed Qian. Recently, He resigned and had nothing to do. In August of this year, he came to Shanghai with his servant Tian Guixiang, and lived in the Datong Apartment at No. 33 Daode Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, for more than two months. Qian Bin's son, Shaofeng (also known as Peihao), who is now 20 years old, is currently studying at a university in Shanghai. Half a month ago, He Zunfu was walking on Aiduya Road when he was met by Qian Bin's son, Shaofeng. Enemies met on a narrow road, extremely angry. At that time, Qian had no weapons to avenge the murder of his father. So, he secretly followed He's tracks and learned that he lived in the Datong Apartment. He guarded the Datong area day and night, carrying a sharp weapon, and followed He whenever he went out. Qian had no opportunity to act. Until 9 o'clock the night before last (16th), He and his friend Li Yibai went to the Huangjin Grand Theater in Baxianqiao to watch a movie. Qian followed behind and saw He and others enter the main hall downstairs of the cinema. Qian also bought a ticket and sat in the row right behind He. At 10:15, during the intermission of the movie, when the whole place was dark after the movie resumed playing, Qian took out a triangular pointed knife from his sleeve and stabbed He in the abdomen twice, and then stabbed his left shoulder and right hand once each. He screamed in pain, and the audience was in an uproar. Qian abandoned his murder weapon and ran out. At that time, the cinema was in chaos due to the disruption of order, the movie was stopped, and the lights were turned on. The doorman and the patrolmen sent by the police station heard the sound and rushed over. They saw a young man in a student uniform running out in a hurry, so they detained him and brought him into the police station. After questioning, he confessed his name and age, admitting that he killed He to avenge his father, etc. The police chief ordered him to be detained, and immediately sent a Chinese detective from No. 15 to rush to the cinema and send the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment. The cinema was restored to its original state. After the show ended, a teahouse worker found a murder weapon under the fourth row of chairs in the hall and sent it to the police station. At 11 o'clock yesterday morning, Qian was escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi clarified the case, and stated that the victim was being treated in the hospital, and his injuries were not serious, but he could not be present in court today, and the police still needed to investigate the defendant. It was requested that the hearing be postponed until the victim recovered and the case was clarified. Qian Shaofeng was questioned, and he confessed that the victim was the person who killed his father. He didn't know he had come to Shanghai before. Half a month ago, he met him on the road, followed him, and found out that he was living in the Datong Apartment. When he was an official in An'nan County, he designated my father as a local tyrant and gentry, arrested him, and after unsuccessfully extorting him, he killed my father on charges of resisting orders and various illegal acts. The judge asked, "Why didn't you appeal to the superiors at that time?" He replied, "At that time, under their evil power, there was no way." The judge said, "You are killing him now. Do you know that you are breaking the law?" He replied, "I also have no choice but to kill him, one is to avenge my father's private revenge, and the other is to seek justice for the people of An'nan County." The court verified the confession, and ordered that the hearing be postponed to the 26th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody, and the detective in charge of this case was ordered to come to the court the next day (today) to be accompanied by a forensic doctor to the hospital to examine the victim's injuries. However, the victim, He Zunfu, died at 3:50 p.m. yesterday in the hospital due to excessive blood loss and ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police, and the police sent the body cart to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall morgue to examine the body, and waited for the court to send someone to examine the body this morning. The family of the deceased is still in Guizhou, and his servant has sent a telegram to inform them.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company Implements Expansion Plan: New Record in the Second Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company, located across from the Hongmiao on Nanjing Road in this city, for the purpose of vigorously developing the business of national goods, after organizing a business development committee in August, formulated an expansion plan and began implementing it on September 1st. The total business volume of the first month created a new record that surpassed any month of this year, and exceeded the total of August by four times. This has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Now, it is heard that the business volume of the second month (October) has a trend of rapid progress. The daily total of the second month's business, October 8th, has created a new record that surpasses any day of this year. In terms of weekly statistics, the total of the second week of October has also won the position of the highest weekly record. The reason is that the company's goods are exquisite, and all compatriots who love to use national goods are vying to buy them. The company has always taken promoting national goods as its mission, and to promote national goods, it is necessary to first correct the psychology of Chinese people in cities who love to use national goods, and then popularize it in poor rural areas, so that it will become a fashion.</p>
<h3>Gambling on Cricket Fights and Taking Commissions:纨绔Young Masters Are Very Interested: More Than Thirty People Detained</h3>
<p>At 7 o'clock the night before last, Shen Zhenhua, the head of the first sub-office of the second district, received a secret report that someone was organizing a cricket fighting arena inside No. 1 Heping Lane, Jiumudi, and recruiting people to gamble on cricket fights and taking commissions for profit. Specifically, at 7 o'clock the night before last, Officer Hong led police chief Gao Kui, police officer Mu Zhenjiang, and others, secretly went to the place. When they arrived, the cricket insertion arena was in full swing, gambling on cricket fights, with considerable wins and losses. All the gamblers were mostly playboy youngsters. They immediately blocked the front and back doors. As a result, they arrested more than 30 people including Zhang Asheng, and seized a large number of cricket pots, bamboo sticks, bamboo tubes, silver coins, etc. They hired two moving trucks and escorted them all to the office for investigation. After questioning by Director Shen, the defendants all confessed to occasionally playing crickets and did not admit to being the leaders or taking commissions, etc. The case is related to the prohibited cases, and they will be jointly presented to the headquarters for legal action.</p>

<h3>廣東同鄕會董事會</h3>
<p>Guangdong Native Place Association Board of Directors Meeting</p>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Native Place Association held its eighth board of directors meeting yesterday at the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office on Xinzha Road. The directors present included Chen Fengyuan, Tang Haian, Guo Shun, Yang Meinan, Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao (representing), Wu Chengyu, Zheng Zhengqiu, Mai Zuoheng, Chen Qifen, and others. The supervisors present included Huang Tianqu, Gao Chengyuan, Wu Jiangleng, a doctor from the Ji’e Hospital, and others. Tang Haian chaired the meeting and reported on the following matters: (1) Chairman Tang reported that a property on Dongbao Xing Road had been purchased for 29,000 yuan to serve as the site for the Guangdong People's Hospital and a property at No. 32 Gaonaiyi Road had been purchased for over 74,000 yuan to serve as the association's headquarters. The original intention was to find a site in the Hongkou area, but after surveying more than 20 locations, the price of each mu of land was over 100,000 taels. The current funds raised are not sufficient for the land price, let alone the construction. They had to purchase a property in the French Concession first, and relocate later when sufficient funds are raised, to avoid the long-term storage and dispersal of donated funds, and to respect the intentions of the donors. Even this simple approach still requires more than 30,000 yuan. He hoped that fellow countrymen would work hard to donate and help complete this project. (2) A letter from the Guang Zhao Public Office stated that it had no further funds to donate to the association's fund. The discussion items were: (1) Chairman Tang proposed that a certain number of people should be appointed to sign the contracts for the purchase of the association's headquarters and hospital. It was resolved to nominate Yang Meinan, Wu Tiecheng, Tang Haian, Mai Zuoheng, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Director Wang to sign. (2) The Guangdong People's Hospital requested 3,000 yuan to purchase additional medical equipment. It was resolved to allocate the funds as requested. (3) Director Chen Qifen proposed that each director and supervisor should donate 100 yuan per year to the Guangdong People's Hospital. It was resolved to approve the proposal. (4) Director Wu Chengyu proposed that lawyer Gao Yuan, who is well-versed in law and has extensive experience, and who previously served as the general affairs secretary in the preparatory committee, taking charge of the appeals and working diligently, should be hired by the association as a legal advisor to provide assistance and facilitate consultations. It was resolved to hire him as proposed. (5) Director Weng Ziguang introduced the situation of Yihocang Sugar Company's Chenshu earth sugar being detained. It was resolved that the association would forward the case to the National Government and the Ministry of Finance to seek exemption. (6) Dr. Wu Jingyao came to the meeting to explain the treatment of Zheng Yueqin, and Dr. Chen Daming accused her of performing illegal abortions, which was a deliberate slander. She requested a clear investigation. It was resolved to nominate Directors Chen Fengyuan, Xi Guan Sheng, and Dr. Wu Jiangleng to conduct a fair investigation first and then report back for further action. The meeting adjourned at 8 pm.</p>

<h3>好有一比</h3>
<p>Apt Simile</p>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In recent times, there have been a few eccentrics whose published remarks always contain a metaphorical explanation, just like Wang Haobi in my humble work "The Four Eccentrics." They remain silent until they speak, and when they do, it's always "there's an apt simile," "there's an apt simile."</p>
<p>Mussolini stated in the Italian Parliament, "Peace treaties are not permanently valid because the world is not static. Nations have life, growth, aging, and even death. Hoping that peace treaties are permanently valid is akin to turning all countries in the world into zombies."</p>
<p>I examined his words for a moment. His theory is correct. No good law should be immutable. Good laws require people to abide by them. An old Chinese saying goes, "There are men who govern, but no laws that govern." Laws are dead, people are alive. "A dead shop can be run by a living person." Dead laws must also be maintained by living people. The principle of Mussolini's words is undeniable, but his argument may inevitably lead to abuses. He believes that only if a country becomes a zombie can a peace treaty be permanently valid. To put it simply, he doesn't want peace treaties. Imagine that even now, amidst the high praise of peace, the world cannot escape the danger of war. If we openly advocate that we don't want peace treaties, what kind of world would it be?</p>
<p>Japanese Army Minister Araki Sadao said, "Japan is like a large and strong stomach that can completely digest Eastern culture and Western culture. This is because the Japanese spirit is free and strong, without any stagnation or obstruction. Anything can be embraced and absorbed."</p>
<p>I also examined his words for a moment. This can express the exaggeration of Japanese militarists. He speaks of culture on the surface, saying that Japan has a strong stomach that can digest all kinds of culture. In fact, he is hinting at something. He is not talking about culture, but seems to be talking about military strength. He believes that Japan has a strong military stomach that can completely digest Eastern lands, Western lands, anything. Those who are gluttonous are called gourmands, so wouldn't they become a gluttonous nation? Foreign Minister Shidehara said, "Japan swallowed Manchuria, like swallowing a bomb." Can Japan's powerful stomach digest bombs? As the saying goes, "Disaster comes from the mouth." An ordinary stomach is not a Qiankun bag. I have seen people lose their lives from gambling on eating soup dumplings, let alone swallowing bombs? I'm afraid this Eastern stomach is a bit unreliable.</p>
<h3>說話美</h3>
<p>The Beauty of Speech</p>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>Speech: It is originally a vanguard of eating; even if the facts are already displaying this, there are those in the world who rely on speaking to achieve instant fame, enjoying high-ranking officials, generous titles, Western-style houses, cars, gold, and beautiful women for no reason; there are also those who, because they cannot speak well, fall from heaven to hell; furthermore, those who are labeled as counter-revolutionaries for not being able to speak well, and those who eat lawsuits and lose their heads for not being able to speak well, are even more commonplace and not surprising!</p>
<p>"Love is natural," so only "beauty" can win people's hearts, which can also be said to be another kind of luck in life. Now everything has to be exquisite and beautiful, even curves have beauty, virgins have beauty, which is the principle. Thus, speech, the most important thing in life, naturally needs to be beautiful. This "beauty of speech" can also be called the "art of speech," but how is speech considered beautiful? That can only be understood tacitly and not expressed in words. Roughly speaking, it is like this:</p>
<p>If the person you are speaking to is higher in rank and wealthier than you, in short: everything is stronger than you, then when you speak, you must insert some idle articles in the middle. These idle articles are also called "flattery." It doesn't matter if it's a little bit nauseating. For example: when saying how charitable someone is, you have to say: like Mr.—the other party—such a enthusiastic and generous person; when saying that someone has done something wrong, you have to say: if Mr.—the other party—had caught up, it would have been very good; when saying that someone's concubine is uneasy, you have to say: if this girl was under Mr.—the other party's—control, she wouldn't dare disobey. Such···things: originally very ordinary, just because these idle articles (flattery) are inserted in, it's like turning stone into gold, beauty is in it. Wouldn't that make the other party feel more pleasant when they hear it?!</p>
<p>If you are talking to someone who is not as good as you, you should not use flattery, but should use "exaggeration." For example: when you should relay a sentence, you have to say that Director X told me yesterday: When commenting on something, you have to say that I saw something better at Minister X's house at the last dinner, ···In this way, it will naturally be sensational, and everyone will think you are an amazing person.</p>
<p>Other examples: for women, for friends, and even for family members, wives, and children, no matter what you say, you must adapt to the occasion, add icing on the cake, and make it completely beautiful,···divine it and brighten it, it exists in the person.</p>
<p>If the "beauty of speech" is achieved, the problem of eating will be invincible!</p>
<h3>私與公</h3>
<p>Private and Public</p>
<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>One day in Suzhou, I was wandering alone in the neighborhood when I suddenly saw a group of people approaching. I stopped to watch. In the crowd was a police officer leading an old man selling pens. A man in a summer cloth gown, raising his voice and gesticulating wildly at the officer, said that the county magistrate and the branch director were all close friends he met with every day. I heard his tone and knew he must be someone important, so I wanted to follow along and see what was happening. When we arrived at the second police station in Fu Langzhong Alley, the officer first reported the facts to the police official, and then the police official questioned them. It turned out that the man was a party affairs officer. When the old man tried to sell him pens, he became inexplicably angry, and without asking the reason, raised his hand and hit the old man, knocking all his pens to the ground. He even threatened to send the old man to court. The old man, not willing to give in, had two pens knocked out of his hands, so everyone went to the police station to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>The word "party" is enough to scare people, let alone having the county magistrate and branch director as close friends. Sending an old pen seller to court is naturally commonplace. Using the authority of the party to punish a poor old man is a great disrespect to the word "party." The party is above all else, and the word "party" must be respected. In my opinion, it is nothing more than exercising his "private" authority.</p>
<p>The old man selling pens had two pens knocked out of his hands and insisted on compensation. With a small business, he naturally couldn't afford to lose. But this gentleman refused to pay, only concerned with showing off his big sign, wanting the police officer to protect him. Unexpectedly, the officer who had just reported the facts suddenly said sternly, "If he doesn't compensate for these two pens, I won't be a police officer anymore. Public affairs cannot be handled fairly, and nothing will go well." I was invigorated by these words. Even the officer understood the word "public" and was even willing to resign, which was admirable and made people feel respect. This gentleman, who everywhere handles affairs publicly, did not treat public as public, but treated public as private. No wonder he only wanted to use a sign and do whatever he wanted, without regard for the law.</p>
<p>The four characters "The world is for the public" are hung in the center of all government offices, courts, and other institutions, so official and grand. But whether the world is for the public is, as they say, "unspeakable." We ordinary people can only pretend to be deaf and dumb, otherwise we will only get angry.</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast Army</p>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>From Chapter 17: Who Can Be Without Emotion? The Family Thinks and Sighs. The Air Is Dry and Bitter. War Is Never Wrong. Brave Words Strengthen Military Morale.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang could only manage a wry smile, shaking his head slightly, saying: We basically can't be called heroes, what heroic spirit is there? Have you gone into the city? Tian Qing shook his head, sighing: A platoon leader took leave, and the sergeant also went out. How can I leave? Going into the city is not like Shanghai, it's only a few hours round trip. I've accepted it, Zhao Ziqiang said: You say you can't go into the city, but I can't go to Haidian either. Tian Qing said: Don't you have two hours? Isn't that enough for a round trip? Within these two hours, I think you can always find a way. Zhao Ziqiang said: Your company only lost a platoon leader, but my company lost two platoon leaders. This is also your phrase, I've accepted it. Tian Qing looked back, and asked him in a low voice: Hey! Old Zhao, do you know where we're going this time? Zhao Ziqiang said: I think the decision is to go to the Northeast. Anyway, we can't go southwest. Tian Qing said: I heard we're going to Jioumenkou. If we don't fight the Japanese, that's fine, but if we fight the Japanese, we'll be on the front line. Zhao Ziqiang also looked back, and said in a low voice: We're only talking among ourselves here. When it comes to combat power, we're really not very good. Why don't they send some better troops up there? Tian Qing said: Maybe we're not going to Jioumenkou. Zhao Ziqiang said: I'll bet you, we're definitely going out of the Great Wall. Tian Qing laughed: Why are we panicking blindly? If we're going to Jioumenkou, we can't back down just because we're afraid. If we're not going to Jioumenkou, we shouldn't think of it as good fortune. I'm most afraid of hearing that sentence, that our Northeast Army is a non-resistant army. You're not from the Northeast, so that's a little better. I'm from the Northeast, and I'm wearing this gray uniform. As soon as I open my mouth and speak Fengtian dialect, people stare at me with wide eyes. Even if they don't say anything, I understand in my heart, isn't that what they're saying, what's the use of you Northeast soldiers? You can't even guard your own home. Zhao Ziqiang smiled, and gave a thumbs up, saying: Ha! You really have guts, you even argue about this. (215)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Ah Guan</h3>
<p>— Yang Yu Sheng</p>
<p>As soon as he crawled out of his mother's womb, his father gave him a name: Ah Guan.</p>
<p>Yes, his father hoped he would become an official in the future, and his mother added a "more" to that hope. Even the spirits of seventeen or eighteen generations of ancestors in heaven hoped he would become an official. Ah Guan's future is probably set to be that of an official!</p>
<p>Strange, this little soul, not yet a year old, when you reach out to tease him and make him laugh, calling out his name in a drawn-out tone, "Ah...Guan...", he would wave his hands and smile at you, jump, and even babble. It seems that Ah Guan himself also hopes to become an official in the future. Hmm, this is called a womb sickness!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Ah Guan grew up and went to kindergarten. After a few years, he entered primary school, then jumped out of middle school. Old Woman Wang from next door, intentionally or unintentionally, often praised her "Third Girl's" good fortune in front of his mother, saying that she would definitely become an official's wife in the future. So his parents also thought about the need to "have a grandson." After all, Ah Guan was almost certain to become an official, but an official's wife had to be reserved earlier!</p>
<p>Whether it was Ah Guan's ambition or his high standards, he rejected all the nagging he should have received from his parents and ran to this wild chicken university that welcomes all comers. He knew, just like his father knew, that without going to university, he wouldn't be qualified to become an official. His father, of course, had no objections, but his mother grumbled for a few days, saying that Ah Guan had been led astray by the "old soft-shelled turtle."</p>
<p>Ah Guan felt everything was fresh when he first entered university. In his middle school days, although he had chewed peanuts by the school gate, lay on the playground commenting on classmates' sisters, secretly lit foreign candles to read countless improper novels, and hoarsely shouted "Pass:::Pass" every time there was an exam; it was interesting enough at that time. But once he stepped into university, these seemed childish and laughable! He felt that school life, especially university, was not as boring and dull as imagined; happiness had to be pursued by oneself! So he made a lot of jokes, especially the comedies or tragedies he played in front of girls, which made people laugh until their stomachs hurt when they talked about them!</p>
<p>Although Ah Guan's inner talent was a mess, his external talents were indeed quite high. He could kick a few footballs. Although track and field wasn't great, he could still handle it. Perhaps it was by relying on the athlete's reputation that he muddled through four years and somehow graduated!</p>
<p>Ah Guan put on a "heavenly official's hat," draped himself in a "Taoist robe," and wanted to experience the "official addiction" as soon as he stepped into society. His parents had previously thought it was almost certain, but unexpectedly, he encountered "fake goods" nails everywhere!</p>
<p>"Those of us who have eaten bread can't even find a job, what are you?" Ah Guan often heard this kind of ridicule. He didn't care, but his father was very angry. In a fit of anger, he sold the fields and property to send Ah Guan abroad. His mother cried and fussed several times, saying that the money for marrying a wife had been spent, and the "Third Girl" didn't like that "foreign accent."</p>
<p>Ah Guan initially planned to go to Tokyo, but later heard that "Japanese goods" weren't worth much, so he changed his plan and sneaked to the West. When he first arrived in the United States, a fellow villager ran to his residence to see him and started with an English sentence, "How do you do?" Ah Guan hesitated for a moment and replied, "I do nothing." So Ah Guan became famous for this! In fact, Ah Guan didn't lie, he was indeed "staying" but not "studying" in the United States, practicing his "I do nothing" principle!</p>
<p>Although Ah Guan made many jokes in the United States, he gradually rarely heard jokes like "I do nothing" in the "wine bar." Of course, our Ah Guan is constantly improving!</p>
<p>I don't know what caused it, but "Ah Guan stayed in the New World for about a year and a half, and quietly packed his bags and returned home. Some said it was because of a love affair, others said he was expelled from school—but no one seemed to know in detail what school Ah Guan attended and what he studied.</p>
<p>One evening in the spring of 1931, someone saw Ah Guan in the French Park, wearing a round thing on his chest, looking very proud. It is said that he was accompanied by a young woman. How about that! I said Ah Guan will definitely be famous in the future, but who is that woman? Probably not the "Third Girl"!</p>

As a result, spot goods fell by 45 pounds, and futures fell by 40 to 48 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot goods were unchanged, and futures fell by 34 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market was weak at the opening, but later rebounded due to gold relations and a few speculators buying. As a result, both Pingar Bai Luoxi fell by one and a half Robbie, and Oumla fell by one Robbie and seven and a half corners. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Grain Prices: Rice Sales Listless, Drop Another Twenty Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources indicate over fifty firms. The market situation, after yesterday's sideways price drop, continues to be affected today. The main reason is that arrivals are still abundant, and sales are sluggish. Guest brokers only took in six to seven hundred bags of kiln rice, and over two hundred bags of broken rice. Consequently, the price of new kiln-grade Baek Ge rice from various brokers continues to fall by ten to twenty cents, and broken rice also drops by twenty cents. New Du Yang and other Jiangsu rice from the same brokers, due to better routes, have been able to stabilize. Other varieties like Qing Jiao and Feng Lian rice still drop by about ten cents. Sales of new Yin Yuan rice are not widespread, dropping another ten cents or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over forty boats arrived from various routes along the river. Market sales are still active. Except for minor fluctuations in the price of broken rice and new Du Jian rice, the price of West Xin rice and Bo Dao rice has decreased by twenty to thirty cents. Bai Yuan Yang Jian rice has also decreased by a small amount of twenty cents. The price of new kiln-grown Baek Ge rice has fallen by forty to fifty cents. There have been slight fluctuations in the prices of port Jian and guest Jian rice.</p>
<h3>Futures: Flour and Wheat Drop Sharply, Then Slightly Recover</h3>
<p>After the market opened this morning, all months in the flour market continued to show signs of declining prices. Regarding the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by another $1.67, and Canada fell by around twenty to thirty cents. Therefore, after the market opened, sentiment was naturally depressed. This month's opening price was immediately two yuan and one cent lower, and the prices for all distant months also fell by varying amounts of one to two cents compared to the previous day. However, the market had fallen to such a low point that there was virtually no room for further decline. Therefore, due to the covering of short positions and the absorption of temporary bulls, sentiment in the near term has stabilized. Distant months remain sluggish due to continued sales from major factories. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially flat. Because factory selling had subsided, and speculative short positions in the market predicted that the price of foreign wheat could temporarily stop falling, all months gradually increased in value. There was also temporary buying, so all months turned from falling to rising. In addition, because of the sharp drop this month, factories now have no separate prices for spot goods and must all draw directly according to the standard. Sentiment has thus rebounded in tandem. As a result, October and November rose by 2.25 cents compared to the previous session, December fell by 1.75 cents, January and February fell by 1.25 cents, and March rose by 1 cent.</p>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning, another huge drop was seen. Regarding the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by another $1.67, and Canada fell by twenty to thirty cents. Therefore, after the opening price, the weakness of sentiment had reached its extreme. This month even fell to 3.61 yuan, November fell to 3.68 yuan, December to 3.70 yuan, January to 7.40 yuan, and February and March to 7.56 yuan, all falling by four, five, or six cents compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially still stable, with only minor fluctuations. Later, as flour futures became popular, buying interest in all months also increased, and due to some short covering, market sentiment also gradually rose. This kind of large drop followed by a small rebound is also common in exchange markets. In the end, only November was better by one cent, December was better by two cents, and there were no changes in the others. Due to the sharp drop in the standard price of raw wheat, factories are also hesitant to take action, fearing that it will be difficult to find buyers without cutting prices by ten to twenty cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated and White Sugar Down by Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the sugar market's margin deposit rose, trading remained thin, and the trend was flat and sluggish. The association set the price of ordinary grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $21.55, a decrease of five cents compared to the previous day. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. The prices for grades 8 and 9 were still set at $16.75 to $16.70. Taikoo sugar was quoted at the original price but no deals were made. The prices for Zhonghua, Guohua, and Zhenji Grade 1 were set at $20.30 at the original price, and other grades retreated. The price of Chaoqing sugar slightly loosened. Over two hundred bags were opened yesterday, with prices ranging from $15.45 to $15.20. Hainan red sugar has not been opened for a long time. Yesterday's quotes were $15.50 to $15.60, but no deals were made. According to telegraphs from Shantou, although Chaoqing sugar had a slight drop a few days ago, it has now rebounded, and inventories are low, so it is feared that it will be difficult to fall significantly.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Arrivals of New Dried Longan from Tong'an Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Arrivals of newly sun-dried longan pulp have been scarce recently, and local prices are extremely high. A small number of brand new, high-quality goods from Tong'an were opened yesterday, with a price of $75. It is heard that local prices for goods from Shima have risen too high, and there are very few direct purchases. Therefore, according to recent news, the price of dried hawthorn has loosened, differing by nearly ten yuan from the highest price. However, quotations still require around one hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil Shows Slight Turnaround</h3>
<p>Since the Hanshi white tung oil was sold off by foreign firms at $25 per picul, it then continued to fall to $24.40. It was assumed that the market would have no chance of recovery as foreign firms stopped trading. However, according to a detailed letter from Hankou yesterday, foreign exchanges suddenly started up, with over a hundred tons transacted at a price of $25.10, followed by another fifty to sixty tons transacted at $25.20. Dealers have also increased the price of Xiang tung oil shipped in to $20.05 to $20.06, so the market situation has slightly turned around. This shows that market changes are beyond the prediction of ordinary people. Local firms have not paid much attention because sales have dwindled. Zhejiang tung oil inventories are low, and Hangzhou firms are unwilling to sell too cheaply. The new crop is still a month away. Generally speaking, there will be no major changes in the Zhejiang route before the new oil comes out.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Demand for Lower-Grade Zhigong Cloth Remains High, Shortages Persist</h3>
<p>Lower-grade Guangjing Yuanqing Zhigong woolen fabric continues to be extremely popular, and there are still many customers. Because the cost of new goods is high, those who have the ability to sell are all searching for spot goods on the market. Inventories are extremely scarce. Currently, the cheapest double-sided Yuan Shi Zhigong woolen fabric is the spot goods offered by the former Ningfeng firm, which are wholesale-sold by Huafu Tai, Chengda, and Xinchang at $5.25 per yard (according to Ningfeng's writing, only $4.70). It is found that most of the other lower-grade Zhigong has been sold out. Ordinary single-sided Zhigong sells for $3.875 per yard.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Sheet Sales Lively</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the gradual arrival of cold weather, Northbound guest brokers are rushing to purchase black iron sheet, so sales have been good for several days, and prices have been rising. Currently, 2-foot by 6-foot 18-sheet goods are selling for $11.80 per picul, an increase of 15 cents compared to before. 3-foot by 6-foot goods are estimated at $11.25, and the local enamel factories also have a very active appetite, so market transactions are quite lively. It is found that over four to five hundred piculs were sold yesterday. However, since the goods on the market have been purchased, they are very scarce, and there is still a possibility that the market will be good.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Piculs of English Galvanized Iron Newly Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 1,600 piculs of thick and thin English galvanized iron arrived at the New Taikoo Wharf. From now on, the market will have a supply of scattered and broken pieces of sizes 26 and 28, so there is no worry about shortages. Currently, 6-foot sheets are selling for $1.17 per sheet, 7-foot sheets for $1.38, 28-gauge sheets for $17.50, 26-gauge sheets for $16.50, and 24-gauge sheets for $25.50. It is heard that over two hundred piculs were sold off yesterday.</p>

<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) Before the swimming competition, male athletes each possessed colorful bathrobes to ward off the cold. The weather was overcast and the wind was blowing, so it was not advisable to enter the water. Among them, Hong Kong female athlete Yang Xiuqiong and Beijing male athlete Wang Yusheng suffered the most after the battle. Their muscles could not move, which worried the spectators. After the competition, they went to the pool and were in high spirits again. In the afternoon swimming competition, Chairman Lin of the National Government sat on the press seat with a large black coat, showing great interest in swimming. After the completion of each program, he said to Hao Gengsheng: "You have been busy these days, it is a pity that I cannot help you." Among today's swimming events, the women's 100-meter backstroke final was the most exciting for the audience. After the athletes entered the water, the applause of the audience never stopped. After the competition, the first, second, and third places were all taken by Hong Kong. The photographers rushed to take a group photo of the three Hong Kong female athletes. Hong Kong female athlete Liang Yongxian was full of rouge and powder, with red clouds on her cheeks. After the competition, getting out of the pool, she felt more refreshing and lively, and even more beautiful than before entering the pool. Every day, the swimming pool is full. Latecomers are limited by the fact that the organizing committee sells out 2,500 tickets each morning and afternoon, so they cannot enter the venue. A message to the audience: If you want to visit the swimming, you should book tickets in advance at the Shanghai Bank to avoid futile trips.</p>

<p>| Shanghai and Guangdong to Compete for the Championship Tomorrow |</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) It was not easy for Shanghai to defeat Hong Kong, and Guangdong also had a hard time defeating Hebei. Tomorrow Shanghai and Guangdong will compete against each other. It is still difficult to predict whether the championship will belong to Shanghai or Guangdong, but it will definitely be one of the most thrilling and eye-catching scenes of the National Games.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Defeats Hebei</h3>
<p>▲ Result: Four to One</p>
<p>Football Semi-Final: Guangdong Wins Over Hebei. On the 17th, at 2:00 PM, the football semi-final was held at the stadium. There were over ten thousand spectators. Many important figures such as Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Wang Zhengting, and Chu Minyi attended. The situation was tense. In the first match, Guangdong defeated Hebei 4-1. In the second match, Shanghai defeated Hong Kong 1-0. Guangdong and Shanghai secured a spot in the final, which is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 19th. The football championship will be determined by the fierce competition between the athletes of the two teams from Shanghai and Guangdong. The two teams, the heroes of the South and the good men of the North, competed. Guangdong is known for its lively connections, while Hebei is known for its strength and footwork. Before the competition, the crowd knew that the Guangdong team would win, but they wanted to see how much the Hebei team would work hard to reduce their record. The referee was Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen were Zhou Jiaji and Li Zuqi.</p>
<p>▲ Ye Beihua Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the two teams fought fiercely, with equal strength. There was no winner in five minutes. Guangdong center Zhu Guolun quickly passed the ball to Ye Huabei and Yang Shuiyi. Zhu shot at the goal three times, but the ball flew over the goal each time. At ten minutes, Ye Beihua dribbled the ball into the inner defense line and kicked it forcefully. The ball flew into the net, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Lu Scores to Tie the Game</p>
<p>Before three minutes had passed, Hu Tianbao caught up with a kick, but the ball hit the goalpost and was bounced out. At this point, the Hebei team began to counterattack. The five forwards were like lively dragons and tigers, overwhelming the defense. Li Tiansheng and Mai Su shouted anxiously, but to no avail. Hebei inside forward Zhang Changyu got the ball and passed it to the left. The goalkeeper saw the danger and rushed out to save the ball. Jiang immediately kicked the ball into the net, making the score 1-1.</p>
<p>▲ Ye Beihua Triumphs Again</p>
<p>At this time, the battle became more intense. Zhu Guolun led the heroes and launched attacks, but they were all saved by Chen Erde. The audience shouted "Iron Gate Second." Several corner kicks were taken, but they were unsuccessful. In the third minute, Guangdong right forward Hu Tianbao ran straight with the ball and kicked it to Ye Beihua. The landing was excellent. Ye scored another goal with lightning speed, making the score 2-1 to Guangdong. The Hebei army counterattacked again, but they could not escape Li Tiansheng. They tried their best, but to no avail. Afterwards, both sides had dangerous shots, but none were successful. The first half ended with Guangdong winning 2-1.</p>
<p>▲ Li Ye's Efforts Lead to Complete Success</p>
<p>In the second half, the teams switched sides and fought again. Hebei kicked the ball with the wind. Within five minutes, the Hebei army surrounded the Guangdong goal. Huang Jiliang dived to deflect the ball, managing to save it. After a close battle for twenty minutes, Guangdong's Li Hongqing got an excellent opportunity and kicked the ball, scoring another goal. The Hebei army resisted desperately, and the inside defense was especially diligent. Although Hebei was penalized for five free kicks, they were all kicked out of the goal. In the twenty-eighth minute, Ye Beihua took advantage of the situation and scored another goal, catching Chen Erde off guard. Afterwards, the two sides reached a stalemate. The second half ended with a score of 2-0, for a total score of 4-2. Guangdong won. The Hebei goalkeeper was an experienced veteran. He had been a goalkeeper in the Tianjin team and had rich experience. His performance in this game was also excellent, and Chen was the best performer.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong</h3>
<p>▲ Result: One to Zero</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) On the 17th, at 4:00 PM, in the second football semi-final, Shanghai defeated Hong Kong 1-0. The strength of the two teams was about equal. The forward connections were better for the Shanghai team, while the defense was better for the Shanghai team than for the Hong Kong team. Hong Kong used Lin Xuecan as the goalkeeper, and changed the goalkeeper Bao Jiaping to play as a center forward, which was very brave. The Hong Kong team lost a goal in an instant, and lost by only one point, which was very unfortunate. Shanghai defender Li Ningjiang's performance was amazing. Zhou Xianyan saved countless dangerous shots, no less than a dozen times. He waved his fists, kicked his feet, and dived to save the ball, like the green-faced tiger in the White Water Beach opera, winning applause from the audience. Otherwise, the Shanghai team would have undoubtedly lost, and he was definitely the best player in the game.</p>
<p>▲ Flying General Descends from the Sky</p>
<p>Referee He Chunhui blew his silver whistle and the battle began. Shanghai center Li Yichen entered the enemy camp with lightning speed. Liang Xianzhan kicked the ball out, and Xu Yahui caught up and kicked it into the air. Li greeted it head-on, and without waiting for the ball to stop, he headed it into the net, opening the scoring. It was only one minute after the kickoff. Goalkeeper Lin Xuecan thought that the flying general had descended from the sky, and was stunned. The audience applauded and cheered.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Iron Gate Resists the Crowd</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong team suffered an unexpected disaster, they launched a full-scale counterattack. Bao Jiaping led the children, rolling in, and used long-range passes, causing the Shanghai team to run around. Hong Kong right inside forward Huang Meishun got the ball at the twelve-yard box and kicked it desperately, creating an irreversible situation. Zhou Xianyan lunged and saved the ball. Cheers erupted. The two sides continued to fight, back and forth. Cannonball-like flying balls flew uncertainly. The intensity of the battle could be seen. In the fifteenth minute, Huang Meishun attacked again, but the ball was caught by Zhou. Hong Kong's Zheng Jiliang dived straight at Zhou, who could not avoid it and fell to the ground, but the ball was still saved. In the next ten minutes, the Shanghai goal was in a state of extreme tension and crisis. Once, Bao Jiaping kicked the ball, and Huang Meishun attacked twice. The balls were fast and powerful, and were continuously punched out by Zhou Xianyan. This dangerous ball could not have been saved without Zhou. The Hong Kong army failed again and again, and their offensive gradually slowed down. The Shanghai team also returned the favor, but Lin Xuecan was not weak, and could not be easily beaten. The first half ended with Shanghai leading 1-0.</p>
<p>▲ Trying to Counterattack, But Unable to Do So</p>
<p>During the break, the Hong Kong coach repeatedly instructed the team on tactics. In the second half, the teams switched sides and fought again. The Hong Kong army changed its formation, with inside forward Liang Darong replaced by Zheng Jiliang, and Wu Baoju as the left forward and Gan Hui as the right forward. At the beginning of the half, the momentum was different. The balls flew like snowflakes, and Zhou Xianyan's iron gate was calm and composed, blocking and parrying with ease. The Shanghai army took the opportunity to counterattack. Li Yichen shot at the goal but was caught. Sun Jinshun shot two consecutive shots. One shot was caught, and the other hit the right goalpost. The ball bounced back. The difference was only a narrow escape. Before long, Hong Kong was penalized for a series of free kicks, which were taken by Chen Jiaqiu, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Duty Bound, the Strong Man is Injured</h3>
<p>At the twentieth minute, Hong Kong left forward Wu Baoju passed the ball and advanced along the touchline. Jiang Shanjing desperately chased behind him. Between the left corner line, Wu collided violently with Jiang, and Jiang fell to the ground immediately. After the boy scouts rescued him, it was discovered that he was internally injured and could not stand up. He was replaced by Gu Shangxiang. At this point, the Shanghai team switched to a defensive posture, and the defense was extremely tight. Although the Hong Kong army was brave, they could not cross the line. The twilight was dim and time was running out. The Hong Kong army was eager to win, and rushed forward recklessly, but they were flustered and confused. They wanted to achieve their goals quickly, but failed, and were often blocked by Li and others, making them unable to laugh or cry. In the last minute, Li Yichen led the crowd to attack the Hong Kong goal. Sun Jinshun shot the ball obliquely, and Lin Tiancan caught it at the same time as the silver whistle sounded. The match ended, and Shanghai won the semi-final 1-0. They will compete with Guangdong in the football championship final on the 19th. It is not easy to say who will win.</p>

Qiu has long enjoyed a great reputation, but he was played by Xu at his mercy, and was at a complete loss. He lost in three straight sets, with the scores being 3-6, 2-6, and 0-6, and each set had the possibility of being completely lost. It was truly the first time that Qiu had encountered this kind of situation. In the first singles match between Sichuan and Hebei, Sichuan's Lin also won in three straight sets. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Chengji (Basha) (6-3 6-2 6-0) Qiu Feihai (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Lin Baohua (Sichuan) (6-2 6-2 6-1) Tao Shaofu (Hebei)</p>

<h3>Record of the Battle Between Xu and Qiu</h3>
<p>▲ The tennis court was packed with spectators, but the space was narrow. Each court was separated by wire mesh. There was only one side for spectators, which could not accommodate a large crowd. The clash between Xu and Qiu attracted tennis enthusiasts eager to witness the spectacle. After 8:00 AM, spectators arrived one after another, occupying seats, eagerly awaiting the great battle. Latecomers were crammed onto the sidewalks and along the wire mesh, creating a truly packed scene, with the wire mesh at risk of collapsing at any moment. If this match were held in Shanghai, tickets would cost at least two dollars, but here, it only cost ten cents to enjoy the spectacle. No wonder the audience flocked to it like crazy.</p>

<p>▲ Spectators Expel the Referee: Such an important match requires astute and capable referees and linesmen. Unexpectedly, the head referee, Ling Daoyang, disregarded this and only appointed two linesmen. The refereeing duty was assigned to a Mr. Wang, who lacked knowledge and experience. From the beginning, errors abounded. He was clumsy and slow-witted, making the outcome unclear. Both Xu and Qiu were stunned, and the audience erupted in an uproar, shouting insults and demanding a replacement. Mr. Wang blushed crimson but refused to step down, leading to a temporary suspension of the match. Zhang Zizhen, a coach from Shanghai, and Ling Daoyang, the head referee, discussed the situation and decided to replace him and add more linesmen. Mr. Wang reluctantly stepped down, and the match resumed smoothly. This commotion only occurred after two games had been played.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Chengji Displays Outstanding Performance: Xu Chengji, who has a completely childlike face, did not show any special performance in the previous match against Gao Huimin, leading some to believe that Qiu would win. However, yesterday and today were like two different people. From the start, Xu was versatile and skilled, leaving no opening for his opponent. His cannonball-like serves made Qiu unable to retaliate. His thunderous overheads made Qiu feel a sense of hopelessness. Qiu's strokes were not as powerful as Xu's. Xu either used sharp, arrow-like strokes to shoot directly at the baseline, or extremely light soft balls, barely clearing the net, exhausting Qiu and leaving him at a loss. His excellent net play was particularly feared by Qiu. Xu demonstrated his special and superb skills, making the audience smile and applaud continuously. His high-ball smashes, able to kill the ball over the net from the baseline, had not been seen before in the country, and the excellent placement of his attacks was secondary. In short, Xu's technique is truly innovative in China and can be compared to Japan's Jiro Sato. He is a promising young man, and it is hoped that our sports community will value him and strive for overseas glory for the country.</p>
<p>Men's 50-meter freestyle final, second place, Yue Qisong</p>
<p>▲ Qiu Feihai Runs Out of Ideas and Energy: Although Qiu tried his best to cope, he ran out of ideas and energy and could not find a solution. Aggressive strokes were ineffective, and clever tactics yielded few results. If he used high balls to trouble his opponent, it would only give Xu a chance to do whatever he wanted, swinging powerfully and smashing the ball back, leaving no chance for a counterattack. The situation was dire and impossible to handle. Although the spectators shouted themselves hoarse, praising him wildly, it was not enough to exhaust his magical skills. In the end, Qiu only won five games in three sets, which was fortunate, as Qiu was in danger of losing every game and set in this match, making it a major defeat in his life.</p>
<p>▲ Criticism of the Balls Used: The balls used were also a factor in Qiu's defeat. Qiu was used to using Dunlop balls because their elasticity was slow and easier to control. Qiu had contacted Xu beforehand, and the two agreed to use Dunlop balls, but the organizers did not approve and insisted on using the Slazenger balls stipulated by the organizers. This was a big disadvantage for Qiu, while Xu, who hit the ball very quickly, benefited from it. As a result, Qiu was unable to grasp the nature of the ball, and many of his shots went out of bounds due to improper force, which was also the reason for Qiu's major defeat.</p>
<p>▲ The Dream of Final Victory: After obtaining the right to a rematch from Shanghai, the match between Qiu Feihai and Xu Chengji was already in the works. Someone asked Qiu if he could win this time, having lost to Xu twice before in Java. Qiu proudly said, "I have indeed been defeated by Xu twice, but this time, the final victory will belong to me." Although his ambition was great, his wish was difficult to fulfill. In this clash, not only did he fail to win, but he suffered a crushing defeat, and his ambition was unfulfilled, leaving him deeply saddened. However, the emergence of a talented player in our country's tennis community is a cause for joy and celebration. After the National Games close, Xu and Qiu may come to Shanghai to compete again.</p>
<p>▲ The Course of the Two Men's Fierce Battle: Xu and Qiu entered the arena at 9:00 AM and practiced first. The match started soon after. The competition was slightly more intense in the first set. Qiu served first and won the first game, followed by each winning their serve until the score was tied at 3-3. Qiu then failed to serve, and Xu took the lead 3-4. Later, Xu's cannonball-like serves made it difficult for Qiu to parry. Qiu suffered another defeat, and Xu took a commanding lead of 5-3. Finally, Qiu served, hoping to win back a game, but unfortunately, he lost again due to a double fault. Xu won the first set. In the first set, Xu took advantage of the momentum of winning the first set and took five consecutive games. Qiu was in imminent danger of losing the set. Fortunately, he won back his serve and then won Xu's serve, making the score 5-2. Xu led, and everyone thought Qiu might have a chance to turn things around, but in the end, he was defeated due to his slightly inferior skills. Xu won the second set with a score of 6-2. At the beginning of the third set, Qiu was in a slump and completely controlled by Xu. Even his best long baseline shots could not be used. Xu showed his brilliance, played with ease, and made no mistakes. He won six games in a row. Xu won the final victory with a score of 6-3, 6-2, 6-0.</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua Wins Big</h3>
<p>In the first singles match between Sichuan and Hebei, Sichuan sent Lin Baohua, while Hebei used Tao Shaofu, who was ranked fourth. This inevitably involved unfair tactics to create suspense, which was unfavorable to Sichuan. Lin played effortlessly, while Tao's skills were average, and he was too busy defending to think about attacking. As a result, the three sets were completed in just twenty-three games, with Lin winning easily 6-2, 6-2, and 6-1.</p>
<h3>Second Singles</h3>
<p>Starting at 2:00 PM on the 17th, the men's tennis continued with the semi-finals, including two singles and two doubles matches between Shanghai and Pakistan, and Sichuan and Hebei. Pakistan forfeited the doubles match against Shanghai, and Hebei won against Sichuan. In the second singles match, Shanghai won against Pakistan, and Sichuan won against Hebei. Overall, Shanghai and Sichuan each eliminated Pakistan and Hebei with a score of 2-1 and obtained the right to the final. Shanghai and Sichuan will compete in the final on the 19th to determine who will win the championship. The Shanghai team has average talent, and each player has better skills, so there is a 90% chance of winning the championship.</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng Wins Over Lin Xuyin</h3>
<p>The second singles match between Shanghai and Pakistan started at 3:00 PM. Shanghai lost one singles match in the morning, and Pakistan forfeited the doubles match. Therefore, the outcome of the second singles match was crucial, so both sides did their best to win. Shanghai sent Wang Wenzheng to take on this task. His opponent, Lin Xuyin, had excellent skills, but Wang was calm and composed. At the beginning of the first set, Wang showed his talent and won five games in a row, taking a commanding lead of 5-0. However, Wang was very polite and did not want to embarrass Lin too much, so he let him win one game. In the end, Wang won the first set with a score of 6-1. From the second set, Wang already knew Lin's weaknesses, so he played casually and did not use any fierce volleys. Therefore, Lin was able to follow closely, and the score was closer. However, Wang still won the second set with a score of 7-5. In the third set, Wang showed his strength again and won four games in a row. Lin was at a loss and watched as he lost. Then Lin fought bravely and won back two games. After that, Wang won two more games, so he won in straight sets. The scores of each set were 6-1, 7-5, and 6-2, all won by Wang.</p>
<h3>Qian Yaobin Defeats Chen Zhongliang</h3>
<p>The match between Qian Yaobin from Sichuan and Chen Zhongliang from Hebei also started at 3:00 PM. Qian's skills were quite good, and his strokes were powerful, but he lacked control. Chen's skills were so-so, so Qian won very easily. In the end, Qian won in straight sets with a score of 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.</p>

<h3>Doubles Competition</h3>
<p>▲ Hebei Wins, Sichuan Forfeits</p>
<p>The doubles match was between Liang Zhenwen and Jin Huisheng from Hebei and Li Nan and Zheng Zuju from Sichuan. The skills of the two sides were different, but Liang and Jin cooperated slightly better, so they won the final victory. The first two sets were very competitive, but in the last two sets, Li and Zheng were in a slump. As a result, Liang and Jin won with scores of 1-6, 9-7, 6-1, and 6-1. The double match from Bacheng was forfeited to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Wang Chunjing (Jin) (6-1, 6-4) Huang Shuyi (Ping)</p>
<p>Bao Dajing (Chuan) (6-1, 6-2) Mao Yuwen (Hu)</p>
<p>▲ Wang Chunjing Wins Huang Shuyi</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Chunjing from Jin is the daughter of an English woman, so her face resembles that of a Western woman. She plays a good game of tennis, swings the racket freely, and is very skilled. Ms. Huang from Ping is also a veteran, famous in Pingjin, but in comparison, the situation is surprisingly different. In the first set, Huang from Ping only won one game, and Wang from Jin won with 6-1. From this, it can be seen that Wang Chunjing's skills are indeed extraordinary. In the second set, Huang tried hard to resist, and the competition was fierce, but in the end, Jin still won with 6-4.</p>
<p>▲ Bao Dajing Beats Mao Yuwen</p>
<p>In the first singles from Chuan, the Chuan player, Bao Dajing, who is a bit bulky, played against the Shanghai champion, Mao Yuwen. She performed average, and her shots were slow. Mao made many unforced errors and lost two sets in a row. Chuan won 6-1, 6-2.</p>
<p>[P Second Singles</p>
<p>Doubles Ping Wins Jin, Chuan Forfeits</p>
<p>Starting at 2:00 PM on the 17th, the women's tennis matches between Chuan and Hu, Jin and Ping included singles and doubles (four groups). In the doubles semi-finals, Chuan forfeited to Hu, and Ping won Jin. In the second singles, Chuan won Hu, and Jin won Ping. Overall, Chuan and Jin each eliminated Hu and Ping with a score of 2-1, and will compete in the final on the 19th.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Suffers Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Since Chuan forfeited the doubles, the battle for the final rights between Hu and Chuan depended entirely on the outcome of the second singles. Li Yupin from Chuan had impressive skills, comparable to Bao Dajing, who is a bit bulky. Huang Zhifang from Hu had average skills and lacked experience, leading to two consecutive losses. As a result, Li won 6-2, 6-0.</p>
<p>▲ Jin Finally Wins Ping</p>
<p>In the doubles match between Lu Huiqing and Si Yasha from Ping and Sun Guixiu and Chang Shixi from Jin, Lu and Si won quite easily. Sun and Chang were far from their opponents. As a result, Lu and Si won two consecutive sets with 6-2, 6-1. So the second singles was the key to the victory between Ping and Jin. Huang Shuqing from Ping had good skills, and her several kills earned applause from the audience. However, Wang Chunwei from Jin had rich experience and was skilled in ball techniques. Although Huang tried repeatedly to counterattack, she was ultimately powerless. In two sets, with scores of 6-1, 6-2, Wang from Jin won the final victory.</p>

When the Jing team attacked, Gao Yan, Huang Qingxiu, He Peifeng, and Lu Qing each ran back for one point. In this inning, the Jing team scored five points in one fell swoop. The Yue team seemed to be panting for breath.</p>
<h3>Cautiously, the Yue Team Pursued</h3>

<h3>Continuously Threatening, Adding Five More Points</h3>
<p>The Yue team, already at an advantage, continued to threaten and scored five more points in a row at the beginning of the fifth inning. The Jing team panicked and lost their composure, making mistake after mistake, giving the Yue team a good opportunity.</p>

<h3>Hu and Yue Two Heroes Compete for Hegemony Today Famous Generals Meet It Is Difficult to Tell the Difference Between Male and Female Striving Hard Can See the Difference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) Hu and Yue have already defeated Hong Kong and Zhejiang. Today, they will meet in the final to compete for hegemony. It will be held at 3:00 PM. Both sides have famous generals. It is not known whose world it will be after a battle.</p>
<h3>Intense Shanghai-Hong Kong Battle</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Wins 3-1 Against Hong Kong</p>
<p>丨Qiu, Cao, and Xu Contribute Greatly丨</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th Dispatch) The Men's Volleyball Championship involved fourteen units. After two weeks of preliminary rounds, only Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Zhejiang remained. At 3 PM on the 17th, the four teams simultaneously engaged in the semi-finals. One match was Shanghai versus Hong Kong, and the other was Guangdong versus Zhejiang. These two games were crucial to the championship outcome. The Shanghai-Hong Kong match was especially fierce. Without a do-or-die effort, they would lose the chance to win the championship. The intensity of the competition was even more exciting than watching "All Quiet on the Western Front" ten times. Consequently, the stadium was packed even before 2 PM. Eventually, Shanghai won the right to the final with a score of 3-1. The scores were 22-20, 21-11, 16-21, and 21-12. The referee was Liu Quanda.</p>
<p>▲ The Battle Begins with Intense Firepower: Shanghai's Zou Bingxin served first. Hong Kong's Rong Naizhao dove to pass. Hu Huidong executed a skillful maneuver, leaping off the court to block the ball, which landed on the ground, giving Hong Kong an initial two-point lead. The Shanghai team, ambitious from the start, saw Qiu Guangxie, Cao Yanzan, Xu Heng, and others performing vigorously. If the ball was not high enough, Qiu Guangxie would rush to cut it hard. If the ball came for a block, Xu Heng would leap high and press it lightly. The ball flew across the court, resembling a staged arena. The players of both teams, filled with murderous intent, battled neck and neck. The score for the first half of the game was like a mid-race contest in the 400-meter freestyle swimming for eleven men.</p>
<p>The score was 11 to 10. After switching sides, Hong Kong scored three consecutive points. Shanghai quickly caught up, immediately changing the momentum. The scores remained close. At 20-20, the firepower from both sides was even more intense. Finally, Shanghai's Cao Tingzan, gritting his teeth, delivered a clear and decisive strike. Hong Kong could not return it. Two more consecutive points allowed Shanghai to win the first set against Hong Kong with a score of 22-20.</p>
<p>▲ With Mighty Power, the Second Set Begins: Hong Kong's Li Wolin served and scored a point. His next serve was hit down by the opponent, resulting in a tie. Although Shanghai's strength was not significantly greater than Hong Kong's, both the front and back rows were competent. In the face of strong opposition, they demonstrated a fearless and selfless spirit, making repeated efforts and taking the lead with a score of 11-8. In the second half, Qiu Guangxie displayed even more mighty power. Wherever his fist struck, the opponent's area seemed splattered with blood. The score then widened to 19-11 in favor of Shanghai. The entire Hong Kong team appeared disorganized. Until the final two balls, Hong Kong's excessive force resulted in consecutive out-of-bounds plays, ending the set with a score of 21-12.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Turnaround: After losing two consecutive sets, Hong Kong replaced Lin Shaohua with new force Lu Baining in the third set. Having already won two sets, the Shanghai team inevitably became somewhat complacent. However, the Hong Kong team continued their tireless attacks, and Hu Yaodong's activity was unmatched throughout the game. In the first half, Hong Kong slightly turned the tide, taking the lead with an 11-8 advantage, a three-point difference. After switching sides, the Shanghai team was too careless and lost the set with a score of 16-21.</p>
<p>▲ Infinite Hope: At the start of the fourth set, Hong Kong scored the first point. Shanghai, taking the lead, was unwilling to easily give up the championship they so hoped for. Zou Bingdong received the ball and served with immense power. The three front-row players closed the door tightly. The first half ended with a score of 11-5. The second half was even more miraculous, with three or four spins and an even stronger murderous aura. When the Shanghai score reached 21-12, it signaled the successful completion of the game. The final score was 3-1. The final match at 3 PM on the 18th will be between Shanghai and Guangdong. The intensity of the battle is expected to be even greater than this one, and Shanghai's championship hopes are limitless.</p>

<h3>Major Change, Hoping to Win Against Hong Kong</h3>
<p>▲ Wins Right to Final 4-3</p>
<p>▲ Two Extra Innings Decide the Winner</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) In the baseball semi-final between Hong Kong and Hebei on the 17th, Hebei batted first, and Hong Kong scored a point in the opening inning. Hong Kong scored another point in the fourth inning. Hebei scored two points. Hong Kong added another point in the fifth inning. In the top of the seventh inning, Hebei also added a point, making the score a 3-3 tie. Two extra innings were played. Hebei scored a point in the ninth inning, thus winning against Hong Kong 4-3 and gaining the right to the final. Their opponent is Guangdong. There is a greater hope for Guangdong to win the championship.</p>
<p>▲ Hong Kong Takes the Lead: The men's baseball semi-final between Hong Kong and Hebei was held at 2 PM. Hebei attacked first. Hong Kong's pitcher was accurate and fast, leaving Hebei with nothing. Hong Kong's Zhou Longjun was saved by Zheng Fa. Hong Kong took the lead with one point.</p>
<p>▲ Heavily Guarded: In the second and third innings, both sides were heavily guarded. Guan Shaofu and Zheng Qingyang displayed their skills, each gaining nothing. The situation was evenly matched. In the fourth inning, Hebei made an effort to counterattack. Chen Zhendong reached first base, and Guan Shaofu hit another safe hit. Luo Zongxing threw back. Chen Zhendong and Guan Shaofu also returned to home base. Hebei temporarily won 2-1. Hong Kong's Zhong Cansen regained a point, making the score 3-3, evenly matched.</p>
<p>▲ One Successful Strike: In the fifth inning, Hebei gained nothing again. Hong Kong's Yang Mosheng used his strength to hit a ball that floated to the left field. Fang Gutong was too late to catch it. Yang Mosheng safely returned to home base. Hong Kong won 3-2. In the sixth inning, neither side gained anything.</p>

<h3>Today's Situation for Men's and Women's Sports</h3>
<p>There are two types of semi-finals and three types of finals in the sports competition on the 18th. The Shanghai team is qualified to participate in all of them, and their opponents are all from Guangdong. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a Shanghai-Guangdong confrontation. The competition is expected to be even more intense than on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Men's Volleyball Final</h3>
<p>In the volleyball match where Shanghai defeated Hong Kong, the heavy pressure from Qiu Guangxie and Lu Kangyuan, the central distribution from Zeng Tingzan, the strong front-row blocking, Xu Heng's skillful techniques, and the experienced back-row ball retrieval and passing were remarkable. Their opponent in the final is Guangdong, whose famous player Li Lian is in the front row. The center, Wei Yuanju's heavy pressure, is terrifying and comparable to Qiu Guangxie. The talent on both teams is balanced, and they are equally matched. It is unknown who will win the fierce battle, but the performance will be even better than the Shanghai-Hong Kong match. It is truly a must-see battle.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Final</h3>
<p>The Shanghai women's basketball team initially had no hope of winning the championship, but their ambition to win was very firm. As expected, they defeated the only strong opponent, the Fujian women's team, and hope arose spontaneously. Their opponent in the final on the 18th is Guangdong, who is also very strong. The competition, starting at 2 PM, is expected to be no less intense than the battle with Fujian.</p>
<h3>Women's Softball Final</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the newcomer Shanghai women's softball team was able to qualify for the final. After defeating the long-standing North China champion Beijing team with a score of 13-8, the entire team's spirit was exceptionally high, and they developed the ambition to win the championship. It can be said that they did not make a sound until they surprised everyone with a single cry. Their opponent in the final is also Guangdong. Victory is particularly difficult. It is predicted that Guangdong will win with fierce batting, while Shanghai will win with a strong defense. Who will win the championship is uncertain. However, the rapid progress of the Shanghai team is gratifying.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball Semi-final</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu men's basketball team is scheduled to play in the semi-final on the morning of the 18th. Shanghai will also meet Guangdong. Shanghai is good at outsmarting their opponents, while Guangdong is good at fighting with strength. Each has its own advantages, and there will be a fierce battle. Shanghai may be able to secure a victory. The strength of both Hebei and Nanjing is strong. In terms of lineup, Hebei is slightly better. Judging from each team, Hebei is intelligent and courageous and has the most accomplishments. The championship should go to Hebei.</p>
<h3>Women's Volleyball Semi-final</h3>
<p>The Shanghai and Guangdong women's volleyball teams are very strong. Unfortunately, they meet in the semi-final. Guangdong has a long-standing reputation and is similar to the men's team. However, the Guangdong men's team has shown signs of wavering in this competition, and the same is true for the women's team. The Shanghai women's team has excellent coordination and a well-organized defense. In addition, Guan Liuzhu and Huang Xingfen's kills are formidable. Although Guangdong is strong, they should not be optimistic. In the second group semi-final, Hong Kong seems likely to win against Ping.</p>
<h3>Men's and Women's Overall Championship</h3>
<p>Shanghai has already won the men's all-around track and field championship. If they win one more championship in any sport, they can win the overall championship. Shanghai can confidently win the tennis championship. They have already reached the finals in volleyball and soccer and have considerable hope in those areas as well. In short, Shanghai can confidently win the men's overall championship. On the women's side, Shanghai has already won the track and field championship. If they can win any one of the volleyball, softball, and basketball championships, they can also win the women's overall championship. In addition to Shanghai, Guangdong and Hong Kong also have a chance for the women's overall championship. In short, the sports championships, except for women's tennis, will be contested by Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Final Struggle: Luo Zongxing scored a point. Hong Kong counterattacked, and although Zheng Fa occupied second base, there were still no results. Thus, the score was 3-3, a tie, and the game went into extra innings. In the eighth inning, neither side scored. In the ninth inning, Luo Zongxing made a safe hit, and Luo Zongming sent the ball back. Bao Wensha saved Luo Zongxing. Hebei won 4-3 and secured the right to the final.</p>

<h3>President Wang and Others to Host Athletes Tomorrow Night; Cheng Yanqiu Travels South to Perform</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th Dispatch) President Wang visited the stadium in the afternoon on the 17th to watch men's and women's swimming. When the various competitions were intense, Wang clapped his hands in support, especially showing concern for the athletes from Guangdong and Hong Kong. He left the venue around 4 PM and returned to his residence. Chairman Lin, Wang Dai, and the five Presidents of the Yuan and the Military Commission are scheduled to host team leaders and athletes from various provinces at the basketball court on the evening of the 19th, screening a feature film of the Games. The National Games have specially invited Cheng Yanqiu to travel south to perform in order to comfort the athletes and staff from various provinces and cities. Cheng has telegraphed his acceptance and is expected to arrive in Beijing on the 19th. He is scheduled to perform his masterpiece "Nie Yinniang" at the sports ground that night, rest on the 20th, and give voluntary performances at the Lihishe from the 21st onwards. The proceeds will be used to relieve the Yellow River flood.</p>
<h3>Central Military Academy Hosts Banquet for Northeast Athletes</h3>
<p>(Central Dispatch, Nanjing, 17th) The Central Military Academy will hold a banquet for the Northeast athletes at the academy's Gongzi Dining Hall at 6 PM on the 18th. Athletes from the academy and Northeast students will attend as hosts, totaling 300 people. During the banquet, four large flags made in advance will be presented to the provinces, and each athlete will receive a portrait of President Chiang and a commemorative badge, as well as several books.</p>
<h3>The 10,000-Meter Dispute Naturally Comes to an End</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th Dispatch) The 10,000-meter dispute has caused much discussion, with everyone sticking to their own opinions and no one knowing the truth. However, after Jiangsu protested and refuted the decision, the Competition Committee has officially announced that Jin Gu won first place. This matter has naturally come to an end. Even if Su Jinzhong Kangguo can win the exhibition match, they cannot overturn the official announcement of the Competition Committee and re-adjudicate the race to award Su Jinzhong Kang first place. This is absolutely impossible. If so, how can the current situation not be considered to have come to an end? The exhibition match is another event outside of the problem, and it is an unofficial attempt to clarify the truth and the facts. Success or failure, honor or disgrace, who is right and who is wrong, can be easily determined in this unofficial competition, also known as the exhibition match, to dispel people's doubts. The reporter still hopes that this exhibition match can be realized.</p>
<h3>The Upcoming Second National Arts National Examination</h3>
<p>▲ Eighth Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>Central National Arts Museum Director Zhang Zhijiang, in view of the frequent foreign aggression in recent years,</p>
<p>Wants to avoid the tragedy of national subjugation. Everyone must have the spirit of martial arts and struggle. Therefore, the second National Arts National Examination will be held on the 20th of this month, as reported in this newspaper.

Therefore, it was suggested to divide it into two categories with prices of two jiao and four jiao. The entire body agreed. It was resolved to pass the two-jiao and four-jiao rates.

It has been decided to appoint Mr. Su as a judge of the National Examination Committee.</p>
<h3>Visit to Liu Fengshan, a Famous Master of National Arts</h3>
<p>— Dunzheng</p>
<p>National Arts occupies a very important position in China. Unfortunately, the government's emphasis on literature and neglect of military affairs almost led to its extinction. After the founding of the Republic of China, patriots quickly promoted it. Both the National Arts Examination and the National Games attach great importance to it in recent years and have become popular at home and abroad. The credit for this is largely due to Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central National Arts Guard Museum. As a result, the martial spirit has gradually become more valued. Rising stars in the National Arts world are also emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain. However, when it comes to the famous masters of the older generation, they are all respectable. The National Arts referees at this National Games are all outstanding figures of the time, mostly from the North. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Mr. Liu Fengshan (courtesy name Caichen), a famous master of National Arts, and inquired about various matters. He was granted an audience and gave a very detailed talk, which is recorded below for the respect of those who care about National Arts.</p>
<p>Reporter asked, (the following imitates this) I have long admired your name. I am very grateful for the good fortune of meeting you through Mr. Tan Mengxian's introduction. Liu replied, (the following imitates this) You are too polite, Mr. Chen. Thank you for your hard work. Please sit down. (Asked) How old are you this year, sir? (Answered) Seventy years old. (Asked) Sir, you are healthy at your age, which is amazing. (Answered) It's nothing, but this is the reward for practicing National Arts. (Asked) How many years have you been practicing National Arts, sir? (Answered) I was often sick as a child. I started practicing National Arts at the age of twenty-four, and it has been more than forty years now. (Asked) Which Kung Fu do you like to practice most, sir? (Answered) Tai Chi, Xingyi, Bagua, Liuhe, and Yue's Boxing. I like them all. (Asked) You have a very strong interest in National Arts, sir. I admire that very much. (Answered) You're too polite. (Asked) You must have many outstanding disciples, sir. (Answered) Du Yibin and others are. (Answered) Who is your master, sir? (Answered) Liu Dekuan, also known as "Big Spear Liu." (Asked) Do you have any new contributions to National Arts, sir? (Answered) Recently, I invented a Tai Chi brush that is related to Tai Chi boxing. It's just using a brush to exercise. (Asked) How is the Tai Chi brush made? (Answered) It is made of steel, about eight inches long, and divided into three sections. At this point, Liu took out the brush for viewing. It was shiny and convenient to use, truly a new contribution to National Arts. (Asked) Have you taught this to many people? (Answered) Not yet. I am just planning to contribute it. At this point, the reporter, due to time constraints, excused himself and left. Before leaving, Liu hurriedly said, "Mr. Chen, don't exaggerate too much in the newspaper to avoid jealousy from my colleagues." Liu's words also show the jealousy in the National Arts world, which is not a good thing.</p>

<h3>Nanhua Sports Association Donates Money for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of 2,220 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Remitted to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Yesterday for Verification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster received 2,220 yuan from the Nanhua Sports Association of Hong Kong yesterday, with a letter requesting them to distribute the funds on their behalf. The letter stated, "Dear sirs, since the Yellow River breached its banks, causing disaster in several provinces, our association, although located far away in the south, is deeply saddened. We asked the Shanghai Guangzhao Public Office to verify the situation and learned that your joint association has been established, which shows your sincerity in helping those in need and your courage in raising funds. We are deeply impressed. Although our association is a sports organization, we cannot ignore the severity of the Yellow River disaster. Therefore, we have raised 2,000 Hong Kong dollars, which the Guangdong Bank of Hong Kong has converted into 2,220 yuan and remitted to your joint association for verification. Please record this as our association's donation. We would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter. Sincerely yours, Nanhua Sports Association of Hong Kong, Chairman Lu Aiyun. Addressed to: Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster."</p>
<h3>China Track and Field Association to Hold Public Competition for Men and Women</h3>
<p>The China Track and Field Association has scheduled the third annual Chinese Men's and Women's Open Track and Field Competition (men's 13 miles, women's 2 miles) for the 29th of this month, as previously reported. As the date approaches, registration from members and non-members has been enthusiastic, nearing one hundred participants. Several dozen women are also participating, including groups from Patriotic Girls' School, Liangjiang Physical Education School, and Wu Ben Girls' School, who have requested the association send instructors. The awards committee is actively working on the prize selection. It is reported that they have secured multiple large silver cups from suppliers such as the Youth Goods Supply Company, Standard Sports Equipment Company, Fu Chang Gifts Bureau, and Mr. Ma Jinfu.</p>
<p>In other news, the association, to promote the upcoming competition, held a 5,000-meter race demonstration on the 14th at the track and field. The results were excellent, breaking previous records. The uniforms were neat, and the posture was accurate, greatly praised by the guests. However, the audience was not very large, and many missed the event, which is regrettable. The association deeply apologizes and would like to perform again, and the committee has agreed. It is tentatively scheduled for the 17th or 19th before the football final. However, due to the team members' job responsibilities, they cannot stay for long, and due to a lack of funds, the Municipal Education Bureau cannot provide further subsidies. This good opportunity can only be missed. However, there will be opportunities in the future, and if there is a chance, they will come to the capital again to study together.</p>
<h3>Linghai and Ding Compete, Post Office Team Wins Championship</h3>

<h3>U.S. Government Rescinds Ban on Foreign Students, Revises Restrictions: Foreign Students May Not Hold Jobs</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Mr. Huang Zhisheng, a student at Columbia University in the United States, after the U.S. government issued a ban on foreign students last September, abolishing the work-study system, people believed that this action was tantamount to a cultural blockade policy, and the public expressed dissatisfaction. The authorities have now sought to change the approach. Foreign students in the United States, in addition to engaging in various academic researches, may not hold any positions in the United States and must be supervised by the U.S. government educational agencies. Henceforth, students from various countries will have the opportunity to study in the United States again. In 1930, there were 10,487 foreign students in the United States, including 1,336 Chinese students. Last year's survey showed only 3,220 foreign students, and the number of Chinese students had decreased to 954.</p>
<h3>Czech Workers' Games</h3>
<p>▲ To Be Held Next July</p>
<p>The Czech Workers' Sports Federation is preparing for the Third National Workers' Games, scheduled to be held in Prague, Czech Republic, from July 5th to 8th, 1934. The Federation is composed of 1,311 labor union organizations, with a total of 137,871 members. Therefore, despite the current economic downturn, it is expected that at least 35,000 people will participate. In addition to the four sports associations in the country (Czech, German, Polish, and Ruthenian), the United States, Yugoslavia, and Lithuania have also prepared to participate. In addition, Britain, Belgium, France, Austria, and other countries have also agreed to join.</p>

<p>(Nanchang correspondence) In recent years, students graduating from secondary schools in various provinces have been unable to make decisions about further education and employment, often leading to confusion and uncertainty. Some fail to carefully consider their suitability for schools or jobs, without considering their personality or academic ability. This often leads to setbacks and mid-course corrections, wasting time. This has a significant impact on educational effectiveness, individual and social livelihoods. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has issued a general outline of measures for educational administrative organs and primary and secondary school students in all provinces and cities regarding further education and career guidance to the education departments and bureaus of each province and city, ordering them to formulate detailed implementation measures in accordance with Article 4 of the outline and submit them to the ministry for approval and implementation. After receiving the order, the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department has begun to formulate detailed plans for these measures. The most important tasks include establishing committees for guidance about further education and careers in primary and secondary schools, establishing career guidance and placement offices, investigating the social, economic, and occupational conditions in the province, and conducting intelligence and physical tests in schools, all of which are being actively planned and implemented step by step.</p>
<h3>Fujian Selects Students for Needy Student Scholarships</h3>
<p>▲ Those Applying to Universities Inside and Outside the Province Will Be Admitted</p>
<p>▲ A Sign of Gradual Improvement in Student Levels</p>
<p>Education in Fujian Province was previously quite low, resulting in high school graduates often failing to be selected when applying to universities across the country. After Zheng Zhenwen took office as the Education Director, he focused on improving the efficiency of school curriculums and increased supervision. As a result, the results of this year's joint exams were quite excellent. At the same time, needy university scholarships are being offered to give poor children the opportunity to study. The students selected for the second needy scholarship this academic year who applied to universities inside and outside the province were all admitted to their chosen fields of study. This indicates that student levels are gradually improving. A list is provided below:</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>After Reading "Virgins and Rising Dragons"</h3>
<p>— Shui</p>
<p>In the past few days, there was an article on "Free Talk" called "Virgins and Rising Dragons," which humorously spoke many twisted words, and the main idea was that all magazines promoting virgin works, etc., were ways to make money for the boss.</p>
<p>Such a judgment is even more satisfying than an experienced official settling a case.</p>
<p>But this made me think of something else: that is, as the saying goes, "the tongue is flat, speech is round." A person's opinions often have different market prices in the morning and evening. In the morning, one can hate the "old writers" for controlling certain publications and loudly advocate that publications should introduce new writers and virgin works as much as possible. By the evening, one can change again to humorously satirize that promoting virgin works is just a way for the boss to make money. Only heaven knows the "opportunity" in between!</p>
<p>However, if we follow the "money bag theory" of the author of "Virgins and Rising Dragons," we can also imagine why a person's opinions differ in the morning and evening. The fox saying the grapes are sour is thought-provoking once again here.</p>
<p>If we split open the "money bag theory," then the question is only whether the work is worth introducing. If it is a work worth introducing, it doesn't matter whether it is a real virgin or a "woman" who is mistaken for a virgin (like the work of a certain gentleman mentioned in the article "Virgins and Rising Dragons"). The problem is very simple. I don't understand why we must start from the "money bag" in a "materialist historical view"?</p>
<p>China still does not have a detailed "index of all magazines over the years," so it is common for people not to remember even if a writer has published works before (is no longer a virgin). This is also a very simple matter. Why say they are being sold as virgins?</p>
<p>These questions probably only have one answer: "The tongue is flat, speech is round," that's all.</p>
<h3>Enduring Humiliation and Pain</h3>
<p>— To Li</p>
<p>It is said that a few days ago, at the entrance of the Haijingbo Circus, a Chinese spectator somehow bumped into a foreign constable, who slapped him. This person then shouted loudly: "Chinese unite! Chinese unite!" Because there were many Chinese spectators in front of the circus, he wanted to incite their public debt to punish the constable. However, no one paid attention to him at the time. Only afterwards, some people discussed it. According to the most sensible people, this beaten Chinese person's cry for help was naturally ignored at that time because people were busy rushing into the circus to watch the show. Moreover, it is very common for foreign constables to slap Chinese people, and it is a personal matter. Why make a fuss and deliberately exaggerate it as a national humiliation? If this also counts as a national humiliation, then the annual national humiliation memorial service will never end, right?</p>
<p>Regarding the right and wrong of this matter, I think what the public has said is very appropriate, and I don't want to say more. But this made me think that there are two kinds of spirits that have been popularized in China, but no one has publicly advocated them, and they are actually very necessary. I want to take this opportunity to talk about them. These two kinds of spirits are: enduring humiliation and enduring pain. The former is about the spiritual aspect, and the latter is about the physical aspect.</p>
<p>Now, let's start with the event mentioned earlier. This person who was slapped by a foreign constable naturally felt pain on the one hand and humiliation on the other. It is natural to feel unfair and want to resist. However, the opponent is a foreigner and has a gun, so one person cannot resist. Therefore, he wanted to borrow the assistance of his compatriots, but his compatriots ignored him. How disappointing is this? If he hadn't shouted in the first place, endured some humiliation and pain, and quietly squeezed into the crowd, no one would have known that he had been slapped. How much trouble would this have saved? Fortunately, the other spectators were able to not regard the harmful incident as a national humiliation, or were able to endure it even if they regarded it as a national humiliation. Otherwise, if a real commotion had broken out, not only would the Haijingbo Circus have closed, but it might even have caused a shocking tragedy, creating a larger and more genuine national humiliation, harming the entire country, while the shame of one slap would still not have been avenged. How miscalculated would this be?</p>
<p>"A small impatience ruins great plans," the sage said long ago, but this spectator did not think of it.</p>
<p>Judging from the historical situation, the degree of Chinese people's endurance of humiliation is still quite good. This is probably thanks to Mr. Shi De's advocacy, and also because humiliation is a spiritual aspect, so it is easier to endure. As for pain, because it is felt by the physical body, the feeling is more sharp and clear, so it is not easy to endure. Many of those who feel angry after being slapped are probably still due to the pain. But as a Chinese person, it is really necessary to endure pain. I will now give a few stories of enduring pain as examples.</p>
<p>The most widely spread story is probably Xiahou Dun plucking out his eye and eating it and Guan Yunchang scraping his bone to remove poison in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Another example is from Northern History: "Wei Changsheng's son Yan fell from a horse and broke his arm, with the bone on his elbow protruding more than an inch. They opened the flesh and sawed the bone, with blood flowing several liters, but he spoke and laughed as usual." History of the Five Dynasties: "Chu Congjian was hit by an arrow in the middle of the stream, with the arrowhead embedded in the bone. The craftsman had no good medicine and wanted to chisel the bone to remove it. Congjian ordered him to chisel it, but the craftsman hesitated and could not bear to do it. Congjian urged him, and everyone around him seemed unable to bear the pain, but Congjian endured it himself." These people all had the style of Guan Gong.</p>
<p>In Roman legends, I know of two people who were also extremely able to endure pain.</p>
<p>One is Mucius Scaevola. When Rome was surrounded by the army of the Etruscan king, Mucius stabbed the king but failed and was captured. The king ordered him to choose between "death" and "pain." He expressed no fear and put his right arm on the stove himself, burning it to ashes from the shoulder down without showing any pain. He also said to the king that there were three hundred heroic assassins like him in Rome, all wanting the king's death. The king was frightened, and the siege was lifted.</p>
<p>This story is extremely moving, but the Chinese do not need to imitate it, because once China is surrounded by foreign countries, even if there are such patriotic people, it cannot be saved. If someone does this, it will be futile and not worth it. Let's still learn from another person.</p>
<p>This person was a slave, but also a philosopher, named Epictetus. Once, his master twisted his arm in front of guests as a joke. He twisted it very hard, almost breaking it. So he warned: "If you twist it any further, it will break." His master twisted it again, and it did break. But he showed no pain and instead congratulated himself on his prediction, saying to his master: "Didn't I tell you?"</p>
<p>For Chinese people who are preparing to become slaves, this slave philosopher's attitude is the best example. He can endure humiliation and pain, and he also has a bit of "humor," which is most likely to please the master and add to the excitement of the banquet.</p>
<p>All my compatriots, quickly cultivate these two kinds of spirits!</p>
<h3>Reading the "Jue Lan" Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wei Mengke</p>
<p>Reading Shen Bao, I saw a "Jue Lan Society Art Exhibition" advertisement prominently displayed at the top of the Free Talk section. It is said that the Jue Lan Society is an art club organized by a group of young art apprentices. Being young, they must have fresh, progressive works, so it is natural to go and see them.</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival was truly peaceful that day. There were certainly no firecrackers, and even the Blue Sky White Sun flag and red lanterns were rarely seen. On such a peaceful holiday, it is most appropriate to go out and enjoy some elegance. Seeing an art exhibition is the best thing to do.</p>
<p>So, after lunch, two friends and I went to Avenue Joffre. After turning a corner, a bamboo cloth advertisement stretched across the street stopped us. Facing us was a tall Western-style building reaching into the clouds. A sign at the gate read: "World College."</p>
<p>Entering the gate was the auditorium. The architecture of this auditorium was quite modern, but I couldn't say which style of new architecture it belonged to. The doors of the auditorium were carved with strange and peculiar patterns. In the middle of the wall hung a plaque with a family letter from Wu Zhi Lao. The calligraphy was so neat that it was almost indistinguishable from the advertisement characters in a shop. As expected of a renowned figure, I was truly impressed. Beside the plaque were rows of glass display cases. I knew that this should be the venue for the Jue Lan Society art exhibition.</p>
<p>So I quickly looked at the glass display cases, looking at the masterpieces inside the frames.</p>
<p>However, I am very sorry to say that I understood very little of so many works. I didn't understand why the apples in Mr. Yang Taiyang's "Fruits and Chimney" could be placed on a roof with a chimney. I was also puzzled by the green flowers and red leaves in Miss Qiu Di's "Still Life." The large areas of red and green in Mr. Wang Jiyuan's "Style" almost made me think the forest was on fire. In addition, the many human figures with small heads and fat legs made me suspect that all the models in China were suffering from edema. ... However, one piece, Mr. Liu Shi's "Composition," caught my eye and made me linger for two or three minutes. This was a painting that used a somber and solid color tone, utilizing woodcut lines to express the family of a hard-working poor person. Perhaps the structure was not very good, but the hunger, cold, and painful expressions of the poor were completely depicted by him. Not only could anyone understand it at a glance, but it also gave people a sense of emotion and resonance. Such an art piece that captures reality, is familiar to the public, is probably rare in the current smoggy Chinese art scene. I heard that Mr. Liu Shi often likes to talk about factions and play with strange and peculiar things after unfortunately holding a solo exhibition and being praised by celebrities. But if he can truly realize his mistake and return to reality, to find the new life of art in the life of the hard-working masses, then his future may still be bright, I think.</p>
<p>Leaving World College, I felt a bit empty in my heart, but also happy. After all, they are a group of young people. The mistakes of young people are often unavoidable. If they are willing to lower their perceived level of art, then fresh, progressive works will eventually emerge. Mr. Liu Shi's work is a good example.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Appendicitis"</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Song Chunfang's play theory includes a futurist play he wrote called Appendicitis. It tells the story of a patient who seeks medical treatment. The doctor diagnoses him with appendicitis and introduces him to a famous surgeon, with a slight reduction in the medical fee, which is still four to five thousand yuan. The patient, carrying the money, goes to see the surgeon, traveling through a wilderness. Suddenly, he encounters a robber who, not satisfied with stealing the money, stabs him in the lower abdomen. When he sees the surgeon, the surgeon says that the appendix has already been removed, thanks to the robber's knife, considering it a strange event. But the patient praises the robber as a benefactor, saying that he saved four to five thousand yuan of unjust money. The robber is imprisoned, and the judge announces:</p>
<p>"You have not committed the crime of murder, but you practiced medicine without the permission of the police station, so you are sentenced to six months in jail."</p>
<p>Mr. Song says that futurist dramas are completely a kind of "unreasonable" farce. In my opinion, the so-called unreasonableness has its own reasons; it seems like a farce, but it also has its serious side. Just like Mr. Song's play, anyone who has suffered from appendicitis and had it removed by a Western doctor, and resented the high cost, truly feels that the doctor is crueler than a robber. As for the robber's knife precisely cutting off the appendix, it is naturally an "unreasonable" thing. But the judge does not convict the robber of murder and robbery, but only reprimands him for practicing medicine without registering with the police station, sentencing him to six months of imprisonment, which is truly a great farce.</p>
<p>On the evening of February 21st this year, I suddenly suffered from acute appendicitis, which I did not initially realize. I only felt a sharp abdominal pain and incessant vomiting, so I smoked opium until I was drunk, which stopped the pain and allowed me to sleep. The next morning, the abdominal pain persisted, accompanied by pain all over my body, making it impossible to find a comfortable position. So I asked a friend to call Dr. Zhang. By the time the doctor arrived, it was already afternoon. He said that I needed to be operated on in the hospital immediately, otherwise it would be too late. So we went by car, waiting for the doctor in the emergency room. Several surgeons came together to examine me, and also drew blood for testing. Then I was admitted to the ward. One doctor said, "The diagnosis is indeed appendicitis, but it has been more than twenty-four hours, and the appendix has ruptured with pus, so surgery will have to wait." When the pain was severe, I was given an injection of morphine. I did not take any medicine, but absolutely refrained from eating, only drinking water. After nearly ten days, the fever gradually subsided, and the pain also gradually stopped. I started to eat liquid and soft foods. After another ten days, I returned home to recuperate. But according to the doctor's later words to me, my illness was actually very dangerous. If the ruptured appendix with pus had turned into peritonitis, it would have been incurable. Now, my appendicitis seems to have healed, but to cure it completely, surgery is necessary, and the doctor's words seem credible.</p>
<p>While my intestinal disease had not yet recovered, my wife was also admitted to the hospital for surgery for an intestinal disease. She had an intestinal obstruction that ruptured and bled, and her condition was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, after the surgery, she recovered well, and now it has been three months, and there is hope for recovery, which is truly a great blessing in misfortune.</p>
<p>When my wife was hospitalized, I heard that Professor Ou Kexuan was diagnosed with appendicitis and treated by a Japanese doctor, but died after surgery. My friend Yue Sibing also had surgery for appendicitis, and his condition was initially very dangerous, but he fortunately recovered. Alas, how dangerous are intestinal diseases, and how many people suffer from them!</p>
<h3>Two Brothers</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"Ah!" Old Man Roland suddenly exclaimed. He hadn't moved for a long time, his eyes fixed on the water, sometimes lifting the fishing rod hanging in the sea with a very light movement.</p>
<p>At the stern of the boat, Madame Roland, who was dozing beside Madame Lu Zui Mi, who had been invited to fish together for fun, woke up and turned to her husband, saying:</p>
<p>"What is it! What is it! Old man!"</p>
<p>The honest old man, angry and irritable, replied:</p>
<p>"Not a single fish is biting anymore. I haven't caught anything since noon. We should only fish with men in the future; women always make you start too late."</p>
<p>His two sons, Bi Er and Zhe An, one sitting on the left side of the boat and the other on the right, each holding a coiled fishing rod, couldn't help laughing together at this time. Zhe An said to his father:</p>
<p>"Dad, you are too impolite to our guest."</p>
<p>Old Man Roland became embarrassed and apologized, saying:</p>
<p>"Please don't be angry, Mrs. Lu, I've always been like this. Because I like being with ladies, I invite them along, and then, once I feel like I'm on the water, I put all my attention on the fish."</p>
<p>Madame Roland was now fully awake, looking at the shore and the vast expanse of the sea with a kind of emotion. She murmured:</p>
<p>"But you've already caught quite a few."</p>
<p>But her husband shook his head to indicate otherwise, although he also cast a favorable glance at the fish basket—the fish caught by the three men were still jumping vaguely in the basket. We could distinguish a gentle sound made by the gluey scales, the weak and forced wings, and the gasps in the deadly air.</p>
<p>Old Man Roland grabbed the fish basket between his knees and tilted it, letting the silvery fish flow to the edge of the basket, so he could see the ones at the bottom. Then their dying throes became more intense, and the strong smell of the fish, a beneficial salty smell of the sea, rose from the full belly of the basket.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on "Breaking Records"</h3>
<p>— Congyun</p>
<p>In the midst of the National Games, only "breaking records" is heard like a string of firecrackers. It's not weak after all! In this "backward" China, the sudden discovery of this group of vigorous young people making amazing achievements, how can it not be exciting for a moment, at least gradually eliminating the nickname of "Sick Man of East Asia."</p>
<p>In recent years, the rapid progress of Chinese sports history, on the one hand, is due to the spirit of the sports community and the efforts of the athletes; on the other hand, it must be attributed to the active promotion of the education community. Therefore, every school has one or two "physical education" classes every week, and in the spring and autumn of each year, time is taken to hold several Shanghai Secondary School Games, and the school's own sports meet, plus the extra "International Games", in addition to several hours of practice every day.</p>
<p>But then again, having a purely physical body cannot represent the entire way to save the country, but "facts" tell us like a joke that a university student cannot write a letter home (not to mention the "Sports Masters" written by a certain gentleman in this journal last month). Although this does not only refer to athletes, athletes have been generally recognized as the main part of it. Perhaps some people will be surprised, if so, how do they survive in the university? This is originally a special deformed life. They live in the school, not only do they not need to spend tuition fees, but they also do not need to worry about clothing expenses, and even the school subsidizes miscellaneous expenses. Is the school foolish? Or are they using them and holding them up as a way to appeal? It is nothing more than a kind of deformed competition in society. Athletes can be said to have great magical powers!</p>
<p>Because of this, those who come out of the halls of learning, even those who have traveled to foreign lands and returned from victorious scenic spots, are still confused. Those who study chemistry and science cannot even untangle the formulas. What are they afraid of? As long as they have face and thick arms, are they afraid of not having a position? If they become something like a chief or a section, what they have learned is not useful, so they use two secretaries. Fortunately, they only need to have the ability to sign. Poor scholars? They can only accept their fate and look for a "way out"!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that this sports event has such good records is certainly the effort of the promoting gentlemen. I hope that these gentlemen will continue to uphold the spirit of saving the country and make further efforts to create several other new records, the construction of roads, the implementation of administration, the relief of industry, and: these are what we urgently need. I hope there will be achievements year after year, and new records will be added every year.</p>
<p>Although the words are like this, the doer still does it himself, but, in any case, do not be like the "flying arrows" "flying thunder" "flying: : :" during the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, flying all over the sky without flying out half a shadow. I hope that the gentlemen in charge will scrape together some pocket money to help them for a while, this is also promotion! And it is true salvation of the country, although it is a cruel killing tool, but in this beastly world it is needed.</p>
<h3>Chess and Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Yazhu</p>
<p>Chess is a kind of toy that hones the mind. This kind of open and honest struggle is a noble game of wits, and can also be used as practice for dealing with the world or improving society.</p>
<p>Playing chess takes the killing of the enemy's commander as the goal. As long as the goal can be achieved, therefore taking pains, attacking tortuously, defending strictly, or not killing important members of the enemy, or not hesitating to make great sacrifices for oneself. Defending on one side and advancing on the other. Or attacking while defending, or defending while attacking, or feinting to the east and attacking to the west, or retreating to advance. Although there are thousands of changes and hundreds of cunning plans, they are all honest actions, all actions to achieve the goal. Therefore, playing chess can cultivate a spirit of purposeful struggle, a consistent spirit, and a bravery to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>A person doing things in society is just like playing chess. If one has a definite goal in playing chess, and a spirit of sacrifice and struggle, one will surely achieve something.</p>
<p>Mahjong is groping in the dark, the tiles are stacked in the dark, opening the circle is at the mercy of the dice. Except when Konging or Punging one can use one's own cleverness and experience, with how much deliberation, most of it relies on fate, the so-called card wind. If the card wind is bad, no matter how much experience you have, it will be useless. So most people who play cards rely on luck. Since winning or losing cannot be grasped, one is happy to leave it to fate. Therefore, unconsciously, one will develop a decadent, fate-accepting, inferior habit, and lose ambition. Cunning people are not subject to fate, that is, the card wind, so they use their ghostly tricks, or adjust the cards, or fly the cards: : : : use their despicable means, which is even uglier and worse.</p>
<p>So I think playing chess is much better than playing mahjong.</p>
