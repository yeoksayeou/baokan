<p>内容分三段將儘量採用李頓報告書</p>
<p>推英法德意等九國爲委員德任主席</p>
<p>愛爾蘭未列入意代表態度模稜可異</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今晨集議兩小時、决定推舉九人爲草擬報告之委員、此起草委員會將以德·瑞士·英·法·捷克·比·意·瑞典·與西班牙·九國之代表各一人組成之、而以德代表爲主席、今晨十九特委會之討論、甚爲激昂、集中於草擬中日爭議報告之問題、此報告之初段、將論及此爭議之歷史上起源、會衆對於此叚之如何着筆、主張頗不相同、英代表提議李頓報告書對於此層、已有充分論列、應採用之、若圖另起爐灶、則徒費時間耳、但討論良久後、會衆决定推舉九人組織上述之小組委員會、集合各方面提出之意見、蓋知欲立即獲得關於草稿之决定爲不可能也、衆料九人小組委員會準備其報告書、至少須費一星期、目前僅辦理歷史部份、而十九特委會尙須集會以議定報告書第　段應有之建議、本星期内有其他國際會議多起、故九人小組委員會下屆集會何日舉行、難以决定、但明日行政院開會後、或可集議也、十九特委會主席希孟今晚離此、但將時常以電話與起草委員九人接洽、而以起草會與特委會間之鏈環自任、九人小組委員會未列入愛爾蘭代表、此間人士對之、頗有批評、蓋以愛爾蘭爲行政院主席、並在日内瓦最近發展中有頗活動之動作也、十九特委會大約在本月底將再集議、屆時將决定國聯大會之召集日期、照國聯之定章、大會須儘速召集、否則二月初亦須開會若干小國欲此報告書對於日本歷來之行爲、爲更詳切之指責、意代表阿洛錫今日態度顯然不落邊際、實則在關於中日爭議之日内瓦最近發展中、意國態度固常如是也、</p>
<p>會塲公報　十九特委會今日散會後、發出公報如下、</p>
<p>十九特委會今已舉行其第一次之討論、以研究報告書草稿所應有之方式、此種報告書、乃特委會所可提交國聯大會、俾大會履行其盟約第十五條第四節下之任務、今特委會已考慮應用何種方法、將特委會調解爭議努力之失敗報知國聯大會、及應如何陳述此項爭議之情勢、特委會未曾議及國聯大會所可建議認爲最公允適當之解决辦法問題、因此第一次討論之結果、特委會决定推舉起草委員會、以研究草擬報告書時所提出之各種問題、起草委員會將以工作之進程、報知十九特委會、起草委員會以十九特委會主席（比國希孟）及法德西班牙瑞典瑞士英與捷克共九國代表組成之、十九特委會之其他會員、亦得將其所願提出之任何建議、書面送交起草委員會、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨十九國委員會開會後、瑞典代表藍治語記者云、委員會内大都堅持「必須李頓報告書站立在自己脚上、」其意即謂報告書内應包含最近事實、不當僅就李頓所報告者而止」、至今日會中討論者、大部份屬於進行方法、藍氏並證實國聯秘書廳提出之報告草案、即衆稱「德魯蒙方式」者、雖經中國代表反對指爲過於軟弱、現將爲起草委員會工作根據、</p>
<p>又據另一消息、今日會議時對於應否擬兩種報告、討論頗久、若干代表以爲應有一報告、聲明努力調解之失敗、並釋明其原委、另一報告則根據盟約第十五欵第四節陳述事實與委員會建議、嗣會中對此問題、仍爭議未决、乃移交草擬委員會自行决定、此外委員會對於報告書之性質、亦略有討論、其主要問題、即在是否僅將李頓報告書首八章原文叙入、抑當根據此八章就重要事實重加叙述、俾可側重於其中認爲較重要之各節、旋亦以會中衆議紛紜、决定移交起草委員會解决、並訓令起草委員會對於各代表意見、應先加考慮、</p>
<p>再數國代表尤其大國代表、主張由一併授權起草委員會、草擬十九國委員會之建議、但各小國代表由捷外長皮尼士領袖竭力反對、力主非俟將來十九國委員會再予方針後、不能草擬建議、爭辯久之、卒從小國主張、訓令起草委員會須俟十九國委員會再開會議、討論國聯對於滿案之判斷、並將此問題切實解决後、始行草擬建議、</p>
<p>現聞起草委員會將立即開始工作、至其主席一職、希孟與瑞士代表莫泰俱拒絶担任、故十九國委員會决定聽起草委員會自行推舉、至十九國委員會下屆開會期、今日尙未决定、或者即在星期三或星期四、但須視起草委員會進行以爲斷、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨十九國委員會開會時、英外部次官艾登在會塲極爲活動、而其態度亦能使小國完全滿意、更可注意者、在十九國委員會最近五次會議中、英代表莫不居爲全塲領袖、其他大國則法國似較少活動、德國更少貢獻、意國則幾常守靜默、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨十九特委會所考慮之草報告、係秘書處所擬之稿、内分三叚、㈠歷史、㈡結論、㈢意見、建議問題留諸將來、以待十九特委會之指導、歷史部分包括國聯根據大會與行政院所通過决議案與聞此項爭議、以及此項爭議與歐洲方面有關的其他各點之事件、至於與遠東方面有關者、則多取材於李頓報告書、英代表對此雖提出建議、以爲採用李頓報告書原文、較諸另起爐灶、更覺適合實際法代表瑪錫格里贊成英代表比議、但會衆卒贊成自撰報告、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>於我毫無裨益</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯對東北問題、急轉直下、使日人爲之驚駭、緣十六月來、日本一面以延宕手段、與國聯周旋、一面在滿洲積極軍事佈置、袒日如西門彼出身律師、可爲任何有錢勢者辯護、然因日本無意接受調解、在盟約第十一節第三段規定之下、亦覺愛莫能助、最近日本對於調解所提出之修正案包含諸項、故意使國聯不能放鬆、松岡此來大吹大擂、儼然舉世皆爲童駿、愚弄秘書長之不足、且欲愚弄十九委會、故對於國聯、除拒絶美俄參加、是否放鬆議案案其他條件之詢問、初則諉爲東京訓令未到、以已之提案爲嘗試、繼而嘗試失敗、又謂該提案已得政府同意、朝三暮四、信義盡失、國聯至此、始知委曲求全、仍無效果、且覺爲日所愚弄、故毅然放棄調解希望、而遵盟約第十五條第四段之規定、起草報告、但報告内容如何、大國必仍袒護日本、聯盟有此勇氣宣布日本破壞盟約否、尙屬疑問、即使聯盟爲本身利害、竟能判决是非、然報告終屬一紙空文、實際毫無裨益、我國雖能藉此獲得法律道德上之援助、仍在决心自救、以舉國一致之精神、積極軍事抵抗與經濟自衛、假使因此再加日本以一種壓迫、各國當不致漠視無睹、當此緊急關頭、國人惟有强硬對日、庶幾促國聯不再走入岐途、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>（東京）十九國委員會將决定適用第十五條四項、日本外務當局對此觀察如下、苟無新提案、總會當然採用第四項、然日本政府早有覺悟、並不或何等痛癢、故無急於撤回代表、並退出國聯之必要、惟若國聯於决定第四項勸告案之時、㈠破壞日本政府主張中日直接交涉、及不許第三國加入之原則時、㈠解决紛爭始終主張依李頓報告書否認「滿洲國」之獨立時、則斷然採退出國聯之手續、若國聯不蔑視日本之立塲、日本爲維持世界和平起見、將更熱心啓各國之蒙、至採用第四項感困難者非日本、乃中國及國聯、故中國今後之出路、極堪重視、（二十三日電通社電）</p>

<p>（紐約）紐約論壇導報評論日本内田外相在議會演說、尤側重於日本自認爲遠東和平之保護者一層、謂内田演說、其意似謂凡國際間連日本在内、前此所訂一切協定公約、其用意雖在保障和平、顧不能符合日軍閥願望、畀日本在警衛遠東上完全判斷與行動之自由者、今後必須視爲陳舊無用、所以推内田之意、凱洛格非戰公約與其他旨在保障世界和平之協定、今後必須認爲陳舊無用、第日本之自任爲遠東之警察、恐尙須待日後之重行確定云云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日外相一月二十一日在國會之演說、引起此間不美滿之批評、巴黎時報謂如此說明之日本政策、固合於日本一般利益、但如何實施、如何可與國聯根本原則相合、則猶未可知也云、自由報謂日外相演詞中含有俄日邦交中驚人進步之意、遠東時局或將因以發生實在而重要之變化、日本現已鑒於英國政策中之未知數量、而轉向於俄國云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c21">航空救國　穗 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>談到救國。當前誠然是千頭萬緒。不知從何處說起。不過努力發展航空。至少也要算是救國工作底最切實的一端。現代的戰鬥。已從平面的改作立體的了。這就是說現代的戰爭其决定勝負之機。已經不在陸地。不在海面。而是在空間。飛機的破壞力。是較之任何戰鬥器都大。他可以使都市立刻變爲墟墓。可以使一切的海陸軍無所施其威力。更可以决最後之勝負　俄頃。我們只要一回憶一二八滬戰時。日軍的爆擊機和戰鬥機所給予我們的蹂躪和恐怖。就可以知道這裏所說的。並不是誇大之言。不僅是一二八之役是如此。東北義勇軍的受創。與其說是由於日本的重砲坦克車等利器之壓迫。毌寗說是由於飛機之轟炸。所以在目前。我們簡直武斷地說。「没有航空便没有國防。」</p>
<p>然而日本的飛機。在目前列强中還是最幼稚的。在明治二十年時。日本才有二宮忠八氏研究飛機。到明治二十三年十二月。才作成第一架飛機模型。僅能飛越五間平房的短距離。到大正初元。這才比較的有了新式的飛機之演習。直至歐戰開始時。歐洲各國已採用飛機爲主要的戰鬥武器。日本還僅有四架。居然就在我們的青島與德軍作戰時。盡了點綴的職能。誰知這十數年中。他們舉國上下。竭盡全力提倡。終於建立起了當前不可輕侮的空軍實力。這當然是由於他們根本認清了空軍在國防上的重大價値。</p>
<p>現在我們來一檢視我們的航空實力罷。這才夠使人心寒胆裂。啊在這樣一片龐大的國土上。不說進攻的航空。就是防守的航空。也是一無設備。不僅是各省各地如是。即首都的空防。事實上亦無不如是。那没如果說没有航空便没有國防。這一句話是確實的。我們還有國防可言嗎。我國的前途。還堪設想嗎。雖然過去的東三省。也算有過數日架飛機。但在九一八瀋變時。竟無抵抗地全數資爲敵用了。</p>
<p>日本一直到現在。他們對於航空之建設。還是孜孜不遺餘力的在東京大坂名古屋等地。闢置了不少的地下室。高射砲。聽音機等。去年一年内曾演習兩次大規模的防空戰。就是在民間。也是同樣的狂熱。陸海軍人多自動捐助愛國機報國機。其他國民團體或個人。更多踴躍獻呈國產機。編入空軍之中一九三二年六月十九日。有少年學生節省糖果零錢。購置軍用機。「中學生號。」「小學生號。」其他民間捐助之愛國機。直至現有爲止。已達四十餘架。爲了侵略。他們對於航空還是這樣的努力。我們爲了自衛。不更應急起直追嗎。</p>
<p>這次上海各界。自昨日起舉行航空救國宣傳週。打算在此一週内努力宣傳。使人民對於航空的價値。都有深切的認識。我門認爲這種工作。是具有重大意義的。眞的。「没有航空便没有國防。」而且當敵國空軍蹂躪某一都市時能與之周旋者。亦只有空軍。所以我們認爲建設航空發展航空。是我國當前最迫切的工作。我們希望在最短期間。全國每一縣。至少能有一架飛機。</p>
<p>不過。我們更希望以後無論是軍隊或軍械。都屬於「國有。」而有爲「私有。」因爲「私有」是不足以利國。而反足以禍國。對於發展航空。我們的希望也是這樣。</p>

<p>我國文化優於他族</p>
<p>侵略民族每至同化</p>
<p>國人應恢復自信心</p>
<p>中央社云、中委長溥泉、因長公子及女公子赴法遊學、即將出國、故特由洛南下話别、於昨晨抵滬、午後四時許、赴市府訪吳市長、中央社記者、適亦往訪、得晤談甚久、茲詳述於後、</p>
<p>前方氣盛　張氏談、此次日宼進襲榆關、駐兵力予抵抗、士氣甚盛、每聞命令、輒爭先殺敵、精神甚佳、段芝泉先生此次應蔣委員長邀請、南來商談、此種團結爲國之精神、至可嘉佩、本人在平、並晤及吳子玉將軍、渠對鄰日之暴行、至爲憤慨、渠且表示、暫不離平他去、亦决不至爲他人利用、如有機緣、當效古之岳武穆、爲國盡忠云、故外界對渠之種種謠傳、均不足信、此種現象、自可慶幸、但須全國人民、恢復自信心耳、</p>
<p>歷史光榮　我國歷史上之受外人侵入者、有遼金元清四次、我國土人民、雖受凌辱、但其對於我國之文化、則仍景仰不止、馴至同化於我、此種事實、實我民族歷史之光榮、亦且我歷史哲學之原素、國人每誇我國爲世界之天堂、此種言論、雖出於過誇、要即自信力之表現耳、現在國人之自信心、漸至消滅、甚且妄自菲薄、對於一切、均覺自不如人、國家民族之危機、實在於此、我國民族、發祥於西安、余十年前遊歐時、見各國文化之優美、民族之偉大、對國人自視爲世界之天堂、每覺過誇、及此次往遊西安、得瞻仰我民族發源地之文化及其創設之偉大、自信之力、乃又恢復、西安洛陽、在國之中、交通甚爲便利、國人能前往遊覽、始能發現我國文化之優美及偉大、而自信心當可即恢復、是則外宼何足懼、即至國土被辱、民族决不致滅絶、或且能同化外來民族也、</p>
<p>開發西北　西安洛陽旣係我國民族文化之中心、一切建設、當至重要、西安設市、已有决議、洛陽之建設、亦在籌劃中、洛陽現定爲文化中心、中央軍校分校之創設、已積極進行、而該地普通敎育、尙甚完美、高等敎育、則待計劃發展、該地交通、自上海至洛陽、二十餘小時即可到達、他處自隴海路西段完成後、則前往西安、亦僅二十餘小時耳、該地民性强悍、而諄厚古樸、其地雖尙在農村經濟發展期中、惟以土地肥沃、故民生優裕、其主要物產、爲棉花·尙有小規模之手工業、國人能前往該處投資、其發展自可期望也、張氏談至此、吳市長即提議組織西北協會、以考察研究入手、獎掖滬上人士之前往開發云、此議不久當可成事實、滬上人士、當亦加以樂予協助也、</p>
<p>科學救國　張氏又談、救國之方、須求實質上之建設、吳稚暉先生所提馬達救國、實中時弊、中國之敎育、現在實已至破產地步、負其咎者、乃係彼等高唱哲學文學等之理論家、及世界大同等之夢想家也、二十年前、余與吳先生在歐洲晤面時、渠即主張科學救國、謂每人能戴工人帽子、則中國庶可强盛、二十年來、主張不稍更變、其主張未見實行、乃至有今日之現象、故余對吳先生之欽佩在此、余之子女、此次赴法、進工業學校、希望能成一工人回國、以盡建設國家之力、</p>

<p>惟有集中全國財智建設空軍</p>
<p>本市各界航空救國宣傳週、昨爲舉行之第一日、除市府各局處及各團體分别開會演講外、並由市長吳鐵城、於下午七時、假亞美廣播臺播音演講、茲將吳氏演講詞、記錄如下、</p>
<h3 id="c103">空前厄運 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>中央爲紀念去歲一二八滬戰起見、特議决本月二十三日起至二十八日止、爲航空宣傳週、這航空宣傳週的意義、就是在使全國民衆、都能深知航空救國之重要、而中國民族、亦可因全國民衆的覺悟、空軍建設的完成、得其復興自强的新機、兄弟今天承各界推選、担任第一次播音演講、也就是要把這一點深刻而重要的意義、普告於吾全國親愛的同胞、中國民族的現階段、誰都知道、已經深深的陷於空前而嚴重的厄運、在一般民衆的情緒上、大槪都已感覺到這一個生死存亡民族鬥爭的開端、已經没有推諉和避免的餘地、其實中國的國難、又何嘗是始於今日、更何嘗是源於東北呢、我們關懷國運、愛護民族的總理、在他民族主義的演講裏、早已告詔我們說、『我們現在所處的地位、是生死關頭、中國的民族、不久便要滅亡、統結我們民族所受的禍害、一是受政治力壓迫、二是受經濟的壓迫、三是受列强人口增加的壓迫、這三件外來的大禍、已經臨頭、我們民族處於現在的地位、是很危險的、譬如、就第一件的禍害說、政治力亡人之國家、是一朝可以做得到的、中國此時受列强政治力的壓迫、隨時都可以亡國、今日不知道明日的生死、因爲我們的海陸軍、和各險要地方、没有預備國防、外國隨時可以衝入、隨時可以亡中國、要是更危險的、我們這一個酷愛和平的民族、在這種危險的局勢之下、大家仍是漠不關心、不事準備、甚至因爲「兵兇戰危、」大家不要武力、把兵事厭棄到了極度、這種「居危偷安、」和「投鼠忌器、」的心理和態度、實在是國民思想上最大的弱點、中國民族莫大的危機、國於天地、必有與立、國家没有了强力的基礎、民族便失其生命的保障、「古者國之大事、唯祀與戎、」即如主張仁愛感化的孔子、也認「足食足兵、」爲維繫民族生命的基本原則、我們如果不能在民主主義的原則下、企圖「足食、」以養我們的民族、在民族主義的原則下、企圖「足兵、」以保我們的民族、則非但違悖了總理精深的遺敎、恐將無以圖存於今日民族鬥爭極端尖銳的世界、</p>
<h3 id="c104">迎頭趕上 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>我們如果要在這樣危險的局勢下、企圖民族生命的綿延、第一應該革除歷來萎靡不振、厭棄武力的心理、澈底的認清民族處境的艱危、勇敢地、站在民族鬥爭的前線、充實民族戰鬥的勇氣、增益民族自衛的力量、竭全民的智來研究國防、竭全民的仁來建設國防、竭全民的勇來充實國防、但是國防建設、不是一朝一夕之事尤其以我國疆土之廣、海岸之長、而且我們沿海的要塞、或因條約的壓迫、或因財力的限制、素無海軍防守海岸、同時在都市方面、特别是在各省城市、一些防空的設備也没有、一旦國家有事、便要内外受敵、無法防守、在如此急迫的形勢之下、實在已没有我們從容建設的餘地、而實有「亟起直追迎頭趕上」之必要、現在「迎頭趕上」的國防計劃、就是空防、空防在現代軍事上、在歐戰以及我國近年幾次戰事的經騐上、是一種最經濟最有效、最易辦、最迅捷的國防計劃、從前的軍事家、以海岸爲第一防線、自空軍的威力表顯了以後、海防已失其作用、而空軍已成爲現代國防計劃的中心、空防旣經濟有效而重要、對於國防素無基礎的中國、實更爲適宜而迫切、</p>
<h3 id="c105">空防重要 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>空軍不但易於編設、易於見效、在軍事上、又有先發制人的功效、而其作戰的能率、尤爲任何海陸軍所不及、兵法說、『知彼知己』『百戰百勝、』飛機就可以偵察敵人的陣地、攝取戰壕的位置、探視敵營的虚實、至其破壞敵陣、搖動軍心的能力、尤爲猛烈、國人試思淞滬之役即可徵信、所以法將福煦說、『在未來第二次世界大戰中、最活躍而有力的、就是飛機、』將來戰鬥的陣容、必係大規模的飛機隊、馳騁天空、而他們的破壞能力、尤遠勝於海陸軍、可使敵國軍心渙散、解除武裝、所以將來的空軍、實係戰爭勝敗的主動力、</p>
<h3 id="c106">各國實力 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>歐戰以後、各國鑒於空軍勢力的偉大、都集中國力、集中財力、從事於空中的建設、據一九二九年的統計、各國空軍的設備、已有驚人的進步、其中尤以法國的最著、法國空軍人員、有四萬餘名、飛機有一萬六千餘架、其次爲美國、有六七千架、英國亦有六千來架、空軍預算、有二千萬鎊之多、俄國有四千餘架、意大利有三千餘架、德國與日本、約有二千架、而日本的學生、且有空軍的軍事訓練、其重視空軍、尤足令我驚惕、其他小國、如波蘭·西班牙·都有五百來架、瑞士·比利時·亦有四百多架、環顧世界、惟有我們老大的中國、事事落後、海陸軍備、旣付闕如、而空軍設備、非但於數量上、與列强比較、幾等於零、而且在速率上、幾僅及人三分之一、甚至二分之一、我國飛機速力、每小時僅一百多啓羅、他國則有二七○啓羅、上升力約十分鐘三千米突、如此在空中飛翔作戰、我機徒供敵人之捕捉而已、</p>
<h3 id="c107">集中建設 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>在這裏、在這時、我們全國的民衆、應該澈底的認識世界、局勢的恐怖、認識民族處境的艱危、認識民族當前的急圖、勇敢地、站在民族鬥爭的前線、充實民族鬥爭的勇氣、增益民族自衛的力量、要知道空軍建設、是現代國防計劃的中心、空軍建設、是『迎頭趕上』國防的計劃、空軍建設、最宜於軍備落後的中國、空軍建設、是一種最有效·最易辦·最經濟·最猛力·的國防計劃、唯有建設空軍、才能鞏固我們的國防、唯有發展空軍、才能挽救民族的厄運、我們要集中全國的智力、來建設空軍、集中全國的財力、來發展空軍、</p>
<h3 id="c108">團結方能禦侮 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>吳鐵城演講　昨晨市政府舉行紀念週、市長吳鐵城主席、率領全體職員、行禮如儀後、并作報告、其詞如下、我國古語有云、多難興邦、又曰無敵國外患者國恒亡、大凡一國飽更患難、橫受凌侮、往往能使疲玩散漫的民族、由刺激而警敏、由警敏而團結、近百年來外方之壓迫威脅紛乘不已、國民已因刺激而漸次警敏、近來國難愈亟、遂能由警敏而漸次趨於團結、此在吾國上下已有不少例證、而尤以段芝泉先生南來、爲最可慶幸之事、蓋段先生締造民國、維護國家、人所共仰、惟久已頣情泉石、不聞政事、近頃來京、與首都黨政領袖、共商國事、此舉實足以樹全國之楷模、變世界之觀感、令人景仰無已、日内即將蒞滬、吾人對於段先生此來、應表示極誠敬之歡迎、且深信此精誠之團結、影響於國家前途者甚鉅云云、</p>
<p>張之江談話　中央國術館館長張之江氏、昨晨語中央社記者云、本人此次晉京謁蔣委員長、專係貢獻關於國防上意見與策略、因國防不固而禦外侮、實屬危險、惟鞏固國防、民衆須協助政府進行、則收效自速、倘專靠政府、自必勢孤力弱、故深盻國人同心協力、一致襄助政府禦侮、現　華北形勢、危迫達於極點、圖存之策、惟有武力抵抗、茲華北將士如雲、希望主將竭力籌劃一切、達到收回失地目的、兵法云、主孰有道、將孰有能、深盻華北主將張學良振作精神、堅持抵抗、馮玉祥氏現仍寄居張垣、對日軍進犯、極表憤慨、故迭電本人表示决心殺敵、至傳馮將南下、則未有所聞云、</p>

<p>｜亮君來信｜</p>
<p>我今年二十歲了、身體自信是很强壯的一個青年。三年前卒業初級中學，嗣因家境清寒，以致輟學，經友介紹，得入某機關服務，終日抄繕文件、看人家嘴臉，十數小時的工作，每月總算拿到三十塊錢，然而家中父母弟妹，計共五人，父老弟幼，一家生計，全憑我雙肩擔負。家中與我個人，任是如何省儉，總覺不敷開支，倘若一旦發生意外事故，那就更難應付，我秉性不願乞人之憐，現在常想找一些副業做做｜晨間有空可以帮人抄寫，記帳｜但乏人援引。又擬按月就零用中再扣省一二元儲蓄，以備不時之需，但事實上也難於實行。前顧茫茫，我究竟怎樣來應付這生計問題呢？其次我的職業，上已述明爲書記生涯，每感不合我的個性。蓋工作之苦，甚於牛馬，又常遭人輕視。倘使不幹、則家庭境况如此，又到何處去尋飯吃？我曉得，這都是因乏專門技術與學騐所致。所以我現在急於想學一點專門技能和學問，如會計，簿記，測繪等｜惟爲工作時間及經濟能力所限制，總難如願以償。而且，現在求其眞能授我以實學者亦甚少，縱然有補習學校，我也不敢輕試！這又怎樣補救？</p>
<p>答：足下來書，雖說提出兩個問題，其實只是整個的社會的經濟結搆問題，不過我們答覆，却要分做如下三項：㈠職工待遇問題。在現社會的組織之中，階級的分限極嚴，上層人員對於下層職工之虐待，眞是極普遍的現象，你若果對於這人海茫茫的都市社會的各個機關的待遇，還有選擇彼善於此的希望，那就是幻想，因爲天下老鴉一般黑，這不是什麽道德問題，而是整個的經濟問題，整個的社會問題。最好：一方面暫時忍耐做去：一方面大家職工聯絡起來·藉謀改善的方策。若是眼光僅注在一身一家，那就永遠不會翻身。㈡家庭生活問題。你這樣一個年紀輕輕的初中畢業生如何能擔負五口之家的生活？煞是可憐：這在將來社會變革的國家，或國家消滅後的社會，自然不成問題；因爲在這種社會中，所有工農貧民的幼童的敎育都應歸社會擔負，老弱孤獨廢疾者皆由社會爲之扶養。然而在中國，甚至在歐美的極高度的資本主義的國家，都辦不到這一層，不但辦不到這一層，反而一方面日日在造富，一方面却日日在造窮，這是現在私有制度的生產社會之一種必然的現象。由此看來，整個問題不解决，你的家庭問題，也就很難有解决的希望。㈢求學問題。你一天旣然做到夜的抄寫苦工，自然在經濟上，時間上似乎都不再有繼續學業的可能；然而「」專門技術與學識」都是要從實際生活的奮鬭中歷練修養出來的。若果善於利用時機，所謂「忙裏偷閑」去讀書，去補習「技術」與其　學識，那也不是没有成功希望的；會計，簿記與測繪，你旣已有初中程度，自己專研，也不是絶對做不到的。至於其　各種普通常識的修養，亦只需抽暇多讀一點書，自然也會開卷有益。在實踐生活中讀書比之在學校中讀書，其親切有味，獲益良多，眞不可以言語形容。本館爲一般人業餘修養起見，已在大陸商塲設有流通圖書館一所，使一般青年店員及職工都有滿足他們智識要求的機會，你亦不妨去借點書來看看。補習學校好得眞少，假使你能努力自修的話，似乎不必去嘗試，白花錢花時光。</p>

<p>不但如是、民國十八年國民政府公布之　中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針」第五條中、曾規定師範敎育於「可能性範圍内、使其獨立設置」、二十一年敎育部擬訂並經立法院二一四次會議通過之「師範學校法」、（註二）亦經敎育部於二十二年一月十九日公布、令各省自本年度下學期起依此辦理、而去年十二月三中全會通過之「改革敎育案」、更認「師資敎育」爲重要敎育目標之一、旣確定師範敎育獨立之精神、且於師範生之待遇及服務等、皆略有規定、議决原案如次、</p>
<p>「一中等師範敎育機關、分簡易師範學校、師範學校等、均由政府辦理、二師範學校應脫離中學而單獨設立、三現有之師範大學、應力求整理與改善使其組織課程訓育各項、切合於訓練中等學校師資之目的、以别於普通大學、且與師範學校等力謀聯絡、四大學設師資訓練班、凡大學畢業生、願任敎師者、應入該班加修敎育功課一年、以備中等學校敎師之選、五師範學校及師範大學槪不收學費、師範學校應以由政府供給膳宿制服爲原則、六師範學校及師範大學生鬱業完畢後、由敎育部或省敎育廳市敎育局指定地點派往服務、期滿始發給畢業證書、始得自由應聘或升學、其有規避服務或服務不盡力者取消資格、並追繳費用」、</p>

<p>一·根據師範敎育的木義、參用科學方法規定中小學師資訓練之具體目標此乃初步之至　手續、根據本國敎育宗旨、規定師資敎育的目的、得依據師資敎育的目的、規定各級敎師訓練之具體目標、步驟至爲自然、所謂具體目標者乃指用科學方法所得到之敎師應具的知識·能　力·品格·精神·理想·興趣等（註三）而言、此爲實施師資敎育及謀各級、師資訓練機關、聯絡的準則、惜屢屆討論師範學制時、尙未及此、殊爲可惜、二·一切師資訓練機關應皆以「公正」爲原則丨師範敎育爲國民敎育之母其良　關係國家前途甚鉅、以故種種敎育或可由私人承辦、而師範敎育則非由政府辦理不可、此在歐美各國業已成爲慣例、毫無問題、</p>

<p>上半時軍校居先一分下半時落後</p>
<p>全局驚險無窮兩隊時起時落</p>
<p>中央軍校籃球隊、昨晚與西青海賊劇鬥之結果、不幸以四十一比四十五差四分未曾獲勝、爲海賊所乘、空氣緊張、以致白熱化、全局驚險無窮、此起彼落、實至最後一分鐘才分勝負、當稱本季第一次之精彩表演、上半時軍校、佔先一分、二十一比二十、軍校今晚休息、明晚戰麥令、</p>
<h3 id="c172">無窮精彩 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>昨晚之一塲劇戰、其中無窮之精彩、爲本季第一次、軍校在强敵嚴防之下、能猛撲而中、李公瑜之妙射、王士選之守衛、俱稱傑作、卽中鋒黃建鼎、前二次稍呈軟弱、昨亦遠射中的數次、至於　青海賊、從未逢若是之勁敵、防守之密、得未曾有、進攻時處處荆棘、時時有執球無處投之苦、齊爾史密斯二人之投籃神妙、嘆爲觀止、雙方所有本領竭於此矣、</p>
<h3 id="c173">風波莫測 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>全局經過之變化、其中驚險、難以盡述此起彼落、無從揣測、時而平手、時而以一分上下、開賽初則軍校、佔先海賊後起、軍校又平等之、海賊再起、軍校又超出一分而勝之、此爲上半時之局勢、海賊　起、其勢猖狂、連爲所中、超出四分、最大距離、有十分之多、軍校復回攻、戰至僅落後一分、時僅餘二分鐘、不幸又爲海賊奪得四分、雖軍校再罰中一次、結果相差四分而敗、</p>
<h3 id="c174">有幸不幸 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>兩隊之强弱、海賊不過較勝毫厘、海賊有不亂統系之戰略、下半時起、突破軍校之五人聯防、爲其得勝之由、齊爾與史密斯、投籃有把握、齊爾之危險惟更大、軍校之失敗、亦可稱幸不幸耳、擲籃之機會、多於海賊、然皆差以分寸、或中於籃圈、未曾落入、或竟入籃而復出、更有王士選濳入籃下二次未中、李公瑜不少投籃、僅差一絲、不勝惋惜、軍校起手稍遲、亦爲失着、</p>
<h3 id="c175">上塲聲色 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>西青球房、上上下下、水洩不通、八時啟戰、海賊雖得跳球、仍爲軍校所得、進退數次、李公瑜在籃下一翻、球入於内、然而海賊經史密斯之一罰、齊爾之一中、三比二超出一分、軍校健兒、銳氣方盛、連罰二次而連中、李公瑜再來一球、六比三高出海賊一倍、軍勢浩蕩、全塲呼聲大起、寄無窮希望於軍校、</p>
<h3 id="c176">難分上下 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>然而海賊隨後卽至、史密斯與齊爾之互中、七比七平手之後、連加七分、竟以十四比七超出一倍、軍校絶不因之稍餒、罰中一分、黃建鼎半場遠射而中、李黃二將、再中三元、秋色平分、又是十四比十四之局面、眞是旗逢敵手、海賊見勢甚兇、急調出齊爾休息、而以小史規理進、</p>
<h3 id="c177">一分居先 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>小史規亞東竄西奔、果爲其撲入一次海賊十八比十四在前、軍校不爲稍動、再接再厲、亦連中四分、十九比十八仍在前、海賊見後防不佳、沙利文記有犯規三次、急以特拉傑入替沙利文、一轉身上半時完畢、軍校以二十一比二十勝一分、</p>

<p>下半時起、雖然黃建鼎隨手半塲一揮、投入籃内、而形勢竟從此大變、軍校保持其五人聯防之法、海賊採緩進方法、取大包圍形情、得機沿邊穿進、球角投射、五人聯防、成爲呆定、一破而破、海賊從此一帆風順、連得十三分之多、一失再失、成三十五比二二五、軍校落後十分、</p>
<h3 id="c179">急起直追 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>軍校在此突變之情勢下、急變更陣線、調瞿性存入替黃建鼎改以李公瑜跳鋒、急起直追、頓見起色、李公瑜匹馬單槍、時見直入、王士選在後策應、一球繼一球、一分近一分、果然全軍奮鬥之結果、成四十比四十一、僅僅差一分、全塲呼呌、無不怦怦然、不知自己、</p>
<h3 id="c180">最後之敗 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>海賊急呌暫息、計時報告、尙餘三分鐘、不料在此三分鐘内、軍校暫歸於失敗、白那特中後、史密斯又、羣知中宣告絶望、最後希望、由劉懦昌罰中、加上一分、成四十五比四十一、海賊獲勝、雖然、軍校已不勝難能可貴矣、</p>

<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>新與舊</p>
<p>上海是中國一切新東西的輸入口。世界新發明的東西，係論是物質的洋貨，精神的新思想，皆由幾萬噸的大郵船運進上海口來，然後販賣轉運到全中國的内地云。</p>
<p>帮助洋人推銷洋貨的中國人是「江灣渡」，帮助洋人灌輸新思想的人，現在尙未定專門名稱，將來也許呌作「洋擺渡」。因爲「洋」比「江」的包涵廣闊，所以洋擺渡比江擺渡更偉大。</p>
<p>「上海得風氣之先·」這句話已成一般人的口頭禪，上海人亦以此自負。這就是洋擺渡努力的結果。</p>
<p>上海地方事事新鮮。上海人的一舉一動，一顰一笑，都可以做内地人的標本。「上海派」就是代表「新派」。將來的新辭典，也許將上海二字當作「新」字解釋。</p>
<p>前幾年上海人穿緊口鞋，鄕下人吃喜酒去，腰裏也要掛一個白銅「鞋葉拔」。上海人吸了香烟，鄉下的潮烟筒都霉爛了。上海女人穿了旗袍，鄉下女人進城也就不敢穿裙子了。</p>
<p>上海人死了，很有不少睡盒子式外國棺材的。然而上海死人出喪丨除了敎友以外丨仍用許多掮旗打傘的　三，表現出十足的封建色彩。</p>
<p>在二十世紀的柏油馬路上，排列着幾千年的儀仗，新頭腦的上海人並不覺行不調和，内地人見了却很爲奇怪！</p>
<p>上海人新了一世，下到死後才露出舊的狐狸尾巴來。</p>
<h3 id="c185">貧與人生 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>愈是貧愈是藝術化丨</p>
<p>記得哲學家叔本華對於貧窮有過新奇而雋妙的闡述，他說：要訓練人生，只有貧窮；一個人在貧窮之中，方能體騐到人世的甜酸苦辣，愈是貧，愈是藝術化：因愈貧愈能認明世界的眞面目。最後叔本華還下過這樣一個斷語：「每個人生應當受貧窮的洗禮」。</p>
<p>就我個人方面說，爲了貧窮也曾讚美過人世，世曾咒詛過人世！</p>
<p>我有一位叔叔，他對於人生偶然的貧富，看得異常的達觀和透澈，他說：貧的人並不是個個才識薄弱的人，很多是懷才不遇；至於當的人，並不是個個靠他眞才實學而致富的，大都是靠了幸運。所以凡是有人向我叔叔借錢的人，只要叔叔認爲有借的必要的人，則無論多少一槪給他。叔叔最反對寫借據的，他說旣然肯借，何必寫借據，寫借據是看不起來借債的人，如果他有信用的，他以後一定可來還，否則就算送給他好了，因爲借的時候，總有相當的感情，始肯借給他的。這是因爲叔叔也從貧窮中過來，體騐過貧窮的滋味，有過貧窮的訓練，所以對於貧窮有獨到的見解！</p>
<p>似乎還有一位先哲曾對於貧窮，亦有過明澈的昭示：他說若要交肝瞻的知友，要在貧窮失意的時候；到了富貴得意的時候，只有些酒肉徵逐的朋友！眞是至理名言。每見世上不少陷於貧窮中的人，呻吟着悲苦和懊惱，我以爲太愚了！上帝對於貧窮的人的賦與，並不薄弱；使你有瞻肝的知友，可以溫馨人生；給你以冷酷與無情，可以體騐人生；爲了貧窮，增加了不少向上的努力，爲了貧窮，絶跡了紙迷金醉的塲所，呵呵；貧窮不是最藝術化的嗎？</p>

<p>— 江萍</p>
<p>｜從揚州屠城說起｜</p>
<p>據說明末揚州屠城，城裏的居民有十多萬，而逢人便殺的滿清兵士僅有五百個；五百個人屠殺了十天之久，竟没有遇到抵抗。這眞是令人咋舌的事！咋舌不僅在於屠殺的兇，更且因爲屠殺的太容易了。我們想念已往的痛史，悲傷中還不由得不帶着幾分羞恥。</p>
<p>我們都會這樣想；假使當時揚州城裏成千成萬的人家，每家都派遣一兩個壯丁來和五百個清兵週旋一下，結果無論如何，總不至於那樣悽慘。</p>
<p>「九一八」，「一二八」，甚至榆關陷落後，日本浪人殺戮中國人民之慘酷，也正和滿清兵士屠殺揚州彷彿。他們來時，常是五六個一隊。跑進一條街巷，愛殺那個便殺那個，街巷裏居民的生命，都握在他們的掌握中。雖是居民的數目比日浪人多過千倍百倍，可是只聽見五六個在那裏逞兇，從不曾聽見過千倍百倍的表現一點兒力量；有許多都是在圖僥倖逃脫之時喪了性命。朋友，與其這樣地死去，爲甚不大家集合起來抵抗一下呢！抵抗誠然是不免犧牲，但這犧牲是有代價的犧牲，至少可以挫掉幾分敵人的兇燄；說起面了兩個字來，也比較地光榮得多啊！</p>

<p>｜四季的感想｜</p>
<p>據說蜆是一種　自經死的蟲，那麽　正是一隻未成熟的蜆。</p>
<p>自己並不存着一些悲觀，祗感到一切太空泛，缺少活潑而已。</p>
<p>春天到冬天，一年年地循環着過去。從母愛樣的春天到父樣嚴厲的冬天，氣候是時刻地在變化，可是我一些也没有體會到。</p>
<p>人們說春天到了，眞的，春天到了，啊，祇更增添了我的懊惱；陰重的雷聲催醒樹蟲的生命，復活了人們的青春，但忘掉喚醒了昨夜深刻的惡夢。我踏着碧綠的淺草，舉着柳條，追尋那停止了的鳥聲；我又走出那輕飄着的柳林，送那將沉落的日影。</p>
<p>酷烈的日光到臨，這是夏。日子更爲沉悶，但是這樣地悠長，我眞想做一個追逐太陽的夸父，趕着這太陽，早些向西。啊，熱的夏季，是這樣地炎熱，但扇熱了整個的大地，郤不能扇熱我冷掉的心窩。</p>
<p>看草木的又將變衰，這是我一生的象徵吧！秋，一般悲哀的。</p>
<p>峭寒的冬天，似飛沙的雪花，散漫地飛灑，它遮瞞了人間的黑暗，給人們建築了一些光明。整個地一年，祗有這一季給予了我一些安慰，我常想，踏着雪，在這冷峭的冬夜，找到一些同情。</p>
<p>啊，我不煩惱，反正這不是煩惱。</p>
<p>得了解自己痛苦的，這不是煩惱。最煩惱的是自己捉不着本身的痛苦，倘使我能找到我所煩惱的解答，我將捉住這一點，解除這束縛着我内心的網。但，······期望遠了。</p>

<p>第二，是他們只管駕駛，不管收拾車子。因爲收拾車子，未免近於下流，該由一班Ｃ鄕就地的短衣鄕下人承乏。所以一部車子，非到奄奄一息，病入膏肓，不肯退隱林下。第三，是他們到晚上，旣然無公可辦，只好賭錢消遣，又通夜麻雀，是很普通的事。丢下骨牌，就去駕駛，雖然指尖的感覺，特别靈敏，免不得有幾張洞口瘟的中風白牌，在眼前晃耀，於是有幾個倒霉的旅客，偶然也受中風白牌之賜，而做了深閨夢裏人。以致Ｃ鄕一班知命的君子，終要莊嚴肅穆的敎訓作客他鄕的青年：</p>
<p>『你們年青人，只曉得快。哼！Ｃ鄕的汽車，萬不可輕於嘗試啊』不過紅葉感到見父親的病容，比自己生命的安全，來得重要。這些報紙的紀載，也只好當他是例外。拖鞋皮的中山裝站長，將綠旗一揮，七八個丨也許近十二三個丨短衣的鄕下人，開始手伸着，手推動這坐足二十六客的汽車，一寸一寸，往前走。一時，邪許之聲，如入山陰道上。</p>
<p>如果永遠是這樣陸地行舟，倒再也安全不過。可惜推了百步左右，車頭居然軋軋而鳴，冒了一陣烟，便絶塵而駛。車後黃沙滾滾，車前白烟騰騰。這條路，大約造得太好，所以天公密密加圈。車子一快，同時有種助胃健脾的動作，上窮碧落，下及黃泉，紅葉的草帽，在車頂上碰了兩回釘子，鋒積盡喪。</p>
<p>車行一點又四十分鐘，Ｃ鄕在望了！青青的山；欹危的城堞；疊得又整齊，又美觀，一座一座，像小山樣的酒罎；奉旨敦建，一座一座的石牌坊；都是Ｃ鄕的特徵。特别可愛的是這種酒罎山。一個個又圓又滑，像光明寳塔樣擺列着。紅葉老佩服着Ｃ鄕的酒商人，他們具有這種驚人的技巧；很想得機會親眼看他們一個個的堆疊一次，可是終不曾遇到過。</p>
<p>從汽車站到紅葉的家，還得坐三十分鐘的黃包車。紅葉在車上，忽然感到一種莫名其妙的寒意。離家愈近，心裏愈覺發慌。暴風雨的侵襲，彷彿就在眼底。直等遠遠的望見門口黑漆的牆門，寫着『招貼即扯』的灰牆壁，並没有什麽異樣的標幟，心才定了一半。㈢</p>

<p>一回兒，伊點好　脂擦過粉，笑着對我一望「　喲姐姐，對你不起，我預備上城裏去看媽媽，祇是我不能陪你同去吃中飯了，你不致於介意吧？」伊會說好一些抱歉的話。</p>
<p>像這種情形，也不知經過了多少次。</p>
<p>可是伊自己常喜歡提議一同去吃飯，同時還不該帶别人一起去，像上咖啡館囉，看影戲囉，也都是如此，</p>
<p>「你爲什麽和瓊小姐一起去？快丢开伊吧，你不是喜歡胡蝶主演的電影麽？讓我陪你去。」伊把持一切地說着。</p>
<p>倘若是你在一個晚上，做着很忙的事，伊就會跑來東拉西扯的講一些話，說什麽伊覺着這幾天過着十分没有興趣，又預定好了十天期，在這一個星期三晚上，約我到伊家吃晚飯。</p>
<p>我就等着這天了，馬先生請我去跳舞，我也回了，林小姐約我去看電影也不去。我收拾好了一切，那時辰鐘已噹噹地敲了七點，伊果然來了，一進門便道：「吃飯要改期了，改明天吧，因爲今天另和潘小姐有了約會了。」</p>
<p>伊還有更讓人不痛快的事呢，就像到了約好的這天，伊和别人同來了，却說：「我和何太太去了，你不必去吧，你不要介意呢。」這些話，讓人聽了多難受呢？</p>
<p>有一回，我因爲上先施買東西，順便去望望伊，伊並没有和我說什麽話，等我買好東西回了家，伊跑到我家來看我，却說伊母親要買一件衛生衫，伊没有功夫陪，非要我陪了去不可像這位安小姐實在一些也不懂得交際的道理自然是這社會上像安小姐那樣的人也很多呢！</p>

<p>我常到朋友家裏去觀察，有幾家佈置得是十分精緻的，處處都能引起人的興趣。自然是精緻的佈置，在在要化費很多很多的錢有許多人經濟困難，力量所辦不到的，但是無論是怎麽樣的簡單，總以收拾清潔爲第一，因爲一間屋子，佈置好了能引起人守在家裏的興味。亂七八糟的家裏，常常能使丈夫在家裏坐不住。這裏有一幅屋子裏佈置的圖，一切東西都是十分簡單，這差不多人人所辦得到的。所以屋子裏的美觀，不一定是要十分奢侈纔能佈置得好。簡單清潔，也有一種美觀的興味。我想這層問題，是個個家庭裏的主婦所應當研究的。</p>

<p>— 許</p>
<p>不知是因爲今晚的飯菜不大適口呢，這是因爲他的心境不大好呢，　　吃了兩碗開水泡飯之後，便把筷子在桌上一丢，碗向台邊一送，說聲「不吃了！」</p>
<p>今天是一九三三年的一月六號，天空陰陰的，瓦　前終日不斷的滴着霉水，坐在家裏也有些悶人，再加上是正月的關係，報　工人也停了工，我們簡直像被嚴　在一個荒廟裏同世間隔斷的樣子。可是，今天却來了一個消息，說是山海關已經失守，天津也已經搖動；這眞有些使人哭笑不得。不抵抗將軍，是不抵抗到底的吧：長期抵抗的政府，是要長期的唱着長期抵抗的調子吧？山海關旣然被佔去，天津還能靠得住嗎？北京還能靠得住嗎？華北失守後之南京，還能有什麽掙扎嗎：啊，亡國奴是做成了，啊，又來了一　國難！</p>
<p>我們的呌喊有什麽用呢？我們有什麽路好走呢？想起了這一些不容易解决的問題，心中便覺得有些啼笑皆非的樣子。</p>
<p>「又是國難期間？」</p>
<p>吃飯的時候，我們都没有話說。可是，等到他把筷子在桌上一丢，說聲不吃了之後，我們的談　又漸漸的轉過來了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？我問：「你想絶食嗎？」</p>
<p>「縮食。縮食救國！」</p>
<p>「上一次，王××不是絶食嗎？一下子就名滿天下。」</p>
<p>「哈！」</p>
<p>「眞有趣，你餓死了，誰來睬你！」</p>
<p>「其實，他還是在吃的。北平的學生到南京來，他還在火車上吃東西呢？」</p>
<p>「這才是好法子，爲了這種事情，眞的餓死是犯不着！不過，要出出風頭，到是一個適當的時候。」</p>
<p>「你也可以來一下，上海專電立刻可以給你豋起來，某大學的某某敎授，痛榆關之失守，傷國事之日非，已於卽日起開始絶食，電促當局，出兵抵抗······」</p>
<p>「眞可來一下呢！」</p>
<p>「并且，立刻便會有新聞記者前來訪問。」</p>
<p>「立刻會有人來替你的做起居注。哈，哈！」</p>
<p>「新聞記者還可以訪問你的太太呢。」老陳在笑。</p>
<p>「那時還可以躱起來，避免麻煩，不肯見面。」我也在笑。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c218">從法治轉向武治的日本 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>日本的政治舞臺，本來就是武人角逐的鬭獸塲。明治維新以前，在專政的所謂幕府將軍，所謂攝政關白，那一箇不是兇暴的軍閥？二千五百年來，除了神功皇后，聖德太子等幾個傑出的人才，利用了皇位，稍有建白以外，日本人每在舉以誇世的萬世一系的皇族，在政治上何嘗有過一點威力？一世紀前，黑船驟至，紅毛碧眼兒的鐵砲，驚破了矮人們的迷夢，於是乎尊皇攘夷，大政奉還的統一局面，方始成功了。</p>
<p>維新以後，愚昧的軍閥，脅於全國的潮流，迫於世界的趨勢，又受了堅忍的文治派的啓發，不敢再爲戎首，來破壞這箇曾經過不少的流血和犧牲，慘澹經營，艱難造就的憲政。七十年間，這蕞爾的島國，所以能夠稱覇於東洋，逞兇於世界者，都是法治精神之所賜也。</p>
<p>到了現在，議會政治也疲弊了，由貧富的懸絶而來的不安也擴大了，又加以世界新潮流的激刺，與政治中樞人物的無能，藏牙隱風，久思蠢動的武人們，自然要乘此良機，起來纂奪政治了啦。暗殺的橫行，國本社的活動，共產黨的檢舉，南滿州的出兵，那一件不是武人纂奪政治的證據？日本是在十字路上了，是在將從法治轉向武治去的前夜了，這不但我們旁觀者看得很清，就是日本本國的老政治家尾崎行雄，也在倫敦聲明過武人的將行專政，日本國運的將次告終。　　我雖不是預言家，但我相信日本在五年之内一定會起絶大的變動。先是軍閥的橫行，法律秩序的全滅，後來就是被壓迫的大衆的奮起，日本國體政體的改造。我們且等着罷！血樣的紅光，定會從這日出之國裏照射到全世界來！</p>
<h3 id="c219">她們的悲哀 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇</p>
<p>中國有一句不知什麽人說出的妙話，呌做「才子配佳人；」把牠譯成現代話便是「都看透兒配摩登姑娘」；或者就意譯作「俊哥兒俏姐兒配對兒，」也差不多。</p>
<p>這「才子配佳人」的例，我們可以隨便舉出很多來，西方的，但丁和裴脫麗思，基茨和芳納，羅散底和西達兒，雪萊和瑪麗，高爾治華斯和開德；東方的，白樂天和樊素，小蠻，姜白石和小紅，王獻之和桃葉，韓翊和章臺柳，······</p>
<p>眞如密爾頓所說，「男子是神勇的化生，而女子却是溫柔嫵媚所造成。」歷來的浪漫史中，幾乎可以說男子是賣俊，賣他的才能，女子是賣俏，賣她的顏色；男子儘可醜一些，而女子却不可没有一張鵝蛋臉；男子能俊而又俏那是錦上添花，可是女子有才能却成爲畫蛇添足了，那些老奸巨滑的道學家不是高唱「女子無才便是德」的高調麽？</p>
<p>在過去，有才能的女子，幾乎完全是在悲哀中度生活的　這不是命運，乃是社會上壓迫和輕視的結果。美麗的雷加答兒夫人有星一般的男子圍繞着她。著名的莎菲柯華列夫斯基敎授却自嘆着；「爲什麽没有人愛我呢？我超于大多數的女子；可是最庸凡的女子有人愛，而我却没有」！這些多才的不幸者，我們到處可以聽到她們的嘆息。</p>
<p>翻開中國的文學史，著名的女作家，没有不是在悲哀中度日的，她們的作品，就是她們的非哀的結晶，我們狠熟的女詩人朱淑貞，她的詩集就題名「斷腸集」，而且還發出「女子弄文誠可罪，那堪咏月更吟風」的憤語，這正是東方的不幸的「才女」的典型。</p>
<p>偉大的女詞人李清照，她的一生就是一首哀情的詩，我們讀她的名作「聲聲慢」，那種「說不盡，理還亂的」愁思，藏在她心頭的無限的悲哀，都憑着她的天才留在紙上了。</p>
<p>清初的女詩人賀雙卿也是個「以悲哀　生命的泉源」的女子，她寄給她的舅父的蘆葉上寫着；「憶夜無歡，向春難笑，桃紅遽大，竹翠長負，豈不期人歌泣哉！」這種情景，眞是「誠不能不怨」了。</p>
<p>在西方，英國的女詩人勃朗寗夫人，當她還在少女時代，把自己的心理寫在她的小說中，借着書中的女詩人的口說，「呀！天呀！一個女子當冬夜獨坐在家裏而遠遠地聽着全國的頌讚聲，這種悲哀，只你能知道，没有一個吻兒在我們的唇上，我們的眼睛老是濕着，爲了無人顧問我們流淚的原故」。若没有大詩人勃朗寗接受她的愛，那末她恐怕不但作那名詩「孩子們的哭聲，」也許還要作一首「少女們的哭聲」呢！</p>
<p>德國的女詩人阿德兒叔本華是哲學家叔本華的妹妹，在她的日記裏面曾很驕傲的寫着自己的悲哀：「有誰比我可愛呢？在戀愛中，有誰能比我找到更大的幸福？但這是完了，永遠的完了！我只好留在我的孤獨的墓中，」這種悲哀的人生，養成了她的「高傲和孤獨。」</p>
<p>其他，俄國的女作家柯崙泰，在她的偉著「赤戀」中寫着革命女子戀愛時的悲哀，這書中的女主角恐怕就是少女時代的柯崙泰罷。法國斯達埃夫人也怨嘆着才名帶給她以不幸的命運。</p>
<p>自然，在這「才子配佳人」的圈外，我們終還可以找得像「秦少遊和蘇小妹」一樣的對兒。並且在這新時代中，我們更能多找得一些，美國的女詩人米萊不是正過着她的愛的生活麽。這梭姑娘便是個好例。</p>
<p>時代是不息地在轉動着，我們深信那「俊哥兒俏姐兒」的時代一定要過去，而那未來的「偉男子健女子」的時代必然要到來。這新時代的引進，定可使她們的悲哀有消滅的一天。</p>

<p>— 洪興熾</p>
<p>德國飛機勤克斯第三十八號，是最近世界第一大飛機，現在已製造完竣，開始在伯林和倫敦中間飛行了。</p>
<p>這架飛機是專用來載客的，中間二個大艙，機尾一間吸烟室，因爲靠近馬達吸烟，要引起危險的。機翅下面還有一間可坐兩個人的小艙專爲喜歡看景緻的乘客設立的，票價當然要大些。全部可以乘坐三十四個搭客，連同一個掌舵，一個副掌舵，一個工程師，兩個機師，一個無綫電收發員，一個管事共總可載四十一個人。</p>
<p>全機共有四付每付六百五十匹馬力的馬達，左右二翅裏邊各藏兩付，四個安置燃料的槽也是左右各二，引擎間像大輪船一般，保護極周密。這架機在海面上飛行時，每小時速力一百十五哩，陸地上五十八哩。機身下邊更裝有兩對大輪子，在地面上也可以駕馳行走，因爲機身太大了，推不動的。載滿了搭客之後，共有三十一噸重量。機翅比機身短，所以飛在空中，好像一只短翼鷹一樣。</p>

<p>他聽清楚了他們所唱的歌中的意義了。因爲前星期五，曹世光帶他到敎會裏去時，聽見過他們唱這首讚美歌。</p>
<p>「啊呀！那不是哈巴牧師麽」？</p>
<p>他看見哈巴牧師揮動他的右手，在指揮他的部下唱歌，左手却拿着一方白手巾揩額上的汗水。他的上下唇一張一闔，他的歌聲也特别雄壯，和牛鳴一樣的宏高。</p>
<p>鶴子夫人像身材矮小了一點，此刻她蹬起她的雙足，雙手搭在他的雙肩上，把下頤靠着他的肩頭，望那些傳道的人們。她的右頰幾乎貼近他的左頰了。他也感着了她的呼吸，近似ＡcetyleneGas的氣味。他在這時候，生理上和精神上感着一種重大的壓力。他也覺得全身的血液有些沸騰起來了。</p>
<p>他再留心一看，在哈巴牧師的指揮之下，曹世光和廖海峯兩個也都在那裏伸長頸項唱着讚美歌。看他倆的精神，是十分的疲勞，但也不能不拚命地和着他們唱。他又看見了曹世光在　呵欠。</p>
<p>「啊呀，他們眞熱心傳道呀。」</p>
<p>她笑着對他說。他又聞着一陣近似AcetylenlGas的氣味了。他覺得這種氣息是具有興奮　，刺激性的。</p>
<p>「　　哈，哈。　個人在打呵欠！」</p>

<p>— 愚</p>
<p>我們中華民族彷彿是個奄奄一息的病人，而日本則像一個替人治病的醫生。病人病到十分厲害，總是精神萎靡，開口覺得懶惰，甚至目瞑若死，聲嗅俱無，醫生輒在這個當兒，給它打上一針嗎啡，使它這不絶如縷的神經，得到藥力而有發生興奮的可能，現在日本之於中華民族，亦是如此。</p>
<p>前年「九一八」瀋陽之變，是它驟然地給我打上一針！去歲「一二八」淞滬之變，夾上又來一針！最近二十二年一月三日的「榆關之變」，又給我打了一針！　　本來我中華民國的民族性，可說是老早瀕於銷沉！拿病態來譬喻，簡直到了氣息僅屬，無藥可救的地步，忽地被人打了一針嗎啡，把昏迷的神智，清醒過來，頓時覺到大禍臨頭，危在旦夕！才思力圖掙扎，而喊出一種凄厲而復沉痛，「抗日救國」的悲聲。正在乘着一團高興，喊得起勁的時候，接連又是一針！於是這連續不斷的藥力，更從四肢百骸而充滿全身，全部神經，益臻興奮而莫可遏制！因是索性放直喉嚨，大喊特喊！可是歷日稍久，藥力漸退，喊聲漸低，終且力弱聲微，仍將歸於沉寂之境。這位東鄰的日本，瞧見我們民族依然有氣無力，快要回復先前的埀斃狀態：因而煞死要好，又給打了一針！想來我們民族從茲仗着這迅捷而又猛烈的藥力，又當得到一度之興奮，很努力地呐喊起來，熱鬧的情狀，一定不减於從前，其持久程度，至少言之，當有五分鐘的延長咧！</p>
<p>不過嗎啡的性子，終有退盡之期；况且他是毒物，打得多了，就有戕賊生命的危險！所以靠了嗎啡而興奮，到底不是一回事！</p>
<p>而末後，我還要問一句：我們中華的民族，豈眞是打了嗎啡才知興奮的民族？我們的政府，豈眞是麻痺極點，打了嗎啡而還不知興奮的政府？</p>

<p>這是怎樣的一回事呀？第三總隊前天電報來，說昨天他們可以向義勇軍後援會領子彈去，領到後，立即送來，怎麽到今天還不見送來呢？難道路上遇了敵軍失了事嗎？還是没有領到？</p>
<p>我們大家焦急着，本來，我們子彈不多，爲了奪這個羅田堡，和敵人戰了三天三夜，費去的實在不少，若是第三總隊再不將子彈送來，我們不是要前功盡棄了嗎？</p>
<p>幸虧敵人不衝過來，只放幾排哨槍，我們郤伏在冷冰冰的濠溝裏，動也不動，有時他放幾下槍，但是，這不過是虚張聲勢而已，其實我們最好是不放，這時候，我們的子彈是多麽寳貴啊！敵人的鐵鳥，不時地到我們陣地來偵察擲彈，我們没有理他，我們在害怕别給他們曉得我們的子彈是没有了啊！</p>
<p>我們期望着，渴望着第三總隊的接濟早日來到，</p>
<p>可是，在下午，我們的希望變成絶望了！</p>
<p>「弟兄們！大槪你們都已聽到了，第三總隊方才有電報來說，義勇軍後援會所存子彈不多，不肯發，不肯發，我們没有子彈，將怎樣呢？」吳隊長對我們說，「我們，要死？要活？」</p>
<p>「要活！」</p>
<p>「要活！」</p>
<p>「要活！只有兩條路：一條是撤退，一條是！」吳隊長說，</p>
<p>「撤退嗎？我决不撤退！我們費了三天三夜的功夫，纔把這羅田堡奪下來，怎麽肯輕輕地將它放棄？」老程急急的說，</p>
<p>「是，我們决不放棄羅田堡！否則不是前功盡棄了嗎？」</p>
<p>「還有一條路是！」吳隊長接下去說，「是什麽？」又是老程的聲音，</p>
<p>「别嚷，聽着，那條路是！是投降，投降敵人！」</p>
<p>「甚麽？投降嗎？」又是老程，</p>
<p>「投降了大家有大官做！我們都有地位！」</p>
<p>「唔！投降敵人，且不問有没有官做，我們不是替敵人當兵，和第三總隊我們自家去打仗嗎？是伍隊副的聲音，</p>
<p>「砰！」的一聲，吳隊長倒了！</p>
<p>「弟兄們！這種賣國賊不打死尙待何時！現在他被我打死了！我說，我們用我們的最後幾排子彈，向前衝去！奪他們的子彈，好嗎？」伍隊副大聲說，</p>
<p>「好！衝出去！」我們的槍頭都上了刺刀，</p>

<p>— 動心</p>
<p>「你們簡直是奴隸！」一位國文敎員常常對着一班上上國文時好糊閙的學生這樣說，的確，他們上國文時實在是太過分了，黑板上塗不少侮辱師長的句字和圖畫，並且發出種種的怪聲，簡直不像是上課，那怪不得那位國文敎員忍不住這種向上衝的火氣。</p>
<p>那位國文敎員是一位國學深淵，忠誠盡職的敎員，他並不像别的敎員告假，遲到，早退種種的惡習慣，他講書的聲音很響亮而且清楚，他具着這幾種要素，所以成爲我們學校裏數一數二的好敎師。</p>
<p>「······」上課鐘正在響着，他的脚步已踏進課堂，點了名之後，他開始提高他的嗓子，想引起同學們對於國文課的興趣，可是同學們對於國文課的散漫，好像是遺傳性似的，無論是那位高深研究敎育的專家，我想恐怕再也不能打破這種惡習慣，所以同學們照例的談話，打盹，看小說······</p>
<p>時光一分一分鐘的過去，同學們談話的聲音也隨着一時較一時的高了，那位敎員實在忍不下去，便放了書本，用甘言密語來勸導，但是結果不但等於對牛彈琴，而且還博得嘘嘘的反抗聲。</p>
<p>「如果你們有不願意上課的，請你們出去·····你們不想想你們的爹媽拿血汗換來的金錢來給你們讀書，想你們將來成就有爲的人·····如果你們不願意讀書的話，那末請你們的家長，將你們的學費捐給東北義勇軍去殺敵，免得······　　好寳貝華北給了我吧！</p>
<p>」那位敎員逾講逾氣、面上像火一樣的紅，因爲同學們不聽他的敎訓，而且譏笑和談話的聲音合成一片，課堂像市塲一樣。</p>
<p>「你們專在國文課糊鬧，怎麽你們不像在英文那樣的守規則呢？······你們怕外國人，看不起中國人，你們配不上講愛國，更配不上做中國將來的主人翁······你們是外國人的奴隸·····」同學們對於這位敎員太不表同情了，我常常聽說他爲了學生的糊鬧，替國家前途悲觀，甚至常常流淚痛哭。</p>
<p>下課了，那位敎員還没有講完他的話，同學們早已爭先恐後像潮水一樣地擁出去。</p>
<p>接着是英文課，課堂裏十二分的靜，連咳的聲音也没有，他們看待這位綠眼高鼻的外國人像神聖不可侵犯似的，較他們的父母還要尊敬，更不要說談話，連動也不敢一動，隨着是照樣的下課，可是情形是兩樣，同學們像没有聽到上課似的。</p>
<p>“Nexttimepreparetwentypages·DoyouallUnderstandl”那位外國敎員站起來接着這樣說，“Yes，sir”同學們齊聲的回答，然後一個一個，像軍隊行伍排列一樣地隨着那位外國敎員走出課堂，我不覺回憶國文敎員說的「奴隸」一點鐘的功夫已實現在我們的眼前了。</p>

<p>他雖老，他的一顆心，還是和少年時一樣，熱的不得了。尤其是對於國事，留意得比什麽厲害。他看了外國侵略本國的舉動，時常憤然作色，不能自己。</p>
<p>一天，他知道本國着外交决裂，和某國正式宣戰。於是他喜極了，對他的四個兒子道：「我們的國家，被某國種種侵略，已是忍無可忍了。現在他們又借端槍殺我們的許多同胞，違背國際公約，引起全世界的公憤。而他們的外交當局，靠着本國海陸軍的武力爲後盾，更一點不講公理。以致交涉决裂出於戰爭。這一次的戰事，關係我國的存亡，我是老了，不能再到彊塲上爲國效力。你們幾個人，都是年富力强，正好替國家出力，爭回主權；不知誰願意去從軍？」······他這話還没有說完，四個兒子，早都熱烈的呼道：「我願去！我願去！」他不覺掀髯笑道：「好勇敢青年！」</p>
<p>他送了他的兒子去後，没有一天不打聽戰爭的消息。一星期後，恰却有個朋友從戰地上來，告訴他說：「打了勝仗了！但是，你的一個兒子死了。」他聽了，微笑着道：「這是很好的事情！」再隔幾天，又有人對他說；「又扛了勝仗了！但是，你又一個兒子也死了。」他依然快活的說：「很好的事情！」後來，他的其餘兩個兒子也繼續戰死了。這樣，他的四個兒子都死了。同時，某國已停戰求和，自願取消以前所訂的不平等條約，送回以前侵佔的土地。他聽到四個兒子没有一個生還的，固然不免滴下幾點老淚；但是，知道戰爭的結果，是靠着全國壯丁的努力而勝利，又不覺手舞足蹈起來。在大軍整隊遊行的一天，他老人家也揚着光明燦爛隨風飛舞的可敬可愛底中華民國國旗，勉提着枯澀乾燥的嗓子，在萬人歡呼聲聞十里一片喧閙中附和着高唱那揚我國威雪我國恥打倒帝國主義取消不平等條約的爭自由爭平等爭獨立底凱旋之歌。</p>

<p>編者先生：翻開報紙，時常有「勢利的櫃員」「傲慢的櫃員」等文字，映入我們眼簾；從來没有看見「蠻橫無理的顧客一類的稿件。編輯先生未免有「偏袒」的嫌疑，這或許被所謂「天下無不是的顧客」一句話所淆惑罷？</p>
<p>我是在上海稍負名望的國貸商店當個售貨員的職務，差不多混了三個年頭。耳所聞，目所見，親身經歷過櫃員與顧客發生糾葛的事情。把糾葛的起因來分晣一下，售貨員固然有招待欠週的地方，顧客也未始没有「壞脾氣」的弊病。　　差不多十之五六的西其裝，革其履，所謂智識階級的顧客。在賜顧的當兒，他們彷彿聲帶發生了障礙似的：口裏「嘘嘘」的吹着，同時用一隻食指指點某種所需要的貨品，老不願「一開尊口。」如果誠懇地拿了他所需要的貨品而問他要買多少的時候，他老是伸出指頭的多寡表示所需要的數目。</p>
<p>我眞不懂，這種西裝朋友，他們是不是以爲自己是至高無上的人物，對於做做生意的人，不情願和他交談呢？還是因爲售貨員不曾先爭招待，所以「嘘嘘」的吹呢？於此我們要聲明我們是任人參觀的商店，决不能像舊式商店裏的店員，做尾隨，着顧客的夠當。</p>
<p>我們商店的營業，非常發達，顧客時常擁擠得水洩不通；所以每個售貨員要招待許多買客，當然有應接不暇的地方。對於招待方面，爲着事實的驅使，不免顧此失彼；因此引起不能諒解别人的顧客的誤會，說出使人難堪的言語。「你們太勢利，不要以爲我買不多的貨品，待慢人家，要曉得買多買少，同樣是你們的顧主······。」眞的，詞嚴理正，假使有這種勢利眼光的人聽了，應該如何的眞摰地接受他們美意的勸導，但是我們何嘗有這不良的思想呀！我們的店規，「功過賞罰」不是以生意多寡做標準，完全没有像别的商店有什麽「厘頭」的陋習</p>
<p>本來處於這種情形之下，我們要說明不得已的苦衷，請顧客原諒；但是繁忙的營業，委實没有問他們解釋的可能。編者先生請你能許我借重貴刋寳貴的篇幅，解釋一下罷！王雁秋謹上。</p>
<p>編者按；王君來信所述的那種雇客，當然是犯了「壞脾氣」的毛病；同時據我們所知道，雇客的蠻橫無理，是層出不窮的。王君久嘗此味，不平則鳴，是當然的趨勢。</p>
<p>我們須知，商店是將本求利，店員是出賣勞力。在分工合作的觀念上着想，他們與被現時代認爲高貴的任何一階級，同爲社會上不可缺少的分子，能夠澈底了解這意思，那末爲雇客者，當然不致有傲慢的舉動了。</p>
<p>末了我們還得勸勸王君，以後遇到這種雇客，能夠有機會解釋解釋，當然最好。否則亦不必介介於懷，因爲這是他們自隨人格，犯不着與他們一般見識。</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>夏太太旣拒絶仲南收容外室母子於前，何以現在又恩准他娶一個妓女做姨太太呢？原來仲南初次想納妾的時候，就以「不孝有三，無後爲大」等聖諭去感化她，她就說：「只要大家努力，我非不毛之地，下了種總會結果的，如果過了四十歲，還是這樣不爭氣，那只好由你去自由行動吧！」</p>
<p>那位夏艾若華女士就是在夏太太舉行過四十大慶的盛典以後，才正式嫁給夏仲南老爺的，若華二字究竟是不是她懸牌應徵的芳名，因遠在天南，現已無從查考；我們祗知她嫁過來的時候，還帶了一個贅疣式的油瓶姑娘到夏家來。</p>
<p>若華年紀並不大丨那時只有二十七歲丨而她已曾飽經憂患，在情塲中翻了一個大觔斗來的，據她對仲南說：</p>
<p>「我本是好人家的兒女，父親在張家口一帶做馬販子的，因爲路上遇見了鬍匪，將一羣馬全被搶去，他喪失了資本回家，氣成瘋癱之症；不久就與我母相繼病亡，我在十歲時就淪落娼門了，十五歲時在江南懸牌出堂唱，那時我已很懂得人事，知道做妓女是下賤的事，一心要想從良，直到十七歲，才被我物色到一個少年，我見他長得一表人才，尙無妻子，只是家裏窮些罷了，我心裏只想一夫一妻，辛苦度日，但能獲得精神上的舒服就夠了，我立意要嫁他，把我的私蓄供給他去讀書，過了幾年，我在别的客人身上刮到了一票錢，敎他出面替我贖身，我便實行嫁給他了。同居一年，就生了一個女兒，而那人的劣跡也漸漸的發現。原來他在家鄕早已娶過妻子，拿了我的錢去，瞞住我在外面嫖賭。常常問我勒索錢物，若不給他，開口就駡，動手就打。後來他見我的錢用光了，便棄我而去，我没有法子，只得重墮風塵，不遠千里，到這個地方來謀生活。這都是爲了這女兒才出來受苦，若没有她，我早已不願在人世了！第一次嫁人，我上了少年人的當，以後再不敢輕於嘗試，所以我情願嫁給你這老頭兒做偏房。不過我的女兒！我爲她吃盡千辛萬苦！是永遠要帶在身傍的。我過門之後，寗可你待虧我，都不能待虧她。</p>

<p>— 抱寒</p>
<p>對於「佳土」的期望</p>
<p>美國影片中涉及我們中國人的，如「不怕死」，「上海快車」都已宣佈了死刑。此外名目繁多不勝備述。但就所知者而言，「閻將軍的苦茶」（ＢitterＴaeofＧoneralＹen）在故事上而言，並無僇辱我們中國之處，不過在服飾上，化裝上，以及描摩我們中國人的舉動上，總有可挑剔的地方，倘使在上海放映，難免爲Ｆastidious影評家所抨擊。</p>
<p>「男女子」（ＳonDaughter），内容本事尙未研究過，不敢加以評論，但雷門諾伐羅係好萊塢地方很看得起中國人的人。他歡喜同中國來往。他說中國人誠實，同他們來往是有福氣的。所以我想雷門主演這張片子，不至於挖苦我們吧。况且雷門爲主演此片，竟剃了一個光頭，戴上一頂方頂西瓜皮帽子，我們在幽默生思上，似乎不應當過於苛求吧。卽就魯意史東拖髮辮而論，我們二十多年以前，不是人人拖一條辮子，加上絲縧，自命翩翩的公子？我看魯意史東扮演得眞不錯，不過我在未看本事以前，還要保留一個判決。</p>
<p>「傅滿洲的面具」（ＴheＭaskofFuManchu）内容外觀，可以說俱臻惡劣之上乘。本事旣荒謬，扮演復不倫？我可以斷定這張片子，是專爲美國人缺少世界知識的人看的。米高美公司爲什麽要這樣作法，眞是莫名其妙，但可以使我們對於他們知識的囿限，加以進一層的認識。（本事日後當略爲介紹一些）。但我們亦不能深怪他們，因爲美國人民完全是一種享樂的人民。他們雖好游歷，但不過游山玩水作爲享樂之一端，並不是眞正來費心考察人情風俗的。他們所知道中國人的一切，不過紐約舊金山等處的唐人街。他們從來没有和高尙的中國人士接觸過，所認識的幾個中國或祇是洗衣舖或雜碎館裏的低級人。這種人大抵不識體統不顧國家顏面的。</p>
<p>現在有一位在中國多年的人，她著了一部關乎中國農民生活的小說，這本書是美國出品中一九三二年（？）最佳之傑作，曾得當年的普列則獎金。她的書曾編爲舞臺劇，在紐約風行一時。這位著作家就是布克夫人，（ＭrsPaerlBuck）她的丈夫露辛布克（ＪＬossingBuck）係南京金陵大學農村經濟社會科學主任敎授。布克夫人生長在華，所知獨多。她著的書名「佳士」（ＧoodEauth）。作者於碌碌終日之餘，尙未能竟讀，但覺得頭幾頁描寫北方鄉村間的生活係迫眞而深刻的（她描寫北方大宅門兒的管家大胖子，臉上一粒痣，留了三二根長毛不剃去，就見得作者劃的一斑了）。這本書於舞臺成功之後，米高美又要將他編成電影（布克夫人所說的ＥlectrfeShadows）聽說已在籌備排演之中；我不能不表示一種深切的期望。至於以後的究竟，還是留待將來慢慢地宣布吧。</p>

<p>情節可以說這片子是和一本長篇童話小說一樣，而且也不平板，處處把兒童們「活潑潑地」表露無遺。這種片子，是換了一切人的口味，而且這一種滋味是已往所未曾嘗到的。</p>
<p>我並不是說這片子是怎樣的好一一可驚｜｜但是我感到即使是十年前的賈克柯根，或現在的賈克柯柏所給我們的，也不能和這一張片子同日而語。原因就是因爲已往所謂的神童演員，一個人充了一片的主角，配角少不得用成人來陪托：而這次的「神猫艶話」竟是多數的兒童合力攝成的。當然這片子的導演，也可以算煞費苦心了。</p>
<p>在攝影或光線佈景上没有什麽可指之疵，配的音樂却眞神妙。牠能把冷落的片段，尋得緊凑生動。</p>
<p>小明星們不但表演極好，而且對白的精神說句土話簡直是「小大人」。唱的歌，跳的舞，也可看有趣。我深切的相信，這片子是小孩子們最歡迎的。可惜卡爾登這張片子，只有兩個日塲（夜塲是意大利舞台劇）。喜歡孩子的成人或是希望自己子女活潑的父母都可以在這片子中找到相當的快慰。</p>

<h3 id="c234">談「人道之」賊 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>在一個冷雨橫飛的冬夜，明星公司的新片「人道之賊」在中央悄悄地試映了。雖然是不公開的試映，我得到了消息，却趕緊跑去賞了「先睹爲快」的光。</p>
<p>試完片從中央出來，在路上，我在腦幕上把看過的影片從新映演一遍，覺得印象實在不壞。如今寫一點我的意見在這裏：</p>
<p>㈠談導演　該片的導演者是王獻齋。憑着他的天才，「人道之賊」中便很多聰明細巧的流露。尤其是幾個穿挿，可說是異常的雋永有味。例如片中莊大德和兒子看書的對照，父子倆的梯邊邂逅等，都微妙可喜。幾幕莊志卿調情的戲倣得很新鮮。嚴格的說，本片的導演技巧，在「深刻」方面是　　一些，但還活潑生動，</p>
<p>㈡說表情　鄭小秋身份適合，所以做得狠好。其次徐莘園，這位先生，面目確是有些「道貌岸然」，但一種刁滑的氣象却隱隱地看得出來。說到女角，那麽朱秋痕比嚴月閒要稱職些。</p>
<p>㈢論意職　這一部片子，在意識上，暴露社會黑暗面是十分有力的。它把一個僞道學者的「仁義道德」的紙面具，勇敢地將他戮穿，將他撕碎，明白地替我們指了出來，究竟誰是「人道」的「賊」？誰是社會的敗類？丨這樣的暴露在現在自然是需要的。</p>
<p>總之一句：這是値得一看的一張國產影片，所以我願意將它介紹於諸君之前。</p>
<h3 id="c235">美人名馬｜新光 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 靄</p>
<p>派拉蒙的WildHorseMesa，新光銀幕上放映了。這片子和中國武俠片差不多，不過劇情還可看。牠所描寫的，雖然没有跳出美西生活影片的範圍，然而與其他牧人生活片，有顯然的分别。</p>
<p>牠劇旨裏的道德觀念很豐富。第一牠顯示善惡的報應，絲毫不爽。第二能演出上天有好生之德，雖死一無辜的動物（馬）也是不人道。第三是說：男女之情手足之義並爲人倫之正道。</p>
<p>表演上非常緊凑。劇中人都能夠現實化，特别是演武俠著名的蘭道夫司高特RandolphSeott他的一匹馬「彭赤」Bench也眞不錯。湯尼（湯密克司的馬）受了傷，不能爲銀幕工作了，以後「馬明星」的名位大約「彭赤」很有望吧。</p>
<p>攝影平常。光線是多屬外景，談不到什麽藝術。導演可以，對白也還有傳神之處。穿挿很適宜。唯爲佈景似乎露假了一點，但是眞景亦很多。大羣的野馬，偉大的曠野，在别的片子中，是不常見的。</p>
<p>「美人名馬」四個字，猛一看，一定以爲這是愛情片。而實際上愛情的事，在片子裏，佔了極少的成數。而「崇拜英雄」主義却在這裏無形的潛伏着。</p>

<p>踏進了正廳的門，喧囂的聲音，使我感到有些不耐，再看看屋子裏，黑壓壓地坐了一院子的人。我攢着眉頭，好像要發現新大陸一樣地在搜求着空位。</p>
<p>可巧，我忽然在人羣中間，發現了一個空位我立刻謝了一謝坐在旁邊的人，側着身體擠了進去。</p>
<p>當我狠高興的預備坐下去的時候，坐在旁邊的一位年青而摩豋的太太，忽然地攔着說：「呀！這裏有了人呢」</p>
<p>我怏怏地又擠了出來。</p>
<p>第二次我發現了空位，也遭了同樣的拒絶，第三次···第四次也遇着同樣的回答。我也有些火起來，預備退票子不看了。</p>
<p>當我回頭的時候，無意間看見那位太太的旁邊，依舊空着一個位置。我的好奇心衝動起來我於是就站在旁邊等着。···</p>
<p>五分鐘過去了，電影也要開幕了，那位太太也同樣的拒絶了好幾個人，位置確依舊在空着，我於是大胆地再走了進去。</p>
<p>當那位太太才要發言的時候，我阻止了她說：</p>
<p>「對不起得狠，等這位置上人來的時候，我再讓他好了」。</p>
<p>這位太太不再說什麽！確狠狠地瞪了我一眼。</p>
<p>等到影幕上的TheEnd顯了出來，這位年青的太太站起來的時候，我依舊没有變更我的位置，我重新看看這位太太，她正要安閒地向外走去。</p>

<p>㈢大會之舞（龍翔鳳舞）</p>
<p>又是一張維也納的片子，烏發藝術之宮的力作，極富於音，光，與色彩的美，史的回憶與童話式的幻想，隨着音樂的伴奏非常迷人地展開。表演熟練，穿挿生動，尤其餘事。　　史的背景是一八一四年，正當法蘭西的革命怒潮被暴力壓倒以後，全歐洲的專制魔王又一度出現於光天化日下的刹那之間，當時那位法蘭西大革命畸形發展出來的寵兒｜拿破崙波拿巴特，已被幽囚在地中海的孤島之上，他那橫行歐羅巴的宗敎式的大軍隊，不是埋没在俄羅斯的冰河之下，便是染紅了薩克遜的荒野，總之，就是法蘭西自由平等的吼聲，已無力再給專制魔王們以深夜的威嚇。因此、號稱爲神聖羅馬帝都的維也納，遂歌舞昇平，萬國來朝，極一時之盛。這故事的展開，就在此盛極一時的維也納大會前後，而以麗琳哈佛所扮演的「星德勒拉」式的手套店小女郎爲中心人物，柔和地展開一段童話式的羅曼斯。然而，正當這位小女郎，饑渴地夢愛着她那「嬌媚王子」丨丨沙皇亞力山大第一的時候，地中海狂瀾陡起，拿破崙已高抬掃蕩的脚步，隨着馬賽歌籲狂的旋律重踐歐土。於是維也納大會遂悄悄閉幕，要人風流雲散，各返故土，整師奔殺滑鐵盧之疆塲，而這故事的結尾，便這樣童話式的幻滅。那手套店的小女郎（由天才的麗琳哈佛扮演），雖然流了幾滴夢醒後的清淚，却不久又恢復爲一澈底的維也納小女人，愛嬌，玩皮，狂笑與清歌······</p>
<p>故事的經過是如此，音樂的伴奏得到了很大的成功，光線是春天的明麗，處處給人以陽光下的溫和之感，導演極其聰明，演員盡有天才的程度，看了後不覺對於膚淺的美國片發生惡感。</p>

<p>Begins drafting a report according to Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant</p>
<p>The content is divided into three sections and will make as much use as possible of the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Nominated nine countries including Britain, France, Germany, and Italy as members, with Germany as chairman</p>
<p>Ireland was not included, and the Italian representative's attitude was ambiguous and strange</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen met this morning for two hours and decided to nominate nine members to draft the report. This drafting committee will be composed of one representative each from Germany, Switzerland, Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, and Spain, with the German representative as chairman. The discussion of the Special Committee of Nineteen this morning was very intense, focusing on the issue of drafting a report on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The first part of this report will discuss the historical origins of this dispute. The members had quite different views on how to write this section. The British representative suggested that the Lytton Report had already fully discussed this level and should be adopted. Starting from scratch would only waste time. However, after a long discussion, the members decided to nominate nine people to form the aforementioned subcommittee to gather opinions from all parties, knowing that it would be impossible to immediately reach a decision on the draft. It is expected that the nine-member subcommittee will take at least a week to prepare its report. Currently, only the historical part is being handled, and the Special Committee of Nineteen still needs to meet to discuss the recommendations that should be included in the second part of the report. There are several other international conferences this week, so it is difficult to decide when the next meeting of the nine-member subcommittee will be held, but it may be possible to meet after the Executive Council meeting tomorrow. Chairman Hymans of the Special Committee of Nineteen will leave here tonight but will often contact the nine drafting members by telephone and will serve as the link between the drafting committee and the special committee. The Irish representative was not included in the nine-member subcommittee, which has been criticized here, as Ireland is the chairman of the Executive Council and has been quite active in recent developments in Geneva. The Special Committee of Nineteen will probably meet again at the end of this month, at which time it will decide on the date of the League of Nations General Assembly. According to the League of Nations charter, the General Assembly must be convened as soon as possible, otherwise it must also meet in early February. Some small countries want this report to make a more detailed accusation of Japan's past actions. The Italian representative, Aloisi, clearly adopted a noncommittal attitude today. In fact, the Italian attitude has always been the same in recent developments in Geneva regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>Meeting Place Bulletin: The Special Committee of Nineteen issued the following bulletin after adjourning today:</p>
<p>The Special Committee of Nineteen has now held its first discussion to study the form that the draft report should take. This report can be submitted by the Special Committee to the League of Nations General Assembly, so that the General Assembly can fulfill its mission under Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. The Special Committee has now considered what method to use to report to the League of Nations General Assembly the failure of the Special Committee's efforts to mediate the dispute, and how to present the situation of this dispute. The Special Committee has not discussed the issue of the solution that the League of Nations General Assembly may recommend as the fairest and most appropriate. Therefore, as a result of the first discussion, the Special Committee decided to nominate a drafting committee to study the various issues raised when drafting the report. The drafting committee will report the progress of its work to the Special Committee of Nineteen. The drafting committee is composed of the chairman of the Special Committee of Nineteen (Hymans of Belgium) and the representatives of France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, and Czechoslovakia, a total of nine countries. Other members of the Special Committee of Nineteen may also submit any suggestions they wish to the drafting committee in writing. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Nineteen-Nation Committee meeting this morning, the Swedish representative Lange told reporters that most of the committee insisted that "the Lytton Report must stand on its own feet." This means that the report should include recent facts and should not only be based on what Lytton reported. Most of today's meeting was about the method of proceeding. Lange also confirmed that the draft report submitted by the League of Nations Secretariat, which is known as the "Drummond Method," although opposed by the Chinese representative as being too weak, will now be the basis for the drafting committee's work.</p>
<p>According to another source, there was a long discussion at today's meeting on whether to draft two reports. Some representatives believed that there should be one report stating the failure of efforts to mediate and explaining the reasons, and another report stating the facts and the committee's recommendations based on Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. Later, the meeting still could not resolve the dispute on this issue and handed it over to the drafting committee to decide. In addition, the committee also discussed the nature of the report, the main issue being whether to simply incorporate the original text of the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report or to re-narrate the important facts based on these eight chapters, so as to focus on the sections deemed more important. The meeting also decided to hand it over to the drafting committee to solve because the opinions were divided, and instructed the drafting committee to consider the opinions of the representatives first.</p>
<p>Furthermore, representatives from several countries, especially major countries, advocated that the drafting committee be authorized to draft the recommendations of the Nineteen-Nation Committee together, but representatives from small countries, led by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, strongly opposed it, insisting that the recommendations could not be drafted until the Nineteen-Nation Committee gave further directions in the future. After a long debate, the small countries' proposal was adopted, instructing the drafting committee to wait for the Nineteen-Nation Committee to convene again, discuss the League of Nations' judgment on the Manchurian case, and resolve this issue effectively before drafting the recommendations.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the drafting committee will begin work immediately. Hymans and the Swiss representative Motta both declined to serve as chairman, so the Nineteen-Nation Committee decided to let the drafting committee elect its own chairman. The date of the next meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee has not been decided today, but it may be on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the progress of the drafting committee. (National Electric, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Nineteen-Nation Committee met this morning, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden was very active at the meeting, and his attitude was able to fully satisfy the small countries. What is even more noteworthy is that in the recent five meetings of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, the British representative has always been the leader of the entire meeting. Among the other major countries, France seems to be less active, Germany even less, and Italy almost always remains silent. (National Electric, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft report considered by the Special Committee of Nineteen this morning was drafted by the Secretariat and is divided into three sections: 1. History, 2. Conclusion, 3. Opinions. The issue of recommendations will be left to the future, pending the guidance of the Special Committee of Nineteen. The historical part includes the League of Nations' involvement in this dispute based on the resolutions passed by the General Assembly and the Executive Council, and the events related to this dispute and the European aspect. As for the aspect related to the Far East, it is mostly taken from the Lytton Report. Although the British representative made a suggestion that adopting the original text of the Lytton Report would be more practical than starting from scratch, the members eventually agreed to write their own report.

<h3 id="e3">The League of Nations Feels Fooled by Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Resolutely Giving Up Hope of Mediation</p>
<p>The Report Will End Up Being an Empty Document</p>
<p>Of No Benefit to Us</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' attitude towards the Northeast issue has taken a sharp turn, shocking the Japanese. Since October, Japan has been dealing with the League of Nations using delaying tactics, while actively making military arrangements in Manchuria. Pro-Japanese figures such as Simon, who is a lawyer by training, can defend anyone with money and power. However, because Japan has no intention of accepting mediation, under the provisions of Article 11, Section 3 of the Covenant, he also feels helpless. The amendments recently proposed by Japan for mediation include various items that deliberately make it impossible for the League of Nations to relax. Matsuoka came here and bragged, as if the whole world were a child, not only fooling the Secretary-General, but also wanting to fool the Committee of Nineteen. Therefore, with regard to the League of Nations, in addition to rejecting the participation of the United States and Russia, and whether to relax the inquiry on the motion, at first he shirked his responsibility, saying that the Tokyo instructions had not arrived, and tried his own proposal. Then, when the attempt failed, he said that the proposal had been approved by the government. Changing his mind in the morning and evening, he lost all credibility. At this point, the League of Nations realized that it was still ineffective to seek compromise, and felt that it had been fooled by Japan. Therefore, it resolutely gave up hope of mediation and drafted a report in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. However, as for the content of the report, the major countries will still protect Japan. Does the League have the courage to declare that Japan has violated the Covenant? It is still questionable. Even if the League is able to judge right and wrong for its own interests, the report will ultimately be an empty document and of no practical benefit. Although our country can obtain legal and moral assistance from this, we are still determined to save ourselves, with the spirit of national unity, actively resisting militarily and defending ourselves economically. If this causes Japan to exert more pressure, the countries will not turn a blind eye. At this critical moment, the people of our country can only take a tough stance against Japan, so as to urge the League of Nations not to go astray again. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the situation in the League of Nations has become clear. Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke has decided to go to Britain in early February to prepare to stay in Britain for two weeks, win over Britain to restrain the United States, and bring up the old friendship of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance to Britain, demanding that Britain support Japan with some kind of agreement, and return to Japan in mid-March.

<p>After the Report Is Submitted to the General Assembly</p>
<p>Then Officially Issue a Declaration of Opposition</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held an emergency meeting of its top officials today after the Special Committee of Nineteen decided to invoke Article 15, Section 4. After the meeting, it immediately sent a telegram instructing Matsuoka to take a calm attitude for the time being, not to try to prevent it, and to officially issue a declaration of opposition based on Article 15, Section 5 after it is submitted to the General Assembly. (Far East News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry is observing the following regarding the decision of the Committee of Nineteen to apply Article 15, Section 4: If there is no new proposal, the General Assembly will of course adopt Section 4. However, the Japanese government has long been aware of this and does not feel any pain, so there is no need to urgently withdraw its representatives and withdraw from the League of Nations. However, if the League of Nations, when deciding on the recommendation案 of Section 4, 1. violates the principle that the Japanese government advocates direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and does not allow third countries to join; 1. insists on resolving the dispute based on the Lytton Report and denies the independence of "Manchukuo," then it will resolutely take the procedure of withdrawing from the League of Nations. If the League of Nations does not disregard Japan's position, Japan will be more enthusiastic in enlightening the countries to maintain world peace. It is not Japan that feels difficult to adopt Section 4, but China and the League of Nations. Therefore, China's future path is extremely worthy of attention. (Denchu News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Anticipate That the Recommendation May Not Be Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Will Return to Geneva Today</p>
<p>(Geneva) On the 22nd, Representative Matsuoka and Ambassador to London Matsudaira exchanged opinions based on various information via long-distance telephone. As a result, they learned that there is still a final chance for reconciliation efforts based on Section 3, and that the report and recommendation案 based on Section 4 may not necessarily be unfavorable. According to the observations of a third country familiar with British affairs, Britain, which has colonies all over the world and has the deepest interest in the Far East, is unwilling to see the League of Nations shrink into a European League, and knows that it is extremely painful to place Japan, the United States, and Russia outside the League of Nations. Therefore, Foreign Secretary Simon, who will return to Geneva on Wednesday, will abandon his wavering attitude and use a new method to bring the Nineteen-Nation Committee's position closer to Japan. Even if it is not successful, adopting Section 4 will definitely make the content of the report and recommendation案 moderate and prevent a breakdown. Therefore, the final decision period for the Japanese delegation is not when Section 4 is adopted, but when the British self-defense action fails. (Denchu News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow. The cabinet will meet at 3:00 p.m. today, and the Foreign Secretary will also attend to study the American invitation to Britain to negotiate war debts in March and discuss how to respond to it. Simon did not postpone his trip because of this matter. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Hérriot Believes That War Is Possible Between China and Japan</p>
<p>(Paris) Former French Prime Minister Hérriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, published an article in the Zhuo Bao today, directly attacking Japan's position in the Sino-Japanese dispute, and stated clearly that anyone without prejudice and with a conscience would believe China's account of the Yuguan incident more than Japan's. He believes that a war between China and Japan must be considered not impossible. The recent events in the Far East are only the natural development of Japan's determination to expand its sphere of influence on the Asian continent and bring China under its control. And Japan's greatest goal, or perhaps to unite the yellow race to resist the white race. It is regrettable that the white race only knows how to talk about this danger and is unwilling to take action. This serious situation is beyond the League of Nations' ability to deal with. Because the League of Nations has no American participation, the solutions it proposes or agrees on are often not perfect. In addition, Pantignac wrote an article in the Paris Echo, also adopting the same attitude. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>|Editorial of the Manchester Guardian|</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's editorial today once again commented on the Far East and Geneva situations in an impassioned tone, stating briefly that the new tension in the situation is Japan's responsibility. Japan has consistently adopted a policy of deliberate delay, which has resulted in the Committee of Nineteen realizing that Japan will never accept any basis for a solution that the Committee can tolerate. In general, politicians were initially hesitant about the Manchurian issue, showing weakness, and then changed from weakness to submission to violence. However, the big issue of right and wrong cannot escape public opinion in the end. Today, the League of Nations, whether or not it has British assistance, should begin to announce that the wrong is on Japan's side. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Membership Qualification Becomes a Serious Issue</p>
<p>||Gu Weijun Strongly Criticizes||</p>
<p>(Geneva) Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, issued a statement refuting the recent speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida. The full text of the statement was recently sent to various newspapers by the Chinese delegation. The content is as follows: "Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida recently delivered a speech to the House of Peers on diplomatic policy. However, apart from the Japanese people, anyone in the world with a little common sense will not be moved by Uchida's words. Japan's ambition is to forcibly use its own laws to govern its relations with other countries, and to say that everyone in the world will only listen to its words. This kind of mentality is clearly visible. The three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory. Japan changed them into "Manchukuo" with one hand, and then signed a treaty with it with the other hand. After it was done, Japan used its obligations under this treaty as an excuse to invade Rehe, and is thinking of putting it into its pocket. Japan is greedy and insatiable, and this is the realization of the second step of its aggressive plan. And the Japanese also ask the world to recognize it. Although Japan's entire policy on the Manchurian issue has been made clear to the world through Uchida, Uchida said that "the application of the League of Nations Covenant should be flexible." This statement is tantamount to admitting that if judged according to the League of Nations Covenant, which requires unanimous compliance by member states, Japan is currently destroying the articles of the Covenant with violence. Japan's reason for excusing itself is the so-called "China has lost its normal state." However, China's situation can indeed be called abnormal, but only in one point, that is, Japan uses strong armor and sharp weapons to invade, while China only defends itself with a weak national defense. Japan has destroyed the Covenant, but Uchida said that the application of the Covenant should be flexible. This is like a thief who breaks into a house, is caught by someone, and is brought to court. He also admits his crime, but says that the doors and windows of the stolen room were not locked, which led to the idea of ​​coveting it, and that the situation is excusable, requesting a reduced sentence. Uchida's wording is not very similar. Japan's actions in recent months, and its attack on Rehe, if Japan excuses itself with this, and people also excuse it accordingly, then there will be no other relationship between the countries of the world in the future except chaos and conflict, and the League of Nations' hope of seeking peace for the world can also be thrown into the east. Japan is the culprit of the disturbance of peace, and to say that it is the cornerstone of peace in the Far East is too contradictory. From these kinds of things, it can be seen that although Japan has been a member of the League of Nations for twelve years, it has never understood the rules of the League of Nations Covenant, or has understood them but has never been willing to abide by them. In this situation, is Japan still worthy of being a member of the League of Nations? This is a serious problem at present." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Japan's Policy Only Knows How to Benefit Itself</p>
<p>Deceiving the World About Guaranteeing Peace</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Forum Herald commented on Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida's speech in the parliament, especially focusing on Japan's claim that it is the protector of peace in the Far East, saying that Uchida's speech seems to mean that all the agreements and conventions previously signed between countries, including Japan, the purpose of which was to guarantee peace, but cannot meet the wishes of the Japanese military, and give Japan complete freedom of judgment and action in guarding the Far East, must be regarded as outdated and useless in the future. Therefore, based on Uchida's meaning, the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other agreements aimed at guaranteeing world peace must be regarded as outdated and useless in the future. The self-appointment of Japan as the police of the Far East may still need to be re-confirmed in the future. (National Electric, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Foreign Minister's speech in the Diet on January 21st has aroused unsatisfactory criticism here. The Paris Times said that although such an explanation of Japanese policy is in line with Japan's general interests, how it can be implemented and how it can be consistent with the fundamental principles of the League of Nations is still unknown. The Freedom Daily said that Japanese Foreign Minister's speech contains the meaning of amazing progress in Russian-Japanese relations, and the Far Eastern situation may undergo real and important changes as a result. Japan has now seen the unknown quantities in British policy and has turned to Russia. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Enemy Troops Attacked Our Eastern Sandao Ridge Position</p>
<p>Our Army Ambushed in the Trenches and Fought Back, Repelling the Enemy</p>
<p>No Fighting on the Shihezhai Side</p>
<p>(Beiping) At about 5:00 p.m. on the 21st, a team of Japanese troops, about 50 in number, suddenly appeared 8 li southwest of Jiaoshan, northwest of Yuguan, to scout our position. They encountered our sentry and fought fiercely, killing one enemy and the rest fled. At the same time, enemy cavalry were also found at Hujiazhuang on the east bank of the Shii River, and fought fiercely with our army for an hour. The enemy retreated to Tianzhuang, with three casualties. The enemy garrison commander Wakahe yesterday falsely claimed to the military officers of various countries stationed in Yuguan that our army opened fire when challenging the enemy position, and that the enemy would take appropriate measures to maintain safety, etc. Therefore, the situation on the front line is becoming increasingly tense. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy on the east bank of the Shii River attacked our eastern Sandao Ridge position last night, firing machine guns at our position. Our army ambushed in the trenches and waited for the enemy to approach before using machine guns and grenades to bombard them. The enemy was caught off guard and fled in panic, seizing a machine gun. The enemy then used artillery to bombard our position several times. Shimenzhai is calm. The enemy built eight artillery positions in Qinglongtan. Qinbu is severely cold, at minus 20 degrees, and the soldiers are very suffering. Many enemy troops in Yuguan have been frozen to death. The enemy sent Koreans to search for purple coal in the Yucheng area for military use, and those who resisted were brutally killed. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qindao telegram, there was no major conflict on the Shihe front line on the 23rd. Last night, more than 20 Japanese soldiers set up military telephone lines in the trenches northwest of Jiaoshan, fearing that our soldiers would shoot them, and worked in the dark. They were later discovered by our soldiers, who fired more than a dozen shots, and the enemy immediately used artillery to bombard them, firing a total of four shots. Britain intends to transfer two more ships from Yantai and Weihaiwei to protect the Kailuan wharf. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Linyu: Because of the conflict between the enemy troops in Shanhaiguan and our army scouts in Hujiazhuang yesterday, more than 20 sentries were added to Kongchengmen outside Xiluocheng today, and three field artillery pieces were moved to that location, arbitrarily searching people entering and leaving the four gates in the city. If the answer was slightly delayed, they would be detained or shot. Currently, our army's entire front line is extremely solid, and officers and soldiers are working tensely and vigorously every day. Residents in the Linyu area have been displaced due to the Japanese army's attack and the Japanese planes' bombing, and have gone to the coast and mountains to take refuge. Many have died of starvation and cold on the coast. It is urgent to find a way to provide relief to these innocent victims. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

Then a large number of Japanese troops continued to arrive and advanced towards Lingnan. The Japanese army, fearing that the Righteous Army would cut off their retreat, rushed to transfer the 49th Infantry Regiment and the 7th Field Artillery Regiment of the Japanese army, which had been dispatched to Yuguan, and arrived in Suizhong on the 21st via the pseudo-Fengshan Road. At the same time, a part was transferred to the Lingnan County border and went straight to Lingyuan. Feng Zhanhai and Li Haiqing of Kailu are still fighting fiercely with the Japanese army. The Japanese side has continuously gathered heavy troops from Tongliao to the north of Lu to reinforce. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Japanese Armored Cars Bombard Our Positions at Nanling</p>
<p>(Beiping) Geng Jizhou's troops of the volunteer army, numbering over 2,000, occupied the Qilihezi Station, seven miles south of Yixian, on the 20th. They advanced on Yixian and engaged in fierce fighting for several hours with 700 Japanese troops stationed there. Wang Futang's 13th Detachment of over 1,500 men came from Chaoyang as reinforcements. They encountered retreating Japanese troops five miles south of Yixian and, combining their forces, completely annihilated them. On the morning of the 21st, they surrounded Yixian city and destroyed more than 40 sections of the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road. Telegraph communications were completely cut off, and the Japanese reinforcements lost contact. The recovery of Yixian city is expected within days. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Delin sent a telegram to Beiping stating that he would not leave the country with a single soldier or bullet, would take refuge in the forests, and vowed to fight the brutal Japanese to the end. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese armored cars at Nanling again fired over ten rounds at our positions yesterday, all of which landed in empty areas with no losses. The volunteer army at Kailu is still engaged in mixed combat with the Japanese army. Japanese planes repeatedly flew to Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Chengde for reconnaissance. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two Japanese planes flew over Jiukou and along the Lingnan Avenue area for reconnaissance on the afternoon of the 22nd and dropped several bombs on our volunteer army near Chapeng and other places in Lingyuan. The situation in Lingyuan is tense. It is rumored that the Japanese have decided to launch a general offensive on Lingyuan within days with a division's worth of troops. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain route commander of the volunteer army stated that the Japanese army's plan to attack Rehe involves a three-pronged advance: one from Lingnan towards Lingyuan and Jianping, two from Yixian towards Fuxin and Chaoyang, and three from Tongliao towards Kailu and Linxi. In all three, the puppet troops will serve as the vanguard, with the Japanese army taking responsibility for the main force. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Commander of the Kwantung Army, Muto, in order to implement the invasion of Rehe, has ordered the Japanese troops stationed in Jilin and Heilongjiang to move towards Jinxi. By the morning of the 17th, three divisions of Japanese troops had arrived in Jinxi, joining forces with the puppet troops, totaling approximately 60,000 or more. The Japanese army's steps to attack Rehe involve first deploying the puppet troops to harass the Rehe border, and also colluding with local Chinese traitors as internal collaborators, before launching a combined general offensive. The general offensive is expected to occur after the Lunar New Year. In recent days, military movements have been very busy on the puppet Fengshan Road and the Jinzhou-Chaoyang branch line. Three thousand Japanese troops have been added to the area from Sanlihe, Yixian to Chaoyang Temple along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. The Japanese commander Hirata traveled from Jinzhou to Yixian on the 18th. Zhang Haipeng's troops are successively deploying to Suizhong, intending to probe Lingnan. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chaoyang states that Zhang Haipeng, Yu Zhishan, and Li Jichun's puppet troops in Suizhong have moved towards Lingnan, intending to probe Pingquan along the avenue from that location, flanking Chaoyang and Lingyuan from behind. The garrison in Lingnan, combined with the local militia, has taken strict precautions. Chaoyang suddenly became quiet in the south. Japanese troops are busily moving east of Nanling. Central Committee member Ji Liang is leading working personnel in Pingquan to communicate the anti-Japanese policy to military and civilian officials. Japanese planes have been flying over Lingnan for reconnaissance in recent days. The main force of our volunteer army has actively deployed to a certain location. If the Japanese invade, a full-force counterattack is assured. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Sui, dispatched by the Central Government to inspect Rehe, has now returned to Chengde. He will return to Beiping to report his mission to the Central Government after conferring with Tang Yulin. Tang Yulin's planned inspection of Chaoyang has been cancelled. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from the Rehe border stated that on the 17th, 600 Japanese infantry troops searched the area around Dawang Temple and Fenjiang Gou on the Sui-Ling border, massacred six civilians, burned down seven civilian houses, and then left for Suizhong. On the same day, early in the morning, approximately 300 Japanese cavalry, including one-third puppet Manchurian cavalry, departed from Suizhong Station. The Japanese troops rode foreign horses, and the puppet troops rode Chinese horses. There were also sixteen armored cars, each carrying over ten Japanese troops, loaded with machine guns, mortars, and four tanks. They advanced north along the Sui-Ling Road, reaching near Lishugoumen in the afternoon and camping in the villages on both the east and west sides. Wherever the Japanese cavalry arrived, they forced our villagers to hang Japanese flags to welcome them, otherwise they would be punished as volunteer soldiers. That patrol arbitrarily set fires at night, burning all the firewood and grass in the area of those two villages. The villagers suffered all kinds of abuse. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese armored cars departed for Suizhong, and the cavalry turned towards Jinzhou. Furthermore, a unit of about a hundred Japanese troops, originally with a small number of machine guns and mountain guns, engaged in battle with the residents in the area around Mingshuitangmen and Yue Temple for several days, with mutual casualties and the burning of many civilian houses. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xie Zhenguo's Sixth Detachment of Geng Jizhou's troops, numbering over 2,000, completely occupied the Yihuta and Bahuta stations on the Datong Road at 5 PM on the 20th. That evening, Wang Dequan was dispatched with a thousand troops to advance on Zhangwu. Reaching Zhanggutai Station, they engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese armored cars and enemy troops for several hours. The Japanese troops retreated, with casualties on both sides. Our side captured many prisoners. They occupied Hongchazi on the night of the 20th, planning to advance on Zhangwu. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese plan to invade Rehe has recently undergone slight changes. Because the mountain roads along the Chaoyang-Beipiao route are rugged, and the road from Suizhong to Lingyuan is also difficult to travel, an attack would entail great sacrifices. Therefore, it has been decided to defend these two locations. Recently, defensive works have been hastily built. On one hand, they are further utilizing Zhang Jinghui's rebel puppet troops to advance on Chaoyang, and Zhang Haipeng's rebel troops to advance on Lingyuan, implementing a policy of Chinese killing Chinese. Even if there are sacrifices, they are not considered regrettable. These two locations will tie down a large part of our army. The Japanese are drawing three divisions and four brigades, launching a fierce attack on our east side from the Beining line. On the other hand, they are also sending the Third Brigade's Morioka Cavalry to attack Kailu in northern Rehe, and dispatching Doihara, Itagaki, Umezu, and others to infiltrate Beiping and Tianjin, buying Chinese traitors to disrupt our rear.

<p>(Beiping) A certain military expert stated that after the Japanese occupied Yuguan, the Shihe front suddenly became silent. The reasons are: first, to observe the international situation quietly; second, seeing that our entire country, from top to bottom, has unanimously resolved to resist, they will first actively mobilize domestically to increase their invasion forces. According to investigations, the Japanese government has decided to mobilize seven to twelve divisions to participate in the war in China. Their attack plan is to first pressure our troops on the Shihe front to the Rehe area, then advance north along the Great Wall, and launch a full-scale attack on Rehe, dividing their forces from the east and Gubeikou, and simultaneously attacking Beiping and Tianjin, while launching disturbances in Beiping and Tianjin during the military operations in Shihe to disrupt our rear.

<h3 id="e21">Aviation to Save the Nation - Sui <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of saving the nation, there are indeed countless threads to untangle at the moment. It is difficult to know where to begin. However, making efforts to develop aviation can at least be considered the most practical aspect of the work of saving the nation. Modern warfare has already shifted from a flat plane to a three-dimensional one. This means that the key to determining victory in modern warfare is no longer on land or at sea, but in the air. The destructive power of aircraft is greater than that of any other combat weapon. It can turn a city into ruins in an instant and render the power of any army or navy useless. It can even determine the final victory or defeat in an instant. We only need to recall the devastation and terror inflicted upon us by the Japanese army's bombers and fighter planes during the January 28th Shanghai Incident to know that what is being said here is not an exaggeration. Not only was this the case during the January 28th Incident, but the injuries suffered by the Northeast Volunteer Army were due more to bombing from aircraft than to pressure from Japanese heavy artillery, tanks, and other powerful weapons. Therefore, at present, we can simply assert, "Without aviation, there is no national defense."</p>
<p>However, Japanese aircraft are still the most immature among the current great powers. It was only in the 20th year of the Meiji era that Chuhachi Ninomiya began to study aircraft in Japan. It was not until December of the 23rd year of the Meiji era that the first aircraft model was made, which could only fly a short distance over five rooms. It was not until the beginning of the Taisho era that there were relatively modern aircraft exercises. By the time the European War began, various European countries had already adopted aircraft as the main combat weapon, while Japan had only four, which surprisingly played a decorative role when fighting the Germans in our Qingdao. Who knew that in these ten years, they had exerted all their efforts to promote it throughout the country, and finally established the air force strength that cannot be easily underestimated today. This is of course because they fundamentally recognized the great value of the air force in national defense.</p>
<p>Now let us examine our aviation strength. It is enough to make one's heart chill and one's courage fail. Alas, on such a vast land, not to mention offensive aviation, but even defensive aviation is completely unequipped. Not only is this the case in the provinces and regions, but even the air defense of the capital is in fact no different. If the statement "Without aviation, there is no national defense" is indeed true, can we still speak of national defense? Can our future still be imagined? Although the former three northeastern provinces did have several aircraft, during the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, they were all seized by the enemy without any resistance.</p>
<p>Even now, the Japanese are still tirelessly working on the construction of aviation. They have built many underground shelters and installed anti-aircraft guns and sound detectors in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places. They have conducted two large-scale air defense drills within the past year. Even among the civilians, there is the same kind of frenzy. Many army and navy personnel voluntarily donate patriotic and nation-serving aircraft. Other national organizations or individuals are even more eager to offer domestically produced aircraft to be incorporated into the air force. As of June 19, 1932, young students had saved their candy money to purchase military aircraft, such as the "Middle School Student" and "Elementary School Student" aircraft. Other patriotic aircraft donated by civilians have reached more than 40. For the sake of aggression, they are still working so hard on aviation. For the sake of self-defense, shouldn't we rise up and catch up urgently?</p>
<p>This time, various circles in Shanghai are holding Aviation to Save the Nation Propaganda Week starting yesterday, planning to make efforts to publicize it during this week so that the people have a deep understanding of the value of aviation. We believe that this kind of work is of great significance. Indeed, "Without aviation, there is no national defense." And only the air force can deal with the enemy's air force when it devastates a certain city. Therefore, we believe that building aviation and developing aviation is the most urgent task for our country at present. We hope that in the shortest possible time, every county in the country will have at least one aircraft.</p>
<p>However, we further hope that in the future, all troops and ordnance will belong to the "nation" and not be "privately owned," because "private ownership" is not enough to benefit the country, but rather enough to bring disaster to the country. Our hope for the development of aviation is also the same.</p>

<p>Member of the Seiyukai Party Questioned in the House of Representatives Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Seiyukai Party, Ashida, questioned the diplomatic incidents with a very sharp tone in the House of Representatives this afternoon, demanding that the Foreign Minister and the Army Minister give a clear answer as to whether Japan has a definite diplomatic policy and whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs only follows the instructions of the Army. He said that Japan is currently being dragged blindly to a dangerous and dark precipice, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs being nothing more than a rubber stamp for the Ministry of the Army. Important positions in Manchuria are monopolized by the Army. Although the existence of the current cabinet is mainly for the purpose of unifying Japan's policy towards Manchuria, the general impression is that the responsibility for guiding Manchuria is now solely borne by the Army. Ashida also criticized the government with the following points: 1) Japan's unnecessarily harsh attitude in Geneva and its disputes over trivial matters; 2) Japan lacks a fundamental policy towards the League of Nations and Manchuria; 3) Although Foreign Minister Uchida has stated the importance of friendship and cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, Japan has not yet taken concrete steps to establish friendship and cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. Ashida also spoke freely about the necessity of improving Japan's relations with the United States and Russia, saying that there is a situation that makes people deeply believe that Japan's diplomatic policy is controlled by the Army, which is a shameful thing. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that there is no reason to worry about the situation between Japan, Russia, and the United States. Japan's foreign policy has always cooperated with the military authorities, but it has never handled foreign affairs according to the instructions of the Army. Army Minister Araki also replied that the military authorities are working with all parties to resolve the Manchurian problem and that the Army authorities have never acted independently in this incident. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Expansion of Armaments, the London Treaty is Equal to Waste Paper <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 1:00 PM today. Uchida Shinya (Seiyukai) immediately took the podium and said that the military expenditure in this budget proposal reached a huge amount of 800 million yen, which exposed the unreasonableness and deception at the time of the conclusion of the London Treaty (his words refer to the Minseito Party). Is this naval replenishment plan limited to one year, or will there be a second replenishment? When will the future expenses required for the Manchurian Incident be submitted? How does the current government view the decision of troop strength, which Prime Minister Hamaguchi once answered was in the hands of the government? Furthermore, he said that recently there has been an atmosphere in the military that denies party politics and capitalism, and what is the truth about this? After descending from the podium, Navy Minister Osumi immediately replied that this replenishment plan is one part of the second replenishment plan, but there is no atmosphere within the Navy that denies the party. (Editor's note: Hualianshe reported that Navy Minister Osumi answered Uchida's question in the Lower House today, saying that the Navy Province has a second naval replenishment plan, with total expenses of approximately 460 million yen, which will be a continuing project for three or four years to complete this plan. Since the London Treaty, this case has been questioned in the Diet every time, but no responsible person has given a clear answer. Osumi explicitly stated without hesitation that the current confrontation between Japan and the United States is an undeniable fact, and the detailed content will be announced at the budget general meeting.) After Prime Minister Saito and Nagai, Minister of Colonial Affairs, answered questions on the issue of supreme command, Army Minister Araki replied that the idea of denying the party is because of the individual differences, so the military department cannot answer this kind of question itself.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Army Minister Araki Leads a Minority Military to Carry Out Aggression <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Next, Ashida Hitoshi (Seiyukai) took the podium to ask questions: 1. Isn't Army Minister Araki leading a minority military to handle Manchuria? Why doesn't the whole country unanimously handle the Manchurian problem? 2. What is the policy after applying Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant? 3. What are the countermeasures against the United States and Russia? Foreign Minister Uchida answered that it is unexpected that there is no national policy on Manchuria, and the Japan-Manchuria defense alliance according to the protocol is this policy. The military department is said to be entirely in charge of Manchuria, but at the time of the incident, the nature of the incident made it impossible to determine the political aspects of "Manchukuo". Regardless of civil or military officials, the involvement of Japanese in "Manchukuo" will gradually decrease as "Manchukuo" develops.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Before the League of Nations Assembly, It is Said that There is a Reconciliation Method <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>As for the policy towards the League of Nations, there may be a method of reconciliation before the General Assembly on February 1, so it cannot be said whether to withdraw or not. For this reason, future diplomatic relations with China are a difficult problem. If the Chinese are aware and start direct negotiations, it will be easy to solve. In addition, both the United States and Russia have gradually become understanding of Japan. Army Minister Araki also replied that there is no such idea as a soldier carrying the "Manchukuo", and it is necessary for the whole country to be united. The fact that today's military department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working together is something that has not happened in 30 years. After the Foreign Minister and the Army Minister answered, Kiyose Ichiro (Kokumin Domei) questioned the necessity of renewing the administrative organization and implementing a standing committee in the parliament. Prime Minister Saito replied that the establishment of a standing committee needs to be carefully considered. After Finance Minister Takahashi answered questions about the renewal of the administrative organization, Foreign Minister Uchida said that the border issue between Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia has also been proposed by the other party and is currently under negotiation. There were also answers from Minister of Education Hatoyama and Minister of Justice Oyama.</p>

<p>Later, Matsumoto Shio (Minseito) questioned diplomatic issues. Prime Minister Saito answered that he hoped for a perfect countermeasure for the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Uchida answered that the countermeasures for Manchuria are fixed and will not change, while the countermeasures for China will be carried out in the spirit of coordination, so he is preparing for the necessary concessions, and his sincerity is well known to the Chinese side.

Mr. Duan walked, but after reaching halfway, he was persuaded by everyone to switch to a rattan sedan chair to reach the memorial hall. Duan bowed once towards the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and presented a wreath. He then entered the memorial hall to view it, and upon exiting, he walked down, supported by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Although Mr. Duan is advanced in years, his spirit is still strong. After completing the mausoleum visit, he returned to Lixingshe to rest.

<p>Regarding the Execution of Liu Yusheng, Manager of the Jiangsheng Newspaper</p>
<p>Illegally Detaining a Reporter and Refusing the Control Yuan's Investigation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Control Yuan members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin have impeached Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, regarding the execution of Liu Yusheng, manager of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, by the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters, for illegally arresting and detaining him, and for resisting the investigation by the Control Yuan. The Control Yuan has assigned Control Yuan members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Li Menggeng to review the case, who have determined that he should be disciplined. In addition to notifying the Executive Yuan, the original case documents have been submitted to the National Government for review and implementation. The original impeachment document and the review report submitted to the National Government are recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of impeaching Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, for illegally arresting and detaining Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily, and for resisting the investigation by the Control Yuan. The Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage is the fundamental law during the period of political tutelage. All government officials and citizens should abide by it in order to promote constitutional government. According to Article 8 of Chapter 2 of said law, if a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of committing a crime, the agency executing the arrest or detention must, at the latest, transfer the person to the judicial organ for questioning within 24 hours. The person or others may also request a writ of habeas corpus within 24 hours in accordance with the law. Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, detained Liu Yusheng, manager of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, at the Garrison Headquarters of the Provincial Security Department on July 26 of this year, and has not transferred him to the court for examination in accordance with the law for five months. This violates the Provisional Constitution and tramples on human rights, which is offense number one. According to Article 2 of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan, the Control Yuan may, in exercising its powers, inquire or investigate case files from various government offices and other public institutions. If there are any questions, the responsible personnel should be responsible for providing detailed answers. Furthermore, Article 1 of the Rules for the Use of Investigation Certificates clearly stipulates that investigators may use this certificate to go to various government offices and public institutions to investigate case files. The responsible personnel of the respective government offices or institutions must not refuse, and must not conceal the cases being investigated. According to the report of Ma Zhen, a staff member dispatched by this Yuan to investigate, when said staff member arrived at the provincial government to investigate the case, the Chairman not only failed to provide a full answer, but also resolutely refused to allow the review of the files, undermining the supervisory system and disregarding government orders, which is offense number two. Furthermore, the provincial government issued an order to the Provincial Public Security Bureau on July 20, stating that the Jiangsheng Daily violated Articles 19, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Publication Law regarding the stated corrections, and ordered the Director to immediately order the Jiangsheng Daily and its supplements to cease publication, and to secretly summon Liu Yusheng, the newspaper's manager, to the government for investigation. Article 23 of the Publication Law (see attachment to the investigation report) clearly stipulates that the power to prohibit publication or confiscate belongs to the Ministry of Interior. The Chairman illegally arrested and overstepped his authority, which is offense number three. Furthermore, the provincial government's letter to the provincial government stated that the Jiangsheng Daily supplement "Iron Rhinoceros" contained opinions that endangered public safety, and was handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for handling in accordance with Article 13, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for Martial Law in the Jiangsu Provincial Capital (see attachment to the investigation report). The articles cited in the provincial government's secret document to the Public Security Bureau are different, which clearly indicates a different purpose and an intention to frame him, which is offense number four. Furthermore, the novels ("When") (Underling's Know-How) (Border Sound) (Dragon Boat Festival) published in the Jiangsheng Daily supplement "Iron Rhinoceros" only describe social life, and similar articles are published in various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai from time to time. The Central Party Headquarters has not issued an order prohibiting publication, and the Ministry of Interior has no precedent of closing newspapers and arresting journalists for publishing such texts. The Chairman had no prior announcement prohibiting publication. It is already inappropriate to punish without teaching in an autocratic era, let alone today, which harms freedom of speech and undermines the spirit of the rule of law, which is offense number nine. Based on the above points, an impeachment should be filed immediately in accordance with the law. Please move to discipline Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and provide for immediate relief. Please notify the Executive Yuan and order the provincial government to swiftly transfer Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily, to the court for swift handling in accordance with the law, in order to maintain law and discipline and protect human rights. Is this appropriate? Respectfully submitted to the President for review. Control Yuan Members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin. Also, the review report, regarding the matter of the review report. The case was assigned to the two Control Yuan members, Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin, to impeach Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, for illegally detaining Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily. After a joint review, it was unanimously agreed that the Chairman of the Provincial Government had violated the Provisional Constitution and the Publication Law, detained a journalist for five or six months, and disregarded the Organic Law of the Control Yuan and the Rules for the Use of Investigation Certificates by refusing to cooperate with the Yuan's investigators. This is an extreme case of illegal and abusive power. Therefore, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, should be disciplined in accordance with the law. The Executive Yuan should be notified to order the Provincial Government to swiftly transfer Liu Yusheng to the court for interrogation in order to uphold human rights and promote the rule of law. Respectfully submitted to the President, Yu Youren. Control Yuan Members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Li Menggeng. Document submitted to the National Government, regarding the matter of submitting a request for disciplinary action. According to Control Yuan members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, illegally arrested and detained Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily, and resisted the investigation by the Yuan. A case for impeachment has been filed, which has been assigned to Control Yuan members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Li Menggeng for review. According to the report, it is believed that disciplinary action should be taken, and the Executive Yuan should be notified to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to swiftly transfer Liu Yusheng to the court, etc. In accordance with this, in addition to notifying the Executive Yuan, a copy of the original case documents has been submitted to your esteemed government for review and implementation. Respectfully submitted to the National Government. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

Under the oppression of imperialism, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, Kangzang, and other places are coveted by foreigners. If we do not take active measures, we fear that they will follow in the footsteps of the Northeast. At this time, we should pay attention to national defense and strive to consolidate the unity of various ethnic groups within the country, so that it is not too late to mend the fold.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Organizational Law of the National Political Council, a review was conducted by the Central Committee's Fifth Plenum, and Gu Mengyu, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Wu Chaoshu, Mao Zuquan, and Duan Xipeng were appointed as seven committee members. Gu Mengyu told reporters on the 23rd that the review committee had previously held discussions on the principles of the election law and proposed to combine regional and occupational elections. Because China has a vast territory and complex election procedures, it seems appropriate to first divide into regions and then use the occupational group election method in each region. The powers of the Political Council should be determined, but the final decision-making power still belongs to the Central Government. The claim that the National Political Council and the Central Political Council are the same as the British and American bicameral systems is just an analogy for ease of explanation and should not be considered completely identical.

<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently sent a telegram ordering the bandit suppression divisions to eliminate the remaining bandits by the deadline. The original order is as follows: Urgent. The deadline for eliminating the remaining bandits has been repeatedly emphasized. Each unit has ten times the strength of the bandits. Some have made efforts to clear them out, while others have been negligent, resulting in the bandits fleeing here and there, and the remaining bandits are still rampant. It is painful to say. Now the deadline has arrived. I hope that all commanders will supervise their units, strengthen their spirits, embrace the determination to eliminate the bandits completely, and make it a once-and-for-all plan. Foreign enemies are becoming more and more entrenched. We soldiers have the responsibility to defend the country. We should work harder and eliminate them quickly by the deadline to achieve complete success. Chiang Kai-shek, stationed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military organs received news from Nanjing that Chiang and Madame Song will come to the province on the 23rd and arrive on the 24th or 25th. Chiang Dingwen, Wei Lihuang, and Zhu Shaoliang will all come to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After receiving Chiang's strict telegram, each unit has been concentrating and dispatching troops at the designated time and location, extremely busy. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce and others urgently telegrammed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting him to quickly come to Jiangxi to lead the troops and achieve early suppression of the Red Army. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cai Tingkai, Director of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters, telegraphed Beijing, stating that a part of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army has concentrated in the Jianning and Taikang areas, advancing towards the Jiangxi border to cut off the bandits' retreat, and will jointly encircle and suppress Zhu Mao's Red Army with the Jiangxi army. The vanguard has now reached Lichuan. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It was reported earlier that the Red bandit military leaders Zhu Mao and others declared, at the time of the Japanese invasion of Yuguan, that they were willing to unite against Japan, on the condition that the National Army would no longer advance on the Red bandits. This news has attracted the attention of the general public, and some believe that the Red bandits have already awakened. This reporter recently visited a military expert, who said that Zhu Mao's declaration was not truly based on patriotic concepts. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to Hubei last year to supervise the suppression, the Red bandits in Hubei Province have been eliminated, and the Red bandits in Fujian Province have also been gradually wiped out by the 19th Route Army. Currently, only Jiangxi Province still has remaining bandits, stubbornly resisting, but after being surrounded by the National Army, they can be eradicated soon. Therefore, the Red bandits are now at the end of their rope, and are using the name of resisting Japan to try to prolong their lives and seek another way out. In their declaration, the condition that the National Army would no longer advance on the Red bandits is self-explanatory. Recalling that after the September 18th Incident, Zhu Mao and others also issued a similar declaration, willing to unite against Japan, but during the January 28th Incident last year, when the National Army was transferred from Jiangxi to Shanghai to reinforce, the Red bandits followed closely, harassing our advance, causing the National Army's deployment to be delayed and the rescue to be unsuccessful, and the battle of Shanghai failed as a result. Thinking about it now, there is still regret. Now that the Red bandits are desperate, they are taking advantage of the Yuguan Incident to repeat their old tricks. If the Chinese people are not forgetful, they will not be deceived by their propaganda policies, causing the great cause of bandit suppression to fail and leaving behind a major problem for the future. There will be facts to prove it soon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

The You units have been dispersed one after another, leaving only four or five hundred people. You himself died of serious injuries on the way to Kaiyang. The various routes in the northwest have also sent teams to recover, and order can be restored in a short period of time. I plan to end the military affairs and strive for a good aftermath.

The guards Li Jibo and others discovered this and went to arrest the bandit. The bandit jumped off the train. Because it was dark, the guards fired three shots, all of which missed.

<p>(Brazilian Capital) National News Agency, 22nd: The current fighting near the Nanawa fortress in the Chaco region can be regarded as the largest war in South American history. Although both Paraguayan and Bolivian capitals have successively issued contradictory war reports, the general public believes that the two countries have already entered into a major war to determine the future sovereignty of the Chaco Triangle. After three days of fierce fighting, with each side using wild artillery to bombard and engaging in physical charges, the Paraguayan Command claimed that Bolivian troops suffered more than 1,200 casualties and their morale was low. The Bolivian Command claimed that Bolivian troops were advancing steadily and that Paraguayan troops had suffered 1,000 casualties. At this time, both sides seem to have sufficient ammunition, which was transported to the front lines while the winter fighting slowed down. Bolivian operations are clearly being directed remotely by German General Kundt. In the last few hours, it has been heard that another 4,000 elite troops have been sent to the front lines, hoping to shift the situation. Both sides have strong air forces, reportedly commanded by several foreign officers. Although the battlefield is closer to the Paraguayan capital, there is no fear of air raids, as this war cannot last long due to transportation difficulties for both sides, difficulty in maintaining supplies, and continuous rain. February is the rainiest time of year, after which the roads will be muddy and transportation will become even more difficult, inevitably leading to a natural halt. However, both countries likely have no intention of accepting the proposal for an immediate ceasefire, withdrawal to original defenses, and waiting for mediation proposed by the neutral countries of the United States, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Hitler's Followers March in Various Formations</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Berlin, 22nd: This afternoon's National Socialist Party rally was relatively peaceful, as there were thousands of police and three armored vehicles on scene to suppress any disturbances. Ten thousand National Socialist Party members braved the snow and cold to gather on Burgher Street, where they formed ranks and marched toward the cemetery nearby. Party leader Hitler held an unveiling ceremony at the cemetery for a memorial building dedicated to Wessel, a party member who was killed several years ago. Hitler said in his speech that the National Socialist Party will fight until Germany's disarray, suffering, and hunger are completely eradicated.

There were many wreaths on the memorial building, and both the former German Emperor and the former Crown Prince sent wreaths. The unveiling ceremony passed peacefully without any incidents. However, before and after the meeting, there were several clashes between various parties. Communists piled bedding on top of garbage bins in the eastern end of Berlin and set them on fire to obstruct the National Socialist Party's march. The fire brigade was busy extinguishing the fires.

<p>Incorporated into Four Brigades of Puppet Army</p>
<p>Will Head to the Front Soon</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: With the intense battles between Shanhaiguan and Jiukou continuing for days, some scattered information has been gleaned from those returning from within the关，but the actual situation remains difficult to ascertain. Recently, it has been possible to hear news from the Central Broadcasting Station through radio broadcasts, but even this cannot be relied upon, as the Japanese are using the Fanyang International Radio to broadcast confusing information in order to disrupt the sound waves, making it impossible to hear the messages from the Central Station. Rumors are rampant everywhere, prices are skyrocketing, and Japanese gold notes are depreciating daily. All show signs of unrest. However, the Japanese are making every effort to beautify the peace and are creating all kinds of information favorable to Japan for the League of Nations, while not mentioning a word about the battles of Shanhaiguan and Jiukou in order to block the sight and hearing of tens of millions of people, believing that this is a surefire strategy for controlling all of the Northeast. Major cities such as Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin, along with most merchants and workers' organizations, are secretly raising military funds, intending to remit them to Beiping and Tianjin for use as war funds. The Japanese are sending out detectives to search for this. The Shandong Fellow Countrymen's Association in Harbin has already been monitored by the Japanese military police. However, many individuals are remitting funds to Shanghai for transfer to Zhu Ziqiao for use as volunteer army funds. The puppet regime's traitors know that the situation is not good, but because Japanese surveillance has been very strict recently, gatherings of more than three people are not allowed. Therefore, most people dare not talk about the Shanhaiguan incident. Merchants and workers in various places, because the Central Government has made war preparations, believe that rescue is imminent. Many are winding down their businesses and returning to关, wanting to contribute to the military effort. However, the Japanese in Dalian, fearing that the puppet regime's secrets will be leaked to the outside world, have stopped outbound ship voyages, and banned Chinese people from returning to China. Therefore, those with ambitions can only return to their original places and await the national flag to be flown again.</p>
<p>The Nakamura Brigade of the 10th Japanese Division under Hirose Jujiro is scheduled to concentrate in Harbin within the next few days and head to 关 before the lunar new year. Four brigades are to be selected from the puppet army to go south, though this has been agreed in principle, the reorganization requires further study. The Japanese fear that if the puppet army reaches the front, they will not only mutiny, but kill the enemy in reverse, so they intend to select several thousand from among their reservists and incorporate them into the puppet army. Junior officers will also be Japanese, monitoring the puppet army as they depart. The reservists will be supplemented by those currently in the Northeast. The process of organization is underway. It is not yet decided which brigades of the puppet army will be sent.</p>
<p>While the Japanese army is exerting its utmost efforts to suppress all of the Northeast by force, Hanson, the US Consul General stationed in Harbin, has departed this month on the 16th on a mission of economic investigation. The Japanese government is paying close attention to the mission of the U.S. Consul (16th).</p>

<h3 id="e87">Anti-Japanese Association Punishes Treacherous Merchants <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Wu Huangen, the owner of the Shenghe Coal Shop at Dashihui Bridge outside Xumen, specialized in selling enemy coal. In July of last year, the Anti-Japanese Association seized over 70 tons of enemy coal. At that time, due to the large quantity, it was inconvenient to transport it, so only coal samples were taken. Later, when they went to pick up the goods, the enemy coal had disappeared. In October, another 65 tons were seized, and the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Party Headquarters auctioned it off, obtaining 390 taels, all of which were used to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army. It was also decided to double the penalty, but the treacherous merchant ignored it and continued to traffic in enemy coal. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Anti-Japanese Association, based on Article 7 of the Regulations for Punishing Treacherous Merchants, sent personnel to seal up the coal shop and forced the treacherous merchant Wu Huangen into a rickshaw and paraded him through the streets as a warning to others. At noon that day, an emergency meeting was convened, ordering the treacherous merchant to sign a pledge and be photographed by the Anti-Japanese Association as a form of punishment.</p>

<p>The lawsuit involving Tan Ying and Gu Baosen was previously heard in the Suzhou Higher Court. At that time, Tan Ying's lawyer, Wang Jian, objected to Gu Baosen hiring a lawyer to appear in court. However, Gu Baosen's lawyers, Liu Zhen and Wang Peiyuan, argued that this case was a countersuit filed by the defendant Gu Baosen on the grounds of false accusation. Gu Baosen was the plaintiff in the countersuit, and according to the Criminal Procedure Law, he could appoint an agent, which was different from ordinary false accusations, which should be public prosecutions. This dispute was not resolved in court. It was then heard that Gu's lawyer, Liu Zhen, had also written a statement declaring that the appointment was indeed legal. It is now heard that the Higher Court has scheduled a continued hearing for February 2nd and has notified Gu's lawyer to appear in court. Furthermore, it is heard that the Higher Court has also investigated Tan Ying's age through the examination of her sachet, to aid in the investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Traveling Promotion Group, in order to actively promote national goods and resist Japanese goods, has specially contacted local People's Education Centers to hold a large-scale national goods exhibition. Last month, it was held successively in Xuanmiao Temple, Mudu, and Hushu Pass in Suzhou, with remarkable results. The group believes that the city of Wuxi has prosperous industry and commerce, so it plans to come to Wuxi to jointly hold a national goods exhibition with the People's Education Center. The Jiahuitang and Lanhutang areas in the park have been designated as the venue, and the official opening is scheduled for February 1st. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Both Freighters and Civilian Boats Robbed Simultaneously <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>A freighter owned by boat owner Zou Axing was previously robbed at the San岔路口 intersection in Fangmatan, suffering heavy losses. On the afternoon of the 22nd, at 6 p.m., the freighter was traveling from Wuxi to Cheng as usual when it encountered three pirate ships. Twenty or thirty bandits jumped out, dressed in tattered military uniforms, each holding box cannons, pistols, and other weapons. They boarded the ship and robbed it, firing two shots as a warning. They robbed ten yuan in paper money from Yichang Money Shop in Beitang, this county, which was being sent to Zhao Xing Pawnshop in Yangku; nine foreign dollars sent by Wang Yusheng Rice Shop to Hemaochang; three hundred yuan in cash, three light bulbs, two small champagne cigarettes, five to six thousand steel yuan, two ginseng, a silver watch, and a cotton robe, belonging to Ye Linpei and being sent to Tong Shentang. The total loss was estimated to be over 1,000 yuan. At the same time, five civilian boats were also looted, with unspecified losses. After obtaining the stolen goods, the bandits jumped back onto their original ships and sped away in a southwest direction. Yesterday, freighter owner Zou Axing submitted a loss report to the Shipping Guild, which was forwarded to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>All circles in Shanghai are preparing a grand welcome yesterday.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government designates the World College as Duan's residence.</p>
<p>Stay in Shanghai for a short period, then travel to Hangzhou for sightseeing, then go to Putuo.</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi, the former envoy to France, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to go to Tianjin to welcome Duan Qirui to the south. Qian has already arrived in Beijing with Duan the day before yesterday and took the night train back to Shanghai that evening. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Qian at the Four Banks Joint Reserve Depository yesterday and inquired about the details of Duan's trip to the south and his arrival in Shanghai. Qian kindly received the reporter and provided detailed answers as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Details of the Trip South <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to Qian, Mr. Duan Zhiquan is 69 years old and suffers from a foot ailment, making it difficult for him to move around. Therefore, he has been living in Tianjin for years, chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, and has not been involved in external affairs for a long time. This time, Chairman Chiang, considering the seriousness of the national crisis, recognized Mr. Duan as a veteran of our country who is very familiar with the situation in North China. Furthermore, Duan and Chiang have a teacher-student relationship. Therefore, Chairman Chiang urged Mr. Duan to go south to discuss national affairs together. Coincidentally, Qian was traveling to North China for matters related to the Four Banks Joint Reserve Depository. Chairman Chiang, upon hearing of this, telegraphed to Shanghai, instructing Qian to meet with him in Beijing and entrusted him with the task of welcoming Mr. Duan to the south, providing a handwritten letter to be presented to Mr. Duan. Qian arrived in Tianjin on the 19th and immediately visited Mr. Duan with Chairman Chiang's letter. Duan stated that at this time of jointly facing the national crisis, since the government has a comprehensive plan and approach to resist the enemy, people from all walks of life should unanimously support it. Although he is old, his patriotism is no less than anyone else's and he is willing to contribute his personal opinions on national salvation to the government as much as possible. Therefore, he resolutely went south on the 20th, arriving in Beijing yesterday (the day before yesterday). It was decided that today (yesterday) at 3 p.m., he would accompany Chairman Chiang to pay respects at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and take the night train to Shanghai that evening. He should arrive here tomorrow morning (this morning).</p>
<h3 id="e95">Duan's Itinerary <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Duan met with Chairman Chiang twice in Beijing yesterday (the day before yesterday), and they had a very pleasant and in-depth conversation. It was decided that he would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (this morning) to visit his eldest daughter, who is married to a Mr. Fu and resides in Shanghai. Mr. Duan plans to rest in Shanghai for a few days, then go to Hangzhou and Putuo to worship Buddha, and then go to Qingdao to visit his second daughter, who is married to a Mr. Chen and works at the Qingdao branch of the Shanghai Bank. As for Mr. Duan's visit to Shanghai, Chairman Chiang has already telegraphed Mayor Wu, asking him to provide hospitality.</p>

The central government also sent Central Committee member Zhang Yuejun to accompany Duan to Shanghai. Those arriving together include Xu Shiying, Wu Guangxin, Wei Zonghan, and his son Kaiyun, a total of five people who traveled south with Duan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Selected Residence <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Because Duan was coming to Shanghai, Chairman Chiang telegraphed Mayor Wu in advance the day before yesterday, asking him to find a residence in Shanghai and receive him. Therefore, Mayor Wu ordered Li Dachao, the section chief of the First Section, yesterday to contact the World College at 393 Fokaosen Road and arranged to borrow the college as Duan's lodging. The accompanying personnel also live there.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Welcome from All Circles <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>

The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Front is Spirited Zhang said that this time, the Japanese bandits attacked Yuguan, and the troops stationed there resisted with great spirit. Every time they heard orders, they competed to kill the enemy, showing excellent morale. Mr. Duan Zhiquan accepted Chairman Chiang's invitation to come south for discussions. This spirit of unity for the country is commendable. He also met General Wu Ziyu in Beijing, who expressed great indignation at the atrocities of neighboring Japan. He also stated that he would not leave Beijing for the time being and would never be used by others. If there was an opportunity, he would emulate Yue Wu Mu of the past and be loyal to the country. Therefore, various rumors about him from the outside world are not credible. This phenomenon is gratifying, but the people of the whole country must restore their self-confidence.</p>
<p>Glorious History Among those who have invaded our country in our history are the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties. Although our country and people have been humiliated, they still admired our culture and were eventually assimilated by us. This fact is the glory of our national history and also the essence of our historical philosophy. The people of our country often boast that our country is the paradise of the world. Although this statement is an exaggeration, it is a manifestation of self-confidence. Now the self-confidence of the people of our country is gradually disappearing, and they even belittle themselves, feeling that they are inferior to others in everything. The crisis of the country and the nation lies in this. Our nation originated in Xi'an. When I traveled to Europe ten years ago, I saw the beauty of the cultures and the greatness of the nations. I always felt that it was an exaggeration for the people of our country to regard themselves as the paradise of the world. But this time when I traveled to Xi'an, I was able to admire the culture of the birthplace of our nation and its greatness. My self-confidence was restored. Xi'an and Luoyang are in the center of the country, and transportation is very convenient. The people of our country can go there for sightseeing and discover the beauty and greatness of our culture, and their self-confidence will be restored. Then there is no need to fear foreign enemies. Even if the country is humiliated, the nation will never be destroyed and may even assimilate foreign races.</p>
<p>Developing the Northwest Since Xi'an and Luoyang are the centers of our national culture, all construction is very important. It has been decided to establish Xi'an as a city, and the construction of Luoyang is also being planned. Luoyang is now designated as a cultural center, and the establishment of a branch of the Central Military Academy is actively underway. Ordinary education in the area is very good, while higher education is waiting for a planned development. Transportation to the area is very convenient. It only takes more than 20 hours to reach Luoyang from Shanghai. After the completion of the western section of the Longhai Railway, it will only take more than 20 hours to reach Xi'an. The people in the area are strong and simple. Although the area is still in the stage of agricultural economic development, the fertile land makes the people prosperous. The main products are cotton and small-scale handicrafts. If the people of our country can invest there, their development can be expected. Zhang said that Mayor Wu suggested organizing a Northwest Association to start with investigation and research and encourage people from Shanghai to go there for development. This proposal will soon become a reality, and the people of Shanghai will also be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Saving the Country with Science Zhang also said that the way to save the country is to seek substantive construction. Wu Zhihui's proposal to save the country with motors is a response to current malpractices. Education in China is now at the point of bankruptcy, and those responsible are theorists who advocate philosophy, literature, and dreamers who advocate world unity. Twenty years ago, when I met Mr. Wu in Europe, he advocated saving the country with science, saying that if everyone could wear a worker's hat, China could become strong. Twenty years later, his advocacy has not changed, but it has not been implemented, leading to the current situation. Therefore, I admire Mr. Wu. My children are going to France this time to enter industrial schools, hoping to become workers and return to China to contribute to the construction of the country.</p>

<p>Zhu Ziqiao sent a letter to various charitable organizations in Shanghai yesterday, saying that the Kailu Chamber of Commerce and the Farmers' Association sent a telegram stating that since the September 18th Incident, the area has been plagued by continuous warfare, with people living in the open air in ruined houses, and many starving to death.

<h3 id="e102">Aviation for National Salvation Propaganda Week First Day <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Gave a Radio Speech Last Night</p>
<p>Only by Concentrating the Nation's Wisdom and Wealth Can We Build an Air Force</p>
<p>The Aviation for National Salvation Propaganda Week for all circles in this city was held for the first day yesterday. In addition to the meetings and speeches held separately by the municipal government's bureaus and departments and various groups, Mayor Wu Tiecheng also gave a radio speech at the Asia-America Radio Station at 7 p.m. The text of Wu's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Unprecedented Misfortune <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In order to commemorate the January 28th Shanghai Incident of last year, the central government specially decided to designate this month from the 23rd to the 28th as Aviation Propaganda Week. The meaning of Aviation Propaganda Week is to enable the people of the whole country to deeply understand the importance of aviation for national salvation, and the Chinese nation can also, through the awakening of the people of the whole country and the completion of the construction of the air force, obtain a new opportunity for revival and self-strengthening. Today, I am undertaking the first radio speech elected by all circles, and I also want to announce this profound and important meaning to our dear compatriots across the country. The current stage of the Chinese nation, as everyone knows, has been deeply mired in unprecedented and serious misfortune. In the emotions of the general public, it has probably been felt that the beginning of this life-or-death national struggle can no longer be shirked or avoided. In fact, China's national crisis did not begin today, nor did it originate in the Northeast. Our Premier Sun, who cares about the fate of the country and loves the nation, had already told us in his speeches on nationalism, 'The position we are in now is a matter of life and death. The Chinese nation will soon perish. Summing up the disasters suffered by our nation, one is political oppression, the second is economic oppression, and the third is the oppression of the population increase of the great powers. These three major disasters from abroad have already arrived. Our nation is in a very dangerous position. For example, in terms of the first disaster, political power can destroy a country in one morning. China is now under the oppression of the political power of the great powers and can perish at any time. Today, we do not know the life and death of tomorrow because our navies, armies, and important places do not have national defense preparations. Foreign countries can rush in at any time and destroy China at any time. What is even more dangerous is that our peace-loving nation is still indifferent under this dangerous situation, unprepared, and even because 'soldiers are fierce and wars are dangerous,' everyone does not want martial force and dislikes military affairs to the extreme. This psychology and attitude of 'living in danger and stealing peace' and 'being afraid of breaking the vase while throwing a rock at the mouse' is really the greatest weakness in the national thinking. The greatest crisis of the Chinese nation, existing in heaven and earth, must have a foundation to stand on. If a country does not have a strong foundation, the nation will lose its life guarantee. 'In ancient times, the great affairs of the country were only sacrifice and war.' Even Confucius, who advocated benevolence and influence, recognized 'sufficient food and sufficient soldiers' as the basic principle for maintaining the life of the nation. If we cannot, under the principles of democracy, attempt to 'provide sufficient food' to support our nation, and under the principles of nationalism, attempt to 'provide sufficient soldiers' to protect our nation, then we will not only violate the Premier's profound teachings, but I am afraid we will have no way to survive in today's world of extremely acute national struggle."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Catch Up <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>If we want to continue the life of the nation under such a dangerous situation, we must first get rid of the long-standing psychology of depression and aversion to martial force, thoroughly recognize the difficulties of the nation's situation, bravely stand on the front line of the national struggle, enrich the nation's courage to fight, increase the nation's strength of self-defense, and exhaust the wisdom of the whole people to study national defense, exhaust the benevolence of the whole people to build national defense, and exhaust the courage of the whole people to strengthen national defense. However, national defense construction is not a matter of one day or two, especially given the breadth of our country's territory, the length of our coastline, and our coastal fortresses, either due to treaty oppression or due to financial constraints, have never had naval defenses along the coast. At the same time, in urban areas, especially in the cities of various provinces, there is no air defense equipment. Once the country is in trouble, it will be attacked from both inside and outside and cannot be defended. Under such an urgent situation, there is really no room for us to build leisurely, but there is a need to 'urgently rise up and catch up.' Now, the national defense plan to 'catch up' is air defense. In modern military affairs, based on the experiences of the European War and several wars in our country in recent years, air defense is the most economical, most effective, easiest to implement, and quickest national defense plan. Former military strategists regarded the coast as the first line of defense. Since the power of the air force has been revealed, coastal defense has lost its role, and the air force has become the center of modern national defense plans. Since air defense is economical, effective, and important, it is even more suitable and urgent for China, which has no foundation in national defense.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Importance of Air Defense <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The air force is not only easy to organize and easy to see results, but also has the effect of preemptive strikes in military affairs, and its operational efficiency is unmatched by any navy or army. The art of war says, 'Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.' Airplanes can scout the enemy's positions, take pictures of the locations of trenches, and explore the realities of enemy camps. Its ability to destroy enemy positions and shake military morale is particularly fierce. The people of the country can reflect on the Songhu campaign for proof. Therefore, French General Foch said, 'In the future Second World War, the most active and powerful will be airplanes.' The future combat formation must be a large-scale fleet of aircraft, galloping across the sky, and their destructive capabilities will far exceed those of the navy and army, causing the enemy country's military morale to collapse and disarm. Therefore, the future air force is the main driving force for the victory or defeat of war.</p>
<h3 id="e106">National Strengths <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the European War, countries, in view of the greatness of the air force, concentrated their national strength and financial resources to engage in air construction. According to the statistics of 1929, the air force equipment of various countries has made amazing progress, especially France. France has more than 40,000 air force personnel and more than 16,000 aircraft, followed by the United States, with 6,700 aircraft, and the United Kingdom also has more than 6,000 aircraft, with an air force budget of more than 20 million pounds. Russia has more than 4,000 aircraft, Italy has more than 3,000 aircraft, and Germany and Japan have about 2,000 aircraft. Japanese students also have air force military training, and their emphasis on the air force is particularly alarming. Other small countries, such as Poland and Spain, have more than 500 aircraft, and Switzerland and Belgium also have more than 400 aircraft. Looking around the world, only our great China is lagging behind in everything. The navy and army equipment are missing, and the air force equipment is not only almost zero in quantity compared with the great powers, but also only one-third or even one-half as fast. The speed of our country's airplanes is only more than 100 kilometers per hour, while other countries have 270 kilometers. The climbing power is about 3,000 meters in ten minutes. Flying in the air to fight like this, our planes are simply for the enemy to capture.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Concentrated Construction <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Here, at this time, the people of our country should thoroughly recognize the horror of the world situation, recognize the dangers of the nation's situation, recognize the nation's urgent plan, bravely stand on the front line of the national struggle, enrich the nation's courage to fight, increase the nation's strength of self-defense, and know that air force construction is the center of modern national defense plans, air force construction is the plan to 'catch up' with national defense, air force construction is the most suitable for China, which is backward in military equipment, and air force construction is the most effective, easiest to implement, most economical, and most powerful national defense plan. Only by building an air force can we consolidate our national defense. Only by developing the air force can we save the nation from disaster. We must concentrate the wisdom of the whole country to build an air force and concentrate the wealth of the whole country to develop an air force.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Unity Can Resist Insults <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the memorial week held by the municipal government yesterday. After leading all the staff to perform the ceremony as usual, he gave a report. His words are as follows: There is an ancient saying in our country, 'Many hardships build a nation,' and also 'A country without external enemies often perishes.' Generally, a country that is full of hardships and humiliated is often able to make a tired and scattered nation alert and sensitive through stimulation, and unite through alertness and sensitivity. In the past hundred years, the oppression and threats from foreign countries have been incessant, and the people have gradually become alert and sensitive due to stimulation. Recently, the national crisis has become more urgent, and they have been able to gradually move towards unity through alertness and sensitivity. There have been many examples of this in our country, and the most gratifying thing is the arrival of Mr. Duan Zhiquan in the south. Mr. Duan created the Republic of China and maintained the country, which is admired by all. However, he has long been enjoying the tranquility of nature and has not heard of political affairs. Recently, he came to Beijing to discuss national affairs with the party and government leaders of the capital. This move is enough to set an example for the whole country, change the world's perception, and make people admire endlessly. He will be coming to Shanghai within days, and we should express our utmost respect and welcome to Mr. Duan's arrival, and we deeply believe that this sincere unity will have a great impact on the future of the country.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Speech Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the Central Martial Arts Hall, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday morning that his visit to Nanjing to see Chairman Chiang was specifically to contribute opinions and strategies on national defense. It is dangerous to resist foreign insults without solidifying national defense. The people must assist the government in carrying out solid national defense in order to achieve rapid results. If we rely solely on the government, we will inevitably be isolated and weak. Therefore, we deeply hope that the people of the country will work together with one heart to assist the government in resisting insults. The situation in North China is extremely dangerous. The only way to survive is to resist with force. There are many soldiers in North China, and we hope that the chief generals will do their best to plan everything and achieve the goal of recovering the lost territories. The art of war says, 'Who is the ruler who has the way, and who is the general who has the ability.' We deeply hope that Zhang Xueliang, the chief general of North China, will rejuvenate his spirit and insist on resistance. Feng Yuxiang is still residing in Zhangjiakou and is extremely indignant at the Japanese army's invasion. Therefore, he has repeatedly telegraphed to me to express his determination to kill the enemy. As for the rumor that General Feng is coming south, I have not heard of it.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Statement from the Postal Workers' Associations Regarding Minister Zhu's Remarks <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper report on the remarks by Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia-hua regarding the reorganization of the post office, in order to maintain the domestic postal service, he has decided to immediately undertake streamlining, and all those who previously received salaries without working will be dismissed to save money. The local postal and postal worker associations claim that this situation does not exist in the post office. They telegraphed Minister Zhu on the same day, requesting a solemn statement to protect the reputation of postal personnel. The original telegram from the two associations is recorded below: "Nanjing Ministry of Transportation, Minister Zhu Jian, In today's newspaper reports, the Minister's remarks on the reorganization of the post office include the decision to immediately undertake streamlining in order to maintain the domestic postal service, and all those who previously received salaries without working will be dismissed to save money. Upon reading this, we were extremely surprised. The number of personnel used by the post office has always been based on the complexity of the tasks. Even when each postal area adds personnel, the reasons and the number of personnel to be added must be submitted to the higher authorities for approval before proceeding. This can be used as proof. Therefore, the phenomenon of receiving a salary without working is definitely not possible in the post office. Since the Minister took office, he has been very concerned about the benefits of the transportation industry, and the associations admire his initiatives for reform. However, since this matter has no factual basis, it is sufficient to confuse and mislead outsiders. We suspect that it was a mistake by the news reporter. As for the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the employment and administration are different from the Postal Administration. Whether the above situation exists or whether the Minister's statement specifically refers to the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the associations have no way of knowing in detail. However, since it concerns the reputation of postal workers across the country, we hereby send a special telegram, requesting a solemn statement. We eagerly await your reply. Sincerely, Shanghai Postal Employees Union, Shanghai Postal Workers Union."</p>

However, because the directors were out, they did not achieve their goal, and a disturbance occurred.  With the persuasion of the police, the situation was resolved by the General Manager's reception at dusk. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Petition  The workers' union of the five wharves sent representatives Xue Yinkui, Fu Zhiyang, Li Angqing, Xue Xingbiao, Shan Xishou, Wu Jucai, Chen Shijun, Yu Xianting, and all the laid-off workers to the Board of Directors to present their petition at 2 PM yesterday afternoon.  The standing directors were out, and Director Yang Zhixiong received them. The representatives demanded that they be reinstated or given one year's severance pay. Yang said that the matter was important and promised to notify the standing directors immediately for a reply. Therefore, all the petitioners waited in the auditorium.</p>
<p>Disturbance  The Fourth Road General Police Station received a report and sent Chinese and foreign detectives to protect them. At 4 PM, Chinese foreman Jin Xinshan, Northern foreman He Tiehua, Southern foreman Li Yunsheng, Central foreman Fu Ruiquan, and New foreman Jin Yiru arrived at the Bureau one after another at the General Manager's call. All the laid-off workers questioned the foremen about the reasons for the layoffs, and the order was chaotic. Fortunately, the detectives stationed there dissuaded them, and the foremen took refuge in the General Manager's office. The laid-off workers guarded the front and back, it is said.</p>
<p>Visit to the General Manager  After 5 PM, the laid-off workers asked General Manager Liu Hongsheng to notify the standing directors for a reply. The General Manager ordered the selection of representatives. The union sent Yu Xianting and the laid-off workers' representatives Fu Zhiyang and Shan Xishou to meet with him. At 5:35 PM, the five wharf foremen, He Tiehua and others, left the Bureau under the armed protection of police detectives. The union representatives presented a petition to the General Manager and detailed the truth about the corruption of the foremen and the unfairness of the layoffs. The General Manager promised to submit the petition to the Board of Directors for consideration and then decide on a fair solution and reply. They did not disperse until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Evening General Assembly  All the laid-off workers felt that the petition had no practical solution and immediately lined up and returned to the Fifth Wharf Union. They held an emergency general assembly to discuss the final plan. Yu Xianting reported on the process first. Yu believed that the General Manager's reply was not satisfactory, and it was decided to continue to expand the petition to the Board of Directors on the 24th until the goal was achieved.</p>
<p>Maritime Students  In the second layoff of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, all twelve graduates of the first class of the Maritime Specialty School established by the company were laid off. It is reported that the students submitted a petition to the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and General Manager Liu yesterday, requesting them to withdraw the order and complete their studies.</p>

<p>The Nisshin Steamship Company's business in China is mainly on the Yangtze River, supplemented by North and South Ocean liners. Since the January 28th Incident last year, boycotts of Japanese ships have occurred everywhere, and the Nisshin River and Sea shipping business has plummeted. Currently, only four ships are operating on the Yangtze River, one ship is operating upstream, and more than a dozen ships are empty and moored in Shanghai. The Nanhua class business is even quieter, only sailing to Hong Kong. The company's business losses last year were huge. Now, the Japanese government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy are subsidizing all the company's expenses, so the company has been ordered to operate as usual and wait for the opportunity to develop. Therefore, the decline in business has nothing to do with the company itself.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Not to Overestimate Rent to Collect Donations <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Financial Management Must Consider Legality and Facts</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the First Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, our member, Yile Tian Teahouse at 513 Nanjing Road, and its affiliated Tong Yu Chun Teahouse at 463 Nanjing Road, stated that they received notices from the Public Works Department on December 23rd last year, informing our Yile Tian Teahouse that the annual house donation, which was previously 4,000 yuan, must be increased to 9,240 yuan from April 1st, and our affiliated Tong Yu Chun Teahouse, which paid 4,400 yuan, must be increased to 6,240 yuan, which is more than twice and one-third of the original amount. However, upon investigation, our teahouse and affiliated teahouse have been operating on Nanjing Road for more than ten years. The house donation has always been based on the rent ticket. Now, the Public Works Department is forcibly estimating the price, treating the rent of old houses as the expensive rent of newly renovated houses, which is unfair in principle. Moreover, our teahouse's business is light and profitable, and we usually make ends meet with copper coins. Since the January 28th Incident, our business has plummeted. If we are suddenly asked to increase the donation, it will be even more difficult to bear. We earnestly request your association to forward a letter to the Public Works Department, asking them to understand the difficulties of businesses and continue to collect donations according to the original amount, and to forward a request to the Citizens' General Association and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to provide consistent assistance, etc. Accordingly, the number of house donations is calculated based on the amount of rent, which is an immutable principle. If the Public Works Department wants to increase revenue and forcibly overestimate the rent in order to collect more donations, it is directly oppressive to the people and indirectly encourages landlords to increase rent prices, which hides the motive for the society to become increasingly insecure. This violates the Public Works Department's duty to maintain law and order. From the standpoint of a taxpayer, we cannot recognize the oppressive policy of estimating prices to collect donations, not only for businesses that are struggling to survive, but also in the state of paying donations according to the law. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to request your association to forward a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting that the house donations for Yile Tian and Tong Yu Chun should always be collected according to the original amount, and to stop similar administrative actions from being applied to any taxpayer in order to maintain social security and benefit citizens' businesses, etc. Upon approval of this, this case, in terms of legality, has a municipal general donation based on actual rent as a standard. It is absolutely impossible to overestimate the rent to increase revenue and increase the burden on taxpayers. Your Bureau also agrees with this principle, so it has punished a certain number on Shanxi Road for forging rent tickets. In terms of facts, the total donation of Yile Tian per year must be increased by 131%, from 4,000 yuan to 9,240 yuan, and Tong Yu Chun must be increased by 40%, from 4,400 yuan to 6,200 yuan. The two teahouses are commercial institutions, and their business has a certain limit on expenses. How can it suddenly swell? The national and local governments must also determine the method based on the presence or absence or increase or decrease of the tax source if they want to increase revenue and balance the budget. May I ask if there is a civil servant whose income is fixed? Suppose a certain expenditure of his suddenly increases by one or one-third above the previous level, how will he make up for his personal budget? Or it may be said that he can obtain a salary increase or subsidy from the public office to make up for it. This is indeed the current situation. However, suppose that under the difficult environment of public offices, various commercial and industrial enterprises cannot maintain themselves, and therefore go bankrupt and close down, resulting in a large number of unemployed, and public security is worrying, the cost of defense increases. At the same time, new houses such as the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in the Public Concession are not sought after, and old houses continue to be vacated. The revenue from general donations decreases, and even falls into the same plight as the depleted municipal finances of Chicago in the United States. What method will he use to obtain a salary increase or subsidy to make up for his insufficient personal budget? I am taking this opportunity to ask your Bureau to urgently formulate a financial policy to cope with the current situation: ㈠ Taxpayers and those who serve taxpayers should commonly endure the pain of economic depression. ㈡ Except for the costs of maintaining public security and improving citizens' intelligence, either reduce or even eliminate them. This association believes that Shanghai's business must rely on the purchasing power of the interior of the Yangtze River basin, which is almost equal to zero due to the Japanese disturbances, the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver, the floods in seven provinces, and the reason for the low price of shells harming farmers. Shanghai's commercial and industrial enterprises are all in a state of frugality and hardship. If donations and taxes are increased, and rents are increased again due to estimates, once the tenuous financial line is lost, the number of vacant houses will increase day by day, and the tax source will decrease day by day. At that time, the financial situation of your Bureau will be unknown. This association is deeply concerned. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to request your Bureau to carefully consider the law and facts in handling financial affairs. Sincerely, The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<h3 id="e131">Shui Mingchang Proposes Solution to Water Bill Issue <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>｜Real Estate Association Responds to Pay at Old Rate｜</p>
<p>Shui Mingchang, a member of the Real Estate Association and manager of an accounting firm, yesterday exchanged letters with the Real Estate Association regarding the case of water bills being five times higher after the installation of water meters. The letters are as follows: (Letter from Shui Mingchang) Respectfully, I have just received a water bill from the water company for the period from December 1st to December 16th, totaling $98.75. Upon investigation, based on the fixed water rate, the monthly water bill should be $38.43. Compared to the past, this is an increase of more than five times. Based on reason and fact, it is impossible to pay accordingly. In addition to sending a letter to the water company to protest, I am writing to your association to strongly advocate on our behalf to the water company to avoid unexpected losses. Regarding the water bill, should we delay payment, or pay according to the fixed water rate? I request your association to be responsible for guiding us. Upon investigation, this case has been delayed for many days, and we have no idea how to deal with the water company. If this continues, it will be endless. Based on my members' opinions, I propose the following: (1) Request the water company to install water meters for each tenant, and all methods should follow the methods of the power company. It would be unreasonable for landlords to pay for deposits and water meters, and we should firmly refuse to the end. (2) Request the water company to continue charging the fixed water rate, or add one, for each room with a rent of $30 or $50 or less, and not change the original agreement to avoid disputes. (3) If your association does not have a proper solution, you must inform each member to find their own solutions. (Reply from the Real Estate Association) Respectfully replying, we have received your letter of January 20th regarding the increase in water bills by five times after calculation by water meter. We understand everything. The two methods you proposed are very appropriate and have already been incorporated into previous statements. As for the payment method, since it is not yet formal, you can pay at the old rate pending a solution. A tripartite meeting will be held soon.</p>

<p>After the opening of the Sincere Company's National Goods Exhibition, the participating manufacturers, including Rongyin Knitting Factory, Linhua Woolen Mill, Fumin Underwear Factory, Fuhua Knitting Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Xie Feng Knitting Factory, Meifeng Glove Factory, Dabeichang, Huafu Factory, Huaguo Factory, Huali Factory, Qiming Factory, etc., held a celebratory banquet at the East Asia Restaurant the night before.

First, to thank Sincere Company for its efforts in promoting national goods and for the generous hospitality provided in advance. Second, during this national goods year, to seek advice from everyone on how to further promote national goods. Zheng Zhaobin, the manager of Sincere Company, then gave a reply, first expressing his gratitude and reporting that over 200,000 Chinese and foreign people had visited the national goods exhibition. In just three or four days, tens of thousands of dollars worth of samples were sold. This shows the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for promoting national goods. He then requested that each factory take responsibility for improving their products, and the department stores would do their best to promote them, so that the national goods trade would have great development. The guests and hosts dispersed in joy at ten o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e135">An Old Villager Shot and Killed <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yin Afu, a farmer from Xiaoliujiazhai in Baoshan County, had some savings. He recently received a threatening letter stating that "the end of the year is difficult to pass," demanding $1,200, otherwise they would take drastic measures. It was arranged that the money should be sent by someone carrying a vegetable basket to the Shuimenjiang Bridge near Sanguantang in Songbei on the afternoon of the previous day, where someone would collect it. Yin was terrified after receiving the letter because he had no such large sum of money. If he refused, his life would be in danger. He had no choice but to report to the Baoshan County Security Corps. After receiving the report, Director Yan ordered the corps members to disguise themselves as scheduled and go to the agreed location to lie in ambush. At about 4 PM on the previous day, the corps dispatched the squad leader leading many corps members to disguise themselves and wait. They deliberately placed a vegetable basket on the ground. At that time, a villager dressed person passed by and frequently asked the corps members how to get to Yuepu, while staring at the vegetable basket on the ground. The corps members suspected that his appearance was suspicious and tried to arrest him. The villager suddenly reached into his arms. Squad Leader Zhang suspected that he was reaching for a weapon and quickly fired a box cannon at him. The bullet hit his waist, and he fell to the ground and died. It is difficult to determine whether this person was a bandit. Yesterday, the corps director reported to the county government, and County Chief Jin sent officials to the scene for inspection in the morning. The inspection revealed that the deceased was nearly sixty years old, with slightly gray hair, wearing a cloth cotton robe and a blue cloth bamboo skirt. He had two pieces of salted meat on his back. There were no weapons beside him. There were several dollars in his pocket. The bullet entered from the waist and exited from the chest, causing death. Currently, no relatives have claimed the body, and the local bailiff will collect it.</p>

However, the examination results could not determine that she was not a virgin. Since then, Song has abused her, causing her to feel unable to live with him. She hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit for divorce and requested the court to order the defendant to compensate for losses, alimony, and dowry. Song also filed a counterclaim, stating that if they were to divorce, Tu should compensate for the marriage expenses. After repeated hearings by the First Special District Court, lasting almost a year, Judge Luo Chongtai announced the verdict yesterday morning, ordering the defendant Song Tianxiang to divorce Tu Fumei, and to compensate for losses of $440, pay alimony of $2,000, and return all of the plaintiff's dowry, or compensate $600 for the dowry. The plaintiff was responsible for nine-tenths of the litigation costs, and the defendant was responsible for one-tenth. The plaintiff's other claims and the defendant's counterclaim were dismissed. The costs of the counterclaim were borne by the counterclaimant. After the judgment, Judge Luo briefly stated the main points of the judgment, saying that the plaintiff left home because she could not live with the defendant, and had been away for one year and ten months. The minimum living expenses per month are $20, and based on this calculation, the defendant should compensate the plaintiff $440. As for the plaintiff's claim for alimony of $18,000, the amount is excessive. However, the defendant forced the plaintiff to undergo examinations for virginity up to four times, which must be regarded as a major insult. Therefore, considering the defendant's ability, he was ordered to pay $2,000, which is only one-tenth of what the plaintiff requested. Therefore, the defendant is also responsible for one-tenth of the litigation costs. Regarding the return of the dowry, the list opened by the plaintiff is exaggerated, but according to the testimony of witnesses, it can be known that there are indeed items worth six to seven hundred dollars. If the defendant fails to return the original items, he should compensate $600.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Stoker Died Tragically from Coal Gas Poisoning Due to Poor Ventilation of Coal Stove <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>｜Pay Attention to Those Burning Coal for Heating｜</p>
<p>Zhu Lairong, a 24-year-old from Tongzhou, worked as a stoker at the Luochang Construction Factory at 550 West Huade Road. The night before, Zhu, suffering from the cold, took a coal stove, burned coal in it, and placed it in his bedroom to provide heat. Then he closed the door and went to sleep alone. Unexpectedly, while Zhu was asleep, the coal gas could not escape, causing coal gas poisoning and loss of consciousness. The next day, Teng Lansheng, the head of the factory, went to see that the door was tightly closed and called out without response. Realizing that something was wrong, he found a way to open the door and saw Zhu collapsed on the bed. He immediately reported to the Huishan Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. Zhu was taken by car to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The body was taken to the Philander Road Corpse Examination Office. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Court and commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to inspect the body. During the public investigation, Teng Lansheng testified that when he walked into the deceased's bedroom, he saw that there were still embers in the coal stove and felt a strong coal gas smell in the room. At that time, the deceased was already unconscious, so he reported to the police station. Zhu Renrong, the deceased's younger brother, also testified. Guo determined that Zhu Lairong died of coal poisoning and ordered the corpse to be handed over to his younger brother Zhu Renrong to take back for burial.</p>

<p>A Pair of Sisters Were Both Kidnapped and Raped</p>
<p>Prostitute Ling Yao Ji Spreads Through Yangzhou City</p>
<p>Elder Sister Already Married, Younger Sister Speaks Freely of Love</p>
<p>All Three are Detained Pending Transfer of Documents</p>
<p>Feng Junrui from Jiangdu County Yangzhou First Stage, a Wu Sheng from Anhui, is quite talented and handsome, and young. Many women in the county with romantic tendencies have been seduced by him. The Bian family in the town is a prominent family in Weiyang, with Bian Shuluan and Bian Zhenhui. The two are sisters. Shuluan and Feng are the same age, thirty-nine years old, and have already been married. Zhenhui is twenty-nine years old and waiting to be married, currently studying at a certain school in Yangzhou. She is beautiful and takes a bus to the First Stage in her free time to listen to music. Her father has passed away for many years, and her widowed mother dotes on her and does not restrain her, so her presence is almost daily in the theater. If her older sister Shuluan returns to Ning, she will take her along. Over time, this pair of sisters became noticed by Ling Feng, and the sisters also felt that the Ling Feng was handsome and young and worthy of a lover. So, they actually practiced the act of secret trysts. Ling Feng's wish to have a double pleasure was also fulfilled. Although they were all secret affairs, it was difficult to keep the truth from being revealed. Thus, rumors spread and gradually reached the ears of the two beauties' families. It was said that they were prostituting and it became difficult to tolerate, so Ling Feng persuaded the Bian sisters to each roll up their clothes and escape together. The woman's mother reported to the Jiangdu County Public Security Bureau after the fact and requested an investigation. The bureau suspected that they might have fled to Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, so they sent detective Ju Hao with an arrest warrant to Shanghai to investigate their whereabouts. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was discovered that Ling Feng was enjoying tea at the Xiyuan Tea House at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Dagu Road in Xinzha. He immediately informed the Chinese police at No. 2441 of the nearby Mingtong and went to the tea house to arrest Ling Feng and take him to the Xinzha Police Station. Under interrogation, it was revealed that the Bian sisters were hiding at No. 16 Caishi Street in the French Concession. The police chief then sent detectives Liu Longchao and requested assistance from the French police to arrest the two women. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the First Special District Court. Judge Qian Wenzhong interrogated them. The Jiangdu detective Ju Hao requested that Feng and others be taken back to Yangzhou for questioning, but the police lawyer Wang Yaotang said that the detective was carrying an arrest warrant. If he wanted to transfer them, he should ask the detective to obtain a formal document from the Yangzhou authorities, so the case was requested to be postponed. Bian Zhenhui confessed that because her mother wanted to marry her to her brother-in-law as a concubine, which was not only not what she wanted, but also not wanted by her sister, she agreed with her sister to come to Shanghai with Feng. This was not her initiative, and she loved him. She spoke eloquently and without any shyness. She was even more beautiful than her sister. It is said that Ling Feng's acquisition of these two beauties, if not obtained by seduction, would be a truly great fortune. Currently, Feng and others are still temporarily detained, pending the arrival of documents from Jiangdu for verification.</p>

<p>Caused by Association Disputes</p>
<p>A Life is Lost for Nothing</p>
<p>Zhou Ronggui, the 28-year-old owner of the Zhou Wanxing Noodle Shop in Qinglong Bridge, Nanshi, was from Danyang. His deceased brother had a six-dollar association share with Jiang Boxian of Xing Juli No. 12 Nanhui Hall Road. After his brother's death, his sister-in-law remarried, but she declared to Jiang that her brother-in-law should not take the association money, otherwise she would not recognize it. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (22nd), Zhou Ronggui went to the association stall and won the association share. Jiang refused to hand it over because his sister-in-law had said so, and told him that if he wanted to take the money, he had to find a guarantor. Zhou agreed and left. At 6:30 PM, he came again. According to Jiang Boxian, Zhou gathered two Jiangbei thugs, one of whom had a gun. He was having dinner at the time and was threatened with a gun, forcing him to take more than 140 dollars from his pocket. However, while the two sides were arguing, Jiang's wife ran outside and reported to the police that there was a robbery with a gun, and that there were guns, etc. Liu Lindong, a winter defense policeman on duty in Zone One, Substation One, came with his rifle. After receiving the report, he rushed into the house with his gun. The so-called two Jiangbei thugs had disappeared. Only Zhou Ronggui was still in the house, being held by Jiang, who was pulling on his long clothes. The police officer entered the room, and Zhou tore his clothes and broke free, escaping out of the door. The police officer shouted to stop him. Zhou rushed out, and his hand seemed to be raised upwards. The police officer immediately thought it was resistance and aimed, shooting Zhou in the head. The bullet hit his left cheekbone, exited from the left brain, and the hole was as big as a bowl. Brain matter flowed out, and he immediately fell dead in the courtyard. The police officer shone a flashlight on him and realized that he was an acquaintance. At that time, the security corps gathered and sent Jiang and his wife and the police officer to Zone One, Substation One. After interrogation by Section Chief Yi, they were immediately transferred to the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning and then transferred to the District Court for verification. Qin Defang, the land bailiff of the Twenty-third Shop, was ordered to report to the hospital for examination. Prosecutor Yang and others were commissioned to inspect the scene and ordered the corpse to be collected, pending strict interrogation and thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Meng Lanting Sentenced to Ten Years for Murder</p>
<p>Zhang Yanxia, a Kunqu opera singer at the Sincere Amusement Park on Nanjing Road, was originally acquainted with Meng Lanting, a painter who drew scenery for the amusement park. Later, she disliked Meng's age and became deeply involved with Zhang Agao, a young rogue, even practicing the principle of "subsidizing" him, leading to the pawning of all her possessions. However, Zhang Agao's desires were insatiable. On account of the singer, he frequently demanded money from Meng Lanting for his extravagant spending. At 3:30 PM on the 10th of this month, Zhang suddenly broke into Meng's studio to borrow money. Unable to get it, they clashed. Zhang injured Meng's arm, and Meng immediately grabbed a hatchet and repeatedly struck Zhang's head and other parts of his body, causing him to fall to the ground. Zhang was quickly sent to the hospital by the police, but due to the fatal injuries, he soon died. Meng and Zhang Yanxia were detained and sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, the court found that Zhang, the singer, was not involved and ordered her immediate release. Meng Lanting was detained for further investigation. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Meng has been prosecuted for murder. The criminal court of the court, presided over by Judge Qian Wenji, repeatedly summoned witnesses and concluded the investigation. Yesterday morning was the sentencing date. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi and the defendant's defense lawyer Fan Gang appeared in court as scheduled. At 9:00 AM, Judge Qian ascended the bench and ordered the defendant to be sentenced. Meng Lanting was found guilty of murder and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. After the sentence was pronounced, Meng was taken back to the police station by the police to await confirmation and then be sent to prison to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Robbery on Xinjiang Road: Two Robbers Caught <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, a robbery occurred at No. 6 Dazheng Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. When the victim, Zhang Meigang, was having lunch with his family, five robbers suddenly arrived outside the door. Only one of the robbers had a gun. After knocking on the door and entering, they threatened the family, forbidding them from making any noise. The armed robber locked everyone in the house in the back room to watch over them, while the remaining robbers rushed upstairs, ransacking boxes and chests, and searching each room. After about an hour, they escaped with their loot. At this time, the victim saw that the robbers had fled, so he rushed out and saw one of the robbers still walking in front. He followed him secretly until near the Pot Lane intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Seeing three or four Chinese police officers patrolling, the victim immediately went up and reported the crime. The police quickly caught up and arrested two robbers, seizing the stolen goods and two pistols from them. They were taken to the police station. Under interrogation by the police chief, the two identified themselves as Li Changsheng, from Pudong, 28 years old, and Zhou Heshang, from Yangzhou, 25 years old. However, the location of the crime was in the Fourth District, and the victim reported the case to the Fourth District Office. Later, they sent officers to transfer the case to the police station to investigate and arrest the accomplices before further processing the case. The victim's losses included a pair of pearl bracelets, a pair of gold bracelets, a gold watch, a gold ring, a fox fur coat, and 95 yuan in cash, totaling over a thousand yuan.</p>

<p>World chess champion Alekhine will arrive in Shanghai today on the President Taft. He is expected to stay for a week. The Shanghai International Chess Club held a meeting last night at the YMCA to discuss welcome arrangements and to hope that Alekhine would give one or two performances to show off his unique skills and satisfy the audience. It is said that Alekhine can simultaneously play 50 games during regular performances, and even without personally witnessing the chess board, he can simultaneously play 50 games based on the movements of the pieces reported by two or three people. He can truly be called an extraordinary person with extraordinary chess skills. Several chess players in Shanghai have requested to play against Alekhine during his performances. Mr. Dupin of the YMCA is handling this matter. Those who wish to play against him can register and pay a fee of ten yuan to cover the performance expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Prostitute and Dancer in Mutual Assault Lawsuit <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Bixia, a prostitute from Zhejiang, 22 years old, and Hua Xiaochun, a prostitute from Suzhou, 23 years old, both advertised their services at No. 78 Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Road. Bixia had a sister in the same profession, Zhang Meimei (16 years old), a Shanghai woman who worked as a dancer at the Yue Gong dance hall and also lived with Bixia. On the night of the 3rd of this month, at 8:00 PM, Zhang Meimei and Hua Xiaochun suddenly quarreled over a minor matter and then physically assaulted each other. Zhang was injured and lost a diamond ring. The case was reported to the Eighth Precinct Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Hua and send her to the First Special Court. After interrogation by the judge, Hua Xiaochun was fined 30 yuan. Hua refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. At the same time, she hired lawyer Cao Lin to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Bixia and Zhang Meimei of false accusation and assault under Articles 180 and 293 of the Criminal Law. The reason was that on the 3rd of this month, Zhang Meimei first insulted the plaintiff, and then Bixia directed the assault, injuring Hua's arms and other parts of her body. Hua resisted slightly, and then the defendants falsely accused her of assault and robbery, leading to her being fined. At the time, the plaintiff also stated that she was injured in the assault, but the court stated that the police had not reported it and instructed her to file a separate lawsuit, which is why she filed the complaint. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhao Linyu of the First Special Court's Criminal Division summoned the defendants Bixia and Zhang Meimei, who also hired lawyer Yu Jun to defend them. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Xuan, stated the main points of the lawsuit. The court stated that the case required reviewing the previous case file and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Society, the United Xinwei Relief Society, and the Moral General Society jointly organized winter relief in the war-torn areas. They received 278 bags of relief rice and 2,000 yuan from the Xinwei Relief Society, 5,000 yuan from the Moral Society, and 42 shi and 7 dou of relief rice from the Wusong Municipal Committee Office. The rest was allocated and distributed by the Jisheng Society itself. Mr. Zhang Junxian was publicly elected as the director, and along with relief workers Li Yunmen, Gu Yabin, and others, they conducted daily on-site investigations in the severe winter wind and snow. They distributed to over 880 extremely poor households in Dachang and the east of the railway, spending 3,228 yuan. The war trenches in that area were filled, and labor relief and repairs were made to one road bridge and two other bridges, spending 1,800 yuan, 100 bags of rice, and 150 sets of cotton clothing. They distributed to over 1,420 households in the four villages of Jiangwan and the town, spending 9,128 yuan and 200 sets of cotton clothing.

In total, Zhabei winter relief spent over 19,480 yuan, 178 bags of rice, another 42 shi and 7 dou, 850 sets of relief clothing, and 50 cotton quilts. The disaster situation in each area is extremely widespread, and disaster victims are crying out for help. At this time of harsh winter weather, they are suffering from both hunger and cold, making it difficult to reach everyone. With limited resources and many in need, we are truly ashamed to say that we have done little to help.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Development of New Shipping Route at Doulong Port <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of Large-Scale Salt Warehouses</p>
<p>Jiangbei's Yancheng and Funing are salt-producing areas. Salt is traditionally transported to Hunan and Hubei, which requires transfer to ships at Haizhou, incurring huge costs. Now, Finance Minister Song Ziwen plans to establish a large-scale salt warehouse near the coastal areas of Haizhou, Yancheng, and Funing to centralize the production and sales of salt in the Yancheng and Funing areas. The warehouse will be able to hold 200,000 to 300,000 tons of Huai salt. The Ministry of Finance has appointed specialists to conduct on-site surveys in the Yancheng and Funing areas. The results indicate that Doulong Port, located north of the Sheyang River and inside Xinyang Port and Yaosha, is a good harbor area that does not freeze in winter and has deep water. It is close to Xiaogang Town, making it a convenient route for transporting salt produced in Yancheng and Funing. After the survey, it was decided to build the largest salt warehouse in the Huai area, sufficient for storing 300,000 tons of salt. The materials for building the warehouse have been purchased from Europe and America. The three items of hardware, cement, and wood alone total 50,000 tons and have already been shipped to Shanghai. As the salt warehouse is about to start construction, these materials will be transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) ships. When the salt warehouse is built, a new shipping route will be opened at Doulong Port. Discussions have been held with CMSNC to add Shanghai-Doulong Port liners. CMSNC has instructed Shen Zhiyou, the special commissioner in Haizhou, to investigate the water depth in the area to facilitate ship operation and transport of the large batch of warehouse materials.</p>

<p>The house at No. 35 Tai'an Lane, North Shaanxi Road, was broken into by robbers at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, who stole clothing and silver dollars.

He also requested that the seized silver dollars, which belonged to the Li Shunfu family, be returned first. Judge Qian ruled that the case be postponed until next Wednesday morning for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Divorce Lawsuit of "Spring Dreams in the Old Capital" Actress Sang Shuzhen <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Bin, courtesy name Yaosheng, from Minhang Town in Shanghai County, is the son of Zhang Yunxi, the owner of Zhang Yimao Rice Shop in North Street, Minhang, and possesses considerable wealth. After graduating from Peking National University in Peiping in his early years, Zhang worked in the Ministry of Communications. Later, he was transferred to the Shanghai Telecommunications Section of the Ministry of the Navy, and then to the Ministry of the Navy. He currently serves as a telecommunications engineer in the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department. He is very busy with public affairs and earns a good income. During the first year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang met Sang Xiuying (currently 45 years old), a respectable woman from Changshu, Suzhou, who was 21 years old at the time. She was studying at the Jinghai Women's School in Suzhou. She was intelligent and skilled in poetry and prose, and both her parents had passed away. Zhang and Sang became acquainted, and their friendship developed into marital love. They married in Zhang's home in Minhang in the first year of the Republic of China, and their marital relationship was very close. However, they had no children. Years ago, when Zhang was in Peiping, he fell in love with a woman and had a son named Zhaozhong, whom he brought back and handed over to Sang to raise. Zhaozhong is now 16 years old and is taught at home by Sang. Unexpectedly, around 1926, Zhang suddenly changed and married a concubine, a woman from Wuxi named Lu, who is 31 years old this year. Lu lives with Sang in No. 11 Yongyu Lane, Belle Road, French Concession. When Zhang married the concubine, he asked someone to mediate with Sang, and the two parties agreed on four terms. Later, the wife and concubine inevitably became jealous of each other, causing Zhang and Sang's marital love to break down from then on. Zhang stopped paying Sang's monthly expenses and ignored her livelihood. Sang's appeals were ineffective and met with disdain. At this point, Sang, unable to bear the suffering, took her son and moved out, renting a room in the pavilion on the first floor of No. 9 Guifu Lane, Baille Road, Taiping Bridge. She has been over-pawning her belongings. Last year, due to financial difficulties, she joined the Lianhua Film Company as a supporting actress in the sequel "Spring Dreams in the Old Capital," playing the role of Sang Shuzhen, which is Sang's alias. Recently, she has been living in sorrow, while Zhang and his concubine Lu reside in Zhenjiang, neglecting her. This situation cannot continue for long. Realizing that her strength is gradually declining and she will be unable to earn a living, she has no choice but to hire lawyer Zhu Dianqing to represent her in filing a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Zhang and Lu, ordering them to pay alimony and education expenses for her son, totaling 29,500 yuan, and returning the seized items. The court has accepted the petition and issued summonses to be delivered to both parties, scheduling a mediation hearing for 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>The Health Bureau Compiles "Battlefield Hygiene": The Municipal Health Bureau has always been known for its perfect health facilities. Since Li Ting'an took office as director, its promotion has become even more evident. He provides guidance to all levels of staff from time to time, seeking to achieve the realization of the Shanghai health plan. Every Monday, Li uses the opportunity of the weekly memorial service to lecture on various health issues to increase the experience of the staff. He is particularly concerned about education and health. On Saturdays, he also gathers a group of health personnel to lecture on educational health, sometimes inviting staff from various schools to participate in the lectures. All of these show Li's attention to health. Li recently felt that foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent and the national situation is in danger. Battlefield hygiene is particularly important. Earlier this month, he ordered Shen Gao, the chief of the first section, to lead all the staff in a thorough study and compile "Battlefield Hygiene." Li participated in the discussions and devoted himself to editing in his spare time. In the future, he plans to print the work as a book and donate it to the army everywhere. The work will be largely completed in two weeks, and after Li has reviewed it, it will be sent to press to broaden the view. After publication, it will be distributed to the army nationwide in the hope that the soldiers will have a way to borrow from it in various hygiene matters on the battlefield and when stationed, so as to strengthen the soldiers' physique and prevent epidemics. However, the printing is a large task, and Director Li is currently raising funds.</p>

<p>| Letter from Liang Jun |</p>
<p>I am twenty years old this year, and I am confident in my strong physique. Three years ago, I graduated from junior middle school, but due to my poor family circumstances, I had to drop out of school. Through a friend's introduction, I got a job in an agency, where I spend all day copying documents and enduring the faces of others. I work for over ten hours a day and manage to earn thirty yuan a month. However, my parents, younger brother, and younger sister make a total of five people in my family. With my elderly father and young siblings, the entire family's livelihood depends on my shoulders. No matter how frugal we are, we always feel that our expenses are not covered. If an unexpected event occurs, it would be even harder to cope. I am inherently unwilling to beg for pity from others, and now I often think about finding some side jobs to do—I have time in the mornings to help people with copying or bookkeeping—but I lack connections. I also plan to save one or two yuan from my allowance each month to prepare for emergencies, but in reality, it is difficult to implement. Looking ahead, how am I supposed to cope with this livelihood problem? Secondly, my profession, as mentioned above, is a clerk's life, which I often feel is not suited to my personality. The hardship of the work is worse than that of cattle and horses, and I am often looked down upon. If I quit, given the circumstances of my family, where would I go to find food? I know that this is all due to a lack of specialized skills and academic experience. Therefore, I am now eager to learn some specialized skills and knowledge, such as accounting, bookkeeping, surveying, etc.—but I am limited by my working hours and financial capabilities, so it is difficult to achieve my wishes. Moreover, there are very few people now who can truly teach me practical skills, and even if there are tutorial schools, I dare not try them lightly! How can this be remedied?</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter raises two questions, but in reality, it is just the overall structure of the social economy. However, our answer will be divided into the following three items: ㈠ Worker treatment issues. In the current social organization, class distinctions are extremely strict. The abuse of lower-level workers by upper-level personnel is a very common phenomenon. If you still hope to find better treatment than others in the various agencies of this vast urban society, that is an illusion, because all crows are generally black. This is not a moral issue, but an entire economic issue, an entire social issue. It is best to: on the one hand, temporarily endure and continue working; on the other hand, workers should unite and seek ways to improve the situation. If your vision is only focused on yourself and your family, you will never turn around. ㈡ Family life issues. How can a young junior middle school graduate like you bear the burden of a family of five? It is truly pitiful. This will naturally not be a problem in a country with future social changes, or in a society after the elimination of the state; because in such a society, the education of all children of workers, peasants, and the poor should be borne by society, and the old, weak, orphaned, disabled, and sick should be supported by society. However, in China, and even in the highly developed capitalist countries of Europe and America, this level cannot be achieved. Not only can this level not be achieved, but on the one hand, wealth is being created day by day, and on the other hand, poverty is being created day by day. This is an inevitable phenomenon of the current privately owned production society. From this perspective, unless the entire problem is resolved, your family problem will be difficult to resolve. ㈢ Study issues. Since you are doing the hard work of copying from morning until night, it naturally seems that you no longer have the possibility of continuing your studies in terms of economy and time; however, both "specialized skills and knowledge" must be honed and cultivated through the struggle of practical life. If you are good at seizing opportunities and "stealing leisure from busy work" to read and make up for your "skills" and knowledge, it is not without hope of success; with your junior middle school level, you can also learn accounting, bookkeeping, and surveying on your own. As for the cultivation of various common sense knowledge, you only need to take the time to read more books, and you will naturally benefit from opening them. Reading in practical life is more intimate, flavorful, and rewarding than reading in school, which cannot be described in words. For the sake of general public's after-work self-cultivation, this newspaper has set up a circulating library in the Mainland Commercial Center, so that general young clerks and workers have the opportunity to satisfy their intellectual needs. You may also want to borrow some books to read. There are very few good tutorial schools, so if you can work hard to study on your own, it seems that you don't need to try them, which would only waste money and time.</p>

In addition, the game between You'ai and Meigong, although there was no good performance, was evenly matched and difficult to separate. The result was 20 to 20.

<h3 id="e170">Preliminary Thoughts on Reorganizing the National Normal School System (Part 1) Luo Tingguang <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>After the failure of the combined middle school and normal school system pilot program (Note 1), all provinces have shown a trend of changing course. Zhejiang took the lead in establishing independent normal schools and rural normal schools. Jiangsu announced the "Outline for Improving Jiangsu Normal Education Plan" in September of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), and from this year, designated Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Taicang, Huaiyin, Donghai, Jiaogao, and other middle schools in the province to specialize in normal education and stop recruiting ordinary middle school students. In the spring of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), Jiangxi also formulated a separate normal education plan for the entire province, ordering the senior high school departments of the original middle schools to stop recruiting normal school students from the next year. The newly established provincial normal school has already been established in Nanchang. Many other provinces are also preparing to reform their systems.</p>
<p>Not only that, Article 5 of the "Educational Goals and Implementation Guidelines of the Republic of China" promulgated by the National Government in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) stipulated that normal education should be "independently established within the scope of possibility." The "Normal School Law" drafted by the Ministry of Education and passed by the Legislative Yuan in its 214th meeting in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) (Note 2) was also promulgated by the Ministry of Education on January 19th of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), ordering all provinces to handle it in accordance with this law from the next semester of this year. Furthermore, the "Educational Reform Plan" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in December of last year recognized "teacher education" as one of the important educational goals, not only confirming the spirit of independence of normal education, but also making slight provisions for the treatment and service of normal school students, etc. The original proposal was resolved as follows:</p>
<p>"1. Secondary normal education institutions, such as simplified normal schools and normal schools, should be run by the government. 2. Normal schools should be separated from middle schools and established independently. 3. Existing normal universities should strive to reorganize and improve their organization, curriculum, and training to make them suitable for training secondary school teachers, so as to distinguish them from ordinary universities and to seek closer ties with normal schools, etc. 4. Universities should set up teacher training classes. All university graduates who wish to become teachers should enter this class to add one year of education courses to prepare for the selection of secondary school teachers. 5. Normal schools and normal universities do not charge tuition fees. Normal schools should, in principle, provide government-supplied food, lodging, and uniforms. 6. After normal school and normal university students have completed their studies, the Ministry of Education or the provincial education department or the municipal education bureau will assign them to service locations. Graduation certificates will only be issued after the term expires, and they will be free to apply for jobs or further education. Those who evade service or do not serve diligently will have their qualifications revoked and their fees recovered."</p>
<p>It is evident that the independence of normal education has practically ceased to be a problem in principle. However, at the beginning of the reform, there are many complicated matters, and it is difficult to achieve an appropriate solution without comprehensive planning. Based on the spirit of independence of normal education, with reference to the normal school systems of various countries, focusing on the improvement of domestic normal education, I have arrived at the following overall recommendations:</p>
<p>1. Based on the meaning of normal education, use scientific methods to specify the concrete goals of training primary and secondary school teachers. This is the most basic procedure. Based on the national educational goals, specify the purpose of teacher education, and then specify the concrete goals of training teachers at all levels based on the purpose of teacher education. The steps are very natural. The so-called concrete goals refer to the knowledge, abilities, character, spirit, ideals, interests, etc. (Note 3) that teachers should possess, obtained by scientific methods. This is the criterion for implementing teacher education and seeking to connect teacher training institutions at all levels. Unfortunately, this has not been achieved in previous discussions of the normal school system, which is a great pity. 2. All teacher training institutions should adhere to the principle of "impartiality." Normal education is the mother of national education, and its good or bad is closely related to the future of the country. Therefore, various types of education may be undertaken by private individuals, but normal education must be run by the government. This has already become a convention in European and American countries, with no question about it.</p>

<h3 id="e171">This Season's First Wonderful Basketball: Military Academy Loses to Pirates by Four Points <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>

<p>Military Academy Leads by One Point in the First Half, Falls Behind in the Second Half</p>
<p>The Whole Game is Infinitely Thrilling, Both Teams Rise and Fall</p>
<p>As a result of last night's fierce battle between the Central Military Academy basketball team and the Xiqing Pirates, they unfortunately lost by four points with a score of forty-one to forty-five, which was taken advantage of by the Pirates. The atmosphere was tense, leading to a white-hot situation. The whole game was infinitely thrilling, rising and falling, and the victory was only decided in the last minute. It can be called the first wonderful performance of this season. In the first half, the Military Academy took the lead by one point, twenty-one to twenty. The Military Academy will rest tonight and fight Mai Ling tomorrow night.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Infinitely Wonderful <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Last night's dramatic battle was infinitely wonderful, the first of this season. Under the strong defense of a formidable opponent, the Military Academy was able to pounce and score. Li Gongyu's wonderful shots and Wang Shixuan's defense were masterpieces. Even center Huang Jianding, who was slightly weak in the first two games, also made several successful long-range shots last night. As for the Qing Pirates, they had never encountered such a strong opponent. The defense was tight and unprecedented. The offense was full of thorns, and there were times when they had the ball but nowhere to shoot. The shooting skills of the two, Qier and Smith, were amazing. Both sides exhausted all their skills.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Unpredictable Situation <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The changes in the course of the whole game, the thrills within, are difficult to describe in detail. Rising and falling, there was no way to speculate. Sometimes it was a tie, sometimes it was one point up or down. At the beginning of the game, the Military Academy took the lead, the Pirates rose later, and the Military Academy equalized again. The Pirates rose again, and the Military Academy exceeded one point and won. This was the situation in the first half. The Pirates rose up, their momentum was rampant, and they scored continuously, exceeding by four points. The largest distance was as many as ten points. The Military Academy counterattacked and fought to only one point behind, with only two minutes remaining. Unfortunately, the Pirates won four more points. Although the Military Academy made another free throw, the result was a loss by four points.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Lucky and Unlucky <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The strength of the two teams, the Pirates were only slightly better. The Pirates had a strategy of not disrupting the system. Starting in the second half, breaking through the five-man joint defense of the Military Academy was the reason for their victory. Qier and Smith were confident in their shooting. The danger of Qier was even greater. The failure of the Military Academy can also be called lucky and unlucky. The opportunities to throw the ball were more than the Pirates, but they were all off by inches, or hit the hoop, without falling in, or even entered the basket and came out again. Moreover, Wang Shixuan slipped under the basket twice without scoring, and Li Gongyu missed many shots, only a thread away, which was a pity. The Military Academy's late start was also a mistake.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Scene at the Venue <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Xiqing ball room, up and down, was watertight. The battle started at eight o'clock. Although the Pirates got the jump ball, it was still won by the Military Academy. After several advances and retreats, Li Gongyu turned over under the basket, and the ball went in. However, after Smith's free throw and Qier's shot, the Pirates exceeded by one point with a score of three to two. The athletes of the Military Academy were full of vigor, and they made two consecutive free throws and scored. Li Gongyu came again with a ball, and the score was six to three, twice as high as the Pirates. The military momentum was vast, and the whole venue cheered loudly, placing infinite hope on the Military Academy.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Difficult to Separate <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>However, the Pirates soon arrived. After Smith and Qier's mutual scoring, after the score was tied at seven to seven, they added seven points in a row, exceeding by one time with a score of fourteen to seven. The Military Academy did not feel discouraged by this. After making a free throw, Huang Jianding made a long-range shot from halftime, and the two generals, Li and Huang, scored three more goals, and the colors were evenly divided. It was a situation of fourteen to fourteen again. It was really a case of evenly matched opponents. Seeing the fierce situation, the Pirates quickly adjusted and called Qier to rest, and brought in Xiao Shiguli.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Leading by One Point <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Shiguli scurried around, and he did manage to break in once. The Pirates were ahead with a score of eighteen to fourteen. The Military Academy did not move slightly, and continued to work hard, and even scored four points in a row. The score was still ahead with nineteen to eighteen. Seeing that the defense was not good, Sullivan was recorded with three fouls, and Traje was hurriedly brought in to replace Sullivan. In a turn, the first half ended, and the Military Academy won by one point with a score of twenty-one to twenty.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Defense Breakthrough <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, although Huang Jianding casually waved his hand at halftime and threw the ball into the basket, the situation changed drastically from then on. The Military Academy maintained its five-man joint defense method, and the Pirates adopted a slow-moving method, taking the form of a large encirclement, getting the opportunity to penetrate along the edge and shoot the ball from the corner. The five-man joint defense became fixed. Once it was broken, it was broken. The Pirates went smoothly from then on, scoring thirteen points in a row. One loss after another, the score became thirty-five to twenty-two. The Military Academy was ten points behind.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Quickly Catching Up <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Under this sudden change of situation, the Military Academy urgently changed the lineup, adjusting Qu Xingcun to replace Huang Jianding and changing Li Gongyu to jump forward, and quickly catching up. A sudden improvement was seen. Li Gongyu was single-handedly, and was often seen going straight in. Wang Shixuan supported him from behind, one ball after another, one point closer to one point. Sure enough, as a result of the whole army's struggle, the score became forty to forty-one, only one point behind. The whole venue shouted, and everyone was pounding, unaware of themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Final Defeat <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Pirates hurriedly called for a temporary break, and the timer reported that there were still three minutes left. Unexpectedly, in these three minutes, the Military Academy temporarily returned to failure. After Bai Nate scored, Smith scored again. The crowd knew that the announcement was hopeless. The last hope was that Liu Nuochang scored with a free throw, adding one point to make the score forty-five to forty-one. The Pirates won. Although, the Military Academy has been very commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Change Venue for Another Battle <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Military Academy coach Yu Jie yesterday arranged with the Pirates to change the venue for another battle. He intends to use the Chinese Basketball Hall, as the arena is spacious and allows for comfortable play. The Military Academy can fully demonstrate its strengths. However, Pirates leader White had not fully agreed, saying he would discuss it with the team members before deciding, showing his hesitation. The Military Academy is scheduled to host a banquet for the press at the Wei Ya Lou tonight.</p>

<p>— Zhong Xian</p>
<p>New and Old</p>
<p>Shanghai is the entry point for all new things in China. The world's newly invented things, whether they are foreign goods or new ideas, are transported to Shanghai by large ships and then sold and transferred to the interior of China.</p>
<p>Chinese who help foreigners sell foreign goods are called "Jiangwan Ferry." Those who help foreigners instill new ideas have not yet been given a special name. Perhaps in the future they will be called "Foreign Ferry." Because "foreign" is broader than "river," the foreign ferry is greater than the river ferry.</p>
<p>"Shanghai gets the jump on trends" has become a common saying, and Shanghai people are proud of it. This is the result of the foreign ferry's efforts.</p>
<p>Everything is fresh in Shanghai. Shanghai people's every move can be a model for inland people. The "Shanghai style" represents the "new style." In the future, new dictionaries may use the word "Shanghai" to mean "new."</p>
<p>A few years ago, Shanghai people wore tight-mouthed shoes, and villagers going to wedding banquets would hang a white copper "shoehorn" on their waists. Shanghai people smoked cigarettes, and the damp tobacco pipes in the countryside rotted. When Shanghai women wore cheongsams, women from the countryside did not dare to wear skirts when they came to the city.</p>
<p>When Shanghai people die, many use foreign coffins in the style of sleeping boxes. However, Shanghai funerals, except for church members, still use many flag-bearers and umbrella-holders, showing a complete feudal color.</p>
<p>On the asphalt roads of the 20th century, there are parades of thousands of years. The Shanghai people with new minds do not feel that it is out of harmony, but the people in the inland feel very strange!</p>
<p>Shanghai people are new in life, but only after death do they reveal their old fox tails.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Poverty and Life <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Shen</p>
<p>The Poorer, the More Artistic</p>
<p>I remember the philosopher Schopenhauer having a novel and witty exposition on poverty. He said: Only poverty can train life; only in poverty can one experience the joys and sorrows of the world. The poorer, the more artistic, because the poorer, the more one can recognize the true face of the world. Finally, Schopenhauer also made this judgment: "Every life should be baptized by poverty."</p>
<p>As for me personally, I have praised the world for the sake of poverty, and I have cursed the world!</p>
<p>I have an uncle who has an unusually optimistic and insightful view of the occasional wealth and poverty in life. He said: Poor people are not all people with weak talents. Many are unappreciated. As for the wealthy, not all of them have become wealthy by relying on their true talents and learning, but mostly by relying on luck. Therefore, whenever someone asks my uncle to borrow money, as long as my uncle thinks it is necessary to lend, he will give it to them no matter how much. My uncle is most opposed to writing IOUs. He said that since he is willing to lend, why write an IOU? Writing an IOU is to look down on the person borrowing money. If he has credit, he will definitely come back to pay it back in the future, otherwise, just consider it a gift to him, because when borrowing, there is always considerable emotion before he is willing to lend it to him. This is because my uncle has also come from poverty, experienced the taste of poverty, and had the training of poverty, so he has a unique view of poverty!</p>
<p>It seems that another sage also had a clear revelation about poverty: He said that if you want to make sincere friends, you must do so in times of poverty and frustration; when you are rich and successful, there are only friends who indulge in wine and meat! It is truly a wise saying. I often see many people in the world who are trapped in poverty, groaning in sorrow and annoyance, which I think is too foolish! God's endowment to the poor is not weak; it gives you sincere friends to warm your life; it gives you ruthlessness and indifference to experience life; for the sake of poverty, it has increased a lot of upward efforts; for the sake of poverty, it has eradicated places of paper and gold intoxication, haha; isn't poverty the most artistic?</p>
<h3 id="e186">Historical Lessons <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>| Starting with the Yangzhou Massacre |</p>
<p>According to historical accounts, during the Yangzhou Massacre at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were more than 100,000 residents in the city, while the Manchu Qing soldiers who killed anyone they met numbered only 500. Five hundred people slaughtered for ten days without encountering any resistance. This is truly shocking! The shock lies not only in the fierceness of the massacre but also in how easily it was carried out. We think of the painful history of the past, and in sadness, we cannot help but feel a bit of shame.</p>
<p>We all think this way: If the thousands of families in Yangzhou at that time each sent one or two strong men to deal with the 500 Qing soldiers, no matter what the result, it would not have been so tragic.</p>
<p>The "September 18th Incident," the "January 28th Incident," and even the cruelty of Japanese rogues killing Chinese people after the fall of Yuguan are similar to the Manchu Qing soldiers massacring Yangzhou. When they came, they were often in groups of five or six. They ran into a street and killed whoever they wanted. The lives of the residents in the street were in their hands. Although the number of residents was thousands or hundreds of times greater than the Japanese rogues, we only heard of five or six of them acting fiercely there, and we never heard of thousands or hundreds of times greater showing any strength at all. Many lost their lives while trying to escape by chance. Friends, rather than die like this, why not gather together to resist? Resistance will certainly involve sacrifice, but this sacrifice is a sacrifice with a price, at least it can frustrate some of the enemy's ferocity; speaking of the word 'face', it is much more glorious!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Clam <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bing</p>
<p>| Thoughts on the Four Seasons |</p>
<p>It is said that clams are a kind of self-dead worm, then I am just an immature clam.</p>
<p>I don't have any pessimism, I just feel that everything is too empty and lacks vitality.</p>
<p>From spring to winter, the years go by in a cycle. From the motherly spring to the fatherly severe winter, the climate is constantly changing, but I have not realized it at all.</p>
<p>People say that spring has arrived, really, spring has arrived, ah, it only adds to my annoyance; the heavy thunder awakens the life of tree insects, and revives people's youth, but forgets to awaken the deep nightmares of last night. I stepped on the green grass, holding willow branches, chasing the stopped bird sounds; I walked out of the lightly fluttering willow forest again, sending off the setting sun.</p>
<p>The scorching sun arrives, this is summer. The days are even more dull, but so long, I really want to be a Kuafu chasing the sun, chasing this sun, earlier to the west. Ah, hot summer, it is so hot, but it fans the entire earth, but it cannot fan my cold heart.</p>
<p>Seeing that the grass and trees are about to decline again, this is a symbol of my life! Autumn, generally sad.</p>
<p>The harsh winter, the sand-like snowflakes, scattered and flying, it hides the darkness of the world, and builds some light for people. The whole year, only this season gives me some comfort, I often think, stepping on the snow, on this cold winter night, to find some sympathy.</p>
<p>Ah, I am not annoyed, anyway this is not annoyance.</p>
<p>Understanding one's own pain, this is not annoyance. The most annoying thing is that I cannot grasp my own pain. If I can find the answer to what annoys me, I will grasp this point and untie this net that binds my heart. But, ...... expectations are far away.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Hometown <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tiwei</p>
<p>Second, they only care about driving and don't care about cleaning up the car. Because cleaning up the car is inevitably close to vulgarity and should be handled by a group of short-clothed villagers in C Township. Therefore, a car will not retire until it is on its last breath and terminally ill. Third, in the evening, since there is no official business to handle, they have to gamble to pass the time, and all-night mahjong is very common. Dropping the dominoes and going to drive, although the feeling of the fingertips is particularly sensitive, it is inevitable that there will be a few unlucky travelers who will occasionally receive the gift of stroke cards and become people in deep boudoir dreams. As a result, a group of gentlemen in C Township who know their fate must solemnly and solemnly teach young people traveling to other places:</p>
<p>"You young people only know how to be fast. Humph! C Township's cars must not be tried lightly!" However, Hongye felt that seeing her father's sick face was more important than her own life safety. These newspaper records can only be regarded as exceptions. The stationmaster in his slippers and Zhongshan suit waved the green flag, and seven or eight - perhaps close to twelve or thirteen - short-clothed villagers began to stretch out their hands and push this car, which was full of twenty-six passengers, inch by inch, forward. For a time, the sound of "xie xu" was like being on Shanyin Road.</p>
<p>If it were always like this, traveling on land like a boat, it would be safe. Unfortunately, after pushing about a hundred steps, the front of the car actually rattled and smoked for a while before driving away. Yellow sand rolled behind the car, and white smoke billowed in front of the car. This road was probably built too well, so God secretly circled it. As soon as the car sped up, there was also a kind of stomach-strengthening and spleen-invigorating movement. Hongye's straw hat bumped into the nails on the roof twice, and the accumulated momentum was completely lost.</p>
<p>The car traveled for one hour and forty minutes, and C Township was in sight! Green mountains; precarious city walls; stacked neatly and beautifully, wine jars like small mountains; stone archways built by imperial decree, one by one; these are all characteristics of C Township. Particularly lovely are these wine jar mountains. Each one is round and smooth, arranged like bright pagodas. Hongye had always admired the wine merchants of C Township, who had such amazing skills, and wanted to have the opportunity to see them stack them one by one with his own eyes, but he had never encountered it.</p>
<p>From the bus station to Hongye's home, you still have to take a rickshaw for thirty minutes. In the car, Hongye suddenly felt an inexplicable chill. The closer he got to home, the more flustered he felt. The attack of the storm seemed to be right in front of his eyes. It wasn't until he saw the black-painted wall of the gate in the distance, with the gray wall written with "Tearing Down Posters," and there were no unusual signs, that his heart was only half settled.

<p>Women's Paradise</p>
<h3 id="e189">Miss An <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hui Zhu</p>
<p>That Miss An makes me feel uncomfortable when I see her, do you know why?</p>
<p>I remember once, I agreed to go out for lunch with her on Thursday. When that day came, she ran to my house after twelve o'clock, opened my drawer, opened my handbag at will, took out a tube of lipstick, and applied it carefully in front of the mirror. My family was already having dinner there, and I went back first because I was going to accompany her out for lunch.</p>
<p>After a while, she applied lipstick and powder, and smiled at me, "Oh, sister, I'm sorry, I'm going to the city to see my mother, but I can't accompany you to lunch. You don't mind, right?" She would say some apologetic words.</p>
<p>This kind of situation has happened many times.</p>
<p>But she herself often likes to suggest going to dinner together, and at the same time, she shouldn't bring others with her, like going to cafes or watching movies, it's all like this.</p>
<p>"Why did you go with Miss Qiong? Leave her quickly. Don't you like the movie starring Hu Die? Let me accompany you." She said possessively.</p>
<p>If you are doing very busy things one night, she will come and talk about some things, saying that she feels that she has been living a very boring life these days, and she has also scheduled ten days in advance, and this Wednesday night, she invited me to her house for dinner.</p>
<p>I was waiting for this day. Mr. Ma asked me to go dancing, and I refused. Miss Lin asked me to go to the movies, and I didn't go. I packed everything up. By then, the clock had chimed seven o'clock. She really came. As soon as she entered the door, she said, "Dinner will have to be rescheduled. Let's reschedule it for tomorrow, because I have another appointment with Miss Pan today."</p>
<p>She also has more things that make people uncomfortable. For example, when the agreed day comes, she comes with others and says, "I'm going with Mrs. He, so you don't have to go. Don't mind." How uncomfortable are these words to hear?</p>
<p>Once, I went to Sincere Department Store to buy something and stopped by to see her. She didn't say anything to me. After I bought my things and went home, she ran to my house to see me, but said that her mother wanted to buy a sanitary shirt, and she didn't have time to accompany her, so she had to have me accompany her. Like this Miss An, she really doesn't understand the principles of social interaction at all. Of course, there are many people like Miss An in this society!</p>
<h3 id="e190">Aesthetics of the House <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>I often go to my friends' homes to observe. Some of them are decorated very exquisitely, and everything can arouse people's interest. Of course, exquisite decorations require a lot of money. Many people have economic difficulties and cannot afford it, but no matter how simple it is, cleaning up is the first priority, because a well-decorated room can arouse people's interest in staying at home. A messy home can often make the husband unable to sit still at home. Here is a picture of the layout of a house, and everything is very simple. This is almost what everyone can afford. Therefore, the beauty of the house does not necessarily have to be very luxurious to be well decorated. Simple and clean also have a kind of aesthetic interest. I think this issue is what the housewives of every family should study.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Gold Market Echoes: Financial Ancient Well Sends Downward Waves <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Optimistic Outlook for World Economic Conference</p>
<p>Currency Market Repeatedly Shows Bullish Strength, Shocking the Market</p>
<p>Central Bank's Cash Offering is Small, Maintaining Weakness</p>
<p>(Decline Not Weak, 6.3 Taels) According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's near-term silver bar slightly contracted by 0.0625, the long-term remained unchanged, exchange rates rose slightly, the US dollar exchange rate and private telegraphs were unchanged. Although long-term silver bars fell, the decline was small, as was the case with US cotton. Stocks, however, showed a slight increase. Local banks quoted the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625 and the US dollar at 28 yuan 0.0625, both at par with the previous closing price. Although standard gold opened slightly lower by a few cents, the market situation was still stable. The morning opening was 796 taels and 8 mace. Heng Yu sold, falling more than 2 taels, but there was still a struggle. Afterwards, the currency market loosened sharply. Heng Yu and Da De Cheng repeatedly sold. There were not many transactions in the market, but the downward trend became more and more intense. In addition, US dollars for April in the currency market could not be sold, plummeting to around 6 taels, reaching 790 taels. Buyers were slightly seen in the market. Major players such as Heng Xing, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng, and Yong slightly purchased bars, up to 791 taels and 8 mace. Although there was another downward trend afterwards, there were some twists and turns. The US dollar for April in the currency market had already been traded at half a yuan, a sharp drop of 1.875/10 compared to the opening. It once broke 90 taels, reaching 788 taels and 3 mace, then turned calm. Banks also had a good appetite. The gold industry did not see a blockage. In addition, the Central Bank's cash opening gradually improved to 91 taels, but the amount was not large, preventing further rise. Thus, it hovered within 1 tael for quite a long time. Finally, Heng Xing suddenly intended to sell, once dropping repeatedly to 89 taels and a half, but buyers were still enthusiastic. It was then seen hovering around 90 taels. The final noon closing was 789 taels and 9 mace. The afternoon opening was 789 taels and 8 mace, then 9 taels and 3 mace. Buyers were slightly active. In addition, the currency market remained unchanged. It broke through 90 taels, once reaching 91 taels and 1 mace. The market suddenly became boring again. Banks were also tired, looking bleak all around. It hovered for a long time, closing early at 790 taels and 0.9 mace. It was observed that after opening, it immediately fell. Although it was said that the currency market loosened sharply, upon investigation, there was a reason. Major players such as Fu Chang could not maintain their bullish position. Seeing that people's hearts were trending downward, they immediately sold off (Heng Yu replacing them). Although the World Economic Conference has not yet opened, general expectations seem to be vigorous. In addition, the currency and gold markets opened and sold, and the market situation loosened, resulting in a tragic fall. The price of pure gold continued to be small. Swaps also fell along with it. The spot price discount has been reduced to 7 cents. The source of spot goods is still strong. People's hearts are withering, and transactions are limited. Although the Central Bank came to open cash, the amount was extremely small, making it difficult to reverse the tide. Now, the day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Stepping Backwards into the 90 Taels) The morning opening was 796 taels and 8 mace, a drop of 4 mace from the previous closing price. This was because Heng Yu, on behalf of the bullish Fu Chang, came to sell, and Da Xing Yong came to buy 105 bars, which was the opening price. However, after Da Xing Yong left, retail investors in the market scrambled to sell. Da De Cheng also came to sell bars, falling to 95 taels. Afterwards, goods were occasionally brought in at between 5 and 5.5 taels, but it was not very effective. Gan Chang Xiang Sheng Da slightly absorbed, at 5.8 taels. Zhi Feng Yong Gan Chang Xiang suddenly sold, but the amount was not large. Although the limit price reached 5 taels, there was no major change. This was because the HSBC exchange rate for both British and US currencies did not change. When 125 of the current month's shillings were sold by Citibank, those in the market such as Yuan Heng Run Chang Yu came to sell, retreating to within 5 taels. Ying Feng Heng then bought, still counting 5 taels. Pan Gen sold February's US dollars for 25, which was already harder than the initial opening by 125. Heng Yu continued to sell, at around 4 taels, and there was a slight hover. US dollars for April were traded at 4.375, and no one cared about them. Zhao Feng Chang also sold, and Da De Cheng was especially aggressive in selling, plummeting by 3 taels, reaching 790 taels. Heng Xing came to buy, at 0.07 taels. Fu Yu also bought up to more than 1 tael. Zhi Feng Yong Ying Feng Heng Yuan Mao Yong came to buy bars, reaching 91 taels and 8 mace. However, the trend was still downstream. Da De Cheng Yuan Chun Chun Yuan Yong, etc., continued to sell. Although banks bought US dollars for April at 28 yuan and a half, they had already hardened by more than 1.875. Thus, it broke through 90 taels, reaching 9 taels and 2 mace. Da Xing Yong Wan Xing came to buy, returning to 90 taels and 0.9 mace. Goods were being sold. Wan Xing Yong Feng were buyers, supporting above 90 taels. Soon, Heng Yu came to sell bars again. People's hearts were originally timid, so the price could not be supported, falling to 88 taels and 3 mace. Wan Xing Yuan Mao Yong bought up to around 90 taels. Tong Feng Heng, on behalf of the Central Bank, continuously opened cash twice, with extremely small amounts, totaling 70 bars. The price was 91 taels, rising to 1 tael. Heng Xing suddenly came to sell, still within 0.05 taels. Tian Feng Yong bought bars, although it rose by a few cents, Heng Xing limited the price and sold bars, and retail investors aggressively pressed the price, reaching 89 taels and a half again. Finally, Tian Feng Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc., still bought slightly, closing at 789 taels and 9 mace. Goods were auctioned at 90 taels and 0.2 mace.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Filled with Boredom. The afternoon opening was slightly lower by 1 mace, at 789 taels and 8 mace. Goods were being offered (goods opening at 9 taels and 5 mace), reaching 9 taels and 3 mace. Zhi Feng Yong Tian Feng Yong bought bars, hovering to above 90 taels. Retail investors raised prices, and Tian Feng Yong urgently sought bars, rising to 91 taels and 1 mace. Da De Cheng continued to sell. Yuan Chun, etc., slightly purchased, causing a great deal of hovering. This was because the currency market was deserted, and the gold market also had few transactions. It hovered within 1 tael for a long time. When Da Feng Heng Wan Xing Gan Chang Xiang came to buy small amounts, there was a slight improvement. However, Heng Xing sold again, retreating to 0.03 taels. After this, there were only a few cents of hovering. The number of people in the market gradually decreased, making transactions difficult. Although Wan Xing continued to buy small amounts, the price was raised to 91 taels. Human transactions disappeared, and a sense of boredom reappeared. It dragged on for a long time, closing early at 790 taels and 0.9 mace. It was observed that the highest price of the day was 796 taels and 8 mace, and the lowest price was 788 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 8 taels and 5 mace. After opening, it immediately fell. The result of a bleak day was that it fell by 6 taels and 3 mace compared to the previous closing price. It can truly be said that the ancient well has revived its waves.</p>
<p>(Quoted Prices Mostly Suppressed, 6 Taels Strong) The quoted price did not change because the HSBC exchange rate for the US dollar did not move, still at 27 yuan and 75 cents, resulting in a combined gold price of 864 taels, 8 mace, and 6 fen. According to the closing price, the discount was more than 73 taels, more than 6 taels more than the previous closing price. The ledger prices for January and February were the same at 792 taels, March at 790 taels, morning make-up water at 790 taels, and afternoon at 791 taels.</p>
<p>(Each Firm's Transactions are Always Small) On the surface, the overall transactions were that Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Gan Chang Xiang, Fu, Zhi Feng Yong Chun, Yuan Yong Yuan Heng, Heng Xing, etc., all sold. A large number of Da, Yong, Heng, Wan Xing, Zhao Feng Chang, Yong Feng Yuan Chun, Tong Feng Heng, Tian Feng Yong, etc., bought. Major players such as Fu Chang and Rui Xing all had a tendency to sell off. A certain speculator also sold slightly. Da Lian's Wan Xing bought. Transactions were not smooth. Except for Heng Xing, Guang Bang pressed out more than 200, Sheng Da Yi Feng were not excited.</p>
<p>(Pure Gold is Stagnant and Weary, Transactions are Limited) The pure gold market was calm yesterday, and the trend was also dull. The opening yesterday was calculated at 10 taels and 0.05 yuan. Silver shops sold goods, and Ying Feng Heng bought in the market. Transactions were estimated at more than 200 taels. No other transactions were heard of.</p>
<p>(Swap Discount Reduced to 7 Cents) There were not many swaps made in the market yesterday. The price for February to March was seen to fall yesterday. There were not many positions, and the source of goods at each spot firm was abundant. The discount continued to decrease to 7 cents, which was done by spot firms Gan Chang Xiang and Ying Feng Heng. Ying Feng Heng posted, with a total of 35 bars traded. In the afternoon, Gan Chang Xiang continued to post 7 cents, which was posted by Yuan Xin Yong, totaling 105 bars. In addition, Heng Yu generally posted at more than 1 tael, and Tong Feng Heng, etc., had positions at around 1 tael.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Gold Industry Aggressively Sells, British and American Exchange Rates Loosen Drastically <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>| Although Banks Were Buying In, They Ultimately Could Not Resist the Urgency of the Situation |</p>
<p>Yesterday's currency exchange opened extremely flat. This was because foreign dispatches reported that London's near-term silver bar had slightly contracted by 0.0625, the long-term was unmoved, the New York silver price was still unchanged, and although the exchange rate rose slightly, the long-term silver price on the gold and silver exchange slightly fell. American cotton was also slightly higher at two pounds. The exchange rate was small, but stocks did rise slightly, resulting in a balanced situation. The near-term British exchange rate opened at 1 shilling and 8 pence 0.0625, and the US dollar at 28 yuan and 0.0625. After opening, a hard trend appeared immediately. This was because the gold industry aggressively sold off. Although banks were buying in, they could not resist the urgency of the situation. The HSBC exchange rate for both British and American currencies did not change. However, the gold industry continued to sell standard gold, also due to the closing of long positions, resulting in a sharp downstream trend. The trend became increasingly hard. Sassoon also came to sell. The US dollar continuously loosened more than 1.875. The Mitsui firm, from Japan, bought in. Banque de l'Indochine also bought more than it sold. Citibank sold slightly. The afternoon was extremely calm, and there were few transactions. Banque de l'Indochine and Mobil bought in. Mitsui and Anda, etc., sold slightly. Mobil had settlements. Sassoon sold in the morning and bought slightly in the afternoon. Throughout the day, except for the stable afternoon, the morning had a review of 125 (British exchange) and 1875 (US exchange). After opening, it immediately hardened, without looking back. The trend was uncertain. In the end, the British exchange hardened by about 125 compared to the previous closing, and the US dollar hardened by 1875. Now, the banks' buying and selling in the morning and afternoon markets are recorded below.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The near-term morning opening was priced at 1 shilling and 8 pence 0.0625, at par with the previous week's closing price.

There were not many transactions. Extending to the noon closing, the offering price was 1 shilling and 8 pence 1.875 up to 25. The afternoon was even quieter. Only Anda sold April's 25 to Sassoon, and no other transactions were heard. After the human market, the gold market closed early, and the British exchange also extended without transactions. The closing price was 1 shilling and 8 pence 1.875 for January, with a buying price of 25. The same price for February. 1 shilling and 8 pence 25 for March, with a buying price of 3125.

Mitsui bought April's half yuan, all sold by Sassoon. Banque de l'Indochine bought February's 3125 from Ho Feng. Mitsui and Banque de l'Indochine continued to buy April's half yuan.

Extending to the closing, the offering price was 28 yuan 25 for January, 3125 for February, 375 for March, and 4375 for April. The buying price was increased by 0.0625.

<p>Jiangnan Copper Coins Plummet, Guangdong Copper Coins Slightly Decline</p>
<p>Copper Coins are Released Continuously and Extensively</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks opened on Monday, and the complexity of sorting out the year-end procedures goes without saying. In the market, foreign exchange was very busy and smooth due to securities deliveries, with banks buying cheap on a large scale, but the price was still not good. This shows that the intention of the buying and selling was not for formal sales. As for auxiliary coins, since there is currently a large source of supply, the market price has fallen uniformly.</p>
<p>(After Falling, Foreign Copper Coins Rise Again) The "foreign copper coin" price was 7 qian, 1 fen, 2 li, 6 hao, 2 hu and a half in the early market, and 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 1 hao, 2 hu and a half in the afternoon market. Although the result was only 1 hao and 2 hu and a half higher than the early morning, the difference between them had exceeded 1 li. The "silver discount" prices for both the morning and afternoon markets opened at 2 fen, and there was no added water, still a white spread.</p>
<p>(Prices of All Auxiliary Coins Fell) The Jiangnan small foreign coins suddenly plummeted in the early market, calculated at 6 qian and 2 fen, a sharp drop of 4 li and a half from the previous morning. The afternoon market continued to fall by 8 li, only 6 qian, 1 fen, and 2 li. The volume of transactions was 21,000 jiao in the early market and 12,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian, 0 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao and a half in the early market, and 6 qian, 0 fen, and 3 li in the afternoon market. The volume of transactions was 135,000 jiao in the early market and 100,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were again released, with 4,500 wen for 386,000 wen. There were also many transactions, totaling more than 44,000.</p>
<p>(Silver Dollar Influx and Outflux Busy) The type of silver dollar settlement and transaction, due to excessive inflows and outflows, and the market time was particularly extended, so it was not possible to make a detailed report as usual. Approximately the amount of funds settled by the banks totaled no less than 50 to 60 million, while the amount of public notes settled by money houses and banks was 40 to 50 million, and the amount of settlement of public notes also reached about 20 million. The bank withdrew 1.6 million from the warehouse, and the bank fined 2 to 3 million. The volume of opening exchange drafts in the market was 2.55 million in the early market and 1.966 million in the afternoon market. The volume of banknotes was 135,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of off-market banknotes was 200,500 in the early market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of transaction of bank checks was 60,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume of small silver shops was 700,000 to 800,000, and the source was more than 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Silver and Money Industry at the End of the Lunar Year <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Unlimited Ticket Collection Time</p>
<p>Influx of Supply Causes Auxiliary Coins to Plummet</p>
<p>The silver and money industry usually extends the ticket collection time gradually during the final closing of the lunar year, starting ten days in advance. The closing time, which is usually 2 pm, is first extended to 3 pm, then to 4 or 5 pm. In the last few days, the deadline is extended without time limit. In recent days, the ticket collection time has been extended, and all procedures have been delayed. It is necessary to work until midnight at the earliest to complete the procedures each day. This year, there is a new phenomenon, different from the previous year, which is the auxiliary coins. In the past, the market prices of various auxiliary coins would soar at the end of the year. This year, however, on days such as yesterday and the day before, they plummeted instead. The reason is that various ports knew that auxiliary coins in Shanghai would soar at the end of the year, so they transported them to Shanghai one after another in advance to facilitate circulation. At that time, they were hoarded by small money houses, so the prices did not loosen. As of yesterday, the influx of supply made it difficult to maintain, and they also sought to sell them one after another. As a result, the prices plummeted from both sides.</p>

<p>Feng Yang Firm reported that the New York stock market on Saturday (the 21st) remained quiet. The prices of various stocks were also very stable. Affected by the strength of the US and German government bonds, the former was due to the meeting between Hoover and the latter was due to the strong London German government bonds. The half-day transaction volume was only 366,000 shares. Looking at the current situation of the stock market, it is difficult to have major developments in the shortest period of time. For investment interests, it is better to buy strong and sell weak. The following are the prices between 10 yuan and 20 yuan and are very suitable for investment: American Water and Power, Waste, Canada Railway, Corinthian Southern Railway, Bowman Match, Fourth National Investment, General Railway Marking, , National Power, Pennsylvania Railway, Third National Investment, United Gas Improvement Company.

<p>Self-Delivery: 5,250 Bales</p>
<p>The on-market price of standard yarn in January on August 1 was 147 taels and 6 mace. Later, it rose with the price of US cotton to 157 or 158 taels. In addition, Cantonese merchants had a good sale in the summer, and the market was quite high. However, the second estimate of US cotton plummeted by more than 100 pounds. The entire yarn market was broken by it. Since then, the standard yarn has been in a slump, and the price of US cotton has reached 5.7 cents. Sales to customers in the autumn were disappointing. Farmers in the countryside had tight economies due to the low price of rice. As a result, yarn sales were sluggish. The lowest price in mid-December was 139 taels and 3 mace. At the end of the year, the war in Sichuan was over, and there were some forward and spot purchases. The market turned up, and the highest price was again 146 taels and 3 mace. However, during the New Year holiday, the Japanese army fiercely attacked Yuguan, and the situation in Pingjin was tight, suddenly falling to 42 taels and 1 mace. However, many financial institutions took delivery and hedged. The final price was 143 taels and 1 mace. As a result, the total delivery volume was 7,150 bales. 5,250 bales were delivered by themselves, and 1,900 bales were actually delivered.

<p>The on-market price of Zheng Standard Cotton in January on August 1 was 31 taels and 8 mace. It rose with the price of US cotton to more than 9 cents, causing people to get excited. The highest price of standard cotton reached more than 31 taels. However, the second estimate report of US cotton increased sharply, plummeting by more than 100 pounds, causing a certain factory to sell off a large amount, amounting to more than 200,000 dan. Therefore, in November, the lowest price was 30 taels and 2 mace. After the domestic cotton production took a turn for the worse in the autumn, the output decreased, and the sources were lacking. The price of gold also reached a new peak of more than 830 taels. Speculators also had rumors of short squeezes. The market rose to 33 taels and 5 mace and a half. A certain manufacturer searched for a large amount of coarse velvet cotton in Tianjin and brought it to Shanghai for delivery, which suppressed the market slightly, falling back to 32 taels and 5 mace and a half. As a result, the total delivery volume was 25,200 dan, and the actual amount was 13,800 dan. The rest was delivered by themselves. The delivery price was 33 taels. The goods were all 13,800 dan of Tianjin coarse velvet cotton. The receiving parties were half factories and half firms. The delivering signal was Chang.

<p>(Cotton Yarn) The cotton yarn market is still calm. There are 200 bales of Sichuan, 145 bales of Yunnan, 15 bales of Shantou, and 5 bales of Xiamen, totaling 365 bales. The market is similar to the previous day. The standard cotton yarn market will hold the monthly futures delivery. It will be closed for 5 days from tomorrow and will reopen as usual on January 30. The future situation of the yarn market must be shifted according to the situation and customer sales.</p>
<p>(Cotton) The cotton market has softened due to the slight fall in foreign cotton, and the factories have stopped work for a few days at the end of the year, so they have temporarily stopped purchasing raw materials.</p>

<p>(Bombay) Last week, although the market situation was firm due to the US House of Representatives accepting the rural relief bill, the situation here remained quiet. Export inquiries were scarce, and arrivals gradually increased. In terms of futures, there was not much short covering, and there was a certain amount of selling, so even with strong American cotton, it was difficult to maintain market prices. Local factories, except for urgent needs, had no intention of buying raw cotton. The following is a statistical appendix for the past week (in units of thousands of bales):</p>

<p>(Liverpool) Last week's spot market was flat, and New York news was insignificant. Speculators were waiting for opportunities, and business was not large, but the market was still firm. New cotton was being purchased, and hedges were absorbed by the trade. Egyptian cotton was dull due to the possibility of increased import duties in the US.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of goods at Zhabei Hai was already scarce. More than twenty firms remained in the river storage. Market transactions were minimal because the shops had already closed. The white rice market showed a slight retail decline, and the remaining goods also showed weakness. There will be no market report tomorrow.</p>

<p>(Sugar Market) New York, 21st: Spot sugar remains at 6.875 cents, and the market is stable. Futures for January also remain at 7 cents, and subsequent months are mostly one pound higher. March is at 6.9 cents, May at 7.03 cents, July at 7.07 cents, September at 8.01 cents, and December at 8.05 cents. Also, London reports that March is up 25 to 5 shillings. May remains at 5/1.75. August is up 25 to 5/4.25. Java white sugar remains at 7 shillings 9 pence.</p>
<p>The New York sugar market was very weak last week. Total transactions for the week included 186,000 bags of Philippine sugar and 72,000 bags of Puerto Rican sugar. Before the end of the Roosevelt administration, the uncertainty regarding necessary tax rate changes and the recent actions regarding the new Cuban harvest have further increased the supply of Philippine sugar. Although the upward trend in the sugar market has now passed, the hope for better conditions is gradually improving. The supply position of the sugar market in the world seems to be seeing a stable reversal. The decline in refined sugar prices does not lead to increased demand. Best granulated sugar is at 3.90 cents per pound, compared to 3.95 cents last week.</p>

<p>As the end of the lunar year approaches, workers in inland silk factories must stop work for the New Year. In addition, with the account settlement period approaching, silk factories have temporarily halted the purchase of rayon raw materials, so customer sales have decreased. Yesterday, only the Sichuan merchants, due to the end of the war in Sichuan Province, needed raw materials and replenished seventeen boxes of Grade B Italian-German rayon for January and February at the guild. Prices did not fluctuate much due to the stabilization of exchange rates.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's because tonight's food wasn't very appetizing, or because he wasn't in a good mood. After eating two bowls of rice soaked in water, he threw his chopsticks on the table, pushed the bowl to the edge of the table, and said, "I'm not eating anymore!"</p>
<p>Today is January 6, 1933. The sky is gloomy, and moldy water drips from the eaves all day long. Sitting at home is a bit depressing. In addition, it's the first month of the year, and the newspaper workers have also stopped working. We are practically isolated from the world as if locked in a desolate temple. But today, news arrived that Shanhaiguan has fallen, and Tianjin is also in danger. This is truly both laughable and infuriating. The non-resistance general is going to resist to the very end, right? The long-term resistance government is going to sing the tune of long-term resistance for a long time, right? Since Shanhaiguan has been occupied, can Tianjin still be relied upon? Can Beijing still be relied upon? After North China falls, can Nanjing still struggle? Ah, we are becoming slaves to a foreign country! Ah, another national crisis has arrived!</p>
<p>What use is our shouting? What road can we take? Thinking of these difficult problems to solve, I feel a bit like laughing and crying at the same time.</p>
<p>"Another period of national crisis?"</p>
<p>During dinner, none of us spoke. But when he threw his chopsticks on the table and said he wasn't eating anymore, our conversation gradually turned back to the same topic.</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked. "Do you want to fast?"</p>
<p>"Reduce food. Reduce food to save the country!"</p>
<p>"Didn't Wang ×× fast last time? He became famous overnight."</p>
<p>"Ha!"</p>
<p>"It's really interesting. Who cares if you starve to death!"</p>
<p>"Actually, he was still eating. When the students from Beiping came to Nanjing, he was still eating on the train!"</p>
<p>"That's a good method. It's not worth it to really starve to death for this kind of thing! However, it's an appropriate time to show off."</p>
<p>"You could do it too. A special dispatch from Shanghai could immediately report that Professor So-and-so of So-and-so University, grieving the loss of Yuguan and lamenting the daily decline of the nation, has begun a fast from today and urgently urges the authorities to send troops to resist..."</p>
<p>"It's really worth trying!"</p>
<p>"And news reporters will immediately come to interview you."</p>
<p>"Someone will immediately come to write about your daily life. Ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"News reporters can also interview your wife," Old Chen said, laughing.</p>
<p>"At that time, you can hide to avoid trouble and refuse to meet," I said, also laughing. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e218">Japan's Shift from Rule of Law to Rule of Force <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The Japanese political arena has always been a fighting arena for warlords. Before the Meiji Restoration, among the dictatorial so-called shoguns and regents, which one was not a violent warlord? For 2,500 years, except for a few outstanding talents like Empress Jingu and Prince Shotoku, who used the imperial throne to make some suggestions, has the Japanese imperial family, which they boast as being unbroken for myriad generations, ever had any power in politics? A century ago, the sudden arrival of the black ships and the cannons of the red-haired foreigners shattered the dreams of the dwarves. Thus, the unified situation of "revere the emperor and expel the barbarians" and "returning power to the emperor" finally succeeded.</p>
<p>After the Restoration, the ignorant warlords, compelled by the national trend, pressured by world trends, and inspired by the perseverance of the civilian government faction, did not dare to be leaders of the military and destroy this constitutional government, which had been built with much bloodshed, sacrifice, and difficult management. For seventy years, the reason why this small island nation was able to dominate East Asia and act ferociously in the world was all thanks to the spirit of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Now, parliamentary politics is also exhausted, the anxiety arising from the vast gap between rich and poor has expanded, and coupled with the stimulation of new world trends and the incompetence of key figures in the political center, the warlords, who have been hiding their ambitions for a long time, will naturally take this opportunity to rise up and seize power. The rampant assassinations, the activities of the Kokuhonsha, the exposure of the Communist Party, and the dispatch of troops to Southern Manchuria—aren't these all evidence of the warlords seizing power? Japan is at a crossroads, on the eve of shifting from the rule of law to the rule of force. Not only is this clear to us onlookers, but even the old Japanese statesman Yukio Ozaki has stated in London that the warlords will soon practice dictatorship and that Japan's national fortune will soon come to an end. Although I am not a prophet, I believe that Japan will undergo tremendous changes within five years. First, the rampant warlords and the complete destruction of the legal order, followed by the uprising of the oppressed masses and the transformation of the Japanese state and political system. Let us wait and see! The bloody red light will surely shine from this land of the rising sun to the whole world!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Their Sorrows <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>There is a wonderful Chinese saying, I don't know who came up with it, called "a talented scholar matches a beautiful woman." Translated into modern language, it means "a cosmopolitan man matches a modern girl," or, loosely translated, "a handsome guy pairs with a pretty girl," which is almost the same.</p>
<p>We can cite many examples of this "talented scholar matching a beautiful woman" pattern. In the West, there's Dante and Beatrice, Keats and Fanny Brawne, Rossetti and Siddal, Shelley and Mary, Galsworthy and Ada. In the East, there's Bai Juyi and Fan Su and Xiao Man, Jiang Baishi and Xiao Hong, Wang Xianzhi and Peach Leaf, Han Yi and Zhangtai Liu...</p>
<p>It's really as Milton said, "Men are the embodiment of strength, while women are made of gentleness and charm." In historical romances, it can almost be said that men sell their talent, while women sell their beauty. Men can be a bit ugly, but women must have an oval face. If a man is both handsome and charming, that's the icing on the cake, but if a woman has talent, it becomes superfluous. Don't those cunning and hypocritical moralists sing the high-pitched tune of "lack of talent in a woman is a virtue"?</p>
<p>In the past, talented women almost always lived in sorrow. This is not fate, but the result of oppression and contempt in society. The beautiful Lady Reigate had star-like men surrounding her. The famous professor Sofia Kovalevskaya lamented, "Why does no one love me? I am superior to most women, but the most ordinary women are loved, while I am not!" We can hear the sighs of these unfortunate, talented women everywhere.</p>
<p>Opening the history of Chinese literature, famous female writers all spent their lives in sorrow. Their works are the crystallization of their sorrows. Our familiar female poet Zhu Shuzhen even titled her poetry collection "Gut-wrenching Collection" and expressed the indignant words, "A woman writing literature is truly a crime, how much more so to sing of the moon and chant of the wind!" This is the typical unfortunate "talented woman" of the East.</p>
<p>The great female lyricist Li Qingzhao's whole life was a sad poem. When we read her famous work "Slow, Slow Tune," the indescribable, unresolvable sorrow, the boundless sadness hidden in her heart, are all left on paper by her genius.</p>
<p>The female poet He Shuangqing, also called "sorrow as the fountain of her life", of the early Qing Dynasty, wrote on a reed leaf to her uncle; "Remembering the night without joy, facing spring with difficulty smiling, the peach blossoms quickly large, the bamboo greens constantly disappointed, how could it not be wished that people would sing of tears!" This kind of scene is truly "can not but resent".</p>
<p>In the West, the English female poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, when she was still a young girl, wrote her own psychology in her novel, saying through the mouth of the female poet in the book, "Ah! Heaven! When a woman sits alone at home on a winter night and hears the praise of the whole country from afar, only you can know this sorrow. There is no kiss on our lips, our eyes are always wet, because no one cares why we weep." If the great poet Robert Browning had not accepted her love, then she would probably not only have written the famous poem "The Cry of the Children," but perhaps also a "The Cry of the Maidens"!</p>
<p>The German female poet Adele Schopenhauer, the sister of the philosopher Schopenhauer, once wrote very proudly in her diary about her own sadness: "Who is more lovable than me? In love, who can find greater happiness than me? But this is over, forever over! I can only stay in my lonely tomb." This sad life fostered her "arrogance and loneliness."</p>
<p>In addition, the Russian female writer Alexandra Kollontai, in her great work "Red Love," wrote about the sorrow of revolutionary women in love. The heroine in the book is probably Kollontai in her youth. The French writer Madame de Staël also lamented that her fame brought her an unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>Of course, outside this circle of "talented scholar matching a beautiful woman," we can still find pairs like "Qin Guan and Su Xiaomei." And in this new era, we can find even more. Isn't the American female poet Edna St. Vincent Millay living her life of love? This Miss So-and-so is a good example.</p>
<p>The times are constantly changing. We firmly believe that the era of "handsome guys and pretty girls" must pass, and the era of "great men and healthy women" must surely come. The introduction of this new era will surely bring about the day when their sorrows are eliminated.</p>

<p>— Hong Xingchi</p>
<p>The German aircraft Dornier Do X, number thirty-eight, is the world's largest aircraft to date. It has now been completed and has begun flying between Berlin and London.</p>
<p>This aircraft is designed solely for carrying passengers. It has two large cabins in the middle and a smoking room at the tail, as smoking near the engines could be dangerous. There is also a small cabin that can seat two people under the wings, specially designed for passengers who like to see the scenery. The fare is, of course, higher. In total, it can carry thirty-four passengers, plus a helmsman, a co-helmsman, an engineer, two pilots, a radio operator, and a supervisor, for a total of forty-one people.</p>
<p>The entire aircraft has four engines, each with 650 horsepower. Two engines are hidden in each wing. The four fuel tanks are also two on each side. The engine room is like a large ship, with very thorough protection. When flying over the sea, this aircraft has a speed of 115 miles per hour, and 58 miles per hour over land. The aircraft is also equipped with two pairs of large wheels underneath, so it can also drive on the ground. Because the aircraft is too large, it cannot be pushed. When fully loaded with passengers, it weighs a total of 31 tons. The wings are shorter than the fuselage, so when flying in the air, it looks like a short-winged eagle.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"That's the church's outdoor missionary team."</p>
<p>They walked towards the crowd.</p>
<p>"…Saints like brave soldiers, marching forward in battle! The cross is our banner!…"</p>
<p>He clearly understood the meaning of the song they were singing. Because the previous Friday, Cao Shiguang had taken him to the church and he had heard them sing this hymn.</p>
<p>"Ah! Isn't that Pastor Hubbard?"</p>
<p>He saw Pastor Hubbard waving his right hand, conducting his subordinates in singing, while his left hand held a white handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his forehead. His upper and lower lips opened and closed, and his singing was particularly powerful, as loud and high as a bull's bellow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hezi seemed a little shorter. At that moment, she stood on tiptoe, placed her hands on his shoulders, rested her chin on his shoulder, and looked at the preachers. Her right cheek was almost touching his left cheek. He also felt her breath, which smelled similar to Acetylene Gas. At this moment, he felt a great pressure both physically and mentally. He also felt his blood boiling.</p>
<p>He looked more carefully and saw that under Pastor Hubbard's direction, Cao Shiguang and Liao Haifeng were also stretching their necks and singing hymns. Judging by their spirits, they were very tired, but they had to try their best to sing along. He also saw Cao Shiguang yawning.</p>
<p>"Ah, they are really enthusiastic about preaching."</p>
<p>She said to him with a smile. He smelled a smell similar to Acetylene Gas again. He felt that this breath had an exciting, stimulating effect.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha. That person is yawning!"</p>

<h3 id="e223">Another Shot of Morphine <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation seems to be a dying patient, while Japan is like a doctor treating the patient. When a patient is very ill, they are always mentally weak, reluctant to speak, even with eyes closed as if dead, and without smell or sound. The doctor always gives them a shot of morphine at this moment, so that their barely surviving nerves can be energized and have the possibility of excitement. Now, Japan is doing the same to the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The "September 18th Incident" in Shenyang the year before last was like a sudden shot of morphine! The "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai last year was another shot! The recent "Yuguan Incident" on January 3rd, year 22, was another shot! Originally, the national character of our Republic of China can be said to have been on the verge of decline for a long time! To use a morbid analogy, it had simply reached the point where its breath was barely there and there was no cure. Suddenly, it was given a shot of morphine, which awakened its comatose mind and suddenly realized that a great disaster was imminent and that it was in imminent danger! Only then did it think about struggling and shout out a desolate and painful cry of "Resist Japan and Save the Country." Just as it was riding a wave of excitement and shouting vigorously, another shot came in quick succession! As a result, this continuous drug force filled the whole body from the limbs and bones, and all the nerves became more excited and could not be restrained! Therefore, it simply straightened its throat and shouted loudly! However, as time went by, the effect of the drug gradually faded, the shouting gradually decreased, and eventually its strength weakened and its voice became faint, and it would still return to a state of silence. This neighbor, Japan, saw that our nation was still weak and about to return to its previous state of collapse, so it wanted to be kind and gave it another shot! Presumably, our nation will now rely on this rapid and fierce drug force and will get another moment of excitement, shouting very hard, and the lively situation will certainly not be less than before, and its duration, at least to say, should be extended by five minutes!</p>
<p>However, the nature of morphine will eventually fade away; moreover, it is a poisonous substance, and if too many shots are given, there is a danger of harming life! Therefore, relying on morphine to be excited is not the same thing after all!</p>
<p>And finally, I still want to ask a question: Is our Chinese nation really a nation that only knows how to be excited after taking morphine? Is our government really paralyzed to the extreme and still does not know how to be excited after taking morphine?</p>

<p>— Tinggui</p>
<p>Sighing about the rise and fall of events, the jade tower is again full of mountains. A green sword can cut stone, but it is difficult to split the barrier of beauty. The mountains are full of white snow containing the breath of spring, and the cold plums beside the pavilion welcome the crowd to bloom.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhou</p>
<p>What is going on? The Third Detachment telegraphed the day before yesterday, saying that yesterday they could go to the Volunteer Army Support Association to collect bullets, and after receiving them, they would send them immediately. Why haven't they been sent yet today? Could it be that they encountered enemy troops on the road and had an accident? Or did they not receive them?</p>
<p>We are all anxious. Originally, we didn't have many bullets. In order to capture this Luotian Fort, we fought with the enemy for three days and three nights, and we really spent a lot. If the Third Detachment doesn't send the bullets again, won't we lose all our previous efforts?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the enemy didn't rush over, only fired a few sentinel guns. We were lying in the cold trenches, motionless. Sometimes they fired a few shots, but this was just a bluff. In fact, it is best for us not to fire. At this time, our bullets are so precious! The enemy's iron birds come to our positions from time to time to scout and throw grenades. We ignored them. We were afraid that they would know that we had no bullets!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to and longing for the arrival of the Third Detachment's relief as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, in the afternoon, our hope turned into despair!</p>
<p>"Brothers! You have probably all heard that the Third Detachment just telegraphed to say that the Volunteer Army Support Association doesn't have many bullets left and refuses to issue them. If they refuse to issue them, what will we do?" Captain Wu said to us, "Do we want to die? Or do we want to live?"</p>
<p>"We want to live!"</p>
<p>"We want to live!"</p>
<p>"We want to live! There are only two paths: one is to retreat, and the other is!" Captain Wu said,</p>
<p>"Retreat? I will never retreat! We spent three days and three nights to capture this Luotian Fort. How can we lightly give it up?" Lao Cheng said anxiously,</p>
<p>"Yes, we will never give up Luotian Fort! Otherwise, won't all our previous efforts be wasted?"</p>
<p>"There is another path!" Captain Wu continued, "What is it?" It was Lao Cheng's voice again,</p>
<p>"Don't shout, listen. That path is! It is to surrender, surrender to the enemy!"</p>
<p>"What? Surrender?" It was Lao Cheng again,</p>
<p>"If we surrender, everyone will be high-ranking officials! We will all have status!"</p>
<p>"Well! If we surrender to the enemy, without even asking whether we will be officials, aren't we becoming soldiers for the enemy and fighting against our own Third Detachment?" It was Deputy Captain Wu's voice,</p>
<p>"Bang!" With a sound, Captain Wu fell!</p>
<p>"Brothers! When should we kill this kind of traitor if not now! He has been killed by me now! I say, let's use our last few rows of bullets and charge forward! Seize their bullets, okay?" Deputy Captain Wu said loudly,</p>
<p>"Okay! Charge out!" We all fixed bayonets on our rifles,</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Wandering Singer <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xiyin</p>
<p>Two people, one in front and one behind, playing fluent erhus, walked slowly from the east end of the street to the west end. Several children followed behind, enjoying his beautiful voice. The entire street did not have a single person willing to pay them to sing. The two of them, one was an elderly man with white hair and beard, and the other was a thin and tall teenager. Both of them had faces full of wind and frost, and their clothes were ragged and their appearances were extremely haggard. It could be seen that they were people who were busy on the road all year round to live their lonely and tasteless lives. Alas! How noble is art? Driven by life, there is no appropriate time or place to express it, but it wanders in the alleys and streets, seeking a meal. Don't say there are no like-minded people, but they also have to endure people's ridicule, ridiculing him as a fallen person. Alas! The end of art has been determined!</p>
<p>The old man looked around and walked into a small teahouse with the young man, sitting next to a table by the wall. The old man first tuned the erhu, and then began to play and sing: "I am a crazy person, and there is more sorrow after entering the world! I can't stand the chaos of society, and all I see is you pushing me!…" He sang very sadly, and although no one in the room understood his meaning, they listened because the tone of their singing was very pleasant to the ear.</p>
<p>"…What are you doing for? Nothing more than money and status! Confused thoughts and mental fatigue are all caused by these two things! How many ambitious people have been squeezed out and cannot be successful!…" My heart was shaken by his singing, and I also felt the chaos of society, as if there were endless words to say. Suddenly, with a "bang," the string broke. The two of them didn't ask for money, stood up, and walked away with the broken-stringed qin. On the road, they simply sang wildly and unrestrainedly. Few passers-by paid attention to him, thinking that they were engaged in the lowly profession of singing and were not worth paying attention to; and they laughed at them as truly crazy people. Only a few innocent and uninhibited children still followed, almost without touching the ground.</p>

<p>— Zhuxi</p>
<p>The sound of pouring chamber pots in the city broke the silence of the winter morning.</p>
<p>It came from a mansion standing beside the main road.</p>
<p>"Madam, something bad happened!…Young master is gone!" The maid's shout interrupted the snoring in the whole house.</p>
<p>What? Don't…talk nonsense!…Where did he go?…"Mrs. Wang woke up from a sweet dream, and hurriedly sat up, trembling with fright and cold, and asked Zhang Ma, the reporter, who was standing by her bed, anxiously: "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Madam, just now I went to his room to clean up, and saw that the things were thrown in a mess. As for the person, I searched for a long time but couldn't find him!" Zhang Ma answered quickly.</p>
<p>"Go and call the master up, quick!" Mrs. Wang ordered, hurriedly put on a large fur cheongsam, got out of bed, put on her slippers, and ran to Damin's bedroom on the third floor, secretly guessing in her heart: "Could this beast have left just because his father scolded him a few words last night?…Oh! Damin, have you left me?…It's all those harmful schools that have turned a good child like this after reading books for two years. What anti-Japanese association, student union, everything is learned from others like dogs.…I knew earlier that nothing good would come of it,…Alas! Who would listen to a mother's words there? Last night, he even had a fight with his father,…" Mrs. Wang stepped into Damin's room and saw the suitcases and clothes thrown on the ground,…She was sure that her son had left, and began to cry loudly.</p>
<p>"What? Did the beast leave?…Good! I'm unlucky, I raised him," Mr. Wang strode into the room, saying angrily. Behind him stood his beloved concubine and Zhang Ma.</p>
<p>"Is there a letter?…Hmm! Here." Mr. Wang picked up the letter on the table at random, opened it, and read it softly:</p>
<p>Parents: I have nothing to say. Last night, I asked you not to recognize the enemy as your father and sell enemy goods, but I was scolded by you for being talkative, saying that if you don't do this business, how will you eat. Father! I can't believe that people who don't act as Japanese dogs can't survive! Isn't this greed for profit? [The disease of the Chinese people]…Father, mother, good land has been easily given away by scoundrels. Are you still doing business? Are you still living?…Alas! Father! A happy family is built on a complete country! I cannot sit idly by while the lovable volunteer soldiers who are sacrificing themselves to kill the enemy are gradually being killed by the enemy; I do not recognize that the citizens of the great Republic of China will become slaves of a fallen country. I only know that only "resistance" can save China, so I am leaving! I have left my "small self" without hesitation to save my "big self"! Father! Isn't that right? If one more useless me dies, one less respectable volunteer soldier will die! That is also prolonging your fate for a moment!…Haha! Dying on the battlefield is much more glorious than dying on the Bund! The clothes, jewelry, and cash of about 5,000 yuan that I took away are considered my father's "generous donation" to the volunteer soldiers as military expenses! Goodbye! Respectfully,</p>
<p>Wake up quickly! Your son, Damin, farewell.</p>
<p>After reading the letter, Mr. Wang sighed deeply, saw the newspaper on the table, which was full of large-sized lead letters: Yuguan was lost, the League of Nations planned a compromise, the Japanese army attacked Kaifeng Lu, and attacked Chaoyang Nanling. The volunteer army fought hard waiting for reinforcements…</p>
<p>He seemed to be somewhat moved, remorseful, and grief-stricken, occupying his heart. Tears welled up from his eyelashes, he threw the letter, and lay down on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Where did he go?" Mrs. Wang asked, crying.</p>
<p>"Brave Damin! My good son, a good citizen of the country,…He…he joined the volunteer army…to kill Japanese devils!…I…was wrong…I was wrong!" Mr. Wang couldn't help crying out loud.</p>
<p>From then on, the Volunteer Army Support Association added two backbone members [Mr. and Mrs. Wang].</p>
<h3 id="e228">Slave <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Dongxin</p>
<p>"You are simply slaves!" A Chinese teacher often said this to a class of students who made a lot of noise during Chinese class. Indeed, they were too much during Chinese class. The blackboard was covered with many sentences and pictures insulting the teachers, and they made all kinds of strange noises. It was simply not like a class. No wonder the Chinese teacher couldn't help but be angry.</p>
<p>The Chinese teacher was a teacher with profound knowledge of Chinese classics and was loyal and dedicated. He didn't have the bad habits of other teachers, such as asking for leave, arriving late, and leaving early. He spoke loudly and clearly. He had these qualities, so he became one of the best teachers in our school.</p>
<p>"…" The class bell was ringing, and his footsteps had already entered the classroom. After taking attendance, he began to raise his voice, trying to arouse the students' interest in Chinese class. However, the students' carelessness towards Chinese class seemed to be hereditary. No matter which expert who deeply studies education, I am afraid that they can no longer break this bad habit. So the students habitually talked, dozed off, and read novels…</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute, and the sound of students talking also became louder and louder. The teacher really couldn't bear it anymore, so he put down his books and tried to persuade them with sweet words. But the result was not only like playing the lute to a cow, but also won a booing protest.</p>
<p>"If any of you don't want to attend class, please leave…Don't you think about your parents using their hard-earned money to send you to school, hoping that you will achieve something in the future…If you don't want to study, then please ask your parents to donate your tuition to the Northeast Volunteer Army to kill the enemy, so as to avoid…Good baby, give me North China!"</p>
<p>"That teacher spoke more and more angrily. His face was as red as fire, because the students didn't listen to his teachings, and the sounds of ridicule and conversation merged together, and the classroom was like a market.</p>
<p>"You only make trouble in Chinese class. Why aren't you as disciplined as you are in English class?…You are afraid of foreigners and look down on Chinese people. You are not worthy of talking about patriotism, and you are even less worthy of being the masters of China in the future…You are slaves of foreigners…" The students did not sympathize with this teacher at all. I often heard that he was pessimistic about the country's future because of the students' mischief, and even often shed tears of pain.</p>
<p>Class was over, and the teacher had not finished speaking, but the students had already rushed out like a tide.</p>
<p>Next was English class. The classroom was very quiet, and there was not even a sound of coughing. They treated this green-eyed, high-nosed foreigner as if he were sacred and inviolable, respecting him even more than their parents, let alone talking, they didn't even dare to move. Then it was the same dismissal, but the situation was different. The students seemed not to have heard the class.</p>
<p>"Next time prepare twenty pages. Do you all understand?" The foreign teacher stood up and said this. "Yes, sir," the students answered in unison, and then one by one, like an army marching in formation, followed the foreign teacher out of the classroom. I couldn't help but recall the Chinese teacher's words "slave." One hour's work had already been realized before our eyes.</p>

<p>— Hongwei</p>
<p>Although he was old, his heart was still as hot as when he was young. Especially for national affairs, he paid more attention than anything else. He was often indignant and could not control himself when he saw foreign aggression against his country.</p>
<p>One day, he learned that his country had diplomatically broken off relations and officially declared war on a certain country. So he was overjoyed and said to his four sons: "Our country has been subjected to all kinds of aggression by a certain country, and it has been unbearable. Now they have again taken the opportunity to shoot and kill many of our compatriots, violating international conventions and arousing the public anger of the world. And their diplomatic authorities, relying on the military strength of their country's navy and army as backing, do not speak of justice at all. As a result, negotiations broke down and led to war. This war is related to the survival of our country. I am old and can no longer go to the battlefield to serve the country. You are all young and strong, and it is good to contribute to the country and win back sovereignty; I wonder who is willing to join the army?"…He had not finished speaking, and the four sons had already enthusiastically shouted: "I am willing to go! I am willing to go!" He couldn't help but stroke his beard and smile: "Good brave young men!"</p>
<p>After he sent his sons away, he did not stop inquiring about the news of the war for a single day. A week later, it happened that a friend came from the battlefield and told him: "We won the battle! But one of your sons died." He smiled when he heard this and said: "This is a very good thing!" A few days later, someone else said to him: "We won another battle! But another one of your sons also died." He still happily said: "A very good thing!" Later, his remaining two sons also continued to die in battle. In this way, all four of his sons died. At the same time, a certain country had ceased fighting and asked for peace, voluntarily canceling the unequal treaties previously signed and returning the land previously occupied. He heard that none of his four sons survived, and of course he couldn't help but shed a few tears; but knowing that the result of the war was a victory thanks to the efforts of the country's strong men, he couldn't help but dance and clap his hands. On the day when the army was parading in formation, the old man also waved the bright and splendid, respectable and lovely flag of the Republic of China, which fluttered in the wind, barely lifted his dry and parched throat, and echoed in the midst of the ten-mile-long cheers of thousands of people singing the triumphant song of raising our national prestige, wiping out our national shame, overthrowing imperialism, canceling unequal treaties, and fighting for freedom, equality, and independence.</p>

<p>Editor: Opening the newspaper, we often see words such as "snobbish clerks" and "arrogant clerks" that catch our eyes; we have never seen articles of the "unreasonable customers" type. The editor is inevitably suspected of "partiality." Perhaps this is confused by the so-called "the customer is always right" saying?</p>
<p>I am a salesperson in a nationally famous Shanghai department store and have been working there for almost three years. I have heard, seen, and personally experienced disputes between clerks and customers. Let's analyze the causes of the disputes. Salespeople certainly have shortcomings in their service, but customers also have the bad habit of having a "bad temper." Almost five or six out of ten of the customers who wear Western suits and leather shoes, the so-called intellectuals, seem to have problems with their vocal cords when they patronize: they whistle "shh shh" in their mouths, and at the same time point to the required goods with one index finger, unwilling to "open their mouths." If we sincerely take the goods they need and ask them how much they want to buy, they always use the number of fingers to indicate the number they need.</p>
<p>I really don't understand, do these friends in Western suits think that they are supreme figures, unwilling to talk to people who do business? Or is it because the salesperson did not take the initiative to serve them, so they whistle "shh shh"? Here we want to declare that we are a store where people are free to browse, and we can never be like the clerks in old-fashioned stores, following the customers.</p>
<p>Our store's business is very developed, and customers are often crowded. Therefore, each salesperson has to serve many customers, and naturally there are times when they cannot handle everything. In terms of service, driven by the facts, we inevitably neglect one thing while attending to another; therefore, it causes misunderstandings among customers who cannot understand others, and they say embarrassing words. "You are too snobbish. Don't think that I don't buy many goods. You treat people slowly. You must know that buying a lot or buying a little, we are all your customers…" Really, the words are strict and the reasons are correct. If people with this snobbish point of view heard it, they should sincerely accept their kind advice, but how can we have this bad idea! Our store rules, "merit and demerit awards and punishments" are not based on the amount of business, and there are no bad habits like "commission" in other stores.</p>
<p>Originally, in this situation, we wanted to explain our unavoidable difficulties and ask customers to forgive us; but with busy business, there is really no possibility to explain to them. Editor, please allow me to use your valuable space to explain! Respectfully, Wang Yanqiu.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The kind of customer described in Mr. Wang's letter certainly has the problem of having a "bad temper"; and according to what we know, customers' rudeness is endless. Mr. Wang has tasted this flavor for a long time, and it is only natural that he expresses his grievances.</p>
<p>We must know that shops seek profit from capital, and clerks sell labor. Thinking from the perspective of division of labor and cooperation, they and any class that is considered noble in the present era are all indispensable members of society. If we can thoroughly understand this meaning, then customers will certainly not have arrogant behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also advise Mr. Wang that if you encounter this kind of customer in the future, it is best to explain if you have the opportunity. Otherwise, you don't have to worry about it, because this is their own personality, and it is not worth having the same understanding as them.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Madame Xia having previously refused Zhongnan's request to accommodate an outside woman and her child, why would she now graciously permit him to marry a prostitute as a concubine? It turns out that when Zhongnan first wanted to take a concubine, he used edicts such as "Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is to have no descendants" to persuade her. She then said, "As long as we both try, I am not barren. If I plant the seed, it will eventually bear fruit. If I am still unproductive after the age of forty, then I will have to let you act freely!"</p>
<p>That Miss Xia Airuo Hua was officially married to Master Xia Zhongnan after Madame Xia held her grand fortieth birthday celebration. Whether the name "Ruo Hua" was actually her elegant name used when advertising herself for hire is impossible to verify now, being so far away in the south. We only know that when she married into the Xia family, she brought a superfluous "oil bottle" daughter with her.</p>
<p>Ruo Hua was not very old—only twenty-seven at the time—but she had already experienced much suffering and had taken a great tumble in the world of love. According to what she told Zhongnan:</p>
<p>"I was originally from a good family. My father was a horse trader in the Zhangjiakou area. Because he encountered bandits on the road, a group of horses were all robbed. He lost his capital and went home, becoming ill with paralysis from anger. Soon after, he and my mother died one after the other. I was reduced to prostitution at the age of ten. At fifteen, I started singing and receiving guests in Jiangnan. At that time, I already understood human affairs and knew that being a prostitute was a lowly thing. I wholeheartedly wanted to find a good man to marry. It wasn't until I was seventeen that I found a young man I liked. I saw that he had a handsome appearance and had no wife, but his family was poor. In my heart, I only wanted to live a hard life as husband and wife, but it would be enough if I could gain spiritual comfort. I resolved to marry him and use my savings to support him in his studies. After a few years, I scraped together some money from other customers and asked him to redeem me. I then married him. After living together for a year, I gave birth to a daughter, and that person's bad habits gradually surfaced. It turned out that he had already married a wife in his hometown. He took my money and secretly gambled outside. He often demanded money from me. If I didn't give it to him, he would scold me and hit me. Later, when he saw that my money was used up, he abandoned me. I had no choice but to fall back into prostitution, traveling thousands of miles to this place to make a living. It's all for this daughter that I suffer! If it weren't for her, I wouldn't want to be in this world anymore! I was fooled by a young man the first time I married. I dare not try again lightly, so I would rather marry you, an old man, as a concubine. But my daughter! I have suffered all kinds of hardships for her! I will always keep her by my side. After I marry into your family, I would rather you mistreat me than mistreat her."</p>

<h3 id="e232">An Overview of "Insulting China" Films <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Han</p>
<p>Expectations for "The Good Earth"</p>
<p>American films involving Chinese people, such as "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" and "Shanghai Express," have already been sentenced to death. There are countless others that I do not need to go over in detail. However, as far as I know, "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" does not contain any humiliation of China in its story. However, in terms of clothing, makeup, and the portrayal of Chinese people's actions, there are always questionable aspects. If it were shown in Shanghai, it would inevitably be criticized by fastidious film critics.</p>
<p>The content of "Son Daughter" has not been studied, so I dare not comment. However, Ramon Novarro is someone in Hollywood who respects the Chinese. He likes to associate with the Chinese. He says that the Chinese are honest, and it is a blessing to associate with them. Therefore, I don't think Ramon will satirize us in this film. Moreover, Ramon even shaved his head and wore a square-topped watermelon hat to star in this film. It seems that we should not be too demanding in terms of humor. Even if Louis Stone wears a queue, didn't everyone wear a queue with a silk ribbon and call themselves a handsome young man twenty years ago? I think Louis Stone played it very well, but I will reserve a judgment until I see the film.</p>
<p>"The Mask of Fu Manchu" can be said to be of the highest degree of degradation in both content and appearance. The story is absurd, and the acting is even more outrageous. I can assert that this film is specifically for Americans who lack knowledge of the world. It is inexplicable why MGM would do this, but it allows us to further recognize the limitations of their knowledge. (I will briefly introduce the story later.) But we cannot blame them too much because the American people are entirely pleasure-seeking. Although they like to travel, they only do so for sightseeing and entertainment, and they do not genuinely bother to investigate customs and practices. All they know about the Chinese are the Chinatowns in New York and San Francisco. They have never come into contact with high-minded Chinese people. The few Chinese they know are only low-level people in laundries or chop suey restaurants. These people generally do not know propriety and do not care about the dignity of the country.</p>
<p>Now there is a person who has been in China for many years who wrote a novel about the lives of Chinese farmers. This book is the best American work of 1932 (?), and won the Pulitzer Prize that year. Her book has been adapted into a stage play that was popular in New York. This writer is Mrs. Pearl Buck. Her husband, J. Lossing Buck, is the head professor of rural economics and social sciences at Jinling University in Nanjing. Mrs. Buck grew up in China and knows a lot. The name of her book is "The Good Earth." While being busy all day, the author has not yet finished reading it, but I feel that the first few pages depict life in northern villages realistically and profoundly (she depicted the fat butler of a large northern family, with a mole on his face and two or three long hairs that he did not shave off, which shows the author's attention to detail). After the stage play was successful, MGM is going to adapt it into a movie (Mrs. Buck called it Electric Shadows). I hear that it is already in preparation. I cannot help but express a deep expectation. As for what happens next, let's wait and see.</p>
<p>Movie Review and Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e233">Puss in Boots｜Carlton <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>This Puss in Boots is the new film at Carlton. The child stars are not the ones we often see. Their performances are very consistent. This film is not ordinary. It is unique in the world of sound films. Perhaps it can be said to be comparable to the silent film "Peter Pan." It is indeed not easy for children to achieve such results in a film.</p>
<p>The plot can be said to be like a long fairy tale novel, and it is not flat. Everywhere, it vividly reveals the "liveliness" of the children. This kind of film changes everyone's taste, and this kind of taste has never been tasted before.</p>
<p>I am not saying how good this film is—it is amazing!—but I feel that even what Jackie Coogan gave us ten years ago, or what Jackie Cooper gives us now, cannot be compared to this film. The reason is that the so-called child prodigy actors in the past played the main role in a film, and adults had to be used as supporting roles. But this time, "Puss in Boots" was filmed by the joint efforts of many children. Of course, the director of this film can also be said to have put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>There is nothing to criticize in terms of photography, lighting, or set design, but the music is truly wonderful. It can make cold fragments compact and lively.</p>
<p>The child stars not only perform extremely well, but the spirit of the dialogue, to put it bluntly, is simply "little adults." The songs they sing and the dances they dance are also interesting to watch. I deeply believe that this film is most welcome to children. Unfortunately, Carlton's film only has two day showings (the night showing is an Italian stage play). Adults who like children or parents who want their children to be lively can find considerable comfort in this film.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Talking About "Humane" Thieves <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Guan</p>
<p>On a cold and rainy winter night, Star Film Company's new film "Humane Thief" was quietly screened at the Central Theatre. Although it was a non-public screening, I got the news and quickly ran to enjoy the "sneak preview."</p>
<p>After the screening, as I walked out of the Central Theatre, I replayed the film I had seen in my mind and felt that the impression was really good. Now I will write some of my opinions here:</p>
<p>(1) Talking about the director: The director of the film is Wang Xianzai. With his talent, there are many clever and subtle expressions in "Humane Thief." In particular, several interpolations can be said to be exceptionally meaningful and flavorful. For example, the contrast between Zhuang Dade and his son reading books in the film, and the encounter between father and son by the ladder, are all subtle and delightful. Several scenes of Zhuang Zhiqin flirting are imitated very freshly. Strictly speaking, the directing technique of this film is somewhat lacking in "depth," but it is still lively and vivid.</p>
<p>(2) Talking about expressions: Zheng Xiaoqiu's identity is suitable, so he does a very good job. Secondly, Xu Xinyuan, this gentleman, his face is indeed somewhat "serious," but a kind of cunning atmosphere is faintly visible. Speaking of female roles, then Zhu Qiuhen is more competent than Yan Yuexian.</p>
<p>(3) On the idea: This film is very powerful in exposing the dark side of society in terms of consciousness. It bravely pierces through and tears apart the paper mask of "benevolence and morality" of a pseudo-moralist, and clearly points out to us who is the "thief" of "humanity"? Who is the scum of society? Such exposure is naturally needed now.</p>
<p>In a word: This is a domestic film worth watching, so I would like to introduce it to you.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Beautiful Women and Famous Horses | New Light <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>Paramount's Wild Horse Mesa is showing on the New Light screen. This film is similar to Chinese martial arts films, but the plot is still worth watching. Although it does not jump out of the scope of American Western life films, it is clearly different from other cowboy life films.</p>
<p>The moral concept in its plot is very rich. First, it shows that the retribution of good and evil is never wrong. Second, it can show that Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life, and it is inhumane to kill even an innocent animal (horse). Third, it is said that the love between men and women and the righteousness of brothers are the right way of human relations.</p>
<p>The performances are very compact. The people in the play can all be realized, especially Randolph Scott, famous for playing martial arts heroes. His horse "Bench" is also very good. Tony (Tom Mix's horse) was injured and cannot work for the screen. Perhaps "Bench" is very promising for the position of "horse star" in the future.</p>
<p>The photography is ordinary. The lighting is mostly outdoor scenes, so there is no artistic merit to speak of. The director is okay, and the dialogue is also very expressive. The interpolation is very appropriate. Only the scenery seems a bit fake, but there are also many real scenes. Large groups of wild horses and vast wilderness are rare in other films.</p>
<p>At first glance, the four characters "Beautiful Women and Famous Horses" will definitely be thought of as a romance film. In fact, love accounts for very little of the film. The "hero worship" doctrine is invisibly latent here.</p>

<p>Mr. E. Gordon Lowder, a member of the Public Concession Film Inspection Committee, has resigned from the Public Works Department because he will soon return to his country. The Director-General of the Public Works Department has sent a letter to Mr. Lowder, thanking him for his enthusiasm for service and expressing his regret for his departure from Shanghai. It is reported that Mr. Lowder was originally an employee of the Inspector General of Customs. In addition to serving as a member of the Film Inspection Committee, he also served as a member of the Library Committee of the Public Works Department for several years.</p>

<p>— Hui Zun</p>
<p>Luckily, after I bought a ticket, the sign "Downstairs is Full" was hung up.</p>
<p>Stepping into the door of the main hall, the noisy sound made me feel a little impatient. Looking at the room again, a courtyard full of people was sitting in the dark. I frowned, searching for an empty seat as if I were about to discover a new continent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I suddenly found an empty seat in the crowd. I immediately thanked the person sitting next to me and squeezed in sideways.</p>
<p>Just as I was happily preparing to sit down, a young and modern lady sitting next to me suddenly stopped me and said, "Oh! There's someone here."</p>
<p>I sullenly squeezed out again.</p>
<p>The second time I found an empty seat, I was also refused. The third time... the fourth time I encountered the same answer. I also got a little angry and prepared to return the ticket and not watch it.</p>
<p>When I turned around, I unintentionally saw that there was still an empty seat next to the lady. My curiosity was aroused, so I stood next to her and waited...</p>
<p>Five minutes passed, and the movie was about to begin. The lady also refused several people, and the seat was indeed still empty. So I boldly walked in again.</p>
<p>Just as the lady was about to speak, I stopped her and said:</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry. When the person for this seat comes, I'll let him have it."</p>
<p>The lady didn't say anything! She just glared at me fiercely.</p>
<p>When The End appeared on the screen and the young lady stood up, I still didn't change my position. I looked at the lady again. She was about to walk out leisurely.</p>

<p>— Huang Zhenxia</p>
<p>(3) The Congress Dances (Dragon Soaring and Phoenix Dancing)</p>
<p>This is another Viennese film, a masterpiece of Wufat's Palace of Art, rich in sound, light, and color. Historical memories and fairy-tale fantasies unfold charmingly with the accompaniment of music. The performance is skilled, and the interpolation is vivid, especially the aftertaste. The historical background is 1814, just after the revolutionary tide of France was violently suppressed, and the autocratic demons of Europe once again appeared in broad daylight. At that time, that deformed child of the French Revolution—Napoleon Bonaparte—had been imprisoned on a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea. His religious-like army that swept across Europe was either buried under the icy rivers of Russia or stained the wilderness of Saxony red. In short, the cry for freedom and equality in France was no longer able to threaten the autocratic demons in the dark of night. Therefore, Vienna, known as the Holy Roman Empire, was singing and dancing, and all nations were coming to pay tribute, reaching its peak for a time. The unfolding of this story takes place around the Vienna Congress at its peak, and takes the glove shop girl, the "Cinderella" type played by Lili Hayworth, as the central figure, gently unfolding a fairy-tale romance. However, just as this little girl was hungrily dreaming of her "charming prince"—Tsar Alexander I—a storm suddenly rose in the Mediterranean Sea, and Napoleon had already raised his sweeping footsteps, re-trampling European soil with the frantic melody of the Marseillaise. Thus, the Vienna Congress quietly closed, and the elegant people dispersed like clouds, returning to their homelands to prepare for the battlefield of Waterloo. And the ending of this story is such a fairy-tale disillusionment. The glove shop girl (played by the genius Lili Hayworth), although she shed a few clear tears after waking up from her dream, soon returned to being a thorough Viennese little woman, lovable, playful, laughing wildly, and singing clearly...</p>
<p>The story is like this, the musical accompaniment has achieved great success, the light is bright in the spring, giving people a feeling of warmth under the sun everywhere. The director is extremely clever, and the actors are all talented. After watching it, one cannot help but develop a dislike for superficial American films.</p>
<p>This is "The Congress Dances," an extremely rare musical comedy.</p>
