<h3>日本外交之分化運動寳　丨日本聯美政策前途與英日蘇日關係丨</h3>
<p>日本自廣田弘榖氏繼内田康哉「焦土外交」之後。高標其所謂「道理外交。」而局勢仍舊殭化蓋事實上不能違反其軍部之旣定政策。自九一八事變以要來。所引起中日間由外交以迄於經濟之極度殭局。縱令政治上能得暫時緩和。將來終難於澈底解决。除此中國問題面外。其對列國所挑動之禍因。亦陸續爆發。十三票對一要之决議。及本年二月國聯四十二對一之表决。即巳有顯著之表示。及至四面碰壁之後。日閥猶不知前事之非。僅承認内田外相在任内政治上執行之錯誤。故遂略變外交詞令。同時暫且放鬆太平洋對美爭覇之一面。欲從外交上另關新途徑。此途徑爲何即所謂「親美排英論」是也。蓋日本之於美國。就目前情勢言之。日本唯一輸出物品中之生絲。百分之九十　頓美國市場。而美棉對東方輸出。亦以日本爲最大。依此論據以發揮親美之說。似乎言之成理。殊不知日美所爭者。不在過去貿易之交換。不在一時外交之週旋。而在將來市場之開拓。與夫現時太平洋上覇權之確定也。現在日本國内盛倡一九三六年之非常時期。極力增加明年度海軍預算至於六萬萬日金以上。則根本敵意未消。前途終多危險。乃一方面運用其外交手腕。減輕日美衝契之激化。一方從側面着手。使英美關係惡化。彼乃得從中取利。可以左右西太平洋之國際政局。</p>
<p>夫英美兩國在民族關係。在政治立場。在經濟利益。似尚有種種歧異。而於海上爭覇與金融投資。互相競爭之局。尤不易覓得眞正妥恊而歸於同一之點。且自本年夏季世界經濟會護不歡而散以後。金鎊與金圓之對立。愈趨尖銳。市場之爭奪因美國收買現金而愈起激動巨大之反感。同時英美關稅戰爭。又將開始。則大西洋上又多一重波瀾矣。然則日本之親美政策。其可以成功歟。借英美之不恊調而排擠英國於東亞市塲之外。亦可以收得成果歟。日。</p>
<p>本外交界名流近所倡之分化政策。斯時是否可收穫分化之效果吾人於此。不能不加以分析。同時更可指出日本此種分化政策在認識上之錯誤。以辨明今日之國際形勢。</p>
<p>第一。日人誤認我中國國民眞意之所在。至謂中國巳海悟抗日之非。則來免爲片面宣傳。蓋我國民對日之主張。自九一八以至於今。迄未改變也。</p>
<p>第二。英美衝突。雖不易　和伹亦决不至於破裂。更不至聽日人之操縱。美國對歐洲對東亞之外交。手腕誠不若日本之靈敏。惟其對於逺東問題。感覺勢難兼顧。並非眞有親日之意圖則係實情。故吾人觀察日本之親美論。恐亦紙上空談而已。</p>
<p>第三。美蘇復交。現成事實。在美蘇兩國集注之點。在乎經濟。而於逺東外交</p>

<h3>日本經濟侵略急進意國亦主一致應付　第一步與蘇俄聯絡德國報紙大發牢騷</h3>

<h3>日本在日内瓦新設總領事館　探聽國聯舉動</h3>

<h3>□淋病斷根的新療法□</h3>
<p>淋菌的難滅己成全球醫界的難題，要把淋菌巢窠醫好方才完全淋菌斷根，究意淋病怎樣的可以算作斷根呢？也是醫師與病家兩方面所渴想的一件事！以醫學上的地位論起來，淋菌的消滅，就作爲淋病的治愈，但是僅僅檢尿的時候，没有淋菌，還不能算數；因爲粘液謨管内的深部，還有淋菌潛伏着，遇着了機會，譬如交接飲酒勞動等，仍然要發作的；必定要證明深部的淋菌確實消滅了，方才可算達到目的，究竟用怎樣的方法，可以證明深部也没有淋菌呢？醫師祗用一種深部殺菌的新藥，就呌「梅濁尅星」！把潛伏的淋菌完全殺盡，行了此法以後，猶檢不出淋菌，並且没有其他可疑的症候時，大約可作爲斷根，經過了三個月半年一年之後，再行同樣的方法，没有淋菌，而且經過良好的時候，就是淋病完全治愈了·還有一句話，就是男人家雖然完全醫治，如不同時醫治他己經被傳染的妻子，這樣的醫治，是没有用的。</p>

<p>（東京）　明年度預算問題、因大角海相與高橋藏相之强硬態度頓生糾紛、高橋藏相仍堅執主張毫不相讓、致現内閣形成二派對立、政局果然瀕於危機、齋藤首相爲打開計、今晨訪問高橋藏相、但藏相依然不改强硬態度、且　言財政當局不能再加考慮、致首相不得巳乃辭出、更於閣議前、在首相官邸、首相與藏相更加三土鐵相、在人鼎足而談、經討論結果、藏相謂不能再讓步、以危吾國財政之基礎云云、堅持第二次查定案、不允讓步、致絶妥恊之途、首相亦祗能任之自然、無能爲力、然預算閣議、雖明日繼續開會、若大角海相與高橋藏相仍固執不讓、則陷於不可收拾、齋藤内閣巳陷於危機、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日定例閣議後、齋藤首相在别室與山本内相與三土鐵相會見、討論陷於危機之預算問題之打開策、結果三土鐵相與後藤農相、更與大角海相荒木陸相會見、傳達首相意見、後雖經熟議、仍未獲結論、乃再與首相交換意見、如是在明日之預算閣議前、一切凖備工作調停運動、恐將均歸無效、因此所可期待者、僅大角海相與高橋葳相或能一致之一線希望耳（一日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　明年度預算第二次查定案、昨日提示各省、而各省復活要求、依然猛烈、昨日之臨時閣議、無何等决定而散、由各閣員間繼續折衝、大藏省態度仍極强硬、以總額二十一億六百萬元爲最後之線、不能再行讓步、然陸軍方面、始終主張計上關於農村楨極對策其他内政問題之追加預算、大角海相雖言諒藏相之苦衷、努力節減、然對於復活要求實現、仍持强硬態度、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　關於預算問題、大藏省對海軍農林兩省被此互不相讓、態度均形强硬、是以齋藤首相對於該案前途甚爲憂慮近搜集各方情報、則知軍部方面之意向、在觀察目下形勢、不欲爲預算案而繼續其糾紛、但欲從速解决、亦非四千萬元不可、財政現狀固堪杞憂、惟盡量節省、則國家亦不至爲此四千萬元而告危殆云云以此緩和藏相之心緒而圖解决、此外當無他途、因此情形、齋藤首相於一日清晨專訪藏相、述及時局嚴重、務望緩和心緒以應付之、藏相乃將財政現狀加以詳細說明、並希望首相抑制閣僚、設法援救財政危機、此爲首相應盡之職責等語、齋藤首相至感困難忿忿然而辭去查預算閣議將延至二日、以避免閣議席上之正面衝突、此次閣議於午前十一時頃閉會後、各閣僚復行討論講求打開難局之策、惟毫無進展、藏相與海農兩相成爲對立形勢、以此政局推移、前途影響甚巨、是日正午荒木陸相與藏相會於他室、亦述及時局之重大性、希望緩和其心境而藏相依然强硬如故、亦求談及讓步之意旨、可見該案仍屬僵局、齋藤首相現與掘切秘書長正討論如何通過難關、其苦心蕉慮、至爲急迫、倘藏相不能稍事緩和、則前途殊難發見光輝、蓋今後之問題當以藏海兩相之態度爲斷也、（一日日聯電）</p>
<h3>後藤否認辭職</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）　駐英美大使平漢在倫敦美人俱樂部所發美國亦有匯兌平凖金之說、頗使此間官塲莫明其意、平漢所謂美國匯兌平凖金者、殆指金融善後社用以採辦新鑛金之五千萬元而言、此間官場謂微與英國平準金相類者、唯此而已、但數量與目的、彼此不同似難相提並論、倫敦金融時報稱、美大使平漢所稱美國基金運用美滿一說、似無事實爲之佐證、大約此頌基金、名目有誤、其所謂基金者、殆係匯兌跌價基金耳、（一日路透電）</p>

<h3>上海國難宣傳團蒙邊西北展覽會開幕　昨日起在市民教館舉行十天　閉幕後即開始二次長途宣傳　丨林主席等題字相贈丨</h3>
<p>蒙邊西北展覽會、自積極籌備以來、因須補添大幅新畫、故遲至昨晨、始正式開放、該展覽會主辦者、爲上海國難宣傳團團長沈千逸·及其團員等七人、連日在民衆教育館佈置、昨已就緒、前往參觀者、絡繹不絶、兹誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>露天展覽</h3>
<p>進門時、有横布大書上海國難宣傳團蒙邊西北展覽會等字樣、該會最足惹人注意者、爲懸於文廟公園各牆壁上之大油畫、大者長數丈、小亦方丈或七八尺不等、均寫蒙邊與長城各處之景象、或爲日人屠殺之慘狀、或爲喚醒國人之寓意畫、多至數十幅、大成門·大成殿·及明倫堂·崇聖祠·等屋外各壁、均殆懸遍、令觀者怵目驚心、</p>
<h3>各地寫生</h3>

<h3>騙法愈出愈奇鉛餅變白銀　被騙者先後三人　兩騙犯各押五月</h3>
<p>住居法租蒲石路四百七十五號門牌之蘇州人趙牛、與毘鄰四百七十五衖二十七號門牌所住之松江人錢惠林、同爲念秧之流、平日專以詐欺是務、而其騙術、則非拾人唾餘、時有發明、最近半載之間、所施展者、大都以鉛餅鎔化爲銀之術、向一般愚民騙取欵項、如住居赫德路南姚地方之丁金康、徐家滙潘家宅居民侯玉香之子候榮生、及天潼路五百四十六弄六十七號之朱志經·等、均因惑於其言、先後喪資、就中以</p>
<h3>侯氏父子</h3>
<p>損失最多、達三百二十五元之鉅、朱則喪失四十五元、丁僅三十金、若輩對丁施術時、先示以狀如定勝羔之鉛餅、謂係生銀、方自洞庭山中掘出、山内類此之銀塊甚夥苟加發掘、俯拾卽是惟需人工費用、故彼等無力開採、倘得、願藝資斧者、當視墊欵之多寡、以定發掘之時期、出產之數量、並爲堅定丁之信心計、取爐燃火、將所謂生銀之鉛塊碎其一角、儲於器中、架於爐火之上、冶而化之、後乃持赴銀肆、估其成分、據云</p>
<h3>確屬純銀</h3>
<p>丁之疑念頓消利心陡動允墊開採之費、摒擋得三十金、悉數給之、而若輩更佯爲示信、卽將鉛餅三枚付丁作質、居心狡猾極矣、至鉛餅一經陶冶、竟變純銀、此中並無神秘作用、端在手術敏捷蓋其袖中袋内預藏小塊生銀若干枚、當鉛餅擊碎投諸器内之際、略展小技、使受騙者稍忽注意、遂以銀塊易鉛塊、完成工作、迨丁事後察破、所受之物、乃鉛而非銀、則騙予早已</p>
<h3>鴻飛冥冥</h3>
<p>除報捕房外、無追償損失之策、唯有徒呼𠳨氣而已、侯氏父子被騙情形、與丁同出一轍、惟朱志經頗似自願人彀、緣朱有餘屋出租、該騙子適過其門、遂入内看屋、朱見彼手持鉛餅、因詢之、騙子覺斯人已墮其計、卽以與丁言者而與之言、且讀此來賃屋、係作鎔銀塲所、並揑造種種利益如何優越之讕言、朱果</p>

<h3>一九五０年的無線電機</h3>
<p>— 一知譯</p>
<p>琴司白克（ＨugoＧernsback）主編美國ＲadioＣrafl，ＳhortＷaveＣraft兩大無線電雜誌，博學多才，頗著名於無線電界·他最近在ＲadioＣraft雜誌上，發表一九五０年的無線電機（ＴheＲadioＳetof1950）一文，雖爲預言，未必可靠·但根據他豐富的經騐與優良的學識而推測，非如一輩空洞泛論者可比·讀此文後，頗鐃興味，故節譯於次，以供我國無線電同志一覽，我們拭目以待之呢？或將有感慨，奮起直追迎頭趕上呢？　譯者註·</p>
<p>在過去數月中，我時常受ＲadioＣraft讀者訊問，吾對於將來無線電機的猜測如何，吾曾作許多預言，有的皆巳言中；在此無線電機實業生意清淡的時候，恐不會驚奇此無線電同志所欲知的將來無線電機怎樣吧·</p>
<p>我信我猜測中的將來無線電機，爲期定不甚逺；但我不信其於明年或在五年之内可以寓目·此機何時可以出見丨最早恐在一九五０年的初次秋哩·</p>
<p>一九五０年的無線電收音機，不是一具微小的，雪茄煙匣式·或袖珍式的·此機至少須有四尺高或此以上·因兼可收無線電影，具有影幕，故必甚大的·</p>
<p>機内的眞空管爲無熱度或無絲極式的·面積很小，恐不較指環爲大·</p>
<p>機座將與今大不相同，零件（變壓器等）爲便於迅速修理計，將不裝固·其裝置法與今裝眞空管仿若，立時可以移去·其塞座則如目今眞空管燈座，或如槍刺形式的，僅需手腕一轉，即能將欲移去的變壓器或電容器等取出·曾聞目今的工程師說接線不曾錦固，則除糟雜聲外餘不能聞·然目今被稱爲無線電機中之靈魂的眞空管，那有一只銲接呢？所以在製造時，若在排列上對各接觸點妥善工作，則决不會有此困難的問題發生·</p>
<p>眞空管自己，牠構造比今更複雜，而效率則更高·那時眞實的檢波管將必已發明·其效率必勝今日，靈敏度必能增强數倍百分數·所以一九五０年的機，不要天線，毋需地線，外來的吵聲及天電擾都可减少·每具機將製有正確的濾波刷丨不是現今所用的濾波器，牠能減除目前所用電力輸入線騷擾聲自百分之九十至百分之九十五·</p>
<p>將來機上的擴聲器，亦與今不同·不用磁石式或電動式的，而用礦石式或電容器式的，或此二式合成的·一九五０年的機，一具機上將有許多的擴聲器，各司其某已定的成音週率之職，以使高低階的音調，能如原音的逼眞·</p>
<p>一九五０年，現今廣播波長帶皆被取消·播音的波長率在二百公尺以下·那時無線電影若巳成功，則今廣播的波長，皆全無用·無線電影廣播波長皆在五十公尺以下，每電台用同一波長同時播送影與聲·此巳在吾編者語上提及，且於一九三二年四月哥倫比亞廣播制的紐約電台巳完成其聲與影的同時廣播·</p>
<p>將來無線電影必大進步·播程遼逺，鏡頭清晰，人影逼眞·各廣播電台必能播送有色無線電影·用一九五０年的機皆能收得·播送機播送黑白二色者爲最廉·好者則能播送紅藍黄的三原色，及由此調配成的各色·</p>
<p>一九五０年的機，皆用全金屬製成·爲避免外電干擾，全機皆用金屬密固，機　後不如目今的開啓，以致灰塵侵入</p>
<h3>電磁整流器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>整流器唯一的使命，是在將交流電變成單向的電流。現在市上常用的整流器，大概以眞空管式的爲最多。另外有一種呌做電液整流器，（ＥlectrolytoＲectifier）因爲佔地較大，携帶又不便利，所以使用就未見普遍。</p>
<p>本文所介紹的整流器，是利用電磁學上「同性相斥異性相吸」的原理而構成的。内容非常簡單，極合小規模試騐之用。如第一圖，Ｍ爲蹄形永久磁鐵，Ｖ爲薄鐵片，當交流電通過線圈Ｃ時，Ｖ因感應而成電磁鐵，則與交流電週率數同。（每一循環Ｃycle，變換南北極一次，如週率爲六十，則一秒鐘内南北極各變換六十次。）假定在某一循環内，上半週Ａ端爲南極，（Ｓ）那麽Ｓ與Ｓ相斥，同時Ｓ即被Ｎ吸往左方，於是Ｓ２電源變壓器，次吸線圈）發生之電流，得在Ｘ處通過。（見第二圖甲）下半週Ａ端變爲北極（Ｎ），那麽Ｎ與Ｎ相斥，Ｎ與Ｓ相吸，因此Ｘ處分開，電流便無從通過。（見第二圖乙）結果，得到的半波單向電流，與二極眞空管所整流者相同。（如圖曲線所示）</p>
<p>第一圖Ｔ爲電鈴變壓器，次級線圈Ｓ１·專供Ｃ線圈電流用。Ｓ２爲五弗打之次級線圈，整流後如充四弗打之Ａ電池，約得二安培左右之電流。</p>
<p>本篇僅作原理之叙述，所述各節，均從簡明。讀者如欲擴充該器之用途丨丨兼充巨量電流之Ａ電，或較高電壓之Ｂ電，祗須將電源變壓加以改造即可，其餘各部份均可不必移動。至於電源變壓器之詳細設計，請參閱本刋第九期及第十期。</p>
<p>此類電磁整流器，市上亦有出售，惟以仇貨居多，購者祈注意之。</p>
<p>附註　整流後所得之直流電壓，在無負荷時，必須較高於電池之本身電壓，始數應用。如Ｂ電池電壓應爲四十五弗打左右。總之，在繞變壓譽次級線圖時，圖數寗多毋少。因電壓如過高，可串聯相當數值之電阻調節之，過小則必須拆下重繞也。</p>
<h3>機械式整流器的製作</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>充電需要大量的直流，除直流發電機而外，市上發售的就是交流變直流的充電器，自製的要算機械式的最合宜了。</p>
<p>ＡＡ是圓形軟鐵條，直徑二十五米厘長一百米厘，用三十號漆包線繞一千圈，每層用蠟紙絶緣。三十號可通過電流·０六七安培，所以用一只３roo歐姆的電阻來限制通過的電流。N是一片有强磁性的鋼條，寛十米厘長約六十米厘，越薄越好。用鐘表的發條過磁性也行。E是鋼條的固定點。C是小螺釘以調節B與D的距離的，D是三角形的鐵塊，固着木板上作接觸之用。F是保險絲。各線照圖接妥之後便可應用了。當交流電流依慮線箭頭在線圈上通過之後，其周圍即有磁塲產生。照右手定律，則A端應爲北極A爲南極。同時因鋼條B接近A之一端爲北極逐爲吸住，故觸着D，於是RSD電路中即有電流通過，其方向照曲線箭頭所指。反之，若交流電由實線箭頭方向進行，則A端發生北極磁性與鋼條B相拒而Ｄ點不接觸，故ＲＳＤ電路中無電流通過。交流電流動方向更換不已，則ＲＳＤ電路中有忽斷忽續之單向電流流動不已，即完成整流作用。所需直流之多少可以Ｒ調節之，如有相當濾波裝置，也可作代Ｂ電或代Ａ電之用。</p>
<h3>簡便電容量測量法</h3>
<p>— 陸清</p>
<p>量電容器之容量，需用精確之電表。但此種電表價格甚貴，普通業餘家多未備；因此自製或容量已遺忘之電容器，每苦無法知其容量而不能配入線路中應用。此處介紹之法，亦不需用電表，所用器具及所需手續均極簡易，頗合業餘家之採用。其線路圖如下。</p>
<p>圖中Ｖ爲三極眞空管，Ｔ爲普通低週率變魘器，Ｐ爲其初級，Ｓ爲其次級，Ａ電照規定值，Ｂ電可以隨意，Ｒ１Ｒ２爲一耗阻線繞製之電位器之二部份，Ｃ１爲己知容量之電容器，Ｈ爲聽筒，Ｃ２爲需測量之電容器。</p>
<p>測量時先調節電位器，使聽筒中不聞聲息。此電阻及電容量成Ｃ１×Ｒ１－２ＸＲ２之關係。因Ｒ１Ｒ２及Ｃ１爲己知數，故Ｃ２之容量可以Ｃ２＝（Ｃ１×Ｒ１）÷Ｒ２之公式直接算出。</p>
<p>上法如用六百歐姆之電位器及二千歐姆之聽筒，以測量容量小於·００五ＭＦ之電容器，則測得之數，並不十分準確。但若改用更靈敏之聽筒及阻率更大之電位器，則容最較小者，亦可測得。成用較高週率之低週率振盪器，或加高Ｂ電壓，則亦可得同樣之效果。</p>
<p>注意：本文所述之線路，如不在使用時，眞空管務須技去，或燈絲線路中加接一開關，以免虚耗電流。（譯自本年十一月份ＲadioＣraft</p>
<h3>礦石揚聲器</h3>
<p>— 崇武</p>
<p>近來有一種新式揚聲器，利用振盪礦石把電能變成音波，這種揚聲器，和普通式樣的不同，裏面没有磁石，全賴礦石的奇異特性來工作。很久以前，無綫電工程師巳經知道這種現象，就是當ＲocheleＳalt礦石放在靜電磁塲内時，立即有振盪發生，這種奇異的工能，呌做Ｐeizoelectric效果，現在已用牠來造成有效力的揚聲器了。</p>
<p>在外形上看起來，這種揚聲器，和動力式相彷，可是動力式裏面的變壓器和笨重磁石等，在礦石揚聲器内，却給一個很簡單的中空圓室代替了，室内裝有一片精細磨成的Ｒocbelesait礦石，成小正方形，三隻角端都用橡皮夾穩，餘下的一角可以自由移動，連在錐形喇叭的音臂上，另外在礦石的兩面附着兩簿銅片而成兩極。當收音機内低週率放大器發出的脈動重流，加到這兩片和電容器相似的銅片上，礦石遂旋絞彎曲，結果激起一串振盪，籍三角端橡皮夾的作用，這些振盪經音臂傳到喇叭内而成音波。</p>
<p>礦石揚聲器若與磁感式及動力式相比較，則有幾種優點，最主要的，就是牠的構造簡單，不易失效，並且因爲内部不需磁石，所以輕巧便利，例如下圖所示揚聲器，重量只有兩鎊多，厚度還不到三寸半呢。下圖所示揚聲器，僅由一簡單礦石發動，還有許多别種式樣，特别是設計來迎合公共演說和劇場需要的，裏面裝有四塊礦石片，相互連結起來而發動一個喇叭或薄膜。</p>
<p>這種礦石揚聲器還有一層優點，就是特别適合於雙揚聲器的裝置，當牠和動力式揚聲器並列工作時，比較用兩個動力式並列所得的結果好得多，因之推而廣之，就是需要多隻揚聲器並列工作時，牠們也是很值得採用的！</p>

<h3>交直流二用收音機</h3>
<p>— 程權</p>
<p>近年　内各埠，使用交流電者漸多故交流收音機亦能用於各地。但除少數大城市外，以無日電之供給爲多，故交流收音機仍未能十分適用。如日夜均用直流機，則手續極不便，且亦十分不經濟。下述之交直流兩用機，可解决上述難題，線路十分簡單，頗合自製之用。有志者不妨一試。圖中Ｌ１Ｌ２Ｌ３爲普通三回路線圈，Ｌ４爲ＲＦＣ之用中心分線者，自製亦可。用一寸管繞三十六號線八百圈，四百圈處出一頭接礦石ＣＤ之煩，ＶＣ１爲普通廿一片之可變電容器。礦石須購最靈敏者。本機之音量全視礦石優劣而定，且須固定者。以免調節之煩，ＶＣ１爲普通廿一片之可變電容器，ＶＣ２爲小形十三片者，用以調節再生。Ｔ１Ｔ２爲三比一之低週率變壓器。Ｖ１Ｖ２Ｖ３均爲ＲＣＡ２０１（旁特４０１飛利浦５０９均同）。Ｃ１爲００二固定式。Ｃ２各爲二ＭＦＤＣ３爲一ＭＦＤ。ＨＦＣ爲三十亨利低週扼制一圈。普通低週率變壓器之次級亦能代用。Ｒ爲一千五百歐姆。Ｒ１爲六歐姆可變電阻，Ｒ２爲二百歐姆分壓器。ＰＴ爲電源變壓器，自製亦可。Ｓ爲開關，Ｓ１三刀雙投開關。製造時請注意下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）此線路爲來復式。</p>
<p>故各另件須十分精良。</p>
<p>（二）電源須與收音機分置以减少雜聲。</p>
<p>（三）電源幾壓器之初級須視當地之電壓而定。如電壓不準須多繞分頭以調整之。</p>
<p>（四）在距電台百里内可放喇叭。</p>
<p>（五）用交流而欲加大音量。則Ｖ２可改用ＲＣ１１２ＡＡ。</p>
<p>（六）直流用六弗打一百安培之蓄電池及九十弗之乾電池。如交直互用，可用三四月之久。</p>

<p>（二十）眞空管概說（四）</p>
<p>（七）交流式眞空管：前此所述各種眞空管，均屬直流式者，以之用於直流式收音機則可，以之用於交流式收音機則不可。然自交流式眞空管發明，屏除了向來之缺點，其發達之速度一日千里，遂成今日之交流式收音機萬能時代焉。　　原來舊時直流式之眞空管（例如ＵＸ２０１），如將Ａ電池屏去，代之以Ａ代電器（Ａeliminator），供給電燈線交流電於眞空管之燈絲，則往往發生一種雜音丨俗稱之曰交流言（Ｈum）丨擾亂正音以致不能實用，交流式眞空管則將燈絲改良，使能通用於交流，而無發生交流音之虞。此種交流式眞空管因燈絲構造之不同，而分有直熱式交流管與傍熱式交流管之兩種。兹略述不相同構造於次。</p>
<p>（Ａ）直熱式交流管：交流音發生之最大原因乃在於温度之變化與栅極燈絲間電位差之變化。直熱式交流管乃將此兩種現象改良，使其變化盡量減少。該管之燈絲係利用塗氣化料（ＯxideＣoated）使其熱情性增大，又使電流加大而將供給電壓Ｅf低减，栅極與燈絲間之電位差之變化亦盡量遞减。其他部分幾與直流式管無異。如ＵＸ２２６，ＵＸ２４５即屬直熱式管之一種，而ＵＸ２２６號式管之規格大體與直流管ＵＸ２０１Ａ相同，然其交流音或减至十分之一。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）傍熱式交流管：傍熱式管係將燈絲之兩種作用丨發熱作用與放射作用丨分離，使其個别舉行者，其司發熱作用之部分稱曰燈絲或加熱部（Ｈeater），而司放射作用之部分稱曰隂極（Ｃathode）。如ＵＹ２２７，ＵＹ２２４號管即屬傍熱式之一種。上圖爲加熱部與隂極之構造。</p>

<h3>增加入口</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>「不教有三，無後爲大，」「如今雖忙着」「重修孔廟」，「揚倡讀經」，可是這種「反山　夫人主義」的古訓，依然不發生多大生殖切能，而夠不上節育指南」，「避孕實鑑的風頭十足。却不料在這節育世紀」裏，各國却在那裏提倡努力製造小國民，眞是有趣。</p>
<p>意大利自從創行法西斯蒂以來，爲謀擴張民族勢力，我們已久耳盛名其「繁殖政策」了。例如生有子女若干的，由政府年貼若干生活費，能生若干子女的，由政府頒給奬章之類的事情，報上也常有紀載。這一程子，新玩意兒越玩越精采了。在法西斯黨所組織的結婚節那一天，羅馬有二千餘對情侣，舉行結婚，每對可得首相肖影一幀，意幣五百以及糖杏仁。而且教堂裏也十分凑趣，竟肯把不是可輕易得到的殊榮，給與此二千餘對斬夫婦所生之第一孩。唔娶老婆，生孩子，有這多好處，誰不努力到不遺餘力的，就是傻子。</p>
<p>意大利的同志德意志，近來也努力提倡優良的日耳曼種的繁殖。據其統計局柏格都福博士的發表，說若德國人不努力生產小孩子，維持不住相當的人口出手率，那麽，依了過去七十年内的人口减少率推算，在五世以内，人口將跌落到四十分之一。這一種騖人的妙論，自然，不啻　素以愛國，馳名邇遐的日耳曼人，移接了青春　，給與了一服　有力的興奮劑。若再經我們的希大哥登高一呼，還怕不能在明年此日，家家户户，舉行湯餅大會麽。</p>
<p>就以蘇俄而論，不談甚麽民族，但是據說爲了增加革命力量起見，也在那裏關起了大門，勸民衆們努力替政府製造未來的戰士。除了因生理的關係者之外，墮胎，是一個很大的罪名。正式夫婦所生的子女不算外，私生子也是法律所承認的。說來說去，這也無非是爲了要增加人口，至於我們的東鄰，更是把增加人口，視作擴張軍備，同樣重要的一回事，那是誰都不能否認的。</p>
<p>從世界大勢看來，「無後」，豈只不孝，簡直是「不忠」。所以我勸不甘爲時代的落伍者的摩登光棍們，趕快登報微婚，擇吉迎娶」。己結婚的夫婦們，趕快把「種子金丹」當飯吃，以便一索再索，爲國努力。</p>
<h3>樂得</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>我在那一家浴池裏洗澡洗了二三年洗慣。二三年來的生活雖然改變了好幾次，但地不論逺近，時不論冬夏春秋，十九往那裏去浴。不知道是那一天，一個短小精悍的小夥計忽然笑嘻嘻老着面皮喊我「樂得」丨於是乎每去一躺，他們一個個笑嘻嘻喊我「哦！樂得」丨或者說：「唔！樂得又來了」！</p>
<p>在我呢？覺得很有趣味丨一邊敷衍他們，一邊心裏却自己獨自想：「唉丨樂得？多麽美麗的代名詞丨可是樂得什麽呢？孤身隻影，寄跡天涯，旣没有人們那等優美環境，讀書向學，進一步求高深學術，有何可樂？又没有人們那等多量財富，隨意支配，用之得當，有何可得？</p>
<p>然而，他們總要喊，不但來時喊，去時還要喊：「哦！樂得去了」！</p>
<p>那一家浴池裏的美點是浴巾浴座時常保持潔白，招待得又極週到。我慣了，常拿他們的擦身藻無條件應用，也常攀談一切；他們有的是坦白，直率，眞誠，前後如一的性格與表情；除了應得之外，毫無過分苛求；在先使我感覺他們那兒在世途上是個平坦的一條小道。心裏巴不得天天去淴浴，常常見面只是一個樂！後來我想他們這一些人無異木石，只知有己，不知有人；只知道爲個己的衣食而服務社會，並不知道爲廣大的羣衆而盡力社會。正太史公所謂「衆庶憑選而己！因之不覺對他們又有些怏怏！但他們總比較不勞而獲要受法律制裁的人好，我終是喜歡和他們周旋！</p>
<p>那一家浴池我旣常常去，裏邊的布置：像那金漆的浴資價目牌，那富於曲線美的對對洗澡西洋裸體少女，那扞脚出血的聲明單，官座，特座，普通座…一切的一切，差不多我都可以畫了出來丨最顯著的是一副對聯：「雙影波中紅葉日麗　鳳棲池上碧藻烟横」</p>
<p>樂得去，樂得來，來來去去，都是樂得；今天眞個樂得，所以順便寫了這篇隨筆。也許是都會中的一種風光吧！</p>
<h3>弔江灣</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>因爲要去參加總理銅像揭幕禮，所以起了一個早，趁車子到市商會去，走過河南路橋，風迎面的吹來，已使你感到初冬的天氣。橋上，在晨議時節，所走邊的都是那些苦工和乞丐，祗見塌車，不見汽車，和中午時節的汽車雜杳，男女同行，顯然分成了兩種不同樣的壁纍。</p>
<p>八點鐘出發，但到了九點鐘才啓行，早知如此，我何必起早，啊！這是中國人的習慣呀！我眞是獃子！十幾輛平時裝載貨物的卡車，載着一二千人：男的，女的，壯年和青年，都混雜在裏面，我當然也是其中的一份子。</p>
<p>經過了北車站，離開了鬧市，一列卡車開始踏入了隂風吹吹，鬼氣森森的寳山路上，砲燬後的北車站已修理工竣，將使你看不出戰後的遺跡，但寳山路上斷垣碎瓦還是觸目傷心，昔年鬧市，現在祗留着一片瓦礫塲了。「寳山路不會再興發了，要是商務印書館不造」。「那東方圖書館，中國唯一的文化機關，砲燬是最可惜！」「這裏還有殘餘的黄菊，從前是一個花園，現在祗留下一片荒塲！」經過商務書館的屋殼，和東方圖書館的遺影時，我們在無秩序的你一句我一句說。</p>
<p>車馳過了寳山路，便到江灣路，這裏又改變了一種色彩彩，在荒草地上，零落的矮屋，毫無秩序的站在上面。這裏也不是戰地嗎！焚燒過的，砲轟過的不完整的碎屋，時常有得使你看見，這的確是聰明人的方法，被砲轟過的屋，如果没有完全倒塌，把板遮起來，找磚瓦疊成短墻連房租都不必出的，許多的平民，就這樣住在這種破屋裏面。</p>
<p>風一陣陣的吹來，國旗和寒風是對壘着，拍拍的飄飛，在寒風中，天氣雖是很晴朗，但我似乎聽見志士的隂魂在那號哭啊！這裏便是他們的戰塲，他們的死地，我們的車輛也許已輾着了他們的遺骸，爲的是不爭氣的我們不能替他們復仇，使他們祇是在空中長號呢！</p>
<h3>不爭氣</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>提倡國貨的聲浪越高了販賣仇貨的奸商，也隨之增多，這種不爭氣的賣國賊，他們根本却没有國家觀念存在胸中。</p>
<p>父母對於小有聰明的兒女，最是歡喜不過，但是越是歡喜這種兒女，他們長大，每每就不替父母爭氣。</p>
<p>内地的商店·口口聲聲說是不二價，但是櫃欄上不爭氣的夥友，仍是做的大可二價的生意。</p>
<p>越是貪官污吏，他外表的架子，越要擺得清廉，假使一旦塌台，他不怪自己不替國家爭氣，却怪手下的爪牙，不替自己爭氣。</p>
<p>貌美而沾有浪漫習氣的妻子，憑你做丈夫的對待伊怎樣要好，伊在遇異性追逐的時候，緑頭巾不問丈夫願戴不願戴，伊却不替丈夫爭氣。</p>
<p>聲名狼藉的朋友，對人說話時，偏歡喜自擺自吹，但是他名譽的不爭氣，早己給對方一個相當的認識，相當的定論。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>積之雖然默不作聲，只聽些旁人的言語，但是見了這大樓的影子以後，他心裏忽然跳動着一陣，難道就這樣一節一節的，把桂枝送到家裏去，就算完事嗎？送他到了家以後，我向那裏去？還是在海甸街上溜幾個灣呢？還是到乳茶店裏去坐一會子呢？溜灣固然是無意識而且怕碰到了熟人。可是到乳茶舖裏去坐着呢？也是一件笑話。由大紅門進城，坐了電車到西直門，由西直門再坐長途汽車到海甸來，這就爲了到乳茶舖裏來喝一碗甜水來着嗎？若是都不可能，自己就坐了原汽車回去吧？但是汽車要開到香山以後，再開回來呢。至少還有兩三小時的躭擱，這兩三小時，呌自己在那裏安身？心裏是這樣的躊躇着，臉上就不免把那副愁態，顯了出來。桂枝心裏想着，這是我的不對，人家好意替我買票，引我上車。我看他那情形，就無　回海甸，不過是送我一程，我爲什麽倒給人家不好的臉子看呢？於是就向積之笑道：到了海甸，上我們家去坐坐吧？積之突然的回答道：不必去了。他原是一句牢騷話。說出來之後，倒有些後悔我爲什麽不必去呢？桂枝只聽到他這一句不必去了，至於他心裏立刻在懊悔着，那可不知道。便笑道：好，改天見罷。說話時，汽車己經在海甸街頭，停着了。桂枝隨着乘客扒着車門下了車。積之由車門一跳，站在地面上，兩手拍了幾下灰。桂枝因他由逺道送了回來，就這樣的走去，心裏心免有點過意不去，站在一邊，正望着他呢。（二五五）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>蘇東坡的詩獄</h3>
<p>— 朱霞</p>
<p>蘇東坡以吟詩有譏訕，觸犯了朝庭，事發之日，他還在湖州官任上。蘇轍在南京先得到密報，急遣人告軾，所以，京到湖州時，軾已經在告祖了。宋孔平仲（毅父）在「談苑」裏寫這時的情形道：「僎（皇甫僎，京使也）徑入州廨，具　袍秉笏立庭下，二臺卒夾侍，白衣青巾，顧盼停惡，人心洶洶不可測」，最後，且感概的寫着如次的結語，「頃刻之間，拉一太守，如驅犬鷄，此事無頗（當時的權州）目擊也。」當時，東坡所身受者如何，就此可以想見。後來，他的書也被禁了，關於這，我以前在一篇文章裏己經談到。日昨，看宋朱弁（少章）的「風月堂詩話」，又獲得很好的資料。其文云：</p>
<p>東坡詩文，落筆輒爲人所傳誦。每一篇到歐公處，公爲終日喜，前後類如此。一日，與斐論文及坡，公歎曰：「汝記吾言，三十年後，世上人更道不着我也。」崇寗大觀間，海外詩聖行，後生不復有言歐公者。是時朝廷雖嘗禁止，賞錢增至八十萬，禁愈嚴而其傳愈多，往往以多相夸。士大夫不能誦坡詩者，便自覺氣索，而人或謂之不韻。（卷一）</p>
<p>東坡文在當時的影響，與夫查禁之嚴，即此可見一斑。「禁愈嚴而其傳愈多」，古今情形，竟如一轍。東坡在詩獄上，精神上所受的損害，頗是不小。當他被捕解京時，見捕吏的洶洶，以爲是絶大的禍事，所以，行到太湖時，在一個風濤傾倒，月色如畫的晚上，竟想跳水自殺，但怕死後累及蘇轍，又取消此念。到京下獄以後，仍以爲必死，預藏「青金丹」備自殺，且作詩别轍，有「百年未了先償債，十口無依更累人」，「與君世世爲兄弟，更結人間未了困」等句。但是，東坡在此時，精神上雖受了大損害，出獄後，竟又故態復萌，大作其詩，並私自駡曰“「猶不改也。」其實，這不改，是必然的，因爲刑罰的壓逼，終不如精神被束縛的苦痛。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，又想起在宋韓青老農何薘的「春渚紀聞」裏，也有一則關於禁東坡文事，旣從詩獄談到禁書，就把這一則一併抄錄下來，以備研究古今禁書的人們參考研究吧。其文：</p>
<p>紹聖間，朝庭貶責元祐大臣，及禁毁元祐學術文字，有言司馬温公神道碑，乃蘇軾撰述，合行除毁，於是州牒行巡尉毁折碑樓，及碎碑。張山人聞之曰：不須如此行遣，只消令山人帶一個玉册官，去碑額上添鐫兩個「不合」字便了也。碑額本云，「忠清粹德之碑」云。</p>
<h3>談木刻須</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>早些日子本談登過兩篇談木刻的短文，介紹了良友書局新出的幾本連環木刻。木刻的風行到中國似乎還是不久的事情，由幾個書局的提倡（除良友外，現代也印過一薄册中國木刻作家的習作），木刻研究會的興起，以及文藝雜誌的登載，翻譯集子的附刋，差不多已在中國文藝界有了一個小小波瀾了。</p>
<p>木刻是一種看來有點呆板的術，但它有比别的東西深進的地方，猶如一個笨人具着聰明人所没有的難能的好處一樣。它不需要任何繁雜的色彩，却只靠黑和白，表出動人的鮮活的形象。它在許多兄弟美術中，是最活潑最豁達最堅强的一位小弟弟。它的工具只幾把小刀，一塊木板和以備印下的許多紙張而已，更無需像油繪一樣儘把顏色在畫板上直調直攪的；可是雖然簡單，刻它却非有深刻的藝術素養，堅强的腕力不可。自然只要能夠畫幾筆的誰都可以用那小刀亂劃，可是包你刻不出好的東西來。所以，有些人以爲木刻是可以大衆化的簡便的門道，實際在製作方面還是十分高超的。</p>
<p>木刻的主點是力，以爽朗的刀痕刻劃下生動的形象；木刻的手段是經濟，把大塲面縮爲一個頂點，收羅許多的「力」使堅固地攢聚在一處，縮得更緊，藴含的「力」便更大，便是上上作品。經濟之間應略帶誇張，譬如刻一個勞動者得把他的拳頭誇張得很大丨丨自然也不可失實　得大過於頭。至於「趕走一個人像趕走一條野狗」的一類譬喻，也是很要緊的。</p>
<p>因爲主點是力，所以木刻是較適合於刻劃人物，尤其是勞動者類的人物。現在我們所見的木刻大都是「粗人」，就是這原故。其次是刻風景，但其特性的效力在風景上已稍稍改少，就我個人觀感，也覺得木刻作風景不能勝過於素描，黑白畫，雖然把一草一木移植於硬硬的刀筆刻劃之下是另一番景像。</p>
<h3>豐災</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>六多聽到同伴的咳嗆，便回頭去瞧了一眼，又特意向船艙裏那些米袋望了好半天。自從開船到現在，有半個多鐘頭，他的眼睛常常在這些米袋上打轉。今年的收獲，實在也不好算壞了，平均每畝田收二石半，在前幾年有這樣的收獲，眞得拉開嘴笑了，摇了船上城去還租，回來時候便可以買點東西，到過年，小毛她們都有添一件新棉襖的份了。如今收成好，六多還是天天在發愁。不是嗎？米價比前幾年賤多了，即使每畝田收到三石，也抵不上以前咧。他嘆口氣，摇着舵就好像没氣力似的，逺逺的望着天和地接連的地方。那個同伴秋堂又咳了起來，他才嘆口氣說：</p>
<p>「我算來算去，今年跟去年一樣，又是白辛苦呢！」</p>
<p>「你還比我好多啦，你我，自己身體壞，請了人帮忙，今年又虧本了，到過年還得借七八十塊錢，付王大爺的利息，今年春間又向他們借了一百塊，說利息一分三還看我是熟人的面子呢！六多你愁什麽，像我，要是仔細一想，那裏還活得下去，只好去吊死了。你知道我一共有多少債？…」秋堂說着又咳了好一回。</p>
<p>六多用力地吐一口痰，那口痰隨着一堆垃圾向後退了過去。</p>
<p>「這年頭眞怪，米價這麽跌，好像是太平時候。聽到前輩講到從前一元錢一袋米的時光，日子比現在好過多了，現在米儘管跌下去，可是没有一個人不說日子難過的。」</p>
<p>一羣鳥在天空吵着。秋堂又咳了一聲嗽，没有回答，只望着碧藍的天。</p>
<p>「收租的人也喊着過不下去，不要說我們了，可是我不懂什麽人在過着好日子！」</p>
<p>「我聽得茶館裏老三說的，米價賤，因爲洋米進得太多的緣故。收成不壞，爲什麽要進了那麽多的洋米，眞是見鬼！六多，你說收租的人嗎？他們少收了許多錢，自然也覺得苦了，他們是好吃好用慣了的。可是他們只要少用一點也得了，像我們，那才是…」</p>
<p>「昨天米價七元半，不是你性急，我還要等一兩天呢，說不定會漲一點的。」</p>
<p>那一個却摇摇手，做了個並不同意的臉色，還是咳嗆着。</p>
<p>兩人都沉默了，只有船舵潑動流水的聲音，輕輕地，有節奏地。</p>
<p>船進了市河，便行得慢了，許多賣菜賣柴的船，很麻煩的擋着去路。秋堂再没有餘閒咳嗽，把竹篙子忙着抵住人家的船，生怕碰撞。他的心却不住地跳動，擔憂着今天的米價會不會又跌了下去，王大爺肯不肯多打一點折扣。</p>
<p>幾家米行的牆壁上的大字，巳經糢糊地見到了，他彷彿臨刑的囚犯一樣，心裏更没有了主意，回頭看看六多，也是皺着眉頭。</p>
<p>「秋堂，你們怎麽這樣慢？」</p>
<p>米行跟前停了七八條米船，有兩條還没有把米起岸。</p>
<p>「我們開得遲咧，今天怎麽啦？」</p>
<p>那一個氣憤地說：「七元二！」</p>
<p>「七元二？秋堂和六多都驚呆了。</p>
<p>「有什麽說的？還了租回家去等着餓死吧！」</p>
<p>六多對秋堂望了望，放下舵，嘆了口氣。</p>

<h3>兩兄弟（四十六）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>他希望可以在動身之前不看見她，不在她的兩頰上擱下那先就使他惡心的接吻。</p>
<p>可是她回答道：</p>
<p>「你等一下，我來給你開門。不過你要等我回到床上才可以進來。」</p>
<p>他聽到她赤脚踏在教板上，隨後是拉開門閂的聲音。她呌道：</p>
<p>「進來罷。」</p>
<p>他進去了。她坐在床上，羅蘭在她旁邊，頭上包着一塊絹，面對着牆壁，死死地睡着。如果别人不把他摇醒或拖起，便什麽都不能把他吵醒的。他出去釣魚的那些日子，那是水手巴巴格里在約定的時候來拉門鈴把女僕呌醒，然後再由女僕來把她的主人從這深沉的睡眠裡拖起。</p>
<p>筆爾一面向他母親走去，一面瞧着她，突然覺得像是從來没有過她似的。</p>
<p>她把兩頰伸給他，他一面吻了一下，隨後便坐在一把矮椅上。</p>
<p>「你是昨晚决定到特洛威爾去頑的嗎？」她說「不錯，是昨晚决定的。」</p>
<p>「你回來吃晚飯嗎？」</p>
<p>「我現在還不知道。總之，你們不必等我。」</p>
<p>他以一種令人駭絶的好奇心審視着她。這是他的母親呀，這婦人！從小起，從他的眼睛能夠分辨東西的時候起，便看見的這整個臉龐，這微笑，這如此熟悉，如此親熱的聲音，全使他突然覺得很生分似的，和他至今所看到聽到的完全兩樣。他現在才知道以前他疼愛她，却從没有細看過她。這雖仍舊是她，並且她臉上最細微的處所他全知道；但他却是第一次明白地看到這些細微的處所。當他惴惴地仔細探索着這親愛的頭顱時，她便在他的眼襄現出和以前兩樣，現出一副他從來没有發見的像貌。</p>
<p>他站起身預備走，隨後，突然又被從昨晚起便嚙着他的心的，那種想要知道的强烈的欲望所克服：</p>
<p>「喂，我記得從前我們住在巴黎時，客廳裏有着瑪賴沙的一個小肖像，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>她躊躇了一兩秒鐘，或至少他覺得她躊躇了一下，隨後她說道：</p>
<p>「對啦。」</p>
<p>「這小肖像現在弄到那裏去了呢？」</p>
<p>在他的意思，她還儘可以回答得更快一點：</p>
<p>「這肖像……等一等……我記不大清楚了……或者放在我的寫字桌裡罷。」</p>
<p>「請你把牠尋出來好不好？」</p>
<p>「好，我等會兒去尋。你要牠做什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「啊！這不是爲着我。我覺得這肖像最好給哲安，並且這事可以使他高興的。」</p>
<p>「對啦。你有這理，這是個好想頭。等我起來了便去找。」</p>

<h3>The Zhejiang-Fujian Border: Two Armies in Close Proximity; Yao Cong Appointed Garrison Commander of Wenzhou; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies Various Governments Not to Enter into Diplomatic Relations with Fujian</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) There are widespread rumors of contact between the Central Army and the Fujian Army in the Xianxia Ridge area on the Zhejiang border. Today, a person in charge of the provincial government said that this statement is not yet accurate, but the situation is serious, and a war may be unavoidable. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Central Army dispatched from Zhejiang Province has reached Jianyang in northern Fujian and will move down the Min River to connect with Liu Heding's 12,000 troops in Jianning. The vanguard of the 19th Route Army has arrived in Yanping and is preparing for battle. It is expected that fighting will break out within the next half month. The two sides are currently only thirty miles apart. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yao Cong Appointed Garrison Commander of Wenzhou</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chairman Chiang appointed Yao Cong, Deputy Adjutant of the Military Headquarters, as the Garrison Commander of Wenzhou. All land, air forces, and local militias in the Wenzhou and Chuzhou prefectures are under his command. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Shangzhi Returns to Fujian</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Liu Shangzhi, a brigade commander dispatched by Liu Heding, visited Chiang in Jiangxi and then visited Lu Diping in Hangzhou. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies Foreign Embassies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that as the Fujian province organizes a puppet government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a notification to the embassies of various countries in China on November 27, requesting them to convey to their respective governments not to enter into any diplomatic relations with the puppet government, otherwise the Chinese government will not be responsible. It is also reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our embassies in various countries to convey this intention to their respective governments at the nearest opportunity. Diplomatic circles are now confident that friendly countries will not have any diplomatic relations with the puppet government. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Winter Defense Begins Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Zhejiang Province's winter defense began on the 1st. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mao Bangchu Talks About Solid Zhejiang Defenses</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Mao Bangchu, Deputy Principal of the Aviation School, and Jiang Jianren, Director of Political Training, arrived in Nanjing from Hangzhou. Mao said that before the Fujian Incident, the Central Government had heard about the brewing of events in Fujian and had made preparations in advance, dispatching troops to defend the Zhejiang-Fujian border. Although the Fujian side currently has a tendency to invade Zhejiang, Zhejiang's defenses are solid enough to resist. Hangzhou is as peaceful as usual, and no accidents are likely to occur. The Aviation School has been prepared for a long time, but the time for action has not yet arrived. All aircraft of the Aviation School are under the command of military organs. The aircraft that have been flying reconnaissance missions over Fujian in recent days were dispatched by the Nanchang Military Headquarters. The Fujian side is a disorganized group, and judging from the situation, it will soon disintegrate. The Fujian side's air force strength is weak, with only a dozen training aircraft and two or three fighter aircraft. Therefore, its air combat power is absolutely unreliable and not worth a single blow. It is rumored that I will be appointed as the Air Force Commander of the punitive expedition, but this is just hearsay, and I have not received any such news. Liu Heding, Lu Xingbang, and Zhou Zhiqun, the three divisions of the Fujian Army, are still on the Zhejiang border of Fujian Province and have not come into contact with the 19th Route Army. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, our people have had a considerable awakening regarding the air force and have donated money to purchase aircraft to assist the Central Government. However, after more than a year, only nine aircraft have been raised by Shanghai merchants, Shanghai workers, Boy Scouts, and Whampoa, etc., and the enthusiasm seems to have faded. This is not as good as Japan, where the public has raised 40 to 50 million yuan for aircraft in more than a year. The difference is like heaven and earth. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will continue to donate money. Xu Peigen, the director, previously planned to form a volunteer team with the nine aircraft donated by the public, but there are still people from the Pingpu and Pinghan railways, as well as the public from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, who are continuing to donate money for aircraft. It is now planned to form two volunteer teams after eighteen aircraft are put together, and then station them permanently in the capital area for guard and reconnaissance purposes. Therefore, this matter needs to be delayed for a while before proceeding. It is undeniable that Aviation School aircraft sometimes crash. Aviation is a rising science in our country, and military organs have a certain stage for creating air force talent. Advanced air force countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom cannot avoid the danger of the air force. Therefore, aircraft crashes are not surprising, and the training of aviation talent is continuous and unimpeded. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Observations</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) As the new government's Foreign Minister Chen Youren is actively preparing for war, he declared to a special correspondent of Reuters that there is absolutely no possibility of contact with the communist army in Jiangxi Province. However, this statement is probably made to avoid external accusations against the new government. Foreign observers here regard the People's Government as purely farcical. It is said that the new government was established on November 20. The so-called Provisional People's Representative Assembly was formed by gathering students, coolies, etc. Each coolie who attended the meeting was given three corners. The only Fujianese who spoke on the podium was Sa Zhenbing, a former Minister of the Navy. Although he wished the new government success, he solemnly stated that he was forced to attend the meeting. The Fujianese do not support the new government but do not dare to express it publicly. Although students support the revolution, they do not regard the new government as legitimate either. They were forced to hold red and blue flags to lead the parade, but they dragged the flags and allowed them to be soiled with mud to express their dissatisfaction. The 19th Route Army was initially welcomed because it resisted the Japanese in Shanghai. The Fujianese thought that they could get its protection and avoid the disaster of communism. However, the 19th Route Army did not go to the front line itself but ordered Liu Heding's troops and the Fujian Army to take charge of the war. Furthermore, the 19th Route Army appointed its own people to take over important positions in Fujian Province to replace the Fujianese. This matter has especially lost the support of the people. If the new government does not receive foreign aid, it will be difficult to last because its military and financial resources are not as good as the Central Government's, and the Central Government also has a superior air force. The 19th Route Army has a total of five divisions, about 50,000 people, and only 30 aircraft. Most of the troops are stationed on the Fujian-Guangdong border, and the headquarters is located in Zhangzhou. If other provinces do not provide assistance, the Fujian Incident will become a thing of the past in less than a month. The Fujianese are deeply afraid of alliance with the communists, but the Fujianese here do not know whether there is any relationship between the new government and the Red Army. The Fujianese regard the People's Revolutionary Government as a foreign product. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Discusses the Current Situation</h3>

The printing has been completed and airplanes will be dispatched to distribute them. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Temporarily Postpones Dispatching Central Committee Members to Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke told a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 1st that the Central Government's dispatch of committee members to the Southwest has been temporarily delayed.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Plans to Stay in Mount Tai for a Long Time; Chen Mingshu Once Telegraphed Inviting Him to Fujian; Feng Replied "I Have No Capital"</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, Feng Pingxiang (Yuxiang) is not concerned about current affairs in Mount Tai. Three days before the Fujian Incident, Feng received a telegram from Chen Mingshu saying that the situation here would have new developments, hoping that he would come to Fujian immediately. After receiving the telegram from Fujian, Feng replied, "I have no capital." When the Fujian Incident occurred, the new Fujian organization was announced, appointing him as the Chairman of the Economic Committee. Feng denied it in a telegram to Hu and others because he had not participated in it, stating that his personal position had nothing to do with the Fujian Incident. In order to avoid suspicion, Feng recently instructed the staff at his residence in Mount Tai not to meet with outside guests. At the same time, he telegraphed Song, returning the guard regiment Peng Guozheng brought with him to the 29th Army. Song has telegraphed Liu Ruming to come to Beiping from Xiahuayuan. Liu arrived in Beiping today and immediately visited Song for instructions. Personnel will be dispatched to Shandong within the next few days to conduct an inventory and reorganize, returning them to their original establishment. Feng plans to only keep a technical guard of twenty or thirty people to serve as guards and plans to stay in Tai'an for a long time, with no preparations to go to Beijing. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Rumors that Feng left Mount Tai for Fujian several days ago have now been dispelled. However, Feng is unwilling to express his opinion on the current situation, which is similar to what Chen Guoliang told reporters a few days ago. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) At a discussion meeting held by the Political Council on the 1st, Xiao Focheng said that the Central Government had not yet responded to the Southwest's telegram. The Southwest believes that Fujian is clearly betraying the Party and the country, and there is no possibility of cooperation, so it has decided to suspend sending personnel to Fujian and take a wait-and-see attitude for the time being. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Arima Arrives in Nanjing, Visits Wang, States That Japan Has No Intention of Aiding the Fujian Incident, Hopes Our Government Will Protect Japanese Residents in Xiamen, Hirota Orders Morishima, Chief of the Asian Bureau, to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Minister Arima Akira arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 1st and had discussions with the diplomatic authorities. It is reported that Arima plans to return to his country soon. This visit is purely to bid farewell to our diplomatic authorities and there is no task to negotiate other matters. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Minister to China, Arima Akira, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 1st and visited Wang as Foreign Minister, verbally explaining two points: (1) The Japanese government believes that the Fujian rebellion is an internal problem of China and should not interfere, and especially has no intention of aiding the rebellion. (2) A large number of Japanese residents reside in Fujian Province, with more than 20,000 in Xiamen alone. It is hoped that the Chinese government will pay close attention and not allow the disturbances there to endanger the lives and property of the residents. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the Fujian Incident is an excellent opportunity to implement the continental policy. He has telegraphed Minister Arima to go to Nanjing to make contact and has also sent Goro Morishima, Chief of the First Section of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to China to brief Minister Arima on the situation. This is to follow the old tactics of Foreign Minister Kato in manipulating the revolutionary army to deal with Yuan Shikai in order to deal with the National Government. It is planned that Mr. Morishima will arrive in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on December 6. (1st China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an order today, ordering Wuro Morishima, the director of the First Section of the Asian Bureau, to go to China. At a time when the Chinese political situation is serious due to the Fujian independence issue, the visit to China by Morishima, an important figure in the Asian Bureau, has attracted much attention from all quarters. Morishima said, "I plan to leave Japan within two or three days and go to Shanghai first, staying for a week. This visit to China has no special mission." (1st Japan Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Wuro Morishima, Director of the First Section of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was ordered by Foreign Minister Hirota to depart from Tokyo on the evening of the 2nd to go to Shanghai to meet with Minister Arima and discuss issues related to China. At a time when Chinese internal affairs are chaotic, the meeting between the two has aroused considerable attention. (1st News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before taking office, the new ambassador to Belgium, Hachiro Arita, decided to observe the major places in China first. He departed from Tokyo at 1:00 PM on the 1st and is scheduled to return to Japan in three weeks, and then take office. (1st Japan Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota strongly advocated for emergency diplomatic expenses at the Cabinet meeting yesterday and urged all cabinet members to consider the overall situation and not allow the political situation to shake. Foreign Minister Hirota said that a good opportunity has been obtained for the China policy. After Fujian Province declared independence, it was an excellent opportunity for Japan to take action. The Chinese people pay attention to Japan's political changes. If it is a domestic political struggle, losing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would be a great loss to the country. Diplomatic work with the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom is also at the most critical juncture, and he sincerely hopes that all ministers will discuss it carefully.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy of Sowing Discord; The Future of Japan's Pro-American Policy and the Relations Between Britain-Japan and Soviet Union-Japan</h3>
<p>Since Hirota Hiroki succeeded Uchida Yasuya's "scorched earth diplomacy," he has highly touted his so-called "righteous diplomacy." However, the situation remains stagnant, as in fact he cannot violate the established policies of the military. Since the September 18th Incident, the extreme stagnation between China and Japan, from diplomacy to economy, has been caused. Even if a temporary easing can be achieved politically, it will be difficult to completely resolve in the future. In addition to the China issue, the seeds of disaster that it has provoked with other countries are also erupting one after another. The resolution of thirteen votes against one and the vote of forty-two against one by the League of Nations in February of this year are significant indications. After hitting walls on all sides, the Japanese warlords are still unaware of the errors of the past. They only admit the political mistakes made by Foreign Minister Uchida during his tenure. Therefore, they slightly changed their diplomatic rhetoric and temporarily relaxed the side of competing with the United States for dominance in the Pacific, wanting to open up new paths diplomatically. What is this path? It is the so-called "pro-American and anti-British theory." As far as the current situation is concerned, the only export of Japan, raw silk, relies on the American market for 90% of its sales. And the export of American cotton to the East relies on Japan the most. Based on this argument, it seems reasonable to promote pro-Americanism. However, what Japan and the United States are contending for is not the exchange of trade in the past, nor the diplomatic maneuvering at the moment, but the future development of the market and the current determination of hegemony in the Pacific. Domestically in Japan, there is now a strong advocacy of the extraordinary period of 1936, vigorously increasing the naval budget for the next year to more than 600 million yen. This shows that the fundamental hostility has not been eliminated and there will be many dangers in the future. However, on the one hand, it uses its diplomatic skills to reduce the intensification of the conflict between Japan and the United States. On the other hand, it starts from the side to make the relationship between Britain and the United States deteriorate. It can then profit from it, and can control the international political situation in the West Pacific.</p>
<p>Although the British and American nations have all kinds of differences in national relations, political positions, and economic interests, it is not easy to find a truly appropriate and uniform point of agreement on the maritime hegemony and financial investment competing with each other. Moreover, since the World Economic Conference broke up unhappily this summer, the opposition between the gold pound and the gold yuan has become increasingly acute. The competition for the market has been intensified by the US buying of cash, causing huge resentment. At the same time, the Anglo-American tariff war is about to begin, so there will be another wave on the Atlantic. Then, can Japan's pro-American policy succeed? Can it also achieve results by taking advantage of the discord between Britain and the United States to squeeze Britain out of the East Asian market? Yes.</p>
<p>The recent policy of sowing discord advocated by famous figures in the Japanese diplomatic world, can it reap the effect of sowing discord at this time? Here, we cannot but analyze it. At the same time, we can further point out the errors in recognition of this kind of divisive policy of Japan in order to clarify today's international situation.</p>
<p>First. The Japanese misunderstood where the true intention of our Chinese people lies. To say that China has realized that resisting Japan is wrong is just one-sided propaganda. Since September 18th and up to the present, the claim of our people to Japan has not changed.</p>
<p>Second. Although it is not easy to reconcile the conflict between the UK and the US, it will definitely not break down and will not listen to the manipulation of the Japanese. The US diplomatic tactics towards Europe and East Asia are indeed not as agile as those of Japan. However, its feeling that it is difficult to take care of the Far East problem and there is no real intention to be pro-Japanese is the actual situation. Therefore, we observe that Japan's pro-American theory is just empty talk on paper.</p>
<p>Third. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union is a fait accompli. The focus of the US and the Soviet Union is on economics, and in the Far East diplomacy</p>

<h3>Japan's Rapid Economic Invasion: Italy Also Advocates a United Response; First Step is to Contact Soviet Russia; German Newspapers Loudly Complain</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to a Rome correspondent for Le Matin, the development of the Japanese economy is causing great concern in Rome. Italian newspapers are filled with bizarre figures to prove the dangers of Japanese dumping policies, such as bicycles made in Japan selling for only fifty lire, electric lights selling for only twenty-five centimes each, and clocks being sold by weight. However, this is not enough to harm Italy. What Italy is most worried about is that Japanese cotton textiles monopolize the Asian market and exclude goods from European countries, and that Japanese rayon invades Italy. Italian newspapers all say that in order to prevent the invasion of Japanese commerce, Italy can only coordinate with other countries that feel the same threat to establish strict discipline in commerce to guard against it. For example, countries such as Soviet Russia, which benefit from opposing Japan, should be contacted by Italy. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will mediate between Germany and Russia to bring them closer to consolidate Italy's position in Eastern Europe. It is also rumored that Italy will mediate between Soviet Russia and the Vatican so that they can compromise on religious issues. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes New Consulate General in Geneva to Inquire About League of Nations Movements</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to establish an agency in Geneva to collect international information and inquire about the movements of the League of Nations in order to implement its diplomatic policy after withdrawing from the League of Nations. The preparations for this are now complete. It is scheduled to establish a new Consulate General in Geneva on December 1st and appoint Masayuki Yokoyama as the first Consul General. Yokoyama previously served as Deputy Director of the Information Department of the Japanese League of Nations Affairs Bureau and actively participated in the deliberations of the Sino-Japanese issue by the League of Nations with Shoshi Ito and others. (1st Japan Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt published an editorial entitled "Does Japan Really Practice Dumping?" It said, "The economies of South American countries actually rely on the export of two or three kinds of goods to support their economies. Since the European War, the sales of these goods in the markets of Europe and the United States have become narrower and narrower, and South American countries have had no choice but to sell them to the Asian market at low prices. Japanese industrialists have obtained these cheap raw materials and have been able to revitalize their industries more easily, and their export trade has become increasingly developed. Over time, the power of Western countries in the New and Old Worlds will be destroyed by Japan. There are large quantities of wheat, wool, and oil in North and South America that are sold cheaply to Asia to help Japan's commercial dumping. The power is greatly mistaken. Why not open the door and widely accept European immigrants to develop the barren land of the New World? In other words, why not feed the white people with what South America and North America give Japan in countless abundance?" Recently, Brazil and Japan concluded an agreement in which Japan purchased coffee cotton from Brazil, and Japan built warships for it in lieu of the price of goods. From this, it can be seen that South American countries have the power to develop their economies but do not know how to use it themselves, instead allowing Japan to reap its benefits." (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) For the purpose of increasing foreign trade, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs included its expenses in the budget for the next year. As a result of negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, only the establishment costs of one embassy, four consulates, and consular branches were approved. In addition to establishing a new embassy in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in view of the close commercial relations between Japan and Colombia in South America, diverted part of the old budget to establish an embassy in Colombia.

<h3>Japanese Goods Counterfeit British Brands: British Minister of Commerce Condemns as Shameless, Protests Regardless of Courtesy</h3>
<p>(London) Japan's competition by unfair trade practices has recently aroused fierce attacks in the British House of Commons. Today, Minister of Commerce Runciman spoke in the House of Commons, generally indignant about the use of British names and trademarks for Japanese goods. Runciman said that the governments of all countries in the world have the necessity to actively find ways to crack down on this kind of shameless behavior. Therefore, after obtaining conclusive evidence, the British government should file a formal protest with the government of that country regardless of courtesy. If the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty contains provisions that do not allow the British government to interfere, then the British government should abolish it without hesitation. However, it should use all possible means of friendly resolution beforehand. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Movement to Repel Japanese Goods and Abolish the Commercial Treaty: Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Attaches Importance to Developments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The decision made by the British House of Commons on the 29th to repel Japanese goods may be a step towards abandoning the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce in the future. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches importance to this matter and is paying close attention to its subsequent situation. The Conservative Party supports this movement to repel Japanese goods. Before the opening of the Anglo-Japanese Association Conference scheduled for the beginning of next spring, the British side may submit a notice of abandoning the treaty. It is also possible that, in view of the fact that the abandonment of the Japanese-Indian Treaty was quite beneficial to the Japanese-Indian negotiations, the Japanese-English negotiations may also first abandon the Japanese-English Treaty. However, some say that this theory of treaty abandonment is to use the treaty abandonment as an excuse, and the result will be to propose the conclusion of a Japanese-English reciprocal treaty. In short, the Japanese-Indian meeting will come to an end, and the future of the Japanese-English meeting will be full of obstacles. (1st News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Occupy Lower Shenyang, Foreign Businesses Are Not Flourishing: Companies from Various Countries Are Closing Down One After Another; Japanese Businesses Are Remarkably Active and Astonishing</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The recent active state of Japanese merchants in Shenyang is very alarming. In addition to the previous very prosperous foreign companies being oppressed by them, falling into sluggish business conditions, those who closed down or transferred their rights and withdrew to Tianjin and Shanghai in October and November included two British companies such as Deli Company, American companies such as Guangyu Oil Bank, and five German companies such as Peacock Company, French Longdeng Company, Dutch Holland Port Construction Company, and Norwegian Guoguang Company. They all engaged in the business of machinery, medicine, wool, and medical equipment, etc. Due to the end of the anti-Japanese sentiment and low prices, they were gradually oppressed by Japanese goods, especially the Dutch Holland Port Construction Company, due to the withdrawal of its entire financial institution, the Netherlands Bank, suffering a loss of more than 100,000 yuan and withdrawing to Shanghai.

<h3>The Highest Authority in Modern Gonorrhea Treatment == Newly Created = Special: The Pharmacology and Characteristics of "Mei Zhuo Ke Xing" Dr. Adina Discovers Transmembrane Bactericidal Method Physicians Worldwide Can Now Radically Cure Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Free Gonorrhea Treatment New Book Request Letter Based on this Advertisement Send Immediately to Zheng Zheng Mailbox 1465, Shanghai</p>
<h3>□New Treatment for Radical Cure of Gonorrhea□</h3>
<p>The difficulty in eradicating gonorrhea has become a global medical problem. The gonorrhea nest must be healed in order to completely eradicate gonorrhea. How can gonorrhea be considered radically cured? This is something both doctors and patients desire! From a medical standpoint, the elimination of gonorrhea can be considered a cure for gonorrhea, but merely testing the urine and finding no gonorrhea is not enough, because gonorrhea can still be lurking in the depths of the mucous membrane tubes and will still recur when opportunities arise, such as intercourse, drinking, or labor. It is necessary to prove that the gonorrhea in the depths is indeed eliminated in order to achieve the goal. What method can be used to prove that there is no gonorrhea even in the depths? Doctors only need to use a new deep bactericidal drug called "Mei Zhuo Ke Xing"! To completely kill the latent gonorrhea, if after this method, gonorrhea is still not detected and there are no other suspicious symptoms, it can be considered a radical cure. After three months, half a year, or a year, perform the same method again, and if there is no gonorrhea and the course is good, then gonorrhea is completely cured. One more word, even if the man is completely cured, it is useless if his already infected wife is not treated at the same time.</p>

<h3>□Special Healing Effect of "Mei Zhuo Ke Xing"□</h3>
<p>"Mei Zhuo Ke Xing" is Dr. Adina of Germany's forty years of painstaking effort, after 255 animal tests, sent to 878 venereal disease hospitals around the world for experiments, before successfully developing a gonorrhea radical cure medicine! "Special Mei Zhuo Ke Xing" is a newly created, more advanced version of "Mei Zhuo Ke Xing" after its invention. Its kingly medicinal properties and miraculous efficacy can be called perfect and flawless, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary leucorrhea pills on the market. It is truly the greatest new contribution to the medical community in the 20th century!</p>
<p>(1) This drug has the special characteristic of penetrating deep into the mucous membrane cells of the male and female private parts to kill all gonorrhea, so the urine of those who have taken this medicine also has extremely strong bactericidal power. For example, for 20 patients who have taken "Mei Zhuo Ke Xing" for more than seven days, take five "grams" of their urine each and throw in one "platinum loop" of gonorrhea, and it can be killed within 15 minutes. This is the most amazing fact in modern medicine! This product is sold in major pharmacies at home and abroad.</p>
<p>(2) The medicinal properties are mild and without side effects, and are by no means comparable to the harmful and inferior medicines that harm the stomach and intestines and hinder fertility.</p>
<p>(3) It specializes in treating acute and chronic gonorrhea, leucorrhea, female leucorrhea, cystitis, urethritis, and other symptoms, with repeatedly tested and proven special effects.</p>

He agreed to leave after the arrangements are completed. Han will return to Prince De's residence to report. Panchen is scheduled to go to Sui Province, Yikezhao League on the 13th to recite scriptures. Tomorrow or he will go to Beijing.

<h3>Wu Heling Visits President Wang to Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling visited Wang on the afternoon of the 1st to report on the negotiations for Inner Mongolia's autonomy. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling, who returned from Inner Mongolia, said that the Mongolian autonomy issue was negotiated by Huang Zhao and the Mongolian league and banner princes and nobles with sincerity, and the results were very good. However, the Mongolian autonomy plan decided this time was a compromise based on the central government's established principles and the opinions of the Mongolian princes and nobles. The central government stipulated that the banner should be the autonomous unit, and the princes and nobles requested to unite the leagues and banners to organize the entire autonomous government. The current decision is a regional autonomy plan. The content includes 11 articles: (1) Organize Xilingol League and Chahar Department as the first autonomous organ, Wuyuan League and Tumot Alashan Ejina three banners as the second autonomous organ, and after recovering East Mongolia, organize the third and fourth autonomous organs.

<h3>The Process of Resolving the Inner Mongolia Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Jing, a counselor of the National Government, entered Mongolia in October and resolved the Inner Mongolia issue with his fellow counselor Huang. Lin returned to Beijing on November 30. On the 1st, he talked to reporters about the process of resolving the issue, roughly saying that the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue this time was centered on Vice League Leader of Xilinol, Prince De, and League Leader of Wu League, Prince Yun. Prince De and others requested autonomy because the north was threatened by Outer Mongolia and the east feared the invasion of Japanese forces, but they did not consider it a separation movement. The other leagues and banners never joined the autonomy movement from the beginning. Since the central government clearly ordered Huang Zhao to go to Mongolia to advocate and negotiate with Prince De and others in Bailingmiao, Prince De and others first requested to break away from provincial governance and establish an autonomous political organization for Mongolians. However, the central government's Huashi plan carried by Huang said that counties or those included in provincial governance could not be divided, but based on the principle of equality for all ethnic groups, they were very willing to assist Mongolians in autonomy. Fortunately, Huang won the trust of the people, and Ban Hui Xili acted as mediator, and finally achieved a satisfactory result. It was agreed to divide Xilinol League into the first autonomous region government, and Wu League, Yi League, Tu Banner, A Fang, E Banner and others into the second autonomous region government, which would still be assisted by the central government to complete local autonomy. Huang then left the temple for Sui, and discussed the aftermath issues after the division with the Sui and Chahar provincial governments and asked the others, such as the provisions of the boundary between the region government and the provincial government, the division of powers and responsibilities, and the distribution of tax revenue, which must be carefully planned and negotiated to prevent further complications.

<p>(Tokyo) - Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation is clearly a significant event. As a result, all cabinet members are extremely tense and are discussing the matter with each other.

<p>(Tokyo) - Although Finance Minister Takahashi was earnestly requested by Prime Minister Saito several times, and mediated by colleagues, he remained firm and insisted on the second review proposal. Finance Minister Takahashi stated his intention to resign to Prime Minister Saito today for the following reasons: the poverty of the empire's finances is now a major national problem. Despite repeated appeals, the request for an amount exceeding the second review proposal was unexpected. Therefore, he cannot remain any longer. Prime Minister Saito is very distressed by this and is trying to persuade Finance Minister Takahashi to be self-respecting.

Finance Minister Takahashi still firmly insists on not yielding, resulting in the formation of two opposing factions within the current cabinet. The political situation is indeed on the verge of crisis. In order to resolve the situation, Prime Minister Saito visited Finance Minister Takahashi this morning, but the Finance Minister still did not change his strong attitude and said that the financial authorities could no longer consider it, which forced the Prime Minister to resign. Before the cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, and the Railway Minister met at the Prime Minister's official residence and discussed the matter. As a result of the discussion, the Finance Minister said that he could not make any more concessions, as it would endanger the foundation of the country's finances, and insisted on the second review proposal, refusing to compromise. The Prime Minister could only let it go naturally and was powerless to do anything. However, although the budget cabinet meeting will continue tomorrow, if Navy Minister Osumi and Finance Minister Takahashi still stubbornly refuse to budge, it will become an irreparable situation, and the Saito Cabinet has fallen into crisis. (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - After today's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito met with Interior Minister Yamamoto and Railway Minister Mitsuchi in a separate room to discuss ways to resolve the budget issue, which is in crisis. As a result, Railway Minister Mitsuchi and Agriculture Minister Goto met with Navy Minister Osumi and Army Minister Araki to convey the Prime Minister's opinions. Although there was a thorough discussion, no conclusion was reached. They then exchanged opinions with the Prime Minister again. In this way, all the preparations and mediation efforts before tomorrow's budget cabinet meeting may be in vain. Therefore, the only thing that can be expected is a glimmer of hope that Navy Minister Osumi and Finance Minister Takahashi can reach an agreement. (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Military and Finance Ministers Deadlocked</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Navy Ministry held a consultation at 4:00 PM on the 30th regarding the Finance Ministry's review budget proposal. As a result, it was decided to request an increase of 25 million yen for the necessary expenses for the supplementary plan. (Nichiren Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Navy Ministry spent the whole night yesterday organizing the calculations for the restoration request, and finally obtained the final proposal this morning. It has been submitted to the Finance Ministry this afternoon, requesting an amount of over 80 million yen. In addition to the 44 million yen approved by the Finance Ministry, it is requesting an additional 37 million yen. The Navy side considers this to be the final business negotiation. (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The second review proposal for next year's budget was presented to each ministry yesterday, and the ministries' restoration requests are still fierce. Yesterday's emergency cabinet meeting adjourned without any decision, and each cabinet member continued to negotiate. The Finance Ministry's attitude is still extremely strong, taking a total amount of 2.16 billion yen as the final line, and cannot make any more concessions. However, the Army side has always insisted on including additional budget for rural counter-measures and other internal affairs issues. Navy Minister Osumi said that he understood the difficulties of the Finance Minister and tried to reduce expenses, but still maintained a strong attitude towards the realization of the restoration request. (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Regarding the budget issue, the Finance Ministry and the Navy and Agriculture Ministries are in a standoff, and their attitudes are all very strong. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito is very worried about the future of the case and has recently collected information from all parties. He knows that the military's intention is to observe the current situation and does not want to continue the dispute over the budget proposal, but it is not possible to resolve it quickly without 40 million yen. Although the current financial situation is worrying, if we try our best to save money, the country will not be in danger because of these 40 million yen. The intention is to ease the Finance Minister's mind and seek a solution. There is no other way. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito visited the Finance Minister early in the morning on the 1st and talked about the seriousness of the situation, hoping to ease his mind to deal with it. The Finance Minister then explained the current financial situation in detail and hoped that the Prime Minister would restrain the cabinet members and find a way to rescue the financial crisis. Prime Minister Saito felt it was difficult and left angrily. The budget cabinet meeting will be postponed to the 2nd to avoid a head-on collision at the cabinet meeting. After the cabinet meeting closed around 11:00 AM, each cabinet member discussed again to find a way to break the deadlock, but there was no progress. The Finance Minister and the Navy and Agriculture Ministers have become opposing sides. With this development of the political situation, the future impact is very great. At noon that day, Army Minister Araki met with the Finance Minister in another room and also talked about the importance of the situation, hoping to ease his mind, but the Finance Minister was still as strong as ever and did not talk about the intention of making concessions. It can be seen that the case is still in a stalemate. Prime Minister Saito is currently discussing with Chief Secretary Horikiri how to overcome the difficulties. His painstaking efforts are very urgent. If the Finance Minister cannot ease up a little, it will be difficult to see a bright future. The attitude of the Finance Minister and the Navy Minister will be the key to determining future problems. (Nichiren Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Goto Denies Resignation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - Agriculture Minister Goto, who was rumored to be resigning, denied it at his official residence last night, saying, "I have no intention of resigning. Where did this rumor come from? It's unfounded. The budget cabinet meeting has not yet finished. I will make a final effort for the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. At the cabinet meeting tomorrow, I will fully express my opinions. In short, I hope that the budget will be resolved satisfactorily from a macro perspective. I cannot talk about resigning or not resigning at the moment." (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>United States Expands Navy, Britain Need Not Worry; US Ambassador Bingham Hints</h3>
<p>(London) - US Ambassador to Britain Bingham, when speaking at a Thanksgiving banquet at the American Club today, mentioned the US naval construction plan, and asked that, in his opinion, if the people of the US and Britain could know each other well, it would never cause anxiety. In this eventful world, the most thankful thing to God is that the two great democracies of Britain and the United States only want to seek peace, and have no hostile acts or aggressive intentions towards any country. US Ambassador Bingham strongly defended the monetary policies of Britain and the US before and after abandoning the gold standard, and said that the US had sincere reasons for giving thanks at this time. In a country where industry was stagnant, banks were shaking, and the people were on the verge of disappointment, the entire situation had changed dramatically in a few months and presented a prosperous image. The anxiety of the past has turned into hope and courage, and various indicators have improved and are moving towards the restoration of past prosperity. He is sure that anyone who shorts the US will end up in trouble. Bingham also described the steps taken by President Roosevelt and the US government to overcome the forces of recession, saying that Britain's abandonment of the gold standard had good results, as had the US. The reasons for abandoning the gold standard were the same for both countries. The difference is that the US abandoned the gold standard before the gold reserves were completely exhausted. Britain established an exchange equalization fund, which is indeed a good strategy, and the operation of this fund is also very appropriate. He hopes that the operation of the same fund in the US will also be as beneficial as in Britain. He is also not worried about the US having unlimited expansion, just as he is not worried about Britain having it. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The statement made by US Ambassador to Britain Bingham at the American Club in London that the US also has an exchange equalization fund is quite baffling to the officialdom here. What Bingham called the US exchange equalization fund probably refers to the 50 million yuan used by the Finance Rehabilitation Agency to purchase new ore gold. Officials here say that this is the only thing that is slightly similar to the British equalization fund, but the amount and purpose are different, so it is difficult to compare them. The London Financial Times said that the statement made by US Ambassador Bingham that the US fund is operating perfectly seems to have no factual support. The name of this song fund is probably wrong. What he calls the fund is probably an exchange devaluation fund. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)</p>

<h3>Powerful Nations Uphold Justice; French Army Chief's Speech About Blind Faith in Military Force</h3>
<p>(Paris) - A public banquet was held by the military press this afternoon, chaired by Dalaier. After the closing of the banquet, Dalaier issued a statement, saying that countries around the world have accused France of being imperialist. This kind of argument is absurd and superficial. Dalaier concluded by saying, "Some people say that France's current strength cannot independently protect its freedom. This kind of argument is even more absurd. Our French power is enough to protect the French people and give them the right to seek a just and free life based on the spirit of justice. This spirit of justice is inherent in the relations between nations. Although we take justice as our goal, we must also take necessary measures to protect the integrity of our territory. However, we believe that strong force should be used to uphold justice, otherwise, even if there is strong force, it will lose its effectiveness." (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>France Does Not Want to Return the Saar Region Before 1935</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Hitler recently expressed the opinion that the Saar region should be returned to Germany unconditionally. The French House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on this matter, chaired by Herriot, and passed a resolution, advocating that the return of the region should not be considered before the 1935 referendum. A press release was then issued, stating that the purpose of this resolution was to make the government pay attention to the need to consult with the League of Nations to protect treaty rights and the complete freedom of the referendum. According to the treaty, voters must have been residing in the Saar region since 1919 and be at least 20 years old, while Germans who have moved to the region since that year are not allowed to express their opinions. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>

Although the Social Democratic Party members expressed their support, the Senate ultimately expressed their disapproval with a majority of 23 votes to 11. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>US Cotton Sold to Japan in Large Quantities; Preparing for War by Manufacturing Gunpowder?</h3>
<p>(Washington) - Cotton expert Johnson of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration said today, based on the rate of exporting 3.5 million bales in four months, that the United States will be able to export 10 million bales in the entire export season, ranking second in the amount of exports in previous years. At the same time, the Department of Agriculture announced that the amount of cotton exported to Japan at the beginning of this season is unprecedented, so there is a saying that Japan is buying cotton to prepare for war. However, according to Johnson, almost all of the American cotton purchased by Japan is ordinary high-quality cotton used for weaving cloth, while cotton for making gunpowder is usually of lower quality.

<h3>Fascistization of Czechoslovakia and Estonia; Seen as a Sign of European Crisis; Russian Newspapers Spare No Effort in Criticism</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - Soviet newspapers have recently spared no effort in attacking the prevalence of fascism in various European countries. The first attack was on Estonia's constitution after it was altered by nationalists. Recently, Czechoslovakia has also shown a tendency towards fascistization, so Soviet newspapers have shifted their target to attack Czechoslovakia. Today, the Soviet government's organ Pravda published an article attacking the Czechoslovak government's promulgation of new decrees prohibiting certain political organizations, claiming that the fascistization of Czechoslovakia is a sign of the seriousness of the European crisis, because the petty-bourgeois Democratic Party has begun to court fascism, and the Social Democratic Party has followed suit without hesitation. Therefore, today's Social Democratic Party in Czechoslovakia has openly appointed itself as a facilitator of fascism. Their actions clearly indicate their purpose in disarming the proletarian vanguard, that is, the Communist Party. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Romania Celebrates the Anniversary of the Expansion of Its Territory</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Romania celebrated the 15th anniversary of the incorporation of Outer Transylvania into Romania today. (Note: Outer Transylvania was originally part of the old Austro-Hungarian territory and was ceded to Romania after the end of the Great War in 1918.) The "World News" newspaper here specially published a short article written by Foreign Minister Titulescu, which said: "Our country's national unity is the result of hundreds of years of suffering and injustice. If anyone tries to change our existing borders, then logically speaking, it must not be allowed by law and justice, and in terms of strength, our country's military power will also be able to resist it."

<h3>Hereditary Diseases Endanger Society; Eliminate Reproductive Function; Danzig Promulgates New Law to Be Implemented Next Year</h3>
<p>Danzig - The National Socialist government of the Free City of Danzig issued an order stipulating that from January 1st next year, the "Elimination of Reproductive Function" law will be implemented throughout Danzig. Anyone suffering from a hereditary disease that is harmful to society or incompatible with social life may be considered by the judicial authorities to implement this law in each case. When the court makes a decision, spectators are prohibited, but the law does not provide for the elimination of the reproductive function of those who are abnormal in sexual matters. This is the only point that differs from German law. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>

<h3>Russian Foreign Minister Moves Eastward to Istanbul; Expected to Arrive in Italy Today; Wireless Message Broadcast from Ship States: Willing to Accept Any Proposal Beneficial to European Peace; Vatican to Propose to Russia to Restore Freedom of Religious Belief</h3>
<p>Rome - Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will arrive in Naples this Saturday. After landing, he will go to Rome, stay at the Russian Embassy, and will attend the welcome banquet at the US Embassy. According to a wireless message broadcast from the ship on which Litvinov is traveling, Litvinov is keeping silent on the issues to be discussed in Rome, but according to members of the Soviet Russian delegation, Litvinov is willing to accept any proposal that is effective in disarmament and can improve relations between European powers, and does not want to hear about other matters. It is believed that the Vatican may take the opportunity of Litvinov's visit to Rome to propose to him that Soviet Russia should allow freedom of religious belief. The relationship between Soviet Russia and the Vatican has always been extremely tense, but this time the Vatican believes that the time is ripe for improving relations between Soviet Russia and the Vatican because the attitude of Soviet Russia is gradually becoming milder. As for whether this proposal will be made directly by the Vatican or indirectly by the Italian government, no official documents have been released. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>

<h3>Roman Newspapers Awaken Russia's Old Faith</h3>
<p>Rome - The Catholic organ "Italian Future News" published an article entitled "Moscow and Rome," explaining how Soviet Russia is striving to re-participate in European and world politics, and believes that the upcoming meeting between Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and Prime Minister Mussolini is another proof of Soviet Russia's contact with Western countries. The newspaper also hopes that this kind of contact can awaken the religious ideas of the Soviet Russian people. It said, "The treasure of the spirit and religion was stupidly destroyed by the Soviet system. There are now millions of believers praying to God, hoping that after the contact between Soviet Russia and Western countries, it can have a considerable influence to restore this treasure. We also hope that Catholic doctrines can regain their due position in Soviet Russia. In Soviet Russia, only Rome can awaken the old faith. All permanent sources of civilized progress should be sought in Rome, and Rome does not depend on other countries. Litvinov is familiar with world history and must be able to believe in this level."

<h3>Increasing Opposition to U.S. Monetary Policy; Impacting Government Trade Policy; To Be Subjected to "Dual Attack" in Congress; Smith Writes Article Mocking Government; New Deal Agencies Resemble Word Puzzle Games; Organization Cumbersome, Top-Heavy and Inefficient</h3>
<p>(Washington) Observers predict that due to the growing dissatisfaction with the US President's monetary policy, the government's reciprocal tariff policy may also be subject to political attacks in the next Congress. If the President requests to expand his authority to negotiate with other countries, his monetary and trade policies may face a "dual attack" in Congress. (National News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) After being criticized for his recent attacks on the US President's monetary policy, Smith, a prominent figure in the US Democratic Party, wrote an article in the magazine "New Outlook," which he edits, attacking the government's relief, economic, and monetary policies. He claimed that if the desire is to have more public works projects underway by February 15th of next year, the Public Works Administration must be completely reorganized immediately. He also pointed out that the government's newly established Civil Works Administration, intended to accommodate four million unemployed workers this winter, is merely an attempt to cover up the failures of the Public Works Administration. He criticized the cumbersome and inconvenient organization of the Public Works Administration, describing it as top-heavy, inefficient in its paperwork and meetings, and lacking effectiveness in implementation. In addition, he listed the government's New Deal agencies such as AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Administration), NRA (National Recovery Administration), PWA (Public Works Administration), CWA (Civil Works Administration), FCA (Farm Credit Administration), RFC (Reconstruction Finance Corporation), and other agencies, mocking the government by saying it resembles heartless professors in the government, playing word puzzle games with inverted letters.

<p>(Washington) Following Smith's attack on the government, Secretary of the Interior Ickes today criticized him for becoming increasingly resentful due to unfulfilled ambitions and disappointment, causing his judgment to be obscured by his hatred of the government.

In addition, Father Coughlin of Detroit, who had previously criticized Smith's attack on the government's monetary policy as being influenced by loans from banker Morgan, reiterated his statement in Detroit yesterday after Smith issued a clarification.

<h3>U.S. Fears Soviet Competition in International Petroleum Trade</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States' recognition of the Soviet Union has sparked speculation among the national petroleum industry about the future impact on international petroleum trade. The United States accounts for the first largest oil production in the world, and the Soviet Union the second, with the two countries accounting for 72% of the world's oil production. If they can act jointly, it will have a significant impact on future efforts to stabilize the world oil market. However, it is expected that after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet Union will resume purchasing oil exploration and refining machinery from the United States, increase its oil production, and aggressively promote sales in the Far East and South America, leading to fierce competition with American oil.

<h3>Yang Shukan and Others Request Cancellation of Additional Tax on Sichuan Salt Sold to Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Members of the Central Committee Yang Shukan, Xie Chi, and Huang Fusheng, among others, sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 29th regarding the additional tax on Sichuan salt sold to Hubei, requesting the withdrawal of the order. The original telegram stated that the Sichuan Salt Guilds of Shashi and Yichang, as well as the Sichuan salt representatives, reported that according to the General Office's telegram, an additional tax of $1.50 per dan has been added to Sichuan salt transported to western Hubei and northern Chu, bringing the total tax on Sichuan salt to as much as nine yuan per dan, which is already a heavy burden. If the tax is further increased, it may be unbearable. Moreover, China's salt tax has always been differentiated, considering the weight of the salt capital to determine the level of tax, to adjust its fairness. Now, the tax on sales to Hubei and Chu is uniquely increased, making it even heavier and more difficult to bear. Salt is a daily necessity and is different from other consumer luxury goods. Please consider the suffering of the people of Sichuan and Chu, who have repeatedly suffered from floods, bandits, wars, and earthquakes, and have nowhere to turn, and grant the withdrawal of the order to eliminate the source of chaos and quell the disputes. Please also send a telegram to that effect. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Currently Planning Estate Tax Law; Investigation Work Quite Tricky</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has ordered the Tax Bureau to draft a plan for the implementation of an estate tax. Minister Kong stated that the estate tax is one of the best sources of tax revenue, and most countries in the world have already implemented it. In this time of financial difficulty in our country, we should naturally also implement an estate tax. The Ministry is currently planning the estate tax law. After it is passed by the Central Government, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan to instruct the Financial Committee of the Yuan to study and draft it. According to foreign advisors, the prerequisite for the estate tax is to adjust the census and investigate the people's actual property. Because in recent years, those with strong capital mostly reside in Shanghai and deposit their money in foreign banks, the investigation work is quite tricky. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Rescue of the Cotton Yarn and Textile Industry Under Consideration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of government assistance for the cotton yarn and textile industry was submitted to the Rural Reconstruction Commission by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and it was decided that the government should negotiate with government-run banks to provide a low-interest loan of 20 million yuan for assistance. This has been delayed until now and has not yet been completed. It has recently been heard that the plan has been returned to the National Economic Council and the Cotton Industry Control Committee for unified handling. According to Liu Yinqin, a member of the committee, the Cotton Industry Control Committee is still planning to allocate 20 million yuan to assist the cotton yarn and textile industry. However, the reasons for the decline of each cotton mill are different, and in-depth research is needed before assistance can be provided. Otherwise, if the root cause is not removed, temporary maintenance will have no hope of development in the future. Fundamental improvements are necessary for any effective result. At present, all measures are still under consideration, and Chen Guangfu is responsible for raising funds. It is also planned that, under the guidance of the Control Committee, the factories will jointly form a joint cotton yarn sales organization in Shanghai to avoid jealousy among the industry.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Investigates Reed Salt and Native Niter</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance instructed the Changlu Salt Transportation Envoy that there are two types of native niter produced in the area, land-produced and sea-produced. According to a previous report from the Jingqian Transportation Envoy, beach-produced niter is currently managed by the Niter Bureau. The Ministry requested instructions on whether land-produced native niter should be allowed to be manufactured and sold. After investigation, there are three types of land-produced native niter in chemistry: one is potassium nitrate, which is gunpowder; the second is sodium nitrate, which is Chilean nitrate, which can be used as a raw material for gunpowder and belongs to the scope of niter mines, which should be strictly managed by the Niter Mine Bureau; the third is sodium sulfate, which is refined land niter and is mirabilite, which is currently not managed. However, beach-produced sea niter is also sodium sulfate and is currently managed by the Niter Bureau. The actual annual production of sodium sulfate, one type of land-produced native niter, in the area, and whether it has any relationship with salt affairs and niter affairs, and whether it should be managed in the same way as sea-produced native niter, should be carefully investigated by the transportation envoy for approval.

<h3>Chiang Orders Pacification and Relief for People in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Since the encirclement and suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, due to the shortage of materials, panic has broken out internally. The bandit government, unable to do anything, incited poor peasants to search the homes of middle peasants and launched a "check" campaign, using poor peasants to strike down middle peasants, with the aim of mutual destruction. As a result, the morale of the people in the bandit areas has been fundamentally shaken. After receiving the report, Chiang ordered the provincial government to instruct the counties to find ways to pacify and relieve the people in the bandit areas. (Central News Agency, 1st)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Telegram to all newspapers: Recently, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission sent a telegram, which reads: "I have read the Central Executive Committee's telegram. The suppression of bandits in Jiangxi is seeing victory, and eradication is foreseeable. However, Chen Mingshu and others have suddenly launched a rebellion at this time. All military and political agencies should quickly deal with it." Also, I received your telegram, which reads: "The rebel troops should follow the original plan and continue to suppress them as usual. Not only should there be no doubts due to the Fujian Incident, but we should also take advantage of the Fujian Incident to accelerate the action." I and others are soldiers with the duty of defense and should obey and follow. However, considering the serious national crisis and the thread of national vitality, we are working hard to save the situation. Chen Mingshu and others dare to raise troops and rebel, illegally claim titles, and implement collusion with the communists and enemy, destroying the party and betraying the country, assisting the bandits, reigniting the dying embers of the Red Army, and opening the door to foreign aggression. Such insane and reckless behavior is the public enemy of the nation and the criminals of the people. I request that Chairman Chiang promptly implement the strategies determined by the Central Committee, publicly denounce and severely punish them to maintain discipline and protect the foundation of the country. I and others are ready to fight and vow to be in the vanguard. I respectfully submit this telegram and ask for your consideration."

<h3>Correspondence: Correspondence from the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Dear Sir: The reason why the Director of this department, Xie, recently urgently telegraphed to return home was due to his wife's serious illness, which was approved by Minister Kong for a two-week leave to return to his hometown to take care of family affairs. He has no other mission. Today, I read in this month's 1st issue of the Pictorial that the Ministry of Finance specially dispatched Director Xie Qi to go to Guangdong to take charge of the foreign rice tax collection case near the border. This is inconsistent with the facts. Fearing that the mistake will be spread, I am corresponding with you to request a speedy correction. Sincerely, General Affairs Section, Taxation Department, Ministry of Finance, December 1st.</p>
<h3>After the Fujian Incident, Chairman Chiang Still Pays Attention to Bandit Suppression; Armies in Eastern Jiangxi Still Follow Original Plans</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Fujian Incident has now moved towards a military resolution. The eastern part of Jiangxi has the longest border with Fujian. However, the border area which connects Tingzhou, Liancheng Jianning, Ninghua, Guangze, Shaowu, Chong'an, Ruijin, Guangchang, Nanfeng, Nancheng, Lichuan, Zixi, Qianshan and other counties are all occupied by bandits and deeply radicalized. The Fujian side used it as a barrier, but although there are hundreds of thousands of central army troops in eastern Jiangxi, they were unable to directly attack due to not wanting to harm the citizens. Therefore, the armies in eastern Jiangxi still follow their original plan of suppressing the bandits. Moreover, in recent days, due to the urgent situation in Fujian and Zhejiang, the bandits thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it and tried to advance from Jinxi towards Fuzhou and Dongxiang in the north. Chiang saw this as a good opportunity to quickly eliminate the bandits, so he personally directed everything. At the same time, he ordered the Provincial Government to strictly enforce the 40-odd counties along the Fuhe and Jianhe rivers in Jiangxi, requiring them to complete the blockhouse projects in counties, cities, towns, and traffic arteries within a month to strengthen defenses and prevent any loopholes. Chiang is extremely busy working in Fuzhou. Important figures such as Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Zhenlin Zhiyuan, and Lu Xingrong, who came to the province for instructions, took the Jiangxi-Fujian Road bus to Fuzhou to visit Chiang. Rumors that Chiang will go to Nanjing or Zhejiang are inaccurate. (November 29th)</p>
<h3>He Gonggan Assumes the Position of Fujian Provincial Governor; All Provincial Agencies Undergo Organizational Changes; Educational Funding Fundamentally Shaken</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After He Gonggan was appointed Governor of Fujian Province by the People's Government, he took office on the 25th in the old Provincial Government Auditorium. There was initially a proposal to divide Fujian Province into two or three provinces, but this has been cancelled. The provincial system is currently being drafted by He. As for its organization, it has been decided to abolish the two departments and establish sections, a total of five sections. The selection of section chiefs has been approved by He. Ruan Shuqing was appointed as Secretary-General and concurrently as the head of the Civil Affairs Section, Qian Luzhou (i.e., Qian Zongqi) was appointed as the head of the General Affairs Section, Li Ruozhu was appointed as the head of the Education Section, Liu Mianyi (i.e., Liu Pinye) was appointed as the head of the Economic Section, and Li Bo was appointed as the head of the Finance Section. On the 26th, the new provincial government began to operate, with its office located at the former site of the Department of Civil Affairs. Among the five section chiefs, only Qian Luzhou was unable to come due to illness in Shanghai and was temporarily replaced by Wang Buai. The rest all took office at the same time. The takeover procedures for the various departments are being handled separately these days. In addition to the Department of Civil Affairs, which has already been taken over immediately, the archives of the Department of Education were taken over by Li Ruozhu on the 26th. Its office was changed to the Cultural Committee. The archives of the Department of Construction were not taken over by Liu Mianyi until the 27th. Shanghai Chezhi is the Economic Committee, and the Department of Finance took until the 28th to divide due to the issue of national tax revenue, after He negotiated with Jiang Guangnai, Zha Xiqing, and others. All special taxes belong to the Ministry of Finance, while the rest belongs to the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The new provincial government has extremely thin regulations. In addition to the governor, who receives 200 yuan per month, the section chiefs receive 80 yuan per month, and the section staff are divided into four grades: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 40 yuan, and 50 yuan. The new provincial government's facilities and policies have not yet been announced, but it is heard that He Gonggan has ordered the Civil Affairs Section to assess the political achievements of the county chiefs. There will be a round of appointments and removals in the near future.</p>
<p>Regarding the education policy, there has recently been a proposal to abolish ordinary middle schools and replace them with vocational schools. However, educational funding has been fundamentally shaken. The funding for teachers in Fujian Province was originally 120,000 yuan from the salt surtax. Since the recent changes in the situation, the salt affairs in northern Fujian have completely stopped, the salt tax revenue is minimal, and the education has been unable to allocate it. The educational circles sent a letter to He Gonggan and Jiang Guangnai on the 27th, requesting relief. He presented it to the People's Government meeting on the 27th for discussion, and it was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Committee for joint fundraising and relief. He Gonggan talked to the education circle, saying that the educational funding must be guaranteed, but if the salt affairs do not develop, then it will be too difficult to restore the education funding to its original state.

<h3>Huang Qixiang Has Not Separated from the Third Party; The People's Daily Denies Huang's Telegram Announcing Departure; The People's Revolutionary Grand Alliance Has Not Begun to Organize</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the establishment of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, Jiang Guangnai, Li Guangda, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Li Jishen, and others first issued a telegram declaring their separation from the Kuomintang. Subsequently, Shen Guanghan and others also telegraphed their departure from the party a few days later. When Jiang, Cai, and others issued their telegrams, Fuzhou newspapers once published that Huang Qixiang had also telegraphed his separation from the Third Party. It was also heard that the People's Revolutionary Grand Alliance would be established above the government to supervise the administrative organs. Now, according to the Fuzhou People's Daily (formerly the Republic Daily), a special announcement has been published regarding Huang Qixiang's departure from the Second Party, stating that Huang did not send such a telegram, and the People's Revolutionary Grand Alliance has not yet begun to organize.

<h3>Bai Yuhuan Was Assassinated in Tianjin; Bai Usually Vigorously Criticized Party Rule; This Assassination Is Suspected to Have Political Background</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Last night (around 7 p.m. on the 28th), an assassination case suddenly occurred in Gengyu Lane, Akashi Street, Japanese Concession. The victim was Bai Yuhuan, who resided at No. 2 in the lane. It is reported that the assassins who entered Bai's residence were three young men. Bai was shot three times, all with Browning pistol bullets. After firing the shots, the three men fled in a hurry. The Japanese police station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched Japanese police and plainclothes detectives to surround the Akashi Street area and conduct a search. By that time, the assassins had already escaped. Special agents entered Bai's residence to investigate and found that Bai's left arm was injured by three shots. He was immediately carried to Yan Gu Hospital on Naniwa Street for washing and treatment. However, due to Bai's advanced age (58 years old this year), he suffered great damage to his spirit and body from this attack and shock. Bai was from Tianmen County, Hubei Province. In his early years, he ran around to make revolution with Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, and others. Later, Sun and Huang disagreed, and Bai joined Huang and others in the same revolutionary cause. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Bai was incompatible with the Kuomintang. In the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, he lived in Japan, publishing the magazine "Republic of China," criticizing party rule with fierce words, and secretly running a party with Chen Jiongming and others, criticizing the Kuomintang. Last year, Bai came to Tianjin with Chen Jiongming to engage in activities and established the Zhen Bao in the Japanese Concession, with Bai as the chief writer. After Chen Jiongming returned to Hong Kong this year, he passed away in Hong Kong. Bai stayed in Tianjin. Because Zhen Bao was banned, it was renamed Zhen Bao, with an editorial department and business department set up on Suma Street. Bai resided at No. 2 Gengyu Lane. Recently, after the Fujian Incident, Bai wrote articles supporting the People's Government. Last night, after dinner at his residence, he was about to go out for a bath when three young men suddenly broke in. Before he could speak, he was attacked and immediately fell to the ground. The perpetrators fled. The Japanese police station is currently investigating the political background of the assassins and actively pursuing the culprits.</p>
<p>According to another report, Bai Yuhuan was the leader of the United Democratic Socialist Party. At 10 a.m. yesterday, two young men in Western suits (both around 24 or 25 years old) broke into Bai's residence, claiming to buy newspapers. Then they went to No. 8 Gengyu Lane to look at the house. Bai's attendants, seeing that the two men looked suspicious, told Bai to prepare for precautions. Unexpectedly, at about 7 p.m. that night, three young men in Western suits suddenly came, each holding a pistol. One of them first restrained the servants downstairs, and the other two went upstairs to search. At that time, Bai was taking a bath and saw two men pointing guns at him. Knowing they were not good people, he jumped up and grabbed the person in front of him. The person behind him shot Bai three times in a row. Bai suffered severe injuries to his chest and arms and bled a lot. The attendants rushed over at the sound, and Bai lay in a pool of blood. The assassins all fled. The Japanese police station sent people to investigate and ordered people to send Bai to the hospital, while trying to detect the culprits. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the injury was too serious, and his life was in great danger. (November 29)</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui Is Immersed in Scholarship in Europe; He Has No Intention of Returning Home Recently</h3>
<p>Beijing News: Former Fourth Army Commander Zhang Fakui, since resigning and going to Europe, has been immersed in scholarship in preparation for serving the party and the country in the future. There was a previous rumor that Zhang was about to return home. Yesterday, according to reliable sources, Zhang is still in London, studying political economy. Recently, friends reported that he described his research plans and interests in Europe, and did not mention the issue of returning home. The previous rumors prove that the news of Zhang's return to China was indeed an exaggeration. Perhaps it was because the situation had changed again, and it was thought that Zhang would definitely rise again, but in fact, it was just rumors.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial People's Congress; Five Proposals Passed on the Spot</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Hubei Provincial People's Congress was held at the Yue Ma Chang in Wuchang at 9 a.m. on the 30th. Officials from various agencies and organizations, students from various schools, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 20,000 people, attended the meeting. He Chenjun, Ye Peng, Wang Shiliu, Cheng Qibao, and others were elected to the presidium, with Wang Shiliu as the general chairman. He reported the significance of the meeting. Ye Peng, the representative of the military, Cheng Qibao, the representative of the political circles, Yang Xingqin, the municipal party committee, Lu Jian, the representative of the academic circles, Ai Yuying, the representative of the press, Duan Gongshuang, the representative of the labor circles, and Zhou Zhenyu, the representative of the business circles, successively gave speeches, and then announced the proposals: (1) Declaration of the Congress; (2) Telegraphing the Central Party Department to order the National Government to issue a clear order to punish the rebellious Fujian Province; (3) Telegraphing the whole country to unanimously condemn the rebellious Fujian Province; (4) Warning the 19th Route Army to maintain its past glory, quickly correct the chaos, and eliminate the pseudo-organization; (5) Requesting the military and police organs of this province to strictly investigate and arrest the anti-rebellion elements who are lurking and active. The following is a record of the Central Committee, the General Headquarters, the Pacification Office, and three telegrams to Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai: (1) Telegram to the Central Committee, "To the Central Party Department, In recent years, the country has been plagued by many disasters. Internally, the Red Bandits have been rampant, and externally, strong neighbors have been oppressing us. All Chinese people should be aware of the danger of stacked eggs and strive to help each other with the will to support each other. Sincere unity is needed to save the country from danger. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, using false names, started chaos in Fujian, recruited all reactionary elements, claiming to be representatives of the masses, and arbitrarily formed a pseudo-government, changing the flag and colluding with the Jiangxi Red Bandits to form a military agreement, colluding with each other. They also flattered and courted Japanese imperialists, secretly colluding with each other, not hesitating to help the bandits to disturb the people and invite foreign bandits to overthrow the capital. Judging from their intentions, they want to use the nation that the martyrs painstakingly created to satisfy their personal desires to seize power. After hearing this, we feel extremely hateful. The people of this province, on November 30, held a people's congress and unanimously decided to appeal to your meeting to instruct the National Government to issue a clear order to launch a large-scale attack to lay the foundation of the country and curb the chaos. The future of the party and the country depends on it. The Hubei People's Congress for Punishing Rebellion Koupian." (2) Telegram to the General Headquarters, the Pacification Office, and the Police Department, "To the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in the Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the Pacification Commissioner's Office stationed in Hubei, and the Wuhan Garrison Command, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have changed the era name, usurped the throne, and betrayed the central government. Their crimes are obvious, and the whole country is indignant. For the sake of upholding justice, the people of this province held a people's congress to punish rebellion at the Yue Ma Chang in Wuchang on November 30 and proposed that the military and police organs of this province strictly investigate and arrest anti-rebellion elements lurking and active in Wuhan. This was unanimously approved by the whole body. Wuhan is an important town on the Yangtze River, and it is inevitable that anti-rebellion elements will lurk and be active. If they are not strictly investigated and arrested, it may hinder public security. In addition to sending telegrams, we hereby send a telegram to earnestly request strict enforcement to pacify the people. Deeply praying, the Hubei People's Congress for Punishing Rebellion respectfully seals the telegram on the 30th of November." (3) Telegram to Jiang Cai, "To Chairman Jiang Guangnai of Fuzhou and Director Cai Tingkai, In recent years, foreign troubles and bandit chaos have been intertwined, and the survival of the country is imminent. All Chinese people should be inspired by nature and conscience and work together to save the situation. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, disregarding the overall situation, started chaos in Fujian, arbitrarily established names, and organized a government, colluding with the Communist bandits and betraying the party and the country. Their crimes are heinous, and the whole country is indignant. Recalling the telegram of the 19th Route Army withdrawing from Shanghai, it was declared that they would never participate in civil wars. Unexpectedly, this time they abandoned their glorious history and betrayed their past oaths, foolishly providing Chen and other rebels with the opportunity to use them to launch a civil war. When the news came, we were extremely surprised. The people of this province, indignant at Chen Mingshu and others for harming the country and the people, specially held a people's congress to punish rebellion on November 30 and unanimously decided to warn the 19th Route Army to maintain its past glory, quickly correct the chaos, and eliminate the pseudo-organization. This congress, for the sake of cherishing the past reputation of you two gentlemen, does not hesitate to make a final loyal admonition. We deeply hope that you will come to your senses, abide by the intentions of the central government, disband the pseudo-government in Fujian Province, and bring the main rebels to justice. It is not too late to turn back, do not miss the opportunity. This telegram is respectfully delivered, and we hope you will understand. The Hubei People's Congress for Punishing Rebellion respectfully seals the telegram on the 30th of November." (November 30)</p>

They were selected and appointed by the Department of Finance and distributed to various counties to take up their duties.

<h3>Injured from Jumping Out of a Covered Wagon</h3>
<p>Last night (30th), a person dressed as a soldier jumped out of a special train from Shanghai to Hangzhou. His head, feet, and buttocks were seriously injured. The train was still unaware and drove straight on. He was then carried to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his life is not in danger. He was also asked that he was a soldier of the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Replenishment Regiment of the Military and Political Department, who had departed from Wuchang to Hangzhou, but he refused to tell his name.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Xishan Township, Suzhou</h3>
<p>At about 10 p.m. on the 30th, more than ten bandits suddenly came to He Yansheng's house in Lujia Village, Xishan Township, Dongting, and robbed them, losing about 200 yuan. He Zidaogen and the long-term worker Zhu were kidnapped. At noon the next day, the long-term worker Zhu was released and brought back a note, limiting the ransom to 5,000 yuan within three days at a place near the Ting Shang Bridge in Dongshan to redeem He Zidaogen. Now, the family is extremely anxious because of the difficulty in raising money.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Li Tongfeng Mixed and Sold Fake Ginseng and Disputes; Li Tongfeng Ginseng Medicine System in Shuyuan Lane in the City</h3>
<p>Li Yunquan, a local, has been running the business for more than ten years with his own funds. The business is normal. This year, in order to attract customers and promote business, he purchased two Taiwanese gray deer (each costing only a few angles per catty) and falsely posed them as Northeast sika deer (with red hair and plum blossom white spots, each costing about eight or nine hundred yuan). In mid-month, he held a deer slaughter ceremony, jointly making nine whole deer. At the same time, he extensively published advertisements in the local newspaper, spreading the word that all kinds of ginseng and medicine sold were at the expense of blood. But the day before yesterday, a man named Chen Yingen from Tangkou bought a package of real American ginseng from the store and found on the spot that it was counterfeit. As a result, a dispute arose, and they twisted each other to the first sub-bureau of public security. After questioning by Officer Qin, he ordered Li Hanxian, a partner of the store, to pay a bail and wait to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation, and at the same time sent a letter to the Pharmaceutical Association to identify the authenticity for verification. Then, according to the Pharmaceutical Association's reply, Li Hanxian, a partner of the store, claimed that it was a defective product of the store, and it was considered unnecessary to identify it. Then the store hired a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper and automatically convened a temporary meeting of the Pharmaceutical Association to identify it, but only seven or eight non-committee members arrived on the day and held a meeting at the Yaowang Temple. At the same time, the first sub-bureau was notified by telephone to send a package of ginseng to the meeting for identification, but all the executive and supervisory committee members of the Pharmaceutical Association believed that the store had illegally convened the meeting and there was no need to attend, so they ignored it. Yesterday, the Pharmaceutical Association received another letter from a gentleman from the noodle industry, sending a package of ginseng, saying that it was also purchased from Li Tongfeng and was a fake product and an inferior product, requesting identification. According to people in the pharmaceutical industry, real American ginseng sold on the market costs 167 yuan per two, but the so-called real American ginseng sold by the store costs 4 yuan per two. Regardless of its authenticity, even according to the store clerk's own admission that it is a defective product, it is already a substandard medicine, similar to fraudulent behavior. In addition, there is also a kind of artificially cultivated Oriental ginseng that is very easy to distinguish, and it is known to be an inferior product at a glance. The pharmacies in this city never use it, because according to the pharmaceutical business regulations, the ginseng and medicine used are related to people's lives, and all must use top-grade genuine goods. Substandard second-grade goods are all subject to crackdown. As for the package of American ginseng sold by Li Tongfeng this time, the association is reluctant to be responsible for certification because it is a matter of friendship with the same industry. However, now that it has been transferred to the court for interrogation, it can only wait quietly for the court's judgment. If the court requests identification in the future, it can only handle it impartially and not want to be biased and deceive oneself and others.</p>
<h3>Xintangli Robbery</h3>
<p>Wu Shutang, a resident of Xintangli, the fifth district of the county, has some assets. Yesterday was the wedding of his son Xifang. The day before yesterday, he hosted a banquet for guests.

County Magistrate Ruan left without result, and then went to the West Township Office, where he also failed to take over. He immediately reported to the province for verification.</p>
<h3>Large Fire in West Street, Nantong City</h3>
<p>West Street in Tongcheng is a bustling commercial area and the essence of the city. At about 2 a.m. on the 30th, a fire suddenly broke out in the Jingfuzhai Food Store, and in an instant, it spread to 17 stores, including Fuji Cloth Store, Yuyuan Clock Store, and Sino-British Pharmacy. The entire central section was turned to ashes. The fire was completely extinguished at noon, and the loss was in the range of 500,000 yuan, which is a catastrophic robbery unprecedented in this city. As for the cause of the fire, it was caused by a short circuit in the electric lights of the store. The stone archway in the central market of West Street was also burned down, and the stone pillars were broken.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Police Team Arrests a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhu Hua, the captain of the police team in this county, was ordered a few days ago to lead the police to Luyang Lake to suppress bandits. However, the bandits in that area fled to the northeast township of Caodang after hearing the news. Captain Zhu led the team to chase them to Ku Zuan and Guan Zuan, and sent the leaders of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th squads to suppress them in different ways. A few days ago, in the Caodang near Gezhuang, they caught sight of a bandit ship and surrounded and arrested five bandits, including Lu Yunlin, Lu Yunshan, Wu Guangsheng, Yang Zengshun, and Yang Shixiang, and killed one bandit, Gu Yankai, and rescued four female hostages and eight men and women children, and seized a bandit ship, a Mauser rifle, and more than ten bullets. They were released from the team last night (28th) and plan to transfer them to the county government today (29th) for investigation.</p>

<h3>Local News: Fujian-Zhejiang Border Has Not Been Engaged; Shanghai-Fujian Telegraph Line Remains Open</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports: Recently, there have been widespread rumors in Shanghai that Fujian troops have clashed with Zhejiang forces near the Xianxia Ridge. However, the central army units under Liu Heding and Zhou Hunyuan are all stationed in northern Fujian. If the 19th Route Army intends to advance north, it would be difficult for them to reach the base of Xianxia Ridge directly. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Fuzhou telegraph line passes through Jiangshan in Zhejiang, across Xianxia Ridge, and south to Pucheng. If hostilities were to occur, the telegraph line would inevitably be cut. As the Shanghai-Fuzhou telegraph line remains open, it is evident that the rumors of engagement are entirely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Visitor from Pingyang Discusses: Wenzhou and Ruian Areas are Peaceful; However, Shipments from Shanghai Have Sharply Decreased</h3>
<p>Pingyang, in the Wenzhou prefecture of Zhejiang, borders Fujian province. Since the Fujian Incident, merchants from Pingyang have mostly stopped trading. Yesterday, the Xinruiping vessel of the Shanghai Huxing Company arrived in Shanghai from Pingyang. Our reporter made a special trip to the vessel to inquire about the situation. The obtained information is detailed below:</p>
<h3>Peace in Pingyang</h3>
<p>The Xinruiping vessel specializes in the Shanghai-Ruian-Pingyang route. It arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday, docking in the Nanshi district. The vessel was heavily loaded, mainly with coal. Many passengers also arrived in Shanghai. The head of the Pingyang Consolidated Tax Bureau traveled to Shanghai on this vessel. According to the crew, when the Xinruiping left Pingyang on the 29th, the area was peaceful and the people felt relatively secure. Pingyang is separated from the Fujian border by the Fen Shui Ling, a distance of several hundred li, mostly through mountainous terrain, making travel very difficult.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements of Warships</h3>
<p>A few days ago, due to troop deployments in Taishun County, which borders Zhejiang and Fujian, there were false rumors of a military mutiny, causing considerable anxiety among the people in the Ruiping area. The Zhejiang Overseas Water Police Bureau dispatched the warship Yongping to be stationed there. The Yongping is currently docked in Pingyang for the purpose of providing local defense.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou is Safe</h3>
<p>Currently, four vessels operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Recently, due to the large shipments of food supplies that have been completed, Wenzhou merchants are rushing to prepare for New Year's goods. Although merchants have not stopped trading due to the impact of the Fujian Incident, they have curtailed loans due to tight credit conditions. As a result, cargo shipments from Shanghai to Wenzhou have plummeted, reaching only half the usual volume. Yesterday, the Lian'an Shipping Bureau sent a telegram inquiring about the situation in the area. They received a reply in the afternoon stating that the situation in Wenzhou was stable, so the Shanghai-Wenzhou liners are all operating as usual.</p>
<h3>Ample Fujian Goods</h3>
<p>The navy has not yet blockaded the port of Sanduao. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's vessel Jiesheng left for Fuzhou as usual at around 2:00 PM. Shanghai-based Fujian merchants shipped a total of 700 tons of goods, a twofold increase compared to the previous shipment, mainly textiles. Many passengers traveling to Fujian also departed on this vessel from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Beijing Denies Rumors of Chiang's Resignation</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that a certain foreign newspaper in Shanghai previously published news that Chairman Chiang was considering resigning. According to a central government official speaking to a reporter stationed in Beijing for the New Voice News Agency, the rumors of Chairman Chiang's resignation circulating in Shanghai on the (30th) are completely unfounded.</p>

<h3>Observations on the Current Situation After the Fujian Incident: Reporter from Shenshi News Agency Flies from Fujian to Shanghai Yesterday; The Reported Situation</h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that since the coup in Fujian Province, rumors have been rampant. The Shenshi News Agency dispatched a reporter to fly to Guangdong and then to Fujian some days ago. He returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday afternoon. The various pieces of information he has obtained are detailed below:</p>
<h3>Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency reporter's extensive investigations in Fuzhou, the actual military strength of Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others after the coup in Fujian consists of approximately 40,000 troops in the main force of the 19th Route Army, supplemented by miscellaneous troops, totaling no more than 60,000. The organization is as follows: 1st Army Commander Shen Guangdian, Deputy Commander Li Chengzong; 2nd Army Commander Mao Weishou, Deputy Commander Zhang Li; 3rd Army Commander Qu Shounian, Deputy Commander Huang Gu; 4th Army Commander Zhang Yan; 5th Army Commander Tan Qixiu; 1st Division Commander Liu Zhanxiong; 2nd Division Commander Pang Cheng; 3rd Division Commander Zhang Junsong; 4th Division Commander Situ Fei; 5th Division Commander Xie Shousheng; 7th Division Commander Zhao Yijian; 60th Division Commander Deng Zhicai; 61st Division Commander Liang Shiji; 71st Division Commander Ying Yunlin; 49th Division Commander Hong Huanbao. The numbers in each army are mostly insufficient and they are actively being replenished and trained. Recently, Weng Zhaoyuan has also been heavily involved in reorganizing the militia. It has now been decided that there will be five general brigades, divided into four detachments, led by Chen Weijin, Peng Tang, Zhang Xiongnan, and Lin Jing as detachment commanders, with a strength of approximately 3,000 men. In terms of air power, only twelve aircraft are available for combat.</p>
<h3>Lifting of Martial Law in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the People's Government, martial law was imposed by the city defense commander due to the tense situation. It was lifted on the 27th of last month, and people can now move freely at night. However, people wishing to leave Fuzhou are still subject to strict restrictions and must report in detail to the Provincial Public Security Bureau and obtain permission before leaving the province. However, when the reporter left Fuzhou, large luggage was still strictly prohibited from leaving the city.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Denies Holding a Finance Conference in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the overnight train at 7:30 AM yesterday. At 11:00 AM, he went to the Central Bank to work. According to Kong, he denied the rumor that a financial conference would be held in Shanghai. When asked about the Western press reports that Hu Hanmin was in contact with Li Zongren and others to form another government, Kong said he had not heard of it.</p>
<h3>Fujian Party Members in Shanghai Form the Fujian Party Protection Comrades Association; Meeting Held at the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Yesterday Afternoon; Thirteen Executive Committee Members Elected</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Fujian Party members forced to leave Fujian and Fujian Party members in Shanghai held a meeting of Fujian Party members in Shanghai at the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association on Simalu yesterday afternoon to form the Fujian Party Protection Comrades Association and elect executive committee members. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Party Members Present</h3>
<p>Those present included Liu Chengcan, Wei Yonggong, Chen Huaimin, Xu Jigong, Wang Yongzhen, Liu Fuqiang, Chen Ziyan, Jiang Yubo, Ke Zhuo, Zhou Yimin, Ye Yuqing, Lin Fang, Li Weiye, Zhang Ji, Huang Chen, Zhang Binghui, and dozens of others. Liu Chengcan was elected chairman, and Lin Fang as recorder.</p>
<h3>Report on Past Events</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony, Chairman Liu Chengcan reported on the purpose of the meeting. Next, Chen Huaimin, a Party committee member forced to leave Fujian, reported on his departure from Fujian. Chen Huaimin stated that he left Fuzhou on the 25th of last month and arrived in Shanghai on the 29th, and was deeply saddened to attend the meeting. Fujian has fallen into a state of demise, and people have lost all freedom. Those wishing to leave must obtain a permit from the so-called People's Government and Public Security Bureau, otherwise they are not allowed to leave Fujian. Fortunately, he left Fujian earlier. On the 24th of last month, the Public Security Bureau, under orders from the so-called People's Government, forced the entire city to cease work, business, and schooling in order to participate in the so-called National People's Congress. Detectives arrested leaders from all walks of life, closed down all labor unions, and Sa Zhenbing was also arrested to participate. At that time, counterfeit representatives such as Huang Qixiang, He Gonggan, and Jiang Guangnai openly announced the overthrow of the Kuomintang, passed the so-called political program, and forced people to parade. Economically, they withdrew all paper currency and opened a new bank. Communist elements were disrupting everywhere, and the people were unable to live in peace and work in contentment. The people of Fuzhou are not allowed to walk after 4:00 PM every day, and all speech is restricted. Fortunately, we escaped the fire pit and should strive to save the province and the Party.</p>
<h3>Elections Held</h3>
<p>After the report, the Party members present discussed the formation of the Party Protection Comrades Association and decided on the name: The Chinese Kuomintang Fujian Party Protection Comrades Association. After the name was decided, they elected Liu Chengcan, Chen Wulie, Chen Huaimin, Xu Jigong, Lin Shouchang, Chen Qun, Zhang Ji, Wei Yonggong, Li Suixian, Wang Yongzhen, Lin Fang, Huang Jianzhong, Ye Yuqing, and thirteen others as executive committee members.</p>
<h3>Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>Subsequently, it was resolved that (1) the Executive Committee would establish a standing committee of five members, under which would be established three sections: General Affairs, Organization, and Propaganda; (2) all telegrams and declarations related to the suppression of the rebellion would be handled by the Executive Committee. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Fujian Funing Fellow-Provincials Association Sends Telegram to Beijing Condemning the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>The Fujian Funing Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday. Those present included Wei Yonggong, Chen Ziyan, Huang Jiaxiang, Chen Diguang, Zhang Kongzhuang, Li Yingzhou, Liu Yuxing, and Liu Guanghan. Those in attendance included Wang Quanyu, Chen Ziyang, Du Xingyuan, Liu Yudun, and others. Chairman Wei Yonggong stated that the current Fujian Incident was caused by a reactionary group that colluded with Japan, causing widespread anxiety. They passed a resolution to send a telegram of opposition and request the central government to quickly impose sanctions. The telegram was sent immediately as follows: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Chairman Lin, Premier Wang, and Chairman Chiang: Since the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, it has changed its original face, abandoned its task of suppressing bandits, and has been tyrannical and insatiable. Its various crimes are too numerous to list. At a time when internal and external troubles are pressing, all with blood and breath should consider the difficulties of the time, support the central government, and work together to overcome national difficulties. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, with wolfish ambitions and a crazy rampage, have dared to openly betray the Party and the country. The reactionary group is pro-Japan and colludes with the Communists, selling out the nation, fearing that its demise will not come soon enough. The sorrow of the matter is unbearable. Now that the rebellious actions are clear, the country is in turmoil. The people of Fujian feel the pain deeply and cannot sit idly by and wait for death. We earnestly request the central government to issue a clear order to suppress them with thunderous force. Our fellow citizens pledge to fight to the death to be the central government's rearguard and hasten its destruction to secure the foundation of the nation and bring peace to the people. In haste, we cannot express our indignation sufficiently.</p>
<h3>Municipal Security Department Holds Military Review Ceremony This Morning; Mayor Wu Invited to Deliver Speech; Various Bureau Directors Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>The Municipal Security Department has achieved remarkable results since its establishment. Its organization includes the First Regiment, Second Regiment, Training Corps, Special Task Force, and Communications Team, with very adequate military equipment.

In addition to Sun Yat-sen's portrait and Kuomintang and national flags hung on the reviewing stand, there are also couplets and banners and a</p>
<h3>Strong and Cunning Defense in the Joint Telegram from Li, Chen, Jiang, Cai, Fu, and Hu</h3>
<p>The Minyan News Agency's Fuzhou air express reports that after the Fujian Province's coup and the establishment of an independent government, Hu Hanmin, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zou Lu, and others sent a joint telegram to Fujian questioning Li, Chen, Jiang, Cai, etc., for breaking away from the Kuomintang (note: the original telegram was published in various newspapers the day before). Li et al. sent a reply, excerpts of which are below:</p>
<p>(Greetings omitted) Upon receiving the telegram from Elder Brother, we have been running around and appealing for months, our hearts and strength exhausted. The situation is precarious, and we established a government in Fuzhou, which shook the country. We hoped to work together with you to overcome national difficulties, but we did not expect to be misunderstood by the virtuous. We deeply regret this. We dare to explain to you on behalf of ourselves, hoping to dispel your doubts. For months, we have promoted the public to lead in politics and Bonan to be the leader in the military, sacrificing everything. However, the result is contrary to what we expected. With the country in such a state, Dongshan does not come out. Apart from us striving to serve, what else can we hope for? If we follow your advice, we will accomplish nothing. Since the establishment of the revolutionary government, you must have some misunderstanding because of the distant news. In short, we deeply hope that you will persevere in your original intention and fight together. If you can announce the formation of another government, then although our political views may not be entirely the same, military and political cooperation is negotiable. We would also be grateful for your guidance. If you have any lingering doubts or reservations, we have long since stopped considering our success or failure. Given our deep mutual affection and your earnest words, we have briefly stated the truth. If you can dispel your doubts, we can build a great cause based on our consistent positions. We respectfully reply to this telegram, awaiting your instructions. (Signed) Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai.</p>
<p>Thorough Arrangements: The situation is particularly solemn. It is reported that Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, in addition to dispatching the entire band to participate in playing music, has also ordered the police stations under his jurisdiction to send dozens of police officers to maintain order. The bureau's detective team leader, Lu Ying, personally led twenty detectives to take care of the situation. The Inspection Department also sent several inspectors to assist the police in maintaining order.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between State-Run and Private Shipping Industries in Water-Land Transportation: | This is the First Step Towards Recovering Shipping Rights | The Joint Office Will Be Established Upon Order; The Allocation Method Will Be Determined Based on Routes and Vessels</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is handling national water-land transportation, and various private shipping companies are striving to join. After the Ministry of Railways decided on a cooperation method between state-run and private companies, companies such as Sanbei are organizing a joint office. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Organization of Joint Office</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is handling national water-land transportation. In addition to the Longhai Railway, which was implemented on the 20th of last month, the Tianjin-Pukou, Beining, Pinghan, Jinghu, Huhu-Ningbo, Zhengda, Daoqing, Pingsui, Jiaoji, Xiang'e and ten other railways were originally scheduled to be implemented yesterday. Now, the implementation has been postponed due to the private sector's joining the intermodal transport case. After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the private Sanbei Company receive orders from the Ministry of Railways, they will convene a meeting of various private shipping companies to organize a joint office for private and state-run shipping industries, implement cooperation, and then separately handle national railway intermodal transport.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Recapturing Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Yu Qiaqing, general manager of Sanbei Company, yesterday. According to him, the Ministry of Railways has decided on a cooperation method for the private shipping industry's participation in the intermodal transport case, which will be handled by a joint office organized by state-run and private companies. Preparations will begin in Shanghai as soon as the ministry's order arrives. In the future, the allocation of various railway intermodal transport services will be determined based on the routes and vessels operated by each shipping company, with a cooperative spirit and mutual adjustment. This method is actually the first step in fundamentally recovering shipping rights.</p>

<h3>International Silk Conference Passes Resolution to Restrict Dumping of Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>In recent years, the dumping of Japanese silk to foreign countries has attracted international attention. Therefore, at this International Silk Conference, a resolution was passed to restrict the import volume of Japanese silk. Our country's envoy to France, Gu Weijun, has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the details of the conference's resolution, which has been forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for information. The International Trade Bureau of this city received the Ministry's instruction yesterday. The instruction stated that Envoy Gu in Paris telegraphed that at the International Silk Conference, an agreement was reached, based on the proposal of the British delegation, to oppose the dumping of all kinds of Japanese silk products, and each representative would negotiate with their respective governments to restrict the amount of Japanese silk imports to a maximum of the average amount between 1927 and 1930. The American and Italian representatives felt that this method was too harsh and suggested changing it to a proposal to the Japanese silk industry, but it was not passed. In addition to instructing the consulate general to report in detail, please forward it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Ministry, in addition to issuing orders and awaiting a detailed report from the consulate general before issuing further orders, hereby orders the bureau to inform and forward it to silk industry organizations for their information.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the Taikoo Strike Remains Unsettled; Business Community Dissatisfied with Lack of Compensation for Inventory Losses; Workers Question Restructuring, Telegraph Guangdong to Inquire About Terms</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the resolution of the labor-management dispute at the Taikoo Company in Guangzhou on the 15th of last month, the employees of the Foshan freighter resumed work on the 27th. The business community in Guangdong expressed dissatisfaction that the company did not provide compensation for significant losses and telegraphed various locations to refuse to load Taikoo vessels. The workers of the Wusong freighter held a meeting yesterday to discuss resuming work and decided to continue discussions today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Route Resumption</h3>
<p>Over one hundred employees of the Taikoo Hong Kong-Guangzhou freighter Foshan, who had been on strike for seven months due to dissatisfaction with the company's handling of the Wusong freighter workers, resumed work in Guangzhou at noon on the 27th of last month after the labor-management negotiations in Guangzhou resulted in the company compensating the actors for losses of 160,000 Guangdong silver dollars. Dock workers and Taikoo warehouse workers also simultaneously resumed work. The Taikoo Nanhua freighter also resumed the Guangzhou route at the same time.</p>
<h3>Business and Industry Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>Various business groups such as the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Grain Association,封鎖 Taikoo warehouses to facilitate negotiations for the Guangdong sailors, causing Taikoo inventories to suffer mildew and losses exceeding five million yuan. At the time, it was hoped that compensation would be obtained after the negotiations were resolved. Also, the workers in the civilian boat hostels and other industries opposed it because they refused to sell Taikoo tickets and unload goods at the time, and now there is no compensation. Therefore, they rose up in opposition, issued a declaration, and telegraphed to refuse to load Taikoo vessels.</p>
<h3>Restructuring of Vessels</h3>
<p>The resolution of the Wusong freighter case in Guangzhou included six terms, including the complete resumption of work by the Wusong freighter workers. Within one month, the company will carry out a reorganization. In addition to those working on the ships, each person will be given 25 yuan for dismissal. The company will notify the resumption period in advance, register and pay wages. Gao Kunquan, a worker who was kidnapped and disappeared, will be handed over by the company within two weeks. There is also an attached clause stipulating that the company will continue to restructure the vessels.</p>
<h3>Workers Gather to Discuss</h3>
<p>The 126 workers in the Wusong freighter's middle cabin have been unemployed for a year, experiencing great hardship. Now that work is resuming, there will still be reductions, and they suspect that it is called restructuring. They held a meeting at the Middle Cabin Company on Jiuxiaochang Road at 2:00 PM yesterday and decided: (1) Telegraph the Guangdong Seamen's Union to inquire about the terms of the resolution. (2) Continue discussing the resumption of work at 2:00 PM tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Company Marine Engineer Salary Increase Dispute Resolved; Social Affairs Bureau Convened Mediation Yesterday; Both Parties Signed Three Measures</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, marine engineers of the Ning Shao Company's Ning Shao, Ning Jing, and Xin Ning Shao freighters have traditionally received double pay at the end of the year. However, other shipping companies do not have this double pay system. Therefore, the company was questioned by its competitors and announced in July of this year that it would abolish the double pay and instead increase the monthly salary. However, the agreed-upon measures were considered uneven by both parties, leading to a dispute and a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. After receiving the request, the bureau feared that a dispute would arise, affecting transportation. It immediately sent personnel to investigate the truth and persuaded both parties to negotiate a settlement. After more than a month, there was still no news from either party. In order to seek a swift resolution, the bureau convened mediation yesterday. Feng Yuming from the labor side and Lu Ziyang and Chen Renzheng from the capital side, and Chen Shiqi from the Party Department attended. Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau presided, and Wang Zhiqin recorded. After repeated negotiations between the two parties, a satisfactory solution was reached. From November onwards, the salary scales of the marine engineers of each freighter were set, and the capital side also expressed its recognition. The settlement measures were then signed as follows: (1) The salary scales of the marine engineers of the Xin Ning Shao, Ning Jing, and Ning Shao freighters of the Ning Shao Shipping Company have been revised due to the cancellation of the year-end double pay, as follows: (A) Xin Ning Shao: Chief Engineer, 250 yuan per month; First Engineer, 165 yuan; Second Engineer, 100 yuan; Coppersmith, 55 yuan. (B) Ning Jing: Chief Engineer, 200 yuan per month; First Engineer, 160 yuan; Second Engineer, 100 yuan. (C) Ning Shao: Chief Engineer, 190 yuan per month; First Engineer, 145 yuan; Second Engineer, 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industries Petition the Ministry of Finance to Revise Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association Union and the Alcohol Industry Association Union have repeatedly protested regarding the new tax regulations, but to no avail. As a result, merchants and related workers in both industries feel exceptionally distressed. They have elected Yu Xunlu, Zhang Suhou, Zhang Dalian, Chen Weiwen, and others as eight petition representatives to go to Beijing on the 25th, convene the representatives, and discuss two concrete measures: (1) Petition for revision of the tax regulations. (2) Accuse Xie Qi, the Director of the Tax Affairs Department. On the 30th, they went to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to petition and submit a memorial. The original text of their memorial to the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan was published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we have obtained the original text of their memorial to the Ministry of Finance and transcribe it below:</p>
<p>Presenting a memorial regarding the new tobacco and alcohol system, whose provisions are harsh and cumbersome, restricting business and causing distress to taxpayers. We respectfully dispatch representatives to petition, hoping that you will examine and grant a proper revision, so as to increase tax revenue and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. It is our humble opinion that since the beginning of this year, the Tax Affairs Department has abolished the old tobacco and alcohol monopoly system and revised the special tax on native tobacco leaves and the fixed tax on native alcohol. The rules and regulations promulgated are meticulous and restrictive, no less than placing tobacco and alcohol merchants in a dead end. Our Association has repeatedly drafted summaries and petitioned for revisions, but has not been approved. Merchants paying taxes is an obligation to be fulfilled, and showing compassion for the people is an essential part of governance. Now, the government, facing an empty treasury, seeks ways to increase revenue, and merchants share the difficulties, responding to all requests. However, the tax authorities do not understand, demanding without end. They either find fault with incomplete procedures or impose severe penalties for non-compliance with the regulations. This new system has been in effect for five months, and the failure to reconcile with business conditions is the source of frequent disputes. We hereby present a brief account, item by item, for your Lordship's review and grant of revisions, so that both tax authorities and merchants can benefit. (1) Unequal Tax Rates: In the case of imitation Shaoxing wine (i.e., Suzhou-made native yellow wine by Shaoxing merchants), if it is native yellow wine, the tax rate is 80 cents per 100 jin. However, for the Suzhou-made native yellow wine by Shaoxing merchants, the tax authorities cleverly create a name, imitation Shaoxing wine, and the tax rate is 1 yuan and 40 cents per 100 jin, an increase of 60 cents. For Shaoxing wine merchants from various counties in Zhejiang Province who produce yellow wine, the same tax is levied as native yellow wine, without distinguishing the merchants' origin. Furthermore, for Shaoxing wine produced in Shaoxing, the tax rate is 1 yuan and 40 cents, and in the sales area, it is 2 yuan. Production and sales in Zou Province should be average, so how can there be a sudden increase of 60 cents? Moreover, Shaoxing merchants also produce yellow wine, which has always been taxed at the same rate as native yellow wine, without distinguishing the origin of the wine merchants (because the raw materials of Shaoxing yellow wine are not different from those of local yellow wine, and the selling price is about the same). It should be treated equally as Suzhou products. As for Shaoxing wine, because it is produced in the old Shaoxing Prefecture and sold outside the area, the customary name is Shaoxing wine. Those sold within the old Shaoxing Prefecture are still called yellow wine. The tax authorities have set different tax rates for yellow wine produced in the old Shaoxing Prefecture of Zhejiang Province. Shaoxing wine is 1 yuan and 40 cents per 100 jin, while yellow wine produced in other counties is taxed as native yellow wine at 1 yuan per 100 jin. Furthermore, the provincial tax on Shaoxing wine produced within the production area is 86 cents and 4 li per 100 jin, and the monopoly fee is 80 cents, totaling 1 yuan 66 cents and 4 li. When the Suzhou tax system was reformed, the provincial tax was abolished long ago, and only the monopoly fee was levied at 1 yuan and 20 cents per 100 jin. Merchants raised funds, and the actual payment was 76 cents and 8 li per 100 jin. Now, the new tax system is based on the original 20% of the monopoly fee, so why does Shaoxing wine alone increase by 1 yuan? The actual tax rate is increased by 1 yuan 23 cents and 2 li per 100 jin, making it clear that the sales area is more heavily taxed than the production area. Also, in the past, native yellow wine from the upper districts had no tax in the concessions and half tax (i.e., special levy) in the Chinese areas. Now, under the new system, taxation cannot be effectively implemented in the concessions, and the half tax is immediately abolished in the Chinese areas, forcing the collection of the full tax. The above is clear evidence of unequal tax rates. (2) Extortion Along the Way: In the past, during the chaotic war era, merchants transporting goods only needed to pay the required tax to pass unhindered. Now, under the new tax system, even after paying taxes and obtaining a license, the goods are inspected along the way, examining their credentials, in a manner similar to variable Likin taxes. Furthermore, there are deliberate delays and difficulties, requiring payments to pass. For example, 69 pieces of tobacco collected in Jiangyin were extorted 10 cents per piece during inspection in Suzhou-Wuxi, totaling 6 yuan and 90 cents. Also, 15 pieces of Zhuoyun tobacco leaves were extorted 1 yuan per piece by the Guandong-Ganzhou branch, totaling 15 yuan (both of the above cases have been investigated and filed by the association with the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau). Also, the four boats of Taiyu Zhang's liquor passed through Hengtang Town in Suzhou-Wuxi, and the liquor tax had been paid in accordance with regulations and certificates affixed. However, a patrolling officer Xu falsely claimed that the tax stickers were insufficient, forcibly demanding a huge tax of 200 dan and threatening to impose a fine of 5,000 yuan. In fact, they wanted to extort money for the pass. Later, the merchant reported to the relevant department and asked them to verify the tax amount, which was consistent. In theory, the case should have been dismissed. However, the inspector, failing to extort money, falsely accused the special investigator of assault and sent the merchant to the local public security bureau, detaining him for five days. The above three examples are clear evidence of extortion along the way. (3) Severe Penalties: In the past, Shaoxing wine from Taixing shipped to Shanghai was calculated at five or eight parts. This time, the revised new system specifies that it should be calculated at seven or five parts. Taxes were supplemented in accordance with regulations, but the inspectors still re-examined them and determined that they did not match, forcing the calculation at eight parts. The remaining 40 dan or so were considered to be merchants deliberately trying to take advantage and evade taxes. The affixed tax certificates were completely invalidated, and taxes were re-collected. Furthermore, the liquor skins were confiscated, and a similar amount of fines was levied. This is clear evidence of severe penalties. (4)</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Resembles Double Taxation: The government has clearly ordered that one item be taxed only once. The existing tobacco and alcohol inventories have already paid the monopoly tax and fee. Of course, if the goods have already been taxed, then even if the new system is revised, there is no reason for double taxation. Otherwise, it is clear evidence of resembling double taxation. (5) Disparate Treatment: The fixed tax on native alcohol is divided into categories, and the tax rates are set accordingly. However, the special tax on native tobacco leaves does not distinguish between high and low grades, and the same 4 yuan 15 cents is levied per 100 jin. For high-grade tobacco leaves worth 70 or 80 yuan, 4 yuan 15 cents are levied, while for low-grade leaf and autumn leaves worth 13 yuan, the same 4 yuan 15 cents is levied. The cost difference is enormous. The tax rates should be set according to the quality of the alcohol. Otherwise, it is clear evidence of disparate treatment. The Association has the state's tax revenue at heart and considers the difficulties of merchants. It has no choice but to appeal for relief. It has specially appointed Yu Xunlu, Zhang Dalian, Cao Gexian, Gao Youming, Jin Jingjie, Zhang Suhou, Ru Baiquan, and Wang Xingguo to be petition representatives and seek redress, presenting their grievances in person. It is appropriate to submit a memorial, hoping that your Lordship will examine and adopt it, quickly revise and improve the new system's regulations, so that tax revenue will be prosperous and merchants will have convenience, in line with the purpose of enriching taxes and pacifying merchants. With utmost respect, we respectfully submit this to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Stipulates Regulations for Luggage Crossing the River Fee: Free Weight Should Be Deducted First</h3>
<p>The Two Railways Administration received Instruction No. 7433 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which read: "Regarding the report from the Hunan-Hubei Section Administration of the Yuehan Railway, stating, 'Whether the luggage crossing the river fee should be calculated based on weight, or whether the free weight should be deducted, please check and instruct, etc.' Based on this, it is found that the regulations for the railway transportation of luggage have provisions for free limits for each class. The ferry crossing fee should be handled uniformly, first deducting the free weight stipulated in the Passenger Car Transportation Rules, and then calculating the crossing fee. In addition to Xu's instructions and sub-instructions, you should be aware of this order." The Administration has forwarded this order to the Transportation Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Relief Association Continues to Make 100,000 Sets of Cotton Clothes, All Are Suits and Women's Clothes</h3>
<p>The relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association previously made 100,000 sets of cotton clothes, which have been distributed to the disaster areas of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces. Due to the large number of disaster victims and the small number of distributions, another 100,000 sets will be made and distributed successively so that extremely poor disaster victims can barely keep warm. The relief group has already started rushing to make them. Because the previous cotton clothes were all adult men's clothes, this time the order is divided into children's clothes and women's clothes, and adult men's clothes will no longer be made.</p>
<h3>Monk Hongsan Telegraphed to Report on the Inspection and Relief of the Yellow River Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanghai charitable organizations' committee for raising emergency relief funds for the Yellow River flood disaster received a telegram yesterday from Dharma Master Hongsan, who was sent to Henan to inspect and provide relief: "To the honorable members, (November 24th), I hope you have received the telegram. I understand the telegram (November 23rd). The continued allocation of relief funds of 15,000 yuan has been received. I have taken 500 yuan from Kaifeng to Huaxian.

I specially report, Hongsan bows east."</p>
<h3>After the Abolishment of the Fisheries Bureau, Yuan Lianghua Did Not Take Office as Ocean Protection Commissioner; Dai Yongyong Went to Beijing for the Salary Arrears Case</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau have been ordered to close down. All staff members, except for a few who will be retained to temporarily manage unfinished matters, have been completely dismissed. The Ministry also instructed the Director of the Administration Bureau, Yuan Lianghua, to temporarily manage the documents and cases. The Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office, because the accounts of all eleven collection offices in the Ningzhen District, Hangjia-Shao District, Ningxiang-Nan District, Taizhou District, Wenzhou District, Songhu District, Zhenchang District, Chongtong District, Haizhou District, and the Hubei-Suzhou District, which has been suspended, have not been reported, resulting in failure to complete the liquidation by the deadline. It was decided to extend the period and handle the liquidation after the branch collection offices submit their reports. Dai Yongyong, the current director, has gone to Beijing to await instructions regarding the eight months of salary arrears owed to all the employees of the collection offices. Previous reports stated that Director Yuan Lianghua was transferred by the Ministry to the Ocean Protection Commissioner and continued to collect ocean protection fees and construction fees, and that all five patrol ships, Biaohai, Haiying, Haihong, Haigu, and Qing'an, were assigned to the Ministry's command. According to the statements of Director Yuan and Hou Zhaohai, the executive member of the Improvement Association, they absolutely deny this and insist that the Ministry has not issued such an order. All patrol ships are now rushing back to Shanghai to await orders.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Introduces Fuel-Saving Essence</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce announced to all guilds, stores, and members in the city yesterday: "Dear Sirs, on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Taxi Industry Association of this city, stating, 'The Business Research Association of our association has decided that the Fina-Vas fuel-saving essence will be exclusively sold citywide. It can reduce gasoline consumption. On the 2nd, 9th, and 14th of this month, we gathered fourteen companies from the industry at appropriate locations and conducted three on-site tests using various methods. The conclusion is that it can definitely exceed the mileage of pure gasoline and save an average of four to ten percent of fuel costs. If Asia Salad Oil or Mobil Dali Oil is mixed with gasoline and then added to the fuel-saving essence (which removes carbon deposits and does not produce smoke), the savings will be even greater. It is a good product for saving fuel for all kinds of cars. We dare to send this letter to request your association to help promote it and to send letters to various industry associations, informing members with cars to come and buy it to save public expenses and benefit the association's sales. Thank you for your kindness, etc.' The Association is pleased to introduce this product, hoping that you will check and inform members with cars to persuade them to buy and try it, so as to save expenses."</p>

<h3>Sudden Death Dispute of Noodles Shop Apprentice: Awaiting Forensic Examination</h3>
<p>Zhong Baogen, who runs a noodle shop in Tangjiawan outside Ximen, is from Danyang. Wang Xiaohai, an eighteen-year-old fellow townsman of the woman Wang Zhao, was an apprentice in his shop. He suddenly died in September. Zhong immediately arranged for a hasty encoffining and ordered someone to send the body back to Danyang for burial. Wang Zhao had not yet learned of this. She came to Shanghai to look for her son. Zhong claimed that he died from heatstroke, but the body was not shown. The woman inquired with the neighbors, who all said that Wang Xiaohai was first severely beaten by Zhong for embezzling a dime of auxiliary currency. In the evening, he was tied to the flour-grinding machine and electrocuted to death. Because the foolish deed was discovered, he was immediately buried, and so on. The woman, believing that her son died an unnatural death and that the body was destroyed, filed a complaint with the local court. Zhong Baogen was arrested. He still claimed that the death was due to an epidemic, and that the coffin was sent back to the mother, but she had not received it. Since the testimonies in this case are contradictory, the matter cannot be clarified without turning over the coffin for examination. Therefore, Zhong was released on bail. Zhong has now transported the coffin from Danyang by private boat to the river under Xinzha Bridge. He reported this to the court yesterday. The Chief Prosecutor, Lou Ying, officially instructed the police to have the plaintiff and defendant send the coffin to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Office for an initial opening. After both parties identify the body, a surgical autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death and to investigate the internal organs to determine how he died, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kuang Hu Drowns Herself in River for Seven Yuan Debt: Rescued and Spared from Drowning</h3>
<p>Kuang Hu, an elderly woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 142 Guangqi Road inside Xiaodongmen, is fifty-eight years old. Her husband has been dead for many years, and her family is impoverished. Her only son is also indolent, spending all day outside and not pursuing a proper career, leaving the woman without any support. She relies solely on her ten fingers to make lace for others. This summer, due to a pressing need, she borrowed seven yuan from her relative, Zhou Hu. Aside from two yuan already repaid, she still owed five yuan. The other day, Zhou Hu went to Kuang Hu's residence to demand the loan. Because she had no money to pay, she was scolded by Zhou Hu, causing her extreme anger. Thinking that her late years were meaningless, she had the thought of committing suicide. She went out alone and walked to the Bund outside Sima Road. Taking advantage of people's inattention, she sighed and jumped into the river, hoping to end her life and finish her remaining years. Fortunately, a passerby saw her and quickly called on boatmen to rescue her from the water, allowing her to be reborn. The police were immediately notified and brought her to the police station. After questioning by the chief, since she lived in the Chinese concession, around 9 PM the previous evening, officer Yang Zaishan was dispatched to send her to the No. 2 section of the No. 1 district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and she was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau around 1 PM yesterday for arrangements.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Public Security Bureau Cracks Down on Male and Female Child Traffickers</h3>
<p>Recently, child trafficking has been rampant in the Zhabei area, and advertisements seeking lost children have been posted everywhere. It has come to light that Xu Zhihui (32 years old, from Yangzhou), who runs a grocery store named "Xu Xia Tai" at No. 216, the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Jiaotong Road, had a three-year-old daughter named Rongmei who was abducted by bandits around 1 PM on November 21. Xu immediately sent out detectives in all directions, but could not find her. Until the other day, someone reported that Rongmei had been trafficked to a thatched shed under the No. 1 bridge of Ximei Road in the Fen District of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, behind the Fenshui Temple, and so on. That evening, Xu hired a car to go to the station, and reported to the Xinkang Police Station, who dispatched police to arrest them in the thatched shed. However, the child traffickers had already escaped, having heard the news. Later, Xu discovered that Rongmei was hidden on a small boat in that location, so he went to check the boat again. Indeed, he saw Rongmei and two other children sleeping on the boat. At that time, the male and female accomplices of the child traffickers, Wang Si and his wife, Tian, were arrested. Because the case originated in the Fourth District of Zhabei and involved the capture of the remaining accomplices, Xu immediately took Wang Si and his wife, as well as Rongmei, in a car to Zhabei. According to Wang Si's confession, he is 31 years old and from Funing. Wang Tian claimed to be 30 years old. Both stated that Rongmei was entrusted to them for foster care by their friend Wang Liu, who lived at No. 40, Liuhe Lane, Jiangmiao Road, at the end of Datong Road. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau ordered Police Chief Chen Maoxiu of the Zhongxing Road Precinct to lead the police to Liuhe Lane and arrest Wang Liu. However, Liu's name Xin Di had already fled. After bringing the case to trial, Wang Liu, 29 years old and from Taizhou, confessed. She remained silent about the abduction of Rongmei. After examining the confession, the interrogating officer ruled that the case involved the abduction of a child and ordered that it be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal. It is also rumored that the child traffickers had just come to Shanghai from Wuxi, and had many accomplices. They entrusted the Shanghai-based bandits to lure and abduct children everywhere, and then transport them to Shantou and Xiamen to sell them for profit.</p>
<h3>Taxi Association Studies Operating Small Cars</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangsheng, chairman of the Taxi Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that all industries in this city are winning by cooperation, this industry should follow the trend and try to improve to facilitate customers. Also, considering that the payment of various fees has been increasing sharply recently, and the cost aspect needs to be carefully controlled to support the industry, he invited more than 30 companies in the industry to a dinner at Tongxinglou on Sima Road at 6 PM yesterday to discuss ways to improve business. It is planned to add 20 or 50 small cars. The rental price is six jiao every 20 minutes, and one yuan and five jiao per hour. However, the price is low and the operation is convenient, which will surely please customers and add color to serving the society. According to the research of various companies in the industry, it is generally said that the quality of gasoline in a certain country is inferior, and the oil in barrels is also insufficient. After discussion, the industry decided not to purchase it starting from December to avoid secret losses.</p>
<h3>Zhang Chaozuo Transferred to the Third Branch Court</h3>

<h3>Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Troupe's Mongolian Border and Northwest Exhibition Opens: Held for Ten Days at the Civic Education Center Starting Yesterday: Second Long-Distance Propaganda Tour Begins After Closing: Chairman Lin and Others Inscribe Gifts</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Border and Northwest Exhibition has been actively preparing. Because new, large paintings needed to be added, it was delayed until yesterday morning before it officially opened. The organizers of the exhibition are Shen Qianyi, head of the Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Troupe, and seven members of his troupe. They have been setting up at the Civic Education Center for days and were ready yesterday. Visitors came in an endless stream. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Open-Air Exhibition</h3>
<p>Upon entering, there is a large horizontal cloth banner with the words "Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Troupe's Mongolian Border and Northwest Exhibition." The most eye-catching feature of the exhibition is the large oil paintings hanging on the walls of the Confucius Temple Park. The large ones are several zhang long, and the small ones are also square zhang or seven or eight chi. They all depict the scenery of the Mongolian border and the Great Wall, the tragic scenes of Japanese massacres, or allegorical paintings to awaken the people. There are dozens of them, covering almost all the walls outside the Dacheng Gate, Dacheng Hall, Minglun Hall, and Chongsheng Ancestral Hall, shocking viewers.</p>
<h3>Sketches from Various Places</h3>
<p>The first and second exhibition halls are in the Health Exhibition Room of the Civic Education Center. The sketches and photographs on display are signed with place names, such as Guihua, Suiyuan, Yingfang, Weinan, Baotou Yinshan, Longmen, Yaoxian, Jin Suo Guan, Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou, Fushi County, Jing Shuidu, Xuanyuan Tomb, Zhaojun Tomb, Northern Shaanxi, Yijun, Datong, etc. The paintings all come from sketches from the actual sites, which can give a glimpse of the customs and humanity of the border areas.</p>
<h3>Northwest Products</h3>
<p>The third exhibition hall, in the music room of the center, has even more displays. In addition to paintings and sketches, there are various products from the Mongolian border and the Northwest, such as Baotou's woolen yarn, wool grabs, etc. There are also artistic carpets, all woven by Mongolian natives. The troupe members drew the designs, so they are very beautiful. According to the troupe leader, Mr. Shen, if this kind of product can be improved, it can exceed imported goods by a hundred times. Its solid quality can guarantee use for a hundred years. There are countless amounts of sheep wool and real camel wool abandoned on the ground outside the pass, which is a pity. In addition, there are many varieties of Western Xia script, Mongolian script, Tibetan script, and Manchu script on display.</p>
<h3>Inscriptions from Important People</h3>
<p>Lin Sen, chairman of the National Government, inscribed to the troupe, saying, "Expressing the enthusiasm for saving the country and relieving the people from suffering, developing it into art, this kind of work is of value." Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, inscribed the four characters "Art Saves the Country." Shao Lizi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, inscribed the four characters "Awaken the People." The Mayor of this city inscribed the four characters "Shocking to the Eye." In addition, there are many inscriptions from important people, hanging on the four walls in a dazzling array.</p>
<h3>Exhibition for Ten Days</h3>
<p>According to the troupe leader, the exhibition will last for a total of ten days. After ten days, the troupe will have a second trip to the Northwest, going to Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet, and then circling to the Southwest for a grand tour of thousands of miles. The Central Government has also entrusted them with a certain investigation mission. As for those who supported the troupe this time, on the Shanghai side there are Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Yu Hongjun, Huang Yanpei, Wu Kaixian, Wang Yansong, Zhang Zilian, etc. This exhibition is also the urging of Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Zhang Zilian as a farewell souvenir for the second distant tour.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Methods Become Increasingly Strange: Lead Ingots Turn into Silver: Three People Swindled One After Another: Two Swindlers Each Detained for Five Months</h3>
<p>Zhao Niu, a Suzhou native residing at No. 475 Pushi Road in the French Concession, and Qian Huilin, a Songjiang native living next door at No. 27, Lane 475, are both wandering vagrants who specialize in fraud. Their tricks are not leftovers, but are often invented. In the past half year, the most common technique they have used is the technique of melting lead ingots into silver to swindle money from the general populace. Such as Ding Jinkang, who lives in the Southern Yao area of Hedde Road, Hou Rongsheng, the son of Hou Yuxiang, a resident of Panjiazhai in Xujiahui, and Zhu Zhijing, who lives at No. 67, Lane 546, Tiantong Road, have all lost money after being deceived by their words. Among them,</p>
<h3>The Hou Family (Father and Son)</h3>
<p>lost the most, reaching 325 yuan. Zhu lost 45 yuan, and Ding only 30 yuan. When these people used their tricks on Ding, they first showed him a lead ingot that looked like a Ding Sheng cake, claiming that it was raw silver, just excavated from Dongting Mountain. There were many such silver blocks in the mountain. If they were excavated, they would be easy to pick up. However, they needed labor costs, so they were unable to mine it. If they got funds, they would determine the time of excavation and the quantity of output based on the amount of funding. In order to strengthen Ding's confidence, they took a stove and lit a fire, crushed a corner of the so-called raw silver lead ingot, stored it in a container, and placed it on the stove fire to melt it. Later, they took it to a silver shop to estimate its composition. According to them,</p>
<h3>It Was Indeed Pure Silver</h3>
<p>Ding's suspicion vanished and his desire for profit suddenly moved him to promise to pay for the cost of mining. He collected 30 yuan and gave it all to them. These people then pretended to show their trust by giving Ding three lead ingots as collateral. They were extremely cunning. Once the lead ingot was smelted, it turned into pure silver. There was no mysterious effect in this, but rather the agility of the hand. They had pre-prepared several small pieces of raw silver in the bag in their sleeves. When the lead ingot was crushed and thrown into the container, they slightly displayed a trick to make the deceived person pay less attention. Then they exchanged the silver block for the lead block to complete the work. By the time Ding realized afterward that what he had received was lead and not silver, the swindlers had already</p>
<h3>Vanished Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Aside from reporting to the police station, there was no way to recover the loss. He could only sigh in vain. The circumstances of the Hou family being swindled were the same as Ding's. However, Zhu Zhijing seemed to be willingly caught in the snare. Zhu had spare rooms for rent. The swindler happened to pass by his door, so he went inside to look at the house. Zhu saw that he was holding a lead ingot, so he asked about it. The swindler realized that this person had already fallen into his trap, so he said the same things to him as he had said to Ding, and said that he had come to rent the house as a silver smelting site, and fabricated all sorts of lies about how superior the benefits were. Zhu indeed</p>
<h3>Was Greatly Deceived</h3>
<p>He gave them 45 yuan. A few days ago, Inspector Cai Liu and Detective Liu Chunshu of the Gordon Road Police Station first arrested Zhao Niu on Xinzha Road, and then went to Qian's house to arrest Qian Huilin. Qian Huilin, along with the lead ingots turned in by Ding Jinkang, were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday. Judge Huang Risheng brought them to trial. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that the two defendants had used fraudulent means to swindle money from Ding and others, and that the facts were confirmed by witnesses, and requested that they be punished according to law. Subsequently, Ding, Hou, and Zhu, the three swindled people, filed a case to prove the circumstances at the time. Questioning Zhao and Qian, the two criminals remained silent. Judge Huang immediately announced the verdict, sentencing each to five months of imprisonment as a warning, and confiscating the lead ingots.</p>
<h3>Abandoned After Initial Infatuation: Ding Handu Accused: Cohabitation Agreement, Oaths of Eternal Love: Discarded After Time, Like an Autumn Fan: The Sad Story of Ms. He Ruidi</h3>
<p>Ding Handu, the young owner of a money shop, is currently 28 years old and works at McGao Foreign Company at No. 29 Sichuan Road. In the spring of last year, he met He Ruidi, a woman from Ningbo. At that time, the woman was only 21 years old, with a graceful figure and beautiful appearance. He fell in love at first sight and became close friends. After a considerable period of time, their love also reached a boiling point. Because Ms. He did not have a fixed residence, Ding made a further move, requesting to cohabitate. Ms. He also agreed, and they built a golden house at No. 5, Baoanfang, behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession, as a</p>
<h3>place to hide his beauty</h3>
<p>Oaths of eternal love, feelings were harmonious. At that time, in order to win He's trust, Ding wrote a document, stating that if he abandoned her midway, Ding would be willing to compensate her with one thousand yuan for living expenses, to be received and held by He. After obtaining the document, He was secretly delighted, thinking that she would have lifelong support and no worries for the future. Therefore, she lived with Ding at ease. Later, because the address was small, they moved to No. 26, Daodeli, Beile Road. At that time, Ding's father controlled all his property rights, so he was quite short of money.</p>
<h3>Had Considerable Savings</h3>
<p>Therefore, all expenses and household expenses were borne by He. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scenery did not last long, and a storm suddenly arose in the river of love, and the feelings of the past were all gone, until they each refused to give way, and went to court. Ding Handu's father suddenly died, and all the inheritance was inherited by Ding. Once he had great power and was able to make ends meet, and also knowing that He Ruidi's savings had been almost exhausted over the years, the love had waned, and he suddenly changed his usual state, constantly</p>
<h3>indulging in prostitution</h3>
<p>His footprints became sparse, and he even disappeared completely. He, because all her clothes had been pawned and there was no way to borrow money, had to look for him everywhere, running around all day long, hoping to meet Ding again, or to regain his heart and renew their old relationship. On October 17, He's mother found out that Ding was entertaining in Room 119 of the Jielu Hotel on Xizang Road, and rushed to look for him. She indeed found him there, so she questioned him and asked for household living expenses. Unexpectedly, Ding not only refused, but also</p>
<h3>Beating He's Mother</h3>
<p>Causing a head injury and fainting to the ground. Ding took the opportunity to escape. When He woke up and saw that the building was empty, she could not help but feel great grief. Ding had a tiger and wolf heart (having defiled her body, defrauded her of her wealth, and finally abandoned her without care, not only not allowed by law, but also not allowed by morality). In a fit of anger, she hired lawyer Li Mo to accuse Ding Handu of abandonment under Article 309 of the Criminal Code in the First Special District Court, requesting that the defendant be summoned to court and</p>
<h3>Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>and to file a civil suit, ordering him to compensate the plaintiff for the savings, clothes, and other expenses used up, as well as the 20,000 yuan specified in the contract. The court accepted the complaint and ordered that the defendant be summoned and scheduled for questioning in the Fifth Criminal Court by Judge Huang Risheng yesterday afternoon. The defendant did not arrive, but lawyers Yan Guoshi and Wang Weizhen arrived in court to defend him. After Judge Huang briefly questioned the plaintiff He Ruidi, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for further questioning on the afternoon of December 9.</p>
<h3>Water Company Letter to Real Estate Association: Newly Set Fee Payment Method</h3>
<p>Since the British Water Company changed to using water meters, water fees have doubled. Property owners are unable to bear the extra water fees, so they refuse to pay, causing disputes. The Real Estate Association negotiated with the Water Company and issued a water usage record form for property owners to fill out and send to the association to clarify the actual situation. Recently, property owners have been sending in the completed record forms to the association, so that they can be submitted to the upcoming Water Fee Arbitration Committee. Yesterday, the Water Company also sent a letter to the association, detailing various methods of collecting fees for water meter usage and the levels for paying deposit cabinet fees. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, according to the current water fee collection method, the owner of each district's house may request the company to enter into contracts with the individual houses within the house and the residents thereof, but the house owner must bear the cost of all necessary replacements on the water pipes, and pay a cash deposit cabinet to the company, the amount of which must be sufficient to offset the total value of each water meter, then the company can handle it. This deposit cabinet fee will be refunded when the house is transferred to a new owner, or when the water meter is removed. Regarding the deposit cabinet fee part of the above method, a reduced collection standard can now be adopted, that is, each half-inch (1-2) water meter will be charged a deposit cabinet fee of 47 yuan, and each 3/8-inch (8-8) water meter will be charged a deposit cabinet fee of 33 yuan. The amount of 47 yuan, calculated at an annual interest rate of 6%, is 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen, that is, 2 jiao and 3 fen and 5 li per month. Therefore, the owner of the house, if there is a situation where the water usage in the house of the resident is excessive, it is permissible to consider the remedial measure of installing separate water meters. Because after installing separate water meters, the responsibility for water fees is no longer borne, the rent can be reduced, then under these circumstances, it should not be difficult to find a way to compensate for this low interest amount. As for why it is necessary to collect a deposit cabinet fee, the opinion of our company is that if a deposit cabinet fee is not collected, and all users are allowed to install water meters at the company's expense, then in order to compensate for this cost, the company will</p>
<p>have to specially increase the charging price for domestic water usage. Moreover, our company has now decided to adopt a trial method. The separate water meters are usually installed outdoors, but now we are trying to put the water meter in a small iron box and install it near the water faucet inside each house. The cost of this installation method on the water pipe is particularly low, but if this trial method is not proper in fact in the future, then the usual method will be used to modify the water pipe so that the water meter can be installed outside the house, and the owner needs to bear all the modification costs. Our company, according to the method of separate water meter installation mentioned in the first section of this letter, has existed since the implementation of the water meter system, but in fact, the number of owners who use this separate installation method is not the majority, so our company has not prepared many small water meters in stock, so if there are too many requests for separate water meter installation, it can only be processed gradually. This is specially reported."</p>
<h3>Beauty Rafael Rises to a High Pole Today: Hopes to Sit for Seventy-Seven Days and Four Hours</h3>
<p>American Rafael, the creator of the high pole sitting record, competed with Mr. Kailai in Daxi City, America, and broke the record with a long period of 77 days and nights. Mr. Rafe also sat on a high pole in Mingyuan for 49 days last autumn, which surprised the people of Shanghai. Upon the invitation of the Daqian World Amusement Park at No. 2, Shengmu Yuan Road, he is scheduled to ascend a 75-foot high pole starting at 9 PM tonight to test his endurance record. It is said that he hopes to sit for 77 days and four hours before landing.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Cracks Down on Privately Owned Rickshaws Soliciting Passengers: And Asks the Public for Assistance in Banning Them</h3>
<p>In the Public Concession, there are now privately owned rickshaws soliciting passengers everywhere, commonly called "Wild Chicken" charter cars. These rickshaw pullers often forge the names of the owners and fraudulently obtain licenses for privately owned rickshaws. There are also genuine charter car pullers who solicit passengers without their owners' knowledge in order to earn "extra money." These vehicles not only constitute unfair competition with public rickshaws (yellow rickshaws), but also increase traffic obstacles. The Public Works Bureau will now crack down on them and hopes for the public's assistance. First, immediately refuse to ride in these charter cars when encountered, and report to the nearby police. Second, charter car owners should try to prevent their pullers from soliciting passengers privately and consider whether their wages are sufficient to avoid providing an excuse. As for the Public Works Bureau, in the future, it will strictly check the names and addresses of the owners when applying for charter car licenses. If falsification is discovered, the license will be revoked immediately. It is hoped that the public will provide assistance at any time, which will not only benefit social order, but also provide a small supplement to the livelihood of yellow rickshaw pullers.</p>

<h3>Industrial Accident Statistics: Public Concession November Report</h3>
<p>According to reports from the Public Works Bureau Police Department and the Emergency Ambulance, industrial and occupational accidents in the Public Concession in November resulted in 7 deaths and 32 injuries. Among the injured, 22 were men and 10 were women. Among the dead, two were electrocuted, two were killed by the explosion and fire of dangerous goods, one fell from the elevator shaft because the elevator did not have an interlocking mechanism, so the iron door could be opened even when the elevator was not on that floor, and another fell from the scaffolding at the construction site.

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Agrees on Method for Taxicab Security Deposits; Trade Association Notifies All Car Companies After Receiving Approval Yesterday; Each Car Must Pay 200 Yuan in Full Before Being Licensed</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the taxicab trade association petitioning the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to change the third-party insurance requirement for automobiles to a security deposit system, the Bureau, after joint discussion with the Public Safety and Social Affairs Bureaus, has granted approval and revised four items. Yesterday, upon receiving approval, the association immediately notified its members to comply. The method is recorded below as a notification: Regarding the matter of notification, the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's No. 925 decree states: "Received and noted. This case has been jointly discussed by representatives from the Public Safety Bureau, this Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau, and the following has been decided: (1) The original order requiring commercial vehicles to carry third-party insurance was established to protect victims' losses. The trade association's request to change to a security deposit system is consistent with the goal of compensating for losses of life and property of victims. The various difficulties in obtaining third-party insurance mentioned by the association are also not without reason and should be approved. (2) The original proposal to have each commercial vehicle pay a security deposit of only 20 yuan is too small. In the event of a major accident, it may not be sufficient to provide protection. The security deposit should be changed to 200 yuan per vehicle. However, given the varying economic conditions of each car company, it can be paid in five installments starting in 1933. (3) The above security deposit should be collected by the trade association and deposited into the Municipal Bank jointly with the competent authorities. In the future, if funds are needed to compensate for third-party losses, the association should submit a request to the competent bureau to jointly withdraw the funds from the Municipal Bank for payment. However, the association will be responsible for replenishing any withdrawn funds from the car company responsible for the accident within one month. (4) Starting in January 1934, when commercial vehicles in this city apply for license plates from the Public Utilities Bureau each quarter, they must present a certificate from the association proving that the car company has paid the first year's security deposit before a license plate will be issued. This procedure will be followed thereafter." In addition to reporting the above to the Municipal Government for record, this decree is hereby issued for the trade association to comply with, and the first year's security deposit must be collected and reported to this Bureau within ten days of receipt of this notice for joint deposit. Upon receipt of this, in addition to filing it for record, we hereby copy the original text and order all members to comply. This is specially notified. Shanghai Taxicab Trade Association.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Shipping Bureau Requests the "Chao Wu" Warship to Move Berth Because it Obstructs the Waterway</h3>
<p>The "Chao Wu" warship, belonging to the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Department and under the jurisdiction of the Ningbo Defense Command, patrols the eastern Zhejiang coast. Last winter, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xinfeng" steamer, replacing the "Xinjiangtian" on the Ningbo route, collided with the "Chao Wu" warship upon entering Zhenhai, resulting in damage to both sides and leading to a major dispute. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation and consulted with the Offshore Department to reach a settlement. A year has passed, and it is said that it has not yet been concluded. Since the incident, the "Chao Wu" warship has also moved its berthing location.</p>
<p>Difficult Navigation for Ningbo Steamers</p>
<p>Recently, the owners of the Shanghai-Ningbo steamers "Xin Ningshao" and "Xin Jiangtian," etc., reported to the Shanghai Shipping Bureau that the "Chao Wu" warship has recently moved and docked in the port of Zhenhai, obstructing the waterway between Shanghai and Ningbo. With the slightest carelessness, a collision could occur. All shipowners have reported to the Shanghai Shipping Bureau, requesting the company to send a letter to negotiate and ask the warship to move away as soon as possible, otherwise the Ningbo steamers will not be able to enter the port of Zhenhai. Ning Shao China Merchants believes that this matter is of great importance to navigation safety and sent a formal letter yesterday to discuss it.</p>
<p>Please Move Berth Quickly</p>
<p>Ning Shao China Merchants, etc., jointly sent a letter yesterday to the Ningbo Defense Commander, stating that since the collision between the "Xinfeng" and "Chao Wu" warship, the "Chao Wu" has not been berthing in Zhenhai but moved to another location. The warship has recently moved back to the port of Zhenhai, obstructing the waterway. It is not only hindering navigation but also prone to accidents. It is requested that the warship be ordered to move away as soon as possible to facilitate navigation and avoid danger. If the warship continues to berth in the port, the Shanghai-Ningbo steamers will not call at the port of Zhenhai for safety reasons.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cable Buried in Pudong</h3>

Now that the cable has been shipped from England to Shanghai, construction will begin soon. Chinese signs stating "Submarine Cable Crossing, No Anchoring" have been placed on both sides of the cable-laying site. English signs stating "Cable Crossing" are also being installed. It is expected that they will be completed soon where the cable is buried. For fear that ships coming and going will arbitrarily anchor there, causing damage to the cable and hindering water and electricity traffic, all responsibility and compensation will be borne by the ship. Please inform accordingly. Separate letters have also been sent to foreign merchant shipping companies, asking them not to anchor at the cable burial site to respect electricity policy.</p>

<h3>Red Pill Shareholders' List Found at Li Maosong's House on Beller Road; Largest Investment Exceeds 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Inspectorate, and Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and Song Bingzheng previously uncovered a large-scale red pill drug manufacturing operation at No. 9 Nanzun Road, detaining ten workers, including Wu Qingsheng and Tan Afu, and a Japanese man, Doki Abe. They confiscated a large quantity of red pills and raw materials. Abe was sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. Wu Qingsheng and the others were handed over to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, the police obtained from Li Maosong, a shareholder of the operation at No. 61 Beller Road in the French Concession, and Tan Chutang, a shareholder at No. 21 Xiafei Road, two more people from Ningbo, Wang Chengen, and a Cantonese man, Yang Changsheng. Several bags of red pill drugs and several documents were found at Li Maosong's house. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court, where police lawyer Zhang Tianyin claimed that a change of date had been made. The investigation found that the house at No. 9 Nanzun Road was rented by a Japanese man, Nan Yoshiro, with an introduction from a Japanese man, Nobukichi Hayashi, at a monthly rent of 125 yuan. The Japanese consulate has dispatched detectives to arrest him. According to documents seized at Li Maosong's house, the shareholders of the operation were Li Maosong with 12,750 yuan, Tan Chutang with 6,600 yuan, Kong Qianji with 2,700 yuan, and Li Changji with 950 yuan, totaling 23,000 yuan. It was named the Sihe Company, and the red pill brands were Xianma and Jinlong. The Japanese man, Doki Abe, lived at No. 1123 Broadway Road. Police detectives went to his place and found 75 rubber bags, which were used to package Jinlong brand red pills. Xianma brand was packaged in paper. The loft of the house was used by Abe to store the manufactured red pills as a warehouse. The rubber bags have been sent to the Japanese consulate. The red pill materials seized at Li Maosong's house have been sent to the Chemistry Department of the Public Works Department for examination. The defendants Wu Qingsheng and the other ten fully admitted last time that they were working in the red pill group. Wang Chengen was introduced to Li Maosong by Yang Changsheng and worked in the company making red pills, with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. The other defendants received only ten yuan or so. Yang Changsheng had previously seen newspaper reports about the No. 9 Nanzun Road operation being raided by the police. Because he was close to Tan Chutang, he lived at Li Maosong's place and, upon learning of it, rushed to Tan's place to report the arrest. The stock list seized at Li's place was presented for inspection. When Wu Qingsheng and the other ten were questioned, their statements were similar to their previous admissions. Wang Chengen testified that he was introduced to Li Maosong by Yang Changsheng and a Mr. Chen and worked at the operation, earning 30 yuan a month. He could make about 10,000 large or small red pills every night, about 15 or 16 bags. The boss, Li Maosong, would sometimes come to the company to supervise the production. Tan Chutang was also a shareholder. Yang Changsheng testified that he rented a pavilion room at Li Maosong's place, paying 10 yuan in rent. In the past, he had seen Japanese people come but did not bring red pills. He gave evasive answers to other questions. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that they be remanded in custody and scheduled a pronouncement of judgment.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of a Vegetable Boat Sinking in the Wind; Boat Owner Shi Hongchun Drowned on the Spot</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei sand boat Shi Changtai, Shanghai Customs imprint No. 560, loaded with 6,000 heads of Chinese cabbage from Taiping Port in Jiangbei to Shanghai for sale. At 6:00 PM the other day, it arrived at the Sanjiashui Estuary in Wusong. At that time, it encountered a sudden storm. The boat's helmsman, because the boat was too heavily loaded, steered towards the West Bank to avoid the wind and waves. Unexpectedly, the bottom of the boat hit a stone embankment, breaking a large hole. Instantly, the cabin flooded, and the boat sank immediately. The passengers, crew, and others, a total of seven people, fell into the sea with the boat. They swam to escape for their lives. When they were near the shore, they were fortunately rescued by people. Six of the crew and passengers were able to survive. However, the boat owner, Shi Hongchun, 24 years old, tragically drowned on the spot. His body has not yet been recovered. After the crew and others were rescued, they immediately reported to Xu Jinji in Song. After hearing the report, the head of the tax firm, Xu Xigeng, immediately hired a small tugboat to go to the scene of the accident and tried to salvage the sunken boat and tow it to Yuncao Creek. It was found that most of the vegetables loaded had been lost, and the boat was also severely damaged. The loss of the boat and cargo was very large. The crew has already reported the situation to the boat owner and is waiting for the boat owner's wife to come to Shanghai to deal with it. It is said that the boat owner's wife is only 19 years old. Upon hearing this bad news, it was like a bolt from the blue. The tragic situation is beyond description.</p>
<h3>Stock Broker Swindles 60,000 Yuan in Treasury Bonds; Yuan Qinsun Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Yuan Qinsun, a native of Ningbo, was a broker at the Dingyu Securities Firm at No. 413 Zhaofu Lane, Hankou Road. Recently, due to economic pressure and heavy debts, he came up with a whimsical idea, falsely claiming that Dunyu Qianzhuang (a money shop) wanted to purchase twelve 20-year Salt Tax Treasury Bonds, with a face value of 5,000 yuan each, totaling 60,000 yuan, worth 27,000 yuan at market price. The owner of the firm, Liu Yunpan, believed him to be true and purchased twelve Treasury Bonds from the stock exchange. On the 29th of last month, he handed the bonds to Yuan to be delivered to Dunyu Qianzhuang. Unexpectedly, after Yuan obtained the bonds,</p>
<p>he disappeared without a trace. Liu became suspicious and inquired with Dunyu, and found that there was no such transaction. He immediately reported it to the General Police Station, requesting an investigation. Detectives Han Shoushan and Wu Yaozu went to Yuan's residence at No. 19 Fansheng Lane, Xihua Road, to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Yuan had moved his entire family to another location on the 25th, and his whereabouts were unknown. However, according to his roommate, Yuan had hired a moving company truck to move his furniture at that time. The detectives then investigated various moving companies and learned that the Zhoujiazu Road China Moving Company had transported the furniture to No. 46 Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession. The detectives went to the address and arrested Yuan, confiscating the stolen Treasury Bonds. One bond had already been sold, netting 2,100 yuan. After spending 200 yuan, he deposited 1,200 yuan, and the rest was cash, all of which was confiscated by the detectives and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the circumstances and requested that he be punished according to law for the crime of embezzlement. When Yuan was questioned, he confessed without denial. Qian Hongye, the Criminal Division Judge, verified the confession and immediately announced the judgment in court: Yuan Qinsun committed fraud to obtain property and was sentenced to three months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Case of a Pedestrian Killed by a Falling Tree; | Appeal Hearing Today |</h3>
<p>Chen Ronggui, 38 years old, a native of Suzhou, resided in the old schoolyard in the new north gate of the South City in Shanghai, and worked at the German company Meyer &amp; Co. on Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. On May 12th of this year at 5:00 PM, after finishing his work, he was returning home. While walking in front of the old Jiatai Tea Shop at No. 46 Laobeimen Street in the French Concession, a giant wooden log, more than ten feet long, suddenly fell from the roof of the third floor of the shop, hitting him in the head. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but died due to his serious injuries. The court examined the body. The tea shop's staff came to the case and admitted that it was indeed the wooden log falling from the roof of the shop that caused the death. The deceased's 67-year-old mother, Chen Zhang, and his wife, Chen Huang, filed a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, claiming that he left behind a family of ten men, women, old and young, whose future life was dependent. They requested that the defendants be punished according to law and, incidentally, a civil lawsuit, and that they be ordered to compensate for all relevant losses. Unexpectedly, the deceased's wife, Chen Huang, became ill and gave birth to a stillborn child due to grief over her husband's tragic death. After the Second Special Court summoned the case for cross-examination, it initially only ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation. Then, it judged the defendant not guilty. The plaintiff was not satisfied, and Chen Zhang and others still hired lawyer Zhu Gaorong to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The reasons for his rebuttal were several. According to the reporter's knowledge, the main points were roughly that "the giant wood was placed on the roof, according to the defendant's confession, for more than a year." "On the day of the accident, there was a strong wind, blowing down the giant wood. The plaintiff produced a handwritten certificate from the director of the Xujiahui Observatory, stating that there was no wind at all that day." They requested that justice be served. It is known that the Third Branch of the High Court, after receiving the petition, scheduled to summon the plaintiff and defendant to the case for trial at 3:00 PM today.</p>

It is now learned that the garment shop owner, Shen Linghua, suddenly hanged himself from a tree near Yaojia Stone Bridge at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The matter is quite bizarre. After the police station of the Third Section of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of the incident, they reported it to the director, Wen Yishan, who in turn reported it to the General Bureau. They immediately sent a patrol officer to investigate and ordered the local guarantor to request the court to send a prosecutor to examine the body yesterday.</p>

<p>Wireless Weekly</p>
<h3>Wireless Machines of 1950</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yizhi</p>
<p>Hugo Gernsback, editor-in-chief of the two major wireless magazines in the United States, Radio Craft and Short Wave Craft, is a polymath and quite famous in the wireless field. He recently published an article on the Radio Set of 1950 in Radio Craft magazine. Although it is a prediction and may not be reliable, it is based on his rich experience and excellent knowledge and speculation. It cannot be compared with a generation of empty generalizations. After reading this article, I was quite interested, so I excerpted the translation for the wireless comrades in our country to see. We will wait and see, or will we feel emotional and strive to catch up? — Translator's Note.</p>
<p>In the past few months, I have often been asked by Radio Craft readers what my guesses are about future wireless machines. I have made many predictions, and some have been accurate. At this time when the wireless machine industry is in a slump, I am afraid that the wireless comrades will not be surprised by what they want to know about the future wireless machines.</p>
<p>I believe that the future wireless machines in my speculation will not be too far away. However, I do not believe that they can be seen next year or within five years. When can this machine be seen? The earliest is probably in the early autumn of 1950.</p>
<p>The radio of 1950 is not a small, cigar box-style or pocket-sized one. This machine must be at least four feet high or higher. Because it can also receive wireless movies and has a screen, it must be very large.</p>
<p>The vacuum tubes inside the machine are heatless or electrodeless. The area is very small, I am afraid that it is not as large as a finger ring.</p>
<p>The machine base will be very different from today's. The parts (transformers, etc.) will not be fixed for the convenience of rapid repair. The installation method is like the current installation of vacuum tubes. They can be removed immediately. The sockets are like today's vacuum tube sockets or like bayonets. With just a twist of the wrist, the transformer or capacitor to be removed can be taken out. I have heard current engineers say that if the wiring is not firmly fixed, nothing can be heard except for bad noise. However, of the vacuum tubes, which are now called the soul of the wireless machine, which one is soldered? Therefore, in manufacturing, if the contact points are properly worked on in the arrangement, there will definitely be no difficult problems.</p>
<p>The vacuum tube itself has a more complicated structure and higher efficiency than today's. At that time, the real detection tube will definitely have been invented. Its efficiency will definitely be better than today's, and the sensitivity will definitely be increased several times as a percentage. Therefore, the 1950 machine does not need an antenna, does not need a ground wire, and external noise and static interference can be reduced. Each machine will be equipped with a correct filter brush丨not the filter used today, it can reduce the interference noise from the current power input line from 90% to 95%.</p>
<p>The loudspeakers on future machines will also be different from today's. Instead of magnetic or electric, they will use mineral or capacitor types, or a combination of the two. The 1950 machine will have many loudspeakers, each responsible for a certain fixed audio frequency, so that the high and low tones can be as realistic as the original sound.</p>
<p>In 1950, the current broadcast wavelength bands will all be cancelled. The broadcasting wavelength rate is below 200 meters. At that time, if wireless movies are successful, then the current broadcast wavelengths will be useless. The wireless movie broadcast wavelength is below 50 meters, and each station uses the same wavelength to broadcast both image and sound. This has been mentioned in my editor's notes, and in April 1932, the New York station of the Columbia Broadcasting System had completed the simultaneous broadcast of sound and image.</p>
<p>Future wireless movies will definitely make great progress. The broadcasting distance will be long, the lens will be clear, and the human figures will be realistic. All broadcasting stations will be able to broadcast color wireless movies. All can be received with the 1950 machine. The cheapest broadcasting machine broadcasts black and white. Good ones can broadcast the three primary colors of red, blue, and yellow, and various colors mixed from them.</p>
<p>The 1950 machine will all be made of all metal. To avoid external electrical interference, the entire machine will be sealed with metal. The back of the machine will not be opened like today, causing dust to enter.</p>
<h3>Electromagnetic Rectifier</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The sole mission of a rectifier is to convert alternating current (AC) into unidirectional direct current (DC). Currently, vacuum tube rectifiers are perhaps the most commonly used. Another type, called electrolytic rectifiers, is not widely used due to their large size and inconvenience for carrying.</p>
<p>The rectifier introduced in this article utilizes the electromagnetic principle of "like charges repel, opposite charges attract." The content is very simple and suitable for small-scale experiments. As shown in the first figure, M is a horseshoe permanent magnet, and V is a thin iron piece. When alternating current passes through the coil C, V becomes an electromagnet due to induction, with the same frequency as the alternating current (each cycle changes the north and south poles once; for example, if the frequency is 60, the north and south poles each change 60 times per second). Assuming that in a certain cycle, the A terminal of the upper half-cycle is the south pole (S), then S repels S, and at the same time, S is attracted to N on the left. Thus, the current generated by S2 (the secondary coil of the power transformer) can pass through at point X (see Figure 2A). In the lower half-cycle, the A terminal becomes the north pole (N), then N repels N, and N attracts S, so point X separates, and the current cannot pass through (see Figure 2B). As a result, the obtained half-wave unidirectional current is the same as that rectified by a diode vacuum tube (as shown in the curve).</p>
<p>In Figure 1, T is a doorbell transformer, and the secondary coil S1 is specifically for the current in the C coil. S2 is a 5-volt secondary coil. After rectification, if charging a 4-volt A battery, a current of about 2 amps can be obtained.</p>
<p>This article only describes the principle, and all sections are simplified. If the reader wants to expand the use of this device, such as charging A batteries with a large amount of current or B batteries with higher voltage, they only need to modify the power transformer. The other parts do not need to be moved. For detailed design of the power transformer, please refer to issues 9 and 10 of this publication.</p>
<p>Such electromagnetic rectifiers are also sold on the market, but most are fake. Buyers should pay attention.</p>
<p>Note: The DC voltage obtained after rectification must be higher than the battery's own voltage when there is no load for it to be applicable. For example, the voltage of a B battery should be around 45 volts. In short, when winding the secondary coil of the transformer, it is better to have more turns than fewer. If the voltage is too high, a resistor of appropriate value can be connected in series to adjust it. If it is too low, it must be unwound and rewound.</p>
<h3>Construction of a Mechanical Rectifier</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Charging requires a large amount of direct current. Besides DC generators, what is sold on the market is AC-to-DC chargers. Among homemade ones, mechanical rectifiers are the most suitable.</p>
<p>AA is a round soft iron bar, 25 mm in diameter and 100 mm long, wound with 1000 turns of #30 enameled wire, with wax paper insulation between each layer. #30 wire can pass a current of 0.067 amps, so a 300-ohm resistor is used to limit the current passing through. N is a piece of steel strip with strong magnetism, 10 mm wide and about 60 mm long, the thinner the better. A watch spring with magnetization can also be used. E is the fixed point of the steel strip. C is a small screw to adjust the distance between B and D. D is a triangular iron block, fixed on a wooden board for contact. F is a fuse. After all the wires are connected according to the diagram, it can be used. When alternating current passes through the coil along the dotted line arrow, a magnetic field is generated around it. According to the right-hand rule, the A end should be the north pole and A' the south pole. At the same time, because the end of the steel strip B close to A is the north pole, it is attracted, so it touches D. Thus, there is current passing through the RSD circuit, with the direction indicated by the curve arrow. Conversely, if the alternating current flows in the direction of the solid line arrow, the A end generates north pole magnetism and repels the steel strip B, so point D does not make contact, and there is no current passing through the RSD circuit. The direction of the alternating current changes constantly, so there is a constantly flowing, intermittently flowing, unidirectional current in the RSD circuit, thus completing the rectification process. The amount of direct current needed can be adjusted with R. If there is a suitable filtering device, it can also be used in place of a B battery or an A battery.</p>
<h3>Simple Method for Measuring Capacitance</h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>Measuring the capacitance of a capacitor requires a precise electrical meter. However, such meters are very expensive, and most amateurs do not have them. Therefore, homemade capacitors or those whose capacitance has been forgotten are often difficult to use in circuits because their capacitance cannot be determined. The method introduced here also does not require an electrical meter. The equipment used and the required procedures are very simple, making it suitable for amateurs. The circuit diagram is as follows.</p>
<p>In the diagram, V is a triode vacuum tube, T is an ordinary low-frequency transformer, P is its primary, S is its secondary, the A battery is at the specified value, the B battery can be arbitrary, R1 and R2 are two parts of a wire-wound potentiometer, C1 is a capacitor with known capacitance, H is a headset, and C2 is the capacitor to be measured.</p>
<p>During measurement, first adjust the potentiometer so that no sound is heard in the headset. At this point, the resistance and capacitance are related by the formula C1 × R1 = C2 × R2. Since R1, R2, and C1 are known values, the capacitance of C2 can be directly calculated using the formula C2 = (C1 × R1) ÷ R2.</p>
<p>If a 600-ohm potentiometer and a 2000-ohm headset are used with the above method to measure capacitors with a capacitance less than 0.005 MF, the measured value will not be very accurate. However, if a more sensitive headset and a potentiometer with a larger resistance are used, even capacitors with smaller capacitances can be measured. Using a higher-frequency low-frequency oscillator or increasing the B voltage can also achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>Note: If the circuit described in this article is not in use, the vacuum tube must be removed, or a switch must be added to the filament circuit to avoid wasting current. (Translated from the November issue of Radio Craft).</p>
<h3>Crystal Loudspeaker</h3>
<p>— Chongwu</p>
<p>Recently, there is a new type of loudspeaker that uses oscillating crystals to convert electrical energy into sound waves. This type of loudspeaker is different from ordinary types in that it does not have a magnet inside, relying entirely on the unique properties of crystals to work. A long time ago, radio engineers already knew about this phenomenon, that is, when a Rochelle Salt crystal is placed in an electrostatic magnetic field, oscillations immediately occur. This unique function is called the Piezoelectric effect, and it is now used to create effective loudspeakers.</p>
<p>In appearance, this loudspeaker is similar to the dynamic type, but the transformer and heavy magnet inside the dynamic type are replaced in the crystal loudspeaker by a very simple hollow circular chamber. Inside the chamber is a finely ground Rochelle Salt crystal, shaped like a small square, with three corners held in place by rubber clips, and the remaining corner is free to move, connected to the sound arm of the conical horn. In addition, two thin copper sheets are attached to both sides of the crystal to form two poles. When the pulsating current from the low-frequency amplifier in the radio is applied to these two copper sheets, which are similar to capacitors, the crystal twists and bends, resulting in a series of oscillations. Through the action of the triangular rubber clips, these oscillations are transmitted to the horn through the sound arm to form sound waves.</p>
<p>Compared with magnetic induction and dynamic loudspeakers, crystal loudspeakers have several advantages. The most important is that their structure is simple and not prone to failure. And because no magnet is needed inside, they are light and convenient. For example, the loudspeaker shown in the figure below weighs only two pounds and is less than three and a half inches thick. The loudspeaker shown in the figure below is only driven by a simple crystal. There are also many other styles, especially designed to meet the needs of public speaking and theaters. Inside, there are four crystal pieces, connected to each other to drive a horn or diaphragm.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this crystal loudspeaker is that it is particularly suitable for dual-loudspeaker setups. When it works side by side with a dynamic loudspeaker, the result is much better than using two dynamic loudspeakers side by side. Therefore, by extension, they are also very worthy of being adopted when multiple loudspeakers need to work side by side!</p>

<h3>AC/DC Radio</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more cities in the country are using alternating current, so AC radios can also be used in various places. However, except for a few large cities, most places do not have electricity supply, so AC radios are still not very suitable. If DC machines are used day and night, the procedures are extremely inconvenient and very uneconomical. The AC/DC dual-purpose machine described below can solve the above-mentioned difficulties. The circuit is very simple and suitable for homemade use. Those who are interested may wish to try it. In the figure, L1, L2, and L3 are ordinary three-circuit coils, and L4 is a center-tapped RFC for use, which can also be homemade. Use a one-inch tube to wind 800 turns of #36 wire, and tap a wire at 400 turns to connect to the crystal CD. The crystal must be purchased with the most sensitivity. The volume of this machine depends entirely on the quality of the crystal, and it must be fixed to avoid the trouble of adjustment. VC1 is an ordinary 21-plate variable capacitor. VC2 is a small 13-plate variable capacitor, used to adjust regeneration. T1 and T2 are 3:1 low-frequency transformers. V1, V2, and V3 are all RCA 201 (similar to Byrd 401 and Philips 509). C1 is a 0.002 fixed capacitor. C2 are each 2 MFD, and C3 is 1 MFD. HFC is a 30-henry low-frequency choke coil. The secondary of an ordinary low-frequency transformer can also be used as a substitute. R is 1500 ohms. R1 is a 6-ohm variable resistor, and R2 is a 200-ohm voltage divider. PT is a power transformer, which can also be homemade. S is a switch, and S1 is a triple-pole double-throw switch. Please pay attention to the following points when manufacturing:</p>
<p>(1) This circuit is a regenerative type.</p>
<p>Therefore, each component must be very good.</p>
<p>(2) The power supply must be placed separately from the radio to reduce noise.</p>
<p>(3) The primary of the power transformer must be determined according to the local voltage. If the voltage is not accurate, you must wind more taps to adjust it.</p>
<p>(4) Within 100 miles of the radio station, you can use a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>(5) If you want to increase the volume when using AC, V2 can be changed to RC112AA.</p>
<p>(6) Use a 6-volt 100-amp storage battery and a 90-volt dry battery for DC. If AC and DC are used interchangeably, it can be used for three or four months.</p>

<p>(20) Overview of Vacuum Tubes (4)</p>
<p>(7) AC Vacuum Tubes: The various vacuum tubes described previously are all DC types, which can be used in DC radios but not in AC radios. However, since the invention of AC vacuum tubes, the shortcomings of the past have been eliminated, and the speed of their development has been rapid, making today's era of all-powerful AC radios. Originally, old DC vacuum tubes (such as UX201) would often generate a kind of noise - commonly known as AC hum - when the A battery was removed and replaced with an A eliminator to supply AC from the lighting line to the vacuum tube filament, disrupting the correct sound and making it unusable. AC vacuum tubes improve the filament so that it can be used for AC without the risk of generating AC hum. This type of AC vacuum tube is divided into two types due to the different structures of the filament: directly heated AC tubes and indirectly heated AC tubes. The different structures are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(A) Directly Heated AC Tubes: The biggest cause of AC hum is the change in temperature and the change in the potential difference between the grid and the filament. Directly heated AC tubes improve these two phenomena to minimize their changes. The filament of the tube uses an oxide-coated material to increase its heat sensitivity, and the current is increased to reduce the supply voltage Ef, and the change in the potential difference between the grid and the filament is also minimized. Other parts are almost the same as DC tubes. For example, UX226 and UX245 are one type of directly heated tube, and the specifications of the UX226 tube are roughly the same as the DC tube UX201A, but its AC hum is reduced to one-tenth.</p>
<p>(B) Indirectly Heated AC Tubes: Indirectly heated tubes separate the two functions of the filament - heating and emission - so that they are performed separately. The part that performs the heating function is called the filament or heater, and the part that performs the emission function is called the cathode. For example, UY227 and UY224 are one type of indirectly heated tube. The above figure shows the structure of the heating part and the cathode.</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony: The opening ceremony was held at 9 am on the 1st. After the ceremony was completed, Chairman Zhu Jianbai first reported on the main purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that social education is based on social needs. In China, where culture and production are backward, social education is very necessary. There is no doubt. However, social education has not been fully promoted in society because the goals of social education have not been fully understood, and some people still have a skeptical attitude. But this kind of misunderstanding and suspicion, as long as we engage in social education with practical, hard work and show real results, the facts will be eloquent, and all doubts in society can be understood, and society can be deeply understood. But this matter relies on everyone's concerted efforts, walking correctly, the method must be economical, and the steps must be neat. The association hopes to gather research efforts, hoping that everyone will jointly discover great power and achieve good results, etc. Then, Xiang Jutan, the director of the Education Department, gave a speech, briefly stating that Jiangsu's holding of social education sub-regional research meetings is a new production. Judging from the sub-regional meetings held in Yixing Qingjiang Qianfa Xuzhou, Jiangsu, the spirit of research is very good, and the future of social education is promising. This kind of research is originally one of the guiding methods. The main purpose of this meeting is to increase the strength, and to take a unified step. The Education Department previously announced the standard working methods of the central organs of the public education areas in various counties of Jiangsu, and its motivation was to see that some counties have not done the public education work, or have done it improperly. Therefore, the key points of the plan are to do it in steps and to do what is more urgently needed. The basic teaching area focuses on livelihood education, language education, civic education, and health education, in order to achieve the purpose of national salvation education. He also said that the social education institutions hope that the minimum standard of 2,000 yuan for the 22nd year can be achieved. Then, he also gave a general account of his examination of the achievements of public education in various places and the matters that should be paid attention to, as a reference, hoping that members will have the spirit of hard work and strive for progress in the future of social education. Then, Peng Baichuan, the director of the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, gave a speech, briefly stating that in China, where illiteracy has not been eradicated, especially in China, which is now in a critical state, the implementation of social education should be vigorously promoted to develop social education. However, social education is an emerging career in China and must be researched, tested, and guided. In the past, it was all passive remedial education. Since 16 years of the Republic of China, social education has been actively carried out. However, active implementation must have results to demonstrate social belief. The implementation method is not effective without research. The members of this association are all personnel who actually implement social education. They should cooperate in the division of labor for various issues of social education experiments and research, and there will be good methods in the future to promote them to the fullest. The future of public education is very promising. He also said that the sub-regional research on social education is Jiangsu's initiative. There are standard working methods and guiding methods. The Ministry of Education can adopt them and distribute them to various provinces and cities for imitation. He then reported on the establishment of a Public Education Committee by the Ministry of Education, the drafting of public education programs, and the convening of a meeting next month to discuss the elimination of illiteracy, set the standard of social education funds, and important matters of social education handled by the Ministry of Education. Then, Xu Mingqiu from the Capital Public Education Center, Ren Yingpei from the Social Affairs Bureau, Lv Jindong from the Municipal Party Department, Xue Jianwu from Nanjing Middle School, and Liu Yimou from the National Library gave speeches one after another. Then, the member representatives gave speeches, and then Chairman Zhu Jianbai gave a speech in reply. It was already 12 o'clock in the afternoon, and the preparatory meeting and discussion meeting to discuss the central research issues were held at 1 pm, based on the province. The method of realizing the standard work with the focus of the Nanjing Public Education Center on the work of the museum was passed as follows: (A) The whole facility focuses on language education, livelihood education, and civic education. (B) In terms of various educational aspects, (1) livelihood education focuses on agricultural guidance, vocational training, promoting side industries, and cooperation.

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Education Association, etc., notified their subordinates yesterday to participate in today's citizens' anti-rebellion congress. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Education Bureau The Education Bureau ordered its subordinates, stating that it received Instruction No. 7825 from the Municipal Government, which stated that it approved the public letter from the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which stated that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, etc., took advantage of the serious internal and external troubles and national crisis to collude with the Communist Party, organize a government, betray the party and the country, and harm the people. All Chinese people are deeply outraged. If they are not severely punished, how can the party and the country be safe and the law and discipline be upheld? The association has specially convened various groups in the city to discuss and decided to hold the Shanghai Citizens' Anti-Rebellion Congress at the Public Sports Field on Dalin Road at 2:00 pm on December 2 (Saturday). It is hereby informed that all sections and all staff of the bureaus under your jurisdiction should stop working on that day as usual and should attend the meeting at the time.

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Reprimands Taihu Middle School for Establishing Junior High School Without Authorization, Which is Illegal, and Orders the Cancellation of the Second and Third Grade Classes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Private Taihu Junior Middle School and Primary School, stating that according to the complaint filed by Min Danwei, the founder of the school, the school's management is improper and the measures are erroneous, and he requested to resign as the founder. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate, and the report briefly stated that, in general, there are many students in the school, and five private houses are rented. There is no open space nearby, which is quite crowded. The light in the classrooms is mostly unsuitable, and the spirit of the teachers in class is not active, and their abilities are weak. Regarding the consumer cooperative and the school accounts, they cannot be publicly distributed, which seems inappropriate. There are complaints about the female teacher Ying in the outside world, so it is advisable to order the school board to find a way to rehire. The junior high school has been opened for less than a year, and it has illegally recruited second and third grade students, so it should be severely reprimanded and ordered to be corrected to comply with the law. Based on this, the junior high school has not been reported to the bureau for record, and it has been established without authorization. It has been opened for less than a year, and it has recruited second and third grade students without authorization, which are all violations of laws and regulations and should be reprimanded. The school must immediately follow the prescribed procedures to apply for establishment and cancel the second and third grade classes. The school must report for verification, otherwise it will be banned. In addition, the school buildings are too crowded, the light in the classrooms is unsuitable, the teaching spirit is not active, and the economy is not open, all of which are inappropriate. The principal should take separate and practical improvement measures and report for verification.</p>
<h3>New Construction of the Physical Education Department of the Patriotic Girls' School</h3>
<p>Qingyuan, Jiangwan Road, is very beautiful and has a peaceful atmosphere, which is suitable for reading and sports. The Physical Education Department of the Patriotic Girls' School is located here. The department has a long history and has long been known for its reputation. The January 28th Incident suffered a heavy blow. After the war, Li Jiyuan from Beiping was specially hired as the director to actively revive it. On the occasion of the school's 32nd anniversary today, the past situation and future plans of the department are described in detail below:</p>
<p>Historical Evolution The Physical Education Department was added by the school in the third year of the Republic of China. At the beginning, Mr. McLelland, an American physical education expert, was hired to plan everything. The purpose was to cultivate female physical education teachers for primary and secondary schools. The initial duration of study was half a year. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to two years, and in the nineteenth year, it was changed to a three-year system. Graduates who serve society are all over the country and abroad. In the past national games, provincial games, and the Far Eastern Games held in Shanghai, the department participated in group performances and won honors. Dance, national arts, volleyball, basketball, and track and field events also have good results. The Girls' Junior Army was also the first to be founded by the school in the country (in the eighth year of the Republic of China). The current commander is Ms. Huang Shan. The honor of this grand review and grand camp is a sincere matter.</p>
<p>Overview of Revival After the war, it moved back to its original site and rebuilt its foundation. The outline is as follows: A. Equipment (1) The gymnasium is completed, 70 feet long and 40 feet wide, suitable for women's basketball court. It is equipped with volleyball and softball fields. The equipment includes ribbed bars, horizontal bars, parallel bars, hanging ladders, hanging ropes, hanging wooden horses, jumping boxes, handstand racks, balance beams, chest expanders, springboards, etc., all of which are complete. The attached changing rooms, storage rooms, and storage rooms are also very complete. (2) The increase in sports fields. The track and field track is 180 meters long around the perimeter. Jumping pits, iron ball circles, etc. are all complete. All kinds of sports are very suitable. The lawn tennis court and hard tennis court are well arranged and suitable for winter and summer. The new dormitory is equipped with a handball court, and the South Courtyard is equipped with a basketball and volleyball court. With this equipment, the Physical Education Department of the Shanghai Girls' School has benefited a lot in teaching.</p>
<p>Curriculum The curriculum of the department is revised according to the needs of the society and the physical education normal school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. For technical subjects, the Technical Subjects Teaching Materials Committee separately formulates a technical subject teaching material outline and a technical subject testing standard. The outline and testing standard will be published in the physical education quarterly magazine compiled by the department for research with modern physical education experts.</p>
<p>Implementation of Teaching The department is now divided into three classes. The courses are taught with strictness, life emphasizes discipline, and attention is paid to the cleanliness of the residence, the neatness of the uniform, and extracurricular exercise. Lectures, parties, reading clubs and other activities are all presided over by the student self-government association and are guided and supervised by the director. Regarding gymnastics, Mr. Chen Fen is currently teaching it, and the lessons are rigorous. In just a few months, he has achieved remarkable results. The school's physical education focuses on popularity. Morning exercises are divided into three types: ordinary exercises, track and field sports, and Taijiquan. Principal Sun is particularly good at teaching Taijiquan.</p>
<p>Three-Year Plan Director Li of the department formulated a three-year plan at the beginning of the revival. The results that are currently being announced are the success of the first year plan.

<h3>Municipal Wuben Affiliated Elementary School's Mother and Sister Association Today</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, the Municipal Wuben Affiliated Elementary School has expanded its studies and improved its equipment, and school affairs are thriving. In this semester, in addition to continuing to focus on health education as the center of the previous semester, more attention is paid to the implementation of civic training. Recently, in order to jointly improve teaching and training management by contacting the families of students, the school has specifically scheduled a Mother and Sister Association this afternoon, inviting the mothers and sisters of students in the lower grades and kindergartens to come to the school. The school teachers will have detailed individual conversations with each family. At the same time, achievements will be exhibited, and Mr. Zhang Yongchun, Mr. Shen Boying, and Mr. Jin Guisheng, who are rich in primary education knowledge and experience, will be invited to give speeches. The school also pays full attention to the connection between the school and the family at ordinary times. The parent-teacher conferences held on a regular basis are held separately for the middle and senior grades and the lower grades and kindergartens in order to be more factual. The meeting held for the lower grades and kindergartens this time is specifically called the Mother and Sister Association, because young students have the deepest relationship with their mothers and sisters in the family. Contacting mothers and sisters to improve the training of children is more practical. This is also an innovation in municipal schools.</p>

<h3>Fashang Ranks First with Four Wins in Four Games Parker Penalized Donghua's Unexpected Luck</h3>
<p>The West League Soccer A Group has been underway for more than a month. The Fashang Association, organized by famous players in Shanghai, has strong strength, with four wins in four games, ranking first, and the number of goals won is a rare record. However, Parker, the main forward of the team (that is, Parker of the West Catch team last year), has recently been penalized and suspended for two weeks. Therefore, the team will be greatly affected in tomorrow's game against Donghua, which is also Donghua's unexpected luck. Huosaisi's prestige is growing, and it is also the most promising contender for the championship. The Sanhua team is mediocre, and its position is still good, but Donghua's hope seems more optimistic. Tomorrow's game against Fashang will determine the future situation and is also the most important juncture for the team to advance. The current situation of each team is as follows:</p>

They are indeed strong enemies of our Chinese team. Although the Chinese team's participants this time are new, their average results are not inferior. Mr. Litte, the president of the association, has learned from the shortcomings of last year and is striving to correct them this year. In addition to hiring Chinese and foreign referees with real experience, he is paying more attention to the posture of the athletes. In order to avoid difficulties in refereeing, a referee meeting will be held at 8:00 am tomorrow (Sunday) at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Biande Road to discuss important matters. And when the groups and individuals participating in various countries will hold the final full-course practice at that time, they will also inspect the correct posture of race walking along the way, so that they can be judged immediately during the competition, without any doubt. The invitation has been issued, and it is hoped that the following nine Chinese referees Shi Youhui, Zhou Jiaqi, Le Xiurong, Cao Jinzhang, Zhang Zaochun, Zhou Quanyu, Yu Zichen, Shi Jinsheng, and Lu Yutian will attend on time.</p>
<p>In view of the imminent International Race Walking Competition, the Chinese Race Walking Association has specifically scheduled a full-course practice tomorrow morning (3rd) to select formal representatives. However, the route from Albert Road will be southward to Yiyuan, which is fifteen miles and two hundred and sixty-three yards long. Those who have already planned to participate must gather at the starting point at 7:30 am on that morning to wait for departure. Those who have registered with the association on behalf of them must also report at that time for joint practice.</p>
<h3>Public Exhibition Cup First Round Chinese Team Wins Big Over Westerners Last Night's Doubles Win Four to One Overall Chinese Team Ten Points Western Team Five Points</h3>
<p>Last night was the third day of the Third International Handball Public Exhibition Cup, with a total of five doubles groups. The Chinese team won four groups. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. As a result, the first round was defeated by the Westerners by a large score of ten to five, washing away the shame of the two previous games. In the fifth group, Gao Sun fought hard against the two Westerners He and Wei, winning two games in a row. In the fourth group, Cheng and Lu cooperated very well and defeated the two of Xisi. As a result, our Chinese team won a total of eight points, stabilizing the overall situation and contributing greatly. The battle between Sun Yan and Chaluo in the third group was even more fierce, because the two players of the Western team are both generals, and their strength is stronger than the other teams. Although Sun Yan tried his best to counterattack, he failed to defeat this strong team. In the second group, Hong and Huang lost the first game against Pike, but turned defeat into victory in the second game, showing a lot of skill. In the third game, they took advantage of the victory and went straight up, and finally defeated the strong enemy, making our Chinese team get nine points. In the last battle of the first group, Ma and Bu were experienced and strong, and finally lost to the invincible generals Zhu Kuan and Hong Jun with a score of three to one, and they were sincerely convinced.

<h3>Four Games in the Western Youth Basketball A Group Today Three Games in the B Group Starting at 2:00 pm Yesterday Also Sheng St. John</h3>
<p>The Also Basketball Team defeated John by 43 to 38 in the Western Youth Basketball League last night, which was unexpected. In the two B group games, there were great battles. The Zhongfu Middle School team and the Eagle team were both A group players and performed well. The Yuezhong team won by 39 to 23. In the Rowing team vs. Moore, the Rowing team won by 43 to 13. In another women's replay, the Rowing Green team defeated Delv with a large score of 48 to 7. The costumes of the two teams were beautiful. The Green team had average talents and their competition strength was very strong.</p>
<h3>Yuezhong Wins Over the Eagle Team (B2)</h3>
<p>The first time was the Yuezhong team against the Eagle team. The Yuezhong team is a strong team in the B group and the champion of the previous session. The Eagle team is a long-standing group. Under the exchange, both sides resisted tenaciously and the situation was fierce. Li Mingguang of Yuezhong took the lead, and the Eagle team was unwilling to fall behind. Zhang Ziquan made two shots and scored two points, creating a score of four to two. Then it became six to six. After entering, the momentum of Yuezhong suddenly increased, and Chen Huitang and Zhang Peixin made repeated achievements, taking a lead with fourteen to six. The Eagle team caught up urgently and actually took the lead with fifteen to fourteen. As the battle started again, the Eagle team's front was scattered and could not be recovered. The Yuezhong team took advantage of the opportunity and their momentum was unstoppable. Xu Wenkui made every shot and the score rose sharply. The Eagle team could only catch up. The result was thirty-nine to twenty-three, and the Yuezhong team won.</p>

<h3>Also Sheng Yuehan (A)</h3>
<p>This year, "Also" team emerged as a dark horse. Wang Huating returned with renewed vigor, and Zhang Wenyuan continued to serve, significantly enhancing the team's strength. Their performance against Yuehan yesterday was quite good. In addition, Yuehan's center, Cheng Jingxing, was injured, preventing him from playing, which greatly affected their lineup. Therefore, the game was evenly matched, with scores constantly fluctuating, making the situation very tense. At the beginning of the game, "Also" took the lead, with Guan and Tao, the two forwards, maneuvering skillfully on both sides, leading by nine to four. Yuehan tried to attack, relying on Zhou Xuexian's accurate shooting, surpassing "Also" with seventeen to eleven. "Also" did not relax, tying the score at eighteen to seventeen. At the end of the first half, Zhou Xuexian skillfully scored under the basket, giving Yuehan a slight lead of nineteen to eighteen. The competition was even fiercer in the second half. After several ties, Yuehan led twice, reaching thirty-two to twenty-seven and thirty-seven to thirty-one, thinking they had the upper hand. Unfortunately, center Ma Fangcui was fouled out after four fouls, disrupting their lineup. "Also" seized the opportunity, continued their efforts, and tied the score at thirty-eight. Then, Zhang Wenyuan and Zheng Zhifang scored successively. As time ran out, Zheng scored another point from a free throw. As a result, "Also" won with a score of forty-three to thirty-eight. Zhou Xuexian of Yuehan scored twenty-three points alone.</p>

<h3>Rowing Wins Moore (B2)</h3>
<p>The highlight was the rowing match against Moore. In the first ten minutes, they were evenly matched and very tense. Each side scored, maintaining a balanced score. However, later on, Rowing relied on their tall players to throw the ball into the basket, which was very easy. Moore suffered because their players were small and their formation was scattered. Only Song Qihou was a strong player, making it difficult to defend. In the first half, Rowing led with twenty-three to thirteen. In the second half, Rowing once led by more than twenty points. Moore actively counterattacked and caught up a lot, finally trailing by thirteen points. The score was thirty to forty-three.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments at the Shanghai Sports Association</h3>
<p>Mr. Knie, a Czech national and world-renowned sports figure with various honorary trophies, has been running the Knie Sports School in Shanghai for over ten years, diligently striving for improvement. It was once reorganized into the Huang Ke Gymnasium. It is now heard that, in order to expand its business, it has been reorganized into the Shanghai Sports Association by Mr. Spielmann, a director of the Banque Franco-Chinoise, and others. Everything inside has been reorganized with great effort, making it look brand new, a far cry from the past. On the evening of the 28th, a banquet was held at the Green Pearl Hall of the Great Eastern Hotel to entertain fellow journalists and invite them to visit. It is said that the organization of the association is very complete. In addition to Mr. Spielmann as a committee member and Mr. Yu Hongjun, secretary of the municipal government, joining as a sponsor and member, other committee members include Dr. O'Hara, lawyer Li Zhongdao, Guo Baoshu, Chen Gaocong, and Westerners such as Mr. Lai Haoshi. Mr. Knie remains as the sports director, providing instructions on everything. In addition to a great gym, massage room, and bathroom, there is also a very complete library. In short, the facilities are hard to find in Shanghai compared to other clubs. It is also said that the membership fee is very low, and significant results can be achieved after practicing for a certain period of time to strengthen the body, lose weight, and build muscle. The association's regulations are printed and available upon request. The association is located at No. 888 Weihaiwei Road, at the intersection of Seymour Road, telephone number 34607.</p>

<h3>Increasing Population</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>"There are three unfilial acts, the greatest of which is to have no descendants." "Nowadays, even though they are busy" "repairing the Confucius Temple" and "advocating the reading of classics," this kind of "anti-feminist" ancient teaching still does not produce much reproductive power and cannot match the popularity of "Birth Control Guidance" and "Practical Contraception." Unexpectedly, in this "century of birth control," countries are actually advocating for the effort to create little citizens. It's really interesting.</p>
<p>Italy, since the implementation of Fascism, has long been known for its "reproduction policy" in order to expand its national power. For example, the government provides annual subsidies for living expenses to those who have a certain number of children, and the government awards medals to those who have a certain number of children. News about such things is often recorded in newspapers. Recently, the new tricks have become more and more exciting. On the day of the marriage festival organized by the Fascist Party, more than two thousand couples in Rome held weddings. Each couple received a portrait of the Prime Minister, five hundred Italian lire, and sugared almonds. Moreover, the church also joined in the fun, willing to give the first child born to these two thousand newlywed couples a special honor that is not easily obtained. Oh, marrying a wife and having children has so many benefits, who wouldn't try their best? Only a fool wouldn't.</p>
<p>Italy's comrade, Germany, has also recently been working hard to promote the reproduction of the superior Germanic race. According to the statistics released by Dr. Bergdolt of the German Bureau of Statistics, if Germans do not work hard to produce children and maintain a sufficient population output rate, then, based on the population decline rate in the past seventy years, the population will fall to one-fortieth within five generations. This alarming theory has naturally given the Germans, who are known far and wide for their patriotism, a youthful shift and a powerful stimulant. If our Elder Brother Xi shouts from a high place again, why worry that every household will not hold a baby shower next year on this day?</p>
<p>Take Soviet Russia for example, without talking about any ethnicity, but it is said that in order to increase revolutionary power, they have also closed their doors and encouraged the people to work hard to create future warriors for the government. Except for those due to physiological reasons, abortion is a great crime. In addition to children born to formal couples, illegitimate children are also recognized by law. After all is said and done, this is nothing more than to increase the population. As for our eastern neighbor, they regard increasing the population as equally important as expanding military preparedness. No one can deny that.</p>
<p>Judging from the global trend, "having no descendants" is not only unfilial, but simply "disloyal." Therefore, I advise modern bachelors who are unwilling to be out of step with the times to quickly place marriage advertisements in newspapers and choose an auspicious day to get married. Married couples, quickly eat "seed elixirs" as meals, so as to keep trying again and again, working hard for the country.</p>
<h3>Happy</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>I have been bathing in that bathhouse for two or three years, and I'm used to it. Although my life has changed several times in the past two or three years, regardless of the distance, regardless of winter, summer, spring, or autumn, I go there nineteen times out of ten. I don't know what day it was, but a short and vigorous young man suddenly smiled and shamelessly called me "Happy"! So every time I went, they would all smile and call me "Oh! Happy!" or say, "Ah! Happy is here again!"</p>
<p>As for me? I found it very interesting. While dealing with them, I thought to myself, "Alas! Happy? What a beautiful synonym! But happy about what? Alone and adrift, living in this world, without the beautiful environment that people have, studying and seeking advanced knowledge, what is there to be happy about? And without the large amount of wealth that people have, able to use it as they please, appropriately, what is there to gain?"</p>
<p>However, they always call out. Not only when I arrive, but also when I leave, they still call out, "Oh! Happy is gone!"</p>
<p>The good thing about that bathhouse is that the towels and bath mats are always kept clean, and the service is extremely attentive. I'm used to it, often using their cleansing sponges unconditionally, and often chatting about everything. They have frank, straightforward, sincere, and consistent personalities and expressions. Other than what they deserve, they have no excessive demands. At first, I felt that their place was a smooth path in life. In my heart, I couldn't wait to bathe there every day, just to see them often and be happy! Later, I thought that these people were no different from wood and stone, only knowing themselves and not knowing others; only knowing how to serve society for their own food and clothing, and not knowing how to serve society for the broad masses. It was exactly as the Grand Historian Sima Qian said, "The common people are selected by themselves!" Because of this, I unconsciously felt a bit unhappy with them! But they are always better than those who obtain things without labor and are subject to legal sanctions, so I still like to associate with them!</p>
<p>Since I often go to that bathhouse, I can almost draw the interior layout: like that gold-painted price list, those pairs of bathing Western nude girls with beautiful curves, that declaration form for stepping on feet and bleeding, official seats, special seats, ordinary seats... most prominently, a couplet: "Double reflections in the waves, red leaves, the sun is bright / Phoenix perches on the pond, green algae, smoke hangs"</p>
<p>Happy goes, happy comes, coming and going, it's all happy. Today is truly happy, so I wrote this essay as a byproduct. Perhaps it is a scene in the city!</p>
<h3>Lament for Jiangwan</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Because I had to attend the unveiling ceremony of the Prime Minister's bronze statue, I got up early and took a car to the Chamber of Commerce. Walking across the Henan Road Bridge, the wind blowing in my face made me feel the early winter weather. On the bridge, during the morning rush hour, all those walking around were coolies and beggars. I only saw rickshaws and no cars. Compared to the cars and people of both genders mixed together at noon, they were clearly divided into two different social classes.</p>
<p>We were supposed to depart at eight o'clock, but we didn't set off until nine o'clock. Had I known this, why would I have gotten up early? Ah! This is the Chinese way! I'm really an idiot! A dozen or so trucks that usually carry goods were loaded with one or two thousand people: men, women, adults, and youths, all mixed together. Of course, I was one of them.</p>
<p>After passing the North Railway Station and leaving the bustling city, the convoy of trucks began to enter the Baoshan Road, where the yin wind was blowing and the ghostly atmosphere was heavy. The North Railway Station, which had been destroyed by artillery fire, had been repaired, making it impossible to see the traces of the war. However, the broken walls and rubble on Baoshan Road were still a sad sight. The bustling city of the past now only had a field of rubble. "Baoshan Road will not flourish again if the Commercial Press is not rebuilt." "That Oriental Library, the only cultural institution in China, was most regrettably destroyed by artillery fire!" "There are still remnants of yellow chrysanthemums here. It used to be a garden, but now only a desolate field remains!" As we passed the remains of the Commercial Press and the Oriental Library, we spoke in a disorderly manner, one sentence after another.</p>
<p>After the convoy passed Baoshan Road, we arrived at Jiangwan Road. The scenery here changed again. On the wasteland, scattered low houses stood on it without any order. Was this not also a battlefield! Burnt and bombed, the incomplete broken houses were often visible to you. This was indeed the method of clever people. If a house that had been bombed had not completely collapsed, cover it with boards and stack bricks into short walls. You didn't even have to pay rent. Many common people lived in these broken houses.</p>
<p>The wind blew in gusts. The national flag and the cold wind were in opposition, flapping in the breeze. Although the weather was very clear in the cold wind, I seemed to hear the ghosts of the patriots crying! This was their battlefield, their place of death. Our vehicles may have already run over their remains. It was because of our weakness that we could not avenge them, causing them to cry endlessly in the air!</p>
<h3>Disappointing</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The higher the voice for promoting domestic goods, the more treacherous merchants selling enemy goods increase. These disappointing traitors simply have no national concept in their minds.</p>
<p>Parents are happiest with their clever children, but the more they like these children, the less they live up to their parents' expectations when they grow up.</p>
<p>Inland stores keep saying that there is no double price, but the disappointing clerks at the counter still do business with double prices.</p>
<p>The more corrupt officials are, the more they want to put on a façade of integrity. If they collapse one day, they don't blame themselves for not living up to the country's expectations, but blame their subordinates for not living up to their own expectations.</p>
<p>A beautiful wife with romantic habits, no matter how well you, as her husband, treat her, when she encounters the pursuit of the opposite sex, she doesn't ask whether her husband wants to wear a green hat or not, she doesn't live up to her husband's expectations.</p>
<p>Friends with a bad reputation like to boast about themselves when talking to others, but their disappointing reputation has already given the other party a considerable understanding and a considerable conclusion.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Wanting to Leave Yet Unable to, Recalling Past Events in the Same Car / Half Crying and Half Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Decaying Autumn</p>
<p>Although Ji Zhi didn't say a word and only listened to others talking, after seeing the shadow of this building, his heart suddenly started to beat faster. Could it be that he would just take Gui Zhi home like this, section by section, and that would be the end of it? After taking her home, where would he go? Would he still wander around Haidian Street? Or would he sit in a milk tea shop for a while? Wandering around would be unconscious and afraid of running into acquaintances. But sitting in a milk tea shop? That would also be a joke. Entering the city from Dahongmen, taking the tram to Xizhimen, and then taking a long-distance bus from Xizhimen to Haidian, was it just to drink a bowl of sweet water in a milk tea shop? If none of that was possible, would he just take the original bus back? But the bus would have to drive to Xiangshan before driving back. There would be at least two or three hours of delay. Where could he settle himself for these two or three hours? With such hesitation in his heart, he couldn't help but show that sad look on his face. Gui Zhi thought to herself that it was her fault. He was kind enough to buy her a ticket and lead her onto the bus. From his expression, she knew that he only intended to return to Haidian to drop her off. Why was she giving him such a bad look? So she smiled at Ji Zhi and said, "When we get to Haidian, why don't you come up to our house for a seat?" Ji Zhi replied abruptly, "No need to go." He was originally just complaining. After saying it, he regretted it a bit. Why did he say "no need to go?" Gui Zhi only heard him say "no need to go." She had no idea that he was immediately regretting it in his heart. So she smiled and said, "Okay, see you another day." As she spoke, the bus had already stopped on Haidian Street. Gui Zhi followed the passengers and climbed down the bus. Ji Zhi jumped out of the bus and stood on the ground, patting the dust off his hands a few times. Gui Zhi, because he had taken her back from so far away, felt a little sorry for him just leaving like that. She stood to one side, watching him. (255)</p>
<h3>Climbing to the Forefront of the Times</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Meichao</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Plunge Below 700 Yuan as Financial Speculators Dump; US Governors Propose Using Silver Coins; Officials Deny Exchange Equalization Fund</h3>
<p>The gold market was depressed yesterday, and the situation suddenly weakened. Although there was no lack of potential for growth, it was difficult to maintain due to speculators selling aggressively. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose slightly, and London spot gold fell by four and a half pence. Exchange markets opened lower. US banks, commodities, exchanges, and stocks were all closed for business. The gross market opened relatively stable at 707.8 yuan, but general sentiment suddenly recalled the report that the annual meeting of US governors had resolved that the governors requested the president to restore the use of silver as currency, and many people echoed the call. There was also news that industrial and commercial leaders had made the same request. People's hearts suddenly became weak, and Yi Da Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Ri Chang, Qian Changxiang, Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, and others took the opportunity to sell, causing a sharp drop. The price once broke through the 700 yuan mark, reaching 698-699 yuan. After the opening, the banks had a very healthy appetite. The HSBC bank listed US exchange rates only up by 1.25, and the listed price was even lower. Large clients desperately bought in, and the price rose nearly 5 yuan from within 700 yuan. However, people's hearts were still tired. A Reuters report stated that the US Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, had stated that the United States also had an equalization fund similar to the British exchange equalization fund. This caused confusion in Washington officialdom. It was generally believed that it referred to the 50,000,000 yuan used by the Rehabilitation Administration to purchase newly mined gold. Officials also stated that this fund was completely different from the British exchange equalization fund. The market trended downward again. The after-market was still stable, but some companies forcefully squeezed the US exchange rate. Large clients such as Yuan Mao Yong sold aggressively again, and speculator Wu also bid, causing those covering their short positions to disappear silently. Gold prices finally broke through the 700 yuan mark. Reuters did not have any reports, but rumors were slightly negative. The spot price was 1070 yuan. The day's market situation will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The market opened at 700 yuan in the morning, which was up 6.2 yuan from the previous close. Commodities opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and US exchange at 33.875 yuan. Da Xing Yong (speculator Yang) sold first, and it fell to 699.1 yuan. Heng Yu, Ri Chang, Heng Xing, Yi Da Yong, Shun Li, Da De Cheng, and others all bought in at low prices. Zhengjin bought March US dollars at 6875, and the price rose by 2.3 yuan. Huixiang and Chun Yuan Yong sold aggressively at this time, and the situation stabilized. It was learned in advance that HSBC listed British prices at the same level and US prices up by 1.25, hovering around 2 yuan. However, because large clients were buying in aggressively, the exchange market tightened. Citibank bought January at 34 yuan. HSBC bought March US dollars at 5625, and April at 75. With the aggressive buying of Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Heng Xing, and Da De Cheng, the price rose to 4 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong continued to sell, and Shun Li, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others also came to sell off. People's hearts were still tired, and the price fell to 2 yuan. Sheng Da was still buying and still struggling. The March US dollar was 5625, and the company's intention to sell continued to be high. Ruikang Fuyu sold to 0.7 yuan. Zhengjin bought the March US dollar 625 and was still able to recover. When Da Xing Yong, Shen Kang, Wan Xing, and others sold again, the bank's doing business for February US dollars was already 375. The company sought to squeeze the March US dollar 625 but was unable to obtain it, so it was reduced to 0.2 yuan. Yi Da Yong, Ri Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, and others took advantage of the low price to buy again, hovering and rising to 1.9 yuan. The afternoon close was 701.3 yuan. Da De Cheng sold out, and commodities were taken at 0.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 700.3 yuan, and commodities opened at 0.8 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong vowed to sell again, but because the bank's appetite was quite good, Huabi and Zhengjin bought the March US dollar 625 and were still stable. Huabi and Datong bought the February US dollar 375, and then bought the same month 3125. Han Heng sold, but Heng Yu, Da Xing Yong, Hong Li, and others all entered and rose to 2.2 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong supplied, and the price fell by more than 1 yuan. Tian Feng Yong and Zhi Feng Yong even advanced to 2.4 yuan. After entering, Zhi Feng Yong suddenly entered and exited, and the situation in the field was vague, but there was no special change. Companies forcefully squeezed the US dollar. Later, because the March US dollar 6875 was also difficult to sell, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Zheng Chang, Tongyi, Yuan Sheng Yong, and others sold aggressively.</p>
<p>In addition, Huixiang also sold and speculator Wu's family worked hard to supply, and the price fell to 698.2 yuan. Datong bought the March US dollar 75 and recovered slightly, but people's hearts were already timid, and the price still fell to 8 yuan. The closing price was 698.2 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing entered the market, and Hengxing sold, but in the end, HSBC, Citibank, and Macali all bought the March US dollar 75 and were still stable, and finally the price rose to 9 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 704 yuan, and the lowest was 698 yuan, with a rise and fall of 6 yuan. As a result, the closing price was down 8 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The price was listed at 727 yuan because the HSBC bank's US exchange rate listed a long of 1.25, at 33 yuan. According to the closing price, it was pressed by about 29 yuan, which was 5 yuan more than the previous close. The book price for this month was 707 yuan, and for January it was 701 yuan. The water supplement in the morning was 707 yuan, and the water supplement in the afternoon was 704 yuan. The spot price fell to 1070 yuan because London spot gold continued to fall by four and a half pence. The situation in the field was vague. The Tianjin gang sold from 1070 yuan to 1075 yuan, which was done by companies doing business with each other.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Extremely Chaotic, Wild Fluctuations Difficult to Predict, Morning Transactions Revised to One Session, Market Prices Rise Sharply at the End of the Session, |Adjusting Progress and Retreat Based on the Changing Situation at Any Time|</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants' Exchange saw extremely rapid fluctuations in the market, with a trend toward chaos. The wild ups and downs were difficult to predict. Observing the situation, the question of whether the Fujian-Zhejiang war would break out was one factor, and the mediation of peace was another, with both proceeding concurrently. There was no definite news on whether the war had started. The so-called Guangdong request for Fujian to cancel the new organization and find another solution to the situation was tantamount to a conditional exchange. This type of mediation was too far from reality, and it was feared that there would be no progress, and the region would inevitably suffer from the ravages of war. The future situation seemed to become increasingly complex, and the market was caught in a dilemma, leading to chaotic prices. Due to the steep drop in the previous day's market, the exchange was even busier with the settlement and accounting of various brokers. The opening of the morning session was delayed until 10:15 am. It was generally expected that the disarmament bonds for the current month might have a slight rebound, but large players continued to sell, and the market was extremely chaotic. The opening price was 54 yuan, which fell to 51.8 yuan, and then rose again to 52.5 yuan. The sudden highs and lows, and the mutual pulling of bulls and bears, were truly dazzling. From the First National Bond to the Salt Tax Bonds, prices were stable, rising slightly by 2 to 4 jiao. Afterwards, after the short-term gold bond began to rise, it was suppressed again by large northern players. The long-term gold bond fell sharply by 1.5 yuan due to the heavy selling of No. 49 bonds. The market prices were contradictory and extremely chaotic. Trading was also very active, so only one session was held in the morning. The afternoon session was delayed until 4:30 pm, so only one session was held. At that time, it was rumored in the market that the Southwest was mediating peace, and short covering and large purchases caused market prices to rebound sharply, rising by about 1 to 2 yuan. The market was unusually volatile, and there were many changes in the future. Prices were adjusted based on the changing situation at any time. As a result, prices rose by about 1 yuan to as much as 2.4 yuan. The short-term gold bond was still down 2 jiao in the morning, and the near-term disarmament bonds were only up 3 or 4 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 30 million yuan.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Su Dongpo's Poetic Incarceration</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xia</p>
<p>Su Dongpo was accused of writing poetry with satire, offending the court. On the day the incident occurred, he was still in office in Huzhou. Su Zhe received a secret report in Nanjing and urgently sent someone to inform Shi, so when Jingwei arrived in Huzhou, Shi had already asked for leave to visit his ancestors. Song Kong Pingzhong (Yi Fu) wrote about the situation at this time in "Tan Yuan": "Chuan (Huangfu Chuan, the Jing envoy) entered the state office directly, wearing robes and holding a tablet, standing in the courtyard, with two platform soldiers guarding him, dressed in white clothes and blue scarves, looking around evilly, the people's hearts were surging and unpredictable." In the end, he wrote a concluding remark with emotion, "In a blink of an eye, he pulled a prefect, like driving dogs and chickens. This matter was witnessed by Wupo (the current Quanzhou)." It is possible to imagine what Dongpo endured at that time. Later, his books were also banned, which I have already discussed in a previous article. Yesterday, I read Song Zhu Bian's (Shaozhang) "Feng Yue Tang Poetry Talk" and obtained very good information. The text reads:</p>
<p>Dongpo's poems and essays were immediately spread and recited by people. Every time a piece reached Lord Ou's office, he was happy all day long, and it was similar before and after. One day, while discussing essays with Fei, Lord Ou sighed and said, "Remember my words, thirty years later, the people of the world will not talk about me anymore." During the Chongning Daguan era, the overseas poetry saint was popular, and later generations no longer spoke of Lord Ou. At that time, although the court had tried to ban them, the rewards increased to 800,000, the ban became more severe, and the transmission became more and more, often boasting of having many. Scholars and officials who could not recite Dongpo's poems felt their spirits were exhausted, and some people called them uninspired. (Volume 1)</p>
<p>The influence of Dongpo's essays at that time, and the severity of the investigation, can be seen from this. "The stricter the ban, the more the transmission," the situation in ancient and modern times is exactly the same. The damage to Dongpo's spirit during the poetic incarceration was not small. When he was arrested and escorted to Beijing, he saw the ferocity of the arresting officers and thought it was a great disaster, so when he arrived at Taihu Lake, on a night when the wind and waves were surging and the moon was as beautiful as a painting, he actually wanted to jump into the water and commit suicide, but he canceled the idea for fear of implicating Su Zhe after his death. After being imprisoned in Beijing, he still thought he would die, and he had secretly prepared "Qingjin Dan" for suicide, and wrote poems to say goodbye to Zhe, including lines such as "I will repay my debts before my hundred years are over, and ten mouths have no support and burden people more," "I will be brothers with you for generations, and make an unfinished bond in the human world." However, although Dongpo suffered great damage to his spirit at this time, after he was released from prison, he actually relapsed and continued to write his poems, and privately scolded himself, "Still not changing." In fact, this unchanging is inevitable, because the oppression of punishment is ultimately not as painful as the bondage of the spirit.</p>
<p>Writing this, I remembered that in Song Han Qinglao Nong He Da's "Chun Zhu Ji Wen," there was also a story about banning Dongpo's essays. Since I have talked about poetic incarceration to banned books, I will copy this story together for people who study the banning of books in ancient and modern times to refer to. The text reads:</p>
<p>During the Shaosheng era, the court demoted and blamed the Yuan Yu ministers and banned and destroyed the academic writings of the Yuan Yu era. Some said that Sima Wen Gong's Shinto stele was written by Su Shi and should be removed and destroyed. Therefore, the state issued a decree to patrol and destroy the stele building and break the stele. Zhang Shanren heard this and said: "There is no need to send it like this. Just let the Shanren take a jade book official and add the words 'Not Appropriate' to the stele's title." The title of the stele originally said, "Stele of Loyalty, Purity, and Pure Virtue."</p>
<h3>On Woodcuts</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>Some time ago, this column published two short articles discussing woodcuts, introducing several newly published woodcut picture books by Liangyou Bookstore. The popularity of woodcuts in China seems to be a recent phenomenon. It has been promoted by several bookstores (besides Liangyou, Modern also printed a thin volume of works by Chinese woodcut artists), the rise of woodcut research associations, and the publication in literary magazines, and supplements to translated collections, almost creating a small wave in Chinese literary circles.</p>
<p>Woodcut is an art that looks somewhat rigid, but it has a depth that other arts lack, like a clumsy person possessing rare advantages that a clever person does not have. It doesn't require any complicated colors, but relies solely on black and white to express moving and vivid images. Among many brother arts, it is the most lively, most open-minded, and strongest little brother. Its tools are just a few small knives, a piece of wood, and many sheets of paper for printing. It doesn't need to mix and stir colors directly on a palette like oil painting. However, although simple, carving requires profound artistic accomplishment and strong wrist strength. Of course, anyone who can draw a few strokes can scribble with a small knife, but I guarantee you won't carve anything good. Therefore, some people think that woodcut is a simple way to be popularized, but in reality, the production is still very sophisticated.</p>
<p>The main point of woodcut is strength, using brisk knife marks to carve vivid images. The method of woodcut is economy, reducing a large scene to a focal point, gathering a lot of "strength" to firmly gather in one place, the tighter it is compressed, the greater the "strength" it contains, and it is a top-notch work. Economy should be slightly exaggerated, for example, when carving a worker, his fists should be exaggerated to be very large -- of course, it should not be untrue -- larger than the head. As for metaphors like "chasing a person away like chasing a stray dog," it is also very important.</p>
<p>Because the main point is strength, woodcut is more suitable for carving figures, especially figures like laborers. Most of the woodcuts we see now are "rough people," which is the reason. The second is carving scenery, but the effectiveness of its characteristics is slightly reduced in scenery. From my personal point of view, I also feel that woodcut landscapes cannot surpass sketches or black and white paintings, although transplanting every grass and tree under the hard knives and pens is another kind of scene.</p>
<h3>Abundance and Disaster</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Liu Duo heard his companion’s cough, turned his head to take a look, and deliberately looked at the rice sacks in the cabin for a long time. For half an hour since the boat set sail, his eyes had often been on these rice sacks. This year's harvest really can't be considered bad. On average, each mu of land yielded two and a half shi. In the past few years, with such a harvest, he would really smile from ear to ear, row the boat to town to pay the rent, and when he came back, he could buy something. By the New Year, his daughter Xiao Mao and the others would have new cotton-padded jackets. Now that the harvest is good, Liu Duo is still worried every day. Isn't that so? The price of rice is much cheaper than in previous years. Even if each mu yields three shi, it is not as good as before. He sighed, and steering the rudder seemed to lack strength, looking far away at the place where the sky and the earth meet. His companion Qiu Tang coughed again, and he sighed and said:</p>
<p>"I calculated it over and over again, this year is the same as last year, another year of wasted effort!"</p>
<p>"You are much better than me. As for me, my own body is bad, and I hired someone to help. This year, I lost money again. By the New Year, I still have to borrow seventy or eighty yuan to pay Wang Daye's interest. This spring, I borrowed another hundred yuan from them, saying that the interest is one point three, and it's still looking at my acquaintance! Liu Duo, what are you worried about? As for me, if I think about it carefully, how can I live? I might as well hang myself. Do you know how much debt I have in total?…" Qiu Tang said, and coughed for a while.</p>
<p>Liu Duo spat hard, and the phlegm went backwards with a pile of garbage.</p>
<p>"These days are really strange. The price of rice has fallen so much, as if it were a time of peace. I heard the elders talk about the time when a bag of rice cost one yuan, and life was much better than now. Now, even though the price of rice has fallen, everyone says that life is hard."</p>
<p>A flock of birds was吵着 in the sky. Qiu Tang coughed again, without answering, just looking at the blue sky.</p>
<p>"The rent collectors are also shouting that they can't make ends meet, let alone us. But I don't understand who is living a good life!"</p>
<p>"I heard what Lao San said in the teahouse, the price of rice is cheap because too much foreign rice is imported. The harvest is not bad, why import so much foreign rice? It's really鬼! Liu Duo, are you talking about the rent collectors? They collect much less money, so naturally they feel苦了, they are used to good food and use. But they can get by as long as they use a little less, like us, that's…"</p>
<p>"Yesterday the price of rice was seven yuan and a half. If you weren't so impatient, I would have waited a day or two. Maybe it would have risen a little."</p>
<p>That one shook his head, making a face of disagreement, still coughing.</p>
<p>Both of them were silent, only the sound of the rudder splashing water, softly and rhythmically.</p>
<p>The boat entered the city river and slowed down. Many boats selling vegetables and firewood were blocking the way, which was very troublesome. Qiu Tang had no time to cough and was busy using the bamboo pole to hold back other people's boats, for fear of collisions. But his heart was beating non-stop, worrying about whether the price of rice would fall again today, and whether Wang Daye would be willing to give him a little more discount.</p>
<p>The large characters on the walls of several rice shops could already be seen vaguely. He felt like a prisoner about to be executed, and he had no idea in his mind. He looked back at Liu Duo, who was also frowning.</p>
<p>"Qiu Tang, why are you so slow?"</p>
<p>Seven or eight rice boats were parked in front of the rice shop, and two of them had not yet unloaded the rice.</p>
<p>"We set off late, what's wrong today?"</p>
<p>That one said angrily: "Seven yuan and two!"</p>
<p>"Seven yuan and two?" Qiu Tang and Liu Duo were both stunned.</p>
<p>"What's there to say? Pay the rent and go home and wait to starve to death!"</p>
<p>Liu Duo looked at Qiu Tang, put down the rudder, and sighed.</p>
<h3>Small Notes from a Traveler's Window</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Yu Xuanji's poem says: "It is easy to find priceless treasures, but hard to find a loving man"; Chen Meigong's poem says: "Ashamed to accept an insincere scholar, would rather associate with a sincere thief"; the former is spoken by someone who deeply understands the joys and sorrows of love, the latter is a cynical remark; in feudal society, it is rare to be able to talk so boldly.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhonglang's "Hengtang Lang" poem is romantic and elegant, and is most widely recited. But what I have seen are two different versions. One of them is:</p>
<p>Hengtang crossing, the gentleman comes from the west, the lady goes to the east. I am grateful for the gentleman's great generosity. My home is in Hongqiao, at the crossroads of the Zhumen. Recognize the Magnolia denudata, do not pass the willow tree.</p>
<p>This is what I knew several years ago, and it seems that Xie Wuliang's "General History of Chinese Literature" quoted this one. This year I bought Zhonglang's Complete Works, and the version contained therein is quite different from the previous version. The poem says:</p>
<p>Hengtang crossing, walking by the water, the gentleman comes from the west, the lady goes to the east. I am not a singer's family member, but a woman from a large family in Honglou. I accidentally spat on the gentleman while blowing flowers, I am grateful for the gentleman's great generosity. My home is in Hongqiao, at the crossroads of the Zhumen. Recognize the Magnolia denudata, do not pass the Yumberry tree.</p>
<p>Both poems have their advantages, and I don't know if the former was revised by Zhonglang.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (46)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He hoped that he might not see her before starting, and not plant on her cheeks the kiss that already disgusted him.</p>
<p>But she replied:</p>
<p>"Wait a bit, I am coming to open the door for you. But you must wait until I am back in bed before you come in."</p>
<p>He heard her bare feet upon the boards, then the shooting of the bolt. She called out:</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>He entered. She was sitting in bed, Roland beside her, his head wrapped in a handkerchief, turned to the wall, sound asleep. Nothing could wake him if someone did not shake him or pull him up. Those days that he went fishing, it was the sailor Babaguli who came at the appointed time and rang the bell to waken the servant girl, and then it was the servant girl who would drag her master from this profound sleep.</p>
<p>Pierre, as he went towards his mother, glancing at her, suddenly felt as if he had never possessed her.</p>
<p>She presented him with her cheeks, he kissed her lightly, then sat down on a low chair.</p>
<p>"Was it last night that you decided to go and loaf at Trouville?" she said. "Yes, it was last night that I decided."</p>
<p>"Are you coming back to dinner?"</p>
<p>"I do not know yet. At any rate, you need not wait for me."</p>
<p>He scrutinized her with a curiosity that was absolutely amazing. This was his mother, this woman! From childhood, from the time that his eyes were able to distinguish things, he had seen this entire face, this smile, this voice so familiar, so intimate, and all of them suddenly struck him as so estranged, so different from what he had hitherto seen and heard. He now knew that he had loved her before, but had never scrutinized her. This was still she, and he knew all the minutest details of her face; but it was the first time that he clearly saw these minute details. As he gazed carefully at this beloved head with a feeling of uneasiness, she appeared to him different from what she had been before, in an aspect which he had never discovered.</p>
<p>He got up to go, then suddenly was overcome by the strong desire to know that had been gnawing at his heart ever since the previous evening.</p>
<p>"By the way, I remember that when we lived in Paris there was a small portrait of Maréchale in the drawing-room, was there not?"</p>
<p>She hesitated for a second or two, or at least he thought that she hesitated, then she said:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where has that portrait gone to?"</p>
<p>In his mind she might have answered him even quicker.</p>
<p>"That portrait . . . wait a bit . . . I cannot remember exactly . . . it is in my writing-table, perhaps."</p>
<p>"Would you mind finding it for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I shall look for it by and by. What do you want it for?"</p>
<p>"Oh! it is not for myself. I think that it would be best to give it to Jeanne, and it would please her."</p>
<p>"Yes. You are right, that is a good idea. I shall look for it when I get up."</p>
