<h3>民族興亡之歧途</h3>
<p>— 忍</p>
<p>在内憂外患交相煎逼之下。我民族今日實已立於興亡之歧途。抑且在此歧途上。我民族絕不容再稍徘徊觀望。何去何從。急應以明快之態度。斷然立决。</p>
<p>所謂興亡之歧途者何。百年以還。我民族即長困於半殖民地之悲境。未克振拔。九一八以來。日帝國主義者更以强烈之暴力。任意侵略。置我於生死綫上。至於今日。情勢愈亟。岌岌不可終朝。故我民族當前之問題。厥爲如何抗禦暴日之侵略。如何維護我民族之生存。全國人民。都睽睽注目於此一問題。屏息忍氣以靜候解决。</p>
<p>我人今日。究將如何以解决此一迫在目前之問題乎。或者猶有人認爲熱河旣已陷落。日人攫取整個東北之目的。亦已達到。今後庶幾可以停止其侵略之步武。則吾人亦可暫劃長城爲界。閉門而守。休養生息。徐作後圖。此種心理。實爲大錯。姑無論日帝國主義者之慾望。决不以東北之取得而滿足。而同時九一八以還。國人無日不企望政府能實行嚴正之表示。設使今日於東北失地。竟不作恢復之打算。大好河山。就此長任其變易顔色。則不僅無以樹立政府之威信。而予反對者以口實。抑且全國人民。在此强烈刺激之下。尤極易或由失望而消沉。或由憤激而騷動。即使外患稍弭。而此種或由消沉或由騷動而發生之現象。亦足以釀成民族前途無窮之隠憂。况乎我民族如此懦弱無能。長此隠忍。非特暴日更將志驕氣盈。不置我於目中。即世界列强各國亦將蔑視我民族。我更無以立足於國際之林。此死亡之途也。</p>
<p>反於是途者又將如何乎。則我當認清當前國際政治經濟之情勢。認清暴日國内捉襟見肘之狀况。認清我國家今日所處之地位。同時更認清我民族革命戰爭之重大意義。以最大之决心。拚死與日帝國主義者作長期之奮鬥。務期收回失地。驅逐日帝國主義者之武裝於我疆域之外。傳有云·「多難可以興邦」。又云·「無敵國外患者國恒亡」。我民族尙未喪失維護民族生存之精神。則此當前之國難。即可認爲復興我民族之動力。則土耳其之復興。此其時也。再造我國家。重奠我民族之新基。即在於是。此則新生之路也。</p>
<p>事至急矣。我民族今日立於此興亡之歧途上。已無復徘徊觀望之暇時矣。其將大踏步以走上復興之生路乎。抑自甘沉没於滅亡之死途乎。吾國上下當以明快之態度。當機而立决。十字街頭。三叉路口。民族之生死存亡在是。其將何去何從。</p>

<h3>孔祥熙昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>談赴北方前線慰勞經過</p>
<p>並謂本人願任抗日工作</p>
<p>蔣委員長一二日中來滬</p>
<p>考察歐美實業專使孔祥熙氏、由歐返國後、即晋京向中央報告考察經過、旋北赴平津、至喜峯口、慰勞宋哲元等部抗日作戰將士、復至保定、謁晤蔣軍事委員會長、日前南返、昨晨八時、由京乘夜車返滬、其夫人宋藹齡女士亦同來、據孔氏昨晨語本報記者、謂蔣委員長約一二日中來滬、今日因在京另有要公、恐無暇抽身至各方請任蔣爲海陸空軍總司令、孔氏之意、以爲在今日現狀之下、爲統一軍權便利指揮起見、實有設置之必要云云、兹分紀其談話如下、</p>
<h3>喜峯口視察</h3>
<p>孔氏首謂、今次乘北上謁蔣委員長之便、特親赴喜峯口、我軍前線視察、慰勞宋哲元等部抗日將士、迭與宋哲元龐炳勛等各將領晤談、我軍防禦工事異常堅固、士氣尤極奮發、至糧械方面、中央盡量接濟、無虞缺乏、現在喜峯口之軍事、成相持狀態、宋哲元等部奮勇殺敵、厥功至偉、我方犧牲亦極重、視察喜峯口後、本擬轉至古北口一帶陣線慰勞、以時間不及、遂匆匆返平、</p>
<h3>日緩和空氣</h3>
<p>孔氏繼稱、日方於每次軍事以後、必散放種種謠言、圖緩和空氣、按之實際、完全爲一種誘惑作用、其得寸進尺之野心、始終未變、他日必又恢復獰猙面目、再謀大舉之侵略、蓋毫無疑義、中央對華北軍事、已有嚴密之準備、誓與敵週旋到底、外間妥協直接交涉等謠傳、絕對無稽、在今日而言對日妥協、非喪心病狂、即毫無心肝者也、</p>
<h3>蔣委長來滬</h3>
<p>孔氏復謂、返京後、迭晤蔣軍委長、聞渠一二日中將來滬一行、或轉道赴浙、然後再北上坐鎭、惟今日在京另有要公、恐無暇來此、乘車或乘飛機亦未决定、至張學良在滬、聞近患小恙、本人擬即往晤、</p>

<h3>任抗日工作</h3>
<p>孔氏又謂、今次本人在歐美考察所得、現正在整理、他日當全部公佈、記者當叩以今後是否仍擔任振興工商業之工作、答稱、今日國勢阽危、千鈞一髮、高談振興實業、緩不濟急、本人極願擔任抗日工作、盡國民一份子救國之責任、</p>
<h3>迭克推多制</h3>
<p>最後談及迭克推多制問題、記者詢以德之希特勒、意之墨索利尼、均以迭克推多制、使國家中興、君意今日之中國、適宜於迭克推多制否、孔謂、中國今日不在制度問題、而在人的問題、迭克推多制固佳、試問何人能實行獨裁、各方意見多端、政令不一、一事之興、議論風生、均在文字上做工夫、而見諸事實者極少、甚願國人團結努力、抵抗外侮、否則國亡無日、更有何制度之可言、孔氏言下、不勝感慨云、</p>

<h3>國人鑒於東北往事不可漠視西北新省政情與回漢衝突</h3>
<p>新聲社云、近日西北發生變亂之說、甚囂塵上、然皆外電傳述、眞相難悉、頃有湘籍西北交通界人、向新聲社記者談及新省政情與亂事之起因、以及外人對該地之垂涎情形頗詳、兹分誌於下、</p>
<p>政情概况　新省自楊增新被刺後、繼之者爲金樹仁、金係甘肅狄道縣人、就任以來、大都蕭規曹隨、施政方針、一承楊之舊貫、故新省一切毫無進步可言、如交通建設敎育等、均較内地其他各省爲落後、獨財政一項、則較其他各省爲豐裕、該地風俗人情、甚爲鄙塞、及主政者又多不知啟迪、益以楊增新長新省時所遺愚民政策、尤爲該省人民不開化之主因、階級之不平等、一如民國紀元前時代、例如人民與官吏等之稱呼、則仍以「大老爺」代之、人民之謁見官吏、亦須磕頭禮拜、非經赦免、不敢抬頭發言、此外縣長道尹等每一官吏到任、必須宣示刑法如何之嚴峻、俾人民聞而懔懼、至其尤甚者、縣長道尹之調任時、竟有携其在任所施慘刑之照片、於到任時公懸示衆、借以威嚇人民者、此外人民生計方面、亦極簡單、經濟狀况、則頗豐富、故全省各地、無行乞者、</p>
<p>回漢隔閡　西北回漢兩族人民、素相枘鑿、加以施政者之未能設法調和其感情、以致衝突時起、星星之火、即成燎原、陜西一帶、回漢兩族之自相殘殺者、慘聞時見、且彼此互相報復、幾無已時、最近數年中、新省亦時有衝突發生、然均不如陜甘之慘、該省自金主政後、回族勢力益衰、當局於已往之新省回變、爲防阻針、壓迫愈嚴、殊不知此種施政方針、則逾予回漢兩族以更甚之仇視、蓋在回人方面、固可忍受於一時、然終必生反響、故壓抑一族之方法殊非根本解决之道、且金之狄爲甘道縣人、該縣人民、在甘肅所受當地回民之壓迫極甚、因之狄道人之至新省者、多圖有以報復之舉、同時因金主席之同鄕觀念頗深、以致狄道人之旅新者、每有越軌行爲、即同族之漢人等、亦受其欺罔、因之一般人對金之感情、頗爲不良、</p>
<p>變亂起因　上列所述、即此次事變之遠因、至其近因、則由於哈密縣當局之欲行取消該地三回敎賈薩克（即三之稱呼）、查哈密三賈薩克、係遜清所封、迄今未廢、其權位較其他各地之賈薩克爲大、故一般回民多崇拜之、民國以來、其權位遂與該地之縣長分立、而田漕賦稅等、多歸於賈薩克、待至去年春、哈密縣長爲安插到哈之金主席狄道同鄕及應付此項經濟問題計、遂下令將該賈薩克取銷、因而引起當地回民之反對、遂起騷動、初時該地回民、尙致電金主席請願、奈電報爲縣當局所檢查、回民乃疑當局不准其請、遂羣起反抗、於是縣當局亦電迪化告急、旋金主席派大軍至哈、回民已表示歉悔、并有多數願自首者、奈當局不予接受、於是回民復起頑抗、亂學發作後、金之部險、屢爲回民所敗挫、雖雙方人數、衆寡懸殊、然回人素性極强悍、且持有土人所製之毒質木性槍彈、中者即無生望、且製造簡易、接濟迅速、以致亂事延幾一年、始告平息、然大多數之强悍回民、多逃亡於山野、旋分散於四週、而潛其勢力焉、今春金主席之報告、即此一段經過、</p>
<p>漸致蔓延　自哈密方面之亂事、告一叚落後、殘餘多竄至新省四週、故各小鎭市、均時有因小故而引起紛擾之事、大城市亦有不穏之勢、雖最近之詳情、因離新已久、尙無從斷其確否、然以情勢視之、當亦難免之事、</p>
<p>亟應注意　此次事變、實不可忽視、應從速設法調解、以免爲外人所乘、並派大軍前往彈壓、恐非根本解决之道、且亦非爲新省當局所可接受、蓋該省抦政人員、排外（非指外人言）思想頗深、深恐謀奪其權位、故民國十八年中央所派之黨務指導專員褚民誼王增善等、均爲該地當局所拒、此非私人方面之欲赴西北者、亦非經當局預先允准不可、故調解一層、實亦無從着手、然亦不得因此而忘却之也、</p>
<p>外人垂涎　該省物産之豐富、爲國人所共知、然我國不自知開發、以致頗引起外人之垂涎、最近除英俄互相暗中角逐外、日人亦頗思插足其間、然在事實觀之、尤以俄人勢力爲大、蓋俄國除於暗中設法慫恿回民外、並在疆邊作公開之宣傳、塔什干一帶、近有俄人僱用新人所辦之回文報紙三數家之多、其中之最有力者厥爲「脫離」報、英文名（Autulus）專爲向國人宣傳者、而所用文字、亦非常淺顯、意在欲使回人易於明瞭、故一般無知回人、頗受其愚、甚有因出入之不得自由、與受壓迫、竟脫離中國而入俄籍者同時蘇俄自五年計劃中所完成之土西鐡路後、新邊頗受其威脅、如當局再不設法改善、恐新疆將亦非我有、至英人勢力較小、然亦特出拉攏該省蒙人以與俄敵、日人勢力、雖現尙未得插足、然亦躍躍欲試、聞日方自前年犬養内閣所闢之回敎研究會、最近亦頗有驚人之勢力出現、據回人「脫離」報所載之照片及文字觀之、日方並於去歲派日本之新回敎信徒、經新疆前往麥加考察、日人並視此爲插足西北之嚆矢、其危急之狀、有使吾人不容絲毫忽視者、國人其已注意及之乎、</p>
<h3>德國抵制猶太人不致影響上海</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、自德國國家社會黨發起抵制猶太人運動後、本埠德人與猶太人領袖、今日（三十）皆向記者保證、雙方之爭、純屬德國内部問題、不致影響上海、本埠德僑間、當不致發生抵制猶太人之宣傳、而僑滬猶太人、則旣未考慮報復手段、亦不欲作任何公衆運動、宣傳抗議云、</p>
<h3>日使有吉回國前對華外交意見足見日人心理之一斑可爲我國政府之參考</h3>
<p>大通社云、駐華日使有吉明返國協議、當未離滬前、曾擬定此後對華外交意見書、共分四章、洋洋千言、大通社記者、昨向日外交界方面、覓得該項意見書、擇要譯録如下、</p>
<p>放棄直接交涉　（理由）以前我國（有吉自稱）「下倣此」之所以力持中日直接交涉者、原爲避免國聯無端干涉、及阻止中國政府向國聯提出公判、今我國旣已退出國聯、此種强毅態度、實足使國聯方面、受一重大打擊、卽世界各國目光、亦爲之轉移不少、且此後對華外交、國聯旣無權予以干涉、即使中國政府、欲將滿洲問題、提交國聯解决、亦必因我國已退出國聯、而不成絲毫問題、由此觀之、則中日直接交涉一節、已不適用於現在環境、設我國仍力持前議、不但於無形中增高中國之國際地位、且更顯示我外交手段之軟弱、故此後我國政府、對華交涉、應另闢新途徑、</p>
<p>鞏固東北基礎　（理由）刻下「滿洲國、其基礎雖已日見擴展、但一切行政、尙未能步上軌道、我國當局、仍應處處予以實力之協助、而尤以鞏固國基及領導行政爲最重要、目下世界各國之所以不予承認「滿洲國」者、亦因「滿洲國」基礎未及鞏固、及一切政治行政未入正軌故耳、現我應亟抓住此項缺點、着實做去、務使「滿洲國」國基日見鞏固政治日趨清明、使各國無所藉口、則承認不過時間問題耳、</p>
<p>對華暫抱冷靜　　（理由）中國國民政府、自東北問題發生後、對内對外、均感異常苦悶、各省軍志領袖、現雖因對外緊張、而暫告中止内戰、但暗潮仍日在澎漲、不過均格於中國人民之評議、而不敢自爲戎首耳、如我對華軍事行動、正宜因熱河已得、而暫告一段落、祗守而不攻、而藉以緩和中國各省軍事領袖對我之態度、則内部之爭鬥、亦必又見勃發其時我再乘機而進、則目下一切不能解决之問題、亦必迎刄而解、如此、不但我忠勇義士、可以免去許多犧牲、即對於世界各國、亦覺易於應付、</p>
<p>運用政治手腕　（理由）總觀以上各端、嗣後對華外交、不可專憑武力、而亟應運用政治手腕、已屬毫無疑義、現中國當局、亦頗多主張、以和平態度、來解决中日爭端者、第以我國之軍事行動、未能中止、且又鑒於國人之不諒、以致終不敢貿然向我提出此項主張、如我國政府、能將武力外交、一變而爲政治外交者、則前途勝利、當可操左券、否則、中國當局、將以「抗日」二字、號召人民、其與我背城借一、則我國亦恐毫無把握、奪得勝利以歸也云云、</p>
<p>有吉明此項對華外交意見書、曾經駐滬日軍政當局一致之通過、故該項意見書之結論下、並有多數日重要人員之簽字、據日總領署方面消息、日外務省當局、已與有吉作一度之會商、大約可」望採納云、</p>
<h3>太古南昌輪船在牛莊被盜刧西籍四船員被綁傷多人貨物無損</h3>
<p>英商太古公司商輪南昌號、於本月二十五日上午十時、由滬啓程、載貨不多、且並無貴重貨物、駛往牛莊、於二十九日上午十二時、停泊牛莊口外、候引水員時、爲海盜搶刦、西籍船員被綁、傷多名、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>停泊遇盜　太古公司雜班（俗名野鷄班）商輪南昌號、載重二千五百噸、船主爲英人魯濱遜、買辦潮州人林炎松、於本月二十五日上午十時、滿載麵粉雜貨、由滬駛往牛莊、及至二十九日上午十二時、抵牛莊口外停泊、待候引水員上輪引進港内、突發現海盜十四人、駕民船三隻、各持槍械、首向南昌輪放槍示威、旋即登輪、口操北音、</p>
<p>放槍綁人　海盜登輪後、即監視老大及無線電員、禁止行動、時西籍船員二等機師白魯·三等機師裴爾期·曁低級船員約翰森·哈格萊夫·等四人、正在大餐間閒談、倉猝之間、登輪海盜、誤爲旅客、以手槍壓迫、意欲綁去、爲其他船員瞥見、設法抵抗、海盜即放槍、當塲傷華籍船員多人、海盜即綁架四西籍船員、束縛手足、登停泊在旁民船、向西北駛去</p>
<p>發警求援　船主魯濱遜、得報後、即奔回寢室、取槍械以圖抵抗、及趕至大餐間、海盜已綁四人登民船遠去、即發無線電、報告牛莊僞國水巡隊、及日海軍求援、同時並將受傷華籍船員救護、幸受傷均甚輕微、無性命之虞、檢查客貨、絲毫未遭損失、</p>
<p>僞艦搜捕　牛莊僞滿洲國軍警得無線電報告後、即派巡艦駛往援救、俟趕到時、盜已遠去、奈因盜船吃水甚淺、向淺水而遁、巡船無法尾追、駐泊在牛莊江面英國砲艦得警後、即駛往加入搜捕海盜民船、但終未獲、</p>
<p>設法營救　上海太古公司得報後、知西籍船員四名被綁、並槍傷華籍船員多名、客貨幸未損失、當即電瀋陽英領事嚴緝海盜、至於瀋陽英副領事克拉克聞警後、即赴牛莊與僞滿洲國軍警磋商營救辦法、</p>

<p>亞洲文會酌加補助　該會近經函陳努力籌欵之情形、捐助之數頗見加多、惟本年經常費、仍不敷約二千兩之譜、衆委員以該會之籌欵方法似已竭盡、其不數之數、由本局特别予以補助、亦尚可行、因即建議、在本年内、酌增該會補助費約二千兩之數、但聲明係特别性貿來年不以爲例、</p>
<p>學意檢騐暫行緩辦　上次董事會議、曾經討論學校内之醫學的檢騐問題、嗣由衛生處長向財務委員會報告、此事開辦之第一年、約需費四萬兩、並稱、此舉爲現代市政上之通常職務、且在中國各市區、亦日見通行、工部局未便落後云、某委員云、局中今已用其入欵約十分之二於敎育費、如檢騐之事實行、則以後每年需欵將日益加多、財務處、</p>
<p>長亦云、本年之預算、雖已設法使之平衡、但一應重大新計劃、無論如何有益、皆處極端審愼着手、故此舉似可緩到下年再議、嗣經詳加討論後、議定、如果經濟充裕、則此舉亟應辦理、惟在本年中、則暫不撥欵、</p>
<p>旅店照費酌量規定　財務處提出、各項捐稅執照費徵收額、應行變更之處、内中關於華式旅店、有人建議、可於照房間數目計算照費之外、另加照床位計算Ｎ方法、財務處長云、對此議已詳加考慮、認僞太過、渠意、學請將此項按季徵收之照費、最高額由二百兩提至三百兩、（按最低額向係三兩）而於估計之手續、免予規定、以便捐務處得詳爲斟酌其輕重、而使擔負得以均平、某委員云、此項最高額、上年甫由八十兩加至二百兩、今此議是又欲增一半、又收捐方法有兩種標準、恐使較爲貧苦之旅店蒙其不利、財務處長云、捐務人員、對於分等、向極仔細、即令最高額加高、自當極端注意、不致苛徵云、旋經討論、公决、將此項最高執照費額、定爲每季二百五十兩、</p>
<p>娛樂處所增捐問題　關於娛樂處所增加市政經費之負擔一層、據財務處長稱、此議係應醫務調查委員會之建議而生、惟關於其原則及實行方法、均尚須詳加考慮、旋由總辦聲稱、此項徵費、應規定一最高額、以便提請納稅人之允准、嗣由委員會公决、請財務處長會同總辦、將此項增費問題、應如何提議之方式、切實酌定、除以上之意見外、所有提出之一九三三年度各項捐稅執照費等之徵收表、均由委員會認可、</p>
<p>財務等處行政經費　財務處（包括捐務處）情報處·法律部·總裁辦公處·總辦辦公處·各項預算、亦均經委員會通過、其中財務之預算中、有行政費一萬兩、係爲敎育事業支出者、循照最近將敎育經費明白開列之主旨、此欵撥入敎育預算項下、又捐務處爲增進收捐之效率起見、需添用有估價等項知識之專家、擬撥欵約五千兩、以便物色延用、至總辦處之經費、因辦理關於工業管理及工廠檢查事件、增用專家一員、故經費亦較增云、</p>

<h3>日船相繼停航受排日影響</h3>
<p>▲二十四日大阪朝日新聞云、自中國各地排日以來、日本輪船之運輸營業、日呈衰退、凡聯絡中國中部北部間之船舶、如大連汽船會社、以三月五日上海開出之天津丸、與川崎汽船會社、以三月十日天津開出之絲崎丸、均爲最後之航路、今後該方航路、必爲英商太古公司·英商怡和洋行·與中國招商局三大輪船公司所獨占、要之、因排日以致日船一再停航、阻止營業、不勝遺憾、惟中國内地、情形比較不同、譬如山東、因與地方官之交涉、表面上高倡排日、實際上未受如何影響、仍若平時買賣交易、故一時日本貨之輸入、頗爲繁盛、惟邇來平津方面之交易、比較滯澁耳、</p>
<p>▲二十二日東京朝日新聞云、駐華商務參事官横竹平太郎、此次爲接洽要務返國、三十一日乘上海丸、在長崎進口、發表中國貿易情形如下、目下抵制日貨、依然不停、然實用商品、不拘其如何彈壓、其地位已逐漸開拓、凡不經理日本商品之外國人、現在對日貨亦需要漸增、最近在法租界開設規模偉大之日本百貨店二所、變更包裝式樣牌子、販銷市面成績奇好、至於中國人之排日感情、究非一朝一夕可以改變、故吾人對於此點、應特别努力云云、</p>

<h3>中國農民問題的出路</h3>
<p>丨平湖徐士璋君來信丨</p>
<p>因爲我被自己的思想激怒着，恕我很急切地提出下面這段疑問，尙希不吝指敎；去年我們鄕間總算是豐收的一年了，每畝産米二石以上，但農民貧困如故；倘設法改良其耕種方法，而且假定已增至每畝三石之産量，此時農村經濟可算完全解决了嗎？如果答案是否定的，那末是否另有使農村經濟衰落的原因呢？換句話說，不論環境怎樣，祇須努力增加生産量，農村經濟便會不息地向上發展嗎？至此我人更假定，農民的貧乏，實緣於多方面的壓迫；於是農民勢必以擺脫現在的困苦環境而另謀别的出路，似亦情理之常。然而此種異端邪說，（或稱洋八股）在新進的智識階級看來，似乎已不值一談，所以就成了匪徒的專利品，我是一個平民，焉敢把這種比炸藥危險過百倍的思想輕於置信，但我被上述的疑問困惱着，確已無法擺脫，最後我把自己的意思說得更明顯些；如果增加生産量不是救濟農村破産的絕對良藥（因爲美國農工業的生産過剩是我們大家所知道的實例）那麽就請先生在增加生産以外，替我國三萬萬八千萬農民謀一條光明的出路，這是我唯一的希望。</p>
<p>答：農村破産，農民貧乏，「實緣於多方面的壓迫」，中國農村經濟的病象，已被足下一語道破。我們知道，中國農民的貧乏，是由於帝國主義者的商品，深深地侵入農村；中國的資本主義已漸漸地侵入農村；我們又知道，中國的農民是被高利貸所壓迫，被苛捐雜稅所吸敲，加之機器耕田，在江浙一帶採行已多，小農破産，兼併益烈，農民概爲商品而生産，丨總而言之，鄕村爲城市所剥削，中國爲帝國主義者所剥削。現在的農民最急切的問題，首先就是土地問題，此問題已不止是「耕者有其田」一口號所能解决的了！這是事實，恐怕没人能夠否認。把握住了當前的事實，并把握住了當前的關係，則當前農村問題究應如何解决，足下應亦不難尋獲一光明之途徑了。</p>

<h3>生命線</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>日本人新發明的侵略名詞呌做生命線，旣經聲稱滿洲是他的生命線，現又聲稱國聯委任代管的太平洋諸島是日本的海上生命線了。</p>
<p>他們對於陸上的生命線很容易的在不抵抗將軍手中攫奪去了。對於海上的生命線，正想實行他們「租田當做自産」的計畫；但，諸島是德國的舊物，近來德人對於諸島的運命，已引起了非常熱烈的注意，看來，這海上生命線不見得似陸上生命線這般容易到手吧。</p>
<p>生命線是人人皆有的，爲什麽日人的生命線不在本身而在他人身上呢？試問從前勢力不曾臌脹到滿洲，以及太平洋諸島代管權不曾取得到手，他們都是没有生命的麽？試問没有生命的國家，會得傳延到今日麽？</p>
<p>生命線跟着他們的慾望而擴大，有了海陸的生命線，當然也要有空中的生命線了；僅把太平洋諸島以及遼吉黑熱四省當做海陸生命線，還是非常客氣的最小限度。依着他們疙瘩肚裏的念頭，或者要說五大洋都是他們的海上生命線，五大洲都是他們的陸上生命線，地球周圍的天空，都是他們的空中生命線，那麽生命線集中於一國，日人當可表示滿意的了。</p>
<p>但，侵略者的慾望是没有滿足的，只怕他們的生命線又要推廣到旁的星球裏面去呢。</p>
<h3>廢紙舊鐡</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>丨涕淚灰塵不可出賣丨</p>
<p>早幾天，報上登着日人收買中國各機關字紙簏裏的廢紙，這幾天，報上又登着日人收買各處的廢鐡，失敬失敬，日人倒是挑舊貨担的同志。</p>
<p>有人說，日人是精靈鬼，「廢物利用」是看家本領。收買中國各機關的廢紙，目的是想從廢紙堆中找出一二頁「收復失地政策」，或是「抗日全盤計畫」，或是「外交一貫政策」來，暴露一下中國侵略野心的鐡證。收買各處的廢鐡，是製造小鍋般的軍帽，或是製造槍砲，發給每一個日人，監視每一個滿洲國人，或是預備替本莊繁，土肥原，武藤信義等一般滿洲國開國功臣鑄鐡像。這些東西，在我們看來，果然是廢物，但是日人收了去，倒很像無意中開到了一個礦。就以溥儀那小子而論，打從龍庭上挫了下來，不他早已成爲一件半文都不值的廢物了麽？豈知給挑舊貨担的土肥原老大哥挑到了長春，裝塑了一番，居然成了威靈顯赫的大執政。日本人廢物利用的本領，豈非高出於三十三天之外矣乎哉耶？</p>
<p>我說，這麽說來，在下準不會窮死。俗語說，「窮雖窮，家裏還有三担銅」。家裏藏着三担銅，本來不能算窮，就因無人收買，於是窮了。現在好了，就是舊鐡，廢紙，都可以賣錢，那麽，痰盂罐裏的鼻涕眼淚，或許也有喪心病狂的漢奸，偷偷摸摸地來高價收買，去供給善於利用廢物的敵人，製造「流淚彈」，門角裏的灰塵和垃圾，也可給敵人製造「烟幕彈」，莫說那三担銅了。</p>
<p>但是，餓死事小，失節事大，下走雖窮，决不以「涕淚」「灰塵」濟敵，這是可以設得誓的。</p>
<h3>滿洲族的民國大員</h3>
<p>日本製造僞國，說是民族自决；李頓報告書及國聯大會報告書中，對這點都有明白的駁斥說明僞國成立，是由於日本軍隊與官吏之在塲，非出於當地人民自願。國聯大會報告書更說明東三省人民三千萬，滿族祗居極少數，而此種少數的滿族，又已同化於漢，東三省各地之發展，與關内各省無異，民族自决之說，根本誣妄，國聯以爲即此已駁倒日本；其實，還有可駁的事實在着呢！很奇怪的，這一件可使日本無從置辯，而在中華民國却是很光榮的事，不但國聯没有注意到，便是我國人也非常忽略，從來很少有人談起過！這便是關外尙有一個眞正滿洲人而始終忠於民國的誠允，其地位與熙洽同；九一八禍變發生後，處境亦同；而思想人格和行事，則絕對相反，至今尙爲民國保持一部分土地。日本說是滿洲民族自决，事實上那僅有一千萬的滿族已不在滿洲，在滿洲的眞是有限；而在有限之中，倒有一個滿洲人的民國大員如誠允者，始終樹者擁護民國反對日本並反對僞國的鮮明旗幟，日本人該怎樣的解釋呢？（翼）</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三回　終負解鈴心登門鐙錯　暗憐丫角願推食分羹</p>
<p>當他走出大門來的時候，臉上是帶着很重的怒色，以爲回　　得家去，必定要將聽差嚴重的質問一聲，不料一出大門，怒色没有了，嚇了一跳，臉上立刻變成蒼白。原來哥哥厚之正背了兩手站在自己的大門口，向這裏望着呢。自己由楊家大門裏出來，哥哥是看得清清楚楚的了，這還有什麽法子可以抵賴，只得低了頭，走到自己門口，側身而進。當他走出桂枝的屋子之時，桂枝看了他那一番不好意思的情形，心裏就想着，無論那聽差說錯了什麽話，積之是不知道的，自己和積之發脾氣，未免無理取閙。而且看到積之無精打彩的走了出去，一定是聽了言語，心有所不甘，於是也就悄悄的跟着在後面走出來，意思是想和積之說兩句客氣話，平一平他的氣。不料他不跟出來，却也没甚關係。他一跟出來之後，恰好讓厚之看到，他二人是形影相隨，這豈不是他二人要好的一個鐡證？桂枝站在門口，伸頭向甘家大門口看了一看，他伸頭向那邊看時，厚之也睜了雙眼，向這邊看看。厚之是有氣的，桂枝看到楊家的大門，也不能無氣，因之那邊氣憤憤的看了來，這邊也是氣憤憤的看了去，四目相射，都各有氣。桂枝看到，立刻將身子向後一縮，還聽到厚之重聲在那裏道；這是我親眼得見的了，你還有什麽話說？積之答覆的聲音很低，聽不到說的什麽。繼續着又聽得厚之喝道；你胡說。今天一早，我就知道你到楊家去過的。現在你又在那裏出來，一天跑兩三趟，你究竟爲的什麽？我倒要請問一問。這幾句話說過之後，便聽得聲音越說越遠，大概就是他二人都進屋子去了。桂枝聽到這裏，心裏有幾分明白，分明是厚之嫌兄弟不該和窮姑娘作朋友，若是再和他往來，他兄弟們非失和不可，自己怪積之那是怪錯了，不過這樣的遭作官的人看不起，實在可恥，從此以後，就不必和甘二爺見面了。（二八）</p>
<h3>拍板底下的消息</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨倒也是時局好壞的晴雨表丨</p>
<p>諸位到過交易所裏做輸贏的；或是去觀光的。總看見塲内圍聚着不少的人，伸直了手；提高着喉嚨，有的喊買進；有的喊賣出。等到兩方成交已定，台上的拍板先生，拍的一下，兩方生死已判，再也不能反悔的了。我一方面暗暗佩服拍板的權威；一方面更研究他們買賣的焦點在那裏？一探聽之下，纔知道小小的商業場，倒也是時局的晴雨表。</p>
<p>前幾天美國的銀行倒閉，這消息一傳來，交易所中的金價大跌而特跌。買進的人兩眼發白；賣出的人却彈冠相慶了。你想在這拍板底下，雖定了賣買兩方的生死；却更有關全世界金融的好壞，眞不要小覷它咧！</p>
<p>這兩天又不好了，我們的什麽公債票，又在跌價了。它們的跌，我們不去做買賣，本來没有什麽關係。不過這一跌恐怕要跌出毛病來，大半是天津情形不穏所致。想不到拍板底下，又會判出時局的安危來。</p>
<p>「月暈而風，隨潤而雨。」鄕下的天文家，都拿它來做標準，倒也百無一爽。都市中有天文台測騐氣候；普通的人家，也有一具晴雨表，那是告機械的力量，更是準確了。不過時局的好和壞，是隨便甚麽機械測騐不出的。現在我却發明了一件東西，便是這交易所中的拍板</p>
<h3>縫窮婦</h3>
<p>— 島生</p>
<p>天天，路角碎磚堆上蹲着一個老婦人，縐皮臉上戴着老光眼鏡，穿着藍布襖，青布圍裙下露出一對小脚。身旁有一隻竹籃，籃裏藏着碎布，襪底和紗線，有時還放着一些乾糧。伊整日在眼花手抖之下替人家縫襪底，補衣裳，添鈕子，忙個不了，博一點蠅頭之利。伊便是一個爲一般人所瞧不起的縫窮婦。</p>
<p>縫窮婦的年紀大，工作忙，賺錢少，……照理伊該悲哀自己的命運，然而伊永遠笑嘻嘻地表示滿意的樣兒，從没有歎過氣，或者吁過一聲。</p>
<p>伊的兒子拉黄包車，媳婦做工，孫兒揀煤拾舊貨，各人都有一樁微事幹，各人也都有一點收入。收入少，支出也少，生活雖比不上富家那樣舒適，但也不虞肚子餓，一家子融融洩洩，誰也没有他們那樣的知足，快樂。</p>
<p>伊的兒子有時拖着車子，恰巧經過那處路角，會很響亮的喚幾聲「媽」，這時，伊會暫停工作，慈祥的目光直透出老光眼鏡，去迎送兒子。有時孫兒掮着竹筐走到伊跟前，向伊要一個銅子買糖吃，或者搜伊布籃裏藏着的乾糧，伊總是順從小孩的要求，不加責備，永遠笑着</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>京市的一個角落</h3>
<p>— 施興基</p>
<p>丨夫子廟内部的速寫丨</p>
<p>「老虎啊，老虎，…非洲的大蟒蛇！」向來來去去的人們嘶呌着，一面用手指着那布篷上，圖形，龐然的一雙老虎和一條蟒蛇，幾幾乎比人體要大到一倍。好在花錢不多，十多個銅元能廣一廣眼界，這倒也值得，於是乎有一個個的人們進去，同時也有一個個的人們出來，進去的興冲冲，出來的却懊惱地不住的搖頭，「一雙山貓和一條水蛇！」從觀光過的口中吐出。但是站在門前的人仍是「老虎啊，老虎，…非洲的大蟒蛇！」不斷地嘶呌着，而且仍有一個個的人們進去。</p>
<p>「戲法戲法眞正妙，宛似鬼神和仙道。」不錯，手段的確靈敏，但不該妄自吹牛，假如要說是眞有其事的話，祇要這樣質問一番：「戲法要是眞的，那麽坐在家裏享福好了。要吃，憑空去取山珍海味；要穿，…何煩在此乞憐？」看他們有何理可駁？在這個角落裏，却頗能荷一般人們的稱贊和驚服！</p>
<p>嗓子旣破啞，鼓聲又不合節拍，怪難堪的。可是在低級社會裏，似乎算是一種無上的享樂，一種萎枯裏獲到甘露！往往說到緊凑的時候，便賣起關子來了，突然地停頓，把每個聽衆的袋中的錢，盡力搜流出來。</p>
<p>表面擦得亮光光的，看去好似簇嶄新的，不論皮鞋，杯碗，眼鏡，自來水筆，……表面洗刷得乾乾凈凈，没有破綻，像衣服，鞋帽，……其實，到這裏來出售的貨品，都是陳舊的了！或是不眞實的。索起價來，倒貴似好貨，聰敏的掉頭就走，要等他們喚回來的時候，纔得議定價錢。起碼須要一個半折，纔不致上當。</p>
<p>賣百草糕的，走方郎中，據他們說：「以寳貴的藥賤價賣了。這是一方面修陰德的（？）。」刷白牙粉，雪恥肥皂，化學補磁補鐡膠，…他們能夠當塲實騐效能，但是要保長久，却不可能的。</p>
<p>牛肉，大餅，…氣味瀰漫在空間，各個人的鼻孔是不同的，有的感到的是香噴噴，有的感到的是臭烘烘的，香也好，臭也好，總有許多人去吃它的，不必厭棄。</p>
<p>這裏很少有紳士階級者的光臨，計有工人，兵士，科員，流氓，掱手，…熙熙攘攘。每逢星期日又能增多些。</p>
<p>「看這卦上，今年你老兄的流年還不錯；可惜，…」什麽峩嵋山人，也是仙，張鐡角，不怕窮，…之類，相面的，批命的，拆字的。</p>
<p>「鐺鐺鐺…」清磬的鈴聲偶然間傳播到耳根，無疑地這裏有個學校，從嘻嘻哈哈的歡笑裏，又便知道這裏的學校是一個小樂園了，大門是緊閉着，大約恐防小兒童要和環境同流合污。</p>
<p>烽火連天，血肉迸射在巍峩的古長城邊沿在這裏亦能由報販的手裏，看見驚人的字眼，印像在眼廉，不識字的可從報販口中的「打日本鬼子！」裏，知道一二。</p>
<p>在這個角落的四周，有高大富麗的茶坊酒肆，游戲塲，電影院，……享樂的華貴比這裏高幾倍，代價的金錢亦是要比這裏高幾倍。</p>
<p>虚僞，浮薄，……在這裏有整個的表現，亦是低級社會的一個冩眞館。</p>

<h3>逃出死亡線</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>幾個知識分子聚在一起，便常常相顧咨嗟歎息着：「無聊！無聊！」人生眞是這樣無聊嗎？現在眞是世紀末了嗎？</p>
<p>近二十年來，知識分子之個人生義意識，享樂頽廢傾向，越來越濃厚；其色彩如落霞晚照，刺激性極强，但黄昏近了，不久就會死亡的。這種意識，究竟由何而來？她的母胎即是知識分子所留戀的「小家庭」。近代青年男女，從大家庭中逃出，從宗法社會中逃出；但他們並不走向社會，做社會的人；他們躱避在小家庭中，和社會隔離，漸漸成爲孤立的個人。</p>
<p>人，必是社會的人，生活方有意義，生存方有價值。變成爲孤立的個人，那就是原始獸性抬頭的機會。一座一上一下的衖堂房子，客堂，灶披，前樓，亭子間，住了四五家人家；事實上並不是四五家，乃是四五國，彼此不相問問，不相往來，那「守望相助，疾病相扶持」的老話，早没人理會了。每家帶着鄕土的習慣，用冷嘲一，「憎恨」的態度相處，不斷在打雞駡狗中過活。從衖堂社會中成長的青年，没有社會，没有家庭，只有惟一的個人。所謂上海小市民，就是這一種純個人主義的青年。其精神所注，以大旅館生活表演得最出色，輝煌高大的建築，裝飾得十分華麗，而小市民在那裏面，打牌，吃大烟，呌姑娘，一室之中，胡天胡帝，誰也管不了誰，於是變態性欲，變態物欲，錯綜以起；强姦，雜交，投機，冒險，如打嗎啡針然，非有刺激性的不能鼓舞意欲，變態乃成爲常態了！</p>
<p>知識分子所呌喊的「無聊」，即是强度享樂後的「空虚」；如狂醉初醒，手足是麻木的，舌頭是苦澀的，眼睛是繚亂的，還能對於什麽發生興趣呢？這是隣於墟墓的死亡線，我們若不願埋葬在那邊，即須鼓起勇氣從死亡綫逃出！換句話說：我們即須步出小家庭，（並非回向大家庭），到社會去，做一個堂堂的「社會的人」！</p>
<p>個人，力量是脆弱的，是無能爲力的，容易陷於悲觀的；一成爲社會的人，力量便堅强了！什麽都可樂觀了！現在正是青年向上發展的時期，人生並不「無聊」，何必咨嗟歎息呢！</p>
<h3>救國捐</h3>
<p>— 血箴</p>
<p>是在一次「救國」集會中，有人在主席台上慷慨激昻地說：「國難臨頭，太平洋中的風波排山倒海般的來了，同學們，要猛醒」！脚一頓，手隨着一揮，頗有「聲淚俱下」之概。接着，那救國主張便是：「諸位現在能節食造健身房很好，如今再請你們在點心錢上省點來作救國捐，三餐已夠……」</p>
<p>「先生，香烟也可以不吸的」。不知是誰的聲音，很低，然而很清晰，每隻耳朶都聽得到。</p>
<p>「唔，是的，濟南慘案時我戒過三星期，的確，三星期！但……」</p>
<p>「熱度和香烟頭的火星一樣的微細罷」？</p>
<p>顯然地，台上的人是很不高興。</p>
<p>「但，事情不是絕對的，所以，我不是呌你們不吃零食，只是說少吃些，正如我……兄弟吸烟……」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不澈底些呢！」</p>
<p>台上人惱了，揮一揮手，呌散會。</p>
<p>姑娘們一窠蜂似的湧出禮堂，有的撅着嘴，有的在笑。</p>
<p>「什麽救國捐，幾個銅子兒夠買飛機嗎？而且，誰知道買飛機幹嗎」？</p>
<p>「管他呢？過一天，算一天！『廳令』不是呌我們安心讀書嗎？現在又說要「救國」，究竟該怎樣」？</p>
<p>沉默，片時的沉默……</p>
<p>「我要託英給我買捲軟片，春天，該多留點年輕的影子。」喬移轉談話的方向，笑，看着天，天上的白雲冉冉地飛，喬的靈魂兒也隨着白雲在冉冉地飛。</p>
<p>「小程今天准有快信，這傢伙，自認是勇猛的戰士，還學着「奮鬥」呌我美麗的小鳥呢。」嬌俏的娜也獨自個兒計算着，似乎在矜誇着那被人稱爲Queen的榮耀。</p>
<p>桌子上滿散着時代畫報，電影雜誌，有時裝，有媚笑，有舞女的腿，有運動員的雄姿……還有幾張没有肯聆一聆眼的義勇軍苦戰的攝影。</p>
<p>「敏，這條腿多滑潤，像你的！」輕聲的笑。</p>
<p>「你的腿比她還迷人！」敏擠着眼笑。</p>
<p>「聽說電影皇帝和風流寡婦結婚了，不公平，她怎麽配得上他！咱們得去信駡」！精神好得像打了嗎啡，找信紙。</p>
<p>「得啦，琴，珍，早去信了，呌電影皇帝離了她。」</p>
<p>笑，大家在笑。</p>
<p>台上的那一位先生又來了，脹紅着臉，又背著「救國」「讀書」的經典，有一句是：「抽鴉片也可以談救國。」</p>
<p>「對呀，跳舞也可以救國！」</p>
<p>「閙閙戀愛，打扮打扮，也可以救國！」</p>
<p>「救國之方多矣哉！」</p>
<p>響應着，大家響應着，立時姑娘們的心覺得很輕鬆。</p>
<h3>舞場中</h3>
<p>— 秋翁</p>
<p>在某一個夜裏，因爲友人的邀請，我第一次去拜訪某一個新闢的舞塲。</p>
<p>「舞場」，這一令人神往的名詞，雖說我已習見習聞，但實地拜訪舞塲，這次却還是「破題兒第一遭」。所以，當我的脚剛剛踏進舞塲的外門的時候，即感到那綴在樹枝上和假山上的紅緑電燈，都在擠眉弄眼向我這驀生的顧客發出輕蔑的嘲笑。</p>
<p>坐定了，僕歐送上我們所呌的西點來，於是我開始搬移驚奇的兩眼，環視四週的一切。</p>
<p>紅的，緑的，紫的，以至各種顔色的電炬，交換地閃爍着在舞塲的週圍，音樂手們奏着狂歡之曲，婉轉，香艶，如情人之細語，又如少男少女們的的青春之狂歌，舞塲，便這樣地被裝成有聲有色的「人間之丨樂園」。</p>
<p>舞孃們圍坐在舞塲的四週，白的粉，紅的胭脂，細長的眉，鬈曲的髮，妖媚的眼，長旗袍下依稀掩映着的顫動的肉，那便是舞孃，像「天仙」一般，在等待着虔誠的膜拜，又像「商品」一般，在等待着中意的顧客。從一羣不自然的微笑裏，我恍惚聽到了淚珠暗落的聲音。</p>
<p>舞客呢，自然都是華貴的西服，潔白的領，光亮的皮靯，光亮的頭髮，每一個人的眼裏都放射出貪婪的光，在搜尋着中意的俘虜，在搜尋着肥白的羔羊。</p>
<p>樂聲響了，電炬變換神秘而誘惑的顔色，於是一對，兩對，……開始摟抱着，緊緊地，在光滑的地板上，隨着婉轉的樂聲，那樣地糾纏，像妖精打架，肉在顫動，心在跳躍，舞客們在笑，得意地，舞孃們也在笑，得意地，「俘虜」，誰是俘虜？都是丨丨丨這世界是狹小的，只有肉，金錢，此外便是騙人的笑。</p>
<p>樂聲戞然而止，摟抱着的又悠然地散開。</p>
<p>這樣我便第一次認識了舞塲，丨一所人間之樂園，一所黑暗之地獄！</p>
<h3>戲劇家必讀</h3>
<p>— 銘彛</p>
<p>坐在醉翁椅上大談其農民戲劇的熊佛西（見大美晚報某期），據說是在美國專門研究戲劇的，那麽這位戲劇專家的言論，自然是值得我們注意的，特别是戲劇界同人。</p>
<p>因此，在南京出版的××月刋底戲劇專號上熊先生的「誡條與信念」，在下惟恐大衆不能「周知」，特借「自由談」的篇幅，摘要録出，以廣流傳。每條略附註解，聊助讀者的理解：</p>
<p>不寫十個人物以上的戲。不寫兩個女性以上的戲。（註：熊氏信徒聽說只有藝院戲系四五人，其中女的聽說只有顧某一個。）</p>
<p>不寫凶殺與結婚。（註：熊氏的「醉了」却只拿着刀追人，大概還不曾兇殺。）</p>
<p>不讓姨太太與妓女在我的劇本裏發現。（註：熊氏是上流紳士，妓女與姨太太太賤了，不應該在高貴的戲劇裏出現，有損紳士的尊嚴。）</p>
<p>不參加游藝會。（註：游藝會有下流的肉腿歌舞，有損戲劇的眞價值。）</p>
<p>不與女演員戀愛。（註：如果與女演員戀愛，難免有人喫醋，或許戀愛不成，戲也不能演了。）</p>
<p>在後台工作時間不大便，不小解。</p>
<p>（註：萬一肚子瀉了的時候，也得裝在褲襠裏帶回家去。）</p>
<p>在後台不咳嗽，發生了天大的事故，也不改變鎭靜的神色。（註：就是日本人殺到頭上的時候，也要鎭靜，任他宰殺，這大概不是美國來的主義，而是國粹。）</p>
<p>在下只抄出這幾條，當作「戲劇家必讀」。我同時還希望熊先生不斷的給我們許多誡條，使劇運前途，得以發揚光大！</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 嚴天平</p>
<p>耀星笑着問，</p>
<p>「不要問誰說的，只問你是不是有這個意思。」</p>
<p>「笑話！誰有空閒管這些閒事！要趕他的是他的同鄕老秦。」</p>
<p>「秦雪松？」</p>
<p>耀星笑着點了點頭。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「老秦說，他有哲學的理由，要趕朱渭道。不許他在學校裏當敎授。」</p>
<p>「什麽哲學的理由？」</p>
<p>「因爲朱渭道不單是四川人，而且是老秦的小同鄕，M縣人。大概是嫉妬吧。嫉妬是心理的作用，所以說是哲學的理由。…」</p>
<p>「你的意思怎樣？」</p>
<p>「老實說，朱渭道也不算是一位好敎員啊。」</p>
<p>海泉聽見後，不便再向他爲朱渭道說情了。他此刻忽然看見李一香向着那個像吃鴉片烟的青年在縱談文藝理論。</p>
<p>「老陳還是儘在那兒提倡什麽Realism，什麽New　Realismo我們要給人家駡的！此刻時代，還說什麽Realism！…笑話！」</p>
<p>李一香先生的雙手仍然歛在袖襖裏，看他的神氣是不滿意於陳華民的文藝理論，說了後，頻頻地搖頭。</p>
<p>「現在的，的，的，時代，我，我，們應當提倡構，構，構，成派的藝術,Tectonio的藝術。老周，對，對，對不對？」</p>
<p>「………………………………」</p>
<p>那個像吃鴉片烟般的青年只是笑着點了點首。</p>
<p>又等了一會，陳華民也帶着兩個青年來了，一共有十一個人了。陳華民一到便立即宣告開會。</p>
<p>原來唐耀星剛才說的好消息是他們新組織了一個出版部，大家的作品可由自己出版了，同時每千字還可以預支一元至二元的廉價的版稅。</p>
<p>最後，陳華民還報告了一個使海泉聽見發生驚恐的消息。即是Ｓ社總部决定了於×日舉行向帝國主義的示威運動。大家要踴躍地參加遊行。不參加的便是反革命。</p>
<p>海泉聽見，就聯想到那晚上打黄包車夫的兇惡的日本巡捕來了。</p>
<p>「這，這，這，不用說的。當，當，當，然要參加的。……」</p>
<p>李一香首先贊成了陳華民的提議。海泉想李一香那樣一個文弱書生，尙且這樣地熱心參加遊行運動，自己是一個青年，豈可落這位老前輩之後。</p>
<p>開完了會，大家隨意吃茶點了。彼此可以自由談論了。他們决定了辦一種社會科學刋物和一種文藝刋物。談論到文藝理論，陳華民的新現實主義和李一香的構成派藝術又交戰了。海泉便偷偷地問了一下唐耀星構成派的藝術是如何的藝術。</p>

<p>花三月鄭標花、在去年十月十一日上塲、價爲三十二兩四錢、此時减值美棉收成增加、市盤落至三十一兩外、後因國産棉花年成不豐、各路來源凋敝、歲暮金價大漲、發現八百三十兩外之新高峯、以致外棉採算銀盤殊昂、白洛去棉來滬銀價須三十六七兩、由此引起一部份多頭活動、同時某經紀商代表某外商購進三·四萬擔、市盤愈趨愈緊、最高曾見三十四兩五·六錢、嗣至年頭、印棉因内地到貨擁旺、消費减少、白洛去棉價由一百羅比外直跌至一百七十六七羅比、合算銀價來滬、祇三十三兩外、比去年歲暮價跌去三兩外、於是本棉勢難支持、市盤傾向下游步步向低、延至本月份中、紗銷大滯、廠方對於高價原料絕其審愼、美新總統羅斯福就職後、對於維持棉作一案、目前仍無相當的辦法、由此多頭大爲失望、故最低價曾見三十兩零七錢半、比二月份價高三錢、結果殘餘一萬一千七百擔、交割價爲三十一兩五錢、實行交割祇五百擔、貨品皆係天津粗棉、其餘爲自行交割、兹將收交兩方經紀商及號數包額分列如下、</p>

<h3>紗花實銷不振</h3>

<h3>糧食　河下米市定局</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源二十餘號、城鄕店胃稍有、包胃雖續動辦、然已呆木、市况遂見定局、蘇同帮及南港青角等米價僅略高三五分而已、杜洋尖及陰變元亦帶定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源二十七八號、白粳去路晨刻乏交、午後稍化、市形小去近角、薄粳早稻到消兩和、形稍帶軟、羊杜尖到貨續有、零拆略交、市形平疲、客尖埠尖乏交、機客尖稍有做開、價形平定、白元消呆價定、</p>
<h3>閩帮辦湘米二千餘包</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、突然轉活、因到貨不旺、而閩帮忽又購辦大批湖南米、市面回好、湖南機紅米回好數分、其他各貨一律轉定、閩帮共計辦去二千六百餘包、本街亦去機早百餘包、今明如閩帮繼續暢辦、市面卽有步砌之可能、全日售開湖南機紅米一千六百包、價八元四角至八元零五分、又砶紅一百零二包、價七元六角半、又砶油五十九包、價八元、又砶靖四百包、價六元六角至六元二角、又機靖二百二十包、價七元六角、江西機早一百五十七包、價六元四角、高機晚二百四十包、價八元六角半至八元六角、江西機早爲本街辦去、其餘統係閩帮辦裝云、</p>
<h3>麵粉俏而復疲</h3>
<p>丨受洋麥抛價低廉之打擊丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午初平繼俏之象、以洋麥報價互有一角上落、人心自然轉平、本月份初開較小二釐半、後因北帮如天津·山東·營口等均有抽買、市氣遂見緊俏、較初價即續好一分外、遠期亦因客帮辦進、人心亦隨帶高、當時之兵船老車現貨均喊一兩七錢三分半、本月份標準故見緊迫、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣又總平疲、以現洋麥之兜價、愈覺鬆廉、六十三磅阿根廳麥喊三兩一錢九分、紐絲綸麥喊三兩二錢六分、聞廠家曾定成一船、同時廠家又有抛出、市氣隨之復疲、照洋麥之步廉不已、前途仍不免受其衝激也、結果本月份較前日好五釐、四月份好二釐半、五月份不動、六月份小五釐、七月份小二釐半、八月份不動云、</p>
<h3>麥市午後始轉活絡</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份又趨沉寂、四月份至七月份一無見交、祇八月份開出市稍變動、迨至下午開盤、市面已見活絡、交易亦轉暢惟市况則出入無幾、近期祇行家尙有套頭、但一部已上棧、未肯廉脫、遠期則洋麥愈定愈廉、與目下之標準已相差不多、因此人心平平、照此情形、標麥前途、終少案觀也、結果本月份較前日好一分、八月份小一分、餘無出入云、</p>
<h3>豆餅有大宗成交淮市暫居平定</h3>
<p>昨市豆餅走銷見活、客餅紛紛抵埠、貨主爭先貶價、行家乘機買進、計微開大連光邊餅三千片、價仍原盤、浦口源康餅一千五百片、價一兩二錢三分、無錫恒德五六天交貨三牌利字餅三千八百片、價一兩二錢五分、四牌禄字餅二千四百片、價照三牌減一錢、本廠餅、由行家收進三千片、市砌分譜、客銷温台汕頭南帮、略有少數問津、均爲行家回出之貨、油情人心平定、因來源陸續雖可接、而各路走化漸形開展之故、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約現絲一致報跌</h3>

<h3>十年來蘇聯的航空事業</h3>
<p>現時蘇聯航空交通網、分佈極廣、全國航空交通線、總計長四五○○○公里以上、三個龐大的航空管理處、縱横全國、由西境直達太平洋、由列寗格勒直達阿富汗、北至北冰洋、南迄土耳其界和波斯界、聯邦最遼遠的和最落後的區域如牙庫地亞和沙哈林、現時均有經常的空中交通、與全國文化中心聯系起來、在加賽克斯坦和中亞細亞奇熱的沙漠區裏、數世紀以來都是以駱駝爲唯一的交通工具的、現在則飛機之聲振人耳鼓、成千的旅行者在幾個鐘頭内、可以走從前需要幾個月的路程、</p>
<p>新航空線之探險者、不辭勞苦、日與北冰洋的極冷氣壓奮鬥、遍走北冰洋沿岸全線、同時另一勇敢的探險隊、則自勒拿河口出發、沿北冰洋海岸直達葉尼塞河而至台麥爾半島和雅馬利半島、第三隊自阿爾强格斯克出發、繞烏拉爾山坡前進、與第二隊相遇、</p>
<p>一九二三年航空運輸、計載客二二九人、郵件一·八噸、載貨一○○公斤、一九三二年則總計載客二七二二五人、郵件四二九·七噸、載貨四四七噸、這是十年來蘇聯空運發展的道路、蘇聯在航空交通事業上、現時已與歐洲最大的國家並駕齊驅了、</p>
<p>但蘇聯民用航空隊的工作、不僅限於發展空運而已、蘇聯最大的成績之一丨丨蘇聯歐亞兩洲沿海區域間經常的航運之成功丨丨完完是飛機帮助之力、在黑海和裏海、曾用飛機帮助偵查、弋獵海狗、約在一九二一年與一九二三年之間、許多國家開始對於利用飛機帮助農業和森林業的嘗試、但在資本主義國家中、這種消滅農業和森林業害蟲的「航空化學」方法、遇到不能免除的困難、土地分屬於許多個别的佔有者、利用飛機、未免不合算、</p>
<p>蘇聯則恰恰相反、她有其他國家所没有的可能性、她可以在農業上應用飛機、一九二五年蘇聯曾第一次用飛機把消滅害蟲的毒粉散佈在一○○○公畝的地上、七年後、一九三二年用飛機散佈毒粉的地面約百萬公畝、其中四三○○○○公畝是消滅田鼠及其他害蟲的、五八○○○○公畝是消滅帶霍亂的飛蟲的、僅就此種數字而言、已足以證明土地國有在改良農業上的優點了、關於在農業上應用飛機方面、蘇聯實遠駕乎一切國家（美國在内）之上、</p>
<p>此外、飛機攝影、在國民經濟上同樣演很大的作用、飛機攝影、給鄕土地理以便利、并代替了其他的鄕土地理的方法、烏瞰圖的意義在研究蘇聯廣大的面積上、在測量面積上、在發見新水力和新富藏上都非常重大、攝製烏瞰圖的嘗試、始於一九二五年、所攝入的面積計九○○平方公里、至去年、這個數字便增加百倍以上、即一○八○○○平方公里、</p>
<p>凡此都是民用航空隊之有規則的、普通的日常工作、民用航空隊除了這些日常工作之外、差不多每年都有特殊的任務、過去他所完成的最著名的任務之一、是蘇聯朱希洛夫斯基號和巴布希京號兩個飛機救護意大利號飛機的工作、一九三二年春、幾十個漁夫立在氷塊上、飄出拍加爾海、不能轉回、首先發現這些漁工并引救生船前往救他們的、是加盧協夫號飛機、斯列蒲聶夫號飛機大膽地飛往尋覔死於北氷洋的美國飛行家衣爾遜及其機師之屍首、她找着他們的屍首、并把屍首送到亞拉斯加去、最後次指出用飛機把報紙鉛字送到全國各都市去的事實、航空史是與航工業史有極密切的關係的、蘇聯民用航空隊、在他成立的初期、就是用以發展國内航空事業的基礎、也未曾有、蘇聯最初期的一道航空綫、用的是外國飛機和外國摩托、至今還在有些地方應用着、</p>
<p>一直到不久以前、纔開始按照蘇聯工程師之設計、完全用蘇聯的原料造成自己的飛機、烏克蘭工程師加里寗所築的飛機、和有名的建築師杜波列夫的飛機都是其中的皎皎者、去年約自一九三一年下半年以來、這種飛機開始排擠蘇聯航運中外國的飛機、一九三二年是蘇聯飛機、特别是上述的飛機在蘇聯航空線奪得領導地位的一年、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府曾建立很大的航空研究院、院中製有更新的、更完備的、更時式的飛機樣式數十種、現在已經製好了有三十個坐位的旅行機一種、這種旅行機表現出蘇聯飛機設計之優勝、蘇聯在這方面、又已擠上第一等國家之一列了、</p>
<p>哈爾科夫航空研究院之年青大學生曾製造出一種客機、其中有人行道、技術上有很多的改良、這飛機在第一次試飛時、便以每小時二九○公里的速度飛行了、列寗格勒民用航空隊研究院之大學生用「被木」建築一種特别結搆的飛機、使飛機重量異常减輕、這飛機在第一次飛行時、自列寗格勒到莫斯科只需要三個半小時、現在剛從學校裏畢業出來的飛機建築師雅司夫列夫和沙夫洛夫建造了幾種小飛機式樣和一種可以在水上和地面上停舶的飛機、在民用航空隊研究院中、大膽地開始試築一種與其他國家飛機工業中所用的普通原則完全不同的飛機、他們運用不生銹的鋼來代替鋁、利用電氣鍜接方法來代替帽釘、按照這種方法造成一種完全新式的飛機「鋼二」、這是飛機技術上的革命、</p>
<p>一直到一九一三年爲止、蘇聯民用航空隊的運輸飛機、只知道有外國的摩托、因此蘇聯必須從事建立自己飛機發動機工業、運輸飛機的發動機之造成、是一九三一年年底、當時造有Mr5和Ｍ２６兩種、蘇聯工業之這種初步的出品、其不足以適應對於飛機發動機的需要、是容易瞭解的事、這種飛機無論在時速方面、耐用方面、和製造之質的方面、都不足以滿足現代的需要、因此、飛機工業、極大從事製造質料較好的和耐久的摩托、今年摩托已有很大的改造、運輸飛機ANT9不用帶冷氣的三摩托、而用帶冷水二摩托、這種摩托也是蘇聯的出品、因此、飛機的速度從而加快、尤其是得到更大的安全、Ｋ５飛機上的Ｍr5的摩托、亦爲其他蘇聯的摩托所代替了、</p>
<p>蘇聯飛機摩托工業之成立、是一種非常偉大的成績、如果製造飛機的主要的困難是在缺乏建築師、缺乏技術人才的話、那麽製造摩托的困難便不止這些了、蘇聯鋼業水平線之低下、大大障碍着摩托之製造、只有改進鋼業、改善冶鋼和鍊鋼的技術、才可以供給摩托製造以必要的原料和技術的基礎、今日在蘇聯以合理化的方法製造質上很新式的飛機摩托、</p>
<p>是已經完全實現了、</p>
<p>空運經濟不止是製造飛機和製造飛機摩托而已、新式的飛機場極需要特别的停機和起飛的設備、一九三二年美國共有飛機塲和停機場二零九四個、設備費用約值八萬萬金元、蘇聯飛機場較美國極爲落後、較大部歐洲國家也都落後、</p>
<p>但是蘇聯在最近幾年間、用在民用空運經上的費亦頗可觀、一九二九年國家預算僅規定民用航空經費五百萬盧布、一九三零年民用空運實支的經費計達三千萬盧布、一九三一年增至一三零百萬盧布一、九三二年又增至一五零百萬盧布、今年應爲一七零百萬盧布、這許多經費將使民用航空隊得以澈底改造、爲蘇聯造成趕上世界上航空事業最先進國家的基礎、（譯自莫思科週一九三三年二月十二日第七期）、</p>
<h3>美國銀行恐慌（第一信）</h3>
<p>（二月二十八日）</p>
<p>熱望的預言家、天天嚷着「恐慌潮平定了、繁榮已經開始、資本主義的新時代、即將到來、」然而事實却與之相反、新恐慌的破壞、又在一發而不不可收拾、世界資本主義行將從此更形衰落了、</p>
<p>二月中旬、美國密執安州「保護人聯合托拉斯公司」Union　Guardian　Trust　Company）即大福特托拉斯（Ford　Trust）的私人銀行、發生很大的風潮、把密執安、俄海阿、英的安納、賓夕爾發尼亞各州六百個銀行、同時牽入恐慌的漩渦、這六百銀行、其資本共計不下十五萬萬金元、上述各州中所有銀行和儲蓄行因而必須停業一星期、全部經濟活動完全停頓、</p>
<p>現在密執安州的銀行還在關門大吉、明尼蘇達州和紐折爾西州同樣走上密執安州所走的道路美國銀行制度根本動搖因此交易「削弱」、行市大跌、使有價證券之交易、大受限制、更從而准備着掀起新的風潮、經濟恐慌之新尖銳化、已經是顧而易見的了、</p>
<p>銀行街少數財力尙充足的大銀行如Morgaa　Chaso　Narional　Guaranty　Trust等等、則利用恐慌之新尖銳化、以擴充他們的勢力範圍、底得律（密執安州）「保護、</p>
<p>人聯合托拉斯公司」發生風潮後、不到幾個鐘頭、銀行街的大銀行、即宣告與以「援助」、這就是說、如果底得律銀行願抛棄自己的獨立權而加入他們的話、他們便寄欵給該銀行、銀行街大銀行若能得到「保護人聯合托拉斯公司」之加入、那對於奪取汽車工業方面、必有極大的進展、蓋汽車工業至今主要地都是與自己的底得律銀行合作的、這種合作如果不夠的話、便與支加哥銀行資本合作、</p>
<p>一直到現在底得律銀行、還是在努力抵抗、但是她却早已抵抗不住了、紐約的大銀行、首先就是要「征服」這底得律銀行、然後再及支加哥及其他比較獨立的銀行中心、</p>
<p>根據佛拉（P.Frey）在上議院調查委員會上的報告、很容易看出紐約銀行勢力之偉大、佛拉把許多紐約銀行經理屬下的監視委員會分派處作成統計、以表現銀行街銀行資本之勢力及其奥美國工業結合的程度、</p>
<p>根據佛拉研究的結果、十六家紐約最大的私人銀行、在紐約重要的公立銀行中、共有監視委員會分派處七十一處、此外在全國最大的工業工廠中、共有監視委員會特派員九百九十六處、</p>
<p>紐約八家最大的公立銀行、共有監視委員會特派員三千七百四十一處、其分佈如下、</p>
<p>保險公司　　二八七、</p>
<p>其他的銀行　三○一、</p>
<p>瓦斯水電廠　五二一、</p>
<p>鐡路輪船航空運輸等公司　五八五、</p>
<p>工業企業　八四六、</p>
<p>其他的公司　一二○一、</p>
<p>這八個公立銀行之最大者是Chase　National　Bank、這銀行用這種監視委員會特派員的帮助、單獨支配着八百二十八家公司、</p>
<p>此外這些大銀行又是極密切地互相勾結着的、（在相互激烈競爭之下）</p>
<p>這些大銀行繼續吸收新銀行、使新銀行以某種形式依靠着自己、把資本投入新銀行中、於是大銀行之勢力、更形偉大、然而大銀行之組織却因此更形不統一、更容易發生動搖、</p>
<p>底得律銀行是必須放棄她的獨立了、現在的問題是、還是加入支加哥銀呢行、還是直接加入紐約銀行、如果不在支加哥轉個灣兒、馬上直接加入紐約銀行的話、那末、密執安州馬上便要到來的第二次銀行風潮、便不是底得律銀行的事、而是銀行街大銀行底得律「支行」的事了、</p>
<p>就現狀言、密執安州銀行風潮之影響所及、已經引起一般地在美國各銀行中提取存欵的現象了、因爲人們認爲今日在密執安州所發生的風潮、明日也就可以在賓夕爾發尼亞、勿爾吉尼阿、或其他地方發生、但如果底得律銀行成爲銀行街「支行」的話、則下次的銀行風潮、將使紐約銀行自顧不暇、其影響就完全兩樣了、所以美國目前的銀行恐慌、一方面使美國銀行制度繼續尖銳化、同時且造成更大的恐慌之基礎、</p>
<h3>陳濟棠代表楊德昭今晨到滬</h3>
<p>將在滬候謁蔣委員長後入京</p>
<p>粤援熱軍俟會齊閩軍卽出發</p>
<p>陳濟棠代表楊德昭、偕其夫人、與汪精衛秘書李浩駒夫婦、由香港同乘胡佛總統號來滬、於今晨八時半抵此、新聲社記者、晤之於輪次、楊表示俟在滬候晤蔣委員長後、再行入京、粤抗日軍、俟會齊閩步隊、即出發北上、兹分誌楊氏談話如次、</p>
<p>候蔣會晤　楊氏謂本人原擬乘加拿大皇后輪來滬、嗣因事改乘胡佛總統輪、到滬後、擬先謁宋副院長、探詢蔣委員長到滬確期、在滬候謁蔣氏、報告一切、然後再行入京、謁見汪院長、</p>
<p>勦匪軍事　江西勦匪軍事、自蔣委員長北上抗日後、該項工作、并未停頓、仍在積極進行中、蔣委員長之意、本擬請陳伯南氏擔任、陳氏亦因粤方各事繁重、故不能負其全責、余漢謀氏亦不過擔任其工作之一部份而已、名義未定、須得謁晤蔣汪後、始可知、</p>
<p>即將出師　勦共工作、粤方將派○○團擔任、粤本可早出師、嗣因缺乏輜重隊之組織、其運輸須募夫、適值春耕、一時不易募集、因不得不向湘桂各省招募、一俟完竣、即可於一二日内動員出發、將來大約先開拔駐軍之十分之三、然後漸出至十分之八、至第十九軍長蔡廷鍇、亦决出師援熱、</p>
<p>財政困難　關於勦匪經費、較爲困難、前粤方經費、多係由華僑方面捐得之欵、近因華僑商業失敗、每年减少一百餘萬之收益、輸出貿易亦復不佳、以致財政奇絀、故粤軍費祗五成、此次如戰匪軍費果眞無辦法時、亦祇有請中央予以補助、但并非要挾行爲、實出於不得已也</p>
<p>援熱抗日　至粤方出師援熱抗日、卽將動員、并無救國軍等任何名義之規定、仍用原有之獨立第四師番號、俟會齊閩方之十九路軍部隊、到達相當地點、即可出發、</p>
<p>外交一致　至西南對外交方面之主張、當然與中央一致、即所謂抗日勦共、不抗日則無外交可言、能抗日而後方始有外交可辦、此節當與汪精衛先生所言者相同、至本人在港、並未謁晤胡展堂氏、故胡氏并無函件交本人帶來、僅陳伯南氏有一函交轉達蔣委員長、然此亦常常往者、内容殊不外上述、希望抗日勦匪、將匪共肅清後、則方可以抗日與勦共、實有聯帶關係、至妥協之外交、自非吾人所敢贊成者、非特陳氏個人如此主張、即一般武裝同志亦均同此見地云、</p>

<h3>自由在那裏？</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>昨天報載，據世界新聞社詩家谷電，近正在美國各地旅行演講的相對論的發見者愛因斯坦氏，因反對德國希特勒領導下的國家社會黨所表顯的法西斯蒂主義，最近託詩埠友人台維斯推事發表彼若爲事態所許可，願入美國籍爲自由國之一公民云，</p>
<p>這一個聲明，是希特勒巨棒所引起的國内上層階級向海外揭發的第一個反響，我們對愛氏渴求自由的精神，無任同情，但方法似未免有點錯誤，</p>
<p>所謂「自由」，當然以大多數人民爲對象，現時的美國，摩根與福特等輩固然萬分自由，而且可以左右一國的政治，但一千二百萬被人間遺棄的工人是除外，他們雖然也與摩根福特等同頂着「自由國民」或是「黄金國民」的榮譽，值得如愛氏之流的羡慕，但自由是被掠奪了，黄金也永流不到他們的袋中，他們所有的只是「飢寒」「貧困」等等生之威脅，事實上正與在德國希特勒巨棒下的六百萬失業工人走着同一的「厄運」，這原無足希奇，在資本主義的國家裏，原也不少掠奪得來的自由，不獨是美國，不幸愛氏所歌誦的便是這一類的自由，而不是大衆的自由，</p>
<p>我不懂，以劃時代的思想家的愛氏，能發現於對論原理以推倒牛頓，而不能發現美國現存矛盾的事實，丨一方面濫用自由，如燒燬小麥，限種棉田，一方面却爲飢寒貧困所包圍着的那一種事實，以追踵馬克司，這原因我想大概在愛氏的聽衆中没有一個囚首垢面的工人的緣故吧，丨不差，在飢寒交迫的人，實在没有餘暇來聽四度空間的偉論的，然而愛氏也太短見了，</p>
<p>論自由，固不在德國，但也决不在美國，讓我們且來讀日本人丨帝國主義的一份子的供狀吧，最近喧騰一時的日僞所訂的所謂「中華聯邦密約」上，開頭就這樣寫着「現在世界上只有二種國家，一種是資本主義，英美日意法，一種是共産主義，蘇俄……」日人的供狀，很可以給愛氏及一切渴求自由的人們借鏡，在這世界的另一角，那佔有六分之一的土地上還有自由生長着呢，愛氏要是求的眞自由，那一定不以取得美國籍爲滿足，否則即一點反抗精神，也無足貴！</p>

<h3>五百死士歌</h3>
<p>— 錢夢苕</p>
<p>三月九日，萬福麟軍自寬城敗退，賊軍占喜峰口，宋哲元軍聞變立赴，傍晚抵長城，馮治安師五百死士，赤臂持刀登城，出賊不意盡殺之，斃賊一千，而五百人者亦同殉。</p>
<p>砲車雲塞喜峯口，黑纛草山賊騎走，倭來倭來撞令郎，吞江吸海勢莫當，孤城突兀烟塵裏，一霎吹唇沸地起，此時五百横衝都，如山氣湧奮臂呼，風駛電掣百餘里，半日已薄長城趾，前者爬山雄虎彪，後者奪城飛猿猱，短兵突出萬賊恐，人聲馬聲噤不動，五百死士心同仇，今日駢死同首邱，九上九下刀鋒利，賊頭滾滾紛落地，鐡龍翻城城欲摧，須臾已變髑髏臺，憋腸狗態逃不速，它它籍籍塡阬谷，三平之劍正宗刀，不堪狼藉委戰壕，是役賊軍圖營獲，明治以來無此辱，雁飛月黑秦時關，忠魂碎擲無一還，青白旗下乃有此，五百壯士同日死，</p>
<h3>前線一封信</h3>
<p>— 嘵</p>
<p>娟，</p>
<p>我眞没想到；在當初，我會有這樣的勇氣撇了你，撇了媽媽的墳，從江南的冬天，跑到這兒更冷的天氣裏來，更没想到；你竟會讓我走得那麽痛快，不像下河頭老王家的，拖泥帶水的哭啦！尋死啦！眞糟，要是中國女人全那樣，不是完啦？</p>
<p>在家裏時，我不是對你說過嗎？咱們中國人壞的只曉得家裏有媽，爸，老婆，孩子，祖宗，所以想找錢，當漢奸·掙勢派，做傀儡·這樣行嗎？他們全把這偌大的中國忘啦！可是話又說回來了！咱們不怪老百姓，就怨這些當官兒的混蛋，把老百姓害得那麽窮，國那麽弱·總有一天，這些小子不再好好的幹·哼！老百姓會處理他們的·可是，現在咱們得先把日本人打退再說。</p>
<p>唉！提起日本人，就聯想到當亡國奴·眞寒心，我們的一隊裏就有三個高麗人·白天躱在高梁田没事，就談起天來·他說，他的祖父伯父父親，全給日本人斃啦！一爿綢莊，三百响地，全充了公，只剩下他一個光身，有志氣，不受日本人管；跑到中國，不討飯，來找李隊長，加入我們一夥打日本人，他還說：「我們韓國雖亡，還出了個安重根，我們呢？孫中山！三民主義也没見什麽功效·張學良！人家炸死了他爸還不抵抗！唉！眞難受，塌台，在亡國奴前還丢臉。</p>
<p>所以咱們得拚命的幹一下呀！</p>
<p>上個月，在索屯倫的三道河，那時，砲火頂利害，日本人在老高堡頂上架起機關槍，迫擊砲·咱們呢？每人腰裏只有二十顆子彈，六個饝饝，李隊長眞會説，他說：「弟兄們咱們只要守到晚上·現在關裏的接濟，已經到了黄家台，等接濟一到就反攻，他媽的衝上老高堡，把那些王八羔子斃個痛丨！那個快字還没出口，轟一聲，傢伙，好利害！我伏在地上，待一忽兒，濃烟才散去·大家方站起來·一瞧，死三個，可憐那老會嘔人的高麗人也伏着不動了！一隻左手，抛去三丈遠，</p>
<p>於是，我們全躱進高粱；靜靜地等黄昏的到來，太陽漸漸地躱進老高堡的鼓樓，月亮從高粱頂上慢慢地升起來，刺骨的風，吹得把影子動起來，老遠的莊子裏，隠約有二三點火星·這不是黄昏嗎？接濟還没來嗎？大家悄悄地猜着：正猜着，李隊長喊我們出高粱田排隊伍·啊！接濟來社嗎？但是，立在我們前面的，是那麽一個悲壯的聲音啊！「剛才黄家台來人說，後方送來的接濟，在大兒溝被截了！所有前綫軍隊，全退，在黄家台集中·但是，弟兄們，咱們來時，不曾說過嗎？只進不退，那末，咱們還是丨？他把進退兩個字逗留在嘴裏，望着弟兄的回答。</p>
<p>猛烈的衝鋒開始了！娟，恕我不把這樣能使你心抖脈跳的故事告訴你吧！我祗記得，在插上刺刀時，我從弟兄們的身上衝去，我曾用這雪亮的刀，劈下兩隻肩膀·刺穿三個喉管·現在，回憶起來，連自己也疑惑那時的勇敢·曾記得；在家時，有一天，咱倆坐在院子裏的階沿上談天；一隻耗子從土洞裏爬出來·我駭得呌起來，你還笑我呢？這樣胆小還上前線去？</p>
<p>雖然，以七十個人的犧牲，死了一百三十多個日本人，但是我們剩下的只有十二個人，我們不得不退了！現在，我在黄家台的三十七聯隊司令部，你有信，可託上海義勇軍後援會轉來·</p>
<p>你……………………</p>
<p>呌號又在吹了…………恕我…………</p>

<h3>愛情是不是同時可以容納幾個人的</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>不見得貴刋祗限於男子有詢問疑難的權利罷？</p>
<p>先生！我是某大國貨社的售貨員。現在有一件很難解决的問題，整日價纒繞着我弱小的心靈。使我寢食不安；雖然絞盡了腦汁支配這難於支配的事，究竟找不到適當的辦法。所以很冒昧的懇求先生，憑着先生的卓見，替優柔寡斷的弱女子，想個方法。現在把事實大略的來告訴你。</p>
<p>我們公司裏除了男同事之外，祗有六七個女同事。我們時常可以聽到男人們在營業空閒的時候，團圜圍聚着品評我們。說也羞煞，他們竟毫無忌憚的把××皇后的頭銜冠上我的頭上，我一半兒是羞！一半兒是恨！</p>
<p>從此以後，他們對待我的感情，也一天一天濃厚起來。寫情書給我的也有，打烊後送我回家的也有，有時在工作的時候，即使是我責任所在，能力所及的事，他們總會自告奮勇的替我去做，好像我當不起這種勞苦似的：先生！同時我得告訴你，他們毫無輕薄和假殷勤的態度，完全是眞摯的扶助。</p>
<p>光陰這樣不斷地向前推動，他們也加緊地向我追求。父母很鍾愛我，什麽都不成問題。但是，暗地裏詳細的把每人的個性和才能逐漸的考察，各人有各人的特長和優點，唉！一重重糢糊的黑影强有力的浮起在心頭！</p>
<p>熊掌我所願也，魚亦我所願也。我不能抛棄那一個，也不忍犧牲那一個，眞的，難捨難分，最好能夠照單全收。先生！處在這種冷酷而矛盾的社會裏，事實能夠允許我接受多方面的愛麽？如果依着自己的成見去實行，會不會受社會人仕的枰擊與咒咀？對於我的前途有没有妨礙與痛苦，先生我不肯離開任何一個人，我要接受幾個人的愛，我决絕地躍出舊禮敎的牢籠，剷除愛途的礙障。天賦的智力，已經無形的被侵襲而失却效用了。</p>
<p>先生！我心兒痛，眼兒酸，請你發發慈悲心吧，替初出茅廬的女子，想個至善至美的方法，應該如何應付這終身大事的開始呢？</p>
<p>本想請你直接覆信來指導我，因爲有許多不便，隨便如何，請你不要棄諸字紙簏，詳細地在報上答覆我，先生，我像大旱之望雲霓般的期待着，</p>
<p>編者按：金女士來信所說的愛，當然並不是指普通廣義的愛，而是指兩性間的愛了。兩性間的愛，據一般學者討論的結果，認爲是整個的，不能部分的（Infractionable）。一般人，或者可以說任何人，對於他的愛人，總不免有獨占的野心。一個女子，同時接受許多人的愛，受社會人士的抨擊咒咀，是不值得我們過慮的；但是事實上會，而且一定會，發生妨碍與痛苦，却不能不顧到呀！在男女兩方互相追求的時候，當然似乎不成問題；但是一到進一步的時候，問題就立刻發生，據犯罪心理學家的報告，雖說「金錢占有慾，」也是犯罪的强有力的動機，但「愛的占有慾，」比較的更加普徧。</p>
<p>金女士對於她許多的男同事，以爲他們各有各的長處，各有各的優點：這大概因爲「她的智力，已經無形的被侵襲而失却效用」的緣故。我們知道世界上絕對没有兩件東西，完全銖兩悉稱，分不出高低。即使各人的長處和優點，因爲途徑各異，譬如有的長於口才，有的長於學識，可以使得一個「優柔寡斷」的女子，如「墜五里霧中」，分辯不出高低來。但是你要知道擇婿的標準丨尤其是像金女土那樣已有職業，可以自立的女子丨並不在對方的學識能力，而在對方的人格道德，更其是對方的情意。你不妨丢開了其他的方面，專就這一方面去觀察：要是外表上再分不出來，那末須要用些手腕，試他們一試；一時看不出來，那末不妨忍着性兒，慢慢的看着。中國故事裏邊，有一叚「賣油郎獨占花魁女」的一節，（請恕擬不於倫）想來你也看過。惟這種有眞摯情意的人，才是終身的良伴。</p>
<p>萬一金女士當眞被他們纏個不了，失却判别的權威。我們勸你對於他們的心，一發完全冷淡下來，你要曉得「一個女子同時愛上許多男子，是不可能的呀」！或許你的心一冷，智力就可回復，那時再在他們中間，選定一個；欲擒先縱，也未始非一個妙策呢！</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（十七續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「很好！很好！」伍逸對於這兩位仁兄的遭遇，都一般的表示欣慰，並不下什麽批評。………………………………………………</p>
<p>「你是怎樣結婚的？」兩個人談了一會，伍逸忽然提出了這一個問題來。　　「我是爲結婚而結婚的！我的目的是養兒子！哈哈！現在可達到了」王玉麟很爽直坦白的說道：「人家大都是爲戀愛而結婚，而我却是一個已經失戀的人了；所以去年便抱着爲結婚而結婚的主義，把選擇配偶的全權，歸還給我的老子，結果就在幾百個賀客的監視之下，娶了一個老婆。但是，………………」</p>
<p>「但是，成績倒不錯！」伍逸帶着滑稽的口氣，代替他接濟了一旬。</p>
<p>「眞的，成績很好！她是一個四德俱全的好姑娘。」玉麟和盤托出的招供着：「所以，我現在已有了一重新的覺悟：我已爲那些抱着爲戀愛而結婚底主義的人們，在婚後未必都能得到什麽樂趣，倒是爲結婚而結婚的人却常有意外的幸福獲得；理由很顯明，因爲前者希望過高，轉易失望，後者原不存什麽奢望，祗須略有一二滿意之處，便很知足而愉快了！老伍！士别三日，刮目相看，你别笑我不長進啊！」</p>
<p>伍逸和麥娥以前所發生的一番關係，差不多已銷磨了他的一半的勇氣，麥娥現在雖然是死了，他却更覺得惆悵難堪。尤其是當他在金元國的三年裏，平均每一個禮拜，總可以在報紙上讀到幾十條離婚的新聞的影象，分外使他心灰意懶：對於戀愛，追求，…………這些每一個未婚者所奉爲日課的工作，也深深地感到了乏味。因此，王玉麟的一番見解，竟立刻取得了他的同情。</p>
<p>「你的高見很對，不過，依我個人的環境而論，却又不行！第一我没有老子，」說到老子，伍逸不由聯想起他的祖父，和他的母親，便越發覺得自己也有爲結婚而結婚的必要了。「要找人代我選擇配偶，倒不是一件容易的事情！」　　「不難！不難！這差使交給我辦，準不會錯！」王玉麟暗忖伍逸今年已是二十九歲了，確乎也有爲結婚而結婚的需要了，忙自告奮勇起來。「祗要你保證我並不曾在美國跟什麽人訂過婚，我便馬上可以把你這件事情責成我的妻子，敎她介紹一個同學給你。她是下女中學的學生，儘有許多很漂亮的同學………………………………！」</p>
<p>伍逸很幽默地笑着，並不表示可否；後來的幾天，他又忙着跟星報館的總編輯接洽連任的問題，一時無暇及此，便漸漸地忘懷了。不料王玉麟眞是一個最熱心的朋友。隔不到兩個月，便依着掉换照片，致送年庚的一番半新不舊的締婚手續，把他夫人的一位貴同學丨丨劉素珍女士，像帮票似的帮爲伍逸博士夫人。</p>
<p>「想不到像你這樣一位飽灌着新思想的留學生，竟能這樣遷就地解决了你的婚事！」一個很知道他底細的同事，在吃喜酒的那天，用觀察一般普通的博士碩士們的眼光，向他表示詫異：認爲一個留學生何以不談戀愛，一個留學生何以不追求一個女的留學生，實在是一種很反常的舉動。</p>
<p>「抱歉得很！我有我的主義：」伍逸很從容地答道：「我不願爲戀愛而結婚，我不願爲替報紙製造新聞而結婚，所以我就懶得跟一般摩登的姑娘們先談戀愛，然後結婚了；我更不想爲研究學問而結婚，當然無需娶一個留學生做妻子。說爽快些，我是爲結婚而結婚！」</p>

<h3>影片之復攝</h3>
<p>— 興之</p>
<p>晚近好萊塢之影業已趨向競爭最劇烈的時期，英國的禁止電影明星出國，德國的利用科學積極整頓，法國俄國政府的鼓勵電影事業都足使好萊塢提心吊膽。近兩個月來，攝製非常謹愼。每有一部新片出來，在試映的時候，發現一二瑕疵，就立刻拿這不好的一叚復攝。常有因復攝而額外損失達萬元以上的，可見犧牲精神的大了。</p>
<p>在以前復攝的機會有時也有的，最使人忘不了的有一次試映「西線無戰事，」片中的悲角就是，苦面女人散蘇碧茨。不料這位散蘇碧茨在銀幕上現了出來，來參觀試片的都大笑起來，於是這一片中剪去了一大叚而復攝了，而散蘇碧茨的悲角也換了别人。</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱在她的近作「復興，」一片裏，曾費八個星期的充陰，四星期練習，四星期攝片並且辛苦出病來。然而試映後發覺了要重拍的幾處，而曼麗因此不得不抱病工作。</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉寳的「重見天日」As　You　Dosire　Ｍe試映後，葛萊泰在咖啡館中充侍女跳舞的一叚，和後來夫婦相逢的一叚都是復攝過的。這二叚是全片的精彩處，當然是要緊的。</p>
<p>雷電華公司的新片「犧牲」Rockabye主角是康絲登裴納和佐麥克利，佐麥克利攝了没有幾幕因爲家裏有事離了好萊塢，雷電華就請費利潑福爾摩斯PhilliPs　Holmes代佐麥克利，結果不滿意的很多，於是等麥克利面回來後復攝，而應了片名，「犧牲」了萬元以上的金錢。</p>
<p>葛羅里亞史璜生的新片「了解」Ｐeifec　Understanding拍完後發現須復攝一叚，而男主角已起程到歐州去了，不得不拍電報請他回來。</p>
<p>希佛萊的新片One　Hour　With　You試映後須重拍，而希佛萊在紐約不能脫身，於是導演攝片以及其他的演員都跑到紐約去復攝。</p>
<p>葛麗安特麗的新片「龍吼」曾復攝過三次，安哈婷的「西方去」也復攝過二次，二片都是雷電華的出品，比較起來雷電華公司的復攝片多，犧牲精神大，雷電華之能躍登好萊塢第二把椅子，不是容易的，在這裏可以看出來。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「肉」Flesh</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>本片述一忠誠率直的男子，熱戀一個女郎而和她結婚，但因爲他不善於温存，而妻又另有情人，所以夫妻間時常齟齬。其後終於和好如初。</p>
<p>本片以擅長描寫爲特色，所以在故事方面，必須曲折離奇。正因爲全劇的精采，在於表演的超羣出衆，所以整個的結構很可以使華勒斯皮萊（ＷallaceBeery）盡量發揮。</p>
<p>誰都知道華勒斯皮萊的表演技術，的確是非常成功的。他在銀幕上獨樹風格，所謂以描寫精細見長，在本片中，我們很可以看出他對於心情的變化，是在怎樣的體貼入微。可以說在任何一個塲面中，他都注意到了自身的責任。假如我們看過了詹寗斯所表演的「慾潮」，那末便意識到這二片，確是不相上下的。</p>
<p>關於本片的導演，當然帮助於主角不少，而且他對於全劇的運用，又是那般周密。無疑義的，一個好的影片，導演當負有極大的責任，假如華勒斯皮萊在這一片子中遇不着好的導演，那末他决不會有這樣成功的。</p>
<p>至於那個女主角，以及那飾女主角之情人的Ｖicardo　Cortey,都是演得相當好的。除了有些地方，近於過火之外，大部份都很適當。</p>
<p>燈光，佈景，收音等均臻上乘。</p>
<p>結語是表演細膩，導演亦佳。</p>
<h3>評「蠟美人」丨卡爾登及「健康運動」</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>這一次舞臺上，仍舊是上次那一班人，不過爲了影片關係，歌舞比已往的短。其中最好的，仍推兩黑人的「蹕躂舞」，大致和上次差不多。</p>
<p>舞臺劇以外，有兩部影片，「健康運動」，是一部兩本的詼諧影片，在技術上，還算不錯，其餘没有什麽可說的</p>
<p>第二部「蠟美人」The　Indiseretionsof　Ｅve是一部滑稽的喜劇，比上次的「獨占鰲頭」要勝百倍了。</p>
<p>劇情也許没什麽可說吧？僅僅的說一位爵士，愛了一個女郎，這女郎是「彫塑臘人」公司的模特兒，已經和那公司的經理訂過婚了。爵士單戀，竟買了些像這女郎的蠟美人，大演其愛情劇。　　　　　　竟達到目的。二人偕往歐蠟　　　　　　生活。</p>
<p>這劇中，是八位演員共同努力所造成的優良結果。每一個人的一言一動，都有美好的笑料，可以誇一句「處處生色」。每一個都是屬於上乘的，特别是極滑稽的言動，和曼妙的歌舞。配角都佔了穿插的重要部份，合唱的Chorus非常令人興奮，在表面上，這片子給你的是「歡笑」和「美感」。</p>
<p>這是滑稽片中很難能的，牠並不是過份的無理取閙，而能呌你笑不可仰。</p>
<p>這片子有機會就唱就舞。對白極少，而且極淺近。</p>
<p>導演當然是全片第一大功臣，手腕的活潑，令人佩服，因爲歌舞片雖然容易拍，但是要脫俗超羣，却是比任何種影片都困難些。鏡頭運用和角度，都有新奇的發現。光線剪接，没一個地方，不是極端的新頴，同時佈景也是有力的陪襯着。發音也很準確。配樂不但悅耳，還有些幽默的意味。</p>
<p>這兩部影片丨丨「健康運動」和「臘美人」丨丨在意識上，雖找不出什麽，但是我們却可以看出英國的許多觀念和思想。至少牠們也足以表示着歐州的電影的進步，大可以與美國爭「一日之長短」。</p>
<h3>明星公司演劇籌欵</h3>
<p>— 氷花</p>
<p>▲努力航空救國運動</p>
<p>▲全體女星演大跑車</p>
<p>在宼禍日深，國難日亟的現時期中，大家喊着「航空救國」的口號，合力從事於籌募機欵的運動。愛國士女，相率參加。電影界中，利用他們自己富有號召的能力丨表演戲劇，爲公衆事業服務籌欵，向來很極踴躍。現明星公司爭先從事，已經定期四月一日，假座中央大戲院，日夜演劇兩塲。售欵所得，悉充捐費。所定劇目都很精彩。最後「大溪皇莊」一齣，全體女明星全體導演一律參加表演大跑車。人才濟濟，薈萃一處的更屬難能可貴。預計此次成績，定必十分美滿也。</p>
<h3>評「愛的契約」Ｔhe　Love　Contract</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>這眞是一部滑稽喜劇，特别是那故事的結構太滑稽了。</p>
<p>很顯然的，生長在資本主義的空氣中的電影藝術家，他們對於正確意識之追求，可以說從來就没有這樣念頭。一個喜劇劇本的産生，只求它在銀幕上能夠使觀衆笑，無目的的笑，笑了之後還要笑，於是這劇的演出便爲一般觀衆所稱道了。</p>
<p>關於這一點，本片正是好例。</p>
<p>然而關於演出的技巧，可以說是不壞的。特别是導演的手腕，的確是非常靈活的。他將全劇情調，調和得十分明媚，使我們在不知不覺以接受了劇的活潑與和諧。當然，這是最不易於做到的。至於導演對於鏡頭的運用也是很技術的剪接極佳。</p>
<p>演員方面，我們可得到甚至於一個的極不重要的配角，都能適合劇情。男女主角的表演，都是很生動的。尤其是那女主角蕭德（Winifred　Shotter）的確是玲瓏小巧。</p>
<p>燈光佈景等都不減色。收音很清朗。</p>
<p>整個的說來，本劇的演出的成績，是相當成功的。但是在意義上却是有意的歪曲。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>由「都會的早晨」說到「城市之夜」</h3>
<p>— 椀</p>
<p>「城市之夜」和「都會的早晨」都是聯華的出品，都是富有革命性，都有極大的號召力。</p>
<p>「都會的早晨」的題材·猛聽着，是比「城市之夜」來得興奮些·因爲苦悶的人生·誰不願走上光明的大道咧？但是，看過了「都會的早晨」以後，我覺得是失望了·因爲牠的劇情與題材完全不同啊！除了第一幕，和結局一幕，用攝影的技術，表現著早晨之外，片中的故事，何嘗有什麽光明之路，可以探尋呢？「城市之夜」的情節，描寫得多末深刻，尖銳，而緊張啊！在「都會的早晨」裏邊，雖然也是拿貧富兩方來對照，但是情節就差的多了。况且「城市之夜」是從黑暗中，向着光明之路，掙扎前進·「都市的早晨」是在光明裏，發現些黑暗的事情·再想由黑暗裏走上光明的大道。他導演的意識是這樣的，但是終於没有這樣雄偉的力量來運用，所以除了做成幾幕，推車向太陽邊走的描寫之外，另外却没有什麽中心思想，可以暗示到這一點的！</p>
<p>還有「都市的早晨」裏面許多地方完全是模仿「城市之夜」來的·未看過「城市之夜」的人們還不覺得，凡是看過「城市之夜」的，就不免感覺乏味了·</p>
<h3>評「萬花獻媚」</h3>
<p>— 聲宏</p>
<p>這一部「萬花獻媚」的中心點，是滑稽和歌舞合奏，全片充溢着，香艶，歌舞，滑稽；但滑稽不是胡閙的滑稽，而是含着幽默和人生的意義。</p>
<p>導演因題材關係，所以把歌舞和滑稽儘量發展，成功一部熱閙的片子，手腕倒很靈巧活潑，把劇中人指揮得井井有條。毫不混亂，不過有許多很可描摹的地方却輕輕放過，未免可惜。分幕以及鏡頭角度的靈活，可作國産片的借鏡</p>
<p>演員中要推埃第康脫最好，資格老練，演來又自然，又深刻，可惜有數幕顯出過火處。羅保特Roberti很能發揮劇中人的個性，並助長劇情的進展，其餘演員都平平。背景也很矞皇，有幾幕饒有詩意。</p>
<h3>雷門諾伐羅不願結婚</h3>
<p>— 郭聲宏</p>
<p>一年前，雷門諾伐羅和他家裏人，很快樂的住在一起。現在呢，他却離開美滿的家庭，單身獨住於鄕村的小屋中了。</p>
<p>他的離開家庭，並不是和家庭間發生了什麽意見。他自始至終，忠實於自己的家庭。他不願追求異性，也不願結婚。</p>
<p>他用很悲傷的音調，對新聞記者說道：「假若我逢到單身孤女時，那我就和她結婚。否則我將終身不娶了。」</p>
<p>「我的家庭是由十一個人共同負責的。然而我却是一個唯一的負責最重的人。那十一個人是：我的父親，母親，五個兄弟，四個姊妹。這就是我不願結婚的最大原因。我的二個弟弟，都將完成他們的敎育，一個大學剛畢業，另一個今年六月畢業。這二個弟弟，都是「我的孩子，」我很滿足，我還結什麽婚呢？</p>
<p>我最小的弟弟他喜歡成功一個建築專家，我深信他的天才。我打算帶他往西班牙去。等到我第二次片子攝竣時，我就帶他往歐洲去參觀富麗堂皇的建築</p>
<p>我自信，我將終身不結婚，假若上帝使我結婚而生子，我恐怕上帝决不會給我像我弟弟般的「現成孩子，」我喜歡音樂和書本，亦是我不願結婚原因之一</p>
<h3>一九三三年好萊塢女明星的春裝</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在一九三三年開始之前，好萊塢的一般女明星，閙着一片新裝之聲。好萊塢便應時而起的産生了一個著名的成衣匠。他利用着過人的技巧和思想，發明許多新裝。式樣的新頴，尤非同行者所能及其萬一。他對人說，一九三三年的春天，好萊塢的一般女星，所穿的新裝，將更注意於光芒的四射。每個的她，都將買些閃閃發光的東西，綴在新裝的周圍，而古銅色將爲最盛行的顔色了，在披肩和馬甲的上面，將滿綴那維尼斯的金幣。另外還有一種新裝，便是圍巾的上面，都要别着一隻，用白銀或錫來做成的安全别針。果然，現在這位成衣匠所說的新裝，什麽都已實現了。</p>
<h3>亞爾喬爾生拖妻上塲</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>亞爾喬爾生的妻子，羅蓓凱鸞Ruby　Holer從前曾一度現身銀幕。現被亞爾喬爾生硬拖到了好萊塢，加入銀幕工作。羅勃凱鸞以不肯過故拂其意，故拍攝一部Hallelujah　I'm　aRum殊不料工作數天，成績極佳。聞决定繼續留於好萊塢云。</p>
<h3>電影小說賽珍會State　Fair</h3>
<p>— 蕙君</p>
<p>主演者丨珍妮蓋諾　惠爾羅吉士　劉亞烈斯莎麗媛鸞</p>
<p>月色照射在幽暗而崎嶇的路上，微風波動那路旁溺娜的稻枝。</p>
<p>亞爾勃駕着輕巧的福特貨車，到賽珍會去。他身伴，坐着他的凄美烈莎。在她肥胖得像猪的腿間，安置那盛貯着她準備參加比賽的自製酸菓和肉泥的盒子。亞勃爾和美烈莎的身後，坐着她們的子女，瑪姫和惠思。餘地給那碩大的木籛佔了，籠中安處的是亞勃爾抱絕大希望的白猪藍兒。他深信牠會獲選第一，還同雜貨店主賭五塊錢東道。</p>
<p>到會塲有一百念男路，惟恐白日的炎熱影響藍兒的健樂，他們垂晚便起程。路太崎嶇，車子顚簸地在搖顫，藍兒怨恨地在哼着。</p>
<p>惠恩仰首睨視那閃鑠的星點，無標準地幻想着在家鄕，那兒有他的愛人伊麗娜，將來他也許會娶她的。前面是充滿了爽心快樂的賽珍會。他想到去年受場的投環攤子。在一聲自負的冷笑之下，他想到自己把母親的繡花綳圈練習的情形。今年却要再去試一下。</p>
<p>惠恩旁邊，瑪姫遥望着那銀色的皎月，臉上露着微笑。她嘆息，她夢想，正和她哥哥一樣的無情緒。她想哈雷？他來送行時不是很誠懇的？他曾向她求婚丨熱忱地講着他倆將怎樣亨受蜜月。她的確被他麻醉過。</p>
<p>亞勃爾，何嘗不在沉思。但他的目標係藍兒的準能奪得錦標而没有不幸的事會發生。繼貨店主曾警告他虎烈拉的流行。也許不利於藍兒，還有浮薄的男女，專謗惑富庶的農家子女。終而，他自笑了。什麽不幸的事，都不見得會發生的。</p>

<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrive, Luandong is Quite Tense; An Armored Train Advances to the Shihe River; Our Troops Actively Prepare for Resistance; The Entire 16th Division is Transferred to Southern Rehe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, Yuguan saw the addition of four to five hundred Japanese soldiers, a combined force of infantry and artillery, with more seemingly on the way. An enemy armored train has advanced to the Shihe River to assist its infantry and cavalry in combat. According to Someya of the Qinhuangdao Japanese garrison, the Japanese army, having suffered defeats in battles at various passes of the Great Wall, intends to change its operational plan and advance towards Luandong. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese Kwantung Army plane flew over Qinhuangdao and dropped a bundle of communications to the Japanese camp, demanding that our army remove the fortifications at Shimenzhai and Qinhuangdao. Our garrison commander in Qinhuangdao, Liu Zhenying, resolutely ignored this and is actively preparing for resistance, and asked the Englishman Chilton to note that the Japanese army should be responsible for all losses in Kailuan in the future during the war. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the enemy has been unable to conquer the various passes of the Great Wall for a long time, it is now transferring the entire 16th Division from the Japanese mainland to southern Rehe to participate in the fighting. The remaining troops of the 6th and 14th Divisions left in the Liaoning and Jilin areas are also being transported south one after another. Recently, due to the unfavorable attack on the various passes of the Great Wall, the Japanese side intends to change its plan to attack North China, attacking Duolun to the west and invading Chahar, and attacking Luandong to the east. Our troops are prepared, and a major battle should take place within days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Qinhuangdao telegram: Over a thousand cavalry from the rebel Zhang Hai peng's forces advanced to the Mizigou and Lijiapu area yesterday, heading towards Jiumenkou to reinforce. Enemy cavalry on the east bank of the Shihe River are constantly probing towards our position, but have been repelled by our troops. The situation in the Shihe River area is becoming increasingly tense. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain military expert, the recent silence at various passes and the sudden tension on the eastern front suggest that the enemy's intention is focused on the entire North China, invading Qinhuangdao and Yuluan in the east and attempting to seize Chahar province in the west, adopting a large encirclement strategy against us north of the Yellow River. Its first phase of military operations is north of the Great Wall, and the second phase is north of our Yellow River. This is clearly evidenced by the military maps found on the enemy by Song's troops. Now its second phase of military operations has been launched against us, and our countrymen should quickly wake up to this. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: Since the enemy at Jiumenkou was defeated by our ambush, they have repeatedly shown signs of reinforcement in recent days, and there have been frequent clashes between the patrols of both sides. At about 6:00 AM on the 29th, suddenly about two hundred enemy infantry, cavalry, and mixed Japanese and puppet troops advanced from Shanguodian towards Qianshuiying. They were fiercely attacked by the soldiers guarding the position of our certain regiment. At the same time, a part of a certain unit climbed the mountains and detoured to the enemy's flank, concentrating fire on the enemy. The enemy gradually showed signs of wavering. At about 7:00 AM, another 60 or 70 enemy reinforcements moved from the Baiguoshu heights towards our right flank, but our officers and soldiers calmly responded and fired at them with mortars and direct-fire guns. By about 2:00 PM, the enemy at Qianshuiying was unable to withstand and retreated in disarray along the entire line to the Zhaojiayu area. Our troops are still firmly holding their original positions. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shimen, Qin, have seen intense battles recently. The Japanese army sent a large force from Yiyuan Kou to reinforce, attempting to seize Shimenzhai, and a fierce street fight immediately broke out. The enemy first sent several bombers to fly over Shimenzhai and indiscriminately drop bombs. Most of the bombs dropped yesterday were incendiary bombs, so most of the houses in the entire village were destroyed by fire, with flames soaring into the sky. Shimenzhai will become the second Zhabei. (30th Hualian Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) North China now feels calm, and the sense of security is gradually recovering. However, the Chinese authorities still maintain a curfew from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.

<h3>Central Standing Committee Resolves to Convene a Temporary National Congress on July 1st; The National Assembly Will Be Decided by the National Congress; Committee Member Wang's Resignation as President of the Executive Yuan is Difficult to Approve; Wang Jingwei Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8:00 AM on the 30th, the Central Government held its 64th Standing Committee meeting, attended by Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Chiang Kai-shek, Gu Mengyu, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, and 53 other people, chaired by Chiang Kai-shek, and resolved the following important cases:</p>
<p>(1) The case of the Standing Committee members requesting to convene a Temporary National Congress on July 1, 1933, was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved that the Standing Committee believes that the National Assembly should be convened in advance, and this case should be submitted to the Temporary National Congress for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>(3) It was resolved that Committee Member Wang Zhaoming's resignation from his concurrent position as President of the Executive Yuan is difficult to approve, and he should resume his duties immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Article 10 of the Revised Regulations on Rewards for Patriotic Donations from Overseas Chinese was amended.</p>
<p>(5) Committee Member Wu Chaochu was nominated to report at the Central Memorial Week next Monday.</p>
<p>(6) Other routine cases. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Standing Committee meeting adjourned, Wang told reporters, "Today's Central Standing Committee resolved to convene a Temporary National Congress on July 1st of this year. This case was proposed by all members of the Standing Committee. According to the Party Constitution, the National Congress is held every two years. The Fourth National Congress was held on December 12, 1931, and the Fifth National Congress should be convened on November 12th of this year. However, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in December last year resolved to convene the National Political Conference on October 10th of this year and the National Assembly in 1935. If the National Assembly can be convened in advance, then there is no need to convene the National Political Conference again. According to the Outline of National Reconstruction, local self-government should be completed before the National Assembly is convened. There is now only a little over a year until the National Assembly is convened, and the government has a mountain of cases regarding the promotion of local self-government, but due to economic reasons, local self-government cannot be completed by 1935. Therefore, all members of the Central Standing Committee believe that it is better to convene the National Assembly in advance. Whether the National Political Conference should be convened as scheduled on October 10th of this year, or whether the National Assembly should be convened in advance this year, this matter must be decided by the National Congress. However, the legally prescribed time for the Fifth National Congress is after the National Political Conference. Therefore, today's Central Standing Committee resolved to convene a Temporary Congress on July 1st to decide whether the National Political Conference should be convened as scheduled, or whether the National Assembly should be convened in advance. Whether the Fifth National Congress still needs to be held, or whether it should be postponed, and whether the Central Committee members should be re-elected by the Temporary Congress or by the Fifth National Congress, will also be decided by the Temporary Congress. In addition, Li Liejun's proposal to make the government's power public will also be submitted to the Temporary Congress for discussion. As for whether the Central Committee needs to hold a plenary meeting before the Temporary Congress is convened, this matter was also mentioned at today's Standing Committee meeting, and it was generally believed that there was no need to convene it."

<h3>Dalai Sends Troops to Invade Batang; Batang Garrison is Prepared</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The representative of Xikang received a telegram from Dajianlu stating that the Dalai recently violated the peace treaty and sent troops to invade Batang. The military force is estimated to be two Daiben, combined with two mainland battalions, led by Zhengdong Galun. Because our garrison in Ba'an was prepared early, they did not succeed. They are currently patrolling along the Jinsha River. Whether there has been contact at the front is unknown. A telegram has been sent to Kangding to inquire, and a reply is expected within a day or two. According to Tibetan merchants, the Tibetan army plans to invade Qinghai at the end of the Tibetan calendar's second month, but whether they have already launched is unknown. We have built defensive works in Qinghai. (30th Telegram)</p>

<h3>Xiao Zhenying Discusses the Bloody Battle of Song's Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiao Zhenying, representative of Song Zheyuan, arrived in Beijing from Ping at 8:00 AM on the 30th. He will visit Chairman Chiang and the heads of various Yuan and ministries to report on the combat situation of the army, and will go to Shanghai to express his gratitude to all sectors of society. Xiao told reporters that on the day Song set out to take the oath, he said to the officers and soldiers, "Sacrificing for the survival of the country and the nation is a truly worthy death." All the soldiers were moved and indignant. On the way, they happened to encounter the Japanese invading Xifengkou. Our army suddenly encountered the battle and launched repeated assaults. Because there were no fortifications to cover them, none of them returned alive. Song then ordered Zhao and Dong's two brigades to attack the rear, encircling the enemy, killing countless enemies, and recapturing seven tanks, eighteen artillery pieces, and five armored vehicles. We recovered Xifengkou, and the enemy did not dare to advance again. The enemy then attacked Luowenyu. Our regimental commander, Li Cengzhi, had his leg broken by a bullet, but he continued to fight with his injuries, cutting the enemy into two pieces and seizing a great deal. Our army has now occupied the Banbishan area, and the soldiers at the front are all full of spirit. However, due to transportation difficulties, the wounded soldiers died on the way to the rear because the road was long and medical treatment was delayed. If there were a large number of heavy trucks, the difficulties could be reduced. From the army commander to the cooks, all of our soldiers have the heart to save the country and resist the enemy, and they are willing to make any sacrifice. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>There Will Be a Fierce Battle in Duolun; Feng Zhanhai's Troops Prepare to Charge</h3>

One part had reached the Longjiayingzi area south of Jingpeng, and the other had reached the Tianbaoshan area near Chuizishan, seeming to have an intention to attack. He ordered Yao Brigade, Feng Brigade, Zhao Brigade, and Guo Brigade to rush to the front to prepare to meet the attack, and personally led Deng Brigade and Zhao Regiment to move out, with the position under serious guard, resolved to lead our tens of thousands of brave soldiers to charge forward. There will be a fierce battle within days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

The total number of Japanese troops in the Chengde area is about 9,000, including Zhang Hai peng's forces. The Japanese recently built an airfield in Luanping County, near the Luanping County Public Security Bureau. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Officer of Sun Dianying's Troops Discusses the Enemy's Combat Methods</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A military officer of Sun Dianying's troops who came to Ping said that the enemy first uses planes to reconnoiter our position, and then drops a bomb each on the left and right wings of our position and flies away. When the enemy sees the bombs explode, they know how our position's troop strength is distributed, and then they begin to attack. First, they use armored cars to directly charge into our position, and then start shooting from our rear. Our hand grenades are very effective in destroying armored cars. Armored cars are dedicated to attacking on flat ground, enemy infantry are dedicated to attacking mountain tops, and enemy cavalry are dedicated to flanking maneuvers on both wings. They do not take any action until they reach our rear defense. Most of the cavalry are Mongols, wearing leather clothes. Our army's clothing is very thin. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>It is Said That Yu Zhishan's Puppet Troops are Planning to Revolt in Shenyang; A Batch of Japanese and Puppet Troops From Yuguan Left the Pass; It is Said That Cheng Guorui and Fang Yongchang Were Arrested</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to intelligence reports, the Japanese army has recently become extremely jealous of the puppet forces, and the puppet armies are mostly unable to withstand the enemy's oppression and are all thinking of waiting for an opportunity to revolt. Seeing that the situation is unstable, the enemy has already placed the puppet army leaders Fang Yongchang, Ding Qiang, and Cheng Guorui under surveillance. At the same time, Yu Zhishan, dissatisfied with the enemy, transferred his troops to the rear, planning to resolve them after the invasion of Rehe came to an end. Yu saw through the conspiracy and secretly ordered his troops to be on alert. A few days ago, taking advantage of the concentration of most of the troops in Rehe province, he suddenly revolted in Shenyang. He is now gathering his troops in a certain place, waiting for an opportunity to advance. Whether this is true remains to be verified. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Shoushan's puppet gendarmerie force was ordered by the Japanese to go from Andong to Rehe. The soldiers all scattered on the way. Li was arrested at Sujiatun Station on the South Manchuria Railway. The puppet Jianguo Army, Dingguo Army, and Anguo Army were all disbanded. Commanders Cheng Guorui and Fang Yongchang were arrested. The Jing'an Guerrilla Force, numbering over 3,000 men, revolted. A few days ago, they carried four cannons, six heavy machine guns, and fifty carts and set off from north of Shenyang city. On March 4th, Zhao Dianliang, commander of the Special Operations Detachment of the Righteous Army, led three men and blew up the water tower at the South Manchuria Railway Station. A Japanese lieutenant was wounded. The lieutenant fired his pistol wildly, killing three of his men, and then died himself. The Japanese side has been particularly alarmed since a strong bomb was discovered at Shenyang South Manchuria Railway Station. In the Battle of Xifengkou, the morale of the Japanese army was greatly diminished, and many took the opportunity to change into Chinese clothes and escape. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) A person from Jinzhou said that the puppet army commanded by Zhang Jinghui withdrew from Rehe and loaded seven trains in Beipiao, passing through Jin and arriving at Dahushan. Four trains were detained by the Japanese, and the officers and soldiers on board were disarmed. The Japanese army in Goubangzi is actively building fortifications, preparing for defense. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) There is a special change in the enemy situation in Yuguan. On the afternoon of the 29th, a train of troops left eastward. At 7:00 PM in the evening, more than 200 Japanese soldiers and more than ten cannons were withdrawn from Jiumenkou to Yuguan, waiting for trains to load and transport them out of the pass. At the same time, more than seventy carts traveled back and forth from the city to the station, transporting ammunition and supplies. The puppet troops from Yuguan also left the pass on more than ten carts and transferred to trains at Wanjiatun Station, heading east. The saying that Zhang and Yu's two rebel troops revolted is even more compelling. According to a continued report from the forward command, Zhang's rebel troops revolted in Jinzhou, and Yu's responded in Shenyang and occupied Shenyang. The situation in northern Manchuria is also serious, with rumors of a deterioration in relations between Japan and Russia. Commander Yao at the front telegraphed, saying that there is an opportunity not to be missed. This has been telegraphed to the Military Commission. Based on this judgment of the enemy's actions, it seems that they have other attempts, luring our troops in the Shihe River area to attack, and then taking advantage of the opportunity to seize Shimenzhai, cutting off our forward communication line, in order to quickly achieve the conspiracy to advance into Luandong. How exactly it will turn out remains to be further explored. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Eight-Province Suppression Plan; Guangdong and Guangxi Have Not Yet Complied</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Fork in the Road for National Revival or Ruin</h3>
<p>— Endurance</p>
<p>Beset by both internal troubles and external aggression, our nation today truly stands at a fork in the road between revival and ruin. Furthermore, at this fork, our nation can no longer afford to hesitate and observe. A clear and decisive attitude is urgently needed to determine which path to take.</p>
<p>What is meant by the fork in the road between revival and ruin? For the past century, our nation has been trapped in the sorrowful state of a semi-colony, unable to break free. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialism has used even more intense violence to arbitrarily invade, placing us on the brink of life and death. Today, the situation is increasingly urgent and precarious. Therefore, the pressing issue facing our nation is how to resist the aggression of violent Japan and how to safeguard the survival of our nation. All the people of the country are watching this issue with bated breath, waiting silently for a resolution.</p>
<p>How will we resolve this pressing issue today? Perhaps some still believe that, with the fall of Rehe, the Japanese aim of seizing the entire Northeast has been achieved. In the future, they might stop their advance, allowing us to temporarily demarcate the Great Wall as a border, close our doors, recuperate, and slowly plan for the future. This kind of thinking is a grave mistake. Regardless of whether the desires of Japanese imperialism will be satisfied with the acquisition of the Northeast, since the September 18th Incident, the people of the country have hoped that the government will make a firm stand. If the lost territory of the Northeast is not planned for recovery today, and our beautiful land is allowed to change its color permanently, it will not only fail to establish the government's prestige and give opponents an excuse but also easily lead the people of the whole country, under this strong stimulation, to either sink into despair or become agitated by anger. Even if the external troubles subside slightly, the phenomena arising from this despair or agitation will be enough to breed endless hidden worries for the nation's future. Moreover, if our nation continues to be so weak and incompetent and endures this for long, not only will violent Japan become even more arrogant and disregard us, but the world's powers will also despise our nation, and we will have no place in the international community. This is the path to death.</p>
<p>What is the alternative to this path? We must recognize the current situation of international politics and economics, recognize the precarious state of violent Japan's domestic affairs, and recognize our country's current position. At the same time, we must also recognize the great significance of our nation's revolutionary war, and with the greatest determination, fight to the death with Japanese imperialism for a long time, striving to recover lost territory and drive the armed forces of Japanese imperialism out of our territory. It is said, "Many difficulties can revive a nation," and "A nation without external enemies will perish." If our nation has not lost the spirit of safeguarding its national survival, then the current national crisis can be regarded as the driving force for the revival of our nation. The revival of Turkey is an example. Rebuilding our country and laying a new foundation for our nation lie in this. This is the path to rebirth.</p>
<p>The matter is urgent. Our nation stands at this fork in the road between revival and ruin today, with no time left to hesitate and observe. Will it take a big step and embark on the path of revival, or will it willingly sink into the dead end of destruction? Our country, from top to bottom, must make a clear decision at the crucial moment. At the crossroads, at the intersection, the life and death of the nation depend on this. Which way will it go?</p>
<h3>Sharp Escalation of Conflicts Between Sino-Eastern Railway Detention of Trains and Pseudo-Organizations with Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Ships Large Quantities of Military Supplies to Vladivostok; 3,000 Freight Cars Enter Siberia; Pseudo-Government Even Lodges Strong Protest</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Changchun, the "Manchukuo Government" today delivered a strongly worded note to the Sino-Eastern Railway Commissioner Li Shaogeng, addressed to the Soviet Deputy Commissioner, demanding that the Sino-Eastern Railway immediately cease driving freight cars into Russian territory. The note stated that the Soviet authorities had driven 3,000 freight cars from the Sino-Eastern Railway into the Siberian Railway and had not yet returned them. The "Manchukuo" authorities also strongly opposed the joint operation of the Sino-Eastern Railway and the Siberian Railway, an action that the former government of the Three Eastern Provinces had also opposed. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Daily News's Harbin dispatch, yesterday the "Manchukuo" border troops in Manchuria detained four trains heading to Siberia and unloaded the goods from one train coming eastward from Russia into Manchuria. The "Manchukuo" government has had a long-standing disagreement with the Sino-Eastern Railway Company. The "Manchukuo" authorities accuse Soviet Russia of arbitrarily using the Sino-Eastern Railway, which traverses Manchuria for five stations from Manchuria, and accuse Soviet Russia of transporting large quantities of military supplies through Manchuria to Vladivostok, as well as driving freight cars from the Sino-Eastern Railway into Russian territory without returning them. This action marks a sharp escalation of the conflict between the two sides. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet side has a plan to construct a railway via Manchuria for the Sino-Eastern Railway. A few days ago, the pseudo-Transportation Director Morita went to Harbin and pointed out the illegality of this action by the Soviet side and asked them to stop it. The Soviet side did not express any sincerity. The pseudo-Manchukuo side has decided that if the Soviet side continues this behavior in the future, it will take appropriate measures. On the 28th, Soviet employees, under cover of darkness, attempted to transport all the locomotives of the Sino-Eastern Railway into Russian territory in Manchuria. They were discovered by the pseudo-Manchukuo and immediately stopped. Therefore, the relationship between Russia and Manchuria, with the railway issue as its core, is in danger of gradually deteriorating. (30th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

(2) As for the Position and Responsibility of the Japanese Army: Taking advantage of this opportunity in the current situation, we will revive the spirit of Japan in the ideological aspect.

<h3>Collision of Fighter Planes During Training Flight; Accident Occurs</h3>

However, Lieutenant Commander Genda landed by parachute and was not injured. (30th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Mandated Island Issue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Daily Newspaper commented today on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the status of the Pacific mandated islands, stating that Germany, under no circumstances, wishes to conflict with Japan. After an open and friendly discussion, Japan's concerns can definitely be dispelled, and anti-German propaganda can also be terminated. At the same time, Germans must deny the claim that the mandated islands are genuine spoils of victory for the former enemies and insist that the League of Nations has the right to supervise the legal standing of the mandated territories. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the custody and governance of the islands in the Pacific have aroused various rumors in European countries. However, French public opinion, due to its constant vigilance against Germany, has developed a tendency to favor Japan. The Paris Daily Newspaper published an article today stating that, among the islands in the Pacific, at least the Caroline and Mariana Islands should not be within the jurisdiction of the League of Nations. This is because the Allied Powers before World War I used the guarantee of Japan's ownership as a condition for Japan's participation in World War I, which was long before the establishment of the League of Nations. Therefore, Germany today has only two paths to follow: one is to submit its opinion to the League of Nations, stating that since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the right to govern these islands has been terminated and should request the League of Nations to entrust another country to govern them; the other is that Germany can show generosity and allow Japan to continue to govern them. If so, it can gain some goodwill from Japan, and France also has every reason to want Germany to take the second path. (National News)</p>
<h3>Britain Only Provides Gunpowder to China and Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade, Mr. Runting, stated in the Lower House today that in the 18 months ending at the end of February this year, British gunpowder exports to China were worth £51,816, and to Japan, £299,000. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pirates Discovered Outside Newchwang; Four British Men Abducted from Taikoo Steamer; British Embassy Sends Personnel to Rescue</h3>
<p>Newchwang The Taikoo Company's "Nanchang" steamer was anchored outside Newchwang at noon today, waiting for a pilot, when several pirates arrived in three small boats and suddenly bombarded the ship. Then, 14 pirates boarded the ship. At that time, four crew members were chatting casually in the dining hall and were unexpectedly abducted into the small boats, heading northwest. The four abducted crew members were all British: Second Engineer Mr. Bailu, Third Engineer Mr. Pierce, and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Hargreaves. The latter two were lower-ranking crew members. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Newchwang The four crew members of the "Nanchang" were subdued by the pirates with pistols, tied up, and thrown into the small boats. Captain Rawlinson hurriedly entered the wireless room to send an alarm, but the wireless operator was not in the room. He then rushed back to his cabin to retrieve weapons, but by that time, the pirates had already carried the four crew members away. The pirates' small boats escaped through shallow waters, so steamships with deeper drafts could not follow. A British gunboat has now joined the search for the pirates' small boats. The British Vice-Consul in Shenyang, Mr. Clarke, who previously handled the cases of Bowles and Cochran's abduction, came to Newchwang after hearing the news. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Newchwang The hijacked "Nanchang" steamer has a displacement of 2,488 tons. At the time, two Chinese sailors were shot and wounded by the pirates because they did not quickly obey their orders. When the pirates fled, Captain Rawlinson tried to weigh anchor and chase them, but the pirates' boats entered a small river, and the "Nanchang" could not follow and could only watch them go. The Newchwang Taikoo Company's management office has reported this case. The "Manchukuo" defense forces, it is said, will do their best to rescue the abducted persons. According to a Reuters dispatch from Beiping, a British warship has been ordered to sail to Newchwang. It is now believed that this ship is the "Whitehall," which has a displacement of 1,040 tons. The British Embassy in Beiping stated that it is currently taking possible steps to rescue the abducted persons. It is now hoped that the "Manchukuo" water police can set up a tight net and restrict the movement of the pirates' boats so that they can be captured. The location of the robbery was at the mouth of the Liao River, 14 miles from Newchwang. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) British Consul-General Metcalfe formally visited the Japanese Consul this afternoon to request assistance in rescuing the four abducted British men and to discuss solutions. It is now believed that British Vice-Consul Clarke has also made the same request to the Japanese and Manchukuo military authorities in Newchwang. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>This Month's Government Expenses Paid at 70%</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) This month, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 70% of the regular government expenses, amounting to 2.95 million out of 4.2 million, except for military expenses, which have been slightly increased due to wartime circumstances. Various government agencies have already received their funds from the Ministry of Finance, and the remaining balance has also been issued checks, scheduled for clearance on the 31st.

<h3>All Agencies Should Comply with the National Government's Instructions on the Budget; Both the Political and Supervisory Branches</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued instructions to the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, stating that the budget is the fundamental law for managing national expenditures, and once it is promulgated, it should be strictly followed. However, since its promulgation, various revenue-collecting agencies have not fully reported and remitted their revenues to the national treasury but have freely used them for their own purposes, and have not transferred funds to the national treasury afterward. This has prevented funds included in the budget from being uniformly allocated, and has made it impossible for the national treasury to disburse funds to various government agencies according to the budget. The law has become a mere formality. This has even led to the inability to implement the announced reduction in government spending when national crises occur. Different government agencies have different methods, making it impossible to investigate. This is contrary to the central government's intention to reorganize finances. The year 1933 is about to begin, and it is necessary to thoroughly investigate each item based on the recent expenditure statements and the actual funds disbursed by the national treasury, and to conduct a review meeting with representatives from the Finance Committee of the Central Political Council to provide guidance. Urgent and redundant expenses should be reduced, salaries should be standardized, and expenses should be determined. The Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics should then be responsible for preparing the 1933 budget and submitting it for approval. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Various News from the Naval Department; Li Shijia's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Naval Department official Li Shijia talked about (1) The private sale of the Tianjin Naval Hospital. After the headquarters discovered it, it has been taken over by the French side.

Zeng has already departed from Hankou to Beijing, and after asking the department for instructions, he will go north.

(4) This summer, the naval academy will recruit students according to regulations, but it will have to be suspended due to insufficient funding. (5) It is rumored that the Japanese side will send a large number of warships to disrupt our country's ports, but the headquarters has not heard anything about it so far. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Will Not Enter Sichuan for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun said that since the ceasefire in Sichuan, there have been communist bandits causing disturbances again. The military leaders are now using all their strength to suppress the bandits, so they do not have time to immediately implement the plan to reorganize Sichuan's administration. Moreover, the central government is still considering the reorganization plan at length, so the timing of entering Sichuan is difficult to determine for the time being. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will return to Shanghai within days, and he will also return to Shanghai soon. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Educational Circles in Hebei and Tianjin Oppose the Sale of the Beiyang Hospital; Please Recover the Price from the Secret Seller and Hand It Over to the Educational Circles in Tianjin for Management</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Educational circles in Hebei and Tianjin oppose the sale of the Beiyang Hospital, and sent a telegram to Beijing, saying, "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan: We have learned that the land and buildings of the Tianjin Naval Medical School and Hospital belong to Hebei Province. Before 1915, the Zhili Medical School and Hospital were transferred to the Naval Department, and were called the Naval Medical School and Hospital. Until 1928, most of the expenses were still allocated by the provincial treasury. After 1928, the Naval Department stopped allocating expenses, and the school affairs were suspended. The hospital still勉自維持、惠濟地方貧民、冀津敎育界同人、方慶政府注重農工、醫校之設置、恢復舊觀有期、並冀此租界中一段國土、於庚子後與法方妥議、永遠作爲敎育慈善用地之協定、得以貫澈、海部旣無賡續此校之事實、早宜還諸地方、孰意近突被秘密價賣、當今革命政府、革命外交謀收回租界之不暇、豈容辦理敎育慈善之房地、秘賣異邦、重貽國羞、同人等聞耗之餘、萬分慨憤、爰共同集議、電請鈞院澈查私賣經過、公佈週知、藉慰羣情、並懇俯賜急令地方當局、制止交割、向秘賣人追繳賣價、迅速贖回、惟爲保持此段國土、永爲敎育慈善機關之用、擬請將該地交由天津敎育界、組織董事會負責管理、以免他虞、迫切陳辭、不勝待命之至、河北省立學校聯合會天津中等以上學校聯合會同叩艶、（三十日電）"</p>
<p>(The Hospital managed to maintain itself and benefited the local poor. The colleagues in the educational circles of Hebei and Tianjin are rejoicing that the government attaches importance to agriculture and industry, and that the establishment of medical schools has a chance to restore its old appearance. They also hope that this piece of land in the concession, which was negotiated with the French side after the庚子Incident, and the agreement to permanently use it as an educational and charitable land, can be fully implemented. Since the Naval Department has no plans to continue this school, it should be returned to the local government. Unexpectedly, it was recently secretly sold for a price. How can the current revolutionary government, with its revolutionary diplomacy seeking to recover concessions, allow the secret sale of land for education and charity to foreign countries, causing national shame? After hearing the news, colleagues were very indignant. They jointly decided to send a telegram to your esteemed Yuan, requesting a thorough investigation of the secret sale, public disclosure, to appease the public, and to urge the local authorities to stop the delivery, recover the selling price from the secret seller, and quickly redeem it. In order to maintain this piece of land and use it for educational and charitable purposes forever, it is proposed to hand over the land to the Tianjin educational circles and organize a board of directors to be responsible for management, so as to avoid other concerns. Pressing words, waiting for orders. Sincerely yours, Hebei Provincial School Federation, Tianjin Secondary and Above School Federation. (30th Telegraph))</p>

<h3>Hu Han's War Instigator Mitsumura Sentenced to One and a Half Years' Imprisonment with a Three-Year Reprieve</h3>
<p>Hualian, Tokyo, 30th Telegram: Japanese ronin Yoshizo Mitsumura, previously instigated by certain parties to create an excuse for launching troops and occupying Zhabei, colluded with party members to set fire to the factory of the Sanyou Industrial Company, leading to the January 28th Incident. Mitsumura, the chief culprit, was sentenced to one year and six months of penal servitude at the Tokyo Supreme Court at 11:00 AM today, with a three-year reprieve. In reality, it was merely a declaration of guilt without actual execution, which is equivalent to being innocent. The Japanese government's favorable treatment of criminals who disrupt diplomatic relations reveals its intentions.</p>

<h3>Concerns over the Rupture of Anglo-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Resolving the Detention of British Nationals; British Ambassador to Russia Recalled</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 30th Telegram: Sir Esmond Ovey, the British Ambassador to Moscow, has been ordered to return home and is scheduled to depart tonight. He will return here after consultations with members of the British government.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, London, 30th Telegram: The British Foreign Office confirmed today that it has recalled its ambassador to Russia, Sir Esmond Ovey, to immediately return home to discuss the case of the six Vickers engineers who were detained. However, it was stated that this move does not constitute a withdrawal of the British representative to Russia, nor does it signify a severance of diplomatic relations. Ovey will return to his post in the future.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 29th Telegram: The British Ambassador to Moscow met with Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov today regarding the arrest of employees of Vickers Company. It is claimed that the means of attempting to release the defendants and exempt them from trial were too crude. Foreign pressure may sometimes be applied to Mexico, but it will inevitably fail when applied to Soviet Russia. According to semi-official sources, the British Ambassador informed the Russian Foreign Minister that if the trial is not cancelled, the British government will take countermeasures, but did not specify what actions Britain would take. The Russian Foreign Minister replied that it has already been decided that the case will be tried soon, so it is futile for the British government to try to change this decision.</p>
<h3>Famine Rampant in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 29th Telegram: Ernest Kenworthy, former political secretary to Lloyd George, who conducted a walking tour of Soviet Russia and is en route back to England, has arrived in Berlin. According to him, a widespread famine is currently ravaging Soviet Russia, similar to the great famine of 1921. Millions have already died of starvation. There are cries throughout Soviet Russia of "We have no bread and will starve to death." It is reported that one million people have starved to death in the Kazakh-Kyrgyz region because of a lack of seeds and because most farmers are too weak to plow. Kenworthy believes that the cause of the famine is due to farmers resisting the government's collective farming system and the collapse of skilled labor and economic transportation. Kenworthy also stated that the arrest of six British engineers from the Vickers Electrical Company and the execution of thirty-five peasant leaders were measures to appease the people. Kenworthy has historically been sympathetic to Soviet Russia's experimental work and has been researching in Soviet Russia for six years. His sudden report on Soviet Russia is shocking.</p>

Next week, he will go to Geneva to attend the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 29th Telegram: Since the arrival here of Norman Davis, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, discussions have focused on war debts in relation to the World Economic Conference. British Ambassador to the U.S. Lindsay recently sent a report to London on the war debt issue, but its contents are kept secret by the Foreign Office. Parliament stated tonight that Roosevelt, given the attitude of the U.S. Congress, does not wish to propose a postponement of the war debts due. Therefore, it is generally hoped that a swift convening of the World Economic Conference may resolve the current difficulties.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 30th Telegram: Norman Davis, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, arrived at Paddington Station at 11:20 PM last night. Davis stated that his discussions with the British government did not concern the war debt issue and that the U.S. government hopes that the World Economic Conference will be held as soon as possible. Gibson, the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, also arrived in the evening and consulted with Davis.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 30th Telegram: This morning, Norman Davis, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street and met with Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM to discuss the work of the Disarmament Conference.

<h3>France Opposes the Four-Power Pact; Peng Gu Clearly Declares in the Chamber of Deputies that There is No Intention to Abandon the Little Entente and Poland</h3>
<p>▲Guomin, Paris, 29th Telegram: French Foreign Minister Peng Gu, during a discussion of international issues at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, clearly declared that France cannot accept the currently proposed form of Mussolini's Four-Power formula. He stated that Premier Daladier has no intention of abandoning the Little Entente countries and Poland in exchange for a dubious position in one of the Four-Power regimes. Peng Gu's statement is sufficient to indicate that the governments of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Poland have notified France of their opposition to the Italian plan. British Prime Minister MacDonald had also foreseen that the Four-Power plan would be rejected by the four smaller countries. The primary reason for the recent revival of the Little Entente is suspicion of Germany and Italy. If this suspicion cannot be dispelled, then it will be difficult for the countries to approve of the Italian plan.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th Telegram: Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Peng Gu have expressed their support for the methods of maintaining peace contained in Mussolini's Italian plan, but a concrete decision can only be made after detailed study. At today's cabinet meeting, all cabinet members expressed their approval of the Premier and Foreign Minister's views. It is reported that the French Ambassador to Italy, Suo Fonei, will personally return to Paris to report new information before the cabinet makes a firm decision.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th Telegram: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies convened this afternoon. Foreign Minister Peng Gu reported on the progress of the war debt issue, stating that it would be beneficial for France to reach a compromise with the United States. He also stated that the government would not express its views until it understands President Roosevelt's true intentions. As for the parliamentary discussion of this matter, it should be postponed because negotiations are underway. Peng Gu then presented Mussolini's plan for reading, stating that France has always prioritized the Covenant of the League of Nations and would not take any action outside the scope of the League of Nations. As for the rumors that Mussolini's plan involves the mandate of colonial territories, there is no basis for this. He then commented on British Prime Minister MacDonald's plan and finally stated that the recent events in Austria are of great significance. The government will pay close attention to the diplomatic aspects and hopes that the committee will not worry too much.</p>
<h3>Former French Government Aviation Superintendent Sentenced to One Year in Prison for Corruption</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 30th Telegram: The trial of Ra Fang, the former French government aviation superintendent, who was accused of fabricating official documents to frame others, concluded today. This case is of great importance and has attracted widespread attention from the public. Those who testified in court included Ban Le Wei, He Lileou, Tai Diou, and General Zhang Gande. As a result, it was found that Ra Fang did conspire with two others to forge documents, falsely accusing Shao Mi, the former civil aviation superintendent, and Weller, the general manager of the Rouen airport, of corruption. The court then sentenced Ra Fang to one year in prison. The second defendant, Gao Lin, admitted to forging 23 documents and was sentenced to two years in prison. The third defendant was sentenced to one year in prison.</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Nearly Meets With Disaster in America</h3>
<p>Boston - Two steel pipes were discovered on the tracks near the Back Bay Station here. The discovery occurred just minutes before the train carrying Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka was scheduled to pass through. It is believed to be a plot against Matsuoka. The mastermind behind the plot remains unknown as of late tonight. (National News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>▲Havas, Boston, 30th - Before the express train carrying former chief Japanese representative to the League of Nations, Yosuke Matsuoka, arrived here, police discovered two sections of water pipe on the tracks, wrapped in red and yellow cloth strips. It is generally believed that this was not an act of attempted murder, but merely a form of demonstration or intimidation, as the water pipes were very light. When a train passes over them, they would either be crushed or pushed off the tracks, with no danger of causing an accident. Four detectives are currently protecting Matsuoka's safety until he leaves here. When Matsuoka visited the Museum of Fine Arts to view Japanese art, police were stationed around the museum. Chinese areas were also patrolled by police, and anyone suspicious was arrested. Matsuoka took a train to New York at midnight, accompanied by two detectives for protection. No demonstrations occurred.</p>
<h3>Southwest Armies Supporting Resistance Against Japanese Aggression Concentrate in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangdong's Independent 4th Division Completed</p>
<p>Guangxi's 24th Division to Concentrate in Liuzhou for Reorganization by Deadline</p>

The division's organization is determined by the First Group Army headquarters and is divided into six sections: the Staff Section, the Adjutant Section, the Quartermaster Section, the Military Law Section, the Medical Section, and the Political Training Section. The division headquarters directly commands three regiments, each with three battalions, each battalion with three companies, plus an attached transport team, communication team, engineering team, photography team, propaganda team, and artillery battalion. The artillery battalion is organized into flat-trajectory gun, anti-aircraft gun, and mortar companies, totaling six regiments.

Chen Wen has been appointed as chief of staff, Deng Bohan as head of the adjutant section, and Liang Zicai as head of the medical section. The adjutant and medical sections are being organized first. The division's Second Regiment is being reorganized from the Second Battalion of the First Regiment of the Training Division, led by Pan Biao. These soldiers arrived in the province from the North River on the 22nd, led by Pan himself. The First and Third Regiments are being drawn from units stationed in the East River area for reorganization in the province, which is expected to be completed by around April 5th. The Guangxi province's army supporting the resistance against Japanese aggression has been agreed upon to be formed by drawing troops from the 44th and 45th divisions, together with the 24th Division, with the designation as the 24th Division, commanded by Qin Lianfang. The order has been issued to concentrate the drawn units in Liuzhou for reorganization. The 19th Route Army's Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu units from Fujian Province have already completed their organization and set out from western Fujian on the 19th of this month, estimated to arrive in Meixian and Dapu in the East River area in about 25 days. The 19th Route Army's office in Guangdong has negotiated with Chen Jitang to borrow temporary accommodation locations. The army is also purchasing military supplies and gas masks locally in Guangdong to facilitate military use. Cai Tingkai will also arrive in Guangdong soon to assume the position of commander-in-chief. It is reported that each of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces will appoint a deputy commander to assist in military operations against Japanese aggression. Generally, after the armies of the three provinces are concentrated in a certain location, they will hold a swearing-in ceremony and then depart. (March 24th)</p>
<h3>Guo Bingsheng Dies Heroically in Jiangxi Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>His Coffin Arrives in Nanchang, Greeted by Thousands</p>
<p>Chen Cheng Submits to Headquarters to Request Central Government Commendation</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Guo Bingsheng, the commander of the newly formed 37th Division, was originally a confidant of the bandit Peng Dehuai, serving as the commander of the Second Division in the pseudo-Third Army Corps. Last year, when Zhu, Mao, and Peng captured Yihuang, Wu Qiwai bypassed the southern part of Yihuang from Chongren and Le'an, cutting off the bandits' retreat route. Guo, recognizing that the Red bandits' burning and killing would not lead to a good end, abandoned darkness for light and resolutely led his entire pseudo-Second Division to defect, surrendering to Wu Qiwai. He was then ordered to reorganize into the newly formed 37th Division, stationed in Le'an, and worked exceptionally hard to suppress the bandits. In early this month, Commander Guo led his troops from Le'an to Dongpi, joining Wu Qiwai, Xiao Qian, and Li Yannian's units to encircle and suppress the pseudo-First Front Army, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000 people, gathered on the border of Yihuang and Le'an. From the 20th onwards, there was fierce fighting along the entire line in the Dongpi area, with mutual charges and hand-to-hand combat. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. In one of our army's divisions, three regimental commanders and one brigade commander were killed. Commander Guo, leading from the front, unfortunately died from a bullet wound. His body was found in Dongpi a few days ago and was carried to Yihuang by the Fourth Army headquarters for a proper burial. On the 29th, it was transported to the province. Representatives from the three provinces' headquarters, members of the provincial party headquarters, all members of the provincial government, and thousands of representatives from various circles greeted the coffin at the bus terminal. Guo's loyalty and bravery in suppressing the bandits deeply moved people. Commander Chen has submitted Guo's life story and the circumstances of his death to the three provinces' headquarters to request central government commendation and recognition to inspire and encourage. The province will also establish a funeral committee, hold a provincial funeral, and conduct a large-scale memorial service to comfort his loyal soul. (29th evening)</p>
<h3>Shandong's Abundant Aluminum Ore</h3>
<p>Aluminum is an Important Raw Material for Manufacturing Airplanes</p>
<p>Department of Industry Obtains Ministerial Order to Reserve for State Operation</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, the nation has been very enthusiastic about air defense construction, and the national campaign to purchase airplanes is flourishing. However, there has been little promotion of manufacturing our own airplanes due to the lack of talent and raw materials. Aluminum is a crucial raw material for manufacturing airplanes and military supplies. Few provinces have discovered this mineral. Shandong Province is unique in this discovery. The ore area is originally located near the Boshan and Zichuan area along the Jiaoji Railway line, which produces magnesite ore. The ore contains aluminum components. Japanese people have been buying a lot of it over the years, claiming that their country is prone to earthquakes and fire hazards, so they use this soil to make refractory bricks. However, it is questionable whether it is only used for making refractory bricks. Some of this magnesite is also sold to Shanghai. Although there are no statistics on annual exports, the quantity is definitely not small. The Department of Industry originally had regulations for the export of magnesite to manage it. Recently, the Ministry of Industry stated that aluminum is a raw material for manufacturing airplanes, so the sale of magnesite to foreigners should be strictly prohibited and reserved for state operation pending development. The Department of Industry was ordered to handle it. In addition to ordering the Boshan and Zichuan county governments to take note, the Department of Industry is also conducting a detailed survey of the mining area. It is reported that the mine stretches west along the Zhangbo branch line (Zhangdian to Boshan) of the Jiaoji Railway, from Tushan in the west 20 li of Boshan to the Jiaoji line in Zhangdian, spanning 40,000 meters east-west and 10,000 meters north-south, covering an area of 39,006.43 hectares. The ore reserves are extremely rich. The Department of Industry has also drawn detailed maps for reference, naming it "State-Operated Aluminum Mines in Heshan, Hucheng, Duposhan, etc. in Boshan and Zichuan Counties, Shandong." The Ministry of Industry's instruction to the Department of Industry is recorded as follows: "Upon investigation, the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mines received a report from the Geological Survey Institute regarding the discovery of aluminum ore in Zichuan and Boshan counties in your province. Officials were sent to investigate and reported that the aluminum ore reserves in the area were abundant. A report, along with ore samples and maps, was submitted to the ministry. The former Ministry of Agriculture and Mines also requested that the investigation of the aluminum ore situation be included in the administrative plan and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. Aluminum ore is the main raw material for manufacturing airplanes and equipment, and for refining steel and bricks. Its relationship to national defense is extremely important. However, the aluminum manufacturing industry is still under research in our country. According to Article 1 of the Mining Law and Article 11 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Law, the aluminum ore in the Zichuan and Boshan areas is designated as a national reserve area for future needs. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for record, three copies of the mine map are attached, ordering your department to instruct the respective county governments to make public announcements."</p>
<h3>Shantou Levies Unwarranted Tax on Domestic Bean Cakes, Causing a Stir</h3>
<p>The Tai Li Company Still Detains Goods and Extorts Taxes</p>
<p>Agricultural, Commercial, and Industrial Circles Unite in Opposition</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Chao-Mei agricultural fields rely entirely on domestic bean cakes for fertilizer. The value of bean cakes transported from various provinces to Shantou each year is about 20 million yuan. The businesses involved are the North-South Port Goods Transportation Association, the Grain Association, and the brokerage industry for sellers. The Tai Li Company, which has a contract to handle taxes on imported fertilizers in Shantou, coveted the large volume of imported bean cakes last year. They falsely reported to the provincial authorities that domestic bean cakes were imported goods and levied a tax of 80 cents per 100 catties. At that time, the business community united in opposition and sent representatives to the province to fight for their rights. During the dispute, all incoming and outgoing bean cakes were mostly detained by the Tai Li Company, causing great losses to the Chao-Mei rural areas. This spring, the Tai Li Company, taking advantage of the busy farming season and the peak sales of bean cakes, again claimed that bean cakes were imported goods and, together with the Seventh Branch Bureau, detained more than ten boats of bean cakes being transported inland. The chambers of commerce held repeated meetings, believing that the tax merchants intended to undermine the rural economy, destroy domestic goods, and were suspected of having international backing. They united various business representatives and, led by the municipal chamber of commerce, petitioned the Shantou Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau three times. The Municipal Government immediately dispatched the head of the Finance Section to the water police station, ordering the release of the goods. However, the district office, instructed by the tax merchant to detain the goods, disobeyed the orders of its superiors. The merchants then filed a complaint against the police station chief and the tax merchant for colluding, harming businesses, and endangering the people, citing five major crimes. The municipal chamber of commerce not only telegraphed the Finance Department to petition but also petitioned the municipal government to release the detained goods. The Municipal Government and the Party Headquarters, seeing the public's outrage, took the initiative to mediate, first releasing the detained goods and ordering the chamber of commerce to instruct the three associations to list the bean cakes stored in the city's warehouses by various merchants and report them, awaiting the Finance Department's order to resolve the issue. If taxes were required, the municipal chamber of commerce should endorse and guarantee them. After this method was decided, more than ten boats of bean cakes detained on the sea were released on the 19th. On the 20th, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters again summoned the representatives of the three associations, Cai Shifan, Lin Weidang, and Tang Boyan, to the Municipal Government to hold a discussion meeting to discuss fundamental solutions. At the same time, various merchants also reported the quantity of bean cakes stored in the city to the Municipal Government, totaling 871,905 pieces. It is heard that if taxes were levied according to imported goods, at 56 cents per dan, each piece would have to bear a tax of 22 cents, totaling more than 200,000 yuan, which the Tai Li Company coveted greatly. Currently, Chao-Shan merchants and agricultural and industrial groups in various counties are all telegraphing the province to oppose it. Although the tax revenue directly comes from merchants and civilians, the indirect burden falls on the shoulders of farmers, affecting the production capacity of farmland and exploiting the masses who eat rice, so it has gradually become a serious problem.

<p>The Provincial Government, in accordance with the Administrative Supervisory Commissioner Ordinance issued by the Central Government, resolved to divide the province into thirteen districts, each with one supervisory commissioner. This county is the fourth district, with an administrative supervisory commissioner. Quan Tiqian has been appointed as the commissioner, concurrently serving as the magistrate of Songjiang County.

<h3>Provincial Committee Inspects the Local Militia</h3>
<p>Sun Shaojiang, the examination commissioner of the Provincial Committee for the Local Militia, arrived at the public sports field with County Magistrate Shen Yong at 9:00 AM today (30th) to inspect the training results of the local militia from the first, second, and third districts. The members of each district militia lined up, and the commissioner called their names according to the roster, and then began to inspect the various training routines. The ranks were neat and the steps were uniform. Then, they performed national martial arts. About 200 members of the militia were inspected. Finally, Commissioner Sun and Magistrate Shen gave speeches, encouraging them to serve their hometowns and protect the local area. They were satisfied with the inspection. It ended at 12:30 PM. In the afternoon, Commissioner Sun and Magistrate Shen hired a boat to go to Chengxie, Shanyang, and other places to inspect the training results of the local militia in those districts. They will return to Songjiang in about one or two days.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Reactionary Prisoner Dies After Jumping Off Train</h3>
<p>Yan Guishan, the special service chief of the third company of the Zhenjiang Security Team, escorted three reactionary prisoners, Bai Xiulan, Bai Kezhong, and Feng Qingyun, to Wuxi for detention the other day. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived near Qishuyan, Bai Kezhong pretended to go to the toilet and immediately jumped off the train to escape. Because he was shackled, he fell to his death immediately. Chief Yan escorted the remaining prisoners to the local county government and then took a car to bring the body back to Wuxi. Yesterday, he reported to the county court. After Inspector Du went to examine the body, Yan Guishan prepared a coffin for burial. It is also heard that the three prisoners were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the Jiangsu Provisional Military Law Assembly.</p>
<h3>High Court President Visits Wuxi for Inspection</h3>
<p>Lin Biao, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, personally visited various places to inspect county prisons in order to rectify them. Yesterday (30th) at around 11:00 AM, he arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou on an express train going upstream. After getting off the train, he went directly to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Chen. Accompanied by Mr. Chen, he inspected the county prison and the county prison branch. Mr. Lin inquired in detail about the facilities inside the prison and the treatment of prisoners. He then went to the county court, where he was received by President Xu and Chief Zhou, and inspected the interior before leaving. It is heard that Lin is scheduled to leave Wuxi today to inspect Changzhou.</p>
<h3>Funding Issue for County Militia</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Militia was ordered to be established last year, and seventeen district militias have been established throughout the county. The chiefs of the militia and the heads of the jia have been selected separately. However, due to the lack of designated funds for militia expenses, they are all struggling to make ends meet, merely existing in name. The district chiefs, feeling the difficulty in handling affairs, jointly resolved in a meeting to submit a request to the Provincial Militia Council: (1) Please order the county magistrate, who also serves as the chief commander, to allocate regular expenses for each district headquarters for office use. All monthly donations collected by each district without authorization should be stopped to protect the people's livelihood. (2) Please instruct the chief commander to convene meetings of the district chiefs on a regular basis to ensure contact and open communication when things happen. The above two points have been approved by the Provincial Militia Council and instructed the county government to verify and approve the expenses and issue them on a regular basis, ensuring effective management.</p>
<h3>More Than a Dozen Bandits Rob at Night</h3>
<p>The home of Hui Guonan, a villager in Huijiaqiao Township, the third district of the county, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits in the middle of the night the other night. They opened the back door, intending to rob, and tied the gates of all households in the village with lead wire in advance to prevent them from opening the doors to rescue. Hui heard the alarm and quickly told his family to hide. He secretly took out his self-defense firearms and the police gong and fired live ammunition at the bandits. The bandits, knowing that he was prepared, fled in a hurry. However, several bandits were still lurking on the roof, intending to try again. They were also scared away by Hui's gunfire, leaving behind lead wire, hemp rope, and other items, which have been reported to the county government for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Mutinous Troops in Lvsi Disbanded</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Security Guerrilla Team stationed in Lvsi mutinied and went to sea. After being pursued by the provincial security regiment, they fled north to Yanzao. At Caohekou, they were blocked and disarmed by the Maritime Public Security Huaihai Guerrilla Team. The team leader, Li Zhenji, telegraphed the Nantong District Headquarters and forwarded the request to the provincial government for instructions. They were ordered to give them money on the spot and send them back to their hometowns. More than 110 firearms were seized and sent to the Provincial Security Office.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Preparations for the Xingyang Highway to Begin Construction</h3>
<p>The Xingyang section (Taixing to Yangzhou) of the highway has not yet started construction since the provincial order to build it. The county government received another provincial order yesterday, instructing it to speed up construction during the slack farming season and complete it within one month. County Magistrate Ma, after receiving the order, instructed the technical director, Li Ying, to actively prepare in order to see its completion as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Taixian: Local Militia Grand Drill</h3>
<p>This county's autonomous region is planned to have fifteen districts, and the militia is established according to the districts. The first session has 150 members per district. On the 25th of this month, a grand drill was held at the Dajiao field in the west city. Commissioner Qiu was sent by the provincial government to Taixian for inspection. Although it was drizzling that day, the spirit of the militia members was not diminished at all. It is heard that in addition to testing skills, military common sense will also be tested. Various agencies have also prepared many kinds of prizes to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Rampant Banditry in Zhangguandu</h3>
<p>The home of Zhang Fubao, a farmer in Zhangguandu Village, the eleventh district, was robbed by bandits last month, and after the abduction of a hostage, bandits often came to the village to cause trouble. The local farmers immediately reported to the county government for approval to send police to be stationed. Unexpectedly, the bandits were not afraid at all and raided with weapons under the heavy rain the other night. Fortunately, the stationed police sentries noticed it and fired warning shots. The bandits also returned fire for about an hour before they were defeated and retreated. Because it was dark, the police team did not pursue deeply.</p>
<h3>Luhe: Grain Clerk Arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Gu Yanbin, the clerk in charge of reed tax collection in this county, has been repeatedly accused of overcharging grain and embezzling public funds. There are many accumulated cases. He has now been ordered by the provincial government to be thoroughly investigated and punished by the county government. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen personally ordered Shen Zhanba, the director of the Finance Bureau, the other day, to inspect and verify the registers of reed tax collection and various items handled by the clerk. Finding that there was indeed suspicion of embezzlement, the clerk was taken into custody for interrogation according to law.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Talks About the Trip to the Northern Frontlines to Comfort Troops</p>
<p>And Says He is Willing to Take on Anti-Japanese Work</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Will Come to Shanghai in a Day or Two</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy for the inspection of European and American industries, returned to the country from Europe and immediately went to Nanjing to report to the Central Government on the inspection. He then went north to Peiping and Tianjin, and to Xifengkou to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers of Song Zheyuan and others. He then went to Baoding to meet with Jiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. He returned south the other day and returned to Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. His wife, Ms. Soong Ailing, also came with him. According to Kong yesterday morning to our reporter, Chairman Jiang will come to Shanghai in a day or two. Today, he may not have time to come here due to other important official business in Nanjing. Please ask various parties to appoint Jiang as commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force. Kong's intention is that under today's current situation, for the sake of unifying military power and facilitating command, it is necessary to set up a commander-in-chief. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Inspection of Xifengkou</h3>
<p>Kong first said, "During this trip north to meet Chairman Jiang, I made a special trip to the front lines of Xifengkou to inspect and comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers of Song Zheyuan and others. I repeatedly met with Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and other generals. Our army's defensive fortifications are extremely solid, and the morale is particularly high. As for food and machinery, the Central Government is providing as much assistance as possible, so there is no need to worry about shortages. The military situation at Xifengkou is now in a stalemate. Song Zheyuan and others are fighting bravely against the enemy and have made great contributions. Our side has also suffered very heavy casualties. After inspecting Xifengkou, I originally intended to go to the front lines in the Gubeikou area to comfort them, but due to lack of time, I returned to Peiping in a hurry."</p>
<h3>Japanese Easing of Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Kong continued, "The Japanese are bound to spread various rumors after each military operation, trying to ease the atmosphere. In reality, it is completely a kind of enticement. Their ambition to gain an inch and seek a foot has never changed. They will surely restore their ferocious face one day and plan another large-scale invasion. There is no doubt about this. The Central Government has made strict preparations for the military affairs in North China, vowing to fight the enemy to the end. Rumors of compromise and direct negotiations are absolutely unfounded. In today's situation, to compromise with Japan is either to be insane or to have no conscience."</p>
<h3>Chairman Jiang's Visit to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong added, "After returning to Nanjing, I met with Chairman Jiang many times. I heard that he will come to Shanghai in a day or two, or go to Zhejiang before going north to take charge. However, today, he may not have time to come here due to other important official business in Nanjing. It is still undecided whether he will take a train or a plane. As for Zhang Xueliang in Shanghai, I heard that he has been suffering from a minor illness recently. I intend to visit him immediately."</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Issue</h3>
<p>The reporter immediately asked whether the requests from various circles to the government to appoint Chairman Jiang as commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force could be realized. Kong replied, "I have not been back to the country for long and do not know the details of this case. However, from a personal point of view, under today's circumstances, for the sake of unifying military power and facilitating command, it is indeed necessary to set up a commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force."</p>
<h3>Taking on Anti-Japanese Work</h3>
<p>Kong also said, "I am currently organizing the results of my inspection in Europe and America, and I will publish them all in the future." When the reporter asked whether he would continue to be in charge of the work of revitalizing industry and commerce, he replied, "Today, the country's situation is critical, and it is urgent to revitalize industry. I am very willing to take on the anti-Japanese work and fulfill the responsibility of a citizen to save the country."</p>
<h3>Criticizes the Dictatorial System</h3>
<p>Finally, regarding the dictatorial system, the reporter asked whether China today is suitable for the dictatorial system, as Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy have used the dictatorial system to revive their countries. Kong said, "China's problem today is not a matter of system, but a matter of people. The dictatorial system is good, but who can implement dictatorship? There are many different opinions, and government orders are inconsistent. The discussion of a matter is flourishing, but very little is seen in reality. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will unite and work hard to resist foreign aggression, otherwise the country will be destroyed soon. What system can we talk about then?" Kong said with great emotion.</p>
<h3>Results of the Re-inspection of Inferior Goods by Merchants on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association planned to re-inspect the shops on Nanjing Road yesterday morning to see if there were any activities of inferior goods. Therefore, the two associations sent committee members Wang Kai and Wang Lianfang, and industry specialists Zhou Peiquan, Xu Zixiang, and Xia Zuosheng, to check the silk and satin, wool fabrics, and foreign cloth industries; and committee members Sun Wenyi, Ling Ziguang, Zhao Weiwen, and Wang Zhixuan, and industry specialists Tao Zhiqian, Hu Pengnian, and Wu Shaofu, to check the foreign goods, southern goods, clocks and watches, electrical materials, photography, and department store industries. They started at 10:00 AM and did not complete the detailed inspection until 7:00 PM. After returning to the association, each group reported that there were no traces of inferior goods in general. However, a few temporary and soon-to-be-closed foreign goods stores were found to be selling inferior goods in mixed sales. They were persuaded, or their conscience was still there, and they agreed to clear them out in a few days. One store claimed that it was selling off inventory by auction and there was nothing they could do. After discussion, it was decided that the association would first send a formal letter of warning, setting a deadline to seal up and stop selling. If there was no effective reply, the scandal would be published in the newspaper and a request would be made to the executive committee to find a way to prevent the auction-style temporary stores that sell inferior goods in mixed sales from renting houses for business on Nanjing Road in the future. The detailed results will be officially announced after the table is made.</p>

<h3>The Chinese People, Aware of the Past Incidents in the Northeast, Cannot Disregard the Political Situation in the New Northwest Province and the Conflicts Between Hui and Han</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society reports: Recently, rumors of unrest in the Northwest have been rampant. However, these are all reports from foreign news outlets, making it difficult to ascertain the truth. Recently, an individual from Hunan involved in transportation in the Northwest spoke to a reporter from the New Sound Society, providing a detailed account of the political situation in the new province, the causes of the unrest, and the covetousness of foreigners towards the area. The information is recorded below in separate sections:</p>
<p>Overview of the Political Situation: After Yang Zengxin's assassination in the new province, he was succeeded by Jin Shuren. Jin, a native of Didao County, Gansu, has largely followed the established practices since taking office, continuing Yang's old policies. As a result, there has been no progress in any area of the new province. Transportation, construction, education, and other areas are more backward than other provinces in the interior. Only the financial situation is more prosperous than other provinces. The local customs and traditions are very unsophisticated, and the rulers are largely unaware of the need for enlightenment. Furthermore, the policy of keeping the people ignorant, left over from Yang Zengxin's time as governor, is the primary reason for the lack of sophistication among the province's residents. Class inequality is as it was before the founding of the Republic. For example, people still use the term "Great Lord" when addressing officials. When people meet with officials, they must kowtow and worship, and they dare not raise their heads to speak without being pardoned. In addition, every official who takes office, such as the county magistrate or the intendant, must declare the severity of the criminal law to instill fear in the people. Even more extreme, when county magistrates and intendents are transferred, they even bring photos of the brutal punishments they inflicted during their tenure and publicly display them upon arrival to intimidate the people. Furthermore, the people's livelihoods are very simple, and the economic situation is quite prosperous, so there are no beggars anywhere in the province.</p>
<p>Estrangement Between Hui and Han: The Hui and Han people of the Northwest have historically been incompatible. The rulers have failed to find ways to reconcile their feelings, leading to frequent conflicts. Small sparks quickly ignite into raging fires. In the Shaanxi area, it is common to hear tragic reports of self-slaughter between the Hui and Han people, with endless cycles of revenge. In recent years, conflicts have also occurred from time to time in the new province, but none have been as tragic as those in Shaanxi and Gansu. Since Jin took office, the power of the Hui people in the province has declined. The authorities, aiming to prevent a recurrence of the Hui rebellion in the new province, have implemented increasingly strict suppression, unaware that this policy is exacerbating the animosity between the Hui and Han people. The Hui people may tolerate it for a time, but eventually, there will be a reaction. Therefore, suppressing one ethnic group is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, Jin, being from Didao County, Gansu, knows that the people of that county have suffered greatly from oppression by the local Hui people. As a result, many people from Didao who come to the new province seek revenge. At the same time, Jin's strong regionalism has led to many people from Didao who travel to the new province engaging in improper conduct, even defrauding Han people of the same ethnicity. As a result, the general population has a very negative feeling towards Jin.</p>
<p>Causes of the Unrest: The factors mentioned above are the remote causes of the current disturbances. The immediate cause is the authorities of Hami County seeking to abolish the three Hui Jassaks (the term for "three"), i.e. the San Jassaks. The Hami San Jassaks were conferred by the Qing Dynasty and have not been abolished to this day. Their power is greater than that of Jassaks in other areas, so the general Hui people worship them. Since the founding of the Republic, their power has been separate from that of the county magistrate, and most of the land taxes and other levies go to the Jassaks. Last spring, in order to place his fellow Didao villagers from Hami into positions and to address these economic issues, the magistrate of Hami County ordered the abolition of the Jassaks, which led to opposition from the local Hui people and caused unrest. Initially, the Hui people of the area even sent a telegram to Chairman Jin to petition him, but the telegram was intercepted by the county authorities. The Hui people suspected that the authorities were refusing their request, so they rose up in resistance. The county authorities also telegraphed Dihua for help. Chairman Jin then sent a large army to Hami. The Hui people had already expressed regret and many were willing to surrender, but the authorities refused to accept. As a result, the Hui people rose up again in stubborn resistance. After the outbreak of the unrest, Jin's troops were repeatedly defeated by the Hui people, even though the number of people on both sides differed greatly. The Hui people are inherently very strong and possess locally made rifles with poisonous wood bullets. Being shot by one meant certain death and was quick and easy to manufacture. Thus, the unrest continued for nearly a year before being quelled. However, most of the strong Hui people fled into the mountains and dispersed in all directions, where they were waiting for an opportunity to regain their strength. Chairman Jin's report this spring concerned this account.</p>
<p>Gradual Spread: Since the unrest in Hami subsided, many of the remaining insurgents have fled to the areas surrounding the new province. As a result, small towns and cities frequently experience disturbances caused by minor incidents, and even large cities are unstable. Although recent details are unavailable due to having been away from the new province for a long time, it is likely that these things will also occur.</p>
<p>Urgent Attention Required: This incident must not be ignored and should be resolved as soon as possible to avoid exploitation by foreigners. Sending a large army to suppress the rebellion is not a fundamental solution and would not be acceptable to the authorities of the new province. The political figures in the province have very strong anti-foreign (not referring to non-Chinese people) sentiments, fearing that others will seek to usurp their power. Therefore, the party affairs guidance specialists, Chu Minyi and Wang Zengshan, sent by the Central Government in 1918 were rejected by the local authorities. This is not a matter of individuals wanting to go to the Northwest, nor is it a matter of obtaining prior approval from the authorities. Therefore, reconciliation is also impossible. However, we must not forget this as a result.</p>
<p>Foreign Covetousness: The abundance of resources in the province is well known to the Chinese people. However, our country has not developed them ourselves, which has attracted the covetousness of foreigners. Recently, in addition to the covert competition between Britain and Russia, the Japanese are also eager to intervene. However, in reality, the power of the Russians is the greatest. In addition to secretly inciting the Hui people, Russia is also conducting open propaganda on the border. There are several Hui-language newspapers run by Russians who have recently hired new people in the Tashkent area. The most influential of these is the "Liberation" newspaper, with the English name (Autulus), which is specifically for propaganda aimed at Chinese people. The language used is very simple, intending to make it easy for the Hui people to understand. As a result, many ignorant Hui people are being fooled by them. Some, unable to move freely and subjected to oppression, have even left China and joined Russia. At the same time, since the completion of the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, the new border has been threatened. If the authorities do not find ways to improve the situation, I am afraid that Xinjiang will no longer be ours. The power of the British is smaller, but they are particularly keen on winning over the Mongolian people of the province to oppose Russia. The Japanese have not yet been able to intervene, but they are also eager to try. It is said that the Islamic Research Association, established by the Inukai Cabinet two years ago, has recently emerged with considerable influence. According to photos and texts published in the Hui-language "Liberation" newspaper, the Japanese even sent new Japanese converts to Islam to Mecca via Xinjiang last year to conduct research. The Japanese view this as the beginning of their intervention in the Northwest. The urgency of the situation should not be ignored by our people. Have our people paid attention to it?</p>
<h3>German Boycott of Jews Unlikely to Affect Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that since the National Socialist Party of Germany launched the movement to boycott Jews, both German and Jewish leaders in the city assured reporters today (March 30th) that the conflict is purely an internal German issue and will not affect Shanghai. It is unlikely that propaganda to boycott Jews will occur among the German expatriate community in the city. The Jewish expatriate community in Shanghai has neither considered retaliatory measures nor wants to engage in any public movement or propaganda to protest.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy ArYoshizawa's Diplomatic Opinions on China Before Returning Home Reveals a Glimpse of the Japanese Mentality and Can Serve as a Reference for Our Government</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that before leaving Shanghai to return home for discussions, Yoshizawa Kenkichi, the Japanese ambassador to China, drafted a four-chapter diplomatic memorandum on China for future reference. The Datong News Agency reporter obtained the memorandum from Japanese diplomatic circles yesterday and translated the key points as follows:</p>
<p>Abandon Direct Negotiations (Reason): The reason why our country (Yoshizawa refers to himself) "hereinafter referred to as" has always insisted on direct Sino-Japanese negotiations is to avoid unwarranted interference from the League of Nations and to prevent the Chinese government from submitting the matter to the League of Nations for adjudication. Now that our country has withdrawn from the League of Nations, this strong stance is enough to deal a major blow to the League of Nations. The eyes of the world have also shifted considerably. Moreover, the League of Nations has no right to interfere in future diplomacy with China, even if the Chinese government wants to submit the Manchurian issue to the League of Nations for resolution, it will not be a problem at all because our country has withdrawn from the League of Nations. From this point of view, the issue of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations is no longer applicable to the current environment. If our country still insists on the previous proposal, it will not only invisibly increase China's international status but also further demonstrate the weakness of our diplomatic methods. Therefore, in the future, our government should find new ways to negotiate with China.</p>
<p>Consolidate the Foundation of the Northeast (Reason): At present, although the foundation of "Manchukuo" is expanding daily, its administration has not yet been put on track. Our authorities should continue to provide practical assistance in all areas, with consolidating the foundation and leading the administration being the most important. The reason why countries around the world do not recognize "Manchukuo" is because the foundation of "Manchukuo" has not been consolidated and all political and administrative affairs have not been put on the right track. Now we should seize on this shortcoming and do it diligently to ensure that the foundation of "Manchukuo" becomes more and more solid and the politics become more and more transparent, so that countries have no excuse. Recognition is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Maintain a Cool Stance Towards China for the Time Being (Reason): Since the Northeast Incident, the Chinese National Government has felt unusually distressed both internally and externally. Although the military leaders of various provinces have temporarily suspended the civil war due to external tensions, the undercurrents are still surging. However, they are all limited by the evaluation of the Chinese people and dare not be the first to take up arms. Our military action against China should be temporarily suspended now that Rehe has been obtained. We should only defend and not attack, thereby easing the attitude of the military leaders of the various provinces of China towards us. Then internal struggles will inevitably break out again. At that time, if we seize the opportunity to advance again, all the problems that cannot be solved at present will inevitably be solved easily. In this way, not only can our loyal and brave soldiers avoid many sacrifices, but also it will be easier to deal with countries around the world.</p>
<p>Employ Political Maneuvering (Reason): Looking at the above, it is undoubtedly clear that future diplomacy with China should not rely solely on military force but should urgently employ political maneuvering. Many in the current Chinese authorities advocate resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute with a peaceful attitude. However, because our country's military actions have not stopped and because of the lack of understanding of the people, they ultimately do not dare to propose this proposal to us rashly. If our government can transform military diplomacy into political diplomacy, then future victory can be assured. Otherwise, the Chinese authorities will use the words "Resist Japan" to rally the people, and if they fight us to the last ditch, our country may not be confident of winning victory and returning home.</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Kenkichi's diplomatic memorandum on China was unanimously approved by the Japanese military and political authorities stationed in Shanghai. Therefore, at the end of the memorandum, there are also signatures of many important Japanese personnel. According to sources at the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has held discussions with Yoshizawa and is likely to adopt his views.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Steamer Nanchang Robbed in Newchwang, Four Foreign Crew Members Kidnapped, Many Injured, Cargo Undamaged</h3>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's merchant steamer Nanchang, departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th of this month with a small cargo and no valuable goods, bound for Newchwang. On the morning of the 29th, at 12:00 AM, while anchored outside Newchwang awaiting a pilot, it was robbed by pirates. Foreign crew members were kidnapped and many were injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Anchored and Encountered Pirates: The Taikoo Company's general cargo (popularly known as "wild chicken") merchant steamer Nanchang, with a displacement of 2,500 tons, owned by the British national Robinson and managed by the Chaozhouese compradore Lin Yansong, departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th of this month, fully loaded with flour and sundry goods, bound for Newchwang. At 12:00 AM on the morning of the 29th, it arrived and anchored outside Newchwang, waiting for a pilot to board and guide it into the harbor. Suddenly, fourteen pirates were discovered aboard three civilian boats, each armed with guns. They first fired shots at the Nanchang as a show of force, and then boarded the ship, speaking with a northern accent.</p>
<p>Firing Shots and Kidnapping: After boarding, the pirates immediately monitored the captain and the radio operator, preventing them from taking action. At the time, four foreign crew members, including Second Engineer Bai Lu, Third Engineer Pei Erqi, and junior crew members Johnson and Hagarlev, were chatting in the main dining room. In the chaos, the pirates who boarded the ship mistook them for passengers, pressed them with pistols, and attempted to kidnap them. When other crew members saw this, they attempted to resist. The pirates opened fire, wounding many Chinese crew members on the spot. The pirates then kidnapped the four foreign crew members, tied their hands and feet, and boarded the civilian boats parked alongside, heading northwest.</p>
<p>Sending an Alarm for Help: After being informed, Captain Robinson ran back to his cabin, retrieved firearms, and attempted to resist. However, when he arrived at the main dining room, the pirates had already taken the four men away on the civilian boats. He immediately sent a radio message to the Newchwang puppet state water patrol and the Japanese navy for assistance. At the same time, he provided medical assistance to the injured Chinese crew members. Fortunately, the injuries were minor and not life-threatening. An inspection of passengers and cargo revealed that nothing had been lost.</p>
<p>Puppet Warships Search: After receiving the radio report, the Newchwang puppet Manchukuo military and police immediately dispatched patrol ships to provide assistance. By the time they arrived, the pirates had already escaped. Because the pirate boats had a very shallow draft, they escaped into shallow water, and the patrol ships were unable to pursue them. The British gunboat stationed on the Newchwang river surface joined the search for the pirate civilian boats after receiving the alert, but ultimately they were not found.</p>
<p>Efforts to Rescue: After receiving the report, the Taikoo Company in Shanghai, learned that four foreign crew members had been kidnapped and many Chinese crew members had been shot and wounded. Fortunately, the passengers and cargo had not been lost. They immediately telegraphed the British Consul in Shenyang to strictly apprehend the pirates. After hearing the alert, the British Vice-Consul in Shenyang, Clark, went to Newchwang to discuss rescue measures with the puppet Manchukuo military and police.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Liao Case Today</h3>
<p>He Xiangning Suffers Relapse Due to Agitation</p>
<p>Central Government Leaders All Promise to Find Ways to Rescue Him</p>
<p>Civil Rights Protection League Issues Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>Liao Chengzhi, son of the late revolutionary Liao Zhongkai, was arrested on the 26th in the Five Blessings Lane (Wufunong) of the International Settlement and detained in the police station. The preliminary hearing was held at the Higher Second Branch Court the day before yesterday. As a result, the police lawyer opposed the transfer and he was ordered to be remanded in custody for further investigation. Madam He Xiangning, the Central Committee member and mother of Liao,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>suffered a relapse of her old heart ailment due to her distress at her son's unjust treatment. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency paid a special visit to Madam He at her residence yesterday. The record of her conversation and the replies received from various parties are as follows:</p>
<p>Relapse of Liao's Mother's Old Ailment. The reporter visited Madam He Xiangning, Liao's mother, yesterday. After presenting the calling card, he was invited upstairs. Madam He was reclining in a rattan chair, her face filled with sorrow. Ms. Zhang, her friend, received the reporter and invited him to sit down. According to Ms. Zhang, Madam He Xiangning had suffered from heart disease for ten years. During the January 28th Incident last year, when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, she organized a rescue team and rushed to rescue wounded soldiers, which caused a relapse. After treatment, she had recovered somewhat and had recently been able to paint. Now, suddenly faced with this unexpected event, she is extremely saddened by the unjust treatment of Mr. Chengzhi, causing a relapse of her old ailment.</p>
<p>Speaking with Difficulty Amidst Illness. Madam He Xiangning stood up with difficulty, her face filled with sorrow, and spoke briefly with the reporter. Since the incident occurred, in addition to sending telegrams to the central government requesting the appointment of a lawyer for defense, I also inquired with the Municipal Public Security Bureau about the true situation. Director Wen then sent Captain Hong of the police brigade to visit last night (the night before last) at around 9 o'clock. According to him, the Municipal Public Security Bureau had no prior knowledge of this case and had no intention of actively arresting Mr. Liao. After investigation, there is no evidence whatsoever, so there is no need to worry about any unforeseen danger. As for the police saying that they found documents on Chengzhi, that is even more absurd. These notes are receipts for loans received by his friends. I remember that Chengzhi had asked me to find a way to lend money to a friend in need. I greatly approved of his chivalrous spirit of helping those in need, so I ordered him to find a way to help his distressed friend. Now, the police have found the loan receipts from his friend and claim they are evidence, which is simply to condemn people. In the future, anyone carrying notes will be suspected of committing a crime, which is terrifying. Chengzhi went to Five Blessings Lane this time because he wanted to comfort the soldiers at the front line. He had asked for my permission beforehand. Because I feared that the soldiers at the front line lacked tea, I ordered him to purchase tea as a comfort item for the sake of practicality. My son has been unjustly treated without any evidence. I have decided to ask the acting lawyer, Wu Kaisheng, to demand his unconditional release at the hearing tomorrow (today), or to transfer him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. As for the report in today's newspaper that I said I would leave it to fate, my son is definitely not a Communist, so there is no need to leave it to fate. I think it was a mistake by the reporter. Please (addressing the reporter) correct it to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Replies from Central Government Leaders. The replies received by Madam He Xiangning yesterday from various central government leaders all indicated their willingness to find ways to rescue him. Wang Jingwei's reply was published in yesterday's newspaper. The remaining letters and telegrams are as follows: Chiang Kai-shek's telegram: Urgent, Shanghai Mayor Wu to Commissioner He Xiangning, your message received. I have already taken steps to rescue him. Special reply, Zhongzheng. Yu Youren's telegram: Explore and deliver to Commissioner He Xiangning. Telegram received. Central comrades are very concerned about this matter and are determined to ensure his safety. Please be relieved. Yu Youren trapped. Luo Wengan's telegram: Commissioner He Xiangning, your message received. We have not yet been contacted about this matter. Have telegraphed Shanghai to inquire. First reply, Wengan. He Yingqin's telegram: Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, please translate to Madam He Xiangning. Your message received. We are not aware of the reason for your son's arrest in Shanghai. Special reply, He Yingqin Seal. Chen Gongbo's telegram: Madam Liao, regarding Chengzhi's matter, Tiecheng reported this morning. He is probably still in the British police station. Mr. Wang and I are now trying to rescue him, Gongbo. Jing Hengyi's letter: Madam Liao, telegram received. Met with Wang at the Party Headquarters a moment ago to find ways to rescue your son. Later, Wu Tiecheng also arrived and said that he had received the telegram and learned that he had been arrested by a certain agency. I don't know the real situation. I have asked him to do his best to find a way. Don't worry for now, lest it affects your health. Best regards, Chen Shuren's letter: Madam He Xiangning, I learned from Brother Ziyuan that Brother Chengzhi has been arrested, which is very concerning. I don't know what happened or where it happened. We should find a way to rescue him as soon as possible. Young people often encounter such misfortunes. I hope you can be broad-minded and calm down to handle the matter, and you can turn danger into safety. Chen Shuren, Ruowen. Sun Yuanliang's telegram: Teacher Liao, I have read your message and have telegraphed the relevant parties and will do my best to rescue him. Special reply, student Sun Yuanliang bows. Mei Zhezhi's telegram: Telegram received. We are aware of this matter. Wang and Chen are now trying to rescue him, Zhezhi.</p>
<p>Central Government Guarantees Safety. After her son Chengzhi was arrested, Madam He telegraphed various leaders to rescue him and sent her nephew Ma Jingyun to the capital to meet with various leaders. Madam He received a telegram from him yesterday reporting that Chen Shuren, Chen Gongbo, Chiang Kai-shek, and others all guaranteed his safety. The original telegram is as follows: Arrived in Beijing. Talks with Duke Shu and Jie and other commissioners. All guarantee absolute safety. Satisfactory result. Return by night train. Report in person, Ma trapped.</p>
<p>Continued Hearing Today. Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Higher Second Branch Court, had requested a postponement for further investigation during the preliminary hearing the day before yesterday and opposed bail. Therefore, Judge Yu ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for today (31st) afternoon. It is said that Liao's acting lawyer, Wu Kaisheng, will still demand his release in court or transfer to the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Civil Rights Protection League. The Civil Rights Protection League of China issued the following declaration yesterday regarding the Luo, Yu, and Liao cases. The Civil Rights Protection League of China is issuing this declaration to call the attention of the Chinese people to the court hearing today on the Luo, Yu, and Liao cases involving suspected Communists. It has become commonplace in our country for those who struggle for the labor and peasant movement and against imperialism to be detained, subjected to private torture, and killed. This is what this league has repeatedly protested. The Provisional Executive Committee of this league held a meeting yesterday morning to discuss this case and invited Dr. Wu Kaisheng, a well-known lawyer in Shanghai, to attend and discuss the defense matters. Cai Yuanpei and Soong Ching Ling have entrusted lawyer Wu to be responsible for handling this case. On March 28, Luo Dengxian, Yu Wenhua, and Liao Chengzhi were arrested based on reports from spies. According to newspaper reports, their crimes were joining the Communist Party and the labor union movement. Luo and Yu were arrested at their residences, while Liao was detained a few hours later simply because he happened to visit. On March 24, Chen Guang was also arrested based on a report from an informer. At the same time, a Ms. Chen (said to be Chen Guang's sister) was also detained after she happened to visit Chen's house after his arrest. Chen Guang's crime is "Commander of the 14th Army of the Jiangxi Communist Army." However, it is certain that there is no evidence whatsoever for the arrest of Chen and Ms. Chen. Chen Guang's residence and the five places where he had previously resided were all searched, but no evidence was found. The acts committed by Luo, Yu, and Liao were merely two people talking and a third person entering the room. In summary, the only evidence in each case is the report of a spy or the denunciation of an old acquaintance. According to legal principles, the testimony of a witness must be qualified and prove that they are not motivated by resentment. If people can be convicted based on empty words, can we still be concerned about the future of our people? Moreover, those who commit crimes must have criminal acts before they can be convicted. Even if the defendant is a member of the Communist Party or has participated in anti-imperialist or labor movements, it is not prohibited by law. If there are no special actions, they should be released immediately. Freedom of belief is repeatedly enshrined in the provisional constitution and is a right that our people must fight for. Lawyer Wu will expound on this legal principle in court today. The current dispute is especially about the extradition of the defendants. However, since there is no evidence against the defendants, the reason for the arrest is insufficient. Not only is extradition out of the question, but detention exceeding 24 hours is also a clear violation of regulations. During this time of national crisis, if we want to talk about resisting insults, the Chinese people must have the freedom to oppose imperialism. We should not oppress those who are working hard on this task, which would harm our vitality. Our people should quickly become aware and rise up to fight for the release of Luo, Yu, Liao, and all other political prisoners. Regarding the lawyers appearing in court, in addition to lawyer Wu Kaisheng, lawyer Ma Chang will represent Liao Chengzhi, lawyer Cai Xiaobai will represent Luo Dengxian and Yu Wenhua, and lawyers Tu Kunfan and Ni Jiong will represent Chen Guang. All these lawyers will fight for the protection of civil rights based on legal principles.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspaper Observes That Inspection of Factories in the Settlement by the Public Works Bureau Will Likely Pass</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that there are various reasons to believe that the motion proposed at the special meeting of Western taxpayers on April 19 will be passed without opposition. The purpose of the motion is to amend Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, which authorizes the Public Works Bureau to issue licenses to factories in the settlement so that they can be properly supervised. This special meeting will be held immediately after the annual meeting of Western taxpayers. However, this year, due to the increase in the number of qualified taxpayers, the legal quorum for the special meeting has also greatly increased. It is estimated that about 1,250 people will be needed to meet the legal quorum. However, given the importance of the nature of this case, it is expected that the number of taxpayers attending the meeting will reach this number. Owners and employers of commercial factories inside and outside the Public Concession have carefully considered this case. It is reported that the Shanghai Employers' Association, organized by Westerners, has expressed its full support. The reporter also inquired with the Public Works Bureau yesterday and learned that only this case will be discussed at the special meeting and no other cases will be raised.</p>
<h3>Postal Bureau Announcement on Returning Savings Deposits in Liaoning Area</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration Savings and Remittance Bureau issued a notice yesterday morning regarding the return of fixed deposit certificates for savings deposits in the Liaoning area. The notice states that all depositors in the three northeastern provinces who hold savings deposit books or fixed deposit certificates issued by the bureaus in the Liaoning postal area before July 23, 1932, and the bureaus in the Jilin and Heilongjiang postal areas before July 25, 1932, must register with the bureau in person or through their agents. The registration methods are detailed as follows: (1) Savings deposit books may be registered at any post office (excluding branches) in the country that handles savings deposit books. Fixed deposit certificates shall be registered at the post office (excluding branches) that handles fixed deposits. (2) If the depositor intends to keep the savings deposit in the post office, one month after the registration date, the registering post office will issue a new deposit book or new deposit certificate. For savings deposits in the Jilin and Heilongjiang postal areas, originally deposited in Harbin dollars, that is, the deposit book or certificate does not specify silver dollars, they shall be converted into silver dollars at an 80% discount. Interest on this retained savings deposit shall be calculated from the day after the last day of interest calculation in the three northeastern provinces (i.e., June 30, 1932). Interest on fixed deposits shall be calculated from the original deposit date at the original interest rate. (3) If the depositor wishes to withdraw the savings deposit, they must also, one month after the registration date, apply to the original registering bureau with a withdrawal slip, together with the savings deposit book or fixed deposit certificate, to withdraw the savings deposit, as usual.

The interest on all the withdrawn savings deposits shall be calculated in accordance with the method in section (2) above up to the date of registration. (4) If the post office deems it necessary, it may request the depositor to provide a reliable business guarantor before returning the savings deposit. (5) All savings deposit refund matters shall be handled at the original registering bureau. If the original savings deposit was deposited in Harbin dollars (see section (2) above), it shall be refunded at an 80% discount converted into silver dollars. The above provisions are hereby announced for general knowledge. Postmaster Zha Peilin.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Discusses the Case of the Sale of Tianjin Naval Academy</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday that the Tianjin Naval Academy has been sold by the Zhang family. The academy's land totals 30 to 40 mu. This sale included all of it, netting an estimated tens of thousands of dollars, probably around 700,000. The seller has already sold it. In addition to the Naval Department reporting it to the Executive Yuan for handling, there are no other opinions that can be expressed. However, Chairman Chiang also advocates abolishing the contract and finding ways to recover it, because the land belongs to the state and cannot be privately sold by one or two people. As for how the central government will handle the recovery, the details are not yet known. The Naval Department has not sent a special commissioner to investigate, only instructed Zhang Tingchao, the former principal of the Tianjin Naval Academy, to investigate and report. Chen is scheduled to return to Nanjing today after finishing his business.</p>
<h3>Zheng Jicheng Dedicates Himself to the Frontier</h3>
<p>Zheng Jicheng, the protagonist in the assassination of Zhang Zongchang, has been granted amnesty by the central government and has decided to dedicate his life to resisting Japan. The following is a recent personal letter from him from Jinan to Wang Yaodong, a representative of the Shandong Association in Shanghai: Brother Yaodong, I have received your letter. Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of heroes and comrades at home and abroad, and thanks to the central government upholding justice and complying with public opinion, I have been granted amnesty. This order arrived in Jinan the day before yesterday, and I was also released at the same time. However, as I have just been released from confinement, I have many social engagements, and my reply has been slightly delayed. I trust that you, being understanding, will not blame me. I still have some trivial family matters to attend to and am waiting to settle them. Once everything is settled, I have decided to dedicate my life to resisting Japan, regardless of success or failure. I hope that you will give me guidance from time to time so that I can follow it. This is the only way I can repay the public and private debts. Special reply, respectfully wishing you a happy spring. Yours sincerely, March 26, Zheng Jicheng.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Telegram to Zhang Zilian</h3>
<p>| Please Advocate for All Sectors to Provide Relief to Song Zheyuan |</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Union, received a telegram from Feng Yuxiang yesterday stating: This time, Commander Song Zheyuan personally led his officers and soldiers in a bloody battle with the enemy for nine days and nights, engaging in more than twenty hand-to-hand combats, rendering the enemy's tanks, artillery, machine guns ineffective, and killing more than ten thousand enemies, which has frightened the enemy. The details of his victory are published in various newspapers and need not be repeated. The hand-to-hand combat resulted in extremely heavy casualties, with approximately 7,000 officers and soldiers killed or wounded. The officers and soldiers are determined to be war ghosts rather than slaves of a fallen nation, advancing without retreat, and fighting to the death. The supplies for the frontline officers and soldiers are extremely scarce. They have no shoes or socks, the dead have no coffins, and the wounded have no medicine. It is heartbreaking to see and hear. Fortunately, enthusiastic compatriots are providing relief continuously, which is of some help. Mr. is a well-known figure and a leader in charity and has always been enthusiastic about it. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, when Commander Song's officers and soldiers are suffering hardships and difficulties, I ask you to give them full assistance. Please raise your voice and achieve this good deed, providing both spiritual and material assistance. Please inform friends from all walks of life to help together so that Commander Song's officers and soldiers can concentrate on fighting and killing the enemy without worrying about the lack of materials in the rear. The compatriots in Jiangnan are generous and righteous, and the officers and soldiers will certainly sacrifice their lives to repay them. Sincere request and hope for a reply, Feng Yuxiang.</p>

<h3>Record of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng took the night train to Nanjing last night and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning. Dai Jitao, Ju Zheng, and Li Liejun are also traveling with him.

<p>Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan took the night train to Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao Telegrams the Central Government Requesting Thorough Investigation of the Dismissal Dispute at the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>According to sources at the Railway Bureau, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration recently dismissed staff members and issued articles attacking Director Huang outside the bureau, causing many misunderstandings. Therefore, in addition to sending a letter to the local newspapers the day before yesterday disclosing the facts, Director Huang also telegraphed the central government requesting that an impartial official be dispatched to the bureau for a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Appeal of the Dismissed Employees of the Two Railway Bureaus Held Reception for the Press Last Night to Explain the Situation</h3>
<p>Sixty-one dismissed employees of the two railway bureaus, including Mao Yinbai, held a reception for the press at the Zhimei Restaurant last night. Mr. Mao first reported, stating that the colleagues had served in the railway for one or two decades, or five or six years, and were not appointed by one person at one time. Some had studied railway specialties at universities at home and abroad and obtained degrees, or had made contributions through writing and had long enjoyed considerable fame in the railway industry. Moreover, they all had practical work experience, and dozens of directors and direct supervisors had been replaced. There were many honest and reliable authorities among them, and even if there were cases of favoritism and corruption, they could not have been retained until now. Moreover, most of them had worked at risk during the Shanghai Incident or had been loyal and diligent day and night, and had made contributions. However, shortly after Huang took office, he brazenly ignored the facts and successively dismissed about 61 people while adding about 57 new people. The dismissal orders all used the language "dismissed immediately, awaiting other appointments," without any reasons. He requested that the media uphold justice and had reported to the Ministry of Railways for a thorough investigation. At the same time, the colleagues had raised three questions to Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Bureaus: (1) reinstate the dismissed staff members in accordance with the law; (2) if the old employees cannot be reinstated, no new employees shall be appointed in order to comply with the principle of thrift; (3) if it is said that the dismissed personnel have engaged in corruption or dereliction of duty, the facts should be clearly announced to ensure fairness. However, Huang has not yet provided a concrete reply.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Resolve to Form a National Political Participation Promotion Association, Electing Lin Kanghou and Eight Others as Members</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Federation invited various public groups to discuss ways to prepare recommendations to the central government for wartime organization. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the final general reception was held at the Bank Association Clubhouse, and it was decided to form the National Political Participation Promotion Association. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Groups. Yesterday's attendees included Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce, Qian Chengxu of the China Industrial Federation, Cao Yunxiang (representing Tang Zeyi) of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association, Li Mengnan of the General Labor Union, Lu Muqin of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Pan Yangyao of the Vocational Guidance Center, Sun Choucheng of the National Goods Factory Union, Gong Yaochen of the Flour Industry Union, Hu Juewen of the Steel and Machinery Industry Association, Hu Xiyuan of the Ya Pu Er Electric Appliance Factory, Xu Yunzhi of the Greater China Scientific Research Society, Yan Qingxiang of the Suzhou Industrial Branch, Zhao Yunan of the Oriental Literary Society, and more than 20 representatives from more than ten public groups.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report. Chairman Qian Chengxu reported, "Representatives and comrades, I am very pleased that you have graced us with your presence. China is now facing a great disaster. We don't need to talk about the past. The most important and urgent thing to plan for now is to figure out a way for the Chinese nation to find a way out. To sum it up, there are three proposals in society today. The first is to convene a national conference, the second is national political participation, and the third is to change the status of the current government and change it to a wartime organization. Among these three, our association feels that the third proposal seems to be more in line with the current needs. Therefore, we have drafted a proposal and invited you to discuss it together today. At the same time, we want to ask you to advise on whether this proposal is appropriate and whether it can be adapted to the current environment. Our association has invited various public groups twice for this event. Today is the last day of the general reception, which is held based on the opinions decided by the public groups in the previous two sessions. However, the China Industrial Federation itself is a member of the mass organization and is weak. Therefore, we ask you representatives to come up with a way to save our China together."</p>
<p>Forming the Political Participation Association. After starting the discussion, representatives from various public groups expressed their opinions one after another, and it was decided that (1) the National Political Participation Promotion Association should be formed first, (2) Lin Kanghou, Qian Chengxu, Xu Yunzhi, Tang Zeyi, Pan Yangyao, Wang Yaochen, Hu Xiyuan, Li Mengnan, Sun Choucheng, and other nine people should be elected as members, (3) Lin Kanghou and Qian Chengxu should be responsible for convening the first committee meeting, and (4) a declaration should be issued.</p>
<h3>Results of the American Chamber of Commerce Discussion on the Case of Marking the Nationality of Imported Goods</h3>
<p>Requesting the Central Government to Amend the New Regulations</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the American Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting at the Citibank General Assembly yesterday (29th) afternoon to discuss the new customs regulations on marking the country of origin of imported goods in Chinese. It was decided to request the national government to amend the new regulations through appropriate diplomatic channels to allow the country of origin to be marked in both Chinese and English and to extend the implementation period to New Year's Day next year so that manufacturers have sufficient preparation time. It would be especially convenient to comply with if certain goods, especially such as paper cigarettes, cigars, candies, photographic goods, and optical instruments, could be marked only on the packaging and not on the goods themselves. After the meeting, Secretary Kim issued a statement listing the various difficulties in complying with the new regulations.</p>
<h3>French Garrison to Conduct Tank Exercises</h3>
<p>To be Held Tomorrow Afternoon at 2:30 PM</p>
<p>Gunfire Expected at That Time, Residents Are Requested Not to Be Alarmed</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Saturday, April 1st) at 2:30 PM, the French Concession garrison will conduct tank exercises on vacant land in the western district of the concession. There will be loud gunfire at that time, but it will all be blank ammunition. Residents nearby may not know the reason and misunderstand, so this is a pre-announcement.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Abolition of Meat Inspection</h3>
<p>Telegrams to the Executive Yuan and Replies to the Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a report from the Cured Meat and Ham Industry Association stating that the Municipal Health Bureau will implement inspection work and collect huge fees, which is inconsistent with the Commodity Inspection Law. It dispatched representatives to request assistance and telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the facts, requesting them to be abolished immediately, and replied to the Health Bureau. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan. Nanjing Executive Yuan and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, The Cured Meat and Ham Industry Association stated that the case of inspection of salted and cured meat products in this city was petitioned to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by the Cured Meat and Ham Industry Association in Nanjing last year, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was granted an explicit order to abolish it. Unexpectedly, it was reported that it will be implemented again on the 1st of next month, which is shocking. According to the approval of the Executive Yuan, one is that since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has consulted with the Municipal Government to stop the inspection of the meat, it should not be held again. The other is that the Municipal Government should be instructed to instruct the Health Bureau to cancel the original proposal for the inspection. The wording is firm and there should be no room for reversal. However, the Municipal Government is discussing holding it again only three months after receiving the approval. It is not in accordance with putting national credibility and commercial difficulties aside. Moreover, cured meat and ham are one of the national products. At this time of commercial decline and difficult operation, we should pay attention to the people's difficulties and immediately order the Municipal Health Bureau to fundamentally abolish it to avoid disturbances. It is also convenient for the public to ask for all the requests to be transferred to abolish the previous case and wait for the reply from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Reply to the Health Bureau. Directly reply, This month's 30th received a letter, based on the city's inspection of meat entering the market, the two years ago had begun preparations before the issue of authority, pending instructions, temporarily suspended implementation, now scheduled to implement the inspection from April 1 this year, in addition to another announcement, instructed to inform the meat merchants to comply with and so on, through the meeting, check this matter has received the cured meat and ham two industry associations, based on the meat, is strictly selected from the place of origin, plus curing has never been found in the health on the place where it hinders, ask the bureau to exempt from inspection fees, because the bureau insisted, but by the two industry public to promote representatives to the Executive Yuan petition, On December 30 last year, the Executive Yuan approved the order to know that the municipal government canceled the original proposal and other reasons in the case, and assess the process of the petition in this case, as well as the circumstances of the revocation of the approval, is not as requested by the letter, due to the relationship of authority, the two industries themselves saw the newspaper news, has been in accordance with the law to make a second petition, the association since the letter before not easy to transfer to comply with, in view of the above, the corresponding letter is sent to reply, please check the case. To Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Public Bonds Scheduled for Redemption</h3>
<p>Lottery to be Drawn in Shanghai on April 5th</p>
<p>The second redemption of the Jiang-Zhe Silk Industry Public Bonds of the 20th year of the Republic of China is now scheduled for 10:00 AM on April 5th. The lottery will be drawn simultaneously with the Financial Consolidation and Military Reduction Public Bonds at the Bankers' Association, No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance has already sent a letter to the financial community to arrange this.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Various Financial Matters</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussed matters related to donations, taxes, and budgets at its meeting on the 17th. All resolutions passed have been submitted to the Board of Directors for approval on the 29th. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Appropriately Increase Subsidies to the Royal Asiatic Society: The Society recently submitted a letter detailing its efforts to raise funds, and the amount of donations has increased significantly. However, the current operating expenses still fall short by approximately two thousand taels. The committee members believe that the Society has exhausted its fundraising methods, and it is feasible for the Council to provide a special subsidy for the shortfall. Therefore, it was suggested that the Society's subsidy be appropriately increased by approximately two thousand taels within this year. However, it was declared that this is a special measure and should not be taken as a precedent for future years.</p>
<p>Medical Examinations in Schools to be Temporarily Postponed: The issue of medical examinations in schools was discussed at the last Board of Directors meeting. Subsequently, the Director of Public Health reported to the Finance Committee that the first year of implementation would cost approximately forty thousand taels. He also stated that this initiative is a common duty in modern municipal administration and is becoming increasingly popular in Chinese cities, so the Shanghai Municipal Council should not lag behind. A committee member said that the Council already spends approximately two-tenths of its income on education expenses. If medical examinations are implemented, the annual expenditure will increase significantly in the future. The Chief Financial Officer also said that although efforts have been made to balance this year's budget, all major new projects, no matter how beneficial, should be approached with extreme caution. Therefore, this initiative should be postponed until next year for further discussion. After detailed discussion, it was decided that if the economy is sufficient, this initiative should be implemented as soon as possible. However, no funds will be allocated for it this year.</p>
<p>Hotel License Fees to be Reasonably Regulated: The Finance Department proposed changes to the collection amounts of various donation and license fees. Regarding Chinese-style hotels, someone suggested that in addition to calculating the license fee based on the number of rooms, a method of calculating based on the number of beds could be added. The Chief Financial Officer said that he had carefully considered this proposal and found it excessive. He suggested that the maximum amount of this quarterly license fee be increased from two hundred taels to three hundred taels (the minimum amount has always been three taels), and the estimation procedures be waived so that the Donations Department can carefully consider the severity and ensure that the burden is evenly distributed. A committee member said that the maximum amount was only increased from eighty taels to two hundred taels last year, and now this proposal seeks to increase it by another half. Furthermore, having two standards for collecting donations may be detrimental to poorer hotels. The Chief Financial Officer said that the donation officers have always been very careful in grading and will pay close attention to avoid excessive collection even if the maximum amount is increased. After discussion, it was resolved to set the maximum license fee amount for this item at two hundred and fifty taels per quarter.</p>
<p>Issue of Increased Donations for Entertainment Venues: Regarding the increase in the burden of municipal expenses on entertainment venues, the Chief Financial Officer stated that this proposal arose from the recommendation of the Medical Investigation Committee. However, the principles and implementation methods still require detailed consideration. Subsequently, the Director-General stated that a maximum amount should be set for this levy to seek the approval of taxpayers. The committee resolved that the Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with the Director-General, should carefully determine how to propose this increase in fees. In addition to the above opinions, all the submitted collection schedules for various donations, license fees, etc., for the year 1933 were approved by the committee.</p>
<p>Administrative Expenses of the Finance and Other Departments: The budgets for the Finance Department (including the Donations Department), the Intelligence Department, the Legal Department, the Director-General's Office, and the Director-General's Office were all approved by the committee. Among them, the finance budget includes an administrative expense of ten thousand taels for educational undertakings. Following the principle of clearly listing education expenses, this amount is allocated under the education budget item. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of donation collection, the Donations Department needs to add experts with knowledge of valuation and other aspects, and it is planned to allocate approximately five thousand taels to find and employ them. As for the Director-General's Office's expenses, they have also increased due to the employment of an expert to handle matters related to industrial management and factory inspections.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team's Budget Draft for This Year</h3>
<p>The estimated expenditure for the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team this year is 176,460 taels, while the amount for last year was 156,490 taels. According to the Chief Financial Officer's explanation at the Finance Committee, this increase is due to the financial difficulties last year, which delayed the long-term vacation of certain team members. As a result, the salary and travel expenses for this year have increased significantly. Regarding advertising expenses, the draft originally listed 4,460, which is approximately double that of last year. According to the Music Team Leader's explanation, this expense is prepared for expanding advertising when performing at the New Grand Cathay Theatre in the future. Before obtaining this convenience, there are no plans to increase this expense. After discussion, it was agreed to reduce this amount to 4,000 taels. As for the team leader's proposal to publish advertisements in Chinese and Japanese newspapers, it was unanimously approved. Furthermore, during the long-term vacation of the team's deputy leader, it is planned to temporarily hire a musician. This move was unanimously approved by the committee. Regarding the purchase of new sheet music, the original proposal listed 2,500 taels. The Chief Financial Officer said that this item was only 800 taels last year and should be reduced. The Music Team Leader replied that no new sheet music was purchased last year. This expense is only for copying needs. However, in order to attract audiences, it is necessary to purchase new works this year. The committee members expressed their approval of this idea but reduced the original amount to 2,000 taels. The Music Team Leader also said that after the New Grand Cathay Theatre can be used, the maintenance and repair costs may not need to be as high as 1,200 taels. This amount was immediately reduced to 800 taels. Furthermore, the original proposal listed the purchase of a pair of kettle drums, priced at 500 taels. According to the team leader, a team member can engage in preliminary selection during this year's vacation, and the purchase can be made next year. As a result, this item was removed from this year's budget. This revised budget draft has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and has been returned to the Finance Committee for further review and decision.</p>

<h3>Nefarious Scheme of Bandits to Intercept Cars</h3>
<p>A Thief Throws Stones to Smash Car Windows on the Side of the Road</p>
<p>When the Driver Stops to Negotiate, a Crowd of Bandits Swarms Up</p>
<p>丨Yang Xilin and Wife Robbed on the Way to Tomb Sweeping丨</p>
<p>Yang Xilin, a local, works at the Changzhou Railway Station, and his family also lives in Changzhou. Yang recently took a train to Shanghai with his wife to sweep the tombs for the Qingming Festival. After arriving in Shanghai, he hired a car to go to the tombs in the Caohejing and Longhua areas. They finished around 5 p.m. and were returning from Caohejing. As the car was turning a corner on the way, it was driving slowly when suddenly a short-clothed person on the side of the road threw a stone at the car from the left side, shattering the glass. The car driver saw that the glass was broken and stopped the car to pull the short-clothed person, asking him to pay for the damage. Unexpectedly, three people ran up from behind, pulled out guns, and threatened to monitor the situation. Yang saw the situation and knew that they were bandits. As he was taking out a police whistle from his pocket to blow it, two bandits rushed into the car and used their guns to stop him from making noise. Seeing Yang holding the police whistle, they were very angry and slapped him, throwing the police whistle out. A bandit who was monitoring the car driver picked it up. The bandits first searched Yang's body and took away the 70-80 silver yuan and a gold watch he was carrying. Then, they forcibly removed his wife's two gold rings and a fashionable watch from her hand. After searching, the two bandits forced the car driver to drive along with them. The bandits held guns and monitored from behind. After about a li, the two bandits fled. The car driver ran back, and Yang and his wife sat in the car, extremely frightened. They drove the car back immediately, and Yang sighed repeatedly, feeling very frustrated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Film Censorship Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously appointed an investigation committee to study the censorship of films. The committee's report has recently been carefully considered by the Security Committee. The Security Committee's proposals have now been adopted by the Board of Directors. The report of the investigation committee was published in the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette in October of last year. Subsequently, various departments submitted their opinions, and the Security Committee compiled and considered them in early December. Regarding the Police Commissioner's statement that external criticisms of film censorship mostly concern the nature of the films rather than the standards of censorship, the committee expressed agreement. Furthermore, the Security Committee believed that the Municipal Council could not grant the Censorship Committee the power of final decision, as proposed in the original report. In summary, there is no need for drastic reforms to the current methods, and since there are no difficulties with the currently employed volunteer committee members, there is no need to appoint paid committee members. After repeated discussions, the committee also failed to endorse the proposal to establish a preview room. At the Security Committee meeting on the 23rd of this month, the Police Commissioner submitted a supplementary report presenting various suggestions from the investigation committee. After careful review by the Security Committee, it was deemed that the various methods already adopted or to be adopted by the Police Department should be followed. All opinions signed by the Police Department, except for those already explained, are listed below. The original report proposed that the Police Department should provide information to the censorship committee members. The Police Department noted that the monthly reports of the Police Department's inspectors are currently being copied and sent to each censorship committee member. These reports contain summaries of each film, deleted sections, and the reasons for them. The original report proposed that the Public Concession and the French Concession should cooperate as much as possible. The Police Department noted that it is very satisfied with the close cooperation between the authorities of the two concessions. The original report stated that the prohibition of films with political content should be presided over by the police commissioners of the two concessions. The Police Department noted that all films with political content must be reported to the Police Commissioner by the responsible censorship officer before they can be approved for screening. The original report stated that in case of doubt, police inspectors seem to tend to allow films to pass. The Police Department noted that this statement is inaccurate. In case of doubt, police officers immediately order the questionable part to be cut. If this is not done, they report to their superiors and the censorship committee. The original report stated that there are too many films, and the current experienced inspectors are not sufficient. The Police Department noted that the current system meets the needs of the film industry and does not cause undue hardship for the personnel. There is no need to increase personnel. The original report proposed that there should be one censorship committee member present at each preview. This member should not influence the decision of the censorship officer but should either express agreement or order that part or all of the film be sent to the censorship committee for review after the officer's decision. The Police Department noted that each committee member is notified of each preview. Any opinions of the committee members are immediately noted, whether communicated by letter or telegram to the responsible police assistant. The original report proposed that the certificate of approval should be signed by one censorship committee member. The Police Department noted that the screening license is issued in the name of the Police Commissioner. Therefore, it seems appropriate for it to be signed by a police officer. A clearer license form is currently being redesigned. The theaters have agreed to display the license near the ticket office at all times. Regarding the principles of censorship, the original report proposed that special attention should be paid to matters related to national sentiment and national dignity. The Police Department noted that police inspectors have always paid special attention to this issue. The original report proposed classifying films to indicate whether a film is suitable for children to watch. The Police Department noted that although there is no specific classification method at present, if the censorship officers believe that a film is not suitable for children, they instruct the theaters to announce this. The theaters comply immediately. The original report proposed that film companies should be registered. The Police Department noted that the Municipal Council's power to dispose of films does not extend to the management of film companies. Regarding the establishment of a preview room in a suitable location, Mr. Bredon has detailed his proposed plan, and the Director of Public Health has also investigated and reported on converting a health sub-office into a preview room. However, since the Police Commissioner has stated that he is very satisfied with the current preview methods, the Security Committee believes that there is no need to spend a large sum of money to establish a preview room, and the matter should not be considered further.</p>
<h3>Consecutive Stoppage of Japanese Ships Due to Anti-Japanese Sentiment</h3>
<p>▲The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 24th that since the rise of anti-Japanese sentiment in various parts of China, the transportation business of Japanese steamships has been declining daily. Vessels connecting central and northern China, such as the Dalian Steamship Company's Tianjin Maru, which departed Shanghai on March 5th, and the Kawasaki Steamship Company's Itozaki Maru, which departed Tianjin on March 10th, will be their last voyages. In the future, these routes will inevitably be monopolized by the British Taikoo Dockyard &amp; Engineering Company, the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the Chinese China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In short, it is regrettable that Japanese ships have repeatedly suspended operations due to anti-Japanese sentiment. However, the situation in the Chinese interior is relatively different. For example, in Shandong, due to negotiations with local officials, anti-Japanese sentiment is loudly proclaimed on the surface, but in reality, it has not been significantly affected, and buying and selling transactions continue as usual. Therefore, the import of Japanese goods has been quite prosperous for a time. However, recently, transactions in the Tianjin and Beijing areas have been relatively stagnant.</p>
<p>▲The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 22nd that Hengzhu Heitaro, the Commercial Counselor stationed in China, returned to Japan on the Shanghai Maru on the 31st for important business matters and made the following statement upon entry at Nagasaki regarding the state of trade with China: Currently, the boycott of Japanese goods continues unabated. However, practical commodities are gradually expanding their position regardless of any suppression. Foreigners who do not handle Japanese goods are now gradually increasing their demand for Japanese goods. Recently, two large-scale Japanese department stores have been opened in the French Concession, changing the packaging styles and brands, and their sales performance in the market is excellent. As for the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people, it cannot be changed in a day or two. Therefore, we should make special efforts in this regard.</p>
<h3>YWCA Studies Implementation of Factory Law</h3>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has always paid close attention to labor issues, especially the implementation of the Factory Law in recent years. Recently, with the successive accidents in the Zhen Tai and Yong He factories in Shanghai, which resulted in many worker deaths, the issue of implementing the Factory Law has attracted serious attention. The Shanghai YWCA held a special discussion with experts on labor issues in Shanghai on the issue, to find practical solutions. They held their first study session on the 23rd of this month, entitled "The Relationship and Obstacles to the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Concessions." Yesterday, they held a second study session at the YWCA at 8 Yuanmingyuan Road, entitled "The Contents of the Factory Law." First, Mr. Tian Hexiang gave a detailed account of the municipal government's plan for inspection work, the first step in the inspection work of factories in the Chinese area, and the obstacles to inspecting factories in the concessions. Then, Mr. Zhu Maocheng explained the drafting of the Factory Law and its contents. The study concluded that the standards of China's Factory Law are lower than those of other countries, and the treatment of workers is also inferior. The implementation of the entire Factory Law would not lead to the closure of factories. The claim that some capitalists make the claim that factories cannot be maintained is a superficial view. However, if the concession authorities are never willing to cooperate sincerely, the Factory Law of China cannot be implemented consistently, which would lead to many malpractices and obstacles. Therefore, the Chinese people should first promote public opinion, urge the government, and make a consistent proposition, and not rest until the goal of uniform implementation of the Factory Law in the concessions and the Chinese area is achieved, so as to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Datong Music Society Launches Large-Scale Musical Instrument Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Datong Music Society, founded 14 years ago, aims to promote inherent Chinese music and improve musical instruments. Last year, it completed a full set of Chinese ancient and modern musical instruments, more than 160 kinds. Recently, in order to strive for perfection, it has newly made twelve-tone pipa, xiao, flute, bottle qin, and domestically produced violin, ukulele, and other instruments. The materials are excellent, and the timbre is accurate, far surpassing the products sold in the market. It is now planning to create sound films of the whole set of musical instruments and music, which will be handled by the Mingxing Film Company. The film will be transported to the United States to participate in the Chicago World's Fair, to promote China's inherent culture. Recently, there have been many people from various provinces ordering instruments from the association, so it has had to set up a formal business department to cope with the demand. For this reason, it is launching a musical instrument company called Datong, with an initial capital of 100,000 yuan. Formal preparations have already begun, and fundraising will begin soon. The content of the instruments produced will be divided into 13 major categories, including metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, wood, rattlesnake, eggplant, Wei, shell, and mane, with more than 200 kinds in total. This move is of great importance to the future of the country's culture.</p>
<h3>Participate in the Chicago Expo Photography Exhibit and Sell Tickets for a Raffle</h3>
<p>丨Each Ticket is Five Yuan to Donate to the Righteous Army丨</p>
<p>The China Travel Service is collecting photography exhibits for the preparatory committee of the Chicago World's Fair. Since the public exhibition was held in the Shanghai Bank Library, it has been well-received by all parties. No fewer than 5,000 people have visited. For the purpose of donating to the Northeast Righteous Army, the society has obtained the consent of the exhibitors to sell the exhibits at a marked price, and many have already been sold. Now, in response to requests from all walks of life, the society has extended the exhibition to April 20th and is selling the photography exhibits at a marked price. It is difficult to expect the ordinary, so a kind of sales ticket is printed, and each ticket is sold for a uniform price of five yuan. A public lottery will be held at the Shanghai Bank Library on April 20th. The ticket holders can redeem a photo with the matching number. The ticket sales offices are located at the society on Sichuan Road and its branches in various districts.</p>

<h3>Banquet for Zhi Rou Boxing Club</h3>
<p>丨Welcoming Mr. Chen Weiming丨</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock, members of the Zhi Rou Club gathered at Jue Garden on Avenue Edward VII to welcome Mr. Chen Weiming, the president of the club, who had recently returned to Shanghai from Guangdong. More than 60 people attended. Before the banquet, the members practiced frames and pushing hands, and Mr. Weiming was asked to correct them. Chen's frames were all upright, correct, quiet and orderly, and his pushing hands were conscientious in pushing, deflecting, and squeezing, which was highly praised by Mr. Weiming. After the banquet, Mr. Weiming and the members engaged in pushing hands, and they were able to understand the principle of not losing or resisting. The attitude of the master and disciples being so close and loving, and the sincere desire to study boxing, were unimaginable to the teachers and students of school education.</p>
<h3>Death of Shang Tuant Chinese Officer Chong Dihua</h3>
<p>Served for Over Twenty-Three Years</p>
<p>Armed Funeral to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Chong Dihua, who served as a sergeant in the Chinese team of the International Volunteer Corps for many years, passed away in Shanghai yesterday (the 30th) due to illness. The armed funeral will be held tomorrow (the 1st) at 3 p.m. Mr. Chong was 52 years old this year and was from Shanghai. He was originally engaged in customs declaration and founded the Fuxin Public Customs Declaration Firm. He joined the team before the founding of the Republic of China and has served for 23 years. He has won the most valuable long-service medal. He was usually enthusiastic about public welfare and acted bravely for righteousness. He participated in all previous actions to maintain public security. During the January 28th Incident last year, he was able to devote himself to public service despite his illness, which led to overwork. His enthusiasm for the people is truly unmatched. It is reported that the captain of the team deeply mourned Mr. Chong's death from overwork. In addition to submitting an application to the commander of the business group to adopt military honors, he has also notified all normal team members to attend the funeral and express their condolences and honor to comfort the spirit.</p>
<h3>Postal Telegraphic Remittance Facilitates the Public</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, since the establishment of telegraphic money orders, the public has been greatly facilitated. This kind of telegraphic remittance has simple procedures and prompt payment, so the public has been using it a lot. The differences between telegraphic money orders and ordinary money orders are described below for the readers. For telegraphic money orders, the paying post office, after receiving a wired or wireless telegraphic notice from the remitting post office, immediately prepares a telegraphic money order and sends it directly to the payee. Therefore, the funds of the telegraphic remittance can usually be received on the same day. Ordinary money orders must be sent by mail. If human intervention is strictly enforced, occasional losses may occur, or if the payee loses it after receiving it, the payment of funds may be delayed. In short, the telegraphic money order business is more convenient for the public the farther the remittance destination is.</p>
<h3>Funding for the Shanghai Branch of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine is Secured</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine is striving to promote, guide, and improve Chinese medicine.

The board of directors of the branch decided that every Chinese medicine practitioner in the city should pay one cent of the ocean for each prescription issued to the branch for expenses. The prescriptions must first be sent for stamping, and fees will be charged based on the number of prescriptions. This has been submitted to the Central National Academy of Chinese Medicine for approval and is scheduled to be implemented on April 1st. Since the announcement was issued, Chinese medicine practitioners have been enthusiastically sending prescriptions for stamping and payment.</p>
<h3>Travel Agency Launches Spring Hangzhou Tour Special Train</h3>

<h3>Mental Doctor Li Shaoguang Makes Long-Term Donations</h3>
<p>丨Assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army丨</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shaoguang, a mental therapist in Shanghai, has achieved remarkable results since opening his practice not long ago. Recently, General Ye Kaixin's wife suffered from phlegm, asthma, and insomnia, which were severe illnesses of seven years, and his daughter suffered from memory loss. After Li's treatment, all of them started to show signs of improvement. Therefore, there is an endless stream of people seeking treatment. For convenience, Mr. Li has moved his clinic to 656 Jing'an Villa, Weihaiwei Road, telephone 30065, i.e., Zhongshe No. 7. Recently, Mr. Li heard Mr. Zhu Zi talk about the suffering of the Northeast Volunteer Army in defending the country and their desire for assistance at the welcome banquet. Mr. Li was deeply moved and decided to donate 10% of his consultation fees to assist the Volunteer Army from now on until the lost land is recovered, in order to realize his long-cherished ambition of saving people and the country. People like Mr. Li can be said to be seeing righteousness and acting, not forgetting those in the wilderness. His long-term donation to show his determination to fight to the end is even more heroic and commendable. It is reported that Mr. Li has been studying psychotherapy for more than ten years and has many unique insights. Except for external injuries, poisoning, and acute infectious diseases, all other diseases can be treated. The reason why he can achieve the effect of healing without medicine is all based on using healthy suggestions to eliminate disease concepts and induce alternating reactions in psychological effects (Conditionedreflex) and the philosophy of psychophysical parallelism. Therefore, he is handy and the treatments are always effective, which is not comparable to the charlatans and superstitious people. If you have an incurable disease, why not try it? It will be beneficial to both self and others.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Falls and Dies from Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>丨Result of Poor Road Conditions丨</p>
<p>An old woman, Zhang Zhou, 60 years old, residing in Kuaizi Alley outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, is a native of Rugao, Jiangbei. She has a son, Shao Yi, 36 years old. Due to poor family circumstances, he goes out every day to pull rickshaws, hoping to make a small profit to make a living. Yesterday morning at around 6 o'clock, Zhang borrowed a rickshaw from the Qinglong Zhengxing rickshaw stall and pulled it to Dongjiadu to wait for customers. A Shaoxing man, Shao Yaozhou, 48 years old, who has been selling vegetables in a vegetable market near Yongxing Road in Zhabei, came to Dongjiadu in Nanshi yesterday morning with baskets to wholesale a load of pickled vegetables. He then hired Zhang's rickshaw to sell in Zhabei. At that time, Zhang immediately pulled up the rickshaw and sprinted forward. Unexpectedly, when passing the Damatoukou, because the road was under repair and the road was uneven, he accidentally fell to the ground, bleeding from his mouth and nose. Shao also fell from the car and injured his waist. He got up from the ground in pain and suddenly saw Zhang lying on the ground, motionless. Upon inspection, he realized that he had died. The third guard post in that area, Zhou Youzhen, heard about it and rushed to the scene. Seeing this, he immediately moved Zhang's body to the side of the road and took Shao to the First District General Office for preliminary interrogation by District Chief Min. Because the matter involved human life, he ordered that Shao be detained temporarily and sent Dihua, a local leader of the sixteenth pu, to the Shanghai Local Court to request an autopsy. At around 5 p.m., Yang, the prosecutor appointed by the court, arrived at the scene with the coroner and determined that the deceased, Zhang Shaoyi, had died from internal injuries caused by a fall during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his family members to prepare a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Female Performer Jin Suqin Sues the Mingxing Daily</h3>
<p>Sues for Defamation and Obscenity</p>
<p>Jin Suqin, a female performer who performs at the Sanxing Stage on Niuzhuang Road, recently hired lawyer Chen Bingxing through her father, Jin Huanzhang, as her legal representative, to sue the Mingxing Daily and the screenwriter "Pao Longtao" (alias) for defamation and obscenity. The case was heard in the Ninth Criminal Court of the Special District Court yesterday afternoon by Judge Wang. According to Jin Huanzhang, he is a native of Hangzhou. His daughter, Suqin, has been learning Peking opera for many years. In 1920, she was hired as a Huashan actress at the Sanxing Stage. The director of the stage is Zhao Ruquan, and the internal organization is very complete. Except that there is no distinction between men and women in the front of the stage, the male and female actors are also polite when talking to each other. Unexpectedly, on the 15th of this month, the Mingxing Daily, which was run by the defendants, published a news story about the romantic drama of Jin Suqin and Mr. Zhao Junyu. The content was extremely obscene and used all means of defamation. For example, the plaintiff and Mr. Zhao Junyu, on Wednesday of last week (i.e., the 8th of this month), when rehearsing the nineteenth Peng Gong An, made an appointment in the number room. Jin Suqin and Mr. Zhao Junyu both achieved their goals, and this kind of ambiguous thing, the act of Sang Pu, was tried by Ouyang De and Sheng Guanbao (according to Ouyang De and Sheng Guanbao, the names of the characters in the play, played by Zhao Ruquan and Du Wenlin) and double-checked Zhao Junyu (the above is only a summary, and the full text is attached), etc., making it impossible to bear.</p>
<p>The plaintiff is only twenty years old and is still a young woman. How can she allow herself to be defamed by this unfounded fact? The newspaper not only published this kind of defamatory and immoral text, but also published the plaintiff's recent portrait, so as to prove its reality. The deliberate insult is very obvious. It concerns her personal reputation, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, Jin Huanzhang, the plaintiff's father, and Shi Hanzhang, etc., together with the plaintiff's representative lawyer, went to Yipinxing Hotel to investigate and view the circulation book of Gui You (22nd year of the Republic of China), the fifth volume of the company, and there was no such fact. On that day, only a Zhuang family held a wedding there, which proves that the facts reported by the newspaper are purely fabricated out of thin air and publicly defamed. Judge Wang checked the confession. Because the case concerned reputation, if the defendant can publish a statement in the newspaper to clarify that the content is false, then Jin Suqin's reputation can be restored. When the draft statement was published in the newspaper, the defendant insisted on drafting it himself, and the plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction, so it could not be reconciled. Therefore, the trial will continue. Because it is still necessary to summon the witnesses, the trial will be continued on April 12.</p>

<h3>Person Dies by Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th of this month, Li Shunying, a man claiming to be from Suzhou, 22 years old this year, who was engaged in the rice shop business, went to a hotel on Zilaihuoxing Street in the French Concession alone and opened room 210. He paid a room fee of two yuan. He went out the day before yesterday afternoon and returned to the hotel to sleep at night. It is unknown what irritated him, but he committed suicide by taking poison. By noon yesterday, because he had not gotten up, the hotel attendant knocked on the door, but there was no response. Knowing that something was wrong, he reported to the accounting room and pried open the door. He saw Li lying on the bed, spitting blood, and had already died. There was a glass bottle on the table. He immediately reported to the police station and ordered the detectives to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy office. The prosecutor of the Second Special Court arrived at the office and determined that the body had committed suicide by taking poison. Because there were no family members, the hall placed the coffin for burial and waited for family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Yan Gengsheng Convicted of Lewd Behavior</h3>
<p>丨Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment丨</p>
<p>Gu Fushun, a 14-year-old child from Zhenjiang residing in Pudong, came to Shanghai from Pu to Qing'anli, Zhaofeng Road, to look for his mother on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 7:30. Not familiar with the way, he wandered around Dongyouheng Road. Yan Gengsheng, a 26-year-old man from Hangzhou, was idly watching at a nearby bookstore. Gu asked him for information about the location of Qing'anli. Yan, seeing his handsome appearance, suddenly had evil intentions and falsely claimed to know it. He then went with him to the Yijia countryside on Tianbao Road, Zhabei, and asked him to go in for dinner. The child refused. Yan immediately tricked him into a black alley in Zhongnanli, Zhaofeng Road, took off his pants and knocked Gu to the ground, and practiced sodomy. The child shouted loudly, and Yan was afraid and tried to escape. At that time, a Chinese police officer No. 1944 was standing guard nearby and came to the scene after hearing the alarm. Gu told him the situation and arrested Yan and took him to the Huishan Police Station. The head of the police station ordered him to be detained. Gu was sent to Tongren Hospital for examination and found to have suffered minor injuries and could not be determined to have actually performed. Yesterday morning, Xiao Xie, judge of the First Special District Court, and Wang Zuze, chief prosecutor, came to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the past and said that the defendant admitted it in the police station. Now he filed a public prosecution according to Article 241, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for obscenity. Then, according to Gu's testimony, he questioned the defendant, who bowed his head without saying a word. The court asked Gu if his testimony was true and answered yes. The court ordered the debate to begin. Police lawyer Zhang said that there have been many cases of bestiality and sodomy recently, which have damaged social customs. Please punish the defendant severely to warn others from following suit. Judge Xiao then sentenced Yan Gengsheng to three years of imprisonment for obscene behavior towards a man under the age of sixteen as a warning.</p>

<h3>Standardization of Cigarette Exchange Industry and Uniform Pricing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Industry Association, in view of the sluggish business of the industry since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, and the resulting competition among members who were hanging up signs to sell at low prices, causing individual losses and harming the overall industry, convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. In addition to dispatching personnel from the two offices in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts to provide guidance and conduct thorough rectification, it was decided that three offices should be established in the concession areas. These offices have been established successively: the British Concession office is located inside Qian Taixin Cigarette Shop on Xin Zha Road, the American Concession office is located at No. 8, Long Ren Li, Ping Liang Road, and the French Concession office is located at No. 4, De Shun Li, Xi Xin Qiao. Each office is responsible for various tasks within its respective scope. The summer prices were evaluated and determined at a meeting on the 20th of this month, and a report was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. Price lists were printed and distributed to each shop, with a deadline of April 1st for implementation and compliance. A notice was also issued, stating: "Regarding the notice, it has been found that due to the large number of members in the association, inconsistent pricing has hindered business significantly. Therefore, the association has specifically stipulated a price list for stores, which has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and implementation. Recently, due to the soaring prices of foreign goods, the previously set price list is no longer applicable. Based on the current value of goods and foreign prices, the association has re-evaluated and categorized a new summer price list for stores, which is printed and distributed along with this notice. All members of the industry, whether members or non-members, should comply equally and should not create further disorder. If anyone continues to disobey overtly or covertly, or hangs up signs to sell at low prices, once discovered or reported, the association will, for the sake of maintaining the overall business, immediately formulate punishment and sanctions in accordance with Article 10 of the industry regulations, and submit a special report to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting the Public Security Bureau and the court to execute the punishment separately. Strict compliance is essential, and deliberate violation is not to be tolerated. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>The Way Out for China's Peasant Problems</h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Xu Shizhang from Pinghu |</p>
<p>Because I am agitated by my own thoughts, please forgive me for urgently raising the following question, and I hope you will not hesitate to instruct me. Last year, our countryside was considered a year of good harvest, with a yield of more than two stones of rice per mu, but the peasants are still as poor as ever. If we find ways to improve their farming methods, and assume that the yield has increased to three stones per mu, can the rural economy be considered completely solved at this time? If the answer is no, then is there another reason for the decline of the rural economy? In other words, no matter what the environment, as long as we strive to increase production, will the rural economy continue to develop upward? Furthermore, let us assume that the poverty of the peasants is actually due to multiple oppressions. Therefore, it is only natural that the peasants must seek other ways out of their current predicament. However, such heretical ideas (or so-called foreign bagu) seem to be unworthy of discussion in the eyes of the newly emerging intellectual class, so they have become the exclusive property of bandits. I am a commoner, how dare I lightly believe in this idea that is a hundred times more dangerous than explosives, but I am troubled by the above question and cannot get rid of it. Finally, let me make my meaning more clear: if increasing production is not an absolute panacea for saving the bankrupt rural economy (because the overproduction of American agriculture and industry is a well-known example), then please, in addition to increasing production, find a bright way out for our 380 million peasants, this is my only hope.</p>
<p>Answer: The bankruptcy of the countryside and the poverty of the peasants "are actually due to multiple oppressions." You have clearly pointed out the symptoms of China's rural economic disease with one word. We know that the poverty of Chinese peasants is due to the deep penetration of imperialist goods into the countryside; Chinese capitalism has gradually penetrated into the countryside; we also know that Chinese peasants are oppressed by usury and exploited by exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, coupled with mechanized farming, which has been adopted in many areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, small farmers go bankrupt, mergers are becoming more intense, and peasants produce entirely for commodities. In short, the countryside is exploited by the city, and China is exploited by imperialists. The most urgent problem for peasants now is the land problem, and this problem can no longer be solved by the slogan "land to the tiller"! This is a fact that probably no one can deny. Grasp the current facts and grasp the current relationships, then you should not find it difficult to find a bright path for how to solve the current rural problems.</p>

<h3>Lifeline</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The new aggressive term invented by the Japanese is called lifeline. Having declared Manchuria as their lifeline, they now claim that the Pacific islands entrusted to the League of Nations are Japan's maritime lifeline.</p>
<p>They easily seized the land lifeline from the hands of the non-resistant generals. As for the maritime lifeline, they are planning to implement their "renting farmland as self-produced" plan; however, the islands are old possessions of Germany, and recently, the Germans have paid very close attention to the fate of the islands. It seems that this maritime lifeline will not be as easy to obtain as the land lifeline.</p>
<p>Everyone has a lifeline. Why is the Japanese lifeline not on themselves but on others? May I ask, before their power had swelled to Manchuria, and before they had obtained the trusteeship of the Pacific islands, were they lifeless? May I ask, would a lifeless country have survived to this day?</p>
<p>The lifeline expands with their desires. Having land and sea lifelines, of course, they must also have an air lifeline; only considering the Pacific islands and the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe as land and sea lifelines is still a very polite minimum. According to the thoughts in their cluttered stomachs, they may say that the five oceans are their maritime lifeline, the five continents are their land lifeline, and the sky around the earth is their air lifeline, so that the lifeline is concentrated in one country, and the Japanese can express their satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, the desires of aggressors are never satisfied. I am afraid their lifeline will extend to other planets.</p>
<h3>Waste Paper, Old Iron</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>| Tears and dust cannot be sold |</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the Japanese were buying waste paper from the wastepaper baskets of Chinese agencies. These days, the newspaper reported that the Japanese were buying old iron from various places. Respect, respect, the Japanese are comrades in the business of picking up old goods.</p>
<p>Some people say that the Japanese are clever ghosts, and "utilizing waste" is their forte. Buying waste paper from Chinese agencies is aimed at finding a page or two of "policy for recovering lost territory," or "complete plan for resisting Japan," or "consistent diplomatic policy" from the pile of waste paper, to expose the iron evidence of China's aggressive ambitions. Buying old iron from various places is to make small pot-like military caps, or to make guns and cannons, and distribute them to every Japanese to monitor every citizen of Manchukuo, or to prepare to cast iron statues for the founding heroes of Manchukuo such as Honjo Shigeru, Doihara Kenji, and Muto Nobuyoshi. In our view, these things are indeed waste, but the Japanese have taken them away and it seems like they have unintentionally opened a mine. Take Puyi for example. After falling from the dragon throne, didn't he already become a piece of waste worth half a cent? Who knew that Doihara, the old brother who picks up old goods, would pick him up in Changchun, dress him up, and he would actually become a powerful regent. Isn't the Japanese ability to utilize waste higher than thirty-three days away?</p>
<p>I say, in this case, I will not starve to death. As the saying goes, "Poor as I am, there are still three loads of copper at home." Having three loads of copper hidden at home is originally not considered poor, but because no one buys it, I am poor. Now it's good, even old iron and waste paper can be sold for money. Then, the snot and tears in the spittoon may also be secretly bought at a high price by treacherous traitors to supply the enemy who is good at utilizing waste to make "tear gas," and the dust and garbage in the corner of the door can also be used by the enemy to make "smoke bombs," not to mention the three loads of copper.</p>
<p>However, it is a small matter to starve to death, but it is a big matter to lose integrity. Although I am poor, I will never use "tears" or "dust" to aid the enemy. This can be sworn.</p>
<h3>The Manchu Ethnic Group's Republic of China Official</h3>
<p>Japan created a puppet state, saying it was national self-determination. The Lytton Report and the League of Nations General Assembly report both have clear rebuttals stating that the establishment of the puppet state was due to the presence of Japanese troops and officials, and not out of the voluntary will of the local people. The League of Nations General Assembly report further stated that among the 30 million people in the three northeastern provinces, the Manchu ethnic group accounted for a very small number, and this small number of Manchus had been assimilated into the Han. The development of various places in the three northeastern provinces was no different from that of the provinces within the pass. The saying of national self-determination is fundamentally slanderous. The League of Nations believes that this has already refuted Japan; in fact, there are other facts that can be refuted! It is very strange that this matter can make Japan unable to argue, but it is a very glorious thing in the Republic of China. Not only did the League of Nations not notice it, but even our Chinese people have overlooked it very much. Few people have ever talked about it! This is because there is still a true Manchu in Guanwai who has always been loyal to the Republic of China. His position is the same as that of Xi Qia; his situation is also the same after the September 18th Incident; but his thoughts, personality, and actions are absolutely opposite. To this day, he still maintains a part of the land for the Republic of China. Japan says it is the national self-determination of the Manchu ethnic group. In fact, the only 10 million Manchus are no longer in Manchuria, and those who are truly in Manchuria are limited; among the limited ones, there is a Republic of China official from the Manchu ethnic group like Cheng Yun, who has always held a clear banner of supporting the Republic of China, opposing Japan, and opposing the puppet state. How should Japan explain this? (Yi)</p>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 3: Ultimately failing to untie the bell and entering the wrong door, secretly pitying the young girl's corner and willing to share food.</p>
<p>When he walked out of the gate, he had a very heavy look of anger on his face, thinking that when he returned home, he would definitely interrogate the servant severely. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped out of the gate, the anger disappeared, and he was shocked, and his face immediately turned pale. It turned out that his elder brother Houzhi was standing with his hands behind his back at his own gate, looking in this direction. His brother had clearly seen him coming out of the Yang family's gate, so there was no way to deny it. He had no choice but to lower his head, walk to his own gate, and slip in sideways. When he walked out of Guizhi's room, Guizhi saw his embarrassed appearance and thought to herself that no matter what the servant had said wrong, Jizhi did not know. She herself was being unreasonable in getting angry with Jizhi. Moreover, seeing Jizhi walking out dejectedly, it must have been because he had heard some words and was resentful in his heart. So she quietly followed behind, intending to say a few polite words to Jizhi and calm his anger. Unexpectedly, he did not follow out, but that was not a big deal. As soon as he followed out, Houzhi happened to see them together, which was ironclad proof that the two of them were on good terms. Guizhi stood at the gate and stretched her head to look at the Gan family's gate. When she stretched her head to look over there, Houzhi also opened his eyes and looked in this direction. Houzhi was angry, and Guizhi could not help but be angry when she saw the Yang family's gate. Therefore, they looked at each other angrily, each with their own anger. Guizhi saw this and immediately shrank back, and she even heard Houzhi saying loudly, "I saw it with my own eyes, what else do you have to say?" Jizhi's reply was very low, and she could not hear what he said. Continuing, she heard Houzhi shouting, "You are talking nonsense. I knew this morning that you had been to the Yang family. Now you are coming out of there again, running back and forth two or three times a day. What exactly are you doing? I would like to ask you." After saying these words, the sound became more and more distant, presumably because they had both gone into the house. Hearing this, Guizhi understood a little in her heart that Houzhi was disgusted that his brother should not be friends with a poor girl. If he continued to associate with her, his brothers would inevitably fall out. She had wrongly blamed Jizhi. However, it was really shameful to be looked down upon by officials like this. From now on, there was no need to meet Gan Er Lord. (28)</p>
<h3>News Under the Hammer</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>| Also a barometer of the times |</p>
<p>Have you ever been to the exchange to gamble on winning or losing; or to sightsee? You always see a lot of people gathered in the arena, stretching out their hands; raising their voices, some shouting to buy in; some shouting to sell out. When the transaction between the two parties is completed, the auctioneer on the stage slams the hammer down, and the life and death of both parties are judged, and there is no way to go back. On the one hand, I secretly admire the authority of the auctioneer; on the other hand, I study where the focus of their transactions is? After inquiring, I realized that the small commercial field is also a barometer of the times.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the American bank went bankrupt. As soon as this news came, the price of gold in the exchange fell sharply. The people who bought in went pale; the people who sold out celebrated. You think that under this hammer, the life and death of the buying and selling parties are determined; but it is more related to the good and bad of the world's finances, so don't underestimate it!</p>
<p>These two days are not good again, our public bonds are falling in price again. Their fall has nothing to do with us not doing business. However, this fall is likely to cause problems, mostly due to the unstable situation in Tianjin. Unexpectedly, under the hammer, the safety and danger of the times will be judged.</p>
<p>"A halo around the moon means wind, and dampness means rain." The astronomers in the countryside use it as a standard, and it is always accurate. There is an astronomical observatory in the city to test the climate; ordinary people also have a barometer, which relies on mechanical power and is even more accurate. However, the good and bad of the times cannot be tested by any machinery. Now I have invented something, which is the hammer in this exchange.</p>
<h3>Seamstress for the Poor</h3>
<p>— Daosheng</p>
<p>Every day, an old woman squats on a pile of broken bricks at the corner of the road, wearing old reading glasses on her wrinkled face, a blue cloth jacket, and a pair of small feet exposed under a green cloth apron. Beside her is a bamboo basket, hidden in the basket are scraps of cloth, sock bottoms, and yarn, and sometimes some dry food. She spends the whole day sewing sock bottoms, mending clothes, and adding buttons for people under her dizzy and trembling hands, busy, earning a little bit of profit. She is a seamstress for the poor that is looked down upon by the general public.</p>
<p>The seamstress for the poor is old, works hard, and earns little money. Logically, she should be sad about her fate, but she always smiles and shows a satisfied look, never sighing or exclaiming.</p>
<p>Her son pulls a rickshaw, her daughter-in-law works, and her grandson picks coal and collects old goods. Everyone has a small thing to do, and everyone has a little income. Although the income is small, the expenses are also small. Although the life is not as comfortable as the rich, there is no fear of going hungry. The family is harmonious and happy, and no one is as content and happy as they are.</p>
<p>Her son sometimes pulls the rickshaw and happens to pass that corner of the road, he will loudly call "Mom" a few times. At this time, she will temporarily stop working, and her kind eyes will penetrate through the old reading glasses to greet her son. Sometimes, her grandson carries a bamboo basket and walks up to her, asking her for a copper coin to buy candy, or searching for the dry food hidden in her cloth basket. She always complies with the child's request without reproach, always smiling.</p>

<h3>A Corner of Beijing City</h3>
<p>— Shi Xingji</p>
<p>| A quick sketch of the interior of the Confucius Temple |</p>
<p>"Tiger, tiger, ... African python!" People coming and going hiss, pointing to the graphics on the cloth tent, a pair of huge tigers and a python, almost twice the size of a human body. Fortunately, it doesn't cost much to spend more than a dozen copper coins to broaden your horizons, which is worth it. So, one person after another goes in, and one person after another comes out. The ones going in are excited, but the ones coming out shake their heads in annoyance, "A pair of wildcats and a water snake!" they spit out from the mouths of those who have visited. But the person standing in front of the door is still "Tiger, tiger, ... African python!" constantly hissing, and there are still people going in one after another.</p>
<p>"Magic magic is really wonderful, just like ghosts and gods and immortals." That's right, the skills are indeed agile, but you shouldn't brag yourself. If you want to say that it is true, just ask this question: "If the magic is real, then you can sit at home and enjoy yourself. If you want to eat, you can take delicacies from the mountains and seas out of thin air; if you want to wear, ... why bother begging here?" See what reason they have to refute? In this corner, they can get the praise and amazement of the general public!</p>
<p>The voice is already hoarse, and the drum sound is not in sync, which is quite embarrassing. But in low-level society, it seems to be a supreme enjoyment, a nectar obtained in withering! Often, when it comes to a tense moment, they start to sell off, suddenly pausing, and trying their best to collect the money from everyone's pockets.</p>
<p>The surface is polished brightly, looking like it is brand new, whether it is leather shoes, cups, bowls, glasses, fountain pens, ... the surface is washed clean, without flaws, like clothes, shoes, and hats, ... In fact, the goods sold here are all old! Or unreal. The asking price is as expensive as good goods. The smart ones turn around and leave, and they have to wait for them to call them back before they can negotiate the price. At least half the original price is required to avoid being fooled.</p>
<p>The sellers of herb cakes and wandering doctors say: "We sell precious medicines at low prices. This is to accumulate merits on the other hand (?)." Whitening tooth powder, stain-removing soap, chemical magnet-repairing glue, ... They can test the effectiveness on the spot, but it is impossible to guarantee it for a long time.</p>
<p>Beef, pancakes, ... the smell permeates the space. Everyone's nostrils are different. Some feel it is fragrant, and some feel it is smelly. Whether it is fragrant or smelly, there are always many people who eat it, so there is no need to reject it.</p>
<p>There are very few gentlemen who come here. There are workers, soldiers, clerks, hooligans, pickpockets, ... bustling and bustling. It can increase on Sundays.</p>
<p>"Looking at this hexagram, your luck this year is not bad; unfortunately, ..." What Emei Mountain people, also immortals, Zhang Tieguai, not afraid of poverty, ... and the like, face readers, fortune tellers, and word analysts.</p>
<p>"Dang dang dang ..." The sound of a clear chime occasionally reaches the ears, undoubtedly there is a school here. From the giggling laughter, one can also know that the school here is a small paradise. The door is tightly closed, probably to prevent the young children from following the environment.</p>
<p>In this corner, you can also see the alarming words in the hands of newspaper vendors, impressing them on your eyelids. Those who are illiterate can learn one or two from the newspaper vendors' mouths that "we are fighting the Japanese devils!".</p>
<p>Around this corner, there are tall and magnificent teahouses and restaurants, amusement parks, cinemas, ... the luxury of enjoyment is several times higher than here, and the price is also several times higher than here.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy, frivolity, ... are fully expressed here, and it is also a portrait gallery of low-level society.</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Announces Fifty Guidelines for County Magistrates in Running Schools</h3>
<p>For Reference by the Directors of Education Bureaus</p>
<p>(A) Educational Administration (1) County magistrates should strictly adhere to current educational laws and regulations when running schools. (2) Personnel should be employed based on talent, with the enterprise as the premise, and should not be swayed by personal preferences or interests. (3) Educational administrative personnel and affiliated educational institutions should be assessed and supervised at any time, and rewards and punishments should be recommended separately. (4) When planning the development of educational undertakings in the county, they must absolutely bear the responsibility of increasing and ensuring funding. (5) Educational disputes should be handled impartially, promptly, and responsibly. (6) All official documents forwarded downwards should be supervised for implementation, and official documents forwarded upwards should be audited responsibly. (7) Matters ordered to be completed within a time limit should be completed on time and should not be delayed. (8) Formulate central tasks for each period as a guideline for progress. (Counties that have already abolished the Education Bureau should pay particular attention.) (9) Strictly order superintendents and education committee members to conduct careful inspections or secret investigations, and report the inspection status on schedule. (10) Supervise the county education associations to actively engage in research, eliminate factional disputes.</p>
<p>(B) Educational Funding (11) Guarantee the independence of educational funding, as clearly stated in the party program. Under no circumstances should it be encroached upon or borrowed. (12) Educational funds accumulated as reserves should be used for disaster relief and should not be transferred to the normal expenses of educational undertakings. (13) Educational undertakings should be promoted year by year, and educational funding must be increased year by year. It is unacceptable to be inattentive simply because there was some accumulation in the past. (14) The allocation of educational funding must take into account the two principles of "balance" and "economy," and vigorously eliminate the long-standing abuses of fake receipts and extravagant expenditures. (15) Prepare a budget before the beginning of the year and a final account at the end of the year, which must be submitted for review and approval on time in accordance with the law. Educational expenditures must also strictly follow the budget (refer to the "Detailed Rules for the Compilation of Educational Funding Budgets in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province" and the "Detailed Rules for the Compilation of Educational Funding Final Accounts in Various Counties," see pages 273 to 292 of the "Compilation of Current Educational Laws and Regulations of Jiangsu Province"). (16) If any county has outstanding educational fees, it should immediately distinguish between new and old arrears, find ways to clear them up, and participate in the "Methods for Clearing Educational Funding Arrears Before the Eighteenth Year in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province" and the "Supplementary Methods for Clearing Old Arrears in Various Counties" (see pages 296 to 298 of the Compilation of Laws and Regulations). (17) Thoroughly eliminate the long-standing abuses of tax collection. Strict tracking and collection of educational donations and taxes must be enforced, and they must be allocated on time. Corrupt tax collectors must be severely punished. (18) The distribution of educational funds must be the same in urban and rural areas, without any preference or discrimination. (19) Miscellaneous donations in various counties are complex, so they must be quickly and thoroughly rectified to ensure that every penny goes to the public. (20) The school properties of various counties should be thoroughly and fundamentally cleared up, so that funds and properties are concentrated, property rights are consolidated, and all kinds of abuses are eliminated. (21) Pay attention to the custody and use of the primary education land donation. (22) Supervise the directors of the education bureaus to handle the handover and be responsible for the supervision and calculation. (23) Economic transparency is paramount, with auditing as the first priority. Each county must establish an Educational Funding Audit Committee and a Regional Audit Committee every year, and implement periodic audits, submit reports and announcements, in accordance with the "Brief Regulations of the Educational Funding Audit Committee of the Education Bureau of Each County in Jiangsu Province" and the "Brief Regulations of the Regional Educational Funding Audit Committee of Each County" (see pages 293 to 295 of the Compilation of Laws and Regulations).</p>

<p>And Telegraph the Central Government to Sternly Order Counterattacks to Recover Lost Territories</p>
<p>The University Teachers' Associations of this city held their second standing committee meeting yesterday at 2 PM on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. They passed a telegram to the whole country opposing compromise with Japan and the signing of a peace treaty, and telegraphed the central government, sternly ordering the generals at the front to actively launch counterattacks to recover the lost territories. Details of the meeting and the full text of the two telegrams are recorded below:</p>

<p>(Oppose Compromise) For the attention of all national organizations, schools, legal entities, and newspapers: The loss of the Northeast and the fall of Rehe have brought untold suffering to our compatriots in four provinces. The pain of national subjugation is beyond compare. The Association, after careful consideration, resolutely insists that negotiations are impossible unless the lost territories are recovered. Therefore, it has been resolved by the general meeting of all members of the Association that no humiliating treaty should be signed with the enemy until the lost territories in the Northeast are recovered. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the united efforts of all compatriots to overcome national difficulties, and to urge the government to devote all its efforts to plan an active counterattack strategy to recover the lost territories. Anyone who dares to violate this principle and compromise with the enemy will be regarded as a national enemy. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration. The University Teachers' Associations of Shanghai. (Imprint)</p>
<p>(Telegram Requesting Counterattack) Respectfully addressed to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: Since the September 18th Incident, the violent Japanese have made progress step by step. Our country lacks concrete plans, resulting in the loss of the three provinces, and now Rehe has also fallen. We are always in a passive position, without an active strategy. Learning from the past and feeling the pain, the only plan for now is for the Central Government to sternly order the generals at the front to plan in detail an active counterattack strategy, and to gather the national elite, enrich all military preparations, and fight the enemy with our backs to the wall. We urge you to hold a firm will, inspire ardent courage, issue magnificent aspirations, and embrace the greatest determination. Do not be confined to a corner of the world, and do not harbor thoughts of temporary peace. Take the country and the nation as the top priority, awaken suddenly, unite as one, pool our wisdom and efforts, protect our homeland, and succeed or fail, the benefits or harm, all depends on this one action. This telegram is respectfully submitted, hoping for your consideration. The University Teachers' Associations of Shanghai. (Imprint)</p>

<p>▲ Representatives from the National Government and the Three Departments of Railways, Education, and Industry Attend</p>
<p>▲ Rich Displays and Perfect Layouts Attract a Steady Stream of Visitors</p>
<p>The 37th Anniversary of National Jiaotong University and the opening ceremony of the Industrial Railway Exhibition were held yesterday morning. Representatives from the National Government and the three ministries of Railways, Education, and Industry, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department, attended. The opening of the Engineering Hall and the dedication of Rong Hong Hall were held simultaneously. This afternoon, there will be performances and entertainment. The exhibition has many displays and a perfect layout. Details of the grand occasion are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Overview of the Venue The entrance to the university on Anhe Road leads to the Engineering Hall, which displays industrial machinery. The most noteworthy items include the car made by the Liaoning Minsheng Factory, the Jiangfeng aircraft made by the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, the generator from the New China Company, and the domestically made motor from the Huasheng Electric Company. The ground floor of the Engineering Hall is divided into four areas: (A) Electrical Testing Laboratory, (B) Mechanical Testing Laboratory, (C) Materials Testing Laboratory, (D) Ford Motor Company, Belgian Silver Company's light railway. The upper floor features machinery, cosmetics, instruments, paints, telephones, and toys from various Chinese and foreign factories. Further inside is the university's Upper House, which features the Railway Exhibition, divided into five areas: national railway models, roadside scenery, Cao'e River Railway Bridge, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo 31st Bridge model. The gymnasium on the side of the Upper House displays the university's achievements, divided into a reception room, an administrative and sports exhibition of the university, a billiards room, and an achievements exhibition. The South Dormitory is the Road City Exhibition, with the ground floor divided into a Road City Chart Display Room, a Domestic Road City Book Display Room, and an International Road City Display Room. The upper floor features scenic photographs and charts. In addition, the Upper House also has the Shanghai Municipal Government Exhibition Room and the Four Banks Savings Society Exhibition Room, with two large models of the Municipal Government Finance Bureau, one large model of Shanghai, and photos, etc. Inside the venue, the Jiaotong University Small Railway Bureau operates a small train for visitors to ride and tour, charging 20 cents per person. Lianhua Company is in charge of photography for the event, and Asia-America Company is broadcasting.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives and Guests Starting from 9 AM, consuls from various countries, government representatives, representatives from various schools, and Chinese and foreign guests arrived one after another to visit the campus and attend various ceremonies. These included German Deputy Consul General Bai Rende, Vice Consul Moore, Swedish Consul General Lalan, representatives from the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, representative from the Ministry of Railways Gu Minister Xia Guangyu, representative from the Ministry of Industry Liu Yinbo, representative from the Ministry of Education Zhu Minister Wu Shuwei, former Vice Minister of Industry Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau Xu Peihuang, representative from the Jiangsu Provincial Government Xu Xingcheng, representative from the Songhu Garrison Command Xu Yiheng, Staff Officer of the Naval Training Fleet Wu Guanghai, representative from the Public Security Bureau Huang Zune, Zeng Zhaoyi from the Beiping Railway Administration, Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Two Roads Traffic Department, Fan Shouzhu from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, Cheng Kaogang from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, Chu Fucheng from Shanghai Law School, Liu Qifeng from Nanjing Central University, and Weng Zilong from Tongji University, among hundreds of others.</p>
<p>▲ Opening of the Engineering Hall The opening ceremony of the Engineering Hall was held at 9 AM in front of the Engineering Hall. First, President Li reported, stating that the construction of the Engineering Hall was proposed in the fifteenth year of the Republic, but only over 30,000 yuan was raised for construction costs. It was delayed until the nineteenth year when Sun Zhesheng, Minister of Railways, took over as president of the university. He was enthusiastic about industrial construction, and the old proposal was revived and actively implemented. Construction began in February of the twentieth year and was completed at the end of the year. The entire hall occupies an area of 4,200 square feet and a volume of 42,000 cubic feet. It is divided into two floors, with the lower floor being a laboratory and factory, and the upper floor being a research, surveying, and teaching room. If expansion is needed in the future, another floor can be added on top, as this was prepared for during the design and construction. After the report, architect Wu presented the key and wished for engineering progress and industrial development. President Hu received the key. After opening it, President Zhang continued to speak, saying that the museum was completed through the efforts of President Li, which he was deeply pleased about. Recalling the beginning of the university's establishment, it focused on civil engineering, but all the equipment was very simple. Two or three years later, a flat roof was added to the original electrical plant and instruments were added, which was the beginning of the Electrical Engineering Hall. Various equipment has been added over the decades, but it is very different from today. However, the graduates who have served in government agencies, working in electrical administration and transportation, or who have started their own businesses with their own experience, have all achieved remarkable results. In this exhibition, the diesel engine of the New China Engineering Company, the transformer of the Yizhong Electric Company, and the radio equipment of the Wireless Radio Research Company and the Three Pole Sharp Electric Company are all the result of the efforts of the university's students. Now that we have such excellent equipment, we should naturally work harder. The Grams Research Institute in England built a laboratory, and in 1915, Watt's steam engine was invented, which is the ancestor of today's power. The Royal School in England built the Davis Laboratory, which led to Faraday's electromagnetic induction invention in 1831. Therefore, he has endless hope for the completion of the Engineering Hall.</p>

<p>▲ Dedication of Rong Hong Hall The dedication ceremony of Rong Hong Hall was held at 9:30 AM in front of Rong Hong Hall. First, President Zhong reported that the university's curriculum has increased over the years, and the number of students has also increased, resulting in insufficient school buildings. When Mr. Sun served as president of the university, he had a five-year and ten-year plan, and the construction of Rong Hong Hall was also part of the plan. Tenders were solicited in July of last year, bids were opened in August, and construction began in September, and was completed in March of this year. The entire hall occupies an area of 1,949 square feet and has three floors for the use of the administrative office. After the report, architect Zhuang presented the key and wished for the development of the school and the prosperity of the country. Engineer Rong received the key and opened it. Then President Li gave a speech, saying that the construction of this hall is to commemorate the sage Rong Hong, so it is not only a material memorial, but also a good lesson in spirit. A hundred years ago, Mr. Rong advocated reform and made ten suggestions to Li Hongzhang. The establishment of this school is also due to this. At that time, 120 students were sent to study abroad, and in the past few decades, they have made great contributions to the revitalized China. Mr. Hong's vision and advocacy are all premised on patriotism. We built this Rong Hong Hall to commemorate him and hope that the students will work hard to complete his unfinished aspirations.</p>
<p>▲ Opening of the Exhibition The opening ceremony of the Industrial Railway Exhibition was held at the Wen Zhi Hall at 10 AM. First, Director of Preparation Hu Duanxing reported that the university has had two large-scale exhibitions. The first was in the fifth year of the Republic when the university celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the second was when the university celebrated its 30th anniversary. The 35th anniversary of the university two years ago was the preparation for the opening of the Industrial Railway Exhibition, but it was postponed due to the "September 18th" and "January 28th" national disasters. At the end of last year, preparations were started again, and after many meetings in April, it was finally opened, which is gratifying. The exhibition is also divided into two types: Type A is donated by various parties, and Type B is for display. The exhibitors include 12 railways, 60 factories, 9 schools, and 6 institutions. Foreign factories include 33 from England, 28 from Germany, 26 from Belgium, 14 from the United States, 14 from Switzerland, 7 from France, 4 from Italy, 3 from Canada, and 1 each from Sweden, Hungary, Denmark, Russia, and the Netherlands. Xia Guangyu, representative of Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways, gave a speech, saying that Jiaotong University is well-managed and has perfect equipment. Through the expansion and improvement of successive presidents, the talents it has produced have all served in society with excellent results. Therefore, it occupies an important position in the process of building a new China. The significance of the Industrial Railway Exhibition is also very important: (1) It provides an opportunity for the study of academic theory and the needs of practice to be explored, and it can also be a comparison of domestic and foreign industries. (2) It arouses the attention of the Chinese people to industry. In today's country, if we want to survive, we must strive for construction. Therefore, the strength of the country depends on the thickness of the national production force. Since the rise of the machine industry, the handicraft industry has been declining, and our country still does not pay attention to the construction of industry. This is also an important reason for the daily weakening of the country's power. Moreover, although various raw materials can be produced by ourselves, we cannot manufacture industrial iron. The purpose of the Industrial Railway Exhibition is to promote the attention of the Chinese people. In this period of national crisis, it is even more important. Yu Hongjun, representative of the National Government and the Municipal Government, gave a speech, saying that Jiaotong University has a glorious history and great achievements, and has made great contributions to new construction. Now, during the national crisis, holding the Industrial Railway Exhibition has important significance. One of the reasons for China's decline is the underdevelopment of industry, commerce, and transportation. The reason for the underdevelopment of industry is that the Chinese people do not pay attention to scientific management, and some even believe that it is possible to achieve development by focusing on household industry like England in the nineteenth century. President Sun Yat-sen's will is that capital is machines, which shows that without using machines for large-scale production, it is impossible to talk about industry. Therefore, in addition to making the Chinese people aware of machines, this exhibition also hopes to emphasize the significance of scientific management.

<p>China-England International Billiards Match</p>
<h3>China Wins Three, Loses One, Championship Within Reach Shen Lince Heavily Defeats Maxwell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Results: 1,000 Points to 757, Win of 243 Points</p>
<p>Four-Day Summary: China's Score Exceeds 610 Points</p>
<p>Tonight's Final Match: Our Country's Billiards King Li Gongying to Fight</p>
<p>Enemy General is British Veteran Bernard</p>
<p>Since the start of the first China-England International Billiards Match held in Shanghai, all the Chinese players have been doing their best to fight for national glory and personal honor. In the four days of fighting, they have won three and lost one. Summarizing the scores, China has already exceeded 610 points. The championship of this year is basically ours. Yesterday, Shen Lince performed brilliantly, making a lot of progress compared to previous years and winning 243 points. It took four and a half hours, and it ended in the middle of the night.</p>
<h3>Main General Comes to Challenge We Are Strong, You Are Weak Let's See Today</h3>
<p>Today is the final battle, and it is also one of the most exciting scenes. The two sides' main generals, our country's billiards king Li Gongying, will meet with the British veteran Bernard. Judging from the championship, China can steadily win. However, the strength of each individual's skills still needs to be determined in today's competition. In short, the competition between the best talents is intensely interesting. The effort of the contestants is unquestionable. The competition is divided into two sessions, at 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM in the evening, at the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Club inside the United China Building on Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>Art is Different, the Better One Will Win, It is Difficult to Escape the Public Law</h3>
<p>The difference between Shen Lince and Maxwell's victory or defeat lies in the difference in art. However, both of them firmly hold excellent points that are unmatched by ordinary people. Whenever they encounter difficult situations, they can handle them calmly. Knowing that their strength is not enough, they would rather sacrifice themselves than give the enemy a chance to advance. They can create their own situations and cut off the enemy's path. Mr. Shen relied on his more than 20 years of experience and had the magic of meeting needs from all directions. Maxwell also sighed inferior to him. The better one will win, which is the public law of natural selection.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Different, Advancing and Following, Shadows Following Each Other</h3>
<p>Not long after the start, Shen scored two shots with 65 points and then a 27, taking the lead with 123 to 45. From then on, Shen stood proudly in front. By the 30th shot, he had already won half (296 to 151). By the 44th shot, he was 69.5 points away from reaching 500. Not long after, he led with 500 to 296. After dinner, Shen continued to show his talent and control the overall situation. From the 61st to the 70th shot, he scored a total of 226 points within ten shots, including five consecutive shots with 32, 65, 20, 26, and 23 points. At that time, Maxwell also made great efforts and scored several large amounts of 37 and 35, but it was not enough to offset the losses and he was in an irreparable situation. Finally, Maxwell added numbers like 31 and 28, but it did not help the overall situation. Seeing Shen again get scores like 24, 21, and 30 several times, he won the victory and left.</p>

<h3>Escaping the Death Line</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Several intellectuals gathered together, often looking at each other and sighing, "Boring! Boring!" Is life really that boring? Is it really the end of the century now?</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the individualistic sense of life and the tendency to enjoy decay among intellectuals have become increasingly strong. Its color is like the sunset glow, extremely stimulating, but dusk is near, and it will soon die. Where does this consciousness come from? Her womb is the "small family" that intellectuals are attached to. Modern young men and women have escaped from large families and from patriarchal societies; but they do not go to society to be social people; they hide in small families, isolated from society, and gradually become isolated individuals.</p>
<p>People must be social people, so that life has meaning and survival has value. Becoming an isolated individual is an opportunity for primitive animality to raise its head. A one-up-one-down alley house, living room, kitchen shed, front building, pavilion room, houses four or five families; in fact, it is not four or five families, but four or five countries, not asking each other, not interacting, that old saying of "watching and helping each other, supporting each other in sickness," no one cares about it anymore. Each family brings the habits of their hometown and gets along with a cold, sarcastic, and "hateful" attitude, constantly living through beating chickens and scolding dogs. Young people growing up in alley societies have no society, no family, only the unique individual. The so-called Shanghai petty bourgeoisie are this kind of purely individualistic youth. Their spiritual focus is best performed by the big hotel life. The magnificent and tall buildings are decorated very luxuriously, and the petty bourgeoisie are inside, playing cards, smoking opium, calling for girls, in one room, reckless and unruly, no one can control anyone, so that perverted sexuality, perverted materialism, are intricately arising; rape, miscegenation, speculation, adventure, like a shot of morphine, only stimulation can encourage intention, and perversion becomes normal!</p>
<p>The "boredom" shouted by intellectuals is the "emptiness" after intense enjoyment; like waking up from a drunken stupor, the limbs are numb, the tongue is bitter, the eyes are blurred, what else can be of interest? This is the death line near the ruins of the tomb. If we do not want to be buried there, we must summon the courage to escape from the death line! In other words: we must step out of the small family (not return to the large family), go to society, and be a dignified "social person"!</p>
<p>Individual strength is fragile, powerless, and prone to pessimism; becoming a social person makes strength stronger! Everything can be optimistic! Now is the period for young people to develop upward, life is not "boring", why sigh!</p>
<h3>National Salvation Donation</h3>
<p>— Blood Oath</p>
<p>At a "national salvation" rally, someone on the podium said慷慨激昂: "The national crisis is at hand, and the storm in the Pacific is coming like a landslide. Students, wake up"! He stamped his foot, waved his hand, and was quite "weepy." Then, the national salvation proposal was: "Everyone can save on food and build a gym, which is very good. Now, please save some money on snacks to make a national salvation donation. Three meals are enough..."</p>
<p>"Sir, cigarettes can also be given up." I don't know whose voice it was, very low, but very clear, everyone could hear it.</p>
<p>"Um, yes, I quit for three weeks during the Jinan Massacre, indeed, three weeks! But..."</p>
<p>"Is the heat as subtle as the spark of a cigarette butt"?</p>
<p>Apparently, the person on the stage was very unhappy.</p>
<p>"But, things are not absolute, so I'm not telling you not to eat snacks, I'm just saying eat less, just like me... brother smoking..."</p>
<p>"Why not be thorough"!</p>
<p>The person on the stage got annoyed, waved his hand, and called for the meeting to be dismissed.</p>
<p>The girls涌出 poured out of the auditorium like a hive of bees, some pouting, some laughing.</p>
<p>"What national salvation donation, are a few copper coins enough to buy a plane? And who knows what they buy planes for"?</p>
<p>"Who cares? Live one day, count as one day! Doesn't "Hall Order" tell us to study with peace of mind? Now they say we have to "save the country," what should we do"?</p>
<p>Silence, a moment of silence...</p>
<p>"I'm going to ask Ying to buy me a roll of film, in the spring, I should keep more young shadows." Qiao shifted the direction of the conversation, smiled, looked at the sky, the white clouds in the sky floated slowly, and Qiao's soul also floated slowly with the white clouds.</p>
<p>"Xiao Cheng is sure to have a quick letter today, this guy, recognizing himself as a brave warrior, is still learning to call me a beautiful bird with "struggle"." The delicate Na also calculated alone, seeming to boast of the glory of being called Queen.</p>
<p>The table was full of scattered era pictorials, movie magazines, with fashion, with charming smiles, with the legs of dancers, with the heroic posture of athletes... and a few photos of the arduous battles of the volunteer army that no one was willing to listen to.</p>
<p>"Min, this leg is so smooth, like yours"! Soft laughter.</p>
<p>"Your legs are more charming than hers"! Min smiled, winking.</p>
<p>"I heard that the movie emperor and the amorous widow are married, it's unfair, how can she be worthy of him! We have to write a letter to scold"! The spirit was as good as if she had taken morphine, and she was looking for letter paper.</p>
<p>"Okay, Qin, Zhen, already wrote a letter, telling the movie emperor to divorce her."</p>
<p>Laughter, everyone was laughing.</p>
<p>That gentleman on the stage came again, his face flushed, carrying the classics of "national salvation" and "reading," one sentence was: "You can also talk about saving the country while smoking opium."</p>
<p>"Yes, you can also save the country by dancing"!</p>
<p>"You can also save the country by having love affairs and dressing up"!</p>
<p>"There are many ways to save the country"!</p>
<p>Responding, everyone responded, and the girls' hearts immediately felt very relaxed.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall</h3>
<p>— Qiu Weng</p>
<p>One night, upon the invitation of a friend, I visited a newly opened dance hall for the first time.</p>
<p>The term "dance hall," so alluring, was something I was accustomed to seeing and hearing about, but this visit to a dance hall was truly my "first time ever." Therefore, as my foot stepped through the outer door of the dance hall, I immediately felt the red and green electric lights hanging on the branches and artificial mountains winking and mocking me, an unfamiliar patron.</p>
<p>Once seated, the waiter brought the Western pastries we ordered, and I began to shift my astonished eyes, gazing around at everything.</p>
<p>Red, green, purple, and all sorts of colored electric lights flickered alternately around the dance hall. The musicians played jubilant tunes, soft and fragrant, like the whispers of lovers, or the wild songs of youthful boys and girls. The dance hall was thus decorated into a lively and colorful "human paradise."</p>
<p>The dancers sat around the dance floor, white powder, red rouge, slender eyebrows, curled hair, alluring eyes, and the trembling flesh vaguely visible beneath long cheongsams—these were the dancers, like "celestial beings," waiting for devoted worship, or like "commodities," waiting for discerning customers. From a group of unnatural smiles, I vaguely heard the sound of tears falling silently.</p>
<p>The dance patrons, of course, were all in elegant Western suits, pristine white collars, shiny leather shoes, and slicked-back hair. Each person's eyes radiated a greedy light, searching for a desirable captive, searching for a plump lamb.</p>
<p>The music began, the electric lights changing into mysterious and seductive colors, and then couples, two couples,... began to embrace, tightly, on the smooth floor, swaying to the soft music, entwined like fighting demons. Flesh trembled, hearts leaped, the dance patrons laughed, triumphantly, and the dancers also laughed, triumphantly. "Captives," who were the captives? Everyone! This world was small, filled only with flesh, money, and deceitful laughter.</p>
<p>The music stopped abruptly, and the embracing couples casually dispersed.</p>
<p>Thus, I experienced the dance hall for the first time—a human paradise, a dark hell!</p>
<h3>What Every Dramatist Must Read</h3>
<p>— Ming Yi</p>
<p>Xiong Foxi, who sits on a wicker chair expounding on peasant drama (as seen in a certain issue of the Da Mei Evening News), is said to have specialized in drama studies in America. Therefore, the remarks of this drama expert are naturally worthy of our attention, especially for those in the drama community.</p>
<p>Thus, in the drama special issue of the ×× Monthly published in Nanjing, I am afraid that the public will not be able to "fully understand" Mr. Xiong's "Precepts and Beliefs." I have specially borrowed the space of "Free Talk" to extract and record them to spread them widely. Each precept is accompanied by brief annotations to help readers understand:</p>
<p>Do not write plays with more than ten characters. Do not write plays with more than two female characters. (Note: It is said that Xiong's followers only number four or five people in the drama department of the art institute, and among them, only one, Ms. Gu, is said to be female.)</p>
<p>Do not write about murder or marriage. (Note: Xiong's "Drunk" only has someone chasing people with a knife, presumably without actually committing murder.)</p>
<p>Do not allow mistresses or prostitutes to appear in my scripts. (Note: Xiong is an upper-class gentleman. Prostitutes and mistresses are too low and should not appear in noble dramas, as it would detract from the dignity of a gentleman.)</p>
<p>Do not participate in variety shows. (Note: Variety shows have vulgar leg dances, which undermine the true value of drama.)</p>
<p>Do not fall in love with actresses. (Note: If you fall in love with an actress, someone is bound to be jealous, or perhaps if the love is unsuccessful, the play cannot be performed.)</p>
<p>Do not defecate or urinate backstage.</p>
<p>(Note: If you happen to have diarrhea, you have to carry it home in your pants.)</p>
<p>Do not cough backstage. Even if a major accident occurs, do not change your calm expression. (Note: Even if the Japanese are killing you, you must remain calm and let them slaughter you. This is probably not an American idea, but a national essence.)</p>
<p>I have only copied these few precepts as "What Every Dramatist Must Read." I also hope that Mr. Xiong will continue to give us many precepts so that the future of the drama movement can be greatly promoted!</p>
<p>A Lengthy Creation</p>
<h3>Crossroads of the Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Yan Tianping</p>
<p>Yao Xing asked with a smile,</p>
<p>"Don't ask who said it, just tell me if that's what you mean."</p>
<p>"What a joke! Who has time to bother with these trivial matters! It's his fellow villager, Old Qin, who wants to drive him away."</p>
<p>"Qin Xuesong?"</p>
<p>Yao Xing nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Old Qin says he has a philosophical reason for driving away Zhu Weidao. He won't allow him to be a professor at the school."</p>
<p>"What philosophical reason?"</p>
<p>"Because Zhu Weidao is not only from Sichuan but also from Old Qin's hometown, M County. It's probably jealousy. Jealousy is a psychological effect, so it's called a philosophical reason..."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"To be honest, Zhu Weidao isn't a very good teacher either."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Haiquan felt it was inappropriate to plead for Zhu Weidao any further. At that moment, he suddenly saw Li Yixiang engaging in a long discussion about literary theory with a young man who looked like an opium addict.</p>
<p>"Old Chen is still promoting Realism, what New Realism? We'll get scolded for that! In this era, still talking about Realism!... What a joke!"</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yixiang's hands were still tucked into his sleeves. Judging from his expression, he was dissatisfied with Chen Huamin's literary theory, shaking his head repeatedly after speaking.</p>
<p>"Now, the, the, the era, we, we, we should advocate cons, cons, cons, Constructivist art, Tectonio art. Old Zhou, ri, ri, right, right?"</p>
<p>"..........................."</p>
<p>The young man who looked like an opium addict just nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, Chen Huamin also brought two young people, making a total of eleven people. As soon as Chen Huamin arrived, he immediately announced the start of the meeting.</p>
<p>It turned out that the good news Tang Yaoxing had mentioned earlier was that they had newly organized a publishing department, where everyone's works could be published independently, and they could also receive a cheap royalty of one to two yuan per thousand characters in advance.</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Huamin also reported a piece of news that horrified Haiquan: the headquarters of the S Society had decided to hold a demonstration against imperialism on × day. Everyone was encouraged to participate enthusiastically in the parade. Those who did not participate would be considered counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Haiquan immediately thought of the fierce Japanese police officers beating rickshaw pullers that night.</p>
<p>"Th, th, th, that goes without saying. Of, of, of, course, we must participate..."</p>
<p>Li Yixiang was the first to agree with Chen Huamin's proposal. Haiquan thought that if Li Yixiang, such a frail scholar, was so enthusiastic about participating in the parade, how could he, a young man, lag behind this old predecessor?</p>
<p>After the meeting, everyone ate tea and snacks casually. They could talk freely with each other. They decided to start a social science journal and a literary journal. When discussing literary theory, Chen Huamin's New Realism and Li Yixiang's Constructivist art clashed again. Haiquan secretly asked Tang Yaoxing what Constructivist art was like.</p>

<h3>Securities March Government Bond Delivery Overview</h3>
<p>Totaling approximately 20 million, with banks mainly receiving the goods</p>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for March futures. The amount for book deliveries at the Chinese Securities Exchange was 17.93 million. After deducting 10.14 million handled by brokers through direct deliveries, only 7.79 million were actually received and delivered at the exchange. Additionally, brokers settled directly outside the exchange, which is impossible to verify, but the amount was likely significant. The process went smoothly, with financial institutions mostly receiving the goods, and small, scattered investors mostly delivering. Regarding market price fluctuations, due to the League of Nations' diplomatic urgency and rumors about Jehol and Tianjin, the market price fluctuated greatly. From the initial call price on January 30 to the final market price on March 27, the difference between the highs and lows was only two or three yuan. However, the two months in between saw constant changes, with turbulent conditions and hidden dangers. Despite the market price rising and falling, due to many investors, each dip was followed by a rebound. As a result, the closing price on March 27 was still the highest, because speculators used the situation to short sell, while investors used the opportunity to buy. Ultimately, investors with their stronger financial resources prevailed. The March settlement figures are listed below (in units of 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Raw Cotton: Buyers of This Month's Futures Suffer Losses</h3>
<p>Prices have steadily declined since trading began, influenced by foreign cotton and foreign aggression.</p>
<p>The March futures price for yarn, listed on October 1st of last year, was 149.6 taels. Although a certain factory purchased and absorbed a large amount, the American cotton market was weak, domestic rural areas were bankrupt, and yarn sales were slow. The market price declined. Towards the end of the year, sales improved slightly, and the market showed some signs of recovery. However, with the worsening global trend, the cotton industry remained in a dire state. Continuing into this year, the Japanese invaded Yuguan and then Jehol, and the situation in Peiping and Tianjin became tense, causing great public anxiety and severe financial strain. Spring sales were greatly disappointing. As a result, in addition to the 130,000 bales of various national yarns, there was a rush to deliver goods, which caused market volatility. The bulls could not hold on, and the price plummeted to a low of 132.6 taels, 6 taels lower than the February price. In the end, the remaining 4,350 bales were settled at a price of 134 taels. Actual delivery totaled 900 bales, including 500 bales of 20-count Songhe yarn, 250 bales of Caihua yarn, and 150 bales of 16-count Songhe yarn. The rest were settled privately. The broker numbers and bale amounts for both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<p>The March Zheng standard for raw cotton was listed on October 11th of last year at a price of 32.4 taels. At that time, due to the increased harvest of lower-priced American cotton, the market fell to just above 31 taels. Later, due to the poor domestic cotton harvest and the decline of various sources, the gold price surged to a new high of 830 taels. This made the calculation for purchasing foreign cotton in silver very expensive, with the silver price for White Locke cotton coming to Shanghai needing 36-37 taels. This triggered some bullish activity. At the same time, a certain broker, representing a certain foreign merchant, purchased 30,000-40,000 piculs, and the market became increasingly tight. The highest price reached 34.5-6 taels. Later in the year, Indian cotton arrivals in the interior were abundant, consumption decreased, and the price of White Locke cotton fell from over 100 rupees to 176-7 rupees, equivalent to a silver price of just over 33 taels in Shanghai, down 3 taels from the end of last year. As a result, domestic cotton was difficult to support, and the market trended downwards step by step. Continuing into this month, yarn sales were very slow, and factories were extremely cautious about high-priced raw materials. After the new US President Roosevelt took office, there was still no substantial solution for maintaining cotton production. As a result, the bulls were greatly disappointed, and the lowest price was 30.075 taels, 3 qian higher than the February price. In the end, the remaining 11,700 piculs were settled at a price of 31.5 taels. Actual delivery totaled only 500 piculs, all of which was Tianjin coarse cotton. The rest were settled privately. The broker numbers and picul amounts for both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<h3>Sluggish Actual Sales of Yarn and Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>▲Cotton at a standstill</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales remained sluggish, with no activity from any group. Due to financial drought, purchasing power was severely lacking. The overseas cotton industry was also in a state of exhaustion. As a result, public morale was difficult to boost. Bidding for yarn was suspended for one day due to end-of-month settlement procedures. April 4th and 5th are Qingming Festival, and the yarn and raw cotton market will be closed for trading. A total of 92 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day, and the market situation was similar to the previous day. The amounts bought by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 25 Changsha 40 Peers 15</p>
<p>Ningbo 5 Shantou 7</p>
<p>Spot trading of raw cotton has completely stopped. Factories, due to the dire state of the yarn market, refuse to buy raw materials. Furthermore, there are signs of instability in foreign cotton, causing further decline in public morale.</p>
<h3>American Cotton: Bull Positions Closed, Price Drops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, then rose due to reactionary buying, and finally softened again due to the closing of bull positions. Futures fell by 1 to 8 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. The Indian cotton market was calm, with the closing of bull positions and broker selling. Fullgood fell by 1 rupee, Omra fell by 0.25 rupees, and White Locke fell by 1 rupee.

<h3>Grains: The Situation in the Heshia Rice Market is Settled</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources of rice coming down the river. City and suburban shops had small amounts, and while chartering continued, it was sluggish. The market situation was therefore settled. The price of rice from Suzhou and Nantong gangs, and Qingjiao rice from Nangang were only slightly higher by three to five cents. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan rice prices also stabilized.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-seven or eight sources of rice coming down the river. White粳 lacked sales in the morning, but improved slightly in the afternoon, and the market price dropped slightly. The supply and demand of Thin粳 early rice were balanced, and the market was slightly soft. There was a continuous arrival of Yang Du Jian, and retail sales were small, so the market was flat and weak. Sales of Kejian and Bu Jian rice were slow. Sales of Machine Kejian were slightly better, and prices were flat and stable. Sales of Bai Yuan were slow, and prices were stable.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Gang Purchases Over 2,000 Bags of Hunan Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for 客秈 rice suddenly became active. Because arrivals were not strong, the Fujian gang suddenly purchased a large batch of Hunan rice, and the market improved. Hunan Machine Red Rice improved by several cents, and other rice types also stabilized. The Fujian gang purchased a total of over 2,600 bags. This shop also sold over one hundred bags of machine early rice. If the Fujian gang continues to purchase actively today and tomorrow, the market may improve step by step. Throughout the day, 1,600 bags of Hunan Machine Red Rice were sold, priced at 8.40 to 8.05 yuan. In addition, 102 bags of Broken Red Rice were sold, priced at 7.65 yuan. Also, 59 bags of Broken Oil Rice were sold, priced at 8 yuan. Also, 400 bags of Broken Jing Rice were sold, priced at 6.60 to 6.20 yuan.

Jiangxi Machine Early Rice was purchased by this shop, and the rest were all purchased by the Fujian gang, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour: Active but Then Weakens</h3>
<p>| Impacted by the Low Prices of Imported Wheat |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially appeared flat and then active. However, because the price of imported wheat fluctuated by one jiao, public sentiment naturally became flat. At the beginning of this month, it opened at a slightly lower price of 2.5 li. Later, because northern groups, such as Tianjin, Shandong, and Yingkou, all made purchases, the market became tight, and the price rose by slightly more than one fen from the initial price. Long-term prices also increased because customer groups made purchases, and public sentiment also followed suit. At that time, existing stocks of Bingchuan and Lao Che flour were both quoted at 1.735 taels, and the standard for this month was therefore tight. However, when trading opened in the afternoon, the market prices for all months flattened again. The quoted price for imported wheat became cheaper, with 63-pound Argentine wheat quoted at 3.19 taels and New Zealand wheat quoted at 3.26 taels. It was said that factories had arranged to import a ship. At the same time, factories were also selling, and the market weakened again. If the price of imported wheat continues to fall, the future will inevitably be impacted. As a result, this month's price was 5 li higher than the previous day, April's was 2.5 li higher, May's was unchanged, June's was 5 li lower, July's was 2.5 li lower, and August's was unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market: Became Active Only in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, prices for all months trended towards stagnation again. There were no trades seen for April to July. Only the August opening price fluctuated slightly. By the time trading opened in the afternoon, the market had become active, and trading also became smoother. However, price fluctuations were minimal. For the near term, only dealers still had hedging positions, but some had already been placed in warehouses and were unwilling to sell at low prices. For the long term, imported wheat became cheaper and cheaper, and the standard was not much different from the current one. Therefore, public sentiment was flat. Given this situation, the future of the wheat market is not optimistic. As a result, this month's price was 1 fen higher than the previous day, August's was 1 fen lower, and the rest were unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake: A Large Volume of Transactions, Huai'an Market Temporarily Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market saw active sales. Customer cakes arrived one after another, and consignees competed to lower prices. Dealers took the opportunity to buy. It included opening 3,000 slices of Dalian Light Edge Cake at a slightly lower price, with the price remaining at the original level. Also, 1,500 slices of Pukou Yuankang Cake were priced at 1.23 taels. 3,800 slices of Wuxi Hengde, with delivery in five or six days, Sanpai Lizhi Cake were priced at 1.25 taels, and 2,400 slices of Sipai Luzhi Cake were priced one qian less than the Sanpai. This factory's cake, 3,000 slices, were purchased by dealers. The market gradually differentiated. Sales to customers in Wenzhou, Taizhou, Shantou, and the Southern Gang were slightly slow, and were all goods resold by dealers. Oil market sentiment was stable because although the supply could be continuously received, sales in various locations gradually expanded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Spot Silk Prices All Report Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, local Shanghai American silk merchant firms received telegrams from the New York silk market stating that the sluggishness of the New York silk market was worsening day by day. Yokohama raw silk prices fell again and again, and the New York silk futures market was increasingly depressed. Raw silk factories were still inactive, and prices for Chinese, Japanese, and Italian silk all declined. Japanese silk fell by 8-9 cents per pound, and Chinese white silk and Italian special-grade white silk both fell by 5-6 cents per pound. New York's silk inventory was large, sales were slow, and the silk market may not recover in the short term.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Qimen Tea Market</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea has become an important commodity in the foreign-owned tea market in recent years due to the increased tea prices. Last year, Qimen tea sales suffered greatly due to the increase in tariffs imposed by the British and the rise in exchange rates. As a result, tea warehouses and shops are somewhat silent regarding the progress of this year's Qimen tea business. Now that the Qingming Festival is approaching and tea business is about to begin, according to a letter from Qimen warehouses, 70-80% of the tea processing shops have already been deployed and are proceeding as usual. Tea warehouses such as Hong Yuanyong, Zhong Xin Chang, and Yong Xinglong have each accepted over 5,000 character numbers, and there are also 20-30 other tea warehouses accepting smaller orders. Tea warehouses have released over one million taels of tea funds in total. However, most shops are taking a cautious attitude towards the market price of crude tea, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic White Sugar Spot Prices Rise</h3>
<p>| Broker Offers Increased by 4.5 Qian |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened as gold prices fell back and foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. The Guild's opening price for ordinary grade #24 coarse sand white sugar was initially quoted at 15.05 taels, but there were few offers. Later, 50 bags were traded at 0.025 taels, which was 0.025 taels lower than the previous day. The prices of #20 and #18 medium sand white sugar and #8 and #9 Dutch red sugar were all quoted at the original prices, but no transactions were heard. The market for domestic green, red, and white sugar remained strong. For example, the price of high-quality Bing white sugar, according to telegrams from the producing area, has been gradually increasing, with an increase of about half a tael. Therefore, the broker offered 15.8 taels yesterday. The price of green and red sugar was all quoted higher, but the intentions of the shops have not yet aligned, resulting in few transactions.</p>

<h3>Japan-Siam Amity: Japanese Railway Minister Invites Siamese Railway Minister to Visit Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Siam, which abstained from voting on the resolution during the League of Nations Assembly, showing partiality to Japan, is gradually developing friendly relations with Japan. Japanese Railway Minister Mitsuji Chūji, with the aim of increasing the closeness between Japan and Siam, has invited the Siamese Railway Minister to visit Japan. This plan was conceived as early as the 31st. However, progress has been quite rapid since Siam's abstention at the Assembly. As a result of negotiations entrusted by the Railway Ministry to the Foreign Ministry, the consent of the Siamese authorities has been obtained. The Japanese Railway Ministry has decided to treat him as a guest of the Railway Ministry, inviting him to inspect the actual conditions of Japanese railways and commerce and industry, and at the same time to express gratitude for his actions in Geneva. It is reported that the Siamese Railway Minister will visit Japan in mid-April when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Gazette Publishes: World Conflict Becoming Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Inevitably Destroys the Washington Treaty</p>
<p>The Four-Power Pact Plan Leads to the Revision of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" today, under the title "Revising Treaties or Preparing for a New War," discussed the international situation following Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It stated that the extreme exacerbation of world conflict has appeared in a clear form on the international political stage. This exacerbation is primarily due to the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, which has become one of the items on the international agenda, and the revision of the Washington Treaty will follow closely. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations indicates that it has notified the countries that co-signed the Washington Treaty that it will no longer consider this treaty. American public opinion's criticism of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations shows how heated the atmosphere in the Far East has become. However, in this situation, what we can undoubtedly know is that the capitalist world, fearing new wars in Europe and the Far East, will inevitably attempt to shift the blame to the Soviet Union. Regarding this point, we should point out that a certain alliance has recently formed between Germany and England. Japan's claim to protect capitalist culture to conceal its imperialist aggression is also a well-known fact. The Soviet people must pay close attention to the development of this League of Nations situation. The Soviet government does not want to interfere in the wars between imperialists but is confident that it can repel all attempts to break the Soviet Union's territorial integrity and independence. The Soviet Union believes that this policy will certainly be supported by the working people of the world. Finally, the newspaper stated that the Soviet Union represents a world power and is also paying close attention to the trend of the world conflict situation, and is also very concerned about the recent proposal of the so-called Four-Power Conference, to manipulate the fate of various countries.

<h3>Nanyang Islands Restrict Import of Chinese Firecrackers</h3>
<p>Singapore The Straits Settlements government proposed during a Legislative Council meeting to restrict the import and use of Chinese firecrackers. The Chinese in Malaya do not oppose this proposal, but they hope the government will not implement it too hastily, as the custom of setting off firecrackers is related to religion. The authorities do not intend to prohibit the Chinese from setting off firecrackers during the Lunar New Year festival, but they hope they will exercise some restraint. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warlords Seize the Opportunity to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway: Is This the Fuse for a Russo-Japanese Conflict?</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic sources, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is taking a provocative strategy toward Russia regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. There are two reasons for this: 1. For several years, the Japanese have secretly planned to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, but the time was not right to realize it. However, Vice-Minister Ohashi, a puppet, still strongly advocated it, so this time they seized the opportunity to create trouble. 2. As a foreign policy restraint, the Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that since Hitler came to power, he has been actively pursuing an anti-Russian policy, and British-Russian relations have deteriorated due to the arrest of British technicians. Therefore, Japan is taking the opportunity to make things difficult for Russia to achieve its long-cherished goals. (Lianhua News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 29th, the "Manchukuo" authorities prevented Soviet actions regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Consul-General in Harbin protested to Diplomatic Commissioner Shi Liben, stating that the transport of soybeans by land from Northwest Siberia had been verbally permitted by the Northeast government three years ago, and "Manchukuo" had no right to prevent it. "Manchukuo" decided to respond that while the transport of goods was not impermissible, the method was incorrect. (Den Tsushin, 31st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the Soviet Union has advocated international transportation, moving all 4,500 locomotives and freight cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway back to its country. Despite repeated negotiations by "Manchukuo," they refused to return them. More recently, they have planned to move all the locomotives and freight cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway. On the 29th, "Manchukuo" prevented the movement of Chinese Eastern Railway trains from the eastern and western borders of Manzhouli and Poltawka-Zabaykalsk to Russia. Russian-American relations have gradually become tense, centering on this transportation issue, which deserves serious attention. (Den Tsushin, 31st)</p>

<h3>Center of European Politics Shifts to Paris: Representatives of the Little Entente Plan to Have the French Government Devise a Counter-Proposal to the Four-Power Pact Plan</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 30th The center of European politics has shifted from Geneva to Paris today. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu has arrived here. He is a key figure in the formation of the Little Entente's administrative council and is recognized as the spokesperson for small countries. Tonight, Titulescu will meet with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Foncault to discuss the Roman Plan for the reconstruction of Europe. Titulescu is deeply concerned that the proposed European supervisory system will exert psychological pressure on small countries. Therefore, his aim is to propose a response to this pressure. Titulescu also wants to ascertain the French government's attitude during his visit to Paris, as the French government, while declaring its determination to abide by the League of Nations Covenant, is unwilling to be bound by its details. The French government has not publicly announced anything on this point, leading to demands in some quarters of France for a change of foreign minister and a reorganization of the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Future of Disarmament</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 30th The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, arrived in London today from Geneva for rest. He expressed his opinion to guests that as a result of the British plan, the Disarmament Conference will deal with the reality of the situation rather than focusing on empty talk. When the meeting resumes in the future, the British plan will be studied item by item. At that time, there will naturally be important practical decisions. He hopes that this procedure will only take a few weeks. If a disarmament convention is not prepared for signature by the time the League of Nations Assembly resumes in September, he will be greatly disappointed.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Dispute</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 30th Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons today that the British government is extremely concerned about the arrest of British engineers from Wickers Electrical Company in Russia. Therefore, he telegraphed the British Ambassador to Moscow, Warren, yesterday, ordering him to return home immediately to discuss everything. During his return to England, the Chargé d'affaires of the British Embassy in Moscow, Mr. Strachan, will serve as Acting Ambassador.</p>
<p>▲TASS, Moscow, 30th According to a statement released here today, the initial hearing of the British and Russian engineers from the Wickers factory who were detained for sabotaging Soviet electrical undertakings has been completed. A public trial will be held here in the Supreme Court on April 9th or 10th. The defendants, including MacDonald, Gregory, Vivitsky, Volkovsky, Gosev, and Zorin, will be charged with violating Articles 58, Sections 6-11 of the Russian Criminal Code. The special court hearing the case will be composed of Mr. Ulrich, Professor Martens of the Diesel Academy, and Mr. Temitriev, Director of the Torque Construction Trust, all from the Supreme Court. Mr. Ulrich will preside. In addition, Mr. Shlykov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Electrical Industry and Power Station Engineers Trade Union, will serve as alternate judge. Vyshinsky and Rochinsky will serve as chief and deputy prosecutors.</p>
<h3>Davis to Go to Paris</h3>
<p>▲Havas, London, 30th The American disarmament representative, Norman Davis, arrived here last night. Today, he discussed the entire World Economic Conference and disarmament issues with the [illegible] government. He will study the details further tomorrow and will go to Paris on Monday. He will meet with French Prime Minister Daladier on Tuesday. Regarding the World Economic Conference, the United States intends that preparations should be made first in Washington by British and American representatives or representatives of other countries. The Preparatory Committee of the World Economic Conference in Geneva is scheduled to convene on April 26th and will meet for five or six weeks. The World Economic Conference will then be convened between the end of May and June 5th. After arriving in France, Norman Davis will discuss mainly disarmament conference issues with French Prime Minister Daladier, while the World Economic Conference is also on the agenda. In addition, Norman Davis also has the task of contacting the Soviet representative in Geneva, which is probably related to the issue of American recognition of the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Aviation Industry in the Last Decade</h3>
<p>Currently, the Soviet Union's air transportation network is extremely widespread. The total length of national air routes exceeds 45,000 kilometers. Three large aviation administrations crisscross the country, extending from the western border directly to the Pacific Ocean, from Leningrad directly to Afghanistan, north to the Arctic Ocean, and south to the borders of Turkey and Persia. The most remote and backward regions of the federation, such as Yakutia and Sakhalin, now have regular air traffic, connecting them with the nation's cultural centers. In the arid desert regions of Kazakhstan and Central Asia, where camels have been the sole means of transportation for centuries, the sound of airplanes now resonates, and thousands of travelers can cover journeys that once took months in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Pioneers of new air routes tirelessly brave the extreme cold air pressure of the Arctic Ocean, traversing the entire Arctic coastline. Simultaneously, another courageous expedition sets out from the mouth of the Lena River, travels along the Arctic coast directly to the Yenisei River, and reaches the Taimyr Peninsula and Yamal Peninsula. A third team departs from Arkhangelsk, advancing around the Ural Mountains to meet the second team.</p>
<p>In 1923, air transport carried 229 passengers, 1.8 tons of mail, and 100 kilograms of cargo. In 1932, the total numbers were 27,225 passengers, 429.7 tons of mail, and 447 tons of cargo. This is the path of development for Soviet air transport over the past decade. In air transportation, the Soviet Union is now on par with the largest countries in Europe.</p>
<p>However, the work of the Soviet civil aviation fleet is not limited to developing air transport. One of the Soviet Union's greatest achievements—the success of regular shipping between the coastal areas of the Soviet Union's European and Asian regions—is entirely due to the help of airplanes. In the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, airplanes have been used to help detect and hunt seals. Around 1921 and 1923, many countries began experimenting with using airplanes to aid agriculture and forestry. However, in capitalist countries, this "aviation chemistry" method of eliminating agricultural and forestry pests encountered insurmountable difficulties. Land was divided among many individual owners, making the use of airplanes uneconomical.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has possibilities that other countries do not. It can apply airplanes in agriculture. In 1925, the Soviet Union first used airplanes to spread pesticide powder over 1,000 hectares of land. Seven years later, in 1932, the area where pesticide powder was spread by airplanes was about one million hectares, of which 430,000 hectares were for eliminating field mice and other pests, and 580,000 hectares were for eliminating cholera-carrying insects. These figures alone are sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of state ownership of land in improving agriculture. Regarding the application of airplanes in agriculture, the Soviet Union far surpasses all other countries (including the United States).</p>
<p>In addition, aerial photography also plays a significant role in the national economy. Aerial photography provides convenience for rural geography and replaces other methods of rural geography. The significance of aerial overviews is very important in studying the vast area of the Soviet Union, in measuring areas, and in discovering new water power and new mineral deposits. Attempts to produce aerial overviews began in 1925, covering an area of 900 square kilometers. By last year, this figure had increased more than a hundredfold, to 108,000 square kilometers.</p>
<p>All of this is the regular, ordinary, daily work of the civil aviation fleet. In addition to these daily tasks, the civil aviation fleet has special tasks almost every year. One of the most famous tasks it has completed in the past was the rescue of the Italian airplane "Italia" by the Soviet airplanes "Zhihrovski" and "Babushkin". In the spring of 1932, dozens of fishermen stood on ice floes, drifting out of the Penzhina Sea, unable to return. It was the airplane "Garuhof" that first discovered these fishermen and guided rescue ships to save them. The airplane "Sripnev" boldly flew to search for the bodies of the American aviator Eielson and his pilot, who died in the Arctic Ocean. It found their bodies and transported them to Alaska. Lastly, it should be pointed out that airplanes deliver newspaper lead type to cities across the country. The history of aviation is very closely related to the history of the aviation industry. The Soviet civil aviation fleet, in its early days, was used as the basis for developing the domestic aviation industry. In fact, the Soviet Union's earliest airline used foreign airplanes and foreign engines, and these are still in use in some places.</p>
<p>It was not until recently that they began to build their own airplanes entirely from Soviet raw materials, according to the designs of Soviet engineers. The airplanes built by Ukrainian engineer Kalinin and the airplanes of the famous architect Tupolev are among the most outstanding. Since the latter half of 1931, these airplanes have begun to displace foreign airplanes in Soviet air transport. 1932 was the year that Soviet airplanes, especially the aforementioned airplanes, took the leading position on Soviet air routes.</p>
<p>The Soviet government has established a large aviation research institute, which has produced dozens of new, more complete, and more modern airplane models. A 30-seat passenger plane has already been built, demonstrating the superiority of Soviet airplane design. In this respect, the Soviet Union has again joined the ranks of first-class countries.</p>
<p>Young university students at the Kharkiv Aviation Institute have manufactured a passenger plane with a walkway and many technical improvements. In its first test flight, this plane flew at a speed of 290 kilometers per hour. University students at the Leningrad Civil Aviation Institute used "beechwood" to build a specially structured airplane, which significantly reduced the weight of the airplane. On its first flight, this plane only needed three and a half hours to fly from Leningrad to Moscow. Airplane architects Yakovlev and Shavrov, who have just graduated from school, have built several small airplane models and an airplane that can dock on water and land. At the Civil Aviation Institute, a bold attempt was made to build an airplane that completely differs from the ordinary principles used in the airplane industries of other countries. They used stainless steel to replace aluminum and used electrical welding methods to replace rivets. A completely new type of airplane, "Steel-2," was created according to this method. This is a revolution in airplane technology.</p>
<p>Until 1913, the transport airplanes of the Soviet civil aviation fleet only knew of foreign engines. Therefore, the Soviet Union had to engage in establishing its own airplane engine industry. The manufacture of transport airplane engines took place at the end of 1931, when two types, Mr5 and M26, were created. It is easy to understand that this initial output of Soviet industry was insufficient to meet the needs for airplane engines. These airplanes were not sufficient to meet modern needs, whether in terms of speed, durability, or manufacturing quality. Therefore, the airplane industry is greatly engaged in manufacturing better quality and more durable engines. This year, the engines have undergone major renovations. The transport airplane ANT9 does not use three air-cooled engines, but two water-cooled engines. These engines are also produced in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the speed of the airplane is accelerated, and greater safety is achieved. The Mr5 engines on the K5 airplane have also been replaced by other Soviet engines.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Soviet airplane engine industry is a very great achievement. If the main difficulty in manufacturing airplanes is the lack of architects and technical talent, then the difficulty in manufacturing engines is more than that. The low level of the Soviet steel industry greatly hinders the manufacture of engines. Only by improving the steel industry and improving the technology of smelting and refining steel can the necessary raw materials and technical foundations be provided for engine manufacturing. Today, it has been fully realized to manufacture new-style airplane engines with rationalized methods in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The aviation economy is not just about manufacturing airplanes and manufacturing airplane engines. New-style airports urgently need special parking and take-off equipment. In 1932, the United States had a total of 2,094 airports and landing strips, with equipment costs estimated at 800 million gold dollars. Soviet airports are far behind the United States and also behind most European countries.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union has spent considerable money on the civil aviation economy in recent years. In 1929, the national budget only stipulated a civil aviation expenditure of 5 million rubles. In 1930, the actual expenditure on civil aviation reached 30 million rubles. In 1931, it increased to 130 million rubles, and in 1932, it increased to 150 million rubles. This year, it should be 170 million rubles. These many expenditures will enable the civil aviation fleet to be thoroughly transformed, creating a foundation for the Soviet Union to catch up with the most advanced countries in the world in aviation. (Translated from the Moscow Weekly, No. 7, February 12, 1933).</p>
<h3>American Banking Panic (First Letter)</h3>
<p>(February 28th)</p>
<p>Eager prophets are shouting every day, "The panic tide has subsided, prosperity has begun, and a new era of capitalism is about to arrive!" However, the facts are contrary to this. The destruction of a new panic is about to become uncontrollable, and world capitalism will further decline from now on.</p>
<p>In mid-February, the Union Guardian Trust Company of Michigan, a private bank of the Ford Trust, experienced a major crisis, dragging six hundred banks in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania into the whirlpool of panic at the same time. The capital of these six hundred banks totaled no less than 1.5 billion gold dollars. All banks and savings banks in the aforementioned states had to close for a week, and all economic activity completely ceased.</p>
<p>Now the banks in Michigan are still closed. Minnesota and New Jersey are following the same path as Michigan. The American banking system is fundamentally shaken, so transactions are "weakened," market prices have plummeted, greatly restricting the trading of securities, and further preparing to trigger a new crisis. The new intensification of the economic panic is already obvious.</p>
<p>A few large banks on Wall Street with sufficient financial resources, such as Morgan Chase National Guaranty Trust, etc., are using the new intensification of the panic to expand their sphere of influence. Within a few hours after the crisis at the Union Guardian Trust Company in Detroit (Michigan), the large banks on Wall Street announced "assistance," which means that if the Detroit bank is willing to abandon its independence and join them, they will lend money to the bank. If the large banks on Wall Street can get the Union Guardian Trust Company to join, it will be a major advance in seizing the automotive industry, which mainly cooperates with its own Detroit banks. If this cooperation is not enough, it will cooperate with Chicago bank capital.</p>
<p>Until now, the Detroit bank has been trying to resist, but it has long been unable to resist. The large banks in New York first want to "conquer" this Detroit bank, and then Chicago and other relatively independent banking centers.</p>
<p>According to the report of P. Frey on the Senate investigation committee, it is easy to see the greatness of New York's banking power. Frey compiled statistics on the supervisory committees under the managers of many New York banks to show the power of Wall Street's banking capital and its degree of integration with American industry.</p>
<p>According to Frey's research, the sixteen largest private banks in New York have a total of seventy-one supervisory committee branches in important public banks in New York. In addition, there are a total of nine hundred and ninety-six supervisory committee special commissioners in the nation's largest industrial factories.</p>
<p>The eight largest public banks in New York have a total of three thousand seven hundred and forty-one supervisory committee special commissioners, distributed as follows:</p>
<p>Insurance companies 287</p>
<p>Other banks 301</p>
<p>Gas, water, and power plants 521</p>
<p>Railway, shipping, aviation transportation, and other companies 585</p>
<p>Industrial enterprises 846</p>
<p>Other companies 1201</p>
<p>The largest of these eight public banks is Chase National Bank. With the help of these supervisory committee special commissioners, this bank alone controls eight hundred and twenty-eight companies.</p>
<p>In addition, these large banks are very closely colluded with each other (under intense mutual competition).</p>
<p>These large banks continue to absorb new banks, making the new banks rely on themselves in some form and investing capital in the new banks. Thus, the power of the large banks becomes even greater, but the organization of the large banks becomes more ununified and easier to shake.</p>
<p>The Detroit bank must give up its independence. The question now is whether to join the Chicago bank or directly join the New York bank. If it does not turn a corner in Chicago and immediately joins the New York bank directly, then the second banking crisis that is about to come to Michigan will not be the Detroit bank's business, but the business of the Detroit "branch" of the large banks on Wall Street.</p>
<p>As it stands, the impact of the banking crisis in Michigan has already caused a general phenomenon of withdrawing deposits from banks in the United States, because people believe that the crisis that occurred in Michigan today could happen in Pennsylvania, Virginia, or other places tomorrow. But if the Detroit bank becomes a "branch" of Wall Street, then the next banking crisis will make the New York banks unable to take care of themselves, and its impact will be completely different. Therefore, the current banking panic in the United States, on the one hand, continues to intensify the American banking system, and at the same time creates a foundation for a greater panic.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Representative Yang Dezhao Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Will wait in Shanghai to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek before entering Beijing</p>
<p>Guangdong's support for the troops in Rehe will depart as soon as they meet up with the Fujian troops</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's representative Yang Dezhao, along with his wife and Wang Jingwei's secretary Li Haoju and his wife, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Hoover this morning at 8:30 AM. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with him on the ship. Yang said that he would first meet with Vice President Song in Shanghai to inquire about the exact date of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Shanghai, wait in Shanghai to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and report everything, and then go to Beijing to meet with President Wang. The Guangdong anti-Japanese army will depart to the north as soon as they meet up with the troops of Fujian. The following is a summary of Yang's remarks:</p>
<p>Waiting for a Meeting with Chiang Kai-shek Yang said that he originally intended to take the Empress of Canada to Shanghai, but later changed to the President Hoover due to business matters. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to first visit Vice President Song to inquire about the exact date of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Shanghai, wait in Shanghai to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and report everything, and then go to Beijing to meet with President Wang.</p>
<p>Suppressing the Bandit Military Affairs The military affairs of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi have not stopped since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went north to resist Japan, and are still in active progress. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek originally intended to invite Chen Bonan to take charge, but Chen could not take full responsibility because of the heavy workload in Guangdong. Yu Hanmou is only taking on a part of the work. The title has not been determined and will be known after meeting with Chiang and Wang.</p>
<p>About to Set Out Guangdong will send ○○ regiments to take on the work of suppressing the communists. Guangdong could have set out earlier, but because of the lack of organization of the baggage train, the transportation required the recruitment of laborers. It was the spring plowing season, and it was not easy to recruit them, so they had to recruit from Hunan and Guangxi provinces. As soon as it is completed, they can be mobilized and depart within one or two days. In the future, about three-tenths of the garrison will be dispatched first, and then gradually up to eight-tenths. As for Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Army, he has also decided to send troops to support Rehe.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties The expenses for suppressing the bandits are relatively difficult. In the past, Guangdong's expenses were mostly donated by overseas Chinese, but recently, due to the failure of overseas Chinese businesses, the income has decreased by more than one million each year, and the export trade is also poor, resulting in a financial deficit. Therefore, Guangdong's military expenses are only 50%. If there is really no way to pay for the military expenses for fighting the bandits this time, they can only ask the central government for subsidies, but this is not a blackmailing behavior, but is out of necessity.</p>
<p>Supporting Rehe to Resist Japan Guangdong's dispatch of troops to support Rehe to resist Japan is about to be mobilized, and there are no regulations on any name such as the National Salvation Army. It will still use the original designation of the Independent Fourth Division. After meeting up with the troops of the 19th Route Army of Fujian, they can depart after reaching a suitable location.</p>
<p>Consistent Diplomacy The southwest's position on foreign affairs is of course consistent with the central government, that is, resisting Japan and suppressing the communists. Without resisting Japan, there is no diplomacy to speak of. Only by resisting Japan can diplomacy be handled. This section is the same as what Mr. Wang Jingwei said. As for me, I did not meet with Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, so Hu did not have a letter to bring to me. Only Chen Bonan has a letter to convey to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but this is also a common occurrence, and the content is nothing more than the above, hoping that after resisting Japan and suppressing the communists, the bandit communists can be eliminated, so that they can resist Japan and suppress the communists, which are indeed related. As for compromising diplomacy, it is certainly not something that we dare to agree with. Not only does Chen personally advocate this, but all armed comrades also have the same view.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Organized a Custodial Committee for Aviation Donations from Various Industries</h3>
<p>Designated Banks and Money Shops to Collect Donations and Urge Shanghai Businesses to Pay Donations</p>
<p>In order to vigorously implement the national aviation salvation plan, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the requests of more than 70 trade associations such as the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, has organized a custodial committee for aviation donations from various trade associations, designated banks and money shops to collect donations, and at the same time sent letters urging all executive and supervisory committee members to quickly pay the donations for airplanes raised from Shanghai businesses to the association in order to pool funds for purchasing airplanes. The various letters are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Nominated Custodial Committee Members Respected Sirs, at the 32nd Standing Committee Meeting of this association on the 3rd of this month, the organization of a custodial committee for aviation donations from various trade associations and the designation of banks and money shops to collect aviation donations, which was submitted by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, was discussed and resolved. All executive and supervisory committee members of this association and Ge Jechen, Ke Ganzhen, Lu Zhengbing, Lu Fengzhu, Liu Minzhai, Tu Kaizheng, Shao Baoxing, and other seven people were appointed as custodial committee members, and Committee Member Wang Xiaolai was nominated as the convener of the committee. The China Silk Industry Bank, the Salt Industry Bank, the Third Bank, the Hengxun and Tongchun money shops, and the Siming Savings Society were designated as collection points, etc. Apart from separate letters, this is to record the case and inform you for your information.</p>
<p>Letter Urging Shanghai Businesses to Donate Respected Sirs, at the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 28th of this month, the letter from more than 70 trade associations such as the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, submitting six proposals for national aviation salvation, was discussed. In addition to immediate modification and passage, which was submitted to the Standing Committee for handling, it was also resolved that each executive and supervisory committee member of this association should recognize and donate 5,000 yuan, and the deadline is before April 15. Please pay the money to the association. This is to record the case and inform you. Please note that you must quickly pay the 5,000 yuan for the No. 1 airplane from Shanghai businesses that was decided to raise last time before the deadline. This matter concerns the reputation of the group's patriotism. I hope you will not delay again. I sincerely hope.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants' Stock from Outlying Areas Will End Today; 39,373 Sets Have Been Recovered</h3>
<p>After the China Merchants' Bureau was taken back by the state, it was stipulated that each set of stock was worth 50 taels of silver, to be recovered by the board of directors together with the Central Bank. The deadline was set at the end of February. Later, because of the short time in outlying areas, the stock could not be sent in time. The Shanghai Board of Directors submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the deadline for the stock in outlying areas be extended to March 30. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with General Manager Liu Hongsheng this afternoon. According to him, the total amount of stock is 42,000 sets. The decision to recover the stock will end at 5:00 PM today. As of this afternoon, a total of 39,373 sets have been recovered. As for how to deal with the unrecovered ones, it will be decided after the board of directors asks for instructions from the Ministry.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces Cancellation of Certificate of National Products</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday stating: "Regarding the Certificate of National Products previously issued by the Commodity Exhibition Hall of this Chamber, it was resolved and declared invalid by the Standing Committee in May of last year, and a public notice was published in the newspaper. On the 28th of this month, during the joint meeting of executive and supervisory members, it was discussed again, fearing that there might still be cases of photocopying and using the certificates. It was resolved to republish the announcement in the newspaper that all such certificates have long been invalid. If they are used, they cannot be used as proof, etc., on file. It is hereby announced in the newspaper for the attention of all provincial and municipal organizations and businesses."</p>
<h3>Two More Communists Arrested Today</h3>
<p>At 1:15 AM this morning, the Supervisory Office of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau received a tip that Communist Party members were hiding at No. 66, Nantong Road, Nanxing Road intersection, Zhabei. After receiving the information, the Supervisory Director immediately ordered two inspectors to rush to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau and dispatch multiple armed police officers to the location. They broke down the door and arrested Communist Party members You A-san and Zhou Dexing on the spot. They were taken to the Fourth District Headquarters for temporary detention. At dawn, 6:30 AM, they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Inland Kidnappers Arrested</h3>
<p>Totaling Twelve Men and Women. The Hearing Postponed After Investigation.</p>
<p>According to reports received by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, the kidnappers who had committed multiple kidnapping and ransom cases in Kunshan, Qingpu, and other places had fled to Changzhou Benniu Village with their victims and recently sneaked into Shanghai, hiding at No. 291 Binlang Road in the Public Concession. At 4:30 AM this morning, detectives were dispatched to the Putuo Road Police Station to request assistance in the arrest. The head of the police station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the address. When they arrived at the house, it was just dawning. Men, women, old and young, were awakened from their dreams. Because the detectives from the Public Security Bureau did not initially specify the names of the suspects related to the kidnapping case, all residents of the house were arrested, totaling twelve men and women. Among them were Hao Ziming, Hao Lihong, Hao Lifeng, and Ziming's sisters Chen Hao and Wang Hao, as well as her niece Qian Chen Miqing, nephew Chen Jingfa, and seven others from Jiangbei. The rest were Chen Yushan, a 68-year-old from Anhui, Chen Shengfan, 52, Chen Zhao (Yushan's daughter-in-law), Qinqi Wuyu, and four others. In addition, there was Zhang Xianghua from Hangzhou. The detectives also found a pistol and 51 bullets under Chen Yushan's bed, which were all taken back to the police station and detained separately. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian Wenji conducted a preliminary hearing. Detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted an official letter requesting that all the men and women be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the police station, opposed this, stating that the arrest of these people had not been proven to be related to the kidnapping. If they were all taken away, it would be a great loss to the Concession Authority's protection of law-abiding citizens. He requested that all individuals remain in custody so that the police station could conduct an investigation, and if the Public Security Bureau wanted to transfer them, it should provide sufficient evidence to prove who the kidnappers were, or whether all the men and women were criminals, to avoid injustice. Judge Qian then questioned Hao Ziming and others briefly and approved that they be detained separately pending further investigation. The hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xiangyun's Case of Alleged Abduction and Abandonment Adjudicated</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangyun, a wealthy Ningbo native, met Wu Yue'e, a prostitute from Dongting Mountain at the Longyu Brothel, in 1915. Soon after, he rented a house at No. 100 Qinshou Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and lived with her. However, in recent years, Zhou suddenly abandoned Wu and treated her as a stranger, refusing to pay for her living expenses. Although Wu went to his door to negotiate, he refused to see her. He did not even reply to her letters arguing the matter. Wu then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Zhou of abduction and abandonment, among other charges. After several summonses by the Special Court, Zhou claimed that he had never met Wu and had never even seen her, so how could there be any abduction or other such facts? Wu presented Zhu, a female landlord from Qinshou Lane, as a witness, who testified that Wu and Zhou indeed lived together and moved out in 1927. After the debate concluded, the First Special Court's Criminal Tribunal, presided over by Court President Feng Shide, announced the verdict this morning. Ruling: Zhou Xiangyun's case is dismissed.</p>

<h3>Where Is Freedom?</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that, according to a dispatch from the Universal News Agency in Poet's Valley, Albert Einstein, the discoverer of the theory of relativity who has recently been traveling and lecturing throughout the United States, has, due to his opposition to the fascism exhibited by the National Socialist Party under the leadership of Adolf Hitler in Germany, recently asked Judge Davis, a friend in Shreveport, to announce that, should circumstances permit, he would like to become a citizen of the United States, one of the free countries.</p>
<p>This statement is the first reaction of the upper classes in Germany to be revealed overseas as a result of Hitler's big stick. We sympathize with Mr. Einstein's desire for freedom, but the method seems a bit wrong.</p>
<p>The so-called "freedom" is of course aimed at the majority of the people. In the United States today, people like Morgan and Ford are of course very free and can even influence the politics of a country, but the 12 million workers who have been abandoned by society are excluded. Although they also share the honor of being "free citizens" or "golden citizens" with Morgan, Ford, and others, which is worthy of admiration by people like Einstein, their freedom has been plundered, and gold will never flow into their pockets. All they have are the threats to life such as "hunger," "cold," and "poverty." In fact, they are walking the same "misfortune" as the six million unemployed workers under Hitler's big stick in Germany. This is not surprising, as there are many freedoms obtained through plunder in capitalist countries. Not only in the United States, but unfortunately, what Mr. Einstein praises is this kind of freedom, not the freedom of the masses.</p>
<p>I don't understand how Mr. Einstein, a thinker of epoch-making significance, can discover the theory of relativity to overthrow Newton, but cannot discover the contradictory facts existing in the United States today, namely, the fact that freedom is abused on the one hand, such as burning wheat and limiting cotton planting, and on the other hand, it is surrounded by hunger, cold, and poverty, to follow in the footsteps of Marx. I think the reason is probably that there is not a single worker with a disheveled head and a dirty face among Mr. Einstein's listeners. That's right, people who are struggling with hunger and cold really don't have the time to listen to the great theory of four-dimensional space, but Mr. Einstein is too short-sighted.</p>
<p>As for freedom, it is certainly not in Germany, but it is certainly not in the United States either. Let us read the confession of a Japanese, an imperialist: In the so-called "Sino-Japanese Federation Secret Agreement" recently hyped up by the Japanese puppets, it is written at the beginning: "In the world today, there are only two kinds of countries, one is capitalism, England, America, Japan, Italy, and France, and the other is communism, Soviet Russia..." The Japanese confession can be used as a reference for Mr. Einstein and all those who desire freedom. In another corner of the world, on that one-sixth of the land, freedom is still growing. If Mr. Einstein is seeking true freedom, then he will certainly not be satisfied with obtaining American citizenship, otherwise, even a little spirit of resistance is not worth mentioning!</p>

<h3>Song of Five Hundred Daredevils</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengqiao</p>
<p>On March 9th, Wan Fulin's army retreated in defeat from Kuancheng, and the bandit army occupied Xifengkou. Song Zheyuan's army rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and arrived at the Great Wall in the evening. Five hundred daredevils of Feng Zhi'an's division, with bare arms and holding knives, climbed the city wall, catching the bandits by surprise and killing them all. A thousand bandits were killed, and the five hundred men also died in the battle.</p>

<h3>A Letter from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Juan,</p>
<p>I really didn't expect it; in the beginning, I would have the courage to leave you, leave Mom's grave, and run from the winter in Jiangnan to this even colder weather, and I didn't expect it even more; you would let me go so happily, not like the old Wang family's at Xiahetou, crying and looking for death in a drawn-out way! That's terrible. If all Chinese women were like that, wouldn't it be over?</p>
<p>When I was at home, didn't I tell you? Our bad Chinese only know that there is a mom, dad, wife, children, and ancestors at home, so they want to make money, be traitors, scramble for power, and be puppets. Is that okay? They've all forgotten this huge China! But then again! We don't blame the common people; we only blame these bastards in power for making the common people so poor and the country so weak. One day, these guys won't do a good job anymore. Humph! The common people will deal with them. But now, we have to drive the Japanese back first.</p>
<p>Alas! Mentioning the Japanese reminds me of being a subjugated slave. It's really disheartening. There are three Koreans in our team. During the day, they hide in the sorghum fields, and when they have nothing to do, they start talking. He said that his grandfather, uncle, and father were all killed by the Japanese! A silk shop and 300 acres of land were all confiscated, leaving only him alone. He has ambition and doesn't want to be controlled by the Japanese. He ran to China, not to beg for food, but to find Captain Li and join our group to fight the Japanese. He also said: "Although our Korea is destroyed, we still produced An Jung-geun. What about us? Sun Yat-sen! The Three Principles of the People haven't seen any effect. Zhang Xueliang! People blew up his father and he still didn't resist! Alas! It's really uncomfortable and humiliating to lose face in front of subjugated slaves.</p>
<p>So we have to work hard!</p>
<p>Last month, at Sandaohe in Suotunlun, the artillery fire was very fierce at that time. The Japanese set up machine guns and mortars on the top of the old Gaobao. What about us? Everyone had only twenty bullets and six steamed buns in their waists. Captain Li really knew how to talk. He said: "Brothers, we just have to hold on until evening. The reinforcements from the pass have already arrived at Huangjiatai. As soon as the reinforcements arrive, we'll counterattack and, damn it, rush to the top of the old Gaobao and kill those bastards!" Before the word "fast" could be said, there was a loud bang. Wow, how fierce! I was lying on the ground. After a while, the thick smoke cleared. Everyone stood up. When they looked, three people were dead. Poor old Korean, who was always vomiting, was also lying motionless! A left hand was thrown ten yards away.</p>
<p>So we all hid in the sorghum; quietly waiting for dusk to arrive. The sun gradually hid in the drum tower of the old Gaobao, and the moon slowly rose from the top of the sorghum. The piercing wind blew and moved the shadows. In the village far away, there were two or three sparks faintly visible. Isn't this dusk? Haven't the reinforcements arrived yet? Everyone quietly guessed: Just as they were guessing, Captain Li called us to come out of the sorghum field and line up. Ah! Are the reinforcements coming? But what stood in front of us was such a tragic voice! "Just now, someone from Huangjiatai said that the reinforcements sent from the rear were intercepted at Da'ergou! All the front-line troops are retreating to Huangjiatai to gather. But brothers, didn't we say when we came that we would only advance and not retreat? Then, are we still—?" He lingered on the words "advance" and "retreat" and looked at the brothers for an answer.</p>
<p>A fierce charge began! Juan, forgive me for not telling you such a story that will make your heart tremble! I only remember that when I fixed the bayonet, I rushed past the brothers. I used this shiny knife to chop off two shoulders and stab through three throats. Now, looking back, even I doubt my courage at that time. I remember; when I was at home, one day, we two were sitting on the steps in the courtyard talking; a mouse crawled out of the earth hole. I was so scared that I cried out, and you laughed at me? How can someone so timid go to the front lines?</p>
<p>Although we sacrificed seventy people and killed more than one hundred and thirty Japanese, there were only twelve of us left. We had no choice but to retreat! Now, I am at the headquarters of the 37th Regiment in Huangjiatai. If you have a letter, you can send it through the Shanghai Volunteer Army Support Association.</p>
<p>You…………………</p>
<p>The bugle is blowing again…………Forgive me…………</p>
<p>Written by Jie in Huangjiatai on March 1st</p>

<h3>Can Love Accommodate Several People at the Same Time?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem that your publication is only limited to men having the right to ask about difficulties?</p>
<p>Sir! I am a saleswoman at a large domestic goods company. There is now a very difficult problem that surrounds my weak soul all day long, making me unable to sleep or eat; although I have racked my brains to control this difficult-to-control thing, I still can't find a suitable solution. So, I boldly ask you, with your insight, to think of a way for a hesitant and indecisive weak woman. Now I will tell you the facts roughly.</p>
<p>In our company, in addition to male colleagues, there are only six or seven female colleagues. We can often hear men gathering together to comment on us during their spare time. It's embarrassing to say, they actually crowned me with the title of "×× Queen" without any scruples. I am half ashamed! Half hate!</p>
<p>From then on, their feelings towards me became stronger day by day. Some wrote love letters to me, some took me home after closing time, and sometimes, even if it was my responsibility and within my ability, they would always volunteer to do it for me, as if I couldn't bear such hardship: Sir! At the same time, I have to tell you that they have no frivolous or hypocritical attitudes, but are completely sincere in their help.</p>
<p>Time is constantly moving forward, and they are also stepping up their pursuit of me. My parents love me very much, so nothing is a problem. But, secretly, I gradually examine each person's personality and talents in detail. Each person has their own strengths and advantages. Alas! Heavy shadows strongly emerge in my heart!</p>
<p>I want both the bear's paw and the fish. I can't abandon any of them, and I can't bear to sacrifice any of them. It's really difficult to part with them. It would be best if I could take them all! Sir! In this cold and contradictory society, can the facts allow me to accept love from many aspects? If I act according to my own prejudices, will I be criticized and cursed by social figures? Will it be an obstacle and pain for my future? Sir, I am unwilling to leave anyone. I want to accept the love of several people. I resolutely jump out of the cage of the old etiquette and remove the obstacles on the road of love. My God-given intelligence has been invisibly invaded and lost its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Sir! My heart hurts, my eyes are sore, please have mercy and think of the best and most beautiful way for a novice woman, how should I deal with the beginning of this lifelong event?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you to reply directly to guide me, because there are many inconveniences, but please don't discard it into the wastebasket, and answer me in detail in the newspaper. Sir, I am looking forward to it like a cloud in a drought.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The love that Ms. Jin mentioned in her letter is certainly not ordinary, broad love, but rather love between two sexes. According to the results of discussions by general scholars, love between two sexes is considered to be whole and not partial (Infractionable). In general, or perhaps one could say that anyone, can't help but have a monopolistic ambition for their lover. It is not worth our overthinking about a woman accepting the love of many people at the same time being criticized and cursed by social figures; but the fact that it will, and definitely will, cause obstacles and pain cannot be ignored! When men and women are pursuing each other, it certainly doesn't seem to be a problem; but as soon as it comes to taking things a step further, the problem immediately arises. According to reports from criminal psychologists, although "the desire to possess money" is also a strong motive for crime, "the desire to possess love" is comparatively more widespread.</p>
<p>Ms. Jin thinks that her many male colleagues each have their own strengths and advantages: This is probably because "her intelligence has been invisibly invaded and lost its effectiveness." We know that there are absolutely no two things in the world that are completely equal and indistinguishable in terms of superiority. Even if each person's strengths and advantages differ in terms of pathways, for example, some are good at eloquence, and some are good at scholarship, it can make a "hesitant and indecisive" woman feel like she is "lost in the five-mile fog" and unable to distinguish between superior and inferior. But you must know that the standard for choosing a son-in-law—especially for a woman like Ms. Jin who already has a job and can support herself—is not in the other person's scholarship or ability, but in the other person's personality and morality, and even more so in the other person's feelings. You might as well discard other aspects and focus on this one aspect to observe: If you still can't distinguish them on the surface, then you need to use some tricks to test them; if you can't see it at once, then you might as well endure your temper and watch them slowly. In Chinese stories, there is a section about "The Oil Seller Monopolizes the Courtesan" (please forgive me for the inappropriateness), I think you have also seen it. Only this kind of person with sincere feelings is a lifelong companion.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Ms. Jin is really entangled by them and loses the authority to judge, we advise you to become completely indifferent to their hearts. You must know that "it is impossible for a woman to fall in love with many men at the same time"! Perhaps your heart will cool down and your intelligence will recover. Then, choose one among them. To catch something, you must first release it; this may not be a clever strategy!</p>

<h3>Fleeting Time in a Dream (Continued XVII)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good!" Wu Yi expressed general satisfaction with the experiences of these two worthy brothers, without offering any criticism. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>"How did you get married?" After chatting for a while, Wu Yi suddenly posed this question. "I married for the sake of marrying! My goal was to have a son! Haha! Now I've achieved it!" Wang Yulin said very straightforwardly and frankly: "Most people marry for love, but I was already a heartbroken man; so last year I embraced the principle of marrying for the sake of marrying, handing over the full authority of choosing a spouse to my father, and as a result, under the watchful eyes of hundreds of congratulatory guests, I married a wife. But . . . . . . "</p>
<p>"But, the results are not bad!" Wu Yi, with a humorous tone, took over his sentence.</p>
<p>"Really, the results are very good! She is a good girl possessing all four virtues." Yulin confessed everything: "Therefore, I now have a new understanding: those who marry for love may not necessarily find happiness after marriage, while those who marry for the sake of marrying often unexpectedly gain happiness; the reason is very clear, because the former's expectations are too high, and easily lead to disappointment, while the latter originally has no extravagant expectations, and is content and happy as long as there are one or two satisfying aspects! Lao Wu! Absence makes the heart grow fonder, don't laugh at me for not making progress!"</p>
<p>The relationship that once occurred between Wu Yi and Mai E had almost consumed half of his courage. Although Mai E is now dead, he feels even more melancholy and unbearable. Especially during his three years in the United States, on average, every week he could read dozens of divorce news stories in the newspapers, which made him feel particularly disheartened: towards love, pursuit, . . . . . . these tasks that every unmarried person regards as daily routines, he also felt deeply bored. Therefore, Wang Yulin's views immediately gained his sympathy.</p>
<p>"Your insights are very correct, but, judging from my personal circumstances, it won't work! First of all, I don't have a father," speaking of his father, Wu Yi couldn't help but think of his grandfather and his mother, and felt even more that he also had the need to marry for the sake of marrying. "It's not an easy task to find someone to choose a spouse for me!" "Not difficult! Not difficult! Leave this task to me, and I guarantee you won't go wrong!" Wang Yulin secretly thought that Wu Yi was already twenty-nine years old this year and definitely had the need to marry for the sake of marrying, so he quickly volunteered. "As long as you guarantee that you haven't been engaged to anyone in the United States, I can immediately assign this matter to my wife and have her introduce you to a classmate. She is a student at a girls' middle school and has many very beautiful classmates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !"</p>
<p>Wu Yi smiled humorously, without indicating whether he agreed or disagreed; in the following days, he was busy contacting the editor-in-chief of the Star Newspaper about the issue of renewing his contract, and he didn't have time for this for a while, so he gradually forgot about it. Unexpectedly, Wang Yulin was truly a most enthusiastic friend. In less than two months, following a series of half-new, half-old marriage procedures involving exchanging photos and sending horoscopes, he helped Miss Liu Suzhen, one of his wife's esteemed classmates, become Dr. Wu Yi's wife, like a coupon.</p>
<p>"I never thought that a returned student like you, so filled with new ideas, could solve your marriage so accommodatingly!" A colleague who knew his background well, on the day of the wedding feast, looked at him with the eyes of an ordinary PhD or Master's degree holder, expressing surprise: believing that it was a very abnormal act for a returned student not to pursue love, for a returned student not to pursue a female returned student.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry! I have my own principles:" Wu Yi replied calmly: "I don't want to marry for love, I don't want to marry to create news for the newspapers, so I'm too lazy to talk about love with the general modern girls first, and then marry them; I certainly don't want to marry for the sake of studying, so of course there's no need to marry a returned student as a wife. To put it bluntly, I'm marrying for the sake of marrying!"</p>

<h3>Reshooting of Films</h3>
<p>— Xingzhi</p>
<p>In recent times, the film industry in Hollywood has been trending toward the most intense competition. The British ban on movie stars leaving the country, the German use of science to actively rectify, and the French and Russian government encouragement of the film industry are all enough to make Hollywood tremble. In the past two months, production has been very cautious. Whenever a new film comes out, if one or two flaws are discovered during the screening, the unsatisfactory section is immediately reshot. It is not uncommon for reshoots to result in additional losses of more than ten thousand dollars, which shows the greatness of the spirit of sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the past, there were sometimes opportunities for reshoots, but the most unforgettable one was during the screening of "All Quiet on the Western Front." The tragic character in the film was the bitter-faced woman San Sobiets. Unexpectedly, when this San Sobiets appeared on the screen, everyone who attended the screening burst out laughing, so a large section of this film was cut and reshot, and San Sobiets's tragic character was replaced by someone else.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy, in her recent work "Rebound," spent eight weeks in seclusion, four weeks practicing, and four weeks filming, and even became ill from the hard work. However, after the screening, several places were found that needed to be reshot, and Myrna had no choice but to work while ill.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's "As You Desire Me" was screened, and Greta's scene of dancing as a waitress in a café, and the scene of the couple reuniting later, were both reshot. These two scenes are the highlights of the whole film, so of course they are important.</p>
<p>RKO's new film "Rockabye" stars Constance Bennett and Joel McCrea. Joel McCrea had only filmed a few scenes when he had to leave Hollywood due to a family matter. RKO then hired Phillips Holmes to replace Joel McCrea, but the results were very unsatisfactory, so they waited for McCrea to return and reshot the scenes, which lived up to the film's title, "Sacrificing" more than ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Gloria Swanson's new film "Perfect Understanding" was completed, but it was discovered that a scene needed to be reshot, and the male lead had already left for Europe, so they had to send a telegram asking him to return.</p>
<p>Sidney Franklin's new film "One Hour With You" needed to be reshot after the screening, but Sidney Franklin could not get away in New York, so the director, the filming crew, and the other actors all ran to New York to reshoot.</p>
<p>Constance Talmadge's new film "Her Night of Romance" was reshot three times, and Ann Harding's "Westward Passage" was also reshot twice. Both films were produced by RKO. Comparatively speaking, RKO has more reshot films and a greater spirit of sacrifice. It is not easy for RKO to have risen to the second-highest position in Hollywood, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Flesh"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>This film tells the story of a sincere and straightforward man who falls in love with a girl and marries her, but because he is not good at tenderness and his wife has another lover, there are often disagreements between the couple. Later, they finally reconcile.</p>
<p>This film is characterized by its skillful portrayal, so the story must be full of twists and turns. Precisely because the brilliance of the whole play lies in the outstanding performance, the entire structure can allow Wallace Beery to give full play to his talents.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Wallace Beery's acting skills are indeed very successful. He has his own unique style on the screen, known for his detailed portrayal. In this film, we can clearly see how attentive he is to the changes in emotions. It can be said that in any scene, he pays attention to his own responsibility. If we have seen James Cagney's performance in "The Public Enemy," then we will realize that these two films are indeed equally matched.</p>
<p>Regarding the director of this film, he certainly helps the protagonist a lot, and his use of the whole play is so meticulous. There is no doubt that a good film director has a great responsibility. If Wallace Beery had not met a good director in this film, then he would never have been so successful.</p>
<p>As for the female lead, and Vicardo Cortey, who plays the female lead's lover, they both perform quite well. Except for some places that are a bit over the top, most of it is very appropriate.</p>
<p>The lighting, scenery, and sound recording are all excellent.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the acting is delicate and the director is also excellent.</p>
<h3>Review of "Wax Follies" | Carlton and "Health Farm"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>This time on stage, it is still the same group of people as last time, but for the sake of the film, the singing and dancing are shorter than before. Among them, the best is still the "tap dance" by the two black men, which is roughly the same as last time.</p>
<p>In addition to the stage play, there are two films, "Health Farm," which is a two-reel comedy film that is technically not bad, but there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>The second film, "Wax Follies" (The Indiscretions of Eve), is a hilarious comedy, a hundred times better than the previous "The Champion."</p>
<p>The plot may not be worth mentioning? It simply tells the story of a duke who loves a girl, who is a model for a "wax sculpture" company, and is already engaged to the manager of that company. The duke is in unrequited love, so he buys some wax figures that look like this girl and puts on a great love drama. He eventually achieves his goal. The two go to Europe together to live a happy life.</p>
<p>In this play, the excellent results are created by the joint efforts of eight actors. Every word and action of each person has wonderful jokes, and it can be praised as "colorful everywhere." Each one is excellent, especially the extremely humorous words and deeds, and the graceful singing and dancing. The supporting roles occupy important parts of the interlude, and the chorus is very exciting. On the surface, this film gives you "laughter" and "beauty."</p>
<p>This is very rare in comedies. It is not overly nonsensical and noisy, but it can make you laugh uncontrollably.</p>
<p>This film sings and dances whenever there is an opportunity. There is very little dialogue, and it is very simple.</p>
<p>The director is of course the biggest contributor to the whole film. His flexibility and skill are admirable, because although song and dance films are easy to shoot, it is more difficult to be refined and outstanding than any other type of film. There are novel discoveries in the use of lenses and angles. The lighting and editing, there is no place that is not extremely new, and the scenery is also a powerful accompaniment. The pronunciation is also very accurate. The soundtrack is not only pleasant, but also has a humorous meaning.</p>
<p>These two films | "Health Farm" and "Wax Follies" | although we can't find anything in terms of consciousness, we can see many concepts and ideas of the British. At least they are enough to show the progress of European films and can compete with the United States for "a day's lead."</p>
<h3>Star Company Performs to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>— Binghua</p>
<p>▲ Strive for the Aviation Patriotic Movement</p>
<p>▲ All the Female Stars Perform the Great Race</p>
<p>In the current period of deepening national crisis, everyone is shouting the slogan "Aviation to Save the Nation" and working together to raise funds for aircraft. Patriotic men and women are joining one after another. In the film industry, using their own ability to appeal | performing dramas to serve public undertakings and raise funds has always been very enthusiastic. Now the Star Company is taking the lead and has scheduled to perform two shows on April 1st at the Central Grand Theater, day and night. All proceeds from the sale of tickets will be used for donations. The scheduled plays are very exciting. Finally, in the play "Da Xi Royal Manor," all the female stars and all the directors will participate in the performance of the great race. It is even more commendable that talents are gathered in one place. It is expected that the results of this event will be very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Love Contract" (The Love Contract)</h3>
<p>— Wanshi</p>
<p>This is really a hilarious comedy, especially the structure of the story is too hilarious.</p>
<p>It is very obvious that film artists who grow up in the atmosphere of capitalism, it can be said that they have never had such a thought about the pursuit of correct consciousness. The production of a comedy script only seeks to make the audience laugh on the screen, aimlessly laugh, and laugh again after laughing, so the performance of this play is praised by the general audience.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, this film is a good example.</p>
<p>However, regarding the acting skills, it can be said that they are not bad. In particular, the director's skills are indeed very flexible. He harmonizes the tone of the whole plot very brightly, so that we unconsciously accept the play's liveliness and harmony. Of course, this is the most difficult thing to do. As for the director's use of the lens, the editing is also very technical and excellent.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, we can even get an extremely unimportant supporting role that can suit the plot. The performances of the male and female leads are very lively. Especially the female lead, Winifred Shotter, is indeed exquisite and petite.</p>
<p>The lighting and scenery are not inferior. The sound recording is very clear.</p>
<p>Overall, the performance of this play is quite successful. But in terms of meaning, it is intentionally distorted.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>From "Morning in the Metropolis" to "City Nights"</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>"City Nights" and "Morning in the Metropolis" are both produced by Lianhua, both are revolutionary, and both have great appeal.</p>
<p>The theme of "Morning in the Metropolis," at first glance, is more exciting than "City Nights" because who wouldn't want to embark on the road to light in a tormented life? However, after watching "Morning in the Metropolis," I felt disappointed because its plot is completely different from the theme! Apart from the first act and the final act, which use photographic techniques to depict the morning, what kind of bright path can be explored in the story of the film? The plot of "City Nights" is described so profoundly, sharply, and tensely! In "Morning in the Metropolis," although it also contrasts the rich and the poor, the plot is much worse. Moreover, "City Nights" is struggling forward from the darkness towards the road to light. "Morning in the Metropolis" is discovering some dark things in the light and then wants to embark on the road to light from the darkness. This is the director's consciousness, but he finally did not have such majestic power to use, so apart from creating a few scenes of pushing the cart towards the sun, there is no other central idea that can imply this point!</p>
<p>Also, many places in "Morning in the Metropolis" completely imitate "City Nights." People who haven't seen "City Nights" don't feel it, but anyone who has seen "City Nights" can't help but feel bored.</p>
<h3>Review of "Flowers of Enchantment"</h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>The central point of this "Flowers of Enchantment" is the combination of comedy and song and dance. The whole film is filled with glamour, song and dance, and comedy; but the comedy is not random comedy, but comedy containing humor and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Because of the subject matter, the director has developed the song and dance and comedy as much as possible, successfully creating a lively film. The skill is very flexible and lively, and the people in the play are directed in an orderly manner, without any confusion, but many places that could be depicted are lightly let go, which is a pity. The flexibility of dividing scenes and lens angles can be used as a reference for domestic films.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Eddie Cantor is the best. He is experienced, and his performance is natural and profound, but it is a pity that there are several scenes that are over the top. Roberti is very good at expressing the personality of the people in the play and promoting the development of the plot. The other actors are average. The background is also very resplendent, and some scenes are full of poetry.</p>
<h3>Ramon Novarro Doesn't Want to Get Married</h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>A year ago, Ramon Novarro and his family lived happily together. Now, however, he has left his happy family and lives alone in a country cottage.</p>
<p>His departure from his family was not due to any disagreement with his family. He is loyal to his family from beginning to end. He does not want to pursue the opposite sex, nor does he want to get married.</p>
<p>He said to reporters in a very sad tone: "If I meet a single orphan girl, then I will marry her. Otherwise, I will never marry."</p>
<p>"My family is jointly responsible by eleven people. However, I am the only one who is the most responsible. Those eleven people are: my father, mother, five brothers, and four sisters. This is the biggest reason why I don't want to get married. My two younger brothers are about to complete their education, one just graduated from college, and the other will graduate this June. These two younger brothers are 'my children.' I am very satisfied. Why should I get married?</p>
<p>My youngest brother likes to become an architectural expert, and I am convinced of his talent. I plan to take him to Spain. When I finish shooting my second film, I will take him to Europe to see the magnificent architecture.</p>
<p>I am confident that I will never marry. If God makes me marry and have children, I am afraid that God will never give me 'ready-made children' like my younger brothers. I like music and books, which is also one of the reasons why I don't want to get married."</p>
<h3>Spring Fashion of Hollywood Actresses in 1933</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Before the start of 1933, the general actresses in Hollywood were making a lot of noise about new clothes. Hollywood then arose in response and produced a famous clothing maker. He used his extraordinary skills and ideas to invent many new clothes. The novelty of the styles is far beyond what his peers can match. He told people that in the spring of 1933, the new clothes worn by the general actresses in Hollywood will pay more attention to the radiance in all directions. Each of them will buy some shiny things to decorate around the new clothes, and bronze will be the most popular color. Venetian gold coins will be fully decorated on shawls and vests. There is also a new type of clothing, that is, each scarf will be decorated with a safety pin made of silver or tin. Sure enough, the new clothes that this clothing maker said have now all been realized.</p>
<h3>Al Jolson Drags Wife to Set</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Al Jolson's wife, Ruby Holer, once appeared on the screen. Now, Al Jolson has forcibly dragged her to Hollywood to join the screen work. Ruby Holer refused to comply with his wishes, so she reluctantly shot a "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum," but unexpectedly, the results were excellent after working for a few days. It is said that she has decided to continue to stay in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>Film Novel State Fair</h3>
<p>— Huijun</p>
<p>Starring: Janet Gaynor, Will Rogers, Lew Ayres, Sally Eilers</p>
<p>The moonlight shines on the dim and rugged road, and the breeze waves the delicate rice branches by the road.</p>
<p>Alber drove his light Ford truck to the fair. Beside him sat his melancholy Melissa. Between her fat pig-like legs were placed the boxes containing her homemade preserves and meat fillings, which she was preparing to enter in the competition. Abel and Melissa's children, Maggie and Wayne, sat behind them. The remaining space was occupied by the huge wooden pen, in which Abel's white pig, Blue Boy, in which he had great hopes, was safely housed. He was convinced that it would be selected as the first, and had even bet five dollars with the grocer.</p>
<p>It was a hundred li to the fair, and for fear that the heat of the day would affect Blue Boy's health, they set off late in the evening. The road was too rugged, the car shook, and Blue Boy grunted resentfully.</p>
<p>Wayne looked up at the twinkling stars, imagining aimlessly in his hometown, where there was his lover, Irene, whom he might marry in the future. Ahead was the fair, full of refreshing joy. He thought of the ring toss stall he had been to last year. With a conceited sneer, he thought of how he had practiced with his mother's embroidery hoop. This year he was going to try again.</p>
<p>Beside Wayne, Maggie gazed at the silvery moon, a smile on her face. She sighed, she dreamed, as emotionless as her brother. She thought of Harley? Wasn't he very sincere when he came to see her off? He had proposed to her, enthusiastically talking about how they would enjoy their honeymoon. She had indeed been mesmerized by him.</p>
<p>Abel, how could he not be thinking? But his goal was that Blue Boy would be sure to win the championship and that no unfortunate event would happen. The grocer had warned him of the prevalence of cholera. Perhaps it would be unfavorable to Blue Boy, as well as the frivolous men and women who specialized in slandering and seducing the children of wealthy farmers. In the end, he laughed at himself. Nothing unfortunate was likely to happen.</p>
