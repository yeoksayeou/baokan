<h3>石井遊說羅斯福内幕</h3>
<p>日本拉攏美國擬訂</p>
<p>美日和平維持條約</p>
<p>内田將訓令出淵探詢美政府意見</p>
<p>引用威爾遜時代普萊安案爲藍本</p>
<p>美政府之否認</p>
<p>（華盛頓）白宫未聞美日間有任何公斷條約或諒解之消息、據負責方面聲稱、羅斯福總統與日代表石井間所獲之諒解、並未包括一種公斷條約在内、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）此間報紙載稱、日政府因羅斯福總統與日代表石井開談話之結果、不久將向美國提議開始賡續前有的兩國公斷條約之談判、或建議另行締結公斷與和解新約云（十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）印度對於日本棉布雖徵以重稅、但今日證劵市塲竟呈漲風價格高起一磅音至十二磅音不等聞此暴漲原因、爲美日公斷條約之將開議、及美國通貨膨脹後之商業勃興、（十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）内田外相自退出國聯以後、則採各個擊破之戰術爲新外交策略、五月上旬曾命出淵大使向美國提議美日公斷條約、斯時美國以新政府就任匆匆、應付金融甚忙、不能顧及外交交涉、故暫作罷論、石井代表赴美當時、内田外相再囑石井向羅斯福提議、羅斯福表示美政府並不反對、但未入具體交涉、内田外相爲欲安頓國内民心起見、再電出淵大使積極敦促美國政府、進行新條約云、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）内田外相認爲此時訂立日美和平維持條約非常適當、内定日内對出淵駐美大使發重要訓電、先探詢美政府之意向、然後爲或種之正式提案、此美日新和平條約問題、蓋發端於五月廿六日石井全權在白宫會見羅斯福大統領時、石井子以個人之意見、謂「日美間之安定、最近益增緊密外間反有日美開戰之說、殊爲遺憾、爲掃除兩國間之敵對感情起見余意日美兩國間訂立和平維持條約、實爲必要、且極台時宜、其辦法或使一九二八年以來已失効力之日美仲裁裁判條約復活、或如最近日本荷蘭間所訂立之協定及仲裁裁判條約、或訂立如普萊安之維持條約案、尊意如何、」當時美大統領雖避免即答、然無反對之理由觀其情形、似考慮石井子之提案、内田外相因此决提議訂立和平條約、（十日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）爲日美和平維持條約案之基準、而引用之普萊安案即一九一三年、威爾遜政府之國務卿普萊安、曾向各國提出者、當時日本因加州土地法案問題、對美國議論沸騰、故加拒絕其槪要如下、（一）兩國間發生紛爭、不問性質如何、交審查委員會審議、原則上締約國盡一切之外交手叚後、始交審查、（二）審查委員會兩國間常設之、（三）審查手續、準用海牙條約第三章之規定、原則上一年以内審查完畢、提出報吿、（四）對審查結果之措置、雖爲當事國之自由、然在未提出報吿以前、當事國不得布吿宣戰或開戰（、五）該條約之有效期間爲五年、一方通吿廢棄時、通吿後十二個月間、依然有効等、外務省此外雖考慮日美仲裁裁制條約之復活、然日美兩國均加入國際司法裁判所、故無復活之理、（十日電通電）</p>
<p>駐美日使易人</p>
<h3>松方代出淵</h3>
<p>（東京）外務省考慮駐美大使出淵勝治辭職後之繼任人選、最近决定起用松方幸次郎、按松方爲已故松方公爵之第三子、留學英法美各大學、曾任内閣總理大臣秘書官、（十日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日報載大使出淵、即將奉召回國、繼任者以前川崎造船廠廠長松方、呼聲最高、聞日政府曾欲以此職予出席國聯大會之日代表松岡、但彼已拒絕接受此命、按松方現年六十八歲、爲日本商界中有名之人物、爲日本實行八小時工作時間之第一人、曾游歷歐美等國云、十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省内定任命松方幸次郎氏爲駐美大使、現與松方交涉、政府由民間實業家中選拔大使、係近來稀有之事、頗即惹起各方面注目、（十日日聯電）</p>
<p>羅斯福贊同四强公約</p>
<h3>謂足促進國際會議成功</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美總統對於四强公約發一聲明、表示完全贊同謂此約　可使亟謀日内瓦倫敦兩會成功者得一新鼓勵、按四强公約雖不求美國實在參加、但簽約國執政僉謂美國對於此約精神上之合作、是所願望意相墨索里尼曾在下院演說稱、美國之合作、爲此約完全成功之要素、而今日美總統之聲明、即所以答復意相云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）棉商今晨開會决議贊助日本棉紡同業會抵制印度原棉之决議、按棉紡同業會於兩日前在大阪開緊急會議商定上項决議、將提交六月十三日全體會議核奪、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（大阪）日本棉商聯合會會長爲求减少因日本棉紡家抵制印棉所受損失計、已請棉紡同業會對棉商聯合會會員現存之印棉、及六月八日以前所定未到之貨、勿加抵制、棉紡同業會暫不作覆、將以該問題交下星期二日大會討論、日本印棉交易、今日完全停頓、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本抵制印度棉花之决議、又不得不使各紗廠縮短其紡紗工作、此項縮短工作率之决定因其對於棉紗行亦有重大直接影響、頗爲棉紗業商人所注目、今次抵制印棉結果所受損失、應由各廠平等負担、故其决定縮短工作率之方法、將去年間日產棉布輸出印度市塲之數、以現在月產棉紗數二十五萬包爲標準、換算棉紗數、作爲每月平均三萬七千包、而考慮此棉紗因抵制印棉所受影響、决定縮短工作率百分之十或百分之五、（十日日聯電）</p>
<p>（孟買）日本駐孟買領事、以爲英國對日本棉織物之進口提高關稅、足以妨害日英外交關係之協調云、日本方面最近决議抵制印度棉花原料一舉實予棉業以打擊、據日本熟悉棉業情形者所見、日英兩國之經濟爭鬭不能持久、因美棉較印棉爲貴日本不能採購之也、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）外務省十日關於日英關係非公式發表如次聲明、日本退出國聯後之外交方針、如日皇於三月二十七日詔書所闡明、始終與列國繼續親善關係、日政府雖無離英親美等意思、然占有世界人口四分之一之英國、對於日貨課以禁止輸入的關稅、而停止供給工業原料於日本、則日本因此爲生死問題、當然要考慮相當對策、日本與各國親善之方針决無變動、然如英國不棄今日之經濟政策、則將來世界通商之破綻、英國當負重大責任、日本切望英國在此時際研究有效辦法、以免損害日英兩國感情（十日日聯社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>邊情緊急</h3>
<p>古人言「日蹙國百里。」然試觀今日。自九一八以來一年又九個月之間。不幾日蹙國五千里耶而事實上之可懼。尚不止此也。</p>
<p>新疆自金樹仁出走。劉文龍盛世才以省府委員被推而組織臨時政府。中央所指派之大員。已起程赴新。是新疆問題。可暫告一段落。西顧之憂。或可稍減矣。然吾人細按事實。恐不如是簡單。全新疆人口雖不過三百萬而政治關係。則甚複雜。第一。有國際的衝突存乎其間。新疆西北緊隣蘇聯土西鐵道成功之後。中亞細亞工業化之計劃。將次第見諸實施。則新疆在地理上關係。勢必近於蘇而遠於我中國也况中亞細亞之纏回。與新省纏回一脈相通。宗敎旣同。語言無隔。其對宗主國之向心力能否不致移動殊難預測我國而欲完全統率新疆。大有鞭長莫及之勢。益以英帝國「經濟聯盟。」努力於團結其海外殖民地。其對印政策。旣趨積極。於新疆南部。豈肯輕易放鬆。蘇聯又與之不兩立。處此兩雄相爭之際。新疆地方廣大。雖超過五百三十六萬五千方里。但以經濟力及組織力皆極落後。自無能力以與强隣週。旋假令英蘇衝突旦暴發。如日俄在東北故事。則我將何以應付之耶。第二。政治不良。實爲厲階。溯自楊增新金樹仁秉政以來。匪特官府紊亂。私賂盛行。且其虐殺人民。兒戲人命。較之古代暴君殆有過之。近年西風東漸。回回之留學蘇聯者各部皆有。其離新疆也。有所爲而去。其師新疆也。有所圖而來。新省回民旣受壓迫其不起而反抗者幾希矣。是故我國控制新省之無策。不在宗敎信仰之不同。而在政治設施之不善也。政治關係如不立圖改善。竊恐邊禍愈深。國事亦愈不可收拾矣。</p>
<p>南接新境之西藏。數月之前。曾一度轟傳藏兵將東侵川康。北掠靑海。嗣乃𨵙然毫無所聞。未見有積極變化者。蓋以川省二劉交訌。其混戰之汹汹情勢。較藏兵侵入爲追切。川戰之血。有以掩蔽藏邊之緊急情報也。頃者達賴已窺破西康因劉鄧混戰。而防務空虚。故又擬乘機而入。意在渡金沙而東。據巴塘裏塘。而實現其「大西藏」之企圖。是則川省軍閥歷年内訌。致强鄰啓窺伺之心。遠人懷去國之志。竊恐康藏三百八十萬方里之地域。又將不免繼東三省之後而危如累卵矣。</p>
<p>更有甚者。津東及沿長城一帶之戰爭。表面雖已吿一段落。然日軍尚未撤退。平津附近伏莽正多。是否即能平安渡過難關。尚屬疑問。而日人更本其預定政策。對在停戰協定中并無明白規定之察哈爾。可以進退自如。今日僞軍劉桂堂部及一部分日本騎兵。已由多倫襲擊沽源。勢將越獨石口以扼張家口。馮玉祥氏雖有志抗日。但兵不過數萬。縱使臨時收羅窳敗之槍枝。集合未經訓練之部隊。又烏足以當强敵。矧察省地瘠民窮近年復苦於兵匪一般社會之財力。苛索殆盡。欲以應敵。斷難倖勝矣。</p>
<p>綜上三者。皆我中華民國當前之巨患。且與日具深。設不能積極補救者。匪特邊疆不保。内地亦將受嚴重之影響。自救之道。首在克服當前人事之矛盾。於短時期中。健全政治上之組織。俾内地得復安寗。然後用武力以鞏固邊陲。恢復失土。奮整個之國力。或可雪恥辱於將來也。</p>

天已微明’敵機又在天空出現’他們到處偵察’毫無忌憚’並隨時擲下燃燒彈和炸彈’使各處起火。」「我常常想到’這回淞滬之戰’倘如我們有了和敵人力量相等的空軍’我相信我們的戰績一定超出一般人的意料’不必講到炸燬他們的戰鬥艦和航空母艦’就是阻住他們的飛機使他們不敢在空中自由偵察自由擲彈也就够使我們佔優勢了’飛機對於一個沒有抵抗的敵人所發出的威力’眞是不可思議的大。」「此次戰役’給我一個極大的感觸’當日人的飛機向我們恣意擲彈時’牠們滿天亂飛得心應手絲毫無所顧忌。·····要對付飛機’在我們還沒有别的發明以前只有飛機自己’我們若有一半的飛機’’敵機便不能從容投彈我們若有同量的飛機’敵機便不敢輕　出動’我們若有優勢的飛機便可以操這次戰爭的勝算了’·····滬戰不是最後的對外戰爭飛機的效用將來愈大難道我們將於第一次領受了這樣嚴重痛苦的敎訓之後’再以同樣的眼睛看我們許多無抵抗的大都市和民衆受到第二次的損失麽？」從上述的翁將軍的叙述和感想中’我們已經可以知道日本飛機所給予我們的損失了。然而翁將軍說得好「滬戰並不是我們最後的對外戰爭呀。」這裏’我們對於日本航空的研究’就有非常的必要了！本書就正是應此一必要而作。本書係徐淵若先生參攷日本所出各種航空讀物’編著而成。全書分五章。第一章述日本航空之過去現在及將來’將日本對於航空努力之經過’作一全盤的叙述。從這裏我們可以知道日本航空事業的發展’還不過是近十幾年事’在歐戰以前’日本航空事業還很幼稚’但歐戰以後’他們以政府的努力’和人民共同的奮鬥’居然在短短十幾年中’奠下了軍事航空的基礎。現在日本的航空事業’比之歐美各國’雖然還是相差很遠’但以他們全國上下一致的努力’前途是未可限量。他們是在怎樣努力？關於這一點’本章有詳細的具體叙述。第二章泛述日本航空客觀的環境’指出日本在歐美列强大規模空軍壓迫下的危險地位’及其因此種壓迫而引起的對於空軍及防空設備加倍的努力。第三章述橫斷太平洋問題。據編者在自序裏說··「書中太平洋橫斷問題之所以另列專章者’因此問題在日本國内’卽三尺孩童’亦已有深刻的印象。彼邦奥論界’因橫斷問題一朝解决’將來日美間於經濟上及軍事上之關係’必更密切而緊張’故對於國民大聲疾呼’終於得到了極大的反應。所以這問題在日本的航空上’可以說是有極重要的意義」。日本對於這問題怎樣努力？其大聲疾呼得到了怎樣的反應？及其重要意義如何？本章皆有詳細介紹。第四章述日本之少年航空兵。少年航空兵’爲日本所獨有’世界各國’莫不予以最大興味之注意。本章詳述其訓練情形’極可　鏡。第五章爲雜錄’附述日本對於航空事業其他的設備’以及日本前年在大阪及　　門司北九海的兩次防空演習情形’極　趣味。總之爲要明瞭日本空軍的實力’及其在世界空軍中所佔的地位’以及我們對於　　　該怎樣努力？　　　讀本書。</p>

<p>自由談推  豐之餘兩三月前’報上好像登過一條新聞’說有一個賣報的孩子’踏上電車的踏脚去取報錢’誤踹住了一個下來的客人的衣角’那人大怒’用力一推’孩子跌入車下’電車又剛剛走動’一時停不住’把孩子碾死了。推倒孩子的人’却早已不知所往。但衣角會被踹住’可見穿的是長衫’即使不是『高等華人』’總該是屬於上等的。我們在上海路上走’時常可以遇見兩種橫衝直撞’對於對面或前面的行人’决不稍讓的人物。一種是不用兩手’却只將直直的長脚’如入無人之境似的踏過來’倘不讓開’他競會踏在你的肚子或肩膀上。這是洋大人’都是『高等』的’沒有華人那樣上下的區别。一種就是　上兩條臂　’手掌向外’像　子的兩個鉗一樣·一路推過去’不管被推的人是跌在泥塘或火坑裏。這就是我們的同胞’然而『上等』的’他坐電車’要坐二等所改的三等車’他　報’要　專登黑幕的小報’他坐着看得嚥唾沬’但一走動’又是推。上車’進門’買票’寄信’他推；出門’下車’避禍’逃難’他又推。推得女人孩子踉踉蹌蹌’跌倒了’他就從活人上踏過’跌死了’他就從死屍上踏過’走出外面’用舌頭䑛䑛自已的厚嘴唇’什麽也不覺得。舊歷端午的一家戲塲裏’因爲一句失火的謠言’就又是推’把十多個力量未足的少年踏死了。死屍擺在空地上’據說去看的又有萬餘人’人山人海’又是推。推了的結果’是嘻開嘴巴’說道··『阿唷’好白相來希呀丨』住在上海’想不遇到推與踏’是不能的’而且這推與踏也還要廓在開去。要推倒一切下等華人中的幼弱者’要踏倒一切下等華人。這時就只剩了高等華人頌祝着丨『阿唷’好白相來希呀。爲保全文化起見’是雖然犧牲任何物質’也不應該顧惜的’丨這些物質有什麽重要性呢！』花鼓戲之起源  何如予嘗觀京戲『打花鼓』’又嘗讀綴白裘『花鼓』一劇’頗疑花鼓出自鳳陽’明初始有之。花鼓鳳陽歌云··說鳳陽’話鳳陽’鳳陽元是好地方。自從出了朱皇帝’十年倒有九年荒。大户人家賣田地’小户人家賣兒郎。惟有我家沒有得賣’肩背鑼鼓走街坊。按明初屢有饑荒’見於諸帝本紀。歌中所云’意謂當時鳳陽遭饑’貧苦之家’有兒女者出賣兒女’否則即打花鼓’乞食爲生也。聞今鳳陽城北門外三里許’田野間有碩大無比之大鐵鑊五。相傳昔遭兵燹’荒歉連年’皖北饑饉。明帝眷念民困’乃飭吏於此施粥賑災’鐵鑊即前時用以煑粥者。據云每一鑊粥足供五百人果腹’可見其容積之大。由是言之’明時鳳陽遭饑’至今尚有鐵證不磨也。茲再鈔『花鼓』中小曲一支··「仙花調」身背着花鼓’「凈持鑼跳上」「旦」手提着鑼。夫妻恩愛’並不離他。「合」咱也會唱歌’穿州過府’兩脚走如梭。逢人開口笑’宛轉接謳歌。「貼」風流子弟瞧着我’戲要塲中那怕人多’這是爲錢財沒奈何。「凈」咚咚搭鼓上長街’引動風流子弟來。「貼」看得他人心歡喜’銀錢銅子滾出來。此等花鼓女郎竟似吉普西Ｇｙｐｓｙ女人’以賣藝餬口於四方也。在湖南流行之花鼓戲曲有王三賣肉一種’其中花鼓大姐云··『家住鳳陽府’學得唱歌文。』又有婊子過關一種’其花鼓妓亦來自皖北’路過蕪湖’但未明言其爲鳳陽人耳。予以爲花鼓是否始於明初’鳳陽是否花鼓最初發生之地’斯固不無可疑··若僅謂自明以來’鳳陽即爲花鼓有名之產地’是則昭然可證也。又歐陽予倩於其『漢口的戲劇』一文論及花鼓。略謂宋朝有所謂迓腔戲’曲牌中亦有所謂村裏迓鼓’花鼓戲大約即爲迓腔戲之遺’亦未可知。予以爲宋時但有訝鼓戲’歐陽所謂訝腔’未知何出。續墨客揮犀卷七云··「王子醇初平煕河’邊陲寗靜。講武之暇’因敎軍士爲訝鼓戲’數年間遂盛行於世。其舉動舞裝之狀’與優人之詞’皆子醇初製也。成云子醇初與西人對陣’兵未交’子醇命軍士百餘人’裝爲訝鼓隊’繞出軍前’虜見皆愕眙’進兵奮擊’大破之。』以軍士裝訝鼓’以訝鼓破敵人’是戰争也’亦藝術也。王子醇洵可人也哉！又朱子語錄卷一百三十九云··「如舞訝鼓’其間男子婦人’僧道雜色’無所不有’但都是假的。」可知訝鼓創自北宋王子醇’南渡以後’流行益廣也。但今之花鼓是否訝鼓之遺’未易考定。予以爲宋時尚有所謂打夜胡’頗與今之地花鼓相似。地花鼓云者’不須舞臺’即於地上扮演之花鼓也。孟元老東京夢華錄云··『十二月’即有貧者三敎人’爲一火’裝婦人神鬼’敲鑼擊鼓’巡門乞錢’俗呼爲打夜胡。』雲麓漫鈔亦有打野胡一則’略謂歲將除’鄕人相率爲儺’俚語謂之打野胡。要而言之’花鼓之起源甚早’吾人可以假定者’打迓鼓’打夜胡’打花鼓’三者音相近’而事相類’殆因俚語之流轉’遂致一事三名今則通稱爲花鼓也。病床七日（續）  熊湘女士五月二十四日眞是出我意料之外’嫂嫂來了。她一個人帶了小孩’從幾千里外的故鄕來尋前哥。孟姜女萬里尋夫’嫂嫂也可算是千里尋夫了。人類眞是奇怪的’從前是漠不相關的人’一旦成了夫婦’竟會這麽痛癢與共起來。譬如我自己罷’從現在看來’明哥幾乎成了我自己的生命’而和我有骨肉之親的父母姊妹倒淡然起來。明哥去年生了一塲大病’我幾乎不顧性命的冒險相救’眼涙也不知流了多少’今年父親已臨危境’我却坦然度日’一點也感不到悲苦’這心理’眞使我覺得稀奇’我不知道在我心裏怎麽會生出這麽判然相異的兩種情感。論起來’我應該痛我的生父更甚於痛我的丈夫’然而’我不。這原因并不是父親對我不好。我把這疑問問明哥’他說··「因爲我們現在是利害相共的關係。人類一到利害相同’就會結合起來。」我和明哥果然是利害相共纔這麽戀愛的麽？靜哥從南京回來’順便帶來姐姐給我的信。姐姐責備我太不當心自己的身體’說我從死中逃出來還不知道。這種親切痛念之詞’很使我感動。不禁觸發我的身世之感。一個生命是如此脆弱’人生將有什麽憑藉呢？五月二十五日院中的規定是早上五時起床’　洗’吃粥’以後就隨意休息’或出去散步。今天是我入院的第七天’整天躺着’苦悶得很’起身以後’一個人到花園裏去瀏覽了一回’回來在甬道中來往徘徊。看見病房門口懸着探望病人的規則’那上面寫着··「頭等病房每日上午十時至下午五時’二等上午十一時至下午四時　三　下午三時至四時　　　　　　下’頭等探望的時間’每天七個鐘頭’二等五個鐘頭’三等却祇有兩個鐘頭。連探望也分出等級來’爲什麽不乾脆規定探望一次’納費若干呢？出多少錢就可探望多少時間’這眞是一寸光陰一寸金了。聽說社會祗有兩個階級’醫院中却有了三個’這算是醫院比社會前進罷？窮人的自由無論何時何地都是有限度的。明哥下午來’說嫂嫂等我出院後’到我們家裏來住。我决計明天出院。昨天來的人今天又出去了。現在這房中祇剩下我一個人。（完）紅蘿蔔鬚  Jules　Kenaro作林取譯瑪狄爾德（續）「這兩個東西多蠢啊！他們竟以爲是眞的呢！」「第一我並沒有紅臉’」紅蘿蔔鬚說’「其次你儘管冷笑好了’祇要媽媽應允的話’你是不能阻止我和瑪狄爾德結婚的。」可是就在這時候’媽媽親自來回答她是不應允的。她把牧塲的栅門推開。她走進牧塲’後面跟着報吿消息的姐姐愛勒絲丁。當她經過籬邊的時候’她折下了一條荆棘’她把葉子除掉而把刺留下。她一直走來’好像暴風雨一般地無法避免。「當心你們的頭頂啊’」大哥菲利克斯說。他逃到牧塲的儘頭去子。他把身子藏得好好的’還可以看着鷙閙··紅蘿蔔鬚是從來不逃的。平常他雖然怯懦’但他寗願使得事情早點了結’今天呢’他却覺得勇敢起來了。瑪狄爾德渾身戰抖着’像寡婦一般哭着’抽抽噎噎的。紅蘿蔔鬚丨不要害怕。我曉得媽媽的脾氣的··他祇會處罰我一個人。我可以擔受一切。瑪狄爾德丨對啦’可是你的媽媽會把這事吿訴我的媽媽’而我的媽媽會打我的。紅蘿蔔鬚丨這不是打’這是糾正啊；人家都說這是糾正’就像糾正我們假期中的課一樣。她糾正你嗎’你的媽媽？瑪狄爾德丨有時糾正的；這看情形怎樣··紅蘿蔔鬚丨至於我呢’那是每次一定要被糾正的。瑪狄爾德丨可是我並沒有犯什麽事。紅蘿蔔鬚丨這沒有什麽要緊的。當心啦！雷辟克家的走近了。她知道他們逃不掉。她儘有餘裕。她把脚步放慢了。她那樣緊緊的逼近去’囚而姐兒愛勒絲丁恐怕反擊到自己身上來’遠遠的停留在活動範圍的外邊。紅蘿蔔鬚一動也不動的立在他那哭得更利害的「女人」的前面。野牡丹蔓上的白花已經亂得一團糟。雷辟克家的把荆條舉起’預備往下抽。紅蘿蔔鬚面色蒼白’把兩臂义放在胸前’頸根微低着’他還沒有嘗到荆條’他的腰已火辣辣的’他的腿已感着痛楚了’他還驕傲地呌說··「這有什麽要緊呢’不過玩玩罷了！」保險箱第二天’紅蘿蔔鬚遇着瑪狄爾德的時候’她對他說··「你的媽媽跑來把那事通通吿訴我的媽媽了’我被痛打了一頓屁股。你呢？」紅蘿蔔鬚丨我嗎’我已記不起來了。但你實在被打得寃枉’我們並沒在做什麽壞事。瑪狄爾德丨是啦’我們决沒有做什麽壞事。紅蘿蔔鬚丨我現在得向你確實聲明；當我昨天對你說我將來一定要和你結婚的時候’我並不是說着玩的。瑪狄爾德丨我也一樣’我將來一定要和你結婚的。紅蘿蔔鬚丨因爲你貧而我富的緣故’我本來可以瞧你不起的’可是你不必擔心’我是敬重你的。瑪狄爾德丨你究竟富到了什麽程度’紅蘿蔔鬚？紅蘿蔔鬚丨我的爹媽至少有一百萬佛郎。瑪狄爾德丨一百萬究竟有多少？紅蘿蔔鬚丨這是狠多的；那些一百萬的富翁是永遠用不完他們的錢的。瑪狄爾德丨我的爹媽却常常因爲沒有一文而呌苦着呢。紅蘿蔔鬚丨啊！我的爹媽也是一樣的。每個人都呌苦着好引起别人的憐惜’而使一班嫉妒者高興。但我知道我們家裏是有錢的’每個月的第一天’爸爸要獨自一個人在他的房間裏躭擱一會兒。我聽到他用鑰匙開着保險箱的轢音。那轢音正像晚邊的蛙鳴。爸爸說出一個字之後丨那個字除掉他和我以外是沒有任何人知道的。不論是我的媽媽’我的哥哥’我的姐姐’他們全不知道丨保險箱的門便開開了。爸爸從那裏面拿出一些錢來送到廚房的桌上。他不說什麽’他祇把錢弄得響’使在竈上埋頭工作的媽媽知道罷了。爸爸出去了。媽媽便回轉身來連忙把錢收起。每個月都是這樣的’並且許多時候以來便是這樣的’這可證明那保險箱裏面有着一百萬佛郎。（未完）</p>

<p>西席地密爾在好萊塢的地位’和以往的德國大導演馮史都漢相同。即埀老的史都漢氏亦佩服西席地密爾的手腕靈活。然而這種種的嘉奬僅爲藝術上所得到的。西席地密爾除了這種藝術上的稱奬之外’還受到了一種特别的嘉奬’這種嘉獎是好萊塢任何人所沒有受到過’是一種宗敎上的褒賫。當西席地密寗爾導演一部「萬王之王」的時候’希臘的雅典敎堂中曾賜西席地密爾爲名譽主敎’因爲在這一部片子之中’雅典的宗敎家認他有發揚宗敎的功勳’所以加以嘉奬。後來希臘敎會中人又看了「羅宫春色」一片’片中男女老幼許多敎徒’不爲威武所屈’從容就義時’一邊仍高唱聖歌’認作無上光榮的事’並指示耶敎在歐洲之所以獨尊的緣由。因爲這種種’所以希臘的正宗派敎堂中的許多主敎决定再贈給西席地密爾一種奬褒。結果議定給以宗敎上最光耀的賜與’就是拿西席地密爾的名字刻入聖墓中的聖碑上’將來西席地密爾亦能載於希臘聖籍之中。依照了宗敎上的規例’凡姓名能列入聖墓中碑上的人’是不世之榮的人物。如果不是替敎務上盡力的人决受不到這樣榮典的。所以西席地密爾驟然受到了這樣的褒賚’可謂非同小可’驚動了歐美的影界中人物。希臘正宗派敎堂拿西席地密爾姓各列入聖碑的消息初到美洲時’西席地密爾自己也不敢深信’及至希臘正式的消息傳到美洲後’始知所傳不訛’好萊塢的人特向西席地密爾道賀。派拉蒙公司在希臘正宗派敎堂頒佈正式消息到達美國的第二天’在好萊塢的大敎堂中舉行禮拜’西席地密爾就榮膺了這光榮的褒賫。影片談評國泰短片總評  凌鶴前言仔細想來’記得中國的「國難」確實還未烟消火滅’不過在這危迫的時局中’太平景象却仍然存在’而一般熱心的電影鑒賞家’特别是對於勞萊哈台的駕臨「國泰」民安的上海’自然是興致勃發’不勝歡迎之至。於是昨天的國泰座吿客滿’濟濟一堂’皆大歡喜。如此盛况’除「大飯店」之外’能有幾次呢？（迅速結婚一場胡鬧）第一個短片是却利卓氏主演的「迅速結婚」（Ｃｈａｒｌｉｅ　Ｃｈａｓｅ　ｉｎ　２Ｔｅｅｌ　Ｃｏｍｅｄｙ）全篇一律’熱鬧異常’先吃飯’偷偷摸摸’鬼鬼祟祟。後坐車’滿頭滿面’一塌胡塗’打幾架’跌幾交’大鬧一塲’終於勝利。若有人說這不免淺薄庸俗’那末此君便不懂得滑稽製片家製造滑稽片的眞理了。滑稽影片原來如此。（花花綠綠肉感迷人）其次爲「好萊塢之一夕」（Ｈｏｌｌｙｗｏｏｄ　Ｐｒｅｍｉｅｒｅ）。這是一部令人迷醉的花花綠綠的五彩歌舞片。成羣的少女’炫耀着她們的玉臂纖腰’歌喉婉轉’舞態輕盈’多少靑年男子’爲了她們惝恍迷離。此片也誇耀着資本主義的榮華’暴露着紳士太太們的沒落。（勞萊哈台活見鬼了）最後一片’不消說是二位丑角泰斗的壓軸戲了。他們二位在河沿上坐着釣魚’說說笑笑。旣而在狂風暴雨之夜’爲了一筆巨欵而不惜心驚胆戰的在一華貴的臥房房中受着鬼的恐怖’疑鬼疑神’於是他們大呌大跳’大哭大笑。最後是假神假鬼’大鬧一場’活見鬼「打出手」’幸而是一場噩夢。每次都是一樣’這二位笑匠仁兄的作品’常是給觀衆們笑笑而已’不會有絲毫回味。然而這正是他們的作風’他們所以能夠賺錢’所以能夠成爲明星’其原因也就在此。（結尾）看了以上的幾部短片’跟着大家大笑一場’再加上迷人的肉感’這次花錢’到底値得。然而能使我滿意的’還是那些關於昆虫的畫面’不僅是攝影甚爲美麗’而且還多得了不少昆虫的學識。這樣一來’我總覺得很高興了。蕭伯納也是影迷  炳以幽默聞名的諷剌作家蕭伯納氏’這次作環遊世界之壯舉’到美國時’忽然老興勃發’而遊好萊塢’好萊塢的人們聞訊’預備着一見蕭伯納的丰采’那天蕭伯納到了好萊塢’被一大羣的女明星們’羣雌粥粥的圍住了一個銀絲似的白髮老翁’煞是好看’而蕭伯納在一羣女星之中’竟失却其素來持以諷刺人家的妙舌’不作一語’弄得手足無措’後來女明星之中推派了一位口才老練的曼琳但娓絲做代表’一一介紹當地情形’才使蕭伯納談起話來了’蕭伯納參觀了幾家影片公司攝影塲之後’在好萊塢的一條著名的林蔭路Ｂｏｕｌｅｖａｒｄ上漫步’且走且瞧’一面’同曼琳但娓絲及另外幾個好萊塢的代表談話’在林蔭路上’對面來了瑙瑪柴美琪’蕭伯納說··「這是瑙瑪柴美琪呀！」旁邊有一人隨口答了一聲「不是」’蕭伯納說··「那麽是葛洛里史橫生」’柴美琪同史橫生面貎是差不多的’所以好萊塢的人們都說蕭伯納很熟悉’大槪他也是一個電影迷呢！環球公司誘掖後進  言重好萊塢通訊’環球影片公司爲誘掖後進及補充電影人材起見’决定從訓練新進着手。業已與洛山磯中學商妥入學辦法。該校主敎决特設臨時班於本月開始授課。並於每星期六特别講授關於此項男女學生之一切費用’均由環球公司負擔。而在三個月之學期終了之後’從中選取四五十人簽訂合同。惟在此就學期内’環球公司得以將該學生充作臨時演員或要角云。該公司主事名導演卡爾勒梅爾說他希望能於明年環球出品之中介紹三四十位新人物’查該班之課程除戲劇外’尚包括試演’化裝’攝演及發音各科云。「掙扎」中的新曲  龍子天一公司有聲新片「掙扎’」是陳玉梅繼「生機」後的作品’由裘芑香導演’劉炳華’魏鵬飛’合演’劇情以農村做背景’一洗描寫都市生活之窠臼’該片昨日已全部拍竣’現正從事翦接工作。該片本名「黃昏’」片中有「黃昏曲」一支’係高天棲作歌’馬陋芬製譜’唱者爲主角陳玉梅’現在把歌詞錄在下面··黃昏’靜悄悄’樹枝上睡着小鳥’搖籃裏睡着寶寶。我們一天忙到晚’此時也該休息了！甜甜蜜蜜’談談笑笑’等到早晨’走上光明大道。但是黑暗把我們緊緊擁抱’啊！長夜漫漫’問何時方才天曉？一張諷刺美國的蘇俄新片  言重盻望了好久的蘇俄新片『興隆』Ｐｒｏｓｐｅｒｉｔｙ是一張描寫美國生活的’業已在俄國公演了’這是對抗好萊塢反蘇俄的影片。所以在意識上完全是莫斯科的一種『復仇』。劇情是如此。主角是一個土豪’當然又是資本家’和一個共產黨員。這土豪想壟斷一種貿易’而這共產黨員則想阻撓他的計劃。該劇的重心是土豪履次想謀害這共產黨員’幾度雇了刺客去謀刺他’但始終沒有成功。最後’刺客們等候在一家地氈舖附近想襲擊他’可是又吿失敗。原來忽然在無線電中聽到了他們交易所已破產的消息。這土豪就此自殺’他的女友摧了珠寳衣飾遠走了。就這樣完結。好萊塢電影劇本作家之不景氣  明德自從世界不景氣潮波及好萊塢後’公司縮薪’明星吿退’鬧得烏烟瘴氣；因此而一般寫電影劇本的作家’也大家影響了。好萊塢各大公司’現在决定對於收買電影劇本’大行削價；所以譬如以前買進「八點鐘的晚餐」Ｄｉｎｎｅｒ　ａｔ　Ｅｉｇｈｔ’和「人生之圖樣」Ｄｅｓｉｇｎ　ｆｏｒ　Ｌｉｖｉｎｇ兩片之高價’將成爲一件過去的事情了。往年各電影公司’專向各雜誌收買其中登載的故事’以做材料’其一年前之最低價格爲五千金元’但今年即最高價格亦只二千而已。各公司因爲那些電影劇本作家’討價太昂’以前都採用他們的作品的’現在都不去領敎了’只打算到書堆裏去掏舊貨’可以價廉物美。在最近數月内’只拍拉蒙一家作成了那些作家們幾筆生意’所費只二千元一部’成竟二千元亦不到而已。據說這幾篇東西’在從前’都非五千元一部莫辦的。至於其他的各公司呢’都一致的採取了削價政策。於是這些作家們回想當年’大有「今非昔比」之感了。電影小說女性之光Ｍａｅｄｃｈｅｎ　ｉｎ　Ｕｎｉｆｏｒｍ（六）  欣俯日耳曼影片公司出品全班女演員聯合主演曼尼拉自從來到這裏以後’除掉裴柏以外’好像整個的世界都是很慘酷的。但是’現在居然有一線的光明了。爲什麽呢？原來校長的生日快到了！校長生日’當然是學校裏一椿大事。校中預備在這天開會慶祝’由學生們表演話劇。曼尼拉被配在這本戲裏’担任主角。這是多末僥倖呀！因爲曼尼拉有一個朋友’竟爲了一封私信’敎員還取消她的演員資格。可見得演員不是人人可做’何况曼尼拉還是担任主角呢。在練習表演期中’她的態度’完全變成一函非常快樂的姑娘了。但是她並不是因爲能夠參加表演而快樂。她想’機會到了’這千載一時的機會到了。她將在這個戲劇裏’把隱藏已久的熱情’發洩出來。好呌裴柏知道她是一個渴望着愛和慈的靑年’而在這樣個個充滿着死氣的地方’好像沒有一個人瞭解她的心思’和懂得什麽呌做愛情的’所以她一天到晚唸着··「我　使裴柏快樂一下了！我要使裴柏快樂一下了」！登台的那一天’曼尼拉扮演一個穿着軍裝的靑年男子’向着一位女郎求愛。這本是她心裏所念念不忘的事情’表演起來’當然是十二分眞切。她把平日所濳伏着的情绪’一古腦兒都借着劇中替身’發揮出來。台下圍坐着的敎員和同學’一個個都鼓掌　贊；但是曼尼拉都不去注意’她祇把眼風送到那充滿着笑容的裴柏臉孔上去’心裏想着··「裴柏啊！親愛的裴柏啊！你能了解我的心嗎」？這樣一來’她的心裏好像有一種說不出的快樂似的。表演完畢了！那許多學生們’都聚在大禮堂上’喝着甜美的酒’唱着快樂的歌’好像囚犯遇着大赦了。曼尼拉’不用說是最快樂的一個’她喝了一杯’再來一杯。酒’本是興奮的東西。於是她的熱情’遂無法抑制’竟毫無忌憚的奔放出來了。她挺着胸’楊着手’跑到講台上去的大聲呼喊道··「各位’我快樂極了！我來吿訴你們一件秘密的事情好嗎？她給我東西呢。這件襯衫’是她給我的呀」！一班同學’也不知道是怎麽一回事’有兩個插口問道··「誰啊」？「誰？就是裴柏女士呀！她愛我’她送東西給我！我還怕什麽呢······」曼尼拉把兩手高高舉起’這樣滔滔不絕的說着。（未完）</p>

In recent days, several trains carrying Japanese and "Manchu" troops have passed through Qinhuangdao and headed towards Shanhaiguan.

Japanese here admit that Chinese troops have completely retreated behind the lines stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, except for an occasional crossing of the line once or twice. However, Japanese aircraft are still conducting daily reconnaissance of the line, penetrating 20 miles to Beiping, thus arousing anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese people.

<h3>Inside Story of Ishii's Lobbying of Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Japan Plots to Draw the United States In</p>
<p>Drafting a US-Japan Treaty of Peace and Maintenance</p>
<p>Uchida Will Instruct Debuchi to Explore US Government's Views</p>
<p>Using the Bryan Plan from the Wilson Era as a Model</p>
<p>The US Government's Denial</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House has not heard of any arbitration treaty or understanding between the US and Japan. According to responsible sources, the understanding reached between President Roosevelt and Japanese representative Ishii did not include an arbitration treaty. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Local newspapers reported that, as a result of the talks between President Roosevelt and Japanese representative Ishii, the Japanese government will soon propose to the United States to begin negotiations to continue the existing arbitration treaty between the two countries, or suggest concluding a new treaty of arbitration and reconciliation. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although India has imposed heavy taxes on Japanese cotton cloth, the stock market today showed an upward trend, with prices rising to 12 British pounds per pound. It is said that the reason for this surge is the upcoming negotiation of the US-Japan arbitration treaty and the commercial boom following US inflation. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida, since withdrawing from the League of Nations, has adopted a "divide and conquer" tactic as a new diplomatic strategy. In early May, he instructed Ambassador Debuchi to propose a US-Japan arbitration treaty to the United States. At that time, the United States was preoccupied with financial matters due to the new government taking office and could not attend to diplomatic negotiations, so the matter was temporarily suspended. When Representative Ishii went to the United States, Foreign Minister Uchida again instructed Ishii to propose the matter to Roosevelt. Roosevelt indicated that the US government did not object, but did not enter into concrete negotiations. Foreign Minister Uchida, in order to reassure domestic public opinion, telegraphed Ambassador Debuchi again to actively urge the US government to proceed with the new treaty. (10th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida believes that it is very appropriate to conclude a US-Japan Treaty of Peace and Maintenance at this time, and has internally decided to send an important cable to Ambassador Debuchi in the United States within days, first to explore the intentions of the US government and then to make a formal proposal of some kind. This issue of a new US-Japan peace treaty originated on May 26 when Plenipotentiary Ishii met with President Roosevelt at the White House. Ishii stated his personal opinion, saying, "The stability between the US and Japan has recently become increasingly close. However, there are rumors of a US-Japan war, which is regrettable. In order to eliminate the hostile sentiments between the two countries, I believe it is necessary and timely for the US and Japan to conclude a Treaty of Peace and Maintenance. The method could be to revive the US-Japan Arbitration Treaty that has been ineffective since 1928, or to conclude an agreement and arbitration treaty like the one recently concluded between Japan and the Netherlands, or to conclude a treaty of maintenance like the Bryan Plan. What is your opinion?" At that time, the US President avoided giving an immediate answer, but his situation did not seem to warrant an objection and he seemed to be considering Ishii's proposal. Foreign Minister Uchida therefore decided to propose the conclusion of a peace treaty. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Bryan Plan, which is used as the basis for the US-Japan Treaty of Peace and Maintenance, is the one proposed to various countries by Bryan, the Secretary of State of the Wilson administration in 1913. At that time, Japan rejected it due to the California land law issue, which caused heated debate in the United States. Its general outline is as follows: (1) If a dispute arises between the two countries, regardless of its nature, it will be submitted to a review committee for deliberation. In principle, the contracting states shall exhaust all diplomatic means before submitting it for review. (2) The review committee shall be a permanent one between the two countries. (3) The review procedure shall follow the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Hague Treaty. In principle, the review shall be completed within one year and a report submitted. (4) The measures taken as a result of the review shall be the free choice of the parties concerned, but the parties concerned shall not declare war or start war before the report is submitted. (5) The treaty shall be valid for five years, and if one party gives notice of termination, it shall remain valid for twelve months after the notice. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also considered the revival of the US-Japan Arbitration and Restriction Treaty, but since both the US and Japan have joined the International Court of Justice, there is no reason to revive it.

<p>Replacement of Japanese Ambassador to the US</p>
<h3>Matsukata Replaces Debuchi</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering candidates to succeed Katsuji Debuchi after his resignation as Ambassador to the United States, and has recently decided to appoint Kojiro Matsukata. Matsukata is the third son of the late Duke Matsukata, and studied at universities in England, France, and the United States. He served as secretary to the Prime Minister. (10th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's newspapers report that Ambassador Debuchi will soon be summoned back home, and the most popular candidate to succeed him is former Kawasaki Shipyard President Matsukata. It is said that the Japanese government wanted to give this position to Japanese representative Matsuoka, who attended the League of Nations General Assembly, but he has refused to accept this appointment. Matsukata is 68 years old and is a famous figure in the Japanese business world. He was the first person in Japan to implement an eight-hour work day and has traveled to Europe and the United States. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has internally decided to appoint Kojiro Matsukata as Ambassador to the United States, and is currently negotiating with Matsukata. The government's selection of an ambassador from the private sector is a rare event in recent times and has attracted attention from all quarters. (10th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Roosevelt Endorses the Four-Power Pact</p>
<h3>Says it will Promote the Success of International Conferences</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US President issued a statement regarding the Four-Power Pact, expressing full support, saying that this pact can give new encouragement to those who are seeking the success of the Geneva and London Conferences in the near future. Although the Four-Power Pact does not seek the actual participation of the United States, the heads of the signatory countries all stated that the United States' spiritual cooperation in this pact is desired. Mussolini said in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies that the cooperation of the United States is an essential element for the complete success of this pact, and today's statement by the US President is a response to Mussolini.

<h3>Tensions Rise in Japan After Start of Anglo-Japanese Trade War</h3>
<p>Trading in Indian Cotton Comes to a Complete Standstill</p>
<p>Spinning Mills Reduce Work by 10 Percent</p>
<p>Delegates to be Sent to India for Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exporters Association, following the Cotton Merchants Association, also endorsed the resolution of the Japan Cotton Spinners Association to boycott Indian cotton. Finance Minister Takahashi told someone today about the need to start negotiations with India on trade issues as soon as possible, because the 1904 India-Japan trade agreement will be abolished in October. Takahashi said that if negotiations fail, retaliatory tariffs will be unavoidable. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cotton Merchants Association held a meeting this morning and decided to support the resolution of the Japan Cotton Spinners Association to boycott Indian raw cotton. The Cotton Spinners Association made the above resolution at an emergency meeting held in Osaka two days ago and will submit it to the general meeting on June 13 for approval. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Osaka) In order to reduce the losses caused by the Japanese cotton spinners' boycott of Indian cotton, the president of the Japan Cotton Merchants Association has requested that the Cotton Spinners Association not boycott the Indian cotton currently held by members of the Cotton Merchants Association and the goods that have been ordered before June 8 but have not yet arrived. The Cotton Spinners Association has not yet replied and will submit the issue to the general meeting next Tuesday for discussion. Trading in Japanese and Indian cotton has come to a complete standstill today. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The decision to boycott Indian cotton has also forced various spinning mills to shorten their spinning work. The decision on this reduction rate has a significant direct impact on cotton yarn trading and has attracted much attention from cotton yarn merchants. The losses resulting from this boycott of Indian cotton should be borne equally by each factory, so the method of deciding on the reduction rate will be based on the number of cotton fabrics exported to the Indian market last year, with the current monthly output of 250,000 bales of cotton yarn as the standard. Converting this to the number of cotton yarns, it will be considered an average of 37,000 bales per month, and considering the impact of this cotton yarn due to the boycott of Indian cotton, the decision will be to reduce the work rate by 10% or 5%. (10th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Mumbai) The Japanese Consul in Mumbai believes that the British government's raising of tariffs on imports of Japanese cotton textiles is sufficient to hinder the coordination of Anglo-Japanese diplomatic relations. The recent Japanese decision to boycott Indian cotton raw materials has dealt a blow to the cotton industry. According to those familiar with the cotton industry in Japan, the economic dispute between Britain and Japan cannot last long, because US cotton is more expensive than Indian cotton and Japan cannot purchase it.

<p>(Tokyo) Japan should send a representative to the Japan-India consultation proposed by the Commercial Officer of the Indian government. After the routine cabinet meeting on the 13th, the Japanese representative will rush to Simla, as the Japan-India consultation will be held there in early July. It was initially decided that Shintaro Kawashima, the former minister to Greece, would be the chief Japanese representative, and the government also hopes that powerful representatives from the private sector will be sent. However, the private sector is indignant that the Indian government has launched a trade war of anti-Japanese tariffs, which cannot be effectively addressed by meetings, so the selection of representatives has not yet been decided. The Japanese government's negotiating policy for the consultation will be to propose (1) the conclusion of a trade treaty or even an agreement with most-favored-nation treatment as its core, (2) the establishment of a reciprocal agreement for the types of transactions as a restriction of most-favored-nation treatment, and (3) when India reduces tariffs on Japanese cotton yarn and cloth, Japan will also prepare to guarantee a certain proportion of the annual import volume of cotton in the spirit of mutual concession, and purchase Indian cotton.

<p>(Tokyo) On the 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following informal statement regarding Anglo-Japanese relations: Japan's diplomatic policy after withdrawing from the League of Nations, as stated in the Imperial Rescript on March 27, is to continue friendly relations with all countries. The Japanese government has no intention of separating from Britain and becoming closer to the United States, but Britain, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, imposes tariffs that prohibit the import of Japanese goods and stops supplying industrial raw materials to Japan. Therefore, Japan must consider appropriate countermeasures for this life-or-death issue. Japan's policy of maintaining friendly relations with all countries will not change, but if Britain does not abandon its current economic policy, Britain will bear a major responsibility for the future disruption of world trade. Japan earnestly hopes that Britain will study effective methods at this juncture to avoid damaging Anglo-Japanese relations. (10th Japan United News Agency Dispatch)</p>

If Chiang thinks it is right, he will announce at the meeting that each unit should follow. Chiang will also instruct them with his own years of combat experience, Communist suppression experience and military experience, which can be regarded as strengths of each area, so as to make a complete bandit suppression military experience program, which is by no means mere theorizing.

In short, after this conference, there will be a renewed emphasis on military and political affairs to prevent the prolongation of the Communist scourge. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Hubei Province is Worrying</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Party Headquarters believes that the provincial government's plan to prevent floods, which the National Economic Commission had proposed, was actually shirking responsibility and was a mistake in embankment construction. It decided to telegram the Central Government and Chiang Kai-shek on the 10th to strongly argue the case. The provincial government also submitted a report to the headquarters, detailing the water situation this year and requesting a change in handling. Director of Construction Li Fanyi went to Jiangxi on the evening of the 10th to pay respects to Chiang Kai-shek and seek instructions. (10th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Urgent Border Situation</h3>
<p>As the ancients said, "Each day the country shrinks by a hundred *li*." But let us observe today. In the one year and nine months since September 18th, has the country not shrunk by five thousand *li* in just a few days? And the frightening reality is not limited to this.</p>
<p>Since Jin Shuren fled Xinjiang, Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai were promoted as members of the provincial government and organized a provisional government. The high officials appointed by the central government have already set out for Xinjiang. The Xinjiang problem may temporarily come to an end, and worries about the west may be slightly reduced. However, upon close examination of the facts, we fear it is not so simple. Although the total population of Xinjiang is only three million, its political relationships are very complex. First, there are international conflicts involved. Xinjiang borders the Soviet Union to the northwest. After the success of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway, the plan for the industrialization of Central Asia will be gradually implemented. Xinjiang's geographical relationship will inevitably become closer to the Soviet Union and further from China. Moreover, the Turkic Muslims of Central Asia and the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang are closely connected, sharing the same religion and language. It is difficult to predict whether their centripetal force towards the motherland will shift. China's desire to completely control Xinjiang is a case of being out of reach. Furthermore, the British Empire's "economic alliance" is striving to unite its overseas colonies. Its policy towards India has become more proactive, and it will not easily relax its grip on southern Xinjiang. The Soviet Union is also incompatible with it. In this situation of competition between two powers, Xinjiang, though vast, exceeding 5,365,000 square *li*, is extremely backward in economic and organizational strength, and has no ability to deal with its strong neighbors. If a conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union were to break out, like the Russo-Japanese War in the Northeast, how would we respond? Second, poor governance is a source of great danger. Since Yang Zengxin and Jin Shuren came to power, not only were government offices chaotic and bribery rampant, but their cruel treatment of the people and disregard for human life surpassed even the tyrannical rulers of ancient times. In recent years, with the westward spread of Western ideas, students returning from studies in the Soviet Union are present in all departments. They left Xinjiang with a purpose and returned to Xinjiang with a plan. The Muslims of Xinjiang have been oppressed, and it is unlikely that they will not rise up in rebellion. Therefore, our country's lack of strategy in controlling Xinjiang lies not in the difference in religious beliefs but in the poorness of political arrangements. If political relations are not improved, we fear that border troubles will deepen and the national situation will become even more unmanageable.</p>
<p>Tibet, which borders Xinjiang to the south, was rumored several months ago to have Tibetan troops invading Sichuan and Kang, and plundering Qinghai. However, nothing more was heard, and there has been no active change. This is because the conflict between the two Lius in Sichuan Province, with its turbulent situation of civil war, is more pressing than the invasion of Tibetan troops. The blood of the Sichuan war has concealed the urgent intelligence from the Tibetan border. Recently, the Dalai Lama has seen that Kangxi is empty of defenses due to the civil war between Liu and Deng. He plans to take the opportunity to enter, intending to cross the Jinsha River and move east, occupying Batang and Litang, to realize his ambition of a "Greater Tibet." Therefore, the warlords in Sichuan Province have been engaged in internal strife for many years, causing strong neighbors to harbor covetous intentions and distant people to have the desire to leave the country. We fear that the 3.8 million square *li* area of ​​Kangxi will inevitably follow the three northeastern provinces and be in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>What is even worse is that the war in eastern Tianjin and along the Great Wall has seemingly come to an end, but the Japanese army has not yet withdrawn, and there are many bandits near Tianjin and Beijing. It is still questionable whether we can safely overcome the difficulties. Furthermore, the Japanese, based on their predetermined policy, can freely advance and retreat in Chahar, which is not clearly stipulated in the truce agreement. Today, the puppet army of Liu Guitang and a part of the Japanese cavalry have attacked Guyuan from Dolon, and they are about to cross Dushikou to control Zhangjiakou. Although Feng Yuxiang has the ambition to resist Japan, he has only tens of thousands of soldiers. Even if he temporarily gathers dilapidated guns and assembles untrained troops, how can he withstand a powerful enemy? Moreover, the land in Chahar is barren, the people are poor, and in recent years, they have suffered from both soldiers and bandits. The financial resources of society have been almost exhausted. It would be difficult to win if they were to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>To sum up the above three points, they are all major concerns of the current Republic of China, and they are deeply connected with Japan. If we fail to actively remedy them, not only will the borders not be secure, but the interior will also be severely affected. The way to save ourselves is to overcome the current contradictions in personnel and, in a short period of time, improve the political organization, so that the interior can be restored to peace and tranquility. Then, we can use military force to consolidate the frontiers, recover lost territories, and strive with the entire national strength to wash away the humiliation in the future.</p>

<p>(London) The World Economic Conference is about to open. According to the information obtained so far, it is sufficient to prove that the conference period will not exceed six weeks. MacDonald and the Secretary-General of the Economic Conference, Avenol (the new Secretary-General of the League of Nations), have already agreed to expedite the conference debates. All speeches and ceremonies will be shortened as much as possible. MacDonald himself plans to complete his speech within fifteen minutes. The Secretariat of the Economic Conference has already drafted the work procedures for the representatives of various countries. This work will not be delayed until after July 15th.

<h3>The United States Notifies That War Debt Is Due</h3>
<p>Debtor Nations' Applications to Modify Payment with U.S. Securities Are Rejected</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States today sent the same note to thirteen debtor nations, notifying them that the current war debt will be due next Thursday and expressing the United States' expectation that debtor nations will pay the full amount, but they may use U.S. securities in lieu of cash. Although the war debt agreement stipulates that changes to the payment method must be notified thirty days in advance, if the debtor nation can accept the method of paying with securities, then that clause can be disregarded. This note was sent after the final talks between the White House, the State Department, and the representatives of the debtor nations. It is reported that the U.S. authorities notified the representatives that the June installments cannot be postponed or reduced, as Congress still opposes postponement or modification, believing that at least until the end of the World Conference, war debts must be paid as before. (9th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that representatives of several debtor nations applied at the last minute to modify the war debt, but the U.S. President told them that he expected the June installments to be paid in full. It is also reported that during informal talks between diplomatic representatives of debtor nations and the White House and the State Department, they pointed out that the unresolved war debt would hinder the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference. The U.S. President replied that war debts have only a slight relationship to the recovery of the world economy, and since the London Conference will not raise the issue of war debts, he does not want to acknowledge war debts as a serious economic problem.

<h3>U.S. Tariff Policy</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Prepares to Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>Advocating for the Conclusion of International Reciprocal Treaties and Negotiations with Various Countries After the Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that although President Roosevelt does not intend to request full power to conclude tariff treaties, he will soon issue a declaration to explain his tariff policy in order to seek understanding from all parties. In that declaration, Roosevelt will advocate for the conclusion of reciprocal international tariff treaties in order to seek a general reduction of tariffs. President Roosevelt hopes that a tariff compromise can be reached at the World Economic Conference, but he is willing to negotiate bilateral treaties after the conference to submit to the next Congress for approval, and he does not want to currently request Congress to grant him the power to increase or decrease tax rates. At the same time, President Roosevelt still has the power to increase or decrease tax rates by 50% based on the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The British Cabinet Convenes to Consider War Debt</h3>
<p>Submitting Practical Suggestions to the United States</p>
<p>Partially Repaying with Silver</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet convened for two hours this afternoon. It is reported that they discussed the war debt issue, but no decision was made. Before the Cabinet meeting, British Prime Minister MacDonald had lunch with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. It is reported that by the end of this week, the British government will inform the U.S. government of its views on the issue of the June war debt payment. It is expected that the British Cabinet will continue to meet next week. It is widely believed that as a result of today's British Cabinet meeting, the British Ambassador to the United States has been ordered to submit practical suggestions to the U.S. government regarding the U.S. debt due on June 15th. Although the content of the suggestions is unknown, political circles believe that this is a form of suggestion that Britain is willing to pay some when negotiations on the entire war debt issue have not yet been concluded, in order to acknowledge the debt. British Cabinet members today definitely want to postpone the payment of this entire debt pending further negotiations, but this section is considered impossible because the U.S. attitude and public opinion do not support postponement. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports, the Cabinet has decided to try to propose to the United States that the British war debt owed to the U.S. due on June 16th be paid first with £2,000,000 in British gold as an indication of Britain's willingness to pay. If President Roosevelt rejects this proposal, then the British government will pay the war debt due on June 15th with silver in accordance with the resolution of the U.S. Congress. In this way, the British government would only have to pay £12,000,000, and would not have to pay the full £19,000,000. According to a Washington dispatch in the Morning Post, the government has 400,000,000 ounces of silver, ready to be sold on the market. The British government may transport this money to Washington. The U.S. delegation attending the World Economic Conference will propose various plans to restore silver prices at the conference, including (1) the restoration of the silver content already reduced in silver coins, (2) the abolition of restrictions on international silver circulation, (3) the arbitrary adoption of silver as part of the gold reserves, and (4) an agreement to regulate the supply of silver in the world market.

<h3>The French Parliament Trusts the Current Government</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Daladier Explains the Policy Towards the Economic Conference, Recognizing That the Redistribution of Gold Is Insufficient to Solve the Currency Crisis, and the Four-Power Pact Eliminates Franco-Italian Divisions</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier said in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies today that the French government has decided to do its best to make the World Economic Conference a success within the possible range. Daladier also defended the Four-Power Pact, saying that this pact is both beneficial to France and contributes to peace. The French Prime Minister then briefly mentioned France's policy at the Economic Conference, saying that the manipulation of gold cannot solve the currency crisis. Countries that abandon the gold standard must first agree on a leveling method. As for the movement to raise prices, France will advocate for a policy of coordinated production among producers from various countries to protect the interests of French farmers. If all major countries comply with the 44-hour workweek, then France can also comply with it. France also supports the process of undertaking public works to remedy unemployment. The French Prime Minister also mentioned the Four-Power Pact, saying that it is very grateful to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for presiding over the negotiations of this pact. This pact is not a tool to dominate others, but only an agreement for mutual cooperation, and the rearmament of Germany is no longer a problem. The two major Latin nations of France and Italy have been divided by misunderstandings, and now these misunderstandings have fortunately been eliminated. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government, in preparation for discussing tariffs at the World Economic Conference, today submitted two bills to the Chamber of Deputies. (1) If a foreign government adopts plans that are unfavorable to French trade, France may impose surtaxes in retaliation. (2) If quotas on goods currently under the import quota system are canceled or modified, France may impose new taxes on them. It was heard tonight that France intends to raise tariffs in retaliation for Germany's suspension of foreign exchange payments. After questioning France's foreign policy, former Prime Minister Herriot proposed a resolution approving the government's policy. This resolution was passed by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 406 to 185. An amendment proposed by a certain member, stipulating that the French government shall not sign any pacts in which the Little Entente, Belgium, and Poland have not participated, was rejected by a vote of 347 to 245.

<h3>Reactions to Germany's Suspension of Foreign Debt Payments</h3>
<p>British Newspapers Express Sympathy, French Newspapers Criticize</p>
<p>(Berlin) The reactions after the announcement of Germany's suspension of debt payments yesterday have proven that countries around the world have understood the reality of Germany's economic position. Now that the World Economic Conference is about to open, such a good reaction is enough to satisfy Germany. Unfortunately, the semi-official Parisian newspaper Le Petit Parisien exclusively held an opposing view, saying that the President of the German National Bank, Schacht, used his cunning means before the opening of the Economic Conference to exert pressure on other countries at the conference venue in the future. The newspaper further stated that Mr. Schacht deliberately paid off the debts of other banks that issue banknotes and exchange bill banks in advance, which was not necessary, and its sole purpose was to reduce the reserves and cash in the National Bank's own treasury to a dangerous state, in order to show that Germany can no longer pay foreign debts. Germany wants to use this strategy to gain sympathy from other countries and concessions on exports and tariffs. Once it obtains concessions, Germany can arbitrarily dump its industrial manufactured goods abroad. Furthermore, the French industrial newspaper retaliated that Schacht's intention is to mix Germany's private interests with the public interests of the Economic Conference, which should be prevented. However, the tone of London newspapers is quite satisfactory. They regard Germany's announcement of the suspension of debt payments as an unavoidable event and do not show any shock.

Ishii also explained to the press the outline of the policy Japan has adopted for the Economic Conference, saying that its main point is to eliminate obstacles to international trade so that it can develop freely.

<h3>Five Proposals from the International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference today passed an important resolution and attached proposals to the World Economic Conference. The delegates had no objections. The resolution was jointly proposed by representatives Chattaji (government side), Warstair (employer side), and Xu He (labor side), advocating (1) restoring the appropriate status of currency, (2) establishing international cooperation to prevent the system of fluctuating prices, (3) stopping economic wars, (4) increasing social purchasing power, and (5) adopting public works policies to restore the circulation of idle capital. U.S. observer Smith stated that the United States supports the resolution. This was the first time a U.S. member has addressed the Labor Office. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference this afternoon agreed by a majority vote on the resolution it intends to submit to the World Economic Conference. Representatives of British and Dutch capital opposed it because the case advocated the holding of public works and the increase of purchasing power. The conference will begin tomorrow to discuss the 40-hour workweek system. Labor delegations do not recognize German representative Lilobo and Italian Lacha as labor representatives and have decided that the two will not be allowed to participate in any committees. French labor representative Juhua took this opportunity to protest the detention of more than 10,000 workers in Germany, and said that he will protest more firmly when the conference opens. The "Recommendations Committee" then accepted the request of the labor representatives of Germany and Italy and allowed them to participate. Therefore, the labor delegations retreated on their own, but French representative Juhua, in the name of the labor delegations, specifically stated that he did not recognize Lilobo and Lacha as agents of the delegations.

Mr. Gong flew to Xun on the 10th and will return to Beijing in the next few days after reporting to Chairman Chiang. Cao stayed in Beijing to report to the Central Government. In addition, a certain agency received a telegram from abroad on the 10th, stating that Ma Zhongying's troops continued to advance from Guchengzi to Sheng Shicai's troops. Sheng's troops withdrew to Dihua Provincial City on the 9th. According to Cao, when Gong left Dihua on the 7th, the two troops of Ma and Sheng were still 300 *li* apart, and Sheng's troops were also 100 *li* away from the provincial city. Moreover, representatives from the provincial side arrived in Guchengzi and invited representatives of Ma's troops to arrive in Dihua on the 9th. The claim that the war had broken out again and that Sheng's troops had retreated to defend the city is doubtful. On the 8th, we met with Envoy Huang in Lanzhou. Huang flew from Lan to Suzhou on the 9th, and from Suzhou to Dihua on the 10th, and can arrive on the same day. After Huang arrives in the province, the incident is expected to be quelled.

(10th Special Dispatch) Over 70 Die in U.S. Heatwave, Wheat Losses Reach Millions (National News Agency, Chicago, 9th) The midwestern states of the United States have been experiencing a heatwave for nearly a week, and the intense heat continues today. More than seventy people have drowned while trying to escape the heat. It is estimated that the wheat harvest has suffered losses of millions of dollars, as much of the half-ripe wheat in many areas has withered and cannot grow any further. The climate at the Chicago Exposition, located on the shore of Lake Michigan, is relatively pleasant, and the number of visitors has increased. (Havas, New York, 9th) The heat in the United States has caused twenty-three deaths in Illinois. In Philadelphia, 300,000 students from various elementary schools were dismissed and sent home due to the heat. (Havas, Washington, 9th) The Department of Agriculture announced that this year's hot weather and prolonged drought have resulted in a wheat harvest of only 603,000,000 bushels, which is insufficient for domestic use. This is the first time this has happened since the 20th century. (National News Agency, Washington, 9th) Resistance to the President's ideas in the U.S. Senate has suddenly disappeared today, and several important bills have been quickly passed. The rest are expected to be passed tomorrow. According to senators, the extreme heat has been a major factor in creating a compromise. Senators are eager to escape the oppressive heat of Washington and return home or go to cooler places, so even the most stubborn senators have softened their stance. The Senate passed two stringent amendments to the National Industrial Recovery Act yesterday and passed the entire bill by a vote of 57 to 24 today. Shortly thereafter, it passed the government's railroad relief and tax bills. The Philippine Independence Issue (National News Agency, Washington, 9th) Following the news that Philippine political leaders will meet next week to discuss whether to accept the independence proposal, the government is reportedly quite concerned about the situation in the Philippines. Regardless of the decision made in Manila, the U.S. government will still face a Philippine problem. If the independence proposal is accepted, some European countries, especially Germany, are expected to try to seize the island's trade and may begin efforts to conclude an exclusive treaty with the Philippines before independence is implemented. If the Filipinos reject the proposal, they will come to Washington again to launch another independence movement, hoping for a more favorable resolution. However, a survey of congressional attitudes today shows very little support for the proposal. Nevertheless, the Philippine representatives have the right to force both houses to submit a new proposal. Regarding the dispute over American investment, the Department of Commerce will announce today that American investment in the island is very small. Besides the $105,000,000 invested by Americans residing on the island, Americans have invested only $150,000,000. France Explains the Four-Power Pact to Poland (National News Agency, Warsaw, 10th) The French Ambassador to Warsaw today called on Polish Foreign Minister Beck and presented a note from the French government explaining various points of the Four-Power Pact. The note is identical to the one sent by the French government to the Little Entente countries and emphasizes France's views on Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. New Spanish Cabinet (National News Agency, Madrid, 10th) President Zamora consulted with leading figures many times last night but failed to achieve results. He finally entrusted the Socialist leader Fernando de los Ríos with forming a new cabinet. Ríos initially declined, but after repeated requests from the President, he agreed to consider the matter and will give a definite answer at noon today. It is believed that Ríos will form a mixed cabinet of Socialists and Republicans, but new elections are likely to be held soon. Matsuoka and Adachi Form a Party, Truce Within the Seiyukai (China United Press, Tokyo, 10th) Since Kenkichi Adachi of the National League broke away from the Minseito Party and established his own faction, he has been making great efforts to get close to the military and advocate fascism. This time, taking advantage of the internal strife within the Seiyukai, he secretly sent a leader to contact the anti-Suzuki faction. It is rumored that Yosuke Matsuoka, the "mouthpiece" of the military, has also been in close contact with Adachi and is secretly plotting to form a new political party in order to take over the next government under the patronage of the military. Kunizo Kuhara of the Seiyukai recently advocated one country, one party, which is solid proof of internal coordination with the Adachi faction. The radicals within the Seiyukai, upon receiving this news, were greatly alarmed and suddenly changed their attitude, proposing a truce to the self-respect faction, fearing that internal strife would lead to a party split and ultimately contribute to the new party movement of Adachi and Matsuoka. However, Matsuoka's secretary issued a statement today denying any involvement in the new party movement. (China United Press, Tokyo, 10th) The Seiyukai held another meeting last night to assess the domestic situation and concluded that it was unfavorable for a no-confidence motion. If a no-confidence motion is actively pursued, there is a risk that the party will split before the cabinet is overthrown, which would be detrimental. Therefore, it was decided to propose two conditions for reconciliation with the self-respect faction: (1) From today onwards, both sides will cease all opposing activities and stop holding meetings. (2) The president will have unconditional authority over the strategy towards the government. If the self-respect faction accepts this proposal, the internal strife within the Seiyukai may come to an end. Sano and Others Leave the Communist Party (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th) A report states that Sano, the leader of the 185 communist party members currently on trial, and another person jointly issued a statement announcing their withdrawal from communism and adherence to radical nationalism. This move has dealt a significant blow to the Japanese communist movement. Mass Arrests of Suspected Assassins in Greece (Reuters, Athens, 9th) Several members of the Athens detective squad are suspected of involvement in the assassination attempt on veteran politician Venizelos on June 7th and were arrested yesterday. The opposition party was quite shaken by this. The Greek government has now adopted strict measures to maintain order. Prime Minister Tsaldaris today ordered that anyone involved in this case, regardless of their position, must be arrested and punished. Mattern Flies Over Irkutsk (TASS, Moscow, 10th) Mattern departed from Boroaia at 1:50 this morning and flew over Irkutsk at 2:30. (TASS, Moscow, 10th) Mattern, who is continuing his trans-Siberian flight, will leave Boroaia for Khabarovsk today. He landed in Boroaia at 3:45 p.m. yesterday (Moscow time) and spent three hours and fifty minutes flying from Krasnoyarsk to Boroaia. Before leaving Krasnoyarsk, he wrote to a local newspaper, praising the assistance he received during his flight over Russia. He said that the head of the Novosibirsk airport made a special trip to Boroaia to repair his aircraft. The repair work was very effective and quick. In conclusion, he wished the Soviet people well and hoped that he would return home soon. (National News Agency, Moscow, 9th) American aviator Mattern has apparently decided not to go to Chita and will fly directly from near Irkutsk to Boli. The Russian authorities have allowed him to take a more direct flight path. After his plane was repaired in Krasnoyarsk, it arrived at Pelloaette near Irkutsk at 4:45 p.m. today. After resting for a few hours, he will follow the great circle route across the earth, heading to Nome, Alaska, via Boli. Opening of the Chinese Pavilion at the Chicago Exposition (Havas, Chicago, 9th) The Chinese Pavilion at the "Century of Progress" exposition has recently opened. The official opening ceremony is scheduled to take place later in the presence of Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States. The Chinese Pavilion is a Chinese-style building with a garden in front. Chen Mingshu Goes to Hong Kong, Party Affairs Disputes Remain Unresolved. (Fuzhou Correspondence) Chen Mingshu, who claimed to have come to Fujian to escape the summer heat and study, suddenly took the Hai Ning steamer to Hong Kong on the 4th of this month with Jiang Guangnai, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government. According to official news, Chen's trip is to treat a foot ailment, but it is difficult to predict whether he will return. Jiang will return to his hometown to take care of family affairs (one account says it is for his son's wedding) and will return to the province in two weeks. Provincial government affairs are being handled by Secretary-General Li Zhangda. Dai Ji, who came to Fujian from Shanghai a few days ago, is still residing in the Wooden Gate Outside the Third Bridge Club. It is said that the 19th Route Army will give him an important position to assist in suppressing bandits in Fujian. The atmosphere in Fujian has been most tense since Jiang and Cai issued a telegram last month. After the Central Government's reply explaining the situation, the situation has gradually eased and is now as peaceful as usual. The reorganization dispute of the Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee has been deadlocked for several months and is still difficult to resolve. The current guidance committee has approved the request of various county party headquarters to convene the first provincial representative conference on August 1st to elect executive and supervisory committee members and establish a formal provincial party headquarters. The newly appointed guidance committee members, led by Chen Lesan, Chen Lianfen, Wu Shikun, and Cai Zhendong, led dozens of people armed with handguns in five cars and broke into the provincial party headquarters, surrounding the office building and attempting to forcibly take over the office. The situation was extremely turbulent and the order was greatly disrupted. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau was notified and immediately dispatched more than 100 security guards to suppress the situation, arresting Zheng Bingyan, Weng Liwei, Zeng Tianyi, and 23 others, and handing them over to the Pacification Headquarters for interrogation. At 3:00 p.m., another team was dispatched to the agency of the new guidance committee at Fahaishi Temple and seized secret telegrams and many important documents. The Provincial Party Guidance Committee has telegraphed the Central Government about the situation and requested instructions. (7th)</h3>

<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Invade Chahar in Multiple Routes, Traitorous Troops Serve as Puppets, Japanese Troops Follow Closely Behind, Feng, Fang, and Sun's Troops Actively Deploy Defenses (8th, Special Dispatch from Beiping) After the Japanese army threatened Tianjin and Beiping due to international relations and forced us into a treaty under duress, the war within the Great Wall has temporarily come to an end. They are now focusing their full attention on Chahar in order to complete their so-called Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Various conspiracies have already been revealed to the readers. Indeed, since the establishment of the North China Armistice Agreement, the war within the Great Wall had just ended when the situation in eastern Chahar became tense. Japanese and puppet troops have been dispatched one after another for a large-scale invasion of Chahar. The Japanese army had previously instigated the rebel forces of Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu to occupy Dolon, but the troops had not yet advanced further. There were approximately two reasons for this: First, the war within the Great Wall was in full swing, and there was no time to look westward. Second, transportation from Rehe to Chahar was inconvenient, making transportation difficult. It was necessary to make full preparations before launching a distant expedition. Due to these two reasons, they focused on the main force within the Great Wall to expedite the war, while using Dolon and Fengning in western Rehe as bases for invading Chahar, stockpiling grass and storing food as necessary preparations for war. Recently, with the end of the war within the Great Wall and the achievement of their desired objectives, preparations for invading Chahar have also been largely completed. In addition to stockpiling large quantities of military supplies in Dolon and Fengning, they have also built airfields and stationed many aircraft to strengthen their air force for the invasion of Chahar. As for their combat plan, it is purely based on the strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese. In addition to the rebel forces of Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu, who have willingly accepted their command, they have also incited Tang Yulin to join the rebellion through Zhang Haipeng. The Japanese army is using these rebel forces as puppets, allowing them to advance as the vanguard, while they remain in a supervisory position, advancing step by step to reap the benefits without any effort. They have now entered Chahar in two routes. One route is led by the rebel forces of Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu, advancing westward along the Zhang-Dolon Road. The other route is led by Zhang Haipeng and Tang Yulin, leading the rebel forces southward from south of Guyuan. In addition to dispatching military officers to directly supervise and command the rebel forces, the majority of the Japanese army is concentrated in the Dolon-Guyuan area. The headquarters of the Mogi Cavalry Brigade is currently located in Dolon, commanding all operations. With Tang Yulin's surrender to the Japanese in Guyuan, the gateway to eastern Chahar was lost without a fight. The rebel forces of Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu began moving from Dolon at the beginning of the month, capturing Baochang on the 4th and entering Kangbao on the 6th. The volunteer forces of Feng Zhanhai and Li Zhongyi were in the process of moving, leaving the defenses empty, allowing Liu and others to enter unchecked. Zhang Haipeng and Tang Yulin are planning the invasion of Chahar with Mogi, the commander of the Japanese cavalry brigade, in Pindingbao, northeast of Guyuan. Their troops are stationed in Guyuan and the area to the south. In recent days, they have also begun to show signs of activity. After Liu and others invaded Baochang and Kangbao, they continued to advance westward. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet troops from all routes will also launch large-scale operations. The situation in Chahar is indeed as precarious as a pile of eggs. Feng Yuxiang has now ordered Zhang Lisheng, Nie Yuling, and others to lead their troops in the Zhangbei area to strictly defend against the enemy. Defenses have also been set up near Zhangjiakou, with Ji Hongchang and others leading troops to defend against the enemy. Fang Zhenwu's Zhang Renjie Division has opened up Dushikou, holding the strategic pass. Sun Dianying's troops are also on standby in the Chicheng-Shacheng area. Currently, Feng and Fang's troops have established joint defenses from Dushikou to Zhangbei. The junction of Rehe and Chahar, south of Dushikou, is entirely defended by Sun Dianying's troops. On the Ping-Sui Road, from Kangzhuang to Zhangjiakou, Feng, Fang, and Sun's troops are responsible for different sections. The defense line is more organized than before. If the Japanese and puppet troops advance further, fierce battles will occur. Since the situation in Chahar became critical, the Beiping military authorities have also dispatched Guan's division to the Nankou-Juyongguan area to strengthen defenses in case of emergencies. In recent days, trenches have been dug in the Qinglongqiao area, and artillery has been erected on the mountains of Juyongguan. (7th, Special Dispatch from Beiping) Since the establishment of the North China Armistice Agreement, the Japanese army has shifted its focus to Chahar, increasing troops and vigilance in western Rehe and instigating the rebel forces of Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu to actively invade westward. The number of Japanese troops in Dolon, Fengning, and other places has increased by one-third, and military supplies are being transported from Chengde one after another. After Liu Guitang's rebel forces invaded Guyuan from Dolon, they continued to advance westward and entered the Baochang-Kangbao area yesterday (the 6th). The situation is tense. The telegraph and telephone lines between Zhangbei and Zhangjiakou were also temporarily disrupted yesterday for unknown reasons. The Kangbao area was originally defended by Feng Zhanhai's troops, who have now led their troops south, resulting in no troops stationed between Guyuan and Kangbao, allowing Liu's rebels to enter unchecked. On the Dushikou front, after Fang Zhenwu's anti-Japanese army arrived, a Japanese aircraft came to scout and dropped bombs, killing and wounding more than 20 soldiers and civilians. A unit of Liu's rebels invaded Fang's defense area on the 5th, coming into contact with Zhao Guangming's division of Fang's troops and being repelled. More than 200 rifles, 3 machine guns, 2 cars, and 2 radio stations were seized, and more than 100 officers and soldiers were captured. Yesterday (the 7th), Feng Zhanhai's southward moving troops arrived in the Huaian area north of Xuanhua, encountering Bao Gang's anti-Japanese army from Fang's troops. A conflict occurred, and 500-600 troops from Feng's troops were disarmed by Bao's army. There was still contact in that area today (the 7th). Li Fuying's division of the Shanxi army, originally stationed in Zhangjiakou, has now been entirely relocated to Chaigoubu. Zhangjiakou is entirely guarded by Feng Yuxiang's anti-Japanese army. Zhangbei was originally defended by Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry division of the Shanxi army. Recently, due to Feng's Zhang Lisheng and others recruiting and reorganizing old troops and local militias there, they have also gradually moved westward to establish joint defenses with Li Fuying's troops. Since taking office, Feng has actively expanded his military strength. In addition to increasing and reorganizing the guard troops, he has also dispatched Zhang Lisheng, Ji Hongchang, Nie Yuling, Zhang Ziguang, and others to recruit old troops and train local militias. He has now gathered 50,000-60,000 troops. In terms of politics, he emphasizes political organization. In recent years, he has recruited young people and organized the Peasant and Labor Party, seeking a new path in politics. Feng himself also occasionally reveals his intention to be non-partisan. Feng had a lot of contact with the Southwest and other parties before taking office. After taking office, he also dispatched representatives everywhere to communicate. The Japanese army is paying close attention to Feng, stating that if Feng does not ally with Russia to invade Japan, the Japanese army will not attack him for the time being. However, in recent days, the Japanese army has increased its presence in western Rehe, showing signs of actively invading Chahar, and has dispatched Liu Guitang and other rebel forces to engage in harassment. The Central Government and the Beiping Military Branch are paying close attention to the Chahar issue and are finding it extremely difficult to handle due to the complexity of the relations. It has been internally decided to have Sun in charge of Chahar and to transfer Fu Zuoyi's troops back to Chahar as a way of addressing the problem at its root. Whether this can be done smoothly remains to be seen. Yan Xishan sent a telegram yesterday urging Bo Zuoyi to return to Taiyuan for consultation. Fu plans to return to Taiyuan in the next few days. Xu Yongchang arrived in Beiping this morning in response to a telegram from He and Huang. According to talks, Yan did not express any views on Feng's actions. If it is beneficial to the country, he will support it. If it is not beneficial to the country, he should oppose it. Yan is known for his deep and calm demeanor, and his attitude is elusive. At present, the Japanese army in Chahar is watching with predatory eyes, and the domestic relations are so complex. It is truly unimaginable what the future holds. Villages in Tongzhou Again Sacked. (Special Dispatch from Beiping) Japanese aircraft flew over Beiping this morning (8th) three times for reconnaissance. Japanese aircraft were also spotted flying very low over Nanyuan, their purpose still being reconnaissance. In the villages near Fancun in the Yanjiao Township of Tongzhou this morning (8th), 400-500 puppet troops were suddenly discovered. The army also had a certain foreigner directing everything. After our army had withdrawn, they carried out a large-scale burning and looting, and dug trenches and erected machine guns outside each village to build defensive works, intending to stay for a long time. After the civilian houses were occupied, holes were drilled in the walls to set up guns and cannons. Women, children, and the elderly all fled into Tongzhou city for refuge, numbering about a thousand people. The Japanese troops along the Grand Canal and in Yanjiao Township have not moved much. Only the artillery has been withdrawn. The situation along the Lutai area east of the Beining Line has not changed much either. The puppet troops are carrying out large-scale harassment on both sides of the Luan River. The stations of Kaiping, Guye, Leizhuang, etc., are all being ravaged. The Leizhuang station master appointed by the puppet Fengshan Railway was also killed by the puppet troops, who also declared that they would carry out a large-scale looting of Tangshan. The area is also very panicked. The Japanese still want to place the puppet troops under Japanese control. Li Jichun, with his image as a Japanese collaborator, will find it difficult to change his ways for the time being. At the same time, the Japanese side is also interested in restoring traffic on the Beining Railway. Although we previously negotiated with the Japanese through Qian Zongze to restore through traffic on the Ping-Yu Line, the issue of the puppet troops is a major obstacle in practice. The Japanese side still hopes to keep the puppet troops in the non-militarized zone of eastern Luan as a maximum concession. If this cannot be achieved, at the very least, they will be stationed on the border of Rehe in preparation for any eventuality. Our side cannot rashly agree to Li Jichun's request for asylum. After the security team is established, a combination of suppression and appeasement will be the only solution. (8th) Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Military Conference to Suppress Bandits, Detailed Resolutions on Military Plans (Nanchang Correspondence) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a military conference to suppress bandits at the Nanchang headquarters yesterday. Because it is a tense period for suppressing bandits, the chief commanders, division commanders, and army commanders must all be responsible for their original defenses. Most were represented by deputy division commanders, chiefs of staff, or chiefs of staff. The 16th Army Commander Li Yunheng, 27th Army Commander Li Yunjie, 22nd Army Chief of Staff Li Jiabai, 1st Army Councilor Liu Weicheng, 8th Division Deputy Division Commander Xiang Chaozhong, 26th Division Huang Yuqing, 28th Division Dong Jian, 5th Division Yao Chun, 16th Division Guo Chiping, 40th Division Cheng Guangyao, 62nd Division Zhang Jingwan, 19th Division Chief of Staff Huang Suzhen, 15th Division Chen Zhaoda, 63rd Division Li Zhongren, 6th Division Zhou Pengshang, 18th Division Huang Zhong, 82nd Division Wang Hanmin, 46th Division Dai Sixia, Provisional 3rd Brigade Sun Lieifu, 21st Division Han Dong, and Nanchang Garrison Commander Lai Weiying, totaling about 70 people, have reported for duty. More officers from various army and division headquarters are expected to arrive today (9th). The conference first established a secretariat, which received hundreds of proposals, which were divided into categories and included in the agenda. The conference is scheduled to last three days, with six meetings planned. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 a.m. on the 8th in the Grand Auditorium of the Baihuazhou Headquarters. The members who reported, as well as the directors of the headquarters' various departments, He Guoguang, Xiong Shihui, Yan Xunfu, Liu Xing, and Zhu Huaibing, attended. Chairman Chiang presided over the meeting. After the meeting began, Chiang delivered a training speech, hoping that all departments would not avoid difficulties and dangers during this period of national crisis, unite as one, eliminate the communist bandits, and secure the country from within and resist foreign aggression. Then, the officers of the 37th Division and the 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Divisions reported on the situation of the bandits in eastern Jiangxi and the progress of suppressing them. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The second meeting continued from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., still chaired by Chiang, who discussed the military plan for encircling and suppressing the communist bandits. A detailed plan was made. Important resolutions will be issued by the headquarters to various departments for implementation. (9th) Xu's Bandits Continue to Occupy Bazhong, Tian and Liu's Armies Retreat, Tongjiang and Wanyuan Under Martial Law, Xu Yuanquan Goes to Enshi to Eliminate the He Bandits Within a Limited Time, Headquarters Again Orders All Armies to Strictly Blockade the Bandit Areas (Hankou Correspondence) The chaos in Sichuan has been going on for a month now. The banks of the Pi River are still shrouded in the clouds of war. However, the remnants of Xu's bandits have raised their banners and come with open arms. After the fall of Nanjiang, the bandits drove straight in and reached Bazhong on the 3rd. The defending general was Zeng Nanfu, a division commander of Tian Songyao's army. He was unsuccessful in his defense and retreated to the Enyang River that night. The next day, the bandits occupied Bazhong. The left wing of Tian's army, Liu Hanxiong's unit, also retreated to the Changchi-Lianghekou line to await reinforcements and launch a counterattack. After the bandits captured Bazhong, they divided their forces and launched an eastward raid. Tongjiang and Wanyuan were alerted at the same time. Tongjiang is also defended by Tian's army, but its strength is weak and insufficient to resist the bandits. The Wanyuan garrison, led by Liu Cunhou, is also said to have been defeated and retreated to Maduguan. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to defend both cities for long. While attacking Tongjiang and Wanyuan, the bandits sent plainclothes teams south to disrupt central Sichuan. Signs of bandits have been found in the Nanchong area. Their goal is to communize all of Sichuan, not just to occupy Nanjiang, Bazhong, Tongjiang, and Wanyuan. The He bandits entrenched in western Hubei and the Xu bandits are birds of a feather. They have long thought of breaking through and joining forces. Eastern Sichuan is where Liu Xiang's forces are stationed, and his strength is strong. They have not dared to try lightly. Recently, it was heard that Xu's bandits had been successful in northern Sichuan and were eager to move. Xu Yuanquan, the chief commander for suppressing bandits in western Hubei, departed from Shashi for Yichang on the 9th and transferred to Enshi to supervise the suppression. Xu's chief of staff, Yang Shaodong, telegraphed from Shashi to Hankou on the same day, saying that Xu had a detailed plan for suppressing the He bandits. Jiang Zuojun, Zhang Gang, Xu Jiwu, and Pan Shanzhai, and other generals, have rushed to the front to deploy and will launch an attack within a limited time. The bandit-occupied areas are all in high mountains and inconvenient to access. However, thorough planning has been done, and the transportation of supplies will not be difficult. It has been set to completely eliminate the communist bandits in western Hubei within a month. As for the position of the newly appointed chief commander for suppressing bandits in the Hunan-Hubei region, the appointment certificate and seal will be issued before he takes office. Xu is using elite troops and planning before fighting. It is expected that after launching an attack, he will be able to greatly frustrate the bandits' momentum. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that it is necessary to blockade the bandit areas and cut off their supplies while launching a large-scale suppression of bandits. The previous lax blockade was the result of inertia and mistakes. He has reissued measures for blockading the bandit areas from the Nanchang Headquarters. The Hankou Headquarters forwarded the order to all armies on the 9th, requiring them to strictly comply. The original order is as follows: "In order to enforce compliance, it is hereby ordered that the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Committee has issued an instruction stating that although the communist bandits have been suppressed repeatedly since the communist rebellion, they have not been eliminated. The reason is that the traffic and material blockade has not been strict, which has been the greatest impact on military affairs. Now, during the period of large-scale suppression, strict blockade should be enforced, and no delays should be tolerated, lest the bandit disaster be prolonged. Therefore, these headquarters have reissued measures for blockading the bandit areas and are issuing them accordingly. It is ordered that the chief commander forward them to all subordinate troops and supervise and urge all local governments to strictly implement them to achieve practical results and report the handling of the matter at any time." (9th) The Situation in Sichuan is in Chaos, Although Mediation Efforts are Very Active, Liu and Deng's Sides Still Do Not Regret Causing Trouble (Chongqing Correspondence) The 24th and 28th Armies have been facing each other in the Pi River area of western Sichuan for nearly two weeks. In recent days, the war on the front line has entered a state of standstill, and the mobilization of troops by both sides has gradually slackened, but it has not completely stopped. Since the opening of the Lezhi Conference and Deng Xihou's attendance, there have been widespread rumors that major changes will occur in the Sichuan situation. The result of the Lezhi Conference is that all armies advocated peace and the use of political means to resolve the dispute between Deng and Liu. The 24th Army originally planned to make a final offensive, trying its best to cross the Pi River and completely resolve the 28th Army. However, after several major battles, the army was exhausted, and it was difficult to determine whether it could win with certainty. If all parties were drawn into the vortex due to the prolonged war, it would be more difficult for the army to cope in an isolated environment. Therefore, Liu Wenhui's attitude has also gradually softened, and mediation efforts in Chengdu have become more active. However, there is still no sign of a resolution. A few days ago, representatives from the 23rd Army, Liu Zhaogan, the 29th Army, Tang Wanyu and Hu Kaiying, the 28th Army, Niu Fanjiu, the 24th Army, Bai Yuren and Wu Jingbo, and Zhang Yihong, Zeng Ziyu, Wang Zisai, Xiao Jingxuan, and the 20th Army, Qiao Zhongquan, held a Sichuan peace conference in the Chengdu Municipal Government. As a result of the conference, a mediation committee was organized, and a telegram was sent to Mianyang to welcome Sun Decao, the deputy commander of the 29th Army, to come to the province to preside over the meeting. Sun has not yet arrived in the province. Liu Zhaogan and others have been very busy with the peace talks in recent days, and many Baoding-affiliated generals in the 24th, 28th, 29th, and 3rd Armies have risen up to support this meeting. Because the 24th Army began to use force against Deng a few days ago, thinking that it could resolve Deng's troops within a week, but unexpectedly, Deng's troops became more united under pressure, resulting in the war dragging on to this day. As for the unfortunate expansion of the war, it is extremely unfavorable for the 24th Army, and the 28th Army may not be able to obtain any benefits. The snipe and clam fight, and the third party benefits. The Baoding-affiliated generals, seeing this, are afraid that it will be more difficult to gain a foothold in Sichuan in the future. So, the old tune of re-unity is again noisily played. Liu Wenhui is also quite aware of this and has expressed his willingness to order a ceasefire and wait for mediation from all parties. Liu Wenhui had previously insisted that there would be no room for mediation unless Deng Xihou stepped down and handed over his troops. Later, he made the removal of Huang Yimin from his position a condition for the ceasefire. Recently, mediators have advocated that both parties first cease military action, and then the 24th Army withdraw from Wenjiang, Pixian, Chongning, and the original agencies of the 28th Army in the provincial capital be restored to their original situation. If this is the case, the 24th Army will feel embarrassed, but Liu Wenhui has expressed that he has no preconceived notions. Niu Fanjiu and Zhu Jiangqing have repeatedly telegraphed Deng Xihou from the province to seek Deng's opinion, but Deng has not responded. Therefore, there is no sign of mediation. Rao Chetao, the commander of the 16th Mixed Brigade of the 28th Army, is a classmate of Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou. During this battle, Rao's troops remained inactive and did not participate on either side. Liu Wenhui consulted with him several times, and Rao volunteered to mediate the war between the 24th and 28th Armies and promote the reunification of the Baoding clique to create a new position in the Sichuan situation to cope with the current environment. Deng's Army Launches a Large-Scale Counterattack. As for Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, he has not responded to the peace talks because Deng holds a deep-seated grudge against Liu Wenhui, saying that he would rather be defeated and determined to break the cauldron, unwilling to reconcile with Liu. Deng's original combat plan was to retreat to the east of the Pi River, hold on to the death, and wait for support from all parties. At the same time, he sent representatives to contact all parties, and all parties sympathized with Deng because Liu dared to risk the world to disrupt the peace and disapproved of Liu's actions. Deng once gave a speech to the soldiers of the army, saying that there would be a solution after three weeks of holding on to the death. The officers and soldiers of the unit were also united in the face of life and death and fought hard. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, the 28th Army has been able to maintain its original line to defend against the enemy's attack and has won several victories, making the enemy dare not underestimate it. At the Lezhi Conference a few days ago, Deng Xihou met with Li Jiayu, and the relationship between the two sides was greatly restored. Li was originally a general of the 28th Army, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan Border Defense, with three divisions directly under his command, and was personally promoted by Deng. Later, due to Liu Wenhui's discord, he broke away from Deng. For the past three years, Li Jiayu has been at a loss, and even if he depends on Liu Xiang, there is no solution. Therefore, there is a proposal to make up for the broken mirror. Li was reappointed as the deputy commander of the 28th Army, and his troops have advanced from Zizhong and Lezhi, and have officially contacted Wang Yuanhu's troops of the 24th Army. The war in western Sichuan is gradually becoming silent, and the war situation in the central route has been completely divided. The special forces of the 24th Army, since the beginning of the war, have been fully equipped on the Pi River lines, concentrating on bombing. In recent days, most of them have been transferred back to Chengdu and distributed to the southern and eastern parts of Sichuan. The original</p>

<p>Tax Evasion and Fine for Cigarettes: Ningbo Native Qian Weixin</p>
<p>Qian Weixin, a 49-year-old Ningbo native, recently established Xinhuan Tobacco Co., Ltd. with Cai Aqi and Cai Fusheng in the west厢房 at No. 16, Shengping Lane, Avenue Edward VII. The distribution location was at No. 17, Ladu Lane, Ladu Fang. They set up a cigarette-making machine to privately manufacture counterfeit cigarettes of the "Great Fairy," "China South," and "British" brands. They sent people around to sell them, making a lot of profit. This was discovered by Wu Yaou, a western detective from the cigarette tax evasion office of the French Concession police. The detective, along with detectives Zhou Baosheng, Zhu Qiming, Zhao Chengen, and Zhou Yanfen, rushed to the distribution location in Shengping Lane at 11:00 a.m. the day before. They seized 40,500 counterfeit "Fairy" brand cigarettes, 5,500 "China South" brand cigarettes, and 500 "British" brand cigarettes. Qian Weixin was arrested on the spot, while Cai and others fled upon hearing the news. They then went to the machine site at No. 17 Ladu Lane and confiscated 9,000 "Fairy" brand cigarettes, tobacco leaves, tobacco shreds, more than ten hand-cranked machines, a tobacco cutting machine, trademark paper, and other items. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for investigation. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case and said that the defendant had violated the tax evasion regulations and requested an investigation. Then, Cheng Renjun, a representative of the British American Tobacco Company, and Li Pengcheng, a lawyer representing the China South Tobacco Company, both stated that the defendant had counterfeited their companies' cigarettes, which constituted a crime of trademark infringement and requested a joint investigation. The judge said that the police only prosecuted for violations. As for trademark infringement, they should request the police to file a separate public prosecution. Lawyer Li and others retreated upon hearing this instruction and immediately filed a request with the police to initiate a public prosecution. The court then interrogated the defendant. According to Qian's statement, the company was entirely run by the two fugitives, Cai Aqi and Cai Fusheng. He only contributed 100 yuan and was only responsible for managing finances and knew nothing about the counterfeiting. The rest of his供词 was evasive. Judge Zhang Chaoyou核供 and sentenced Qian Weixin in court for tax evasion, fined 300 yuan, and confiscated the seized cigarettes.</p>
<p>Teacher Gets Feces Dumped on Head; Hu Shufang Accuses Xu Haoran of Retaliation for Failed Graft</p>
<p>At Shenxin Elementary School, founded by Shenxin Yarn Factory at No. 16 Shenxin Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, Huxi, recently, a teacher accused another, resulting in a retaliatory act involving bribing hooligans to throw feces. The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>Hu Shufang, a 53-year-old teacher from Changzhou, went to the Second Substation of the Sixth District with witnesses Tan Zhongliang, Qian Shoukang, Qian Yinshuo, and Zhang Jianhua to accuse Xu Haoran, a teacher at the same school. He claimed that Xu had bribed hooligans Yang Dequan (nicknamed "White Eyes"), Fu Chun Da, and Yang Yinggen to throw feces on his head on the night of the 1st of this month in retaliation for a failed attempt at embezzlement. Yang and others fled immediately, causing him to be covered in feces and unjustly insulted. He pleaded for an investigation.</p>
<p>Officer Wei, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the police to summon the defendant Xu, Yang, and the apprentice Wang Yishou. They were transferred to the Sixth District Police Station. The district chief questioned them separately.</p>
<p>According to the plaintiff, Hu Shufang, a 53-year-old Changzhou native, has been a teacher at Shenxin Elementary School for nine years. On the night of the 1st of this month, he was invited by Xu Haoran (the defendant) to Xu's residence (Xu's Ruifeng Rice Store in the town) for dinner. After dinner, at about 10 p.m., he returned to school with teachers Qian Shoukang, Qian Yinshuo, and friend Zhang Jianhua. When they reached the bridgehead of Gujia Lane, a dark place, three or four men suddenly jumped out from the roadside and poured a bucket full of feces on his head, causing him to be covered in filth. He was shocked and晕昏. The men, seeing their goal achieved, fled. Fortunately, Qian, Zhang, and others saw the light of a food stall and caught a glimpse of one of the men, "White Eyes" (Yang Dequan). They were unable to pursue them at the time and had to return to school to change clothes. However, Qian and Zhang were also slightly splattered with filth. Later, although he knew it was done by Yang, he did not dare to accuse them without catching them. While he was investigating, he suddenly received a report from the school's tea boy, Tan Zhongliang, stating that he had overheard Wang Yishou, an apprentice at Xu's Ruifeng Rice Store, say in front of the store that Xu Haoran had paid six yuan to "White Eyes," Chuan Chunliu, and Yang Yinggen to throw feces on Hu先生, to let him尝尝木穉佳味, and laughed and clapped his hands. Upon hearing this, he was indignant and knew that it was Xu who had bribed them, which was proven to be true. He and Xu were colleagues and had been together for eight years without any feud. He believed that Xu wanted to insult him because Xu had recently tried to embezzle about 1,000 yuan in the school but was discovered and investigated by the authorities. He was unable to conceal it for him, so Xu held a grudge and sought revenge, resulting in this despicable prank. Now that it was proven, he was innocent and had suffered this insult. He asked for severe punishment.</p>
<p>The testimonies of the witnesses, Tan Zhongliang, Qian Shoukang, Qian Yinshuo, and Zhang Jianhua, were the same as the plaintiff's. The defendants, Xu Haoran, Wang Yishou, Yang Dequan, Bo Chun Da, and Yang Yinggen, all denied it and were evasive. After receiving the供词, the district chief, considering that the case involved指控挟嫁汚辱, ordered them to await interrogation by the局.</p>
<p>Chen Xianggen Accused of Neglecting Business; Carpenter Electrocuted to Death</p>
<p>After the 神仙世界 closed down, its buildings were taken over by Shibao, with the fourth floor being used by the Shibao for its own purposes. The remaining rooms were rented to Ju, the owner of Minghechun Wanton Restaurant, who hired workers to extensively repair and decorate them. Because the lights had not yet been installed, Chen Xianggen, the owner of Chen Xiangji Electric Company at No. 5, Lane 1310, Avenue Edward VII, was entrusted to install temporary lights. The current was connected from Shibao. However, the wires used by Chen were old wires left over from the 神仙世界, and the rubber insulation had peeled off, causing the current to leak out. Touching it could be fatal. On the 2nd of this month, a carpenter named Gong Axiao accidentally touched the wire while working and was electrocuted to death. The prosecutor of the First Special District Court confirmed the death. Under investigation, Hua Tanmu Yan Aqing and others from the police station believed that Chen Xianggen, as someone in this business, should have known the dangers involved. Using such dangerous wires instead of new wires was a case of neglecting business, resulting in death. Therefore, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi filed a public prosecution based on Articles 291, 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. This morning, Chen Xianggen was summoned by the First Special Court. Chen's供词 was evasive. He first said that the wires were installed by workers he had ordered, and then said that they were installed by the carpenters themselves. Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court believed that the case required further investigation and ordered a postponement of the hearing. Chen Xianggen was released on bail of 500 yuan to await the hearing.</p>
<p>Taicang Pawnshop Manager Arrested for Embezzling Large Sums of Money and Transferred to Taicang County Government for Interrogation</p>
<p>Gu Shou Xian, a Suzhou native and manager of Jitai Pawnshop in Taicang County, embezzled 300,000 yuan from the pawnshop and fled to Shanghai, hiding at No. 520 Dagu Road. The creditors found out and reported it to the local government, which sent detectives to track him down. They were arrested by the police and sent to the First Special District Court, which ordered them to be detained for investigation. It is now learned that the Taicang County Government, after the returning detectives reported it, prepared a transfer letter and consulted the First Special District Court, requesting that Gu be taken back for investigation. This morning, Judge Qian Wenqi took the chair and ordered Gu's case to be brought up and announced the letter from Taicang. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that, regarding the request for transfer from the mainland government, the police did not object to the transfer because the crime committed by the defendant was in Taicang. Judge Qian then ordered Gu Shou Xian to be handed over to the officials from the Taicang County Government in court and taken back for trial.</p>

<p>A Summary of Japanese Aviation</p>
<p>Edited by Xu Yuanruo</p>
<p>The entire book has 90 pages, paper six 开本, the actual price is 25 cents.</p>
<p>In General Weng Zhaoyuan's memoir of the Battle of Songhu, the following descriptions and feelings about Japanese aircraft were mentioned:</p>
<p>"At this time, the sky was already slightly bright, and enemy planes appeared in the sky again. They scouted everywhere without any scruples and dropped incendiary bombs and bombs at any time, causing fires everywhere."</p>
<p>"I often thought that if we had an air force equal to the enemy's in this Battle of Songhu, I believe our battle record would definitely exceed the expectations of ordinary people. Not to mention bombing their battleships and aircraft carriers, just stopping their planes from freely scouting and bombing in the air would be enough to give us an advantage. The power of aircraft against an enemy without resistance is truly incredible."</p>
<p>"This battle gave me a great feeling. When Japanese planes wantonly dropped bombs on us, they flew all over the sky with ease and without any scruples… To deal with aircraft, we only have aircraft ourselves before we have any other inventions. If we had half the number of planes, the enemy planes would not be able to drop bombs at will. If we had the same number of planes, the enemy planes would not dare to move lightly. If we had a superior air force, we could control the victory of this war… The Battle of Shanghai is not the last foreign war. The effectiveness of aircraft will become greater in the future. Are we going to look at our many defenseless metropolises and people receiving a second loss with the same eyes after receiving such a serious and painful lesson for the first time?"</p>
<p>From the above descriptions and feelings of General Weng, we can already know the losses caused to us by Japanese aircraft. However, General Weng said well, "The Battle of Shanghai is not our last foreign war." Here, our research on Japanese aviation is very necessary! This book is precisely written in response to this need.</p>
<p>This book was compiled by Mr. Xu Yuanruo with reference to various aviation publications published in Japan. The book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter describes the past, present, and future of Japanese aviation, and gives a comprehensive description of Japan's efforts in aviation. From here, we can know that the development of Japanese aviation is only a matter of the last ten years or so. Before the European War, Japanese aviation was still very naive. But after the European War, with the efforts of the government and the common struggle of the people, they actually laid the foundation for military aviation in just over ten years. Now, Japan's aviation industry is still far behind European and American countries, but with the concerted efforts of the whole country, the future is unlimited. How are they working hard? This chapter has a detailed and concrete description of this point. The second chapter generally describes the objective environment of Japanese aviation, pointing out Japan's dangerous position under the pressure of large-scale air forces of European and American powers, and its redoubled efforts for air force and air defense equipment caused by this pressure. The third chapter describes the Trans-Pacific problem. According to the editor in the preface: "The reason why the Trans-Pacific problem is listed in a separate chapter in the book is because even three-foot-tall children in Japan have a deep impression of this problem. The奥论界 in that country believes that once the Trans-Pacific problem is solved, the economic and military relationship between Japan and the United States will become closer and tense in the future, so it has loudly called on the people and finally received a great response. Therefore, this problem can be said to be of great significance in Japanese aviation." How is Japan working hard on this problem? What kind of response has its loud call received? And what is its important significance? This chapter has a detailed introduction. The fourth chapter describes Japan's juvenile air force. The juvenile air force is unique to Japan, and all countries in the world pay the greatest attention to it. This chapter describes its training situation in detail, which is very借鉴. The fifth chapter is a miscellaneous record, attached to describe Japan's other equipment for the aviation industry, as well as Japan's two air defense exercises in Osaka and Moji Kitakyushu the year before last, which are very interesting. In short, in order to understand the strength of the Japanese air force, its position in the world air force, and how we should work hard, read this book.</p>

<p>Push  Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>Two or three months ago, the newspaper seemed to have published a piece of news saying that a newspaper boy stepped on the footboard of a tram to get newspaper money, accidentally stepped on the hem of a descending passenger, and the man was furious. With a strong push, the child fell under the tram. The tram had just started moving and could not stop in time, crushing the child to death. The person who pushed the child away had long disappeared. But the hem of the coat being stepped on shows that the person was wearing a long gown, and even if not a "higher-class Chinese," must have been of a superior class.</p>
<p>Walking on the streets of Shanghai, one can often encounter two kinds of people who rush around, never yielding to pedestrians in front of or facing them. One type does not use their hands, but only lifts their straight legs, as if entering an uninhabited place. If you don't give way, they will even step on your stomach or shoulders. These are 洋大人, all "superior," with no distinction between upper and lower classes like the Chinese. The other type has two arms thrust out, palms facing outwards, like the two pincers of a 螃蟹, pushing all the way forward, regardless of whether the person being pushed falls into a mud puddle or a fire pit. These are our compatriots, but "superior" ones. They take trams, wanting to sit in third-class cars converted from second-class ones. They read newspapers, wanting to read small newspapers that specialize in publishing inside stories, swallowing their saliva as they read. But once they start moving, they start pushing again. Getting on the bus, entering a door, buying tickets, mailing letters, they push; leaving a door, getting off the bus, avoiding disasters, fleeing, they push again. They push women and children, making them stagger and fall. They step over the living, and when they die, they step over the corpses, and walk outside, licking their thick lips with their tongue, feeling nothing.</p>
<p>In a theater on the Old Lunar Festival Dragon Boat, again it was pushing because of a rumor of fire, trampling more than a dozen young people with insufficient strength to death. The corpses were placed in an open space, and it is said that more than 10,000 people went to see, a sea of people, pushing again. After pushing, they grinned and said, "Oh, how funny." Living in Shanghai, it is impossible not to encounter pushing and trampling, and this pushing and trampling also has to spread out. To push down all the weak among the lower-class Chinese, to trample down all lower-class Chinese. At this time, only the higher-class Chinese remain, singing blessings: "Oh, how funny. For the sake of preserving culture, any material sacrifice should not be spared. What is the importance of these materials!"</p>
<p>The Origin of Flower Drum Opera   He Ruyu</p>
<p>I have seen the Beijing opera "Da Huagu," and also read the play "Huagu" in Zhuibaiqiu, and I suspect that Huagu originated in Fengyang, starting in the early Ming Dynasty. Huagu Fengyang song says: "Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang was originally a good place. Since Emperor Zhu came out, nine out of ten years have been barren. Rich families sell their fields, and poor families sell their children. Only my family has nothing to sell, so we carry gongs and drums and walk the streets." According to the Ming Dynasty's imperial records, there were frequent famines in the early Ming Dynasty. The song means that Fengyang suffered from famine at that time, and poor families sold their children if they had them, otherwise they would play the flower drum and beg for a living. It is said that about three miles outside the north gate of Fengyang City, in the fields, there are five huge iron cauldrons. According to legend, in the past, there were wars and continuous years of famine, and there was famine in northern Anhui. The Ming Emperor, remembering the people's difficulties, ordered officials to provide porridge to relieve the disaster here, and the iron cauldrons were used to cook porridge at that time. It is said that each cauldron of porridge was enough to feed 500 people, which shows its large volume. From this, it can be said that Fengyang suffered famine during the Ming Dynasty, and there is still irrefutable evidence to this day. Now let's copy a short song from "Huagu":</p>
<p>"Xianhua Tune"</p>
<p>"The body is carrying a flower drum"</p>
<p>"淨持鑼跳上"</p>
<p>"旦" Hand-carrying a gong.</p>
<p>Husband and wife are loving, and never leave him.</p>
<p>"合" We can also sing, traveling through prefectures and crossing houses, walking as fast as a梭 with both feet.</p>
<p>Smile when meeting people, and sing eloquently.</p>
<p>"贴" Elegant young men are watching me, not afraid of many people in the drama court, this is because of money, there is no way.</p>
<p>"淨" Dongdong strikes the drum on the long street, attracting elegant young men.</p>
<p>"贴" Seeing that others are happy, silver money and copper coins roll out.</p>
<p>These flower drum girls are just like Gypsy women, earning a living by selling art in all directions. In the flower drum operas popular in Hunan, there is a kind called "Wang San Sells Meat," in which the flower drum elder sister says: "My family lives in Fengyang Prefecture, and I have learned to sing and write." There is also a kind called "Prostitute Passes the Pass," whose flower drum prostitute also comes from northern Anhui, passing through Wuhu, but it is not clearly stated that she is from Fengyang. I think whether the flower drum started in the early Ming Dynasty, and whether Fengyang is the place where the flower drum first originated, is certainly not without doubt. If only to say that since the Ming Dynasty, Fengyang has been a famous production area for flower drums, then it is clearly verifiable. Also, Ouyang Yuqian discussed Huagu in his article "Drama in Hankou." He briefly said that in the Song Dynasty there was so-called Yaxue Opera, and there was also so-called Cunli Yagu in the song brand. Flower Drum Opera may be the遗 of Yaxue Opera, which is also unknown. I think that there was only Yazhugu Opera in the Song Dynasty, and I don't know where Ouyang's so-called Yaqiang came from. Continuing Moke Huixi Volume Seven says: "When Prince Chun first calmed Xhe River, the border was peaceful. During the martial arts, he taught the soldiers to play Yazhugu Opera, and it became popular in the world in a few years. The state of their actions, dance costumes, and the words of the actors were all made by Prince Chun himself. It is said that when Chun Chu faced the Westerners, before the soldiers fought, Chun Chu ordered hundreds of soldiers to dress up as Yazhugu teams and surround the army. The captives were all surprised and stunned, and the troops fought bravely, breaking them greatly." Using soldiers to dress up as Yazhugu and using Yazhugu to break the enemy is both war and art. Prince Chushun is indeed a lovable person! Also, Zhu Ziyu Record Volume 139 says: "Such as dancing Yazhugu, there are men, women, monks, and Taoists of various colors, but they are all fake." It can be known that Yazhugu was created by Prince Chushun in the Northern Song Dynasty, and after the Southern Crossing, it became more and more popular. But it is not easy to determine whether today's flower drum is the 遗 of Yazhugu. I think that in the Song Dynasty, there was still so-called Da Yehu, which was quite similar to today's ground flower drum. The ground flower drum means a flower drum that does not require a stage and is performed on the ground. Meng Yuanlao's Tokyo Menghualu says: "In December, there are poor people, 三教人, in one fire, dressed as women, gods, and ghosts,敲锣击鼓, begging for money from house to house, commonly called Da Yehu." Yunlu Manchao also has a section on Da Yehu, briefly saying that when the year is about to end, the villagers come together to perform Nuo, which is called Da Yehu in slang. In short, the origin of the flower drum is very early. What we can assume is that Da Yagu, Da Yehu, and Da Huagu are similar in pronunciation and similar in events. It is probably due to the circulation of slang that one event has three names. Now it is generally called flower drum.</p>
<p>Seven Days in a Hospital Bed (Continued)  Ms. Xiong Xiang</p>
<p>May 24th</p>
<p>What I didn't expect was that my sister-in-law came. She brought the child alone to look for my brother from thousands of miles away. Meng Jiangnv searched for her husband for thousands of miles, and my sister-in-law can also be regarded as searching for her husband for thousands of miles. Humans are really strange. People who were unrelated in the past, once they become husband and wife, they will become so intimate. For example, myself, from now on, Mingge has almost become my own life, but my parents, sisters, and sisters who are related to me by flesh and blood have become indifferent. When Mingge had a serious illness last year, I almost risked my life to save him, and I don't know how many tears I shed. This year, my father is already in a critical condition, but I am living my life calmly and don't feel any sadness. This psychology really makes me feel strange. I don't know how these two completely different emotions can arise in my heart. Logically speaking, I should grieve my biological father more than my husband, but I don't. The reason is not that my father treated me badly. I asked Mingge about this question, and he said, "Because we are now in a relationship where our interests are shared. When people have the same interests, they will unite." Did Mingge and I really fall in love because our interests were shared? Jingge came back from Nanjing and brought me a letter from my sister. My sister scolded me for not taking care of my body and said that I didn't know it when I escaped from death. These kind and affectionate words made me very moved. I couldn't help but feel emotional about my own life experience. A life is so fragile. What will life rely on?</p>

<p>Business News, Finance: Both Silver and Commodity Prices Rise, Appraiser Breaks Through the 900 Yuan Barrier, Dropping Sharply by 26.7 Yuan. Bulls Close Positions, Bears Increase Bets, Lowest at 890.5 Yuan. Although the gold market only traded for half a day yesterday, the falling trend was dismal, breaking through the 900 Yuan barrier and creating a new low since the abolition of taels and the conversion to Yuan (equivalent to 636.7 taels per Yuan). This was mainly due to overnight exchange rate expectations of decline. Yesterday, British and American rates had already declined, unexpectedly, American and British rates rose sharply, spot silver prices on the Precious Metals Exchange, as well as American cotton, American wheat, and private telegrams all rose in unison. Stock prices also rose more than they fell. Small-scale short positions were liquidated immediately, and large bullish investors emerged one after another. The exchange market was extremely firm, and HSBC's listed price also increased. As soon as the 900 Yuan barrier was broken, the falling trend intensified. However, due to vigorous purchases from Guangdong banks, there was a rebound of more than six Yuan. Unfortunately, most bullish investors failed to capitalize on the situation. Fellow traders aggressively sold US dollars, and bearish investors boldly increased their bets, causing buyers to be at a loss. Market sentiment was extremely weary, and selling pressure was frequent, which was a reaction to the multi-day support. In general, the market situation in the second half was entirely dominated by sellers, as the recent environment seems difficult to be optimistic about. Within the exchange, Yuan Chun, Da De Cheng, Da Xing, Yong Zhao Feng, Chang Fu Yu, etc., were the most active in selling. The fixed red price was increased by 77 Yuan. The market situation for the half-day is recorded as follows: the morning opening was 905.8 Yuan, down 12.7 Yuan from the previous close. Commodity prices opened at 5.5 Yuan. The exchange market opened with British hard currency at 125, and American hard currency at 375. Recent selling prices were calculated as British exchange at 1 shilling 3 and 3/4 pence, and American exchange at 26.4375 Yuan. Fu Yu, Da De Cheng, Hong Li Zhi, and Chang all sold, while Yuan Chun and Tai Chang bought. The banking market was still good, and was able to rebound. By September, US dollars at 0.0625 and 0.125 were difficult to sell. Zhao Feng Chang, Da Xing Yong, and Li sold, and reached one Yuan. Mai Jia Li bought September US dollars at 0.1875, and July US dollars at 0.075 were difficult to settle. Yuan Mao vigorously bought, and Hong Li also bought, rising to 4.5 Yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced, with British increasing by 0.125 and American increasing by 0.375. At this time, prices had already fallen. Pan Gen offered September US dollars at 0.1875 again. Yuan Mao, Yong Yi Feng, and Yong Zheng frantically sold, gradually declining. Before long, even 0.025 was difficult to sell. Da De Cheng, Zheng Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Hong Li Chun, Yuan Yong Tian Feng Yong, etc., jointly sold strips, breaking through the 900 Yuan barrier and falling to 896.5 Yuan. HSBC accepted September US dollars at 0.025. Fu Yu, Tong Yi, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., jointly bought strips, gradually stabilizing again. An Da continuously bought October US dollars from 0.4375 to 0.3125. Heng Xing aggressively increased bets, rising to over 903 Yuan. Unfortunately, market sentiment and the exchange market remained bad. Heng Yu and Qing Fa Yong came to sell again, retreating to within 900 Yuan. Hua Bi once bought September at 0.025, struggling around 900 Yuan. After entering, the exchange market continued to be firm. Zhao Feng Chang, Wan Xing Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Chun Yuan Xing Yong, Da De Cheng Yi Feng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, etc., sold first. At this time, although Mai Jia Li bought October US dollars at 0.4375, even a thousand Yuan was not wanted, and the trend was rapidly declining. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Chang, and Ri Chang sold even more, falling to 93.3 Yuan. An Da bought October US dollars at 0.5625, and Hua Bi bought July at 0.4375. Yuan Mao continued to buy, raising the price to 5 Yuan. However, due to extremely weary market sentiment, the overall trend was difficult to reverse. Bullish investors flocked to sell, and large investors such as Fu Yu Yuan, Sheng Yong Zai, and Xing Yong relentlessly sold, retreating to 0.05 Yuan. Heng Xing Bing Xing advanced to 2.8 Yuan, but still declined. Yuan Xing Yong Zheng Chang also accepted. The afternoon closing was 891.8 Yuan. After the closing, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., sold, retreating from over 3 Yuan to within 90 Yuan. Commodity prices were auctioned at 91.5 Yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 906.2 Yuan, and the lowest price was 890.5 Yuan, a difference of 15.7 Yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 26.7 Yuan compared to the previous close. The listed price increased because HSBC's US dollar listing price increased by 0.375, to 26 Yuan. The standard gold price was 923 Yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 31 Yuan. The remaining was 13 Yuan more than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 905 Yuan, and for July it was 892 Yuan. The morning supplemental water was 905 Yuan. The fixed red price was increased by 77 Yuan, with no source, so transactions were scarce. For June and July swaps, Rui Kang initially offered Tong Yi seven strips, at 11 Yuan, but later cancelled. There were still 4,879 strips remaining in June. Almost all transactions in the exchange were dominated by sellers. The short positions were liquidated a lot and bearish investors increased their bets, occupying a superior position. In summary, Heng Xing Yuan Mao, Tong Yi Tong, Tai Chang Yuan Xing Yong Nei, and Xing, etc., were on the buying side. Zhao Feng Chang, Da Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Zheng Chang Hong Li, Yuan Sheng Yong, Yuan Chun Chun, Yuan Yong Yi Feng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, Ri Chang Heng Yu Zhi Feng Yong, and Dalian banks, etc., all sold. Guangdong's Heng Xing bought about 600 strips. The majority of the July chips were held by Dalian banks Wan Xing Shun Li, totaling more than 6,860 strips. Qian Chang Xiang Yuan Heng Fu, Chang Heng Xing were all above 1,000. Zhi Feng Yong had over 800, and Yuan Chun had over 700. Zheng Chang had over 500. The short side was mostly Da De Cheng with over 4,000 strips. Rui Xing had over 1,700, Tong Feng Heng had 3,150 strips, Yi Yu had over 900, and Da Xing Yong Hong Xing had over 700 each. Yuan Mao Yong had over 600, for a total of 20,769 strips. British and American Exchange Rates Loosen Greatly. According to foreign telegrams, London spot and forward rates both increased by 0.1875. Although the listed silver price in New York decreased by 0.125, the actual transactions increased by 0.125. Although British rates against the US declined by half a point, unexpectedly, US rates against British rates suddenly increased by 0.125. In addition, American wheat and American cotton rose in unison, so the exchange market was firm. The morning opening selling price for recent trades was calculated as British exchange at 1 shilling 3 and 3/4 pence, and American exchange at 26.4375 Yuan, decreasing by 0.125 for British and 0.375 for American compared to the previous close. After the opening, gold firms sought to sell US dollars, and the banks' appetite changed from perfunctory to sluggish. When HSBC's listing price was announced, British increased by 0.125 and American increased by 0.375, and the disclosed situation worsened. However, due to the vigorous buying from Guangdong banks and An Da, the situation changed from loose to tight. In the end, supply exceeded demand, gradually becoming firm. Buyers lacked appetite. By the time of the noon closing, the selling price for recent trades was British exchange at 1 shilling 3 and a half pence, increasing by 0.025, and American exchange at 26.8125 Yuan, decreasing by 0.075 compared to the previous close. In the banking sector, An Da, Mai Jia Li, and HSBC aggressively bought American dollars, while Pan Gen sold. Gold firms aggressively sold about 400,000 US dollars. The transactions for the half-day are recorded as follows: The morning opening selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling 3 and 3/4 pence. Hua Bi sold to Zheng... August at 0.4375, Hua Bi sold to Dongfang October at 0.0625. By the time of the noon closing, the selling price ranged from 1 shilling 3 and a half pence to 0.0625.

<p>Securities Market: Bond Market Listless Amid Bull and Bear Stalemate, Price Differences Slight. Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was sluggish, with minimal fluctuations. The price difference was as little as 5 fen or 1 jiao, indicating a strong stalemate between bulls and bears. As a result, trading activity was significantly reduced. Trading throughout the day was extremely listless. This phenomenon is common on Saturdays. In terms of trends, the first lot in the morning was slightly lower by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao, but rebounded by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao after 19 post-settlement. The second lot rose by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao, while the consolidated tax fell by 0.05 and 0.1 jiao. The afternoon's two lots were even more sluggish, with each lot fluctuating by only 0.05 or 0.1 jiao, with both increases and decreases.

<p>New York Stock Market Mixed. According to a report from New Fung Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on Friday (9th) opened lower because the House of Representatives revoked a clause in the railway proposal, preventing the merger of Postal Telegraph and Western Union Telegraph, causing the prices of the two stocks to decline immediately, and the entire stock market was depressed as a result. Later, due to continued weakness in the US exchange rate and extreme heat in the Western Midwest, wheat prices soared, and the stock market rebounded strongly. As a result, the market showed mixed results compared to the previous day. The total turnover for the day was 5,310,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left: Closing Price Change from Previous Day 30 Industrial Stocks 94.29 Up 0.77 20 Railroad Stocks 43.00 Down 0.04 20 Utility Stocks 34.51 Up 0.29 40 Bonds 84.64 Down 0.13.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Market Yarn and Cotton Prices Rebound with External Cotton, Yarn Market Declines for Three Consecutive Days, Prompting Profit-Taking. The US cotton price rebounded, boosting market sentiment. There was also some activity in speculative buying, but actual demand remained sluggish, and economic conditions across the board were difficult to loosen, resulting in weak purchasing power.

Buying interest surged, and market prices rose by more than one Yuan (standard yarn rebounded by more than one Yuan). Standard yarn opened in the morning, slightly rising with external cotton. Due to limited sales of spot yarn, prices for various months increased by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao.

<p>Cotton Market Surges Due to Slightly Higher External Cotton Prices and Depleted Inventory of Local Old Cotton. Buyers seized the opportunity to squeeze short positions. However, the yarn market was poor, and factories were in a difficult situation. Factories did not purchase high-priced raw materials. Market prices fluctuated sharply. The Ningbo group actively sold. In the afternoon, there were rumors that US cotton prices would rise sharply next week, and new buyers increased significantly, causing market prices to rise (Zheng Biao bought more). Zheng Biao opened in the morning, rising with external cotton, with firmer market sentiment. Prices for various months increased by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 jiao.

<p>Excellent Weather for American New Cotton Crop. The telegram on the 9th reported on the cotton market situation for the week. At the beginning of the week, news from Washington that there was hope for a reduction in cotton production this season, at least by 20%, stimulated the buying of raw cotton. However, it is universally agreed that it is difficult to find or subsidize a sufficient amount of reduction at the current market price of cotton. Therefore, a reaction occurred. The low value of the US dollar and the strong stock market prices still attracted a lot of buying. The tendency for bullish investors to take profits increased with the report of excellent weather. The Red Cross continued to sell cotton inventories, estimated at only 50,000 bales, which have not yet been priced. Currently, about 90% to 95% of the cotton crop has been planted, but fruit borers have been found in many places in the southern cotton belt. The cotton market was relatively quiet this week, but manufacturers' attitudes were firm, and bullish sentiment was evident. However, some merchants believe that the possibility of the Washington authorities undertaking to reduce cotton acreage has prevented a sharp drop in cotton prices.</p>
<p>Grain and Rice Market: Rain Calms Prices (South Shanghai). Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources, and due to continuous rain, the number of buyers declined, so order volume did not increase. Only local stores made some purchases. However, the market was tight on the selling side, so prices remained stable. Furthermore, Su Tong japonica rice may still see some price increases. Only the Pinghu group placed one or two orders for Du Yang tip rice, and the price was not significantly different. The price of Yin Bian Yuan was not quoted. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 12 or 13 ships arrived from various routes in Hexia. Due to the rain, few goods were listed on the market, so the sales of various items were slow. Although there were slight increases, the quantity sold was limited. The prices of various goods fluctuated greatly. Xiang Gan indica rice was seen as declining. Local stores and the Ningbo group were eager to purchase cart rice. Yesterday, the situation in the foreign market was quite flat. Even Hexia tip rice and other goods were flat. This was because none of the northern and southern groups had a strong appetite. Northern foreign rice was briefly active, then quickly became wait-and-see. The Tong group, which was the most active in the southern route, only welcomed high-grade indica rice and brown rice. Recently, there have been few arrivals of high-grade indica rice and various types of brown rice, and inventories were insufficient. Most of the rice was medium-grade indica rice. Local buyers were interested in the medium-grade goods from Xiang Gan, so the market was seen as declining. Yesterday, local stores and the Ningbo group actively purchased Nanjing indica rice. The quantity on hand was small, and the price immediately increased by 8 fen. It was estimated that 1,300 bags were sold, priced from 7.4 to 7.45 Yuan. Local stores also purchased 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice, priced at 8.25 Yuan, the same as the previous market. Due to the support of foreign merchants, market prices were very stable. The Fuzhou group only had 290 bags of Hunan machine oil rice, priced at 8.4 Yuan.</p>
<p>Noodle Market: Morning Was Strong, Afternoon Was Weak. After the market opened in the morning, the prices for various months showed a strong trend, with foreign wheat quotations rising by about 4, 5, and 6 jiao. Since the weather was continuously rainy, and it was the peak season for the new wheat harvest, market sentiment was naturally shaken. Therefore, after the opening, market prices for various months rose by about 1.5 fen compared to the previous day. At that time, the Yantai group also had some transactions, making market sentiment feel quite excited. However, the various factories continued to sell, so the market weakened again. By the time the afternoon market opened, the market sentiment for various months weakened again. With the guest groups' appetite declining and the factories selling slightly more, and because the gold market had fallen below 900 Yuan, market sentiment became even softer. Near and distant periods declined frequently. The US wheat borrowed by the government was estimated to be 360,000 tons of wheat and 4,000,000 bags of flour. With this in mind, the future outlook was less optimistic. As a result, this month was down by 2.5 li, July was unchanged, August and September were down by 5 li, October was down by 7.5 li, and November was down by 5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Market: Turned from Rising to Flat. After the wheat futures market opened in the morning, although the prices for various months showed a strong trend, with foreign wheat quotations rising by 4, 5, and 6 jiao, the rainy weather may have affected the future wheat harvest. Therefore, at the time of opening, July rose to 4.1 Yuan, and August rose to 4.19 Yuan, an increase of 5 to 6 fen compared to the previous day. However, due to the continued sales by selling firms, the market weakened again. By the time the afternoon market opened, due to the poor noodle market and the large drop in gold prices, market sentiment softened again. The weather was not very good after all, and the degree of decline was not much. As a result, this month was slightly better by 2 fen compared to the previous day, August and September were better by 2 fen, October was unchanged, November was better by 2 fen in the morning, and the afternoon market did not open. The arrival of new wheat was not smooth, and prices remained stable. After opening the machine, there were 415 bags of wheat, priced at 4 Yuan.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Surges. A telegram from Chicago on the 9th stated that wheat prices rose due to extreme heat in the US Midwest and strong buying and short covering. Furthermore, the estimated yield of this year's winter wheat harvest was 341,000,000 bushels, compared to 462,151,000 bushels last year. Closing Price Change from Previous Day July 75.375 Up 1.875 September 77.12 Up 2.125 December 79.500 Up 2.000.</p>
<p>Jiading New Broad Beans Also Listed. The production of Jiading new broad beans this year was higher than in previous years, and the number of products was also larger. Yesterday, the first batch of over 800 bags arrived, priced at 5 Yuan, and were purchased by foreign firms. Ningbo broad beans also opened at 5 Yuan, but the market gradually declined compared to the first batch. Yesterday, a total of 1,200 bags were sold, all purchased by foreign firms. Today, the Geng group holds the principle of not buying anything that is not cheap, so the supply of goods will likely flood the market, making it difficult to expect the market to be good.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Qi Men Black Tea Sells Well to England. Since Qi Men black tea was launched on the market, the sales volume has reached more than 30,000 boxes. However, the market price of Qi Fu top and medium grade goods has gradually fallen to 70 to 80 Yuan. The prices of goods from Qiu Pu Jian De and other routes have also fallen by 50 to 60 Yuan. The losses suffered by the companies are heartbreaking. Recently, however, the market price has stabilized slightly, and demand from London has increased compared to before. Yesterday, Yi He Jin Long Bao Chang Tian Yu and many other firms have started trading. The sales of flower fragrance are particularly active in England, and the black tea market has seen a slight recovery. The sales of Zhen Mei from Tunxi Wu Dong Wenzhou and other routes of green tea are not slow, and the prices of Ping Shui Tu Zhuang pearl tea are firm. Wu Dong Gong Xi is also quite popular, while the rest are still trending sluggishly. The quality of improved silkworm cocoons for reeling is not high. (The price of improved silkworm cocoons in Suzhou is high). The Suzhou Shanren Bridge New Village improved silkworm breeding area cooperated with the Suzhou Agricultural School this year, while the Huguan area was guided by the Women's Silkworm School. The results were excellent, and the cocoon production was abundant and the cocoon body was good. The silk firms offered high prices to compete for the cocoons. The highest price for improved silkworm cocoons was 60 Yuan per Sima scale, while the price for local cocoons was 35 to 36 Yuan. The cocoon market in Mu Du Heng Jing will end. (The price of new cocoons in Jiangyin is not low). This year's silkworm egg production was only 13 to 14 years old. Although the harvest was abundant, the production of new cocoons was difficult to increase. Few cocoon firms rented out facilities, and most of the farmers dried the cocoons themselves. At the opening, the cocoon firms competed for high-quality cocoons, and the silkworm farmers did not sell at low prices, so the price was not low. The cocoon firms in Changjing Da Xiao Qing Yang Changshou and other villages have already stopped weighing cocoons. The price for foreign high-quality cocoons was 55 to 56 Yuan, while the price for local cocoons was 28.9 Yuan, averaging about 40 Yuan. (New cocoons in Zhenjiang are transported to Shanghai in batches). The cocoon markets in various villages and towns have gradually ended. The fresh cocoons collected by the cocoon merchants have been dried and transported to Shanghai in batches. It is estimated that 70% to 80% were transported by land, and the Beijing-Shanghai freight trains have already loaded over 1,000 bags. (The reeling loss for foreign cocoons in Wuxi is small).

<h3>North China Special Police Organization Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Luo Gonghua during an internal discussion, Huang Shaoxiong went from Shanghai to Hong Kong to transfer to Guangdong. The departure date was not mentioned.

It is speculated that Huang will definitely leave within a few days. Regarding the organizational plan for the special police in North China after the war, it is currently being drafted. The command of the police will be decided by the Hebei Provincial Government, and local command will be taken by the county magistrates.

<h3>Improvement of Chinese Tea in Progress</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Tinghu, Director of the Agricultural Department, said that in order to improve Chinese tea, the Ministry has tea experimental fields in Xiushui, Jiangxi Province, the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute for planting, improving fields, baking, and drying. Other tea-producing provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui are also being ordered to handle experimental fields one after another. According to reports, Zhejiang has already established several places, and the results are good. Currently, the fundamental way to rescue Chinese tea is to start with the tea farmers themselves. Relying solely on official experimental fields for improvement is limited to the scope of experimentation and cannot be popularized. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
