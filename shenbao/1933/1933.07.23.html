<p>此項恊定因須顧全有關係各國之昨益、及歐洲金本位國抱具阻撓態度、幾費唇舌始克商妥、規定一九三四年元旦起發生效力、各簽字國批准通知書須在明年四月一日以前送存華盛頓、</p>
<p>按照恊定、世界存銀最多之印度約定在四年内售銀不逾一萬四千萬盎斯、每年平均三千五百萬盎斯、西班牙政府約定每年所售不逾五百萬盎斯、中國政府則允不將銷燬銀幣所得之銀售出市塲、約内又規定印度一年間售銀倘若不足三千五百萬盎斯、則其差額得於下半年併售、但一年内所售總數不得超過五千萬盎斯、</p>

<p>春秋絲綢救國運動號國産絲綢不振之根本的探討  王思素　　絲綢是我國的上選産物，高尚華美，經久耐穿，據說有一個時期，亦當有獨步世界之勢··但是這個時期並不長，自經舶來品盛銷於中國後，中國人自己便首先厭棄國産了。而厭棄的動機，並不是察破國産之不如舶來，更不是舶來的價錢廉於國産；相反的，舶來的實質或且不如國産，不過花樣新巧，而價錢更每每高出數倍。那麽，國人之厭棄國産，究竟是什麽原因，動機何在呢？這却可一言以蔽··無非是重人輕己的卑劣心理所造成而己···再說得明白點··便是重視外國人，聯帶重視外國貨物，及其一切制度，輕視本國人，聯帶輕視本國貨物，及所有一切制度；服用不過一端，好像一個人不服用舶來品，便不足爲高等華人似的。由這等人以身作則，造成風氣，引起他人盲從，便弄到今日舶來盛銷，國産不振的地步！縱成這等人遇到某種時期，須出偏師增高自己地位，提倡服用國産，但自己仍不能不服用舶來品；原因所在，也還是這麽一種心理在役使他。所以我們要勸人穿國産綢緞的衣服，單是勸，斷然無效，也必須從根本上喚醒國人的卑劣心理，恢復固有的自尊心。豈但服用一端，如果大家都没有了這種卑劣心理，同時又不但恢復了固有的自尊心，而且自尊向上，那簡直連整個的國家强盛，也可以立而待了。購到國人的卑劣心理的形成，眞是說來話長。在最初，中國不是國，是天下，天上没有兩個日，地上没有兩個王，四方的小國，都是外夷，這自尊，實在是到了頂嶺，五千年來，一直到鴉片之役，總是這麽自尊着。就只可惜祇自尊而昧於知識，反爲異族所乘！自江寗五口通商之條約締定，硬性的槍砲侵略和柔性的經濟侵略，便如暴風雨似的不斷的襲來，使中國外瀋盡失，門户洞開，滅亡之禍，迫於眉睫。然而國人仍是那麽眼高於頂的自尊着，却又打不退異族，心裏大不服氣，徒呼負負，於是激成了庚子的對外大仇視，不管靑紅皂白，看見了洋人便是殺，惹來了八國聯軍，五千年的古國，幾乎就在這一役亡掉。經過這一敎訓，國人的對外心裏，就大大地轉變了，自尊心這纔消滅，仇視也不敢，轉變而爲懼怕洋人。後來復由懼怕洋人轉變爲諂媚洋人，崇拜洋人，在淸季，差不多是官民一致的諂媚崇拜。待到革命潮流，勃然興起，新人物不比舊人物，說諂媚固未免太過，他們多數是親歷外洋，親眼看到外國的種種文明進化，雖不諂媚，而崇拜依然。再把崇拜的字義减輕一點，便只好說重視了，這似乎到現在並無轉變。　　人不能没有自尊心，尤其要知識階級首先覺悟轉變，解鈴繫鈴，也是那麽以身作則的服用國産，造成風氣；而第一步卽自提倡國産絲綢始。做好事  醉痴生　　「太太！奶奶！小姐！請你們大慈大悲，救苦救難，救命王菩薩，做做好事吧。」在下這樣很誠懇地呼籲。　　做什麽好事呢？並不是要你們破鈔，做那消極的慈善事業。這好事並非别樣，就是從自己身上做起。大家實行起來，一則可以救國，二則可以救民。像這樣盛大的好事，祗須一念的轉移，再便當也没有，又何樂而不爲呢？　　講到身上的問題，最要緊是衣服。那裸體運動，倒底是不行的。至於女人的衣服，不但遮身暖體，還要求其美觀。尤其是都市中的女士們，衣服最爲講究。但是目的錯誤，選購衣料，往往非舶來品的綢緞不辦，價錢愈貴愈好。風尚所趨，國産綢緞，除少數男子服用之外，簡直要漸歸淘汰之列。以致洋貨充斥，利權外溢，每年不知達若干萬了。國産絲綢事業，反一落千丈。如杭州湖州等處的絲綢織機廠，因市塲的慘落，大半相繼閉歇。因此失業的工人，也不知凡幾。實業不振，農村衰落。這都是女士們一念之差，有以致之。在女士們的心理；以宜用外國來路貨，纔算得時髦。倘用國貨綢緞，好像帶些壽頭色彩。這就是爲一時虚榮心與好奇心所驅使，大誤而特誤。結果，弄得國弱民貧。思想起來，眞於心何忍？所以在下請求女士們，要糾正以前謬誤的心理，打倒以前不良的習慣，從此以後，不穿衣服則己，要穿衣服，終要用國産。以身作則，歷久不變。那末，國産漸形暢銷，洋貨自然落後。實業復與，失業的工人，也不愁没飯吃。金錢不外流，國勢自可漸臻富强。這豈不是「救國救民」「功德無置」的好事嗎？女士們，快快起來實行吧！絲綢業的各方面努力之方法  小淸女士　　從「人道主義」及「物道主義」的原則而論，人們就根本上不當用絲綢，尤其是現在的時候，何以故呢？俞曲　先生也說過，因人們外表之舒適，使數千萬的生命，受盡水火之刑，我們試閉目想想人之不仁，實再無以加之，這是物道的說法·又以人道而論，所謂衣被天下，不是衣被最少數的特殊階級·現在世界上穿到絲綢者至多佔萬分之一·尤其不對的，生産者反絶對穿用不到，多麽的不人道·　　但是世界上還没有一種東西，能代替絲綢，除非等到將來科學再發達些·照目前的情勢，絲綢决不能廢止，我們且談談他努力的方法··第一技術上要急起直追中國樣樣落伍，發明火藥，而上於黑藥；登明印刷，而止於木刻；（五代時雖有過活版，但未普遍，）發明絲綢，而爲日人後來居上，將絶跡於國際市塲；自植桑以至織染，一任毫無知議之婦孺，與利慾薫心之奸商，隨便處理，還是幾百年前原始的老法子·拿絲的平均度而論，與東洋絲相比，太相差了·若不因地土的特厚，恐怕國絲早爲他國絲代替巳盡，就在國内也無立足地了·尤可畏者，絲綢的染色及質地，遠不及毛織品，我們做一身西裝，穿十年二十年不算希罕，絲綢則二三年己狠舊，所以技術上不澈底的各項步步改良，中國絲綢永成歷史上之一名詞·這是數十年内可以看到的·（猶之日本絲之打倒華絲爲國中先覺者早己大聲疾呼者·）　　第二生産上要薄利多賣中國的商人，同政界先生一樣，不用他，他呌苦連天，用到他，他又架子十足，奇貨可居了·中國綢僅僅在華美上稍稍勝毛織品，但自民國後，價一再大漲，一件薄薄的長衣，要二十元一件，馬褂一件，也要十餘元，價旣飛漲，質則日落，僅僅在表面上做工夫，近年又完全加入人造絲騙人·其實在鎭江丹陽一帶，綢價比洋布便宜一小半，而遠有一分錢可餘·河南之汴綢，僅四五百文一尺·　各地多設生産合作社，勿使有人壟斷，使絲綢之價，不僅廉於洋布，並且不貴於毛織品，不可因一時銷路好，遂大漲價，而自絶於國人·　　第三消費上要通力合作商業政策，有儘先銷物於國内，先排出外貨，待有餘力，再傾銷於國外之一法·中國人口五萬萬，爲絶好之處女市塲·設法使全國不用外貨，均用國産之絲綢，朝野一致，實力提倡，以嚴密之組織出之·外國市塲，今後不大可靠，因以後之數十年内，世界將有大轉變，外國之用絲，不過用爲裝飾品，不如國内之作爲正當衣料也·湖州的絲綢  鵬子　　湖州，一直是以出産絲綢著名的，幾年前，正當絲綢業興盛的時代，這裏確曾是一個人民當庶的境域，那時全城綢廠林立織機達數萬架，每年能出綢數十萬至百萬疋，市内綢莊絲店，觸目皆是··一般鄉民，十九都以養靈做絲爲主要事業，每當春靈　育之際，跑出效外，但見一片翠綠，全是桑林，三五成羣的採桑娘子，攙筐剪桑，入其里，則鴉雀無聲，靜穆嚴肅，原來每家都正全神貫注於養靈，謝絶一切平時的親朋酬酢，及到蠶死繭成，有的便賣鮮繭給繭行，有的却自己繅成了絲賣，那時的絲價每百兩有六七十元，綢價達百元左右，鄉民於賣出絲繭之後，往往獲利甚多，同時絲綢的銷路甚廣，一般絲綢商人，營業發達，隨着這絲綢業的興盛，自然市内一切的商業也都興盛了。　　但自從世界經濟恐慌的颶風捲起以後，各國競求海外市塲，商戰日烈，由於日本絲之積極改良，致一向佔全世界第一位的中國出口絲日漸衰落，同時國内天災人禍，相繼頻仍，絲綢銷路旣滯，價復暴跌，（最近湖州市價，每百兩絲··約三十八九元，綢··四十元至六十元），在巳經給災禍摧殘得破産的農村裏，貧苦的農民往往借了重利的債，買葉養了蠶，而結果，有的是賠了勞力又折本，有的却連想折本點賣掉也没人要，於是甚有不得不當了絲來換米吃的··這情形應響到市内，自然各業都隨着衰落了。　　拿一地的情形可以喻全國，年來絲綢業的衰落，自然也就是造成中國經濟恐慌之一重大原因，爲謀挽救起見，最近當局曾有指導蠶桑，改良蠶種等之施行，但這將造出怎樣顯著的成績呢？却還是一個須要我們等待着去看的問題。女子的美化  阿絜　　審美觀念是人人所有的，尤其是女子最爲豐富。因爲女子的心思缜密，愛美出於天性，試看女子的喜歡裝飾，不是「愛美性」的表現嗎？花，有種　的顏色··　，有種種的色綵；山，水，　，霞，竹，樹，星，月····都從光　顯出色綵來，自然界裏，本來飽和了美化。人們能把自然物的美化，慕倣或創造起來，得到了美化的大成，來供欣賞，來調劑枯寂的人生，我們不能不佩服絲織品　綢緞縐葛等的創造者之有功於人類！　　據說··蠶絲的發明人，是黄帝的妃子嫘祖，這便是女子的富於愛美性的鐵證。否則衣皮披革，有甚麽美觀和文明！棉花據說是元代黄道婆，從外國帶進種子來的。那末，棉織品　紗布類　的發明，還没有幾百年了。這樣說來，可知我們中國人，一向是用絲織品的，甚麽絹，縑，紡，素，綃，繪，榖····，都是絲織品。古人所謂紗的，也是絲織品；六朝以後，諸類織物，以紗爲特重，用途也很廣，所謂「皂紗」「綘紗」烏紗都是。前淸末年，夏秋時候，「官紗」還很盛行。大槪紗是絹的一種吧。絲織品以外，還有蔴織品。詩經裏說··「爲絺爲綌」。禮記裏說··「巾以綌」。絺是細蔴布；綌是粗蔴布。還有一種夏天的衣服，呌做葛，是很盛行的。然而絲織品終占了最重要的地位。　　因爲絲織品，質美而細軟，不但章身，而且適體。女子當於愛美性，所以把絲織品研究起來；有了種種的不同名稱，便可以證明我們中國人對於絲織品的講究了。到了現在，美術一科，日益完美；女子的愛美性，也是益發達；爲求自身的美化起見，對於絲織品自然富於審美觀念，花樣啦，色綵啦，質地啦，很富於鑑别的眼力，而絲織品也日趨於進步了。這回上海市舉辦國貨綢緞展覽會，不單是提倡國貨，而且還提倡美術，女子要希望自身的美化，也該積極的起來提倡國産絲綢才是。以身作則  虎頭　　我對着開口提倡國貨，閉口提倡國貨一般仁兄，着實揑出一把冷汗。因爲我聽見這句話，己有好些年頭了，國貨的銷路，依然一蹶不振，其實都是這般人做壞的。當他高高的站在臺上勸人用國貨時，他自身穿着筆挺的西裝，没一件是我們大中華的貨物。試想··如此勸人，儘管言者諄諄，其如聽者藐藐何？　　我國絲綢之業，原爲出産大宗。近年因爲不知考究，外國市塲上幾乎不見踪影。國家强弱，軍備固然要緊··商戰也未始不是第二要着！照此情形，我要歎國亡無日了！　　其實中國絲綢，自有其可愛的價値！如用以製爲男式西裝··質軟者，若紡綢之類，可做襯衫襯褲。質堅者，若緞等，可製外衣。只須時用熨斗燙平，不比外貨耐穿美觀嗎？如用以製女式西裝，也有同樣功效。又如喜歡穿中裝的，那是長衫，夾衫，棉袍，皮袍，短衫，褲等，無一不可應用。且看幾個眞有錢的做人家人，此刻穿着竹筒式袖管的紡綢長衫，顏色花樣，儘許不入時，可是質堅耐用，怕有没有異議的罷？只可憐現在一般摩登的男士女士，只曉得新從外洋運來，此地還未有人穿着過，不論取價如何高貴，必得買來試試，顯得我是怎樣闊綽？如何摩登？我對這些人，實在没有話說了！　　難道就此消極麽？不！我以爲這件事，應由各個大團體以身作則··商界應由商會通告各同業公會，一體服用。學界應由大學中學生起頭。政界裏，自然亦應由大人先生做起。如此東一批，西一批，抬起頭來都是穿中國綢的同胞，不上多少時候，便大家喜歡跟着服用了。印度綢考  雪影　　印度綢的名稱，不曉起自何時？凡是上海的士女，都會懂得這個名辭，而相沿没有改變，現在，在上海幾家印度店的生意，聽說還是很不錯··但究其實，他們的絲綢，多數是採取自我國的湖杭二州，何嘗是從印度運來？他們所謂ＣｒａｐｅｄｅＣｈｉｎｅ，亦出我們所呌··「印度綢」，ＣｒａｐｅｄｅＣｈｉｎｅ一名，考係譯自法文，Ｃｒａｐｅ，是縐的意思，ｄｅＣｈｉｎｅ卽中國的意思，明明是說中國的縐。業此項中人，則稱爲璧縐，於此可知並没印度的意義含在！聰明不過的印度人，他們利用了我們中國人素愛外國貨的心理，用了印度的招牌，以廣招徠，實行俗諺說的··「用你們的土，築你們的牆」而從中討到好處；以前的印花絲綢，印花的工程，大都由日本人操縱着，自九一八後，己由許多國産廠繼起効勞，這也是我們中國近年來進步的可喜！　　新近湖杭兩州，出了兩件可與幾十年來外國盛行的外貨相頡頏的品質，値得在這襄介紹一下；杭州近來織出一種極精細的絲質，旣柔

<p>自由談詩和預言  虞明　　預言總是詩，而詩人大半是預言家。然而預言不過詩而巳，詩却往往比預言還靈。　　例如辛亥革命的時候，忽然發現了··　　「手執鋼刀九十九，殺盡胡兒方罷手」。　　這幾句推背圖裏的預言，就不過是「詩」罷了。那時候，何嘗只有九十九把鋼刀？還是洋槍大砲來得厲言··該着洋槍大砲的後來畢竟佔了上風，而只有鋼刀的却吃了大虧。况且當時的「胡兒」，不但並未「殺盡」，而且還受了優待，以至於現在還有「僞」溥儀出風頭的日子。所以當做預言看，這幾句歌訣其實並没有應騐。丨死板的照着這類預言支幹，住往要碰璧，好比前些時候，有人特别打了九十九把鋼刀，去送給前綫的戰士，結果，只不過在古北口等處流流血，給人證明國難的不可抗性。丨倒不如把這種預言歌訣當做「詩」看·還可以「以意逆志，自謂得之」。　　至於詩裏面，却的確有極深刻的預言。我們要找預言，與其讀推背圖，不如讀詩人的詩集。也許這個年頭又是應當發現什麽的時候了罷，居然找着了這麽幾句··　　「此輩封狼從瘈狗，生平獵獸，萬人一怒不可回，會看太白懸其首。」　　一雙照樓詩詞稿··譯　俄之「共和」二年之戰士」。　　這怎麽呌人不「拍案呌絶」呢？這裏「封狼從瘈狗」，自己明明是畜生，却偏把人當做畜生看待··畜生打獵，而人反而被獵！「萬人」的憤怒的確是不可挽回的了。　俄這詩，是說的一七九三年（法國第一共和二年）的帝制黨，他没有料到一百四十年之後還會有這樣的應騐。　　某先生譯這幾首詩的時候，不見得會想到二三十年之後中國己經是白話的世界。現在，懂這種文言詩的人越發少了，這很可惜。然而預言的妙處，正在似懂非懂之間，呌人在事情完全應騐之後，方才「恍然大悟」。這所謂「天機不可可洩漏也。讀經一得  徐懋庸　　今之文武聖賢主張讀經救國，我很贊同。例如孟子，不是十三經之一麽，那裏面就說着這樣的事··　　縢文公問曰··「滕，小國也，竭力以事大國，則不得免焉，如之何則可？」孟子對曰·「昔者，大王居分，狄人侵之。事之以皮幣，不得免焉，事之以犬馬，不得免焉，事之以珠玉，不得免焉，乃屬其耆而告之曰··『狄人之所欲者，吾土地也。吾聞之也，君子不以其所以養人者害人，二三子何患無君，我將去之。』去邠，踰梁山，邑於岐山之下居焉。邠人曰··『仁人也，不可失也，從之者如歸市『。」　　今之百姓，智有如古人之明，心不如古人之厚，故看了九一八以來的陸續失地，一二八以來的往復遷都，不能諒解「君子不以其所養人者害人」之苦心，斤斤於土地之得失，怨謗横生，使仁人痛心，而國事愈不可爲，可謂愚矣！但這該是没有讀過孟子之故。由此觀之，可知經之當讀，而讀經之可以救國也。　　不過，我以爲那些經，也該由敎育部或中央研究院删訂一下。例如上文所引的一段孟子，接着還有幾句道，「或曰，世守也，非身之所能爲也，效死勿去丨君請擇於斯二者。」這未免徒亂人意，宜删。有目的的日記  郁達夫　　偶爾在友人的案頭，看到了册薄薄的什麽座談之類，其中有一篇日記，却是我留學時代的同學某君所作。因爲我自己曾出過一本日記，被人家攻擊得體無完膚，就是到了七八年後的現在，這册日記也還在作各種小報及什麽文壇消息等取笑的材料，所以平時一見到日記之類，就非常注意。　　某先生的那一篇日記，雖只短短一二頁，但他的爲什麽要寫那篇日記，他的目的在那裏，却一看就十分明瞭，明瞭得同小孩子的直率痛快，在墻頭上寫「寫某某眞正不好，可惡可殺，是一隻狗」等匿名揭帖一樣。　　他的第一個目的，是在攻擊某先生的對日本人所發的議論。據這一位先生說來，則日本的無産者羣，是在同情於我們中國的被壓迫的民衆的；但這日記的著者，却完全以爲不對，說日本的無産者，個個都是帮助軍閥，主張侵略中國的讀武主義者，日記中并且還舉出了一位他自己的朋友的話來作證。　　我不幸早出世了幾年，所以當日本來侵的這一二年中間，失去了在日本留學的機會。但以平常遇見的幾位日本朋友的談話，及見到的他們中間所印行的小册子之類看來，則日本民衆的反對政府出兵侵略中國的議論記事，也不祇是一次兩次。所以我覺得日本的無産者羣，完全是他們的軍閥的走狗這一句話，顯見得是過火的議論，是『欲加之罪，何患無詞』的對人的挑剔。　　其次是在日記的末一節裏，忽然說到了債主的將來催逼，以證明他的窮到了無地立錐的境遇。一讀到了這裏，我眞失聲笑出來了。同人之中，我的慣於喊窮喊苦，是大家每用來取笑我的話柄，而獨有這一位日記的著者，却是衆人週知的文人中的富者。正因爲他的理財方法，比我們稍好了一點，所以買我們的嫉視怨恨之處也着實不少。這事情是他也知道，我們也知道，他也知道我們知道的一種公開的秘密。而現在却突如其來的喊出了這一聲窮，這豈不是同『中有黄金三百兩，隔壁王兒不准偷』的告白一樣地可笑麽？天氣怪熟，寫這一點感想，原不過想同這位老同學開開心，妄言多罪，健作爲佳。七月二十一·由「剪竊」事件想起王易敎授  游藝　　王易敎授曾在中央大學的北極齋中慨乎言之。他說··「文辭之事，亦難言哉！」又說··「　近世變孔股，士耽躁進。營目前之務者無論巳。其究心文學者，又苦日力不給，若涉淵海，漫無津涯。重以是非無正，人用其私。桀點者方乞異域之祭餘以驕於國人，····一若中邦　陋，絶無可自存之隙者。結果··「遂使後進徘徊，蕩而不反，卒至冠壯操觚，尚不能自達其意，而浮　　駡之辭氣，則童習之而泄諸楮墨焉，嗚呼！文敝乃至於此！」（以上均見王易所著「修辭學通詮」「識於中央大學之北極齋」的自序）　　王易敎授說的是所謂「乞異域之祭餘以驕於國人，」因與所謂「剪竊」不類，但他所謂「一若中邦謭陋，紀無可自存之隙者，」那樣態度却與所謂「剪竊」者相同。惟不知所謂「方乞異域之祭餘以驕於國人」的「桀黠者」究竟是誰？王易敎授不曾明言，我又始終考不出，到今還是一篇糊塗賬。否則，趁此機會，連同淸算一下也好。　　今天隔壁鄰居ＢＴ君，說起所謂「剪竊」問題，我就用否認的口氣說··「天下事也眞有所謂無的放矢的，像王易敎授的這幾句話好像便是一個例。」當下把王易敎授的話寫給他看。ＢＴ君連忙說「不必寫了，不必寫了，我曉得，我曉得。」我說「這不是無的放矢嗎？」他說「有得很。」我說「的是誰？我終考究不出？」他說「是誰？便是王易自己。」「自己也會把自己本做的的嗎？」我更糊塗了。他說「誰曉得？這就是所謂萬國開棋會，無棋（奇）不有呀！」　　我說「到底是怎麽回事？告訴我，不要專說那丈八和尚，摸不着頭腦的話。」他說「你看過這幾天正在大登廣告的這位王易敎授着的所謂高中參考書「修辭學」没有？那裏有好東西，你該看一看。這本「修辭學通詮」便是那本「修辭學」的改頭换面的東西。那本「修辭學」的頭上，有他自吹自擂的什麽「發前人所未發」的話。」我說「這的什麽關係？眞有好處，略爲表白一下也不是不可恕的。」他說「有關係的很，那就是王易敎授完全乞異域丨日本島村　太郎丨之祭餘的。」我說「不是說，發前人所未發的嗎？想必不過是參考了一下而己。」他說「完全抄的，不過是節抄的，但那節也是節得牛頭不對馬嘴，像余君一樣。」我說「旣抄，爲什麽又說發前人所未發呢？」他說「這就是所謂以驕於國人呀！」　　ＢＴ君說來好像極其有證有據，但我還是懷疑。我到現在，還不知所謂「究心文學者」中間所謂「方乞異域之祭餘以驕於國人」的所謂「桀黠者」是誰？敬將我疑彼信一併寫出，以求敎於該書之著者與讀者。平凡的事（二十）  澹果孫　　「同胞們，那裏去？」　　「陳家浜」。林代表說。　　「就是前面那個陳家浜」？那個兵士指着路西向他問。　　「對的」。　　「那末趕緊走罷！我們剛才接了團部的電說，敝人的飛機這時候正從吳淞方面飛遇來」。　　「飛機！···」好兩個人同聲說。　　「對呀，飛機！同胞們，你們總曉得怎樣躱避罷！千萬不要聚在一塊兒走，更不要亂跑，也不要站着抬頭呆看。」　　他們在致謝之後仍然前進，一面却商妥了分做兩組由不同的路線去達目的的辦法··之光和邱代表一過第七號橋的北堍就轉灣改道向西由小路走，其餘的兩個過了橋仍舊由中山路照固定的路線走。　　之光和邱代表們己經用快步過了那座橋了，這時候，半空中還没有一點兒消息；一逕之光跟着邱代表在轉過灣又走了兩三百步的時候，纔聽見有一陣弱而不斷的嗡嗡之聲，從微風裏蕩過來。之光偷眼向空中望着，一面不住地慢慢步而行；然而却不能發現甚麽····漸漸地，那陣嗡嗡之聲不僅洪大起來，並且還顯出那是帶有震動性的····　　不曉得服從了甚麽力量的指揮，之光和那邱代表竟都立在一片麥田邊，轉身抬頭對住東北兩方的天空找了一會，末了那邱代表纔指着正東說··　　一在那襄！看見了嗎？····一共是六架。　　之光依着邱代表的手指做了一根延長線望過去，慢慢地纔在東面的灰色雲端襄，辨出幾點顏色略爲濃厚向南推進的東西。這時候，他的態度，似乎是很閑睱的了，他除下自己那副眼鏡，就從衣袋裏面取出了一條手帕來拿眼鏡擦了一回，然後再架在鼻梁上去望。他終於看明了那些東西果然是六架飛機，分作兩組前後跟着飛；這樣一來，他的聽官所受的影響彷彿也隨着他的視官所受的，同時對他增加了力量··他不僅聽明白那陣嗡嗡之聲帶有震動性，並且又聽明白震動性之外還帶有磨擦性。　　自從這十多天以來，凡是住在上海的人，對於敵人飛機的種種印象都巳有相當的認識了，之光當然不在例外，不過，之光以前僅僅從成排的房子的縫兒裏張望過，現在竟是在曠野裏遠矚了，以前只在租界上張望過，現在竟是在戰線後面遠矚了！所以以前，他的心情，還憎恨多恐懼少，現在，憎恨與恐懼平衡了。也許「恐懼」，這兩個字在他似乎認爲過於抽象羆，確切一點不如說是恐怖，因爲也許不到三五分鐘，那些飛的東西就可以在他跟前造出一個具體的災禍。　　他終於被那邱代表拉着走了，低着頭，一個字不響，一聲氣不吐··後來邱代表問··　　　　「張先生，究竟要用甚麽才可以抵當飛機，打他們的飛機？」　　「至少，我們也得用飛機；這是不用說的！没有便宜可討的！」　　「唔！····」邱代表說。　　「還要我們也像他們一樣會用····」　　「要一樣會用！」　　「更要我們也像他們一樣肯用····」　　「要一樣肯用····所以就是····要有····要會·····更要肯·····」　　「對的！」</p>

<p>安樂窩生活專號三業餘漫談正確的人生觀  樸　　在上兩期漫談裏曾提出什麽是「人生的眞快樂與進化與創造的生活」兩個問題來加以分析，今天要計論的是何謂正確的人生觀。　　人生觀三個字，通俗一點說，就是人生的態度，也也可說是做人的態度。比如說··一個人對别的個人的態度，或家庭態度，或整個社會人類的態度，合併起來，就是這個人的一個整個的人生觀。我們覺得在這個社會裏，人的一般人生觀，往往只知有「我」而不知有「人」，更有知有什麽「社會」了。這種唯我的人生觀念，尤以一班普通享受着安樂窩生活者與希望過種生活的人爲最甚！他們祗注意自己的利益，而很少顧念他人或多數人的痛苦。他們是最缺少同情心的感覺，但同時他們也是最喜歡責備别人的自私自利而缺少同情心的批評者。他們是不勞動者，但他們却要責備勞動者的不勤勞。他們是不生産者，但他們却是享受最好的産物者。他們不獨是阻礙進化與創造者，他們更是最有力的壓迫從事有關於進化與創造工作的人！這種「個人主義」的人生態度，在今日的中國社會裏，尤佔着絶大的勢力，遂造成中國目前的特殊現狀。所以我們莫要小覷這個小而至於關係一個人的人生觀，要知道要收復東北，洗雪一切的國恥，喚醒這老大的中華國魂，必應先從此點注意起。　　孫中山先生在建國大綱實行三民主義的方略裏，首重一般國民的「心理建設」，中山先生固老早就看透這一點了。「心理建設」的宗旨，就是在改變大多數國人的唯我的人生觀而爲革命的人生觀，或正確的人生觀。這種人生觀的立塲，就是以整個社會爲中心，來代替以個人爲中心的人生態度。我們知道個人是决不能離社會而生存的，人是整個社會環境的産物，我們個人一切思想行動實際上無不是歷來社會發展的結晶品。在原始時代，人類就是在互助的原則上去抵抗自然界與猛獸的壓迫，社會就是在這個原則上而組織成功，後來因爲社會上人與人的關係日趨複雜了，少數人受了自私慾的引誘，以個人的享用爲出發點來支配由共同努力而得來的社會生産，忘却原來互助社會的本來面目，積習相沿，而造成今日這種自相殘殺的現狀若再繼續下去而不急圖改變，則將來必小至一個國家的崩潰，大至整個世界文化的毁滅，我們只要看過去歐戰的損失，就是一個有力的例證。我們要挽救這個危機，先决的條件，就是要有以服務社會爲中心的革命人生觀，本着這種革命的精神，從事於改造在個人主義下一切社會制度的弊端，若如此的人生態度不確立，則必不足以談改革任何社會的問題。倘若一個自命爲改造社會的革命集團，牠裏面的黨員是充滿了以個人主義爲中心的份子；充滿了希望或己實際享受着安樂窩生活的人物，那麽這個集團就根本立於反革命的地位，在不久的將來，就要見棄於全國大多數的羣衆，而失去了牠原有的領導地位，這又是從歷史的事實上所昭示給我們的一個不變的公式，而非任何强暴的方法所得而摧殘或推翻的一個定律。　　某局長的弟弟很得意地對人說··「我飯後定要摸摸女人屁股，揑揑女人奶奶，抽」幾筒大烟，睡一覺，醒來再抽幾筒大烟，精神才會好。所以「新東方」我開個長房間的，包的那一個姑娘很不差，烟燒得很香鬆，價錢並不大，我給她三百塊錢一月，她己感激到極點了！」  飛躍生活準父親  葉瑛玉富家娶妻　　結婚的前一天是頂麻煩的，因爲要洗澡，把身上洗得很乾凈後，要穿上新衣裳，從汗衣到長袍大褂，甚至鞋，襪，帽都是新的。接着，比他有過娶老婆經騐的哥哥或者旁的親人，便喊了他到一個冷靜的地方，給他敎授一些洞房秘訣，使他能夠直達「開封」去！夜靜的三更天，父親又給他「上字」，上字云者，就是另起一名，把它用紅紙寫上，掛到祖先的木神主前。他這樣便呌成人了，雖然他還不夠十五歲，從此，他頭上就頂起準父親的資格。　　第二天一早，許多親戚，朋友來賀喜，一聞門外轟轟鏗鏗的鑼鼓聲，便抖擻精神去和那些來賓對着碰頭丨丨　三叫！　　筆直樣站在客堂前候着，可累人也下午二點鐘的時候，入席了，大家興高采烈地痛飲着，新郎還一席一席地走去勸飲呢！　　他家的親戚朋友眞多，男席有六十多桌，女的也有十幾桌。怪怪，這筆欵</p>

<p>子己不少了，這樣地最少也要宴三天！我不懂他們爲什麽這樣蠢，許多錢這樣的花去！　　席散後，便是花轎起程的時候了！那些儀仗眞多，什麽嚮糖囉（用糖和石膏凝結而疊起的一座寳塔，很高很高的），冰糖山囉，金錢麒麟囉（用許多的光緒錢，貼了金箔而紥成的麒麟），四季的女褂囉，金手鐲，玉如意，珠花等等珍貴的迎親的禮物都各放在一座彩亭中，送到女家去。紙泡砰····砰···砰的爆燒着，釵釘，釵釘的音樂敲着，二百左右的人伕便扛起那些儀仗去「索老婆」　　等到夜深，新娘被花轎抬來了，便拜了天神，祖先，然後去踢轎　，於是娘姨把「赤化」（混身穿着紅的）的新娘，陪到新房去，新郎把頭巾扯去，就在床前飲合　酒咧！　　於是親戚，朋友夜宴了，夜宴過後，便是鬧新房了！鬧了一陣，便把新郎新娘關起來，他們伏在瓦蓋的天窗來窺聽，看看新人們怎樣的行動。　　這個扯一扯，那個躱一躱，話是不打的，雖然他學了一口油滑嘴，她總是不理，顯也她的閨範深嚴！這樣一直鬧到天亮。　　雖然，他滿望直達「開封」，怎知··「行不得也哥哥」！我們社會是講面子哲學的，雖未證實她是處女，可是「這樣人家，女的又有這麽烈性，燒豬就是送去也不要緊！她斷不至會····」　　上午，新娘必須做完「行門」的規矩··去拜祖祠，到各房「期功强近之親」的家裏拜祖先！做過了這一套，回來，便登堂拜翁姑，晚上，一切來賓也循例拜拜。這樣一來，可倒霉了，因爲頭上頂着一頂鳳冠是很重的！頭腦都會被它壓破。可是不要緊，這樣要換取許多的「利是」（利是云者是用紅紙包了一定數量的紙幣成全　的禮品）玩完這一　以後那些來賓想出許多鬼怪的游戲，要新郎和新婦一塊兒鬧，鬧不來，就要罰新娘拿出許許多多的食品來，給他們咀嚼！　　第三天，老婆「歸寗」了，新郎也跟着去拜見岳父岳母，受那些姊妹偷窺，品評。一些聞與不聞之間的言詞，會使他面紅耳熱。過了這座難關，娶老婆也就功德完滿了！　　前途就是「不孝有三，無後爲大」地生兒子！自我職業介紹回音　　露綠湘君··請向下列各處面洽··（一）南京路大陸商塲五樓五五二號楊春申君及（二）閘北海寗路天保里四十九號舒海濤君。（本刋啟）　　張華嫣，景俠，楚，諸女士··請於每日上午惠臨愛文義路六二六號與鄙人接洽。（許浩生啟）　　李女士··敝處現擬聘請家庭敎師一位，如願就，請卽惠臨四川路四一號卜内門洋行營業部與鄙人接洽。（曹隱雲啟）蛋家仔  韋道生　　富家産子　　蛋家仔雖是蛋户人家的兒子，但是「他的八字生得正」，是一個幸運兒，從母親的肚子生了下來，就齊天大聖翻身一變樣變成了百萬家財的富翁的獨子。　　富翁曾做了兩任頂肥的缺的官兒，腦滿腸肥地回到家鄉Ｓ縣後，因爲他闊了，姪兒輩都很殷　地如父母般尊敬他。這時，他己四十多歲了，還没有兒子呢！　　他冷眼就明白這是什麽二回事，無意中告訴了老婆，也許他也想嘗小老婆的滋味的。不過老婆的雌威是了不可當的。他聰明嗎？俗語說得好··「道高一尺，魔高一丈，一他的老婆比他還要聰明呢！她一面不願丈夫娶妾，一面又怕人說她是妬婦，給她一個斬了後嗣的罪名。　　她的確工心計，她用筲箕蓋棉花地把肚子一天一天的裝大起來，然後，差遣她的心腹，到那些窮人家，瞧瞧有什麽適合的貨身没有。卒之，在天妃廟前一隻蛋家艇中找着了，講明出再百塊錢的代價。　　蛋家的兒子生出來後，便在黄昏時候，用竹籃載着，從後門送去！　　呱，呱，呱！富翁生了兒子了，這是多麽大的喜事呢！自己的財産有了保障，用不着那些姪兒門覬觎了，他眞笑到眼睛也瞇起來呢！　　於是鷄蛋一擔一擔的挑進富翁家裏來，於是使Ｓ縣城的蛋和薑幾天内發生恐慌。人們眞倒霉，爲了一個蛋家仔，要吃貴鷄蛋了，因爲那幾天鷄蛋漲了幾文錢的價呢！　　奴婢，僕婦鬧得幾天不能安睡，開夜工染紅鷄蛋和括薑皮。　　豬脚醋的香味薫得滿屋是酸氣，因爲「住月婆一（産後一月内的婦人呌做住月婆）需要這來　　。她到底樂得受用，每天老　她吃其五更的鸂飯，Ｓ縣正堂咧，恊臺咧，城守咧，守備咧，這些官兒的頭鑼執一，鉼　地響着。富翁的宅前，熱鬧極子，引得許多看熱鬧的人，在那裏前前後後的圍着看呢！有財有勢，父母官都去道喜，誰不艷羨呢！　　「鑑江第一樓」的廚師急得屁放尿流地在製菜，一點一點的汗珠滴到那些魚翅，紅燒鮑魚裏面，官兒們，大約也飽嘗異味了吧！　　那位蛋家婆不知爲的什麽，要到富翁家裏去。她這麽襤褸，守門的壯丁當然不許她進去，遂至弄得吵起來！　　於是這回事便拆穿了！　　「原來是一個蛋家仔」，「嘴多」的人帶着滑稽的口吻不禁這樣說。　　後來鬧到裏面都知道了，於是富翁老婆的親信，便走來把她喊了進去，這才算是息了事！燒豬八十隻  查克猛　　富家嫁女　　她十四五歲的時候，她的父母便這樣說··「阿妹年紀大了，替她開年生（就是把女的出生日，送到男處配合配合，看看有什麽相尅之處没有）吧，於是「户限爲穿」地媒人婆走來走去！　　寳林寺的觀音誕那一天，是約定「相睇」的日子，母親瞞着女兒（因爲怕她害羞，會自尋短見），托辭拜觀音，就領她到寳林寺去。　　那位「要睇老婆的男子」，在大雄寳殿前立着。媒人婆鬼鬼祟祟的站在他不</p>
<p>遠的地方，用「眼色」告訴他··「哪，就是　　　娘了。」他整　精神都運在眼中，呆呆地把她從頭到脚看了一遍，看完了貨身，便是講價錢了！　　媒人婆給他家告訴··「女家要八十架食箱」（一架食箱載着四個饌盒，每饌盒可載十斤至十二斤的餅食）後，又說她家會怎樣鬧排塲的「辦嫁妝」，同時舉她家曾嫁去的姑，姊作例子，使他們確信。　　「竹門對竹門，木門對木門」，他們把嫁妝與餅盒放上天秤樣衡量一下，秤秤對得起了，便「過文定」，「過大禮」咧！　　「三書六禮」己完備，只等擇定吉日，「壓女落床萬事勝」咧（女的出嫁前數日，便被囚在房中，一班姊妹圍着，團在床上，哭起來，嘆四句）。遠房近親，整夜送杏仁茶來，給她問候，請她不要哭傷了神！　　這個時候，她是「快過門」了的，於是雙副嫁妝便送到「男家」去，這些嫁妝一個鐘頭也没有把大街走完，這是多麽闊綽的呵！　　祗是被窩，也有好幾十張，春，夏，秋，冬四季的都有，我們這裏不能爲她重抄一遍嫁妝單，故從略。　　姊妹們怕她被丈夫採去她的貞潔（我們家鄉，有姊妹團的秘密組織，大約是六七個姊妹組成的。她們相約，必須姊妹們都一齊出嫁了，才能與丈夫發生性的關係，如果有一個未嫁，也得相與保持貞潔等待她。因此常有不落家的陋習，以常住在母家爲榮，除了過年，過節，或者有什麽婚姻喪葬，才到男家住個兩三天，但仍拒絶丈夫的性交，丈夫也不管她，因爲他巳討了小老婆），給她用絲密密地織一個網兒，把下身保護着，等到「三朝回門」的時候，要受大家的檢閱。她便這樣自動或被動地貞潔呢！　　到了出嫁那一天，花轎到了門前，必須等到夜深才放她去，姊妹們還會把轎簾藏起　去敲男家一大筆竹槓呢！　　出嫁後，姊妹還是不散的，她們等着她回來！她們雖然是禁止她們的姊妹與丈夫性交，可是「燒豬肉」還是要吃的（燒豬，大約嫁後第二天，男家便把它送到女家來，證明他們的女兒是一個處女）！　　她一共獲得八十隻燒豬（因爲她的代價有過八十架食箱，每架食箱要一燒奢壓禮）！　　這是我們家鄉的闊人嫁女的一幕。食客萬人  王謝燕　　富家開弔　　平常在報紙的正封面上，總是一些商店的大廣告，然而那天眞有一些特别，在封面上發見了一個這樣的大啓事··「ＸＸＸ，ＸＸＸ，······等爲Ｘ州Ｘ公ＸＸ宗祠曁Ｘ母Ｘ太夫人公祭啓事····Ｘ公久居海上，現在原籍Ｘ州，重修祠廟，業己完工。·····Ｘ母Ｘ太夫人······去世巳整十週，·····今定於七月十日至二十四日舉行Ｘ氏宗祠落成典禮，·······同時並爲Ｘ母Ｘ太夫人正式開弔設奠。····Ｘ公不願驚動親友，乃鄙人等誼屬同鄉······。然親友如賜隆儀，請即折賜現金，以便移助ＸＸ小學，······共哀盛舉，·····」　　ＸＸＸ等十幾位Ｘ公同鄉都是滬上著名偉人（？），不是巨商遺老，便是政客大享。當然，Ｘ公也是一位偉人，他最近曾改建「Ｘ州旅滬同鄉會」，並在Ｘ州原籍，重修宗譜，招集族人，加入者達三千口之多！對於這麽一位大亨，誰不希望去討個好？况身臨盛典，也許可以多認識些名人，於是，「十日往Ｘ州去嗎？」就成了上海社會間的一個重要問題。　　九日的晚上，許多商店，公司和機關，都收到了Ｘ州旅滬同鄉會的一封公函，代各該處職員告假兩星期。當然，各該處只好照准。不過，這麽一來，一般旅滬的Ｘ州人，除去不夠資格的以外，就此一網打盡，上海地方上暫時一個也不留了。　　九日夜半三點鐘，北站開出專車三列，載了　　成萬的Ｘ州同鄉向西駛去　　汽車在Ｘ州是没有的。在四時左右，Ｘ公派了二十多位招待員在站台上立着。凡與Ｘ公確有交情的人丨丨一面之交也算在内丨丨都乘着馬車，其餘的人也祗好坐着黄包車，一字的向Ｘ氏宗祠進行。但因車少人多之故，所以當這邊車站上還有不少人在找車子的時候，前隊早己在宗祠的大廳裏進茗用點心了。　　一大批車錢由帳房支付以後，南京來的專車和杭，嘉，湖等處來的火輪也在七點鐘左右完全開到。Ｘ氏宗祠裏是少長咸集，各色的人都有。幸而這座祠廟佔地有四十餘畝之廣，除了花園和神主堂以外，大廳有六進十二廂，尚不至有人滿之患。從上午十一點鐘起，各廳擺膳，一共開了十多批，而每批又都在一百桌以上，這種盛會在Ｘ州是千年少有的！　　上燈時候，主人請招待員拿出從上海帶去的「沙利文洋點心」饗客。等到晚餐以後，凡Ｘ州有住所的都回去了，有些人便住在旅館裏，而每一旅館也就都掛了客滿牌，祗有一部份Ｘ公的近親契友是被留住在四個小四合跨院裏，而那和中山陵一樣的純粹東方式巨厦也在黑暗中埋没了下去。　　一天，兩天，····一直到二十一日，一切環境都没有什麽兩樣，祇有Ｘ州市塲上的菜價是比平日漲了三倍多，有些菜品，即使出了重價也没處買，使一般中等以下的住户都呌苦連天，一時怨聲爲之載道。　　二十二日淸晨，在大花園的假山後面亭子旁邊多了一座舞臺和三千多個的座位，祠堂各方出入口也己換了新的鮮花彩牌樓。　　客人漸漸多了，各處聞人也到了。正廳上擺滿了金盾和金杯。據說仍有不少送禮的人没有「折賜現金」，但是許多瑣碎的禮物無處陳列，所以，除了眞緞幛和名人對條以外，祗能擺上百多件金器，而銀器却被打扁了放在木箱裏。　　隆重的大典由Ｘ部長行了落成禮。誦讀了幾篇歌功頌德的祭文以後，大家又忙忙碌碌的不知作了些什麽事，不過這天的來賓是分了階級的，凡没有某種資格的人，都不能隨意行動了。　　夜裏堂會是由北平上海兩處請來的，其節目有平劇，灘簧，滑稽，以及Ｘ州本地的宣卷，内中當然以平劇爲最出色，因爲有Ｘ博士在這裏表演「雄女人」呢！　　二十四日下午三點鐘，再上一次祭，還由北平請了四十九位啦嘛僧來，誦了一日一夜的番經，堂會的節目是比前兩夜更有精彩了。　　二十五日從Ｘ州開出五列專車和四隻包定的火輪，把成千成萬的食客送回來處。　　Ｘ公看賬時候，知道收禮現金有二十萬，但開支却達八十萬之多。當然，那不足數的六十萬由Ｘ公自己付了，不過，六十萬買一個「Ｘ州第一富翁」和「上海巨頭之一」的名譽是很便宜的，同時還被人稱讚一句「孝子賢孫」！　　不過，Ｘ公到底是一位大慈善家，因爲事後很慷慨地拿出了私欵一萬四千七百三十二元（零數容易呌人明白這是由小數集成的禮金）捐給ＸＸ小學。在登載「ＸＸＸ······爲Ｘ公·····啓事」的一個月以後，我們在報紙的背封面又可以找到了一篇「ＸＸ小學　謝　ＸＸ　　　　　　　　　文章本刋特别啟事　　本刋下期仍係「安樂窩生活專號」，惟特别注重於富人所常涉足之大飯店，大戲院，俱樂部，上等人肉市塲以及其他娛樂塲所之生活，希各界文友，踴躍賜稿，無任企盼！報酬從豐。社會解剖室資本主義經濟危機的解剖  魯庸　　資本主義的經濟危機，自從一九二九年五六月間農产品與原料價格暴跌·十月紐約交易所證劵暴落開始，直到現在巳繼續四五年之久，仍未有减弱的趨勢，反而在那裏日益擴大與深刻化。這一危機的持續，在資本主義的發展史上，可以說是空前未有的形　，而將成爲資本主義的致命傷了。所以目前的世界經濟會議，只是資本主義的最後掙扎，無疑的，對於這一危機不會得到若何的解决。何况各國在會議之前，各懷異見，對於戰債，貨幣，關稅，市塲等問題，都限於自身的利害，互不相讓，會議勢必擱淺或不議而散，而成爲過去一般會議的通病。　　但這個危機的基本原因，可以分爲經濟的與政治的二種。經濟的原因乃是由於一九二二丨二九年的産業擴張，工業技術的可驚的進步，以及生産品數量的異常增加。但在此工業擴張時期，工業品的價格並不如生産成本减低得那樣快，且生活程度的後年增高與生産設置的迅速進步，使千百萬的勞動者羣被生産過程所投閒置散（産業合理化運動），更加重了生産過剩與消費不足之間的不平衡。至於政治的原因，我們可以舉出下列五種··（一）歐洲的巴爾幹化。蓋凡爾賽和約爲要使法國取得歐洲大陸的霸權，必須陷歐洲於分崩離析，然後才能支配各小國，使牠們無倫在財政上或政治上都要倚賴法國，因之各國遂形成了生産力衰退與消費力减弱的現象。（二）賠欵與戰債。歐洲各國所欠美國的債務達一百二十萬元，這些債務的償還，英，法，意，比，等國政府都盡力想使　出之於德國的賠欵，所以賠欵與戰債使世界百分之六十以上的黄金集中於法美二國，失去了流通商品的作用。（三）關稅保護主義。關稅保護本是落後國家爲了增加生産而抵制先進國家侵略的一種最重要的武器。但在現今世界經濟正走入國際分工的時代，各國間關稅壁壘的增高，在在足以阻塞商品的流通，妨害工商業的發展，而使各國對外貿易减少。（四）軍備競爭。爲了軍備競爭，各國政府不得不加重課稅，因此使軍費在國民經濟中成了極重大的負担，但各國政府都不惜裁員减薪，减少失業救濟金，以增加軍費。（五）蘇聯五年計劃的成功。蘇聯五年計劃的四年成功，穩固了社會主義建設的基礎，給與資本主義一個極大的打擊，且第二次五年計劃又巳開始，更將加緊促進資本主義的崩潰，於是資本主義與社會主義制度間的衝突，使歐美各國拒絶與蘇聯合作，拒絶對蘇聯作大規模的賒貨，而各國的失業問題遂亦愈益嚴重。　　危機的基本的經濟與政治諸原因旣如上述，現在，我們且更進一步的看各國的統治階級如何着手去解决這一危機。　　自然，他們不會有什麽澈底的政策，因爲資本主義的統治只在少數人的利益，而不顧及大多數人的利益的。所以危機的起源，雖然由於生産過剩與消費不足，但是資本家寗願籍毁滅一部份的出産品（如糖，咖啡，棉花等）來提高價格，而不願藉提高工資，提高工人的購買力以脫離經濟的危機。因之，他們現在所能做到的只在停付戰債與賠欵一年，增高關稅，放棄金本位，加緊對勞苦大衆的壓迫剥削，以及對蘇聯的進攻，尤其是對於最後兩項，他們更表現了瘋狂的醜態。總之，他們所採取的辦法，有的是把危機推到將來，妄想犧牲别國，使自己首先脫離危機的重團；有的只在於對危機作一笨拙的彌縫。但他們有一點是共同的，就是各國資産階級政府的挽救經濟危機，並不企圖提高本國民衆的生活以擴大工商業的市塲，而只想在减輕生産成本的名義下，加緊向工人階級進攻，降低工人和重稅中小資産階級的生活，並將商品的銷售問題移到國外市塲，尤其是殖民地市塲上去，加緊帝國主義間重新瓜分殖民地的爭奪。　　然而危機的總解决，依照上述資本主義的政策，只是一種幻想；這危機必然的要在另一制度展開之下，與資本主義同歸於盡。</p>

<p>Pang Sends Telegrams to Song Requesting the Dispatch of County Magistrates to Receive Control of Chahar</p>
<p>Beiping. Pang Bingxun has repeatedly telegraphed Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun, stating that if there is any hope for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation, he would gladly comply and hopes that the two brothers will proceed with negotiations in Beiping. Song has not responded. It is reported that Qin has already telegraphed Pang, stating that due to Song's circumstances, he cannot express any opinion on the Chahar situation and hopes that he will handle it himself. This afternoon, Song hosted a banquet at his private residence in Wuyiku for Liu Jianqun, Zhang Lisheng, Gao Guizi, Shen Ke, Liu Ruming, Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, and others. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Pang Bingxun telegraphed Song Zheyuan, hoping that county magistrates would be dispatched to Chahar to take over, and sent more than a dozen telegrams detailing everything. Qin Dechun replied on Song's behalf, explaining the difficulties of Song's situation and stating that he could not express any opinion. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. The Pingbao express train on the Ping-Sui Railway, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Beiping at 9:30 yesterday morning, was delayed until 7:30 this morning. It still departed for Baotou at 9:00. According to people from Baotou, the delay was entirely due to congestion and changing locomotives. Moreover, the inspection of passengers was very strict, especially when traveling south of Shacheng. Anyone slightly suspicious would be detained. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Although the situation in Chahar has eased slightly in recent days, it is not a cause for optimism. Sun Liangcheng's troops, a subordinate of Feng (Yuxiang), are stationed only ten miles south of Xuanhua, and are close to Pang Bingxun's forces. Ma Boyuan, who went to Zhangjiakou a few days ago, met with Feng (Yuxiang), Fang Zhenwu, and others after arriving in Zhangjiakou. Feng and others expressed that as long as the government has a comprehensive plan for resisting Japan, everything will be resolved. In addition, they also stated that their guns would never be pointed inward, etc. Ma returned to Beiping from Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 22nd and immediately reported the trip to Huang Fu. Ma was originally scheduled to go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek but has now decided to postpone it temporarily. It is reported that the authorities believe that Feng's spirit of resisting Japan is no different from that of the central government and still hope that Feng can have a final realization so that the Chahar situation can be resolved peacefully. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Feng (Yuxiang) is collecting more than ten thousand yuan in Zhangjiakou every day. The heads of public security bureaus in each county also serve as commanders of the self-defense army. Those with 200 guns are appointed as division commanders, and those with 100 guns are appointed as brigade commanders. Therefore, there are quite a few division and brigade commanders in Chahar.

<p>Sun Himself Also Arrives in Baotou</p>
<p>Beiping. Sun Dianying's army of 20,000 has arrived in the Baotou area and is stationed in military sheds along the west bank of the river. The area is still peaceful. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Sun Dianying's troops in the Chaigoubao area are gradually moving towards Baotou. According to a telegram yesterday, it is expected to be completed in about a week. It is reported that Sun himself has arrived in Baotou. The Sun army gathered in Baotou has reached more than 20,000 people. More than 30,000 people remain west of Chaigoubao, and a portion are marching on foot. Sun's army has previously received the fourth installment of pay and provisions for July and August, but the estimated cost of provisions and transportation facilities along the way to Qinghai is about one million yuan. They have now sent personnel to the Military Affairs Commission to request the continued issuance of the fifth and sixth installments of subsidies, each totaling 130,000 yuan, and 110,000 yuan for September provisions, for a total of 370,000 yuan. The shortfall will be presented to the central government for funds to be raised. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports that all of Sun Dianying's troops have passed Zhangjiakou and are heading west. There are still three brigades waiting for transportation in Chaigoubao to go west. Since Feng's army destroyed the bridge near Nanxinzhuangzi Station in Xuanhua on the 18th, Sun quickly ordered his troops to leave to avoid suspicion. On the evening of the 20th, Sun and He Sui traveled from Chaigoubao to Baotou, passing Yanggao at midnight, where they met and talked with Li Fuying for a long time. After Sun's troops leave for the west, he will be appointed Chairman of Xinjiang, and there is also talk of appointing Yue Xiangru as cavalry army commander. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Xie Gangzhe to Act as Fleet Commander</p>
<p>Jinan. Han Fuju said that he had just received a telegram from Shen Honglie stating that he could return to Qingdao tonight. He has telegraphed Chiang, Wang, He, and Huang, as well as Chiang Bo-cheng, to report that this matter can be considered settled. Furthermore, at 8:00 this morning, Shen passed through Zhifu from Yantai. Representatives from Qingdao welcoming him arrived in Weihai this afternoon to await Shen. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan. Shen Honglie's representative, Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, was previously summoned to Nanchang by Chiang Kai-shek via telegram. Today, he is passing through Jinan on his way back to Qingdao. According to reports, Chiang praised Shen for his military administration and political governance and consistently refused to accept his resignation as commander and mayor. He also said that although Shen has suffered some stimulation, he can endure it for the time being. When the Naval Department submitted a request to approve Shen's resignation as commander, Chiang was at the front and only learned about it afterward. After the Executive Yuan issued a clear order to retain him, Shen no longer resigned as mayor.

However, the Japanese authorities replied that the position occupied by Dolon is important for the peace and order of Rehe, and if necessary, the Japanese-Manchukuo forces would have to take self-defense actions, which is not inconsistent with the Tanggu Truce. Currently, in order to avoid conflict with the Japanese-Manchukuo forces, Feng has ordered the troops stationed in Dolon to move backward. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Will Go to Jiangxi Soon to Report Everything to Wang and Chiang</p>
<p>Huang Said the Inside Story of Xinjiang is Complicated and Difficult to Explain in Detail</p>
<p>Nanjing. Huang Musong took the Eurasia No. 1 plane from Dihua to Lanzhou on the 21st, and transferred to the Eurasia No. 2 plane to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd, arriving in Nanjing at 5:35 pm, and went to Zhugiao private house to rest. Councilor Wang Yingyu, Staff Officer Gao Changzhu, Yang Bingquan, and Wang Junsheng and others came with him. Huang planned to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang and Wang within a few days, as soon as the reply telegram arrives. According to Huang, as soon as he received the two telegrams from President Wang Zhihan urging him to return, he ended the office business and telegraphed Beijing, requesting a plane to be sent to Xinjiang. The Eurasia Company's No. 1 plane arrived in Dihua at noon on the 20th and arrived in Lanzhou at Shenshi on the 21st, where he met with Gansu Chairman Zhu Shaoliang, and then took the No. 2 plane back to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd. The Xinjiang incident is complicated and cannot be explained in a short time, and there is much to it. It cannot be explained now, let it be described in detail another day. Liu Wenlong, Sheng Shicai entrusted them to bring letters to Chairman Chiang, President Wang and the chairmans of various departments and the central military and political dignitaries. I will first send a telegram to Jiangxi today, report to Chiang and Wang, and ask for the date of the meeting. Gao Changzhu said that there are nine ethnic groups in the new province, including Han, Hui, Kazakh, and Turbaned, who are extremely supportive of the central government. This time, Huang's envoy went there and expressed welcome. The reasons for the two incidents in Xinjiang can be divided into two: First, Ma Zhongying worried that after Huang's envoy arrived in Xinjiang, he would contact Sheng Liu, which was not good for him, so he sent troops to commit crimes on the border of Di. After Sheng Shicai and others contacted to fight back, they defeated Ma's troops, and killed Ma Zhongying's younger brother Zhongjie in Gucheng. Currently, Ma's troops are stationed in Hami, Turpan, Yanqi and other three places, with a total of more than 2,000 people. As for whether Ma himself was injured, it is impossible to confirm. Second, the local people cherish the rich deposits of the new province, and urgently need to gather talents from all parties to govern. Some advocated organizing a committee to handle all affairs in the new province, and appointed prestigious people as members, with Sheng Shi as the chairman. Sheng was afraid that this would disperse his personal power, so he strongly opposed it. His shooting of Chen Zhongtao, Yue Ming and others was also because Tao and others participated in supporting the organization committee. The new province is rich in products and can be developed. I hope that the central government will have a thorough plan for Xinjiang in the future, so that the country and local areas will benefit. The staff in our territory have all left the country. There are still Zhang Cheng and Sha and other three people left in Lanzhou, and they will also arrive on Monday next week. Huang is planning to go to Xun Ming to meet Chiang and Wang and report the details of the experience. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) According to a report from the Consul stationed in Chita, 20 Red Army reconnaissance planes departed in formation eastward on the 13th. Their destination appears to be Da Wuliya. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 14th, the Red Army opened eight military trains, each carrying 29 tanks, four trucks, and two battalions of infantry, to Da Wuliya, ostensibly to participate in field exercises being held in Outer Mongolia, but they will remain in the area after the exercises are over.

<p>(Tokyo) Manzhouli telegrams state that Soviet Russian troops are concentrated at stations east of Chita and are now constructing fortifications, and that Soviet Russia and the puppet state are about to go to war. Regarding this news, the Army stated that it has not yet received any official telegram and therefore finds it difficult to believe. Currently, there is also the issue of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the puppet state's defense ships are entering and exiting the Heilongjiang River, which the Russian side has already acknowledged. While Soviet Russia is taking a pro-Manchukuo policy, the possibility of conflicts between Russia and Manchukuo is deeply believed to be impossible.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to propose three points as Japan's hope, requiring both parties to consider, depending on how the sixth negotiation goes: (1) The Japanese side hopes that representatives from both sides will directly negotiate to break the deadlock in the negotiations, without actively mediating; (2) If the opinions of Russia and Manchukuo still have a large discrepancy, it would be futile to continue formal discussions. It is proposed to take a one-month break from formal discussions during the summer, and then discuss again in September when a considerable degree of preparation for the possibility of negotiation can be made; (3) During the summer recess, the secretaries-general of both parties should continue private consultations to seek mutual contact.

<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Arakawa made the following statement to reporters today: The government's budget for the next year, the new demands of the army, navy, and other provinces will certainly reach a huge number. Therefore, all parties are concerned about the source of funds. However, the amount of the budget does not need to be emphasized. It is necessary to judge the policy based on the overseas situation and domestic trends, and determine the budget of each province. The purpose of establishing the Traffic Conference this time is to change certain malpractices. However, the government's lack of financial resources is a fact. The Ministry of Finance intends to obtain the financial resources for the next year's budget only by issuing public bonds, which is too reckless. The issue of abolishing extraterritorial rights and recovering affiliated territories has arisen in "Manchukuo." However, this is not only for "Manchukuo," but also Japan's principle of abolishing extraterritorial rights in China. However, "Manchukuo" has not been established for long and has not yet reached the stage of concrete consideration. The issue of the permanent stationing of the Kwantung Army will be implemented starting from the year after next. It has not yet been decided whether the dispatched officers should be permanent or alternating. Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) sale conference, the Russian side has submitted the first proposal, and the second and third proposals have not yet been submitted. Japan will decide its countermeasures depending on the future situation. The issue of the Cabinet setting up a minister without portfolio is the Prime Minister's plan and I do not know its contents.

<p>(Guangzhou) Huangpu, since the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, has leapt to fame and become a famous place. Recently, there is a very old primary school student in that area, whose age must be the oldest among primary school students in the world. She is a woman named Lai Zhangshi (transliteration), currently 63 years old. Her husband and son are both abroad and often send letters home, but Lai currently does not recognize characters and cannot read them, let alone understand their meaning, which she deeply regrets. Therefore, after the opening of the village summer school this summer, she enrolled in the school. The school authorities, recognizing her eagerness to learn, strongly assist her in reading everyday usage and letter writing in Chinese, so that she can apply it as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e32">Both "Cultivating Righteousness" and "Establishing Confidence" are Important <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, during the inauguration ceremony of the new Hubei Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang, Zhang Qun and others, Jiang Zuobin, the central supervisor representative, gave instructions, saying, "The Hubei Provincial Committee should cultivate righteousness, embrace the heart of 'feeling hungry when others are hungry, feeling drowned when others are drowning,' and ensure that no one is left without a place." Huang Shaoxiong, the representative of the Executive Yuan, also said, "It is necessary to establish confidence so that the people believe in the government." The phrase "cultivating righteousness" can be said to be a unique insight from Jiang, while "establishing confidence" is a particularly relevant observation of the current situation. If the Hubei Provincial Committee can truly understand and strive to achieve this, then the thoughts of lofty virtue will genuinely cause us ordinary people to look forward to and pray for it day and night.</p>
<p>Since experiencing years of war, the rural society in our country has long been showing signs of collapse. Coupled with the heavy burden of national taxes and the onerous demands of local levies, the people's livelihoods have been exhausted to the extreme. They look forward to a wise and virtuous government to relieve them from their inverted situation every day. However, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been bearing the aftermath of destruction and existing in a state of bewilderment. All situations are in a state of turmoil and instability. Ethical principles have been destroyed, human nature has been dispersed, morality has been undermined, and justice has been suppressed. Like a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a pond in the middle of the night, it is a dangerous situation. Why wait for in-depth discussion? This is indeed a fact that the people of the whole country are deeply concerned about and fear, and it cannot be concealed by clever words and elaborate rhetoric.</p>
<p>The key element of establishing a nation is righteousness. Precisely because there is no righteousness, corruption is rampant, bribery is openly practiced, and people collude with each other from top to bottom, choosing the fattest morsels to devour. Public funds are transformed into private property, stealing the essence of the nation. Precisely because there is no righteousness, mediocre individuals compete to advance, and deceit and deception are sold together. They despise personality and tarnish their duties, considering flattery as their ability to seek temporary gains. Precisely because there is no righteousness, petty villains run rampant, relying on their power and influence, bullying the villagers. They raise henchmen as knives and cleavers, slaughtering the good and weak like fish and meat. All these social ills are almost everywhere. The weak, without power or courage, have no place to rest or recover under this layer upon layer of exploitation. Unless they are oblivious and lose their conscience, gradually transforming into the path of decadence, they can only endure humiliation and drift in the gutters.</p>
<p>"Cultivating righteousness" means enhancing moral strength. Using moral strength to correct the declining customs and habits must start with those at the top setting an example with their own behavior to ensure effectiveness. Once righteousness is established and supported, all constructions will gradually be implemented. As the saying goes, "What those above prefer, those below will indulge in to an even greater extent." We have never seen a virtuous government that would tolerate the presence of corrupt elements. Representative Jiang used this to encourage the Hubei Provincial Committee. How can the Hubei Provincial Committee not strive to discipline itself? However, there is still something we cannot help but say. Nowadays, so-called important figures often like to engage in fine rhetoric, expounding on matters and making promises with oaths, without thinking about the consequences. The tricks of the monkey trainer are already well understood by the people. Drawing cakes to satisfy hunger and indulging in chewing after passing a butcher shop. We deeply feel that the fondness of the officials for grand words is a disease that is perhaps even worse than not speaking. Because if the officials do not speak, although the current darkness may be deep, there is still hope for a day of clarity. Only when they speak eloquently but act negligibly does it become truly hopeless, further increasing our anxiety. The essence of Representative Huang's "establishing confidence" is merely a transition from Representative Jiang's encouragement. Otherwise, empty words are useless and do not help in reality. Why should we attach importance to these words?</p>
<p>In conclusion, cultivating righteousness cannot be achieved in a single stroke, while establishing confidence relies on facts. By setting up overturned carts to warn those who come after, we have unlimited hope for the Hubei Provincial Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Three Silver-Holding Countries and Six Silver-Producing Countries Sign Four-Year Silver Agreement <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Important Step in Stabilizing Silver</p>
<p>Agreement Stipulates Restrictions on Silver Sales by Signatory Countries</p>
<p>Effective from January 1st Next Year</p>
<p>(London) China, India, Spain, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States, nine countries in total, signed a four-year silver agreement in London today. The signing ceremony was held at the Claridge's Hotel in the residence of the US representative, Mr. Pittman. It was highly confidential beforehand.</p>
<p>This agreement required consideration of the past interests of all related countries, and the attitude of obstruction by European gold standard countries required much persuasion before it could be successfully negotiated. It is stipulated that it will take effect from January 1, 1934. The signatory countries must submit their ratification notices to Washington by April 1st next year.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, India, the country with the largest silver reserves in the world, agrees to sell no more than 140 million ounces of silver within four years, averaging 35 million ounces per year. The Spanish government agrees to sell no more than 5 million ounces per year. The Chinese government promises not to sell the silver obtained from the destruction of silver coins on the market. The agreement also stipulates that if India's silver sales in one year are less than 35 million ounces, the difference can be sold together in the second half of the year, but the total amount sold in one year cannot exceed 50 million ounces.</p>
<p>In return for the three major silver-holding countries restricting their silver sales, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States, the six major silver-producing countries, agree to absorb a fixed amount of silver from their respective silver mines each year and not sell excess silver reserves. The total amount purchased is 35 million ounces per year, which will be stored in the national treasury, used for currency purposes, minted into coins, or used as currency reserves, according to the convenience of each country.</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing represented China in signing the agreement. Afterwards, Yan told reporters that China was very happy about the conclusion of the agreement. We believe that it is a very important action for world progress. China certainly wants the stability of silver prices, and this agreement is an important step towards stabilizing silver prices. (Twenty-second National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Canadian Prime Minister Bennett today denied that Canada had any intention of hindering the Pittman silver bill. At the same time, it was also heard that if the eight-nation silver agreement were submitted today, Canada would not attempt to delay the signing of the first letter. However, it is expected that there will still be points in the re-drafted articles that will be opposed by other countries. The most agreeable obstacle is the unexpected discovery that Spain has 150 million more ounces of silver than originally stated. (Twenty-second National Dispatch)</p>

<p>United States Proposes Suggestion</p>
<p>Hoping to Establish a New Agreement to Eliminate Trade Barriers During the Recess of the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>(London) The US Chief Representative to the World Economic Conference, Secretary of State Hull, submitted the US proposals regarding (1) extending the customs truce, (2) reducing commercial barriers, and (3) most-favored-nation treatment to the Chairman of the Economic Committee, Dutch Prime Minister Colijn. The content roughly states that the countries that have delegates at the Economic Conference</p>
<p>economies can improve. They pledge to establish appropriate methods: (1) either passively, by stopping the erection of new tariff barriers, or (2) actively, by gradually removing existing tariff barriers. (Twenty-first Havas Dispatch) (London) Before the recess, the World Economic Conference will ask the participating countries to sign a new agreement on a customs and trade barrier truce. This matter was proposed by the US Chief Representative Hull, asking the countries to sign this agreement within one month. It will take effect immediately after the countries that accept it represent 50% of the total amount of world international trade, for a period of one year, and can be repealed after the expiry date. However, because its period is as long as one year, major countries may not be able to accept it unconditionally. The content of the proposal states that the United States suggests that during the recess of the conference and during subsequent convocations, progress should be continuously sought on commercial policies. It is appropriate for the countries to agree not to implement new obstacles that directly or indirectly have an adverse impact on the circulation of international commerce, and the proposal stipulates certain exceptions and advocates that countries should conduct bilateral or multilateral agreements during this truce to eliminate restrictions on trade and reduce tariffs. (Twenty-second National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The commercial policy procedures proposed by the US government were announced to the public by Chairman Dr. Colijn at the plenary session of the Economic Committee today. Dr. Colijn stated that in a letter from US Chief Representative Hull, the US policy is to seek the expansion of international trade to the greatest possible extent that does not conflict with the main objectives in the above-mentioned procedures. The United States hopes that relevant countries can propose practical proposals during the recess to achieve the original basic purpose of the conference. Hull also explained the possible forms of agreement for extending the customs truce.</p>

<p>Australian Representative Bruce claimed that much energy was spent at the conference focusing on the issue of restricting production, which he greatly regretted because he believed that the true goal of the conference to raise prices might not be achieved by restricting production. According to Australia's view, the conference has achieved nothing except restricting production or agreeing on a plan to restrict production, which is tantamount to admitting failure.</p>

<p>The general public's opinion that the report of the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference is overly optimistic can be seen from the numerous amendments proposed at today's meeting. British Representative Lindsell proposed changing the phrase "important results have been achieved" in the report on the activities of the Economic Committee to "important progress has been made." There was much discussion among the participants about this event. Chairman Dr. Colijn finally stated that a special drafting committee would be organized to revise the report. When the Economic Committee adjourned, the crowd applauded Chairman Dutch Prime Minister Colijn to show their respect because Dr. Colijn handled his duties with a strong and polite manner. (Twenty-second Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The drafting committee appointed by the Economic Committee of the Economic Conference last night made several formal revisions to the initial draft of the report, intending to delete the theoretical parts of the report that do not match the actual results. After the final revision decision of the report by the drafting committee, it will no longer be submitted to the Economic Committee for discussion, but will be submitted to the representatives who did not attend the drafting committee, so that each representative can have a basis for drafting the final opinion.

As a result of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' consultation, it was decided to support the validity of the resolution from the following viewpoints, namely (1) although there is no objection to the continued validity of the customs truce, the imperial government's reservations also remain valid, (2) If participating countries withdraw from the resolution and take measures that hinder international trade, the imperial government must not only take defensive measures, but also has the freedom to withdraw from the resolution of the truce to resist. The imperial government has already telegraphed this intention to Ishii Plenipotentiary, and can vote in favor of this understanding during the vote. (Twenty-second Electric News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Sino-German Economy Seeks Closer Cooperation</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen arrived safely in the German capital this morning. German government officials and Chinese Minister Liu Wendao and others went to the station to greet him. This afternoon, the German government specially hosted a banquet for Song to wash away the dust. Many key figures from the German military and political circles participated. German Deputy Foreign Minister Meyer represented Foreign Minister Neurath, who was in Munich, and was unable to attend in person. He delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Neurath, which roughly stated that after the recent political reforms in Germany, it has reached a state of unity, and the increase in Sino-German economic relations is of great benefit to both countries. Song rose to deliver a reply speech, which roughly stated that all countries in the world are now suffering from the harm of excessive economic development, while China has the opposite feeling of insufficient economic development. In the future, China's gradual development will not only be beneficial to China itself, but also to all industrial countries in the world. Song also said that Chinese people have always expressed extreme admiration for Germany's industrial achievements, so they deeply hope that Germany can lend a helping hand in China's development history, or that it will also be helpful to the unemployment problem that Germany is currently feeling. Song's consultation on economic matters in Germany will not be conducted solely in Berlin, but also in Hamburg. People here generally believe that there is indeed room for expansion in the economic cooperation between China and Germany, and it is especially fortunate that the feelings between the two countries have never been affected by any adverse factors. The expansion of aviation between Europe and Asia to the Chinese border and Xinjiang and other places in the near future, enabling direct communication between Berlin and Beiping Nanjing and other places, can especially be cited as a true example of Chinese cooperation (Twenty-first National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Revolutionaries Oppose Leaders Changing Policies</p>
<p>Riots Occur in Various Places, the Situation is Very Serious Goring Convenes Meeting to Decide on Severe Punishment</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st - Prussian Prime Minister Goring suddenly ended his vacation and rushed back to Berlin. He is scheduled to convene a meeting tomorrow afternoon with the leaders of the National Socialist Stormtroopers and the National Socialist Special Forces. This decision was taken after a secret meeting of the leaders of the political police and officials from the Ministries of Justice and Interior. Since the change in the policy of the National Socialist Party, the National Socialist Army seems to be deeply dissatisfied, resulting in riots in several cities. The Governor of Plesslau Province in Upper Silesia, Hams, is highly regarded by the communists who have been converted to the National Socialist Party. The party army led by Hams is extremely leftist. Riots broke out in Boden, which were quelled by the intervention of the National Defense Forces. The National Socialist Stormtroopers in the Meineflockfu area were disbanded for propagating socialism. The same happened to the Stormtroopers in Düsseldorf and Essen. The Stormtroopers in Hamburg occupied the headquarters of the National Socialist Party, and many people were arrested. A man named Schpleihue in Pinneberg, who is the leader of the National Socialist Party there, engaged in anti-Semitic movements and disrupted order. The situation was so serious that Prime Minister Hitler had to personally rush to the area. In short, the socialist and revolutionary factions within the National Socialist Party have been brewing this situation because they saw the leaders of the National Socialist Party government change their policies. The situation is very serious and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 22nd - The Prussian Cabinet will meet this morning to discuss the situation. All Prussian police chiefs, chief prosecutors and presidents of the courts of appeal, and leaders of the secret political police have been invited to attend. As for the leaders of the National Socialist Stormtroopers, a special meeting will be held in the afternoon. According to the semi-official Conti News Agency, Prussian Prime Minister Goring believes that in order to maintain internal security and peace, extremely strict new measures must be adopted. The main issue to be discussed at the cabinet meeting is to strengthen the means of suppressing the Communist Party, and the secret police should also step up their work to ensure that all movements of opponents of the National Socialist Party cannot occur. According to the current situation, anyone who undermines the work of the government will be sentenced to death, and the scope of restrictions will be even wider than before. According to the Hürwolf News Agency, foreign news said that the meeting of the Stormtroopers' leaders in Berlin was due to the dissatisfaction of the radical elements of the party caused by the social and economic policies adopted by the National Socialist Party government, especially some Stormtroopers, and that disturbances had occurred in various places due to dissatisfaction with the government's policies. This news is completely unbelievable. The purpose of today's cabinet meeting is entirely to maintain the security of the country and the fighters of the National Socialist Party, and to decide on measures to suppress the communist secret gatherings that have been discovered recently.</p>

<p>Reuters, Punting, 22nd - Mr. and Mrs. Morrison took off this morning from Punting, Wales, England, to fly to New York. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison are the first couple to fly across the Atlantic together in one plane. In early June of this year, Mr. and Mrs. Morrison planned to cross to the United States, but the lower wing of the plane was damaged, resulting in failure. The plane was repaired a few weeks ago, and it was delayed until this morning to fly out due to waiting for good weather. After safely arriving in New York, they will make a non-stop flight directly to Baghdad, and then return to England. From then on, they will no longer make adventurous flights to break records. Morrison was previously known for being the first person to fly alone across the Atlantic from east to west, and has other amazing achievements. His wife, Ms. Amy Johnson, broke the previous record by flying from England to Australia in 1930, and is well-known in the aviation industry.</p>

<p>National, Edmonton, 22nd - American aviator Post safely arrived here from Fairbanks at 9:13 this morning. Post was originally expected to arrive here at 5:00 AM, but was delayed by four hours due to bad weather en route. There are still 20 hours available for flying from here to New York based on the previous record, while the actual flying time was only seven hours last time. Therefore, if there are no unexpected events en route, Post will definitely set a new record for circumnavigating the globe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Fairbanks, 21st - American aviator Post flew out of Flat Field at 6:28 this afternoon (British Summer Time). At present, his record still exceeds his old record by eight hours. If Post arrives in New York at midnight, he will definitely set a new record for circumnavigating the world.

He has now refueled and is only waiting for the weather to improve slightly to depart immediately and fly to Edmonton, Canada, then over Chicago and back to New York. If he can arrive in New York before Monday morning, he can still break the previous record, as he departed from New York at 6:24 on Saturday morning last week. If there are no unexpected obstacles along the way, it is not difficult to create a new record.</p>
<p>National, Edmonton, 22nd - American aviator Post waited for weather and rested for six hours in Fairbanks, and then departed at 9:28 last night to fly here. It is reported that the weather along the way is mostly suitable for flying. The aviation personnel here have prepared refueling and food procedures.

It is also said that the country has posted notices in the name of the first year of the East China Republic, publicizing anti-Manchuism, and has issued the "East China Political Report" to publish many documents to enlighten the people to resist Japan. As for the President of Political Affairs, it is heard to be someone named He, the Chairman of the Legislative Committee is someone named Tai, the Minister of the Army and Commander of the Fourth National Defense Army is Gusov (Soviet), the Minister of Foreign Affairs is Lemuting (Danish), the Minister of Finance is William (likely British or American), and there are also some other foreign personnel. As for the Commanders of the National Defense and River Defense Armies, they have also been appointed, and it seems that there is a large-scale political organization, so it is extremely concerned by the Japanese army. However, due to the green gauze tent period, it is not easy to attack. Mr. Wuteng and the heads of the Kwantung Army are currently gathering to discuss countermeasures. The following is the letter to the people, the letter to the world, and the published provisional constitution, to see the general content.</p>
<h3 id="e84">A Message to the Public <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>A message from the Republic of Huadong to all the people of the Republic of China, addressed to all newspaper offices of the Republic of China for the perusal of all elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts: We, the people of the Northeast, have previously suffered under the deep oppression and tyranny of warlords and subsequently under the devastation of neighboring imperialists. This has reduced us, the descendants of the illustrious Yellow Emperor, to the status of slaves and cattle. With hearts pierced and bleeding, fists clenched, and nails piercing flesh, we have risen in righteous revolt to expel the vile barbarians. We have fought for years, exhausting our food and depleting our ammunition, leaving us physically and mentally drained. We, the people of the Northeast, lament the unending great calamity and resent the impending doom of our nation. Therefore, we are embarking on a new path in diplomacy and politics. Embracing the spirit of national self-determination, we have, on the first day of June this year, declared the independence of a new nation, establishing our capital in Zhongjing, naming it Huadong, demonstrating the ambition of Zhang Liang to revive the state of Han, maintaining a republican system, upholding the righteousness of Lu Zhonglian who refused to serve the Qin empire. Recently, we have dispatched envoys to the Soviet Union and have already received verbal assurances of assistance. We earnestly appeal to all nations, hoping to obtain explicit recognition. Fortunately, patriots from the Three Hans [Korea] are returning, and righteous armies from the Four Provinces are responding in unison. With diligent efforts, we have already achieved a significant scale. This indicates that Heaven has not abandoned the Zhou dynasty, and a single army might revive the Xia dynasty. People universally yearn for the Han dynasty, and even a small number of households can overthrow Qin. We will strive to fulfill our duty to plan for human endeavors, hoping to reap the benefits of success ordained by Heaven. We hope that all elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts across the nation will regard us as the remaining survivors, understand us, remember that we are all descendants of our holy ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, extend assistance to us, jointly deliberate on national affairs, and rescue us from great difficulties. In the future, if our ancestral land recovers the Northeast, we will lead our people back, uniting under the same territory. This humble intention, we swear to Heaven and the sun. Alas, the ambition of our aggressive neighbors remains unfulfilled, and our perilous nation faces imminent demise. The lessons of the past are not distant; rescuing others is precisely how to save oneself. As the Western saying goes, failure is the mother of success. If you grieve over the bitter episodes of the Qin court, then join us in sharpening the blades to preserve the legacy of the Han. In grief and indignation, we present this plea, humbly beseeching your understanding and consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Message to All Nations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The message reads: We, the people of the four northeastern provinces of the Republic of China, deeply feel the unwarranted oppression by Japanese imperialism, which has created the puppet state of Manchukuo through fabricated public opinion. We, the people, resolutely refuse to recognize it. We also deeply feel that our motherland, the current Republic of China, is too weak to recover this vast lost territory. Therefore, on June 1, 1933, according to the will of all the people, with the spirit of national self-determination, and based on the fundamental principles of the League of Nations' investigative report, and with the benevolent assistance of friendly nations, we have established the Republic of Huadong. We have enacted a provisional constitution and implemented democratic governance. With the spirit of national independence, we aim to resolve the international disputes in the Far East and fulfill the mission of world peace. Within the territory of this independent nation, we adopt the principle of the Open Door Policy. People from all countries who wish to come here with a spirit of friendship to support the new nation and develop industries are extremely welcome. Furthermore, we hope that friendly nations will send personnel with a spirit of justice and humanity to investigate the facilities of this emerging nation and grant it formal recognition. Historical records show that revolutions such as that of the Republic of America and the independence of various Slavic nations in the Near East have all been sufficient to promote regional peace. The situation in the Far East is naturally the same. To eliminate the struggle between White imperialism and Red communism, establishing this buffer zone is particularly necessary. We have sent representatives to various countries to promote this cause, and we deeply hope that peace-loving nations will extend their assistance. This is our earnest expectation. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Provisional Constitution <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>

Nationals are equal regardless of religion, gender, class, ethnicity, or nationality. Chapter Three: Politics. (1) Political Parties. The Republic is governed by the Huadong Republican Party as the sole ruling party. All political, military, and educational personnel serving the Republic, as well as other important officials in various departments, must be party members. People are free to join or leave the party. Political parties that disagree with the Huadong Republican Party's political views may submit opinions for consideration and integration. If political views are absolutely conflicting, a special area may be designated for them to experiment with politics. After a year, experts will conduct an investigation, and the public will judge the results, adopting the advantages to improve the current administration. If there is no progress, the party's activities will be suspended. If it still does not repent, it will be deemed illegal, judged by law, or deported. (2) Government. The chief administrator of the Republic is the President, the administrator of the five provincial districts is the Provincial Executive, each provincial district is divided into ten counties, the administrator of each county district is the County Executive, each county district is divided into ten townships, and the administrator of each township district is the Township Executive. Administrators, except for the Township Executive who must be from the same township, are not limited by provincial or county origin. The government establishes a Legislative Committee, with one Chief Committee Member and fifty Committee Members, to formulate all laws. It is composed of specialized legislative talents elected by the party. The government establishes four departments: Education, Industry and Commerce, Finance, and Foreign Affairs. Each department, except the Foreign Affairs Department, establishes offices in each provincial district and sub-offices in each county district to handle their respective affairs. The central government establishes a Military and Political Affairs Institute, with the President concurrently serving as the Director. The institute has four departments: General Staff, Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Central District establishes the Central Army Garrison, with the military headquarters stationed in Zhongjing. Eastern Jilin Province is the first military region for national defense land forces. Eastern Heilongjiang Province is the second military region for national defense land forces. Eastern Liaoning Province is the third military region for national defense land forces. The Eastern Liaoning Province is the fourth military region for national defense land forces. The military headquarters are all located in the provincial capitals. The commanders of each army are directly under the jurisdiction of the Army Department. Fortresses for coastal and river defense establish national defense naval military regions. The central government establishes an Air Force Headquarters. The President concurrently serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Chapter Four: Livelihood. Government officials are uniformly regarded as labor unions. The annual salary of all workers in the country must not be less than 120 yuan and must not exceed 1,500 yuan. Forests, minerals, water resources, and transportation are all state-owned.

After completing compulsory education, the Selection Committee will determine the grade of employee (fifth class), and those with excellent grades may be promoted. From the age of seventeen to nineteen, a two-year period of compulsory military education is required. Chapter Six: Supplementary Provisions. If there are matters not covered in this Constitution, opinions may be proposed by five or more Legislative Committee members or one thousand or more citizens and submitted to the Legislative Committee for review, supplementation, and amendment. After the promulgation of the Constitution, the Provisional Constitution will be abolished.</p>

<p>Guo Yunlong Reports on Military Progress at the Front</p>
<p>Southwestern Political Council Promises to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The forces of Feng Yuxiang, Fang Zhenwu, and others have been attacking the rebel forces for days. According to Feng's telegram, Duolun has already been recovered. However, Feng is fighting alone and fears a lack of support. Therefore, he has specially dispatched Guo Yunlong, a staff officer and head of the propaganda section of the political department, as a representative to the South. After arriving in Guangzhou, Guo visited the authorities, reporting on the military situation at the front. It is said that military progress is very smooth, and the armies are determined to recover lost territory, with high morale. Many people are joining the cause. Fang Zhenwu serves as the Commander-in-Chief, and the entire army has a strength of over 40,000 men with approximately 30,000 rifles. The various units under his command include those of Ji Hongchang, Li Haiqing, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Renjie, and Bao Gang, totaling over 50,000 men, combined with Feng Yuxiang's directly subordinate troops. In total, the military force is approximately 100,000. These 100,000 soldiers have been fighting for months and have recently recovered Duolun. However, due to a lack of rear support, he specially dispatched the representative to the South to report on the situation at the front and to hope for the authorities' assistance in terms of funding and ammunition, so that the soldiers at the front will be well-fed and able to advance quickly to fulfill their long-cherished ambition of resisting Japan and saving the nation. Guo visited Zou Lu of the Southwestern Political Council yesterday, requesting assistance. Zou expressed great support for Feng and Fang's anti-Japanese stance and has also agreed to provide assistance. It is reported that Guo will stay in Guangzhou for a few days before returning north to report. (July 15)</p>
<p>New Hubei Provincial Government Established</p>
<h3 id="e88">All Committee Members Sworn into Office <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Government was reorganized and established on the 21st. The Chairman is Zhang Qun, and the committee members and directors of the departments are Meng Guangpeng (Civil Affairs), Jia Shiyi (Finance), Li Fanyi (Construction), Cheng Qibao (Education), and Lu Zhu (Secretary-General). The committee members are Li Shucheng, Fan Xixu, and Wu Guozhen. At the same time, a swearing-in ceremony was held. Prior to this, Jiang Zuobin, appointed by the central government, Shi Yancheng, appointed by the National Government, Huang Shaohong, appointed by the Executive Yuan, and He Chengjun, appointed by the General Headquarters, were designated as supervisors of the ceremony. All arrived in Hankou on the 20th. The ceremony was held at 10:00 AM on the 21st. In addition to the four supervisors, the guests included Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters Cao Haosen, Party and Government Committee member Geng Bozhao, Second Army Commander Jiang Dingwen, Wuhan Garrison Commander Ye Peng, Acting President of Wuhan University Wang Xinggong, elders Kong Geng and Fang Benren, among others. The ceremony was grand, unparalleled by previous establishments of the provincial government. After the meeting began, Chairman Zhang Qun led the committee members and department heads in taking the oath. After the oath, Jiang Zuobin, the central government supervisor, delivered a speech, stating that Hubei is located in a crucial position, and its stability or chaos affects the entire country. The committee members have long had a clear plan for governing Hubei. Today, what is offered is the hope that they will promote the party's principles and integrity, serving as a model for the entire province and even the entire country. Furthermore, they should save the people from their current dire straits with the empathy of feeling their hunger and drowning. If even one person is not properly cared for, it should be considered a failure to fulfill their duty. Next, National Government supervisor Shi Yancheng delivered a speech, stating that the external threat is pressing, and the internal turmoil has not subsided. Government personnel should plan to eliminate the Red bandits internally and resist the powerful externally. He hoped that the committee members would find a way out of the internal and external troubles. Next, Executive Yuan representative Huang Shaohong delivered a speech, divided into three points: 1. The government itself should establish trust so that the people believe in it. 2. The relationship between the central government and the provincial government should be close and connected as one. The previous barriers should be removed. 3. During the suppression of bandits, military operations should be supported by politics. The government should be responsible for the post-bandit affairs in the bandit areas. Next, Chiang General Commander specially appointed supervisor He Chengjun delivered a speech, divided into two points: 1. The people of Hubei are extremely poor and feel unable to bear the local taxes. He hoped that they would be eliminated to alleviate the people's suffering. 2. At the beginning of the bandit suppression, military and political cooperation should be sought. He hoped to discuss the parallel implementation of military and political affairs with the commanders of each route at any time. After the supervisors finished their speeches, Provincial Party Department representative Zeng Qingxi, elder Fang Benren, and Wuhan University President Wang Xinggong delivered speeches successively. Finally, Zhang Qun gave a reply, stating that Hubei is unfortunate. In recent years, floods and bandit disasters have come one after another. The market is depressed, and the rural areas are bankrupt. Thirty million compatriots are trapped in dire straits and cannot be saved. The central government, mindful of the local suffering, specially appointed Chairman Chiang last May to concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, granting him great power to suppress the Red bandits and reorganize politics. Over the past year, relying on the virtue and power of the Commander-in-Chief, the efforts of party, government, and military comrades, and the assistance of local people, military affairs have achieved results, and politics have also established a grand plan. In the future, all measures of this government should be based on central laws and the regulations of the General Headquarters as guidelines for implementation. On the passive side, we seek stability of order and clarity of officialdom; on the active side, we seek economic construction and increase the welfare of the people, not in the words of the document but in the effectiveness of the action. The sequence of progress should be carefully planned to complete the mission. No sacrifice will be spared. After Zhang finished his reply, music was played, and the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, the various departments and offices of the provincial government were taken over, and Feng Fei and Sun Jiyi were appointed as secretaries. Wang Yufen was appointed as the acting head of the First Section. To save expenses, a policy of austerity was decided, reducing more than twenty staff members and not hiring new ones to show impartiality. As for former Chairman Xia Douyin, he left Hankou on the evening of the 19th to visit Chiang in Xun, reporting on the course of his administration. The date of his return to Hankou is yet to be determined. (July 21)</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Rickshaw Pullers' Rent Reduction Movement Resolved <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers of this city went on strike on the 20th due to crackdowns by traffic police and suddenly demanded rent reductions from the two rickshaw companies. Despite repeated persuasion from the companies, the pullers insisted on reducing the daily rent by one dime. A portion of the pullers claimed to have the assistance of a certain Lu and would not stop until they achieved their goal, creating a tense situation. The county government believed that this rent reduction issue, with the pullers failing to elect representatives and lacking official documentation, forming large groups, was a matter of public security. Therefore, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jing and First District Chief Zhong Taishi to handle the matter properly. Chief Shen and others convened labor-management mediation, but no labor representatives attended, and the matter could not be resolved yesterday. Therefore, today (22nd) at 10:00 AM, Chief Shen and District Chief Zhong, together with Party Committee member Shen Yuxuan, went to the Ni Jiadai Square and convened the pullers. After much persuasion, it was decided to reduce the daily rent by six cents, and the daily rent would be thirty cents from now on. The pullers unanimously agreed, pulled their rickshaws to the rickshaw companies, and resumed business. However, the three-day strike by the pullers has already resulted in considerable losses for the rickshaw companies.</p>

<p>The case of Liu Gouzi, a Nanjing resident, raping Chen Jifang, a young girl from a dyeing workshop, was concluded after investigation by the Procuratorate, which filed a lawsuit with the criminal court.

<p>The Pingchao District Security Corps of Nantong opened fire and brutally killed four farmers and injured more than ten others due to the collection of security donations. The provincial government ordered the county to transfer the case to the judiciary for trial. The criminal court has now concluded the trial, and the verdict will be announced on the 28th.

<h3 id="e92">Kidnappers in the Han Case Brought to Wuxi for Interrogation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, and seven other suspects in the case of Han Wentai, the township head of Xushe Township (Yangming Township) in the third district of the county, being kidnapped and murdered, have repeatedly been pursued by county government officials to Shanghai to petition the First Special District Court for their extradition, but without success. Therefore, the county government transferred the case to the court for handling. The Procuratorate of the court dispatched bailiff Chen Zuosheng and police chief Wu Zhengrong to Shanghai again to seek their extradition. On the morning of the 21st, the Shanghai Special Court held another hearing on the case. Li Zhiping and Yuan Yonghe were summoned to court. Lawyers Li Yan, Zheng Wenkai, and Yue Junying defended Li, and lawyer Sun Zuji defended Yuan. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi also arrived in court on time. Jiang Hanchen was unable to attend due to illness, and a proxy lawyer appeared in court. Criminal Court Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. The defendant's lawyers stood up one after another and argued forcefully, requesting that the defendants not be extradited. The police lawyer also stood up and expressed his opinion. As a result, the court ordered that since the Wuxi court had dispatched police to seek their extradition, the extradition for interrogation was approved. Bailiff Chen Zuosheng, police officers Hu Wenhan, and Lu Shaohuang then escorted Li Zhiping and Yuan Yonghe onto a train to Wuxi and sent them to the Supreme Court for investigation and detention. County Magistrate Yan and Police Chief Wu remained in Shanghai to continue negotiating the extradition of the other suspects. It is expected that they will return to Wuxi on the night express train at 6:00 PM today (23rd). However, Chen Fugeng, Ding Fugui, Jin Hengpei, and Hu Shifu, who were released, are still at large and cannot be arrested.</p>

<p>Cao Shuiquan, a villager from Beicao Village, Tu 341, Taibo Township, Twelfth District, was 42 years old and worked as a farmer. He had a wife, five sons, and one daughter, resulting in high expenses and a difficult situation. Last month, his wife suddenly fell seriously ill, and Cao sold the wheat harvested from the fields to hire a doctor for treatment. Fortunately, she recovered shortly after, but he had spent a considerable amount of money, leaving the family without a penny. Seeing his eldest son and young daughters crying for food, the couple argued, and Cao, feeling overwhelmed by the dire situation, had a death wish. He hanged himself when his wife went to Ning the other day. When his wife returned home and discovered the body, she wailed loudly, and the orphaned children also cried, shaking the fields. Those who heard it were saddened.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Two Night Boats Robbed <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xu Rongda, a Changshu resident, runs the Xichang (Wuxi to Changshu) night boat. Recently, due to the hot weather, the business of the night boat has been quite good. The other day (19th) afternoon, as usual, he sailed from Chang to Xi. Around 3:00 AM, when passing the Huangcaodu area in the sixth district of Xi territory, he suddenly encountered a boat with nine strong men, speaking with a northern accent, each holding a sharp weapon and wearing a red turban on their heads. They robbed the ferry boat, taking forty yuan in cash and eight bales of foreign yarn before fleeing. Chen Qiunan, a Luyuan resident, who also runs the Changxi night boat, was robbed by the same thieves on the night of the 20th when passing the Sanjiankou area west of Tongjing Bridge. Because the boat crew resisted, they were all tied up, and seventeen yuan in cash, two yuan in corner tickets, five thousand copper coins, eighty-two bolts of white cloth, a leather bag, and three bags of clothing from the passengers were stolen, totaling an estimated loss of three or four hundred yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Dispute over Drug Investigation Resolved Through Judiciary <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Investigators from the Drug Enforcement Office went to Luyuan Town to search for Zeng's private opium, resulting in the seizure of gold and silver jewelry and the detention of merchants Qian Jichang, Qian Jinsi, Xie Hongsheng, Gao Zhenhuan, Wang Zhangyan, Ji Si, Zhu Xubao, Qian Jinsi, and nine others. This sparked public anger and led to a market strike. It is reported that after the incident occurred, it attracted attention from the surrounding areas. The merchants and residents of Luyuan even sent representatives to the city to request relief from the party and government authorities. County Magistrate Zhou promised to investigate and verify the matter. The Drug Enforcement Office originally intended to take the detained merchants to the headquarters for investigation, but seeing the public's resistance, they sent all the individuals to the county government for processing on the afternoon of the 20th. They were questioned by the county government. According to the testimony of investigator Qin Yunsheng and others, they went to Luyuan to investigate drugs under the order of the director and did not engage in robbery. Qian Jichang and others gathered a crowd and beat the investigators, causing injuries to investigator Li Gengsheng and others. Therefore, they were arrested and brought to the city for legal action. According to the testimony of Qian and Xie, they are all residents of Luyuan. On the 18th, the investigators went to Zeng's residence, claiming to be investigating drugs, and searched arbitrarily, causing misunderstandings among the people. Zeng rang the gong and gathered a crowd to fight each other, but they did not participate. The officials then ordered both sides to post bail and wait for further questioning after investigation. As for the Luyuan market, after the petition representatives returned to their hometown and reported the petition process, Chief Xu Jingyu and others from the Fifth District personally went to Luyuan Town to persuade the people in detail. The market reopened on the afternoon of the 21st, awaiting judicial resolution.</p>

<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the people of the country witnessed the violence of Japanese aircraft and deeply felt the necessity of promoting aviation construction. Therefore, the government and the people rose up to make efforts to save the country through aviation. At the beginning of the establishment of the China Aviation Association, the purchase of aircraft to strengthen its power was generally advocated, while the cultivation of talents was also advocated by the majority. At that time, the association had a proposal to organize a flying club. The secretary-general of the association, Mr. Lin Wojiang, went to Hangzhou several times to discuss with the Aviation Administration about borrowing training aircraft, flying fields, and instructors, and obtained the consent of the Aviation Administration. Due to limited funding, it could not be implemented immediately. Subsequently, the association began a large-scale solicitation in Shanghai. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company generously donated 100,000 yuan, but specified that it should be used for the cultivation of aviation talents. The association then contacted the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company regarding the proposal to organize a flying club, and obtained their approval. After submitting it to the standing council for discussion, it was resolved to be reviewed by committee members Lin Wojiang and Lin Kanghou. According to Lin Wojiang yesterday, the draft has been reviewed and revised and will be submitted to the council for discussion and approval. It will then be necessary to go to Hangzhou to contact the Aviation Administration.</p>

<p>The Association to Abolish Civil War believes there are talks of the Central Government using troops against Chahar, and yesterday urgently sent telegrams to the National Government's Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Peiping Military Branch, stating: "To the Nanjing National Government's Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Peiping Military Branch: As foreign aggression has not ceased and banditry is rampant, we are greatly alarmed to hear of talks of using troops against Chahar. In our humble opinion, if Feng is truly determined to resist Japan, then protecting Chahar should be tolerated. If he has other ideas, they should be resolved through political means, avoiding military force. In short, the nation's vitality should not be further damaged; real strength should be reserved to resist foreign aggression. This is the public's will. We pray for your consideration." The General Association of the Association to Abolish Civil War respectfully submits.</p>

<p>It is said that Mr. Huang Musong, the Special Envoy for Xinjiang Province, is under surveillance in Xinjiang, and therefore the Central Authorities have specially dispatched Eurasia Corporation's No. 1 aircraft to Xinjiang to pick up Huang and return him to the capital. Yesterday, the Beijing telegram even said that Mr. Huang would arrive in Beijing at 4:00 PM yesterday. However, according to news from Eurasia Corporation, the company absolutely did not dispatch a special aircraft to Xinjiang. The company's aircraft flying east from Xinjiang departed on the 21st of this month and should arrive in Beijing at 3:30 PM today (yesterday). However, it is unknown whether Special Envoy Huang is returning to Beijing on this flight. Furthermore, the company recently fears that personnel at various stations along the route may express opinions that involve local politics, which could lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, it has specifically telegraphed the heads of each station not to express any opinions regarding local political or military affairs.</p>

<p>The Period Expires at the End of July and Should Be Stopped</p>
<p>Due to Financial Exhaustion, the Decision is Made to Continue Levying</p>
<p>In August of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the Ministry of Finance, in order to raise funds to alleviate financial difficulties, presented a request to the Executive Yuan to levy an additional 5% customs surtax. The period for this surtax expires on July 31st of this year, and whether or not it will be stopped has attracted considerable attention from the outside world. According to news from the Ministry of Finance, the surtax should naturally be stopped upon the expiration of the period. However, in recent years, China's trade has been sluggish, and national tax revenues have not improved. The government's finances are still difficult. Therefore, continuing to levy the tax is, in fact, necessary. The Ministry of Finance has now submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, based on the reasons, to continue levying the tax. Once the Executive Yuan approves it and submits it to the Legislative Yuan for review, it can be announced.</p>

<p>Establish Three Committees to Proceed Separately</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation is the earliest organization of Chinese people, and many important figures in the Party and the country have come from this organization. Since the new executive and supervisory committee members took office, in order to seek the happiness of overseas Chinese, they have actively expanded the work of the association. At present, three committees have been established, and personnel have been assigned to be responsible for drafting. The three committees that have been established are: (1) Membership Recruitment Committee, responsible for planning by Chen Wulie, Xu Jigong, Huang Jianzhong, Xie Denan, etc.; (2) Fund Management Committee. The association has begun to raise funds from overseas Chinese for the construction of a new clubhouse, but with the huge sum of 500,000 yuan, a special management committee has been organized, and it has been decided that under no circumstances may these funds be used for other purposes. Cui Tongyue, Qiu Hanping, Xu Jigong, and Chen Wulie have been publicly nominated to be responsible for drafting the management regulations; (3) Budget Revenue and Expenditure Committee. The association's current monthly operating expenses are about 2,000 yuan. According to established practice, if the operating expenses are insufficient, the association must raise special funds to supplement them, and if there is a surplus, it will be transferred to the next year's operating expenses. However, this budget is of great importance. Zheng Wenyuan, Wang Zhicheng, Huang Jianzhong, Chen Hulie, Xu Jigong, Qiu Hanping, etc., have been publicly nominated to be responsible for handling the budget. The drafting work of these three committees has been completed, and a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees will be held today (the 23rd) for open discussion, in order to revise and approve it, so that it can be implemented according to the plan.</p>

<p>The Activities in Various Places are Becoming Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>The Momentum Along the Beining Line is Even Greater</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times News Agency reported from this port that, recently, the Northeastern Volunteer Army has been carrying out large-scale activities due to the rising green crops. The Japanese and puppet troops are running around and are exhausted. The Japanese Consulate in this port recently released news, also acknowledging that the situation is serious. It can be seen that the hearts of our people in the Northeast have not died. If they can receive sufficient supplies and substantial assistance, it is not impossible to recover the lost territories. The following is a record of what the Japanese side reported, in its original wording. The bandit army (the Japanese always refer to the righteous army as bandit army) in Liaoning Province has now increased to more than 25,000 and continues to operate in various places. (1) There are currently 11,000 bandit troops (i.e., the righteous army, the same below) in the area bordering Liaoning and Jilin provinces to the east of Dongping. They often attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army has now begun large-scale operations and has mobilized a large part of its forces to move to Yuan, Hailong, Jinchuan, Liuhe, Xinbin, Tonghua, and other important places to suppress them, hoping to encircle them. It is expected that there will be optimistic prospects by the end of August. (2) The triangular area of Dalian, Shenyang, and Andong is currently occupied by bandit troops. The Japanese and Manchu armies are engaged in fierce fighting. (3) The activities of bandit troops are particularly strong in various parts of western Liaoning. The Japanese and Manchu armies have launched many attacks but have failed. They are still holding their original positions. The bandit troops along the Beining Line on the border between Liaoning and Rehe have an even greater momentum, with more than 6,000 people. They are constantly pressing the Japanese army. Reinforcements have now arrived, and there will be a fierce battle soon. It cannot be taken lightly.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Municipal Farmers' Association Asks the Municipal Government to Implement Local Autonomy <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Rural Revitalization of This City is Deeply Dependent on It</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association regards local autonomy as the most important task during the period of political tutelage. The Municipal Government, due to the situation, temporarily suspended the work of autonomy, causing the past preparations to fall short. The association specially submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting the immediate resumption of the Autonomy Preparatory Committee and the completion of autonomy below the district level according to the original plan. The original submission is recorded as follows: "Regarding the request to immediately resume the Autonomy Preparatory Committee, establish district offices, and handle autonomy matters. We believe that promoting local autonomy is the most important task during the period of political tutelage. It is discussed in detail in Sun Yat-sen's writings and in the resolutions and declarations of the Central Government on various occasions. The Central Government and the National Government have also successively stipulated and ordered party branches and governments at all levels to earnestly comply. This city then established the Autonomy Preparatory Committee in July of last year. It is heard that all the survey elections, various regulations, forms, and registers, the establishment of boundary markers in each district, have been prepared, and it is also learned that the heads of the autonomous districts in each district have also been selected and appointed. Just as it was about to proceed step by step, the alarm of Pingjin came, and the security of Shanghai was inevitably affected, so the Autonomy Preparatory Committee was curtailed, and the autonomy work was invisibly suspended. The effort of nine spans was abandoned in one basket, which caused everyone to sigh. Recently, the truce agreement in North China has been concluded, and the situation has eased. The security of Shanghai has become more peaceful day by day, and preparations are being made for the post-war revival. At a time when rural organizations are dispersed and the rural economy is bankrupt, the implementation of autonomy seems to be a matter that cannot be delayed. Matters such as the census, personnel registration, land survey, land price regulation, road construction, water conservancy, and the promotion of education and culture, the organization of cooperatives, and the regulation of food, etc., all rely on local autonomous organs for promotion. Recently, the Central Executive Committee issued the Guiding Outline for Local Autonomy, which also earnestly regards guiding autonomy as an urgent plan to save the current national crisis. For the sake of saving the national crisis and for the sake of revitalizing the countryside, this association dares to fully state the situation and respectfully requests that you immediately resume the work of the Autonomy Preparatory Committee and complete the autonomy below the district level according to the original plan, so that the prototype of the city's past preparations for autonomy and the prepared survey election items will not be wasted, and the revival of the city's countryside will also be greatly benefited. Upon submission, we cannot express the utmost impatience of waiting for orders."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Telegrams Can Use Arabic Numerals <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Save Telegraph Fees for Senders</p>
<p>Implemented from August 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday that, according to regulations, the house numbers in the address of the recipient of Chinese telegrams and the numbers in the text of the telegrams must be written in words, which requires a large number of characters. Now, in order to facilitate communication for the public, a new method has been formulated: the aforementioned house numbers and numbers may be written by the sender in Arabic numerals to save characters. For example, "1105 Nanjing Road, Shanghai" may be written as "Shanghai Nanjing Road 1105". "6409 yuan" may be written as "6409 yuan". "3 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen" may be written as "375 yuan", or "3 yuan 75 fen". The aforementioned numbers should be enclosed in parentheses before and after by the sender to avoid confusion with the telegraph code. The charging method is: in clear text Chinese telegrams, every one to four Arabic numerals is charged as one character; beyond this, every one to four additional numerals is charged as one character. In coded text Chinese telegrams, every one to five Arabic numerals is charged as one character. In clear and coded telegrams, decimal points are counted as one numeral. Parentheses are not charged. This method will be implemented from August 1st. However, it does not apply to telegrams sent abroad or transmitted via foreign lines.</p>
<h3 id="e129">&lt;Appointment of Directors and Supervisors of the Industrial Development and Trust Company]　　Li Ming and others as Directors　　Lin Kanghou as Supervisor <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>To help citizens solve housing problems and guide public utilities related to people's livelihood, the municipal government has specially organized the Industrial Development and Trust Cooperative. All the cooperative's funds have been secured, and it could have been established earlier. However, its articles of association were previously submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, which the Executive Yuan forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review. A reply has not yet been received. But, the municipal government believes the cooperative needs to be established urgently, so the mayor has appointed Li Ming, Xu Xinliu, Wu Yunzhai, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, and Feng Bingnan as directors, and Lin Kanghou as supervisor. The opening will take place as soon as the Executive Yuan's order arrives.</p>

<p>For public health, the Shanghai Municipal Council recently established new licensing regulations for the sale of butter and margarine within the Settlement, which were promulgated on July 5th as Bulletin No. 4380. Now, to ease the burden on merchants, it has been decided that artificially colored margarine with harmless colors will also be temporarily permitted. Furthermore, regarding packaging regulations, full compliance may take time. Therefore, retailers who apply to the Municipal Council can postpone this requirement until January 1st of next year, when it will be fully implemented. These amended regulations have been published in the Gazette, Issue No. 28, and will be promulgated soon.</p>

<p>The Committee for Maintaining the Original Site of the Jiangyin Street Market in the Shanghai South Shanghai District recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Cizhu Tuan, stating that regarding the construction of the Chezhan Road Market and the planned relocation of the Jiangyin Street Market, all members of the committee believe that the plan would lead to the collapse of business on Jiangyin Street, so they unanimously and firmly oppose it. For the sake of the charitable purpose of the group, and as citizens, they offer a humble suggestion: The area near Dongzhan Road lacks well-equipped schools, and there are many old-fashioned private schools, which hinder local education. Therefore, they request that the group change the location planned for the market to a primary school, so that children in the vicinity may have the opportunity to study.</p>

<p>Westerner Returns from Failure to Victory　　Xie Yu Repeatedly Petitions for Bankruptcy</p>
<p>The Westerner, Yi Yi Haimeng, had previously entrusted the Xie Yu Gold Shop in Shanghai with large-scale speculation in margin trading. Due to unfavorable circumstances, he suffered heavy losses and owed Xie Yu over 100,000 taels of silver. The checks he issued for 60,000 taels of silver were not honored upon maturity, leading the holder, Feng Yu Gold Shop, to sue Xie Yu Gold Shop in the First Special District Court. The case has now concluded after three trials and is nearing the execution stage. The details are summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Please Postpone Prosecution <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Westerner, originally from Jewish descent, had speculated unsuccessfully in Shanghai in 1931, owing Xie Yu Gold Shop over 100,000 taels of silver. He had issued three checks totaling 60,000 taels of silver. Xie Yu had given two of these checks, worth 50,000 taels, to Feng Yu Gold Shop, and one check worth 10,000 taels to a Hakka merchant. However, the checks were returned unpaid upon maturity. Feng Yu, as the holder, sued Xie Yu in the First Special District Court to recover the debt, and Xie Yu in turn sued Yi Yi Haimeng (the Westerner) jointly. At the end of the first trial, the Westerner stated to Xie Yu that he had no cash and pleaded for a postponement of the prosecution, promising to repay the full amount as soon as the opportunity arose.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Accommodating Response <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>He also instructed the owner of Xie Yu Gold Shop to accommodate the lawsuit from Feng Yu Gold Shop, the holder of the check. In the second trial, he paid Xie Yu 5,000 taels of silver for litigation and public expenses. The lawyer hired at the time also advocated for a settlement as the best course of action, leading to delays until now. Eventually, the Westerner left Shanghai for France. The case has now concluded after three trials and is nearing the execution stage.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Profits in France <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since being implicated and dragged down by the Westerner Yi Yi Haimeng, Xie Yu Gold Shop has suffered significant losses for three years. All expenses incurred in the three trials of the case were borrowed. After the Westerner left Shanghai, he made large profits trading in bills of exchange in France. After learning of this, the owner of Xie Yu Gold Shop telegraphed the Westerner yesterday, urging him to consider his moral obligations, promptly fulfill his previous agreement, and come to China immediately to clear the debts, in order to save lives and alleviate the desperate situation.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Taikoo Strike: Guangdong Seamen Oppose Resolution in Shanghai <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Huge Losses for Merchants' Goods　　Escalation of Situation Involves Politicization; Party Headquarters Negotiates on Behalf</p>
<p>The Guangdong Seamen's Union has been on strike, stopping the loading and unloading of Taikoo ships for nearly a month. The company has not accepted the conditions put forward by the Seamen's Union and has also voluntarily abandoned cargo loading and passenger operations in Guangzhou. This has become a chronic stalemate. The Guangdong Seamen's Union is directly under the Southwest Central Party Headquarters and is not guided by any other party. Now, the Seamen's Union has submitted the entire strike to the Southwest Central Party Headquarters for direct negotiation with the Taikoo Company. It is reported that the Southwest Five Provinces Foreign Affairs Office has, at the request of the Party Headquarters, sent a letter to the Taikoo Company.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Chambers of Commerce Write to London <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The goods stored in the Taikoo Company's warehouse in Guangzhou, which have been obstructed by the strike, are worth millions of dollars, mainly grains, but also a lot of northern goods. Due to prolonged storage, many have become moldy and damaged. Merchants have suffered great losses. Therefore, the various Guangdong trade guilds have sent a public telegram to the Taikoo Company, proposing to negotiate with the Guangdong Seamen's Union to first unload grains and other goods. Taikoo replied expressing agreement, but disclaimed responsibility for any obstructions. Currently, the Guangdong trade guilds have jointly sent a letter to the head office of Taikoo in London, stating that the seamen's strike has caused significant losses to many merchants due to the accumulation of goods. The Guangdong merchants requested the goods be unloaded, but Taikoo disclaimed responsibility, and that the shipping company should bear full responsibility for these losses.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Oppose Transfer to Shanghai for Negotiations <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company believes that this strike was triggered by the dismissal of stewards from the Wusong ships and that the issue should not be discussed in Guangzhou, because Wusong involves ships of the Yangtze River. The issue should be moved to Shanghai for discussion. The Taikoo Company has telegraphed Guangdong guests, expressing that a resolution in Guangzhou would be difficult. At the same time, the chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, Yu Qiaqing, also telegraphed Guangdong, severely criticizing the bad habits of the stewards and urging the Seamen's Union to jointly maintain the ailing shipping industry. Currently, the Guangdong Seamen's Union has telegraphed Shanghai, stating that the case is being handled by the Southwest Central Party Headquarters and fundamentally opposes resolution in Shanghai. Therefore, the matter now involves greater connections, potentially moving from a labor strike to political involvement. The air in Guangdong regarding a certain magnate of the shipping industry is very negative. The seamen say that there may be other intentions behind the prolonged strike.</p>

<p>Since the fishery construction fee dispute occurred, after efforts and mediation by Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry has shown understanding for merchants. Through the three mediations, fish merchants representative Meng Lujiu and others have achieved satisfactory results. The case is no longer an issue. Meng Lujiu returned to Hangzhou on the 16th of this month and convened a meeting of fellow members the next day to discuss expressing gratitude for the three gentlemen's mediation efforts and sent a telegram of thanks. The telegram text is as follows: "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Yu Zuoting of Shanghai, all respected sirs: Previously, our association and fellow members were forced by the Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Zhengshou sub-bureaus to collect fishery construction fees on their behalf. Director Wu Weinan imposed harsh penalties, causing great distress. Merchants repeatedly appealed to the authorities for relief, but to no avail. Yesterday, our chairman reported back to Hangzhou. During this trip to Shanghai, we thank you for your three mediations and the presentation of nine items for separate handling. Among them, the cancellation of the collection office for dried scallops, exempting all domestic products, and taxing import and export fish only once, without further taxation, have particularly benefited our fellow members. Your painstaking efforts and upholding of justice have not only benefited our fellow members but also all fishery organizations. In joy, we hereby send this telegram of thanks. All members of the Hangzhou Ham, Pickled Meat, Fish, and Salted Fish Trade Association."</p>

<p>Over Ten Ship Owners and Crew Members Unaccounted For　　Few Crew Members Rescued and Report to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Jiaozhou sandboat Chen Zengxing recently loaded soybean oil, northern goods, and other cargo in the vicinity of Nuguo in Jiaozhou and set sail for Shanghai. The other day, when it sailed to Fushan near Changshu, it encountered wind and was driven by waves to run aground off the coast of Nantongzhou. The bottom of the boat was stuck on the reef, and the tide gradually entered. The boat sounded the steel signal for help. At that time, the wind was very strong, and the small fishing boats on the coast did not dare to approach for rescue. Eventually, the bottom of the boat broke, and the water in the hold gradually submerged the deck. The boat owner, Liu Yukun, and over twenty crew members lowered the sampan to await rescue. However, the boat was small and there were many people, and everyone was extremely panicked, rushing to jump into the sampan, causing it to capsize. Those who had not jumped in were even more frightened. Seven or eight crew members threw planks or awnings into the sea, jumped onto them, and drifted with the wind. After a day and night, they drifted to the waters of Haimen, where they were rescued by a Tonghai steamer and taken to Haimen. Yesterday, they came to Shanghai by ship to report to the various cargo firms. It is said that the boat is now only a few feet above the water surface, and all the equipment on board has been washed away. When the boat ran aground, the oil tanks were damaged, and the oil spread across the sea. The cargo on board was worth over 50,000 yuan. However, over ten crew members including the boat owner Liu were thrown into the water as the sampan capsized. No boats were seen to rescue them at the time, and it is feared they have drowned. It is heard that a fishing boat rescued five or six people, but it is not known for sure. Now, the various cargo firms have hired a steamer to go to the scene of the accident to see if the boat can be salvaged and to investigate whether the missing boat owner Liu and the others have been rescued, in order to search for them.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Hero Ma Zhanshan Visiting Factories</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, the anti-Japanese hero, visited factories in various countries on his way back home, which greatly impressed him. After arriving in Shanghai, he took time to visit major factories, hoping to instruct the Chinese people with what he learned from visiting factories in various countries. At 11:00 AM the other day, Mr. Ma visited the Huasheng Electric Appliance Manufacturing Factory, after being invited to Mr. Ma’s residence in person by the factory’s Yu Zhongxian, and then went with the director Wang Kaihua to the factory by car. They were received by the factory manager Ye Youcai. After a short rest, Yang Jichuan, Yuan Zongyao, and Cao Yugui guided them to visit each manufacturing department in detail, asking questions one by one. Mr. Yang and others answered in detail, and Mr. Ma deeply praised them, saying that Chinese people can manufacture electric fans and generators themselves, saving a lot of outflowing funds, demonstrating that the organizers have a unique vision, and that both the spirit and material aspects are excellent, with many encouragements. On that day, the factory hung the flag of the party and the country to express welcome, but followed Mr. Ma's wishes and only prepared tea and snacks. All the workers of the factory, in order to admire the anti-Japanese hero, all wanted to see Mr. Ma's demeanor, and specially selected four representatives to salute and pay tribute to Mr. Ma to express their admiration. In addition to returning the salute, Mr. Ma also slightly encouraged the workers' representatives. It was not until 12:00 that he said goodbye and returned to his residence by car.</p>

<p>Wu Yugan, the newly appointed acting president of the School of Business at Central University, located at 1698 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, drove to the school at around 10:30 AM yesterday. Upon arriving at the school gate, a student suddenly approached him and greeted him. For some unknown reason, a conflict arose during the conversation. The student stopped Mr. Wu and loudly argued with him. Mr. Wu, unable to bear it, raised his hand and slapped the student. The two sides became entangled in a brawl. As they were arguing, two other students slowly came out and, seeing the situation, questioned Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu, outnumbered at this point, rushed inside. The students followed him in, and a staff member, fearing a major disaster, immediately called the Rue Petain police station. The police chief dispatched detectives to the scene and arrested everyone together. The students said that President Wu raised his hand and beat people, and President Wu admitted it without denying. As a result, after being reprimanded by the police chief, both parties were released.</p>

<p>Hua Men, a western detective from the Putuo Road Police Station, recently received a tip that Zhang Mingye, a resident of Anhui province residing at 271 Zhangjiazhai, Carde Road, was engaged in selling counterfeit money, disrupting the financial system. He then ordered Chinese detective Chen Hongbiao to investigate, posing as a customer. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month at 5:00 PM, he met with Zhang and started buying and selling negotiations. At that time, it was agreed that the selling price was 30 yuan per hundred yuan of counterfeit money. He first paid for five counterfeit China Bank yuan bills. By the 18th, he had purchased two ten-yuan counterfeit Jiaotong Bank notes, one ten-yuan banknote from the Northeast Provinces Bank, and one five-yuan counterfeit China Bank note from Zhang. Before leaving, he also agreed to trade a large batch of counterfeit money next time, scheduled for delivery the other day. When the date arrived, Chinese and Western detectives secretly waited near Carde Road. Detective Chen went to Zhang's residence to meet him. Zhang went out and returned shortly thereafter and was arrested. Forty five-yuan counterfeit Jiaotong Bank notes and nine five-yuan counterfeit China Bank notes were found on his person and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu, he started by stating the case situation, saying that the police station is now prosecuting according to Article 211, Section 2 and Article 212 of the Criminal Law, for the crime of counterfeiting currency, but there are still major offenders at large in this case, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing. In addition, Chinese and Western detectives testified about the situation of contacting the defendant for buying and selling, and submitted the counterfeit currency seized before and after. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Mingye confessed that the banknotes were purchased from Su Huanwen of Chang'an Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei. After the auditor Liu Yugui verified the confession, he ordered Zhang to be detained pending further investigation in seven days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a public letter to this newspaper, stating that there is an unclaimed wooden box and asking people to claim it. The original letter is as follows: To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: The case is based on a report from the director of the Second Precinct of the First District, Liu Yunfang, stating that according to a report from Police Chief Li Xuede of the Fuyoumen Police Station, at 2:10 AM on the 13th of this month, Guard Xue Yuzhang saw a wooden box placed in the dark place in front of the Kelizhong Hospital in Sanyinong, with no one guarding it, fearing it was an item of unknown origin. Therefore, he sent the wooden box to the police station for verification. Based on this, it was ordered that the box be opened in the presence of witnesses, and it was found to contain more than a dozen pieces of old cloth clothing. Other than that, there was nothing else. After inspection, it was sealed and stored again. Since the wooden box was unguarded, it is assumed to be a stolen item. In addition to temporarily ordering subordinates to investigate and pursue the matter, we hereby send this wooden box, along with the original clothing and other items, to your bureau for public announcement and claim. Sincerely, Jianghai Customs Chinese Secretary's Office, July 22nd.</p>

<p>Head of the Bao Wei Regiment Shot</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 3:00 AM, over twenty bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhu Baosheng, the head of the Juyuan Bridge Bao Wei Regiment, which is about six li northeast of Luodian Town in Baoshan County. They were armed with pistols, box guns, and both long and short knives, as well as iron and wooden clubs, and spoke with local accents. The bandits first used large stones to smash open the front door and enter the house. At that time, Zhu and his family were already asleep. Hearing the loud noise outside, Zhu immediately put on his clothes and went out to investigate. When the bandits saw Zhu, they immediately fired several box guns. One shot hit Zhu's right foot bone, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. Zhu's wife and children, hearing the gunshots, all fled out the back door and hid in the fields. After seeing Zhu fall to the ground, the bandits suspected that he was dead, so they broke into the bedroom, searching and overturning boxes and cabinets, robbing 60 yuan in silver notes, over 100 yuan in silver coins, 20,000 copper coins, and clothing and ornaments worth over 300 yuan in total. After robbing, the bandits lined up, called roll call, and then left in a swagger like troops. The family members ran to the Luodian Town Public Security Bureau to report, but the bandits had already disappeared. The injured man was sent to Liuhui Zhong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was to the foot bone and not life-threatening.</p>

<p>Chen Asan, a 30-year-old cart driver from Gaoyou, was employed by Liu Quansheng at 539 Ningbo Road. The other day at around 8:00 PM, the switch on the lamp in his employer's bedroom suddenly malfunctioned, causing an immediate short circuit. Sparks flew in all directions, setting fire to the bed curtains. Fortunately, Liu's maid, Chen Wang, caught sight of it, shouted loudly in alarm. Chen, hearing of the fire, immediately fetched a bucket of water and ran to extinguish it. Unexpectedly, although the fire was extinguished, Chen intended to investigate the cause of the short circuit, causing him to touch the electrical equipment, and he immediately fainted and lost consciousness. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, and police were dispatched to investigate. The body was sent to the Philomene Road coroner's office. Yesterday morning, a report was sent to the First Special District Local Court, and Prosecutor Zhang Junqing was appointed to visit the office to examine the body. According to the testimony of Chen Wang, the maid, on that day, the employer and others were out and had not returned, so there was only one person sitting in the bedroom. Suddenly, she saw a fire in the bed curtains, and she could do nothing, so she called the deceased to come and put out the fire. Unexpectedly, he was electrocuted and died. According to the testimony of the deceased's wife, Chen Liu, Zhang Jun ruled that the deceased Chen Asan had indeed died from electrocution. The body was handed over to his wife, Chen Liu, to claim and bury.</p>

Executive committee members Fang Jiaobo, Chen Songyuan, Ye Jiaxing, Tang Youwei, Ye Xiaoshan, Lu Xingzhuang, and others were present. Observers included solicitor Wang Zhixiang, Liang Baolin, and policyholder representative Gu Chengjiao, among others. Fang Jiaobo, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Tang Youwei, who stated that the disaster area fire insurance claims negotiations were of great importance and not easy to succeed. Whether they could succeed depended on whether they could fight to the end. The association's recent work had many aspects that were not suitable for publicity, so news in the newspapers was quiet. However, the work that should be done has not stopped for a single day, but some simple-minded people blamed the association for being ineffective and criticized it in various unreasonable ways, which inevitably discouraged enthusiastic volunteers. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) The general meeting will be convened when there is a solution.</p>
<p>(2) Prepare for large-scale claims, and do not stop even if blood flows into a river. This matter will be handled actively by the claims committee with full authority.</p>
<p>(3) The association will write to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the British and French Concessions, asking them to coordinate with the police stations of the two concessions to provide protection for policyholders' claims.</p>
<p>(4) The claims committee's operating expenses will be subsidized by the executive committee at 30 yuan per month.</p>
<p>(5) Executive committee members Ye Jiaxing, Tang Youwei, Ye Xiaoshan, and claims committee members Wang Zhixiang, Xu Zaikang, and Lou Qiying will be appointed to meet with Mayor Wu to request a quick solution. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>

The organizing committee has been responsible for preparing everything for the annual meeting. The society notified its members yesterday, saying, "Since the separation of the nine regions and the fraternity of Jinlan, time has flown by, and the cold and heat have changed in an instant. The third annual meeting of this society is about to be held in Wuhan. The main purpose of the annual meeting is to connect feelings, exchange knowledge, discuss the society's affairs, and research engineering. It is of great significance for consolidating the foundation of the society and developing the future. Moreover, this year is the most serious time of national crisis, and the responsibility borne by our engineering colleagues is even greater. In other words, whether the nation and the country can survive in the future depends on whether our engineering colleagues can struggle to make a difference. Therefore, it is clear that this year's annual meeting should be expanded, and all members should participate. The colleagues who have been entrusted to prepare for the annual meeting have a short time but a deep wish. Remembering the meaning of 'every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the world', we strive to make this meeting the basis for the revival of China. From the position of the host, we should do our best to seek convenience for the members attending the meeting. Since the merger of this society, the number of members attending the meeting has increased year by year, which shows the spirit of unity of this society. Generally speaking, it depends on the enthusiastic participation of all members to naturally develop the society's affairs and improve engineering. Wuhan is the economic center of central China, with convenient transportation in all directions. In recent years, the construction of water conservancy and the development of roads have been remarkable. In terms of factories, there is the Hanyang Arsenal, which is large in scale. In terms of schools, Wuhan University has excellent scenery and is the crown of national universities. In addition, there are many places of interest. This year, there will also be tours to Changsha and Daye. The colleagues are modest and eager to welcome the distinguished guests. We hope that all members will be inspired by the news and participate in this grand event."</p>

<p>Davis Cup Inter-zone Finals: The United States is Greatly Disappointed: Two Singles Matches Lost, Britain Leads Two to Zero, Austin Beats Baines, Panley Beats Allison (Reuters, Paris, 21st)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Britain gained a very good position on the first day of the Davis Cup Inter-zone Finals. Both singles matches won against the United States. Austin first defeated Baines, and Panley then defeated Allison. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Austin (Britain) 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 Baines (United States)</p>

<p>Austin Defeats Baines: From the First Set Today, British expatriates in Paris came to watch Austin's success, which was previously considered impossible. In the hot sun, Baines attacked vigorously and won the first game. Austin, wearing a cap and shorts, returned to win a game with a close-range return to Baines' backhand. Austin's angled close shots were very impressive, forcing Baines to go to the net and then passing it with a sideline ball. In the third game, Austin tried his best to deal with Baines's violent serve. After several ties, Austin won with a long shot. Baines has been unable to recover since then, repeatedly attacking the enemy with his whirlwind-style forehand, but he was flustered and lost four consecutive games.</p>
<p>Second Set: From the second set, Austin had greater confidence and attacked with consecutive error-free shots, winning the first game. Baines only saw a brief revival, winning consecutive serves, making it 1-1. Baines wanted to restore his old speed, but failed again, making unforgivable mistakes and serving many double faults. Austin won five consecutive games.</p>
<p>Third Set: Austin broke Baines' serve first and won the first game. At this time, Baines gave up his heavy shots and tried high balls, winning two consecutive games, but Austin took a 3-2 lead again. At 5-3, Austin gave up the ninth game and won the next game, then won the third set with 6-4.</p>
<p>Panley Defeats Allison: First Set: Panley won the first set with better pressing, finishing in just ten minutes.</p>
<p>Second Set: In the second set, Allison's shots were more cunning, his pressing was more confident, and his hitting was more brilliant. Panley touched the net from time to time. Allison took a 3-1, 4-2 lead, but after both sides attacked each other's backhand, it became 5-5. Panley won two consecutive games with his skillful aerial pressure.</p>
<p>Third Set: In the third set, Panley's ball speed slowed down, relying on his irresistible kill shots. Pan took a 3-1 lead, followed by a 4-4 tie. After that, he won two more games and won.</p>
<p>New York Received the News and was Greatly Shocked: (Havas News Agency, New York, 21st)</p>
<p>The results of the first day of the Davis Cup Inter-zone Finals between British and American players near Paris were that American players Baines and Allison were defeated. It was previously expected that both of them would win, so they were extremely shocked to hear the news of the defeat.

<p>The Results of Yesterday's Xiansong Cup: There will still be six games today</p>
<p>The only Xiansong Cup Chinese Tennis League in the city will have twelve teams competing against each other again from 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Donghua team, which had finished playing football and played tennis, was eliminated. It was learned that the group between China and Railway, which was originally scheduled to be held at the China Tennis Court, has been decided to be held at the Railway Tennis Court. I hope everyone will pay attention. The match between Meilu and Green Light is evenly matched, and there will be many exciting moments. It is difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>Today's Order: Team Name vs. Competition Tennis Court</p>
<p>Yukai vs. Youyi at the Yukai Tennis Court</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Datong at the Youyou Tennis Court</p>
<p>Meilu vs. Green Light at the Meilu Tennis Court</p>
<p>Shenyu vs. Chenguang at the Shenyu Tennis Court</p>
<p>Xiaguang vs. Feili at the Xiaguang Tennis Court</p>
<p>China vs. Railway at the Railway Tennis Court</p>
<p>Railway Beats Donghua... 14-1</p>
<p>Although Railway's strength is not as strong as Jin Zan in this competition, it is also as thick as steel. It defeated Donghua 14-1 yesterday, which is commendable. If they defeat China again today, the optimism of the future can be imagined.</p>
<p>(1) Guo Qida (Railway) beats Tu Kaiyuan (Donghua) 6-3, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>(2) Chen Naixin (Railway) beats Yang Renwei (Donghua) 6-1, 6-3, 6-3</p>

<p>(5) Luo Shengxian and Zhou Jianwen (Railway) beat Lu Zhongen and Chen Yutian (Donghua) 6-0, 2-6, 6-2</p>
<p>Shenyu Beats Youyi... 8-7</p>
<p>Shenyu is a skilled player for many years, with the spirit of a newborn calf not afraid of tigers. They won a point against Youyi yesterday, which was all hard-earned. With this spirit, they have high hopes to move forward bravely. The outstanding individuals are difficult to mark with glory, and they are also the best candidates for both offense and defense.</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Rongbiao (Shen) beats Shen Bogui (Yi) 7-5, 6-1, 8-6</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Rongcai (Shen) beats Mao Hongfa (Yi) 2-6, 6-2, 6-3</p>
<p>(3) Shen Bogui and Mao Hongfa (Yi) beat Zhang Rongcai and Zi Zhen (Shen) 6-2, 8-6, 3-6</p>

<p>(5) Shao Changling and Jin Xun (Shen) beat Shao Leping and Ye Jinmian (Yi) 12-16, 6-4, 4-6</p>
<p>Youyou Beats Meilu... 10-3</p>
<p>The game between Youyou and Meilu yesterday was slightly delayed due to rain, so the first doubles game was difficult to continue to the middle of the game due to the dim twilight. It is said that it has been agreed to continue the game the day after tomorrow (25th). Earlier, Youyou took a 10-3 advantage.</p>
<p>(1) Guo Yujie (You) beats Hu Qichang (Mei) 6-2, 7-5, 6-4</p>
<p>(2) Tang Yongchun (You) beats Hu Qizhuo (Mei) 6-3, 7-5, 6-4</p>

<p>Green Light Beats Fei Li... 11-3</p>
<p>Green Light's victory does not seem accidental. The second doubles game was also incomplete due to the lights on. Wang Wenzheng and Qian Wenbao (Green Light) fought against Wang Hong and Sun Chengbi (Fei Li). The strength of the first doubles was evenly matched, and it was difficult to distinguish the Xuan Li. Although Wang and Qian won with a straight three, the score was close. It was only a judgment of luck and misfortune.</p>
<p>(1) Wang Wenzheng (Green) beats Sun Chengbi (Fei) 6-1, 6-1, 6-1</p>

<p>(5) Shen Yongnian and Yuan Shilong (Green) beat Xia Hongshou and Wang Yudong (Fei) 7-5, 3-6, 9-7</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Poetry and Prophecy - Yu Ming</p>
<p>Prophecies are always poetry, and most poets are prophets. However, prophecies are just poetry, while poetry is often more accurate than prophecies.</p>
<p>For example, during the Xinhai Revolution, suddenly found...</p>
<p>"Holding ninety-nine steel knives, I will not stop until I have killed all the barbarians."</p>
<p>These few lines from Tui Bei Tu are just "poetry". At that time, there were not only ninety-nine steel knives, but also advanced guns and cannons... After all, the guns and cannons gained the upper hand, while those with only steel knives suffered greatly. Moreover, the "barbarians" at that time were not only not "killed", but also received preferential treatment, so that now there is still a day for the "puppet" Pu Yi to be in the limelight. So, as a prophecy, these few lines of song are actually not fulfilled. To rigidly follow such prophecies often leads to failure, just like some time ago, someone specially made ninety-nine steel knives and sent them to the soldiers at the front line. As a result, they only shed blood in places like Gubeikou, proving the irresistibility of national disasters. It is better to regard this kind of prophecy song as "poetry", and you can "understand its meaning and intention, and claim to have understood it".</p>
<p>As for poetry, there are indeed very profound prophecies. If we want to find prophecies, it is better to read the poet's collection of poems than to read Tui Bei Tu. Perhaps this year is also the time to discover something, and I actually found these few lines...</p>
<p>"These people are like wolves following mad dogs, hunting beasts all their lives, the anger of ten thousand people cannot be turned back, and I will see Taibai hanging their heads."</p>
<p>A Draft of Poems and Lyrics by Yishuang Zhaolou... Translation: "Warriors of the Second Year of the Russian 'Republic'".</p>
<p>How can this not make people "slap the table and applaud"? In this "sealing wolves and following mad dogs", they are clearly beasts themselves, but they treat people as beasts... Beasts hunt, but</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Communications Regarding the Cancellation of Toll Charges <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Communications, requesting the implementation of the cancellation of telephone toll charges in the Chinese district. The original text read: "To the esteemed Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, it has been noted that for telephone calls between the Chinese district and the concession in this city, a toll of five cents must be paid for every three minutes. This type of toll charge, where users within the same urban area must pay an additional fee per call on top of their monthly rental fee, is unprecedented. Users have tolerated this temporarily, assuming it was due to manual switchboard operation by the company, hence this expedient measure. Now that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has upgraded to automatic switching, on the one hand, the monthly rental fee has been increased, while on the other hand, the method of charging five cents per call has not been resolved. Imposing both measures simultaneously is extremely unfair. In other commercial ports with concessions, there is no such toll charge. Singling out Shanghai to bear this burden for an extended period is even more biased. Previously, when discussing this matter with the bureau, there was an indication of a willingness to make painful sacrifices, regardless of the situation in the concession area. However, as it concerns the Ministry's authority, it cannot be implemented without an order. We earnestly request the Ministry to consider the commercial situation; otherwise, the users' disappointment will deepen, and the dispute will be difficult to resolve quickly. We dare not fail to urgently submit this petition. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Exceptional Case of Land Bureau Surveying and Measuring the North Railway Station's Land Base <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Expenses to be Paid by the Railway Bureau Based on Actual Needs</p>
<p>Address to be Certified by the Land Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways issued an instruction to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, stating in brief: "Regarding the case of the said Administration surveying and measuring the land base of the North Railway Station, and requesting exemption from all fees, it was previously instructed that the railway should directly negotiate with the Shanghai Land Bureau for handling. The Ministry has also successively consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting them to instruct the Land Bureau to comply. Now, a reply has been received from the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating: 'Regarding the Shanghai Land Bureau's collection of fees for surveying and measuring the North Railway Station's land base, the expenses actually required by the Land Bureau's personnel for surveying the land plots of the North Railway Station are quite substantial. Considering the spirit of cooperation among colleagues, it is not appropriate to have them fully cover the expenses. Regarding this point, it is proposed that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau should appropriately remit the actually required expenses to conclude the matter. As for the land ownership certificate, to avoid future disputes and to facilitate inspection at any time, a land certificate should be issued separately from the topographical map, as there is no basis for acceptance without it. We request you to instruct the Land Bureau to issue said land certificate to ensure thoroughness.' Accordingly, in addition to instructing the Land Bureau to directly contact the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau for handling and reporting, a corresponding consultation reply is to be sent for reference to the Ministry. It is ordered that you comply and directly contact the Shanghai Land Bureau for handling nearby and report for record and verification." After receiving the order, the said Railway Administration has already instructed the land section to dispatch personnel to the Land Bureau to negotiate and handle the matter.</p>
