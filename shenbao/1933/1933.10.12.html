<h3 id="c23">編製地方預算應顧及人民負擔能力　　仁 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>週前（六日）立法院第三十三次會議。通過「編製地方預算應行注意事項」十條。對於目前地方預算之弊。及所以改進之道。言之極爲剴切。就中尤以第四條之編造預算應顧及人民負担能力。最爲中肯。在財政紊亂國困民窮之今日。吾人亦僉以顧及人民負担能力。實爲目前整理地方財政上之急圖。「竭澤而漁焚藪而畋。」其結局必將有公私交匱之一日。而財政亦將莫可整理矣。</p>
<p>顧我國地方之苛捐雜税。近年以來。日益加甚。疊牀架屋名目繁多。即如河南一省。據往日該省財廳之報告。大小雜捐。已達七十餘種川滇邊地稅捐之繁重。更有甚於吾人意想之外者。姑舉成渝道上徵捐現狀而論。沿途關卡林立由重慶購買雜貨一百元。取道小川北運往成都。途程僅八百二十里。而統計税捐。約在一百元左右。平均每隔八里。徵税十元。此爲最特著之例子。此外各省田賦預徵至數年成數十年。附加税超出正税之二三倍至七八倍。則又爲普遍之現象也。今日各地層出不窮之捐税名目。如國難捐與救國捐或剿匪捐等。雖未必盡用於實際。然尙較冠冕可説。至其名目巧立。如四川之鄧公祠印花税及懶捐（不種鴉片之罰欵）或迷信捐等。則更名目離奇。貽笑中外矣。各地除捐税以外。尙有種種公債之分派。庫券之攤募。主辦者固依據合理之原則。執行者殊難免苛索以病民。欲求與人民負担能力相稱。蓋亦戞戞乎其難之。</p>
<p>凡此種種。俱爲今日地方財政收入之狀况。然而反顧其支出情形。則省内建設之進行遲滯。教育經費亦拖欠日久。所聞所見者。大都爲令人痛心之事。據中行月刋中所載。統計去年各省發行之公債。其百分之四十一有奇爲購備軍火。其百分之二十一有奇爲整理財政及彌補軍費。而其爲地方事業資金者。僅百分之一耳。收入之情形旣如彼。而支出之情形又如此。我今日地方財政之不健全。誠莫可諱言矣。　　近年來我國各省之預算。什九爲入不數支即在預算表面上保持收支平衡之數省。其實際亦不過徒以虚收實支之方法。隠蔽其不數情狀而已。故今日而欲言編造預算。應顧及人民負擔能力。其先决條件。即應自緊縮地方支出入手。裁駢枝之機關。减不急之經費。努力於生産事業之發展。節各種一不生産之消費。勵官吏之廉隅。則財政支出可以减少。而收入之徵取。亦可與人民負擔能力相稱。民困或有稍蘇之望乎。</p>
<p>在今日之中國。極目滔滔。四境荒凉。農村旣破産。而工商又凋敝。此種情狀之造成。地方收入之不能顧及人民負擔能力。或亦爲其重要之一。因今後各省果能依照中央之方針。最入爲出。努力於合理預算之編造。而一改往日之舊弊。則亡羊補牢。未爲晚也。古語云。「財聚則民散。財散則民聚。」又云。「不患寡而患不均。不患貧而患不安。」今後我地方之理財者。其三味斯言。</p>

<p>（東京）　觀最近高橋藏相及荒木陸相所發表之言論、日本之獨裁政府似正在醖釀中、其中以軍部人員爲其主動、高橋宣稱、如目前之事件仍邁進不已、則恐日本將變成獨裁政體、爲謀完成國防起見、財政之整理或竟將被犠牲、陸相荒木稱、在未來之三個月中、日本將有大變動、余預料各方面之激變、必將令人驚訝云、藏相現因國防計畫之費用與海陸兩界中人爭執頗烈、因陸軍明年之預算、爲六八○·○○○·○○○日金而海軍則爲五六○·○○○·○○○日金、此數幾已佔全國税收之全部、其預算不敷之數將達一·○○○·○○○·○○○日金、陸軍方面人員、多願效法意大利或蘇俄、解散現在政黨、而以一黨專政、因此日本之獨裁醞釀、更形活動云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　五相會議本日午後續開、依國際恊調主義以外交手段爲主之高橋廣田兩相之意見、及以目下狀勢應有處最惡時之準備之軍部意見、變方依然對立、陸軍方面以自由主義外交之成效、早已證明無力、帝國之國際環境、不僅外交所能解决、故須先行國土防衛之準備、然後發揮外交手腕、其所要之軍事費、僅將延期之繼續費一齊支出、乃竟拒絶、殊爲認識不足、故均支持荒木陸相之見解、荒木陸相已在不能讓步之立塲、一面高橋廣田兩相之意見、爲多數閣員所支持、荒木陸相雖希望不以本問題影響於内閣之存立、然大勢所趨、無可如何、視五相會議之結果、或左或右、内閣無論矣、且將决定帝國之進路、故極被重視、（十日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　五相會議尙未發見一致點、今後將更行恊議、軍部方面對會議之進行遲滯、感多大之不满昨日會議後、荒木陸相對新聞記者發表談話云、今日會議係繼續前次之恊議、並無何等决定、循此以往、會議何時可畢、未能預料、會議如不能圓满進行、或不能成立妥恊、雖可由首相下裁斷解决、然此次之問題乃决定將來日本應進行之大方針、故無論如何、完全之會議、實爲必要、聞某某方面、專對付陸軍、且爲分裂軍部之意見起見、有在會議背後暗中飛躍之説、此事雖未得到確報、倘果係事實、余將捨身决切行之……云、（十一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　五相會議於今日下午二時在首相官邸繼續開會、荒木陸相陳述國際形勢之急迫、并高聲力主謂、軍事費之膨脹、係絶對必要云云、惟廣田外相之主張、謂國際形勢之急迫、固係事實、但現尙有用外交的技術之餘地、此時當然係運用外交技術之時期、故最惡之設想、時期尙早云、高橋藏相又維持外相之主張、致兩者間之意見、未能一致、但未涉及預算問題、於下午五時散會、下次會議因星期五、係荒木陸相在旅行中、星期六又係神嘗祭、故續議期預定十六日或十八日、（十日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　據官方消息、昨日之五相會議、軍財兩部之意見甚接近、荒木陸相謂、軍部並不反對外交部之和平工作、不過和平政策有一定之限度、超過此種限度之工作、應有十足之武力爲其後盾、始能得到相當之效果、站在此種立塲、軍部爲欲擁護满洲及南洋之生命線、擁護旣得權益、防衛國土、保護七千萬日本人之性命財産、均要有十足之武力、對於軍部之主張　廣田及高橋亦承認其原則、故下屆之五相會議、當有相當之展開云、（十一日華聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c199">對於中央體育塲建築方面之批評 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 吳藴瑞</p>
<p>我在下筆之前、第一要聲明的、就是我對於設計者、索不相識、我對他毫無成見、不過爲學術研究起見、不能不加批評、車　之處、請建築者原諒、此塲離城市太遠、現在凡到塲參觀者、莫不有批評、實際上作者在三年前設計建築之時、時在報端發表反對之意見、　之者定尙能憶得、當時九一八事變未起、國家情形較好、政府有建政府辦公廳於中山陵旁之計劃、　在陵之南建築、確是遠大計劃、不料政府與開　之戰、國家元氣大傷、因之以九一八之變、政府辦建於中山陵之旁之計劃、無法實現、於是一偉大之體育塲不得不孤立於中山陵之前、此係時局爲之　非政府當局所能負責、亦實非建築者所能負責、今木已成舟、離城太遠、來往不便之弊、亦不必多責矣、此次全運會籌備期中、作者以副總幹事之資格、兼塲地設備股股長、前後到塲勘察監工、共一月有零之久、故對於塲之利弊得失與歴來對於體育建築及設備、研究心得相對照、頗有不能已於言之處、爰　條分論之、</p>
<h3 id="c200">田徑運動塲 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>一、看臺所佔之地平面太大</p>
<p>看臺之目的、在使參觀者對於所看之各種運動項目看得清楚、若坐臺上而對各項運動看不清楚、則看臺是廢物、跑圈若過六百米、則看臺上之人對於各項運動、無法看清故有人主建八百米之跑道者、實未明瞭此道也、中央體育塲之跑道爲五百米、已屬不小、（照例爲四百米）卽看臺靠緊跑道而築、塲中各項目已覺不能一一看清、今乃於跑圏曲段之兩端外、各設籃球（或排球塲）塲四個、於是看臺在兩曲段之座上、對於田徑項目、無法看清楚矣、兩曲段之看臺、對於田徑運動是同虚設、太不經濟、况籃球場排球塲在田徑塲之外、各有專門之建築、在看臺曲段内之八場、此次用到者、不過一塲耳、其他八塲、是同虚設、夫田徑運動建築之費、大部份費之於看臺、今因建無用之球塲、於看臺内致費去大宗之金錢、於無用之看臺、虚耗國幣、可惜此塲建築時惜已離京起瀋、否則計劃初定之時、必在報端大加批評、而希圖有國家之經費也、</p>
<p>二、跑道不論直段或曲段均太寛按德國體育建築專家地姆（Ｄｉｅｍ）博士之主張跑道之直段、以七米二（六路段路一米二）爲率、因百米二百米之成績日有進步、以後第一與第二第二與第三之相差、恐有一二糎以内者、若一起所跑之人太多、終點裁判員十分困難、中央體育塲之直段及曲段之北端者、皆爲十五米、此種寛度一起可容十二人、推猜設計者之意、大槪以爲如此闊法、可使百米二百米四百米四百米中欄段起可有十二人跑、可節省豫賽複之次數、不知節省豫賽複之次數一事、評判又是一事、今將四百米中欄一項來説、一監察員大槪管看一或二横行、倘一横行有十二欄、則十二跳者前後蜂、</p>
<p>而來、犯規者不易看清、在曲段之欄、前後參差不齊、欄愈多、則視線愈廣、犯規愈不容易看清况最新之規則、脚或腿微撞欄而搖動、、卽作爲撞倒論、評判更須精明、一起有十二人、則監察員難於看清、故十五米之跑道、不免失之過寛大然因跑道之寛看臺之範圍不能不大、建築又費金錢、故從跑道方面論、亦使建築不經濟、</p>
<p>三、全塲中所有跳道與跑道均比兩旁之地爲低是建築上之大錯誤　　田徑運動場内、最緊要之物爲跑道與跳道、而建築方面之最宜注意者、爲道上之出水問題、因雨後跑道與姚道上之水、可以速速流去、天公放晴、不能繼續運動也、今中央運動塲上之跳道與跑道、皆比兩旁之地爲低、於是下雨之時、所有之水、皆匯集於跳道與跑道之上、豈非大謬、今出水洞之口、皆比跑道爲低、不知設計之用意如何、作者不能瞭解、</p>
<p>四、塲内田徑項目所佈置之地位不合法、</p>
<p>照合法之配置田賽中之擲鐵餅一項之鐵圏、莫不置跑道屈段内之中央、因鐵餅擲出之方向、能在一百八度之内向各方發射、有時有訓練之老手、亦不絶脱手而從横圖射者、若鐵餅圈不置中央而偏放於屈段内之邊、於鐵餅有擲入跪道上之危險、今此南曲段中央設一跳高區城、將鐵餅之地位佔據、鐵餅不得不設於靠近跑道之一邊、危險百出、可豫期也、一方跳高時之跑之距、離不大、扇形跳道可置曲段内之兩側、今偏置中央、妨碍鐵餅之地位、可云計劃毫無、</p>
<p>五、砂坑太深而太短三級跳遠之跳道太短砂坑内之砂面與跳板不平、</p>
<p>砂坑不能太深、深則跳者落入坑之時、向下流太多、成績之損失必大、故砂坑之深自二尺至二尺半爲度、跳遠坑太短、跳者咸具戒心、足令成减色、三級跳遠之跑道、　距砂坑有四十五米之多、今此塲所有者不過三十五米左右、减去跳板距砂坑間之距離十一米之餘、祇有二十五米左右矣、在此距離之内、無法使跳者跑之速度加至最大之程度、故此次在開會之先、將跳道增長十米、原來之砂坑内之砂面比跳道低、四五吋之多、此與成績有關係、蓋砂坑内之沙面愈低、所跳之成績比其應有之成績愈高、砂面之比跳道之面高起愈多、則所跳之成績比其應有之成績愈低、砂面之太高或太低者、皆足以使成績不正確、此次之砂坑之周圍木邊、原嫌太低、均一一升高四五吋、使砂面亦升四五吋、</p>
<p>除以上諸缺點之外、尙有他種、如棒球塲之太小足球場之無出路、與其看臺之與球場間之無間隔等、限於　幅、不遑詳評、吾望設計諸君、经後多參考中外體育建築書籍、勿使同樣錯誤、復發現於他塲也、</p>

<p>自由談説建築　  林微音　　　中國人是一種最容易進取的人，也是凡事都容易得到圓滿的成功的人。比如，就以建築爲例，它的從舊的方法轉移到新的方法還没有經過多少時候，却已輕易地臨到了它的最高點，已在使人對於它感到了厭倦。　　旣然感到了厭倦，你便不能找求一些新的剌激，你覺得舊的建築實在好，看着旣順眼，住着又閒散，可是你不能那様説出來，因爲那様説了怕人家會説你開倒車。於是你轉折地説··舊的建築果然該廢除。那琉璃瓦却是値得保留的。在事實上·你知道，有許多鋼骨水泥的建築是在用着琉璃瓦，可是没有人那様主張過··你那様主張了，使得人家看到那新　兩種材料的合用，就會想起那是成就自你的建議。而在你的底裏呢·你還會有一個眞切的希冀，希冀　琉璃瓦下的鋼骨和水泥依舊换做土磚和水灰。　　或者你以爲新的建築所以要建築得縝密，　精緻，僅爲了要向舊的建築示威，就是意思在説舊的建築所能做到的新的建築也未始做不到，因爲舊的建築是很縝密，很精緻的。可是你覺得那示威期已過，而且你相信新的建築也已夠縝密，夠精緻了的，不該再儘這様縝密，精緻下去。而現在所要的該是刀，該是槍。整個都會是粗暴。隨處是炸彈，只要你向它輕微一碰，你就會有被它炸死之虞。要不這様，那容忍着縝密與精緻的建築是會有危險的。因爲它會有麻醉性。你會被它麻醉到死而還不自知。你看到了這一切，你便忍無可忍地提出了個要建築再轉换一個新的方向的警告。　　中國人是一種最容易進取的人，眼見隔不久就會有一種更新的建築的完成。國病　  高植　　　　自已病在床上，天天被國醫與國藥閙得頭昏了，靜中胡想，彷彿若有所悟。人的身體會有病，國家也會有病。中國曾被人呌作「東亞病夫」其爲有病，更屬無疑。國家有病，那未這病自當呌國病　　中國的國病究竟是什麽呢？這裏且不作定論，只把我個人的意見説一説。或説國病是懶，或説國病是民族衰老，然而這都似乎説得太抽象了。中國以農立國，官懶是眞，農民却是大家認爲最勤的。按生物的觀點看來，民族是不會衰老的。　　照在定縣從事平民教育運動的人看，中國人民的（也就是中國的）四大病是愚，貧，弱，私。這是説全國百分之八十以上的人口是文盲，有的窮得連飯也没得吃，而且體格不强，不知道衛生，公民的訓練一點也説不上，人人只知道私，不知道公。　　自辛亥革命以來，已有二十二個年頭。關於「愚」，不是有教育部在那裏教育民衆麽？關於「弱」，衛牛部（署）已設立有年了，更加國　提倡得十分熱閙，不久人人都會身强力壯，不吸雅片，而且還可藉念經打坐鍜鍊精神，爲國家祈福消災丨至於窮，不是政府發行過多少萬萬内外債麽？正在作建設事業啦，而且棉麥借欵又來了，而且又要發行什麽什麽庫劵了，而全還有航空獎劵，給人人有得五十萬元的　會，政府只要總收入的一半、可是這些錢呢？四病治了嗎？　　這又要牽涉到「私」的問題上去了。一般民衆爲衣食的私算不得病。爲一般民衆的「公僕」的人的私才眞是病。國體的强弱固在乎人民力量的水凖，可是首領的領導與負責是盛衰的先决條件。日本在明治維新前是什麽樣子？意大利和德意志在十九世紀六十年代之前是什麽樣子？蘇俄在十五年之内成了什麽樣子以前是什麽樣子？把一切的不好諉諸民衆的首領是低能而可恥的。然而首領們是有權的，有權便可行私。大官或大軍閥一私，便幾十萬幾百萬人民窮死餓死。公債内債庫劵等等越來越多，人民越苦，而國病也越難有起色了。也許這就是國病吧？　　人病了，還有國醫藥可以對付·，國病了，便該怎樣呢？整書續記　　  唐弢　　　　　驀然一個念頭飛進我腦際，「整書丨」　　可也眞難。這些裏面旣有皇帝陛下，又有革命先烈，詩人哥兒，無一不齊。整來煞是費事。如果引用先朝儀制，早幾年是判逆，到現在又日漢奸，罪名雙重，不是玩的丨但萬一不冠不履，不戴上紳士老閶的面具，隨隨便便來一下，詩人曰··（這是跑龍套丨）　　我在先也曾跟着老二，出入聖賢之門·周游詩禮之邦，聽他們歌頌六經，提倡八德，把個先帝爺捧得天樣高，心裏老大不快丨後來感於老莊，覺得萬事到頭都空，頗想騎匹青牛·出函谷關去。　　然而終於没有辦到。　　這在替愛　好文章的人們想起來，却是幸事。因爲如果眞的仙去，使紳士們少了個誣詈的對象，因而埋没名文，豈不可惜丨　　道德經和莊子，從此决意不讀，把牠們放進書架的夾　裏去。　　但晋人的小品和短　，却是我生平愛　的··原因是念上口來，總覺清新可喜，絶不會像現代流行的那些「馬路巡禮」「ＸＸ交響曲」那樣，一面看，一面非吃阿司必靈不可丨　　此藥房老關，所以必靈必靈的大　其冒牌化貨也。　　旁著晋人的小品，我把元曲放上去。　　　接著是十幾部全集。裏面有「ＸＸ文存」，據説是聖人遺著。半世沐猴，百年冠狗，悲夫悲夫丨　　詩詞新舊放在一起。新的未加著試，舊的呢？此調也久矣夫不彈了。横緊古有才子佳人，今有公子哥兒，他們自已會去訂交，不勞我多嘴。　　小説在各書裏最多，尤其是蟹行的洋文。我把來一一整她了。本來還想説幾句，但據説文章以少寫爲妙，至於碰著别人痛處，尤在嚴禁之列。　　就此帶住。並祝舉世同文，勿患歇斯的理症丨澉浦通信　　（三）　　  阿英○○兄··　　　爲着特殊的原因，十八日回到上海，二十日又第二次來到澉浦了。事情還没有完全弄好，立刻走到鹽民間去還不可能。聞着無聊，雅人興發，我們便結合了幾個人去游山了。在這個時候，我也來做雅人，這眞如百齡機的廣告，有些意想不到。但是，雅人到抵是做了。我就報告這一天的雅給你，來作爲「澉浦通信」的枝插曲吧。　　這一回的出游，連我一共是五個人。上午十點半鐘，從所居的萬蒼山出發，過大湖山，山上松樹極多。山下有石橋，有溪流，稻已黄，香味撲鼻。沿溪西行，到民初浙督朱瑞的墓地；石人之一的鬍子大有仁丹鬍子的風味，由此可見，活人固然歡喜聯日，就是死人，也頗有與日爲榮的意思，爲之感慨不盡。墓後　朱庵，一跨㵎築　，大殿前㵎水横流而過，想大雨而後，其勢甚雄，惜乎此特彷彿民窮財盡，已是乾涸了。㵎上有橋，直還大殿，我非佛門弟子，不知所供奉者究竟爲誰？坐洞旁吃茶，看　㵎搭成的葡萄架，以至沿屋的蔦蘿，紅花·詩興有點勃發，但想到離開了七年的在故鄉父親手植的葡萄，　夫先生寫「　蘿行」時的悲哀心境，我的詩情，却被打下十八層地狱了。特，還是讓我們高臥的志摩去繼續專利吧　　十一點十分，出朱庵，沿㵎而上大旗山。因石爲級，約四百步，　徐忠　公墓，　猶未盡也。閉目凝思，　大雨之後來此，看山洪澎湃，水花四濺，定是大觀，深爲咒詛老天昨日爲何不來一回傾盆大雨。看神道牌，知道這徐忠　公（名用儀，字吉甫，號小云，海鹽人）在庚子年代，是一個反帝的人，而也就因反帝而被殺。我想這個墓的建立是比朱墓有意思多了，難怪在他墓前的石人嘴上没有仁丹或如電影上常有的翹捲起來的鬍子呢。我們肅然起敬，看了很久。以後，經山　村，翻陸家嶺，到嶺下的竹林。太陽本已晒得頭痛，　然得到一個萬竿竹林，走在裏面，眞是凉適極了，而况有那蕭蕭地音樂的聲音。上去，就是談仙嶺，沿路的石道，據説是譚仙一夜築成，石頭下面，全是金塊。夢想發財，本已可笑，知有金而不去掘，只放在口裏講講，尤爲奇突，好在皇天后土，知道我並不想發財，也就不　他的娘了。沿山又有一道㵎水，㵎中有一個突起的圓凹，據説，這是談仙洗澡的地方，卽使上下水斷此處終不會竭，並且水可醫瘡，人能作證。水裏有琉璜質可以醫瘡，這是當然，終年不竭，未免是一奇蹪。因此，這一天游事旣畢，復約了兩位朋友跑去沐浴。這一次的澡，洗得確實比上海的温泉　意。遺憾是，這天然浴缸裏的終年不竭的水，經我們三人不到十分鐘的努力，已經傾得見底了··兩位朋友依舊不甘心，用手巾連餘瀝也都沾了出去。談仙有知，我想定然要大呼晦氣；仙人遺跡，也有折穿西洋景的時候，涉想及此，不禁爲之一快！可是我的通信，也就不能不在這「一快」的當兒，作中途的結束了。○○兄，明天再談吧。　　　　　　　阿英　八月二十一晚廬山志序　　　  章太炎　　余友吳宗慈藹林·爲廬山志十二卷·義寗陳　序之·舉目錄詳矣。復求序　余，余曰；内則棲逸民，外則容桑門者，古之廬山也。以巖穴虎駔僧，以灌莽起華屋者，今之廬山也。中國名山數十，自五　及終南，青城，點蒼，峨眉，近道有黄山，括蒼，其地或僻左，或當孔道，而船航不得至。獨廬山枕大江·蕃客俗士所易竀·欲隱於其地者，，固地勢然也。雖然，自今而往，山日槎，市日廓，欲隠於其地者，非高　則不能忆已。人之情、求不獲，無足悲··求隱而不得其地以竄者，母亦天下之至哀歟？藹林負俗之士也，襲以議員走南北幾十年·不得言而去·其後未　爲不義屈，常居是山，期與昏狂相遠，其自重若斯之　也。所爲志　笮巖去華，於昔之勝迹，今之變故詳矣。山政一卷，尤質實足以備故事·其情之韙非不可知，要之，今之廬山必與藹林所期者稍遠矣。吾乃知天之鼓物果不與聖人同愛樂也。題其耑云爾。民國二十一年九月，章炳麟。戀之一頁丨丨快點兒吧。不然你就要戀冷啦！　　馬鈴薯有點臭　盡是水份，剥着馬鈴皮薯的　的手指，染上民臭汁。聞着這雙手的味道都使人不高興。但瑪麗是一個好脾氣的女兒·她總能忍耐過馬鈴薯的麽練；因爲在她的全身裡是漲着色彩，年青和健康的氣氛。當她剥完了馬鈴薯的皮又自由起來的時候·安利簡直再也忍耐不住了。他抱住了這個女兒。她説··——不要閙笑話喲！　　除此她什麽也没的有請。她沈點着了。她再没有什麽工作了。時期已經成熟了。安利在這女兒的唇角上·覺着有發　的　道，而且看見了一個痣。這時·傳來打開大門的聲音·幸而從大門到廚房來的門是關着。瑪麗小聲地説··——老爺回來啦！　　這時不能躊躇了。然而就這樣跑掉是怎麽也不能夠的。安利不曉得隨便跑進人家的家裡是該有什麽罪過的。縱有殺頭的罪過也認命了。有一個避難法是給了他·那是瑪麗的提議，他不管三七二十一只有答應了。　　廚房的角上，有一間暗室，可以放得下一個木櫃那麽大，平常是裝髒東西的地方。他没有辦法只得跑到那裡邊去了。　　他在裡邊呆了有多少天哪？在好久之後他才明白他不過才呆了一點多鐘。停了一會兒·瑪麗來呌他·説李柴先生已經出門了，這時·他隨便怎樣作都可以了，但他却只想逃走。他走過這女兒的身邊看了她一眼。她的眼睛是大而呆笨的。使人覺得無論怎樣長久地望着兩雙眼，也不會發見什麽表情的。她是有着多麽愚蠢樣子·縱算她有無論怎樣美麗的頰，人家也不會注意到了。她胖胖地有了小皺紋，而且手指像腫起來了似的。像她這種樣子的馬鈴薯也是有着很多的。她和牝牛只是在形態上有着差異。她發着家畜的小　的氣味。　（完）</p>

<p>春秋溥奶奶哭濕百鮫綃　  瞻廬　　紅顔宫女談廢宫瑣事之一　　李桂貞女十曾在廢帝丨溥儀舉行大婚時，被選入宫充侍女；其時，年僅十齡，卽在紫禁城中度宫女生活。越三戰，基督將軍回師故都·卽派鹿鍾麟福逐溥儀出宫，伊亦在遣散之列；才得重返家庭，對於廢宫瑣事，頗有群細的紀述。今歲·女十芳齡，將近花信，人物亦殊摩豐，某報記者欲知溥儀被逐前的宫闈狀况，往訪女士，縱談之下，遂得知宫中的一鱗一爪。女十所述的故宫經過，足資談助，選擇其較有趣味者，以經濟的語體文記載其二事，一，爲「溥奶奶哭濕百鮫綃」，槪略如左··　　榮后丨溥奶奶在午後到養性殿去閑逛，經過箭道，遇見了溥儀拳養的洋狗佛克一，伊也是喜玩狗的，便蹲在箭道獲逗弄「佛克」。同時，溥儀的竉愛内監汪玉祥，急於要往箭道夷去取東西·並没有請正宫主子「註一」讓過一旁，竟從伊身上　了過去。溥奶奶以爲内監瞧不起伊，默默的跑回儲秀宫，竟倒在龍牀上哭得一佛出世·二佛升天。　　皇后一哭，嚇煞了多少人，嚇得内監們，四種媽媽們，六雲六霞宫女們，「註一」黑壓壓的跪滿了儲秀宫，啟問老爺子何事悲哀？伊不肯直説，只是儘量的哭，哭濕了一方鮫綃，又换一方，一共哭濕了一百多方鮫綃。經過一晝夜的哭，跪在地上的人，也陪着伊哭，陪着伊不吃不喝，幾乎把储儲秀宫淌成了一條淚河。後來没余何，只得奏明溥儀，由溥儀寫了一封英文信，遗从送去，伊看了，扯爲粉碎，哭仍不停。直待溥儀第二次慰問晝來，伊才揮淚答了一信，説明原委；溥儀敷衍伊的面子，處分了汪内監，哭風潮方才平靖。　　榮后丨溥奶奶是滿清的貴族女子，又擁着皇后的　榮，當然受不起委屈，一哭便濕了百鮫綃；但現在日人監視下做一位傀儡式的執政奶奶，只怕委屈更多吧，不知伊近來揩濕了多少鮫綃？　　「註」宫中稱正宫皇后爲主子，或老爺子。　　「註二」四種媽媽，一，經起媽媽，卽多年媽子；姆姆媽媽，卽乳媽；三漿洗媽媽；四，梳頭媽媽。溥奶奶所用十二名宫女，六名取雲爲名，六名取霞爲名，謂之六雲六霞；李桂貞在宫女時代，取名「婉霞」。慶與弔　  君惕　遇着喜事，便熱烈的慶祝；遇着喪事，便沉痛的哀悼··都是人之常情，也是常禮。假使遇着喪事的日子多，而遇着喜事的日子少，這熱烈的慶祝，就會被沉痛的哀悼打銷。誰都知道，十月十日是我國的國慶紀念日，是一年中最光榮的一日。自民國十九年向上數，遇到這一天，總要舉行一次盛大的慶祝，雖不如法國那樣發狂，也算是很熱烈的了；但自民國十年往下數，遇到這一天，不舉行過一次紀念，就算完了。這就是因爲國恥，國難，國喪的紀念日，比國慶的紀念日，多而又多，那得意的慶祝，究竟敵不住失意的哀痛。我且將最大的各種紀念日，寫出來做個比較。　　一年中除去二月外，每月都有紀念日··一月一日，是中華民國成立紀念日；一月一十八日，是上海之戰紀念日；三月十二日，是總理逝世紀念日；三月一十九日，是七十二烈上殉國紀念日；四月十八日，是國民政府建都南京紀念日；五月三日，是濟南慘案紀念日；五月九日，是廿一條約國恥紀念日；五月卅日，是上海慘案國恥紀念日；六月廿二日，是沙基慘案國恥紀念日；七月一日，是國民政府成立紀念日；八月二十九日，是南京和約國恥紀念日；九月七日，是辛丑條約國恥紀念日；九月十八日，是滿洲淪亡，最大之國恥紀念日；十月十日，是國慶紀念日；十一月十二日，是總理誕辰紀念日；十二月二十五日，是雲南起義紀念日。　　算起來一共十六個紀念日，只有五個是可慶的，而其餘都是最悲痛的。所以每個月都可看到國旗掛在旗桿上；可是扯到一半的時候多，扯到頂的時候少。長此以往，也許天天會下半旗，也許國慶日會下半旗，但是誰希望這種地步？　　我們在不得不慶而無精打采去慶的十月十日，應當打疊起整個精神，和這野蠻世界來幹一下。我敢料得定，現在的國恥，國難紀念日，就是將來的國慶紀念日；現在國旗扯一半的那天，也就是將來扯到頂的那一天。探春　  宣閣　　　　胡健生君與張瑞芬女士。於雙十節皆好賦此賀之。　　葉艶霜紅，菱喧波冷，秋到味純圓路、舊約盟鸛，新詞酬月，一舸剡中來去，試問苧蘿雲，怎似得江南烟雨，幾時重泛梁溪，比　人羨鄉土·應有催妝詩句·恐隔院人多，歌傅黄浦·金鴨氳氳·鏡戀璀璨，莫遣夜凉深注·明日珠　下·還記取張家眉嫵·越水清音，冰　猶自雙譜·東北四連長　  張恨水　第十六回　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍　　在連長們這様想着，臉上當然都有一種很不自在的神氣表現了出來。三個營長，自然是看見了，向他們各望了一望，有一種暗示，告訴已知道了他們的意思所在而已。趙自强的營長實芳，臉色一正，就站起來了。他望了團長道··營長不能不給弟兄們説幾句話。我們在西苑駐了這些日子，各連自已，少不得和商家，都有賒欠賬目。一個有要動身出們，那裏就不要辦些應用的東西。單就這一連的鉛筆紙張説，在行軍的時候，不見是買得到，總也要預備幾塊錢的。别的就不必提了，團長一定可以想得到。團長道··你們説的，我也知道，只是上面没有答應給我錢·多了我怎墊得出來别個營長，見團長没有答應的意思，也站起來訴了一番苦。、　論了三十分鐘之久，團長才答應每連增加十塊錢。大家料着是再無什麽希望了，也就只好拉倒，散了會以後各個連長都奔回自已的連部。趙自强立刻也召集本連官長，傳連團長的然後就命令司務長算清本連對内對外的賬目，呌上士清理圖表。兩個人共同檢點武器庫理的東西，呌三個排長，各歸束各排的大小行李。又説··統共只四十八小時的工夫，除了兩個整晚上要睡覺而外，這一天；又去了兩小時，實際上只有二十二小時，大家都只好忙一點。至於各排長短少零錢用，可以借一點，但是過了三塊錢就不好辦。各排長誰也料不到一點風聲不露，忽然要開拔起來。從來開拔的時候，收束整個星期，也不算費多了時候，現在只一天多的工夫，就要開拔了，誰也有點私事，這樣看起來，都是如何可以料理。大家當了面，這也不好説什麽，各自回排去辦事去了。趙自强明知道排長不會滿意，可是上面，就是這樣吩咐下來的，當連長的人，有什麽法子呢？（二一○）擇隣　  愼言　　小時候，讀到「孟母三遷」的一課晝，雖然講晝的先生是出其全力的把孟老太太歌頌着，贊美着，然而在我們那一羣小朋友的心上，却誰也不曾向她表示過同情，充其量，也祇覺得這位孟老太太比普通所見的那些老太婆似乎更多事些，更厲害些而已。　　後來，人生的經騐漸漸地增加了，當時一班不擁護孟老太太的叛徒竟逐一反正了，大家都感覺到和歹人所做隣居，不但有影響兒童教育的遠慮，而且還有不能安居的近痛咧。於是擇隣一章，也和「愼交」，「訓子」，等重大事件，同列於個人處世眞詮之中了，説實話，兄弟便是如此。可是，其因我把孟老太太的主義奉行得太認眞的緣故，現在幾乎弄得無地宿身了。　　其實我所言的擇隣條件也並不像孟老太太那樣的嚴格，因爲我已經確切地明瞭要使一個在上海這地方長大的孩子死後配亨兩廊·眞比要使雄鷄生蛋更難上十倍，所以我也絶不希望替我的兒子造成一個做聖人的環境，我底最高目標，但求安居而已。無奈在上海，除掉那些非有汽車不能通行的愚園路，莫利愛路福履理路等等一帶的闊人住宅區之外，簡直連一問可以安居的屋子也找不到。隣居們不是通宵雀戰，便是澈夜開無線電話，至於唱京調，打相打等小節目，那更是司空見慣無處無之，無日無之了。記得有一次我住在ＸＸ里，隔壁恰好是住幾位大學生的小房子，第一天聽聽彷彿是萬馬奔騰，第二天聽聽，簡直是翻江擾海了，第三天，禮拜六·更了不得·不説别的，先是那兩扇大門的開闔，上下午已逹八十七次之多，嚇得我當晚慌忙退租。最近，又因受不慣隣居們夜夜强迫施以無線電教育，復由ＸＸ坊逃到了Ｘ村來，未遷居前，特地在看弄堂的那裏，化了一塊錢，打聽到了一些弄堂消息，知道我們左隣這一位康白度的小公館，除掉偶然要舉行一二次茶舞會之外，别無他盧。右隣是一位産科醫生，丨一位老處女全家僅三人而已。那不是太好了嗎。於是來不及的擇吉遷入。一住三天，果然心滿意足，不料就在這天下午，産科醫生的招牌之下，又添上了一方「眞耶穌教會」的牌子，第二天清早，睡得正好，陡然一陣「耶穌愛我」「我愛耶穌」的歌聲，由右而起，高入雲霄，聞之睡意盡失，頭目淼然。一瞧時辰鐘，方六點三刻耳。從此，我的天天早起，天天在寫字間裏打瞌睡。這滋味眞不在深夜聽無線電話之下·早知如此，何必多費一番搬塲工夫呢！現在，我眞正明白了，在上海單要爲安凈而擇隣，也不是一件比較雄鷄生蛋容易的事情。小説從九一八以至雙十節的河東鎭上　  汪放庵墻頭標語，又是焕然一新！五色的紙，寫得像龍飛蛇舞般的字，一條條排列着··　　「紀念九一八，要…………。」　　「紀念九一八，不要…………。」　　還有懸空的白布標語，臨風招展。　　這鎭上的長，委員，小學生，教師；於是，停止辦公，放假！聚在一處開會，演説，唱歌，喊口號！散會後又是餘與，表演游藝。這樣閙了一天。説是念紀一九一八，然而，國難當頭，弔者大悦！因爲到會參加的民衆，都在嘻皮笑臉，看女學生的跳舞。長，委員·也都拍掌歡呼。　　　　○　　　　　　　○　　　　　　○　　眨眨眼不到一個月光景，墻頭標語，又是焕然一新，只見一條條「念紀九一八……」的標語上面貼上了這麽幾行··　　「念紀雙十節，要…………。」　　「念紀雙十節，不要…………。」　　我在一所巷裡，看到一條標語··　　「國難當頭，念紀國慶…………。」我起初莫名其妙，後來才恍然大悟；原來新的標語，蓋上舊的標語，却不曾遮没舊標語的這「國難當頭」四個觸目驚心的大字。但，反轉來一想··國難中恭逢國慶，怎麽不使人觸目驚心呢？　　這天，鎭上的長，委員，小學生，教師；又忙着閙了一天，照例舉行開會演説等等。晚上，却格外熱閙，有提登會，有各處的爆竹聲，把這小小的鎭市，眞的好似成了一座不夜之城！於是，民衆們都高呼··　　「雙十節萬歲！」因爲他們有帷瞧有聽，非凡快活。　　　　○　　　　○　　　　○　　河東鎭是江南的一處山明水秀之鄉，這地方「麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。」所以樣樣都有，何况鍾靈毓秀，就産生了無其數的吃救國飯的朋友，他們都是時勢造成的英雄志士！每逢國家有什麽念紀，不論國恥，國難，國慶；他們總要閙他一天。這個，他們是有一定的方式，進行的程序，便是··　　「推定代表，籌備，募捐，開會，演説，表演游藝，喊口號等等。」　　○　　　　　○　　　　○　　　　○　　是前年的雙十節吧。他們這一　愛國志士，正在開會慶祝當兒；忽然縣長光臨，躬與其盛。於是；有人跳上台去演説道··　　「今天承蒙縣長大駕光臨，非常榮幸；縣長是我們的父母，他給予我們的恩典，眞是皇天罔極！今天我們在慶祝雙十節，又恰好縣長光臨，我們尤其覺得非常榮幸！縣長的德政，眞的可與辛亥革命的烈士的功勞，同垂千古。…………。」他在不知所云地説着，同時；下面參加的民衆，也有人在領導着喊道··　　「辛亥革命烈士精神不死；」　　「縣長恩典德政不朽！」　　「國慶念紀籌備委員會萬歲！」　　　　○　　　　○　　　　○　　今年的雙十節中，我可惜已離開這河東鎭。但不知他們如何？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fang Jil Event: Peaceful Prospects Dim, Fang Zhenwu's Evasive Reply to He; Military Council Discusses Response; Small Clashes Occur in Various Frontline Areas; Armed Resolution Being Prepared <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council spent much of today discussing the Fang Jil issue. Due to the unresolved military situation in northern Hebei, the review of military forces in North China will be postponed. Regarding the Fang Jil issue, a political solution is feared unlikely. The authorities are making thorough preparations in all respects. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu has already replied to He Yingqin today. The content, besides stating that Guo is his official representative sent to Beiping for negotiations, indicates his hope for a solution based on the principle of him not leaving the army. The wording is particularly evasive. Therefore, a thorough resolution to the Fang Jil issue is difficult for the time being. The authorities decided to meet with Guo tonight, urging him to persuade Fang to pull back from the brink and leave the army as soon as possible, so that incorporation can proceed. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At the Military Council's routine meeting this morning, the chairman reported on the course of Fang's envoy coming to Beiping to negotiate surrender. Subsequently, Wan Fulin reported on the situation at the front. Finally, Fang's letters and telegrams were reviewed and discussed at length, and a general decision was reached. Several routine cases were then passed. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang still demands to be appointed as the commander-in-chief in command of his troops, making Guo Yunlong's negotiations difficult, and the future looks bleak. Guo is currently awaiting orders in Xiyuan. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Beiping dispatch, negotiations between He Yingqin and Fang Zhenwu's representative have completely broken down, according to sources at the Beiping Military Council. Therefore, He has ordered the Central 25th Division, led by Guan Linzheng, to take the offensive. (Eleventh dispatch, via telecommunication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Beiping dispatch states that He Yingqin has obtained Japan's understanding and has decided to resolve the Fang contingent by force. The Japanese Western Garrison Commander in Chengde today, through military attache Shibayama, informed He Yingqin that the Japanese military, maintaining an independent stance, directly issued a warning to Fang Zhenwu. If Fang's troops do not comply, the Japanese military will take appropriate measures. (Eleventh dispatch, via telecommunication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Beiping dispatch states that at 10 AM today, He Yingqin convened an emergency meeting of the Military Council. Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, and others attended. After discussion, the following was decided: Although Fang Zhenwu's army has sent a representative to Beiping to request surrender, they have not ceased attacking the Dadongliu area as of 7 AM this morning. Therefore, it was decided to launch a military campaign against them. Accordingly, a preparation for attack order was issued to Wan Fulin's army. At the same time, the Central 25th Division was ordered to advance. With the understanding of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Central 25th Division will advance from Gaokai to the ○○○ area, attacking Fang Zhenwu's forces from the east, aiming to annihilate Fang's entire command in one fell swoop. (Eleventh dispatch, via telecommunication)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fang Jil Troops Advance and Harass, Are Repelled <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A military dispatch from Gaoliying reports that last night and at dawn today, approximately 300 to 400 of Fang's troops harassed the vicinity of Dadongliu and Xiaodongliu. They were repelled by our forces, and the area is now calm. A dispatch from Shahe reports that Fang's troops once harassed Mafang Village last night but were repelled. Furthermore, there is no change in the frontline situation. In recent days, Fang has sent envoys to negotiate surrender, and our army has ceased offensive operations to show leniency. However, seeing that our army has ceased offensive operations, Fang's troops have taken the opportunity to be active and occasionally cause disturbances. At midnight last night, they harassed Daliushu, and at 3 AM, they harassed Da Xiaolangou, all of which were repelled by our forces. Currently, there is no movement. Our forces have deployed heavy defenses and are maintaining strict vigilance, determined not to allow any intrusions. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Mafang dispatch states that at 1 AM this morning, approximately 400 to 500 of Fang Jil's troops, armed with broadswords and hand grenades, launched an attack on the National Army's positions. The stationed troops immediately responded with machine gun fire. Fang's troops launched repeated melee attacks, lasting for an hour, before being routed by the National Army and retreating towards Daliushu and Xiaotangshan. The National Army did not pursue. Fang's troops suffered heavy casualties, and the situation remains at a stalemate. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There were minor clashes in areas such as Gao Camp and Mafang, all of which resulted in casualties for Fang's troops. It is rumored that Fang has established his headquarters in a certain hotel in Tangshan. Last night, Fang and others held a meeting, reportedly discussing the issue of invading Beiping. According to reliable sources, Fang and others have no sincere intention of surrendering, so peace talks have broken down. It is rumored that Tang Kaelin's troops have arrived at the Hulu River (transliteration) and will soon merge with Fang's forces. The Beiping authorities are closely monitoring information about military affairs and peace talks. Today, three morning newspapers were banned from publishing for a week for publishing military intelligence. (Tenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Beiping dispatch, Fang Zhenwu's troops launched a fierce offensive from last night until this morning. They are engaged in fierce battles with the Central Army in various locations between Gaoliying and Changping, including Dadongliu, Daliushu, Langou, and Mafang. Fang's army reorganized its forces during the ceasefire with the Central Army, so this is now an offensive. (Eleventh dispatch, via telecommunication)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zhu Hongxun Convenes a Meeting of Military Officers <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Mafang dispatch states that Fang Jil's troops have been moving towards Da Xiaofu Ren, Xinzhuang, and Shangzhuangying from Qincheng and Xingshou for days, with unclear intentions. Fang Jil's headquarters is extorting provisions from the Tangshan Chamber of Commerce on a household-by-household basis. Zhu Hongxun inspected the frontline positions this morning, convened a meeting of officers of battalion commander rank and above in Mafang, and gave instructions on strategy. At 9 PM last night, Wan's army captured three prisoners at the northern positions in Mafang. According to them, they are from the First Army's Gan Zhongfu Training Regiment of Fang's forces and intended to return to their native place due to the harsh treatment in Fang's army. Now that they have been captured, they request resettlement. They were sent to the Military Council this morning for disposition. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fang Zhenwu Relocates to Zhaijia Village <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Gaoliying dispatch states that at 2 AM this morning, approximately one thousand of Fang Jil's troops, divided, harassed Shangxia Langou, Da Xiaodongliu, and other places from Da Xiaofu Renzhuang, engaging in fierce clashes with the National Army. By 7 AM, Fang Jil's troops were unable to hold out and retreated. Fang moved from the Tangshan Hotel to Zhaijia Village, about a mile from Tangshan, last night, and his headquarters was also established there. Troops of Fang Jil have also arrived at Baishe Village and other places. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Response Plan To Be Decided Soon <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu previously sent representative Guo Yunlong to Beiping to meet with He and negotiate incorporation. He has not yet met with him but has only sent personnel to meet in his place. Meanwhile, he telegraphed Fang to inquire whether Guo is an official representative and can be responsible. He is awaiting Fang's reply to Beiping. However, Fang still hopes for a central position in name, temporarily not leaving the army. The authorities believe that the central government has already discussed Fang's punishment, and the naming layer must be submitted to the central government to decide whether Jil has not expressed himself and will have to make other arrangements. Whether the final solution for Fang's troops will be military or political is expected to be known within three to five days. According to a source in a certain military authority, the views on Fang's matter are as follows: 1. Fang's request to reorganize his troops may be permitted, but Fang must report the number of troops and weapons under his command, and then submit to the Central Government for verification. 2. Fang himself must leave the army. 3. The matter of guaranteeing his life and providing funds for him to go abroad will be submitted to the Central Government for review. Guo Yunlong reported this to Fang by radio, but has not yet received a reply. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin, accompanied by Secretary Zhou and others, arrived safely in Yokohama at 11 AM on the 11th aboard the Chichibu Maru. They immediately transferred to a train to Tokyo to take up their post. During the voyage, he made the following remarks to visiting reporters: I returned home due to illness and have been recuperating in Lushan, which has been quite effective. Therefore, I am resuming my post this time. My delayed return has caused much speculation, but in reality, there is no political significance whatsoever. The discussions at the Lushan Conference were solely for establishing national policies for China's future. Jiang Jieshi's views on Japan are difficult for a third party to discern. The situation in East Asia, especially the close relationship between China and Japan, has an impact on the global situation, which is clear to everyone. If the Sino-Japanese relationship is to break through the current difficulties, then mutual sincerity between the two governments is the only means. If the national sentiments of the two countries deteriorate, it will also be a major obstacle. Therefore, it is not appropriate to be alarmed by illusions. Sufficiently guiding public opinion will naturally lead to improvement. The rumors that the Lushan Conference required China to implement a three-year air force plan are also unfounded. To put it bluntly, my country is prepared, especially since the air force cannot be expanded in a short period of time. Your country has no malicious plans, and the reason why the relations between China and Japan have deteriorated is the credulous belief in past rumors, which deserves great attention. I have brought effective instructions to solve the Sino-Japanese problem and will do my best to improve relations between the two countries based on these instructions. I have a full awareness of this. I also exchanged views with Mr. Hirota and seemed to share the same sentiments. I hope to meet with him soon and hear his insights.

<h3 id="e23">The Compilation of Local Budgets Should Take Into Account the People's Ability to Bear the Burden   Ren <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>In the thirty-third session of the Legislative Yuan last week (the 6th), ten "Points to Note in the Compilation of Local Budgets" were passed. They spoke very frankly about the current problems of local budgets and how to improve them. Among them, the fourth point, that the preparation of budgets should take into account the people's ability to bear the burden, is the most pertinent. In today's world of chaotic finances, national hardship, and impoverished people, we all believe that taking into account the people's ability to bear the burden is the most urgent task in reorganizing local finances. "Draining the pond to catch all the fish" and "burning the forest to hunt" will inevitably lead to a day when both public and private sectors are exhausted, and finances will be impossible to reorganize.</p>
<p>However, the excessive taxes and levies in our country's localities have become increasingly severe in recent years. There are many overlapping and redundant items. For example, in Henan Province alone, according to a report from the provincial finance department in the past, there were more than seventy types of miscellaneous levies. The heavy tax burden in the border areas of Sichuan and Yunnan is even beyond our imagination. Let us take the current situation of levies along the Chengdu-Chongqing route as an example. There are checkpoints everywhere along the way. If you buy 100 yuan of groceries in Chongqing and transport them to Chengdu via Xiaochuanbei, the journey is only 820 miles, but the total tax is about 100 yuan, averaging 10 yuan for every eight miles. This is the most prominent example. In addition, the pre-collection of agricultural taxes in various provinces for several years, even decades, and the surcharges exceeding two or three times to seven or eight times the regular tax, are even more common phenomena. Today, there are endless new taxes and levies in various places, such as national crisis donations and national salvation donations, or bandit suppression donations, etc., which may not all be used in practice, but are still relatively plausible. As for the clever establishment of names, such as Sichuan's Deng Gong Temple stamp tax and lazy tax (fines for not planting opium) or superstition tax, etc., the names are even more bizarre and make us a laughingstock at home and abroad. In addition to taxes and levies, there are also various allocations of public bonds and forced subscriptions of treasury bonds. The organizers certainly execute them based on reasonable principles, but the executors can hardly avoid harsh demands that harm the people. It is difficult to match the people's ability to bear the burden.</p>
<p>All of the above is the state of local financial revenue today. However, looking back at the situation of expenditures, the progress of construction within the province is slow, and educational funding is also in arrears for a long time. What we hear and see is mostly distressing. According to the statistics published in the China Bank Monthly, more than 41% of the public bonds issued by various provinces last year were for purchasing military supplies, and more than 21% were for reorganizing finances and making up for military expenses, while only 1% was for local business funds. The revenue situation is like that, and the expenditure situation is like this. The unsoundness of our local finances today is undeniable. In recent years, most of the budgets of our country's provinces have been insufficient to cover expenditures. Even in the few provinces that maintain a balance between income and expenditure on the surface of the budget, the actual situation is just to conceal their deficit by using methods of fictitious income and actual expenditure. Therefore, if we want to talk about preparing budgets today, we should take into account the people's ability to bear the burden. The prerequisite is to start by tightening local expenditures, cutting redundant organizations, reducing unnecessary expenses, working hard on the development of productive industries, reducing all kinds of unproductive consumption, and encouraging the integrity of officials. Then, financial expenditures can be reduced, and the collection of income can also be commensurate with the people's ability to bear the burden. Perhaps there is hope for a slight recovery from the people's hardship.</p>
<p>In today's China, everywhere we look, the country is desolate. The countryside is bankrupt, and industry and commerce are declining. The failure of local revenues to take into account the people's ability to bear the burden may also be an important reason for this situation. Therefore, if the provinces can follow the central government's guidelines in the future, making expenditures according to income and working hard on the preparation of rational budgets, and change the old malpractices of the past, then it will not be too late to mend the fold after the sheep have escaped. As an ancient saying goes, "When wealth accumulates, the people disperse; when wealth is distributed, the people gather." It also says, "Don't worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality; don't worry about poverty, but worry about instability." May those who manage local finances today deeply understand these words.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Conflict Between the Civilian and Military Factions in Japan Intensifies; Military Dictatorship is Brewing; Most Cabinet Members Support Takahashi; Hirota and Araki Threaten to Go Their Own Way <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the recent remarks made by Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, and Araki, the Minister of the Army, it seems that a dictatorial government is brewing in Japan, with the military personnel as the main force. Takahashi declared that if the current events continue to progress, Japan may become a dictatorship. In order to complete national defense, financial reorganization may even be sacrificed. Minister of the Army Araki said that in the next three months, Japan will undergo major changes, and he expects that the drastic changes in all aspects will be surprising. The Minister of Finance is currently in a fierce dispute with people from the army and navy regarding the cost of the national defense plan. The army's budget for next year is 680,000,000 yen, while the navy's is 560,000,000 yen. These numbers almost account for the entire national tax revenue, and the budget shortfall will reach 1,000,000,000 yen. Many people in the army are willing to emulate Italy or Soviet Russia, dissolve the current political parties, and establish a one-party dictatorship. Therefore, the brewing of dictatorship in Japan is becoming more active. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The five-minister conference continued this afternoon. The opinions of Takahashi and Hirota, who advocate diplomacy based on international coordination, and the opinions of the military, who believe that preparations should be made for the worst-case scenario in the current situation, remain opposed. The army believes that the effectiveness of liberal diplomacy has long been proven to be ineffective. The empire's international environment cannot be resolved by diplomacy alone, so preparations for national defense must be made first, and then diplomatic skills can be used. The military expenses they want are simply to pay the continuing expenses that have been postponed all at once, but they refuse to do so, which is a lack of understanding. Therefore, they all support the views of Minister of the Army Araki. Minister Araki has already taken a firm stand that he cannot compromise. On the other hand, the opinions of Takahashi and Hirota are supported by most cabinet members. Although Minister Araki hopes that this issue will not affect the survival of the cabinet, the general trend is irresistible. Depending on the outcome of the five-minister conference, the cabinet will either stay or go, and the future path of the empire will be decided, so it is highly valued. (Denstu dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The five-minister conference has not yet found a consensus, and consultations will continue in the future. The military feels great dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the conference. After yesterday's meeting, Minister Araki made a statement to reporters, saying that today's meeting was a continuation of the previous consultation and there was no decision made. If this continues, it is impossible to predict when the meeting will end. If the meeting cannot proceed smoothly or cannot reach a compromise, the prime minister can make a decision, but the issue this time is to decide the major direction that Japan should take in the future, so a complete meeting is necessary no matter what. It is said that certain parties are specifically dealing with the army and trying to split the army's opinion, and there are behind-the-scenes maneuvers during the meeting. Although this has not been confirmed, if it is true, I will sacrifice myself to stop it... (Denstu dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The five-minister conference continued to meet at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2 p.m. today. Minister of the Army Araki stated the urgency of the international situation and strongly advocated that the expansion of military spending is absolutely necessary. However, Foreign Minister Hirota argued that the urgency of the international situation is indeed a fact, but there is still room for diplomatic techniques to be used. This is certainly the time to use diplomatic techniques, so it is too early to consider the worst-case scenario. Minister of Finance Takahashi also maintained the Foreign Minister's position, resulting in a failure to reach a consensus between the two. However, the budget issue was not discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 5 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for the 16th or 18th, as Minister of the Army Araki will be traveling on Friday and Saturday is the Shinname Festival. (Denstu dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>The five-minister conference discussing national defense, diplomacy, and finance—the three national policies—has already been held three times, but the military authorities and the foreign and treasury authorities are sticking to their opinions and refusing to compromise. At the meeting on the 10th, the two sides had a fierce debate, but they only discussed principles and did not reach any conclusions. The next fourth and fifth meetings are scheduled for the 16th and 20th. After that, the five-minister conference will be suspended, and after the army's special grand exercise is completed, it will be handed over to the cabinet budget meeting for continued discussion. (Nichi-Ren dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official sources, at yesterday's five-minister conference, the opinions of the military and finance departments were very close. Minister of the Army Araki said that the military does not oppose the Foreign Ministry's peace work, but there is a certain limit to the peace policy. Work that exceeds this limit must have sufficient military force as its backing to achieve considerable results. Standing on this position, the military must have sufficient military force to protect the lifeline of Manchuria and the South Seas, protect vested interests, defend the national territory, and protect the lives and property of 70 million Japanese people. Foreign Minister Hirota and Minister of Finance Takahashi also acknowledged the principle of the military's position, so the next five-minister conference should have considerable progress.

<p>(London) The British media is paying close attention to and is very concerned about the increasingly tense relations between Japan and Russia. The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph published an article today, signed by a diplomatic affairs reporter, stating that within a few months, the Japanese cabinet will be entirely composed of army and navy personnel, assisted by a few civil officials who are proficient in economic and financial matters. "Young Japanese soldiers want to make various workers approve of the military's diplomatic policy, so on domestic issues, they advocate adopting positive state socialism." The newspaper also said that although the current Japanese cabinet is superficially composed of civil officials, it is secretly controlled by the General Staff. The General Staff constantly hinders the government's actions. Rather than that, it would be better to openly implement a military dictatorship. (Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After receiving the report from Ambassador Ota, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures regarding the secret letter case. Although the military's attitude is tough, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also protest to Russia. The countermeasures decided at the meeting are as follows: (1) Recognize that the document is a forged official letter from the Russian side, and the Japanese side is determined to deny it to the end. (2) Recognize that the Soviet Union's announcement of this diplomatic document is an act of bad faith that is intolerable in international credibility. (3) Russia announced this document at a time when Japanese-Manchurian relations are so tense. What is their intention? It should be actively investigated. (4) Russia's actions are sufficient to discredit the Japanese government internationally, so the Japanese government must take necessary countermeasures to maintain its image. (5) Urge Russia to apologize to Japan, otherwise it will have to take necessary measures, etc. It is reported that Foreign Minister Hirota has already telegraphed Ambassador Ota to inquire with Russia about the situation and ordered him to protest. (Hua-Lian dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The exposure of the so-called Hishikari General document by Soviet Russia has put the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a difficult position. They are currently awaiting the report from Japanese Ambassador Ota stationed in Russia before deciding what to do. However, before deciding what to do, the cabinet or the military will discuss it first. A spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Soviet Russia wants to push the relations between Japan and Russia into a major crisis and seek a fundamental solution, either war or peace. Soviet Russian newspapers recently published an article entitled "Exaggeration and War," so I believe that Soviet Russia seems to want to anger the feelings of the entire Japanese nation and make them declare war on Russia. Currently, it is like dogs barking. Both brave and cowardly dogs can bark madly, but the development after barking remains to be seen. The spokesperson also said that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously notified Japanese Ambassador Ota that Soviet Russia was in possession of the document and would announce it "when necessary." However, the document has not yet been shown to Ota to verify its authenticity. The so-called "when necessary" refers to the recent failure to release the Russian officials arrested on the Middle East Road. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Soviet Russia has expressed its refusal to continue participating in the Middle East Road conference held here until all the arrested Russian officials are released. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not take any action towards Soviet Russia until it receives Ota's detailed report. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Army Ministry expressed indignation today regarding the Soviet Russia's release of the so-called Hishikari document, saying that the army is now demanding that Foreign Minister Hirota lodge a strong protest with Soviet Russia, accompanied by a demand that Soviet Russia must withdraw the document or admit that the document is forged, and a warning that if Soviet Russia does not comply, Japan will take more severe measures. The so-called more severe measures include not only the termination of the Middle East Road negotiations, but also the possibility of the ultimate severance of diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan. Hishikari did not have a plan to forcibly seize the Middle East Road in conjunction with "Manchukuo." If he did, then the Sixth Division, which was sent to Manchuria in January of this year, would not have been completely transferred back to the country, leaving only three and a half divisions in Manchuria. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that after receiving the report from the ambassador to Russia, a practical solution will be determined. Whether diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan continue depends on how Soviet Russia responds in the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>From Chita, this station received a message from Harbin that the provocative actions of the swindlers of the so-called "acting" Russian staff of the Middle East Railway who were arrested have once again incited new incidents. On October 6, the police used the excuse that the "Manchu" deputy director needed to use it and forcibly opened the closed door of the office of Gulerelya, the director of the Accounting Department who had been arrested. After the seals were destroyed, a policeman was stationed in front of the office door. Director of the Railway Bureau Roty reported this matter to the Board of Directors, requesting that measures be taken to stop the police from interfering with the destruction of the normal work of the railway administration. Zhang Mingqi, the "Manchu" deputy director, sent an ultimatum to Tolstov, the chairman of the Railway Administration Committee, requesting the recognition of the "Manchu" staff illegally appointed to replace the arrested Soviet staff as members of the committee. Tolstov replied that the candidates for members of the committee were all stipulated by specific legal rules, and at the same time, the committee had no right to discuss the appointment of personnel that was purely within the scope of the director of the administration. At that time, all the "Manchu" members of the committee left their seats in anger, resulting in the meeting being adjourned due to a lack of quorum. A message from Chita said that the police at the Manzhouli station are also interfering as much as possible with the daily work of the Middle East Railway, and are not allowed to temporarily appoint the storage director Levitsky to take over, and are threatening employees who do not obey the orders of the personnel sent by the "Manchu" side, saying that they will take repressive measures. The above-mentioned "Manchu" staff usurped the powers of the director of the office after the actual director of the office, Soviet staff Xue Zenggu, was arrested.</p>

When Shi replied, he only said that the arrested personnel were summoned by the prosecutor and said that they were "suspected of violating their duties" and were currently under investigation. Consul General Si requested the immediate release of the arrested personnel and warned Shi that the "Manchu" government should bear exceptional responsibility for this. Shi intended to refute this protest, but after Si insisted, he said that he would inform the "Manchu" government of the protest and request. At the same time, Shi informed Si that the authorities refused Si's visit to the arrested Soviet staff before the investigation was completed. (TASS dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, in an editorial titled "Documents Confirming the Japanese Government's Responsibility for Adventures in Manchuria," reiterated the statement made by Deputy Foreign Commissar Sokolnikov on September 21. Sokolnikov had stated, based on reliable information received by the Soviet government, that the "Manchukuo" government, under the instructions of the Japanese government, was planning a large-scale change in the management of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), and that the Manchurian authorities, under the instruction of Japanese government agents, were planning to take a large number of police-enforced measures against Soviet staff on the CER. Sokolnikov also pointed out in his statement that all acts of violation of the existing treaties related to the CER, and the prepared seizure of the railway, should be the direct responsibility of the actual owner of Manchuria, the Japanese government, and that the weak and powerless "Manchukuo" could not be held responsible. The newspaper continued, stating that three days later, Soviet employees of the CER were arrested. The reason given for their arrest, at the request of the audit director, was "loss of trust from the authorities." As soon as the arrests were completed, the Japanese and "Manchukuo" sides attempted to illegally appoint Manchurian personnel to replace the arrested Soviet employees. This proves that the real reason for the arrests was to remove certain Soviet railway personnel and replace them with personnel appointed by the Japanese side, thus effectively seizing the CER. Izvestia also referred to the letter from Sokolnikov to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on September 28, in which Sokolnikov emphasized, "These steps are the beginning of the implementation of a plan that was meticulously drafted and decided upon in previous meetings held by the Japanese military delegation with the presence of the most responsible Japanese leaders in Manchuria. The Soviet government will publish all documents necessary to confirm the methods of the Japanese military commander's actions in Manchuria and the Japanese administration in Manchuria when necessary." The Japanese government did not provide a satisfactory response to the Soviet government's protests, so the Soviet government found it necessary to make all its documentary evidence public. The newspaper further stated that the documents released yesterday are only a part of the documentary material and are official documents of the Japanese government. They have exposed the actual structure and details of the CER incident. These documents prove that the reason for the arrest of Soviet CER employees was not due to their committing a crime or "losing trust." These arrest actions are part of a plan to seize the CER, which was drafted by the Japanese government and implemented by its agents. The newspaper also quoted the report of the Japanese Lieutenant General Hishikari on September 4, stating that the purpose of the clauses listed in the treaty that were "unacceptable" was to cover up their trampling of the treaty and obligations, and their destruction of the current situation of the CER. The report on September 9 contained direct instructions on how to violate the treaty, and for the sake of official grandeur, it used the formula of "court actions" to cover up its destructive behavior. These arrest incidents stipulated by the Japanese plan, and other provocative actions, such as instigating private creditors of the CER to demand money from the railway and detaining railway businesses, are all obvious examples of this destructive idea. The reports of Japanese diplomats link these steps regarding the CER with the attempt by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" sides to put pressure on Tokyo to sell the CER. Most importantly, these official Japanese documents have undoubtedly proven that the provocative actions on the CER were planned and implemented by the Japanese government ordering its representatives in Manchuria. These official documents show that the issue of the steps regarding the CER was discussed as early as the meeting on September 2, attended by representatives of the Japanese Embassy in Manchuria and representatives of the Kwantung Army, the latter being the backbone of the meeting, and the one instructing on the measures. The report of Hishikari on September 9 shows that "a second meeting, attended by the same personnel as before, drafted a concrete plan of action, which was subsequently reported to Tokyo for approval by the military authorities and the embassy, while requesting the Foreign Minister to 'immediately telegraph your Excellency's opinion on the above.'" The report also shows that this plan was executed following the instructions of the Japanese military delegation stationed in Harbin. The report of September 19 indicates that after receiving a reply from the leaders' offices in Tokyo, Japanese officials held a meeting in the hall of the Japanese military delegation stationed in Harbin to make the final decision on the specific plan. Izvestia stated that the plan to seize the CER was a plan of the Japanese government, and the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for the planning, implementation, and consequences of this plan, which is absolutely clear. These already published official documents of the Japanese government,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>resolve the issue of responsibility beyond doubt. These documents also expose and confirm the following facts: the plan to invade the CER, under the hypocritical cover of the myth of the "independence" of "Manchukuo," was actually directed by Tokyo and executed by Japanese police and Japanese officials formally serving in "Manchukuo" under the direction of local direct military and diplomatic agents of Tokyo. The newspaper continued, stating that now the world understands the secret of the CER incident, and at the same time, the whole world knows who is the author and leader of anti-Soviet adventures. The Japanese ministers are engaged in dangerous games. The Soviet government's declarations on September 21 and 28 have given serious warnings to the Japanese government. The most recent warning stated that "the full responsibility for such consequences should be borne by the Japanese government." The newspaper concluded by stating that the announcement of the official documents exposing the Japanese government's plan to seize the CER is another serious warning to the Japanese government, holding it responsible for its adventurous actions in Manchuria.

Therefore, political figures declared, "The future of the Far East is becoming increasingly bleak. It is really inappropriate for Russia to have conflicts with Germany over unimportant incidents. However, if the Soviet Russian authorities give it a little consideration, it will not be difficult to eliminate the tense situation between Germany and Russia. We have given more to Soviet Russia and received less from Soviet Russia. The reason why the crusade against radicalism has not yet been launched is not due to the relationship between France and Poland, but actually due to German self-restraint, which the Soviet Russian authorities are well aware of," etc. This statement can prove a piece of news, that for some time, there have been rumors that Germany and Soviet Russia intend to conclude a new agreement to reorganize the procedures for credit sales and payments, and that the relationship between journalists of the two countries will also be restored (after the arrest of two Soviet Russian journalists in Leipzig, Germany, all Soviet Russian journalists stationed in Germany were recalled, and all German journalists in Russia were also expelled back to their country).

<p>(London) Tonight, German representative Nadolny and French representative Poncet held disarmament talks in Geneva, which had unexpected and important developments. The two talked for an hour and a half. Nadolny expressed the German government's sincerity in resolving the disarmament issue, but insisted that any convention must be one that Germany can freely accept and implement. Nadolny's statement was extremely moderate in tone, while Poncet firmly stated that France could not make any concessions on the fundamental points. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also received the British and French ambassadors in Rome to discuss disarmament matters. The British delegation in Geneva stated that it was willing to undertake the work of drafting a new draft treaty, and all the points agreed upon in recent international negotiations would be included. British Foreign Secretary Eden has begun contacting the chief representatives of other major countries. Eden now feels that today's negotiations have reached the deeply entrenched part of the disarmament issue. The main difficulties of the negotiations are Germany's request to obtain all types of weapons currently held by the major powers to express equality, and the issue of punishment for violating the disarmament convention. British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Paris by plane tonight and took a train to Geneva after staying for a few hours. Before departing from London, Simon had received German Ambassador Hoesch.

Afterwards, a statement issued by the German delegation stated that these private talks have provided a good opportunity for the representatives of various countries to further explain their views, and that these talks must continue tomorrow.

According to various newspapers, the so-called sanctions issue is now being put aside temporarily. The United States has made great efforts to obtain a solution on the issue of managing armaments and military aircraft that can be accepted by various countries and Germany.

<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here this morning from Paris and immediately led Foreign Secretary Eden to visit French Foreign Minister Poncet for talks. French figures had a good impression of the British cabinet's discussion of the disarmament issue on Monday of this week. After the meeting between the British and French foreign ministers today, the impression was even better. The opinions of the two governments on the disarmament issue were already in agreement before Germany's verbal reply, and even after the reply. This can be seen from Foreign Minister Simon's explanation to Foreign Minister Poncet. After Simon and Eden met with Poncet, they went to visit Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference. Davis agreed with the British views, as did Poncet. According to the US Secretary of State Hull, in this regard, a statement was issued, saying that if necessary, the United States would not hesitate to adopt the economic sanctions methods contained in the 1921 US-German peace treaty to stop Germany from rearming. This is generally considered to be extremely important. Simon, Poncet, and Davis are scheduled to meet this afternoon, which also shows the joint relationship between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States on the disarmament issue.

<p>(London) Unless there is a very strong reason, the United Kingdom will oppose extending the Disarmament Conference. The United Kingdom certainly does not approve of turning the disarmament draft treaty into an arms convention. This is the attitude decided by the British Cabinet after a two-hour meeting today. The essence of British policy is sympathetic cooperation. Therefore, when Foreign Secretary Simon departs for Geneva this week, he will not be given strict instructions. It is now hoped that if the preparatory period proceeds smoothly as planned, then real disarmament can be ensured. Italy, the United States, and France all have a tendency to agree to this, and Germany is also half-willing. However, what is still causing suspicion now is whether Germany's actions can reach the extent deemed necessary by many parties. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Henderson Describes Difficult Points <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The main leaders of the Disarmament Conference met at 4:20 this afternoon. Chairman Henderson briefly described the recent disarmament talks, saying that the talks should continue for several days because there is a need for political resolutions. There are still 14 unresolved issues, the most important of which are the three items of the trial period, punishment, and the implementation of the principle of equality. Henderson advocated the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee without waiting for all countries to ratify it, and said that twenty-four ratifications would be sufficient. After a brief discussion by the meeting, the meeting was adjourned until Saturday so that French Foreign Minister Poncet could return to Paris to participate in the House of Representatives meeting. It is heard that the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will be convened on October 16. Japan was represented by Ambassador Sato to Belgium at today's leading group meeting. Before the meeting, US Chief Representative Davis expressed optimism, saying that everyone knows that things are already very bad, and something must be done. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Wakatsuki Advocates for Naval Convention; US-Japan Naval Competition Would Greatly Harm Japan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Wakatsuki, the chief representative of Japan at the 1930 London Naval Conference and the president of the Minseito Party, has been silent for two years. This afternoon, at the Minseito Party congress in Nagoya, he advocated for the naval convention and warned the audience that if the 1935 naval conference fails and ends, it will inevitably promote a new arms race between Japan and the United States, and Japan is afraid that it will suffer greatly. Wakatsuki also said that although the convention is not perfect, Japan's acceptance of it is of great benefit to the empire. Wakatsuki's speech is very relevant because it is the first response to the criticism of the naval convention made by the defendants in the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in the military court.

<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, reported on his travels to major European countries at a meeting of the chief committee, saying that the conclusion he reached on this trip was that all countries wanted an early decision. The British draft should be read a second time, so as to reach an agreement on the reduction and restriction of armaments. The situation is now fully clear. The difficulties hindering the general agreement can be divided into two categories: one is easier to solve, and the other is more difficult to handle. The first category is (1) non-use of force, (2) definition of aggressor, (3) overall terms and monitoring, (4) separate management of budget events, (5) bombing of the sky, (6) establishment of a permanent disarmament committee, (8) naval issues. The above are easier to solve. The second category is (1) the length of the first phase period stipulated in the convention, (2) the size of tanks and artillery positions, (3) how to reduce land warfare equipment, whether by destruction or other methods, (4) private manufacturing and sale of ammunition, (5) naval and army aviation, (6) penalties for violators. The above are more difficult to handle. As for the effective period of the convention, most countries advocate for five years, and some advocate for eight years, which is divided into two phases, the first four years being a trial period. The permanent disarmament committee can be responsible for determining whether the control and monitoring agencies are effective during the trial period. It is his intention that the convention does not have to be ratified before the permanent committee opens. German representative Nadolny hopes that the General Assembly will read the British draft a second time, and British representative Eden is responsible for drafting the points in the draft that have already been agreed upon by the representatives.

<p>(Geneva) This morning, the League of Nations Assembly held its final meeting and passed the resolution on minority issues proposed by the French representative. (Note: The first part of this case stipulates that all countries should treat residents who are in a minority position due to race, religion, and language fairly and tolerantly in the spirit of the current treaties, the same as other residents, even for countries that have been relieved of all obligations by the League of Nations. The second part recognizes that excluding certain kinds of people hinders the rights of minorities and violates current treaties. (However, the German representative voted against the resolution because it involved Jews, rendering it invalid, but its moral power remains complete, because the League of Nations Assembly ignored Germany's opposition and voted in favor of the resolution as a whole, putting Germany in an isolated position. The Assembly then approved the decision on German refugee relief affairs, i.e., establishing a high commissioner to handle this matter, and other issues.) Finally, the chairman, the representative of South Africa, Watt, made the closing remarks as usual, describing the work of the General Assembly one by one. The General Assembly ended its work at 3:30 in the afternoon and announced its closure. (Dispatch from Havas on the 11th)</p>

<p>Telegram from Ningbo: To the editors of the Shanghai Shen Bao: Greetings. The Tianyi Pavilion in Yin County was originally built by Fan Dongming, the Secretary of War during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, and his son Fan Shou. In addition to storing books, it was also extensively landscaped with gardens and pavilions for scholars to visit and relax. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Fan Maozhu, an eighth-generation descendant of the Secretary of War, presented books for inspection and was rewarded with 10,000 volumes of the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times. At that time, the Qing court discussed establishing Yuan Pavilions and other structures, and sent officials to Yin County to survey the style of the pavilions and order their imitation. The richness of the Tianyi Pavilion's collection and the refinement of its architecture are known to all, from our country to overseas nations. It has always been the premier collector. From the Ming Dynasty to the present, more than 400 years have passed. It has suffered from wars and looting, and most of the books have been damaged. The gardens have become overgrown with weeds. Among the descendants of Secretary of War Fan, there is no lack of intelligent people, but with a large population, it is difficult to reach a consensus. Moreover, the pavilion occupies a large area, and construction is not easy. For this reason, discussions about repairs are often interrupted. On September 18th and 19th of this year, a typhoon caused disaster, and the entire eastern wall of the pavilion collapsed. The wind and rain damaged the books. If repairs are not carried out quickly, the remaining texts and slips are in imminent danger. The committee held its fourth regular meeting on October 1st of this year. The matter was proposed by members Ma Lian, Chen Baolin, Ye Qianliang, and others. After discussion, the committee decided to</p>
<p>organize a committee to repair the Tianyi Pavilion, with preparatory members responsible for carrying out the work first. In addition to notifying the descendants of the Fan family to start emergency repairs, the cost of repairing the entire pavilion is considerable. It is proposed to solicit donations from domestic cultural institutions and scholars interested in archaeology, so that work can begin as soon as possible. If you are willing to help generously, please send the funds directly to the Yin County Literature Committee in Zhongshan Park, Ningbo, or through the Shanghai Ningbo Association or the Yin County government. The matter concerns national culture, and not only the people of Yin County and the descendants of the Fan family are deeply grateful. Furthermore, regarding the catalogue of the Tianyi Pavilion, Ruan Yuntai engraved a ten-volume catalogue during the Jiaqing period, Qian Zhuting compiled a one-volume epigraphic catalogue, and Xue Shuyun continued to engrave a six-volume catalogue of extant books during the Guangxu period. In July of this year, Mr. Cai Yuanpei of the Academia Sinica and Mr. Ye Yuhu, the former Minister of Railways, and others initiated the revision of the catalogue. Zhao Wanli, a compiler from the Beiping Library, has been jointly organized by the committee to sort it out. There are many cases of books without catalogues in the pavilion, and there are also many cases of books without catalogues. Fortunately, the lost books are said to still be in the collections of public and private individuals in our country, and have not yet flowed overseas to foreign lands. If it is possible to donate money to spare, in addition to the repair work, collecting the lost old books would be a great pleasure for the literary world. This is the extravagant hope of the committee members, and it is also what the sages of our country deeply sympathize with. We are looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Feng Zhenqun, Chairman of the Yin County Literature Committee, and members Xin Jiangming, Wu Jingxiong, Xia Qiyu, Sun Zhenqi, Ma Heng, Ma Ying, Ma Lian, Chen Xunzheng, Chen Baolin, Chen Xunci, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Qin, Zhang Chuanbao, Zhang Zhiming, Zhang Yuanwei, Zhang Jin, Zhang Qijun, Ye Qianliang, Zhao Jiasun, Li Yan, Wei Jiong, and 103 others. Anglo-American War Debt Negotiations</p>
<h3 id="e72">Stabilizing Currency Values Discussed First <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th - Anglo-American war debt negotiations began today, and it seems that the first issue discussed was the stabilization of currency values. The Shang Bao newspaper said that the U.S. dollar and the British pound could be stabilized at two-thirds of their former gold parity. The New York Times said that it is now certain that the idea of ​​amortizing war debts with a round sum of one-tenth cannot be accepted. If the negotiations have not ended by the next payment date, which is around December 15, then Britain can still make a payment in accordance with the silver payment method in June to show its creditworthiness. The Times also said that President Roosevelt has an elusive attitude towards the war debt issue, and the attitude of American officials resembles sympathetic onlookers, so the burden of negotiation now falls on the British representative.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fang Zhenwu's Representative Guo Yunlong Arrives in Beiping, Makes Extravagant Demands, Tang and Liu's Troops Continue to Advance South, Frontline Sentries Still in Contact <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang, together with the troops of Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, and Wang Ying, are advancing south again. The eastern route has advanced to Da Xiaodongliu, approaching Gaoliying, while the western route has occupied Da Xiaotang. He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, has recently telegraphed Fang three times, advising him to cease military operations. Fang then sent Councilor Guo Yunlong on the 8th, carrying a personal letter, to Beiping to visit He. The following are the texts of the communications between He and Fang: (1) He's telegram to Fang: "Commander Fang, Uncle Ping, I have received your telegram. I believe you have received my telegram. I ordered the troops on the front line to stop attacking yesterday morning. I hope you will send a responsible representative to Beiping to discuss matters as soon as possible. Everything is fine. He Yingqin, Yu Shen (2) Fang's letter: "Minister He, respected sir, I am stationed in Matun, and things are out of my control. I have no other intentions. I am grateful for your kindness in mediating and finding a solution that benefits both sides. I dare not disobey your orders. However, Zhongfu (Wang) is detained due to an incident, and Yun Sheng (Meng) has gone elsewhere for a reason. I am sending Guo Yunlong to pay my respects on my behalf, convey my sincerity, and discuss everything. I respectfully ask for your sincerity and guidance. Both public and private affairs are deeply appreciated. I express my sincere respect. Fang Zhenwu, 8th"</p>
<p>Guo arrived at the defense area of ​​a certain regiment of Wan Fulin's troops stationed in Mafang at 4:00 PM on the 8th, carrying a white flag and accompanied by more than 20 cavalrymen. The garrison initially suspected trickery, but Guo dismissed the cavalry and came south alone with one attendant, explaining his intentions. The garrison agreed to allow him to pass through, and the regimental commander sent him to the division headquarters in Pingfang. Guo met with Division Commander Zhu Hongxun and that night Zhu sent two cars to send him to the Western Suburb military headquarters. Yesterday morning (the 9th) he entered the city and visited He at the Jurentang at 9:00 AM. He was meeting with Sugimura and could not receive him personally, so he sent Wang Lun to meet him instead. This afternoon (the 10th), He summoned Guo for a face-to-face meeting. It is reported that Guo will return to Tangshan in one or two days to report back. Fang has made extravagant demands, including several items: (1) Hoping that the authorities will improve politics (2) His troops will be reorganized into an army (3) He himself will be a soldier and is willing to work hard for the country and lead his troops to defend the country. He's only condition for Fang is to leave the army. Since Fang refuses to resign, the gap between the two sides' opinions is too wide to negotiate. However, He is eager to cease military operations as soon as possible, and the other side has also proposed several items for earnest consultation: (1) If Fang can leave the army, then everything can be discussed (2) Personal safety is absolutely guaranteed (3) The troops are designated to gather at a specific location, and personnel will be assigned to edit them. It is also planned to send a representative to accompany Fang's representative Guo Yunlong to meet with Fang to discuss matters. What the outcome will be in the future is difficult to predict, but based on observations from all sides, it is feared that a solution will not be easily reached.</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, the war on the front line has entered a state of ceasefire, but the Fang-Ji side is digging trenches and mobilizing troops, which is extremely busy. It was also reported last night that the troops of Tang Yulin and Liu Guitang, etc., are now entering the Great Wall from the Erdaoguan Taolin Pass area one after another. After the majority of the Tang and Liu forces arrive, Fang and Ji will take action. Whether or not this is reliable remains to be proven by facts. At 9:00 PM last night, Fang and Ji also sent a small number of cavalry to attack the Gaoliying and Daxiaodongliu areas, firing hundreds of shots. The garrison suddenly heard the gunshots and also fired artillery in response. The Fang troops then retreated. At the same time, Fang troops' cavalry were also found in the Nanguanzhuang and Dongxiguanzhuang areas of Gaoliying, appearing and disappearing unpredictably in various villages. This morning, the sentries on both sides had minor contact in the Mafang area. The garrison is currently building fortifications for defense. (October 10)</p>

<p>Nanchang Communication: The military affairs of suppressing the Red Army in five provinces are well under way in all aspects of deployment. The northern route is the main force in the five-province campaign against the Red Army as it faces the Red bandits directly, and its importance is even greater. However, Northern Route Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi has not yet taken office in Jiangxi due to the importance of military and political affairs in Henan. Jiang himself has been directing the military affairs in eastern Jiangxi. Now that the general offensive is imminent, Jiang is preoccupied with planning important policies for Zhongqiao, controlling military affairs throughout the country, and directing the suppression of the Red Army in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Central Government to appoint Gu Zhutong as the Northern Route Commander-in-Chief to focus on its success. After accepting the order, Gu arrived in Jiangxi from Zhenjiang in three days to visit Jiang, ask for instructions on the organization of the headquarters, the command of the troops, and discuss the military plans for the suppression. Everything went smoothly with Gu. Gu sent people to the province to organize the headquarters. As soon as preparations are completed, he will set off □□, formally establish it, and only then can Gu change the provincial chairman of Jiangsu, so after deploying things in the province, he will return to Jiangsu to complete the procedures in office, then come to the province to take office, and enter □□ to command the military affairs in eastern Jiangxi. As for Jiang Dingwen, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Route Front, he has already come to Jiangxi, and the general headquarters is also organized in the first industry school, and is formally operating. After Gu returns to Jiangxi and the Northern Route Headquarters is formally established, Jiang will lead the forward headquarters to advance to the front line in □□ County to facilitate command.

<h3 id="e75">Chiang Orders the Hubei Provincial Government to Reform the Decadent Customs of Southern Hubei. The Provincial Government Entrusts the Civil Affairs, Education, and Construction Departments to Formulate Measures. <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The political corruption and lazy customs of Hubei Province are most prominent in the seven counties of western Hubei, such as Shihe, where the wealthy bully the people, finances are chaotic, education is bankrupt, and opium is rampant. After the provincial government conducted an inspection, all the states were announced, and plans were being formulated to organize them. It was unexpected that the various properties in southern Hubei were no less than those in western Hubei. The Western Route Headquarters of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Army, which uses southern Hubei as its suppression area, recently sent Liu Wonan, Yi Baigeng, and others to Tongcheng, Tongshan, Chongyang, Puchi, and Xianning to conduct field inspections. The results obtained are as follows: (1) Finance: Municipal tickets are rampant, finances are chaotic, and the allocation of land per mu in each district is unavoidable to cause disturbance. (2) Construction: Highways and county roads have mostly not started construction, and guard work is also lax. No attention has been paid to wasteland reclamation and afforestation. (3) Education: Social education institutions are all lacking. There are no new-style schools, and there are not many private schools. Most of the people are illiterate. (4) Public Security: There is no plan for suppressing thieves and bandits, and there are no sanitation facilities. People are mostly addicted to opium and gambling. The public security authorities either collect lamp donations and land donations, or collect a license fee of five yuan per person. There is also a license public fee, and each license must pay one thousand yuan before being allowed to operate. Those who commit private smoking and gambling are arrested and fined before being released. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief Jiang also reported that the people of southern Hubei are lazy and corrupt, and particularly addicted to smoking and gambling. He recently sent a telegram from Nanchang ordering the Hubei Provincial Government to find ways to revitalize and reorganize the government in order to change the decadent customs. After receiving the order, the provincial government submitted it to the political affairs meeting on the 6th for discussion and decided to entrust it to the three departments of civil affairs, education, and construction to formulate concrete measures based on the principles instructed by Commander-in-Chief Jiang in the telegram, and submit them for verification and implementation.

<h3 id="e76">The Military Affairs of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are Proceeding Smoothly. Nearly 4,000 Guns Have Been Issued on All Routes. The Bandits Have Suffered Heavy Losses. Post-Disaster Relief is Being Organized in the Border Area. The Use of Funds Has Been Determined. Zhang Qun Has Suspended His Inspection Tour. The Directors of the Various Departments Will Set Off Immediately. <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The military affairs of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been progressing considerably in the past two months under the supervision of Liu Zhenhua, Xu Yuanquan, and Chen Jicheng. In addition to capturing and killing Red bandits, many weapons have also been seized. According to the headquarters' investigation and statistics, the troops on all routes have seized approximately 4,000 guns, all of which have been ordered by the headquarters to be submitted and appropriate bonuses will be awarded separately. Red bandits regard weapons and ammunition as treasures because they are difficult to replenish. During combat, they would rather sacrifice many lives than abandon a gun. The large-scale seizure of weapons shows the depth of the damage they have suffered. The bandits in the border area have suffered the greatest losses among all factions and have now collapsed. Liu Zhenhua is actively organizing post-disaster relief and will abolish the border area headquarters after the remaining bandits have been cleared. A post-disaster relief office will be established instead. During the transition period, a post-disaster relief preparatory office will be established to preside over the office. The total amount of funds had been previously set at 490,000 yuan and its use has now been determined and distributed in advance, divided into two major categories: expenditures and circulation. Expenditures are divided into two categories: relief and construction. Relief includes (1) reception costs of 200,000 yuan, (2) emergency relief costs of 300,000 yuan, (3) work relief costs of 400,000 yuan (4) rehabilitation costs of 40,000 yuan (5) resettlement costs of 60,000 yuan. Construction includes (1) rural construction costs of 850,000 yuan (2) self-cultivating farmer creation costs of 750,000 yuan, totaling 2,600,000 yuan. Circulation is divided into two categories: land consolidation and rural recovery (1) self-cultivating farmer loans of 1,000,000 yuan (2) industrial and commercial cooperative loans of 300,000 yuan (3) reclamation advances of 1,000,000 yuan, totaling 2,300,000 yuan. Among them, the expenditure part needs to raise a base amount in order to prepare for expenditure, while the circulation part is prepared in full by financial institutions. After the advances are disbursed, they will be recovered within a certain period, without the need to raise another base amount.</p>
<p>Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Qun originally planned to tour various places, recover the bandit areas, and personally inquire about the hardships of the people. However, he is now serving concurrently as the Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, and is busy with military affairs and has no time to tour. He has cancelled the previous proposal. Meng Guangpeng, Director of Civil Affairs, and Cheng Qibao, Director of Education, will set off to eastern Hubei in the next few days to inspect and visit Liu Zhenhua in Huangchuan to discuss the implementation of special politics and education. At the same time, Li Fanyi, Director of the Construction Department, will set off to southern Hubei to inspect the construction of roads. Fan Xixu, Director of the Security Office, will also go to western Hubei again to assist Xu Yuanquan in handling the post-disaster relief in Shihe counties. (October 9)</p>
<h3 id="e77">A Large Batch of Ancient Shang Dynasty Artifacts Discovered in Shou County, Currently 787 Pieces Stored in the County Government, Provincial Government Orders the County to Transport Them All to the Provincial Capital for Storage <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Communication: The discovery of unearthed antiquities in Zhujiaji, Shou County, northern Anhui, has been widely rumored for a long time. A month ago, Chen Dongyuan, the director of the provincial library, submitted a request to the Department of Education to forward it to the provincial government, ordering Xi Chulin, the administrative inspector and concurrently the county magistrate of the fourth district, and also Zhu Hongchu, a local gentry, to quickly hand over all the antiquities excavated and transport them to the province for preservation. The matter was delayed for a month without a response. Subsequently, the provincial government ordered Liu Fupeng, a librarian from the library, to go to the county for investigation. He then went to investigate with County Commissioner Wu Ziming and others. It is said that the place where the villagers excavated this time is called Li San Gu Dui. Since the end of the second month of the old lunar calendar to the fifth leap month of this year, more than 150 villagers jointly elected eleven people as team leaders and cooperated in excavation for more than three months. They dug a pit more than six or seven zhang deep and more than two zhang in diameter, with a total of three layers inside, separated by large pieces of wood. Each layer contained antiquities. The format should be a large underground warehouse rather than an ancient tomb. The excavated antiquities have been sold for fifty-one pieces, including sixteen bronze tripods, eight jade oxen, and five bronze jue, etc., with very high prices. The villagers only sold them for 2,995 yuan and divided them among themselves as labor and food costs. There are still a very large number of remaining antiquities scattered among local gentry and primary schools. After Liu and others inspected, registered, and sealed them, the county government took them all back. It is estimated that there are currently 787 pieces temporarily stored in the county government, including more than 20 ancient tripods, as well as large pieces of jade jue, jade bricks, and jade stones. In addition, there are daily utensils such as teacups, rice bowls, pots, basins, rulers, and stools, as well as tool utensils such as shovels, saws, knives, axes, hooks, and bores, and military utensils such as swords, spears, arrowheads, and gun molds. In general, the value of the unearthed antiquities this time and the large number of them are unprecedented in decades. It is said that one of the tripods originally had tadpole characters engraved on it, and there was a knife-engraved record of the collection time underneath, and the text was also very old. There is no doubt that it was a relic of the Shang Dynasty that was hidden during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Liu has returned to the province a few days ago and submitted a list to the provincial government. The library believes that the matter concerns ancient culture and should be organized and researched as soon as possible for the public. It has submitted a request to the provincial government for verification and instructions. The educational circles Cheng Yansheng, Yao Zhongshi, Yu Youquan, Xu Yandong, Cao Chixia, and Cheng Xiaosu also jointly submitted a request to the provincial government, requesting that the county be ordered to send all the antiquities to the province and hand them over to the library for safekeeping, so that they can be viewed by the majority of people. The provincial government yesterday replied and ordered the county to comply with the order, find ways to recover the sold antiquities, carefully transport the existing antiquities to the province, and strictly prohibit any private excavation and sale in the future.

<h3 id="e78">Shandong Provincial Government Takes Over Changshan Islands, Administrative Commissioner Zhang Xiangwu Reports to Jinan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: In the coastal area of eastern Shandong, there are numerous islands with abundant marine resources. Just in Penglai County alone, there are more than ten islands, commonly known as the "Eight Islands of Penglai," referring to the eight larger ones. Because the largest of these is Changshan Island, it is also known as the Changshan Islands. This area is located in deep sea, and transportation is inconvenient, so there are occasional threats from bandits. Five or six years ago, it was under the administration of the Bohai Navy. Now that the navy has been downsized, the administrative rights have been handed back to the Shandong Provincial Government. Chairman Han Fuqu has appointed Zhang Xiangwu, the General Commander of the Fifth Route National Army, to concurrently serve as Administrative Commissioner. After receiving the appointment, Zhang has already gone to take over and inspect the area. Yesterday (the 7th), Zhang came to Jinan from Penglai to meet with Han and report on the progress. According to Zhang, "These islands are located deep in the sea, guarding the gateway to the Bohai Sea. Changshan Island is the largest and closest to the mainland, with a north-south diameter of eighteen li and an east-west width of seven or eight li, thirty li from Penglai, and more than two thousand households. During my inspection, I visited Changshan Island, Miao Island, Daheishan Island, Xiaoheishan Island, Ji Island, Gaoshan Island, Daqin Island, Xiaoqin Island, Nancheng Huang Island, and Beicheng Huang Island. Apart from Changshan Island, which has the largest area and population, the others vary in size, with populations ranging from three to five hundred households, or dozens of households. One island has only one household, with four or five people, young and old, who live by fishing. The northernmost is Beicheng Huang Island, which is two hundred and several tens of li from Penglai County, one hundred and sixty li north of Lushun, and six hundred and eighty li from Dalian, making it closer to Shandong. These islands were originally managed by the Navy, which dispatched a counselor to manage affairs and established a public security bureau with more than forty policemen on Changshan Island. After taking over, it is planned to abolish the public security bureau to reduce the burden on the residents. If necessary, the local militia will be stationed. In the future, the expenses for the development of these islands will be planned by the provincial government, without placing the burden on the local areas. Various types of fish, sea cucumbers, and shrimp are abundant on the islands, and the products are of excellent quality." (8th)</p>

<p>In recent years, the social economy has been in a state of panic, and all industries have been in decline. The barber industry has also suffered a great decline. Recently, in order to attract customers, they have posted large red price reduction papers on the glass windows, marking the prices. Western style is 300 wen, monk's head is 200 wen, shaving is 120 wen. Business is gradually turning around, but this has caused disputes among the industry. After mediation by the county party headquarters, they still operate according to the old rules. Recently, barber shops in the Zhoushanbang Tonghui Road area have reduced prices again due to the failure of business to improve. However, the income of barber shop partners has been greatly affected, and they have unanimously expressed their opposition. The shop owners have ignored this, so all partners have issued secret signals on the night before yesterday at about 9 o'clock to carry out a strike. After receiving the report, Zhang Shiquan and Jin Yuan, members of the Barber Industry Association, were deeply afraid that the situation would expand. They held a temporary emergency meeting at the Bajie Lane Clubhouse at 2 pm yesterday (11th). More than 40 people, including Zhang Zhenhong, attended. The county party also sent Gao Zugao, an officer, to attend the mediation. After deliberation, it was decided to send representatives Zhou Shaoqin and others to the second branch of the Public Security Bureau to ask the owner of the Hengda Barber Shop, Sha Laoer, who first posted the price reduction paper, to be brought to justice. The acting director of the Cheng branch sent patrol officer Xiao Tongsheng to remove the posted papers, and advised all shops to remove all price reduction papers. However, the shops that reduced prices have very firm will. It is not known how the price reduction strike will be resolved.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the editorial "Japanese Coal and National Coal" in your newspaper on October 4 this year, the article stated that Chinese coal production has "excessively high transportation costs." It also mentioned that at the beginning of the Republic of China, state-owned railways had special pricing arrangements for coal transportation, which enabled the development of various mines in the north. However, the special prices for coal transportation were successively canceled, and all coal was uniformly classified into the sixth class. Although there have been several reductions since then, the transportation costs are still 70% to 80% higher than before. Increased transportation costs are the "reason" for the gradual reduction in Chinese coal production. This is not in accordance with the facts. Although the establishment of modern coal mines in our country dates back to the early years of Guangxu, they were poorly managed or entrusted to the wrong people, resulting in the depletion of capital and difficulty in continuing. By the last years of the Qing Dynasty, foreign capital was attracted, resulting in joint ventures. In addition to the Kailuan Mining Company at the beginning of the Republic of China, the Liugou, Lincheng, Jingxing, and Yingdong mines were all in the hands of foreigners. The Zhongxing and other mines were still in their infancy with limited production. The only mines run by Chinese were the Pingxiang, Baojin, and many small kilns. Since the reform, the Chinese have gradually recognized the necessity of independently operating mines. Foreign-funded coal mines have been recovered from time to time, and commercial coal mines have been gradually established. Small mines that originally used local methods of mining have also adopted machinery or merged into modern mines. Mines with domestic capital have only recently shown signs of revitalization. They have not been hindered in their development due to excessively high transportation costs. For example, the Liugou Mine only cleared the arrears in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and its production and sales reached more than 740,000 tons in the seventh year, setting a new record for the mine. Another example is the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which added 800,000 taels of capital in the 31st year of Guangxu, and by the 16th year of the Republic of China, its assets had reached 15 million yuan. Recently, it has planned to produce 4,000 to 6,000 tons of coal per day, becoming a large mine. Other mines in Datong, Jin, Yu, Su, Wan, Xiang, and Yue have recently been organized or are just beginning to sprout. The large mines run by Chinese are developing and have not reduced their mining due to increased transportation costs. What is regrettable is that the civil war has been frequent, coal transportation has been difficult, Pingxiang has been plagued by communist bandits and has been on the verge of bankruptcy for a long time, and coal mines in the east were once on par with foreign coal, but since the September 18th Incident, they have suddenly become objects of foreign dumping. These are all political problems and not transportation cost problems. As for transportation costs, the Ministry has always maintained a policy of protecting national coal. Railway freight is only divided into six classes, and coal is included in the lowest class, originally at the same lowest cost as mud, sand, and stone. However, in practice, the coal transportation costs of various railways vary depending on transportation conditions and cost factors. However, most coal-producing railways have special prices or discounts, often charging extremely low prices, even below the transportation costs of mud, sand, and stone, and far below transportation costs. It has never been uniformly classified into the sixth class. Recently, in order to maintain the dumping of foreign coal, the Ministry has specifically maintained it. In addition to repeatedly suspending the addition of coal transportation prices on various railways, the Pinghan, Xiang, E, Jiaoji, and Pingsui Railways have either been given special reductions or discounts. For example, the current price for transporting coal from Liugou to Hankou on the Pinghan Railway is only 5 yuan and 9 jiao per ton, and the recent special price is only 5 yuan and 3 jiao, which is still lower than the lowest special price of 5 yuan and 3 jiao and 4 fen enjoyed by the mine. If calculated according to the sixth class of goods on the railway, the charge should be 17 yuan and 7 fen. The current transportation cost is only 35% of the sixth class, and the special price is less than one-third of the sixth class. As for the old special price, it was only used for powerful large mines that started at the time when foreigners were running mines in North China, and the mines run by Chinese were not included. Now, all mines, large and small, are treated equally, and have the opportunity for balanced development. Recently, gold prices have soared, and labor and materials have increased several times. Operating expenses are far beyond what they were twenty years ago. However, the transportation costs of coal on various railways have not only not increased but have decreased. What is regrettable is that many national coal mines are located inland, and transportation is difficult. Also, due to poor management or lack of capital, production is not abundant and expenses are too heavy. The cost per ton is often several times higher than that of foreign coal or coal mined by foreign capital. Even compared to the same mine several years ago, the cost is more than double. The fundamental solution to the national coal problem lies in expanding production, reducing costs, increasing tariffs, implementing dumping taxes, and reducing various improper expenses. The coal industry operated by our country is still in its infancy and needs to be emulated and implemented to maintain it. Your newspaper is concerned about the coal industry, which is deeply appreciated. However, you may not be fully aware of the details of transportation costs. I hope you will publish this letter to prevent misunderstandings. Sincerely, Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, October 9.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Grand National Day Celebration Held the Day Before Yesterday; The City Party Department Convened a Commemorative Meeting with Representatives from All Walks of Life, Reaching Over Two Hundred People <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>For this year's Double Ten Festival, the central government, due to the national crisis, issued an order to the whole country not to be extravagant. Therefore, the City Party Department of this city convened a National Day Commemorative Meeting for representatives from all walks of life at 9:30 am on the morning of the celebration. Over two hundred people attended. The chairman, Cai Hongtian, reported on the significance of the celebration. Details of the various activities are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Singing the Party Song; (3) Giving the highest salute to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister; (4) Reading the Prime Minister's will; (5) Silent tribute; (6) Report; (7) Speech; (8) Shouting slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the rituals, the chairman reported that today is the National Day of the Republic of China, the 22nd anniversary. Twenty-two years ago, on this day, the martyrs of our Party launched an uprising in Wuchang, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China. Recalling the last three years of the Qing Dynasty, due to the corruption of the political system, it was repeatedly subjected to aggression by various imperialists, leading to the decline of people's livelihoods and the weakening of the nation. The late Prime Minister, seeing this, realized that without implementing a revolution, the country would not survive or be saved. After several struggles, with an indomitable spirit, he persevered and launched an uprising in Wuchang twenty-two years ago, and the Republic of China was established. The tenth of October was designated as National Day. This day is the most glorious day in the history of the Party and the nation, and it is worthy of our enthusiastic celebration. However, this year's National Day is faced with both external regrets and internal chaos. We were ordered not to be extravagant, so we are celebrating very simply. But the significance of celebrating National Day is not in the form. Furthermore, the Chinese nation has experienced several crises. In the past twenty-two years, we do not know how much of our good land has been lost. Now, the banditry has not yet been suppressed, and the Japanese are still inching forward step by step, repeatedly invading. Under these circumstances, the Chinese people should quickly wake up. Therefore, today, celebrating National Day means celebrating on one hand and working hard for the country on the other, jointly seeking ways to strengthen the nation and paying attention to (1) the revival of the countryside, (2) the construction of national transportation, (3) the promotion of national goods, and (4) the consolidation of national defense, etc. Then he shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: (1) Actively produce and enrich national power; (2) Suppress the Red bandits and stabilize society; (3) Prepare to recover lost territories with strength; (4) Support the government in implementing construction work; (5) Down with Japanese imperialism; (6) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (7) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Slogan Highlights: (1) October 10th is the glorious anniversary of the revival of the Chinese nation; (2) Commemorating National Day means working hard to resist Japan, avenge shame, and seek revenge; (3) Support the government and implement construction work; (4) Commemorating National Day is a commemoration of the Party's Xinhai Revolution overthrowing the Qing Dynasty; (5) Unite sincerely to ensure peace and unity; (6) Commemorating National Day means actively producing and enriching national power; (7) Commemorating National Day means not forgetting the hardships created by the Prime Minister and all the martyrs; (8) Commemorating National Day means preparing to recover lost territories; (9) Commemorating National Day means suppressing the Red bandits and stabilizing society; (10) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (11) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The new Shanghai Municipal Government Building, was first established on July 7, 1931, when Zhang Yuejun was the mayor of Shanghai. The construction plan, were all decided during this time, so Zhang was extremely concerned about the construction of the central urban area. Zhang, who is currently the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was unable to come to Shanghai, so he specially sent the mayor of Hankou, Wu Guozhen, as a representative to participate in the completion ceremony. Wu came to Shanghai the night before yesterday, bringing a large silver cup presented by former Mayor Zhang to celebrate the completion ceremony. Mayor Wu held a banquet last night to welcome him.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Mayor's Report on Construction Plans <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Distinguished guests, today the Shanghai Municipal Government is holding a ceremony for the completion of its new building, and we are greatly honored by the presence and guidance of Chinese and foreign guests. I have been in charge of this city for less than two years. At the beginning of my tenure, I encountered the Shanghai Incident. I have tried my best to be loyal and to cope with the difficulties. I am grateful for the joint cooperation and assistance of local worthies and foreign friends, which has fortunately restored peace to Shanghai and stabilized the order of the city. As we hold such a grand ceremony here today, recalling the painful past years, I still feel infinitely saddened. Entrusted with heavy responsibilities by the Party and the State, and with the earnest expectations of the citizens, I have never dared to forget the suffering of my citizens in this difficult and arduous process, and I have never ceased to actively plan the restoration of the war zone. Day and night, I have strived to do my best for the welfare of my citizens and the relief of my disaster-stricken people. All kinds of plans have been drafted or implemented. Although there have been no special achievements due to financial and time constraints, I will always strive to live up to the expectations of my citizens. As for the difficult construction process of the new municipal building and its profound and great significance, I have given a detailed and thorough account in my article "The Starting Point and Significance of the Construction of the Central District of Shanghai," which was published in today's newspapers. Here, I can only briefly explain my feelings in a few points. First, the construction of Greater Shanghai is based on the construction plan of our Party's General Secretary. The construction of the central district is the first step towards completing the plan for Greater Shanghai. The completion of the new municipal government building today is the starting point for the construction of the central district. Each of the previous mayors of Greater Shanghai, Mr. Huang Yingbai, Mr. Zhang Boxuan, and Mr. Zhang Yuejun, painstakingly planned and painstakingly managed the project. The results of their efforts have created the rudimentary form of today. Today, on the one hand, I represent the citizens in expressing my respect to the previous mayors, and on the other hand, I will carry on the spirit of the previous mayors and strive to engage in the construction of Greater Shanghai in order to realize the legacy of General Secretary. (Top) Mayor Wu and his wife (photographed by Xu Tianzhang) (Bottom) Military police regiment parade (photographed by Qichang Photo Studio)</p>
<p>Second, given the complexity and scale of the Greater Shanghai plan, the new municipal government building can only be considered a drop in the ocean. However, the current location of the city center, close to Wusong in the north, bordering the concession in the south, facing the Huangpu River in the east, and adjacent to the railway in the west, is strategically located and conveniently accessible. In the years to come, there will be considerable development and prosperity. I sincerely hope that the citizens of Shanghai will have confidence in themselves and not rely on the already established constructions of others. We should rise up and create a new world of prosperity and development, so as to demonstrate the inherent creative cultural capacity of our Chinese nation. Observing the past efforts of the citizens of Shanghai in the construction of Shanghai, I also firmly believe that in the future, we will be able to make this city the most sound and prosperous metropolis. Third, Shanghai is the center of national economy and culture, and also one of the world's major cities. China is now in the process of construction. On the negative side, we should eliminate all obstacles to construction. On the positive side, we should actively plan the advancement of the new China's construction plan. The most important aspect of the construction of the new China,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>is nothing more than the development of politics and economy. The characteristics of a city are that on the one hand, it is the birthplace of a country's democratic politics, and on the other hand, it is the driving force behind a country's economic development. The prosperity of Greater Shanghai is related to the success or failure of the national construction, and it is also a sign of China's future prosperity and strength. I am willing to work together with the citizens of Jinshi to promote the rapid development of Greater Shanghai and its increasing prosperity. I wish Shanghai a long life, the Chinese Kuomintang a long life, and the Republic of China a long life.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Mayor Inspects Troops, Impressive Military Appearance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by inspecting officers Yang Hu, Wen Hongen, Wang Yiting, Wang Binyan, etc., ascended the command platform and began the troop inspection. First, Commander Qi Xueqi reported the number of troops to Inspecting Officer, then Inspecting Officer Mayor Wu, accompanying Inspecting Officer Yang Huchang (Hu), Director Wen (Hongen), Deputy Adjutant Wen (Jiangang), and Wang Binyan, head of the Security Regiment, conducted an inspection. Then, they returned to the command platform. The Mayor stood in the center, with the accompanying Inspecting Officers lined up on the left and right. After the Commander issued the order, military music was played, and the military police marched forward in formation, passing in front of the command platform for a review. The inspected troops included: First group, two platoons of training soldiers from the Security Department; Second group, the first infantry regiment of the Security Department, one platoon of Mauser pistol soldiers; Third group, one platoon of pursuit artillery from the Security Department; Fourth group, one platoon of armored bicycle soldiers from the Security Department; Fifth group, two platoons of infantry from the Public Security Bureau's police brigade, one platoon of machine gunners; Sixth group, two battalions of the Security Regiment. The city's boy scouts and firefighters also joined the inspection. Finally, the parade was concluded with a procession promoting domestic products. During the inspection, Chinese and foreign guests were present to watch, with Western guests on the right and Chinese guests on the left. All the military police were neatly dressed, in high spirits, and marched in a very orderly manner, making for an impressive military appearance.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Ceremony Concludes with Cheers of "Long Live" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the troop inspection was completed, music was played and the ceremony concluded. Then, Mayor Wu led everyone in chanting "Long Live Shanghai," "Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang," and "Long Live the Republic of China." After the cheers, Chinese and foreign guests returned to their respective homes.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Firefighting Demonstration Showcases Excellent Skills <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In addition to participating in the parade, the city's fire brigades also demonstrated their skills in the square in front of the city government at 2 PM in the afternoon. In advance, two four-story high buildings were erected with reed mats on the open space. During the demonstration, thirty gallons of gasoline were poured on them, and the buildings were filled with flammable materials. Some firefighters, disguised as residents, were pre-positioned inside the buildings and set off sulfur gunpowder. In an instant, thick smoke billowed from each window, and flames soared into the sky, as if thousands of fire dragons were rising into the air. The fire was fierce, and the firefighters worked hard to install hoses and carry out rescue operations. Other firefighters used ladders to jump into the windows and rescue the disguised residents pre-positioned in the buildings. Some firefighters climbed onto the roof and used water to extinguish the fire. One firefighter jumped down from a high place to rescue people. After about half an hour, the fire was completely extinguished, and the audience applauded continuously, which showed the progress of the city's firefighting efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Mayor's Speech: Service and Sacrifice <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>After the firefighting demonstration, Mayor Wu convened all the firefighters and gave a speech.</p>
<p>He said that the Shanghai Fire Brigade is one of the citizens' autonomous organizations and has a long history. Since the establishment of the municipal government, it has assisted us and made remarkable achievements. The spirit of the Fire Brigade is one of service and one of sacrifice. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will always adhere to the spirit of service and sacrifice in their efforts to establish fire brigades, complete autonomy, assist in the construction of a new Shanghai, and then build a new China. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, and it has a great responsibility to the country. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will take the task of saving the country as their own responsibility.</p>

<p>After the meeting was opened, Chairman Tong Xingbai gave a report, which briefly stated that today is the 37th anniversary of the General Secretary's ordeal in London. It is very meaningful and worthy of commemoration that the General Secretary was arrested at this time 37 years ago. Why did the General Secretary suffer an ordeal in London? It was to seek the revival of the nation, which aroused the jealousy of the Qing government. Before the ordeal, the General Secretary was working hard on the revolution, so the Qing government wanted to capture him at any cost. Therefore, he fled overseas to (Continued on page 15)</p>

<p>the United States. The Qing government learned of this and telegraphed its ambassador to the United States to arrest the General Secretary. The General Secretary then went to London, and the ambassador to the United States telegraphed the ambassador to England to arrest the General Secretary nearby. The General Secretary was arrested, but by chance, the General Secretary had a friend, Kang Deli, who lived near the embassy. The General Secretary wrote a note and threw it outside the wall, but no one picked it up and sent it, and it was detected by the Qing envoy, who stepped up precautions. At this point, all hope was lost, and all that was left was to pray to God. Later, he met an English servant in the embassy, Cole, and asked him and his wife to take the letter to Kang Deli for help. Kang traveled for two days and two nights before spreading the news throughout the city, and public opinion was in an uproar. The British government then negotiated with the Qing envoy for his release and restoration of freedom, but he had been detained for 13 days. The General Secretary was even more interested in political activities and felt a great sense of calling because of his ordeal in London. Secondly, 37 years ago was the General Secretary's ordeal, and now it is the nation's ordeal. The General Secretary still had Kang Deli to rescue him. Now, isn't it we who are responsible for saving the country? At present, the government is implementing controlled economy to solve the national crisis. However, the central power cannot control the whole country. If the politics is like this, of course there is no question of controlled economy. Therefore, the only way to solve the current national crisis is to cultivate a strong central power and create an omnipotent government to solve all the current obstacles. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>New loan negotiations with the banking community using surplus New Treasury Bonds as collateral. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen was originally scheduled to take a flight to Nanjing on the morning of the 9th to attend a meeting of the Executive Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek's Sikorsky aircraft was also ordered to come to Shanghai on the 8th to await Minister Song's arrival. It is now known that Mr. Song has been conducting various important financial matters in Shanghai for days and has not yet finished. He will not be able to leave Shanghai within the next few days, and it will probably have to be postponed until the beginning of next week before he can go to Nanjing.</p>
<p>According to New Sound News Agency, the Ministry of Finance issued 100 million yuan of Customs Treasury Bonds of the Republic of China in 1933. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen is in contact with the banking community in Shanghai to use the New Treasury Bonds to repay the temporary loans of various banks, and to conduct new loan negotiations. According to reliable sources in the banking community yesterday, the loan negotiations have been largely completed. The total amount is 12 million yuan, which will be undertaken separately by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Salt Bank, the Continental Bank, and the Jincheng Bank, and will be secured by the remaining amount of the New Treasury Bonds. However, the exact amount is still under discussion and may need to be increased to 15 million yuan.</p>

<p>After the motorcade parade, the conference staff rushed to the City Chamber of Commerce. The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 PM. Luo Qinghua of the City Chamber of Commerce, Chen Yiting of the National Products Promotion Association, and representatives from various agencies, groups, and guests from all walks of life, more than 800 people, attended. After the meeting, Wu Huanru, the second section chief of the City Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. He said, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to hold the National Products Movement Week ceremony. If we think about it carefully, we can't help but feel heartache. The people of a country should in principle use their own country's products. But in today's China, it is necessary to hold a sports conference for people to use national products. Isn't this a heartbreaking thing? Because of China's poverty, all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce are seeking a way out. We must know that the alias for a way out is to solve the problem of eating. But judging from today's situation in China, where people like to use foreign goods, it is no wonder that all industries cannot be revitalized, and it is no wonder that all industries have no way out, and the problem of eating for all industries cannot be solved. On the contrary, if China can love its country and all consumption is determined to buy only national products, then at least tens of millions of yuan of foreign goods can be stopped every year. With this sum of money, how many businesses can be run and how many people in the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors can solve the problem of eating? Therefore, at this time of national crisis, we cannot only hate the enemy's barbarity and ferocity. We must know that under today's circumstances, the Japanese are armed to the teeth because their people love their country. Therefore, if we want to eliminate this national crisis, we must love our country, and the way to love our country must start with loving and using national products." When the first National Products Movement Week was held in this city, many people said that the Chinese people's love for foreign goods is a habit, and it is not easy to change customs. But if we are fair, after several years of holding enthusiastic national products conferences, not only the citizens of this city, but also the people of the whole country, have gradually been able to arouse the concept of loving and using national products. The capitalists who invest in domestic product factories and those who run domestic product businesses are also more than in the past. It is not a good phenomenon. Only because the Chinese people's habit of loving and using national products has not yet become universal, the future of national products still has no significant acceleration. Therefore, whenever this bureau holds a National Products Movement Week, it must hold a National Products Exhibition in conjunction with it. The purpose is not only to change consumers' bad habits of using foreign goods, but also to promote producers' determination to improve and work hard to manufacture. In this movement week, in addition to motorcade parades and other programs, there is still an exhibition. The location is in the Confucius Temple Park in Xiaoximen, Nanshi. The purpose is nothing more than to cultivate the habit of loving and using national products among all circles." After the chairman's report, Luo Qinghua, the representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, which briefly stated, "Everyone, today is the National Day celebration, which you all know. This period is a period of national crisis, which you also understand. Today, at this time, we are holding the National Products Movement Week here, which you also understand. Therefore, today, I will briefly talk about the relationship between the National Day, the national crisis, and the National Products Movement. We recall that before September 18th of the year before last, there were still some things to celebrate every National Day. After September 18th, the January 28th Incident followed, and then the loss of Rehe and the signing of the Tanggu Truce. The national crisis deepened day by day. Since then, every time we celebrate the National Day, not only is there nothing to celebrate, but also several huge and deep wounds are added. If the Chinese people cannot work hard, the national crisis may increase every day, and there will never be a chance to commemorate the National Day. Therefore, if we want to save the national crisis, we should not want to have a good time on the National Day. Otherwise, we should all work hard and make it our goal to love the country, and the way to love the country should be to love and use national products." Then Zhang Renshi, the curator of the National Products Exhibition Hall, and Ling Yun, the representative of the Shanghai National Products Company, gave speeches. After the speeches, they continued to perform to help the fun. The programs included "Didi" and "Jiangcun Xiaojing" by the Shanghai Commercial News Drama Troupe, all of which were designed to promote national products in the entertainment and arouse the interest of all circles, and the meeting did not end until about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station received a report from Qian Jinfa, a chauffeur from the Public Works Department. He stated that while passing the Qiwupu Road pier, he discovered a pool of fresh blood containing three severed fingers. He also found a trail of blood leading directly to the Huangpu River, along with three incense sticks with a paper from a lottery shop stuck in them. Upon receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and confirmed the report. However, the body was missing, presumed to have sunk to the bottom of the river. They notified the Water Police to be on the lookout for a floating corpse. At around 1:00 PM, a body was found floating near the Weituoma Road intersection. It was retrieved from the water, and the Yulin Road Police Station was notified for identification. The station then dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The body was dressed in a black serge long gown, black woolen trousers, a white cotton short shirt, and a white cloth undershirt. It was confirmed that the hands were missing three fingers, and the severed fingers matched the wounds. A notebook found near the body contained a personal statement with the name “Shuai Shuchun,” age 29, father alive, mother deceased, one younger brother who is married but childless. It included only a few words and a telephone number. Further examination of the body revealed over a dozen fatal wounds on the head and body, indicating murder followed by disposal in the Huangpu River. The body was immediately transported to the coroner’s office, and detectives were dispatched to investigate the crime and apprehend the perpetrator.</p>

<p>A bride runs away two days after the wedding. The groom is miserable, left with the name but not the reality. The bride was nearly abducted to Dalian. Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the relief association, were patrolling the docks along the Pudong riverfront at 3:00 AM yesterday morning, amidst the darkness and biting wind, to investigate any potential abduction cases on ships. On the Lian Yu steamer, which was bound for Yingkou and Dalian, at the Longmao pier, they saw a man escorting a young woman. The man spoke with a Northern accent, while the woman spoke with a Southern accent, so they asked them questions. The two claimed to be husband and wife, but their stories did not align. So, they coordinated with Bao Tan Shen Changshan from the Water Police to bring the pair to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, the woman, aged 16, from Chongming, stated that her father's name was Shi Xiangwan. She had been betrothed since childhood to Yu Amao, the son of farmer Yu Laosan from Miaotouzhen, Zhabei District. Amao was 18 years old this year, and they were married on September 21st (August 2nd of the lunar calendar). However, her husband was base and repulsive, with an unbearable stench, so although they shared a bed after marriage, they did not consummate it. As a result, on the 24th of the same month, the third day after the wedding, she ran away. On the 5th of this month (the 16th of the lunar calendar), at 3:00 PM, she went alone to the New World company to look for her husband's younger female relatives to play with. She met this man, who gave his surname as Shi, but his given name was unknown. At 7:00 or 8:00 PM in front of the company, this man asked about her background and offered to take her to his home. They went to a hotel near Nichengqiao, but she didn't remember the room number. They stayed there for four or five days. On the first night, she was forced to take off her clothes and could not resist. She was raped seven times over the course of four or five days. Yesterday, this man asked her to go with him to Dalian to find a friend and borrow money to rent a place. He told her to say that she was his wife, 18 years old, and married last March, if anyone asked along the way or on the ship. They boarded a ship on the Huangpu River at 3:00 PM. The man's name was Shi Jinsheng, 27 years old, from Shandong, and he was unemployed. He was staying at the home of his friend Yang Jinhai on Maigen Road. He said he met the girl in front of the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road six or seven days ago, at 6:00 or 7:00 PM. He asked who she was with, and the girl said it was her brother. He invited her to go see a play, but she refused. Later, he took her to the room he had rented and raped her. They stayed there for three days, then moved to the Hongxiang Hotel, room 18, for another three days, for a total of six days. He raped her six or seven times. Yesterday, he took her on the Lianxing steamer to Dalian to find his friend Guo Chengxiang. When asked where in Dalian, he said he did not know. When asked where he got the money to go to Dalian, he said he pawned his clothes. He was ordered to be detained. Meanwhile, the investigators went to Zhabei to inform Yu Amao and Yu Laosan, who confirmed that the girl had indeed run away just two days after the wedding and that the marriage had not been consummated. They suspected that the tenant Qiu Xilin had abducted the girl after she ran away, so they had filed a complaint in the Fourth District, and the case had been transferred to the court for review. The police chief reviewed the statements and prepared a document recording the statements, which was transferred to the District Court for interrogation. After the prosecutor reviewed the case, he ordered the girl to be released to her family, and the defendant was detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Yang Xuefang, a 13-year-old girl from Pinghu, came to Shanghai with her mother at the beginning of this month to visit relatives, the Yao Yang family, at No. 1 Guling Road. On the 5th, Yang Xuefang suddenly disappeared. After Yao Yang searched everywhere without success, she reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station on the 6th, requesting their assistance in the search. She also distributed leaflets and posted a reward in the newspaper, offering 100 yuan to anyone who could bring Yang Xuefang back. Feng Bingsheng, a man from Changzhou, was destitute and wandering in Shanghai. After seeing the advertisement, he had a whimsical idea and saw it as a great opportunity. He forged a letter from the Hangzhou City Station Inspection Office, dressed in an old gray uniform, and impersonated a soldier from the office. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, he went directly to the Yao Yang family, took out the letter, and claimed that the girl Yang Xuefang had been abducted by an old woman, about 50 years old, and taken by train to Hangzhou. She was discovered by the Inspection Office at the Hangzhou station and is now being held in custody. He was specially dispatched to Shanghai with the letter to notify them. If they wanted to send the girl back to Shanghai, they could. Yao Yang was overjoyed and begged Feng to send the girl back to Shanghai, offering him two yuan for travel expenses. Feng agreed and promised to bring Yang back at 4:00 PM the following day, and to collect the reward of 100 yuan. On the evening of Double Ten Day, Feng returned and took out another letter from Zhang Chuan, the captain of the Inspection Office, requesting that everything in the letter be followed. After reading the letter, Yao Yang realized that it stated that the old woman and the girl would be sent to the First Special District Court in Shanghai for interrogation, and that all travel expenses to and from Shanghai and Hangzhou must be borne by the family. After reading the letter, Yao Yang realized that Feng's actions were just empty words to deceive and extort money. She secretly reported to the police, and detective Li Wenzhao was sent to arrest Feng Bingsheng and the two letters, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the case and requested that he be sentenced for fraud and forgery under Articles 363 and 214 of the Criminal Law. Yao Yang also testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Questioned, the defendant admitted that he had been persuaded by his friend Wang Xiang to take this action and claimed that he was not a vulgar person. He said that he had graduated from university and then attended military academy. He had once served in the military.

<p>Although the fetus is aborted, the life is in danger. Old woman Ji Guo is detained pending investigation.</p>
<p>Zhu Aqiao, a 20-year-old woman from Hangzhou, who is quite beautiful, lives at No. 63 Renshou Lane, Baker Road. She works as a worker in the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory in nearby Chunyang Lane. She recently fell in love with Xu Wenyao, the accountant of the factory.</p>
<p>They have an affair and she becomes pregnant. The woman is deeply afraid that her secret will be revealed and that her brother, Zhiyuan, will find out, which would be embarrassing for everyone involved. She and Xu discussed the matter and asked someone to perform an abortion. Zhu, a friend of Xu Wenyao, introduced the old woman Ji Guo from Zhabei, a Chinese area, to her. On the first of this month, in the bedroom of her friend Qian Jinmei's house at No. 51 Baker Road, it was agreed that the abortion fee would be nine yuan. An herb root, about four inches long, was inserted into Zhu's uterus. The fetus was aborted the next day, but the woman's body was exhausted. She went to the hospital for treatment. The matter was discovered by detective Zhang Degong of the Yulin Road Police Station. He arrested Ji Guo, who performed the abortion, on Xiaoshadu Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Xiephan interrogated her. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the police had sent detectives to the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory to investigate. According to the factory, Xu Wenyao was an apprentice and had now fled without a trace. They also went to Qian Jinmei's place to inquire, and Qian said that she also worked in the factory, and that she did not know anything about Zhu Aqiao's abortion in her house, because she was working the night shift at the factory at the time. Therefore, the police did not prosecute her. The police found that Zhu was currently being treated at Guangren Hospital, and that her condition was quite serious, and that her life may be in danger. They requested a postponement. He then presented a similar herb for inspection. Zhu Zhengyuan also stated the facts of the case. When questioned, the defendant Ji Guo denied everything. Judge Xiao reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e129">A Fierce Fight Between a Bengal Circus Tiger Mother and Son <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>During a performance on Monday night at the Haijingbo Circus, two Bengal tigers suddenly became ferocious and engaged in a fierce fight. The tiger trainers and other circus members were at a loss for what to do. They immediately fired blank shots as a warning to stop the fighting. The audience was greatly frightened. After the fight, it was discovered that the largest female tiger, named (Muxue), had been clawed in many places by her combative son (Shangjiao).</p>
<p>According to Ma Xishi, the tiger trainer, Muxue is actually very fierce. He recalled that two years ago in Vienna, Muxue gave birth to three cubs, but for some reason, she became ferocious and swallowed two of them. Shangjiao was rescued by Ma Xishi, who risked his life to reach into the tiger cage. According to reports, Muxue was carried on Ma's back during the performance on Monday night. When her son Shangjiao was walking into the cage, Muxue jumped at him, and the fierce fight began. Fortunately, it was stopped in time, and there were no major injuries.</p>
<p>Muxue has claw marks in many places and will not perform again until she has recovered. Ma Xishi is a beautiful and world-renowned tiger training master. His body has many claw and tooth marks from tigers, which shows how difficult it is to train tigers. Sai Huijun, the general manager of the circus, said that mother-son fights have occurred many times, and the audience does not need to panic, because the tiger cages in the circus are made of iron bars, and the tigers will definitely not escape and injure people during the fight. The Haijingbo Zoo opened yesterday, and visitors were very enthusiastic. The world's smallest Shetland pony is about to give birth, and the size of its offspring will be incredibly small. If the foal is healthy after birth, the Haijingbo boss will present it to the daughter of Mayor Wu to show his respect.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Naval Veteran Sa Zhenbing Arrives in Shanghai He is 73 Years Old and Comes to Discuss Hometown Disaster Relief and Stay with Relatives on Yuyuan Road <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Naval veteran Sa Zhenbing has retired from his political career and lives at home, dedicating himself to disaster relief work. Previously, the Northern Warlord Zhang Yi burned and looted over a hundred villages in the Nangan area of Fuzhou, turning fields and houses into ruins. Sa Zhenbing personally traveled around, raising large sums of money, which not only restored the villages after the war but also provided infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and sanitation facilities that were unprecedented in any village. To this day, the 113 villages in the Nangan area regard Sa Zhenbing as a living Buddha. Since then, whenever there were floods or wars in Changle and Longyan counties, Sa Zhenbing single-handedly took responsibility for providing disaster relief. Even in remote areas with malaria and savage customs, Sa Zhenbing traveled alone without a single servant. Even in border areas infested with bandits, Sa Zhenbing, at the age of seventy, traveled among them. The bandits, moved by his sincerity in benefiting the people, respected him as a deity and did not harm him. Sa Zhenbing's lifestyle is like that of a farmer. He eats three meals a day, mostly wild vegetables and sweet potatoes provided by woodsmen and mountain people. His son, Fu Jun, serves as a director in the Ministry of Railways and has repeatedly invited him to live in the capital, but Sa Zhenbing always dismisses the idea with a smile, regarding the disaster-stricken areas as paradise and eating coarse food as delicacies. This year, he is 73 years old, but he is still energetic and walks briskly, looking like a man in his sixties. Recently, the communists captured northern Fujian, causing great suffering to the local area. Sa Zhenbing has once again appealed to various parties to raise funds for disaster relief. He happened to meet Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman, in Fujian and personally visited him, urging him to donate money. Hu Wenhu also readily agreed. However, Fujian Province has suffered repeated disasters, and all the villages and cities are in ruins, making it very difficult to raise funds locally. Therefore, Sa Zhenbing arrived in Shanghai on the Wanxiang merchant ship the day before yesterday and is staying with relatives on Yuyuan Road. He will soon visit wealthy individuals to request donations for disaster relief in Fujian. After negotiating the details, he will return to Fujian to oversee everything.</p>

<p>On the second day of the National Games, the sky was overcast. Ticket sales began at various venues, resulting in a smaller audience than on the first day. However, all events except for the equestrian performance were held as scheduled, and the results were excellent. The national track and field records will be completely shaken. Liu Changchun's 100-meter race even equaled the Far Eastern record. Many other national records were broken. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Overcast Skies in Capital Yesterday Reduced Audience <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) Ball games began at 8:00 AM on the 11th. The track and field semi-finals that were not completed on the afternoon of the 10th also began at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The sky was overcast, with a slight glimpse of sunlight. Due to the impact of ticket purchases, the audience was not as large as in the morning. The large clock in the stadium stopped running. The entire lighting system for the National Games on the 10th suddenly went out. The audience yesterday afternoon was slightly larger than in the morning, but it was far less than that of the 10th.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th) Yesterday afternoon's track and field finals were all exciting. The gathering of heroes, fierce competition, and intense interest were secondary to the continuous appearance of new national records. The old records were swept away like fallen leaves in the wind. Liu Changchun, a short-distance runner who attended the World Games, defeated heroes from the north and south in the 100-meter race, breaking his own national record of 10.8 seconds with a time of 10.7 seconds and equaling the Far Eastern record of Filipino Nepomuceno in the Far Eastern Games. This is truly a great achievement for China's track and field in modern times. Liu achieved this record after returning from the World Games, which can be said to be a benefit of this trip and also to comfort the people of the country. However, compared to the recent time of 10.4 seconds achieved by Japanese Yoshioka Takatoshi, there is still a gap. It is hoped that Liu will continue to work hard.</p>

<p>55.2 seconds</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) In the preliminary round of the women's 400-meter relay, the Guangdong team achieved a time of 55.2 seconds, breaking the national record. In the first group of the women's 400-meter relay preliminary round, the competitors were Guangdong, Shanghai, and Shandong. At the start, the Shanghai team took the lead, with Qian Hangsu running the first leg and Li Baohui running the second leg. In the third leg, at the handover to Li Yinan, the baton was delayed, and the Guangdong team overtook them. The Guangdong team set a new national record with a time of 55.1 seconds. The team members were Zhao Yunshan, Li Yuanfen, Zhang Jieqiong, and Chen Cuilan. In the first group, the participants were Henan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Hunan, Anhui, and Beiping. Qingdao took the lead all the way, but unfortunately, in the third leg, they dropped the baton and could not catch up. The Nanjing team won the championship. The team members were Hu Ruisheng, Liu Yulan, Yuan Chengliang, and Zhou Yueying. The results of the two groups are as follows: first group, Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong, 55.2 seconds; second group, Nanjing, Henan, Beiping, 58.4 seconds.</p>

<p>In the 100-meter final, Liu Changchun won by a margin of ten meters. The final was a gathering of famous athletes and attracted considerable attention. It was the first event held on the afternoon of the eleventh. Spectators crowded at the finish line, and the press box was packed, with everyone focused intently. Guangdong's Zhong Lianji and Liaoning's Liu Changchun were the targets of the audience's gaze. Shanghai's Cheng Jinguan, Su Xiaoru, and others were also famous heroes of the time, all warming up on the field. Suddenly, the starting gun fired. In the crowd, it was difficult to discern who was in the lead initially, but after 50 meters, the athletes' abilities began to differentiate. Liu Changchun, like a horse freed from its reins, sprinted forward. Shanghai's Cheng Jinguan and Hebei's Zhao Jinglin followed closely. In the final stretch, Liu took the lead by five meters, achieving an astonishing time of 10.7 seconds, breaking his own national record of 10.8 seconds, which he had held for a year, and equaling the Far Eastern Games record. This was truly commendable. Guangdong's two leading athletes, Zhong Lianji and others, failed to qualify. Shanghai's Cheng and Hao came in third and fourth place respectively, while Su Xiaoru fell midway and was eliminated.</p>

<p>In the high hurdles final, Shanghai's star Chen Jiayou did not participate, missing the chance to compete against the best athletes from the north and south, which was quite regrettable. This event was full of talent. In the semi-finals on the morning of the eleventh, Hangzhou National Games high hurdles champion, Fujian's Lin Shaozhou, Guangdong's Huang Yingwei, and Shanghai's Nai Dinghua competed fiercely in the same group. Lin broke the national record with 16.4 seconds. Beijing's Liu Yingjun, Chen Ling from Shanghai, and Liu Renxiu from Liaoning were in the same group, making it even more exciting. Liu also broke the national record with 16.3 seconds. A fierce battle in the final was inevitable. It started in the afternoon, with eight athletes competing side by side in a line, each displaying good form, which was quite a sight to behold. Lin and Liu were the most competitive, remaining closely matched, making it difficult to determine who was ahead until the final sprint after the last hurdle. Lin was stronger, while Liu was weaker. Lin further shortened the new record he had set in the preliminary and semi-final rounds, creating an unprecedented great new national record with 16.2 seconds.</p>

<p>The 1500-meter final was a grand spectacle, held to the accompaniment of gentle music. In the first lap, Shanxi's Gu Desheng led, followed closely by Lu Daoxian, and Hebei's Zheng Sen. Shanghai's Dong Shuzhao was in third place, with the rest following in single file, forming a line. By the second lap, Dong Shuzhao had briefly taken the lead, but was soon overtaken by Peng Renbian. At this point, Zheng Sen was in fourth place, conserving his strength. In the final lap, in the last 500 meters, Zheng Sen truly surpassed the others, leading by five meters. Zhao Lianren moved into second place, while Dong Shuzhao was in third. In the last ten meters, Dong Shuzhao was overtaken by Shandong's Lü Changgeng, dropping to fourth. Zheng Sen's time was 4 minutes, 21.5 seconds, breaking the national record.</p>

<p>The women's 50-meter final was held after the men's 100 meters. The atmosphere was extremely tense. At the start, all the athletes were neck and neck, making it impossible to distinguish who was ahead. At the finish line, the differences were also minimal. Guangdong's Zhang Jieqiong, Li Yuanfen, and Zhao Yunshan swept the top three spots. Ping Landiqing came in fourth place, with a time of 6.9 seconds, breaking the national record. Shanghai's Li Baohui and Xiao Yingjie finished in seventh and eighth place, while Chen Shuqing was eliminated in the semi-finals.</p>

<p>In the women's 200-meter final, Shanghai's Qian Hangsu, mindful of her poor performance in the preliminary round on the tenth, made a determined effort to improve and aimed to break the national record. As expected, she conserved her energy and made a stunning performance, creating an unprecedented time of 27.6 seconds, comparable to Liu Changchun's achievements. In the three groups of the semi-finals on the morning of the eleventh, all broke the national record. Beijing's Liu Yulan achieved 28.7 seconds, Shanghai's Qian Hangsu 27.9 seconds, and Shandong's Yu Xiulan 28.5 seconds. As for the championship in the final, there was no doubt that Qian would succeed. She further shortened her own time, making 27.6 seconds. This was extremely valuable. Yu Xiulan came in second, while Fujian's Xu Meiying, who lost to Qian in the semi-finals, came in fourth. Ping Jian Diqing, who lost to Yu in the semi-finals, came in third. Beijing's Liu Yulan, who came in first in the first group of the semi-finals, and Guangdong's Liu Youqing, who came in second, both failed to qualify in the final.</p>

<p>Hao Chunde made a stunning performance, creating a new long jump record with 6.912 meters. There were as many as 65 participants in the long jump competition, but 28 failed to show up. In the first jump, Shanghai's Hao Chunde and Wang Jihuai immediately set astonishing records of 6.912 meters and 6.73 meters, respectively, which were praised by representatives from other units. In the second jump, Jiangsu's Zhang Jiakui jumped 6.803 meters, breaking the national record along with Hao Chunde. There was not much improvement in the subsequent jumps. After three jumps, six athletes were selected for the final. Those who qualified were Jiangsu's Wang Hongjin, Zhang Jiakui, Shanghai's Hao Chunde, Wang Jihuai, Guangdong's Wang Wenxian, and Beijing's Liang... However, the outcome was already determined and difficult to change. After six jumps, the top three positions had already been decided. Hao Chunde is 29 years old this year, a student at Jinan University, and a sports star in Shanghai for the past five years. He won first place in the pentathlon and fourth place in the 100 meters at the last National Games. His performance was not outstanding. Later, Hao attended the Far Eastern Games but did not achieve much. In the past two years, Hao had not participated in any sports meet due to his declining performance. This year, Hao made a comeback at the Shanghai Municipal Games, winning the long jump and javelin throw. He then broke the long jump record at the National Games, demonstrating that Hao's ambition was not to be outdone by others. His stunning performance was commendable. If he can maintain this level, there is hope for the Far Eastern Games.</p>

<p>Lu Ming's ambition was realized. Since participating in the 9th Far Eastern Games, Lu Ming had practiced diligently with the 16-pound shot put. He had also stated to reporters in Shanghai that he would achieve a result of over 12 meters at the next National Games. This time, he won the championship with 11.19 meters, demonstrating that ambition can lead to success. However, this result did not break the national record, which was disappointing. The reason for this lack of outstanding performance was due to the uneven ground and poor diet. If the ground had been smoother, Lu's result would have been around 11.50 meters.</p>

<p>In the men's discus final, Zhang... achieved 34.84 meters, Leng Peigen from Beijing came in second with 34.48 meters, Gong Wan... came in third with 34.08 meters, and Liu Renxiu from Liaoning came in fourth with 32.29 meters. After the referees placed the flags indicating the various records, the competition began. In the first throw, it was noticed that the coal... in the throwing circle was not very firm. By the third throw, it had become... unrecognizable, making it difficult for the athletes. Athletes felt that it was unusually difficult, and many crossed the line. The results were mostly from the first three throws, so the outcome was poor. The result was far from the national record of 36.50 meters by one meter, which was truly disappointing. Chen Tieniu, who had a high reputation, failed to qualify even in the preliminary round, which was truly inexplicable.</p>

<p>In the women's javelin final, Shanghai's famous thrower Chen Rongming's championship was as steady as Mount Tai. However, her performance was much worse than the Shanghai Municipal Games. Today, she won the championship with 26.38 meters, which was still far from the 27.75 meters at the Shanghai Municipal Games. The second and third place results both surpassed the old national record. Yu Liu Zhongwen came in second with 24.56 meters, Yu Yuan Hengrui came in third with 24.52 meters, and Min Chen Rongtang came in fourth with 21.155 meters.</p>
<p>This was the first women's javelin event in the National Games, so the number of participants from various units was not large, totaling only 39 people, and many were absent. Most of the running and throwing postures were not correct. Shanghai's Chen Rongming is a well-known figure in women's basketball. Her height, strength, and power are rare among women. Therefore, in the first throw, she achieved 26.38 meters, leaving the women from the other 22 units far behind. After three throws, six athletes were selected for the final: Li Shufang (Guangzhou), Chen Rongming (Shanghai), Gan Hongying (Shanghai), Liu Zhongwen (Henan), Yuan Hengrui (Henan), and Chen Rongtang (Fujian). As a result, Chen Rongming (Shanghai) won the championship with 26.38 meters.</p>

<p>Shandong's Zhu Tianzhen, who held the national record of 1.255 meters, was expected to win the championship, but not only did she fail to win, she did not even place. Shanghai's high jump champion, Zou Shande, won the championship with 1.28 meters, greatly improving her own performance. Wang Huachang from Shanghai also came in second. Zou's vaulting posture was excellent, unmatched in the entire venue, and she could be trained in the straddle technique. However, her straight jump was still lacking. It was a pity that Ji Wang Shuzhen, one of the last seven or eight people, ducked back under the bar after jumping over it, resulting in a foul. Despite repeated attempts, she failed to clear the bar and was eliminated. Zhu Dazhen's body was overweight, making her jumps less agile, which led to her elimination. When the bar was at 1.24 meters, there were still four athletes left, two from Shanghai and two from Guangdong. When the bar was raised to 1.28 meters, the two women from Guangdong failed to clear it, while Zou and Wang both cleared it, competing for the top spot. Zou eventually won the championship. After the rankings were determined, Zou raised the bar again to try for a higher jump, but was unsuccessful. It was an unexpected success for Shanghai to win the first and second place in this event. Before the women's high jump, Ms. Zhang Huilan led the referees to inspect the field and check the high jump stands. The take-off area was 1.04 meters, with one side higher and one side lower. According to the women's high jump rules, the take-off area should be 914 meters. Attempts to find the person in charge of the venue were unsuccessful. The referees had to find carpenters to drill holes, which delayed the competition by more than 20 minutes. This must be attributed to the negligence of the venue management. At the roll call, 20 people were absent, with only 28 present. Overall, Guangdong's Liang Qianhua had the best posture, followed by Jiangsu's Hui Lanwei. None of the others were correct. Shandong's Zhu Dazhen, who had the highest hopes of winning, had gained weight and could no longer be as agile as a swallow, breaking the women's high jump record. When the high jump reached... meters...4, Ms. Zhu and the others were eliminated at the same time. Only four athletes cleared the bar, evenly split between Guangdong and Shanghai. As a result, Shanghai's Zou Shande won the high jump championship with a score of 1.208 meters, defeating the female athletes from thirty-two units. However, the results were slightly worse than in the past.</p>

<p>Shanghai Wins Over Fujian 7-0</p>
<p>Four Goals in the First Half, Three Goals in the Second Half</p>
<p>In the third soccer match, Shanghai defeated Fujian 7-0. It was held at 4:00 PM, with Chen Jixiang as the referee. It was Shanghai's first match, and due to their great reputation, many people came to watch. The Fujian team was mostly composed of young men under 20 years old, who were lively and brave, and their strength was quite strong. At the beginning of the match, the Fujian team was quite nervous. Within five minutes, Li Yichen scored the first goal. Three minutes later, Sun Jinying got the ball and passed it to Wan Xianghua, who kicked it accurately, and the ball flew in again. By the 15th minute, Li Yichen scored another goal. At this point, the Fujian team began to rally slightly, resisting desperately and fighting their way through. Fortunately, Zhou Xianyan's iron gate was as solid as a mountain, successfully saving dangerous shots. After a fierce battle for 20 minutes, Sun Jinshun scored another goal. The first half ended with Shanghai leading 4-0. In the second half, Shanghai's Chen Hongguang replaced Li Yichen, and Luo Haiguang replaced Chen Jiaqiu. After 25 minutes of intense fighting, Sun Jinshun opened the scoring. Chen Hongguang followed suit. Finally, Tu Kaiyuan scored a long-range shot. The second half ended with Shanghai winning 3-0. The overall score was 7-0, with Shanghai winning. The Fujian team had excellent spirit, and their skills were also commendable. It was unfortunate that they met a strong opponent in the first round.</p>

Guangdong showed its strength and its edge for the first time. Li Tiansheng and Ye Beihua showed off their skills. The strength of the two sides was vastly different. At the beginning of the match, within... minutes, Ye Beihua opened the scoring. The Anhui team was under heavy pressure, and their defense was completely breached. Within 15 minutes, they conceded half a dozen goals. Subsequently, the score increased. The Guangdong forwards used their heads and feet as they pleased. In the second half, the situation remained the same. The Anhui team showed an indomitable spirit and fought bravely. Goalkeeper Yang Jize also did his best. Although they conceded 18 goals, they were still honorable in defeat. Referee Wu Shouheng. ▲Guangdong Team</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th) In the second round of the soccer competition, Nanjing defeated Shanxi with a score of 5-1. The match was held at 2:00 PM, with Shen Huichun as the referee. In this match, both sides were very slow in their movements. The Nanjing team was slightly better in terms of coordination. The Shanxi team was strong and had hard kicks, but they were disorganized and lacked cooperation. After 20 minutes of intense fighting at the start of the match, there was no score. Soon after, Shanxi committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick, which led to the loss of one goal. Five minutes later, they conceded another goal. The first half ended with Nanjing leading 1-0. In the second half, the Nanjing team took advantage of their victory and continued to score three more goals. The Shanxi team tried to counterattack, but to no avail. It was not until the last ten minutes that Shanxi's right winger, Han Xueyi, finally scored a valuable goal. The second half ended with a score of 3-1. The overall result was 5-1, with Nanjing winning.</p>

<p>At 9:00 AM on the 11th, the women's softball match between Shanghai and Henan was held on the track and field. The Shanghai team was organized by Southeast and East Asia. After the Shanghai Municipal Games, they trained diligently, and their skills were quite remarkable. Their batting and fielding were both excellent. The Henan team was disorganized and made many mistakes in the field. As a result, Shanghai won the game by 27-2 in seven innings. The referees were Wu Bangwei and Hou Shexun, and the scorekeeper was Ma Xunbo.</p>
<p>▲Two Home Runs</p>
<p>In the second inning, Shanghai's Zeng Huiqiong hit a home run. In the top of the fourth inning, Pan Yueying also hit a home run. The ball landed and bounced quickly out of the center field. Also, in the second inning, Shanghai's first baseman, Li Baofan, caught a pop fly. Henan's Zhou Fanglu, who was originally on first base, tried to advance to second base. Li immediately threw the ball to the shortstop, Sun now at first base, who caught it, resulting in a double play. This was a highlight of the match.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai's Pitching and Hitting are Excellent</p>
<p>Shanghai's pitcher, Zou Shande, pitched well with excellent technique. In seven innings, she never gave up four balls. She only struck out three times. Henan's pitcher, Yuan Rui, is a famous track and field and softball thrower, but her pitching skills were poor. Her pitches were soft and slow, and the Shanghai team often scored four balls twice and struck out three times. Shanghai's batting skills were also impressive. The catcher, Pan Yueying, was also more stable and experienced than Henan's Chen Rui. ▲Overview of the Game</p>
<p>Shanghai batted first and started strongly, scoring eight runs in the first inning, with Sun, Li, Meng, Zeng, Pan, and Lu scoring. Henan was completely overwhelmed. In the second inning, Xiang Shaoliang's high ball was caught, and Meng occupied first base. Zeng Huiqiong hit a home run, scoring two points. Henan scored one point with Liu Lixue. In the third inning, Shanghai scored five more points, with Xu Chang and Sun Jieren running back. Henan made no progress due to Shanghai's fielding and passing. In the fourth inning, Shanghai scored eight more points, with Ren, Xu, Lu, Sun, Xiang, Sun, Zeng, and Pan scoring. Pan Yueying's home run contributed greatly to this inning, scoring two points in a row. Henan scored zero. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, Shanghai made slight adjustments to their lineup and only scored four points. Henan only scored one point in the fifth inning. In total, Shanghai won 27-2.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th dispatch) In the preliminary volleyball match, at 9 a.m., Shanghai faced Jiangxi at the third volleyball court. The Shanghai players were healthy and beautiful, attracting the attention of the audience at the Games. They lined up and practiced early in the morning, completing everything in one go.</p>
<p>When Jiangxi arrived, the referee blew the whistle to start the match. Shanghai got the serve, and the general Xiao Jieying served the ball, hitting the target with the first shot. From then on, the sound of the bell rang continuously. When Xiao Jieying stopped ringing the bell, Shanghai had already switched sides with a score of 11-0. After serving and "calling the telephone," Xiao Jieying scored 21 points with her individual serves. The Jiangxi team had already lost.</p>
<p>As Desired</p>
<p>In the second set, the two sides exchanged players. Jiangxi served but did not score. Shanghai's Wang Jinfeng "called the telephone" again, and the bell rang continuously. In the third set, Jiangxi took advantage of Shanghai's Lu Meiying's mistake to score one point. In the second half, Shanghai was instructed not to make things too difficult for the opponent, and the set ended with a score of 21-4. The Shanghai players left with smiles. Overall, Jiangxi, being a mixed team without training, was no match for Shanghai. However, they should know that strong opponents are ahead, so don't be complacent and be careful.</p>

The result of the first set was 20-15, with Zhejiang winning. In the second set, Zhejiang took advantage of their victory, attacking fiercely. They created a situation of 11-4, but Hebei, determined to avenge their loss, found a way to prevent the long-used techniques of the eldest son.

<p>丨Sichuan Wins Over Hong Kong - Hong Kong Forfeits</p>
<p>Men's Basketball: Hubei Wins Over Jiangxi. Two men's basketball matches were originally scheduled for the morning of the 11th. Sichuan won because Hong Kong did not send a team to participate and forfeited. In reality, only the match between Hubei and Jiangxi was played. The interest on both sides was flat. Hubei's teamwork was skilled and their shooting accurate. Jiangxi had difficulty attacking and defending, making them pale in comparison. The score at halftime was 23-7, and the final result was 60-15. Hubei's left forward Wang Yide and center Deng Zhiming had skillful techniques and deep knowledge. Jiangxi committed numerous fouls, with the number of fouls exceeding their score.</p>

<p>There was a men's basketball game in the afternoon between Jiangsu and Suiyuan. The actions of both sides were slow and unremarkable. It is not easy for Suiyuan, located on the edge of the country, to achieve such results. It was a mistake for Jiangsu not to have famous players Qian Ding and Yang Tong as representatives. The entire team was like a pile of sand, with no teamwork.</p>
<p>Suiyuan's continued struggle is commendable. In the first half, Jiangsu's Jin Youde scored first, and Suiyuan's Tang Guozhi made a shot. Afterwards, Jiangsu used long throws to break through the enemy camp repeatedly. Suiyuan closely followed, trailing by only four or five points. As the first half was about to end, Suiyuan's teamwork suddenly became skilled, scoring many points. The result of the first half was 26-23, with Jiangsu winning by only three points. In the second half, Suiyuan performed even better. When She Junxiang was sent off for four fouls, Suiyuan suffered a setback, and the score gradually widened. However, at the beginning, they still fought like beasts, making several long throws. Jiangsu seized the opportunity to attack, accumulating points and finally defeating Suiyuan 58-38. Although Jiangsu won, it was not much to be proud of.</p>

<p>In the second match, Nanjing faced Hubei. At the beginning, there was no difference in strength, with scores of 2-2 and 4-4, and several ties. Hubei took the lead, and Nanjing followed closely.

Hubei's Huang Kunyu and Fan Yaxiong broke through the enemy's defenses, and their momentum increased. Hubei led 12-7 at halftime. In the second half, Hubei's forwards were particularly active, and Nanjing also had some brilliant moments. Wu Huajin and Zhang Dewei also made contributions. However, Hubei's Huang Kunyu and Sun Shuyi were both brave and extraordinary, and Nanjing could not overcome Hubei. The score was 22-13 at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Hubei's Zha Kewei and Jie Shuxian were successively penalized and sent off, and Hubei suddenly lost its color.

<p>In the third match, Beiping faced Anhui. The Beiping team, with Sun Guiyun as its mainstay, won quite easily. Sun Guiyun is a famous sprinter, and her attack is exceptionally fast. Her dribbling is also quite skillful, and her coordination is also very commendable. However, her shooting is not very accurate. In the first half, Beiping scored first, and Anhui also retaliated. After 2-2, Beiping's momentum was like a broken bamboo, and everything went smoothly. In the first quarter, Beiping took a 13-2 lead. In the second quarter, Beiping was even more successful, and Sun Guiyun scored repeatedly. Although Anhui took many timeouts to try to counterattack, it was ultimately ineffective. Beiping's Sui Changshan was very active. At halftime, Beiping led 28-5. In the second half, although Sun Guiyun did not play, Anhui still showed no improvement, committing frequent fouls. Beiping's score increased sharply, ending the third quarter at 45-8. In the fourth quarter, Sun Guiyun returned to the field, and her momentum greatly increased. Anhui was helpless, unable to advance or retreat. The Beiping team was like a raging fire, winning the fourth quarter 26-0. In conclusion, Beiping won 71-8. The referee was Shu.</p>

<p>▲Ma Shaobo Forces Strong Opponents</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, the Jing team started the competition. At the beginning of the competition, Ma Shaobo, the first singles player from the Jing team, showed great talent, rendering the Yu team's Li Fa helpless, winning the first set with a score of six to two. At the beginning of the second set, Ma became more active, splitting, killing, and pressing as he pleased. The shots were also good, completing six games in one go, winning the second set. From the third set onwards, due to the importance of winning or losing, Yu Li Zongfa struggled to resist. After two-two and three-three, Li took the lead with four to three. Unfortunately, he lost the next game, making it four to four. In the ninth and tenth games, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and each won a game, making it five to five. Afterwards, Ma Shaobo won two consecutive games, ending with seven to five. In total, Jing Ma Shaobo won with three straight sets.</p>

<p>Mr. Lin is one of our country's top tennis players, and his superb tennis skills have long been well-known. This time, he represented Sichuan to attend the National Games and compete with athletes from all over the country, giving the people of the capital a great feast for the eyes. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, the first singles match between Sichuan and Suiyuan started. Sichuan's Lin Baohua faced Suiyuan's Guo Quanzhen. The strength of the two sides was very different, forming a one-sided situation. Lin Baohua's shots were powerful, feinting to the east and attacking the west, sometimes forward and sometimes backward. The landing point and direction of the ball made it impossible for the opponent to figure out. As a result, the situation was uneventful, and it ended in just thirty minutes. In the end, Lin won with three straight sets, with scores of six to one, six to zero, and six to one.</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin Accomplishes Greatly</p>
<p>In the afternoon doubles, Suiyuan forfeited to Sichuan. Sichuan's second singles player Qian Yaobin defeated Suiyuan's Zhang Yuehua, three six-to-one. Sichuan Province attended the National Games, and its tennis skills achieved considerable results. Zhang Yuehua's technology was mediocre. Compared with Qian, they were like heaven and earth. As a result of the three games, Qian was able to win with a "blank score" because he didn't want to embarrass the opponent too much, so he gave one game in each set. The scores of the three sets were all six to one, with Qian winning.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Criticism of the Central Sports Field Building <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yunrui</p>
<p>Before I start writing, the first thing I want to declare is that I do not know the designer and have no prejudice against him. However, for the sake of academic research, I must criticize him. If there are any inappropriate points, please forgive the architect. This field is too far from the city. Now, everyone who comes to visit the field criticizes it. In fact, when the author designed and built it three years ago, he published opinions against it in the newspaper. Those who paid attention to it should still remember it. At that time, the September 18th Incident had not yet occurred, and the national situation was better. The government had a plan to build government office buildings next to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Building south of the mausoleum was indeed a far-reaching plan. Unexpectedly, the war between the government and the warlords greatly damaged the country's vitality. Due to the September 18th Incident, the government's plan to build next to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum could not be realized. As a result, a great sports field had to be isolated in front of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. This was caused by the situation, not the responsibility of the government authorities, nor the responsibility of the architect. Now that the die is cast, there is no need to blame too much for the inconvenience of being too far from the city. During the preparation period for this National Games, the author, as the deputy director-general, also served as the head of the venue equipment section, and went to the field to inspect and supervise the work for more than a month. Therefore, regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the field and the experience gained from studying sports buildings and equipment over the years, there are many things that I cannot help but say. I will discuss them in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Track and Field <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>1. The Area Occupied by the Stands is Too Large</p>
<p>The purpose of the stands is to enable visitors to see various sports clearly. If you sit on the stands and cannot see the various sports clearly, then the stands are useless. If the running track is more than 600 meters, then people on the stands cannot see various sports clearly. Therefore, some people advocate building an 800-meter running track, but they do not understand this. The running track of the Central Sports Field is 500 meters, which is already not small (usually 400 meters). Even if the stands are built close to the running track, it is still not possible to see all the items in the field clearly. Now, four basketball (or volleyball courts) are set up outside the ends of the curved sections of the running track. As a result, the people sitting on the stands in the two curved sections cannot see the track and field events clearly. The stands in the two curved sections are the same as being empty for track and field events, which is too uneconomical. Moreover, basketball courts and volleyball courts have their own specialized buildings outside the track and field. Of the eight courts in the curved section of the stands, only one was used this time. The other eight courts are the same as being empty. Most of the cost of building a track and field goes to the stands. Now, because useless ball courts are built inside the stands, a large amount of money is spent on useless stands, wasting national funds. It is a pity that the architect had already left the capital to go to Shenyang when this field was built. Otherwise, when the plan was first set, I would have criticized it greatly in the newspaper and hoped to save the country's expenses.</p>
<p>2. The Running Track is Too Wide, Whether Straight or Curved. According to Dr. Diem, a German expert in sports architecture, the straight section of the running track should be 7.2 meters (six lanes, 1.2 meters per lane). Because the results of the 100-meter and 200-meter races are improving every day, the difference between first and second, and second and third, may be within one or two centimeters in the future. If too many people run together, it will be very difficult for the finish line referee. The northern ends of the straight and curved sections of the Central Sports Field are all 15 meters. This width can accommodate 12 people running together. The designer probably thought that this wide track could allow 12 people to run in the 100-meter, 200-meter, 400-meter, and 400-meter hurdles, saving the number of preliminary and semi-final runs. I don't know that saving the number of preliminary and semi-final runs is one thing, and judging is another thing. Taking the 400-meter hurdles as an example, one inspector probably watches one or two rows. If there are twelve hurdles in one row, then the twelve jumpers will come one after another. It is not easy to see who fouls. The hurdles in the curved section are uneven, and the more hurdles there are, the wider the field of vision, and the more difficult it is to see who fouls. Moreover, according to the latest rules, if a foot or leg slightly hits a hurdle and it shakes, it is considered a knockdown. The judge must be even more astute. If there are twelve people running together, it will be difficult for the inspector to see clearly. Therefore, a 15-meter running track is inevitably too wide. Because the running track is wide, the scope of the stands cannot be small, and the construction costs money again. Therefore, from the perspective of the running track, it also makes the construction uneconomical.</p>
<p>3. All the Jumping Tracks and Running Tracks in the Entire Field are Lower Than the Ground on Both Sides, Which is a Major Mistake in Construction. The most important things in a track and field are the running track and the jumping track, and the most important thing to pay attention to in construction is the drainage problem on the track. Because the water on the running track and the jumping track can quickly drain away after the rain, the weather can clear and the movement can continue. Now, the jumping tracks and running tracks in the Central Sports Field are all lower than the ground on both sides. As a result, all the water gathers on the jumping track and the running track when it rains, which is a big mistake. Now, the mouths of the drainage holes are all lower than the running track. I don't know what the designer's intention is. I cannot understand it.</p>
<p>4. The Location of the Track and Field Items in the Field is Not Legal.</p>
<p>According to the legal configuration, the iron ring for the discus throw in the field competition is placed in the center of the curved section of the running track. Because the direction of the discus throw can be fired in all directions within 180 degrees, even experienced veterans will occasionally release the discus and shoot horizontally. If the discus circle is not placed in the center but is placed on the side of the curved section, there is a danger of the discus throwing into the kneeling track. Now, a high jump area is set up in the center of the southern curved section, occupying the position of the discus, and the discus has to be set on the side close to the running track, which is full of dangers and can be expected. On the one hand, the distance of the run-up during the high jump is not large, and the fan-shaped jumping track can be placed on both sides of the curved section. Now, it is placed in the center, hindering the position of the discus, which can be said to be no planning at all.</p>
<p>5. The Sand Pit is Too Deep and Too Short, and the Jumping Track for the Triple Jump is Too Short. The Sand Surface in the Sand Pit is Uneven with the Take-Off Board.</p>
<p>The sand pit should not be too deep. If it is too deep, the jumper will flow down too much when he falls into the pit, and the loss of performance will be great. Therefore, the depth of the sand pit should be from two feet to two and a half feet. If the long jump pit is too short, the jumpers will be wary, which will reduce the performance. The triple jump track is more than 45 meters from the sand pit. Now, all that is available in this field is about 35 meters. Subtracting the distance of more than 11 meters between the take-off board and the sand pit, there are only about 25 meters left. Within this distance, it is impossible to make the jumping runner increase the speed to the maximum extent. Therefore, before the meeting, the jumping track was lengthened by 10 meters. The original sand surface in the sand pit was lower than the jumping track by more than four or five inches, which is related to the performance. The lower the sand surface in the sand pit, the higher the performance jumped than it should be. The more the sand surface is higher than the jumping track, the lower the performance jumped than it should be. If the sand surface is too high or too low, it is enough to make the performance inaccurate. The wooden edges around the sand pit this time were originally too low, and they were all raised by four or five inches to make the sand surface also rise by four or five inches.</p>
<p>In addition to the above shortcomings, there are others, such as the baseball field being too small, the football field having no way out, and there being no gap between the stands and the field. Due to the limitation of space, I cannot evaluate them in detail. I hope that the designing gentlemen will refer to Chinese and foreign sports architecture books more in the future, so that the same mistakes will not be discovered in other fields.</p>

<p>On the first day of the opening, due to the large number of people, the order was greatly disrupted, and the iron railings on the commander's platform were squeezed and broken, and one person was injured. Therefore, on the morning of the second day, when the race began, there was a continuous broadcast, asking the audience in the front row on the platform not to lean on the iron railings to avoid danger. The restaurants were filled with the sounds of singing and laughter.</p>
<p>Nineteen of the temporary markets were Chinese and Western restaurants, and the seats were full of guests, which was extremely prosperous. On the first day, there was almost no room to insert a foot in the restaurants, and only on the second day could one dine at ease. The owners also employed many female waitresses, with attracting female guests as their main task. The female athletes sang and laughed, echoing the calls of the female waitresses, while the men bowed their heads to eat, silently unable to express anything.</p>

<p>On the second day, the Guangdong and Anhui football teams clashed, and the disparity in strength between the two sides was huge, forming a one-sided situation. The score in the first half was nine to zero. During the break, a gentleman from Anhui went to the Guangdong team's camp and said, "Please be a little more lenient and don't push people too hard." However, in the second half, they still played fiercely, which was impossible to stop.</p>

<p>On the first day of the National Games opening, due to the National Day holiday and free admission, Zijin Mountain was bustling with activity. The grand occasion was witnessed by the capital. The details of the event are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Opening of the Games Emptied the Streets <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Games opened at 10 a.m. on Double Ten Day, stirring up the capital and emptying the streets. From the city center to the venue, about twenty miles, cars, rickshaws, and pedestrians were connected end to end, winding like a belt. The city was crowded with people, and outside the city, there were mountains of people. The enthusiastic atmosphere was unprecedented. It rained suddenly for about two hours in the morning, but fortunately, it stopped immediately. Cannons were fired to clear the way, and airplanes soared in the sky, which was magnificent and enthusiastic, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. The only regret was the lack of thoroughness in handling affairs and the abandonment of order.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Millions of People Looked Up to the Chairman's Demeanor <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Lin of the National Government was the honorary chairman of the Games. Therefore, after delivering his address, he sat on the eastern commander's platform to watch the elementary school students perform Tai Chi exercises. When the elementary school students entered the venue, the stands on the right of the rostrum, because they were on a dirt slope, a portion of the audience jumped into the venue from above. For a time, many people followed suit, gathering in front of the rostrum to look up to the chairman's demeanor. Because there were too few Boy Scouts, they could not maintain order. For a time, the order was greatly disrupted, and the Tai Chi exercises could not be performed. Later, soldiers assisted, but they could not completely disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>During the Tai Chi exercise performance, because the audience surrounded the elementary school students, they could not perform around. Mr. Chu Minyi had already taken off his long gown and changed into a short robe. He grabbed a flag from a certain school and waved it around. The flag flew up and down, and the audience, frightened by him, cleared a space, and the Tai Chi exercises began to be performed. It is hoped that the authorities of the Games will quickly seek relief today.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the sports began, and each venue was free to enter and watch, so people were very enthusiastic. The short-distance running results were outstanding, and in the track and field high jump final, a Shanghai athlete unexpectedly set a national record of 1.8 meters, which was a pleasant surprise. Lu Ming, a veteran, won the championship in the shot put with 12.19 meters. Chen Saiqiu of Shanghai finished second. In the women's long jump, Qian Hangsu of Shanghai unexpectedly lost and only got second place. Li Yuanfen of Guangdong won the championship with 4.795 meters. Men's tennis and women's volleyball were like sentries fighting, and the situation was calm. The men's basketball team of Shandong made a surprising debut and performed outstandingly, attracting the attention of the Hebei and Shanghai teams, and was regarded as a strong opponent. There were many track and field finals on the 14th. Under the fierce competition, the emergence of new national records can be expected. The order of ball games is extremely important, and the competitive situation will gradually intensify.</p>

<p>A tragedy occurred in the 200-meter race. Yesterday, the audience was unusually lively. The right side of the western commander's platform was the finish line for the track and field events, so there were even more spectators. At 2:30 p.m., during the women's 200-meter preliminary, the audience was scrambling to be the first to see the finish line. The railings of the stands could not withstand the pressure of so many people, and the general audience did not pay attention to the situation. Unfortunately, the iron railings suddenly broke, and the audience in front of the railings rolled down like dumplings out of a pot, piling up on top of each other. The two people who fell first were crushed at the bottom, their heads injured and broken, and brain matter flowed out. The Boy Scouts on the scene immediately rushed to provide first aid, bandaged the wounds, and sent them to the Central Hospital for treatment. Generally, there was no danger to their lives.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Athletes' Clothes Were of Various Colors <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>When all the athletes circled the venue, the clothes of the Sichuan and Jiangsu female athletes were the most outstanding. The Sichuan female athletes wore red and white pants, while the Jiangsu female athletes wore yellow shirts and white pants. Both were brightly colored and charming. The Guangdong football team practiced heading the ball in the field after the meeting. Each ball was passed back and forth on the heads of the athletes more than ten times. The superb ball skills won a lot of applause from the audience.</p>

<p>The tall Shao Jun was suddenly surrounded by many Guangdong athletes while watching elementary school students in Beijing perform Tai Chi exercises. They crowded him into the basketball court to take a group photo as a souvenir and asked him to try to shoot a basket. Shao Jun reached out and could touch the basket, and all the athletes burst into laughter.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the news media from inside and outside Beijing were originally assigned a reporter's seat by the Games Organizing Committee to facilitate interviews by various newspapers. However, the seat was located next to the western commander's platform, while the opening ceremony of the Games was held on the eastern platform. Although there was a loudspeaker to broadcast, it was too far away to hear clearly. Moreover, yesterday the audience was unusually enthusiastic and occupied the seat. The general news reporters were not allowed to enter the venue for interviews according to the rules, and there was no place to stand on the stands. There was no one in the reception room, and they were blocked by Boy Scouts on the commander's platform, wandering on the side of the road, at a loss. The most strange thing was that the honorary directors of the newspaper offices were all over the seats on the commander's platform, openly copying records there. Therefore, the Minsheng Daily, Shen Bao, Shishi News Agency, and others jointly questioned President Wang Shijie, expressing their dissatisfaction. Wang expressed regret that there were too many spectators and the order was not good. He promised to investigate the unfair treatment of the news media and convened a joint meeting last night to resolve the issue and discuss a unified approach to provide relief. The publicity team also issued relief measures, planning to issue entrance and exit passes for each venue to each newspaper office.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zhang Jingren, who lived at No. 14 Huaihai Road, took his son Zhang Rongquan to watch the opening ceremony. Due to the crowded streets, they were separated. Zhang Rongquan is a student at Xuanfu Lower Street Elementary School, wearing a gray Ziqiang woolen uniform and yellow short sneakers. The Games Organizing Committee announced that anyone who finds the child can send him to Huaihai Road.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Athletes' Physique Changes and Physical Strength Improvement <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Sports can improve health, promote the development of internal organs, and create a good physique. A healthy person with an excellent physique does not necessarily have sufficient physical strength to win in sports competitions. The physique we need is a typical healthy physique, not a strongman's physique. Therefore, the win-loss rate in sports competitions cannot be used to judge whether a person's physique is healthy. In theory, physical strength and health are two different issues. Health needs exercise to improve it, and muscles and the heart become stronger, and physical strength gradually increases. However, to improve health through exercise, it must be done through long-term training. An athlete's physical strength can improve significantly after several weeks or months of training. This is not due to the development of muscles and internal organs, but a representation of the improvement in sports records. After a long period of training, the athlete's original physique will transform into an altered physique. Due to the change in physique, physical strength is abnormally increased. In the 1913 All-European Rowing Competition held in Germany, the pulse of the winning German athlete Graf was only 54 beats per minute after the race, while other athletes exceeded 100 beats per minute. After fierce competition, his pulse was even lower than that of a normal person at rest. This proves the change in his physique. Athletes with altered physiques can often produce excellent physical strength.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Special Heart Images of Athletes at the Finish Line of the 50-meter Preliminary Are a Sign of Physical Alteration <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>An athlete's heart is generally too large in diameter. This can be clearly demonstrated during diagnosis. A heart that is not large in diameter must be too small, but it is less common than a normal heart. A heart that is too large in diameter is called an "athlete's heart." The so-called "athlete's heart" has been studied by medical experts around the world for 30 years. Regarding the results of the research, there are various different reports. According to the opinions of most researchers, people with "athlete's heart" have better physical strength than normal people. This "athlete's heart" hypertrophy is different from other pathological heart hypertrophy. According to the research of Dr. Bergseiva of Germany, bicycle athletes account for the largest number of athletes with hypertrophic hearts in Germany, followed by sledding, marathon running, swimming, and fighting athletes. According to the research of Dr. Goff of Austria, the hearts of rowing, cycling, and sledding athletes are the largest, the hearts of swimming, mountaineering, and weightlifting athletes are average, and the hearts of football and fencing athletes are the smallest. Moreover, the shapes are also very different from normal people. The size of athletes' hearts varies depending on the sport. For example, the heart contours of fencing athletes are divided into teardrop-shaped hearts, spherical hearts, relaxed hearts, acute-angled hearts, and pointed hearts. The changes in an athlete's heart vary with the number of days of training. The hearts of those with minor changes can return to their original state in a short period of time after stopping exercise. Once they stop exercising, their health will gradually decline, but their physical strength will increase compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Athletes' Low Blood Pressure, Slow Breathing, and Urine Abnormalities <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Athletes' blood pressure is mostly low. This is closely related to the "athlete's heart" mentioned in the previous section. However, some ordinary athletes sometimes have higher blood pressure than normal people. Low blood pressure is a sign of physically excellent athletes. In these athletes, the pulse gradually decreases during exercise, and the heart's strength also decreases. Therefore, athletes breathe less often at rest than normal people. Normal people breathe 13 to 20 times per minute. Anything less than that is called "slow breathing." Breathing is linked to the pulse. When the pulse is slow, breathing is also slow. With fewer breaths, they can achieve better results during exercise. The breathing rate of an athlete with slow breathing does not increase more than that of a normal person during exercise. In summary, the signs of low blood pressure and slow breathing are proof of physical alteration. Athletes exhibit these effects when their physical strength improves.</p>
<p>After excessive exercise, urine abnormalities are a well-known fact. This is due to acute nephritis. The physical alteration of trained athletes has been described above, so the condition of their blood also changes, making it easier to mimic the function of the kidneys. After strenuous exercise, they will find abnormalities in their urine composition, especially in trained athletes. This is also a sign of physical alteration.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Functional Changes in the Nervous System Are Divided into Physiological and Pathological <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The number of heartbeats (i.e., pulse) and contraction force and tension are often controlled and regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. In other words, the parasympathetic nerve has an inhibitory effect on heartbeats, while the sympathetic nerve has a promoting effect on the heart. If the function of the parasympathetic nerve is superior to the function of the sympathetic nerve, the number of heartbeats will decrease. The slowness of an athlete's pulse is due to the oversensitivity of the parasympathetic nerve, which praises the relaxation of their heart muscle. With a relaxed heart, the volume also expands. The cause of the "athlete's heart" is the lack of tension in the heart muscle and the return to the oversensitivity of the parasympathetic nerve. The low blood pressure of athletes is also caused by the oversensitivity of the parasympathetic nerve. An adult with a pulse rate of more than 80 beats per minute is considered to have a fast pulse. Athletes also use this standard for a fast pulse. However, among 70 martial artists, there are at most only three with fast pulses. The neurological alteration can also be demonstrated by abnormal reflexes and facial nerves. Exercise training can not only cause changes in the parasympathetic nerve, but also alter all nervous systems. However, the parasympathetic nerve is the main sign of proving physical alteration. From this point of view, if the changes in the nervous system function of an athlete can adapt to a certain sport and are similar to the standards of normal people, then the changes are physiological phenomena. If the changes reach the highest degree and physical strength declines as a result, then it is completely a pathological convulsion. Therefore, when discussing the changes in the nervous system function of athletes, it is important to pay attention to the two types of distinctions: physiological and pathological.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Disease Due to Overwork and Mild to Severe Physical Alteration <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>If exercise training is too intense, it is easy to get sick due to physical alteration, which hinders the health of the body. This is the so-called overtraining. There are many people who have lost their lives due to illness. However, the reversal of the healthy state of athletes is not accidental. In the middle of exercise training, the physique gradually turns in the direction of alteration. People blindly believe that exercise can improve health, but they do not know that athletes who get sick or even die from exercise are endless. This lovely phenomenon must be explained once. Sports exercise is not as great as we idealize it to be in improving health. It can only change the physique. Depending on the appropriate training method, athletic ability will improve accordingly. The extent to which exercise training should alter the physique is also a matter for discussion. If exercise training is too intense, it can change the athlete's innate physique, the quality of the nervous system, and the heart's congenital adaptability (hereditary endocrine function). When athletes reach their highest records, they must undergo intense training, so their physical alteration has almost reached its extreme. During overtraining, the body is prone to fatigue, which can easily lead to diseases and a lot of danger. In summary, when the body is mildly altered, athletic ability can also reach an excellent point. On the other hand, severe alteration can easily lead to disease. Therefore, athletes must use diagnosis to distinguish the degree of physical alteration and take strict precautions regarding the measurement of exercise training.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Athletes Who Do Not Feel Fatigue Have Blood and Acidic Products Harmonized <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>During exercise, the body's metabolism is very vigorous. The waste products such as carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and phosphoric acid produced by the body are more than usual (at rest). Under normal circumstances, these acidic products are mixed with proteins, bicarbonates, and phosphates in the blood. The body's chemistry and reactivity can constantly maintain the body's health and maintain a state of equilibrium. However, during exercise, the amount of these acidic products increases sharply, and the blood gradually loses its ability to mix with them. This is a major cause of physical fatigue. Especially when a large amount of lactic acid is produced, the ability of carbon dioxide to harmonize with the blood decreases significantly. This is because the blood's reserve capacity is weak. However, people who have undergone considerable physical training have the possibility of gradually increasing the carbon dioxide in their blood. Athletes who have undergone considerable training have more blood production during exercise than normal people, which is sufficient to harmonize with acidic products. Therefore, trained athletes do not feel fatigued even after prolonged exercise. This state of blood change is entirely due to regular exercise training. It is naturally easier for these athletes to improve their performance. However, the special blood changes in athletes are more closely related to their physical alteration. Overtraining easily leads to disorders of the nervous system and hypersensitivity of the parasympathetic nerve.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Random Talk on Architecture by Lin Huiyin <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Chinese people are the most progressive people and the people who are most likely to achieve complete success in everything. For example, taking architecture as an example, it has not been long since it transitioned from the old method to the new method, but it has easily reached its highest point and has already made people feel tired of it.</p>
<p>Since you are tired of it, you cannot seek some new stimulation. You feel that the old architecture is really good, it looks pleasing to the eye, and it is leisurely to live in, but you cannot say it out loud, because you are afraid that people will say that you are going backwards. So you say in a roundabout way... the old architecture should indeed be abolished. But the glazed tiles are worth preserving. In fact, you know that there are many reinforced concrete buildings that use glazed tiles, but no one has ever advocated that... you advocated that, so that people can see the combination of the two new materials, and they will think of it as being achieved by your suggestion. And in your heart, you will still have a sincere hope, hoping that the reinforced concrete and cement under the glazed tiles will still be replaced with earth bricks and lime.</p>
<p>Or you think that the reason why new architecture needs to be built meticulously and delicately is only to demonstrate to the old architecture, which means that the new architecture can also do what the old architecture can do, because the old architecture is very meticulous and very delicate. But you feel that the demonstration period has passed, and you believe that the new architecture is already meticulous enough and delicate enough, and should no longer continue to be so meticulous and delicate. And what is needed now should be knives and guns. The whole city is brutal. There are bombs everywhere. As long as you touch it slightly, you will be in danger of being bombed to death. Otherwise, the meticulous and delicate architecture will be dangerous. Because it will be麻醉性的. You will be麻醉性d to death without even knowing it. When you see all this, you can't bear it anymore and issue a warning to change the new architecture to a new direction.</p>
<p>Chinese people are the most progressive people, and it can be foreseen that a newer architecture will be completed soon.</p>
<h3 id="e222">National Sickness by Gao Zhi <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Since I have been sick in bed, and I have been getting headaches from Chinese doctors and Chinese medicine every day, I have been thinking wildly in silence, and I seem to have realized something. People's bodies can get sick, and countries can also get sick. China has been called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and there is no doubt that it is sick. If a country is sick, then the disease should be called national sickness.</p>
<p>What exactly is China's national sickness? I will not make a conclusion here, but just say my personal opinion. Some say that the national sickness is laziness, or that the national sickness is the aging of the nation, but these seem too abstract. China is founded on agriculture, and officials are truly lazy, but the farmers are considered to be the most diligent. From a biological point of view, the nation will not age.</p>
<p>According to those who are engaged in the civil education movement in Dingxian, the four major diseases of the Chinese people (that is, China) are ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness. This means that more than 80% of the national population is illiterate, some are so poor that they do not even have food to eat, and they are not strong, do not know hygiene, and there is no civic training at all. Everyone only knows selfishness and does not know public interest.</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution, there have been twenty-two years. Regarding "ignorance," isn't there a Ministry of Education there to educate the people? Regarding "weakness," the Ministry of Health (Department) has been established for many years, and the country is promoting it very enthusiastically. Soon everyone will be strong, not addicted to opium, and can also practice meditation to temper their spirits and pray for the country to eliminate disasters. As for poverty, hasn't the government issued hundreds of millions of internal and external debts? It is doing construction projects, and the cotton and wheat loans are coming again, and what treasury bonds are going to be issued, and there are also aviation lottery tickets, giving everyone the opportunity to win 500,000 yuan. The government only takes half of the total income. But have these monies cured the four diseases?</p>
<p>This again involves the issue of "selfishness." The selfishness of the general public for food and clothing does not count as a disease. The selfishness of those who are "public servants" of the general public is the real disease. The strength or weakness of the national system certainly depends on the level of the people's power, but the leadership and responsibility of the leaders are the prerequisites for prosperity and decline. What was Japan like before the Meiji Restoration? What were Italy and Germany like before the 1860s? What has the Soviet Union become in fifteen years? What was it like before? A leader who blames all the bad things on the people is incompetent and shameful. However, the leaders have power, and with power they can act selfishly. If a high official or a big warlord acts selfishly, hundreds of thousands or millions of people will die of poverty and starvation. Public debts, internal debts, treasury bonds, etc. are increasing, the people are suffering more and more, and the national sickness is becoming more and more difficult to improve. Maybe this is the national sickness?</p>
<p>When people are sick, there are still Chinese medicine and medicine to deal with them. When the country is sick, what should be done?</p>
<h3 id="e223">Sequel to Rectifying Books by Tang Tao <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, a thought flew into my mind, "Rectifying Books!"</p>
<p>But it is really difficult. Inside these books, there are His Majesty the Emperor, revolutionary martyrs, and poets, all of whom are present. Rectifying them is a very troublesome thing. If I cite the ceremonial system of the previous dynasty, it would have been treason a few years ago, and now it is a traitor to the Japanese, a double crime, not to be trifled with! But if I do not wear a hat or shoes, or put on the mask of a gentleman or an old fox, and do it casually, the poet will say... (This is just a supporting role!)</p>
<p>In the past, I also followed the second elder, entered and exited the gate of sages, and traveled around the land of poetry and propriety, listening to them praise the Six Classics and advocate the Eight Virtues, holding the late emperor as high as the sky, and I was very unhappy in my heart! Later, I was moved by Lao Tzu and Zhuang Zhou, and felt that everything would be empty in the end. I wanted to ride a green ox out of the Hangu Pass.</p>
<p>But in the end, I did not succeed.</p>
<p>This is a good thing for people who love good articles. Because if I really became an immortal, the gentlemen would have lost an object to slander, and famous articles would have been buried, wouldn't that be a pity!</p>
<p>From then on, I decided not to read the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, and put them in the fold of the bookshelf.</p>
<p>But the essays and short stories of the Jin Dynasty are what I have loved all my life... The reason is that when I read them aloud, I always feel fresh and delightful. I would never feel like the modern popular "Road Pilgrimage" or "XX Symphony," that I have to take aspirin while reading!</p>
<p>The old shopkeeper of the pharmacy is so energetic because the fake and shoddy goods are so great.</p>
<p>Next to the essays of the Jin Dynasty, I put the Yuan opera.</p>
<p>Next are more than a dozen complete collections. Inside there is "XX Prose," which is said to be the legacy of a sage. A half-life monkey, a hundred-year-old crown dog, alas!</p>
<p>I put the new and old poems and lyrics together. The new ones have not been tried, and the old ones? This tune has not been played for a long time. Anyway, in ancient times there were talented scholars and beautiful women, and now there are young masters. They will make friends themselves, so I will not say more.</p>
<p>There are the most novels in each book, especially the foreign texts that crawl like crabs. I will rectify them one by one. Originally, I wanted to say a few words, but it is said that the best articles are written concisely, and it is especially strictly forbidden to touch other people's sore spots.</p>
<p>Let's stop here. And I wish that the world will have the same writing system and not suffer from hysterical diseases!</p>
<h3 id="e224">Ganpu Correspondence (3) by A Ying <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Brother ○○:</p>
<p>Due to special reasons, I returned to Shanghai on the 18th and came to Ganpu for the second time on the 20th. The matter has not been completely settled, and it is still impossible to go to the salt folk immediately. Feeling bored, the elegance of the literati arose, and we gathered a few people to go hiking. At this time, I also became a literati, which is really like the advertisement for Bai Lingji, a bit unexpected. However, I did become a literati. I will report this day's elegance to you as a digression in "Ganpu Correspondence."</p>
<p>This time, there were five people in total, including me. We set off from Wancang Mountain, where we lived, at 10:30 a.m., passed Dahu Mountain, where there were many pine trees. There was a stone bridge and a stream at the foot of the mountain. The rice had turned yellow and the fragrance was intoxicating. We walked west along the stream to the tomb of Zhu Rui, the governor of Zhejiang in the early Republic of China. The beard of one of the stone figures had the flavor of a Ren Dan beard. From this, it can be seen that living people like to be linked to Japan, and even the dead are proud to be associated with Japan, which is very sad. Behind the tomb is Zhu An, built over the stream. The stream flows horizontally in front of the main hall. It must be very majestic after heavy rain, but unfortunately it is now dry, as if the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted. There is a bridge over the stream that leads directly to the main hall. I am not a Buddhist disciple, so I do not know who is enshrined there. We sat by the cave to drink tea and looked at the grape trellis built by the stream and the ivy along the house, red flowers. A poetic inspiration was a bit eruptive, but when I thought of the grapes planted by my father in my hometown seven years ago, and the sad mood when Mr. Zhu Fu wrote "Ivy Walk," my poetic mood was sent down to the eighteenth level of hell. However, let us have Xu Zhimo continue to monopolize the patent.</p>
<p>At 11:10, we left Zhu An and went up Daqi Mountain along the stream. We climbed about 400 steps on stone steps to Xu Zhonglie's tomb, which was not yet finished. I closed my eyes and meditated, thinking that it would be a great sight to see the mountain torrents surging and the water splashing here after heavy rain. I deeply cursed the old sky for not having a torrential rain yesterday. Looking at the spirit tablet, I learned that this Xu Zhonglie (named Yongyi, styled Jifu, and nicknamed Xiaoyun, from Haiyan) was an anti-imperialist in the Gengzi year, and he was killed for being anti-imperialist. I thought that the establishment of this tomb was much more meaningful than Zhu's tomb. No wonder there was no Ren Dan beard or the upturned beard often seen in movies on the mouth of the stone figure in front of his tomb. We stood in awe and looked at it for a long time. Afterwards, we passed through Shanzhen Village, crossed Lu Jialing, and arrived at the bamboo forest at the foot of the ridge. The sun had already made my head hurt, but suddenly I found a bamboo forest with ten thousand poles. Walking inside, it was really cool and comfortable, and there was the sound of Xiao Xiao's music. Going up, it is Tanxian Ridge. It is said that the stone road along the way was built by Tanxian overnight, and there are gold nuggets under the stones. Dreaming of getting rich is already ridiculous. It is even more peculiar to know that there is gold but not to dig it, but just talk about it. Fortunately, heaven and earth know that I do not want to get rich, so I will not criticize his mother. There is also a stream along the mountain, and there is a protruding round concave in the stream. It is said that this is the place where Tanxian bathed. Even if the water is cut off above and below, this place will never be exhausted, and the water can cure sores, which people can testify. It is natural that there is sulfur in the water that can cure sores. It is indeed a strange coincidence that it will never be exhausted all year round. Therefore, after this day's trip was over, I made an appointment with two friends to run to take a bath. This bath was indeed more pleasant than the hot springs in Shanghai. The regret is that the water that never runs dry in this natural bathtub was emptied by the efforts of our three people in less than ten minutes... The two friends were still not reconciled and used towels to wipe up even the remaining drops. If Tanxian knew, I think he would definitely shout unlucky! The relics of the immortals also have the opportunity to be stripped bare. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel happy! But my correspondence had to end in the middle of this "happiness." Brother ○○, let's talk again tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Preface to Lushan Zhi by Zhang Taiyan <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>My friend Wu Zongci Ailin compiled the twelve volumes of Lushan Zhi. Yining Chen Shu preface it. The catalog is detailed. He asked me for a preface again. I said: "The ancient Lushan housed hermits and accommodated monks. The present Lushan is full of tigers and wolves and built with magnificent houses. There are dozens of famous mountains in China, from Mount Wutai to Zhongnan, Qingcheng, Diancang, and Emei. Huangshan and Kuocang are nearby. The land is either remote or on the main road, and ships cannot reach it. Only Lushan, backed by the Yangtze River, is easily accessible to foreigners and laymen. Those who want to hide in this place are indeed due to the terrain. However, from now on, the mountains will be more densely wooded and the markets will be more expansive. Those who want to hide in this place must be highly moralistic to be able to remember themselves. It is not sad if one cannot obtain what one seeks. However, is it not the greatest sorrow in the world to seek seclusion but not find a place to escape? Ailin is a man of the world, who has been walking north and south as a member of parliament for decades. He left because he could not speak out. Since then, he has not been subdued by injustice. He often lives in this mountain, hoping to stay away from madness and self-respect. The records he made in the Zhi are detailed about the ancient scenic spots and the changes in the present. The chapter on mountain politics is especially factual and can be used to prepare stories. The appropriateness of his feelings is not unknowable. In short, the Lushan of today is somewhat far from what Ailin expected. I now know that Heaven's encouragement of things is indeed not the same as the love and joy of sages." I wrote this on the title page. September of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Zhang Binglin.</p>

<p>"The potatoes are a bit smelly." They were all watery. The old smelly juice stains the fingers peeling the potato skin. The smell of these hands made people unhappy. But Mary was a good-tempered daughter. She could always endure the mill of the potatoes; because the colors, youth, and healthy atmosphere were rising in her whole body. When she finished peeling the potatoes and was free again, Anli couldn't bear it anymore. He hugged this daughter. She said: "Don't make jokes!"</p>
<p>Besides that, she didn't have anything else to say. She became silent. She had no more work to do. The time had come. Anli felt a faint sweetness on the corner of this daughter's lips, and saw a mole. At this time, the sound of the front door opening came. Fortunately, the door from the front door to the kitchen was closed. Mary whispered: "The master is back!"</p>
<p>There was no time to hesitate. But it was impossible to run away like this. Anli didn't know what crime it was to just run into someone's house. He accepted his fate even if it was a capital crime. Mary gave him a way to escape. He agreed without thinking.</p>
<p>In the corner of the kitchen, there was a dark room, about the size of a wooden cabinet, which was usually used to store dirty things. He had no choice but to run in there.</p>
<p>How many days did he stay inside? It took him a long time to realize that he had only stayed for a little over an hour. After a while, Mary came to call him, saying that Mr. Li Chai had left the house. Now, he could do whatever he wanted, but he only wanted to run away. He walked past this daughter and looked at her. Her eyes were big and dull. It made people feel that no matter how long they looked into her eyes, they would not find any expression. She looked so stupid. Even if she had beautiful cheeks, people would not notice them. She was fat and had small wrinkles, and her fingers looked swollen. There were many potatoes like her. She and the cow were only different in form. She smelled of domestic animals.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The high hurdles semi-final results were the most exciting of all groups. Both the first and second groups broke national records. In the first group, Xiao Dinghua initially led, but in the last two steps, Lin Shaozhou and Huang Yingwei surged ahead. In the second group, Liu Yingjun led from start to finish, with Chen Ling closely following. Liu's time of 16.3 seconds broke the national record of 16.5 seconds held by Jin Yan. However, the race was aided by a tailwind, which contributed to this result.</p>

The first place in the second group was Yu Xiulan, with a time of 28.5 seconds, also breaking the national record. However, the only flaw was the tailwind.</p>

<p>Shanghai swimmer Wen Jingling will depart for Beijing today. Because the swimming competition at the National Games will not begin until the 16th and classes at Shanghai University are very strict, Wen Jingling has remained at the school for practice in recent days. Since the school has a swimming pool, remaining at the school for practice is not much different from going to Beijing for training. Wen Jingling plans to depart on the morning train of the 13th with Peng Sanmei to participate in the National Games.</p>

<p>Gu Yu, the man from Shanghai who broke the national high jump record, is short and stout, and a native of Jiading, Jiangsu. He is 22 years old. He currently serves as the Director of Promotion at the Dahua Sports Equipment Company in Shanghai and the Guangdong Brothers Tree Company. He graduated from Shanghai Minli Middle School and studied education at Datong University for one year. Due to economic difficulties, he had to drop out midway and enter the world. His father worked in the transportation industry, and he deeply disapproved of Yu's sports pursuits. Later, Yu won a school championship, which greatly pleased his mother. Therefore, Yu worked harder, practicing the 100-meter dash, 100-meter hurdles, triple jump, and long jump. While in Shanghai, he received guidance from Mr. Sun Duogu, which further improved his skills. At the first National Games held in Hangzhou, at the age of 19, he finished fifth in the high jump. This time, he unexpectedly succeeded, all thanks to Mr. Sun's guidance and his own diligent practice. This time, his result was 1.81 meters, higher than his usual practice result, more than a foot above his head. In the future, he plans to study Japanese to prepare for studying in Japan, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Miss Li Yuanfen <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong female athlete, Li Yuanfen, broke the national long jump record yesterday. Her resume is of great concern to most observers. Miss Li is from Taishan County, Guangdong Province. Due to the large number of overseas Chinese in that county, she was exposed to and influenced by a progressive atmosphere from a young age, paying great attention to sports and possessing a natural talent for it. She began to show her talent when she was at the Guangzhou Municipal Normal School. At that time, the first National Games were held in Hangzhou. Miss Li was qualified to represent the school, but due to delays, we are only able to witness her heroic appearance today. Miss Li is currently a second-year student at the National Sun Yat-sen University High School. In March of this year, at the South China Four University Joint Sports Meet, she won the women's championship. She has exceptional achievements in various sports. When practicing the long jump, she exceeded five meters. However, due to the influence of the wind during yesterday's competition, the result was slightly reduced, but it still broke the national record. She has recorded 13.8 seconds in the 100-meter dash, reached 1.33 meters in the high jump, and over nine meters in the triple jump. Throwing a softball is also a specialty of Miss Li. At the first Guangdong track and field competition, she won first place with a score of 42 meters. This time, she is participating in the National Games, but due to regulatory constraints, she only registered for four events: the 50-meter dash, 100-meter dash, 400-meter relay, and long jump, which failed to fully demonstrate her talent. Miss Li also has expertise in academics and enjoys music. When reporters visited her, she was playing the harmonica and singing, with fluctuating rhythms and profound emotion, leaving a lingering and unforgettable impression. She is 18 years old this year, young and promising, with many talents and skills. It is hoped that she will work hard to create new records in various fields and bring glory to the country.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Observations from the Sidelines Yesterday: The Flowers of Hong Kong are Surrounded Everywhere <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Among the female athletes' outfits, the Hong Kong team's was the most distinctive, with rose-colored wool upper garments and patterned silk pants for sports, making them look like fairies. The most beautiful faces belonged to the famous swimming sisters, Yang Xiuqiong and Yang Xiushan, whose figures were also graceful and slender. Wherever the beautiful horses went, they were surrounded by crowds. The temporary shops and restaurants were crowded at mealtimes. For a time it was felt that the flowers of Hong Kong were a bit over the top, which caused the Yang sisters some distress.</p>
<h3 id="e245">The Order of the Games is Gradually Improving <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>On the second day of the Games, the weather was overcast, and the number of spectators decreased by six or seven tenths. Traffic was no longer obstructed, and the order of the venue was gradually improving. Only a few thousand people dotted the stands of the athletic field. News reporters could also access the east command platform, and the radio broadcast of results was also very clear. It can be said that things are gradually improving.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Wang Zhengting Praises Liu Changchun <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, a member of the Organizing Committee of the Games, arrived at the venue at 9:30 AM with his wife, Miss Smillie, and took a high seat on the west command platform. He carried a program, listened to reports, and recorded them in the program at any time, repeatedly saying that the results were not bad and that he was very interested. When Liu Changchun appeared in the third group during the 100-meter semi-finals, there was a burst of applause. As the starting gun fired, he ran like the wind. Cheng Jinguan initially took the lead, but after 30 meters, Liu intensified his pace. Cheng initially gritted his teeth and tried to compete, but after 50 meters, he could not sustain his strength and gradually fell behind. By the time he reached the finish line, Liu had left Cheng five or six meters behind. Mr. and Mrs. Wang clapped their hands loudly, repeatedly saying that the veteran was impressive and rare. When they heard that the result was 10.7 seconds, they praised him even more.</p>
