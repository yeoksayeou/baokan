<p>起草建議問題討論無些㣲結果</p>
<p>竟有人主張仍送回行政院辦理</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會今晨開會、對於日本倉卒提出之不合時宜的新提議、即斷然决定拒絶討論、預料中日問題之解决、將以李頓報告書第九章中之十項原則爲依據、至如何獲得美俄之合作、及報告書公布後如何排除阻碍見諸實施、則將於下星期一（六日）繼續討論、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會今日雖已拒絶討論日本之新提案、但仍令秘書長德魯蒙轉告日代表松岡、苟日本能接受十二月間之决議草案、調解仍屬可能云、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今晨十時三十分起集議兩小時半、會衆研究日本提議、費一小時、卒决定日本提議爲不可接受、但亦决定向日代表松岡告以日本現尙可於兩種修正下接受十二月間之决議、其所謂兩種修正者、即㈠不請美俄參加、㈡理由說明書改爲宣言、日本對此可提出保留是也、特委會旋從各點討論其建議問題、其所議定者、爲特委會應否作解决提議、抑僅作普通提議、會衆各發言互相討論、但一般意見似皆主張以李頓報告書第九章中之十點爲建議之根據、特委會下屆會議、將於星期一日午前十時半舉行、十九特委會之報告書現漸具切實形式、而其建議亦將結晶、至於前途如何、則會衆之意見漸分兩派、一派主張向兩造提出報告、以示國聯大會與此爭議不復有直接關係、此問題當然須復歸於國聯行政院、其他一派則主張將此報告書提交國聯全體會員國、而十九特委會或另一同樣團體應維持存在、以監視建議之實行、查此第二主張所持之理由、爲依照三月十一日之决議案、特委會在法律上有此權力、蓋因該决議案含有國聯大會職在阻止違反條約奪取土地之意義也、今日集議中所發現之重要事實、爲調解門户今猶未閉、而十二月十五日向日本提出附以修正兩條接受草决議案之貢獻、今猶存在、衆意日本不爲理由說明書所束縛、而可提出保留、庶東京或可接受特委會此次最後供獻也、特委會已遵委書長德魯蒙與松岡接洽、以便討論此問題、特委會旋討論建議問題、但會衆言論頗涉散漫、對於應採之方針未有解决、有若干人贊成建議須具有解决此項爭議的切實方法之意見、至於承認「滿洲國」之問題、則似未議及、關於中國所請規定期限一節、會衆咸以爲此事應由國聯大會决定之、故預料大會可於本月中旬召集、會塲中有若干人言及制裁辦法、爲報告書中一種天然推繹之可能性、此說未得一般之贊助、不過衆所同意者、特委會之建議應以李頓報告書第九節之十點爲根據耳、小國代表表示堅强情感、以一特委會之建議、應申斥日本破壞盟約之行爲、但會衆對於此種見解之討論、仍無一定辦法也、十九特委會之會議進行甚緩、報告書能否於星期四日脫稿、似屬疑問、但衆料起草問題仍將於下星期中提交九人小組會辦理、蓋小組會辦事較爲迅速也、</p>
<p>會塲公報　散會後發出公報如下、十九特委會今日集議、由波爾康主席、特委會收到起草委員會交來之報告書第一段原文、此項報告書、特委會日後可根據盟約第十五條第四節提交國聯大會、特委會又收到中政府請求加速進行手續、並决定盟約第十二條下期限之來文、並收到日代表送來某種新提案、特委會於愼重考慮日本新提議後、固嘉尙日方作此建議之精神、但悵然斷定日本建議在根本上與十二月十六日特委會之提議不相適合、即與修正之提議以迎合日政府之意思者、亦復相差甚遠、故不能與盟約第十五條第三節下調解手續之美滿根據、且鑒於調查委員團之建議、尤不能認爲滿意辦法、特委會請秘書長將此意見轉交日代表團、並向之說明特委會可有成功機會之唯一基礎、厥在日政府之接受十二月十六日特委會提議、而附以已經表示之兩種變更、即删除非會員國加入調解委員會一條、及依允兩造有權對於主席代表十九特委會所提出之理由說明書提出保留是也、特委會並諭令秘書長向日代表說明盟約第十五條第三節之調解手續依然有效、至國聯大會根據第十五條第四節通過報告書時而後止、但鑒於談判時期已久、而特委會對於協定之謀取、致力已多、故同時不得不進行報告書之起草工作、此項工作在比較的短少時期内即可完成、一俟脫稿、國聯大會即可立即召集、特委會今已開始交換其對於此報告書及其建議之意見云、（四日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c45">顧祝同槍决劉煜生案　穗 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>去歲七月間江蘇省政府主席顧祝同。藉口反動。非法逮捕鎭江江聲日報經理劉煜生。并長時期拘禁。迨一月十一日復處劉以死刑。又封閉江聲日報。此一案件。以監察委員劉莪青等之彈劾。而始得揭露於全國。今已爲國人所共同注目之一大問題。</p>
<p>據顧氏所宣佈劉煜生之罪狀。爲該報副刋所載文字。含有反動嫌疑。鼓吹階級鬥爭。復據蘇省府復行政院呈文中陳述劉煜生之罪狀。於副刋文字反動一點外。更謂劉曾在十六年一月間結合共黨分子組織非法工會。煽惑車夫罷工。又謂適用出版法以裁制報館。適用戒嚴條例以審判犯罪人。在戒嚴區域内戒嚴司令部有權辦理。於處死劉煜生。法令皆有根據。不應以普通法理平時狀况相責難。其所援引其所辯護。固未嘗不振振有辭。然而據監察員劉莪青等報告。則爲該報副刋所載諸文。僅爲描寫我社會生活狀况之作品。則劉氏最重要之犯罪證據。即已不能成立若以劉於十六年曾組織非法工會。爲其犯罪之又一證據則此種舊賬。殆亦算不勝算。民十六實際領導政治之人物中。今日因不少仍爲中樞領袖也。劉之犯法證據。旣不充分。則所引徵之出版法與戒嚴條例。即根本失其依據。誠所謂欲加之罪。何患無辭矣。</p>
<p>查人民應享有言論出版之自由。在國民黨黨綱上。在訓政時期之約法上。都有明白之保障。顧氏此次槍决劉煜生。不啻直接蹂躪人權。而間接即毁棄國民黨黨綱與約法。則此一案之意義嚴重。可不言而喻。吾人處此當前之情勢下。捨迫切要求政府保持法治國之精神。與法紀之尊嚴。嚴繩負責人員以法而外。更復能有何言。若政府於此而忽視之。則將來繼劉案而起者。恐將不患無人。人民生命。毫無保障。能不爲之寒心乎。</p>
<p>新聞記者之職責爲訴說人民之痛苦。爲傳達公正之輿論。此種神聖之職責。而苟失所保障。即我輿論界一日不能存立於世界。且此種現象。爲今日世界文明各國所不容有。故吾人爲維護人權計爲維護法紀鞏固中央之威信計。甚希望政府對於此事。有公正適當之處置。</p>

<p>大連日警組織航空巡邏隊</p>
<p>（東京）海陸相已向貴族院切實聲明、謂日本之海陸軍對於空防、已有切實之準備、對於空軍之發展、已在積極進行中、故無另設空軍者之必要、此項聲明、係答政友會交友俱樂部會員水野所提出之質問者、水野聲稱、蘇俄新近改變其五年計劃、而積極充實國防、不啻對日而發、而日本之空軍能力、並不能副全國之需要、故有另行設立航空省之必要、水野又引述張學良氏有五百架飛機、因缺乏駕駛人材之故、遂將該項飛機存入貨棧、故日本如一旦有意外之事發生、是否亦將陷入同樣之困境、水野且作驚人之語、謂松岡正從事於「使世界認清日本所處之地位、」倘使彼不能成功、則日本必須準備爲自身生存之奮鬭、此種危機已日臻嚴重、故民衆應明瞭目前之實在情形也云云、</p>
<p>陸相荒木答稱、日本以前並未正式參加歐戰、故一切戰器均不若列强進步之速、故空軍之發展、亦因是而遲緩、然目前日本之航空熱、已達極點、並指出軍部預算表曾撥出一部份經費、爲少年飛行隊之用、以期使全國青年對於航空、均感興趣、彼認爲即使有空戰發生、人民亦能自衛也云云、</p>
<p>海相大角宣稱、海軍方面已在極力提倡航空、彼承認水野所稱日本防空之力殊爲薄弱之說、但須知日本已有應付任何危機之準備、至於海軍、則謀以最小之消耗、而獲最大之效能、與列强一相較量、至於另行設立航空省一事、大角海相認爲並非需要、且有害無利、此問題已曾加以研究、即以美國而論、在先亦嘗將此問題詳加以討論、然終覺此事不能實行、大角海相末稱、海軍省已戮力同心、進行提倡空軍、並云、第一期之少年航空學生、已將畢業云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（大連）此間警察不日將組織航空巡邏隊、因向倫敦訂購蛾式偵查機兩架、其一不日即將運到也、聞將來該隊之任務、係擔任偵察南滿鐵路沿線地帶、以大連機塲爲司令部、而以無線電與此間警察互通消息、該隊最大之任務、爲報告義軍之蹤跡云、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>東京國民新聞云、美國大西洋偵察艦隊、自一九三二年度海軍大演習以來、仍將艦隊停泊於太平洋岸、目下亦參加檀香山攻守大演習、現美國海軍省新在山彼得羅附近、建築一大海軍根據地、以收容全美海軍、今已訓令戴皆生少將與約翰中佐、調查太平洋岸、選定適當地點、同時聯全艦隊司令官李提督、進言太平洋岸應立即建築大海軍根據地之必要、其目的爲防備戰事勃發、確保國防之安全、最近美國朝野因聞日海軍將在委任統治地區南洋諸島洋上、舉行海軍大演習、復引起重大的衝動、蓋日本在南洋方面演習海軍、與美國此次以檀香山爲中心之海軍大演習、頗有劍拔弩張之勢、因此美國國民對於日本海軍之行動與輿論、亦極感不安云、</p>
<p>東京朝日新聞云、山彼得羅港、現經議會通過决行大擴張、因太平洋岸之南山台哥港、雖可收容水雷艇潛水艦、然不能容多數大艦、而舊金山雖有收容力、卒不及山彼得羅地勢之險要、今美國海軍當局、已着手計畫防波堤與其各種設備、適値極東形勢緊張、議會對於該案、遂允承認通過云、</p>

<p>擴大戰車隊加緊訓練軍用犬鴿</p>
<p>（東京）據陸軍省發言人今日與路透訪員談及陸相荒木近在議會發表之言論時聲稱、關於開始進攻熱河事、尙未作最後决議、但和平解决之希望已絶、關東軍現正從事攻熱之必要準備、該發言人因軍事原因、關於戰事是否將延及京津區一節、不願作肯定語、謂關關東軍草擬戰事策略時、深覺宜力避危及華北之外人生命財產、訪員問以如攻熱戰事、一旦開始日本將否續派援軍、發言人答稱、現望無需派援、但如有必要時、準備遣派云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）在熱邊每日有激烈戰爭、但雙方主力部隊尙未接觸、據軍事家方面消息、總攻熱河時期、因援兵調動未完、且對國聯影響重大、故日軍部待國聯援用十五條第四項勸告書通告後、開始總攻、目前仍不斷以飛機轟炸熱河、擾亂我軍陣地、（四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）荒木陸相今日下午在下院預算分科會答稱、日陸軍部認爲駐滿兵力不足、定今年内加以補充、關於現有在滿兵力、將在秘密會上述說、繼謂日陸軍部决定展延在營年限、藉此增加三分之一常備兵、並擴大戰車隊、預定在今年中完成戰車隊二聯隊、支出經費五萬元、飼育軍用犬隊、預定在預算通過後、向歐洲某國收買軍用犬三百匹、交千葉步兵學校訓練、駐東三省獨立守備隊新派軍用犬及軍用鴿各三百頭、以供前線使用、（四日華聯電）</p>

<p>贊成論者的的意見可注意</p>
<p>日本自侵略東北三省、一年以還、太平洋之戰雲、依然密佈、日本旣苦國内經濟之恐慌、又懼俄美勢力的威脅、滿洲一臠、勢將不能安然下咽、是故半年以來、日俄締結不侵條約的空氣、宣揚於朝野、而事實之出現、又珊珊其遲、據此間内田外相對新聞記者的談話、雖謂日俄「滿」三國疆界、犬牙相錯隨時可發生爭議、若日俄「滿」三角委員會成立、則可相機調解、關於此委員會問題、現正由哈爾濱俄日領署代表相機討論、一俟駐俄新任日大使到莫斯科後、俄日政府、即可開始作關於此事之正式談判云云、但此間近適發現紅白紙小傳單、用俄日兩國文字印就、要求與蘇俄絶交、於此亦可見日本人民對俄惡感甚深、締約之說、事實上恐難辦到、</p>
<p>可是日本人士、對於日俄締結不侵犯條約問題、見解極不一致、有的極端反對締結、有的則竭力贊成、茲將此間所傳各方面對於該問題的意見、臚述大意如下、一部分人說、蘇俄是共產主義的、日本是資本主義的國家、就國體（立國之本）說、日俄斷無提携之可能、而且也不應該提携、且基於這個觀點、日本却非進攻蘇俄不可、因爲日本乘此千載難遇之良機、以滿洲爲立足點、豎走消滅無產階級專政的共產主義國家的旗幟、一方面旣可博得英美法意德等資本主義列强的同情、同時使「滿洲國」獲得世界的承認、克服了國聯、克服了中國、輕輕的將滿洲問題「不了而了」了、他方面、蘇俄自革命以來、對於國内經濟建設、慘淡經營、煞費一番血與肉的努力、茲者五年計畫尙待完成、國内軍備製造、尙未臻於完善、故其年來的外交政策、一反其歷來的革命强硬外交、而急轉直趨於和平外交、是可見蘇俄今日所最切要者、爲緩和邦交、講信修睦、勵精圖治、以養國力、若日本不利用速戰、則他日蘇聯國力逐漸擴張、恐一發有不可收拾之勢、</p>
<p>政友會會員方面、對日蘇締結不侵、條約事、内部意見、亦甚相左、日本外務省自己對於此事、亦復各有主張、各不相謀、贊成者大都謂日俄邦交、愈趨密切、則日本可獲較大的利益、反對者則以共產思想勢將蔓延日本爲辭、但雙方目前對蘇俄皆無好感、因莫斯科發表關於此事之往來文件、而不稍稍顧及日本暫不發表之請求、又駐日俄使照會中、日外相認爲有侮謾之字句云云、</p>
<p>此外尙有一派言論、最爲奇特、可名之曰騎牆派、因爲他們一方承認締約之利、他方又懼怕共產思想之汜濫國内、故此派人之結論曰、日俄締結不侵條約、於我（指日本）是有利的、但可惜時機未熟、尙稍有待呢、</p>
<p>最後、我們將宣傳最力自負觀點最明澈的贊成論者的主張、詳加分述一下、</p>
<p>贊成論者說、「滿洲國」的存在、這是鐵一般的事實了、然滿洲問題在國際上、尙未到達解决的時機、將來無論滿洲問題將作怎樣解决、其對日本民族是一個存亡興衰的關頭、是毫無可疑的、故當本問題行將解决之際、日本全民族須舉其全力以赴之、在這一點上來研究日俄不侵條約的締結問題、丨尤其在目前外交陷於孤立的當兒、丨日本更不能不表示贊成、使日本能藉以自拔、况且日俄不侵條約的締結、對於日本還有積極的更大的利益、非徒緩和外交而已呢、就間接方面說、他可使蘇俄得到轉換方向的機會、就直接方面說、第一·他可以拉攏蘇俄來承認「滿洲國」、然後日「滿」俄三國互相提携、繼續在國際政局中持久奮鬭、第二·從國聯圈外獲得蘇俄、可使國際政局轉爲有利於日本、第三·他可以减弱美國對付日本的壓力、第四·他可使中國的聯俄制日政策、頓成泡影、第九·與蘇俄通商、可以互得經濟利益的增進、第六·日美之間、萬一發生戰事、我國亦可藉此以縮短防線、日俄不侵條約締結後、日本所得的利益、贊成論者中、雖也論說紛紜、莫衷一是、但大都可以包括爲上面幾點、關於這幾點的理由、有的很明顯易曉、不費解釋、有的却需要一點簡單的說明、我們不妨再行細說一番、一、使蘇俄轉換方向、日本戰俄論者所持的理由、不消說是防遏蘇俄南下政策的伸張、固然、南下是俄國的傳統政策、說這個企圖蘇俄未嘗放棄、也是對的、但蘇俄的南下、並不必限於遠東方面的、日俄締約的贊成論者、倡言只有締結日俄不侵條約、是使蘇俄轉換方針到西方去的推進力、蘇俄方針的轉向東方來、尙俄較晚的事、即在俄土戰爭之後呢、其從前的南下政策、是趨向巴爾幹及中央亞細亞方面的、後因受英法德三國阻止、蘇俄才將他的方針、轉向壓力薄弱的東方來、這便是蘇俄南下政策轉向遠東之始、嗣後、英德法各就自己的利害立塲、慫恿蘇俄維持這個外交政策、但蘇俄自轉換方針到遠東來以後、便和日本成了對立、自從帝政被推翻、革命政府執政後、又將其從來以歐洲爲舞臺的外交活動、轉向東方來了、於是現在又大大的碰了一次日本的鐵壁、（東北事變）現在蘇俄在中央亞細亞方面、已有南下的趨勢、高加索方面、亦急急架設鐵道、經濟上亦有着着進展之勢、他方面從奴巴喜比里斯克至搭西金托的鐵道、架越帕米爾高原、南下便可直趨印度、贊成論者謂、日俄不侵條約的締結、可使俄國的政策、專趨這兩個方面、而放棄其遠東方面南下的企圖、目下在蘇俄方面、内政上有種種困難、是他的弱點、所以他不得不竭力廻避戰爭、而且無論是爲一時的或爲權宜的、他也總會向我提議締結不侵條約的、在目前國際政局中、日本對於滿洲問題、若能得到絶對有利的解决、日本將來的發展、是可預下的、若在這個問題的解决上、一有失錯、則不消說大陸上的發展、要受挫折、且有惹起日本國内危機之慮、而且當茲之際、蘇俄的承認「滿洲國」及蘇俄對日本的其他助力、都與國際上解决滿洲問題有關鍵、而今蘇俄因爲内政上的困難、來向我國提議訂立不侵條約、我們若不好好的利用如此良機、實不解其將何以善其後了、（未完）</p>

<p>（問）憲政時期之政府元首、採總統制乎、抑委員制乎、（答）根據總理建國大綱、明明規定爲總統制、其實國家元首名稱、總統可也、主席亦可也、其重要點在乎職權之規定、惟目前國民政府之組織係委員制、析其意義、顯應負荷整個國家施政之權衡、但同時行政院係向國民政府以外之另一會議機關負責、遂形成一般人所謂之責任内閣制、則國民政府已無事可做、本人見解、我國政制組織之系統、與歐美各國不必雷同、因國民政府下係五地並立、而政治之總樞紐集中於中央政治會議、如行政院　責任内閣、其他立法司法考試監察四院　樣聽命於中政會、試問其名稱將作何解、以故此後對於元首職權之規定、當不出兩途、㈠國家元首同時兼任行政首長、㈠國家元首僅負對内對外代表國家之名義、而不負施政之職責、何去何從、尙待討論後方可决定、</p>

<p>伍氏又謂、日軍攻熱、爲旣定事實、我國亦有相當準備、無論如何、當盡我十分力量、與敵週旋、使敵必以十二分之代價、取得我尺寸土地、至就軍事上言、我利在持久、敵利在速戰、故暫時之勝負、無足介意、必有眞正之長期抵抗、敵應付疲命、由軍事上之消耗、使其國内經濟趨於崩潰、弱點旣破、而最後之勝利、終屬於我矣、</p>

<h3 id="c189">我的自殺觀對否？ <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>｜任望月君來信｜</p>
<p>本欄讀者，有許多想自殺的人，都來問先生</p>
<p>，請先生解答，而先生解答的總是這幾句話：「自殺不是我們具有向上心的人類所應有的念頭，是懦者可恥的心理，」不錯，當然先生解答的是對的！但是也不能一槪而言之，眞出於不得已的自殺，我們似乎不能絶對的反對，至少它也有點相當的價値的。</p>
<p>有這幾種自殺，我是絲毫不反對而贊成的：㈠有一種人的自殺，是因爲身體不健康，而太衰弱了，覺得什麽事也不能去做，此生永久地（一直到死）過一種病夫式的消費生活，對國家没有一點生產，死了還好此。因身體的關　而自殺，先生，這種自殺你能認爲可恥嗎？㈡又有一種人的自殺是因爲給富人，闊少們使用，一生世過的是奴隸的生活，食不飽，穿不暖，而終日勞働無停休，生比死還要苦些，難道來到世間上就給富人闊少們用用嗎？要反抗衝破黑暗的奴隸的生活，　是又不可能，生的自由没有，死的自由却任何人都有的。這種自殺雖然是弱者的行爲，但也是思想澈底的人所爲的事。先生，這你認爲怎麽樣？㈢還有一種人的自殺，是神經過敏的人感到處處星苦悶的　感到人世間是空洞的，寂寞的，孤獨的，很少同情者，丨簡直是没有，環顧四圍，　是白眼，没有一個知己的人，一個體貼安慰的人，覺得毫無人生樂趣，不願過種孤獨無聊的生活，就毫不思議的絶世絶我的自殺了。先生，這種意志消極澈底的表現，你認爲有没有相當的價値呢？</p>
<p>致於爲愛女人失戀而自殺，爲容貌而自殺······這種種的自殺，我當然也認爲一點價値也没有的。</p>
<p>最後要請先生答覆的就是我快要實行第㈢條自殺了。因爲我環境窮困，而又帶了點壯志雄心，不會交際，拍馬屁的交際。先生，怎麽辦？望你能够給我一個詳細圓滿的回覆的，我是感激得很！</p>
<p>答：來信所贊成的三種自殺，在我們看來，通統應該反對：爲什麽呢？一個人只要有健全的精神與思想，就使他是瞎子，聾子，跛子，都有他的工作效能，都有他盡力於社會的機會，若果「因爲身體不健康，而太衰弱了」便要自殺。老實說，中國人總要自殺一大半。因爲中國人的身體不健康的非常多，若是同西洋人的體格比起來，十有八九都是「太衰弱了。」我們若果處在這種境界，就應該追求致　「身體不健康」「太衰弱」的社會的原因與生理上，衛生上的原因，和　奮鬭，自己雖因此而犧牲，還留得他的事跡與經騐以遺後人、以視他的消極自殺，相去眞不可以道理計，這是我們反對足下所舉第一種自殺的理由；奴隸之於主人，若果吃不了他的苦，受不了他的壓迫，在主人方面看來，最好是你自殺，免得他來費手脚。「自由」眞自由矣！然而這種自由，只是奴隸對於主人無條件屈服之最「澈底的」行爲　若果拿這種自由來替他自己無條件屈服的態度辯護，那便是無恥的心理。至於你說「要反抗衝破黑暗的奴隸的生活，但又不可能」，爲什麽不可能？他曾經怎樣地「反抗」？怎樣地打算「衝破」他們「黑暗的奴隸的生活」？請有以語我來！要知道黑暗的奴隸的生活是壓迫社會與不平等的社會的一種黑暗勢力形成的，要打破這種黑暗勢力，非結合社會上極偉大，極堅决的革命力量，並蘊蓄着極悠久，極寳貴的鬭爭的經騐，並挾有極堅强，極穩固的戰爭組織，不能達到成功。現在有一班人，也許是自號極聰明的人，他們口頭上也會一口氣說出許多平等，自由，文明，野蠻，打破，打倒，奮鬭，等等字眼兒，好像都是革命的英雄，奮鬥的好漢，然而一旦和黑暗勢力接觸，他便棄甲曳兵而逃，埀頭喪氣而意氣消沉，一點積極的精神都没有了。假使黑暗勢力果眞如他們所想像的那樣最易打破，那他們豈不是都成了歷史上英雄了嗎？我且說一段故事給你聽：「威王八年，楚大發兵加齊，齊王使淳于髠之趙請救兵，齎金百金，車馬十駟。淳于髠仰天大笑，冠纓索絶，王曰，「先生少之乎」？髠曰，「何敢。」王曰，「笑豈有說乎？」髠曰：「今者臣從東方來，見道傍有穰田者，操一䐁蹄，酒一盂，而祝曰：甌　滿篝，汚邪滿車，五穀蕃熟，穰穰滿家，臣見其所持者狹而所欲者奢，故笑之。」（史記游俠列傳）你要想衝破奴隸的網羅。你就得拚死命，就得和這種勢力决鬥一毫不讓，前仆後繼，主人總有塌台的日子，若終日幻想着奴隸的地位的解放，而又不敢和主人做生死的鬥爭，那便是「所持者狹而所欲者奢。鎭日價，叩頭禮拜，禱告上帝的慈悲，主人的恩惠，大開方便給你解放固然是痴想可憐，即使你無聊自殺，在主人看來，也不過死了一條狗，正好，死了一條没用的狗！這也算得自由麽？奴隸的自由是爭得來的，不是人家施捨的：奴隸的自由是生活的自由，不是自殺的自由。自殺的奴隸不但在人世脫離不了黑暗的生活，即使有天堂地獄之說，那他也還是要打，在地獄裏。因爲人鬼的社會是一樣的，你在人世不能鬥爭，那你在陰間依然是個小胆鬼，依然是要給强者做奴隸！哈哈！假使　奴隸要自殺，我們還要勸他慢慢瞧！足下平心思之，這種自殺的人，「也是思想澈底的人」嗎？所謂「澈底」究屬何謂？這是我們反對你所舉的第二種自殺的理由。「感到處處是苦悶的，」爲什麽呢？「感到人世是空虚的，······尹少同情者丨簡直是没有」又爲什麽呢？你以爲怎樣才不苦悶呢？駟馬高車？豐衣足食？驕妻美妾？你以爲怎樣才不空虚呢？做官做到主席？發財發到哈同？你以爲你是怎樣一個了不得的人，爲什麽應該同情於你呢？你有什麽可以引起人家同情的學識與才能呢？你的演說有天才嗎？你的文學有偉大的創作嗎？你有什麽發明嗎？你有什麽出衆驚人的技巧嗎？請你捫心自問一下，包你汗下如　，廢然而返　果然到了後來，露了馬脚了：你要自殺，爲的是你「環境窮困，而又帶了點壯志雄心，不會交際，拍馬屁的交際。」這不是馬脚嗎？可見得你只是耐不得「窮困」，而在你看來，所以致此「窮困」又因爲「不會交際，」拍馬屁的交際。」這在你實在有點可惜，爲什麽你曰不會」呢？假使你一會，那豈不是什麽問題都解决了？窮困也没了，也不空虚了，也没苦悶了，自然也就從自殺戀爲樂生者了！然而我們從社會方面設想，你不會拍馬屁的交際，正是社會的幸福，因爲人羣之中少了一個害羣之馬。你若果以此存心，那你眞自殺，在社會上也就無足重輕了。我這種喜笑怒駡的答覆，似乎不近人情，實則我一眼看到你滿懷的小市民的智識分子的一種儌倖成功而又消極失望的心理，不痛痛地給你打破，煞是危險。足下試靜心一思，凡你所舉三種自殺的心理，那一種能逃出我們以前的解答：「自殺不是我們具有向上心的人類所應有的念頭，是懦者可恥的心理」？假使我們的答覆不能滿你的意，請再賜敎以便討論。</p>

<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>貴與賤</p>
<p>富與貴，原是兩件有連環性的東西，人貴了之後，家產自會富起來；暴富的人，也會漸漸的貴起來，古人以爵祿爲貴，現代的人却不在乎此，有錢的就是貴人，所謂「大亨」，卽上海之貴人也。</p>
<p>現代中國貴人，在上海多半置有不動產，就能算是上海市民，這是固定的貴人，上海是南北東西的交通樞紐，爲中外貴人往來必須經過之地，上中下三等旅館裏，潛伏着盈千累萬的過去，未來和現任的貴族旅客，這是流動的貴人，以固定的貴人爲經，流動的貴人爲緯，交織而成上海的貴族社會。我們睜開眼眶來一看，但見憧憧往來的都是貴人。</p>
<p>上海的貴人固多，賤人却也不在少數。馬路上拉客的野鷄，一夜身價祗消三數袁頭，定價可謂奇賤。這還是顯而易見的賤人，隱藏在社會暗處的，尙有各種意想不到的賤人，如「人獸奇觀」，「男妓」，和供人參觀的秘戲，等等，皆貴族社會中特產之賤貨也！</p>
<p>上海人的性命有貴至十萬元以上者（以人壽保險爲標準），汽車碾死的貧民，有時祗値二三十元，上海人價的貴賤，相差的比數也就很可觀了！</p>
<h3 id="c219">打倒暮氣 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>｜俾晝作夜｜</p>
<p>暮氣萬萬要不得。一個人暮氣一深，不拘幹甚麽事，都是「媽媽虎虎」，所有的精神，也無非是「得過且過」。因爲暮氣深的人，都已去死不遠，今天不知明天是否尙在人世，樂得「今朝有酒今朝醉了」。前清的尙書宰相，十九都是科甲出身，待到舉人翰林一步一步爬上去，不客氣，都已夠得上進祠堂的資格了。請敎這些日薄崦嵫的老骨董去改造中國，簡直是請不出閨門的老太太去設計二十世紀的新裝。所以現在的國民政府裏，除了幾位黨國元勳之外，很少花白鬍子的辦公人員。這就足以表示要有充滿朝氣的政治，壓根兒不可請敎充滿暮氣的人去幹。</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨」，這二句話，十足的顯示着我們不可輕輕地放過了一個「朝」字。我們普通的辦公時間，都是從上午九時起下午五時止。其實上午九時，已經近午，早已無所謂「朝」。一到午後，日色西橫，已滿含着「暮氣」。在這種辦公時間内辦公，當然已辦不出充滿「朝氣」的事了。所以我現在有一個不知進退的提議請大家把辦公時間，改爲從半夜二點鐘起，到十點鐘。這八小時内，由黑暗而逐漸光明，「朝氣」之重，也無以復加了。</p>
<p>「暮氣」籠罩了大地，大家都睡在夢裏，待到一有了「朝氣」，大家都起來工作。我想這辦法，或許可肅清現在社會上的一切暮氣，而發生一種蓬蓬勃勃的氣槪。假使我們老是這樣糊糊塗塗的把朝氣重的時間，睡在夢裏，而在暮氣裏辦事，那麽，莫想把「老大中國」改成「少年中國！」</p>

<p>— 來澄源</p>
<p>｜子路糊塗｜</p>
<p>春秋時候。孔二先生因爲吾道不行，一怒之下，就要出洋，想到外國混過幾年，遇有機會，再捲土重來！但是他口裏雖喊得振天價響，乃足還是不良於行。其實：他老人家發發脾氣；板板臉孔，無非故意動動人家的聽聞罷了。他也何嘗不知道出洋是多麽的危險！風浪是很大；航行是顚簸。以偌大的年紀，這樣毫無意識的和馮夷拚命，難保不以卵投石！可笑子路戇頭戇腦，信以爲眞，像煞從夫子出洋，舍由莫與！孔子見他糊塗得可憐，不曉得他（孔子）肚皮裏的先天玄機；不覺喟然而嘆曰：「由也，好勇過我，無所取材！」</p>
<p>於此一端：我們就可以引證古時候的人，除了老孔能夠賣弄少，聰明之外，其餘的人的頭腦泰半是簡單不過的。出洋問題，不是一個很好的例子嗎？假使子路生在幾千年後的今日，夫子閙着出洋的話；他靈機一動，計上心來，儘可用無線電廣播的說說：「夫子之出洋也，由不與焉。夷狄上犯，留爲國用！」橫豎日本兵還没有打到山東（魯），放幾嚮無藥大砲，給民衆們吃幾個空心湯糰，也許可以博得一箇英雄的頭銜呢？</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>｜於國家何補？</p>
<p>在機關裏，女職員有過紅花瓶的綽號，意思是没有能力，不過裝飾而已；其實也不能將所有的女職員一筆抹殺，能力好的也有。因爲談裝飾品，我們自到都市中的許多女性，却有很多是自甘做裝飾品，去供給悅己者的玩好，身上穿滿了西洋的綢緞，臉上掩蔽了天然的美，用多量的粉，香水，眉黛，口紅去人工來裝點，同時大都趨向於唯物的享樂，有的甘心出賣了她們的肉體，向金錢下拜，願拿自己的肉體交換享樂，她們所須的是高大洋房，汽車，鋼琴，高跟鞋，絲襪，時髦的衣裳，華麗的飾物，野　絨，　菜，花旗　子，金山蘋菓，巧克力糖，葡萄酒，蔻拉沙，出入於影戲院，跳舞場，公園，飯店，總會。試問這樣的國民，不論男女，於國家何補？</p>
<p>做一個人到底做一個有用的，還是願做行屍走肉的裝飾品？假使這樣去問人家，誰都會說願做有用的人，但社會上多餘的裝飾品充滿了眼前，有路還向這條沉澱滅落的路上走去，我不禁抱了無窮的悲哀！</p>

<p>這裏，她所飾的是交際花金意鴻，是一個貴族階級的小姐。當然，有純粹的國語，迷人的酒渦，靈活的眼睛，婀娜的身姿，自然不愧爲一個名符其實的交際花。</p>

<p>近代科學發達，戰塲上所用的器械，眞奇妙極了。譬如利用狗去偵探敵人的情形，利用鴿子去傳遞書信，最奇的是德國從前大戰時，用鴿子去照照相。鴿子攝影的方法，即把自動的照相器，縳在鴿的胸前，鴿子飛到敵陣的空中，那照相器受了鴿爪一動，自動的攝取敵陣的形勢了。所以没有飛機去偵察的時候，可用鴿子代替這工作，不過訓練軍用鴿，是很難的。</p>

<p>（滬南米市到多銷滯）昨來源四十餘號浦中存積以連日來源較多、去路不暢、存積見厚、加之零胃呆滯、雖包胃已有行家上棧貨千餘石、市况終見軟弱、蘇同帮及南港青角等米、價續跌二角不等、杜洋尖及陰元雖屬乏貨、形勢已不若前日緊俏、故價跟落角許、廠家惟羊尖開出、價照舊盤、常帮以内河冰凍未融無來源、</p>
<p>（滬北米市銷呆價跌）昨日河下各帮來船十餘艘、白粳走化均屬滯細、市形又小二三角、薄粳早稻到雖無幾、零化交滯、包胃不動、價亦跌三角、羊杜尖來貨略有、去路尙可、價小角外、埠尖乏到、客尖疲尺外、陰元到少銷滯、價小二三角、白元疲角外、</p>
<p>（客秈本客續有去化）客秈市况、到銷兩淡、惟本客雙方均有應酬、市面尙能站立、惟暫時尙難活潑、大約須元宵節後、客帮始有活動之望、昨福州去蕪元米四百四十五包、價開十元零四角八分至十元零四角半、又與本街辦去江西機晚三百四十包、價九元一角半至八元八角二分、本街獨辦湖南機紅米二百三十包、價八元六角半至八元五角半、</p>
<p>（洋商兜售一號西貢）洋米存底依然擯住、市上略有胃口、因貨主堅持、故均改辦客秈矣、惟洋商聞此消息、多有到市兜賣、昨日元利有三四月電報來市求攬、係一號西貢米、價四兩三錢、行家心思已經活動、然當日則無成交云、</p>
<p>（荳銷尙可餅銷見動）雜糧市依然寂寞、黃荳車坊及廠家辦胃尙接、成交火車荳四車、本街採取大連荳二車、崇明沙黃荳福州帮辦去四百餘包、市情高貨轉立、中次仍平疲、餅銷見動、勢能上升、南京缸荳因問津尙續、市見站立、芝蔴洋莊雖有問訊、尙無所交、惟零星尙有走化、市還平穩、生仁高平次殺、花生立定、</p>

<p>（期麥交清市少起色）昨期麥市面、上午各月份交易、異常清淡、祇二五月份做開幾車、迨至下午開盤、交易較暢、市價亦趨低落、因三兩五錢可定之澳麥、又兜售不已、故人心復虚、近遠各期、均告不穩、七月份新麥、以洋麥之故、抛户亦見湧旺、至本月份局面、以抛户均有洋麥抵數、如廠方不收、前途恐變化正多也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、三月份跌三分、四月份跌四分、七月份跌二分云、</p>

<p>純銻近日開價異常堅硬、標準估盤已至二百七十兩、聞其漲價原由、半因產地受共匪之蹂躪、來貨奇少、半以本埠市塲因歐銷發展、市貨供不敷求、囤户居奇、販户壟斷、暴升二十兩之多、聞昨成交二十餘噸、</p>

<h3 id="c248">怎樣才是好胡桃｜胡桃滋味好　廉 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>「形質」胡桃一名核桃。性滋補。味甘芬。有油質。其衣味澀。其殼可作燃料。產於天津等處。貨品之標準。大都不外㈠個子大。㈡殼白而薄。㈢肉份足而白。㈣身骨干燥。茲更將各種貨品之形質略述如下。手揀桃　個大均匀。殼白而薄。肉足身干。</p>
<p>東昌桃　個子略有大小。殼白略厚。肉足身干。</p>
<p>昌平桃　個大小不一。殼微紅較厚。肉足身干。</p>
<p>平谷桃　與昌平桃相仿。</p>
<p>石門桃　個大小不一。殼厚嵌肉。肉份較遜。身干。</p>
<p>毫州桃　個小。殼白尙薄。肉份不足。身骨較軟。</p>
<p>東桃　　個大小不一。殼稍厚。肉白不足。身份較軟。</p>
<p>商𨿅桃肉肉色白。整粒多。碎屑少。身份干。�</p>
<p>天津桃肉　略同。</p>
<p>洋莊桃肉　敲法各異。以整個（桃球）爲最上。對分者次之。四分者更次之。更須色白粒大爲合格。</p>
<p>「防變」黃霉時。身份軟者。易於發霉走油。而生蟲蛀。桃肉因無外殼保護。更易變壞。故在此時期。有上冷氣間者。可無此虞。惟外費大。如貨本低尙有希望者。更能合算。然價高之貨。如有後望。亦可保本。</p>
<p>「食法」去殼。去衣。（以開水泡之即易剝脫）以鹽水炒之。即成「鹽水胡桃」。以白糖製之。則成「胡桃糖」。其味均美。「桃酥」以桃肉和冰糖放入小砶内。共搗極細。干食。或以開水冲食均佳。或以上好紹酒　食。有補力之效。或以上好桂圓去核嵌胡桃肉。或以上好黑棗去皮去核。而實以桃肉食之。均别有風味。其他如糕餅糰子等。在在均有需要。</p>
<p>「入藥」核桃中之桃夾。（即桃肉中之一層）以之浸酒。可治腰痛（勘誤）昨日生意經爲（四）誤刋（三）。合行更正。</p>

<p>— 侍桁譯</p>
<p>我看著那個人。没有一個普通不誠實的車夫，能够扯得出這樣確實而無中生有的大謊的。而且這個人並不是一個不誠實的車夫。如果曾有過一個人性的面孔是沈重，單純，卑屈，兩隻眼睛像蛤螞的眼睛假地突出着，如果曾有過（簡而言之吧），一個面孔是備具一切人性的面孔的本質的，那便是這個可恨而可敬的車夫的面孔。我上下地看着街道；一種不平常的昏暗的光彷彿是正要罩下來了。於是在一瞬間，那種懷疑論的老魔鬼又伸指敲在我的神經上了。什麽是確實？任何人是能够確實任何事體的麽？天哪！想着那不斷地追問我們是否領有一種過去的生活的懷疑論者的常套的口吻。對於眞實的懷疑論成爲一種興奮的問題的那是否我們是領有一種過去的生命。純理論地講，一分鐘以前，除去是一種傳說一幅圖畫之外，還能是什麽東西呢？路上的暗黑更變得深厚了。那個車夫對我靜靜地述說着，從我在尤斯屯車站外邊招呼他的那奇異的瞬間以來，我的一切姿勢，話語，複雜而一致的舉動，怎樣我能够曉得（我的那位懷疑論的朋友將說）我未曾在尤斯屯的外邊招呼過他呢？我是確認着我的主張，同時他是確認着他的主張。他顯然是和我同樣誠實的人，而且是作着一種更値得尊敬的職業的一個人。在那一瞬間，宇宙與星辰只因爲失　一髮的平衡，便動搖起來，宇宙的基礎被移動了。但就是爲了這同一的理由我相信飲酒，爲了這同一的理由我相信自由意志，爲了這同一的理由我相信美德的固定性，這種理由只能以「說我不願意當爲一個瘋子」而解釋出來的，我繼續地相信這個誠實的車夫是錯誤了，而我返覆地對他講我曾是確確實實在賴賽斯忒的角上　人來的。他開始以同樣確實而深重的純眞說，「您正在尤斯屯車站外邊招呼我的，那時您還說丨丨」</p>
<p>可是在這一瞬間，他的姿勢起了一種驚人的變形，就好和他從内部裏像一盞燈似地點起了火來。「喔，請您愿諒我，先生，」他說。「請您愿諒，請您愿諒。您是從賴賽斯忒廣塲雇我來的。我現在想起來了。請您愿諒。」這樣說着，這個奇異的人，發着尖銳的嚮聲揮起馬鞭，旋着車輪跑開了。這全部的塲景，我敢對着大英帝國的旗子起誓，是絶對地眞實。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>當他消失在遠方與霧中的時候，我看着這位奇異的車夫。我幻想着這個人的面孔雖然彷彿是非常地忠實，而若從後面看來也許他是懷着一種極惡的魔鬼似的氣質，這我不曉得是否是正確的。也許他是誘惑我在白日曾辯護過的確實的固執而被派了來的。但無論如何，這件事是給了一種使我記憶着我的「實在感」的愉快，雖然在一瞬間它曾將倒下了，而仍然又豎起來。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c273">航空救國三願 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>現在各色人們大喊着各種的救國，好像大家突然愛國了似的。其實不然，本來就是這樣，就在這樣地救國的，不過現在喊了出來罷了。</p>
<p>所以銀行家說貯蓄救國，賣稿子的說文學救國，畫畫兒的說藝術救國，愛跳無的說寓救國於娛樂之中，還有，據烟草公司說，則就是吸吸馬占山將軍牌香烟，也未始非救國之一道云。</p>
<p>這各種救國，是像先前原已實行過來一樣，將來也要實行下去的，决不至於五分鐘。</p>
<p>只有航空救國較爲别緻，是應該刮目相看的，那將來也很難預測，原因是主張的人們自已大抵不是飛行家。</p>
<p>那麽，我們不妨預先說出一點希望來。</p>
<p>看過去年上海報的人們恐怕記得，蘇州不是有一隊飛機來打仗的麽？後來别的都「迷失」了，只剩下洋烈士的那一架，兩拳不敵四手，終於給日本飛機打落，累得他母親從美洲路遠迢迢的跑來，痛哭一塲，帶了幾個花圈而去。聽說廣州也有一隊出發的，閨秀們還將詩詞繡在小衫上，贈戰士以壯行色，然而，可惜得很，好像至今還没有到。</p>
<p>所以我們應該在防空隊尙未成立之前，陳明兩種希望丨</p>
<p>一，路要認清，</p>
<p>二，飛得快些。</p>
<p>還有更緊要的一層，是我們正由「不抵抗」以至「長期抵抗」，而入於「心理抵抗」的時候，實際上恐怕一時未必和外國打仗，那時戰士技癢了，而又英雄無用武之地，不知道會不會炸彈倒落到手無寸鐵的人民頭上來的？所以還得戰戰兢兢的陳明一種希望，是！</p>
<p>三，莫殺人民！</p>

<p>— 每戡</p>
<p>寒雪，時間已是傍晚，路上的行人與車輛，可以說没有了，公寓中的一頭黑貓伏在我的床前打盹。這樣冷的天氣，照理，房間裏應該安置火爐，可是今年的冬天，我就不曾生過爐子，並不是我不怕嚴寒，却是爲着舊有的那隻日本火缸，當一二八滬戰時遭了難，早已暴屍於吳淞砲台灣附近的一片瓦礫塲上了，那種粉身碎骨的慘狀，到現在想起來，還有點難過，這以後我就没有再去置備一個爐子。</p>
<p>患僂麻質斯疾的我，偏一到冷天，最容易復發，近來總算還好，除了兩腿間發疼痛外，其餘各部都很能舒適如恒，這不能不感謝上帝的寬大！</p>
<p>本來，在這樣下雪的日子，最好是坐在火爐邊，一邊以花生米過大花雕，一邊和美麗年青的女人喁喁情話，然而這樣的清福在我是並没有，雖說酒與女人都是我所愛好的，所謂「貂裘換酒，金屋藏嬌，」這些風雅的夢做了一輩子還不曾實現，想起來眞未免有點兒惆悵！</p>
<p>我老是會有這些胡思亂想，也許這就是小資產階級的劣根性。朋友們往往駡我，自己也時常覺得不應常作如是想，然而在無聊的時候，總免不了會想到這些上面去。</p>
<p>我確是矛盾得太厲害了！有時也這樣咀咒着自己。但我决不願遮掩着自己的壞處不給人家看，我以爲知道我的人當然會原宥我，不知道的就讓他去詬駡我好了，要想做一個八面玲瓏的人，事實上夠麻煩的，還是惟求心之所安，較爲便利。</p>
<p>夜將臨，整個房間好像浸在水裏，外面仍是下着很大的雪，預想明天的雪景當更有可觀。勁厲的朔風在窗子外面怒吼着，玻璃窗頻頻地在顫抖着，黯淡的電燈的光波，投不到各個黑暗的角落，寒氣侵蝕着我的皮膚，孤零零的自個兒几坐着，四周圍蕩漾着一種凄凉况味。　　喫過了晚　，無聊依然佔據着整個的心，想來想去還只有上床睡覺來得好些，時鐘的針還只躺在八字上打盹的當兒，就展開被窩跳進去裝睡了。</p>
<p>輾轉着，輾轉着，被窩依然鐵一般冷，暖氣不知道消散到那兒去了！早就想「摟着虚空睡到明」的，誰知連這一點福分也没有，冷得連睡都不可能，今夜又失眠了！</p>
<p>失眠對於僂麻質斯病患者是極不利的，果然，半夜裏兩腿又發起痛來。</p>
<p>左右鄰室的鼾聲在驕傲地響着，我還是毫無睡意，伸首看看床邊的黑貓也已睡得深沉了，我不禁有點嫉妒起來！</p>

<p>— 問鵑女士</p>
<p>我們也跟着走去，跨進了關帝廟的大門，但是滿目荒凉，只有院子中央的一口大井，還巍然存在着。Ｃ君告訴我們：「這口井，相傳就是三國時關公行軍過此，卓刀成泉的所在。」荒唐的神話本是無稽的，然而我却呆呆地望着牠出神了，這澄澄的井水，曾經照過我五年前的面影，也曾照過另一個友人的面形，丨祝福他在天上的靈魂！那時節正是四月中旬，一個難得的休假日，我們出城散步，走到此地，因爲口渴，便在這裏的茶廳中喝了茶，歇了一下，於是起身往各處走走，在西邊的小院中，他爲我升到樹上去折了兩枝美麗的繡球花，這圓滿的花朶，彷彿正在羨慕我們的活躍的生命，張着她的眼睛，灼灼然向我注視。我們覺得在這樣緊張的日一當中，能夠抽空重溫一點詩意的生活，那趣味眞是難於言說的。彼此相期着：將來倘能解甲歸田，湖上騎驢的故事，我們是要再演的。於是我們各自在日記簿上記下了當日的游踪，以便他年重按。誰知留此殘痕，反增今日感傷的資料呢！</p>
<p>轉了一回，覺得十分無趣，便退回來，看到那坦蕩蕩的石路，依舊當年狀况，只是路旁所有的，已不是初夏的青葱，而只剩些枯乾了的花草的根株了。石路倘是有記性的，應該記得五年前的一幕丨一個表情沉毅氣槪軒昂的青年，同一個豪爽健康的女子的形象？然而那無情的石版，只給我一個冷淡的回答，牠的心已被人間的暴力踐踏成麻木的了。</p>
<p>惟有多情的小草，還在西風裏搖着她的憔悴的身軀，似乎在向我招呼。啊！小草！你似乎知道我的心事，故而露出你的悲愁的面目來和我表同情？從前初見，你我都是青春，現在呢！你被自然的威力所摧殘，我被人世的浪潮，奪去了生命中的生命，可是，啊！你的青春去了，還有再來的時候；我呢，死者已是不可復生，逝去了的青春也永無回來的一日了。</p>
<p>Ｃ君見我默默無言，便說：「這地方你似乎不大歡喜？」</p>
<p>「是的，這裏太蕭條了。」</p>
<p>兩個少年人聽了我的話，現出詫異的神氣，他們覺得我向來是最喜歡自然風景的人，何以會忽然厭倦起來呢！那知我此時的心早被悲哀鎖住，不能再說讚美自然的話了！</p>
<p>可Ｎ君把他的勇健的精神振落了我的回想。他把一隻石獅子舉起來了。</p>
<p>只有「力」！堅强的力，方是一切的出路，我明白了。「悲哀是弱者的表示，我不要自安於一個弱者的地位吧！」我心裏想，不覺已到汽車站了。</p>
<p>湖山帶着沉靜而含有深意的微笑送我們重上歸程，長途汽車的巨影衝破了周遭的一切黑暗。（完）</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他倆折回頭，朝西走，走到有名的Ｍ跳無塲來了。</p>
<p>還早了一點，音樂隊還没有上台。只來了五六個大槪不甚行時的舞女，有兩個在互相擁抱着練習跳Ｂlues其餘的只各佔了一張椅位呆坐着。</p>
<p>他倆也揀了兩個客位坐了下來。他覺得那兩個舞女吵得相當的藝術，他特别是鑑賞她們的蹬脚，蹬得滿響亮的，像有一種節凑的音調。於是他告訴了她。</p>
<p>「那是你的鑑賞力太差了。······」</p>
<p>她又笑起來了。她的意思是，中國人大體多是神經衰弱，缺乏鑑賞的能力。但中國的藝術界，丨丨特别是文壇，是因果倒置，個個都先從批評着手。結果不是陷於極端的主觀的挑剔，便是批評者本身的妄自尊大，以爲辱駡了他人的藝術，便可以抬高自己的聲價，實在缺乏涵養的工夫。這種毛病常常在文學中流露出來而不自覺。故欲達到這種涵養的工作，一定要先從鑑賞的工作着手。她勸海泉對於一切藝術，暫緩取主觀的態度，而先取客觀的鑑賞態度，然後才有進境。</p>
<p>但是，海泉還是不大了了，唯有驚異這個日本婦人對於藝術竟有這樣深的研究。</p>
<p>「林先生你跳舞跳得還好吧？」</p>
<p>「不好。」</p>
<p>他爽快地回答了。他從前也曾和同學們到過跳舞塲幾次，但只是拖着雙腿給舞女東拉西扯。他眞怕這個醜態給鶴子夫人看見了。他决意在今晚上只是鑑賞吧。</p>
<p>音樂開奏了。無女和客人也陸陸續續地來了不少。電光每次低暗一番，便多增幾個來客。「林先生，我和你也來一個。」</p>
<p>她拉了拉他的手，但他只是微笑着不回答。</p>
<p>「看她會不會立起身來强拉我，那才表示出她對自己的熱誠。······啊，擁抱她的機會到來了！」</p>
<p>他在這樣希望着。他想，這趟的自己决不是　蝦蟆了吧。</p>
<p>由握手而攬腰，由攬腰而擁抱，由擁抱而，········而·····一級一級的升上去，他想他倆的戀愛恐怕不久也要畢業了。</p>
<p>受着音樂的擁進，他拖着像兩隻硬竹筒般的長腿，一任鶴子夫人東拉西扯了。在這時候，他的感情有些像多喝了半斤遠年花雕，昏昏沉沉的。</p>

<h3 id="c277">如何組織的研究 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>在過去本刋曾發表了許多關於生活苦悶的文字，「店員通訊」内有了幾個組織的芻議，以共同組織來解决共同的苦悶，原是一條正當的道路。我們看到現在華北的情形，處處充滿了無準備無組織的現象，同我們敵人比較起來，適成爲一反比例的形勢，推究其原因，則由於政府組織不健全，人民中則更無組織嚴密的集團，來做政府的後盾，來督促政府改進現狀，於是國難的情况，遂日趨嚴重。我們要想對國家有所盡責，應先要對於組織的問題，有所研究，加以實騐。因爲我們深信有組織始有力量，民衆有組織，民衆始有力量，始可以產生有組織有力量的政府，始可以抵抗有組織的帝國主義者，始可以挽救這空前的國難。</p>
<p>論到「如何組織」這個題目，粗看起來，很覺有反動的危險，其實若以如何團結來解釋，就不成問題了。「團結」是空洞的名詞，牠的實際就是組織，團結是組織的結果；換句話說，組織的結果，就是團結。中國人並不是不團結，乃是因爲没有組織。但是現在的中國，民族精神消沉旣久，團結性尤極度的散漫，我們要一旦把牠發揚起來非有長時間的訓練不可。所以「組織」要有一定的步驟，須按步就班的做去，方能有好的成績。同時也要曉得「組織」的困難，須具十分的耐心和絶大的毅力去幹，方始可以成功。最須革除的是「觀望」的態度，要每個人都能負起責任來。</p>
<p>組織一個團體，扼要一點說，不外乎以下的幾個主要條件：</p>
<p>㈠要有共同的目標　一種組織，如果牠的動機以個人爲出發點，謀少數人的利益，那麽，這個組織的本身，根本就没有意義。所以要成爲一個眞正爲公的有力量的團體組織，必先要確定一個眞正爲公衆謀利益的共同目標，然後依照這共同目標，研究規定進行的計劃，而後行動方可趨於一致，組織的精神纔易於表現。</p>
<p>㈡確定經濟的來源　經濟之重要，誰都知道。很有許多偉大事業，因了經濟不足而功虧一簣的。團體組織，何獨不然。故雖有堅苦卓絶的精神，努力奮鬭的决心，而經濟力量缺乏，至具體計劃難於實行，豈非是一個絶大的致命傷？所以經濟的來源，必須確定，方能减少進行的障碍。</p>
<p>㈢要有中堅的集團　所謂中堅的集團，就是一個團體組織中能負責任的基本會員。每一個基本會員都是感覺到生活之苦悶，現狀之不滿，因而共同聯合成一個組織，對於他組織的本身是有深切的覺悟，利用各個不同的環境，向着共同的目標進行，不躁急，不失望，堅苦卓絶，努力奮鬭。在這過程中，自然會產生出一個卓異的領袖，排除萬難，絶不灰心，能犧牲一己，成就大衆。如俄之列寧，印度之甘地，意大利之莫索里尼，便是這一類的人物。</p>
<p>雖然尙有其他的條件，但是能夠具備了上述三項原則，組織起來也就不難了。不過在現在中國的狀態下，究應如何組織，來改革社會呢？我們現在且提出了一個簡明的步驟，以作參考：</p>
<p>㈠堅定立塲，研究入手的方法：</p>
<p>㈡最初先由少數人負責組織一小團體，赴之以充滿的興味和偉大的毅力，以遠大眼光作長期之準備，爲將來擴大組織時之一部分的基礎：</p>
<p>㈢立定發表計劃的步驟；</p>
<p>㈣公開徵求會員時期；</p>

<h3 id="c278">怎樣使商家過年盡循國歷？ <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>商家過年仍循廢歷問題</p>
<p>廢除舊歷而改用國歷的明令，早經政府頒佈全國，已易幾度寒暑了丨迺多數商家大都視爲具文，不　遵守，就拿文明都市的上海而　，雖有一般銀行　　　　　　　　　　　店，在茲國歷新年，尙能閉户休業，裝出過年的塲面：而其他普通商店，依然開着店門，各做買賣。其實此種未曾過過新年的商店，怎肯放棄其歷久遺傳的過年習慣，而置憇息於弗顧。那末，旣然不過國歷新年，自然是期待着廢歷的　臨，等到希望已達，還是照樣關門大吉，停止營業。</p>
<p>至於我們鄕下，尤其不把國歷當作一回事。無論那家商店，每屆國歷新年，總是如常交易，毫没一點新年的表示。可是一到了廢歷的新年，大家就不約而同地將門緊閉，罷起市來，熟人相遇，輒將雙手高拱，大喊其「恭喜」「發財」的口號！然而試一檢閱他們賬籍，固明明寫的是國歷年月也！一隅若此，他處當難例外。這種驢頭不對馬嘴的怪態，在今日這畸形社會中，成了一個一年有兩個年頭的畸形徵象！</p>
<p>本來國家法令，人民自有絶對服從的義務；而令出法隨，即寓威信於其間，所以國家而法令不行，就是牠的威信掃地！現在這些認國歷爲無足重輕的商家，老是「故步自封」；不將過年舊習，改變過來。這簡直是視法令如弁髦，等威信於無物，而貽國家以「政令不出國門」之譏，致使外人騰笑！似斯不恤國家體面的悖法行爲，非我號稱愛國的商家，所宜出此！以是關於過度新年，應以國歷爲依歸，而有一致奉行之必要！　　考他們所以不肯革故鼎新的理由，無非藉口於有礙年關的收賬。據個中人云：「店中貨物，悉從滬上購採而來，往來盡是記賬。向以廢歷的「端午」「中秋」「年關」三節爲償付期間，尤以年關結束，最稱重要，須得掃數歸還，不許拖欠。而貨物傾銷的地方，則在四鄕，多半係屬賒欠，清算之期，祇有年關一節。若輩鄕人均以年底還賬，目爲牢不可破的定例，必定到了迫近歲闌，才能拿來付給；否則任你討得舌敝唇焦，他都不理。一旦遵了國歷，提早過年；則催索方面，益感棘手，此時收入旣無，何以應付滬上商號？因此對於過年一層，只好仍循廢歷。」這樣看來，他們也何嘗不是狃於相沿的習尙；因而得過且過，不願多事紛更。實則大家果能很齊心地一律起來尊崇國歷，將茲廢歷過年的痕跡，澣濯無餘，那麽，等到國歷年關一到，鄕人自會將他的賬項趕速了理，决無再有推諉不還之理。須知風俗未始不可因人力而轉移，患在不去努力爲之耳！所以目前最緊要的，就是應當用怎樣方法把他們這頑固成見，打得粉碎，庶幾以後過起年來，才有盡趨國歷的希望！</p>
<p>這個問題，關係國家大體，不在小處，爲特將牠提出本刋，用供大衆的討論。海内不乏明達之士，尙乞弗吝珠玉而賜敎之！無任欣幸！</p>

<p>紗廠掃地小工生活</p>
<p>在××紗廠布機間車間裏，車子開着，小姊妹們兩手忙着，小工們也各做着自己的工作。飯桶六十二號，對兩個掃地小工說：</p>
<p>「五十七，一百零八，明天過午到我家裏來，帮我搬家。」</p>
<p>說完就走到旁邊去了。自然，做飯桶的說一句話等於發命令，而並不是請求：因爲是命令，所以並不需要他們的答語的。</p>
<p>五十七和一百零八，抬起頭來相互的看了一下，没有說話，就又低下頭去掃亂線頭了。</p>
<p>六十二號飯桶　　　　　　　　　到那兩個小工身旁。</p>
<p>「我的家知道不，柏祿里××號。」他又向他們說；「搬到××坊二十號。」</p>
<p>告訴完，又走開，但立刻回過頭，又補充兩句：「聽到没有，不要忘記，明天過午去，過午廠裏不要來。」</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>晚上放工時，五十七和一百零八在廠外遇在一處，各人手裏提着一個飯盒子。五十七正想坐小車到楊樹浦橋，看到一百零八，先問一聲：「到那裏去，一百零八？」</p>
<p>「松潘路小菜塲，你到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「好，一塊兒走，我也不坐車了，我到楊樹浦橋，一塊兒走，大家商量商量明天事情。」</p>
<p>「好。」說着，兩個人順着楊樹浦路往東慢慢的走去。</p>
<p>「我說不去。」五十七說。</p>
<p>「我也不想去，幹嗎帮他搬家！」</p>
<p>「就是這樣說。平日他處處壓迫工友們，打，駡，罰錢，他做壞事頂多，是工友大仇人！」</p>
<p>「是大仇人，我說更不帮他搬！」</p>
<p>「不搬！帮走狗搬家可眞是錯認了人。」</p>
<p>「帮寃家仇人搬家，世界上一份也找不到！」</p>
<p>「好，那麽一定不去！」</p>
<p>「一定不去！」</p>
<p>事情商量好。走到楊樹浦橋，五十七往蘭路岔下去，一百零八過橋一直往前走，兩人回頭遠遠望，高高擺着手。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>半天工夫又過去，拉了響氣回聲，××紗廠男女工一齊吃午飯。大家忙忙地吃，過一會回聲再響，一個跟一個又進車間做工。五十七和一百零八，仍然在布機間裏照常工作，但六十二號飯桶却不在。</p>
<p>又過半點鐘。忽然，六十二號飯桶，帶着滿臉怒氣走到那裏。在他每天所坐的位置上坐下，他把五十七同一百零八兩個人呌了去。</p>
<p>「幹嗎你兩個不去！昨天没有聽到我的話麽？耳朶長到你媽的巴子裏去了嗎？」他張口就駡。</p>
<p>兩個人没有出聲。</p>
<p>「去，跟我去，放下掃巴就走！」他發完了命令，抬起屁股要走。</p>
<p>「不去。」兩個人一齊說。</p>
<p>因爲没有走成，飯桶乃大發其威風　　「幹嗎不去？」</p>
<p>「那不是我的事情。」</p>
<p>「我不是到這裏來替人搬家。」</p>
<p>飯桶氣得嘴裏呼呼地作響，一時說不出話來。過了好久，他禁不住的憤憤地說：</p>
<p>「好，滾你們的蛋丨不去就不去，殺豬屠死了難道我會吃帶毛豬不成丨」</p>
<p>他雖是這樣的說，但倒底没有回去搬家，又坐到原來的座位上，眼睛死釘着兩個人做工，看樣子，像一釘就釘進兩個小工的心才消恨。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×　　×</p>
<p>四天過後，五十七和一百零八每人被罰了一塊錢，理由「是做生活揩油」！</p>
<p>自然，單單他們兩個人對付一個飯桶是没有辦法的，但他們是那樣的氣憤，一定要幹一下！</p>
<p>「要幹一下！」</p>
<p>「我有法子！」</p>
<p>過了兩天，眞幹出事來了。全布機間的小工，和小姊妹大家一齊停工，反對六十二號飯桶無理壓迫工人。還不到一點鐘的工夫，寫字間就貼出了如下的一張通告：「六十二號工頭辦事不力，着即停工。」</p>

<p>Not Showing Consideration for Japan and Still Seeking a Final Reconciliation</p>
<p>Discussion of Drafting Recommendations Yielded Little Definite Result</p>
<p>Some Even Advocated Returning it to the Executive Yuan for Handling</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 19-Nation Committee met this morning and decisively decided to refuse discussion of Japan's hastily proposed and untimely new proposal. It is expected that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem will be based on the ten principles in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report. How to obtain the cooperation of the United States and Russia, and how to eliminate obstacles to its implementation after the report is published, will be discussed further next Monday (the 6th). (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the 19-Nation Committee has today refused to discuss Japan's new proposal, it has instructed Secretary-General Drummond to inform the Japanese representative Matsuoka that mediation is still possible if Japan can accept the draft resolution of December. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 19-Member Special Committee convened for two and a half hours starting at 10:30 this morning. The meeting spent an hour studying the Japanese proposal and finally decided that the Japanese proposal was unacceptable. However, it was also decided to inform the Japanese representative Matsuoka that Japan could still accept the December resolution with two amendments, namely: (1) not inviting the United States and Russia to participate, and (2) changing the explanatory statement to a declaration, to which Japan could make reservations. The Special Committee then discussed its recommendations from various points. What was agreed was whether the Special Committee should make a resolution proposal or just a general proposal. The attendees spoke and discussed with each other, but the general opinion seemed to be that the ten points in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report should be the basis of the recommendations. The next meeting of the Special Committee will be held at 10:30 AM on Monday. The report of the 19-Member Special Committee is gradually taking concrete shape, and its recommendations will also crystallize. As for the future, the opinions of the attendees are gradually divided into two factions. One faction advocates submitting the report to both parties to show that the League of Nations General Assembly no longer has a direct relationship with this dispute. This issue must of course be returned to the League of Nations Executive Yuan. The other faction advocates submitting this report to all member states of the League of Nations, and the 19-Member Special Committee or another similar body should remain in existence to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. The reason for this second argument is that, according to the resolution of March 11, the Special Committee has this right in law, because that resolution contains the meaning that the League of Nations General Assembly has the duty to prevent the seizure of land in violation of treaties. The important fact discovered in today's meeting is that the door to mediation is still not closed, and the offer made to Japan on December 15 to accept the draft resolution with two amendments still exists. It is the general opinion that Japan should not be bound by the explanatory statement and can make reservations, so that Tokyo may accept this final offer from the Special Committee. The Special Committee has followed the instructions of Secretary-General Drummond to contact Matsuoka in order to discuss this issue. The Special Committee then discussed the recommendation issue, but the attendees' remarks were quite scattered, and there was no resolution on the course to be taken. Some people agreed that the recommendations should have a practical method for resolving this dispute. As for the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo," it did not seem to be discussed. Regarding China's request to stipulate a deadline, the attendees all believed that this matter should be decided by the League of Nations General Assembly, so it is expected that the General Assembly can be convened in the middle of this month. Some people in the meeting mentioned that sanctions are a natural possibility deduced from the report. This view was not generally supported, but what was generally agreed upon was that the Special Committee's recommendations should be based on the ten points in Section 9 of the Lytton Report. Representatives of small countries expressed strong feelings that the Special Committee's recommendations should condemn Japan's actions in violating the Covenant, but there was still no definite way to discuss this view. The meeting of the 19-Member Special Committee is progressing very slowly, and it seems doubtful whether the report can be completed by Thursday, but it is expected that the drafting issue will still be submitted to the nine-member sub-committee for handling next week, because the sub-committee works more quickly.</p>
<p>Meeting Communiqué: The communiqué issued after the meeting is as follows: The 19-Member Special Committee met today, chaired by Mr. Paul Hymans. The Special Committee received the original text of the first part of the report submitted by the Drafting Committee. The Special Committee can submit this report to the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant in the future. The Special Committee also received a letter from the Chinese government requesting that the procedure be expedited and deciding on the deadline under Article 12 of the Covenant, and received a certain new proposal sent by the Japanese representative. After careful consideration of Japan's new proposal, the Special Committee appreciates the spirit of the Japanese side in making this proposal, but regretfully concludes that the Japanese proposal is fundamentally incompatible with the Special Committee's proposal of December 16, even with the amended proposal to cater to the wishes of the Japanese government, and is still very different, so it cannot be regarded as a satisfactory basis for the mediation procedure under Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant, and in view of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry. The Special Committee requests the Secretary-General to convey this opinion to the Japanese delegation, and explain to it that the only basis on which the Special Committee can have a successful opportunity lies in the Japanese government's acceptance of the Special Committee's proposal of December 16, with the two changes that have already been expressed, namely, deleting the clause that non-member states join the Mediation Committee, and agreeing that both parties have the right to make reservations about the explanatory statement made by the chairman representing the 19-Member Special Committee. The Special Committee also instructed the Secretary-General to explain to the Japanese representative that the mediation procedure under Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant is still valid, until the League of Nations General Assembly passes a report in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4. However, in view of the long period of negotiations, and the Special Committee's many efforts to seek an agreement, it has no choice but to proceed with the drafting of the report at the same time. This work can be completed in a relatively short period of time. As soon as the draft is completed, the League of Nations General Assembly can be convened immediately. The Special Committee has now begun to exchange its views on this report and its recommendations. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Simon Avoids Japan and Reveals Impatience <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Will the Sino-Japanese problem apply Article 15, paragraph 4, or will it return to paragraph 3? At this critical moment, Foreign Minister Simon, who is expected to play an important role, has not yet arrived in Geneva. It seems unlikely that he will leave London before the British Ambassador to the United States returns home. The British side has adopted this evasive attitude at this critical moment, which is quite incomprehensible. According to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems that the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai recently telegraphed the British government, stating that because of Foreign Minister Simon's pro-Japanese attitude, the feelings of Chinese officials and civilians towards Britain have deteriorated, and British companies in China have suffered significant losses, hoping that the government will change its policy towards China. That is, the voices within Britain criticizing the government's pro-Japanese attitude are very high. For this reason, Simon's position is very difficult. Even if Simon returns to Geneva in the future, he may not be able to expect much from his mediation to return to paragraph 3. (Dentsu dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Tsuneo Matsudaira, visited British Foreign Secretary Simon at the British Foreign Office yesterday. It is heard that Simon still expressed his pro-Japanese stance on Japan's demands, and ordered the British representative in Geneva to use delaying tactics to prevent the proceedings from invoking paragraph 4.

<p>Clearly a Japanese Fabrication</p>
<p>The Sino-Russian Commercial Agreement is also a Fiction</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially denied this morning the rumor from Geneva that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Miles Lampson, had made a proposal to the Chinese authorities to hold a round table conference to find a way for China and Japan to directly resolve the dispute, saying that the Ambassador had not discussed this proposal with the Chinese government. The spokesperson also stated that the content of the temporary Sino-Russian commercial agreement rumored by the Japanese side is inaccurate and entirely a Japanese fabrication. As for the round table conference, it was also rumored by the Japanese side. At a time when the League of Nations is about to judge the issue of the Three Northeastern Provinces, the Japanese are deliberately spreading such rumors, which proves that the Japanese are anxious and frustrated because they have heard that the League of Nations Special Committee will prepare a strong report criticizing Japan's illegal activities in the Three Northeastern Provinces.

<p>(Geneva) After deciding to make a final effort, Representative Matsuoka visited League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and British Representative Eden on the 2nd to explain Japan's position. On the 3rd, representatives Matsuoka, Sato, and Nagaoka visited various parties separately to continue negotiations. Matsuoka met with Italian Representative Aloisi, Sato visited Belgian Representative Poul-Quogan, and Nagaoka met with German Representative Keller to explain the following Japanese positions: (1) The Japanese government sincerely hopes to reach a settlement procedure under Article 15, paragraph 3. (2) The Japanese government's instructions have been submitted to Drummond, and it is expected that Drummond will report to the 19-Nation Committee tomorrow. The points that the Japanese government cannot concede will absolutely not be conceded, but it is willing to make concessions on other points. (3) The 19-Nation Committee has resolved to welcome the Japanese government to submit new proposals in order to reach a settlement procedure, so the 19-Nation Committee must consider the Japanese proposal.

<p>Economic Difficulties Will Not Allow it to Withdraw</p>
<p>Urges the Government Not to Adopt a Hesitant Attitude Again</p>
<p>(London) The 19-Nation Committee met in Geneva today to review the draft report on the Manchurian Incident. The "Manchester Guardian," the organ of the British Liberal Party, took this opportunity to once again demand that the British government clearly declare whether it supports the League of Nations' future actions against Japan. The newspaper said that it would be particularly advantageous to intervene resolutely at present, as Japan's attitude, although very strong so far, has already shown signs of hesitation at this time. It is said that, "Japan initially declared that if the Extraordinary Assembly included conclusions regarding the Manchurian issue in the report, or if these conclusions criticized Japan too harshly, Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations. At this moment, Japan seems to only want to issue a statement, with a warning attached, that if the Assembly's resolution is unfavorable to Japan, a movement to withdraw from the League of Nations will inevitably occur in Japan." The newspaper then concluded that Japan is encountering major difficulties in internal affairs and finance, and will never leave the League of Nations to isolate itself from the rest of the world. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian editorial today discussed the Manchurian issue, saying that Japanese soldiers are now inflicting blows on China again, directly telling the League of Nations that it will do what it wants, and that no one can do anything about it. China is becoming increasingly impatient with the League of Nations' delays, believing that the League of Nations does not want to do anything to uphold its own principles and support the weak and suppress the strong. The newspaper also said that at the very least, what the League of Nations can do is to decide whether the League of Nations Covenant has been violated, and by whom, and declare that the League of Nations cannot recognize the situation created by the aggressor's violation of the Covenant. If the League of Nations does not act clearly, Japan can act arbitrarily, and the Covenant will become a waste of paper, without any doubt. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In view of the very serious current international political situation, the National Federation of University Professors held a committee meeting at the Tokyo Industry Club on the 3rd and passed a resolution: (1) When the League of Nations Committee members do not understand Japanese affairs and apply paragraph 4 of the Covenant, Japan should resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations. (2) When Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will inevitably be subjected to considerable pressure from various countries, so it should rush to unify national opinion and urge the awakening of Eastern countries in order to establish peace in the Far East. (3) The important issues at present are the student ideology problem and the economic problem, so a research committee will be specially established to study countermeasures.

The puppet Fengshan Railway and Datong Railway have completely suspended passenger cars and are busy transporting troops and military supplies. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to information from a certain country's consulate in Shenyang, from the 2nd to the 3rd, there were 19 Japanese military trains traveling from Shenyang to Jinzhou, carrying a total of 11,400 Japanese soldiers, who will launch a large-scale invasion of Jehol within days.

<p>Linyu: The remnants of the Japanese 8th, 10th, and 14th Divisions seem to have arrived in Shenyang from Japan and Korea and are being deployed to the Jin-Sui-Yu area. The puppet Fengshan Railway has suspended all passenger cars on the entire line from the 3rd to allow for the aforementioned transportation. According to today's news, the rumor that Japan is further increasing troops in the Yu Pass area is true. On the 3rd, a small unit of more than one hundred people arrived in Yu Pass as the advance party and is stationed at the county-run primary school in the city. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to traffic circles, the enemy army is using Jinzhou as a base, and large quantities of ammunition and food are being transported and stored there. They are also forcing farmers to build highways directly connecting to Jehol, running in more than ten directions. The puppet state is forcing a local gentleman named Yang to serve as the county magistrate of Linyu, while also following the wishes of the Japanese. At present, there are less than a thousand Japanese soldiers in Yu Pass. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

Observing the initial victory, we know that the perseverance of the re-engagement will be even greater. The declaration has spread, inspiring all souls, and the prestige has spread, admired by all.

Zhu and Mao, elusive as they are, retreated to Zixi, Lichuan, Guangchang, Jianning, Ninghua, and Kangdu, and then concentrated in a few points, attempting to take advantage of our unpreparedness and sneak out of Kangdu and Xiaoshi to attack Nancheng. The divisions of Tao Yuezhe, Xu Kexiang, and Zhou Zhirou, relying on fortifications, are waiting for the enemy and launching a head-on attack, and the various units advancing to Jinxi are also launching fierce attacks on the bandits, but no news of victory has been received in the province. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) A person from the front line described the situation of the bandits retreating to Fujian: 1. The pseudo-22nd Army, 64th Division, is circling Xiaoshi, and the 65th and 66th Divisions are circling Dazhu, taking the route of Lichuan and Guangchang, and entering western Fujian. The pseudo-Fifth Army is also retreating along this route. The pseudo-132nd Army is retreating to northern Fujian via Shangqing Gorge and Xia Shan, with most of them reaching Mengguan and Guangze. Because of too many deaths, the pseudo-Military Commission ordered the various guerrilla teams to be incorporated into the Red Army and captured farmers to replenish them, attempting to circle out of Lichuan again to the side of Nancheng, but the Jiangxi and Fujian armies have already surrounded the bandits.

<p>(Nanjing) The Joint Association of Journalists from Shanghai Newspapers Stationed in Beijing and the Capital Journalists Association submitted a petition to the Central Propaganda Committee and military and police agencies on the 4th, stating that the matter was to appeal for justice to console the departed soul. Wang Weisan, a member of our association and a Beijing reporter for the Shanghai Shishi News, was lured into a car by two strangers wearing blue cloth gowns at the National Private Commercial Association on Dashi Dam Street in Beijing at noon on the 31st of this month and driven away quickly. Then, at about 5 p.m. on the same day, a report was received that Wang had been shot dead outside Zhongshanmen Sifangcheng. Members of our association were deeply saddened upon hearing the news. The deceased had served in the press for many years, was honest and upright, and was very amiable in his dealings with people. This assassination was truly shocking. It is believed that the capital is heavily guarded by military and police, and the scene of the incident is not an overly remote area, yet the murderer dared to commit this heinous act in broad daylight, completely disregarding the law. This matter concerns the public security of Beijing and should be reported to you to order a swift investigation into the truth of this case, strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice, in order to seek justice and comfort the departed soul.

<h3 id="e45">Gu Zhutong's Execution of Liu Yusheng Case, Guangzhou <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Last year in July, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, under the pretext of being reactionary, illegally arrested Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, and detained him for a long period of time. On January 11th, he sentenced Liu to death and closed down the Jiangsheng Daily. This case was brought to light nationwide through the impeachment of Supervisory Committee members Liu Eqing and others. It has now become a major issue of common concern to the people of the country.</p>
<p>According to the charges against Liu Yusheng announced by Gu, the text contained in the newspaper's supplement contained reactionary suspicions and advocated class struggle. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's presentation to the Executive Yuan, in addition to the reactionary nature of the text in the supplement, Liu had also organized an illegal trade union in January of the 16th year of the Republic, inciting rickshaw pullers to strike. It also stated that the Publication Law was applied to control the newspaper and the Martial Law Regulations were applied to try the criminals. The Martial Law Command has the power to handle matters in the martial law area. The execution of Liu Yusheng was based on legal grounds and should not be blamed in terms of ordinary legal principles and peacetime conditions. The arguments and defenses he cited were indeed well-founded. However, according to the report of Supervisory Committee member Liu Eqing and others, the articles published in the newspaper's supplement were merely works describing the state of our social life, so the most important evidence of Liu's crime cannot be established. If Liu had organized an illegal trade union in the 16th year of the Republic as another evidence of his crime, then such old accounts would probably be countless. Many of the people who actually led politics in the 16th year of the Republic are still central leaders today. Since the evidence of Liu's crime is not sufficient, the cited Publication Law and Martial Law Regulations have fundamentally lost their basis. It is indeed a case of "if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext."</p>
<p>It is stipulated that the people should enjoy freedom of speech and publication, with clear guarantees in the Kuomintang party platform and in the provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage. Gu's execution of Liu Yusheng this time is tantamount to directly trampling on human rights and indirectly abandoning the Kuomintang party platform and the provisional constitution. The significance of this case is self-evident. In the current situation we are in, apart from urgently demanding that the government maintain the spirit of the rule of law and the dignity of the law, and hold responsible personnel accountable according to the law, what else can we say? If the government ignores this, those who follow Liu's case will probably not be lacking in the future. People's lives are not guaranteed at all, and how can people not be chilled by this?</p>
<p>The duty of a journalist is to speak for the people's suffering and to convey fair public opinion. If this sacred duty is not guaranteed, then our public opinion circles cannot exist in the world for a single day. Moreover, this phenomenon is not tolerated by the civilized countries of the world today. Therefore, in order to protect human rights, in order to maintain the legal system and consolidate the authority of the Central Government, we very much hope that the government will deal with this matter fairly and appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Japanese Aviation Fever Reaches Its Peak <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Actively Developing the Air Force to Prepare for World War</p>
<p>Army and Navy Claim to be Sufficiently Able to Cope</p>
<p>Dalian Japanese Police Organize Aviation Patrol Team</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministers of the Army and Navy have made a clear statement to the House of Peers, stating that the Japanese Army and Navy are well prepared for air defense and are actively developing the Air Force, so there is no need to establish a separate Air Force. This statement was made in response to a question raised by Mizuno, a member of the Seiyukai Yūhō Club. Mizuno claimed that Soviet Russia has recently changed its five-year plan and is actively replenishing its national defense, as if it were aimed at Japan. Japan's air force capabilities are not up to the needs of the country, so it is necessary to establish a separate Ministry of Aviation. Mizuno also cited the example of Zhang Xueliang, who had 500 aircraft, but due to a lack of trained pilots, he stored the aircraft in warehouses. Therefore, if an unexpected event occurs in Japan, will it also fall into the same predicament? Mizuno also made alarming remarks, saying that Matsuoka is engaged in "making the world recognize Japan's position." If he cannot succeed, then Japan must prepare for a struggle for its own survival. This crisis is becoming increasingly serious, so the people should understand the current reality, and so on.</p>
<p>Army Minister Araki replied that Japan had not formally participated in the European War before, so all weapons of war were not as advanced as those of the great powers, and the development of the Air Force was thus delayed. However, the current Japanese aviation fever has reached its peak, and he pointed out that the military budget had allocated part of the funds for the Youth Flying Corps, in order to make the youth of the country interested in aviation. He believes that even if an air battle occurs, the people can defend themselves, and so on.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi declared that the Navy is doing its utmost to promote aviation. He acknowledged Mizuno's claim that Japan's air defense capabilities are very weak, but it must be known that Japan is prepared to deal with any crisis. As for the Navy, it seeks to achieve the greatest effectiveness with the least consumption, and to compare itself with the great powers. As for the separate establishment of the Ministry of Aviation, Navy Minister Osumi believes that it is not necessary and would be harmful rather than beneficial. This issue has been studied, and even the United States has discussed this issue in detail, but it has been found that this matter cannot be implemented. Navy Minister Osumi finally said that the Ministry of the Navy has worked together to promote the Air Force, and the first batch of youth aviation students will graduate, and so on.

<p>(Dalian) The police here will organize an aviation patrol team in the near future, as two Moth reconnaissance aircraft have been ordered from London, one of which will be delivered soon.

The team's greatest task is to report the traces of the Volunteer Army, and so on. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>US Decides to Build Major Naval Base on Pacific Coast</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reports that the US Atlantic reconnaissance fleet will continue to dock on the Pacific coast after the 1932 naval exercises. It is currently participating in the Honolulu attack and defense exercises. The US Navy Department is building a major naval base near San Pedro to accommodate the entire US Navy. It has instructed Rear Admiral Taikaisheng and Lieutenant Commander John to investigate the Pacific coast and select suitable locations. At the same time, Admiral Li, commander of the entire fleet, has advised that it is necessary to immediately build a major naval base on the Pacific coast in order to prevent the outbreak of war and ensure national defense. Recently, the US government and public have been greatly disturbed by the news that the Japanese navy will hold naval exercises in the South Sea Islands, which are mandated territories. Japan's naval exercises in the South Seas and the US naval exercises centered on Honolulu have a sense of tension, and the American people are very uneasy about the actions and public opinion of the Japanese navy.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that the Port of San Pedro has been approved by the parliament for a major expansion. Although the Port of South San Diego on the Pacific coast can accommodate torpedo boats and submarines, it cannot accommodate a large number of large ships. Although San Francisco has the capacity to accommodate ships, it is not as strategically important as San Pedro. The US naval authorities have begun planning breakwaters and other equipment. With the situation in the Far East tense, the parliament has approved the plan.</p>

<p>Araki Announces Plan to Increase Troops in Northeast to Parliament</p>
<p>Expanding Tank Force and Intensifying Training of Military Dogs and Pigeons</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a spokesman for the Army Ministry, when speaking to a Reuters reporter today about the recent remarks made by Army Minister Araki in parliament, a final decision has not yet been made regarding the commencement of the attack on Rehe, but the hope for a peaceful resolution has been exhausted. The Kwantung Army is currently engaged in the necessary preparations for the attack on Rehe. Due to military reasons, the spokesman declined to give a definite answer as to whether the war will extend to the Beijing-Tianjin area, saying that when the Kwantung Army drafts war strategies, it is deeply aware of the need to avoid endangering the lives and property of foreigners in North China. When asked whether Japan would continue to send reinforcements if the attack on Rehe began, the spokesman replied that he hoped that no reinforcements would be needed, but that preparations were being made to send them if necessary. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Fierce fighting is taking place on the border of Rehe every day, but the main forces of both sides have not yet made contact. According to military sources, the general offensive on Rehe will be launched after the League of Nations issues a notification of its use of Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, because the movement of reinforcements has not been completed and the impact on the League of Nations is significant. At present, Rehe is constantly being bombed by aircraft to disrupt our military positions. (China United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Araki said this afternoon at a subcommittee meeting on the budget in the Lower House that the Japanese Army Ministry believes that the troop strength stationed in Manchuria is insufficient and will be supplemented this year. He will discuss the current troop strength in Manchuria in a closed session. He then said that the Japanese Army Ministry has decided to extend the years of service in the military in order to increase the standing army by one-third, and to expand the tank force. It is planned to complete two tank regiments this year, with an expenditure of 50,000 yuan. For the breeding of military dogs, it is planned to purchase 300 military dogs from a certain European country after the budget is approved and hand them over to the Chiba Infantry School for training. 300 military dogs and 300 military pigeons will be newly dispatched to the Independent Garrison Unit stationed in the three eastern provinces for use on the front line.

<p>(Harbin) A frustrated kidnapping case recently occurred here, and the details have just been released. It is now believed that the case was committed by the same gang that previously kidnapped Florence. This time, the targets of the bandits were Mr. and Mrs. Luo Yicheng. Mr. Luo is a partner of Mr. Kaufman, a wealthy merchant who disappeared after being kidnapped on March 9, 1932. Two bandits captured Mr. and Mrs. Luo, and another bandit used a heavy object to hit Luo's bodyguard, a Russian named Korytniev, causing him to lose consciousness. The two bandits wrestled with Mr. and Mrs. Luo, trying to cover their faces with medicated cloths to make them lose consciousness, but Mrs. Luo became unconscious due to the effects of the medicine, while Mr. Luo was strong and knocked one of the bandits down, pressing the bandit's head against the stone steps. The remaining two bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, fired shots into the air to warn their accomplices waiting in a car at the head of the street. Thereupon, all the bandits scattered. Although Mrs. Luo was unconscious from the medicine, she was not injured at all. Mr. Luo and his Russian bodyguard both suffered serious injuries and have been hospitalized for treatment.

<p>US Opposes British Proposals</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th - The New York Times reported today that when Roosevelt met with British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay on January 29, he told the ambassador that both the United States and Britain should remain silent about the war debt issue for the time being. The report also said that recent discussions by key figures in London and articles in newspapers have aroused opposition among US congressmen and the public to British proposals. It is now believed that Roosevelt told Lindsay about the procedures for war debt negotiations, that is, Roosevelt's first step would be to accept Britain's application and suggestions to modify the war debt based on its ability to repay, and would seem to approve it; the second step would be to accept convincing statistical reasons for reducing this debt, at which time the United States would be prepared and the opinions of Congress would be clear. Then, Roosevelt will send a special reply to the British government, and it is hoped that economic representatives can discuss issues related to war debts, such as tax rates, so that Roosevelt can propose a suspension of payments pending the convening of the World Economic Conference.</p>

<p>French Press Advocates Withdrawal from Conference</p>
<p>British Representative Urges Concrete Discussions</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 3rd - The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference discussed the French disarmament and security plan today. British representative Eden strongly criticized France's security demands, saying that excessive demands for security are tantamount to forgetting the existing guarantees, such as those provided by the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Locarno Treaty. Britain's participation in the Disarmament Conference cannot exceed the scope of the security plan provided by the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty. He concluded that the main task of the Disarmament Conference is to gather various disarmament proposals and standardize them. Fortunately, Czech Foreign Minister Piniès came to the rescue of the French plan, which was criticized by representatives of the major powers. Piniès praised the French plan, saying that agreements on territorial division and mutual assistance are the only way to protect small countries from invasion. The Belgian representative also praised the French plan, but said that it should be improved by incorporating the advantages of other plans. The meeting then announced an adjournment until Monday.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 3rd - After France presented its disarmament and security plan at the first day of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva, the situation in Geneva was very cold, so the French press also felt very disappointed, fearing that the plan proposed by France would soon fail and be replaced by a British proposal. Bertina, the editor of the Paris Echo, said that Britain, Germany, the United States, and Italy will unite into one front and confront isolated France, so that France has no other way but to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. The Paris Daily criticized the speech of German representative Nadolny, but did not publish the original text of Nadolny's speech. The Secretary of the Interior, Loti, published an article in a certain newspaper advocating the redistribution of overseas colonies to satisfy Germany and Italy. Furthermore, former Prime Minister Herriot declared that the efforts to improve relations between France and Italy were completely unsuccessful. This statement was highly valued by all newspapers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 3rd - At a meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the Disarmament Conference today, British representative and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden made a statement, advocating that the Disarmament Conference have concrete results and consider various disarmament plans as soon as possible, saying that the British disarmament proposal was distributed to major countries on January 27, and the Disarmament Conference should immediately begin its work of integrating all data. As a member of the League of Nations and a signatory to the Locarno Treaty, Britain has moved forward to the best of its ability. Britain cannot accept new obligations that are not approved by the British people. What Britain wants to see is the beginning of real disarmament, so that armaments can be gradually reduced. Today, the burden of taxation has made disarmament imperative. The current security plan, which is guaranteed by existing treaties, is enough to enable the world to implement a real disarmament plan. In his view, the disarmament of Europe is a powerful guarantee of European peace. The British proposal aims to proceed simultaneously on the political and technical aspects of the disarmament issue, advocating that European countries should not resort to force, and that if they are invaded without cause, they should assist each other, and also advocating the conclusion of a new treaty to replace Chapter V of the Treaty of Versailles, so that former enemy countries can have equal status. The second part of the British proposal mentions actual disarmament, such as President Hoover's suggestion, advocating reducing the army to the lowest possible level, based on a country's population, for police use. Britain also advocates organizing a National Aviation Committee to study proposals to abolish fighter jets and manage civilian aircraft. The British proposal on the navy only advocates the continuation of qualitative disarmament, such as limiting the caliber of cannons and the tonnage of warships.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 4th - The full powers representatives and other appointments and removals of the army at the Disarmament Conference were officially announced today as follows: Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu will be appointed as the plenipotentiary for the Geneva General Disarmament Conference; Lieutenant General Matsui Iwane will be dismissed from the same position; Major General Morita Yoshi will be appointed as an aide to the same committee member; Kobayashi Shunichiro, entrusted to the Ministry of the Army, will be dismissed from the same position; Major General Morita Yoshi will be appointed as the imperial army representative of the Standing Advisory Committee on Land, Sea, and Air Force Issues of the League of Nations; Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu will be dismissed from the same position;</p>

<p>Socialist Cabinet Members Resign Suddenly</p>
<p>Major Consequences Feared</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 4th - Overnight, a cabinet crisis suddenly broke out in Spain, because Premier Azana and Lerroux clashed. Lerroux criticized the premier for being too inclined towards the Socialist Party, so the two Socialist cabinet members resigned, stating that they did not want to cling to their positions to avoid hindering the restoration of all middle-class Republican factions. Political circles here now believe that this unexpected cabinet crisis may have major consequences. Radical Party leader Lerroux had pointed out that the government was eager to unite with the Socialist Party and grant it political power, without first relying on purely Republican talents to consolidate the Republican government, which was a big mistake. He also severely criticized the current methods of relying on authority, which were too clumsy, believing that frequent prohibitions on newspaper publications and other dictatorial resolutions were merely evidence of the government's weakness. Under the current circumstances, if a cabinet crisis does not occur, a presidential crisis may be triggered. As soon as Lerroux made these remarks, there was a great uproar in the parliament, which was temporarily adjourned. When the parliament reconvened, Premier Azana declared that the situation had not changed, and the cabinet believed that the cooperation of the Socialist Party was indispensable. Lerroux had previously defended the anarchist and groupist factions and opposed legitimate trade unions with representatives in the government, so today's remarks were malicious and disloyal. The cabinet is stronger than ever and has no intention of resigning. As for the conflict between the cabinet and the president, it is also not a problem. After the premier made this statement, everyone said that a storm had subsided. Unexpectedly, the Socialist cabinet members resigned because of this.</p>

<p>Socialist Party Manipulates the Political Situation</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 3rd - The Chamber of Deputies today passed a vote of confidence in the Daladier government by 380 votes to 200 votes. After listening to the cabinet's policy statement, the Socialist Party immediately voted in favor.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 4th - Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies passed the motion of confidence in the government proposed by former Premier Herriot by a majority of 376 votes to 181 votes, rather than 370 votes to 200 votes. However, after the cabinet's declaration was read, followed by questions, the government gained a majority of votes of confidence. The Socialist Party, although voting for confidence, did not welcome it warmly. The move by former Premier Herriot to help the cabinet has made a strong impression. After the meeting, there was much commentary, saying that Herriot had promoted the idea of a centralized cabinet. Herriot's advocacy of a majority party of democrats with the widest possible range was sympathetic to the centrists, but the leftists considered it strange and expressed opposition. Premier Daladier declared that he would submit the financial plan to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion on Tuesday, hoping that the majority party would continue to support it.</p>

<p>Hindenburg Suppresses Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 4th - President Hindenburg has signed an order today restricting freedom of speech in newspapers. The contents have not yet been published. It is said that its main points are the same as those promulgated during the Papen cabinet era. This order was revoked after Schleicher formed a cabinet.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 3rd - According to previous reports, the government was considering issuing a severe emergency order as soon as possible to crack down on political transgressions in order to strictly curb the terrorism of the Communist Party. Today, the local daily newspaper reported that the government may decide to use the order drafted by the former Schleicher cabinet and awaiting promulgation. The authorities now intend to set March 5 as the day for a major housecleaning, the day of the general election. Various provinces will also hold as many elections as possible. It is estimated that several free states will elect new parliaments. It is also heard that Prussia will hold municipal elections on March 12. It was previously rumored that Prussia would be dissolved, but this motion must rely on the support of the Communist Party before it can be passed. Now, because of rumors from outside that the Communist Party may vote against it to make things difficult for the government, it is feared that it may not be implemented. The National Socialist Party has now changed its original proposal to dissolve the parliament immediately and advocated dissolving it on March 4, so that members can use their free train passes to campaign for the general election. The Social Democratic Party issued an election manifesto today, advocating the internationalization of large estates and large industries, and the implementation of the Socialist Party's economic plan. The party's organ, Forward, was ordered by the authorities to cease publication for three days because it published this article. According to estimates in political circles, nearly 45 million Germans will be eligible to vote on March 5, about 500,000 more than in the last election in November last year.</p>

According to Prime Minister Vanda, the government now needs this authority to seriously suppress the disturbances of the Communist Party. However, the majority of members of parliament do not approve of this proposal, considering it to be the first step towards implementing a military dictatorship.</p>

<p>Most Important People Cannot Enter the Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd - When Roosevelt was elected President, the people harbored a kind of fantasy, believing that outstanding talents such as Young, Baruch, Lees, Davis, Baker, and Tralle would all join the cabinet. If any three of the aforementioned individuals were to take on three key positions, the new cabinet would present a unique atmosphere. However, according to current news, the possibility of their entering the cabinet is gradually diminishing. The difficulties felt by the previous president are now also felt by Mr. Roosevelt. The great figures of a country each have good reasons why they cannot hold cabinet positions, whether due to business or health, they cannot devote themselves to public service. Moreover, three of the aforementioned six people reside in New York. Mr. Roosevelt has already chosen his campaign director, Farley, to be the Postmaster General of the new cabinet. Farley is from New York, so Mr. Roosevelt can only choose one more person from New York to enter the cabinet. Furthermore, the decline in business is one reason why Mr. Roosevelt cannot freely choose people. People in the business world, in the current situation, feel that their own businesses require their constant attention. The banking world cannot leave banking for other pursuits, as Young is a case in point. For business reasons, Young cannot sacrifice the next four years in Washington politics. However, Young may accept a temporary appointment to handle negotiations regarding war debts. It is heard that Mr. Tralle cannot separate himself from banking either. If Mr. Roosevelt recruits Baker into the cabinet, he will inevitably break with publishing magnate Hearst, who did his best to help Mr. Roosevelt during the general election, wanting to avoid Baker being rejected as a presidential candidate. It is heard that Mr. Roosevelt intends to appoint New York lawyer Perkins as Secretary of Labor, opening a new era of women entering the cabinet. If Ms. Perkins and Farley are both cabinet members, then Mr. Roosevelt may not further woo other New Yorkers into the cabinet. Therefore, Davis and Baruch will both be unable to be listed on the cabinet member list, as both of them reside in New York.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 4th - According to a reporter from the Daily Telegraph stationed in Hot Springs, the future organization of the Roosevelt government is currently being measured from unofficial sources. The Secretary of State will be Senator Hull of Tennessee, the Secretary of the Treasury will be Senator Glass of Virginia, the Postmaster General will be Farley, and the Secretary of Labor will be Ms. Perkins. Ms. Perkins was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1882 and is particularly qualified for the position of Secretary of Labor. Her sociological writings are quite reputable in the United States. Since 1910, she has held important positions in various industries. Mr. Roosevelt left Hot Springs by yacht last night but is still communicating with Miami City via wireless telephone and transmitting news to newspapers daily. Before setting sail, Mr. Roosevelt declared that the list of cabinet members would be announced on March 2nd and that he intended to convene a special session of Congress to balance the budget and adopt necessary resolutions on various issues that the Republican administration had slightly neglected or handed over for pending action.</p>

<p>Hoover Strongly Advocates Reforming the System</p>
<p>National News, Washington, 3rd - Today, U.S. President Hoover gave a speech at the annual meeting of the American Legislators Association, urging reform of the national taxation system, eliminating overlapping taxation agencies to reduce waste and enrich the national treasury. This speech by Hoover is generally regarded as his last speech on economic matters during his term. It is said that at present, the U.S. federal government and various states, counties, and cities each have their own taxation systems, which are not connected. Even the budget plans, financial plans, and tax rates of each state are not reported to the federal government. Often, the federal government's taxation plans have already been implemented by various states, resulting in overlapping and substantial losses. Therefore, it is suggested that the states and the federal government should cooperate with each other to solve this problem scientifically. Currently, some towns often have four taxation agencies, which results in a significant loss in the efficiency of taxation. If these can be reorganized, waste can be greatly reduced and efficiency can be greatly increased.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Famous European Volcano Erupts <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 3rd - The famous Mount Vesuvius has now become active again. Shaking stones are shooting into the air, as dense as rain. Onlookers are all shocked and terrified, and earthquakes are rumbling. Residents in the surrounding area all fled their homes yesterday and camped out in the fields. So far, no losses have occurred. However, Professor Malaterra, director of the Vesuvius Observatory, has issued a serious warning, saying that the current intense eruption seems to be temporary, but the center of the volcano clearly has the brewing of a fierce eruption, which will reach the point of explosion sometime this spring. The professor also said that the vent of the current volcano is gradually shrinking. If it continues to shrink, then it may erupt a new vent as in 1929. In that year, the volcano's molten vent destroyed an entire town. The professor also predicted that this year's eruption will be far more intense than usual. It is found that the volcano has never been completely silent since the major eruption on August 24, 79 AD. Since then, it has erupted periodically. In 472 and 1631, the hot ash and gravel fell directly to Constantinople. In 51, it even reached Tripoli in Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Issue of a Japanese-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty (Tokyo Dispatch) <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Opinions of Supporters Deserve Attention</p>
<p>Since Japan's invasion of the three northeastern provinces, the war clouds over the Pacific have remained dense for a year. Japan is suffering from domestic economic panic and fearing the threats of Russian and American power. Manchuria, a piece of flesh, is likely to be difficult to swallow safely. Therefore, for half a year, the atmosphere of Japan and Russia concluding a non-aggression treaty has been propagated in the government and among the people, but the actual occurrence has been slow in coming. According to the conversation between Foreign Minister Uchida and newspaper reporters, although it is said that the borders of Japan, Russia, and Manchuria are intertwined and disputes can occur at any time, if a Japanese-Russian-Manchurian tripartite committee is established, it can be adjusted accordingly. Regarding the issue of this committee, representatives of the Russian and Japanese consulates in Harbin are discussing it accordingly. Once the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to Russia arrives in Moscow, the Russian and Japanese governments can begin formal negotiations on this matter. However, recently, small red and white leaflets have been discovered, printed in Russian and Japanese, demanding severance of relations with Soviet Russia. From this, it can also be seen that the Japanese people have a deep aversion to Russia, and the talk of a treaty may be difficult to achieve in practice.</p>
<p>However, Japanese people have extremely inconsistent views on the issue of Japan and Russia concluding a non-aggression treaty. Some are extremely opposed to concluding, while others are trying their best to support it. Here are the opinions of various parties on this issue, as reported here, summarized as follows: Some people say that Soviet Russia is communist, and Japan is a capitalist country. In terms of the national essence (the foundation of the country), Japan and Russia have absolutely no possibility of cooperation, and they should not cooperate. Furthermore, based on this viewpoint, Japan must attack Soviet Russia because Japan is taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use Manchuria as a foothold to erect the banner of eliminating the proletarian dictatorship of the communist country. On the one hand, it can win the sympathy of capitalist powers such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany, and at the same time, it can make the "Manchukuo" obtain world recognition, overcome the League of Nations, overcome China, and easily "finish" the Manchurian issue. On the other hand, since the revolution, Soviet Russia has been painstakingly engaged in domestic economic construction, making great efforts of blood and flesh. Now, the five-year plan is yet to be completed, and the manufacture of domestic armaments has not yet reached perfection. Therefore, its diplomatic policy in recent years has reversed its previous revolutionary and tough diplomacy, and has quickly shifted to peaceful diplomacy. It can be seen that what Soviet Russia needs most today is to ease diplomatic relations, be honest and friendly, and work hard to build national strength. If Japan does not take advantage of a quick victory, it is feared that the strength of the Soviet Union will gradually expand in the future, and there will be an irreversible situation.</p>
<p>Among the members of the Seiyukai, internal opinions on the matter of Japan and the Soviet Union concluding a non-aggression treaty are also very different. The Japanese Foreign Ministry itself also has its own arguments on this matter, and they do not agree with each other. Supporters mostly say that the closer the relationship between Japan and Russia, the greater the benefits Japan can obtain. Opponents use the spread of communist ideology to Japan as an excuse. However, both sides currently have no good feelings towards Soviet Russia because Moscow published documents on this matter without paying attention to Japan's request not to publish it temporarily, and the Japanese Foreign Minister believes that there are insulting words in the note from the Russian ambassador to Japan.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another school of thought that is most peculiar and can be called the fence-sitters because they acknowledge the benefits of concluding a treaty on the one hand, and fear the spread of communist ideology in the country on the other. Therefore, the conclusion of this school of thought is that it is beneficial for us (referring to Japan) to conclude a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, but unfortunately, the timing is not yet ripe and still needs to wait.</p>
<p>Finally, we will elaborate on the arguments of the supporters who promote the most and are proud of their clear views.</p>
<p>The supporters say that the existence of "Manchukuo" is an ironclad fact. However, the Manchurian issue has not yet reached the time for resolution internationally. Regardless of how the Manchurian issue will be resolved in the future, it is undoubtedly a critical juncture for the survival and prosperity of the Japanese nation. Therefore, when this issue is about to be resolved, the entire Japanese nation must exert all its strength. Studying the issue of concluding a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty from this point of view, especially at a time when diplomacy is in isolation, Japan cannot but express its support in order to extricate itself. Moreover, the conclusion of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty has greater positive benefits for Japan, not just easing diplomacy. Indirectly, it can give Soviet Russia the opportunity to change direction. Directly, first, it can win over Soviet Russia to recognize "Manchukuo," and then the three countries of Japan, Manchuria, and Russia can cooperate with each other to continue to struggle in the international political situation for a long time. Second, obtaining Soviet Russia from outside the League of Nations circle can shift the international political situation in a way that is beneficial to Japan. Third, it can reduce the pressure from the United States on Japan. Fourth, it can make China's policy of alliance with Russia to contain Japan fall through. Ninth, trading with Soviet Russia can mutually benefit and increase economic benefits. Sixth, in the event of war between Japan and the United States, our country can also use this to shorten the defense line. After the conclusion of the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, the benefits obtained by Japan, although the supporters also have a lot of debate and disagreement, can mostly be included in the above points. Regarding the reasons for these points, some are very obvious and easy to understand and do not require explanation, while others require a little simple explanation. We may as well elaborate again. First, make Soviet Russia change direction. The reason held by Japanese war-against-Russia proponents is undoubtedly to prevent and contain the expansion of Soviet Russia's southward policy. Of course, going south is Russia's traditional policy, and it is true to say that Soviet Russia has not abandoned this attempt. However, Soviet Russia's southward expansion is not necessarily limited to the Far East. Supporters of the Japan-Russia treaty advocate that only the conclusion of a Japan-Russia non-aggression treaty is the driving force for making Soviet Russia change its policy to the West. The turning of Soviet Russia's policy to the East was still a relatively late matter, that is, after the Russo-Turkish War. Its previous southward policy was towards the Balkans and Central Asia. Later, due to the obstruction of Britain, France, and Germany, Soviet Russia turned its policy to the East, where the pressure was weak. This was the beginning of Soviet Russia's southward policy turning to the Far East. Subsequently, Britain, Germany, and France each took their own interests and encouraged Soviet Russia to maintain this diplomatic policy. However, since Soviet Russia changed its policy to the Far East, it has become opposed to Japan. Since the imperial government was overthrown and the revolutionary government came to power, it has turned its diplomatic activities, which used to be based in Europe, to the East. As a result, it has now clashed with Japan's iron wall once again (the Northeast Incident). Now, Soviet Russia has a southward trend in Central Asia, and railways are being built rapidly in the Caucasus, and economic progress is also being made step by step. On the other hand, the railway from Novosibirsk to Tashkent, crossing the Pamir Plateau, can go straight to India southward. Supporters say that the conclusion of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty can make Russia's policy focus on these two aspects and abandon its attempt to go south in the Far East. At present, there are various difficulties in Soviet Russia's internal affairs, which is its weakness, so it has to try its best to avoid war, and whether it is temporary or expedient, it will always propose to me to conclude a non-aggression treaty. In the current international political situation, if Japan can obtain an absolutely favorable solution to the Manchurian issue, Japan's future development can be predicted. If there is any mistake in the solution to this issue, it goes without saying that the development on the mainland will be frustrated, and there is a risk of causing a domestic crisis in Japan. Moreover, at this moment, Soviet Russia's recognition of "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia's other assistance to Japan are related to the solution of the Manchurian issue internationally. Now that Soviet Russia is proposing to me to conclude a non-aggression treaty because of internal difficulties, if we do not make good use of this good opportunity, I really do not understand how we can do well afterwards.

<h3 id="e80">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Limits Three Months to Eliminate Communist Bandits in Jiangxi <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Bandit Troops Have Abandoned Eastern Jiangxi and Retreated to the Fujian Border</p>
<p>Jiangxi People Visit Chiang Kai-shek to Express Assistance in Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits is indeed with full determination. Therefore, on the second day of arriving in Jiangxi, he gave a speech at the expanded memorial week meeting of the provincial party headquarters, stating that "The success or failure of this bandit suppression is related to the survival of the country and is also a touchstone for whether our nation can defend and strengthen itself. If the Jiangxi Red Bandits are not cleared, it is the responsibility of the government and myself, and it is also the shame of the people of Jiangxi. The requirements for suppressing the Red Bandits are, first, to be determined to have bandits or have me, and have me or have no bandits. Second, all party, government, and military agencies must be realistic and not superficially compliant. Third, the entire Jiangxi must be mobilized to cooperate as one, implement the creed of being practical, working hard, working solidly, and working quickly. It is necessary to cherish time, and the work of one day must be done in two days. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the only weapons for suppressing bandits. We must lead by example to reverse the declining trend. Suppressing bandits, in particular, is to attack the mind. To attack the enemy's mind, we must first attack our own mind. Only in this way can we assume the responsibility of suppressing the Red Bandits and complete the task of suppressing the Red Bandits." From this, Chiang's intentions and strategies can be seen. As for the real strength of the bandit suppression, it is estimated to be more than 300,000 troops, which is more than ten times the bandit troops of the Zhu Mao pseudo-135th Army Corps. Therefore, the troops are sufficient for distribution, but the only problem lies in unified command and close coordination. Chiang paid special attention to this in order to encircle and annihilate the bandits. However, to avoid reality, the bandits withdrew from Dongxiang on the 25th, Xuwan on the 26th, Jinxi on the 28th, and the Zuofangying and Huangshidu areas of their base camp on the 29th and 30th. According to reports from the front line, the bandits have desperately retreated from Zixi and Lichuan to Jianning and Ninghua in western Fujian and Guangchang and Shicheng in southern Jiangxi, and will completely abandon eastern Jiangxi and retreat to the old nests in the mountains on the borders of Jiangxi and Fujian, fortifying their walls and clearing the fields to exhaust our troops, or make other plans along the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. From the current situation, the recovery of Zixi and Lichuan seems to be no problem. However, Chiang's visit to Jiangxi this time is not to drive the bandits away, but to annihilate the main force of the bandits in order to fundamentally eliminate them. Therefore, in addition to telegraphing Cai in Fujian, Chen in Guangdong, and Yu Hanmou, Liu Heding, Zhang Zhen, Liu Zhennian, Zhao Guantao, and other border area generals to jointly suppress bandits along the borders of Jiangxi and Fujian, he also telegraphed the front-line generals to the province to hold a military conference. The participants included Chen Cheng, commander-in-chief of the forward line, Sun Lianzhong, commander-in-chief of the 26th Route, Wu Qiwu, commander of the 4th Army, Li Mo'an, commander of the 10th Division, Luo Zhuoying, commander of the 11th Division, He Guoguang, chief of staff of the three provinces' headquarters, and senior personnel of the headquarters. The meeting was held from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 31st of last month. The content is related to military plans and is still unknown. However, after the meeting, the generals returned to their defenses and supervised the advance of the troops. It is faintly heard that the various units with the 18th Army as the main force have arrived in Zixi, and the Li and Tao divisions in Liangnan are moving towards Lichuan. The Li Yunheng, Zhou Hunyuan, and Wang Jinwen divisions are advancing from Guixi towards the Fujian border in coordination. The divisions will further attack the Fujian border. The provincial air force has been flying to the Fujian border for reconnaissance and bombing for several days, and they are also very busy.</p>
<p>The gentry, farmers, merchants, students, women, and free professional groups in the province held a joint meeting at the Desheng Grand Theater on the 1st, with hundreds of organizations attending. A Jiangxi All-Circles Assistance Bandit Suppression Committee was established, and Zhou Guanhong and 27 others were elected as executive committee members. Fan Zhengbo, Xu Ruifu, Min Binru, Xia Jia, Yu Shukun, Ouyang Wu, and Peng Chengwan were appointed to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek together with Governor of Jiangxi Xiong Shihui to express assistance in suppressing bandits.

<h3 id="e81">Several Major Issues in the Draft Constitution <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke's Published Opinions</p>
<p>Beijing News: Recently, the people of the country have attached great importance to the drafting of the constitution. Regarding the most important points of the constitution, according to Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, opinions were published yesterday, recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e82">Determining Principles <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(Reporter asked) Has the Central Political Committee determined the principles of the draft constitution? (Sun Ke replied) The highest principle of the draft constitution is based on the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. The first step is for the Constitutional Drafting Committee of this Yuan to formulate an outline and submit it to the Central Political Committee to determine the drafting principles, and then submit it to this Yuan for group research. Each group will conduct in-depth discussions on a specific issue, draft clauses, and formally announce them. Individual experts in the country will be asked to conduct individual research to provide reference for the drafting committee, in order to collect opinions widely. Only in this way can it be in line with national conditions, because in the past, the constitutions promulgated in our country did not meet the needs of the people and only copied others, resulting in criticism of closing the door and building a cart. Other matters such as the collection of materials and the investigation of public sentiment have already begun. After the talk will be held next week to allocate work, it will begin immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Head of State System <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Question) During the constitutional period, will the head of state of the government adopt a presidential system or a committee system? (Answer) According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Founding Program, it is clearly stipulated as a presidential system. In fact, the title of the head of state, whether president or chairman, is acceptable. The important point lies in the provisions of the powers. However, the current organization of the National Government is a committee system. Analyzing its meaning, it should obviously bear the weight of the country's entire administration, but at the same time, the Executive Yuan is responsible to another meeting organization outside the National Government, which forms what is generally called a responsible cabinet system. Then the National Government has nothing to do. In my opinion, the system of our country's political organization does not have to be the same as that of European and American countries, because the National Government is based on five places standing side by side, and the central hub of politics is concentrated in the Central Political Conference. If the Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet, and the other four Yuans, the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, are equally obedient to the Central Political Conference, then what will its name mean? Therefore, the provisions regarding the powers of the head of state in the future should not go beyond two paths: (1) The head of state concurrently serves as the head of the executive branch; (2) The head of state only bears the name of representing the country internally and externally, but does not bear the responsibility of administration. Which way to go still needs to be discussed before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Referendum Authority <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(Question) The referendum is one of the direct democratic rights and is extremely important for the quality of politics. However, how should it be stipulated to be in line with our country's national conditions? (Answer) The scope of the referendum on ordinary laws is strictly restricted in European and American countries, to the extent that the people have no way to exercise it. If so, it is tantamount to剥削 the people's due rights and abilities. Looking at Germany's experience, the people mostly lack interest in the referendum. If the scope of the referendum is expanded as much as possible, and everything is changed, it will only delay things more, and the decision of policies will be hindered. The first drawback is that the people, feeling the complexity of the referendum, will tend to give up voting willingly. If so, how can the problem be solved? The second drawback is that our country's current level of education is still young, local autonomy has not yet been fully realized, the population lacks accurate statistics, and the strength of the security forces is weak, all of which are enough to affect the implementation of the referendum. Other matters such as elections, recall, and initiative also suffer from the same difficulties. Looking back at our country's past election results is enough to see the future. The only remedy is for the government to vigorously promote education and promote local autonomy. Only then can it be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Land Issue <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Question) How will the land policy be stipulated in the future? (Answer) The purpose of the state's land consolidation is to make the best use of the land and to enable the people to have the right to enjoy and use the land equally. The essence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of equalization of land ownership lies in this. To achieve this advocacy, it is necessary to prevent private monopolies of land in order to seek improper gains, and it is also necessary to find ways to make the increase in the value of the land itself, which is not obtained as a result of capital and labor improvements, be owned by the public. In order to achieve this goal, the most effective means is to levy taxes according to land value and to collect land appreciation tax. The main points are: (1) Land tax is levied based on value; (2) Land tax adopts a progressive approach; (3) A progressive tax is levied on unearned land appreciation; (4) Light taxes on land improvements; (5) Government's method of acquiring private land; (6) Tax-exempt land; (7) Promote land improvement by increasing land tax or estimating high land value; however, the Land Law was promulgated by the central government long ago. The second important task is to wait for the completion of the Land Implementation Law. In the draft constitution, only the outline can be listed.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Accommodating Political Parties <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>(Question) In the future, what will be the scope of accommodating political parties? (Answer) Accommodating political parties is the advocacy of the general public outside the party, and I also agree with this proposal. In order to improve the country's politics, the central government is also very willing to allow the existence of other political parties, but on the principle of not opposing the Three Principles of the People, because our country is building the country based on the Three Principles of the People. If it violates the Three Principles of the People, it is tantamount to violating the essentials of nation-building. Some say that since there are several political parties with different doctrines in European and American countries, and the state allows them to exist at the same time, why does our country have to be unique? However, the national conditions of various countries are obviously different. Given China's current backwardness in education, economy, construction, transportation, and various other aspects, it is already difficult to promote governance even if the entire nation stands on the same political ideological line. If many diametrically opposed political views suddenly appear, I am afraid that the harm will be tasted before the benefit is seen. It is no different from forcing an infant who is still in swaddling clothes to run, and it is unlikely that he will not fall.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Scope of Amendments <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>(Question) After the draft constitution is completed, should the scope of amendments to the draft constitution be stipulated in advance when the National Assembly is convened? (Answer) This point should be determined according to whether there is a need for future facts. (Question) Should the current Yuans and ministries be established under the separation of five powers? (Answer) Opinions on this issue vary. However, the state's establishment of officials and implementation of policies should first be based on setting up people according to the needs of the matter. Whether there is a need to change the current system in the future should be based on public opinion. Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Zhang Zhiben about his advocacy of drafting the constitution at Tianping Mountain, and asked Mr. Sun what his opinion was. Mr. Sun replied that Mr. Zhang's intention was good, but the members of the Constitutional Drafting Committee themselves have other responsibilities. If all the members leave the capital at the same time, it will have an impact on the Yuan's affairs alone. This refers to the facts. (Riri News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Current Situation and Crisis in Kang and Tibet After the Sichuan War <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Unable to Focus Westward</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama Seizes the Opportunity to Eye Kang</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: The long-standing Kang-Tibet dispute has remained unresolved due to repeated delays by the authorities. Last year, Tibetan troops retreated temporarily to avoid attacks by Liu Wenhui's army, intending to regroup in the future to realize their aspiration of unifying Kang and Tibet. Those unaware of the true situation in Kang and Tibet mistakenly believed that the Tibetans would not dare to invade again. In reality, if the Tibetan army finds an opportunity, it will still launch large-scale military operations. A visitor from Xikang spoke of the recent situation on the Kang-Tibet border and the critical crisis. This is recorded below to inform the nation:</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the Kang-Tibet war last year, Xikang Province has had a troop strength of three brigades. The main force is concentrated in Dege (originally occupied by Tibetan troops, but recovered after the war) and confronts the Tibetan forces across the Jinsha River. There have been no conflicts between the two sides. Subsequently, the Sichuan war broke out, and Liu Wenhui had no time to focus on Xikang, so he transferred a large part of the troops back to Sichuan to participate in the war. As a result, the defense of Xikang is extremely weak and there is a danger of being attacked by the Tibetan army at any time. The reasons why this has not turned into a major incident are: Firstly, an internal strife once occurred in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama was driven away by the opposition. At this time, there was also talk of the British sending troops into Tibet to suppress the opposition. Seeing this situation, the opposition was deeply afraid that the British would send troops to invade Tibet and eliminate their forces (the Tibetan monastic class opposed to the Dalai Lama, especially against the British). Therefore, they made concessions to the Dalai Lama. Soon, the Dalai Lama safely returned to Lhasa to preside over political and religious affairs. As a result, he was unable to manage Xikang. This is a major reason why the border defense of Xikang can be temporarily safe. Secondly, the weather in Xikang turned cold, and the snow accumulated more than a foot deep, making it difficult for marching. At the same time, the Qinghai army under Ma Bufang also assisted the Sichuan-Kang army in defending against Tibet, so they can live in peace. Although there are small conflicts on the Jinsha River, it is difficult to form a war situation. This is another reason for the safety of the Xikang border defense. However, the current trend is that the Tibetan army is already preparing for a large-scale invasion. At the same time, the political situation in Xikang is also extremely chaotic, so the western border defense is in a dangerous state. According to reliable sources, there are currently no more than one brigade of Sichuan troops in Xikang. Deng Xiang, the commander of the Second Brigade of the First Division of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Army, has now left Dege. A small number of troops at the front have deserted mostly because they cannot endure the cold and hardship. If the Tibetan army invades again, there will be no ability to resist. As for the defense of southern Kang, it is maintained by the Fourth Regiment and Second Battalion under Ma Chenglong in Ba'an County. Kangding, the capital district of Xikang, has long been in a state of anarchy since the Political Affairs Committee was abolished. Now, the military and political affairs of Xikang are entirely presided over by Brigadier General Deng Xiang alone. Deng is originally a soldier and does not understand politics. Recently, he also feels exhausted. The soldiers are full of complaints because they cannot get paid. They are also extremely negligent in defense. Recently, due to the results of the Sichuan war, Liu Wenhui has no ability to focus westward. As a result, rumors are rampant in Kangding. At one moment, it is rumored that Liu Wenhui will retreat to Xikang in defeat. At another moment, it is rumored that the Tibetan troops will take the opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion. Seeing this situation, Deng Xiang specifically announced martial law in Kangding and appointed Zhang Zhenzhong, the commander of the Fortieth Regiment, as the commander of the Kangding city defense, responsible for maintaining security in Kangding. The regiment was originally stationed in the front of Dege, but has now been secretly transferred back to rehearse its empty city plan to intimidate the Tibetans. Unfortunately, the Tibetan side discovered it. It is heard that the key pass of Qamdo (Xikang) is now occupied by the Tibetan army as a place to station troops to spy on Kang.) The Tibetan soldiers are eager to try and are consulting the Dalai Lama. Therefore, the future of the Kang border is cause for concern."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Wu Zhongxin Returns to Anhui to Resume His Duties <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Organizing the Finances and Security Forces of Various Counties</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Wu Zhongxin, the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, felt that the finances were difficult and his work was constrained. Therefore, at the end of last year, he took the opportunity to attend the Third Plenary Session in Beijing and repeatedly resigned to the Central Government. He lingered in Suzhou and Shanghai, unwilling to return to his post. Recently, the Central Government, feeling that the national crisis was becoming more urgent, exhorted him with righteousness and promised that the Ministry of Finance would allocate 100,000 yuan per month from the aid funds to Anhui Province. Wu then returned to the province on the Qingpu ship at 4 pm on the 31st of last month, accompanied by Ye Yuanlong, the Director of Finance, Liu Yiyan, the Director of Construction, and secretaries Mei Guangyu and Zeng Xiaolu, and resumed his duties on the same day. Luo Liangjian, the Director of Civil Affairs, and Zhang Dingxun, the Provincial Committee Member and Director of Security, will also return soon. According to Wu, the things he intends to actively carry out in the near future are: 1. Cleaning up the local finances of various counties; 2. Reorganizing the security forces of various counties; 3. Opening up roads in the provincial capital. Detailed measures for each of these items are currently being drafted. In order to assess the administrative performance of various counties, the Department of Civil Affairs issued administrative report forms and instructions in June of last year, ordering each county to compile detailed reports from July of last year and submit them to the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs for review within five days after the end of each month. However, most counties failed to comply and submit the reports, making it impossible to conduct assessments. Therefore, the counties have been telegraphed again, requiring them to fill in and submit monthly administrative reports from January of this year, detailing the important policies related to reforms carried out during the month, the progress of handling them, the current stage of progress, the implementation of new laws and regulations, and various matters such as bandit suppression and rural cleansing, in accordance with the original forms, and submit them by the end of the fifth day of each month for assessment.

<h3 id="e90">The Declining Social Scene in Fuzhou <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Many Small and Medium-Sized Stores Have Closed Down</p>
<p>Refugees from Northern Fujian Still Have No Relief Measures</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian's commerce was extremely depressed last year due to the impact of the current situation. Exports such as tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoots have been completely halted due to the increasingly dangerous situation in the north. Imports such as silk fabrics from Jiangsu and Guangdong are also sluggish due to the changing situation in the province and the sudden increase in unemployment. Businesses are unable to turn over capital and are flocking to banks and money shops to withdraw funds for emergency relief. Seeing this situation, the banking and money industries are also holding firm and tightening credit. For shops that are not very solid, they are cutting off loans to those whose current account books cannot be cleared on time. Even for reliable shops, the amount of loans is greatly reduced. Therefore, the amount of checks for receipts and payments in the market has recently been no more than five or six hundred yuan at most, and it is rare to see two or three thousand yuan. As credit becomes tighter, the number of bankruptcies increased greatly during the Lunar New Year settlement period. However, most of those that went bankrupt were small and medium-sized stores. Few bankruptcies amounted to more than ten thousand yuan. Because the smaller the business, the narrower the scope of activity. Whenever money shops cut off loans, there is no other way but to declare bankruptcy. On the social front, because money shops are mostly unable to recover the loans they have made, their coffers are necessarily empty. If a store's reputation is slightly bad, there are rumors that it will become unstable. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the two branches of the Southeast Bank in Chengtan simultaneously experienced bank runs, and the situation was extremely turbulent. Fortunately, peer banks such as Huainan, Fufeng, and Yi Yuan provided strong assistance, which helped them overcome the difficulties. By late evening, the situation gradually subsided. It was found that the bank was opened by the naval community and issued about one million yuan in banknotes. About 500,000 yuan were circulating in northern Fujian, and the rest were scattered in the Fuzhou market. On that day, the salaries issued by the military and political circles mostly used the bank's banknotes, and those circulating in northern Fujian were returned to Fuzhou for settlement, causing the Southeast Bank's banknotes to suddenly become crowded in the market, causing social misunderstandings. As for pawnshops, after political figures became unemployed, many resorted to pawning goods for a living. There were more pawnings than redemptions, and capital was limited, making it impossible to turn over capital. Therefore, two measures were discussed and decided: one was to shorten business hours, opening for only four hours in the morning and closing in the afternoon; the other was to limit the amount of pawns, with a maximum price of only ten yuan for any item. As a result, the lives of ordinary people became even more difficult. However, the most suffering were the refugees from Chong'an and Guangze counties in northern Fujian who fled the red disaster to the province last autumn, numbering about several hundred. They lived in various temples and guild halls, and the government has not yet provided any relief measures. They are entirely dependent on various charitable organizations and philanthropists to provide food on a rotating basis. Now, due to the long duration of the disaster, their strength is exhausted, and they have also stopped providing relief. These refugees have fallen into a state of hunger and cold. Although representatives have run around and appealed, no one has responded, and they will soon become ghosts in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Preliminary Estimates of Main Crop Harvests</p>
<p>Department of Agricultural Economics, Jinling University</p>
<p>In order to help people understand the agricultural situation in the country, the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University's College of Agriculture has been conducting a national agricultural situation survey and assessment on a trial basis since January 1932. This survey includes the harvest and yield of major agricultural products in each province and the facts about the prosperity and decline of the rural economy in various regions. On January 1 of this year, preliminary estimates of the harvest of major crops in Jiangsu Province were published. Now, based on 345 reports from 99 counties in Hebei Province, preliminary estimates of the harvest of major crops in Hebei Province are made as follows:</p>

<p>Council of State to be Convened Within the Year</p>
<p>Little Hope for League of Nations' Recommendations</p>
<p>Southwest Decides to Cooperate with the Central Government</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Committee, went to Beijing to attend the drafting committee of the Organizational Regulations of the National Council of State. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, he returned to Shanghai from Beijing by night express train. A reporter from this newspaper visited Wu at his residence yesterday and was granted an audience. Wu spoke in detail about the National Council of State, the Rehe issue, and the recent international situation. He also said that he had expressed his determination to the Central Government not to take up the position of Minister of Justice. His remarks are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e109">National Council of State <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Wu first said that the drafting committee of the Organizational Regulations of the National Council of State was appointed by the Central Political Council and is dedicated to discussing the method of producing the National Council of State and all organizational laws and regulations. It is now scheduled to hold a meeting once a week, and I will also go to Beijing to attend at any time. It is expected that all work will be completed in one or two months. Then, it will be handed over to the Central Political Council to the Legislative Yuan, which will formulate various laws and regulations based on the principles agreed upon by this committee. As for the convocation period, in any case, it will be within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Our Advantage Lies in Perseverance <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Wu also said that the Japanese army's attack on Rehe is a foregone conclusion. Our country also has considerable preparations. In any case, we must do our best to contend with the enemy, so that the enemy must pay twelve points in return to obtain even an inch of our land. From a military point of view, our advantage lies in perseverance, and the enemy's advantage lies in a quick battle. Therefore, temporary victories or defeats are not worth paying attention to. There must be a real long-term resistance. The enemy will be exhausted, and the domestic economy will tend to collapse due to military consumption. Once the weakness is broken, the final victory will belong to us.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Only Two Miles a Day <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Wu then cited a very wonderful analogy: In the Battle of Shanghai, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army bravely resisted the Japanese for more than 30 days before calmly retreating to the second line of defense. The Japanese army's expansion was limited to Nanxiang. From Shanghai to Wusong to Nanxiang, it was about 60 Chinese miles, that is, only two miles were lost per day. The Japanese army gained only 60 miles at such a heavy sacrifice. I hope that the Rehe defending army will not let the 19th Route Army and others monopolize the beauty of the past.</p>
<h3 id="e112">English Mediation <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The reporter inquired about the widely rumored mediation by British Ambassador Lampson, and the proposed buffer zone neutral territory, etc. Mr. Wu said he had not heard of them, only stating that since the British Foreign Office had formally denied siding with Japan and the existence of a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement, there would be no further obvious actions. The League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen's recommendation report is about to be completed, and we should wait and see the facts. However, I deeply believe that no matter what, it will definitely not harm Japan or force Japan to obey. The maximum our country can obtain is only the sympathy of international moral opinion. I have never had extravagant hopes for the League of Nations from the beginning, so the result today is not disappointing.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Southwest Decides to Cooperate <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Southwest, there have been various rumors of provocations by the Japanese. Mr. Wu said that as far as he knows, if the central government is determined to resist, the Southwest will cooperate with the central government. As for my position as Minister of Justice and Administration, I have already expressed my firm intention to the central government not to take it. Finally, regarding the incident of Gu Zhutong illegally shooting journalist Liu Yusheng, Mr. Wu stated that even in the late Qing Dynasty, when political darkness reached its peak, officials still did not dare to treat human life lightly. Prisoners awaiting trial had to wait for the Qing Emperor's endorsement before being executed in the autumn assizes. Today, even company commanders and platoon leaders can casually put people to death. His words were filled with emotion.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Sun Ke Discusses Issues Such as Political Participation and Constitutionalism <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The powers of the Political Participation Council and the Legislative Yuan do not conflict.</p>
<p>Drafting of the constitution is in active preparation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai the night before last from Nanjing with Legislative Yuan members Ma Chaojun, Jian Youwen, Zhong Tianxin, Chen Jianru, and others. A Central News Agency reporter visited them yesterday morning, and the following is a record of their conversations:</p>
<h3 id="e115">National Political Participation <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The drafting committee of the organizational regulations for the National Political Participation Council held its first meeting in Nanjing on the 2nd, where they discussed in detail issues such as the number of members, method of selection, powers, and term of office. However, no concrete decisions have been made and further discussions are needed. The National Political Participation Council is a public opinion organ during the period of political tutelage, which summarizes national public opinion and presents it to the government, serving as a transitional mechanism from political tutelage to constitutionalism. In other words, it is the "ladder" for entering the constitutional period. Therefore, its central task is not "legislation" but "recommendation", which is different from the Legislative Yuan's task of "legislation". Rumors that the establishment of the National Political Participation Council will lead to conflicts with the Legislative Yuan in terms of powers are based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the two. As for the selection and number of members of the National Political Participation Council, a small number will be appointed by the central government, and the majority will be elected, so that it becomes a public opinion organ worthy of the name. Due to the fact that local autonomy in various provinces has not been fully implemented, general elections are difficult to carry out, and a group election method will be adopted. All parties do not advocate for too many members, but a number greater than the number of legislators is acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Legislative Work <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The drafting of the constitution is in active preparation, and the first meeting of the draft committee has been scheduled for the 9th of this month to discuss methods of grouping and soliciting opinions on the draft constitution from all walks of life. The revision of current civil and criminal laws and regulations is also under consideration. I believe that in the past, the drafting of various laws and regulations was often done by a few people based on subjective opinions, which was almost like building a car behind closed doors. Laws and regulations of this kind of "paperwork" naturally cannot fully conform to the national sentiment, and foreignized laws and regulations drafted solely based on foreign laws and regulations are even less suitable for our country's situation. The Legislative Yuan should eliminate this drawback in the future. Whenever a law is enacted, a general outline must first be drafted, distributed to various places, and solicit opinions from all localities as much as possible for reference. Such legislation can be suitable for local conditions, because legislation should emphasize public sentiment, not just legal principles.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Reorganizing Laws and Regulations <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Central Political Council has resolved to establish an Administrative Regulations Reorganization Committee, because it recognizes that the organizations of various agencies under the National Government are complex, and the laws and regulations are inconsistent, which causes great inconvenience in administration. Therefore, it is now actively planning to complete the reorganization work within one year. The chairman is concurrently held by Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The League of Nations is Powerless <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Japan has long had the idea of withdrawing from the League of Nations, perhaps because the League of Nations has not been able to completely prevent its invasion of China. In our country, recently, due to the weakness and powerlessness of the League of Nations, which has been unable to solve the Northeast problem for more than a year, some people advocate withdrawing from the League of Nations. This is because they believe that the League of Nations cannot speak out for justice and implement its covenants. In order to maintain the credibility of the League of Nations and maintain world peace, it can resolutely withdraw when necessary. Britain and France are the pillars of the League of Nations. We hope that the governments of both countries will respect international charters and take concrete actions. Britain has now stated that it is prepared to base its actions on the Lytton Report. What the result will be remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Southwest National Defense <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Due to the geographical relationship, the southwestern provinces have close ties in terms of defense. It is now heard that there is also an organization of the Southwest National Defense Committee, but it can only be formally established after the central government approves it. The central government also has a proposed National Defense Committee. In the future, the Southwest National Defense Committee can be subordinate to the Central National Defense Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Other Issues <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke believes that the case of the Jiangsu Provincial Government shooting Liu Yusheng was a major mistake. Sun continued by saying that with regard to the southward relocation of cultural relics from Beiping, land and people are ultimately more important than cultural relics, so it does not seem appropriate to relocate cultural relics urgently. Sun said that because he had to attend the preparatory meeting of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Institute, he would return to Nanjing around Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to Encourage Tang Yulin <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Only you can be relied on to keep the country intact.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Tang in Chengde yesterday, saying that since the Japanese army is about to launch a large-scale attack on Rehe again: "Chairman Tang of Chengde, Xunjian, I received the telegram on Jianri, and I also saw Chief Cui's report from Kailu, a colorful telegram rejecting the enemy. It shows your sincerity in defending the country and the unity of the soldiers. I deeply admire you. All sectors of the city have recently organized a consolation association. We will do our best to raise donations for the supplies needed on the front line to serve as a backing. With a strong enemy in front of us and the war just beginning, I still hope that you will consult with Director Zhang in Beiping to actively plan for defense. Only you can be relied on to keep the country intact." Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Actively Raise Funds to Purchase Airplanes</p>
<h3 id="e122">Raising Funds for the "National Goods" Aircraft <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods, at its first dinner party for the National Goods Year, Chen Binghui proposed that the four national goods organizations should jointly raise funds for the "National Goods" aircraft to save the country. It is now known that the association yesterday sent letters to the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Association, and the Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, inviting them to send representatives to negotiate in order to expedite the matter. The original letter said: "At our association's first dinner party for the National Goods Year, Comrade Chen Binghui, representative of the Dacheng Weaving Factory, proposed that the four national goods organizations should jointly raise funds for the 'National Goods' aircraft to strengthen the power to save the country, which was unanimously approved. Considering that aviation is a recognized way to save the country, and the national goods community, as a force to save the country, dares not lag behind in fulfilling its national obligations, but because this matter is of great importance, there should be full consultation. Therefore, it is scheduled to convene a meeting of representatives from the four organizations at the China National Goods Maintenance Association at Nine Mu Di at 3:00 pm on Thursday, the 9th of this month. At that time, please send five representatives from your association to attend the meeting to discuss how to proceed."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Donating to Purchase the "Children's" Aircraft <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Since Fang Xiaoruo and other children in this city initiated the purchase of the "Shanghai Children's" aircraft, all children in this city know the urgency of saving the country through aviation. They have been saving money from their New Year's candies and donating enthusiastically. In the past two days, Mayor Wu has received dozens of letters from children donating money, totaling over two hundred dollars. The mayor is very pleased and, in addition to turning the donations over to the China Aviation Association and issuing receipts separately, has given encouraging replies to each of the donating children. It is also heard that two girls, Qu Yulan and Qu Yuzhen, who had no money to donate, each donated their knitted woolen outer shirts for conversion into funds for purchasing an aircraft, which is especially commendable. The names of the donating children and the amount of their donations are listed below: Huang Weigong four yuan, Huang Weikuan four yuan, Huang Weixian two yuan, Huang Weizhi two yuan, Huang Weiren two yuan, Huang Weide two yuan, Huang Weixin one yuan and two jiao, Huang Weiwan one yuan, Sun Shuyan one yuan, Sun Jiming one yuan, Sun Jichou one yuan, Chen Baobao five jiao, Chen Baochang one yuan, Huang Weiyi eight jiao, Huang Weimin eight jiao, Huang Weihui six jiao, Huang Weirang six jiao, Huang Weiwen four jiao, Huang Weizhuang four jiao, Huang Weiliang four jiao, Huang Weiyong one yuan, Huang Weijian eight copper coins, Huang Weihe one yuan, Xu Zhaoxiang, Xu Yunfang, Xu Binfang jointly donated one hundred yuan, Zhu Jiadong two yuan, Lin Peizhen, Lin Peiying, Lin Peiyu, Lin Dingzhong jointly donated eight yuan, all students of Yafeng Elementary School ten yuan, Xi Jufen two yuan, Zhu Rongshi sisters jointly donated three yuan, Cai Jifu two yuan, Chen Mingchang, Chen Shengchang, Chen Xiuzhen jointly donated three yuan, Shen Yaoxiong, Shen Yaoqi, Shen Yaoji jointly donated sixty yuan, Zhu Yixian, Zhu Ruixian jointly donated two yuan, Qu Yulan, Qu Yuzhen jointly donated two woolen coats, Feng Hanchen, Feng Shichang jointly donated ten yuan, Shen Weici, Shen Weishan, Jiang Jiaji, Shen Weiming jointly donated four yuan, Chen Shiyuan one yuan, Yu Wei Yue ten yuan, Huang Zhongwei five yuan, Jiang Lin, Jiang Yan Yin four yuan, Wang Yiji two yuan, Fang Jiasheng one yuan.</p>

<p>The Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Geng Jizhou, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, reporting the attack on Chaoyang. The original text is as follows: "To the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association and all newspapers and public organizations: Hao Dian Liang Yao Qing Yue. Our troops, led by the commander in person, attacked Chaoyang Temple on the 12th with more than 3,000 infantry and cavalry. More than 500 Japanese troops and more than 1,000 puppet Manchurian troops resolutely resisted. Our army bravely attacked and fought fiercely for a day and night. When the ammunition was exhausted, we engaged in hand-to-hand combat and captured and occupied it at dawn on the 13th, completely restoring it. More than 170 enemies were killed, more than 20 were captured, and a train of locomotives was seized, and a large number of military supplies were obtained. More than 30 officers and soldiers of our army were killed or injured. We are currently advancing towards Jinzhou and Yi County. I am hereby reporting and hope that it will be forwarded to all newspapers and public organizations." Geng Jizhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>The Mission and Impressions of Going to Beiping</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, returned to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about his mission and impressions of going to Beiping. The questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Question) There are different rumors about your mission to Beiping this time. What is it? (Answer) I went to Beiping this time to inspect the work of the Institute of History and Language and the Institute of Psychology of the Academia Sinica in Beiping, and to discuss the progress plans of the two institutes. At the same time, I took the opportunity to assist Mr. Li Ji and Hu Shi in organizing the Beiping Branch of the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights, and entrusted by a friend to deliver a letter to the China Women's Relief and Comfort Association in Beiping, and to investigate the organization and equipment of the Northern Relief and Anti-Japanese Wounded Soldiers. This trip does not represent any individual. I made a solemn statement in the Women's Relief and Comfort Association. (Question) I heard that you inspected the wounded soldier hospitals and various prisons. What did you see? (Answer) The only place in Beiping that now houses wounded soldiers is the Weishu Hospital, which has 600 wounded soldiers, about one-third of whom were injured in Yuguan by the Ninth Brigade. The hospital was converted from a factory, and the monthly funding is only three to four thousand yuan, so the equipment is very simple. In addition, there is a temporary relief hospital that is still being prepared, located in the old barracks of the Shifuyuan, which is larger in area and can accommodate 2,000 beds, and is managed by the Beiping Municipal Government. Recently, no new wounded soldiers have been sent from the Yuguan area. It is heard that the most needed for relief are in the Rehe area, but the climate there is extremely cold and the transportation is very inconvenient, and adequate preparations must be made before it can be dealt with. As for the inspection of prisons, it was because the Beiping Branch of the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights elected me, Mr. Hu Shi, and Cheng Ping to visit political prisoners detained in Beiping. The places we went to were the Army Prison Military Branch, the Repentance Institute, and the Detention Center of the Military Law Enforcement Office. There are about 30 political prisoners in the Army Prison, and all 92 people in the Repentance Institute are political prisoners. There are more than 20 political prisoners in the Detention Center of the Military Law Enforcement Office. In recent months, some of the students arrested by the Anti-Japanese Association have been convicted and entered the Repentance Institute, and some are still in the detention center. All the prisoners in the above three places wear extremely heavy fetters. Their detention is based on the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China and has not been formally tried in court. (Question) What is the situation of the southward relocation of cultural relics in Beiping? (Answer) More than 3,000 boxes of cultural relics from the Palace Museum in Beiping have been packed, but due to the difficulty of vehicles and the laziness of the laborers, they have not yet been loaded when I left. As for the 120 boxes that were rumored to have arrived in Shanghai, they are fragments of excavated cultural relics, rubbings, and books and instruments for research by the two institutes of the Academia Sinica in Beiping, because a part of the two institutes has been decided by the institute to move south.</p>

It is heard that Chen visited various countries in Europe and the United States, announcing the truth about Japan's invasion of our country. He has a very close friendship with the new American President Roosevelt, who will soon take office. According to a letter from Chen to his friends in Shanghai during his travels, Roosevelt has a particularly good impression of our country. The President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Zhesheng, returned to Shanghai to welcome Chen. Yu Ming, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, was previously summoned to Nanjing by Foreign Minister Luo to consult about Chen's return to China, because Chen is skilled in diplomacy and his assistance can be obtained in handling foreign affairs after he returns to China.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Water Fee Problem is Becoming Increasingly Complex <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The company uses water cut-offs as a means of increasing fees.</p>
<p>Users use water tapping as a means of self-defense.</p>
<p>||| Real Estate Sector's Emergency Meeting Tomorrow |||</p>
<p>The water fee problem in the Public Concession, in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), due to the fluctuating gold and silver exchange rates, the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company requested and was approved by the Public Works Department to add a surcharge of one-fourth. For a time, people rose up in opposition, and water cut-offs and non-payment turned into a huge storm. Fortunately, the Public Works Department handled it appropriately, and the first stage came to an end. Last year, the water company, based on a report by Hill's experts, believed that controlling the waste of tap water was the only solution and proposed the widespread installation of water meters to calculate water fees. After being approved by the Public Works Department and installing the meters, the waste was not controlled, and the water meters were several times higher than the rent when calculated based on the rent. In some cases, it even exceeded the rent. The landlords who paid the water fees then requested the Shanghai Real Estate Association to negotiate, but it was not resolved. After several months of delay, someone mediated and invited representatives from the Public Works Department, the water company, and the Real Estate Association to exchange views. The mediator and the water company and the Real Estate Association each submitted statements for further discussion. At the same time, the landlords were about to decide whether to pay the water fees based on the inclusive water system. However, the water company either completely refused or demanded additional payments, otherwise they would cut off the water. Those whose water was cut off included the Yangshupu, Huasheng Road, Fenzhou Road, Biford, and Bilu industrial properties of Elly &amp; Company. The water company closed the faucets at 11:00 am last December. Next, starting from February 12, the Tangshan Road and Baoding Road of Huada Foreign Company, Fuyuanli, the Zhejiang Road and Niuzhuang Road of Fenxing Company, Weishuifang, the Yangshupu Road and Huaxingfang of the American-owned Yizhong Bank Company, and the Lingqing Road and Qinyuli industrial properties of Qinyu Company all received the same treatment from the water company. The above industrial properties had dozens, hundreds, or even two to three hundred buildings, either in the commercial center or in the workers' area. After the water was cut off, people were greatly frightened, as if a great disaster was about to happen. The landlords, because people cannot live without water for a moment, were forced to implement emergency self-defense under the law and automatically tapped the water to ensure the lives of the residents and maintain public safety. The Shanghai Real Estate Association saw that the situation was becoming increasingly serious. On the one hand, it sent a letter to the Public Works Department and the water company, and on the other hand, it convened an emergency meeting. The association's letters are excerpted below:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Real Estate Sector's ······ Emergency Meeting Tomorrow <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday urgently sent a letter to all members saying, "Most urgent: Since the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company forced the installation of water meters, water fees have skyrocketed, and property owners cannot afford it. Most have paid at the old prices, leaving the rest to be resolved. However, recently, because they were unsuccessful in forcing price increases, they implemented high-pressure tactics, cutting off the water supply. Landlords and tenants alike are suffering and have reported to the association. It has now been decided to convene an emergency meeting of the entire real estate sector at the association's office at 96 Beijing Road at 3:00 pm on Monday, February 6, and representatives of tenants whose water has been cut off are requested to report on the situation. We hope you will attend the meeting at that time and propose solutions as much as possible. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Real Estate Association ··· To the Public Works Department <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>"We would like to inquire about the water price issue, which has been suspended for a long time. The opinions of all parties have been submitted to your bureau for two months, and citizens often inquire with this association about what solutions your bureau has adopted for this matter. Since the waterworks company has been cutting off the water supply during this period, the situation has become more complicated, and it is difficult to conceal the anger of the people. Most of the landlords whose water has been cut off are waiting for the results of the meeting to decide on a solution. Being suddenly subjected to adversity, how can they bear it? Some landlords have even paid according to the old prices out of consideration for the company, but the company has refused to accept it. Within this week, there have been three cases of water cut-offs: 1. The water supply to the Yuanfuli houses on Baoding Road, leased by Huada Foreign Company, was cut off at 2:00 pm on January 30. 2. The water supply to the Huaxinfang houses on Yangshupu Road, leased by Yizhong Company, was cut off at 2:00 pm on January 31. 3. The water supply to the Weishuifang houses on Niuzhuang Road, leased by Fenxing Company, was cut off at 10:00 am on February 2. While mediation is underway and the entire case is being handled by your bureau in order to find a satisfactory solution, the above cases have occurred one after another, which is what this association does not understand. Since the waterworks company has accepted mediation, it should not adopt such extreme measures against users, especially when the amount of water prices to be paid by users is the crux of the problem and urgently needs to be resolved. This kind of action is greatly contrary to local welfare. We believe that your bureau and this association share the same view. Before the entire problem is resolved, it should be stopped immediately. Now your bureau is aware of the opinions accumulated by all parties concerned. Can you please provide details of the solutions you intend to formulate to resolve this case? Prolonging this matter is really useless. We are sending this letter accordingly, and we hope you will investigate it."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Real Estate Association ··· To the Waterworks Company <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>"We would like to inform you that the member Fenxing Company has sent a letter stating that it has received a letter from the British Waterworks Company instructing it to find 153 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen to make up for the water fees before November of last year, and that it must be paid before February 1 of this year, otherwise the water will be cut off. This company acts entirely on justice and fairness and on the ability to abide by legal and moral principles. Therefore, all water fees before November of last year have been paid in accordance with the regulations. If we were to allow people to take whatever they want under duress, how would we protect our legal interests? In short, this company will comply with whatever method is decided by all three parties. Before the three parties decide on a method, except for the water fees that have already been paid in accordance with the inclusive water system, any behavior or changes that are beyond the company's ability cannot be prevented. It is confirmed that this is a commercial relationship, not a relationship between the ruler and the ruled. We are sending this letter accordingly and request that your association forward it to the company for investigation."</p>

<p>"We would like to inform you that the hundred houses in Yuanfuli on Tangshan Road of this office, the water company has changed to the water meter system since July, and the water fees have increased sharply, with the maximum increase being more than four times. This office did not pay according to the new rates before the water fee issue was resolved. Yesterday, the water company suddenly sent a letter to each tenant, saying that the owner has not paid the water fees and that they would have to stop the water supply. We are particularly writing to inform you that it is now the end of the year, and if the water is cut off, there will be many disputes. Please ask your association to strongly negotiate with the water company and do not use water cut-offs as a threat to avoid more problems. Enclosed are 26 water cut-off slips issued to tenants. Please accept them."</p>

<p>"We are replying to your letter of January 25, in which you stated that the water company is using water cut-offs as a threat because it is not successful in calculating water fees by meter, and has issued leaflets to tenants stating, etc. We have noted everything. It is found that this kind of water fee calculated by meter is several times higher than the inclusive water system, and neither the landlord nor the tenant can afford to pay it. If the water company insists on going its own way, seeking its own benefit without regard to the damage to others, we can only let it be. Although we are extremely unwilling to see the situation escalate, we cannot avoid it. Please inform us of any news at any time."</p>

<p>"We would like to inform you that this company has sent up the water fees twice, originally as a transitional measure, pending the three parties deciding on a new method before following it. However, this sincerity of seeking peace has not been understood by your company, and the checks have been returned twice, which is extremely regrettable. We are even more saddened by the different treatment. This company is in a situation where it is not unwilling, but unable to act. We can only let things develop naturally, but this company cannot bear the responsibility. We are sending this letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate it."</p>

We all hope he can point out a clear path for the people to follow." Duan replied with thanks, saying, "I am a descendant of the Huai Army.

We Anhui people should especially remember this experienced elder and work together for the benefit of the country."

<p>Respected Sirs, the fall of the Northeast shook the whole country. All our countrymen are filled with indignation. In this critical moment of life and death for the nation, Jiang brazenly launched a war, leading troops to Guizhou. We feel deeply ashamed. Our army commander, General Wang, in order to implement the policy of resisting foreign aggression, reorganized his troops and first quelled the internal strife. Fortunately, the war has been pacified and the situation in Guizhou has been stabilized, which is in line with your earnest expectations. Your association's call for peace and your concern for the Guizhou army are deeply appreciated. We hereby attach the latest telegram from General Wang for your review and reassurance. Sincerely yours, The Guizhou Provincial Government and the Twenty-Fifth Army Representatives, Xu Chaoguang and Deng Houfang, respectfully.</p>

<p>(Titles abbreviated) Confidential. Your telegram was received. Regarding the military situation in the western route, Wang Tianxi led three regiments of troops and have passed Huajiang. Wu Jianping requested to return to the organization and Cheng Bo, the division commander, and Hui Zhang have been held responsible to accept the request. They are responsible for suppressing the Panjiang eight prefectures, reorganizing and disbanding troops, and maintaining local stability. As for the military situation in the northern route, Hou Zhixi recovered Zunyi on the宥 day and conquered Tongzi on the儉 day. Division Commander Hou Zidan was assigned to send Ye Peilin's regiment to Songkan to intercept them. Mao Jiang and others fled to Sichuan alone, and the few who did not flee are being reorganized. Division Commander Liao Huaizhong led Yang Zhaozhuo and Jiang Yunqing's two regiments and arrived in Zunyi that day. Orders were given to send a portion of the troops to advance towards Meifeng, preparing to recover the eastern route. As for the southern route, Pi Guangze was sent to lead troops to Dushan to reorganize the remnants and restore transportation in southern Guizhou. Rong Li and Jinzhu are under the responsibility of Zhou Fangren. Only Che Mingyi lingers near 思郎. Only Tongren was occupied by Song bandit Long Wanzhang, whose family members were captured. There is no base. I, Lie, have sent a special letter to invite him to surrender. If he does not comply, it can be easily resolved. Nineteen out of ten parts of the province's military affairs have been settled. It is expected that the military affairs can be concluded within a month and construction can be undertaken.

<p>The new measuring instruments made by the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association have been distributed to rice shops in the north and south of the city and have been implemented since February 1st. However, the first calibration of the new measuring instruments was held on January 5th of this year in the Cuixiu Hall of the City Temple. After more than 500 measuring instruments were calibrated, they were distributed to various shops. According to the industry's report, the number of measuring instruments manufactured was insufficient to meet the demand for distribution. Craftsmen are currently being hired to manufacture them continuously. However, the new measuring instruments have been implemented for several days, and the instruments are not fully suitable. Therefore, the association held a meeting yesterday and decided to re-calibrate the new measuring instruments on the 6th of this month in the main hall of Cuixiu Hall in the City Temple. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures Inspection and the Social Affairs Bureau were invited to send personnel to supervise the calibration. It was also stated that various rice industry groups from the north and south of the city would attend the meeting to supervise the calibration and discuss all matters. Yesterday, a new measuring instrument was sent to the Bureau of Weights and Measures Inspection, with a letter stating: "Respectfully, this morning, Mr. Gu Xin-yi, the chairman of our association, went to your office to visit Section Chief Wu and requested a re-calibration of the 斛. We were granted permission. After deliberation by the industry, it was decided to first send one instrument to your office for calibration and return. It was also decided to hold the meeting on the 6th of this month at 1:00 PM in our Cuixiu Hall, to calibrate all 斛 in accordance with the procedure, so that they can be used immediately. At that time, please send personnel from your office to attend the meeting to supervise, so as to show the importance."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Asks the Central Government for Instructions</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, foreign churches often purchase land in the interior in the name of establishing schools or other charitable institutions. Although this land is purchased by foreigners, its ownership cannot be regarded as the same as the land ownership of Chinese citizens. The Central News Agency reporter visited the Land Bureau yesterday to inquire about the bureau's current regulations for foreigners purchasing Chinese land. According to the person in charge of the bureau, foreign churches purchase more Chinese land within the scope of Shanghai than in other places. According to Chinese and foreign treaties, there are regulations allowing such purchases. Moreover, churches purchase land for charitable purposes. Therefore, when the bureau organized the land deeds in previous years, it also issued land practice certificates to the land purchased by churches, but added a "permanent lease" stamp on the certificate to indicate that the sovereignty of the land still belongs to China and cannot be the same as the ownership of land purchased by Chinese citizens. However, this measure is only of a temporary nature. The bureau has previously submitted a request to the municipal government to formulate new regulations for compliance. It is recently heard that the municipal government has forwarded the request to the central government for instructions, and the central government has also submitted it to the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Finance for discussion, so that it can be forwarded for compliance.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Agreed to Convene Mediation Tomorrow</p>
<p>More than 70 dried goods stores in Shanghai, including Shao Wansheng, laid off more than 120 workers during the lunar New Year. The workers were worried about their livelihoods and were in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Appealing to the Party and Government Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the Dried Goods Industry Union sent representatives Yu Yaoqiu, Huang Jiabang, Gong Yimin, and Shao Wenyu, etc., more than a dozen people in total, carrying a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where they were received by Long Peiyun and Dai Yongchan, two staff members of the Civil Affairs Section. After inquiring about their intentions, they agreed to immediately send personnel to investigate Shao Wansheng and other stores, and to cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the mediation issue. The representatives also went to the Social Affairs Bureau to appeal, where they were received by Peng Zhenqiu, a staff member of the Third Section. He believed that the number of workers laid off in the dried goods industry this time was too large, and it would be quite difficult to handle the mediation separately. He agreed to convene representatives from the Industry Association and the Labor Union to the bureau at 1:00 PM (tomorrow) to mediate according to law, and advised the workers to return to the store and wait for a solution. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Mediation Tomorrow In addition to receiving the petition from the labor side, the Municipal Party Headquarters believes that the capital side of the dried goods industry still follows the old customs of the lunar calendar, laying off workers, which is inappropriate. Therefore, Dai Yongchan was immediately sent by the Civil Affairs Section to Shao Wansheng and other stores to persuade the capital side not to drive the workers out of the store before the issue is resolved, and to continue to provide food and lodging. On the side of the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided to convene representatives from the Dried Goods Industry Association and the Occupational Union, two responsible representatives from each, to the bureau at 1:00 PM tomorrow to wait for mediation, so as to quell the labor unrest.</p>

<p>Feeling the Difficulty of Making a Living by Writing on a Snowy Night</p>
<p>A Whimsical Proposal from a Friend Actually Led to a Trip Around the World</p>
<p>Now Plans to Ask the Panchen Lama for a Passport to Travel to Tibet</p>
<p>According to the Dami Evening Post, a young Viennese novelist, traveler, and adventurer recently arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. His name is Weiss Flach. On the snowy night of February 14, 1928, he was drinking with three or four friends in a wine shop in Vienna. He felt the difficulty of making a living by writing. A friend jokingly suggested, "Why not ride a bicycle around the world to collect good materials for speeches?" Weiss immediately slapped the table and exclaimed, "Excellent! Excellent! This is truly a brilliant plan! I have made up my mind." So, the next morning, he straddled his bicycle and embarked on a long journey through the snow. In the past five years, he has crossed the highest mountains in Europe, traversed the deepest forests in Asia, and crossed the hottest Sahara Desert in the world. He has traveled 46,000 kilometers on his two-wheeled vehicle. When he arrived in Kanpur, India last year, the bicycle was so worn out that he abandoned it and walked or took trains to Shanghai. During the journey, he saw the portraits of the King and Queen of Sweden, and in Finland and Latvia, he went through many twists and turns to obtain the autobiographies of the presidents of the two countries. In Spanish Morocco, he went deep into the chieftain's courtyard and witnessed the exotic dances of the barbarian concubines. After passing through India to Siam, he got lost in the primeval forests for ten days. The servants he hired fled due to the incessant rain, so he ventured alone through the dangers of poisonous snakes and fierce tigers. Finally, he reached a British-operated mine, and was able to return to the civilized world. He recently traveled from Taiwan to Beiping, wanting to ask the Panchen Lama for a passport to travel to Tibet. He then heard that the Panchen Lama was going to Beijing, so he came to Shanghai and will continue to Nanjing to visit the Panchen Lama, hoping to realize his intention to travel to Tibet.</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Pujiang Daily Ship Caused a Disaster <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Ship Was Very Fast and Disregarded Everything</p>
<p>A Coal Ship Sank and a Match Ship Was Also Careless</p>
<p>The following is a report on the incident of a Japanese ship causing a disaster at the mouth of Lujiazui in the Pujiang River, colliding with and sinking a coal ship and drowning a boatman:</p>
<p>Coal Ship Capsized A few days ago, a cargo ship named HakushinMaru, belonging to the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company, came to Shanghai from Tianjin and entered the Pujiang River from Wusong. When it reached the Lujiazui river, the ship took advantage of the fast tide. When driving, the ship disregards the cargo ships in the port. At that time, a civilian ship carrying coal was sailing out of the Pujiang River, facing the Japanese ship. When the Japanese ship approached, the coal ship tried to avoid it, but the Japanese ship was very fast and did not slow down, causing the coal ship to be hit hard, damaging the hull and immediately sinking in the port.</p>
<p>Match Carelessness The force of the Japanese ship's collision was huge. After the coal ship was hit, a small civilian ship transporting matches was also hit by the Japanese ship. The ship was loaded with 900 cases of matches, which fell over due to the impact, causing a fire. The fire was raging for a while, and the matches were even easier to burn. In a short time, 45 cases were destroyed. Fortunately, they tried their best to put out the fire, and were able to put it out with water, avoiding a major disaster. However, part of the hull has been burned.</p>
<p>One Person Drowned After the Japanese ship caused an accident and overturned the coal ship, the boatmen in the ship all fell into the water. Fortunately, nearby small boats and the water patrol police sent boats to rescue them, and the people who fell into the water were rescued, but one boatman had already drowned in the Pujiang River. After the incident occurred, the boatman of the coal ship who was victimized reported the collision to the customs and reported to the cargo owner, preparing to negotiate with the Japanese ship of the Dalian Steamship Company that caused the disaster and seek compensation for various losses.</p>

<p>Her brother insists she was beaten to death by her husband</p>
<p>The judge ordered an autopsy of the body</p>
<p>Xin Zhengshi, a Ningbo woman, aged 27, whose husband, Xin Liyun, worked as a clerk at the Texaco oil depot in Pudong, suffered a miscarriage on the 28th of last month, which led to illness. Her husband sent her to the Ximen Maternity Hospital for treatment, but she returned home for recuperation after a few days. The woman's illness suddenly worsened and she died at home the day before yesterday. The woman's brother, Zheng Zhenglin, believed that his sister did not die of illness, but was beaten and injured to death by her husband, Xin Liyun. Therefore, the day before yesterday, he went to the Xin's home with several companions to argue with him and reported it to the Huishan Police Station, ordering detectives to investigate. They moved the woman's body to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court and requested Prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the morgue to examine the body and hear the case. According to Zheng Zhenglin's testimony, the deceased was his younger sister, and on the first day of the lunar new year, her husband gave the children two yuan in New Year's money, and his sister asked her husband for New Year's money, but he refused, which led to an argument, and he slapped her face and then beat her with fists and feet, causing serious injuries and leading to death. He heard it from the Fan family, a neighbour of the deceased. According to the testimony of the deceased's husband, Xin Liyun, the deceased was his wife, and she died of illness after a miscarriage on the third day of the lunar new year, and there had been no quarrel or fight with her recently. They had a quarrel once in September last year, and requested an examination. Guo Jun said that the truth could only be revealed after an autopsy was performed on the body, so the court ordered an autopsy and rescheduled the hearing for Tuesday next week.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Further Report on the Case of the Anti-Gambling Operations Department Banning a Gambling Den <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Fines of over four hundred yuan were transferred to the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Gambling Den Property Has Already Been Sealed and Gambling is Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, based on a confidential report, new New River Danfeng Road Guanyinge Lane Yunshan Lane No. 16, whether unemployed Shanghai gangsters, secretly opened gambling dens, etc., the authorities said that during the martial law period, hundreds of people gathered every day and all night long to gamble, which was related to local public security, so they sent adjutant Zhang Yusan and others, led a platoon of military police, to arrest them at the address at 9:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month. A large number of gambling and smoking paraphernalia were seized on the spot, and more than 300 male and female criminals were arrested. The situation has been briefly reported in the previous report, and the subsequent situation is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Sentencing of gamblers: After the secret gambling den was raided, all 300 or so gamblers who were arrested, except for the 23 more important ones, were escorted by military police in trucks to the Longhua Headquarters Detention Center for custody. The rest were temporarily guarded by military police downstairs in the gambling den. Until the afternoon of the 2nd, the Garrison Headquarters sent military law officers to the second floor of the gambling den to interrogate the gamblers separately, or fined them four or five yuan, or beat their palms with military sticks several times, as a warning, and then released them all. A total of more than 410 yuan was collected in fines, and it is planned to transfer the money to the Northeast Volunteer Army. After the case is closed, the punishment will be announced. As for the 23 gamblers detained at the Longhua Headquarters, because the circumstances are more serious, they are still being investigated before they are sentenced.</p>
<p>Seizure of the Gambling Property: The gambling den property was sealed off yesterday by personnel from the Garrison Headquarters. Notices were posted on all front and back doors, strictly prohibiting gambling, so that all merchants and others would be informed.</p>
<p>Not much Money was Seized: The previous report stated that tens of thousands of yuan in illegal money was seized from the gambling den. This was a misrepresentation. According to Adjutant Zhang of the Garrison Headquarters, only 119 yuan in silver dollars, 70 jiao in small silver coins, and 27,290 copper coins were seized at the time, as well as four chartered cars and one pistol. However, according to the gambling den's account books, the daily turnover was only three or four hundred yuan, so there could not have been such a large amount of money.</p>

<p>Hua Tam (Chinese Detective) Ma Derong of the Xinzha Police Station, learned that a gang of bandits intended to break into Room 3 of the Huitong Hotel on Yunnan Road at 10:30 the night before last, with the intention of robbing the place. It was learned that a crowd of people were gathering inside to gamble, and the bandits heard about it, so they went to rob the table. He then reported to the police chief, and together with Hua Tanmu Zhao Fuhai, Bao Tan Yang Fei, Hang Falin, and others, they went to wait in secret. Sure enough, three bandits, Lin Guangfu, Chen Fufu, Wang Aqi and others, walked straight into Room 3, and were all arrested by the detectives. A wooden replica of a handgun was found in Lin's sleeve. However, the wooden gun was shaped so realistically that it was impossible to distinguish between true and false. Then, according to Lin and others' confessions, detectives from the French Concession Police Station went to Room 24 of the Renhe Hotel at 495 Gaodi Lane, Xizilaihuo Street, and Room 14 of the nearby Songjiang Hotel, and arrested four accomplices, Jiang Guoliang, Li Zijin, Fu Lin, and Yang Xingsheng.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request for Negotiations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the French Concession's proposed levy of a classified business tax, please promptly stop it. On the 3rd of this month, the Wood and Bamboo Industry Association of this city sent a letter stating that the members Fuxing, Wanfeng, Chengda, Tongxing, Shenru, Lida, Lishang, Dali, Changhou, and Dali, and Yu Taimaosheng Yiji and other companies, have been operating in the French Concession for many years. In addition to paying municipal donations (i.e. police donations), they have never paid other taxes. Unexpectedly, in January of this year, they successively received notices from the French police, stating that they must donate the so-called classified business donation, etc. If they donate according to the regulations immediately, otherwise they will be fined. The members believe that this item has never existed in the past years, and it is also found that in the so-called classified business regulations, our industry is classified as bamboo and wood rigid material. All the equipment in the store must be subject to the control of the French authorities' public officials. Before starting business, we must first request a donation certificate and pay a review fee of ten yuan in foreign currency. Whether or not it is approved is still subject to the approval of the Engineering Bureau before we can start business. The various regulations are very harsh and cannot be tolerated by our industry. If we do not negotiate reasonably and try to cancel it, in the future, members will inevitably be unable to operate in the concession, which will endanger the future of business. There is no limit to this, and recently it has been found that there have been several cases of members being forced and punished by the French police. Therefore, we have no choice but to request your association to cancel the negotiations with the French Engineering Bureau in order to maintain business. To maintain the industry's safety, this is a matter of public interest. According to this, it is found that the business tax in this city has not yet been implemented. I don't know what legal basis the Engineering Bureau's so-called classified business donation is based on. Please transfer a letter to the association for legal prevention and clarify and reply to maintain business. According to this, it is found that the tax rate for business tax in this city has long been approved by your government and has been approved for implementation. Later, after the one-two-eight disaster last year, the city's merchants were devastated and have not yet been approved for implementation of collection. The French Concession is also within the Shanghai area, and now there is a so-called classified business donation, forcing the timber industry to pay it, which is actually destroying the integrity of the city's tax administration. It is reasonable to submit a report and request your government to review it, and give negotiations to prevent it, in order to maintain tax revenue and relieve merchants' difficulties, which is convenient for the public."</p>

<p>Tao Meixiang, a woman from Jiangyin, also known as Jiu Mei, is 15 years old. She has been working as a maidservant at the Ji residence, No. 81 Anle Fang, Penglai Road, in the city. On the afternoon of October 30th, the girl suddenly disappeared. It is suspected that she was lured away by someone and abducted. The girl is petite, with a long, round face, a slightly dark complexion, and her hair has been cut short. She can speak Shanghai and Jiangyin dialects. When she left, she was wearing three layers of cotton-padded jackets, one pair of cotton-padded pants, and a black-grey checkered flannel jacket, dark green "Freedom Cloth" pants, black velvet embroidered cotton shoes, and a blue-grey wool scarf. The Ji residence is searching for her, but in vain. It is said that the Ji residence has always treated this girl very kindly and has stated that if she can be found, she will be sent back to her parents' home. They deeply fear that she has been lured away by bandits, leading to her downfall or wandering aimlessly, which would be regrettable.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Is My View on Suicide Correct? <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Ren Wangyue |</p>
<p>Many readers of this column who are contemplating suicide come to ask you, sir, for answers. And your answers are always these few words: "Suicide is not a thought that those of us with upward aspirations should have. It is the psychology of a cowardly and shameful person." True, of course, your answer is correct! But it cannot be generalized. For suicides that are truly out of necessity, we do not seem to be able to absolutely oppose them. At the very least, they have some considerable value.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of suicides that I do not oppose at all and even approve of: (1) There are people who commit suicide because their bodies are unhealthy and too weak, and they feel that they cannot do anything. They will spend their lives (until death) living a consumptive life of an invalid, without any production for the country. It is better to die. Sir, can you consider this kind of suicide, due to physical reasons, to be shameful? (2) There are also people who commit suicide because they are used by rich people and wealthy young masters, and they live a life of slavery, not eating enough, not dressing warmly, and working tirelessly all day long without rest. Living is more painful than dying. Is it just to come into the world to be used by rich people and wealthy young masters? To resist and break through the dark life of slavery is impossible. They do not have the freedom to live, but everyone has the freedom to die. Although this kind of suicide is the act of a weakling, it is also something done by people with thorough thinking. Sir, what do you think? (3) There are also people who are neurasthenic and feel that everything is painful and depressing. They feel that the world is empty, lonely, and isolated, with few sympathizers, almost none. Looking around, there are only cold shoulders, not a single confidant, not a single understanding and comforting person. They feel that there is no joy in life and are unwilling to live such a lonely and boring life, so they commit suicide without any hesitation, cutting themselves off from the world. Sir, do you think this expression of thorough pessimism has any considerable value?</p>
<p>As for suicides for losing love for a woman, for appearance... of course, I also think that these kinds of suicides have no value at all.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to ask you to answer is that I am about to carry out the third type of suicide. Because my environment is poor, and I have some lofty ambitions, but I don't know how to socialize or flatter people. Sir, what should I do? I hope you can give me a detailed and complete reply. I would be very grateful!</p>
<p>Answer: In our view, all three types of suicide that you approve of should be opposed: Why? As long as a person has a sound mind and thought, even if he is blind, deaf, or lame, he has his own work efficiency, and he has the opportunity to do his best for society. If he wants to commit suicide "because his body is unhealthy and too weak," frankly speaking, most Chinese people would have to commit suicide. Because there are very many Chinese people who are unhealthy. If compared with the physique of Westerners, eight or nine out of ten are "too weak." If we were in this situation, we should pursue the social causes and physiological and hygienic reasons for "unhealthy bodies" and "too much weakness," and fight against them. Even if we sacrifice ourselves for this, we would still leave behind our deeds and experiences for future generations. Compared to his passive suicide, it is truly immeasurable. This is the reason why we oppose the first type of suicide you mentioned. As for slaves of masters, if they cannot bear the suffering and oppression, from the master's point of view, it is best for you to commit suicide, so as not to trouble him. "Freedom" is truly freedom! However, this kind of freedom is only the most "thorough" act of unconditional submission by the slave to the master. If one uses this kind of freedom to defend his own attitude of unconditional submission, then it is a shameless mentality. As for you saying "to resist and break through the dark life of slavery, but it is impossible," why is it impossible? How has he ever "resisted"? How did he plan to "break through" their "dark life of slavery"? Please tell me! You must know that the dark life of slavery is formed by the dark forces of an oppressive society and an unequal society. To break this dark force, one must combine the extremely great and extremely resolute revolutionary forces in society, and accumulate extremely long and extremely valuable struggle experiences, and have an extremely strong and extremely stable war organization to achieve success. Now there is a group of people, perhaps self-proclaimed very intelligent people, who can rattle off many words like equality, freedom, civilization, barbarism, breaking, overthrowing, struggle, etc., as if they are revolutionary heroes and good fighters. However, once they come into contact with the dark forces, they abandon their armor and weapons and flee, drooping their heads and losing their spirits, with no positive spirit at all. If the dark forces were really as easy to break as they imagined, then wouldn't they all have become heroes in history? Let me tell you a story: "In the eighth year of King Wei, Chu sent a large army to attack Qi. The King of Qi sent Chunyu Kun to Zhao to ask for reinforcements, with a hundred gold coins and forty carriages and horses. Chunyu Kun looked up to the sky and laughed loudly, and the strings of his crown broke. The King said, "Is it too little, sir?" Kun said, "How dare I." The King said, "Is there a reason for laughing?" Kun said, "Now I came from the east and saw a man ploughing the field by the road, holding a pig's trotter and a cup of wine, and praying: 'Let the 甌 be full of 篝, let the 汚邪 be full of carts, let the five grains be abundant and ripe, let the 穰穰 be full of the house.' I saw that what he held was small but what he desired was extravagant, so I laughed at him." (Records of the Grand Historian, Biographies of the Knights-Errant) If you want to break through the shackles of slavery, you have to risk your life, and you have to fight this force decisively without yielding, one after another. The master will always have a day to collapse. If you fantasize about the liberation of the slave's status all day long, but dare not engage in a life-and-death struggle with the master, then it is "holding little but desiring much." Day and night, bowing and praying, begging for God's mercy and the master's favor to give you liberation is certainly a foolish and pitiful thought. Even if you commit suicide out of boredom, in the master's eyes, it is just the death of a dog. Good, a useless dog died! Can this be considered freedom? The slave's freedom is won, not given by others: the slave's freedom is the freedom to live, not the freedom to commit suicide. The slave who commits suicide not only cannot escape the dark life in the human world, but even if there is a heaven and hell, he will still be beaten in hell. Because the society of humans and ghosts is the same. If you cannot fight in the human world, then you are still a coward in the underworld, and you will still be a slave to the strong! Haha! If slaves want to commit suicide, we still have to advise them to wait and see! If you think about it calmly, is this kind of suicide "done by people with thorough thinking"? What does "thorough" actually mean? This is the reason why we oppose the second type of suicide you mentioned. "Feeling that everything is painful and depressing," why? "Feeling that the world is empty... there are almost no sympathizers," why? What do you think is not painful? High carriages and fat horses? Abundant food and clothing? Proud wife and beautiful concubines? What do you think is not empty? Becoming an official and reaching the chairman's position? Getting rich and becoming as wealthy as Hardoon? What kind of amazing person do you think you are, and why should anyone sympathize with you? What knowledge and talent do you have that can arouse people's sympathy? Is your speech genius? Is your literature a great creation? Do you have any inventions? Do you have any outstanding and amazing skills? Please ask yourself, and I guarantee you will sweat like rain and return in vain. Sure enough, in the end, the truth came out: you want to commit suicide because you "have a poor environment and some lofty ambitions, but you don't know how to socialize or flatter people." Isn't this the truth? It can be seen that you just can't stand "poverty," and in your view, the reason for this "poverty" is because you "don't know how to socialize or flatter people." This is really a pity in your eyes. Why do you say "don't know how"? If you knew how, wouldn't all the problems be solved? Poverty would be gone, emptiness would be gone, depression would be gone, and naturally you would change from a suicide addict to a lover of life! However, from the social point of view, your not knowing how to flatter people is precisely the happiness of society, because there is one less black sheep in the crowd. If you have this intention, then your suicide would be of no consequence to society. This reply of mine, which is sometimes happy, sometimes angry, and sometimes scolding, may seem inhuman, but in reality, I immediately saw the psychology of a petty-bourgeois intellectual full of the desire to succeed by chance and yet passively disappointed. If I don't break it thoroughly for you, it would be very dangerous. Please think calmly, can any of the three types of suicidal psychology you mentioned escape our previous answer: "Suicide is not a thought that those of us with upward aspirations should have. It is the psychology of a cowardly and shameful person"? If our answer does not satisfy you, please teach us again so that we can discuss it.</p>

Yesterday, it received a reply from the Public Utilities Bureau, approving the exemption of half of the advertising tax. A special notice is hereby given to all schools. Yours sincerely, The second meeting of the Council of this Association resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau requesting the exemption of advertising tax and handling fees for the establishment of schools "approved for establishment" by this city's Education Bureau. It was approved in the reply letter: "Received your letter of December 12, 21st year, requesting the exemption of advertising tax and handling fees for the establishment of schools "approved for establishment" by the Education Bureau. After consultation with the Education Bureau, it is believed that the "approved for establishment" schools, although they are a necessary stage in the process of registration, the quality of their content and whether all proceedings comply with laws and regulations must be gradually examined and evaluated. It is different from the situation of "registered", "trial run" and "improved" schools that are stipulated for tax exemption. It is planned to exempt half of the advertising tax. Schools that have been approved for establishment but delay the registration procedures shall be taxed in accordance with the regulations to show restrictions. Also, the handling fee item should still be charged in accordance with the regulations. The Municipal Government's Order No. 4732 was consulted and approved. This is specially replied to for your information, etc.". This is hereby notified, and I hope you will check it.</p>

<p>The Youyou Football Team will play against Ruckus at 3:00 PM today at Yiyuan Football Field in the First Division match. It is rumored that the two Hong Kong stars, Liu Mao and Li Shiyou, were unable to come with the port team, so their strength is not as strong as expected.

<p>Draw for Competition Order Determined</p>
<p>England in Best Position</p>
<p>(Paris, 2nd) The draw for the Davis Cup tennis European Zone competition was held today. A total of twenty-four countries are participating. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>First Week's Matches　　Second Week's Matches</p>
<p>Greece·······Greece vs. Romania Romania</p>
<p>Monaco······Monaco vs. Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Finland vs. India······Winner of Finland/India vs. Winner of England/Spain England vs. Spain</p>
<p>Belgium vs. Austria·····Winner of Belgium/Austria vs. Winner of Italy/Yugoslavia Italy vs. Yugoslavia</p>

<p>South Africa···········South Africa vs. Switzerland Switzerland</p>
<p>The second half of the competition is tense. The first half tends to be one-sided. The quarter-finals are generally expected to be Czechoslovakia vs. England, but England must face Italy in the semi-finals, so it's hard to say. The second half is tense, with Germany facing Japan in the semi-finals. Australia encounters South Africa, and the outcome is unpredictable. The quarter-finals will be even more noteworthy.</p>

<p>Forty-eight to Forty-two</p>
<p>Jianhua, Lequan, and Xiqing Win by Default</p>
<p>｜Three Class A Games Tonight｜</p>
<p>Last night's match between Zhenru and Huadong in the Chinese basketball hall attracted many spectators. The game started at 6:30 PM, with the Class B match between Quanhei and Jianle as the opener. Quanhei won 38 to 20. The second game, a Class A match between Xiqing and Jianhua, resulted in a default win for Xiqing due to Jianhua's insufficient number of players. The main event was the match between Huadong and Zhenru. At the start, Zhenru showed its prowess, with its forwards being particularly active. Huadong's guards, the Xia brothers, were overwhelmed and struggled to cope. Zhenru took an early lead of 7 to 2. Huadong did not show any weakness and Xia Zeren stepped forward to assist in the attack, which proved to be effective, and the scores gradually narrowed. From then on, the score difference remained within one or two points. Zhenru took the lead, followed by Huadong, creating a tense and exciting situation. Amidst the scramble, Huadong suddenly took the lead with 21 to 19, gaining an advantage. Later, the score reached 26 to 21. Under this advantage, Huadong thought they could win, but Zhenru's five players mobilized and launched a fierce attack, disrupting Huadong's formation and causing them to lose points repeatedly. At the end of the first half, Zhenru took the lead again with 27 to 26. As the second half started, Chen of Huadong scored first, taking the lead with 28 to 27. But from then on, Zhenru went straight up, with smooth sailing. Huadong could not find a way to retaliate and was at a disadvantage. At the maximum score difference, Zhenru was ahead by thirteen points at 45 to 32. Having suffered this heavy blow, Huadong struggled hard, but until the end of the match, Huadong lost by six points, with the final score being 48 to 42. There are a total of five games tonight, starting at 4:40 PM. There will be three Class A games, among which the match between Qingnian and Nanxing is expected to be more spectacular, with Xia Guangru, Chen Tieniu and Ren Jiexing playing, they should be able to have a showdown with Mai Lingyi.

<p>The result became one-sided</p>
<p>The situation was very tense</p>
<p>The Eastern China football team, known as the ever-victorious team in the Western League Class A competition, yesterday won 4-0 cleanly against the Westerners' Club at the baseball field. This victory adds another page to their record book for this season.</p>
<p>Eastern China Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Shanghai Club</p>
<p>Ke Jin, Mole, Stoke, Xuefu, Boqisi, Hentesheng, Ke'erqiao, Jinmubo, Kenaer, Haitelai, Weifu</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Royal Army's Remaining Power Still Exists <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The results of the two teams differed greatly, but the battle situation was tense. Although the Westerners' Club lost, their performance was excellent. Within ninety minutes, they gave Eastern China a deep blow. The team was purely English, and consisted of veteran players. In their glory days, they called themselves the Royal Army. Their left wing, Ke'erqiao, was one of the famous generals in the past. Others, such as Stoke and Xuefu, are also top-notch talents, and Mr. Shi's prestige still exists today. However, due to old age and lack of training, they often feel weak in the final stage of the game, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Ever-Victorious Team Preserves Its Honor <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Eastern China cleanly scored four goals, preserving the honor of being ever-victorious. The four goals came about in different ways. Central defender Feng Yunyou opened his goal-scoring record for this season and scored the first goal, which was a pleasant surprise. Wan Xianghua followed up, thanks to Li Yichen's pass. Chen Jiaqiu struck with a lightning-fast shot, making the third goal. Chen Yutian went solo and broke into the goal, completing the four goals. However, Eastern China remained unscathed despite the fierce attack from the opposing team, which must be attributed to the dedication of the internal personnel. In the last forty-five minutes of the second half, the Shanghai Club's power was at its peak, just like Eastern China's in the first half, but the ending was different, which was due to Eastern China's internal guards being more outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Central Defender Feng Establishes a Remarkable Achievement First <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>When the two armies met, Eastern China's initial attack was unfavorable and they were forced to retreat. Veteran Ke'erqiao used his wit and cleverly crossed the ball. Kenaer and Haitelai were two ambushers waiting for the opportunity to launch an attack. Unexpectedly, Li Ning jumped up and headed the ball out, resolving the danger. Then, he led the army to counterattack. Li Yichen flicked the ball to the right, and Chen Yutian met it with his foot. Chen Jiaqiu did not want the credit and stepped aside. The enemy's eyes were immediately confused. Feng Yunyou had keen eyes and made a decisive decision, sweeping the ball out on the ground, heading towards the lower corner. Ke Jin was unable to stoop down and the ball went straight into the net. More than three thousand spectators applauded and cheered in unison, congratulating Feng's success.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Generals Xiang and Chen Achieve Success Again <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>With the opening of Eastern China's record, the military's morale became stronger. The five generals successively broke into the battle. In less than ten minutes, Feng Yunyou directed the entire army and came from all directions. Li Yichen took the lead, and Chen Jiaqiu responded effectively. The enemies dodged and defended. A ball flew to the left, landing in an empty spot. Wan Xianghua greeted the ball and shot, breaking through the enemy's gate again. Western veteran Ke'erqiao, witnessing his team's successive defeats, was ambitious and sent the ball out. Central defender Boqisi responded in the middle and sent a long ball, with a height difference of about a foot. Wan Xianghua was active on the left flank. Stoke personally came to the rescue. Wan used a feint to lure the tiger away from the mountain, giving a secret signal and passing the ball to the middle. Chen Jiaqiu got up and met the ball, avoided Mole, and went straight for the enemy's goal, completing a miraculous feat. With three goals in hand, the Westerners were successively defeated, and their spirits did not weaken. Ke'erqiao was still tireless, and the three generals in the middle also rushed forward. At that time, Zhou, the goalkeeper, greeted the ball high and low, doing whatever he wanted, and overcoming all kinds of difficulties. In the end, he took the lead with three to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Entire Team Mobilizes to Maintain the Winning Situation <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Changing formations and fighting again, the Westerners were eager for revenge. The three armies advanced together, surrounding from all sides. Eastern China dispatched troops and generals to guard the key points. Li Ning and Guan Xun'an assisted Zhou in defending the goal, while Wu Youliang, Feng Yunyou and Tu Kaiyuan obstructed from all sides. Sometimes the two inside forwards also joined the defensive ranks, while the two wings and the center forward formed a triangle, stationed outside the border to prepare for a counterattack. Sure enough, in less than five minutes, Chen Yutian secretly crossed the river, penetrating deep into the hinterland and scoring a goal on the ground, gaining comfort in a dangerous situation. Eastern China's joy can be imagined. However, the situation was still tense, and the Westerners still had the upper hand, clearly holding a strong aura. When Li Yichen left the game due to injury, the dull situation turned clearer. Eastern China fought against the enemy with a team of ten people, resulting in a balanced situation. Wan Xianghua, Chen Jiaqiu and Chen Hongguang pounced on the enemy's goal repeatedly. Although they did not score, the enemy's momentum gradually faded. In the end, Eastern China regained the glory of the golden age, and their actions were free and unfettered in front of the Westerners' goal. As the battle ended, Eastern China won cleanly by four to zero.</p>

<p>3-2 West Police Led 2-1 in the First Half</p>
<p>Agael Scored Twice in a Row in the Second Half</p>
<p>The West Police and Agael teams played a Class A football match at the racecourse. Both teams were strong and the situation was evenly matched. However, West Police failed to improve in the second half and achieved nothing, while Agael continued to work hard and attacked fiercely. As expected, they scored two goals in a row. Therefore, although the West Police took the lead with two to one in the first half, they still lost 3-2 in the end. Agael's ability to fight more and more bravely was the main reason for their victory.</p>

<p>｜Famous Players Injured or Penalized, Unable to Play｜</p>
<p>｜Result 4-0｜</p>
<p>Kelaito Scored Three Goals Alone</p>
<p>Jinan Football Team's famous players were either injured or penalized, and the talents were scattered, and the line of defense was fragmented, resulting in a downward trend and a sharp decline in strength. At 3 pm yesterday, the Western League Class A football match was played against the French Business Club at Yiyuan. As a result, Jinan lost a total of four goals, and the French Business Club won 4-0. There was no excitement, and there were few spectators. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>French Business</p>
<p>Fulus, Tuodi, Bojiesi, Langge'er, Marsei'er, Qie'aniya, Fage'tuo, Baoshato, Kelaito, Fafan Que, Qiaodun</p>
<p>Jinan</p>
<p>Zhou Darong, Lai Zuorong, Jiang Shan Jing, Yun Feng, Chen Zhenxiang, Deng Hanbao, Wang Nanzhen, Xie Peiming, Mei Hongbao, Zhang Hongrong, Zhong Yongshen</p>
<h3 id="e212">One to Zero in the First Half <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>At 3 pm, referee He Chunhui ordered the mobilization, and the front line began to engage. The French line of defense was solid, and the forwards Kelaito and Baoshato were both meritorious in this Shanghai Port team, and their courage was extraordinary. Jinan had many rising new troops, with relatively advanced skills. About five minutes into the battle, the French Business Club won a goal, which was scored by center forward Kelaito. He galloped back and forth. Jinan repeatedly sent troops to invade the enemy's territory, but their strength was weak. Fortunately, Jiang Shan Jing's formidable power and efforts to resist the enemy averted the disaster. In a melee lasting for 40 minutes, Jinan center forward Mei Hongbao clashed with the opponent's inside guard and was penalized by the referee. Afterwards, Jinan only had ten people to fight, and their strength became even weaker. The French Business Club took the lead with one goal in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Three to Zero in the Second Half <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After a break, the situation became even more relaxed. Jinan's forward was weak and one general was lost, and they were trapped in strict defense, making it difficult to cross the Lei Pond. In five minutes, French Business right inside forward Fafan Que made another contribution. As a result, the French Business military prestige became stronger, and center forward Kelaito became more courageous, sweeping into the enemy camp alone and establishing a new feat. In a short time, Kelaito scored another goal, registering four goals. Having suffered this heavy blow, Jinan had to cheer up and fight with their backs to the city. Zhang Hongrong got the opportunity to attack the goal, and hit the French Business goalkeeper head-on. The goalkeeper was in a hurry and did not know what to do, but God did not bless them, and the ball bounced off the goalkeeper's back and out of the goal. Jinan did not get this ball, which was a pity. As a result, the French Business Club won 4-0.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Chinese Swimming Research Association Opens Heated Swimming Pool <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Will Place Mirrors... Can See Posture</p>
<p>During each summer, there are thousands of people who float and play in the water every day. Such water enthusiasts, in addition to being active for a quarter of the year, can only sigh at the pool when autumn and winter arrive. Beginners often give up halfway, and even those who are proficient in this skill lack continuous practice, making it difficult to improve their results. Swimming enthusiast Yu Binqi and others have spared no effort in promoting swimming. Since they received the support of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Party Department in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) to establish the Chinese Swimming Research Association, it has been four years. Every summer, the association is responsible for free guidance, and as a result, hundreds of people have learned to swim, aiming to arouse the interest of people in society and to seek to popularize this skill. They have also worked hard to remedy the shortcomings of only being limited to the summer, which can be said to be aspiring to succeed. It is heard that they have agreed with Huang Sen, the curator of the Huang Ke Gymnasium, to jointly build a heated swimming pool in the gymnasium to benefit water enthusiasts. Wang Jianxin, a swimming enthusiast, invented mirrors installed in the pool, so that learners can correct their posture and voluntarily perform their movements to increase interest. The pool is currently under construction, and from now on, swimming enthusiasts can be said to have found their place. The association has also invited famous swimmers from Shanghai to join the guidance, guaranteeing that members will learn various styles.

<h3 id="e216">The Zhongzi Group Fought a Bloody Battle, and Youyou Defeated Qingnian <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhongzi Group of the Chinese Association had a dramatic battle, which was between Youyou and Qingnian. They clashed at the football field at 3 o'clock. Although Qingnian is a strong team in Huxi, they did not give way to Youyou. In terms of coordination, they seemed to lack effort. In the first half, Dong Xiaopei opened the scoring and Wang Zhangbao also established a feat. After Youyou scored, they continued to attack. Qingnian's defenders bravely greeted them, but they inevitably made mistakes. In the second half, Da Mao left the field and was replaced by novice Zhu Shengfa, who was quite valiant. He received a long pass from Mao Honggui and entered the penalty area, building another feat. After this, the battle became fierce, and both sides attacked and defended each other, but they did not open the scoring. Youyou won the complete victory with three to zero.</p>

<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Noble and Mean</p>
<p>Wealth and nobility are originally two linked things. When a person becomes noble, their family property will naturally become wealthy. Those who become rich suddenly will gradually become noble. In ancient times, titles and salaries were considered noble, but modern people do not care about this. Those with money are the noble people, the so-called "tycoons" are the noble people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese noble people mostly own real estate in Shanghai, so they can be considered Shanghai citizens. These are the fixed noble people. Shanghai is the transportation hub between the north and the south, east and west, and is a must-pass place for Chinese and foreign noble people. The upper, middle and lower class hotels are filled with thousands of past, future and current aristocratic travelers. These are the mobile noble people. The fixed noble people are the warp, and the mobile noble people are the weft, weaving together to form Shanghai's aristocratic society. When we open our eyes and take a look, we see that everyone coming and going is a noble person.</p>
<p>While there are many noble people in Shanghai, there are also quite a few mean people. The streetwalkers soliciting customers only cost three or four silver dollars a night, and the price can be said to be extremely low. These are still the obvious mean people. Hidden in the dark corners of society, there are still various unexpected mean people, such as "human and animal spectacles," "male prostitutes," and secret shows for people to watch, etc., all of which are special products of the aristocratic society.</p>
<p>The lives of Shanghai people can be worth more than 100,000 yuan (based on life insurance). Poor people who are run over by cars are sometimes only worth twenty or thirty yuan. The difference in the value of Shanghai people is also very considerable!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Overthrow Lethargy <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>｜Make Day into Night｜</p>
<p>Lethargy must be avoided at all costs. When a person becomes deeply lethargic, no matter what they do, they are "lukewarm," and all their energy is nothing more than "getting by." Because people with deep lethargy are not far from death, and they do not know if they will still be alive tomorrow, they are happy to "drink today and get drunk today." Nineteen out of ten ministers and prime ministers in the late Qing Dynasty were from the imperial examination system. By the time they climbed up step by step from being a successful candidate in the imperial examinations to being a member of the Imperial Academy, they were, frankly speaking, qualified to enter the ancestral hall. Asking these old antiques who are approaching the end of their lives to transform China is simply like asking an old lady who cannot leave her room to design 20th-century new clothes. Therefore, in the current National Government, apart from a few founding members of the party-state, there are very few office workers with gray hair and white beards. This is enough to show that to have a politically energetic administration, one should never ask lethargic people to do it.</p>
<p>"The plan for the year lies in the spring, and the plan for the day lies in the morning." These two sentences fully show that we cannot lightly let go of the word "morning." Our normal office hours are from 9 am to 5 pm. In fact, 9 am is already close to noon and there is no such thing as "morning." By the afternoon, the sun is setting in the west, and it is full of "lethargy." Working during these office hours will certainly not produce anything full of "energy." So now I have a suggestion that is ignorant of propriety, which I would like everyone to consider: change the office hours to be from 2 am to 10 am. During these eight hours, it gradually turns from darkness to light, and the importance of "energy" cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>"Lethargy" covers the earth, and everyone is asleep in their dreams. When there is "energy," everyone gets up to work. I think this method may be able to eliminate all the lethargy in society today and generate a thriving atmosphere. If we always muddle through and sleep during the energetic hours and work in lethargy, then don't even think about changing "the old China" into "the young China!"</p>
<h3 id="e220">Confucius Goes Abroad <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Chengyuan</p>
<p>｜Zilu is Confused｜</p>
<p>In the Spring and Autumn Period, Confucius became angry because his philosophy was not being practiced, and in a fit of anger, he wanted to go abroad to live for a few years. If he found an opportunity, he would make a comeback! But although he shouted loudly, his feet were still not moving. In fact, his old man was just venting his anger and putting on a stern face, deliberately moving people's feelings. He also knew how dangerous it was to go abroad! The wind and waves are very big, and the voyage is turbulent. At such an old age, recklessly fighting with the God of the Sea is sure to be like hitting a rock with an egg! It's laughable that Zilu was so foolish that he believed it to be true, as if he would follow the Master abroad, and without him, it would not work! Confucius saw that he was so pitifully confused and did not understand the innate mysteries in his (Confucius') belly, and he sighed and said, "You, you are braver than I am, but you have nothing to draw on!"</p>
<p>From this alone, we can prove that the people of ancient times, apart from the fact that Old Kong was able to act young and smart, most of the rest were extremely simple-minded. Isn't the issue of going abroad a good example? If Zilu were born thousands of years later, and the Master was making a fuss about going abroad, he would have a flash of inspiration and come up with a plan. He could use radio broadcasting to say, "If the Master wants to go abroad, I, You, will not allow it. When the barbarians invade, we will keep him to be used by the country!" Anyway, the Japanese soldiers have not yet attacked Shandong (Lu), and firing a few cannon shells without medicine for the people to eat a few empty glutinous rice balls might win him the title of hero, right?</p>

<p>Hearing Rain at Midnight</p>
<p>The remnants of the night are long and like raindrops, a singing voice breaks the dream and comes from the corner of the house. The sickbed is quiet, the upper floor is entering meditation, and the sound of racing cars and wind call out in the night. It is difficult to share the thousand sorrows with those who have passed away, are there any in the world who can pity this intention? I remember Salome in my life, the moonlight dripping blood to bury her head.</p>
<p>Feelings Written in Sickness</p>
<p>The smell of medicine and the sound of bells depend on each other, can we share the door with you when the rain comes? (Yi Ping is uniquely clear, but in vain) Former friends who were easily angered become more noble in office, and lovers who were relegated to leisure are rare to hear from. The sound of the piano and singing in the courtyard urge sorrow, and the shadow of the flowers should give some comfort. I chat and boast by the plum blossoms, and I have only known a few things in my life.</p>

<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>| What Benefit to the Nation?</p>
<p>In government offices, female employees have the nickname "red flower vase," meaning they lack ability and are merely decorative. However, not all female employees can be tarred with the same brush; some are quite capable. Speaking of ornaments, many women in our cities willingly become ornaments, catering to the pleasures of those who admire them. They are draped in Western silks and satins, masking their natural beauty with excessive powder, perfume, eyebrow pencil, and lipstick for artificial embellishment. Simultaneously, they largely gravitate towards materialistic pleasures. Some willingly sell their bodies, bowing to money and exchanging their flesh for enjoyment. They crave grand Western-style houses, automobiles, pianos, high-heeled shoes, silk stockings, fashionable clothing, luxurious accessories, velvet carpets, delicacies, American flags, Golden Delicious apples, chocolates, wine, and curaçao, frequenting cinemas, dance halls, parks, hotels, and clubs. I ask you, what benefit are such citizens, male or female, to the nation?</p>
<p>Ultimately, should one strive to be a useful person or willingly become a lifeless ornament? If you were to ask anyone, they would all say they want to be useful, but superfluous ornaments abound before our eyes, and some still tread down this path of degradation and ruin. I cannot help but feel boundless sorrow!</p>

<p>Butterfly truly delivers a beautiful performance in "Flower of Freedom," which can be considered her most triumphant and successful work. In all her past films, she seemed somewhat muddled, lacking any truly outstanding qualities. However, in "Flower of Freedom," she deserves our praise.</p>
<p>Here, she plays Jin Yihong, a courtesan and a noblewoman. Naturally, she possesses impeccable Mandarin, charming dimples, expressive eyes, and a graceful figure, truly befitting the name of a genuine courtesan.</p>

<p>"Xiaorong, eat faster! Your bowl of rice is getting cold," Zhang Rongjiu's wife scolded her five-year-old son, urging him to eat his rice and not just the vegetables.</p>
<p>"The snow is so heavy again. How will we get to Brother Tong's place in Qianjinbao later? Someone brought a message yesterday saying he needed to discuss something important with me and that I should definitely go today, but... Who is it?... A knock on the door... Could it be Brother Tong himself?... "</p>
<p>Zhang Rongjiu listened attentively to the knocking sound.</p>
<p>"Brother Tong is too impatient! With such heavy snow and a strong wind, he still comes over... It must be urgent. Listen... the knocking is so hurried..." Zhang Rongjiu's brother said, getting up to open the door.</p>
<p>"Ouch... What are you doing?... Why are you hitting people?... Who is it?... Bastards... That hurts..."</p>
<p>Zhang Rongjiu's brother had barely opened the door when he was struck with a rifle butt. Because the snow and wind were blowing in, he couldn't open his eyes and retreated to the side, cursing as he looked at the people who had hit him. He saw two enemies in yellow uniforms and a Chinese man in plain clothes.</p>
<p>"Damn it, why didn't you open the door faster? If we hit you, what can you do to us? Hurt? Hmph, serves you right!... If you curse again, we'll beat you to death!" The Chinese man in plain clothes pointed at him and shouted.</p>
<p>"..." He didn't dare to reply.</p>
<p>"Go inside! What are you standing here for?"</p>
<p>He didn't even close the door but led them inside. Zhang Rongjiu was already standing at the door, looking outside.</p>
<p>"The Japanese army is going to use this village for combat exercises. You should quickly hide in the ravines of Pingdingshan Mountain. Don't stay here and get shot! Later, Emperor Xuantong will even give you money to reward you handsomely for the use of your land..." the Chinese man said.</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment. Let us finish our meal before we go," Zhang Rongjiu pleaded with a smile.</p>
<p>"Go... Go... No... No..." The two enemies scowled, mimed hitting people with their guns, and mumbled irregular Chinese words. (4)</p>

<p>Modern science is so advanced. The equipment used on the battlefield is truly amazing. For example, dogs are used to scout for the enemy, pigeons are used to deliver letters, and, most remarkably, Germany used pigeons to take photographs during the Great War. The pigeon photography method involved attaching an automatic camera to the pigeon's chest. When the pigeon flew over enemy lines, the camera was activated by the movement of the pigeon's claws, automatically capturing the enemy's position. Therefore, when aircraft were unavailable for reconnaissance, pigeons could be used instead. However, training military pigeons is very difficult.</p>

<p>(1) Kangaroos: Kangaroos, native to Australia and the South Pacific islands, carry their young in a pouch after birth. The pouch contains four nipples, providing the young with food and warmth while protecting them from various external dangers. This is the most peculiar method of child-rearing among mammals.</p>
<p>(2) Surinam Toads: A type of South American toad, the Surinam toad, has brood pouches on the female's back resembling honeycombs. After the female lays her eggs, the male transfers them to the pouches. When the tadpoles are fully developed, they hop out of the pouches one by one.</p>
<p>(3) Sticklebacks: When sticklebacks are about to spawn, the male gathers aquatic plant stems and builds a circular nest in preparation for the female to lay her eggs. This fish lives in cold-water rivers. After the female lays her eggs, the male guards the nest. While the female is away foraging, the male spreads his pectoral fins to protect the eggs and sometimes wags his pectoral fins to flush out dirty water and introduce fresh water into the nest, making this fish the most unique of its kind.</p>
<p>(4) Spider Sacs: The spider's hind legs have a sac that it clings to and refuses to separate from. If someone tries to take the sac, it would rather injure itself and desperately protect it because the sac is filled with eggs.</p>
<p>(5) Potter Wasps: Potter wasps build bottle-shaped nests made of mud on tree branches for raising their young. After the female lays her eggs, both the male and female wasps guard the nest.</p>

Therefore, the gold price did not fluctuate significantly and remained within a short distance range. Later, due to the settlement of the March American dollar at 4375, it reached beyond 8 taels. Furthermore, due to the HSBC's listed exchange rates for British and American currencies remaining unchanged, it reached 88.8 taels. Andar sold the February American dollar at 4375, causing a shift in momentum. However, it was still able to hold at the 8 taels level.

Commodities also came to hedge, and it rose to around 8 taels and 5 mace. Yuan Mao Yong Shangchang sold bars, and Fuyu limited the price to 8 taels and 6 mace to sell, so it could not rise. Yuan Mao Yong Fuyu sold twice more, and it fell to within 8 taels, at 7 taels and 9 mace. The shilling at 0.0625 was difficult to settle, or it would need 1 shilling and 8 pence to be traded. Zhaofeng Chang bought at 8 taels and 4 mace, and Hengyu bought to beyond 8 taels and a half, at 8 taels and 8 mace, because HSBC's listed British and American currencies remained unchanged.

As of the previous day, there were still 2,485 bars remaining in the February account book.</p>
<p>(Advance Buying and Selling is Prohibited) Recently, various firms have been conducting pre-market transactions outside the market, and even disputes have arisen. Therefore, the Gold Exchange issued a notice yesterday to stop this. The original text is as follows: "This exchange has always been based on continuous trading, not competitive trading. Of course, it is not allowed to conduct pre-market transactions before the market opens. This has been notified in the record. However, over time, this has been ignored. Recently, the above situation still exists, leading to mutual disputes when the market opens, and even malpractices of raising and suppressing prices. In the future, all brokers must comply with the regulations and must not accept pre-market trading orders before the market opens, so as to avoid unexpected losses for clients."</p>
<h3 id="e229">Foreign Exchange Mediocre, No Major Changes <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>| Once Tight, Ended Slightly Hard |</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was flat and slightly firm. Initially, because the big bars did not change, the British-American and American-British exchange rates rose slightly. The opening price for British exchange in this city was slightly firm, with the recent offer at 1 shilling 8 pence and 0.0625. New York silver prices also showed no rise or fall. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange suddenly rose by more than 1% and 2%. The bank's private telegram reported a rise of 125, and American cotton also rebounded by more than 10 pounds. Therefore, the American dollar opening price should have loosened. The recent offer was 28 yuan 375. After the opening, the bank immediately traded the February 4375. At one point, it was slightly tight because HSBC's listing price did not change. The shilling at 0.0625 was difficult to settle and required 1 shilling 8 pence. Zhengjin also wanted 4375 for the American dollar, but it was like a flash in the pan. The gold industry came to sell, and although the bank ate it, its appetite was weak. The American dollar once reached 625 for April and 75 for May, but it was not easy to sell off. Afterwards, due to the Central Bank's spot sales, the gold price turned back and became flat. Magali took in the May American dollar at 75. The process had no major changes. The market was unexciting. The closing price was the same as the morning opening price, but if you wanted to settle with the bank, it might need to be tighter at 0.0625. The gold industry sold throughout, with occasional hedging of bars. There was only one transaction for British-American exchange. Magali bought the May American dollar at 6875 and sold the shilling at 125, which was traded with the gold industry. Andar sold, and there was a little bit of buying in addition.

<h3 id="e234">The Difficulty of Working Capital Turnover in Shanghai <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai business community has always relied on the financial sector's lending for the transfer of working capital. This year, money shops are particularly cautious, and they carefully consider the opening of accounts. They refuse to renew accounts that have even the slightest dissatisfaction, and new accounts cannot be easily established unless they are solid and have excellent credit. Therefore, at the time of submitting accounts, each business considers obtaining a money shop account as a precious treasure. This shows the difficulty of working capital turnover in various industries this year.</p>

<p>The Public Debt of the Japanese Invasion of Rehe Returned to Fall by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Many Retail Investors Panicked and Settled</p>
<p>Transactions Were Scattered, Supply Exceeded Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a slight relaxation. Because the Japanese army still had plans for a large-scale attack on Rehe, and the threat of withdrawing from the League of Nations was gradually materializing, the hope for peace was about to vanish. Retail investors in the market panicked again. The initial opening at 18 opened rose by 2 corners, but then gradually became lackluster. Various bonds of the 20-year period were particularly inferior. Most of the sales were for the 11th and 20th bonds. The 20-year rolled bonds were for long-term arbitrage, so the difference between the upper and lower months was limited. The market price fell by 3-5 corners in the first round. In the second round, retail investors sold aggressively, but there were few buyers. Only the 1st, 14th, and 50th bonds had some appetite, but the supply still exceeded demand. The market price continued to fall by 2-3 corners, up to 8-9 corners. Transactions were scattered, and large traders rarely came in or out, because they had risen for several days in a row. Many saw profits and settled, which was an inevitable return. The market price was smaller by several corners to one and a half yuan compared to the previous day. Among them, the salt tax was the most significant, falling by about 1 yuan and 5 corners. The second largest were the 19th Good Arbitration, the 6th Rectification, and the 20th rolled bond, which fell by about 1 yuan. The rest were only down by 3-5 corners. The total volume of transactions was 5,955,000 yuan, of which 5,000 yuan was spot goods. Futures was 1,025,000 yuan for unified tax and 1,250,000 yuan for salt tax. The rest were only several hundred thousand yuan. There was no market in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report (3rd) New York Stock Market, the initial trend was not good, but due to the good railroad report for December, short sellers bought back railroad stocks, and the weakness subsided. Gold mining stocks repeatedly reached peaks, creating new high prices for the year. Regarding the film industry, the director of production for Leidianhua, Saierniek, has resigned in Hollywood. Therefore, the issue of film company mergers is causing quite a stir. Creditors of Paramount Pictures have formed a committee to protect their own rights, and Han Men Zha Pier has been appointed as the liquidator for Leidianhua's Southwest Two Companies.

<p>| The Power of Progress Feels Extremely Weak |</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced a morning rise followed by an afternoon decline. Overseas cotton markets saw a slight increase, strengthening confidence, and bolstering bullish sentiment with significant upward pressure. However, actual demand remained sluggish. Most anticipated a development in yarn sales after the Lantern Festival, encouraging many to take long positions. Nonetheless, the overall environment remained unfavorable.</p>
<p>(Recent Yarn Market Improvement of Three Candareens) The People's Standard yarn market opened higher following the overseas cotton market, with strong investor interest. Prices rose by six to seven candareens across various months. In the afternoon, reports of lackluster actual sales and unfavorable current events led to a sharp decline of three, four, and six candareens across all months. The total trading volume for the day was 13,000 bales. Sales included 700 bales by Hengyi, 750 bales by Dachang, 650 bales by Yuanda, 350 bales by Ruid, 350 bales by Changyu, and 350 bales by Mingde. Purchases included 650 bales by Changfeng, 450 bales by Zhenda, 450 bales by Yiyu, 300 bales by Renfeng, and 350 bales by Tongyu. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Closing Prices and Changes, Open Interest</p>
<p>May 1458 Rise 20 7,750</p>
<p>February 1430 Rise 3 38,850</p>
<p>June 1464 1 14,200</p>
<p>March 1439 3 50,950</p>
<p>July 1468 3 3,450</p>
<p>April 1449 1 41,050</p>
<p>Total 176,250</p>
<p>(Active Clearance of Current Yarn) A total of 866 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices increasing by 2.5 candareens. Shenxin Factory opened with 200 bales, and Tongyi Factory opened with 200 bales. Purchase amounts by various groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 329, Sichuan 10, Guangdong 40, Ningbo 5, Nanyang 5, Fellow Traders 265, Shantou 135, Anqing 2, Xiamen 50, Nanjing 5, Fujian 20.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but later declined. However, U.S. cotton, after falling for four consecutive days, showed a slight rebound of over ten pounds, slightly strengthening confidence. Short covering activities occurred, driving the market higher. Nevertheless, actual demand remained quiet, and factories appeared weary. Moreover, the gold market showed signs of weakness. Future trends will continue to depend on the U.S. and Indian cotton markets.</p>
<p>(Large Quantity of Coarse Cotton Prepared for Delivery) The Zheng Standard cotton market opened higher following the overseas cotton market, with improved investor interest. Prices rose by 2.5 candareens across various months. In the afternoon, news of a large quantity of coarse cotton being delivered this month and reports of increased U.S. cotton acreage caused the market to weaken sharply, falling by three candareens. Distant months were affected, falling by 0.5 to 1.5 candareens. The total trading volume for the day was 37,200 dan. Sales included 1,400 dan by Yukang, 1,600 dan by Shenji, 1,700 dan by Yuanda, 2,500 dan by Dafeng, and 1,700 dan by Yifeng. Purchases included 2,900 dan by Mingde, 2,100 dan by Dachang, 1,600 dan by Yuchang, and 900 dan by Taixing. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton, Changes, Open Interest</p>

<p>July 3305 25 13,200</p>
<p>April 3255 10 98,900</p>
<p>Total 430,200</p>
<p>(Factory Demand Remains Cautious) Current cotton demand remains sluggish. Sources include 500 bales of Yaohua cotton and Shaanxi cotton 31.50. Shenxin Factory imported 200 pieces. Warehoused Taicang cotton 31.50. Zhenxin Factory imported 400 bales to Wuxi.</p>

<p>Since the New Year, there has been very little cottonseed trading. Recently, some shipments from Tongzhou and Chongming arrived, totaling over 1,000 dan, which were traded yesterday. The price remained at $2.70, but due to the current situation, market sentiment is very weak, and prices may decline slightly. This price has been able to hold steady because there is not much inventory in the interior.</p>

<p>| No Certainty in Rural Relief and War Debt Issues |</p>
<p>New York, 3rd Day Telegram, Report on the cotton market for the week: Last week, the cotton market closed on a bullish note, with some selling by short positions. Pressure from the South did not increase. Powerful players appeared to be accumulating, but prices stopped rising. Currently, there is no progress in Congress regarding the issuance of paper money, and there is no certainty about relief and war debt issues. Furthermore, the political situation in Germany is causing pessimism. Sales are occurring in the mainland and the Far East (including Bombay). However, China is buying spot goods in the South when prices fall. News from Washington: Congress recently passed a bill directing President Hoover to provide 350,000 bales of cotton from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics' inventory to the Red Cross and other charitable organizations for clothing the poor. Spring planting preparations have begun. Soil conditions are excellent, but many boll weevils have been found. Industry insiders predict that cotton acreage will increase by 3% to 10%. It is reported that the 619,000 bales of raw cotton stockpiled by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which were previously used as collateral for agricultural loans, have now been approved for this purpose.</p>

<p>Customers Haven't Arrived, Market Movement Must Wait Until After the Lantern Festival</p>
<p>Bargain-Priced Foreign Wheat Affecting Flour and Wheat Markets</p>
<p>(Shanghai South Rice Market Has Abundant Supply but Sluggish Sales) Yesterday's supply came from over 40 firms in Puzhong, with inventory accumulating due to several days of increased supply and slow sales. In addition, retail sales are stagnant. Although wholesale merchants have over 1,000 piculs of goods in warehouses, the market remains weak. Su Tong, Nangang, Qingjiao, and other types of rice continued to fall in price by 20 cents. Although Du Yangjian and Yinyuan are scarce, they are not as tight as the previous day. Therefore, prices have fallen slightly. Factories only released Yangjian, with prices remaining unchanged. Changbang rice from inland rivers could not arrive due to frozen conditions.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North Rice Market Has Stagnant Sales and Falling Prices) Yesterday, over 10 boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. Both white japonica and thin japonica rice sales were sluggish, and the market was down by 22-30 cents. Although there was only a small arrival of thin japonica early rice, retail sales were sluggish and wholesale remained stagnant. Prices also fell by 30 cents. A small amount of Yang Du Jian arrived, and sales were acceptable, with prices down slightly. Port Jian was scarce, Ke Jian was weak, and Yinyuan had few arrivals and slow sales, with prices down by 22-30 cents. White Yuan was weak, with a drop of over 10 cents.</p>
<p>(Passenger Xian Rice Continues to Have Some Sales) The Passenger Xian rice market saw both arrivals and sales were slow. However, both local and outside buyers are willing to deal which is helping maintain the price. However, it will be difficult to see market activity for now, but we expect some activity from buyers after the Lantern Festival. Yesterday, 445 bags of Fuzhou refined Yuan rice were sold at $10.048 to $10.045 per bag. Local dealers also purchased 340 bags of Jiangxi late rice at $9.15 to $8.82. Local dealers exclusively handled 230 bags of Hunan red rice at $8.65 to $8.55.</p>
<p>(Foreign Merchants Hawking No. 1 Saigon Rice) Foreign rice stocks remained stagnant. There was slight interest in the market, but because cargo owners insisted on high prices, most buyers switched to Passenger Xian rice. However, after receiving this news, foreign merchants were actively promoting their products in the market. Yesterday, Yuanli received a telegraph from March/April offering No. 1 Saigon rice at 4.3 yuan. Traders are considering the offer, but there were no transactions that day.</p>
<p>(Soybean Sales Acceptable, Oilcake Sales Showing Activity) The miscellaneous grains market remained quiet. Huangdou Chefang and factories continued to purchase soybeans, with 4 train cars of soybeans traded. Local dealers purchased 2 train cars of Dalian soybeans. The Fuzhou group purchased over 400 bags of Chongming Shayang soybeans. High-quality soybeans are stable, while medium- and low-quality soybeans remain weak. Oilcake sales are showing activity, and prices may rise. Nanjing Gangdou is stable due to continued inquiries. Although there were inquiries about foreign sesame, there were no transactions, but sporadic sales continued and the market remained stable. Raw peanuts are killing higher grade products, and peanuts are firm.</p>
<p>(Flour Market Again Shows Uniform Decline) Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, all months showed a uniform decline. Foreign wheat prices fell by another 10 cents. Since the market opened, actual sales to customers have been exceptionally quiet. All activity was limited to small transactions. Prices in Tianjin were also falling, from $2.90 to $2.80 yesterday. Bargain-priced Australian wheat continued to flood the market. It is reported that foreign firms were offering forward contracts at $3.50, so the future volatility of the market will be unavoidable. As a result, market sentiment became very weak, and prices for all months softened. Small factories also began to withdraw from the market. Although total trading volume was only over 200,000, market sentiment was extremely pessimistic. It is predicted that prices may fall to $1.80 in the near future. As a result, February and March contracts fell by 1.75 cents compared to the previous day, April contracts fell by 1.25 cents, May contracts fell by 1 cent, June contracts fell by 1.5 cents, and July contracts fell by 1.25 cents.</p>
<p>(Wheat Futures Cleared, Little Improvement in Market) Yesterday, trading in wheat futures was extremely quiet in the morning, with only a few transactions in the May contracts. Trading was more active after the market opened in the afternoon, but prices trended lower. The continued offering of Australian wheat at $3.50 kept market sentiment weak. Near-term and distant-term contracts were unstable. Due to foreign wheat, sellers were eager to dispose of the July new wheat contracts. As for the current month, there is a risk that the situation will change if factories do not accept the foreign wheat used for hedging. As a result, this month's contracts fell by 2 cents from the previous day, March contracts fell by 3 cents, April contracts fell by 4 cents, and July contracts fell by 2 cents.</p>
<p>According to Friday's telegram from Chicago, wheat prices fell due to weakness in securities and selling from the East. Total trading volume for the two days was 10 million bushels. The closing prices for the 3rd are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price, Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May Contract 46.750 Down 0.375</p>
<p>July Contract 47.375 Down 0.125</p>
<p>September Contract 48.250 Down 0.125</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat overall, with spot prices slightly lower and the Dutch exchange rate rising. The Public Association's prices were 15 taels 6 qian 7.5 fen for No. 24 raw white sugar, down 2.5 fen, with limited trading. There was no change in No. 18 and No. 20 medium white sugar. No. 8, 9 and 10 Dutch red sugar were slightly firmer. On the foreign side, Changxing offered several hundred bags of No. 16 medium white sugar at 14 taels 7 qian, and Huaxin continued to offer raw red sugar at 14 taels 1 qian. In futures, Lijii and Yihe sold 200 tons and 100 tons of sugar respectively in February-March deliveries, all at 4.2 Dutch currency.

<p>Due to low inventory of dried lily flowers held by the trade, prices were tight as the trade held firm. Yesterday, the price rose by 1-2 taels with less than 100 bags being offered. Top-grade village daylilies were priced at 17 taels, country daylilies were priced at 15 taels 6 qian, and Xuzhou daylilies were priced at 15 taels. At the same time, market prices also followed higher.

<p>Recently, the price of refined antimony has been exceptionally firm. The standard estimated price has reached 270 taels. It is said that the reasons for the price increase are partly due to the Communist bandits ravaging the production areas, resulting in extremely low arrivals, and partly due to the expansion of European sales in the local market, leading to a supply shortage, speculation by hoarding merchants, and monopoly by trading merchants, resulting in a sharp increase of more than 20 taels. It is said that over 20 tons were traded yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Copper and Tin Markets Remain Sluggish <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The "copper" market has been sluggish recently, with extremely little trading. It has been found that the outlets for this commodity are copper coin bureaus and military factories, but these factories have not been making additional purchases recently. As a result, market sentiment is weak and prices are low. Currently, refined copper is estimated at 35 taels and yellow copper at 14 taels. "Tin ingots" were estimated at 95 taels 5 qian for Xiaohong yesterday, 104 taels for Fuzu, and 103 taels for Holland, with secondary grades all down by more than one tael. Aside from the Shaoxing group, there were no other buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e248">What Makes Good Walnuts? <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Walnuts Have a Good Taste, and Are Inexpensive.</p>
<p>"Quality" Walnuts are also known as "Hetao." They are nutritious, sweet, and fragrant, and contain oil. Their outer skin is bitter. Their shells can be used as fuel. They are produced in Tianjin and other places. The standards for goods are generally: (1) large size; (2) white and thin shells; (3) abundant and white kernel; and (4) dry body. The quality of various goods is described below:</p>
<p>Hand-Picked Walnuts: Large and uniform in size, white and thin shells, abundant and dry kernel.</p>
<p>Dongchang Walnuts: Slightly varying in size, slightly thick white shells, abundant and dry kernel.</p>
<p>Changping Walnuts: Varying in size, slightly red and thick shells, abundant and dry kernel.</p>
<p>Pinggu Walnuts: Similar to Changping Walnuts.</p>
<p>Shimen Walnuts: Varying in size, thick shells with kernels embedded, less abundant kernel, dry body.</p>
<p>Haozhou Walnuts: Small in size, white and relatively thin shells, insufficient kernel, relatively soft body.</p>
<p>Dong Walnuts: Varying in size, slightly thick shells, insufficient white kernel, relatively soft body.</p>
<p>Shangluo Walnut Meat: White in color, mostly whole pieces, few fragments, dry body.</p>
<p>Tianjin Walnut Meat: Slightly the same.</p>
<p>Foreign Walnut Meat: Different ways of cracking. Whole kernels ("walnut balls") are the best, followed by halves, and then quarters. Must also be white in color and large in size to be qualified.</p>
<p>"Prevention of Spoilage" During the yellow plum season, those with soft bodies are prone to mold, oiliness, and insect infestation. Walnut meat, lacking the protection of the shell, is even more prone to spoilage. Therefore, during this period, some are stored in cold storage to avoid this issue, but this incurs high external costs. If the goods are low in cost and there is still hope, it can be more cost-effective. However, if there is prospect for high-priced goods, it can also protect the capital.</p>
<p>"Consumption Methods" Remove the shell and skin. (Easy to peel off after soaking in boiling water.) Fry with salt water to make "Salted Walnuts." Make with white sugar to make "Walnut Candy." Both taste delicious. For "Walnut Pastry," mix walnut meat and rock sugar in a small mortar and pound finely. Eat dry or mix with boiling water. Can also be eaten with good Shaoxing wine for a nourishing effect. Alternatively, stuff walnut meat into pitted longans or peeled and pitted black dates. These all have unique flavors. Other uses include pastries, dumplings, etc., all of which require them.</p>
<p>"Medicinal Use" The septum of the walnut (i.e., the layer in the walnut kernel) can be soaked in wine to treat back pain. (Errata) Yesterday's Business Sutra was (4), mistakenly printed as (3). We are correcting it.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Strange Rickshaw Puller (2) (By G.K. Chesterton, Translated by Shi Heng) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>I looked at the man. No ordinary dishonest rickshaw puller could come up with such a certain and unfounded lie. And this man was not a dishonest rickshaw puller. If ever there was a human face that was heavy, simple, humble, with two eyes sticking out like a toad's eyes, if ever there was (in short) a face that possessed all the essence of a human face, it was the face of this hateful and respectable rickshaw puller. I looked up and down the street; an unusual dim light seemed about to cover it. And in an instant, that old devil of skepticism poked his finger at my nerves again. What is certainty? Can anyone be certain of anything? Heavens! Thinking of the hackneyed tone of the skeptic who constantly asks us if we possess a past life. Whether we possess a past life is an exciting question for skepticism about truth. Purely theoretically speaking, what could it be other than a legend or a picture a minute ago? The darkness on the road became thicker. The rickshaw puller quietly recounted to me, from the strange moment I hailed him outside Euston Station, all my gestures, words, complex and consistent actions, how could I know (my skeptical friend would say) that I had not hailed him outside Euston? I was confirming my claim, and he was confirming his claim. He was clearly as honest a man as I was, and one who was doing a more respectable job. In that moment, the universe and the stars shook because of a hair's breadth of imbalance, and the foundations of the universe were moved. But for this very reason I believe in drinking, for this very reason I believe in free will, for this very reason I believe in the fixed nature of virtue, a reason that can only be explained by "saying I don't want to be a madman," I continued to believe that this honest rickshaw puller was wrong, and I repeatedly told him that I had indeed gotten in at the corner of Leicester Square. He began to say with the same certainty and deep innocence, "You were hailing me outside Euston Station, and you said ||"</p>
<p>But at this moment, his posture underwent an amazing transformation, as if he had lit a fire inside like a lamp. "Oh, please forgive me, sir," he said. "Please forgive me, please forgive me. You hired me from Leicester Square. I remember now. Please forgive me." With that, this strange man, with a sharp whistling sound, raised his whip and drove away, spinning the wheels. This whole scene, I dare swear by the flag of the British Empire, is absolutely true.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>As he disappeared into the distance and the mist, I looked at this strange rickshaw puller. I imagined that although this man's face seemed very sincere, perhaps if viewed from behind he possessed an extremely evil devil-like temperament, which I do not know if it is correct. Perhaps he was sent to tempt me, who had defended the stubbornness of certainty in the daytime. But in any case, this event gave me a pleasant feeling of remembering my "sense of reality," although it had fallen for a moment, and stood up again. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e273">Three Wishes for Saving the Country Through Aviation (By He Jiagan) <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Now all sorts of people are shouting various ways to save the country, as if everyone suddenly loves their country. But that's not really the case. It was originally like this, they have been saving the country in this way, but now they are just shouting it out.</p>
<p>So the banker says saving the country through savings, the manuscript seller says saving the country through literature, the painter says saving the country through art, the dancer says saving the country by including it in entertainment, and, according to the tobacco company, smoking General Ma Zhanshan brand cigarettes is also a way to save the country.</p>
<p>These various ways of saving the country, like the previous ones that have already been implemented, will also be implemented in the future, and will definitely not last only five minutes.</p>
<p>Only saving the country through aviation is more unique and deserves a closer look. The future is also difficult to predict, because the people who advocate it are generally not aviators themselves.</p>
<p>Then, we might as well say a few words of hope in advance.</p>
<p>People who read Shanghai newspapers last year probably remember that didn't Suzhou have a team of planes that came to fight? Later, all the others "disappeared", leaving only the plane of the foreign martyr, who was overwhelmed by the Japanese planes and finally shot down, causing his mother to run all the way from America to weep bitterly, and take away a few wreaths. It is said that Guangzhou also had a team that set off, and young ladies embroidered poems on their shirts and gave them to the soldiers to encourage them on their journey. However, unfortunately, it seems that they have not arrived yet.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should state two hopes before the air defense team is established:</p>
<p>1.  Recognize the road clearly,</p>
<p>2.  Fly faster.</p>
<p>There is also a more important point, which is that we are now moving from "non-resistance" to "long-term resistance" and entering a time of "psychological resistance". In reality, we may not necessarily fight foreign countries for a while. At that time, the soldiers' skills are itching, but they have no place to show their heroism. I don't know if they will drop bombs on unarmed people? So we must still trembling state a hope, which is!</p>
<p>3. Don't kill the people!</p>
<h3 id="e274">Snowy Night <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Kan</p>
<p>The cold snow fell, the time was already dusk, and the pedestrians and vehicles on the road could be said to be gone. A black cat in the apartment was dozing off at the foot of my bed. In such cold weather, in principle, a stove should be installed in the room, but this winter, I have not lit a stove. It's not that I am not afraid of the severe cold, but because my old Japanese fire pot met with disaster during the January 28th Shanghai Incident and had long been exposed as a corpse in a field of rubble near Fort Baoshan, Wusong. The tragic state of being smashed to pieces still makes me a little sad when I think about it now. Since then, I haven't bought another stove.</p>
<p>Suffering from rheumatism, I am prone to relapse when it gets cold. Fortunately, I have been doing well recently. Except for pain in my legs, the rest of my body is comfortable as usual. I can't help but thank God for his generosity!</p>
<p>Originally, on such a snowy day, it would be best to sit by the stove, enjoying peanuts with aged Shaoxing wine while whispering sweet nothings with a beautiful young woman. However, such a peaceful blessing is not for me. Although I love both wine and women, the so-called "marten fur coat for wine, golden house for a beauty" dream has not been realized in my whole life. Thinking about it, I can't help but feel a little melancholic!</p>
<p>I always have these wild thoughts, perhaps this is the inferiority of the petty bourgeoisie. My friends often scold me, and I often feel that I shouldn't think like this, but when I'm bored, I can't help but think about these things.</p>
<p>I am indeed too contradictory! Sometimes I curse myself like this. But I am determined not to hide my shortcomings from others. I believe that those who know me will naturally forgive me, and those who don't know me can scold me. To be a well-rounded person is actually quite troublesome. It is better to seek peace of mind, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Night is approaching, and the entire room seems to be immersed in water. It is still snowing heavily outside. I predict that the snowy scenery tomorrow will be even more spectacular. The strong north wind is roaring outside the window, the glass window is trembling frequently, and the faint light waves of the electric lamp cannot reach every dark corner. The cold air is eroding my skin. I am sitting alone, surrounded by a desolate mood. After eating dinner, boredom still occupies my entire heart. After thinking about it, it is better to go to bed and sleep. The clock's hand is still dozing on the number eight, so I spread out the quilt and jump in to pretend to sleep.</p>
<p>Tossing and turning, tossing and turning, the quilt is still as cold as iron. I don't know where the warmth has dissipated to! I had long wanted to "sleep until dawn embracing the void," but who knew that I didn't even have this little bit of luck. It's so cold that I can't even sleep. I'm going to have insomnia again tonight!</p>
<p>Insomnia is extremely detrimental to rheumatism patients. Sure enough, my legs started to hurt again in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The snores of the neighbors on the left and right are sounding proudly, but I still have no sleepiness. I stretch out my head to look at the black cat beside the bed, and it is already sleeping soundly. I can't help but feel a little jealous!</p>

<p>— Ms. Wen Juan</p>
<p>We also followed and stepped into the gate of the Guandi Temple, but it was full of desolation. Only a large well in the center of the courtyard still stood there majestically. Mr. C told us: "According to legend, this well is where Guan Gong of the Three Kingdoms led his army and struck the spring with his sword." Absurd myths are unfounded, but I stared at it in a daze. This clear well water once reflected my face five years ago, and it also reflected the face of another friend. | I bless his soul in heaven! At that time, it was mid-April, a rare holiday. We went out of the city for a walk and came to this place. Because we were thirsty, we drank tea in the tea house here and took a rest. Then we got up and walked around. In the small courtyard to the west, he climbed up a tree for me and broke off two beautiful hydrangea flowers. These complete flowers seemed to be admiring our active lives, opening their eyes and staring at me intently. We felt that being able to take the time to relive a little poetic life in such a tense day was a pleasure that was difficult to express. We promised each other: if we can retire to the countryside in the future, we will re-enact the story of riding a donkey on the lake. So we each recorded the day's travels in our diaries so that we could follow them again in the future. Who knew that leaving this remnant would only increase the material for today's sadness!</p>
<p>After turning around, I felt very bored, so I retreated and saw that the open stone road was still in the same condition as it was then, but all that was left by the roadside was not the lush green of early summer, but only the withered roots of flowers and plants. If the stone road had a memory, it should remember a scene from five years ago – a young man with a resolute expression and heroic spirit, and the image of a cheerful and healthy woman? However, the ruthless stone slab only gave me a cold answer. Its heart had been trampled numb by the violence of the world.</p>
<p>Only the affectionate grass was still shaking its haggard body in the west wind, as if greeting me. Ah, grass! You seem to know my thoughts, so you show your sad face to express sympathy with me? When we first met, you and I were both young, but now! You have been destroyed by the power of nature, and I have been deprived of the life in my life by the waves of the world. But, ah! When your youth is gone, there will be a time to come again; but for me, the dead cannot be resurrected, and the lost youth will never return.</p>
<p>Mr. C saw that I was silent and said, "You don't seem to like this place very much?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's too desolate here."</p>
<p>The two young men looked surprised when they heard my words. They felt that I had always been the person who liked natural scenery the most, so why would I suddenly get tired of it! Who knew that my heart was already locked in sorrow at this time, and I could no longer say words of praise for nature!</p>
<p>But Mr. N shook off my reminiscence with his courageous spirit. He picked up a stone lion.</p>
<p>Only "strength"! Strong strength is the way out of everything, I understood. "Sadness is a sign of weakness. I don't want to settle for being in a weak position!" I thought in my heart, and unknowingly I had arrived at the bus station.</p>
<p>The lake and mountains sent us back on our way with a calm and meaningful smile, and the giant shadow of the long-distance bus broke through all the surrounding darkness. (End)</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>The two of them turned back and walked west, and came to the famous M dance hall.</p>
<p>It was a little early, and the band hadn't taken the stage yet. Only five or six dancers who were probably not very popular had arrived. Two of them were practicing the blues while hugging each other, and the rest were just sitting blankly on their chairs.</p>
<p>The two of them also picked two seats and sat down. He felt that the dancing of the two dancers was quite artistic. He especially appreciated their foot stomping, which was very loud and had a rhythmic tone. So he told her.</p>
<p>"That's because your appreciation is too poor..."</p>
<p>She laughed again. What she meant was that the Chinese were generally neurasthenic and lacked the ability to appreciate. However, the Chinese art world, especially the literary world, puts the cart before the horse. Everyone starts with criticism first. As a result, they either fall into extreme subjective pickiness, or the critics themselves are arrogant, thinking that insulting other people's art can raise their own reputation. They really lack the effort of cultivation. This problem often reveals itself unconsciously in literature. Therefore, in order to achieve this cultivation, one must first start with the work of appreciation. She advised Haiquan to postpone taking a subjective attitude towards all art for the time being, and first take an objective appreciation attitude, and then there would be progress.</p>
<p>However, Haiquan still didn't quite understand, and was only surprised that this Japanese woman had such a deep study of art.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, are you good at dancing?"</p>
<p>"Not good."</p>
<p>He answered frankly. He had been to dance halls with his classmates several times before, but he just dragged his legs and was pulled around by the dancers. He was really afraid that Mrs. Tsuruko would see this ugly state. He decided to just appreciate it tonight.</p>
<p>The music started. Dancers and guests also came one after another. Every time the electric light dimmed, several more guests came. "Mr. Lin, let's have one too."</p>
<p>She pulled his hand, but he just smiled and didn't answer.</p>
<p>"See if she will stand up and pull me hard, that's how she shows her enthusiasm for herself... Ah, the opportunity to hug her has come!"</p>
<p>He was hoping like this. He thought that he would definitely not be a toad this time.</p>
<p>From holding hands to hugging the waist, from hugging the waist to hugging, from hugging to... to... ascending step by step, he thought that the love between the two of them would probably graduate soon.</p>
<p>Embracing the music, he dragged his long legs, which were like two hard bamboo tubes, and let Mrs. Tsuruko pull him around. At this time, his feelings were somewhat like drinking half a catty of aged Shaoxing wine, dizzy.</p>

<h3 id="e277">How to Organize Research <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In the past, this journal has published many articles about the bitterness of life. Several proposals for organization have appeared in the "Clerk Communications" section. Solving common bitterness through common organization is a legitimate path. We see that the current situation in North China is full of unpreparedness and disorganization. Compared with our enemies, it has become an inverse proportion. The reason is that the government organization is unsound, and the people lack a well-organized group to serve as the government's backing and to urge the government to improve the current situation. As a result, the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious. If we want to fulfill our responsibilities to the country, we should first study the issue of organization and experiment with it. Because we firmly believe that there is power in organization. When the masses are organized, they have power. Only then can a well-organized and powerful government be produced, can we resist organized imperialists, and can we save this unprecedented national crisis.</p>
<p>When it comes to the topic of "How to Organize," it seems to have a danger of reaction at first glance. In fact, if it is explained as how to unite, it will not be a problem. "Unity" is an empty noun, and its reality is organization. Unity is the result of organization; in other words, the result of organization is unity. It is not that the Chinese are not united, but because there is no organization. However, in today's China, the national spirit has been declining for a long time, and unity is extremely scattered. If we want to promote it once, we must have long-term training. Therefore, "organization" must have certain steps and must be done step by step in order to have good results. At the same time, we must also understand the difficulty of "organization." We must have great patience and great perseverance to do it in order to succeed. What must be eliminated most is the attitude of "wait and see." Everyone must be able to take responsibility.</p>
<p>To organize a group, to put it briefly, it is nothing more than the following main conditions:</p>
<p>㈠ Have a common goal. If the motive of an organization is based on individuals and seeks the interests of a few people, then the organization itself has no meaning at all. Therefore, in order to become a truly public and powerful group organization, we must first determine a common goal that truly seeks the interests of the public, and then study and formulate a plan for action in accordance with this common goal. Only then can actions tend to be consistent, and the spirit of the organization can be easily expressed.</p>
<p>㈡ Determine the source of economic income. Everyone knows the importance of economy. Many great undertakings have failed due to insufficient economic resources. Group organizations are no exception. Therefore, even if there is a spirit of perseverance and determination to work hard, the lack of economic power will make it difficult to implement concrete plans. Wouldn't it be a fatal flaw? Therefore, the source of economic income must be determined in order to reduce obstacles to progress.</p>
<p>㈢ Have a backbone group. The so-called backbone group is the basic members who can take responsibility in a group organization. Each basic member feels the bitterness of life and dissatisfaction with the status quo, and thus jointly unites into an organization. They have a deep understanding of the organization itself. Using their different environments, they proceed towards a common goal, without impatience, without disappointment, with perseverance and hard work. In this process, a outstanding leader will naturally emerge, overcoming all difficulties, never discouraged, and able to sacrifice oneself to achieve the public. Such as Lenin of Russia, Gandhi of India, and Mussolini of Italy, are such figures.</p>
<p>Although there are other conditions, it is not difficult to organize if the above three principles are met. However, in the current state of China, how should we organize to reform society? We now propose a simple step for reference:</p>
<p>㈠ Firmly establish a position and study the methods to start:</p>
<p>㈡ Initially, a small group should be organized by a few people who are responsible for it, and devote themselves to it with full interest and great perseverance, and prepare for the long term with a long-term vision, as a part of the foundation for future expansion of the organization:</p>
<p>㈢ Establish a step for publishing the plan;</p>
<p>㈣ The period of publicly soliciting members;</p>
<p>㈤ The period of simultaneous public and secret actions;</p>
<p>㈥ Pay attention to practical work and expand publicity period. At this point, it is almost a day when an organization has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>The above six steps are all responsible for the mission of training the people, organizing the people, and educating the people. What those who participate need most is a firm spirit and practical action. The more failures, the more you must try. Only in this way can you gradually restore the people's national spirit and save the Republic of China from extinction!</p>

<h3 id="e278">How to Make Merchants Follow the National Calendar for the New Year? <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>The Problem of Merchants Still Following the Lunar Calendar for the New Year</p>
<p>The decree to abolish the old calendar and adopt the national calendar was issued by the government to the whole country long ago, and several years have passed. However, most merchants mostly regard it as a dead letter and do not comply with it. Take Shanghai, a civilized city, as an example. Although some banks and stores can still close their doors for business during the National Calendar New Year, pretending to be celebrating the New Year, other ordinary stores still open their doors and do business. In fact, how can these stores that have never celebrated the New Year give up their long-inherited New Year customs and neglect rest? Then, since they don't celebrate the National Calendar New Year, they are naturally looking forward to the arrival of the lunar calendar New Year. When their hope is reached, they still close their doors and stop business as usual.</p>
<p>As for our countryside, they especially don't take the National Calendar seriously. No matter which store it is, every National Calendar New Year, they always trade as usual, without any sign of the New Year. But when the lunar calendar New Year arrives, everyone closes their doors in unison and the market stops. When acquaintances meet, they always raise their hands high and shout the slogans "Congratulations" and "Get Rich"! However, if you check their accounts, they are clearly written in the National Calendar year and month! If one corner is like this, it will be difficult to find exceptions elsewhere. This strange state of affairs, where the donkey's head doesn't match the horse's mouth, has become a deformed phenomenon in today's deformed society, with two New Years in a year!</p>
<p>Originally, the people have an absolute obligation to obey national laws and decrees; and the issuance of orders and the following of the law implies prestige. Therefore, if the country's laws and decrees are not implemented, its prestige will be swept away! Now, these merchants who think that the National Calendar is insignificant are always "stuck in the old ways" and do not change their old New Year customs. This is simply treating laws and decrees as trivial things, and regarding prestige as nothing. This gives the country the ridicule of "government orders not leaving the capital," which makes foreigners laugh! Such a lawless behavior that disregards the country's face should not be done by our so-called patriotic merchants! Therefore, it is necessary to follow the National Calendar for the New Year and implement it consistently! Considering the reason why they are unwilling to innovate, it is nothing more than an excuse that it hinders the collection of accounts at the end of the year. According to insiders, "The goods in the store are all purchased from Shanghai, and all transactions are recorded in accounts. The "Dragon Boat Festival," "Mid-Autumn Festival," and "Year-End" three festivals of the lunar calendar are the payment periods, especially the Year-End conclusion is the most important. They must be returned in full and no arrears are allowed. The place where the goods are sold is in the countryside, mostly on credit. The liquidation period is only the Year-End festival. Those people in the countryside all regard the end of the year as an unbreakable rule for repaying debts. They must bring the money to pay only when the end of the year is approaching; otherwise, no matter how hard you try to ask, they will ignore you. Once the National Calendar is followed and the New Year is celebrated earlier, the collection of debts will be even more troublesome. Since there is no income at this time, how can we deal with the Shanghai merchants? Therefore, for the New Year, we can only follow the lunar calendar." From this point of view, they are also clinging to the prevailing customs; therefore, they are getting by and unwilling to make more changes. In fact, if everyone can unanimously respect the National Calendar and wash away the traces of celebrating the lunar calendar New Year, then, when the National Calendar Year-End arrives, the people in the countryside will naturally rush to settle their accounts quickly, and there will be no reason to refuse to pay. You must know that customs can be changed by human effort, the problem is that you don't make an effort to do it! Therefore, the most important thing at present is what methods should be used to smash their stubborn prejudices, so that in the future, there will be hope of following the National Calendar for the New Year!</p>
<p>This issue is related to the overall situation of the country, not a small matter. Therefore, it is specially brought to this journal for public discussion. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the country. I hope you will not hesitate to give your valuable opinions! I will be very happy!</p>

<h3 id="e279">Bucket #62 <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinghui</p>
<p>The Life of a Sweeping Worker in a Cotton Mill</p>
<p>In the weaving workshop of the ×× Cotton Mill, the machines are running, the young sisters are busy with their hands, and the workers are also doing their own work. Bucket #62 said to two sweeping workers:</p>
<p>"Fifty-seven, One hundred and eight, come to my house after noon tomorrow to help me move."</p>
<p>After saying that, he walked to the side. Naturally, what the bucket said is equivalent to giving an order, and not a request: because it is an order, it does not need their answer.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven and One hundred and eight raised their heads and looked at each other, said nothing, and then lowered their heads to sweep the messy thread ends again.</p>
<p>Bucket #62 walked to the side of the two workers again.</p>
<p>"Do you know my house, No. ××, Bolu Lane?" He said to them again; "Moving to No. 20, ×× Fang."</p>
<p>After telling them, he walked away, but immediately turned back and added two sentences: "Did you hear that, don't forget, go after noon tomorrow, don't come to the factory after noon."</p>
<p>× × × × × ×</p>
<p>When leaving work in the evening, Fifty-seven and One hundred and eight met outside the factory, each carrying a lunch box in their hands. Fifty-seven was about to take a rickshaw to Yangshupu Bridge when he saw One hundred and eight and asked first: "Where are you going, One hundred and eight?"</p>
<p>"Songpan Road Vegetable Market, where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go together, I won't take a rickshaw either, I'm going to Yangshupu Bridge, let's discuss tomorrow's business."</p>
<p>"Okay." Saying that, the two people slowly walked east along Yangshupu Road.</p>
<p>"I said don't go." Fifty-seven said.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go either, why help him move!"</p>
<p>"That's what I said. He usually oppresses the workers everywhere, hitting, scolding, fining, he does the most bad things, he is the workers' great enemy!"</p>
<p>"He is a great enemy, I said I won't help him move!"</p>
<p>"Don't move! It's really a mistake to help a running dog move."</p>
<p>"Helping an enemy move, you can't find one in the world!"</p>
<p>"Okay, then definitely don't go!"</p>
<p>"Definitely don't go!"</p>
<p>The matter was discussed. When they arrived at Yangshupu Bridge, Fifty-seven took a fork in Lan Road, One hundred and eight crossed the bridge and continued straight ahead, the two turned their heads and waved their hands far away.</p>
<p>× × × × × ×</p>
<p>Half a day passed again, and the whistle sounded, and the male and female workers of the ×× Cotton Mill ate lunch together. Everyone ate busily, and after a while, the whistle sounded again, and one after another they went back to the workshop to work. Fifty-seven and One hundred and eight were still working as usual in the weaving workshop, but Bucket #62 was not there.</p>
<p>Another half an hour passed. Suddenly, Bucket #62 walked there with a face full of anger. He sat down in the position he sat in every day, and he called Fifty-seven and One hundred and eight over.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you two go! Didn't you hear what I said yesterday? Are your ears growing in your mother's butt?" He scolded as soon as he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>The two people didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Go, come with me, put down the brooms and leave!" After giving the order, he raised his butt to leave.</p>
<p>"Don't go." The two people said together.</p>
<p>Because he didn't make it, Bucket showed his power: "Why don't you go?"</p>
<p>"That's not my business."</p>
<p>"I didn't come here to help people move."</p>
<p>Bucket was so angry that his mouth was buzzing, and he couldn't speak for a while. After a long time, he couldn't help but say angrily:</p>
<p>"Okay, get out of here! If you don't go, it's like killing a pig and I won't eat a hairy pig!"</p>
<p>Although he said that, he didn't go back to help move after all, and sat back in his original seat, staring at the two people working. It looked like he would only relieve his hatred by nailing it into the hearts of the two workers.</p>
<p>× × × × × ×</p>
<p>Four days later, Fifty-seven and One hundred and eight were each fined one dollar, the reason "is that they are skimming the cream of the crop"!</p>
<p>Naturally, it is impossible for them to deal with a bucket alone, but they are so angry that they must do something!</p>
<p>"We must do something!"</p>
<p>"I have a way!"</p>
<p>Two days later, something really happened. All the workers and young sisters in the whole weaving workshop stopped working together to protest against the unreasonable oppression of workers by Bucket #62. In less than an hour, the writing room posted the following notice: "Bucket #62 is not doing his job well, he is ordered to stop working immediately."</p>
