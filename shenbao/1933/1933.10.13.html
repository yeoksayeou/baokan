<h3>蔣電各省主席徵詢改善省政府意見　委員制改省長制自各廳處合署辦起</h3>

<h3>中國化學工業社二十二週紀念專刊　弁言</h3>
<p>— 仰𦰃</p>
<p>王曉籟氏謂轼［以極簡單之組織，小規模之試辦，經過極艱苦之奪鬥，而卒致馳名中外，交相引重，能確實挽回局部外溢之利源者，首推中國化學工業社。］方椒伯氏謂，［方中國化學工業社初創時，外貨之植基於我國者，至深且］</p>
<p>久，非特外人，即國人亦多目笑存之。］</p>
<p>蓋二十二年前方君液仙創立中國化學工業社時，不特助之者甚少，而尼之者阻之者，不乏其人。方君與同社諸君子信心直往，毅然不顧，以鍥而不舍之精神，鼓其邁往無前之氣槪，苦心孤詣，慘澹經營，卒奏今日之成績。作始也簡，將畢也鉅，其成功之由來，豈是偶然，鉅可倖致。蓋無一不由主君積其經騐，運其腦力，養其心血，一本曾湘鄕［大處着眼，小處下手，莫問收穫，但問耕耘］之訓語而來。以視好高務遠，以虚相號召，浮華相徵逐者，詎可同日而語。張公權氏嘗謂，［方君無一分一秒不在用心維其業務。］宜乎其事業穏固，進展神速。其所出之三星牙膏，蚊烟香，幾取日人稱霸於東亞之所謂金鋼石牙粉，猪牌蚊香，味之素等等，拔趙幟而立漢幟者，夫豈偶然哉？</p>
<p>茲值二十二週紀念，方君緬懹旣往願　來茲，發行特刊，余願化學工業，.�</p>
<p>社，今後益注意於製造之精進，成本之低廉，多多出品努力産銷。舉市上一切舶來之品而足以替代之，則年年今日之紀念，當有更巨大之貢獻也。</p>
<h3>大廉價的眞意義</h3>
<p>— 惺公</p>
<p>因爲社會的不景氣，農村經濟瀕於破産，各種商業，都形成蕭條的氣象，於是·［大廉偰］這個名詞，幾於是隨時隨地都可以看到；在都市間最繁榮的區域，有些商店統年都掛着［大廉價］的招牌，然而他們的營業，是依然呈着十分慘澹！我們從這種景象中，可以窺知［大廉價］所給予購買者的刺激，已失却其興奮的效用了。</p>
<p>按照商業的原理，［大廉價］的意義，不僅是要利用一個機會，而推銷其平日過剩的産物，以　劑該公司或商號業務上的經濟周轉；同時，也含有一種最大的目的，就是要使自已的出品，以最有效力的方法，銷行到各都市及鄉鎭間，與每一個家庭或個人都發生關係；使他們對於自已的出品發生良好的印象。</p>
<p>於此，我們應該明白，［大廉價］，雖也是一種廣告作用，但這［廣義的廣告，］而不是［獗狹義的廣告！］假使大廉價而違反這個主要原則時，那麽，那麽，不但是失去了它的功用，同時也就消失了它的價值。</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，是一個守着鐵一般信則的商公司，每年只有一年一度的［大廉價］，平素絶不舉行，所以它的［大廉價］是有意義有價值的大廉價，而不是以［大廉價］爲其［狹義的廣告］作用者，這一點凡是歷屆在該公司大廉價期内購過物品者，都已有深切的認識了。我們很歡迎這種大廉價，社會也很需要這種大廉價。因爲，在這提倡國貨與世界經濟競爭的時期，國貨界這種有意義的發展，是值得我人熱烈同情的呀！</p>
<h3>日新月異的化妝品</h3>
<p>— 顰郎</p>
<p>中國化學工業社的幾種新出品</p>
<p>時代愈演進，人類對於物質上的亨，也愈感迫切的需要，日常的生活，除了衣食住行四大要素之外，當然［用］的問題，也居爲一日不可少之例；即如化妝品一項，也已由奢侈品進而爲日用品了；一般青年男女，他們對於化妝品的選擇，已有了相當的認識，他們知道優美的化妝品，不僅爲帮助美容的恩物，並且也爲衛生必需的日用品了。</p>
<p>自新的化學工業發逹後，我國那些舊時的胭脂宫粉已成了時代的落伍者，歸於自淘汰之列，東西洋的新化妝品，利用其關税恊定的護符，一直傾銷入我國内地，使我國在經濟上增加了一筆鉅大的漏巵，所幸我國有志之士，有鑒於此，也就急起直追，設廠自製，以謀抵制，如中國化學工業社，便是國産化妝品製造廠中一個最前的先鋒。</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，肇創於前清宣統三年，二十餘年來，致力於製造方面，所出各項化妝用品，已不下二百餘種，其最著名者，爲三星牌牙膏與軟質雪花精等品，在國産化妝品中，佔着首屈一指的地位，每年産銷的數額，單三星牙膏一種出品，就有五十萬元以上。</p>
<p>返年以來，化妝品工業在時代的進程中，益呈有日新月異的氣象，該社爲應社會的需求，又創製了-許多高貴的新出品，如今我來摘摘舉數種談談··</p>
<p>（一）芳澤脂　芳澤脂是一種護膚的膏類品，它的原料，是採取植物中的脂膏用化學方法配製而成；與普通粉質的雪花，迥不相同；它的功用，能帮助皮膚的滋養，因其原料中所含成分，與人身的自然脂肪，極相融洽，所以一經敷搽，脂質便爲皮膚所吸收，而融合成一體，不留痕跡。在嚴寒的冬天，於臨睡時搽此膏於面頭及手足各部，可消除膚的枯燥粗糙皺裂諸患，而保其光潤細膩。</p>
<p>（二）時代霜　關於雪花的製造，因時代的進展，日新月異，許多愛好美容的男女，不但要選擇它的質地細膩均匀，並且　於香味的選擇，也很精細。如日合香玫塊香，茉莉香等，都隨各人自已所愛好的心理，而定其選擇標凖，化妝品製造廠，爲了要迎合購買者的心理，所以對於一種新出品的製造，莫不審愼週慮，以冀盡善盡美，中國化學工業社新出的時代霜，在製造時期，曾經過二百三十餘次的試騐，分給一千五百餘人的試用，結果方才採集衆意，而爲最後的審定標凖，所以時代霜的産生，自開始籌製之日起，以至出品日，其中經過的歷程，有一年又五個月之久，這樣愼重的考慮，是爲其他化妝品廠所不能及的，所以，本品的價値，的確是站在時代的最前線，而爲現潮流中一種最適應的美容品咧！</p>
<p>其他的新出品尙多，關於香水類的有天香生髮水，規那保髮水等，關於香粉類的，有天鵝撲面粉，天香爽身粉等，關於香皂類的，有牡丹皂，衛生消毒藥皂等，都是佐妝及衛生的心需品，因爲限於篇幅關係，恕不一一備舉了。</p>
<h3>食補</h3>
<p>— 景行</p>
<p>我國俗諺有謂［藥補不如食補］一語，是則人類病後滋補一層，可以富於營養料之食物替代藥劑·然而厚味油腻，不利消化，於病後食慾反常亢進時，每因饕餐而致復病加劇，殊失攝生之意也。考人體疾病之發生系於營養缺乏，血液新陳代謝機能低退，不足以抵抗病患之襲來者爲最普遍·而於旣病之後其肌膚消瘦，血液枯涸·消化能力薄弱，自爲一般現象，際此之時，自當籌思有以利導之。</p>
<p>考近世醫藥界以磠基酸（ＡｍｉｎｏＡｃｉｄｓ）爲病後滋補之主要原素而製成之藥劑甚夥，按磠基酸係一種蛋白質之最終産物，其間經過人工消化，不待人體内消化器官再施消化作用，服用之後，經過胃壁而直接滋養，然仍嫌服藥與飲食判爲兩事，猶不免麻煩也。</p>
<p>因此最近國内調味品製造業，如中國化學工業社，其所製美味觀音粉美味素味生等，於麥麩原料之中，用化學方法提煉，攝取植物蛋白質，保留其原有强烈之鮮味，亦用人工消化作用，製成含有磠臺酸百分之八十以上之調味品，可以供給體内燃燒之　料，適應體内組織長成之需要，生肌養血，增進食慾，因直接滋養其功效俱神速顯著，竟能融會服藥飲食爲一事，併和藥劑食物於一器緃使素肴清湯，加一少許，旣享美腴，復合滋補，價格又極低廉，當此社會經濟衰落，一般平民購買力不足，及各類藥劑奇昻之時，眞可謂最適宜之補品。</p>
<p>不獨病後需要美味觀音粉美味素味生等經濟補藥，即家庭快樂，全在整個家庭各個分子之康寗强健，則此項補品可以增進營養，增加對付病魔之抵抗力，尤非常備日用不可矣。</p>
<h3>口腔衛生與刷齒劑的選擇</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>牙齒雖然是身體上的一小部份，却操着人類一生幸福的關鍵，而常人每多不加注意，據一位曾在英國軍隊服務的俄國牙科博士葛萊司寇説··［英國的軍人有百分之九十是牙齒腐壤的。］在美國的一個小城市中，據查童齡之學生，患　有病者　竟佔百分之九十五，這是何等驚人的統計啊！以英美人那樣的愛好衛生，患牙疾者猶有如此之多！至於我們中國呢，因歷來缺乏調查，所以很少正確的統計；但據最近南京市健康教育委員會，對於京市實施健康教育檢查的結果，在童齡學生二萬四千餘人中，發現了有病者佔八千餘人，每人平均以三個病牙計，就共有病牙二萬四千餘個。在這個統計中，也許還不能代表中國整個民族的齒病統計，但牙疾之爲人類的普遍病，乃是無可諱言者了！</p>
<p>通常人之視牙齒，僅爲一種帮襯美觀的東西，倘然牙齒一旦發現駐蝕，也以爲是局部問題，與全體健康無關。殊不知齒骨是貫通於神經系的，牙齒有了疾患，可直接影響於智慧。况且人類一身的營養，也完全　牙齒的咀嚼，以輪入胃腸各部，倘然牙齒發現腐壤，則咀嚼的工作减其效用，於是便妨碍腸胃的消化力，而致形成胃病，明以齒牙實司全體健康的　匙，葛萊司寇　喻得最好，他説··［牙齒之於人，猶磨予之於磨坊，磨予倘然不能將粟粒研碎，那麽，籃箕等都只好成爲廢物了！］誠然，食物倘然没有健全的牙齒咀嚼，腸胃也就没有那運化的能力了。</p>
<p>有些人又以爲牙齒的保護，只須注意中年時期，便已盡事，至於初生婴兒及未成年時的乳齒，儘可聽其自然；這又是極端的錯誤！因爲婴兒及未成年時的。齒牙營養，可使乳齒的整齊健全，而乳齒乃是永久齒的基礎，决没有一個乳齒不完整的人，而能産生健全的美的永久齒。我們常看到許多未成年的兒童，生着滿口焦黄的牙齒，甚者，是牙齒腐蝕過半，而爲母親者仍漠然視之，以爲俟乳齒脱落永久齒産生時，就可焕然一新，其實，這眞是太缺乏口腔衛生的常　了！</p>
<p>多數人的理想，以爲每日一度的局部刷牙，這樣便已盡口腔衛生之能事了。豈知這又大　不然；固然刷牙是口腔衛生最好的工作，但是對於牙刷和牙粉牙膏的選擇，以及刷牙時的動作姿勢，都是講究口腔衛生者所必須注意的事！我們曾看到有許多每日刷牙的人，他的牙齒依然是焦黄腐壤，無疑的他是太不注意刷齒劑的選擇，而用了那劣等的牙粉牙膏了。人們應該知道··劣等的牙粉牙膏，是不但殺茵的功效極微，並且足以損及齒面的琺瑯質，這一點，我是必須特别提醒一般購買者的注意。</p>
<p>中國化學工業社所出的三星牙膏，行銷垂二十年，憑着品質的優美，價格的低廉，已爲多數化學家，醫樂家，以及愛好衛生的仕女所一致認爲標準的刷齒劑了··最近又應社會的需要，用最新科學方法創製了白玉牙膏與［白玉牙粉］兩種出品，它的原料是採用［結晶體的特製炭酸鈣］，而配以各種高貴的防腐劑精製而成；這種［結晶體的特製炭酸鈣］，如在顯微鏡下視之，它的粉質均爲一種橢圓形者。（普通的炭酸鈣爲稜角形用以刷牙，不但絶對無損及齒面上的琺瑯質，並且用後可使腔得有　上的快感。在這提倡國貨聲中，我們自已本國有了這樣完美的新出品，確是很足以爲一般愛國同胞所告慰的。</p>
<p>至於刷牙的動作手勢，切忌横刷，因爲這樣的動作，是不能廓清牙齦齦縫中的污垢。所以每次刷牙，其動作的手勢，必須上下直刷而略帶一些螺旋的動作，尤其是白齒的上面，以及全部齒牙的表面，都須擦刷遍到，方能掃除齒𨻶�</p>
<p>爲普通人士的每多忽略，所以特别附帶在此説一説，希望閲者諸君的注意。</p>

<h3>日蘇關係惡化</h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>日自發動九一八以後旣　取南滿一切利益掌握遼吉全部復駸駸乎有飛機占盡北滿侵逼中東路之勢蘇聯感覺應付困難遂發生售路之議冀以换取暫時之和平且不惜一再讓步以遷就日本而日本則得步進步態度依然强硬故當蘇聯提議售路之初一般人即以爲此舉甚屬不智一則徒然引起日本更大之野心再則恐墮入日人詭謀增高傀儡國之地位拖延時日之效未見而反促成其武力奪路之舉也然而蘇聯之意以爲就經濟情勢論中東路旣不免南滿路之威脅又遇吉會路平行線之　制所僅存者惟歐亞聯絡之任務而滿洲傀儡又常借日軍之力藉口剿匪從事運兵致中東路不能執行其尋常業務不如出賣之爲愈特不料日人之必欲無代價而入於其手也。</p>
<p>夫日人之所以敢於如是冒險唆使傀儡進行奪路而不慮蘇聯之反攻者何耶第一日本軍國主義者自挑動瀋陽事變以後深知歐美列强絶對無力東顧同時亦深知英法國憂慮蘇聯之日趨强大日本如出而與蘇聯爲難當能博得列國之同情第二日本之退出國際聯盟原爲焦土外交必然之結果。但亦確知英美對日僅能爲外交上口頭之非難必不有實際的行動而大陸方面犬牙相錯利害衝突最甚之蘇聯第一次五年計劃雖已完成。而二次計劃尙在開始實力未充决不肯輕易發難第三軍國主義之愛國狂熱原屬一時之剌激其内在性質有如嗎啡之注射僅能麻醉興奮於一時一旦藥性過去則頽廢之狀較前更甚日本今已陷入深刻之經濟之恐慌設令長此空呼非常時期而無實際的戰爭出現則日閥將無力以運用軍權故發動戰爭愈早。日本自以爲勝利之成分愈多此所以迭向蘇聯挑戰也。</p>
<p>現在之關鍵在乎蘇聯是否挺身出而應戰吾人僅就現狀論。如蘇聯公佈日僞謀奪中東路之秘密文件與蘇聯各報紙對日僞之極力抨擊態度似已突變大有戰爭前夕之感且貝加爾至沿海省一帶駐兵陡見增加據日方調查謂其數超過十五萬而海參威附近所建築之飛行塲有飛機數百架其中爆擊轟炸機數不下五十而在日本方面增設駐滿常備師團又借熊本第六師團换防之名。復抽調勁旅其第一師團第四師團皆奉調遣次第開入東北境内意在對蘇當無疑義故以表面觀之日蘇關係之緊張已逹極度矣然而呀</p>
<p>緊張雖極緊張時機則尙未到蓋在今日蘇聯尙未肯輕易放棄其和平政策。且今日之戰非單純兩國問題而關於世界各國之行動故目前雖風已滿樓而山雨之來殆尙有待也。</p>

<h3>若槻聲明擁護海軍公約日政界另起大衝動　倫敦條約省日四萬萬元負擔海軍省則認海軍軍縮爲失敗</h3>
<p>（東京）　民政黨總裁若槻在名古屋黨大會發表其關於倫敦海軍軍縮條約之聲明晝、現聞其内容大致謂、余曾代表日本訂立倫敦海軍條約、其目的在國家之大計、余對此信念現在亦無變更、日本國民因此條約、自昭和五年至昭和十一年之間、免除四萬萬圓左右負擔、日與美國競爭、欲勝過美國之强力、在經濟上觀之實屬困難、其所要經費逹幾萬萬圓、不能豫測、今日急要軍備之廣張、與倫敦條約毫無關係也、（十二日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本高唱非常時局以來、海軍軍　之擴張、因被倫敦海軍條約所束縛、世間對於倫敦條約非難之聲漸次高大、民政黨若槻總裁抛棄其沉黩態度、以當時日本全權之資格、　世上發表關於倫敦條約之所信、此事對於政界各方面與以重大感動、即最近五一五事件、被告在法庭之陳述、均高唱依倫敦條約國防之缺陷、非難當時政府所採處置、而世間一部人亦擬承認此主張之時際、若槻總裁突然斷言並無干犯統師權事實、其對於政界之影響重大、前途頗堪注目、（十二日日聯電）</p>
<h3>海軍省之批評</h3>
<p>（東京）　海軍當局批評若槻民政黨總裁對於倫敦條約之辨明如下、槻若槻男之辨明、大體可以肯定、當時日本所主張三原則、即（一）對美總括的七成（二）大巡洋艦七成、（三）瀂水艦現有勢力七萬七千八百噸保持、其中着重第一項之對美總括的七成、而輕視第三項之潜水艦可謂認識不足、因將條約締結當時現有兵力之潜水艦七萬七千八百噸、削减二萬五千噸改爲五萬二千八百噸、與美國同率、致使日本於太平洋作戰上立於不利之地、結果致有第一第二補充計晝、並非僅如若槻男所云、因最近國際情勢化而發生者、即統帥權于犯問題亦然、然海軍方面、並不欲如數死兒之齡、惟當表明意見、須舉國一致、準備應付將來云、（十二日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　若槻總裁在名古屋之演説談及倫敦海軍條約　海軍省因其演説對於時局有影響、特發表如次非公式意見、以今日時勢觀察、倫敦條約榷係失敗、若槻總裁雖自稱成功、然八吋口徑砲巡洋艦與潛水艦問題條約、與日本之主張大有懸隔　因此至今不得不實行大規模之補充計劃、以補其缺點、又各種軍艦之近代化及航空隊之充實等國防經費　大有增加　、若槻總裁解釋倫敦條約第十八條不確　蓋若槻氏謂美國於一九三六年夏季以前、造成八吋吕徑砲巡洋艦十五艘、然於實際美國可以造成十六艘、故日美海軍之比　爲十比六、較現在更爲低下、（十二日日聯電）</p>
<p>政友會之反駁</p>
<p>（東京）　若槻民政黨總裁在名古屋發表、</p>
<p>關於倫敦海軍條約之意見、政友會昨以政務調查會國防部長内田信也之名、發表論駁聲明如下、（一）若槻男於倫敦會議開會之際、在英皇之御前、謂［日本所關心者、在　國民之國家安全感不發生動搖、］然今日事實、國民之安全感已有動搖、（二）力述主力艦代艦建造延期之功績、然此係英美預備會議所内定者、（三）軍令部曾發表八吋砲巡洋艦不能讓步到對美七成以下、然竟决定爲大成强、有傷國民之安全感　且若槻男關於條約之解釋亦有錯誤、（四）關於潛水艦、謂雖有美國之全廢主義、然卒能保持與持與英美同率之五萬二千八百噸、是深以彼方所不用者、與我方所最有用者、爲同率而可喜、殊屬錯誤之甚、（五）統帥權干問題、濱口首相在議會曾卙酌軍部之意向、又軍令部長表明於退職之際、未能完畢輔弼之責爲遺憾、此明係干犯之事實、（十二日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　政友會由首腦部　審議之結果、决定反駁若槻民政黨總裁關於倫敦條約之所論、而表明政友會態度、即以國防部長内田之名義、發表反駁聲明晝、其用意根基於旣往事實、是正若槻之誤謬、至訂立條約之若槻責任問題、暫時不問、然若槻旣然以一黨總裁之資格、公然明言其所信、則政友會鈴木總裁亦於適當時期、、有公然反駁其論説之必要、鈴木之此項演説、將於十日舉行之關東大會或東北大會爲之、最近政友民政兩黨熱心努力之政黨聯合運動、因此不免受打擊而致停頓、（十二日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　民政黨因若槻裁之演説、目的在於掃除世間對於、倫敦條約之誤解、而並非對於政友會爲挑戰者、故政友會雖發表反駁聲明晝、决定暫守沉默、靜觀政界之經過、（十二日日聯社電）</p>

<p>（東京）　今日外務省發言人對記者談話時、未表示關於日昨東京塔斯通訊社記者於檢查時所作之解釋、是否滿意、但稱廣田外相現正在考慮應採取何種辦法、或者［暫時］不能决定云、有以日政府將以何種訓令致駐俄日使太田、及在訓令發出前、是否將徵求日内閣之同意爲問者、但彼均答以現正在考慮中、該發言人表、　東京塔斯通訊社記者、在所謂菱刈大將文件已被否認眞確後、仍行發表、致激起當軸者之憤怒、故對該記者此種舉動、由政治立塲及技術立塲、均應有考慮之必要、至於蘇俄此次發表此種文件事、日政府决單獨處理、不與出售中東路會議相混合云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　蘇俄　露所謂日本之北滿陰謀、故意中　日本之地位　關於該項對策、當經外務省信軍部聯絡内務方面討議之下、聞其所取之態度决定如左（一）此次蘇俄突然中傷日本、要係蘇俄政府未曾認識北滿局勢之眞相所致、其行爲有捐日本國家之威嚴、須要求取消並表示道歉、而恢復日本在國際外交上所蒙之捐失、（二）倘蘇俄政府肯承認日本方面之要求、則日本方面爲逹到此項目計當採取斷然之手段、（三）在東京之塔斯通信員關於其行爲、外務省未便决定、當由内務省以國内法律問題處置之、倘該通信員有違法行爲、則以國法處之、否則當不加以任何懲戒云、（十二日日聯電）</p>
<h3>俄僞買路交涉僵境</h3>
<p>（東京）　俄［滿］中東路買賣會議將因蘇俄發表所謂菱刈致東京報告之結果而陷於危境、日本謂［滿洲國］所施關於中東路之計劃與東京之鐵路會議毫不相關、蘇俄則稱二事不能相分　故拒絶與［滿］續開會議局勢苟無轉機、則日本似將卸却爲雙方調停之任務、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>俄報評述　文件眞僞寗容爭辯日本窘態顯已畢露</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯政府公報［伊斯維斯太］報關於日本報紙之初次回響、作如下評述［當塔斯通訊社發表日本官方之文件後、日本報界即云此等文件爲僞造　此　企圖不僅可笑、且僅能表示關係各方之竭度窘態、已被公佈之報告之著者、即滿洲日軍總司令菱刈大將及日本駐哈總領森田絶未急急出爲否認、此等報告之眞實性、彼等顯已處於窘境、而靜待上峯之訓令也、日本報界之評論以及外交部代言人最近向報界之談話、均得證明此等文件之不容爭辯、同時表示此等文件所引起之印象爲何等深刻、塔斯社所發表之一部分日本文件、暴露在滿日本當局在東京直接指令之下、所進行之侵略工作而此項公佈實又鄭重表示蘇聯政府凖備衛蘇聯　利與利益之堅决態度云、（十一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>美軍家言　俄養精蓄鋭無西顧憂遠東地位確較前鞏固</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間認日俄中東路爭執及莫斯科發表文件、欲以暴露日本　路野心等舉動、可視爲蘇俄在西境締結不侵犯條約後、自覺遠東地位、較前鞏固之明徵、美國務院内對於日俄爭執、雖不願加以評論、其他官塲則稱、蘇俄殆在數月前早已料及遠東之糾紛故在歐洲方面趕急締結不侵犯條約、熟悉遠東情形之某君、更</p>
<p>謂蘇俄致西境之安全、顯在遠東鳴其佩刀之心、惟此問認時局猶不甚嚴重、因軍事專家逆料日本或俄國、當無有願在隆冬起　者、更有數人、則信日俄此時俱無實在衛突意、如某軍事家則稱、蘇俄在遠東軍事地位、目下猶未克作大　模戰爭　因西伯利亞所駐俄軍、人數尙不衆、一日開　後、俄人勢須在世界最長鐵路之終點、從事防守也、美國報紙則對於蘇俄所稱及日本否認各節、同樣注意、三數評論記者預料前途將有嚴重糾紛云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>日美締公斷約</h3>
<p>日海軍省之反對理由</p>
<p>（東京）　石井與羅斯福大總統間、擬締結日美仲裁條約　使日美間不致發生戰事、因此廣田外相於九日與石井子會見、當時、尤其聽取石井對於此點之意見於五相會議時亦曾陳述該條約之意見豈知與大角海相所懹抱　海軍方面之主張相反、故海軍方面之對美方針與陸軍方面之對俄方針　同被目爲五相會議之難關　因此十六日之五相會議、意見恐仍不能一致和、故其將來頗堪注意至於海軍方面之意見、大體如下（一）所謂仲裁裁判條約、亦即所謂不侵犯條約、總之、日美問必須互相尊敬、如今國防力量有異、國民失却安全之際、若爲形式的不戰　實毫無意味（一）不能因日美之和平工作　　低充實海軍軍備之　度、（一）日美間若發生戰禍其原因爲［滿］國承認問題·海軍力比率問題、及南洋委任統治等問題此類問題若不解决、不能僅締結抽象的和平條約、（一）又該問題在美國似爲比較的不重要、而在日本則爲死活問題、如締結和平條約、而事態爲不得已須訴諸非手段、則日本反蒙破壤條約之污名云、（十一日電通電）</p>
<h3>保障安全　石井進言廣田和美美日開戰兩敗俱傷</h3>
<p>（東京）　據東報載稱　石井子爵自倫敦經濟會議回國、九日晨抵東京後即日往訪　藤首相與廣田外相、除報告經濟會議經過外　並對政府進言重大外交政策、石井留美時痛感美國上下對日感情日趨惡化　曾非正式對羅斯福總統提　美日訂公斷條約、爾後美日間雖未再言及此事、但廣田外相任新職以來、亦深慮日美關係之逐漸嚴重化爲預防一九三五年至六年之下屆裁軍會議時、避免與美正面衝突計、須在事前與美作安全保障恊定、故石井子進言、甚動廣田之心、又據石井之言、日美若戰、世界必陷於未曾有之混亂、其慘禍未可設想、日美兩國亦無論勝敗　總不得避免龍虎俱倒、又如果日美宣戰、日軍若欲攻美、須渡太平洋、美軍亦要如此、此種航程過萬里後、始能接火之戰爭、前車之　可　、日美皆必不出此愚策、相互僅能以　逐艦攻擊對方商船戰爭時期、即不得遷延、使介於此間之第三國得漁翁之利、結果日美俱敗、以此理由、石井勸廣田積極向美求平和以免同時與俄關戰云、（華聯社通訊）</p>
<h3>英保守派　疑忌蘇聯顧慮日本始終抱定放任政策</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　此間若干保守派報紙漠視蘇俄所指日本陰　　奪中東路之文件、而皆刊載日政府之否認、此等報紙向抱擁護政府政策、故已引起外間無數評論、甚有若干通訊員詢問政府發言人、該報此舉是否受英政府之影響、官場當然譏笑此等疑慮、於是一般意見、遂以爲大多數保守派報紙、殆信蘇俄所發表者出於僞造、且聞至少有一家、已深信此項文件爲蘇俄所僞造、此外又有數家向來密切注意日俄爭執之報紙、則謂此時蘇俄之忙於内政、與日本之財政地位、俱使實際戰爭、有未必能發生之勢、惟日軍閥在政府中勢力日雄殊使時局難於逆覩耳、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>施肇基對路透記者談話　希望英國覺悟　謂對日放任將危及印度地位主張舉行對華國際會議</h3>
<p>（倫郭）　駐美華使肇基博士明日將由此起程回任、今日語路透訪員、謂列强現皆在華施行放任政策、尤以英國爲甚、英國在中國有甚大之利益、而又與華人久相親睦今其政策實與此相背、博士又極言遠東事務與全世界有急迫之關係、他日歐事較定時、當舉行一對華國際會議、尤當注意上海之前途、因今日日本所處之地位、此舉有絶對之必要、列强對於日本地位固不相同、然島國欲抗拒列强之共同態度、其勢實　可能、渠敢謂印度領袖現亦密切注視英國在華所施之政策、印人皆堅决排日、渠意英國如在華對日讓步、則將有至惡劣之影響及於英國在印所施之政策與其將來之地位、施博士末謂中國切望英國將其駐華公使升格爲大使、猶憶一九二八年美國曾擬出此、徒惜當時英國不能繼之而起　故其議遂寢、惟渠今夏與羅斯福總統談話時、窺其語氣美國似將於今冬復提該問題云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>法報觀察　日俄問題幕後複雜運用外交衝突可免</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　時報以專文論遠東時局、謂［若干國家尤其爲英美兩國對於遠東均勢之打破、不能漠不關心、此等國家不能使世界某一部分範圍之内、某種勢力獨居優越地位、而使各該國利益受其威脅此種情形、日本當能了然現在發生者爲日俄問題但在此問題之幕後、或尙有較爲廣汎較爲複雜之太平洋問題存在、有人謂世界外交問題、其困難固有更甚於目下之中東路問題者　然以外交運用得宜、亦曾得到微妙之解决辦法　以此推之則日俄之衝突　或可藉靈活之外手段以避免之亦未可知、此言固誠可信、第吾人對於日俄國交、終應予以注意且國際人士在若干程度之内、所以愛心如擣者、吾人可於莫斯科與東京方面之煩燥得到解釋］云云（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　各報對於日俄衝突　極爲注意、咸以爲兩國國交、現在雖甚緊張在敵對行爲或可避免　各報又謂德國欲乘日俄曝</p>
<p>兩國　交破裂　以收漁人之利、［日報］謂莫斯科確欲避免衝突、俄國對於戰爭極行恐懼　而日本亦未必出此冒險之舉可見日本與蘇俄　在外交上或將激烈競爭、但由競爭而至破裂、可望避免［小日報］謂、蘇俄政府爲保全自身生存計、在長時期之内尙須雜持和平、决不聽信德國之陰謀、以致危及和平、蓋遠在東陲之中東路、在俄國本無重大價値、俄國不能因保全此路而危及和平也（十二日哈瓦期電）</p>

<h3>軍縮又生波折　英美法拒德整軍</h3>
<p>（柏林）　日内瓦又有意外之發展、英法已商妥共拒德國之要求、故德代表那度尼與英代表西門不得不重行交换意見、明日二代表尙須會談、德國各報因以有勸政府與德代表鎮靜自處、並當勿忘意國現仍取旁觀態度、刻在羅馬進行之討論、亦甚重要、觀於各大國在日内瓦之特别談話、彼等並未如外傳之意見一致云、有抨擊英國之態度者、謂伊拉克近尙許其有置軍用飛機之權、何獨對德靳而不予云、衆意羅馬對於此事尙將發表意見、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日前各方所望國聯能打開軍縮會議僵局之希望、今似已又歸諸泡影、蓋英美法三國會議、聞已决定一致拒絶德國增加軍備之要求也、據自英國方而傳出之消息、三國代表團均覺德國自　近革新運動成功之後、局面已根本更易、若軍縮會議不從事减縮軍備、而反允許德國恢復軍備、恐難以爲世界與論諒解云、若此傳聞果證實　則不管宣告軍縮會議之破裂也、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫郭）　正誼晚報載德外長牛賴特一文、力關外報所傳德國新革命　已引起軍縮新局勢、各國不得不以嚴峻手段對德之説、並謂德國對於軍縮必須主張各國履行彼等之義務、實現此點實爲軍縮會議唯一之希望、德國之建議、爲各國各種軍備當减至與凡爾賽和約規定之德國軍備相同、此爲解决問題最簡單之方法、但各國拒絶考慮德國之現局、法國復率意規定侵略的與防衛的武器、以求自利、俾得保持所有之侵略的武器、德國處此情勢之下、以爲責當自衛、蓋德國之應要求安全、固與他國同也、德國毫無猶預接受英相麥唐納之安全計劃、但不能屈從處武裝世界中而無自衛之道、德國願使其軍備受其期限的監管、而以此項監管須同施於各國爲條約、但德國無論如何、不能接受一方面的監管、此實等於延長戰後之凌辱政策、此種政策、現遭德意志全國一致之反對、必歸失敗云云、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯會第十四屆大會業閉幕、惟此次大會、即在末散會期間以内、一般人精神亦均集中於軍縮會議重行開會以前之初步談話、本日各方談話次數頗多、下午三時、法代表彭古與美代表台維斯曾經會晤、旋又與軍縮會議意大利代表蘇拉尼亞會晤、英代表西門亦曾與　代表蘇拉尼亞接洽、最後法英美三國代表又相聚談話、由下午三時起至四時半始止、此事係某一方面無意説出然關係重大本國代表所談者爲軍縮問題　無任何公報發表、惟正式方面稱三國代表均反對重整軍備　英外相西門於談話之後、往晤軍縮會議主席漢德森氏、各代表對於談話雖極守緘狀、但一般印象顯似滿意、德國代辦對英政府口頭答復所引起之憂慮、已涣然冰釋、而英美法意四國之聯合、更爲確定、意大利表蘇拉尼亞並親口謂意大利與英法美各國之意見相同、即關於談判之内容、亦極接近、以故由現在起所當商議者爲軍縮會議中所當採取之程序、有若干原則德國若不先行承認、則以後討論便爲徒然、現所未决者、惟將來開會時是否宜於先請德國、對于此種原則公開並確切表示其意見、而不先討論業經修改之英國軍縮計費、若德國對此項原則不予承認　則軍縮會議對於該會之命運、究應採取若何態度英美法意四國代表、即應預先商定一種决議案、以確定之、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英日絲業競爭　日人善於模仿侵奪英國市塲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　工業聯合會發表絲業競爭、對於英國絲業所發生極其惡劣之影響謂日本工業家前此僅製造純粹東方式之絲織品、最近兩三年以來、乃又模仿歐洲製造品、對於英國絲業素所擅長之品、如［中國綢］·絲圍巾·絲手帕之類、模仿尤力、而其工作情形（指工　及工作時間）絶非英國所能競爭實業聯合會有鑒於此、乃一致議决迫切要求政府對於日本輸入品、立即加以節制、或用限制進口額類制或完全禁止進口均無不可、要在英國絲織廠得避免歇業則可矣云（十一日日聯電）</p>

<h3>歐市絲市暴跌本市絲廠紛紛停工</h3>
<p>每担僅値七百元虧本太鉅原因爲歐美存絲堆積滯銷</p>

<h3>交部計劃增設京滬電話新綫</h3>
<p>業務發展需要日漸繁劇限於四個月内完成通話</p>
<p>交通部長途電話局、自開辦以來、業務逐漸發展、原有之路線、雖經一再擴充、仍屬供不應求、爰於最近計劃增　新綫、沿京滬公路敷設、現已積極進行、並限於四個月内完成、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>業務發展</h3>
<p>京滬長途電話、開辦於民九間、自國軍底定南京、建立首都後、卽由交部接辦、從事整頓、設備逐漸完善京滬一帶、因政治商業之關係、長途電話之需要、日見繁劇、原有之通話線路、雖經一再擴充、仍屬供不應求、甚至有掛號者、須俟至數小時始得接話、而事實之需要、仍有日趨愈迫之勢、</p>
<h3>添闢新線</h3>
<p>交部長途電話局鑒於業務之發展、旣有待於擴充線中路之必要、惟原有之椑桿木、線路載重已滿、勢非另闢新線不可、乃决定循京滬公路、另闢新幹線、以應事實之需要、該線係自南京、經句容·宜興無錫·常熟·太倉·嘉定而迄上海、全程計長二百三十二英里、預算樹立桿木、須七·六七三根、線路敷設十號鋼線四對、</p>

<h3>救濟匪區亟不待緩</h3>
<p>匪區雖經各路軍隊進　、逐見收復、但人民流離失所、田園荒無、苟非亟加救濟、尙不足以言「拯斯民於水火、」救濟之策、雖由政府　密籌劃、按步實施、苟吾人能身屬内地、見此奄奄待弊之災黎、可知安處滬上之人民、眞所謂享福於天堂、同是一　人民、其生活情形、　絶一至於斯、則我人今後亦應如何刻苦自　、况義屬同胞、更應痛　相　、必以餘力、藉　拯救若人民生活得以安定、則赤匪更難思逞、</p>
<h3>勗勉同志勤奮爲國</h3>
<p>吳氏又述及在匪區工作者、自蔣委員長以至士卒、莫不歷盡艱苦、奮勉交加、其一致口號、所謂「救國救民、在此數年、亡國敗家、亦此數年、」在此時期、實國家民族之生死關頭、故吳氏即請某君轉告本市同志友好、更應如何勤奮爲國、羣策羣力、挽此危局、否則人慾横流、天怒人怨、國亡種滅、即在目前云云、</p>

<h3>田賽速記男子標槍彭永韾破全國</h3>
<p>（南京十二日電）男子標槍决賽、彭永韾破全國紀錄、標槍一項、爲滬平奪取田賽錦標之關健、故一時空氣緊張　滬平兩處選手、無不摩拳擦掌、冀得最後勝利、在練習抛擲時、北平彭永韾、上海郝春德、均一度超過五十米、孰料至止式賽擲時、成績反見遜色、結果彭永韾雖以四八米九二打破牟作雲保持之四七米二六之全國紀錄、但　綀習時退步極多、郝春德拚足老命、總趕不上練習時之成績、僅得四六米七二名列第三名影響上海田賽錦標不少、第二爲冀趙　明第四爲北平張齡佳觀各賽員、參加比賽、有一事</p>
<p>印於記者腦　、足有紀述之價値者、卽有數單位之運動員、對於標槍之技術幼雅、遠度僅在餘米、離前面四十米丈量之標準線極遠、以此每逢該運動員抛擲時、看台上時有譏笑聲音、但該運動員並不在意、且充滿研究與學習之精神、仍每次抛擲、實令人見之生敬、亦爲運動員應有之精神爲提倡運動會之眞目的、蓋運動非經過此階級、不能有若何進步、回想二十年前各大都都會之體育狀况、何嘗不似今日之内地、記者敢言數年之後、内地各處體育、亦不難趕及今日之都會情形、其最要者、在學習之情度與精神耳、希内地各省市選手、加鞭勉力、論各人抛擲姿勢、記者曾詢主持、標槍評判之王復旦、據云數十人中、鮮有合式者大半均不能利用腰力奔跑之速力、僅恃一臂之屈伸耳、故取績尙遠在人後、</p>
<h3>女鐵餅馬骥造新紀錄</h3>
<p>女子鐵餅、在全國運動會中、爲新項目、各地均不普及、故程度尙在幼稚、稍有成績者、不難占得優勝、上海之馬驥女士、卽華北著名擲重之馬子駿、近在滬濱極有進境、有女界中鐵牛之稱、對於鐵球鐵餅兩項、極有把握、故昨日女子鐵餅决賽、攫取錦標、一如劉長春之百米、毫無問題、</p>
<p>二百米今日决賽劉長春有破遠東希望</p>
<h3>男女徑賽預複賽速記</h3>
<p>二百米劉長春再創紀錄</p>
<p>（南京十二日電）男子二百米複賽　第一組第一爲冀韓景林成績二二秒八、成績殊爲可貴、詎於第二组第一之滬市宿笑如、更進一步而得二二秒七之成績、尤令人喜出望外者、爲第三組劉長春之二二秒、使二二秒四之全國紀錄、又行破産矣、劉在斯初賽時、起步亦遲、五十米後、始追出鍾連基、而至終點、則離鍾有十五米之遙、第三之程金冠更差鍾約二米、劉在抵終點時、似未用力衝劇、决賽時不難再進二十十秒間、而破遠東紀錄之二十一秒八、</p>
<p>造女鐵餅全國新紀錄滬馬驥（葉長烈攝）</p>
<h3>八百米董叔昭突破全國</h3>
<p>八百米預賽兩組冠軍均爲滬市所獲、第一組之競爭最烈、前四百米、魯賈連仁導先、鄭森緊隨之、五百米時、董叔昭後來居上、超出賈連仁約半米六七百米時、賈董並肩進行、至終點時、賈終被董壓倒、成績爲二分五秒二、與滬市大會之新紀錄相等、打破王銘練所保持之二分六秒八全國紀錄、第二組冠軍爲滬市李延祥、成績二分八秒四、李乃新進健將、前途可造就、</p>
<h3>中欄陶英傑希望最高</h3>
<p>四百米中欄賽、第一組保持全國紀錄之陶英傑、與平之王精熹相進、陶以越欄之敏捷姿勢而勝王、王之姿勢似不及陶、决賽時陶之希望較厚、第二組程金魁憑速度而得冠軍、成績爲六一秒二、不及陶之五九秒九第三組冠軍爲浙江之靳懹智成績六一秒一、决賽時靳當有入選希望、滬孫惠　落靳後約二十米、中欄複賽成績平均、無甚特異、蓋預賽與複賽相接不過三小時耳、</p>
<h3>女百米錢張二組最清彩</h3>
<p>女子百米複賽、三組有兩組成績打破全國已不讓孫桂雲專美於前矣、第一組廣東張潔琼十三秒五與第三組錢行素之十三秒五、同一紀錄、預料决賽時’張錢之爭、當不可免、第二組平藍滌清爲十三秒八、亦平全國紀錄、</p>
<h3>女跳欄錢行素穏得冠軍</h3>
<p>女八十米跳欄、三組預賽、四川吳素芸十五秒正、滬錢行素十四秒三三魯于秀蘭十五秒一、均創全國新紀錄、而尢以錢之成績最出色、複賽分三組、錢仍能維持其原有功夫、殊不可得、僅退後十分之一秒耳、其姿勢之美、博得全場掌聲如雷、該項决賽、當可穏取冠軍、魯于秀蘭被錢抛棄有五米之多、第二組亦滬曾惠瓊與第三組川吳素芸、同以十五秒正破全國、</p>
<h3>林主席昨參觀</h3>
<p>（南京十二日電）林主席十二日下午四時許、蒞全運會塲參觀、在田徑賽塲門前下車、卽由大會招待組幹事引導進西門令台、步人東西司台兩台樂隊奏樂歡迎、林目睹數千健兒競賽、甚　欣慰、人東司令台時、王世杰王正廷張伯苓及觀衆來賓、均起立致敬林含笑、禮答坐第二排正中、六時始回城、又孫科朱家驊石瑛唐有壬夫婦曾仲鳴周啟剛均到塲參觀、</p>

<p>晨九時、戰鄂陳福愉、首都人民、聲震其名、而來參觀者、不下數百人、鄂陳爲前滬上健將、技術亦甚可觀、但與許君相較、不啻小巫之見大巫、雖努力反抗、終究相形見拙、不支而敗、比數爲六比一、六比零、六比一、均爲巴許勝、</p>
<p>▲林續音力戰克敵</p>
<p>許陳之戰方終、巴林續音對鄂羅光圭之賽繼起、照秩序所定上午僅賽一單打、下午有雙打、及第二單打兩組、乃因巴城要求將第二單打提前舉行、得鄂之同意、故臨時更動、開賽之初、鄂羅光圭聲勢淘淘、大有氣呑山河之槪、以四比一領前、但林究非弱者、且因巴城僅有二代表出席、照大會規定、單打選手不得兼任雙打、巴城雙打、不得不棄權與鄂、是以此組勝負、有關大局、因之林君急起直追、連下三局、成各四平手後、羅又得發球局、以五比四佔先、但林之發球局一再造成各五平手、繼林又連取二局、以七與五之比終、第二盤始羅氣力不加、一蹶不振、林則氣𦦨萬丈、鋒芒大露、一氣呵成六局、以光盤結束、第三盤劇戰再開、　林失發球局、第二局羅球、競爭更烈、竟有七次平手、終被林取得是局、後再成各二、繼林連得三局、成五比二、最後羅雖竭力掙扎、取得二局、但大勢已去、終以四比六再敗、結果林以七比五、六比零、六比四之直落三勝、巴城遂以二比一淘汰鄂、而第三週賽、</p>
<p>▲介紹許林之球藝</p>
<p>許承基之發球、峻急非凡、不下於林賣華、而長抽及攔網、更爲出色、斬球亦佳、絶少自殺及野球、惟高壓尙少把握、奔跑迅速、姿勢優美、實爲不可多得之全材網球家、林續音之長抽、及斬球不下於許君、而高壓之佳、亦稱獨步、惜乎發球軟弱、身體肥胖、不善奔走、此點吃虧不少、鄂之羅光圭短小精悍、極善奔跑、每有似乎不及回擊、之球、均被其一一還出、且發球長抽、均甚可觀、惟高壓欠佳、姿勢步法、亦均可取、前途無量、羅君其勉之、</p>

<p>女體專家張匯談、京市短跑健將胡瑞聲、此次比賽失敗原因有二、（一）京市女子體育太不普、遍平時練習者、僅有極少數人、感到興趣參加比賽者、亦僅此少數人、胡瑞聲參加項目太多、賽前無充分休息、爲失敗原因之一、（二）發令方法、與起脚快慢、大有關係、胡以關某之發令法與普通不同、致五十米起點、慢至二步、而落選深爲可惜、滬粤女子運動普遍、人才輩出、成績大有進步、女錦標爲滬粤之爭、京市望塵莫及、此後應努力倡導、使中央所在地之女子體育、能與滬粤並駕齊驅、深望敎育行政當局及京市同仁、三致意焉、</p>

<h3>各塲巡禮　憲兵如臨大敵北方人好興趣眞材異士未見門票收入失望</h3>
<p>▲兩副面孔</p>
<p>（南京十二日電）田徑場門禁森嚴、管門處之憲兵、荷槍實彈、如臨大敝、下午田徑舉行、旣不得間人進步、卽上午無田徑賽時、亦不得入、但十二晨有女壘球一塲、在田徑場中舉行、記者爲採訪消息起見、擬入塲觀看、困於門禁無法可想後向場外兜至後面、卽東司令台入口處、不顧七二十一衝入場去、竟然　過、不覺喜出望外、但思門卒兩副面孔、又不禁使人奇怪、</p>
<p>▲觀衆怪聲</p>
<p>晨滬對魯男籃球次賽、觀衆甚爲擁擠、魯自聲敗河北博得勁敵美譽後、今番與上海之戰、故極受觀衆注目、該隊傅遞迅熟、惜乎投籃不十分準確、滬隊之得勝、固在意中、魯之球藝、亦頗得觀衆好感、惟動作猛勇、常有犯規、而一般北方觀衆、常怪聲呌好、引起全塲之注意、</p>
<p>▲刀光劍影</p>
<p>國術埸上、觀者最多、塲地劃一大圓圏、中心一小圏、兩旁又各一小圏、賽員入塲、卽入兩邊小圏、裁判員執綵旗一面、居中一場、兩賽員卽奔至中心圏、開始搏擊、胸口護以棒球、接手所用之護胸、以防擊傷、如將對手摔倒、或逼出大圏之外、卽爲勝利、其他評判及紀錄等、均坐大圏之旁、刀槍劍戟、各色武器、分列兩排、刀光顯耀、威嚇非凡令人慄然、此項器械、犀利鋒鋭如一旦使用、不免發生危險、兩日來之拳鬥、眞材異士、猶未得見、</p>
<p>▲觀衆寥寥</p>
<p>各塲比賽、自第二日起、均須購票入塲、但南京當地人士前往問津者、殊爲寥寥、故售票亭前生意乃大不景氣、僅上海趕來之少數熟心、購票入塲耳、大會豫算二萬元門票收入、將完全失敗、觀者雖多、大多爲選手及各項名譽幹事職員等以及學校圑體武裝同志耳、此會若在上海舉行、門票收入、必大有可觀、</p>

<h3>全運會男女健兒應注意體育醫學</h3>
<p>▲食慾與體重之减退是惡化的神經衰弱</p>
<p>一般神經系的變調、乃運動員體質變態一部分之微象、經過度訓練之後、則神經系之變調昂勝、因之而顯示一種特殊神經症狀、可以卜知其體質之變態亦係昂進、並能藉而判斷其爲遇勞運動之際、神經系與其他、諸官器爲伍、而作猛烈之活動、運動後則神經系的疲勞、可以表示出來一種極顯　的現象、名體育醫學家德人阿西杜敎授謂、「神經系於遇度疲勞時、其較筋肉之疲勞尤甚、</p>
<p>故運動之需要神經系活動者、其所惹起之疲勞特别劇烈、若常致神經疲勞、而不與以充分之休息機會、則甚易呈一種神經衰弱之症候、卽食慾减退、失眠、記憶力及判斷力　麻、性情僞倚、意志喪失、缺乏果敢斷行之能力、運動選手之行遇度猛練習者、甚易陷於此種狀態、此種神經性的疲勞非起於偶然、乃由於數週或數月間所造成欲使其恢復原狀、亦非經長期之休養不可、此又謂之爲由運動而所致之慢性疲勞、此係則體力消磨、食慾减退、因常陷於失眠故體重乃逐步低降、以是爲敎練員者、對於運動員體重驟减之原因、不可不加注意、此種影響、而於技巧複雜之運動競賽中尤甚、於對抗比賽之前、因其練習致精神作激烈之緊張、故最易致神經系之陷於遇勞、如不加以相當之休息、而使其症狀昂　、則甚易惹起其他疾病、</p>
<p>▲一勞作併發症屬於體質變態之惡化</p>
<p>德國雷比斯博士最近發明一種「勞作併發症」、</p>
<p>此種病理最足令吾輩體育界所須研究者此種致病原因、乃一體格健全之人、俄然行激烈的體育運動、或一慣於勞働之人、偶然受兵式的軍事訓練而發生、本症最重要之兆候、爲身體雖僅作輕微之運動、而心悸必昂進、呼吸亦覺咸促立刻全身感生疲勞、而甚至頭痛眩暈、一般醫生對於此種病源、多盲加診斷、恒謂一健壯之人而不耐運動者、必係有脚氣作崇、事實則大誤而特誤、此種症候、確係雷比斯博士所發見之一勞作併發症」、其源因乃係因心臟單獨活動、與調整之神經系（交感神經及副交感神經）不相聯絡、此種症候、確非疲病、乃副交感神經症候、（遲脈及低血壓）及神經疲勞（慢性疲勞）症候昂進之特異戀形、若再接再勵、而施以體育訓練、則「勞作併發症」可使體質之變態愈趨惡化、因之體力必逐步低减、要則「勞作併發症」、不過屬體質戀態殊之症例耳、</p>
<h3>當前之急務運動員應識體育醫學</h3>
<p>運動員内臟諸官器之機能、及其體質之狀况、若能呈適應之變態、而運動能力能隨訓練之程度</p>
<p>遲緩、心臟之膨大、及低血壓等、因之而造就優秀出衆之體力、實事此種徵兆、均非屬於病理的、對於康健均無任何障碍、運動員於行康健診查之際、其體質之變態、恒易被誤診爲内科之疾病、因危俱爲懹、乃不惜將運動斷然放棄、此種影響、頗能妨碍全般的體育普及、故對於運動員之體質變態、須有切實之認識、乃當前之急務、而於診斷此種體質變態之際、更須注意其中是否附帶過勞性質、且其變態程度如何、於將來是否能惹起起其病症、運動員欲診視其體質之現况、固須囑諸醫師、然而運動員體格之特殊變化程度、非兼有體育經騐之醫師則莫能識、以是最善之道、每一運動員、應各對體育醫學稍有認識、能善於測知其個人之體格狀態、以最完善安全之方法、支配其運動之度數、與休養之時間、庶可使身體不罹意外之疾病、</p>
<p>▲豫知過勞之方法可賴測騐體重肺活量</p>
<p>運動過度則體質必發變態、副交感神經症候及一般神經系　勞症狀、必隨疲勞之狀態而昂進、欲鑑别此等兆候、須視脈搏之是否緊張或減退、屬小脈（　脈）抑或爲自力性逆反脈、及脈搏次數如何、是否遲滯性、心音是否低微、有否急性心臟擴大症、如能診明以上諸點、則可斷定爲循環系的疲勞、若再發現腱骨膜及射昂進、顔面神經兆候、及神經衰弱諸症狀、則可證明爲「勞作並發症、」一般神經系過勞者、卽體質之變態必感惡化、因新陳代謝之關係、尿成之分亦異常尿中之　素量激增、故藉檢視尿之成分、卽可知過勞之程度、過勞之際、體重因之而减退、體力亦每况愈下、體力之低隆、可藉測騐肺活量而測知之、肺活量之減退、乃過勞之兆候、肺活量之變動、頗據敏鋒、故藉檢視體重及肺活量而爲豫知疲勞程度之方法、乃爲至要之事、因此種方法比較簡易、且不難實行、若能完全豫知體質變態趨於惡化、應將嚴重之運動訓練減輕、或中止之、而作　當之靜養、運動員之　背體育醫學、因之而罹病致死者、不知凡幾、</p>

<h3>對於「小學生文庫」的希望</h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>中國出版界興行「文庫」這名目，不過三年光景。鼎鼎大名的「萬有文庫」可以説是文庫的一世祖。</p>
<p>照「萬有文庫」廣告上的説法，買了一部「萬有文庫」就是一個小小的圖書館成立了，不但版　整齊，而且代編好了目錄，印好了書根，裝好了書櫉，今天交出錢去，明天圖書館就辦成，就差没有代代造圖書館的房屋。</p>
<p>圖書館本來愈多愈好，所以圖書館的代辦者應得給他祝福。但是這位代辦者的責任却也因此加重。因爲他除了代編書目，印書根，配書櫉而外，還代替選書。譬如一家包酒館，招呼週到，固然是好的，但所用酒肴總也得全是新鮮的才好。而以前出來的「萬有文庫，」我們就覺得有些書籍是陳年「底貨，」「回湯」</p>
<p>了一下，當作時新品拿出來賣的。</p>
<p>現在商務印書館又舉辦「小學生文庫」了。一下就是五百種，内容包括了「國書館學，社會科學，自然科學，應用技術，藝術，語文學，文學，史地各方面，無不賅備；參照本　兒童的需要，爲適當的支配一云云。在此兒童讀物貧乏的時候，「小學生文庫」的出　自是造福萬家；然而總希望不要再像以前的「萬有文庫」拉上許多「底貨」凑數，例如二十年前出板的「少处叢書」之顧、並不是説「少年叢書」没有一本要得，但大多數不合於現代思潮，是不態諱言的罷！此外，商務印書館十年前出板的兒童讀物還有許多關於自然科學及文學的，也不免疏漏錯誤的地方；如果也變成「回湯荳腐乾」夾在這次的「文庫」中，也就不成話。</p>
<p>所以看了「小學生文庫」的廣告以後，我就着急的想要知道「文庫」的五百本書究竟是些什麽名堂。</p>
<h3>寫信</h3>
<p>— 老舍</p>
<p>寫信是近文化病之一，類似痢疾，一會兒一陣，每日若干次。可是如得其道，或可稍减痛苦。茲條列有效辦法如下··</p>
<p>（一）給要人寫信宜掛號，或快郵，以引起注意；要人每日接信甚多也。</p>
<p>（二）託人辦事的信，莫等回信（參看第四條），應即速發第二封。第二封宜比第一封更客氣，好像對方不回信是理之當然。這樣，或使對方覺得不好意思不回信。</p>
<p>（三）託人辦事的信，信封信紙均宜講究，字勿潦草。頂好是隨寄些禮物。　友人求事函，雖利用訃文之空𨻶亦可。</p>
<p>（四）接信切勿於五日内回答，以免又惹起麻煩。尤其是託辦事的信，擱下不答也許就馬虎過去，焉知求事之人不於最短期間已從别方面有了辦法哉。如又得函催辦前事。仍宜不答，似與之絶交者。直至你託他時，再恢復邦交。</p>
<p>（五）與不識之人通信，宜呼老師。</p>
<p>（六）接不相識之人來信，不答；如呼老師，可報以短函。</p>
<p>（七）託人轉信，須託比收信人地位高的。</p>
<p>（八）回信不必貼足郵票；不貼尤妙。</p>
<p>（九）爲减少檢信官員的疑心，書信宜用文言，問候語越多越好。</p>
<p>（十）故意願受檢查（如駡人的祖宗函），信封上宜寫某某女士收或發。</p>
<p>（十）（一）掛號信勿落於太太之手，恐内有匯票也。</p>
<p>（十）（二）見别人的信，當即代拆閲；閲後，保存或扔棄，隨便。</p>
<p>（十）（三）索欠函或賬條且原封退回。</p>
<p>（十）（四）無論塡何項表格，「永久通信處」宜空着。</p>
<p>（十）（五）平安家信印好一千張，隨時塡發。本條極不適用於情書。</p>
<p>（十）（六）情書與絶命書同時寫好，以免臨時趕作。</p>
<h3>看了春蠶影片之後</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>影片「春蠶」，是中國新文學作品之最初的上銀幕。今天「新光」到了意想不到的多數觀衆。這底確是呆以記錄的。</p>
<p>「掙扎」，「小玩意」，「春蠶」，今天的廣告，眞是給了人以强烈的剌激。雖在三個電影院都在映演初上銀幕底國産影片，雖在天陰欲雨，但是恐怕各處都是人滿罷。</p>
<p>外國影片，是只有「賴婚」，「牛路」，「金山」等可以招引得這麽多的觀衆罷。</p>
<p>這種現象是深有意義的。中國電影文化之進步，中國新的文化之進步，從這一點，可以被反映出來了。</p>
<p>電影接近了文藝，使文藝作品上了銀幕，這是第一個可紀錄的。</p>
<p>電影日趨接近羣衆，成爲敎育羣衆之工具，使觀衆到電影院中不只是可得到娛樂，而且可得到敎育，這種新的傾向也是可記錄的。</p>
<p>這一種電影的進步，同時也是反映着中國社會的進步。水災，兵災，兵災，旱災，蝗災，豐災，促成了中國的農村破産，都市中小市民失業的失業，無出路的無出路。但是，同時，對於製造災害的帝國主義者，中國民衆更進一步地表露出懀恨來了。從國産電影的取材之點，和民衆熱烈地歡迎之點來説，中國民衆反帝的情緒是日益高漲了。</p>
<p>帝國主義的壓迫一類的字樣，上了銀幕，這正與帝國主義的「野獸片子，非洲黑人牛活影片，成了對照。</p>
<p>但是，電影雖在實踐着敎育大衆底任務。他雖描寫農村的没落，雖暴露階級社會中之矛盾，但是，帝國主義的　暴兇惡。例如「春蠶」，則終是没有指示出農民的出路是在於反對帝國主義。</p>
<p>銀幕没有過「鴉片戰爭」，也没有過「圑匪之亂」也没有過眞實地描寫水災的作品，也没有「九一八」「一二八」的眞實的影片。這是很大的缺憾。</p>
<p>譬如「春蠶」，他只寫了農村破産，絲繭豐收而農民挨餓之一方面；而另一面呢，對於帝國主義之侵略，外絲之侵略情形，「九一八，」「一二八」，等等的事變，以及國内的種種的災難，一點都未表現出來。令人看不出一個對照來。這種消極的寫法，的確是中國文學作品上和電影上的一個大缺點。</p>
<p>「怒吼罷，中國」!我們須要在文學作品上在電影片上，表現出來怒吼的民衆</p>
<p>在電影上看見帝國主羲的本來面目。日本詩人村山行義作了戲曲「鴉片戰爭」。我們則需要使「鴉片戰爭」一類的帝國主羲壓迫中國的近情實事映上銀幕。</p>
<h3>澉浦通信　（四）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兄··</p>
<p>在上　封信裡我叙述了半日的遊踪，這裡再　　的寫下去吧。所謂　仙嶺，就是南北　木山的夾道，這是交通不便的往　的到浙江省城的唯一的要的道路。因此，在嶺　最高處，是兩而倚山的造了一座石城，駐兵防守。可是現在，是不同了，有火車而　有公道，於是道工程浩大的石城，便成了歷史的遺蹟，駐兵没有，石城殘敗不堪了。以前的交通要道，現在是專作趕牛馬上省城之用了。但這兒的風景是頗可觀的。在一面的城門上，你可以看到南北湖，可以看到監場，看到海，看到海中有名的古蹟長帆。以及秦始皇住過的秦註山。在另一面的城門上，你更可以看到九十里外的海寗的海，大尖山多麽浩森幽遠的海啊。在這裡看，很有如就在目前呢？而尤其會令你感歎的，是兩面的石城，並不在你　山時就給你露面，假定每邊從嶺　到嶺嶺是五里路，那麽你　定要走過四里半，或者更多一點，轉了最後的灣，你繼能看到如不盡的樹不掩護着的城門，遠望如一個月亮，再跑上一些，你才能看到城的。這一絶境，在當時，頗有點令我們呌絶。</p>
<p>上山了，上的是南木還是北木，我簡直弄不清楚。但沿石城上山，那條路頗令人想到盡境。在叢林中一條有石級的山路躺在我們的面前，我們一步一步的上，高遠而又高遠。假使我們那時都帶有淺黄色袈裟，穿着芒鞋，用ａｍｒａ來它幾個鏡頭，到眞有趣得很。到了山頂，向對面的木山看去，纔知道那山頂上和這邊一樣的有一大村人家，可是除非你走向山頂你是不會看到，想到的。世外桃源，大槪就是這一類的地方吧。在那裏，我們頗休息了，些</p>
<p>很好的。同遊者之一回答我説，如果眞有肺病，當抬上道樣的高山時，他是一定會氣绝了的。這句話很有道理，説得我啞口無言。再沿山頂的路前進，右折，穿過叢林，横在面前的，想不到竟是一片茫茫的大海，山勢斜削下去，</p>
<p>在凹裡，嶔了那名字極秀麗的黄沙塢，山坡中間有幾顆高大的松樹。透過這些樹　欣賞海洋，尤覺得是意未無窮。中國海啊！中國海啊！在這裏，我們了解你的　大了，但是，你震蕩着人們心魄的怒潮，要到什麽時候來呢？</p>
<p>經過了建築在臨　的山頂上的白雲庵舊址，我想過去的那些和尙眞個是田園詩人「投胎」竟會尋到這樣壯偉秀麗的所在來休養（恕我不相信是修道），可是現在是衹有這遺址，祇有這一堆瓦　了，難道是風雅絶滅，繼起無人麽？又不禁爲和尙高士們　歎。過此下山，到了澉浦最有名的　窩頂雲岫寺，這兒背後的山上，就是　歷初一可以看到日月並升的地方，此事前人歌詠已多，恕小子不　。這寺前有很古的銀杏樹，寺中有具有階級觀的尼姑。何以説尼姑具有階級觀呢？從茶上可以看得出來，就是有錢的來給細茶喝，没錢的來給你粗棄。不知我佛如來，跑到森林中四十九日悟道時，亦曾參透此中微妙否？從此下山，經過九曲崇高的山徑，翻四顧嶺，走　家　回家。在萬黄山下看錶，長短針正指在四點半上；兩位朋友又各自駕了一隻輕舟，在湖中學習，不斷的翻着觔斗了。　　　　阿英　　　八月二十二晚</p>
<h3>閩西的婦女</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>一、有趣的離婚</p>
<p>這是我第一次去湖邦區，本來跑了卜里路已經有點疲倦了，很想休息一下，可是郭君很興奮地説··「我們到外面走走吧，今天是趕集的日子，各鄉來的人很多，街上熱閙得很。」</p>
<p>「好，去吧。」</p>
<p>我不她幸負他的意思，立刻放下茶杯，就隨着他還有和我同來的陳君一同走到街上。在平時，這的確是一條冷清清的街，舖子只有四十多家，而且都是破舊的，在裏面能夠買到的東西也只能限於士兵們和鄉下人的需要。可是今天大不同了，街上擠滿了戴斗笠穿草鞋或者赤着脚的男人女人，他們挑了各種各樣的農産品賣，每個人都是很忙地在做着交易；我們要費很大的力，才能從他們的陣營裏冲出來。</p>
<p>「喂，委員長，站住，站住，我有話和你談。」</p>
<p>突然從叢中走來一個跑得氣喘的年約三十餘歲的女。</p>
<p>「什麽事情？」郭君問。</p>
<p>我們　站住了。</p>
<p>「關於我和我丈夫離婚的事，已經由區委會批准了，但是我從前用了他十元錢，現在應該遠他。不過借他的是大洋，而我現在因了窮困只能遠他十塊小洋，委員長，你説可以嗎？」</p>
<p>哈哈啥，他們　大笑起來了，我不懂他們爲什麽這樣大笑，郭君連忙翻譯給我聽。</p>
<p>「那麽，你怎麽回答她呢？」我問郭君。</p>
<p>「我回答她，最好遠他大洋，萬一辦不到，小洋也可以的，不過要好好地和他説明。」</p>
<p>就這樣，那人認爲已經得到了圓滿答覆，很高興地走開了。</p>
<p>「這樣　罕的事我遠是第一次見到。無論在目前中國的那個階級裏的人們，如果離婚，總」</p>
<p>是男的給瞻養費或者離婚費給女人的··而這里的女人，不但不需要什麽瞻養費，連用了幾塊錢都要還清，眞不愧　個獨立的女性。」我很快活地對郭君説。</p>
<p>「最有趣的是借大洋還小洋的話，雖然相差很小，但他却認爲是一個嚴重的不得了的問題」</p>
<p>，所以特來請示··」陳也插進來微笑着説。</p>
<p>「的確，這里的女人是和别處特别不同的，她不但自已的生活由自已負擔，而日大半遠們」</p>
<p>要負擔家庭。離婚，都是由女方提出來的，没有能力或者好吃懶做的丈夫，時時都擔心　子提出離婚。」郭也很愉快地説着。</p>
<p>「那麽，每個男子都要起恐慌了。」我笑着説。</p>
<p>「當然　，他們有些還靠着妻子來養活自已的，更是戰兢地生怕失掉了她。」</p>
<p>「這倒不愧爲　個女兒國！」大家都笑了。</p>
<p>郭繼續地説着關於離婚方面的話，因爲我們已走到了煤山，所以　　就轉了方向。</p>

<p>世界麥市之觀察</p>
<p>最近據　治勃蘭　兒一九二二年至一九三三年及一九三一年至一九三二年之歐洲麥收估計，以及各地方之麥收估計，有如下列，（　爲單位每噸二二四○磅）</p>
<p>一九二丨一九三三年　　　一九三一丨一九　　年歐洲　　　四、○三、四二○　　　　三九、八九九、九九七</p>

<p>以上惟澳洲及阿根廷之産額不在内、因須　至一九三三年十二月始收割也。雖比　九三二年少去八百萬噸。然可以蘇俄及中國較豐收之數補充之也、（按上列各個小麥收穫估計數中無中國及蘇俄之數字在内）小麥收穫之數　如是，則後此來華傾銷，仍爲不可掩之事實。如果我之農産物、亦能鼓勵增植、似可無慮洋麥之傾銷。彼以此來，我以此往，然後方能　到眞實之抵抗。否則徒以押欵爲能事，課税爲得計，能否　　　外之不傾銷，　爲　　，至現在之粉價，是否爲一最低價，更屬疑問也（完）</p>

<h3>香爐下發現怪字條　一紅顔宫女談宫瑣事之二</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>昔充儲秀宫的女婉霞，便是今日北平的李桂貞女士。伊述廢宫瑣事，又有香爐下發現怪字條二則，略記如左··</p>
<p>建福宫失火，已是十餘年前的憧憬··起火的情形，宫中人簡直有些莫名其土地堂；爲着莫名其土地堂，以致大燒其袓宗堂，事後，紛紛傅説，都抱怨着莊師傅在祖宗堂攝影，得罪了列袓列宗，因此，降下這一塲轟轟烈烈的大火。</p>
<p>原來，建福宫是大内的袓宗堂和佛堂，其中，供着神佛的塑像，和祖宗的遺影。溥儀的師傅英人莊士郭偏要到外人闖不進的祖宗堂裏去瞻仰一番，非但，瞻仰遣像，而且，攝了這裏的祖宗影去。溥儀一應允，滿足了莊師傅的要求，宫中人却是慄慄畏懼，只怕激怒了祖宗。果不其然，數天後，管理本宫的内監，竟在佛堂的香爐底下發現一張「你攪我，我不攪你」的字帖。當時不敢奏明，防着擔受假造神書的處分；誰知没多幾天，建福宫無端起火，燒得一乾二凈。主管的太監，在那火𦦨正熾的時候，知道自已的罪名不小，便想去跳火坑隨那列祖列宗的遺影，同化灰燼。但，被旁的太監拖住了，追問他失火的情形；他便把莊師傅攝影以後，便發現了香爐底下的字帖一一説了。奏明溥儀以後，溥儀道了一句「此天意也，」竟没有治那主管太監的罪名。</p>
<p>建福宫失火一事，外面人很明瞭情形，分明是内監盜賣了宫中的祭器，恐被溥儀覺察，所以放一把火，案性無可查考，同成了灰燼。火熾時，假作跳火坑，又呌同伴拉住着，又僞造香爐底下的字帖，以爲祖宗發怒，全爲莊師傅攝影起見。這都是他們預定的步驟，把溥儀愚弄一下，溥儀做過閹儡，又來做日人的傀儡，這傀儡戲眞是他的拿好戲。</p>
<h3>悼陳佩忍先生</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>革命詩人陳佩忍先生，不幸去世了。他的革命事業，大約知道的很多，也不用多説。他在這幾年中間，不</p>
<p>些出來，見得冠蓋京華中，竟容不得憔悴斯人，怎的不氣死人也麽哥！</p>
<p>他老先生並不是不想做官，無奈他根本不配做官。喝飽了老酒，就得駡人。那些新貴的遺聞佚事，都在他不合時宜的肚皮裏，一説出來，就得聞者錯愕。</p>
<p>因此只把那些孤老院院長式的江蘇革命博物館長，江蘇通志局編纂等等高帽子，給他戴。後來索性緊縮掉，過他浩然歸故鄉。</p>
<p>但是他老先生的確有寗靜淡泊之志晚年得子，繞膝怡然，替太夫人築了一個墓，樹牌建亭，蒔花植木，瀧崗之阡，總算不落寞了。還在舊居添屋數椽，以爲莬裘之營。今夏到蘇行報恩寺聽經，竟想皈佛子，他寫信给我，竟稱「衲」了。六十稱觴，做了四首七律詩。豈知隔不到半月，就溘焉長逝。他的門弟子預備替他刊印二十五種的浩歌堂叢書，不過甫發其端，如今他死了，這件事不知道有没有阻力？因爲「人在人情在一啊。</p>
<p>我最後和他喝酒，是在六月二十日。他帶一束癸丑革命文件給我，我爲了牙痛，怕喝酒。他説，多喝了酒，也要牙痛，但是酒興依然不减。後來在吳苑。同喝過一回茶，精神狠好。七月裏到故鄉去訪他，他到報恩寺了，但是我還蘇州。竟没有到過報恩寺去訪他，這是一點遺憾。</p>
<p>不久我還把他考證一個郎字的話，在春秒披露咧。但我自從接到這一回的信以後，没有再見他的片紙隻字，所以我當保存這最後的一封信，紀念我們的忘年交。</p>
<p>他老先生的不治生産，大槪也是詩人的遺傅性，雖不見得身後蕭條，但是除掉幾屋子的書外，竟無長物可言。致力七命四十年，如此歸宿。咳！</p>
<h3>京華觀感錄</h3>
<p>— 紹隆</p>
<p>此次重遊京華，觀感所及，聊誌數則，以資參考··</p>
<p>京市自一二八以來，日益蕭條，銀行林立，多不放欵，錢莊市面，幾有難以維持之勢。金融流通，速率不靈，購買力疲弱，各大商店每日無多交易，市上新屋有招租多時，仍無人賃居者。太平路南段，晚間多無燈火，惟夫子廟一帶，書塲，食館林立，營業較爲發逹，外强中乾，可見一斑。據商界某君云··南京出産，向以緞業爲大宗，牛皮次之目前緞工失業，惟恃牛皮爲來源，牛皮一項，又有半數係過儎性質，長此以往，地主財源日枯，未知伊於胡底？　　首都學校，除國立市立學校外，私校林立，間多未善，以金大及鍾英安徽兩中學較有悠久歷史，成績尙佳。但金大自收回自辦後，精神大不如前，並非揄揚外人，所採英文敎本，與各校略同，不如昔日由小學起都用美國課本，故直升該國大學，亦毫無困難云。</p>
<p>首都市政，尚在過渡時期，建設方面，多在停頓中，尤以城南飲料最劣，有碍衛生，京市當局，竟不注意及之，殊屬不解。城内火車各站，充滿暮氣，有不堪入目之槪，首都觀瞻所係，實不應如此也。</p>
<p>政治方面除一部分中委不在京外，各院部會長多輪流　游各地請假銷假，頗爲自如，日常事務，多由常次政次負責辦理，稍關重要事件，多電呈長官辦理，最重要事件，仍須在政治重心地點會議時議决執行，因此種種手續，頗影響於政治速率的效能。此爲政界某君所云；未知果如其説否？（不受酬）</p>
<h3>大家來樂一下再説</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>嘿今天不是咱們中華民國的「國慶紀念日」嗎？什麽「失地尙未恢復，河山變了顔色」，這都是「國恥」，不是「國慶」，管他媽的。一年一度的「國慶」，不比一年幾度的「國恥」，過了一個又一個。今天難得欣逢「國慶」的一天，怎麽可拿「國恥」的話兒來掃興？難得的啊，咱們中華民國還没有整個兒亡哩！現在只亡了東北的一隻角，有什麽稀罕？咱們不趁這時來樂一下，更待何時？</p>
<p>你如果身邊「麥克麥克」，那麽，在今天這個名正言順的「國慶日」，電影院，跳舞塲，都不可不去盡興的樂一下。否則，幾個銅子一兩的「白乾兒」，買它個半斤八兩，喝它個酩酊大醉，也是一樂呀。</p>
<p>你該明白，今日何日？今日是咱們中華民國的「國慶紀念日」，不是喪失了東三省的一九一八一紀念日哪。雖則失地還没有恢復，然而「國慶」到底是「國慶」。朋友！看透些，難得的，趁今天的「國慶日」，咱們中華民國還没有整個兒亡了的時候，上電影院，到跳舞聽，或是喝「白乾兒」，悉聽尊便，大家來樂一下再説！如果你對於失地未復，作無病的呻吟，嗼着「如此國麆，何慶之有」的話，那眞是一個大大的傻瓜。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>同時心裏想着無論如何，今天應當抽身回家去一趟，出發的日子，大槪是迫在目前了，早點加去，也好把家務安頓安頓。尤其是楊家母女兩個，眞有些愧對，人家早就表示着懐疑的態度，軍人怕是不能常在家的。現在剛一訂婚，果然就出發了，我得好好的去，安慰人家一陣。他如　想着，自已把公事桌裏的稿件賬目。搬了出來，看過兩頁，打算看完了就走，可是手下的何排長就來了。他行過了禮，正着臉色，用極温馴的語調道··排長想在連長面前求情，多借幾塊錢回家安頓一下。趙自强道；借錢這一層，我和各位一樣感着痛苦，多了實在不行，只能借三塊錢。你們眞要用的話，没有法子，我寗可少用兩塊，拿五塊錢去罷。你説請假回家的這一句話，照着人情説，我有什麽不能答應的。可是你想想，現在統共只有二十一二小時的工夫，你再要回家一趟，事情還來得及辦嗎？何排長道··這件事，總求連長特别的通融一下，三個鐘頭以内，我凖保來回。我家　有兩三個孩子，還有一個六十八歲的老娘，臨走我都不去瞧瞧，心裏實在過不去。他説到這裏，嗓子都有些僵硬了，只差不曾哭出來。到了這個地步，趙自强怎好不准人家的假。便道··好罷，你就回去一趟罷，只是你要早去早回，别讓我一個人，累着喘不過氣來。何排長行了個禮，轉身走了。趙自强對了桌上許多文件，不由得　了呆。心想何排長走了，這一排人的事情，我就得格外的擔心，這要抽身回去的機會，那就格外少了。自已嘆了一口氣，索興把文件都看了。於是捺住下了這口氣，又埋頭工作起來。看完了文件，又跑到各排去監督士兵收拾東西，再跑到庫裏去，檢點槍械子彈，圑部裏的錢，没有送來，不敢直接去討，還得找着營長去催促。</p>
<p>（二一一）</p>
<p>逰踪所至</p>
<h3>花塢歸來</h3>
<p>— 沈衡莊</p>
<p>久仰「花塢」之名，可是人們一到了杭州，因爲時間或是其它的關係，每　把這僻居西溪的勝景忘懷，我們一行人也不能例外，上了若干的杭州，這一次　算身歴其境。</p>
<p>機綠是這樣的，我們一到逹了杭州，軍師周世勳就决定了游程，從法院路世勳令岳的新屋出發步行到留下，這是很遙遠的一條途徑，我們爲着增加各個人的興趣起見，祇得照着他原定的計畫開步走一，打頭的是世勳的令岳六十歲的長者王仲衡先生，押隊的是軍師爺周世勳。</p>
<p>行行重行行，我們確疲乏極了，在花塢路口的一座開化凉亭裏歇脚，預備恢復了兩腿的原動力之後再繼續進行，巧極了，軍師爺斗然的在凉亭壁間發現了一篇好文章，「花塢爲西溪一帶風景最勝之地，塢中多蘭若，林泉幽靜，花鳥怡人，紧夕鐘魚遠　相接，兼溪光浸月，松　　風，置身其間，幾有山陰道上應接不㗇之勢，更無塵累擾人，卜隠斯山，烟霞終老世未　無其人也，」書這聯的其名呌　見龍道人，」當然，我們一行人在恭讀這一篇含有指南性質的文章之後，世勳第一個主張變更原定的前進的計畫，改道向花塢挺進，果然是佳境，　里之遙的花塢，整個的被包圑在山谷之間，這時又正是毛毛雨加緊工作，全塢的修竹都洗刷得像翠般的綠，對照着山谷間的紅花，再加上溪水的聲音，眞好像聽無弦之琴，豁逹舒散，令人神往，這時我們有些口渴了，據凉亭裏的人告訴我們塢裏每一個蘭若都可以叩門借茶，可是我們雖然見到有許多的茅屋轟立林間，因爲門雖設而常關的綠故，祇是膽小不敢一試，結果，公推世勳做了個執行委員，向一青蓮庵」去探險，經過他一陣推一敲之後，　有一位年近三十的女修道上把山門打開，含着一種深有「法味」的笑容，迎接我們一行善男子入座。</p>
<p>「青蓮庵」，要是效　藝家的素描來記述，祇是一個孤字可以代表一切，陪伴着這一位修道士終老的祇有那清　孤燈，其它，僅僅乎幾千株修竹而已。</p>
<p>吃過了「蘇州瓜子」，揩過了「香水」面，我們開始談話了，修道士遞過一張𨽻書的卡片給世勳，原來　的法名呌「妙光」，的確，這是名符其實的，世勳並且盛稱伊的面貌很有些像南海大士。</p>
<p>談話的經過，從青蓮庵談到了上海，又從上海而谈到當年的露蘭春閣瑞生蓮英，這是很使我們驚奇的，修道十年的伊，依然未忘懷這俗世的情潮，如數家珍般的反映出來，倒也别有奇趣。</p>
<p>隔了兩小時，我們畢竟是善男子，看見天色已晚，便見機告辭，免得這位修道士担着恐佈戒心了，出庵門，王先生謝了伊兩塊錢，再三的推却之下，伊才收了，伊一直送我們到溪邊，臨别並目對世勳説，「下次可以寫信通知伊，伊可以親治素齊以待」。世勳稱謝而别，一行人於是又振作精神週遊「留下」，六時許乘公共汽車返湖濱。</p>
<p>回家以後，我們向世勳索閲卡片，他似乎很不願意的從背心口袋裡一個幾重夾袋的皮夾子裡掏出來，給我們作了一　那的傅觀，又重行返倒它那嚴密的所在。</p>

        <h1>1933.10.13</h1>
<h3>Fang Ji's Remnants Flee Eastward, Destroying Telephone Lines Between Shunyi and Gaoliying; Wan Jun and Forces of All Sizes Also Recaptured Zhuangyi Area; Xinzhuang and Areas Around Zhuangyi Also Recaptured</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since Fang Ji's remnant forces occupied Dashiao Tangshan, they found it difficult to flee south and had no way to develop. Considering the people's hardships, the authorities originally intended to incorporate them, but because Fang and his group demanded too many harsh conditions and were difficult to subdue. Recently, it was decided that if Fang Ji's remnant forces occupied northern Beiping for a long time and still attempted to flee south, disturbing the local area, the elite troops of Guan Linzheng and Huang Jie would be sent to encircle and suppress them, aiming to pacify the area with one swift blow and bring peace to the people's lives. Upon hearing the news, Fang and his group immediately fled eastward. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Mafang stated that Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang held a military conference yesterday afternoon at the command post in Furèn Xinzhuang, gathering military officers for a long discussion, but without results. The generals concentrated the troops from the front lines and began to withdraw automatically, occupying Dashiao Tangshan, Hulu River, Dashiao Furèn Xinzhuang, and other places. Ji's troops retreated north at night, passing through Qincheng, Xingshou Taolinyu, and Rushan, seemingly retreating towards the Sandaoguan area. Fang's army led his troops and retreated towards the northeast direction, Banqiao Village and Niulanshan area, seemingly collapsing eastward. This afternoon, the vanguard of Wan Jun entered Xiaotangshan to maintain local security. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, a telegram from Gaoliying stated that Fang Ji's remnant forces passed through Qiaocun and Niulanshan, fleeing to the vicinity of Shunyi County, Dongdulin Village, Xidulin Village, and the area around Longmen Village. The telephone lines between Shunyi and Gaoliying were destroyed by them, and they are currently confronting the garrison stationed in Manziying. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, after Fang Ji's remnant forces fled towards Niulanshan, they originally intended to cross the river northeast of Xiangyang Village in Shunyi and flee eastward, but were blocked by Japanese troops east of the river. They then turned south to flee, and now four or five hundred people have arrived at Dulin Village and Longmen Village west of Shunyi. They are currently being intercepted by our troops. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Tangshan and Other Places</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Mafang stated that the National Army recaptured Caoxinzhuang, Dashiao Furènzhuang, Dashiao Tangshan, Dashiao Dongliu, and the Shangxia Langou area this morning, and are currently searching forward. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhongfu Secretly Monitored</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, a telegram from Shahe stated that recently, after Fang Ji's army was blocked and attacked by our troops without success, internal opinions were extremely divided. Because Fang's army commander, Wang Zhongfu, strongly advocated surrender, it caused dissatisfaction among Ji and others, and they secretly monitored Wang Zhongfu. A few days ago, it was rumored that Fang would send Wang to Beiping to negotiate surrender, but Wang did not come, and Guo Yunlong was sent instead, presumably for this reason. Last night at 10 p.m., Fang saw that our army's defenses were tight and there were no opportunities to take advantage of, so he convened a military conference at Furènzhuang. At that time, some advocated reaching an agreement with a certain party, while others advocated returning to Zhangbei. Opinions diverged, and morale was scattered. As a result, they each acted on their own, and began to withdraw at about 3 a.m. this morning. Most of Fang Ji's troops, about two thousand people, were led by Ji, and fled east through Banqiao Village and Niulanshan. Whether Fang is currently in the army has not yet been determined. Wang Ying and other recruited bandit troops, about a thousand people, fled north through Daliushu Xiangtun Xingshou area, towards Taoyu.</p>
<p>Currently, after our army searched the Hulu River and Dashiao Furènzhuang area, there are no traces of enemy troops. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang Ji's Troops Move Towards Shunyi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) From the 11th, Fang Ji's two armies concentrated near Gaoliying Xiaotangshan Changping began to move towards Shunyi, which is close to the Japanese garrison. The situation has become more serious. The unit is moving into the demilitarized zone, which is not tolerated by the Kwantung Army. The Japanese army has completed all preparations on land and in the air and decided to begin appropriate and effective action to stop the destruction. (12th Telecommunications Telegram)</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult for Fang Ji's Remnant Troops to Maintain Themselves</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Refugees coming to Beiping from Baxianzhuang said that a large number of Fang Ji's remnant troops are gathering in Qincheng and Xingshou, with Wang Zhongfu and Xuan Xiafu's troops as the main force. However, the clothing and equipment of this unit are quite mixed, and discipline is chaotic. Wherever they go, they requisition grain and fodder, and loot everything. The people have abandoned their homes and fled. Fang himself went to Xiaoyangshan a few days ago, Xuan Xiafu's troops are in Erdaoguan, and Fang Ji's headquarters is in Pingyifen. It is predicted that within a month, when the weather turns cold temporarily, the army will lack both clothing and food, and will inevitably disintegrate on its own. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shunyi County Has Strengthened Its Defenses</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Shunyi County Magistrate Su Shijun received a report of Fang's troops fleeing east, he ordered the Public Security Bureau to close the city gates tightly and strengthen defenses. He also sent someone to Beiping to report to the authorities. This time, Fang's army attempted to flee east again. All units of a certain army stationed in Shunyi are on alert and defenses are strong. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Prevent Fang's Troops from Fleeing Eastward</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi stated that a unit of cavalry fleeing back from Niulanshan was harassing the area near Sanjiadian. Japanese Army Captain Itagaki Masayuki of the 5th Regiment led more than a hundred Japanese troops to Niulanshan this afternoon to prevent Fang's army from fleeing east. Fang's army is gradually dispersing and fleeing in different directions, and its strength has been disintegrated. (12th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) A telegram from Baxianzhuang stated that two Japanese reconnaissance planes flew to the area around Niulanshan Quanhe Banqiao Village at 2 p.m. today to scout the movements of Fang's army. They also dropped leaflets in Niulanshan to stop Fang's troops from fleeing to Luandong. The garrison forces in Shunyi are several times stronger than Fang's troops, and defenses are extremely strong. Fang's troops are causing disturbances near Shunyi, and a head-on blow will be dealt. The front line has not yet made formal contact, and traffic between Beiping and Shunyi is normal, and the local area is also peaceful. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xu Wenchuan Goes to Huairou to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Wenchuan, the magistrate of Huairou County, went to Huairou yesterday and has arrived at the county government today to resume his duties. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Yongning; Flying Near the Headquarters of the 10th Cavalry Division, Dropping Two Hundred-Pound Bombs, Killing Four Civilians and Three Donkeys</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Yongning stated that at 10 a.m. on the 11th, a No. 113 Japanese bomber suddenly flew in, reconnoitered for a moment, and descended near the roof of the headquarters of the 10th Cavalry Division, starting to drop bombs and shoot. The sound shook the roofs. After flying for about an hour, it went east. After investigation, in the street where the military law office of the division was located, four civilians, including Ma Yongwu and Wu Xiaomei, and three donkeys were unloading. They were unable to escape and were all killed by the bombing. Dozens of civilian houses were also destroyed. A total of two bombs were dropped in the area, each weighing about a hundred pounds. Two bombs were dropped in the courtyard of Wu Qianmin's residence, where the motorcade was stationed, destroying eleven large and small cars and six rooms. Four bombs were dropped on the field artillery company of the division, injuring two artillerymen, Wang Yongwu and Tong Jintang, and killing a young child. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Will Come to Beiping to Discuss the Military Expenses of Chahar Province</h3>
<p>Bandit Forces Rampant in Kangbao Shangdu (Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed a certain important person, saying that the military expenses of Chahar Province were previously set at 150,000 by the Military Subcommittee. According to the allocation for the existing army, it is far from enough. He intends to come to Beiping in person to meet with the military authorities for discussion. The Inner Mongolia issue is complex. The Central Committee ordered Zhe to handle it nearby through the Beiping Military and Political Commission. Song intends to report the actual situation of Inner Mongolia to the military and political authorities.

<h3>Chiang Kai-Shek Cables Provincial Chairmen to Solicit Opinions on Improving Provincial Governments; Switch from Committee System to Governor System, Starting with the Joint Office of Various Departments</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang previously formulated four guidelines for reforming county administration, but if provincial administration is not rectified, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of reforming county administration. The current system of provincial government committees has repeatedly shown drawbacks. It is planned to change to a governor system, first implementing the joint office of various departments of the provincial government. Recently, he specifically telegraphed the chairmen of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces to sign and submit their opinions for reference. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>(Omissions) Since the current system of provincial government committees has been implemented, its drawbacks have been repeatedly seen. Therefore, Zhongzheng had already listed its losses at the Sixth Internal Affairs Conference, and the Third Plenary Session also had proposals advocating the use of a governor system. It is truly urgent to renovate and improve. Recently, Chairman Zhang of Hubei reported that he was ordered to cut redundant staff in provincial departments and increase funding for county administration. His opinions were roughly as follows: County administration is a part of provincial administration. If provincial administration in various provinces is not rectified, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of reforming county administration. However, it is not possible to complete a fundamental reform of the current provincial system overnight. For the sake of convenience and implementation, various departments of the provincial government can first conduct joint office work under the current system. All documents are issued in the name of the provincial government. The heads of each department countersign on matters under their jurisdiction. In this way, all layers of transfer of documents between the departments in charge above and the provincial government, and between the departments and the counties, can be eliminated. According to this, personnel and expenses can be reduced by half. Taking Hubei as an example, the various expenses of provincial departments can be reduced by more than 500,000 yuan per year, which is equivalent to half of the county administration expenses of the entire province. If this system is implemented, the provincial government above will have the effect of unified will, and the counties below will not suffer from the complexity of government orders. Integrity will be increased, and emotions will be easily communicated. Moreover, it is not only about saving expenses, etc. It should be replied that there are now obstacles, contradictions, and redundancies in the province and the various departments in handling documents and issuing government orders, which have become a common problem. It is indeed necessary to thoroughly reform. Joint office work can undoubtedly provide considerable correction, and there is no doubt about it. However, Su and Yu provinces are currently testing this system, and the results have not yet been significant. There are also difficulties in fact that should be considered in advance, such as whether there is a branch office in the provincial capital that can accommodate the provincial government and various departments in one place, which is a prerequisite. If there is none, it can only gather the heads of the various departments to go to the provincial government every day to take orders, or all documents are collected and distributed by the provincial government. From the former, the provincial government and the various departments are still handled in different places, and their looseness, lack of agreement, and confusion are similar to the relationship between the Military Commission and the various departments of the military and training. It is not worth mentioning. From the latter, after the documents of the various departments are collected and distributed by the provincial government, they must be approved by the chairman and countersigned by the heads of the departments. One person's energy and time are limited, and it is doubtful whether they can respond adequately.</p>
<p>If you seriously investigate, there will be many backlog and delays.</p>
<p>The suspicion of doing things hastily, following the - Nuo, then the role of administrative supervision is completely lost. If the orders and sanctions of all the departments are inappropriate, the chairman cannot stop or revoke them again, and there is no way to help them. Moreover, a provincial government is more complicated than a central department. According to the usual practice, the departments in the department, such as the subordinate agencies, if there are more, in order to facilitate the command of affairs, are allowed to issue department orders without having to ask the ministry for instructions before acting. Then the department orders of the provinces may not be completely abolished. The situations of the civilian, financial, construction, and education departments among the four departments are also different. All of these should be properly planned and carefully revised before they can be implemented and avoid breeding malpractices. Please reconsider and answer separately to serve as a basis for approval. Matters concerning reform should be discussed extensively and discussed at length. You are all heads of provincial administration, or have tried joint office methods, and your understanding of the advantages and disadvantages is bound to be thorough. How should the above-mentioned difficulties be remedied? Or are there other better methods to sweep away the current isolation, contradiction, redundancy, stagnation, redundancy, and other disadvantages? I hope you will openly study, conduct extensive investigations, and sign and respond separately to serve as a reference. Zhongzheng. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Chinese Products Weekly</p>
<h3>The 22nd Anniversary Special Issue of the China Chemical Industry Society - Preface</h3>
<p>— Yang Qu</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai said, "The China Chemical Industry Society is the first to achieve fame both domestically and internationally, attracting mutual respect, and effectively recovering local outflow of profits, with an extremely simple organization, small-scale trial operation, and extremely arduous struggle." Mr. Fang Jiaobo said, "When the China Chemical Industry Society was first established, foreign goods had deeply rooted themselves in our country, and not only foreigners but even many Chinese people looked down upon it."</p>
<p>Indeed, when Mr. Fang Jun Yixian founded the China Chemical Industry Society twenty-two years ago, not only was there very little support, but there were also many who hindered and obstructed it. Mr. Fang and the gentlemen of the society went straight ahead with confidence, ignoring the obstacles, with a spirit of perseverance, inspiring their unwavering determination, working painstakingly, and managing diligently, finally achieving today's success. Its beginning was simple, and its completion will be grand. The reason for its success is by no means accidental or easily achieved. It is because the president has accumulated his experience, used his brainpower, and nurtured his spirit, following the teachings of Zeng Xiangxiang, "Look at the big picture, start with the small things, don't ask about the harvest, just ask about the cultivation." Those who aim high and far, call for empty slogans, and chase after extravagance cannot be compared on the same level. Mr. Zhang Gongquan once said, "Mr. Fang is using his mind to maintain his business every minute and every second." It is appropriate that his career is stable and the progress is rapid. The Three Stars toothpaste and mosquito coils produced by the company have almost replaced the Japanese "King Kong Diamond" tooth powder, "Pig Brand" mosquito coils, Ajinomoto, etc., in dominating East Asia. How can this be accidental?</p>
<p>Now, on the occasion of the twenty-second anniversary, Mr. Fang looks back on the past and hopes for the future, issuing a special publication. I hope that the Chemical Industry Society will pay more attention to the improvement of manufacturing, the reduction of costs, and the production and sales of more products in the future. If all imported products on the market can be replaced, then today's anniversary will have even greater contributions every year.</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Great Price Reduction</h3>
<p>— Xing Gong</p>
<p>Because of the economic depression in society and the near bankruptcy of the rural economy, all kinds of businesses have formed a bleak atmosphere. Thus, the term "Great Price Reduction" can be seen almost everywhere. In the most prosperous areas of cities, some stores hang the sign of "Great Price Reduction" all year round, but their business is still very dismal! From this phenomenon, we can see that the stimulus that "Great Price Reduction" gives to buyers has lost its exciting effect.</p>
<p>According to commercial principles, the meaning of "Great Price Reduction" is not only to use an opportunity to promote the sale of its usual surplus products to alleviate the company's or business's economic turnover; at the same time, it also contains a major purpose, that is, to make its own products, with the most effective method, sell to various cities and towns, and have a relationship with every family or individual, so that they have a good impression of their products.</p>
<p>Here, we should understand that "Great Price Reduction", although it is also a kind of advertising, is a "broad sense of advertising," rather than "narrow advertising!" If a great price reduction violates this main principle, then not only does it lose its function, but also its value disappears.</p>
<p>The China Chemical Industry Society is a business company that adheres to iron-like principles. It only holds an annual "Great Price Reduction" and never does so at other times. Therefore, its "Great Price Reduction" is a meaningful and valuable great price reduction, rather than one that takes "Great Price Reduction" as its "narrow advertising" function. Anyone who has purchased goods during the company's great price reduction period in the past already has a deep understanding of this. We welcome this kind of great price reduction, and society also needs this kind of great price reduction. Because, in this era of promoting domestic goods and world economic competition, this meaningful development in the domestic goods industry is worthy of our enthusiastic sympathy!</p>
<h3>Ever-Changing Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Pin Lan</p>
<p>Several new products of the China Chemical Industry Society</p>
<p>As the times progress, human beings feel a more urgent need for material enjoyment. In addition to the four basic elements of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—the issue of "use" is, of course, also indispensable. Even cosmetics, which were once luxuries, have become daily necessities. The general young men and women have a considerable understanding of the choice of cosmetics, they know that excellent cosmetics are not only boons to help beauty, but also daily necessities that are essential for hygiene.</p>
<p>Since the development of the new chemical industry, those old-fashioned rouge and face powder in our country have become outdated and belong to the category of self-elimination. New cosmetics from the East and West, using the protective talisman of tariff agreements, have been pouring into our country's interior, increasing a huge economic loophole in our country. Fortunately, people with lofty ideals in our country have seen this and have also risen to catch up, setting up factories to manufacture themselves to resist this trend. The China Chemical Industry Society is one of the foremost pioneers in domestic cosmetics manufacturers.</p>
<p>The China Chemical Industry Society was founded in the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. For more than twenty years, it has been committed to manufacturing. It has produced no less than two hundred kinds of cosmetic products. The most famous are the Three Stars brand toothpaste and soft snow creams, which occupy a leading position in domestic cosmetics. The annual production and sales volume of Three Stars toothpaste alone is more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In recent years, the cosmetics industry has shown an ever-changing trend in the progress of the times. In order to meet the needs of society, the company has also created many noble new products. Now I will pick out a few to talk about...</p>
<p>(1) Fangze Cream: Fangze Cream is a skin care cream. Its raw materials are extracted from the fat of plants and prepared by chemical methods. It is very different from ordinary powdery snow. Its function is to help nourish the skin, because the ingredients contained in its raw materials are extremely compatible with the body's natural fat, so once applied, the fat is absorbed by the skin and merges into one, leaving no trace. In the cold winter, applying this cream to the face, hands, and feet before going to bed can eliminate skin problems such as dryness, roughness, and wrinkles, and keep it smooth and delicate.</p>
<p>(2) Era Cream: Regarding the manufacture of snow cream, due to the progress of the times, it is changing with each passing day. Many men and women who love beauty not only want to choose its fine and uniform texture, but also are very precise about the choice of fragrance. For example, Japanese fragrant rose scent, jasmine scent, etc., are all based on the individual's psychological preferences to determine the selection standard. In order to cater to the psychology of buyers, cosmetics manufacturers are careful and thoughtful in the manufacture of a new product, in order to achieve perfection. The Era Cream newly released by the China Chemical Industry Society has undergone more than 230 experiments during the manufacturing period and has been given to more than 1,500 people for trial use. The results were then used to collect opinions and make the final determination standard. Therefore, the production of Era Cream, from the beginning of planning to the date of production, has gone through a course of one year and five months. Such careful consideration is beyond the reach of other cosmetics factories. Therefore, the value of this product is indeed standing at the forefront of the times and is the most suitable beauty product in the current trend!</p>
<p>There are many other new products. Regarding perfumes, there are Tianxiang Hair Tonic and Quina Hair Tonic. Regarding powders, there are Swan Face Powder and Tianxiang Talcum Powder. Regarding soaps, there are Peony Soap and Hygienic Disinfectant Medicated Soap. All of these are essential products for makeup and hygiene. Due to space limitations, I will not list them all.</p>
<h3>Food Supplementation</h3>
<p>— Jing Xing</p>
<p>There is a saying in our country's proverb that "food supplementation is better than drug supplementation", which means that the layer of tonic after human illness can replace the medicament with food rich in nutrients. However, thick and greasy food is not conducive to digestion. When appetite is abnormally excessive after illness, repeated illnesses are often caused by gluttony, which loses the meaning of health preservation. The occurrence of human diseases is generally due to a lack of nutrition and a decline in the metabolism of the blood, which is not enough to resist the attacks of diseases. After an illness, the skin becomes thin, the blood becomes dry, and the digestive ability becomes weak, which is a common phenomenon. At this time, we should think about how to guide it.</p>
<p>In recent times, the pharmaceutical industry has used amino acids as the main element for post-illness tonic and has made many medicines. Amino acids are the final product of a kind of protein, which has undergone artificial digestion. It does not need to be digested again by the digestive organs in the human body. After taking it, it is directly nourished through the stomach wall. However, it is still troublesome to separate taking medicine and eating.</p>
<p>Therefore, recently, domestic seasoning manufacturers, such as the China Chemical Industry Society, extract plant protein from wheat bran raw materials using chemical methods in their Meiwai Guanyin Powder, Meiwaisu, and Weisheng seasonings, retain the original strong umami flavor, and also use artificial digestion to make seasonings containing more than 80% of the umami acid, which can provide fuel for combustion in the body, adapt to the needs of tissue growth in the body, generate muscle and nourish blood, and increase appetite. Because the direct nourishment is effective, it can integrate taking medicine and eating into one thing, and combine medicine and food into one container. Even if it is a vegetarian dish and clear soup, adding a little bit of it will not only be delicious and plump, but also nourishing. The price is also very low. At a time when the social economy is declining, the purchasing power of the general public is insufficient, and all kinds of medicines are surprisingly expensive, it can be said to be the most suitable tonic.</p>
<p>Not only do people need economic tonics such as Meiwai Guanyin Powder, Meiwaisu, and Weisheng after illness, but the happiness of the family also lies in the health and strength of each member of the entire family. This tonic can improve nutrition and increase resistance to diseases, and it is also an essential daily necessity.</p>
<h3>Oral Hygiene and the Choice of Tooth Brushing Agents</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Although teeth are a small part of the body, they hold the key to human happiness throughout life, and most people do not pay attention to them. According to Dr. Glassco, a Russian dentist who served in the British army, "90% of British soldiers have decayed teeth." In a small city in the United States, it was found that as many as 95% of school-age students suffered from tooth diseases. What an alarming statistic! Even the British and Americans, who love hygiene so much, have so many sufferers of dental diseases! As for our China, because there has been a lack of investigation in the past, there are very few accurate statistics; but according to the recent results of the health education inspection implemented by the Nanjing Health Education Committee in Beijing, among more than 24,000 school-age students, more than 8,000 were found to have diseases, with an average of three diseased teeth per person, for a total of more than 24,000 diseased teeth. This statistic may not be able to represent the entire nation's dental disease statistics, but the fact that dental diseases are a common disease among humans is undeniable!</p>
<p>Usually, people view teeth only as something that helps with appearance, and if teeth are found to be decaying, they think it is a local problem and has nothing to do with overall health. Little do they know that the dental bone is connected to the nervous system, and dental diseases can directly affect intelligence. Moreover, the nutrition of the human body is entirely dependent on the chewing of the teeth, which are then sent to the various parts of the stomach and intestines. If the teeth are found to be decaying, the effectiveness of the chewing work is reduced, which hinders the digestion of the stomach and intestines, resulting in stomach diseases. It is clear that the teeth are actually in charge of the health of the whole body. Glassco put it best when he said, "Teeth are to people as millstones are to mills. If the millstones cannot grind the grains, then the baskets will only become waste!" Indeed, if food is not chewed by healthy teeth, the stomach and intestines will not have the ability to transport it.</p>
<p>Some people also think that the protection of teeth only needs to pay attention to middle age, and that is all that is needed. As for the baby teeth of newborns and minors, they can be left to their own devices; this is also an extreme mistake! Because the teeth of infants and minors can make the baby teeth neat and healthy, and the baby teeth are the foundation of permanent teeth. There is absolutely no one who does not have complete baby teeth and can produce healthy and beautiful permanent teeth. We often see many underage children with mouths full of yellow teeth, or even teeth that are more than half corroded, and the mothers are still indifferent, thinking that when the baby teeth fall out and permanent teeth are produced, they can be renewed. In fact, this is really too lacking in oral hygiene common sense!</p>
<p>The ideal of most people is that a once-daily local brushing is all that is needed for oral hygiene. How do they know that this is far from the case? Of course, brushing is the best work for oral hygiene, but the choice of toothbrushes and toothpaste, as well as the posture of brushing, are all things that those who pay attention to oral hygiene must pay attention to! We have seen many people who brush their teeth every day, but their teeth are still yellow and decaying. There is no doubt that they are not paying attention to the choice of brushing agents and are using inferior tooth powder and toothpaste. People should know that inferior tooth powder and toothpaste not only have very little effect on killing bacteria, but also enough to damage the enamel of the tooth surface. This is something that I must specially remind general buyers to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The Three Stars toothpaste produced by the China Chemical Industry Society has been sold for nearly 20 years. With its excellent quality and low price, it has been unanimously regarded as a standard brushing agent by most chemists, medical practitioners, and ladies who love hygiene. Recently, in response to social needs, it has created two new products, White Jade Toothpaste and [White Jade Tooth Powder], using the latest scientific methods. Its raw material is [specially made crystalline calcium carbonate], which is refined with various precious preservatives. This [specially made crystalline calcium carbonate], as seen under a microscope, its powder quality is an oval shape. (Ordinary calcium carbonate is angular. Using it to brush your teeth will not only absolutely damage the enamel on the tooth surface, but also give you a sense of freshness on the cavity after use. In the voice of promoting domestic goods, we have such perfect new products in our own country, which is indeed very comforting to the general patriotic compatriots.</p>
<p>As for the brushing movements, avoid horizontal brushing, because this movement cannot clear the dirt in the gingival crevices. Therefore, each time you brush your teeth, the movements must be straight up and down and slightly spiraling, especially the top of the white teeth and the surface of all the teeth must be brushed all over in order to remove tooth stains.</p>
<p>Because ordinary people often neglect it, I specially mention it here for the attention of all readers.</p>

<h3>Deterioration of Japan-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Ever since Japan launched the September 18th Incident, it has seized all the interests of Southern Manchuria, controlled the entire territory of Liaoning and Jilin, and increasingly sought to occupy all of Northern Manchuria with airplanes and encroach on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union felt that it was difficult to deal with, so it proposed selling the railway in the hope of exchanging it for temporary peace, and even made repeated concessions to accommodate Japan. However, Japan’s attitude remained aggressive, so when the Soviet Union proposed selling the railway, most people thought that this move was very unwise. On the one hand, it would only arouse Japan's greater ambitions, and on the other hand, it was feared that it would fall into Japan's conspiracy to increase the status of the puppet state. The effect of delaying the time was not seen, but it promoted its military seizure of the railway. However, the Soviet Union's intention was that, in terms of economic situation, the Chinese Eastern Railway was inevitably threatened by the Southern Manchurian Railway, and it was also restricted by the parallel line of the Jihui Railway. The only thing left was the task of Eurasian connection, and the Manchurian puppet often used the power of the Japanese army to engage in troop transportation under the pretext of suppressing bandits, so that the Chinese Eastern Railway could not carry out its ordinary business. It is better to sell it. Unexpectedly, the Japanese must enter into it without compensation.</p>
<p>What is the reason why the Japanese dare to take such risks, instigate the puppet to seize the railway, and not consider the Soviet counterattack? First, the Japanese militarists deeply knew that the European and American powers were absolutely unable to look east after provoking the Mukden Incident. At the same time, they also knew that Britain and France were worried about the growing power of the Soviet Union. If Japan came out to make things difficult for the Soviet Union, it could win the sympathy of the powers. Second, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was originally the inevitable result of a scorched-earth diplomacy. However, it is certain that Britain and the United States can only diplomatically criticize Japan verbally and will not take practical actions. The Soviet Union, which has the most conflicting interests on the mainland, has completed its first five-year plan. However, the second plan is still in its initial stage. Its strength is not sufficient, so it will never start a war easily. Third, the patriotic fanaticism of militarism originally belonged to a temporary stimulus. Its internal nature is like the injection of morphine, which can only anesthetize and excite for a while. Once the drug wears off, the state of decay is even worse than before. Japan has now fallen into a deep economic panic. If it continues to call for an emergency without actual war, the Japanese warlords will be unable to exercise military power. Therefore, the earlier the war is launched, the more components of victory Japan believes it has. This is why it has repeatedly challenged the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The key now lies in whether the Soviet Union will step forward and respond to the challenge. We can only discuss it based on the current situation. If the Soviet Union publishes the secret documents of the Japanese puppets plotting to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Soviet newspapers strongly criticize the Japanese puppets, the attitude seems to have suddenly changed, and there is a sense of the eve of war. Moreover, the troops stationed in the area from Lake Baikal to the Maritime Province have suddenly increased. According to Japanese investigations, the number exceeds 150,000, and the airfield built near Vladivostok has hundreds of aircraft, including no less than fifty bombing bombers. On the Japanese side, permanent divisions are added to Manchuria, and the sixth division of Kumamoto is transferred. Re-extracting the elite troops, the first and fourth divisions are all transferred to the northeast, intending to deal with the Soviet Union. Therefore, on the surface, the tension in Japan-Soviet relations has reached an extreme. But ah!</p>
<p>Although the tension is extremely tense, the time has not yet arrived. The Soviet Union is still unwilling to easily abandon its peaceful policies today. And today's war is not a simple problem between the two countries, but about the actions of countries around the world, so although the wind is full of the building at the moment, the coming of the mountain rain still has to wait.</p>
<p>Confrontation between Civil and Military Factions</p>
<h3>Wakatsuki's Statement Supports Naval Treaty, Causing Another Stir in Japanese Political Circles: The London Treaty Saves Japan 400 Million Yuan in Burden, While the Navy Ministry Believes Naval Arms Reduction is a Failure</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito Party, made a statement on the London Naval Arms Reduction Treaty at the Nagoya Party Congress. It is now heard that its content roughly stated: I once represented Japan in concluding the London Naval Treaty, and its purpose was for the sake of the country's major plan. I have not changed my belief in this. Because of this treaty, the Japanese people were exempted from a burden of about 400 million yen between Showa 5 and Showa 11. It is difficult for Japan to compete with the United States in strength, and the required funding amounts to tens of millions of yen, which cannot be predicted. Today's urgent need for military expansion has nothing to do with the London Treaty. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Japan chanted the state of emergency, the expansion of the navy's army has been constrained by the London Naval Treaty. The voice of criticism against the London Treaty has gradually increased in the world. Minseito Party President Wakatsuki abandoned his silent attitude and, as Japan's plenipotentiary at the time, published his beliefs about the London Treaty to the world. This matter gave a major impression to all aspects of the political circles. Even the statements of the defendants in court at the recent May 15th Incident all chanted the defense defects in accordance with the London Treaty and criticized the measures taken by the government at the time. At the time when a part of the world also intended to recognize this claim, President Wakatsuki suddenly asserted that there was no fact of interfering with the command, and its impact on the political circles was significant, and the future is quite worthy of attention. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Criticisms of the Navy Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy authorities criticized the explanations given by Seiyukai President Wakatsuki regarding the London Treaty as follows: Wakatsuki's explanations can generally be affirmed. The three principles Japan advocated at the time, namely (1) a total of 70% against the United States, (2) 70% of large cruisers, and (3) maintaining the existing strength of 77,800 tons of submarines, emphasized the first item, the total of 70% against the United States, while underestimating the third item of submarines. It can be said that their understanding was insufficient. Because the existing submarine force of 77,800 tons at the time of the treaty was reduced by 25,000 tons to 52,800 tons, the same rate as the United States, which put Japan at a disadvantage in Pacific operations. As a result, the first and second supplementary plans were created, which were not just the result of recent changes in the international situation as Mr. Wakatsuki claimed. The same is true of the issue of violating the right of supreme command. However, the Navy does not want to complain now that it is a "dead child," but must express its opinions, and the entire nation must be united and prepared to cope with the future. (Twelfth Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President Wakatsuki's speech in Nagoya touched upon the London Naval Treaty. The Navy Ministry, believing that his speech had an impact on the current situation, issued the following unofficial opinion: Judging from the current situation, the London Treaty was a failure. Although President Wakatsuki claimed it was a success, the treaty on the issue of 8-inch gun cruisers and submarines was far from Japan's demands. Therefore, it has been necessary to implement large-scale supplementary plans to make up for its shortcomings. In addition, defense expenditures such as the modernization of various warships and the strengthening of air squadrons have greatly increased. President Wakatsuki's interpretation of Article 18 of the London Treaty is inaccurate. Wakatsuki claimed that the United States would build fifteen 8-inch gun cruisers before the summer of 1936, but in fact, the United States could build sixteen. Therefore, the ratio of Japanese to American navies is ten to six, which is lower than it is now. (Twelfth Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>Rebuttals from the Seiyukai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Wakatsuki, president of the Minseito party, made opinions regarding the London Naval Treaty in Nagoya. Yesterday, the Seiyukai issued a rebuttal statement in the name of Shinya Uchida, director of the National Defense Department of the Policy Affairs Research Council, as follows: (1) When Mr. Wakatsuki attended the London Conference, in the presence of the British Emperor, he said, "What Japan cares about is that the nation's sense of security is not shaken." However, today, the nation's sense of security has already been shaken. (2) He strongly emphasized the merit of postponing the construction of replacement battleships, but this was decided in the pre-conference between Britain and the United States. (3) The Naval General Staff once stated that concessions on 8-inch gun cruisers could not be made below 70% against the United States, but in the end, the decision was made as a significant concession, which harms the nation's sense of security. Moreover, Mr. Wakatsuki's interpretation of the treaty is also flawed. (4) Regarding submarines, he said that although there was an American proposal to abolish them completely, they were ultimately able to maintain 52,800 tons, the same rate as Britain and the United States, which is cause for great joy that they were able to share the same rate with what the other side does not use, and what is most useful to our side, is extremely wrong. (5) Regarding the issue of violating the right of supreme command, Prime Minister Hamaguchi consulted the intentions of the military in the Diet, and the Chief of the Naval General Staff expressed regret at the time of his resignation that he had not completed his responsibility to assist the Emperor. This is clearly a fact of violation. (Twelfth Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of deliberations by the leadership of the Seiyukai, it was decided to refute the arguments of Wakatsuki, president of the Minseito party, regarding the London Treaty and to express the attitude of the Seiyukai, that is, to issue a rebuttal statement in the name of Uchida, Director of National Defense. The intention is based on past facts to correct Wakatsuki's errors. The issue of Wakatsuki's responsibility for concluding the treaty will not be questioned for the time being. However, since Wakatsuki has publicly stated his beliefs as the leader of a party, Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, will also need to publicly refute his arguments at an appropriate time. This speech by Suzuki will be given at the Kanto Convention or the Tohoku Convention to be held on the 10th. The political party coalition movement, in which the Seiyukai and the Minseito parties have been enthusiastically working on recently, will inevitably be hit and come to a standstill as a result. (Twelfth Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito party believes that Wakatsuki's speech aimed to dispel the misunderstandings in the world regarding the London Treaty, and was not a challenge to the Seiyukai. Therefore, although the Seiyukai issued a rebuttal statement, it decided to remain silent for the time being and observe the progress of the political situation. (Twelfth Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Jiang Visited Hirota Yesterday; The Hour-Long Discussion Was Not Announced</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Republic of China's Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuozhi, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 am this morning and left around noon after an hour of discussions. (Twelfth Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, Ambassador Jiang visited Foreign Minister Hirota today to exchange opinions. Regarding Japan's policy toward China, it mainly emphasizes direct negotiations. Because the emotions of the people on both sides have not yet calmed down, overall negotiations will be avoided for the time being. The settlement of the North China issue will be the initial contact. After the initial negotiations are successful, a comprehensive solution will be sought. Ambassador Arima and Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, are ordered to go to Peiping to negotiate with Huang Fu as the counterpart on the following issues:</p>
<p>(1) Railway connection issues;</p>
<p>(2) Postal connection issues;</p>
<p>(3) Post-war issues in the war zone.</p>
<p>Japan wants to use this type of negotiation to implicitly make our side recognize the puppet organization. The contents of the contact between Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Jiang will not be disclosed for the time being. (Twelfth Dispatch from the China United Press)</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Navy Aircraft Collide and Crash into the Sea During Exercises: One Body Recovered, One Missing</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Navy Ministry, at 8:50 AM this morning, ten-odd fighters from the Omura Naval Air Group in Kyushu</p>
<p>were engaged in combat training at Omura Training Unit. During a mixed aerial battle, two planes piloted by Petty Officer 1st Class Kawakami and Petty Officer 1st Class Matsuoka collided in mid-air and crashed into the sea. Kawakami's body has been recovered; Matsuoka's whereabouts are still unknown. (Twelfth Dispatch from the China United Press)</p>

<h3>Precarious Relations between Japan and Russia Attract Global Attention: Conspiracy Documents Exposed; Japan Threatens Russia; Seeks Apology and Withdrawal; Expulsion of TASS Reporter Under Consideration</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, when a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke to reporters, he did not express whether he was satisfied with the explanation given by the Tokyo TASS correspondent yesterday during inspection. However, he stated that Foreign Minister Hirota is currently considering what measures to take, or [temporarily] cannot decide. When asked what kind of instructions the Japanese government will send to Ota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, and whether the consent of the Japanese cabinet will be sought before the instructions are issued, he replied that it is still under consideration. The spokesperson stated that the Tokyo TASS correspondent published the so-called "General Hishikari Documents" after their authenticity had been denied, which aroused the anger of the authorities. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the reporter's actions from both a political and technical standpoint. As for the Soviet Union's publication of such documents, the Japanese government has decided to handle it independently and not to mix it with the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Twelfth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Soviet [Union]'s accusation of Japan's North Manchurian conspiracy, which is intentionally damaging Japan's position, after discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military, and the Ministry of Home Affairs, it is reported that the attitude to be taken has been decided as follows: (1) The Soviet Union's sudden slander of Japan is mainly due to the Soviet government's lack of understanding of the true situation in North Manchuria. Their behavior is detrimental to the dignity of the Japanese nation and requires a cancellation and apology to restore the losses suffered by Japan in international diplomacy. (2) If the Soviet government is willing to acknowledge Japan's demands, Japan will take decisive measures to achieve this goal. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not in a position to decide on the actions of the TASS correspondent in Tokyo; it will be handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs as a matter of domestic law. If the correspondent has violated the law, he will be dealt with according to national law; otherwise, no punishment will be imposed. (Twelfth Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<h3>Stalled Negotiations Between Russia and the Puppet State on the Purchase of the Railway</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian-[Manchu] negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway are on the verge of crisis as a result of the Soviet Union's publication of the so-called "Hishikari Report to Tokyo." Japan claims that [Manchukuo]'s plan regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway is completely unrelated to the Tokyo railway conference, but the Soviet Union claims that the two matters cannot be separated and has refused to continue the conference with [Manchu]. If the situation does not change, Japan seems likely to relinquish its role as mediator between the two parties. (Twelfth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspapers Comment: The Truth of the Documents Is Indisputable; Japan's Embarrassment Is Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's newspaper "Izvestia" commented on the initial responses of Japanese newspapers as follows: "When TASS published Japanese official documents, the Japanese press immediately claimed that these documents were forged. This attempt is not only ridiculous but can only indicate the extreme embarrassment of all parties involved. The authors of the reports that have been made public, namely General Hishikari, commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, and Morita, the Japanese consul-general in Harbin, have not rushed to deny their veracity. They are clearly in an awkward position and are waiting for instructions from above. The comments of the Japanese press and the recent remarks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman to the press all prove that these documents are indisputable and at the same time indicate how profound an impression these documents have made. A portion of the Japanese documents published by TASS exposes the aggressive actions carried out by the Japanese authorities in Manchuria under the direct command of Tokyo, and this publication also solemnly expresses the Soviet government's determination to defend Soviet rights and interests." (Eleventh Dispatch from TASS)</p>
<h3>American Military Opinions: Russia Is Building Up Strength; No Worries in the West; Far Eastern Position Is More Solid Than Before</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is believed here that the Japanese-Russian conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway and Moscow's actions to expose Japan's ambitions can be seen as a clear sign that the Soviet Union feels its position in the Far East is more solid than before after concluding non-aggression treaties in the West. Although the U.S. State Department does not wish to comment on the Japanese-Russian conflict, other officials say that the Soviet Union likely foresaw the conflict in the Far East months ago and therefore rushed to conclude non-aggression treaties in Europe. Someone familiar with the situation in the Far East even said that the Soviet Union's security in the West clearly means that it has the mind to unsheathe its sword in the Far East. However, it is believed that the situation is not yet very serious, because military experts predict that neither Japan nor Russia will be willing to start a war in the dead of winter. Several others believe that neither Japan nor Russia has any real intention of waging war at this time. One military expert stated that the Soviet Union's military position in the Far East is not yet capable of waging a large-scale war, because the number of Russian troops stationed in Siberia is not large. Once a war breaks out, the Russians will have to defend at the end of the world's longest railway. American newspapers are paying equal attention to the Soviet Union's claims and Japan's denials. Several commentators predict that there will be serious disputes in the future. (Eleventh Dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan and the United States Conclude an Arbitration Treaty</h3>
<p>Reasons for Opposition from the Japanese Navy Ministry</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is proposed to conclude a Japanese-American arbitration treaty between Ishii and President Roosevelt to prevent war between Japan and the United States. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota met with Viscount Ishii on the 9th, and at that time, especially listened to Ishii's opinions on this point. He also presented his views on the treaty at the Five Ministers Conference. However, it is contrary to the Navy's position advocated by Navy Minister Osumi. Therefore, the Navy's policy toward the United States and the Army's policy toward Russia are both regarded as obstacles to the Five Ministers Conference. Therefore, the opinions at the Five Ministers Conference on the 16th may still be inconsistent, so its future is worthy of attention. As for the opinions of the Navy, they are generally as follows: (1) The so-called arbitration treaty, also known as the non-aggression treaty, in short, Japan and the United States must respect each other. If the national defense forces are different and the people lose their sense of security, a formal non-aggression treaty is meaningless. (2) The work of Japan and the United States towards peace cannot reduce the degree of strengthening naval armaments. (3) If war breaks out between Japan and the United States, the reasons will be problems such as the recognition of [Manchu], the naval power ratio, and the South Seas mandate. If these problems are not resolved, an abstract peace treaty cannot simply be concluded. (4) Also, this problem seems to be relatively unimportant in the United States, but it is a matter of life and death in Japan. If a peace treaty is concluded, and the situation is such that it is necessary to resort to non-peaceful means, then Japan will be stained with the infamy of breaking the treaty. (Eleventh Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Guarantee Security: Ishii Advised Hirota That a US-Japan War Would Be Mutually Destructive</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Viscount Ishii returned to the country from the London Economic Conference. After arriving in Tokyo on the morning of the 9th, he visited Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Hirota on the same day. In addition to reporting on the progress of the economic conference, he also advised the government on major diplomatic policies. When Ishii stayed in the United States, he deeply felt that the feelings of the United States towards Japan were deteriorating day by day. He had informally proposed to President Roosevelt to sign a US-Japan arbitration treaty. Although the United States and Japan have not mentioned this matter again since then, Foreign Minister Hirota, since taking office, has also been deeply concerned about the gradual aggravation of US-Japan relations. In order to prevent a head-on conflict with the United States at the next disarmament conference from 1935 to 1936, it is necessary to reach a security guarantee agreement with the United States in advance. Therefore, Ishii's advice greatly moved Hirota. Also, according to Ishii, if Japan and the United States go to war, the world will fall into unprecedented chaos, and the tragedy is unimaginable. Whether Japan and the United States win or lose, they will inevitably suffer together. Also, if Japan and the United States declare war, if the Japanese army wants to attack the United States, it must cross the Pacific Ocean, and the US military must do the same. This kind of war that can only be engaged after a voyage of more than ten thousand miles, the precedent of the past can be taken as a warning. Japan and the United States must not come up with this stupid strategy. Each can only attack the other's merchant ships with submarines and destroyers. The war period must not be delayed, so that a third country in between can profit, and as a result, Japan and the United States will both lose. For this reason, Ishii advised Hirota to actively seek peace with the United States to avoid fighting Russia at the same time. (Communication from the China United Press)</p>
<h3>British Conservatives Suspect the Soviet Union and Worry About Japan; Consistently Maintain a Laissez-Faire Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Some conservative newspapers here are ignoring the Soviet Union's documents accusing Japan of plotting to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, and are all publishing the Japanese government's denial. These newspapers have always supported government policies, which has aroused numerous comments from outsiders. Some correspondents have even asked government spokespersons whether this move by the newspaper is influenced by the British government. Officials naturally ridiculed these concerns. As a result, the general opinion is that most conservative newspapers believe that what the Soviet Union published is forged, and it is heard that at least one newspaper is convinced that this document was forged by the Soviet Union. In addition, several newspapers that have always paid close attention to the Japanese-Russian conflict have said that at this time, the Soviet Union's preoccupation with internal affairs and Japan's financial position both make an actual war unlikely to occur. However, the growing power of the Japanese military in the government makes it difficult to predict the situation. (Eleventh Dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji's Conversation with Reuters Reporters: Hope for British Awareness, Saying Laissez-Faire towards Japan Will Endanger India's Position; Advocates Holding an International Conference on China</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji will leave here tomorrow to return to his post. Today, he told Reuters that all the powers are currently pursuing a laissez-faire policy in China, especially Britain. Britain has great interests in China and has long been friendly with the Chinese people. Its current policy is actually contrary to this. Dr. Shi also strongly stated that Far Eastern affairs are urgently related to the whole world. When European affairs are relatively settled in the future, an international conference on China should be held, and special attention should be paid to the future of Shanghai, because of the current position of Japan, this move is absolutely necessary. The powers have different positions towards Japan, but it is actually impossible for an island nation to resist the common attitude of the powers. He dared to say that the leaders of India are also closely watching the policies implemented by Britain in China. Indians are determined to exclude Japan. He meant that if Britain makes concessions to Japan in China, it will have extremely bad effects on the policies implemented by Britain in India and its future position. Dr. Shi concluded that China earnestly hopes that Britain will promote its ambassador to China to the rank of ambassador. He still remembers that the United States had planned to propose this in 1928, but unfortunately Britain was unable to follow suit at that time, so the proposal was shelved. However, when he spoke with President Roosevelt this summer, he saw from his tone that the United States seemed to be planning to re-raise the issue this winter. (Eleventh Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Observe: The Complex Behind the Scenes of the Japan-Russia Problem; Diplomatic Conflict Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspaper "Le Temps" published a special article on the situation in the Far East, saying that "Some countries, especially Britain and the United States, cannot remain indifferent to the breakdown of the balance of power in the Far East. These countries cannot allow a certain force to dominate exclusively within a certain part of the world, and allow their interests to be threatened by it. Japan should be able to understand this. What is happening now is the Japan-Russia problem, but behind this problem, there may be a broader and more complex Pacific problem. Some say that there are world diplomatic problems that are even more difficult than the current Chinese Eastern Railway problem, but with proper diplomatic maneuvering, subtle solutions have been achieved. Based on this, the conflict between Japan and Russia may be avoided by flexible diplomatic means. This statement is indeed credible, but we should always pay attention to the relationship between Japan and Russia, and international people, to a certain extent, are so anxious, we can get an explanation from the irritability of Moscow and Tokyo." (Eleventh Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers are paying close attention to the conflict between Japan and Russia, and believe that although the relations between the two countries are very tense now, hostile behavior may be avoided. The newspapers also said that Germany wants to take advantage of the exposure of the breakdown of relations between the two countries to reap the benefits. "Le Journal" said that Moscow definitely wants to avoid conflict. Russia is extremely afraid of war, and Japan may not take this adventurous move. It can be seen that Japan and the Soviet Union may compete fiercely in diplomacy, but it is hoped that a breakdown from competition can be avoided. "Le Petit Journal" said that in order to preserve its own survival, the Soviet government must maintain peace for a long time and will never listen to Germany's conspiracy to endanger peace. The Chinese Eastern Railway, far in the East, has no significant value to Russia. Russia cannot endanger peace in order to preserve this railway. (Twelfth Dispatch from Havas)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Planes Train for Long-Distance Flight: Flight from Japan to Korea Takes More Than Eight Hours; Preparation for War Against Russia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Type 87 heavy bomber of the Hamamatsu Air Group took off from Hamamatsu at 4:50 this morning, flew over the Sea of Japan to Pyongyang, and arrived in Pyongyang, Korea at 1:10 PM today. The time required was 8 hours and 20 minutes, which is two hours earlier than the scheduled time. The plane plans to fly back to its original unit at 7:00 AM on the 14th. The Japanese Navy flew from Yokosuka to Rajin last month, and this time the Army flew to Pyongyang to train for long-distance flight, all as a demonstration and preparation against Russia.

<h3>Military Disarmament Faces New Twists: Britain, America, and France Reject Germany's Military Buildup</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Unexpected developments have arisen in Geneva. Britain and France have agreed to jointly reject Germany's demands. Consequently, German representative Nadolny and British representative Simon were compelled to re-exchange views. The two representatives are scheduled to meet again tomorrow. German newspapers are advising the government and German representatives to remain calm and not forget that Italy is still adopting a neutral stance. The discussions underway in Rome are also very important. It appears that the major powers at Geneva do not share the same unified opinion as widely reported. Some criticize Britain's attitude, arguing that Iraq is permitted to possess military aircraft, so why is Germany uniquely denied this right? It is believed that Rome will issue an opinion on this matter. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The hopes that the League of Nations could break the deadlock in the disarmament conference seem to have vanished again. The conference among Britain, America, and France is said to have decided unanimously to reject Germany's request to increase its military strength. According to reports from the British side, the delegations of the three countries feel that the situation has fundamentally changed since the recent successful reform movement in Germany. If the disarmament conference does not engage in reducing armaments but instead allows Germany to restore its military strength, it would be difficult for world public opinion to understand. If this rumor is confirmed, then the breakdown of the disarmament conference will be announced. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Zhengyi Evening News" published an article by German Foreign Minister Neurath, strongly refuting foreign reports that the new German revolution has created a new situation for disarmament, requiring countries to deal with Germany with stern measures. He stated that Germany must insist that all countries fulfill their obligations regarding disarmament, and achieving this is the only hope for the disarmament conference. Germany's proposal is that all countries' armaments should be reduced to the same level as Germany's armaments stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. This is the simplest way to solve the problem, but countries refuse to consider Germany's current situation. France, again leading the way, defines offensive and defensive weapons to seek its own benefit, allowing it to maintain all its offensive weapons. In this situation, Germany believes it is responsible for defending itself because Germany's demand for security is the same as that of other countries. Germany unreservedly accepts British Prime Minister MacDonald's security plan but cannot submit to being unarmed in an armed world. Germany is willing to have its armaments subject to time-limited supervision, provided that this supervision is equally applied to all countries through treaties. However, Germany cannot accept unilateral supervision under any circumstances, as this is equivalent to prolonging the humiliating policies of the post-war era. This policy, now unanimously opposed by the entire German nation, is bound to fail. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 14th session of the League of Nations Assembly has closed, but even during the final period before its adjournment, everyone's attention was focused on preliminary talks before the resumption of the disarmament conference. Many talks took place today. In the afternoon, French representative Paul-Boncour met with American representative Davis, and then with Italian representative to the disarmament conference, Suvlahnia. British representative Simon also contacted Italian representative Suvlahnia. Finally, the representatives of France, Britain, and America gathered for talks from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. This matter was inadvertently revealed by someone, but it is of great importance. The national representatives discussed the disarmament issue. No official announcement was made, but official sources stated that the three countries' representatives are all against rearmament. After the talks, British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson. Although the representatives remained tight-lipped about the talks, the general impression seemed satisfactory. The concerns caused by Germany's oral response to the British government have been dispelled, and the alliance between Britain, America, France, and Italy has been further solidified. Italian representative Suvlahnia personally stated that Italy shares the same views as Britain, France, and America, and that they are very close regarding the content of the negotiations. Therefore, from now on, the focus should be on the procedures to be adopted in the disarmament conference. There are some principles that Germany must first acknowledge, otherwise, further discussions will be futile. The only unresolved issue is whether Germany should be asked to publicly and clearly express its opinions on these principles before discussing the revised British disarmament plan at the future meeting. If Germany does not acknowledge these principles, then the disarmament conference should decide in advance what attitude to take regarding the fate of the conference, and the representatives of Britain, America, France, and Italy should pre-negotiate a resolution to determine this. (Havas News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly closed today. Chairman Walsh stated that although the efforts of politicians and economists have been ineffective, the world is gradually showing its instinct for recovery. All countries should change their policies, transforming anxiety and resentment into generosity, as the British have done in South Africa, so that the world can achieve peace. The desire to improve living conditions is gaining momentum in all countries, and the ideology of destroying others is gradually being defeated. The final meeting of the League of Nations Assembly was very different from the opening meeting. At the opening meeting, the Norwegian representative made alarming remarks, saying that the danger of war was imminent and that disarmament should be sought quickly. Now that the assembly has closed, there is an opportunity to actively discuss the disarmament issue. British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Geneva from London today and immediately met with French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and later with American representative Davis. In the afternoon, the British and French representatives met again and are said to have agreed that Germany's rearmament during the initial phase specified in the disarmament draft treaty cannot be approved.

<h3>Competition between British and Japanese Silk Industries: Japanese are Skilled at Imitating and Seizing British Markets</h3>
<p>(London) The Federation of Industries has published a report on the extremely adverse impact of silk industry competition on the British silk industry. It states that Japanese industrialists previously only manufactured purely Eastern-style silk fabrics. However, in the past two or three years, they have also imitated European products, especially those in which the British silk industry excels, such as [Chinese silk], silk scarves, and silk handkerchiefs. Their working conditions (referring to labor and working hours) are absolutely impossible for Britain to compete with. In view of this, the Federation of Industries has unanimously resolved to urgently request the government to immediately restrict Japanese imports, either by using import quotas or by completely prohibiting imports, so that British silk factories can avoid closing down.

<h3>Attempt to Assassinate Romanian King with Gunfire: Turns Out to Be Guard's False Report</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph correspondent in Bucharest telegraphed this morning that someone attempted to assassinate Romanian King Carol by firing a gun at an express train, mistaking it for the train carrying the king. Later, the Associated Press correspondent in Vienna inquired with officials in Bucharest and confirmed this statement. According to the British newspaper correspondent, someone, after the train left Targoviste City, was lurking beside the tracks and fired at the train. Fortunately, both shots hit empty cars and did not injure anyone. The king was traveling in a special train that had passed five minutes earlier. It was announced that the king would pass through Targoviste City, and the rioters expected the king's car to be behind the express train, so they ambushed the second train. Afterward, the authorities immediately dispatched troops to search the vicinity but did not find anyone, and they are believed to have hidden in civilian homes. According to a message from the German newspaper union correspondent in Beijing, the Romanian government has denied that rioters wanted to attack the king's car, but did not mention whether the rioters attacked another train. (National Dispatch, 12th)</p>

The train guard, in order to shirk his personal responsibility for the breakage of several windows of the car, fabricated the rumor that the train had been attacked. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Confiscates Guns from Northeast Civilians, Inciting Civil Unrest: Over Five Thousand People Form Anti-Japanese Army to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has been extremely eager to consolidate its military, political, and economic power and position in the Northeast. However, due to the uprising of righteous armies, fighting to the death with the Japanese and puppet forces, the Japanese have not been able to fully realize their vicious policies. After the anti-Japanese generals Ma Su, Li, and Wang retreated to Russia last winter, the anti-Japanese forces in the Northeast gradually became scattered. Although there were small groups of righteous armies, they could only lie dormant in the mountains, waiting for an opportunity to move. During this period, in order to fundamentally eliminate the anti-Japanese forces, the Japanese implemented the confiscation of civilian guns. Now that the green crops in the Northeast have fallen, it is even easier for mounted righteous armies to operate. In order to prevent this, the Japanese issued a general order to the Japanese advisors and puppet county magistrates in each county to confiscate civilian guns under the pretext of checking the serial numbers on the guns. Upon hearing the news, the villagers of Daan, Zhaozhou, Zhaodong, and three other counties in Heilongjiang Province immediately convened a meeting of the village chiefs and decided to resist the Japanese army's confiscation of guns. All armed forces were mobilized and joined forces with various righteous armies, reaching more than five thousand people, and engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Japanese and puppet troops. It is also reported that the internal organization is strict, and many young students have gone to participate. Bullets are purchased from Russia, and there are five heavy machine guns, giving them a strong momentum. Wherever they go, they never disturb the villagers and have organized propaganda teams, secretly sending personnel to various villages to carry out propaganda in order to gain the belief and assistance of the people. Recently, they plan to attack Daan. The Japanese advisor stationed in Daan urgently telegraphed the Kwantung Army headquarters in Harbin for help. The righteous army removed more than fifty telegraph poles between Changchun and Daan County to prevent the Japanese and puppet forces from urgently seeking assistance. The Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Daan are currently only defending the city and dare not go down to the countryside to search. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the righteous army is expanding further, secretly going to various places to gather anti-Japanese patriots, waiting for their strength to be consolidated, and then fighting to the death with the Japanese and puppet forces.

<h3>Inner Mongolia Autonomy Is Easing: Most Mongolian Princes and Nobles Lean Towards the Central Government, Prince De and Others Re-Convene at Bailing Temple, Zhangjia to Go to Mongolia for Pacification in the Near Future</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping: Prince De, Deputy League Leader of the Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia, Chahar Province, incited by a certain party, advocated autonomy and convened a meeting in Bailing Temple in August, expressing his views. However, most of the princes and nobles were very clear about righteousness, and very few who were persuaded to attend the meeting. Prince De, seeing that few agreed with him, re-issued letters and telegrams, inviting the princes and nobles of various leagues and banners and Mongolian representatives scattered in various places to convene a meeting in Pangjiang on September 28th. However, because the number of people who could attend was still not enough, the meeting was postponed again and changed to a re-convening in Bailing Temple on the 8th of this month. Whether it has been successfully convened is still unknown due to inconvenient transportation. Since the call for Inner Mongolian autonomy was publicized, all parties have paid extraordinary attention. Ever since Prince De lost Jehol, he has been incited by a certain party and harbored intentions of making changes. The autonomy he is advocating is superficially consistent with the central government, and he claims to implement autonomy based on Sun Yat-sen's nation-building program, but this is actually just a slogan.</p>
<p>Although Prince De has some influence in Inner Mongolia, he is a newcomer. After advocating autonomy, very few princes and nobles responded. Among the Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia, Chahar Province, Prince Suo and Prince Zhuo are the most respected. These two princes are quite clear about righteousness and are still sincerely supporting the central government without any other intentions. If the central government can handle it properly, there will be no problem. It is said that the central government has carefully considered this matter, taking measures to improve Han-Mongolian relations on the one hand and earnestly conducting propaganda on the other. Most advocate that autonomy should be granted within a considerable scope under the guidance of the central government, so that Han-Mongolian relations can be further improved. At the same time, senior officials are sent to Inner Mongolia to publicize virtues and intentions and eliminate misunderstandings. After Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar Province returned to Chahar from Peiping a few days ago, he immediately sent Xiao Zhenying as a representative to the Xilingol League for some explanation, and the result was satisfactory. On the central government's side, in addition to selecting and dispatching senior officials, it also urged the Mongolian Banner Pacification Envoy, Zhangjia Khutukhtu Living Buddha, to make a trip to Mongolia. Zhangjia, stationed in Mount Wutai in Shanxi, went to Taiyuan from Mount Wutai after receiving the telegram and discussed matters with Yan Xishan. He arrived in Peiping from Taiyuan at 7:00 a.m. on the 5th, and met with He Yingqin and Huang Fu on the 6th to discuss the matter of going to Mongolia for pacification. At a.m. on the 7th, Huang invited Zhangjia to Fengze Garden again to talk for an hour. Around the time of Zhangjia's arrival in Peiping, he sent a telegram to the league leaders and banner leaders of Inner Mongolia, as well as the general managers of each banner, advising the princes and nobles of Inner Mongolia not to listen to rumors and go astray. At present, when the country is in trouble, the central and local governments must work together to benefit both the country and the people. Finally, he also said that he intended to personally go to Mongolia for a trip. It is said that Zhangjia plans to stay in Peiping for a short period of time to discuss everything in detail with the Peiping military and political authorities. After the princes and nobles of Inner Mongolia have sent a reply telegram to Peiping, he will then enter Chahar and go to Mongolia for earnest pacification. On the 8th, various charitable organizations in Peiping welcomed Zhangjia at the Laijin Yuxuan in Central Park. During the banquet, Chen Liang, a representative of various charitable organizations, delivered a welcome speech, hoping that Zhangjia's trip to Mongolia would, in addition to promoting Buddhism, further promote harmony between the Han and Mongolian people and prevent them from being instigated by foreign tribes and going astray. Zhangjia expressed his views on the spot and issued a written speech as follows: [I am very grateful for everyone's warm welcome today. You all practice Buddhism and always do things with the purpose of peace and compassion. When our country is uneasy and society is corrupt, if we can do things based on Buddhism, not only will our country not be invaded by violence, but also world peace will depend on it to be maintained. Today, I look up to all Buddhas in the ten directions and three worlds, all sentient beings in the world, to bless and have mercy, so that this world can be free from suffering and share the blessings of the Dharma. All phenomena in the human world, whether pure or impure, are created by the wishes of mankind and formed by common karma. If we want to save people, save the country, and save the world, it only depends on everyone's vows and efforts, and it is not impossible. Now that the borders are troubled and internal and external troubles are coming one after another, my trip to Mongolia to promote Buddhism is to be based on the original intention of settling matters and calming people, so that they do not create more troubles and maintain today's peaceful world. I hope everyone will give guidance from time to time]. (October 8th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu Provincial Government Assumed Office Yesterday: All Department Heads and Commissioners Assumed Office at the Same Time, the Central Government Sent Zhang Ji to Supervise the Oath and Deliver a Speech</h3>
<p>Chen Guofu, the newly appointed chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and nine members, including Gu Renfa, concurrently the head of the Civil Affairs Department; Zhao Dihua, concurrently the head of the Finance Department; Shen Baixian, concurrently the head of the Construction Department; Zhou Fohai, concurrently the head of the Education Department; Cheng Tianfang, concurrently the Secretary-General; Yu Jingtang; Luo Liangjian; and Wang Boling, arrived in Zhenjiang at 9:25 on the 12th by express train from Nanjing. Representatives of various agencies and groups and the public went to the station to welcome them. Chen and others got off the train amidst military music and, after briefly greeting the welcomers, accompanied Zhang Ji, the oath supervisor sent by the central government, to the provincial government by car. At 10:15, the oath-taking ceremony was held, with all officials from the provincial government's departments and offices participating. After the meeting began, Chen Guofu first led all the members to take the oath, and then the oath supervisor Zhang Ji successively conferred the seals and delivered a speech, which said in brief: [In recent years, the country has been in trouble, with internal and external troubles. Jiangsu is at the forefront. Comrade Gu's efforts to maintain it have been highly admired by the central government as one of the most important cadres of our party. Now, due to his transfer to an important position in bandit suppression, he cannot continue to govern Jiangsu's politics. Therefore, the central government has appointed Comrade Chen Guofu to succeed him in Jiangsu. Chen has served our party and has been through hardships for ten years as one day. His personal energy is used for the country and doctrine at all times. This is well known to the public and does not need to be mentioned. Jiangsu is a land of culture, and its finances are more abundant than other provinces. Now, after internal and external troubles, we must cultivate rural self-defense forces based on the Prime Minister's instructions. Only when farmers have self-defense can they seek autonomy, and then they can help the government govern everything. Popularizing national education is also one of the most important administrative affairs. The majority of Chinese people are illiterate. Illiterate citizens cannot have a national and ethnic concept. The reason why there are so many Chinese traitors is because of this. If we earnestly implement the above two methods, the country will always have a turning point. Now, at the beginning of Comrade Chen's assumption of office, I would like to offer my views for reference.] After Zhang finished his speech, Lan Weibin, the representative of the provincial party headquarters, delivered a speech, hoping for political clarification and strengthening of national power. Finally, Chen Guofu delivered a reply, which said in brief: [I and others were ordered by the central government to take charge of Jiangsu's politics, and I am very apprehensive. In the past, Comrades Ye and Gu have established a considerable foundation in Jiangsu. In the future, we can only do it step by step, without seeking credit or fame, focusing on the welfare of the people, and using people and money in the most economical way to achieve the greatest effect. Everything should be scientific. Regarding all administrative affairs, we will conduct a thorough investigation based on previous achievements, formulate an overall plan, and hope that the people and the government will cooperate to achieve great progress. I am deeply grateful to the representatives of the people who came to the station to welcome us today. There are many things to learn in the future, and I hope that all the elders and comrades in the province will supervise and guide us from time to time]. The ceremony ended at 11:30, and the meeting was adjourned after a photo was taken. (12th)</p>
<h3>Tragedy in Guiyang: Car Runs Over and Kills Students: Two Students Dead, More Than Forty Injured, More Than Fifty Arrested, Still Not Released</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The internal strife in Guizhou Province, after the persuasion of neighboring provinces, has temporarily ceased, but the entire province is divided into four parts, creating de facto defense zones. The western route is You Guocai, the northern route is Jiang Zaizhen, and the eastern route is Che Mingyi, Lei Mingjiu, and Yang Qichang, all of whom cannot cooperate with Chairman Wang Jialie. Wang then mobilized heavy troops in the provincial capital for self-defense. Although the taxes in the province are extremely heavy, the public revenue is only enough for the extravagance of one faction of the authorities. All government expenses are not available. Any official only receives ten yuan a month. Such a situation is unprecedented. Education funds have not been paid for half a year. On the September 18th Anniversary, students from various schools, driven by patriotism, gathered for a parade. Tan Xingge, the head of the Education Department, failed to dissuade them beforehand and panicked in the face of the event. When the students were parading, he sent troops armed with guns to occupy the street corners, and used multiple cars to rush into the ranks, intending to disperse the ranks. As a result, a tragedy occurred, killing two students and injuring more than forty, mostly students from Zhengyi Elementary School, who were only around ten years old. In addition, more than fifty students were arrested and have not been released to this day, believing that the students' parade had other purposes. After the event, postal and telecommunications were strictly inspected, so that for more than twenty days, the victims had no way to appeal. Those who participated in the incident dared to speak only after arriving in Chongqing, which can be described as tragic. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Changes in Cultural Relics of Mount Tai: Provincial Government Decides to Move to Jinan for Preservation, Taian Residents Request to Keep Them in Taian for Exhibition</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Mount Tai is respected among the Five Mountains, and the Dai Temple is famous in Shandong Province. People call it a treasure trove of epigraphy. Its famous plants include Qin Pines, Han Cypresses, Tang Locusts, and Six Dynasties Pines. Its famous epigraphy includes Qin Stone, Tang Cliff Inscriptions, Northern Qi Stone Sutras, and Song Dynasty Wall Paintings. Therefore, when climbing Mount Tai, people all stroke and browse them. As for the cultural relics sealed by the Taian Zhongshan Market Management Committee, those who do not know think they are treasures from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Ming dynasty, but in fact, they are the furnishings of the Dai Temple for worshiping Mount Tai in the Qing dynasty. According to historical records, the display of offerings for worshiping Mount Tai did not begin in the Qing dynasty. The Tang dynasty offered wine vessels and jade, the Yuan dynasty offered silver boxes and golden banners, and the Ming dynasty offered golden boxes and silk banners, all of which have disappeared. Only the offerings of the Qing dynasty remain. After the establishment of the Republic of China, they were managed by the local finance bureau, which selected and displayed them for people to view. The five offerings, seven treasures, and eight auspicious objects, the cooked pit copper furnace, and the porcelain bottles with Qianlong inscriptions were all commonly seen by tourists from far and near. The most famous Great Jade Tablet is displayed in the Daoyuan of the Dai Temple, packed in a wooden box and covered with yellow silk, carefully protected. This Great Jade Tablet is divided into three sections. The upper section is made of green jade and is pentagonal. The middle section is also made of green jade and is rectangular, engraved with the four characters "Qianlong Yuzhi" (Made by Qianlong). The lower section is also rectangular and is black and yellow in color. The three sections are combined into one tablet, about one meter long, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, thicker at the top and thinner at the bottom, engraved with three star patterns. The jade is warm and cool, hence the name "Warm and Cool Jade". Taian's businesses and innkeepers often use "Warm and Cool Jade" in their publicity to attract travelers and make money. In fact, it is not a treasure. In 1928, the provincial government moved to Taian, and Chairman Sun Liangcheng changed the front yard of the Dai Temple into Zhongshan Market and the backyard into a park, establishing the Zhongshan Park Preparatory Committee to manage everything. The Qing dynasty sacrificial utensils were included in the committee, intending to be displayed in the back hall of the park. Before the construction was completed, he left office in the spring of 1929. Local gentry organized the Zhongshan Market Board of Directors Committee to inherit the responsibilities of the preparatory committee and manage all affairs of the Zhongshan Market. The Qing dynasty offerings were still preserved at the committee site. In May, a Chen officer from the Construction Department came to the committee to design the preservation of the broken steles and remnants of the Dai Temple, and submitted a register. Another Zhang committee member came to the committee to inspect the offerings. Later, Kong Qingwei, the head of the Construction Department, and the provincial committees came to the committee to continue inspecting the porcelain, mostly five offerings, eight realities, and eight auspicious oil pots, lids, and clean water bowls, followed by vases, flower corners, flower sprinklers, and incense boxes. Among the silks and satins, embroidered banners and pearl banners were the most common, and there were only two pieces of double butterfly color and four happiness color. The bamboo products included incense slips and pen holders, while the metal products included copper furnaces, copper inkstones, copper pens, copper pen holders, silver bottles, and silver wheels. The wooden products included lions, wooden wheels, and large and small nanmu banners, with horse or fish dragon carvings on the base. There was also a package of fake silverware and several ingots of fake gold, a small yellow robe of more than a foot long, and a small copper mirror of an inch long. After the inspection was completed, they were sealed and a letter was sent to the Management Committee requesting them to submit an opinion on the display to the department for verification. However, the situation changed, wars broke out, and the matter was suspended again. The Zhongshan Market, the park, and the site of the Management Committee were completely garrisoned. In addition, the siege of the city in 1930 left no wooden items in the Zhongshan Market and the park. Only the top sacrificial utensils were preserved. In 1931, the 15th Route Army was transferred to Henan, and the provincial government allocated funds to restore the scenic spots and historical sites of the Dai Temple. The Zhongshan Market Management Committee displayed the preserved objects, such as iron vats, bronze statues, iron furnaces, and five offerings, in the Song Dynasty Tianzhu Hall of the Dai Temple, and planned to gradually place and display the broken steles, remnants, and Qing dynasty offerings. Recently, the provincial government ordered the Civil Affairs and Education Departments to jointly review and transport them to the province for display. The people of Taian believe that Mount Tai and the Dai Temple are not only related to history and culture, but also to the livelihood of the people. They specially submitted a petition to the provincial government, earnestly requesting that the offerings of Mount Tai and the Dai Temple be kept in Taian for display in order to prosper Taian. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>To publicly present the situation and earnestly request your gracious consideration, to comply with the wishes, and allow them to be kept in Taian for display to conform to history and for research purposes. We humbly report that according to the news, the Provincial Government held a meeting on September 11 and ordered the Civil Affairs and Education Departments to jointly transport the antiques preserved by the Taian Zhongshan Market Management Committee to Jinan for display. After carefully analyzing the wording, it is specifically for people to browse, observe the progress of culture, and provide historical research. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, and we deeply admire it. Since we have been waiting to be transported to Jinan for display, how dare we rashly offend the sacred presence? However, this item of antiques has considerable research value for the history of Mount Tai and the Dai Temple, and it has a great relationship with the people's livelihood in Taian, so we have to sincerely report it to our Chairman. Mount Tai is the most respected of the Five Mountains, towering and majestic, and has been the place where emperors have offered sacrifices since ancient times, as recorded in classics. The Dai Temple is the lower temple of Mount Tai and has always been known as an ancient temple in Shandong. Among them, the Han cypress and Tang locust trees have thick trunks, and the murals in the Junji Hall have lifelike eyebrows, which come from the Song Dynasty and have been praised by various countries. As for Mount Tai, all the items needed for the Fengchan ceremony, such as jade slips and golden books, are buried in the soil, and the location has long been lost, and there is no fixed time to discover them. The only things that can be used for reference are the remnants of Qin stones, the cliff inscriptions of Tang Dynasty, the murals of the Song Dynasty, and the Han cypress, Qin pine, and Tang locust trees. Previously, there were no antiques to speak of. Since the Qing Dynasty, every year on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month, it was the time to close the mountain. The Qing government prepared sacrificial utensils in advance, such as jade tablets (commonly called Wenliang Jade), five offerings, eight auspicious objects, and so on. There are many names, mostly copper, porcelain, silk, and the like. There are no extremely valuable items such as bronze tripods from the Qin and Han dynasties. They are only sacrificial utensils specially for offering to Mount Tai, all made during the heyday of the Qing Dynasty. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were only large and small Tibetan incense silver bottles and silver wheels, and no other sacrificial objects. Following the custom, they were escorted from the capital to the province and presented by the provincial and administrative officials, and the top officials personally presided over the sacrifice, called Fengshan. At this time, all the sacrificial objects offered before were checked, counted, and displayed in the Yuhua Daoyuan of the Dai Temple, both for the inspection of guests and for the reference of tourists. Except for this period, the Wenliang Jade was displayed for a long time, and the rest were collected in the Royal Treasury of the Dai Temple, and the abbot of the Dai Temple was ordered to manage them, and a register was submitted every two years, so that since the Qing Dynasty, no sacrificial objects had ever been lost. Therefore, these antiques came from Mount Tai, and the prosperity or decline of the country and the rise and fall of culture can be seen from the quantity and quality of the sacrificial utensils of the past dynasties, which is what should be studied in history. Mount Tai is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with five rivers converging. The fields are mostly sandy, and the people lack storage. The poverty of the people is known to everyone. As the saying goes, those who live by the mountains burn firewood, and those who live by the river drink water. The common people have no livelihood other than herding and logging. The entire area is famous for Mount Tai, and travelers from all over the world come and go constantly. In addition to the local elders and people, every year from the first month to the fourth month of the lunar calendar, no less than tens of thousands of people travel to Taian. The strong people carry burdens for a living, and the weak people run small businesses, all making a living. Inns and businesses of all sizes can make a good profit. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although the antiques have been stored in the warehouse, a public meeting was held at that time and it was agreed that the library would take turns displaying them in the exhibition hall for research (Wu Yuanlu was the curator at that time, and the library was located in the current Management Committee). At that time, there were more tourists in Taian than at any other time, and the livelihood of the people of Taian was also better than in the past. We were planning to raise funds to expand the facilities when the war suddenly broke out and we had no time to do so. In 1928, the revolution was completed and the May 3rd Incident occurred. The provincial government moved to Taian to work, and Chairman Sun changed the Dai Temple into Zhongshan Market, and the antiques were temporarily stored in the committee. Originally, the Qing Dynasty sacrificial utensils came from Mount Tai, and it was planned to build a place in the Dai Temple to display them. Before the matter could be completed, Chairman Chen took over and sent various departments to inspect and seal them. At that time, Kong, the head of the Construction Department, had a plan to build a display in the Back Cypress Courtyard or Back Chamber of the Dai Temple. We were ordered to submit an opinion for review. However, due to the circumstances at the time, it was suspended. This is the origin of the storage of antiques in the Management Committee. Fortunately, our Chairman has governed Shandong for three years and cares for the people. He has repeatedly allocated huge sums of money to repair the scenic spots and historical sites of Mount Tai. In recent years, the number of tourists to Taian has been increasing every day. Therefore, the people of Taian have proposed whether to submit a request to the Chairman to allocate funds to build an antique exhibition hall and raise funds by all means, or to request funds from the local public funds. We were just about to proceed when we saw the previous news. Because the matter concerns the relocation of antiques and is related to history and people's livelihood, we have no choice but to present the situation. We ask you to review it, comply with the wishes, and allow them to be kept in Taian for display in order to conform to history and for research, so that the people can be content and have no regrets.</p>
<p>A Record of Inspection in Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces, by Special Correspondent Ren An</p>
<h3>Aftermath Lotus Miscellany (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Lotus Special Dispatch: Since the loss of Lotus in the 17th year of the Republic, the land has been distributed multiple times, the standard still being the original number of mu per person for land allocation, implemented by lot drawing. There has been no destruction of the soil or boundary disputes, making future rectification easier. According to materials provided by Li, the county magistrate, and Ouyang, the secretary of the Lotus County Government, a brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>Before the recovery of Lotus, all the land in the county had been distributed, regardless of gender or age, with each person receiving about one mu of medium-grade land (the land varied in fertility, with some receiving as much as two and a half mu). Each mu yielded about six shi of early and late rice. However, those whom the Red Bandits identified as local tyrants, landlords, counter-revolutionaries, dissenters, and monks and nuns were not allowed to receive land, and all their land was confiscated. The bandits and their families received preferential treatment in the land allocation, better than that of poor farmers and tenant farmers. After the distribution, although the general poor farmers and tenant farmers benefited temporarily, they were soon burdened with frequent corvée labor, leading to resentment.</p>
<p>Rural finance was extremely depleted. Counterfeit Central Bank notes and public debt certificates were issued and forcibly used and purchased by farmers to absorb cash. Rural transactions were managed by counterfeit rural cooperatives. The political organization included a counterfeit County Soviet Government, as well as district and township equivalents. Villages had representatives. The internal organization of the counterfeit county and district governments was roughly divided into departments for chairman, secretary, internal affairs, suppression of counter-revolutionaries (or the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department), land, grain, culture, military affairs, finance, and transportation. The organization of the counterfeit township government, in addition to the chairman and secretary, also included poor peasant fields, stretcher teams, comfort teams, and laundry teams. Each counterfeit district and township had a Lenin Primary School, which was responsible for education and overseen by the Cultural Department. The land rights in the recovered bandit areas were handled according to the "Rural Land Handling Regulations" promulgated by the former Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, with the organization of a Rural Restoration Committee responsible for the handling. The method was to first carry out land registration, thoroughly investigate and confirm, and restore the original land rights. Before the investigation, the current state of distribution was temporarily maintained, that is, whoever was given the land by the Red Bandits to cultivate would continue to cultivate it this year. However, the original owners could collect rent according to the 25% rent reduction system (i.e., if a certain field originally owed ten shi of rent, now it would be reduced by 25% to seven and a half shi). The various facilities after the recovery included building blockhouses, constructing roads, organizing baojia (household registration system), and selecting farmers aged 16 to 45 to form Anti-Communist Volunteer Teams, providing their own equipment for self-defense. The organization of the Volunteer Teams had its headquarters in the county government, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the commander-in-chief; branches were set up in each district, with the district head concurrently serving as the branch commander; joint team headquarters were set up in the joint bao offices, with the joint bao director concurrently serving as the joint team commander; squad leaders were set up in each bao, with the bao chief concurrently serving as the squad leader. In addition, the establishment of Farmers' Banks in Feng and branches was submitted to facilitate farmers' borrowing and lending. Orders were issued to all villages to open rural primary schools with the original school funds to educate farmers' children. The land registration method required that any owner who wanted to confirm their ownership, or whose original deeds were destroyed by the bandits, could invite guarantors to fill out an ownership application form, guarantee form, and property report form to the Rural Restoration Committee of the township. After verification, it would be reported to the County Rural Restoration Committee for approval. A registration fee of 5/1000 of the land price was charged at the time of registration. When issuing the property certificate, a certificate fee was charged: 40 cents for land under one mu, 10 cents for land between one and five mu, 20 cents for land between five and ten mu, 50 cents for land over ten mu, and one yuan for land over fifty mu. The registrant should report the land price. If there were any abuses of reporting more or less, the county would organize a price committee to estimate the value based on the fertility of the land and its location. In the future, if the social situation changes and the land value rises or falls, the agricultural committee or cooperative would regularly inspect and increase, decrease, or purchase to prevent abuses. All township public land, bandit land, and land without owners would be managed by the County Agricultural Committee. It was heard that the grain registers used before the 17th year of the Republic were all destroyed and could not be verified. This land cleanup would determine the location and allocate it for actual use, and taxes would be levied according to the land price, gradually achieving the goal of equal land rights and land ownership for the tillers. However, this matter was of great importance, and it was still in the early stages of implementation. Generally, farmers were still suspicious and misunderstood, due to the precedent of land registration by the Communist Party and its subsequent collectivization. They were afraid to register as much as possible. Land registration in the recovered bandit areas of Anfu County was also rarely carried out, but they had a very heavy tax burden (collecting about 40 yuan per mu), which was slightly different from this. The Salt and Kerosene Public Monopoly Bureau sold an average of eight shi of salt per day (100 jin per shi). In addition to the two shi needed by military and political organs, the rest were purchased by the people. Estimating that each person needed three qian per day, it was known that there were only more than 20,000 people in the recovered bandit areas, accounting for about a quarter of the county's population. The recovered areas, except for the transportation routes between Chaling and Lotus, and the area within about five li on both sides, and the area within fifteen li in each direction of Lotus City, were relatively safe because of the presence of troops and blockhouses. The rest were still unstable and were being suppressed. At the beginning of each land recovery, refugees returned in droves, and many had conflicts with those who surrendered or were granted amnesty, leading to revenge killings. Moreover, the Volunteer Teams, who held guns, were prone to illegal behavior. The Administrative Commissioner's Office and the County Government paid close attention to this matter and tried various methods to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>The Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Tenth District of Jiangxi Province was located in Lotus City. When the reporter visited, Commissioner Li happened to be in Ninggang on official business. The Chief Secretary Zou Dawen received him cordially and explained the situation in detail. In addition to the above-mentioned points, which were roughly the same in meaning, he also described the post-recovery work plan for the two counties of Yongxin and Lotus, as follows: (1) Work Objectives: Based on the expectations of the higher-level government, the demands of the people, and the actual situation and needs of the recovered areas, it was decided to fundamentally overthrow the existence of the Red Bandits' power in the two counties for the past six years by simultaneously mobilizing military, political, and economic forces, and to completely eliminate the elements of local cyclical revenge, so that the people who survived the disaster could move from temporary peace to self-defense, self-governance, and self-sufficiency, establish a long-term foundation for recuperation, and achieve a harmonious and happy society. (2) Work Steps: In terms of military affairs, the first step was to assign the National Army to attack, search and suppress bandits, guard, and defend important cities, and to reorganize the original local forces to assist them. The second step was to use the reorganized local forces to maintain the normal security of the three counties, assisted by the civilian armed forces formed by conscription. The third step was to gradually abolish the equipment-style local forces and completely maintain normal security with the civilian armed forces formed by conscription. In terms of politics, the first step was to focus on pacifying people, resolving and eliminating civil disputes. The second step was to focus on recuperation, helping and organizing the people, and establishing a foundation for self-defense, self-governance, and self-sufficiency. The third step was to focus on realizing autonomy. In all facilities, the government only played a guiding role, and self-defense, self-sufficiency, universal education, and so on, were all fully realized. In terms of economics, the first step was to strive to save waste and make the greatest use of resources. The second step was to systematize economic organization based on the principle of cooperativism, concentrate all manpower and financial resources, forcibly develop production, and establish a foundation for self-sufficiency. The third step was to use government power to use the surplus resources of the people's lives, to carry out undertakings that individuals could not produce, and to complete all public construction needed by the public.</p>

<h3>After the Strike of Rice Merchants in Guangdong, Ships Carrying Foreign Rice Evading Taxes Are Detained 丨 Hunan and Anhui Rice Will Enter Guangdong Via Different Routes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After Guangdong Province imposed taxes on foreign rice, although the rice merchants strongly opposed it, and the Department of Finance repeatedly reduced the tax rate and postponed the tax collection, they were all unsuccessful. The Department of Finance still insisted on collecting taxes from September 16, but the tax payment could be extended to October 2. Therefore, the official and commercial parties have reached extremes. The rice merchants have successively stopped handling goods, and the Department of Finance has also taken strict measures against the rice merchants. Yesterday, a large team of special agents from the Department of Finance and a warship were dispatched, led by the Agricultural Products Special Tax Bureau, to Fangcun Huatai River (where rice boats are berthed) to seal up and detain foreign rice ships that had not been declared and taxed, and escort them back to the Xihao River to await instructions from the Department of Finance. As the rice merchants have unanimously stopped transporting goods, a merchant Zou, who is close to the officialdom, has gone to Hunan to negotiate the transportation of rice to Guangdong to meet the needs. It is said that a method has been agreed upon: (1) The Hunan Provincial Government and the Changsha banking industry will jointly establish a grain and rice marketing agency, jointly operated by the government and merchants, to transport rice to Guangdong for sale. (2) At least four to five million yuan will be prepared for the rice transportation revolving fund. In addition to the Hunan Southern Bank, run by the Hunan Provincial Government, allocating 1.5 million yuan as a fund, the Changsha banking industry will be asked to invest the remaining amount. (3) In addition to the Hunan Provincial Government exempting inspection fees for rice transported to Guangdong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanbei Shipping Company will be asked to reduce freight rates to lower costs and facilitate sales. It is also said that Hunan rice will begin to be transported to Guangdong in a few days.</p>
<p>As the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong has been successfully negotiated, Anhui Province has also recently started movements to promote the sale of Wuhu rice to Guangdong. Based on this, the Department of Finance has also ordered merchants here to contact Anhui merchants to transport rice to Guangdong for regulation. The department ordered the grain merchants to say: "[The Anhui Construction Department has sent a quick mail telegram stating that this province has always been a rice-producing area, and in the past years, it has sold three to four million shi to your province. In recent years, sales have suddenly stagnated, probably due to the dumping of foreign rice from Siam and Annam. This year, our province has a bumper harvest, and rice prices have fallen. Recently, the market price is about five yuan per shi, which is better in quality and cheaper than foreign rice, and is well known to both the Guang and Chao gangs in your province. We intend to ask your department to telegraph the recent rice market situation and ask to enact laws to allow merchants to contact our province, cooperate fully, and resist the dumping of foreign rice. The livelihood of the people and the national economy depend on this. We sincerely offer this suggestion and await your clear instructions.]" In addition to replying by telegram, the association is ordered to immediately comply, contact Anhui rice merchants, cooperate fully, and resist the dumping of foreign rice.

<h3>Songjiang: Mysterious Theft Case in Front of the Police Station</h3>
<p>Yongxin Wood Shop on Puzhao Temple Street is located diagonally across from the County Public Security Bureau. Duomu Jiasheng, who lives upstairs, works in the capital. His wife went to Beijing the day before yesterday, and the bedroom was locked. However, yesterday evening, pedestrians on the opposite bank suddenly saw someone wandering on the roof, shouting for neighbors to catch the thief. For a time, pedestrians gathered, and the police officers of the Public Security Bureau also went up to the roof to investigate. The electric lights shone brightly, but no trace was found. The bedroom window of Duomu had been opened, and the locks of the wardrobe bolt and four boxes had been broken. It was unknown if anything had been stolen, as the owner had gone to Beijing and there was no way to verify. After several hours of chaos, the case could not be solved. The crowd generally said that the thief had supernatural skills and came and went like a ghost. However, the police guarded all night, but there was no progress. It was suspected that the carpenter was suspicious, so he was arrested and investigated. Ma Jinru, a plasterer, was not seen when the thief was caught last night. He had inquired about the Duomu family situation a few days ago, which made him even more suspicious. After an interrogation, he confessed to the theft. He had been hiding in a dark place on the roof last night, so he was not caught on the spot. It was spread that the truth of the mysterious theft case was revealed. Also, Wang Tieshan, a dismissed tax police instructor, dressed in military uniform, sneaked into the principal's office of the County Normal School at 1 p.m. today to steal watches and silver dollars. He was discovered by the principal, who locked the door and called the police to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Theft of Seawall Timber Piles</h3>
<p>The seawall in this county was washed away by the last typhoon, and most of the stone slope and timber piles at the foot of the first section of the seawall were washed away. Fortunately, the typhoon was heading north and did not cause a major disaster. However, since the timber piles were broken, some greedy villagers disregarded the danger to the seawall and dared to steal them. According to the investigation, many timber piles had been stolen. After patrolman Li Yihua learned that the thief was Chen Atang, who had stolen the timber piles more than once, he arrested him and sent him to the prosecutor's office for investigation on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Military Officer Takes Revenge by Kidnapping a Civilian</h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 12th, the Wuxian Public Security Bureau received a telegram reporting that a pedestrian in Zhongshi Town had been suddenly taken away by two men in military uniform, who had also shot and wounded someone. Director Shen Gao immediately ordered the Third Branch Bureau to dispatch two flying squads, one to ambush at the port and one to wait at Hengtang. At noon, they saw two soldiers escorting a man in civilian clothes into the city by boat. The man in civilian clothes got off the boat and was wounded by a gunshot. They were immediately taken to the bureau. The man in military uniform confessed that his name was Meng Yuannian, 25 years old, from Zhuji, Zhejiang, and he was currently the commander of the Signals Company of the 7th Independent Artillery Regiment. His father, Meng Fengsheng, was shot and killed with a musket by Meng Yungui, Meng Damao, and Dai Ajian ten years ago. After being arrested, they escaped from prison. At that time, he was still young. Recently, he learned that Meng Yungui was hiding in Hengtang, Suzhou. Therefore, he took leave from the military camp in Peiping on October 6 and returned south, first to his hometown with his uncle Yin You to search for him. Today, he found him in Mu Du through identification by his uncle Yin You. So he stepped forward to arrest him. Meng Yungui tried to escape, so he shot him to stop him. One of the men in military uniform was his orderly Zhou Jinhua, whom he brought from Peiping. The testimonies of Meng Yin You and Zhou Jinhua were the same. However, Meng Yungui claimed his name was Meng Zihai, from Zhuji. He denied that he had killed Meng Fengsheng and escaped from prison twenty years ago. He was sentenced to be sent to the local court for investigation and verification.</p>

It read, "I am from Hangzhou, my name is Wan Jieshi, and I am 37 years old this year. I had an old illness, and I came here for a leisurely tour. Suddenly, my old illness flared up, and I vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, which made me faint." The handwriting was extremely upright and did not seem to have been written after falling down.

<h3>Completion of Xijing Road Project</h3>
<p>The Xijing Road, built by the sixth and seventh districts, starts from Tangtou and ends at Zhangjing Bridge, with a length of about twenty-four li and a road surface width of one zhang. The earthwork was completed earlier by the two district chiefs during the requisition of labor, but vehicles could not travel on it, so travelers still felt deeply inconvenienced. Later, the county government initiated the paving of coal cinder over the entire road, the construction of eight bridges, and more than two hundred large and small culverts. Since construction began in mid-August, the project has been interrupted from time to time due to bad weather, and it has been delayed until now without being completed. It is now learned that the road project has been actively supervised and workers are working hard to build it, and it is generally nearing completion. It is expected that it may be completed around the 13th or 14th. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu and Chief Technician Zhang Fulin are preparing to inspect the road so that it can be opened to traffic as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Agencies Transport Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county held its 48th committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Wei Zhiwen resolved the following matters: 1. Regarding the letter from Xintong Xieji Transportation Company requesting the issuance of a selection of detained goods, the company should be instructed to submit a letter from the shipper to the association, so that it can be identified jointly on a regular basis, and the Chamber of Commerce should be informed by letter. 2. Regarding the letter from the County Chamber of Commerce forwarding the request from the Shanghai Municipal Government to prohibit interference with the Lun Chang fabrics of British merchants, the association is based on a Japanese newspaper report from Shanghai, which stated that Lun Chang fabrics were enemy goods. Since it is claimed that Lun Chang belongs to British goods, the company should first correct the report with the newspaper before further investigation. 3. The cargo ships of various shipping agencies in this county often transport Japanese goods. If this continues, there will be no end to the suppression of Japanese goods. In the future, if Japanese goods are transported again, once discovered, the ship will be detained and severely punished.</p>

<h3>City Government's Reply to the City Council Regarding the Statement on the Use of Reconstruction Bonds for the Disaster Area</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government replied to the City Council yesterday, saying: "Greetings, we have received your letter No. 94 regarding the allocation of funds from the reconstruction bonds for the disaster area in this city. We are responding with a separate reply based on the facts: (1) The reconstruction of this city should have an overall plan. From the beginning of the issuance of reconstruction bonds by the City Government, it was recognized that in carrying out reconstruction work, both the root cause and the symptoms should be addressed, and both appearance and substance should be emphasized. It is not only to restore the old appearance of the disaster area. The allocation of funds from the bonds is based on the resolution of the 330th meeting of the Political Conference of the Central Executive Committee, [Using Funds to Reconstruct Shanghai], and the loan agreement negotiated with the Lazard Brothers, which was approved. Article 2 of the agreement states, [These bonds are designated for the modification, reorganization, and reconstruction of Shanghai's municipal administration.] Item 3 of the same article specifies several tens of thousands of dollars for the repair of seawalls in Pudong, and item 9 specifies several tens of thousands of dollars for the repair of bridges, roads, and the construction of ditches in the southern city. It can be seen that the use of funds does not have to be limited to areas directly affected by the disaster. The original opinion claimed misuse, which was probably due to a lack of clear understanding of the facts. (2) The number of public buildings specified in the bond agreement for the construction of public houses in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong originally included the office buildings of various bureaus of the City Government. Other public buildings in Zhabei, Wusong, and other places, such as schools, should also be planned and completed in order. The City Government's buildings in the central area had previously been subject to a construction contract with merchants. Since the January 28th Incident, tax revenues have decreased sharply, and there is no way to raise these funds. However, since the contract has already been signed, stopping halfway would not only damage the City Government's reputation but also jeopardize previous investments, which would be equivalent to wasting them. It would also have an impact on the Greater Shanghai Plan and the people's faith. Therefore, a special fund was designated when issuing reconstruction bonds and a contract was signed in the hope of completing the previous work. This was also a last resort. As for the 500,000 yuan allocated under the previous municipal bonds for the construction of the city center, it was a compensation fund for the acquisition of civilian land in the city center. There is still land price that has been collected but not claimed, which is all drawn from the previous 500,000 yuan and is not used for the construction of the City Government's buildings. As for the construction costs of roads and ditches in the city center, as the audit opinion stated, it is borne by the land price fees. This city has never used reconstruction bonds. The original opinion was based on a misunderstanding. (3) The new buildings of the City Government are indeed relatively solid and beautiful. However, at the beginning of the design, it was carefully considered. As a result, it was believed that at a time when people's livelihoods are declining, although it is not appropriate to add to the glory, it is also not appropriate to be too simple. There are two reasons for this: (1) This city is the largest commercial port in our country, and the City Government is the highest administrative organ. (2) It is to strengthen the general public's belief in the construction of the city center. At the same time, the office buildings of various bureaus should be as simple as possible, which is enough to prove that this government does not advocate extravagance. (4) The January 28th Incident had a major impact on any business in this city. The construction of the city center naturally cannot escape this exception. The City Government bears the heavy responsibility of the city's administration, and after the disaster of war, it believes that the reconstruction of the entire urban area must have an overall plan, and that the development of the city area, which has been in operation for several years, is the most important thing. Therefore, as soon as the war stopped, the construction of the city center was immediately started, so that the reconstruction project could be advanced at the same time, so as to achieve the effect of thorough improvement. Building new houses for the City Government is the beginning of developing the city center, and it is also the beginning of implementing the Greater Shanghai Plan. Because, before various plans are put into practice, it is feared that citizens' speculation in the area will be hesitant, so it is urgently planned to complete the building to set an example and provide an example. This is very different from the nature of building ordinary government offices, and it cannot be regarded as a matter of good service. (5) The original opinion stated that the funds for relocating the owners of small businesses in the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong to rebuild destroyed houses were used to add capital to the Municipal Bank to run a trust business. The original intention of this city to run a trust business was to prepare for the need for small business owners in the disaster area after the war to borrow money to build buildings. Because the small business owners' borrowing and construction are mostly scattered and small, if the government directly lends out the existing money, it will feel a lot of trouble. Therefore, the establishment of the Xingye Trust Company to handle its affairs is more professional than entrusting the Municipal Bank to handle it. It has now opened on the 2nd of this month. This plan will be realized in the shortest possible time. (6) The work of repairing roads, ditches, and bridges in the disaster area also includes annual repairs, which is true. However, since this city has experienced war, its finances have been difficult, and the expenses of various bureaus have been greatly reduced. It has not been able to restore its pre-war state. All repairs cannot be compared with normal times. The City Government representative should have explained it at the City Council at the request of the City Council. The time was April 22 of this year, which was the beginning of the work, so there was not much to report. Since then, all projects, except for Zhabei District, have been able to start construction in accordance with the original plan. As of now, the road and ditch projects in the Wusong District, totaling 2.4 kilometers, and the road surface of 2.8 kilometers, have all been completed. In Jiangwan District, 3.8 kilometers of road surface have been completed for more than five-sixths, and 2.3 kilometers of ditches have all been completed. The Fangxie Road ditch project in the Shanghai District is 1.4 kilometers and has been fully completed. The road surface is delayed due to the French tram company's reconstruction of the track foundation, and only one-fifteenth has been completed. The road surface of Waimalu Road has been raised by 1.3 kilometers and has been completed by eight-tenths. The Xinwurangjin project has been fully completed. In Pudong District, the second embankment road has been fully completed, and the Chunshan Street road and ditch project is being prepared. Under the trunk road, the Pudong Road road surface project is 1.56 kilometers and has been completed for nine-tenths. The Jun Gong Road road surface is 12.0 kilometers and has been fully completed. As for Zhabei District, which has suffered the most, all road and ditch projects (except Jiaotong Road) have already been planned. The City Government's responsibilities lie in doing its best within its capabilities to comfort all parties. In short, the City Government has not been negligent in the implementation of reconstruction work in the disaster area. Although it cannot achieve rapid success due to the limitations of financial resources, it strives to manage it diligently and dares not neglect its responsibilities. For the reasons mentioned above, we hereby reply to you. Please check. Sincerely, Shanghai Provisional City Council."</p>
<h3>The Silk Market in Europe and the United States Crashes, and Silk Factories in this City are Shutting Down One After Another</h3>
<p>Each dan is only worth 700 yuan, resulting in huge losses. The reason is that silk stocks in Europe and the United States are overstocked and unsalable. Silk factories have been greatly affected by the decline in sales in Europe and the United States and the decline in the domestic silk industry. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Ministry of Industry have repeatedly tried to provide relief by issuing public bonds, encouraging exports, and organizing the sale of old silk to foreign countries. In June of this year, sales in Europe and the United States suddenly stopped, and the price of silk of grade B increased from more than 700 yuan per dan to more than 900 yuan. Silk factories started work one after another. Unexpectedly, from August, silk prices in Europe and the United States fell sharply, and sales decreased. Now the silk prices have returned to the level of May. As a result, silk factories are losing too much money on the silk they have produced and cannot maintain production, so they are shutting down one after another. The number of silk factories in this city that have shut down has increased to as many as eighteen. In order to maintain the status quo, the factories that are still open have, after discussions among the industry association, decided to reduce the wages of workers that were increased in July. According to Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the reason for the decrease in the output of Chinese silk is that there is too much silk in stock in Europe and the United States. For example, in September, there were 75,000 dan of silk in stock in Europe and the United States, while only 35,000 dan were sold in September. The total number of bales of Chinese silk, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang white filature silk, Tsatlee silk, white soil silk, Jiangsu and Zhejiang yellow filature silk, yellow silk, yellow soil silk, gray silk, and doupion silk, exported this week was 1,060.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Collection of Land Value Tax; Land Bureau Plans to Send the Draft Land Tax List to the Valuation Committee for Discussion</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since this city decided to collect land value tax, the Land and Finance Bureaus have been actively preparing. According to the person in charge of the Land Bureau, the latest progress is as follows:</p>
<p>Draft Land Tax List Completed After the establishment of the Provisional Land Value Tax Valuation Committee in this city, in order to understand public sentiment, those familiar with the land situation in this city have been specially hired as members. Although the committee has held several meetings, the discussions have been limited to internal regulations, and the land price list has not yet been submitted for discussion. However, the draft land tax list has been drafted by the Land Bureau. The Land Bureau's land price valuation is based on the following standards: (1) Based on the owner's quoted price; (2) Based on recent purchase information; (3) On-site investigation. The draft list can be submitted to the Provisional Land Value Tax Valuation Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>Great Reduction in Transfer Tax After this city decided to collect provisional land value tax, it immediately stopped collecting the original land tax (non-commercial areas still collect it as usual) and also reduced the transfer tax as much as possible. According to the original transfer tax, it was 80 per mille, but now it has been reduced to 20 per mille. However, the land value tax is slightly higher than the field tax, but the collection of land value tax is based on a percentage, which is also very fair, and the reduction of the transfer tax has reduced the burden on landowners a lot. On the contrary, the government's income has been considerably affected by the reduction of the transfer tax. Since the land value tax is based on a percentage, the land value tax collected on some land may be less than the original field tax. Therefore, the City Government's move is to do its best to promote the project under the principle of fairness.</p>
<h3>The 5th National Products Movement Week; Opening Day of the Industry Exhibition</h3>
<p>The industry exhibition of the 5th National Products Movement Week, organized by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, was not open on National Day because the personnel of the organizers had to participate in the National Products Motorcade Parade and the opening ceremony at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Until the morning of the 11th, the three exhibition halls in the Confucian Temple Park were still tightly closed.</p>
<p>No one. At about 1 PM, the organizers of the industry exhibition began to arrive and officially opened. Here are the details:</p>
<h3>General Display</h3>

Behind the electric torch archway and in front of the Dacheng Gate, two couplets were hung high. One of them said, "When the country is in distress, advise compatriots not to buy foreign goods. When the people's spirit is behind, may everyone block the leaks." The other couplet was a mourning couplet presented by the Native Cloth Movement Conference, written in seal script. The upper part reads "Eternal mourning to the Foreign Cloth Master" and the lower part reads "Presented by the Native Cloth Conference." The upper couplet says, "You foreign goods, a major cause of national weakness for two hundred years, sucking blood and extracting ointment is deeply hateful." The lower couplet says, "Only our native cloth, the lives of tens of millions of people are entrusted to it, red faces and white hair all welcome it."</p>

<h3>Chen Zongdai Reports on the Activities of the Righteous Army in Eastern Jilin</h3>
<p>Wang Ziyao Proves That the Matters Stated Are Reliable. Wang Ziyao, the Chief of the Adjutant's Office of General Li Du of the Jilin Self-Defense Army,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Yesterday sent a letter to Chu Hui, the Standing Director of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, saying, "Elder Hui, I have received your esteemed letter. Now, Mr. Yang, representing our army's acting commander-in-chief Chen Zongdai, is coming to Shanghai via Hulin in eastern Jilin to request assistance, and has reliable supporting documents. The matters stated are reliable. In addition to forwarding the report with this letter, I respectfully request your public effort to preside over this matter and find a way to provide assistance, so as to save the last line of life for our righteous army. This is my earnest hope." "Attached is Chen Zongdai's report" to report on the war situation of the Jilin Self-Defense Army and request assistance with guns and ammunition to continue resisting Japan. Please review and approve this matter. I have learned that the officers and soldiers of the Self-Defense Army have been fighting for more than a year since the start of the resistance against Japan. Although they are running out of ammunition and have no support, they still persevere with fortitude and their spirit is unwavering. When General Commander Li was forced to retreat into Russian territory, more than 20,000 of the remaining troops were stationed in various locations, all under the command of Chen Zongdai, courtesy name Dongshan, who was the commander of the Third Brigade and concurrently the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route, to take charge of the rear defense and act as the acting Commander-in-Chief in order to command the various units and resist for a long time, and recover the lost territory. However, there is a shortage of both ammunition and supplies. Therefore, a representative has been sent to the country at the risk of his life, requesting assistance and supplies. The latest war situation at the front is listed as follows:</p>
<p>The counties of He, Suiyuan, and Baoqing began to be attacked by the enemy from all sides on August 20. The enemy advanced from land, sea, and air. More than 2,000 Japanese troops, and two brigades including the puppet army's Guo detachment, launched a large-scale offensive from Mishan. Yin, the naval commander of the rebel army, and more than 100 Japanese soldiers, commanded seven gunboats and advanced from the Songhua River via the Ussuri River to the counties of Hurao, etc., and launched a fierce attack. Chen's troops engaged the enemy at Heizuzi and resisted with all their might, resulting in a fierce battle. Bullets rained down, and the officers and soldiers defended against guns and cannons with their flesh and blood, fighting bravely. After a fierce battle of two nights, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs. Our soldiers still rushed forward desperately, capturing two enemy flat-firing cannons. The puppet Tao regimental commander was killed in battle, and many soldiers died. Later, due to a lack of ammunition and difficulties in supply, they were extremely hungry and abandoned the area. They attacked Baoqing and recovered the county on August 27. Yu, the leader of the rebel army, was terrified and retreated. The situation in Fujin and Chuanshan shook as a result. Zhang Zhichao, the brigade commander of our martial arts unit, was killed by the enemy. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than a dozen casualties, and our army captured more than 500 sets of cotton military uniforms and other items. (3) Zhang Xihou, the rear guard of the Self-Defense Army, led more than 2,000 soldiers and advanced from Suidong, Jiang Province, to Tongjiang. On August 26, they captured the county. Pang Zuofan, the puppet army commander, was captured by our side. The enemy was outnumbered and did not take a defensive position. They escorted the rebel Pang and retreated. After guerrilla warfare in Fuyuan and Raohe, the puppet navy, army and air force, because the mountains and forests of Hurao were dense and the terrain was dangerous, did not dare to pursue. However, the Shanlun boat in front of Gao Wang Mountain, and our Beizhen boat, were towed back to Harbin by gunboats. Now the counties such as Tongjiang are still occupied by Commander Zhang. (3) Gao Yushan is now occupying Hulin. (4) On September 11, Imada, the Japanese commander in Fujin, led hundreds of soldiers, along with a large number of puppet troops, and Qi Yaobin, the puppet county magistrate of Baoqing, led more than 200 police officers, and jointly counterattacked our Chen's troops. The Lin regimental commander ambushed the enemy at Qixinghe (more than ten miles from Baoqing County), and engaged the enemy. After two hours of battle, the enemy was repelled. There were no casualties on either side. At 8:00 a.m. on the 12th, the enemy attacked again, and the artillery fire was extremely intense. Our army deployed its forces and firmly defended its position, waiting for the enemy to approach so that they could return fire. Because there was no source of ammunition, they remained calm and did not fire a single bullet. Suddenly, it was reported that the enemy was spotted at Qixingpao (25 miles from Qixinghe). Our army, fearing encirclement by the enemy, launched a frontal attack, killing one Japanese officer and three soldiers, and one Lin Ziyang, the chief of the puppet inspection office. Many soldiers were injured. Our army retreated to the county to discuss plans due to insufficient ammunition. (5) Chen Dongshan, because the people of Boli County secretly sent representatives to welcome the army, and considering that the merchants and residents of Baoqing could be spared from the disaster of artillery fire, retreated to the territories of Boli and Mishan counties in separate ways to reorganize the various units in order to launch a major offensive. (6) Japan is now conducting Korean immigration, and the real estate in Boli County belongs to them, only giving an eviction fee of five yuan. Therefore, the people are unbearable and participate in activities with the self-defense army. (7) The righteous army Sun Chaoyang occupied Baoxian last month, and then attacked Fangzheng. The Japanese were terrified upon hearing this. Recently, they occupied Yanshou and are now active. (8) There are Wang Delin's troops moving along the Jitun line, and Fu Dianchen and Mao Song's two regiments along the Jihai line, which are very active in the Qingshi Weidian area. Furthermore, Ren, the puppet army regimental commander stationed in Weidian County, has now defected, so the Japanese army is too busy to take care of everything and is running around. If there is material assistance, it will not be difficult to recover the lost land. Moreover, it is now late autumn and will soon be severe winter, and the only concern is the clothing problem, which cannot be solved. Our army is in extreme danger, and therefore sincerely requests your association to carefully observe the perseverance and hard work of the officers and soldiers at the front, who are determined to save the country at the cost of their lives, and their deep suffering. Please approve the receipt of ammunition or funds, which can achieve the purpose of resisting Japan and provide funds to recover the territory. In addition to reporting all situations, I am submitting this document to your association for review and approval. Respectfully presented by Yang Qingshan, representative of Chen Zongdai, acting commander-in-chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, on behalf of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association.</p>
<h3>Various Bureaus Dispatch Personnel to Receive Representatives of Various Groups to Go to Beijing for a Visit. The Second Iron Exhibition Is Held in Beijing.</h3>
<p>The Second Joint National Railway Line Product Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Railways, will be held in Beijing on Double Tenth Day. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration specially invited various groups and industries in this city to visit, and prepared special trains for transportation. It is heard that the special train departed for Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. This time, there are about a hundred representatives from various groups and reporters from newspapers and news agencies. The Central Railway Bureau specially dispatched Cao Shengzhi, the section chief of the administrative affairs section, and Li Yushu, a staff member, to take care of the group. The special train is expected to leave Beijing and return to Shanghai at 12:00 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>The Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau Will Be Established Next Month.</h3>
<p>Eight Hundred Line Switching Machine Has Been Shipped from Nanjing to Shanghai. An Additional Cable Across the River Has Been Laid Near Gaochang Temple.</p>
<p>The Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, which is planned to be established, is scheduled to be formally established next month. The 800-line switching machine for Pudong's use has been sent to the Ministry of Transportation last week and shipped to Shanghai. An additional cable across the river has been laid near Gaochang Temple. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Branch Will Be Established. The address of the Pudong Branch is on Dongchang Road, with two buildings. They were built by the China Automatic Telephone Company. According to the agreement, they are all transferred to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for management. Due to years of disrepair, there is some damage. The bureau has hired workers to repair it. It is scheduled to be formally established in November.</p>
<p>The Switching Machine Has Been Shipped to Shanghai. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau transferred 300 automatic machines for use in the city center area. The Pudong telephone bureau sent personnel to the Ministry of Transportation to request 800 line switching machines. The machines were loaded onto trains and shipped to Shanghai last week. Due to slight damage to the internal parts, the engineering section is ordering workers to repair and calibrate the components.</p>
<p>Laying Cables Across the River. The Shanghai Telephone Company installed out-of-boundary telephone machines in Pudong. The river crossing cables were set up at the bottom of the Huangpu River on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The river crossing cable was taken back by the telephone bureau at a low price. The bureau is planning to develop Pudong transportation and is laying another main cable across the river near Gaochang Temple.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Transportation Plans to Add New Lines for Beijing-Shanghai Telephone Service.</h3>
<p>Business Development Needs Are Increasingly Busy. Completion of Calls Is Limited to Four Months.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Ministry of Transportation Long-Distance Telephone Bureau has gradually developed its business. Although the original lines have been expanded repeatedly, they are still in short supply. Therefore, a new line is planned to be added recently, and it will be laid along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. It is now actively underway and is scheduled to be completed within four months. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Business Development</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone service was launched in the ninth year of the Republic of China. After the National Revolutionary Army established Nanjing and established the capital, it was taken over by the Ministry of Transportation for rectification, and the equipment gradually improved. In the Beijing-Shanghai area, due to political and commercial relations, the need for long-distance telephones has become increasingly busy. Although the original telephone lines have been expanded repeatedly, they are still in short supply. Some people who register have to wait for several hours before they can make a call. The needs of the situation are still becoming more urgent.</p>
<h3>Adding New Lines</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Long-Distance Telephone Bureau is aware that the development of its business requires the expansion of the central road of the line. However, the original wooden poles and lines are fully loaded, and it is necessary to open up a new line. Therefore, it was decided to open a new trunk line along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway to meet the needs of the situation. The line starts from Nanjing, passes through Jurong, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, and ends in Shanghai. The total length is 232 miles. It is estimated that 7,673 poles need to be erected, and four pairs of No. 10 steel wires need to be laid.</p>
<h3>Completion in Four Months</h3>
<p>The bureau has prepared all the materials for this new line project and has already started actively. It is scheduled to be completed within four months. However, the laying of this line is four pairs of No. 10 steel wires, so in addition to ordinary crossovers, phantom crossovers are also installed so that it can be used for six telephone round-trip lines after completion.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian's Letter Informs of the Tragic Situation in the Communist Areas. The Situation Is Shocking and Beyond Imagination. The Residents of Shanghai Are Truly Said to Be in Paradise.</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has transferred party affairs personnel from various places to work in the Communist areas in order to reorganize party affairs in the Communist areas. Wu Kaixian, the standing committee member of the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, was also summoned to Jiangxi to assist in the management because he had been in charge of party affairs in Shanghai for many years. Wu recently sent a letter to a certain gentleman in Shanghai, describing the recent situation in the Communist areas. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Communist Areas Is Shocking.</h3>
<p>After leaving Shanghai for Jiangxi, Wu first worked at the Nanchang Headquarters of the General Headquarters to discuss plans for reorganizing party affairs in the Communist areas. At the beginning of this month, he was ordered to depart, first to Linchuan for inspection, and then to Yihuang and Chongcheng. The tragic situation of that place after being ravaged by the Red Bandits is shocking. The suffering of the people's lives is beyond the imagination of the people of Shanghai. Moreover, the climate there is abnormal. Although it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is extremely hot and there are thunderstorms, just like the midsummer in Shanghai. The bankruptcy of the rural areas and the depression of commerce are hundreds of times worse than in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Relieving the Communist Areas Cannot Be Delayed.</h3>
<p>Although the Communist areas have been gradually recovered by the advance of the armies, the people are displaced and the fields are barren. If relief is not provided immediately, it will not be enough to say "save the people from fire and water." Although the government is secretly planning and implementing relief measures step by step, if we can belong to the interior and see these dying people, we can know that the people who live in Shanghai are truly enjoying happiness in paradise. They are all people of the same country, but their living conditions are so different. Therefore, we should be more frugal and self-reliant in the future. Moreover, since we are fellow compatriots, we should be sympathetic to each other and use our spare strength to save these people. If people's lives can be stabilized, it will be more difficult for the Red Bandits to succeed.</p>
<h3>Encourage Comrades to Work Diligently for the Country.</h3>
<p>Wu also mentioned that those who work in the Communist areas, from Chairman Chiang to the soldiers, have all endured hardships and worked hard. Their unified slogan is "Saving the country and saving the people, in these few years; losing the country and ruining the family, also in these few years." At this time, it is a critical moment for the life and death of the country and the nation. Therefore, Wu asked a certain gentleman to tell his comrades and friends in Shanghai to be more diligent in working for the country and to work together to reverse this dangerous situation. Otherwise, human desires will run rampant, and the heavens and people will be angered. The destruction of the country and the extinction of the race will be imminent.</p>
<h3>The Engineering Committee of the Engineering and Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Is Established. Ten Chinese and Western Committee Members Hold Regular Meetings. The Disaster Relief Group Prints Relief Tickets as Vouchers for Distributing Food.</h3>
<p>The engineering offices of the Lu, Yu, and Ji areas, established by the Engineering and Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, have begun work on blocking breaches and repairing dikes. Now, in order to speed up the design work to be efficient and complete, the group has organized an engineering committee and has appointed ten Chinese and Western experts as committee members. The Chinese committee members are Shen Baixian, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department; Zhang Hanying, the Secretary-General of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission; Chen Zhanen, the Section Chief of the Ministry of Interior; and Chen Maojie, the member of the Capital Construction Committee. The Western committee members are Pudley, Stowe, Berang, Todde, Chatley, and Uegen. The association has scheduled to be formally established in Beijing on the 16th of this month. The first meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. to discuss the engineering design along the river. Zhou Xiangxian, the Director of the Engineering and Relief Group, has also gone to Beijing to prepare to attend and participate. The purchasing staff sent by the supply and transportation section of the Disaster Relief Group has also set off to establish a supply and transportation office. The group is rushing to print relief tickets to be distributed to the victims as vouchers for food distribution. The first batch of 20,000 sets of cotton clothing will be completed on the 15th and will be shipped to Shandong and Henan provinces first.</p>
<h3>The entire Water Conservancy Office of the National Economic Council Will Move to Beijing Tonight.</h3>
<p>The Engineering Office of the former National Government Flood Relief Commission, after being transferred to the National Economic Council, was renamed the Water Conservancy Office and is scheduled to move to Beijing entirely tonight (the 13th). Its books, stationery, and archives were sent to Nanjing last night (the 12th) by dispatched staff members on an overnight express train. The Director, Xi Dejiong, and the Section Chief, Zhu Yong, are scheduled to go to Beijing by train tonight with several engineers and staff members to formally establish the reorganized Water Conservancy Office.</p>
<h3>Tang Zongguo Reports on the Recent Situation of the Yellow River Disaster in Hebei. The Relief Association Dispatches Personnel to Purchase Relief Grain.</h3>
<p>The National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee's disaster relief news yesterday, excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Disaster Situation (1) According to the report of Tang Zongguo, the Director of the Hebei Province Relief Office, the disaster victims in the counties of Changyuan, Changming, Puyang, etc. in Hebei Province are still trapped in the water because the breaches have not been blocked, and they have no clothes, food, or shelter. In addition to dispatching Tang Yaosan, Guo Songmao, Fang Kaiqi, etc. to investigate separately, it is hoped that the breaches will be blocked and the flow will be cut off as soon as possible. (2) According to the report of Yang Zigong, the Director of the Henan Relief Office, personnel have been dispatched to investigate the disaster areas in Kaocheng, Huaxian, and Wenxian.</p>
<p>Relief Clothing The 100,000 sets of cotton clothing ordered by the Disaster Relief Group of the association, the first batch of 20,000 sets, will be delivered within days. The association plans to (1) ship the first batch to Hebei first. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the relief office, stating that it is more convenient to ship to Lanfeng first and then transfer to Daokou, because shipping directly to Dongming is blocked by traffic and there are many twists and turns. (2) The second batch will be shipped to Henan. (3) The third batch will be shipped to the Shandong Province Relief Office for distribution by the two directors, Du Shaopeng and Yin Cheng.</p>
<p>Relief Grain The supply and transportation section of the Disaster Relief Group has learned that except for the areas affected by the floods, the grain prices are particularly cheap in all the other counties of Shandong, where there is a bumper harvest of grain. Chen Weixin has been sent to the abundant harvest areas of Shandong to purchase large quantities of grain for distribution in the disaster areas of Lu, Yu, and Ji, and for the needs of setting up porridge kitchens.</p>
<p>Flags The association has printed 500,000 relief tickets and 180,000 emergency relief tickets, which have all been stamped. Together with the flags, seals, passports, and other items required for the investigation and release, they will be shipped together within days and distributed to the three provincial investigation and release offices for collection and use.</p>
<h3>Shandong Relief Group Reports on the Disaster Situation.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief received a telegram from the Shandong Relief Officer Li Changlong yesterday, stating that the Chairman and all the gentlemen's appreciation of the song telegram is gratefully acknowledged. The disaster situation in Heze has been reported in the telegram. The most seriously affected areas, where there are no homes to return to and relief is essential for survival, actually have 21,775 households, with a population of 114,547 people. Seeing the disaster victims, crying from hunger and cold, the situation is extremely pitiful. Respectfully request a huge amount of relief funds to be raised and allocated to save the survivors. The Shandong Relief Officer Li Changlong of the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Association, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arichi Is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai for Qingdao and Then to Beiping.</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arichi Akira, entered Beijing before the Double Tenth Festival to participate in China's National Day and the National Games. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The ambassador is now scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 16th of this month, accompanied by his Chinese secretary Aruo, on the Japanese ship Qingdao Maru or on the 19th on the Fengtian Maru, to go to Qingdao, and then to Beiping via Tianjin. He will stay in Qingdao and Tianjin for a while. After arriving in Beiping, he will stay for about a month before returning to Shanghai. According to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, Arichi's last trip to Beijing was definitely not for diplomatic tasks. He only participated in the National Day celebration and visited the National Games as usual.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Funeral Home Selects Personnel to Investigate in the Philippines.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Funeral Home, founded by Yan Fuqing and others, has been in preparation for a long time and will soon start construction. It will build a new-style building at the corner of Route des Soeurs in the French Concession and Xujiahui Road as the site of the funeral home. The internal equipment strives for improvement. It is recently heard that the funeral home has invited Zhang Yuquan, the manager of the Shanghai Cemetery, to go to the Philippines with a specialist doctor to investigate funeral matters, so as to provide a mirror. The journey is imminent, and it is expected that there will be quality contributions in the future.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, the chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, had previously suffered from eye loss and went to Lushan to recuperate. He has now recovered and returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi yesterday. According to the New Words News Agency reporter, the rumor that I will go to the disaster area for inspection is because the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee handles the disaster area affairs very thoroughly, and this committee has also sent personnel to the disaster area to provide relief, so I do not intend to inspect again.</p>

<h3>Widening of the Labor Strike at the Electricity Company; Central Government Orders Prompt Mediation; Representatives Sent to Shanghai for Provisional Discussions; Chinese Employees Continuously Joining the Strike</h3>
<p>According to Dakung Agency, the labor strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company is becoming increasingly serious due to the company's lack of sincerity in resolving the issue. Yesterday, over a hundred more Chinese staff members joined the strike. The central government has telegraphed the local party and government authorities, ordering them to promptly mediate. Details are as follows: ▲ Chinese Staff Members Continuously Strike Over four hundred Chinese staff members of the Electric Power Company, in order to assist the striking workers and show solidarity, resolved in a general meeting the day before to organize a slowdown committee and implement a slowdown. However, some senior staff members are still going to work at the company. Yesterday, over a hundred more Chinese staff members withdrew from the company and joined the strike, gradually moving towards unified action. The situation is becoming more serious.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Central People's Movement Committee Since the outbreak of the electricity strike, the Shanghai General Labor Union, considering the seriousness of the situation, telegraphed the central government, requesting the dispatch of representatives to Shanghai to work with the party and government organs to find a way to handle it and prevent the expansion of the disturbance. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received, (details omitted) regarding the electricity strike in the city, the party and government authorities have been telegraphed to promptly mediate. The request to send representatives to Shanghai is temporarily deferred. Signed, The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee.</p>
<p>▲ Filing with the Party and Government for Record The slowdown committee of the Electric Power Company Staff Welfare Association yesterday filed a report with the party and government organs for record, stating: Submission for Record: The workers of the new and old factories of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to their inability to withstand the oppression of imperialist capitalism, have been implementing a slowdown for over ten days. The entire Welfare Association, as part of the same company, in order to express support, held a general meeting on the 11th of this month at the Youth Practical Lecture Hall. The (honorable) Municipal Party Department sent Comrade You Heng to attend and provide guidance. A unanimous resolution was reached to implement a slowdown, and Wu Zubei, Fang Qian, and others, nine people in total, were elected as slowdown committee members. The meeting's proceedings are submitted for your convenience. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Electric Power Company Staff Welfare Association.</p>
<p>▲ Letters from Various Trade Associations Over a hundred trade associations in the city, including those dealing in north and south goods, yesterday jointly sent a letter to the Public Works Department regarding the Electric Power Company, requesting a strict order for the company to accept the legitimate handling of the Chinese government. The original letter stated: (omitted above) The labor dispute at the Electric Power Company has been ongoing for nearly a month, and the disturbance is only expanding, without any sign of stopping. We seek the truth, and it is caused by the high-handedness of the company. Electricity concerns public utilities and the interests of merchants are greatly affected. If a resolution is delayed, it could incite other incidents, causing unease among citizens and damage to commerce.</p>
<p>As the highest organ representing the citizens of the concession, you have the power to direct the Electric Power Company. You should carefully weigh the importance and strictly order the company to accept the legitimate handling of the Chinese government in order to resolve the dispute and avoid incidents. We offer this sincere advice, hoping you will consider it carefully. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai North-South Goods Exchange Association, Sugar Industry, Flying Flower Industry, Local Goods Industry, Bamboo Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, and over twenty other trade associations.</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Zhejiang Fellow-Provincials Association The Zhejiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Electric Power Company yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that we have received a report from our members in the Public Concession district, stating that the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the employer's failure to fulfill the treatment conditions, and ineffective negotiations, have been incited to implement a slowdown, hoping for the employer's awareness. Fortunately, the power generation workers are still able to abide by the union's orders, maintaining power generation and taking care of social stability. However, recently, the light of the electric lamps has been sometimes bright and sometimes dim, already abnormal. Although it may not lead to immediate extinction, this situation is dangerous. Furthermore, the labor dispute in the company is becoming increasingly fierce, and a dangerous situation is inevitable. At that time, social unrest will be difficult to predict, and our members' business operations will suffer significant losses. Therefore, we specially request you to forward this letter to both labor and management of the company, urging them to sincerely negotiate and seek a resolution as soon as possible within the possible range. If either party takes a tough stance, they should be responsible for the future losses. In addition to sending separate letters to the Shanghai Four Districts Water and Electricity Industry Union, this special letter is sent, hoping you will consider it. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Electric Power Company by the Zhejiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fulun Double Palace Silk Factory Petitions for an Order to Workers to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Workers at the Fulun Double Palace Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road have not expressed their reasons since the strike began, and they firmly refuse to resume work. Yesterday, the workers even demanded that the employer dismiss the supervisor, Mr. Shen, saying his management was too strict. The employer, considering their reasons inadequate, did not grant their request. The factory petitioned the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department to promptly order the workers to resume work and punish the strikers. The original petition stated: Submission for Petition to Stop Unreasonable Worker Strike: The factory's female workers suddenly went on strike on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. They did not make any demands beforehand, nor did they say anything afterwards, which is deeply surprising. We immediately notified the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union of the workers' strike. After the union sent representatives to investigate, they agreed to immediately order the workers to resume work. However, the reason for the strike was only known after two days, which turned out to be due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, it was decided to start work on the 11th of this month. When the time came, the whistle blew for work to begin, but the workers stood outside the factory and refused to enter, clearly being incited by others, resulting in the failure to resume work and significant losses to the factory. However, we believe that the good workers are being obstructed and unable to resume work, which is truly pitiful. At that time, representatives from the union came to the factory and said that the reason why the workers did not resume work was that they were dissatisfied with the workshop supervisor, but there was no sufficient reason. If they were dissatisfied with the supervisor, they could report to the accounting room at any time, and should not use a strike as a threat, causing unnecessary losses to both labor and management. Therefore, we specially submit this to request your bureau to strictly order the union to notify the workers to resume work immediately, and to punish those who instigated the strike, which would be a matter of justice.</p>
<h3>Sula Oil Reclassified as Third Class for Tolls</h3>
<p>The Two Roads Administration recently received Instruction No. 6754 from the Ministry of Railways, stating: According to the report from the Beining Road Administration, in July of last year, due to the request of the Asia Petroleum Company to transport internal combustion engine oil (Fueloil), which was not specified in the goods classification table, the Ministry instructed in Order No. 729 that internal combustion engine oil should be treated the same as diesel and charged according to the third class. While this was being implemented, the company sent a letter stating that the goods had been classified as third class, and requested a refund of the overcharged freight. This was approved. It was also discovered in their letter the term Sola Oil. It was asked if this was the same as internal combustion engine oil. The company replied that Sola Oil is a type of internal combustion engine oil. Since Sola Oil is a type of internal combustion engine oil, and this oil has been ordered by the Ministry to be charged as third class like diesel, then Sola Oil should also be charged as third class. However, upon checking the nineteenth page of the amended classification table, there is an item for Sula Oil, which matches the sound of Sola. Since no English was attached, it was not certain if it was the same. If it is the same, should Sula Oil be changed to third class in accordance with the Ministry's previous order? Your approval is requested. Upon receiving this, the bureau was immediately ordered to investigate the nature and price of internal combustion engine oil and Sola Oil and whether there was any difference. The reply stated that the specific gravity of Sola Oil is 0.89, the flash point is 85 degrees, and the price is 4.4 cents per pound. The specific gravity of internal combustion engine oil is 0.94, the flash point is 84 degrees, and the price is 4.9 cents per pound. The road transports internal combustion engine oil and charges it as third class like diesel. Since Sola Oil is a type of internal combustion engine oil, and the specific gravity, flash point, and price are similar, the freight should be the same. The first-class toll for Sula Oil on page nineteen of the amended classification table should be changed to third class. In addition to instructions and divisions, the bureau is hereby notified. This order has been followed by the bureau, as stated by the Transportation Department.</p>
<h3>Zhabei District Farmers' Association Holds a Dinner Gathering for Farmers from Various Villages</h3>
<p>The Zhabei District Farmers' Association of this city, in view of the fact that the farmers of Zhabei were displaced after the January 28th Shanghai War, fortunately, through the efforts of the disaster victims of various villages, and with the help of Mr. Wang Binyan, negotiated with the municipal government to build houses and borrow money, and with the construction of a poor people's village by the local association, they have been able to barely sustain themselves through a year of hard work and ambition. Now, on the occasion of the National Day holiday, although in hardship, they intend to gather together to relieve their accumulated depression. Therefore, at 2 PM this afternoon, a dinner gathering for farmers from various villages was held at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on Baoshan Road. Over 300 farmers and representatives from various groups attended, including the director of the Charity Group, Wang Binyan, representatives from the Sixth District Party Department, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, the Chuanbao Businessmen's Association, the Local Goods Trade Association, and the Dahua Farm. Chairman Feng Yixian reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Secretary Zhang Fuxiang reporting on the improvement of summer vacation and the closing of the clinic in various villages. Afterwards, Secretary-General Shen Wenbin reported that the clinic has been open for three months, and over 2,000 people have been treated, providing medicine and treatment to maintain services. This achievement is due to the proper treatment by the doctors, and thanked Chinese and Western doctors such as Mr. Lu Yuxiang for their enthusiastic volunteer work and benefiting the people. Therefore, eight silver shields were prepared and awarded to the doctors. Next, Wang Binyan gave a speech, and Zheng Po of Dahua Farm explained the advantages and disadvantages of new and old farming methods, and explained in detail methods for eliminating vegetable pests and protecting fruits, which are of great benefit to agricultural production. Finally, awards were given and the dinner began, ending at 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Many Roads in the Public Concession Will Change House Numbers; Implementation in April Next Year</h3>

<h3>China Business Company Newly Sets Water Fee Sharing Method for Tenants; Landlords Only Bear Five Percent; Yesterday Notified Various Blocks</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng Agency, since the Shanghai British Water Company calculated water fees according to the water meter, water prices have greatly increased, and major disputes have occurred between the company, landlords, and tenants. The company even used water pipe disconnection as a threat. After mediation by various parties, the situation eased. Previously, the Chinese landlords printed forms through the Real Estate Association and distributed them to the landlords, who then gave them to the tenants to fill in their daily water usage in the forms and compile statistics to negotiate with the water company in good faith so that poor residents would not suffer too much loss. As for the foreign firms, over a dozen real estate companies, including China Business Company and Five Harmony Foreign Firm, jointly sent a letter to the water company, requesting to collect fees directly from users, following the example of the electricity company. Because they did not obtain the consent of the water company, it was not realized. China Business Company paid the water fees included in the rent on a monthly basis, which was far from enough and a significant loss, unable to bear the burden. Therefore, yesterday, it notified the tenants in each block that the company would only bear five percent of the monthly water fees, and the remaining amount would still be shared by the tenants. The notification is copied below: Since the Shanghai Water Company has been charging water fees according to the water meter, the monthly water fees in this block have increased sharply. All tenants should save water on weekdays and pay attention to whether the faucets and water pipes are leaking. If any damage is found, it should be reported to the block manager immediately for repair. It must be known that wasting tap water is the loss of the tenants themselves, because the landlord only bears five percent of the water fee, and the extra amount will still be collected from the tenants by our company. China Business Company.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Telegraphed Commander Li to Preserve Shouliang Temple in Ganzhou</h3>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association, in order to preserve Shouliang Temple in Ganzhou, telegraphed Commander Li yesterday, requesting him to instruct his subordinates to find another route: Ganzhou Commander Li Junjian: Maintaining religion, you have always been enthusiastic. Regarding the preservation of Shouliang Temple, we are deeply grateful. However, the internal abandonment of Boji teachers by the temple monks, the steps were not consistent, and the road passed through the temple, causing much damage. Therefore, we specially telegraph and earnestly request you to find another route to preserve the temple, which would be a great kindness. As for the internal situation, our association will be responsible for gradually reorganizing it to meet your expectations. Respectfully submitted, the Chinese Buddhist Association.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Shanghai Branch of Wuhua Bank</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of Wuhua Trust and Savings Bank opened. The bank was originally the site of Guohua Bank. After renovation, it looked solemn and completely new, and the interior was well-equipped. General Manager Huang Huimin, along with supervisors, managers, assistant managers, secretaries, and all staff members, gathered together, gave a brief speech, and General Manager Huang personally opened the door and held the opening ceremony. Afterwards, a photo was taken at the door to commemorate the event. It is estimated that over 700 guests from all walks of life arrived on that day, including Xue Dubi, Yu Meisun, and Guo Chengen from the political circles, Chen Bing from the business community, Jiang Yiping from the legal community, Yan Hedu, Jiang Jianhou from the press, Lin Kanghou, Bei Songsun, Ji Bijiang, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Liu Huizhi, Ye Fuxiao, Qin Runqing, and Pei Yunqing from the banking community, and managers and deputy managers from various banks and shops came to congratulate.

<h3>Kangyuan Factory Goes to Shandong to Recruit and Train Workers</h3>
<p>Since the Kangyuan Can Factory in this city was changed to a limited liability company and strengthened, the first policy was to expand its business and increase its production capacity. Therefore, in the middle of last month, Wang Tonglun and Sun Tiande were specially sent to Jinan to recruit apprentices. Fifty-six people have now been recruited and are taking the Jinpu Railway south to Shanghai, where the factory will provide trucks to transport them to the factory for separate training. It is said that this move has received the support of the Shandong authorities, who have ordered the military and police along the way to protect them properly. The following is a record of the conversation with Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, the general manager of the factory, regarding the recruitment of workers in Shandong: The people of Shandong are strong, pure in thought, and particularly generous. They have been influenced by Confucianism and moral education and have a considerable foundation. The development of the three northeastern provinces was mostly done by Shandong people. Therefore, Kangyuan Factory has specially sent personnel to recruit young people, providing them with the most practical industrial training and cultivating industrial citizens who meet the needs of the times. On the one hand, it opens a new path for these good young people, and on the other hand, it cultivates the main force of industry for society. The training methods cover everything from the rules of daily life to the handling of machinery and affairs, with guidance and practice provided. At the same time, attention is paid to spiritual cultivation and physical exercise, so that they gradually become accustomed to it from compulsion, and become natural from restraint and hardship. The training period is approximately two months. During these two months, the factory will only make sacrifices for the workers and not seek production. But once the material is trained, the benefits will be unlimited. Kangyuan Factory has some experience in training workers, and this method has been tried and tested.</p>

<h3>Municipal Zoo Adds Indian Elephant, Transported to Shanghai on Wheels; Enthusiastic Registration for Hibiscus Singing Competition, Additional Aquarium and Construction of Leopard and Bear Enclosures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in this city has purchased an elephant in India, which is being transported to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month and will be displayed in a separate room. The zoo will also set up an aquarium after the animal specimen room is established. Registration for the hibiscus singing bird competition is very enthusiastic. Details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Elephant Transported to Shanghai on Wheels</h3>
<p>The zoo previously bought an elephant in Siam (Thailand), but it was returned after being transported to Hong Kong because the elephant's feet were found to be damaged. The handler went to Calcutta, India, and selected an elephant, valued at over two thousand yuan. It has been loaded onto the Jefferson and transported to Shanghai, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month. The zoo is currently preparing to build a giant animal enclosure to house it.</p>
<h3>Establishing an Aquarium</h3>
<p>Since the start of the collection of specimens for the animal specimen room, in addition to the transfer of a part of the animals from the former Practical Elementary School to the zoo, there have been many private donations. After purchasing the land west of the new building of the specimen room, construction will begin in the spring. After the animal specimen room is established, an aquarium will be set up to collect various aquatic animals.</p>
<h3>Adding Two Bear Enclosures</h3>
<p>According to the zoo's original plan, the giant animal enclosure was divided into four interconnected enclosures for lions, tigers, leopards, and bears. Later, due to insufficient funding, the leopard and bear enclosures were not built. The leopard enclosure was temporarily built with wooden sheds, and two black bears were placed in iron cages. The last time, the iron nails broke, causing the large bear to escape from the cage. In order to avoid accidents, the zoo has specially petitioned the Education Bureau to submit a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds to add two leopard and bear enclosures. As soon as the Municipal Government approves, construction will begin next month.</p>
<h3>Hibiscus Singing Bird Competition</h3>
<p>After the Education Bureau approved the regulations for the first hibiscus competition, the zoo began registration. Participants are very enthusiastic. The competition was originally scheduled to be held on November 12th (Sunday). Now, the bird owners, because the hibiscus is in the molting season, have requested a one-month postponement. After the first hibiscus singing bird competition ends, competitions for white-eyes, larks, and other birds will be held in early spring next year.</p>
<h3>West Paint Industry Association Opposes Telephone Price Increase; Absolutely Cannot Dig from Lean Flesh to Supplement Fatty Sores; No Price Increase Permitted Within Three Years of the Contract</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Paint Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Taxpaying Chinese Citizens Association in the Concession yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that recent news reports that the Shanghai Telephone Company has new news of price increases, and that the implementation method will be announced as soon as the Public Concession Public Works Department approves it. Public sentiment is panicked. Telephones are a public transportation utility for citizens. Price increase measures should carefully consider the trends in the social economy. Since the Shanghai Incident, the market has been sluggish and it has been difficult to recover. The decline of industry and commerce has reached its peak. Many businesses in the concession have gone bankrupt due to operating losses, and the number of businesses that have closed is increasing, all of which are signs of a sluggish market, which the concession authorities are aware of. Even if the telephone company has business losses, they are mostly due to poor local planning and absolutely cannot dig from lean flesh to supplement fatty sores, suddenly ordering users to bear the burden of price increases. Moreover, the contract between the company and the Public Works Department stipulates that there will be restrictions after the completion of the installation of automatic machines and after the number reported by Mr. Wang Ansen increases, and no price increase will be allowed within three years. We have always admired your association as the voice of the citizens and for protecting the public interest. We hope that you will base your protest on the third point of the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Public Works Department in 1930, which stipulates that "no price increase will be allowed within three years after the increase," legally forward a letter to the Public Works Department to protest and not approve it, and strongly advocate to protect the public utility interests of citizens. With the utmost gratitude. West Paint Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Wrongfully Accused Person in the Sino-French Laundry Company Cleared; Yao Xiaoyong Commits Suicide Due to Injustice; Russian Foreman Actually Receives His Due</h3>
<p>Yao Xiaoyong, a native of Huzhou, 20 years old, was a laundry worker in the Sino-French Laundry Company opened by French businessman Lisbonis (transliteration) at No. 7, Lane 279, Fulilu Road, French Concession. The foreman was a Russian named Boliubaike Laijiniqi (transliteration), 37 years old. Recently, thefts have occurred frequently in the workplace, with hundreds of pieces of clothing entrusted by customers, valued at two to three thousand gold, reported to the police for investigation, but the case has not been solved. The workers, because Yao was addicted to gambling and his monthly salary was often insufficient, suspected Yao of stealing. Yao learned of this and, because of the unanimous accusation, could not defend himself. In a moment of desperation, he left privately on the 4th of this month. After Yao left without saying goodbye, the workers became more suspicious of Yao's theft and searched for him everywhere, but to no avail. Then the matter was dropped. After Yao left the workplace, he suffered the injustice of being innocent and had nowhere to live outside. In addition, he had no money to use. Overwhelmed with emotion, he had a sudden thought and went to the Xiangxing Inn at No. 6, West New Bridge Street, French Concession, at 8 PM on the 5th, opened room number 15, and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. When the poison took effect and he groaned, the waiter discovered it and sent him to Renji Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. The hospital notified the police, who took the body to the morgue. The court sent someone to examine it. Because the family members did not arrive, the body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall branch for burial. Yao's suicide by poisoning was briefly noted in the newspapers. However, since the theft occurred at the Sino-French Laundry Company, the workers have been paying close attention to prevention. Until recently, the company's foreman, the Russian Boliubaike Laijiniqi, handed a bed sheet of his own to be washed in the workplace. The workers noticed that there was his name mark on the corner of the bed sheet, and there was also a surname mark of another person inside, which aroused suspicion. They reported this to the supervisor Lisbonis, who questioned the Russian about the origin of the bed sheet, but he hesitated and could not answer. So, he reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and found dozens of Western-style coats and other items entrusted by customers to the Sino-French Laundry Company in his home. At this point, the case was cleared, and it became clear that Yao Xiaoyong had committed suicide due to wrongful accusation. The detectives took the Russian and the stolen goods to the police station and sent him to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution the day before. Judge Qiu Huanying questioned him in the Eighth Criminal Court. Because the police investigation procedures were not completed, they requested an extension for further questioning. The official briefly questioned the defendant and ordered him to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bao Rongtang's Second Daughter-in-Law Sues for Division of Property Dispute; Accuses Father-in-Law and Brother-in-Law of Neglecting Support and Harsh Treatment, Requests a Lump Sum of 30,000 for Support</h3>
<p>Bao Yang, a local woman, is the daughter-in-law of Bao Rongtang. Bao had two sons, the elder named Jianfu, who now runs the Longxing Gold Shop in the Stock Exchange on Avenue Edward VII, and the younger son named Qiankui, who was the husband of Bao Yang, who died in 1917. Bao Rongtang's father was named Feng, who used to run Yingfeng Money Shop on Zhua Wa Street for over seventy years, with considerable profits and accumulated assets of hundreds of thousands, a famous money shop in Shanghai, but it is now closed. Recently, Bao Yang, because her father-in-law and brother-in-law did not provide support, entrusted lawyer Hu Jue to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment to divide the estate and provide a lump sum for support. This case was heard in the Seventh Civil Court yesterday afternoon. According to the plaintiff's statement of the reasons for the lawsuit, after her husband died in 1917, she gave birth to a posthumous daughter. Later, the daughter unfortunately died prematurely, but she still has a son, named Zhizhi, who is now nine years old. The plaintiff endured hardships, maintained her chastity, and raised her adopted son. The plaintiff's ancestors left an estate of no less than hundreds of thousands of gold, all of which was managed by the defendant's father and son. The plaintiff's living expenses were all paid by them, but they were very harsh. The plaintiff was under the oppression of her father-in-law and brother-in-law and lacked the ability to make a living on her own. She listened to her father-in-law's orders and spent her years in pain. However, since April 1st of this year, for several months now, the defendant has cut off the payment of the plaintiff's living expenses, forcing her to borrow money with no way out. That is, the property that the plaintiff inherited in the name of her late husband's uncle, Shu Wenwei, was all secretly sold without the plaintiff's consent, obtaining tens of thousands of dollars, which is legally invalid. Since the defendant obtained the ancestral estate, he opened the Longxing Gold Shop, and his wives and concubines live in luxury. Now there is still common inherited property that has not been divided, and there is a fear that it will be quickly sold off. Therefore, it is requested that the ancestral estate of Fenggong be divided and a lump sum of 30,000 yuan be paid for support. Because the defendant did not arrive yesterday, the trial could not proceed. The judge then ordered a rescheduling for this afternoon on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Gruesome Murder: Beef Shop Partner Seduced Shop Owner's Daughter, Lured and Killed – Handsome A'mao Seduced Shop Owner's Daughter, Sun Chufu Lured Him to Wharf, Murdered Him by the River at Midnight – Case Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Chufu, 37 years old, from Danyang, residing at 20 Sanminfang, Yangzhou Road, had been long widowed. He cohabited with a woman surnamed Chen from his hometown, who had a daughter from a previous marriage named Guiqing, 17 years old. She worked as a laborer at the Shenxin No. 7 Cotton Mill. Sun ran a beef shop at 352 Qiwu Pu Road, making a decent living. Sun's friend, Shuai Shuchun (also known as A'mao), 29 years old, was a lecherous gambler. He previously ran a congee shop on Yangshupu Road, but due to his extravagance and inability to make ends meet, he closed the shop last winter and made a living by gambling. He also worked as a bookmaker for the Flower Association, with no fixed residence, resulting in dire financial straits and almost all his clothes pawned. After the Dragon Boat Festival this year, Sun, seeing his poverty, took pity on him and allowed Shuai to stay in the shop to help with chores. Unexpectedly, on the 26th of last month, Sun received a very urgent letter from his hometown stating that his mother was critically ill and he should return home immediately. Sun packed his bags and left, entrusting the shop to his wife and Shuai A'mao. After Sun left, Shuai reverted to his old habits and repeatedly seduced Guiqing, leading to her being tempted and committing adultery with him three times at the Pingliang Road No. 11 Peace Hotel. This was discovered by her mother, Chen, who questioned her daughter. Guiqing admitted to being seduced. On the 6th of this month, Sun's mother's condition took a turn for the better and she was out of danger. Sun Chufu returned to Shanghai. Chen immediately told Sun about her daughter being seduced. Sun told his wife that he would deal with his friend appropriately, so he did not show his anger and treated him as usual. The night before last, after a hearty meal with the shop assistants, he invited his neighbor, Zeng Shubao, and Shuai A'mao, among others, to play mahjong together until midnight. During the day, Sun bought incense and candles, and secretly hid a kitchen knife. He tricked Shuai into going to the Qiwu Pu Road wharf under the pretext of praying to the Flower Association. They went to the wharf together. Sun first lit the incense and candles, instructing Shuai to kneel and pray first. Sun stood behind him and said that he had treated him well, but he had seduced Guiqing to the hotel while he was away. Now that it was exposed, he would kill him. Shuai knew that he had been found out and pleaded in vain. Sun then used the knife to hack at his head and arms, causing him to fall to the ground with three of his right fingers chopped off. He died instantly. Sun pushed his body into the Huangpu River, returned to the shop, hid the murder weapon under a pot in the stove room, changed his blood-stained clothes, and fled. The next morning, a person discovered bloodstains and three fingers on the ground at the wharf and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. Chief Detective Yang Peisheng was immediately dispatched to investigate. Fearing that the victim had sunk to the bottom of the water, the Water Police Station was notified. At around 10 o'clock, the body floated up thirty yards from the wharf and was quickly recovered. It was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital. The doctor confirmed that the right hand was missing three fingers, which matched the three fingers recovered by the police station. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road for examination. The police learned about the incident and detectives apprehended Sun Chufu near Sanminfang on Yangzhou Road in the middle of the night. The murder weapon was also seized and brought to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the investigation, stating that the defendant was also rumored to have an affair with Guiqing, which was why he used such cruel methods. He requested an adjournment for a detailed investigation. The murder weapon and blood-stained clothes were presented as evidence. Witnesses Hong Senhe and Zeng Jinshi testified that they played mahjong that night, but did not know anything else. When questioned, the defendant Sun Chufu admitted to tricking the deceased into going to the wharf under the pretext of praying to the Flower Association. He was then questioned about the seduction. Knowing that he had been found out, he did not beg for forgiveness, so he committed the gruesome act. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date. At 11 o'clock, the court commissioned Prosecutor Diao to come and examine the deceased Shuai A'mao and confirm that he died from being wounded by a knife. Since no family members were found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Handling Overseas Travel Procedures: Taking Money and Fleeing Without a Trace – Owner of a Cigarette Paper Shop Handles Procedures for Going to France, Takes the Money, and Avoids Meeting – Narrowly Meets in the Great World, Private Imprisonment, Police Prosecution</h3>
<p>Chen Huanhua and Cai from Wenzhou, residing at 19 Jiahe Lane, Hed Road, wanted to go to France to seek opportunities in May. They needed to obtain passports and purchase ship tickets, but had no one to handle the procedures. They consulted Ye Wenqing, a fellow townsman, who then referred them to Lin Huimao. Lin's cousin had previously gone abroad and all the procedures for obtaining a passport, etc., were handled by Wu Maojian, the owner of the Taichang Cigarette Paper Shop on Maikelike Road, Tilanqiao. Therefore, on a certain day, Lin led Ye, Chen, Cai, and others to the Taichang Cigarette Paper Shop to contact Wu Maojian several times. Wu agreed to handle the procedures for a fee of 600 yuan. Chen and Cai managed to raise 440 yuan and paid it to Lin first. The remaining fees would be paid later. However, after the money was paid, there was no news for several months. When they went to find Lin, he avoided meeting them. They went to the Taichang Cigarette Paper Shop to negotiate with Wu. Wu used a trick to settle Chen and others in the shop, secretly transferred the shop to someone else, took the money, and fled without a trace. Chen and others were driven out by the new shop owner and had to find another place to live and secretly investigate the whereabouts of Lin and Wu. On the 10th of this month, at around 11 o'clock at night, Lin Huimao was playing in the Great World with friends when he was suddenly stopped by two people who demanded the money he had swindled. This led to a big dispute. The French police arrived and took Lin and the two people to the Big Ben Police Station. Ye Wenqing had also heard the news and rushed to the French Police Station. The police chief said that the matter occurred in the Chinese area and refused to deal with it, so they were all released. However, after Ye Wenqing and the other two people left the police station, they restrained Lin again and hired a car from the Feihong Automobile Company at the intersection of Xizang and Aiduya Roads. They got into the car together and drove to Chen Chunyou's house at 21 Zhenhe Lane, Jupulais Road, in the French Concession to negotiate, but to no avail. The next morning at 5:30, they moved Lin to 19 Jiahe Lane, Hed Road, and held him captive, demanding that Lin return the money he had swindled. Lin had no choice but to write a note asking his friend Wu Zhimian for help. Wu lived in the Jinling Public Apartment on Bubai Road. After learning about the matter, he went to the Zhifeng Customs Brokerage on Minguo Road to find his friend Ma Xinmin. After discussing it, they decided to report it to the police station. They went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the matter the afternoon before. Chief Detective Tang Zhihong and Detective Cui Buyun were dispatched to 19 Hed Road and arrested Ji Wenqing and Chen Huanhua, along with Lin Huimao. They were taken to the police station and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation, saying that the police were currently prosecuting the two defendants, Ye and Chen, for violating Article 316 of the Criminal Law on obstruction of freedom and requested an investigation. After Judge Xue Lanru questioned the original and accused parties and the witnesses Ma Xinmin, Chen Chunfan, and Wu Zhimian one by one, he said that the case was quite complicated and that the defendants were already involved in civil proceedings, so he ordered the case to be adjourned to the 17th of this month for further hearing. The plaintiff Lin Huimao and the defendants Ye Wenqing and Chen Huanhua were all remanded in custody pending police investigation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee Seeks Public Opinion</h3>

<h3>Holding Spot Checks on Stamps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to various trade associations regarding the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau's spot checks on stamps. It stated: "We received Public Letter No. 103 from the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau on the 7th of this month, which stated that the implementation measures for the stamp tax stipulate both persuasion and inspection, originally aiming for widespread purchase and affixing of stamps by merchants and residents, fostering a habit of respecting national taxes to increase revenue and maintain legal benefits. Last year, we were ordered to change to strict inspections at any time to prevent concealment. The Bureau Chief only sought to promote sales and achieve quotas, but did not implement it. However, in recent months, sales have stagnated, and the amount has gradually decreased. Considering the reasons, the jurisdiction is vast, and persuasion may not be comprehensive. Among the businesses, many understand the matter and mostly comply with the affixing of stamps on documents that require them. However, there are still instances of those who try to take advantage and deliberately conceal things. Moreover, in order to avoid affixing stamps, they avoid using receipts that should be issued in business transactions or use modified slips and horizontal lists to evade taxes. Such behaviors greatly harm the future of national taxes and have been repeatedly ordered to be prohibited. The Bureau is ordered to investigate and punish, and the assessment is stricter, so we must carry out a thorough rectification. We have decided to conduct spot checks on stamps starting this month, sending personnel wearing badges to cooperate with the local police. In addition to issuing notices to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Shangbao County Government, ordering the police to assist in the handling, we are also sending notices to inform all merchants and residents to be aware that all books, bills, etc., must comply with the regulations and affix stamps accordingly. Do not conceal anything, lest you be found out and punished according to regulations. We hope that you will take note and inform your members to be aware of this and affix stamps according to the regulations early to avoid being inspected and fined."</p>
<h3>The History of Mr. Xiao Beihai, the Young Master of the Haijingbo Circus</h3>
<p>Xiao Beihai, also known as Bojun, is currently 23 years old. He is the son of Haijing Bobo, the head of the circus. Not only is he a circus expert, but he also knows everything about the circus's affairs. All the staff in the troupe praise his diligence in handling affairs, and he is extremely amiable to both people and animals. He is very interested in all the affairs of the troupe and is truly a born circus performer.</p>
<p>He was not born in a noisy, wandering environment, but in a very orderly city in Germany twenty-three years ago. At that time, although he was young, he already had a small circus, with a dog, a small horse, and a wounded lion. The interesting life of his childhood is often reminiscent of his imagination, and he never forgets it.</p>
<p>After graduating from Hamburg Middle School in Germany, he entered a business college to pursue further studies. After completing his studies, he worked in a private bank for two years. Then, he traveled to the Americas to further improve his banking and commercial knowledge. He loved the romantic life of the circus since he was a child, and when his father called him to join the circus, he was overjoyed. He will inherit all the assets of the circus in the future. What distinguishes him from other circus people is his meticulous thinking, amiable manners, and proficiency in several languages, especially English. When he performs with the three horses, he is full of heroic spirit, but at other times he is quite gentle.</p>
<h3>The Tigers in the Haijingbo Circus - The Construction of the Wusong Ferry Pier Begins</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities plans to build a municipal ferry pier in Wusong to facilitate commercial transportation. It was previously decided to build the pier at the original site of the ferry terminal on the Outer Bund, with a construction cost of 25,000 yuan. Construction was originally intended to begin soon, but there was a dispute with the owner of the beach, a French merchant, regarding the title deed. An agreement has been reached and construction officially began yesterday. In the future, the municipal ferry can travel directly from the 16th Bund in Shanghai to Wusong, facilitating the transportation of goods and greatly developing commerce.</p>
<h3>The Lawsuit Between Brothers-in-Law is Postponed - Zhao Weixian and Wei Tingrong</h3>
<p>Zhao Weixian from Henan, the commander of the Sixth Battalion of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps, and Wei Tingrong from Ningbo, the former commander of the French Concession's Volunteer Corps, are brothers-in-law. Both are sons-in-law of the late Shanghai tycoon Zhu Baosan from Dinghai. Wei is the eldest, and Zhao is the youngest. In 1928, Wei was kidnapped by bandits and rescued by Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station. The kidnappers, Lu Ruowang, Cai Weicai, Chen Zhongheng, and Zhu Jingcheng, were arrested one after another. Zhao Weixian was also suspected. Zhao happened to be on leave visiting relatives in Suzhou, and the police station sent detectives to Suzhou to arrest Zhao and escort him to the former Public Hall and the Second Special District Court. Lu and the other four were sentenced to imprisonment. Zhao, being an active military officer, was ordered by the court to be sent to the military justice organs for trial. The Police Department disagreed and appealed. The Supreme Court's third instance upheld the ruling that Zhao be transferred to the military court for handling. The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court transferred Zhao to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. After investigation, it was concluded that Zhao was not suspected of committing a crime and he was released. Zhao felt that he had been wrongfully detained for a long time and that his reputation and spirit had been damaged. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit against Wei with the Garrison Headquarters, accusing him of false accusation. Because Wei failed to appear in court several times, the trial could not be opened, and he was wanted. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Zhao Weixian has now hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Wei Tingrong of false accusation and requesting a summons for trial. The court, based on the petition, originally scheduled the hearing for 2 p.m. yesterday and issued a summons in advance, sending a police officer to deliver it to the defendant, ordering him to appear in court at the appointed time. However, after receiving the summons, the plaintiff Zhao Weixian filed a petition with the court due to some matter, requesting a postponement of the hearing. The presiding judge approved the request and sent a police officer to deliver the ruling to both parties the day before yesterday. Therefore, the case was not heard yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Many Petty Thieves in West Shanghai - Disturbing Single Guests Late at Night</h3>
<p>The Hed Road area in West Shanghai is located in a remote area, and petty thieves often enter and exit the area late at night. If they encounter single guests, they surround and rob them, and many people have been victimized. Li Mian, the former Chief Justice of the Criminal Court of the Jiangsu Higher Court and now a lawyer, resides at 651 Rendali, Hed Road. At 11 o'clock the night before last, he was returning to his residence by rickshaw when he was suddenly stopped by two bandits at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xiaoshadu Road. Li immediately showed them his name card, and the bandits did not resort to violence and turned away. However, Li's rickshaw puller, Wang Asi, secretly followed the bandits. On the way, they encountered a search team from the Jing'an Temple Police Station and told them about it. The detectives of the team arrested Qiu Weigou and Jiang Fuquan, two bandits, and confiscated a sharp knife, a fake pistol, over twenty pawn tickets, and several wallets. They were taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday. Judge Yan presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested a postponement for investigation. The court granted the request and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Alterations Discovered in a Notice of Separation from Cohabitation Lead to Litigation - Counter-Evidence in Jia Lin's Bigamy Case</h3>
<p>Wu Bin (courtesy name Chuba), a staff member of the First Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, from Anhui, married a young woman named Jia Lin (also known as Huixian) in the capital. Lin Xianjian, from Guangdong, the director of the Xianjian Hospital on Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, learned about it and claimed that Jia was his wife. He accused Wu and Jia of adultery in the First Special District Court. The various testimonies and confessions have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that when Jia Lin previously requested the court to search the Xianjian Hospital for evidence, a draft of an advertisement was found, which was drafted by Wu Bin on behalf of Jia Lin, severing her cohabitation relationship with Lin. Now, after Wu read the draft in detail, he discovered many alterations. For example, the phrase "severing the friendly cohabitation relationship" was altered by deleting the word "friendly" and adding the word "couple". Also, the phrase "did not hold a wedding ceremony" was completely erased. Wu is convinced that the alterations were made by Lin Xianjian. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Lin for fabricating evidence. The trial was held in the First Special District Court by Judge Xiao yesterday afternoon. Jia Lin was also summoned to testify, and the defendant hired lawyers Wu Peng and Hu Jue to defend him. First, the plaintiff Wu Bin stated the intent of the lawsuit. Jia Lin then testified that the draft was drafted on her behalf by Wu. Later, because both parties had identities, it was not sent to the newspaper for publication. But when I gave the draft to the defendant, there was not a single alteration. Lin Xianjian denied altering the draft. The lawyers for both parties then concluded the debate. The judge announced that the verdict would be delivered at a later date.</p>
<p>Neighbors Considered it a Rare Event</p>
<p>Xiao Yifeng, from Hubei, ran the Xiao Yifeng Pig Bristle Workshop at the intersection of Liyuan Road and Renshou Lane on South Railway Station Road, and it was quite prosperous. Therefore, he was quite wealthy. However, Xiao knew his fate and had only one daughter, who was over forty years old and had already married and had grandchildren. Xiao, being over fifty years old and still childless, always planned to take a concubine to have children, so that he could enjoy his old age and his property would not be wasted. A girl named Zhang, only fourteen years old, who was quite beautiful but had lost her parents, worked for Xiao every day. Xiao saw that the girl was petite and cute, and although there was a difference of more than three times in age, equal to a granddaughter, he did not care. He then asked a matchmaker to offer a large sum of money, about a thousand yuan, to entice the girl's guardian as a bride price, and thus completed the old-young marriage. After both parties reached an agreement, Xiao rented the building at 31 Renshou Lane and arranged a new room. Yesterday, he welcomed the fourteen-year-old bride home by car. It was truly a white-haired old man marrying a child. Because it was a rare event, everyone in the neighborhood went to watch the wedding. Some even set up platforms and benches, as if watching a play. A woman surnamed Cao was pushed and fell, injuring her waist, and has already been treated by a doctor.</p>

<p>Since the Tonghua Rainproof Weaving Factory started exporting rainproof serge fabric, it has been well-received by all walks of life because the fabric can be worn in both sunny and rainy weather and has better rainproof performance than imported rubber raincoats, resulting in increasing sales and supply falling short of demand. The factory's original building at the Penglai Road intersection was not sufficient for its needs. To expand its business, it selected a new building on the west end of the Chexin Bridge on the French Avenue and officially opened it yesterday. In order to popularize the fabric and repay the kindness of its customers, the factory is holding a large sale this week and has prepared 150 sacrifice items. Each item, originally priced at 5 yuan and 2 jiao, is now offered at a special price of only 2 yuan and 4 jiao. Samples and details are available for mail orders from other places.</p>

<h3>National Games Day 3: Men's Javelin, Triple Jump, National New Records</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) Today is the third day of the National Games. New records continue to emerge like bamboo shoots after rain.

The current total score is tied. With a score of 26 to 20, Shanghai is in the lead, but is tied in the pole vault. Shanghai's strength is weak, but Shanghai has three generals, Fu Bao, Lü Chen, and Cao Yu, who can all score points. If there are no unexpected changes, Shanghai still has hope of winning the field event championship. Therefore, the Shanghai team is still very optimistic. The 12th was for preliminary and semi-final races. The situation is the same as before. Shanghai's strength in all events is average, so there is great hope. In the past three days, the total score for women's athletics is: Shanghai 30, Guangdong 18, Henan 6, Beiping 4, Shandong 3, Hunan 3, Fujian 2.</p>

<h3>Field Event Summary: Peng Yongxin Breaks National Men's Javelin Record</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) In the men's javelin final, Peng Yongxin broke the national record. The javelin event is key for Shanghai and Beiping to win the field event championship, so the atmosphere was tense. Athletes from Shanghai and Beiping were all eager to win the final victory. During practice throws, Peng Yongxin of Beiping and Hao Chunde of Shanghai both exceeded 50 meters. Unexpectedly, during the formal competition throws, the results were worse. As a result, although Peng Yongxin broke the national record of 47.26 meters held by Mu Zuoyun with 48.92 meters, he regressed a lot compared to his practice. Hao Chunde tried his best, but he could not catch up with his practice results. He only got 46.72 meters, ranking third, which greatly affected Shanghai's field event championship. Second place was Zhao Qiming of Hebei, and fourth place was Zhang Lingjia of Beiping. There is one thing that all the athletes participating in the competition have that is imprinted in the minds of reporters, and it is worth recording, that is, some athletes have crude javelin techniques, and the distance is only a few meters, which is very far from the 40-meter measurement standard line in front. Whenever the athlete threw, there was laughter from the stands, but the athlete did not care and was full of the spirit of research and learning, and still threw each time, which made people respect him. This is also the spirit that athletes should have to promote the true purpose of the Games. Because sports cannot make any progress without going through this stage. Recalling the physical education situation in major cities 20 years ago, it was not like the inland today. The reporter dares to say that after a few years, the physical education in various places in the inland will not be difficult to catch up with the situation in today's cities. The most important thing is the degree and spirit of learning. I hope that the athletes from the provinces and cities in the inland will work harder. Discussing the throwing posture of each person, the reporter once asked Wang Fudan, the javelin judge, who said that few of the dozens of people were standard. Most of them could not use the speed of running and the power of the waist, and only relied on the flexion and extension of one arm. Therefore, the results are far behind.</p>
<h3>Ma Ji Sets New Record in Women's Discus</h3>
<p>Women's discus is a new event in the National Games, and it is not popular in all places, so the level is still in its infancy. It is not difficult for those who have a little achievement to win the championship. Ms. Ma Ji of Shanghai is Ma Zijun, a famous weight thrower in North China. She has made great progress in Shanghai recently and is known as the "Iron Bull" in the women's world. She is very confident in both the shot put and discus events, so yesterday's women's discus final won the championship, just like Liu Changchun's 100 meters, there is no problem at all.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Hopes to Break Far East Record in 200 Meters Final Today</p>
<h3>Quick Report on Men's and Women's Track and Field Preliminary and Semi-Finals</h3>
<p>Liu Changchun Sets Another Record in 200 Meters</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) In the men's 200-meter semi-final, Han Jinglin of Hebei won the first group with a score of 22.8 seconds. The score is very valuable. Unexpectedly, Su Xiaoru of Shanghai won the first place in the second group with a score of 22.7 seconds. Even more gratifying is that Liu Changchun's 22 seconds in the third group made the national record of 22.4 seconds go bankrupt again. Liu also started late in the preliminary round. He only caught up with Zhong Lianji after 50 meters, and by the finish line, he was 15 meters away from Zhong. Cheng Jinkuan, who was third, was about 2 meters behind Zhong. Liu did not seem to use his full strength to sprint when he reached the finish line. It is not difficult to improve to between 22.0 and 22.1 seconds in the final and break the Far East record of 21.8 seconds.</p>

<h3>Dong Shuzhao Breaks National Record in 800 Meters</h3>
<p>The champions of the two 800-meter preliminary groups were both won by Shanghai. The competition in the first group was the fiercest. Jia Lianren of Lu led the first 400 meters, followed closely by Zheng Sen. At 500 meters, Dong Shuzhao came from behind and surpassed Jia Lianren by about half a meter. At 600-700 meters, Jia and Dong went side by side. At the finish line, Jia was finally defeated by Dong. The result was 2 minutes and 5.2 seconds, which is equal to the new record of the Shanghai Games, breaking the national record of 2 minutes and 6.8 seconds held by Wang Minglian. The champion of the second group was Li Yanxiang of Shanghai, with a result of 2 minutes and 8.4 seconds. Li is a new rising star with a promising future.</p>
<h3>Tao Yingjie Has the Highest Hope in Intermediate Hurdles</h3>
<p>In the 400-meter intermediate hurdles race, Tao Yingjie, who holds the national record in the first group, competed with Wang Jingxi of Beiping. Tao beat Wang with his agile posture over the hurdles. Wang's posture seemed not as good as Tao's. Tao has a better chance in the final. Cheng Jinkui won the championship in the second group with his speed, with a result of 61.2 seconds, which is not as good as Tao's 59.9 seconds. Jin Huaizhi of Zhejiang won the championship in the third group with a result of 61.1 seconds. Jin should have a chance to be selected in the final. Sun Huiyin of Shanghai was about 20 meters behind Jin. The results of the intermediate hurdles semi-final were average and not very special, because the preliminary and semi-final races were connected by only three hours.</p>
<h3>Qian and Zhang Groups Are the Most Attractive in Women's 100 Meters</h3>
<p>In the women's 100-meter semi-final, two of the three groups broke the national record, no longer letting Sun Guiyun monopolize the spotlight. Zhang Jieqiong of Guangdong in the first group and Qian Xingxu in the third group both had a record of 13.5 seconds, the same record. It is expected that the competition between Zhang and Qian in the final will be unavoidable. Lan Diqing of Beiping in the second group had 13.8 seconds, which also tied the national record.</p>
<h3>Qian Xingxu Will Definitely Win the Championship in Women's Hurdles</h3>
<p>In the women's 80-meter hurdles, Wu Suyun of Sichuan with 15 seconds, Qian Xingxu of Shanghai with 14.3 seconds, and Yu Xiulan of Shandong with 15.1 seconds all set new national records, with Qian's result being the most outstanding. In the semi-final, which was divided into three groups, Qian was still able to maintain her original skills, which was very rare, only falling behind by one-tenth of a second. Her beautiful posture won thunderous applause from the audience. She will definitely win the championship in the final. Yu Xiulan of Lu was abandoned by Qian by more than five meters. Zeng Huiqiong of Shanghai in the second group and Wu Suyun of Sichuan in the third group also broke the national record with 15 seconds.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Visited Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) Chairman Lin arrived at the National Games venue at around 4:00 PM on the 12th. He got off the car in front of the track and field stadium and was led to the west gate order table by the staff of the organizing committee. As he stepped into the East and West Command Towers, the two bands played music to welcome him. Lin was very pleased to see thousands of athletes competing. When he entered the East Command Tower, Wang Shijie, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boling, and the audience and guests all stood up to pay their respects. Lin smiled and returned the salute, sitting in the center of the second row. He returned to the city at 6:00 PM. Sun Ke, Zhu Jiahua, Shi Ying, Tang Youren and his wife, Zeng Zhongming, and Zhou Qigang also came to the venue to visit.</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Committee Hosted Athletes Last Night</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The Central Propaganda Committee hosted the National Games athletes at 7:00 PM on the 11th. More than 2,000 people attended. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, and Shao Yuanchong personally gave speeches and served tea and snacks. They distributed various books and publications on party principles to each athlete and gave each person a commemorative badge. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting was uplifting, and the athletes shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang" and "Support the Chinese Kuomintang". At the end, there was a film and music performance until the meeting was adjourned at 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Men's Basketball: Shanghai Basketball Proves Its Strength, Massacring Shandong 53-31. Fujian Achieves Success with 49-29 Victory over Shanxi.</h3>
<h3>The Shanghai-Shandong Match</h3>
<p>The men's basketball game at noon on the 12th, Shanghai versus Shandong, was one of the most intense moments since the opening of the games, officiated by Ying Bangwei and Huang Kelang.</p>
<p>▲Amazing Performance Shandong's defense was excellent, making it difficult for Shanghai's forwards to perform. Shandong's Sun Hengle scored with a long shot, opening the scoring. Qian Jingyong scored a free throw, followed by another basket. Chen Xianglong committed a foul, resulting in a 3-3 tie by Fu Zhihuan. Jiang Shang scored a second time, giving Shandong a 7-3 lead.</p>
<p>▲Sudden Change in Momentum Wu Guolin replaced Chen Xianglong, and Shanghai's momentum surged. Qian Jingyong broke through the enemy lines three times, suddenly reversing the situation to a 9-7 lead. Feng Nianhua entered the game, and the forwards began to connect. Lu Zhongen made a legal long pass, and Wu Guolin successfully stole the ball, adding another two points. Feng Nianhua, Wu Guolin, and Lu Zhongen all scored against the opposition, putting Shanghai far ahead at 17-9. Subsequently, Shandong appeared confused, and Feng Nianhua played with ease. Shanghai won the first half 25-16.</p>
<p>▲Striving Hard Starting in the second half, Shandong slightly improved, gradually closing the score gap. Fu Zhihuan's throws were effective, and Jiang Gaodi also made significant contributions, reducing the deficit to just five points at 32-27. However, the good times didn't last. Shanghai's three forwards openly attacked the plank road while secretly advancing into the basket, scoring with incredible skill. Shandong panicked, struggling to defend.

<h3>Situation of the Fujian-Shanxi Battle</h3>
<p>In the second match between Shanxi and Fujian, Fujian was stronger and maintained the lead throughout.</p>
<p>▲Moving Freely</p>
<p>Fujian's forwards moved as if in an empty field, scoring at will. The score quickly rose to 2-0, 4-0, and 6-0. Shanxi called several timeouts, which had some effect. After Wei Xianwen scored a long shot, Wang Jing added two points, showing some improvement. After a long period of melee, Fujian led 22-12 at halftime.</p>
<p>▲Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>The second half became even more chaotic, with both sides engaging in hand-to-hand combat without any clear rules, relying solely on courage and resulting in numerous fouls. Towards the end, Fujian managed to connect slightly, scoring more frequently near the basket, ultimately defeating Shanxi 49-29.</p>

<h3>Women's Tennis Preliminary Round: Sichuan's Ladies Impressive, Achieving Total Victory over Jiangsu. Sichuan Forfeits to Jiangsu in Both Singles and Doubles. Hebei Eliminates Jiangxi.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) There were two women's tennis singles matches on the 12th, Sichuan vs. Jiangsu and Hebei vs. Henan, starting at 9:00 AM. Sichuan's Bao Dajing is short and stout, but her tennis skills are superb. Her shots are sharp and swift, no less than a man's. Jiangsu's Zou Huifen is no match for her. In both sets, Bao won 6-1. Hebei's Qu Shuzhen defeated Yu Fuqi. Cui Yu's strength was vastly different, resulting in a one-sided situation. Both sets ended with a score of 6-0, a triumphant victory.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) Hebei had one team in both singles and doubles. Jiangxi forfeited, Hebei forfeited in doubles. In the singles match in the morning, Hebei won, calculated as a 2-1 victory over Jiangxi, advancing to the second week of competition. Sichuan forfeited in doubles, Jiangsu won.

<h3>Batavia Eliminates Hubei, Xu Chengji Shines</h3>
<p>▲Young Overseas Chinese Tennis Player Lives Up to His Reputation</p>
<p>▲Xu and Lin Together Win Two Singles Matches for Hubei</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) In the men's tennis match on the morning of the 12th between Batavia and Hubei, Batavia's Xu Chengji, the Java singles champion, had defeated Qiu Feihai twice. His superb skills were self-evident.</p>
<p>▲Xu Chengji Displays the Aura of a Famous Player</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, he faced Hubei's Chen Fuyu. People in the capital had heard of his name, and hundreds came to watch. Hubei's Chen was a former Shanghai champion with considerable skill. However, compared to Xu, he paled in comparison. Despite his efforts to resist, he was ultimately defeated. The scores were 6-1, 6-0, and 6-1, all won by Batavia's Xu.</p>
<p>▲Lin Xuyin Fights Vigorously to Overcome the Enemy</p>
<p>Just as the Xu-Chen match ended, the match between Batavia's Lin Xuyin and Hubei's Luo Guanggui began. According to the schedule, only one singles match was to be played in the morning, with doubles and the second singles match in the afternoon. However, at Batavia's request, the second singles match was moved to the morning, with Hubei's consent. Therefore, the schedule was temporarily changed. At the start of the match, Hubei's Luo Guanggui displayed impressive momentum, seeming to dominate the court, leading 4-1. However, Lin was not weak, and since Batavia only had two representatives present, and the tournament rules stipulated that singles players could not also play in doubles, Batavia had to forfeit the doubles match to Hubei. Therefore, the outcome of this singles match was crucial to the overall result. Lin immediately caught up, winning three consecutive games to tie the score at 4-4. Luo then won his service game to take a 5-4 lead. However, Lin managed to tie the score again at 5-5. Lin then won two consecutive games to win the first set 7-5. At the start of the second set, Luo's strength waned, and he collapsed. Lin, on the other hand, was full of energy, displaying his brilliance and winning six consecutive games to win the set. In the third set, the battle resumed fiercely. Lin lost his service game, and the competition in the second game was even more intense, with seven ties before Lin finally won the game. The score then reached 2-2. Lin then won three consecutive games to lead 5-2. Finally, despite Luo's desperate efforts to win two games, he was ultimately defeated 6-4. As a result, Lin won 7-5, 6-0, and 6-4 in straight sets, and Batavia eliminated Hubei with a score of 2-1, advancing to the third week of competition.</p>
<p>▲Introduction to Xu and Lin's Tennis Skills</p>
<p>Xu Chengji's serve is exceptionally sharp and swift, no less than that of Lin Maihua. His long shots and net play are even more outstanding. His slice shots are also excellent, with very few errors. However, he needs to improve his overhead smash. He is fast and has an excellent style, making him a rare and versatile tennis player. Lin Xuyin's long shots and slice shots are no less than Xu's, and his overhead smash is particularly good. Unfortunately, his serve is weak, and he is overweight, making him less agile. This is a significant disadvantage. Hubei's Luo Guanggui is short and agile, and is very good at running. He can return balls that seem impossible to reach. His serve and long shots are also impressive. However, his overhead smash is weak, and his form and footwork could be improved. He has a promising future and should strive to improve.</p>
<h3>Beijing Wins Both Singles and Doubles, Defeating Fujian 2-0 and Advancing to the Third Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The first singles match between Beijing and Fujian started yesterday morning. Beijing's Gao Huimin is an experienced player, while his opponent's skills were mediocre, making it an easy victory. Gao won 6-2, 6-2, and 6-0 in straight sets.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The doubles match between Beijing and Fujian started at 2:00 PM on the 12th. Beijing's Li Baozhen and Liang Wenbiao both play with their left hands, but their skills were not weak, and their teamwork was excellent, with few errors. Fujian's Quan Lin and Guo Wenhua have decent skills, with solid groundstrokes, volleys, and net play. Compared to the Beijing team, there was little difference in skill level. Both sides were evenly matched, and the match was decided after five sets. In the first set, the Beijing team displayed their strength, winning with ease. At the start of the second set, Fujian tried to counterattack, but Beijing did not show any weakness. The competition was intense, with several ties. After 6-6, Fujian won two consecutive games to win the set 8-6. Encouraged by their victory in the previous set, Fujian continued to attack, winning two consecutive games, followed by each side winning a game, giving Fujian a 4-2 lead. However, Beijing then rallied, tying the score at 4-4. Not wanting to lose momentum, Fujian made another effort and won the set 6-4. The fourth set was crucial. If Beijing won, they would have a chance to decide the match in the fifth set. Beijing then concentrated and fought steadily, winning three consecutive games to take a 3-0 lead. After Fujian won a game, Beijing then won three consecutive games to win the set 6-1. At the start of the fifth set, Fujian seemed to show signs of resurgence, taking a 2-0 lead. However, their performance then declined, with frequent errors, and they lost six consecutive games. As a result, Beijing defeated Fujian 3-2. The scores of each set were as follows: Beijing won 6-0, Fujian won 8-6, Fujian won 6-4, Beijing won 6-1, and Beijing won 6-2.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The women's basketball team from Suiyuan, a remote border region, had fashionable uniforms, but their skills were lacking. In the match against Guangdong at 9:00 AM on the 12th, the disparity was obvious. They struggled to defend, let alone counterattack. Guangdong's women moved unhindered, as if in an empty field. Guo Hongzhen was especially valiant, with accurate shots. She and Lu Huilan were a perfect match. As a result, Guangdong won by a large margin of 89-5.

<h3>Soccer Semifinal: Hubei Makes the List, Winning 3-2 Against Sichuan. The Trip Can Be Considered Worthwhile.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) There were three soccer semifinals on the 12th: (1) Hubei vs. Sichuan in the morning, (2) Hebei vs. Shandong (the winner of the preliminary round) in the afternoon, and (3) Beijing vs. Suiyuan. Hubei and Sichuan were evenly matched, fighting intensely. Hubei barely managed to win 3-2. The referee was Wu Shouheng.</p>
<p>▲Sichuan's Cannonball Misfires After the start of the game, the cheering squads of both sides arrived one after another. The Sichuan team consisted mostly of 20 students, who were brave and skilled. The Hubei team was made up of players from various universities, with slightly better teamwork. Less than ten minutes into the game, a Sichuan defender accidentally misfired, sending the ball into his own net, resulting in a goal. After that, both sides alternated between attack and defense, but there were no further goals. Hubei led 1-0 at halftime.</p>
<p>▲Hubei Takes Advantage of the Situation In the second half, the Sichuan team regained momentum, constantly pressuring the Hubei side. In the 12th minute, Sichuan's left inside forward, Zhong Shijin, scored a goal, tying the score. The cheering squad applauded and stamped their feet, showing great enthusiasm. Hubei retaliated. Two minutes later, they also scored a goal. The battle then became even more intense. In the 30th minute, Sichuan's Zhong Shijin scored another goal, tying the score again. Finally, with the Sichuan team launching an all-out attack, their defense was weakened, allowing the enemy's right wing to take advantage and score a goal. Cheers erupted. In the second half, the score was 2-2, with no winner. The final score was 3-2, with Hubei defeating Sichuan.</p>
<p>▲Both Sides Cheer Each Other On The two sides frequently cheered each other on. The spectators consisted of representatives from both teams, as well as Sichuan natives in Beijing. Between defense and attack, shouts rose up, and the atmosphere was tense. In the end, the Hubei team won by one goal, triumphantly returning. After cheering, they took photos. Hubei initially had no chance of winning a title. Now that they had won once and made the list, they could be content.</p>

<p>▲The Shandong Team's Morale is Low In the second half, the Shandong team's morale was low, falling into an irrecoverable situation. Hebei scored two more goals.

<h3>Northern Expedition Team Beats Suiyuan Team by a Landslide</h3>
<p>Eight to Zero</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) In the second football match, the Northern Expedition team played against the Suiyuan team, winning by a landslide score of eight to zero. The Suiyuan team was made up of middle school students, whose training was not yet mature and whose skills were very immature. However, their spirit and courage are commendable. It is hoped that the authorities will actively promote sports. In the future, when sports develop, who knows who will win when they meet teams from Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong. The Northern Expedition team's strength is also not very strong; their connection and shooting both lack skill. It is said that this is due to the hasty formation of the team. The referee was Lu Xiangzi. The score was six to zero in the first half and two to zero in the second half, for a total of eight to zero. The Northern Expedition team won completely.</p>

<p>The men's volleyball preliminary round was held at 3:00 PM on the 12th, with two groups: (1) Nanjing vs. Henan, (2) Guangdong vs. Jiangxi. As a result, Nanjing won against Henan three to one, and Guangdong won against Jiangxi three to zero. The competition proceeded as follows: Qiu Jixiang served as the referee for the match between Nanjing and Henan. The Henan team was well-organized and came on strong. Fortunately, Nanjing's front row had He Hemin, who won with skill. However, the result was still a loss to Henan by twenty to twenty-two. In the second game, Nanjing bravely chased after the score. Henan was at a loss. As a result, it was twenty-one to ten, and the two sides tied. In the third and fourth games, Henan's back row lost coordination. After serving, it was often blocked by Nanjing's front row He Heling and hard-killed by middle row Zhao Shizuan and could not be salvaged. Nanjing then reversed the defeat with a score of three to one.</p>

Many Shanghai women's volleyball stars were in the stands, eager to test the waters. They then had a friendly practice with Beiping to measure Beiping's strength. Although the outcome was not determined by victory or defeat after the first game, the Shanghai ladies considered the Beiping team a strong enemy that would seize the championship.</p>

<h3>Baseball Preliminary Round Results: Hebei Easily Wins Against Hunan</h3>
<p>▲A Total of Seven Innings Played Resulting in Thirty-one to Zero</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 11th dispatch) At 3:00 PM on the 12th, the baseball game between Hebei and Hunan had no competition to speak of. Hunan's pitching and catching layout was slow and unbearable. Except for the seventh inning, Hunan failed to occupy second base. In the seventh inning, they took a single breath and succeeded, first occupying third base, with hopes of scoring. Unfortunately, their knowledge was insufficient, and they lost the good opportunity, ending in vain. Hebei's baseball has been promoted vigorously in the past two years, and its strength is considerable. A small test of its abilities resulted in a landslide victory over Hunan with a score of thirty-one to zero. Hebei's pitcher Guan Fushao only released four balls and struck out a total of eleven batters twice. However, in this kind of competition, it is difficult to judge his true skill. The Hunan players were fundamentally insufficient to test. However, the closed-off sports style of the Central Plains still has a baseball team organization, and its enthusiasm for promotion is commendable. Hebei's scores for each inning are as follows: First inning, six points; second inning, five points; third inning, five points; fourth inning, eleven points; fifth inning, two points; sixth inning, three points; seventh inning, not played.</p>

<h3>The Grounds Department Sends a Letter of Inquiry to a Certain Referee丨For Improperly Measuring the Length of the 100-Meter Dash丨丨Showing Disrespect for the Hard Work of the Athletes in Practice丨</h3>
<p>▲Shen Siliang and Others Mediated and the Matter Was Resolved Peacefully</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) In the afternoon of the 12th, before the women's 100-meter preliminary round, certain track and field referees suspected that the length of the 100-meter distance was 20 centimeters too short. Then, after re-measuring with a flexible mesh ruler, there was no error. The Grounds Department sent a letter of inquiry because they should not have measured the distance in public. The letter stated, "Sir, what was the purpose of personally measuring the 100-meter distance on the field? If you do not trust the Grounds Department, the track and field referees should review it before the meeting. If you trust the Grounds Department, then the act of measuring is completely unconscious. Fortunately, the measurement result showed that the 100 meters was only off by half a centimeter. If the error was indeed as much as 20 centimeters as you stated, then what would be done with the results already achieved in yesterday's men's 100-meter dash? Wouldn't it cause a major dispute? The results achieved by Mr. Liu Changchun in yesterday's 100-meter dash would be suspected of being due to the track being less than 100 meters. This disregards the hard work of the athletes in practice and the responsibility of the Grounds Department. Please provide a clear response to dispel the doubts of the public," and so on.</p>
<p>The Grounds Department of the General Assembly blamed a certain referee for re-measuring the length of the 100-meter distance. After Shen Siliang and others mediated, the Grounds Department understood, and the letter of blame was not sent, and the storm was calmed.</p>

<p>▲United China Film Company Shoots Sound Film</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) At 11:00 AM on the 12th, a shuttlecock kicking performance was held at the National Martial Arts Arena, and United China Film Company shot a sound film. First, Jin Youshen and others from the Beiping team gave a continuous performance of three people, which was lively and interesting. Finally, Chu Minyi also joined the performance. Chu was wearing short clothes and long leather boots were not removed. When kicking, his long beard fluttered. He could only continuously kick more than ten times, but his skill with the boots was already not bad. The audience applauded thunderously. At the time, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government was also present and saw Chu's spirit and enthusiasm, and also applauded to show his appreciation.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) At 12:00 AM, the track and field competition field had no programs and felt quite deserted. The National Martial Arts Arena was mostly empty, with mostly soldiers. Zhang Boling, Ma Liang, and Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government were all in the judging seats to watch, smiling and in a state of extreme joy. Mr. Chu's performance relied on his age. At 11:00 AM, the National Martial Arts Arena performed shuttlecock kicking. Finally, Mr. Chu Minyi also took off his coat and stood up, wearing long black riding boots, showing off his skills. However, his technique always felt stiff, but Mr. Chu relied on his age and often let the shuttlecock fall to the ground, not caring at all. The so-called emphasis on sports is on the spirit, not on competition.</p>
<p>The names of the shuttlecock performances are as follows: (1) The Beiping team performed single leg, double gourd, jumping horse, front bottom, back bottom exchanging dragon turn seal, three people kicking in four scenes, continuous passing, continuous passing bottom, group kicking freestyle, separate kicking freestyle.

<h3>Chairman Wang's Banquet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) Education Minister Wang Shijie hosted a banquet at Yizhou on the evening of the 12th, inviting the heads of education departments from various provinces and cities participating in the National Games, including Yang Yan, He Siyuan, and Chen Bulei, etc. They parted happily at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Strike丨Resist the Crowd Hitting the Bus</h3>
<p>▲Resumed Work Yesterday at 5:00 PM</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) There were many spectators at the National Games, and the 40 buses of the Jiangnan Automobile Company were not enough to distribute. When the meeting ended on the 11th, there were few buses and many people, and disputes arose, causing more than ten buses of the company to be damaged. The company suffered this intangible loss, and the drivers and ticket sellers were unwilling to be scolded by the audience again, and agreed to strike at 12:00 AM. After the Transport Group strongly negotiated, only ten buses were dispatched for the athletes to ride. Due to the strong efforts of the traffic police and guards, traffic was resumed at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>▲Spectators Must Maintain Order When Taking the Bus</p>
<p>▲No More Complimentary Tickets Will Be Issued</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) The Organizing Committee of the National Games issued a notice stating: (1) Since the opening of the Games, for the past two days, every time the meeting ended at 4:00 PM, the spectators attending the Games took the bus back to the city, scrambling to squeeze in or climbing in through the windows, or damaging the buses and forcing the drivers to drive. Seeing this situation, each bus company dared not continue driving because the company's capital and the lives of the drivers were at stake. If this continues, it will be unfortunate for the conference. In addition to the association notifying each public bus line to operate as usual, it is hoped that the spectators attending the conference will strictly observe order when taking the bus back to the city to facilitate traffic. (2) The various guest badges and long-term complimentary tickets produced by this association are few in number and have been given away completely. In the future, requests from various agencies, groups, and individuals will be difficult to fulfill.</p>
<h3>Awards Will Be Given at the General Assembly Venue</h3>
<p>▲The Principle Is That There Should Be No Postponement Due to Rain</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) Wang Shijie arrived at the meeting at 2:00 PM on the 11th to preside over the meeting, then took a plane around the venue for a week to inspect the situation. After getting off the plane, he went to the venue and applauded to commend the athletes when they broke the national record. At 6:00 PM, he inspected the prizes with Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the Competition Committee, and roughly agreed that the awards would be given at the National Games venue. Methods would be found to remedy the situation in case of rain, with the principle that there should be no postponement due to rain, in order to facilitate the return of the athletes.

<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Sends Representatives to Participate in the Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) The Gansu Provincial Government telegraphed Chen Qin, director of the Gansu Provincial Government's Beijing communications office, to participate in the conference on behalf of the province to support the grand event.</p>
<h3>Education Minister Arrives on the Scene to Command</h3>
<p>▲There Are Still Many Unnecessary People in the Venue</p>
<p>▲Athletes Should Rest When Not Exercising</p>
<p>This National Games was hosted and prepared by the Ministry of Education. The chaotic order of the first day was criticized by all parties. Education Minister Wang Shijie deeply regretted it. That night, he convened an emergency meeting of all groups and sections to determine corrective measures, which has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. After the meeting, the order was greatly improved. Each competition was able to proceed on time and was completed at 6:00 PM. Because Minister Wang attended the Sino-British Cultural Association, he was unable to arrive on the scene to command. Therefore, Deputy Minister of Education Duan Xipeng personally came to the scene, sat in the east command post, and guided the planning. Therefore, everything was well organized and there were no special problems. Duan returned to the city only after the competition was completed, which shows the Ministry of Education's concern for the conference. Dong Shouyi, head of basketball referees, discussed the order of the track and field field on the scene, although it was better than the first day, there were still many unnecessary personnel in the venue, so the audience could not see the field events, which was a pity. If athletes who do not participate in the competition wander around the venue, it will consume their energy and obstruct the view. The managers of each team do not interfere at all, which is very wrong. Athletes should rest fully in a suitable place before the competition, which is proper. I visited the All England Games in England in 1915 and saw that there were very few people in the field, and there was no</p>
<p>On training, deep attention should be paid.</p>
<h3>Zhang Huilan Discusses Hu Ruisheng's Failure</h3>
<p>▲Participated in Too Many Events Without Sufficient Rest</p>
<p>丨Slow Start in the 200 Meters by Two Steps丨</p>
<p>Women's physical education expert Zhang Huilan talked about the reasons for the failure of Hu Ruisheng, a short-distance runner from Beijing, in this competition: (1) Women's physical education in Beijing is not popular enough. Only a very small number of people usually practice, and only a small number of people are interested in participating in the competition. Hu Ruisheng participated in too many events and did not have sufficient rest before the competition, which was one of the reasons for the failure. (2) The method of issuing commands and the speed of starting are very related. Hu used Mr. Guan's command method, which is different from the ordinary one, causing her to be two steps slower at the 50-meter starting point, and it is a pity that she was not selected. Women's sports in Shanghai and Guangdong are popular, and talents emerge in large numbers, and the results have greatly improved. The women's championship is a competition between Shanghai and Guangdong, and Beijing cannot catch up. In the future, we should strive to promote it, so that women's sports in the central location can be on par with Shanghai and Guangdong. I sincerely hope that the educational administrative authorities and colleagues in Beijing will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>General Li Du Comforts the Northeastern Athletes丨Tears Flowed When He Talked About Old Times丨</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) General Li Du went to the National Games venue on the afternoon of the 12th to comfort the Northeastern athletes. Tears flowed when he talked about the old days, and Li wept uncontrollably. He said goodbye after about an hour. Li is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Liu Xuesong Gives a Lecture on Physical Education in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Physical Education College of the National Health Institute, which Zhang Zhijiang founded, is located on the left side of the Central Sports Field and is very large. Last night, physical education expert Liu Xuesong was specially invited to give a lecture on the review of the last World Games and the recent trends in physical education in the United States. Many athletes from various provinces who heard that Mr. Liu was giving a lecture at the school went to listen, and the crowd was gathered, which can be said to be a grand occasion. It is said that Mr. Cheng Dengke will be invited to give a lecture on German physical education tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Venues丨Military Police Like Facing a Formidable Enemy; Northerners Like the Interest; Genuine Talents and Extraordinary People Not Seen; Disappointment in Ticket Revenue</h3>
<p>▲Two Different Faces</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) The gate of the track and field field is heavily guarded, and the military police guarding the gate are carrying guns and ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy. It is not allowed to enter during the track and field competitions in the afternoon, and it is not allowed to enter even when there are no track and field competitions in the morning. However, there was a women's softball game in the track and field field on the morning of the 12th. In order to gather news, the reporter planned to enter the venue to watch. After being trapped by the gate and unable to think of a way, he went to the back of the venue, which is the entrance to the east command post. Ignoring the 721 (referring to being reckless) and rushing into the venue, he actually got through without being stopped. He was unexpectedly overjoyed, but thinking of the two different faces of the gatekeepers, he could not help but feel strange.</p>
<p>▲Strange Noises from the Audience</p>
<p>The second match of the men's basketball game between Shanghai and Shandong in the morning was very crowded. After Shandong lost to Hebei and won the reputation of a strong enemy, this time, the battle with Shanghai was highly anticipated by the audience. The team's passing was swift and skillful, but the shooting was not very accurate. Shanghai's victory was expected, but Shandong's skills also gained the favor of the audience. However, the movements were fierce and often committed fouls, and the general northern audience often shouted strange noises, attracting the attention of the whole venue.</p>
<p>▲The Gleam of Swords and Knives</p>
<p>There were the most spectators at the National Martial Arts Arena. The venue was divided into a large circle, a small circle in the center, and a small circle on each side. When the competitors entered the venue, they entered the small circles on both sides. The referee held a colored flag and stood in the center of the field. The two competitors ran to the center circle and began to fight. The chest was protected with a baseball, and the chest protection used by the receiver was to prevent injury. Victory was achieved if the opponent was knocked down or forced out of the big circle. Other judges and recorders sat next to the big circle. Knives, spears, swords, halberds, and weapons of various colors were lined up in two rows. The gleam of the knives was dazzling, awe-inspiring, and frightening. These instruments were sharp and sharp. If they were used, there would be danger. For the past two days, genuine talents and extraordinary people have not yet been seen in the boxing matches.</p>
<p>▲Few Spectators</p>
<p>From the second day of each competition, tickets must be purchased to enter the venue. However, very few local people in Nanjing went to inquire, so the business in front of the ticket booths was very sluggish. Only a small number of acquaintances from Shanghai bought tickets to enter the venue. The conference's estimated ticket revenue of 20,000 yuan will be a complete failure. Although there were many spectators, most of them were athletes and various honorary directors, staff, and school groups and armed comrades. If this conference were held in Shanghai, the ticket revenue would be considerable.</p>

<h3>A Strange Story at the National Martial Arts Arena丨Many Suicides in Fencing Competition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, December 12th dispatch) In the fencing competition, fake leather swords were used. The sword was coated with soil, and the winner was the one who could touch the opponent with the sword and leave a red mark. In the competition, there were many competitors who accidentally touched their own clothes with the red color on their own swords and failed. There was Tian Hongye, a representative from Qingdao, who actually committed suicide three times.</p>
<h3>Incessant Cursing During Combat</h3>
<p>During combat, most of the cursing was incessant when it became fierce. Someone grabbed someone's neck, and the other shouted, "Why are you grabbing me, you motherfucker!" The whole venue couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>
<h3>Yang Jieren Performs Special Skills</h3>
<p>Shuttlecock expert Yang Jieren performed his special shuttlecock kicking skills, such as arm kicking, head kicking, and foot kicking, which were all called amazing.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xiangxian Acts Like an Elementary School Student</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang visited the National Martial Arts. Zhang Jingjiang suffered from hemiplegia, sat in a soft chair, and had to be helped by two strong servants to move around. Yesterday, he stayed in the National Martial Arts Arena for a long time and left at noon. He was carried out of the crowd. Zhou Xiangxian and several female friends also came and went between the venues. They had the inexplicable pain of not understanding the martial arts competition and repeatedly asked Chu Minyi how to win or lose. He said to himself, "You are an elementary school student coming here to attend class."</p>
<h3>National Games Male and Female Athletes Should Pay Attention to Sports Medicine</h3>
<p>▲Loss of Appetite and Weight Are Deteriorating Neurasthenia</p>
<p>The general dysregulation of the nervous system is a minor symptom of the athlete's physical abnormality. After excessive training, the dysregulation of the nervous system becomes more pronounced, thus displaying a special neurological symptom that can indicate that the physical abnormality is also progressing, and can be used to judge that during excessive exercise, the nervous system and other organs are working together to perform vigorous activities. After exercise, the fatigue of the nervous system can be expressed in an extremely significant phenomenon. Professor Asidow, a famous German sports medical scientist, said, "When the nervous system is excessively fatigued, its fatigue is even greater than that of the muscles.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fatigue caused by sports that require the activity of the nervous system is particularly severe. If the nervous system is often fatigued without being given sufficient rest, it is easy to show symptoms of neurasthenia, namely, loss of appetite, insomnia, impaired memory and judgment, pseudo-dependency, loss of will, and lack of the ability to act decisively. Athletes who engage in excessive and intense practice are very likely to fall into this state. This kind of neurological fatigue does not occur by chance, but is caused over several weeks or months. It cannot be restored to its original state without long-term rest. This is also called chronic fatigue caused by exercise, which is the consumption of physical strength, loss of appetite, and gradual weight loss due to frequent insomnia. Therefore, coaches must pay attention to the cause of sudden weight loss in athletes. This kind of influence is even more pronounced in complex athletic competitions. Before a confrontation competition, the intense mental tension caused by practice makes it most likely for the nervous system to fall into excessive fatigue. If proper rest is not given and the symptoms are allowed to progress, it is easy to cause other diseases.</p>
<p>▲A Complication of Labor Belongs to the Deterioration of Physical Abnormality</p>
<p>German Doctor Ribis recently discovered a kind of "labor complication."</p>
<p>This kind of pathology is most worthy of study by our sports community. The cause of this disease is that a physically healthy person suddenly engages in intense physical exercise, or a person who is accustomed to labor occasionally receives military training. The most important sign of this disease is that the heart palpitations must be pronounced, and breathing also feels rushed, and the whole body feels fatigued immediately, and even headaches and dizziness. Most doctors blindly diagnose this kind of disease, always saying that a strong person who cannot tolerate exercise must be suffering from beriberi. In fact, it is a big mistake and a special mistake. This kind of symptom is indeed a "labor complication" discovered by Dr. Ribis. Its source is that the heart is active alone and is not connected to the adjustment of the nervous system (sympathetic nerve and parasympathetic nerve). This kind of symptom is definitely not fatigue, but a parasympathetic nerve symptom (delayed pulse and low blood pressure) and a peculiar transformation of the progressing symptom of nerve fatigue (chronic fatigue). If physical training is continued, the "labor complication" can make the abnormality of the physique worse. Therefore, physical strength must gradually decrease. In short, the "labor complication" is just a special case of physical abnormality.</p>
<h3>Current Urgent Matters: Athletes Should Understand Sports Medicine</h3>
<p>The functions of the internal organs of athletes and the condition of their physical constitution, if they can exhibit adaptive changes and their athletic ability can gradually increase with the degree of training.</p>
<p>Slow heart enlargement and low blood pressure, which result in the creation of outstanding physical strength, are actually signs that are not pathological and do not pose any obstacles to health. When athletes undergo health check-ups, these physical changes are often misdiagnosed as internal diseases. Because of this fear, they do not hesitate to give up sports altogether. This kind of influence greatly hinders the overall popularization of sports. Therefore, a solid understanding of the physical changes of athletes is a matter of urgent importance. When diagnosing such physical changes, it is even more important to pay attention to whether they are accompanied by signs of overexertion, and to what extent these changes may cause illness in the future. Athletes who want to examine the current state of their physical constitution must, of course, consult doctors, but the specific degree of change in an athlete's physique can only be recognized by doctors with sports experience. Therefore, the best approach is for each athlete to have a basic understanding of sports medicine, to be good at assessing their individual physical condition, and to control the intensity of their exercise and the amount of rest they take using the safest and most effective methods, so that their bodies do not suffer unexpected illnesses.</p>
<p>▲Methods to Predict Overexertion Rely on Measuring Weight and Lung Capacity</p>
<p>Excessive exercise will inevitably cause physical changes. Symptoms of parasympathetic nervous system and general nervous system fatigue will inevitably increase with the state of fatigue. To identify these signs, one must observe whether the pulse is tense or weakened, whether it is a small pulse (細脈) or a self-reversing pulse, what the pulse rate is, whether it is slow, and whether the heart sounds are weak, and whether there is acute cardiac enlargement. If the above points can be clearly diagnosed, then it can be determined as circulatory fatigue. If tendoperiostitis, facial nerve symptoms, and symptoms of neurasthenia are also found, then it can be proven as "work-related complications." For those with overexertion of the general nervous system, the physical changes will inevitably worsen. Due to metabolic changes, the components of urine are also abnormal, with a sharp increase in the amount of nitrogen in the urine. Therefore, the degree of overexertion can be known by examining the components of urine. In the case of overexertion, weight will decrease as a result, and physical strength will also deteriorate. The rise and fall of physical strength can be measured by testing lung capacity. A decrease in lung capacity is a sign of overexertion. Changes in lung capacity are quite sensitive, so using weight and lung capacity to predict the degree of fatigue is essential. Because this method is relatively simple and easy to implement, if it is possible to fully anticipate the worsening of physical changes, then severe exercise training should be reduced or stopped, and appropriate rest should be taken. Countless athletes have suffered illness or death due to ignorance of sports medicine.</p>

<h3>Hopes for the "Elementary School Student Library"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>The trend of publishing "libraries" in the Chinese publishing industry has only been around for three years. The illustrious "Wan You Library" (Complete Library) can be said to be the first ancestor of libraries.</p>
<p>According to the "Wan You Library" advertisements, buying one "Wan You Library" is like establishing a small library. Not only are the editions neat and tidy, but the catalogs are pre-compiled, the book spines are printed, and the bookshelves are installed. You pay the money today, and the library is set up tomorrow, all that's missing is building the library building for you.</p>
<p>The more libraries there are, the better, so the library organizers should be blessed. But the responsibility of these organizers is also increased because they not only compile catalogs, print book spines, and match bookshelves, but also choose books for you. For example, a well-run tavern is certainly good, but the wine and dishes must all be fresh. But we felt that some of the books in the previous "Wan You Library" were old "leftovers," "recycled" and sold as new products.</p>
<p>Now the Commercial Press is launching the "Elementary School Student Library." It comes in 500 volumes, covering "national science, social sciences, natural sciences, applied technology, art, linguistics, literature, history, and geography; comprehensively equipped; appropriately allocated according to the needs of children." At a time when children's literature is scarce, the emergence of the "Elementary School Student Library" is naturally a blessing to all families; but I hope that it will not be like the previous "Wan You Library," pulling in many "leftovers" to make up the numbers. For example, the "Young People's Series" published twenty years ago - not to say that there is not a single book worth having in the "Young People's Series," but it cannot be denied that most of them are not in line with modern ideas! In addition, many of the children's books on natural science and literature published by the Commercial Press ten years ago also inevitably have omissions and errors; it would be out of the question if they were to become "recycled dried tofu" mixed into this "library."</p>
<p>So, after reading the advertisement for the "Elementary School Student Library," I am anxious to know what exactly the 500 books in the "library" are.</p>
<h3>Writing Letters</h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>Writing letters is one of the modern cultural diseases, similar to dysentery, a spell every now and then, several times a day. But if you get the hang of it, you can alleviate the pain a little. Here are some effective methods:</p>
<p>(1) When writing to important people, register or send by express mail to attract attention; important people receive many letters every day.</p>
<p>(2) For letters asking someone to do something, don't wait for a reply (see item 4), and send a second letter immediately. The second letter should be more polite than the first, as if it is natural that the other party does not reply. In this way, the other party may feel embarrassed not to reply.</p>
<p>(3) For letters asking someone to do something, the envelope and stationery should be exquisite, and the handwriting should not be careless. It is best to send some gifts along with it. Even a letter from a friend asking for help can utilize the blank space on an obituary.</p>
<p>(4) Do not reply to a letter within five days to avoid further trouble. Especially for letters asking for help, leaving them unanswered may just slip by. Who knows if the person seeking help has already found a solution from elsewhere in the shortest period of time? If you receive another letter urging you to do what you were asked, you should still not reply, as if you were severing relations with them. Restore diplomatic relations when you need their help again.</p>
<p>(5) When communicating with strangers, address them as "Teacher."</p>
<p>(6) Do not reply to letters from strangers; if they address you as "Teacher," you can reply with a short letter.</p>
<p>(7) When asking someone to forward a letter, ask someone of higher status than the recipient.</p>
<p>(8) There is no need to put enough postage on return letters; it is even better not to put any.</p>
<p>(9) In order to reduce the suspicion of letter inspectors, letters should be written in classical Chinese, and the more greetings, the better.</p>
<p>(10) If you deliberately want to be inspected (such as letters cursing someone's ancestors), you should write "Received by Miss So-and-so" or "Sent by" on the envelope.</p>
<p>(11) Do not let registered letters fall into the hands of your wife, lest there be money orders inside.</p>
<p>(12) When you see someone else's letter, you should immediately open and read it; after reading it, save it or discard it, as you please.</p>
<p>(13) Return debt collection letters or account statements unopened.</p>
<p>(14) No matter what form you are filling out, leave the "Permanent Mailing Address" blank.</p>
<p>(15) Print a thousand copies of a safe home letter and send them out at any time. This article is not applicable to love letters.</p>
<p>(16) Write love letters and suicide notes at the same time to avoid rushing at the last minute.</p>
<h3>After Watching the "Spring Silkworms" Film</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>The film "Spring Silkworms" is the first Chinese new literary work to be screened. Today, "New Light" (Xin Guang Theater) attracted an unexpectedly large number of viewers. This is indeed worthy of recording.</p>
<p>"Struggling," "Small Toys," "Spring Silkworms," today's advertisements are truly giving people a strong stimulus. Even though the three cinemas are all screening domestically produced films for the first time, even though the sky is overcast and about to rain, I'm afraid everywhere is packed.</p>
<p>Foreign films are only "Eloping," "Bull Road," and "Gold Mountain" that can attract so many viewers.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is deeply meaningful. The progress of Chinese film culture and the progress of Chinese new culture can be reflected in this.</p>
<p>Film has approached literature and art, and literary works have been screened. This is the first thing worth recording.</p>
<p>Film is increasingly approaching the masses and becoming a tool for educating the masses, so that viewers can not only be entertained but also educated in the cinema. This new trend is also worth recording.</p>
<p>This kind of progress in film also reflects the progress of Chinese society. Floods, wars, droughts, locust plagues, and crop failures have led to the bankruptcy of rural China and the unemployment of small urban citizens. But at the same time, Chinese people have become more and more resentful of the imperialists who create these disasters. From the point of view of the subject matter of domestic films and the enthusiastic welcome of the people, the anti-imperialist sentiment of the Chinese people is rising.</p>
<p>The words "imperialist oppression" and the like have been put on the screen, which is in contrast to the imperialists' "beast movies" and African black people's cattle farming videos.</p>
<p>However, although films are practicing the task of educating the public, although they describe the decline of the countryside, although they expose the contradictions in class society, the atrocities of imperialism are not exposed enough. For example, "Spring Silkworms" ultimately did not indicate that the way out for farmers lies in opposing imperialism.</p>
<p>The screen has never shown the "Opium War," nor the "Boxer Rebellion," nor works that truly depict floods, nor authentic films of "September 18th" or "January 28th." This is a great regret.</p>
<p>For example, "Spring Silkworms" only wrote about the bankruptcy of the countryside, the bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons but the starvation of farmers; on the other hand, the invasion of imperialism, the invasion of foreign silk, the incidents of "September 18th," "January 28th," and the various disasters in the country, are not shown at all. It is impossible to see a contrast. This kind of passive writing is indeed a major shortcoming of Chinese literary works and films.</p>
<p>"Roar, China!" We must show the roaring masses in literary works and in films.</p>
<p>Let us see the true face of imperialism in films. The Japanese poet Murayama Tomoyoshi wrote the drama "The Opium War." We need to screen the facts of the Opium War and other imperialist oppressions of China.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (4)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Brother ○○...</p>
<p>In my last letter, I described half a day's journey. Here, I will continue to write about it. The so-called Xianling is the lane between the South and North Mu Mountains. It used to be the only important road to Zhejiang Province when transportation was inconvenient. Therefore, at the highest point of the ridge, a stone city was built against the mountains, garrisoned with soldiers. However, things are different now. With trains and public roads, the stone city, which was a huge engineering project, has become a historical relic. There are no more soldiers, and the stone city is in ruins. The former transportation hub is now used exclusively for driving cattle and horses to the provincial capital. But the scenery here is quite spectacular. On one side of the city gate, you can see the South and North Lakes, the Supervisory Field, the sea, and Changfan, a famous historical site in the sea, as well as Qinzhushan, where Qin Shi Huang lived. On the other side of the city gate, you can even see the sea of ​​Haining, ninety miles away, and the vast and secluded sea of ​​Dajian Mountain. From here, it seems as if it is right in front of you! And what will especially make you sigh is that the stone cities on both sides do not reveal themselves to you when you climb the mountain. Assuming that each side from ridge to ridge is five miles, then you must walk four and a half miles, or even a little more, and after turning the last bend, you can see the city gate, which is not completely hidden by the endless trees, looking like a moon in the distance. After running a little further, you can see the city. This desperate situation, at the time, made us quite exclaim in admiration.</p>
<p>We climbed the mountain, but I couldn’t quite figure out whether we were climbing South Mu or North Mu. But the path up the mountain along the stone city is quite reminiscent of a dead end. A mountain road with stone steps in the jungle lay before us. We climbed step by step, higher and higher. If we had all worn light yellow kasayas, straw sandals, and used an amra to take a few shots, it would have been really interesting. When we reached the top of the mountain and looked at the Mu Mountain opposite, we realized that there was a large village of people on the top of that mountain, just like on this side. But you wouldn't see or think of it unless you went to the top of the mountain. A paradise, that's probably this kind of place. We rested there for a while, which was very nice. One of our companions replied to me, saying that if he really had lung disease, he would definitely die of exhaustion when he was carried up such a high mountain. This sentence made a lot of sense and left me speechless. Continuing along the path on the top of the mountain, turning right, and passing through the jungle, what unexpectedly appeared in front of us was a vast sea. The mountain slopes down diagonally, and nestled in the hollow was the Huangsha Dock, with its extremely beautiful name. There were several tall pine trees in the middle of the hillside. Appreciating the ocean through these trees makes one feel that the meaning is endless. The Chinese sea! The Chinese sea! Here, we understand your vastness, but when will your angry tides, which shake people's souls, come?</p>
<p>After passing the old site of Baiyun Nunnery, built on the top of a mountain facing the sea, I thought that those monks of the past were really "reincarnated" pastoral poets, and they actually found such a magnificent and beautiful place to rest (forgive me for not believing it was for cultivation). But now, there is only this ruin, only this pile of tiles. Could it be that elegance has been extinguished and no one has taken over? I couldn’t help but sigh for the monks and hermits. After descending from here, we arrived at Woding Yunxiu Temple, the most famous temple in Ganpu. Behind this temple is the mountain where one can see the sun and moon rising together on the first day of the lunar calendar. Previous people have written many poems about this, so please forgive this humble person for not doing so. There are very old ginkgo trees in front of this temple, and there are nuns with class consciousness in the temple. Why do I say that the nuns have class consciousness? You can tell from the tea they serve. The rich are given fine tea to drink, and the poor are given coarse tea. I wonder if our Buddha, when he attained enlightenment in the forest for forty-nine days, also saw through this subtlety? From here, we descended the mountain, passed through the winding and lofty mountain paths, crossed the Four Looking Ridge, and walked home. Looking at my watch at the foot of Wanhuang Mountain, the hour and minute hands were pointing exactly at half past four. Two friends each steered a light boat and practiced in the lake, constantly somersaulting.</p>

<h3>Women of Western Fujian</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>1.  Interesting Divorce</p>
<p>This was my first time going to Hubang District. I was already a little tired from running the Buli Road and wanted to rest, but Mr. Guo excitedly said, "Let's go outside for a walk. Today is market day, and people from all the villages are here. The streets are very lively."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go."</p>
<p>I didn't want to disappoint him, so I immediately put down my teacup and followed him and Mr. Chen, who had come with me, to the street. Normally, this is indeed a deserted street. There are only forty or so shops, and they are all dilapidated. The things you can buy inside are limited to the needs of soldiers and villagers. But today is very different. The streets are crowded with men and women wearing straw hats and straw sandals or barefoot. They are carrying all kinds of agricultural products to sell, and everyone is busy trading. We had to use a lot of effort to break through their ranks.</p>
<p>"Hey, Chairman, stop, stop, I have something to talk to you about."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman in her thirties, panting, came running from the crowd.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Mr. Guo asked.</p>
<p>We stopped.</p>
<p>"Regarding my divorce from my husband, it has already been approved by the district committee, but I used ten yuan of his money before, and now I should return it to him. However, I borrowed silver dollars, but now I can only return ten small silver coins because I am poor. Chairman, do you think that's okay?"</p>
<p>Haha, they all laughed loudly. I didn't understand why they were laughing so loudly, and Mr. Guo quickly translated for me.</p>
<p>"So, how did you answer her?" I asked Mr. Guo.</p>
<p>"I answered her that it's best to return silver dollars to him. If that's impossible, small silver coins are also okay, but you have to explain it to him properly."</p>
<p>In this way, the woman thought she had received a satisfactory answer and walked away happily.</p>
<p>"This kind of rare thing is the first time I've ever seen it. No matter what class people are in China today, if they get divorced, it's always the man who gives alimony or divorce fees to the woman... but the women here not only don't need any alimony, but even a few dollars they used have to be paid back. They truly deserve to be called independent women," I said happily to Mr. Guo.</p>
<p>"The most interesting thing is the idea of borrowing silver dollars and returning small silver coins. Although the difference is very small, she thinks it's a very serious problem, so she specifically came to ask for instructions..." Mr. Chen also chimed in, smiling.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the women here are very different from those elsewhere. They not only support themselves, but most of them also support their families. Divorces are always initiated by the women. Husbands who are incompetent or lazy are always worried that their wives will file for divorce," Mr. Guo said happily.</p>
<p>"Then every man has to panic," I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Of course, some of them even rely on their wives to support themselves, so they are even more trembling with fear of losing her."</p>
<p>"This really deserves to be called a women's country!" Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo continued to talk about divorce, but because we had already walked to Coal Mountain, we turned around.</p>

<p>The market is mostly buying near and selling far.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Securities Exchange slightly rebounded. Large investors sold off, and the trend gradually weakened. However, the major bulls are still holding on and buying. The situation in the market is slightly chaotic, and people's hearts are also quite uneasy. At the opening in the morning, the price of the 50th issue rose slightly by about 10% due to buying. Since the beginning of the disarmament, sellers have gradually emerged, and the surface has gradually become smaller. Since then, there have been more sellers than buyers, and the prices have generally decreased by 10% to 45%. There were many sales of the 26th and 38th issues. Although the 50th issue has been well received, the number is still far from equal, so it has been reduced by 34%. At the opening in the afternoon, both the 50th and 53rd issues were well received. At the same time, although the 4th and 11th issues were sold, the supply was still insufficient, so the price increased by another 30%.

Oil, railway, and utility stocks may lead the way. The total number of transactions for the day was 1,030,000 shares. The wheat market news was quite good, but the buyers were lukewarm, resulting in sluggish transactions. Spot goods were quite firm. It is quite favorable to purchase at this low price. It is reported that the Southern government is expected to increase the movement of cotton lending and storage. If so, the decline in cotton prices may be slightly slowed. If this plan receives the support of the majority, it will be very beneficial to the cotton market. The opinions of the brokers are optimistic about the future of the cotton market. The opening of the silver market saw speculators closing their positions, the market situation was loose, and the closing was quite good.

<h3>Yarn and Flower Market: The Yarn Market Remains Scattered</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but most people are psychologically tired. Due to the deteriorating environment, the overseas cotton industry is also weak. However, there are many rumors in the business community that bulls in a certain factory are preparing to receive 10,000 bales of goods, so people's hearts are slightly shaken, and the selling pressure has subsided slightly. However, even at high prices, there is still a sufficient amount of delivery.</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the situation remained firm. However, US cotton saw mixed ups and downs.

Original telegram recorded left (November 11th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grains: River Down Rice Continues to Rise by 12 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is the 245th, mostly new goods, especially new pointed rice being more prevalent than new japonica. Therefore, broken japonica and thin indica rice are quite firm. Furthermore, with the Northern Jiangsu merchants actively moving, the market price rose by about a cent. Various types of new japonica and new pointed rice, due to being in the transition period between old and new crops, have relatively thin inventories in stores. Therefore, unexpectedly, sudden changes occurred. Today, arrivals are slightly scarce, store inventories are strong, and both the North and South Jiangsu merchants are continuing to purchase, resulting in a very brisk situation. The market is active, new japonica is up 1 cent, new pointed rice continues to rise by more than 1 cent, and premium rice is also rising.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 boats from various Jiangsu merchants arrived in Shanghai. Sales continued to increase, with broken japonica rising by 23 cents. New japonica, Baiyuan, Xin Yang Du, and early rice prices increased by 12 cents. Premium rice became more expensive by more than a cent, and customer pointed rice was tight by several cents. Dongxin japonica was flat.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Plunge, then Slightly Recover; Afternoon Factory Covering and Short Covering Lead to Rally</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, each month again showed signs of collapse, with the degree of price drops for each month setting new records that had never been seen before. At the opening price, because Chicago foreign merchants quoted prices, again slightly down 23 cents, Canadian up and down not much. Coupled with the aftermath of sluggish actual sales, people's hearts were depressed. Although this month fell to 1 cent and 5 li, the month to February also reached the 1 cent 56 li mark. Upon inspection, this kind of frenzied plunge was really not caused by factory selling pressure, purely by the long side, disengaging itself step by step, and creating an unprecedentedly tragic fall.</p>
<p>Until the afternoon opening, after the fall, a slight head was seen, with the factory side, because the market came to this tragic scene, all being wary of each recent and distant period, step by step offsetting, and there being off-market long positions, also taking the opportunity to buy, so the market atmosphere rallied. The current situation may be able to temporarily gain a foothold, with the future depending on the spot situation, and then rise and fall again. As a result, this month was unchanged, November was better by 2.5 li, December was better by 7.5 li, January was better by 5 li, February was better by 7.5 li, and March was better by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat: After the opening bell in the morning, each month showed a consistent sign of plummeting. With foreign merchants quoting prices, Chicago was again short 2.2 cents, and Canada was a bit less active. As for the large part of the public, with flour sales being overstocked and stagnant, the position of wheat was naturally linked. Furthermore, the foreign merchants hawking was the fatal injury of this step-by-step crash, because although there is currently no actual settlement, in the future it will be difficult to escape, so the public is fearful, reaching the extreme. At each trade in the morning, it was down 678 cents from the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, at first, it was flat, and then because of the flour market recovery, short covering also competed to replenish each month's market, so it was slightly higher. As a result, November still fell 3 cents, December fell 4 cents, January fell 3 cents, February fell 1 cent, and March fell 3 cents. The spot wheat market saw smooth transactions, and prices entered a fixed trend. Shandong wheat opened at 3 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen, second class wheat at 2 yuan 8 jiao, the next at 7 jiao 1 fen, the next wheat at 1 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen, Daqiao wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao, Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, Yangzhou wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 1/2, and the next 6 jiao, Puzhen wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 1/2, totaling more than 5,000 bags, handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Causes and Consequences of the Tragic Fall in Flour Prices （）</h3>
<p>丨Future Still Difficult to be Optimistic丨</p>
<p>Observation of the World Wheat Market</p>
<p>According to estimates from Brand on European wheat harvests from 1922 to 1933 and from 1931 to 1932, and local wheat harvest estimates, the following is available (unit is tons, 2240 pounds per ton):</p>
<p>192 | 1933 1931 | 19 Year European 4,03,420 39,899,997</p>
<p>United States 13,92,856 19,470,00</p>
<p>Canada 7,178,571 2,477,142</p>
<p>Other 13,349 998 13,122,853</p>
<p>Total 75,942,845 82,969,992</p>
<p>The above excludes production figures for Australia and Argentina, as harvesting is not completed until December 1933. Although it is 8 million tons less than 1932, it can be supplemented by the relatively abundant harvests in the Soviet Union and China. (Note: the above estimates of wheat harvest do not include figures for China and the Soviet Union). If the amount of wheat harvest is such, then future dumping into China remains an undeniable fact. If our agricultural products can also encourage increased planting, it seems that there is no need to worry about the dumping of foreign wheat. They come this way, we go that way, and then we can achieve true resistance. Otherwise, if we only use collateral as a means, and taxation as a clever plan, whether it can prevent foreign dumping is doubtful. As for the current flour price, whether it is a minimum price is even more questionable (end).</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Continues to Rise by About 1 Cent</h3>
<p>▲Harvests Are Uneven Across Regions, the Market Has a Foundation</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer rice gradually rose because the customer merchants were very active in stocking up, and this street also continued to inquire. Customer sales currently only have Xian rice as the most active, but each part of Austria has all arrived at the producing region to pack, and the production price has gradually increased. Transportation is not possible. Furthermore, the harvests of each region are ordinary. The Hunan harvest is 70%, and Zhejiang was affected by the two major storms, and no other port can match the abundant early rice. Domestic rice is mainly based on late rice, but now it is not as good as early rice. But with a good harvest of early rice, it will not affect the market. However, the foundation of the rice market has been able to stand. Yesterday, Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian Province were both keen to purchase, totaling 500 bags of Hunan rice handled at a price of 6 yuan 67 cents, and 300 bags of rice at a price of 6 yuan 2 cents to 5 yuan 7 jiao 1/2, Anqing rice 50 bags at a price of 6 yuan 9 jiao 8 1/2, Jiangbei Xian rice 130 bags at a price of 6 yuan 9 jiao 1/2, Nanjing factory Xian rice 500 bags at a price of 7 yuan 1 cent, and this street handled 200 bags of early Jiangxi rice at a price of 6 yuan 7 cents, 500 bags of Nanjing car Xian rice at a price of 7 yuan and 6 yuan 9 jiao 1/2, and 700 bags of brown rice at a price of 5 yuan 8 jiao, which is 1 jiao and 67 cents higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Wufu Bai Shui, Long Silent, Resumes Movement 丨Opening at 18 Yuan 4 Jiao 丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a small amount of capital in the afternoon, and the trend was flat. The association divided 24 coarse sand white, and the initial market price for general circulation was 21 yuan 6 jiao 1/2, which later traded at 6 jiao 2 fen, which was 1 fen lower than the previous day. Red sugar was firm, No. 9 was 16 yuan 9 jiao, Nos. 8 and 9 ordinary was 16 yuan 7 jiao 1/2 to 2 jiao 1/2. Taikoo Fine B had a slight transaction at 21 yuan 6 jiao 1/2. China China Cotton White Top No. 27 jiao 1/2, No. 1 5 jiao 1/2, Zhenji No. 1 20 yuan 6 jiao, the rest retreated 2 jiao each. Qing opened more than 100 bags of ordinary yellow, 15 yuan 4 jiao to 2 jiao 1/2, the standard Wufu Bai Shui, because the vendors were unwilling to sell cheaply, insisted on 18 yuan 1/2, and yesterday more than 200 bags were opened, with a price of 18 yuan 4 jiao per bag. Brothers opened dozens of boxes of water, 17 yuan 1/2.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Thick Woolen Cloth is Selling Briskly</h3>
<p>Thick overcoat woolen cloth and flat thick woolen cloth are currently selling briskly. Both the Chongqing and Northern Jiangsu merchants are adding purchases. Tailor shops and overcoat workshops on the street also have demand. Good Hua colorful flashing thick woolen cloth sold 8 boxes yesterday, priced at 5 yuan 4 jiao per yard. Ningfeng gray plaid sold 2 boxes, priced at 6 yuan. Zhao overcoat woolen cloth sold 5 boxes, priced at 4 yuan 1/2. Hualun and Ruiwen dotted flower overcoat woolen cloth opened more than 10 boxes, priced at 4 yuan 1/2 to 5 yuan 2 jiao 1/2. Many are submitting notes to foreign firms. It is said that more than 70 pieces came out of the East and West Shanghai godowns. This godown delivered 340 boxes. According to the weather, the thick overcoat woolen cloth will be in demand, so the goods written off last month have recently been cleared out.</p>

<h3>Strange Note Found Under Incense Burner: Second Tale of Palace Secrets by a Former Palace Maid</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Wanxia, a former maid of the Chuxiu Palace, is now Ms. Li Guizhen of Beiping. She recounts two palace secrets, as well as two strange notes found under the incense burner, briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The fire at Jianfu Palace was a vision of more than a decade ago. The people in the palace were simply perplexed by the land god. Because of being perplexed by the land god, they burned down their ancestral hall. Afterwards, rumors spread, all complaining that Master Zhuang had offended the ancestors by taking pictures in the ancestral hall, and therefore, this magnificent fire was brought down.</p>
<p>Originally, Jianfu Palace was the ancestral hall and Buddhist hall of the Imperial Palace, in which were enshrined statues of gods and Buddhas, and portraits of ancestors. Puyi's teacher, the Englishman Zhuang Shigao, insisted on going to the ancestral hall, which no outsiders could enter, to admire it. Not only did he admire the portraits, but he also photographed the ancestral portraits there. Puyi agreed, satisfying Master Zhuang's request, but the people in the palace were frightened, fearing that they had angered the ancestors. Sure enough, a few days later, the eunuch in charge of the palace found a note under the incense burner in the Buddhist hall that read, "You mess with me, I won't mess with you." At that time, he did not dare to report it, fearing that he would be punished for fabricating divine writings. Who knew that a few days later, Jianfu Palace caught fire for no reason, burning to the ground. The eunuch in charge knew that his crime was not small when the fire was raging, so he wanted to jump into the fire pit with the portraits of the ancestors and turn to ashes. But he was dragged back by other eunuchs, who asked him about the fire. He then told them that after Master Zhuang took the photos, he found the note under the incense burner. After reporting to Puyi, Puyi said, "This is the will of Heaven," and did not punish the eunuch in charge.</p>
<p>Outsiders are very clear about the situation of the fire at Jianfu Palace. It was clear that the eunuchs had stolen and sold the sacrificial vessels in the palace, fearing that Puyi would find out, so they set a fire to make the case impossible to investigate, and everything turned to ashes. When the fire was raging, they pretended to jump into the fire pit, and called their companions to pull them back. They also fabricated a note under the incense burner, claiming that the ancestors were angry because Master Zhuang had taken the photos. These were all pre-arranged steps to fool Puyi. Puyi had been a puppet, and now he was a puppet of the Japanese. This puppet show was truly his best performance.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Chen Peiren</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>The revolutionary poet Mr. Chen Peiren has unfortunately passed away. Many people probably know about his revolutionary career, so there is no need to say more. In these few years, he has not</p>
<p>Some came out, seeing that in the capital, there was no room for a haggard man, how could one not be angered to death!</p>
<p>The old gentleman did not want to be an official, but he was simply not qualified to be one. After drinking his fill of old wine, he had to scold people. The anecdotes of those newly rich were all in his inopportune stomach, and when he said them, the listeners were shocked.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was only given those high hats like the director of an orphanage-style Jiangsu Revolutionary Museum, and the compiler of the Jiangsu Gazetteer. Later, he simply tightened up and returned to his hometown with vigor.</p>
<p>But the old gentleman did indeed have a desire for tranquility and detachment. In his later years, he had a son, and he was happy to have him around his knees. He built a tomb for his mother, erected a memorial tablet, built a pavilion, planted flowers and trees, and the tomb of Longgang was not desolate. He also added several houses to his old residence, as a refuge. This summer, he went to the Baoben Temple in Suzhou to listen to the sutras, and even wanted to convert to Buddhism. He wrote to me, even calling himself "Nà". He celebrated his sixtieth birthday and wrote four seven-character poems. Who knew that less than half a month later, he would suddenly pass away. His disciples are preparing to publish his twenty-five kinds of Hao Ge Tang Series, but just as they were starting, he died, and it is not known whether there will be any obstacles to this matter? Because "people are in people, feelings are in it."</p>
<p>The last time I drank with him was on June 20th. He brought me a bunch of Kuei Chou Revolutionary documents, and I was afraid to drink because of a toothache. He said that drinking more wine would also cause a toothache, but his interest in wine was still unabated. Later, we drank tea together in Wu Yuan, and he was in good spirits. In July, I went to his hometown to visit him, but he had gone to the Baoben Temple, but I was still in Suzhou. I did not go to the Baoben Temple to visit him, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Soon I will also publish his textual research on the word "Lang" in Chunmiao. But since I received this letter, I have not seen another piece of paper from him, so I will keep this last letter to commemorate our friendship despite the age difference.</p>
<p>The old gentleman's lack of property is probably also a characteristic of poets. Although it is not necessarily desolate after his death, but apart from a few houses of books, there is nothing else to speak of. Devoting himself to seven lives for forty years, such is his return. Alas!</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Shao Long</p>
<p>On this trip to the capital again, here are a few impressions for reference:</p>
<p>Since January 28th, the city of Beijing has become increasingly desolate. Banks stand in large numbers, but they do not lend money. The financial situation of the money houses is difficult to maintain. Financial circulation is not smooth, and purchasing power is weak. Major stores have little trade each day. New houses on the market have been available for rent for a long time, but no one lives in them. The southern section of Taiping Road is mostly without lights at night. Only the Confucius Temple area, with its bookstores and restaurants, is more developed in business. The outward appearance is strong, but the inside is weak, which can be seen at a glance. According to a certain gentleman in the business world, Nanjing's production has always been dominated by the silk industry, followed by leather. Currently, silk workers are unemployed, and they rely on leather as a source of income. Half of the leather is in transit. If this continues, the wealth of the landlords will dry up day by day. I don't know what will happen in the end? In the capital, in addition to national and municipal schools, there are many private schools. Most of them are not good. Jinling University and Zhongying Anhui Middle School have a long history and good grades. However, since Jinling University was taken back and run independently, the spirit is not as good as before. Not to praise foreigners, the English textbooks used are similar to those of other schools, not like in the past when American textbooks were used from elementary school, so it was easy to go directly to universities in that country.</p>
<p>The capital's municipal administration is still in a transitional period. Construction is mostly stalled. Especially the drinking water in the south of the city is of the worst quality, which is harmful to hygiene. The authorities in Beijing do not pay attention to it, which is incomprehensible. The train stations in the city are full of twilight, which is unbearable to look at. It is the capital's appearance, and it should not be like this.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, except for some members of the Central Committee who are not in Beijing, the heads of various ministries and commissions take turns traveling to various places, asking for leave and returning to duty, which is quite free. Daily affairs are mostly handled by the permanent and deputy secretaries. Slightly important matters are mostly reported to the superiors by telegram. The most important matters must still be discussed and executed at meetings in political centers. Therefore, this kind of procedure greatly affects the efficiency of political speed. This is what a certain gentleman in the political world said; I don't know if it is true? (Not paid)</p>
<h3>Let's Have Fun First, Then Talk</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Hey, isn't today the "National Day Anniversary" of our Republic of China? What "lost land has not been recovered, and the rivers and mountains have changed color," these are all "national humiliations," not "national celebrations," damn it. The annual "National Day" is not more than the several "national humiliations" a year, one after another. Today, it is rare to celebrate "National Day," so how can we spoil the fun with talk of "national humiliation"? It is rare, our Republic of China has not completely perished! Now only the northeast corner is gone, what is so rare? If we don't take this opportunity to have fun, when will we?</p>
<p>If you have "McMac" around, then on this legitimate "National Day," the cinema and dance hall are must-go places to have fun. Otherwise, buy half a catty or eight taels of "white liquor" for a few coppers an ounce, and get drunk, which is also fun.</p>
<p>You should understand, what day is today? Today is the "National Day Anniversary" of our Republic of China, not the anniversary of the loss of the Three Eastern Provinces in 19181. Although the lost land has not been recovered, "National Day" is still "National Day." Friends! See through it, it is rare that our Republic of China has not completely perished on today's "National Day," go to the cinema, go to the dance hall, or drink "white liquor," as you please, let's have fun first, then talk! If you are groaning without illness about the unreclaimed lost territory, muttering, "What is there to celebrate in such a country," then you are a big fool.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Sour and Sorrowful Feelings Still Offer Blessings; Busy Military Affairs Secretly Transfer the Army</p>
<p>At the same time, he thought that no matter what, he should take the time to go home today. The departure date was probably imminent, so he should go early and settle the family affairs. Especially the Yang family mother and daughter, he really felt a little ashamed. They had long expressed a skeptical attitude, fearing that soldiers could not often be at home. Now that he was just engaged, he was indeed leaving. He had to go and comfort them. As he thought about it, he took out the drafts and accounts from his desk. He read two pages, intending to leave after he finished reading them, but then the platoon leader He came. He saluted, straightened his face, and said in a very gentle tone, "The platoon leader wants to plead with the company commander to borrow some money to go home and settle things." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Borrowing money is a pain I feel as much as everyone else. I really can't give you much. I can only lend you three dollars. If you really need it, there's no way. I'd rather use two dollars less and give you five dollars. As for asking for leave to go home, according to human sentiment, there's nothing I can't agree to. But think about it, there are only twenty-one or two hours left. If you go home again, will you have time to do things?" Platoon Leader He said, "I beg the company commander to make a special exception. I guarantee I'll be back within three hours. I have two or three children at home, and an old mother who is sixty-eight years old. I can't bear not to see them before I leave." As he said this, his voice became a little stiff, almost crying. At this point, how could Zhao Ziqiang not grant his leave? So he said, "All right, go back. Just be sure to go early and come back early, and don't make me exhausted." Platoon Leader He saluted and turned to leave. Zhao Ziqiang stared at the many documents on the desk, unable to react. He thought to himself, with Platoon Leader He gone, I'll have to worry even more about the affairs of his platoon. The chance to sneak away and go home is even smaller. He sighed, and simply read all the documents. So he held back his breath and buried himself in his work again. After reading the documents, he ran to each platoon to supervise the soldiers packing their things, then ran to the warehouse to check the guns and ammunition. The regiment hadn't sent the money, so he didn't dare to ask for it directly. He had to find the battalion commander to urge him.</p>

<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3>Returning from Huawu</h3>
<p>— Shen Hengzhuang</p>
<p>I have long admired the name "Huawu", but when people arrive in Hangzhou, because of time or other reasons, they often forget this scenic spot located in Xixi. Our group was no exception, having been to Hangzhou several times, but only this time did we experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>The opportunity arose like this: as soon as we arrived in Hangzhou, the strategist Zhou Shixun decided on the itinerary. Starting from Shixun's father-in-law's new house on Fayuan Road, we walked to Liuxia. This was a very long route. In order to increase everyone's interest, we had to follow his original plan and start walking. Leading the way was Shixun's father-in-law, the sixty-year-old Mr. Wang Zhongheng, and bringing up the rear was the strategist Zhou Shixun.</p>
<p>Walking and walking, we were indeed extremely tired. We rested in an open-air cool pavilion at the intersection of Huawu Road, preparing to restore the original power of our legs before continuing. Coincidentally, the strategist suddenly discovered a good article on the wall of the cool pavilion: "Huawu is the most scenic place in the Xixi area. There are many monasteries in the valley, with secluded forests and springs, and pleasant flowers and birds. The evening bells and fish drums echo in the distance, and the creek reflects the moon, and the pine trees fan the wind. Being in it is like being on the Shanyin Road, with too much to take in, and there is no worldly burden to disturb you. It is not without people who have hidden in this mountain and spent their old age in the clouds and mist." The writer of this couplet is called Jianlong Daoist. Of course, after we and the rest of the group respectfully read this article containing guidance, Shixun was the first to advocate changing the original plan and advancing towards Huawu. Sure enough, it was a beautiful place. The Huawu, about a mile away, was entirely surrounded by mountains and valleys. At this time, it was raining heavily, and all the bamboo in the valley was washed as green as jade, contrasting with the red flowers in the valley. Adding to this was the sound of the stream, which was like listening to a stringless zither, open and relaxing, making people fascinated. At this time, we were a little thirsty. According to the people in the cool pavilion, we could knock on the door to borrow tea from every monastery in the valley. However, although we saw many thatched huts standing in the forest, we were timid and did not dare to try because the doors were always closed. As a result, we publicly elected Shixun as an executive committee member to explore the "Qinglian Nunnery". After a push and knock from him, a female Taoist priest near thirty opened the mountain gate, greeted us with a smile that had a deep "flavor of the Dharma," and welcomed our group of virtuous men to sit down.</p>
<p>"Qinglian Nunnery," if we were to describe it in the style of an artist's sketch, only the word "lonely" could represent everything. Accompanying this Taoist priest to the end of her life were only the faint solitary lamp and several thousand bamboo trees.</p>
<p>After eating "Suzhou melon seeds" and wiping our faces with "perfume", we began to talk. The Taoist priest handed Shixun a card written in the official script. Her Dharma name was "Miaoguang." Indeed, it was true to her name. Shixun also praised her face as being somewhat like the Guanyin of the South Sea.</p>
<p>The conversation progressed from Qinglian Nunnery to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to the former Lulan Spring Pavilion's Ruilong and Lianying. This surprised us greatly. Having been a Taoist priest for ten years, she had not forgotten the worldly affairs of the past. She reflected them as if they were treasures, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>After two hours, we were, after all, virtuous men, and seeing that it was getting late, we took the opportunity to say goodbye, so as not to cause the Taoist priest to be fearful. Leaving the nunnery gate, Mr. Wang thanked her with two dollars, and after repeated refusals, she finally accepted. She sent us all the way to the stream, and before leaving, she said to Shixun, "Next time you can write a letter to inform me, and I can personally prepare vegetarian food to wait for you." Shixun thanked her and said goodbye. The group then cheered up again and toured "Liuxia." At six o'clock, we took a public bus back to the Lakeside.</p>
<p>After returning home, we asked Shixun to show us the card. He seemed very reluctant to take it out from a multi-layered wallet in his vest pocket, give it to us for a moment to look at, and then return it to its tight place.</p>
