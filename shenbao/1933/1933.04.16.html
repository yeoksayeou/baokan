<h3 id="c28">農村衰頽之因果信 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>我國農村瀕於破産。已爲當前迫於眉睫之急難。前年之水災。遍長江流域各省區。足使國民陷於絶境。去年之豐收。就一般常識推測。似應聊紓民困矣。而事實所表現者。適陷﹁榖賤傷農﹂之故轍。匪特貧瘠省區農民。日常生活難於維持。即號稱富庶之江浙。亦多處於極困難境地。蓋前年水災之後。中等以下之自耕農。莫不賴借貸以維繫其生活。去年雖豐收。而榖價陡跌。每石稻值平均不過二元八角。以之折算人工肥料田賦捐稅等。尚虞不給。對前年天災所負之積。何能償還。</p>
<p>而外國米麥麫粉之進口。民國二十一年度。三項總值二億○六百萬海關兩。其中洋米竟稱第一。此種形勢。日益加甚。殆爲近年來我國國民經濟現狀最大之危機。其初政府固未嘗預籌對策。民間亦膜不關心。迄於今年。危機日漸顯露。農村破敗。且已明白影響於城市。滬漢平津以至廣州等處。均顯示市面凋零狀况。進出口貿易。不能保持收支之平衡。加以世界經濟恐慌之深化。銀價遂愈低舊。我國一般社會。更顯頽廢。今試縱觀世界各國亦莫不呻吟於此恐慌狂潮激盪之中。美國小農負債。竟有一百二十億以至一百五十億美金。德國農村負債。亦有一百十億馬克以上。日本農村負債。不下七十億日金。我國區域廣闊。素乏精密統計。但就一般情勢推測。農民　務之重壓。必較上述諸國更爲嚴重也。</p>
<p>我國去年旣稱豐稔。據中國銀行營業報告所　。米之收程約增加百分之三十。主計處調查蘇浙湘贛皖桂等八　産米。即有五億七千二百九十七萬七千餘擔。産麥有一億七千五百餘萬擔。宜乎一般人應無乏食之虞。國家有充裕之資矣。何以洋米洋麥。仍源源流入。而災荒且續演不已耶。例如漢中豐收。麥價跌至去年春初二分之一。乃關中渭水南北各縣。竟至無處求食。又如五原附近榖米潰濫。而平津乃輸入外國麫粉。蓋交　不便。儘其末　。人事之阻滯。捐稅之苛刻。則更足使農産物品不能步出産地。我國農村。原憧憬於自給自足之理想社會。自海禁大開。資本主義的商品輸入以來。此種理想。即爲廉價商品所破碎。農村榖物生産。雖遠至新疆蒙古西藏等滯留於牧畜時代之地域。其生産品。亦轉入於商品化之途中。换言之。即不能不略受世界經濟恐慌之影響。矧又加以人事的摧殘。九一八瀋變。東北農民。誠受不可彌補之損失。而山東河北移住農民。遂亦斷絶其開發之新路。過剩人口。無處消納。西北榖倉之五原。又以措置乖方。任隨兵匪縱横。致使山西河北之農民。皆裹足不前。坐令耕地荒廢。長江流域。腹地省分。則苦於流動之匪亂。匪去兵來。雞犬且受其禍。人民祇求逃死。即至秩序較佳之江浙。一則以榖價奇賤致負債累累。難於繼續經營。再則以生絲猛跌。茶葉停銷。副業亦苦無補助。則是農民生活。幾至絶境矣。至於閩粤所以較爲富裕之原因。原僅恃華僑海外之匯欵。現在南洋市面日壞。美國經濟恐慌加深。（我國全國對外收支已無可彌縫）廣東又何從以維持其舊時繁榮耶。是以次殖民地之我國農村。遂愈充滿其悲觀材料而不堪設想。</p>
<p>今後自救之道。恐非僅以提倡農民敎育鄉村自治舉辦保甲維持秩序等消極方案所克有濟。此種方案。在三十年前或可收效一時。國短時期之一小康。﹂今則時移勢易。最低限度。亦應流通農村經濟。取消高利貸。週轉農村金融。使農産不致停滯。以濟目前之急。而根本解决。端在土地問題。必須土地問題有正確之答案。而後國家百年大計。乃得而樹立也。</p>

<p>伍定財長反對膨脹通貨貶落金價</p>
<p>紐約銀行已輸出金貨一批往荷蘭</p>
<p>國民社十四日華盛頓電　今夜接近政府者聲稱、美財長伍定無論如何將反對添印貨幣、或貶落美金價值、一般金融家大多數信此語意義殆可視爲羅斯福總統亦必同抱此意、國會内膨脹通貨派勢將暫停活動、至少俟諸世界經濟會議以後、按國會内貶落金元價值運動之猛進、與國外市塲美金跌價之猛速、在星期四已達於不能不有所行動之時期、因此政府特准許紐約某銀行輸出金貨一批、運往荷蘭、以資挽救、現國會議員與金融專家皆信美總統在今後數日内對於膨脹通貨問題諒亦將有切實聲明云、</p>
<p>國民社十四日華盛頓電　自美國金元在國外之匯兌市塲受多年未見之貶值後、今日聯邦儲備局發表已有紐約某銀行領得運金往荷蘭之執照、惟運金數量及銀行行名均未披露、據稱、當道此舉爲免美國金元在國外市場貶值更鉅起見、</p>
<p>今日雖爲假期、金融家仍多往辦事之所閱看最近報告、且據多人聲稱、逆料不久將可開弛金禁、至少亦可開禁一部份、因美國金元價值、在今後數日内必須加以有力之維持、但即令有少數金貨運出國外、亦足以制止金元之貶值、且觀於金融界最近狀况、不妨再允許運出金貨數批、故金融界刻正注意美總統防止金元再行貶值之行動、蓋美國會内白銀與膨脹通貨派之活動、及加拿大總理將與美總統討論重定世界存金價值之可能性等消息、已使金元大受打擊、故此間觀察時局者皆信苟不大弛金禁、則唯有准金元之更貶價值、而一般經濟家則信、倘美總統能立刻有所舉措制止金元之跌價、未嘗不可視爲其對於膨脹通貨態度之表示、美總統自就任以來、對於貨幣除聲稱有適宜供給穏固貨幣之必要外、尚未有他種聲明、</p>
<p>至聯邦儲備銀行存金報告、昨日增加八·七○○·○○○元、而前此在十二日爲止之一週間、則業已增加八·三九七·○○○元、查兩項增加原因、由於外國存金賬内數量減少、及中國·拉丁美洲·澳洲與其他國家等均有黄金輸美所致、中國共輸美一○二·○○○元、澳洲輸美二六七·○○○元、拉丁美洲各國共三一·○○○元、以故照此情形、金禁似可稍加寛鬆云、</p>

<p>俄經理言此案羅織而成</p>
<p>路透十四日莫斯科電　今日英技師案開第三日審訊、雖麥克唐諾翻供不認有罪、但推事認其</p>
<p>原供爲有效　日所要點、蘇訊爲桑頓所給與俄技師杜爾戈夫人欵三千盧布、究爲一種借欵、抑係賄賂、杜爾戈夫聲稱、渠視此欵爲不正當之給予、故渠將此欵交與當局、渠問心無愧云、杜氏雖自以爲是、但其直率之答詞、頗引起良好印象、桑頓聲稱、此係借欵、但渠未曾掣取手據、因杜氏謂不必出收據也云、法庭繼訊問起訴文中麥克唐諾與諾德華</p>
<p>自承怠工事　蘇夫迦電廠透平機室主科特寥萊夫斯基氏稱、渠因麥克唐諾之請、以大釘擲入發電機中、將馬達毁壞、麥氏酬以盧布千枚、渠又以蘇夫迦廠圖樣一張給與麥氏云、其他證人皆謂諾德華唆使彼等怠工、而彼等亦遵囑辦理云、又有一證人謂諾德華曾</p>
<p>給五千盧布　諾德華在旁聞此供詞、大爲駭異、當即向堂上切實聲明、凡此證詞、悉屬虚僞、堂上又訊及諾德華與某證人間之皮衣買賣、諾德華稱、此皮衣係另一英技師所有、託渠代售與某證人、取到現資、而轉寄於物主云、檢察官維興斯基對於諾德華今日之供詞、與其在開審前所繕具之供詞、稍有出入之處、大肆秤擊、蘇俄政府行政長官賴台克今日亦到庭觀審、法庭</p>
<p>休息三小時　後、復傳諾德華上堂詰問、諾德華答詞簡短而堅决、印象極佳、維克公司俄職員阿倫尼克答堂上之問、謂某透平機裝置之不善、應由諾德華負責、因諾氏未察知圖樣紙中之錯誤也、諾德華當即辯稱、渠未見有何錯誤、即專家委員會亦未發見之、渠絶無幸災樂禍之意云、有一俄人名薛白特、到堂作證、謂渠從未供職於維克公司、但渠與桑頓友善、桑頓告以公司</p>
<p>機器極精美　無過分察騐之必要、渠查見開閉器有缺陷、致工作不能迅速、曾告知桑頓、桑向之致謝、並授以三百盧布云、桑頓聞言、即立起否認、謂渠曾給薛白特二百五十盧布、此係獎勵金、因薛工作良好也云、薛白特復稱、渠尊重桑頓而信其言、</p>
<p>故開始怠工　又稱、英人被告格萊戈立到德尼泊羅斯特羅後、即作反蘇俄之宣傳云、格萊戈立爲英國威爾斯人、係維克公司裝機技師、聞薛氏供詞後、即大聲慷慨致詞曰、此人侮辱我、毁我名譽、而推事聽之、不加詰問、此豈公道乎、推事止之曰、爾其就事實發言、今爲　　爾發言之時　格萊戈立乃繼續致詞、謂渠往德尼泊羅斯特羅裝置油機、渠工作極爲愼重、爲維持公司名譽計也、格氏旋向坐於法庭一隅之專家委員會曰、余於四十八天内共裝油機三具各重四十五噸、余辦事是否良好、請專家判定之、</p>
<p>余不解俄語　何能向工人宣傳、余指導俄人工作、已無寗晷、且余從不注意政治云、最後證人爲索柯魯金、其人乃莫斯科電廠之副技師長、亦爲被告之一、謂曾受桑頓贈給二千五百盧布爲怠工費、桑頓囑其於</p>
<p>戰爭時毁壞　主要電廠、以破壞俄國電氣工業、桑頓與渠曾共同商定怠工計畫云、桑頓立即否認有此談話、並否認有向之行賄情事、此案審至今夜十時始退庭、</p>
<p>鮑羅廷亦到庭觀審者之一、</p>
<p>路透十五日莫斯科電　維克公司英職員六俄職員十二被控行賄間諜怠工案、今晨復審、甫開庭、維克公司駐俄經理孟克賀斯即立起稱、余欲有言、余被盤詰十八小時之久、余敢言此次控案乃羅織而成、余聞昨日索柯魯金之供詞後、余願證明此案係以受威脅的俄人之供詞爲根據、孟氏言至此、推事亟止其發言、旋有一班自承怠工者上堂侯質、莫斯科電力廠總技師克拉盛寗諾柯夫聲稱、維克機器確有缺陷、渠因受囑不得呈報、故未呈報云、孟克賀斯即揷言曰、余承認機器確發生若干缺點、但余不信克拉盛寗諾柯夫爲怠工者、克答曰、但余信余乃怠工者、又一莫斯科電力廠俄職員梭林到堂作證、指桑頓給以一千盧布、囑其怠工、桑頓聞之神色不變、推事今日宣佈、此案明日可審畢、</p>

<h3 id="c163">專件葉澄衷先生傳 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>葉成忠先生字澄衷、浙江鎭海人、他的母親姓洪、父親呌志禹、是一個農民、</p>
<p>當他六歲的時候、他的父親便死了、兄弟共三人、與母甇甇相依、家裏又貧困不堪、僅剩破屋一間、母子兄弟日常在飢餓冷凍迫害之中、九歲的時候、他才得入塾讀書、但不到半年、終以家貧半途輟學了、這一事實給予了他的幼小心靈以一個强烈的剌激、他從此理解了貧苦子弟想求得知識的艱難、同時更實騐了貧苦子弟失學的悲痛、這種理解和實騐便正是他日後創辦澄衷蒙學堂的遠因、</p>
<p>十一歲的時候、他入了鄰近的油坊做傭工、過了三年、傭工生活終以待遇大苛、辭去、離油坊後生活更苦、甚至無以爲生、同鄉倪先生哀憐他的遭遇、又敬重他的誠寶、便邀他同來上海、當時從鎭海來上海僅需旅費兩千文、可是這兩千文旅費、也還是他的母親用田中秋禾抵押得來的、這種艱苦的境遇和磨折、又正是他日後努力奮鬥成就事業的動力、</p>
<p>到上海後倪先生便薦他到法租界某雜貨店裏去當學徒、這時候正當鴉片戰爭之後、帝國主義者已用砲艦聞開了我國的門户、上海亦已開闢爲商埠、黄浦江中外商船舶麕集他每日淸晨駕一小船、載雜貨、往來外商船舶間呌賣、回店後還要洒掃做飯、終日没有片刻的休息、他在這樣的生活狀態下、過了三年、又因店主的昏樻而辭去、這時候他已經是十七歲了、三年的學徒生活、使他略得謀生的門徑、更確定了他的獨立生活的决心、所以他這一次離開雜貨店、便正是他的獨立生活的起點、也便是他的事業的開頭、</p>
<p>脫離雜貨店後、他仍舊日駕一小船、往來浦江中呌賣、刻苦耐勞和從前在店時一樣、這樣又過了很久的時候、他更學會了經商的本領、尤其重要的、是他了解了這麕集浦江的船舶、便都是侵略中國的利器、這種了解是他的思想上一次劃期的轉變、使他立下了補塞巵漏挽回利權的偉大的志願、</p>
<p>一八二六年卽前淸同治元年、他盡力籌措、開始在裏虹口設一小店、那年的冬季、又移到外虹口、小規模的經營、獲利當然是極爲微薄、然而他對内能刻苦耐勞、對外能以至誠待人、建築起市塲上的信用、這樣、他的生意便日益發達、規模也日益擴大、從前局促於外虹口的那一月規模狹小的店舗、不到幾年、分店竟遍於全國、從前貧苦無以自存的葉先生、到現在也就一躍而爲全國實業界有力領袖、這種成功、當然是由於他的勤儉自持誠信待人和過人的才智精力、﹁有志者事竟成、﹂誰說葉先生成功是偶然的呢、</p>
<p>然而葉先生眞正的成功還不止於此、眞正的事業也不在於此、因爲他認淸了要補塞漏巵、要挽回利權、商業上的競爭、還是第二着、而最重要的則是振興國内的工業、只有振與工業才能抵制外國産品的侵入、也只有工業振興才能從事商業上的競爭、於是他　在上海和漢口創辦火柴工廠和繅絲工廠、規模很大、這便是我國晨初的火柴工業和繅絲工業、實在、道時候、雖說歐洲的資本主義先進國家已發達成熱、而爲帝國主義、正在加緊開闢井競奪海外的市塲、停滯在農業經濟的中國、便正在他們競爭的目標、但當時資本主義列强在中國的勢力、還是非常薄弱、基礎也還没有穏固、假使我們能趁着這樣的時候奮起維新、究竟爲時未晚、一八六八年日本的明治維新運動、便正是眼前的一個好榜樣、然而當時的滿淸政府竟終始不能覺悟、雖說其後也曾有遇一八九八年的﹁戊戌變法、﹂也終以舊勢力的壓迫、歸於失敗、從此帝國主義者對我國進攻便日益猛烈、其在華勢力亦日益　圖、處於此種情勢之下、我國農業經濟旣日益崩潰、民族、</p>
<p>工業又因帝國主義者之桱梏而無法抬頭、在不斷的朽腐崩潰不斷的被侵害之過程中、中國終於淪入了半殯民地的地位、迄至目前、仍莫能自拔、這、也許葉先生始　所不及的　、然而、正以此而益以見葉先生眼光的遠大啊、</p>
<p>其次、葉先生事業上最值得我們注意的、是﹁積財而能散財、﹂他能不爲錢所用、不爲錢所累、能使社會的錢仍用之於社會、晚年、他建懷德堂以安孤寡、建忠孝堂以安族黨、又設義塾及牛痘局以安赤貧、其他如興書院、通水利、治道路、修橋梁、建崇義會與廣義會、救濟奉晋豫燕魯蘇浙諸省的災荒、他無不慷慨捐輸、就中我們應該特别提出的、卽是本校的創設、</p>
<p>本校丨澄衷中學、起初是呌做澄衷蒙學堂、由於小時失學的剌激、葉先生特捐虹口張家灣地二十八畝、銀十萬兩、創辦澄衷蒙學堂、使貧苦子弟都得有一求學的　會、正在計劃開始建造的時候、葉先生怱起病、病終不起、死時再三叮囑他的家屬說、﹁我死、你們必須完成我創辦蒙學堂的志顧、﹂又遺書校董樊棻陳祖烈先生等說、﹁澄衷少孤貧、自愧失學、久欲建立學堂、以濟貧寒子弟、事方經始而末疾侵尋、慮先朝露　、諸君子相交有　、必能曲體微忱、勉襄是舉、﹂這是正是一八九九年、卽前淸光緒二十五年、</p>
<p>次年、一九零零年、葉先生的兒子貽鑑先生秉承遺志、再捐銀十萬兩、一九零二年、貽釗貽銘貽銓貽綺貽鏞貽鈺諸先生也合捐銀十萬兩、校舍於一九零零年（淸光緒二十六年九月）開工、一九零一年（淸光緒二十七年一月）竣工、同年四月十六日開學（光緒二十七年二月二十八日、）這便是本校的由來、也便是葉先生最偉大不朽的事業、我們丨本校全體師生丨在今日瞻仰葉澄衷先生的遺像、回想從前那因貧苦失學的九歲小孩、回想從前那傭工油坊的十一歲小孩、回想從前那駕小船往來浦江呌賣的靑年由他畢生的艱苦奮鬥、使我們今日能有讀書的機會、我們應該怎樣努力、應該怎樣勤勉、以期不負葉澄衷先生的始願呢、看、葉澄衷先生的遺像、不是朝朝暮暮睜大眼睛督促着我們、期望着我們嗎、</p>
<p>葉澄衷先生的畢生、卽是奮鬥的别名、他的成功也正是由於他肯奮鬥、他有如炬的眼光、沸騰的熱情、他的事業、他的人格、絶對不是什麽死了後的﹁賞戴花翎﹂、﹁二品頂戴﹂、﹁榮祿大夫、﹂或其他不相干的譽詞所能表揚、就以創辦本校一事而言、也就够他永垂不朽了、</p>
<p>葉澄衷先生生於一八四零年七月十八日（淸道光庚子年六月二十日、）死在一八九九年十一月五日、（淸光緒已亥年十月初三日、）陳彬龢、澄衷中學立校三十二週年紀念日、</p>

<p>（九）南京唯明君來信丨由農村問題說到靑年之出路</p>
<p>記者先生。關於﹁回到農村﹂這個問題。我有一些簡單意見。請求指敎。﹁農村回得去嗎。﹂要解答這問題。我們應得問淸楚﹁爲什麽要回農村去。﹂認淸問題的本質。然後才不致所答非所問。然後才能給予比較正確的答案。照雄聲君的本意。因爲在都市中﹁受着最時髦的病症丨失業。感到找事毫無把握一的苦痛。於是發生了一個問題。﹁能不能回農村去。得到一種最適當又最可能的維持生活的方法。﹂我們由此知道要回到農村的雄聲君。和離開農村的農民的原因一樣。是爲了無情的現實生活所逼迫。驅使。並不是由於﹁愛好﹂或不﹁愛好﹂鄉村。農民之離開淸潔的誠實的生活自由的（？）土田。並不是由於﹁不能堅决任勞在鄉村中尋生活。﹂反之。而是堅决任勞在鄉村中尋生活也踏破芒鞋無覓處。我們從都市人口日見過剩可見農民離村率的逐漸增加。而進口主要糧食之逐年劇增。更可見中國農村經濟日趨没落。農村中的情華經了數千百年的層剥削。隨着紳豪官吏來到都市（尤其上海）而流入銀行（尤其外行）。這樣。中國的農村已成爲空虚的她窖。其中　　久已掠奪凈盡。我們要都市中失業者跑到這地窖中找出路。能找到什麽呢。記者先生的話是正確的。﹁跑到鄉村去想解决生活。只有依然餓着肚皮做個鄉村失業者。﹂就謀生而言。回到農村不過是一條死路。雄聲君無疑的是祗有失望。再說起尤懷臯君的鄉村敎育救國論。這是另外一個題目。雖然他想藉此解决雄聲君的問題。但是并未中肯繁。因爲他的設計。第一步就要雄聲君在稅友處至少借到百元做本錢。可是雄聲君明明白白說他是個﹁十足無産者。﹂我想假使他能够一次﹁至少借到百元。﹂他至少也可以向這些親友靠帮。想點辦法。留在都市中。而不至於﹁望洋興歎。毫無辦法。﹂想回到鄉村去了。看見馬路邊的乞丐。駡他太懶惰太不振氣。爲什麽不弄幾個錢來做小本生意。也好逐什一之利自食其力。這是多麽直截了當的說法。我們退一步說。尤先生能够替雄聲先生﹁設計﹂借到這批本錢了。這批本錢就能够一本萬利維持一個人的三四年的生活嗎。就能夠養活﹁在上的老母。在下的妻小﹂嗎。不錯。尤君有的是設計。他要略收每節一元的學費。他要每年每一兒童納一鷄一鴨或三十鷄子於學校。這是破落農村中每個農民家庭供給得起的麽。尤先生可曾知道在每個農村中有多少農民終年身邊未藏過﹁一元。﹂有多少農家連飼鷄或鴨的糧食也没有。而逼得將鷄鴨及其卵子賤價出售以換得暫時的一飽。有幾家能拿剩餘財富來給你城市失業者﹁穿中山裝﹂﹁穿布袍。﹂養活你這﹁鶴立鷄羣的領袖﹂來﹁鄉村敎育救國。﹂幻想終於被現實所打破了。至於尤君想拿銀行放欵做﹁十分鞏固﹂的基礎。這更是幻想。銀行的資本是爲着利潤而流動的。假使可以做你的事業基礎。他丨銀行家丨爲什麽不自己去﹁絶對主張並實行努力鄉村敎育救國。﹂照我們最近的經騐。才曉得銀行放欵要拿大批農産物作抵押。要找鄉村紳富作保證。要週年一分以上的利息。並且到期不還要變賣抵押品。並且要多餘没收。不足補償。而且一個城市失業靑年有何保證向銀行借錢。卽使多方設法借到了錢。你不過帮助銀行在做再度剥削農民的工作。在做促成農村經濟加速度崩潰的工作。你將等不到﹁三四年後學生長成大人﹂時。而眼見你的東家及你的學生丨﹁未來的信徒。﹂顛沛流離。展轉溝壑。離開你的﹁幻影﹂一萬八千丈。尤君不但是對於鄉村敎育很有研究。藉﹁意想﹂以廻避現實的空想主義大家。雄聲君。記者先生讀者諸君。請你們給予公正的批判。總之。由雄聲君的動機。農村是回去不得。照尤先生的﹁意想。﹂回農村也是此路不通。當然農村自有牠的歷史命運。並不因什麽人來繁榮牠與否而離開牠的進化必經的種種階段。同時雄聲的苦悶正是他同時代的兄弟們共同苦悶。假使他没有一點生存勇氣。而老是﹁犯法没膽量自殺没勇氣﹂這般懦弱。唯一的出路怕祗有活活餓死一條大路吧。我們很詫異。在這時代一個靑年爲什麽不能正面向着社會的共同敵人去鬥爭。而反屈伏一隅。幻想救星的降臨。或坐以待斃。</p>

<p>天津勝在地利人才合作三端</p>
<p>傑漢生德飛周賢言最爲出色</p>
<p>今日上海戰天津中華聯合隊</p>
<p>（天津十五日電）天津上海之埠際足球賽、今日下午三時在英國球塲舉行、結果天津以七比一大勝、雙方精神甚佳、觀衆興味濃厚、</p>
<h3 id="c189">上法時四比一 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>十分鐘連失二球　上塲五分鐘、津隊天舉進攻、左翼活動殊力、極妙聯絡之下、結果上海之門先破、不數分鐘、津隊又從中路進攻、一衝再中、十分鐘内、上海連失二球、</p>
<p>十二碼鐵門又陷　上海連告失守、</p>
<p>於是小心作戰、形勢稍和、然而上海轉瞬又被判罰十二碼、卒成三比零、津隊左内大將傑漢生、數年前馳譽海上、獨得一球、孤軍衝入、遠射而中、美妙非凡、</p>
<p>上海隊方開紀錄　至此上海以四比零大敗、距上半時將完畢前之數分鐘、上海努力反攻、得一角球、方才中的而開上海之紀錄、上半時比數、天津四、上海一、</p>
<h3 id="c190">下半時三比零 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>反攻不成再失實　休息後繼續作戰、上海大爲振作、迭次反攻、俱未成就、而天津則一得機會、又逼臨城下、在門前混戰之中、天津又中第五球、</p>
<p>美妙傳遞第六球　勝負形勢、似已告定、作戰局勢、形成各個行動之趨勢、天津之進攻亦緩、迨將完局、天津在無意中、經過幾次美妙之傳球、又得中第六球、</p>
<p>傑漢生臨了傑作　至此上海雖力圖興奮、奈已成狂瀾難挽、數次力攻、皆不能衝破天津後方之堅壁、末後二分鐘、天津主將傑漢生遠射一不可挽救之球、適在門木之下數寸而進網、造成七比一之結果、</p>

<p>結果雖相差懸殊、上海之表演、至爲可觀、前鋒之中、以德飛最有精彩、周賢言之守門、亦大受稱賞、經其一身挽救不可避免之危險、數在不少、否則更不止此也、失敗原因、當在中衛後衛兩線實力之欠充實耳、天津之得勝、地利熱悉、人才平均、其合作之佳妙、尤非上海所及、今日上海與天津華人聯合隊比賽、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>廣州市立五十四小學校有三位年僅十四五齡的小學生，爲着遼吉黑熱四省相繼淪亡，毅然决然的要去從軍殺敵。事前，在家長面前，只說學校童子宿營，須三日乃返。待到數日以後，學校方面及各生家長，均接到小朋友的來信，聲明已往投十九路軍準備北上殺敵去也！小朋友是誰？羅渭泉，黄炎興，董悅康，都是粤港富商的子弟。學校方面接到的書信，已披露在粤港各報：</p>
<p>夫子大人尊鑒，三省淪亡，熱河失陷，凡具熱心男兒，皆應救國；而學良等棄地而逃，生等鑒此，當盡匹夫之責，於是投軍而殺敵焉。從此分别，來世再晤，臨書悲忿，不盡所言！學生羅渭泉黄炎興董悅康同上。</p>
<p>有人見了這封信，賞識他們文字淸順，確是個可造之才；他們旣是富商子弟，儘可以努力科學，研究航空，將來一有機會，從事於救國殺敵，當然有相當的成績，比着現在去充當那未成年的小軍人，不是好得多多麽？我說：這話，固然不錯，但，熱血高湧的童子，說救國，便救國，大有﹁斯　已矣，何待來年﹂的感想。萬不能把成人審愼的思想，去批評一般救國童子。我對於他們的救國决心，雖是可惜他們的年齡太小，但，說得到做得到，而且，幹了才說，不是說了不幹，這便是王陽明先生知行合一的雛型。比着近來的投機軍人尅日殺敵的電報，雪片也似的飛馳，待到後來，只是一跑了事，唉！讀了小朋友的書信，能無愧死？</p>
<p>兒童節後，有了這三位投筆從戎的小朋友，確是替兒童節增高了許多價值。</p>

<p>我們從花柳醫生門口走過，常常瞧見一種觸目驚心的廣告：一個美麗的女人頭，下身忽然變作了可怕的毒蛇，糾纏在一位靑年的身上，似膠如漆，緊緊地纏着不放。我們要是掩遮着那美人的下半截蛇身，一定說是天上的安琪兒，人間的尤物；倘不揭來一瞧，是山海經裏所說的蛇身人面的怪物，那這般親暱纏綿的情形，恐怕柳下惠見了也要動心，魯男子見了也要﹁性的衝動﹂呢。</p>
<p>我們在街頭，又往往可以見到這種現象：馬路上打架的朋友，一定都有羽黨，在打架的時候，也許裝做﹁和事老﹂，熱腸高義，把魯仲連自任。可是遇着了機會，便學了拳敎師的方法，口裏只顧說：﹁都是自家人，有話好說，何必動手﹂。豈知老實不客氣，來幾下冷拳，只自己暗地裏明白，偏袒究竟在那一邊。最滑稽的，打了人家幾拳，還一邊按着自已的臂膀，哎唷唷連聲的呌痛，說是被人家打傷了。這是社會上常有的事，算不來甚麽滑稽。</p>
<p>日本人的拿手好戲，鬼蜮伎倆，不是很像上述兩事嗎？他們很明白我們中國人的弱點，丨也是惡劣根性丨掠奪了東三省熱河以後，便放出許多空氣，來淆惑人心；甚麽直接交涉，甚麽軍事協定。甚至於提倡中日携手，維持亞東和平；中日重敦舊好，避免世界第二次大戰；這不是像打了人家幾拳，還說是﹁不打不成相識﹂的麽？這不是像女拆白施展誘惑的手段，實行其敲詐的伎倆麽？我們千萬别聽日本人的花言巧語，當心他們雖然人面，下面是蛇身呢！</p>
<p>日本政府的外交，完全採取妓女的﹁誘惑政策﹂，猶如在戰爭時候用的﹁烟幕彈﹂一般。這樣﹁誘惑政策﹂，麻醉了我們健忘性的中國人，委實比烟幕彈，還要厲害，可怕不可怕！我勸苟安旦夕，惰性健忘的同胞，千萬别上日本人的當呀！我因爲我們中國人對於某一件事情的發生，莫不熱閙異常，十分起勁。譬如負指導國民的報紙，其先也很起勁，用特號字來做標題，後來徐徐兒淡了下來，用頭號字了；久之，淡焉若忘，找遍了這份報紙，竟不見隻字的記載了！唉！到了現在，便有這種現象麽？在下實不敢說！</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>舊銅爛鐵，蠧書蛀畫。一登了古董之肆，便身價萬倍；一到了舊貨攤上，便不值分文。實在拆穿了講，同是舊東西；同是擱置貨。稱了古董價值連城；變了舊貨，不值一　。這分别在那裏？實在莫明其妙！</p>
<p>古骨肆裏光顧者：碧眼金髮的洋人；大腹便便的富商：下野的政客武人；自命孤忠的遺老。他們看中了一件東西，出了成千累萬的代價，拿回去摩沙鑑賞，什襲珍藏，這件舊東西便交運了。</p>
<p>舊貨攤上的老主顧：囚首垢面的　三；縮肩蜷背的老槍；衣衫襤褸的小販和苦力：他們成交的生意，大都是幾個銅</p>
<p>子，要是化了幾毛錢，眞是了不得的事情。這件東西拿回去，要是他一有了錢，早把他丢在垃圾桶中去，還肯愛惜它，收藏它嗎！</p>
<p>咳！過時的貨色，交了運成古董，不交運成舊貨。物猶如此，何况乎人，你看功業煊赫，靑史留名，這是人中的古董；懷才不遇，老死牖下，那便是人中的舊貨。成則爲王，敗則爲寇。古董和舊貨的分别，想必便在這裏。</p>
<p>便是我們做文人的，也逃不掉這個例子。有的一編問世，紙貴洛陽；有的東塗西抹，終歸字簏。說甚麽嘔心絞腦，說甚麽推敲斟酌，只要你自問是古董還是舊貨？要是古董，自有人向你拜求。要是舊貨，那便哭倒在文昌帝君和至聖先師以及倉聖老人座前，也没有功效。</p>
<p>咳！古董和舊貨，眞呌人起了萬種疑慮；也增了不少凄慘！</p>

<p>皮包，不是旅行到歐美去的大皮箱，亦不是家裏放衣服的板箱，是學生當書包用的十四寸長的皮製書包，當你走過學生散聚中心的西門，你可以看到許多提皮包的人，尤其是早晨上學的時候，或午後四時後散學時的中華路上，三五成羣，男的長袍西裝褲，女的短褲長旗袍，除大襟上别着一枚三角形或長方形的彩色的校徽外，手拿的就是我所說的皮包了。</p>
<p>有幾個初來上海的鄉下老，看見了，他們對他的同伴說：﹁怎麽有這許多年靑的外國醫生？﹂</p>
<p>皮包的蓋上面，用漆寫着幾個花體的英文字、原來是皮包主人的尊姓大名，所以這樣倒可省男女學生交際通報姓名的麻煩和幾位少爺小姐們求愛偷查姓名的忙碌。</p>
<p>更其是一輩年級稍低的女學生，讀的書都是國文，黨義，歷史，地理······等的薄薄的幾本紙面書，没有金字皮面洋裝厚書的點綴，爲了時髦心切，那大洋三元一隻的皮包，不得不惠顧了。</p>

<h3 id="c212">幾種玩物 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 朱戮</p>
<p>前奏</p>
<p>我不敢說我國的家庭敎育，是怎樣的不善；但因着家庭對於兒女們的玩物，太不注意的緣故，於是兒童們的智識，那中發白一臺，淸一色三番麻將術，却比任何學問，部來得精明普及！麻將，可以習練心算，原不是壞的玩物，不過那頑麻將的人却把來做金錢的賭具，有些人更卜畫卜夜，沉涵不起。這不良的影響，灌施到兒童們純潔的腦中，却是益少而害多。所以兒童們的玩物，必須於麻將之外，另行設法。下面幾種，雖是普通的玩物，但有的可以運動身體，有的可以增加智慧，並且價值旣廉，自製亦易，任何家庭中的兒童，都能享用。現在特地寫出來，供獻給親愛的小朋友。</p>
<p>鍵子和扯鈴</p>
<p>在這般的年頭，我們不能不準備着怎樣去對付那﹁最惡劣的環境的到來﹂鍛鍊體魄，確是最需要的課程了。所以那種可以運動　魄的﹁乒乓球﹂﹁網球﹂等，都是兒童們的有益的游戲。但家庭中最簡單而有補於身體的玩物，却要推毽子和扯鈴了。毽子的製法，十分簡易：用一個大鋼錢，用布鏠着，在上面縫個雞毛管；縫好之後，在那管裏插三根或四根雄雞的尾羽，毽子就製成了。（有的用紙來做，製法亦十分簡單）。毽子的玩法，大都用脚踼的，除了最普通的右脚踢外，有合盤，（兩脚對踼）拐，　，箭，跳，等等各種式樣。那活潑的跳躍，不但可以練習脚勁，四肢百骸，也莫不隨着全體活動哩。扯鈴，有單頭和雙頭兩種，市上都有出售，價目也很低廉。那扯鈴玩起來，不但可以運動週身筋骨，並且還能發着悅耳的鈴聲；玩熟之後，也能抛上擲下的做出新鮮花樣來。</p>
<p>七巧板與益智圖</p>
<p>增進智慧的玩物，除了積木和棋子以外，七巧板和益智圖，確也是小朋友恩物了。七巧版的構造：共有大三角兩塊，小三角兩塊，中三角一圖巧七（）一圖智益（二）（義勇軍）</p>
<p>塊，和斜形銳角與方塊兩塊；大大小小，共計七塊，所以呌﹁七巧版﹂（七巧板和關於他的書籍，商務書館内有出售。七巧板自製亦易，取正方的紅木，或玻璃，硬版紙亦行，平面硬物，對角劃開，稍加手續，丨見圖丨卽成。）就可拼成各種器皿和人物的形式了。益智圖的構造，比較複雜些，計共有大小不同的尖斜方圓的板數，十五塊（見圖二）所以把它來拼成器皿人物，也覺玲瓏而像眞。現在我把一些關於益智圖拼成的東西，畫在上面。小朋友們，不妨也倣着創造幾個式樣出來，定可感到興味無盡呢！</p>

<h3 id="c213">﹁囚犯的性慾問題﹂有感 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 祝秀俠</p>
<p>自從張博士提倡性學以來，天下騷動，現在此老已由﹁性﹂歸﹁農﹂，彷彿性風已熄，也就不甚有人提倡﹁性﹂的問題了。但近幾天報上又有某立法委員先生提出囚犯的性的問題，究竟大雅之音，不絶如縷，頗使我肅然起敬！</p>
<p>委員先生對於地獄的一羣，别的不大去想，而專着眼於性慾，是之謂獨窺其隠，澤及下懷，照例，也是屬於皇恩浩蕩之類的。</p>
<p>不過，别的事情，我不大懂，提到牢獄，我却曾稍窺門徑，據我所知：牢裏的罪人們，並不感到什麽性的苦悶，反之，飢寒的壓迫，死的窒息，却是領受着的，因爲所有的牢獄，甚至以﹁模範﹂作標榜者，囚犯每天所吃的祇有二十四兩榖，秕，砂，石，混雜的糙米飯，兩箸腥臭的樹根菜，所住的祇是一間霉濕的小房間，（不到七尺見方的﹁號子﹂，要住上二三個人）冬天僥倖能夠發下來的舗蓋，是一張蛛網似的舊破毯，夏天在汗氣交攻，臭味剌鼻的號子裏，像蒸籠裏的饅頭一樣，在這種活地獄裏面生活的人們，不消一年半載，便弄成半生不死的，營養旣不充分，又缺乏空氣與運動，大人先生們所埀念到的性慾問題，可以說簡直是無關重要的。</p>
<p>然而，這也難怪，大人先生們出必汽車，吃必大菜，住必洋房，在這樣飽暖生活之際，女人，自然是認爲唯一重要的。從前有一位皇帝問飢民一何不食肉糜？﹂大人先生注意到囚犯的性慾，當不是怎樣無理的事。况且，﹁根據法律，﹂﹁仿傚歐西﹂，言之成文，談而有稽，自屬可行之舉，可惜，不知道是中國人的身體壞些，還是另有其他原因，這意見我總覺得有點像開頑笑。</p>
<p>雖然是，﹁食色性也﹂，聖人有言，但非飽暖如大人先生者，性慾問題，似非必要的，假如讓犯人有一時自由之機會，則犯罪者與不犯罪者所要要求的﹁自由﹂正多，不必單單把皇恩放縱在女人身上，至於說到﹁無後爲大﹂，這還不了，中國的人口正患過多，而這些叛徒養的，大槪還是些小叛徒，將來使﹁内﹂不安無以攘﹁外﹂，就至少要﹁剿﹂他幾下，更是自尋煩惱了。</p>
<p>因此，還是請那位委員先生取消這意見的好，我想，犯人們對於這樣的恩典，倒是滿不在乎的。</p>
<h3 id="c214">﹁光棍哭妻﹂與﹁荒山淚﹂ <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 得中</p>
<p>我記得一件小事，是從人家嘴裏聽來的，但是直到昨天，没有找得證明，所以一向没有再從我的嘴裏轉述給别人聽過。</p>
<p>那是滿淸大臣和外國代表初次開會時的事情，外國人都﹁咿咿唔唔﹂的唱着他們自己的國歌，我們滿淸的大臣唱什麽呢？大家站起來，商議了好久，便唱了一段小曲，大約是呌﹁光棍哭妻﹂吧！凄凄切切，閙得黄毛鬼子莫明其妙！</p>
<p>我當時聽了這事，認爲不可能。滿淸政府縱然腐敗，官吏縱然胡塗，總也不至如此。</p>
<p>現在，我們的藝術明星程硯秋，﹁自費﹂的從法國考察藝術完了歸國，在他對記者的談話中，這樣說過：</p>
<p>予在德法，均未公演戲劇，······僅去年七月國際新敎育會議開幕時，照例在每一國代表演說前，須演奏國歌。我國代表演說前，即由予淸唱﹁荒山涙﹂一段，旣無胡琴，又乏鼓板，乾唱一曲，爲予生平所未有之事也。</p>
<p>於是不由我不相信，﹁荒山涙﹂旣可代表﹁國歌﹂，﹁光棍哭妻﹂當然也可代表﹁國歌﹂了。</p>
<p>但是注意點在這裏，﹁荒山涙﹂是什麽？是一個以禮記檀弓篇﹁苛政猛於虎﹂爲藍本的二簧戲，公公丈夫全死，剩下一個小寡婦，悲悲慘慘，凄凄切切的落﹁涙。﹂這個小寡婦，便是程老板的拿手角色。當然嘍，這樣﹁拿手好戲﹂，唱來﹁旣無胡琴，又無鼓板，乾唱一曲﹂，是如何的屈尊了程老板的大才！</p>
<p>以前是哭妻，現在是哭夫，倒也前後媲美，只可惜黄毛洋鬼子是一樣的莫明其妙！</p>
<h3 id="c215">白玉堂之死 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>近讀﹁三俠五義﹂及其續集，看見許多中國人的道德觀與傳統思想，很淸楚地表現在這些書裏，而無疑地這些陳腐的道德思想是支配了數百年來的中國的讀者大衆。其中最顯著的一例是白玉堂之死。</p>
<p>像寫作﹁三俠五義﹂這類書籍的作者的思想，可以很簡單地用幾個字就說明了的，他們所一致讚頌的是﹁忠孝節義﹂，他們所恨之入骨的是﹁姦盜邪淫﹂，而同時在他們故事中所要表現的是﹁報應循環，天理不爽﹂這八個大字。而且對於他們，人類的終極的報應是死亡，特别是﹁横死﹂。</p>
<p>所以凡是俠義之人結果都是封了官，光耀了門庭，而且必定有了很善良的子嗣。那些爲非作惡的賊徒，不是被捕正法，也必是死於亂刀之下。但在白玉堂的這個場合，是一個獨特的例子。</p>
<p>白玉堂者外號人稱錦毛鼠，是書中最重要的人物五鼠之一，而且因爲他的個性的顯著（這類書中的人物大多數是没有個性的），倒是一個極生動而可愛的人物。他的個性是怎樣的呢，據作者說是﹁心高氣傲﹂，像這種脾氣，如今看來也算不了什麽的，但是對於那樣傳統思想的作者，一個人處世毫不圓滑，事事不讓人，事事不服人，這還了得，應當給他一個報應，所以白玉堂雖是義士，也就不得不死了。</p>
<p>白玉堂三探冲霄樓，死在亂箭之下，屍首﹁猶如剌蝟一般﹂，眞是慘不忍睹。如果這死根據着白玉堂的性格來解說，未始不可以動人，而使讀者更覺得吻合一些，但作者不然，他終歸要抬出報應循環的大道理來，藉着死者自己的盟兄蔣平的口中，說出這樣的話來：</p>
<p>﹁說起咱五弟實在可憐：這也是他素日陰毒刻苦，所以遭此慘亡。﹂</p>
<p>除去白玉堂之死，另外還有兩三個俠客義士之死，也是傳達着這些作者的同樣的思想。在﹁續小五義﹂的卷四第七十九回，有兩個封官不久的義士也遭了横死，一個是韓良，外號人稱過雲鵰；一個是熊威，外號人稱玉面貓；他們因爲到藏珍樓裏替皇上盜回失掉的衣冠，而遭到慘死。他們死的原由也是藉着書中的人物口裏說出來的。</p>

<p>﹁徐良問：﹁怎麽是報應？﹂</p>
<p>﹁智爺說：﹁你們那裏知道。他們三個人在夾峯山上爲寨主，熊威携眷在山上，韓良就爲有女眷出外不便，他硬把一個玉皇閣玉皇爺的聖像敎嘍卒搬出去，扔在山澗裏頭了。這玉皇閣就算一個後寨，敎婦人居住。到後來熊威回來，他就應當不從者才是；他又不肯傷了弟兄們情面。内中有朋玉他再三的不敎把玉皇閣作爲後寨，這二人一定不聽。到次日魏道爺來到之時，已經這玉皇閣改爲後寨；道爺也無法，就冲着後面念了三聲無量佛。你們看這報應眞切不眞切？熊威，韓良，朋玉三個人，是生死之交，怎麽凈是熊威韓良，想那朋玉他上那里去了？他要來也就死在這里了。可想人總得心好，神佛不得不敬。﹂</p>

<p>（十九）戴東原之哲學</p>
<p>胡適博士於中國近三百年之思想家獨尊戴震，嘗著﹁戴東原的哲學﹂一書，由商務印書館出版，又作﹁幾個反理學的思想家﹂一文·收入胡適文存三集。文中謂戴氏爲科學家，長於算學，精於考據，故其治學方法最爲精密，其哲學爲有科學精神之哲學。至於戴氏何以有此思想？何以有此哲學？胡博士尚欠說明。胡博士嘗作新生活一文，敎人凡事須間﹁爲什麽﹂，並謂﹁人同畜生的分别就在這個﹁爲什麽﹂上。﹂不知胡博士於講戴東原哲學時，何以竟自忘其﹁爲什麽﹂之敎訓也。﹁太炎演說錄﹂，於戴東原何以反理學，頗有說明，讀罷爲之一快，兹錄於此：</p>
<p>東原先生他雖專講儒敎，却是不服宋儒，常說﹁法律殺人，還是可救；理學殺人，便無可救。﹂因這位東原先生在滿洲雍正之末，那滿洲雍正所作硃批上諭，責備臣下，並不用法律的說話，總說﹁你的天良何在？你自已問心可以無愧的麽？﹂只這幾句宋儒理學的話，就可以任意殺人。世人總說雍正待人最爲酷虐，却不曉是理學助成的。因此那個東原先生痛哭流涕，做了一本小小册子（按指孟子字義疏證一書）。他的書上並没有明駡滿洲，但看見他這本書，没有不深恨滿洲。</p>
<p>吾將以此遙寄好問﹁爲什麽﹂之胡博士，並問戴東原先生爲何欲反理學也。至太炎先生之言有無根據，亦願有考據癖又有歷史癖如胡適博士者，有以語我來也。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁那我去呌人來修好麽？﹂</p>
<p>海泉自獻慇勤的企起身來了。</p>
<p>﹁不可去了。有人呌去。﹂</p>
<p>她微笑着伸出手來阻住他。</p>
<p>﹁誰呌去了？﹂</p>
<p>﹁諸先生。他剛才來看阿曹。我煩勞他呌去了。﹂</p>
<p>海泉常常聽見秋英提起姓諸的話來說，這免不得引起了他對於他們的懷疑。因此，他好一會没有話說，只是坐着痴想。</p>
<p>﹁林先生，你在想什麽事？﹂</p>
<p>﹁没有什麽。﹂</p>
<p>他又直覺着她已經是猜透了他的心事。</p>
<p>天色更加黑下來了。他已經看不淸楚她的臉部的輪廓了。他因爲有了上半天的經騐，此刻再凑近她的臉邊去，但同時暗咒自已的卑鄙。秋英只是笑了一笑，一無抵抗地給了他一個接吻。他感覺着她的動作似乎没有上半天那樣的熱烈，她的精神像很疲倦。他才離開她，就聽見外面樓梯上有足步音。</p>
<p>﹁諸伯伯麽？﹂</p>
<p>她的淸脆的聲音。</p>
<p>﹁是囉。﹂</p>
<p>外面的鈍濁的聲音。</p>
<p>海泉看見一位靑年引着一個電氣工人走進房裏來了。但他看不淸楚他們的面龐。</p>
<p>﹁林先生，你替我抱抱這個。······﹂</p>
<p>海泉剛把小孩子接過來，便聞着一股尿臭。他看見秋英走近那位姓諸的身傍，拉了一拉他的手，便一同走出外面去了。他倆的態度更加引起了海泉的猜疑。</p>
<p>不一會，電光亮了，抱在海泉懷中的小孩子也哭起來了。秋英和那位姓諸的靑年又一同回到房裏來了。海泉留心看他的樣子，他比海泉矮胖一點，身軀也似比海泉結實，粉白的面龐，一接眼看去，的確像一位美男子。但眼睛細小，認眞看去，身材似乎臃腫了一點，完全像一隻小白象。</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3 id="c241">再談中國的病根何在？（上） <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>上期漫談裏曾說到中國的病根所在，乃由於全國最大多數人的没有飯吃，以及日趨於餓死而亡國的境界。雖說没有飯吃，本是今日列强各大小國家的共有的病象（聞蘇俄無失業國民，理應除外，非敢恭維赤化的友邦，事實如此耳），但東北熱河，先後被人佔領，强隣已升堂入室，而全國一部分民衆與政府大多數領袖猶怨天尤人，上下交爭利也如故，大有至死而猶不知奮起自救的趨勢，這種毫無民族意識性的怪病象，則爲我們中國所獨有，如此種病象的所以然不弄淸楚，我們就永不能自拔於死亡之中。</p>
<p>我們以爲這種特殊病象的造成歸納起來，可說是由於以下的兩種原因：</p>
<p>（一）維繫民族意識性的各種制度的破産；</p>
<p>（二）維繫民族獨立性的文化日趨於消失。</p>
<p>我們知道一個民族的獨立偉大，全靠有維繫這民族團結性的各種政治的，社會的，或宗敎的制度存在。某一種制度，即或爲守舊的，不合乎政治或經濟潮流的，但祗要運用得法，能繼續改進不已，則就無傷於民族的獨立偉大。比如猶太人的生存，印度民族的奮鬥，就全靠他們宗敎制度的維繫力量。英國的政治制度，雖仍有皇帝的名義存在，但無傷於他民治精神的發展。此外如意大利的獨裁制度與最近德國的政變，雖然有許多學者根據民治主義或社會主義的立塲，批評他們是如何落伍或開倒車，但牠總不失爲一種代表民族意識性的獨立制度。倘若這種制度是將有害於民族發展的，則又自會有新的制度醖釀起來取而代之，並無傷於民族的獨立偉大。回顧我們中國的現狀是怎樣呢？現有的（仿效别人的）政治制度，則空有其名，毫無實際的精神，經濟制度則外受資本帝國主義的侵略，内受政治混亂的影響，於是原有的維繫民族經濟的農村制度，手工業制度，以及稍有維繫民族意識性的家族制度，均日漸消失而趨於破産途徑，此外如宗敎的制度，在中國則本無特殊勢力，所以我們覺得造成中國目前特殊病象的第一個原因，是由於制度的破産。好的制度，合乎潮流的制度没有，壞的制度，落伍的制度也没有。比如滿淸時代專制政體，其爲落伍的制度，要被時代的齒輪所輾軋毁滅，自爲鐵一般的事實，無可否認的，不過，專制制度雖壞到如滿淸的那樣糟，但其制度本身所有的一點嚴肅的紀律，却未盡失。你看水師提督丁汝昌在中日戰爭一役的喪師失地以後，他還能知道責任所在的大法，猶能毅然自殺，以代國刑，以謝國人，而事實上亦正因爲他如不自殺，也不能免於死耳。單就這一點而論，就可說是制度的本身，没有完全破産的表示。而今日却不然了，失地數省的負責者，依然能在巨公要人歡送聲中優游海外，政府旣無意懲戒，民衆更無力制裁，於是整個政治，社會制度的破産，可謂暴露無遺。</p>
<p>我們知道一種民族精神的發揚與其求生存的奮鬥能力，全須憑藉着一種制度的領導而前進，没有制度就要失其運用的效能，民族奮鬥的自信心，就會逐漸的消失。我們很痛心的感覺得中華民族的現狀，實很有日近於這一類的趨勢。關於造成中國今日特殊病象的第二種原因，因篇幅的關係，且留待下期漫談中討論之。</p>

<h3 id="c242">洗冠生怎樣會成功 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 家祥</p>
<p>我們站在現世界的觀點上來看，洗冠生以學徒出身，而能有現在的地位，總算是一個成功者，這成功雖是客觀環境所造成，但他自身的奮鬥精神，却也值得我們分析和研究的。</p>
<p>他初來上海當學徒是遠在二十五年以前，到現在他已是三十萬資本的冠生園老板了。要研究他成功的原因，不外乎以下幾點：</p>
<p>一，與失敗奮鬥：在他前創業的過程中，共有兩次失敗，第一次在南市，第二次在南京路，創食品肆，都歸倒店，中間所經過的艱難困苦，眞是難以形容；然第三次組冠生園食品公司時，資本雖僅數百元，但他能一改以前的誇大精神，而以脚踏實地，從小處着手爲營業方針，終得成功，這﹁從小處着手﹂的經騐，可說是從兩次失敗中得來的敎訓。　　二，進社會大學：洗冠生曾在一處講演，說到他的學習精神，他說他也進過大學，可不是什麽國立或公立的，是社會大學。他曾到過北平，也到過南京。每到一處，就拿各地的食品來研究，並分析各地方人的口味，製造出適合他們需要的食品來，因而北平，南京就是他的大學。從這點看來，一方面固然證明他的學習與研究的精神，另一方面，却也證明他的成功，是根據着社會需要的。</p>
<p>三，平等待店員：這在洗冠生的成功上，也很有關係的。他對待所有店中的職員，不但很和氣，而且平等，不但平等，而且對店員加以敎育。因爲這樣，所以冠生園的店員，才能帮他成功，促成他成功。同時他得來的多量利潤，也不是全裝上自己的腰包，而是分很多給店員的。</p>
<p>像洗冠生這樣人，的確是學徒們店員們的好模範，他的勤學，不畏難，以及有飯大家吃的精神，確爲一般人所不能做到的，同時他自奉也很簡樸，一身的老布袍，布鞋等，保其未成功前的常態，這確是一般人所難學到，所難做到的一件事！</p>

<p>— 顧桂秋</p>
<p>女鹽販</p>
<p>百户村是住着十數家人家的一個村莊，藏在一個山谷的中間。百户村附近的人有句俗語：﹁小小百户村，娘子養男人；娘子挑鹽賣，男人正在鬥纸牌。﹂這幾句話反映着女子並不是没有能力的。</p>
<p>眞的，百户村的女子身體是强健的，筋肉是堅固的；走起路來並不弱於男了：她們不論老的，小的，都能夠挑上一擔五六十斤的白鹽：她們向來靠着這種買鹽生活的。</p>

<p>她們這樣的生活並不覺得痛苦。因爲她們早上挑了鹽出去，到晚上賣完了。鹽回來，把所賺的錢買些米，魚，和她們的丈夫，兒子吃一個飽。</p>
<p>可是近年來她們的生活，並不如往昔的愉快了。因爲她們挑了鹽在街上走，或者在鄉村的大道上走，嘴裏喊着：﹁鹽要嗎？﹂的時候，往往給水警抓住打了一頓，還把鹽拿去。甚至把她們拘到牢子裏！這樣，家裏的丈夫和兒子就整整地餓了一夜。</p>
<p>她們現在有一種消極的反抗辦法去對付水警：她們每每幾個人挑着鹽聯合在一起，走向街上，或者路上；遇到了水警，她們就不客氣的用她們粗的拳頭，硬的扁擔，把水警打得要死；報復了以前的受打。</p>
<p>她們還能作婦女運動。她們聯合了百户村全體婦女，和附近買鹽的婦女，到縣政府去請願，要求取消捕鹽的陋規。她們的理由是這樣：</p>
<p>﹁鹽是本地出産的，本地出産的鹽，連本地的人都不能享受嗎？﹂</p>
<p>但是縣政府的答覆是：﹁鹽是公有的，所以要像鴉片般的公賣的。﹂</p>
<h3 id="c245">專著勞働者失業的原因 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 松夫</p>
<p>失業問題的形成，是資本主義社會組織形態下的一個特徵。　封建制度的手工業時代，雖偶有特殊反常事件的發生，足以影響人民的職業生計者，但不過是少數的一部分人，而没有别種相互關聯的。迨資本主義發達，多數無産者不得不放棄其舊業，從鄉村各地羣集於城市裏的大工廠，成爲工銀勞働者。一個大工廠發生事故，足以影響到許多勞働者底失業，而失業的結果，不用說，就是失業的勞働者本身的悲慘。這樣，勞働者的失業問題纔成爲現社會的重要問題。所以，促成失業問題最大的原由，根本的還是現社會組織的畸形，不合理。資本主義愈是發達，失業的人數也愈有可驚的增加。觀於各資本主義國家的職業介紹所及請求工會津貼者之登記人數之多，便可想而知了。</p>
<p>日本北澤新次郎把失業的社會原因分爲：（一）勞働需要的季節變動，（二）産業界循環的頽靡，（三）臨時日工制的存在，及（四）因技術及組織的進步而起的生産過剩的變化，四項。這種分類是較爲普遍而且適合的。現在，我且把這四項失業的社會原因略加說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）勞働需要的季節的變動　大部分的職業的盛衰繁閑的程度之差異，是受時間性的支配的。勞働者的需要的等差，更視産業的季節不同而發生勞働者的不足或多餘的狀態。在某種産業繁盛之時，該項職業的勞働者的工作生活自無問題：若該項産業因氣候的不同，社會的流行，時代的趨向等原因而發生衰落時，其勞働者工作便感覺到缺乏而有失業的事情發生。各種産業有時間性的居多，故這項原因影響於失業問題很大。其中尤以熟練勞働者爲甚，因熟練勞働者限於某種所熟練的工作；他種職業則非所長的緣故。</p>
<p>（二）産業界的循環的頽靡　在過去的經濟史上，很明顯可以看出經濟社會時相衰落興旺的循環的痕跡。市塲受社會的，經濟的，地理的，風俗的，諸原因的支配，常有衰落及興旺的現象：且此現象有時不僅是發生於一部分空間，而且是有相互關聯足以牽連全局的力量，如前數年我國紗廠之紛紛倒閉，便是一例。在經濟社會的市塲一旦衰落時，勞働者的失業情形是很可怕的。</p>
<p>（三）臨時日工制的存在　臨時日工的工人，也可說是已失業的人，得到暫時的工作，也是不常的偶然的事，因爲各工廠需要工人的塲所，自有足用的長時間的契約工人，需用臨時日工工人的地方很少。這種工人没有固定的長期的職業，大部分鵠候於各工廠，公司，車站，碼頭等附近，等待有人來僱用上海黄浦江畔的碼頭小工，便成這類工人的一部。</p>
<p>（四）因技術及組織的進步而起的生産過剩的變化機械的發明，生産方法和生産制度的進步，可以使生産的消耗減少，和生産品的增加。於是勞働者的過多，及其熟練的技能，都成爲不需要，而一部分的勞働者遂不得不遭失業的慘刦了。</p>

<p>— 心</p>
<p>親愛的讀者們：在現在，許多和你們同樣身份的人，在有暇的時候，不是翻着報紙，找些强姦等類的新聞來看，就是和旁人談着關於女人的一切。而你們，却能利用暇時來閱讀本刊，這是我非常欣佩的。</p>
<p>當你們看到本刊的﹁自我職業介紹欄﹂常是客滿，號稱黄金國家的美國，失業工人也有幾百萬；而在另一方面，在地球上佔六分之一的國家丨蘇聯，非但没有一個失業的人，反而需要大批的工人去工作等的新聞，你們心裏或許會奇怪這一切的現象，然而你們却不能解答這些現象是怎樣會發生的。你們之中，有的雖然在學校裏念過書的，但先生並不會告訴你們一切社會現象之所以發生的原因；没有進過學校的，自然更不容說了。而你們的老板或師兄們呢？對於這些社會現象，能正確地解答的，怕是很少的；有的簡直不知道那是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>現在且讓我來介紹一本﹁怎樣研究新社會科學﹂（柯柏年編，南强書局出版，每册三角五分）。這本書，雖然不能立刻就告訴你上述一切社會現象之所以發生的原因；但它會告訴你一些研究社會現象的方法。看完了這本書之後，再依這書後面所開列的書目，逐漸選讀研究，這樣，不僅可得到上述一切社會現象之所以發生的　案　就　其他的社會問題，也會得到解答了，同時，也就是你們的學識大大的充實了。還有本﹁社會科學槪論﹂（楊劍秀編，現代書局出版，每册四角）這本書，有些地方雖然不大正確，但由它可以知道社會的意義是什麽，它的結構是如何的，以及政治，法律，宗敎，道德，藝術是怎樣發生的。</p>
<p>再呢，你們在有空閒的時候，除了讀報紙以外，大槪是看﹁啼笑姻緣﹂或﹁荒江女俠﹂之類的小說，可是看了這些小說書以後，你們有些什麽感想呢？大槪不是幻想着自己成爲一個多情公子，就是成爲一個和書中一樣的十八般武器嗎？當着日本以及一切帝主義樍極瓜分中國的時候，這種小說，祇會使人沉醉在那種幻想中，而實際上是來消滅大衆抗日反帝的力量的。現在所需要看的小說應該是適合當前情勢的，所以，我希望諸位去看﹁義勇軍﹂﹁子夜﹂﹁士敏土﹂﹁鐵流﹂﹁潰滅﹂﹁布羅斯基﹂等的含有深刻意義的小說書。</p>
<p>附語：如果在看書的時候，遇到了很多的新名詞，如﹁資本主義﹂﹁社會主義﹂﹁唯物史觀﹂等，則可翻閱﹁新術語辭典﹂！本報流通圖書館裏大槪有的吧！</p>

<p>固然，在更深夜靜，輾轉床褥時，不絶的想；就是日裏，一面在工作，一面亦不能不爲以後的問題設想。因爲社會上的怪現象，麵包不是在那兒等你去拿的，更不能夢想牠能湊到你的嘴上來，你必定要尖銳了頭用全副精神去奪才行。然而你就用盡精力又有何用？一般人早捷足先得了！一般人借了他人的手接在自己的手上而取得了！一般人靠了别人的力量而得　小現在像我這樣怯　的人要想用雙拳兩脚在這怪現象的社會上去和人爭麵包，豈非同﹁病人和力士比武﹂一樣的可笑而又可憐嗎？有時一想，還不如自殺吧，但﹁自殺是怯懦的行爲，是不能奮鬭的庸人﹂，﹁天生我才必有用﹂，···等等的思想，又盤據於我腦中。因爲我自信雖非﹁十全十能﹂的靑年，不過我有高超的意志，必能有一番的作爲。怯懦？庸人？我豈甘心受之。天生我才必有用！然而我的處境又如此，究竟又有什麽用處呢？這些，這些思潮，像澎湃的驚濤駭浪般的在我腦海中起伏打擊不已！</p>

<h3 id="c253">我對於TheSignlftheCross的管見 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>我相信，無論耶穌敎徒或非耶穌敎徒，凡是看過TheSignoftheCloss的人們一定會感受着極深刻的印象。雖然帶着很濃厚的宗敎色彩，但以影劇藝術而論，這部影片可以說是大導演家西席地密爾的傑作，也是好幾年來電影劇界不可多得的佳片。</p>
<p>我嘗自問何以千餘年來耶穌敎在歐美各國的勢力如此偉大，何以科學昌明的歐美人民信仰宗敎的虔誠如此歷久不衰。史學家說，西洋文明是耶穌敎義與希臘學術兩種要素融化而成的。西席地密爾的TheSignoftheCross影片把這要旨盡量的發揮了。</p>
<p>宗敎本來是個人的事情，也是社會人生的一部。西席地密爾的影片以宗敎爲立塲，同其他影片以戀愛或罪犯等等爲立塲，在電影藝術上，都没有甚麽多大關係。我們以這觀點出發批評TheSignlftheCross，西席地密爾描寫當時歐洲文化史上非宗敎與宗敎的衡突十分深刻。羅馬當時是代表所謂ThePaganWorld的最雄厚的勢力。羅馬的偉大和野變遇着耶穌博愛精神的侵入，在rbeSigoftheCross影片的劇情裏面襯托穿揷得十分驚動。一羣男女老幼耶穌敎徒不爲威武所屈，唱着頌聖歌悲壯的從容就義，赫赫不可一世的羅馬總督，羅馬皇后屢次誘惑不成，最後却給平民的耶穌敎少女征服，雙雙把臂殉道，隠伏後來羅馬以至全部歐洲爲耶敎勢力所征服的線索。</p>
<p>總括的講，TheSignofheCross是一部透澈描寫上古西方文明轉變時代丨個重要關鍵的歷史影片。至於其他特點，我因個人的觀點或主義不同，容或有不能盡如人意的地方，已經有人批評過，而我的意思不過在把我個人所見到西席地密爾導演這部影片的主旨指出。我對於這部影片的譯名也認爲十分不當。</p>
<p>編者註：凌鶴君和思蘋君二評，一係出於非基督敎徒的；一則係出於基督敎徒的，但俱有深切的見地。還有一點相同的，就是他們都認這種影片的譯名不妥。不過﹁羅宫春色﹂四字，亦有牠的好處；最明顯的就是一種掩蓋過重的宗敎色彩的企圖，以避免我們一般pagan或竟是Atheistic民衆的非議。或者這種企圖，尚有其他成就的塗徑，所以我想請凌鶴，思蘋二君：試擬一二較爲莊嚴，合乎片情的譯名，投諸本刊。倘適當者，當與發表，惟此點絶不作公開討論。不敏</p>

<p>— 忠</p>
<p>昨天南京的換片，雖然以卓别麟和密茜格琳兩位明星相號召，其實牠和一個短片大會差不多，一共是五部影片，成績很好，分誌於后：</p>
<p>第一是百代新聞Special（特殊貢獻）内中多半是運動和空軍方面，有不少飛機排列的畫面，非常偉麗，在提倡航空救國的我們，很能得到一部份的興奮。　　其次是馬萊羣島風土片，雖然不長，但是頗有趣味，可以演出熱帶人生活的一斑。攝影極藝術化，很像上流的風景畫，不似尋常風土片的單純。</p>
<p>再次是一部卡通滑稽片（炭畫）没什麽可說的。</p>
<p>﹁賽珍會預告片﹂和休息以後，就是﹁柳絮飄零﹂LittleOrphanAnnie了。</p>
<p>牠的故事極短，說一個小女郎，父親遠出經商，她爲了帮助一個孤兒院中的孤兒，設法使他被一個老婦携去，她又到老婦家中，陪孤兒去玩，孤兒不幸受了傷，她又看護他。聖誕之夜，她參加孤兒院的慶祝會，她發現扮聖誕老人的，是她遠道歸來的老父，於是得到骨肉團圓了。</p>
<p>這是美國一個日報上，長篇漫畫的材料，編劇和組織上很好。主角是密茜格琳MitziGreen她在表演上，自然的流露出天眞和滑稽。最精彩的是她陪孤兒玩的時候，她化裝成﹁馬克司弟兄﹂，MarxgBrotoers在﹁皆大歡喜﹂裏的滑稽表演。她又扮一個頑固的老婦，描刻入微，她的模倣天才，恐怕是没有人能否認的吧？飾孤兒的勃斯脫范爾潑Busterpbelps，僅有五六歲的年齡，而表情已很可觀了，一哭一笑，都能博得人們的同情。</p>
<p>其餘的童角也還好，成人的配角只好算陪襯着作戰。</p>
<p>佈景不錯。光線有地方太暗了一點。攝影極好，如孤兒由樓上跌下一幕觀衆中的小孩，有同情而笑的。没有什麽穿揷，全片有呌人大笑的滑稽，有使人焦急的緊張，如是成績，是夠得上稱一聲﹁優等作品﹂的。</p>
<p>這片子的Ending緊接着便是﹁巡捕，﹂EasyStreet的Beginning，這是卓别麟五六年前的舊作大約因爲卓氏兩年來，没有作品，觀衆渴念已久，所以雷電華公司把牠翻一下，新配上良美的音樂，以應需要吧？</p>
<p>滑種片故事是空虚的，牠寫卓氏身任巡捕，幸而智敗一位大力士，于是受了人們的崇仰，三本影片中，僅此而已　　導演一無可談。光線，攝影，佈片，化裝等等的簡陋幼稚，不在今日國景之下。但是牠雖幼稚，而前後呼應，對照，都很不錯（光線等不好，一半也因爲舊片翻版的原故。）卓氏那種八字脚冷雋的滑稽態度，我也五六年不曾看見了，（他從﹁淘金記，﹂﹁尋兒夢，﹂以至于﹁城市之光，﹂他已改變了作風了。）而且我疑惑這張影片，也許是十年前作品，（但是不能一定說）反正這張影片，雖然不合理，有漏洞，硬滑稽，但終非俗不可耐，天才藝術家，終能發揚他的天才啊！</p>
<p>五張影片中，以﹁柳絮飄零﹂最長，也最好。﹁巡捕﹂一片雖然音樂極好，但是比較中。在今日環境下，　只　平平之作而已。</p>

<p>﹁黎明﹂亦已攝竣</p>
<p>最近天一公司因攝影塲附近之空地，已開闢馬路。轔轔之聲，往來不絶，對於收音極有妨碍，故將實行遷　的計劃。日前邵醉翁已與裘芑香到閘北寶山路底林家花園勘察過。該處地處僻靜，人烟稀少，雖爲拍有聲電影良好塲所，唯路途過遠，或將另覓他處。故目下尚未能决定也。</p>
<p>小妹妹黎明暉的第二部戲，劇本已定名爲﹁黎明﹂，適與她的姓名相同，劇本乃該父黎錦暉所編，劇旨是採取現實的題材，爲勞苦的大衆，作痛苦的呐喊，同時：暴露了有産階級的壓迫與剥削的手段，連日　芑香在黎氏家中討論劇本的分幕與攝製的意見問題，聞約在本月二十日左右可開始拍攝云。</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>﹁羅宫春色﹂雖然已經開映了四天，但是牠的偉大，牠的成功，的確有再談一次的價值。</p>
<p>如果我們讀到古代歐洲史，看那描寫羅馬帝國的一部份，誰能不爲之感慨？看到文藝復興的基督徒十字軍，誰又能不受着感動？但是那些正史絶没有裨史或電影之魄力偉大，没有牠感人之深眞的，導演西席地密爾的偉大，也是不能否認的。﹁十誡﹂或﹁萬王之王﹂﹁禁果﹂ForbiddenFrujt以及﹁黨人魂﹂VolgaBoatman那一部不是光榮的？這次的SjgnoftbeCross更建樹了地密爾最高的地位。其實與其說這是歷史片，還不如說是宗敎片，與其說是宗敎片，勿寗說、是倫理片。牠有極深刻的章義，有極優美的技巧，把喜怒哀樂，溶於一爐，將藝術，思想，倫理娱樂，打成一片。那是多麽難能的事？這片子是派拉蒙公司空前未有的成績，以技巧一項而論；牠已超過﹁大飯店﹂。</p>
<p>其實故事上，也有相當的遺憾，但是經過了導演的努力，牠絲毫不影響於全片的尊嚴或偉大。在這種偉大導演之下，其他一切技術上，也造成新的紀錄。那佈景的偉大，光線的神潔，呌人贊美欽佩。</p>
<p>他故作驚人之筆，突如其來的似與前一幕不相銜接，但是在次一幕，牠立刻用一個傳神的穿擂，將牠們連貫起來，天衣無縫。攝影上，絶不用新奇角度，然而配合的結果，非常﹁美化﹂而結實。</p>
<p>演員方面，五個主角，三個是﹁費德立區馬許，伊麗莎蘭地，克勞黛柯爾柏﹂，我們早都認識的天才演員，還有兩位却利賴甫頓和維恩端平CharlesLaugbtongVivianTopin却是新進明星，也都異常優美。美國包士頓日報（BostonDailyNews）評牠說；﹁······這是超過任何鉅片的一張鉅片，世界上任何人都能欣賞丨部應當領略牠的······﹂的確不是過獎之詞。</p>

<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>出人意料以外的事情，是常常有的，奥洛夫的失寵於喀德璘，正和妲拉喀挪華公主的被騙於奥洛夫一樣！因爲當奥洛夫被派往騙妲拉喀挪華公主的時候，喀德璘耐不住宫中的孤寂，另外愛上了一個少年英俊的皇族。這時候喀德璘心目中的奥洛夫，祇是一個順從的臣子，而不是一個可愛的一刻也不能離的人兒。</p>
<p>妲拉喀挪華公主就像犯了重罪的囚徒一樣，前呼後擁的被綁到宫裏；但她心中很是坦然，她想：﹁你是一個謀丈夫的淫婦，我是伊麗莎白皇后的女兒，我爲什麽要怕你！﹂</p>
<p>喀德璘在盛怒之下原是要把她斬首的，直至看到她那副倔强的神態，曉得她只是一個天眞爛漫，胸無城府的女兒，這樣一個人，似乎没有什麽陰謀，她一定是上了人家的當，於是喀德璘便對她說：﹁倘使你肯除去妲拉喀挪華公主的名位，再不作非分的妄想，我是可以放你的。﹂</p>
<p>﹁什麽呀，你要我死都可以，祗是不能褫去我拉喀挪華公主的名位。﹂她說着，張大了那兩個圓大的眼珠，從那眼珠裏射出一道慾火，好像這宫裏矞皇富麗的陳設，雄偉莊嚴的侍衛，都要聽她妲拉喀挪華公主的指揮一般。</p>
<p>喀德璘下令把她繫在獄中，褫去她的衣服，露出她那雪白肌肉，用一根粗的鞭子，在那皮膚上一記一記的抽着。她嬌啼，她宛轉，她掙扎，她憤怒，她想像一般歷史上成大事的人物，一定要遭受一些磨折，她祗有忍着痛，想着她那可愛而又可恨的奥洛夫。</p>
<p>奥洛夫，在良心上的讉責與神經上的剌激兩重壓迫下使他對於妲拉喀挪華公主感覺萬分的慚愧與痛惜，他想：﹁去自殺吧，但自殺了，她仍舊受着硬笞的威脅，度着悲慘的生活；况且除了我自己以外，還有誰能去救她。﹂奥洛夫想到這裏，便又仍去覲見喀德璘，她好像有幾天不見他，而仍舊有些留戀，再看奥洛夫的容貌與聲音，仍是和從前一般地動人，她不覺恢復以有對於他的熱情，奥洛夫掩着内心的痛苦，陪着喀德璘作樂，而暗地裏哩，因爲他已經恢復喀德璘的寵幸，同時也恢復了他固有的聲威，他便假了喀德璘的命令，去把那做　公主夢的妲拉喀挪華釋放出來，（未完）</p>

<p>Our Troops Consolidate Positions Along the Luan River</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Formations Bomb Lulong County Viciously</p>
<p>Critical Situation at Nandasi, North Beidaihe</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the eastern front of the Luan River, the enemy's main force of over ten thousand troops is now moving south from Lengkou, Jianchangying, and Qian'an. Fighting is currently taking place between Qian'an and Lulong. Enemy traces were discovered yesterday in Xiaojieying, a few miles northwest of Lulong, and in various villages over ten miles north of Xiaojieying. The enemy's artillery bombardment against us is extremely fierce, and the sound of artillery fire is clearly audible in Luanxian. Hostilities broke out as we fought for the Luan River Bridge west of Lulong, resulting in confused fighting. We are still in a stalemate as of this morning. Shang Zhen's troops are now deployed from Kaiping to the west bank of the Luan River to prevent the enemy from advancing westward. The area between Luanxian and Lulong is defended by He Zhuguo's troops. The center of the fighting in eastern Luan is in the vicinity of Lulong. The war news from various key passes along the Great Wall, such as Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Jielingkou, and Chenglingkou, has been silent yesterday and today. Our troops are separately reorganizing their units and redeploying their positions. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, enemy troops suddenly appeared outside the west gate of Lulong at the Sorghum Stalk Bridge, confronting Shang's troops for a long time. This morning, our troops are still firmly defending north of Lulong, while completing the deployment of defenses on both the left and right banks of the Luan River. Certain units east of the Luan River have also been ordered to assemble near the Luan River. Local bandits harassed Liushouying and Niutouya last night, and the residents fled completely. The various units in eastern Luan are currently redeploying to consolidate the Luan River defenses. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 6:20 AM on the 15th, six Japanese aircraft flew to Qinhuangdao and dropped eight bombs on the North Train Station area and China Street. The No. 8 train to Beining departed ahead of schedule due to the enemy aircraft's arrival, but the train windows were shattered by the enemy bombs. Refugees crowded vehicles heading west from Qinhuangdao, wailing and crying. Villages in front of Qinhuangdao have mostly been looted by local bandits. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) An incident occurred at Nandasi, east of Beidaihe, at 4 PM on the 15th. Most of the troops near Liushouying gathered towards [illegible]. Three trains of reinforcements passed through Tianjin eastward on the 15th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) After the fall of Lengkou, the situation in eastern Luan changed. At present, the situation on both banks of the Luan River is consolidated and there is no danger. A unit is still on alert in the Qinhuangdao and Haiyang areas. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) This morning, five enemy aircraft, covering over three hundred infantry and cavalry troops, attacked the Tujialing position of our cavalry unit in the Haiyang area. They were fiercely repelled by us. Around 10 AM, the enemy continued to send three armored vehicles and approximately five to six hundred infantry troops to attack Wangjialing. By noon, our troops were in a stalemate with the enemy at Fenghuangdian. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) This morning, twelve enemy aircraft bombed the areas of Nandasi and Beidaihe train stations and strafed the armored vehicles at Beidaihe Station. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) At noon on the 15th, the cavalry guarding north of Beidaihe encountered the enemy advancing from the Pingyu Avenue. The battle was very fierce. The enemy artillery fired at the Beidaihe-Beining railway line. Several shells landed at Nandasi Station, but did not hit vital targets. The enemy's invasion of Qian'an caused great panic among the people of eastern Luan. The Beining train has not been cut off, and the westbound passenger trains are extremely crowded. Luanzhou is calm. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) According to a telephone call from Lulong on the 14th, enemies who invaded from the Liujiakou area north of the county crossed the river at Sangyuan. After being repelled by the cavalry of the [illegible] unit, a large group came again. Our troops are fighting hard. At noon, seven enemy aircraft in formation bombed the county seat, dropping countless bombs and strafing the streets with machine guns, which was inhumane. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the movement of troops in the Lengkou area, our army on the eastern route, fearing pressure from the enemy, has gradually been holding its new positions along the Luan River since yesterday. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Our Troops Firmly Defend Lulong County <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone call from Lulong, at 2 AM this morning, over three hundred enemy cavalry charged to Dahengheji outside the city, about ten miles from the city, and engaged in fierce fighting with a certain unit of our army. The artillery fire was very intense for a while, and the city was also hit by artillery shells. After a fierce attack by our army, the enemy cavalry was repelled. Our troops are firmly defending Dayingwo. Lulong County is still being closely guarded by our army. This morning, there was still fierce fighting outside the city. At dawn, three enemy aircraft bombed the city again, causing minor damage. The enemy has concentrated its main force at Jianchangying and began a fierce attack on our army this morning, intending to force our army to retreat from the Pingyu Avenue and seize the Beining railway line on the eastern route in one fell swoop. Our eastern route also had minor skirmishes yesterday. The enemy is harassing our positions from time to time, intending to threaten our army to retreat. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Military news: On the night of the 9th, Shang's troops at Lengkou, under pressure from superior enemy forces and intense bombing by numerous enemy aircraft, retreated southward after fighting fiercely for three days and nights, suffering heavy casualties. They originally intended to occupy the highlands south of Jianchangying and continue the war of resistance. However, they were surrounded by enemy troops who invaded from the Liujiakou and Baiyanglü areas, forcing them to continue retreating to the south bank of the Luan River. Qian'an County, being surrounded by enemies on all sides and isolated west of the river, is extremely difficult to defend militarily. It was temporarily abandoned in order to concentrate forces for a counterattack. Although Shang's troops suffered heavy casualties this time, they are still actively reorganizing to prepare for a counterattack. Our eastern Luan troops are also being redeployed.

<p>Lengkou: Since the 10th, the battle on the Lengkou front has been extremely fierce. The Chinese army, based on its solid positions, resisted stubbornly, resulting in an unprecedentedly fierce battle. In particular, the brave actions of the Miyazaki unit were a testament to the Great Wall front. The Miyazaki unit arrived at the Great Wall wall in Liuhegou on the 10th. As the Chinese army retreated, they blocked the gate of the Great Wall with stones, completely sealing it off. After nightfall, the Miyazaki unit used a dozen soldiers to form a human ladder, attempting to scale the Great Wall. When they reached the final point, they were bombed with grenades by the Chinese army, causing the human ladder to be tragically killed and collapse. But they continued relentlessly. After the front ladder collapsed, it was replaced by soldiers. Finally, they succeeded in scaling the Great Wall. As a result, the Miyazaki unit sacrificed as many as twenty-three soldiers.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military plans to expel the Chinese army from the [illegible] River area, then seize the Beining Railway by force, and demand that the countries signatory to the Boxer Protocol recognize it. The Japanese would then be entirely responsible for the security along the Beining Railway, and Japanese goods could increase their sales in North China, gradually transferring the interests of Britain and the United States in North China into Japanese hands. The Fushun coal mines would be dumped into the North China markets, replacing the Kailuan coal mines. Recently, the Japanese naval commander sent to the puppet government has proposed opening a military port in Mengludao and adding river defense teams to the Heilongjiang and Songhua Rivers, which has far-reaching implications.

West of Sahe Bridge, our army had long prepared new positions, and the defenses were extremely solid. The situation at Xifengkou seemed to have gone unnoticed due to the intensity of the fighting in Luanyangcheng in the middle. The military authorities had long had predetermined military plans for that area. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Causes and Effects of Rural Decline <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Our country's rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, which is an urgent issue. The floods of the year before last devastated the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, threatening the survival of the people. Last year's bumper harvest, according to common sense, should have alleviated the people's hardship. However, what actually happened was that we fell into the old trap of "cheap grain hurts farmers." Not only are farmers in poor provinces finding it difficult to maintain their daily lives, but even the supposedly wealthy provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are in dire straits. After the floods of the year before last, self-cultivating farmers of the middle and lower classes relied on borrowing to maintain their lives. Although there was a bumper harvest last year, grain prices plummeted, with the average value of each stone of rice being no more than two yuan and eighty cents. Even after deducting the cost of labor, fertilizer, land tax, and levies, there was barely enough. How could they repay the debts incurred from the natural disasters of the year before last?</p>
<p>The import of foreign rice, wheat, and flour in 1932 totaled 206 million Haikwan taels, with foreign rice ranking first. This situation is becoming increasingly serious and represents the biggest crisis in our country's national economy in recent years. Initially, the government did not prepare countermeasures, and the people were indifferent. This year, however, the crisis has become increasingly apparent. Rural areas are collapsing, and this has clearly affected cities. Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing and even Guangzhou are showing signs of economic decline. Imports and exports cannot maintain a balance of payments. Coupled with the deepening of the global economic panic, silver prices have fallen even lower. Our society in general is showing even more signs of decay. If we look at other countries in the world, they are also groaning under the impact of this panic. Small farmers in the United States owe between 12 billion and 15 billion US dollars. Rural debt in Germany is also more than 11 billion marks. Rural debt in Japan is no less than 7 billion yen. Our country has a vast area and lacks accurate statistics, but judging from the general situation, the heavy burden on farmers must be even more severe than in the countries mentioned above.</p>
<p>Last year was said to be a good harvest, according to the business report of the Bank of China. Rice production increased by about 30 percent. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics investigated eight rice-producing provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Guangxi, and found that they produced more than 572,297,700 dan of rice and more than 175 million dan of wheat. It would seem that people should not worry about food shortages, and the state should have ample resources. Why are foreign rice and wheat still flowing in, and why are disasters continuing to occur? For example, in Hanzhong, there was a bumper harvest, but the price of wheat fell to half of what it was in early spring last year. However, the counties north and south of the Wei River in Guanzhong had nowhere to find food. Again, in the vicinity of Wuyuan, grain was in abundance, but Tianjin and Beijing were importing foreign flour. The problem is that transportation is inconvenient. Even at the destination, human obstacles and harsh taxes make it impossible for agricultural products to leave their place of origin. Our country's rural areas originally idealized a self-sufficient society. Since the opening of the sea, the import of capitalist commodities has shattered this ideal with cheap goods. Although rural grain production is still present in regions stuck in the pastoral era, such as Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet, the products of those regions are also becoming commodified. In other words, they are inevitably affected by the global economic crisis to some extent. In addition to human destruction, the Mukden Incident in 1931 caused irreparable losses to farmers in the Northeast, and the relocation of farmers from Shandong and Hebei cut off new avenues for development. Surplus population has nowhere to go. Wuyuan, the granary of the Northwest, has been mismanaged, allowing soldiers and bandits to run rampant, causing farmers in Shanxi and Hebei to hesitate to move forward, leading to the abandonment of cultivated land. Provinces in the hinterland of the Yangtze River basin are suffering from the chaos of mobile bandits. When the bandits leave, the soldiers come, and even chickens and dogs are affected. People are only seeking to escape death. Even in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where order is relatively better, the ridiculously low grain prices have led to mounting debts, making it difficult to continue operations. In addition, the sharp drop in raw silk and the cessation of tea sales have made it difficult to find supplementary income. The lives of farmers are almost at an end. As for why Fujian and Guangdong are relatively wealthy, it is only because they rely on remittances from overseas Chinese. Now that the markets in Southeast Asia are deteriorating and the economic panic in the United States is deepening, there is no way to remedy this. How can Guangdong maintain its former prosperity? The rural areas of our semi-colonial country are increasingly filled with pessimistic materials and are beyond imagination.</p>
<p>The way to save ourselves in the future cannot be limited to promoting peasant education, rural autonomy, implementing Baojia, and maintaining order. Such programs might have been effective 30 years ago. It is difficult to achieve a small, well-off society in a short period of time. Now, times have changed. At the very least, we should circulate the rural economy, abolish usury, and rotate rural finance, so that agricultural products do not stagnate, in order to alleviate the current crisis. The fundamental solution lies in the land problem. Only when the land problem has a correct answer can the country's long-term plan be established.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Japan-Manchu agreement on the Manchurian electric communication business, which was negotiated by Ambassador Mutō and the (puppet) "Manchukuo Foreign Minister," was formally signed on March 26th of this year and announced simultaneously in Tokyo and Changchun at 4 p.m. on the 15th. The content is as follows: Electric communication business is the nervous system of a country, which is not only of great importance, but also has an important role in the development of culture and economy. However, the Manchurian electric communication business, which is operated by the Japanese side in the Kwantung Prefecture and the South Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area, and the electric communication business operated by "Manchukuo" within the territory of "Manchukuo," means that two communication businesses are opposed to each other in the same area, so there are many regrets in the connection, and there are also disadvantages of double investment of capital, which also leads to useless competition, which is a great hindrance to the development of the business of "Manchukuo." The governments of Japan and Manchu recognized the necessity of merging all electric communication facilities in Manchu of the two countries, and on March 26, Showa 8, the Japanese representative Ambassador Mutō and the "Manchukuo" representative Xie "Foreign Minister" signed and sealed the agreement, stipulating that the electric communication facilities of Japan in the Kwantung Prefecture and the South Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area and the electric communication facilities owned by "Manchukuo" should be merged, and civilian capital should be added to form a Japan-Manchu joint communication company.

<p>(Moscow) The Izvestia newspaper published today an important telegram from its reporter in Chita, stating that according to Japanese sources, the "Manchukuo" authorities have decided to seize the Sino-Eastern Railway. To prepare the grounds for the seizure, the "Manchukuo" authorities have been creating various pretexts to provoke a conflict, such as illegally demanding the return of locomotives that do not belong to the Sino-Eastern Railway, and vehicles that were scattered in Soviet territory due to the obstruction of traffic at both ends of the Sino-Eastern Railway during the Sino-Japanese War, forcibly stopping Sino-Eastern Railway transportation, and detaining Soviet citizens, etc. According to the reporter's sources, these provocative acts are still considered insufficient, and there are plans to destroy bridges and water kiosks in the future, which may occur at any time between late April and May 1. (15th TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The fare of the Sino-Eastern Railway is very high because Russia aims to benefit itself and plans to develop the Ussuri Railway and Vladivostok.

At the same time, the import of locomotives and freight cars into Russian territory is also the same as the western line and is no longer possible. (15th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>Those Who Love the League of Nations Should Not Avoid Difficulties</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Problem Should Be Resolved in Accordance with the League Covenant</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Party member Churchill recently gave a speech in which he said that the League of Nations had made a big mistake by interfering in the Sino-Japanese dispute. When Lord Lytton spoke in Reading, he refuted Churchill's remarks. Lord Lytton said, "I have read Churchill's advice to the League of Nations not to interfere in the Sino-Japanese dispute. Churchill claims that he respects the League of Nations, supports the League of Nations, and sincerely hopes that the League of Nations will succeed, so he does not want to see the League of Nations being dragged into the Sino-Japanese problem. This kind of view is really strange in the eyes of friends of the League of Nations. I am afraid that Churchill is gradually becoming senile. I have known Churchill for a long time, and I have never seen him shrink back from difficulties. He has dealt with difficult undertakings in various political parties in Britain." (The audience laughed, because Churchill has repeatedly changed parties.) "I have never known Churchill to advise his friends to escape from difficulties, but I did not expect that Churchill is now advising the League of Nations to abandon difficulties out of love for the League of Nations. In fact, the only solution we can seek for the Sino-Japanese problem is not to escape from difficulties, but to deal with difficulties in accordance with the League of Nations covenant. We must support any solution agreed upon by the League of Nations." (Reuters News Agency)</p>

<p>Police in All Districts Conduct a Four-Sided Roundup</p>
<p>Two Policemen Die, Two Thieves Are Captured</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:30 p.m. on the 15th, Wang Rongji Construction Factory in Dafengfu Lane, Xinjiekou, received 7,497 yuan in construction fees for building school buildings for the Engineering and Artillery Schools. All of the money was in Central Bank notes. They immediately used the telephone to notify various material factories to come and collect the material fees. While they were calculating the accounts, four thieves broke in one after another, using a pistol to cut the telephone line and scaring Wang Qifa and the men and women in the house, forbidding them to make any noise. All of the 7,497 yuan that had been received was robbed, and then they fled together. At this time, the police on duty at the Shigulu Sub-Bureau of the Fifth Police Bureau heard the news, urgently sounded the police whistle, and gathered police to pursue the thieves. Led by Police Chief Chen Zhengeng, more than 20 policemen followed and chased the thieves. One policeman chased the thieves to the front of the Anti-Opium Commission. Because his gun malfunctioned, he was resisted by the thieves and shot to death. The remaining policemen bravely advanced. Subsequently, the police on duty at the First Bureau on Zhongshan Road sounded the police whistle to conduct a roundup. Another policeman was shot to death by the thieves, and one policeman was injured. At this time, police teams from all districts gathered and captured two thieves on the spot. One was Wu Jiayou, 26 years old, from Hefei, who was carrying a Brownie pistol. The other was Zhou Peiwen, 25 years old, from Huaicheng. They were escorted to the Fifth Bureau by Chen Wensheng, a patrol officer from the Shigulu Sub-Bureau, and then transferred to the police station for interrogation. The policeman who was shot to death in front of the Anti-Opium Commission was Cao Deshan, a petitioner policeman from the Shigulu Sub-Bureau of the Fifth Bureau, from Suqian. One policeman who died was Wang Wenyu, a policeman from the Yangpixiang Sub-Bureau of the First Bureau, from Hebei Province, who was shot in the chest. He was rushed to the hospital by streetcar, but died on the way to Daxinggong. The injured policeman's name is Wu Wanhai, also from Hebei Province. He was shot twice by the thieves, one shot entering his left arm and one bullet entering his lungs. He was immediately taken to the Second Hospital of the Central Hospital for treatment. According to the person in charge of the police, four robbers have been arrested in this case, two policemen have been shot dead by the robbers, and two policemen have been injured. More than 1,700 yuan in cash was found on one robber. After the incident, Police Chief Chen Zhuo personally went to the scene to investigate. Chen advocated giving preferential treatment and rewards to the policemen who died in the line of duty and were injured. The police station will interrogate the arrested robbers overnight in order to pursue the remaining accomplices. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury Woodin Opposes Inflationary Currency and Devaluation of Gold Prices</p>
<p>New York Bank Exports a Batch of Gold to the Netherlands</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 14th - Sources close to the government tonight claim that Treasury Secretary Woodin will oppose printing more money or devaluing the US dollar under any circumstances. Most financiers believe this means that President Roosevelt will also hold the same view. The inflationary currency faction in Congress will temporarily cease activities, at least until after the World Economic Conference. The rapid advance of the movement to devalue the gold dollar in Congress and the rapid decline of the US dollar in foreign markets reached a point on Thursday where action had to be taken. Therefore, the government approved the export of a batch of gold by a New York bank to the Netherlands for rescue. Now, members of Congress and financial experts believe that the US president will also make a clear statement on the issue of inflationary currency in the coming days.</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 14th - After the US dollar experienced a depreciation in foreign exchange markets unseen for many years, the Federal Reserve today announced that a New York bank had obtained a license to ship gold to the Netherlands. However, the amount of gold and the name of the bank were not disclosed. It is said that this move by the authorities is to avoid further depreciation of the US dollar in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Although today is a holiday, many financiers still went to their offices to read the latest reports, and many claimed that they anticipated the gold embargo would be lifted soon, or at least a part of it. Because the value of the US dollar must be strongly maintained in the coming days, even a small amount of gold shipped abroad will be enough to curb the dollar's depreciation. Considering the recent situation in the financial sector, it may be possible to allow several more batches of gold to be shipped out. Therefore, the financial community is paying attention to the US president's actions to prevent further depreciation of the dollar. The activities of the silver and inflationary currency factions in the US Congress, and the news that the Canadian Prime Minister will discuss the possibility of resetting the value of gold in the world with the US President, have greatly impacted the dollar. Therefore, observers here believe that unless the gold embargo is largely lifted, the only option is to allow the dollar to depreciate further. Economists generally believe that if the US President can take immediate action to curb the dollar's depreciation, it can be regarded as an expression of his attitude towards inflationary currency. Since taking office, the US President has not made any other statements regarding currency, except to state the need for a suitable supply of stable currency.</p>
<p>As for the Federal Reserve Bank's gold reserve report, it increased by $8,700,000 yesterday. In the week ending on the 12th, it had already increased by $8,397,000. The reason for both increases was due to the decrease in the amount in foreign gold accounts, and the import of gold from China, Latin America, Australia, and other countries. China imported $102,000, Australia imported $267,000, and Latin American countries imported a total of $31,000. Therefore, under these circumstances, the gold embargo seems to be eased somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Moscow Court Continues Trial of British Engineers <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Judge Deems MacDonald's Confession Valid</p>
<p>Russian Manager Says the Case is Fabricated</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 14th - The British engineers case opened for its third day of hearing today. Although MacDonald recanted his confession and pleaded not guilty, the judge deemed his original confession valid. A key point of the day was whether the 3,000 rubles given by Thornton to Russian engineer Mrs. Durgov was a loan or a bribe. Durgov claimed that she regarded this amount as an improper gift, so she turned it over to the authorities, and she had a clear conscience. Although Ms. Durgov believed this, her frank answers made a good impression. Thornton claimed that it was a loan, but he did not issue a receipt because Ms. Durgov said that a receipt was not necessary. The court then questioned MacDonald and Nordwall about their admission of negligence in the indictment. Kortlelevsky, head of the turbine room of the Soviet Sugar Factory, said that at MacDonald's request, he threw a large nail into the generator and damaged the motor, for which MacDonald paid him 1,000 rubles. He also gave MacDonald a drawing of the Soviet Sugar Factory. Other witnesses said that Nordwall instigated them to be negligent, and they followed his instructions. One witness said that Nordwall had given 5,000 rubles. Nordwall was greatly surprised to hear this testimony and immediately declared to the court that all this testimony was false. The court also questioned the sale of leather clothing between Nordwall and a certain witness. Nordwall claimed that the leather clothing belonged to another British engineer, who asked him to sell it to a certain witness, get the cash, and forward it to the owner. Prosecutor Vishinsky heavily criticized Nordwall for the slight discrepancies between his testimony today and the confession he had prepared before the trial. Laitek, the administrative head of the Soviet government, also attended the hearing today.</p>
<p>After a three-hour recess, Nordwall was called to the stand again for questioning. Nordwall's answers were brief and firm, making a very good impression. Allenik, a Russian employee of Vickers, answered the court's questions, saying that Nordwall should be responsible for the improper installation of a certain turbine because Nordwall did not notice the errors in the blueprints. Nordwall immediately argued that he had not seen any errors, and even the expert committee had not discovered them. He had no malicious intent. A Russian named Xue Bait, who testified in court, said that he had never worked for Vickers, but he was friendly with Thornton. Thornton told him that the company's machinery was very sophisticated and that there was no need for excessive inspections. He found defects in the switch, which prevented the work from being carried out quickly, and told Thornton, who thanked him and gave him 300 rubles. Thornton heard this and immediately stood up to deny it, saying that he had given Xue Bait 250 rubles, which was a bonus because Xue's work was good. Xue Bait also claimed that he respected Thornton and believed his words, so he began to be negligent. He also claimed that the British defendant Gregory made anti-Soviet propaganda after arriving in Dnipropetrovsk. Gregory was a British Welshman and a Vickers installation technician. After hearing Xue's testimony, he spoke loudly and vehemently, saying, "This person insults me and ruins my reputation, and the judge listens to him without questioning him. Is this fair?" The judge stopped him, saying, "Speak on the facts, now is not the time for you to speak." Gregory then continued to speak, saying that he went to Dnipropetrovsk to install oil engines, and he worked very carefully in order to maintain the company's reputation. Gregory then turned to the expert committee sitting in a corner of the courtroom and said, "I installed three oil engines, each weighing 45 tons, in 48 days. Please judge whether my work was good."</p>
<p>I do not understand Russian, how can I do propaganda to the workers? I have no time to guide the Russians in their work, and I never pay attention to politics. The last witness was Sokolukin, the deputy chief technician of the Moscow power plant, also one of the defendants, who said that he had received 2,500 rubles from Thornton as a negligence fee. Thornton instructed him to destroy the main power plant during the war in order to sabotage the Russian electrical industry. Thornton and he had jointly agreed on a negligence plan. Thornton immediately denied having had this conversation and denied having bribed him. The trial adjourned at 10 p.m. tonight.</p>
<p>Borodin was also one of those who attended the hearing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 15th - The trial of six British Vickers employees and twelve Russian employees accused of bribery, espionage, and negligence resumed this morning. As soon as the court opened, Monkhouse, the Russian manager of Vickers, stood up and said, "I want to say something. I have been interrogated for 18 hours. I dare to say that this case is fabricated. After hearing Sokolukin's testimony yesterday, I am willing to prove that this case is based on the confessions of Russians who have been threatened." When Mr. Monkhouse said this, the judge hurriedly stopped him from speaking. A group of people who confessed to negligence then came to court to be questioned. Krasheninnikov, chief technician of the Moscow Electric Power Plant, claimed that the Vickers machinery did have defects, but he was instructed not to report them, so he did not report them. Monkhouse interjected and said, "I admit that the machinery did have some defects, but I do not believe that Krasheninnikov was negligent." K replied, "But I believe that I was negligent." Another Russian employee of the Moscow Electric Power Plant, Solin, testified that Thornton gave him 1,000 rubles and asked him to be negligent. Thornton's expression did not change when he heard this. The judge announced today that the trial could be completed tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 14th - British engineer MacDonald initially confessed to his guilt during the trial, then recanted, and most recently confessed again, his position is very confusing. Yesterday, during the recess, the court handed MacDonald over to the Political Detective Bureau for custody. After this, MacDonald's actions changed suddenly. According to a report on the trial situation released by British officialdom, MacDonald's expression was obviously different when he re-entered the courtroom. When the court asked again if he had engaged in espionage, MacDonald replied in a low voice, "Yes, I did," and admitted that he had issued instructions to destroy machinery. However, in any case, according to Soviet Russian law, MacDonald cannot be convicted until all the evidence has been fully examined.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The board of directors of Vickers Electrical Company held a meeting today and unanimously passed a resolution expressing sympathy for the British employees in Russia who are being tried, and expressing confidence in their integrity and loyalty. The board also decided to elect Mr. Richard of the company's Russian business to the board of directors, in order to show the company's trust in Mr. Richard.</p>

<p>Papen and Goering Strive for German-Italian Cooperation in Rome</p>
<p>The Austrian Chancellor is also Said to be Conducting a Movement to Distance Himself from Germany and Get Close to Italy</p>
<p>National Press, Rome, 14th - German Vice-Chancellor Papen and Prussian Prime Minister Goering met with Italian journalists today. Papen said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's peace efforts, as expressed in the Four-Power Pact he proposed, have won the sympathy of the entire German public opinion. Goering said that he and Papen both sincerely hope that Germany and Italy can cooperate closely, and that there are no differences between the two countries that can separate them. Goering has left Italy by plane for Syracuse, Sicily, and is accompanied by Prince Hess, the leader of the German National Socialist Party in Italy.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 15th - Chancellor Dollfuss, speaking to reporters from the Berliner Tageblatt about the Four-Power Pact, said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Prime Minister MacDonald were doing their best to build a new era of peace, and that Austria would always support the avoidance of war, and that it was also necessary to avoid misunderstandings on other issues. Chancellor Du then explained the significance of Italian Prime Minister raising his glass at a banquet in Rome to celebrate the future of an independent Austria, saying that it was to celebrate the future of the Austrian Constitution and its republican system. Du concluded, "From now on, I know that Austria has gained a true ally in the South."</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 15th - Austrian Interior Minister and Deputy Chancellor Winkler issued a statement to the press saying that negotiations on the issue of concluding a preferential tariff agreement with Germany will continue on May 10. Continuing to talk about internal affairs, Winkler criticized the German National Socialist Party's propaganda to boycott Austrian spas. Regarding the issue of creditors of Austria's lending bank, Winkler said that negotiations will continue after Easter. Winkler also stated that the Austrian government has no intention of holding new elections at present, nor will it reorganize the cabinet. As for the 5,000 newly recruited auxiliary police, they will be trained by officers from the federal army. The training period is four weeks, and they will be dismissed after the period expires, and then reconvened when necessary. Winkler also said that the various speculations about Chancellor Dollfuss's previous trip to Rome were completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 14th - Foreign newspapers are quite uneasy about the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty and the reconstruction of the Austro-Hungarian Federation. The Neue Freie Presse here published an article saying, "The Austrians all hope that Austria and Hungary can compromise with each other, but if the restoration plan is put forward, it will inevitably be defeated due to German opposition. Although Italy is friendly to both Austria and Hungary, it will never lose Germany's favor because of this."</p>
<p>Havas, Prague, 15th - Czech newspapers have adopted an extremely reserved attitude towards the recent talks in Rome. It is generally believed that the Italian side wants Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss to expand the scope of the coalition cabinet to include Hitler's party members, and on the one hand wants to make the Berlin government guarantee Austria's independence. The Czech side opposes the German-Austrian union and the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and remains waiting and watching.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th - When the British House of Commons debated foreign affairs yesterday, there were many criticisms of the German government. The German ambassador stationed in London has been instructed by his home government to protest to the British government, and especially opposes former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain's statement that "it is not yet possible to discuss concessions with a country that now considers those who advocate peace or are Jewish to be evil," and Churchill's statement that "if Germany obtains complete military equality, the date of Europe's restoration will not be far off." German political circles are deeply displeased that British Foreign Secretary Simon did not criticize such remarks.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - German newspapers and the government are very angry about the speeches in the British House of Commons on Thursday criticizing Germany. In addition to using the title "Chamberlain and Churchill's Invasive Speeches," the National Socialist Party newspaper did not add any comments. The German General Newspaper called it "an insulting speech," urging the National Socialist Party government to refute such untrue remarks and not forget to pay attention to foreign opinions. The National Sovereignty Party's Posener Zeitung said that it is impossible to find a baser race in the British Empire than this that is more ignorant of the character of the Germans and the true meaning of the German revolution. It also said that Germany has always listened to others' lives, but now it has finally begun to live its own life, and even if it does not suit Chamberlain's intentions, it does not care. The Vossische Zeitung said that the debate in the British House of Commons shows that Britain cannot understand the situation in Germany.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 15th - The Times commented on the speeches made by some members of Parliament against Germany during the House of Commons discussion on foreign policy on Thursday, saying that the sympathy that Germany had aroused in Britain in the past ten or twelve years has been lost in recent weeks. British public opinion believes that it is impossible to directly grant the various demands made by Germany at present, and political figures have expressed their opposition to Germany's demands for treaty revision, and even official figures believe that they are obstructed.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Cuban Terrorist Movement <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Havana dispatch, 14th: The Cuban revolutionary party's terrorist campaign, which began in February, has intensified daily. Today, there were as many as nineteen bombing incidents. This morning, non-official secret agents of the current government seized two youths, drove them in a car to the outskirts, ordered them out, and forced them to run between two rows of armed secret agents. One was then seen to die from serious injuries, and the other also fell to the ground, whereupon they were abandoned. After the bombing incidents occurred, the government warned defense forces everywhere to watch for aircraft attempting to fly in from neighboring islands to bomb. Tonight's news is that the newly restored constitutional guarantees in five provinces will be temporarily lifted again. Recently, in Cuba, bombing incidents, sugar mill arsons, train derailments or bombings, village robberies, or attacks on military forces have occurred almost daily. Because of the strict inspections by the military authorities, newspapers are largely unable to report them.</p>
<p>Reuters, Havana dispatch, 14th: There were no fewer than seventeen bombing incidents today, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. Previously, the police department received an anonymous letter stating that Havana's "Red Week" would begin yesterday, requiring police vigilance. As a result, the police searched everywhere for people with violent tendencies and those suspected of opposing President Machado. They then dispatched cavalry to patrol the streets, and all cars driving in the city were forced to stop at gunpoint and searched. Police arrested dozens of young people, including three students of unknown origin, all of whom were sent to a certain place for detention. Police patrols are now carrying machine guns to prevent further incidents. Today, a bomb exploded not far from the residence of the former Ambassador to the United States, now State Councilor, Ferreira. The bomb was hidden in a fruit vendor's cart, killing a three-year-old child and seriously injuring three others. Police saw a nineteen-year-old youth placing a bomb on a street corner, and when they approached to arrest him, the youth fled but was shot down. His life is feared to be in danger.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Farewell from the Populace in Counties Passed</p>
<p>Student Soldiers Also Accompany the Camp Northward to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The 19th Route Army's troops aiding Jehol, totaling two columns, are divided into [blank] regiments. Artillery, engineering, logistics, and communications troops are all fully equipped. The commander of the First Column, Yan, is currently in Guangzhou, having traveled by sea after the detachment's departure. His unit is commanded by Chief of Staff Li Kuo. They left Longyan on March 27th, entered Guangdong Province at Kan City, Dabu, and arrived at Shiyun District on the 30th, going directly to Fenglang, Tongren, and Sanheba. The populace along the way enthusiastically bid them farewell. Dabu County Magistrate Liang Ruogu personally went to Sanheba to welcome them and prepared four electric boats to transport military supplies to Songkou. All circles in Dabu specially presented four banners, inscribed "Achieve Merit and Subdue the Barbarians," "The Party and the Nation Depend on You," "Restore Our Rivers and Mountains," and "Light of the Nation." They arrived in Songkou on April 1st. Meixian County Magistrate Peng Jingyi first sent a car to Songkou to welcome them. Li Kuo and the unit's personnel arrived in Meicheng at 4 PM on the 1st. The infantry battalion camped at Baiduwei that night and began to arrive gradually on the 2nd. All circles in Meixian held a grand welcoming ceremony and presented goods to reward the troops. The unit rested in Mei for two days and set off for Xingning on the 4th. The regimental commanders were Liu Hanzhong and Xie Dingxin. The firearms of these two regiments were sharp, and the uniforms were neat. The Second Column, commanded by Tan Qixiu, departed from Zhangzhou on March 25th. Tan also first went to Guangzhou by sea to discuss all matters related to the march. His unit was commanded by Chief of Staff Rong. They passed through Shancheng, arrived at Xiaoxi on the 26th, arrived at Xiazai on the 27th, arrived at Pinghe on the 28th, and camped at Baihou, Dabu, Guangdong Province, on the 29th. They rested for one day on the 30th, arrived at Sanheba on March 31st, arrived at Songkou on April 1st, rested for one day, and advanced towards Meixian City on the 3rd, joining the First Column. The First Column set off from the Mei-Xing Highway via Nankouwei to Xingning on the 4th, while the Second Column rested in Meicheng. Commander Huang Yanzhen of the 7th Division stationed in Mei specially sent Liang Baoluo, Ouyang Feng, and others to take care of everything. They had designated the 19th Route Army's garrison location in advance, and the reception arrangements along the way were quite thorough. When the First Column departed from Mei, about 16,000 students from Meixian Provincial Fifth Middle School, Dongshan Middle School, County Middle School, Leyu Middle School, Guangyi Middle School, and various boys' and girls' schools sang military songs and bid farewell to Gutangping Airfield, eight li from the city. The sound of firecrackers and heroic songs shook the clear sky. The Second Column continued to arrive in Meicheng on the morning of the 4th. On this day, all agencies, groups, and schools in Meixian were also very busy welcoming them. Those who went to welcome them gathered at the Meisong Road Main Station at Beimengang in the morning. The unit began to arrive completely at 2 PM. The welcomers set off firecrackers. Chief of Staff Rong and the First Regiment Commander Yang Changhuang and Second Regiment Commander Wu Luxun shook hands with each representative in the welcome pavilion at the station as a courtesy. At about 4 PM, all circles carried the gifts of appreciation to each regiment and battalion and distributed them to the soldiers separately. The County Party Department presented a banner inscribed "Restore Our Rivers and Mountains," the 7th Division Headquarters presented a banner inscribed "Resist Japan and Save the Nation," and all circles presented a banner inscribed "Kill the Enemy to the End." The Second Column's officers and soldiers numbered more than one thousand more than the First Column. Chief of Staff Rong's wife, Ms. Xu, Chief Medical Officer Peng's wife, Ms. Pan, and female propaganda nurses were all dressed in military uniforms and served with the army, full of patriotism. In addition, there were about seventy student soldiers who had served in the Songhu Battle and students from Feng Yong University. Many other university and middle school students also abandoned their studies to follow the army. They had all joined the training regiment after entering Fujian with the 19th Route Army last summer and received military training. It is said that they have graduated, so they accompanied the camp northward to resist Japan. In addition, there were engineering teams, heavy artillery teams, anti-aircraft artillery teams, communications teams, and medical teams. From the 5th to the 6th, the First Column began to advance towards Xingning. The Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office has notified the county magistrates of Longchuan, Heping, and Lianping to take good care of them along the way. (April 10th)</p>

<p>Passing Through Taiyuan En Route to Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Led by Regiment Commander Zhi Yinglin</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Farewell from the Populace Along the Way</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since 1919, guest troops stationed in Jin territory have recently been ordered to the front line one after another due to the outbreak of war with Japan. Apart from Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and other major units, only part of Sun Dianying's unit is currently stationed in Jincheng. The unit of [blank] Gang Zhangrenjie stationed in Jiexiu has also been led by Fang Zhenwu to Hebei Province, heading north along the Pinghan Line. The training regiment of Song Zheyuan's unit stationed in Fenyang has also been ordered to move to Zhangjiakou, led by Regiment Commander Zhi Yinglin. It departed on the 10th and arrived in Taiyuan last night (11th). Today (12th), it will depart for Datong and transfer to Zhangjiakou. This regiment was reorganized from Feng Yuxiang's former guard unit. Military discipline is strict, uniforms are neat, and morale is extremely high. The populace of each county passed along the way enthusiastically welcomed them and presented gifts. The gifts included 11,600 yuan from the entire populace of Fenyang County, a large silk banner from He Fen Middle School, a large rectangular red banner from Mingyi Middle School, one hundred handgun bullets from the Public Security Bureau Chief, a large rectangular red banner from County Magistrate Han Mingfu, two large silk banners from the Finance Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Education Bureau, Construction Bureau, and Chamber of Commerce, two large rectangular red banners from Christian schools and organizations, one hundred and twenty pairs of socks from the textile factory, and a satin banner and one hundred towels from Mr. Zhang Fanwu and others.

The regiment also issued a declaration of departure, about a thousand words long, explaining that the departure was to assist the soldiers of the 29th and 41st Armies in resisting Japan, and stating that to overthrow imperialism, it is necessary not only for our army but also to mobilize the revolutionary masses of the whole country to participate in this great and arduous war in order to achieve victory. Now we are going to the front line, and we hope that all circles of the country will come to the front line. Now is the critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation. Non-resistance means death. We must muster our courage and strive for China's independence and unity. The regiment also issued a public notice along the way, which stated that since Jehol has fallen, the enemy's arrogance has become more intense. The officers and soldiers of this unit are all pained by the brutality of the Japanese invaders and are mindful of the imminent national demise. They are determined to kill the enemy and have already made a resolution. This time, they are ordered to go north and rush to the battlefield, fulfilling their duty as soldiers. However, fearing that people from all walks of life are unaware of the truth and may be alarmed by the army's presence, a clear notice is hereby issued. The discipline of this army has always been extremely strict. Public purchases and sales will be made in the places it passes through, and the people will never be disturbed. If there are unscrupulous soldiers or local ruffians who use the name of this army to spread rumors and cause trouble, merchants and people are permitted to immediately arrest them and send them to this headquarters for severe punishment according to the law, without any leniency. Let all circles of people be fully informed. Sincerely, this notice. (April 12th)</p>

<p>Bandit Gangs Focus on Attacking Fuzhou</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Attacks the Main Force of the Bandits</p>
<p>The Situation on the Gan River is Easing</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Chinese Communists (Red Bandits) have launched an all-out attack this time. The plan of the counterfeit military committee is to have the counterfeit central army, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Corps, as the central route, gathering at Yihuang and Lean to attack Fuzhou; the counterfeit Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian Military Region's Fang Shao's counterfeit 10th Army, 30th, 31st, 32nd and other divisions, leaving Xinhe and attacking Jinxi and Dongxiang as the right route; and scattered bandits on the east and west banks of the Gan River, gathered at Yongfeng and Xiajiang, led by Mao Zedong, going down the Gan River and the Gan-Yue Road, attempting to seize Zhangshu as the left route. After Fuzhou is captured, the three routes will then conspire to seize Nanchang. All of the above forces are commanded by the counterfeit commander-in-chief Zhu De. However, among the bandits' three routes this time, they are completely focused on Fuzhou. On the Xin River front, Fang's bandits have only three or four thousand rifles. Although they attacked and captured Dongxiang County on the 11th at Majiawei, on the Jinxi-Linchuan border, it is irrelevant to the overall war situation. The Mao bandits on the east bank of the Gan River occasionally send plainclothes teams to invade the vicinity of Zhangshu, but they only repeatedly harass to create a diversion, cover the main force, and attempt to seize Fuzhou. President Chiang Kai-shek had already seen through the bandits' cunning scheme, so he specially ordered Liu Zhi to go to Fuzhou to supervise the war on his behalf, leading the central route's various columns to attack the bandits' main force. On the Xin River front, Zhang Zhizhong's division has recently arrived, and Dongxiang can be recovered soon. On the Gan River front, in addition to Chen Cheng and other units firmly defending the Qiqin-Mifeng area bordering Chongren, Fengcheng, Lean, and Xingan to prevent the bandits from flanking Fuzhou, and Sun Lianzhong's unit resolutely defending Yongfeng City to contain the bandits' main force, Dai Yue's unit, which recently arrived in Jiangxi, is advancing upstream along the Gan River and the Gan-Yue Road from Zhangshu. Yesterday (12th), they defeated Luo Binghui's counterfeit 22nd Army in the Yongtai area below Xingan and above Jijiang, and pursued them in victory. A phone call was received from Zhangshu a moment ago stating that Dai's unit had recovered Xingan County today (13th), and the counterfeit 21st, 22nd Army, and Independent 4th and 5th Divisions had scattered and retreated to Yongfeng, Lean, Xiajiang, and other places. The situation on the Gan River has therefore eased, and Zhangshu has also turned from danger to safety. It is heard that Chiang, in order to quickly suppress the Red Bandits, has added large armies from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, and other provinces into Jiangxi, and has dispatched the 4th Squadron of fighters stationed in Hankou, eight Jiangkun and Jiangxi warships, one after another to Jiangxi, in order to coordinate with the military operations, so the future of bandit suppression is [blank].

<h3 id="e89">Circumstances of the Public Trial <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court, considering that Chen, Peng, and others were all important figures of the Trotskyist faction of the Chinese Communist Party, specially requested the Police Department of the [blank] Ministry to send a platoon of armed security guards to the Jiangning District Court on the morning of the 14th to be on alert. Because this case caused a sensation at the time, as many as eighty or ninety people went to observe. At 9:45 AM, presiding judge Hu Shan [blank], judges Lin Zhemin and Zhang Bingci, clerk Shen Yuren, prosecutor Zhu [blank], and others ascended the courtroom. The defense lawyers for Chen, Peng, and others, Zhang Shizhao, Wu Zhiping, Peng Wanglin, Jiang Haoshi, Liu Zuwang, and other five people, also arrived one after another. Judge Hu then summoned Chen, Peng, and the other ten to the court, asking each of their names, ages, places of origin, addresses, and occupations. They were then returned to the waiting room and Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Wang Wu, and others were questioned individually. Chen Duxiu was wearing a blue cloth long gown and cloth cotton robe, and Peng Shuzhi was wearing a gray cloth cotton robe. During the questioning, their attitudes were calm and composed. At times, witty remarks arose, causing laughter throughout the court. The court adjourned at 1:30 PM. At 9 AM on the 15th, the trial of the remaining defendants continued.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Prosecutor's Public Indictment <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After summoning the defendants to the court, the prosecutor first stood up to present the public indictment, stating briefly: "In October of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on a confidential report, stated that on the upper floor of No. 210 Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Public Concession, there was a counterfeit central organ of the Communist Party. The Bureau immediately dispatched inspectors Tang Bao and Zhang Qingtai, holding a letter to issue a search and arrest warrant from the First Special District Court, together with Detective Gower and Detective Clerk of the Patrol Force, and others, to go to the address at 3 PM on the 15th of the same month. Xie Shaoshan and the defendants Pu Yifan, Peng Shuzhi (i.e., Zhang Cinan), Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun), Wang Zhao [blank], and other five people were holding a meeting, so they were arrested together. A large number of reactionary documents were seized at the scene, as well as several pieces of paper with communication addresses. The detectives then, based on this location, went to the upper floor of No. 11 Yongxing Lane, Yuezhou Road, at 7 PM on the same day, and arrested the defendant Chen Duxiu, and seized a large number of reactionary documents. At about 9 PM, they searched the home of Pu Yifan at No. 322 Gaofu Lane, Shengmuyuan Road, seized various reactionary documents, and arrested Wang Xiaochun. At about 12 midnight that night, they went to No. 1044 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. Because it was late at night, the sound of knocking on the door alarmed the people in the lane. Two people jumped out of the window. One escaped, and only the defendant Liang Youguang was arrested, and many reactionary documents were seized. At 7:30 AM on the 16th, at the lower floor of No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, the defendants Wang Ziping and He Afang were printing the Communist Party publications Spark and School Life. They were arrested together with the evidence. At 12 noon, the defendant Wang Jiantang was arrested at No. 22 Fuqing Lane, and ten kinds of reactionary books were seized. Previously, after the detectives arrested Wang Ziping and others at No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, they sent people to secretly guard the place. Until the 17th, the defendant Guo Jinghao (i.e., Peng Daozhi), unaware that the matter had been exposed, went to the place and was also arrested. They were then sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to send them back. Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi were first transferred to the Military Law Department of the Army Department of the Ministry of Military Administration for questioning. They were found to have no connection with the Communist bandits in Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places, and Chen Duxiu and others were not active-duty soldiers, and the crime scene did not comply with the first paragraph of Article 7 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic. It was believed that the Ministry had no jurisdiction, so it was transferred to the Ministry of Justice and Administration for handling according to the law. This office collected evidence and interrogated them repeatedly. Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and others all admitted without hesitation to joining the Communist Party, founding the Chinese Communist Party Left Opposition faction, and being elected as central committee members. While the investigation was in progress, it was learned that the Public Concession Patrol Force had also subsequently seized more than forty kinds of reactionary documents in Chen Duxiu's home. A member was sent to the Central Party Headquarters to collect them all, and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was requested to transfer the co-defendants Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, Liang Youguang, Wang Jiantang, Wang Xiaochun, and other nine people to this office for joint trial. As a result of the investigation, except for Wang Xiaochun, who was found to have no conclusive evidence and was given a separate decision not to prosecute, Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi (i.e., Zhang Cinan), Pu Yifan, Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun), Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhao [blank], Guo Jinghao (i.e., Peng Daozhi), Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang organized groups or assemblies for the purpose of endangering the Republic, all violating Article 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic. In addition, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi used words to promote treason, and Wang Ziping and He Afang assisted in the promotion of treason, also carrying a great suspicion of violating Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the same law. The seized Communist books and documents are all for criminal use and criminal preparation. Please confiscate them all in accordance with Article 10 of the same law and Article 60, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. In accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I hereby file a public prosecution."</p>
<h3 id="e91">First, Chen Duxiu is Summoned for Trial <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the prosecutor finished reading the indictment, Judge Hu immediately summoned Chen Duxiu for interrogation, asking about his age, place of origin, and occupation. According to Chen Duxiu's statement, he was 55 years old, from Huaining, Anhui. During the fifth and sixth years of the Republic (1916-1917), he was a university professor in Beijing for a total of 23 years. Around the 19th year of the Republic (1930), he went to Shanghai, and in the 11th and 12th years (1922-1923), he went to Guangdong, serving as the Director of the Guangdong Education Department for about a year. After that, he returned to Shanghai and had no occupation. In 1927, he was elected as the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, guiding the activities of the Communist Party. During the Nationalist Party's purge of the Communists, he participated in Communist Party work in Wuhan and had no other social activities. (The judge asked) Is the Third International satisfied with you? (Chen replied) Satisfied in some areas, not satisfied in others. (Asked) What kind of position is the Secretary? (Answered) It's the General Secretary, also the Central Chairman. (Asked) When were you expelled from the Communist Party? (Answered) Around the 17th or 18th year of the Republic (1928 or 1929). (Asked) Why were you expelled? (Answered) Due to differences in opinion. (Asked) Where were the differences in opinion? (Answered) These are internal party matters; I don't want to say more. (Asked), (Asked)</p>
<p>Have you worked for the Nationalist Party? (Answered) No, I haven't before the purge of the Communists or after I was expelled. I haven't done anything. (Asked) What did you do in Shanghai after you were expelled? (Answered) I didn't do anything, nor did I write any books. (Asked) Which faction of the Communist Party do you belong to? (Answered) The Trotskyist faction. (Asked) Is the Communist Party divided into Stalinist and Trotskyist factions? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) What is the situation of the Trotskyist faction? (Answered) The Trotskyist faction doesn't have many members in Russia. Trotsky is the leader. He used to be in Turkey, and now he's there, but because I don't read the newspaper, I don't know. I served as a Standing Committee member in the Trotskyist faction. (Asked) Do you have any writings in the "Spark" publication? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) When did you meet Peng Shuzhi? (Answered) A long time ago, around 1922 or 1923. We met in Moscow. (Asked) Have you been to Japan? (Answered) I've been to Japan many times in the past. I studied in Japan, studying law, politics, and literature. I didn't graduate. (Asked) What did you go to Moscow for? (Answered) To take a look. I stayed for a month and then came back. (Asked) Where is the headquarters of the Trotskyist faction located? (Answered) This is an internal party matter; I don't want to say more. Please ask me about matters within the scope of the indictment. (Asked) Does the Third International provide you with assistance? (Answered) The Third International is the Stalinist faction and has no relationship with us. (Asked) Are there many people in your faction? (Answered) Our organization exists throughout the country, but we don't have many members, and our power is small. More workers participate, followed by students. In rural areas, we don't yet have the power to enter. (Asked) Roughly how many places are there in your party? (Asked) Do they join because they believe in the ideology? (Answered) Of course, otherwise, they wouldn't come to join. (Asked) Where does your financial support come from? (Answered) We raise it ourselves. Teachers contribute a portion of their salary, and workers contribute a portion of their wages. The amounts vary. (Asked) Do both the "Spark" and "School Life" publications contain your writings? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Do you use the pseudonym "Li" in the concessions? (Answered) Of course, otherwise, I would have been arrested long ago. (Asked) Is Peng Shuzhi in the same organization as you? (Answered) Yes, he's also a Standing Committee member. He and I were expelled at the same time. (Asked) How many Standing Committee members are there in total? (Answered) Three official and two alternate. (Asked) Who are the alternate Standing Committee members? (Answered) Pu Yifang and Luo Shifan. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that I did not read the records during the previous preliminary hearing. Today, the prosecutor mentioned in the indictment that Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun are alternate Standing Committee members, which is very strange. Song Fengchun is not an alternate Standing Committee member because, first, Song Fengchun was only released from prison when he was arrested. How could he be a Standing Committee member while in prison? Furthermore, any party has an odd number of Standing Committee members, either five or seven. If he were a Standing Committee member, there would be six people, which is absolutely impossible. Also, our alternate Standing Committee member, Pu Yifang, is from Sichuan, over thirty years old, and has a very dark complexion, not at all good-looking. But the one I saw today is a young child with a fair and beautiful face, not our Pu Yifang. (Asked) Peng Shuzhi once stated that the alternate Standing Committee members were Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun? (Answered) I don't know what he said, but according to my knowledge, it's not true. (At this point, lawyer Zhang Shizhao requested that the preliminary hearing records be given to Chen to read, and Chen also requested to see the documents. The judge gave Chen a package containing the "Spark" and "School Life" publications for detailed review. After about twenty minutes, Chen acknowledged that they were their publications.) (Asked) Is your claim that a Soviet government should be established first, and then the Red Army should be organized? (Answered) Yes. The Red Army is a military organization that should be based on the poor, peasants, and workers. (Asked) According to the current situation in China, do you think a Red Army is necessary? (Answered) The Red Army is just a name. I advocate the establishment of a peasant army. China's current situation is not about not writing about the Red Army, but organizing the Red Army according to the current situation is still impossible. (Asked) When will a Red Army be needed? (Answered) A Red Army is needed when there is political power, otherwise, the political power cannot be maintained. (Asked) What are your opinions on riots? (Answered) Revolutionary parties must riot to seize political power. The Nationalist Party's revolution was also a riot. (Asked) What do the three words "Soviet" mean? (Answered) It doesn't have any special meaning; it just means "meeting". (Asked) Should capitalists be overthrown? (Answered) Of course. (Asked) Do you advocate seizing political power? (Answered) Of course. What is a political party called if it doesn't want to seize political power? (Asked) Is labor-capital compromise right? (Answered) There is absolutely no possibility of labor-capital compromise. (Asked) Do you advocate organizing a proletarian government? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Is there a publication called "Axe"? Is it yours? (Answered) Yes, it's distributed in North China. I'm not very clear who the editor is. I am the editor of "Spark." "School Life" is a publication from the South. (Asked) Is the Secretary the highest position? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Do the "Red Bandits" in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui have anything to do with you? (Answered) No. (Asked) Do you participate? (Answered) Now is not the time for rioting. (At this point, the judge questioned in detail various important documents in the "Spark" and "School Life" publications to determine if they were written by Chen. Chen truthfully acknowledged each one. Among the main ones were: Opposing imperialism, developing the armed struggle of peasants and workers, opposing the Nationalist Party's two-line struggle, the current situation and tasks, accusing Japanese imperialists of invading Manchuria, resisting Japan to save the country, the Second Revolution, implementing the eight-hour system, publicizing military power, opposing the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, the situation after the League of Nations resolution, and a letter to comrades in the party about resisting Japan to save the country.) (Asked) What is the goal of the Trotskyist faction? (Answered) The biggest goal is world revolution, and the ultimate goal is the national liberation of China, opposing the military dictatorship system and seizing political power. (Asked) Do you advocate convening a national assembly with non-registered elections? (Answered) Yes. We have the right to convene this meeting if we have the power. The Nationalist Party has the right to convene it, and we will also participate. (Asked) Is it true that you cannot cooperate with the Red Bandits in Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Fujian due to differences in political views? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Is your headquarters in Shanghai? (Answered) Yes, it's in my residence, on a very small scale. (Asked) Are your publications public? (Answered) Of course, we want them to be public; anyone can read them, but the government prohibits it, so everyone can't see them. Now, the judge finally has the opportunity to see them. (Asked) Do you often meet? (Answered) We meet often. (Asked) Were you arrested while meeting? (Answered) I was sick and didn't know. I've been sick for two months, but I used to participate in meetings. (Asked) Do you know about the many small notes found during the search? (Answered) I don't know. (Asked) Do you recognize all ten people who were arrested? (Answered) I recognize some, but not others. (Asked) Which ones do you recognize? (Answered) I cannot report on the internal affairs of the party. I can only talk about political opinions. It's the government's detectives' responsibility to determine who is a Communist. I cannot be a government detective. At this point, the judge asked Chen for the reasons for opposing the National Government. Chen listed three points and concluded by saying, "I admit that I oppose the National Government, but I do not admit that I endanger the Republic of China. I will present the reasons in detail during the debate." It was already 11:35 AM. The judge, considering that the interrogation was detailed enough, ordered Chen to leave the court and summoned Peng Shuzhi for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Next, Peng Shuzhi is Summoned for Trial <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>(The judge asked) When did you join the Communist Party? (Peng answered) Around 1921. (Asked) What did you do before? (Answered) I studied in Hunan. After graduating, I taught at a higher primary school in Baoqing. Later, I joined the Communist Party. At that time, the Communist Party was not divided into factions. I was a CY (Communist Youth League member) and didn't do much work. (Asked) When did you meet Chen Duxiu? (Answered) In 1921 in Moscow. I studied at the Eastern University in Russia for four years. After graduating, I taught at that school. In 1924, I returned to China and edited publications such as "New Youth" in Shanghai and joined the Central Bureau. (Asked) Did you join Chen Duxiu's faction because you admired his writing? (Answered) There's no such thing as admiration or not. My advocacy for the liberation of China is the same as Chen Duxiu's. (Asked) When were you expelled from the Communist Party and why? (Answered) I was expelled at the same time as Chen Duxiu because of differences in political views. (Asked) Are you a Trotskyist? (Answered) Actually, it can't be called a Trotskyist faction. He's just a leader. (Asked) What exactly are the differences in your so-called political views? (Answered) It's hard to say. Generally speaking, I have different opinions on the attitude towards Soviet Russia and the proletarian movement system in Europe and China. (Asked) What is the foundation of the Communist Party? (Answered) Workers and peasants. As for the petty bourgeoisie, they often waver between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Relying on them for revolution is not feasible. (Asked) Is organizing an army necessary? (Answered) The dictatorship of the proletariat definitely needs a Red Army, but organizing a Red Army should be done after the victory of the proletarian revolution. Before the victory, only peasants can be armed. As for why China can produce such a large Red Army now, it is entirely due to objective conditions because the rural areas are bankrupt. (Asked) How many Trotskyists are there in Shanghai? (Answered) Our organization is promoting its doctrines and is not yet widespread. The strength is not great, and the number of people is not large. (Asked) Where does your funding come from? (Answered) We take it out of our own pockets. (Asked) Are you a Central Committee member? (Answered) Yes, I was elected at the same time as Chen Duxiu. The three Standing Committee members are Chen Duxiu, Zhang Jiwen (Note: this is a phonetic transcription), and me. The alternate Standing Committee members are Pu Yifang and Luo Shifan. (At this point, Peng again stated that he had not read the preliminary hearing records and proved that Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun were not alternate Central Committee members. Song was just a "party member." This is the same as what Chen Duxiu said. He also wrote down the names of Pu Yifang and Luo Shifan in handwriting and presented them to the court.) (Asked) Does the Third International provide you with any assistance? (Answered) No. (Asked) Did you edit the "Spark" and "School Life" publications? (Answered) Everything with my signature was done by me. (Asked) Do you oppose the National Government? (Answered) Of course, I oppose it. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. (At this point, Peng Shuzhi stated three reasons for his opposition.) (Asked) Have you had any riots? (Answered) There were no riots. There was, of course, written propaganda. (At this point, it was already 12:30 PM. The judge then ordered him to leave the court and summoned Pu Yifan.)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Song and Two Others Cry Injustice <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The judge then summoned Pu Yifan, who stated that he was 29 years old, from Huaining, Anhui, and resided at 322 Gaofuli, Mumuyuan Road, Shanghai. He had studied at Waseda University in Japan. After returning to China, he taught at a middle school in Anhui for a year and then went to Shanghai to engage in literary life. At the time of the arrest, he was the editor of a monthly magazine at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a monthly salary of 150 yuan. He didn't understand what an alternate Standing Committee member even was. At the time of the arrest, he was at Xie Shaoshan's house, but he didn't go there for a meeting; he went to find Zeng Zhaowei (Note: this is a phonetic transcription) because Li Weixia, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, saw that my work was too hard and asked me to find a proofreader to copy. I went to Dongyouheng Road to find Zeng Zhaowei, but he wasn't there. Xie Shaoshan told me to wait a while. I don't know how I was arrested. The documents found in my residence were sent there by a friend. If they were mine, there would be no need to deny it. It's ridiculous that Xie Shaoshan said I was a committee member in the Second Branch of the High Court. How could I be a committee member if I'm not a Communist? After the arrest, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wanted to bail me out, but he himself had problems with another case. There were four people in the monthly magazine editorial department, and they were afraid of being implicated because of the Communist suspicion case, so of course they didn't dare to speak up. I am being wronged. Chen Duxiu once stated in the Second Branch of the High Court that he didn't know me; there are records to check. At this time, lawyer Hua Zuwang also stood up and stated that the box found in Pu's residence had another mark on it, which should be noted, and that many letters in the box had been discarded by the Western police, so the Western police who conducted the search should be summoned to testify. Pu also stated that the search was illegal, saying that they were hitting and bumping randomly and that he had asked the Western police to register the documents in the box, but they were not allowed to do so. It was 12:45 PM. The judge summoned Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun), who stated that he was arrested on October 15th of last year in Chunyangli, Dongyouheng Road. I went to Xie Shaoshan to borrow money because I was released on bail from prison due to illness on October 5th and didn't have a single penny. Xie Shaoshan was a friend of mine from before. He agreed to lend me money, so I went with him, and I was arrested. I used to be a Trotskyist in the Communist Party, but after being released on bail on October 5th, Zhu had no actions. Saying that I am an alternate Central Committee member of the Communist Party, I cannot mix fish eyes with pearls. Please don't call a deer a horse in court either. It was 1:30 PM. The judge summoned the defendants and announced that the time was up for today and that the trial would continue at 9:00 AM tomorrow (the 15th).</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Magistrate Demolishes the Fence Built Around Yuecheng <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since the demolition of the west gate of this city, it has become a prosperous area. The former county party department had proposed building a Sun Yat-sen memorial monument on the Yuecheng site and sent a letter to the county government for handling. Later, due to the fact that a Mr. Wu had leased vacant land from the government property bureau at that location, if the memorial monument project were to proceed, it would hinder Mr. Wu's leased land and the buildings constructed. He repeatedly filed appeals with the provincial and county governments to revoke the county government's decision on the design plan and the method of allocating land sections for public use after acquiring private land. People from all walks of life also repeatedly petitioned the provincial and county governments to support the party department's proposal. Official documents were exchanged back and forth for three years, and the case piled up. Later, the provincial government ordered the civil affairs and construction departments to review and decide to move the Sun Yat-sen memorial monument to Zhongshan Park in Yuhuangge, while the original proposed site for the monument in Yuecheng was reserved for public construction and handled in accordance with the county government's land section allocation method to resolve the dispute. The provincial government immediately relayed the order to the county government for implementation. The former County Magistrate Shen announced the order. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wu hastily built a fence around the vacant land, and the current County Magistrate Jin also ordered the Public Security Bureau and the First District Office to protect it. After being warned by the bureau and office, Mr. Wu also wrote a petition to the county for instructions, which has now been approved. The approval stated that since the case has been determined by the provincial government, the county government can only strictly comply with it. The built fence should still be demolished immediately to facilitate allocation. It is said that County Magistrate Jin will actively handle the allocation of land sections to resolve the dispute and appease the public's expectations.</p>

<p>The Tongren Pawnshop, originally located in Chefangzhen, Wu County, suffered significant losses due to robbery. It moved to Tonglizhen in this county last year to operate. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 12th, a sudden fire broke out, completely destroying all the silver, jewelry, and storage rooms. The Second District Office reported the incident to the county government for on-site inspection to determine the actual situation. The county government has now ordered the County Chamber of Commerce, the Second District Chief, and the Chief of the Second Public Security Branch to jointly supervise the pawnshop, collect the pawned goods, and submit a list to the county for verification to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Cai Pei, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District, stated that Wuxi and Wujin counties under his jurisdiction are known as special silk areas in Jiangsu Province for their prosperity and development. Recently, affected by the social economy, farmers' livelihoods have been exhausted, and it is difficult to maintain their operations. Now that the silkworm season is approaching, it is imperative to rescue the silkworm breeding industry. He has formulated rescue measures, which are divided into two main points: (1) Farmers' silkworm breeding capital should be provided with low-interest loans to complete their operational strength. (2) The price of spring cocoons in this period should be considered in advance, and a maximum price should be determined and announced to farmers to arouse their interest. The above measures have been telegraphed to each county yesterday, summoning the responsible representatives of the relevant industries to quickly implement the measures to revitalize people's livelihoods and save the industry.</p>

<p>The reconstruction project of the Zhencheng Road and Chengwu Road, the section from Xiwai to Xishiqiao, has been gradually completed. On the 13th, County Magistrate Ruan and acting technical director Yang Pinsun inspected the western countryside and also inspected the Xiagang River project. County Magistrate Ruan found that the roadbed of the Chengwu section had several projects that were quite simple and crude, with the roadbed and the field base indistinguishable in height. If it rained, the roadbed would be destroyed. He immediately ordered the village chiefs to persuade the working farmers to build the roadbed firmly and to take the soil from the ditches on both sides to achieve a permanent solution. This inspection ended at Xishiqiao, and they returned to the city that night.</p>

After a preliminary hearing by Team Leader Zhu, it was stated that the victim was sent by Dong Zuopei, a town guard, to the town.

In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Executive Yuan ordered the county to seal them all and the county government sent personnel to manage them. The Wu County government received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday to clear all of them and return them to the Sheng family for management. It is also reported that the Sheng family's properties in Changzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places will also be returned to the Sheng family.</p>

<p>In Chuanshan Village, about two miles away from Shishen in the southern countryside of Huzhou, there is a farmer named Shen Yatou, whose family is well-off, which led to bandits coveting their property. Around midnight the day before yesterday, two bandit ships suddenly arrived, carrying more than twenty bandits, each armed with guns and speaking in a Hakka accent. They broke into the house, overturning boxes and cabinets, and carried out a large-scale search, looting cotton, silk clothes, silk, jewelry, etc., with losses of about 200 yuan. Shen Yatou was shot in the leg by the bandits, and his son, Liushun, was injured in the face. Afterward, the family sent them to the Kuihu Police Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 13th, several soldiers from the artillery battalion of Liu Zhennian's army went to the nearby Hutou Chen area to capture chickens and ducks in the countryside, which led to the villagers ringing gongs and gathering a crowd to take them back, which aroused the soldiers' anger. They fired more than ten shots, injuring five farmers and killing two. That night, the villagers reported to the county for instructions. County Magistrate Zhang immediately convened an emergency meeting of various legal groups and telegraphed the province for instructions.</p>

<p>Qidu in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan is known for producing bamboo shoots. This year, the output is limited, which has led to an increase in prices, and many poor households often steal them privately, so the mountain owners all hate it. On the morning of the 14th, someone secretly stole from a bamboo shoot garden owned by the Gu family. They suspected that the neighbor, the Shen family, had done it. They searched the Shen family's house at that time, and they quarreled with each other. The Gu family and the Shen family immediately fought. As a result, two members of the Shen family were killed. Seeing that they had caused a disaster, the Gu family immediately asked the gentry to come forward to mediate, and then compensated for the matter.</p>

<p>Yesterday Afternoon He Met with Premier Wang to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>Baysung Hsu, Chin Fen, Young, and Several Others Will Accompany Him</p>
<p>Finance Minister T.V. Soong has agreed to serve as a representative to the Washington Conference. According to reliable information yesterday, Mr. Soong is scheduled to sail to the United States on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Jackson on the 18th. He is currently preparing everything for his departure. Yesterday morning, Legislative Yuan Vice President Shao Yuanchong, Chen Jitang's representative Yang Dezhao, and Central Committee member Li Shizeng visited Mr. Soong at Qizhai Road one after another to discuss matters. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Soong went to Bushi Road to meet with Premier Wang Jingwei to discuss the financial arrangements after Mr. Soong's departure to the United States and his opinions on attending the Washington Conference. When the reporter met with Mr. Soong yesterday afternoon, Mr. Soong said that the Washington Conference is a discussion for our country to exchange views on world economic issues and has no pre-determined agenda. The discussion will generally include tariffs, silver prices, and war debt issues that are not related to our country. The Far East issue is of course included. I am scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship on the 18th or 19th to go to the United States and will arrive in two weeks. My wife will not be traveling with me. I will be in the United States for about a month and a half before returning to China. During my absence from the country, Vice Ministers Li Tiaosheng and Zou Lin will be responsible for the ministry's affairs. Mr. Zhang Shouyong will assist from time to time based on his personal relationship with me. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has sent a telegram inviting me to visit Jiangxi, and Mr. Wang has also urged me to talk to Mr. Chiang first, but I am afraid that it will delay the schedule and affect the departure, so I have telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and will not go to Nanjing. The accompanying personnel are Bank of China President Baysung Hsu, Ministry of Finance advisor Young, secretary Huang Chundao, National Economic Council Qin Fen, and former secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United States Wei Wenbin, and six or seven others. Mr. Hsu has extensive research on economic issues, and Mr. Wei has always had good relations with the American political world.</p>

<p>The German Doctor's Surgical Treatment Went Well</p>
<p>Resting at his Residence and Will Return to Nanjing Today</p>
<p>Premier Wang Jingwei has recently suffered from a back carbuncle, which is related to diabetes. Therefore, he came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. That night, he invited a German doctor, whom he knew well, to perform surgery at his residence on Bushi Road. According to those around Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang completed the consultation at 10:00 PM the previous night. The German doctor then injected anesthesia, immediately cut open the red and swollen skin and flesh, about the size of a teacup, and scooped out the rotten flesh, about the size of a walnut. He then sutured and wrapped it up. It was already about 11:00 PM, and he took a sleeping pill to fall asleep. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, he was still receiving guests at his residence. Central Committee member Zhang Qun visited Mr. Wang around 9:00 AM and talked for about twenty minutes before leaving. Li Shizeng and Wu Tiecheng and others visited one after another, all to inquire about his health and had no other tasks. At 4:00 PM, T.V. Soong visited and chatted for a long time. Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing today. He also issued a written statement yesterday morning stating that the reports in the newspapers yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) about his conversations with reporters were all accurate, but there were minor errors, which may have been due to mishearing at the time. Wang came here to determine the candidates to go to the United States with Minister Soong and to discuss the financial arrangements after Mr. Soong goes to the United States, not to urge Mr. Soong to go to the United States, because Mr. Soong has long considered it necessary to go to the United States himself.</p>

Cai Yuanpei, representing the Central Party Headquarters, and Song Ziwen, representing the Executive Yuan, delivered instructive addresses. All bank staff attended and participated. After Mr. Kong delivered his reply, the ceremony concluded at 10:00 AM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>After the ceremony proceeded as scheduled, the new President, Kong Xiangxi, raised his left hand and read the oath aloud. The oath stated: "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 (kè zūn - respectfully obey) the Founder's Will, obey the Party, abide by national laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and economize on expenses.

<p>Cai Yuanpei, representing the Central Party Headquarters, delivered an instructive address, stating: "Today, former Minister Kong has been ordered to assume the position of President of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi (left), President, and Song Ziwen (right), Minister, taking a photo together (photographed by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>The Central Bank is a national bank, and its mission is different from other banks. It is of great importance to the future of the country. Under the current circumstances, its major missions are approximately three-fold: (1) To relieve and revitalize the rural areas. Our country's rural economy is already in a state of bankruptcy. It is hoped that President Kong will use the power of the nation's financial center to find ways to provide relief and seek the revitalization of the rural areas; (2) To promote domestic goods. Our country's domestic goods still cannot compete with foreign goods, resulting in foreign goods flooding the market, capital outflow, and the decline of industry and commerce. An important reason is the limitation of capital. It is hoped that the financial sector will find ways to support the development of industry and commerce; (3) To reform the currency. The government has issued a clear order to unify the currency, abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. In its initial stage, the national currency has not yet become uniform. The Central Bank is responsible for regulating the national finance and supplying hard currency. It is hoped that the mission of currency unification can be completed in a short period of time. The Central Bank was founded by Minister Song. In the past, the results have been excellent. As for various plans that have not been implemented, it is hoped that Comrade Kong will continue to implement them. The future of the country depends on this. The Party has great expectations."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Song's Address <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen delivered an instructive address, stating: "Today, I represent the National Government and the Executive Yuan. In my capacity as former President, I will briefly offer my humble opinions and bid farewell to all the comrades of the Central Bank. The establishment of the Central Bank was the dying wish of our late Founder. Therefore, the steps taken were not overly hasty, but proceeded step by step, hoping to consolidate the foundation. Therefore, in recent years, despite repeated floods, internal unrest, and foreign aggression, the Central Bank has been able to stand firm. This is due to this approach. As for all the internal affairs of the Central Bank, everything is open and transparent, because the credit of a national bank is the credit of the nation. Therefore, the candidates for supervisors and directors of this bank are mostly famous figures in society. I recall that when dealing with the Hankou flood two years ago, the government, in response to the actual needs, established a flood relief committee. The public initially had doubts but later became convinced. Similarly, in the past, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly dispatched high-ranking officials to reorganize it due to the poor performance of its managers, but to no avail. However, this is not the case now. My resignation from the presidency of the Central Bank has caused external doubts, which are actually inaccurate. In fact, I resigned because the Central Bank is gradually developing, and its affairs are numerous, and I cannot take care of both. Therefore, Mr. Kong will succeed me. Mr. Kong has been involved in practical industries and has new ideas and the courage to take action, so he will definitely be able to take on the job. I am here to say goodbye to my colleagues at the Central Bank. I hope that my colleagues at the Central Bank will love Mr. Kong as they love Ziwen, so that the future of the Central Bank can become increasingly prosperous."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Kong's Reply <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>President Kong Xiangxi replied, stating: "This time, I have been ordered to assume the position of President of the Central Bank. I believe that the President's position is of great importance to the nation's finance, and because of my ill health, I had expressed my unwillingness to take on the job. Because the Central Bank was founded single-handedly by Minister Song and has a close relationship with the nation's finances, Minister Song should continue to serve during this time of national crisis. Later, I was repeatedly urged by my comrades in the Central Government to take office in order to express the spirit of overcoming national difficulties together. Now, in response to Mr. Cai's instructive address, I hope to achieve the main points of the Central Bank and to complete the mission of the Central Bank, as reported by Minister Song. I will certainly abide by this. In the early days of preparing the Central Bank in Guangdong, I received a handwritten order from the Founder and allocated 3,000 yuan, ordering Minister Song to prepare. At that time, Guangdong was occupied by warlords. Minister Song used a spirit of adventure to borrow money to print banknotes from the American Bank Note Company. I once served as the Minister of Industry, Acting Minister of Finance, and President of the Central Bank in Guangdong, but neither the Guangdong Central Bank nor the Hankou Central Bank were consolidated and could not achieve the purpose of their establishment. The third Shanghai Central Bank has reached today's position through Minister Song's painstaking planning. Its domestic credit is remarkable, and its foreign reputation is excellent. The Central Bank is the nation's financial institution, like the blood vessels of the human body. If the financial circulation of a country is smooth, it can enrich the country and strengthen the people. As for how to develop China's economy, how to relieve farmers, and how to revitalize industry, the first step should be (1) to consolidate the foundation of the Central Bank, (2) to develop step by step, and (3) to lead the financial sector to embrace a spirit of unity and cooperation, in order to achieve the goal. Now, under the guidance and assistance of experienced directors and supervisors, I will continue the policies of former President Song and work hard to implement them step by step in order to meet the hopes of all sectors."</p>

<p>After assuming office, President Kong Xiangxi separately convened senior bank officials in the President's office to give instructions and encourage them. At the same time, he received Chinese and foreign guests who came to congratulate him. Mr. Kong said that he did not bring a single personal assistant with him this time, and there were no changes to the entire staff. Many gifts were presented to President Kong by various sectors, all of which were displayed in the President's office.</p>

<p>Promoting the So-Called Security of Shanghai</p>
<p>And Upholding Foreign Interests</p>
<p>Shen Shi Telegraphic News Agency, local news: After the start of the Shanghai war, Matsuoka of Japan once conspired to unite foreigners to promote the so-called "Free City of Shanghai." However, after the extreme opposition of the Chinese people and the reluctance of most foreigners to join, the matter subsided. The Chinese people should be able to remember this. However, although the plan was said to have failed, the Japanese are still actively working secretly. Recently, they colluded with the pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Englishman Hudec, resulting in the realization of the establishment of the "Foreigners' Association" on the 11th. Its name is to promote the so-called "Security of Shanghai" and "Upholding Foreign Interests." The recent visit of Yoshizawa to Shanghai is also closely related to this matter. He recently visited various foreign merchants and was particularly close to Hudec. Hudec is also a member of the association. According to those familiar with the inside story, the association was completely encouraged by the Japanese. The foreigners are merely following suit. What is the intention? This is worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>Should Be Attacked Openly</p>
<p>Ningbo Native Place Association Replies</p>
<p>Letter from the Fisheries Inspection Committee</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports: The Fisheries Hated Goods Inspection Committee, because the treacherous merchants Wang Qingchang, Zhang Afu, and Cao Hongxian are from Ningbo, sent a letter to the Ningbo Native Place Association, asking them to take urgent and effective measures to expel Wang and others from Ningbo, confiscate their property, donate it to support the soldiers on the Northeast front, and erect stone tablets for Wang and others' ancestral graves to expose their treacherous schemes and prevent others from following their example. Yesterday, the Ningbo Native Place Association discussed the three measures and expressed their approval. However, due to the fact that it is a civil organization, it has no right to deal with the execution procedures. The following is a letter from the Yong Association to the Fisheries Inspection Committee: "Dear Sirs, We have received your official letter No. 13. After investigation, we believe that the move to boycott enemy goods originally had the same hatred and showed the spirit of the nation. Only by arranging the steps neatly can it be effective. The merchants are only seeking self-interest and acting as accomplices. Their behavior is very inappropriate and should be attacked openly. However, our association is a civil organization and can only warn the merchants or give them honorary sanctions to promote their awakening. We hereby reply in writing. We hope you will take note of it. Respectfully, Shanghai Fisheries Inspection and Hated Goods Committee."</p>

<p>Shen Shi Telegraphic News Agency, local news: The Chinese people all know that the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast, with airplanes, artillery, blood and flesh flying, is painful and terrible. However, many people are still unaware of the Japanese's deliberate planning and active aggression in my country's marine and aquatic products. In recent years, Japanese fishing boats fishing in our territorial waters have begun to attract attention. Recently, Japanese fish appeared in the fish market of the Shanghai 16th Pier, arousing public anger and various parties are trying to resist it. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency yesterday took a special car to visit Chen Zhongsheng, Director of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration Bureau. He was introduced to a certain expert in my country's fishing industry, who talked about various issues related to Japanese fishing boats invading fishing, which are very important. The record is as follows: Rich in Reserves My Country's Coastal Provinces Are All Long,</p>

The Japanese pirates are in the Northeast, invading the hall. Our central government has expressed its determination to resist Japan. We urge Mr. Ming to come out of the mountain. The messengers are endless. The people of the whole country are especially drawn to it. If you are determined to lead the way and are unwilling to speak of profit, you should lead the people to unite internally, command the brave soldiers, and set up camp on the fort to fight the strong enemy to the death. There will be no one in the world who will disagree with this.

<p>French female aviator Ms. Hilsz, accompanied by engineer Mr. Lemarechal, flew to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning at 6:00, accompanied by Mr. Meriel, the French Consul General in Shanghai, took a car to Hongqiao Airport. After entering the office and inquiring about the weather forecast, the Fox Film Corporation of America first filmed a sound news film, and then inspected the rear wing with the engineer. There were some holes, which were repaired immediately. After slightly starting the engine, she turned west towards the northeast and flew away from Shanghai. More than 70 people from China and France saw her off.</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports: French female aviator Ms. Hilsz's JoeII aircraft arrived in Shanghai yesterday (14th) afternoon and only stayed for 16 hours. She took off in her aircraft at 6:40 this morning (15th) and flew to Seoul, Korea, and then to her final destination, Tokyo. On her return journey, due to Russia's refusal to allow her to pass through Siberia, she plans to follow the original route. If so, she will still pass through Shanghai again. After Ms. Hilsz arrived in Shanghai yesterday, she made a brief speech at the French Concession radio broadcasting station at 6:30. Afterwards, she went to the French Club Stadium for a banquet hosted by the French community. The French Consul General Meriel delivered a speech, and Ms. Hilsz gave a brief reply. Dian Tong News Agency's 15th Seoul dispatch: French female aviator Ms. Hilsz, who departed from Shanghai at 6:40 this morning, was scheduled to arrive in Gyeongseong this afternoon at 3:00, but she was still not seen at the time.</p>
<p>Hilsz (left) repairing the rear wing with the engineer (right) before leaving Shanghai (photographed by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>The officials and people who welcomed her were very worried. She arrived safely at Yeouido Airport at 6:10 PM (outside Gyeongseong).</p>
<p>The total length of the coastline is more than 12,000 li, and fish, shellfish, and algae are abundant. Few countries in the world can compare. To the south, there are warm currents passing through the South China Sea and the East China Sea. To the north, there are cold currents affecting the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea. In addition, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Pearl River Three Major Drainage Areas and the tributaries, organisms reach several thousand species or more can be said to be rich. Jiangsu province alone has a coastline of 1,669 li, and the abundance of aquatic products is the highest in the country. Islands stand like combs, and fishermen line up close. However, due to adhering to old methods, foreigners have coveted it. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has only been conducting investigations of coastal fishing grounds in the past two years. The large-scale new fishing method must change the fishing ground investigation to be clear, and the fish's migration must be understood. The Japanese have long had detailed investigations of my aquatic product areas, and it is difficult to expect them to be made public. Therefore, we must catch up from now on. It is difficult to get a general idea without several years of hard work.</p>
<p>Invasion Ambition Japan's policy of aggression against me has two parts, one is the continental policy of the north, and the other is the marine policy of the south. The former takes the army as the backing, the South Manchuria Railway as the guide, and the occupation of the Northeast as the purpose. The latter takes the navy as the backing, the fishing and shipping industries as the guide, and the occupation of coastal provinces and inland rivers in the interior as the purpose. From an economic point of view, the southern marine aggression policy is more noteworthy for people's livelihood and national defense. The Japanese invasion of fishing in the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province began to show traces at the beginning of the year. Before this, as the former Commercial and Ministry of Commerce Shi Pi and current researcher of the Shimonoseki Joint Aquatic Products Co., Ltd., Kumatato Shiro, inspected the fishing industry in my country's coastal areas every year, dividing it into spring and autumn. The journey has been eighteen or nineteen years. Another example is that the Japanese Kishigami Ryukichi, who died of illness in Sichuan a few years ago, was a professor at the Japanese Empire University and was also a special commissioner to investigate the Yangtze River aquatic products business. Secondly, such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Tokyo Fisheries Training Institute, and the survey and internship ships of the aquatic product test sites in various prefectures and counties also come to my country's coastal areas from time to time, using the survey results to guide their country's fishing industry. Its plan can be said to have obtained Dalian as the root of the North Sea region, Qingdao and the southwestern part of Japan as the base of the Yellow Sea region, and Taiwan as the base of the East China Sea and the South China Sea. There are already many fixed fishing grounds in the Dalian area. In the Qingdao area, the salt fields near Jiaozhou are all in their grasp. However, in Shanghai, there are more people in my country who operate aquatic businesses, and the talents are also more concentrated, making it difficult to get started. Therefore, it is planned to do its best to build a tight fishing wall in Shanghai within a few years. It has been heard that the Japanese government is dispatching guidance personnel in Shanghai. For example, Japanese fishing boats are imported on schedule, and fishing is carried out arbitrarily in nearby seas, all of which are planned and organized. My oppression is also. In addition, in recent years, the Japanese government has encouraged the army and navy to study the fishing industry, and aquatic personnel to complete their studies in the army and navy. The facts are scattered in various magazines and are no longer rare. In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Japanese pirates ran rampant in coastal areas, and they thought it was the most glorious, and the lower Japanese fishing boats have reached more than 30,000. The problems in my country's economic, people's livelihood, and national defense are also serious.</p>
<p>The situation is becoming more urgent The Japanese side is vigorously implementing its marine aggression policy, as described above. Recently, it has become more and more urgent. For example, last year's No. 85 Fudokyu and more than 20 other ships carried out indiscriminate harvesting in the fishing grounds of Huadao Mountain and Shengshan. On one side, the Japanese government commissioned Hirata Yasada, director of the Yokohama Aquarium, to come to Shanghai, using the name of establishing an aquarium to continue the shore-based investigation. In May of the 19th year, the Navy dispatched more than a thousand fishing boats led by warships, and spread them outside Lin Hongkou to fish freely. If they encountered my country's fishing boats, they would arbitrarily invade them and use violence to prevent them. Later, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held the so-called fisheries conference, and the attendees were important figures in the country's aquatic products industry. The resolutions directly affected the development of my country's fishing industry. Those who are indirectly related to my rights and national defense are very large. After that, eight Japanese sea-operated net trawlers, etc., were named cargo ships carrying ice and fresh goods to Shanghai for dumping. All of these were explicit actions. Recently, there are many Japanese foreign firms in Shanghai, all of which are responsible for promoting and assisting the aquatic products business run by the Japanese. There are many conveniences in administration. Therefore, there are Japanese fishing boats in the fishing grounds, and Japanese goods in the market. In addition, the number of Japanese ice and fresh goods imported from Dalian and Qingdao is also increasing day by day. The Shimonoseki Joint Stock Company of Japan has even gone further and cooperated with treacherous merchants in Shanghai to directly import various aquatic products from Japanese ships. Two years ago, more than 30 Japanese fishing boats were imported on schedule. Recently, fresh yellow croaker directly sent and sold by the Japanese was found in the 16th Pier fish market in Shanghai. Regardless of the unscrupulousness of my fishermen and merchants who are willing to sell enemy goods, the steps taken by the Japanese to invade fishing are becoming more and more urgent.</p>
<p>My party's response The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously stated that the situation of Japanese fishing boats invading fishing in my coastal areas was becoming increasingly serious. It had truthfully reported to the Central Government and negotiated with the Japanese side. However, it was always unsuccessful. Therefore, the National Government ordered the customs to restrict foreign ships with less than 100 tons from entering the port of Shanghai in order to avoid danger and resist Japanese fishing boats.

<p>Ascending and Able to Fly into the Clouds</p>
<p>Descending as Fast as a Bullet Leaving the Barrel</p>
<p>Flipping Somersaults with the Plane Facing Down</p>
<p>The Dangerous Scenes Made the Audience Gasp Yesterday</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports: Today (15th), despite the light rain and heavy clouds and bad weather, American aviator Doolittle still drove a Flying Eagle fighter plane to perform at Longhua Fei Bridge Airport in the morning. After starting the motor in the engine room, he drove the plane over a winding road to the center of the airport and took off within three and a half seconds. After crossing the river and returning, he suddenly descended as fast as a bullet leaving the barrel, then skimmed the ground and ascended, disappearing into the clouds. During the initial performance, he repeatedly flew high into the clouds, but also to make it easier for the audience to understand, he made several very dangerous flights at an altitude of 80 to 200 feet. His earliest and most unusual skill was not only to flip the plane, but also to fly upwards with the back of the plane facing the ground. He then tried a slow flight, flying around the airport at a speed of 35 miles per hour at a height of about 30 feet above the ground. Finally, he landed to refuel and then took off again, performing various performances. Shen De, the director of the Hangzhou Miqiao Airport, also visited the site today.</p>
<p>The government and the central government sent personnel together, organized an improved fisheries promotion association, and united fishermen, merchants, and all sectors to fight together. In May of the previous year, the Japanese invasion of fishing plan temporarily came to an end. However, since the 918 Incident, the Shanghai war broke out, and Japanese fishing aggression was launched again. Compulsory fishing incidents occurred from time to time on the coasts of my country. Recently, it has become even more intensified and has invaded my Shanghai market. I deeply hope that the government and the people will cooperate sincerely in order to put a stop to it. However, the fundamental solution lies in improving the education of fishermen and merchants, striving to improve fishing methods, and providing various supports and protections for the fishing industry. Only in this way can my natural and vast resources be sufficiently adopted and maintained, and benefits can be obtained for people's livelihood and national defense.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Recent Tea Industry Improvement and Inspection Guidelines The Commodity Inspection Bureau Expresses Its Views <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, my country's tea exports have decreased year by year, which has a great impact on the finances and rural economy of various parts of my country. Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers visited Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and inquired about the recent tea industry reform and inspection methods. He gave detailed opinions, which are recorded as follows: (The following are Director Cai's opinions)</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the failure of my country's tea industry. The most important ones are that the cultivation and manufacturing methods are too old, and the complex procedures of green tea coloring and tea merchant transactions are also one aspect. Since the bureau started the tea silk import inspection in July of the previous year, in addition to the routine inspection work, the investigation of the tea situation (research is also spared no effort. At the same time, it is recognized that the improvement of cultivation and manufacturing methods is the most important and urgent task at present. Therefore, on the one hand, it is linked to the Hunan Provincial Tea Affairs Experiment Site and the Anhui Provincial Tea Industry Improvement Site, which are responsible for the red and green tea conversion work. , and jointly leased the original site of the Bai Yekeng Zhenzhi Tea Farm in Jiangnan Xiushui, preparing to set up a jointly run tea industry improvement farm. On the one hand, it commissioned mechanical experts to create and improve several red and green tea improvement machines, preparing to divide the methods of red tea withering, fermenting, drying, and fate tea steaming, carving, frying, and rolling into small-scale farmer production equipment and large-scale factory equipment, entrusting them to each improvement farm for separate trials. Although this year is the first phase of trials, it should be able to open up a new path in the tea manufacturing field, so as to greet the private sector, actively transform, and China's tea gardens are all small-scale sideline production. In recent years, due to the sluggish exports, the trees have become old and the mountains have become desolate.</p>
<p>The tea quality has also become inferior due to this. I have also entrusted various improved agencies to engage in the trial voting of tea tree varieties to create new varieties. At a minimum, the tea garden varieties must be pure. It is also planned to try planting Indian and Ceylon tea varieties for comparison. In addition, such items as pruning, fertilizing, and cultivating are also closely related to tea quality and cost, and are also being actively tested. As for the bureau's inspection policy, in the past, only the minimum tea standard and several items such as moisture and ash were set. Since the new tea was launched this year, measures have also been added to crack down on colored tea. The purpose of this item is to crack down on tea leaves with excessive coloring. The bureau has samples available and will distribute them to various tea shops for reference in the future. In addition, it is necessary to prohibit the export of yellow aluminum chromate (commonly known as light yellow), Sanyu Huang Yiji Huang, green arsenic steel gasified copper (commonly known as sand green, etc.) and other toxic coloring materials. If so, the coloring materials that have damaged the tea quality in the past can be gradually reduced, and foreigners can also be prevented from saying that Chinese tea contains harmful substances, making unfavorable publicity for me in various countries. In addition, the set moisture standard is the best way to eliminate the sale of wet tea. In the past, there were many unqualified teas due to slightly higher moisture content. Now, tea merchants in various places are purchasing raw tea and starting to bake it. It is also hoped that they will automatically and strictly crack down on wet tea and add baking to prevent the excellent quality from deteriorating due to moisture. The above-mentioned crackdown measures were decided by the inspection technology conference convened by the Ministry of Industry last month, and will soon be announced by the Ministry of Industry. The bureau can immediately forward it to the Chinese and foreign tea merchants, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Statement from Director Xu of the Public Works Bureau Regarding the Signing of the Provisional Telephone Contract <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the signing of the provisional telephone contract, recent news has been inconsistent, attracting considerable attention from various quarters. Yesterday, newspapers published the draft contract, stating that it had been approved by the Ministry of Transportation and that the approval order arrived in Shanghai on the 13th. It was also reported that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company had agreed to formally sign the contract on the 18th of this month. Reporters, recognizing the importance of this matter, visited Director Xu Peihuang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau to inquire about the truth. According to Director Xu, the Public Works Bureau had long since submitted the draft provisional contract to the Municipal Government for record. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau had also submitted it to the Ministry of Transportation, and the Shanghai Telephone Company had obtained the consent of the authorities of the two concessions. All procedures were ready, and the contract could have been signed earlier. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company had not yet received written permission from the two concessions. More recently, due to stipulations in the contract and related regulations regarding fees payable to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the contract specified "full rental fees and half of the rental fees," without determining the exact amounts. The Shanghai Telephone Company, when negotiating with the two concession authorities, had already declared its fees based on the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's current rental rates. Therefore, without specifying the exact amounts and only stipulating "rental fees and half," they feared future disputes. Consequently, they requested the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to confirm the exact amounts in writing to avoid conflicts. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau recently sought instructions from the Ministry of Transportation regarding this matter. Today's newspaper report that the contract has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation likely refers to this issue and does not mean that the contract itself was only recently approved. Currently, the company has received written permission from the two concession authorities. Once the Shanghai Telephone Bureau delivers the written confirmation of the rental fee amounts to the Shanghai Telephone Company, a signing date can be set. It is expected to occur within the next few days. However, the newspaper report that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company have agreed to formally sign the contract on the 18th of this month is not accurate. This provisional contract is to be signed by the Public Works Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the Shanghai Telephone Company. Therefore, the official signing date should be agreed upon by all three parties. Furthermore, the date of publication of the original contract should also be determined jointly by the three signing parties after the formal signing to ensure due solemnity. The newspaper report that the contract will be officially announced immediately after signing is also inaccurate. Director Xu of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has stated that he will issue a correction regarding all the inaccuracies reported in the news.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Feng Bingnan Explains Transitional Measures in Water Fee Dispute <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Two letters, one from Kui Yanfang, chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, and one from mediator Feng Bingnan, concerning the water issue are of great importance. The original texts are reproduced below:</p>
<p>Letter to Feng Bingnan: Respected Mr. Bingnan, this water dispute is not only related to public health but also affects the lives of users. Our association, as a collective of industries entrusted by the public, has exhausted its efforts but failed to resolve it. Fortunately, your sense of public duty and willingness to mediate have gradually brought the matter within scope, and the temporary transitional measures to resolve the dispute take all aspects into consideration. Not only will all users benefit greatly, but all responsible parties will also be indebted to you. However, the newspaper reports regarding these transitional measures and the trial period, as well as the organization of the advisory committee, are not detailed enough. Therefore, we send this special letter to express our gratitude to you on behalf of all users. We also respectfully request that you provide a detailed explanation of the trial measures so that we can study them and inform the public. We apologize for troubling you and eagerly await your reply. With respectful wishes for your well-being.</p>
<p>Reply to Kui Yanfang: In response to your letter of the 5th of this month, I have carefully reviewed its contents and am grateful for your kind words, which I do not deserve. This water dispute has been ongoing for years without resolution. I, in my ignorance, initially paid no attention to this matter and did not wish to make any suggestions. However, both you and Mr. Hu Jun'an expressed that the dispute was intensifying, that misunderstandings between parties were increasing, and that the delay was causing considerable harm to the citizens. You both requested that I step in to mediate. Recognizing that this matter concerned the livelihood of the people, I agreed to participate in discussions as an independent party, without favoring any side. I also believed that all matters should be discussed face-to-face to avoid misunderstandings. Based on this principle, I proposed that the Public Works Bureau, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and your association each appoint representatives to discuss the matter together. This proposal was accepted by all parties. As a result of the meetings, your association presented a statement, and the Shanghai Waterworks Company presented a table of water price tiers for study. I believed that controlling water wastage was the key to resolving this matter and that whether there was wastage should be determined by whether the necessary water consumption was exceeded. Therefore, I proposed a compromise, stipulating a trial period to estimate the necessary water consumption for each user. If this amount was exceeded, the water fees would be calculated based on the value of the property. During my participation in the discussions and mediation, I was deeply gratified that the members of your association maintained a broad perspective, patiently awaiting a resolution, and did not create further disputes. Now that the proposed trial measures are about to be implemented, I sincerely hope that all members of your association, as well as all citizens, will work together with the Public Works Bureau and the Waterworks Company to control water wastage and reduce the burden of water fees for the citizens. "Wastage" refers to consumption exceeding the necessary amount. Users only need water for drinking and cleaning purposes, and these purposes do not require wastage. If all users understand this and completely eliminate water wastage, the reduction in water fees will be considerable. Regarding the points you inquired about in your letter, in addition to what has already been explained above, I provide further point-by-point answers for clarity: (1) The current proposed water price is for a certain amount of water, which is based on the current total water meter readings in other houses and then increased by a substantial amount to determine the necessary water consumption. (2) The newly proposed water price table is sufficient to meet the needs of users for good hygiene, and the water price calculation does not exceed 75% of the property value. If the above water consumption is exceeded, additional water fees will be charged for the extra water. The method for calculating these extra water fees will vary based on the property level. For houses with the lowest rent, the price is 1.71 hao per thousand gallons; for houses with the highest rent, the price is 7.5 li per thousand gallons. (3) Water fees are calculated based on rent. The categorization has already been listed in the table, which is attached. (4) The new water price table has been approved by the Public Works Bureau. Although its effective period has not been specified, during this trial period, a more accurate statistic of the necessary water consumption for household use should be obtained. In addition, the Waterworks Company has two more points that I was previously asked to convey to your association: (1) The company is willing to do its best to assist the members of your association in controlling water wastage. (2) The company derives no benefit from the renewal contract with the Public Works Bureau for the universal installation of water meters. It is only seeking to benefit all citizens of the concession. This letter is sent in reply, hoping for your attention. The water fee calculation table is listed below:</p>
<p>| Monthly Rent (甲) | Monthly Allotment of Water (乙) | Monthly Estimated Usage per Household | Excess Water Fee per Thousand Gallons | Gallon Unit |</p>

<p>The Jiangzhe Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Ministry of Industries, in compliance with orders, began collecting fees yesterday. The previous evening, Dai Yongtang cordially invited various leaders of the fishing industry to a banquet at Dajilou. More than sixty people attended, including Zhang Shenzhi, Zhen Zhenxin, Xin Fanseng, Zhou Meiting, Xu Yifei, Lin Meiqing, Ge Quan, Shun Jiacai, Jin Chuxiang, Huang Zhensheng, Ru Jingmin, Zhang Zhisheng, Zhu Bao, and Wu Xintai. Chen Qibo, head of the General Affairs Section, and Hu Hu, head of the Collection Section of the office, were responsible for hospitality. During the banquet, Zhou Jianyin, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Industries, delivered a speech, outlining the following: (1) the process of exempting the heavy fisheries tax; (2) the rationale for changing the fisheries tax to a fisheries construction fee; (3) the power to collect, manage, distribute, and audit rests with the Fisheries Improvement Committee, in which members of the fisheries industry constitute a majority; (4) the new construction of two patrol ships for protecting the seas and the thoroughness of other planning. Subsequently, the guests expressed their support for the method of collecting the fisheries construction fee at one percent of the value. Collection Director Dai Yongtang then gave a speech of thanks, sincerely describing the twists and turns of this case and the future direction of the facilities. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM on a joyful note.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chamber of Commerce Explains Silver Coin Names After Implementation of the Abolition of the Tael System <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Insurance Association, requested clarification on the names of silver coins after the abolition of the tael system to ensure uniformity. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately provided an interpretation based on the laws, stating that the term "silver coin" should be used. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Letter from the Insurance Association <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, We received your letter of March 17, stating that according to the Ministry's order, all account books, contracts, and newly issued loans should uniformly use the silver coin standard from the date of the order, and the use of silver taels is no longer permitted. We have notified our colleagues to comply accordingly. However, although this matter is now universally implemented in the market, the name of the silver coin has not yet been clearly stipulated by the Ministry's order. Whether the name "silver coin" will be officially adopted in the future, or whether names such as "national currency," "silver dollar," or "silver ocean" can still be used according to previous custom, and whether they can be used arbitrarily, all require clarification. At the beginning of this currency system reform, if a consistent name is not specified, there will be inconveniences in the future, as the names used in the account books and contracts of various industries will differ. In view of the foregoing, we respectfully request that your association submit this matter for discussion and determine a standard name for universal use in all industries. We eagerly await your decision. Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>We received your letter regarding the name after the abolition of the tael system, whether the name "silver coin" should be officially adopted, or whether names such as "national currency," "silver dollar," or "silver ocean" can still be used, and requesting a discussion to determine a standard name. The term "national currency" refers to currency other than foreign currency, and its types include silver, copper, silver dollars, and silver oceans. These two terms are also used without consideration. Considering the need for a unified name, the decision should be limited to terms that are legally based. The recently promulgated Silver Standard Coinage Regulations by the government refer to the existing one-dollar silver coin as simply "silver coin," and the new silver coin to be minted is called "silver standard coin." Therefore, the term "silver coin" has become a legal name. Your association may notify your colleagues to uniformly change the name to "silver coin" to achieve consistency. We hope you will consider this. Addressed to the Shanghai Insurance Association.</p>

Must not privately open for business until a complete solution is obtained. 4. All external and internal affairs must not be acted upon privately. If there are opinions, they can be reported to the representatives and submitted for public discussion and implementation. 5. All negotiation expenses shall be shared jointly by all and must not be shirked. 6. There must be no withdrawal midway or undermining of unity. 7. If any business is sued for resisting the tax or arrested by the patrol, mutual assistance should be provided and must not be shirked to show unity. 8.

<h3 id="e135">Third Business Meeting <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>More than 40 representative businesses of all bicycle shops in the French Concession convened the third meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Ji Hongnian was publicly elected as chairman. Representatives Li Fengting, Li Zichuan, Xu Ruoyu, Han Baotai, Wang Chunfang, Wang Chongxing, Jiang Qiansheng, Xu Jin, Chen Zhongqing, Zhu Jinzhi, and others reported on the progress of negotiations with various parties. After the reports, it was resolved: (1) to unanimously reject the method of reduction of donations by the French authorities and Cheng Zhusun, chairman of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, and to report that they would reject even one li or one fen of illegal harsh taxes; (2) to send another letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, detailing the situation of suffering and pointing out that, according to the promise of the former French consul, no other donations would be levied after the increase of the 14 patrol donations. Moreover, after the increase of patrol donations, the French Municipal Council was expected to be able to meet expenses, so the donation for protection was changed from 10% to 13%. Unexpectedly, a classified business donation was created afterwards. This business donation should not have been levied either. Now, the levy of special donations is completely unreasonable. The association should, according to reason, negotiate with the French Municipal Council to cancel the donations. (3) To support the Chinese Taxpayers Association: all matters related to Chinese in the future must be approved or recognized by the association before they can be implemented. Otherwise, it would violate the association's previous principle of mediation to increase donations. (4) To investigate the business reports of each bicycle shop that has had its water and electricity suspended by the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company, and to submit a list requesting negotiations. Also, to send a letter questioning the Water and Electricity Company: the bicycle shops do not lack water and electricity fees, so why cut off water and electricity? Who should be responsible for the responsibility and losses? Please reply. (5) The citywide business meeting decided to hold the inaugural meeting of the Bicycle Industry Association at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association at 1:00 PM on the 20th of this month. All businesses that are suspending operations in the French Concession will participate and request assistance to show unified action. (6) If necessary, the citywide businesses will hold a parade. (7) If necessary, submit a request to the central national government or go to Beijing to petition. After the above resolutions were discussed and passed, all were approved and the businesses were handed over to eleven responsible representatives for separate implementation. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Chinese Workers Dismissed from American Merchant Ships Seek Severance Pay <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Seamen Account for 80% of Dismissals</p>
<p>Organize Appeal to the Maritime Party Branch for Assistance</p>
<p>American merchant shipping companies, including the United States Mail Steamship Company, etc., had previously dismissed all their Chinese seamen in order to rescue and maintain the lives of American workers, as the government ordered, due to the increasing number of unemployed American workers in the midst of the global economic panic. Therefore, after receiving the order, the companies have successively dismissed Chinese workers starting this year, accounting for 80% of the total. It is now known that the dismissed workers believe that there is no reason for the dismissal, so they have jointly reported to the Seamen's Union, which has forwarded the request to the Special Maritime Party Branch of China for assistance. At the same time, they have organized the "Appeal Association of Dismissed Chinese Workers from American Merchant Ships" to unite and discuss countermeasures. It is said that what the association is asking for is that each dismissed worker should be given considerable severance pay by the company, depending on the number of years of service, to provide funds for seeking other jobs. They do not hope to be reinstated, as they know that the dismissal of Chinese workers by the company was ordered by the government, and it is impossible to reverse the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e139">The Eighth District Party Headquarters Requests Exemption from Sampan Monthly Dues <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>There are more than one hundred sampans in Wusong, specializing in ferrying passengers. The boatmen are mostly poor and their income is barely enough to make a living. After the January 28th Incident, they suffered severe losses, and their post-war lives are desolate, making it difficult for them to make ends meet. They are unable to afford the license fees and monthly dues levied by the municipal government. They once petitioned the Eighth District Party Headquarters to negotiate with the municipal government for a reduction. The municipal government stated that the license fees were solely for the actual cost of issuing licenses, and the monthly dues were already at the lowest rate and could not be reduced further. The boatmen, who survived the calamity, find it difficult to survive while burdened with these dues. Recently, the Eighth District Party Headquarters has petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters to negotiate with the municipal government for the exemption of Wusong sampan monthly dues for this year to provide some relief. If approved, it would greatly benefit the sampan owners.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Resolution of the Rent Increase Dispute in Fengyu Lane <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Fengyu Lane houses on Pousse Road in the French Concession are owned by the Chinese Dali Company and managed by lawyer Qiu Fenling as the rental agent. As the houses have been built for eight years, the original rent was not high. This time, an abrupt notice was issued, increasing the rent by 20-30%, which was opposed by the tenants. The negotiations between the two parties lasted for more than a month. It is now reported that the tenants publicly elected Tong Lizhang as their representative to request concessions from the landlord. The landlord has agreed to make a reduction and moderately increase the rent, with a standard increase of two yuan per room, implemented simultaneously within the lane. The tenants in the market houses have no objection, so the matter has been peacefully resolved.</p>

<p>Expansion of the Announcement Area</p>
<p>Addition of a Courtroom</p>
<p>Guo Yun'guan, President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, previously jointly established a bi-institutional daily with the Second Branch of the High Court to facilitate litigation for the people. After its discontinuation, notices and announcements were posted in the announcement area for the public to read. Now, because the original wall area was insufficient, the announcement area has been greatly expanded to include the entire wall outside the court, and it has been categorized to make it easy for people to understand at a glance. In addition, President Guo felt that the existing thirteen courtrooms were still insufficient, so he converted a room opposite New Star, formerly used as a lawyer's lounge, into a courtroom. It has now been fully renovated and furnished, and named the Fourteenth Courtroom, specializing in hearing civil cases. Although the room is small, the air is sufficient. As for the damaged walls, windows, and doors in the court, they have all been repaired by hired workers, and all places have been painted and brushed, making them look brand new. Recently, due to the Western New Year, the police have suspended the delivery of criminal public prosecution cases, so the court has felt a little quieter, and the number of vehicles entering and leaving has suddenly decreased. Guo took advantage of this opportunity to repair the dilapidated pavement in the courtyard, hiring many workers to repair it day and night, aiming to complete the work before Monday next week.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Trial of a Large Group of Robbers <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Department, and detective Shan Zhaoxian, previously arrested robbers Chen Youming, Wu Xingchang, Li Xiaowu, Xia Changfa, Chen Shengcai, Xing Fusheng, Xing Baoxiang, Wu Jinfa, Shen Wenqing, Zhang Xiaofu, Yang Qing'san, Zhou Shenhai, and the woman Sun Shao'shi, etc., seized two pistols and twelve bullets, and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court for trial and detention. After investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of this case, it was found that the defendants had been involved in armed robberies between December of last year and February 9th of this year, robbing Liu Genying at No. 147 Zhoujia Road, Huang Zongbang at No. 191 Linqing Road, the monk Pan in a bungalow on Meizhou Road, Chen Liu'shi at No. 781 Xinzha Road, Zhou A'fu at No. 175 Qiwupu Road, and other households of gold jewelry and clothing worth over 700 yuan. Part of the original stolen goods was recovered. Yesterday, the police escorted the defendants to the First Special Court for continued trial by Judge Wu Zehan. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case, stating that defendant Yang Qing'san is currently in the hospital suffering from severe typhoid fever, which is life-threatening. According to the doctor, unless there is a major change, treatment will take three weeks before he can appear in court. Therefore, a postponement is requested. Defendant Sun Shao'shi hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested bail pending trial. The police lawyer opposed, saying that defendant Sun Shao'shi is actually a key criminal who helped the robbers carry pistols privately during the robberies, so bail cannot be agreed to. After Judge Wu questioned the defendants briefly, he ordered them to be returned to custody separately for a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Fire in Yangjing Town, Pudong <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>—A Total of Seven Houses Were Burned Down—</p>
<p>Shen Hengxing Oil Mill, No. 1 Youche Street, South End of the Central Market, Yangjing Town, Pudong, is owned by Shen Shunying, a local resident. Shen is old, so the business is managed by his eldest son, Jin Jin. Shen's second son, Quan Duo, died six years ago, leaving behind a wife, Sheng, 40 years old, and a son, Xingyuan, 20 years old. Xingyuan married a Jia girl two years ago. However, because the rooms in the oil mill were insufficient for accommodation, three new bungalows were built across the street last year, specifically for Xingyuan and his wife to live in. Recently, Xingyuan went to Hangzhou to purchase goods, and his wife also returned to Ningbo, so the house was uninhabited. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, when the old clerk in the oil mill got up to work, he suddenly saw thick smoke and flames shooting out of the empty house. He quickly realized that the interior was ablaze and impossible to extinguish. He urgently reported to the police and called for help. The fire quickly spread to the roof and then to the adjacent Xisongji Winery, and the fire became even more intense, making it difficult to control for a while. Soon, the Yangjing Fire Brigade drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. After a while, the Pudong District Fire Brigade of Lan'ni Du Dongchang Road received the alarm and also drove a pumper truck to help put out the fire. The fire burned until dawn, burning down the three empty bungalows where Xingyuan lived, three houses in the winery, and a large oil mill basket shed and warehouse one after another. The fire gradually went out. The fire trucks stopped extinguishing the fire at around 7:00 AM. After the fire was extinguished, the police and members of the Security Corps who were maintaining order at the scene studied the cause of the fire. They all could not understand how the fire started since the house was empty and uninhabited.</p>

<p>Gong Ziliang, a 35-year-old resident of Songjiang, worked as a driver for the China General Omnibus Company. He married a Wang woman many years ago. Recently, Gong met a young woman, Qian, outside, and they became deeply attached to each other. He then imitated the family of Qi people and set up a small family at No. 860 Yingxun Road, Lukia浜, Nanshi. Unexpectedly, there was no harmony of Qi people. After his wife, Wang, found out, she often stirred up a storm of jealousy, and the family had no peace. The day before yesterday, a major disturbance occurred between the two women. Seeing this situation, Gong deeply regretted his self-inflicted disaster and self-seeking trouble. In a moment of anger, he ingested raw opium and lay in bed waiting to die. He groaned incessantly when the poison took effect, and he died before he could be rescued. He died at Qian's place, so when Wang learned of her husband's death, she rushed to the scene crying and making a scene, so the police took both of them to the police station for questioning. During the interrogation, both women were crestfallen and secretly shedding tears, but it was too late. The director then summoned the head of the 27th Ward, Tao Rong, to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Zheng and others arrived at the scene to conduct the autopsy and ordered the body to be collected.</p>

At around 1:00 PM yesterday, while walking along Avenue Foch, he was suddenly hit by a car that came out of a side street. Chen, being a villager, was unfamiliar with the traffic rules of Shanghai and did not know the distinction between the upper and lower lanes. As a result, he was knocked down by the car and seriously injured. Police officer No. 2883, who heard the news, rushed to the scene, recorded the car number, and immediately sent the injured man to the Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Chen's injuries are too severe and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>—Shot and Killed While Leaning Against a Fence—</p>
<p>Zhang A'yan, a resident of Shaoxing, lived at No. 7 Taipingfang, Hongzhen. He had a son named Zhang A'cai, 19 years old, who worked at the Yicheng Peng Grain Store on Broadway Road. A week ago, he had a quarrel with the young owner of the Rongqing Bicycle Shop. Later, they each invited gangsters to mediate and settle the matter. The young owner, being in the wrong, offered wine as an apology. At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, the young owner came and invited A'cai out, but he did not return until late. At around 12:00 AM, someone was suddenly shot and killed on the bamboo fence of the Youlian Film Company on East Tiyu Road, Zhabei. Shen Fengqi of the company heard the gunshot and went out to see. He vaguely saw four people running away. The murdered person was leaning against the bamboo fence and had already died. At that time, it was unknown who it was. He immediately reported to the police chief of the Baziqiao Police Station in the Fifth District. The police arrived and found a business card of Yicheng Peng Grain Store near the deceased. They immediately sent the police to summon the Zhang family from the store, who identified the deceased as Zhang A'cai. They then informed his father, who arrived at the scene and cried bitterly, and recounted a series of events. In addition to reporting to the headquarters, the police station ordered Wang Jinfu, the local guarantor of the 91st district, to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Zheng Qinming, coroner Xuan Zhiming, and others arrived at the scene. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers, with a white twill short shirt and trousers underneath. The bullet entered the lung through the left breast and did not exit. He was definitely captured and shot at point-blank range. The family members were ordered to collect the body and await the investigation of the murderers and their arrest and prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e149">The Case of the Murder of the Young Owner of Qian Feng Tai Incense Shop <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Incident Seemed to Be a Shooting During a Wallet Robbery</p>
<p>The Manager Chen Qiancheng's Injuries Are Critical</p>
<p>At 9:45 PM the night before last, Chen Zhikui, the young owner of Qian Feng Tai Incense Shop, No. 52 Rue du Pont, French Concession, a native of Ningbo, was shot and killed by thugs when he returned to the shop from outside and walked into the small alley next door. Chen Qiancheng, the manager of the shop, was also shot three times and went to Renji Hospital for treatment. The police sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Yanshi Office to await an autopsy. The details of the incident have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The details of the incident are as follows: That night, the deceased, Chen Zhikui, sent goods to Hongkou and returned to the shop by rickshaw for a short rest. He then left the shop and wanted to go to his home upstairs, detouring to the small alley next to the north. As he stepped into the alley, a man in a jacket followed Chen behind. Chen turned around and asked where he was going. The man replied that he was going upstairs to look for Wang Liutang. The remaining rooms on the upper floor of the shop had been rented to Wang Liutang and his wife in September of last year for 16 yuan per month. Wang was a gangster. Chen did not pay attention because he heard that he was looking for Wang. He took about two or three steps forward and met his 11-year-old sister, Lin Di. Chen asked his sister where she was going. His sister replied that her mother had sent her to buy cigarettes. Chen also asked his sister to buy a pack of cigarettes and took out a cigarette and handed it to the person behind him. He then touched his wallet behind him (containing about 70-80 yuan in cash) to get money for his sister. Unexpectedly, the wallet was suddenly lost. Chen suspected that the person behind him had stolen it. He turned around and asked him to return the wallet, saying that he could treat him if he returned the wallet. The man replied that he had not stolen his wallet. But Chen suspected that he wanted to search his body. At this time, the man took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired at Chen. The bullet hit his throat. The murderer turned around and fled out of the alley. Chen, who was shot, spurted blood and chased out of the alley, shouting for help. After leaving the alley, he ran south to the corner of the vegetable market street and collapsed in front of the Nanhuo store and died. At this time, Chen Qiancheng, the manager of the store, heard the shouts of the young owner and saw the blood flowing from his throat, and saw the murderer running north. He chased after him, but was shot three times by the murderer, hitting his right shoulder, right leg, and lower abdomen. He fell to the ground. The murderer then fled into Baoyu Lane. The colleagues in the Qian Feng Tai store hired a car to send Qiancheng to the hospital for treatment first. The police were alerted and immediately sent detectives to round up the murderer, but he had disappeared. The body was then transported to the Yanshi Office. Yesterday morning, the police reported to the Second Special Court to assign Prosecutor Deng, forensic doctor Jiang Xuan, and secretary Zhao Yifen to the office to examine the body, ascend to the court, and according to the testimony of witness Hong Xiangxian (a clerk in Qian Feng Tai), and Chen Chen, the mother of the deceased, requested to arrest the murderer and seek redress. Deng decreed that Chen Zhikui had been shot and killed, and the body was collected by the family members. The police station will arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. It is reported that Chen Qiancheng is now in critical condition in the hospital. Chen Tingchun, the father of the deceased, is still in Hankou. The store has sent a telegram urging him to come to Shanghai to take care of the funeral affairs.</p>

<p>Dr. Muehlens of Germany is an expert in the study of tropical diseases. He is a scholar with deep knowledge and one of the leading scholars in Europe. He is currently a professor at the University of Hamburg in Germany and the director of the Tropical Disease Research Institute. The League of Nations has hired him to come to China to investigate health matters. He arrived in Shanghai on the 10th of this month. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Nanjing Health Department, specially entrusted Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, and Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau, to entertain him.

<h3 id="e151">Lin Ronghan Invents Magnetic Sheet Photography <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Photos are Printed on Magnetic Sheets</p>
<p>Never Fade or Change Color</p>
<p>According to Shenshi Telegraph News Agency's local news, Mr. Lin Ronghan, a Cantonese who served as the Director of the Automobile Transportation Department of the 19th Route Army during the January 28th Incident, is well-versed in photographic art. In view of the lack of photographic burning techniques on Chinese porcelain sheets and image printing on Fuzhou lacquerware, and the fact that porcelain photos on the market are all hand-painted and then burned, so it is uncertain whether they resemble the original. It is even more difficult to make artistic photos with complex backgrounds. In view of this, Mr. Lin has been working hard for four or five years and has finally succeeded. From now on, photos can be directly printed on porcelain sheets, which are exactly the same as the original photos. After the film is printed, it is burned at a very high temperature, so that the photo penetrates into the porcelain plate. Even if it is washed with water or scraped with a knife, it will not fade or change color. Once the photo is printed on this porcelain sheet, it can be permanently preserved, avoiding the risk of contamination and discoloration.

<h3 id="e153">Responsibility Statement on Meat Inspection Detention Cases in the Freight Industry <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team Notifies to Detain at Any Time</p>
<p>Expresses Helplessness to the Guild</p>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau's implementation of inspection and detention of cured ham and goods has been strongly opposed by the two industries. Recently, it has also aroused the dissatisfaction of various industry associations, providing strong assistance to the two industries of cured ham. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Although this case has been presented to the Executive Yuan by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on behalf of both industries for instructions, there has been no reply to date. Now, the freight industry and Datong Company, etc., have stated that because the ham and cured meat they transport have been detained for a long time, they are afraid that the goods will be damaged, and they have a heavy responsibility. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the ham industry association stating everything, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Statement of the Freight Association <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>To: The case of the Tongli Company and other freight companies states that, for the case of the Shanghai Health Bureau's import inspection of meat, the ham industry is striving to abolish it. Recently, our company and others have transported more than one hundred pieces of ham and wind meat from Hangzhou to Shanghai. Because each ham shop refuses to accept it before the definite resolution, it is now stored in the road bureau freight yard and in the open air. It is still difficult to predict when it will be delivered. Each ham shop has been notified that the storage fees will be recognized in accordance with the regulations, but if this solution is indefinitely, it will be stacked for a long time. If it happens to be rotted, rat-injured, etc., our company will be difficult to bear this heavy responsibility. It is specially requested to forward the letter to the Shanghai Ham Industry Association and inform each shop to check. In the future, if the above-mentioned accidents occur in the stacked goods, each ham shop shall be responsible for itself. Our company and others will not be responsible for anything else except for handling the stacking. Please forward it, and it will be impossible to thank you, etc. The goods carried by our industry have always been delivered immediately after the goods arrive, which is a fixed procedure. This time, each ham shop has not been able to pick up the arrived goods due to the unresolved meat import inspection, which is a special situation. However, if it is delayed for a long time, it will cause damage. The responsibility issue in this regard should also be declared in advance to avoid disputes. The reason for the letter is as stated above. Correspondingly, the letter is hereby forwarded. All goods have been delayed for a long time, resulting in damage, and our industry cannot be responsible. Please check with your association, forward it to each shop, and wait for a reply.</p>

<p>To: At 4:00 PM today, the water patrol team came with a letter from the Health Bureau, stating that all imported salted meat and ham from each shop are not allowed to be picked up without inspection, and our company is responsible for detaining them at any time. Otherwise, our company will be asked to pick up the goods, etc. Our company has been in contact with your association for many years, and the relationship is very close. Since the inspection occurred, inspectors have come here to discuss it. Our company believes that it is difficult to detain goods due to business concerns. Please forgive us. Now we are notified by the water police that detention for inspection is imperative. Since this responsibility is assigned to our company, we are helpless. We specially inform your association and quickly forward it to your colleagues to check, so as to avoid misunderstandings. April 13th,</p>

<h3 id="e158">Petition to the Municipal Government by Ship-Dwelling Refugees on the Zhabei Suzhou Creek <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, more than 30 representatives, including Gao Longyou, were sent by the ship-dwelling refugees on the Suzhou Creek to the Municipal Government with a petition. Mr. Xu, a clerk from the Second Section of the Municipal Government, received them. The representatives detailed their suffering under the strict ban and requested the Water Patrol to postpone enforcement, etc. Mr. Xu replied that he would submit the petition to the mayor for review and then relay the instructions back to the ships. The original text of the petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>We, the refugees, humbly submit this petition. Due to years of unusual drought in our hometowns, we had no means of survival and were forced to sell our land and buy boats, bringing our elderly and young children to Shanghai to live on small boats along the banks of the Suzhou Creek. We use the boats as homes, temporary precarious nests. The men pull rickshaws, the women reel silk, and some even do the most arduous labor. Now, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has requested the government to issue an order to immediately ban our ship-dwelling, leaving us with no food to return and in violation of orders if we stay. We have no money to move ashore or rent houses, and selling our boats would leave us temporarily homeless, virtually trapping us in a desperate situation. We believe that even in times of war and chaos, those without homes on land or water could still find refuge. Now, in this unified world, we cannot even allow these destitute people to live in temporary peace. Those with benevolence should not bear to see this. We have long admired your government's compassionate heart and its commitment to the welfare of the common people. Therefore, we have sent representatives to your government to seek your consideration and beg for relief measures and a postponement of the ban, so that we can find a way to relocate without being forced into desperation. We will be eternally grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Special Article: Biography of Mr. Ye Chengzhong <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Ye Chengzhong, also known as Chengzhong, was from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. His mother's surname was Hong, and his father was called Zhiyu, who was a farmer.</p>
<p>When he was six years old, his father died. He had two brothers, and they depended on their mother, but the family was extremely poor, with only a dilapidated house left. The mother and sons were constantly threatened by hunger and cold. When he was nine years old, he was able to attend school, but he dropped out after only half a year due to poverty. This fact gave his young mind a strong stimulation. From then on, he understood the difficulty for poor children to acquire knowledge, and at the same time, he experienced the pain of poor children dropping out of school. This understanding and experience were the distant cause of his later founding of the Chengzhong Mongolian School.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven, he entered a neighboring oil mill as a worker. After three years, he quit because the treatment was too harsh. After leaving the oil mill, life was even harder, even without means of survival. Mr. Ni, a fellow villager, pitied his plight and respected his sincerity, so he invited him to Shanghai. At that time, the travel expenses from Zhenhai to Shanghai were only 2,000 yuan, but even these 2,000 yuan were obtained by his mother mortgaging the autumn rice in the field. This difficult situation and hardship was the driving force for his later efforts to achieve success.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Ni recommended him to work as an apprentice in a grocery store in the French Concession. At this time, it was after the Opium War, and the imperialists had used warships to open the door of our country. Shanghai had also been opened as a commercial port. Foreign merchant ships gathered in the Huangpu River. Every morning, he would drive a small boat, loaded with groceries, and sell them to foreign merchant ships, and after returning to the store, he had to sweep and cook. He had no rest for a moment all day. He spent three years in this state of life, and then quit because of the shopkeeper's stupidity. At this time, he was already seventeen years old. Three years of apprenticeship had given him a slight understanding of how to make a living, and further determined his determination to live independently. So this time he left the grocery store was the starting point of his independent life, and also the beginning of his career.</p>
<p>After leaving the grocery store, he still drove a small boat, shouting and selling in the Huangpu River. He was as hardworking and enduring as he was in the store before. After a long time, he learned the skills of doing business. More importantly, he understood that the ships gathered in the Huangpu River were all weapons for invading China. This understanding was a turning point in his thinking, and made him make a great wish to repair the loopholes and regain the rights and interests.</p>
<p>In 1826, that is, the first year of Tongzhi in the former Qing Dynasty, he tried his best to raise funds and began to set up a small store in Hongkou. In the winter of that year, he moved to Outer Hongkou. The small-scale operation naturally yielded very meager profits. However, he was able to be hardworking and enduring internally, and to treat people with sincerity externally, building up credit in the market. In this way, his business became more and more prosperous, and the scale also expanded. The small store in Outer Hongkou, which was limited in scale, had branches all over the country in a few years. Mr. Ye, who was formerly poor and unable to support himself, had now become a powerful leader in the national business community. This success was naturally due to his diligence, thrift, self-discipline, honest treatment of others, and extraordinary talent and energy. "Where there is a will, there is a way." Who says Mr. Ye's success was accidental?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Ye's true success is more than that, and his true career is not limited to that, because he realized that in order to repair the loopholes and regain the rights and interests, commercial competition was still the second step, and the most important thing was to revitalize domestic industry. Only by revitalizing industry can we resist the invasion of foreign products, and only by revitalizing industry can we engage in commercial competition. Therefore, he founded match factories and silk reeling factories in Shanghai and Hankou on a large scale. This was our country's early match industry and silk reeling industry. In fact, at that time, although the capitalist advanced countries in Europe had developed into imperialism and were intensifying the opening and competition for overseas markets, China, which was stagnating in the agricultural economy, was their target of competition. However, at that time, the power of the capitalist powers in China was still very weak, and the foundation was not yet stable. If we could take advantage of this time to rise up and reform, it would not be too late. The Meiji Restoration movement in Japan in 1868 was a good example. However, the Qing government at that time was never able to realize it, and although there was the "Hundred Days' Reform" in 1898, it ultimately failed due to the oppression of the old forces. From then on, the imperialists' attack on our country became more and more fierce, and their power in China also grew stronger. Under this situation, our country's agricultural economy was increasingly collapsing, and the national industry was unable to lift its head due to the imperialists' constraints. In the process of continuous decay and collapse and continuous infringement, China finally fell into a semi-colonial status, which it has not been able to extricate itself from to this day. This may be something that Mr. Ye did not expect at first. However, it is precisely for this reason that Mr. Ye's vision is even more remarkable.</p>
<p>Secondly, what deserves our attention most in Mr. Ye's career is that he "accumulates wealth and is able to distribute wealth." He is not used by money, not burdened by money, and can make the society's money still be used for the society. In his later years, he built the Huaide Hall to shelter orphans and widows, the Zhongxiao Hall to shelter relatives, and set up charity schools and smallpox bureaus to shelter the very poor. Other projects such as promoting academies, dredging water conservancy, managing roads, repairing bridges, building the Chongyi Association and the Guangyi Association, and providing disaster relief to the provinces of Feng, Jin, Yu, Yan, Lu, Su, and Zhe, he made generous donations to all. Among them, what we should particularly mention is the establishment of this school.</p>
<p>This school, Chengzhong Middle School, was originally called Chengzhong Mongolian School. Due to the stimulation of dropping out of school at a young age, Mr. Ye donated 28 acres of land in Zhangjiawan, Hongkou, and 100,000 taels of silver to found Chengzhong Mongolian School, so that poor children could have the opportunity to study. When the construction plan was about to begin, Mr. Ye suddenly fell ill and died. Before he died, he repeatedly told his family members, "After I die, you must complete my ambition to found the Mongolian School." He also left a letter to the school directors Fan Fen and Chen Zuli, saying, "Chengzhong was poor and orphaned, and regrets that he dropped out of school. He has long wanted to establish a school to help poor children. The matter is just beginning, but the end is approaching. Gentlemen, we have known each other for a long time and must be able to understand my humble wishes and work together to accomplish this." This was in 1899, that is, the 25th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>The following year, in 1900, Mr. Ye's son, Yijian, inherited his father's will and donated another 100,000 taels of silver. In 1902, Mr. Yizhao, Yiming, Yiquan, Yiqi, Yiyong, and Yiyu also jointly donated 100,000 taels of silver. The school building started construction in 1900 (September of the 26th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty) and was completed in 1901 (January of the 27th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty). The school opened on April 16 of the same year (February 28 of the 27th year of Guangxu). This is the origin of this school, and it is also Mr. Ye's greatest and immortal career. We, the faculty and students of this school, look up to the portrait of Mr. Ye Chengzhong today and recall that nine-year-old child who dropped out of school due to poverty, the eleven-year-old child who worked in the oil mill, and the young man who drove a small boat and shouted and sold in the Huangpu River. His lifelong hard work has given us the opportunity to study today. How should we work hard and how should we be diligent in order to live up to Mr. Ye Chengzhong's original wishes? Look, isn't Mr. Ye Chengzhong's portrait urging us every day, morning and evening, and expecting us?</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chengzhong's life is synonymous with struggle. His success is due to his willingness to struggle. He has a torch-like vision and boiling enthusiasm. His career and his personality can never be praised by the "feather decorations," "second-rank official hats," "Grand Master Ronglu," or other irrelevant honorary titles after his death. The founding of this school alone is enough for him to be immortal.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chengzhong was born on July 18, 1840 (June 20 of the Gengzi year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty) and died on November 5, 1899 (October 3 of the Yihai year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty). Chen Binhe, 32nd anniversary of the founding of Chengzhong Middle School.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, On the 14th, my lawyer acted as an agent for Huang Zhou in the case of Huang Zhou suing Xi Longsheng for confirmation of mother and son. During the debate, the two lawyers, Li, listed as witnesses in Huang Zhou's statement, are now also acting as agents for the defendant Xi Longsheng. Therefore, they are exercising the duties of lawyers in the position of witnesses, which conflicts with the obligations and responsibilities that witnesses should fulfill. There is a risk of bias. Article 32 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that judges should recuse themselves from performing duties in litigation cases in which they have been litigation agents, witnesses, or appraisers. The state's restrictions on the exercise of duties by court staff are so strict, let alone lawyers who are specialized professionals. Therefore, my lawyer advocates stopping the agency rights of the two lawyers, Li and Qin, in this case. If a witness acts as a lawyer, then the lawyer is an employee. As long as there is a public fee, the lawyer will do everything possible to defend the interests of the client, and it is inevitable that he will be biased. This was the original intention of my lawyer's debate at the time. However, your newspaper only stated, "Lawyer Zhang also said that a lawyer is an employee. As long as he is given money, he will do anything." This is a distorted and untrue statement, and should be corrected to avoid misunderstanding. I hereby request that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column for correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Shewo, April 15.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I have just read the news in your newspaper that "the city will switch to automatic telephones," which states that it will "benefit all users in the city, the cost will not increase, and a temporary contract will be signed on the 18th." This was not mentioned at the time, and I am afraid it will cause misunderstanding. I am hereby sending a letter to request a correction. To the Editor, Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, April 15.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Regarding the Discussion Letters on the Question of "Can One Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>(9) Letter from Wei Mingjun of Nanjing: Speaking of the Youth's Way Out from the Rural Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Reporter, I have some simple opinions regarding the question of "returning to the countryside." I request your guidance. To answer the question "Can one return to the countryside?", we should first clearly ask "Why do we want to return to the countryside?" By recognizing the essence of the problem, we can avoid answering the wrong question and provide a relatively correct answer. According to Mr. Xiongsheng's original intention, because in the city he is "suffering from the most fashionable disease: unemployment, and feeling the pain of having no confidence in finding a job," he raised a question: "Can one return to the countryside and find the most appropriate and possible way to make a living?" From this, we know that Mr. Xiongsheng, who wants to return to the countryside, has the same reason as the peasants who left the countryside: they are forced and driven by the ruthless reality of life. It is not because of "love" or "dislike" of the countryside. The peasants left the clean, honest, and free (?) land, not because they "cannot resolutely endure hardship in the countryside to seek a living." On the contrary, even if they resolutely endure hardship in the countryside to seek a living, they still cannot find a place to live. From the increasing overpopulation in the city, we can see the gradual increase in the rate of peasants leaving the village. The continuous increase in the import of major grains further shows the declining rural economy in China. The essence of the countryside has been exploited for thousands of years and flowed into the city (especially Shanghai) with the gentry, officials, and into the banks (especially foreign banks). In this way, the Chinese countryside has become an empty cellar, which has long been looted clean. We want the unemployed in the city to run to this cellar to find a way out. What can they find? Mr. Reporter is right: "Running to the countryside to solve life problems will only result in remaining hungry and becoming a rural unemployed person." In terms of making a living, returning to the countryside is just a dead end. Mr. Xiongsheng will undoubtedly only be disappointed. Speaking of Mr. You Huai’gao's theory of saving the country through rural education, this is another topic. Although he wants to solve Mr. Xiongsheng's problem through this, he has not hit the point. Because the first step of his plan is for Mr. Xiongsheng to borrow at least 100 yuan from a friend at the tax office as capital. However, Mr. Xiongsheng clearly stated that he is a "complete proletarian." I think if he could "borrow at least 100 yuan" at once, he could at least rely on these relatives and friends to think of a way to stay in the city, instead of "sighing at the ocean and having no way" and thinking of returning to the countryside. Seeing the beggars on the roadside, he scolded them for being too lazy and unmotivated, and why they didn't find some money to do small business and earn a living by their own efforts. This is such a straightforward statement. Let's take a step back. Mr. You can "design" to borrow this batch of capital for Mr. Xiongsheng. Can this batch of capital make a huge profit and maintain one person's life for three or four years? Can it support "the old mother above and the wife and children below?" That's right, Mr. You has a lot of designs. He wants to charge a tuition fee of one yuan per section. He wants each child to pay one chicken, one duck, or thirty eggs to the school every year. Can every peasant family in the impoverished countryside afford this? Has Mr. You ever known how many peasants in each village do not have "one yuan" hidden on them all year round? How many peasant families don't even have food to feed chickens or ducks, and are forced to sell chickens, ducks, and their eggs at low prices in exchange for a temporary full meal? How many families can take the surplus wealth to let you city unemployed "wear Zhongshan suits" and "wear cloth robes," and support you, "a leader standing out from the crowd," to "save the country through rural education?" The illusion is finally shattered by reality. As for Mr. You wanting to use bank loans as a "very solid" foundation, this is even more of an illusion. The bank's capital flows for profit. If it can be the foundation of your career, why doesn't he, the banker, go to "absolutely advocate and implement efforts to save the country through rural education?" According to our recent experience, we only know that bank loans require a large number of agricultural products as collateral, village gentry and wealthy people as guarantees, and more than one percent interest per year. And if it is not repaid on time, the collateral will be sold, and the surplus will be confiscated. Not enough to compensate. Moreover, what guarantee does a city unemployed youth have to borrow money from the bank? Even if you borrow money by various means, you are only helping the bank to do the work of re-exploiting the peasants, and doing the work of accelerating the collapse of the rural economy. You will not wait until "students grow up in three or four years," but see your employer and your students, "future believers," displaced and wandering in the ravines, away from your "illusion" by 18,000 feet. Mr. You is not only very knowledgeable about rural education, but also a master of utopianism who uses "imagination" to avoid reality. Mr. Xiongsheng, Mr. Reporter, and dear readers, please give a fair criticism. In short, based on Mr. Xiongsheng's motivation, one cannot return to the countryside. According to Mr. You's "imagination," returning to the countryside is also a dead end. Of course, the countryside has its own historical destiny, and it will not leave the various stages that it must go through in its evolution because someone comes to prosper it or not. At the same time, Mr. Xiongsheng's suffering is the common suffering of his contemporaries. If he does not have a bit of courage to survive and is always so cowardly as to "have no courage to commit crimes and no courage to commit suicide," the only way out may be to starve to death. We are very surprised. Why can't a youth in this era face the common enemy of society and fight, but instead succumb to a corner, fantasizing about the arrival of a savior, or waiting for death?</p>

<p>Carrying a Large Number of Comfort Items and a Thousand Broadswords</p>
<p>The Shandong education circle, because the soldiers at the front line are fighting against Japan and shedding blood on the battlefield, specially initiated a fundraising campaign to comfort the troops to fulfill the national duty. All educational personnel in the province, hearing the news, enthusiastically contributed. In the shortest period of time, 14,500 yuan has been raised. It was decided to use 5,000 yuan in cash to comfort the wounded soldiers, use 5,000 yuan to purchase items to donate to the soldiers at the front line, and make another 1,000 broadswords to send to the front for killing the enemy. At 3 pm on the 12th, the three representatives of the education circle, Sun Dongsheng, Xu Bopu, and Wang Lifu, had already carried the cash and 1,000 sets of trousers and jackets, 2,000 straw sandals, 10,000 towels, 2,400 pairs of socks, 5,000 burlap bags, and more than 2,000 catties of pickles, and took the 10th train on the Jinpu Railway north. At that time, because the prepared small car was not enough, the stationmaster helped to replace it with a larger car. Students from the Second Provincial Experimental Primary School donated a pair of socks and a towel, specifically to be given to Song Zheyuan, the commander of the 29th Army. Next, the Kuangshi Sanyi Yong Burlap Bag Company donated 1,000 burlap bags, which were also handed over to the representatives to take with them. He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, and Wang Jinxin, Secretary-General, and others went to the station to see them off when the representatives went north and took care of everything. Mr. He also sent a telegram to He Yingqin and Chiang Kai-shek of the Beiping Military Affairs Committee, asking them to take care of them.</p>

<p>Tianjin Wins Due to Home Advantage, Talent, and Teamwork</p>
<p>Jie Hansheng, Defei, and Zhou Xianyan Were the Most Outstanding</p>
<p>Shanghai Will Play the Tianjin Chinese Combined Team Today</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 15th) The Tianjin-Shanghai inter-port football match was held at 3 PM today at the British football field. As a result, Tianjin won by a large margin of 7-1. The spirit of both sides was very good, and the audience was very interested.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Shanghai Lost Two Goals in Ten Minutes <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In the first five minutes, the Tianjin team launched an offensive, with the left wing being particularly active. With excellent coordination, the Shanghai goal was first breached. In a few minutes, the Tianjin team attacked from the middle again and scored again. Within ten minutes, Shanghai lost two goals in a row.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Twelve-Yard Gate Falls Again: Shanghai Continues to Lose Ground <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>So they played cautiously, and the situation eased slightly. However, Shanghai was soon penalized with a twelve-yard penalty, resulting in a score of 3-0. Tianjin's left inside forward, Jie Hansheng, who was famous at sea a few years ago, scored a goal alone, charging in and scoring with a long shot. It was exceptionally wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Shanghai Team Finally Scores: Up to this point, Shanghai was heavily defeated 4-0. <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>A few minutes before the end of the first half, Shanghai worked hard to counterattack and got a corner kick, finally scoring and opening Shanghai's account. The score at halftime was Tianjin 4, Shanghai 1.</p>
<h3 id="e192">3-0 in the Second Half <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Counterattack Fails Again and Loses: After the break, the battle continued. Shanghai was greatly invigorated and counterattacked repeatedly, but to no avail. Tianjin, on the other hand, seized an opportunity and approached the city again. In the melee in front of the goal, Tianjin scored the fifth goal.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Wonderful Pass for Sixth Goal: <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The outcome of the game seemed to be determined. The battle situation formed a trend of individual actions. Tianjin's offense also slowed down. Just before the end of the game, Tianjin inadvertently passed the ball beautifully several times and scored the sixth goal.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Jie Hansheng's Final Masterpiece: <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>At this point, although Shanghai tried to get excited, it was impossible to turn the tide. Several attacks failed to break through the solid wall of Tianjin's defense. In the last two minutes, Tianjin's main player, Jie Hansheng, fired a long shot that was unstoppable, entering the net just a few inches below the goalpost, resulting in a final score of 7-1.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Overview of Tianjin and Shanghai's Gains and Losses <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Although the results were very different, Shanghai's performance was remarkable. Among the forwards, Defei was the most brilliant. Zhou Xianyan's goalkeeping was also highly praised, having saved countless unavoidable dangers. Otherwise, the score would have been even worse. The reason for the defeat was that the strength of the center back and full back lines was insufficient. Tianjin's victory was due to home advantage, familiarity, and even talent. Their excellent teamwork was something that Shanghai could not match. Today, Shanghai will play against the Tianjin Chinese Combined Team.</p>
<p>Jiangda Basketball</p>
<h3 id="e196">Daxia Wins the First Final in the Men's Division Against Jinan <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Four to Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>A Second Final Is Still Needed</p>
<p>The men's basketball championship of Jiangda, Daxia and Jinan, had equal scores, so a final of three games with one win was made. The first final yesterday was held at the China Basketball Stadium, Daxia won Jinan with thirty-four to twenty-five, taking the first step. Due to the panic and tension on both sides, the performance was diminished. The cheering students from both schools in the stadium were very loud. The referees were Li Zuqi and Wu Jiatang.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Both Sides Show Panic <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Because it was about the championship, both sides showed panic and could not calm down. After the start of the jump ball, people were flustered and confused, unable to grasp or be sure of anything. Even until the end, they could not fully recover their normal state due to the tension of the situation. Jinan's Han Zhenyuan, amidst the chaos, broke through and made a steady throw under the basket, but failed. Three or four minutes later, Daxia's Chen Baoqiu scored two consecutive times, and the record of 4-0 was opened.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Daxia Wavered <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Jinan found a loophole, retreated to attack, and scored three points. Daxia scored again, Jinan recovered again, making it a 6-6 tie, and then surpassed it with 8-6. At this time, Daxia suddenly showed a wavering state. The full-back general, Guan Dang'an, was penalized out for four fouls. Jinan took this opportunity to jump up, 9-7, 11-8, leading by three or four points for a moment. Fortunately, Daxia fought hard, and the first half ended with an equal score of 19-19.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Jinan Could Not Hold On <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Daxia's momentum improved slightly, but they lost countless certain opportunities. Each scored one goal, making it 21 equal. At this time, Daxia's Ren Jiexing lost a great opportunity for a sneak attack under the basket, and Chen Maiqiu missed consecutive free throws, feeling very frustrated. Jinan, with a throw from Xu Rongshui, turned it into an equal score. Daxia then fully mobilized, their skills gradually became familiar, and Ren Jiexing scored three consecutive goals. Jinan's Wang Nanzhen and Xu Rongshui were successively penalized out, a fatal blow, and they could not hold on. Daxia finally won with thirty-four to twenty-nine, which can be called a hard-fought battle.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Three elementary school students, only fourteen or fifteen years old, from the Guangzhou Municipal Fifty-Fourth Elementary School, determined to join the army and kill the enemy because the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol had fallen one after another. Beforehand, they only told their parents that the school's scout camp required three days of overnight stay. After several days, the school and the parents of each student received letters from the children, stating that they had joined the Nineteenth Route Army to prepare to go north and kill the enemy! Who are the children? Luo Weiquan, Huang Yanxing, and Dong Yuekang, all sons of wealthy merchants from Guangdong and Hong Kong. The letters received by the school have been disclosed in various newspapers in Guangdong and Hong Kong:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, the three provinces have fallen, and Jehol has been lost. All enthusiastic men should save the nation. But, Xue Liang and others abandoned the land and fled. We, students, seeing this, should do our part. So, we joined the army to kill the enemy. We separate from now on, and we will meet again in the next life. With grief and indignation, we cannot say everything! Students Luo Weiquan, Huang Yanxing, and Dong Yuekang together.</p>
<p>Some people, after seeing this letter, appreciated their clear and smooth writing, indeed promising talents. Since they are sons of wealthy merchants, they could work hard in science, study aviation, and when there is a chance in the future, engage in saving the country and killing the enemy, which would certainly be a considerable achievement. Wouldn't that be much better than being underage soldiers now? I say: This is true, but the high-spirited children, when they say save the country, they save the country, with a feeling of "If this is the case, why wait for next year?" One must not use the cautious thinking of adults to criticize the average national salvation children. I am sorry that they are too young for their national salvation determination, but they do what they say, and they do it before they say it, not saying it without doing it. This is the prototype of Wang Yangming's unity of knowledge and action. Compared to the recent speculative soldiers' telegrams of killing the enemy, flying like snowflakes, but in the end, they just run away, alas! Reading the children's letters, how can one not be ashamed to die?</p>
<p>After Children's Day, with these three children who abandoned their pens and joined the army, the value of Children's Day has been greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>— Held by Buddha</p>
<p>Whenever we pass the entrance of a venereal disease doctor, we often see a shocking advertisement: a beautiful woman's head, whose lower body suddenly transforms into a terrifying poisonous snake, entwined around a young man's body, clinging to him like glue, refusing to let go. If we were to cover the lower half of that beauty's snake body, we would surely say she is an angel from heaven, a rare beauty in the world; if we didn't uncover it and take a look, and saw it was the snake-bodied, human-faced monster mentioned in the Classic of Mountains and Seas, then such an intimate, lingering scene would probably make even Liu Xiahui's heart waver, and cause Lu the Manly Man to experience a "sexual impulse."</p>
<p>On the streets, we often see this phenomenon: when friends are fighting on the road, they are sure to have their factions; during the fight, they might pretend to be "peacemakers," acting with zealous enthusiasm and high righteousness, appointing themselves as Lu Zhonglian. However, when the opportunity arises, they learn the methods of boxing instructors, only saying in their mouths, "We are all family, let's talk it over, why resort to violence?" Little do you know, they'll be impolite and deliver a few cold punches, only they secretly understand which side they are biased towards. Most hilariously, after punching someone a few times, they press their own arm, groaning in pain, claiming to have been injured by the other person. This is a common occurrence in society, nothing too comical.</p>
<p>Aren't the Japanese's specialties and ghostly tricks very similar to the above two scenarios? They clearly understand the weaknesses of us Chinese people, | which are also our bad habits | After plundering the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, they released a lot of hot air to confuse people's minds: what direct negotiations, what military agreements. They even advocated Sino-Japanese cooperation, maintaining peace in East Asia; Sino-Japanese relations returning to their old friendship, avoiding a second world war; isn't this like punching someone a few times and saying, "No fight, no acquaintance?" Isn't this like a female con artist using seductive means to carry out her extortionist tricks? We must not listen to the Japanese's sweet talk, and beware that although they have human faces, they have snake bodies underneath!</p>
<p>The Japanese government's diplomacy completely adopts the "seduction policy" of prostitutes, just like the "smokescreen" used in wartime. This "seduction policy" has anesthetized us forgetful Chinese people, and it is indeed even more dangerous and frightening than a smokescreen! I advise my compatriots who are content with temporary peace, and who are lazy and forgetful, never to fall for the Japanese! I say this because we Chinese people are unusually enthusiastic and energetic about the occurrence of a certain event. For example, newspapers that bear the responsibility of guiding the people, are initially very energetic, using special headline fonts; later, they gradually fade away, using first-class fonts; after a long time, they fade away as if forgotten, and you can't find a single word about it in the entire newspaper! Alas! Is this the phenomenon we are seeing now? I dare not say!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Antiques and Secondhand Goods <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Old copper and rotten iron, moth-eaten books and worm-eaten paintings. Once they enter an antique shop, their value increases tenfold; once they arrive at a secondhand stall, they are worthless. In reality, to speak plainly, they are all old things; they are all shelved goods. Called an antique, it's worth a fortune; changed into secondhand goods, it's not worth a cent. What is the difference there? It's really inexplicable!</p>
<p>The patrons of antique shops are: blue-eyed, blonde foreigners; pot-bellied, wealthy merchants; politicians and military men who have retired from office; hermits who consider themselves loyal. They take a fancy to an item, pay thousands or tens of thousands for it, take it back to appreciate and cherish it, and this old thing is in luck.</p>
<p>The old customers of secondhand stalls are: disheveled and dirty coolies; old soldiers with hunched shoulders; peddlers and laborers in tattered clothes: the deals they make are mostly a few copper coins, and if they spend a few dimes, it's a really big deal. If he has money, he will throw it in the trash can; he won't cherish it or collect it!</p>
<p>Alas! Outdated goods, in luck, become antiques, out of luck, become secondhand goods. Things are like this, let alone people. Look at those with brilliant achievements, leaving their names in history, these are the antiques among people; those who are unappreciated and die old under the window, they are the secondhand goods among people. Success makes a king, failure makes a bandit. The difference between antiques and secondhand goods must be in this.</p>
<p>Even we writers can't escape this example. Some publications become popular as soon as they are published, and the paper is expensive in Luoyang; some are scribbled and smeared, and ultimately belong to the word box. What about racking your brains, what about deliberation, as long as you ask yourself whether you are an antique or secondhand goods? If you are an antique, someone will beg you. If it's secondhand goods, then crying in front of the Emperor Wenchang and the Most Holy Teacher and the old man Cangjie will have no effect.</p>
<p>Alas! Antiques and secondhand goods really cause all kinds of doubts; and add a lot of misery!</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Mystery of the Leather Bag <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xichang</p>
<p>The leather bag is not the large suitcase you take when traveling to Europe and America, nor is it the wooden box at home for storing clothes, it is a fourteen-inch-long leather satchel used by students as a book bag. When you walk through Ximen, the center where students gather and disperse, you can see many people carrying leather bags, especially in the morning when going to school, or on Zhonghua Road after 4 PM when school is dismissed, in groups of three or five, men in gowns and Western trousers, women in shorts and long cheongsams, except for a triangular or rectangular colored school badge pinned on the front placket, the one they hold in their hands is the leather bag I am talking about.</p>
<p>Some villagers who have just arrived in Shanghai, when they saw it, they said to their companions: "How come there are so many young foreign doctors?"</p>
<p>On the cover of the leather bag, a few fancy English letters are written in lacquer, which turns out to be the full name of the owner of the leather bag, so this can save the trouble of male and female students communicating their names in social interactions, and the busy work of several young masters and young ladies seeking love and secretly checking their names.</p>
<p>Even more so, a group of female students who are slightly lower in grade, the books they read are all thin paper books in Chinese, Party Principles, history, geography, etc., without the embellishment of gold-lettered leather-covered foreign-bound thick books, for the sake of being fashionable, they have to patronize the leather bag that costs three silver dollars a piece.</p>
<p>Therefore, before and after the start of each semester, the bosses of those leather suitcase stores rush to produce them day and night, and it is not enough to meet the market demand.</p>
<p>As for the other mysteries of the leather bag, I will have to ask those who have leather bags to tell you themselves.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Love Resumes in the Teahouse, Difficult New Year at the Pawnshop</p>
<p>Gui Zhi said: But we still owe him money from last year, maybe he deducted it. We don't have any children at home, do we need this honey offering? It's not a big deal. Jiang Shi said: Even though you say that, offering to Heaven and Earth and our ancestors is a once-a-year thing, and if we can't even do it, people will laugh at us, saying we're really not like a proper family. Gui Zhi said: Let's calculate how much money people outside owe us, we should go collect it. Today is the twenty-sixth, and this month is a short one, meaning it's almost New Year's Eve. Gui Zhi said: I calculated it a long time ago, it's only two or three dollars. It's useless to ask for it. We should wait for old Li from the village to send money. Jiang Shi said: This old Li is also taking advantage of us orphans and widows. The money that should have been given in the ninth and tenth months isn't even enough now. If he doesn't send it today, I'll have to get up early tomorrow and go find him. Gui Zhi said: You should have gone a long time ago. The New Year is coming soon, and there's no money for anything, what are you going to do on New Year's Eve? Jiang Shi was already full of worries. After her daughter said this, she became even more anxious. She waited until late that day, but didn't see old Li send any money. Jiang Shi didn't sleep well all night. The next day, she got up early and hired a donkey to go to the village. At three or four o'clock in the afternoon, Jiang Shi returned home with a dusty face, clear snot frozen and streaming down her face, looking dejected. Gui Zhi rushed to ask: How's the money? Jiang Shi sat on the bed, and after a long while, she said: Let me catch my breath before I tell you. Seeing this, Gui Zhi guessed that she probably didn't get the money, and didn't dare to say much, fearing it would make her mother even angrier. After a while, Jiang Shi poured a cup of hot water from the stove and drank it, then wiped her face, and then went outside to brush off the dirt from her body before walking back into the inner room and saying: Look, isn't this killing us? Old Li went to Baoding a month ago and hasn't returned to this day. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I said, in that case, don't even think about celebrating the New Year, I'm going to take my child and stay at his house for a few days. His daughter-in-law got anxious, and only then did she take out five dollars to teach me to take back and use first. She also asked many people to come out and speak for me. (43)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3 id="e215">Several Toys <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>Prelude</p>
<p>I dare not say that our country's family education is so bad; but because the family pays too little attention to the children's toys, the children's knowledge, such as the skills of playing mahjong, which is all about winning, are more sophisticated and popular than any other knowledge! Mahjong can practice mental arithmetic, which is not a bad toy, but the people who play mahjong use it as a tool for gambling money, and some people stay up all night, indulging in it. This bad influence, instilled into the pure minds of children, is more harmful than beneficial. Therefore, children's toys must be found outside of mahjong. The following types, although common toys, can exercise the body, increase intelligence, and are cheap and easy to make. Children in any family can enjoy them. Now I specially write them out to offer to my dear children.</p>
<p>Jianzi and Diabolo</p>
<p>In these years, we must prepare for how to deal with the "arrival of the worst environment" and exercise our physique, which is the most needed course. Therefore, the kind of "ping pong" and "tennis" that can exercise the physique are all beneficial games for children. But the simplest toy in the family that is good for the body is the jianzi and the diabolo. The method of making jianzi is very simple: use a large steel coin, sew it with cloth, and sew a chicken feather tube on it; after sewing, insert three or four rooster tail feathers into the tube, and the jianzi is made. (Some use paper to make it, the method is also very simple). The way to play jianzi is mostly by kicking it with the foot. In addition to the most common right foot kick, there are also various styles such as combined plate (kicking with both feet), turning, leaping, and jumping. The lively jumping can not only practice leg strength, but also activate all parts of the body. There are single-headed and double-headed diabolos, which are sold in the market and are very cheap. Playing the diabolo can not only exercise the muscles and bones of the whole body, but also emit a pleasant ringing sound; after playing it skillfully, you can also throw it up and down to create new tricks.</p>
<p>Tangram and Puzzle</p>
<p>In addition to building blocks and chess pieces, the tangram and puzzle are indeed also gifts from children that can increase intelligence. The structure of the tangram: there are two large triangles, two small triangles, one medium triangle, and two oblique acute angles and squares; large and small, a total of seven pieces, so it is called "tangram" (Tangram and books about it are sold in the Commercial Press. The tangram is also easy to make by yourself, take a square mahogany, or glass, hard cardboard is also acceptable, a flat hard object, draw diagonally, add a little procedure, 丨 see the picture 丨 is complete.) can be assembled into various utensils and figure forms. The structure of the puzzle is more complicated, with a total of fifteen pieces (see Figure 2) of different sizes of sharp oblique squares and circles, so it feels exquisite and lifelike to assemble it into utensils and figures. Now I have drawn some things about the puzzle on the top. Children, you may also imitate to create a few styles, and you will definitely feel endless interest!</p>

<h3 id="e216">Thoughts on the "Sexual Desire Problem of Prisoners" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiuxia</p>
<p>Ever since Dr. Zhang advocated sexology, the world has been in turmoil. Now this old man has returned from "sex" to "farming," as if the sex craze has subsided, and not many people are advocating the "sex" problem anymore. But in the past few days, a certain legislative member has brought up the issue of prisoners' sex on the news. After all, elegant music has a lingering quality, which makes me solemnly admire him!</p>
<p>The member doesn't think much about the group in hell, but focuses on sexual desire, which is called seeing the hidden and benefiting the subordinates. As usual, it also belongs to the emperor's vast grace.</p>
<p>However, I don't understand other things very well, but I have had a glimpse into prisons. As far as I know: the criminals in prison do not feel any sexual distress. On the contrary, the oppression of hunger and cold, and the suffocation of death, are what they endure. Because all prisons, even those that claim to be "model" prisons, the prisoners only eat twenty-four ounces of grains, mixed with chaff, sand, and stone, and two chopsticks of smelly root vegetables every day. They live in a damp small room (a "cell" of less than seven feet square, where two or three people live). In winter, the bedding that can be issued by chance is an old and broken blanket like a spider web. In summer, in a cell full of sweat and stench, they are like steamed buns in a steamer. People living in this living hell become half-dead in less than a year or two. Because they don't have enough nutrition and lack air and exercise, the sexual desire problem that the adults are concerned about can be said to be simply irrelevant.</p>
<p>However, this is not surprising. The adults go out in cars, eat big meals, and live in Western-style houses. In such a well-fed life, women are naturally considered the only important thing. There was an emperor who asked starving people why they didn't eat meat porridge? It's not unreasonable for the adults to pay attention to the sexual desires of prisoners. Moreover, "according to the law," "imitating the West," speaking with logic, and discussing with evidence, it is indeed feasible. Unfortunately, I don't know if it is because the bodies of Chinese people are worse, or if there are other reasons, but I always feel that this opinion is a bit like joking.</p>
<p>Although it is, "food and sex are human nature," as the sages said, but for those who are not as well-fed as the adults, the problem of sexual desire does not seem necessary. If prisoners were given a chance for temporary freedom, then the "freedom" that criminals and non-criminals would demand is more than just indulging the emperor's grace on women. As for saying "no descendants is the greatest unfilial act," this is not true. China's population is already too large, and the traitors that these traitors raise are probably small traitors. In the future, if the "internal" is not stable, there is no way to resist the "external," and at least they will have to be "suppressed" a few times, which is just asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better for that member to cancel this opinion. I think the prisoners don't care about such grace at all.</p>
<h3 id="e217">"Bachelor Crying for His Wife" and "Tears on the Barren Mountain" <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Dezhong</p>
<p>I remember a small thing, which I heard from other people's mouths, but until yesterday, I couldn't find any proof, so I never told anyone else about it.</p>
<p>That was when the ministers of the Manchu Qing Dynasty met with foreign representatives for the first time. The foreigners all sang their own national anthems with "yi yi wu wu." What did our Manchu Qing ministers sing? Everyone stood up and discussed for a long time, and then sang a short tune, probably called "Bachelor Crying for His Wife"! It was so sad and mournful that the yellow-haired devils were confused!</p>
<p>When I heard this, I thought it was impossible. Even if the Manchu Qing government was corrupt and the officials were confused, it would not be so bad.</p>
<p>Now, our artistic star Cheng Yanqiu, who "self-funded" a trip to France to study art, has returned to China. In his conversation with reporters, he said:</p>
<p>I did not perform dramas in Germany and France. ... Only at the opening of the International New Education Conference in July last year, as usual, each country's national anthem had to be played before the representative's speech. Before the speech of our country's representative, I sang a section of "Tears on the Barren Mountain." There was no erhu, no drum, just a dry song, which was something I had never done in my life.</p>
<p>So I can't help but believe that "Tears on the Barren Mountain" can represent "national anthem," and "Bachelor Crying for His Wife" can certainly represent "national anthem."</p>
<p>But the point to note here is, what is "Tears on the Barren Mountain"? It is an opera based on the "tyrannical government is fiercer than a tiger" in the Tan Gong chapter of the Book of Rites. The father-in-law and husband are all dead, leaving only a small widow, sadly and mournfully "crying." This little widow is Cheng's signature role. Of course, singing such a "signature role" with "no erhu, no drum, just a dry song," how much of a condescension for Cheng's great talent!</p>
<p>Before it was crying for a wife, now it is crying for a husband, which is comparable before and after, but unfortunately the yellow-haired foreign devils are just as confused!</p>
<h3 id="e218">The Death of Bai Yutang <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>Recently, I read "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" and its sequel, and saw that many Chinese moral values and traditional thoughts are clearly expressed in these books, and undoubtedly these stale moral thoughts have dominated the Chinese readers for hundreds of years. The most obvious example is the death of Bai Yutang.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the authors who wrote books like "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" can be simply explained in a few words. What they unanimously praised was "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness," what they hated to the bone was "adultery, theft, and evil," and at the same time what they wanted to express in their stories was "retribution is a cycle, heaven's principles are infallible." And for them, the ultimate retribution for mankind is death, especially "violent death."</p>
<p>Therefore, all chivalrous people ended up being granted official positions, glorifying their families, and they must have very kind descendants. Those evildoers were either arrested and executed, or they must die under random knives. But in the case of Bai Yutang, it is a unique example.</p>
<p>Bai Yutang, nicknamed the Brocade-Coated Rat, is one of the most important characters, one of the five rats, and because of his prominent personality (most of the characters in this type of book have no personality), he is a very lively and lovely character. What is his personality like? According to the author, he is "arrogant and self-willed." This kind of temper is nothing now, but for an author with such traditional thoughts, a person who is not smooth in dealing with the world, who does not give in to others in everything, who does not obey others in everything, this is terrible, he should be given retribution, so Bai Yutang, although he is a righteous man, had to die.</p>
<p>Bai Yutang explored the Chongxiao Tower three times and died under random arrows. His body was "like a hedgehog," which was really unbearable to witness. If this death is explained based on Bai Yutang's character, it may be touching and make readers feel more in line, but the author did not do so. He ultimately had to bring out the great truth of the cycle of retribution, and through the mouth of the deceased's sworn brother Jiang Ping, he said these words:</p>
<p>"Speaking of our fifth brother, he is really pitiful: this is also because of his usual sinister and harsh behavior, so he suffered this tragic death."</p>
<p>In addition to the death of Bai Yutang, there are two or three other deaths of chivalrous heroes, which also convey the same thoughts of these authors. In the seventy-ninth chapter of the fourth volume of "Sequel to Little Five Gallants," two righteous men who had just been granted official positions also suffered violent deaths, one was Han Liang, nicknamed Overcloud Eagle; the other was Xiong Wei, nicknamed Jade-Faced Cat; they were killed for stealing back the lost clothes and crowns for the emperor in the Cangzhen Tower. The reason for their death was also said through the mouths of the characters in the book.</p>
<p>"Grandpa Zhi (that is, the Black-Eared Fox Zhihua) said: "You don't know about that. These two people are being punished."</p>
<p>"Xu Liang asked: "What is being punished?"</p>
<p>"Grandpa Zhi said: "You don't know about that. When the three of them were the village masters on the Jiafeng Mountain, Xiong Wei brought his family to the mountain, and Han Liang thought it was inconvenient for women to go out, so he forcibly had the minions move out the statue of the Jade Emperor in the Jade Emperor Pavilion and throw it into the mountain stream. This Jade Emperor Pavilion was counted as the back stronghold, and the women lived there. Later, when Xiong Wei came back, he should not have followed them; but he didn't want to hurt the feelings of his brothers. Among them, Peng Yu repeatedly told them not to use the Jade Emperor Pavilion as the back stronghold, but these two people would not listen. When the priest Wei Dao came the next day, the Jade Emperor Pavilion had already been changed to the back stronghold; the priest had no choice but to chant Amitabha three times facing the back. Do you think this retribution is real or not? Xiong Wei, Han Liang, and Peng Yu are life-and-death friends, why is it just Xiong Wei and Han Liang, where did Peng Yu go? If he came, he would have died here too. It shows that people must have good hearts, and the gods and Buddhas must be respected."</p>
<p>Bai Yutang's death still has an internal relationship with his character that can be explained, but the deaths of these two people have nothing to do with themselves. In order to convey the idea of respecting gods, the author had to make them suffer tragic deaths. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(19) Dai Dongyuan's Philosophy</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi alone respected Dai Zhen among the thinkers of China in the last three hundred years. He wrote a book called "Dai Dongyuan's Philosophy," which was published by the Commercial Press, and also wrote an article called "Several Anti-Neo-Confucian Thinkers," which was included in the third collection of Hu Shi's essays. The article states that Dai was a scientist, good at mathematics, and proficient in textual research, so his research methods were the most precise, and his philosophy was a philosophy with a scientific spirit. As for why Dai had this thought? Why did he have this philosophy? Dr. Hu has yet to explain. Dr. Hu wrote an article on the New Life, teaching people to always ask "why" in everything, and said that "the difference between humans and animals lies in this 'why'." I wonder why Dr. Hu forgot his "why" teachings when talking about Dai Dongyuan's philosophy. "Taiyan's Speech Records" has a lot of explanations as to why Dai Dongyuan opposed Neo-Confucianism, and it is a pleasure to read. It is recorded here:</p>
<p>Although Mr. Dongyuan specialized in Confucianism, he did not agree with the Song Confucians, and often said, "The law kills people, but it can still be saved; Neo-Confucianism kills people, and there is no way to save it." Because at the end of the Manchu Yongzheng period, the Manchu Yongzheng's red-approved edicts, when blaming his subordinates, did not use the words of the law, but always said, "Where is your conscience? Can you ask yourself without shame?" With just these few words of Song Confucian Neo-Confucianism, he could kill people arbitrarily. People always say that Yongzheng treated people the most cruelly, but they don't know that it was Neo-Confucianism that helped him. Therefore, Mr. Dongyuan cried bitterly and made a small booklet (referring to the book "Mencius's Meaning of Words Explained"). His book did not explicitly scold the Manchus, but seeing his book, no one did not deeply hate the Manchus.</p>
<p>I will send this remotely to Dr. Hu, who likes to ask "why," and ask why Mr. Dai Dongyuan wanted to oppose Neo-Confucianism. As for whether Mr. Taiyan's words have any basis, I also hope that someone who has a textual research addiction and a historical addiction like Dr. Hu Shi can tell me.</p>

<p>"Then shall I go call someone to repair it?"</p>
<p>Haiquan eagerly stood up, volunteering.</p>
<p>"Don't go. Someone has been called."</p>
<p>She smiled and reached out to stop him.</p>
<p>"Who called them?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu. He came to see Ah Cao just now. I troubled him to call them."</p>
<p>Haiquan often heard Qiuying mention someone named Zhu, which inevitably aroused his suspicion of them. Therefore, he was silent for a while, just sitting and daydreaming.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, what are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>He immediately felt that she had already guessed his thoughts.</p>
<p>The sky grew darker. He could no longer clearly see the contours of her face. Because of his experience from earlier in the day, he moved closer to her face again, but at the same time, he cursed his own baseness. Qiuying just smiled and gave him a kiss without any resistance. He felt that her movements were not as passionate as they had been earlier, and her spirit seemed very tired. As soon as he left her, he heard footsteps on the stairs outside.</p>
<p>"Is that Uncle Zhu?"</p>
<p>Her clear voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is."</p>
<p>A dull voice from outside.</p>
<p>Haiquan saw a young man leading an electrician into the room. But he could not clearly see their faces.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, hold this for me..."</p>
<p>Haiquan had just taken the child when he smelled a stench of urine. He saw Qiuying walk up to the man named Zhu, pull his hand, and they went out together. Their attitude further aroused Haiquan's suspicion.</p>
<p>Before long, the electric light was on, and the child in Haiquan's arms began to cry. Qiuying and the young man named Zhu returned to the room together. Haiquan carefully looked at him. He was a little shorter and fatter than Haiquan, and his body seemed sturdier. He had a pale, white face, and at first glance, he did indeed look like a handsome man. But his eyes were small, and on closer inspection, his figure seemed a little bloated, completely like a little white elephant.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the customs closure. The banks had no transactions of note. The interbank foreign exchange rate in the market remained at two cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions. There were also not many interbank bill transactions, with over 4.5 million in the morning session and over 700,000 in the afternoon session. Transactions in the small general association amounted to over 400,000. The money shops mainly settled public foreign exchange bills, as it was the first day of the fifteenth period, so settlements were slightly more numerous, totaling over 39 million. Remittances from all routes amounted to over 400,000. The market situation for subsidiary coins saw a sharp rise in Jiangnan, with both morning and afternoon sessions at 869 yuan, a sharp increase of three yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were 14,000 jiao in the morning session and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small foreign coins were 798 yuan in the morning session and 796.5 jiao in the afternoon session, resulting in a slight decrease of three to four yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were 90,000 jiao in the morning session and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins decreased by 1,500 wen, to 304,500 wen. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Clearing House on the 15th was 3,469,747.71 silver yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Securities and Government Bonds Slightly Rebound <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a slight rebound. Number 54 had stopped selling, and there was a surge of buyers in the market. The overall situation remained unchanged. Finance Minister Song's trip to Washington for a meeting regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute may lead to a resolution, and the timeframe is only two months, which dispelled doubts in the market. Short covering and hedging advanced simultaneously, allowing prices to turn around. The opening was still uncertain in the morning, initially falling by one or two jiao. Later, when trading in the 20-term forward market, major players showed some interest, and the market gradually rose, boosting market sentiment. Consolidated salt tax was particularly strong. Salt tax futures jumped six jiao, causing a shortage of chips in the market. In the secondary market, scattered retail demand was also strong. The aforementioned varieties all rebounded by three or four jiao. The 20-year varieties also showed strength. Only salt tax appeared flat. The afternoon market remained firm. Sellers were scarce, so trading decreased. However, the imbalance between supply and demand meant that the bulls still dominated both sessions. Each session continued to rise by two or three jiao to four jiao. At the close, the salt tax continued to rise strongly. As a result, prices rebounded across the board by two or three jiao to seven or eight jiao. Only this month's salt tax rose by one yuan, making it the largest increase. The total turnover was 7,100,600 yuan, of which only 1,000 yuan was in cash, and 7,100,500 yuan was in futures. Among them, consolidated salt tax accounted for over 2.7 million, troop reduction accounted for 1.08 million, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to six or seven thousand. Most transactions were in the forward market.</p>

<p>The yarn market remained weak, and the downward trend stabilized slightly, but the situation remained weak. Market sentiment was quite weak, as current yarn consumption was sluggish and all sectors lacked vitality. However, some buying occurred because the factory was holding a meeting today in Wuxi to discuss everything, so the market situation was slightly calmer in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Cotton Labels Fall Another Six or Seven Qian <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The cotton label market opened with a halt in foreign cotton trading. Near-month prices rose by one jiao, while far-month prices fell by two jiao. After large falls of one yuan in the second and third sessions, prices rose slightly by one or two jiao at the close. As a result, prices fell by seven or eight jiao across all months. In the afternoon, profit-takers covered their positions, and market sentiment was still strong. The market weakened again in the second and third sessions, with prices rising slightly by one or two jiao across all months. The total turnover for the day was 57,000 bales. Da Feng sold 1,350 bales, Heng Yi 750 bales, Yuan Da 1,600 bales, Sen Kang 1,400 bales, Chang Feng 1,100 bales, Yi Yu 650 bales, Xin Cheng 1,000 bales, and Tong He 900 bales.

<p>The downward trend in the cotton market is intensifying, as the yarn market has been sluggish for a long time. The cotton market had the potential to fall early on, but it was held up by speculators. Recently, the yarn market has been falling daily, and factories are not buying raw materials and are preparing to reduce production. Moreover, the arrival of goods from producing areas such as Hankou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, and Shandong is increasing daily, while sales are not moving. Cotton prices are easing daily, and some are coming to Shanghai to hedge. The market is showing signs of shaking.</p>

<p>The Zheng labels market opened with a large weakening. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and selling pressure was strong. Prices fell in every session by four, five, or six jiao. However, large bulls held firm in the far months. In the afternoon, near-month prices fell by one jiao. The total turnover for the day was 103,200 dan.

<p>(Tianjin News, 14th) This year's cotton yarn transactions remain sparse, and the market atmosphere is flat. Botou bought 16 bundles of Changshou yarn at 170.5 yuan. This street sold 10 bundles of Songhe yarn at 150.5 yuan.</p>

<p>A New York dispatch of April 13th regarding the cotton market situation for the week states: The cotton market remained stable this week due to broad demand from brokers and peers. Prices rose at the beginning of the week, triggering a lot of liquidation, which was absorbed during slight reactions. Today's prices have reached the best levels in the inflation movement. There is little selling in the South. According to southwestern news, domestic sales are also very small, as it is expected that the rural relief plan will result in rising cotton prices. Cotton planting work is progressing well in some parts of the eastern and western cotton belts, but it is delayed in the central region due to moist soil. New York peers expect cotton acreage to increase, but some believe that the rural relief bill, if passed early, could still influence new cotton planting, or the acreage planted. Cotton fabric trade is still limited due to uncertainty regarding the legislative bill.</p>

<p>As of April 10th, deliveries of White Bankxi cotton have reached 17,500 bales, but the transporter's records have not yet been released. White Roissy for July-August delivery has been firm due to hedging. Although export inquiries were slightly higher last week, the prospects are very disappointing due to the wide price difference between India and the United States. Local demand is slightly better, with White Roissy cotton about 3% better, and Sula and Navalit cotton about 7% better. As for domestic consumption, American cotton seems too expensive, so there is still hope for Indian cotton consumption in the future. The situation of local yarn mills is quite unsatisfactory, and Tai Du is inclined to a reduction policy.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Grains, River Down Rice Scarce, Lively <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals were on the 13th. Although the amount was small due to rain, the market situation was unavoidably lively due to the scarcity of arrivals. Prices for Su, Tong, and South Port rice rose by several fen to one jiao. Since only three boats of Shanghai rice arrived, 300-400 shi were handled, tightening the market. Green jiao rice prices were higher by one jiao, and Duyang and Jian rice were scarce, increasing prices by one jiao. The situation for Yinyuan rice remained popular, but as prices had reached their peak, they were settling. There was still no market for Bianyuan rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about twenty boats arrived from various river-down sectors. Bai Geng rice continued to be taken by merchants, and the market was expected to remain high. Medium-quality rice was also close to the foot. Early rice arrivals were sold twice, and prices remained stable. Yangjian and Dujian rice were stable, and Bujian rice was tight. Yinyuan rice was scarce, and Baiyuan rice showed little fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Guest Xian Rice Oversupplied, Price Falls Three Jiao <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Stockpilers Ship In 10,000 Bags of Xiang Xian Rice</p>
<p>Min Merchants Continue to Trade, Street Slightly Busy</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for Guest Xian rice was even worse, mainly because of sufficient inventory and full production areas, with limited sales. The market has shown a situation of oversupply. On top of small expectations, three boats suddenly arrived yesterday from Wuchang, Changxing, and Jiangxin, carrying 10,000 bags of Hunan-Jiangxi rice, mainly Hunan rice, which stockpilers had stored. Hunan rice had an excellent harvest, and traders from local and Shanghai-Hankou stockpiled large quantities, originally intending to sell when local prices were high. Recently, local market prices have been sluggish, and markets in Hankou and the upper reaches have been stagnant. Therefore, they had to try shipping to Shanghai to wait for a chance to sell. However, the Shanghai market has been stagnant for a long time, and there is a lot of inventory. The only outlet is the Min Merchants. After this batch arrived yesterday, the market was further affected, and prices suddenly fell by two or three jiao. After the price fell, Min Merchants and Yang merchants in this street started buying, but there were still more arrivals than sales, and the market could not turn around. The full day's openings included 1,000 bags of late Jiangxi milled rice, priced at 8.3 yuan to 8.75 yuan; 700 bags of Hunan milled red rice, priced at 7.97 yuan to 7.87 yuan; 700 bags of rough red rice, priced at 6.8 yuan; 500 bags of milled oil rice, priced at 7.95 yuan to 7.87 yuan; and 150 bags of rough oil rice, priced at 7.6 yuan. Among these, merchants in this street bought 400 bags of milled red rice and 60 bags of milled late rice, while the rest were bought by the Min Merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Quiet, Weak Labels for Noodles <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the noodle market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month presented a flat and weak trend. The halt in trading of foreign wheat and the lack of quotations caused the market situation to become cold again. In this month's transactions, customer merchants slightly sold out, while factory shorts did not cover. In the far months, only Datong slightly sold out, and the rest remained unchanged. In the current situation, the lack of funds and low consumption of merchants in the mainland, and the impact of the war on the northern ports, have prevented buyers from expanding their sales. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, May and June fell slightly by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, July fell by 5 li, August fell by 2.5 li, and September remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Red Grains Suddenly Rise Six or Seven Fen <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Futures Cake Rises and Falls Again</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Dark盤 Turns</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the soybean cake market opened in the morning, it rose by about one fen compared to the previous day due to good news from Dalian telegraph. However, it fell again because of poor actual sales and no activity from mainland merchants. When the market opened in the afternoon, it weakened again because mainland factories slightly sold out and current cake sales were stagnant. Industry insiders speculated that the subsequent market would be small. As a result, May fell by 7.5 li, and the last period of June fell by 2.5 li. The inventory of red grains in Niuzhuang was not large, and few new arrivals were available. The entire market only had seven or eight vehicles, which were picked up by Jiangbei merchants yesterday, causing the market to rise suddenly, with prices opening at 3.45 yuan to 3.43 yuan. Soybean oil remained quiet but active. Yesterday's market buying sentiment suddenly livened up, and brokers intended to tighten the market, so the market turned around compared to the previous day. A total of 250 pieces of Dalian oil were sold, priced at 14.83 yuan, 130 pieces of Niuzhuang oil at 16 yuan, and 200 pieces of Qi soybean oil at 14.62 yuan.</p>

<p>New Cotton Red Inventory is Dry, Sales are Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw no major changes in gold prices, and market sentiment was stable. However, foreign sugar sales were weak, and the market was tired. The association quoted the price for 24 coarse sand white sugar as 21.2 yuan and the price for 20 medium sand white sugar as 20.06 yuan, a slight decrease of one jiao. 89 Holland red sugar was still quoted at 17 yuan. Transactions were very ordinary. Other domestic sugar goods, such as new cotton red sugar, had 100+ packages imported by the Hesheng ship the day before yesterday. They were immediately sold at prices of 16.4 yuan, 16.3 yuan, and then 16.15 yuan. The bottom of the Chao Merchants inventory has dried up, so sales are very lively. Dozens of packages of foreign sugar have also been opened, with prices quoted at 19.07 yuan.</p>

<p>The woolen fabric market has seen ups and downs. As there are too many varieties, only herringbone woolen fabrics, which have a low inventory and are difficult to find, showed elegance yesterday. The market for plain yellow fabrics was also strong, while the market for plain gray and striped fabrics was also stable. Checked woolen fabrics were outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Various red, green, and blue flashy woolen fabrics are no longer popular in Shanghai and have no buyers even when prices are reduced. Blue plain woolen fabrics are weaker than plain yellow and gray. The market for herringbone striped fabrics used in Western suits is very elegant, and sales are strong. Samples are sold at fourteen or fifteen yuan per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Sichuan Cloth Sales Resume Activity <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Western holidays in recent days, Western merchants and import traders have closed their doors as usual, preventing the shipment of woolen fabrics. However, existing inventory and pre-sold woolen goods are being transacted daily. The Sichuan sectors within the warehouses of Taikoo Yu, Jardine Yu, Da Chuan Tong, Yi Ji, Xiang Yu Gong, Xie Ji Xing, and Hui Ji Xing currently have sampling needs. Significant purchases are being made for plain serge, woolen fabrics, straight tribute cloth, and overcoat cloth. The Sichuan sectors have not been active since last winter, and now seem to have a desire to move after a period of quiet. It is expected that there will be a huge buying spree at the beginning of next month.</p>

<p>Wenzhou is the largest exporter of black tea in Zhejiang Province. The tea-producing areas include Shuijia, Pingyang, Qingtian, Shushui, Suichang, Yunhe, and Yueqing counties. In the past two years, the export volume of black and green tea has been about 20,000 boxes. However, because mountain farmers do not pay much attention to tea tree cultivation and the methods are crude and wasteful, most of the products are rough and inferior. Compared with those produced in Xiushui and the two lakes, they are far inferior. Coupled with the dumping of low-value Indian and Ceylon tea to Europe and the United States, Wen Hong has been greatly affected. Last year, Wenzhou black tea was overpriced, and sales prices were low, causing tea merchants to suffer as much as those in Qi. This year, black tea in the area is being launched. According to news from Wendi merchants, tea merchants are less interested than before due to last year's losses and are reluctant to enter the market. The number of merchants is decreasing, not increasing. Moreover, financial resources in the mountains are dry, and tea shops and money houses are not lending as easily as in previous years. In the future, mountain prices may fall, and there may be a turnaround in overseas tea markets, which may become more active. At this time, there is no expansion of new situations.</p>

<p>Red and green teas in Qimen, Zhide, Wuyuan, Xiuning, and Shexian in Anhui Province used to sprout mostly before the Qingming Festival due to the warm climate in the past. In recent years, the climate in the producing areas has become colder, and tea buds have developed later than before. Since the end of last month, the weather has been extremely cold, like severe winter. The tea trees have been held back by the cold and cannot sprout in time. However, recently, the weather has suddenly turned warm, and it has been raining for days. The tea trees in the gardens have been nourished by the warmth and moisture, and the branches have revealed green buds. According to agriculturalists, tea trees in barren and old land were severely damaged by the severe cold of last winter. The trees have more dead, yellow, and old leaves on the branches and will not fully develop this year. It is expected that the yield of these damaged tea trees will definitely not be high. If the weather is abnormal in the future and cannot be remedied in order, the harvest will inevitably be affected.</p>

<p>Recently, because various merchants from Sichuan and Hankou have been purchasing chess copper, the market has faced a shortage of goods, and prices have risen sharply by one yuan, selling at 310 yuan. Yesterday, there were as many as forty or fifty dan sold on the market. However, current overseas prices are high, and few peers are buying, so the future market may rise further.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Further Discussion on the Root Cause of China's Problems (Part 1) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>The last "Amateur Musings" mentioned that the root cause of China's problems lies in the fact that the vast majority of the country's people do not have enough to eat and are heading towards starvation and national demise. Although not having enough to eat is a common symptom in various large and small powerful countries today (it is said that there are no unemployed people in the Soviet Union, which should be an exception. I dare not flatter the Red allies, but that is the fact), the Northeast and Jehol have been occupied one after another. A powerful neighbor has already entered the house, but a portion of the national populace and the majority of government leaders still complain and blame heaven, and they continue to fight for profit as before, displaying a tendency to not know to rise up and save themselves until death. This kind of strange symptom that completely lacks national consciousness is unique to our China. If the reason for this symptom is not clarified, we will never be able to extricate ourselves from death.</p>
<p>We believe that the formation of this special symptom can be attributed to the following two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The bankruptcy of various systems that maintain national consciousness;</p>
<p>(2) The culture that maintains national independence is gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>We know that the independence and greatness of a nation depend entirely on the existence of various political, social, or religious systems that maintain the unity of that nation. A certain system, even if it is conservative and does not conform to political or economic trends, as long as it is used properly and can continue to be improved, will not harm the independence and greatness of the nation. For example, the survival of the Jewish people and the struggle of the Indian nation depend entirely on the maintaining power of their religious systems. Although the British political system still has the name of the emperor, it does not harm the development of his democratic spirit. In addition, such as the dictatorship in Italy and the recent political changes in Germany, although many scholars criticize how backward or regressive they are based on democratic or socialist standpoints, they still represent an independent system of national consciousness. If this system is harmful to the development of the nation, a new system will naturally emerge to replace it, without harming the independence and greatness of the nation. What is the current situation in our China? The existing (imitating others') political system has a name but lacks actual spirit. The economic system is subject to the aggression of capitalist imperialism from the outside and the influence of political chaos from the inside. Therefore, the original rural system, handicraft system, and family system that maintained national economy and slightly maintained national consciousness are gradually disappearing and heading towards bankruptcy. In addition, the religious system has no special influence in China, so we feel that the first reason for the special symptoms of China today is the bankruptcy of the system. There is no good system, no system that conforms to the trend, and no bad system, no backward system either. For example, the autocratic regime of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, as a backward system, was destined to be crushed and destroyed by the wheels of the times, which is an iron fact and cannot be denied. However, the autocratic system, even as bad as that of the Manchu Qing, did not completely lose the solemn discipline inherent in the system itself. You see that after the naval commander Ding Ruchang lost the battle of the Sino-Japanese War, he still knew the law of responsibility and could resolutely commit suicide to atone for his country and apologize to the people. In fact, precisely because if he did not commit suicide, he would not be able to avoid death. On this point alone, it can be said that the system itself has not shown complete bankruptcy. But today is different. The responsible parties for the loss of several provinces can still leisurely travel overseas amidst the cheers of important figures. The government has no intention of punishing them, and the public has no power to sanction them. Therefore, the bankruptcy of the entire political and social system can be said to be completely exposed.</p>
<p>We know that the promotion of a national spirit and its ability to strive for survival must all rely on the leadership of a system. Without a system, its operational effectiveness will be lost, and the self-confidence in national struggle will gradually disappear. We feel very painfully that the current situation of the Chinese nation is very close to this trend. Regarding the second reason for the special symptoms of China today, due to space limitations, we will leave it for discussion in the next "Amateur Musings."</p>

<h3 id="e245">How Xi Guansheng Succeeded <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xiang</p>
<p>From the perspective of the modern world, it can be said that Xi Guansheng, who started as an apprentice and achieved his current status, is a success story. Although this success was due to objective circumstances, his own spirit of hard work is worthy of our analysis and study.</p>
<p>He came to Shanghai as an apprentice more than twenty-five years ago, and now he is the owner of Guanshengyuan with a capital of 300,000. To study the reasons for his success, the following points are essential:</p>
<p>First, fighting against failure: In the process of his initial entrepreneurship, there were two failures. The first was in Nanshi, and the second was on Nanjing Road, both food shops closing down. The difficulties and hardships experienced during that time were truly indescribable. However, when he formed the Guanshengyuan Food Company for the third time, although the capital was only a few hundred yuan, he was able to change his previous exaggeration and adopt a down-to-earth approach, starting from small things as his business policy, and finally succeeded. This experience of "starting from small things" can be said to be a lesson learned from two failures.</p>
<p>Second, attending the university of society: Xi Guansheng once said in a speech about his learning spirit that he had also attended a university, but not a national or public one, but the university of society. He had been to Peiping and Nanjing. Every time he went to a place, he would study the local food and analyze the tastes of the local people to produce food that suited their needs. Therefore, Peiping and Nanjing were his universities. From this point of view, on the one hand, it proves his spirit of learning and research, and on the other hand, it also proves that his success is based on social needs.</p>
<p>Third, treating shop assistants equally: This is also very important to Xi Guansheng's success. He treats all the staff in the shop not only kindly but also equally. Not only equally, but also educating the staff. Because of this, the staff of Guanshengyuan were able to help him succeed and promote his success. At the same time, the large amount of profit he earned was not entirely put into his own pocket, but a lot was distributed to the staff.</p>
<p>A person like Xi Guansheng is indeed a good model for apprentices and shop assistants. His diligence, fearlessness of difficulties, and the spirit of sharing food with everyone are indeed something that ordinary people cannot do. At the same time, he is also very simple in his self-sufficiency, wearing old cloth robes, cloth shoes, etc., maintaining the same state as before his success. This is indeed something that ordinary people find difficult to learn and difficult to do!</p>

<p>Baihu Village is a village with a dozen or so families living in the middle of a valley. People near Baihu Village have a saying: "Small Baihu Village, wives support husbands; wives carry salt to sell, men are playing cards." These words reflect that women are not incapable.</p>
<p>Indeed, the women of Baihu Village are strong and their muscles are firm; they do not walk weaker than men. They, regardless of old or young, can carry a load of fifty or sixty catties of white salt. They have always relied on this salt-selling life.</p>

<p>They do not feel pain in this way of life. Because they carry salt out in the morning and sell it all by evening. They use the money they earn to buy rice and fish for their husbands and sons to eat their fill.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, their lives have not been as pleasant as in the past. Because when they carry salt on the streets or on the country roads, shouting: "Do you want salt?" they are often caught and beaten by the water police, who also take away the salt. They are even detained in prison! In this way, the husbands and sons at home are hungry for a whole night.</p>
<p>They now have a passive resistance method to deal with the water police: they often carry salt together in groups of several people, walking on the streets or roads; when they encounter the water police, they unceremoniously use their thick fists and hard carrying poles to beat the water police to near death, retaliating for the previous beatings.</p>
<p>They can also carry out women's movements. They united all the women in Baihu Village and the women who buy salt nearby, and went to the county government to petition, demanding the abolition of the bad practice of catching salt. Their reason is this:</p>
<p>"The salt is produced locally, can't the local people enjoy the salt produced locally?"</p>
<p>But the county government's answer is: "Salt is public property, so it must be sold publicly like opium."</p>
<h3 id="e248">A Treatise on the Causes of Unemployment for Laborers <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Songfu</p>
<p>The formation of the unemployment problem is a characteristic of the capitalist social organization. In the handicraft era of the feudal system, although there were occasional special and abnormal events that were enough to affect people's occupations and livelihoods, they were only a small part of the population, and there was no other kind of mutual connection. When capitalism developed, most of the proletarians had to abandon their old occupations and gathered from villages and towns to large factories in the cities to become wage laborers. An accident in a large factory is enough to affect the unemployment of many laborers, and the result of unemployment, needless to say, is the misery of the unemployed laborers themselves. In this way, the unemployment problem of laborers has become an important problem in modern society. Therefore, the biggest reason for promoting the unemployment problem is fundamentally the deformity and unreasonableness of the current social organization. The more developed capitalism is, the more alarming the increase in the number of unemployed people. It can be imagined from the large number of people registered in the employment agencies and those who apply for union subsidies in various capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Shinjiro Kitazawa of Japan divides the social causes of unemployment into: (1) seasonal changes in labor demand, (2) cyclical decline in the industrial world, (3) the existence of temporary day labor systems, and (4) changes in overproduction caused by advances in technology and organization. This classification is more universal and suitable. Now, I will briefly explain the social causes of unemployment in these four aspects as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Seasonal changes in labor demand The difference in the degree of prosperity and slackness of most occupations is dominated by time. The difference in the demand for laborers will cause a shortage or surplus of laborers depending on the season of the industry. When a certain industry is prosperous, there is no problem with the working life of the laborers in that occupation: if the industry declines due to climate, social trends, or the trend of the times, laborers will feel a lack of work and unemployment will occur. Most industries are time-sensitive, so this factor has a great impact on the unemployment problem. This is especially true for skilled laborers, because skilled laborers are limited to certain skilled jobs; other occupations are not their strengths.</p>
<p>(2) Cyclical decline in the industrial world In the past economic history, it is clear that the economic society has traces of cyclical decline, prosperity, and decline. The market is dominated by social, economic, geographical, customs, and other factors, and there are often phenomena of decline and prosperity: and this phenomenon sometimes occurs not only in a part of the space, but also has a mutually related force that is enough to involve the overall situation, such as the successive closures of my country's yarn factories in the past few years. Once the market in the economic society declines, the unemployment situation of laborers is very terrible.</p>
<p>(3) The existence of temporary day labor systems Temporary day laborers can also be said to be unemployed people who get temporary work, which is also an infrequent and accidental thing, because each factory has sufficient long-term contract workers in places that need workers, and there are very few places that need temporary day laborers. These workers do not have fixed long-term occupations, and most of them wait near factories, companies, stations, docks, etc., waiting for someone to hire them. The coolies on the wharves of the Huangpu River in Shanghai are a part of this type of worker.</p>
<p>(4) Changes in overproduction caused by advances in technology and organization The invention of machinery, the advancement of production methods and production systems can reduce the consumption of production and increase the output of products. As a result, the excess of laborers and their skilled skills become unnecessary, and some laborers have to suffer the tragedy of unemployment.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Dear readers: Nowadays, many people of your same status, when they have free time, either flip through newspapers to find news such as rape, or talk to others about everything about women. But you are able to use your free time to read this magazine, which I admire very much.</p>
<p>When you see that the "Self-Employment Introduction" column in this magazine is often full, and that even in the United States, which is called the Golden Country, there are millions of unemployed workers; while on the other hand, in a country that occupies one-sixth of the earth - the Soviet Union, not only is there not a single unemployed person, but there is a need for a large number of workers to work, etc., you may wonder about all these phenomena in your heart, but you cannot answer how these phenomena occur. Among you, some have studied in schools, but the teachers will not tell you the reasons for all social phenomena; not to mention those who have not attended school. And what about your bosses or senior brothers? I am afraid that there are very few who can accurately answer these social phenomena; some simply do not know what is going on.</p>
<p>Now let me introduce a book "How to Study the New Social Sciences" (edited by Ke Bonian, published by Nanqiang Bookstore, 35 cents per copy). This book, although it cannot immediately tell you the reasons for all the above-mentioned social phenomena; but it will tell you some methods of studying social phenomena. After reading this book, and then gradually selecting and studying according to the bibliography listed at the back of the book, in this way, not only can you get the answers to all the above-mentioned social phenomena, but also other social problems will be answered, and at the same time, your knowledge will be greatly enriched. There is also a book "Introduction to Social Sciences" (edited by Yang Jianxiu, published by Modern Bookstore, 40 cents per copy). Although some parts of this book are not very accurate, it can be used to know what the meaning of society is, what its structure is, and how politics, law, religion, morality, and art occur.</p>
<p>Also, when you have free time, in addition to reading newspapers, you probably read novels such as "Tears and Laughter Marriage" or "Wild River Heroine", but after reading these novels, what are your feelings? Probably not imagining yourself as an affectionate son, or becoming an expert in all kinds of weapons like in the book? When Japan and all imperialists are actively dividing China, these novels will only make people indulge in that kind of fantasy, and in fact, they are destroying the power of the masses to resist Japan and oppose imperialism. The novels that need to be read now should be suitable for the current situation, so I hope you will read novels with profound meaning such as "Volunteer Army", "Midnight", "Cement", "Iron Flow", "Collapse", "Brosky", etc.</p>
<p>Appendix: If you encounter many new terms when reading books, such as "capitalism", "socialism", "historical materialism", etc., you can refer to the "New Terminology Dictionary"! It should be available in the library of this newspaper!</p>

<p>Since Ms. Zhu Yongli's article "Please Save a Girl" was published in the 16th issue of this magazine, the Hengfeng Yarn Factory has repeatedly sent letters to make corrections and Ms. Zhu has sent letters to clarify. The details have been seen in the previous issue of this magazine. Now, many letters from all parties regarding this matter have been received, but due to various reasons, except for the full disclosure of the factory's letters below, the remaining letters are not convenient to publish. I hope readers will understand!</p>

<p>To Mr. Liangcai, Editor:</p>
<p>Respectfully, your newspaper's amateur weekly published on the 2nd and 9th of this month the letter from female worker Zhu Yongli and our factory. We would like to invite Qing. Yesterday, I was afraid that I would not be able to express myself clearly on the phone, so I will extend it as follows: 1. Your newspaper's establishment of a job introduction column to serve the society is very good. However, the letter writers are arbitrarily attacking the previous employers in order to seek employment. The reporter does not investigate and publishes it at will, whether it is in line with the original intention of Mr. setting up this column. 2. The article said "There is a certain time limit even for going to the toilet." Has the reporter of your newspaper investigated and confirmed this kind of unfounded slander? This kind of harsh system is not only absent in our factory, but even prisons cannot implement it for prisoners. 3. There are nearly 3 million residents in Shanghai, and there is no day without layoffs. Now, a female worker with low skills who left the factory eight months ago is using your newspaper's valuable pages to make sensational remarks, hoping to win the sympathy of the society, and your newspaper is also willing to be used by her, which is deeply regrettable. I have always known and loved you, dare to send my humble sincerity, and I am extremely terrified to see the end of the film. I respectfully wish you peace and good health.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Nie Lusheng</p>
<p>Editor's note: The object of this magazine is the entire society, not any individual. Therefore, for contributions from all parties, as long as the content is substantial and related to the improvement of workers' lives, regardless of whether the contributor is the "employer" or "male and female workers", we are happy to publish it. Our only wish is to use this small publication as a mirror for society. Especially regarding the self-employment introduction column, we are not only standing in the position of a third party, strictly maintaining neutrality, not making judgments, and not taking sides; we fundamentally have no preconceived notions of right and wrong, but just give the unemployed an opportunity to shout. I am sincerely afraid of causing misunderstandings between the two parties, and I have to add a few words to clarify my attitude; I do not dare to say that I have any rebuttal to anyone or any aspect.</p>

<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>I, who have an unfortunate destiny, no, I, in this turbulent, economically collapsing, and increasingly unemployed society, have just spent a lot of effort and relied on the help of friends to find a place to eat. I thought that "three meals a day and seven feet to sleep" would not have to worry for a year or half a year. Who knew that "the sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes in the morning and evening." Before completing a month of service, suddenly the order to "make a list and hand over" came down. Alas, this is no different from pouring a bucket of cold water on my back and hitting my rice bowl with a stick. Although the handover period has not yet arrived, my luggage will finally grow legs and move around soon - at the end of April. Following that, "three meals a day and seven feet of sleep" will all shoot like arrows at my cowardly soul for the sake of supporting "weak life"?</p>
<p>Of course, in the dead of night, when tossing and turning in bed, I keep thinking; even during the day, while working, I cannot but consider the future problems. Because the strange phenomenon in society is that bread is not there waiting for you to take it, let alone dream that it can reach your mouth. You must sharpen your head and use all your energy to grab it. But what is the use of using all your energy? Ordinary people have already got it first! Ordinary people borrowed the hands of others and took it in their own hands! Ordinary people relied on the strength of others to get it... Now, it is like "a patient competing with a strongman" to think that a cowardly person like me can use his fists and feet to compete with others for bread in this strange society. Isn't it ridiculous and pitiful? Sometimes I think it is better to commit suicide, but "suicide is a cowardly act, a useless person who cannot fight", "Heaven gave me talent, it must be useful", etc., ideas occupy my mind again. Because I am confident that although I am not a "perfect and omnipotent" youth, I have a superb will and will definitely have some achievements. Cowardly? Useless person? How can I be willing to accept it. Heaven gave me talent, it must be useful! However, my situation is like this, what is the use after all? These, these thoughts, like surging waves, are constantly rising and hitting in my mind!</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation is like this, recalling the past situation, I was just fighting in an environment of thorns and thorns, and the result is the current situation. Then, what will happen in the future? According to the public rule of "knowing the past, knowing the present, and inferring the future", I am not as good as before now, and of course the situation will get worse and worse in the future. Alas! What will happen in the future?·········</p>
<p>As for my skills, in addition to being proficient in the money industry, I also know a little about the oil and wine industry; I also know a little about writing, and I often publish articles in the supplements of the Wuxi National Herald and the Xi Bao. Also, I can write Wei inscriptions, and I can write more than a thousand characters per hour in pen, and I have a rough knowledge of English. I am now willing to work as an assistant editor or proofreader in a newspaper (I have experience), a bank or money shop employee, a company or school clerk or accountant, etc. Provide food and accommodation, salary is not counted. Correspondence address This publication will forward.</p>

<h3 id="e256">My Humble Opinion on The Sign of the Cross <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>I believe that whether you are a Christian or a non-Christian, everyone who has seen The Sign of the Cross will have a very deep impression. Although it has a strong religious color, in terms of film and drama art, this film can be said to be a masterpiece of the great director Cecil B. DeMille, and it is also a rare masterpiece in the film industry for several years.</p>
<p>I have often asked myself why Christianity has been so powerful in European and American countries for thousands of years, and why the piety of European and American people who are so scientifically advanced has lasted for so long. Historians say that Western civilization is formed by the fusion of two elements: Christian doctrine and Greek scholarship. Cecil B. DeMille's The Sign of the Cross film maximizes this essence.</p>
<p>Religion is originally a personal matter, and it is also a part of social life. Cecil B. DeMille's film takes religion as its position, and other films take love or crime as their position. There is not much relationship in film art. Starting from this point of view to criticize The Sign of the Cross, Cecil B. DeMille's description of the conflict between non-religion and religion in the cultural history of Europe at that time is very profound. Rome at that time was the most powerful force representing the so-called The Pagan World. The greatness and barbarism of Rome met the intrusion of Jesus' spirit of universal love. In the plot of The Sign of the Cross, it is lined with interpolation very shocking. A group of men, women, old and young Christians are not subdued by power, singing hymns and bravely facing death calmly. The Roman Governor and the Roman Empress, who were so powerful and invincible, repeatedly tempted them unsuccessfully, but in the end they were conquered by the commoner Christian girl. The two embraced each other and were martyred, concealing the clues that Rome and even the whole of Europe were conquered by the power of Christianity later.</p>
<p>In general, The Sign of the Cross is a historical film that thoroughly depicts an important key to the transformation era of ancient Western civilization. As for other characteristics, I may have places that are not satisfactory due to my personal views or doctrines. Someone has criticized it before, and my intention is only to point out the main purpose of Cecil B. DeMille's direction of this film as I personally saw it. I also think that the translation of this film is very inappropriate.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Ling Hejun's and Si Pingjun's two reviews, one is from a non-Christian, and the other is from a Christian, but both have insightful views. Another thing in common is that they all think that the translation of this kind of film is inappropriate. However, the four words "Romance in the Palace" also have their advantages; the most obvious is an attempt to cover up the heavy religious color, in order to avoid the criticism of our general pagan or even Atheistic people. Or this attempt has other paths to success, so I would like to ask Ling He and Si Ping to try to propose one or two more solemn translations that are in line with the film. If appropriate, it will be published, but this point will never be discussed publicly. Not smart</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e257">On the Silver Screen of the Nanjing Grand Theater <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Yesterday's film change in Nanjing, although advertised with the names of stars Charlie Chaplin and Mitzi Green, was actually more like a short film festival, with a total of five films. The results were very good, as detailed below:</p>
<p>First was the Pathé News Special (Special Contribution), mostly about sports and aviation. There were many magnificent shots of airplanes lined up, which could inspire excitement in us who advocate for national salvation through aviation. Secondly, there was a short film about the customs of the Malay Archipelago. Although not long, it was quite interesting and offered a glimpse into the lives of people in the tropics. The cinematography was very artistic, resembling high-class landscape paintings, unlike the simplicity of ordinary ethnographic films.</p>
<p>Next was a cartoon slapstick film (Charcoal Drawing), which was unremarkable.</p>
<p>After the "Coming Attractions of the Treasures Fair" and the intermission, came "Little Orphan Annie."</p>
<p>The story is very short, telling of a little girl whose father is away on business. To help an orphan in an orphanage, she arranges for the orphan to be taken in by an old woman. She then goes to the old woman's house to play with the orphan. The orphan is unfortunately injured, and she takes care of him. On Christmas Eve, she attends the orphanage's celebration and discovers that the person dressed as Santa Claus is her father, who has returned from afar, and thus the family is reunited.</p>
<p>This is based on a long-running comic strip from an American newspaper. The script and organization are very good. The protagonist is Mitzi Green, and her performance naturally reveals innocence and humor. The most wonderful part is when she plays with the orphan, she dresses up as the "Marx Brothers" from "A Night at the Opera" in a humorous performance. She also plays a stubborn old woman, with meticulous portrayal. Her talent for imitation is undeniable. Buster Phelps, who plays the orphan, is only five or six years old, but his expressions are already remarkable. Every cry and every smile can win people's sympathy.</p>
<p>The other child actors are also good, and the adult supporting actors can only be considered as backdrops.</p>
<p>The sets are good. The lighting is a bit too dark in some places. The cinematography is excellent. For example, in the scene where the orphan falls from upstairs, the children in the audience show sympathy and laugh. There are no interjections. The whole film has laughter-inducing slapstick and anxiety-inducing tension. As such, it deserves to be called an "Excellent Work."</p>
<p>The ending of this film is immediately followed by the beginning of "Easy Street," a work by Charlie Chaplin from five or six years ago. Presumably, because Chaplin hasn't had any new works in the past two years, and the audience has been longing for him for a long time, the RKO company has revamped it, adding beautiful music to meet the need.</p>
<p>The story of the slapstick film is empty. It depicts Chaplin as a police officer who, fortunately, cleverly defeats a strongman, and is thus admired by the people. That's all there is to it in the three reels of film. There's nothing to say about the directing. The lighting, cinematography, sets, and makeup are all simple and immature, far below today's standards. But even though it is immature, the coherence and contrast are very good (half of the poor lighting, etc., is due to the fact that it's an old film being re-released). I haven't seen Chaplin's signature splayed-foot, coolly humorous attitude for five or six years (he has changed his style from "The Gold Rush," "The Kid," to "City Lights"). And I suspect this film may be a work from ten years ago (but I can't say for sure). Anyway, although this film is unreasonable, full of loopholes, and forced slapstick, it is ultimately not unbearable. A genius artist can still display his genius!</p>
<p>Of the five films, "Little Orphan Annie" is the longest and best. Although the music in "Easy Street" is very good, it's just average in comparison. In today's environment, it's just a mediocre work.</p>

<p>"Dawn" Also Filmed</p>
<p>Recently, the Tianyi Film Company is planning to move because the open space near the film studio has been developed into a road. The noise of vehicles is constant, which is very detrimental to sound recording. A few days ago, Shao Zuiweng and Qiu Qixiang inspected the Lin Family Garden at the end of Baoshan Road in Zhabei. The location is quiet and sparsely populated, making it a good place for shooting sound films. However, the journey is too far, so they may look for another place. Therefore, a decision has not yet been made.</p>
<p>The script for little sister Liming Hui's second film has been titled "Dawn," which happens to be the same as her name. The script was written by her father, Li Jinhui. The theme of the script is to adopt realistic themes to give a painful cry for the working masses, and at the same time, to expose the oppressive and exploitative means of the propertied class. Qiu Qixiang has been discussing the breakdown of the script and filming ideas with the Li family for days. It is said that filming may begin around the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>If we read ancient European history and look at the part that describes the Roman Empire, who can not feel emotional? Seeing the Christian Crusaders of the Renaissance, who can not be moved? But those orthodox histories are by no means as powerful or as grand as unofficial histories or films, and not as deeply touching. The greatness of director Cecil B. DeMille cannot be denied either. Which of "The Ten Commandments," "The King of Kings," "Forbidden Fruit," and "Volga Boatman" is not glorious? This time, "The Sign of the Cross" establishes DeMille's highest position. In fact, it is better to say that this is a religious film rather than a historical film, and it is better to say that it is an ethical film rather than a religious film. It has extremely profound meaning and extremely beautiful techniques, melting joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness into one furnace, integrating art, thought, ethics, and entertainment into one. How difficult is that? This film is Paramount's unprecedented achievement. In terms of technique alone, it has surpassed "Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>In fact, there are also considerable regrets in the story, but through the director's efforts, it does not affect the dignity or greatness of the whole film at all. Under such a great director, new records have also been created in all other technical aspects. The greatness of the set design and the purity of the lighting are worthy of praise and admiration.</p>
<p>He deliberately makes a startling stroke, which seems to be unrelated to the previous scene, but in the next scene, he immediately connects them with a vivid thread, seamlessly. In terms of cinematography, he never uses novel angles, but the result of the combination is very "beautiful" and solid.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, three of the five protagonists are "Frederic March, Elissa Landi, and Claudette Colbert," genius actors we have long recognized. The other two, Charles Laughton and Vivian Tobin, are new stars and are also exceptionally beautiful. The Boston Daily News commented: "…This is a great film that surpasses any blockbuster. Anyone in the world can appreciate it. Everyone should experience it…" This is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>— Shichun</p>
<p>Lee Tracy is now advocating for not getting married. His reason is that once you have a wife, your life is surrounded by a layer of permanent iron fences and you can't be free. If you marry someone who is not in the film industry, she will definitely not want to live in Hollywood, and she will definitely not be at ease. Because in the film industry, except for old people in their fifties or sixties, someone will definitely fabricate all kinds of romances for you, and inevitably make your wife jealous. If you marry someone in the film industry, that is especially a lifetime of trouble. You have to obey her everywhere. I'm not saying I'll never get married, but the time I work in Hollywood is not the time to get married, because I believe that if you get married, you can't get divorced. I think it's better not to get married than to get married and then divorced.</p>

<p>— Huang Zhongqiang</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I read Ling Hejun's reply to the article about the double-seat rickshaw in the "Madame Butterfly" film. Now I will describe what I know as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, there were two types of rickshaws in Japan. One type was wide and called "share-riding," which is the double-seat rickshaw seen in the Butterfly film. The other type was the ordinary one-person rickshaw called "single-riding." But now this kind of "share-riding" is rare. According to the current progress in Japan, perhaps in a few years, even the "single-riding" will no longer be seen. I read Ling Hejun's reply in this publication about the double-seat rickshaw in the "Madame Butterfly" film. Ling Hejun said that it certainly doesn't exist in Japan, and it seems that he also said that it has never existed since ancient times. I think it may not exist now, but it certainly existed in the past. If Ling Hejun doesn't believe it, he can ask older Japanese people or those who have studied in Japan for a longer period of time. Then you can understand the inside story. (With thanks)</p>
<h3 id="e262">Film Novel "Tarakanova" (5) <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Meihua</p>
<p>Unexpected things often happen. Orlov's disgrace with Catherine is just like Princess Tarakanova's being deceived by Orlov! Because when Orlov was sent to deceive Princess Tarakanova, Catherine could not bear the loneliness in the palace and fell in love with a young and handsome member of the royal family. At this time, Orlov in Catherine's mind was just an obedient subject, not a lovable person she could not be without for a moment.</p>
<p>Princess Tarakanova was bound and taken to the palace like a prisoner who had committed a serious crime. But she was very calm in her heart. She thought: "You are an adulterous woman who murdered her husband. I am the daughter of Queen Elizabeth. Why should I be afraid of you!"</p>
<p>Catherine originally wanted to behead her in a fit of rage, but when she saw her stubborn expression, she knew that she was just a naive and innocent daughter without any schemes. Such a person seemed to have no conspiracy. She must have been deceived by someone. So Catherine said to her: "If you are willing to remove the name of Princess Tarakanova and no longer have excessive delusions, I can let you go."</p>
<p>"What? You can kill me, but you can't take away my name as Princess Tarakanova." As she spoke, she widened her two round eyes, and a fire of desire shot out from those eyes, as if the magnificent furnishings and majestic guards in the palace were all under the command of Princess Tarakanova.</p>
<p>Catherine ordered her to be tied up in prison, stripped of her clothes, exposing her snow-white flesh, and whipped on that skin with a thick whip, one stroke at a time. She cried娇, she turned宛, she struggled, she was angry, she imagined that great figures in history must suffer some hardships. She could only endure the pain, thinking of her lovely and hateful Orlov.</p>
<p>Orlov, under the double oppression of conscience and nervous stimulation, felt extremely ashamed and regretful for Princess Tarakanova. He thought: "Let's commit suicide. But if I commit suicide, she will still be threatened with harsh beatings and live a miserable life. Moreover, besides myself, who else can save her?" When Orlov thought of this, he went to see Catherine again. She seemed to have not seen him for a few days and was still somewhat attached to him. Looking at Orlov's appearance and voice, he was still as moving as before. She unconsciously regained her enthusiasm for him. Orlov concealed his inner pain and accompanied Catherine to make merry, while secretly, because he had regained Catherine's favor and at the same time regained his original prestige, he faked Catherine's order to release Tarakanova, who was dreaming of being a princess.
