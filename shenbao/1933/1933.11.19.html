<h3>十六年邦交一大轉捩美正式承認蘇俄　白宮深夜雙方換文　互示合作維持和平　彼此保證不干内政　俄境美僑信仰自由　債務問題留待日後解决　俄允放棄軍事賠償要求　布立特任美國首任駐俄大使</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日午後發表，美國已由總統與蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫互換公文、正式承認蘇維埃社會主義聯帮共和國、此項換文、實際係在十六日晚十一時五十分、而自彼時起、兩國即已恢復正式外交關係、重續十六年中之邦交、結束一星期來美總統與李氏之談話、</p>
<p>復交換文八件此次兩國復交、共有文件八種、首即美總統與李維諾夫之復交換文、彼此通知樂於恢復邦交、希望兩國永以正常與友誼方式互相合作、謀彼此之福利、而維世界之和平、次爲</p>
<p>第二種換文、保證彼此不干涉内政、俾美國獲有不受共産宣傳之擔保、再次爲</p>
<p>第三種換文、彼此保障對方人民在其境内完全信仰自由、</p>
<p>第四種爲正式議定書、規定商訂一設置領事條約、對在俄美僑給予其他外僑所享之同樣公民權利、</p>
<p>第五種互認李維諾夫之備忘錄、李氏在備忘錄内、答復美總統口頭詢問、切實申明蘇俄關於經濟私諜案件之訴訟手續、</p>
<p>第六種爲一協定書、蘇俄凖備謀美國債權要求與蘇俄相對要求之最後解决、保證對於影響俄政府債務之法庭判决或官廳行囊、不再提出他種要求、</p>
<p>第七種爲李維諾夫之聲明書、聲明蘇俄不使美政府負擔一九一八年美兵在西伯利亞活動所致財産損害之責任、最後</p>
<p>第八種爲美總統與李維諾夫聯署之共同聲明書、聲明兩人對於兩國間一切懸而未决之債務與要求等問題解决方法、業已交換意見、希望其迅得解决、</p>
<p>按李維諾夫之不干涉内政換文内、蘇俄所負任務、遠比一般意料者爲廣、蘇俄曾保證勿容其人民、作志在破壞美國領土完整或陰謀强迫變更美國政治或社會秩序之無論何種活動、</p>
<p>又關於第三種換文内、美總統通知李維諾夫、期望美僑之居於蘇俄者、將得最完全之完敎自由、連同敎士及其他執行宗敎職務人員之保護、不致因其宗敎地位而被拒入境、李氏答稱、蘇俄凖備允諾此種自由達於最完全之限度、</p>
<p>按美俄昨夜換文復交後、今晨李維諾夫又赴白宮與美總統會晤兩小時、迨其自白宮而出、即語新聞記者云、渠揣想總統將於午後有所聲明、同時又答新聞記者之詢問、謂渠無意赴溫泉、因此咸料今日午後當可正式發表復交消息（十七國民電）</p>
<p>聯名發表公報（華盛頓）美國已在法理上承認蘇聯政府、羅斯福總統宣稱、美俄兩國代表於昨晚十一時五十分成立恊定、總統又謂美俄復交之後、美國第一任大使將以國務院助理員布立特任之、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統與蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫對於下列各項主要問題、即宣傳信仰自由·兩國僑民在法律上所受保護·查究經濟上間諜行爲·及雙方所提要求各事曾交換函件、頃已公佈、按之此項函件、蕪聯政府對於美國前向西伯利亞進兵一舉所提損害賠償之要求、業已放棄、羅斯福總統與李維諾夫頃又會銜發表公報稱、「吾人除於本日簽訂復交恊定外、對於其他懸案、如債務曁雙方所提要求、亦曾交換意見、俾覓獲解决方案、而將兩國政府所願迅速滿意解决各項問題、儘速予以確定之解决云云、李維諾夫仍當勾留數日、俾賡續進行談話（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>首任駐俄美使（華盛頓）迨復交消息旣經公布、白宮立即發表任國務卿帮辦布立特（即蒲里德）爲第一任駐俄大使、按照美國憲法、承認外國、總統得便宜行事、故日前兩國所商定者、可以拘束美國不必再待國會之核准、惟派布立特爲駐俄大使、必須經參院同意、又關於駐俄使領館經費及克倫斯基政府一萬八千七百萬美金借欵之解决、其最後准否之權、亦握於國會云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>布立特氏略歷</h3>
<p>（東京）　美俄復交後第一次駐俄美國大使布立特、世間卒少知其經歷、然布氏爲美國中最精通蘇俄事情者之一人、現任美國國務長官特别補佐官之職、羅總統今次與李維諾夫交涉時、絕對禁止任何人物參加會談、然獨有布氏時時列席於其間、進言種種意見、布氏曾於列寗在世時、代表美國赴俄直接會見列寗解决種種懸案、今次美俄復交交涉當初、各方面均以爲現駐拉都維亞公使馬克馬萊氏被任爲駐俄大使、然突見布氏之任命、實爲意外之事也、羅總統起用布氏、可窺其對俄態度之如何愼重也、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>新任駐俄大使布立特初爲新聞記者、任費城公論報編輯員國外訪員及華盛頓訪員等職、一九一七年爲國務院助理員、次年赴歐充美國議和代表團隨員、一九一九年奉特别使命游俄、現年四十二、係雅魯大學生（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>俄方對美讓步　放棄軍事損害要求　換取領土暗中担保</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間若干消息靈通者說明蘇俄之放棄一九一八年美國出兵西伯利亞損害要求、爲　方之讓步、以換取美國贊助維持蘇俄現有領土之暗中擔保、而蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫亦於今夜承認此項問題、曾在白宮談話中占重要地位、惟其與美總統諒解之内容、則不允洩露、然當此日俄在邊境常起糾紛之際、即李氏此種承認亦極有重大意味者也、</p>
<p>現蘇俄旣放棄出兵西伯利亞之損害要求、保證不干涉内政及允美僑完全宗敎自由、已除去兩國絕交十六年之三大要素、惟兩國間其他重要問題仍多大半屬於財政方面、故聞李維諾夫擬再留居華盛頓數日、俾與國務院及財政部中人繼續討論、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>李維諾夫對美記者談話　暗示日對俄不信任　足以釀成反常行動</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日下午李維諾夫在美國新聞俱樂部會見各報代表一千餘人、表示欲令兩國復交造成眞正友誼之决心、並有數種事態、含有不信任與惡感、推其極、有時足以釀成極反常之行動者、刻正在正當關係之下滋長培養之語、衆認此語係指目前日俄關係而言、並謂渠與美總統及國務院諸公談話中所同意者、已開啓迅速圓滿解决兩國間一切懸案途徑、吾人在發展眞正友誼與和平合作之關係上、已另開一新頁、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>談判主要議題　遠東時局促進兩國提携　債務問題不難從容解决</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美俄兩國復交談判、由羅斯福總統與蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫主持進行、已歷十日之久、頃美國已承認蘇聯政府與之恢復外交關係、而將十六年以來世界兩大共和國斷絕關係之局面、予以結束此雖極明顯之事、惟美俄兩國代表談判情形極爲秘密、究以何者爲議題、旣難斷定、其結果何若尤未可知、此際所可知者、則美俄兩國代表、業已談判俄國債務、共産主義宣傳、及保護美國僑民各問題、而宣傳與保護美僑兩問題、似已從容解决、至第一問題、則將指派專家組織委員會、從事研究、此外關於經濟問題之談判所得結果、未必盡如若干美國人士所希望、一俄國苟欲購買大批美貨、自非美國予以鉅額墊欵不可、而美國政府似未凖備及此、抑美俄兩國談判尙有最重要、而又最秘密之問題、即國際政局尤其是遠東時局是也、關於此層、俄日兩國關係、「滿洲國」及海軍各項問題·自居首要地位、羅斯福總統原本有與蘇俄談判復交之計畫、旋因遠東時局緊張情形、已達危險程度、乃提前予以實行、而與蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗交換函電、蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫爰乃翩然蒞止、此層實可斷定、查蘇聯政府截至目前爲止、對於尙未予以承認各國堅决拒絕一切談判、此次李維諾夫竟於恢復外交關係之前、允將兩國間一切問題從長討論、則羅斯福總統在外交上、實已獲有勝利明矣、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本對俄軟化　研究利用傀儡出面　與俄訂不侵犯條約</h3>
<p>（東京）　「滿洲國」大使館參事官谷正之今晨赴外務省訪問重光次官、報告幷接洽最近之情勢、會見後對記者談話如下、外傳日本將關東州及滿鐵附屬地之行政權歸還「滿洲國」之說完全係誤報、並非事實、「滿國」因經濟的開發幷國内政治、最需要和平、故由此見地、謀圓滿解决中東路問題、幷認眞研究與俄締結不侵犯條約、故「滿國」於俄滿邊境毫無軍備但俄方則置有相當嚴重之軍備、然余確信現於俄滿决不致發生任何事態也云、（十八日電通電）</p>

<h3>團結與負責（二）</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>昨旣述團結與負責之意義。而言中央政府已負起責任以當難局矣。今日政府所當之難局。第一責任爲努力於剿匪。然勦匪不能僅恃前敵之軍隊也。一方面在使國内不發生意外之枝節。以妨碍剿匪之工作。一方面在各省各地當局。努力於防禦匪之竄擾與肅清後方之匪。以安地方人民。而地方人民則亦應一致努力於後方一切之工作。維持後方治安。即所以間接恊助剿匪。能如此則剿匪之舉。必易成功。然而非先全國一致團結不可。</p>
<p>所謂國内發生意外之枝節者。即如近日所傳閩省事變之醞釀是也。惟此閩省事變之消息。内幕究竟如何。目前尙未明瞭。假使其醞釀而果如外間所宣傳。又假使此醞釀經開誠布公之調解而竟不見效者。則政府必以兵力壓平。用兵必相爭。爭必蹂躪地方。而使人民受痛苦。非特人民受痛苦而已。剿匪工作。亦必受其影響。而使正將告成之工作。又復稽遲。故在今日嚴緊之局勢下。内亂萬不可以再起。且傳醞釀閩變之中心爲十九路軍。十九路軍抗日之役。所以博得全民之同情而爭先恐後以援助之者。爲其能救國也。事平之後。又曾聲言不參加内戰。其意即所以表明除抗日外别無他意。尤爲國人所贊成。今乃忽傳閩省事變之消息。則誠足令人駭異。蓋在今日政府之所以特别注重剿匪者。正爲欲救國之故。如若再起内爭。致妨害剿匪工作。則非特與不參加内戰之旨不符。且與救國之義。似亦有所矛盾。倘曰政府之辦法。不能救國。則試問十九路軍。將有何辦法以救國。無辦法而謀所以醞釀政變。將與專心搗亂之徒又何以異夫人民苦兵禍久矣。受水旱盜匪之災深矣。目前但求苟安。而不願地方再有　舉動。以妨碍其治安。故昔日聞十九路軍抗日之役。人民不勝其歡欣踴躍以輸助之者。今將因參加内戰之故。而一反從前之態度。十九路軍豈無明白利害之人。而乃冒昩若是。深爲吾人所不解。故在内容眞相尙未大明以前。吾人不敢貿然爲過分之推測。與確定之判斷。以俟將來明白宣佈後再行論定可耳。</p>
<p>吾人今姑置閩事不問。而專論各省當局對於所負剿匪之責任。則其關係亦甚重大。蓋今日之剿匪工作。不僅恃中央前敵各軍之進展。而尤賴粤閩等省之恊力進攻。假使恊攻不力。則非特前敵各軍不得援助之力。且恐其竄擾以掣前方之肘。此爲各省各地之軍隊所應努力者。至於一般人民。無不希望解除國難。希望進行一切建設。希望工商業發展。希望地方秩序安寗。然第一步必須剿匪成功。欲剿匪成功。必須在後方之人民。一致奮起努力援助。欲人民一致援助。則非此一盤散沙之情形所能有濟。故必須先鼓勵精神團結。起而共負此一重大之責任。</p>

<h3>美俄談判成功羅斯福赴溫泉</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統、業已啓程赴溫泉休息、羅氏與蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫互換照會、頃已發表、李維諾夫用書面保證蘇聯政策、對於美國自行决定其生存之權利、澈底加以尊重、蘇聯絕對不干預美國及其屬地事務、凡蘇俄官吏或蘇俄政府直接間接管理之人員所作宣傳、其目的在侵犯美國領土、或以暴力變更美國政治組織者、蘇聯政府一律加以阻止、除華盛頓政府之外、凡自稱代表美國政府之團體、或謀以暴力推翻美國政府之團體、均不許其在蘇俄國的存在、或在蘇俄國境内從事組織各項組織、凡以使用暴力傾覆美國政治社會秩序爲目的者、並不許其存在於蘇聯境内、至羅斯福總統覆文、則保證美國對於蘇聯、當遵循同樣政策、此外另有照會一件、專論宗敎問題、蘇聯對於美國籍人民、准其在蘇俄境内建造敎會、所用房屋且得收受用於宗敎目的之捐欵、又關於設置領事條約、適用最惠國待遇、以保護僑民各事、亦經雙方互換意見、即俄國以前迭屆政府、對於美國所可要求之私債權、蘇俄政府、不無提起訴訟之權利、茲亦承認抛棄之、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福與李維諾夫交換之照會中、蘇聯政府雖放棄對於美國在西伯利亞出兵干涉之要求、但此項干涉、並不包含美國在阿千琪爾斯克之干涉在内、對於此次干涉、蘇聯政府仍維持其對美之要求、按一九一八年美國政府曾派兵七千人在海參崴登陸、目的在於阻止該地德國俘虜重行武裝、以抵抗協約軍、故遣遠征軍、當時美國遠征軍司令奉命對於白俄與赤俄之衝突、守嚴格之中立狀態、但美兵四千七百人在阿千琪爾斯克登陸後、曾實際參加對蘇維埃軍隊作戰、此次遠征美國軍隊陣亡者二百人、受傷三百人云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄署赤旗迎風招展</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　美俄復交後第一顯著之徴象、即爲蘇俄赤色國旗、已於今日下午颶颶於此間俄大使署之上、蓋該署已於今日由國務院正式移交與李維諾夫接收矣、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本强作鎭靜</h3>
<p>（東京）　今晨東報載稱、美國昨日承認俄國、李維諾夫與羅斯福發共同聲明書、日外務省當局談云、美俄復交予歐洲政局莫大影響、美俄兩國均爲自國經濟復興起見、企圖接近、固不足怪、世上有謠傳美俄復交、在於牽制日本之對華政策、使遠東和平政策有所變動、但日本對俄政策仍取和平手段、解决兩國之紛爭、故美俄復交於日無干、如此日方極力裝冷靜態度云、（十八日華聯電）</p>
<h3>外務省以美俄軍事合作爲慮</h3>
<p>（東京）　美俄復交問題、日外務省今日發表談話云、美承認俄之主要理由、雖在謀得通商利益、也許有意牽制日在極東之行動、但不致急變對日態度、外傳美俄復交後、俄將撤回中東路出售之提議、不致成爲事實、軍事合作或再舊事重提、但雖屬謠言亦須留心、到一九三六年美俄華必較現在更加接近云（十八日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據東報所傳、美俄兩國在復交接洽中、曾討論日本侵略俄境問題、日方以爲美總統同意擔保俄在遠東保持其國境、其意在於共同防日、兩國交換文書第七件及李維諾夫之談話、足證此事之確實云、（十七日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　外務當局對於美俄復之影響及於遠東政局、正在注視、而大體之觀測如下、（一）美國欲以美俄復交、爲牽制日本之一手段、固毫無疑義、但羅斯福總統當不因此使對日政策、成爲具體的强化也、（一）反之、蘇俄因引誘美國之援助蘇俄、尤以使對日態度更形强化、當大有所得、若最近之撤回北鐵交涉傳說、雖或係宣傳作用、但亦一表現也、（一）今後美俄間能否成立對日恊定、現雖不明、但有去年七月美國承認蘇俄之代價、訂立堪察加設定軍事權益之秘密恊定之傳說、又美國鑑於深恐日本占領蘇俄之沿海州、故日本必須注意及之、（一）因美俄復交之結果、中國之對日態度、當不致急遽變化也、（一）日本根據五相會議之决定、以開發滿洲爲第一義、但爲備萬一計、應與中美俄實施外交工作、（十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>軍事當局謂日本未受任何威脅</h3>
<p>（東京）　日本陸軍當局對於美俄復交、觀測如下、爲世界和平計、深表祝意、因不知復交之條件、不能詳細言之、昔日之債權或將逐次解决、至於美俄接近之對日影響、諒不致較今日更劣也云、（十六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日海軍省當局對美俄復交、今日發表談話謂、美俄兩國復交係時間問題、並不足怪、但日亦不因美俄提携而受何等威脅、且美俄兩國亦不至爲復交而改變其對日態度云、（十八日華聯電）</p>
<h3>俄對日態度益將强硬</h3>
<p>（東京）　美俄兩國清算過去十六年之絕交狀態、正式回復外交關係、日本各方面均最大注意、靜觀前途、現在世界唯一無産者獨裁國之蘇俄、與資本主義國家美國之握手提携、爲國際政局上頗有興味之問題、日本某方面豫料其前途如下、美俄復交之條件、並非訂立不侵犯條約或設定巨大信用制度等具體件條故實際上並無立即發生特别影響、但蘇俄與他國商議之範圍交涉等債權問題、又犧牲共産主義中重要原則之否定宗敎一項、許容美國人之信仰自由而獲得之復交關係、故蘇俄必定利用此復交實行計劃、其間接直接之影響决非輕少也、蘇俄將來對歐洲態度必定强化、尤其對遠東態度更爲强硬、中東路賣買交涉因此不免遷延、其對「滿洲國」態度强硬之結果、兩方之間陸續發生種種糾紛問題、亦未可知、然美國方面對於遠東問題已抛棄所謂史汀生主義、决定方針非有侵害美國利益、並不積極干涉各種問題、且將太平洋艦隊調往大西洋、以計日美間空氣之緩和、故其對遠東究能出於何種積極態度、殊可疑問、美俄復交之結果、遠東及全世界所受之最重大影響、爲蘇俄借用美國豐富財力、進行經濟建設及産業計劃、以謀中國印度及其他諸國之赤化也、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日對僞政策始終不變</h3>
<p>（長春）　關於美國承認蘇俄事、「滿」國軍政部當局之談話如下、設美國承認蘇俄、但於軍政部並不以爲問題、資本主義之美國承認共産主義之蘇俄、係時勢使然、「滿國」根據旣定方針、不得不與日本更堅相提携以應付、若僅處於最惡之情形時、惟有於充實國防用較善之努力云、（十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（長春）　美俄復交事、星野財政部總務司長謂、美國之承認蘇俄、乃當然之事、惟於「滿國」經濟毫無何項影響、俄「滿」間之經濟關係、方漸趨良好、明於對美關係亦方轉佳、故「滿國」始終依照開放門戶機會均等之根本方針、保持對歐美之關、（十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>遠東緊張局勢一服清凉劑　國聯中人表示歡迎</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦方面、今夜莫不歡迎美俄之復交、國聯中人皆信此舉可以自動减少遠東衝突之可能性、惟以兩國俱未入國聯爲憾、此間一般意見、咸認美國此舉、可爲目下猶未與俄復交諸國所取法、逆料不久當有若干國踵起承認蘇俄云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國報紙論調</h3>
<p>（美）（華盛頓）「紐約民聲講壇報」對美俄間所成立之恊定、表示滿意、謂此種恊定使蘇俄政府負美國境内共産黨活動之責任、如于必要時、美國可撤回對蘇聯之承認云、「紐約泰晤士報」社論則歷述一九一八年以來美俄關係之變遷、且有一事尤可注意、即今日「紐約泰晤士報」第二十四頁所載「短訊」中有一段、謂蘇聯國家證劵已可在紐約某大銀行支付利息云（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（英）（倫敦）　今日倫敦報紙　紛紛評美俄復交事、倫敦彙聞報社評稱、兩國親交原因、（一）美國亟需蘇俄市塲、（二）蘇俄亟需美國信用賒貨、（三）兩國在遠東勢力有共同利害、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（德）（柏林）　德文通俗報　今晨評論美俄復交稱、日本亞細亞大陸政策將大受美俄復交之影響、並謂兩國復交後、足以鞏固蘇俄軍事地位、因用美國之經騐與贊助、實現蘇俄發展航空計劃、將有實在價値云云、其他德報亦大致同樣論調、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（意）　羅馬　此間政治評論家　認美俄復交、大有益於美國商務、尤其有利於棉花與紡織品、再美總統與李維諾夫諒解之基礎、雖尙罕有所聞、但信其中必涉及遠東方面政治上之密切合作、或者兩國恊定内、含有軍事性質之條文、以期阻止日人之侵略、亦未可知云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（奥）　維也納　今晨各報　均以廣大篇幅、登載美俄復交消息、但評論尙不多見、「新自由報」誤美俄間成立恊定、並非根據於經濟方面之考慮、對外政策之考慮、實爲兩國接近之重要原因、蘇聯深恐日本一旦把持遠東之局面、或出而戰鬭、亦未可知、羅斯福總統殷勤招待蘇聯外交委員李繼諾夫、對於日本不啻予以警告云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）　　（波蘭）華沙　此間接得美國承認蘇聯之消息、爲時已遲、故今晨波蘭各報　不及加以評論、但政界方面則對于莫斯科與華盛頓之携手、頗表同情、按波蘭前駐蘇俄大使巴德克、爲波蘭與蘇俄不侵犯公約之簽訂者、現任波蘭駐美大使、此次美俄復交、巴德克頗多盡力、總之據一般觀點、美俄之接近、當於世界和平有利云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄向墨西哥交涉恢復外交關係</h3>
<p>墨京　傳聞蘇俄政府正向墨西哥提出交涉、以冀恢復外交關係、外交部對於此一消息旣不否認、亦不加以徴實、按蘇俄外交代表曾在墨西哥從事宣傳、蘇聯與墨西哥國交因而中斷、已數年於茲矣、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本預算困難　海陸軍要求承認全額</h3>
<p>（東京）　陸軍省於二十日前將復活要求提交大藏省、其内容大體如下、（一）滿洲事變費之查定額爲一億二千三百萬、但要求恢復要求額之一億五千六百萬金、（二）資材整備費之查定額爲八千萬、但要求額之一億五千萬金、（三）要求恢復其他新要求中、全被削除之燃料研究費五百萬金等、復活之要求總額、約一億零八百萬金云、（十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　各閣員對於明年度預算、大藏省大加斧鉞之查定、由大局深諒高橋藏相之苦衷、惟海軍部内及農林省内部則有相當不滿、一二日内將與大藏當局接洽恢復要求、若高橋藏相竟完全没却五相會議及内政會議之旨趣、則恐有召政治的危機之虞、故齋藤首相亦深以爲慮、雖十八日爲慣例之週未靜養、亦不前往、將靜觀形勢、或將於高橋藏相大角海相與後藤農相間、親自出馬斡旋、故二十一日之預算閣議、乃延至二十四日、（十八日電通電）</p>

<h3>發表案中意見</h3>
<p>一過、爭執甚烈、自訴人之代理律師聲稱自訴人被非法拘禁、至今已一年有餘、今日可請庭上開釋、恢復自由、結果、庭諭雙方各着交保、聽候改期再訉、幷着被告於三日内將辯訴狀呈案、嗣因昨爲星期六退庭時間已晚、具狀對保、恐時間不及、及由雙方律師請求暫時由律師負責擔保、雙方出外、俟禮拜一再補具正式保狀、經庭上許可、命兩造律師出具負責保證書存案、兩當事人各隨律師出外、自訴人開覺被禁至今、已歷一年一個月、至昨日始得恢復自由、但將來之勝負屬誰、尙難逆料也、</p>

<h3>富華往荻港營救失事之清浦輪　頭清浦艙進水　撞壞荻港碼頭</h3>
<p>三北公司長江船清浦輪、在荻港擱淺、並將荻港碼頭撞壞、情勢頗爲嚴重、各情查記如下、</p>
<p>撞壞碼頭　查清浦輪此次擱淺、係在荻港之漢冶萍碼頭前、失事時、不知如何、駛入漢冶萍碼頭裏擋、在淺灘岸上擱淺、當時船身橫進該碼頭時、以重儎勢激、乃將碼頭一部撞壞、碼頭外擋、停有日郵近海社運裝鐵鑛砂輪一艘、幸未撞碰、至碼頭損壞程度如何、滬上尙未能詳悉、</p>
<p>船頭擱損　清浦擱阻之淺灘、下面並非沙泥、聞係石岸灘、故清浦之重儎輪突然衝進、遂致碰撞頗重、據聞清浦船之頭艙底、已經擱破進水、公司方面對該輪肇禍詳情及損害狀况、未公開宣示、故僅知船身已經擱破、其情勢頗爲嚴重、而詳細狀况、尙不得知、</p>
<p>富華往救　現該輪已無法施救、昨日公司内已議定派新近改造竣工之上游江輪富華號拖帶大號鐵駁、于今晨從上海開出、至荻港將清浦船内貨物及旅客等駁卸來滬、然後再行設法拖救清浦脫險、關于撞壞碼頭等項之損失、則另行調查後核辦、故清浦輪一時殊無脫險之望、</p>

<h3>深秋</h3>
<p>— 王媺女士</p>
<p>才過重九，又是深秋了。</p>
<p>梧桐的葉兒給塗上了紅色，樹枝開始起了抖慄的顫動。景物是那麽荒凉，意戀是那麽黯淡，深秋，深秋帶給人們以衰老。</p>
<p>我獨自在這林子裏徘徊。我要找尋，找尋我遺失得不久的童年。這兒在春天看花朶，紅的白的，開放在地上，也開放在我心上。這兒在夏天有綠葉，疏的密的，蔭蔽着原野，也蔭蔽着我身體。我的四週是和暖的風，我的頭上是光亮的太陽，可是如今，如今只有溪水依舊在流，流向無底的深淵。</p>
<p>没有春，没有夏，也没有我遺留的童年！</p>
<p>我能找到甚麽呢？風是那麽蕭瑟，草是那麽枯黄，我的心隨着落葉飛到了地面，瑟！瑟！瑟！我踐踏着落葉，也踐踏着我的心！</p>
<p>寒鴉帶着寂寞的聲音歸巢了。天邊有一抺殘霞，這使我想起不久以前看見過的二行詩：Ａcross　the　coloured　desert　sky。</p>
<p>Ｏne　lone　bird　flight</p>
<p>大槪這就是深秋吧，多麽蕭棠無味的深秋呵！</p>
<h3>在梧桐葉落的時節</h3>
<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>太陽已失掉它先前强暴的熱力，只贖了一抺淡黄色的光芒深秋的風，一陣銳厲似一陣地刮得呼呼價響，吹到身上感到冷颼颼地，好像風中的寒氣都打從皮膚的汗毛窠内直鑽到心骨。</p>
<p>街頭，再没有女子們的交义雜陳着的玉腿，同時，一般粗笨黝黑的苦力們的大腿也漸漸地消失在人羣的彳亍着的脚步間。秋季大减價，呢絨大减價的旗幟在人頭上迎風亂舞，糖炒栗子，生炒熱白菓，水晶文丹，天津雅耳黎……到處都排列在人們的眼前。那坐在汽車裏的朋友，丨丨他們將身體藏在西裝裏大袍闊服裡的，還有將蛇般的肉體裏在大衣中的都一致在默默中歡迎冬天的快臨，丨丨因爲他們或伊們都需要換換口味啦！</p>
<p>但是，在另一方面正是被「傾」的淫威壓迫着的平民們，却又要將「寒」的一副重擔加上肩去；於是又要便宜長生庫裏做一筆好生意，丨丨夏衣不絕地當進，把冬衣換出來。最苦的，當然又是馬路上的小癟三，他没有大袍闊服，也没有西裝大衣，只有幾隻破蔴袋拿縫起來圍在自己的血和肉上，破蔴袋避不了多少寒風，於是只好揭下牆上的廣告紙權充一下臨時的冬衣，被褥以及帽子。否則，還有什嗎更好的法子呢？去搶吧？去剥猪玀吧？太危險了！犯法的，去偷吧？也不行。自殺吧？太不値得！浸有這勇氣，然而……。</p>
<p>深秋的風，一陣銳厲似一陣地刮得呼呼價響，吹到身上感到冷颼颼地，好像風中的寒氣都打從皮膚的汗毛窠内直鑽到心骨。</p>
<p>馬路兩旁的洋梧桐，也跟着風聲蕭蕭地飄下了幾片黄葉，啊！冬來了！同時，這個世界裏的潛伏着的二種不同階級，又要重現在我人的眼前，漸漸地，漸漸地，展開，擴大，深刻化了！</p>
<h3>寒衣</h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>西風一陣陣的吹緊，大地也漸漸兒有了寒意，不錯，過了風雨的重陽，天氣更比以前冷得多了。</p>
<p>薄薄的夾衣，當然不能再抵禦寒氣，所以棉衣絨繩衫，都應時而起了。當然有錢的人，没有什麽憂愁，祗要忙了幾個成衣匠，日夜的趕做，供給一班小姐太太們，一試新衣，一九三三年的寒衣，當然又有一種新式樣了。</p>
<p>有幾個摩豋密司，手中拿了絨繩的活計，無論在什麽地方，不住的工作着伊們也在那裏很敏捷的趕作寒衣。</p>
<p>但是我們想到黄河决口之處，和共匪的區域裏，吃也常常發生問題，那裏顧得到呢？所以那些地方，一天冷一天，他們的心，也一天碎一天，西風吹緊，寒衣無着，多麽的可憐呀！</p>
<p>都市的少奶小姐們，一年更換一次寒衣，好像去年的寒衣，不能再着的了。祗好送給奶媽丫環去穿。所以許多的寒衣，祗穿了一冬。</p>
<p>我聽說在陜西甘肅的地方，不要說是寒衣，據說他們的袴子，也不能個個人有得穿，和都市的少奶小姐們相比，眞是，「雲泥之判了。」</p>
<p>無産階級的人，一見西風吹了，多少使他們有些悲感，因爲西風起後，寒衣又要想法去添製，或者是到長生庫中贖出來了。</p>
<h3>丹楓</h3>
<p>— 謝基爵</p>
<p>「丹楓不是尋常色，半是啼痕半血痕」，這是一種　　多麽悲壯的句調呵！</p>
<p>秋深了！棲霞山的楓林，靈谷寺的紅葉，往昔我也曾欣賞過，總覺得是一些秋的點綴而已；心情間何嘗感到有一個偉大的象徴，一年一年的，老是平淡的看過了。而今，兩處的楓葉仍是異樣的紅，只是紅的色素中似已帶了些慘黯的成分，驕陽射在葉面上越發的反映出一種可怕的顔色，若把每一張楓葉比之現時的中國，正如那驕陽所逼出的狀態一般堪傷。</p>
<p>「丹楓不是尋常色，半是啼痕半血痕」，整個的中國也已不是尋常的景色，正是「半是啼痕半血痕」呵！</p>
<h3>西風起後</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>一陣陣的西風，從街上飛起了一陣陣的灰沙，在街上，行人的肩部不由得高聳了起來。我從愛文義路上跑出來街上舖滿了一層的梧桐葉，有的呈了黄色，有的呈了紅色，一片片的小葉打在頭上，我從一片片落葉中竄出來走到了西北風中去。</p>
<p>許多十足摩豋的女人，都穿起了皮領的大衣，在馬路上鍍着步，好像没有看見梧桐葉落下來了，没有知道西北風已吹到了面前一般。我身上祇穿了一件薄極的夾衣，在路上受了面風的攻擊，已失去了抵抗冷度的效能，不覺有些抖了。</p>
<p>不一刻走到了新閘路，我受不住了，預備搭電車回去穿一件衣服，走了不多幾步到了電車站，我站立在那裡等候街上的電車，可是電車好像被冷的風吹緩了速度似的，好久没有來，我站着。</p>
<p>在那邊圍牆的一角，有一個當舖子，一個鐵如意的鐵柄下面，高掛着「當」字的原牌，我不由的從想乘電車的念頭轉念到那邊的當舖子，我的思想完全被這「當字」的照牌籠罩了我一切的一切了。</p>
<p>從這邊望去，有二個好像祇穿了一件單衣的人從當舖的大門口跑了進去，進了門，有當字的大屛風，遮住了一切内部的秘密，不知道裏面是怎麽一回事。從這邊望去，祇看見門口的小招牌在風中飄蕩着。</p>
<p>不久有一個穿了破長衫的從屛風後面轉了出來，向四面望了一望，手另拿着一包藍布包着的東西，好像做了賊怕人看見一般。我從這裏望過去，正同他打了一個照面，呀，那不是我們隔壁的王先生嗎，他搬了家之後没有見過他，怎弄到如此了呢？</p>
<p>我正在懷疑，突然不見了王先生的蹤跡。王先生，他的兒子在閘北設立了一家商號，他所有的産業就是這家商號。但是在前次被大砲轟了個乾凈，他的兒子空身回來，失了業，在半年前，他們因爲漸漸窘急下來搬了家，以後就不知去向。</p>
<p>電車來了，我忘記了身上的冷，我又不想回去穿衣，那邊走過來一個穿皮大衣的姑娘帶來了一陣西風。</p>
<h3>錫遊草丨丨丨丨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>波平　渚對烟　，大小箕山鎭日閒，三兩漁舟逐水去，斜陽影裏鳥雙還如此湖山不厭看，得寛閒處且憑闌，滄桑人事休相問，康海茫茫付樂觀。</p>
<h3>太湖閒眺</h3>
<p>湖闊挾龍趨，峯多山不孤，濤聲和雨壯，水勢爲風驅，地域分吳越，嵐光在有無，西湖何足儗，雄秀總殊途。（聲白謂太湖妙處在雄壯闊大西湖秀麗似不可同日語也）</p>
<h3>醉了的紅葉</h3>
<p>— 徐本熙</p>
<p>踏着秋光，我又到了蘇州。蘇州本是我舊游之地，寒山寺的鐘聲已經懶得去聽，縱讓郁達夫先生把「一帆風雨過婁門」的情趣，看得如何高雅；而細雨騎驢，沿着七里山塘緩緩去奠拜眞孃的那種逸致，又是如何足以回憶，可爲了我此行的目的是去看天平山紅葉，對於姑蘇臺畔的低徊，也就見得平凡了。</p>
<p>眞的，乘着秋色垂暮，濃霜披上了楓葉肩頭的時光，豋天平山去看滿山紅樹，誰也會盤桓不忍去的，這因爲丹楓有着像紅妝美人般的姣艶；而晚霞反照紅葉，在蕭瑟秋風裏動搖的那種姿態，又象徴着戰士精神的緣故，智慧的人們，誰不要贊嘆在充滿枯澀秋意的人生裏，會有活躍的殷紅來點綴呢！古人詩：「停車坐愛楓林晚，霜葉紅於二月花」，要不是熱情的人，誰說得出這樣動人的話？不曾實實際看過成林紅葉的人，更有誰知道詩意的偉大和眞切！</p>
<p>我們走到「一線天」的時候，已經是日斜午後了，午後的陽光，顯得没午前那麽有精神，但正因陽光的黯澹，在一叢叢紅葉上反映出來的色彩是更鮮艶。「萬笏朝天」原只有空虛和寂寞，凌亂的怪石在白露凝霜的秋天，愈感到衰敗和没落，但爲了山崖紅樹的陪襯，反覺得像一個頽唐的老人復活了春意似的，在吐露無限的幽思，而四圍環抱的丹楓，好像沈醉了的美人，浮上了青春的紅暈在向大自然獻媚，這一幅包含二種情意和活力的圖畫，已經代表了人生最得意和最悲哀的二個階段，憑是不善感傷的人，對此也不免啟人生憂戚之思了。</p>
<p>秋天的山林，本來是充滿死灰的，颯颯的西風和着蕭蕭的落葉，付麽也在催人老去，可是在天平山，有着血花似的紅葉，來點綴幻滅的季候，使人從日就衰頽的心境中，重復放出奮鬥的光芒，這挑撥和啟示的力量是多麽雄壯呢！虹葉之爲紅葉，難道單給詩人來歌詠就算了嗎？我們於欣賞紅葉之餘，至少要抓示紅葉所給予我們的暗示而進前，</p>
<p>回到山下的時候，看見一個外國女郎坐在草地上作畫，伊穿着淡藍色的便服，映上白晢的頸和手，一望就知是個很愛美的人，伊一面縱目眺望山林，一面在凝思描畫，看伊的稿上，已經鈎了個山的輪廓；而對於滿山紅葉，均匀地配上相當的部位，看伊對於紅葉的欣賞，至少可斷定伊也是紅葉的愛好者了。</p>
<p>帶回來的幾片紅葉，夾在書裏有些枯萎了：我悼惜它壽運的不長，呆想了半天。</p>
<p>遊線所至</p>
<h3>玄武湖的殘秋</h3>
<p>— 偉中</p>
<p>星期日了，又得照例到外面溜溜，天氣陰沈沈，又不下雨，躱在屋子裏，更會得無聊，老朱和葛發起游玄武湖，跟他們在新街口上了一部雙輪馬車，這是寛闊的石子路上，冷清清地少見游人！秋深了吧？馬蹄得得，在寥廓的空間，響着沈着的步伐行進，</p>
<p>出了城，就是一道長堤，我們下車來，沿着靠湖的一面走去。</p>
<p>這裏，不正是爲一般人憧憬着所謂古蹟名勝之地麽？是的。晋元帝在這裏操演過他的水師：宋元嘉時，在這裏見過一條玄龍：自來也有不少的騷人墨士，在這裏留連過；可是而今呢？卽使你要找一點遺風餘韻，也幾乎是不可能了！</p>
<p>抄過亞洲，抺箇灣，就到了美洲。革命的建設功績，是多麽驚人喲！玄武湖已不復呌玄武湖了！據說「建設」把這裏劃成亞，美，歐，非，澳五個洲，呌它做「五洲公園」·丨現在，玄武湖又成了歷史上的名字。</p>
<p>美洲，是這裡最傑出的一處，具有最現代的結構，歐美式的房屋，轟立象牙塔似的紀念碑，平坦的人行道，圖案的園地，到處是花，到處是草。丨可惜此刻已不是那萬紫千紅，爭妍鬭芳的時候哪！</p>
<p>中山堂挹雲樓等處，也換了個樣子，天寒了，人們不再需要這種清凉的地方；剩下幾個茶博士們，在圍着一張方桌子，鬧那車馬砲的玩意。</p>
<p>風丨獵獵地把水面刮起一疊疊魚鱗，映着淡淡的日光，湖邊有幾處斷梗殘枝，不聲不響的倒在水面。</p>
<p>「咦！」老葛在那邊竹林裏怪呌起來，趕將過去。原來他正發見了一種「竹竿文學」，在津津有味的讀着。這裏差不多每根每根的竹竿上，都刻着蠅頭大小的字·從風呀，月呀，「妹妹我愛你」之類的兒女私情起，至某年某月某某到此一游的紀念文章，而至（抗日救國」，「誓死收復失地」之國家大事止，幾幾全盤給這裏幾根竹竿網羅盡了。然而寫「抗日救國」這類文字的，却占不上十分之一，想來國已太平，日也無容抗得！抑是在這刻竹的朋友們，又是另一個國家的呢？</p>
<p>走過去就到了非洲。非洲比不得美洲，没有現代式的建築物，没有整片的花圃整片的草地，和寛廣而平坦的人行道；美洲已披上了二十世紀資本主義的外罩，這裏却還十足的保存着十五六世紀的農業社會的雛形。</p>
<p>水邊一簇簇蓬蒿蓼草，零亂地散著，雜着幾竿白了頭的蘆葭；岸上秃頭的桑幹，稀落落的疏竹，掩蔽着一家兩家的茅舍。田塍上散亂着雞散亂着犬，狺狺地吠着。在這蔓草縱橫的小徑上踱着，倒也别有一種樸質自然和偉大神秘的力量襲上心頭。</p>
<p>再過去，就有一條很長的堤直通到歐洲，一片萎黄的蓬蔓，在西風裏戰抖着：幾個牧童樵子，正彎着腰，駝着肯，在四面都環著水的澳洲上蠕蠕爬動。有幾堆斷垣敗瓦，寂寂地倒在附近。</p>
<p>這一切的景象，太凄凉了，我們的詩人丨老朱，拾起一片落葉，寫着「一顆凄凉的秋心」，隨手撩下水去，徐徐地微微地躺到水面，流着流着，一枝倒敗的荷梗把它攔住了。</p>
<p>凄凉嚙着詩人的心，再不能讓老朱在此地逗留下去了！他趕着催我們回去，在來的那條長堤上，找着原來的那輛馬車，跨上去，得得的蹄聲又在空寂寥廓的秋空，撒開了深秋的凄凉的情調。</p>

<h3>洋拆異常窒滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋拆始終勿渝、早午兩市依舊做開七分、劃頭無加水、亦一律白劃、拆票交易、早市轉帳四百十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、洋押欵交易九十餘萬、鈔票收回七十餘萬、發出八十餘萬、客路來去胃二十五萬、銀行收解、緣是日値星期六、故形勢格外清淡、外商銀行收解票欵銀九十餘萬、洋一百六七十萬、各種貨滙押墊什欵收解銀二百萬左右、洋二百九十餘萬、特欵收解銀一百四十餘萬、出倉銀二十萬、洋三十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百四五十萬、各種貨滙稅雜諸欵收解二百七八十萬、特欵收解一百九十餘萬、進倉三十萬、日商銀行進倉銀二十萬、洋四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千三百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百五十餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、收現二三十萬、又本市票據交換所十八日交換總數、銀元六百零六萬六千六百七十五元六角二分、内計銀元二百二十九萬五千二百二十二元四角、滙劃銀元三百七十七萬一千四百五十三元二角二分、</p>
<h3>江角突漲四元</h3>
<p>昨日江南小洋、早市特殊加昂、計爲八百三十三元三角、午市回小八角、爲八百三十二元五角、結果較昂四元之巨、做出交易、早市四千五百角、午市六千角、廣東小洋、早市爲七百八十五元八角、午市爲七百八十六元、結果亦漲一元一角、交易早市七萬五千角、午市五萬五千角、銅元改縮一千五百文爲三百零四千、交易三萬六千四百八十串、計代價洋一萬二千元、</p>
<h3>證劵一九關獨漲一元二角　餘回好四五角至八九角　政謠仍盛過程極端險惡</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、因報載閩局緩和、人心興奮、趨勢似有轉機、因散戶大部份已由多翻空、但市上謠言、尙未全息、杯弓蛇影時與多頭以打擊、市價波動、依然鉅大、漲風尙無繼續能力、足見空頭心思、仍甚濃厚、按閩事醞釀已久、迄未有辦法宣布、足見内部複雜、未能一致、且視當局之運用手腕如何耳、昨上午開盤、人氣非常興奮、各帮補空狂猛、四號幷有買進、二十一號買進亦不少、但係代客性質、散戶亦追隨其後、各債市似有飛黄騰達之象、大都均好起一元左右、二十關漲一元三四角、後列各種、雖隔日前跌後漲頗有參差、而漲勢幷不稍滅、可見空頭之慌張、次盤形勢、當有繼續趨高之勢、不料大戶忽有賣出、三號·五號·五十四號·二十一號亦有抛出、市價竟不克維持、四號雖欲拉提、亦不可得、故反轉跌二三角至四五角、中間祗一九關徴好二角、上午兩盤、市畢已在下午二時、故午後開盤、延至四時有半、臨時又改作一盤、趨勢依然見小、晚報消息、雖屬混沌、而謠言仍盛二十一及五十四號賣出極力勇猛、賴有四十二及四十六號兩家大爲吸收、否則又有鉅大跌風、各債前列好一二角、後列小二三角、金短小八角之多、市價結果、尙漲起四五角至八九角、一九關因四號需要最殷、獨漲一元二角、趨勢尙屬混沌、因買賣雙方、勢均力敵、未知鹿死誰手也、成交總數、計共二千七百十一萬六千元、内現貨一千元、期貨統鹽稅共一千零四十一萬五千、裁兵佔四百十七萬、一九關着共三百七十一萬五千、二十捲二十圖共四百八十二萬、餘則數萬至數十萬不等、</p>
<h3>紐約股市堅後重疲</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、十七日紐約股市、先以美金疲軟堅挺、後因美金回高轉疲、金礦股多頭了結、猛跌數元、美金盤旋終日、上落無定、投機家目光多由股市轉向匯兌、美金之挺秀、全由於未能證實之謠言、謂美政府或將限止資金出口、此種報告、宣傳旣久、似乎實有其事、惟據專家觀察、十分之九多係心理作用、又據可靠方面意見、謂政府或將安定美金於日前之水平線、以期灌輸信任心云、全日股票成交二百三十二萬股、「小麥」交易清淡、受滙兌影響跌二分、需要建設的消息、以恢復信任心、「棉花」受匯兌影響、限制損失交易、及承認蘇俄問題、跌二十磅音、南方農民向政府借欵之接受、逐漸減少、套賣因見增多、紗布清淡、現貨需要不暢、金融善後社收買黄金每兩價格爲三三·五六元不動、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>
<p>收價　較前日</p>

<h3>紗花　冷寂的紗花市</h3>
<p>紗市仍無榮辱可分、市勢極其渙散、以被某會穩定紗市之後、一般投機者皆束手不動、因此交易日見减少、市塲上顯現一片凄凉散漫之象、就大勢論之、四圍環境惡劣、凡百物價皆在衰敗中、所以上漲之力、較爲缺乏、</p>
<h3>人標靜定</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、交易頗清、拍開空盤甚多、營業時間祇二十五分鐘、可見交易之冷淡矣、各月跌一·二·角、午後聞川帮稍有五百包、市况又振、各月回漲一·二·角、全日成交統計八千三百五十包、查賣出裕康五百包、椿記九百五十包、恒昌三百五十包、新華四百包、買進義成二百五十包、大豐五百五十包、義餘二百包、德記二百包、愼記二百包、同和二百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市晨疲午堅、美棉趨跌、而匯兌又縮、金價回漲、比價無上落、故人心平靜、本月份又有軋空之風說、然事實上極其平弱、以銀根仍緊、而現棉售價較廉、就此情形而論、所以欲軋空上漲、深恐亦難大升、</p>
<h3>鄭標漲跌兩難</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、以場上買戶不多、人氣散淡、各月跌五分至一角、午後聞現棉生意較昨爲多、空頭抵補、各月漲五分至一角半、全日成交統計一萬九千担、查賣出昌記一千六百穗隆一千九百担、榮興八百担、長豐六百担、長餘九百担、信誠一千担、長和一千担、源興昌六百担、買進大孚一千六百担、新亨六百担、大豐八百担、賡豐六百担、仁豐一千一百担、大昶七百担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>日商在美暢購現棉　丨國内棉廠需求較澹丨</h3>
<p>紐約十一月十七日電告一週棉市狀况云、南方未有賣出之壓力、而美元復形疲弱、致稍稍引起需求、同時美元前途之不定、及較高物價在消費者需求方面之影響、已限制投機買進、而發生頗形擾攘的波動、近期棉價漲至每磅一角以上、南方優級棉花、乃稍稍賣出、但價格之基礎、甚爲堅强也、聞日商在西南暢購現棉、棉商亦有不少需求、但國内棉廠需求較少、原棉價漲後、棉貨需求轉佳、但購者大部份旣猶觀望不前、以隨時提取的期棉抵借每磅四分之說、現未有切實發展、據官場消息、對於期棉不擬有何行動、以其可擾亂市面也、</p>

<h3>糧食洋麥將征稅期粉麥大漲特漲　丨粉漲四分餘…麥高一角外丨</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市、本因連日激漲之後、北帮嫌大、不似從前之爭先辦裝、客化旣緩、亦有轉入平坦之象、乃因昨日報載洋麥徴稅之舉、已經議决、此舉勢在必行、週至明年一二月内必定徴收、故正式命令不日可下也、因此消息、市乃急轉直上、雖洋麥報小三四五六角與客化特淡、而粉市反見步步上升、午後遠期尤俏、洋麥報價雖小、但無定貨、惟福新廠又成交政府美麥船價四元二角半、進後亦未套出、故收市價二是漲四分半、三月大四分二五、四月大四分七五、一月大三分二五、本月大一分二五、二月大一分七五云、</p>
<p>麥昨日麥市、開市後卽因報載洋麥徴收進口稅、以百分合算麥收五角、粉收三角七分半、今日洋麥定貨難劃、成本加高、國内不足應用、故人心甚爲向上、各月份一致上升、遠期因收稅問題、午後更見飛騰、收市四月大一角四分之多、三月大一角二分、二月大一角一分、近期亦爲跟好、本月一月各大二分、十二月大四分、現麥續漲、中關又漲五分、特高未開、開出瑤灣麥四元一角、秦潼明光塘市均四元零四五分、常熟四元、由福新去四千二百包、阜豐去五百包云云、</p>
<h3>河下米市定中帶軟</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源仍湧、共到船頭七十餘號、裝貨共八九千石、其中晚稻尙占四十號左右、計有五六千石、且幸客帮包胃亦復暢辦五千餘包、數合六七千石、市况已見轉定、惟以今日星期未免有所影響、因之後市稍軟、總觀景象、是爲定中帶軟之局、常帮蘇同帮南港等粳及杜羊尖、本街納胃初市頗佳、但後倐忽轉呆、遂成到銷兩豐、市况亦惟平平而已、除變元仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源四十八九艘、市上各種消胃勒價略化、市形新粳羊尖價小角外、早稻·薄稻·陰元價形定勢、杜埠客尖平疲、白元小數分、</p>
<h3>客秈稍淡回平　▲洋米徴稅議决人心看好▲</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、客化又淡、到頭則因連日報漲、又有車輪裝到、途路亦可不日抵埠、供過於求、市又回平、惟洋米已决議微收特稅、市上存有洋米二十二萬餘包、不肯輕易脫手、昨雖客秈銷胃呆化、而洋米因徴稅反爲喊高近角、故洋米未有成交、客秈雖銷淡而價亦站住不落、全日由福州辦去湖南機紅米四十四包、價七元四角、泉州辦去湖南機靖四百十包、價七元三角半、江西機晚四百九十七包、價七元八角三分至七元七角、本街辦去無錫機元米一百包、價八元半、行情均與前日相似、</p>
<h3>生仁跌後已見回頭</h3>
<p>生仁一再慘跌、直至跌近六元時、引起不少辦胃、如小呂宋·廣帮·汕頭及油廠等均起採購、故其存底早已售通、（陳貨約有百餘噸）市價亦已比賤時漲起半元有奇、來源因産地價高、致車輪兩稀、廣帮爲自運貨居多、所以近來市形、頗居堅穩、但市場中盛傳不日將有大批運到、昨徐州貨開出四十噸、價售六元四角平、郯城貨十餘包、價六元八角二、均由油廠黨去、花生去路、有汕頭·寗波·内地等搜辦、故市勢頗屬俏俐、昨市總成交約有一千五百餘包云、</p>
<p>絲茶　日絲慘跌絲銷益滯</p>
<h3>秋乾繭無人問訉</h3>
<p>白廠經歐美銷路一落千丈、絲價慘跌、滬埠各絲廠存絲充厚、資金呆滯、無法支持、紛紛减工停機、製絲原料、需要毫無、乾繭市益形萎靡、一般餘繭客手中存繭、竟至無人問訉、昨公會上秋乾繭五百二十斤、繅折價祗開一百零三元、凈繭本每絲一百斤祗扯六百元强、仍屬有行無市、蓋因現下海外來價Ｂ級白廠經美祗五百餘元、英法六百二三元、若再外加繅工等一百五六十元、則廠方每包須虧本二百餘元、繭市益無生氣矣、</p>
<h3>輯里經續有運滬</h3>
<p>下身輯里乾經、印銷尙不寂寞、故來源不弱、昨内河小輪又由潯震兩埠裝到白乾經五十八件、均下身等級、</p>
<h3>優等人造絲運日</h3>
<p>日輪上海丸昨晨出口、計有優等八寳圖皇后等牌人造絲五十噸、運往日本、聞係大阪某綢廠所購、天佑洋行出品、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷轉機難</h3>
<p>美財長去職、通貨膨脹可望實現、無如國際消息惡劣、經濟不安、紐約生絲市價回漲甚微、蓋因橫濱日絲慘跌不已、絲銷仍無轉機之望、滬埠絲市呆滯如故、昨祗信孚等進川黄廠經十五包、黄粗絲八包、白乾經七包、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶略有走銷</h3>

<h3>新臉譜</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>說是受着潮流的影響，文舞臺的戲兒一齣齣換了。脚色雖然依舊，而臉譜却是簇新的。</p>
<p>從前飾員外飾紳士的，如今是要畫上愁苦的臉譜，扭着鼻子呌窮了；從前做潑旦，做三角戲裏淫婦的，如今也就戴了正經的面孔，反串起正生來了：白臉的回到後臺去塗上更白的粉，不久重又上塲：青面獠牙的裝出不自然的笑容，向着看客們做媚眼。這些這些，全是新的，簇新的。</p>
<p>舊戲雖也還有，然而是新裝了。薛平貴西凉招親，駱宏勳揚州打擂臺，從前是武生戲，如今却由半陰性的小生串演了。但也還會使刀，使槍，放暗箭，怪聲怪氣地喝，妞妞妮妮的挑戰。</p>
<p>於是看客們就喝采。</p>
<p>臉譜是愈出愈奇了。紅的，白的，黑的，塗金的：互相競賽，拉拉扯扯的鏖戰，敗了，去重畫一個再來。最後的是洋臉譜，高鼻子，碧眼兒，走起路來直着腿，嘴裏哼着洋四書，洋禮記。不信，請吃外國火眼。再不信，飛機，坦克，來福槍。</p>
<p>於是，看客們又喝采。</p>
<p>但臉譜是還有其他妙用的。前回蕭到上海來，上海的文人們就送他一套新發明的臉譜小模型，而且還收在盒子裏。蕭就很高興的帶着走了。可見臉譜還可以饋贈名人，請名人帶到外國去播種，以埀永久的。</p>
<p>這自然只限於國貨，而且要「新發明」。</p>
<h3>諾貝爾文藝奬與亡國者</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>昨天，同一位雜誌的編者談起諾貝爾文藝奬金，接着作了一點戲談，說：</p>
<p>丨丨你們貴刊出不出「滿洲文學專號」？</p>
<p>丨丨那麽，你就是最大的作家了。其次，還有李輝英，他笑着說。</p>
<p>丨丨還有一位就是楊晦。我們算是「滿洲」三大「文豪」了。說着我笑了笑。</p>
<p>這是一段笑譚。可是他引起我無限的感傷和好多的疑問來。</p>
<p>據說，這一次的諾貝爾奬金獲得者蒲寗，是一位「流亡者」，現在住在巴黎。我覺得我的境遇同他的點相同。雖然，我不敢把「流亡者」這個榮銜釘在腦袋上，可是，從「九一八」以來，我總算是一個「亡國者」罷。而且，蒲寗住在西方的巴黎，我住的則是東方的巴黎。這次，蒲寗得奬，我覺得自己也似乎沾到一點光。諾貝爾奬金委員會總算看得起「亡國者」。</p>
<p>印度的泰戈爾老人得過了一次奬。他也是一位「亡國者」，因爲他住在印度，所以，我們也没有意識到他具有「亡國」的悲哀的。所以我們也看不出諾貝爾奬金的委員會是如何地高看了他。可是，這一次，把奬金頒給蒲寗，確是委員老爺們「另眼看待」了。</p>
<p>我想將來如果委員老爺凖照着這種「體恤」「亡國者」的原則繼續下去，那麽，「亡國者」也會有一條出路。不但受封，又可以發財，名利雙收，豈不是兩全其美。美國的黑人作家，非洲的黑人作家得過，將來就是最后，輪到「滿洲」的話，無論封的是我們「三大文豪」的那個罷，我總可發一筆洋財，雖不加官，也可進祿。那時，至少，我可以多吃一點牛肉。因爲都是好朋友，無論是楊晦受封，或是李輝英領奬，我是總可以揩一點油水的罷。</p>
<p>然而蒲寗像並不是一位了不起的作家似的。庫蒲林Ｋuprin人所共知的庫蒲林，像並未受過封。如果問世界有没有尙未受封的大作家。在法國不是有着紀德ＡndreＧide麽？在俄國還有高爾基。可是，不給紀德，又不給高爾基，而偏偏地給了蒲寗，這足證明奬金委員會，是不以作品，而是以身分取士了。那麽，「滿洲」「三大文豪」不是更有希望了麽？</p>
<p>奇怪的是自從泰戈爾受封之后，其他的亡了國而未曾作「流亡者」的作家並没有得過奬。去年諾貝爾奬金給的是美國的路易士ＳinclairＬewis黑奴作家休士Ｈughe等没有一個受過奬。這是怎麽回事呢？若不是以作品的價値分，就是對「亡國者」的待遇，是不等的。</p>
<p>可是，爲什麽對於「亡國者」的待遇會不同呢？「亡國」，在什麽地方，都是「亡國。」大槪是因爲「亡國」的方式不同，「亡國」的性質各異。那麽，「滿洲的三大文豪，」也可以不要希冀了。</p>
<p>像我們這樣的「亡國者，」恐怕不是諾貝爾奬金委員會所能同情的。</p>
<h3>歇客店</h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>日頭快落山了。王二憂鬱的沉思的坐在門檻上劈火石取火吸烟。</p>
<p>一所破舊，黑暗而潮濕的小屋，是剛經用石灰水粉刷的。「安寓客商」四個歪斜的黑字就寫在門頂粉白的牆上。屋内：板壁和柱子也粉刷了石灰水，盡力想把這小屋的破舊齷齪的缺點除去。王二爲要振興營業，修理了這破屋。他借了筆錢，從舊衣莊添辦了半新的棉絮，半新的被單，請木匠修理了那些蹩脚的，或是幾乎解體的床架。因爲他要把十二個銅子一夜的歇錢，增加爲二十個銅子。但是，從那時起，漸漸的很少有歇客走進他的門檻了。就是幾個長住的顧客，也換了别家歇店去了。</p>
<p>每當太陽落山的時候，他憂鬱的沉思的坐在門檻上。面前是一條通到五十里路外一個城市中去的官路。一些人從城裏買辦了貨物，挑了籬担，挑了滿滿的布袋過去……有的給肩上的童担，把背弄曲了，像牛一般的吐氣；有的走蹩了脚。各個人都要休息，但，他們全没有停下他們前進的脚步。</p>
<p>「夜了，這里住吧！」</p>
<p>王二坐在門檻上對每個走過去的人露着笑臉。</p>
<p>「天没有斷黑，還能看出路影啦！」</p>
<p>這末回答，認識他的人，交還他一個苦笑，過去了。</p>
<p>如果王二看見挑重担的，面上顯示着懊喪的人，又換了口吻，十分同情的同他們說：</p>
<p>「啊，朋友，你挑了這末重的担……這末重……恐怕有二百斤……别拚老命，歇下來，坐坐……一有的吐口氣，便歇下來了。劈頭第一句，他們便說：</p>
<p>「城里又拉夫……要二千名……成千成萬的兵……」</p>
<p>說話的人，這末扳起面孔一說，就有許多人趕來聽講。</p>
<p>「聽說穿長衫的人不拉，這世界穿長衫的人便宜了……鄕下人聽到風聲不敢進城，半路逃回去了，城里市面，也没有生意，鄕下人不進城，城里人吃什麽啦！這年頭城里人也倒霉了……」</p>
<p>談話一拉長，他們互相詢問着，談着：造反，打仗，兵和匪開火，大荒年，人吃人……</p>
<p>過路客人，立起看看天色，暮上色蒼茫，夜從相　　　　　　，</p>
<p>再會，　　「老闆！」</p>
<p>「這里宿啦！我這兒有新　　，新草蓆……天黑了，這里住……」</p>
<p>但是，王二没有把客人留住，「新棉被」和「新草蓆」不能引誘他們了。</p>
<p>晚上，這所曾經振興過一番的歇客店没有一個旅客下宿。</p>
<p>王二對他的老婆說：</p>
<p>「這年頭，做小生意的也絕少來去；牛販，茶葉客，算命瞎子也少了；走江湖賣假藥的，要　法的，換鷄毛糖的，他們全住廟宇，祠堂，不住歇客店了……」</p>
<p>「那末你爲什麽，要借債修理房子，添辦棉被……」</p>
<p>老婆帶着責問的口吻。王二，無話回答，祗轉過頭深深地歎了口氣。</p>
<h3>關於「花鼓戲」</h3>
<p>— 葉德均</p>
<p>如何先生三篇論「花鼓戲之起源」，徴引羣書謂花鼓起源於宋代的「訝鼓戲」和「打夜胡」，因爲三種的音相近事也相類，所以是一事三名。</p>
<p>除孟元老東京夢華錄，雲麓漫抄所記打夜胡的習俗，吳自牧夢梁錄也有同樣的記載，末了說：「亦驅儺之意也」。這分明是驅逐疫鬼的歲終大儺的儀式，後來乞丐在此時扮演鍾馗驅鬼故事來斂錢。黄石歲終大儺考引福州志書謂：「歲除，鄕人儺。古有之，今州人以爲打夜狐。…」福州習俗正是沿襲宋人遺風。我們固然可以認爲打夜胡是種娛樂的事，然而她是大儺的舊習，而打花鼓一方是流浪江湖賣藝的鳳陽人的謀生之計，另一方面觀者也當着純娛樂的事。不論打夜胡有無歌詞，她和花鼓的歌詞決不相同，卽使有也祗是關於驅鬼的事，而花鼓曲則如佟賦敏所謂「大抵嫌褻之詞」。花鼓的　角　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　有　　　，從這幾辦看來　打夜湖和打花鼓並非一事，兩者相似的是同爲貧者謀生之計而已。旣然是事不相類，音相近就更不可靠了。起源於訝鼓的話法，作者已說「未易考定」，如說訝鼓始於王子醇的話，又和野生藝術的花鼓戲不相　，兩者也不是一事了，總之，花鼓戲先於雜劇傳奇之說是可疑的。我感覺她的起源和皮簧時期相近，如果她早已存在也會和皮簧一樣成爲正宗了，而她現在在民間傳播的勢力雖然很大，但仍然是幼稚的，正是野生藝術没有蛻化成正宗的形態。</p>
<p>我覺得她的起源是先有打花鼓的歌詞，如「描金花鼓兩頭圓，……」是打花鼓所唱的；後來纔有花鼓戲，而她所表演的就是關於打花鼓的事，如京劇的打花鼓，湖南的王三賣内之類　故鄕每逢迎神賽會，正會之前必有「花鼓會一兩班。每班七八人至十數人，所扮演的也不外通常故事，但却没有打花鼓。每人脚不綁着五六尺長木棍，表演時祗是前後走走，是没有歌詞的啞劇。至於用七八尺長木棍的，又不呌花鼓會」，而呌做「高蹺」。從牠的定名看，和打花鼓多少總有些因緣的。這又是牠的一個變象。</p>
<p>何如按：打夜胡，亦驅儺之意也，吳自牧的話不錯，可是他不曾說此卽古之所謂儺也，因爲它和儺還是有别的。但若認儺爲打夜胡的或一先代，固無不可，猶之我認打夜胡爲花鼓之或一先代亦通也。其實，我說花鼓戲與打夜胡打訝鼓之關係，尙自其近者言之，若溯其遠源，固非論及巫舞大儺不止也。雖然，一藝術之成立，取精用宏，錯綜複雜，若執一以求，有通識之史家殆不如是，吾所謂源於某者，蓋辜較之辭亦蓋然之辭，以備假想之一說耳。葉先生以鄙見爲何如？</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十三）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>不錯，陸醉米太太的聰明雖然有限，但她却有着觸覺，嗅覺和女人們的纎細的官能，可是她並不曾疑到這事，她曾很大方的舉杯爲瑪賴沙在天之靈祝福。倘使她有一點疑心的話，她决不會這　幹的。現在他不再懷疑了，對於落在他弟弟身上的那舉財富的無意識的不滿，和對於母親的敬愛之忱，無疑的激發了他這番謹愼，孝友的可敬的但却不免誇張的謹愼。</p>
<p>他構成這個結論時，像做了一宗好的行爲一樣感着滿足，他决定要對大家和氣，第一是對於他的父親，因爲他父親那種糊塗的論斷，庸俗的意見，和過於觸目的平凡處所，常是使得他生氣。</p>
<p>吃午飯的時候，他没有遲到，並且憑着他的機智和愉快的心境，他引得一家人都快樂起來他的母親高興極了，對他說道：</p>
<p>「我的筆兒，你不知道當你高興的時候，你是怎樣的頑皮而又有趣啊。」</p>
<p>他滔滔地說着，找出一些奇怪的字眼把他們的朋友形容得淋漓盡致，引得大家笑了起來。博齊汝做了他的嘲笑的目的，陸醉米太太也被他打趣了幾句，可是他說得很有分寸，謔而不虐。他一面瞧着他的弟弟，一面心裏想道：「蠢東西，你來給她辯護吧；你闊了也没有用處，我高興時便會要把你壓下去的。」</p>
<p>喝咖啡的時候，他對他的父親說：</p>
<p>「你今天要用「珍珠」號嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我的孩子。」</p>
<p>「我可以和眞巴坐着它去頑頑嗎？」</p>
<p>「自然啦，你儘量去坐好了。」</p>
<p>他在最先到來的一家烟草店買了一根好的雪茄烟，隨後便狠樂地往碼頭走去。</p>
<p>他望着那明朗的，輝耀的，淡藍色的，被海風蕩滌過顯得凉爽的天空。</p>
<p>綽號眞巴的水手帕帕格里，在船裏面小睡着，當羅蘭早上不去釣魚時，帕帕格里便得在每天正午時候把船準備好出航。</p>
<p>「我們兩個人坐，船老大！筆爾呌說。</p>
<p>他跑下河岸上的鐵梯，跳上了小船。</p>
<p>「甚麽風？他說。</p>
<p>「老　地風，筆爾先生。今天海面的風很好。」</p>
<p>「那麽，老爹，走罷。」</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>理想與空想</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>近來時與本報業館補習學校的同學談話，聽見了很多有趣味的議論，至於這種意見的範圍則很廣，從國家的内政外交一直到個人的生活與理想均無所不包，無所不儘量的發揮。但是比較起來，大多數的人對個人的問題注意得多，而於一般的政治社會問題則殊少意見提出。推其原因，並不是現在的國家危急與社會紊亂的程度，尙不足引起他們的注意，乃是有的人覺得他們的人微言輕，多想了祗有徒增煩惱而於實際上則毫無裨益，有的人覺得政府中人尙没有辦法，我們這班見少識寡的人自然更無辦法了，還有些人對於這些問題根本就没有去想，因爲幼年鄕居而失學，到上海來過學徒的生活，除了終日碌碌的勞動外，就是得一點餘閒，有向上心的人，還要忙着做些自修的工作，那裏還有功夫去注意什麽國家大事呢？有人說，中國人對國家觀念是很薄弱的，但從上面的事實看起來，所謂國人對國事的不注意，並不是什麽天性如此，而實由於生活的環境造成。因此記者對於這班同學的勸勉與自勵的，就是我們各人在此不同的生活環境之下，對於國家觀念雖有深淺之分，勢難一致，然對於個人生活方面至少應有一種理想，做我們工作事業奮鬥的目標，否則我們的生活必陷於枯燥無味，毫無意義的境界</p>
<p>論到所謂理想是絕對與空想不同的。理想是根據現有的環境與自己的興趣能力作一種有計劃的企圖，而空想則爲許多不根據事理，極少實現可能的僥倖幻象而已。譬如一個人有成爲一化學家的理想，那麽此人平素必定是對於化學有興趣，而且要有計劃的努力於化學理論的研究與實騐的探討，如此方得謂之理想。若一人對化學旣無興趣，又無按步研究的計劃與孜孜不倦的實騐探討的精神，而欲希望爲一化學家，是則爲空想，妄想，與現在一班人以十元而希望倖得五十萬巨奬者同一的荒謬耳。</p>
<p>我們知道空想是虛幻，是僥倖，而帶有一點神秘性的，而理想則有賴於長時實際的努力奮鬥，不可以蹴一而就的願望。理想是具有奮發前進的要求，而空想則多爲頽唐失望後的一　妄念。我們深感現在社會上有空想的人實遠超過有理想的人，此足以表示這整個社會已入於頽唐失望的境界。然則我們究將如何挽救這社會的頽勢呢？此當然不是一兩句話可以回答得了的問題，但歸納起來也可以這樣說：我們不要空想妄想，要立定一種理想，不要爲這社會的黑暗而失望，我們應深切的覺悟到有理想始有光明，有理想始有人生，我們的理想即爲社會的生機。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>回農村去</h3>
<p>— 丁伯平</p>
<p>（農民）我原是在上海××工廠裏作工，因爲患了幾次病，與因母親的死虧了三百元債，每一元的利息，是每月四百文，以前還可以將工資作爲利息，後因廠内生産過剩，營業停滯的緣故，減少了工資和工作時間，因此利息付不出來，生活上也發生了危險，卽以我爲了要求資方恢復工資，廠内亦很注意我，於是就立脚不住了。</p>
<p>去年八月中秋節，債主差不多天天有人上門，逼得我好像喪家之狗，東奔西竄，没有辦法。不得已，乃於今年春末夏初之交，逃至鄕裏表姊的家中，進了那矮而且黑的空氣不流通的草屋，吃了一碗用瓦罐燒的一種有烟氣的茶。這正是農忙之際，農民們都是在那深水田中栽秧，忙得血汗淋淋，週身皆是水泥，没有片刻休息，婦女們也要在那炎日之下車水。到日落西山時，表姊的父母由田間歸來，吃飯了。我記得吃的是雞蛋湯，豆腐渣，芹菜，臭醃白菜，這在鄕間要算天字第一號待客的菜了。她的父親因爲明天要起早，吃好飯就去睡。照例，她們只要天將黑就去睡的，左右的農民們，是早已睡了。這鄕村差不多都是日食三餐，是兩餐飯一餐粥，也有吃一餐麥米飯，一餐米飯，一餐粥的。早膳時間是在七時許，午膳時間就以日在天的正中爲標凖，夜膳天夜了就吃。吃了飯除了睡覺外，就没有别的事做。</p>
<p>從這天以後，她家天天要另外爲我做些鄕間的點心，吃飯要爲我另外添點雞蛋，豆腐。這樣優待我實在使我覺得過意不去，不由的腦筋裏要發生「吃飯要勞動，不勞動者應不得食」的念頭，於是决定第二天下田帮他們作工去。剛巧那幾天秧田裏在拔草，我向隔壁借來一把草刀和一頂很大的寛圍草帽。第二日天將明的時候就醒了，將衣服換好，褲脚管捲起來，脫去了鞋襪，拿了草刀，　　草帽，同着她的父親出發。走到秧田，他們下了田，我亦照他們的方式下田去，田裏泥水的凉性沁入心脾，我低首曲腰的，許久纔走上一步。在未拔草前，每塊秧田，都先已下糞以助秧的生長。我拔草的這塊田非常大，糞下的也非常多，臭得難聞，在水内用力重些，那糞水時常的侵入嘴裏或臉上：加以秧草的磨擦，兩隻手膀被抹得通紅。天的熱氣，水的蒸氣，糞的臭氣，實在難聞難受。這樣差不多苦了有十幾天，起先本是一時的興奮，後來也不好辭而不作了。我兩手膀和背項晒脫了一層皮，黑得與紅頭阿三一樣，人也瘦了，比我在工廠裏還要費力些。天氣的熱度到了一百二十分外，秧田裏又缺水了。各處的農民們，日夜都是爲着車水忙個不息，有時我亦帮着搬水脚車，車這脚車是要非常用氣力的。車了幾天的水，天仍是老不下雨，鄕村的農民們没有一個口中不念「好菩薩，天賞飯給人吃，下點雨　！否則今年就没收成了。」他門迷信得了不得，所以村裏的長老們，大家就商量着求雨，將村廟裏的「龍神菩薩」抬出來行會。附近的農民們都携老挈幼，背着鋤，焚着香，敲着鑼，燃着砲，來祈禱「龍神菩薩」廣賜雨點，一時熱閙非常。當時我心中激起無限的悲哀。呀！天旱是預告着鄕村　恐慌將要到來呀！由城市的不景氣，被攆到鄕村的我，今後將在何處找歸宿呢？</p>

<p>名文演講</p>
<h3>潘仰堯講革命性的職業</h3>
<p>— 朱玉相記錄</p>
<p>技術性　俗話說得好，「積財千萬，不如薄藝在身」。譬如說，江北一帶的貧民，每　紙泥漿糊，竹片木屑，製成種種兒童小玩具，喊售街頭，亦能藉以糊口。又如杭州地方，有一個人，綽號呌「小猢猻」。以善製專供兒童玩弄的小猢猻而馳名全城，生涯頗不惡，歷年來並已薄有積蓄，差堪溫飽。由此可知技術與職業關係的密切，竟是分拆不開的。前年張公權先生從日本考察實業回來後，很想到本國各處工廠裏去看看：恰巧鄙人亦有此意，我們便一同前去。特别看過許多紗廠，詢以何以中國紗業，近來一蹶不振到這樣地步，廠中負責人答稱，這一部分是技術問題。據說，在日本紡一萬隻錠子的紗廠，祗消雇用二百五十名工人便行。但是在中國，就以申新而論，也須雇用三百五十名工人才幹得了，其餘規模小一點的廠家，往往須雇用四五百名工人不等，而河南鄭州有一家紗廠，竟須雇用至六百名之多。同樣的生産量，而所雇工人數目，相差這樣懸殊丨工人數目增加，工資隨之加多，於是成本亦重，那裏還可以同日貨競爭，無怪手要一敗塗地的了！日本紗廠内的工人，每人最多能管到三十七部紡車，而中國工人呢，充其量也祇能管二十幾部。目前日紗市價每件大洋二十四元，而中國紗，即申新每件也得賣大洋三十六元，並且已經很勉强了，其餘各廠家則每件非售四十元不能維持成本。你們諸位想想，要是我們不從根本上着手，積極使職業技術化，俾與外人爭一日之短長，任憑怎樣抵制日貨，還是無濟於事的。誰不想買便宜貨，誰還顧得是日貨還是國貨呢？</p>
<p>創造性　中國人喜歡吃現成飯，總不肯費一點心去創造的。兄弟在民國十六年間，與江問漁楊衛玉二先生，以及現任滬江大學校長劉湛恩博士等，發起創辦職業指導所，至今已有六年，薄具成績。每日來所請求介紹職業的青年，總在二三十起以上。統計歷來由本所介紹成功的，已有七八千人左右，也算得是對於社會上一點小小的貫獻。在日常所接觸的青年中，學業程度，參差不齊。有的剛從小學畢業，便想找事情做。有的是中學畢業生，也有的是大學畢業生，甚至在外國留學回來的都有。往往有許多青年，要求我介紹進銀行裏去辦事，好像這是他們理想中唯一的職業一般。可是，我總勸告他們，不要專吃現或飯，最好爲人所未爲。有一天，曾有一位在大學機械科畢業的青年，跑來找我介紹職業。我隨意把書桌子上的一支鋼筆桿拿起來問他，能不能製造這個，因爲目下市面上所出售的，差不多全是外國貨。他聽了很以爲然，便積極進行，籌劃到五千塊錢資本，今已開辦了一個小小的工廠在製造，將來或許是有希望的。在去年，兄弟又創辦了一個「中國徴信所」，因爲感覺到社會上確有這種需要。當時規模很小，辦事員祗有五六人，一年來進步之速，出人意料之外，因爲事務的激增，工作人員已添至四五十人，基本會員也有二十幾家，其餘洋商公司等委託徴信者，竟有七八十家之多。足見從事此種事業，比諸坐吃現成飯，厮守着舊業，有意義也有希望得多了！</p>
<p>小社会模型</p>
<h3>少小離家老大回　（女堅獄）</h3>
<p>— 李筱琴女士</p>
<p>年災月晦，本人以一個小小女店員的資格，因某種案件於民國十七年一月被捕入獄，直至民國二十二年十一月，方恢復自由。現在我就把親身所閱歷的獄中生活，分衣食衛生及作業四項，照實分述如下。但因本人是女犯，所以所叙特詳於女監方面。但我相信，男監方面的情形，祇會比女監壞，不會比女監好，因爲：第一，中國歷來習慣是如此：第二，女犯比較無人滿之患；第三，女犯不帶刑具。</p>
<p>說到監獄生活的衣的方面，犯人所能享受的，祇是終年不洗，由死人身上剥下，又穿在活人身上的破棉襖，内中的棉花是結成疙撒不開的。假如你穿在身上，有的地方就長出一個大包；有的地方，只剩下一張單皮。不能拆洗，因腐爛過甚，一拆洗便零落不成其爲衣服了。但即使是這樣汚舊的衣服，也只有幾十件，拿不到，穿不着的尙很多。至於一般慈善家所捐贈的新衣，那是囚犯穿不着的，一部份是被看守先生們用報銷了的爛囚衣頂替，把新的掉換去買錢吃大烟了。一部份是由管獄老爺們保管着，要遇着有參觀人來的時候，才給囚人穿上壯觀瞻，表治績的。假如有參觀的人來，新囚衣不夠囚徒穿着時，那没有新衣穿的囚徒，就被驅至馬桶間，避人耳目。</p>
<p>至於食的方面，因爲囚犯吃飯是論斤兩的（刑事犯每人二十二兩，政治犯每人二十四兩），我們的聰明獄官，就用爛黄米與白土石子拌和着，拿去給囚人們吃。有一次我有病，得了特别的允許，可以慢慢的吃飯（因爲普通犯人吃飯有定時，只能限幾分鐘），我即將石子揀出，所得成績，與米飯相比，是一與一之比。假如有人懷疑說：「許多石子吃下去怎様大便得出？」那我却也說不出理由，但我上面的描寫，確無一字虛僞。大槪此項石子是經過監獄專家們的研究，可以混作食糧用的吧！或者也如陜甘等省遭荒旱，人民所吃的觀音土，是一樣的性質？不過囚犯們個個都感有相當的大便不利病，或者與此也有關係。飯是如此，菜更不必說。黄爛青菜，每人每頓有這麽一快頭子，聊資點綴而已。至於其中汚穢，更是不堪聞問。天雨時，菜中可以吃出蚯蚓，報紙草屑尤爲司空見慣。飲料每日每人有三竹筒水，並無所謂茶葉，惟在夏天時有兩星期大麥煎開水喝。</p>
<p>坐監講衛生，中國人那裏有這造化！夏天洗澡，每次一百六十餘人，祗有三桶水。試問這澡怎樣洗法？看病每星期倒有兩次，但是講到吃藥那就很危險了。發痧没有痧藥水吃，便給你喝些白礬水，對於頭痛腦熱，是熬上一整鍋不知什麽中藥，給每一倒一碗喝，初不問病症的差異，醫藥應有分别。到了病重入病房時，確實就是呌你去等死。在那裏没有醫藥，也没有人看護，所以監犯再病重都深怕入病房。看守們，倘聽見某一個病囚呻吟聲高，有擾他們清聽時，只要恐嚇病囚一聲說：「再如此，送你到病房去！」假使此犯人尙未失却知覺，是不敢再出聲呻吟的。於此可知病房的威嚴了。</p>
<p>作業方面，可分爲兩部分，即：（一）包工，若給人家作絨線衣一件，外面可以爭到二三塊錢的工錢，但監獄裏祇給我們十五個銅板。作紗襪，縫襪頭，每一打給資十五個制錢，即一個半銅板。（二）長工，即進監獄特設工廠作工的，每日工作十二三小時。據說每日每囚可得一角幾分工錢，但此工錢，名爲存科，實際上囚犯除過每月照例能買物一次，開賬五百文外，其餘絲毫不能動用，也不按節給犯人算賬，使知其所存工錢有多少。那末，工錢到那裏去了呢？作長工的大多是被判處了無期或十年以上的徒刑的人，他們有的幾年病死，有的永無出獄希望。即有能出獄的，這篇胡塗賬也算不清，而且誰敢算呢？只有天知這。</p>
<p>再有一件事，就是我們女人，是每月免不了一次月經的，但每次月經來時，看守們只給二十張草紙（四寸見方），試問這在一星期内將如何的用法？於是只好把爛汚布拿來一用，有的因此致毒生病，有的則被看守們發覺而遭受慘刑，說是扯毁公用衣服，罪不容赦。</p>

<h3>A Major Turning Point in Sixteen Years of Diplomatic Relations: United States Officially Recognizes Soviet Russia</h3>
<h3>White House Exchanges Documents Late at Night, Expressing Mutual Cooperation and Maintaining Peace, Guaranteeing Non-Interference in Internal Affairs, Religious Freedom for American Citizens in Russia, Debt Issues to be Resolved Later, Russia Agrees to Abandon Military Reparation Demands, Bullitt Appointed as First American Ambassador to Russia</h3>
<p>(Washington) Released this afternoon, the United States has, through the exchange of documents between the President and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, officially recognized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This exchange of documents actually took place at 11:50 PM on the 16th. From that moment on, the two countries resumed formal diplomatic relations, continuing the sixteen-year-long relationship and concluding the week-long talks between the American President and Litvinov.</p>
<p>Eight Documents Exchanged: There are eight types of documents involved in this resumption of relations between the two countries. The first is the exchange of documents between the American President and Litvinov, mutually notifying each other of their pleasure in restoring diplomatic relations, hoping that the two countries will cooperate in a normal and friendly manner for the benefit of both and to maintain world peace. The second is</p>
<p>The second exchange of documents, guaranteeing non-interference in each other's internal affairs, ensuring that the United States receives guarantees against communist propaganda. The third is</p>
<p>The third exchange of documents, mutually guaranteeing complete religious freedom for the people of the other country within its borders.</p>
<p>The fourth is a formal protocol stipulating the negotiation of a treaty to establish consulates, granting American citizens in Russia the same civil rights enjoyed by other foreigners.</p>
<p>The fifth is a mutual recognition of Litvinov's memorandum, in which Litvinov responds to the American President's oral inquiries, clearly stating the Soviet Russian procedures regarding lawsuits in economic espionage cases.</p>
<p>The sixth is an agreement in which Soviet Russia prepares to seek a final resolution to American debt claims and corresponding Soviet Russian claims, guaranteeing that it will no longer raise other demands regarding court judgments or official actions affecting the Russian government's debts.</p>
<p>The seventh is Litvinov's statement, declaring that Soviet Russia will not hold the American government responsible for property damage caused by the activities of American troops in Siberia in 1918. Finally,</p>
<p>The eighth is a joint statement signed by the American President and Litvinov, declaring that the two have exchanged views on solutions to all outstanding debt and claim issues between the two countries, hoping for a swift resolution.</p>
<p>According to the exchange of documents regarding non-interference in internal affairs by Litvinov, the tasks undertaken by Soviet Russia are far broader than generally expected. Soviet Russia has guaranteed that it will not allow its people to engage in any activities aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the United States or conspiring to forcibly change the American political or social order.</p>
<p>Regarding the third exchange of documents, the American President notified Litvinov that he expects American citizens residing in Soviet Russia to have the most complete religious freedom, including the protection of priests and other religious personnel, and that they will not be denied entry due to their religious status. Litvinov replied that Soviet Russia is prepared to grant this freedom to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>It is reported that after the exchange of documents last night between the United States and Russia to restore diplomatic relations, Litvinov went to the White House again this morning to meet with the American President for two hours. When he emerged from the White House, he told reporters that he expected the President to make a statement in the afternoon. He also answered reporters' inquiries, saying that he had no intention of going to the hot springs, so it is generally expected that the news of the restoration of diplomatic relations will be officially released this afternoon. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Joint Public Announcement: (Washington) The United States has legally recognized the Soviet government. President Roosevelt declared that representatives of the United States and Russia reached an agreement at 11:50 PM last night. The President also said that after the resumption of relations between the United States and Russia, the first American ambassador will be Assistant Secretary of State Bullitt. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov have exchanged letters on the following major issues: propaganda, freedom of religion, legal protection for citizens of both countries, investigation of economic espionage, and claims made by both sides. These letters have now been published. According to these letters, the Soviet government has abandoned its claim for damages caused by the previous deployment of American troops to Siberia. President Roosevelt and Litvinov have also jointly issued a public statement saying, "In addition to signing the agreement to restore diplomatic relations today, we have also exchanged views on other outstanding issues, such as debts and claims made by both sides, in order to find solutions and to resolve all issues that both governments wish to resolve quickly and satisfactorily as soon as possible." Litvinov will remain for a few more days to continue discussions. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>First American Ambassador to Russia: (Washington) After the news of the restoration of diplomatic relations was announced, the White House immediately announced the appointment of Assistant Secretary of State Bullitt as the first American ambassador to Russia. According to the American Constitution, the President has the power to recognize foreign countries at his discretion. Therefore, what was agreed upon between the two countries can bind the United States without waiting for congressional approval. However, the appointment of Bullitt as ambassador to Russia must be approved by the Senate. Furthermore, the final approval authority for the expenses of the embassy and consulates in Russia and the resolution of the $187 million loan to the Kerensky government also rests with Congress. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Mr. Bullitt</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Few people know the experience of Bullitt, the first American ambassador to Russia after the restoration of relations between the United States and Russia. However, Mr. Bullitt is one of the most knowledgeable people in the United States on Soviet Russian affairs and currently holds the position of Special Assistant to the American Secretary of State. When President Roosevelt negotiated with Litvinov this time, he absolutely prohibited anyone from participating in the talks. However, only Mr. Bullitt was present at all times, offering various opinions. Mr. Bullitt, when Lenin was alive, represented the United States in Russia, directly meeting with Lenin to resolve various outstanding issues. At the beginning of this US-Russia resumption of relations negotiation, it was generally believed that the current Minister to Latvia, Mr. MacMurray, would be appointed as the ambassador to Russia. However, the sudden appointment of Mr. Bullitt was unexpected. President Roosevelt's appointment of Mr. Bullitt shows how careful he is in his attitude towards Russia. (Japan Union Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, initially worked as a journalist, serving as an editor, foreign correspondent, and Washington correspondent for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. In 1917, he became an assistant in the State Department. The following year, he went to Europe as a member of the American delegation to the peace conference. In 1919, he went to Russia on a special mission. He is currently 42 years old and a graduate of Yale University. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Russian Concessions to the United States:</h3>
<h3>Abandoning Demands for Military Damages in Exchange for Tacit Guarantees of Territory</h3>
<p>(Washington) Some well-informed sources here explain that Soviet Russia's abandonment of demands for damages from the 1918 American military intervention in Siberia was a concession by the Soviets in exchange for a tacit American endorsement of maintaining Soviet Russia's existing territory. And Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov also acknowledged tonight that this issue occupied an important place in White House talks, although he would not reveal the substance of his understanding with the American president. However, at a time when Russo-Japanese border disputes are frequent, even this admission by Litvinov is of great significance.</p>
<p>Now that Soviet Russia has given up its demands for damages from the Siberian intervention, guaranteed non-interference in internal affairs, and granted complete religious freedom to American citizens, it has removed the three major obstacles to the sixteen-year severance of relations between the two countries. However, other important issues remain between the two countries, most of which are financial in nature. Therefore, it is heard that Litvinov plans to stay in Washington for a few more days to continue discussions with officials in the State Department and the Treasury Department. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Remarks to American Reporters Hint at Japanese Distrust of Russia</h3>
<h3>Sufficient to Cause Abnormal Actions</h3>
<p>(Washington) This afternoon, Litvinov met with more than a thousand representatives of various newspapers at the American Press Club, expressing his determination to make the restoration of relations between the two countries create genuine friendship. He said that there are several situations that contain distrust and resentment, which, if pushed to the extreme, can sometimes lead to extremely abnormal actions, which are currently growing and being nurtured under proper relations. It is generally believed that this statement refers to the current Russo-Japanese relations. He also said that what he and the American President and officials of the State Department have agreed upon has opened the path to a swift and satisfactory resolution of all outstanding issues between the two countries. We have opened a new page in developing genuine friendship and peaceful cooperation. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Main Topics of Negotiation</h3>
<h3>Far East Situation Promotes Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<h3>Debt Problems Can be Resolved Leisurely</h3>
<p>(Washington) The negotiations for the restoration of relations between the United States and Russia, presided over by President Roosevelt and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, have lasted for ten days. The United States has now recognized the Soviet government and restored diplomatic relations with it, ending the sixteen-year-long break in relations between the world's two great republics. Although this is extremely obvious, the circumstances of the negotiations between the representatives of the United States and Russia are extremely secret, and it is difficult to determine what the topics were. What the outcome will be is even more unknown. What can be known at this time is that the representatives of the United States and Russia have already negotiated the issues of Russian debt, communist propaganda, and the protection of American citizens. The issues of propaganda and the protection of American citizens seem to have been resolved leisurely. As for the first issue, experts will be appointed to form a committee to conduct research. In addition, the results of the negotiations on economic issues may not be as satisfactory as some Americans hope. If Russia wants to purchase large quantities of American goods, the United States must provide substantial loans, but the American government does not seem to be prepared for this. Perhaps there are more important and more secret issues in the negotiations between the United States and Russia, namely, the international political situation, especially the situation in the Far East. Regarding this, the relationship between Russia and Japan, "Manchukuo," and naval issues are of primary importance. President Roosevelt originally had a plan to negotiate the restoration of relations with Soviet Russia, but the tense situation in the Far East had reached a dangerous level, so he implemented it ahead of schedule and exchanged letters with Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov then arrived gracefully. This can be determined. It is known that the Soviet government, until now, has resolutely refused all negotiations with countries that have not recognized it. This time, Litvinov agreed to discuss all issues between the two countries at length before restoring diplomatic relations, so President Roosevelt has indeed won a victory in diplomacy.

<h3>Japan Softens Towards Russia</h3>
<h3>Studies the Use of Puppets to Come Forward</h3>
<h3>To Conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty with Russia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Masayuki Tani, Attaché of the "Manchukuo" Embassy, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning to report and discuss recent developments. After the meeting, he told reporters the following: The rumor that Japan will return the administrative rights of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Zone to "Manchukuo" is completely misreported and not true. "Manchukuo" needs peace most for economic development and domestic politics. Therefore, from this point of view, it seeks a satisfactory resolution to the China Eastern Railway issue and seriously studies concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia. Therefore, "Manchukuo" has no military preparations on the Russo-Manchu border, but the Russian side has considerable military preparations. However, I am confident that no situation will occur between Russia and Manchuria at this time. (Dentsu Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of the 19th Route Army's office in Nanjing said that on the 18th, he received a telegram from the military headquarters in Fujian requesting the Central Government to issue bullets and purchase mules and horses to facilitate bandit suppression operations. He stated that the bandit suppression measures would be subject to the Central Government's command. It was reported that most of the remaining bandits in Fujian Province have been wiped out, with only bandit disturbances in northern Fujian and the Fujian-Jiangxi border. They are diligently advancing their bandit suppression plans. The army under its jurisdiction, consisting of the 60th, 61st, 78th, and 49th Divisions, and the Replacement Division, totals 60,000 men. The Central Government allocates 500,000 yuan in military expenses each month, and the October military expenses have already been received. The financial resources of Fujian Province are limited, and there have been rumors that the army will expand, but nothing has been heard of it here. (Central News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to those close to Chen Gongbo, Chen recently received letters and telegrams from the South proving that there is indeed new brewing in the Fujian situation, but it is by no means as severe as rumored. It is heard that Chen believes that at a time when the nation is in dire straits, it is time for the leaders of the Party and the nation to unite sincerely and work together to save the situation, and that it is not advisable to innovate and disrupt the overall situation. He has already based his actions on this idea and, in his personal capacity, sent telegrams to key figures in Fujian and Guangdong, urging them to reflect and work together to overcome the difficulties. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Tieya, the chief of general affairs of the 19th Route Army's office in Nanjing, said that he has repeatedly received telegrams from Commander Cai in recent days, still requesting the Central Government to provide subsidies, weapons, and ammunition. Chief Huang also telegraphed yesterday, stating that he would be able to complete his work and return to Nanjing in about a week. Chiang and Cai had long ago declared that the 19th Route Army would never participate in civil war, and their words are still fresh in our ears. How could they sacrifice their honor of resisting Japan? (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Increases Defenses on the East River</h3>
<h3>Generals' Meeting Decides to First Suppress Bandit Rebellions</h3>
<h3>Chen Jitang Sends Yang Dezhao to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Troops are being dispatched to the East River one after another. Tonight, a large army is being transferred from the Beijiang area on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border to the Fujian-Guangdong border. Huizhou is currently crowded with troops and has become a massive camp. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang has been holding important meetings with various generals at the Yantang Military Academy for several days. As a result, it has been decided to first suppress bandit rebellions in order to implement the Three-Year Construction Plan. (Central News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) It is rumored here that Fang Zhenwu has arrived in Hong Kong, and his whereabouts are being kept strictly secret. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Dezhao was previously ordered to go to Guangdong to explain the use of the cotton and wheat loan and the circumstances under which the Central Government could assist Guangdong to the extent possible. Recently, rumors about the Fujian incident have been very tense. Chen Jitang believes that the actual situation in Guangdong Province needs to be reported to the Central Government in detail. He sent Yang Dezhao to Beijing again. Yang himself telegraphed Beijing on the morning of the 17th, saying that he left Hong Kong on the 17th by ship via Shanghai. He will first go to Beijing to meet with President Wang and report everything in person, and then go to Jiangxi to visit Commander Chiang again. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The front-line official report was received today, stating that the bandit suppression troops in Fujian Province have won a great victory. The First Independent Division claims that on November 12, a large number of communist bandits attacked Yanping. The Guangdong army was in a precarious position, and after three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated, abandoning 400 corpses, 50 rifles, and 3 machine guns. Another official report stated that after the defeat of the red bandits in northern Fujian, they retreated. It is heard that food is insufficient and the weather is gradually getting colder, so the communist bandits' combat effectiveness has been greatly reduced. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Guangzhou is still mobilizing troops. The 4th Division boarded trains in Shaoguan today to go to Huizhou to strengthen the East River forces. It is rumored that the 19th Route Army is currently being reorganized into two armies. One is composed of the 49th, 61st, and 78th Divisions led by Dai Ji, and the other is composed of the 60th Division led by Cai Tingkai and the reserve team. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A certain official of the Guangdong Provincial Government mentioned today the attitude of Guangdong Province towards the development of Fujian Province, saying that Guangzhou will not participate in any movement aimed at breaking away from Nanjing. Furthermore, the Guangzhou News Agency declared that Guangdong Province is not listed in the Five-Province Alliance, which shows that Guangdong Province has nothing to do with the independence movement. Officials pointed out that the rumor that Guangdong Province would be drawn into civil war because of the Five-Province Alliance is an incredible event. Although it is rumored in official circles that Li Zongren will come to Guangdong, Reuters learned from reliable sources that Li has already gone from Nanning to Guilin. Therefore, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee has now sent Mai Huanzhang to Guilin via Wuzhou to meet with Li and ask him to come to Guangdong. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Bank Runs</h3>
<h3>Suspension of Exchange for Ten-Yuan Banknotes</h3>
<h3>Limited to One Month</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Due to the impact of the Fujian incident, there was a run on the Guangdong Provincial Bank on the 18th. The market value of the bank's banknotes fell to 80% on the morning of the 18th, and shops refused to use them. The bank has issued a total of more than 27 million banknotes, with only 5 million in reserves. The President of the bank, Shen Zaihe, consulted with the Finance Department and decided to suspend the exchange of ten-yuan banknotes from the 18th for a period of one month. One-yuan and five-yuan banknotes will still be exchanged as usual. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The price of Hong Kong dollars in Guangdong City suddenly rose. Every thousand Hong Kong dollars is worth 1,535 Guangdong dollars, a phenomenon unprecedented in history. This is because the authorities recently transported a large number of Guangdong dollars to Hong Kong to purchase military equipment, causing panic in the Guangdong banking industry. More than ten banks have collapsed due to runs in recent days. (Central News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Silver shops and stores today refused to accept banknotes from government banks, so thousands of people went to the Guangdong Provincial Bank to exchange their banknotes. The provincial government announced that, as an emergency measure, the exchange of ten-yuan banknotes would be suspended for one month, but one-yuan and five-yuan banknotes would still be exchanged as usual. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Movements in Rehe Are Very Busy</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People from Lingyuan reported that Japanese troops in Rehe have been traveling back and forth to Suizhong recently, and movements are very busy. A Japanese anti-aircraft artillery team is stationed at Mangniuyingzi, with four anti-aircraft guns and six anti-aircraft machine guns. On the 15th of this month, a lieutenant led more than 40 soldiers, carrying two anti-aircraft guns and four anti-aircraft machine guns, to Chengde. A second lieutenant led more than 30 soldiers, carrying two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns, to Chaoyang, in order to prevent Russian aircraft from reconnoitering Rehe again. The defenses left behind at Mangniuyingzi are being filled by Zhang HaiPeng's troops. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Unity and Responsibility (2)</h3>
<p>-- Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the meaning of unity and responsibility was discussed, and it was said that the central government has already assumed responsibility for facing the difficult situation. Today, the most difficult situation that the government must face is to work hard on suppressing bandits. However, bandit suppression cannot rely solely on the troops at the front. On the one hand, efforts should be made to prevent unexpected incidents at home from hindering the work of bandit suppression. On the other hand, local authorities in all provinces and regions should work hard to prevent bandits from infiltrating and to eliminate bandits in the rear to ensure the safety of the local people. And the local people should also work together to support all the work in the rear, and maintaining the security of the rear is an indirect way of assisting in bandit suppression. If this can be done, the task of bandit suppression will surely succeed easily. However, this cannot be done without national unity first.</p>
<p>The so-called unexpected incidents at home refer to the brewing of the Fujian Incident that has been rumored recently. However, the news of this Fujian Incident and the inside story are still unclear. If the brewing is indeed as publicized, and if this brewing does not work after open and honest mediation, then the government must suppress it with force. The use of force will inevitably lead to conflict, and conflict will inevitably devastate the region and cause suffering to the people. Not only will the people suffer, but the work of bandit suppression will also be affected, causing delays in the work that is about to be completed. Therefore, in today's tight situation, internal strife must not be allowed to occur again. Moreover, it is said that the center of the brewing of the Fujian Incident is the 19th Route Army. The 19th Route Army's resistance to Japan has won the sympathy of the whole nation, and people are rushing to help them because they can save the country. After the war, they also stated that they would not participate in civil war, which showed that they had no other intentions other than resisting Japan, and was especially appreciated by the people. Now, the news of the Fujian Incident has suddenly spread, which is truly shocking. Because today, the reason why the government is paying special attention to bandit suppression is precisely to save the country. If internal strife breaks out again, hindering the work of bandit suppression, it will not only be inconsistent with the purpose of not participating in civil war, but also seem to contradict the meaning of saving the country. If it is said that the government's approach cannot save the country, then try asking the 19th Route Army what approach it will take to save the country. To plan a coup without an approach is no different from those who are focused on creating chaos. The people have suffered from the ravages of war for a long time, and they have suffered deeply from the disasters of floods, droughts, and bandits. At present, they only seek to survive and do not want any further actions in the region that would hinder their security. Therefore, in the past, when the people heard about the 19th Route Army's resistance to Japan, they could not help but rejoice and rush to provide assistance, but now, because of participating in civil war, they will reverse their previous attitude. How could the 19th Route Army have no one who understands the stakes and act so recklessly? This is something that we cannot understand deeply. Therefore, before the true nature of the content is fully clarified, we dare not rashly make excessive speculation and definitive judgments, and it is enough to wait for a clear announcement in the future before commenting further.</p>
<p>We will now set aside the Fujian Incident and focus on the responsibility of local authorities in all provinces for bandit suppression, which is also very important. Today's bandit suppression work not only relies on the progress of the central front-line troops, but also depends on the concerted efforts of provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian. If the concerted attack is not strong enough, not only will the front-line troops not receive assistance, but they may also be disrupted, hindering the progress of the front. This is what the troops in all provinces and regions should strive for. As for the general population, they all hope to overcome national difficulties, carry out all kinds of construction, develop industry and commerce, and ensure local order and stability. However, the first step must be the success of bandit suppression. To achieve success in bandit suppression, the people in the rear must rise up together to make efforts to provide assistance. To have the people provide assistance together, the current situation of disunity cannot be of any help. Therefore, we must first encourage the spirit of unity and rise up to jointly shoulder this important responsibility.</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Delegations Abandon Original Claims: Self-Government Organization May Be Abandoned; Tianchi to Establish Self-Government Discussion Conference; Ikizaka Hiroshi and Others Inspect the Urad League</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, various princes will come to Suiyuan with Huang and Zhao to participate in a joint celebration.</p>
<p>Guihua: Prince Te and Prince Yun have abandoned their claim to organize a self-governing government and are willing to proceed according to the plan set by the central government. Currently, various princes are about to establish an Inner Mongolia self-government discussion conference in Tianchi to prepare for everything. The princes in Bailingmiao are scheduled to come to Suiyuan with Huang on the 20th to participate in the Mongolian-Han joint celebration. Ikizaka Hiroshi and others departed on the 18th to inspect the Urad League. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun will go to Suiyuan to meet Huang and discuss the Inner Mongolia self-government issue. Qin will go after Huang returns to Suiyuan from the temple. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjia previously sent Li Shoushan and Gong Ziwan to Mongolia for investigation. Li and Gong telegraphed from Ping that the investigation has been completed and they are expected to arrive in Ping around the 20th of this month. After Zhang returns to Ping with Li and Gong, he will be able to decide on the departure date. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bai Yunti said that he received a telegram from Huang yesterday, saying that the consultations with Prince Te, Prince Yun, and others in Bailingmiao were satisfactory. Recently, because Prince Te has accepted the central government's plan and abandoned the original proposal for an Inner Mongolia self-governing government, he has proposed a new plan for discussion. He will leave the temple around the 20th of this month and return to Suiyuan. The content of the new proposal is roughly divided into two items: (1) The issue of Inner Mongolia self-government. The representatives of various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia previously resolved at a meeting in Bailingmiao to adopt a self-governing government system, directly under the central government and the Suiyuan and Chahar provincial governments, as parallel agencies. The Suiyuan provincial authorities advocate that it be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. (2) The scope of the self-governing region. The northern part of Chahar, the Xilingol League, the Urad League north of the Daqing Mountains, the Ordos League in the Hetao area, and the Tumeds in the west will be designated as self-governing regions. Huang and Zhao will return to Suiyuan after the above issues have been discussed and resolved. The Suiyuan and Chahar authorities will exchange opinions and return to Beijing to decide on the entire plan. After Huang returns to Suiyuan, he plans to hold a Han-Mongolian joint celebration, but it is difficult to predict whether the various princes of Inner Mongolia will come to Suiyuan to participate. Zhangjia has telegraphed back to Prince Te and others, stating that he will stay in Ping due to business and will not go to Mongolia for the time being. He expressed his support for Inner Mongolia's self-government. He will go to Mongolia after meeting with Minister Huang in Ping. (18th Dispatch)</p>

The reception will begin as soon as the reception procedures have been negotiated. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Mountain urged the Political Committee to take over because the Japanese army in Shanhaiguan had been withdrawing to Jinzhou one after another. Huang Fu sent Tao Shangming to handle it. Tao is scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow to first contact Nakamura, the commander of the North China Garrison Army, because the garrison in Shanhaiguan is under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Garrison Army. Tao will transfer from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan to discuss with Endo after contacting Nakamura. After the consultation, the Linyu County Office can move into the old office in the city to work. The security in the city is the responsibility of the Changli Security Team. Currently, the 14th Mixed Brigade troops in Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe, and Qinhuangdao have been transferred to the northern part of Manchuria. Only a garrison of more than 200 people remains in Shanhaiguan. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that the security teams at the major passes of the Great Wall have mostly arrived one after another. The local administration is under my exercise of power and is in fact the reception. There are many small passes on the Great Wall, and the security teams cannot fully reach each pass for garrison for a while. The Japanese army has not withdrawn because it cannot find houses temporarily. The Japanese Kwantung Army promised to return Shanhaiguan first, and we have sent personnel to negotiate within days. The Jizhou-Miyun Commissioner's Office is preparing to set up an office in Miyun to facilitate contact with the Japanese at any time. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Flies to Ping: The Bandit Troubles in Eastern Luan Are Expected to Be Completely Eliminated Soon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Ping this afternoon. He will meet Huang and He in days to report on important matters. According to him, he has no important business in Ping and will return to Tianjin after staying for a few days. Large groups of bandits in eastern Luan have left the Great Wall and fled to the Lingnan area in Rehe. Other small groups can also be wiped out. The bandit troubles in eastern Luan are expected to be completely eliminated soon. It was previously reported that Shanhaiguan may be received this month, but the latest situation is unknown. The military pay for the North China Army reported by Hebei Province was originally 500,000 yuan per month, but in recent years, many tax revenues in the war zone have been exempted, and the three counties in southern Hebei have suffered floods. In addition, the incorporation of the troops of Li Jichun, Shi Yousan, and others, and the pay for the security teams have been borne by the provincial government at 470,000 yuan. In the future, the expenses for the security teams and others in eastern Luan will still require 200,000 yuan per month. Therefore, only 200,000 yuan can be reported each month. If the order in the counties recovers and income improves after six months, more may be transferred. Lu Muting went to Beijing earlier to report to the central government on the financial difficulties and expenditures of Hebei Province. He has now returned to Tianjin. Song is gradually recovering from his waist disease in Tianjin. It is heard that he will stay in Tianjin for some time. (18th Dispatch)</p>

It has been decided to establish customs offices at the passes, but the name has not yet been determined. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying it. It is heard that taxes will be levied under the names of Tianjin Customs and Qinhuangdao Customs branch offices. The Ministry of Finance must submit the proposed plan to the Central Political Council for resolution, so it is difficult to achieve in the short term. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Boundary Dispute Between Nanjing City and Jiangning County Has Not Been Resolved</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The boundary demarcation issue between the Nanjing Municipal Government and Jiangning County has been in dispute for a long time and has not yet been resolved. Jiangning County's reason is that it is currently a self-governing experimental county focusing on construction. It firmly claims that the original demarcation of the city area hinders county governance and must be changed. As for the registration and transfer of books, etc., these are all matters for later. The reason of the Municipal Government is that various taxes and levies in the city have been successively opened, but only the land tax has not been collected because the household name atlas has not been approved for transfer by the Jiangning County Government. Before the demarcation by the provincial government is completed, the management power of the city only extends to the scope of the Capital Police Department. Within this scope, those households who should have paid the land tax earlier have not paid to the city. Jiangning County is afraid that it will be difficult to collect taxes beyond its authority. If this is delayed for a long time, this land tax will be invisibly lost once the land is transferred. The issue was raised for discussion at the municipal meeting on the 18th, and it was resolved to urge Jiangning County to quickly hand over the collection books for collection. It was also said that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had agreed to the transfer of the books, but Jiangning County was unwilling to do so immediately. The Municipal Government will take effective measures to urge the county to comply. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Government Issues Travel Expenses to Overseas Representatives</h3>

<h3>Liu Eqing and Others Draft Opinions on Rectifying the Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisory Committee member Liu Eqing and others believe that the central government has promulgated the opium prohibition law, but many places do not implement it properly. There are even methods of supervising the sale of opium, which is equivalent to open sales, which ultimately leads to the judicial and administrative aspects often conflicting in their views on opium prohibition incidents. Liu and others are drafting an opinion letter, scheduling a discussion meeting of all supervisory committee members next Thursday to exchange opinions, and appointing personnel to be responsible for drafting. After Yu Youren returns to Beijing to review it, they will make suggestions to the central government or accommodate the facts, simply change the opium prohibition law, and stipulate the order of phased prohibition, so as to avoid the current opium prohibition law being equivalent to a mere formality.

<h3>US-Russia Negotiations Successful: Roosevelt Goes to Hot Springs</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has already set off to rest at the hot springs. The exchange of notes between Roosevelt and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov has just been published. Litvinov gave a written guarantee that Soviet policy would thoroughly respect the right of the United States to determine its own existence. The Soviet Union absolutely does not interfere in the affairs of the United States and its territories. The Soviet government will stop all propaganda made by Soviet officials or personnel directly or indirectly managed by the Soviet government, the purpose of which is to infringe on American territory or change the American political organization by violence. In addition to the Washington government, all groups claiming to represent the American government or seeking to overthrow the American government by violence are not allowed to exist in the Soviet Union or to engage in the organization of various organizations within the Soviet Union. Those who aim to use violence to overthrow the American political and social order are also not allowed to exist in the Soviet Union. In President Roosevelt's reply, he guaranteed that the United States would follow the same policy towards the Soviet Union. In addition, there is another note that specifically discusses religious issues. The Soviet Union allows American citizens to build churches in the Soviet Union, and the houses used can receive donations for religious purposes. The two sides also exchanged views on the establishment of consular treaties, the application of most-favored-nation treatment, and the protection of overseas Chinese. Even the Soviet government has the right to file a lawsuit for the private debts that the previous governments of Russia could demand from the United States, and it is now acknowledged to be abandoned. (Havas Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the exchange of notes between Roosevelt and Litvinov, although the Soviet government gave up its demands on the US intervention in Siberia, this intervention does not include the US intervention in Archangelsk. The Soviet government still maintains its demands on the US regarding this intervention. According to reports, in 1918, the US government sent 7,000 troops to land in Vladivostok, with the aim of preventing German prisoners in the area from rearming to resist the Allied forces, so it sent an expeditionary force. At that time, the commander of the American expeditionary force was ordered to maintain strict neutrality in the conflict between the White Russians and the Red Russians, but after 4,700 American troops landed in Archangelsk, they actually participated in the battle against the Soviet army. During this expedition, 200 American soldiers were killed and 300 were injured. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Russian Embassy Red Flag Waving in the Wind</h3>
<p>(Washington) The most prominent sign of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is that the red flag of the Soviet Union was hoisted above the Russian Embassy here this afternoon. The embassy was officially handed over to Litvinov by the State Department today. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Pretends to Be Calm</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Daily News this morning, the United States recognized Russia yesterday, and Litvinov and Roosevelt issued a joint statement. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has a great impact on the European political situation. It is not surprising that the United States and Russia are trying to get closer for the sake of their own economic recovery. There are rumors that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is intended to contain Japan's policy toward China and change the peaceful policy in the Far East, but Japan's policy toward Russia still takes peaceful means to resolve disputes between the two countries, so the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has nothing to do with Japan. This is how the Japanese side is trying to maintain a calm attitude. (United China News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Worried About US-Russia Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today saying that although the main reason for the United States' recognition of Russia is to seek commercial interests, it may also be intended to contain Japan's actions in the Far East, but it will not drastically change its attitude toward Japan. There are rumors that after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, Russia will withdraw its proposal to sell the China Eastern Railway, which will not become a reality. Military cooperation may be brought up again, but even if it is a rumor, it must be taken into account. The United States, Russia, and China will be closer in 1936 than they are now. (United China News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Daily News, the United States and Russia discussed the issue of Japanese aggression against Russian territory during the negotiations for the restoration of diplomatic relations. The Japanese believe that the US President agreed to guarantee that Russia would maintain its national borders in the Far East, intending to jointly defend against Japan. The seventh document exchanged between the two countries and Litvinov's speech prove the truth of this matter. (United China News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is watching the impact of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia on the Far Eastern political situation, and its general observations are as follows: (1) There is no doubt that the United States intends to use the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia as a means of containing Japan, but President Roosevelt will not, therefore, make the policy toward Japan a concrete reinforcement. (2) On the contrary, the Soviet Union, by inducing the United States to assist the Soviet Union, especially to strengthen its attitude toward Japan, will gain a great deal. For example, the recent rumors of the withdrawal of the North Manchuria Railway negotiations, although they may be a propaganda effect, are also an expression of this. (3) It is still unclear whether the United States and Russia can establish an agreement against Japan in the future, but there are rumors that a secret agreement was signed last July, when the United States recognized the Soviet Union in exchange for the establishment of military interests in Kamchatka. Also, the United States, in view of its deep fear of Japan occupying the coastal province of Soviet Russia, Japan must pay attention to this. (4) As a result of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, China's attitude toward Japan will not change abruptly. (5) Japan, according to the decision of the Five Ministers' Conference, gives first priority to the development of Manchuria, but as a precautionary measure, it should implement diplomatic work with the United States, China, and Russia.

<h3>Military Authorities Say Japan Is Not Under Any Threat</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army authorities' observations on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia are as follows: They express their deep congratulations for the sake of world peace. Since they do not know the conditions for the restoration of diplomatic relations, they cannot elaborate. The debts of the past may be gradually resolved. As for the impact of the rapprochement between the United States and Russia on Japan, it is expected that it will not be worse than it is today. (Electric News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy Ministry authorities issued a statement today saying that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia was a matter of time and is not surprising, but Japan will not be threatened in any way by the US-Russia tie-up, and the United States and Russia will not change their attitude toward Japan for the sake of restoring diplomatic relations. (United China News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Russia's Attitude Toward Japan Will Become Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The United States and Russia cleared up the 16-year state of severance and formally restored diplomatic relations, and all parties in Japan are paying the greatest attention to the future. The handshake and cooperation between the Soviet Union, the only proletarian dictatorship in the world today, and the capitalist country of the United States is a very interesting issue in international politics. A certain aspect of Japan anticipates the future as follows: The conditions for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia were not specific items such as the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty or the establishment of a huge credit system, so in reality, there will be no immediate special impact. However, the scope of negotiations between the Soviet Union and other countries, such as debt issues, and the negation of religion, an important principle of communism, the Soviet Union must use this restoration of diplomatic relations to implement plans, and its direct and indirect impact is by no means small. The Soviet Union will definitely strengthen its attitude toward Europe in the future, and especially its attitude toward the Far East will be even stronger. The negotiations for the sale of the China Eastern Railway will inevitably be delayed as a result, and as a result of its strong attitude toward Manchukuo, various problems may occur between the two sides one after another. However, the United States has abandoned the so-called Stimson Doctrine on the Far East issue, and its decided policy is not to actively interfere in various issues unless American interests are infringed upon. It is also transferring the Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic Ocean in order to ease the atmosphere between the United States and Japan, so what kind of active attitude can it take in the Far East? The most significant impact on the Far East and the world as a result of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is that the Soviet Union will use the United States' abundant financial resources to carry out economic construction and industrial plans in order to redize China, India, and other countries. (Japan United News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy Toward the Puppet State Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the US recognition of Soviet Russia, the Manchukuo military and political authorities said the following: Even if the United States recognizes Soviet Russia, the military and political authorities do not consider it a problem. It is the trend of the times that capitalist America recognizes communist Soviet Russia. Manchukuo must further cooperate with Japan based on its established policy to deal with the situation. Only in the worst-case scenario is there better effort in strengthening national defense. (Electric News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the US-Russia restoration of diplomatic relations, Hoshino, Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, said that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is a natural thing and has no economic impact on Manchukuo. The economic relations between Russia and Manchukuo are gradually improving, and relations with the United States are also turning better. Therefore, Manchukuo will always maintain its relations with Europe and the United States in accordance with the fundamental policy of open doors and equal opportunities.

<h3>A Coolant for the Tense Situation in the Far East: League of Nations Members Express Welcome</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva tonight welcomes the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. League of Nations members believe that this move can automatically reduce the possibility of conflict in the Far East, but regret that both countries have not joined the League of Nations. The general opinion here is that this move by the United States can be followed by countries that have not yet restored diplomatic relations with Russia, and it is expected that some countries will soon recognize Soviet Russia. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Articles from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(America) (Washington) The "New York Evening Post Forum" expressed satisfaction with the agreement reached between the United States and Russia, stating that this agreement holds the Soviet government responsible for the activities of the Communist Party within the United States. If necessary, the United States could withdraw its recognition of the Soviet Union. An editorial in the "New York Times" recounted the changes in US-Russian relations since 1918. Of particular note is a section in the "Short News" column on page 24 of today's "New York Times," which stated that Soviet national securities can now have their interest paid at a major bank in New York. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(England) (London) Today's London newspapers are full of commentary on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. An editorial in the London Exchange Telegraph Company stated that the reasons for the rapprochement are: (1) the United States urgently needs the Russian market; (2) Russia urgently needs American credit and loans; (3) the two countries have common interests in the Far East. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Germany) (Berlin) The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" commented this morning on the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, saying that Japan's policy on the Asian continent will be greatly affected. It also stated that the resumption of relations will consolidate the Soviet Union's military position, because using American experience and sponsorship to realize the Soviet Union's aviation development plan will have real value. Other German newspapers expressed largely the same views. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Italy) Rome Political commentators here believe that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia will greatly benefit American business, especially cotton and textiles. While the basis of the understanding between the US President and Litvinov is still rarely heard, it is believed that it must involve close political cooperation in the Far East, or that the agreement may contain military clauses in order to prevent Japanese aggression. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Austria) Vienna This morning, newspapers extensively reported on the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, but there was not much commentary. The "Neue Freie Presse" believed that the agreement between the United States and Russia was not based on economic considerations. Foreign policy considerations are the important reasons for the rapprochement between the two countries. The Soviet Union is deeply afraid that Japan will take control of the situation in the Far East, or even engage in combat. President Roosevelt's warm reception of Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov is nothing short of a warning to Japan. (Havas dispatch, 18th) (Poland) Warsaw The news of the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union arrived here late, so Polish newspapers this morning did not have time to comment. However, political circles expressed considerable sympathy for the alliance between Moscow and Washington. Former Polish Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Patek, who signed the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, is now the Polish Ambassador to the United States. Patek put forth great effort in this resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. In general, it is believed that the rapprochement between the United States and Russia will be beneficial to world peace. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Russia Negotiates with Mexico to Restore Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Mexico City It is rumored that the Soviet Russian government is negotiating with Mexico in the hopes of restoring diplomatic relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs neither denies nor confirms this news. The Soviet Russian diplomatic representative engaged in propaganda in Mexico, which led to the interruption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Mexico several years ago.

<h3>Japan's Budget Difficulties: Army and Navy Demand Full Amount Be Approved</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army submitted its requests for reinstatement to the Ministry of Finance before the 20th. The contents are roughly as follows: (1) The assessed amount for the Manchurian Incident expenses is 123 million, but a reinstatement of the requested amount of 156 million is demanded. (2) The assessed amount for material maintenance expenses is 80 million, but the requested amount of 150 million is demanded. (3) A reinstatement of the entirely eliminated fuel research fee of 5 million from other new requests is demanded. The total amount of the reinstatement request is approximately 108 million. (Dentsu dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Each cabinet member deeply understands Finance Minister Takahashi's difficulties regarding the Ministry of Finance's major cuts to the next year's budget. However, there is considerable dissatisfaction within the Navy Department and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Negotiations for reinstatement requests will be conducted with the financial authorities within a day or two. If Finance Minister Takahashi completely disregards the intentions of the Five Ministers' Conference and the Internal Affairs Conference, there is a risk of triggering a political crisis. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito is also deeply concerned and will not go for his usual weekend rest on the 18th but will quietly observe the situation. He may personally step in to mediate between Finance Minister Takahashi, Navy Minister Osumi, and Agriculture Minister Goto. Thus, the budget cabinet meeting on the 21st has been postponed to the 24th. (Dentsu dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy held a department meeting today to deliberate on budget countermeasures. An extraordinary meeting will be held tomorrow, even though it is a Sunday. Of the ¥690 million budget requested by the Navy Department, ¥262 million was cut by the Ministry of Finance. Only ¥178 million was approved for military expansion expenses, which is far from the original plan. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance changed the two-year plan for the aviation corps, scheduled to be completed in 1936, to a five-year plan to be completed in 1939. The Navy authorities believe that this violates the resolutions of the Five Ministers' Conference and shows a lack of understanding of the international crisis. Only the refurbishment of battleships was approved for warship refurbishment expenses, and the refurbishment of aircraft carriers and cruisers was not approved. Among the 53 vessels outside treaty limitations, the Ministry of Finance only approved 15. It is questioned how such a situation can cope with the Pacific crisis in 1936. A decision was made to demand approval of the full amount, and the Vice Minister and Director of the Bureau of Accounting will contact the Ministry of Finance. Navy Minister Osumi will also personally visit Finance Minister Takahashi to seek a political solution. (United China News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received its budget for the next fiscal year from the Ministry of Finance on the 17th.

<p>Total Budget: 26,700, of which Regular Department: 17,600, Temporary Department: 9,100. Total amount of new budget requests: 8,900, of which Regular Department: 1,800, Temporary Department: 7,100.

<h3>The Theory of Ugaki Entering Politics: People from Both Political and Civil Parties Participate in the Planning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It seems that Governor-General Ugaki of Korea is gradually moving towards political opportunities. He will soon depart from Seoul to Tokyo, and some even say that he will resign from the position of Governor-General at the same time, specifically to adopt a waiting stance for the next government. It is said that this theory is due to the fact that Secretary Yasui Seiichiro of the Governor-General's Office, who previously went to Beijing, conducted reconnaissance in various political circles. The Governor-General obtained this information and then decided to rise up. As for the Governor-General Ugaki's entry into political circles, his interlocutors in Tokyo are Yosuke Matsuoka, who attended the League of Nations, and others. It is heard that some members from both the Zhengmin Party and the Civil Party are also participating in the planning behind the scenes. Due to the current situation, various political circles are paying close attention to Ugaki's actions. (Dentsu dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>New US Treasury Secretary Takes Office: Government Temporarily Suspends Purchase of Government Bonds Before Gold Purchase Plan Takes Effect</h3>
<p>(Washington) Acting US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau went to the White House this morning to take the oath of office. The US President personally administered the oath. After the ceremony, the President delivered a speech praising the Treasury Secretary's achievements. Subsequently, the US President left Beijing at 5:58 pm to go to the hot springs for rest. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has decided to temporarily abandon the plan to purchase 3 billion gold dollars worth of government bonds in the open market through the Federal Reserve Bank before the gold dollar movement produces results. Officials in the Ministry of Finance claim that suspending the purchase of government bonds is unimportant because only 800 million gold dollars have been purchased so far. If the government's plan to issue new bonds to replace old bonds encounters difficulties, it can still resume purchasing. However, some observers of current events claim that this move is due to the Federal Reserve Bank's refusal to support the government bond market after a split in opinions within the government on the monetary plan. Others hold the opposite view, believing that the Gold Purchase Plan of the Finance Rehabilitation Company is intended to supplement the open market securities purchase plan. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A group of influential industrialists in the United States who advocate increasing national purchasing power and prices organized a National Committee. Today, they held a monetary conference here, supporting the US President's plan to raise the price of gold and lower the price of the gold dollar. However, they advised the government to expand its policy and include silver as a national currency reserve. According to Senator Pittman, President Roosevelt is now willing to consider the proposal to mint silver coins using domestically produced silver. However, because there are many currency proposals from all parties, and their contents often vary greatly, the President is currently considering several silver coin minting proposals. We should give them a chance to experiment and not pressure them too much. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Fiscal Policy: Budget Strives for Balance</h3>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Bonnet said today at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives that it is extremely important to balance the budget, saying that it is urgently necessary to maintain public trust, especially because the United States is conducting monetary experiments. He estimates that the Ministry of Finance will need to raise an additional 17 billion francs in 1934, and may have to rely on borrowing to raise them. Bonnet also said that the United States has actually stopped buying gold, and the stability of the franc has not been affected. If the budget案 can be balanced and the position of the Treasury can be secured, then financial difficulties will naturally not occur. The committee meeting is still held as usual, non-publicly.

<h3>Hungary and the League of Nations: Whether to Withdraw Has Not Yet Been Determined</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Former Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen gave a speech to the local stock exchange, saying that since various countries are unwilling to actually recognize Germany's equal rights to armaments, and are delaying its implementation through various methods, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations does not need to seek anyone's understanding. He also said that whether Hungary will withdraw from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has not yet been definitively decided, but it wants to avoid hasty actions. As for rumors about the danger of war, "There is danger only if France and the Little Entente countries are determined to provoke armed conflict." Bethlen also advocated using peaceful means to amend various peace treaties. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Arrive in Geneva: Italian Representative and Czech Foreign Minister Have Also Departed. Parisian Public Opinion Strongly Advocates Direct Negotiations with Germany: France Submits Strict Military Supervision Plan to Disarmament Conference: Four-Power Conference Will Be Abandoned Due to French Opposition</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The chances of negotiating disarmament with Germany outside of Geneva have greatly decreased today. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour told reporters that France believes that the drafting of a disarmament convention should continue in Geneva. Therefore, informed observers generally believe that it is clearly difficult to reach an agreement with Germany under the current circumstances. Simon and Eden both met with Henderson this afternoon, and Paul-Boncour visited Simon and Henderson separately in the afternoon. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Three major European politicians arrived here in succession today to assist Henderson in rescuing the collapsing Disarmament Conference. The three were British Foreign Secretary Simon, British Undersecretary Eden, both from London, and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, who was invited by Simon and Eden when they passed through Paris. It is heard that Simon visited Henderson in the morning, urging him not to lose heart. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Undersecretary Eden both arrived at the office of the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference at noon today. Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, immediately received them. The two sides talked for a long time. People here claim that this meeting was only a courtesy visit, but under the current circumstances, since various accidents occurred in Britain this week, affecting its internal affairs, this kind of talk can be regarded as having substance. British representatives have not yet agreed with French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour on a meeting time, and are expected to meet in the afternoon. In addition, de Laguna, Chief of Staff of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, has reportedly departed for Geneva to replace the country's representative, Aloisi. Foreign offices of various countries are working hard to urge this gentleman to come so that he can contact representatives from various countries. A spokesman for the British delegation declared that there was no truth to the trips of Foreign Secretary Simon and Undersecretary Eden to Rome. Moreover, the idea of moving the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference to another location is inappropriate and impossible to realize. Czech Foreign Minister Piniés, the General Rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference, has now left the Czech capital and is expected to arrive here early on Sunday. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour issued a statement upon arriving in Geneva, saying that we have absolutely not changed anything. Although Germany unfortunately withdrew from the Disarmament Conference, it will not affect our established policies. British Foreign Secretary Simon and Undersecretary Eden have already arrived here, and Czech Foreign Minister Piniés will arrive soon. The Italian representative, de Saragna, Chief of Staff of Prime Minister Mussolini, will also come here. The Disarmament Conference will resume active work based on the foundations we obtained last month, without any hindrance, and this is a genuine opportunity to produce a suitable disarmament convention. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome According to today's official statement, the Italian Chief Representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, was unable to go to Geneva to meet British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour due to being busy. The Italian government has decided to send Saragna instead. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Czech Capital Foreign Minister Piniés, the General Rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference, is scheduled to depart for Geneva the day after tomorrow and will stay for several days. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee for Discussing the Supervision of Armaments has now proposed a new French supervision plan, the purpose of which is to conduct strict checks to ensure the proper implementation of the Disarmament Convention. The plan lists three types of supervision: (1) Supervision of documents, which specifically reports the number of troops and combat products, and issues licenses for the manufacture of munitions; (2) Supervision of expenses; (3) Supervision of on-site inspections, and proposes not only periodic, automatic, and permanent supervision, but also sudden investigations without prior notice to avoid eliminating unfavorable evidence.

<h3>Naval Competition Between Britain, the United States, and Japan: Japan Increases Navy Personnel by 40,000: The United States Increases by 39,700</h3>
<p>(London) The British Naval Minister answered questions in the House of Commons today comparing the number of naval personnel in various countries around the world. It is said that since 1914, the United States has increased by 39,700 people, and Japan has increased by about 30,000 people, while Britain alone has decreased by about 55,400 people.

<h3>Two Famous British Figures Oppose Further Reducing Armaments: Restore 1933 Shipbuilding Program</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, many famous British figures discussed the issue of disarmament. Churchill spoke at a political meeting, still strongly opposing further disarmament talks, saying that it is harmful and useless. Baldwin spoke in Edinburgh, strongly defending the government's and Locarno Treaty, saying that if treaty obligations are not fulfilled, Britain cannot guarantee peace, and cannot continue to reduce armaments. Those who like trouble and those who like to talk about war are merely instigating unrest. Land Minister Halesham spoke in Brighton, saying that Britain intends to reduce its armaments to the extreme. Today's British army is almost only a police force to protect the British Empire. It is important to know that in today's Britain, military strength is the most important guarantee of world peace. Aviation Minister London Terry spoke in Bristol, opposing Britain's continued reduction of armaments, believing that this would only make people more uneasy. At the same time, Lord Jacob declared that the current strength of the British Navy is woefully inadequate. In any case, naval strength must be increased. According to the British Naval Minister's statement in the House of Commons a few days ago, in view of the fact that the United States and Japan both want to build ten 10,000-ton cruisers, each equipped with fifteen 6-inch guns, after extremely careful consideration, they have to restore the 1933 program, which includes adding two new 9,000-ton cruisers. According to British naval experts, even if Britain adds two cruisers, it still cannot eliminate the extremely poor position of British cruisers. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<h3>Bombings Occur on the Same Day in Austria, Spain, and Egypt: University Suspends Classes, Food Industry Strikes</h3>
<p>(London) Today, bombings occurred in Barcelona in Spain, Cairo in the Egyptian capital, and Innsbruck in Austria. The University of Innsbruck suspended classes today because students from the National Socialist Party threw smoke bombs. The food industry in Barcelona began a strike a few days ago, affecting 90,000 people. Today, two electrical appliances in an electrical factory were destroyed by bombs. However, shops have been ordered to open uniformly by the Catalan government. The Cairo police station received an anonymous letter stating that a bomb was placed outside a school. The police rushed to inspect and found a bomb, the same as the ones found elsewhere in the city. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Side Promotes Direct Negotiations: Parisian Times Expresses Concerns About Germany's Attitude</h3>
<p>(Paris) One of the most fiercely debated issues among French people for the past fifteen years, whether direct negotiations can be conducted between Germany and France, is now once again in the limelight in French public opinion. Since the German people's self-determination election and the foreign policy debates in the French Parliament, the number of supporters of direct negotiations has suddenly increased, and their power is also on the rise. The Morning Post, which has a large circulation, has now suddenly become a propaganda organ for promoting direct negotiations. The reason for the Morning Post's sudden change in attitude, according to its own transmission, is that since the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the negotiations between Germany and France have been completely ineffective and extremely disappointing. To this day, other than those who are inclined to commit suicide, no one wants this kind of situation to continue. The report further stated that conducting negotiations with Germany does not necessarily require the conclusion of a treaty, but it would be beneficial to hear Germany's conditions and consider them without intermediaries. Furthermore, the newspaper run by French perfume king Coty also supports direct negotiations between Germany and France. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and French Representative Massigli went to Geneva with British Foreign Minister Simon in the same car tonight. The Parisian Times published an editorial on this matter, warning readers that the intention of the British and French politicians in going to Geneva together this time is to restore the Disarmament Conference and make it successful as soon as possible. However, the future is extremely difficult and huge, because the Disarmament Conference must first draft a treaty, and Germany must be able to accept it. As for Germany's future attitude, the newspaper is quite concerned, and said that if there are any surprising developments in the future, we should not be surprised. The report also said that in any case, no more concessions should be made to Germany to induce it to return to Geneva. However, all countries should act as the rear guard of the League of Nations, because the League of Nations is currently in its most difficult period. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Guide the Huai River: The Gengkuan Funds Can Be Appropriated Immediately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The case of the Huai River Guiding Committee borrowing 8 million yuan from the Gengkuan funds was stalled due to Song Ziwen's resignation. Recently, after Finance Minister Kong took office, the committee sent a letter urging the matter, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed to be responsible for the guarantee. What needs to be further negotiated is only how many millions of yuan will be borrowed from the existing Gengkuan funds and the Gengkuan funds that have not yet matured, and the distribution of principal and interest repayment methods. Once these procedures are negotiated, appropriation can begin. Regarding the engineering plan for guiding the Huai River upstream and downstream, the engineering department, based on the survey report, stated that the Shaobo Lake lock and the Huaiyin dike project are part of the entire engineering plan. Currently, the design team of the engineering department is planning to start collecting land and accurately calculate the engineering materials, how to purchase them, an estimate of the cost of materials, and preparations for hiring workers and management.

<h3>Negotiations on Pacific Company Directly Collecting Telegraph Fees</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications investigated that the Pacific Telegraph Company has been directly collecting telegraph fees from recipients for telegrams sent to the interior of our country and abroad. It was recently discovered that there are two places, Qingdao and Hankou. The telegrams sent to Hankou are marked with the letters BIP, but the telegrams sent to Qingdao are not marked. This telegram is directly charged, and the company calculates it at the US dollar price, charging a lower fee, privately negotiating, hoping to deceive the Bureau, absorb telegraphic services, and violate the contract, so it has contacted the company to negotiate, and has sent a circular to the bureaus, informing all merchants that all telegraph fees should be collected by the bureaus, and ordering the International Telegraph Bureau to report the details so that further negotiations can be carried out.

<h3>The Huai River Conservancy Takes Over the灘蕩 (Tan Dang) and Lake Fields of the Huai River Basin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past, the公地 (Public lands) of the 灘蕩 (Tan Dang) and lake fields in the Huai River basin were allocated by bureaus established by various provinces. The Huai River Conservancy, according to Article 4 of its organizational law, which stipulates that matters such as surveying, registration, requisition, and consolidation during the Huai River construction period shall be temporarily handled by the Conservancy, and having jointly formulated a 14-article outline of measures for consolidating the land in the Huai River basin with the Executive Yuan, has consulted with the governments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces separately after being approved and put on record by the National Government, to negotiate the handover.

<h3>Japanese Reporter Stationed in Russia Discusses the Perilous State of Japanese-Russian Relations - Subtly Criticizing the Failure of Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>▲ The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 13th carried a telegram from Special Correspondent Fuse in Vladivostok, stating: "When I (Fuse refers to himself) was traveling in Moscow, I participated in the 15th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution last autumn and the anniversary celebration this spring, twice visiting the Red Square parade. At that time, hundreds of military aircraft were flying in formation over Moscow. On the morning of November 7th, I left Moscow for Vladivostok, but I did not forget to observe the 16th anniversary of the October Revolution, witnessing the spectacle of more than a dozen heavy bombers and a dozen fighter planes soaring together over the Golden Horn Bay. Recalling last autumn, a Russian leader said to me (Japan's) Plenipotentiary Matsuoka Yosuke, 'The Red Army's heavy bombers can fly over the Sea of Japan overnight, destroy the Japanese naval port of Sasebo, and slowly fly back to their bases in the coastal province.' Although this was a threat from Russia to Representative Matsuoka, its current strength can be imagined. Originally, the Russian government's foreign policy adopted a peaceful approach, so it repeatedly proposed to various countries to conclude non-aggression treaties, because Russia's defense still had shortcomings. However, this was only an observation of two or three years ago; today's situation is very different. It is inevitable that our country's (referring to Japan) foreign policy towards Russia has been mistaken. Why? In the past, Russia repeatedly proposed to us to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but it has not been realized to this day. Although Russia verbally advocates peace, it spares no effort in actually strengthening its national defense strength. When I was in Moscow, I often clearly questioned the Russian authorities, saying, 'If Japan and the United States were to go to war, would Russia attack Japan from behind?' And they all answered in unison, 'Socialist countries do not want to join wars between capitalist countries.' They also said, 'If this kind of behavior were to occur, we would have no face to face Lenin in the afterlife, and even loyal communist party members would deny taking advantage of the Japanese-American war to adopt an aggressive policy, hoping to benefit like a fisherman; if we were to abandon peaceful diplomacy and turn to an aggressive policy, Russia would not only have no benefits to speak of, but would also expose the flaws of Bolshevism,' and so on. In the past, when I stayed in Moscow, I participated in gatherings of important figures from Japan and Russia, and I heard Russians bring up the issue of renaming Vladivostok. Because many Russian cities have been renamed since the revolution, they planned to rename Vladivostok Uladiv-Gaugazhi, which means changing from aggression to peace. From this, it can be seen that Russia is inherently peace-loving. Unexpectedly, three Japanese planes suddenly appeared in the sky over Slavyanka, and Russia was greatly disturbed. In Xiongji Chong, Japan, strange planes also appeared. At the same time, the sky over the border between Korea and Russia suddenly presented an uneasy atmosphere of rumors and fear. Therefore, the most worrying thing at present is the rapid deterioration of Japanese-Russian relations and the occurrence of conflict. Looking back, Japanese-Russian relations have deteriorated considerably within a year, but when I arrived in Moscow, it was the period of improved Japanese-Russian relations. At that time, it was the Kherlen River incident, and Russia showed great goodwill towards Japan. Therefore, the Russian authorities warmly welcomed Plenipotentiary Matsuoka's visit to Moscow. At that time, Russia very much hoped to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, but the Japanese government had been studying the pending non-aggression treaty for one or two years, and there has been no progress to this day, which is due to the lack of preparation for diplomatic negotiations. At that time, Russia emphasized the clear demarcation of the Russian-Manchurian border and that the Japanese-Manchurian treaty should not conflict with the Beijing Treaty and the Fengtian Treaty. However, Plenipotentiary Matsuoka had no preparation for negotiation, thus missing a good opportunity. When Matsuoka met with Litvinov, Karakhan, Radek, etc., it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for good Japanese-Russian relations. Later, Ambassador Ota Sakei and Counselor Kaneko took office, reorganized the diplomatic lineup, and negotiated with Russia. Negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway began, and Russia also rejected the invitation to form an alliance. Other issues were also gradually being discussed. Unexpectedly, the opportunity was lost, negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway stopped, the Manchurian-Russian conflict became increasingly pressing, and Japanese-Russian relations rapidly deteriorated. At this point, Russia released secret documents, and the rumors of a Japanese-Russian war spread around the world. For example, a news agency in a certain European country even telegraphed its special correspondent in Moscow, 'After the Japanese-Russian war breaks out, you should go to the front line as a war correspondent.' The precariousness of Japanese-Russian relations is such that their fate hangs by a thread."</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Arrives in Nanchang - Reports to Chiang Kai-shek on the Situation in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice, arrived in Wan at 4:00 PM on the 15th. Because it was late, he stayed overnight in Xunyang and took a special train of the Nanxun Railway Bureau to the province on the morning of the 16th, arriving at Niuhang Station at 12:00 noon. After getting off the train and entering the city, he stayed at the Provincial Government Guesthouse and then went to Chiang Kai-shek's residence to meet with Chiang, reporting on the political, military, social, diplomatic, and economic situation in Xinjiang, as well as the internal conflicts of Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying occupying territories and fighting for power. He also discussed with Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and other members of the Central Supervisory Committee after arriving in Nanjing to resolve the political direction of Xinjiang and the border regions. Chiang hosted a banquet for Luo, He Chengjun, Liu Zhenhua, Zhang Ji, and others at 7:00 PM that evening, which lasted until midnight. Luo will stay in Jiangxi for several days and will inspect the Jiangxi Higher Court, Nanchang District Court, and the First Prison Detention Center in the coming days before returning to Nanjing.

<h3>Xuwan Is Again Under Bandit Attack - This Battle Is of Great Importance to the Future of Bandit Suppression - All Circles Send 10,000 Yuan to Fuzhou to Reward the Troops</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: The battle of Xuwan in the Northern Route Army is of paramount importance to the overall situation in Eastern Jiangxi and the safety of Fuzhou. After the desperate and bloody battles of the Fourth Division and the Thirty-sixth Division, the main force of the false Third and Seventh Army Corps was completely defeated, and Fuzhou turned from danger to safety, which is indeed a fortunate event.</p>
<p>Earlier, the bandits used the false 15th Army Corps to contain the southeastern forces of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army in Lichuan, Nancheng, and Nanfeng, and secretly had Peng Dehuai of the false Third Army Corps and Fang Zhimin of the false Seventh Army Corps sneak into Jinxi. Fearing airplanes, they moved by night, desperately attacking westward, vainly hoping to bypass the rear of the National Army and seize Fuzhou. The bandits used the false 19th and 20th Divisions as the vanguard. After occupying Jinxi, they advanced to the vicinity of Fengshanbu, south of Xuwan, on the 10th. It was found that Xuwan was an important town on the border between Qianchuan and Jinxi, only forty li from Fuzhou. The National Army had long placed heavy troops here to block them. When the bandits attacked Fengshanbu, they were defeated by the National Army. Unexpectedly, the bandits received reinforcements on the 12th and counterattacked Xuwan extremely fiercely. The National Army, the Song Xilian's troops dispatched from Fuzhou, fought a bloody battle with the bandits near Xuwan. The flames of war filled the sky, and stray bullets rained down. At that time, the bandits were trying to enter Fuzhou in one fell swoop. Just then, Commander-in-Chief Gu had telegraphed and transferred Xing Zhendong's southern troops from Guixi to Jinxi to attack the bandits' rear and reinforce Xuwan. Division Commander Xing led about three regiments of troops, advancing towards Xuwan via Langju, taking a pincer-like formation with Song's division. At about 1:00 PM on the 12th, Division Commander Xing arrived near Daxiangling in Wugang, south of Xuwan, and built a simple fortification there for cover. At 3:00 PM, he attacked the bandits on Daxuling, but because the bandits had already built fortifications on the ridge, several attacks were unsuccessful, so he temporarily took a defensive posture, confronting the bandits on Daxiangling. However, when the false 19th and 20th Divisions attacked Xuwan, Zhu De and Mao Zedong believed that the National Army would definitely have troops bypassing their rear to reinforce Xuwan, so they pre-emptively ambushed the false 4th, 5th, 6th Divisions, and the New Third Division near Langju. When Division Commander Xing opened Xuwan, they secretly followed behind. Starting at 7:00 PM, the false 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions began to attack the rear of Division Commander Xing, taking a encircling formation with the false 19th and 20th Divisions. Division Commander Xing was surrounded on all sides in the dark night, but he calmly responded to the battle, standing firm as a mountain. The bandits used close-order formations of platoons and companies to launch fierce attacks, no less than ten times. Division Commander Xing waited until they were close, then opened fire with machine guns, grenades, and rifles, as dense as a string of firecrackers. The bandits fell one after another, like moths to a flame. The corpses in front of the battle formed a meat wall and corpse垒, reaching higher than people. By the morning of the 13th, National Army planes arrived in groups and bombed the bandits fiercely. At that time, the National Army soldiers were even more invigorated and finally repelled the surrounding bandits. The remnants of the false 19th, 4th, 5th, 6th, and Newly Compiled Third Divisions retreated in separate routes towards Liuligang, Langju, and Zixi. According to the telegraph from the headquarters of the Northern Route Army, more than 4,000 bandits were killed in this battle, and more than 800 guns, as well as more than 100 flower machine guns and automatic guns, were captured. Yesterday, someone from Fuzhou said that the battle of Xuwan was indeed extremely fierce, and corpses can still be seen everywhere, constantly catching the eye. Many villages near Xuwan were burned by the bandits, and the houses in Xuwan Town were also damaged, with smoke, dust, tiles, and rubble creating an extremely tragic scene. At this moment, the bandits have retreated to the east of Jinxi and Zixi.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi various circles Association for Allied Bandit Suppression, considering that Song and Xing's divisions risked their lives to kill the enemy and broke the general psychology of fearing bandits, which is of great importance to the future of bandit suppression, specially spent 10,000 yuan yesterday to rush to Fuzhou to reward the troops.

<h3>Sichuan Army Encirclement and Suppression of the Xu Bandits - Wang and Fan's Troops Advance Northward - Tian and Deng Discuss and Decide on Troop Deployment Routes - Supervising Commissioners Assist in Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Hankou correspondence: The bandit suppression military affairs in Sichuan have been hampered by the inability of various armies to agree on a unified approach, resulting in the growth of bandit power. The bandits occupy the dangerous terrain of the Bashan Mountains and control the source of the Jiaqu River. More than a dozen counties in northern Sichuan have either been swallowed whole or nibbled away. After the fall of Suiding, the situation has become even more serious. Liu Xiang then sent his direct line troops, led by Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng, to attack from Liang Kai. Wang and Fan had participated in bandit suppression in western Hubei and had considerable experience. After departing, they engaged in fierce battles with the main force of the Xu bandits between Suiding and Kaijiang, at Mug铺, Pujia Chang, Fenghuang Mountain, Caojiezhe, Sanhuikou, Baibaizi, Huilong Chang, Yongxing Chang, Sanqingsi, Baoding Zhai, Changliuye, Jigongliang, Jiaxi Bridge, and Cutongpu. They repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits. The bandits, unable to advance eastward, abandoned Suijing and guarded the Luojiang Estuary, which is a key passage between Sui and Xuan, with all their strength. Liu Xiang, seeing that the advance and suppression by these two troops was going smoothly, ordered them to continue advancing northward to recover Xuanhan. He also urged the four routes of Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, Tian Songyao, and Deng Xihou to advance separately according to the predetermined plan, and used Tang Shizun's troops as the general reserve force, preparing for a major mobilization. Currently, the vanguards of Wang and Fan have reached the Luojiang Estuary and are continuing to fight a bloody battle with the bandits. The headquarters of the five routes has moved from Liangshan to Kaijiang. The troops stationed in Liang Kai have all moved forward. The two routes of Yang Sen and Li Qixiang attacked from Quxian and Yingshan. Liu Cunhou's remnants, after being reorganized by Liu Bangjun, are also awaiting orders to assist in the suppression. As for Tian Songyao and Deng Xihou's two routes, they are responsible for the western side. Tian's troops still guard the left bank of the Jialing River, and Deng's troops have crossed Zitong. Tian and Deng recently met in Huluxi and have decided on the troop deployment routes. After Deng's troops are concentrated in Zhaohua, they will jointly develop eastward. In view of the above situation, the encirclement by various armies is imminent. However, there is still cause for concern. The bandits' military strategy has always been to avoid the strong and attack the weak. The strengths and weaknesses of the various armies are already well understood, so future surprise attacks to the east and west will be even more unpredictable in their intentions. Among the various armies, except for Wang and Fan's two routes, which are advancing victoriously, Yang Sen and others have suffered repeated setbacks and have long feared the bandits like tigers. If they are taken advantage of, the entire military operation will inevitably suffer a setback. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is extremely concerned about the communist disaster in Sichuan. He recently sent Yang Deyuan, Chen Xingya, Yu Kedong, Wang Xiangting, Lei Biao, Li Anzhi, Li Leifu, and other seven people as Sichuan Bandit Suppression Supervising Commissioners to assist Liu Xiang in handling the military affairs of the advance and suppression. Yang and others arrived in Hankou on the 15th, and because they received a telegram order from Chairman Chiang, when they arrived in Hankou, they should first request instructions from He Chengjun, the Pacification Director stationed in Hubei, before entering Sichuan. He Chengjun had gone to Jiangxi, causing a conflict, and they plan to wait for He to return to Hankou before setting off westward. As for the central government sending troops to Sichuan, it is heard that there was such a proposal long ago, and there was talk of transferring a certain unit there. It is recently rumored that Yang Hucheng's troops will open up northern Sichuan, which should be realized. In addition, when the various armies in Sichuan heard that the central government was sending personnel to assist in the suppression, their morale was greatly boosted. (17th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Requests Rescission of Tan Changkai's Disciplinary Action; Pingdian Bureau Requests Reconsideration from the Capital; Otherwise, Telegraph Approval for Delayed Execution</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Tan Changkai initially served as a member of the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters. Because he devoted himself to He Jian's party affairs effectively, He recommended him to the Central Government, who appointed him as a member of the Hunan Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Construction Bureau, making him prominent for a time. However, this also laid the foundation for his misfortune. Because Hunan party affairs were deeply affected by the tide of factionalism, Tan became incompatible with the opposing faction. It is said that Tan was initially ordered by the Central Government to withdraw from the Provincial Party Headquarters, and then dismissed from his concurrent position as the Director of the Construction Bureau, all related to factional struggles. Recently, the National Government's Committee for the Discipline of Political Officials issued Judgment No. 10, "Tan Changkai is dismissed from his post and barred from holding office for ten years." Thus, Tan's only remaining position as a member of the Provincial Government was also removed, completely destroying Tan's political life. He Jian, considering Tan as someone who had worked hard for him, specially telegraphed Chairman Lin and President Wang from the Pingxiang Military Camp, requesting the rescission of the case of disciplining Tan, or requesting a delay in execution to allow for appeal. He also ordered Tan Changkai himself to go to the capital to defend himself within a specified time. He's telegram read as follows: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government and President Wang of the Executive Yuan, for your review, member of the Provincial Government Tan Changkai, during his tenure as Director of the Construction Bureau, was impeached for selling sulfur ore. After deliberation by the Committee for the Discipline of Political Officials, a disciplinary action was decided. However, upon investigation of the reasons cited in the decision, in terms of the law, the power to reserve and prohibit exploration and mining as stipulated by the Mining Law is a central authority. However, the Central Government has not issued any orders to the Bureau. Moreover, the Provincial Government had consulted the Ministry of Finance regarding the strict prohibition of exports of various military-related minerals, and the Ministry of Finance replied that the opinions of the Ministry of Military Administration advocated detailed research, while the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that an absolute prohibition on exports would inevitably have a significant impact on the mining industry, and should continue to be handled as before, except that after the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has a reliable method of maintaining the mining industry, it will be re-evaluated before the prohibition is implemented. Furthermore, in terms of the facts, the official did not directly or indirectly sell ore to aid the enemy during his tenure in the Construction Bureau. As for issuing shipping manifests, it was for the convenience of the Central Government in collecting mineral taxes, which has not been stopped to this day. The situation in other provinces is also the same. Moreover, the official stated in detail in his petition to the Disciplinary Committee, but it was not considered, and a severe penalty was hastily imposed, which seems unfair. In addition to the official's appeal, I respectfully request that it be submitted for reconsideration, rescinding the disciplinary action, or otherwise, please approve a delay in execution to allow for appeal and to demonstrate justice. Respectfully, He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government."</p>
<h3>He Jingcheng in Western Hunan Colludes with Border Bandits and Makes Disturbances; Declares Himself Commander of the "All-People National Salvation Army of the Republic of China"; Occupies Jingzhou and Suining Areas, Changes to the Five-Colored Flag</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Yuanjiang, Jingzhou, and Hongjiang areas of western Hunan were occupied by Chen Wo, Liao Xiangyun, Yan Zhongru, etc., in May of this year. He Jian dispatched three brigades of troops or more, including those of Chen Zixian, Li Guojun, and Xie Long, to defeat them. He Jian then appointed Li Jue, the commander of the 19th Division, as the commander of the Fourth Security Zone, stationed in Hongjiang. He also appointed Peng Zhuo as the Director of the Xiangxi Rehabilitation Office, intending to use military force to advance politics and ensure that the Provincial Government's policies reached the counties of Yuanjiang and Jingzhou. Unexpectedly, before the Rehabilitation Office was established, He Jingcheng, the commander of the First Regiment of the Fourth Security Zone, led his troops, composed of Xiangxi natives from the Gelaohui secret society, in a disturbance. He had been recruited and incorporated as a regimental commander by He Jian. Recently, He Jian ordered He's troops to go to Pingli and Liuyang to suppress bandits, but He was uneasy, and his troops were unwilling to leave their base. Therefore, he openly colluded with border bandits from Hunan and Guizhou, occupying the Jing County and Suining area, calling themselves the "All-People National Salvation Army of the Republic of China", changing to the Five-Colored Flag, and promoting Yu Yizhong as the commander-in-chief, He Jingcheng as the commander of the First Division, someone (name unknown) as the commander of the Second Division, and Lu Xin (who once served as the commander of bandit suppression in the Hunan-Guizhou border area) as the commander of the Third Division. They also declared that they would attack Hongjiang. It is said that Chen Wo, Liao Xiangyun, Yan Zhongru, etc., who are lurking on the Guizhou border, will also make a comeback and cooperate with He, etc. The intentions of the so-called All-People National Salvation Army are still unclear to the province. However, most of the provincial army has already gone to Jiangxi to suppress bandits, and cannot be transferred to western Hunan at present. Therefore, they have only instructed Chen Zixian, etc., to temporarily take a defensive position and stay in Hongjiang to observe the situation. It seems that the Xiangxi area is again in trouble.

<h3>Liu Zhi Tours Northern Henan; First Goes to Hua County to Inspect the Flood; Then Goes to the Wu'an and She County Area</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Liu Zhi originally planned to tour the Wu'an and She County areas on the morning of the 14th to inspect the administration of officials. Therefore, he appointed his entourage and prepared to depart on the 13th. Unexpectedly, the north wind was harsh, and the drizzle was misty, and it did not stop until late at night. He then decided to depart after the rain cleared and the sky cleared, and sent letters to the Henan Civil News and the Republic Daily to disclose the news of the rescheduled tour. This morning, the weather was quite good. Mr. Liu, accompanied by Secretary Li Zhenfeng, staff member Xue Shirong of the First Section, staff member Zhang Faquan of the Second Section, staff member Wang Tingkai of the Third Section, staff member Wang Yimin of the Fourth Section, and more than twenty other people, took a special train to Zhengzhou around 8:00 am, then transferred to the Pinghan Railway to northern Henan. He first went to Hua County to inspect the flood, and then went to the Wu'an and She County area to inspect the administration of officials. He is expected to return to Bian in about a week.

<h3>Financial Panic in Xuzhou; Paper Money of Various Private Banks Experiences Runs; County Government Clears Paper Money of Various Private Banks</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the simultaneous runs on the paper money of seven private banks, including Xu Bu's Gongyu, began on the 11th, a huge wave has been stirred up in Xuzhou's financial circles. Up to now, for a week, the market is still in a state of panic. Even the towns closer to Xuzhou have been affected. Because private paper money has no guarantee and no reserve fund, business has been sluggish and finance has been tight in recent years. Although the various private banks have some real estate, it is difficult to mortgage for cash. Moreover, the assets of each individual are not enough to offset the amount of paper money they have issued. Therefore, although the county government presides over maintaining the status quo on the one hand and thoroughly clearing on the other, it is ultimately unable to take effective measures due to insufficient credit and lack of cash. Those who run continue to run, and those who refuse to use it refuse to use it. The panic in the market remains the same. According to the amount of paper money and the amount of property reported by the various private banks, Gongyu has issued 700,000 strings of cash, with real estate on Yinshi Street worth 20,000 yuan and accounts receivable worth 40,000 yuan. At a rate of five strings per silver yuan, the equivalent of 140,000 yuan was issued, while the real estate and accounts receivable can only offset 60,000 yuan. Because it is a shareholder business, manager Zhang Shaozhi cannot maintain it. The county government convened a meeting of shareholders yesterday, but there were no results. It is now planned to have the shareholders guarantee and borrow money from the bank to clear the debt. However, at this time of extreme financial crisis, the bank also does not have so much money to use. As for the other companies, the manager of Chuanquan Store, Zhang Zuiping, has issued 500,000 strings of cash, with property consisting of land in Yuzhuang and Gushan, totaling 20 hectares, valued at 80,000 yuan, but only 10 hectares are held by the title, accounts receivable of 40,000 yuan, and only 3,000 yuan in cash. The manager of Shixingchang Store, Zhang Jingxiu, has issued 250,000 strings of cash, with real estate in Zhou Dong Lane worth 4,000 yuan, 3.9 hectares of land worth 34,000 yuan, accounts receivable of 20,000 yuan, and only 4,000 yuan in cash. The owner of Tianbaoyu Store, Zhao Bangqing, has issued 200,000 strings of cash, with real estate and land worth a total of 34,000 yuan, and accounts receivable of 20,000 yuan. The owner of Buxinji Store, Bu Zhiping, has issued 170,000 strings of cash, with real estate on Daoping Road worth 10,000 yuan, on Fushui Well worth 12,000 yuan, and on Bazi Street worth 20,000 yuan, and only 3,000 yuan in cash. The owner of Juhechang Store, Wang Fuqing, has issued 160,000 strings of cash, with real estate in Ma Hao Town worth 3,000 yuan, 1.5 hectares of land worth 9,000 yuan, an educational loan of 800 yuan, goods worth 4,000 yuan, and accounts receivable of 20,000 yuan. The owner of Yizhenxiang Store, Ding Yinzhou, has issued 100,000 strings of cash, with three mu of real estate land belonging to the Longhai Road, with ten buildings and seventy-two flat houses, with a construction cost of 21,000 yuan, of which a part has been used to guarantee credit for 1,700 yuan, and the accounts receivable are not detailed on a separate sheet. According to this, the amount of paper money and property reported by the various private banks can be offset, but the value of the property varies greatly, and a discount must be applied for mortgage, so the actual calculation is still not enough.</p>
<p>In recent days, in addition to the paper money panic in the local area, nearby areas have also reported alarms at the same time. For example, in Huangkou, the seven private currencies of Shaoyou Gongyu, etc., amount to as much as 150,000 yuan. Huangkou is demanding that the Commissioner's Office of the 12th District order the various private banks to bring money to Huangkou to redeem them, but the local area is still unable to maintain them, let alone have the capacity to reach the outer areas. Moreover, most of the banknotes issued by the various banks are used to purchase agricultural products for the purpose of transporting and mortgaging cash, resulting in even more banknotes being stored in the countryside. If they are fundamentally bankrupt, social order will be in jeopardy. County Magistrate She is using the assets of each company to negotiate with the banking sector to offset cash, ordering them to clean up separately, and is planning to convene a county consolidation committee, district office, chamber of commerce, and money industry association to organize a committee to clean up private banknotes to seek a thorough resolution. The County Consolidation Committee also convened various agencies and groups yesterday to discuss solutions, and decided to telegraph the province to send a commissioner to Xuzhou to thoroughly supervise the cleanup to eliminate the harm of banknotes. It is hoped that the disaster of Xuzhou banknotes can be cleared. However, the market is currently sluggish, the rural areas are bankrupt, and ordinary poor farmers do not have small businesses to operate, and most of them have unredeemable banknotes that cannot be circulated. If they cannot be redeemed in the future, the losers will be ordinary people, which is worrying. The crowded scene at the public exchange is mostly controlled by gangsters, who redeem them at a discount. Redeem one yuan of cash and only recover nine cents. Village women and children come to the city after running dozens of miles, and all return with tears, which is really sad to see. Those responsible should design more for these poor people. At this critical time of collapse of Xuzhou banknotes, the current maintenance and thorough cleanup must be considered together, aiming at stabilizing the current society and permanently eliminating future disasters. It is also the entire social problem of Xuzhou, which the people expect. (November 17)</p>

<h3>Streamlining and Merging of Provincial Water Police</h3>
<p>In order to reorganize the provincial water police, Commissioner Gu of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Office plans to merge the six districts in the province into three districts, and the ten detachments into four detachments, and eliminate one-third of the old and weak police officers. The Wu County Commercial, Agricultural and Educational organizations, considering that this is during the winter defense period, have sent telegrams to the provincial office, requesting a delay in the merger. In addition, Wei Zhanyuan, the District Chief of the Third Water Police District, was summoned to the province by Commissioner Gu yesterday to discuss the streamlining and merger matters. As for the issuance of back pay, the province is planning and hopes to issue it soon.</p>

<h3>Robbers of the Gonghe Pawnshop Arrested</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 am on the 17th, the Gonghe Pawnshop in Zhengyi Town was suddenly entered by eight or nine bandits who dug a hole. After deceiving the pawnshop clerk into a room, they searched and robbed for about an hour before escaping with the loot, estimated to be more than 1,000 yuan in cash and jewelry. After receiving the report, Hua Shijun, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, immediately ordered Patrol Officer Dai Yuheng to lead the police to guard the Su-Kun Highway. At the same time, he cooperated with Police Captain Luo Qixiang to supervise the police detectives to pursue the escaped bandits by both land and water routes. At 5:30 am, Patrol Officer Dai arrested two bandits, Zhang Yunsheng and Zhang Gansheng, on the Su-Kun Road, and seized a gold ingot, a watch, and 130 yuan in cash on the spot. He immediately escorted them to the bureau for interrogation. The two criminals confessed that they committed the robbery of the Gonghe Pawnshop with Chen A San and Wang A Er. Director Hua immediately prepared a document to transfer them to the county government for legal action.</p>

<h3>Two Robberies in One Night</h3>
<p>In Shaotian, Beixiang, Penglai Town, which belongs to the county, there are about 30 households, all of whom are farmers. The Qian and Yu families are relatively well-off, which has been coveted by bandits. At midnight the day before yesterday, when all the villagers were sound asleep, six or seven robbers suddenly came. They first went to the Qian family, broke down the gate, and broke into the bedroom, searching and robbing clothes and jewelry worth dozens of silver dollars. Then they went to the Yu family to rob, driving the family members into a room, tying them up with ropes, and rummaging through boxes and cabinets, robbing and leaving the land deeds and house receipts. There was no loss of clothes or jewelry. Before leaving, they took away five dan of white rice before leaving.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle between Police and Bandits in Shuangfeng Laoya</h3>
<p>The Fourth Water Police District, considering the importance of the defense of Liuhou River, ordered the First Squad of the 16th Brigade under its jurisdiction to be stationed there. Among them, eight police soldiers deserted with weapons last month, joined the bandits, and hid in Shuangfeng Laoya Jiang. Huang, the commander of the Liuhou Security Corps, got a tip the day before yesterday and secretly dispatched three experienced members, Zhou Pin San, Xie De Rong, and Chen Fengqi, with the tipster, to Shaxi. They met with the First Squad of the Fifth Brigade of the First Water Police District. Captain Li Zhigui sent a patrol boat, along with detectives Wang Guozhi and Li Lixiang, to sail to Zhitang to land. They disguised themselves as bandits and, led by the tipster, walked to Zhaojiazhai in Shuangfeng Laoya Jiang, where they pretended to be merchants to do business with the bandits. The bandits sent out two small boats. When the tipster gave a secret signal, the police rushed forward. The two sides exchanged dozens of gunshots, resulting in the capture of four bandits, Wang Zhu San, Yu Cao Qing, Wu Zhi Yuan, and Wang Shi Hong, with the rest escaping. Two rifles and more than 100 rounds of ammunition were seized. The captured bandits were sent to the First Unit for custody. After reporting back to the Corps, they will go to meet and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Misconduct Discovered in Bail of Criminals</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Prison Improvement Association held its eighth committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Yan Shenyu discussed the following matters: 1. Commissioners Xu Tigan and Zhou Erkai sent a letter stating that there was no Wang Zhenkun in the case of bailing out 36 people, including Huang Ziyu, etc. It is now found that the former prison officer Han reported that the name of the criminal was added to the list of previously bailed criminals. What is the situation? The resolution was to request an investigation into the case. The resolution was that the former prison officer Han added the name of Wang Zhenkun to the list when applying for bail after it had been reviewed. Whether there was any wrongdoing in it should be handed over to the Procuratorate of the County Court for investigation, and a report should be made to the High Court. 2. Commissioner Kong Xian proposed to ask the County Court to temporarily keep prisoners sentenced to short-term detention and those fined for less than one month in the prison for execution in order to facilitate the process. The resolution was to transfer the matter to the Procuratorate of the County Court for review. 3. Commissioner Xu Tigan proposed that the county raised funds to build a prison. How much did the former prison officer Han collect, and how should it be handled since it has not been clearly transferred after handing over the office? The resolution was to urge the former prison officer to quickly transfer the collected donations and the donation booklet. 4. Commissioners Xu and Zhou proposed to take turns sending people to inspect the prison in order to improve it. The resolution was to recommend Commissioner Sun Qing and Commissioner Cheng Jingtang to inspect and submit a written report at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Garment Industry Announces Another Strike</h3>
<p>The garment industry in Wuxi filed a petition with the county government to ban the establishment of new garment departments by various silk shops, which encroached on their business, and jointly petitioned the county party headquarters. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the county government approved the garment industry a few days ago, stating that the establishment of new garment departments by the silk and satin industry is a matter of business freedom, and the requested ban is difficult to approve. After receiving the approval, the industry was dissatisfied and convened more than 1,000 garment industry workers from inside and outside the city, departing from the guild hall in Shipi Lane to petition the county government. More than a dozen representatives from each district were elected to meet with the county magistrate. County Magistrate Yan sent staff member Zhou Shaoji to receive them and verbally instructed the representatives that the case had been approved and that they should rest assured that they would not act rashly. The representatives did not get what they wanted and withdrew together. However, the members' intentions were extremely firm, and they would not give up until they achieved their goals. Therefore, from the afternoon of the day before yesterday, some garment shops automatically went on strike. From the morning of yesterday (the 18th), more than 1,000 garment shops in the county went on strike to show their determination. At 2:00 pm, Qian Zhanhong, chairman of the Garment Industry Association, invited the heads of the new garment departments of silk and satin shops such as Shitaishing, Shihe, Rixin, Maolun, Jiusheng, and Xieshengyong to the association to negotiate a solution. However, the silk industry believed that the establishment of new garment departments was originally for the purpose of developing business and had nothing to do with the garment industry's business, so it was inconvenient to discuss. The garment industry also submitted a petition to the county chamber of commerce to provide relief and to quickly forward a letter to the silk and cloth industry to convene a meeting with the new garment departments to persuade them not to make Chinese clothing in order to avoid causing opinions among more than 3,000 garment workers. After the petition was sent, there has been no indication so far. A large number of workers are gathered in the association, holding meetings repeatedly, but some workers have different opinions, causing noise and causing small disputes among colleagues. The purpose of the workers' demands in this strike is only to change the name of the new garment department to the Western garment department, and the strike can be resolved. It is also heard that if the silk and satin industry does not make some concessions, the garment industry workers will take further measures to deal with it. One or two hundred people will be assigned to each silk shop to sit and eat to observe the situation, which is quite determined. The strike may expand.</p>

<h3>Provincial Party Headquarters Sends a Commissioner to Investigate the Suicide Case</h3>
<p>Lin You'e, the accountant of the Lihua Cotton Weaving Factory in Wu Yi, was detained by the Public Security Bureau for the Anti-Japanese Association's case of hatred for yarn. After Lin hanged himself in custody, the Provincial Party Headquarters, upon receiving the report, specially sent Commissioner Duan Benzhen to Changzhou to investigate. Duan first went to the Public Security Bureau, where he was received by Section Chief Si Daoping, who reported on Lin You'e's detention and suicide. Commissioner Duan resigned and then went to the Procuratorate of the County Court to investigate, where he was received by Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi. In the evening, he met with Lin's family and the managers of the Lihua Factory, Liu Dacai and Yang Shaozhen, at the Dacheng Hotel. On the 16th, Duan left Changzhou to return to the province to report.</p>

<h3>Cook Steals Huge Amount of Money for Buying Grain</h3>
<p>On the 17th, Zheng Dayuan, a grain trading firm in Sanhe, had a customer from Zhenjiang, Xiao Huanan, who brought thousands of yuan to the firm to purchase various grains on his behalf. Unexpectedly, around 1:00 am that night, more than 2,000 yuan of the money Xiao had brought was stolen. Upon inquiry, it was found that it was stolen by the cook Yu Xiao Caizi. Traces of Yu were immediately traced, but he had already fled without a trace. The owner of the firm is closely investigating Yu's whereabouts and has reported to the Public Security Bureau for assistance.</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Cessation of Yutong's Move Northward</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce, Agricultural Association, Education Association, Lawyers Association, and Newspaper Reporters Association stated that on the 3rd of this month, Shen Xin and other newspapers published that Jinan Yutong Company was moving north to Chenjiagang, and Envoy Miao Qiujie of Yun arrived in Yangzhou. In talks with various sectors of society, he denied the company's move north, saying that it was a misunderstanding that the company's shareholders had set up an office in Chengang. They specially jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Administration, and the Provincial Government, requesting an immediate cessation. The original telegram roughly said that Yangzhou is centered on the salt industry, and the salt industry is based on the seven companies in Jinan. Education, charity, public security, public welfare, and the employees of Twelve Market depend on it directly or indirectly for their livelihood, totaling more than one million people. The newspaper reported that a small number of shareholders of Yutong Company in Jinan held a meeting in Banpu to discuss moving to Chengang. If the other six companies follow suit, all those who rely on it for their livelihood will lose their jobs, and the local security is too important. We urge you to forward the telegram to Envoy Miao of Huaibei and Deputy Transport Envoy Zhou of Huainan, strictly ordering them to stop it in order to maintain the livelihood and security of the people.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the Chenqiao Town Robbery</h3>
<p>The robbery of Chenqiao Town and the seizure of weapons from the security corps is a major case. The district corps has arrested six key bandits, including Miao Wensui, and escorted them to the county government for interrogation. Their confessions are cunning. Magistrate Cheng believes that it is necessary to personally investigate, so he went to the town on the 17th with Peng Longxiang, the director of the county security corps, and expressed his condolences to the victimized merchants and residents. They also convened a meeting to discuss relief to military, government, and police agencies. In view of the rampant banditry, they divided the joint defense zone and scheduled a meeting on the 23rd at the Tongcheng Provincial Second Security Corps to discuss the methods of stationing guards.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Murder in Zhangqing Township</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 pm the day before yesterday, two people dressed in military uniforms suddenly came to the home of Zhao Huichen, a farmer at No. 22, Village 15, Dahuli, Section 5, Zhangqing Township, District 7, and entered to rob, holding a box gun and shooting Zhao Huichen to death. Afterwards, the Yangku Public Security Third Sub-bureau investigated and reported to the headquarters to transfer the county to hunt down the murderers. Magistrate Ruan received the report on the 16th and, as it is now in the winter defense period and rural theft cases are frequent, he strictly ordered his subordinates to strengthen precautions.</p>
<h3>Southeast Township School Refuses to Accept</h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, the director of the Department of Education, proposed at the 606th Provincial Government Meeting to concentrate educational property. It was decided that the Department of Education would take over the property of the Southeast and West Townships, and instructed the County Bureau to take over the matter and report it. The Department of Education sent Inspector Hu Chaolun and Chief of General Affairs Qu Yong'e to go to the Southeast Township School on the morning of the 20th to take over. The school specially scheduled a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at 2:00 pm to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that they completely refused to take over the matter and should argue according to reason and file an appeal with the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>Fire in Qinglong Lane Injures One Person</h3>
<p>The home of a silversmith at No. 4, Qinglong Lane, in the west gate of the town, suddenly caught fire at 7:00 am on the 17th. Because it was still early, it was not noticed at first. It was not until the fire penetrated the roof that passers-by shouted for help. However, the northeast wind was very strong that day. After a while, it spread to the four or five households of the Li family, the Wang family, the Zhou family, and the Gu family on the right and left. After about half an hour, the fire was extinguished by the various fire brigades. This time, six houses and eleven rooms were destroyed, with losses estimated at more than 5,000 yuan. A nearby wealthy household, Zhou Bairen's family, was grateful to the fire brigades for their effective efforts and was not affected. He specially hosted dozens of banquets in the evening to thank the firefighters for their efforts. After the fire, Zhao, a silversmith who lived in the Li Wang Gong Ye Silver Shop, went to watch, but suddenly the dangerous burden collapsed, and Zhao could not avoid it, resulting in serious injuries. He was sent to a trauma clinic in Nanmen for treatment.</p>

<h3>Four Robberies in One Night</h3>
<p>Bao, a farmer in Hongjia Village, Model Town, Waijiuliwan in the west, is semi-farming and semi-studying, and his family is well-off. Yesterday midnight, more than 40 bandits suddenly came, carrying three bandit ships, and carrying quick guns. They broke down the door and entered the room to rob. They were robbed of 30 dan of white rice and 200 silver yuan. The Zhang and Lu families next door were also affected, and a total of 25 dan of brown rice and other miscellaneous clothes and ornaments were robbed. At the same time, the home of Lao Shanggui, a farmer in Hongdong Port, Qianyao Town, was also robbed of more than 100 yuan of clothes and cash.</p>
<h3>County Representatives Request Reorganization of the Bureau of Finance</h3>
<p>The County Party Headquarters convened the 14th County Representatives' Conference. The conference stated that the Bureaus of Finance in the provinces and counties were originally the Departments of Finance in the County Governments. During the era of setting up departments, all expenses were paid from the county's administrative expenses. Since the establishment of the Bureau of Finance, the number of staff has increased several times, and the expenses have also increased accordingly. As for this county, in addition to the director, there are also three section chiefs, three clerks, and two secretaries. The expenses have increased from more than 200 yuan to 800 yuan. After the establishment of the Business Tax Bureau, the tooth post tax and slaughter tax, which were originally managed by the Bureau of Finance, were transferred to the Business Tax Bureau. The affairs are simpler than before, but the number of staff is more than before. The contradiction of facts is such that the central government, because the financial situation of Zhejiang Province is difficult, ordered the provincial government that all financial affairs of the Bureau of Finance should still be handled by the County Government setting up a department. Moreover, at this time of serious national crisis and strict austerity, the province should be requested to abolish the Bureau of Finance to avoid wasting public funds. This proposal was passed by the entire body, and a request was immediately submitted to the Provincial Party Headquarters to forward it to the Provincial Government for review.</p>

<h3>The Rampant Banditry in the Southeastern Countryside</h3>
<p>Our county borders the sea and has always been known as an area with many bandits. Since the abolition of the four rural public security substations, small-time thieves have taken the opportunity to become more active. In the Huangsha area, just the other day, twelve families were robbed of all their cotton and clothing in one night. All were poor, small households. Last night, over twenty bandits, many carrying electric lights, passed through places like Xiaosha Road and Jiazhuang. They were immediately shot at and pursued by the public, and the bandits returned fire before leaving. Wealthy households nearby are unable to sleep soundly at night and are extremely alarmed.</p>
<p>Rugao</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Yuebo Township</h3>
<p>In Rugao Shuangdian District, the Gu family in Yuebo Township was suddenly broken into by many bandits on the night of the tenth. They entered the bedroom and fired several shots at the bed, luckily without injuring anyone. It is estimated that over three hundred silver dollars and several pieces of gold jewelry were robbed. The case has now been reported to the county for investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Female Doctor's Wife Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Kan Xunqing, a doctor in this county, has been practicing medicine for many years and has a small reputation. His family runs a Chinese medicine business, which is doing very well. His wife, Hu, is over forty years old and has a very peaceful nature. She assists with household affairs and keeps everything in good order. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around eight o'clock, for some unknown reason, she secretly swallowed an ounce of opium and committed suicide. She instructed her daughters-in-law to manage the household affairs well and avoid arguments. After speaking, she lay back on a rattan chair. Her family noticed something was wrong with her expression, and her husband and son tried to rescue her, but to no avail. She died at four o'clock in the afternoon. Her family is overwhelmed with grief, but the reason for her suicide remains unclear.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<h3>Tao Sijin Sent to Prison for Execution</h3>
<p>In the case of Tao Sijin, a female student at the West Lake Art Academy, who tragically murdered her classmate Liu Mengying, after the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial, the Zhejiang High Court sentenced her to life imprisonment and acquitted Xu Qinwen. The prosecutor considered the sentence in this case to be too lenient and appealed to the Supreme Court. However, due to the related Communist Party case involving Song Yuanming, both Xu and Tao were sentenced to five years in prison. Xu was dissatisfied and appealed, but Tao did not appeal. Yesterday (the 18th) at 10:00 AM, the criminal court ordered bailiffs to bring Tao from the Hangzhou County District Court Detention Center and escort her to the First Prison for execution. Tao looked haggard, with tears in her eyes. Her pitiful state was quite heartrending.</p>
<h3>Wang Ying's Embezzlement Case Appealed</h3>
<p>Wang Ying, the former magistrate of Jiaxing County, embezzled over 90,000 yuan in public funds during his tenure and went into hiding in Shanghai. He was arrested this spring and sent to the Hangzhou Court for trial, where he was sentenced to ten months for embezzlement and ordered to repay the embezzled funds. The prosecutor in this case believed that the sentence was too lenient and filed a public prosecution with the High Court. Yesterday (the 18th) at 3:00 PM, the Second Criminal Division of the High Court brought Wang in for questioning. He was already clear on the details of the case and will be sentenced after summoning witnesses.</p>
<p>Hefei</p>
<h3>Primary School Teachers Demand Salary</h3>
<p>The teachers and staff of Hefei's primary schools, due to the Education Bureau's significant salary arrears, have repeatedly requested payment without success. They formed a joint association of primary school teachers and staff and negotiated with Cheng Guangshou, the director of the Education Bureau, but to no effect. Director Cheng suddenly went to the provincial capital on the 13th for official business, and the head of the First Section, Lu Shaosan, was delegated to act in his place. The teachers and staff, upon hearing the news, all went to the bus station to demand their salaries from Cheng, nearly resulting in a clash. Cheng stated that Lu was responsible and left. The teachers and staff then went to the Education Bureau to find Lu, but he would not see them. That evening, they decided to strike and announced Cheng's crimes. County Magistrate Guo is currently mediating.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Kunshan County Government</h3>
<p>To the editor of your esteemed newspaper:</p>
<p>In the "Nanjing News" column of your newspaper on the 18th of this month, there was a report titled "Kunshan Civil Servant Disciplinary Case," which stated that "Kunshan County Magistrate Cheng Ruji violated the law and neglected his duties, and the Control Yuan transferred him to the Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action according to law." Upon investigation, the original reason for the case transferred by the Control Yuan was that County Magistrate Cheng had illegally harbored subordinates. In July of this year, County Magistrate Cheng submitted a written defense upon the order of the Disciplinary Committee. No disciplinary action has been taken. The newspaper report does not match the case. It concerns the personal reputation of County Magistrate Cheng. Therefore, we are sending the original reason for the case and the facts of the matter, requesting that your newspaper publish them to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Kunshan County Government, November 18th.</p>

<h3>The National Economic Council Held Its First Regular Meeting Yesterday; Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke Both Came to Shanghai to Attend; It Was Decided to Add Jiang and Kong as Standing Committee Members; Wang and Sun Spoke of the Fujian Disturbance, Believing It Would Not Become a Reality</h3>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai together yesterday morning by night train from Nanjing, at the invitation of Song Ziwen, to attend the first regular meeting of the Economic Council, to discuss all the ongoing work of the council, and decided to add Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Kong, Minister of Finance, as Standing Committee Members. Regarding the rumored political disturbance brewing in Fujian Province, Wang, Sun, and others all gave speeches, believing that this matter would not become a reality. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wang, Sun, and Others Arrive in Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke, at the invitation of Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the Economic Council, came to Shanghai to attend the first regular meeting of the Economic Council to discuss all ongoing work. Those who came to Shanghai with Wang and Sun yesterday morning included Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, and Secretary of the Legislative Yuan Ma Chaojun. They took the night express train from Nanjing together the night before at 11:00 PM. Wang, Zeng, and Chu got off the train at Nanxiang at 7:00 AM, while Sun Ke and Ma Chaojun got off at Zhenru at 7:15 AM. The others got off at the North Station. The Municipal Security Office specially dispatched two teams of soldiers yesterday morning, distributed in Zhenru and the North Station to maintain order.</p>
<h3>The Regular Meeting of the Economic Council Was Held Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council held its first regular meeting of the Standing Committee yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at its Shanghai office located at 1729 Avenue Joffre. The Standing Committee members who attended included Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, and Sun Ke. Those attending as observers included Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, and Secretary-General of the Economic Council Qin Fen. At the beginning of the meeting, Song reported on the one-year work plan drafted in Shanghai. Then, the organization of the council and the addition of Standing Committee members were discussed. It was decided to add two more Standing Committee members, and the candidates were already decided: Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance. It will be announced after being approved by the Central Political Council next Wednesday. The meeting lasted for three hours and adjourned at 12:40 PM. All the details of the meeting are scheduled to be officially announced at the office on Monday (tomorrow) at 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Discusses the Political Disturbance in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Wang told reporters from various newspapers after the meeting yesterday that this morning, the members of the Economic Council met to discuss the internal organization of the National Economic Council. The Secretary-General, Qin Fen, will be responsible for releasing information about this matter soon. As for the addition of two Standing Committee members, the candidates have been decided as Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance. It will be officially announced after being submitted to the Central Political Council for approval next Wednesday. Regarding the brewing of a new organization in Fujian Province, the current situation has gradually eased and is not as serious as the outside world has reported. It is expected that it will not become a reality. The central government believes that it is just a rumor, so it has not prepared to send personnel to mediate. However, if the rumors become a reality, the central government will use political methods to ensure that it is eliminated in its infancy. However, I deeply feel that the country has come to this point, and unity is even more insufficient to resist foreign aggression. How can we further disperse our strength? As for Mr. Hu Zhantang, he is still in Hong Kong, and the central government is eagerly hoping that he will come north to jointly discuss national affairs. Furthermore, the issues of opening traffic and mail in North China are currently not making any real progress. The Japanese side is hoping for negotiations to resolve the issue as soon as possible, but because of the significant impact, we will not proceed rashly without detailed research and consideration.</p>
<h3>Sun Zhesheng Talks About Hu Still Being in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter specially drove to visit President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke at his private residence to inquire about the truth of the political disturbance in Fujian Province and the mission of this visit. According to him, his purpose in coming to Shanghai today was to participate in the regular meeting of the National Economic Council to discuss all the ongoing work of the council. Regarding the brewing of a new organization in Fujian Province, the central government has not yet received a confirmed report. Even Chairman Lin of the National Government in Fujian has not heard of any movements. Furthermore, Mr. Hu Zhantang is currently indeed still in Hong Kong and has not gone to Fujian. However, the central government is eagerly hoping that Mr. Hu will come to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. As for the rumor that personnel will be sent to Hong Kong to mediate, it is absolutely not true. The situation in Fujian is still normal, and there is no movement, so there is no need to send personnel.</p>
<h3>Zeng and Chu Expressed That Cai and Others Telegraphed Chiang</h3>
<p>Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming told reporters yesterday that he came to Shanghai specifically to participate in the naming ceremony of the "Two Roads" aircraft. The news of the brewing of a new organization in Fujian Province should not be as serious as the outside world has reported. Moreover, Cai Tingkai and the others of the 19th Route Army have always had very harmonious feelings with the central committee members, so it is predicted that there will be no action. According to Chu Minyi, Chairman Jiang Guangnai of the Fujian Provincial Government and Commander Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army have already sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, explaining the situation in Fujian and praising Chen Mingshu, asking him to come to Nanjing to serve in the central government. Therefore, there are no problems. The 19th Route Army's resistance against Japan in Shanghai during the "January 28th Incident" has been praised worldwide, and all Chinese people take it as a special honor. If this time there is no careful consideration, and changes and internal turmoil occur, causing the local area to be devastated, then the past glory will be destroyed. It is believed that the intelligent and decisive generals of the 19th Route Army will not bear to do this.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Others Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, after completing their attendance at the economic conference, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, Vice Chief of Staff He Yaozu, also completed their participation in the naming ceremony of the "Two Roads" aircraft, and Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, etc., all took the night train to Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent an Important Telegram Yesterday, Affirming the Principle of Quieting the Interior and Pacifying the Exterior; It Is Necessary to Establish a Direction and Not Be Confused; Everyone Should Fulfill Their Duties and Practice What They Preach</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to rumors of unrest in the Fujian political situation, sent a general telegram, making its claims. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, all members of the Central Party Headquarters, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of Nanchang, all Commanders-in-Chief, Governors of each province, Party Headquarters of each province and city, and Municipal Governments, G鑑, The loss of four provinces and the fragmentation of Hebei, the disturbances in Sichuan and Jiangxi, and the swarming of bandits are all signs that it is easy to talk about quieting the interior and pacifying the exterior in this time of crisis, but difficult to implement. It is necessary to establish a direction and not be confused. The treachery of political winds and the use of inducement and coercion are the long-standing skills of the enemy. We should first recognize the advantages and disadvantages and not sacrifice the overall plan for the sake of local benefit, so that sovereignty can be secured and lost territories can be recovered. This is the principle of pacifying the exterior. When the country is in distress, discussing major plans can easily lead to disagreements. The idea of縱棧 often leads to opportunities for intervention. This is the source of political instability. We must introspect deeply and fulfill our duties in military, political, and other areas, practice what we preach, establish a framework, but first blame ourselves and not immediately blame others, so that unity does not become empty talk. This is the principle of quieting the interior. If we ignore this and do not seek improvement, the collapse and disintegration may be unavoidable. We dare to express our sincerity and follow Du Mu's example of offering words of reproach. We hope you will consider and accept them. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce,敬上.</p>

<h3>Special Trains Were Opened</h3>
<p>The "Two Roads" Administration specially opened special trains from the North Station to Xujiahui yesterday. The trains departed from the North Station at 11:55 AM and 1:15 PM.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Security</h3>
<p>The "Two Roads" Air Defense Fundraising Committee had previously sent a letter to the Security Office of the Garrison Headquarters, as well as various Boy Scout groups, to be responsible for maintaining order at the venue. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the road from Xujiahui to Hongqiao Airport was guarded by the Public Security Bureau. Around the airport, there were also security offices and airport troops stationed, armed with guns, scattering sentries, and providing strict protection. In addition to the Public Security Bureau's security team protecting the venue, the Boy Scout groups from Moore Hall, the Wu Yu Sports Association, the YMCA, the YMCA Middle School, the Yousheng Travel Group, and other groups also assisted in maintaining order.</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>At the entrance of the venue, a colorful archway was erected, with a white banner in the middle that read "Naming Ceremony of Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Aircraft." On the side of the venue, a podium was built, with a white banner in the center that also read "Naming Ceremony of Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Aircraft." On both sides were white banners with the couplet "Promoting aviation is the forerunner of saving the country from difficulty," and "Saving the country and resisting foreign aggression must promote the aviation industry." In the center of the stage was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, with party and national flags crossed on both sides. To the right of the stage, about ten feet away, was the municipal government military band. The surrounding area was surrounded by ropes to prevent the audience from entering, and the Boy Scouts assisted the military and police in maintaining order.</p>

After collective discussion by the public welfare committee of the "Two Roads" colleagues, it was decided to allocate the public welfare funds stored by the colleagues for the purchase of the aircraft. Contact was made with the China Aviation Construction Association, and one of the 18 aircraft ordered by the association was transferred. After today's ceremony, it will be presented to the government. We have two hopes: (1) that other railway colleagues will follow suit and donate as much as possible, and (2) that this aircraft will be used effectively for foreign defense in the future, and fight for the glory of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>After the presidium's report, Mayor Wu (Tiecheng), the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, gave a speech, stating that he was very honored to represent the Central Party Headquarters and participate in today's naming ceremony of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft. The colleagues of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo "Two Roads" have worked hard to donate and sacrifice all their savings to purchase this aircraft and donate it to the government. He deeply admired them. If the railway colleagues across the country can emulate the enthusiasm of the "Two Roads" colleagues and donate ten or twenty aircraft, it will not be difficult to resist foreign aggression. Then, Kong Xiangxi, the vice president of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, spoke, saying that today</p>

<p>is the naming ceremony of the "Two Roads" aircraft. The colleagues of the "Two Roads" have tried their best to donate aircraft to assist the government, and the central government is very pleased with this. I hope that all our compatriots across the country will rise up and enthusiastically donate to protect the territory of the Republic of China and increase the honor of our nation. Next, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming gave a speech, saying that our country has suffered huge losses since the January 28th Shanghai Incident. In the aftermath of the people's pain and anger, they have donated aircraft to help national defense. In our country, which lacks aviation, if we do not work hard to strengthen aviation, we cannot talk about resisting foreign aggression. If we want to resist foreign aggression, we should first help the government and donate aircraft to strengthen national defense. Then, He Yaozu, Chairman Chiang's representative, gave a speech, stating that he was ordered by Chairman Chiang to represent him in participating in today's naming ceremony. Mr. Chiang deeply admires the efforts of the "Two Roads" colleagues in donating aircraft, so he specially ordered his brother to come to Shanghai to represent him in participating. But now that we have donated aircraft, we must also pay attention to aviation talent. We must cultivate technical talent for flying, and secondly, we must pay attention to the construction of aviation to assist the power of the air force. Next, Chu Minyi, the representative of the Executive Yuan, gave a speech, stating that in the past, European and American countries used aircraft for transportation. Later, because aircraft could scout the enemy's defense areas and control the enemy, aviation became a powerful weapon for combat. Our country has suffered losses from foreigners because of this. Therefore, to save the country, we must equip ourselves with aircraft to resist foreign aggression. Now, the colleagues of the "Two Roads" have been able to save money and food to build this aircraft, which is what we admire. I hope that our compatriots will follow suit. Finally, Lin Kanghou of the National Aviation Construction Association gave a speech, saying that the Aviation Association is jointly organized by the people and the government. The meaning of its organization is nothing more than paying attention to national defense, paying attention to national defense, and paying attention to national defense because of careful life and protecting property. In this year, naming and donating aircraft to the government one, two, or three times in a row is to help the country build air defense. But I hope that the government will cherish the aircraft that were named and received, not just donated by the "Two Roads" colleagues, but also by the families of the "Two Roads" colleagues, as well as rickshaw pullers and maids. Therefore, after accepting the aircraft, I hope that it will not be used in internal wars, but will be effectively used against foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Handover Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft was painted entirely gray. The upper sides of both wings were painted with the blue sky and white sun national emblem, and the lower sides were painted with the words "Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo." The naming ceremony was held at 3:00 PM. First, Chairman Chen Chengshi handed over the aircraft certificate and read: "The country has the right to defend, and the people have the duty to donate. Now, we respectfully present the warplane Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, which was purchased by the Association through raising funds, to the government. To defend the country and protect the people, each must fulfill their responsibilities, and the Party and the country will have boundless grace. This is the certificate." After reading, he presented it to Wu Tiecheng, the representative of the Central Government. Then, Wu transferred it to Shen Dexie, the representative of the Aviation Administration. Wu then unfolded the National Government's commendation and read: "Now, the entire staff of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways raised funds to purchase the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft, which is beneficial to air defense. Their patriotism and enthusiasm are deeply commendable. A commendation is hereby issued to encourage them. This is the certificate." Chairman Lin Sen, Premier Wang Zhaoming of the Executive Yuan, November 18th, 22nd year of the Republic of China. After reading, he presented it to Chen Chengshi of the presidium.</p>
<h3>Naming and Ascension</h3>
<p>After the handover ceremony, it was already past 3:00 PM. Everyone rushed to the front of the aircraft to perform the naming ceremony. Yuan Boyang and others removed the Party and national flags from the nose of the aircraft, and then Ms. Tao Chun performed the ascension ceremony. She lightly tapped the nose of the aircraft with a rotating needle with champagne, and the wine splashed everywhere. Then,</p>
<h3>Nine Aircraft in Formation (Photo by Qi)</h3>
<p>students from the aviation school rolled their wheels and spiraled upwards. The other aircraft, including the Shanghai City, Shanghai Business, Shanghai Industry, Shanghai School, Shanghai Boy Scout, Ningbo, Zhejiang Save the Nation, and Whampoa No. 1 aircraft, also rose one after another and formed three teams to fly in circles.</p>
<h3>Technical Performances</h3>
<p>The pilots of the nine aircraft were instructors Liu Chao and Zhang Yuanbei from the Central Aviation School, and students Leng Peiji, Mao Yingchu, Huang Guanghan, Liu Cuigang, Hao Hongzao, Liang Yiquan, Zhang Xufu, and Li Guidan. First, they split into two small teams, and then one team split up, each flying to a height of 5,000 feet to perform amazing techniques such as straight dives and somersaults. At 3:50 PM, the Ningbo aircraft descended to refuel. The other eight aircraft flew to Hangzhou. After the Ningbo aircraft refueled, student Zhang Xufu of the aviation school piloted it upwards to perform in the high altitude, repeatedly making left, right, front, and rear flips five or six times, causing the spectators to be extremely shocked. Compared with the previous performances of Du Lide and Gao Zhihang, it was even more amazing. The audience in the arena cheered and applauded. Afterwards, two more training aircraft flew up and performed parachute jumps. At 4:30 PM, the Ningbo aircraft also returned to Hangzhou, because the aviation school does not take holidays on Sundays and still needs to practice flying as usual.</p>
<h3>Flying to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>After the "Two Roads" aircraft was named, it will return to Hangzhou with the aircraft sent by the Aviation Administration. It is scheduled to fly along the road to Nanjing today, and then fly along the road from Nanjing to Ningbo tomorrow. Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo "Two Roads" are preparing to hold welcomes in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and major stations to celebrate.</p>
<h3>After the News of the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations between the United States and Russia Reached Shanghai, the Russian Consul Expressed Joy; The American Minister Sailed South</h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening Post reported that when the news of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia reached Shanghai, the American Minister Johnson was about to set sail on the USS Augusta to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou. He will not return to Shanghai until the ninth of next month. The Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov is in Nanjing and will return to Shanghai in a few days. Therefore, the main diplomatic representatives of the two countries in Shanghai at this time are the American Consul General Cunningham and the Soviet Russian Consul General Svietchnik. Therefore, Cunningham and Svietchnik will pay formal visits to each other in early next week. It is estimated that Svietchnik will visit Cunningham first, perhaps as early as Monday, because Cunningham is the leader of the consular corps. In the future, when the American Minister Johnson returns north, he will also pay a visit to the Soviet Russian Ambassador. The location will likely be Shanghai or Nanjing. However, the American Minister has been stationed in China for a long time, while the Russian Ambassador has a higher position. Both are straightforward and unceremonious, so there should be no dispute over the order of precedence. This morning (18th), when reporters went to the Soviet Russian Consulate General, Consul General Svietchnik had a joyful expression and stated that he welcomed the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries with great joy and believed that the close friendship between the two great powers would have a great future. All loyal friends of peace will join.</p>
<h3>The Shipping Bureau's Three Special Envoys He, Wu, and Shi to Depart Overseas Tonight, Boarding the Ship</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) is undertaking the task of transporting American loan cotton and wheat. They are leasing American ships to transport these goods to Shanghai. Liu Hongsheng (劉鴻生) has specially appointed He Molin (何墨林), the head of the business department of the bureau, to board the Russian Empress (俄國皇后號) at midnight tonight. He will go directly to Vancouver, then to Portland, to liaise with the American business representatives already entrusted with the task of chartering ships and handling all formalities for loading in the United States. Yesterday, Mr. He handed over his duties within the bureau to Chen Daqing (陳達卿). His passport and other documents for traveling abroad were all completed in the afternoon, and he will board the ship tonight, scheduled to sail tomorrow morning. Furthermore, Wu Daming (伍大名), the first section chief of the Ministry of Communications' Navigation Administration Department, and Shi Gan (史幹), the bureau's navigation consultant, also received their passports at the same time. They will travel on the same Russian Empress as He Molin. However, after reaching Vancouver, Wu and Shi will take a train to Quebec and then board a transatlantic mail ship to London. These connecting tickets are being sold by Changxing (昌興), which is faster than going directly to England. When He, Wu, and Shi depart, they will take with them all important documents and contracts related to ship chartering, docks, shipbuilding, etc.</p>
<h3>Joint Shipping by the Shipping Bureau and Longhai Railway Begins; Tonghua Ship Sails to Haizhou This Afternoon; Announcement to All Circles Yesterday and Stipulation of Freight Rates at Each Station; Longhai Railway Bureau Announces Process of Handling Joint Shipping</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (國營招商局) is about to formally sign a contract to undertake a national sea-land joint transportation agreement. It is scheduled to be fully implemented on the first day of next month. The Longhai Railway (隴海鐵路) has decided to implement it earlier, tomorrow, and will announce the truth about the joint transportation, as well as the methods and freight rates. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Goods Accumulated Awaiting Shipment</h3>
<p>Over the past two days, Zhou Songnian (周頌年), the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau's Transportation Department, has repeatedly sent telegrams to Shanghai, stating that two large batches of joint transportation goods have arrived at the temporary pier at Lao Yao (老窰), one batch being 2,000 tons and the other being 1,000 tons, urgently awaiting loading for Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) urgently ordered the Tonghua (同華) ship to sail this afternoon to load the first batch of joint transportation goods to Shanghai and assigned the Yushun (遇順) ship to depart for Lao Yao on the 21st to rush the shipment of joint transportation goods to Shanghai. A reply telegram has been sent to Zhou Songnian for reference. The cargo line at the Jinliyuan (金利源) Wharf has also been prepared for the loading and unloading of incoming goods.</p>
<h3>Implementing Joint Transportation</h3>
<p>After the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) jointly manage sea-land transportation, they officially announced to all sectors of society yesterday: In order to seek benefits and convenience for agriculture and commerce, and reduce transportation costs, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (國營招商局) and the state-owned Longhai Railway (國有隴海鐵路) will jointly manage sea-land transportation, so that goods from Shanghai, Qingdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other coastal ports can directly reach Xuzhou, Lanfeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Tongguan, and other places along the Longhai Railway. Agricultural products along the Longhai Railway can also be directly transported to the coastal ports. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) has assigned the Tonghua (同華) ship to sail from Shanghai to Lao Yao (老窰), Haizhou, at 12:00 noon today, arrive at Lao Yao on the 20th, load the first batch of joint transportation goods, and return to Shanghai from Lao Yao on the 22nd, arriving in Shanghai on the 24th.

<h3>Announcement of the Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Longhai Railway Administration announced to the reporter of the New Sound News Agency the truth about the joint transportation between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局): Since the Ministry of Railways advocated cooperation between various routes and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) to jointly manage sea-land transportation and signed a contract, the Longhai Railway, in order to respond to environmental needs and facilitate the circulation of agricultural products along the route, first formulated methods in accordance with the contract terms and scheduled implementation. However, private shipping companies, fearing that the cargo of the route would be monopolized by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局), rose up in opposition. These situations have all been reported in the newspapers, thus arousing the attention of the general public. This kind of event is a major improvement in the transportation industry and has a great impact on the future of commercial economy and agricultural products, and it should have research value. What is the current situation of the junction of the Longhai sea and land, and is the cargo transportation of private shipping companies really hopeless? It is difficult to understand the truth without detailed investigation. (1) The Longhai Railway is the largest east-west trunk line in the country, running through northern Jiangsu, central Henan, and reaching Xi'an, Shaanxi, via Tongguan. In terms of transportation position, it seems to be as important as the Yangtze River. The sea-land junction station at its eastern end is called Dapou (大浦), located on the bank of the Linhong River (臨洪河), with a pier built to berth ships traveling between Shanghai and Qingdao to load goods for sea transport. There are still more than 40 miles of waterway, and due to tidal conditions, navigation is not very smooth. This is a temporary pier of the route, and several private shipping companies are recruiting cargo. Whenever cargo is unobstructed and goods are prosperous, Dapou’s goods cannot be exported quickly, resulting in delays, which has long been a disease for merchants. Therefore, Dapou is one of the Longhai's export channels, but it cannot be the only export channel of the Longhai. The route had already foreseen this, so it tried its best to operate the Lianyungang (連雲海港) seaport to supplement the shortage of Dapou and the needs of cargo transportation. After the completion of Lianyungang seaport in the future, Dapou pier can still be a side branch for export. The rumor that Dapou pier will be abandoned is ignorant of the facts and is not credible. (2) Dapou pier cannot export goods smoothly, and the official pier of Lao Yao (老窰) in Lianyungang seaport has a huge project and cannot be completed immediately. If no other way is sought, there will be a risk of blockage and congestion of agricultural products in Shaanxi, Gansu, southern Shanxi, western Henan, and Xuhai, which will greatly affect the rural economy and people's livelihoods in the above-mentioned areas. The Longhai Railway Bureau is wary of the importance of this matter, so it is building a temporary pier and warehouses at Sunjiashan (孫家山), about ten miles west of Lao Yao, and is carrying out joint transportation methods with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商進行聯運辦法) in accordance with the Ministry's order, so that it can separate from Dapou's shipping and run in parallel. The rumor that the Longhai and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) are jointly managing sea-land transportation at the Lao Yao pier is also ignorant of the local situation. At present, the Lao Yao pier is still in the stage of driving piles and filling the sea, so how can it stop ships and manage joint transportation? Anyone with common sense knows that this is a rumor. (3) Currently, thousands of tons of goods have been piled up at the Dapou pier and cannot be transported smoothly. The more goods that come, the more congested Dapou becomes. The joint transportation between the Longhai and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) is therefore imminent due to this need and is now ready to be implemented soon. Some people say that after the Sunjiashan (孫家山) starts joint transportation, Dapou will be affected, and even those related to shipping there will inevitably suffer losses. This is also a wrong observation. It should be known that there has always been competition in the shipping industry, both in China and abroad. The start of sea-land joint transportation in Sunjiashan (孫家山) and Dapou's shipping will create competition, which is the actual situation. However, it is too much to say that Dapou will be greatly affected, because the Dapou station is still open to traffic as usual, and the Dapou pier is also loading and unloading as usual. As long as the shipping companies there improve their methods and try to solicit business, why worry about not having goods to transport? Although the Longhai cooperates with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) due to contractual relations, the transportation of goods is still subject to the opinions of merchants. If merchants insist on transporting to Dapou and handing over to private shipping companies for shipment, the Longhai cannot force them to hand over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) for joint transportation. This is a clear principle. What is the loss? As for the current situation in Dapou, where there is too much cargo and it is difficult to ensure that the goods do not go to other routes, even without the competition from the temporary pier of Sunjiashan (孫家山), what is the benefit to Dapou? In short, the future of the Dapou pier depends on whether the shipping companies there have good methods. If they are well-managed and the water feet are low, even with joint transportation competition, there will be no impact.</p>
<h3>The North China Sino-Japanese Negotiations Reported by the Japanese Side are Opposed and Suspended by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the "China Press," (字林報) Japanese sources in this port state that Japanese Ambassador Arima (有吉) did not hold any negotiations with the Chinese authorities during his trip to Peiping, because if Arima had done so, China would have de facto recognized "Manchukuo". However, Huang Fu (黄郛) and Japanese Major General Okamura (岡村) did discuss unresolved Sino-Japanese issues under the guidance of the Japanese Ambassador, but they did so with special caution to ensure that the discussions did not go beyond the scope of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. Judging from the situation, it seems that Wang Jingwei's (汪精衛) agreement with the Japanese Ambassador to have Arima preside over political negotiations with the "Man" authorities was not implemented due to opposition from the Legislative Yuan. It is said that the two sides agreed on the following points: the general principles of transportation cooperation between China and the "Man" authorities; the "Man" authorities should set up a post office on the border, adjacent to the Chinese post office, and customs should follow this approach; the "Man" authorities should collect import and export duties on goods passing through customs; China should regard Manchuria as part of its territory and not collect export duties on goods entering Manchuria, but should collect taxes as if transporting goods from one province to another, and the same applies to import duties. The report concludes by saying that, according to Ota (大田) of the Japanese Embassy, China and the Japanese authorities (or Manchuria) will continue to discuss everything in detail, and important matters can be resolved through discussion. The so-called important matters probably refer to China's de facto recognition of "Manchukuo."</p>
<h3>The Money Trade Pledges to Borrow One Million from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency (大公社), the Shanghai Money Trade Association (上海錢業公會) held an extraordinary general meeting of all members at its association's premises at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 16th). Over fifty representatives attended, with Qin Runqing (秦潤卿) presiding. He first reported that the Ministry of Finance (財部) intends to borrow 2.5 million in cash from the association, using 5 million in 22nd-year customs treasury bills as collateral. After discussion among the representatives of the members, it was agreed that due to the current period of commercial depression, the money trade itself often shows signs of exhaustion. The Ministry of Finance had borrowed money not long ago, and now, before it has recovered its breath, it is even more powerless. However, the suppression of the Red Army is as urgent as fire and cannot be delayed. In order to do the best of the money trade, it was unanimously decided to pledge one million yuan. The method is that each large and small remittance bank will be assigned 10,000 yuan. There are a total of 65 banks in the city, totaling 650,000 yuan. The remaining 350,000 yuan will be subsidized by the Money Trade Reserve. It is said that the Money Trade Association notified each bank yesterday to pay the full amount within three days.</p>
<h3>Reuters Denies Rumors of Chen Jitang's Assassination</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 18th: Last night, it was widely rumored in this port that Reuters had issued news that Chen Jitang (陳濟棠) had been assassinated. However, Reuters did not issue such news and telegraphed its Hong Kong correspondent to inquire about the truth. According to his reply telegram, the rumor of Chen Jitang's assassination has not been verified.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Orders Correction of the Temporary Regulations for Joint Transportation of Responsible Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Two-Route Administration (兩路管理局) received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways (鐵道部) with the number Lian Zi 7294 (聯字第七二九四號), stating that after investigating the temporary regulations for joint transportation of responsible goods by the railway, which had been issued for compliance, it was found that there were slight errors in the typesetting of the articles within the regulations, which should be corrected as follows: Article 33: Each joint transportation route shall use its own open wagons as flatcars (hereinafter referred to as factory cars) to transport joint transportation goods. When tarpaulins and ropes are required, the tarpaulins and ropes of the route must be used and transported directly with the car. The rent for these tarpaulins and ropes will not be calculated separately. All tarpaulins covering joint transportation wagons shall be covered in accordance with the provisions of Article 72 of the detailed rules for responsible transportation of wagons. The front end of the front sheet should cover the front end of the rear sheet to prevent the intrusion of wind, rain, and fire embers. If this car changes direction after passing the track, the starting station should calculate the mileage traveled by the car so that the longest route of the vehicle can be covered in the forward direction. If it travels in the opposite direction on this route or another route, and it is considered that the seams of the tarpaulin are easily invaded by wind, rain, and fire embers, the route may add another tarpaulin to the original car. However, this added tarpaulin should be removed by the route when it is handed over to another route and should not be transported directly. Article 34: The acceptance of tarpaulins and ropes for joint transportation of direct open wagons shall be integrated with the acceptance of the vehicle as a whole. The method is to record the route number of the tarpaulin and rope in the vehicle, the delivery notice, and the route sheet, and accept them together. In addition to separate orders, the above two corrected articles are combined and ordered to be complied with. After receiving the order, the bureau has transferred it to the Transportation Department for compliance. (New News Agency)</p>
<h3>The China Relief Association Plans Winter Relief Matters; Deeply Hopes That All Circles Will Generously Donate Old Clothes and Bedding</h3>
<p>The China Relief Association (中國救濟恊會), in view of the fact that there are many poor and helpless people in this city, deeply sympathizes with their hunger and cold in the winter. Therefore, it resolved at its regular meeting yesterday to plan winter relief matters and detail methods for regular distribution. It also organized a Winter Relief Committee to show its seriousness, with over twenty people from the industrial and commercial sectors, including Xu Minggao, Wu Leisheng, Wang Zhenhua, Zheng Renseng, Chen Xinfu, and Yu Miaosheng, serving as relief committee members and handling the association's general office's relief, communication, and investigation affairs. If kind-hearted people from all walks of life wish to donate old clothes, bedding, money, or rice, they can send them to the association's general office at the intersection of Racecourse Road and Longmen Road. The association will issue receipts and publish acknowledgments in various newspapers. Furthermore, the association's finances and affairs are absolutely public, and people from all walks of life can be invited to audit the accounts at any time to show their authenticity.</p>

<h3>The Dancer Yin Qiulian is Indeed Chinese; Judge Liu Solemnly Declared Yesterday; The Case Has Been Heard and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the 20th</h3>
<p>The dancer Yin Qiulian (尹秋蓮) sued her companion Gao Lili (高利利) for injury. When the First Special District Court (第一特區地方法院) opened the trial a few days ago, Yin spoke English and claimed to be from "Manchukuo." After the news was published in the newspapers, society paid more attention to it. The trial judge, Liu Yugui (劉毓桂), also believed that the issue of Yin's nationality needed to be re-examined. The original plan to announce the verdict yesterday afternoon was therefore suspended, and both sides were specially summoned for oral arguments. At around 3:00 PM, Judge Liu opened the court and announced the reasons for reopening the debate, saying (1) that the case was not fully understood and (2) that the plaintiff's nationality needed to be investigated. He then asked Yin Qiulian about her address and place of origin. Yin still made her statement in English, which was translated into Chinese by an interpreter. She said that she lived at No. 160 Bazilu (靶子路), that her family was originally from Shenyang, and that her parents had always been in Shenyang, where she also grew up. However, because she had received Japanese education, she did not know Mandarin. Although she understood a little, she could not speak it. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chao Kun (巢堃), immediately stood up and stated that the lawyer had gone to Anle Palace (安樂宮) for field investigation and learned that the plaintiff could not only speak Mandarin but also Shanghai dialect. According to her employer, Lu Zuting (陸祖庭), manager Chen (陳姓), and supervisor Yang Mao Yuan (楊毛媛), Yin used a northern accent when talking to them on weekdays. Now that she says she cannot speak Mandarin, it is intentional deception. However, since she said she understood a little, why didn't she immediately state that she was not a "Manchukuo person" when the interpreter translated the word "Manchukuo person" last time? Moreover, the plaintiff's lawyer is good at English. If the interpreter had mistranslated, he should have objected, but he did not correct it. As for Frank, who testified in court last time, claiming to be the manager of the dance hall, was also false. The foreign manager of the dance hall is named Mass. This one spot can reveal the rest, and it can be seen that the plaintiff is all false. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Zongpan (江宗泮), identified it as an interpreter's mistranslation, saying that because of this one sentence, it has aroused social attention. Not only are Chinese newspapers reporting it, but also Japanese newspapers. However, the plaintiff only said she was Manchurian, and the defendant's lawyer immediately dragged her into being a "Manchukuo person," which should not have this view. Judge Liu then declared that this issue was not within the scope of the case, because the plaintiff stated in the complaint that her place of origin was Fengtian, and that day the plaintiff answered the question of her place of origin in English as "Mukden." He heard it very clearly. However, he did not know why it was translated into the word "Manchukuo." Now that the plaintiff has stated that her place of origin is Shenyang, the three eastern provinces are our country's territory, and the people of the three eastern provinces are of course the people of the Republic of China. The plaintiff's expression of intention is very clear, so he hopes that both parties will not discuss the issue of nationality. Judge Liu then repeatedly questioned the plaintiff about the accusations and had the lawyers on both sides re-debate the case, and then ordered the verdict to be announced on the 20th of this month. Furthermore, according to a letter from lawyers Song Chunfang (宋春舫) and Jiang Zongpan (江宗泮), "We, the undersigned, according to the statement of the client Yin Qiulian, yesterday, the newspapers reported a piece of news about the dancer Yin Qiulian suing Gao Lili for the crime of injury. Because the facts are not in accordance with the facts, we have been entrusted to correct it in the record. At the re-opening of the debate today, with regard to the point of nationality, the presiding judge declared in court, 'During the last court hearing, Yin Qiulian did reply with the word (Mukden), that is, Feng (tian or Shenyang), and her complaint also stated the place of origin of Fengtian. Today, she also replied that she is a Chinese person from Fengtian. ' Because the facts have been clarified, this matter is related to the national system and is not shallow, so we ask you to correct it again," According to this corresponding letter, I hope you will check the correction, and to the Shenbao Museum, lawyers Song Chunfang and Jiang Zongpan, November 18th."</p>

<h3>The Monk Kaijue Has Been Imprisoned for More Than a Year; Yesterday, He Was Able to See the Light of Day Again; Kaijue Describes the Process of Being Sent to the Tramp Institute by Kaisheng; He Was Abused and Forbidden to See Guests; He Asked the Judge to Extend Justice; || The Result Was That Both Monks Were Released on Bail and the Hearing Was Rescheduled ||</h3>
<p>The abbot monk Kaisheng (開生) of Guoren Temple (國恩寺) on Villemont Road in the French Concession of this port and the abbot monk Kaijue (開覺) of Chaoyin Cave (潮音洞) on Putuo Mountain (普陀山) are half-brothers from the same master. Both temples are subordinate to the Zizhulin (紫竹林) branch temple on Putuo Mountain. Because the two monks were competing for the current abbot's position, Kaisheng, taking advantage of Kaijue's opportunity to come to Shanghai last year to collect vow money, reported to Wang Yiting (王一亭), a standing committee member of the Buddhist Association, and sent a letter to the Shanghai South Longhua Vagrant Training Institute (滬南龍華游民習勤所) to imprison Kaijue on the grounds that he did not abide by the rules of the temple. He was forbidden to communicate with or meet with people. Until recently, Kaijue's younger brother, also his cousin Jingan (淨安), came to Shanghai and learned about it. He hired a lawyer and went to visit him to inquire about the reasons for his imprisonment. He hired lawyer Li Mian (黎冕) to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court (第二特區地方法院), accusing</p>
<h3>Kaisheng of Obstructing Freedom</h3>
<p>And an incidental civil suit for damages. According to the complaint, on the 31st of last month, Judge Li Changnian (李昌年) opened the court to summon and question him, but because the plaintiff was imprisoned and the defendant Kaisheng claimed to be ill and did not arrive, he was instructed to reschedule the hearing. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the continued hearing arrived again. The court prepared a document and sent bailiffs to the Vagrant Training Institute to bring the plaintiff Kaijue to court. The two lawyers he hired, Li Mian (黎冕) and Dong Banggan (董邦幹), also arrived on time. The defendant Kaisheng also arrived at the court with his defense lawyers, Li Fengshen (李逢申) and Tu Zhengou (屠振鵠), to wait for the hearing. There were many friends and fellow monks related to both parties who came to court to observe, causing the Second Court</p>
<h3>Unusual Crowding</h3>
<p>There was no room to insert a foot. Those who arrived later had to stand outside the court, craning their necks to watch. At 2:30, Judge Li and the clerk Wang Baoxun (王葆薰) took their seats, called the parties and lawyers on both sides to the court, and first questioned the defendant Kaisheng about the process of imprisoning Kaijue in the Vagrant Training Institute. According to his answer, he and Kaijue were brothers from the same master. Because he did not abide by the rules of the temple, he often came to pester him, opened a smoking den on the upper floor of Yongtai Tobacco and Paper Store (永泰烟紙店) at No. 90 Huanghe Road (黄河路), and ordered a 10 yuan vegetarian meal at Juelin Vegetarian Restaurant (覺林素菜館) for no reason, and invited guests to Guoren Temple (國恩寺), but did not pay for the meal, and stole clothes worth dozens of yuan. Because of his various unruly behaviors, he reported to</p>
<h3>Buddhist Layman Wang Yiting</h3>
<p>And wrote a letter to send him to the Vagrant Training Institute to make him change his ways. He was completely well-intentioned, so he paid six yuan for his meals every month. If he was malicious, why would he be willing to pay for his meals? He was asked how Kaijue often came to pester him. He answered that he often came to borrow money from him to spend and did not pay it back. Last year, he borrowed 150 yuan twice, first borrowing 100 yuan in mid-June and then borrowing 50 yuan in mid-September. The abbot monk of Sanguantang (三官堂) on Putuo Mountain (普陀山) wrote a note as proof. When providing the note, he presented a note (written on octavo letter paper) to the court. After examining the note, the official asked, "If you borrowed money from you in June and September of last year, why does the note say March of the 22nd year?" Kaisheng hesitated and replied that it was</p>
<h3>Abbot Monk of Sanguantang</h3>
<p>Who wrote it and he didn't know. The official asked, "Do you know how to read?" He replied that he did not know how to read. Then he laughed and replied that he knew a few words. The official then gave the note to Kaisheng to read. After Kaisheng took the note and looked at it, he said, "This is the 23rd year. This note was written last year." Then he changed his mind and said, "This is the 22nd year. I remembered it wrong. I didn't write the note." The official asked again, "Can your temple regulations be handled like this?" He replied, "According to the temple regulations, if they don't obey the command of the residents and don't abide by the rules of the temple, they can be handled even if they are elders." At this point, the official ordered the plaintiff Kaijue to be brought to the court. According to his statement, he and Kaisheng were master brothers of the same generation, and he called his master uncle. Their relationship has always been ordinary. He was asked, "Have you ever borrowed money from Kaisheng and written a note?" He replied, "I have never borrowed money from him or written a note. My own temple is Chaoyin Cave (潮音洞), which has an income of 10,000 yuan in incense money a year. Guoren Temple (國恩寺) has an income of 30,000 yuan. It's all his [Kaisheng's]".</p>
<h3>Damaging My Reputation</h3>
<p>I was the caretaker of the Chao Yin Cave on Mount Putuo since the twelfth year of the Republic [1923]. Since my master passed away last year, he has been bullying me and dealing with me in this way. His lawyer presented eight account books dating back to the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924] regarding the Chao Yin Cave when I was the caretaker. I am asked how I was confined in the vagrant labor camp. I answered that I was the caretaker of the Chao Yin Cave on Mount Putuo. Because the temple is near the sea, the hall was damaged by a typhoon the year before last. Last year, a pilgrim came to the mountain to burn incense and promised to contribute money for repairs. Because the money had not been fully collected, I came to Shanghai to collect the promised donations. Later, I developed heart and stomach pains and was hospitalized for treatment. Kaisheng sent Shen Yuanlin to the hospital to call me and said that his grand-disciple Yuanlin was smoking opium and violating the rules.</p>
<h3>Calling Me to Accompany Him to Be Sent Away</h3>
<p>He wanted me to accompany him to the vagrant labor camp for opium cessation. I thought it was a good deed to send someone to quit opium, so I agreed to go to Guogen Temple on October 21st. Kaisheng told me to hire a car to send Yuanlin to the vagrant labor camp. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, I was immediately detained and not allowed to return. They said all sorts of bad things about me, stripped me of my clothes, made me wear vagrant clothes, and locked me in a dark prison. I had no tea or water to drink all day, and the food was not enough to eat. I was also handcuffed and not allowed to speak. If I disobeyed, I would be hit on the palm of my hand two or three hundred times, I do not know the exact number. I was beaten several times and not allowed visitors until after this lawyer came to see me, when I was moved to another room with slightly better treatment. Now my</p>
<h3>Whole Body Aches</h3>
<p>I also have a lump in my chest. I request an examination. I also stated that Guogen Temple and Chao Yin Cave are both subordinate temples of the Zizhu Forest. The abbots of the two temples are supposed to rotate every three years. Kaisheng's term was up, and he should have been rotated to become the abbot of Guogen Temple. He did this to me because he was afraid that I would take his position as abbot, declaring that he would imprison me until I die, so that he could do whatever he wanted afterwards. Since I was imprisoned, all the affairs of the Chao Yin Cave have been taken over by Kaisheng. Also, because Guang Sheng was very harsh to the visiting monks in Guogen Temple, and the visiting monks told me about it, I advised Kaisheng about it. Because of this, he hated and envied me, and took</p>
<h3>Such Cruel and Vicious Measures</h3>
<p>to imprison me. Now I do not want to go back to the vagrant labor camp. I would rather face a lawsuit here. I ask for justice. If the judge finds any illegal behavior on my part, he can punish me severely. I will gladly accept it. The judge then asked if anyone from the Buddhist Association was present. At this point, Yuan Xilian, the lawyer who had been commissioned by the defendant to appear in court, withdrew from representing the defendant yesterday and appeared on behalf of the Buddhist Association, stating, "Our lawyer is the perennial legal advisor of the Buddhist Association. Today, I am here on behalf of the Buddhist Association to state that the Buddhist Association received a report from Kaisheng about Kaijue's various illegal activities, which were investigated and resolved. A letter was sent to the vagrant labor camp. If the court needs to ask about the detailed circumstances at that time,"</p>
<h3>Representative of the Buddhist Association</h3>
<p>"Is also present in court today and can be summoned for questioning." The judge then summoned him. According to Wang Junhe, who filed the case, he works in the secretariat of the Buddhist Association. He said that he was present in court today to observe the proceedings. The personnel who handled this matter before have left their positions, and he does not know the details. He said that he would need to ask layman Wang Yiting and could reply in writing later. Wang then left. The defendant then claimed, "My appointment as caretaker of the Chao Yin Cave was at the request of the people, not a seizure of his position." At this point, the judge said that the case still needed to be investigated and that the defendant's statement of defense had not yet been filed. He then asked the lawyers from both sides if they had any opinions. The lawyers from both sides</p>
<h3>Expressed Their Opinions on the Case</h3>
<p>and argued fiercely. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had been illegally detained for more than a year and that the court should release him today and restore his freedom. As a result, the court ordered both parties to post bail and await another hearing at a later date. The defendant was also ordered to submit a statement of defense within three days. Because yesterday was Saturday and it was late when court adjourned, filing a statement and posting bail would have been impossible. The lawyers from both sides requested that they be temporarily responsible for the bail. Both parties left and would submit formal bail bonds on Monday. The court granted permission and ordered the lawyers from both sides to issue letters of guarantee for filing. Both parties left with their respective lawyers. The plaintiff, Kaijue, had been imprisoned for a year and a month and was only able to regain his freedom yesterday. However, it is still difficult to predict who will win in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Pre-Trial of Three Days of Theft, Robbery, and Robbery Gang Crimes</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily News, Yoshikawa Kanezo, who was arrested on the 30th for theft, robbery, and robbery gang crimes, confessed after interrogation by the Consul General that Yoshikawa went to the residence of Dr. Zhang Yingming, a dentist on North Zhejiang Road, at 2 p.m. on May 11th. Because he had previously received an order for 35 ounces of morphine, he conspired with Yuichi Hosoya and a Chinese person named Sheng to pretend that flour was morphine and brought it to Zhang's residence. Yoshikawa then demanded 600 yuan from Zhang's wife, ordering her to open the money box. When the box was opened, there were only 380 yuan. He then seized all the cash and fled. In addition, Ryoji Nishiki, a robber who was arrested on September 3, and Koryo Kiyoshi, were also pre-trialed by the Consul General.</p>
<h3>Two Young Men Take Poison and Express Great Sorrow, The Deceased Shen Xingji Is Unknown, Xue Tong Once Studied at His Correspondence School, He Never Sang Xiaosheng at the Great World, Absolute Denial of the 50 Yuan Introduction Fee</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported that two young men, Shen Xingji and Xue Tong, planned to become movie stars and entered a film school run by Chen Dabe. Chen promised to introduce them to the Lianhua Film Company as actors after graduation. After Shen and others graduated, they asked Chen to arrange for their placement. Chen agreed at the time. However, after a day or two, Chen said that if they wanted to be introduced as actors, they would have to pay an additional introduction fee of 50 yuan. Shen and others were unable to raise the money, so they committed suicide by poisoning themselves at the Great China Hotel. As a result, Shen Xingji died from an overdose of poison, while Xue Tong could still be saved. Last night, Chen Dabe came to the newspaper and claimed that he did not know who the deceased Shen was. Xue Tong had enrolled in a film correspondence school established by Dabe, but dropped out in less than two months. This was a matter from October. He did not expect that there would suddenly be talk of a 50 yuan introduction fee to Lianhua Film Company. After students graduate from the school, the school can of course find a way out for the students, but how can someone who has only studied for two months be introduced into the film industry? As for Dabe, he has never sang Xiaosheng at the Great World. Dabe is now researching radio drama. In addition to broadcasting Red Flower Vase (Guanyin Opera) every night at the Fuxing Radio Station, he is temporarily making a living by writing.</p>
<h3>Small Guanyuan Garden to Hold Chrysanthemum Gathering Today</h3>
<p>The chrysanthemums of Xiaoguan Garden have always been famous. A few days ago, they participated in the Municipal Chrysanthemum Exhibition, and because they had set aside a separate room with beautiful decorations and a rich variety of chrysanthemums, they were deeply praised by elegant viewers. However, the garden still has several thousand potted and fence chrysanthemums that are late-blooming and grown from seeds. Today, they have specially invited Wang Xiaolai, Wang Xishen, Wu Xingya, Wu Huanru, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Guansheng, Yan Duhe, Zhou Shoujuan, Liu Bosen, Li Kangnian, and over a hundred other people to hold a chrysanthemum gathering to get a complete view.

<h3>Real Estate Association Asks Municipal Council to Order Water Company to Turn on Water Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association has repeatedly received comparative tables of new and old water bills from its members Deli Company and Gu Lanji, requesting that it negotiate with the Municipal Council to promptly order the water company to turn on the water and convene a water fee committee. The association has sent two letters to the Municipal Council, requesting that it protect the lives of tax-paying citizens. The relevant documents are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Water Bill Comparison: "Deli Company" is located in Baishou Lane between Pingliang Road, Huasheng Road, and Fenzhou Road. Under the contracted water system, the total cost for six months was 1,083 yuan and 40 cents. Now, under the water meter system, the cost for six months is 2,187 yuan, 27 cents, more than double the previous amount. Baifu, Bailu, and Lane, located between Huasheng Road, Yangzhou Road, and Fenzhou Road, cost 1,347 yuan and 09 cents for six months under the contracted water system. Now, under the water meter system, the cost for six months is 3,017 yuan, 65 cents, an increase of one and a half times compared to the previous amount. "Gu Lanji" is located on Yuanfang Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou. Under the contracted water system, the cost for six months was 39 yuan and 12 cents. Now, under the water meter system, the cost for six months is 97 yuan and 90 cents. The water meter number on Wuzhou Road is 373. Under the contracted water system, the cost for six months was 958 yuan and 56 cents. Now, under the water meter system, the cost for six months is 5,115 yuan, 99 cents, an increase of more than five and a half times compared to the previous amount.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council: (1) Sirs, we are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the Deli Management Accounting Office, a member of our association, stating that the water supply to all the Baifu, Bailu, and Baishou Lanes of our company, located between Pingliang Road and Yangzhou Road, was suddenly cut off from the two main pipes by the water company at 9 am this morning. The drinking water for thousands of residents has been completely cut off, and the public's emotions are surging and indescribable. The situation is urgent, and we request that you immediately negotiate with the Municipal Council to order the water pipes to be reconnected to avoid the occurrence of unfortunate events. Based on this, we have learned that such high-pressure tactics of the water company must have a predetermined plan in secret, hoping to create a major situation and sacrificing the lives of users to show its power. The delay in convening the Water Fee Committee makes one suspect that it was also set up for this plan. However, it is the duty of the municipal authorities to protect the lives of tax-paying citizens. According to the information in the letter, we hereby request that your bureau quickly order the water company to restore the water supply to protect the lives of the people and fulfill humanity. As for the water fee issue, we will wait for the committee to convene and discuss the matter at length. (2) Sirs, we are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the Deli Management Accounting Office, a member of our association, stating that we are now sending two copies of a list of the old and new water fee price ratios for Baifu Lane, Bailu Lane, and Baishou Lane, located between Pingliang Road and Yangzhou Road, so that you can understand the true situation. After receiving the letter, please quickly negotiate with the Municipal Council to order the water to be turned on and convene the Water Fee Committee to discuss the matter at length to seek a solution. Respectfully, [addressed to] General Manager Zhong of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Wang Fusheng Invents Secret Wireless Radio, Second Trial in Beijing Successfully Concluded, Expanded Trial in Shanghai to Resume</h3>
<p>Student Wang Fusheng of National Tongji University previously invented a type of secret wireless radio, which was tested at the Central Research Institute in this city and yielded good results. Later, he was introduced by the school to Nanjing for testing, and various military agencies and the Ministry of Education assisted in guiding him. Wang's test site in Beijing was only inside the Central Research Institute in Nanjing. Wu Dao, deputy director of the radio station and Liu Zhenqing, chief engineer of the Central Party Headquarters. Xie Shuying, section chief of the Ministry of Education. All attended the scene to provide guidance. Wang then tested the secret functions of the wireless radio he invented, and the results were extremely satisfactory. All parties praised it greatly. A certain military agency even adopted a part of it. Wang has now returned to Shanghai to continue his research and will have further inventions. He also plans to invite all circles to conduct an expanded trial.</p>
<h3>Moving Stones and Selling Strips, Kidnappers Set Up Traps to Separate Families, Two Cases Solved Together, Criminals Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhang Wang, a woman from Changzhou, is 37 years old. Her husband, Zhang Heshang, suddenly went blind six years ago and has not recovered his sight. As a result, they have been living off their savings, and their livelihood has been cut off. On the 12th of this month, she brought her seven-year-old daughter, Rongguan, to Shanghai, intending to work in a cloth factory. She had a relative living at No. 8 Hengqing Lane on Baylor Road. When she first arrived in Shanghai, after getting off at the Xieqiao stop, she asked a police officer for directions. Suddenly, a man lightly patted her shoulder and said that he could take her there. She was very grateful and followed him. The man then asked her about her life and learned that she had come to work. He then said that he could not recommend her to work in Shanghai without a guarantor. He had a friend who was a factory foreman and would do a good deed by introducing her. The woman thought that they had met by chance and that she had found a good friend, so she thanked him and went with him. When they arrived at the teahouse, the man said that she was covered in dust and should wash her face and drink tea while waiting for his friend to come. The woman then washed her face, and while her face was bent over the washbasin, the man carried her daughter away. After the woman finished washing, she looked around for her daughter and the so-called good man, but they were nowhere to be found. She shouted, but no one responded. She knew that she had been tricked and cried loudly, but there was nothing she could do. As a result, the woman looked for her daughter every day for eight days, pawning almost everything she had. Until the day before yesterday, she saw the man who had kidnapped her child in a hotel in Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, drinking quietly. She immediately went inside and grabbed him, saying, "Let's go back to Xieqiao to discuss it." They went together to a teahouse in Xieqiao, and some hooligans were called out. They said to the woman, "The person is gone, but we can give you dozens of yuan to settle the matter." The woman refused and grabbed his chest. The man then became violent and escaped. The woman shouted "Catch the kidnapper!" Just then, Liu Yigao, a rickshaw puller, whose six-year-old son, Xiaolong, had also been kidnapped eight days earlier, was investigating the kidnappers. Upon hearing that a kidnapper had been caught, he realized that it was his enemy. He immediately chased after him, grabbed him, and called the police to take him to the Second District Police Station. It was learned that his name was Jin Ming and that he specialized in kidnapping. The woman's daughter and Liu's son were both kidnapped by the same gang, which had set up traps. Kidnapping boys was called "moving stones," and kidnapping girls was called "selling strips." Because two cases had been solved together, the man was immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau, and he was transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Citizens on Fourth Avenue Write to Municipal Council Requesting Prohibition of Illegal Street Vendors</h3>
<p>The Fourth Avenue Business Federation and the 20th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation, because street vendors on the road disturb the business market and sell counterfeit gold watches, fountain pens, and obscene photos, which harm society, have sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting a prohibition. The letter reads, "Sirs, in the middle section of this road (from Fujian Road to Shandong Road), there are street vendors setting up stalls and shouting to sell goods along the way. The sidewalks are blocked. Even worse, a group of unemployed vagrants use counterfeit gold watches, fountain pens, and dirty photos (commonly known as spring palaces) to deceive money. This situation was the subject of a letter to your office on May 6, requesting that you strictly prohibit it. Although it was slightly cleaner at that time, it has been a long time, and it is as noisy as before. The shops in that section of the road cannot bear the disturbance and have repeatedly asked our association to find a way to prohibit it. Fourth Avenue is a bustling commercial district, and its commercial traffic is the most prosperous of all roads. The middle and eastern sections have many stores that promote culture. It should not be allowed to hide these activities. If they use counterfeit gold watches, fountain pens, etc. to impersonate stolen goods and deceive money, it is even more illegal. The sale of dirty photos is obscene to young children and is particularly harmful. This kind of behavior is extremely illegal. How can society tolerate it? If it is allowed to develop naturally, it will not only damage the business of each store, but also hinder social culture and pedestrian safety. Our association is a group of citizens and merchants on this road. The prosperity of the business on this road and the safety of pedestrians are closely related to us. We are also requesting a prohibition from the majority of our members. We are writing again after further investigation to request that your director dispatch plainclothes detectives to be stationed there permanently and to completely prohibit them. Otherwise, they will hide when they are arrested and reappear when they are gone, which is not a fundamental solution. We have always admired your director's concern for society, and we believe that you will not allow these corrupt elements that harm society to develop naturally. If we are truly grateful for your thorough prohibition, we will be deeply grateful. Respectfully, [addressed to] Police Chief of the Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

There are a total of 30 breaches, large and small, within 20 kilometers from Shitou Village Railway Station. The 29th breach has now been blocked. The 1st to 26th breaches are all dry breaches, which have been divided into ten sections for contract construction. Construction started at the end of October and is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. The 27th and 30th breaches are the most severe and have caused the most damage. The water flow has not stopped until now, and the project is more difficult. Currently, resources and manpower are concentrated here in order to block the water before the freezing period. According to reports, the first, second, and fourth channels of the water inlet have been significantly silted up after being hung with willow trees. The situation is very good. However, the water flow is concentrated, and the third channel is flowing very rapidly. A diversion canal is being excavated outside the water inlet, and a water-facing dam is being built to divert the water from the water inlet back to the river channel. 300 American pine trees and tens of thousands of burlap sacks have been purchased and transported, along with more than 60 tons of lead, which will be transported twice via the Pinghan Railway. Other materials are also being purchased and transported in order to carry out large-scale damming, which will be successful in the near future. "District 3" (Xiaopang Village on the south bank of Changyuan, Hebei): After correcting the embankment line for damming the breach, the earthwork is calculated to be 72,774.94 cubic meters, which is divided into seven sections for contract construction. Construction started on October 26 and is scheduled to be completed within 41 days. Later, the height of the embankment was increased by five centimeters, increasing the earthwork by more than 6,000 cubic meters, for a total of 79,133.37 cubic meters, estimated to require 48,208.17 yuan. There are 3,000 flood workers currently, and one-quarter of the work has been completed. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Asks for Strict Prohibition of Tax Evasion on Postal Parcels of Cigarettes, Sends Letter to Postal Administration to Issue Circular for Prohibition</h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the 21st Army of Sichuan Province's anti-communist campaign has already issued an order for a general offensive and has achieved great victories. However, tax revenue is short, which is detrimental to military needs. Recently, various tax bureaus in Sichuan Province have submitted reports, stating that merchants in Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and other places are packing cigarettes into small boxes, forming postal parcels, without any factory tax receipts, and sending them through the post office to various counties in Sichuan Province, hoping to evade Chongqing-Wan County taxes and duties, which affects military needs. The headquarters of the 21st Army has now informed the Eastern Sichuan Postal Administration, which forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration, ordering all provinces to investigate and prohibit it. Postal parcels sent from the Shanghai Postal Administration must be inspected by customs. Various cigarettes cannot be sent without factory tax receipts. However, postal branches in Hankou, Yichang, and Minhang and Zhoujiaqiao near Shanghai can send parcels without tax receipts. There must be some tax evasion, which affects not only the cigarette tax revenue of Sichuan Province. The postal authorities should order all bureaus to prohibit the sending of parcels without tax receipts in accordance with regulations.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, which stated: "Respectfully, on the 16th of this month, we received Instruction No. 17415 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated: 'The Henan Xin Chang Bank Creditors' Liquidation Committee has sent a letter stating that Xin Chang Bank suspended operations on October 11th. Creditors should elect representatives to form the Xin Chang Bank Creditors' Delegation. The Creditors' Delegation, together with officials and leaders from all sectors, will form the Xin Chang Bank Debt Liquidation Committee, which will be responsible for liquidating all movable and immovable property of the bank to restore operations, protect rights and interests, and avoid disputes. Since its establishment, the committee has been fortunate to have the support of government offices, experts, and various parties. The work is progressing smoothly, and the Henan Provincial Government has agreed to allocate 300,000 yuan as working capital for the bank's resumption of business. The future is very optimistic. However, this matter is of great importance and must be based on the opinions of all creditors. The debts in Kaifeng are only over 900,000 yuan. The representatives of creditors from other branches have not yet arrived. In addition to the Henan Provincial Government's telegram to the Executive Yuan, which has been forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments, to instruct creditors in the relevant areas to elect representatives to come and participate, we hereby send a letter to your bureau, instructing local creditors to quickly elect representatives to come and participate in the joint effort. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly and reply.' Due to the above, we hereby issue this notice, hoping that you will investigate and inform your fellow traders that if anyone has a creditor relationship with the bank, they should, within ten days of receiving this letter, provide a clear statement of the amount owed and report it to this chamber for verification. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<h3>Fu Hua Goes to Digang to Rescue the Stranded Qingpu Steamer - The Forecastle of the Qingpu Takes on Water and Collides with the Digang Wharf</h3>
<p>The Qingpu steamer of the Sanbei Company ran aground in Digang and damaged the Digang wharf. The situation is quite serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Damage to the Wharf: It is found that the Qingpu steamer ran aground in front of the Hanyeping wharf in Digang. At the time of the accident, it somehow sailed into the Hanyeping wharf and ran aground on the shallow shore. At that time, when the ship moved sideways into the wharf, it collided with the wharf due to its heavy load. The outer barrier of the wharf was damaged. A ship of the Japanese Postal Coastal Society carrying iron ore sand was docked outside the wharf, but fortunately it was not hit. As for the extent of the damage to the wharf, Shanghai is not yet able to know in detail.</p>
<p>Damage to the Forecastle: The shallow beach where the Qingpu was stranded is not sandy, but a rocky beach. Therefore, the heavy-laden Qingpu collided heavily when it suddenly rushed in. It is heard that the bottom of the Qingpu's forecastle has been broken and is taking on water. The company has not publicly announced the details of the accident and the damage, so it is only known that the ship has been broken, and the situation is quite serious, but the detailed situation is not yet known.</p>
<p>Fu Hua to the Rescue: The ship cannot be rescued at present. Yesterday, the company decided to send the newly renovated upstream river steamer Fu Hua to tow a large iron barge and depart from Shanghai this morning to Digang to unload the cargo and passengers from the Qingpu to Shanghai, and then try to tow the Qingpu out of danger. The loss of the damaged wharf will be investigated and verified separately. Therefore, there is no hope of rescuing the Qingpu in the short term.</p>

<h3>Accountants' Association Cables Request to Implement Original Diplomatic Intention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants' Association cabled the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the ministers of the various departments of the Nanjing National Government: Since reports of negotiations in Peiping on issues such as through traffic, through mail, and the establishment of customs with the puppet Manchukuo have been reported, public sentiment has been confused. Premier Wang Jingwei's report on his visit to Japan and the deletion of the telegram from Japan show that the foreign policy is determined to be based on the principle of not harming sovereignty, which is extremely commendable. However, the situation in North China is still unclear, and the people's concerns have not been dispelled. Our association has witnessed the tragedy of the shrinking territory day by day and deeply fears the sinking of China. We respectfully request the central government to implement the original diplomatic intention and absolutely refuse to negotiate with the Japanese side on the above-mentioned proposals, so that words and actions are consistent and the people's hopes are comforted. Sincerely, the Shanghai Accountants' Association, Xiao."</p>
<p>Another cable to the Legislative Yuan stated: "To President Sun Ke and the members of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan: Since the Tanggu Truce was concluded, the diplomatic trend has suddenly become confusing, and various opinions have arisen, causing internal and external anxiety. Fortunately, your Excellencies have acted with national sincerity, concerned about the misunderstandings of the people and the international community, and specially requested Premier Wang Jingwei to attend the meeting to report on foreign policy and the scope of his authority. As a result, the previous worries have been slightly relieved. However, it is heard that the situation in North China is still urgent, and diplomatic events are still changing. We still hope that you will be consistent from beginning to end, and do not hesitate to speak out frequently, so as to adhere to your position and live up to the people's hopes. Sincerely, the Shanghai Accountants' Association, Qiao."</p>
<h3>Yi Cheng Paper Company Responds and Clarifies on the Case of Inferior Paper at the New Culture Bookstore, Hoping that the Paper Industry Association Will Thoroughly Investigate</h3>
<p>Da Gong She reports that the purchase of Japanese paper by the New Culture Bookstore on Fourth Road has attracted much attention after being announced by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The bookstore published a statement in the newspaper a few days ago, stating that the paper was purchased from Yi Cheng and other four paper companies. The Paper Industry Association sent letters to the relevant factories to inquire. A reply was received, stating: "Respectfully, we have received your letter and learned about the New Culture Bookstore publishing books using enemy goods. However, the bookstore sent letters to various newspapers claiming that the paper used was purchased from Xing Ji, Yuan He, Fu Feng, Yi Cheng, etc., which seems to be somewhat suspicious. We have sold Jishi rolled paper to the bookstore, but only delivered it to the San Min and Xin Guo Min printing houses, Hua Wen, etc. We hope that your association will thoroughly investigate the source of these enemy goods to clarify the truth. Yi Cheng Paper Company." The replies from Xing Ji, Yuan He, and Fu Feng were similar in wording and are omitted.</p>
<h3>Protracted Three Friends Lawsuit Remains Unresolved, Special First District Court Assists in Execution</h3>
<p>The labor-capital dispute case of the Three Friends Industrial Company in Pudong has been in court for nearly two years since the capital side refused to accept the arbitration decision of the Municipal Government. In April of this year, the Supreme Court ruled to reject the capital side's appeal and handed it over to the Shanghai District Court for execution according to law. Although the court repeatedly ordered both parties to go out and find ways to reconcile, the capital side had no sincerity, so the two parties could not approach each other. On the 24th of last month, when the court opened the twelfth execution hearing, it determined that reconciliation had failed and, because the capital side's head office was located in the Public Concession, decided to entrust the First Special District Court to assist in the execution of the dismissal fee of 75,095 yuan for the dismissed employees. After receiving the letter, the First Special District Court opened a hearing at 9:00 AM on the 17th of this month. Zhang Yihai and Gong Yuting, representatives of the camp, and lawyer Wei Wenhan, the agent, and Zhang Shizhao, the agent lawyer of the capital side, were present. Judge Jiang ascended the twelfth court for questioning and ordered the capital side's agent lawyer to convey to the company to pay the full amount of the dismissal fee within ten days, otherwise, the company would be sealed up. Then he announced the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Workers Petitioned Yesterday - Yu Hongjun Agreed to Order the Factory to Revise Factory Regulations, but Advised Workers Not to Take Excessive Actions</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the Anglo-American Tobacco Company has repeatedly refused to revise the labor-capital treaty and does not allow the union to collect membership fees. All workers are brewing a strike. The union petitioned the party and government organs yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Refusal to Revise Conditions</h3>
<p>The contract revised in the sixteenth year between the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's labor and capital is inconsistent with the current treatment. More than 3,600 workers requested the union to propose revisions. The union submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau in the spring of this year to revise it. Because of the re-election of the union at that time, a dispute occurred, so the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to suspend the progress. After the re-election was completed, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union repeatedly urged the authorities to expedite the handling. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned and mediated several times, but the company submitted a written report, saying that the current Factory Law no longer requires the existence of a labor-capital contract, so it repeatedly refused to attend, making it impossible to proceed.</p>
<h3>No Collection of Membership Fees Allowed</h3>
<p>Since the capital side repeatedly refused to negotiate and revise the labor-capital contract, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union held a representative meeting in November to discuss the revision of the treaty and asked the Municipal Government for arbitration. On the 16th of this month, the union went to the gate of the new and old factories as usual to collect membership fees when the workers were off work. Unexpectedly, the factory strictly refused and even sounded the police to drive them away. The company usually lets female workers off work at about 2:00 PM, and male workers at 5:00 PM. On that day, it notified the staff of each workshop in advance to inform the workers not to pay membership fees, and ordered male and female workers to leave the factory at the same time when they were off work. Thousands of workers poured out, making it impossible for the union to collect fees.</p>
<h3>Union Petitions Party and Government</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union believes that the capital side's actions are deliberately undermining the labor movement. Yesterday morning, it sent representatives Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Li Chunde, Hong Meiquan, Yin Shigeng, Chen Shaoqing, and others to petition the party and government organs, requesting the speedy revision of the conditions. First, they went to the Municipal Party Department, where Zhou Lianze, the director of the Civil Training Section, received them. He promised to submit the workers' request to the Municipal Government and expedite the revision, and ordered the factory to accept mediation. Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, received them and promised to approve the revision of the factory regulations and continue to negotiate the conditions in the near future. He also promised to correct the factory's actions and advised the representatives not to take excessive actions and wait for the party and government to mediate. When they arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau, because yesterday was Saturday, the office hours had passed, so the representatives left a petition and returned.</p>

<h3>Fang Jiufu Silver Shop in Nanshi Robbed</h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, Fang Jiufu Silver Shop, a newly opened shop with house number 4 at the intersection of Malu Bridge on Nanshi Station Road, was suddenly visited by two robbers, one wearing a grey cloth cotton robe and the other wearing blue cloth shirt and pants.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the news article published in your newspaper on November 18 concerning the sudden death of an apprentice at the Meyer Silk Weaving Factory. The article mentioned that the prosecutor inquired with Mr. Lü Xizhang, the manager of the Meyer factory, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Upon investigation, our company has no branch factory on Father Du Road, nor is there a manager named Lü Xizhang. The apprentice Zhao Zhiming, who reportedly died suddenly, is also not an apprentice of our company. It is presumed that this is due to a misunderstanding of rumors. We would be grateful if you could make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Meyer Silk Weaving Factory Co., Ltd.</p>

<h3>Tangshan Jiaotong University Prepares to Reopen</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th) The Tangshan War Zone Compilation Committee has concluded its work. The chairman, Li Jichun, has also left. On the 17th, personnel were sent to repair the Tangshan Jiaotong University campus, which had been occupied, and will convene faculty and staff to discuss and prepare for the reopening date.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Exempts Tuition and Accommodation Fees for All Provincial Middle Schools, Effective in the Second Semester of This Year</h3>
<p>The tuition and accommodation fees collected by all provincial middle schools in Jiangsu Province amount to 200,000 yuan annually. This amount is listed in the Jiangsu Provincial Education Budget as administrative income to be formally disbursed as regular expenses. After the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the exemption of tuition and accommodation fees for all provincial middle schools, the "school administrative income" item in the education budget was reduced by 200,000 yuan. The method of offsetting this is to add two jiao per shi (unit of dry measure) under the Caomi (tribute rice) provincial tax item. The total tribute rice levy in Jiangsu Province is approximately 1.5 million shi per year. Due to harvest failures and arrears from the people, it is not possible to collect the full amount. After discounts, the amount will be about 200,000 yuan, calculated at two jiao per shi, which will be used to offset the exemption of tuition and accommodation fees. It is understood that the tribute rice tax was first established by the Consultative Bureau in the Xinhai year (1911), and in the first year of the Republic (1912), the Provincial Assembly agreed to levy five yuan per shi of tribute rice, divided into provincial and county taxes: four yuan for the province and one yuan for the county, or two yuan and five fen of silver per tael: one yuan and seven jiao and five fen for the province and three jiao for the county. Since the establishment of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, with the separation of education funds, the provincial tax of four yuan per shi of tribute rice is collected by the Finance Department for two yuan and six jiao, and the education fund receives one yuan and four jiao. The provincial tax of one yuan and seven jiao and five fen per tael of silver is collected by the Finance Department for one yuan and two jiao and eight fen, and the education fund receives four jiao and seven fen. After the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the method of offsetting the exemption of tuition and accommodation fees for middle schools, starting from the winter tribute rice levy this year, the provincial tax of four yuan per shi of tribute rice is collected by the Finance Department for two yuan and four jiao (a decrease of two jiao compared to before), and the education fund receives one yuan and six jiao (an increase of two jiao compared to before). Although the education fund for tribute rice has increased by two jiao per shi, the actual burden on the people has not increased at all. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly ordered the 61 counties in Jiangsu to remit two jiao more per shi for education funds starting from the winter tribute rice levy this year. This matter concerns the relief of poor children throughout Jiangsu Province, allowing them to receive secondary education free of charge, and must be implemented. The order instructs all counties not to neglect their duties. Free admission to all provincial middle schools will be implemented uniformly starting from the second semester of this year, as the winter tribute rice levy has just begun, so the fees will still be charged as usual for the autumn semester.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaoji Temporarily Serves as President of the Merchant Marine School</h3>

Chen has gone to Shanghai to take over the duties of acting president.</p>
<h3>Wuben School to Resume Classes Tomorrow. ▲ Director Pan and Principal Yan Visited the School Yesterday to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>The Wuben Girls' Middle School in this city has experienced unrest. Over the past few days, representatives of the faculty and staff have been persuading the students and requesting lenient treatment from the Education Bureau. The situation is gradually easing. According to reliable information obtained by reporters, the students of the school requested Director Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau and Principal Yan Zhenyu to visit the school in person at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday to give instructions. More than twenty grade representatives and faculty and staff representatives, including Zhu Xiangwan, Wu Jingqu, and Lu Su'an, were present. First, Director Pan gave instructions, with earnest encouragement. Then, the principal and student representatives spoke, all expressing their willingness to cooperate in the spirit of teachers and students to jointly seek the development of Wuben. A major wave has thus subsided. The Education Bureau has formally announced the approval to resume classes, and the school has also notified the parents of all students that classes will officially resume next Monday (the 20th). The announcement from the Municipal Education Bureau is recorded below:</p>
<p>The announcement states: This Bureau previously ordered the temporary suspension of classes at the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School due to the fact that some students interfered with school administration and acted beyond their bounds, pending reorganization. Now, according to the report of the faculty and staff representatives of the school, they have repeatedly persuaded the students, and the students have realized their mistakes. It is appropriate to resume classes from November 20th. In addition to ordering the school to comply, this announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>▲ Pan Gongzhan's Talk on Resumption of Classes. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau of this city, issued a statement yesterday, explaining the handling of matters as follows: Wuben is the only municipal girls' middle school in this city. In recent years, the students have developed rapidly and made great progress. Therefore, I have high hopes for the future of the school. Unexpectedly, this time, due to the change of principals, the actions of some students overstepped the line, which is extremely unfortunate. My handling of this matter has been impartial. Principal Wang Xiaoying has been in charge of the school for many years, and this Bureau had no intention of transferring her. However, due to her concurrent duties, she firmly expressed her desire to resign, and attempts to retain her were unsuccessful. Therefore, this Bureau appointed Ms. Yan Zhenyu, former professor at Jinan University and Daxia University, to succeed her. Ms. Yan has served in the education sector for many years, and her scholarship and experience have always been considered rich. Having her lead Wuben is very suitable. Unexpectedly, the students were emotionally impulsive and interfered with the school administration, which is extremely regrettable. In order to protect the students' studies, I have also personally given them advice. However, some students surrounded me, intending to hold me hostage. While I cannot bear to see the students' studies neglected, I also cannot sit idly by and watch the destruction of the school spirit. After consideration, I deeply feel that reorganization is necessary. Moreover, the school order is chaotic, and the entry and exit of the gates are unchecked, which raises concerns about other accidents. Therefore, on the orders of the mayor, I temporarily ordered unarmed police officers to check entry and exit near the school gate, purely for the sake of maintaining order. Later, the faculty and staff came forward to persuade the students, urging them to realize their mistakes. I then immediately withdrew the police officers. I only seek a quick resolution to the student unrest and for the students to resume classes as soon as possible. Under the principle that students are not allowed to interfere in school administration, I have spared no effort to seek compromise in order to maintain education. Fortunately, the students have realized their mistakes, so all problems have been solved easily. The student unrest has now come to an end. I have now ordered Principal Yan and the new and old faculty and staff to quickly reorganize the school order. From the 20th, the school can resume its original state and continue classes as usual.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Rectifies Military Training in All Schools. ▲ Military Equipment Should Be Handled According to the Minimum Standards. ▲ Military Instructors May Not Appoint Others to Act as Substitutes Without Authorization.</h3>
<p>In order to rectify military training in all schools in accordance with the Ministry's order, the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued instructions to municipal and private senior high schools in this city, stating that military equipment should be handled according to the minimum standards and that military instructors may not appoint others to act as substitutes. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Equipment Should Comply with Minimum Standards</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Order No. 1234 states: Approved by the Directorate General of Military Training, it is found that the Ministry previously stipulated a minimum equipment standard table in August of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), requesting notification to all schools to comply with it, as military equipment is crucial to the implementation of military education. Currently, according to reports from military instructors in various schools, most have been unable to actively procure equipment due to unspecified funding. They propose requesting a transfer of funds from various departments to facilitate the process, etc. The aforementioned is indeed the actual situation. Accordingly, we are informing you to examine this matter and to instruct the education departments of various provinces to consider handling the funding for military equipment in schools under their jurisdiction to facilitate training. We also hope to receive a reply, etc. It is hereby approved to instruct all public and private high schools and above under your jurisdiction to comply with this order, in addition to issuing an order.</p>
<h3>Instructors Cannot Appoint Substitutes</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Order No. 11499 states: Approved by the Directorate General of Military Training, it is found that military instructors in various schools must not appoint others to act as substitutes without authorization or be absent from class arbitrarily. The Ministry has repeatedly issued orders on this matter. Currently, according to reports, some instructors in various schools still secretly and arbitrarily appoint others to act as substitutes for their duties while engaging in other activities, which is detrimental to the progress of military training. In addition to reiterating the previous order to instruct all school instructors not to request leave or be absent from their posts unless due to marriage, funerals, or major events, those who need to request leave and have been approved by submitting a report must also consult with the principal to request someone to substitute for their duties, but the term must not exceed one month, in order to emphasize their responsibilities. In addition to sending a restatement, we are notifying you to examine this matter and to inform all schools under your jurisdiction of this matter. We are issuing this order. The order to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Women's Basketball Yesterday's Two Games</h3>

<p>▲Qiangdong Defeats Qiangnan...Twenty-Eight to Sixteen</p>
<p>丨Three Matches Tonight丨</p>
<p>The first Shanghai women's basketball game last night was between Qiangdong and Qiangnan. They were originally classmates, but to participate in this championship, they had to temporarily turn into rivals. The battle was both real and feigned, and extremely intense. However, the younger sister, despite her hard work, ultimately could not withstand the elder sister's close-range and long-range shots. As a result, Qiangdong won with a score of twenty-eight to sixteen.</p>

<h3>Three-Team Sports Meet: White Rainbow, Russian Overseas Chinese, Japanese Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Today at 1 PM</p>
<p>Gathering at Hongkou Park</p>
<p>Russian Overseas Chinese Include Fierce Generals</p>
<p>Shanghai has held an international sports meet for many years, gathering athletes from various countries to improve their skills. The meaning is good and the interest is abundant, but due to regulations, it is held only once a year. The opportunity for competition is regrettably few. Therefore, after the end of this year's international sports meet, there was a proposal to plan a private group competition. At that time, the White Rainbow Track and Field Team, the Russian Overseas Chinese Sports Association, the British Army's Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Japanese Sports Association, and other groups were contacted. However, due to funding issues, it was delayed for several months. Then, it coincided with China's National Games, the Japanese athletes' selection meet, and the Russians requested a postponement to wait for the triathlon champion Anfinov. This first sports meet was delayed until 1 PM this afternoon at Hongkou Park. Unfortunately, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders had already left Shanghai and could not participate.</p>
<p>This event was originally not limited to the participation of the above-mentioned three teams, but due to limited funding and crude scale, many parties were waiting to see. Therefore, only these few participated in the first event. It is hoped that starting from the next event, Chinese and Western groups can actively participate, expanding from three teams to six or seven teams, or even more than ten teams, to create a magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>The strongest supporters of this event are Mr. Shi Liangcai and Mr. Cheng Yize. Mr. Shi is responsible for the venue expenses, and Mr. Cheng generously made a large silver cup to present to the winning team. Whoever wins one event keeps it once, and whoever wins three consecutive events keeps it permanently. White Rainbow has elite soldiers and fierce generals, and is the strongest in strength, but it is heard that Cheng Jinguan, Zeng Rongzhong, Huang Shengbai, and Xu Yanbo will all be unable to attend due to other matters. The track and field situation seems to be tight, but with Zhang Jiakui's attendance in the field events, the momentum is immense. The main forces of the Japanese and Russian sides are also concentrated in the field events, so today's field event competition will definitely be exceptionally exciting.</p>
<p>The Russian general Anfinov's shot put has reached 14 meters, and the discus 42 meters, unrivaled in the Far East. The javelin is also more than 50 meters. Trubin's shot put exceeds 13 meters. These two are several times better than Shanghai's past champions Mutovkin. The Russian Overseas Chinese Sports Association has repeatedly telegraphed to urge them to come to Shanghai, and they may arrive today. The Japanese player Komatsu jumped 6.73 meters in the long jump last Sunday. Kuwazai's five miles is 26 minutes and 55 seconds. Based on this, the 10,000 meters is between 34 and 35 minutes. He is a strong rival to Xiaolievshenkov.</p>

It is learned that the association plans to start with ball team competitions to arouse the interest of the national products industry. Yesterday, it specially made a form and sent it to various factories to investigate the established ball teams in order to compile statistics and promote the universal organization of subordinate factories. The original letter is recorded as follows: It is noted that Mr. Sun Daosheng, Executive Committee Member and Director of the Publicity Department of this association, designed and organized the National Products Industry Sports Committee to promote amateur sports and forge the health of employees, guiding various factories to establish football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, and other teams, and to hold various competitions. The outstanding athletes of each team will be selected and mixed to form a national products football team, etc., to compete with the strong teams in Shanghai for the championship, thereby increasing the glory of the national products industry. This has been resolved by the first joint meeting of the 14th Executive and Supervisory Committees, and Mr. Sun, Director, has been publicly recommended to preside over the planning. Cheng Nianpeng, Gao Shiheng, Shen Guansheng, Xu Wengui, and Lin Guyun, five comrades, will assist in the progress. It is recorded. In addition to the regulations and designs made by Mr. Sun, etc., this factory has always been known for its enthusiastic promotion of sports, and its various ball teams are well-organized. Now, in order to compile statistics on the number of ball teams in national products factories, prepare schedules, so as to start the competition early, select and organize strong teams in various sports, participate in the Shanghai competition, and win the glorious championship, a survey form is enclosed accordingly. It is hoped that the established ball teams will be promptly filled out and returned within one week after the letter arrives.</p>
<h3>Mr. Song Fuxin Presides over Qingdao Sports</h3>
<p>Since Shen Honglie took over the Qingdao municipal administration, he has paid special attention to promoting sports.

Mayor Shen greatly relied on Mr. Hao and others. On the one hand, the Education Bureau changed the organization of the Sports Committee, and on the other hand, with the promotion of Mr. Shen, the Sports Promotion Association was established to recruit sports talents in Qingdao and jointly plan the development of sports. Both associations are responsible for and presided over by Mr. Hao. After a year of efforts, Qingdao's sports have shown a vigorous atmosphere. Recently, it was heard that Mr. Hao has been appointed as a sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education and left Qingdao for Beijing. All the tasks of the Director of Physical Education and all sports organizations in Qingdao will be taken over by Song Fuxin.</p>

<p>Autumn □ Special Issue Late Autumn □</p>
<h3>Late Autumn</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wang Mei</p>
<p>Just past the Double Ninth Festival, it is late autumn again.</p>
<p>The leaves of the梧桐 (wutong) tree are painted red, and the branches begin to tremble. The scenery is so desolate, and the emotions are so dim. Late autumn brings aging to people.</p>
<p>I wander alone in this forest. I want to find, to find my childhood that was lost not long ago. Here in spring, I see flowers, red and white, blooming on the ground and in my heart. Here in summer, there are green leaves, sparse and dense, shading the fields and my body. Around me is a warm wind, and above my head is a bright sun, but now, now only the stream still flows, flowing into the bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>No spring, no summer, and no childhood that I left behind!</p>
<p>What can I find? The wind is so bleak, the grass is so withered and yellow. My heart flies to the ground with the fallen leaves, rustling! I trample on the fallen leaves, and also trample on my heart!</p>
<p>The crows return to their nests with lonely voices. There is a touch of afterglow in the sky, which reminds me of two lines of poetry I saw not long ago: Across the colored desert sky.</p>
<p>One lone bird flight</p>
<p>Perhaps this is late autumn, how dreary and tasteless late autumn is!</p>
<h3>In the Season of Falling梧桐 (wutong) Leaves</h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>The sun has lost its previous violent heat, only redeeming a touch of pale yellow light. The autumn wind, a gust of sharp wind, blows with a howling sound, and it feels cold when it blows on the body, as if the cold air in the wind penetrates straight into the heart from the pores of the skin.</p>
<p>On the street, there are no longer women's crisscrossing jade legs, and at the same time, the thighs of ordinary, clumsy, and dark coolies are gradually disappearing among the crowds' hesitant footsteps. Autumn sales, woolen sales flags dance wildly in the wind above people's heads, sugar-roasted chestnuts, stir-fried hot白菓 (ginkgo nuts), crystal文丹 (mandarin oranges), Tianjin雅耳黎 (pears)... are arranged everywhere in front of people. Those friends sitting in the car, 丨丨 hiding their bodies in suits and loose robes, and those wrapping their snake-like bodies in coats, are all silently welcoming the approaching winter, 丨丨 because they or she needs to change the taste!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the common people who are being oppressed by the power of "dumping" must add the burden of "cold" to their shoulders; therefore, they must make a good deal with the longevity bank, 丨丨 continuously pawning summer clothes and exchanging winter clothes. The most miserable, of course, is the little urchin on the road. He has no loose robes or suits and coats, only a few broken burlap bags sewn together and wrapped around his flesh and blood. The broken burlap bags cannot block much of the cold wind, so he has to tear off the advertising paper on the wall to serve as temporary winter clothes, quilts, and hats. Otherwise, what better way is there? To rob? To peel pigs? Too dangerous! It's against the law. To steal? Not possible either. To commit suicide? Not worth it! I have the courage, but...</p>
<p>The autumn wind, a gust of sharp wind, blows with a howling sound, and it feels cold when it blows on the body, as if the cold air in the wind penetrates straight into the heart from the pores of the skin.</p>
<p>The洋梧桐 (sycamore) trees on both sides of the road also shed a few yellow leaves with the sound of the wind. Ah! Winter is coming! At the same time, the two different classes lurking in this world will reappear before our eyes, gradually, gradually, unfolding, expanding, and deepening!</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>The west wind is blowing harder and harder, and the earth is gradually getting colder. That's right, after the windy and rainy Double Ninth Festival, the weather is much colder than before.</p>
<p>Thin lined clothes, of course, can no longer resist the cold, so cotton clothes and flannel shirts have risen in response to the season. Of course, people with money have no worries. They just need to keep a few tailors busy, working day and night, to provide the ladies with a try of new clothes. The winter clothes of 1933, of course, have a new style.</p>
<p>Several摩豋密司 (tailors) are holding flannel work in their hands, working diligently wherever they are. They are also making winter clothes very quickly.</p>
<p>But when we think of the Yellow River breach and the communist areas, where eating often becomes a problem, how can they take care of that? Therefore, those places are getting colder and colder every day, and their hearts are also breaking more and more every day. The west wind is blowing harder, and there is no winter clothing. How pitiful!</p>
<p>The young mistresses of the city change their winter clothes once a year, as if last year's winter clothes can no longer be worn. They have to be sent to the wet nurses to wear. So many winter clothes are only worn for one winter.</p>
<p>I heard that in Shaanxi and Gansu, not to mention winter clothes, it is said that their trousers cannot be worn by everyone. Compared with the young mistresses of the city, it is really "the judgment of clouds and mud."</p>
<p>When the proletariat sees the west wind blowing, it makes them feel sad, because after the west wind rises, they have to find ways to make or redeem winter clothes from the longevity bank.</p>
<h3>Autumn Maples</h3>
<p>— Xie Jizuo</p>
<p>"Autumn maples are no ordinary color, half tears and half blood," what a sorrowful and heroic sentence this is!</p>
<p>Autumn deepens! The maple forests of Qixia Mountain and the red leaves of Linggu Temple, I have admired them in the past, always feeling they were just autumnal adornments. My heart never felt any great symbolism; year after year, I passed them by indifferently. Now, the maple leaves in both places are still extraordinarily red, but the pigment of the red seems to carry some tragic darkness. The blazing sun shines on the leaf surfaces, reflecting an even more terrifying color, as if each maple leaf could be compared to China today, as pitiful as its state under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>"Autumn maples are no ordinary color, half tears and half blood," the whole of China is no longer an ordinary sight, but truly "half tears and half blood!"</p>
<h3>After the West Wind Rises</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Gusts of west wind blew up clouds of dust from the street. On the street, pedestrians involuntarily hunched their shoulders. I came out from Avenue Road, and the street was covered with a layer of sycamore leaves. Some were yellow, some were red. Small leaves struck my head, and I burst out from the falling leaves and walked into the northwest wind.</p>
<p>Many very fashionable women wore fur-collared coats, strutting on the road as if they didn't see the sycamore leaves falling, as if they didn't know that the northwest wind had blown upon them. I was only wearing a very thin jacket. Exposed to the face of the wind, it had lost its effectiveness in resisting the cold, and I felt a shiver.</p>
<p>Before long, I reached Xinzha Road. I couldn't bear it anymore and prepared to take a tram back to put on more clothes. After walking a few more steps, I reached the tram stop, where I stood waiting for the tram. But the tram seemed to have slowed down in the cold wind and didn't come for a long time, so I stood there.</p>
<p>In the corner of the surrounding wall, there was a pawnshop. Below the iron handle shaped like a "ruyi" scepter hung the original plaque with the character "Pawn" (當). I couldn't help but shift my thoughts from taking the tram to the pawnshop. My thoughts were completely enveloped by the "Pawn" plaque, everything I had.</p>
<p>From here, I saw two people who seemed to be wearing only single layers of clothing running into the pawnshop. Inside the door, there was a screen with the character "Pawn" on it, obscuring all the internal secrets. I didn't know what was happening inside. From here, I could only see the small sign at the entrance fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Soon, a man wearing a tattered long gown came out from behind the screen, looked around, and held a package wrapped in blue cloth, as if he were a thief afraid of being seen. Looking from here, I met his eyes. Ah, wasn't that Mr. Wang from next door? I hadn't seen him since he moved. How had he gotten like this?</p>
<p>As I was wondering, Mr. Wang suddenly disappeared. Mr. Wang's son had set up a business in Zhabei, and all of his assets were in that business. But it was completely destroyed by artillery fire last time. His son returned empty-handed and unemployed. Six months ago, they moved because they were gradually becoming impoverished, and since then, I didn't know where they had gone.</p>
<p>The tram came. I forgot the cold I felt. I no longer wanted to go back to put on more clothes. A girl wearing a leather coat walked by, bringing a gust of west wind.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from a Journey to Wuxi 丨丨丨丨</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The waves are calm, the shore faces the mist. The great and small Jishan Mountains are idle all day long. Two or three fishing boats chase after the water. In the slanting sunlight, a pair of birds return together. Such a landscape is never tiresome to behold. In a place of wide leisure, let us lean on the railing. Do not ask about the vicissitudes of human affairs; entrust oneself to optimistic views of the vastness of Kanghai.</p>
<h3>Idle Gaze at Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>The lake is broad, embracing dragons as they hasten. The peaks are numerous, and the mountains are not lonely. The sound of the waves harmonizes with the intensity of the rain. The force of the water is driven by the wind. The region divides Wu and Yue. The mountain mists exist between presence and absence. How can West Lake compare? Its grandeur and beauty are altogether different. (Sheng Bai said that the wonder of Taihu lies in its grandeur and vastness, while West Lake is beautiful and delicate, seemingly incomparable.)</p>
<h3>Drunken Red Leaves</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Treading on autumn light, I arrived in Suzhou again. Suzhou is a place where I traveled before. I am already too lazy to listen to the bell of Hanshan Temple. Even if Mr. Yu Dafu sees the charm of "A sail in the rain passing Loumen" as very elegant, and how memorable it is to ride a donkey in the drizzle, slowly going along Qili Shantang to pay respects to Zhen Niang, my purpose for this trip is to see the red leaves of Tianping Mountain, so my lingering on the shores of Gusu Terrace seemed ordinary.</p>
<p>Indeed, taking advantage of the autumn twilight, when thick frost covers the shoulders of the maple leaves, ascending Tianping Mountain to see the mountains covered with red trees, no one would bear to leave. This is because the red maples have the allure of a fair lady in red makeup. And the posture of the sunset reflecting the red leaves, swaying in the bleak autumn wind, symbolizes the spirit of a warrior. Who among the wise would not marvel at the vibrant crimson that adorns a life filled with the dryness of autumn! An ancient poem says, "Stopping the carriage, I sit loving the maple forest at dusk; the frosted leaves are redder than the flowers of the second month." If not for a passionate person, who could say such moving words? Those who have not actually seen a forest of red leaves, who would know the greatness and sincerity of poetic meaning!</p>
<p>When we reached "A Thread of Sky," it was already late afternoon. The afternoon sunlight did not seem as spirited as in the morning, but precisely because of the dimness of the sunlight, the colors reflected on the clusters of red leaves were even more vibrant. "Ten Thousand Tablets Facing the Sky" originally had only emptiness and loneliness. The chaotic, bizarre rocks in the autumn with white dew and frost felt even more decayed and desolate. But because of the red trees on the cliffs, it felt as if a decadent old man had revived the joy of spring, uttering infinite melancholy. And the surrounding red maples, like intoxicated beauties, revealed the rosy blush of youth, charming nature. This painting, containing two kinds of emotions and vitality, already represents the two most successful and saddest stages of life. Even someone not prone to sentimentality cannot help but be moved to think of the joys and sorrows of life.</p>
<p>Autumn mountains and forests are originally full of the ashes of death. The rustling west wind, along with the whistling falling leaves, seems to be urging people to grow old. But in Tianping Mountain, there are blood-like red leaves to adorn the season of vanishing, allowing people to recapture the light of struggle from a declining state of mind. How magnificent is this power of incitement and enlightenment! Do red leaves exist simply to be sung by poets? While appreciating the red leaves, we must at least grasp the hints that the red leaves give us and move forward.</p>
<p>When we returned to the foot of the mountain, we saw a foreign woman sitting on the grass, painting. She was wearing light blue casual clothes, reflecting her white neck and hands. One look told you that she was someone who loved beauty very much. She gazed at the mountains and forests while contemplating and drawing. Looking at her draft, she had already sketched the outline of the mountain and evenly distributed the red leaves in appropriate places. Seeing her appreciation of the red leaves, we could at least determine that she was also a lover of red leaves.</p>
<p>The few red leaves I brought back, tucked in a book, were somewhat withered. I mourned their short lifespan and pondered for a long time.</p>

<h3>The Waning Autumn of Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>— Weizhong</p>
<p>It's Sunday, time to wander outside as usual. The weather is gloomy, but it's not raining. Hiding indoors would be even more boring. Lao Zhu and Ge proposed visiting Xuanwu Lake. We took a two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage with them at Xinjekou. On this wide pebble road, it was deserted, with few visitors! Autumn must be deep. The clip-clop of the horses' hooves echoed in the vast space, advancing with a steady rhythm.</p>
<p>Outside the city was a long embankment. We got out of the carriage and walked along the lake side.</p>
<p>Isn't this exactly the place that people yearn for as so-called historical sites and scenic spots? Yes, it is. Emperor Yuan of the Jin Dynasty practiced his naval fleet here. During the Yuanjia era of the Song Dynasty, a black dragon was seen here. Since ancient times, many poets and scholars have lingered here. But what about now? Even if you want to find a little bit of the remaining charm, it's almost impossible!</p>
<p>Passing Asia, wiping out Ge Bay, you reach America. The achievements of revolutionary construction are so amazing! Xuanwu Lake is no longer called Xuanwu Lake! It is said that "construction" has divided this place into the five continents of Asia, America, Europe, Africa, and Australia, calling it "Five Continents Park." Now, Xuanwu Lake has become a name in history.</p>
<p>America is the most outstanding place here, with the most modern structures, European and American-style houses, monuments that stand like ivory towers, flat sidewalks, patterned gardens, flowers everywhere, grass everywhere. It's a pity that it's not the time when a riot of colors compete in beauty and fragrance!</p>
<p>Zhongshan Hall, Yiyun Tower, and other places have also changed their appearance. The weather is cold, and people no longer need such cool places. A few tea servers are left, surrounding a square table, playing the game of chess.</p>
<p>The wind scrapes the water surface into layers of fish scales. Reflected by the faint sunlight, a few broken stems and remaining branches by the lake silently fell on the water.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Lao Ge shouted strangely in the bamboo forest over there. We hurried over. It turned out that he had discovered a kind of "bamboo pole literature" and was reading it with relish. Almost every bamboo pole here was engraved with tiny characters, from love affairs like "Ah Feng," "Yue," "Sister, I love you" to commemorative articles like "So-and-so visited here in such-and-such year and month," and even national affairs like "Resist Japan and save the country" and "Swear to recover lost territory." Almost everything was captured by these few bamboo poles. However, those who wrote "Resist Japan and save the country" accounted for less than one-tenth. Is it because the country is already peaceful and there is no need to resist Japan? Or are the friends who engraved the bamboo from another country?</p>
<p>Walking past, you reach Africa. Africa is not like America, with no modern buildings, no entire flower gardens, no entire grasslands, and no wide and flat sidewalks. America has been draped in the outer shell of 20th-century capitalism, while this place still fully preserves the prototype of a 15th and 16th-century agricultural society.</p>
<p>Clumps of artemisia and smartweed scattered randomly by the water, mixed with a few reeds with white heads. On the shore, bald mulberry trees and sparse bamboo hid one or two thatched huts. Strolling on this path overgrown with weeds, a kind of simple, natural, great, and mysterious power assailed the heart.</p>
<p>Further on, a very long embankment leads directly to Europe. A piece of withered and yellow weeds trembled in the west wind. Several cowherds and woodcutters bent over, hunching their backs, and crawled on the Australia surrounded by water. Several piles of broken walls and ruined tiles quietly collapsed nearby.</p>
<p>All of this scene was too desolate. Our poet, Lao Zhu, picked up a fallen leaf and wrote, "A desolate autumn heart," and casually threw it into the water. Slowly and slightly, it lay on the water surface, flowing and flowing, until a fallen lotus stem stopped it.</p>
<p>Desolation gnawed at the poet's heart, and Lao Zhu could no longer linger here! He urged us to go back, and on the long embankment we came to, we found the original carriage, climbed on, and the clip-clop of hooves spread the desolate mood of deep autumn in the empty and vast autumn sky.</p>
<p>Autumn is deep丨</p>

<h3>Securities: No. 19 Bond Exclusively Rises 1.2 Yuan; Other Bonds Improve 4-5 Jiao to 8-9 Jiao; Political Rumors Still Prevalent, Process Extremely Treacherous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to reports of eased tensions in Fujian, public sentiment was excited, and the trend seemed to have a turning point. Because most retail investors had shifted from bullish to bearish, but market rumors had not completely subsided. Apprehensions still sometimes struck the bullish side, causing significant market price fluctuations. The upward momentum lacked sustained power, indicating that bearish sentiment remained strong. The Fujian situation had been brewing for a long time without a declared resolution, suggesting internal complexities and a lack of consensus. The outcome depends on the authorities' handling of the situation. Yesterday morning, the market opened with very excited sentiment. Various factions frantically covered their short positions, with No. 4 and No. 21 bonds being heavily bought. However, these were mainly on behalf of clients, and retail investors followed suit. Various bond markets seemed poised for rapid gains, with most rising around 1 yuan. No. 20 bond rose 1.34 yuan. Although the price changes of subsequent bonds varied, due to previous day's drops and rises, the upward trend did not diminish. This showed the panic of the short sellers. It was expected that the second session would continue the upward trend. Unexpectedly, large investors suddenly sold, and No. 3, No. 5, No. 54, and No. 21 bonds were also dumped. The market price could not be sustained and reversed, falling 2-3 jiao to 4-5 jiao. Only No. 19 bond slightly improved by 2 jiao. The morning sessions ended at 2 PM. Therefore, the afternoon session was delayed until 4:30 PM and temporarily changed to one session. The trend remained small. Although evening news was chaotic, rumors still prevailed. The selling of No. 21 and No. 54 bonds was extremely aggressive. Fortunately, No. 42 and No. 46 bonds absorbed a large portion, otherwise, there would have been a significant drop. The leading bonds improved by 1-2 jiao, while the later ones improved by a small 2-3 jiao. Gold short rose as much as 8 jiao. The market price ultimately rose 4-5 jiao to 8-9 jiao. No. 19 bond, due to the urgent need of No. 4, rose exclusively by 1.2 yuan. The trend remains chaotic because the buying and selling sides are evenly matched, and the outcome is uncertain. The total transaction volume was 27,116,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot, 10,415,000 yuan in unified salt tax futures, 4,170,000 yuan in troop reduction bonds, 3,715,000 yuan in No. 19 bonds, and 4,820,000 yuan in No. 20 bonds.

<h3>New York Stock Market: Strong Then Weak</h3>
<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that on the 17th, the New York stock market initially strengthened due to the weakness of the US dollar. Later, as the US dollar rebounded, it turned weak again. Gold mining stocks fell sharply by several dollars due to profit-taking. The US dollar fluctuated throughout the day, with no fixed direction. Speculators shifted their focus from the stock market to foreign exchange. The strength of the US dollar was entirely due to unconfirmed rumors that the US government might limit capital exports. This report had been circulating for a long time, and it seemed to be true. However, according to experts, it was mostly psychological. Furthermore, reliable sources suggested that the government might stabilize the US dollar at its current level to instill confidence. The total stock trading volume for the day was 2,320,000 shares. "Wheat" trading was sluggish, falling 2 cents due to the influence of foreign exchange. News of the need for construction to restore confidence. "Cotton" fell 20 points due to the influence of foreign exchange, limited loss trading, and the recognition of the Soviet Union.

<p>20 Utility Stocks 23.21 Down 0.59</p>
<p>40 Bonds 78.80 Down 0.12</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: A Quiet Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market still has no distinction between gain and loss, and the market is extremely dispersed. After a certain association stabilized the yarn market, most speculators remained idle. As a result, trading has decreased daily, and the market presents a bleak and desolate scene. Generally speaking, the surrounding environment is poor, and all prices are declining, so the upward force is relatively lacking.</p>
<h3>Quiet Trading in Human Hair</h3>
<p>The human hair market opened with very little trading. There were many empty auctions, and the business hours were only 25 minutes, indicating the sluggishness of trading. Prices for each month fell by 1-2 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan gang had slightly bought 500 bales, and the market recovered, with prices for each month rising by 1-2 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 8,350 bales. The sellers included Yu Kang (500 bales), Chun Ji (950 bales), Heng Chang (350 bales), and Xin Hua (400 bales).

<p>Yunnan 280 Inland 175 Shantou 51 Wuhu 7</p>
<p>Sichuan 505 Fellow Traders 210</p>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon. American cotton trended down, and foreign exchange also contracted. The gold price rebounded, and the parity did not rise or fall, so public sentiment was calm. There were rumors of a squeeze in the current month, but in fact, it was extremely weak. Since credit was still tight and the current cotton price was relatively cheap, it was feared that it would be difficult to rise significantly even if a squeeze occurred.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hair: Difficult to Rise or Fall</h3>

<h3>Japanese Merchants Freely Purchase Spot Cotton in the US | Domestic Cotton Mills Have Less Demand |</h3>
<p>A cable from New York on November 17 reported on the cotton market situation of the week: There was no pressure to sell from the South, and the US dollar was weak again, which slightly aroused demand. At the same time, the uncertainty of the future of the US dollar and the impact of higher prices on consumer demand have limited speculative buying and caused quite turbulent fluctuations. Recent cotton prices have risen to more than one cent per pound, and Southern high-quality cotton has been sold slightly, but the basis of the price is very strong. It is heard that Japanese merchants are freely purchasing spot cotton in the southwest, and cotton merchants also have a lot of demand, but domestic cotton mills have less demand. After the price of raw cotton rose, the demand for cotton goods improved, but most buyers are still waiting and seeing. There is a saying that future cotton can be mortgaged at four cents per pound for withdrawal at any time, but there has been no concrete development. According to official sources, there are no plans to take any action on future cotton to avoid disrupting the market.</p>

<h3>Tax on Foreign Wheat and Flour Expected, Flour and Wheat Rise Sharply | Flour Up More Than Four Cents...Wheat Up More Than One Dime |</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was initially showing signs of leveling off as Northern traders found it too high after several days of sharp rises and were less eager to buy. However, yesterday's news reported that the decision to tax foreign wheat had been made. This measure is inevitable and will definitely be implemented within the next one or two months. Therefore, the formal order may be issued soon. Due to this news, the market turned sharply upward. Although the price of foreign wheat was reported to be down 3, 4, 5, or 6 cents, and demand was particularly weak, the flour market rose step by step. Distant months were especially popular in the afternoon. Although the price of foreign wheat was reported to be down, there were no confirmed orders. However, Fuxin Factory again traded government-owned American wheat at a ship price of 4.25 yuan, and did not cover its position after taking delivery. Therefore, the closing price was up 4.5 cents for the second month, 4.25 cents for the third month, 4.75 cents for the fourth month, 3.25 cents for January, 1.25 cents for the current month, and 1.75 cents for February.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market rose across the board after the market opened because of reports of import duties on foreign wheat. Calculated as a percentage, wheat was up 5 jiao and flour was up 37.5 cents. It was difficult to place orders for foreign wheat today, the cost increased, and domestic supplies were insufficient. Therefore, public sentiment was very positive. All months rose in unison, and distant months soared even more in the afternoon due to the tax issue. The closing price was up as much as 14 cents for April, 12 cents for March, and 11 cents for February. Recent months also followed suit, with the current month and January up 2 cents each, and December up 4 cents. Spot wheat continued to rise, with Middle Gate up another 5 cents. The highest price was not opened. Yao Bay wheat was opened at 4.1 yuan, and Qin Tong Ming Guang Tang City was all at 4.045 yuan. Changshu was at 4 yuan. Fuxin took 4,200 bags, and Fufeng took 500 bags.</p>
<h3>River Down Rice Market: Stable with a Hint of Weakness</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) The supply continues to pour in, with more than 70 boats arriving at the docks, carrying a total of 8,000-9,000 shi, of which late rice accounts for about 40 boats, totaling 5,000-6,000 shi. Fortunately, the customer gangs also actively purchased more than 5,000 bags, totaling 6,000-7,000 shi, and the market has stabilized. However, due to today being Sunday, there is bound to be some impact, and the market is slightly weaker after that. In general, the situation is stable with a hint of weakness. The Chang gang, Su Tong gang, and Nan Gang, etc., have a good initial market for Japonica and Du Yang Jian, but it suddenly turned stagnant later, resulting in both arrival and sales being abundant, and the market situation is only average. Except for Bian Yuan, there is still no distinction between gain and loss.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 48-49 boats from various routes downstream. The prices of various types of rice in the market have slightly decreased. The prices of early rice, thin rice, and Yin Yuan have stabilized. Du Bu Customer Tips is flat and weak, and Bai Yuan is slightly lower by a few cents.</p>
<h3>Customer Rice Slightly Dull, Returns to Flat ▲Foreign Rice Tax Resolved, Public Sentiment Optimistic▲</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer rice was dull again, and there were also wagonloads of goods arriving, and the road could arrive at the port in a short time. The supply was greater than the demand, and the market returned to flat. However, it has been decided to slightly levy a special tax on foreign rice. There are more than 220,000 bags of foreign rice in the market, and they are unwilling to easily sell them. Although the sales of customer rice were sluggish yesterday, the price of foreign rice was shouted higher by nearly a dime due to the tax, so there were no transactions of foreign rice. Although the sales of customer rice were weak, the price also held steady and did not fall. Throughout the day, 44 bags of Hunan machine red rice were bought from Fuzhou at a price of 7.4 yuan, 410 bags of Hunan machine Jing were bought from Quanzhou at a price of 7.35 yuan, 497 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were bought at a price of 7.83 yuan to 7.7 yuan, and 100 bags of Wuxi machine Yuan rice were bought from this street at a price of 8.5 yuan. The market price was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Raw Peanuts: Rebound After Falling</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts have fallen sharply repeatedly. Until it fell close to six yuan, it attracted a lot of buyers, such as Little Luzon, Guangdong gang, Shantou, and oil factories, all of which started purchasing. Therefore, its stock has already been sold through (about a hundred tons of Chen goods). The market price has also risen by more than half a yuan compared to the low price. The supply is scarce because the price at the place of origin is high, resulting in fewer wagonloads. Most of the goods from Guangdong gang are self-transported, so the recent market situation is quite stable. However, it is rumored in the market that a large batch will arrive soon. Yesterday, 40 tons of Xuzhou goods were opened at a price of 6.4 yuan per piece, and more than a dozen bags of Tancheng goods were opened at a price of 6.82 yuan, all of which were taken by oil factory parties. There are Shantou, Ningbo, inland, etc. searching for peanut destinations, so the market situation is quite brisk. Yesterday, the total market transaction was about 1,500 bags.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Falls Sharply, Silk Sales More Stagnant</p>
<h3>No One Asks About Autumn Dried Cocoons</h3>
<p>White fabrics have plummeted in sales to Europe and the United States. Raw silk prices have fallen sharply. The Shanghai silk factories have abundant stocks of raw silk, and their funds are stagnant. They cannot afford to support themselves, and they have reduced labor and stopped machines one after another. There is no need for raw silk materials. The dried cocoon market is becoming more and more sluggish. The cocoons stored in the hands of general residual cocoon customers have reached a point where no one asks about them. Yesterday, 520 catties of autumn dried cocoons were opened by the guild at a reeling discount price of only 103 yuan. The net cocoons were originally only pulling a little over 600 yuan per 100 catties of silk, but it was still a situation of having a market but no sales. This is because the current overseas price of B-grade white fabrics is only a little over 500 yuan to the US, and 623 yuan to England and France. If you add another 1560 yuan for reeling, etc., then the factory will have to lose more than 200 yuan per package. The cocoon market is becoming more and more lifeless.</p>
<h3>Yili Raw Silk Continues to Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The printing and sales of the inferior Yili dried silk are still not lonely, so the source is not weak. Yesterday, the inland river steamer also loaded 58 pieces of white dried silk from Xun and Zhen ports, all of which were inferior grades.</p>
<h3>Top-Grade Rayon Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Shanghai Maru exported 50 tons of top-grade rayon with brands such as Babao Tu and Queen yesterday morning to Japan. It is said that it was purchased by a certain silk factory in Osaka, produced by Tianyou Foreign Firm.</p>
<h3>Difficult for Silk Sales in Europe and the United States to Turn Around</h3>
<p>The US Treasury Secretary resigned, and inflation is expected to be realized, but the international news is bad, and the economy is unstable. The New York raw silk market price rebounded slightly. However, the Yokohama raw silk fell miserably and endlessly. There is still no hope for a turnaround in silk sales. The Shanghai silk market is still stagnant. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others entered 15 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, 8 packages of yellow coarse silk, and 7 packages of white dried silk. The price was still flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Slightly Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea from both the foreign merchant tea market and the local merchant tea market, Yihe Xiehe Yongxing and other firms, had slightly improved purchases. A small number of needles and Xiumei items were also purchased by Tianxiang Foreign Firm. The total number of green teas sold in the city was 320 boxes. The selling price has not changed much. In addition, the local green teas purchased by various foreign firms, such as Xiehe Jinlong Fushi and other firms, have notified various tea warehouses to deliver and prepare to pack and export due to the need for foreign telegrams.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Longan Still Difficult to Form a Market</h3>
<p>The new longan of various routes has not formed a market due to the unsuitable market price, and the merchants and the firms have insisted on their own opinions for a long time. However, the actual sales aspect is also different from previous years. The clearance of new goods is extremely rare. Therefore, after a long insistence, it is still difficult to approach, resulting in a deadlock. Recently, there are still a lot of Chen goods transactions. The common large blister rounds are priced at 46-47 yuan, the Chinese style is 27-28 yuan, and the small style is 20 yuan to 18-19 yuan, depending on the price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White: No Transactions in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had no loading or unloading due to today being Sunday, and there were still few imports and exports. However, the market price seems to have reached a considerable level at this point. According to the observations of people in the industry, there will not be much further decline in the future. If sales increase, there is a possibility of a rebound. The guild priced the common grade of 24 coarse sand white at 20.2 yuan, but there were no transactions. Dutch Red BDA Mark was priced at 15.62 cents, and a few transactions were made. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced up 5 cents to 20.6 yuan, but it did not form a market. Zhonghua cotton white original price was slightly opened, with the expected price of 19.2 yuan, No. 1 at 19 yuan, No. 2 at 18.8 yuan, No. 3 at 18.6 yuan, and No. 4 at 18.4 yuan. Chao Gang stores opened dozens of bags of Gao Long Port Green at 14.7 yuan.</p>

<h3>New Facial Masks</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>It is said that influenced by the trend, the dramas on the literary stage have been changing one after another. Although the roles remain the same, the facial masks are brand new.</p>
<p>Those who used to play the roles of rich men and gentlemen now have to put on a sad face, twisting their noses and crying about poverty; those who used to play shrewish women and promiscuous women in triangle plays now also wear a serious face and play the role of the main male character in a cross-dressing performance. White-faced actors go back to the backstage to apply even whiter powder, and soon come on stage again; green-faced and fanged actors put on an unnatural smile, winking at the audience. All these, all these, are new, brand new.</p>
<p>Although old dramas still exist, they are newly decorated. Xue Pinggui recruits a son-in-law in the Western Liang, and Luo Hongxun sets up a ring in Yangzhou. In the past, they were martial arts dramas, but now they are performed by effeminate young male actors. But they can still use knives, spears, release hidden arrows, and challenge in a strange and exaggerated manner, cooing and whimpering.</p>
<p>So the audience cheered.</p>
<p>The facial masks are becoming more and more bizarre. Red, white, black, gilded: competing with each other, pulling and fighting fiercely, losing, going to repaint one and coming again. The last ones are foreign facial masks, with high noses and blue eyes, walking with straight legs, humming foreign Four Books and foreign Book of Rites in their mouths. If you don't believe it, please eat foreign fiery eyes. If you still don't believe it, airplanes, tanks, and rifles.</p>
<p>So the audience cheered again.</p>
<p>But facial masks also have other wonderful uses. The last time Xiao came to Shanghai, the literary people of Shanghai gave him a set of newly invented small facial mask models, and they were also stored in a box. Xiao happily took them away. It can be seen that facial masks can also be given to celebrities as gifts, asking celebrities to take them abroad to sow seeds, in order to be immortalized.</p>
<p>This is naturally limited to domestic products, and must be "newly invented."</p>
<h3>Nobel Prize for Literature and the Vanquished</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was talking about the Nobel Prize for Literature with an editor of a magazine, and then made a little joke, saying:</p>
<p>丨丨Will your esteemed magazine publish a "Manchurian Literature Special Issue"?</p>
<p>丨丨Then, you will be the greatest writer. Secondly, there is also Li Huiying, he said with a smile.</p>
<p>丨丨There is also Yang Hui. We are considered the "three great literary figures" of "Manchuria." I smiled as I said this.</p>
<p>This is a joke. But it aroused my infinite sadness and many questions.</p>
<p>It is said that this year's Nobel Prize winner, Pu Ning, is an "exile" who now lives in Paris. I feel that my situation has something in common with his. Although, I dare not nail the honorary title of "exile" to my head, but since the "September 18th Incident," I have been a "vanquished person." Moreover, Pu Ning lives in Paris in the West, and I live in Paris in the East. This time, Pu Ning won the prize, and I feel like I have also gained a little bit of glory. The Nobel Prize Committee can at least look up to the "vanquished."</p>
<p>The old Indian Tagore won a prize once. He is also a "vanquished person," because he lives in India, so we did not realize that he had the sadness of "vanquishing." So we also did not see how highly the Nobel Prize Committee valued him. However, this time, giving the prize to Pu Ning is indeed a "different look" from the committee members.</p>
<p>I think that in the future, if the committee members continue to follow this principle of "caring for" the "vanquished," then the "vanquished" will also have a way out. Not only will they be knighted, but they can also make a fortune. Gaining both fame and fortune, wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? If American black writers and African black writers have won awards, and in the end, it is "Manchuria's" turn, no matter which of our "three great literary figures" is knighted, I can always make a lot of money. Although I won't be promoted, I can still get rich. At that time, at least, I can eat a little more beef. Because we are all good friends, whether Yang Hui is knighted or Li Huiying receives the prize, I can always get a little bit of the gravy.</p>
<p>However, Pu Ning doesn't seem to be a very remarkable writer. Kuprin, a well-known Kuprin, doesn't seem to have been knighted. If you ask if there are any great writers in the world who have not been knighted, isn't there André Gide in France? There is still Gorky in Russia. However, not giving it to Gide or Gorky, but giving it to Pu Ning, proves that the Prize Committee is not judging people by their works, but by their status. Then, aren't the "three great literary figures" of "Manchuria" even more hopeful?</p>
<p>What is strange is that since Tagore was knighted, other writers who have lost their country but have not become "exiles" have not won the prize. Last year, the Nobel Prize was given to the American Lewis, and none of the black slave writers, such as Hughes, received the prize. What is going on? If it is not based on the value of the works, then the treatment of "vanquished" people is unequal.</p>
<p>But why is the treatment of "vanquished" people different? "Vanquishing" is "vanquishing" everywhere. It is probably because the ways of "vanquishing" are different, and the natures of "vanquishing" are different. In that case, the "three great literary figures of Manchuria" can also give up hope.</p>
<p>It is feared that "vanquished people" like us cannot be sympathized with by the Nobel Prize Committee.</p>
<h3>Lodging House</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>The sun was about to set. Wang Er, melancholically lost in thought, sat on the doorstep, striking a flint to light his pipe.</p>
<p>A dilapidated, dark, and damp small house had just been whitewashed with lime. The four crooked black characters "Accommodation for Merchants" were written on the whitewashed wall above the door. Inside, the wooden walls and pillars were also whitewashed, trying to conceal the dilapidated and filthy flaws of the small house. Wang Er had repaired this broken house to revitalize his business. He borrowed some money, added some secondhand cotton wadding and secondhand bedsheets from a used clothing store, and hired a carpenter to repair the rickety or almost dismantled bed frames. Because he wanted to increase the lodging fee from twelve copper coins a night to twenty copper coins. However, since then, fewer and fewer lodgers had stepped over his threshold. Even the few regular customers had switched to other lodging houses.</p>
<p>Whenever the sun set, he sat melancholically lost in thought on the doorstep. In front of him was an official road leading to a city fifty miles away. Some people had bought goods from the city, carrying wicker baskets and sacks full of cloth... Some, with shoulder poles bearing heavy loads, had their backs bent, panting like oxen; some walked with a limp. Everyone needed to rest, but they all did not stop their forward steps.</p>
<p>"It's getting late, stay here!"</p>
<p>Wang Er sat on the doorstep, flashing a smiling face to everyone who passed by.</p>
<p>"It's not completely dark yet, we can still see the road!"</p>
<p>In this way, those who knew him, returned him a bitter smile and passed on.</p>
<p>If Wang Er saw people carrying heavy burdens, with frustrated expressions on their faces, he would change his tone and say to them with great sympathy:</p>
<p>"Ah, friend, you're carrying such a heavy load... so heavy... probably two hundred catties... don't push yourself too hard, rest, sit down..." As soon as someone took a breath, they rested. The first thing they said was:</p>
<p>"The city is conscripting soldiers again... two thousand of them... tens of thousands of soldiers..."</p>
<p>As soon as the speaker said this with a serious face, many people would come to listen.</p>
<p>"I heard that people wearing long gowns aren't being conscripted. People who wear long gowns have it easy in this world... Villagers who heard the news are afraid to enter the city and are fleeing back halfway. There's no business in the city either. If villagers don't enter the city, what will the city people eat? City people are also having bad luck these days..."</p>
<p>As the conversation lengthened, they asked each other and talked about: rebellion, war, soldiers and bandits clashing, famine, cannibalism...</p>
<p>The passersby stood up, looked at the sky, the evening colors were hazy, night was approaching,</p>
<p>"Goodbye, boss!"</p>
<p>"Stay here! I have new cotton wadding and new straw mats... It's getting dark, stay here..."</p>
<p>However, Wang Er could not keep the customers. "New cotton wadding" and "new straw mats" could not entice them anymore.</p>
<p>In the evening, the lodging house that had once been revitalized had not a single lodger.</p>
<p>Wang Er said to his wife:</p>
<p>"These days, very few small businesses come and go; cattle dealers, tea merchants, fortune-telling blind men are also fewer; those who sell fake medicine, those who want to perform magic tricks, those who exchange chicken feather candy, they all stay in temples and ancestral halls, not in lodging houses..."</p>
<p>"Then why did you borrow money to repair the house and add cotton wadding..."</p>
<p>His wife spoke with a questioning tone. Wang Er had nothing to answer, only turned his head and sighed deeply.</p>
<h3>On "Flower Drum Opera"</h3>
<p>— Ye Dejun</p>
<p>Mr. He Ru’s three articles on "The Origin of Flower Drum Opera" cite numerous books and claim that Flower Drum Opera originated from the "Yagu Opera" and "Daya Hu" of the Song Dynasty, because the sounds of the three are similar and the events are similar, so they are three names for the same thing.</p>
<p>In addition to Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Records" and Yunlu Manchao's records of the customs of Daya Hu, Wu Zimu's "Dream Liang Records" also has the same record, ending by saying: "It also means to drive away evil spirits." This is clearly a ritual of the great exorcism at the end of the year to drive away plague ghosts. Later, beggars played the story of Zhong Kui exorcising ghosts at this time to collect money. Huang Shi's "A Study of the Great Exorcism at the End of the Year" cites the Fuzhou Gazetteer, saying: "At the end of the year, the villagers perform exorcism. It has existed since ancient times. Now, the people of the state regard it as Daya Hu..." The customs of Fuzhou are precisely a continuation of the Song Dynasty's legacy. We can certainly consider Daya Hu as a kind of entertainment, but it is an old custom of the great exorcism, while playing the flower drum is, on the one hand, a livelihood for the Fengyang people who wander the streets and perform arts, and on the other hand, the audience regards it as purely entertainment. Regardless of whether Daya Hu has lyrics or not, its lyrics and the lyrics of the flower drum are definitely different. Even if there are, they are only about exorcising ghosts, while the flower drum songs are, as Tong Fumin said, "mostly lewd words." The roles in the flower drum opera... From these points of view, Daya Hu and playing the flower drum are not the same thing. The similarity between the two is that they are both means of livelihood for the poor. Since the events are not similar, the similarity of the sounds is even more unreliable. Regarding the saying that it originated from Yagu, the author has already said that "it is not easy to determine." If it is said that Yagu began with Prince Zichun, it does not match the wild art of Flower Drum Opera, and the two are also not the same thing. In short, the theory that Flower Drum Opera predates Zaju and Chuanqi is doubtful. I feel that its origin is close to the period of Peking Opera. If it had existed earlier, it would have become orthodox like Peking Opera, but although its power in folk dissemination is very large, it is still immature, which is precisely the form of wild art that has not transformed into orthodoxy.</p>
<p>I think its origin is that there were lyrics for playing the flower drum first, such as "The painted flower drum has round heads..." which is sung while playing the flower drum; then there was Flower Drum Opera, and what it performed was about playing the flower drum, such as the Peking Opera's "Playing the Flower Drum" and Hunan's "Wang San Sells Milk." In my hometown, whenever there is a welcoming god festival, there must be one or two Flower Drum troupes before the main event. Each troupe has seven or eight to a dozen people, and what they perform is nothing more than ordinary stories, but there is no playing of the flower drum. Each person does not tie five or six feet long wooden sticks to their feet, and they only walk back and forth when performing, which is a silent drama without lyrics. As for those who use seven or eight feet long wooden sticks, they are not called Flower Drum troupes, but are called "Stilt Walking." Judging from its name, it has some connection with playing the flower drum. This is another transformation of it.</p>
<p>He Ru's comment: Daya Hu also means to drive away evil spirits. Wu Zimu's words are correct, but he did not say that this is what is called exorcism in ancient times, because it is still different from exorcism. But if you consider exorcism as Daya Hu's predecessor, it is certainly acceptable, just as I consider Daya Hu as Flower Drum's predecessor. In fact, what I said about the relationship between Flower Drum Opera and Daya Hu Yagu is still from the closest point of view. If we trace it back to its distant source, it would not be limited to discussing shamanic dances and the great exorcism. However, the establishment of an art takes the essence and uses it broadly, intricately and complexly. If you insist on seeking it in one way, a historian with common sense would probably not do so. What I mean by originating from something is a more modest and hypothetical way of speaking, as a theory for imagination. What does Mr. Ye think of my humble opinion?</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (33)</h3>
<p>— Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>It is true that Mrs. Lu Zuimi's intelligence was limited, but she had the touch, smell, and subtle senses of women. However, she had never suspected this. She had generously raised her glass to bless Maraisha's soul in heaven. If she had had any suspicion, she would never have done that. Now he no longer doubted. The unconscious dissatisfaction with the wealth that had fallen on his younger brother and the love for his mother undoubtedly inspired his prudence, a commendable, filial, and yet somewhat exaggerated prudence.</p>
<p>When he came to this conclusion, he felt satisfied as if he had done a good deed. He decided to be kind to everyone, first to his father, because his father's muddled judgments, vulgar opinions, and overly conspicuous ordinariness often made him angry.</p>
<p>He was not late for lunch, and with his wit and cheerful mood, he made the whole family happy. His mother was very happy and said to him:</p>
<p>"My Pierre, you don't know how mischievous and interesting you are when you're happy."</p>
<p>He spoke eloquently, using strange words to describe their friends vividly, making everyone laugh. Bo Qiru was made the target of his ridicule, and Mrs. Lu Zuimi was also teased a few times, but he spoke with measure, joking without being cruel. He looked at his younger brother and thought to himself, "You fool, come and defend her; it's useless for you to be rich, I will suppress you when I'm happy."</p>
<p>While drinking coffee, he said to his father:</p>
<p>"Are you using the 'Pearl' today?"</p>
<p>"No, my child."</p>
<p>"Can I go have fun with Ginba on it?"</p>
<p>"Of course, you can go as much as you want."</p>
<p>He bought a good cigar at the first tobacco shop he came to and then walked happily to the pier.</p>
<p>He looked at the bright, shining, light blue sky, which seemed cool after being swept by the sea breeze.</p>
<p>The sailor Papagri, nicknamed Ginba, was dozing in the boat. When Roland didn't go fishing in the morning, Papagri had to prepare the boat for sailing at noon every day.</p>
<p>"We two are going, captain!" Pierre called.</p>
<p>He ran down the iron ladder on the river bank and jumped onto the small boat.</p>
<p>"What wind?" he said.</p>
<p>"The gentle southerly wind, Mr. Pierre. The wind on the sea is very good today."</p>
<p>"Then, old man, let's go."</p>

<p>Amateur Discussions</p>
<h3>Ideal and Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>Recently, I often talked with the students of the supplementary school of this newspaper office, and heard many interesting discussions. The scope of these opinions is very broad, ranging from the country's internal affairs and diplomacy to personal life and ideals, all of which are fully expressed. However, comparatively speaking, most people pay more attention to personal issues, and very few opinions are put forward on general political and social issues. The reason for this is not that the current national crisis and social chaos are not enough to attract their attention, but that some people feel that their words are insignificant and that thinking too much will only increase their troubles and will not be of any practical benefit. Some people feel that people in the government have no way to solve the problem, so we people with little knowledge and experience naturally have no way to solve it. Still others have never thought about these issues at all, because they lost their education in the countryside in their childhood and came to Shanghai to live the life of an apprentice. In addition to working hard all day long, they have to be busy with self-study work if they have any spare time, so how can they have time to pay attention to national affairs? Some people say that the Chinese people's national concept is very weak, but judging from the above facts, the so-called lack of attention to national affairs by the people is not due to any innate nature, but is actually caused by the living environment. Therefore, what the reporter encourages and exhorts to these students is that under these different living environments, we all have different degrees of national concepts, which are difficult to unify. However, at least we should have an ideal in our personal lives as a goal for our work, career, and struggle. Otherwise, our lives will inevitably fall into a boring and meaningless state.</p>
<p>When it comes to ideals, they are absolutely different from fantasies. An ideal is a planned attempt based on the existing environment and one's own interests and abilities, while a fantasy is a lucky illusion that is not based on facts and has little possibility of being realized. For example, if a person has an ideal of becoming a chemist, then this person must usually be interested in chemistry, and must have a planned effort in the research of chemical theories and the exploration of experiments. Only in this way can it be called an ideal. If a person has no interest in chemistry, nor a plan for step-by-step research, nor the spirit of tireless experimentation, and wants to become a chemist, then it is a fantasy, a delusion, and is as absurd as the current group of people who hope to win a huge prize of 500,000 with ten yuan.</p>
<p>We know that fantasies are illusory and lucky, and carry a little mystery, while ideals rely on long-term practical efforts and struggles, and cannot be achieved overnight. Ideals have the demand for striving forward, while fantasies are mostly absurd thoughts after frustration and disappointment. We deeply feel that there are far more people with fantasies than people with ideals in today's society, which is enough to indicate that the entire society has entered a state of frustration and disappointment. So how should we save the decline of this society? This is of course not a question that can be answered in a few words, but in summary, it can be said like this: We should not fantasize, but establish an ideal. We should not be disappointed by the darkness of this society. We should deeply realize that there is light when there is an ideal, and there is life when there is an ideal. Our ideal is the vitality of society.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Returning to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Ding Boping</p>
<p>(Farmer) I used to work in a factory in Shanghai. Because I had several illnesses and because of my mother's death, I owed three hundred yuan in debt. The interest on each yuan was four hundred wen per month. Before, I could use my wages as interest. Later, because the factory's production was surplus and its business was stagnant, my wages and working hours were reduced. Therefore, I could not pay the interest, and my life became dangerous. Even if I asked the capitalists to restore my wages, the factory also paid close attention to me, so I could not stand firm.</p>
<p>Last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, creditors came to my door almost every day, forcing me to run around like a stray dog, without any way out. In desperation, I fled to my cousin's house in the countryside in the late spring and early summer of this year. I entered that short and dark grass house with poor ventilation and ate a bowl of tea brewed in a pottery pot, which had a smoky smell. This was exactly the busy season for farming. The farmers were planting rice seedlings in the deep paddy fields, working so hard that they were covered in mud and sweat, without a moment's rest. Women also had to draw water under the scorching sun. When the sun set in the west, my cousin's parents returned from the fields for dinner. I remember eating egg soup, tofu dregs, celery, and stinky pickled cabbage, which was considered the number one dish to treat guests in the countryside. Her father had to get up early tomorrow, so he went to sleep after eating. As a rule, they would go to sleep as soon as it got dark. Almost all the villagers ate three meals a day, two meals of rice and one meal of porridge. Some also ate one meal of wheat rice, one meal of rice, and one meal of porridge. Breakfast time was around 7 o'clock, lunch time was marked by the sun being in the middle of the sky, and dinner was eaten when it was dark. After eating, there was nothing else to do besides sleeping.</p>
<p>From that day on, her family had to make some countryside snacks for me every day, and add some eggs and tofu for me when I ate. Such preferential treatment really made me feel uneasy, and the idea of "those who eat must work, and those who do not work should not eat" inevitably arose in my mind. So I decided to go to the fields the next day to help them work. It happened that the rice paddies were weeding these days. I borrowed a grass knife and a very large wide-brimmed straw hat from the neighbor. The next day, I woke up when the sky was about to dawn, changed my clothes, rolled up my trouser legs, took off my shoes and socks, and took the grass knife and straw hat and set off with her father. When we arrived at the rice paddy, they went down into the field, and I also went down into the field in their manner. The coolness of the mud and water penetrated my heart. I lowered my head and bent my back, and it took me a long time to take a step. Before weeding, each rice paddy had been fertilized to help the rice seedlings grow. The field I was weeding was very large, and the fertilizer was applied very heavily, which smelled terrible. When I used more force in the water, the fertilizer water often invaded my mouth or face. In addition, the friction of the rice seedlings made my arms red. The heat of the sky, the steam of the water, and the stench of the fertilizer were really unbearable. It was almost as hard as this for more than ten days. At first, it was just a moment of excitement, but later it was hard to refuse to do it. The skin on my arms and back peeled off, and I was as black as a Red Head A San (derogatory term for Indians). I also lost weight, and it was more strenuous than in the factory. The temperature was over one hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit, and the rice paddies were short of water. The farmers everywhere were busy drawing water day and night. Sometimes I also helped to move the waterwheels, and it took a lot of effort to turn these waterwheels. After drawing water for a few days, the sky still didn't rain. None of the villagers didn't say, "Good Bodhisattva, God gives us food, please give us some rain! Otherwise, there will be no harvest this year." They were extremely superstitious, so the elders in the village discussed asking for rain, and carried out the "Dragon God Bodhisattva" in the village temple for a parade. The nearby villagers all carried the old and the young, carrying hoes, burning incense, beating gongs, and lighting firecrackers to pray that the "Dragon God Bodhisattva" would bestow rain. At that time, infinite sorrow was aroused in my heart. Ah! Drought is a warning that the village panic is about to come! I, who was driven from the city's recession to the countryside, where will I find a place to return in the future?</p>

<h3>Pan Yangyao on Revolutionary Occupations</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Zhu Yuxiang</p>
<p>Technical nature As the saying goes, "Accumulating wealth of thousands is not as good as having a skill." For example, the poor people in the Jiangbei area make various small toys for children out of paper pulp, bamboo strips, and wood scraps, and sell them on the streets, which can also be used to make a living. Another example is in Hangzhou, there is a person nicknamed "Little Monkey". He is famous throughout the city for making small monkeys specifically for children to play with. He makes a decent living, and has accumulated some savings over the years, enough to keep him warm and fed. From this, it can be seen that the close relationship between technology and occupation cannot be separated. The year before last, after Mr. Zhang Gongquan returned from inspecting industries in Japan, he wanted to visit factories in our country. It happened that I also had this intention, so we went together. We specifically visited many yarn factories and asked why the Chinese yarn industry has been declining to such an extent recently. The person in charge of the factory replied that this is partly a technical problem. It is said that a yarn factory in Japan with 10,000 spindles only needs to hire 250 workers. But in China, even Shenxin needs to hire 350 workers to do the job. Other smaller factories often need to hire 400 to 500 workers, and a yarn factory in Zhengzhou, Henan, even needs to hire as many as 600 workers. The same production volume, but the number of workers employed differs so much. The number of workers increases, and the wages increase accordingly, so the cost is also high. How can we compete with Japanese goods? No wonder we are doomed to failure! In Japanese yarn factories, each worker can manage up to 37 spinning machines, while Chinese workers can only manage about 20 machines at most. Currently, the market price of Japanese yarn is 24 yuan per piece, while Chinese yarn, even Shenxin's, has to sell for 36 yuan per piece, and it is already very difficult. Other factories have to sell for 40 yuan per piece to maintain costs. Everyone, think about it, if we don't start from the root and actively make occupations technical, so as to compete with foreigners, no matter how much we boycott Japanese goods, it will be of no avail. Who doesn't want to buy cheap goods? Who cares whether it is Japanese or domestic?</p>
<p>Creativity Chinese people like to eat ready-made meals and are always unwilling to put in any effort to create. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, my brothers, Mr. Jiang Wenyu, Mr. Yang Weiyu, and Dr. Liu Zhanen, the current president of Shanghai University, and others initiated the establishment of a vocational guidance center. It has been six years now and has achieved some results. Every day, there are always more than 20 or 30 young people who come to the center to ask for job introductions. According to statistics, about 7,000 or 8,000 people have been successfully introduced by our center, which can be regarded as a small contribution to society. Among the young people we come into contact with every day, the level of education varies. Some have just graduated from elementary school and want to find a job. Some are high school graduates, and some are college graduates, and even some have returned from studying abroad. Often, many young people ask me to introduce them to work in banks, as if this is the only occupation in their ideal. However, I always advise them not to just eat ready-made meals, but to do what others have not done. One day, a young man who graduated from the mechanical engineering department of a university came to me to introduce him to a job. I casually picked up a pen holder on my desk and asked him if he could manufacture this, because almost all of the ones sold on the market are foreign goods. He thought it made sense, so he actively proceeded and raised 5,000 yuan of capital. Now he has opened a small factory to manufacture, and there may be hope in the future. Last year, my brothers and I founded a "China Credit Investigation Office" because we felt that there was a real need for it in society. At that time, the scale was very small, with only five or six staff members. The speed of progress in the past year has been beyond expectations. Due to the sharp increase in affairs, the number of staff members has been increased to 40 or 50, and there are also more than 20 basic members. There are as many as 70 or 80 foreign merchant companies and others who entrust credit investigation. It can be seen that engaging in this kind of business is more meaningful and hopeful than sitting around and eating ready-made meals and sticking to old businesses!</p>

<h3>Young, Away from Home, Old Coming Back – (Women's Prison)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Li Xiaoqin</p>
<p>In a year of calamity and a month of misfortune, I, a humble shop assistant, was arrested and imprisoned in January of the 17th year of the Republic of China due to a certain case, and only regained my freedom in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Now, I will truthfully recount my personal experiences of prison life, dividing it into four categories: clothing, food, hygiene, and work, as follows. However, since I am a female prisoner, my description will be particularly detailed regarding the women's prison. However, I believe that the conditions in the men's prison can only be worse than in the women's prison, and not better, because: first, this has been the custom in China throughout history; second, the women's prison is relatively free from overcrowding; third, female prisoners do not wear instruments of punishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of clothing in prison life, the only thing prisoners can enjoy is tattered cotton-padded coats that are not washed all year round, stripped from the dead and worn by the living. The cotton inside is knotted and cannot be loosened. If you wear it, a large lump will grow in some places; in others, only a single layer of fabric remains. It cannot be taken apart and washed, because it is too rotten, and once taken apart it will disintegrate and no longer be considered clothing. But even with such dirty old clothes, there are only a few dozen pieces, and many cannot get them or wear them. As for the new clothes donated by philanthropists, prisoners cannot wear them. Some are replaced by the guards with old, written-off prison clothes, and the new ones are exchanged for money to buy opium. Some are kept by the prison officials, and only when visitors come are they given to the prisoners to wear to make a grand appearance and demonstrate the achievements of the administration. If there are visitors and there are not enough new prison clothes for the prisoners to wear, then the prisoners without new clothes are driven to the latrine to avoid being seen.</p>
<p>As for food, because prisoners' meals are rationed by weight (22 ounces for criminal prisoners, 24 ounces for political prisoners), our clever prison officials mix rotten yellow rice with white pebbles and give it to the prisoners to eat. Once, when I was sick, I was granted special permission to eat slowly (because ordinary prisoners have a fixed time to eat, limited to only a few minutes), so I picked out the pebbles. The result was that the ratio of pebbles to rice was one to one. If someone suspects and says, "How can so many pebbles be excreted?" Then I cannot explain the reason, but my description above is absolutely true. Perhaps these pebbles have been researched by prison experts and can be mixed as food! Or perhaps it is the same as the Guanyin clay eaten by people in famine-stricken provinces such as Shaanxi and Gansu? However, the prisoners all feel that they have considerable constipation, which may be related to this. The rice is like this, and the vegetables are even worse. Each person gets such a small piece of rotten yellow vegetables for each meal, just for decoration. As for the filth in it, it is even more unbearable to ask about. When it rains, earthworms can be eaten out of the vegetables, and newspaper scraps are commonplace. Each person gets three bamboo tubes of water to drink every day, and there is no tea. Only in the summer are there two weeks of boiled barley water to drink.</p>
<p>Speaking of hygiene in prison, how can Chinese people have such good fortune! In the summer, each time over one hundred and sixty people share only three buckets of water for bathing. How can you wash with this? There are two visits from the doctor every week, but it is very dangerous to talk about taking medicine. If you have heatstroke, you don't get heatstroke medicine, but you are given alum water to drink. For headaches and fever, a whole pot of unknown Chinese medicine is boiled and each person is given a bowl to drink, without asking about the differences in the diseases. When you are seriously ill and enter the ward, it is really calling you to wait for death. There is no medicine there, and no one to take care of you, so prisoners are very afraid of entering the ward when they are seriously ill. If the guards hear a sick prisoner groaning loudly, disturbing their peace, they only need to threaten the sick prisoner, saying, "If you continue like this, I will send you to the ward!" If the prisoner has not lost consciousness, he will not dare to groan again. From this, you can see the awe of the ward.</p>
<p>The work can be divided into two parts, namely: (1) piecework. If you make a woolen sweater for someone, you can earn two or three yuan in wages outside, but the prison only gives us fifteen copper coins. Making socks, sewing the sock heads, each dozen gets fifteen cash, which is one and a half copper coins. (2) long-term work, that is, working in a factory specially set up in the prison, working twelve or thirteen hours a day. It is said that each prisoner can get a dime or so of wages every day, but this wage is nominally saved, but in reality, prisoners can only buy things once a month, opening an account for five hundred wen. The rest cannot be used at all, and the prisoners are not given an account on holidays to know how much they have saved. Then, where did the wages go? Most of those who do long-term work are sentenced to life imprisonment or more than ten years of imprisonment. Some of them die of illness in a few years, and some have no hope of ever being released. Even if they can be released, this muddled account cannot be cleared, and who dares to clear it? Only God knows this.</p>
<p>There is one more thing, that is, we women inevitably have our periods once a month, but each time when our period comes, the guards only give us twenty pieces of paper (four inches square). How can this be used in a week? So we have to use rotten dirty cloth instead. Some get poisoned and sick because of this, and some are discovered by the guards and suffer cruel punishment, saying that they have torn up public clothes, an unforgivable crime.</p>
