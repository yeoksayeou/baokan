<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c49">東方形勢之一轉變實 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>東方問題的以惡化至此。固由我國實力缺乏。不　保障眞正之和平。同時英國關係亦十分重大。英國初對日本在東北之軍事行動。處處作壁上觀。坐視日本阻止蘇聯勢力之東出。壓抑中國民族運動之向上發展。及至日本占據東北四省。威脅平津。我中國固遭蒙空前未有之損害。國際市塲亦同受强烈之震撼。英帝國附此旣不能變更其歷史上對蘇聯之態度。又不能抑制日本。不得已乃堅决的放棄其自由貿易之立塲。努力實行去年渥大華英帝國經濟會議所决定「經濟聯盟」之策。略圖國内經濟上之自給自足。西制歐洲并抗北美。東制日本所倡之「日滿經濟聯盟。」保持在華市塲藉以延續其支配世界之命運殊不知日本與英吉利。雖同爲島國。在遠東市塲上雖同有防止蘇聯之意。而市場上商品貿易。無論爲棉製品爲其他精製品。適皆處於對立競爭之地位而不易調和。不特此也。日本製品尤其是棉製品。竟一躍而登印度市塲。菲洲各地。亦莫不日貨充斥。英國乃易主爲客。仍處於被動地位矣。　　就世界一般情勢觀察。英國在各自治領殖民地不易維持之際。而蘇聯以新興國家。雄據歐亞。對印對華。皆有莫大影響。似有非聯日不可之勢。然而英在資本主義國家中。薫陶最久。國際外交。又素稱老練。焉肯輕易示弱於日以自墮其聲勢。况世界經濟會議關幕在即。設使會議而果成功。英國必能在此時期中取得最大利益。即不幸而會議失敗。英亦有相當準備。以實現其優越的孤立政策。維持其年來在經濟恐慌期中之穩定地。位蓋過去二年中美德法各國之生產數字及輸出貿易。均自百分之一一。跌落至百分之四八。恐慌程度逐漸深化。可以槪見。嚯英以抛棄金本位早。市塲又復廣大。故迄今猶能勉强維持一九三一年之狀况而不低落。今年則更積極。甚至抛擲若干國家之通商條約。再行締結新約。强要對手國爲爲最大之讓步。例如丹麥每年輸入煤炭總數。英國須占百分之八十。鋼鐵計七萬五千噸。阿根廷之對英債務。則以購入商品爲交換條件。對丹即以制德。對阿根廷即以制美。今後將更邁步前進。對其他工業國施用同樣手叚。印度之提高棉製品關稅百分之十以至七十五。菲洲亦將發動閉關方法皆所以脅日本也。極言之。即爲「經濟聯盟」之實施耳。</p>
<p>日本對蘇聯封銷。在列國間到處倡導。自命努力實行。於今一年有餘。其成績安在。而日本據以自重暗中又對蘇聯示好。此種形跡，英國豈能毫無所知。一任日本之肆意縱横。而獨得其利。是以政治上。英日兩國自中亞細亞以迄於黑龍江吉林固不能不互相提携。以鞏固東方市塲之旣得利益。而以經濟方面言。紡績品爲英國全經濟體系最重要之一環。在對華市塲。英尚欲竭力保持。不惜犧牲較遠之一部分利以爲交換。何况印度菲洲。本在英國勢力籠罩之下。在英帝經濟聯盟範疇中。必欲使其日趨凝固。自屬當然。其於印度菲洲境内。奮力對外來商品。採取積極攻勢。即所以擴大英國製品之市塲。日本商品。適爲其當前巨敵。而當攻擊之衝。即令英日之間。以政治關係之故。對經濟對立不能不設法調和。但所謂「日印通商」之善後交涉。其協調又豈易成。於是乎日本之孤立將更甚矣。</p>

<p>羅叔各編譯全書二零八頁</p>
<p>紙面六開本實價洋六角</p>
<p>本書係羅叔和先生根據日本東洋經濟社所編之「日本戰時經濟之全貌」作藍本，更參考其他重要材料編譯而成。内容極豐富有價値，尤其在目前中日關係極度緊張中，我們一方面對於日方的陣容，須有一次精密的檢視，一方面對於自已的力量，也須有一番比較的估量，同時，就整個世界觀，日本的能力，究屬居於何等地位，我們尤應有一個明晰的觀察，要完成這些工作，本書恰恰能給我們以一個相當的帮助。茲將本書内容，提要介紹於下：本書共分五章。第一章「戰爭與國家動員計劃」。分四節，第一節說明國家總動員之意義，現代戰爭因着產業界技術上特殊進步，發明許多新兵器，使戰鬭方法一變，戰爭範圍，擴大到從前的幾十倍乃至幾百倍，所謂國家總動員計劃，卽是跟着這種戰爭範圍的擴大而來的。第二節接述國家總動員的方法。首述國家總動員的種類，包括人才，錢財，軍需品三類，在戰爭皆中，需極大數量，並要在極短時間内集中；次述歐洲大戰中交戰國國家總動員的經騐，更分國民動員，產業動員，及交通動員三項。在這表我們可以看到在戰時政府的統制能力可以擴大到如何程度。第三節說明資本主義與國家總動員的關係，明白指出戰爭與資本主義之間，實有不可分離的密切的聯繁關係存在着。第四節述日本軍需工業動員法。日本軍需工業動員法是日本一件極重要的文件，本章全錄，並加扼要之說明。對於日本軍需工業動員的其本形態，從這裏我們可以有一個明白的認識。第二章「日本軍需工業狀態」。將日本的整個軍需工業狀態，作一個槪括的叙述，分金屬工業，機械器具工業，化學工業三節說明之。并附有詳細的日本軍需工廠一　　，這對於日本國勢的調查，非常重要。第四節接述因工廠動員而生的各種社會的結果，指出因軍需品澎漲，必惹起生產組織的紊亂，物價勝貴，加緊剥削勞工，與加重人民負担等惡果，說明戰爭足以「促進政治危機的成熟」，明白告訴我們資本主義的弱點。第三章爲「日本官營事業的解剖」，這一章是啣接上一章日本軍需工業狀態之叙述而將日本歸政府直接管轄的軍需企業作一個詳細的檢視，即對於「日本的官辦事業特别是企業方同面，在怎樣社會經濟的基礎上發生出來，其歷史發展的過程如何，其内容怎樣，現時的任務又怎樣？」作一個調查。共公六節叙述。第一節說明官辦事業的定義及其種類，爲本章綱領，第二節接述日本官辦事業的發生，將日本官辦事業發生的經過，作一個史的展望，同時他告訴我們日本官辦事業内容是如何的龐大。第三節述日本官辦事業的内容，分官辦事業的投資，官辦工廠與勞動工人，日本官辦工廠名目，所在地，主要生產品，及男女職工的分别與其數目及官辦鑛山四項，從這裏我們可以看出日本。第四節述日本官辦事業與國家財政的關係，指出日本官辦事業在財政上根據之强大，即對於國民經濟的重要性，同時，又可看出不生產的軍需工業在全產業中佔如何地位。第五節主要官辦事業的狀態將，日本主要官辦事業；通信，國有鐵道，製鐵所，專賣，海陸軍各工廠，土地等，就其歴史發展的過程與其内容的槪觀，分項說明，關於日本的主要官辦事業，其内容之廣泛與經濟力之强固，由此可見一斑。第六節說明官辦事業與國家統制之關係，指出日本官辦事業「運行的動向，自明治維新時代發端，不僅在產業，而且在更重要軍事上的理由，採取極端的保護政策」，「這就是戰時經濟所以被重視的原因」，「所謂統制也者，是國家資本的獨占」其目的則在「發展軍事工業，」一旦戰爭發生，「無論公私經濟都置諸戰時新編制之下，尤其是比較容易改編的官辦事業，更加緊的全面的向着這方面推進」。這便是日本戰時經濟的内容。第四章「戰時經濟的搆成」，指出日本預算已因對我之不斷的侵略而逹於「戰時經濟」的階段，共分八節叙述。第一節說明日本一九三一年度的預算因着瀋陽事變而驟然增加的情形；第二節叙述一九三二年日本實行預算之大膨脹，「一九三二年度實行預算就帶有很濃厚的戰時財政色彩」；第三節卽繼續說明日本此項預算之增大由於軍事費的膨脹，現時日本差不多「盡其全力於軍備」，「把一切事都暫時遷延」了。一方面是經濟恐慌，愈益深刻，歲入减少，軍事費愈增大，預算益感不足，日政府於是乃有時局匡預算的追加，但此項增加預算，實際上仍用於軍事方面，第四第五第六各節，卽詳述日本此項預算狀態及因預算不足發行公債的情形。第七節述日本一九三三年戰時預算，從這裏我們可以看到一些駭人的數字。編者說：「這樣大的支出預逄，照日本的國力，照現時一般的情形，不可謂不是一種奇蹟！」的確，這是一種奇蹟！第五章「戰時金融政策的動向」。叙述日晒對於因戰事而起的通貨膨脹各種政策之準備，如「銀行兌換劵條例中的改正法律案」，如「日本銀行「納付金」法案」，如「關於國債價」格計算法律案，」，如「防止資本逃避法」等，本章皆錄其全文，並加詳細說明。以表明日本目下已經完全人於備戰狀態，其經濟狀態都帶着戰時經濟姓質。末附日本主要資源需給統計表一，極有參考價値。以上便是本書内容要點一斑。當然，這不過是一個槪略的叙述，還不能說全書精要，全在於是。總之，本書是値得一讀的，無論是專門研究上的參考，與一般靑年的常識上的供給，本書都能盡其相當責任，尤其在目前，本書决不是一種委平常的讀物、這是可以斷言的。據羅先生自己在編譯後記裏說：「我們在好意方面講，日本和我們作了幾千年近隣，在最近五六十年當中的關係尤其密切，我們對於牠的實際情形，特别是在數字上所表示出來的日本，更値得我們注意和研究。就非好意方面講，日本把我們擺在解剖台上，反復解剖公析，不知道有了幾多次，牠所理解的中國縱然祗是平而的，表皮的，但扼着了要點，至少牠能抓着現實；然而我們之於日本，雖把牠當作假想敵人丨丨近一年半以來已經成了正面敵人，無論在經濟上，政治上，軍事上都處於對立地位，最近的將來沒有調和的希望，可是我們對牠的理解并不很多，在數字上的認識，在日本戰時的準備更値得我們考究。這本小册編　的動機也就在此。」可見此書價値之一斑。中有重統計凡五十餘表。</p>

<p>失敗於巴埃手中</p>
<p>丨謝蓋將與加奈拉交手丨</p>
<p>擊拳比賽盛行歐美、重量賽尤爲重視、近年來世界重量舞臺上之權威者、恒推重德之薛墨林及美之謝蓋氏、蓋逢傑克台姆山落伍、重量錦標花冠、輙在二氏頭上轉移而已、英雄造時勢、騖訊遙傳、所謂德之重量擊拳家薛墨林忽然失敗於之馬克巴埃手中、巴埃美國加洲人、年經力强、本屆世界重量錦標賽逐鹿之一人也、本月二十九日意大利「巨人」擊拳家加奈拉與美國謝蓋相遇、勝利之一人、卽與巴埃比賽、卽世界重量錦標之一幕也、</p>
<p>賽時盛况薛墨林與巴埃之戰、雖非錦標一幕、但於將來錦標、極有關係、薛氏之敗、本屆逐鹿錦標之資格、亦隨之喪失、二人於八日在紐約比賽、作壁上觀者達六萬人、門券收入、亦有二十五萬元之多、美國經濟繁榮、雖尚未至恢復、有斯盛舉、足知其嗜好之深矣、比賽原定十五回合、但至第十合回、薛墨林倒地復起之後、載判墨那文卽停止薛墨林再賽、而判勝利歸　巴埃、蓋當時薛氏在被擊倒復起之後、實無餘力對付、如果勉强從事、徒屬枉然也、</p>
<p>失敗經過第一第二兩回合、二人工力相等、第三回合起薛氏　有不敵之勢、第五回合、薛氏漸起、反占優勝、第七回合、巴埃又猛擊得勢、薛氏表示軟弱、第入回合、局面又反、薛氏上風、第九回合、巴埃仍然振作、而薛氏相形見拙、第十回合、巴埃有力之揮擊、直迫薛氏退諸繩旁、右手一拳、薛氏倒地、裁判口呼號數、待至第九數時、薛氏方起、膝弱無力、呼吸短促、尚欲再戰、被裁判停止、遂告失敗、巴埃體重二○三磅薛氏一八九又四分之一磅、巴埃得勝、半由於此也、</p>

<p>（馬尼拉特訊）第十屆遠東軍動會、决定明年五月間、在菲島馬尼刺舉行、菲島體育協會、已早將日期通知中日邀請參加、茲據該會消息、我國迄未有覆函、表示是否參加、而日本全國體育協進會、則覆函謂須一併邀請其一手所造成之（僞）「滿洲」傀儡政府參加、現菲體育協會、對此問題、頗有焦慮、不易解决、蓋如不邀請所謂滿洲國參加、則日本或將以此爲要挾、同時拒絶參加、是明年之遠東運動會、不免稍殺風景矣、</p>
<p>然邀請所謂（僞）「滿洲國」參加、亦非不成問題、蓋所謂（僞）「滿洲國」者、曾爲國聯所通過不予承認、去年在美國洛杉磯舉行之世界運動會、當時日本亦曾介紹、請准所謂（僞）「滿洲國」參加、卒因各國不承認所謂（僞）「滿洲國」、遂拒絶參加、</p>
<p>又另一問題附帶發生者、苟日本之傀儡政府、如所謂（僞）「滿洲國」者可以參加、何獨日本二殖民地、如台灣、如朝鮮、則不許其參加耶、此問題菲體育協會、定最近召開常會時提出討論、以謀一根本之解决云、</p>

<p>二比零打敗夏令冠軍波希米</p>
<p>風雨之後一塲水戰大顯身手</p>
<p>美妙驚人表演菲島球塲少見</p>
<p>（本報駐菲記者文初自馬尼拉發）</p>
<p>東華足球隊來菲、第一塲以二比二和西班牙俱樂部、六月一日、作第二戰、以二比零打敗匪島夏令冠軍波希米隊、大快人心、</p>
<h3 id="c201">風雨大作祇得改期 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>第二塲之戰、原訂爲五月三十日、再見干戈於嘉年華會足球塲内、但天不作美、自朝至午、風雨交加、致球場泥濘不堪、迫得展期至（一日）舉行、當時一般臨塲準備觀東華健兒、在岷第二次比賽之球迷、莫不掃與而歸、</p>
<h3 id="c202">敵方實力亦未可侮 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>至於波希米體育會隊、係去屆岷埠夏令足球賽會英商Ｗｈｉｔｅｂｒｅａｄ杯之冠軍、全隊前線、行軍迅速、後衛防守鞏固、回溯今年挑選手出席岷埠·怡朗·埠際中球比賽、該隊於預賽時、曾與聖迷拉戰和、且上星期日、仁東華作第一戰之西班牙俱樂部將材六人、來自斯隊、各選手以深悉東華之戰術、感抱必勝東華之宏願、</p>
<h3 id="c203">風雨之後重見天日 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>一日自晨至午、天氣晴和、二時半風雨驟至、但至五時陽光普照、天氣晴明、一般球迷、咸以大雨之後、球塲必成澤國、定有再改期之舉、不料事又不然、當雨止後、球塲雖甚泥濘、然主事者以天朗氣淸、有比賽可能、乃下令開賽、立卽召集球塲職員、如賣票守門等到場辦事、惜雨後知有比賽者甚少、故購券入場者、不過二百餘人、爲岷埠歴次看重要足球比賽之最低紀錄、斯亦天氣晦明無定、有以致之、</p>
<h3 id="c204">戰塲澤國苦哉健兒 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>在五時以前、大雨猶淋漓不止、至五時正、天始放晴、臨時决定比賽、延至五時半始開賽、當時滿天風雲、全場泥濘、低漥之處、積水不除、球體笨重、景象極爲慘淡、</p>
<h3 id="c205">回想前場咸有戒心 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>第一場之戰、打成和局、東華實因場地生疏、昨因天氣關係、每半場雖只戰三十分鐘、兩方各挑精銳應戰、干戈相見之下、經六十分鐘之劇戰、自始至終、莫不在驚濤駭浪之中、表演之劇烈、令人驚心動魄、戰情之緊　張情緒、爲之興奮、蓋東華鑒於初戰之時、令觀者失望、故此場表演、不啻前後判若兩隊、蓋其前鋒衝刺之嬌健、有如生龍活虎、後衛守衛之森嚴、有如銅牆鐵壁、實令人歎服、</p>
<h3 id="c206">團結一致衆志成城 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>昨日之戰、敵方實抱必定屈服東華之决心、故開戰之時、即施其猛烈之壓迫、失敗後復出其粗野舉動以頑抗、下半場東華門前、受其不少之騷擾、所幸陸鍾恩守門、鎭靜敏捷、馮運佑李寗合力左右維護、加以孫思敬·屠開元·梁樹棠、堅守中原、得以安然無恙、至於五前鋒陳家球·陳洪光·李義臣、有數次驚人遠射、惜失之釐毫、陳虞添·萬象華、互有美妙之盤射、尤以萬象華之角球、傳中之準確、此間足球界、實所鮮見、下半場　陳家球之曹秋亭、盤交活潑、殊見稱職、東華兩球之得、雖爲陳虞添李義臣立功者、然苟無萬象華之挑　、恐未克奏功、故論功行賞、萬亦不可沒也、</p>
<h3 id="c207">敵方猛悍大可驚人 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>敵方出師、皆揀選能征慣戰之將、以左衛中爲最出色、脚頭强硬、盤弄亦佳東華第一防線、常被其盤過、但遇馮運佑之大脚、屢爲辟易、右中衛亦恃其高偉之體賦、而顯其頭技、但在孫思敬監視之下、不能逞技、其餘各正前鋒與左翼及左内鋒、均爲奔射迅速之騎士、但咸急於立功、故數次得射球良機、均失之過切、無濟於事、其守門加些亞氏、身手的確靈敏、蓋昨日敵方如非此君之力、負球當在六球之多、</p>
<h3 id="c208">大戰開始即起總攻 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>鐵笛聲中、敵首取攻勢、五前鋒連環進逼、出師半途、爲孫思敬截住、遠傳與陳噳添、單刀赴會、直扣敵門、内衛出而</p>
<p>抵禦、亦以遠傳與其左翼舉射被陸鍾恩接出、一般觀衆以戰雲甫開、而情形如斯緊凑、大戰已在意中、</p>
<h3 id="c209">虞添一頂先破敵門 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>戰雲初開、敵方即取攻勢、被我軍盡掃出境、斯時我軍、施其遠射工夫、球皆在敵營門外盤旋、經四度之環攻、皆爲其頑抗、不克奏功、而四座之掌　聲與呼聲、克如響斯應矣、果也東華得角球之機、由萬象華瞄準一脚落點恰在門前、陳虞添認定目的衝前、趁球未着地之前、迎之以頭、昂首一頂、球應聲飛進網裏、菲島號稱鐵門之加些亞氏、莫知所措、幾疑此球來自天上、四座歡呼與掌聲齊起、咸慶勝利、此球之得、離開塲已近二十分矣、</p>
<h3 id="c210">乘勝進取奮勇爭先 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>東華旣勝一球、軍心益壯、前鋒五虎、進攻益急絶無初戰時客氣謙讓之風、蓋已飽嘗第一戰所得之敎訓　前次比賽、因太過逢信、致被敵人所乘、深知非從轟烈剛强之戰略下手爲功、故由李義臣率領三軍、直搗敵壘陳洪光與李義臣及陳家球萬象華、均有優美遠射之表演、一時敵軍壁壘之下、盡是東華健兒之足跡、幸得加些亞氏救護得法、雖未致負球、然在塲西班牙觀衆、吃驚不小、</p>
<h3 id="c211">再接再厲又開紀錄 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>休息旣過、易地再戰、東華以曹秋亭調陳家球、對方前鋒左内鋒亦皆調換、東華依然主政、五前鋒東窺西探、得隙而鑽、李義臣陳洪光、雙雙並進、李義臣之遠射、與額上盤弄之技、有李惠堂之風、有一次從三十碼遠踼、中門角彈出、敵方鐵門爲之吃驚、其後萬象華得陳虞添之接濟、左隀放馬、其疾如飛、敵右衛追之不及、盤至相當地點、立卽傳中、李義臣單槍匹馬踵前、加踼一脚、人並倒地、鐵門將雖有回天本領、亦不能脫此一脚之險矣、</p>
<h3 id="c212">臨了一刻戰情愈緊 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>敵方原非平庸之旅、豈願長受壓迫、有長脚仙混號之前鋒、喝令全軍反攻、其長傳遞頗見功效、五前鋒頻向東華門前問鼎、陸踵恩門前、忽時見敵踪、對於來球、高擋低截、大有應接不暇之勢、遇險凡兩次、一次被敵軍正前鋒、在門前十五碼直射、華被考陸眼快手捷、用手掌擋也、越門而過、又有一次對方從左路打來急而低之球、老陸以手來不及、即用脚踼出、東華過此兩度危關、後全隊轉攻爲守、益審愼從事、藉以糾纒時間、故下塲對方攻守甚烈、但直至完塲、仍無絲毫功續云、</p>

<p>你的收音機裏的眞空管，是最新式·的麽？如果仍是舊式的，那麽，你的收音機已成爲時代的落伍者了，請你趕快換上最新式的，會使你有意想不到的成績，調換的方法，寫在後面：</p>
<p>２２７丨丨這種舊式眞空管，可以新式的５６代之，收音機的線路，無需絲毫改動，這種新式管的形式很小，可以使收音機的地位；經濟絲極電流僅需一安培，較之２２７可省去７５安培，所以在電源變壓器不良的收音機裏，尤爲敵用；或者你的收音機想增加眞空管數時，用這種新式管，可以使電力部份無需改動。　　２２４丨丨此項眞空管，可以５７或５８代之，有時高週率變壓器的初級，須換一總阻（Ｉｍｐｅａｎｃｅ）較高的，否則效率較差，如用５７時，音量控制須改接在陰極線路以代簾　綫路，眞空管座，一定要改用六脚的。換用此項新式管，無論檢波或放大，效率可增進不少。節省絲極電流，和上述的相同。</p>
<p>２８８丨丨此項全波整流管，可以新式的水銀蒸氣管８２代之。絲極電壓，必須改用２·５伏脫。優點因此管的電壓内降（ＩｎｔｅｒｎａｌＤｒｏｐ）祗有十五弗打，所以可使輸出的直流電壓增加，此增加的電壓可使收音機的音量增加。眞空管座，無需調換，但是必需以一小的高週率扼制綫圈在電源變壓器高壓綫圈的中心接頭上，以免除高週率的電流，流入電力部分。</p>
<h3 id="c218">音量控制器在廣播機上之應用 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>平常我們以日爾曼銀絲繞的一種阻力器，呌做Ｒｈｅｏｓｔａｔｅ（變量耗阻器）他的用途大半是用來控制燈絲的電流的。另外有一種，其形狀也和變量耗阻器一樣，是靠着一個指臂的移動，來變化他値的大小；不過指臂所貼着的地方，不是日爾曼銀絲，而是炭精等原料所作成的；呌做ＰａｔｅｎｔｉｏｍｅｔｅｒｏｒＶｏｌｕｍｇｒａｄ（音量控制器）若是論到他們數値的區别，則變量耗阻器，普通不過數十歐姆而已；音量控制器則往往是由數萬至數十萬。</p>
<p>音量控制器通常的用途，是放在收音機裏面，作過荷（Ｏｖｅｒｌｏａｄ）的调劑；　　第一圖</p>
<p>因爲一部收音機收本埠電臺，每因距離接近的關係，獲得强大的電力，使收得的聲音失眞起來。爲補救這種現象而用的音量控制器便有的時候用於射電週率放大級，（如第一圖之ＡＢＣ）有的時候又用於成音週率放大級。（如圖中Ｄ）至於阻力含數的比較，用於射電週率放大級的常是十萬歐姆，用於成音週率放大級的常是五十萬歐姆。</p>
<p>這兒另外有一種用法，是把他裝在廣播機上，代替開關。（Ｓｗｉｔｃｈ）設若目前我們的廣播機共有言語放大級，强力放大級，調幅級，三大部份。傳話器（Ｍｉｃｒｏｐｂｏｎ）是接在言語放大級，專爲廣播臺上報告等之用。拾音器（Ｐｉｃｋｕｐ）是接到强力放大級眞空管的栅極上，專爲留聲片音樂之播送。另外還有一個從别處音樂廳接來的言語放大級，是專爲那一個音樂廳的表演節目廣播於有收音機的無線電聽衆之用。則其控制的設計，有如第二圖：</p>
<p>第二國</p>
<p>圖中甲乙丙，便是三個音量控制器；若此刻我們僅僅需要報告節目等，則甲内之矢頭，從Ｄ點移到Ａ點，乙内之矢頭，移至Ｂ點，丙内之矢頭移至Ｆ點。這意思就是說當甲内之矢頭在Ｂ點時，他的線路是成了短路；今移至Ａ點，兩線間旣有十數萬歐姆之高耗阻，於是電流便沿着兩線的本身而至１３兩點。這兩點便是接至强力放大級變壓器之初級。至於乙丙兩部份之移到Ｄ點及Ｆ點，也不過是使他成短路的意思。所以這時候强力放大部份中只有報告節目等。的低週率唱片或音樂廳來的音樂都不會滲入。反之，倘若我們只要留聲片經拾音器而來的低週率走入２３兩點至强力放大部份的栅極，則將甲部份之Ａ點移至Ｂ點，丙部份的矢頭仍遺留在Ｆ點上，也絶對不會發生什麽滲混的作用的。因爲甲部份經Ａ點移到Ｂ點時，他又成爲短路了。在圖中的另外，兩個耗阻，則是控制到强力放大栅極的電力的。</p>
<p>這種設計，對於廣播機有兩種好處：㈠不像用開關當掉换時的有卜落之聲傳進收音者的耳鼓，因爲他是旋動音量控制器的指壁，漸漸從零到最大歐姆的數値。㈡倘我們爲使我們報告時，有一種藝術的趣味，調劑我們說話的枯燥，不妨仍然有一種較低聲的樂曲，作爲伴奏，那嗎除讓圖中之丙部份成短路外，乙部份之拾音器仍移於轉動的留聲片上：只將音量調節器上之矢頭，移到有相當的耗阻値處而不讓他至Ｄ點，成爲短路，則我們便可同時聞得報告者之言語及留聲片之音樂了。（指臂適當的位置，决定耗阻的大小，耗阻的大小，决定留聲片音樂之商低；只要稍稍實騐，其調節是極爲聽命而能得着美好之結果的。</p>
<p>另外須注意的事，就是音量器控制器之指臂上的螺絲釘，久旋之後必會鬆動，鬆動後對於廣播出之言語音樂便滲有爆竹之聲。倘然我們偶爾忽略了這個原因，必會枉費許多精力反覆考查别的部份而不得結果的。作者曾因此上過當，所以順便贅及於此。</p>

<p>— 貽孫</p>
<p>在旅行式的無線電收音機中，最主要的條件，是使機件簡單和重量輕小，機件簡單則使用時候，管理非常便易，重量輕小則在登山，行軍時，隨身携帶，旣不佔地，又不費力，可是旅行式收音機，除上述二要旨外，更要音量好，這是普通所不易做得到的事情，現在讓我介紹一只收音機，讀者可在第一圖中見其綫路，此種收音機除聽筒外重量不過三磅，又因爲做在一只雪茄烟匣内，所以佔據地位很小，普通廣播電浪，都可以收到，更妙在不用天地線，（天線圈繞在匣邊上）所以選擇性也好，在上海，南京，杭州，等處，收聽起來，淸爽響亮，沒有一點雜聲，</p>
<p>這種無極回授式（Ｓｕｐｅｒｒｅｇｅｎｅｒａｔｉｏｎ）</p>
<p>的收音機，效力特别的好，更奇怪的事情，就是Ｂ電祇用四個半伏脫，據實騐的結果，四個半伏脫，已經夠你亨用了·假使沒有Ｂ電池，也可以收音，不過音量太小，在圖中可以看到，因爲用了考而畢的間斷週率振盪線路，（ＣｏｌｐｉｔｔｓＩｎｔｅｒｓｕｐｔｅｄＦｒｅｑｕｅｎｃｙＯｓｃｉｌｌａｔｏｒ）所以佔據地位减少，線圈是用分頭釘來調節，避却了活動線圈的麻煩，增加收音的穩定，扼制線圈是用一英寸厚二英寸半長和一英寸寛的軟鐵片做成，三十五號美國標準漆包線，在鐵心上繞五千圈就夠了，或者買一只三十亨利低週波扼制線圈也可·</p>

<p>— 襄</p>
<p>收聽優美音樂時，最討厭的，莫如雜聲的騷擾；雜聲的來源，雖有一部份由於不可避免的天電，然大部都是人造的，如年紅燈（ＮｅｏｎＬｉｇｈｔ）的明暗，電</p>
<p>車的駛行等，都可使收音機感受雜聲；採得這許多雜聲的，並不是天線本身，却都是牠的附屬品引入線，所以要免除雜聲，祇需改良引入線的裝置，便很有成效。</p>
<p>先架設長一百呎的天綫，高度至少須離屋面六呎，以愈高爲愈妙；然後自製一天線交連變壓器ＬＩ：繞製方法，以三十號雙層紗包綫，在半英吋平方的木心上，重疊繞一百五十圈，全綫圈的闊度是１／４时，在第二十五圈處出一接頭：以内端通地，外端接天綫；引入線必須用有金屬隔離（即遮蔽Ｓｈｉｅｌｄ）的單根導線，一端連在Ｌ的接頭上，一端通至收音機變壓器Ｌ２，Ｌ２的製法，完全與ＬＩ同，惟一端須</p>

<p>的固定電容器，然後再接至收音機的天線接柱上；線圈ＬＩＬ２都要浸在溶有蠟的金屬隔離盒裏，所有金屬隔離器，都要接連地線，方能有效。</p>
<p>用這種的天線裝置，試騐結果，大槪有百分之八十的雜聲，可以完全避免，而於收音機的靈敏度，選擇性，也能改進不少。</p>

<p>二種繞線圈的方法</p>
<p>平常手繞的綫圈，要想整齊緊密，是很困難的。這裏有二種方法，可以得到上述的目的：</p>
<h3 id="c223">鉄釘彈簧銅綫鉄鉗 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>㈠鐵釘一根，套入彈簧内，穿過木筒後，用鐵鉗夾住。（見圖）在繞綫圈的時候，銅綫便能自動退出。</p>
<p>㈡假如所用的銅線，不是整磅的，那末可將銅線的一端，縛在窗鈎上，繞時，人由遠至近，也可得到良好的成績。</p>
<h3 id="c224">怎樣避免身體容量 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>收音機在調節時，聲浪很響，放手時便寂然無聲，這是人身對於收音機發生電容作用的緣故。如果調節的是電容器，祇要將牠的勸片接通地線，便可避免。其他的調節器，祗要在調節柄的後面，舖上一方銅片，再把銅片接通地線也行。</p>
<h3 id="c225">交流收音機耗電之計算 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 程權</p>
<p>交流收音機雖用電極省，然因常人對於電之常識甚缺，故觀機内燈管之多，放聲之洪，以爲用費必費，遂不敢暢用。更有借居他家者，因屋主不明之故而不能用，有苦難言，殊覺不便。其實交流收音機耗電極省，可用下列二法算出，有收音機者若加一算，則於使用時可有把握。借居他家者亦可由之算出每有耗電之確數，雙方均感便利。</p>
<p>㈠交流收音機之後部，有一小銅牌，牌面註有該機之牌號，製造者之廠名，及每小時耗電之瓦特數。今設某收音機每小時耗電一百瓦特，則使用十小時即用電一度，（俗稱走一字，蓋火表走一度適爲耗電一千瓦特也。）普通八燈六流收音機，每小時約耗電一百瓦特，以電費每度一角六分計之，則用一小時，尚不足大洋二分，可稱便宜極矣。</p>
<p>㈡如爲自製之收音機，或使用其他各種電器用品。則可由火表小窗内轉輪旋轉之速度而推算之。如某收音機於使用時，火表之轉輪每分鐘轉二十轉，則一小時轉一千二百轉，再視火表上每一基羅瓦后（即一千瓦特亦即一度）輪之轉數。設火表上註明如下。</p>
<p>ＩＫＷＨ＝７５００ＲＥＶ·ｏｆＤｉｓｃ即知耗電一度。須輪轉七千五百次。今某收音機每小時轉一千二百次。則每小時僅耗電１２００／７５００度即百分之十六度（上述試騐之時須將電燈關熄，否則不準確。）</p>

<p>不料時到今日，這名話却應在「川戰」方面，幾乎變成「不祥之詞」了；照字面明晰的解釋起來，就是「四川的戰事，輪流不息。」說也笑話，我們貴國，自民元以來：國内戰爭，此仆彼起，好算是川流不息。尤其是四川一省，十幾年來，循環往復，戰爭不知已達若干次？最近如二劉之爭，弄得生靈　炭。現在瘡痍未復，鄧劉二將，又在火併。戰事这樣的川流不息，試問民何以堪？國何以存？</p>
<p>在此國難緊急的當兒：以堂堂統兵大員，高級軍事長官，乃有如此　興，會異常賣力，大打出后。不怕人民喝倒彩，不怕外國人笑掉牙齒，我眞佩服他們的養到功深。現雖經中央政府文電交馳，設法制止。但若輩興政正濃，戰事方酣，一時尚未肯罷休。好比一家中子弟竹突，打得頭破血流，家長喝止無效，這還成爲家庭嗎？這就是應了敵人所說的「無組織的國家」一句話。</p>

<p>— 游光</p>
<p>愛夜的人，也不但是孤獨者，在閒者，不能戰鬭者，怕光明者。</p>
<p>人的方行，在白天和在深夜，在日下和在燈前，常常顯得兩樣。夜是造化所織的幽玄的天衣，普覆一切人，使他們温暖，安心，不知不覺的自己漸漸脫去人造的面具和衣裳，赤條條地裹在這無邊際的黑絮似的大塊裏。</p>
<p>雖然是夜，但也有明暗。有微明，有昏暗，有伸手不見掌，有漆黑一團糟。愛夜的人要有聽夜的耳朶和看夜的眼睛，自在暗中，看一切暗。君子們從電燈下走入暗室中，伸開了他的懶腰；愛侶們從月光下走進樹陰裏，突變了他的眼色。夜的降臨，抹殺了一切文人學士們當光天化日之下，寫在耀眼的白紙上的超然，混然，恍然，勃然，粲然的文章，只剩下乞憐，討好，撒謊，騙人，吹牛，搗鬼的夜氣，形成一個燦爛的金色的光圈，像見於佛畫上面似的，籠罩在學識不凡的頭腦上。</p>
<p>愛夜的人於是領受了夜所給與的光明。</p>
<p>高跟鞋的摩登女郎在馬路邊的電燈光下，閣閣的走得很起勁，但鼻尖也閃爍着一點油汗，在證明她是初學的時髦，假如長在明晃晃的照耀中，將使她碰着「沒落」的命運。一大排　着的店鋪的昏暗助她一臂之力，使她放緩開足的馬力，吐一口氣，這時纔覺得沁心脾的夜裏的拂拂的凉風。</p>
<p>愛夜的人和摩登女郎，於是同時領受了夜所給與的恩惠。</p>
<p>一夜已盡，人們又小心翼翼的起來，出來了，便是夫婦們，面目和五六點鐘之前也何其兩樣。從此就是熱鬧，喧囂。而高牆後面，大厦中間，深閨裏，黑獄裏，客室裏，秘密機關裏，却依然瀰漫着驚人的眞的大黑暗。</p>
<p>現在的光天化日，熙來攘往，就是這黑暗的裝飾，是人肉醬缸上的金蓋，是鬼臉上的雪花膏。只有夜還算是誠實的。我愛夜，在夜間作「夜頌」。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>紀昀閱微草堂筆記載某孀婦携孤子及老姑避難渡河，水流甚急，中流，老姑被衝下水；孀婦急將抱中孤子擱在一邊，去援救她的老姑。誰知救了老姑，却丢了她的孤子。那位老太婆得了老命，却申斥孀婦道；「我的老命有什麽用？</p>
<p>某氏血統只留此孤兒，現在孤兒都丢了，我的老命還有什麽用！」但某孀婦若竟抱了孤子，不管她的老姑；那旁人一定申斥道；「這種女人，太沒良心了；只愛自已的兒子，連婆婆都不管丨」紀昀說得好；在中流時，情勢危急，把兒子順手一放，忙去救她的婆婆，那有思攷的餘地呢？某孀婦做人眞不容易，「直」旣有人申斥，「横」也有人申斥，弄得走頭無路！</p>
<p>現在一班搖筆桿子的朋友所處的地位完全和某孀婦相同了。若要對現狀進忠告下批評，就有人說你帶Ｘ或Ｙ的色彩，已經吃過「蘿葡」了。若轉換方向，不批評政治而批評社會，又有人笑：「你們也來談風月了嗎！哼！」但若再改變方向，不批評政治，也不批評社會，和人家一樣去頌祝聖明，就會不落褒貶了嗎？馬上就有人疑心你要搶他們的飯碗，更不容情地說閑話了。西洋有一父子騎驢的故事，兩人同綺旣不好，兩人同不綺又不好；父騎子行旣不好，子騎父行也不好，無可奈何，只好父子同抬那隻驢，兩人旣抬得滿身是汗，纑子也不知向那兒訴苦去。今日之文人，眞是左右做人難呢！</p>
<h3 id="c257">蕭伯訥在平津 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>蕭伯訥到上海，受到了一般人的歡迎；一到平津，處處所觸到的是冷淡。他乘的車到天津時，來站歡迎他的是一班愛戴他的學生，擎着一面，Ｗｅｌｃｏｍｅｔｏ：ｏｕｔＧｔｅａｔ：Ｇｅｏｔｇｅ：Ｂｅｌｎａｒｄ：Ｓｈｏｗ的旗。誰想到蕭竟不識這抬舉，當着歡迎的羣衆，拍的一下把風窗關了。當時在旁邊的一個新聞記者便對李道：「到了天津，你還不知道嗎？」蕭答道：「Ｔｉｎ」（鉛）與「Ｚｉｎｅ」（鋅）？那自然知道。」</p>
<p>蕭到中國來，很早聲明了是遊北平和長城。但到北平時，除開「張少帥」替他安頓了居住外，平津的敎育界，知識界，竟毫不動聲色；新聞界除替他載着短短的消息外，對於他的評論實在異常不恭。他們對於蕭的「中國苦無文化可言」一語都抱着反感，以爲蕭用了諷刺華侖夫人和她的敎士那種筆調來譏誚中國，實在有些恥辱。而實際，蕭是抱着好感來中國的，他覺得中國沒有很多文化，恐怕這也是一班西洋人所見到的實情，丨在倫敦出版的書，那一本是宣傳中國文化的呢？</p>
<p>平津敎育界知識界之不理會蕭，據我們的推測，約有三個理由。一，大多數不知道蕭其人。記得蕭到平的前一天，和平門外某大學的國學系敎授在休息室看完報後，愕然的朗聲道：「嘿，外國人裏面竟也有姓蕭的啦？」丨丨一時傳爲美談。二，怕失面子。北平的知識界，素來尊重柏拉圖所說「在識即美德」一語的，修養工夫是很深廣的。他們覺得蕭毫沒有一點紳士風度，開口便是「毒辣的句子」，所以與其因歡迎他而討沒趣，不如做個不理。三，非其類。若是羅素杜威到平津去了，就連那裏的敎廳長，大學校長們也得上前去做個拉手的樣子，但蕭不過一個做滑稽文字的罷了，實在不彀資格。這種心理，正如蕭的同黨高爾士華綏在“ＴｈｅＭａｎｏｆＰｒｏＰｏｒｔｙ”中所描寫的Ｆｏｒｇｔｈｅ其人似的，對「智者是懷疑，對於藝術家是輕視」。所以北平的敎育界（並非指全體），也就只知怎樣保障薪水的安全，拿到薪水後怎樣託名假義來開舖店（骨子裏並不淸高），报以蕭在平方所受的冷淡，不過表現一班腐化份子的無感覺罷了。無怪乎他走到日本，第一着便要去見荒木大帥哩。</p>

<p>— 熊湘女士</p>
<p>五月二十二日</p>
<p>一房中祗有紹興人最有趣，有說有笑，說出來常常使滿房的人忍俊不禁，忘了病苦。她的身世，不肯實說，看情形，她也並不是可以忘憂的人，然而她很快樂。湖北人是和男人私逃出來的，和父母斷絶了關係，出來以後，生活不大好，常在被中朦着臉，哽哽咽咽的哭。她的身材看起來像一個十三四歲的女孩，然而她的心却已經歷經苦難了。江西人是個大塊頭，丈夫在上廠作工，從來沒有工夫來看她，聽說一天祗可以賺四角大洋，而三等病房却要五角。廣東人，家况似乎比較好，但終日躺着，從不作聲。</p>
<p>今天發現江西人所菜不夠吃，餐餐祗能有個半飽。我把我自己的一份送給她，因爲明哥已爲我另外送了菜來了。院裏的菜祗有薄薄的兩個小碟，我不知道是怕病人多吃了生病呢？還是在三等病房的人就該少吃。</p>
<p>明哥看了我的日記，有些怏届不樂，我知道是因爲我前晚的夢，觸了他的積　。這夢眞是該詛咒的。可是牠就像一匹夜貓，襲到我的心上，無法擺脫，我也知道這夢是不該作的。連生是夜貓，明哥不是我晨鳴的大呌雞公麽？我要向着黎明，决不願重回黑暗。别了，連生？我不願再夢見你。</p>
<p>五月二十二日</p>
<p>江西人沒有交費，醫生說，住院是要錢的，不能做好事，她祗好搬了出去。紹興人下午也走了，廣東人是開了刀的　現在開刀的病好了，可是又要移一内科去。這裏祗剩下我和湖北人，湖北人交過兩塊錢，她計算了幾遍，說已經住過好幾天了，再住不下去，而病又不好，非常心焦。我是預交過七元的，算起來，我在她們中要算境遇最好，可以住到十四天。規定是三等病房預交十五元，然而三等竟沒有一人有這種能力，可知在三等病房裏的人，是怎樣的人物。這醫院是不作好事的。</p>
<p>下午湖北人呌茶房到賬房去算賬，自已寫了一封信給醫生，請求減費，結果怎樣可不知道。她隨即也穿好衣服出去了，不久又有一個新人補進來，結果這房中仍然是新來的和我兩人。明哥今天又送了許多食物來（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c259">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Jules　kenaro作　林取譯</p>
<p>瑪狄爾德</p>
<p>「媽媽，你曉得嗎，」姐姐愛勒絲丁氣喘呼呼地跑來對雷辟克家的說，「紅蘿蔔鬚又和那小瑪狄爾德在牧塲上裝作丈夫和老婆玩着。大哥菲利克斯給他們裝扮着。介我記得這事是你不許做的，如果我沒有記錯的話。」</p>
<p>眞的，小瑪狄爾德身上裝綴着開了白花的野牡丹蔓，一動也不動地呆立在牧塲上。她打扮得花花綠綠的，竟像一個眞的飾着橙樹的新娘。她也有着和緩一切生之苦痛的什麽呢。</p>
<p>她身上的牡丹蔓，起初是編成一個圓圈戴在頭上，再一條一條地垂上來，垂在下巴底下，垂在背上，垂在兩臂上，捲捲曲曲的圍了一身，一直垂則地上，拖成一條尾巴，大哥菲利克斯還盡力的把這尾巴延長着。</p>
<p>他退後幾步說道：</p>
<p>「不要動！現在輪着你了，紅蘿蔔鬚。」</p>
<p>現在輪到紅蘿蔔鬚裝扮成年靑的新郎，他也滿披牡丹蔓，這裏那裏點綴着一些鶯粟，蒲公英，山查子　等，以便現得和瑪狄爾德不同。他並沒有笑的意思，三個人都現得很正經。他們知道每一種儀式所應取的態度。參與葬禮是應當始終現得悲戚的；參與婚禮，則在行畢彌撒之前，是應當保持莊嚴的。不然的話，那便玩來都沒有興趣了。</p>
<p>「你們要互握着手呀，」大哥菲利克斯說。「朝前面走！不要太急。」</p>
<p>他倆鬆鬆地並立着，合着脚步往前走。當瑪狄爾德覺得行走不便時，她便把那牡丹蔓做的長裾捲起，用手捻着。紅蘿蔔鬚很温從地等待着她，把一隻腿子舉起，做着開步的姿勢。</p>
<p>大哥菲利克斯引着他倆從牧塲上走過。他在他們前面向後退着，搖擺兩臂，好使他倆不致把脚步弄亂。他起初裝作市長向他們致敬，隨後裝作牧師給他們祝福，再後裝作賀客對他們頌揚，最後裝作樂師用一根棍子擦着另一根棍子以代提琴。</p>
<p>他使他們縱横地走着。</p>
<p>「停住！」他說，「現在弄亂了。」</p>
<p>他把瑪狄爾德頭上的花冠弄平了一下，又呌他們走動起來。</p>
<p>「啊咿！」瑪狄爾德做着怪樣子呌說。</p>
<p>牡丹蔓上的一個卷鬚把她的頭髮鈎住了。大哥菲利克斯通通給她扯掉。大家再繼續走着。「好啦，」他說，「現在你們已經成婚了，你們親嘴罷。」</p>
<p>他看見他倆猶疑着，便說道：</p>
<p>「怎的！怕什麽！親嘴呀。人們旣然成婚了，便應當親嘴的。做些取媚的樣子，說點求愛的話呀。你們的臉孔都像包着鉛似的。」</p>
<p>比他們高强，也許已經講過愛情的他，嘲笑着他們的拙劣。他最先各瑪狄爾德親嘴了丨這是他辛苦的酬報丨給他們做着榜樣。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚鼓起了勇氣，隔著那牽來纒去的植物尋覓瑪狄爾德的面孔，他在她的頰上吻了一下。</p>
<p>「這並不是玩笑呢，」他說，「我將來會眞的各你結婚的。」</p>
<p>瑪狄爾德也在紅蘿蔔鬚的頰上回吻了一下。卽刻，拙劣，忸怩，兩個人都滿臉通紅。</p>
<p>大哥菲利克斯丵他們做着嘲弄的樣子。</p>
<p>「紅了臉啦！紅了臉啦！」</p>
<p>他把兩個指頭互擦着，頓着脚，嘴上浮着輕衊的笑。（未完）</p>

<p>— 良</p>
<p>我的心愛的薇··自你四朋三十號失踪以來，我陷於極端的昏迷狂亂中，無限的悲痛宰割着我的心靈。我不曾有過一夜安睡，不曾一夜不在夢寐中失聲痛哭，不曾一時一刻忘念你。這不可遏制的劇烈的創痛，直逼着我比就死刑還要難過千萬倍呵！你是我生命中的一切，你的失踪是毁喴了我的天地！沒有你我是活不成的丨親愛的你回來吧！</p>
<p>幾年以來組織着我倆恩愛這樣情切的長期，這樣甜蜜濃重逾恒的狂熱，什麽人不在艶羨讚嘆，我們也曾向一切的情侶們驕視，我們的熱烈擁抱，狂吻，我們的···我們的誓同死生，我們的相抱對泣，我們的相互憐愛，這一切的一切·是我對你堅實的信條，我永不能相信你會决然不顧將我抛棄的！我至死也不會相信你忍心的將我抛棄！尤其在我們遭了不幸的這時期？親愛的，你回來吧！</p>
<p>然而一切過去的歡樂都成发現在的悲端了，我這顆心，這你在濃慵睡意籠罩着時所依枕的胸懷，現時的悲痛慘絶你是不難飿會的吧！但是我更願得有機會向你剖開，俟你重加認眞的認識這是一顆不可抛棄的心蕊丨丨我的心願的頂點是願你能夠在人生的長途中得到眞正的幸福，是願你不受絲毫的育苦。這我願付之以我所有的滴血與整個的生命！我的每一思縷都在爲着你呵！親愛的你回來吧！</p>
<p>愛的，你畢竟是失踪了，失踪後一個多月沒有信息了，經過我請託了許多朋友與律師，去窮天澈地的到處打聽與調查，知道你確是不曾受了什麽連累，而受拘捕。我痛苦之餘，不能不想到你是受了好人的誘騙了，薇！這種揣想，或是對你有所汚辱，然而我現在爲要探知你的究竟，不能不忍着痛淚作這樣的推測，唉！我的眼涙潮水般的湧出！親愛的你回來吧。</p>
<p>薇，即令你是受騙了，我相信也絶不是你的意志，我想你是一時的神經錯亂，你現在或是失了自由，因爲眞摯赤誠的愛的鮮花，是不容許任何環境物質所摧毁！請告訴我，在任何處所你可曾遇見過像我對你這樣周密愛護的心嗎？在你有一點病的時候，我是怎樣的關心喲！我敢發誓，我愛護你甚於愛護我自已的生命，親愛的，你回來吧。</p>
<p>我的心中有說不出的酸痛，爲了你的失踪我現在更感到我對於你的敎導未有盡到責任，你的一時的糊塗，一時的動搖，完全是因爲我愛你尚有未盡之處所致吧。我恨我，我决痞怨你，如其你能回來，今後我將更加會愛你，縱使你爲人所欺辱，身懷胎孕了，我也不會責你，氣你，我仍會一樣的更加愛你，貢我整個的心願，生命中整部的時間，以求得你的欣慰，因爲你是我生命中的一切，我的整個生命的寄託呵！在這三十多天以來，證明了我是不能一時離開你，少了你，我是活不成的喲！這三十多天以來！劇烈的悲痛不知使我昏倒了若干次！薇，我現在才知道，凡人對於他心愛的人的心願，若有絲毫未盡到處，他的慘痛比死還要難過的。假如你是因爲我愛你有未週之處而使你對我擯棄，那我内心的傷痛更是怎樣的慘絶呢？親愛的你回來吧！</p>
<p>唉，我們過去的一切，此時都使我想起，我想起了我們的小生命，那可愛的玲子，假使她還活在人間，她已會喊你媽媽與喊我爸爸了，她也會使你不忍心的將我們抛棄！唉！我更想起你這月餘以來是在怎樣一個熱煎的情形中過着生活，你的心臟病有否加重，這一要的一切都，使我心碎丨我心愛的妻，你切莫受人虚榮，那一時的熱情只是一時的衝動，外鄉人是靠不住的，他决不會眞心愛你，等到厭倦時便會把你抛棄，這種結局的憧影是保等的悽慘呀！你沒有想想，有誰眞心愛過有夫之婦呢？不過是看你現時年輕或是把你騙賣，也說不定上海社會的黑暗，你不在報上看見嗎？我一想到這裏，我的心如刀絞，我爲你悲痛，我不敢想呀丨親愛的，你這樣下去，又怎能見你的母親？那時時想念你的，那殘年衰老的母親？親愛的你回來吧！</p>
<p>我們自結合以來，艱苦的歷程是値得寳貴的，我倆逾恒的歡愛是値得贊嘆</p>

<p>的，我現在只在痛恨我自已·造成這次事變的錯過完全是由我自已·今春若不讓你去做事，决不會有現在悲　的境况。這完全是那恶劣環境把你染壞了，唉！愛的，你讓我看見你吧，從今後我也决不會再讓你去作事了，我要謁我的心力向你懺贖我已往的過失！親愛的，你回來吧！</p>
<p>北平有信呌我去，我爲了等你，我决不忍心走。你快回來，我們一起去吧！子光在一週前有信來說母親就要求上海，呌我倆到南京去接她，我回信說，呌人直接送她到上海，大槪不久就會來了，我已經租定了兩間安適的房子，她來後看不見你，她的失望與悲痛你會想見的吧！我最心愛的妻，你可憐老母吧！可憐快死的我吧！你趕快的回頭吧！我永遠是你的，你永遠是我的，我未死時，我將永遠等着你！你爲了救我的生命，你應當不顧其他，趕快回！來你可先到五姐家。你的良涙書，六月八號，（却酬）</p>

<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>一個驟雨初晴的星期日的下午·正是大世界門前最擁擠的時候··一羣羣的男的女的老的少的從裏面出來，又是一羣羣的男的女的老的少的從外面進去，馬路擠滿了一般拉着空車盼望着生意的黄包車夫。</p>
<p>「巡捕來了」！許多黄包車跟着車夫的腿向前飛跑，一個年老的拖着無力的腿落在最後面，倉皇地時時返顧後面的踱着方步的黄銅盆帽。</p>
<p>一輛一九三三式的雪佛萊汽車，從西面疾駛而來，幾乎和這逃命的黄包車碰撞，幸而斗的停住了。老邁的車夫顧慮着後面的黄銅盆帽，讓開了汽車仍舊往前跑，可是坐在汽車最前面的那個穿紡綢短衫袴的小白臉，突從車廂中跳下，把那黄包車死勁的拉了過來，這膂力可眞驚人，沒用的黄包車夫幾乎跟着車子向後倒了。</p>
<p>「赤丨塔，赤丨塔，······」從捲起了的紡綢袖子下面伸出來的手掌，在一個乾枯的老臉上發出了淸脆的聲音。同時，從雪佛萊汽車的裏層也傳過了淸脆的笑聲，可是這兩種「淸脆」顯得是不調和的。</p>
<p>這笑聲，眞是給捲着紡綢袖子的人一個絶大的鼓勵，他更奮勇了，他更凶狠地扭着車夫的全身，車夫東躱西避着，起先，他是把黄包車作盾牌的，後來連車子也給推翻了，他於是毫無抵抗地蟄伏着，只得以兩臂做掩護了。</p>
<p>黄銅盆帽這時候到了，黄包車夫在兩重的威脅这下更跼蹐了，他連忙縮回了撫摩着痛處的手，站起了蹲着的身子，收歛起悲悒的臉色，馴羊似的露了黄黑的牙齒低聲說着「我沒有什麽錯呀，······」可是黄銅盆帽的注意力終於給那個汽車夫滔滔的訴說吸引過去了，他訴說着這該死的黄包車夫是怎樣的犯了規則，險些了把他的Ｘ公館的四姨太嚇壞了，黄銅盆帽連連點頭，惡狠狠的望着黄包車夫，隨即搖出了日記簿記下了黄包車的號碼。</p>
<p>「阿三，可怎麽樣啦？」汽車裏面飛來的聲音。</p>
<p>「好了，少奶奶。」</p>
<p>「我們可要走了，有什麽事，回頭到公館裏再說。」</p>
<p>「是是，少奶奶！」紡綢袖了得意地回到汽車去，汽車的四周已圍滿了看閒的人，目光都集注在飛蓬的頭櫻桃的嘴的身人。汽車的喇叭響着，四周的人慢慢地散去。</p>
<p>黄銅盆帽在「勒勒」地撬黄包車的照會，黄包車夫哭喪着臉跪在地上哀求着　　　　　、</p>
<p>汽車夫阿三勝利地望了望跪在地上的黄包車夫，回頭朝着他的少奶奶一笑，把汽車開動了。</p>

<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我有一件困難事情，請先生指導。我的父母，於數年前，給我完下了一門親事；對方是同鄉嚴某的女兒。現在彼此都已成人，本應早日完聚：奈我經濟困難，致未成婚。誰在她在過去數年中，已與一龔姓者發生關係，今且孕已數月矣。以前我們雖耳聞其事，苦無眞憑實據，故亦未向交涉。月之某日，龔君竟請了律師，向我父提出解約的要求，俾遂他們同居之願。我父忠厚性成·允由龔某賠償損失，取消婚約。熟知到了交欵的日子，龔某竟硬欲核減銀數，並逼我你出立字據；余父乃大怒，事遂中罷。前途勢必涉訟，不知這事在法律上的觀點什樣？請即示覆，此請、</p>
<p>撰安方孟渭謹上</p>
<p>編者按··龔某與嚴姓女通姦，犯的是妨礙家庭罪··只有嚴女的家長，可以有權告訴，方君因爲沒有同嚴女結婚，不能行使夫權。不過嚴女旣已犯姦，且已懷孕，解約的條件是成立了。目下方君應根據這點，向法院提起解約之訴，並且可以要求以前用去的一切費用，此外還可以要求一筆撫慰金。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>二十七，復仇（一）</p>
<p>這一天是蘇部長五十三歲的壽辰，五夫人立意要給他熱鬧一下。據說；有些姨太太要給老爺做生日，爲的是可以在禮物中得着不少的好處，可是五夫人却不見得也如此，也許她並不在乎這些。</p>
<p>的確，以一個部長的交誼，當然很是廣闊。門生屬員是藉此機會孝敬上司，不得不送禮，舊親遠戚爲了要巴結巴結，也得送禮。去年送了，今年再送，明年還得送。部長的生日年年有，所以大家送禮的機會也就多得可以。</p>
<p>然而旣是送了禮，花了錢，當然吃一餐喜酒總是應該的。所以武貴因此着實賣力了一次。不過據五夫人的意思，最好是吃西菜，文明一點，然而武貴却固執着要用上等粤菜，後來五夫人到底由武貴作主了，想到他一世忠心，這一點小事，爲什麽不給他一點兒面子？</p>
<p>五夫人陪着蘇部長在賓客中間應酬一番，其後請了顧經理一同走進臥房來，只見荷香指揮着幾個女僕在擺着一桌精緻的酒席。於是顧經理少不了高笑道　　「原來我還要陪着壽星在這裏吃幾樣特别的好菜麽」？</p>
<p>「當然囉，難道顧部長也可以和普通的客人一樣看待嗎」？五夫人笑應着。　　蘇部長沒有什麽可說，只是一味的嘻笑。</p>
<p>今晚五夫人眞是賢淑，除了殷勤的獻酒之外，還揀着最珍貴的菜肴擺在蘇部長面前，然而對於顧經理也是同樣盛意的欵待。當然她自已也痛飲了幾杯，直到白眼珠也漲起了紅筋。不久，她站起來，很莊嚴的笑對着二人說··</p>
<p>「本來今天是老頭子的壽辰，照理我應當讓老頭子盡量的快樂快樂。不過有一椿事到底是非在今晚解决不可的，好在顧部長也不是别人，就將這封信讓你們談談罷」。</p>
<p>說着，她從衣袋裏掏出一封信來。蘇耕雲當然不免驚疑，然而到底馬上將信箋抽出來，一字一句的讀下去。</p>
<p>一親愛的柳絲··</p>
<p>近日來因忙於翻譯老賊和顧某的秘密文件，因數量太多，簡直忙了好幾個通夜。計有ＸＸ國特派駐支政務大臣的敕書，參謀本部的文件。其最關重要者爲指定某項軍事要議計劃書及合併立國之程序書。其與顧某有關者，有進行狀况報告書，ＸＸ國駐支政務處交際費的淸單，老賊存儲於台灣銀行的國際活動費餘欵，以及某某等項借欵之回扣，此項淸單存摺，共計爲五千七百餘萬元。　　現在吾愛最好告訴老賊，假如他能夠答應我們的條件，那末老賊的函件文稿均可送還，但顧某的財務大臨敕書及淸單等件，持以作證。吾愛丨老賊膽敢賣國，難道還不也賣老賊嗎？</p>
<p>秋風多勵，善自珍攝</p>
<p>愛　的文彬上」</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Reasons for the Xinjiang Incident <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Party Affairs Special Envoy Returns to Beijing to Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang Party Affairs Special Envoys Gong Bicheng, Zeng Qiwen, and Tao Mingyue arrived in Beijing on the 7th by a new Eurasia aircraft from Dihua. They met with Huang Musong in Lanzhou on the 8th and left Lanzhou on the morning of the 9th, arriving in Beijing at 5:30 PM. They spoke to reporters in detail about the course of the incident in the new province. The remote causes of the original incident dated back three years when Jin Shuren arbitrarily changed Hami into three counties and forcibly seized the fields of the Hui people, triggering riots. Ma Zhongying instigated trouble by sowing discord between the Han and Hui people. By last winter, the Hui leaders led the masses to occupy Shanshan. Jin Shuren sent provincial troops to suppress them, but they slaughtered the Hui people after capturing Shanshan, further enraging them. The Hui people of Qitai, Fukang, and Fuyuan assisted them. The provincial government then dispatched Sheng Shicai's troops to attack the Hui people of Shanshan and Turpan, while unrest was reported in the western part of Dihua. The entire northern route of the new province fell into a dangerous city. At the same time, the southern route's transportation was also completely destroyed, and the Han people were slaughtered to show revenge. In February of this year, the Hui people besieged Dihua for three days and three nights. At this time, the provincial army stationed in Hami was transferred north to the Guchengzi area. Ma Zhongying took the opportunity to go straight down to Shanshan. At this point, Chen Zhong, a central military investigator stationed in Dihua, and Tao Mingyue, Zhao Mingshou, and others contacted the military and civilians and forced Jin to leave to appease public anger. When Jin left for Suidong, he still planned to transfer Zhang Zixiang's division stationed in Yili for a counterattack. Zhang refused to obey the chaotic order, so Jin retreated to Tacheng and returned to his country via Russia. After Jin left, all sectors and ethnic groups in the provincial capital jointly organized the Xinjiang Provisional Provincial Government Maintenance Association, with Director of Education Liu Wenlong as chairman and Sheng Shicai as chairman of the Military Commission. Zheng Runcheng代 stood in before Sheng arrived. After Sheng returned to the province, he was elected as the temporary governor. The Maintenance Association appointed twenty-six members, with representatives from all ethnic groups participating. Ma Zhongying still used the excuse of attacking Jin and occupied Muleihe on May 5. The provincial government then dispatched Sheng Shicai and the troops of Ma, Su, Li, Du, and Wang Delin to resist. After a long stalemate, representatives were sent to Guchengzi and invited Ma to send representatives to Dihua. They set off on the 7th and are expected to arrive on the 9th to negotiate a peaceful solution. We have long planned to return to Beijing to report and wait to meet Huang Musong, so we have not been able to make the trip. We have a written report that has been secretly submitted to the central government and Chairman Chiang. We met Huang Musong in Lanzhou yesterday. Tao Mingyue is returning to Dihua with Huang Musong. As for the post-war affairs of the new province, one is to announce the central government's attention, and the other is to eliminate ethnic boundaries, then eliminate harsh policies and find ways to restrain Ma Zhongying's troops. Ma not only wants to seize political power in the new province but also colludes with Soviet Russia and has other conspiracies. Although his strength is not thick, he can use ethnic boundaries to incite the Hui people, making him more difficult to deal with. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>=The Development of the Anti-Japanese Trade Movement in the World=</p>
<p>=Truly a Matter of Life and Death for Japan=</p>
<p>=The Japanese Government Plans to Impose Retaliatory Tariffs on Britain=</p>
<p>=Major Cotton Industry Players Resolve to Boycott Indian Cotton=</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Army declared that the Japanese government considers the current development of the anti-Japanese trade movement to be a most serious problem.  The British Empire possesses one-fifth of the world's land, so the steps taken by the British and Indian governments to block Japanese goods are truly a matter of life and death for Japan.  Although the Japanese government has not yet decided whether to issue a protest, take retaliatory measures, or use both, the Japanese government still hopes to resolve the matter peacefully.  Other sources here claim that since the Indian government imposed a special tax of 75% on the assessed value of Japanese cloth, the Anglo-Japanese trade war has already begun.  Yesterday, the Osaka Japan Cotton Yarn Exporters Association held a meeting and resolved to boycott raw cotton from India. Representatives from the "Big Five" cotton mills were sent to the Administrative Committee to demand immediate implementation.  It is reported that the plan still needs to be passed by the general assembly on June 13 before it can be implemented. At that time, all Japanese cotton mills in "Manchukuo" in China will uniformly join the movement to boycott Indian goods. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Ministry authorities have been studying fundamental policies regarding trade relations with Britain with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Finance. As a result, it has been decided that Japan will impose retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the British Empire across its entire territory.  Relevant authorities have now begun planning a tariff war against Britain.  This plan is expected to be completed within the current month, and will be submitted to the Emperor for consultation with the Privy Council. The order will be announced and implemented as early as July 1. Currently, the goods being considered for increased tariffs include British-made machinery, Indian cotton, pig iron, Australian wool, wheat, and Canadian lumber. That is, the retaliatory tariffs will apply high rates, even outright prohibition, to both finished products and raw materials. (9th, Japanese News Alliance)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the intensification of the international economic war, some countries are adopting exclusionary and prohibitive tariffs. Japan, on the other hand, is bound by the single tariff system established in the 41st year of Meiji (1908) and lacks any defensive measures. To remedy this deficiency, some within the Foreign Ministry are advocating for the implementation of a dual tariff system for economic defense. Foreign Minister Uchida has already begun informal negotiations with the Ministry of Finance regarding the revision of the tariff system, which has attracted considerable attention from all quarters. The fundamental focus of this dual tariff system is to establish two types of tariff rates: ① a low tariff rate applicable to countries with which Japan has trade treaties, and ② a high tariff rate applicable to countries with which Japan has no treaties. This would replace the current uniform tariff system. The latter would be applied to countries that have renounced trade treaties with Japan, treat Japan as a country without treaties, and establish unduly prohibitive high tariff barriers, adopting an equivalent retaliatory tariff rate. (9th, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(London) A joint committee composed of representatives from various British industrial and commercial organizations (including textile manufacturers) has requested the British government to immediately cancel the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty and establish a preferential system throughout the country to exclude Japanese goods, or even establish a supervisory system for some imported Japanese goods. The committee strongly advocates this proposal, believing that this measure should be adopted before any negotiations are conducted with the Japanese. The British House of Commons has also raised discussions about the competition from Japanese goods in the British market. The severity of this competition can be clearly seen in the material published in the Conservative newspaper, the Morning Post. In the first quarter of this year, Japanese goods imported into Britain reached ¥17,190,000, while in the same quarter last year they were only ¥14,429,000. Imports into British India were ¥47,916,000 in the first quarter of this year, compared to ¥31,075,000 last year. Imports into Australia this year were ¥9,951,000, compared to ¥4,882,000 last year. Imports into South Africa this year were ¥4,847,000, compared to ¥1,758,000 last year. Imports into British East Africa this year were ¥4,748,000, compared to ¥2,649,000 last year. Imports into New Zealand this year were ¥1,045,000, compared to ¥537,000 last year. The Morning Post also pointed out that the extent of Japanese goods penetrating the British Empire's market has been accelerating, especially in April and May of this year. (8th, Tass)</p>

<p>Informal Contacts in London and Paris</p>
<p>Drafting of Disarmament Convention Continues (Geneva) The General Commission on Disarmament adjourned today in a pessimistic atmosphere until June 27. Japanese representative Sato had already stated before the adjournment that unless all countries abolish aircraft carriers, Japan cannot accept the provisions prohibiting aerial bombardment. In addition, many other points have not been agreed upon. Representatives of the conference stated that they do not have strong hopes of reaching a preliminary agreement during the adjournment period. Although the General Commission passed a motion today to adopt the British draft as the basis for the Disarmament Convention, there are still some changes to be made. The methods and the extent of the reductions will generally follow the British plan. During the adjournment period, private contacts will continue to be made in London and Paris. Chairman Henderson can also convene an emergency meeting in London if necessary. The drafting committee will continue to meet in Geneva to complete its work. (8th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson left for London tonight to continue contact regarding disarmament issues, following the policy decided here. Before leaving, he told reporters that he hopes to obtain the necessary agreement so that a draft Disarmament Convention can be completed and presented to the main committee on June 27. If necessary, he plans to convene the main committee in London because he hopes that the final convention can be negotiated and ready for signing after the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly this autumn. (9th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the government has issued new instructions to the Japanese representative to the Disarmament Conference, stating that Japan is adjacent to special countries such as China and Russia, and therefore opposes the judgment of third parties regarding acts of aggression. It is reported that these instructions oppose placing the state of military preparedness under the supervision of a permanent national organization. At the same time, Japan has also made reservations regarding compliance with the consultation convention. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Even After the Establishment of the Four-Power Pact, Britain Maintains</p>
<h3 id="e41">A Detached Policy <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Progress in Franco-Italian Relations</p>
<p>Anyone reading the White Paper published by the British Foreign Office today knows that the British government views the Four-Power Pact as a measure for the signatory countries of the League of Nations to cooperate more closely and comply with existing peace treaties. The documents published in the White Paper indicate that Britain is only joining a movement to make existing treaties fully effective and has not increased its obligations regarding European affairs. One document, a letter from Foreign Secretary Simon to the British ambassador to Italy, states that your Excellency should clearly understand that the government's accession to the new treaty does not imply an expansion of its obligations in European affairs, and that this treaty cannot replace the League of Nations Covenant. Observers have said that this instruction implies that although Britain will cooperate fully to maintain peace, it will still maintain a certain degree of detachment and independent action. (8th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) In Foreign Secretary Simon's instruction to the British ambassador to Italy to represent Britain in signing the Four-Power Pact, it was explained that Britain's compliance with the Four-Power Pact does not imply an expansion of Britain's obligations in European affairs. Tonight, British official circles issued a statement emphasizing Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement yesterday that the Four-Power Pact is not a scheme for the four powers to impose their will on other countries, nor is it intended to establish a European governing body, nor has there ever been any intention to establish a hegemonic authority in European affairs. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour told a Reuters reporter today that the establishment of the Four-Power Pact has indeed made progress in Franco-Italian relations. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour had previously given verbal assurances to the Little Entente countries regarding the Four-Power Pact, and now he has reaffirmed them in writing. The French government also plans to publish a Yellow Book, making all documents related to the Four-Power Pact public. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>The Prague Ceteka news agency published a letter from French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour to the Czech ambassador to Paris, stating that France's views on the issue of treaty revision will not change due to the Four-Power Pact. France has always believed that the issue of treaty revision should be strictly in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. Czech Ambassador Osusky replied that Czechoslovakia fully agrees with Paul-Boncour's interpretation. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Diplomatic Political News Agency declared that the significance of the Four-Power Pact lies in continuing the efforts of the Locarno Treaty, so that the former enemy countries in the European War can restore proper diplomatic relations and the problems left over from the post-war period can be resolved. The news agency highly praised Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and said that attention should be paid to the spirit of the Four-Power Pact. Newspapers have pointed out one by one the benefits that Germany can obtain from the Four-Power Pact. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>The Vatican: The Holy See has a very good impression because the Four-Power Pact happened to be established during the 1900th anniversary of Jesus' crucifixion. Vatican personnel hope that after the Four-Power Pact has been implemented for ten years, humanity's war-loving mentality can be completely eliminated. (8th, Havas)</p>

<p>France Insists on Establishing a Supervisory System Before Agreeing to Abolish Armaments</p>
<p>The United States Can Agree to This Point, But Britain Still Opposes</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the semi-official communiqué released last night, the three-power talks here have not had any results, and there have been no substantial decisions in principle. France has abandoned the idea of seeking new guarantees of mutual assistance from other countries, but insists on the proposal of supervising armaments and requires the publication of military budget plans. It is widely believed that the United States can now agree to the supervision of armaments, but Britain still opposes it. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The three-nation conference chaired by US representative Davis was held at the French Foreign Ministry. It is widely believed that it has achieved its goal of eliminating the main difficulties of the Disarmament Conference. This move has allowed Britain and the United States to learn what level of security France needs to reduce its heavy land armaments. It is reported that the British and American representatives have not stated the degree of management they are prepared to agree to, but it is now known what France's minimum needs are. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French, British, and American three-nation conference ended at 5:30 p.m. today, and a communiqué was immediately released, stating that the three representatives exchanged views in an atmosphere of mutual trust and friendship, and discussed disarmament work and the work that remains to be done to achieve disarmament. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the three-nation representative conference, French Prime Minister Daladier declared, "We had friendly talks, and the British and American representatives were extremely sincere. As for France, it also has its plans and theories." US representative Davis said that this meeting was only an exchange of views, the talks were very cordial, and some progress has been made as a result. The three representatives have not prepared for a second meeting. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) France maintains the plans and theories declared by Prime Minister Daladier. France's main propositions are as follows: it will no longer ask other countries to provide new guarantees for the issue of mutual assistance. France is prepared to abolish certain types of armaments or hand them over to the League of Nations in order to achieve disarmament, but for France to do so, the following conditions must be met: ① establish a permanent, automatic, and mutual supervisory system and prove that it is indeed effective; ② military expenditures must be made public; ③ the signatory countries of the Disarmament Convention must be notified in advance of what measures will be taken against those who violate the provisions of the Disarmament Convention. Only after these conditions are met will France agree to engage in disarmament in the aforementioned sense. US public opinion has gradually approved of the supervisory system, while British people remain silent, but believe that it would be beneficial to first implement a small-scale supervisory system in Europe. In this way, the method of phased disarmament will be easier to achieve. (8th, Havas)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Today, the Communist Party's newspaper, Pravda, again denounced Christian General Feng Yuxiang as Japan's agent in North China, saying that Feng had also accepted the assistance of Japanese agents during his last opposition to the Nanjing government, and this time is no different. The newspaper said that the Japanese are using Feng to drive out the Nanjing troops in North China that are unfavorable to them. Feng's rebellion has not only accelerated the withdrawal of Nanjing's forces from the Pingjin area, but has also promoted the attempt by the Anfu clique and other Japanese "Manchurian" agents to build an independent state in North China. The newspaper continued, "Although Feng is using the pretext of defending the country and resisting Japan, he is actually Japan's most active agent. His actions in Chahar and Suiyuan will inevitably cause turmoil, and Japanese imperialism will be able to use the pretext of suppressing this turmoil to occupy Zhangjiakou." (8th, Tass)</p>

The Japanese ambassador did not mention this matter during his visit this time. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi's visit to Nanjing to call on government authorities is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 10th. It is inaccurate that he protested the increase in commercial tariffs to our side. Regarding this matter, not only did Ariyoshi not raise any protests, but even the Japanese government itself knows that there is no reason to protest the increase in sovereignty. The talk about contacting on Sino-Japanese issues is even more inaccurate. In addition, the newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, Mr. Hidaka Noburo, hosted a lunch on the 9th for Vice Minister Xu Mo and various directors of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of socializing.

<h3 id="e49">A Real Turning Point in the Situation in the East <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Eastern question has deteriorated to this point due to the lack of strength in our country. Without guaranteeing genuine peace, the British relationship is also very important. Initially, Britain was an observer of Japan's military actions in the Northeast. It sat and watched Japan prevent the eastward expansion of Soviet power and suppress the upward development of the Chinese national movement. By the time Japan occupied the four northeastern provinces and threatened Pingjin, our China suffered unprecedented damage, and the international market was also strongly shaken. The British Empire could neither change its historical attitude towards the Soviet Union, nor could it restrain Japan. It had no choice but to decisively abandon its free trade stance and strive to implement the "Economic Alliance" policy decided at last year's Ottawa British Empire Economic Conference. It attempted to achieve economic self-sufficiency within the country, contain Europe and resist North America in the West, and contain Japan's "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance" in the East, in order to maintain its destiny of dominating the world. However, both Japan and England are island nations. Although they both have the intention of preventing the Soviet Union in the Far East market, their commodity trade, whether cotton products or other refined products, is in a position of opposition and competition and is not easy to reconcile. Not only that, but Japanese products, especially cotton products, have jumped into the Indian market, and African regions are also flooded with Japanese goods. Britain has changed from master to guest and is still in a passive position.</p>
<p>Judging from the general situation of the world, it is not easy for Britain to maintain its position in various autonomous territories and colonies. The Soviet Union, as an emerging country, is powerfully based in Eurasia and has a great influence on India and China. It seems that it has no choice but to unite with Japan. However, Britain, as the most educated country in capitalism, and with its long history of international diplomacy, is unlikely to easily show weakness to Japan and fall into its reputation. Moreover, the World Economic Conference is about to open. If the conference is successful, Britain will be able to obtain the greatest benefits during this period. Even if the conference fails unfortunately, Britain has considerable preparations to implement its superior isolated policy and maintain its stable position during the economic panic period in recent years. The production figures and export trade of the United States, Germany, and France have fallen from 11% to 48%. The deepening degree of panic can be seen. Britain abandoned the gold standard early and its market is also vast, so it has been able to barely maintain the situation in 1931 without falling. This year it is even more active, even abandoning commercial treaties with some countries and re-signing new treaties, forcing its opponents to make the greatest concessions. For example, Britain must account for 80% of the total amount of coal imported by Denmark each year, and 75,000 tons of steel. Argentina's debt to Britain will be exchanged for the purchase of goods. Denmark is used to control Germany, and Argentina is used to control the United States. In the future, it will move forward and apply the same methods to other industrialized countries. India's increase in tariffs on cotton products from 10% to 75% and Africa's launch of closure methods are all intended to threaten Japan. In other words, it is the implementation of the "Economic Alliance."</p>
<p>Japan's blocking of the Soviet Union is being advocated everywhere among the countries, claiming to be working hard to implement it. It has been more than a year now. What are the results? Japan relies on this to value itself and secretly shows goodwill to the Soviet Union. How can Britain not know about this kind of behavior? It allows Japan to act arbitrarily and gain its own benefit. Therefore, politically, England and Japan cannot but support each other from Central Asia to the Heilongjiang and Jilin to consolidate the vested interests of the Eastern market. But in terms of economics, spinning and weaving is one of the most important links in the British economic system. Britain still wants to try its best to maintain its position in the Chinese market, and it does not hesitate to sacrifice some of the more distant benefits in exchange. Moreover, India and Africa are originally under the control of British forces. In the scope of the British Empire's economic alliance, it is natural to want to make it more and more solidified. Within India and Africa, it strives to take active offensive measures against foreign goods, which is to expand the market for British products. Japanese products are its current giant enemy, and it is the target of attack. Even if the political relationship between England and Japan makes it necessary to coordinate the economic opposition, how easy is it to coordinate the so-called "Japan-India Trade" follow-up negotiations? Therefore, Japan's isolation will be even greater.</p>

<p>The German government announces the postponement of foreign debt remittances</p>
<h3 id="e52">Implementation Starting July 1st <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Banks Established After the Banking Crisis Must Still Pay</p>
<p>Dawes-Young Loans Agreement Temporarily Unaffected</p>
<p>London to Convene Creditors' Meeting</p>
<p>(Berlin) All kinds of debts borrowed by Germany before July 1931 have now been declared to be postponed for repayment. According to the explanation of Dr. Schacht, the President of the German National Bank, Germany's current financial position was caused by the banking crisis at that time. Debts borrowed by Germany after July 1931 will be repaid as far as possible. Schacht claimed that the National Bank had invited Germany's long-term creditors and the Bank for International Settlements to attend the creditors' meeting in London on June 13. From July 1, the remittance of Germany's foreign debt repayment will be postponed. The order will be available approximately tomorrow. According to this postponement clause, the Dawes and Young loans will all be temporarily suspended for repayment, and the existing agreement will not be affected for the time being. However, Schacht hopes to find a way to reduce the burden for Germany during negotiations in London next week. The so-called remittance postponement does not mean stopping the repayment of principal and interest in marks, but only stopping the repayment in foreign currencies. German private debtors must pay into a special exchange fund managed by the National Bank. The National Bank promises to exchange marks for foreign currencies when all foreign currencies in Germany are sufficient. Bank rediscount gold debts, totaling US$46 million, will mature in July, and will now be paid in advance in US dollar bills. In this way, Germany can obtain a surplus of 30 million marks at the current dollar price. The amount of German debt affected by this postponement, calculated in British currency, is about £86.5 million. The principal and interest of this debt cannot be remitted. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the provisions for the suspension of debt payments have been notified by the cabinet last night, their publication will have to wait until Friday or Saturday. However, today, the President of the National Bank, Dr. Schacht, announced the news about this matter, stating that the suspension of payment of various foreign debts will not be implemented until July 1. The reason for setting this date is actually to allow Germany and its creditors to continue consultations with the London Conference next week, in order to accommodate the opinions of the creditors as much as possible. Schacht said that Germany's actions are those of an honorable debtor, who is wholeheartedly willing to fully repay its debts, but is unable to repay due to the unavailability of foreign currencies. This is not the fault of the German National Bank, but because all the warnings issued by Germany since 1924 regarding imprudent lending have not been heeded by various countries. Therefore, the real cause of this matter is the economic policy errors of various countries over the past fourteen years. Germany currently owes various countries private debts amounting to approximately £1 billion, half of which are short-term loans, and another £200 million have separate permanent contracts, which may not be subject to the suspension of payment. As for other creditors, they will be treated equally, that is, the holders of Dawes and Young bonds will not receive any preferential treatment. The meeting between the National Bank and the creditors has now been scheduled to be held in London on the 13th of this month. Representatives of long-term loan creditors and the Bank for International Settlements will all attend at that time. However, the outcome of this meeting cannot be determined by Germany alone, but depends on whether various countries can cooperate. (Guomin News Agency, 8th)</p>

He also put forward the opinion that raising the price of silver is the most important plan at present, as raising the price of silver can increase the purchasing power of silver-producing countries and revitalize the Far East market.

<h3 id="e57">Stabilizing Exchange Rates: The British Example Can Be Followed <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(London) Stabilizing exchange rates is the most important issue here, even tariffs and other issues have taken a back seat. Since the United States created the concept of a gold unit, financial experts here have said that the US plan can be combined with the British method of stabilizing exchange rates, which has already been implemented effectively, to find a suitable basis for stabilizing international exchange rates, so that the exchange markets of various countries do not differ greatly from the specified exchange rates. The British method is to establish a stabilization exchange rate fund. At the beginning of 1932, the pound exchange rate fluctuated, often rising and falling between US$3.25 and US$3.80 in ninety days, which troubled merchants. The British government allocated a stabilization exchange rate fund of £150 million, and secretly used it to manipulate the world exchange market and equalize the pound exchange rate. Before the United States abandoned the gold standard, it was very effective. Today, this fund has increased to £350 million. Therefore, financial experts say that once the currency prices of various countries are stabilized and the exchange rates are agreed upon with each other, a large international equalization exchange market fund can be established by the major countries together and entrusted to a neutral institution such as the International Bank for good use, in order to stabilize the exchange rates of various countries, curb the manipulation of speculators, and eliminate rumors and panic.

<p>Ministry of Finance Finds Compilation Difficult</p>
<p>Hualian, Tokyo, 9th According to estimates based on this year's budget, Japan's budget for next year has a deficit of approximately 800 million yuan. It is reported that the Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Finance intends to reduce it to 700 million yuan, which will be supplemented by 500 million yuan of public debt, approximately 100 million yuan of revenue from tax increases, and a reduction of 100 million yuan from established expenses. If the budget is compiled according to the Accounting Bureau's plan, expenses for emergency relief, Manchurian military expenses, and military expansion will all be subject to reduction. Reducing emergency relief expenses would lead to a split with the Seiyukai, and reducing military expenses would not be approved by the military.

<p>With the United States Pulling Strings Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Guomin, Havana, 7th Cuban President Machado declared today that he will thoroughly reform internal affairs, and stated that after some reforms are implemented, he will retire to give way to the virtuous. It is reported that the Cuban President just declared to reporters a week ago that he believed that acceding to the demands of political enemies and resigning midway would hinder the government's prestige and set a bad precedent. Today, he suddenly proposed adding a vice president to jointly handle government affairs as a step towards retirement, and intends to reform internal affairs to ensure that people have greater freedom and avoid imprisonment without trial due to political suspicion. It is believed that the strong hands of the United States are pulling strings behind the scenes to promote this. Since US President Roosevelt was elected, there has been a movement here to ask the United States to intervene. Although Roosevelt hesitated and was unwilling to do so, he was deeply concerned about the unrest in Cuba's political situation. It is reported that he has made some representations through diplomatic channels.</p>

<p>A Tragic Incident at a Japanese Respect for the Aged Society</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, 5th In Osaka-Kobe's Uozaki, a Shangchi Society was held on the 3rd. 193 people attended, all of whom were elderly gentlemen and village councilors from the suburbs of Mikage, Sumiyoshi, Honjo, and Seido, totaling 330 people. On this day, after the meeting, all members took their lunch food back to their hometowns and distributed it to their families and neighbors, in order to express their intention to extend their lives and increase their longevity. Unexpectedly, all those who consumed the food were completely poisoned starting at 11:00 pm, suffering from abdominal pain and vomiting. Approximately thousands of people were affected, and hospitals in various towns were unable to accommodate them. Pharmacies everywhere were struggling to fill prescriptions, and the night was filled with disturbances and crying. In addition, the elderly suddenly suffered from serious illnesses and died one after another. Even those who were diagnosed and treated by doctors had a long way to go. Tanaka, the police chief, Yasui, the principal of the normal school, and others were also in critical condition. In particular, because the society used the elementary school as a venue, all the staff members from the principal down were severely poisoned. Upon hearing the news, the Hyogo Prefectural Sanitation Department, in addition to urgently sending epidemic prevention doctors to the Ting Song Ting Restaurant to seriously inspect food materials, also dispatched dozens of doctors from the Hyogo Prefectural Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital, divided into three shifts, to make every effort to provide relief.</p>

<p>Caused by Damp Ammunition</p>
<p>Remnants Still Smoldering Yesterday</p>
<p>Dentsu, Hamamatsu, 9th The Ministry of the Army has investigated the cause of the armory explosion at the Hamamatsu 7th Air Regiment, and has now largely clarified that it was not related to bombs dropped during transportation. Due to the impact of high humidity on the gunpowder used in the illuminating bombs in the armory, it spontaneously exploded and spread to nearby bombs and gasoline, causing the tragedy. According to the Military Affairs Bureau, the cause is currently under investigation, and there was no intrusion by outsiders, nor was it caused by bombs falling to the ground during transportation, because the safety devices of the bombs are very strict and difficult to explode. Therefore, the cause is outside the bombs. In addition, the 40 heavy and light bomber aircraft that were damaged suffered a loss of approximately 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Hamamatsu, 9th The fuel depot that caught fire due to the bomb explosion on the evening of the 7th has not been extinguished and continues to burn. Unexploded bombs are scattered nearby. The authorities have dispatched a large number of soldiers to collect them to avoid danger. According to the Army authorities, the number of deaths and injuries is 17, and two people are missing. 30 aircraft were damaged, and 6,000 boxes of aviation gasoline were burned. 360 houses of nearby residents were damaged.</p>

<p>But Still in High Spirits</p>
<p>Pressing Forward</p>
<p>Guomin, Pyrovsk, The repair of American aviator Mattern's airplane was faster than expected. After resting twice this morning, he departed at 4:10 to fly to Krasnoyarsk, where there is a complete repair shop. According to Mattern, after arriving there, he may make more permanent repairs. Mattern has no hope of setting a new round-the-world record after this setback, but he is still in high spirits and not at all discouraged. He spent the night here last night due to wind and rain. He had a simple meal before departing this morning, but carried a lot of food to prevent being forced to land in remote areas again.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 8th Mattern had to land in Prokopyevsk, 378 miles from Novosibirsk, due to a leak in the oil pipe. Mattern discovered the leak four hours after departing from Omsk, but continued to push forward until the smell of oil almost made him lose consciousness before landing the plane. According to Mattern, he told Soviet officials that he plans to continue his journey as soon as the mechanic repairs the plane. He hopes to continue flying within five to ten hours. Mattern began flying out on Saturday morning, and had flown 7,275 miles when he arrived in Prokopyevsk. Some people wrote down the time in his diary, and Mattern replied that he no longer remembered it, but believed that he landed one hour after flying over Novosibirsk. Mattern climbed out of the plane by himself, but was so exhausted that he could hardly stand upright. He was sent to a nearby house by the crowd, and the owner of the house prepared a bed and told him to sleep. Although Mattern was extremely tired, he was unwilling to go to bed, and only sat quietly for a few minutes to rest before going to see his plane again. Mattern told people that he vomits every time he enters the cockpit, and he can only feel at ease when he does not smell the oil.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 9th According to news here, American aviator Mattern departed from Krasnoyarsk this morning and arrived in Chita at 11:55 am.</p>

<p>Representatives From All Sides Flocking to Guangzhou</p>
<h3 id="e82">Discussing How to Deal With the Current Situation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence Recently, due to the issue of the current situation, representatives from all sides have been dispatched to the south one after another to contact the Southwest authorities to discuss solutions. In order to receive representatives from all sides, the Southwest Political Council specially publicly elected member Zou Lu yesterday to come forward to contact and consult the situation of all parties. Those who attended the meeting on that day included Yu Kexun, representative of Feng Yuxiang, Hou Dongming, representative of Fang Zhenwu, Xu Buyang and Ou Zhinan, representatives of Sun Dianying, Zhang Peiqian, representative of He Jian, and Zhang Yunliang, representative of Wang Jialie, totaling more than ten people. According to reports, a complete plan has been made as a result of the meeting, but according to insiders, it has not been very smooth. It is found that Zhang Peiqian, representative of He Jian, has been discussing important matters with the Southwest Political Council and the military authorities for days. The opinions of Guangdong and Hunan provinces on resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists have become consistent. Zhang believes that there is no need to stay in Guangdong, and took the opportunity to come to Guangdong to go to Guangxi to discuss various relations between Hunan and Guangxi with the military and political leaders of Guangxi Province. Zhang took the round trip to Guangdong on the morning of the 3rd and went to Wuzhou, transferred to Nanning, and visited Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. It is heard that He Jian of Hunan has informed that since Zhang has gone to Guangxi, he will send Wu Jialu, the chief of the staff office, from Changsha to Guangdong to discuss military affairs with Guangdong, and intends to set up a liaison office in Guangdong for liaison. Hou Liming, representative of Fang Zhenwu, came to Guangdong this time to report to the Southwest Political Council on the recent actions of Fang's troops and ask the Southwest for spiritual and material assistance. It is said that Fang Zhenwu's troops have approximately 30,000 people. When they opened to the PingSui Road from Shanxi, they were blocked by a certain friendly army. After many negotiations, they reached their destination. Although the distance between PingSui Road and Xuanhua is still far from the front line, and there has been no contact, the military expenditure has reached more than 300,000 after three months of marching. Currently, the military expenditure is extremely tight and needs to be replenished urgently. Fang's troops are currently in contact with Feng Yuxiang, but they are not absolutely under Feng's command, but they have the same position on resisting Japan. Hou's mission to Guangdong has been completed, and he plans to go to Guangxi tomorrow (6th) to meet Li Zongren, contact him, and then go to Fujian Province to visit Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, etc., and then return north. According to Qian representative Zhang Yunliang, Wang Jialie of Qian Province telegraphed on the 30th of last month, expressing his attitude. The original telegram stated, "I am willing to do my best to support the great plan of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists." As for the internal disputes in Qian Province, the representative and Mao Yuebo and others, who stayed in Guangdong, once contributed two methods to Wang Jialie: 1. Please ask You Guocai to lead his troops north to resist Japan. The departure expenses have been agreed to be allocated by the Southwest, and the regular expenses will be borne by Qian Province. 2. If You is unwilling to lead his troops north to resist Japan, Qian Province will allocate travel expenses and send him abroad, and his troops will be taken over by Wang Jialie. Soon You replied that he opposed it, and the reasons he held were that the proposal to jointly go to the country's crisis (according to the above two conditions) was Cai's ambition. This is the entire problem of Guizhou, not Cai's sole problem, and a complete plan must be discussed with each other. If only a certain part is designated to go out, it is not difficult to imagine whether there are other intentions, and I am afraid that it will cause obstacles. How is Shao Wu as a person? Can he maintain the situation in Guizhou? You have a deep understanding. Peace movement, after repeated exhortations to Shao Wu from all directions, has he sincerely accepted? You should also know it well. You love your homeland and want to promote peace. You still hope to have just claims, and because of your own selfishness, you will purchase and transport weapons and ammunition, and add fuel to the fire, which will encourage the chaos in Qian. It is very undesirable. According to this, the Qianzhong You Wang two factions are still going to extremes, and the Qian affair may not be resolved overnight. (June 5th)</p>
<p>After Feng's Telegram</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yan Xishan's Attitude <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Advocates Cutting Troops to Save the Country</p>
<p>Beiping Special News Xu Yongchang, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, arrived in Beiping yesterday from Taiyuan, and arrived at the West Station at 7:00 this morning. After getting off the bus, he went to the Yinghuan Hotel to rest. This reporter visited this afternoon to inquire about Yan Xishan's attitude towards the current situation. According to Xu, Yan Xishan was quite silent after Feng telegraphed to take office, but he expressed that he would do his best to support anyone who is beneficial to the country. There is nothing to say about Feng's matter. The criticisms of the Shanxi people on the establishment of a truce agreement between China and Japan are roughly the same, because all parties believe that there are other weaknesses in the armistice in North China, and it is not a defeat. Yan believes that saving the country still requires cutting troops. Shanxi Province has established a Military Reorganization Committee, which is doing its best to promote troop cuts. A considerable number of people have been implemented. Although the last batch has not been implemented, it will definitely be done in the future, because the country is only supporting heavy troops, wasting military spending in vain, and it is impossible to reduce expenditure without cutting troops, and it is impossible to save the poor without reducing expenditure. At the same time, both symptomatic and fundamental treatment should start with the development of industry. Recently, Chinese markets have been flooded with foreign goods, and the annual leakage is countless. If we continue to follow this path, foreigners will not use force to destroy China, and China itself will be invaded economically, and it will fall into the place of subjugation. Foreigners use commercial warfare, and they can destroy us without spending a single soldier or bullet. This kind of crisis is really terrible. Chinese people should broaden their horizons and focus on this point. Even if they suffer temporary humiliation, they will eventually have a day of revival. I (Xu said himself) came to Beiping this time for no other important task, just to visit Chairman Huang (Fu) and report on Shanxi's political affairs. Yan Xishan is still stationed in Taiyuan. The Jin army Li Fuying, Zhao Chengzhou, and other troops have temporarily retreated to Datong due to factual relations. According to general observations, Xu's visit this time should be to request instructions on the border defense issues between Jin and Sui. (7th)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Han River Water Level Soars <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>=Water Mark at 39 Feet, Over a Foot Higher Than in the Past 20 Years=</p>
<p>=Xia Douyin Cables Asking for Instructions on Flood Prevention Measures=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the severe flood disaster in Hubei Province twenty years ago, the people suffered greatly and became terrified at the sight of water. Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has persisted for weeks, and mountain floods have erupted again. Both the Han and Xiang rivers have risen simultaneously and continue to rise rapidly. The Hankou water mark has reached 39 feet and 4 inches, more than a foot higher than the water level in the same month of the previous year. Regarding flood prevention matters, the General Headquarters had instructed the Hubei Provincial Government to follow the measures drafted by the National Economic Council. After discussion, the Provincial Government decided not to accept them and specifically sent Li Fanyi, the Director of the Construction Department, to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, requesting changes. In addition, Chairman Xia Douyin sent a cable to Chiang Kai-shek to appeal and ask for instructions on everything. The original cable is recorded as follows: "Nanchang, To Chairman Chiang: Since the beginning of summer in Hubei Province, torrential rains have continued for days, and the river flow has risen sharply, even higher than the water level in the same month of the twentieth year. Recently, we received an order from your department to issue flood prevention measures for the Han River dikes drafted by the National Economic Council, stipulating that local governments should be responsible for flood prevention matters. The various engineering offices of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau will provide practical guidance and assistance. Flood prevention materials should be purchased by local governments according to actual needs. If the project is huge and the local financial resources are indeed insufficient, other governments may request the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to report to the National Economic Council and forward it to your department for verification and appropriate subsidies, etc. This is completely contrary to the principles of the flood prevention regulations promulgated by the former Water Conservancy Bureau in May of the twentieth year, and the flood prevention measures of the twenty-first year, where the dike bureau was responsible for the engineering and the funds were raised and distributed by the dike bureau. I humbly submit that after the two bureaus of water conservancy and dike engineering in this province were ordered to be abolished, the dike engineering was entirely the responsibility of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the local governments have no right to intervene. The local governments have no detailed knowledge of the previous construction plans and the current dangerous situations. Moreover, bandit troubles in central Hubei have just been pacified, and the vitality has not yet recovered. The county governments with dikes are busy comforting the people and urging taxes, and have no such strength and economy to bear the responsibility of flood prevention. Although there is an exception provision for appropriate subsidies if needed too much, it is necessary to request the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to report to the National Economic Council and forward it to your department for verification before it can be appropriately allocated. The exchange of official documents takes time, and I am afraid that the funds will not be approved before the dike collapses. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau is the only competent authority for dike engineering. When things come to a head, it actually shirks its responsibility to the local government and takes the position of assistance. The reasons and principles are unfair, and delays can be predicted. Looking ahead, I cannot help but shudder. This has been brought up at the meeting of this government, and it was decided that the flood prevention measures drafted by the National Economic Council are difficult to approve and publicly recommend Commissioner Li Fanyi to meet with you in person to request instructions. The record is on file. Now, Li Fanyi is being sent to present the report. The flood season has arrived, and at this critical moment, the lives of tens of millions of people are at stake. There is no room for hesitation. Therefore, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau's Qiu Zhidao and Cheng Renwu have discussed and divided the principles of the flood prevention work of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau's project teams and the local governments. All project command, surveying, layout, and supply of funds and materials are the responsibility of the various Jianghan Engineering Bureau offices. On the one hand, the provincial government selects engineering personnel familiar with the project to assist according to the project teams and is responsible for supervising local officials in handling recruitment and other local matters that should be compared. After Director Yang Silian returns to Hankou from the Xiang River, a decision will be made to proceed. In addition to ordering Commissioner Li Fanyi to follow the resolution and meet with you in person to explain the process in detail, this is respectfully telegraphed to you. If you approve of the above-mentioned agreed work principles as feasible, please instruct the National Economic Council to order compliance and clearly change the proposed flood prevention measures. Urgent requests, respectfully awaiting instructions, Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Xia Douyin. (Eighth day)"</p>
<h3 id="e85">Guangdong Provincial National Defense Construction Committee Established <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>丨Chen Jitang Appointed Chairman丨</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial military authorities, considering the urgent national crisis and that Guangdong is located by the sea, and all coastal national defense fortresses must be actively organized and arranged for contingencies, issued 30 million yuan in national defense bonds, which were distributed by the Finance Department to various counties according to their level for subscription and sale. Since the issuance, the counties have been successively remitting the proceeds from the sale of national defense bonds for the purpose of repairing fortresses and adding new weapons. The Guangdong National Defense Construction Committee is responsible for arranging national defense matters in Guangdong Province. The committee consists of Chen Jitang, Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Li Yangjing, Miao Peinan, Li Jiechi, Huang Guangrui, Zhang Zhiying, Wu Fan, Zhou Zhi, Zhang Guoyuan, and others as members, with Chen Jitang as the chairman. Preparations have been underway for several months, and were finally completed at the end of last month. It was officially established on the first of this month and began operations immediately. All staff members of the committee are concurrently serving personnel drawn from various departments of the First Group Army Headquarters. Li Jiechi, the commander of Humen Fortress, was also appointed as the director of the National Defense Construction Committee Office to handle all official affairs within the committee. Regular meetings are held once a week, convened by the chairman. The committee's address is temporarily located within the First Group Army Headquarters. The budget for the committee's office expenses has been drafted, amounting to approximately 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per month. This funding is allocated from the national defense bond proceeds. Furthermore, considering that Shantou has a very long coastline and is an important port on the East River, where enemy ships frequently appear, the committee previously sent National Defense Committee members Li Jiechi, Zhang Guoyuan, Zhou Zhi, and several military specialists to inspect coastal fortresses in the Chao-Shan area to consolidate the maritime frontier. Recently, as the authorities have moved Li Yangjing's Third Army to the border of Jiangxi to suppress bandits, the Chao-Shan area has been taken over by Zhang Ruigui's Independent Second Division. Fearing that the troop strength would be insufficient, two regiments of Miao Peinan's Training Division were also transferred to Shantou to assist the Independent Second Division in arranging defenses. As for air defense, the Air Force Command was ordered to send aircraft to Sichuan for stationing at the discretion of the province to show thoroughness. (Third day)</p>
<p>Twenty-Second Year</p>
<h3 id="e86">New Budget Proposal for Hunan Province <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>=Political Expenses Six Months in Arrears=</p>
<p>=Implementing Austerity and Reducing Government Spending=</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Due to the impact of the national crisis and rural economic bankruptcy, local revenue in Hunan Province has decreased significantly compared to previous years. The main sources supporting party and government expenses are the land tax, which can collect more than 200,000 yuan per month, and the production and sales tax, which has not yet been approved by the central government but can collect more than 300,000 yuan per month. For the past year, the provincial treasury has allocated political expenses once every ten days, with each allocation only being 10% of the amount owed. Therefore, as of the end of May, political expenses were six months in arrears, demonstrating the financial difficulties. The provincial government has decided to implement austerity and reduce government spending in the next year (i.e., the twenty-second year). Salaries will be discounted as follows: 90% for those with monthly salaries of 21 to 50 yuan, 85% for those with 51 to 100 yuan, 80% for those with 101 to 150 yuan, 75% for those with 151 to 200 yuan, 70% for those with 201 to 300 yuan, 60% for those with 301 to 400 yuan, and 50% for those with over 400 yuan. In addition to salaries, all expenses of various institutions will be reduced by 30%. It is estimated that the annual reduction will be approximately 3 to 4 million yuan. Based on this standard, the new local budget proposal for Hunan Province for the twenty-second year has been prepared. Both revenue and expenditure are 15,771,246 yuan, balancing income and expenses. The outline is recorded as follows: (1) Estimated amount of recurring revenue: Land tax 2,853,768 yuan, deed tax 450,000 yuan, business tax 750,000 yuan, house tax 206,593 yuan, boat tax 50,000 yuan, local property income 64,774 yuan, local business income 96,172 yuan, local administrative revenue 881,345 yuan, local business profit income 1,298,411 yuan, other income (including production and sales tax) 6,219,583 yuan, totaling 12,071,246 yuan. (2) Estimated amount of temporary revenue: Other income (including rice inspection fees, etc.) 1,200,000 yuan, bond income 2,500,000 yuan, totaling 3,700,000 yuan. The total recurring and temporary revenue is 15,771,246 yuan. (3) Estimated amount of recurring expenditure: Party affairs expenses 532,244 yuan, administrative expenses 1,830,583 yuan, judicial expenses 1,080,466 yuan, public security expenses 1,103,648 yuan, financial expenses 1,758,456 yuan, education and culture expenses 2,339,160 yuan, industrial expenses 348,536 yuan, transportation expenses 255,392 yuan, health expenses 153,112 yuan, construction expenses 180,594 yuan, assistance expenses 333,248 yuan, other expenses 801,490 yuan, reserve fund 46,990 yuan, totaling 11,576,527 yuan.

<h3 id="e87">Dividing Routes to Encircle and Suppress the Red Bandits <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Meeting of Generals Held on the Train to Allocate Tasks</p>
<p>He Chengjun Immediately Departs to Inspect the Bandit Situation in Eastern Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, after his public affairs in Hankou, boarded a special train on the Ping-Han Railway at 10 PM on the 8th to go north and transfer to Hanchuan to supervise the suppression. Liang Guanying, Commander-in-Chief of the 25th Route Army, Dai Minquan, Commander of the 45th Division, and Song Tiancai, Commander of the 75th Division, returned to their defense areas on the same train. Liu's bandit suppression plan has already been decided in Hankou, divided into three phases, each lasting one month, with a deadline of three months for complete eradication. The encirclement routes are divided into several routes, undertaken by ten divisions. Roughly, Liu Maoen and Li Sisuan will depart from Huangchuan Guangshan, Shangguan Yunxiang and Hao Mengling will depart from Yingshan Luotian, Wan Yaohuang will depart from Macheng Huang'an, and Dai Minquan's division will depart from Gushi Shangcheng, forming a large encirclement towards the bandits. Liu convened a meeting of various generals on the train to allocate tasks and provide instructions. Upon arrival in Huangchuan, he will issue a general attack order. He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, fearing that after Liu's general suppression, the bandits would flee into Hubei, decided to depart for eastern Hubei within days to inspect, arrange defenses, and provide guidance on local rehabilitation matters. After returning to Hankou from the eastern Hubei inspection, he will tour central Hubei. (Eighth day) Hankou Correspondence: The Xu, Kuang, He, and Kong factions of Red Bandits, taking advantage of the national army's movements, have separately harassed the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, running amok like wild boars, seemingly poised to make a comeback. Currently, He's bandits are confined to a corner, and Kong's bandits are moving around to avoid confrontation, which is not too worrying. However, the Xu and Kuang factions are extremely active, attacking cities and seizing land, just like in the old days. The national army is currently deploying various routes for general suppression, and intense battles are expected to occur in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the recent situation of the Red Bandits and the lineup of the bandit suppression army are explored and recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Recent Trends of Various Red Bandit Factions <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The areas recently harassed by the various Red Bandit factions are the border regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. Xu Xiangqian's faction occupies northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, Kuang Jixun's faction occupies eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui, He Long's faction occupies western Hubei, and Kong Hechong's faction and a part of Peng Dehuai's faction occupy southern Hubei, eastern Hunan, and western Jiangxi. Among them, the Xu and Kuang factions have the greatest strength. Xu's bandits returned from southern Shaanxi at the end of last month and captured Nanjiang on the 30th. Now, they are taking advantage of the victory to attack Bazhong, and the city of Ba is in imminent danger. This faction has a population of 30,000 to 40,000, with no fewer than 20,000 guns, organized into the false Fourth, Ninth, and Twenty-sixth Armies. The bandit leaders include Zhang Guoxuan, He Wei, and Ren Weizhang. Xu serves as the commander-in-chief. The bandits' plan is to penetrate deep into Sichuan and open up a new base area. Those in southern Shaanxi plan to sneak into northern Hubei and take the opportunity to contact the Kuang and He bandits. If they fail, they will all enter Sichuan. Kuang's bandits have the false Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, and Twenty-eighth Armies. Kuang serves as the commander-in-chief, with Liao Rongkun, Shen Zemin, and Lv Huanxian serving as army commanders. Their strength is similar to Xu's faction. Kuang himself is now in southern Henan, and his followers are scattered in various counties in eastern Hubei, western Anhui, Shangcheng, Li'an, Huanggang, and Macheng. The so-called Kang district, Sanhekou, Shunheji, Hejiafan, Wenshusi, Xiangdian, Xianglushan, Longwangshan, Guojiahe, Dafengling, Fotashan, Dafoshan, Xiaofoshan, Denglongshan, Dongyizhou, Futianhe, Zhongguan Station, Yanjiahe, Songziguan, Changgangling, Qiting, Songbu, and various places in Qishan are all places where these bandits gather. Recently, Fuxian (i.e., Xinji) suddenly reported its fall, and the main force of the bandits is gathering there. It is said that they will launch a major attack on Qiliping, which was also an important bandit den in the past, where many guns must be hidden. The bandits' attention to this place is worrying. He's bandits number about 10,000, organized into seven or nine divisions. He himself is the commander-in-chief, with Wang Bingnan and others serving as division commanders. They are still in the Wufeng and Hefeng areas of western Hubei, unable to do anything due to lack of food and ammunition. Kong's bandits have the false Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Armies, numbering about 10,000, with thousands of guns. The commander-in-chief is Kong himself, with Xie Weiye, Jin Bo, and others serving as division commanders, wandering in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Recently, they have reportedly joined forces with the false Nineteenth Army of Peng Dehuai's faction. Although they occasionally harass Xianning, Tongshan, and Yangxin counties in southern Hubei, their main force seems to be in Jiangxi. In total, the number of bandits in each faction is close to 100,000, harassing about twenty counties (in the border region). Their disturbance plans are: (1) to restore the original bandit areas, (2) to open up new bandit areas, (3) to preserve the existing bandit areas, and (4) for each faction to take contact. If they unfortunately get their wish, the consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Deployment of Bandit Suppression Troops <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The bandit suppression troops in various provinces, except for Tian Songyao's troops in northern Sichuan, who cannot fully resist the Xu bandits due to their participation in internal strife, are all fully deployed and will begin general suppression immediately. In eastern Hubei and southern Henan, the person in charge is Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, who took office in Hankou on the 5th. The troops under his command include Chen Jicheng's First Army, Wei Lihuang's Fourteenth Army, Liu Maoen's Fifteenth Army, Wan Yaohuang's Thirteenth Division, Peng Zhenshan's Thirtieth Division, Zhang Yinxiang's Thirty-first Division, Liang Guanying's Thirty-second Division, Dai Minquan's Forty-fifth Division, Shangguan Yunxiang's Forty-seventh Division, Hao Mengling's Fifty-fourth Division, Song Tiancai's Seventy-fifth Division, Li Sisuan's Eightieth Division, and Tang Enbo's Eighty-ninth Division, totaling more than 100,000 troops, stationed in Shangcheng, Gushi, Guangshan, Luoshan, Xinyang, Hanchuan, Huang'an, Macheng, Yingshan, and Luotian counties, forming a large encirclement towards the bandits. The General Headquarters is located in Huangchuan, where Liu is stationed. Chen Jicheng and Wei Lihuang are stationed in Huangchuan and Hekou, respectively, supervising the suppression. Liu gathered Wei Lihuang, Shangguan Yunxiang, Liang Guanying, Song Tiancai, Dai Minquan, and other generals in Hankou, and a border region bandit suppression meeting was scheduled to be held on the 6th. That morning, Liu went to the headquarters to visit Chief of Staff Cao Haosen to discuss military salaries. At noon, he accompanied Wei and Shangguan to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to visit Director He Chengjun for a confidential two-hour discussion on the final preparations for bandit suppression. He then convened various generals to give instructions, ordering them to return to their defenses within days. The border region bandit suppression meeting was therefore canceled. Liu decided to go to Huangchuan on the 8th or 9th to preside over everything. In western Hubei, Xu Yuanquan is in charge of the suppression, with the entire 48th Division, Zhang Wanxin's part of the 34th Division, Zhang Gang's security team, Jiang Zuojun's New Third Brigade, and a part of Liu Jianxu's Hunan army also deployed separately, advancing towards the Shihe bandit den. Xu departed from Shashi on the 6th to inspect Yichang and then transferred to the front to command. In southern Hubei and eastern Hunan, He Jian is in charge of the suppression, and in addition to the remaining Fourth Route Army, the divisions of Guo Rudong and Feng Yuxian stationed in southern Hubei are also under his command. The two divisions of the Fourth Route Army, Tao Guang and Wang Dongyuan, have now entered Jiangxi, and the air squadron has also departed for reconnaissance. Guo's division, Feng's division, and the divisions of Xie Bin and Rong Jingfang are stationed in Daye, Yangxin, Chongyang, Tongshan, and Xianning in Hubei. He Jian himself will be stationed in Pingxiang within days. The total number of national army troops is no fewer than twenty divisions, and all are elite. Once they join forces to encircle and suppress, their advance will be unstoppable. Although the bandits are cunning, they will have no way to survive.</p>

<p>Stipulating Personnel Numbers and Expenses and Recruiting Soldiers from the People</p>
<p>Establishing Joint Defense Command Headquartered Led by Military Agencies</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently been actively organizing militia to establish local military force. All former militia, since January of this year, have had the counties establish Guard Corps Compilation Offices to engage in training. The Compilation Office is headed by a positive and vice director, the county magistrate simultaneously with the positive director, the vice director from the Pacification Office dispatched a military commissioner to serve as. Recently, in the bandit suppression period, the defense army is transferred in an irregular way, and the local self-defense force should be actively rectified in order to achieve the purpose of people's self-defense, and the county chief's government affairs are numerous and complicated, and I am afraid that the police force will not be able to concentrate on compiling and training, so the military authorities, in order to make the guard corps reach the army, have decided that every three or two counties will set up a police team joint defense headquarters, which is set up to command the military training and bandit suppression and maintain public security. The Joint Defense Headquarters will be established after the Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest Pacification Commissioners' Offices are abolished. As for the Eastern District, due to special circumstances, the Chao'an, Jieyang, and Puning Counties Joint Defense Headquarters were established first, and a certain person was appointed by the First Group Army Headquarters to serve as the Joint Defense Commander of the three counties. As for the plan to reorganize the provincial guard corps, the provincial government has also formulated it in recent days, including: (1) Drafting a phased compilation and implementation plan, estimating 5 million qualified strong men in the province, divided into 300 regular companies and 500 reserve companies, the number of companies temporarily averaged (2) The guard corps funds are provided by the provincial treasury, temporarily setting the regular team funds at 6 million yuan per year, the reserve team funds at 1 million yuan per year, and the county compilation office funds at 700,000 yuan per year, and collecting grain tax subjects from the people, and stopping all harsh taxes and middle-class malpractices, (3) Determine the highest command organ of the guard corps, such as Liu Gui directly under the provincial government, subordinate to the headquarters command, and use temporary command names to command, (According to the above, the First Group Army Headquarters has set up a county joint defense headquarters, and has appointed the Chaojie Pu three-county joint defense commander, then the county guard corps will be directly under the headquarters, which seems to have been determined,) (4) Implement a compulsory regular system, completely reform the previous recruitment methods, and recruit soldiers from the people uniformly, (5) Compile and train reserve teams in stages, organize reserve teams at the same time when organizing regular teams, set a time for rotation training, (6) Train cadres and talents, set up cadre training institutes and guard talent training institutions, (7) Strictly clarify rewards and punishments, all regular and reserve teams that have been handled effectively, or those who have not received training, or those who have not been recruited, should be rewarded and punished to encourage them. This plan will be implemented after being submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for approval. (Second day)</p>

<p>Today (9th) morning, the Shanghai-Hangzhou train was driving about ten miles east of Xinzhuang, when a naked man with shackles jumped off the train and was seriously injured. Soon after, another person jumped down in pursuit, breaking the back of his head. When seen by the train guard, he immediately ordered the train to stop and carried the two injured men onto the train and drove to Hangzhou for medical treatment. At that time, villagers gathered to watch. According to people in the car, the man with shackles was a gun thief from a certain agency in Zhejiang who fled to Haimen and bought it from bandits. He was captured by the Haimen authorities and consulted with Zhejiang to send personnel to Haimen to pick him up. He took a wheel to Shanghai and transferred to Hangzhou. The prisoner pretended to urinate in the car, took advantage of the guard's lack of preparation, and jumped off the car to escape in fear of guilt. The guard was anxious and did not care about the pros and cons, and jumped off the car to chase and arrest him, causing them both to be seriously injured. The names cannot be found.</p>

<p>The cocoon shops in the four townships of this county have been weighing for eight days, and the receipt of goods is also sparse. As of yesterday, the early cocoon shops have stopped weighing one after another, about more than 100, and there are still a few cocoon shops, because they are preparing to receive late fresh cocoons, and will extend the weighing to a week later. The purchase results of this silk factory are very good, especially because the cocoon body is good, which is very different from the past, and the reeling is very short. It is expected that the future profits will be optimistic, and the silk market is active, so the general silk merchants are happy, and are preparing to start the car one after another. Compared with the heyday of 49 silk factories, it can start about 70% of the work, but the problem of recruiting female workers is panic, because the former female workers have sought a livelihood with the silk industry's depression, and now the factory wants to recruit a large number of female workers at one time, which is not easy, and the wages are low and thin, each worker is only four corners for the high ones, and the low ones are triangular two corners, the general female workers, regardless of the joy, so the factories are also quite anxious about this, and are now trying to solve it.</p>

<p>The Public Safety Bureau's affairs occupy an essential position in the news carried by local newspapers. Previous Public Safety Bureau chiefs all facilitated news reporters' interviews. Since Wu Dexin took office as the bureau chief, he had also followed established practices. However, recently, after the newly appointed Chief of the First Section of the Public Safety Bureau, Ji Nianru, arrived, he advised Director Wu that all public security matters, whether related to opium, gambling, prostitution, or theft, must be handled secretly. Any leakage must be avoided to prevent being hampered. Therefore, a news blockade policy was implemented. Yesterday afternoon, when reporters went to the Public Safety Bureau to gather news, Ji Nianru said that henceforth, news reporters would not be allowed into the Public Safety Bureau. The reporters believe that even if the Public Safety Bureau has unavoidable difficulties, it can clearly announce them. Why did this sudden decision come about? This is truly a cause for concern regarding the Public Safety Bureau's future. Subsequently, realizing that reasoning with Ji was futile, they all left and reported the matter to the Newspaper Reporters Association, requesting a general membership meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>

Consequently, detectives are dispatched everywhere to search overnight. In addition to capturing three bandits, including Lü Hengshan, who were carrying the latest-style handguns at the train station on the afternoon of the 7th, yesterday, detectives Zhang Qingan and others from the same team captured two major bandits, Liu Dongshan and Hu Baoyu, in the reed marshes of Shierxu.

<p>Previously, the Shaoxing money exchange businesses found it difficult to bear the increase in business tax to 10 per mille. Furthermore, the tax rate in Shanghai was only 2 per mille, a difference of 8 per mille. They had repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce the tax rate accordingly, but their request had not been approved. An explanation was given that Shanghai was a place where Chinese and foreigners lived together, thus deserving a tax reduction. The Shaoxing money exchange businesses felt dissatisfied with the unequal tax treatment for the same type of business. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting it to forward their request to the Ministry of Finance for a tax reduction to alleviate their financial difficulties.</p>

<p>The provincial capital's military police inspection team, while inspecting hotels in the new market last night, went to Room 103 of the Xihu Yingzhou Hotel. There, they found a man in military uniform lodging with a woman. When questioned, they gave evasive answers. The team leader, Director Wu, interrogated them and learned that the man's name was Xu Rongsheng and that he was a "Wu Chai" brother from Tiandeng Village in Xixiang, Shengxian. The woman, Chen Zhangshi, was the wife of a friend whom he claimed he was escorting to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, Chen Jincai, claiming to be Chen Zhangshi's husband, came to the team inquiring about her. Director Wu detained him. Chen confessed that he was the deputy leader of Tiandeng Village and that because they had repeatedly kidnapped and extorted ransoms in Shengxian, they had opened fire on the patrol team once on the 3rd of this month, wounding officers. He also said that they had come to Hangzhou as a gang, intending to carry out two kidnapping operations near West Lake. He also revealed that their Hangzhou base was located at No. 19 Erqiao, Menfu. Director Wu immediately led Deputy Team Leader He Jiachong to the address, where they captured three more bandits, Hua Ayan, Hua Youcai, and Zhang Jindi, as well as the house owner, Yu Apeng. All were detained and a pistol with twenty rounds of ammunition was seized. All confessed to repeatedly committing kidnapping offenses. Documents will be prepared and transferred to the martial law headquarters for interrogation.</p>

We stayed in the Soviet Union for a relatively long time and only stopped in Germany for a week before going to Italy. We departed from Zyata on May 1st. Due to slow travel along the way, the sea voyage took about forty days before we arrived here today. Looking back on our time in Europe, we were treated favorably by various sectors of the local communities. The troops I led, except for a portion that went to the border of Chahar, have all arrived in Xinjiang. All matters regarding the anti-Japanese war and my future actions will be subject to the orders of the Central Government and Chairman Ma. I have no personal opinions to express. After arriving in Shanghai, I will not go to Nanjing for the time being.

<p>New Coins Were Submitted to Various Assay Agencies for Examination</p>
<p>After the Central Mint began minting new coins, Chief Technician Grand arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and immediately went to the mint to inspect the minting machinery.

Details are as follows:</p>

<p>The Central Mint hired Mr. Grand, an American minting expert, as its chief technician. He arrived on the Dalai at 8:30 AM yesterday and landed at the Xin Guan Wharf. Vice Director Wei Jingzhou of the Mint and representatives from foreign banks went to the wharf to welcome him. At 10:00 AM, he went to the Xiaoshadu Mint, where he was accompanied by Vice Director Wei Jingzhou to inspect the minting machinery. At 1:00 PM, he visited Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the Auditing Committee.</p>

<p>In accordance with the regulations for minting silver standard currency, the Central Mint is increasing its daily output of new coins to over 200,000 yuan. The minted coins are temporarily stored in the vault. After the Auditing Committee sends assayers to verify that the coins meet the legal standards for fineness and weight, they can be circulated on the market. In addition, mint bars will be produced, each bar containing 1,000 silver coins, with a fineness of .999 pure and a gross weight of 739.0774 ounces. The bars are rectangular in shape, with the Chinese and English characters for "Central Mint One Thousand Yuan Bar" on the front, along with the fineness and weight.</p>

<p>The Auditing Committee held its second meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday at the Central Bank on the Bund. The committee members present included Kong Xiangxi, Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Li Fuson, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jigu, Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Xie Taofu, Qin Runqing, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Hu Junzhuang, Jian Dongpu, Hao Shumin, Lei Shengbo, Ma Su, Lin Shu, Ma Xier, David, Reese, Minar, Spiman, Geng Aide, Mackay, Shi Huang, Stedman, and Dai Jingfu.

<p>Chairman Kong Xiangxi reported on the purpose of the meeting and welcomed Grand, the chief technician of the mint, to report on the state of the U.S. Mint. Grand then gave a report, which was translated as follows: In the U.S. Mint, the minted coins are submitted to the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance for assay. A fee of one yuan is charged for every 5,000 yuan submitted for assay. After the coins are certified as qualified, they are issued for circulation. The fineness is very good. On one occasion, during an assay, a coin was found to be below the required fineness. Fortunately, it had not been issued and was reminted. Now, China stipulates that the tolerance for the weight and fineness of each silver standard coin compared to the legal weight and fineness must not exceed three per mille. This is even stricter than in the U.S. Mint. If we work hard and find ways to do things, we will surely achieve our goal. If you want to study the situation of the U.S. Mint, I am happy to answer your questions at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Resolutions <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After the discussion began: (1) The working hours of the Auditing Committee were resolved to be eight hours per day. (2) In accordance with the Auditing Regulations, one secretary will be appointed. It was resolved that this position would be temporarily filled by the Secretariat of the Central Bank. (3) One assayer will be appointed to handle assaying affairs. It was resolved that, before the appointee arrives, the newly minted coins would be submitted to various assay agencies in Shanghai and other cities for examination by the Standing Committee. (4) The draft rules of procedure were resolved to be amended and approved. (5) Matters concerning the assessment of mint operations and the auditing of accounts were resolved to be decided at the next general meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

When the refugees passed through Nanjing Road, Chinese and foreign pedestrians stopped to watch and sighed incessantly.</p>

<p>After arriving at the Xin Xin Ballroom, the refugees took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. The Refugee Relief Association bought a large number of steamed buns and distributed them to the refugees to satisfy their hunger. The Global Chinese Association not only provided lunch at the Xin Xin Restaurant but also gave each person a temporary relief payment of ten yuan. Because the refugees had been expelled in a hurry, they had nothing with them except the clothes on their backs. In addition, they were physically and mentally exhausted from the long journey and were in a wretched condition.</p>

<p>Most of the refugees who came to Shanghai this time were from Guangdong, Nanhai, Zhongshan, Taishan, and other counties. Because they had been away from their hometowns for a long time, they were eager to return home. Therefore, they did not delay their stay in Shanghai. They boarded the original ship last night to go to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong to return to their native places. The ship departed from Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning.</p>

<p>According to Liu Sen, a refugee who came to Shanghai, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico is getting worse every day. The cruelty of the situation is not only rare in China and abroad but also unprecedented in ancient and modern times. In particular, the anti-Chinese activities in the two provinces of Shunshan are the most severe in terms of insulting overseas Chinese. The party has a great influence and arbitrarily drives cars to capture overseas Chinese every day, driving them to remote mountains and cliffs and leaving them to die. In addition to privately torturing overseas Chinese, they also prevent Chinese businesses from operating and confiscate their property, which is inhumane. Although the central government of that country has ordered the authorities of the two provinces to stop this action, the provinces are autonomous and the order has no effect. Therefore, although the Chinese government has sent a protest note, it has no effect whatsoever. He expressed his indignation and hoped that the Chinese government would vigorously negotiate with the Mexican government to maintain China's prestige and protect the lives of overseas Chinese.</p>

The presidium of the second Mexican Refugee Congress in Shanghai, Huang Zhulin, Zhen Xin, and Huang Zhaojun, respectfully.</p>

<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the newly appointed U.S. Governor-General of the Philippines, Murphy, arrived in Shanghai this morning (9th) aboard the President Coolidge to take office in Manila. Chinese and American officials and representatives of the American community in Shanghai boarded the ship to welcome him and accompanied him ashore, where they took up residence at the Cathay Hotel. Accompanying him were the Teihan couple. Mrs. Teihan is the Governor-General's sister. Because Mr. Murphy, although 40 years old, is still unmarried, she will go to the Philippines to act as his hostess. Also traveling with him are economic advisor Mills and his wife, legal advisor Kemper, secretary Hill, and Major General Knox, the newly appointed Director of the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs. He first wanted to inspect the situation in the Philippines and study important issues before going to Washington to take office. He also traveled to the Philippines from Honolulu on the same ship. They will all leave Shanghai on the original ship at midnight tonight. Mayor Wu of Shanghai held a reception at his private residence on Haige Road in the evening to welcome the Governor-General. He served tea and refreshments. U.S. Consul General Cunningham held a dinner party at his residence in the evening to welcome Murphy. The American Chamber of Commerce held a reception at the Columbia Country Club at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Xu Jianping held a luncheon because he and Murphy were classmates at the University of Michigan. He also invited members of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the University of Michigan and directors of the Pacific Association to reminisce about the past.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Successful Trial Flight on the Entire Eurasia Route <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The New Aircraft Will Arrive at 10:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>The Company Is Preparing a Grand Welcome</p>
<p>One of the Aircraft Will Remain in Lanzhou Temporarily</p>
<p>In order to achieve full operation of the entire Eurasia route, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation ordered several aircraft from Germany. Two of the Junkers aircraft have been purchased, and pilots Bolt and Lutz were assigned to pilot them for a trial flight on the entire Eurasia route. The aircraft took off from Berlin on May 31st, arrived in Moscow on the 2nd, in Dihua on the 5th, and in Lanzhou on the 8th. One of the two aircraft will not return to Shanghai immediately because it will be used to fly Huang Musong, the Xinjiang Envoy, to Dihua. The other aircraft took off from Lanzhou yesterday and is scheduled to land at the Hongqiao Airport at 10:00 AM this morning. Li Jingzong, General Manager of the company, believes that this flight represents the success of the trial flight on the entire Eurasia route and has expressed a grand welcome to the pilots. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Report from the Ministry of Communications <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Ministry of Communications in Nanjing: The two aircraft that the company ordered from Germany have returned on May [illegible date]. One will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, indicating the success of the Eurasia trial flight. The other will remain in Lanzhou to transport Envoy Huang to Dihua. Respectfully reported, General Manager Li Jingzong.</p>

<p>To the director of the Nanjing Station: The aircraft ordered by the company from Germany will fly to Nanjing today. Upon arrival, please notify Director Wei of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications as soon as possible. Jingzong.</p>
<p>(Invitation to Visit)</p>
<p>In addition to leading company employees to the airport at 9:00 AM this morning to welcome the aircraft, Li Jingzong, General Manager of the company, also sent letters to leaders in the transportation industry, inviting them to send representatives to the airport to inspect the cotton and wheat loan agreement reached between China and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Expression from the City Farmers' Association <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting Maintenance of Wheat Prices</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance negotiated a 50 million dollar cotton and wheat loan with the United States, all sectors of this city have been paying close attention. The City Farmers' Association, due to the recent arrival of new wheat on the market and the resulting low prices which have greatly affected the lives of farmers, yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to find ways to maintain prices. The original telegram is recorded below: To Chen Jun, Minister of Industry in Nanjing: We are deeply concerned about the current sharp drop in market prices of agricultural products, which is causing immense hardship for farmers. Recently, we learned that the Ministry of Finance is borrowing 50 million US dollars to purchase American cotton and wheat, and after reading this, we cannot help but be alarmed. We feel compelled to speak out to Your Excellency. Our country's agricultural products mainly consist of cotton, rice, beans, and wheat. In recent years, prices have been declining, and the situation is now even worse. Currently, the market price of wheat is only 1.9 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and barley is even less. In this time of social and economic depression, low prices are beneficial to the livelihood of the people, but the wages, fertilizers, and daily necessities required by farmers for planting have not only not decreased, but have increased daily. Now, the price of their produce is being devalued, which is unfair. Farmers cannot even recover their costs. If foreign wheat is dumped on the market, it is inevitable that the price of domestic wheat will continue to fall. The government's intention to benefit the farmers will actually harm them. We believe that this has not been carefully considered. The Association witnesses this situation and cannot remain silent. We dare to speak out, hoping that the Ministry will take effective measures to maintain the price of domestic wheat after purchasing American wheat, so as to increase the reward for farmers' hard work and rescue them from their precarious situation. This will also benefit the social economy and the lifeline of the nation. We are deeply concerned and await your instructions. Respectfully, the Shanghai City Farmers' Association.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Inspection of Enemy Goods in Two Industries <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(Southern Goods) The Enemy Goods Inspection Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday afternoon at 2 pm to discuss active measures to eliminate enemy goods. More than twenty people attended including Lu Wenji, Huang Benli, Xu Baoqi, Huang Jiabang, and Ni Baofu. Chairman Gong Jingyan reported on the registration of various stores and the reporting of unscrupulous merchants. Then, the following resolutions were passed: (1) All stores in the city must submit their registration forms to the committee within three days. (2) On the 11th of this month, the American Settlement will be the first area to be investigated separately. (3) Comrades Yao Fenglin and Huang Jiabang were assigned to inspect a certain store on Kang Nao Road for secretly importing large quantities of enemy goods. (4) Omitted. (5) Inspectors must wear badges when working. (6) District meetings will be held to discuss the elimination of enemy goods within a specified period. The meeting adjourned after the discussions. (Silk Weaving Industry) The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association was extremely alarmed by the report in the newspaper the day before yesterday about the Nanjing telegram stating that Japanese silk was being transported to Shanghai with reduced tariffs, and that famous silk factories and fabric factories were placing orders one after another. Since this matter concerns the reputation of the entire industry and will undermine the future of domestic goods, an emergency meeting was immediately convened. It was unanimously agreed that China is a silk-producing country, and customs reports have never shown any imports of Japanese silk. Moreover, in recent years, the Chinese silk industry has been declining, and silk prices have fallen sharply, even below cost. Currently, the domestic raw silk used by Shanghai's silk factories costs an average of no more than 750 yuan per dan, while Japanese raw silk, according to yesterday's Reuters telegram, costs 980 Japanese yen per dan. Based on this situation, it is not cost-effective to transport Japanese silk to China with reduced tariffs. However, it is possible that Japanese silk merchants are intentionally dumping goods at low prices, and unscrupulous merchants are disregarding morality and secretly adopting them. Yesterday, the association believed that this matter has a great impact on China's silk industry. It is imperative to investigate the truth. Yesterday, it has already submitted a request to the Customs Superintendent and the Tax Affairs Department and sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, asking them to thoroughly investigate the matter to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The Reorganization of Sichuan's Administration Should Be Implemented According to Principles</p>
<p>The Import of Military Supplies Has Long Been Explicitly Prohibited</p>
<p>The General Association for the Abolition of Civil War Alliance, in order to fundamentally resolve the Sichuan war, telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission in winter, requesting the rapid implementation of the predetermined principles and methods of the Executive Yuan for reorganizing Sichuan Province, and prohibiting the import of military supplies into Sichuan Province. After the telegram was sent, the Military Affairs Commission replied yesterday as follows: To the General Association for the Abolition of Civil War Alliance on Dege Port Road, Shanghai: Your winter telegram regarding the methods for reorganizing Sichuan's military and political affairs has been approved. Please implement them promptly according to the predetermined principles, and strictly enforce the ban so that no military supplies may be transported into Sichuan Province in the future, in order to stem the source of chaos and alleviate Sichuan's suffering. The methods for reorganizing Sichuan's military and political affairs should be implemented according to the predetermined principles. As for the import of military supplies, it has long been explicitly prohibited. This is a special telegram in reply for your information. Respectfully, Military Affairs Commission, Yu Zhan Seal.</p>

<p>The Central Government Will Adopt the Opinions of the Southwest as Much as Possible</p>
<p>If Ordered to Go to Guangdong, I Dare Not Refuse</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Li Liejun of the Central Committee, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Mi Gong, arrived in Shanghai by express train at 4:50 PM yesterday afternoon after departing at 10:00 AM. He immediately returned to his residence to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li at his residence last night to inquire about the current situation in Chahar and other issues. According to Mr. Li, he only knows about the current situation in Chahar from news reports and has no special information. As far as he knows, Mr. Feng Huanzhang's actions are entirely directed towards foreign aggression and not internal conflicts. In order to seek national unity and avoid internal divisions within the party, the Central Government has decided to postpone the convocation of the Provisional National Congress and hold the Fifth National Congress on November 12th. Although this move may seem to break faith with the people, it is by no means the responsibility of the Central Government. The Central Government has adopted the principle of "turning major issues into minor issues and minor issues into no issues" in order to seek national spiritual unity and unanimously resist foreign aggression. The Central Government has adopted the opinions of the Southwest as much as possible, and the spiritual cooperation between the Central Government and the Southwest will soon become a reality. The Central Government previously discussed sending representatives to Guangdong to explain misunderstandings, but no formal decision has been made. Several people may be sent to Guangdong within a few days, but the number and selection of personnel have not yet been determined. Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen have already gone to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and will stay in Lushan for a short period of time for recuperation. Mr. Li himself has recently been suffering from high blood pressure and also plans to go to Kuling for a short period of time for recuperation. The reporter then asked Mr. Li whether the rumors that he would be going to Guangdong on behalf of the Central Government were true. Mr. Li replied that if the Central Government ordered him to do so, he would certainly not refuse.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ma and Su's Arrival in Shanghai Undetermined <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Welcome Meetings of Various Groups Postponed</p>
<p>Various groups in this city previously planned to hold a grand welcome for the anti-Japanese heroes Ma and Su upon their return to China and telegraphed Ma and Su to come to Shanghai. Ma and Su replied to the various groups from Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the City Chamber of Commerce and all groups: We have received your telegram with respect. Zhanshan and others have returned to the country with guilt and deeply feel indebted. We are grateful for your previous welcome and even more grateful for your telegram invitation. However, our mission is not yet completed, and we must stay for a few more days. We plan to come to Shanghai when we have time to express our gratitude in person. Respectfully, Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen." It is now heard that the welcome meetings of various groups, originally scheduled to be held on the 11th, will also be postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e137">British New Warship Launched Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Mougen Throws the Bottle</p>
<p>The shallow-water gunboat commissioned by the British Navy to be built at the Jiangnan Shipyard, known as the (Sandoiker) in Western languages, has been largely completed and held a launching ceremony at 1:00 PM yesterday. Mrs. Mougen, the chief engineer of the shipyard, threw the bottle to name the ship. More than a hundred people attended, including the British Consul-General and his wife, and important figures from the British Navy stationed in Shanghai, making it a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Arrangement of the Ceremony Platform) The ceremony platform was located at the West Fort, with the ship surrounded by international naval signal flags. The British flag and the Chinese flag with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth were hung high on both sides. A bottle of champagne wrapped in a five-color silk ribbon was tied to the bow of the ship. Soldiers from the Naval Guard Battalion maintained order and security below the platform.</p>
<p>(Launching Order) Yesterday's launching ceremony followed the British format completely: (1) Singing hymns, (2) Playing music (by the famous Lancashire Army Band stationed in Shanghai), (3) Prayer, (4) Blessing, (5) Singing the British national anthem, (6) Naming ceremony, (7) Bottle throwing and launching, (8) Tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>(Chinese and Western Guests) Yesterday, guests who participated, in addition to going directly to Gaochang Temple by car, mostly took the Jiangnan small steamer provided by the shipyard from the Customs Wharf at 12:30 PM. They included the British Consul-General in Shanghai (Mr. Jaurodfn) and his wife, the chief engineer of the shipyard, Mr. Mougen and his wife, the customs inspector and the ship's supervisor (Mr. Holk Road), dozens of naval officers, the entire Lancashire Army Band, and two pastors. From the Chinese Navy, those who attended included the Deputy Director of the shipyard, Chen Zaofan (Director Chen Shaokuan was in Beijing), Lin Yuanquan, captain of the Yingrui warship, Qiu Zizhong, captain of the Ziqiang warship, Wu Shenli, staff officer of the First Fleet Headquarters, Captain Ouyang of the Hairong warship, Jiang Xihu, Captains Gan and Huang of the Jun warship, and Weng Zuguang of the shipyard's secretarial department, totaling more than a hundred people.</p>
<p>(Grand Bottle-Throwing Scene) At 1:10 PM, the ceremony began with a pastor leading the singing of hymns and prayers, and the Lancashire Army Band playing music. Then, the bottle-throwing ceremony was performed. Mrs. Mougen held a bouquet of flowers in her left hand and a champagne bottle tied with a five-color silk ribbon to the bow of the ship in her right hand. When the bell rang, she aimed the bottle at the bow of the ship and threw it with force. With a loud crash and champagne splattering everywhere, the ship slid into the Huangpu River amidst cheers and applause.</p>
<p>(Reception with Tea and Refreshments) After the bottle-throwing ceremony, Deputy Director Chen of the shipyard led the Chinese and English guests on foot to the shipyard's dining hall for tea and refreshments. However, because the guests were quite crowded, additional seats were temporarily added. Champagne was shared in celebration.</p>
<p>(Director's Speech) During the seating, Deputy Director Chen gave a speech, saying: "Today, the British warship (Sandpiker Holk) is being launched. We are honored by the presence of all of you. This is the first time that our shipyard has built a British gunboat. We still hope to have this type of project again in the future. This ship was designed by the British Navy and built by the British Komin Factory. The factory has a close relationship with our shipyard, and many of its students have interned at our factory. This ship was supervised by (Holk Road) and (Hubg) of the Komin Factory, and they cooperated very well with our shipyard. We hope that this ship will exceed the original speed in the future. I would like to thank the Consul-General and all the officers of the British Navy, and I am especially grateful to Mrs. Mougen for naming and throwing the bottle. Please join me in a toast to wish you all a long life." After Chen's speech, the British naval officer and Mrs. Mougen gave speeches in response, and the guests dispersed, still taking the original steamer to disembark at the Customs Wharf.</p>
<p>(Overall Ship Structure) According to Mr. Weng Zuguang of the shipyard, the ship is 167 feet long, 30 feet wide, 5 feet deep, and has a draft of 2 feet. Its speed is 15 nautical miles per hour. The hull supervisor is Mr. (Nyhalt), and the machinery supervisor is Commander (Road). It is expected to be completed in one month after launching. After launching, it will immediately enter the dock for other construction work.</p>
<p>(Telegram to Beijing) After the ship was launched, Deputy Director Chen of the shipyard telegraphed Minister Chen Shaokuan in Nanjing, stating: "To Minister Chen Shaokuan of the Navy Department in Nanjing: Confidential. The British warship (Sandopiker) was successfully launched at 1:00 PM this afternoon (remainder omitted)."</p>
<h3 id="e138">City Party Department Telegraphed Requesting the Punishment of Feng Yuxiang <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The City Executive Committee Telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, stating: "To the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing: We have repeatedly received reports that Feng Yuxiang is taking advantage of the opportunity to seize Chahar and disregard central authority, resisting the Japanese after the ceasefire in North China instead of resisting during the bloody battles on the Great Wall. His intentions are despicable. Although he has telegraphed to resist Japan for more than ten days, he has not sent a single soldier to fight the enemy. He only replaces government officials, extorts money from the local people, establishes his own headquarters, and acts like a monkey in a hat, deceiving himself and others. It is clear that he has betrayed the country. Recently, he has surrendered to the Third International, selling out the nation and colluding with Soviet Russia, employing communists in an attempt to communize North China and incite internal strife to aid foreign enemies. Even Wu Sangui and Shi Jingtang in historical records were not as treacherous. Now, at this critical time when suppressing the communists and saving the nation are of utmost importance, Feng Yuxiang is acting against the tide to such an extreme degree that if he is not severely punished to prevent chaos from spreading, it will become an incurable disease. We request that the committee swiftly launch a punitive expedition to eliminate this threat. We eagerly await your decision. The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee."</p>

<h3 id="e140">Aircraft Engineer Wang Zhuchen Returns from Germany <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhuchen, the younger brother of Dr. Wang Yuanchen, the director of Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tongji University. In 1928, he went to Germany at his own expense, first interning at a Berlin automobile factory, and then entered the Aircraft Engineering Department of Wanma Industrial University. He graduated in 1932 with a degree in aircraft and automobile engineering. After graduation, he interned at aircraft, automobile, and motor factories such as the Czech Wanertou, where he was proficient in the manufacture, repair, and driving of various aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Photo of Mr. Wang Guichen <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Later, through the introduction of the factory, he was hired as an engineer at the Italian Caproni Aircraft Factory. All types of aircraft ordered by China from that country were personally tested by Mr. Wang. This time, Mr. Wang returned to China with his wife. Wanertou and other factories competed to hire him as the general manager in China, but Mr. Wang declined because he believed that selling foreign products would lead to the outflow of profits. Mr. Wang arrived in Shanghai on the Conte Rosso liner a few days ago and went to Beijing to visit his relatives and contact the central government about establishing his own aircraft manufacturing factory. He will go to Hangzhou in two weeks to test the No. 101 bomber newly purchased by the Aviation Administration from Italy.</p>

<p>After the China Aviation Association Fund Management Committee held its first meeting in March and elected seven standing committee members, Xu Yongzuo and two others were added by the Standing Council, totaling nine members. However, the solicitation work in the city was still in progress, so work had not yet begun, and standing committee meetings had not been convened. Now, the fund collection ended at the end of May, and the amounts not yet paid by each team are being urged by the Chief Captain's Office for completion. According to the association's charter, the use and distribution of funds must be decided by the Management Committee. Therefore, the first standing committee meeting was held at 5:00 PM yesterday at the general meeting room at 99 Jisi Feier Road. The attendees included Chairman Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee members Shi Liangcai, Cai Zengji, and Pan Xulun (replaced by Lin Kanghou). Kong Yongzhi, president of the Central Bank, and Lin Wojian, secretary of the association, were present as observers. Mayor Wu Tiecheng was also a standing committee member of the association but was unable to attend due to a conflict in time with a tea party for the new US Governor-General of the Philippines, Mr. Fei Mo. Since the legal quorum was not met, a discussion was held. It was decided that the donations collected, which were scattered among various banks, money shops, and organizations, should be concentrated under the Management Committee and deposited in designated banks and money shops. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>Wei Tingshan, a former Chinese policeman of the French Concession Police Department, impersonated a secret policeman of the police department at 5:30 AM on the 3rd of this month and forcibly extorted money from Qiu Miaogen and Wang Awu, who were squatting to defecate in an open space on Maiqi Road in the French Concession. While they were arguing, they were discovered by three Chinese policemen, numbers 381, 196, and 104, from the Shanzhong Road Police Department, who were on patrol. Wei was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. After interrogation, the facts were confirmed, and a sentence was ordered. Details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo sentenced Wei Tingshan to three months in prison for the crime of fraud. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the judgment, the defendant was transferred to the detention center to await the end of the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>

<p>Lin Xuemei, a Ningbo woman in her early twenties, with a beautiful appearance, worked as a female worker at the Dongyouheng Cigarette Factory. Every day, she had to pass by Huichang on Tangshan Road. Li Yuanhu, a worker from the same factory, saw her. Li, who was 26 years old and still unmarried, often saw Miss Lin, who was petite and exquisite, and could not help but be moved. Two weeks ago, he arbitrarily teased her, intending to seduce her, and often stalked her. The woman initially ignored him, but then responded with harsh words. Li became annoyed and angry and also cursed at her, and they dispersed. At about 6:00 AM on the 1st of this month, Miss Lin was walking on Xinji Bang Road when Li Yuanhu, who had been waiting in the alley beforehand, suddenly rushed out and splashed a bottle of nitric acid on her entire body. The woman screamed in pain and cried for help. People took her to the Tongren Hospital. After a medical examination, it was found that she had suffered minor injuries to her back. She was given medication and then discharged. Li, feeling guilty and fearing arrest, asked a friend to reconcile with the woman. Only then did it become known that Li was hiding at 467 Zhaofeng Road. On the day before yesterday, the Huishan Police Department was informed and ordered detectives to arrest Li. Attorney Zhang Tianyin explained the case and presented the woman's damaged clothing as evidence, requesting investigation. Subsequently, the woman, Lin Xuemei, testified to the facts of the case. The defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Wu sentenced the defendant to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>The apprentice San Nuan in the Gonghechun Noodle Restaurant at 53 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, joked with Han Xiyuan. Han was pushed and fell on the corner of a bench and died immediately. The patrolling police arrested San Nuan and others and sent them to the Fourth Police Station. The local bailiff, Lu Abaobao, was ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Zhang and forensic doctor Zhang, who were commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene. The autopsy revealed that Han Xiyuan's injury was in his back and that he had died from the injury. The family was ordered to collect the body. The apprentice Er Nuan and others testified that they often joked around and that the deceased hit them, so they defended themselves and pushed him, but they did not expect him to fall on the corner of the bench and die. The restaurant owner, Xu Fengqi, claimed to be unaware of the incident. The official ordered the police district to transfer San Nuan and others to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Judgment in the Case of Dai Jikui and His Concubine's Lawsuit <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>=Concubine's Request for Alimony Rejected=</p>
<p>=However, Management of Land and House Contract Valid=</p>
<p>Dai Jikui (also known as Dai Jigao), a resident of Nantong, is already in his fifties. Due to his years of business in Shanghai, his business has flourished, and he has accumulated some wealth. This has been coveted by his estranged concubine, Huang Cuixuan, leading to mutual lawsuits. According to the woman's complaint, in 1914, her former husband passed away. In 1917, she remarried Dai as his wife, and the following year, she gave birth to a daughter, Zhiying. However, after Dai took Hongying as a concubine in 1929, he suddenly turned against her. In the third month of 1929, they signed a separation agreement, stating that Dai would hand over 64.4 mu of sandy farmland in Changshu and a house in Sanxing Town, Washi, to her and her daughter to live in and manage. The rent from the land and house would be used for her annual living expenses. Later, because Dai did not repair the house, she could not live there and continued to reside in Shanghai with her daughter. In addition to paying for her daughter's tuition, Dai gave her 120 yuan per month for alimony. The rental income from the land and house, about 600 yuan per year, was also for her use. In recent years, due to famine, there was no rental income, and Dai stopped paying alimony. Therefore, she sued, requesting the court to order Dai Jikui to pay alimony at the rate of 120 yuan per month from January of this year until she reaches 65 years old in 1946, a one-time payment of 20,160 yuan. She also requested confirmation that the contract signed in March 1929 for the management of land and house is continuously valid. Dai Jikui hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to argue that after Huang's husband died, he took pity on her poverty and lived with her. Since there was no matchmaker or any formal ceremony, she was not a formal spouse, and he was not legally obligated to provide alimony. He had been in the exchange business, which everyone knew. The woman's living situation should be assessed based on his economic affluence. In the past, when the business was profitable, he fulfilled all her requests. Even after the separation, her rent and daily expenses were still paid. Last year, the business failed, and he decided to move back to Nantong. However, the woman was extravagant and addicted to vices. Not only did she refuse to return with him, but on March 21st of this year, she gathered more than a dozen men and women to cause trouble. Afterwards, she falsely accused him of assault. Fortunately, the police station investigated and sternly reprimanded her. Later, while he was back in his hometown, she stole all his rosewood furniture and clothes and fled. As for the land and house in Changshu, when they separated, it was stated in the agreement that she would manage it on his behalf because he needed to do business in Shanghai. It was also noted that when he returned to his hometown, she should return the management rights. Since she has not returned to her hometown, how can she claim it as her own? He requested that the original lawsuit be rejected and filed a counterclaim against the woman, detailing the circumstances of entrusting Huang Cuixuan to manage the purchased land and house. He stated in the counterclaim that the original plaintiff is now returning to Tong with his entire family, and the management rights should be recovered. He requested that the contract be declared invalid. After repeated court sessions presided over by Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District Court, summoning both parties for interrogation, the judgment was announced yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff Dai Huang's request for the defendant to pay a one-time alimony of over 20,000 yuan was entirely rejected. However, the contract for the management of land and house was still considered valid. In addition, the defendant's counterclaim was also rejected.</p>

<p>Case of Plotting to Assassinate Lytton</p>
<h3 id="e151">Three Principal Offenders Identified <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>丨The Assassination of Finance Minister Song Was Also Committed by These Three丨</p>
<p>More Than Twenty-Two People Have Been Detained</p>
<p>Sixteen of Them Were Released Yesterday Morning After Interrogation Proved Their Innocence</p>
<p>Two Were Transferred to the Second Special Court Due to the Case, and One Died of Illness</p>
<p>In October of last year, Chief Inspector You A'gen and Inspector Liu Junqing of the Old Zha Gate Police Station uncovered an organization plotting to assassinate a certain important person of the International Investigation Team. The location was at 90 Mintini Yin Road in the French Concession. They arrested on the spot: Long Lin (also known as Junwu, i.e., Shaoyuan), Ma Yijin (also known as Desheng), Tang Ming (also known as "Blind"), Ma Yinhe, Tian Zemin, Weng Xinwu, Chen Chunting, Li Yuncheng, Zhang Chun, Chen Jiesan, He Yinshan, Wan Jiayun, Liu Hanqing, Qin Tianyou, Xiang Ziyun, Xu Hongyuan, Wang Yunqiao, Su Zhian, Wang Bolin, Yu Minghai, Li Zhongfa, and Feng Guoqi, totaling twenty-two people. They confiscated one hand grenade, one pistol, and nine bullets. After detailed investigation, it was found that when Lord Lytton and his party of the League of Nations Investigation Team came to Shanghai and resided at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road, these individuals, under the command of a certain military faction, also opened room 51 in the hotel, preparing several bombs, intending to throw them when Lord Lytton and the Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun went out. Fortunately, the Chinese military police and the concession authorities deployed tight security, preventing them from succeeding. Nevertheless, it was a close call. Furthermore, the case of the assassination attempt on Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station was also committed by Long Lin and others. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for adjudication and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation. Those defendants found to be innocent would be sent back to facilitate investigation into any criminal behavior in the Public Concession. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after the interrogation of Long Lin and the other twenty-two people by the Local Court, it was determined that Long Lin, Tang Ming, and Wang Yunqiao were the principal offenders in the above two major cases. The others had no evidence of involvement in the crimes. Therefore, charges were filed against Long and the other three according to the law, and the rest were sent back to the Old Zha Gate Police Station. However, one of them, Chen Chunting, died of illness upon being sent back. Further investigation revealed that Ma Yijin and Li Zhongfa had committed multiple theft cases in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian Hongye conducted the trial. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi explained the previous situation, stating briefly that Ma and Li were involved in theft cases in the French Concession. Today, the Second Special Court sent personnel to request their transfer. The police station did not object. The other sixteen people, including Ma Yinhe, Tian Zemin, and Weng Xinwu, were found to have no criminal behavior and should be released. Judge Qian then ordered that Ma Yijin and Li Zhongfa be handed over to the personnel sent by the Second Special Court for further investigation. The remaining sixteen people, including Ma Yinhe, were released together.</p>

<p>The Second Shanghai County Agricultural Exhibition is scheduled to open today.

<p>There is No Summer This Year</p>
<h3 id="e154">Yangtze River Water Level Reaches Thirty-Eight Feet <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Flood Relief Committee in Shanghai Has Received Reports</p>
<p>Whether a Disaster Will Occur Depends on the Weather in July</p>
<p>Since the major flood in Wuhan in 1931, continuous rain has fallen in Han Gao since the beginning of this month, causing the river water to rise sharply, reaching a level of thirty-eight feet. At the same time, according to reports from the observatory, there will be no extreme heat this summer. If the weather continues like this, the disasters of the past may inevitably be repeated today. Concerned about the social livelihood of the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the reporter yesterday specifically visited the National Government Flood Relief Committee on the Bund in Shanghai. According to its engineer, Lu Chao, April, May, and June are originally periods of heavy rainfall. The formation of the major flood in Wuhan in the past was due to heavy rainfall in May and June, followed by storms in July, making it difficult for the river to discharge and causing the river water to overflow, resulting in significant losses. Although they received a report on the 5th of this month stating that the river water had risen to a high of thirty-eight feet, it was not as high as the water level in previous years. Thirty-eight feet is only the same as in 1926. If the weather in July is good, without any wind or rain, the water will definitely recede at that time. Therefore, the water level, flow rate, and climate are all related. The waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers are unlike other rivers; the water comes quickly and recedes quickly. According to their sources, it is all due to the melting snow on the mountains in Sichuan and Chongqing upstream after the rain in May and June, which flows downstream, making it difficult for the rivers to discharge for a time. Therefore, July is the discharge period. If the weather is sunny and mild in that month, there will definitely be no disaster. The height of the water level is unimportant due to the unique riverbed of the Yangtze River. The water levels near Xunhan often differ by as much as four feet. Even in Chongqing, the water level is more than five hundred feet higher than that of Wusong at the downstream end. Yichang and Wusong also differ by about two hundred feet. As for the embankments built by this committee, since the major flood in 1931, the damage along the river has been quite significant. After active repairs by this committee, the embankments in Wuhu, Wuhan, and Jiujiang, etc., will all be completed by the end of this month. The built embankments are all higher and thicker than before, by three to four feet. Therefore, even if the water is as high as in previous years, it will definitely be difficult to overflow the embankments. The lock works are more complicated and will not be completed until the end of September. Therefore, the current state of the river water depends on the weather in July. This committee has branches in Wuhan, including the Jianghan Bureau and the Jianggan Bureau. They have been instructed to pay attention at all times and report accordingly.</p>

<p>丨Statistics from the Health Bureau's Inspection丨</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, for the purpose of maintaining the health of students, is currently jointly working with the Education Bureau to handle school health and health education work. At yesterday's municipal meeting, Health Bureau Director Li reported that, up to recently, a total of 31,050 students had been examined. Those suffering from trachoma accounted for more than 60%, those suffering from dental diseases accounted for more than 53%, those with poor eyesight accounted for more than 22%, those with poor hearing accounted for more than 6%, those suffering from skin diseases accounted for more than 3%, those with lung diseases accounted for more than 2%, and those with heart diseases accounted for more than 1%. Only 14% of the students are physically healthy, meaning that on average, 86 out of every 100 people suffer from illness or have defects. This shows the fragility of our country's citizens' physique, and it is urgently necessary to remedy it. Although measures have been taken to treat them, the effects are difficult to achieve due to limited funding and personnel. It is also heard that the Health and Education Bureaus are actively discussing measures to facilitate the treatment of students and maintain the health of young people, so as not to hinder their ability to study and improve their efficiency in serving the country in the future.</p>

<p>Resulted in the Capture of Two Thieves</p>
<p>A local woman, Qian Jinshi, is 55 years old. Her husband died early. She lives at 1 Hu Jiazhai, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. She has a daughter who has been betrothed and is about to marry. Therefore, Qian specifically prepared a dowry and jewelry for her daughter, which was extremely rich. However, the area is close to the wilderness. A group of neighbors, seeing such a rich dowry, could not help but admire it. The news quickly spread throughout the village and was heard by bandits. Suddenly, at about 7 AM yesterday, while the family had not yet gotten up, three bandits went to rob them. Two bandits were armed with pistols, and one unarmed person stood guard outside the door. They all spoke with a Jiangbei accent. After entering the door, they rushed into Qian's bedroom, forbidding her from making any noise, and searched everywhere. They left after about half an hour. Seeing that there was another room next to Qian's bedroom, they turned back into the room of Xu Shenshi, who lived with Qian, and plundered it before leaving. When the victims saw the bandits leaving, they quickly reported to the nearby Sixth District, Second Branch. The director of the branch urgently dispatched a senior police officer to pursue them. However, when the bandits were escaping, they saw a villager carrying a shoulder pole coming towards them. They drew their guns and ordered the villager to stop. They stole three silver dollars from him and fled. The villager urgently followed them, and when he chased them to the intersection of Columbia Road and Anheshi Road in the Public Concession, Police Officer 353 of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station and Police Officer 1000, both Chinese and Western, happened to be patrolling in a vehicle. Seeing the villager's frightened expression, the Western police officer stopped the car and asked what was going on. The villager reported the robbery. Therefore, the Western police officer blew his whistle madly, notifying the nearby police officers. Then they drove back along the original road to pursue them. They saw a person running frantically ahead. The Western police officer ordered him to stop. Unexpectedly, the person was a bandit. Seeing that there were police officers behind him, he panicked and took out a pistol from his arms, opening fire on the Western police officer and others. The Western police officer and others also returned fire. After a fierce battle, the bandit saw that his ammunition was running out and, fearing arrest, hastily threw the stolen goods and pistol into the rice field beside the road to escape. However, he was still caught up and arrested by the Western police officer. He picked up the stolen goods and a pistol and took them to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. Under interrogation by the police chief, he confessed that his name was Wu Renru, 24 years old, from Anhui. He used to work as a tea server on the Dehe Wheel, but he had recently lost his job. He admitted to robbing the Qian family and others without hesitation. He also revealed the names of two accomplices, Zhu Chunhai, from Anhui, who lived at 3 Qian De Lane, Changping Road, and a man surnamed Chen, who lived at Yinghua Lane, Robert Road. After obtaining the confession, the police immediately dispatched police officers to arrest them. They arrested Zhu Chunhai, but the bandit surnamed Chen had already fled after receiving the news. At the same time, the Sixth District Police Station also received the news. Because the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the district, they immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau and sent personnel to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station to welcome the captives. After an interrogation, they sent personnel to escort them to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

In 1931, 67,696 long-term tickets were sold, and in 1932, 51,039 were sold. The value of the long-term tickets and the retail tickets at the entrance is quite different, so some people advocated increasing the long-term tickets to two yuan. According to the report of the Director of the Public Works Department, the Zhaofeng Park has the most visitors on Sundays and public holidays. During the Dragon Boat Festival on May 28th, it reached more than 30,000 people, but it is not crowded on weekdays. After studying the matter, the committee members did not consider an increase necessary and decided to postpone the matter until the end of this year for further discussion. This decision has been adopted by the board of directors. Furthermore, the Women's Federation suggested that two Western women be hired in the Zhoushan Park on a trial basis to monitor children and maintain order. According to the Director of the Public Works Department, if this is implemented, it must also be done in at least two other children's parks. Such services are common in other large cities, but in this city, there are concerns that communication difficulties may arise due to language barriers. The need is not urgent at this time, so it seems appropriate to postpone it. After discussion by the committee, it was decided that the park management personnel do not need to be changed. This proposal has also been approved by the board of directors on the 7th.</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan Case Opens</p>
<h3 id="e160">Celebrated Actors Gather in Court <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Jia Biyun and Zhao Junyu Both Testified in Court</p>
<p>Huang Huiting and Xu Junfu Are Suspected of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan, a stage actor at the Samsung Theater, was originally the backstage manager of the theater and also managed the finances. The front desk accountant paid all the surplus from the daily income, after expenses, to Zhao Ruquan for safekeeping. In addition, the advertising fees for advertisements printed on the curtains of the theater were mostly collected by Zhao and not recorded in the accounts by the accountant. Recently, Zhou Bingchen, the manager of the theater, checked the accounts and found that Zhao was suspected of various acts of fraud. The concrete evidence included the aforementioned advertising fees, totaling more than 1,200 yuan. He hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Du Jimei to file an embezzlement charge against Zhao. After investigation by the police, he applied to the First Special District Court for an arrest warrant. One night, in the middle of the night, he specially sent Chinese and Western detectives to the theater. At the time, Zhao was playing Ouyang De in the Peng Gong An play and was arrested while performing on stage. He was sent to court the next day and detained. Until the previous Saturday, Zhao hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Liu Shichao to appear in court and post bail, which was approved. He was released on bail pending trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide held the third hearing. Police lawyers Bo Liang and Ru BaoYi, representing the prosecution, and the lawyers Chen, Du, Jiang, and Liu, representing Zhou and Zhao, respectively, appeared in court. In addition, other shareholders of the theater hired lawyer Wu Linkun to attend the hearing. The friends and relatives of both sides who went to listen were still very crowded. Celebrated actors Jia Biyun and Zhao Junyu, being shareholders of the theater and having worked with Zhao Ruquan, were summoned to testify. Judge Feng first questioned the witness Mao Haishan about Zhao Ruquan's income from advertising fees without recording them in the accounts. Mao's answers were vague. He then summoned Zhao Junyu, who gave a detailed account of the functions of the accountant and the defendant in the theater. Regarding the advertising fees, he said that the defendant had reported them at two meetings, one on December 29th of last year and the other in early April of this year, and had presented the savings passbook from the Siming Bank to his colleagues. However, Zhou Bingchen did not attend the meetings. Jia Biyun was also questioned, and her statement did not differ much from Junyu's. According to the defendant Zhao Ruquan's testimony, they were too busy with the performances to hold any meetings. They were just casual gatherings. Regarding the advertising fees, he had reported them to the shareholders and had a savings passbook to prove it. How could Zhou Bingchen not know? He informed the accountant of everything that happened in the accounting office every day, and he had also notified him of the meetings, but he did not attend. As for the interest on the guarantee deposit from the power company, the accounting office entrusted me to collect it. It totaled only more than 370 yuan, and I immediately informed the accountant to register it after receiving it, etc. The court then summoned Huang Huiting and Xu Junfu, the two accountants, and questioned them briefly. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi then said that Huang and Xu were also suspected of embezzlement. Before filing charges, he requested that they be ordered to post bail to prevent them from escaping. Lawyer Jiang Yiping then stated that the accountant Zhao currently auditing the accounts was hired by the plaintiff. For the benefit of the defendant, he requested that the defendant also be allowed to hire an accountant to conduct a joint review to ensure fairness. Judge Feng then ordered the police that if they had any questions for Huang and Xu, they were allowed to summon them at any time and arrest them immediately if they disobeyed. Before filing charges, they were temporarily exempted from posting bail. The case was adjourned and will be heard again after the audit report is completed.</p>

<p>Compensatory Settlement with the Deceased's Family</p>
<p>Di Chuanxiao, a fourth-class police officer numbered 2350 of the Fourth District General Bureau of Zhabei, was assigned to patrol at the fifth guard post on Datong Road at 3 PM on the 5th of this month. While standing in front of the Zhengchang Rice Shop, he accidentally touched the trigger while wiping his gun, and the bullet hit Zhou Zhangwen, the shop's clerk, as reported in this newspaper on the 6th of this month. Subsequently, the police district believed that the police officer had injured someone and needed to provide compensation. They summoned Zhou Zhouwen, the younger brother of Zhou Zhangwen, to the bureau. After negotiations, the police agreed to pay 100 silver dollars as compensation, and persuaded the shop owner to give 250 silver dollars, but wanted the shop owner to pay the 100 dollars first. The shop owner declined, stating that giving 250 dollars for no reason, as well as coffin and funeral expenses, was already a significant amount, and politely declined the 100 dollars offered by the police, requesting that they find another way to raise it. Well-wishers were very displeased and taught the deceased's brother to claim that the police officer played with the gun because of the shop owner's encouragement, in order to implicate them. The district chief believed that the police officer was not a child, and how could he handle a gun based on other people's teasing? On the one hand, he reached a settlement with the deceased's family regarding the compensation, and on the other hand, he presented the police officer to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday,</p>
<p>he was transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>

The number of elderly and young people crowding into Tianjin has reached more than 30,000 and they urgently need financial assistance for relief. After receiving the telegram, the General Association immediately replied, agreeing to find ways to allocate 400 large bags of relief rice and 100 boxes of relief clothing to be used for relief of the refugees. It is planned to ship them to Tianjin soon. It is reported that since the outbreak of war in North China, the association has allocated a total of 5,000 yuan to the Tianjin branch for the treatment of wounded soldiers and the relief of refugees. The Tianjin branch has also sent detailed reports to the General Association by telegram.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Lawyer Chao Kun Covered in Dung <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨It's Not Easy Being a Lawyer in Shanghai丨</p>
<p>Yang Yinghou, residing in Yang Yinghou's residence at Jingxiu Road, within the Old West Gate, formerly arranged for Tao Fengdi (currently 22 years old) to leave her registered household and become his wife. This arrangement lasted for five years, but their love eventually soured. Tao Fengdi then engaged lawyer He Sui to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the District Court, alleging restriction of freedom. She claimed that after becoming intimate with Yang, she had been subjected to abuse and imprisoned in a wooden cage. Prior to the hearing, Yang Yinghou commissioned lawyer Zhu Fang to publish a notice, claiming that Tao had absconded with over a hundred yuan worth of clothing and accessories on the 27th of last month. Therefore, the plaintiff considered it defamation and changed the request to one of defamation of character. Judge Yang Qianchang held a court session, and the defendant engaged lawyer Chao Kun to appear in court for defense. The judge advised them to settle out of court, but the defendant did not proceed. Therefore, the court debate continued yesterday afternoon. At 2:00 PM, Tao Fengdi and lawyer He arrived at the court to await the hearing, while the defendant Yang Yinghou and lawyer Chao Kun arrived late at 3:30 PM in Chao's car. As soon as the car door opened and Chao Kun stepped out on the roadside, a man dressed in short blue cloth shirt and pants suddenly approached. He held a round lead bucket about two feet high with a lid (similar to a rice bucket). He removed the lid and placed the bucket over Chao Kun's head. The man then fled swiftly, disappearing without a trace. Unexpectedly, the bucket contained a load of rotten dung, and it was stale. Lawyer Chao was as if receiving a "baptism of mud," with thick dung covering his head, body, and feet. Fortunately, he was wearing a straw hat, so his hair and face remained relatively clean. He immediately discarded his hat, removed his long gown, and was left with only a small short shirt. His pants, feet, and briefcase were still covered in yellow stains. He rushed to the courthouse bathroom to wash himself clean, but a lingering odor remained. The hearing for Yang Yinghou's case had already begun in the first courtroom. Lawyer Chao immediately recounted what had happened, stating that today's events were too coincidental, suggesting suspicion toward the plaintiff's side. Lawyer He Sui responded that the plaintiff had been in the courthouse earlier and was a woman, so Lawyer Chao's attack was by a man, and could not be guessed at. Thereupon the judge ordered Lawyer Chao to present the main text of the case, immediately declaring that if Tao Fengdi withdrew the lawsuit, they could discuss a resolution. However, Tao Fengdi refused to withdraw. The official then persuaded them that both parties were willing to terminate their relationship, and since it was not a formal union, it could not be considered formal. The judge suggested that Yang Yinghou provide Tao Fengdi with 200 yuan to fully resolve the five-year de facto marriage. However, Tao Fengdi refused. The debate then concluded, and the official announced that a settlement was still being pursued before the verdict. Both parties agreed and left the court. It was said that the person who dumped the dung had been sitting on the road for four hours, and there was also a basket disguised as a vendor selling zongzi, intending to cause trouble.</p>

The excellence of its products has long been widely praised. Major food stores in Shanghai all sell various Ma Tou brand candies and biscuits on consignment.

The location has already been selected, and a cement and steel structure factory is being built. The machinery is all purchased from the United States and is of a new style, unprecedented in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e174">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news in the "Collection of Fishery Dues for Construction Costs to be Mediated Today" section of your local news column on June 7th, which is far from the truth. I fear that outsiders will misunderstand and cause confusion. I hereby report the facts. Since the establishment of the Collection Office for Fishery Construction Costs of the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industrial Affairs, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Districts, it has been announced that the principle of "taking from fishing and using for fishing" has been established, and the method of collection has been determined, assigning the fish market to collect dues on behalf of the government based on price. Our colleagues believe that this was reviewed and approved by the Central Political Conference, and the original principle was "taking from fishing and using for fishing." As the name implies, "taking from fishing" should naturally be paid by fishermen in the fishing area. Our colleagues are not collection agencies, so how can we collect dues on behalf of the government based on price and bear obligations that we should not bear? At the same time, fish merchants from various ports have protested, sending letters and telegrams, unanimously denying collection by the market. However, the collection office has refused to comply with the Ministry's orders and has forcibly detained goods. Although the goods were returned after arguing with reason, the fresh goods were delayed, resulting in significant losses. Later, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Yu Zuoting, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing strongly advocated for fairness and took the initiative to mediate. However, the officials insisted on their preconceived notions, resulting in unsuccessful negotiations. This is the general situation of the process. Your newspaper said, "Now, four fish markets, including Dacheng Yuanchang, have colluded with stone urn fish merchants in Shipu to unreasonably oppose, clearly being manipulated by a certain country, sowing discord, and there are treacherous merchants acting as accomplices, secretly organizing institutions and attempting to manipulate things behind the scenes," etc. Such absurd remarks are not based on any evidence. However, the facts are all there, and those who are knowledgeable will laugh at them. We have always admired your newspaper for leading the masses and upholding justice. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to correct public opinion and report the facts. Sincerely, The Sixteen Fish Markets, including Dacheng Fish Market, etc. June 9, 22.</p>

<h3 id="e176">"Summary of Japan's Wartime Economy" from the Shen Bao Series <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Compiled and translated by Luo Shu</p>
<p>208 pages, six-point paper size, actual price 60 cents</p>
<p>This book is compiled and translated by Mr. Luo Shuhe based on the "Complete Picture of Japan's Wartime Economy" compiled by Japan's Toyo Keizai Shinpo, with reference to other important materials. The content is extremely rich and valuable, especially in the current extremely tense Sino-Japanese relations. On the one hand, we must have a precise review of the Japanese lineup, and on the other hand, we must have a comparative assessment of our own strength. At the same time, we should have a clear observation of the position of Japan's capabilities in the entire world view. To complete these tasks, this book can just give us considerable help. The main content of this book is introduced below: The book is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 "War and National Mobilization Plan". Divided into four sections, the first section explains the significance of national general mobilization. Modern warfare, due to special technological advancements in the industry, has invented many new weapons, which have changed the method of combat, and the scope of war has expanded to dozens or even hundreds of times more than before. The so-called national general mobilization plan is following the expansion of this scope of war. Section 2 describes the method of national general mobilization. It first describes the types of national general mobilization, including talents, money, and military supplies. In the war, a large number are needed and must be concentrated in a very short period of time; The second section describes the experience of the belligerent countries in the European War in national general mobilization, and divides it into national mobilization, industrial mobilization, and transportation mobilization. In this table, we can see how much the government's control ability can be expanded in wartime. The third section explains the relationship between capitalism and national general mobilization, and clearly points out that there is an inseparable close connection between war and capitalism. The fourth section describes the Japanese Military Industry Mobilization Law. The Japanese Military Industry Mobilization Law is an extremely important document in Japan. This chapter records the entire content and adds a brief explanation. From here, we can have a clear understanding of the basic form of Japan's military industry mobilization. Chapter 2 "The State of Japan's Military Industry". Provide a summary description of the entire state of Japan's military industry, divided into three sections: metal industry, machinery and equipment industry, and chemical industry. A detailed list of Japanese military factories is attached, which is very important for the investigation of Japan's national strength. Section 4 describes the various social consequences resulting from factory mobilization, pointing out that the surge in military supplies will inevitably cause confusion in production organization, high prices, increased exploitation of labor, and increased burden on the people, explaining that war is enough to "promote the maturity of political crisis," clearly telling us the weaknesses of capitalism. Chapter 3 is "An Anatomy of Japanese Government-Operated Enterprises". This chapter is connected to the description of the state of Japan's military industry in the previous chapter, and provides a detailed review of Japanese military enterprises directly under the government's jurisdiction, that is, for "Japanese government-run enterprises, especially in the field of enterprises, on what social and economic basis they originated, what their historical development process is, what their content is, and what is their current task?" to conduct an investigation. A total of six sections are described. The first section explains the definition and types of government-run enterprises, which is the outline of this chapter. The second section describes the occurrence of Japanese government-run enterprises, giving a historical outlook on the process of the occurrence of Japanese government-run enterprises, and at the same time it tells us how huge the content of Japanese government-run enterprises is. The third section describes the content of Japanese government-run enterprises, divided into the investment of government-run enterprises, government-run factories and laborers, the names of Japanese government-run factories, their locations, main products, and the distinction and number of male and female employees, and government-run mines. From here, we can see Japan. Section 4 describes the relationship between Japanese government-run enterprises and national finances, pointing out that Japanese government-run enterprises are based on strong finances, that is, the importance of the national economy, and at the same time, we can see how important non-productive military industry occupies in the entire industry. Section 5 mainly describes the status of government-run enterprises. Japanese major government-run enterprises; communications, national railways, ironworks, monopoly, naval and army factories, land, etc., are explained in sections on the historical development process and the overview of their content. The breadth of the content and the strength of the economic power of Japan's major government-run enterprises can be seen from this. Section 6 explains the relationship between government-run enterprises and national control, pointing out that the "operational trend of Japanese government-run enterprises originated in the Meiji Restoration era, not only in industry, but also in more important military reasons, and adopted an extreme protection policy", "This is why the wartime economy is valued", "The so-called control is the monopoly of state capital" and its purpose is to "develop the military industry." Once a war occurs, "both public and private economies are placed under the new wartime establishment, especially the government-run enterprises that are easier to reorganize are more fully promoted in this direction." This is the content of Japan's wartime economy. Chapter 4 "The Structure of Wartime Economy", points out that Japan's budget has reached the stage of "wartime economy" due to its continuous invasion of our country, and is described in eight sections. The first section explains the situation of the sudden increase in Japan's budget in 1931 due to the Shenyang Incident; The second section describes the large expansion of Japan's implementation budget in 1932, "The implementation budget in 1932 has a very strong color of wartime finance"; The third section continues to explain that the increase in this budget in Japan is due to the expansion of military expenditures. At present, Japan has almost "devoted all its efforts to military preparations" and "temporarily delayed everything". On the one hand, the economic panic is becoming more and more profound, the income is decreasing, the military expenditure is increasing, and the budget is becoming more and more insufficient. Therefore, the Japanese government has added an emergency budget, but this increase in budget is still actually used for military purposes. Sections 4, 5 and 6 detail the budget status in Japan and the issuance of public bonds due to insufficient budget. Section 7 describes Japan's wartime budget in 1933. From here, we can see some shocking figures. The editor said: "With such a large expenditure on time, according to Japan's national strength and the general situation at the moment, it cannot be said to be a miracle!" Indeed, this is a miracle! Chapter 5 "The Trend of Wartime Monetary Policy". Describes Japan's preparation for various policies on inflation caused by the war, such as the "Amendment Law in the Bank of Japan Exchange Voucher Regulations", such as the "Bank of Japan "Payment Money" Bill", such as the "Law on the Calculation of Government Bond Prices," such as the "Law on Preventing Capital Flight", etc. This chapter records their full text and adds detailed explanations. To show that Japan is now completely prepared for war, and its economic state bears the nature of a wartime economy. A table of Japan's main resource supply and demand statistics is attached at the end, which is of great reference value. The above is a glimpse of the main content of the book. Of course, this is just a brief description, and it cannot be said that it is the essence of the whole book. In short, this book is worth reading, whether it is for specialized research or for the supply of general youth knowledge, this book can fulfill its due responsibility, especially at present, this book is definitely not a common reading material, this can be asserted. According to Mr. Luo himself in the afterword, "From the good intentions, Japan has been our neighbor for thousands of years, and the relationship in the most recent 50 or 60 years is particularly close. We should pay more attention to and study its actual situation, especially Japan expressed in numbers. From the non-good intentions, Japan has put us on the operating table and repeatedly dissected and analyzed us countless times. Although its understanding of China is only flat and superficial, it has grasped the key points, at least it can grasp the reality; however, our understanding of Japan is not very much, although we regard it as a hypothetical enemy 丨丨It has become a frontal enemy in the past year and a half, and is in opposition in economic, political, and military terms. There is no hope of reconciliation in the near future, but our understanding of it is not very much. We should examine Japan's wartime preparations more. The motivation for compiling this booklet is also here." It can be seen from this that the value of this book is one aspect. There are more than fifty tables in the statistics.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Middle School Graduation Exams in Beijing are Inevitable <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Report by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Principals of Each Middle School</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) The Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened the principals of public and private middle schools at 9 p.m. to report that the bureau intends to hold a graduation exam for each high school, and that high school students who do not wish to attend the graduation exam will give up their qualifications for graduation. The exam location was originally divided into four locations, but for convenience, more locations will be divided in the future to avoid disturbances from a small number of malicious individuals. In the event that there are still disturbances after the multi-division area, the military and police will severely suppress them. Please advise the students to go to the exam on time, and it was decided that on the morning of the 10th, the principals of each school would lead one or two high school student representatives to the bureau, and the bureau chief would admonish them. According to the talks of the school leaders, the Provincial Beijing High School and Beijing Women's High School are scheduled to hold the graduation exam by the Jiangsu Education Department from the 11th, which is no longer a problem. In addition, there is no problem with the junior high school graduation exam in various schools in Beijing. That is, the situation in each high school is different, and only a few students do not want to participate in the graduation exam. Now each school is holding an internal graduation exam. At first, some high school students in each school went on strike, but after persuasion, there was no foundation, and it was decided to hold the exam as usual on the 12th. It is reported that the high school student representatives of each school still held a meeting at Zhongying Middle School on the afternoon of the 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Ministry of Education Orders Rectification of Peking University, Afterwards <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Acting President Xu Songming Formally Resigns</p>
<p>Various Colleges Discuss Various Steps</p>
<p>Yan Zikai Seeks Instructions on Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Peking University recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education to rigorously rectify all colleges under its jurisdiction. Except for the Colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, which will continue to operate as usual and enroll students as usual, many other changes will be made. The College of Arts and Sciences for Women, due to the small number of students in each class and the uneconomical use of funding and teachers, is ordered to make efforts to reduce and merge departments and report to the Ministry for approval. The Russian Law and Russian Economic departments of the College of Law will be abolished, and enrolled students will be merged into other departments. Enrollment in the Political Science department will be suspended. The College of Commerce will suspend enrollment this year and temporarily maintain the status quo. The College of Art will be closed immediately. The affiliated high school, as there are many such schools in Peiping, will also be closed. Students of the school will be given certificates to facilitate their transfer to other schools. After receiving these instructions, the Peking University Office immediately distributed them to the various colleges and the high school, ordering them to comply and handle the matter. It also telegraphed Principal Xu Songming, who was in Beijing, seeking instructions on everything. Details of each item are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Instructions from the Ministry of Education <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>It is noted that this university, in addition to the Colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, should suspend enrollment in other colleges in order to rectify them. This was previously ordered in the Ministry's Instruction No. 5728 of the previous year, which was to be followed. Now, according to the university's report on the general situation for the 20th year, the College of Arts and Sciences for Women has both arts and science departments, with divisions for mathematics, physics, chemistry, Chinese, English, philosophy, economics, history, and music, totaling thirty-one classes with a total of three hundred and twelve students in the entire college, averaging only ten students per class. The funding and teachers are not economical, so each department should make efforts to reduce and merge departments, and report to the Ministry for approval. The College of Law originally had departments of Law, Political Science, and Economics, as well as Russian Law and Russian Economics. Now, with the rectification of the judiciary and economic construction underway, the Law and Economics departments are still needed, but the Russian Law and Russian Economics departments should be abolished, and enrolled students should be merged into other departments. Enrollment in the Political Science department should still be suspended, so that all efforts can be focused on enriching the Law and Economics departments. The College of Commerce was originally established to cultivate talents for frontier trade. However, there are currently quite a few such talents, so enrollment should be temporarily suspended this year. The College of Art was ordered to be closed earlier and should be closed immediately this year. There are many affiliated high schools in Peiping, so there is no need to continue operating them. The students of the affiliated high school should be given certificates of completion to facilitate their transfer to other schools, so that the school can be closed. This order is hereby issued and the university is instructed to comply with it and report back for record.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Chen Zhongping Discusses Measures <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>This reporter met with Chen Zhongping, secretary of Peking University, to discuss the Ministry of Education's instructions to rectify Peking University. The instructions were issued on the 2nd and arrived at the school on the 5th. On the 6th, the instructions were forwarded to each college. The Ministry of Education's plan to rectify Peking University was decided last year, but due to various difficulties, it could not be fully implemented. With the summer vacation approaching this year, how to handle the matter in the future is naturally a problem. Principal Xu Songming's trip to Beijing was to meet with the Minister of Education to discuss this issue. However, the ministry's order was issued while the principal was en route to Beijing. Currently, the university office is forwarding the ministry's order to each college and the affiliated high school. Each college will discuss the rectification measures in detail. At the same time, they will telegraph Principal Xu, who is in Beijing, to seek instructions on how to handle the matter. It is hoped that Principal Xu will be able to discuss the matter in detail with the Ministry of Education in Beijing and obtain appropriate measures. Once Principal Xu returns to the school, he will convene a joint meeting of the deans of each college to discuss the matter thoroughly, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Xu Songming Has Resigned <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Beijing, Xu Songming, the acting president of Peking University, learned that the Ministry of Education had issued instructions to Peiping, stating that the Colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine should continue to enroll students as usual, while the College of Arts and Sciences for Women should reduce and merge departments, the College of Law should abolish two departments, the College of Commerce should temporarily suspend enrollment this year, and the College of Art and the affiliated high school should both be closed. Xu then decided to resign and telegraphed this intention to Peiping. On the 8th, the University President's Office notified each college and the affiliated high school with the following original text: "Respectfully, we have just received a telegram from Principal Xu, briefly stating that he arrived in Beijing this morning and learned that the Ministry of Education had issued an order for winter reform. He immediately submitted a request to the Ministry to resign and asked to convey this to each dean, Songming. Accordingly, we are writing to you for your information. In addition to distributing this to other parties, this is addressed to the deans of each college and the affiliated high school, Peking University President's Office."</p>
<h3 id="e182">Art College Convenes Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The issue of closing the College of Art had been brewing for two years. The former dean, Yang Zhongzi, professors, and student representatives had contacted the Ministry of Education separately, so it had not been resolved until this year. Now, the Ministry of Education has instructed Peking University that the College of Art had been ordered to be closed earlier and should be closed immediately this year. Upon hearing this news, the faculty, staff, and students of the College of Art gathered to discuss measures.</p>
<p>College Affairs Meeting: The College of Art held a college affairs meeting at noon on the 8th. Committee members Yan Zikai, Luo Jiongzhi, Peng Peimin, Ding Naigang, Zhou Zhaoxiang, Tian Lin, Yang Zhongzi, and Gao Leyi were present. Yan Zikai chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) To request Dean Yan to go to Beijing to contact the Ministry of Education regarding college affairs. Resolved and passed. (2) To send a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting the maintenance of art education. Resolved and passed. (3) To elect professors as representatives to petition the government in the near future. Resolved to discuss this at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at 3 PM.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Education: To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, and Principal Xu of Peking University: We have just received the ministry's order stating that the College of Art had been ordered to be closed earlier and should be closed immediately this year. Upon investigation, this college has never received an order to close. Previously, due to the change to a specialized school, this college experienced difficulties, and representatives were sent to the ministry to explain the situation. As a result, the college system was maintained, and the existing classes were allowed to graduate before the change to a specialized school was made. Therefore, there was an order for gradual closure, which is not related to closure. Peiping is a cultural area, and there are no other national art schools in the surrounding provinces. Since there is no redundancy, why is it being cancelled? If it is said that the college is not being managed well, this is due to various political influences. Moreover, in recent years, the college has been reorganized and seems to be no worse than other colleges. By what standards is it being ordered to close? There are currently more than two hundred students in the second and third grades of each department. Closing the college midway would leave them with no place to transfer and would render them abandoned. The previous order to stop recruiting new students has already threatened the interruption of art education. If the college is closed further, it would be tantamount to crippling it. In accordance with the principle of equal national education, this should not be the case. We fear that the minister is newly appointed and has not examined the original details, leading to this order. Therefore, we are providing a detailed explanation and respectfully request that you reconsider and handle this matter impartially, so that we can be reassured. The remainder will be presented in person by Dean Yan and the elected representatives in a joint statement. Signed by all members of the College Affairs Meeting of the College of Art of Peking University. Yan Zikai Speaks: This reporter visited Yan Zikai, Dean of the College of Art, to inquire about the Ministry's measures. The response was as follows: The college affairs meeting today resolved to request me to go to Beijing. Although I suffer from rheumatism, I will have to go to Beijing despite my illness. I will be leaving for the south tomorrow or the day after. The Ministry of Education's order stated that the College of Art should be closed immediately, but there were no further details. I will go to Beijing to visit Minister Wang and seek instructions on how to handle the matter. As a student of art, I certainly cannot sit idly by and watch art education be interrupted. Moreover, after our college was reorganized, everything was on track. I don't know why it is now being ordered to close. Closing the college is one problem, and how to handle the students after the closure is another problem. Whether there is a possibility of continuing to operate the art school is also a question for the Ministry. I will discuss this matter thoroughly with Minister Wang. First, I hope that the College of Art will not be closed. Second, I will seek instructions on handling the aftermath, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e183">College of Commerce Temporarily Suspends Enrollment <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The College of Commerce received an order from the Ministry stating that enrollment should be temporarily suspended this year. Upon hearing this news, Dean Zuo Zonglun immediately exchanged views with Secretary Zhou Zechang and the heads of each department. As the college is currently holding academic year examinations, the college affairs are more busy than usual, but due to the importance of the issue, it is necessary to study it urgently. Therefore, Zuo notified each member of the college affairs meeting by telephone to hold a college affairs meeting and discussion.</p>
<p>Zuo Zonglun Speaks: Zuo Zonglun, Dean of the College of Commerce, told this reporter that the Ministry of Education's order stated that the College of Commerce should temporarily suspend enrollment this year. The intention is to temporarily suspend enrollment, not to close the college. The issue of suspending enrollment is first, a problem for the entire Peking University, and second, it requires consideration by the faculty and staff of the College of Commerce. Our college was established only a year ago after the change to commerce, and we are in the process of cultivating talents for frontier trade. As for the number of talents, it is still unknown as it is far from the graduation period. The Ministry of Education's order to temporarily suspend enrollment this year may be due to the financial difficulties of the College of Commerce, but how to proceed will be discussed in detail by the college affairs meeting, it is said.</p>
<p>College Affairs Meeting: The College of Commerce held a college affairs meeting at 2 PM on the afternoon. Committee members Zuo Zonglun, Zhou Zechang, Wang Zhixiang, Wang Jin, and others were present. Zuo Zonglun chaired the meeting. Because the meeting was in the nature of a discussion, the steps to be taken were discussed in detail. Because there were still points to consider, the announcement of the resolutions was temporarily postponed, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Gu Deng of the Women's College Speaks <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>According to Gu Cheng, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for Women, the college's views on the Ministry's reduction and merger of departments are as follows: I had heard about the Ministry of Education's intention to reduce and merge the departments of our college when I was in Beijing before. The Ministry had also inquired about my views, but there was no concrete decision. This time, the Ministry's order to our college to make efforts to reduce and merge departments is probably based on the previous discussion, but it does not specify concrete measures. Which department should be reduced and merged will still be decided by our college based on the circumstances, and then reported to the Ministry for approval. As for how the reduction and merger will be carried out in the future, there are currently no concrete measures. It must be discussed by the college affairs meeting and then submitted to the Peking University faculty meeting for discussion. The college affairs meeting will be convened in the next few days, and concrete measures will be decided, it is said. Students are not yet aware of this news, but the students of our college have great confidence in the faculty and staff, and if the school makes a decision, there should not be a strong reaction, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e194">College of Commerce Students Inspect German Mail Ship <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai College of Commerce has a batch of students attached to the Transportation Class, specializing in teaching the procedures of sea transport and the professional knowledge of commercial exchange and loading, which is essential for the development of domestic and foreign trade. The professors of the class believe that the transportation industry also emphasizes experience, which can make up for the inadequacy of knowledge. Therefore, it was decided to select outstanding students to conduct on-site inspections of foreign mail ships in Shanghai. It was decided that the Transportation Class of the college would contact the North German Mail Ship Company for observation matters.</p>
<p>The North German Lloyd Mail Ship Company, managed by the German merchant Meijing Times in this city, has a large presence in the Far East shipping industry, divided into cargo ships and mail ships. Among them, the 10,000-ton-class ships such as the Cebroqi and Difijielin are ships that emphasize both cargo and passengers. The transportation management and procedures on board are the most complete. The College of Commerce had previously obtained the company's consent and decided to send a class of students to the ship to inspect the cargo and passenger procedures of various transports today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the North German Company's mail ship Cebroqi entered the port. It was the ship taken by Zhang Dianjiu, commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, and others to return home. The passenger cabins and cargo holds of the ship are very new and are famous among the new foreign ships. The College of Commerce specially dispatched Professor Yang Dayi to lead 40 students from the Transportation Class to the Gaogong Hexiang Wharf this afternoon to conduct on-site inspections of the cargo and passenger procedures of the transport, in order to learn from each other. The Meijing Times Foreign Firm has assigned Chinese and German staff to the ship to guide, entertain, and explain, it is said.</p>

<p>Changes in Sports Weight Punching Match</p>
<h3 id="e196">Xue Molin Suddenly Suffers Setback <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Defeated by Baja</p>
<p>Xie Gai Will Face Ganella</p>
<p>Punching matches are popular in Europe and the United States, and heavyweight matches are especially valued. In recent years, the authority on the world's heavyweight stage has always been the German Xue Molin and the American Xie Gai. After Jie Ke Tai Mushan fell behind, the heavyweight championship crown was always transferred to the heads of the two. Heroes create the times, and news has been spread remotely that the so-called German heavyweight punching master Xue Molin has suddenly been defeated by Mark Baja. Baja is an American from California, young and strong, and one of the contenders for this year's world heavyweight championship. On the 29th of this month, the Italian "giant" punching master Ganella will meet the American Xie Gai. The winner will compete with Baja, which is a scene of the world heavyweight championship.</p>
<p>The Grand Event of the Competition: Although the battle between Xue Molin and Baja is not a scene of the championship, it is extremely relevant to the future championship. Xue's defeat also means that he has lost his qualification for this year's championship. The two competed in New York on the 8th, with as many as 60,000 spectators. The ticket revenue was also as much as 250,000 yuan. The American economy is prosperous, although it has not yet recovered, but this grand event is enough to know how deep their preferences are. The competition was originally scheduled for fifteen rounds, but until the tenth round, after Xue Molin fell to the ground and got up again, the referee Molinawen stopped Xue Molin from competing again and judged the victory to Baja. At that time, Xue was really unable to deal with it after being knocked down and getting up again. If he had forced it, it would have been in vain.</p>
<p>Process of Failure: In the first and second rounds, the two were equally powerful. From the third round, Xue gradually showed signs of being invincible. In the fifth round, Xue gradually rose and took the lead. In the seventh round, Baja attacked fiercely again and gained the upper hand, and Xue showed weakness. In the eighth round, the situation reversed again, and Xue gained the upper hand. In the ninth round, Baja still cheered up, and Xue appeared clumsy in comparison. In the tenth round, Baja's powerful swing directly forced Xue to retreat to the side of the rope. With a punch with his right hand, Xue fell to the ground. The referee shouted the number. By the time he reached the ninth count, Xue got up, his knees were weak and powerless, and his breathing was short. He still wanted to fight again, but was stopped by the referee, and he was defeated. Baja weighed 203 pounds, and Xue weighed 189 and a quarter pounds. Baja's victory was partly due to this.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Japan Advocates Inviting the Puppet State to Participate <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Philippines is afraid that Japan will use coercion to make it difficult to do the right thing</p>
<p>The Philippine Sports Association will submit it to a regular meeting for resolution</p>
<p>Our Country Has Not Yet Replied to the Philippines Whether to Participate</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila) The tenth Far Eastern Games have been decided to be held in Manila, Philippines in May next year. The Philippine Sports Association had already notified China and Japan to participate. According to the association, our country has not yet replied whether to participate, while the Japan National Sports Association has replied that it must also invite the (puppet) "Manchuria" government, which it created, to participate. The Philippine Sports Association is now quite anxious about this issue, which is not easy to resolve. If the so-called Manchurian country is not invited to participate, Japan may use this as a threat and refuse to participate at the same time. This year's Far Eastern Games will inevitably be less exciting.</p>
<p>However, inviting the so-called (puppet) "Manchuria" to participate is not without problems. The so-called (puppet) "Manchuria" was not recognized by the League of Nations. At the World Games held in Los Angeles last year, Japan also introduced and requested that the so-called (puppet) "Manchuria" be allowed to participate. As a result, all countries did not recognize the so-called (puppet) "Manchuria" and refused to participate.</p>
<p>Another problem that arises is that if the puppet government of Japan, such as the so-called (puppet) "Manchuria", can participate, why are Japan's two colonies, such as Taiwan and Korea, not allowed to participate? The Philippine Sports Association is scheduled to raise this issue for discussion at a regular meeting soon to seek a fundamental solution, it is said.</p>

<p>Beating the Summer Champion Bohimi Two to Zero</p>
<p>A Water War After the Wind and Rain Shows Its Skills</p>
<p>Amazing Performances are Rarely Seen in the Philippine Stadium</p>
<p>(Our Correspondent in the Philippines, Wen Chu, From Manila)</p>
<p>The Donghua football team came to the Philippines. In the first game, it drew 2-2 with the Spanish Club. On June 1, in the second game, it defeated the Bandit Island Summer Champion Bohimi team by two to zero, which was very gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Great Storm Forces Postponement <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The second match, originally scheduled for May 30th, was set to see renewed conflict at the Carnival Grounds football field. However, the weather was uncooperative, with wind and rain throughout the morning and afternoon, turning the field into an impassable mire. This forced a postponement to the (1st) day. Many fans who had prepared to watch the Tung Wah athletes in their second match in Manila were disappointed and went home.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Opponent's Strength Should Not Be Underestimated <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Bohemia Sports Association team are the champions of last year's Manila Summer Football Tournament's Whitebread Cup. The entire team has a fast-moving forward line and a solid defense. Recalling this year's selection of athletes to attend the Manila-Iloilo inter-city football competition, the team drew with Santa Mila in the preliminary round. Furthermore, six players from the Spanish club who played the first match against Tung Wah last Sunday came from this team. Each player is deeply familiar with Tung Wah's tactics and is determined to defeat Tung Wah.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Sunshine After the Storm <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>On the 1st, the weather was clear from morning to noon. At 2:30 PM, a sudden storm arrived, but by 5 PM, the sun was shining brightly and the weather was clear. Many fans assumed that the field would be flooded after the heavy rain and that the match would be postponed again. However, this was not the case. After the rain stopped, although the field was muddy, the organizers, seeing the clear sky and sunshine, believed a match was possible and ordered the game to proceed. They immediately summoned field staff, such as ticket sellers and gatekeepers, to their posts. Unfortunately, very few people knew about the match after the rain, so only a little over two hundred people bought tickets and entered the stadium. This was the lowest attendance record for an important football match in Manila's history. This can be attributed to the unpredictable weather.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Athletes Suffer on the Mire-Like Battlefield <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Before 5 PM, the heavy rain continued to pour down. At 5 PM sharp, the sky finally cleared. The match, decided on short notice, was postponed and began at 5:30 PM. At that time, the sky was full of clouds, the entire field was muddy, and water accumulated in the low-lying areas. The ball was heavy, and the scene was extremely bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Recollecting the Previous Match, Everyone is Cautious <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The first match ended in a draw. Tung Wah was unfamiliar with the field. Due to weather conditions yesterday, each half was only thirty minutes long. Both sides chose their best players to compete. After sixty minutes of fierce fighting, from beginning to end, everyone was in a state of shock. The intensity of the performance was breathtaking, and the tension of the battle was exciting. Tung Wah, aware of the audience's disappointment from the first match, put on a performance that was like two different teams. Their forwards charged with vigor and vitality, and their defenders were as impenetrable as copper walls and iron barriers. It was truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e206">United as One, Collective Will Becomes a Fortress <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's opponent was determined to defeat Tung Wah. Therefore, at the beginning of the match, they applied intense pressure. After failing, they resorted to rough tactics to resist. In the second half, Tung Wah's goal was heavily harassed. Fortunately, goalkeeper Lu Zhong'en was calm and agile, and Feng Yunyou and Li Ning worked together to defend the flanks. In addition, Sun Sijing, Tu Kaiyuan, and Liang Shutang firmly defended the midfield, ensuring safety. As for the five forwards Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, made several amazing long shots, but unfortunately missed by a hair's breadth. Chen Yutian and Wan Xianghua had wonderful dribbling skills, especially Wan Xianghua's accurate corner kicks and crosses, which are rarely seen in the local football scene. In the second half, Chen Jiaqiu and Cao Qiuting interchanged dynamically, proving effective. Although Chen Yutian and Li Yichen scored the two goals for Tung Wah, without Wan Xianghua's passing, it is feared that they would not have succeeded. Therefore, when rewarding merit, Wan Xianghua's contribution should not be overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Opponent's Ferocity is Alarming <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The opponents chose experienced and skilled players. The left defender was the most outstanding, with strong legs and good dribbling skills. Tung Wah's first line of defense was often dribbled past, but Feng Yunyou's long kicks repeatedly repelled the attacks. The right center back relied on his tall physique to display his heading skills, but under Sun Sijing's surveillance, he could not show his skills. The other center forward, left winger, and left inside forward were all fast-running riders. However, they were too eager to score, so several good shooting opportunities were missed, which was useless. Their goalkeeper, Mr. Jia Xieya, was indeed agile. If it weren't for him, the opponent would have lost by at least six goals.</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Full-Scale Attack Begins at the Start of the Battle <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>At the sound of the whistle, the opponent took the offensive. The five forwards advanced in a series, but were intercepted by Sun Sijing halfway. He passed the ball far to Chen Yutian, who went solo towards the opponent's goal. The inside defender came out to resist and also passed the ball far to their left winger, whose shot was caught by Lu Zhong'en. The general audience thought that since the battle clouds had just opened and the situation was so intense, a major battle was in the offing.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Yutian Scores First with a Header, Breaking the Enemy's Goal <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>As the battle clouds opened, the opponent immediately launched an offensive, but our army swept them all out of bounds. At this time, our army displayed its long-range shooting skills. The ball hovered outside the opponent's goal. After four rounds of attacks, they resisted stubbornly, unable to score. The applause and cheers from the stands responded like echoes. Sure enough, Tung Wah got a corner kick opportunity. Wan Xianghua aimed and kicked accurately, landing right in front of the goal. Chen Yutian identified the target and rushed forward, heading the ball before it touched the ground. The ball flew into the net, and Jia Xieya, known as the Iron Gate of the Philippines, was at a loss. He seemed to think the ball came from the sky. Cheers and applause rose from all around, celebrating the victory. The goal was scored nearly twenty minutes into the game.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Taking Advantage of the Victory, Strive to be First <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Having won a goal, Tung Wah's morale soared. The five forwards attacked more urgently, without the courteous and modest demeanor of the first match. They had already learned the lessons from the first match. In the previous match, they were too trusting, allowing the enemy to take advantage. They knew that they had to start with a fierce and strong strategy to succeed. Therefore, led by Li Yichen, the three armies directly attacked the enemy's fortress. Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, and Chen Jiaqiu Wan Xianghua all gave excellent long-range shooting performances. For a time, the enemy's fortress was filled with the footprints of Tung Wah's athletes. Fortunately, Jia Xieya's rescue was effective. Although they did not lose another goal, the Spanish audience at the scene was quite shocked.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Continuing the Effort, Another Record is Set <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and continued the battle. Tung Wah replaced Chen Jiaqiu with Cao Qiuting. The opponent also replaced their left inside forward. Tung Wah still dominated. The five forwards probed left and right, seeking opportunities to attack. Li Yichen and Chen Hongguang advanced side by side. Li Yichen's long-range shooting and dribbling skills were reminiscent of Li Huitang. Once, he kicked from thirty yards away, hitting the corner of the goal and bouncing out. The enemy's Iron Gate was shocked. Later, Wan Xianghua, with Chen Yutian's assistance, charged forward from the left, as fast as lightning. The enemy's right defender could not catch up. He dribbled to a suitable spot and immediately crossed. Li Yichen went forward alone and kicked the ball in, falling to the ground. Even if the Iron Gate goalkeeper had the ability to turn the tide, he could not escape this kick.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Battle Becomes Tighter at the Last Moment <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The opponent was not a mediocre team. How could they be willing to be suppressed for long? A forward with the nickname "Long Legs Immortal" ordered the entire army to counterattack. His long passes were quite effective. The five forwards frequently besieged Tung Wah's goal. Lu Zhong'en in front of the goal suddenly saw the enemy's figure. He was overwhelmed with blocking the incoming balls, high and low. There were two close calls. Once, the enemy's center forward shot directly from fifteen yards in front of the goal. Lu Zhong'en reacted quickly and blocked the ball with his hand, sending it over the goal. Another time, the opponent launched a fast and low ball from the left. Lu Zhong'en could not reach it with his hand, so he kicked it out with his foot. After surviving these two dangerous moments, the entire team switched from attack to defense, becoming more cautious in order to stall for time. Therefore, the opponent's offense and defense were very fierce in the second half, but until the end of the game, they did not achieve any success.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Trying Out New Vacuum Tubes <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Are the vacuum tubes in your radio the latest model? If they are still the old type, then your radio has become outdated. Please replace them with the latest models as soon as possible, which will bring you unexpected results. The replacement method is written below:</p>
<p>227丨丨 This old-fashioned vacuum tube can be replaced by the new 56. The radio circuit does not need to be changed at all. This new tube is very small, which can save space in the radio. The filament current is only 1 ampere, which is 75 amperes less than the 227, so it is especially suitable for radios with poor power transformers. Or, if you want to increase the number of vacuum tubes in your radio, using this new tube will not require any changes to the power section. 224丨丨 This vacuum tube can be replaced by 57 or 58. Sometimes, the primary of the high-frequency transformer needs to be replaced with one with a higher impedance, otherwise the efficiency will be poor. If using 57, the volume control must be reconnected in the cathode circuit instead of the screen circuit. The vacuum tube socket must be changed to a six-pin one. Replacing with this new tube can greatly improve the efficiency, whether it is detection or amplification. Saving filament current is the same as mentioned above.</p>
<p>288丨丨 This full-wave rectifier tube can be replaced by the new mercury vapor tube 82. The filament voltage must be changed to 2.5 volts. The advantage is that the voltage drop of this tube is only fifteen volts, so the output DC voltage can be increased. This increased voltage can increase the volume of the radio. The vacuum tube socket does not need to be changed, but a small high-frequency choke coil must be placed in the center connector of the high-voltage coil of the power transformer to eliminate the high-frequency current from flowing into the power section.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Application of Volume Control on Broadcasting Machines <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>Usually, we call a resistor made of German silver wire a Rheostat (variable resistor). Its purpose is mostly to control the current of the filament. There is another type, which is shaped like a variable resistor, and changes its value by moving a finger arm; however, the place where the finger arm is attached is not German silver wire, but raw materials such as carbon essence; called a Potentiometer or Volume grad (volume controller). As for the difference in their numerical values, the variable resistor is usually only a few tens of ohms; the volume controller is often from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>The usual purpose of a volume controller is to be placed inside a radio to adjust the overload; First picture</p>
<p>Because a radio receives a local radio station, it obtains strong power due to the close distance, causing the received sound to be distorted. The volume controller used to remedy this phenomenon is sometimes used in the radio frequency amplification stage (such as ABC in the first figure), and sometimes in the audio frequency amplification stage (such as D in the figure). As for the comparison of resistance content numbers, it is often a hundred thousand ohms for the radio frequency amplification stage, and often five hundred thousand ohms for the audio frequency amplification stage.</p>
<p>There is another use here, which is to install it on the broadcasting machine to replace the switch. Suppose our broadcasting machine currently has three major parts: speech amplification stage, power amplification stage, and amplitude modulation stage. The microphone (Microphone) is connected to the speech amplification stage, specially for reports on the broadcasting station. The pickup (Pickup) is connected to the grid of the power amplification stage vacuum tube, specially for broadcasting gramophone music. In addition, there is a speech amplification stage connected from another concert hall, specially for broadcasting the performance program of that concert hall to radio listeners with radios. Then the control design is as shown in the second figure:</p>
<p>Second country</p>
<p>In the figure, A, B, and C are three volume controllers; if we only need report programs at this moment, then the arrow in A is moved from point D to point A, the arrow in B is moved to point B, and the arrow in C is moved to point F. This means that when the arrow in A is at point B, its circuit is short-circuited; now it is moved to point A, and there is a high resistance of tens of thousands of ohms between the two lines, so the current flows along the two lines to points 13. These two points are connected to the primary of the power amplification stage transformer. As for moving parts B and C to points D and F, it is just to make them short-circuited. Therefore, at this time, only report programs etc. are in the power amplification part. The low-frequency records or music from the concert hall will not seep in. On the contrary, if we only want the low-frequency music coming from the gramophone through the pickup to enter points 23 to the grid of the power amplification part, then move point A of part A to point B, and leave the arrow of part C on point F, and there will be absolutely no seepage effect. Because when part A is moved from point A to point B, it becomes short-circuited again. In the figure, the other two resistors control the power to the power amplification grid.</p>
<p>This design has two benefits for broadcasting machines: 1. Unlike using a switch for replacement, which has a popping sound that enters the ears of the listener, because it rotates the finger arm of the volume controller, gradually from zero to the maximum ohm value. 2. If we want to have an artistic taste when we report and adjust the monotony of our speech, we may still have a low-volume music as accompaniment, then in addition to short-circuiting part C in the figure, the pickup of part B is still moved to the rotating gramophone: just move the arrow on the volume regulator to a place with a considerable resistance value and not let it reach point D and become short-circuited, then we can hear the reporter's speech and the gramophone music at the same time. (The appropriate position of the finger arm determines the size of the resistance, the size of the resistance determines the business height of the gramophone music; as long as you experiment a little, the adjustment is extremely obedient and can achieve good results.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the screws on the finger arm of the volume controller will inevitably loosen after being turned for a long time. After loosening, the speech music broadcast will seep with firecracker sounds. If we occasionally ignore this reason, we will waste a lot of energy repeatedly investigating other parts and get no results. The author has been fooled by this, so I will add it here.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Travel-Type Super-Regeneration Radio in a Cigar Box <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Sun</p>
<p>In travel-type wireless radios, the most important conditions are to make the mechanism simple and the weight light and small. A simple mechanism makes management very easy when in use, and light and small weight means that when climbing mountains or marching, carrying it with you is neither space-consuming nor labor-intensive. However, in addition to the above two main points, travel-type radios also need good volume, which is usually not easy to achieve. Now let me introduce a radio, the circuit of which can be seen in the first figure. This kind of radio weighs only three pounds without headphones, and because it is made in a cigar box, it occupies a very small place. Ordinary broadcast radio waves can be received, and what is even more wonderful is that it does not use the earth and sky lines (the antenna coil is wrapped around the edge of the box), so the selectivity is also good. When listening in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, etc., it is clear and loud, without any noise.</p>
<p>This kind of super-regeneration</p>
<p>The power of the radio is particularly good. What is even stranger is that the B power only uses four and a half volts. According to actual testing, four and a half volts is enough for you to enjoy it. If there is no B battery, you can also receive radio, but the volume is too small. As you can see in the figure, because the Colpitts Interrupted Frequency Oscillator is used, the space occupied is reduced. The coils are adjusted with split nails, avoiding the trouble of moving coils and increasing the stability of radio reception. The choke coil is made of soft iron sheets one inch thick, two and a half inches long, and one inch wide. Thirty-five American standard enameled wires are enough to wrap around the core for five thousand turns, or you can buy a thirty Henry low-frequency choke coil.</p>

<p>LI Grid coil uses twenty-six B S double silk covered wire, wrapped around a two-inch diameter rubber tube, a total of forty turns. Split heads at the ninth, twelfth, eleventh, twentieth, twenty-sixth, thirty-second, and fortieth turns, a total of seven heads.</p>
<p>L2 Screen coil has a total of seventeen turns, with a split head every turn starting from the ninth turn (wrapped around the same tube as L)</p>

<p>BI Two round batteries for flashlights (2.3 Volts)</p>
<p>B2 B battery one (4.5 Volts)</p>
<p>SI S2 movable rotary nails</p>
<p>Once the parts are prepared, you can receive the radio. First, turn the feedback live nail S2 to the smallest nail head. If there is no screaming sound, then move it down a little, and you must hear the screaming sound in the headphones. Then rotate SI and the dial to receive beautiful programs from all over the world.

<h3 id="e220">Antenna System to Eliminate Noise <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>When listening to beautiful music, the most annoying thing is the disturbance of noise; although some of the sources of noise are due to inevitable atmospheric electricity, most of them are man-made, such as the brightness of neon lights, the movement of trams, etc., which can all make the radio feel noise; what collects these many noises is not the antenna itself, but its accessories, the lead-in wire, so to eliminate noise, you only need to improve the installation of the lead-in wire, which is very effective.</p>
<p>First erect an antenna that is one hundred feet long, with a height of at least six feet above the roof, the higher the better; then make an antenna coupling transformer LI yourself: the winding method is to use a thirty-gauge double-layered yarn-wrapped wire, and wind it in overlapping layers for one hundred and fifty turns on a half-inch square wooden core. The width of the entire coil is 1/4 inch, and a connector is placed at the twenty-fifth turn: the inner end is grounded and the outer end is connected to the antenna; the lead-in wire must use a single wire with metal isolation (i.e., shielding Shield), one end is connected to the connector of L, and the other end is connected to the radio transformer L2. The manufacturing method of L2 is exactly the same as that of LI, except that one end must be</p>

<p>Fixed capacitor, and then connect it to the antenna post of the radio; coils LILI should be immersed in a metal isolation box filled with wax. All metal isolators must be connected to the ground wire to be effective.</p>
<p>Using this kind of antenna device, the test results show that roughly eighty percent of the noise can be completely avoided, and the sensitivity and selectivity of the radio can also be improved a lot.</p>

<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Two Methods of Winding Coils</p>
<p>It is usually difficult to make hand-wound coils neat and tight. Here are two methods that can achieve the above purpose:</p>
<h3 id="e223">Iron Nail Spring Copper Wire Iron Pliers <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>1. An iron nail is inserted into the spring, passed through the wooden tube, and clamped with iron pliers. (See figure) When winding the coil, the copper wire can be automatically withdrawn.</p>
<p>2. If the copper wire used is not the entire pound, then you can tie one end of the copper wire to the window hook, and when winding, people can move from far to near, and good results can also be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e224">How to Avoid Body Capacity <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>When adjusting the radio, the sound is very loud, but when you let go, it is silent. This is because the human body has a capacitive effect on the radio. If the adjuster is a capacitor, you only need to connect its piece to the ground wire to avoid it. For other adjusters, you only need to lay a square copper sheet behind the adjustment handle, and then connect the copper sheet to the ground wire.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Calculation of Power Consumption of AC Radio <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>Although AC radios consume very little electricity, most people lack basic electrical knowledge. Therefore, seeing the many tubes inside the machine and the loud sound, they assume it must be expensive to operate, and dare not use it freely. Some, renting rooms in other people's homes, cannot use it because the landlord is unclear, making it difficult to voice their grievances and feeling quite inconvenienced. In fact, AC radios consume very little electricity. The following two methods can be used to calculate the consumption. Radio owners who do a calculation will have confidence when using it. Those renting in other people's homes can also use it to calculate the exact amount of electricity consumed, which is convenient for both parties.</p>
<p>(1) On the back of an AC radio, there is a small copper plate with the machine's model number, the manufacturer's name, and the wattage consumed per hour. Suppose a certain radio consumes 100 watts per hour. Then, using it for ten hours consumes one kilowatt-hour (commonly known as "one unit," because the meter advancing one unit corresponds to a consumption of 1000 watts). A typical eight-tube, six-circuit radio consumes about 100 watts per hour. If the electricity cost is 16 cents per kilowatt-hour, then using it for one hour costs less than two cents of a silver dollar, which is extremely cheap.</p>
<p>(2) For self-made radios or other electrical appliances, the speed of the rotating wheel inside the meter's small window can be used to estimate consumption. If a certain radio, when in use, causes the meter's wheel to rotate 20 times per minute, then it rotates 1200 times per hour. Then, look at the number of rotations per kilowatt-hour (i.e., 1000 watts, or one unit) marked on the meter. Suppose the meter states:</p>
<p>1 KWH = 7500 REV·of Disc, which means one kilowatt-hour is consumed when the wheel rotates 7500 times. Now, if a certain radio makes the wheel rotate 1200 times per hour, then it consumes only 1200/7500 = 0.16 kilowatt-hours per hour (during the above test, the lights must be turned off, otherwise the result will be inaccurate).</p>

<p>A Large Shipment of Fada Radios Arrives in Shanghai: The most famous American Fada radios are now exclusively managed by the Meida Foreign Firm on the third floor of the Han Mi Dun Building on Jiangxi Road. Recently, many nine-tube radios have arrived in Shanghai. The nine-tube radio has a red-light shielding suppression circuit, making it very convenient for finding stations. It is best suited for use outside Shanghai. It is said that the number of people buying them every day is very large.</p>
<p>Dahua Radio Company has recently invented many types of marine radios, which are very suitable for use on ships. The machines are sturdy and exceptionally convenient, with clear reception and transmission. Currently, various ships on the Yangtze River are ordering them from the company. The company can also manufacture various radios at very reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Radio Receivers in the Plum Rain Season: The most vulnerable time for radio receivers is the plum rain season. With continuous drizzle, cloudy skies, and uncertain weather, the inside of the radio is easily affected by moisture. Circuit components either become moldy and rot or fall off. The most important parts are the resonant circuit coils. The square-frame circuits become moldy, or the resistors and capacitors corrode. As a result, the radio may produce strange noises or become completely silent, as well as various other inaudible phenomena. The radio repair department of Yada Company, located at No. 25 Renji Road in this city, has received a very large number of radio repair requests due to the continuous plum rain. They are currently hiring specialists to handle the repairs and ensure quick delivery. The company is also praised by all sectors for its low prices and perfect repairs.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Talking While Picking Lice <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>"A pheasant world, a lice-ridden building." Is this the opening warning line in a commoner's "Shanghai Ode"? Just eight words, both apt and poignant, give it the value to be passed down to this day.</p>
<p>It's getting hot; the ticks are raising their heads. Alas, this little thing has many names. Moreover, they are mostly recorded in books:</p>
<p>First, there's the tick. Second, there's the [unclear]. Third, there's the bedbug. Fourth, there's the "rich bug." Fifth, there's the stink bug. If the tick were to print business cards, it would already have so many cumbersome titles. But, looking in books, the tick has many, many more names.</p>
<p>Sixth, there's the [unclear]. Seventh, there's the flat tick, as the "Shandu Si Kao" says. Eighth, there's the wood tick, as the "Wu Za Zu" describes. Ninth, there's the [unclear], as the "Shi Wu Yuan Zhu" says. Tenth, there's the [unclear]. Eleventh, there's the wall flea, as the "Liu Shu Gu" says. The tick has even crossed the ocean, and the Japanese call it the Nanjing bug. This is the tick's twelfth fragrant name.</p>
<p>Some say that calling the tick the Nanjing bug is the Japanese intentionally insulting China, because ticks are not a product of Nanjing that is "the only one, with no branches." I say: how can the Nanjing bug be as fierce as the Japanese leech? The three words "Japanese leech" are world-famous. Recently, in the streams along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) railway line, there have been Japanese blood flukes. Alas! This is worth making us turn pale at the mention of bugs.</p>
<p>In the past, Wang Meng discussed affairs while picking lice, and the lice he picked were white lice. Of course, he could pick and talk. But, if a Shanghai resident living in a lice-ridden building wants to imitate Wang Meng and talk while picking lice, hey! If he doesn't pick, all is well. Once he picks, the stinking odor assaults his nostrils, and he doesn't even have time to spit. How can he talk? This is what people in Suzhou say: "Talking is not worth talking."</p>
<h3 id="e228">Ceaseless Flow <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>"Ceaseless flow" is a common saying, and also an auspicious phrase to solicit good fortune. All people engaged in business hope their business will be prosperous, with "ceaseless flow." Therefore, merchants write these four characters on their signboards and in their account books, expressing their hopes.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, today, this phrase is being applied to the "Sichuan War," and has almost become an "unlucky term." Clearly interpreting the literal meaning, it means "The war in Sichuan flows ceaselessly in rotation." It's laughable. Since the founding of the Republic of China, our country has seen domestic wars rising and falling, truly a ceaseless flow. Especially Sichuan Province, for more than ten years, the wars have been cyclical, repeated countless times. Recently, the struggle between the two Lius has caused immense suffering. Now, before the wounds have healed, Generals Deng and Liu are fighting again. With wars flowing ceaselessly like this, how can the people bear it? How can the country survive?</p>
<p>At this critical time of national crisis, the high-ranking commanding officers and senior military officials have such great interest, expending unusual effort, and engaging in a major fight. They are not afraid of the people booing, and not afraid of foreigners laughing their teeth off. I truly admire their deep cultivation. Although the central government has issued repeated orders and telegrams, trying to stop them, these people's excitement is at its peak, and the war is in full swing. They are not willing to stop for a while. It's like siblings fighting in a family, beating each other until their heads are bleeding, and the parents' calls to stop are ineffective. Is this still a family? This is precisely what the enemy calls "an unorganized country."</p>
<p>Alas... the ceaseless bloodshed in Sichuan, the impact of which will cause the entire country to "suffer the consequences."</p>
<h3 id="e229">New Swindling Tricks Using Telegrams <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Recently, swindling tricks in Europe and America have become increasingly bizarre. Some even use telegrams to defraud large sums of money, making it impossible to guard against. As a result, news of victims is heard daily. Here is one example:</p>
<p>Miss Jane Doe is the private secretary of a certain wealthy merchant. The wealthy merchant was traveling overseas. One day, the lady received a telegram from him. The location of the telegram's origin was the European city he was scheduled to arrive in. The telegram read: "Pay attention to the goods sent by Kara. Do not pay more than 1500 yuan. This matter must be kept absolutely secret. Wait for me to return before opening." It was signed with his name. Within a few days, a person claiming to be Kara contacted Miss Joan Doe by phone and soon sent a large box, claiming that it contained famous wine and tax-evading carpets. Miss Joan Doe immediately followed her master's telegram and paid 1500 yuan. After that, the so-called Kara disappeared without a trace. When the master returned and asked about it, he knew nothing about it. When the box was opened, it contained only some old wine and rags.</p>
<p>Telegraph bureaus and shipping companies have repeatedly asked all parties to take appropriate precautions against telegram scams. However, dozens of merchants have already been victimized. In New York City alone, criminal gangs swindled them out of $1,000,000 last year. The situation in other cities in the West is even worse. According to a recent New York newspaper report, fifteen accomplices have been arrested and are being rigorously interrogated, but there is still no progress. The remaining accomplices are still rampant. The president of a Chicago bank was also defrauded of $5,925. Their methods are extremely clever, often falsely claiming that the items being transported contain books, diamonds, famous carpets, famous wines, etc., asking for prices ranging from $400 to $40,000.</p>
<p>The gang seems to be a large organization, and they communicate with each other in various places. Their information is extremely sensitive. Each time a ship leaves the country, they try to copy the names of the people on board and find out their personalities and preferences, so that they can use tricks. Currently, shipping companies and telegraph companies are warning passengers to inform their relatives and friends not to be deceived.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Go Play in the Cold Water <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In this hot weather, we see that clear water, as bright as glass. We also imagine the coolness of the water, which must be more pleasant than drinking soda and shaking an electric fan. We can't wait to plunge in and soak to our heart's content. But don't be reckless! If you can't swim, and if there is no one to guide you, that kind of jump, where the water splashes, are you not afraid to follow Qu Yuan and become a victim? Are you not afraid to learn from Li Xueshi, who jumped into the river to catch the moon and never returned? If you can't swim, no matter how great your ability is, you won't have any strength in the water. Haven't you seen "Water Margin"? Brother Black Whirlwind Li, his tolerance on land is so fierce. In the Xunyang River, he was immersed by the White Stripe in the Waves Zhang Shun until his eyes turned white, his stomach bloated, and he almost couldn't breathe. So I advise you to go play in the cold water, but if you can't swim, you must first learn some basic strokes.</p>
<p>For people in Shanghai who want to take a cold bath, the open-air swimming pool in Hongkou Park is the best. The water is so clean and there are no waves. In the sunset, girls wearing colorful clothes and attendants in Western suits, changed into swimsuits, paddling and playing in the water. Seeing it will make you jealous, "Only envy the mandarin ducks, not the immortals." I guarantee that people will have this feeling! It's a pity that the tickets are too expensive, one dollar for three. If you go to wash every day, it will cost you more than ten dollars a month!</p>
<p>There is also the Gaoqiao seaside resort, which is said to have been very well arranged since last year. It's a pity that I haven't been there to visit. However, from Shanghai to there, you have to take a boat and then a car, and you will be tired and sweaty on the road. You can only try it occasionally. It is really inconvenient to go every day!</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, in the summer, I was still studying in a private school. There was no summer vacation in the private school. When it was time to attend evening school, I felt dizzy and drowsy. I would invite some mischievous schoolmates to take a cold bath in the small river. Soaking our bodies in the water was like eating ginseng fruit. Every one of our thirty-six thousand pores felt happy. After bathing, we could still find crabs, snails, and clams on the riverbed. If we were lucky, we could also find eels and loaches in the holes beside the river. However, we always gave these things to others and never dared to take them home. Because the parents at that time were more stubborn than they are now. A shout would ask, "Do you dare to take a cold bath next time?" We young ones didn't dare to be stubborn, so we had to secretly wash outside.</p>
<p>The small river is a natural open-air swimming pool, always with some earthy smell and muddy taste, how can it be compared to artificial buildings. Modern men and women, seeing the green water, surrounded by countless small grasses, fish swimming, shrimp jumping, and if it is not just right, there are also water snakes swimming, how dare you jump down. Forget it: let this natural swimming pool be used by the village children!</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Harsh Words Provoke a Young Man to Resign and Flee; A Kind-Hearted Girl Mercifully Escorts Her Relatives Here</p>
<p>Huang Manying had already heard from Company Commander Tian that Commander Zhao had a lover in mind, the Yang girl who lived in the same courtyard, presumably this was the girl. Women always like to talk about other people's love affairs with their lovers, and they also like to see other people's lovers. This is something that has nothing to do with them, but they find it interesting. Huang Manying initially had the impulse of curiosity to talk to Gui Zhi. When they had been talking for a long time, she felt that Gui Zhi was also a very good person, so she opened the white cloth package. It was a gray silk vest and two pairs of wool socks. Huang Manying smiled and said, "This vest is filled with silk floss, which I sewed myself. I knitted half of these two pairs of wool socks myself, and asked someone else to knit the other half. These times, Company Commander Tian was busy with affairs in the camp because the road to the city was far, so he didn't succeed in going. He wrote me a letter, teaching me to deliver it to Commander Zhao's house. It's just that he didn't make an appointment, so I don't know what day is best to send it. Therefore, I rushed to get the things done, and ran over today. As for running into an empty house, I didn't expect it." Gui Zhi said, "Were these all done by Miss Huang and Company Commander Tian?" Huang Manying, hearing these words, felt a little inconvenient to answer directly, and just smiled as she reached out to adjust her hair. Gui Zhi said, "It doesn't matter, you put it down, and we will give it to Commander Zhao, and this will be transferred to Company Commander Tian's hands. We know that these are important things, and we will definitely not break them." Huang Manying laughed: "If you say that, I would be too stingy. These things can't be pinched off a piece, or bitten off a piece, so what am I worried about." As she spoke, she rolled up the package, put it on the kang, and got up as if she was about to leave. Gui Zhi suddenly exclaimed, "Oh! Miss Huang, you can't leave. It's too late to go into the city now." Huang Manying said, "Why? Is the city gate closed this early?" Gui Zhi said: "The long-distance bus passed by at four thirty, this time, it's five o'clock. If you take a rickshaw into the city, it will be dark on the way." Aunt Jiang said: "Yes! It gets dark early now, and it is a bit inconvenient for a young lady to be out alone." (95)</p>

<h3 id="e232">Gold Standard Rebounds 5.5 Yuan <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Demand and Supply Do Not Show a Clear Advantage</p>
<p>The gold market opened with a rebound yesterday morning, with short sellers rushing to cover their positions, and market sentiment seemed stable. However, the situation weakened after the opening, and the market then moved from weakness to a more peaceful trend. Overseas silver markets in both Britain and the United States rose, but the increase in forward silver prices was not satisfactory. American cotton fell 14 pounds. American wheat also decreased slightly. Stocks arrived late, with gains exceeding losses. After the opening, the exchange rate hardened, and HSBC posted higher rates. Demand from [unclear] account holders increased. The market gradually flattened near the noon close. In the afternoon, upward momentum quickly turned downward, with large account holders aggressively selling. Speculator Wu made significant sales, but without significant purchases from the Guangdong group, the market reverted to its original state. The market fluctuated. Throughout the day, cash dealers such as Tong Feng Heng aggressively sold over 1,100 bars, while the Guangdong group purchased over 900. Dealers also entered the market. The main reason for the sharp increase in the morning was the large difference between the increases in the US/English and English/US rates, in order to prevent exchange rate retracement. As for the report about the proposed establishment of a gold-denominated unit, it did not have a significant impact on the gold market. The net cost, calculated including the premium, was 74 yuan. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 923.8 yuan, an increase of 10.08 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 23.5 yuan. The exchange rate was firm in Britain and tight in the US. The selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 3.25 pence for British exchange and 26.0625 yuan for US exchange. After the opening, Yuan Chun Heng Xing made purchases, but because the September US dollar rate of 0.625 was not in demand, Chun Yuan, Shui Shun, Li Yuan Heng, Yu Fu Chang all sold. HSBC blocked the July US dollar rate of 1.875. Tong Feng Heng was the most aggressive seller and seemed to have prior knowledge that HSBC would raise the British rate by 0.125 and the US rate by 0.25. Yuan Kang, Xiang Fu Chang, Zhao Feng Chang sold aggressively, and the price broke below 20 yuan. HSBC blocked the July US dollar rate of 2.5. China-Belgian Bank offered the August rate at half a yuan. At this time, the price had fallen below 19 yuan. Before long, HSBC blocked the September US dollar rate of 0.75, and market sentiment weakened further. Yuan Xing Fa also came to sell, and the price gradually declined to 16 yuan. Heng Yu Yi Feng Yong Fu Yu Wu took advantage of the low prices to buy, gradually pulling the price up. As the September US dollar rate of 0.75 became difficult to settle, Tian Feng Yong, Zhao Feng Chang rose above 21 yuan. However, MacKay &amp; Co. sold the October US dollar rate of 0.9375. Mitsui picked up the August rate at one jiao.</p>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 918.3 yuan, with goods opening at 8.6 jiao. Da Xing Yong Fu Chang repeatedly sold off. Yuan Sheng Yong Yong Feng also sold. MacKay &amp; Co. blocked the September US dollar rate of 0.75, causing the price to fall to 8.5 jiao and then to 14 yuan. China-Belgian Bank picked up the October US dollar rate at 27 yuan. Heng Xing, Yuan Mao Yong Fu Yu took advantage of the low price to buy, but it reached 7 yuan. China-Belgian Bank offered the September rate of 0.6875, which was slightly lower. However, Heng Xing's buying interest was strong, and they continuously absorbed the supply. Mitsui picked up the September rate at 0.75. Before long, the September rate of 0.6875 became difficult to settle. Zheng Chang Heng Yu Fu Yu Yuan Mao Qian Chang Xiang and others jointly bought, pushing the price up to 20.3 yuan. Da Mei Mei Feng HSBC blocked the September rate of 0.625. Bing Xing sold, causing the price to fall. Heng Xing, Rui Kang bought, struggling against the downward pressure. However, HSBC offered the August rate of 0.4375. Da De Cheng came to sell, making the price 7 yuan. Da Neng picked up the September US dollar rate of 0.625. Heng Yu rose to 20 yuan, but China-Belgian Bank sold the current month's US dollar rate of 0.125. Heng Yu bought and then sold, causing the price to be 7 yuan again. However, the closing price was 918.5 yuan, with goods closing at 8 yuan. Later, Yuan Mao Yong and others bought, raising the price to over 20 yuan. The highest price of the day was 923.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 914 yuan, with a fluctuation of 9.8 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 5.5 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 25.625 yuan, which was 0.25 yuan higher due to HSBC's higher US dollar rate, equivalent to a gold standard price of over 936 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 18 yuan higher, which was about 14 yuan higher than the previous close. The current month's entry price was 933 yuan, and the July price was 920 yuan. The water payment in the morning was 933 yuan, and in the afternoon it was 932 yuan. The net cost, calculated including the premium, was 74 yuan. Only Da Feng Heng sold to Ying Feng Heng in the market, barely making do. There was no source, and the market was sluggish. Rui Kang was willing to offer an 11 yuan premium for swaps between June and July, but there were no takers. There were still 4,879 strips remaining for the current month.</p>
<p>Late in the trading session, buying was strong, but the banks aggressively sold for hedging, and the supply was also large. Therefore, the forces were balanced. In summary, Heng Xing Sheng Yuan Yuan Mao Bing Xing Yuan Chun Tian Feng Yong Rui Kang Qian Chang Xiang and others all bought. Shun Li Wan Xing Fu Chang Da Xing Yong Tong Feng Heng Yong Feng Zhao Feng Chang Da De Cheng Yuan Xing Yong Rui Xing and others all sold.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market remained chaotic, with fluctuating prices and uncertain sentiment. Major players were evenly split between buying and selling, oscillating within two or three jiao. The overall trend was weak, with no significant changes expected in the short term. The market environment was dull, and the bond market also experienced minimal fluctuations, with low investor interest and sluggish trading. In the morning session, the initial trend followed the previous day's closing gains, improving by two or three jiao, but it soon lost momentum. Forward salt tax contracts fell by one jiao and five fen. The subsequent session saw a uniform decline of one to two jiao, down to five or six jiao. The afternoon sessions were even more erratic, with twenty-year bonds moving in opposite directions to eighteen- and nineteen-year bonds.

<p>A report from Newfeng Foreign Firm indicates that the New York stock market on Thursday (the 8th) experienced mixed fluctuations. Initially, it remained strong, but it subsequently weakened due to the sudden bankruptcy of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. Later, the railway authorities claimed that the line had sufficient funds to pay the July interest and had no intention of reorganizing under bankruptcy law, so it quickly recovered. Gold mining stocks rose sharply again, creating a new high price for the year. Homestake reached $350. Silver stocks rose due to the possibility of solutions to silver issues at the World Economic Conference. The total daily turnover was 6.36 million shares. The Dow Jones futures index is listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market continued its downward trend, with weak overseas cotton markets further impacting downstream industries, leading to negative sentiment. Speculators were particularly panicked, and sellers took advantage of the situation, causing prices to fall dramatically. The recent month broke through 190 yuan. In the afternoon, news of a rise of five or six yuan in a certain country's yarn and rising raw cotton prices led some profit-takers to cover short positions, causing the market to show signs of recovery. The price had fallen by ten yuan from its peak.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Human Label Drops by Over Two Yuan <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The morning market for human label cotton opened with further declines in American cotton, creating a weak atmosphere. Prices fell by two or three yuan across all months. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized, and the steep decline triggered profit-taking and covering, with prices rebounding by one yuan and one or two jiao across all months. The total daily turnover was 79,100 bales. Yichang sold 4,250 bales, Gengfeng 1,800 bales, Dafeng 1,850 bales, Suilong 1,200 bales, Hengchang 2,500 bales, Dachangcheng 2,050 bales, and Taichang 2,410 bales.

<p>Inland 35 Hubei &amp; Anhui 5 Fujian 10</p>
<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline and afternoon rise, with extremely volatile conditions. Japanese resistance to Indian cotton made it difficult to predict the market. However, overseas American and Indian cotton markets consistently declined, leading to stable sentiment. In the afternoon, news that Japanese merchants were heavily buying spot cotton caused the market to suddenly rebound. Buyers believed that old cotton stocks were depleted, leading to strong squeeze sentiments. The future situation is difficult to predict.</p>

<p>The morning market for Zheng label cotton opened with a sharp decline in Indian cotton, leading to a weak atmosphere and strong selling pressure.

<p>(Pinghu Cocoon Business Has Ceased Weighing) This year's cocoon production is only about 40-50%. Only a dozen or so cocoon businesses opened, and the amount of cocoons collected was insufficient. Farmers' silkworm costs were not low, so they insisted on high prices before selling. As a result, many people in Nan Shuanglin and other places spun their own silk. Cocoon businesses have all stopped weighing. The highest price for improved variety cocoons was 55 yuan, and the lowest price for native cocoons was 25 yuan.</p>
<p>(Danyang New Cocoon Production Quite Abundant) Farmers who raised improved varieties accounted for 80%. The silkworm season was quite good, with the new cocoon harvest about 80% of a normal year. The quality of the cocoons was also excellent. Cocoon businesses competed to buy high-quality cocoons, with the highest price being 50 yuan and the lowest being 28 yuan. The average price was 32-33 yuan. Cocoon businesses have stopped buying.</p>
<p>(Changzhou Cocoon Businesses Mostly Stopped Buying) Cocoon production averaged 70-80%. Many people in the eastern countryside raised foreign varieties, so the cocoons were of better quality. Cocoon businesses opened for over a week, and the amount of cocoons collected was not small. Most have stopped buying. The price of cocoons was highest for foreign varieties, with private deals in the eastern countryside reaching 60 yuan. When goods arrived, the price returned to 50 yuan on weighing day. Native cocoons were 35-36 yuan.</p>
<p>(Dongting Mountain Cocoon Production Only 50%) This year, farmers in the eastern and western mountains of Dongting were economically impoverished, so the amount of cocoons raised was reduced. Cocoon production was only about 50% of previous years. Improved variety cocoons were 60 yuan per load (Sima weight), and native cocoons were 34 yuan per load.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Not Quiet) Yesterday, merchants from Chang'an, Haining, and other places brought 38 cases of June futures contracts for brands such as Lady Junzi and DPS Shijintu, with prices ranging from 167.15 yuan to 155.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Silk Merchant) New York silk prices continued to rise. Raw silk has risen by one dollar and ninety cents. Silk is also very popular. White factory spun silk sold 500 bales, white dry spun silk 160 bales, yellow factory spun silk 100 bales, Sichuan factory spun silk 12 bales, and coarse yellow silk 13 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Tongfu, Tianyu, and other firms dealing in Gao Zhuang Fine Eyebrow Green Tea all received responses to their telegrams sent in previous days, so they all began to take action. The price of Gongxi tea from the eastern Wuyuan area had already opened at 150 yuan. Gao Zhuang goods sold well. In addition, Zhucha and other varieties of tea from local estates, as well as Needle Eyebrow and Beautiful Eyebrow teas from mountain estates, all had lively sales routes. Green tea had slightly improved. Although there was no significant development in Qimen Black Tea, sales prices had fallen to their lowest point, and exchange rates had eased in recent days, making prices more affordable. As a result, Jardine Matheson resumed operations, and the market was more lively than yesterday.</p>

<p>The Qimen Tea Industry Association pointed out that the government had long issued orders to implement the kilogram system for weights and measures, but foreign firms exporting tea still used the pound system, resulting in significant losses for merchants. It has been reported that they have telegraphed the Shanghai Foreign Firm Tea Industry Association to request a correction in order to respect the law and protect the interests of merchants.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was 30-40 ships, and the outbound traffic was slightly lower. However, sellers tried their best to boost sales due to the cloudy weather. However, due to limited outbound traffic, only Suzhou japonica rice increased slightly, while other varieties such as Changbang and Lianggang japonica rice, Tianjin and Weihaiwei varieties, and 1,000 odd bags of office rice remained unchanged. Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sixi, Lian and other thin rice varieties were all stable. There was no major change in the market. Only Yinyuan rice sold slightly better, and the Shanghai price was stable. Bianyuan rice did not change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 17-18 ships from various routes along the river. Although the wholesale of white japonica rice was not strong, the market was brisk due to the cloudy weather and the willingness to buy. The market was stable and slightly higher, with prices firm. The arrival of early thin rice was smooth and prices were stable. There were few arrivals of Yangjian rice, and the outbound traffic continued, with prices remaining tight by several points. Dubu kejian and Yinbianyuan rice were stable.</p>

<p>(Hunan and Jiangxi Indica Rice and Foreign Wheat Continue to be Small)</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were continued arrivals of Indica rice, although in small quantities. In addition to Hunan and Jiangxi Indica rice, Anhui, Nanjing, and Jiangbei varieties were also loaded. Sellers were eager to sell for cash, so the prices of Hunan and Jiangxi varieties continued to fall. There were fewer arrivals of Anhui, Jiangbei, and Nanjing varieties, and Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants inquired about them, so the market gradually recovered and increased by four or five points yesterday. Small machine-ground foreign rice also fell by five points. Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Fujian merchants bought Hunan and Jiangxi rice, and the other mixed varieties were bought by Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants. Wenzhou and Taizhou appetite increased, while Fujian appetite was slightly lower, so the amount of outbound traffic was similar. Daily transactions included 186 bags of Jiangxi machine-ground late rice at 8.26 yuan, 800 bags of Hunan machine-ground oil rice at 8.5 yuan, 450 bags of Qiyou rice at 7.3 yuan, 753 bags of Nanlu rough rice at 6.65 yuan, and Jiangbei machine-ground Indica rice at 7.4 yuan. Small machine-ground rice was priced at 7.75 yuan, and the prices of secondary grades also fell.</p>

<p>After the market opened in the morning, foreign wheat prices rose slightly. The flour merchants jointly requested that the authorities postpone the shipment of American wheat, which was already loaned, for half a year to help the people of Jiangsu and provide a livelihood for the farmers who depend on new wheat. The factories believed that flour prices were already low, making it unprofitable to sell further, and hoped that the authorities would approve the request to delay the shipment of American wheat to China, which would turn the market around. Therefore, they unanimously sold, and the northern merchants, who had an appetite for flour, immediately rushed to buy and load. Shorts and speculators also tried their best to buy and cover, and futures flour was particularly absorbed by small investors, so the price gradually improved. The market improved even further in the afternoon, with closing prices higher: June/July up 1.25, August up 1, September up 1.75, and October/November up 2.25.</p>
<p>The wheat market continued the previous day's decline in the morning, and merchants sold even more aggressively. More wheat from producing areas was sold, and prices continued to fall sharply, with distant months down by 4-5 points and nearby months down by 1-3 points. In the afternoon, due to the request to delay the shipment of American wheat, sentiment stabilized, and factories competed to buy. Shorts covered, and prices suddenly rebounded by 5, 6, 7, or 8 points. As a result, prices rose by 2, 3, or 4 points. 200 bags of new wheat from Wujiang were opened, and the price remained at 4 yuan. With fewer arrivals, the market outlook was positive.</p>

<p>Soybean oil demand from various regions was weak, so market sentiment turned soft, but merchants were still firm in their intentions. However, peanut oil prices were stable due to the scarcity of arrivals and stocks. Soybean cake demand has been sluggish recently, and the market is temporarily in a holding pattern. Vehicle beans once rebounded, but were affected by continuous declines, and saw a slight correction of 3-4 points. Sales of other beans were also low, and the market remained stable.</p>

<p>White lead sheets, which had been out of stock for many days, arrived yesterday from England, with 500-600 barrels unloaded at the Huashun Wharf. The prices of 80-90 grades were quite good, selling for 24 taels, while the price of No. 2 was very weak due to the scarcity of supply to Guangzhou. It was reported that it only sold for 24 taels and 5 qian per dan, which was more than one tael lower than before. In addition, there were few changes in other colors.</p>
<p>Tin, which had been out of stock for many days, arrived in new shipments yesterday at Swire Warehouse, Jinliyuan Wharf, etc. There was no fear of a shortage of goods on the market, and the price was unchanged from the previous day.</p>

In the fuel category, kerosene continued to fall and firewood weakened, so the index fell sharply by 7.4% compared to the previous month. However, due to the larger weight of the food category index, which rose by 0.9%, and the miscellaneous category index, which rose by 2.5%, the resulting overall index still rose slightly.

<h3 id="e255">Ode to the Night <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>Those who love the night are not only the lonely, the idle, the incapable of fighting, the afraid of light.</p>
<p>People's conduct, both in the daytime and in the deep of night, under the sun and before the lamp, often appears different. Night is the profound celestial robe woven by nature, universally covering all people, making them warm and secure, unknowingly gradually shedding their man-made masks and garments, nakedly wrapped in this boundless, black fluff-like mass.</p>
<p>Though it is night, there is also light and darkness. There is dim light, there is gloom, there is reaching out and not seeing one's palm, there is pitch-black chaos. Those who love the night must have ears to hear the night and eyes to see the night, freely seeing all darkness in the dark. Gentlemen walk from under the electric light into a dark room, stretching their lazy waists; lovers walk from under the moonlight into the shade of trees, suddenly changing their expressions. The arrival of night obliterates all the transcendence, unity, vagueness, suddenness, and brilliance written by men of letters and scholars on dazzling white paper in the light of day, leaving only the nightly air of begging, pleasing, lying, deceiving, boasting, and playing tricks, forming a brilliant golden halo, like that seen in Buddhist paintings, enveloping the heads of extraordinary learning.</p>
<p>Those who love the night then receive the light given by the night.</p>
<p>The high-heeled modern girl walks vigorously on the street under the electric light, but a little oily sweat also sparkles on her nose, proving that she is a beginner in fashion. If she were grown in bright illumination, she would encounter the fate of "decline." The darkness of a long row of stores helps her, allowing her to slow down the full horsepower and take a breath, at which point she feels the refreshing cool breeze in the night.</p>
<p>Those who love the night and the modern girl then simultaneously receive the grace given by the night.</p>
<p>One night has ended, and people carefully get up and come out again, and the faces of the couples are so different from five or six o'clock before. From then on, there is liveliness and clamor. But behind high walls, in the middle of tall buildings, in deep boudoirs, in black prisons, in guest rooms, in secret agencies, a startling, true, great darkness still pervades.</p>
<p>The current bright daylight, with its bustling crowds, is the decoration of this darkness, the golden lid on the jar of human flesh sauce, the snow cream on the ghost face. Only the night is still honest. I love the night, and in the night, I compose an "Ode to the Night."</p>
<h3 id="e256">Dilemma <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Ji Yun's "Notes from the Cottage of Close Observation" records that a certain widow took her orphaned son and her elderly aunt to flee and cross a river. The current was very rapid. In the middle of the river, the elderly aunt was swept into the water. The widow hurriedly put her orphaned son aside to rescue her elderly aunt. Who knew that after rescuing her elderly aunt, she lost her orphaned son. The old woman, having saved her old life, rebuked the widow, saying, "What is the use of my old life? The only bloodline of a certain family is this orphan! Now that the orphan is lost, what is the use of my old life!" But if the widow had held her orphaned son and ignored her elderly aunt, others would surely rebuke, "This kind of woman is too heartless! She only loves her own son and doesn't even care about her mother-in-law!" Ji Yun said it well: in the middle of the river, the situation was critical. Putting the son down and rushing to save her mother-in-law, there was no time to think. It was truly not easy for a certain widow to be a person. "Straight" brought rebuke, and "horizontal" also brought rebuke, leaving her with no way out!</p>
<p>Now, the position of a group of friends who wield pens is exactly the same as that of a certain widow. If you want to offer loyal advice or criticize the current situation, some will say that you have an X or Y color, and that you have already eaten "radishes." If you change direction, not criticizing politics but criticizing society, others will laugh, "Are you talking about romance now! Hmph!" But if you change direction again, not criticizing politics or society, and praising the wise rule like others, will you escape praise and blame? Immediately, others will suspect that you want to steal their rice bowl and will gossip even more mercilessly. There is a Western story of a father and son riding a donkey. It was not good for both to ride, and it was not good for both not to ride. It was not good for the father to ride and the son to walk, and it was not good for the son to ride and the father to walk. Helpless, they had to lift the donkey together, both sweating profusely while carrying it, and the donkey didn't know where to complain. Today's literati truly find it difficult to be people no matter what they do!</p>
<h3 id="e257">George Bernard Shaw in Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw was welcomed by the general public when he arrived in Shanghai, but he encountered indifference everywhere he went in Beiping and Tianjin. When the train he was riding arrived in Tianjin, a group of students who admired him came to the station to welcome him, holding a banner that read, "Welcome to Our Great George Bernard Shaw." Who would have thought that Shaw would not appreciate this flattery and slammed the window shut in front of the welcoming crowd. A journalist standing next to him said to him, "Have you arrived in Tianjin and you still don't know?" Shaw replied, "Tin and Zinc? Of course I know."</p>
<p>Shaw stated very early that he was coming to China to visit Beiping and the Great Wall. But when he arrived in Beiping, apart from "Young Marshal Zhang" arranging his residence, the educational and intellectual circles of Beiping and Tianjin were completely silent. Apart from carrying short news reports, the press was unusually disrespectful in their reviews of him. They all felt offended by Shaw's statement that "China has no culture to speak of," believing that Shaw used the same tone as that of satirizing Mrs. Warren and her priest to ridicule China, which was truly shameful. But in reality, Shaw came to China with good intentions. He felt that China did not have much culture, and this was probably also the truth that many Westerners saw. Which book published in London promotes Chinese culture?</p>
<p>Based on our speculation, there are approximately three reasons why the educational and intellectual circles of Beiping and Tianjin ignored Shaw. First, most people did not know who Shaw was. I remember that on the day before Shaw arrived in Beiping, a professor in the Department of Sinology at a certain university outside Heping Gate read the newspaper in the lounge and exclaimed in astonishment, "Hey, there are actually foreigners named Xiao?" This was widely told as a joke. Second, they were afraid of losing face. The intellectual circles of Beiping have always respected Plato's saying that "knowledge is virtue," and their cultivation is very deep and broad. They felt that Shaw did not have a gentlemanly demeanor at all, and that his opening remarks were "vicious sentences," so rather than embarrassing themselves by welcoming him, they chose to ignore him. Third, they were not of the same kind. If Bertrand Russell or John Dewey had gone to Beiping and Tianjin, even the directors of education and university presidents there would have had to come forward to shake hands with them. But Shaw was just a writer of humorous texts, and he was really not qualified enough. This kind of psychology is just like that of Forgthe described by Shaw's comrade John Galsworthy in "The Man of Property," "suspicion for the wise, contempt for the artist." Therefore, the educational circles of Beiping (not referring to the entire group) only knew how to ensure the safety of their salaries, and how to open shops in the name of righteousness after receiving their salaries (but they were not pure at heart). In return for the cold treatment that Shaw received in Beiping, they only expressed the insensitivity of a group of corrupt elements. No wonder he went to Japan and the first thing he did was to meet with Marshal Araki.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Seven Days in a Hospital Bed (Continued) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiong Xiang</p>
<p>May 22nd</p>
<p>The person from Shaoxing in the room is the most interesting, always talking and laughing. What she says often makes everyone in the room unable to stop themselves from smiling, forgetting their illness. She refuses to tell the truth about her life. Judging by her demeanor, she is not someone who can forget her worries, but she is very happy. The woman from Hubei eloped with a man and severed ties with her parents. Life hasn't been good since she left, and she often covers her face in the bed and sobs. She looks like a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl, but her heart has already experienced hardship. The woman from Jiangxi is a large woman. Her husband works in a factory and never has time to visit her. I heard that he can only earn forty cents a day, but the third-class ward costs fifty cents. The woman from Guangdong seems to have a better family situation, but she lies in bed all day without saying a word.</p>
<p>Today I discovered that the Jiangxi woman doesn't have enough vegetables. She can only be half full at each meal. I gave her my portion because Ming-ge had sent me extra vegetables. The hospital's vegetables are only in two thin small dishes. I don't know if they are afraid that the patients will get sick from eating too much, or if people in the third-class ward should eat less.</p>
<p>Ming-ge looked at my diary and seemed unhappy. I knew it was because my dream the night before touched his hidden feelings. That dream is truly cursed. But it's like a night owl, attacking my heart, impossible to get rid of. I also know that I shouldn't have had that dream. Lian-sheng is the night owl, isn't Ming-ge my loud rooster crowing at dawn? I want to face the dawn and never return to the darkness. Goodbye, Lian-sheng? I don't want to dream of you again.</p>
<p>May 22nd</p>
<p>The Jiangxi woman didn't pay her bill. The doctor said that hospitalization costs money and they can't do charity, so she had to move out. The Shaoxing woman also left in the afternoon. The Guangdong woman had surgery. Now that the surgery has healed, she is being moved to the internal medicine department. Only the newcomer and I are left here. The woman from Hubei paid two dollars. She calculated it several times and said that she had already stayed for several days and couldn't stay any longer, and her illness was not getting better, so she was very anxious. I had prepaid seven dollars, so I was considered to have the best situation among them and could stay for fourteen days. The regulation is that the third-class ward requires a fifteen-dollar prepayment, but no one in the third class has that kind of ability. It shows what kind of people are in the third-class ward. This hospital is not doing charity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Hubei woman asked the tea boy to go to the accounting office to calculate the bill and wrote a letter to the doctor requesting a fee reduction. It is unknown what the result was. She immediately got dressed and went out. Soon another newcomer came in, so the room was still just the newcomer and me. Ming-ge sent a lot of food again today.

<h3 id="e259">Carrot Top <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— By Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Mathilde</p>
<p>"Mama, do you know?" Sister Ernestine came running to Mrs. Lepic, breathless. "Carrot Top and little Mathilde are pretending to be husband and wife in the pasture. Brother Felix is dressing them up. I remember you said we weren't allowed to do this, if I remember correctly."</p>
<p>Indeed, little Mathilde stood motionless in the pasture, adorned with wild clematis vines with white flowers. She was dressed up so colorfully, she looked like a real bride decorated with orange blossoms. She also had something to ease all the pain of life.</p>
<p>The clematis vines on her body were initially woven into a circle worn on her head, and then hung down one by one, under her chin, on her back, on both arms, curling around her body, all the way to the ground, dragging into a tail. Brother Felix also tried his best to lengthen this tail.</p>
<p>He stepped back a few paces and said:</p>
<p>"Don't move! Now it's your turn, Carrot Top."</p>
<p>Now it was Carrot Top's turn to dress up as a young groom. He was also covered in clematis vines, dotted here and there with poppies, dandelions, hawthorns, etc., to make him look different from Mathilde. He didn't mean to smile; all three of them looked very serious. They knew the attitude to take in every kind of ceremony. Participating in a funeral should always look sad; participating in a wedding should remain solemn before the end of the mass. Otherwise, playing would be no fun.</p>
<p>"You have to hold hands," Brother Felix said. "Go forward! Don't be too fast."</p>
<p>The two of them stood loosely side by side, keeping pace as they walked forward. When Mathilde found it difficult to walk, she rolled up the long train made of clematis vines and held it in her hand. Carrot Top waited for her obediently, raising one leg, making a stepping motion.</p>
<p>Brother Felix led them through the pasture. He walked backwards in front of them, swinging his arms, so that they wouldn't mess up their steps. He first pretended to be the mayor saluting them, then pretended to be the priest blessing them, then pretended to be the congratulatory guests praising them, and finally pretended to be the musician rubbing one stick against another to represent a violin.</p>
<p>He made them walk crisscross.</p>
<p>"Stop!" he said. "Now it's messed up."</p>
<p>He smoothed the flower crown on Mathilde's head and then called them to walk again.</p>
<p>"Ah-yi!" Mathilde cried out in a strange way.</p>
<p>A tendril on the clematis vine hooked her hair. Brother Felix tore it all off for her. Everyone continued walking. "Okay," he said, "Now you're married, you can kiss."</p>
<p>He saw them hesitating and said:</p>
<p>"What! What are you afraid of! Kiss. People should kiss when they get married. Make some flattering gestures and say some words of love. Your faces all look like they're wrapped in lead."</p>
<p>He who was better and perhaps already talked about love, laughed at their clumsiness. He first kissed Mathilde - this was his reward for his hard work - setting an example for them.</p>
<p>Carrot Top mustered his courage and, through the tangled plants, sought Mathilde's face, and he kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>"This isn't a joke," he said. "I will really marry you in the future."</p>
<p>Mathilde also returned a kiss on Carrot Top's cheek. Immediately, clumsy, awkward, both of them blushed.</p>
<p>Brother Felix made fun of them.</p>
<p>"Blushing! Blushing!"</p>
<p>He rubbed two fingers together, stomped his feet, and had a slight mocking smile on his lips. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e260">The Night Soil Master <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>When I read Yu Chengde of the Qing Dynasty saying, "Truly know the city people are cunning, not as good as the country people foolish, the country people regard rice as pearls and jade, the granary officials trample it like mud," I can't help but deeply feel that the life of city people has been superior to that of country people since ancient times, and the country people's cherishing of material resources is far beyond what the profligate city people can compare to. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this?</p>
<p>Little did I know that with the changes in the world and even reaching the current world that advocates people's livelihood, country people who see rice as pearls and firewood as cassia are everywhere, and city people who cherish food and drink, even to the point of shedding blood to protect their rights to night soil, have also been found in Wenzhou.</p>
<p>According to reports, the total annual income from night soil in Wenzhou is more than 200,000 yuan. Now, due to the shortage of educational funds, there is a proposal to nationalize night soil. The citizens, with the overwhelming reason that "the tax donations of the four major elements of democracy have already exceeded twice the original price, and there is no food to eat, so where does the night soil come from," unanimously opposed it, and it even developed into a bloody incident (excerpt from a Wenzhou dispatch from a certain newspaper).</p>
<p>This news, compared to the strange incident in Sichuan where grain taxes have been collected until the 63rd year of the Republic of China, makes me feel that although their methods and designs are different, their intention to kill the goose to get the eggs can be eternally bound by a thousand miles of spiritual communion!</p>
<p>If the donations and taxes paid before, which were so-called "more than twice the original price," were indeed returned to the public and used properly, the small amount of educational expenses would not have fallen under the category of having no source. If it is absolutely necessary to do so, as long as the nationalized night soil is truly used to cover educational expenses, then even if the people fart, they will prepare to publicly create "ammonia," and who would say that it shouldn't be?</p>
<p>"Treating the sore in front of your eyes, cutting out the flesh from your heart," the parties involved repeatedly chant, and they will not know where the tears will come from!</p>
<h3 id="e261">To My Wei <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>My beloved Wei… Since your disappearance on April 30th, I have been in a state of extreme confusion and madness, and endless grief has been tearing at my soul. I haven't had a single night of restful sleep, I haven't cried out in my dreams without a sound, I haven't forgotten you for a single moment. This uncontrollable, intense pain is more than ten thousand times harder for me to bear than the death penalty! You are everything in my life, your disappearance has destroyed my world! I can't live without you! My dear, come back!</p>
<p>For the past few years, our love has been so intimate for so long, so sweet and intense that everyone envied and praised us. We also showed off to all the lovers, our passionate embraces, our mad kisses, our… our vows to die together, our hugging and crying together, our mutual affection, all of this… is my steadfast belief in you. I will never believe that you would resolutely abandon me! I will never believe that you would heartlessly abandon me! Especially at this time when we have encountered misfortune? My dear, come back!</p>
<p>However, all the past joys have now become present sorrows. This heart of mine, this chest that you leaned on when you were shrouded in drowsy sleepiness, you can easily imagine the current grief and despair! But I would rather have the opportunity to open it up to you, so that you can seriously recognize that this is a heart that cannot be abandoned! My heart's desire is that you can find true happiness in the long journey of life, that you will not suffer the slightest bit of sorrow. I am willing to pay for this with all my bleeding and my entire life! Every thread of my thoughts is for you! My dear, come back!</p>
<p>My beloved, you have disappeared after all. More than a month after your disappearance, there is no news. After I asked many friends and lawyers to inquire and investigate everywhere, I know that you have not been implicated or arrested. In my pain, I can't help but think that you have been seduced by good people! Wei! This conjecture may be an insult to you, but now, in order to find out the truth about you, I have to make such a guess with tears of pain. Alas! My tears are pouring out like a tide! My dear, come back.</p>
<p>Wei, even if you have been deceived, I believe it is not your will. I think you had a momentary nervous breakdown. You may have lost your freedom now, because the flowers of sincere and pure love cannot be destroyed by any environment or material things! Please tell me, have you ever met anyone who cares for you as carefully as I do, in any place? How worried I was when you had a little illness! I swear, I love you more than I love my own life. My dear, come back.</p>
<p>There is an unspeakable pain in my heart. Because of your disappearance, I now feel that I have not fulfilled my responsibility for your education. Your momentary confusion, your momentary wavering, is entirely because I have not loved you enough. I hate myself, I will never blame you. If you can come back, I will love you even more in the future. Even if you are insulted by others and are pregnant, I will not blame you, be angry with you. I will still love you even more, giving my entire heart's desire, all the time in my life, to seek your happiness, because you are everything in my life, the whole entrustment of my life! These past thirty days have proved that I cannot leave you for a moment. Without you, I cannot live! These past thirty days! Intense grief has caused me to faint countless times! Wei, I now know that if a mortal has not fulfilled his heart's desire for the one he loves, his pain is worse than death. If you have abandoned me because I have not loved you enough, then how much more tragic is the pain in my heart? My dear, come back!</p>
<p>Alas, all our past, at this time, makes me think of it. I think of our little life, that lovely Lingzi. If she were still alive, she would already be calling you Mom and calling me Dad. She would also make you unable to bear to abandon us! Alas! I think even more about how you have been living your life in the past month or so in such a hot and tormented situation. Has your heart disease worsened? All of this breaks my heart! My beloved wife, you must not be deceived by vanity. That momentary passion is only a momentary impulse. Outsiders cannot be relied on. He will never truly love you. When he gets tired of you, he will abandon you. The vision of this ending is extremely miserable! Have you not thought about it, who has ever truly loved a married woman? It's just that they see you as young now, or they are cheating you into selling it. You don't see the darkness of Shanghai society in the newspapers? When I think of this, my heart is like a knife, I grieve for you, I dare not think about it! My dear, if you continue like this, how can you see your mother? The mother who is always thinking of you, that old and frail mother? My dear, come back!</p>
<p>Since we came together, the arduous journey is worth cherishing, and our everlasting love is worth praising.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Now I only hate myself. The mistake that caused this incident was entirely my own. If I hadn't let you go to work this spring, there would never have been the tragic situation now. It was entirely that bad environment that corrupted you. Alas, my love, let me see you, and from now on I will never let you go to work again. I will exhaust my heart and mind to atone for my past mistakes! My dear, come back!</p>
<p>There is a letter from Beijing asking me to go, but I can't bear to go because I'm waiting for you. Come back soon, let's go together! Ziguang wrote a week ago saying that his mother was going to Shanghai and asked us to go to Nanjing to pick her up. I wrote back saying to have someone send her directly to Shanghai. She should be coming soon. I have already rented two comfortable rooms. You can imagine her disappointment and grief when she comes and doesn't see you! My dearest wife, have pity on your old mother! Have pity on me who is about to die! Hurry back! I will always be yours, you will always be mine. I will always wait for you until I die! For the sake of saving my life, you should ignore everything else and hurry back! You can go to Fifth Sister's house first. Your good tears book, June 8th, (Thank you)</p>
<h3 id="e262">A Scene of Man Eating Man <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon after a sudden rain, it was the most crowded time in front of the Great World. Groups of men, women, old, and young were coming out from inside, and groups of men, women, old, and young were going in from outside. The road was filled with rickshaw pullers pulling empty carts and hoping for business.</p>
<p>"The patrol is coming!" Many rickshaws followed the pullers' legs and ran forward. An old man, dragging his weak legs, fell to the back, frequently looking back at the copper-pot hat pacing along behind him in a panic.</p>
<p>A 1933 Chevrolet car sped from the west, almost colliding with this fleeing rickshaw. Fortunately, it stopped abruptly. The old puller, concerned about the copper-pot hat behind him, let the car pass and continued to run forward, but the pale-faced man in the front of the car, wearing a silk short shirt and pants, suddenly jumped out of the carriage and pulled the rickshaw back with all his might. This strength was truly astonishing. The useless rickshaw puller almost fell backward with the cart.</p>
<p>"Chi ta, chi ta..." A palm extended from the rolled-up silk sleeves, emitting a crisp sound on a dry old face. At the same time, a crisp laugh also came from the depths of the Chevrolet car, but these two kinds of "crispness" seemed discordant.</p>
<p>This laughter was truly a great encouragement to the person with the rolled-up silk sleeves. He became even more valiant, and he twisted the puller's whole body even more fiercely. The puller dodged left and right. At first, he used the rickshaw as a shield, but later even the cart was overturned. Then he was defenseless and lay prostrate, only able to use his arms as protection.</p>
<p>The copper-pot hat arrived at this time. Under the double threat, the rickshaw puller became even more apprehensive. He hurriedly withdrew his hand that was touching the painful spot, stood up from his squatting position, collected his sorrowful face, and revealed his yellow-black teeth like a tame sheep, saying in a low voice, "I didn't do anything wrong..." But the copper-pot hat's attention was finally attracted by the car driver's滔滔 (滔滔: flowery, eloquent) narration. He narrated how this damned rickshaw puller violated the rules and almost frightened his X Mansion's fourth concubine. The copper-pot hat nodded repeatedly, glared fiercely at the rickshaw puller, and then shook out his diary and wrote down the rickshaw's number.</p>
<p>"Ah San, what's the matter?" A voice came from inside the car.</p>
<p>"It's alright, young mistress."</p>
<p>"We have to go, if there's anything, go back to the mansion and talk about it later."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, young mistress!" The silk sleeves triumphantly returned to the car. The surrounding area of the car was already full of onlookers, and their gazes were all focused on the disheveled hair and cherry lips of the person. The car's horn sounded, and the people around slowly dispersed.</p>
<p>The copper-pot hat was "勒勒" (勒勒: a dialectal term for meticulously, painstakingly) prying open the rickshaw's certificate, and the rickshaw puller, with a mourning face, knelt on the ground and begged...</p>
<p>The car driver, Ah San, looked triumphantly at the rickshaw puller kneeling on the ground, turned his head and smiled at his young mistress, and started the car.</p>
<p>See! This is car driver and rickshaw puller, man eating man!</p>

<p>Editor-in-Chief,</p>
<p>I have a difficult matter, please guide me. My parents, several years ago, arranged a marriage for me; the other party is the daughter of a certain Yan from the same village. Now we have both become adults, and we should have been married long ago: but my economic situation is difficult, so we have not yet married. Who knew that in the past few years, she had a relationship with a certain Gong, and now she is several months pregnant. We had heard about this before, but we had no real evidence, so we did not negotiate. On a certain day of the month, Mr. Gong actually hired a lawyer and made a request to my father to cancel the engagement, so that they could fulfill their desire to live together. My father is honest by nature and agreed to let Mr. Gong compensate for the losses and cancel the engagement. Who knew that when the day came to pay the money, Mr. Gong actually insisted on reducing the amount of silver and forced me to write a receipt; my father was furious, and the matter was stopped in the middle. Litigation is bound to be involved in the future. I don't know what the legal point of view on this matter is? Please reply immediately, this please.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Fang Mengwei</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Gong's adultery with the Yan woman is the crime of obstructing the family. Only the Yan woman's parents have the right to sue. Because Mr. Fang is not married to the Yan woman, he cannot exercise his husband's rights. However, since the Yan woman has committed adultery and is pregnant, the conditions for canceling the engagement have been established. Currently, Mr. Fang should file a lawsuit with the court to cancel the engagement based on this point, and he can also demand all the expenses previously used, and in addition, he can demand a sum of consolation money.</p>

<h3 id="e265">The Life of Fifth Wife (Continuation 29) <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>27, Revenge (1)</p>
<p>This day was Minister Su's fifty-third birthday, and Fifth Wife was determined to celebrate it in a lively manner. It is said that some concubines wanted to celebrate the master's birthday in order to gain considerable benefits from the gifts, but Fifth Wife didn't seem to be doing it for that reason; perhaps she didn't care about those things.</p>
<p>Indeed, with a minister's connections, his circle was naturally very wide. Students and subordinates took this opportunity to show respect to their superiors and had to give gifts, and old relatives and distant relatives also had to give gifts in order to curry favor. They gave gifts last year, they give gifts again this year, and they will have to give gifts next year. The minister's birthday comes every year, so everyone has many opportunities to give gifts.</p>
<p>However, since they gave gifts and spent money, it was only right to have a celebratory meal. Therefore, Wu Gui really put in a lot of effort this time. However, according to Fifth Wife's idea, it would be best to eat Western food, which would be more civilized, but Wu Gui stubbornly insisted on using top-quality Cantonese cuisine. In the end, Fifth Wife let Wu Gui have his way, thinking that he had been loyal all his life, so why not give him a little face on this small matter?</p>
<p>Fifth Wife accompanied Minister Su in mingling with the guests, and then invited Manager Gu to come into the bedroom together. They saw He Xiang directing several maids to set up a table of exquisite wine and dishes. Manager Gu couldn't help but laugh loudly, saying, "So, I have to accompany the birthday star here to eat some special delicacies?"</p>
<p>"Of course, how could Minister Gu be treated like an ordinary guest?" Fifth Wife replied with a smile. Minister Su had nothing to say, just laughing all the time.</p>
<p>Tonight, Fifth Wife was truly virtuous. In addition to diligently offering wine, she also placed the most precious dishes in front of Minister Su, but she also treated Manager Gu with the same great hospitality. Of course, she also drank several glasses herself, until the whites of her eyes were filled with red veins. Soon, she stood up and said to the two of them with a solemn smile...</p>
<p>"Originally, today is the old man's birthday, and logically I should let the old man be as happy as possible. However, there is one thing that must be resolved tonight. Fortunately, Minister Gu is not an outsider, so let you two talk about this letter."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took out a letter from her pocket. Su Gengyun was naturally surprised and suspicious, but he immediately took out the letter and read it word by word.</p>
<p>"My dear Willow Silk…</p>
<p>Recently, I have been busy translating the secret documents of the old thief and Gu, and because there are too many of them, I have been busy for several nights in a row. These include the edict of the XX country's special envoy to China, Minister of Political Affairs, and documents from the General Staff Headquarters. The most important of these are the designated military conference plan and the procedures for merging the countries. The documents related to Gu include progress reports, a list of entertainment expenses from the XX country's political affairs office in China, the balance of the old thief's international activity funds stored in the Bank of Taiwan, and rebates on loans for certain items, etc. This list of passbooks totals more than 57 million yuan. Now, my love, it is best to tell the old thief that if he can agree to our conditions, then the old thief's letters and drafts can be returned, but Gu's financial decree and lists, etc., can be used as evidence. My love, if the old thief dares to sell the country, wouldn't he also sell the old thief?</p>
<p>Autumn wind is harsh, take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Yours, Wenbin."</p>
