<p>路透十四日日内瓦電英相麥唐納在此與各國代表晤談後、現考慮　　軍縮公約之細則、麥氏欲在可能範圍内、使此細則廣大完備、具體而非抽象、英方發言人今日聲稱、軍縮會之休會、在目前歐洲情勢中、實屬無益、歐洲刻在退化中云</p>

<p>國民社十四日柏林電法國大使龐賽今日訪問德外長牛賴資、對德國國家社會黨挺進隊佔領蓋爾營房及德國國社黨輔助警察在解除軍備區域之布置二事正式提出抗議、稱此種舉動爲與和約第四十三條抵觸、牛賴特當即拒絶該項抗議、稱蓋爾問題及僱用輔助警察問題、俱不在和約範圍之内、因現在暫時居住蓋爾營房之國社黨挺進隊、十人中僅有一人携帶獵槍及手槍一支、即輔助警察等亦不能即認爲具有軍隊之力量、故此種調動純屬德國内部保持地方治安之事云　　哈瓦斯十四日柏林電法國駐德大使龐賽本日往謁德外長牛賴資、對於希特勒衝鋒隊占據蓋爾地方兵營一事、提出抗議、並謂蓋爾地方事件、與胡明革橋事件相距不久、均係希特勒軍隊所釀成、殊有擾亂法德邦交之危險、關於法理問題以及希特勒軍隊將軍備撤除地帶内之城巿予以佔據、此種舉動、與凡爾賽條約及以後繼續所訂之條約、是否不相衝突一層、龐賽均暫予保留、第謂此次事件、不獨使法國人民爲之震動、並使一切國家均感不安、德外長牛賴資將此抗議予以備案、對此事之不幸、亦不否認、惟謂蓋爾兵營不過暫時佔據、而希特勒衝鋒隊僅十分之一配帶手槍或獵槍、故不可視爲軍隊、且希黨衝鋒隊僅爲一種政治團體、其赴蓋爾不過因時局動搖、特往維持秩序而已云云、法大使與德外長談話時對於私人軍隊編爲警察補助隊、以及此項辦法、是否合於條約等問題、未嘗提及</p>
<p>路透十四日倫敦電英國官塲對於武裝國社黨挺進隊佔領蓋爾·柯洛業·斯貝亞等城巿之意見、以爲此舉係德國對内政策之一部份、若然、則德人之破壞凡爾賽和約中不駐兵區域内不得有過事行動之規定、僅係技術上之問題、並非德國故意爲之也</p>

<p>鎭海斯蔭君來信</p>
<p>貴報創　者顧問欄，使讀者得解决一切疑難問題，每讀答　諸案，深爲欽仰，現在我有一件未决的事，我家有兄弟五人，早已分産，大房有子三人，二房有子四人，三房無子亦無女，本人已死二十年，其　尚在，四房一子，五房二子，三房之妻，自夫死後，迄未招姪承繼據伊對人云，一，恐怕嗣子不肖，更增老來飢寒之苦，二，姪　無優秀傑出之人，若隨便選擇一個，則其餘者難免因妬生恨，因此之故，生前不顧招嗣，將來三房之妻死後，鄉間婦女决無遺囑及正當手續之預備，則承繼就成爲問題，依照吾鄉習慣，譬如大房無子，應由二房了繼，如大房本人喜愛三房之子承繼，名曰愛繼，祗可分給一半財産，而另一半仍須由二房之子承受，現在我要請問的，三房無子，固　四房承繼，惟四房亦僅一子，是否可以一子兼　，抑或理應五房捞遞補，希惠函答覆，</p>
<p>答··在現在社會制度之下而又未脫封建習慣中的中國社會，家庭爲爭産而訴訟，眞是不一而足　足下來信，諄諄以三房無子，不願招姪承繼，恐怕其妻死後，析産之事，成爲問題。據我們看來··一個人的産業他要分給誰就分給誰，他人是不得過問的。即使三房無子，其妻死後，應該由姪輩承繼，那也只有從姪輩多的一房，如二房或大房中，挑選一人爲嗣，也不一定非由四房承繼不可。最後，我們還要奉動一句··俗話道··满『好男不吃分家飯；好女不穿嫁時衣，』意思就是說，承受祖先遺産的，十有八九會因衣食飽暖而墮落；嫁資豐富，娘家有錢的，也不能保着她一輩子不受苦好男兒，好女子都不屑注意此等事　假使足下就是所謂『四房』那我們就勸你不必爲兒子爭這一點不出力的家産，爭得一點家産，不見得是什麽好事；你有力量就霬栽培他讀書，没有力量讓他做工也好，總歸讓讓他自已獨立去創才是爲後人的道理。若果足下就是所謂四房之一子，那更可不必因爲我們着你這樣文通字順，又在公共機關辦事，也應該把眼界放遠點爲什麽只　着家裏一點的財産呢？</p>

<p>曁南勝英海軍</p>
<p>禮讓往來客客氣氣</p>
<p>比賽結果四與一比</p>
<p>西聯足球會昨有兩塲甲组比賽、一爲優游對阿伽爾在棒球塲、零比零和局、一即曁南對英海軍在逸園曁南以四比一勝、逸園之戰、觀者數百人、雙方禮該往來、客客氣氣、表演動作、清晣可喜、曁南健將羅海光、因參加江大籃球　標賽放棄足球、但曁南依蘇佔居上風、攻門機會不少可惜勁道不足、屢被救出、然猶能以四與一之比獲勝也</p>
<p>上半時二比零下午三時、海軍開球先攻、屢逼曁南邊陲、不得逞、曁南幾次進攻得顧風之力、球勢頗盛、但亦不得其門而入、往返許久、江善敬由後方救出阿半直趨前方、將任意球梁樹棠挑送前去、符和萱逼得角球、妙送門前、中鋒顧尚勷用頭迎之、打個正着、卽勝一球、極爲清爽開賽約一刻耳、爲時無幾、邊陲又起風波、鍾勇森帶球進窺、畝前衛糾　不放、卒被鍾在敵脚上帶球出、傅送塲中、球被風吹、幾平出界、張淇藻反鈞門前、守門將球接住尹貴義追至門下、守門情急心慌、竟然失手、球乃入門、曁南遂勝二球、成上半時之結局、</p>
<p>下半時二比一易門再戰、曁南雖處於逆風地位、但球勢依然機盛、海軍門前龍如　虎鬥、險象不脫、曁南先後得攻門機會、不下十餘次、可惜力道不足、均被救出、海軍幾度反攻、亦不得逞、相戰至半小時、時海軍一鼓作氣直搗曁南後方、守衛彼此誤會、被海軍中鋒拉梅特從斜剌裏射中一球、中央開球、曁南亦一鼓而下、乘敵不備、顧尚勸亦中一球、一失一得、相距不满三分鐘、從此海軍氣勢漸衰、衹有招架之力、而少反攻之能、鍾勇梅在邊陲遠球對門射去竟然中的、喜出望外、此球實係守門大意所致沿柱滾入門内、結果曁南遂以四比一勝</p>

<p>梁官濂表演之佳妙、不在周賢言之下、王樹森之老練、錢耀彬之簡潔均較往日可觀、推而至於中衛缐、黃瑞華葉晋棉石金生等防守嚴密、無懈可擊、總之、優游昨日内部諸將、莫不盡職、外鋒五將、獨少表見、其中半數、非貪懶、卽喜多盤、甚則望影見　、不敢勇進、機會頻至、轉成烟雲者職是故耳</p>

<p>阿伽爾满望高奏凱旋、結果遭此意外、懊傷可知、前鋒極盡進展能事、但不易登堂入室、而射擊工夫、又不如往日銳利、加之對方督視甚力、不得自由行動、即以下半局在完全控制對方之下亦難得逞、中衛缐健强、攻守齊能、中堅海氏特佳内部遂得相安無事、是日春風如剪、力挾皮球如走羅盤、令人難以捉摸、阿伽爾雖能任意運用、較常减色也</p>

<p>總算是體恤學校兒童吧，從此以後，學校兒童可以節省一部分記憶力了。只爲兒童最難記憶的是地理上的名詞，尤其　　　　的是每逢考試時關於塞北　東　幾省的地理上問題。現在呢，遼吉黑熱四省的版圖已變换了顏色··小朋友　地理課本時，這四省便可略過了。當然節省了他們一部分的記憶力，值得唤一聲體恤學校兒童。</p>
<p>總算是體恤學生家長吧，從此以後，學生家長可以節省一部分書籍費了　只爲兒童的書籍費、近來有　長增高的趨勢；尤其是圖比着旁的課本加们昻貴。現在呢，遼吉黑熱四省的地圖，讓渡到外國地圖上去了；父兄們替兒童購中華民國地圖，比着舊時地圖可以减少四面，價值當然也减輕了。節省了學生家長的書籍費，值得唤一聲體恤學生家長　不抵抗主義是萬惡的，喪師失地棄職潛逃是萬惡的；然而，萬惡之中，也有二善，就是上文所說的二善。以善抵惡，總算不是萬惡，總算是九千九百九十八惡</p>

<p>緩衝地帶</p>
<p>咱家鄉，新近發生一種『侵佔滴水』的訴訟。張大個兒有一畝三分地在這一畝三分地上，蓋着三開門二廂房的住宅。王小三子，積着幾個血汗錢在張大個兒的貼鄰、買了一方地、爲子孫萬代計，鳩工庀材，也造起了一棣低而且矮的小平房。但是王小三子的矮房屋，却把屋　造到了張大個兒的屋　之下，於是你說我侵佔了滴水，我也說你侵佔了滴水，大家不肯讓步，不得不驚官動府，打一下子官司</p>
<p>照理，張大個兒的房屋，起造在先屋　上的雨水滴下來。滴在自已土地上　本不干人家的事。王小三子的屋　鑽在張大個兒的屋　下，難說佔天不佔地，究竟是把水滴在人家土地上。若王小三子是不講歪理十八條的朋友，早就應當在造屋之先，把屋　縮進一尺，那麽，你的屋　水滴在你的土地上，我的屋　水滴在我的土地上，各滴各的屋　水，誰都不要侵佔誰，就可免了這一番訴訟了。但是王小三子，究是貧兒暴富　蠻不講理，還满想張大個兒把房屋拆卸着讓他</p>
<p>這種『滴水』本是很狹小的一塊土地旣做了貼近的街坊大家都好講一個情面。可是事實告訴我們，現在的人是愛『得寸進尺，』張大個兒若是好說話了王小三子訛賴着張大個兒不袛侵佔了滴水，或許會說張大個兒的房屋，都是造在他的土地上，合你纏擾個不休</p>
<p>日本人在上海和錦州，都曾提說過這種『滴水』性質的『緩衝地帶，』現在聽說又想在北平至長城之間，玩這一套把戲大家注意呀</p>

<p>或者我們在滬戰後參觀過吳淞砲台的人已看到那些砲台殘毁的遺跡。我便從這毁壞的砲台上，聯想到修築砲台人張合才生平的一段笑料。沿着長江海口一帶的砲台。大都在光緒初葉大將張合才一手修築的。這位張將軍是湖南老鄉，皮匠出身，投効行伍之後，累戰立功，統帶一些老湘營，一時　爲驍勇善戰的大將。他先當了一任淮揚鎭毫，後來便陞到福建泉州的提督，他在光緒甲申年榮歸故里，邀宴一班當地的知名之士。於是大家赠了他一塊區額，四個大字便是『甲乙丙丁』。張合才一個武夫，没有什麽文才，便將那塊區高高掛起，自以爲是榮宗耀祖，一門顯貴！	到後來在任上無意中和幕友們談起，那幕友便道··『大帥受欺了，試想大帥是什麽出身？這甲字分明像是一把錐子，這乙字極像一把切皮刀，丙字豈不像裁鞋底的板，丁字簡直是釘鞋的鐵板了一。張合才聽了，大失所望，連夜寄信到家，除去了這一塊區額，因此當時便傅爲笑柄了。</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>國貨年劈頭第一砲，是中國國貨公司開幕，按連第二砲，便是中國國貨公司與參加芝加哥博覽會出品恊會，於今日即在大陸商塲中國國貨公司舉行出口展覽會。萃全國之菁英，集各省之特産，在此車龍馬水之南京路上，公開展覧，其意義之深遠，使命之重大，值得提出以諗邦人；</p>
<p>（一）國貨公司之使命，原不僅在廣銷出品，尤在改進國産，而改進之方法厥在展覽，由展覽而比較，由比較而竸爭，由竸爭而進步，此舉不僅使消費者有所觀感，即生産者亦可藉此舊勉。吾嘗病中國國産，最大缺點，在不求精進，而無對外貿易之眼光，粗製濫造，但求暢銷，便以爲盡其能事結果則的敗者比比。極少肯用緻密由思，精益求精，以制勝外貨，列年對外貿易之失敗，可爲痛心。此次參加芝博會中，福建之漆，宜興之陶江西之瓷，湖南之繡，以及各地國産品，均覺較有大有進步。余歷在南洋勸業會，巴拿馬賽會，中華國貨展覽會，西湖博覽會等研究出品之遞進似以此次最爲用心，可見國人於製造上未始無進步，惜旣無科學方法，又無研究精神，社會上甚少從事督促與鼓勵之機關，以致進步不甚顯著，而國外又少宣傅力量，至爲可惜。今後苟任何國産之製造，能爲此不斷的研究，産業界相與日求改進，則其成就之大，何可計數，此不得不希望於生産界之一致努力也</p>
<p>（二）國人向有一種心理，即不能信仰國貨、而一惟舶來品之是尚，知識階级與資産階級中人尤甚，各日一觀此國貨公司與芝捕會之陳列品及發賣品匠心精製，何嘗遜於外人，或且有過之者。則國人自鄙自餒之風。可以破　除，乘此機會，可以廣事勸導，父詔其子，兄勉其弟，乃至夫婦親戚師友間相勸告，以一致採用國産品爲榮譽，爲美觀，則國産界事業發展，規模日宏，而製造上可以精益求精，日新月異，此次展覽，其有造於國貨界寗有涯涘，此不得不希望於消費者之一致努力。</p>
<p>前日芝博會之展覽，遠在滬西，參觀者極有此，而距離過遠，頗有失之交臂爲憾。今幸在南京略之中國國貨公司舉行，地旣利便，時又適宜，吾知參觀者更形踴躍從事，以不負辦事者之苦心毅力也</p>

<p>— 谷園</p>
<p>上月十六日第六期申報國貨週刋上，拜讀潘仰堯先生的『家庭國貨運動』一文，談到『外貨的銷費，多半是智識份子，受敎育程度　高，推銷外貨愈力可謂慨乎言之，記者就耳目所及，觀察現社會消費外貨的程度，確以智識階级的集團爲最甚。尤其認爲嚴重的，是一般大學學生好用外貨的習慣，所以特别提出談談，希望當事者知所憬悟</p>
<p>上海一埠，大學林立，大學學生，成千成萬，他們依賴祖上的餘蔭，過着優好的生活。貧窮如中國，凡是能享受大學敎育的人，總可以算是智識階級了我們考查智識階級日常消費外貨的能力，要以大學生爲最厲害，這是無可諱言的一件事，大學生足上穿的是皮鞋，頭上用的是司丹康和巴黎生髮水，度幾種東西，過去在我們的關册上，都顯示着龐大的數字。國貨牛皮所做的皮鞋雖然質地稍粗，而堅固耐用，則遠過舶來品；國貨潤髮膏，近年來也有長足的進步，質良價廉，但仍不足當大學生之一顧。至於大學生所穿的衣服，可以說都是來路貨的洋裝；章華毛織廠所出的國貨呢絨，儘管物美價廉，但是被『袛要洋貨，不問其他』的觀念所支配着的大學生們是不歡迎的。大學生中穿中裝的，未始没有，但總是極少數。記者有幾位朋友方從學校畢業後，在社會服務，都熱烈地參加國貨運動，但是他們身上穿的仍是來路貨的洋裝；經記者笑問之下，他們異口同聲地說這是在學校裏所做的，以後决不再做洋貨的洋裝了。即此可見大學生風行洋裝的一斑了。大學生口袋上挿着的自來墨水筆，以前是華脫孟康克令，現在非派克不辦。至於ＫＥＤＳ運勸鞋才　開夏羊毛運動衫，更是十足的來路貨</p>
<p>記者有時赴各大學訪友，目擊大學生所用的東西，什九是外貨，不禁感慨系之！這僅是物質上洋化的表現。講到精神上的洋化，尚有甚於此者··大學生談話，喜夾英語，喧　聲中，『哈囉』『密司脫』『密司』的腔調，洋洋盈耳，一似惟恐洋之不至者。這種怪狀，即在經過大學的電車頭等箱中，也可看到。</p>
<p>分析大學生喜用外貨的原因；第一，外貨精美觀，用時舒適愉快，大學生用慣之後，往往在意購取，不加思慮。第二，大學生一天到晚，把光陰消磨在敎室實騐室和圖畫館裏，和外界很少接觸，對於國弱民貧的病象，尚少認識第三，凡是能進貴族式的大學的子弟，家裏總有幾個錢，大學生荷包充裕外貨價昂，也不在乎</p>
<p>智識階級喜用外貨的惡習，原不限於大學生，但是大學生在智識階級中却佔最多數，同時大學生是我國未來的主人翁。我們想到他們未做主人翁之前已養成消費外貨的惡習，其影響及於國運的前途，何堪設想，即就眼前來說全國的大學生，不下十餘萬，這十餘萬外貨的忠實推銷員，所及於振興國貨前途的影響何等重大，大學生將來居於國民領袖的地位，試問他們自已沽染着消費外貨的惡習，還能希望他們稍存提倡國貨念頭嗎？末流所趨，勢致全國所有的財力，盡被外商吮吸以去。還有大學生在將來的社會上旣然居於領袖的地位，那末在他們領導下的君衆，一定上行下效，洋化成風，財盡國亡，此其厲階</p>
<p>以上所說，完全根據客觀的事實同時我們認清大學生所負使命之重大所以特别提出談談，並無存心指摘的意思，當今年國貨開始之時，我們已經聽到許多方面熱烈擁護的表示，現在讓我們看看居於全國智識階級最上層的大學，將怎樣起來影響贊助吧上我們希望大學校長敎授和敎育家倡導於上，大學生奉行於下，作一次大規模的國貨運動，給這國貨年留些不可磨滅的紀念和成效</p>

<p>國貨之道地與不道地，價錢之便定與不便宜，社會興論上早有適當的評批。用不着『說單方，賣假藥；』更用不着『掛羊頭。賣狗肉』；須加所謂國貨年乃國貨復興事期，那種『自欺欺人』『無而爲有』的假面具，可以用水冼凈。回復本來面目才好　果眞國貨又道地，又便宜自然而然的，會有人來上門照顧否則，縱拿任何吸引力，都吸引不來，這些顧客。總而言之提倡國貨，可以用論語的筆調來作歸納，就是『我之大佳歟？</p>

<p>我們第一步，固然應當集中兵力同赴前缐，但是專靠正式軍隊的力量，未免有限啊　除了正式軍隊　廠家，公司恊會　之外··應當掀起全民族革命的高潮，多多组織義勇軍　各種提倡國貨機關　高唱着『全民族一致起來服用國貨』的口號，一同加入前缐，和敵軍作殊死戰，這才有最後勝利的希望啊　同時敵軍已經抄襲我們的後路，在擾亂後方了，你看；内地大小城巿，那一處没有敵軍　外貨　的旗幟，『宼深矣，可奈何？』我們的主力軍，也應該分些兵力，去和他應付，才能得拯救内地被壓迫的君衆　不然，也是終歸於全缐失敗的啊　還有我們主力軍　工廠　所用的槍砲　機械生産用具　差不多都是敵人的啊　我們的戰爭　一天緊張似一天，就是他們的推銷，一天擴張似一天，那末，勝利還没有得到，又已經失去一個要寒了　還有我們軍隊的符號　國貨的裝潢牠也要設法使　顯然的和敵軍有所區别，好敎羣衆容易辦認敵我的面貌而作同一的進攻，這兩樣也是應當注意的</p>
<p>熱河已經失守了　我們　養的軍隊一槍不發、就白白的送了熱河，要想挽救危亡』還是靠我們民族自覺；如非是用國貨救國軍來抵抗一下才行　國貨救國的衝鋒號，在前缐上吹得越法緊了　司令部，主力軍，義勇軍，全民族大家一致车團結起來　喊著『國貨救國』的口號。一齊衝上前缐去罷</p>

<p>國貨年，國貨年，眨眨眼已過去了四分之一，如果有人要向一切身許國貨事業的諸公發問；究竟幹了些什歷工作？那末在下可以負責代爲答復，中國國貨公司的創設，國貨介紹所總所的新近開幕，已經是諸公先生心血栽植出來的果實了</p>
<p>且不談一個月來中國國貨公司顯著的成績，我們進而一讀貨介紹總所的開幕宣言，記得宣言裏懇懇切切的說『從事研究質的改良，量的增進，價格的均衡，巿塲的情况，』這寥寥一二十字的確指示了今後國貨的救濟和出路一般與國貨介紹所有指臂相連的關係的國貨工廠，應如何急起直追、共負起這重大的擔子</p>
<p>老實說，國貨在眼前，質的一方面可以和舶來較量的實在很少，不是質地簡薄，便是工作草率，這也怪不得同胞們情願化同樣的代價去找『來路貨』了反正，有幾種國貨呢絨的質料花式的確可以和洋貨媲美，美中不足的，是價格太貴了些，像我們這些無産階级很少問津的可能，這是關於廠方减低成本的問題，望他們下一番注意，至於說到量，更是說也可憐，往往一家資金短絀的工廠，有限數的出品，不得不受領一地包銷的壟斷，大廠家也是天天閙缺貨，本虚枝榮的，比比皆是，而且同業竸爭，長年傾軋，像橡膠業，琺瑯業幾年來由三四家增至數十家，價格一天天的降低下來，這都是營業的仇視，太不實惠，根本反研究出品對外發展的責任、忘諸腦後，眞是痛心，</p>
<p>國貨介紹所揭穿了此中弊病，指示了一條眞正的途徑，在宣言裏昭告無遺如果漠然忽略過去，我行我素，那眞是和『提倡國貨』『國貨救國』的口號相矛盾了，應當遵盾宣言結尾所云『同一步代，同一目標，各從本位上努力，』那才是是有效最切實的工作，而且是進向『産銷合作』道上的必經的階梯。</p>
<p>謹叙上面一些管見，質諸諸位國貨界先進，以爲然否？</p>

<h3 id="c196">談談經濟油爐 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 庸</p>
<p>妙在無煤烟無聲響</p>
<p>不用打汽不用火酒</p>
<p>最近巿上新發明一種國貨，呌做『經濟油爐』的，購來試之，的確不錯，所謂經濟』倒也名副其實，因爲他的優點是用的時候，手續簡便，祇須將火柴一引，即能燃着，也不用打汽，也不用火酒，像打汽爐的麻煩，點用火油極省而且劣油更好，據說是利用空中的養汽作爲燃料，所以用火油不分優劣，每小時袛費三兩代價，不過六七十文的油費講到火力，反比任何油爐爲烈，最高的熱度，竟有六百度，欲其微熱，可以自由旋低，無論猛火微火，都没有一些烟煤或聲響，就是全夜燃點，也没有什麽然險，實在是一種經濟家庭必需之品今將該爐的優點和用法模形（見圖）說明如下</p>
<p>優點（一）用油經濟燃燒火油，是利用空氣，所以用油極省，每小時袛費火油三兩，如點微火全夜八小時，亦衹費三四兩火油。（二）手續敏捷，用火柴點火不必打汽，不用火酒，祇須一引便可燃點（三）使用安全，點火之後，即自動將火化汽，所以火光純作青藍色，無烟無煤　　無臭無聲。（四）燃點熱度，高至六百度以上，最低约在百度之間。（五）煑食便利無論圓鍋，平壺，尖底鑊，塘瓷杯，都能安放，（六）可以取煖，冬天在爐上加放熱罩，可代炎爐</p>
<p>用法（一）將油蓋旋開加火油八九分（约一斤）仍舊蓋好，（二）將黑色燈頭拿下燈帶向上旋足用火柴點着，仍將燈頭放還原處，（三）過一分鐘自動化汽，發出青藍色火熖，就可隨意使用，（四）如用文火袛要將燈帶輕輕旋低，火頭自小，（五）用好之後，燈帶向下旋足，火就熄滅　模形見上圖　　注意（一）油壺内火油不可點完，否則要壞燈帶，（二）燈帶不可剪齊，愈毛愈好，容易引火，（三）正在燃燒之時亦可任意加油，不致熄滅（四）熄滅時衹須將燈帶旋低至不能動轉爲度，自然徐徐熄滅，不可吹熄，因爲吹熄有防煤氣發出之故</p>

<p>— 恰怡館主</p>
<p>天下之大，矛盾的事，說不盡說就是要說，恐怕本刋没有這許多寳貴的篇幅來登載，無已，那麽，始且將我平時所聞見的，關於提倡國貨的一點矛盾的怪象，寫出來看看。因爲，我覺得這種矛盾的怪象，不但是提倡國貨前途的障碍，而且是一種劣根性的表現。如果給别國人見了，不知要怎樣的譏笑哩現在姑舉兩倒如下，願國人有則改之無則加勉</p>
<p>某甲，年少英俊，身穿西裝，足登革履，站在講壇之上，口若懸河，滔滔不絶，據一般聽他演說的人說··他在那裏提高喉　，漲紅了臉，原來爲的是勸人提倡國貨，抵制洋貨</p>
<p>甲乙二人，共處一室，東拉西扯上自國家大事，下至社會趣聞，無所不談，後來，談到巿上洋貨充斥，國貨無人顧問，致每年金錢外溢數萬萬，弄得國弱民貧，外侮來臨，彼此欷歔了一回覺得有點苦悶，於是甲從衣袋内，取出香烟盒，打了開來，便先拿了一枝給乙，乙接在手上瞧了瞧，問甲道··『這是什麽牌子？』甲不介意的答道··『這是『茄力克』乙聽了，又向甲的那隻烟盒瞧了瞧，問這··『你隻烟盒在那裏買的？』甲更得意的答道··『是託我一個朋友在外國買來的』乙接着道··『那麽，你有便時，託你請他也代我照樣買一隻怡怡館主按··以上所說，似乎是兩則笑話。但是，我們只要在平時能夠到處留意觀察，像這笙種矛盾的怪象，並非絶無僅有的事啊</p>

<h3 id="c199">國貨發明者傅記關於廣世紡紗機發明者事略 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 沈友石</p>
<p>使人追念的邢廣世先生</p>
<p>在二月十二日的申報上載着··紡紗機發明者邢廣世·得政府明令嘉獎；並飭財部　金一萬元。由此可知政府的奘勵發明人不　餘力。現在我把邢先生的事　介紹一下；</p>
<p>先生字卜五，是江蘇海門人。　　的時候，在上海竸存師範和技術專門學校舉業；平時喜歡　　學。他在十四歲的時候，把木頭製成脚踏車，經過了多次的改良，居然能夠騎了行走。後來仿諸　武侯的木牛流　，造成鐵牛，能夠載了東西行動；　是還要靠　徽的人力，並且遇到道路不平，就傾倒的，很不容易實用於是　而研究地心吸力發動機·用齒輪六十六個，加重力就運行不息，只因爲一斤重力只能發一斤的動力，不能夠特别省力於是志向又改變了；但是已經研究了六年，費了六的苦心，並且把家産枆去了一大半，最後研究紡織機，因爲他容易成功，而且可以救貧苦，如是研究了七年，本質八十錠紗條機和彈納機才告成··但。尚且没有精密哩　先生本來很貧困，十餘年的能夠專心研究，實在因爲夫人倪氏的　能；這時候，貧到極點了，只好停頓。過了一年，得看海門人黃昌鼎的資助，才能夠繼續襲造鐵質七十錠紗條機和彈納機，一年後大功告成；那裏知道裝配將完竣的時候，先生竟不勝窮愁困厄的磨折而去世　那時是民國十八年十月二十日，才四十一歲哩　士八年初，青島某洋行遣姓吳的行員到崇明，　因試騐機器在崇明，　許以士萬金，購買這個機器，先生决然的拒絶。他說『這機器就是爲了没有國人重視而失敗，斷然不肯給外國人。』由此可知先生大無畏的精神　在在流露，眞不愧爲成功人呢</p>
<p>先生一生受着經濟的壓迫，所以他計劃在經濟寛裕的時候就提出專欵，設立一個羣　社，專事　　發明事業；但志未遂而人已去世了</p>
<p>國人其思組　羣　　，一濟類此貧困的發明家麽？</p>
<p>寄萍附誌</p>
<p>邢廣世先生刻苦研究機械，發明廣世紡紗機在吾國工業上，貢獻很大··可惜邢先生不堪經濟的壓迫，及用腦過度而棄世，豈特工程界失一明星而已　兩年前我受黃昌鼎君之囑，曾把這段事實，作有系统的記述，在本報新聞報，時事新報，時報同時發表，深得國人的讚許。那時邢先生已死，否則他生前因未告成功，不主張公開發表的。廣世紡紗機，現由中央研究院工程研究所仿照原理，加以改造，约一年之後，可全部成功，有造於我國紡績業，當非淺鮮。此不但邢君一人之力，即黃昌鼎君及該所人員一番籌劃的苦心，也使人敬佩不置</p>

<h3 id="c221">從正經到幽默 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 五</p>
<p>前幾大有人從『幽默』談到『正經』。我看，也不不　然譬如電車上一人下車，空出一個坐位，給兩個好朋支看見了好友甲請坐</p>
<p>好友乙不客氣，你請坐</p>
<p>旁邊一人，大抵出於誤會，一屁股坐下，實得其，兩人只好紅着臉，暗地呌苦。揖讓謙遜，未嘗不是一本正經，然而結局，却成了幽默的來源。</p>
<p>旁國主義在『國際合作』的美名下來瓜分中國，名正言順，未嘗不是一本正經　然而被瓜分的中國，居然有人打電報說··這是『公正嚴明』歌頌之不足，還要拖出京市七十萬民衆來『敬致慰念之忱』可憐這七十萬人，即使打一個對折，也有三十五萬睡在鼓裏，被别人頂着名姓在那裏討賞</p>
<p>奴隷讚頌主人自然是一本正經，但拉着别着别人冒名頂替的　頭邀賞，眞是幽默之至</p>
<p>要家財萬貫，姬妾盈庭的軍閥們去守土禦侮，本已不近情理，其不想抗也宜矣，然而也居然會發出一本正經的『雖至一槍一彈，亦不願喪失寸土』的電報來，也居然會有人一本正經的相信，掏出腰包來慷慨捐輸，捐輸的結局，是敵兵尚遠，早已捲起裝满了的錢袋，爲『戰略關係，縮短防缐』逃之夭夭。决心抗日的電報是正經，慷慨捐輸也是正經，不抵抗是正經，逃走還是正經，只有電請撤職嚴懲的通電，宣言，决議，纔漸入佳境，走到幽默。然而要没有前年馬占山變節，上海某某團體向他索還捐欵，也還算『正經』，然而要没有創造不抵抗主義的大將電請嚴懲失土的部下，也還算正經。</p>
<p>拿情書向情人索後來買香粉絲襪，這是正經，不料廣州的交際花，却用情書索欵，掃數捐給義勇軍；然而救濟國難，也管不得許多，到底還算正經，只可憐那班『君子好逑』的摩登君子，平日看見救國捐欵就要戚然寡歡，悶悶不樂的　　如今满懷希望的求婚書，却被寳寳愛人先先敲了筆救國金，還不知道美人屬我，還是屬他，眞要憂哉憂哉，輾轉不得呢。然而求婚，乞愛，周公之禮。非不正經，求婚未遂，被敵救國，始稱幽默</p>
<p>所以凡事都是正經在前，而幽默在後，由正經而到幽默。</p>
<p>所以，抗日救國，一本正經的文章，如今也只剩下許多幽默的雜感。</p>
<p>自然，文字『一傾於正經，』就有春至禍臨之危，也是原因的不小『者』之一。</p>
<h3 id="c222">詞的解放 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我想談談詞的解放的故事，這故事和曾某的『專號』絶不相干。曾某送我的『專號』，我不曾看；我又怕曾某答曹聚仁</p>
<p>所謂解放，大概是指形式解放意識解放而言。詞到了北宋中葉，經過一度形式上的解放；蘇軾把詞當作詩之一體不限於樂歌，不喜拘拘裁剪以就聲律牠從樂歌中解放出來了。到了清代，可歌的詞已經成爲過去，詞譜很多散失即有譜，亦板眼不明。常州派的詞固不可歌，浙西派的詞也不可歌，勢之所趨詞即是詩之一體了。北宋初期的詞還是以男女悲哀離合爲唯一題材。自蘇東坡出，詞可以詠史，可以弔古，可以說理，可以談禪，意識上也經過一度解放。南宋詞人辛稼軒，悲將激烈，放恣流動，他所取的題材更是多方面的。清代浙西詞派崇爾雅，斥淫佚，常州詞派以立意爲本，也興宋人的意識相近，現在若說從宋人之多方面題材退而爲五代之專講綺羅薌澤，從宋人之激昻慷慨退而爲五代之『妹妹我愛你』。即謂之解放豈非開倒車以前進？若說把詞當作一種詩體，不拘拘於音律，即謂之解放那又置宋人於何地？</p>
<p>據我所知。這位包過小脚的姑娘，她放脚以來，也曾時髦過一時；後來年老壽終，葬在江南，而今墓木已拱。曾天才即算返魂有願，畢竟枯骨難生。我看還是讓她埋骨地下，不必多事爲上</p>

<p>— 蕭石岩寄自巴黎</p>
<p>（四）巴黎雪夜之愛倫坡</p>
<p>上月二十六日午後九時，巴黎大學文科有一個公開的講演，題目是美國詩人耶卡爾愛倫坡（EdgarAhanPoe）主講者爲巴大文科美國文學敎授塞斯恃爾（Cestre）氏那晚雖下雪，聽講的人還是很多。塞氏一口流利的法國話，聽者不容易辦出他是美國人。他首先略叙坡的身世，坡的傑作，後講到坡給與波特萊爾的影響。最後講到現在法國最著名的詩人梵樂希有些地方也受了坡的好處。講完後，由一位法國太太譯讀幾首坡的傑作。她的聲音非常嘹喨，引起全塲鼓掌。散會已近午夜，聽衆毫不感到疲倦，都誢那晚聽了很满意的講演　坡的身世和被稱爲美國國詩（PoemeNational的『烏鴉』，祖國已有多人介紹，我在這裏毋須重說。所想略微叙述的，便是坡的詩論『文以載道』，這不僅祖國自古有之，歐美何獨不然。這類懲惡揚善的觀念，或是本諸人類的好義心。不過用在極狹意的時候，有碍於人類心靈的發展，往日歐美的批評家，對於一首詩總嘉歡在其中去找宗敎或道德的成分。好像詩單爲宣傅宗敎或閘揚道德而作的。坡笑美國人更不能擺脫這種俗見。他在他所著的『詩的本質』裏提出他對於詩的意見。他把人類的心靈的活動分作三部分。一　智，一趣味，一道德觀念。　智在探尋眞理，道德觀念在完成善趣味在追求美。時最貴重的是情趣，卽是對於美的一種渴慕。詩人在他自身陶醉的那一瞬間能感到那還未被世人理解的最崇高的永恒的事物。可是一個人所有的極陶醉的心境，在生理上，免不了衹是一時的，無論如何不能持續詐久。因此他說最純粹的抒情詩祇是最短的時　而非長時。他　米爾敦的『失樂園』作例，他說最使人感動的地方祇是無數篇短詩連總而成的。其他許多地方，讀下去不免使人生倦。他又說詩，歌頌道德和眞理的時代已經過去了詩應當有牠自身所當走的路徑。坡的議論最富於近代性，所以他給與英法文壇的影響極大有人　坡爲波特萊爾之父，說坡最大的創作不是他的小說，不是他的詩，也不是他的評論而是波特萊爾。不消說，波特萊爾又被稱爲法國近代詩壇之父，由此可以知道坡在近代歐美詩壇上的地位了</p>

<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>於是她將諾勃凱黎放下，走了進來，同他做園地上的工作了。不時走進别的，人們來幫忙起初這使黑女孩子妒忌了；然而她却憎惡着道樣的感覺，不多久，他們的夾來去，她也不以爲意了</p>
<p>一天，她見到一個紅頭髮的愛爾蘭人，在他們種着菜蔬的後園　操作着</p>
<p>『誰放你走進這里來？』她說</p>
<p>『老實說，我自已進來的，』那愛爾蘭人說，『怎麽我進來不得』</p>
<p>『這是那個老绅士的園，』黑女孩子說</p>
<p>『我是社會主義者』那愛爾蘭人說『不許園歸一個什麽人私有。那老子弱得不中用，要人家來給他掘番茹了，從他學掘番茹的時候起，番茹上的事情發現了　許多了</p>
<p>『那你不是進來尋神的？』黑女孩子說</p>
<p>『不是尋神』那愛爾蘭人說。『神如果用得着我，　定會尋我的。我敢說他全不是他所宣揚』</p>
<p>的那樣子。他還不是造的得當的十分的傢伙啦。有追求着他的勞什子在我們　面，有追求着他的勞什子在我們外面；這是的確的，另外只有一個道理是的確的。就是勞什子竭力要向那裏去，定犯着多多的錯誤。我們—你和我—必須盡我們的力給牠尋出路子來，因爲不想别的，只想自已肚子的人很多很多啦。』於是他在兩手上吐了一口唾沫，繼續掘土了。</p>
<p>黑女孩子和老紳士都以爲那愛爾蘭人簡直是組漢；（他的確是粗漢）然而因爲他得用，並且不肯走掉的緣故，他們却竭力敎他優良的習慣，使他將語言改得立雅。但這是什麽辦法也没有的··要說得他相信神是較之還未成就的永久的意志更堅實更满意的一種東西，或者這能夠成就，卽使没有社會主義使那一種成就合理似的容易，並且有希望的話</p>

<p>懷琛先生大鑒··鄙人的記憶力很壞，竟忘記了發見墨翟是印度人的那位先生姓甚名誰，今知道原來是您先生，失敬失敬！拙作『何必解放』一文中，確有『像煞有介事的做了許多考證』一語；但所謂『像煞有介事』云者　係指台端做考證的態度，（而且我還要說台端今茲給　烈文先生之信，也就是同一態度並不是『不負責任，任意議笑』呀！不過先生也許又要拏出考證『墨　國籍一的看家本領來『考證』一下『像煞有介事，』那麽區區是喫勿消的，而且自由談小小篇幅，亦非台端用武之地，所以我就承認了那算是譏笑，先來一固道歉</p>
<p>其次，承示有一墨子學辦』一書，乃台端依顧頡剛古史辦例，搜輯關於墨翟國籍問題正反各文。當下就有一位朋友從破書箱的灰塵堆裏找出這本書來給我看。鄙人循讀再三，不禁大澈大悟；旣爲台端不平，復爲學衛界浩歎。爲什麽要不平呢？因爲當時痛駁台端的各位先生未免有目無珠，不認議台端的重大發見實爲空前絶後之妙論（自然台端之始終堅持自已的發見，不爲羣言所感，—這樣的勇氣，更足欽佩。）爲什麽要浩歎呢？因爲中國學術界旣有了台端的『重大發見，』理合共相鑽研，以台端『考證墨翟國籍』的方法推而廣之，或將先秦諸子的國籍再考證幾個出來，或將世界上政治界學衛界的偉人考證幾個到中國的國籍來，豈不是叔世盛事，萬邦共仰？然而不幸國人淡焉若忘，僅短促之二三年耳，而台端之『發見』已不復有人齒及，甚至台端雖輯有『墨子學辦』一書　而學衛界亦視而不見；這次若不是鄙人偶然神明啓示似的牽涉到了此所謂『墨翟問題』</p>
<p>（不幸我還是忘記了大名），而台端又當仁不讓的專函要求更正及道歉，則台端的絶學豈非白白埋没？所以，鄙人在道歉之後，更是二十四分願意來『更正』並在報上宣傅</p>
<p>復次，一九三○年的『文學週報』上有一位署名『墨翟』的不知何許人，忽然偷了您胡先生『考證墨翟回國籍的方法』，發見了您胡先生也是印度人了；這可把鄙人弄糊塗了！究竟該項發見是否與您胡先生的發見有同等價值？區區不敢妄斷，特趁道歉更正之便，虔誠請敎確是請敎，不是譏笑）</p>
<p>最後，大札謂『如不把我此信登出，那麽我只好出錢在申報上登告白』。鄙人以爲您先生這話稍稍失算。區區不才，倒有一個條陳旣然您先生準備出錢登告白，那麽，當此國難嚴重，航空救國之時，何不把該項告白費移捐航空恊會，並且您先生還可以登高一呼，集腋成裘，來這麽一架『墨翟問題號』飛機，庶幾匡救國難，闡揚絶學，兩得其便。您先生其有意乎？區區不才，願爲義務宣傅。肅此道歉，更正，請敎，獻策，並候</p>
<p>撰安！自由談一投稿人玄謹白。</p>

<h3 id="c262">日本脫退聯盟後對華種種憂慮 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>憂慮熱戰擴至華北</p>
<p>憂慮中國非日擴大</p>
<p>憂慮商業陷於絶境</p>
<p>憂慮聯盟制裁行動</p>
<p>憂慮美俄聯合對日</p>
<p>東京國民新聞九日發表長野朗之論文題爲『聯盟脫退後之日本對華關係的考察』文中所述均甚肯綮、茲迻譯如下以供留心國事者之參考</p>
<p>日本脫退聯盟後之中日關係如何繫乎聯盟自身之行動與熱河戰爭發展之形勢如何而定蓋所謂熱河戰爭者、若僅在熱河而不波及華北、則聯盟必無重大惡影響、然就中國方面現在之情勢而言、戰事究竟波及華北與否、尚難預言、而聯盟對日將採如何方策、亦視戰事之擴大與否將來影響日本對華、關係尤大、</p>
<p>對華關係之範圍頗廣、除中日兩國外、尚有其他列國、今先就中日關係觀察之、查中國自前年萬寳山事件發生以來、不斷的排斥日貨、李頓報告書雖有排日之記載、但聯盟對中國之排日、亦有認爲正當化之趨勢、果日本脫退聯盟、則認排日爲合法之氣勢、必更强烈、况今日中國之排日、已成爲公然之秘密、日本若脫退聯盟、聯盟果採制裁手段乎、苟經濟封鎖不能實行時、則採何等手段乎、日本目前之重大問題、第一爲武器問題、自來日本之製　原料、仰給於中國、近來八幡之原鑛、斷絶大冶方面之供給、改由南洋輸入、故無何等憂慮、然中國對於日本品課高率關稅、以爲防止日本貨之輸入、同時乘日美貿易惡化、中國對美之生絲輸出甚盛、並企圖絲業之合同與品質之改良此爲日本絲業界所受影響者一也、次爲日本脫退聯盟後、戰禍如及於華北方面聯盟當認爲戰爭行爲、此時中日之關係不得不發生變調、其中中日通商條約、因舊條約之期限已满、中國宣言廢棄乎、抑改訂乎、亦爲重大問題、倘單方面廢棄宣言、能否發生效力、亦一欵問、如果在華日人、照無條約國人處理、則由治外法權問題、不免與租界問題相抵觸、而日人之在内地居住者與日僑經營之企業、必受重大打擊、彼時日人勢必集中於海岸主要商港、因此揣測、則日本今後之對華貿易與各　企業、不外乎集中於天津青島上海漢口等商埠而已、但漢口方面、能否保持、尚屬疑問、要之對華關係之惡化依今後之情勢與熱河軍事之波及華北與否、關係甚大、今日中日兩國關係、旣非常惡劣、中日間之經濟關係、將愈陷於窮境、不言而喻、故吾人對於國内産業政策、須有充分的整備、以期他日向中國進出、此爲國人不得不顧慮者二也</p>
<p>至於聯盟方面之動靜、因適逢美國大總統交替時代、美之外交政策尚未判明、加以熱河戰局、尚未波及華北、而日本與聯盟、又未實質的斷絶關係、若熱河之戰局就此停止、則聯盟不論積極消極兩派自不致發生重大行動、蓋因華方抵抗、蔓延平津地方時、列國必認爲正式戰爭、恐引起重大糾葛、若聯盟躊躇旁觀、中國亦必宣言斷絶國交、當此時也、聯盟是否復有具體的方案、未得而知目下中國與日本之直接交涉、似屬不可能、則中日兩國之關係、將成半永久的抗爭、而日本對華貿易、豈不更陷悲境乎、同時列國乘日本事業及貿易之不利、互向極東進出、而日本之貿易地位、尤不堪設想矣</p>
<p>更由國際關係言之、美國與中國、自日俄戰爭後、早已共同對付日本、雖美國今日尚不敢以武力與日抗衡、而美之供給資金與武器於中國、不啻借中國人之手、以殺日本、同時俄國之共産軍、乘中國與日本相爭之隙、向满洲進出、以牽制日本最可注意者、美國羅斯福之就任、其承認蘇俄、爲期不遠、今後美俄兩國、一脈相通、則極東情勢、不免發生新變化、由以上觀之、在此複雜關係之列國、將來對於中國舞台、究竟如何變化實具有興趣值得研究者也</p>

<p>（三）現在三堂界限分清、以致普濟堂經費較爲缺乏、老人受此虐待、經費不足、亦爲原因之一、各縣前張將此項慈善欵産分派、松江縣主張是整個的不能分割、但三堂同爲慈事業、何以不能通盤籌劃耶、自後宜打破三堂界限、另定計劃預算、將普濟堂正名爲養老院、雖不能衣帛食肉、亦須使吃飽着暖、</p>

<h3 id="c285">何以對韓人 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>最近本埠發生一離奇的綁票案，被綁的是一個已入中國籍的韓國獨立黨領袖李春山·綁票的是『矮小之匪』，而且坐有『黑牌汽車』，現事情雖未『大白』但假使我們不是健忘者，當能回想到去歲『一二八』以後法租界的政治綁案很可與這次作一個對照。其意義的重大，决不是毆打一二外國僧人所可比擬，也不止一個千萬富翁被綁的重大，直與我國體攸關</p>
<p>據李氏從法租界遷居到南巿的理由，是爲『預策安全』但不幸的這『預策是一種錯誤，求安全當從强者的壁壘壘裏去找，我們所有的只是『抱歉』。雖然我們對於交戰國的僑民是很能盡心的，這大概是『不擒二毛』的遺意。至於歸化的人民，那！哼，我們自已的人還管不了，在國外的受人欺，在國内的受自已欺又那在乎這一些同祖異宗的『弟兄』</p>
<p>依李氏在韓國的功績，將來也有被稱爲『國父』的希望、但可没有我們的『國父』幸運。總理在倫敦也曾蒙難，！至今還留着一個紀念，但卒得自由，而李氏呢，被绑四五日，至今消息杳然，恐已遠送到千萬里處的牢籠裏去。行事相類，而結果不同，所差的只在上海不是倫敦，而Ｘ某國人的鬼域技倆，却遠勝於满清政府而已</p>
<p>現在事情已經發生，當局的保衛未周，如崗警的稀少等！無可諱言，但此風决不可長，爲歸化人民的安全，爲换救國家的威信計，當局有將此案罪魁於最短期間歸案的必要，至少要告訴我們以一個不能歸案的理由</p>

<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>是一個天氣很好的午後，我正打算和哥哥帶了姪兒容舒去逛大世界因爲那夫哥哥要搬家了，嫂嫂們正在七手八脚地忙着整東西，堆得满屋子黑　　的没用的我們只感到十分的厭煩，而容舒的呌　又足妨礙她們的工作，因此决計去逛大世界，動令一布，容舒的高興自然是在意料之中的。忽然下面的鄰人　着有個女客要看我，於是我應了一聲，拔脚往下跑去，一到樓梯頭，就從黑暗的光缐中望見一個女人，已摸索地跨上樓梯兩格了，我爲要辦别這個客人是誰，爲要預防我的客人在黑暗中跌交的危險，我回頭立刻開亮了電燈，不料從電燈光傅來的那個中年女人的面　還是給我一個不認識，但這個生疏而帶着微笑的面龐，却已安然地到了我的面前，向着我和藹地招呼了；『密司脫馮不認識我了吧？</p>
<p>我拚命地集中我底腦力，仔細地向她的全身打量；蓬勃的頭髮，鵝蛋的臉兒，很高的顴骨，綠色印度緞的旗袍紹興的口音，··這，這，這是誰呢？</p>
<p>『是的，記大不起了　哈哈』</p>
<p>『我是ＳＷ的姊姊　你可忘記那天晚上你到我家裏來過嗎？</p>
<p>『嘎，是了，是了　我的記性眞不好　』我這才想到我們已是立了半嚮了於是馬上在紊亂的箱籠堆裏，放了一條椅子，很抱歉地請他坐下。</p>
<p>次的瞭望，却給她敏捷的目光捉住了就呌了過來抱坐膝上，於是談話轉移到她和容舒之間了，結果·容舒認爲她腕上的手表很美麗，要求　下來玩，我馬上禁止了他，他就爬了下來嗒然地回到裏間去了。</p>
<p>『這個孩子眞聰明眞活潑　可惜我旅途匆匆，不曾買食物來。</p>
<p>談話又移到ＳＷ因爲ＳＷ究是我和這女客人認識的維繫者。</p>
<p>『ＳＷ眞會化錢，開學時帶來的錢早已化完了，倒不如你密司脫馮的節省</p>
<p>ＳＷ是我極好的同學，他是紹興人；半年前的一個晚上，我們在餘姚趕不上火車，我曾經和他到的局長姊夫家裏去過，他的姊姊非常客氣地招待我們。然而在當時煤油燈光下見過的姊姊　在我印象中竟有些模糊了。我心中充满了怠客的慚愧，眞不知說句什麽話才好。</p>
<p>倒是幹練的她先開口了；『弟弟今天我曾去看過他，他的胃病又發了，臥在床上，所以不能和我一同來看你。　回答只是低聲的『是·是·是』我委實想不出什麽話來講。</p>
<p>『我是昨晚從蘇州來的，一早就到吳淞的學校裏去看弟弟，不料他又病倒了，這個人的身體眞不好，遠客異鄉，眞使人掛念得很，密司脫馮你的身體倒像是很好的</p>
<p>我踱着圈子時；從側門窺望等候着的大哥他們，這時候容舒已經來張過好幾次了。大哥知道這女客有作『長談』之意，也就把戴好了的帽子脫下了。</p>
<p>談話靜默了一會，容舒又來作北　我對這意外的謬奬，有些茫然了。</p>
<p>『我是前天從餘姚來滬的，昨天到蘇州，因爲他現在在蘇州做某局長了不料我到了蘇州，他却剛調到杭州去了　我只得在蘇州的旅館裏躭擱了一夜打算於今晨轉滬赴杭，可是』她的話忽然間斷了，我正預備開口動問，她的話又滾出來了</p>
<p>『反正你是我弟弟的老友，說說也不妨；你曉得我的旅囊原是不很充實的，經了這種意外的躭延，竟把錢完全化完了，到了上海我預備到弟弟那裏去拿豈知他也已没有一錢了，你想氣也不氣？』</p>
<p>『是啊，他大概都買了書了，現在的外國書確實眞貴』我替我朋友解釋着。</p>
<p>『這原是　，所以他告訴我你的地址，呌我向你來暫取。到了杭州以後我準馬上寄還你，並且還想寄些給弟弟。』</p>

<h3 id="e1">Defense of Xifengkou: Enemy Forces Retreat, Awaiting Reinforcements <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Matsuda, Motegi, Hiraga, and Other Units Called in as Reinforcements</p>
<p>An Unprecedented, Bloody Battle is About to Begin</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Continue Rampant Attacks</p>
<p>Our Big Sword Units Launch Raids in All Directions</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Outside Dongjiakou Have Been Defeated</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Weifan, Chief of Staff of the 29th Army, and Qin Dechun, Commander-in-Chief, reported to Ping by telegraph on the 14th that the enemy has been severely beaten by our troops for days, and their morale is low. Unless a large number of fresh troops are sent to their aid, they will have no ability to attack again. The enemy attacking our Xifengkou position has been relatively quiet since yesterday to this morning, only using aircraft and bombs to bombard our positions. Our army continues to work as usual and does not care. Their infantry on the front gradually retreated, seemingly in retreat. Our army sent patrols on one side and dispatched troops from both wings to search and reconnoiter to avoid being ambushed by the enemy. The assessment of the enemy's situation is as follows: (1) The enemy has been fiercely resisted by our army and ambushed in the rear. The total number of enemy killed and hacked to death is estimated at five to six thousand. This time, they will retreat to a suitable location and transfer their offensive again after reinforcements arrive. (2) They will use a scheme to lure our army in deep and then attack from both wings. Our army has been put on high alert. (Hui telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Muto, Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, has recently gathered the main force attacking Rehe, including Matsuda, Motegi, and Hiraga's units, and sent them to Xifengkou to assist in the general offensive. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Ping at noon on the 14th that after the main enemy forces were defeated by our army on the 11th and 12th, the enemy is now requesting reinforcements. More than 100 trucks are transporting troops from Pingquan to the front lines. One unit is the Hiraga Brigade of the Japanese 14th Division, totaling more than 4,000 men. The Japanese army at Gubeikou plans to take a defensive posture to transfer troops to launch a fierce attack on our army's defense line. At 7:00 AM on the 14th, an enemy cavalry regiment was discovered at Shili Pu Guan Gongling, ten miles north of Dongjiakou, attempting to raid our positions, but they were repelled head-on by our Li regiment. Zheyuan has dedicated himself to the Party and the country and has long disregarded his own life. If the enemy launches a full-scale attack, we can only fight to the death. There are many wounded soldiers here who urgently need treatment. We hope you can find a way to help quickly. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone call from Zunhua, large enemy units attacked our positions on the 14th with intense artillery fire. Our troops were hidden in trenches, ravines, and mountain streams. At night, we still dispatched big sword units to raid in all directions. At 4:00 PM on the 14th, more than 20 enemy aircraft bombed Qingfengkou, Dongjiakou, and Sanjiazi, with the sound shaking the valleys, but our troops suffered no casualties. A joint force of Mongols and Koreans, about a thousand men, was discovered outside Dongjiakou. At 1:00 AM this morning, they were fiercely attacked head-on by our Dai regiment and completely annihilated, capturing more than 100 people and killing five to six hundred. The rest retreated towards Tumenzi and have been utterly routed. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The fighting outside Xifengkou was fierce from the evening of the 14th to the morning of the 15th. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The bravery and skill of Song Zheyuan's troops are no less than those of the 19th Route Army. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Xifengkou, more than 2,000 enemy cavalry and artillery attacked our Dongjiakou position this morning but were repelled by our troops. The enemy army, which was previously surrounded and severely damaged by Song Zheyuan's troops, lost the entire regiment of puppet troops led by Cheng Guorui and Shao Benliang, and their morale is greatly reduced. The Japanese side is now transferring the entire 8th Division, about 20,000 men, and 40 tanks to gather at Pingquan, planning a large-scale counterattack on Xifengkou. Two divisions of Song's troops have arrived at the front and are waiting in battle. A major battle is expected within days. At 9:00 AM this morning, five Japanese aircraft flew over Xifengkou and Lengkou for reconnaissance. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) (Foreign news) Because the enemy suffered heavy losses in the fierce battle at Xifengkou, they have decided to actively advance into the Pass to disrupt our Pingjin area. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the enemy reinforcements arrived at Xifengkou, they counterattacked again yesterday. Because many of their cannons were destroyed or captured by us, they only attacked with rifles. Song Zheyuan and others personally commanded the front lines, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Ershilipu, Xifengkou, the enemy's left flank was completely destroyed by our army. The enemy's right flank still has a cavalry regiment, two infantry regiments, and 18 cannons, stubbornly resisting. Our army is encircling and attacking them. A large number of enemy reinforcements have arrived from Suizhong, preparing to counterattack. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Xifengkou, our army is still encircling and annihilating the enemy. The majority of the enemy's reinforcements have been advancing from the Pingquan area, and a part of them arrived near Dongjiakou yesterday. A major battle is expected in Xifengkou within days. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Shusheng arrived in Beiping last night from the front lines of Xifengkou. According to him, when he left the front yesterday, there was still occasional contact between the outposts of both sides, but there was no major battle. The majority of the Japanese reinforcements have been arriving from Pingquan. After our army recovered Laopo Mountain, there is still a Japanese headquarters inside the mountain, and our army is still fighting with them. Our defense line is solid, and the situation is very good. Yesterday, six enemy aircraft flew over our Sashuihe defense line and dropped bombs. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The telephone line between Beiping and Xifengkou was suddenly interrupted by a strong wind this afternoon. We are now using radio communication. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed various parties, reporting the battle situation at the front lines for the past few days, and hoped that □□ would launch a simultaneous attack to contain the enemy's rear. Song's troops have blocked the □□ Avenue. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin telegraphed to transfer medical personnel from the rear of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to the north. Zhao Kunshan, the director of the hospital, has arrived in Ping with more than 100 people to carry out rescue work. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the enemy army reinforced a large number of troops and concentrated them at Pingquan. Twenty Japanese aircraft dropped more than 60 bombs over our army's position at Shaheqiao. Last night, 2,000 enemy soldiers attacked our Li Jiusi regiment at Dongjiakou and Fupingjiayu. Our troops rose up to resist, and the enemy failed and retreated. Our army has occupied the three passes along the city. It is expected that there will be continued fierce fighting today and tomorrow. Song gave a speech on the front lines, saying that they would advance without retreat and be ready to die. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the surprise attacks on the enemy's rear by troops towards Xifengkou on the nights of the 10th and 11th, the front also launched a fierce and chaotic attack. The enemy suffered too much damage and realized that our army's spirit of resistance was inviolable. Starting on the night of the 14th, they showed signs of gradual retreat.

<p>(Jinzhou) The Hattori unit outside Xifengkou has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, and each time, it has suffered a large number of casualties. Although the Japanese army's work to attack Rehe is about to come to an end, the current situation cannot be said that Rehe has been completely secured by the Japanese army. If this continues, the Japanese army's sacrifices will be in vain. The Japanese authorities are now monitoring the future of the battle at Xifengkou. If they still cannot overcome Xifengkou, they will resort to a second means. (Daily Allied Telegram on the 14th)</p>

This is truly a major blow to the Japanese invaders after more than a year of invasion. The effectiveness of this operation is all due to our big sword team. The Japanese invaders are terrified and lose their minds at the sight of blades. Some use their command swords or bayonets to resist, but they are mostly hacked down at the shoulders by our big swords. Some even cover their eyes with their hands when they see the swords. We have instructed photographers to go to the battlefield to take pictures, which will be published in newspapers in the future to please the people. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 15th)</p>

<p>The Significance of the American Financial Tide in Economic History</p>
<p>The social system is like the small life of a human being. Human life goes through the stages of birth, growth, aging, sickness, and death. The social system also goes through the three stages of infancy, development, and contradiction, and then comes to an end. Any system in the world, when it reaches a high level of development, will inevitably be full of contradictions and will eventually be unable to sustain itself. What was once thought to benefit society and benefit people's livelihood will eventually become a burden to society and people's livelihood. If we only make a superficial observation of the current phenomenon of this American financial turmoil, it is not difficult to take the return to stability in an instant as an optimistic conclusion. However, if we conduct a systematic study of the entire economic history, we will see that it is a sign of the aging and contradiction of the current system. Let's talk about the reason.</p>
<p>First, the main function of currency is to be a measure of prices. Only when it can be a measure of prices can it be a medium of exchange, and then it can represent the accumulation of wealth. However, the reason why currency can be a measure of prices is because the metal it contains actually represents a certain amount of labor. As the credit system becomes more and more developed, the metal school in monetary science suddenly declines. Paper money and bills can all be used as cash. A round metal currency can be used as ten or one hundred rounds through the credit system. The production of currency does not have to wait for labor, and the quantity of currency is uncontrollable. The value of currency itself rises and falls and is even manipulated by financiers' expansion and contraction policies. What is called the measure of prices is unstable in value, even manipulated by a few people. How can we rely on it to measure prices?</p>
<p>The modern monetary system has its own era value. When the post-capitalist era first emerged, the supply of materials in society felt a lack. The development of resources and the production of materials were the most important tasks at that time. The need for funds increased sharply. At this time, without credit money to help, the progress of material civilization in the past hundred years could not be so rapid. The credit money has made indelible contributions to modern civilization. Since 1923, the inflation of currency in capitalist countries has become more and more serious, and the progress of productivity has become more and more prosperous. The function of credit currency has been greatly successful. However, the seeds of decline have been hidden in the midst of perfection. Since the autumn of 1929, due to excessive expansion of productivity, production has suddenly become surplus, and an unprecedented panic has begun. Financiers have to become cautious and withdraw their investment in the market. However, the result of currency contraction has increased the tide of panic. The currency inflation policy praised by everyone has become the demon that produces panic. The credit money to promote economic prosperity is due to</p>

<p>Enemy Fails to Attack Repeatedly</p>
<p>Our Army Recaptures More Than a Dozen Fortified Towers on the Great Wall at Bandangyu</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Yiyuan Pass, two enemy aircraft flew to reconnoiter at Mao Shi on the 12th, and two more came at Chen Shi, dropping several bombs. Most of the Japanese army coming from the east moved towards Dushan in Lengkou. The enemy at Yiyuan Pass has been attacking since the night of the 12th. After our army counterattacked, on the morning of the 13th, about eight to nine hundred enemies combined with infantry and artillery continued to attack. The enemy was stubborn and attacked repeatedly after being defeated. After a fierce battle lasting more than noon, they were finally repelled. They are currently confronting each other near Sanshen Temple outside the pass. During the fierce battle, the enemy occupied more than a dozen fortified towers on the Great Wall near Bandangyu, about three miles northeast of Yiyuan Pass. Our army fought desperately to drive them away and recaptured them at the same time. Although the enemy and our forces are not large in this battle, the situation is very active. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Qin Island, there was a fierce battle at Yiyuan Pass yesterday. The enemy army was Li Jichun's unit, about five thousand men.

Most of the enemy reinforcements are gathering at Mingshuitangmen and advancing towards Yiyuan Pass. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Proactive, Tough New Diplomatic Approach <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Luo Wengan Goes to Baoding Again to Negotiate</p>
<p>A Decision Can Be Made After Returning to Beijing</p>
<p>Foreign Envoys Concerned About the Safety of Pingjin</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Foreign Minister Luo's trip to the north is purely to negotiate a new diplomatic approach with Jiang. This new approach is not a softened compromise but a proactive and tough one. A decision can be made after Foreign Minister Luo returns to Beijing and consults with the central government. As for Luo's trip to Ping to convey our intentions to the envoys, the rumor that he is negotiating directly with the Japanese is unfounded. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, Foreign Minister Luo needs to consult with Chairman Jiang again due to important official business and is scheduled to go to Baoding from Ping on the 15th and return to Beijing by train from Baoding on the 16th. He originally planned to go to Shanghai to welcome Wang, but he could not go to Shanghai due to time constraints. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Wengan received a telegram from Song Ziwen today, reporting the date of Wang Jingwei's return to China. Luo plans to leave Ping tonight and spend a short time in Baoding, then return to Beijing via the Zheng-Longhai Railway to welcome Wang. Huang Shaoxiong will go to Baoding with Luo to meet with Jiang to discuss important official business. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Excessive development leads to economic decline is a contradictory phenomenon, and financiers who used to raise prices by inflating currency suddenly accelerate the fall of prices by contracting currency, making industrial and commercial loans become bad debts and securities investments become waste paper. Is this not a contradiction within a contradiction?</p>
<p>Second, the financial system was originally derived from the credit system. Its main task is to collect floating capital in society through deposits on the one hand, and to transfer funds to industry and commerce through loans and investments on the other. It persuades people to save consumption and engage in savings by absorbing deposits, and it encourages the development of production by lending. At the beginning of post-capitalism, the middle class still had a lot of hidden capital, and the society still felt a lack of material. It is a commendable achievement to transfer idle and useless funds to productive enterprises, and the society and people's livelihood will benefit from it. However, today, when there is no fear of insufficient production but of surplus, its inherent contradiction suddenly breaks out. Financiers reduce consumers' purchasing power by depositing money on the one hand, and increase producers' productivity by lending money on the other, which is precisely the cause of overproduction and economic panic. In times of industrial depression, savings and investment are both great events, while in times of overproduction, deposits and loans become sins. Any excellent system must be full of contradictions when it reaches the stage of extreme development. This is another proof.</p>
<p>Third, under capitalism, accumulation of wealth leads to wealth for individuals and strength for countries. However, as time goes on, when wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, this few people will suffer because of the decline in the purchasing power of the majority of people. The United States has been the world's largest creditor nation for decades, and its position in receiving gold accounting for the first place in the world is enough to be proud of. However, as a result of the decline in world purchasing power, the economic panic in the United States has become more and more profound. The United Kingdom's abandonment of the gold standard was originally a revolution against the gold of the United States. The particularly high exchange rate of the US dollar has become an obstacle to the export of goods, and the fall in prices and securities is therefore perpetual. Medium and small banks cannot survive due to the devaluation of collateral and securities investments. The collection of gold turns into the harm of gold, and the fable of alchemy is seen in the United States.</p>
<p>The above three contradictions have led to the current American financial turmoil. Although the effect of the remedy has been seen for a while, the main cause has not been removed, and the contradiction remains. The state of aging has been exposed without a doubt, and it is not easy to find a remedy to return to youth.</p>
<p>Luo Wengan talked at noon in Beiping that Wang has returned to China and will arrive in Beijing soon. I decided to return to Beijing on the 15th. The diplomatic policy will not change because the League of Nations report has been finalized. Jiang and I have completely the same opinion. This is why I am responsible for diplomacy, otherwise I will never do it. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Wengan said that I do not want to talk about my diplomatic opinions, because when we speak inside the door, someone outside the door will eavesdrop. The people of the country must understand the painstaking efforts of the authorities. At the moment, diplomatic opinions are unanimous and will not change. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The rumors that we are planning to compromise with Japan and negotiate directly with them are indeed unfounded. Luo Wengan stated to the envoys only that Japan's recent actions have endangered the lives of foreign nationals in North China. If this kind of action continues to develop, the Chinese authorities will not be able to take responsibility. The envoys have various measures to maintain the status quo regarding the security of Pingjin. At the moment, what China and foreign countries are working hard on seems to focus on the situation in Pingjin and how to temporarily maintain a small degree of well-being.

Do not lightly believe the rumors of direct negotiations with Japan and compromises. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

However, after Tang left, he sent a telegram stating that he was not deserting in the face of battle and that there were various unavoidable reasons. Therefore, how Tang should be punished must be decided after a thorough investigation. At present, Tang's whereabouts are extremely secret, and it is particularly difficult to figure out how to start the thorough investigation. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

Zhanhai immediately dispatched the two brigades stationed in Daiyin, Liang Fengzhan and Yao Bingqian, from Linxi towards Weichang to connect with Sun's army, preparing to counterattack the said unit. Our Yao brigade's advance guard and the 56th Regiment of the Yao brigade bravely advanced, repeatedly clashing with the enemy. Eventually, because the Yao brigade had destroyed the mountain roads and key passes, the enemy was unable to advance and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. After the troops from Banzheta are replenished, a vigorous counteroffensive will be launched. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>The League of Nations is Quite Satisfied with the US Reply</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee established by the League of Nations General Assembly to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute convened here this afternoon. The meeting was purely a formality, its sole purpose being to accept the United States' reply regarding its participation in the committee's work. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The recently organized Far East Affairs Advisory Committee of the League of Nations will convene tomorrow to discuss the progress of the Rehe situation. (Guomin Dian [National Telegram] on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Here in Geneva, the US reply is viewed with considerable satisfaction. Official circles believe the United States will participate more fully and effectively than during previous collaborative efforts. Granting Minister Wilson the authority to express opinions at any time and consult with committee members is seen as the maximum extent of participation the US government can permit. Most League of Nations personnel recognize that the United States' statement of reserving independent judgment is merely an idealistic position. Since all international agreements require Senate approval, no resolution can bind the United States. The Advisory Committee will reportedly discuss only the replies from the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the proposed arms embargo, at its meeting tomorrow.

<p>(Washington) The US government has notified the British government that the US President is making every effort to ensure Congress promptly takes the necessary measures to allow the President to prohibit the export of arms to any country. Under Secretary of State Phillips told British Ambassador Lindsay that President Roosevelt would soon strongly urge Congress to grant him the power to prohibit arms exports for application during international conflicts. Roosevelt's request to Congress strengthens the State Department's reply to the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japan's Notification of Withdrawal from the League of Nations <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Said to be Issued on the 24th</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations will be issued on the 24th of this month. When the Japanese government decides to submit the notification of withdrawal, it will simultaneously publish a statement regarding the Japanese government's position. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already completed drafting the statement, the main points of which are as follows: 1. Although the Imperial Government is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, its spirit of respecting peace remains unchanged, and it will continue to cooperate with other nations to jointly promote world peace. 2. The government will appropriately cooperate with the League of Nations' disarmament conferences and other cultural, economic, and peaceful endeavors in the capacity of a non-member state. 3. Regarding "Manchukuo," the government will consistently act according to its belief that it is an independent state, assist its development, and hope that other nations will also treat it with goodwill and assistance, promptly recognizing its independence. 4. The government earnestly desires to quickly restore friendly relations with China and provide friendly assistance in its domestic reorganization. At the same time, it hopes that China will recognize "Manchukuo" and adopt a policy of reorganizing Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo relations. (Dentsu dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>To Replace the Former Anglo-Japanese Alliance</p>
<p>London—Matsuoka, Japan's chief representative to the League of Nations, stated to the press today that American, British, and Japanese politicians should consider negotiating a tripartite treaty to replace the old Anglo-Japanese Alliance. (Guomin Dian [National Telegram] on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo—The Japanese government distributed to the Privy Council's review committee an attached document to the inquiry regarding the League of Nations notification, namely the handling of various matters after the withdrawal notification (excluding mandated territories). The main points are as follows: 1. For the two years after the notification of withdrawal, although having the rights and obligations of a League member, representatives will be absent from the General Assembly and Council, according to custom. 2. There is an obligation to pay the League of Nations' expenses for the two years from the notification of withdrawal until the expiration date. 3. League of Nations staff are appointed by the Secretary-General with the consent of the Council, so the League of Nations has only an employment relationship with that individual, without any direct relationship with their home government. There is no difference because their home country is a League member or non-League member, so Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has no impact on the status of its staff. Therefore, the Japanese government will not interfere in the promotion or demotion of Japanese staff, allowing them freedom, but if there are voluntary resignations, measures will be taken to provide relief. Also, methods of cooperation with various specialized agencies of the League of Nations after the Japanese government's notification of withdrawal: (1) Consider carefully the internal and external subtleties of the situation at the time of withdrawal. While advancing the "Manchurian" policy, adopt a fair attitude towards European, American, and Russian relations, avoiding the occurrence of incidents, while participating sincerely in general peace affairs to alleviate internal and external anxieties. (2) Although not attending the political General Assembly and Council, still participate and cooperate in other peaceful endeavors, unless there is a special change in the situation. (3) In addition, still participate in the Mandates Committee, the International Office of Public Health, the International Air Navigation Committee, the International Hydrographic Bureau, the Straits Committee, the Communications Conference, and the Central Opium Committee. (4) Still participate in the International Economic and Financial Conference. (5) Still participate in the International Labour Conference. (Dentsu dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Gu Mengyu and Chen Gongbo Arrive in Shanghai to Welcome Wang Jingwei <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren Discusses the Current Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu went to Shanghai at Shenke [3-5 PM] on the 15th, and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo went to Shanghai on the night of the 14th, both to welcome Wang Jingwei. Other ministers will go to Shanghai on the evening of the 16th to meet with Wang, after which they will hold a conference in Shanghai to discuss major plans for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Whether Wang Jingwei will come to Nanjing immediately after arriving in Shanghai to resume his position as President of the Executive Yuan will reportedly be decided at this conference. The ministers are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 18th. Tang Youren said that Wang could arrive on the morning of the 17th, and that Wang's anti-Japanese sentiment is very high, in line with his consistent stance in the past, but having been abroad for several months, it is of course necessary for him to first understand the situation within the country. Roughly speaking, the current problems facing China are: (1) Can the League of Nations sanction Japan? The League of Nations is not absolutely incapable of this, but it is conditional, that is, whether sanctioning Japan is beneficial to the League of Nations itself is the standard. The League of Nations will absolutely not sacrifice its own interests to aid China. Under these conditions, what will become of China? After the three northeastern provinces were not recovered, Rehe also fell. When has the League of Nations shown any determination to sanction Japan? (2) Japan's conditions for direct negotiations between China and Japan would likely exclude the issue of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe. However, what our country wants to negotiate is the recovery of lost territories. If the issue of lost territories cannot be negotiated, what else is there to discuss? If the powers sit idly by while Japan invades China, and China and Japan cannot negotiate to recover lost territories, the result will be that within Shanhaiguan, China is invaded by Japan's mad military force, while within Shanhaiguan, it is enveloped by the diplomatic policies of various countries. What goodwill is there to speak of in the entire world? (3) Given the circumstances of the resistance to the Japanese army's attack on Rehe, should a military agreement be signed with the Japanese army in order to preserve the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar within Shanhaiguan, which have not yet been lost? This is tantamount to hoping that the enemy will release their grip when their knife is already at our throat. Regardless of whether signing an agreement is shameful, even if we endure the pain and accept it, how can we guarantee that Japan will not invade again in the future? Furthermore, after our country endures the pain, will it be able to recuperate and train in a state of temporary respite in order to strengthen itself and seize the opportunity to avenge its humiliation? (4) China is an ancient cultured nation with a history of over 5,000 years. Will it definitely not be destroyed by Japan? Having this mindset is a sign of corrupt thinking. (5) Should the military bear considerable responsibility for the failure to resist Japan? This is not the case. The country is the country of the people, and the military only bears responsibility for the front lines. The people of the country cannot abandon their responsibility either.

<p>Europe is Now in Decline - MacDonald Stands Alone to Save Disarmament</p>
<p>Draft Disarmament Convention Published Today</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Geneva, 15th - British Prime Minister MacDonald will present the most complete and extensive plan for the Disarmament Conference tomorrow. This plan is a draft convention, including all forms of disarmament and the results already achieved by the Disarmament Conference, including the security issue. This convention is for a period of five years. As for the meeting between MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it has not yet been determined. It is estimated that the two prime ministers may meet in Rome on Saturday or Sunday.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Geneva, 14th - After meeting with representatives of various countries here, British Prime Minister MacDonald is now considering the details of the Disarmament Convention. MacDonald wants to make these details as broad, complete, concrete, and non-abstract as possible within the realm of possibility. A British spokesman stated today that the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference is actually useless in the current European situation. Europe is currently in decline.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Contents of the Draft Disarmament Convention <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Havas) Geneva, 15th - The British delegation has refused to announce the contents of the draft Disarmament Convention drafted by MacDonald. MacDonald himself has never disclosed his proposed recommendations to anyone, but it is said that the draft convention is quite large, about 40 pages, and all issues related to disarmament are included in it. Regarding the security issue, the Pact of Paris and the declaration of "prohibition of resorting to force" are first included. Rumors that the MacDonald plan includes a section on the British, French, and Italian Treaty are inaccurate. Regarding the limitation and reduction of troop numbers, President Hoover's proposal will be adopted. Regarding war materials, the number of heavy artillery and tanks will be restricted, and military aircraft will be prohibited. As for whether civilian aircraft should be banned or internationalized, it is unknown. The period of validity of the Disarmament Convention will be five years. The British side does not hide the fact that this draft convention will be subject to fierce disputes and will probably require several weeks of discussion.</p>

<p>Major Cities and Industrial Centers</p>
<p>Feared Bombing by US and Russian Air Forces</p>
<p>Araki and Osumi Issue Proclamations to Reassure the People</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - Recently, a nationwide panic has arisen in Japan, as Japan's major cities and manufacturing centers are feared to be flattened by bombs from aircraft. The panic has two causes: first, an article recently published in a certain magazine by a certain US admiral stated that the US air force could attack Japan via the Aleutian Islands, and this article has been translated and published in various Japanese newspapers; second, the Soviet Union has military air stations in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, close to Japan. Therefore, Minister of the Army Araki and Minister of the Navy Osumi have issued proclamations to reassure the people. It is said that as a result of continuous efforts, the fighter planes currently manufactured in Japan, although not superior to those of foreign countries, are already on par. The army and navy have today's air force, which is sufficient to repel any aerial attack. Araki admitted that Japan's aviation knowledge still has regrets, but said that Japanese army soldiers are now receiving full aviation training. In addition, this year's budget has stipulated the organization of a youth aviation corps, in order to instill military aviation knowledge in the youth of the country. In recent months, the Japanese people have cooperated thoroughly with the army authorities in carrying out exercises to resist aerial attacks, so he dares to be sure that even if the enemy can attack from the sky, the Japanese people can also defend themselves on the ground. Minister of the Navy Osumi also mentioned the proposal to establish an aviation department, saying that the Japanese navy's actions on this matter are entirely dependent on the US Navy. After thorough research, the US government has abandoned the idea of establishing a separate aviation department, so the Japanese navy has also decided not to do so.</p>

<p>Hitler Party Stormtroopers Moved</p>
<p>Germany Believes it is Maintaining Domestic Security</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 14th - French Ambassador François-Poncet visited German Foreign Minister Neurath today and formally protested the occupation of the Gelder barracks by the German National Socialist Party Stormtroopers and the deployment of German National Socialist Party auxiliary police in the demilitarized zone, claiming that these actions violated Article 43 of the peace treaty. Neurath immediately rejected the protest, saying that the Gelder issue and the employment of auxiliary police were not within the scope of the treaty, because only one in ten of the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers currently living in the Gelder barracks carries a hunting rifle or a pistol, and even the auxiliary police cannot be regarded as a military force, so this movement is purely a matter of Germany internally maintaining local security. Havas, Berlin, 14th - French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, visited German Foreign Minister Neurath today to protest the occupation of the Gelder barracks by Hitler's Stormtroopers, saying that the Gelder incident was not long after the Homberg Bridge incident, both of which were caused by Hitler's army, posing a danger of disturbing Franco-German relations. Regarding the legal issues, and whether Hitler's army occupying cities in the demilitarized zone conflicts with the Treaty of Versailles and subsequent treaties, François-Poncet temporarily reserved his opinion, saying that this incident not only shocked the French people, but also made all countries feel uneasy. German Foreign Minister Neurath recorded the protest and did not deny the misfortune of this matter, but said that the Gelder barracks were only temporarily occupied, and only one-tenth of Hitler's Stormtroopers were equipped with pistols or hunting rifles, so they could not be regarded as an army. Moreover, Hitler's Stormtroopers are only a political organization, and their trip to Gelder was only to maintain order due to the volatile situation. When the French ambassador spoke with the German Foreign Minister, he did not mention issues such as private armies being incorporated into the auxiliary police and whether this method complies with the treaty.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - British officials believe that the occupation of the cities of Gelder, Cologne, and Speyer by armed National Socialist Party Stormtroopers is part of Germany's domestic policy. If so, then the German violation of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles that there should be no excessive activity in the non-garrisoned area is only a technical issue and not intentionally done by Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e81">He Yingqin Acts as Chairman of the Military Sub-Committee <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Speaks to Employees, Encouraging Them to Work Hard</p>
<p>Significant Personnel Changes in the Military Sub-Committee</p>
<p>Martial Law Headquarters Established, Security Unlikely to Be a Concern</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: After Zhang Xueliang, acting chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, resigned, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has appointed He Yingqin to act in his position. He arrived at the Military Sub-Committee at 10:00 am today (the 12th) to take over the duties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>This morning, He Yingqin, accompanied by Xie Zhongyuan, Liu Chuxiong, Wang Lun, Wang Guozhong, and others, guided by Chiang Po-cheng, took three cars from Jurentang to the Military Sub-Committee on Xi'an Street. A platoon of the garrison troops stood guard at the gate of the Military Sub-Committee, holding military bands to welcome them. The personnel of each department and office in the committee were all lined up in front of the chairman's office. He arrived at the sub-committee at 10:41 am. The standing committee members Wan Fulin and Zhang Zuoxiang had also arrived at the meeting. He then gave a speech to the staff in the courtyard, saying, "Today is the first time I have met with everyone, so I will make a few simple remarks. This committee and the Military Affairs Commission are one system. Because there are many troops stationed in North China, a sub-committee has been specially established to command the various troops. According to the organization of the Military Affairs Commission, the sub-committee is concurrently headed by the chairman. This time, Acting Chairman Zhang has left his post for recuperation due to environmental reasons. I, with the qualifications of Minister of Military Administration and Military Affairs Commission, have been ordered to temporarily take care of the sub-committee's affairs. I hope that everyone will continue to work and serve diligently, just as when Acting Chairman Zhang was in office. Do not be discouraged or lazy because of Zhang's temporary departure. There is very little time today. In the future, regarding the improvement of the army, you can make suggestions to me at any time, and I will adopt them separately." Then Wan Fulin spoke to the staff, saying that because the Deputy Commander is now away on business, everyone must follow the spirit of obeying the Deputy Commander to obey Minister He. At this time of national crisis, colleagues must work harder. After the third section chief Huang Shijing gave the salute command, He and Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Jiang Bocheng, and others entered the chairman's office to read official documents. He telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report the process of taking office and returned to Jurentang at 12:00 to rest.</p>
<p>He then gave a speech to the reporters, saying, "This time, I came north to inspect, but now, because Acting Chairman Zhang has resigned and left Beiping, the affairs here cannot be stopped for a day. I have followed the telegram order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in the name of Minister of Military Administration and Military Affairs Commissioner, to take over everything during Acting Chairman Zhang's absence, so as not to interrupt the duties. As for the organization and personnel of the sub-committee, they will remain the same as before, without any changes, and all affairs will proceed as usual. At this time of national crisis, I am worried and anxious. Although I am physically weak, I can only do my best to fulfill my responsibilities and work hard until Chairman Chiang comes north. In the past, political changes in China have often resulted in the successive changes of all the staff, so there is a saying that a new emperor has new courtiers. I am acting in this position, and the personnel will remain the same, and there will be no changes. As when I was in the Ministry of Military Administration's General Staff Department, I never lightly changed a single person. The Military Sub-Committee is a branch of the Military Affairs Commission, just like a branch store. Although they form two entities, they are actually a whole organization. The Chairman of Hebei Province is still Yu Xuezhong. Even if Wang Shuchang, the commander of the Pingjin Garrison, resigns, I will earnestly persuade him to stay. The security of Pingjin will still be the responsibility of the original chief officials, and there will be no danger. Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, has met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Shijiazhuang. I have not heard whether Feng Yuxiang will go there. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will temporarily reside in Shijiazhuang. When necessary, he may come to Beiping or return to Nanjing, depending on the needs of the situation. The front line of the war is still outside Gubeikou. The Central Army Guan Linzheng Division has arrived at the front line. The Central Government has a complete plan for resisting Japan."</p>
<p>After He took over the duties of the Military Sub-Committee, Ying Zhen, the Director of the Office of the Military Sub-Committee, has decided to resign. He believes that the position of Director of the Office is important and cannot be vacant for a long time, and has internally decided to appoint Chiang Po-cheng, a standing committee member of the Military Sub-Committee, to concurrently hold the position, but Chiang is still modest about this. Zhu Guangmu, the Deputy Director of the Office, has left Beiping with Zhang Xueliang. Chen Qinruo, the Director of the First Section, is acting as the Deputy Director of the Office. Tang Guozhen, the Deputy Director of the Third Section, has resigned, and He has appointed Gao Shengbao Yue to act as his replacement. The Intelligence Office of the Political Committee was abolished by order when Zhang Xueliang returned to Beiping from Dingzhou. All personnel were paid one month's salary. He believes that in this time of emergency, he has decided to set up another intelligence agency within the Military Sub-Committee.</p>
<p>As for the security of the city of Beiping, according to Bao Yulin, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, there is no problem with the security of the city. The rumor that the military and police requisitioned the bedding of residents is false. The Public Security Bureau has strictly ordered the district offices and teams to thoroughly investigate the source of the rumors. If such an incident occurs in the future, residents must hand over the evil-doers who requisition the bedding to the Public Security Bureau to be severely punished according to the law. In addition, because the front line war is in full swing, the order of the rear is extremely important. The Beiping authorities have specially established a Martial Law Headquarters, appointing Wang Shuchang as the Martial Law Commander and Bao Yulin and Shao Wenkai as the Deputy Commanders. Wang Shuchang also issued a proclamation to dispel rumors on the 12th, saying, "The situation is serious, and rumors are spreading everywhere. Inevitably, there will be unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to cause trouble and try to disturb local security. From now on, if anyone is found harboring evil intentions, deliberately destroying or fabricating rumors, inciting the public, and all stray soldiers and vagrants disturbing order, and testing the law with their own bodies, they will be investigated and dealt with by military law. This commander has the responsibility to maintain security. All soldiers and civilians must strictly abide by this and not violate it in the slightest. This is the order." (12th)</p>

<p>Wounded in Five Places During the Battle Outside Gubeikou</p>
<p>Doctors Say He Will Recover in a Week</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Says He Will Still Go to the Front Line to Fight</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Division Commander Guan Linzheng, who fought against the enemy at the front line of Gubeikou, returned wounded on the 11th and is now staying in Xiehe Hospital. Today (the 12th), a reporter visited him and was led into the ward by a doctor. Division Commander Guan nodded with a smile to express his welcome. Although Division Commander Guan's complexion was slightly pale, his spirit was very good. After the reporter expressed his condolences, the doctor came to change his dressing, so he took the opportunity to observe his injuries and learned that Division Commander Guan had been injured in five places: one on the right chest, one on the left hand, one on the left thigh, and two on the right shin, all wounded by shrapnel. When changing the dressing, it was a bloody mess. The doctor predicted that the medicine would sting a little, but Division Commander Guan continued to talk and laugh during the medication, not thinking it was bitter. After the wrapping was completed, the reporter asked the doctor about the diagnosis. The doctor said that although there were many injuries, only one on the chest was serious. Fortunately, it did not injure the lungs. As long as the shrapnel is removed, there will be no worries. Fearing that it would fester, surgery is planned this afternoon or tomorrow morning to remove the shrapnel, and he will recover in about a week, because Mr. Guan's strong body is still sufficient to resist this injury. According to Division Commander Guan, "On the 26th of last month, I was ordered to kill the enemy. I arrived in Beijing that night and set off on the 28th. The entire division rejoiced and was excited. On the 4th of this month, we concentrated in Tongzhou and went to the front line of Gubeikou to reinforce the right flank. As soon as we arrived at the defensive area, we were only one or two li away from the enemy's front line. As soon as the war started, I led another regiment to occupy Longer Town to cover the right flank. Then we fought a fierce battle with the enemy. Our army used its strength to fight bravely. By evening, our army had recovered several small areas. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. At dawn on the 11th, the enemy attacked the right flank again with more than 10,000 people, and 21 airplanes dropped bombs fiercely. The artillery fire was even denser than rain. Our defense facilities were lacking. At 8 o'clock, two-thirds of our loyal and brave soldiers were killed or wounded, so they braved the bullets and artillery fire to fight the enemy in close combat. I then led a regiment to attack, and the enemy was defeated at first. At about 1 p.m., the enemy advanced to our first line of defense. Our regimental commander, Wu Yunbo, was killed at this time. At that time, the two armies were only a dozen paces away, so they fought hand-to-hand with grenades and bayonets. The sounds of killing shook the sky, and the blood shone in the eyes. The tragedy was so tragic that even ghosts and gods wept. I was hit by three bullets in a row and was finally wounded, but fortunately the soldiers obeyed orders. In past battles, they often took care of their own injuries and deaths, but now they went straight ahead without looking back. They were determined to sacrifice themselves, and both superiors and subordinates had the same idea. Therefore, although I was injured, it did not affect the position at all. Our position is still the same. If I recover in a week, I will still go to the front line to fight."</p>
<p>Division Commander Guan is from Shaanxi County and is now 28 years old. He graduated from the first class of Huangpu Military Academy and is a classmate of Division Commander Huang Jie, who is currently at the front line. Division Commander Guan also smiled and said to the reporter, "Why are there condolences for this minor injury? Moreover, the soldiers understand the great righteousness of defending against insults with spears. What is there to say about death? Injury is not worth mentioning. Although the enemy's weapons are very sophisticated, they are not as good as our soldiers in spirit and blood. As long as the people of the country continue to work hard, then recovering the lost land and striving for national freedom, in my opinion, is definitely possible." His words were extremely excited. Then the reporter bid farewell. Minister He happened to come to the hospital to express condolences to Division Commander Guan and expressed his encouragement to kill the enemy (12th).</p>

<p>At about 6 p.m. on the 14th, a fire broke out in the rear warehouse of Tongchangyi South Goods Store in Nandajie. At that time, a strong southeast wind was blowing, causing the fire to be out of control. Upon hearing the alarm, the fire brigades in various districts rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It took two hours to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that many warehouses were burned down, with a loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>A Large Batch of Red Pills Seized</p>
<p>Xu Bingsheng and Chen Jinhe, two people who have been selling red pills for a long time, hired a boat a few days ago and loaded 270,000 red pills. They sailed past Gaochang'an at dusk and docked. The villagers there saw that their behavior was suspicious, so several strong men boarded the boat to inquire. The boatman saw that the situation was not good, so he gave 70,000 red pills to the villagers as a gift. Afterwards, Chen Jinhe suddenly reported to the local drug investigation office, falsely saying that villagers in Gaochang'an were privately selling red pills and asked them to be arrested quickly. Director Chen signed and dispatched investigator Wang Julin, leading four guards, to rush to the scene. The 70,000 red pills were still placed on the shore. Wang immediately copied them and submitted them to the investigation office for verification, because the criminals who sold pills could not be found.</p>

<p>In order to carry out geodetic surveys, the Land Survey Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters specially dispatched survey personnel, carrying survey instruments, to survey the land in various counties. The survey has now reached the territory of this county, and reconnaissance marks, boundary stones, pile marks, and flags have been erected in various places in this county, all of which are the basis for the survey and shall not be moved or destroyed and must be permanently preserved. The bureau first sent a letter to the county government of this county to inform it and asked it to inform the districts, townships, and towns to protect it properly. After County Magistrate Chen approved the letter, he believed that the survey affairs were important, and all reconnaissance marks and boundary stones were the basis for the application of the survey and must not be moved or destroyed at will, or even slightly prevented. If there are trees that obstruct the area, the surveyors may consider cutting them down. In addition to ordering the local military police and district chiefs to protect them as important official duties, yesterday (15th) a notice was specially issued to inform the villagers that if anyone deliberately destroys the survey items or obstructs official duties, they will be investigated and punished according to the law and will never be tolerated.</p>

<p>The Enemy Army Killed, Wounded, and Captured About 10,000 People</p>
<p>War Booty Worth About 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Our Army Urgently Needs Masks, Trousers, Jackets, Shoes, and Socks</p>
<p>Han Dian and various public groups received a telegram from Zhu Ziqiao in Beiping (title omitted). The original telegram was not detailed enough. According to the personnel sent to Song Zheyuan's troops, they returned from Xifengkou and said that when Song's troops took over the defense of Xifengkou, the Japanese army already had more than 10,000 people, tracking Wan Fulin's troops. Wan's troops retreated to Zunhua before connecting with Song. Therefore, the enemy has attacked the mountain pass and occupied the Great Wall. Commander Song was in a tense situation on the front line, so he ordered the troops to run to Xifengkou from Zunhua, more than 110 li, and arrived in most of the day. Feng Zhi'an's troops were responsible for the front. Feng immediately ordered eight-character slogans to advance without retreating and die without regrets. Another 500 broadsword teams were selected to charge bare-armed and ascend the Great Wall. The enemy has always looked down on the Chinese army and thought it was not worth fighting. Suddenly encountering these extraordinary hard men 500, they were caught off guard, and more than a thousand Japanese soldiers were all killed. Most of these 500 heroes also sacrificed. The tragic and righteous act is enough to sweep away the decadent and shameless atmosphere. At that time, the enemy army densely bombarded with all artillery. Feng's troops left the line for a hundred steps and hid in the secluded mountains. For three hours, the enemy thought that most of our army had been wiped out, so they charged up with infantry. At that time, Song had ordered the troops to return to the original trenches, remain silent, and not fire a single shot. When the enemy approached the trenches dozens of steps away, they suddenly rose up to kill in the smoke and sulfur. They resolved 1,500 Japanese soldiers. The enemy was afraid and thought they were heavenly soldiers, so they all planned to occupy the mountain peaks and escape by the force of the situation. Song's troops detected the enemy's situation, so they ordered Zhao's brigade to exit Panjiekou and Tong's brigade to exit Dongjiekou at night to carry out a night attack, groping and attacking, and immediately attacked the Japanese rear artillery positions. It is estimated that more than 20 artillery pieces have been obtained, and countless other armored vehicles, guns, and items are abandoned all over the mountains and valleys, and they are being checked. The total value is more than 20 million yuan. The Japanese army was trapped and fled east and west. Our broadsword team bravely went straight ahead and searched and killed separately. The remaining enemies have now been resolved. Song's troops adopted the method of truce during the day and night attacks to make the enemy's planes and armored vehicles ineffective. At least a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed every night. Up to now, the total number of prisoners and casualties is about 10,000. It is a victory that has never been seen before. The people in nearby Zunhua expressed great sympathy for Song's troops and gathered to help them, which shows that there is indeed a real anti-Japanese team that does not disturb the people. The people are united against the enemy. We are now continuing to send personnel to carry慰勞品 and widely set up hospitals to rescue wounded soldiers. We hope that all parties will provide practical assistance, so as to make a concerted effort to directly attack Huanglong and recover the lost land. Zhu Qinglan bowed Han</p>

<p>The Newspaper Association also received a telegram from Zhu, saying that the Shanghai Newspaper Association and various newspapers should forward it to the various public groups and compatriots from all walks of life. Since Chengde has fallen, the enemy's momentum has increased. In recent days, they have been attacking the Great Wall passes with all their strength, trying to choke our waist and abdomen and peek into the Central Plains. Fortunately, the generals on the front line have obeyed orders and vowed to resist the enemy to the death. In the battle of Xifengkou, more than 10,000 enemies were wiped out, and countless spoils were seized, worth more than 10 million yuan. The ancient Beikou and Lengkou also fought bloody battles, and the enemy did not succeed. The details can be found in various newspapers. Our fellow soldiers have been fighting hard for ten days, and their clothes are worn and their shoes are worn. In addition to the necessary items, our association will do its best to help at any time. The most urgent need on the front line now is gas masks, trousers, jackets, shoes, and socks. I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will think that the country will perish without a day, and mourn the sacrifices of the soldiers, and do their best to donate to meet the urgent needs and kill the enemy. No matter how much or how little, please do it as soon as possible. Zhu Qinglan, Liaojihei People's Support Association, bowed and deleted</p>

<p>The Board of Directors Was Re-elected at the Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zilin News Reported That the Hey Ming Chamber of Commerce, Organized by Western Merchants in this Port, Held its Annual Meeting at Beike Yangxing Yesterday (14th). Chairman Mike Meijin Delivered a Speech, Briefly Saying That in this Autumn of Extreme Economic Recession, Everyone is Happy to Seek Signs of Future Progress. There are Two Things That I am Happy to Tell You: One is that Finance Minister Song Ziwen was able to solve a difficult problem that could not be achieved by human power, and balance the 21-year budget. The second is the efforts of the authorities in various provinces to build roads. In the face of unprecedented serious incidents, such as the suppression of the Communist army, the Yangtze River flood, the impact of the global economic downturn, and the hostile actions of the Japanese in Manchuria and Shanghai, the government's expenditures were huge and tax revenues were greatly reduced, but it was able to balance the budget. This can be said to be a miracle of financial management. However, although military expenditures have been severely cut, they are still the largest expenditure in the budget, accounting for 45% of the total. This heavy burden is completely unproductive and must be further reduced to a reasonable limit before it can be hoped that there will be surplus funds to supply more useful public undertakings. The Ministry of Finance's plan to reorganize domestic debt has been successfully demonstrated. At present, the market prices of various domestic debts have greatly increased. Although Likin and other domestic trade taxes have been abolished, the transit tax is still an obstacle to domestic trade. The road construction in various provinces is making great progress. We could hardly imagine the progress of today a few years ago, especially the progress in the past year. The authorities in various provinces have achieved such achievements in the most difficult period, which is gratifying. I believe that all of you wish their great plans to succeed everywhere. As for other conditions in China, it can only be said that the place is in a dark period. The Red bandits and other bandits are still not quelled, and national unity has not yet been fully realized. Although there are still signs of progress in many aspects, I sincerely hope that the current difficulties in the north can be resolved as soon as possible, so that various government agencies can have the opportunity to carry out their construction and reorganization plans to seek the welfare of the country. As for the commercial, shipping, and banking conditions in the past year, it can be said that they are in a dark age. The customs' tax report last year can be a clear proof. The average telegraphic transfer selling price in the past year was 1 tael of silver, which is equivalent to 1 shilling 8 pence 875 in British gold and 304 cents in US dollars. In the past, commercial practice used British exchange as a comparison. Since the UK abandoned the gold standard at the end of last year, this practice has been difficult to use. The impact of the global economic downturn was still slight in Shanghai a few months ago, but now we feel its true power. I believe that the most difficult period is undoubtedly ahead of us. However, if the country can maintain peace and the central government can represent the whole country, then I feel that the huge potential power of the market in this port and the extraordinary resilience of the people of this country will enable us to overcome the difficulties and rise from the abyss to the throne. In short, there are many hopes for the future. We must not be discouraged and disappointed. China and the world have repeatedly survived the same difficulties in the past. I firmly believe that the current difficulties can be eliminated at a considerable time. Then they passed the account summary for the past year and re-elected the board of directors. Mike Meijin was re-elected as the chairman, Buersen was appointed as the vice chairman, and Cokes and others were elected as directors. According to the previous Westerners' conferences, there were often many criticisms of Chinese politics. This time, only the two matters of finance and road construction were praised so much, which is also rare.</p>

<p>A few days ago, rumors spread that mines had been laid in the Shantou port, prohibiting shipping and blockading the port. Yesterday morning, a reporter met a Chinese ship owner from Shantou to Shanghai and inquired. According to him, since the Japanese army launched the attack on Rehe, Chen Jitang has attached importance to the coastal defense of the southwest. Chen inspected the garrison in Shantou last Thursday and immediately ordered the Shantou coastal defense to be under martial law. Since that day, only civilian ships and merchant ships are allowed to enter and exit the Shantou port during the day, from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. These ten hours are the opening hours for navigation. After this prescribed time, traffic is prohibited. The prohibited hours are also prescribed to start at 5:00 p.m. and end at 7:00 a.m. the next day. These 14 hours are the prohibited hours for night navigation. Now ships arriving in Shantou mostly enter the port during the day, and mines have not been laid in the port, because ships can still sail freely. If mines are laid, the navy must lead the way.</p>

<p>In Shantou and Guangdong, the boycott of Japanese ships has recently intensified. Not only do workers at the wharves of Shantou and Guangdong refuse to unload cargo from Japanese ships when they arrive, but even sampans and small boats refuse to transport their crew members and passengers. Now, at the Guangzhou port, the section up to Bai'etan requires commercial vessels to use pilots to navigate into the Guangdong harbor. However, Cantonese pilots have unanimously refused to guide Japanese ships, making it impossible for Japanese vessels to enter Guangdong. It is reported that when Japanese ships arrive in Guangdong, their owners follow foreign vessels into the port and hire Taiwanese workers to load and unload goods.</p>

<p>Ministers and Officials Will Come to Shanghai to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, returned from Germany after recovering from his illness. He arrived in Hong Kong on the French mail ship "Aramis" the day before yesterday, and is now en route to Shanghai. Accompanying him are his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, as well as the Vice Minister of Railways, Zeng Zhongming, who went to Hong Kong to welcome him. Also with him are Secretary Chen Suichu, Chen Yunwen, Li Haoju, Doctor Noel, Doctor Hua, and Luo Guanglin, and Wang's daughter, a total of eight people. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning, but due to rough seas offshore yesterday, it will be delayed until approximately 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. All ministers and officials of the Executive Yuan, except for Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, who came to Shanghai yesterday morning, will leave Nanjing this morning or tonight to prepare for the welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Forty-Two Labor Unions Support Wang Jingwei's Declaration <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Willing to Return to Nanjing to Organize a Sound Central Government</p>
<p>Willing to Undertake Difficult and Important Tasks to Seek a Path for the Entire Nation</p>
<p>Shanghai's labor unions, in welcoming Mr. Wang Jingwei's return to Nanjing to preside over the central government, issued a letter to the people of the country, saying, "Fellow citizens, dear fellow citizens, since the 'September 18th Incident,' the brutal actions and insidious methods of Japanese imperialists have made us very clear. In fact, they have invaded our Northeast, disturbed our Southeast, and in the 'January 28th' battle, we directly felt the massacre of our residents, the burning of our houses, the rape of our women, the destruction of our markets, the dropping of bombs, the circling of iron birds, the patrolling of warships, and the aiming of cannons. All of this we can never forget for generations. At this time of extreme crisis, some advocate non-resistance, while others are angry at the enemy. Our Mr. Wang Jingwei resolutely took on the heavy task, engaging in strong negotiations on one hand and strict resistance on the other. He persevered with prudence and patience, and eventually, relying on the bravery of the Nineteenth Route Army, he defeated the powerful enemy, and the crisis in the Southeast was averted, and we gained safety. Just when we were concentrating the strength of the entire nation, preparing to send troops to recover the Northeast, Mr. Wang, whom our people were looking up to, fell ill again and traveled overseas, failing to fulfill his aspirations. This has been a matter of great regret for us in recent months. Now, Jehol has once again been 'lost to us,' and the war has spread to outside Gubeikou. The danger in Tianjin and Peking is tied to the survival of the entire nation. If we retreat any further, the map of China will completely change color. The League of Nations is unreliable, as we all know. The only thing we can rely on is ourselves. In other words, resistance is the only way to survive, and non-resistance leads only to destruction. We do not have to blindly believe in military force, but self-defense cannot be achieved without it. This is a fact that must be admitted. The situation is so critical that only by concentrating the strength of the entire nation and the leaders of the party, government, and military can we speak of unity. Without unity, we cannot cope with the situation. Now that the military task is shouldered by Chairman Chiang, who has personally gone north, there is a practical expression of strength. However, politics during the military period is an important issue. We want a person who is loved by the people to take full responsibility. Mr. Wang Jingwei, in our earnest expectation, has returned to the country despite his illness. Perhaps a new life for China is about to begin. A long-dormant excitement immediately makes us feel the light in the future. We should be grateful to Mr. Wang for his 'shared national crisis' spirit of fearlessness. We sincerely support Mr. Wang in returning to Nanjing despite his illness to organize a sound central government. Although Mr. Wang's health may not be fully restored, in the face of national crisis, personal illness is not as important as a nation at the juncture of survival. We offer this sentiment to our Mr. Wang. At the same time, we deeply hope that the people of the entire nation will rise up and urge Mr. Wang Jingwei to return to Nanjing to undertake difficult and important tasks and seek a path for the entire nation. This is not only what our fellow citizens in Shanghai deeply pray for, but the people of the entire nation should also have the same feeling." - The Seamen's Shanghai Branch Maintenance Association, the Eight District Water and Wood Industry Labor Union, the Eight District Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union, the Fifth District Water and Wood Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Slaughter and Duck Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Jewelry Industry Labor Union, the First District Knitting Industry Labor Union, the Ninth District Cement Industry Labor Union, the First District Transportation Labor Union, the Municipal Newspaper Delivery Industry Labor Union, the First District Cleaning Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Red and White Woodworking Industry Labor Union, the Dongjiadu Ferry Labor Union, the Shanghai Second and Third Yarn Factory Labor Union, the First District Water and Wood Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Umbrella Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Ink Making Industry Labor Union, the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union, the Hudong Yarn Factory Labor Union Federation, the Timber Transportation Industry Labor Union, the Municipal Stalk Slicing Industry Labor Union, and 42 other labor unions.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Mr. Wu's Speech <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>General Team Leader Mr. Wu Tiecheng first stood up and gave a speech, saying, "The purpose of the Chinese Aviation Association's solicitation is 2 million yuan. It started on the first of this month and will last until the end of next month. The solicitation team has been working for half a month, but due to various preparations, it has been quite a process. Therefore, the actual work has only been about ten days. Despite being busy, everyone has worked hard to solicit donations and has achieved today's results, which is very gratifying. The fate of China now depends entirely on national defense, and today's national defense relies primarily on the air force. Therefore, raising funds to build the air force is essential. Shanghai is the center of the nation's economy, public opinion, and culture. The attention of the people of the country is focused on this city. However, Chinese people tend to engage in everything with impulse and excitement. However, temporary impulse cannot last. I hope everyone will work diligently and set an example for the whole country. The success or failure of this city's solicitation is greatly related to the establishment of national defense. This time, after the defeat at Rehe, the enemy army advanced towards the Great Wall. People are often discouraged by military setbacks. I believe that the closer the enemy is, the harder we should work. The destiny of our country depends on this. The results of this report are still good. I hope the next one will be even more satisfactory." Mr. Wu further reported that after the call for national salvation through aviation, many children across the country sent letters with their candy money to buy children's planes. However, the amount is too small to hope for success. I hope parents and older brothers will encourage their children to save food and donate generously to achieve the goal of children's planes.</p>

<p>Various Circles Hold Farewell Banquets</p>
<p>Xu Zihe, Commander of the Fourth Army of the Heilongjiang Army, Cheng Yahe, Deputy Commander, Xu Qingshan, Garrison Commander, and others, arrived in Shanghai via Vladivostok and have been here for a week. Due to military affairs in Heilongjiang, they cannot be away from their duties for long and will depart north tomorrow. Various circles in Shanghai specially hosted banquets to bid them farewell. Details are as follows: Farewell Representatives: Various circles in Shanghai, in honor of the Heilongjiang anti-Japanese generals Xu Zihe and his wife, Cheng Yafeng, Xu Qingshan, and others, who are about to return north, specially hosted a farewell banquet at the Gongdelin Vegetable Restaurant on Parker Road yesterday morning. More than 50 people attended, including Wu Huanzhang, representative of Ma Zhanshan, as well as Huang Jingwan, Tan Bozhi, Feng Shaoshan, Xu Tongcong, Liu Renhang, Wu Lianghan, Qin Shaocheng, Xu Kecheng, Lang Jingshan, Ms. Bai Jingru (Huang's wife), and reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>Speeches by Huang and Wu: During the banquet, the host Huang Jingwan introduced the two army commanders, Xu Zihe and Cheng Yafeng, and reported the significance of the farewell, saying, "Today, we are hosting the true anti-Japanese heroes of Heilongjiang, who bravely kill the enemy, valiantly resist Japan, and selflessly defend the country. They are not like those who just spread slogans. The subordinates of the two army commanders, Xu and Cheng, number tens of thousands and are still stubbornly resisting in [missing text]. I hope that the patriotic compatriots in the rear will do their best to provide supplies and ammunition so that they can fiercely kill the powerful enemy." Next, Wu Lianghan gave a speech, saying, "The two army commanders are fighting hard on the front lines, while we are living comfortably in the concession. I personally propose that we retain them for three days and have various groups hold a grand farewell meeting to set an example for those who shrink back and do not resist." Finally, everyone raised a glass of tea to symbolize drinking the blood of the enemy.</p>
<p>Wu Huanzhang's Words: Next, Wu Huanzhang, representative of Ma Zhanshan, gave a speech, saying, "Today, Mr. Huang Jingwan initiated the farewell banquet for the two army commanders, Xu and Cheng, who are fighting hard in Heilongjiang. We know that they are the real anti-Japanese people. We hope that all circles will have fair criticism. I would like to report that General Ma Zhanshan is about to return. The generals are currently arranging things in the original place to prepare for a counterattack."</p>
<p>Cheng Yafeng's Talk: Next, Deputy Commander Cheng Yafeng said, "We came to Shanghai to pay our respects to everyone, but we did not have enough time to pay our respects to each of you, and we feel very sorry. Our work is not great. We must know the current situation of the Heilongjiang Volunteer Army. After the loss of Shenyang, there was no resistance for a long time. Later, General Ma Xiufang suddenly resisted. We think that the entire China cannot defend itself, but the small Heilongjiang is actually dealing with the Japanese. The provincial government was established in Hailun. We are willing to assist Chairman Ma and work on the front lines. Chairman Ma's position is also very difficult because Heilongjiang was also in the hands of the Japanese at that time, and the surveillance was very strict. He was not allowed to organize volunteer armies, otherwise the puppet state would disarm him. Therefore, Chairman Ma pretended to be accommodating to the Japanese while secretly investigating the powerful army in order to rise again. I (Cheng referring to himself) was unable to organize the volunteer army, so I went to other places to carry out activities and contact various troops. At that time, the Japanese side paid close attention, and the officials under the command of the puppet state opposed me and detained many followers, but most of them have now been released. When General Ma formally resisted, many people responded. We fought all the way to Nenjiang. The Japanese army attacked fiercely. Army Commander Xu injured both arms and lost his support. We still fought hard without retreating. After the Heilongjiang government was taken away by the Japanese army, the volunteer armies of all roads retreated, and the Fourth Army became an isolated army. The Japanese constantly sent people to persuade us to surrender. I told my subordinates that we would rather die than be humiliated. At that time, we were surrounded on all sides and it was very tight. I pretended to say to the Japanese commander, 'Now the encirclement is very tight, even if we surrender, there should be an opportunity to reorganize.' The Japanese army agreed to retreat a few miles and set a deadline of four weeks. I immediately led the team to retreat to the nearby mountains, collect supplies, and prepare for a counterattack. The local people transported supplies generously, but the amount of donations from various parties was very small. We have a total of 30,000 people. In the past year, we have only received 10,000 yuan in donations, so we can only defeat the Japanese to get bullets and food. Most of our soldiers wear straw shoes and thin clothes. Fortunately, the weather is still good in Nenjiang, otherwise at least two-thirds of the people will freeze to death. This time we came from Harbin. Along the way, the puppet state sent many military police to arrest us with pictures."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Factory Inspection Association Convened a Meeting of Industrial and Commercial Organizations Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>To Fight for the Right to Inspect Factories in the Special Zone</p>
<p>And Decided to Convene a Meeting of the Industrial Circle Today for Consultation</p>
<p>The China Factory Inspection Association, in response to the Special Zone authorities' attempt to infringe on the right to inspect factories, invited the press to issue a declaration. Considering that this matter is of great importance to national sovereignty and the interests of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, they invited various industrial and commercial organizations in the city to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM yesterday to consult on countermeasures. The attendees included Tian Heqing, Yu Gangfu, Liu Guangyu, Li Shude, Shen Binglun, Lu Zhimin, and others from the Inspection Association, as well as representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the United Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, the Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, and various factory trade associations, totaling more than a dozen organizations. Tian Heqing, director of the Inspection Association, reported the purpose of the meeting and the details of the Special Zone authorities' illegal and unauthorized actions. Upon hearing this, the representatives expressed their deep indignation and successively voiced their opinions, many of which were impassioned. A discussion then began, and the following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) The six organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, the United Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, the China Factories Association, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, and the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories, will jointly convene a temporary expanded meeting of various factories in the city within a few days to resolutely fight back and seek effective countermeasures to support the government, until around 5:00 PM before dispersing. As for the Factory Inspection Association, it will convene the entire industrial circle of the city at the same location today to discuss concrete measures.</p>

<p>Possible to Recapture Chengde Due to Incomplete Japanese Military Deployment</p>
<p>Northeast Spring Thaw; Expedite the Mobilization of Volunteer Armies</p>
<p>Zang Qifang, the former Mayor of Tianjin and current Executive Director of the Northeast Association, told a "New Voice News Agency" reporter yesterday morning that the Northeast Association is currently engaged in contacting various groups to urge the armies in North China to counterattack and mobilize volunteer armies within the three northeastern provinces. Seeking members and organizing branches is still in the preparatory stage.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Urging a Counteroffensive <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the battles at various passes of the Great Wall have been fierce. Although the government has expressed its determination to resist, we must not be satisfied with just resistance; we must strive for a counteroffensive to be effective. According to Zang's observation, the Japanese military deployment in Rehe Province is not yet fully in place. If our army strives for a counteroffensive and recaptures Chengde, it is entirely possible because Sun Dianying's troops and volunteer armies are still in the northern part of Chengde. If Chengde is retaken in one fell swoop, it will have a significant impact on international diplomatic relations and the nation's anti-Japanese fervor and support for the government. Therefore, the Association is now contacting various groups in Shanghai to unanimously urge the government to launch a counteroffensive as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There are more than two hundred thousand volunteer army members hiding within the three northeastern provinces. In recent days, North Manchuria has already experienced a spring thaw, and the roads are muddy, making it very difficult for the Japanese army to transport artillery and equipment, which is more convenient for combat. In order to restrain the Japanese army invading Rehe and recover lost territories, we must rely on the mobilization of volunteer armies inside the three provinces.</p>

<p>Regarding the organization of a rescue team by the National Shanghai Medical College, it is reported that the team is led by Dean Yan Fuqing, and the entire team consists of more than twenty faculty, students, and staff, creating an imposing presence. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the entire faculty, staff, and students held a welcome rally in the college's auditorium, presided over by Academic Affairs Director Zhu Hengbi, who delivered a farewell speech filled with encouragement. Subsequently, Lan Hua, a representative of the faculty, and Su Delong, a representative of the students, gave successive speeches, expressing sentiments such as going to the front to engage in practical national salvation actions, and entrusting the care of elderly mothers and wives to those who remain behind. They also expressed that after the team's departure, those remaining would organize a reserve team, hoping to replace them in Shenyang in a few months, etc. The speeches were passionate and moving. After the speeches, tea and refreshments were served, and a photograph was taken before the group dispersed. The entire team set off this morning under the lingering moon of dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Impeachment Case of Zheng and Yang to be Handled by the Supreme Court <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Designating the Jiangning District Prosecutor's Office to Conduct Investigation</p>
<p>If They Fail to Appear Again, Prosecution Will be Initiated</p>
<p>Since Zheng Yuxiu, the former President of the Shanghai Local Court, and Yang Zhaoyun, the President of the Shanghai District Court, were impeached by the Control Yuan for allegedly embezzling public funds, the judicial authorities have paid close attention to this case. However, outsiders have different opinions regarding the case's procedural details. According to inquiries made by the "New Voice News Agency" reporter stationed in Beijing to various groups, after the case occurred, the Control Yuan transferred it to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for handling. After several consultations, the committee members all believed that the circumstances were serious, and Zheng and others were not only derelict in their duties but also suspected of using their authority to embezzle public funds. If the evidence is conclusive, the matter cannot be concluded with a suspension from office. Therefore, the committee submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan, requesting a ruling. Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng, for the sake of solemnity, and considering that Zheng and others had also served in important judicial positions, carefully considered the matter and decided to hand it over to the Supreme Court for handling. The President of the Supreme Court is also the President of the Judicial Yuan, so Ju Zheng, in his capacity as President of the Supreme Court, designated the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor's Office to conduct the investigation. Since the person involved in the case, Niu Fuchun, is currently employed in the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Prosecutor's Office secretly ordered his arrest to investigate the matter. Although Zheng Yuxiu and others have gone overseas, a secret order for their arrest is also in progress. The Prosecutor's Office has already held one hearing and is preparing to initiate prosecution. In the future, the Supreme Court will need to designate a trial court, which will likely still be the Jiangning District Court; this is just a procedural matter. It is reported that if Zheng and others still refuse to appear in court, prosecution will be initiated directly after the investigation is concluded. It is said that the investigation work is progressing well and is expected to be completed within a month.</p>

<p>Japanese Captain Unfamiliar with Waterway</p>
<p>The Lianxing vessel, belonging to the Zhaoxing Company, loaded with a large quantity of flour, departed yesterday morning from Shanghai to Yantai, Longkou, Dalian, and other ports. The captain, a Japanese named Tsūkawa, sailed the ship. In the afternoon, the vessel arrived at the sea area of Sheshan outside Wusongkou and, as usual, should have navigated outside Sheshan. However, the Japanese captain was unfamiliar with the waterway and took the wrong route, causing the vessel to run aground. For a time, it was impossible to dislodge the ship, and the hull was damaged. An urgent wireless message was sent for help. The coal transport vessel Taiping happened to be passing by and received the wireless distress call. It immediately sailed to the area two nautical miles east of Sheshan to assist in the rescue. At around six o'clock in the afternoon, the Zhaoxing Company also received an urgent telegram from the vessel and has already begun to arrange for a rescue ship. The extent of the damage to the vessel is not yet clear, but it is reported that none of the crew members or sailors were injured.</p>

<p>Madam Yu Fengzhi, the wife of Zhang Xueliang, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai night train the night before last. However, because she could not arrive in Beijing on time, she did not make the trip and instead left Beijing yesterday.

The train departed from Beijing at one o'clock yesterday afternoon. It was originally scheduled to stop at Zhenru, and the train arrived there at around six o'clock. However, due to some reason, she did not disembark. The train then left Zhenru for Shanghai at around seven o'clock and arrived at the North Station, but she still did not disembark.

<h3 id="e130">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the City Government to Correct the Customs Wharfage Dues Rate <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Still Follow the 1931 Tariff</p>
<p>Collect 1%</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the City Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the request, the Sugar Trade Association wrote on the 14th of this month, 'Regarding your association's request to reduce wharfage dues, which was submitted to the City Government four times by this association, we received a reply from the City Government on the 8th of this month, stating: "All submissions have been noted. The wharfage dues rate collected by the Jianghai Customs was determined jointly by all parties. This wharfage due is now designated as a fund for city public bonds, and it is not appropriate to change it arbitrarily. Your request should be denied. You are hereby informed accordingly." The association has received this. We have investigated the agreement between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jianghai Customs Taxation Department regarding the collection of wharfage dues. Article 1 states that it is collected at 1% of the imported goods, according to the 1931 import tariff. Therefore, there is clear basis for the collection rate. However, the Jianghai Customs is currently collecting 4%, and it is not collected according to the 1931 import tariff. This is inconsistent with the original agreement and should be corrected. Although the City Government has designated this wharfage due as a fund for city bonds and it is inconvenient to change it, the discrepancy between the collected amount and the agreement should be corrected. We hereby request your association to submit a request to the City Government to promptly instruct the Jianghai Customs to correct it in order to prevent arbitrary collection and alleviate the difficulties of merchants.' We have investigated the wharfage dues rate collected by the Customs, and it is true, as stated in your government's approval, that it was determined jointly by all parties. However, the agreed rate has already been included in the agreement, which states that it is collected at 1% according to the 1931 import tariff. If the Customs is collecting 4%, it is violating the agreement. The association's request for correction is precisely on this point, which is the same intention as your government's approval that it is inconvenient to change it. Since the wharfage dues agreement stipulates that it is collected at 1% according to the 1931 import tariff, the Customs should not collect less than 1% nor more than 1%. The association is only requesting that the agreement be followed, and it is even more clear that there is no intention to change it arbitrarily. Based on the foregoing, we hereby request your government to review and approve our repeated submissions and correct it in accordance with the agreement, which is for the benefit of the public."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Resolution of Cross-Boundary Telephone Issue Still Uncertain <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei Street Lights Have Been Restored</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the following is the information from the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities regarding the recovery of cross-boundary road telephones and other issues:</p>
<p>Cross-Boundary Telephones: Negotiations on the cross-boundary road telephone issue have been conducted repeatedly, and most of them have been settled. The reason for the delay in resolving the issue is the obstruction of the French Concession authorities. The Bureau had previously sent a letter inquiring about everything, but the French side has not yet given a formal reply. In order to quickly resolve this pending issue, the Bureau recently sent personnel unofficially to urge them, but there was still no result. The previous Beijing telegram stated that the signing was scheduled for yesterday (the 15th), but this is inaccurate. It seems that this case has been stalled indefinitely.</p>
<p>Electricity Supply in West Shanghai: Resolving the issue of electricity supply to cross-boundary roads in West Shanghai is also one of the Bureau's priorities. Although the Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Power Company, the principles have not yet been determined, and the timing of the resolution is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Zhabei Street Lights: The Zhabei street lights were completely destroyed by Japanese artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. After the Japanese troops withdrew, the Bureau immediately began to restore them. After half a year, they have been completely restored to their original state, but newly built roads and more remote areas have not yet been completed.</p>

<p>Casualties Among Passengers</p>
<p>The Japanese Yusen Kaisha's European liner "Fushimi Maru" departed from Shanghai on March 28th, carrying passengers and cargo for Europe, first to Marseilles and then to London. On the 13th of this month, when it arrived in the Indian Ocean at 92 degrees 05 minutes East longitude and 6 degrees North latitude, a fire suddenly broke out in its fourth hold. Before long, the fire broke through the deck from the left side of the fourth hold and soon spread to the fifth hold. The wind at sea was strong, causing the fire to intensify. At one o'clock in the morning on the 14th, the captain gathered all the sailors and crew members to use the ship's special fire extinguishers to try their best to put out the fire. However, according to the captain's report, the fire in the fourth hold was very fierce from the beginning, so it quickly spread to the fifth hold. Some passengers in the hold were burned to death by the fire. Because the ship's hull was severely damaged, the company has ordered it to sail back.</p>

<p>In recent years, labor issues have been extensively studied by scholars around the world because of their important relationship to social and economic stability. The Nanyang Tobacco Factory in Shanghai employs thousands of workers, making it one of the most famous factories in China. The company pays close attention to the issue of worker treatment. Recently, it was heard that the company's General Manager, Jian Yujie, has hired Zhu Maocheng as a labor advisor. Mr. Zhu graduated from the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, served as a secretary to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and served as the Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry. He has represented China at the International Labor Conference twice and has also improved worker treatment at the Commercial Press, with remarkable results. He is not only well-versed in labor issues but also has extensive experience. Mr. Zhu has always had the ambition to serve society and seek happiness for workers, making him the only good mentor in China's labor community today. He recently traveled to Europe and America with Minister Kong Xiangxi and returned to China. At this time of national crisis, labor and management should especially work together harmoniously. The Nanyang Company's decision to hire Mr. Zhu as a labor advisor is to seek ways to cooperate between labor and management. It is believed that those who care about labor-management issues in Shanghai will be pleased to hear this news.</p>

<p>At 10:05 yesterday morning, at the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, just as the slow train for Hangzhou (third and fourth class) was about to depart, passengers in the third and fourth class carriages on the siding suddenly made a commotion, saying that there was a robbery in the carriage and shouting for help. The on-duty railway police officer, Cai Qingquan, hearing the alarm, bravely boarded the train and immediately sounded the police whistle. Police chief Zhang Cun and others also boarded the train one after another and jointly apprehended the robber and took him to the station. According to the robber's confession, his name is Li Guisheng, 32 years old, from Yexian, Shandong. Because he was unemployed, he wanted to go to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to find a living. He had mixed onto the train twice, hoping to take the opportunity to rob passengers of their silver dollars, but he did not have the opportunity to do so. This morning, he mixed into the station again and entered the carriage. He saw a passenger carrying a large bag of silver dollars and, overcome by greed, disregarded everything and grabbed him to rob him. Unexpectedly, before he could snatch the money, the passenger shouted, the police arrived, and he was arrested. It is said that the passenger's name is Zhang Zhuoji, over 50 years old, from Jiading. He is the accountant of the new Datong Chinese Pharmacy on Heping Road in Ximen (West Gate). He was taking the train to Hangzhou this time to purchase materials from a glue factory with several hundred silver dollars. After questioning by the railway police station, he was sent to the local court for questioning with a written report.</p>

<p>Cohabitation with Consent of Biological Mother</p>
<p>A Pair of Lovebirds Arrested by Detectives</p>
<p>Yang Peirong, a local Shanghainese residing at No. 9, Lane 12, Mianjin Lane, Dadongmen, South City, is 23 years old and the younger brother of Yang Peiwu, who is engaged in the real estate business and has a large fortune. Peirong graduated from the Su Yancheng Middle School and transferred to Fudan University in Shanghai. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, it was impossible to live peacefully in South City, so he took refuge with his brother at No. 138 Anshunli, Shanhaiguan Road in the Public Concession. There, he met Wang Suzhen, the adopted daughter of Qian Huang, the second landlord. Suzhen had a beautiful appearance and was in her prime. They fell in love at first sight and formed an unbreakable bond. However, Qian Huang's supervision was very strict, making it difficult for the affair to succeed. Peirong asked his friend Ding Shaowen and others to propose marriage to Suzhen's uncle, Wang Yousheng. The woman's side also asked Chen Jingxian to be the matchmaker. Without obtaining the consent of the adoptive mother, Qian Huang, a betrothal ceremony was held at the Daya Building on Fourth Avenue on November 18th of last year. On the second day of the lunar new year this year, Yang Peirong claimed to be ill and, through the matchmaker Ding Shaowen, negotiated with Suzhen's biological mother, Wang Huang, to welcome Suzhen to Yang's house for cohabitation. However, Qian Huang had no knowledge of this beforehand and only knew that Suzhen had been enticed and hidden by Yang Peirong in October of last year. Feeling extremely unwilling, she entrusted the previous situation to lawyer Dong Yu and requested Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen to order detective team leader Lu Ying and female detective Yao Hongzhen to go to the address to arrest Yang Peirong and Wang Suzhen, the pair of lovebirds, and bring them back to the team. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the main bureau for questioning. It is heard that the plaintiff, Qian Huang, has entrusted lawyer Dong Yu to accuse Yang Peirong of enticing and hiding her adopted daughter and requested that he be transferred to the court for strict punishment according to law. The defendant has also hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to defend him.</p>

<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Municipal Union Will Request a Stop.</p>
<p>The French tram lines have recently increased their fares with the approval of the French Municipal Council because of huge expenses, the low value of copper coins, and the inability to make ends meet. The new price list has been announced on all vehicles and will be implemented from today. The increase is one or two copper coins per ticket. Previously, the first-class fare ranged from 7 cents to 40 cents, and the second-class fare ranged from 5 cents to 24 cents. Now, the first-class fare is 8 cents to 42 cents, and the second-class fare is 6 cents to 27 cents. The above increases do not apply to the three tram lines, because they operate the same as the three Chinese tram lines, and the fares have not been increased.</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Fourth District Branch of the Civil Union of the Second Special District will request the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to request the French Municipal Council to stop the French tram company's sudden increase in fares despite its annual surplus, in order to maintain the livelihood of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Little Hostage Kidnapped by Bandits in Taihu Lake Was Claimed Back Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zurong, the 14-year-old only son of Chen Tianyou, a wealthy man from Tangshan Baydi Village, Shaoxing Xiaoshan County, was kidnapped by Taihu bandits on the afternoon of the 19th day of the old lunar month this year. He was taken to Shanghai and hidden in the home of Chen Shiying, a Shaoxing native, in the third-floor pavilion room of No. 3, Ping'anfang, Lane 155, Xuehuali Road, French Concession. A letter was sent to the principal, demanding a ransom of 3,500 yuan for his release. It was agreed that the ransom would be negotiated at the entrance of Baoyuli, Caishi Street, French Concession, at 6-7 p.m. on the 9th of this month. The principal sent a representative to Shanghai. According to intelligence reports, the French police, led by Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Special Organ, and the Chinese and Western detectives, rushed to the negotiation site on time to wait. Twelve men and women, including bandits Shen Yun, Zhang Baichuan, Wang Achang, Lu Ruigao, Zhou Ruifu, Liu Xichen, Gao Bin, Chen Shiying, and women Chen Shengshi, Wang Chenshi, Wu Wangshi, and Fu Lanying, were arrested one after another, and the hostage was rescued and sent to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation. Because the police found that the defendants had also committed crimes in Shanghai, they requested a postponement of the investigation. With the order to postpone the hearing to April 1, all the circumstances were recorded in the 12th issue of this newspaper. The hostage Chen Zurong was temporarily detained by the police, waiting for his family to claim him. Now, because the principal Chen Tianyou is ill at home, he entrusted his brother-in-law Ni Xuequan to represent him in Shanghai, submitting a request to the French police to claim the child. Therefore, the police yesterday escorted all the defendants and the hostage to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court for instructions. Judge Li Changnian took the seat. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen clarified the previous situation, followed by the principal's representative Ni Xuequan stating the reasons for claiming the child. The official ordered the victim Chen Zurong to come to the front of the case and asked about the kidnapping. According to him, at 6 pm on the 19th day of the first lunar month, I had just finished dinner when suddenly more than a dozen bandits came with guns and kidnapped me. That night, I walked with the bandits to the Qiantang River, crossed the river by boat to Hangzhou, and stayed in an inn for one night. The next morning, Zhang Baichuan, Wu Achang, Zhang Ruigao, and an unknown person took the train to Shanghai and lived in Chen Shiying's house in Ping'anfang for twenty-seven or eight days. After the statement, he also identified the faces of the bandits (who came to Shanghai and watched the hostage). The official then interrogated the defendants Zhang Baichuan, Wang Achang, and Lu Ruigao, who all confessed, saying, "We were hired by Mr. Shen. The four of us went to the principal's house together, pushed the door open, and kidnapped the child, holding two wooden guns and two flashlights. We first tied up more than ten men and women in the principal's house before taking the child out. According to Mr. Shen, we borrowed money from them because we didn't have the money to kidnap the child." When asked about Chen Shiying, he confessed, "Shen Yun, who is also on trial, used to be my colleague. He came to me on the 16th or 17th day of the first lunar month and said that a nephew was coming out to study business and would stay at my house temporarily. He promised to pay 10 yuan a month for food. Later, he said it was a kidnapping and sent the child on the 20th. Shen Yun confessed that he knew Mr. Shen, who invited me to Dayi Apartment on Bubo Road and asked me to kidnap someone, asking me to find a place to hide the hostage. I didn't agree. He threatened to kill my whole family, so I had no choice but to discuss with Chen Shiying to temporarily hide the child," and so on. At this point, the official announced that today was the day for the principal to claim the child. The child was interrogated in advance about the important parts of the case. The remaining defendants would be tried after the police completed the investigation. After the announcement, the child was handed over to his family representative Ni Xuequan in court. The defendants were still taken back to the police station by the detectives for detention.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Jiang Xiuzhen's Embezzlement Case Involves a Former Court Clerk <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>It is Said That There Were Matters Such As Using Badges to Intimidate and Defraud</p>
<p>The Trial Was Opened Yesterday and Further Witnesses Need to be Summoned for Investigation</p>
<p>Hong Baoming, the owner of Dehe Grocery Store in Fuzhou, reported that his accountant Jiang Xiuzhen had embezzled 9,300 yuan and fled to Shanghai with the money. He reported to the local Public Security Bureau and telegraphed to Shanghai, requesting assistance from various agencies to arrest her. Later, detectives from the Old Gate Police Station arrested Jiang in Room 8 of the Jiangsu Hotel and sent her to the First Special District Court. After several interrogations, because the place where the case occurred was in Fuzhou, the court ordered Jiang Xiuzhen to be handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to Fuzhou for trial. However, during the court hearing, Jiang Xiuzhen confessed that the case was orchestrated by Hong Baoming in collusion with Lin Fen (who had quit), a clerk from the First Special Court from Wenzhou, on January 31 this year, in Room 508 of the Central Hotel on Hubei Road, using intimidation to coerce a settlement, secretly using his official title, that is, the court badge, intending to defraud money, and filed a complaint against Lin with the court. The court approved the petition and issued a summons. At 3 pm yesterday, Prosecutor Guo Wei came to the Criminal Division 9 for investigation. The defendant, Lin Fen, complied with the summons and surrendered to the court. The lawyer Xiang Xun was also summoned to the court because he was a witness. First, Prosecutor Guo asked Lin, saying, "According to the complaint, you pretended to be an official in Room 504 of the Central Hotel on January 31, using intimidation to make Jiang Xiuzhen pay thousands of yuan to avoid litigation, otherwise you would have to ask the judge to sentence you to five or six years in prison, and you immediately took out the court badge to show that it was true. Is this true?" Lin replied, "There was no intimidation or false use of the badge. Because Hong Baoming is my nephew, Hong invited me to the Central Hotel to help with the settlement that day. I advised Hong to pay a certain amount of money so that this matter would not involve litigation, and there was nothing else. I reported to duty on December 1 last year and served as a clerk in the First Special Court until I resigned on January 28. The handover procedures were also completed. The badge was placed in the drawer of the office desk, but it was not returned." Mr. Guo asked again whether a tea servant Wang from the Accounting Department had asked you for the badge and you said that you would return it when you left. Lin replied no, and said that after he resigned, he temporarily lived with a friend in the South City, and went to Hangzhou on February 20, and returned to Shanghai on February 25, and left Shanghai to return to his hometown of Wenzhou on February 28. He returned to Shanghai on the 8th of this month and learned about this matter, so he entrusted lawyer Shen Yiqian to file a statement with the court to clarify the facts. He had indeed been to the Central Hotel for this matter, and lawyer Xiang Xun and witnesses Chen Xishun, Wang Yuqi, Ding Afang, and Shan were present at the time. Now, except for lawyer Xiang, the other witnesses are not in Shanghai, so they have not come to court," and so on. Then, lawyer Xiang proved, "I am Jiang Xiuzhen's agent. At that time, I tried to make the two parties settle, so on January 30, I opened a room in a certain room on the second floor of the Juelu Restaurant for negotiation, but it ended without results. The next day at noon, I received a phone call, asking me to go to the Central Hotel, saying that there was hope for a settlement, and asked me to go quickly to prepare a settlement agreement on their behalf.</p>
<p>I went there immediately, and Hong, Jiang, Lin, Chen, Ding, Shan, Wang, and other nine people were already there. Both parties were willing to settle, and Hong returned Jiang Yang's 3,800 yuan. I then made a settlement agreement and Hong Baoming wrote out the terms. Suddenly, Jiang took the note written by Hong and took the opportunity to leave, and his whereabouts are unknown, so the settlement was not completed and a lawsuit was filed. This is what happened at that time. However, I did see Lin Fen at the time, but there was no intimidation or removal of the court badge. If there was such a thing, then Jiang Xiuzhen must tell me, because I am Jiang's agent and must protect her according to the law," and so on. Prosecutor Guo Wei said that since some witnesses had not arrived, he ordered Lin Fen to pay a cash deposit for bail and change the date to seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>A Happy Encounter by a Character Analysis Stall</p>
<p>A Red Car Comes to Pick You Up</p>
<p>Large Qing Copper Coins as a Sign</p>
<p>The Police Lawyer Asks for Temporary Detention</p>
<p>Recently, among the unemployed and wandering people in the Zhejiang Road area, their long, disheveled hair has been cut into bald heads. The barbers' uniform actions towards these people have also been regarded as strange. Wu Chengen, a 22-year-old man from Ningbo, used to live at No. 348 Tiantong'an Road. After the Shanghai war, his house was burned and he became homeless and unemployed. He wandered the streets every day, living a wandering life. At about 8 am on the 7th of this month, while analyzing characters at a character analysis stall at the New Garbage Bridge, trying to predict when he would be able to turn bad luck into good fortune, suddenly a man claiming to be surnamed Wang came up and said, "If you want to find a job, now is a good opportunity. The Zhaofeng Chocolate Candy Factory at No. 24 Dengtuo Lane, Dengtuo Road, West Shanghai, is looking for workers and pays six yuan a week. Why don't you come with me?" Wu thought that a good opportunity had suddenly arrived, so he gladly went with him. Unexpectedly, the man said again that the workers recruited by the candy factory must not have beards on their faces or hair on their heads. They should quickly go to the barbershop to have their hair cut. Because he only had nine copper coins left in his pocket, Wang gave him eleven copper coins and ordered him to cut his hair. After it was finished, Wang said again, "I can't go with you. You can wait at the entrance of the Xianshi Company on Zhejiang Road. When a red car comes, I will call out the password 'Zhaofeng', then you can get into the car and go to the candy factory to get a pass and work." Wu followed his words and waited at the designated place. In less than half an hour, a red car came from the west, with license plate number 1285. Wang was also sitting in the car. At this time, Wu thought that the person he had met was acting strangely, and because it was cold and windy, he stood at the entrance of the alley across the road. When the red car came, he did not come forward to greet it. At this time, Mr. Wang, having not achieved his goal, also took the original car and went east. Wu thought that this matter must be</p>
<p>not good, so he went to the police station to report the above situation. The police station also had a Tang Rongzhang who had also encountered a similar bizarre experience in December last year and had already reported the situation, so he was immediately ordered that if he met him again, he could report to the police. Yesterday morning, Wu met this person again at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road and asked how the factory's recruitment was going. He replied that the factory was full and there was no way to do it, and gave him two small foreign coins as a travel expense. Wu immediately reported to the 1285 Chinese police, who arrested him and took him to the police station. According to his confession, his real name is Lu Wenbin, from Pudong, and he works as a tailor, residing at No. 53 Juxingli, Xinzha Road. A strange copper coin was also found on his body. This copper coin was transformed from a Daqing copper coin. One side was pressed with a very deep horizontal line by a machine, and the other side was pressed with a vertical line. Repeatedly viewed, it became a cross. According to what the police know, when the 128 incident was urgent last year, traitors often used this as a secret sign. At 9 am this morning, the police escorted Lu to the First District Court, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the trial. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the above case and said that Wu Chengen was poor and had nowhere to go. For the convenience of the interrogation, the police allowed him to stay at the police station last night and asked the court to ask him. Although Tang Rongzhang could not be present in court today, the police had a way to bring him to the case. In order to prove whether the defendant was a tailor, a detective was sent to the tailor shop on Xinzha Road to inquire. According to the reply of seven or eight tailors, they did not know each other. Only a woman upstairs said that he was her brother, because he usually made clothes upstairs, so the colleagues downstairs could not know each other. After Ru lawyer said that the defendant in this case seduced ignorant young people and the circumstances were bizarre, the police wanted to investigate the facts to determine which criminal law the defendant had committed and requested temporary detention. After Judge Feng asked Wu Chengen, Wu's confession was completely the same as the above. He ordered the date to be changed to one week for review.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Fictitious Company Fraudulently Obtains Guarantee Money <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zigan's Intentions are Unpredictable</p>
<p>Arrested in a Hotel</p>
<p>Chen Zigan, a Sichuan native, who is already sixty-seven years old, falsely established the Tongyun Shipping Company at No. 46 Hankou Road in November last year, serving as the general manager himself. He advertised in various newspapers, soliciting staff and waiters to pay a guarantee deposit. A group of unemployed people went to seek employment. Mao Jiaogen and Yu Huajin, two Yong people, had been unemployed for a long time. Seeing the newspaper advertisement, they thought it was a rare opportunity, so they went to the Tongyun Company on November 12 and 15 last year and met with Chen, willing to work as waiters on the ship. Chen then ordered them to pay a guarantee deposit of 100 yuan each. Mao Yu immediately complied, and Chen issued a receipt, stating that the ship was now in Ningbo and would be able to serve one week after the ship arrived in port. Mao and others believed it to be true, took the receipt and left. After seven days, Mao and others prepared to serve, but Chen had already disappeared, and his whereabouts were unknown. Only then did they realize that they had been deceived. After searching around, they finally discovered that Chen was hiding in the Qinghua Hotel on Zhejiang Road, so they reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Pang Yutang to arrest Chen and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Summary Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case, saying that the defendant was charged with fraud and obtaining property in violation of Article 363 of the Criminal Law. According to Mao Jiaogen's complaint, he also presented the receipt to the court. The defendant confessed that the Tongyun Shipping Company was not fictitious, and the ship had to stop temporarily because the machinery was damaged and required a repair fee of 3,000 yuan. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to request bail. After Judge Wu Xiangzu reviewed the confession, since another victim, Yu Huajin, had not arrived today, he ordered the defendant Chen Zigan to pay 100 yuan in cash to be released on bail and change the date to next Saturday for further trial.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Inheritance Issues <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Si Yinjun of Zhenhai</p>
<p>Your newspaper's creation of the "Advisor" column allows readers to resolve all kinds of difficult problems. Every time I read the answers to the cases, I deeply admire them. Now I have an unresolved matter. There are five brothers in my family. We divided the property long ago. The eldest brother has three sons, the second brother has four sons, the third brother has no sons or daughters. The third brother died twenty years ago, and his ? is still alive. The fourth brother has one son, and the fifth brother has two sons. The third brother's wife, since her husband's death, has not adopted a nephew to inherit. According to what she has said to others: 1. She is afraid that the adopted son will be unfilial and add to her suffering in old age. 2. None of the nephews are outstanding or remarkable. If she randomly chooses one, the others will inevitably feel jealous and resentful. Therefore, she did not consider adopting an heir during her lifetime. In the future, after the death of the third brother's wife, rural women will not prepare a will or proper procedures. Inheritance will become a problem. According to the customs of our village, for example, if the eldest brother has no sons, the inheritance should be taken by the second brother. If the eldest brother himself prefers the third brother's son to inherit, it is called "love inheritance," and only half of the property can be given, while the other half must still be inherited by the second brother's son. Now I want to ask, since the third brother has no sons, the fourth brother should inherit, but the fourth brother also only has one son. Can one son inherit everything, or should the fifth brother be added to the list? I hope you will reply in a letter.</p>
<p>Answer: In today's social system, and in a Chinese society that has not yet escaped feudal customs, lawsuits over family property are truly endless. ? Your letter expresses your concern that the third brother has no sons and is unwilling to adopt a nephew, fearing that the division of property will become a problem after his wife's death. From our point of view, a person's property can be distributed to whomever they want, and others should not interfere. Even if the third brother has no sons, his wife should be inherited by his nephews after death. Only one person can be selected as heir from the room with the most nephews, such as the second or eldest room, and it is not necessarily inherited by the fourth room. Finally, we would also like to offer a sentence: "Good men do not eat the family's divided rice; good women do not wear clothes from their wedding." The meaning is that those who inherit the property of their ancestors are likely to fall into depravity due to food and clothing; those whose dowries are rich and whose families are wealthy cannot guarantee that they will not suffer for the rest of their lives. Good men and good women do not bother to pay attention to such things. If you are the so-called "fourth room," then we advise you not to fight for this unearned family property for your son. Winning a little family property may not be a good thing. If you have the ability, you should cultivate his education; if you don't have the ability, let him work. In the end, let him be independent and create his own path, which is the way to treat future generations. If you are the one son of the so-called fourth room, then you don't need to worry. Because we see that you are literate and eloquent and work in a public office, you should broaden your horizons. Why only ? at the family's small amount of property?</p>
<p>We pity you.</p>

<p>Jinan vs. British Navy</p>
<p>Courtesy and Respect in Friendly Exchange</p>
<p>Result: Four to One</p>
<p>Yesterday, the West Union Football Club had two Grade A matches. One was Yuyou vs. Agal at the baseball field, which ended in a 0-0 draw. The other was Jinan vs. the British Navy at Yiyuan, with Jinan winning 4-1. Several hundred people watched the battle at Yiyuan. Both sides showed courtesy and respect in their friendly exchange. Their performance was clear, pleasing, and commendable. Jinan's star player Luo Haiguang gave up football to participate in the Jiangnan University basketball tournament. However, Jinan still had the upper hand, with many scoring opportunities. Unfortunately, their strength was insufficient, and they were repeatedly saved. Nevertheless, they still managed to win 4-1.</p>
<p>First Half: Two to Zero. The navy kicked off at 3:00 PM and attacked first, repeatedly pressing Jinan's borders, but failed. Jinan attacked several times, benefiting from Gu Feng's strength, and the momentum was quite strong, but they also failed to score. After much back and forth, Jiang Shanjing rescued the ball from the rear and went straight to the front. He sent a free kick to Liang Shutang, who passed it to Fu Hexuan, who forced a corner kick. He sent it cleverly in front of the goal, and center forward Gu Shangxiang headed it directly, scoring a clean goal. This was only about a quarter of an hour after the start of the match. Not long after, another disturbance arose on the border. Zhong Yongsen dribbled the ball to spy on the enemy, and the midfielder entangled him and refused to let go. Zhong finally dribbled the ball out of the enemy's foot and passed it to the field. The ball was blown by the wind and almost went out of bounds. Zhang Qizhao hooked it back in front of the goal. The goalkeeper caught the ball, but Yin Guiyi chased it to the goal. The goalkeeper was anxious and flustered, and actually missed the ball. The ball entered the goal, and Jinan won two goals, completing the first half.</p>
<p>Second Half: Two to One. Switching sides and fighting again, Jinan, although in an upwind position, still had strong momentum. There was a fierce battle in front of the navy's goal, and the danger was not removed. Jinan had more than ten scoring opportunities, but unfortunately, their strength was insufficient, and they were all saved. The navy counterattacked several times, but also failed. After fighting for half an hour, the navy made a desperate effort to attack Jinan's rear. The guards misunderstood each other, and the navy's center forward Lamet shot a goal from a diagonal direction. Jinan also launched an attack from the center kick, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, and Gu Shangquan also scored a goal. One loss and one gain, less than three minutes apart. From then on, the navy's momentum gradually declined, and they only had the power to parry and lacked the ability to counterattack. Zhong Yongmei shot from a long distance on the border, and surprisingly scored. He was overjoyed. This goal was actually caused by the goalkeeper's carelessness. The ball rolled into the goal along the post. As a result, Jinan won 4-1.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Football Season Nearing End, Yuyou Suddenly Shows Astonishing Performance <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Played Against Formidable Foe Agal Yesterday</p>
<p>Result: Zero to Zero</p>
<p>As the football season is nearing its end, Yuyou suddenly made an astonishing move. Yesterday, it faced Agal, the so-called giant of Western teams, in the West Union Grade A competition. Both sides were denied scoring opportunities, and there was no distinction between them. The game ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Unity is Strength <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Liang Guanlian's performance was as good as Zhou Xianyan's. Wang Shusen's experience and Qian Yaobin's simplicity were both more impressive than in the past. Furthermore, the central defense line, Huang Ruihua, Ye Jinmian, and Shi Jinsheng, defended tightly and were impeccable. In short, all the players of Yuyou performed their duties yesterday. Only the five forwards showed little expression. Among them, half were either lazy or liked to dribble too much, or even hesitated and did not dare to move forward bravely. Opportunities frequently arose, but turned into fleeting clouds. This was the reason why.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Unexpected Blow <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Agal had hoped to triumph, but the unexpected result was disheartening. The forwards tried their best to advance, but it was not easy to enter the scoring area, and their shooting skills were not as sharp as in the past. In addition, the opponent's supervision was very strong, and they could not move freely. Even in the second half, when they were in complete control of the opponent, it was difficult to succeed. The central defense line was strong, and they could both attack and defend. The center Haisite was particularly good, and the interior was safe. On this day, the spring breeze was like scissors, and the ball moved like a compass, making it difficult to grasp. Although Agal was able to use it arbitrarily, it was less effective than usual.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Equally Matched <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yuyou was attacked at the beginning, but soon led the troops to counterattack. Dong Xiaopei passed on the right, and Xi Qiaosheng hit the ball in the middle. The interior guard desperately resisted and escaped danger. Sun Jin and Gu Jijin turned around and entered Li Shuoyou's foot, and then saw him volley the ball to the front of the enemy's goal. Xi Qiaosheng chased the shadow and shot at the goal, but the goalkeeper扑扑ed it out, turning the danger into safety. Yuyou had two long-range free kicks, one far and one near, and the goalkeeper fell on his own feet,夺脱出 the encirclement. At that time, the two sides were evenly matched. The Yuyou forwards, with the support of the central defense line, were able to besiege the enemy's goal and take the opportunity to shoot, but they were unable to make a decisive decision and lost due to hesitation.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Country is Safe <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Neither side scored in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, less than three minutes had passed, and Agal immediately pressed the city. Mike Taivie shot the ball into the goal. The referee, noting that the shooter was already offside, declared the goal invalid. After this, the situation was that Yuyou's territory was half-blackened, and the enemy's footprints were everywhere. If everyone had not had the determination and tried their best, they would have been in danger of subjugation. Yuyou, surrounded by heavy troops, launched three attacks on the enemy, but none were effective. The great battle closed, and the country was still safe. The game ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Zhu Jiahao briefly stated that the National Physical Education Implementation Plan decided by the National Physical Education Conference has been held separately by the central and local governments. After the National Games held in Hangzhou in 1919, it has awakened the attention of the national public to physical education. The National Government decided to convene the 20th National Games to promote the physical fitness of the people, but it was suspended due to the September 18th Incident. In this time of national crisis, if we want to revitalize the nation, there is no way to save the crisis without promoting the physical fitness of the public. After the European War, all countries paid great attention to physical education, believing that improving the physical strength of the people is an essential plan for strengthening the country. The National Games can awaken the patriotism of the national youth. Therefore, even though the situation is severe, the government is still actively proceeding in this difficult situation. Since the Hangzhou Games in 1919, the track and field records in various places have improved. It is regrettable that only one person from our country participated in the 10th World Games. The next World Games will be held in Berlin, and international preparations have already begun. All countries hope that our country will send personnel to participate. I have received invitation letters from foreign friends. In the future, I hope that all parties will work hard to increase the glory of the country. All the preparations for this year's Games will be under the guidance of you all.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Wang Zhengting and Yuan Dun asked whether the financial resources for holding the sports event were assured, given the serious anti-Japanese war. Were the costs of the provinces sending delegates to participate affected by the situation? After the discussion, Zhu, Chu, Xia and other department chiefs expressed that the committee will have the event as scheduled and the session was adjourned.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Chu Minyi chaired the meeting and resolved the rules of procedure for the association, amending Article 4 to establish a competition committee, a jury, and eight groups: document, general affairs, accounting, propaganda, reception, transportation, security, and health. Two competition rules, the National Arts Championship were divided into Boxing, Wrestling, Weaponry, Archery Pellet and kicking, and women's track and field were added softball and discuses, with age limits set at 18 for men and 16 for women, and the remaining conditions would adopt amended versions of the regulations established for the 20th National Games. Thirdly, the item based rules were that the latest regulations were adopted for both women and men's basketball and baseball while other would be referred to standing committee to translate the regulations. Fourth, Chang Bo-Ling was appointed referee and a committee was established, with Wang Zhengting acting as chairman of the committee. Fifth, instructions to meeting attendants and group leaders as well as expenditure budgets were amended and passed. Sixth, the national games anthem was sent to all department and city schools for practice. Seventh, the central stadium was to be contacted by the group chairman. Eigth, a second meeting was scheduled to happen in May, to be called by the standing committee.</p>

<p>The 20th Army Initiates a Zonal Preliminary Competition in Guang'an</p>
<p>Connecting the Provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to Encourage the Advancement of Huaxi Sports</p>
<p>North Sichuan Games to Be Held in Guang'an Next Month on the 20th</p>
<p>The National Zonal Football Tournament this year has already been agreed upon by the National Sports Promotion Association and the Wuhan authorities to be held in Wuhan in April. It is understood that both East China and South China will send teams to participate. North China initially also considered attending, but due to a conflict with the North China Spring Football Tournament, they will likely abandon the zonal competition. As for the Huaxi region, which is located in the remote western part of the country, there has recently been talk of participating in the zonal football tournament as well. It is reported that the 20th Army is in charge of everything. Last year, the Sichuan 20th Army's football team traveled to Wuhan and the Jinghu area, attracting considerable attention from various parties. This time, their participation in the zonal football tournament is truly a sign of progress for the Huaxi sports community. The Huaxi preparation situation is recorded as follows: The National Zonal Football Tournament this year is scheduled to be held in Wuhan in early April. Yang Sen, the commander of the Sichuan 20th Army, believes that in recent years, the Huaxi provinces have never sent personnel to participate in the National Games and previous zonal competitions due to their remote western location, which is unavoidable. Commander Yang Sen has always been enthusiastic about promoting sports, and has now telegraphed all provinces in Huaxi (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan) that the "National Zonal Football Tournament Huaxi Region Preliminary Competition" will be held in Guang'an, Sichuan on March 10th to select a football team to attend this Wuhan National Zonal Football Tournament, in order to encourage the advancement of sports in the Huaxi provinces, not to compete for victory.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Commander Yang Sen will also schedule the second North Sichuan Games, convening military groups from various counties in North Sichuan, to be held in Guang'an, Sichuan on April 20th this year.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>It is, after all, considerate of school children, from now on, school children can save part of their memory. Just because the most difficult thing for children to remember is geographical terms, especially when it comes to geographical problems in the provinces of North, East, and several others during exams. Now, the map of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe has changed color... When children study geography textbooks, these four provinces can be skipped. Of course, it saves them a part of their memory, worthy of a call of considerate of school children.</p>
<p>It is, after all, considerate of student parents, from now on, student parents can save a part of their book expenses. Just because children's book expenses have been increasing recently; especially the picture books are more expensive than other textbooks. Now, the maps of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have been transferred to foreign maps; fathers and brothers buy maps of the Republic of China for their children, which can be reduced by four sides compared with the old maps, and the value is of course also reduced. It saves student parents' book expenses, worthy of a call of considerate of student parents. The non-resistance doctrine is all evils, losing territory and abandoning post and escaping is all evils; however, in all evils, there are also two virtues, that is, the two virtues mentioned above. Using virtue to resist evil is not all evils, it is only nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight evils.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Dripping Water <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>Buffer Zone</p>
<p>In our hometown, a lawsuit of "encroachment on dripping water" has recently occurred. Zhang Dage has one mu and three fen of land. On this one mu and three fen of land, there is a three-bay two-wing residential house. Wang Xiaosanzi, accumulating some hard-earned money, bought a piece of land next to Zhang Dage's, and for the sake of his descendants, he hired workers and prepared materials to build a small, low, and short bungalow. But Wang Xiaosanzi's short house built the eaves under Zhang Dage's eaves, so you say I encroached on the dripping water, and I also say you encroached on the dripping water. Everyone is unwilling to give in, and has to alarm the officials and go to court.</p>
<p>Logically, Zhang Dage's house was built first, and the rainwater from the eaves drips down. Dripping on his own land is originally none of other people's business. Wang Xiaosanzi's eaves drilled under Zhang Dage's eaves, it is difficult to say that it occupies the sky but not the land, after all, it is dripping water on other people's land. If Wang Xiaosanzi is a friend who does not speak crooked reason, he should have shrunk the eaves by one foot before building the house. Then, the water from your eaves drips on your land, and the water from my eaves drips on my land. Each drips the water from his own eaves, and no one encroaches on anyone, so this lawsuit can be avoided. But Wang Xiaosanzi is ultimately a poor man who suddenly became rich, unreasonable, and still wants Zhang Dage to demolish the house and let him.</p>
<p>This kind of "dripping water" is originally a very small piece of land, since they have become close neighbors, everyone should talk about a relationship. But the fact tells us that now people love "give an inch, take a mile." If Zhang Dage is easy to talk to, Wang Xiaosanzi will falsely accuse Zhang Dage of not only encroaching on the dripping water, but may also say that Zhang Dage's house is all built on his land, so he will pester you endlessly.</p>
<p>The Japanese have mentioned this kind of "dripping water" nature of the "buffer zone" in Shanghai and Jinzhou. Now I hear that they want to play this trick again between Beiping and the Great Wall. Everyone should pay attention.</p>

<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>The enemy is deep and the enemy is pressing! Occasionally talking to a friend about China's coastal defense, that friend smiled and said... "The four doors are wide open, singing an empty city strategy." Naturally, the enemy's warships can only charge and expand horizontally.</p>
<p>Perhaps those of us who have visited the Wusong fort after the Shanghai war have seen the ruins of those forts. From this destroyed fort, I was reminded of a joke about Zhang He, who built the fort, all his life. The forts along the Yangtze River estuary were mostly built by General Zhang He during the early years of Guangxu. This General Zhang was from Hunan, a leather worker by origin. After joining the army, he repeatedly made meritorious deeds and led some old Hunan troops. For a time, he was a brave and good fighter. He first served as the garrison commander of Huaiyang, and later was promoted to admiral of Quanzhou, Fujian. In the year of Jiashen in Guangxu, he returned to his hometown in glory and invited a group of local celebrities to a banquet. So everyone gave him a plaque, with the four big characters "A, B, C, D". Zhang He was a military man with no literary talent, so he hung the plaque high, thinking it was glorifying his ancestors and his family was prominent! Later, he talked to his staff in the office unintentionally. The staff then said... "Commander, you have been deceived. Think about what background you have? This A clearly looks like an awl, this B looks very much like a leather cutting knife, doesn't the C look like a board for cutting shoe soles, and the D is simply an iron plate for nailing shoes!" Zhang He was very disappointed when he heard this. He sent a letter home overnight and removed the plaque, so it was spread as a joke at that time.</p>

<p>— Zhu Shoujuan</p>
<p>A General Sketch</p>
<p>At the time of the faint dawn, there are no birds singing to disturb your good dreams here. Although there are occasional exceptions, there are intermittent chickens crowing from the small courtyard of the neighboring house; what we usually send into our ears is only a rustling of horses and a heavy whirring sound, then we know that the sun is about to shine on the earth again.</p>
<p>The trees on both sides of the road in the distance are shrouded in light smoke and fog, as if newly bathed girls wearing cicada wing gauze... In the vague and obscure, seeing its tender green new branches swaying in the wind, makes people feel an incredible emotion. A young village girl, with red cheeks and gasping, shoulders a load of fresh and tender vegetables and red radishes, taking hurried steps into this atmosphere. Before long, even her shadow disappeared, but the small calling voice of buying... scattered intermittently in the surrounding air.</p>
<p>The lights on the buses and trams back and forth have not been turned off. At this time, the passengers in the car are not the ladies in fancy dresses, not the modern youths, and not the enchanting women, because they are still lying in the soft and warm goose-feather quilt, seeking the most pleasant dreamland. They are only carrying children with schoolbags in their hands, housewives carrying baskets of vegetables, and people in plain clothes. Running forward, reaching their respective destinations, to do their duties in the daytime.</p>
<p>The sun gradually rises and falls again, and everything gradually changes; unfolding before our eyes is another picture.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Copper Coins <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>A Hateful Thing</p>
<p>Copper coins, the ragged comrades who stretch out their hands on the street, sometimes may say thank you thousands of times to young masters and misses but still cannot inspire the other party's compassion and get one. For some people, they are regarded as extremely annoying things, and it is hateful to keep them and quick to discard them. Because its color is not beautiful, it is mostly heavy in quality, not as light as silver dollars and banknotes.</p>
<p>Miss Song bought a few small things at Sincere Company and got thirty or forty copper coins as change. Holding them in her hand, she felt filthy and heavy. Walking along the road, she hated them all the way, and finally secretly threw them away in a place where there were few pedestrians. Later, when I found out, I said to her; Miss! This is the best behavior of Shanghainese, but it is a pity that you secretly threw them in a place where there are few pedestrians. If you just threw them at the entrance of Sincere where there are many people, wouldn't it be more worthy of people's praise?</p>
<p>Two young masters of the Dong family went out to the suburbs to breathe some fresh air protected by a servant. In a small pond by the road, they saw two ducks following each other. The young master was overjoyed and dug out the copper coins in his bag and threw them one by one from a distance, meaning to drive them ashore. The ducks just wouldn't obey the order. You threw east, and they went west; you threw west, and they went east. After throwing a handful of copper coins, the second young master's bag was also thrown out. The servant's bag was also thrown out, but the ducks still didn't come up. He pouted and said; the copper coins have been thrown away, but they still won't come up.</p>
<p>Copper coins are indeed a hateful thing, I don't know why the ragged comrades on the street bitterly beg people for one.</p>

<p>Jiang stopped her and said; you are too busy doing this, do you need an iron now? The old girl said; isn't it easier to cut if the material is ironed flat? Jiang said; which excellent master taught you this, I have never heard anyone say this. The old girl heard it, had nothing to answer, but just lowered her head. Jiang didn't say anything more, looking at the Chinese numerals painted on the white wall, and asked; that pile of numerals is the size of the second master's clothes. The old girl said; the one on the pit, with two circles next to the numeral, is it. You don't need to measure, I remember it all, the height is three feet eight inches five, the waist is six inches eight, the sleeve length is two feet... saying, she raised her head and thought for a while, Jiang said... don't report them, I don't have that good memory, let me see one. So the mother and daughter hid in the house... and began to make clothes. The next morning, half of the clothes had been made. The old girl was afraid that the second master would wait for the clothes to wear, so she walked out of the door and planned to send a message to the second master, saying that it would be ready this afternoon. Just as she walked out of the door, she saw a carriage pulled to the door. Inside the carriage, there was an old man with white beard and hair, a fur robe and fur jacket, a hood on his head, a red face, and a pair of big eyes. Looking at him, he was full of spirit. The old girl was paying attention to this, and he had already opened the car door and walked out. Standing under the eaves, he looked up at the house number first, and then nodded twice and said; that's right, that's right, it's here. The old girl saw it, and it was clear that it must be the father of the Zhao company commander. They have already started moving in. She was thinking this, and the old man looked at her, cupped his hands and said; is this girl also living here? Only then did the old girl answer... Yes. Old man, your surname is Zhao, right? Company Commander Zhao came here yesterday, we talked for a long time. He is quite polite. The old man smiled and said; that's right, I am renting here to live. While talking, a soldier had already jumped off the carriage and was supervising the coachman to move the things on the car inside. The old girl saw the old man's situation, and she respected him very much in her heart, so she stood at the door and refused to move, just staring blankly. The old man followed the things in together, but he walked very quickly without turning his head, and went straight in. The old girl looked at it, and couldn't help but nodded a few times, indicating that this old man was good. (13)</p>

<p>— West Lake Yilan</p>
<p>After a few more days like this; one day, just at dawn, hearing the groom's family, it was noisy again, crying and making a fuss. Those meddlesome people, in the coldness of the Hua family's winter heat meter three or five degrees below, weren't afraid, they put on clothes and shoes, and rushed to the lane. They only heard that the groom had run away again, and someone who had graduated from the army said; "It's not running away, it's joining the army." A Yangzhou nanny spat a big mouthful at the crowd, saying; "Chew the maggots of your granddad, the groom left early, are there two grooms? Why do you say he ran away?" The crowd was spat at by her, and they really felt that the rumors were wrong; but hearing is not as good as seeing, just as the groom's family opened the door, a few pioneers boldly went in; the crowd followed one after another, and filled a room. With so many people, they weren't afraid that the host would issue an eviction order. They only saw Many Stars crying and shouting, wanting the life of his grandson's wife; the groom's father and mother were also forcing the daughter-in-law, saying that she shouldn't have tricked my son into leaving. The bride saw that there were many people in the room, so she walked into the crowd and said in a loud voice; "You all are good neighbors, I am going to leave you today, I must tell you about our family affairs. My husband, I persuaded him to join the army last time. Because he originally studied military affairs, and now at home, his grandmother, his parents, teach him to eat and make feces at home, ruining a promising young man. Speaking of the current national crisis, all those who can do a little bit of effort should go to the front line! Do you know if China is gone, will there still be these people of us? If the land is gone, the country is gone, can we still eat stably at home! I persuaded my husband to join the army, although he is not brave now, but he was very moved when he heard my words, so he left by himself. Unexpectedly, after a few days, he secretly came back last night; his family was so happy, but I was extremely angry. He said... 'Many friends persuaded me not to go, and forcibly sent me back.' He also tried to please me, saying... 'He couldn't bear to leave me.' I broke up with him that night. I said... 'If you don't love the country, what do you love a wife! If you go to the front line and defeat the Japanese, you will be my husband; if you don't win, you still have a best future to go, which is death! If you come back without winning, you are not my husband! And I am not your wife! If you come back today and become a dull machine for eating and making feces, I will let you go. Even if you love me, I don't want this kind of shameless and cowardly husband.' He listened to my words, and he was really moved. He wanted to leave immediately, so I poured him a glass of wine and said... 'Please drink it dry, this glass of wine is our last glass of wine! If it doesn't count as the last one and we have to pour you another glass in the future, then our glory is also worth an indulgence.' The bride said this to the crowd, some understood, some didn't, but seeing her generous attitude, listening</p>
<p>She stopped and said again... 'I am pregnant now, and I can't go with my husband, but in another five months, I will also go to the front line to do my part.' She also said... 'As for the family here, they all hate me so much, I can't stay here any longer. I will go back to my mother's house immediately.' After she finished speaking, she strode away. Everyone followed her out of the lane, and didn't come back until they couldn't see her anymore.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of magic she possessed, but so many people in the lane were deeply moved by her speech. Later, open-air meetings were still held every day; the things discussed at the meetings were always inseparable from her. Before, everyone called her the bride, but after her speech, she got another most dignified and glorious nickname, calling her "female hero."</p>

<h3 id="e188">China National Products Company and the Chicago Exposition <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>The opening salvo of the National Products Year is the opening of the China National Products Company. According to the second salvo, the China National Products Company and the Chicago Exposition Product Coordination Association will hold an export exhibition at the China National Products Company in the Continental Department Store today. Gathering the elite of the country, collecting the special products of various provinces, and publicly exhibiting them on Nanjing Road, where there is a constant stream of people and vehicles, the significance of this is far-reaching, and the mission is important. It is worth proposing to the people of the country;</p>
<p>(1) The mission of the National Products Company is not only to widely sell products, but also to improve domestic products. The method of improvement lies in the exhibition, comparison by exhibition, competition by comparison, and progress by competition. This not only gives consumers a sense of feeling, but also producers can use this to encourage themselves. I have always been critical of Chinese national products, the biggest shortcoming is that they do not seek to improve, and have no vision for foreign trade. They are crude and shoddy, only seeking to sell well, and think that they have done their best. As a result, failures are everywhere. Very few are willing to use meticulous thinking, strive for excellence, to defeat foreign goods. The failure of foreign trade in recent years can be painful. This time, in the Chicago Exposition, the lacquer from Fujian, the pottery from Yixing, the porcelain from Jiangxi, the embroidery from Hunan, and the national products from various places, all feel that there has been a great improvement. I have studied the progress of products in the Nanyang Industrial Exposition, the Panama Fair, the China National Products Exhibition, and the West Lake Exposition. This time seems to be the most attentive, which shows that Chinese people have not made progress in manufacturing. Unfortunately, there are no scientific methods, no research spirit, and there are very few organizations in the society that are engaged in promoting and encouraging them, so the progress is not very obvious, and there is little propaganda power abroad, which is a pity. In the future, if any domestic product manufacturing can conduct this continuous research, and the industry will seek improvement day by day, then the scale of its achievements is immeasurable. This has to be hoped for the consistent efforts of the production community.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese people have always had a mentality that they cannot trust domestic goods, and only value imported goods, especially among the intellectual class and the propertied class. Now, look at the displays and sales items of this National Products Company and the Chicago Exposition. They are made with ingenuity and exquisite craftsmanship. Why are they inferior to foreigners, or even better? Then the Chinese people's self-contempt and self-doubt can be eliminated. Taking this opportunity, we can widely persuade them, fathers advise their sons, brothers encourage their younger brothers, and even husbands and wives, relatives, teachers and friends advise each other, to take the consistent use of domestic products as an honor and beauty. Then the development of the national product industry will be more and more prosperous, and the manufacturing can be more and more refined, and change with each passing day. The benefits of this exhibition to the national product industry are boundless. This has to be hoped for the consistent efforts of consumers.</p>
<p>The exhibition of the Chicago Exposition a few days ago was far away in West Shanghai, and there were very few visitors, and the distance was too far, which was a pity. Now, fortunately, it is being held at the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road. The location is convenient, and the time is appropriate. I know that visitors will be more enthusiastic and dedicated, so as not to let down the hard work and perseverance of the organizers.</p>
<h3 id="e189">University National Products Movement <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yuan</p>
<p>In the sixth issue of the Shen Bao National Products Weekly published on the 16th of last month, I had the pleasure of reading Mr. Pan Yangyao's article "The National Products Movement in the Family." He mentioned that "the consumption of foreign goods is mostly by intellectuals. The higher the level of education, the more vigorously they promote foreign goods, which can be said to be a matter of great concern." Based on what I have seen and heard, the author believes that the consumption of foreign goods in society is most prevalent among the intellectual class. What is especially worrying is the habit of university students to use foreign goods, so I specifically bring it up in the hope that those concerned will realize this.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city with numerous universities, and there are tens of thousands of university students. They rely on the legacy of their ancestors to live comfortable lives. In a poor country like China, anyone who can enjoy a university education can be considered part of the intellectual class. When we examine the ability of the intellectual class to consume foreign goods on a daily basis, it is the university students who are the most formidable. This is an undeniable fact. University students wear leather shoes, use Stetson hats and Parisian hair tonic. These items have always accounted for huge numbers in our customs records. Although leather shoes made from domestic cowhide are slightly rougher in texture, they are far more durable than imported goods. Domestic hair pomades have also made significant progress in recent years, with good quality and low prices, but they are still not considered by university students. As for the clothes worn by university students, they are mostly imported Western-style clothes. Despite the good quality and low prices of domestic woolens from the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, they are not welcomed by university students who are dominated by the idea of "only wanting foreign goods, regardless of anything else." There are university students who wear Chinese clothes, but they are always in the minority. I have several friends who, after graduating from school and working in social service, enthusiastically participated in the national products movement, but they still wear imported Western-style clothes. When I jokingly asked them about it, they all said in unison that this was made while they were at school and that they would never have Western-style clothes made of foreign goods again. This shows how popular Western-style clothes are among university students. The fountain pens inserted in the pockets of university students used to be Waterman and Conklin, but now only Parker will do. As for Keds sneakers and cashmere sweaters, they are completely imported goods.</p>
<p>Sometimes I go to various universities to visit friends and see that nine out of ten things used by university students are foreign goods, which makes me feel deeply moved! This is only a manifestation of Westernization in terms of material things. When it comes to Westernization in spirit, it is even worse. University students like to mix English in their conversations, and amidst the noise, the tones of "Hello," "Mister," and "Miss" fill the air, as if they are afraid that Westernization will not come. This strange phenomenon can also be seen in the first-class carriages of trams passing through universities.</p>
<p>Analyzing the reasons why university students like to use foreign goods: First, they believe that foreign goods are exquisite and comfortable to use. After getting used to them, university students tend to buy them without thinking. Second, university students spend their time in classrooms, laboratories, and libraries all day long, and have little contact with the outside world. They have little understanding of the plight of a weak country and impoverished people. Third, the children who can attend aristocratic universities generally have some money at home, and university students have plenty of money, so they don't care about the high prices of foreign goods.</p>
<p>The bad habit of the intellectual class liking to use foreign goods is not limited to university students, but university students account for the largest number of people in the intellectual class. At the same time, university students are the future masters of our country. When we think that they have developed the bad habit of consuming foreign goods before becoming masters, the impact on the future of the country is unimaginable. Even in the present, there are no less than tens of thousands of university students in the country. What a significant impact these tens of thousands of loyal promoters of foreign goods have on the prospects of revitalizing national products! University students will occupy leading positions in the country in the future. Can we hope that they will have any thoughts of promoting national products when they themselves are stained with the bad habit of consuming foreign goods? The trend of the times will inevitably lead to all the financial resources of the country being sucked away by foreign merchants. Furthermore, since university students will occupy leading positions in society in the future, then the people under their leadership will definitely follow their example, and Westernization will become a trend. When wealth is exhausted and the country is destroyed, this will be the ultimate consequence.</p>
<p>What I have said above is completely based on objective facts. At the same time, we recognize the great mission that university students bear, so I specifically bring it up without any intention of criticism. At the beginning of this National Products Year, we have already heard enthusiastic expressions of support from many quarters. Now let us see how the universities, which are at the top of the national intellectual class, will rise up to influence and support it. We hope that university presidents, professors, and educators will advocate it from above, and that university students will implement it from below, creating a large-scale national products movement, leaving indelible memories and results for this National Products Year.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Introducing an Inventor <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Wenping is a graduate of an agricultural university. He is very fond of research. Although his family is very poor, he has been tirelessly working on the invention of the sofa bed, which he successfully invented in 1931 and applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. In 1932, he also invented a rice transplanter and has also applied to the Ministry of Industry, but the Ministry has ordered that the machine be sent to the Ministry for testing within six months. Mr. Zhang is struggling financially and lacks the 1,000-odd yuan for the testing fee. He now expresses the following sacrifice: If any enthusiastic person can provide financial assistance for the testing of his rice transplanter, he is willing to transfer the invention rights of his sofa bed and grant priority shares in the rice transplanter after the testing is successfully approved by the Ministry. It is said that this machine can increase the speed of rice transplanting by thirty times compared to manual transplanting in our country. It does not use gasoline motors and can be operated by one person, which is equivalent to the labor of thirty people. This is also worth introducing. If there are any enthusiastic people, they may wish to cooperate with Mr. Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Heady Admonition for Promoting National Products <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>Promoting national products does not require big fanfare and exaggerated advertisements with phrases like "big sale," "big discount," or "big sacrifice." You must know that in recent years, people have become impatient with cheap advertisements in various newspapers. If you still don't focus on practical matters and only talk about promotion, even if you speak eloquently, it's like a kind of anesthesia that cannot numb people's nerves.</p>
<p>The authenticity and affordability of national products have long been appropriately criticized in social discourse. There is no need to "prescribe a single remedy and sell fake medicine," nor is there a need to "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat." It must be added that the so-called National Products Year is a period of national products revival. That kind of "deceiving oneself and others" and "creating something out of nothing" can be washed away with water. Only by restoring the original appearance will things improve. If national products are truly authentic and affordable, people will naturally come to your door. Otherwise, no matter how attractive you make them, you won't be able to attract these customers. In short, promoting national products can be summarized in the style of the Analects of Confucius: "If I am very good, what is there that people cannot tolerate? If I am not good, people will resist me, how can I resist others?"</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Battery Factory Worth Introducing <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zudao</p>
<p>Although dry cell batteries are small items, according to customs statistics, the amount of foreign goods imported into China each year reaches more than 14 million yuan. How can we ignore this? In recent years, Chinese people have been able to manufacture them, but the capital is meager and the technology is not sophisticated. They are poorly made and the products are difficult to reach the top level. Moreover, the industry's vision is too short-sighted. They only know how to reduce prices in competition and do not know how to compete in terms of material quality. As a result, Chinese people are very dismissive of domestic batteries and the import of foreign goods has increased without decreasing. Now there is good news, and I would like to report it to readers in this bright spring of the National Products Year. My friends Ye Youcai, Yang Jichuan, Fang Yexian, Dai Renlai, and others are all well-known veterans in the field of national products. Seeing the downturn in the battery industry, they could not bear to watch foreign merchants plunder their rights and interests, so they raised funds to organize the Guohua Chemical Industry Company. They built their own factory at the intersection of Huade Road and Dalian Bay Road, hired chemical experts, selected the purest raw materials, and used the latest scientific methods to refine the Earth brand of various batteries. The quality is excellent and the performance is excellent. It can burn for sixteen hours and can be stored for more than a year. When I first heard their performance report, I seemed to be a little skeptical, so I took it to test it myself. Sure enough, I started guarding it at six o'clock after dinner and waited until twelve o'clock. Its clean white light was still the same as at the beginning, but I couldn't accompany it any longer. I went to bed, and when I got up at eight o'clock the next morning, there was still residual light, so I was sure that the performance of "burning for sixteen hours" was real. Later, I saw Earth brand batteries purchased a year ago in a friend's house, and they were still like new goods. This gave me powerful proof of "storage for more than a year." I am very happy, and now I have the opportunity to introduce it to readers, which is also a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Discussions on National Products</p>
<h3 id="e193">Charge Forward and Go Online Together <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>The bugle call for national products to save the country has been sounded! Kill! Kill! Kill! Let's all charge forward to the front line! At the same time, the enemy, foreign goods, is also desperately trying to break into our front line. In this tense situation, how should we plan our strategy to deal with the enemy?</p>
<p>The main force in saving the country with national products can be considered to be the several domestic factories in Shanghai. The China National Products Company is the vanguard of these main forces, and the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association is the headquarters. The organization of the National Products Salvation Army is probably like this.</p>
<p>Our first step, of course, should be to concentrate our forces and go to the front line together, but relying solely on the strength of the formal army is inevitably limited. In addition to the formal army (factories, companies, and associations), we should launch a high tide of national revolution, organize more voluntary soldiers (various national product promotion organizations), and sing the slogan "The whole nation unites to use national products" together to join the front line and fight a desperate battle with the enemy. Only then will there be hope of final victory. At the same time, the enemy has already copied our rear and is disturbing the rear. Look, in large and small cities in the interior, which place does not have the flag of the enemy (foreign goods)? "The enemy is deep, what can we do?" Our main force should also divide some troops to deal with him in order to save the oppressed masses in the interior. Otherwise, it will also end in a complete defeat on the front line. Also, almost all of the guns (mechanical production tools) used by our main force (factories) are the enemy's. Our war is becoming more and more tense every day, which means that their promotion is expanding more and more every day. In that case, before victory is achieved, we have already lost a key to be disheartened. Also, the symbols of our army (the decoration of national products) must be designed to be clearly different from the enemy's so that the masses can easily distinguish the faces of the enemy and us and make a unified attack. These two points should also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Jehol has already been lost. Our (raised) army surrendered Jehol in vain without firing a single shot. If we want to save the crisis, we still have to rely on our national consciousness. Only by using the National Products Salvation Army to resist can we succeed. The bugle call for national products to save the country is blowing tighter and tighter on the front line. The headquarters, the main force, the volunteer army, and the entire nation must unite as one and shout the slogan "National Products Save the Country." Let's all charge forward to the front line together!</p>
<h3 id="e194">My Opinion on Establishing Mobile National Products Marketplaces <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>The primary meaning of promoting national products lies in seeking popularity. If you want to seek the popularity of national products, you should first enter the people's hearts and focus on towns and villages. Then mobile national products marketplaces or mobile national products exhibitions would be the best option. The method is to unite national product factories to organize them, select goods, pack them into boxes, and transport them to the interior. At the same time, cooperate with the public education hall to organize entertainment fairs, which complement the mobile national product marketplace. This is to attract customers. The first step is to go to places with convenient transportation first, spending ten days in each place before moving on. When a mobile national product marketplace is established in a certain village, hire workers to carry goods and spread them to the surrounding villages. The prosperity of the business can be foreseen. Moreover, this kind of mobile national product marketplace can use temples and other public places everywhere, which does not cost much, and the power of advertising is also very great. Those who are determined to promote national products may wish to try it.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Reading the Opening Declaration of the National Products Introduction Center <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>National Products Year, National Products Year, a quarter of the year has passed in the blink of an eye. If someone wants to ask all the gentlemen who have dedicated themselves to the national products business: What kind of work have you done? Then I can be responsible for answering on your behalf. The establishment of the China National Products Company and the recent opening of the general office of the National Products Introduction Center are already the fruits planted by the hard work of all the gentlemen.</p>
<p>Without talking about the remarkable achievements of the China National Products Company in the past month, let us go on to read the opening declaration of the general office of the National Products Introduction Center. I remember that the declaration earnestly stated, "Engage in research on quality improvement, quantity increase, price balance, and market conditions." These few dozen words do indeed indicate the salvation and outlet for national products in the future. In general, national product factories that have a close relationship with the National Products Introduction Center should catch up quickly and jointly shoulder this important task.</p>
<p>To be honest, there are very few national products in front of us that can really compete with imported goods in terms of quality. Either the quality is simple and thin, or the work is sloppy. It is no wonder that compatriots are willing to spend the same price to find "goods from elsewhere." Anyway, the quality and patterns of some national product woolens can indeed rival foreign goods. The only fly in the ointment is that the prices are too expensive. It is impossible for us, the proletarian class, to ask about it. This is a matter of reducing costs for the factories, and I hope they will pay attention to it. As for quantity, it is even more pitiful to say. Often, a factory with short funds and limited output has to be monopolized by a local distributor. Large factories are also short of goods every day. Rootless trees and flourishing branches are everywhere. Moreover, competition among peers and year-round infighting, such as the rubber industry and enamel industry, have increased from three or four to dozens in recent years, and prices have been decreasing day by day. This is all due to business hatred, which is too unprofitable. They have completely forgotten the responsibility of developing products to the outside world, which is really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The National Products Introduction Center has exposed these malpractices and pointed out a real path, which is revealed in the declaration. If you ignore it indifferently, go your own way, then it really contradicts the slogans of "promoting national products" and "saving the country with national products." You should abide by the words at the end of the declaration, "The same pace, the same goal, and everyone work hard from their own position," which is the most effective and practical work, and is a necessary step on the road to "production and sales cooperation."</p>
<p>I would like to present the above personal views to the advanced members of the national products community for consideration.</p>
<p>Introduction to National Products</p>
<h3 id="e196">Talking about Economical Oil Stoves <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Wonderful in that there is no smoke and no noise.</p>
<p>No need to pump air, no need for denatured alcohol.</p>
<p>Recently, a new domestic product has been invented in the market, called the "Economical Oil Stove." I bought one to try it out, and it is indeed good. The so-called "economical" is indeed worthy of the name, because its advantage is that the procedure for using it is simple. You only need to light it with a match, and you don't need to pump air or use denatured alcohol, like the trouble with pumping stoves. It is extremely fuel-efficient, and inferior oil is even better. It is said to use oxygen in the air as fuel, so the quality of the fuel oil does not matter. It only costs three taels of oil per hour, which is only sixty or seventy yuan. In terms of firepower, it is more intense than any other oil stove. The highest temperature can reach 600 degrees, and you can freely turn it down for low heat. Whether it is strong fire or low fire, there is no smoke or noise. Even if it is lit all night, there is no danger. It is really an economical necessity for the family. Now I will explain the advantages and usage pattern (see picture) of the stove as follows:</p>
<p>Advantages: (1) Economical in fuel consumption: Burning fuel oil uses air, so it is extremely fuel-efficient. It only costs three taels of fuel oil per hour. If you light a low fire all night for eight hours, it only costs three or four taels of fuel oil. (2) Quick procedure: Light it with a match, no need to pump air, no need for denatured alcohol, just light it with a match. (3) Safe to use: After lighting, it automatically gasifies the fire, so the flame is pure blue, smokeless, sooty, odorless, and noiseless. (4) Burning temperature: As high as 600 degrees or more, the lowest is about 100 degrees. (5) Convenient for cooking: Whether it is a round pot, a flat kettle, a pointed bottom wok, or an enamel cup, it can be placed on it. (6) Can be used for heating: In winter, add a heat shield on the stove to replace the charcoal stove.</p>
<p>Usage: (1) Unscrew the oil cap and add eight or nine tenths (about one catty) of fuel oil, then cover it again. (2) Take off the black lamp head and turn the lamp wick upwards enough to light it with a match, then put the lamp head back to its original position. (3) After one minute, it will automatically gasify and emit a blue flame, which can be used at will. (4) If you want to use a low fire, just gently turn down the lamp wick, and the flame will become smaller. (5) After using it, turn the lamp wick down enough, and the fire will go out. (Pattern see picture above) Note: (1) Do not burn all the fuel oil in the oil pot, otherwise the lamp wick will be damaged. (2) Do not cut the lamp wick evenly, the more hairy the better, the easier it is to ignite. (3) You can add oil at will while it is burning, it will not be extinguished. (4) When extinguishing, just turn the lamp wick down to the point where it cannot be turned, and it will naturally slowly extinguish. Do not blow it out, because blowing it out may prevent the emission of gas.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Contradictions <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Qia Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>The world is so big, there are endless contradictions to talk about. If you want to talk about them, I am afraid that this publication does not have so much valuable space to publish them. In desperation, then, I will first write out some of the strange phenomena of contradictions that I usually hear and see regarding the promotion of national products. Because, I feel that these strange phenomena of contradictions are not only obstacles to the future of promoting national products, but also a manifestation of inferior roots. If people from other countries see it, I don't know how they will ridicule it! Now I will cite two examples below, hoping that Chinese people will correct them if they have them, and encourage them if they don't.</p>
<p>Person A, young and handsome, wearing a Western suit and leather shoes, standing on the podium, talking eloquently. According to people who have heard him speak, he raised his voice and turned red in the face, all for the sake of persuading people to promote national products and resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>Persons A and B are in the same room, chatting about everything from national affairs to social anecdotes. Later, they talked about the market being flooded with foreign goods and no one paying attention to national products, which caused tens of millions of dollars to flow out every year, resulting in a weak country and impoverished people, and foreign insults coming. They sighed for a while and felt a little depressed, so A took out a cigarette case from his pocket, opened it, and first took out a cigarette for B. B took it and looked at it, and asked A, "What brand is this?" A carelessly replied, "This is 'Chesterfield.'" B listened and looked at A's cigarette case again, and asked, "Where did you buy your cigarette case?" A replied even more proudly, "I asked a friend to buy it abroad." B continued, "Then, when you have the opportunity, please ask him to buy one for me too." Qia Yi Guan Zhu commented: What I have said above seems to be two jokes. However, as long as we can pay attention to observation everywhere in ordinary times, strange phenomena of contradictions like this are not rare at all.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Scales and Claws of the Cement Company <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiangliu</p>
<p>Reading the previous issue of He Koujun's masterpiece "Introduction to Domestic Cement" and the section on the Taihu Cement Company, the words were vague and there were still things that were not finished. Now, based on my own views, I have made a supplementary note. I wonder if He Kou thinks it is correct?</p>
<p>The Taihu Cement Company operated on a grand scale, hoping to produce 600,000 barrels a year. However, due to insufficient funds, the success fell short. The two smokestacks were already towering into the clouds, and the machines had just been set up, but they could not emit smoke, which was extremely regrettable. In 1926, the China Cement Company offered to buy it, and all the machines were transported to Longtan. A new factory was built next to the old site. As a result, the scale of the China Cement Company gradually expanded. At first, it only produced 500 to 600 barrels per day (which could be 300,000 per year), which was still second to Huashang (i.e., Shanghai Cement Company). Since the new machines went into production in 1929, it has jumped to become the second largest in the country, producing about 800,000 barrels per year.</p>
<h3 id="e199">National Product Inventor Fu Ji's Brief Biography of the Inventor of the Guangshi Spinning Machine <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Youshi</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Guangshi, who makes people remember</p>
<p>On February 12th, the Shen Bao published that "Xing Guangshi, the inventor of the spinning machine, was commended by the government by explicit decree; and the Ministry of Finance was ordered to award him 10,000 yuan." From this, we can know that the government's encouragement of inventors is spare no effort. Now I will introduce Mr. Xing's story:</p>
<p>Mr. Xing, whose style name is Bu Wu, is from Haimen, Jiangsu. When he was young, he studied at the Shanghai Jincun Normal School and Technical School; he usually liked to study. When he was fourteen years old, he made a bicycle out of wood. After many improvements, he was actually able to ride it. Later, he imitated Zhu Geliang's wooden ox and flowing horse and created an iron ox that could carry things and move; but it still had to rely on human power, and it would tip over when it encountered uneven roads, making it very difficult to use. So he gave up and studied the earth's gravity engine. He used sixty-six gears, and it ran non-stop with gravity, but because one pound of gravity could only generate one pound of power, it could not save power in particular. So he changed his mind again; but he had already studied for six years, spent a lot of hard work, and exhausted most of his family property. Finally, he studied the spinning machine, because it was easy to succeed and could save the poor. He studied for seven years, and the eighty-spindle roving machine and the carding machine were finally completed. But it was not yet precise. Mr. Xing was originally very poor. He was able to concentrate on research for more than ten years, really because of his wife, Ms. Ni. At this time, he was extremely poor and had to stop. A year later, he was assisted by Huang Changding from Haimen, so that he could continue to build the iron seventy-spindle roving machine and the carding machine. A year later, the project was completed; who knew that when the assembly was about to be completed, Mr. Xing could not bear the torture of poverty and hardship and passed away. That was on October 20, 1929, when he was only forty-one years old. In the beginning of 1930, a foreign firm in Qingdao sent an employee surnamed Wu to Chongming to test the machine in Chongming. He offered 10,000 yuan to buy the machine, but Mr. Xing resolutely refused. He said, "This machine failed because it was not valued by the Chinese people. I will never give it to foreigners." From this, we can know Mr. Xing's fearless spirit, which is revealed everywhere, and he is truly worthy of being a successful person.</p>
<p>Mr. Xing was oppressed by the economy all his life, so he planned to set aside special funds when he was financially comfortable to establish a community to specialize in invention; but his ambition was not fulfilled and he passed away.</p>
<p>Can Chinese people consider organizing a community to help inventors like this who are in poverty?</p>
<p>Postscript by Ji Ping</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Guangshi worked hard to study machinery and invented the Guangshi spinning machine, which made a great contribution to the industry in our country. It is a pity that Mr. Xing could not bear the economic pressure and died from overwork. It is not only the engineering community that has lost a star. Two years ago, I was entrusted by Mr. Huang Changding to write a systematic account of this fact, which was published simultaneously in the Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, and Shibao of this newspaper, and was deeply praised by the Chinese people. At that time, Mr. Xing had already died, otherwise he would not have advocated public publication because he had not succeeded before his death. The Guangshi spinning machine is now being modified by the Engineering Research Institute of the Central Research Institute based on the principle, and it can be completely successful in about a year. It is not a small contribution to the textile industry in our country. This is not only the effort of Mr. Xing alone, but also the hard work of Mr. Huang Changding and the staff of the institute in planning, which is admirable.</p>

There were slightly more shillings than American dollars, which was beneficial. Wah Bi all held back. Gold firms speculated and hedged the base gold. Banks speculated more on American dollars than holding back. June was initially traded at 30.08125 and 875 yuan, and later it was traded at 6875 and 75 yuan. There was only a difference of 0.0625 to 0.125. The market situation was extremely quiet, and the trend was extraordinarily ordinary. Banks such as Zhong Fu Shanghai held back, while Macquarie Mitsui collected. Gold firms also remained sellers until the close. The near-term bid for British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence and a half, with not much difference from the previous close. The American exchange rate was 19.375 yuan, 125 looser than the previous close.

<h3 id="e204">Securities and Public Bonds Short Squeeze Rises Again <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Northern Gang Compete to Buy, Retail Investors Struggle to Cover</p>
<p>Twenty-Year Customs Duty Rises One Yuan Strongly</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market sentiment had already been reversed and was still rising due to short squeezes. The market price trend was very strong. The Northern Gang was the most eager to buy, and retail investors were particularly strong in covering shorts. In terms of the war, there had been progress. Large long positions were holding firm, and short-term swaps were more than long positions. The market price had a very prosperous outlook. The government's debt consolidation had reached 54 yuan. Some people in the market were looking at 57 yuan. Let's keep this saying for now and see what happens later. Various 20-year treasury bonds had all reached the 40-yuan mark. New high prices were found in various market prices. The strength of new buying was far less than the strength of short covering. Yesterday's rise was entirely due to the shorts' resistance, which made the market price rise higher and higher. Although the two sessions in the morning market were trending up, they were still stable. After the afternoon market opened, the Northern Gang had extremely strong demand, and all items advanced strongly. The market price increased by one yuan. However, the salt tax was relatively weak. The quotations before the close of each item were still relatively stable. Multiple long positions in various 20-year treasury bonds were settled, with a slight number of jiao. The results were a unanimous increase. Among them, the 20-year customs duty rose the most by more than one yuan, and the rest were also close to one yuan. However, the 18-year customs gold long-term debt and the government debt consolidation only rose by 5 fen to 45 jiao. After the close, market sentiment was firm. Long-term government bonds, which had been silent for a long time in finance, had recently seen frequent ins and outs. Because this type of public debt was implemented in March of the 23rd year, although there was a need in the market, no one paid attention because there was a lack of sellers. Recently, a certain financial circle had hundreds of thousands of dollars that needed to be sold, which aroused the appetite of the general public. The open market rose by 5 jiao, and the dark market rose even more sharply in the afternoon, but no transaction was made. The total number of bond transactions was 11,126,100 yuan, including 11,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures contracts for salt tax totaled more than 4.3 million yuan, government debt consolidation totaled more than 1.8 million yuan, and the 19-year charity and 20-year contracts were also more than 1.2 million yuan each. The rest were less than 1 million yuan. The 18-year customs gold long-term debt and the sixth installment of the whole year were only more than 60,000 yuan, and the 96th installment was only 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There Is An Actual Need For Yarn And Cotton, So The Price Of Bid Yarn Rises Slightly</p>
<p>The yarn market is still flat. The market atmosphere in the afternoon is slightly firmer because there is more actual demand than yesterday, with more than 1,000 bales. As a result, market sentiment has improved slightly, and the market price has rebounded by 3.4 qian. However, there is still a lack of new buyers. Because inventories are too high, according to a survey by a certain institution, there are as many as 150,000 to 60,000 bales. Therefore, if the current yarn sales market is sluggish for a long time, the price may be affected. What the future holds depends on consumption. Near-Month Yarn Is Good for 4 Qian. The Market Atmosphere Is Extremely Depressed at the Opening of the Bid Market. There Is Very Little Trading, And Each Month Falls By 1.2 Qian. In the Afternoon, We Hear That the Sichuan Gang Has Business, And The Market Atmosphere Is Tighter. Each Month Rises By 3.4.5.6 Qian.

<p>The Cotton Market Has Still Not Escaped The Situation Of Revolving, And Speculative Buyers Are Absorbing The Amount And Are Firmly Holding Onto It. Therefore, There Is A Lack Of Chips In The Market, And The Situation Is Tight. As For New Speculators, They Are Very Cautious Because The US Cotton Market Is Closed.

<h3 id="e212">Grain Prices Rise in Heshia Rice Market Due to Strong Demand <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over twenty sources arrived. Dealers in urban and rural areas were eager due to shipping disruptions caused by the wind, leading to depleted inventories. Upon hearing of abundant supply, they promptly made purchases seeing no significant price increase. Sales improved, coupled with Tianjin dealers who had not been active for a long time and had exhausted their stock, prompting them to purchase nearly two thousand shi. Prices for rice from Suzhou and Qingjiao Nangang increased by 10-20 cents. The price of Duyangjian rice remained stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty sources arrived in Heshia. Dealers had high demand for high-quality white rice, but supply was low. Medium-grade rice was favorable, leading to a firm market for high-quality rice, with medium-grade rice rising by 10-20 cents. Thin rice had balanced sales and prices remained stable. Early rice had low supply and brisk sales, with prices increasing by a few cents. Dujian rice remained stable, Yangjian rice was tight, and premium rice was in short supply. Short-grain rice was in low supply and sales were flat. The market trend was stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice saw a decline, despite good local consumption, due to a large influx of goods. Newly arrived shipments included 6,000 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice and 1,000 bags of Jiangxi rice via Changxing Rongxing and other ships. Sales were low compared to supply, leading to a downward trend. Local merchants, having ample supply of Heshia rice to choose from, reduced their interest in Ke Xian rice. The overall market dealt with only over three hundred bags of Jiangxi early machine-milled rice and Hunan oil rice, Jing rice, etc. Merchants from Fujian were active, selling a total of around 4,000 bags of various types of rice. However, future arrivals are expected to be high, with changes already emerging in transit, making market sentiment less optimistic than before. The daily trading volume included over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi late machine-milled rice, priced at 9.05 to 8.64 yuan; 340 bags of early machine-milled rice, priced at 8.30 to 8.40 yuan; 60 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice, priced at 8.70 yuan; 1,200 bags of machine-milled red rice, priced at 8.50 to 8.42 yuan; 156 bags of machine-milled Jing rice, priced at 7.70 yuan; and 400 bags of polished Jing rice, priced at 7.30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Starch Market Near Stable, Distant Weak <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market presented a near-stable, distant-weak outlook. The quotation for foreign wheat decreased by 20-30 cents. The market was slightly stable for the current and April months due to limited transactions by Shandong merchants. However, trading volume remained low and lacked vitality. Customer interest in future months was minimal, and trading was stagnant. Large factories were keen to sell, but with few buyers, sales were difficult. Limited-price selling was observed, deterring further purchases. The future market depends on increased sales in the north. As a result, the current month was 5 cents better than the previous day, April was 5 cents better, June/July were down 2.5 cents, and August was up 2.5 cents.</p>

<p>Canadian Wheat Continues to Decline, Starch Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally weak. Although gold prices had rebounded, Canadian wheat continued to decline by 20-30 cents. Starch sales remained slow, and factory wheat inventories were high, failing to attract outside buyers. Australian wheat was quoted high the previous day, but foreign firms were not interested yesterday, so no prices were quoted. As a result, the current month was down 1 cent from the previous day, April was down 1 cent, May/June were unchanged, July was unchanged, and August had no comparison.</p>

<p>Sesame Shows Signs of Activity</p>
<p>Although red sorghum supplies were arriving, there was a shortage of high-quality goods, prompting sellers to raise prices. Buyers were selective and purchased high-quality goods, causing the market to rise by 2-3 cents. Yesterday, two cartloads of high-quality red sorghum were sold to inland merchants for 2.475 taels per load. Sesame had been sluggish for a long time due to unfavorable prices from foreign firms, hindering market activity. Recently, merchants from Shaoxing made purchases for oil pressing, slightly stabilizing market sentiment. Although foreign firms had not made any transactions, they had made inquiries, suggesting a possible turnaround in the market.</p>

<p>Italy is also a silk-producing country, but its production is low. Italian silk merchants in Shanghai often purchase Chinese raw white silk to be shipped to Italy for further sales in Europe and America. In recent years, due to the declining silk sales in Europe and America, Italian silk has become overstocked, leading to a sharp decline in Chinese silk shipments to Italy. Yesterday morning, the Italian mail ship Conte Verde departed from Shanghai with only twenty bales of raw white silk (samples) destined for Milan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign firm silk market saw lively sales for current filature silk as the New York bank opened. Speculative buying was encouraged, leading to rising prices. As a result, stockpilers considered taking the opportunity to hoard raw white filature silk. However, manufacturers felt that prices were too low and difficult to sell due to high costs. Transactions remained difficult. Yesterday morning, Liner Co. bought 20 bales of Snow Tower brand top-grade 18-22 denier even-graded raw white filature silk, priced at 540 taels. Blue Lefong bought 60 bales of medium-grade B-grade top-grade 18-22 denier 77-81 denier even-graded raw white filature silk, priced at 530-555 taels. In the afternoon, Dachang bought top-grade 13-</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw auction prices rise sharply to 760 taels, and the Dutch exchange rate narrowed by three shields. This led to upward market sentiment and a tighter trend. The guild set prices at 14.95 taels for #24 coarse white sugar, with Yuanji selling 800 bags. #20 medium-grade white sugar rose by 10 cents, priced at 14.4 taels. #8 Dutch red sugar rose by 10 cents, priced at 11.6 taels. However, considering the current exchange rate, #24 coarse white sugar already requires 15.1 taels. If there are no changes in auction prices or the Dutch exchange rate, the future market is expected to rise further. Domestically produced Chaoqing top-grade white crystal sugar was also offered, but in small quantities, with prices similar to before. Local factory crystal sugar was priced at 17.6-17.7 taels, and the market was firm. Jianbing remained stable.</p>

<p>The sales of woolen fabrics and broadcloth have remained good recently. Demand from various parties in this street remains strong, and selling prices are similar to last week.

British merchant firms accounted for the majority of the goods, including Western suits, fancy broadcloth, feather broadcloth, white drill, white twill, Walter broadcloth, and broadcloth, with British goods comprising the majority.

<h3 id="e221">From Earnestness to Humor <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Five</p>
<p>Recently, some people have moved from discussing "humor" to "earnestness." I think that is not always the case. For example, on a tram, someone gets off, leaving an empty seat. Two good friends see it. Friend A invites Friend B to sit.</p>
<p>Friend B politely declines, "Please, you sit."</p>
<p>Someone nearby, probably misunderstanding, plops down in the seat, happily occupying it. The two friends can only blush and secretly complain. Courtesy and humility are undoubtedly matters of earnestness, but the outcome becomes a source of humor.</p>
<p>Foreign powers, under the guise of "international cooperation," partition China. This is done with due process and is undoubtedly a matter of earnestness. Yet, in the China being partitioned, some people actually send telegrams saying... this is "fair and just." Not only are they singing its praises, but they also drag 700,000 residents of Beijing to "express their condolences." Pity those 700,000 people; even if you halve it, 350,000 are asleep, with others using their names to beg for rewards.</p>
<p>Slaves praising their masters is, of course, a matter of earnestness, but dragging others to impersonate them to solicit rewards is truly the height of humor.</p>
<p>Asking warlords with vast wealth and concubines to defend the country is already unreasonable, and it is fitting that they do not want to resist. Yet, they still manage to issue earnest telegrams saying, "Even if it costs us a single gun or bullet, we are unwilling to lose an inch of land." And some people actually believe it earnestly,掏out their wallets to donate generously. The result of the donations is that the enemy is still far away, but the warlords have already rolled up their money bags, and for "strategic reasons, shortened the defense line," flee the scene. Telegrams declaring the determination to resist are earnest, generous donations are earnest, non-resistance is earnest, fleeing is still earnest. Only telegrams requesting dismissal and severe punishment, declarations, and resolutions are gradually entering the realm of humor. Yet, if it weren't for Ma Zhanshan's betrayal the previous year, a certain organization in Shanghai demanding the return of donations from him would still be considered "earnest." Yet, if it weren't for the general who created the non-resistance policy requesting the severe punishment of his subordinates for losing territory, it would still be considered earnest.</p>
<p>Using love letters to ask a lover to buy scented powder and silk stockings is earnest. Unexpectedly, a socialite in Guangzhou uses love letters to solicit donations and donates the entire amount to the volunteer army. Yet, when it comes to rescuing the country, there are no rules, and this is still considered earnest. It's just pitiful for those modern gentlemen who are filled with melancholy and unhappiness when they see national salvation donations. Now, their hopeful marriage proposals are preemptively tapped for national salvation money by their beloved sweetheart. They don't know if the beauty belongs to them or to someone else. They must be very worried, tossing and turning in their beds. Yet, proposing marriage, begging for love, and the rites of Zhou are all unquestionably earnest. A failed marriage proposal, pre-empted by national salvation, is what we call humor.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything is earnest first, and humor comes later. Humor comes from earnestness.</p>
<p>Therefore, articles about resisting Japan and saving the country, full of earnestness, are now only left with many humorous feelings.</p>
<p>Naturally, the fact that writing "inclines toward earnestness" poses the danger of spring's arrival and disaster's approach is not an insignificant reason either.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Liberation of Ci Poetry <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I want to talk about the story of the liberation of ci poetry. This story has nothing to do with Mr. Zeng's "special issue." Mr. Zeng sent me the "special issue," but I haven't read it. I'm also afraid Mr. Zeng will respond to Cao Juren.</p>
<p>The so-called liberation probably refers to the liberation of form and the liberation of consciousness. Ci poetry reached a certain degree of formal liberation in the mid-Northern Song Dynasty. Su Shi treated ci as a form of poetry, not limited to musical lyrics, and not wanting to be constrained by cutting and tailoring to fit the melodies. It was liberated from musical lyrics. By the Qing Dynasty, ci that could be sung had become a thing of the past. Many ci melodies were lost, and even those with melodies had unclear rhythms. The ci poetry of the Changzhou School could not be sung, nor could the ci poetry of the Zhejiang School. The trend was that ci was simply a form of poetry. In the early Northern Song Dynasty, ci poetry focused solely on the themes of sorrow and separation between men and women. Since Su Dongpo, ci poetry could be used to praise history, lament the past, discuss reason, and talk about Zen. It also underwent a certain degree of liberation in terms of consciousness. Xin Qiji, a ci poet of the Southern Song Dynasty, was filled with grief and intense emotions, and his themes were even more diverse. The Zhejiang School of the Qing Dynasty admired elegance and rejected licentiousness. The Changzhou School focused on intent, which was also similar to the consciousness of the Song Dynasty. Now, if we were to say that we were retreating from the diverse themes of the Song Dynasty to the focus on beautiful clothing and fragrances of the Five Dynasties, and retreating from the passionate and vehement spirit of the Song Dynasty to the "darling I love you" of the Five Dynasties, and then calling this liberation, wouldn't that be going backwards instead of forwards? If we were to say that treating ci as a form of poetry, not confined by rhythm and melody, is what we call liberation, then where would that leave the people of the Song Dynasty?</p>
<p>As far as I know, this girl who had bound feet was fashionable for a while after she unbound them. Later, she grew old and died, and was buried in Jiangnan. Now, her grave is covered with trees. Even if Zeng Genius wants to resurrect her, it would be difficult to bring the withered bones back to life. I think it's better to let her rest in peace and not make so much fuss.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Random Parisian Notes <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shiyan, from Paris</p>
<p>(4) Edgar Allan Poe and Parisian Snowy Nights</p>
<p>At 9 p.m. on the 26th of last month, there was a public lecture at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris on the American poet Edgar Allan Poe. The lecturer was Professor Cestre of American Literature at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris. Despite the snow that night, many people attended the lecture. Professor Cestre spoke fluent French, and it was difficult for listeners to tell that he was American. He first briefly described Poe's life and masterpieces, and then discussed Poe's influence on Baudelaire. Finally, he mentioned that some aspects of France's most famous poet, Valéry, were also influenced by Poe. After the lecture, a French lady translated and read several of Poe's masterpieces. Her voice was very clear and loud, eliciting applause from the entire audience. The meeting ended near midnight, but the audience did not feel tired at all, and they all praised it as a very satisfactory lecture. Poe's life and "The Raven," which is called the American national poem, have been introduced by many people in China, so I don't need to repeat them here. What I want to briefly describe is Poe's theory of poetry: "Literature carries the Tao." This is not unique to China since ancient times; the same is true in Europe and America. This kind of concept of punishing evil and promoting good is probably based on humanity's sense of righteousness. However, when used in a very narrow sense, it hinders the development of the human soul. In the past, European and American critics always liked to find religious or moral components in a poem, as if poetry was only written for spreading religion or promoting morality. Poe ridiculed that Americans could not get rid of this kind of vulgarity. In his book "The Essence of Poetry," he put forward his views on poetry. He divided the activities of the human soul into three parts: intelligence, taste, and moral concepts. Intelligence seeks truth, moral concepts fulfill goodness, and taste pursues beauty. What is most valuable at the moment is sentiment, that is, a kind of yearning for beauty. In the moment of intoxication, the poet can feel the most sublime and eternal things that have not yet been understood by the world. However, the extremely intoxicated state of mind that a person possesses is, physiologically, only temporary and cannot last for long. Therefore, he said that the purest lyric poetry is only the shortest moment, not a long time. He used Milton's "Paradise Lost" as an example, saying that the most touching parts are only countless short poems linked together. In many other places, reading it inevitably makes people feel tired. He also said that the era of poetry singing the praises of morality and truth has passed. Poetry should have its own path to follow. Poe's arguments are the most modern, so his influence on the English and French literary worlds is extremely great. Some people regard Poe as the father of Baudelaire, saying that Poe's greatest creation is not his novels, not his poems, and not his criticism, but Baudelaire. Needless to say, Baudelaire is also called the father of the modern French poetry scene. From this, we can know Poe's position in the modern European and American poetry scene.</p>

<p>— Written by Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>Then she put Norbury out of her head, and went in and did the garden work with him. By and by others came in to help; at first this made the black girl jealous; but she hated that feeling, and before long she did not mind their coming and going.</p>
<p>One day she found a red-headed Irishman operating in the back garden where they grew vegetables.</p>
<p>"Who let you in here?" she said.</p>
<p>"Well, I let myself in, to be honest," said the Irishman. "Why shouldn't I come in?"</p>
<p>"This is the old gentleman's garden," said the black girl.</p>
<p>"I'm a Socialist," said the Irishman. "I don't allow any man to own a garden. That old codger's too feeble to do a hand's turn: he wants people to dig his vegetables for him; and there's more in vegetables than he'll find out digging them, from the time he starts to the time he's done."</p>
<p>"Then you aren't looking for God?" said the black girl.</p>
<p>"Not looking for God," said the Irishman. "If God wants me, he'll come looking for me. And I'm blest if He's any such thing as they say He is. He ain't properly made that way. There's a something pursuing Him in the world outside: that's what's the matter with us; and there's a something pursuing Him in the world inside; and that's the other thing that's the matter. Only one thing is certain; and that is that when the something is doing its best to get there, it makes a mortal lot of mistakes. And we—you and me—must do our best to show it the way; for there's a terrible lot of people thinking of nothing but their own bellies." With that, he spat on his hands and went on digging.</p>
<p>The black girl and the old gentleman both thought the Irishman a perfect brute (and so he was); but because he was useful, and would not go away, they tried to teach him good habits, and make him civil in his language. But it was no use. To get him to believe that God was something solider and more satisfactory than a Will that was not yet done might have been accomplished, even if it was not so easy to make that accomplishment seem reasonable and hopeful as Socialism made it.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Hu Huai Li</p>
<p>To Mr. Li Liewen, Editor of Free Talk: I have read the article "Why Liberate?" in the March 10th issue of Free Talk, which was originally written in response to Mr. Zeng Jinke's "Liberation of Ci Poetry." Whether what was said is reasonable or not, Mr. Zeng himself will answer, and I do not need to participate. However, when discussing the issue of "Liberation of Ci Poetry," why suddenly involve "a gentleman who discovered that Mo Di was Indian?" And irresponsibly say, "He made many investigations in a grandiose manner." Since my so-called "Mo Di problem" is involved, I must speak. Now, I believe the author's words are incorrect and require correction and apology. The following is a brief explanation:</p>
<p>(1) If the author of this article does not agree with my statement that "Mo Di was Indian," then he should discuss it in detail based on my original book "A Study of Mo Di." And I should also be allowed to fully reply in the same publication. The author's first step is wrong. He simply said, "He made investigations in a grandiose manner..." and arbitrarily ridiculed it in the newspaper without reason. I believe this damages my personal reputation and must demand correction and apology.</p>
<p>(2) If the author still wants to discuss it with me in the future, he may also publish his opinions in Free Talk. But he must abide by two principles: (1) What he says must be reasonable, and both parties must not engage in scolding or ridicule. (2) He must allow me to fully reply in Free Talk. If this can be done, it may be followed. If it cannot be done, please publish this letter and automatically make corrections and apologize.</p>
<p>(3) If you, sir, do not publish this letter of mine, then I can only spend money to publish an advertisement in Shenbao. This will not be rejected, right?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Hu Huaichen, March 10th</p>
<p>Mr. Xuan's Reply</p>
<p>To Mr. Huai Chen: My memory is very bad. I have forgotten the name of the gentleman who discovered that Mo Di was Indian. Now I know it is you, sir, with all due respect! In my article "Why Liberate?" there is indeed the phrase "He made many investigations in a grandiose manner." But the so-called "made investigations in a grandiose manner" refers to your attitude when making investigations (and I must also say that your letter to Mr. Liewen is also the same attitude). It is not "irresponsible and arbitrary ridicule"! However, you may again take out the home-keeping skills of investigating "Mo Di's nationality" to "investigate" "making investigations in a grandiose manner," then I cannot bear it, and the small space of Free Talk is not the place for you to show your skills. So, I admit that it is ridicule and apologize first.</p>
<p>Secondly, I learned that you have a book called "A Study of Mo Di," in which you collected articles for and against the issue of Mo Di's nationality, following the example of Gu Jiegang's History Office. Just now, a friend found this book in a dusty pile of broken books and showed it to me. After reading it repeatedly, I suddenly realized the truth and felt sorry for you and sighed for the academic world. Why feel sorry? Because the gentlemen who severely refuted you at that time were blind and did not recognize that your major discovery was a wonderful theory that was unprecedented. (Naturally, you have always insisted on your discovery and have not been swayed by public opinion—such courage is even more admirable.) Why sigh? Because the Chinese academic world has had your "major discovery," it should be studied together, and your method of "investigating Mo Di's nationality" should be promoted and expanded. Or a few more nationalities of pre-Qin philosophers could be investigated, or a few great people in the political and academic worlds of the world could be investigated to be of Chinese nationality. Wouldn't this be a great event in the troubled world, admired by all nations? However, unfortunately, the Chinese people have forgotten it as if it were a light smoke. In just two or three years, your "discovery" has no longer been mentioned by anyone. Even though you have compiled a book called "A Study of Mo Di," the academic world turns a blind eye to it. If it weren't for me suddenly being inspired like a divine being to involve this so-called "Mo Di problem" (unfortunately, I still forgot your name), and you took the initiative to write a special letter to request correction and apology, then wouldn't your unique learning be buried in vain? Therefore, after apologizing, I am even more than willing to "correct" and promote it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the "Literary Weekly" in 1930, someone named "Mo Di" suddenly stole your, Mr. Hu's, "method of investigating Mo Di's return to nationality" and discovered that you, Mr. Hu, were also Indian! This confused me! I don't know if this discovery has the same value as your, Mr. Hu's, discovery? I dare not judge rashly, so I take the opportunity of apologizing and correcting to sincerely ask for guidance (it is indeed asking for guidance, not ridicule).</p>
<p>Finally, your letter said, "If you do not publish this letter of mine, then I can only spend money to publish an advertisement in Shenbao." I think you, sir, are slightly miscalculating. I have a suggestion: Since you, sir, are prepared to spend money to publish an advertisement, then when the country is in serious trouble and it is time to save the country through aviation, why not donate the advertisement fee to the Aviation Association? And you, sir, can also make a high-profile call to gather strength and come up with a "Mo Di Problem" plane, which would be conducive to saving the country and promoting unique learning. Would you, sir, be interested? I am willing to provide free publicity. I humbly apologize, correct, ask for guidance, offer advice, and wait for</p>
<p>Sincerely! Yours truly, Xuan, a contributor to Free Talk.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Increases Two Divisions to Assist in Battle</p>
<p>Mutō to Personally Command in Jinzhou</p>
<p>According to military dispatches from Beiping, our troops, due to the extended battle lines of enemy troops outside the pass, have decided to adopt a defensive posture at the front of Gubeikou. Other units, such as Unit X and Unit Y, have been dispatched to launch a flanking attack on the enemy from a certain pass. A major battle is expected in the next few days. Mutō, due to the defeat in the Great Wall battles, has decided to increase two divisions to assist the Japanese army in the attack. Mutō will also personally command in Jinzhou. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The war clouds over Jinzhou and Xifengkou are growing more urgent. Chinese troops seize opportunities to attack and have successively invaded Rehe Province from the passes near Lengkou. Japanese air units mobilized yesterday to bomb, and the Nakamura unit, advancing towards Xifengkou, clashed with a Chinese army group lying in ambush 30 kilometers from Lengkou, resulting in a fierce four-hour battle. (Dispatch from Electric Communications Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Since the counterattack by Song Zheyuan's troops against Xifengkou and Kuancheng on the 13th dealt a serious blow to the Japanese army, news of the Japanese army's defeat has spread throughout Japan. The general Japanese public initially doubted it, but then the Japanese military and the "Manchukuo" successively issued threatening statements, saying that if the Chinese army attacked Rehe again, Japan and Manchukuo would retaliate by invading Pingjin. Moreover, military advisory officials meetings have been held continuously in recent days. From this overall inspection, it can be confirmed that the Japanese army's repeated threats are actually evidence of the Japanese army suffering great losses in Xifengkou. (Dispatch from China United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>At noon on the 15th, Chinese troops in Jinzhou attacked the Matsuo Noeda unit and were temporarily repulsed, but then counterattacked, eventually establishing an attack base for the Chinese troops. The distance between the Chinese and Japanese armies is now only 1,000 meters, and the situation is inevitably deteriorating. (Dispatch from Japan United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Aksu's Old City Captured by Rebels</p>
<p>Disturbances Said to Be Incited by Eastern Turkic Peoples</p>
<p>According to telegrams from foreigners in Xinjiang via Beiping, the disturbances in Xinjiang have developed seriously. Aksu's Old City has been captured by rebels. Chinese officials in Aksu's New City are said to have fled to Kashgar. The New City is about a few miles from the Old City. Disturbances are also developing in Khotan (transliteration), a place near the Tibetan border in Xinjiang. Chinese Khambas and other Chinese officials have been killed by rebellious farmers. It is said that the disturbances were incited by the Eastern Turkic peoples. Chaos is also reported in Keriya (transliteration). Initially, Muslims revolted and fought a fierce battle with the Han army near Aksu at the beginning of this month.

<h3 id="e228">League of Nations Advisory Committee Holds Meeting Yesterday, US Representative Receives Warm Welcome <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>It is Presumed that the Norwegian Representative will Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>Two Subcommittees Have Been Formed</p>
<p>To Study Arms Embargo and the Puppet State Issue</p>
<p>The twenty-one member advisory committee organized by the League of Nations General Assembly to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute convened at 3:30 PM today, lasting for two hours and fifteen minutes. After the assembly accepted the US government's reply, an attendant was sent to invite Mr. Wilson, the US representative waiting upstairs, to the venue. After a few minutes of waiting, Wilson arrived at the venue, and the assembly cheered. Following this, the issue of the chairman was discussed. The former chairman of the Nineteenth Committee, Belgian representative Hymans, is no longer in Geneva, and his position is being temporarily filled by Belgian representative Paul-Boncour. Paul-Boncour repeatedly stated that Belgium did not wish to continue holding the chairmanship and suggested that the position should be held by a representative of a major power. Swiss representative Motta suggested that the major powers should take turns serving as chairman, but both Britain and France were not prepared to accept the above two suggestions. As a result, Norwegian representative Lange was elected chairman. At this point, the assembly discussed possible ways for the US representative to cooperate, as the US representative does not participate in voting according to the US government's decision. Next, the assembly discussed the issue of arms shipments to the Far East. On the suggestion of British representative Eden, a subcommittee was appointed on the spot to study the matter. The powers of this subcommittee are very broad and unlimited. Although the issue of an arms embargo has been discussed, it has not been implemented. Irish representative Lester suggested that appropriate actions should be studied based on the third paragraph of the draft resolution proposed by the Nineteenth Committee regarding the problems arising from the major powers' non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The League of Nations has apparently received a petition from "Manchukuo" to join the Postal and Telegraph and International Wireless Telegraph Alliances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issues of passports, stamps, and the status of consuls stationed in Manchuria will also follow. In order to inspect this and related issues, the twenty-one member committee decided to appoint a second subcommittee. The second subcommittee will study this matter and then propose solutions to the twenty-one member committee. The first subcommittee consists of eleven countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The second subcommittee consists of twelve countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Ireland, Turkey, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Mexico, and Norway. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Plans to Leave England for the US Tomorrow to Lobby</p>
<p>Japanese representative to London, Yosuke Matsuoka, will be leaving for the United States by boat on Friday morning. Before his departure, he gave a lengthy speech to the press, stating that after the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, peace in the Far East was not guaranteed. This issue should be noted by the politicians of Britain, the United States, and Japan. Matsuoka also stated that he was not qualified to speak on behalf of Tokyo and that his visits to London and New York were not to obtain information about the relationships of the countries. However, if Britain and the United States had any plans to propose to Japan, Tokyo would be happy to study them. Regarding the Soviet Union, Matsuoka said that the Soviet Union would be ready in fifteen years, and there was no possibility of Japan and Russia forming an alliance, but he hoped that the relationship between the two countries would become increasingly close. Matsuoka then said, "The situation in the Far East is shrouded in dark clouds. I believe that the attitude of the League of Nations is making the situation more serious. The attitude of the League of Nations is part of the reason why China has taken such an attitude and why the Chinese problem cannot be resolved through direct negotiations. Japan's determination to fight alone to restore order in the Far East without any assistance is growing. Although the assistance of the League of Nations is welcome, today's matter is too important to our survival. We cannot allow anyone to interfere without responding. 'Manchukuo' provides our country with military and economic guarantees for security, so we are currently willing to sacrifice everything within the four provinces (referring to the three northeastern provinces and Rehe) to achieve our goals. If we fail there, our business in Asia will be swept away from now on. Some people say that Japan intends to conquer China and then advance into Australia. In fact, unless the opposite happens, we do not want to cross the Great Wall. Although the Beijing side in China is enticing us to enter Chinese territory in order to accuse Japan of aggression, we will not be moved." Matsuoka concluded his speech by defending Japan's attitude, saying that if no obstacles occur within three years, Tokyo will definitely be able to make "Manchukuo" a prosperous land.

<p>Puppet Government Guards Angrily Destroy Slogans</p>
<p>More Than Thirty Puppet Government Personnel Die</p>
<p>Japanese Claim They Suffered from an Epidemic</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: In mid-February, Li Wencheng, a soldier from the Second Company of the Changchun Puppet Executive Government Guard, angrily tore down slogans posted by the Japanese after getting drunk due to the atrocities of the Japanese. The Japanese found out about it and immediately dispatched more than two hundred Japanese soldiers to surround the company and search for the soldier who tore down the slogans. Fortunately, the company commander had previously demoted and dismissed this soldier, so the soldier had already disappeared before the Japanese soldiers surrounded them. The Japanese soldiers had to put on a big show. Since then, the Japanese have harbored the intention of poisoning the officials and soldiers of the Puppet Executive Government. On February 24th, they secretly placed a large amount of poison in the water buckets and wells of various kitchens, hoping to poison all the personnel from top to bottom. Unexpectedly, the personnel serving in the Puppet Government were divided into two shifts, and those who were changing shifts ate first. Before they finished eating, they felt uncomfortable in their hearts. More than a dozen people died on the spot. On the 25th, more than twenty people died, and hundreds of others were still sick, but their lives were not in danger. However, the Japanese spread rumors outside that the dead were suffering from epidemic scarlet fever. It can be said that they are extremely vicious. However, this shows that the officials and soldiers of the Puppet State are not obedient to the Japanese, and the Japanese often harbor the intention of poisoning the officials and soldiers of the Puppet State.

<p>Will Go to Rome to Meet Italian Prime Minister</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Rushes to Geneva</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th: British Prime Minister MacDonald has accepted the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is scheduled to meet with the Italian Prime Minister in Rome at the end of this week. The British Prime Minister's acceptance of this invitation is related to his efforts to organize a European "Peace Club." Before departing on March 17th, MacDonald will try his best to persuade French Prime Minister Daladier to visit Geneva. It is widely believed that MacDonald is eager to take the promise of naval equality between France and Italy in the Mediterranean to Rome as a promising basis for disarmament and as a sign of France's goodwill towards Italy. MacDonald will be accompanied by British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Italian Minister of War Balbo will greet them in Genoa. The meeting between the British and Italian Prime Ministers may not last long, but it is a memorable event. According to a dispatch from Paris, French Prime Minister Daladier is scheduled to leave for Geneva tonight to meet with the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 15th: British Prime Minister MacDonald formally announced tonight that he will go to Rome tomorrow night or the day after tomorrow to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but he stated that this trip is not to conduct any negotiations, but to ask the Italian Prime Minister whether he is willing to cooperate with him to save the situation in this difficult time in Europe.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 15th: French Prime Minister Daladier departed for Geneva at 9:50 PM tonight. He had several talks with the British Ambassador to France, Lord Tyrrell, this afternoon and exchanged lengthy telegrams with Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, who is stationed in Geneva. British Prime Minister MacDonald decided to deliver his speech in the form of a speech at the General Commission or Political Committee meeting on Wednesday or Thursday. The French Prime Minister is rushing to Geneva tonight and will arrive tomorrow morning. He can meet with MacDonald once before the British Prime Minister's speech is delivered.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, Morning of the 15th: French Prime Minister Daladier will arrive in Geneva, and British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will go to Rome. After the British Prime Minister's speech at the disarmament conference tomorrow, he will present the British draft disarmament convention. Since all three of these news items have been released, the situation today is extremely important. It is heard that the draft convention that MacDonald intends to propose is forty-three pages thick and is divided into fifteen chapters and fifty-three articles. Simon briefly told Paul-Boncour about the content of the draft. Both MacDonald and Paul-Boncour kept silent. MacDonald only told the British press that the plan he intends to propose is of a general nature. MacDonald himself only wants a gradual disarmament plan, rather than seeking quick results. The content of his plan is also taken from the files of the disarmament conference, so the French plan is also included. MacDonald's intention is not to create a new path. According to those who have seen the British draft, both France and Germany are afraid that they will not be able to accept it. Tomorrow, several delegations will propose suspending the work of the disarmament conference for eight days so that the governments of various countries can calmly study MacDonald's plan. MacDonald informed Paul-Boncour last night of his intention to go to Rome. This matter is in line with France's proposed European cooperation plan, so France can only express its happiness for the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th: Broadcasting, newspapers, movies, theaters, and public education will all be managed by Propaganda and Public Culture Minister Goebbels. Goebbels told representatives of the newspapers today that newspapers still have the right to criticize, but they must make criticisms that are beneficial to the government. Electoral districts that did not vote for National Socialist Party members, accounting for 48% of all electoral districts, will not be intimidated, but will be subjected to propaganda. The discipline and sincerity of this revolution are unprecedented. Those who complain because of personal suffering should be happy that things have not gotten worse.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Arrest of Engineers Provokes British and Russian Protests <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: Regarding the arrest of six engineers from the Vicker's Machine Company in the Soviet Union, Lord President of the Council Baldwin made a serious statement in the House of Commons today. Baldwin said that after receiving news of their arrest, the British Ambassador to Russia immediately protested to the Soviet Foreign Committee and inquired about what crimes the British people were arrested for and what methods were used to defend them, but the British Ambassador did not receive any satisfactory and affirmative answers. Therefore, the Ambassador has been ordered to make further inquiries. The British government believes that the Soviet authorities' accusation that the six people committed dereliction of duty cannot stand, so it has ordered the British Ambassador to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet government and stated that such unfortunate events may affect relations between the two countries. Baldwin also said that the British government will lodge a similar protest with the Soviet Ambassador to Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Japanese Espionage in Inner Mongolia's Xilin Gol League <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Japan Has Already Planned to Invade the Xilin Gol League</p>
<p>Mongolian People Hope the Central Government Will Pay Attention to Mongolian Defense</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The area of the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, including Inner Mongolia, comprises the Jerim League in Rehe, the Xilin Gol League in Chahar, and the Yeke Zhaomeng League and Ulanqab League in Suiyuan in Inner Mongolia. These four leagues account for two-thirds of the area of the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Among the four leagues, the Xilin Gol League has the largest area, covering an estimated 15,000 li (approximately 7,500 kilometers). It has a population of 50,000. Japan's Manchurian-Mongolian policy not only seeks to annex the three northeastern provinces but also includes the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. It is said that Japan has already planned to merge the various leagues of Inner Mongolia into a concrete puppet Manchurian state and then expand its military aggression to seize Outer Mongolia, a vast territory. Therefore, since the fall of Chengde, the Japanese army has advanced further, focusing on Chahar Province. Regarding the defense of Chahar Province, we have already made strict arrangements, and the security of Chahar Province is definitely not a concern. Deshixian, the League Leader of Xilin Gol League and concurrently Zasak Dorji of the Right Banner of Sonid, previously went to Nanjing to report on the recent situation of Xilin Gol League and border defense matters, providing detailed reports to the Central Government and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to explain everything. The Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek paid great attention to the defense of Inner Mongolia. Prince Deshixian stayed in Nanjing and Hankou for more than two months. After returning to Chahar a month ago, he went to various banners under the league to inspect them, representing the central government in appeasing the Mongolian people. The prince has now returned to Zhangyuan, but with the fall of Chengde, the Japanese army is actively plotting to invade western Inner Mongolia. To plan the defense of Inner Mongolia, the prince will go to Wutai in Shanxi within days to discuss everything with Zhangjia Hutuktu, the Pacification Commissioner of Inner Mongolia in Wutai, to avoid being caught unprepared. Recently, according to Deshixian's talk about the recent situation in Inner Mongolia, he briefly stated: "The eastern part of Inner Mongolia, from Hulunbuir to the Jerim League, has been completely lost. Now, the remaining western part of Inner Mongolia is under active threat from the Japanese. The current situation of the Xilin Gol League is precarious. After investigation, all the leagues of Inner Mongolia have long sincerely supported the Central Government. The Central Government should treat all leagues of Inner Mongolia equally and do its best to appease them so that they can be enlightened and know to serve the country. Some time ago, I went south and stayed in Nanjing for more than two months. I reported the situation of our league and Inner Mongolia to the Central Government in detail. The Central Government has appointed Zhangjia Hutuktu as the Pacification Commissioner of Inner Mongolia so that the people of Inner Mongolia can have a governing organ and avoid the Central Government feeling powerless. Recently, the national situation has become urgent. The people of Inner Mongolia all know to defend the territory and protect the country. However, due to the lack of equipment, even brave people and good horses are useless without sharp weapons. The area of the Xilin Gol League is 15,000 li, and the population is more than 50,000. The Central Government has issued only more than 100 firearms. It is more than enough to protect the local area, but it is really insufficient to defend against foreign aggression. If the Japanese army invades, there is a tendency to drive straight in. Western Inner Mongolia is helpless and can only be invaded by the Japanese army. Therefore, the anti-Japanese plan should pay attention to the defense of Inner Mongolia. The Mongolian people are good at riding and shooting, and Inner Mongolia produces good horses. The Central Government should organize Mongolian cavalry, issue firearms, and provide short-term training, which can achieve great effectiveness. Using them to defend the Mongolian border and assist in the anti-Japanese war will definitely be effective. The Mongolian people will definitely not be used by the Japanese." (March 8)</p>
<h3 id="e262">Various Worries About China After Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Worry that the Hot War Will Expand to North China</p>
<p>Worry that China Will Not Let Japan Expand</p>
<p>Worry that Commerce Will Fall into an Impasse</p>
<p>Worry about League of Nations Sanctions</p>
<p>Worry about the United States and Russia Uniting Against Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo's Kokumin Shimbun published an article by Nagano Ro on the 9th, entitled "A Study of Japan's Relations with China After Withdrawing from the League of Nations." The points mentioned in the article are very pertinent. A translated version is provided below for those who are concerned about national affairs.</p>
<p>How will the relationship between China and Japan be after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations? It depends on the actions of the League itself and the development of the war in Rehe. If the war in Rehe does not affect North China, then the League will not have a major adverse impact. However, given the current situation in China, it is difficult to predict whether the war will affect North China. What policies the League will adopt toward Japan also depends on the expansion of the war, which will have a major impact on Japan's relationship with China in the future.</p>
<p>The scope of relations with China is quite broad. In addition to China and Japan, there are other powers involved. First, let's observe the relations between China and Japan. Since the Wanbaoshan Incident the year before last, China has been constantly rejecting Japanese goods. Although the Lytton Report mentions the rejection of Japan, the League of Nations also tends to legitimize China's rejection of Japan. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, then the momentum of legitimizing the rejection of Japan will inevitably become stronger. Today, China's rejection of Japan has become an open secret. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, will the League adopt sanctions? If economic blockade cannot be implemented, then what measures will be taken? Japan's major issue at present is the weapons issue. The raw materials for Japanese manufacturing have always been supplied by China. Recently, the supply of the Yawata Iron Mine from Daye has been cut off and replaced by imports from Southeast Asia, so there is no need to worry. However, China imposes high tariffs on Japanese goods to prevent the import of Japanese goods. At the same time, taking advantage of the deterioration of Japanese-American trade, China's raw silk exports to the United States are very prosperous and attempts to contract silk industry and improve quality. This is one of the impacts suffered by the Japanese silk industry. Next, if the war spreads to North China after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, the League will regard it as an act of war. At this time, the relationship between China and Japan will have to change. Among them, whether the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will be declared abolished or revised by China due to the expiration of the old treaty is also a major issue. Whether the unilateral declaration of abolition can take effect is also a question. If Japanese in China are treated as people from non-treaty countries, then the issue of extraterritoriality will inevitably conflict with the issue of concessions. The Japanese residing in the mainland and the enterprises run by Japanese will inevitably be severely hit. At that time, Japanese will inevitably concentrate in the main coastal commercial ports. Therefore, it is speculated that Japan's trade with China and various enterprises will only concentrate in commercial ports such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hankou. However, whether the Hankou area can be maintained is still a question. In short, the deterioration of relations with China depends greatly on the future situation and whether the military situation in Rehe spreads to North China. Today, the relations between China and Japan are very bad. The economic relations between China and Japan will fall into a more difficult situation, which goes without saying. Therefore, we must have full preparation for the domestic industrial policy in order to advance into China in the future. This is the second thing that the people of the country have to worry about.</p>
<p>As for the movements of the League of Nations, it is because it coincides with the era of the change of the President of the United States, and the US foreign policy has not yet been clarified. In addition, the war situation in Rehe has not yet spread to North China, and Japan and the League of Nations have not substantially severed relations. If the war situation in Rehe stops here, then both the active and passive factions of the League of Nations will not take major actions. Because when the Chinese resistance spreads to the Tianjin area, the powers will regard it as a formal war, which may cause major entanglements. If the League of Nations hesitates and watches, China will also declare the severance of diplomatic relations. At this time, whether the League of Nations has concrete plans is unknown. At present, direct negotiations between China and Japan seem impossible, then the relationship between China and Japan will become a semi-permanent struggle. Wouldn't Japan's trade with China be in a more tragic situation? At the same time, the powers take advantage of the unfavorable situation of Japan's business and trade, and mutually advance into the Far East, and Japan's trade position is even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>From the perspective of international relations, the United States and China have long been jointly dealing with Japan since the Russo-Japanese War. Although the United States does not dare to confront Japan by force today, the United States' provision of funds and weapons to China is tantamount to killing Japanese by Chinese hands. At the same time, the communist army of Russia, taking advantage of the conflict between China and Japan, advanced into Manchuria to contain Japan. What is most noteworthy is that the assumption of office of US President Roosevelt is not far from recognizing Soviet Russia. In the future, the United States and Russia will be in the same vein, then the situation in the Far East will inevitably undergo new changes. From the above observations, it is of interest and worth studying how the powers in this complex relationship will change the Chinese stage in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Disputes over the Contract for Tea Tax Collection in Southern Anhui <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The Director-General Was Beaten and Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the Finance Department divided the business tax of tea in the whole province into two regions, Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui, it recruited merchants to handle it. There were eight bureaus in Southern Anhui. The Wuhu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Joint Association telegraphed the Finance Department to allow the association to handle it. However, the Finance Department recently adopted a bidding method. As a result, it was decided to appoint Cao Qibang as the Director-General of the eight tea tax bureaus in Southern Anhui. The subordinate branch bureaus were re-contracted by various merchants. Zhang Yizhai in Yi County, Ye Zhuomin in Xiuyu, Yu Qiheng in Qimen, Yu Guangxi in Wuyuan, Hong Meiyao in Tongshi, Cui Lianggong in Jingtai, and Cao Qibang, the Director-General, concurrently handled Xuanlang Guang. After investigation, the total amount of tea tax in Southern Anhui is 52,800 yuan. The first installment of 35,000 yuan in cash should be prepaid, but it has not been fully paid yet. The Finance Department is strictly urging the full payment of the ratio. However, the merchants who contracted the tax had a dispute with the Director-General due to too few branch bureaus and uneven distribution. Unexpectedly, a conflict occurred yesterday, resulting in a fight. Cao Qibang was seriously injured. It is unknown how it will be resolved. (13th)</p>

<h3 id="e267">The Northwest Line of Eurasia Decides to Expand to Xinjiang Within This Month <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Li Jingcong Will Determine the Schedule for His Trip to Xinjiang After Returning South</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hankou Line Will Be Trial-Sailed Next Month and Will Be Extended to Luoyang</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the westward expansion of the main line of Eurasia Aviation Corporation and the preparations for the new Guangdong-Hankou line, Mr. Cha Zhenhu, an employee of the company, told reporters this morning:</p>
<p>Trial Flight of Guangdong-Hankou: Eurasia and China Aviation Corporation have both opened up the Guangdong-Hankou line. China Aviation flies from Shanghai to Guangzhou, and Eurasia flies from Hankou to Guangzhou. Eurasia's main business is to transport international mail. Strictly speaking, it cannot transport domestic mail. However, because there are no other company's planes flying on the existing routes, it also transports domestic mail. The opening of the Guangdong-Hankou line is also for the purpose of absorbing international mail. It is planned to start the trial flight at the beginning of next month. The original plan was to extend it from Hankou to Luoyang to connect with the main line of Eurasia.</p>
<p>Borrowing Airports: Due to the company's limited resources, the Guangdong-Hankou airport facilities in Xiangyang, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou are not purchased by the company itself. The company borrows the original government airports and builds a few houses. The same is true for Nanjing and Luoyang on the main line. Xi'an, Lanzhou, Suzhou, etc., are all opened by the local government.</p>
<p>Connecting to Dihua: After the Eurasia main line once opened to Dihua last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government later built a radio station, and the flight was too risky, so it could not be expanded to the west. Now the Executive Yuan has ordered the Xinjiang Provincial Government to comply. However, transportation is inconvenient, and telegrams take ten days to return. The company previously received a telegram from Xinjiang Province stating that the local area was unstable and the westward flight was temporarily postponed. However, the company decided to fly to Dihua this month to install a radio to complete the Eurasia route. Manager Li Jingcong's trip to Beiping is also related to this. Li will return to Shanghai on the 19th and can decide on the date of his trip to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>He Jian Telegraphed to the Chicago Exposition Collection Office</p>
<p>Voluntarily Unite to Participate in the US Competition</p>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, telegraphed to Cai, Director of the Chicago Exposition Collection Office, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting to discuss and decide on voluntarily uniting to participate in the US competition. The original telegram stated that China's participation in the Chicago Exposition, which is currently exhibiting in Shanghai, has many excellent products. However, the order to stop participating was received, and although it was difficult, it was unavoidable. However, participation in the Chicago Exposition is related to promoting foreign trade and expressing Sino-US friendship. It is proposed that your province voluntarily organize an association and transport the collections jointly from Shanghai to the United States to participate. If you agree, how should the expenses be shared, and please request central government subsidies, and recommend someone to be responsible for leading the transportation and putting it on the ocean? Please telegraph to inform your province to send someone to Shanghai to gather merchants and jointly handle it. I am looking forward to your reply. He Jian bows, cold.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association held the first plenary meeting of the Northern and Southern Rice Groups at the Cuixiu Hall in Yuyuan Garden in the city at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday.

After discussing and regulating the industry rules, all members have been able to abide by the regulations, and business performance has been good. However, a few stores are still thinking about undermining the regulations of the association, so it is appropriate to discuss practical measures to deal with them. The letter from the rural co-workers in the south of the city stated that the rural business is slightly different from that of this street, etc. It was decided that the rural group leaders Yang Yinggang and Zhang Yinnan should handle it. The members discussed each item (1) The date and time of the group's plenary meeting, it was decided to hold meetings at 3:00 PM on the 2nd and 16th of each month (1) After that, it was stipulated that the chairman should be the general affairs group leader of the north and south (1) It was stipulated that the commission for foreign rice should be increased. It was decided that the commission should be increased by 15 cents for every 200 pounds. Each mark should be at least 50 bags. If there are a small number of bags, add 20 cents. The balance should be settled at the end of the month, and all discounts should be included. If there are violations, deal with them in the same way as the Hedong rice (1) Report on the dispute over the bucket rice.

Those who exceed the deadline should be 3 points. All balances must be settled at the end of the month. The meeting adjourned, and it was six o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e275">The Annual Reports of the Various Departments of the Municipal Council <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>The Park Management Department: Last year, the Hongkou Park was expanded by 21 acres and prepared as a sports field. A tree nursery was added at the corner of Jiangwan Road and Huishan Road. Many modifications were made to the Waiqiao Park, and a summer shelter was specially built. Trees were planted and children's sports equipment was added to the children's playground on Nanyang Road. The Hongkou Park was closed and reopened on March 19. There were 120,000 sports fields for football, baseball, softball, lawn tennis, etc., 88 tennis courts, 9 racecourses, and one golf course. A sports field was also set up in Huishan Park, where the lawn tennis court is the best. A total of 85 concerts were held in the parks. Zhaofeng Park was the most popular, and the zoo was often crowded, with a total of 780,000 visitors throughout the year. Statistics for each park show that there were a total of approximately 2.1 million visitors throughout the year. This number is slightly less than in 1931, because Hongkou Park was closed, which greatly reduced the number of visitors.</p>
<p>The Chinese Language Department: The foreign staff of the Municipal Council learn Chinese, either the Beijing language or the local language. Therefore, there is a Chinese language department. During the martial law period last year, classes were suspended. Afterwards, the Deputy Director of the Department led 22 Chinese teachers and joined the Chinese team of the business community and were assigned to various defense troops to serve as interpreters. Therefore, the defense troops and the residents were not isolated. The teaching method of the department is the direct method. Usually, students can complete their studies in three years, and some can graduate in less than three years. In addition, the Chinese documents received by the Municipal Council are translated into English by the department.

<h3 id="e276">The Three Principles of the KMT Party Headquarters in Shanghai and Seven Counties Rectify the Charitable Properties of the Seven Counties <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai County Sends Personnel to Express Their Views</p>
<p>Five Improvement Plans Will Be Discussed at the Meeting</p>
<p>The KMT Party Headquarters in Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, Chuansha, Jinshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, and other seven counties of the old Song prefecture, in view of the fact that the administrative power of the seven-county charitable properties belongs to the people of the seven counties and is now monopolized by a few people, which is illegal, and that the charitable undertakings held over the years only have the Puji, Yuying, and Quanjie halls, which are simple in equipment and corrupt in content, the seven-county party headquarters proposed rectification at this provincial congress, which was approved and the provincial party headquarters sent a letter to the provincial government. The Shanghai County Party Headquarters recently sent Executive Committee members Peng Liren and Jin Zuobao, and Supervisory Committee member Zhang Yi to Songjiang to inspect the Puji and Yuying halls together with representatives of the Songjiang County Party Headquarters. They have now returned to Shanghai. Inspector Peng Liren published the inspection process and improvement opinions yesterday, and distributed them to the seven county party headquarters for a regular meeting to discuss them. The following is a record:</p>
<h3 id="e277">Inspection Results <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>This time, I, along with comrades Jin and Zhang, went to Songjiang to first inspect the Pujitang, Yuyingtang, and Quanjietang. The Pujitang is a home specifically for the elderly. The elderly inside are dressed in ragged, filthy clothes. They eat only a bowl of cold rice each meal, and receive one copper coin per day, barely enough to buy a piece of tofu. They sleep on straw and old cotton batting without any beds. The air is foul. The elderly cry out for help, their misery unbearable to witness, making it impossible to stay long. The lives of the elderly being cared for are truly worse than those of prisoners or beggars. We then went to the Yuyingtang for a detailed inspection, but were also unsatisfied. Regulations stipulate that one wet nurse should feed two infants, but the home often has one nurse feeding three. The nurses frequently fall ill, and all facilities fail to meet sanitary standards, resulting in most of the infants being unable to thrive. We did not have time to visit the Quanjietang, but it fundamentally does not align with modern trends and should be thoroughly reformed. Based on the findings of the inspection, I propose the following improvement plan:</p>
<h3 id="e278">Adding Board Members <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>(1) The current charitable board of directors has thirty members who exist in name only and are generally not responsible. Only a few individuals control it, leading to rampant corruption. It is proposed to add six more members, one from each county except Songjiang, for a total of thirty-six. They will be divided into twelve groups by lottery, with three members per group, serving as monthly directors. Each group must reside in the association to oversee general affairs and inspect the conditions of each hall at any time. After this, only one general meeting will be held each year to decide the year's plan of action and budget, review the past year's accounts, and publish a report to be widely distributed to all sectors of the seven counties to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Popular Election of Directors <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>(2) Currently, the directors are all decided by the county governments, which send letters to the Songjiang County government requesting appointments. The county government only approaches the gentry. Although there may be honest and impartial commoners suitable for charitable directors, the county government has no way of knowing. It is proposed that, before the popular election of county heads, these directors be elected by the county representatives' assembly. There should be no restrictions on party membership. After the election, the county party headquarters will send a letter to the county government requesting the issuance of certificates. In the future, when county heads are popularly elected, these directors will be elected at the same time as the county head. Only in this way can public opinion be widely solicited and charitable funds properly managed.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Defining the Boundaries of the Three Halls <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>(3) Currently, the boundaries of the three halls are clearly defined, leading to a relative shortage of funds for the Pujitang, causing the elderly to suffer mistreatment. The lack of funds is also one of the reasons. Previously, each county distributed these charitable funds. Songjiang County argues that it is an integral whole and cannot be divided. However, the three halls all serve the cause of charity. Why can't there be overall planning? In the future, the boundaries of the three halls should be broken down, and separate plans and budgets should be set. The Pujitang should be renamed as a nursing home. While it may not be able to provide fine silk clothing and rich meat, it must ensure that the elderly are well-fed and warmly clothed.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Establishing a Daycare Center <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>(4) The Yuyingtang should establish a daycare center. In addition to continuing to care for orphaned and impoverished infants, infants of female workers or impoverished families whose mothers cannot breastfeed or care for them due to the need to earn a living should be allowed to be placed in the center. This will promote new endeavors to meet the needs of modern society.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Re-establishing a Women's Vocational School <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>(5) The Quanjietang should be transformed into a women's vocational training school. All virtuous women from wealthy families currently housed there should be ordered to return home. Those without property and unable to support themselves should be transferred to the training school. Other unemployed women should be recruited into the school and taught various skills suitable for women, as well as common knowledge and basic literacy, so that women can be self-reliant and promote the realization of equal economic status between men and women.</p>

<p>Lovers Arrested and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Li Xiuying, a nineteen-year-old woman from Taixing, residing at a certain address on Jishi Fei Road in the Chinese Settlement, possesses some beauty. She used to work as a female laborer in the Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. Recently, she fell in love with Ma Yueting, a twenty-four-year-old man from Shandong. Their hearts were in tune, filled with affection. On the eighteenth of last month, Ma lured her to No. 272 Huasheng Road (inside the Gongda Cotton Mill's factory housing) and they began living together as husband and wife. The other day, her elder brother, Li Baixiang, discovered their hiding place and reported the situation to the Municipal Police Bureau, which dispatched detective Zhao Caoqiao to the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. The patrol chief sent detective Gui Shou to secretly investigate the address, arrest Ma, and bring Li Xiuying with him to the police station. The patrol chief ordered Ma Yueting to be detained, and Li was handed over to her brother Li Baixiang to take home. This morning, Ma was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, recounted the events, stating that Li Xiuying claimed to be twenty-two years old at the police station, but her brother insisted she was nineteen. Li stated that she willingly lived with the defendant. The police station had no objection to the Public Security Bureau's request to extradite the defendant, but requested that an official letter be submitted afterward. Li Baixiang then testified that his sister, Xiuying, was indeed nineteen years old and had been betrothed to someone last winter in their hometown. Li Xiuying insisted that she was twenty-two years old, born in the Year of the Rat, and that her parents had passed away. She claimed that she willingly fell in love with the defendant and did not know that her brothers had betrothed her to someone else. The court asked, "Your three brothers testified that you are nineteen years old." The woman replied, "They are three mouths, and I only have one. I cannot argue. I must let them say what they want." The defendant testified that Li Xiuying willingly followed him to be his wife and that he did not abduct her. They had only been in a relationship for about a month. Furthermore, her brothers and sisters had visited his home before, asking for his judgment. Detective Zhao Caoqiao testified that the family did not report her missing to the bureau at the time and did not know the inside story. He requested that the extradition report be submitted. Judge Wu Zehan ordered Ma Yueting to be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Case of the Notorious Bandit Is Heard <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Yong'an, also known as Zhai Yong'an, a notorious bandit from Qingjiang, opened fire on Liyuan Road in the two cities on July 28 of last year, killing Municipal Public Security Bureau police officer Zhang Hanchen and wounding police officer Sun Jiming. He also robbed Sun's pistol. Public Security Bureau detectives arrested Zhou and sent him to Nanjing, searching for the robbed pistol. However, Zhou took the opportunity to escape, removed his handcuffs, and fled to Shanghai. Despite a strict search, he was not apprehended. On the thirteenth of this month, at noon, Chinese Detective Chief Liu Junqing of the Old Patrol Station received a tip and arrested Zhou in the Shenjiatan area of Yangshupu. A pistol and four bullets were found at No. 80 Bailu Road in Zhabei. He was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Criminal Court President Feng Shide opened a court session for further questioning. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the Municipal Public Security Bureau had sent personnel to the case today and requested extradition, to which the patrol station did not object. The representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted an official letter requesting permission to extradite Zhou. After questioning Zhou briefly, Judge Feng ordered him to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau personnel to be taken back for further investigation. The case of the notorious bandit is being heard.</p>
<p>Liu A'gen et al. Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and 包探 Wang Jiaju of the Old Patrol Station previously arrested the bandits Liu A'gen, Lu Peiqing, Weng A'xiao, Gu A'si, Feng Yuanchang, Li Jinbiao, Yu Songshan, Xu Xuesheng, and Feng Si, confiscating two pistols, seven bullets, one gold ring, twenty-one pawn tickets, and one fur robe. They were sent to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, the court continued the interrogation. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendants were found to have no crimes in Shanghai but had committed multiple armed robberies in Kunshan. Today, the Public Security Bureau of Kunshan County sent personnel to request extradition, to which the patrol station had no objection. The court should review the case according to the law. The leader of the investigation team of the Public Security Bureau of Kunshan County, Jiang Fachang, submitted the case and presented an official letter requesting permission to extradite the defendants. Judge Feng Shide questioned the defendants one by one and ordered them to be handed over to the Kunshan County personnel to be taken back for investigation, along with the stolen goods.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Why This Treatment of Koreans? <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Recently, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred in Shanghai. The kidnapped victim was Li Chunshan, a Korean independence party leader who had become a naturalized Chinese citizen. The kidnappers were "short bandits" who used a "black-plated car." Although the truth has not yet been fully revealed, if we are not forgetful, we can recall the political kidnapping cases in the French Concession after the "January 28th Incident" as a comparison. The significance is far greater than the assault of a few foreign monks, nor is it limited to the kidnapping of a millionaire. It directly concerns our national system.</p>
<p>According to Li, he moved from the French Concession to the Nanshi area for "security reasons." Unfortunately, this "precaution" was a mistake. One should seek security within the walls of the strong. All we have to offer is "apologies." Although we are very conscientious towards the nationals of belligerent countries—probably out of the lingering sentiment of "not capturing the two old men"—as for naturalized citizens, well, we can't even manage our own people. Those who are bullied abroad are bullied by their own people at home. What does it matter if these "brothers" of the same ancestry but different nationality suffer?</p>
<p>Based on Li's accomplishments in Korea, he may have hopes of being called a "national father" in the future, but he is not as fortunate as our "national father." Sun Yat-sen also suffered in London! A memorial is still in place, but he eventually gained freedom. What about Li? He has been kidnapped for four or five days, and his whereabouts are still unknown. He may have been sent to a prison thousands of miles away. The actions are similar, but the results are different. The only difference is that Shanghai is not London, and the ghostly tricks of the X country are far superior to those of the Manchu government.</p>
<p>Now that the incident has occurred, it cannot be denied that the authorities' protection was insufficient, such as the scarcity of police posts. However, this trend cannot be allowed to continue. For the safety of naturalized citizens and to restore national prestige, the authorities must bring the culprits to justice in the shortest possible time, or at least tell us the reason why they cannot be brought to justice.</p>

<p>— Deng Niukun</p>
<p>Red calamities everywhere have not yet recovered, heavy rains in Jiangcheng urge for taxes, the people's livelihood is used to being like catkins in the wind, turning into snow and drifting like duckweed.</p>
<p>I once heard of the dwarfed invaders looting the rivers and mountains, the men of the Northeast surrounding themselves with knives, even if their neck blood cannot return an inch of land, they have left righteousness in the world.</p>
<p>Last night, the wind and rain often startled the vines, Chengde inexplicably reported the loss of the city, where have the tens of thousands of brave soldiers gone, Zhang Qing of Tianjin and Ping lay high and unconcerned.</p>
<p>Why execute Yu Lin for the lost land, the golden Northeast is abandoned like a mat, the broken walls of Jiangnan are still there today, it is possible to move troops to be neighbors.</p>
<p>The national decree has not been enforced for many years, there has never been law before the military, now that we feel the danger of doom, both jade and stone will be burned together, how can the tiles be spared.</p>

<p>— Binfu</p>
<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. My older brother and I were planning to take my nephew, Rongshu, to the Great World. Because my older brother was moving, my sisters-in-law were busy packing, filling the room with dark, useless things. We felt extremely annoyed, and Rongshu's shouting interfered with their work, so we decided to go to the Great World. As soon as the decision was made, Rongshu was overjoyed. Suddenly, the neighbor downstairs announced that a female guest wanted to see me. I responded and ran downstairs. At the top of the stairs, I saw a woman from the dark light, already reaching out and across two steps of the stairs. To identify the guest and to prevent my guest from falling in the dark, I turned around and immediately turned on the light. Unexpectedly, the face of the middle-aged woman that came from the electric light still did not seem familiar to me, but the unfamiliar and smiling face had already safely come to my front, and greeted me cordially, "Mr. Feng doesn't recognize me, does he?"</p>
<p>I desperately concentrated my brainpower and carefully looked at her whole body. Her hair was thick, her face was oval, her cheekbones were high, her cheongsam was made of green Indian satin, and her accent was from Shaoxing. Who is this?</p>
<p>"Yes, I can't remember! Haha"</p>
<p>"I'm SW's sister. Have you forgotten the night you came to my house?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, yes. My memory is really bad." Only then did I realize that we had been standing there for a long time, so I quickly found a chair in the mess of boxes and asked her to sit down apologetically.</p>
<p>looked over, but she was caught by her sharp eyes, and called to sit on his lap, so the conversation shifted to her and Rongshu. As a result, Rongshu thought that the watch on her wrist was very beautiful and asked to take it off to play. I immediately forbade him, and he climbed down and returned to the inside room in disappointment.</p>
<p>"This child is really smart and lively. It's a pity that I'm in a hurry and didn't buy any food."</p>
<p>The conversation shifted back to SW, because SW was ultimately the link between me and this female guest.</p>
<p>"SW really knows how to spend money. The money he brought when school started has already been used up. He is not as frugal as you, Mr. Feng."</p>
<p>SW is my very good classmate. He is from Shaoxing. One night half a year ago, we were late for the train in Yuyao, and I went to his older sister's house with his sister-in-law, the bureau chief. His older sister treated us very kindly. However, the older sister I saw under the kerosene lamp at that time was somewhat vague in my memory. My heart was filled with the shame of not being a good host, and I really didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>It was the capable her who spoke first; "I went to see my younger brother today, and his stomach problems have flared up again. He is lying in bed, so he couldn't come to see you with me." The reply was just a low "Yes, yes, yes." I really couldn't think of anything to say.</p>
<p>"I came from Suzhou last night, and I went to the school in Wusong early in the morning to see my younger brother, but unexpectedly he fell ill again. This person's health is really not good, and being a guest in a foreign land makes people very worried. Mr. Feng, your health seems to be very good."</p>
<p>As I paced in circles, I peeked through the side door at my older brother and the others who were waiting. At this time, Rongshu had come to ask several times. My older brother knew that this female guest intended to "talk for a long time," so he took off his hat that he had put on.</p>
<p>The conversation was silent for a while, and Rongshu came to make trouble again. I was a little confused by this unexpected praise.</p>
<p>"I came to Shanghai from Yuyao the day before yesterday, and I went to Suzhou yesterday, because he is now doing a job in Suzhou. Unexpectedly, he had just been transferred to Hangzhou when I arrived in Suzhou. I had to stay in a hotel in Suzhou overnight, planning to transfer to Hangzhou from Shanghai this morning, but..." Her words suddenly stopped, and just as I was about to ask, her words burst out again.</p>
<p>"Anyway, you are my younger brother's old friend, so it doesn't hurt to say it. You know that my travel bag was not very full to begin with. After this unexpected delay, I completely ran out of money. I was going to go to my younger brother to get the money when I arrived in Shanghai, but unexpectedly he didn't have a penny either. Aren't you angry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he probably bought books. Foreign books are really expensive now." I explained for my friend.</p>
<p>"That's right, so he told me your address and asked me to borrow from you temporarily. After I arrive in Hangzhou, I will send it back to you immediately, and I also want to send some to my younger brother."</p>
<p>"Very good, very good. How much?"</p>
<p>"OnlyhvoDollarsl!" This sound is</p>
