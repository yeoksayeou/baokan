<h3>日軍向察邊出動聯合張海鵬部圖奪多倫沽源</h3>
<p>宣化附近被毁鐵橋已修復東行車誤點二十小時到平</p>
<h3>平張間空氣漸緊張</h3>
<p>（北平）日軍平賀旅團及茂木旅團、已向察邊出動、聯合僞軍張海鵬部、共有二萬餘、目的在奪多倫沽源、（十九日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）馮部最近在懷來縣境内徵發小米六十五萬斤、白麫二十二萬斤、方部將辛莊子站附近一零四號橋枕木軌道完全折毁、應於昨下午三時半到平之二次車在張垣西即誤點、到該處時即不能前行、昨由平開出之平包通車、亦止懷來、嗣路方當於昨夜派工前往修理、一零四號橋至今晨一時半完全修復、平包車當即西開、今晨已過宣化前行、二次車亦於今午抵平、誤點二十小時、（十九日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）馮請求當當局覆電一節、此間已决置之不理、（十九日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）馮兵炸毁之路橋雖已修復、火車亦復通行、但緊張之空氣卒未稍減、各方面之調解人今日第一次承認已無能爲力、華人各界咸謂戰事之發生、僅屬時間問題、聞馮宣稱、如果開戰、則渠能堅守張口一月之久、一般人士對孫殿英之態度、頗多猜測、孫軍現仍駐於平綏鐵路一帶、候車開往包頭、俾進赴靑海、衆恐孫軍一經開拔、馮與中央之戰事即將發作、蓋孫軍現成兩軍間之緩衝物也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）馮玉祥拆毁平綏路鐵橋以防北平軍隊前進、其意完全爲挑戰之態度、迄今馮氏均以抗日名義相號召、但拆橋之舉、已揭開馮氏反抗中央之態度、故中央將以叛逆目之、官方頃發表公報謂、馮氏並未眞正克復多倫、但係當地駐軍自動反正、故當時並未放一槍即拔一城、至於馮氏謂陣亡一千六百人、傷三百人之說、官方認爲絕對無稽、現時馮之地位、頗爲困難、據可恃方面之消息、除非馮氏自動放棄多倫、否則「滿」軍將進兵奪取之、並及其附近各地、據某當局稱、北平當局以勸吿俱屬失敗、遂有不得不採取武力之勢、又稱馮氏欲籍抗日之名、而行叛逆之實同時又復盡力宣傳、以博人民之同情云、馮氏似不久即將被解决、除投誠外、即須退入沙漠地帶、但以馮之個性觀之、彼或將退入沙漠也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>汪院長談察省收編僞軍</h3>
<p>（南京）關於察哈爾收編僞軍問題、外間多不明眞相、中央社記者、今午特訪謁行政院汪院長、叩以究竟、承汪院長詳爲答覆、茲錄汪院長談話如下、昨日我回覆李任潮、陳眞如兩先生的電報、今晨報上已經登載、全個關於察哈爾收編僞軍的事情、尚未詳盡披露、自熱河失陷以來、許多軍隊陸續由熱河退至察哈爾境内、這些軍隊裏頭、有些是義勇軍由東三省退至熱河、更由熱河退至察哈爾的、也有些是土匪、更有些是打着僞軍的旗號的、軍事委員會、本已擬妥辦法、分别處理、眞的義勇軍改爲正式軍隊、土匪便須解除武裝、僞軍更當設法解决、及至馮先生到察哈爾以後、不分皂白、一律收編、以爲多多益善、其實眞是後患無窮、最近宣傳收復多倫、聲勢因之更盛、收復多倫、誠然一件好事、但多倫方面本無日本軍隊駐守、僅有僞國收編原來熱軍崔興武之殘部李守忠部約二千餘人、所以馮先生派人一經接洽、一部分便服從改編了、一部分係站脚不住了、而吉鴻昌率鄧文李忠義等部、便進駐多倫了、我們應該明瞭、現在失地之不能收回、並不是因爲有僞軍存在的原故、假若因爲多倫地方收編了或驅逐了若干僞軍、便以爲可以收復失地、這眞是太輕視天下事、而在長城戰死的幾萬戰士、在地下也要流涙了、這種虚驕幼稚的心理、在過去已誤事不少、以後更應引爲嚴戒、這在昨日覆電已經說明、現在更進一步討論收編僞軍、是不是一種好的方法呢、我可斷言其不是爲好方法、第一、這些僞軍是毫無主義而完全以利害爲去留的標準、可以忽然掮着抗日的招牌、而受日人卵翼、也可以忽然打着僞國的旗幟、而向我接洽歸誠、眞所謂飢則依人飽則颺去、今日受了收編、這塊失地似乎是收回了、明日翻了臉、這塊失地又依然仍非我有、第二、僞軍是無窮無盡的、國家有限的財力、人民有限的脂膏·如何能盡養他們、况且收容的數額愈多、他們愈可以自重、事事反賓爲主、魚肉地方、蹂躪人民、無惡不作、稍加制裁、便隨時可以背叛、所以我認爲收編僞軍、是應該愼而又愼、切不可掉以輕心的、在這裏我又聯想到灤東方面了、灤東的接收戰地問題、直待至停戰恊定成立一個多月以後、方纔有决定的辦法者、正因爲極端愼重、以免貽患將來的原故、所以寗可受不明内容者之指摘猜疑唾駡、而决不肯隨便敷衍、其實在過去的一個多月的時日之中、對於這個問題、無時不在苦心積慮之間的、當初灤東一帶的僞軍要求收編的數目有四萬人之多、北平軍分會和政委會、顧慮到將來人民負担地方的治安種種關係、予以嚴格的减削、經過若干度的磋商、經由四萬而三萬而兩萬、最後竟减至四千、只及原額十分之一、對於改編及遣散的經費、也予以極嚴的减削、比要求原額相差甚遠、接收遲緩的主因、實在於此、現在辦法已定、自可於最短時期内、迎刀而解了、若是也照察哈爾方面辦法、來五千編五千來一萬編一萬、那麽也不必待至今日了、然而收編下來的這許多軍隊、怎麽善後呢、若無善後的方法、其結果徒有收回之名、無收回之實、將來後患眞是不堪設想、所以多倫與灤東、雖然是同樣收回、而其結果則不大相同的、所以我們現在對於察哈爾問題、固慮其足以召外兵失國土、尤慮其以邊疆貧瘠之區、養十幾萬蹂雜之衆、一旦餉糈不繼、地圖上察哈爾全省的顏色、便會隨這十幾萬人的心理而變化、心所謂危、不不敢吿還望國人於此注意（十九日</p>

<p>（倫敦）經濟大會方面預料如主要國家對於重大問題不能有一般諒解、則世界經濟大會未必復開、極關重要之外交談話、將在秋間舉行、今大會雖未達到樂觀派之大希望、但各種不同的意見之交換、已開闢將來討論之途徑、銀議案爲一般人所歡迎、認爲大會貨幣方面之唯一的具體提議、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>白銀組通過决議案</h3>
<p>（倫敦）畢德門國際管理白銀之努力、現已失敗、銀股員會已通過一議案、贊成多用銀爲通幣、並主張限制白銀出賣問題、由出產國討論之、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟會議貨幣委員會銀問題股員會、一致通過一種决議案、其建議（一）主要產銀國與存銀及用鉅額白銀之國</p>
<p>、設法成立妥恊、（二）立法手續足以使銀準備價値重行跌落至千分之八百以下者、各國政府不當予以採取、（三）各國政府當在可能範圍内、用銀幣代替紙幣之用、上項建議亦有例外、即在第一欵所規定之妥恊、若於一九三四年四月一日尚未成立、則建議案均皆歸於無效、又無論如何有效期間、不得超過一九三八年一月一日以後、建議案又稱、遇有銀幣成色在銀市上價値超出幣面價値之時、爲避免窖藏與銷毁起見、各國政府對於鼓鑄銀幣自可自由伸縮云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日情形、似金本位國刻正企圖在經濟會議休假以前、阻撓會中成立一種白銀恊定而加以簽證、美代表畢德門旣與荷英商妥第四次修改所擬决議草案後、今日復有意代表出而阻撓、提出一新决議案、要求加以討論、聞其内容與畢德門所認爲恢復銀價之必要條件、相去甚遠、據美代表意見、意人此案將使局勢益見複雜、足以延滯成立恊定日期、又據可靠消息、關於白銀問題、並未有恊定草案曾經簽證第一字母云（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>商債組起草會結束</h3>
<p>煞費唇舌草定决議案</p>
<p>僅就債務作籠統規定</p>
<p>（倫敦）經濟會議討論商債問題之起草委員會、今日下午經長時間討論之後、業已結束、當討論時、德國中央銀行總裁沙赫特發言數次、惹起糾紛、其最要者、爲商債問題股員會所通過之條文、沙赫特以此項條文此時發表、未免過早、起草委員會旋將法英意羅馬尼亞四國代表所擬之决議草案略加修改、予以通過、此項决議案乃維持債權人與債務人之平衡者、</p>
<p>（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）商債小組委員會之起草委員經數星期之討論、已商得同意、如經濟會議召集大會即將提出决議案、建議債務者當盡力籌還債務、必至萬不得已時、始可由債權者與債務者間直接磋商整理債務、而此時當以債務者之償付能力爲根據、蓋此項决議案、僅就債務問題本身作一籠統之規定、所有與國際商債有關之其他問題、幾完全删除、故委員會信大會將可在原則上通過此案、而法代表某君亦於决議案草竣後聲稱、就渠所知、此不過通常所用之解决債務方法而已、雖然即此泛泛數語之普通方法、亦幾經討論而後定議、有時且起猛烈之舌戰、據聞曾有數國代表企圖將商債與其他問題、尤其與貨幣安定問題牽涉一起、更有企圖提出政府間債務問題者但美代表因恐引起戰債、竭力反對、嗣遂作罷、並在决議案末節切實聲明、政府間債務在世界經濟會議討論範圍以外云（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>西半球糖會議决裂</h3>
<p>古巴要求减稅遭美拒絕</p>
<p>（華盛頓）企圖减少西半球糖產與安定糖價之美洲糖會議、實際等於决裂、而倫敦經濟會議中對於糖產亦未能商得同意、因此糖已成美政府當前嚴重問題之一、臨時政務會議將考慮今後有無以國内產糖者、列入普通實業營業章程、而對於古巴聽任自然之可能性、按美洲糖會議、目的在减少美國本部與屬島及古巴之糖產、但古巴產糖者在最後一分鐘、仍堅持美國對於古巴糖進口稅、當自每磅二仙减爲一仙、此外一切外國糖仍照現行稅率、以爲古巴减少糖產之交換、但美國產糖者因古巴產糖者享工價低廉之利益、减稅後將致古巴糖可以完全控制美市塲、故拒絕其請、古巴代表遂以不願繼續爲要挾、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美洲糖會議業於今日决裂、古巴代表已啓程回國、僅留一代表在七華盛頓報吿今後新談判消息、今日舉行最後會議時、古巴表示願于加入减種恊定、但不願將現有巨額存糖封存不銷、並堅持古巴下季减種百分之五十後、美國對古巴糖進口稅亦當减輕一半、但美菲糖業俱未允其請、聞倫敦方面亦以同樣原因致暫吿停頓、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）日外務省欲藉石井代表在歐洲各國之人望、决定電命石井代表歸國時、沿路歷訪歐洲各大國遊說三大綱（一）日本原來不願退出國聯、因其大陸政策不能見諒於國聯之政治家、貴代表須備述日方之苦衷、求各國之諒解、（二）日本雖退出國聯、但對各國仍切望和好如故、希各國勿因退出國聯而對日改變其原有政策、（三）日本對滿政策决不能變更、其他之通商問題、甚願與各國新訂互惠條約、（十九日華聯電）</p>

<h3>經濟會議失敗癥結所在</h3>
<p>（南京）某外交家十九日語中央社記者、世界經濟會議因利害不能一致、卒吿失敗、其夭折之癥結點、即在用金國問之衝突、美刻正從事通貨膨脤、以謀提高物價、繁榮國際貿易、使法深受痛苦、過去英美間亦遭遇同樣事實、卒迫英與美共棄金本位、今美法間衝突、是否可由小組會議以謀緩衝、或竟迫使法國抛棄金本位、此時尚難逆料、但將來終有重趨合作之可能云（十九日中央社電）</p>
<h3>經濟會促成蘇俄外交成功</h3>
<p>帝國主義矛盾益深刻化</p>
<p>丨俄報爲大會總結賬丨</p>
<p>（莫斯科）共產黨言論機關眞理報、在檢討世界經濟會議之成果時、謂此項會議行將壽終正寢、而曾未絲毫解决基本問題也、該報復稱、唯此會議亦有其結果、即歐州債務團與美國、在戰債問題上之爭鬥突轉嚴重、而國際金融衝突亦吿擴張是也、同時會議又促成各帝國主義國家間關稅戰爭之發展、並加深對於黃金儲藏·價格固定·及市塲與原料來源之再分割等問題之傾軋、眞理報續</p>
<p>謂、唯蘇聯得有若干具體之成就、如取消英國對蘇聯入口貨之抵制、及簽訂包含蘇聯所作侵略國定義之公約是、該報結語謂、倫敦會議之第一塲、僅產生資本主義世界務盾之深化、實至顯然也、（十八日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>僞組織開始奪取中東路乎</h3>
<p>僞交通部鐵道司長赴哈爾濱</p>
<p>由理事會要求更换蘇俄幹部</p>
<p>（長春）「滿洲國」交通部鐵道司長森田成元、十九日自長春赴哈爾濱、謀改革中東路之内部、即欲獲得俄滿共同、管理之實權、蓋「滿洲國」鑒於東京之中、東路買賣交涉、因蘇俄方面之價格及所、有權之主張而停頓、由尊重中東路共管財產精神之見地、决斷然行使實力、排除蘇俄、由理事會要求更迭蘇俄幹部、根本矯正命令系統、並以積極態度出之、對蘇俄從業員爲對抗的罷工或暴動行爲、亦有充分之準備、（十九日電通電）</p>
<p>（長春）「滿洲國」政府對於中東路之買收問題、以爲無付貴價無理買收之必要、已命代表團以此方針進行交涉、同時任命阪谷總務司長爲連絡員、「滿洲國政府」現正進行準備將於萬一交涉决裂之時、對於中東路赤化職員之宣傳行爲行使主　權、加以峻嚴彈壓、東路交涉如决裂、俄滿關係將必尖銳化、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）蘇俄代表對於中東路出賣問題、表示誠意、最近尤顯著、俄方關於減少其賣價二萬五千萬金盧布方法、絕對反對採用從前日俄漁塲恊定時之製作金盧布行市恊定之辦法、始終維持金盧布之單位、擬僅減低其數目、然現在俄滿兩方主張之價格相差甚遠、非由俄方接近滿洲方面之五千萬元說、難望圓滿解决、衆料交涉前途尚多曲折、（十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據俄報載、最近有若干中東路俄籍職員辭職、其原因如下、（一）因大部份之俄籍職員在鐵路工作、均有二十餘年、按諸鐵路章程、應得養老金、故均提辭呈、俾領取養老金、（二）彼等亟願與鐵路脫離關係、俾他日不致被逼退回俄境云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>文化水準與圖書館化</h3>
<p>本月六日路透社莫斯科電訊云。「此間之列寗公共圖書館。現成爲世界上第一大圖書館。據當局之公佈。内中藏書五百萬卷····。又云。「依照華盛頓國會圖書館之編纂統計。謂英國陳述館列全世界最大圖書館之第六位。現將世界各大圖書館所藏之書記錄如下。列寗公共圖書館四百八十三萬二千九百四十八卷。華盛頓國會圖書館四百四十七萬七千四百三十一卷。巴憊國家圖書館四百萬卷。紐約公共圖書館三百四十七萬六千九百七十一卷。英國陳述館三百二十萬卷。柏林圖書館二百二十八萬七千八百二十一卷。波利圖書館一百二十五萬卷。」吾人閱此。感觸至多。</p>
<p>第一·今之論者。每謂資本主義爲文明先進。資本主義之動搖。即無異於人類文明之禍殃。甚且謂資本主義社會爲一永久不渝之人類組織。意即謂爲人類文明之最高表現。即如以圖書館所藏圖書爲標準。亦已足以表現資本主義文代之祟高無涯。美國圖書館之甲於天下。尤爲一般人所津津樂道。然而今日之列寗圖書館。春收藏宏富。已駸駸乎凌駕美國而上之。華盛頓圖書館。且退居第二位。由是可覘知社會主義文代發展之迅速。正與資本主義國家並駕齊驅。或且過之而無不及。則將來資本主義是否即爲人類文明之最高表理。目前尚爲一大問題。</p>
<p>第二·資本主義各國之圖書館。藏書雖富。食其賜者大都爲極少數人。而於大多數人無與。若蘇聯之圖書館。其目的在於提高一般平民文化嘗聞游歷蘇聯回國者云。在沙皇時代。圖書館爲士大夫與貴婦人消遣談天之所。今之到館讀者。類多爲一般平民。「高岸爲谷。深谷爲陵。」人事變遷。亦如是歟。　　我國固號稱爲文化最古之國。然而至於今日。舉國之内。竟無一規模較爲宏大之民衆圖書館。負推進文化之責者。方且從古紙堆中。作保存固有文化之運動。其實所謂復古。即無異於開歷史之倒車。固有者未必能保而新者又無從啓發。吾國今日應何如推進文化。以如何標準推進文化。此則負提倡之責者。所亟應考慮者也。</p>

<h3>沈鴻烈悄然離靑情形</h3>
<p>市民大會緊急議决挽留</p>
<p>沈氏係經烟臺乘船赴津</p>
<p>靑島通訊、海軍司令兼靑島市長沈鴻烈、自渤艦事變後、即迭電中央堅辭本兼各職、雖經院會疊電慰留、各方熱烈勸挽、而辭意卒未打消、適沈因國貨展覽會與華北運動會在靑舉行、且係本人任内重要事務、未便中途而輟、故未即行去職、刻華北運動會已散會、國貨展覽會亦已開幕多日、沈以任務終了、遂於十七日晨</p>
<p>四時、乘汽車秘密離靑、沈氏行時、即其親近屬員、亦少有知者、蓋因市民大會議决案中、有一案係於必要時派人赴車站碼頭、攀轅挽留、沈爲免去麻煩起見、故潛行離靑也、惟沈於行前、已向市府所屬各機關首領露堅决去職之意、因此各局長凡係受沈委任者、均願與沈同進退、並同上辭呈、業經沈照准、沈臨行時、條諭政務交由秘書長胡家鳳代理、在胡未返靑前、（胡前奉蔣委員長電召往贛埀詢海軍事變眞相刻尚未回）由市府參事周家彥暫代、現靑市軍政、雖均有人負責、照舊維持、但市民仍思挽留沈氏、故市民大會主席團代表、特於今日（十八）上午十時、在市商會開緊急會議、討論挽留沈氏第二步辦法、到有主席團及各法團代表五十餘人、主席宋雨亭報吿沈氏離靑經過、並謂刻據私人方面消息、沈市長確已抵威海衛、爲徐專員挽住、本會應如何進行、請大家討論、一時議論紛紛、有主張罷市以示挽沈决心者、有主張根據市民大會議决案第二項、（必要時援照中山縣民選縣長前例請中央政府准許地方民選市長）再開市民大會、選舉市長者、僉認以上兩主張、或有困難、或時機至、未暫且保留、最後議决兩項、（一）電請蔣委員長·汪院長·黃委員長、懇予始終俯准慰留、並電威海商會請就近極力攀留、（二）推宋雨亭·王仰先·張玉田·鄧洗元·張樂古·姚仲拔·郭金南·李漣溪·朱文彬·蘇劻臣·牟紹周·傅炳昭·劉衡三·朱子衡·劉子儒·陳瑾三等二十餘人、赴威海挽留、該代表等定於明早（十九）三時、分乘汽車六輛、直接前往、各案議决後、乃宣吿散會、（十八日）</p>

<p>又膠濟路委員崔士傑、今日亦由靑島到濟、當與張·王·何·三廳長到省府向韓報吿沈鴻烈離靑經過、又據省主席韓復榘談、沈氏由靑出走時、曾來一電、吿以辭職苦衷、决心去靑、本擬復電挽留、但計時已不及、今接烟臺公安局長張奎文電報、沈已乘汽車抵烟、旋又乘船赴津、現余已去電挽留、並已電請中央明令挽留、以免濱海咽喉之靑島、陷於搖動恐慌中云云、（七月十八日）</p>
<h3>編組僞軍辦法大體確定</h3>
<p>本報特派記者堯日</p>
<p>保安隊一總隊鄭燕侯任隊長特務隊一大隊歸總隊長統率日人暗中嗾使僞軍把持政權石友三在秦島組織僞軍近况</p>
<p>唐山通信、僞救國軍前敵司令鄭燕侯、向李際春兩度辭職、鄭部各旅長亦表示與鄭同進退、昨日（十五日）之編遺問題、幾陷僵局、薛之珩雷壽榮昨日下午二時、赴僞總司令部晤李、磋商補救辦法、日本關東軍代表喜多大佐亦參加、均勸鄭不可辭職、實則鄭係嫌大隊長之職太小、故以辭職爲要挾、但磋商結果、遂變更辦法、祗編組戰區保安隊一個總隊、以鄭爲總隊長、下設兩個大隊、十二個中隊、三十六個分隊、共三千人、另組特務隊一大隊、下分兩個中隊、十二個分隊、共一千人、亦歸總隊長統率指揮、如此、則大權集於一人之手、自可躊躇滿志、鄭睧態度、遂趨緩和、薛等之商洽、直至今（十六）晨二時始散、上午九時、薛之珩再到僞總司令部訪李、繼續商洽、下午三時半始散、當地各界、恐鄭辭職後搗亂、亦正聯名上呈僞總部挽留、故今日情勢漸佳、聞候編遣費匯到、即開始點編、據個中人談、鄭燕侯去年七月間、始赴錦州投效李氏、碌碌半載、無所建樹、鄭性勇暴不怕死、今春榆關淪陷、繼以熱河不守、李氏向關内發展、李初未料東北軍聞風披靡、一槍不放、所以當時利用鄭之勇暴、委以前敵司令官、使之攻的要頭陣、鄭得此機會、奮勇向前、並招降何柱國部趙雷一營、更在灤河以東、檢獲東北軍遺棄械彈甚夥、勢力大爲充實、從而漸露驕色、凡事自作主張、目無李氏、渡過灤河後、李已感覺無法控制鄭氏矣、</p>
<p>李際春之僞軍、額數究竟若干、在事實上、不但李本人不明瞭、即鄭燕侯李秀崑二人亦不十分了解、因一年以來、從未點名、僅憑旅團長隨便報吿、無從查考、據僞軍中透出確實消息、李氏直接指揮之四個梯隊、人數不過二千、槍械不足一千、鄭燕侯部、人數不過四千、槍械則有三千、此次要求改編、竟報稱一萬二千人、意在多領編遣費、以飽私囊而已、現在各旅團之花名淸册、尚未編造完竣、李軍佔領灤東灤西十餘縣後、即委劉錦標爲僞政務廳長、於五月二十六日在秦皇島成立僞政務廳賆管轄各縣行政稅務、該廳不設於唐山、而設在秦皇島、自然庽有深意、據深悉僞軍内幕者談、日人自塘沽恊定簽字後、即向僞軍施以麻醉工作、嗾使把持政權、現在此種工作、漸著成效、鄭燕侯以辭職反對編遣、亦含有麻醉劑發酵之成分、留錦標在秦皇島之政務廳工作、依然照常辦事、毫無結束之意、將來僞軍改編竣事、省府接收各縣政權時、恐怕豐潤·樂亭·灤縣·遷安·盧龍·臨榆等縣、必有問題、聞李已向薛之珩雷壽榮表示、擬荐任私人充任上述各縣縣長、由省府加委、薛雷等以爲祗負編遣責任、不願牽涉政治事件、而使編遣問題、增加糾紛、僅允將此意向接收戰區委員會報吿、所以依照目前情况觀測、編遣問題、縱能委曲求全、將來灤河東西各縣之接收、仍必發生枝節、即或運用政治手腕、勉强接收、各行政人員、如不聽僞軍之驅策必被驅走、故前途尚多悲觀也、</p>
<p>至秦皇島方面之石友三、其僞名目爲保安救國軍、據李際春之秘書長温繼續談稱、此間對於石之企圖、亦不甚明瞭、僅知其幹部學校有一千餘人、衛隊團一千餘人、日人大橋爲之奔走策劃、上月由日方撥到步槍五百枝、石僅領得二百五十支、不知何故、日前石派人來唐謁李、表示與李合作、李因刻已進行縮編、正苦人多、不易安排、對石要求合作、已婉辭謝絕、另有一說、石之幹部學校、本年年底畢業、在此靑紗幛起時期、收撫關外各地土匪、由日本關東軍予以援助、萬一石氏在秦皇島不能存立、即移至遼熱邊界、此二說未知孰是耳、（七月十六日）</p>

<h3>草地網球聯賽中華穩得錦標</h3>
<p>昨日中華十二比三勝斜橋</p>
<p>下次中華即使全軍覆沒與錦標亦無關係</p>
<p>上海西人草地網球會之聯合比賽、開賽迄今、將於下星期三結束、昨日舉行第七次比賽、中華會又以十二比三大勝斜橋總會、同時足與中華會分庭抗禮、競奪錦標者、爲日本内外紗廠、但昨日内外廠竟以五與十之比、爲北草地所敗、於是内外廠之希望遂絕、而中華會則穩坐第一次之盟主矣、</p>
<h3>昨日四塲結果</h3>

<h3>中華穩得錦標</h3>
<p>草地聯賽錦標、中華至今未曾嘗試、每年皆有冠軍希望、輒因精神不能始終貫注、致功虧一簀、近三年錦標、均屬日本會、今年該會實力、因分散於内外廠、乃一　不振、而内外廠之實力、忽然强勁、遂爲中華會之勁敵、而中華之人材、以今年最爲齊整、故抱有必勝之决心、每戰皆捷、希望迭增、昨日中華以十二比三勝斜橋會後、錦標希望遂穩、加以内外廠之敗北益使中華穩取寶座矣、</p>

<h3>夏令足球聯賽取消</h3>
<p>棒球聯賽亦未成功</p>
<p>去年夏季中華全國體育恊進會爲提高冬令足球技術、並使足球運動益爲普及起見、曾發起舉行夏令足球比赛加入者甚多、每於夕陽西下、晚風徐來之際、分庭抗禮、球員與觀衆、其興趣不减冬令、最後决賽、嶺南隊奪得錦標、華東公司隊以一球慘敗、體恊會之計劃、以後原擬於每年夏令、繼續舉行、故時至今夏、各方球隊、均在準備、擬在夏令賽中、一顯身手、但全國體育恊進會今年改變宗旨、鑒於海上棒球運動、勢將淘汰、爲此擬作整興棒球之計、當初曾與交通復旦約翰等大學棒球隊接洽、擬發起棒球聯合比賽、特將棒球塲一面看台及鉛絲網拆除、準備棒球比賽之用、但自各校暑期放假後、球員星散、不能集合、於是棒球比賽、遂無形作罷、但球塲看台及鉛絲網旣已拆去、欲再裝修、所費不貲、是以今年之夏令足球比賽、不得不作罷矣、</p>

<h3>海上點綴品</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>有人說··我們貴國的海軍，自甲午戰後，早已折喪殆盡。現在所有的噸數，也爲數無幾。和世界各大國的海軍比較起來，眞好算「具體而徵」「相形見絀」。「攘外」旣感實力不足，「安内」又苦無用武之地。平日除了「放禮砲」「運　　」「供要人們乘坐」之外，簡直沒有多大用處。不過游弋海面，聯做「點綴品」而已。</p>
<p>在下道··恐怕不見得吧！就是要做海上的點綴品，要點綴得像個樣兒，也不是容易的事。因爲我國的海岸線甚長，若要按步就班，層層佈置。那裡有這許多的艦隊，供你點綴。况且我國沿海和長江一帶；早有各國盛大的海軍，來代你佈防，代你點綴，用不着你自己費心。所以這「金魚式」的海軍，（外國人嘗譏我國海軍和金魚一樣。）只好做「中華民國」名義上的點綴品，實在還　不上「海上點綴品」的資格。</p>
<p>講到我國海軍的組織，派别各異。向來是獨樹一幟，大都不受中央調遣，這也是國家畸形的怪現狀。最近駐在「靑島」的「海圻」等三艦，因爲内部閙意見，忽然宣吿失踪。業已證明駛入「珠江」，受粤方的收編了。接着「大沽口」所泊的「楚豫」等三艦，又自由行動了。海軍這樣的善變，眞令人目眩神迷，莫明其妙。其實依我們小百姓的見解，任你變到東了好，變到西也好，好在都在中華民國範圍之内。但是給洋</p>
<p>大人瞧了，又要說這「金魚」游來游去，未免太覺自由，爲任何國所「望塵莫及」吧！</p>
<h3>黃浦江的夜景</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>曾立在瀕浦江海關的鐘樓上，抱着蒼茫的遐想，低頭瞧眼前如匹鍊的申江檸檬色的浪，被炙在晚秋的落照裏，旣染了明艶的淡紅，像胭脂流入水銀裏似的，帶有朦朧的睡態。漸漸起了江烟，織成一幅霧網，把大小船隻，都吞入夜之肚裏去。</p>
<p>然而不久，近水的燈火都疏星似的閃鑠起來。就是隔江的工廠，也一行一行掛着琥珀黃的遠燈，正如一襲黑絲絨的披肩上亮着媚笑的珠鑽，於是江心的波紋，重映於眸子似的電光裏又好像瞧出了碧琉璃中玉龍游戲的銀鱗。</p>
<p>雖然也有輪船的汽笛，打醒了水國的詩境，但龐大的鐵獸爬過以後，從它尾巴上怒湧起來的白色浪花，却如，龍爪那樣騰拏，又如千萬個白雁翻身的姿態。繼着又延長了從憤怒而逐漸降低下來的猛虎的長嘯，哀猿的悲啼，意識到自己走入深松的林裏，突然掠過了一陣暴雷雨前的狂風。</p>
<p>潮聲定後，依然恢復了沉靜的江面。月已高掛在藍碧的中天。月光平舖江上，電火失去了晶芒，眼前又換一個境界。藍天反映於水底，明月也照出了上下的淸影，兩重天兩顆月，中間隔一痕水　　曼妙而又輕盈；遠處近處，漂浮着舢板，少女或老婦，掏着雙櫓，在月明之夜替來去的客人渡江，伊們唱着故鄕的山歌。</p>
<p>當兵艦上的鈴鐸一時交響，江海關的大鐘，也吐出禮拜堂裏晚禱的鳴聲，就在這惑魅的音樂微笑中帶着迷惘的快感，把我的夢敲破。</p>
<h3>男女平等難</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>際茲二十世紀，歐風東漸，男女平等的聲浪，一天高似一天。任憑道學先生，皺緊了眉兒，嘆着氣數，但是，不相干，男子可做的事情，女子也得參加，男子去得的地方，女子豈可落後？這種男女平等的風氣已開，斷不是少數的道學先生，皺皺眉兒，嘆嘆氣數，所能挽回的了。</p>
<p>雖然，你瞧，世界上多多少少的男男女女，在生理上講，自古來這生兒養女的責任，上帝已派定了是女的來擔當。</p>
<p>做男的，在這二十世紀裏，任是科學昌明到怎樣的地步，這生兒養女的責任，不能向女的分任一點。</p>
<p>再如，在這炎熱的夏天，做男子的出外去，穿中裝的話，身上須得加上一件長長衫。如果穿西裝，那更受罪！厚厚的穿起了法蘭羢，頭上不論是中裝，或是西裝，還得戴上一隻草帽。因爲，不這樣打扮，覺得不體面，便要給人瞧不起。但是女子呢？那就簡單風凉得多了。伊們出外去，不但只穿了一件袒胸露臂，薄如蟬翼的紗製服裝就行，並且頭上旣可無須戴帽兒，脚上更可用不着穿襪子，十足顯露着豐富的曲線美，到處只</p>
<p>有受人的歡迎！至於到了冰冷的冬天，穿了皮大衣，和男子一塊兒逛游戲塲，上電影院，或是吃館子，伊們把大衣脫下時，做男子的須上前去接下。伊們要把大衣穿上時，做男子的須替伊們披上身去。</p>
<p>有時，做男子的坐在電車或是公共汽車裏，好端端的正坐得寫寫意意，忽然車子停了，上來一位摩登女子，並沒有向那位男子打招呼，可是，那男子見了伊，不由不肅然起立，恭而敬之的讓伊坐。據說··這是尊重女性（？），爲文明國人應知的禮貎。否則，便要給人目爲「壽頭」「阿木林」了。</p>
<p>唉！諸如此類，關乎男女不能平等的事實，　不　　　　　　　　　　　　　男女平等</p>
<h3>朱先生别傳</h3>
<p>— 任培初</p>
<p>健忘的我，把朱先生的··名字忘了；籍貫忘了；出身的學校忘了。總之，他是大學畢業生，丨是學士，丨很自負的人。當他從大學裏剛畢業的時候，他立志要在社會上找一個有出路的職位；而且月薪須在一百元以上。他得了學士文憑的第二天，便開始他找尋職位的工作。</p>
<p>不久，居然，被他找到一個洋行寫字</p>
<p>的位置。歡喜極了。這天，是行裏發薪水的一天。他估量自己的薪水。總在一百五十元以上，因爲他知道同事們的「學程」，一個都及不上他。然而希望和事實差得很遠，他領到的薪水，不過是五十元。這五十元的薪水，在普通一般人看來，的確是求之不得的進欵了。但在自負不凡的朱先生丨學士看來，似乎玷辱了他學士的身分。所以毅然和洋行脫離。</p>
<p>隔了好久，他又找到了一個百貨公司文牘的職位。他進去之後，便托一位老職員先去探聽經理的口風。結果，老職員很熱心的來報吿他··「了不得！經理特别優待你喲！每月給多三十番。」可是這位晦氣色蓋臉的朱先生丨學士，竟不屑幹拂袖而去。</p>
<p>朱先生丨學士的命運不佳，他自從丢了第二個職位之後，足足賦閒了五年。家裏的經濟，又因某種緣由而發生恐慌。他四處找人求薦，總算又得到一個小學敎員的位置，這次他不像從前那樣有奢望了，雖然薪水祗有二十元左右，但他沒有勇氣再丢了。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十一回俯首許婚姻芳情脈脈關心到士卒喜氣洋洋</p>
<p>拚了命來當兵，一年發半年的餉，至少要虧空二三十塊錢的債。那一班報館裏先生，提起筆來，就說中國的兵多而無用，回家養兵養窮了。其實這不怪兵。只怪老百姓窮得無出路，非當兵沒飯吃。而且國家並不會窮在哨窩頭的大兵身上，應當窮在住洋樓坐汽車的將官身上。他想到了這裏，我也是個軍官，比士兵舒服多了。我快要娶太太了，將來就有兒子，我得做好人。他由發過感慨之後，動了仁慈心了。他悄悄的向飯廳裏面看去，一個兵帶看一碗菜湯，一碗窩頭，滿地裏蹲着吃。（註，無桌椅。）心裏這又感動一下，無論那一種老百姓，除了呌化子而外，有這樣吃飯的嗎？當時走上樓去，見着王士立，就向他笑道··明大我拿出兩塊錢來，買幾十斤鹹菜給弟兄們吃，回頭怕我忘了，明天提我一聲兒。王士立答應着，心裏可就想，我們連長一高興起來，連弟兄們者有鹹菜吃了，眞是一人有福，帶好一屋。趙自强見王士立有笑容；一定是贊成自己這種主張，笑嘻嘻的道··我老早就是這樣想的了。不久的時候我還得請你吃喜酒呢。王士立這才明白了，連長這一程子，常談到娶太太的事，莫不是他眞要娶太太了。便笑道··你要娶太太了。那好。說着，有個胡排長來了。趙自强笑道··聽見沒有，我要娶媳婦了。人是眞不壞，今年二十一歲，粗細活全成。心眼兒比我靈活得多。（一三五）</p>

<h3>岑西林軼事</h3>
<p>— 鐵彌陀</p>
<p>西林先生之　，人多思之。予兒時隨宦兩粤，曾望見先生顏色，旌　車騎，塡溢城郭，忽忽猶若前日事。或有　先生之軼事者，益想念先生風　不置，記如下··中法諒山之役，已獲全勝，淸廷怵於馬　之　，　　媾和，將士多悲憤。唐景崧時以　卿在軍中，陰　陸阿宋，入佔越南之北。陸阿宋者</p>
<p>；陸榮廷之初名，出沒林葬間，法人　人，至是迭有斬獲。提督蘇元春部有統領馬盛治，與阿宋有舊，亦時有周給，勢益張，法以大兵臨之，皆遇覆敗，不得已，請我收撫，更　鉅金啗元春，阿宋遂隸蘇部，長一營，並約阿宋不得遷擢。迨先生開府兩粤，阿宋已易今名，知可大任，首擢爲邊防統領，並鎭左江，人以夙約爲懼，先生笑不答。法使果以違約抗問，勢洶洶，淸廷以詢，先生覆日·我國用人内政，外人何得問？且渠前約爲陸阿宋，今升擢之官則陸榮廷也，殆如風馬牛不相及，何得問？以示法使，使啞然，人多服公膽竊。</p>
<p>庚子之後，淸廷畏外賓如虎，疆吏則畏敎士如虎，　志遂多入敎爲護符。有天主敎士周懷仁者，法人也，設敎堂於粤西　州，主一省敎務。會兩粤會匪變起，巡撫王之春統兵駐潯進剿，匪多敎徒，之春捕之，懷仁往謁求釋，之春懼，如其請，張燕媚之，復給四品服，示優異，出入必中門迎送，於是民爭入敎，不旬日，數逾萬。先生劾之去，督師西上，亦駐節尋城，懷仁仍服我衣冠求見，先生知之審，欲痛挫折之，御黃馬褂，坐堂上，傳呼，懷仁大驚，不得已，越前長揖，先生問何人？懷仁以對，先生曰··奈何不下拜？曰··我外國敎士。先生曰··敎士固應抗禮，第汝中國衣冠，應如中國禮，我位一品，若四品，則屬吏也。朝制，屬吏見府主御黃馬褂，當下拜，今在軍中，得便宜行事，若不聞我奏准三品以下先斬後奏乎？言已，面鐵色。懷仁戰慄長跽，先生數之曰··傳敎應遵敎規，不得與外事，聞王撫時汝常庇匪人，今若此，不保首領矣。周唯唯遇，汗如洗，出轅門，遽褫衣冠擲地，詈王之春陷人不置，一時快之。</p>

<h3>國貨事業之新出路</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨事業，在今日之中國，已如日月經天，江河行地，人人知提倡，人人能服用，極暢行之能事。此次北行，所見所聞，如膠濟鐵路，如靑島，如烟台，如威海衛，均有國貨事業發展之新地位。華北前途，極有敎望。極盼南方國貨界放遠眼光，運用魄力，聯袂北行，闢一國貨事業之新生路。最近靑島威海衛之國貨展覽會，固不僅在開會期間之熱鬧已也。鄙意此後國貨界在展覽會期中，應行注意下列數點··</p>
<p>（一）調查工作凡當地之批發商或零售商，家數若干，每家業量若干，所進之貨來自何地，銷往何處，全市總數若干，目下最銷行之出品有幾種，當地人民購買力如何，對於出品之價格與花色有何意見，當地外貨之傾銷如何，俱應用縝密之工作，假以時日，澈底調查，作進展之參考。</p>
<p>吾謂到一地之展覽費，假定爲一千元，則調查費至少占二分之一，此爲最要工作，不容忽略。</p>
<p>（二）聯合營業在一地方如果一廠設一營業機關，不但開繳浩大，極不經濟，即顧客主面，亦覺接洽艱難，多數麻煩。當地如有國貨公司或國同組織，公舉經理，各派營業人員及熟於各幫事業之幹員，從事進行，一舉數得，最爲經濟，日後且有極大之功效。</p>
<p>（三）聯絡商號每到一地展覽，切勿任意跌價，傷壞當地商號之情感。應先事接洽，與之商定一切，並多方聯絡，結其情感，或售以貨物，或訂立合同，使各商號不但不受損害，反多利益，則各商號樂爲宣傳，願與交易，須知展覽之期短，而往來之日長。此爲最要問題，亦打開新出路之要訣也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>幾個小毛病</h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>丨願國貨製造者不要傳染丨</p>
<p>在次殖民地的中國，列强武力的侵略，是有形的；經濟的侵略，是無形的；有形的易防，無形的難防；因爲無形的經濟侵略，是「殺人不見血」的把戲。</p>
<p>爲防止「殺人不見血」的把戲，愈頑愈利害起見，於是有國貨運動，這，的確是避免經濟侵略的一劑起死回生的妙藥仙丹。</p>
<p>不過，中國人普遍有幾種小毛病，假使國貨製造者傳染了，足以阻碍國貨的進展，同時能夠斷送了整個的中國。現在特地寫在下面，以爲我親愛的國貨製造者　··</p>
<p>（一）虎頭蛇尾中國人做事，多數是虎頭蛇尾，起初如何如何的好，隨後就逐漸退步，假使國貨界傳染了這種毛病，出品的時候，品質如何的精良，裝璜如何的美麗，等到銷路暢旺，就會逐漸的退化，致使顧客不信任，這，直接關係本身之營業事小，間接阻碍國貨之進展實大，希望國貨界特别注意。</p>
<p>（二）魚目混珠，「眞」的反面是「假」</p>
<p>，有了「眞」的，就免不掉會有「假」的；中國人慣喜拿「假」的去混充「眞」的，只要欺騙過去就得了。國貨界千萬不要染了這毛病，尤其是不能拿劣貨，換粘國貨的商標，去欺騙國人。格外的不能拿劣貨的原料，製造國貨，間接把金錢輸出，接濟敵人。</p>
<p>（三）勝則驕傲凡事都有失敗與成功，成功者當然是快事，不過，愈是成功，愈應該努力於改進，使自己的出品達到盡善盡美的地步，不可因爲僥倖一時的成功而心滿意足，要知道··「驕則必敗」，這是古今不易的道理。</p>
<p>（四）敗則灰心成功果是樂事，失敗也是常事，「失敗是成功之母」，不有失敗，安有成功？失敗正足以促進我的努力，千萬不要因爲一時的失敗而灰心，而停止上進。</p>
<p>（五）同行妬嫉妬嫉心是人人有的，失敗者對於成功，慣會妬嫉，要知道··國貨界的同志們，人家的成功，間接就是我的成功，因爲大家都是爲國貨而努力，要「相見以誠」，「恊力同心」，聯合一條堅固的國貨戰線，去抵抗我們的仇人。</p>
<p>上面的五條，是想到那裏，說到那裏的，希望國貨界的同志們！努力於「有則改之，無則加勉」這兩句話。</p>

<p>靑島之國貨事業，有紗廠，有麵分廠，有棉織廠，而以石公司爲最新事業，記者日前以李祖模君之紹介，參觀靑島中國石公司，由董事方連壁姚作賓二君導觀。廠房均特建，製造悉用機器，所有出品，有數十種，以建築用家具用紀念用爲最多。各種石質而都細膩柔密均爲舶來品所不及。成立數個月，而營業額已有數十萬，其得各地主顧之歡迎，可想而知。據姚君言··上海四行儲蓄會二十二層大厦底層外部所用之飾石，即採用公司出品。日來各地來定貨者，尤踵趾相接，資本二十萬元，係有限公司性質，經理爲姚文蔚君。姚君言本公司所有出品，所以能暢銷各地者，一以建築上所用之石，每覺載重過甚，於建築上不甚適宜，本公司之石，旣切成薄片，大可减輕重量，極爲靈便。二以外貨關稅過重和價格較本公司出品貴出二倍以上，而質地尚覺不如。姚君言時，即以歐美各式石質，分别見示，並用硫酸爲試騐，醮在意大利石，即起泡沫，而醮在中國石，則絲毫不發生變化，可見能經風雨侵蝕永不變色者，該公司出品足以當之。</p>

<h3>「西崽哲學」</h3>
<p>— 古飛</p>
<p>友人K君，寄居在某白俄弄堂内的一家亭子間裡。那家的西崽（卽直譯的僕歐），是一位了不起的國粹主義者，譬如說，他雖然會說大英話，但他吿訴K君，「依然照鄕間的老規矩，一天兩頓飯」。一天兩頓飯並不爲奇，但他却根據的是「老規矩」，這種不忘國粹的做人的態度，當今之世，却非大大地奬勵不可的。</p>
<p>最近，因了鄕間的大水和騷動，這西崽底尖脚老婆帶着一個六七歲的男孩子跑到上海來了。上海的繁華雖然使孩子招駕不來，但孩子畢竟是孩子，不久就和鄰居的小伴侣們混在一塊了。然而，綠眼睛黃頭髮的小伴侣們，在玩的時候固然非常高興，但他們娘老子敎給他們的「上等種」和「上等人」的驕傲，一有機會就會馬上爆發出來，使這個小辮子，破襠褲，臉黑得和南洋土人一樣的生客狠狠地吃一頓被「懲罰」的苦。在這樣的時候，我們的西崽就爲難了；他不能不尊敬他底芳鄰，但他也愛他底小兒子········。</p>
<p>但他畢竟有他底辦法··不准那孩子出去。如果他發覺了在他不注意的時候，那孩子溜了出去的話，一定馬上去拖回來，一面駡，、「你去！你去！看他們不把你打死才好呢！」於是，他把那孩子關在小院子裏。有時那些洋娃兒們衝到小院子裡來玩的時候，他就把他捉進房子裏去。但如果那些洋娃兒們有一天衝到房裡來了呢？我想，他總有他底辦法的罷。</p>
<p>對於這位西崽底行動，友人K君取了一個名字，呌做··不抵抗主義的哲學。</p>
<p>但又有人說，不抵抗主義中國是「古已有之」的，當然可以列入第一等國粹裏去，但中國國粹的不抵抗主義並不是千年不變的，到現在已到了一個「大成」的時代。照一九三三年式的不抵抗主義辦，這位西崽僅僅把那孩子拖回來關起來是不夠的，他應當把小孩子底耳朶閉起來，使他「非禮勿聞，」把他底眼睛蒙起來，使他「非禮勿視」，而最重要的是塞住他底嘴·······。</p>
<p>如果這樣做了他還要溜出去的話，那顯然是一個搗亂胚子，那樣的兒子是「有不如無」的，應當治以「不孝罪」（用白話翻譯一下，就是··違犯父命罪），坐黑房子，打茨條子，活埋，剝皮·······。</p>
<h3>從裸體運動想到的話</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>記得前兩年初來上海時长許多江南的朋友一見面總會問··「聽說武漢常常舉行裸體遊行禾眞的嗎？好看吧」？這許多朋友所以這樣很感興趣地追問，我想一是由於他們覺得裸體遊行很「好看」，能看到那男男女女一絲不掛地成羣結隊</p>
<p>的遊行是有「眼福」的，也許他們還會想到我就是那裸體之羣中的一個；二是由於他們覺得武漢政府敢於舉行裸體遊行，敢於撤盡禮敎之大防，那眞是一羣發瘋的禽獸，倒台正是應該的。很可惜的據我所知，武漢政府當時就終始未曾舉行過一次裸體遊行，而我也就始終未曾飽過一次那樣的「眼福」，我曾誠懇地對他們解釋說那是沒有的事，是毫無根據的謠言，但他們始終是將信將疑。從上少到武漢，只有兩三天的路程，而且交通也還便利，然而當時一般人對於武漢的情形，隔閡得竟如不同星球，即是一個毫無使人置信的理由的謠言，也會使人深信而不疑，大家把武漢看做禽獸之邦，爲之「談虎色變」，於是武漢政府終於倒了，〔自然，當時武漢政府本身就是一大矛盾，一大洪爐，沒有可以穩定的理由，〕由此我們可以想見謠言的蠱惑力之大，更不得不佩服造謠者聰慧之不可及。</p>
<p>武漢政府坍台已經五六年了，大家對於那可怖的「禽獸之邦」似乎亦早已忘記，目前復古運動正提倡得起勁，北平曾禁止女人携牡犬，曾禁止稱小姐爲「密斯，一時頗有「文化復興」之槪，然而在上海，一般小姐與少奶奶之流，一到夏天，却非穿着蟬翼似的薄紗，全裸着兩腿，使冰雪肌膚，如霧裏廬山，隱若可見，才算得第一流的「摩登」，最近裸體運動之風，且已自香港傳來，時勢推移，也許從前武漢政府時代所不曾有過的裸體遊行，會見之於今日的上海，好在當今聖明，就令裸體遊行眞的實行，也决沒有人看做一椿什麽了不起的事，而認爲非坍台不可。</p>
<p>自然，我並不是反對裸體運動，我認爲男女兩性間的關係，本來就平常不過，而剝脫衣服使人體如像大自然一樣全體裸露，尤其是不値得驚奇的事，「聖人不死，大盜不止，」惟其一般人把兩性間的關係看得神秘，甚至把人體之某一部分也看得神秘，禮敎先生扳起面孔敎人「非禮勿動，非禮勿視，」於是文壇上才有專門描寫性愛以迎合靑年心理的作家，馬路的角落裏才有專門呌賣某種畫片的小癟三，而聰明的導演先生也常常以女人的大腿與妖媚的舞姿吸收觀衆，假如大家能把神秘化的平凡起來，則「見怪不怪其怪自敗」，兩性間一定要减却許多是非，减却許多罪惡。</p>
<p>我所感到的是現在離武漢政府時代已經有了五六年，而一般人造謠的智慧却並無所增長，直至今日，還有人在高喊「ＸＸ公妻呀，那是洪水猛獸呀，」嗚呼，聆此而不掩耳却走者幾希！</p>
<h3>致趙景深先生</h3>
<p>— 余慕陶</p>
<p>趙先生··今天看到你在自由談發表的文章，覺得自稱爲「濫好人」的你，實在有點有意糊塗了。首先，我覺得你的俏皮未免是東施。例如你來算我「大衆文藝」數年前的文帳，連把我的内容和題目都改成了「創作」，不曉得是不是爲了「暢」和「順」。誰讀了那期的大衆文藝，誰會曉得我那篇文章原是介紹美國幾位新興作家。我介紹了辛克萊和哥爾德等四位以後，便說因篇幅關係，以後有機會再介紹其他作家。你說我把新羣衆的作家一筆勾消。我問你是不是有意羅織，不然如安徒生專家的你且「包辦」世界</p>
<p>文壇的你，當沒有不曉得哥爾德就是新羣衆裏表表超羣的人物罷。我固然不敏，然而你的高明，我却有領略。例如去前年你在論翻譯時，給魯迅先生和茅盾先生所指謫的「牛乳路」的「不凡」，當不至等於東風之過馬耳。</p>
<p>其次，你在「微音月刋」所發表的大作，我至今還沒有拜讀，否則，想早已有反批評。</p>
<p>第三，你所刋的對照表，未免太無聊。你的眼睛祇看見人家而沒有看見自己。因爲你先下手，你把前人的著作產品據爲私有。這兒，我不能不問你是不是欽定的文學史家？何以你看過了的原著者的書本，我就不許看呢？何以你引用過了的原人的材料，我就不能引用呢！你一樣，也未始不能把「不凡」的等著拿來和漢魏以來的各作家的全集，詩鈔及今人的論著各列一對照表。這點，大家都是根據前人，似可不必多所羅織。拙編上中下凡三十萬言，中國文學的一二萬字還不及十五分一。退後一步，我就是利用了你的「不凡」，也不是壞事，因爲文化是一切智力的總和，你對於這方面有了長處，我拿來補其他的短處也未始不可。否則，你就不要出書，你把你的意見藏起來作江湖術士的口訣好了。然而就祇這一點，我也還有許多補充，至於我對這點所下的社會說明，譬如兩漢之所以產生辭賦，魏晋六朝作家之所以消極，唐詩之所以特别發展，五代及宋之所以有詞，元曲之所以發生，明淸章回小說之所以出現的原因等，我想你安徒生專家實在想抄也無從抄的。這便是我對於本書的著重點。</p>
<p>第四，拙編「世界文學史」畢竟和安徒生專家的中國文學小史「英雄」所見絕不相同。否則，我便用不着來整理牠了。我希望方法論上的批評拙編的，請從方法論着手，因爲「一切都是内容决定形式」，這便是我的原則；以後若再有人撇開方法論而只下煩瑣的形式工夫，我當認爲故意不理解，爲時間經濟，恕不答覆！</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>好像表妹的產生，其唯一的原由就因爲有了表哥，淑羣之於斯濱也是如此。斯濱的家和淑羣的家離得不遠，因此他們更多接近的機會；接近到某種程度，淑羣的腹中便起了變化，於是他們不得不也走上那有許多表妹們和表哥們所已走過了的道路。</p>
<p>從那結婚，斯濱可以說一些的新鮮都沒有得</p>
<p>到，而相反地，却從此失去了那俞摸的情趣。而且同時他還感到一些不愉快，因爲他覺得這於他僅是一個義務，一個無可避免的義務，由於淑羣的腹中的變化。對啦，他對於她的腹中的變化，很倒有些迷戀，他常却撫摩着那在逐漸高起來的肚皮，有時他還向它凝望着，看它</p>
<p>裏面的似乎有節奏的跳動。</p>
<p>可是只在那孩子剛產生後他　興奮了一　　間，他覺得不知怎麽他的興趣在一天天地低落下去。他什麽事情都不想做，在眞感到時間不容易過去的時候，他就隨便在書櫉中抽一本詩集翻閱。有時看到了什麽喜歡的，他便把它譯也來；譯出了却又並不留着。在他的空寂不能以看詩或譯詩來充塡的時候，他也會想到去看看他的朋友。</p>
<p>出去看朋友並不是他的習慣，因此他的朋友看到了他去不免會稍露驚異的面色，於是他立刻便感到侷促。一侷促就不會坐得下去，他便急出了一個他所以去看他的原由，略談了一回就走了。可是連去了幾次以後，這種侷促便無形地消滅了，那樣他便可坐很久的時間。而且卽使他偶或感到他的主人也許會討厭他的久坐，他也會自解說，去看人本來是爲自己，在對方沒有些微那麽表示以前，在自己想坐的時候儘可坐，固無須去找假設來困擾自己的。可是他雖然發見了那寬慰，他却自己坐不下去了，尤其在人家恭維他的夫人的時候。</p>
<p>對啦，一樣地坐，他爲什答不出來，因爲在朋友的家裏的確並不能找到什麽樂趣··也許只有一個回答，就是因爲不在自己家裡。他接着深入地推究他爲什麽不喜歡躭在自己的家裏，那推究的結果是，這使他自己都驚異，由於淑羣的情性的太好。</p>
<p>是的，他討厭她的那種入微的體貼。他寗可她呌着，鬧着，哭着，笑着；他要出去，她就一把拉着，他要譯詩，她就把他的稿紙撕去··只是要整個地佔有他。她不願她那樣地聽從他的話，或者甚至預先設備着她以爲他所需要的一切。他想到這，心中起着反感，便不肯再去忍受，在他是忍受，他以爲，雖然在她無疑地是好意，她那樣的措施了。（未完）</p>

<h3>平凡的事（十七）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>他們都機械似地站住了，一面就看見一條弄堂口上走出三個武裝的兵士來··一個在前的，手裏握着自來得式的手槍，胸前懸着手溜彈，兩個在後的，橫着上了刺刀的步槍。他們在取出了隨身的護照給他們騐明了之後，那個握着手槍的兵士就來仔細盤問他們，然而盤問的那種情形，却像是一個熱心的小學敎師仔細考查一個受了委屈的新學生似的·····</p>
<p>他們終於和這第一個步哨的崗位相别了。向北走了一百多步就向東轉；走了些時又團了幾個灣，於是就漸漸看見了敵人在半月之中所施的摧殘屠殺工作。</p>
<p>最初，之光望見了當前偏左之處，遠遠地有一所像是正在營造之中的三層五間式的紅磚高樓，幾面的墻壁都像是已經砌好了九分九，可是内部的木材却似乎完全沒有裝上一件。於是他竟想起在這個新時代，何以有人肯用這種舊體裁，繼而又想起何以内部裝修並沒有動工，而搭在外面的木頭架子却已經卸得完全不見；末了，他再走近一點兒才明白了··那墻匡兒内部不僅本來應當甚麽都是完整的，甚麽都是完整了多時的，並且還應當有過種種的陳設，種</p>
<p>種的生命，大槪半月以來的某一天，這座高樓遇着了敵人的一顆硫磺炸彈，於是牠裏面的一切，就隨着牠上面屋頂一齊坍了，燬了，因而只剩下這四面凌空的墻壁，這四面凌空尚帶焦痕的墻壁！</p>
<p>這眞呌之光非走到跟前去看明白不可了！然而他的脚步兒還沒有移動多時，就在街心發見了一個被敵人炸彈灣成的大坑，坑邊的泥土比地面要高一兩尺。他又望見很近的地方，有十多幢市房也炸得，或者不如說是燒得只剩下一枚空壳子。然而空壳子畢竟還保存了舊時營造物的輪廓，漸漸地，之光又有了新的發現··墻呢，只剩下大大小小一堆堆一灘灘的零落破散的瓦礫了，木材呢，連炭屑子也看不見一點兒了，偶爾從半塊立在路邊的界碑或者一段留在路邊的石墻基，才呌人連想到當初那個地方一定是有房子的！一個營造工程立在這種地方參觀，正和一個醫生走到一個逼陳了碎支破腹的屍首的屠塲駐足相似白何况乎這屠場在目前還繼續不住地日趨擴大！</p>
<p>一個守崗的兵士向他說··「同胞，這裏本是一個很大的弄堂，我們在剛打仗的時候，就用了做砲除的一個陣地，那裏曉得五六天之前，被矮鬼用四架飛機，連燒帶炸地弄成這個樣子！········」</p>

<h3>棉市回漲之由來</h3>
<p>美棉續漲···空户交貨不足</p>
<p>人心激動···散户紛紛抵補</p>
<p>棉棉市驟漲、以外棉步漲、而本月份空方交貨不足、買方準備收貨、抵解廠商、於是人心激動、散户抵補、市勢突然轉緊、惟遠月新棉抛空者頗多、以賒借之美棉、届時可以抵申、故對於新棉看低、然海外棉市仍在趨漲中、</p>

<h3>蔬食美味菰爲最新生</h3>
<p>夏令，蔬食是最合宜的，大槪自廢曆五月下旬至六月底！社會上拿這大魚大肉，葷腥油膩的菜餚暂時屏棄了，香蕈·冬菰·靑笋·香椿·等是盛行了，尤其是香蕈·冬菰，更爲素食中唯一的鮮味美品。</p>
<p>香蕈丨也稱香菰，和冬菇，是姊妹，在植物學上，同屬隱花植物的一類。形體如傘，大的徑有四五寸，面色黑褐，内褚嫩黃，生於槐·　·揂·等樹木上*</p>
<p>，氣芬芳，味更鮮美。</p>
<p>蕈菰的種植，是由業種菰的人，丨大多數是滁州籍而散處各地的丨尋覓適當的山地，（須多上述各類樹木·而周圍在二十里以上者，過大不適用，）設法收買，然後將山上的樹木，一古腦兒齊根砍斷，上面覆以稻草，於是聽任雨淋</p>
<p>日曬，漸漸變化。那些樹木，驟被砍斷，其根部所含滋養質，還很豐富，這種質份，由下向上，就發而結爲蕈菰。在最初一年，所生的蕈菰，小而且萎，尚</p>
<p>不能採。等到二年以後，才大而繁多，這時候，種菰的人，便可得到收穫了。　　我國產菰著名的地方，如安徽，丨寗國·屯溪·丨浙江·丨蘭溪·處州丨福建，丨建寗丨江西等處，都有大宗出產。但因國人對於種植培製，多墨守陳法，不知改良；有時更因天時地利，種種關係，出品參差不齊，優劣互見。所以近年來銷行市塲，多被日貨所奪，日貨的優點，便在能應用科學方法，種植培製，出品片張均匀，色味俱佳。最近一二年，我國也已有用新法培植的，如寗國，處州等處，成績很好。我們極希望各產地，都能趕緊研究改良，以發展此極有希望的種菰事業。</p>
<p>蕈菰的出產，旣有上述許多地方、貨物品質，也因產地的各别，而稍有不同。如寗國·屯溪等處產品，體積肥厚；而蘭溪·建寗等處所產，便較薄。他如色光·形體·氣味·都各有差别。但這些如非業中，决不能輕易辨出。一般的鑒别，以（一）片張大而體積厚；（二）蕈傘面色黑或深褐；（三）蕈摺丨裏面的襞積丨色光黃亮；（四）菌柄小短；（五）氣味芳。備此五點，便是佳品了。至於日貨的鑒咖，則大致蕈傘烏黑而微有光；質厚肉頭極肥，蕈摺鮮黃，香氮較濃。　蕈菰　裝置，　　　　的簍子。丨日貨用本箱外又有花名標明丨形式或方或圓，　不一致，每　約重一百五六十斤至一擔以上。價格以擔計。</p>

<h3>給前進的靑年</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>時代的巨輪不住地向前邁進着，文化的洪　澎湃着整個的　　　　　靑年們，你不願做一個時代的落伍者嗎？你不願被時代淘汰嗎？請你走向學問的途徑，這是一條康莊光明的前程，</p>
<p>有許多的靑年不是說生活的苦悶嗎？不是說人生的黯淡嗎？靑年們，惟有學問的途徑能調濟你生活的苦悶，惟有學問的途徑能美化你黯淡的人生，　　但，事實吿訴我，一般有志前進的靑年，爲了環境的軀使，脫離了學校的門庭，走上生活的途徑，去追求衣食住來維持生命，放棄了追隨時代的使命，　　前進的靑年們，難道你們永遠地做一個生活的奴隸了嗎？你們的意志永遠被生活剝奮了嗎？不，不，你們脫離了學校的門庭，並不是不能去追求學問，更不是能貫澈你前進的初衷，祗要你能明瞭對於時代的責任，祇要你有鐵一般求智的慾望，祇要你能認識人生的眞義，</p>
<p>靑年們，我也是一個二十二歲的靑年，並且早有了職業，但我對於讀書非常的興奮，因爲我有二句自己鼓勵自己的立身的規律，就是「把工作來維持我的生活，把盈餘的精力用以探求無窮的學識」，我相信「工作」和「讀書」是人生最正當的途徑，</p>
<p>今夏我得了時間的允許，進了本報所辦的業餘補習夜校第一分校，雖然要化十餘里路車費的代價，雖然一天的工作夠我疲憊，但我把疲憊的身心帶進學校，終是換了愉快的身心回來，因爲我許多的迷津，欣慰着得了啓示的門徑，疲憊的身心也於不知不覺間恢復了，</p>
<p>靑年們，如果你們的時間允許的話，希望你也進一個與你適宜的夜校，去補習種種的學識，否則也要盡你的精力，利用你的餘暇借些或買些有益的書籍自己去研求，這樣，直接增進了你的學識，成爲一個時代的人物，間接增進生活技能和對社會服務的效率，那是一條多麽光明的前程，</p>
<p>靑年們，請走向學問的途徑，（却酬）</p>
<h3>新嫁娘的日記</h3>
<p>— 勗予</p>
<p>這是一個新嫁娘的日記中的片段。我的終身大事，一生幸福所關的婚約，旣被媒妁之言，父母之命，輕輕的完結了；我這個已經失了靈魂的軀壳，便在一陣鼓樂之中，傀儡登塲似的到了這人地生疏的「婆家」來。</p>
<p>這個年頭，百物昂貴，嫁女確非易事，何况我家本無恒產，只靠着老父一雙手活家養口，尚虞不給，那有多大的銀錢來賠嫁呢？因此累得我受着百般的羞辱，萬分的痛苦，唉！這個時世，眞是死得窮不得啊！</p>
<p>古語云「娶妻娶德」，可是如今一般人人的心目中，却存了「娶妻娶財」的奢望，化了些聘金，除了買到一個人丨不，一個生兒子的機器丨進家，還希望得到一份豐厚的妝奩，最好還得使他們靠着丈人峯，而謀到一官半職，那纔會爲了財勢，愛屋及烏的，把媳婦當作「菩薩」看待；否則難免要被視爲「脚下泥」，而加以蹂躪，虐待，簡直猪狗不如丨</p>
<p>當我蒙着頭巾，低眉菩薩似的坐在床沿上，便聽到隔室的女眷們，唧唧噥噥的對於我的妝奩，在談長說短··</p>
<p>「你老人家也不要懊惱，你媳婦的妝奩雖薄，可是她的針黹却很好，而且相貎了很端莊·······」</p>
<p>「唉！那種寒酸的窮相，我看見就生氣」。</p>
<p>我聽了婆婆的口氣，想到將來，正在不寒而慄的當兒，一羣男客擁着他進來，大家都是醉態可掬，「語無倫次」的閙新房，並且要我敬他的酒，我只得站起身來執壺，忽然一個男客喊道··「你們看啊！這位新娘子是六指頭的」。於是隨聲附和的要我伸出手來。</p>
<p>「手上竟這麽多的老皮，倒像一個窮苦的老媽！」小姑說着，驕矜地伸出柔荑一般的玉手。</p>
<p>「她怎像你在我們家這樣的嬌生慣養呢？人家要靠着她苦做，不做就會餓死」。婆婆故意對着我說，臉上露着鄙視的顏色。唉，天賦我們一雙手，自食其力的苦吃苦做，竟會被人視爲恥辱的事情，那末，那些依賴他人，不勞而獲的寄生蟲，倒是光榮的嗎？</p>
<p>「老阿哥，你各事要愛護你這新嫂嫂啊，你比她大上十八歲哩丨千萬不可再像從前對待那兩個已故的嫂嫂一般，一個不高興，便拳打脚踢一齊來，纔好！」說話的是一個女學生模樣的小姐。</p>
<p>她這話頓使我感學得這個花燭輝煌的洞房，罩滿了愁雲慘霧，宛似有鬼影憬憧的地獄一般，不禁毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>這時他已經爛醉如泥的倒在床上，鼾聲大作，只賸我獨自呆坐，看到那一對埀着點滴燭涙的紅燭，似乎在那裏替</p>
<p>我未來的身世傷感，我再也抑不住心頭的悲酸，伏在鴛枕上，吞聲忍泣的盡情一哭。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（三十一）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>這幾句話可猛打中了他的心坎，他再也不能自持的了。起初還看住美子那雙慈和的黑眼仁，呆站住不動，接着便突然緊抱住他，臉蒙在她的髮浪裏，無限說不出的辛酸在胸頭湧上來，喉嚨硬結住，像小孩一般地抽搐起來。美孑丨飄流異國的美子，情感脆弱的美子那禁得起這種動情的哀抑，眼眶裏驟然漲滿了熱滬，像母親似的，像姊姊似的，像情人似的，輕輕拍着石喬的背，再撫摸着石喬的肩膀。從哽咽中喊首··</p>
<p>「李先生，李先生，你說呀，你說呀··」</p>
<p>石喬聽着這種哀切的喊聲，更加倍的嗚咽起來，心裏儘管想將一切的委屈和盤訴出，口裏却一個字也吐不出來，他倆抱着移動脚步，石喬坐在床沿上，美子便坐在他身上。兩雙眼睛又對視着，對視一番之後重新又熱涙迸流。還是美子先開口··</p>
<p>「究竟爲什麽啊，我們都是這樣命苦！」</p>
<p>石喬舉眼望到玻璃窗外，搖搖頭，想說話又不說出來。他怎能吿訴美子，說自己堂堂男子漢連飯都沒有吃呢。</p>
<p>但是美子今天絶對不於過他，好像他不說出來自己便不能安心般的。</p>
<p>「我當然是沒有能力帮助你的呢。不過你不妨和我談談，解解胸中的悶氣哩！」</p>
<p>「美子，你對我太好呵！不値得呀！」</p>
<p>「不要說這些罷！我雖則已作人婦，不能長遠安慰你，總希望我能陪伴你一天好一天。你對我說呀！」</p>
<p>「我··停了一停。「我目前有一種急逼的用處，你，請你暫借給我幾塊錢，我過幾天就還你的，因爲······」石喬終於這樣轉灣抹角地說了，說了之後，眼光躱避開去，向房裏的什物亂瞭。</p>
<p>還等不及美子的回話，下面立哈諾夫的脚步聲走在門階前了。她很快地從身上掏出一張鈔票插在石喬的手裏，一隻手便揩乾了眼眶邊的涙濕，整了整衣，連忙走出房去了。並裝出毫無其事地喊道··</p>
<p>「立哈諾夫，回來了嗎？這聲音在石喬聽來，無論如何是嘶着的，而且有着不可抑制的顫慄。</p>
<p>石喬於是嘆了一口氣，這一口氣好像將幾天來抑鬱着的苦悶全都吐洩了似的，胸口裏鬆懈了許多。</p>
<p>但當他意識到手裏握着的鈔票，重新又痛苦起來。便索性滾倒在床上，一個人痛痛快快的哭起來，喊起來　他往　　　　　　都消麽子　他好像自己變了一個人。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops and Zhang Haipeng's Forces Move Towards Chahar Border to Seize Dolon and Guyuan</h3>
<p>The Damaged Railway Bridge Near Xuanhua Has Been Repaired; Eastbound Train Delayed by Twenty Hours</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise Between Beiping and Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Hiraga Brigade and Motegi Brigade have moved towards the Chahar border, joining the puppet army of Zhang Haipeng, totaling over 20,000 troops, with the aim of seizing Dolon and Guyuan. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng's troops recently conscripted 650,000 catties of millet and 220,000 catties of white flour within the territory of Huailai County. Fang's troops completely destroyed the sleepers and tracks of Bridge No. 104 near Xin Zhuangzi Station. The No. 2 train, which was supposed to arrive in Beiping at 3:30 PM yesterday, was delayed west of Zhangjiakou. Upon reaching the site, it could not proceed. The Beiping-Baotou train, which departed from Beiping yesterday, also stopped at Huailai. Subsequently, the railway authorities dispatched workers to repair the bridge last night. Bridge No. 104 was completely repaired by 1:30 AM this morning. The Beiping-Baotou train immediately departed westward and had passed Xuanhua by this morning. The No. 2 train arrived in Beiping this afternoon, delayed by twenty hours. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities here have decided to ignore Feng's request for a reply to his telegram. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the road bridge destroyed by Feng's troops has been repaired and trains have resumed service, the atmosphere of tension has not diminished. Mediators from all sides have admitted for the first time today that they are powerless. People from all walks of life in China believe that the outbreak of war is only a matter of time. It is said that Feng declared that if war breaks out, he can hold Zhangjiakou for a month. People generally have many speculations about Sun Dianying's attitude. Sun's army is still stationed along the Ping-Sui Railway, waiting for trains to Baotou to advance to Qinghai. People fear that once Sun's army departs, the war between Feng and the Central Government will break out, as Sun's army is currently a buffer between the two armies. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang's demolition of the railway bridge on the Ping-Sui Railway to prevent the advance of Beiping troops is a completely provocative gesture. To date, Feng has been appealing under the banner of resisting Japan, but the demolition of the bridge has revealed Feng's attitude of resisting the Central Government. Therefore, the Central Government will regard him as a rebel. The official just issued a statement saying that Feng did not truly recover Dolon, but rather the local garrison spontaneously revolted. Therefore, they captured the city without firing a single shot. As for Feng's claim of 1,600 killed and 300 wounded, the official believes it is absolutely absurd. Feng's current position is quite difficult. According to reliable sources, unless Feng voluntarily abandons Dolon, the "Manchu" army will advance to seize it and its surrounding areas. According to an official, the Beiping authorities have failed in their attempts to persuade him, so they have no choice but to resort to force. It is also said that Feng wants to take advantage of the name of resisting Japan to carry out the reality of rebellion, and at the same time, he is trying his best to publicize it to win the sympathy of the people. It seems that Feng will be resolved soon, either by surrendering or retreating into the desert area. However, judging from Feng's personality, he may retreat into the desert.

<h3>President Wang Discusses the Reorganization of Puppet Troops in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of reorganizing puppet troops in Chahar, many outsiders do not understand the truth. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited President Wang of the Executive Yuan this afternoon to inquire about the situation. President Wang gave a detailed answer. The following is a record of President Wang's remarks. The telegram that I replied to Mr. Li Ren Chao and Mr. Chen Zhen Ru yesterday has already been published in the newspaper this morning. The whole matter about the reorganization of puppet troops in Chahar has not been fully disclosed. Since the loss of Rehe, many troops have successively retreated from Rehe to Chahar. Among these troops, some are volunteer soldiers who retreated from the three northeastern provinces to Rehe, and then from Rehe to Chahar. There are also some bandits, and some are even carrying the banner of puppet troops. The Military Commission had already drafted measures to deal with them separately. Genuine volunteer soldiers will be reorganized into formal troops, bandits must be disarmed, and puppet troops must be resolved. After Mr. Feng arrived in Chahar, he indiscriminately reorganized all of them, thinking that the more the better. In fact, it is truly an endless source of trouble. Recently, the propaganda about the recovery of Dolon has become even more intense. Recovering Dolon is indeed a good thing, but there are no Japanese troops stationed in Dolon. There are only about 2,000 troops under Li Shouzhong, remnants of Cui Xingwu's troops from the original Rehe army, who were reorganized by the puppet state. Therefore, once Mr. Feng sent someone to negotiate, a part of them obeyed the reorganization, and another part could not stand their ground. Then, Ji Hongchang led Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and other troops to station in Dolon. We should understand that the reason why lost territories cannot be recovered is not because of the existence of puppet troops. If we think that we can recover lost territories just because we reorganized or expelled some puppet troops in Dolon, then we are truly underestimating the affairs of the world. And the tens of thousands of soldiers who died in the Battle of the Great Wall will also shed tears underground. This kind of vain and childish mentality has caused a lot of trouble in the past, and we should take it as a strict warning in the future. This has already been explained in yesterday's reply telegram. Now, let's further discuss whether reorganizing puppet troops is a good method. I can assert that it is not a good method. First, these puppet troops have no principles and completely take their own interests as the standard for their allegiance. They can suddenly carry the banner of resisting Japan and be protected by the Japanese, or they can suddenly carry the banner of the puppet state and contact us to pledge their allegiance. It is truly as the saying goes, "They rely on others when hungry and fly away when full." Today, they have been reorganized, and this lost territory seems to have been recovered. Tomorrow, they will turn their backs, and this lost territory will still not be ours. Second, puppet troops are endless. How can the country's limited financial resources and the people's limited wealth be able to support them all? Moreover, the more they are accommodated, the more they can value themselves. They will always treat the hosts as guests, oppress the local people, trample on the people, and commit all kinds of evil. If they are slightly punished, they can betray at any time. Therefore, I believe that reorganizing puppet troops should be done with utmost caution and should not be taken lightly. Here, I am also reminded of the Luandong area. The issue of taking over the battlefield in Luandong was not resolved until more than a month after the ceasefire agreement was reached. This is precisely because of extreme caution, so as to avoid future troubles. Therefore, it is better to be criticized, suspected, and scolded by those who do not understand the content than to casually muddle through. In fact, in the past month or so, we have been racking our brains for this issue all the time. Initially, the puppet troops in the Luandong area demanded to be reorganized with a number of 40,000 people. The Beiping Military Branch and the Political Committee, taking into account the future burdens on the people and local security, strictly reduced the number. After several rounds of consultations, the number was reduced from 40,000 to 30,000 to 20,000, and finally to 4,000, only one-tenth of the original number. The expenses for reorganization and demobilization were also greatly reduced, far from the original request. The main reason for the delay in the takeover is actually this. Now that the measures have been decided, we can untie the knot in the shortest possible time. If we also follow the method of Chahar, taking in 5,000 when 5,000 come and 10,000 when 10,000 come, then there would be no need to wait until today. However, how can we properly deal with these many troops that have been reorganized? If there is no proper method for handling them, the result will only be the name of recovery without the reality of recovery. The future troubles are truly unimaginable. Therefore, although Dolon and Luandong are both recovered in the same way, the results are not the same. Therefore, we are now concerned about the Chahar issue, not only that it may invite foreign troops and lose territory, but also that it may support hundreds of thousands of mixed troops in a poor border area. Once the military pay is not sustained, the color of the entire Chahar province on the map will change with the minds of these hundreds of thousands of people. What the heart calls dangerous, I dare not but tell. I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to this. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Steering Committee Plans to Finalize the Economic Conference Procedures</h3>
<p>The Economic and Monetary Committees Will First Meet to Discuss</p>
<p>Separately Accepting Reports from Various Subcommittees</p>
<p>The Plenary Session Will Be Convened on the 27th</p>
<p>Representatives from Eight Major Countries Will Speak</p>
<p>(London) The procedure for ending the World Economic Conference has now been drafted. It has been decided to convene a plenary meeting of the Economic Committee on July 21 to accept the reports from the various subcommittees of the system. The Monetary Committee is scheduled to meet on July 24, also to accept subcommittee reports. The Steering Committee will meet on the 25th, and then convene a plenary meeting of the Economic Conference on the 27th. At that time, eight major representatives will speak. After that, the Steering Committee will hold another meeting to finalize the conclusion. As for reconvening the conference, it will probably be decided by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will decide its actions based on the speeches at the closing session. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Economic Conference, it is expected that if the major countries cannot reach a general understanding on major issues, the World Economic Conference may not be reconvened. Extremely important diplomatic talks will be held in the fall. Although the conference has not achieved the great hopes of the optimists, the exchange of different opinions has opened up avenues for future discussions. The silver proposal is welcomed by the general public and is considered to be the only concrete proposal on the monetary aspect of the conference. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Silver Committee Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>(London) The International Management of Silver's Efforts by Biddleman Have Now Failed. The Silver Subcommittee Has Passed a Resolution Endorsing the Greater Use of Silver as Currency and Advocating That the Issue of Limiting Silver Sales Be Discussed by Producing Countries. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Silver Issue Subcommittee of the Monetary Committee of the World Economic Conference unanimously passed a resolution with the following recommendations: (1) Major silver producing countries and countries with silver reserves and large silver usage should find a way to reach an agreement. (2) Governments should not take legislative procedures that would cause the value of silver reserves to fall below 800 parts per thousand. (3) Governments should, to the extent possible, use silver coins instead of paper money. The above recommendations also have exceptions, that is, if the agreement stipulated in the first article is not reached by April 1, 1934, all recommendations will become invalid. Also, in any case, the effective period should not exceed January 1, 1938. The recommendation also states that when the fineness of silver coins exceeds the face value in the silver market, in order to avoid hoarding and destruction, governments may freely adjust the minting of silver coins. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) As of today, it seems that gold standard countries are trying to prevent the establishment of a silver agreement and its signature at the Economic Conference before the recess. After the US representative Biddleman reached an agreement with the Dutch and British on the fourth revised draft resolution, the Italian representative today came forward to obstruct and propose a new resolution for discussion. It is said that its content is far from the necessary conditions for restoring silver prices, which Biddleman believes. According to the US representative, the Italian case will further complicate the situation and delay the date of the agreement. According to reliable sources, no draft agreement on the silver issue has ever been signed with first initials. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Goods Must Clearly Indicate Origin</h3>
<p>The Commercial Policy Group Passes a Report</p>
<p>(London) The Indirect Protection Policy Subcommittee of the Economic Committee of the Economic Conference, at its meeting yesterday, passed a report on "Country of Origin Marking," advocating the establishment of an agreement stipulating the following: (1) When countries implement laws regarding "Country of Origin Marking," they should avoid all discriminatory treatment against each importing country; (2) Laws regarding "Country of Origin Marking" should not damage goods or reduce the value of goods; (3) These laws should not contain excessively strict provisions that would hinder trade; (4) Before revising the Country of Origin Marking Law, there should be a reasonable period to notify the countries concerned; (5) A procedure should be established to allow those who suffer damage due to the Country of Origin Marking Law to file complaints; (6) The Country of Origin Identification stipulated by each country should be simple and consistent. The above opinions have been agreed upon. In addition, there are several opinions that cannot be agreed upon, namely: (1) The timing of marking. One side requires marking only when the goods are sold, while the other side requires marking when the goods are exported; (2) What procedures should be adopted when promulgating new measures regarding the Country of Origin Marking, opinions differ; (3) Friendly resolution of disputes, opinions differ; (4) The current methods of Country of Origin Marking should not be increased, and should be gradually abolished in the future, opinions also differ; (5) Exemption measures for "Country of Origin Marking" privileges, opinions differ.

<h3>End of Drafting Committee Meeting on Commercial Debt</h3>
<p>A Lot of Talking to Draft a Resolution</p>
<p>Only Broad Regulations on Debt Made</p>
<p>(London) The drafting committee of the economic conference discussing the issue of commercial debt concluded this afternoon after a long discussion. During the discussion, the president of the German central bank, Schacht, spoke several times, causing disputes. The most important issue was the article passed by the commercial debt issue committee. Schacht believed that the publication of this article at this time was too early. The drafting committee then slightly modified the draft resolution proposed by the representatives of France, Britain, Italy, and Romania and passed it. This resolution aims to maintain the balance between creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(London) After several weeks of discussion, the drafting committee of the commercial debt subcommittee has reached an agreement. If the economic conference convenes a general assembly, a resolution will be proposed suggesting that debtors should do their best to repay their debts. Only when it is absolutely necessary can creditors and debtors directly negotiate the reorganization of debts, and at this time, it should be based on the debtor's ability to pay. Because this resolution only makes a broad regulation on the debt issue itself, all other issues related to international commercial debt have been almost completely deleted. Therefore, the committee believes that the general assembly will be able to pass this case in principle. A French representative also stated after the draft resolution was completed that, as far as he knew, this was just the usual method used to resolve debts. However, even this common method with general remarks has been debated before a resolution was reached, and sometimes fierce verbal battles have occurred. It is said that representatives of several countries have attempted to link commercial debt with other issues, especially with the issue of currency stability. There were even attempts to raise the issue of intergovernmental debt, but the US representative strongly opposed it for fear of triggering war debts, and eventually, the matter was dropped. At the end of the resolution, it was clearly stated that intergovernmental debt is outside the scope of discussion of the World Economic Conference (National Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Collapse of Western Hemisphere Sugar Conference</h3>
<p>Cuba's Request for Tax Reduction Rejected by the United States</p>
<p>(Washington) The American sugar conference, which attempted to reduce sugar production in the Western Hemisphere and stabilize sugar prices, has virtually collapsed. The London Economic Conference also failed to reach an agreement on sugar production. Therefore, sugar has become one of the serious problems facing the US government. The Provisional Political Council will consider whether to include domestic sugar producers in the general industrial business regulations in the future, and the possibility of allowing Cuba to develop naturally. According to the American Sugar Conference, the purpose was to reduce the sugar production of the US mainland, its affiliated islands, and Cuba. However, Cuban sugar producers insisted at the last minute that the US import tax on Cuban sugar should be reduced from two cents per pound to one cent. In addition, all foreign sugar would still be subject to the current tax rate, as an exchange for Cuba's reduction in sugar production. However, American sugar producers refused the request because Cuban sugar producers enjoyed the benefit of low labor costs, and a tax reduction would allow Cuban sugar to completely control the US market. The Cuban representative then threatened not to continue negotiations (National Telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Sugar Conference broke down today. The Cuban representatives have departed for home, leaving only one representative in Washington to report future new negotiation developments. At the final meeting held today, Cuba expressed its willingness to join the reduction agreement, but was unwilling to seal up and destroy the existing huge amount of sugar reserves, and insisted that after Cuba reduces its planting by 50% in the next season, the US import tax on Cuban sugar should also be reduced by half. However, the US and Philippine sugar industries did not grant its request. It is heard that the London side also temporarily suspended negotiations for the same reason (National Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the US Recovery Political Council Held</h3>
<p>Proposed Provisional Industrial Regulations</p>
<p>(Washington) The special political council organized by President Roosevelt, composed of ministers and representatives of various economic construction agencies, as well as industrial advisors and Johnson, the director of the Economic Recovery Administration, submitted a provisional industrial regulation to the White House after its meeting today, preparing to implement it immediately until the government and various related industrialists can agree on a formal regulation. Roosevelt did not participate in the meeting of the special political council, so it is not yet known what his attitude is towards the provisional regulations. It is generally believed that he will explain his views within a week (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Instructs Ishii to Lobby European Countries</h3>
<p>Kadono Remains in England to Negotiate Trade Issues</p>
<p>Fukai Goes to Canada to Attend Pacific Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Representative Ishii asked Foreign Minister Uchida for instructions, saying that the Japanese representative office plans to dissolve on July 31st, and he will take Representative Fukai to visit Europe and return to Japan from Marseille in early August. Advisor Kadono will remain in England. Foreign Minister Uchida immediately convened a department meeting and telegraphed the following content: (1) The government agrees to close the representative office at the end of July. Advisor Kadono will remain in England to handle the Anglo-Japanese trade issue. Other members will either return to their original posts or return to Japan immediately. (2) The government is very much looking forward to the results of your visit to European countries, but whether to take Representative Fukai with you is up to your discretion. (3) Representative Fukai must detour to Canada to attend the Pacific Conference. (4) If the economic conference reconvenes in October, Ambassador Matsudaira will be appointed as the plenipotentiary representative, and no representative will be sent from Japan again (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to use Representative Ishii's reputation in European countries to order Representative Ishii to visit major European countries along the way when returning to Japan to lobby on three major points: (1) Japan originally did not want to withdraw from the League of Nations, because its continental policy could not be understood by the politicians of the League of Nations. Your Excellency must fully explain Japan's grievances and seek the understanding of various countries. (2) Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it still hopes to be on good terms with all countries as before. I hope that various countries will not change their original policies towards Japan due to its withdrawal from the League of Nations. (3) Japan's policy towards Manchuria cannot be changed. Japan is very willing to negotiate new reciprocal treaties with various countries on other trade issues (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The list of Japanese representatives to be sent to the Pacific Investigation Conference held in Canada has been decided as follows: Chairman Representative Inazo Nitobe, Representatives Masaharu Anesaki, Yasunosuke Sato, Mohei Mogi, Yūsuke Tsurumi, etc. The advance team below Tsurumi will depart from Yokohama at 3:00 pm today on the Hikawa Maru. The others will depart on August 2nd (Dentsu dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>The Crux of the Failure of the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A diplomat told a Central News Agency reporter on the 19th that the World Economic Conference failed due to conflicting interests. The crux of its demise lies in the conflict over the gold standard. The United States is currently engaged in currency inflation in an attempt to raise prices and promote international trade, which has caused great pain to France. In the past, Britain and the United States also encountered the same situation, which eventually forced Britain to abandon the gold standard with the United States. It is still difficult to predict whether the conflict between the United States and France can be buffered by a subcommittee or will even force France to abandon the gold standard. However, there is a possibility of returning to cooperation in the future (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Economic Conference Facilitates Soviet Diplomatic Success</h3>
<p>Contradictions of Imperialism Become More Profound</p>
<p>丨Russian Newspaper Summarizes the Conference丨</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Pravda, in reviewing the results of the World Economic Conference, said that the conference is about to come to an end without solving any basic problems. The newspaper added that the conference also had its results, namely, the struggle between European debt groups and the United States over the war debt issue has suddenly turned serious, and the international financial conflict has also expanded. At the same time, the conference also promoted the development of tariff wars between imperialist countries and deepened the infighting on issues such as gold reserves, price fixing, and the redistribution of markets and sources of raw materials. Pravda continued, saying that only the Soviet Union has achieved some concrete achievements, such as the cancellation of the British boycott of Soviet imports, and the signing of a convention containing the Soviet Union's definition of aggressor countries. The newspaper concluded by saying that the first session of the London Conference only deepened the contradictions in the capitalist world, which is obvious (TASS dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Are Puppet Organizations Starting to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway?</h3>
<p>Puppet Ministry of Communications Railway Director Goes to Harbin</p>
<p>Requests Replacement of Soviet Cadres by the Board of Directors</p>
<p>(Changchun) Morita Narimoto, Director of the Railway Department of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications, went to Harbin from Changchun on the 19th to seek to reform the internal affairs of the Chinese Eastern Railway, that is, to obtain the actual power of joint Russian-Manchu management. The "Manchukuo" government, in view of the fact that the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Tokyo have stalled due to the Soviet side's claims on prices and ownership, has decided to resolutely exercise its strength from the standpoint of respecting the spirit of joint management of the Chinese Eastern Railway, eliminate the Soviets, request the replacement of Soviet cadres by the board of directors, fundamentally correct the command system, and take an active attitude. It is also fully prepared for counter-strikes or riots by Soviet employees (Dentsu dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government believes that there is no need to pay a high price for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It has ordered the delegation to conduct negotiations with this policy, and at the same time appointed Director-General Sakatani as the liaison officer. The "Manchukuo government" is now preparing to exercise its sovereignty in the event of a breakdown in negotiations and strictly suppress the propaganda activities of the Chinese Eastern Railway's communist employees. If the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations break down, Russian-Manchu relations will inevitably become acute (Japan United Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet representatives have shown sincerity in the issue of selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, which has become particularly evident recently. Regarding the method of reducing its asking price of 250 million gold rubles, the Russian side absolutely opposes the adoption of the method of making a gold ruble market agreement used in the previous Russo-Japanese fishing ground agreement, and always maintains the unit of gold ruble, intending only to reduce its amount. However, the prices currently advocated by the Russian and Manchu sides are very different. It is difficult to expect a satisfactory solution unless the Russian side approaches Manchuria's claim of 50 million yuan. It is expected that there will be many twists and turns in the future of the negotiations (Japan United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to Russian newspapers, a number of Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway have recently resigned for the following reasons: (1) Because most of the Russian employees have worked on the railway for more than 20 years, according to the railway regulations, they should receive a pension, so they have all submitted their resignations in order to receive the pension. (2) They are eager to break away from the railway so that they will not be forced to return to Russia in the future (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Araki Uses Dogs to Supervise Puyi</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Dogs Made Great Achievements During the Invasion of Manchuria</p>

It is truly the most ferocious and intelligent warrior with the highest merit. Now that the incident has ended, the Army Ministry has carefully selected this loyal and pitiful dog to send to Puyi. This dog is of great importance to the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, and the heads of the Army are particularly pleased with this move.</p>

<p>A Reuters Moscow dispatch on the 6th of this month stated: "The Lenin Public Library here has now become the world's largest library. According to an announcement by the authorities, it contains 5 million volumes..." It also said: "According to the compilation statistics of the Library of Congress in Washington, the British Museum is ranked sixth among the world's largest libraries. The records of the books stored in the world's major libraries are as follows: Lenin Public Library, 4,832,948 volumes; Washington Library of Congress, 4,477,431 volumes; Paris National Library, 4 million volumes; New York Public Library, 3,476,971 volumes; British Museum, 3.2 million volumes; Berlin Library, 2,287,821 volumes; Poly Library, 1.25 million volumes." We feel a lot after reading this.</p>
<p>First, today's commentators often say that capitalism is civilized and advanced, and that the shaking of capitalism is no different from the scourge of human civilization. Some even say that capitalist society is a permanent human organization, which means that it is the highest expression of human civilization. Even if we take the books stored in libraries as the standard, it is enough to show the lofty and boundless nature of capitalist culture. The fact that American libraries are the best in the world is especially talked about by the general public. However, today's Lenin Library has a wealth of collections and is about to surpass the United States. The Washington Library has even retreated to second place. From this, we can see that the rapid development of socialist culture is on par with capitalist countries, or even surpasses it. Therefore, whether capitalism will be the highest expression of human civilization in the future is still a big question.</p>
<p>Second, although the libraries of capitalist countries have a wealth of books, those who benefit from them are mostly a very small number of people, and they have nothing to do with the vast majority of people. The purpose of Soviet libraries is to improve the culture of ordinary people. I have heard from people who have traveled to the Soviet Union and returned to China that in the Tsarist era, libraries were places for scholars and ladies to spend time chatting. Today's readers are mostly ordinary people. "High banks become valleys, and deep valleys become hills." Changes in personnel are also like this. Our country is known as the country with the oldest culture. However, as of today, there is not a single large-scale public library in the country. Those who are responsible for promoting culture are actually engaging in the movement to preserve the inherent culture from ancient paper piles. In fact, the so-called restoration is no different from reversing the course of history. What is inherent may not be able to be preserved, and what is new has no way to be inspired. How should our country promote culture today? What standards should we use to promote culture? This is what those who are responsible for promoting it should consider most urgently.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Gong and Peng's Trip Difficult to Fulfill</h3>
<p>Wang Will Go to Jiangxi to Discuss New Methods with Chiang</p>
<p>Ma Zhongying Threatens Airplane Station Personnel</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to an important source, Peng Zhaoxian and Gong Bicheng temporarily suspended their flight to Xinjiang. The truth is that on the eve of Gong and Peng's departure, Zhang Chengxia and Zhong Yi, the senators of Huang's appeasement envoy, flew back from Xinjiang and reported the details of the changes in Xinjiang to Wang, including those that were not known outside. After receiving the report, Wang felt that it was necessary to make a new decision on the handling of Xinjiang affairs, and ordered Zhang Cheng to go to Jiangxi first to see Jiang, and planned to go to Lushan in person to meet with Chiang to discuss a solution. Therefore, he temporarily ordered Gong and Peng to suspend their flight to Xinjiang, and then decide on the trip after Wang and Chiang decided on a new method. Huang Musong sent a long telegram from Xinjiang to Wang, the contents of which are still kept secret. After receiving the telegram, Wang felt that there was a new development in the Xinjiang affairs, and in addition to forwarding it to Chairman Chiang, it is heard that he has decided to put aside the affairs in Nanjing slightly and take the time to go to Jiangxi in the next few days in order to consult with Chiang as soon as possible on coping methods. It can be seen that the focus of the central government's solution to the Xinjiang affairs lies not in the true removal of Sheng and Liu and the safety of Huang's appeasement envoy. After all, there is no difficulty in truly removing Sheng and Liu, and Huang is inherently safe. What is difficult to solve is how to properly deal with the chaotic situation in Xinjiang Province so as not to cause problems again, such as how to thoroughly resolve the Hui-Han disputes, and how to prevent Ma Zhongying from rebelling again. In addition, there are other problems in Xinjiang Province, all of which need to be discussed in detail. When Huang Musong flew to Xinjiang this time, for fear that Ma Zhongying in Hami would cause trouble, he ordered the pilot to fly directly to Dihua without stopping in Hami, which caused Ma's suspicion. He threatened the responsible personnel of the company's Dihua station, saying that if the plane does not stop next time, the company will harm the entire personnel of the station. Since receiving this report, the company has not dared to fly any planes that do not stop in Hami, which has led to the rumor that the Eurasian planes cannot reach Dihua directly for a while. This is also one of the reasons for the delay in Huang's return to Nanjing and Gong and Peng's flight to Xinjiang. The Ministry of Communications may send another plane to fly directly to Dihua to pick up Huang (Special Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong telegraphed his office in Nanjing on the 17th, saying that after receiving the support telegram from President Wang, he immediately ended the affairs of this office and waited for the plane to return south. He hoped to urge the plane to come directly. The office has contacted the Eurasian Company to send a plane to Xinjiang next week to welcome Huang back to Nanjing. His entourage and other personnel who continued to Xinjiang have separately returned from the road (Special Telegram on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Air Force Exercise in Japan</h3>
<p>Taking a Practical Approach to Kanto Air Defence Exercises</p>
<p>Using Yatsu to the Tokyo Coast as a War Zone</p>
<p>(Hua Lian Tokyo Communication) It can be said that the Japanese warlords' preparations for war are meticulous. Military attachés from various countries are also paying close attention to their plans. According to the Tokyo News, this Kanto air defense exercise takes a practical approach, using live ammunition for shooting or bombing, so its significance is significant. It is said that the Tokyo Garrison Headquarters and the General Staff Headquarters' operational plans have been obtained by the American aviation attaché and have been telegraphed to the American Command. According to news obtained by Japanese military detectives, this news was transferred to the American military attaché in Japan by Japanese traitors. The Japanese military is eliminating Japanese traitors on the one hand and strictly preventing the leakage of secrets on the other hand. The Japanese military deliberately announced this news, with the aim of promoting anti-American sentiment and enhancing national patriotism as a backing for the military's militarism.</p>
<h3>Air Force Launches General Offensive on Yatsu Coast</h3>
<p>In this aerial offensive and defensive operation, both sides used live ammunition. Although the aim is to defend the capital city of Tokyo, it is not convenient to drop live ammunition in the bustling city. According to the research results of the Army Command and the Tokyo Garrison Headquarters, it was decided that the Yatsu coast in Chiba Prefecture would be the actual combat location. The area from Yatsu to Tokyo Bay, along the coast of 12,000 meters, is the war zone. Markers are set up on the sea 2,000 meters from the coast as targets for air strikes. Various large and small bombs are dropped by heavy bombers, fighter planes, and reconnaissance planes. A white cloth flying behind the planes serves as a target for the artillery fire of the anti-aircraft gun team.</p>
<h3>Participating Units</h3>
<p>The units participating in the actual combat on the Yatsu coast include the Shimoshizu Air Regiment, the Hamamatsu Bomber Squadron, the elite of various aviation schools and</p>
<p>various aviation squadrons, the Hamamatsu anti-aircraft gun team, the searchlight team, the listening device team, and the radio communication team. The air force bombing is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. on August 7, and the ground troops' shooting exercise is scheduled to begin at 1:00 p.m. On that day, approximately 10,000 military and political figures and approximately 100,000 civilian groups and civilians will participate. It can be said to be the largest exercise since the beginning of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Mobilization of Students and Autonomous Organizations</h3>
<p>Tokyo Governor Kosaka has ordered the school affairs department to issue an extraordinary mobilization order to all levels of schools under its jurisdiction. Even during the summer vacation, all students must participate in the Imperial Capital air defense exercise on August 9 and be under the control of the National Defense Research Association of each school (student military groups organized by military instructors sent to various schools by the Ministry of the Army) to take on various tasks. Town councils, self-defence corps, and various civilian organizations are also ordered to participate and belong to various military and rescue communication work of fire brigades, Red Cross rescue teams, security squads of rural armies, and communication squads of telegraph teams.</p>
<h3>Mobilization of Civilian Radio</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Garrison Headquarters has been convening civilian air defense teams since July 20 to train air defense sentry work. The Metropolitan Police Department conducts night flight training for air defense surveillance personnel and inspects the details of the capital at night. It will also convene 130 civilian radio researchers from the entire city, select 32 of them as teachers, and organize a patriotic radio team, divided into two groups. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Communications, one group is in the Defense Command, sorting out the messages reported by various teams and providing them to the Command's intelligence office. The other group is further divided into eight teams stationed in various surveillance areas, reporting the information obtained in their area to the Command. The Ministry of Communications has approved each team to start practicing from August 5, reporting weather, enemy situation, and alerts, and can freely experiment until August 11, without being subject to peacetime restrictions. After the exercise, the opinions and results of the participating technicians will be compiled into a book as a reference for wartime organization. It is said that the Japanese military is paying close attention to the work of this team and will change it to a permanent defense organization.</p>
<h3>Method of Controlling Lights</h3>
<p>On July 14, the Ministry of Railways convened a joint conference of the Tokyo Railway Bureau and representatives of commercial railways under the jurisdiction of Tokyo Prefecture to discuss the method of controlling lights. It is said that it has been decided to take the method of shielding various traffic signal lights, without extinguishing their lights. Hand-held signal lights will be changed to kerosene lamps, using weak light instead of strong light to shorten the distance that the light can reach. There is currently no way to prevent sparks from trolley lines. Special lights are set up at the stations of Numazu, Utsunomiya Hachioji, and Taira to indicate that they have entered the air defense area. The lights in each passenger car are halved, and the power of each light is also halved to prevent light from leaking into the air. The lights in the front and rear of each train and car must be turned off. A hand-held kerosene lamp is set up on the operating platform. The light from the stove is surrounded by black cloth. The Tokyo station has 1,500 electric lights, divided into three types: 470 lights that should be extinguished, 430 lights that should be controlled, and 600 lights that can be kept for traffic use. On the day of the exercise, these 600 lights will be used, and their candlepower will be reduced.</p>
<h3>Operational Directive</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Garrison Headquarters decided on the contents of its wartime directive on July 14 as follows:</p>
<p>The relations between Japan ○ (i.e., the United States), which have been fraught with crisis for many years, have now been severed. The United States declared war on us on August 1. Our command immediately appointed the Kanto Defense Commander and designated the area around Kanto that has entered a state of war to begin defense work.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Army has also decided on the air defense steps within the province, the outline of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Control lights,</p>
<p>(2) Train for refuge, disinfection, security, and firefighting,</p>
<p>(3) Use smoke screens to cover the Ministry of the Army with white smoke,</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The aviation exercise to be held in Tokyo next month will be the only grand event in Japanese history. According to local newspapers, all amateur radio students have been called to join the exercise. There are now 16 people who have registered to join the exercise, 8 of whom have joined the Command of the Air Force attacking the enemy, and the remaining 8 have been assigned to serve in various substations. In preparation for the air defense exercise, from August 7 to August 11, each radio student can freely generate electricity for testing. (Nineteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>American Aviator Arrives in Irkutsk</h3>
<p>Soviet Government Does Not Allow Change of Route</p>
<p>Reuters Irkutsk 18th - American aviator Post, attempting to break the world flight record, is progressing smoothly and arrived here at 3:35 pm today (local time) completing the fourth leg of his planned flight, a total of 1,000 miles in a time of six hours and four minutes. Post will take a short break here before departing for Khabarovsk at 11:00 pm tonight. As the time spent resting in Novosibirsk was quite short, the current record is several hours earlier than his own record co-flown with Gatty in 1931. When he was in Novosibirsk, he sent a letter to a London newspaper stating, "I will be flying from here to Irkutsk in the near future, as the latter has a better airfield and is more convenient for repairing aircraft parts. I expect to rest there overnight and fly to Khabarovsk the next morning. After arriving there, I will only add a little oil and then fly to Fairbanks. The fog between here and Moscow is the thickest I have ever seen in my life. I flew as high as 21,000 feet, thinking to find a clearer environment, but to no avail. Therefore, the flight at that time relied entirely on the radio broadcast by the Sverdlovsk station for guidance. I did not receive the Novosibirsk radio until about half an hour from the city, when I was able to hear it. After that, the weather cleared up, so the last hundred miles were quite easy," and so on.</p>
<p>National 19th Irkutsk - American aviator Post arrived here at 3:35 pm yesterday and decided to stay longer than originally planned as Post was extremely tired and his eyes were sore. In addition, he wanted to thoroughly inspect the entire aircraft as it would not be as convenient to inspect it after arriving in Khabarovsk. Post wanted to go to Nome via Yakutsk to shorten the journey and save time, exceeding his own 1931 record, but Russian officials refused to allow the change of route on the grounds that it was very dangerous. When questioned as to whether Russian aviators often took this route, they replied that the Russian government had a responsibility to protect the safety of foreign aviators and could not lightly allow them to take risks. Therefore, Post still had to take the longer route to Khabarovsk.</p>

<h3>Henderson Arrives in Berlin, Advocates Meeting Between French and German Premiers</h3>
<p>Reuters Berlin 19th - Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, recently met with German Foreign Minister Neurath and others in Berlin to discuss disarmament matters. He will meet with German Premier Hitler in Munich this week. His purpose is to discuss the difficult disarmament issues. Henderson has already contacted Italian Premier Mussolini and French Premier Daladier. Henderson told guests today that it would be most appropriate if the premiers of Germany and France could meet, so that the suspicions between France and Germany could be dispelled. European peace is firmly based on the friendly relations between France and Germany, he said. German officials say that Hitler does not object to meeting with the French Premier, but there are currently no arrangements for this meeting.</p>
<p>National Berlin 18th - Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson's consultations with the German authorities in Berlin this time have achieved satisfactory results. Henderson is scheduled to leave here for Prague tomorrow morning.

Also arriving was Angeniz, the director of the Disarmament Group of the League of Nations Secretariat. After arriving in Germany, Henderson held earnest discussions with German Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, and Ambassador Nadolny, as well as representatives of the Aviation Department, for two days, Monday and Tuesday. All important matters in the Geneva Disarmament Conference have been studied in detail, and Germany's position has been clearly stated to Mr. Henderson. The conversation was extremely cordial, and all wanted the Disarmament Conference to be successful, so extremely satisfactory results have been achieved. Mr. Henderson later told foreign reporters that the key to disarmament lies in the friendly understanding between France and Germany, and the future of the overall European situation also depends on this. Mr. Henderson's intention is that after the Four-Power Pact is completed, it should be followed by a sincere conversation between the French and German Prime Ministers, so that the pact can take effect. This is the only way to eliminate the suspicions of both sides. Mr. Henderson also said that after leaving Prague, he will go to Munich. German Premier Hitler has invited him to meet there, and then he will take the route via Paris to London. German newspapers have praised Mr. Henderson greatly, and said that the withdrawal of troops from the Rhineland was due to Mr. Henderson's efforts as Foreign Minister.</p>

<h3>Murder Occurs on French Warship in Kobe</h3>
<p>Deputy Commander Slota Stabbed to Death</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi reports that the commander of the French Far East Fleet dispatch vessel Le Croiseur (1500 tons), Lieutenant Colonel Cigal, was berthed at the Mitsubishi Shipyard quay in Kobe Hyogo. At 7:00 p.m. on the 10th, a cook, an Annamite, suddenly had a brawl in Deputy Commander Slota's cabin with his accomplices over trivial matters. The Deputy Commander returned to his cabin to mediate, and after a few words of conversation, the Annamite pulled out a gun and fired at Mr. Slota, the bullet hitting his brain. He died at 11:00 p.m. At the same time, the murderer also committed suicide in the cabin. It is reported that the root cause of this tragedy was that Mr. Slota intended to dismiss the Annamite, so the Annamite had harboured a grudge. This time, Mr. Slota happened to be returning home after his handover, so he took the opportunity to act.</p>
<h3>Fascism Becomes Popular in France</h3>
<p>Reuters Paris 19th - The French National Socialist Party movement is gradually taking shape, and is almost identical to fascism or Hitlerism. This trend can be seen in today's vote at the National Socialist Party Congress. The Congress expelled 80 members of parliament affiliated with Renouard Tellier from the party for supporting the government on the army budget bill and declaring that they would act according to their conscience and not be directed by the party. Right-wing fascism, under the leadership of Taittinger and Flandin, has been brewing for months, but there is also a similar trend in the left-wing, so there will soon be noteworthy developments.</p>
<h3>Germany Continues to Persecute Jews</h3>

<h3>Ten Killed and Twenty-Five Injured in Fight Over Beautiful Woman</h3>
<p>National Angora 18th - A violent and tragic armed fight occurred in Smyrna, Turkey, today. The root cause was actually a beautiful woman. The woman's suitors were divided into two major factions, each wielding guns and engaging in street fighting for several hours. As a result, ten people were killed and twenty-five were seriously injured. The incident occurred because one of the suitors of the woman, together with his friends, wanted to kidnap her, but his rival detected it and also formed a team to wait beside the woman's residence. When the two sides met, they each raised their guns and fired, resulting in many casualties outside the door, but the woman was unharmed.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Chahar Becomes Tense as Japan Plots to Reoccupy Dolon</h3>
<p>Feng's Attitude Remains Peaceful, Hope Dwindling</p>
<p>Troops Taking Over Defense in Chahar Continuously Advance Toward Xuanhua</p>
<p>Iron Bridge Near Xin Zhuang Blown Up by Feng's Troops</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the loss of Rehe, Chahar has become the focus of attention for Japanese, Russian, and Red imperialists. The Japanese army has long harbored intentions to invade Chahar but has delayed taking action due to three reasons: (1) The occupation of Rehe has not been long, and the battles along the Great Wall have just ended, leaving internal matters to be sorted out and temporarily no time to look westward. (2) Initially, they planned to use traitorous troops to gradually encroach on Chahar as their vanguard, but after Liu Guitang's troops entered Chahar, they suddenly revolted, and the plan failed. (3) Although the Japanese army is extremely barbaric, any dispatch of troops to invade Chahar must have an excuse. Until there is an opportunity to provoke, they will not launch an attack. Since Dolon was recovered by Feng's anti-Japanese forces, Feng has issued a circular telegram reporting the event. The Japanese army believes the time has come and, using the excuse of violating the truce agreement and threatening the border of the puppet state of Manchuria, plots to counterattack Dolon and implement the invasion of Chahar. Starting yesterday (17th), the Motegi Cavalry stationed west of Rehe's Weichang has begun to advance towards Dolon. A portion of the 8th Division under Nishiyoshi, which withdrew from Gubeikou to Chengde, is also gradually moving west to join forces with the Motegi Cavalry. The puppet troops under Zhang HaiPeng and Cui Xingwu have received orders from the puppet state to counterattack Dolon and harass eastern Chahar. Cui's troops are reorganizing Li Shouxin's brigade, which was defeated at Dolon, and will join the Japanese army in taking responsibility for counterattacking Dolon. Zhang Haipeng's puppet troops plan to invade Guyuan. Once all the troops are mobilized, they will attack Dolon. The situation in eastern Chahar is becoming increasingly tense. After Feng's troops under Ji Hongchang and Li Zhongyi recovered Dolon, they are now pacifying the people and replenishing military supplies. If the Japanese and puppet troops come to counterattack, there will be fierce battles.</p>
<p>While the external situation in eastern Chahar is so tense, the southern section of the PingSui Railway is also filled with troops and military vehicles due to troop deployment and reinforcement. The troops taking over defense in Chahar, including those under Pang Bingxun, Guan Linzheng, He Sui, Feng Qinzai, and Sun Dequan, are continuously advancing and have reached the first stage of their destination. Pang Bingxun's troops have already arrived in the Huailai and Zhuolu areas, and the advance troops, the Li Fuhe Cavalry Division, have reached Xiahuayuan, 30 li south of Xuanhua. Pang himself is commanding in Huailai. The remaining Guan and He troops have arrived in Kangzhuang, Hecheng, and other places. All troops have temporarily stopped advancing to await further orders. The Fang Zhenwu troops in Xuanhua have already made military arrangements. The Shalingzi and Ningyuan areas between Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua also have considerable preparations. The outposts of both sides are not far apart, and there is a great sense of tension.</p>
<p>The peace movement regarding the Chahar affair still continues, albeit tenuously. Although there has been no progress, final efforts will be made to try to turn the tide. Li Xin, who was ordered to go to Chahar, returned to Beiping at around 2 AM this morning. At 9 AM, he and Deng Zhexi visited Song Zheyuan at Wuyiku to report on the progress of the negotiations. At 11 AM, he went to Cuihua Bay to visit Xiong Bin, asking Xiong to convey all the information to He Yingqin. At 4 PM, Xiong met with He to discuss the matter. During Li's visit to Zhangjiakou, Feng convened a meeting and unanimously decided that although Dolon had been recovered, the anti-Japanese mission had not ended and the original position must be adhered to. No opinion was expressed regarding the peace proposal. According to Li Xin, Feng's views are roughly as follows: (1) Feng stated that he would never point his gun inward and, if no agreement could be reached, would voluntarily lead his troops to leave the area and implement his foreign policy. (2) If the authorities made sincere expressions regarding his telegram report of the recovery of Dolon, the anti-Japanese military affairs could be concluded, and the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army would be revoked. (3) No one is responsible for military and political affairs in Chahar Province, and he hopes that Song Zheyuan will immediately lead his troops back to Chahar to take charge. Judging from Feng's views, they are still far from what the authorities hope for. He Yingqin, due to his unrecovered illness, expressed indifference to Feng's views. Today, various parties are running around for this matter but have not yet reached a perfect solution. Huang Fu, representing Ma Boyuan, was again ordered to go to Zhangjiakou today, departing from Beiping at 3:20 PM and scheduled to return to Beiping on the 21st. All parties are working to mediate the Chahar affair, and the situation is gradually reaching a dead end. Whether there will be a turn for the better is difficult to determine. According to a message from the Military Affairs Committee, at 6 PM tonight, the No. 104 iron bridge near Xinzhuangzi, east of Xuanhua on the PingSui Railway, was blown up by Feng's troops. From this, it can be seen that the situation in Chahar may erupt before mediation is possible. (July 18th)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Quietly Leaves Qingdao, a Stirring Incident</h3>
<p>Citizens' Assembly Urgently Resolves to Persuade Him to Stay</p>
<p>Shen Travels to Tianjin by Boat via Yantai</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Navy Commander and Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to firmly resign from both positions since the Bohai Fleet incident. Although the Executive Yuan has repeatedly telegraphed to appease him and various parties have warmly persuaded him to stay, his intention to resign has not been dispelled. Shen happened to believe that the National Products Exhibition and the North China Sports Meet were being held in Qingdao, and since they were important matters during his tenure, he could not quit midway. Now that the North China Sports Meet has ended and the National Products Exhibition has been open for many days, Shen believes that his mission has been completed, so on the morning of the 17th,</p>
<p>at 4 AM, he secretly left Qingdao by car. Few, even his close subordinates, knew when Shen left. This was because one of the resolutions of the Citizens' Assembly was to send people to the station and wharf if necessary to try and stop him from leaving. To avoid trouble, Shen left Qingdao secretly. However, before leaving, Shen had revealed his firm intention to resign to the heads of the various departments under the municipal government. Therefore, all bureau chiefs appointed by Shen were willing to advance and retreat with Shen and jointly submitted their resignations, which Shen approved. Before leaving, Shen instructed that political affairs be handled by Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng as an agent. Before Hu returns to Qingdao (Hu was previously summoned to Gan by a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inquire about the truth of the naval incident and has not yet returned), Municipal Government Councilor Zhou Jiayan will temporarily act as an agent. Although Qingdao's military and political affairs are still the responsibility of someone and are maintained as before, the citizens still want to persuade Shen to stay. Therefore, representatives of the presidium of the Citizens' Assembly held an emergency meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10 AM today (18th) to discuss the second step in persuading Shen to stay. More than 50 people, including the presidium and representatives of various legal groups, attended. Chairman Song Yuting reported on Shen's departure and said that according to private sources, Mayor Shen has indeed arrived in Weihaiwei and has been persuaded to stay by Commissioner Xu. How should this association proceed? Please discuss. There was much discussion at one point. Some advocated a strike to show their determination to retain Shen. Some advocated, in accordance with the second item of the Citizens' Assembly resolution (if necessary, refer to the precedent of the people-elected county magistrate of Zhongshan County and ask the central government to allow the local people to elect the mayor), to hold another Citizens' Assembly to elect the mayor. It was generally agreed that the above two proposals were either difficult or the time was not right, so they were temporarily reserved. Finally, two items were decided: (1) Telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang, and Chairman Huang, earnestly asking them to approve the continued effort to appease him and telegraph the Weihai Chamber of Commerce to do their best to persuade him to stay nearby. (2) Recommend Song Yuting, Wang Yangxian, Zhang Yutian, Deng Xiyuan, Zhang Legu, Yao Zhongba, Guo Jinnan, Li Lianxi, Zhu Wenbin, Su Kuangchen, Mou Shaozhou, Fu Bingzhao, Liu Hengsan, Zhu Ziheng, Liu Ziru, Chen Jin, and more than 20 others to go to Weihai to persuade him to stay. The representatives are scheduled to depart in six cars at 3 AM tomorrow (19th). After the cases were decided, the meeting was adjourned. (July 18th)</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shen Honglie quietly left Qingdao on the night after the closing ceremony of the North China Sports Meet, and his whereabouts are unknown. When the news came, all parties were extremely surprised. This morning (18th) at 7:45 AM, He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Education Department, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, and Shandong athletes who went to Qingdao to participate in the sports meet returned to Jinan. According to Zhang Honglie, they only knew that Shen had left Qingdao by car on the night of the 16th (i.e., the morning of the 17th), and his whereabouts were unknown. It is said that he has gone to Weihaiwei, but this could not be verified. Qingdao is now actively planning rescue measures, but it has not yet been heard what method will be used. As for the reason for Shen's departure, it is not difficult to guess. Shen is usually courageous in his duties and has done a lot of construction for Qingdao's municipal administration. Now he has suddenly encountered the unfortunate Bohai Fleet incident, and it is inevitable that he will be discouraged. As for why Shen did not leave before the sports meet but left after the sports meet, it was because the meeting had been prepared for a long time and was related to Chinese and foreign views, so he could not bear to affect the meeting due to one person, so he endured himself and handled the sports meet affairs as usual, without revealing any trace. His hard work is quite admirable.</p>
<p>Also, Cui Shijie, a member of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, also arrived in Jinan from Qingdao today. He and Zhang, Wang, and He reported Shen Honglie's departure from Qingdao to Han at the provincial government. According to Governor of Shandong Han Fuqu, Shen sent a telegram when he left Qingdao, telling him the distress of resigning and his determination to leave Qingdao. He originally intended to reply to the telegram and persuade him to stay, but it was too late. Now he has received a telegram from Zhang Kuiwen, Director of the Yantai Public Security Bureau, stating that Shen has arrived in Yantai by car and then taken a boat to Tianjin. Now I have telegraphed to persuade him to stay and have also telegraphed the central government to order him to stay, so as to avoid Qingdao, the throat of the coast, from falling into shock and panic.

<h3>The Method of Organizing Puppet Troops is Largely Determined</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Yao Ri</p>
<p>Zheng Yanhou, Commander of the First Brigade of the Security Force, Takes Office as Brigade Commander. The First Battalion of the Special Forces is Under the Command of the Brigade Commander. The Japanese Secretly Instigate the Puppet Troops to Seize Political Power. Recent Situation of Shi Yousan Organizing Puppet Troops in Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>Tangshan Dispatch: Zheng Yanhou, the former enemy commander of the puppet National Salvation Army, has twice resigned to Li Jichun. The brigade commanders of Zheng's troops have also expressed their willingness to advance and retreat with Zheng. The issue of reorganization and disarmament yesterday (15th) was almost at an impasse. Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong went to the puppet headquarters at 2 PM yesterday to meet Li to discuss remedial measures. Colonel Kita, a representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, also participated and all advised Zheng not to resign. In fact, Zheng felt that the position of battalion commander was too small, so he used his resignation as a threat. However, as a result of the consultation, the method was changed. Only one brigade of the war zone security force was organized, with Zheng as the brigade commander, under which there were two battalions, twelve companies, and thirty-six squads, a total of 3,000 people. Another special force battalion was formed, divided into two companies and twelve squads, totaling 1,000 people, which was also under the command of the brigade commander. In this way, the power is concentrated in one person's hands, and he can be complacent. Zheng's attitude gradually softened. Xue's consultation did not end until 2 AM this morning (16th). At 9 AM, Xue Zhiheng went to the puppet headquarters again to visit Li to continue the consultation. It did not end until 3:30 PM. The local people from all walks of life are afraid that Zheng will cause trouble after his resignation, and they are also jointly petitioning the puppet headquarters to persuade him to stay, so the situation is gradually improving today. It is heard that after the disbursement of the reorganization fee is remitted, the numbering and reorganization will begin. According to people familiar with the matter, Zheng Yanhou first went to Jinzhou to join Li in July last year. He achieved nothing in half a year. Zheng is brave and fearless of death. This spring, Yuguan fell, followed by the loss of Rehe. Li developed into Guannei. Li initially did not expect the Northeast Army to collapse upon hearing the news without firing a shot, so at that time he used Zheng's bravery and appointed him as the commander of the front enemy, allowing him to attack the main battlefield. Zheng seized this opportunity, bravely moved forward, and recruited Zhao Lei's battalion of He Zhuguo's troops, and also found a large number of weapons and ammunition abandoned by the Northeast Army east of the Luan River. His power was greatly enriched, and he gradually revealed his arrogance, acting on his own in everything and disregarding Li. After crossing the Luan River, Li already felt that he could not control Zheng.</p>
<p>The actual number of Li Jichun's puppet troops is unknown, not only to Li himself, but also to Zheng Yanhou and Li Xiukun. Because for a year, there has never been a roll call, and it is only based on the casual reports of brigade commanders, which cannot be verified. According to reliable news from the puppet army, the four echelons directly commanded by Li have no more than 2,000 people, and there are not enough than 1,000 guns. Zheng Yanhou's troops have no more than 4,000 people, and there are 3,000 guns. This time, he demanded reorganization and reported that there were 12,000 people, intending to collect more disarmament fees to enrich his own pockets. Now, the roster of each brigade has not yet been completed. After Li's army occupied more than ten counties east and west of the Luan River, he appointed Liu Jinbiao as the head of the puppet government affairs office and established the puppet government affairs office in Qinhuangdao on May 26, which was responsible for the administration and taxation of each county. The office is not located in Tangshan but in Qinhuangdao, which naturally has a profound meaning. According to those who know the inside story of the puppet army, after the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, the Japanese began to anesthetize the puppet army, instigating them to seize political power. Now this work is gradually showing results. Zheng Yanhou's opposition to disarmament by resigning also contains the fermentation of anesthetics. Liu Jinbiao's work in the political affairs office in Qinhuangdao continues as usual, with no intention of ending. In the future, when the puppet army's reorganization is completed and the provincial government takes over the political power of each county, it is feared that there will be problems in Fengrun, Leting, Luanxian, Qian'an, Lulong, and Linyu counties. It is heard that Li has expressed to Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong his intention to recommend private individuals to serve as the county magistrates of the aforementioned counties, which will be commissioned by the provincial government. Xue and Lei believe that they are only responsible for disarmament and are unwilling to be involved in political events, which would increase disputes in the disarmament issue. They only allowed this intention to be reported to the Receiving War Zone Committee. Therefore, according to the current situation, even if the disarmament issue can be compromised, there will still be problems in the future takeover of the counties east and west of the Luan River. Even if political means are used to reluctantly take over, if the administrative personnel do not listen to the puppet army's drive, they will be driven away, so the future is still pessimistic.</p>
<p>As for Shi Yousan in Qinhuangdao, his puppet title is the National Salvation Army. According to Wen Jixu, the secretary-general of Li Jichun, the intentions of Shi in this area are not very clear. It is only known that his cadre school has more than 1,000 people, and his guard regiment has more than 1,000 people. The Japanese Oohashi is running around and planning for him. Last month, the Japanese allocated 500 rifles, but Shi only received 250, and the reason is unknown. A few days ago, Shi sent someone to Tangshan to see Li, expressing his cooperation with Li. Li declined the request for cooperation because he was currently carrying out downsizing and was suffering from too many people who were difficult to arrange. Another theory is that Shi's cadre school will graduate at the end of this year, and during this period, he will recruit bandits from outside the pass with the help of the Japanese Kwantung Army. If Shi cannot survive in Qinhuangdao, he will move to the border between Liaoning and Rehe. It is not known which of these two theories is true. (July 16th)</p>
<p>A Suzhou Shop Assistant Commits Suicide After Being Falsely Accused of Theft: Liu Yusheng, a local man, 21 years old, was extremely honest. Due to unemployment and hardship, he was introduced by storyteller Fan Yushan to work as a shop assistant at the Yunhua Teahouse on Fuqian Street, with a monthly salary of four yuan. Recently, Yusheng won a lottery, totaling more than 20 yuan, and hid the money in his bedding. Unexpectedly, the teahouse owner, Feng Yunqing, claimed that more than 20 yuan was missing from the shop's accounts and suddenly found the lottery money in Yusheng's bedding, falsely accusing Yusheng of stealing it. Yusheng, after being falsely accused, ran to Fan Yushan for help and then secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Yesterday, he was taken to Boxue Hospital by a human-powered vehicle, but he died of poisoning before he could be treated.</p>

<p>Victim of Economic Oppression</p>
<p>Gu Heshang, a farmer from Han's residence in Penglai Town, is over 40 years old. He rents more than ten mu of land from Zhu Zhongqian of Liu's Lane in Luodian. Gu has accumulated more than one hundred yuan in rent arrears due to economic constraints. Zhu Zhongqian has repeatedly sent people to collect the money. The day before yesterday, Zhu sent a person named A Da to Gu's house to demand payment. Gu's wife, seeing the debt collector arrive again and unable to cope, in a moment of desperation, secretly threw herself into the river and committed suicide. Gu discovered that his wife had committed suicide and felt even more helpless. He was filled with sadness and suddenly spat out fresh blood and fell to the ground dead. A Da was horrified when he saw this and immediately went to Gu Heshang's family and said that he did not want the remaining rent of more than one hundred yuan and took out fifteen yuan as compensation.</p>

<h3>A Blackmailer Arrested in Qibao</h3>
<p>Li Akang and others, well-known blackmailers in Qibao, have been engaged in blackmailing by selling and transporting soil for a long time. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters previously sent a team to arrest them for a case, but Li and others dared to resist and escaped to the countryside, committing many crimes, and the people looked down upon them. Recently, they have intensified their efforts to blackmail farmers, Luo Jinde and Luo Jinyu, for 285 silver dollars, which was reported by local public organizations. Zhang Polang, a patrol officer from the Qibao Public Security Bureau, arrested them and handed them over to the county court for investigation.

<h3>A Bank Employee Who Embezzled Funds and Attempted to Flee is Arrested</h3>
<p>Wan Zihan, a cashier at the Nanjing Jiaotong Bank's Xinjiekou branch (currently using the alias Wu Huatang),</p>
<p>22 years old, was escorting money to the Bank of China yesterday, totaling 25,900 yuan. Unexpectedly, Wan had a bizarre idea. He secretly stole his own insurance policy from the vault, hoping that he could not be found after escaping. He hired a No. 1232 Anle Restaurant car for 30 yuan and traveled from Nanjing to Zhenjiang via the Shengju Road. Fortunately, the bank discovered it early and immediately used a long-distance telephone to notify the Zhenjiang branch. Xie sent someone to intercept him along the Shengju Road by car and reported it to the public security agency for assistance. Upon receiving the news, the Zhenjiang branch asked Manager Xu to request the Provincial Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate to send personnel to handle the matter together. At noon, near Paiwan, they saw a car speeding towards them. Inspector Lu Chunlin stepped forward to stop him and conducted an inspection. Wan was not convinced and was taken to the headquarters. Director Xu personally opened the box for inspection. The 25,900 yuan in banknotes was intact and returned to the Zhenjiang branch. The suspect was temporarily detained pending the arrival of personnel from the Beijing branch to Zhenjiang for further handling.</p>

<h3>A Rape and Murder Case Occurs in Baimao</h3>
<p>In Chenjing, Baimai Township, District 6 of this county, there is a person named Cao Ashui, who has no sons, but has a daughter named Ahu, who recruited Cao Zuxing from nearby to be her son-in-law. They have been married for many years, but Zuxing has been working outside for a long time due to livelihood reasons. Cao Ahu became acquainted with Ma Chuansheng, a tailor. Ashui not only did not interfere, but also repeatedly went to Ma to borrow silver dollars. Because of this, Ma's actions with his daughter became even more blatant. In early this month, Zuxing returned home to help with the farm work because the family's fields were very busy. Ahu and her lover were unable to have their way. Chuansheng held a special grudge. The day before yesterday (16th), because the weather was hot, Zuxing and his wife Ahu went to the fields to scoop water at night. When they returned at midnight, they passed by the Ma Family Cemetery and suddenly saw Ma Chuansheng jumping out of the cemetery with a stick in his hand and hitting Zuxing hard. Zuxing ran away in pain and went straight home. After waiting for a long time, Ahu did not return, so he searched everywhere but could not find her. It was not until the next morning that someone found Ahu's body on the Ma family tomb, kneeling on both knees, bleeding from her nostrils, covered with scars, with a rope around her neck tied to a tree. Cao Zuxing got the news and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to examine it. Unexpectedly, Ma Chuansheng heard the news and was extremely frightened. He had attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the river, but was rescued. On the 18th, the county sent examiner Liang Cheng to the village to examine the body. As a result, it was believed that Ma Chuansheng was a major suspect and was immediately taken into custody and held in Nanjing for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Opposition to the Forced Enclosure of Chishan Lake</h3>
<p>Chishan Lake is a reservoir lake shared by three counties: Jiangning, Jurong, and Lishui. It regulates farmland and is related to the livelihoods of the people. In the early years of the Republic of China, the provincial assembly resolved to dredge it, but it was suspended due to a lack of funds. In April of this year, Wang Zhonglin, the judicial section chief of the Navy Department, instigated his nephew Wang Yulin to lead hundreds of workers to forcibly enclose the silt around the lake, building dikes to bury the lake, considering it to be private land, which hinders irrigation of farmland along the lake. The farmers of more than one hundred villages in the three counties along the lake, because of their vital interests, have petitioned the provincial and county governments, calling for a stop to be put in place. On May 29, the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent Commissioner Zheng to inspect the lake with Director Xu of the Sha Tian Bureau, Technician Xia of Jurong County, and representatives of the people. Wang Zhonglin's nephew Wang Yulin, relying on his uncle's power, actually ordered workers to beat the Jurong Township Chief representatives Kong Guangxin and Wang Zeyuan and four others, injuring them, and surrounded the inspection personnel, forcing the representatives to sign a note allowing him to build the dikes before releasing them. The people along the lake were outraged and vowed to fight to the death. Yesterday, local gentry Gu Shaoyi, Wan Xunchen, Xi Cuicai, and Ma Ruzhou, in addition to again submitting a petition to the provincial government's Construction Department requesting a strict ban and ordering the restoration of the lake, also submitted a petition to the Navy Department asking that Wang Zhonglin be punished according to law to maintain water conservancy and value the people's livelihood in Ningbo.</p>
<h3>A Young Man Hangs Himself in Zhongshan Park</h3>
<p>In the Houfu Mountain of Zhongshan Park in this port, yesterday, (17th)</p>
<p>At around 7 AM, children went up the mountain to catch golden beetles and suddenly saw a man about 27 or 28 years old hanging himself in a tree. His feet were still twitching. The children were horrified and shouted that someone was hanging himself, running down the mountain. When the crowd in the park heard the sound and went up the mountain to check, the man had already died. The park manager reported it to the court for investigation. It was confirmed that he had hanged himself. Photos were taken and a coffin was prepared to wait for his family to claim the body.</p>

<h3>Liu Chongwu and Others Given Heavier Sentences; Various Organizations Petition for Amnesty</h3>
<p>Separate Telegrams Sent to Central Ministries and Councils</p>
<p>Requesting Lenience to Preserve National Vitality</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that various organizations in the city, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Citizens' Federation, believe that the sentences previously imposed on patriots Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, and others were inappropriate. After the police department appealed the case, the First Branch of the Jiangsu High Court surprisingly increased Liu and others' sentences to twelve years imprisonment, and Tian Shuiyang's sentence to six years. Considering this mishandling, they convened a meeting of the Committee to Assist Patriotic Volunteers and resolved that each organization would separately petition the Central Political Council, the Central Party Headquarters, the Judicial Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and other institutions to grant amnesty in order to preserve national vitality. The original petition is recorded below. It pleads for leniency for patriotic and courageous individuals who committed crimes out of patriotism, to preserve national vitality. The petition states that Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and Tian Shuiyang are all courageous individuals who do not forget their duty in times of hardship and do not forget their loyalty to the nation. They were indignant at the Japanese militarists' aggression and the treacherous merchants' collaboration, selling enemy goods. Consequently, they repeatedly committed the crimes of throwing bombs, firing guns, causing death or injury, or disrupting public safety. The case was prosecuted by Mr. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement, on behalf of the council. The First Instance Judgment of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu sentenced Liu Chongwu to seven years imprisonment, Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou to three months, suspended for three years, and Tian Shuiyang to two months, suspended for three years. Lawyer Gan, wishing to demonstrate the completeness of his legal capabilities to the taxpayers who support his livelihood with their taxes, appealed according to the law on the charge of premeditated murder. The Second Instance Judgment of the First Branch of the Jiangsu High Court overturned the original judgment and sentenced Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, and Cao Songshou to twelve years imprisonment for continuous joint premeditated murder, and Tian Shuiyang to six years imprisonment for assisting in premeditated murder. People from all walks of life are indignant. Lawyer Gan is not entirely to blame, as he misunderstood the nature of those who provide his livelihood. Furthermore, the judges who rendered the verdict ignored Article 76 of the Criminal Law, which outlines the points to be considered when imposing a sentence. (1) The cause of Liu and others' crimes was naturally the stimulation of patriotic sentiment. (2) The purpose of Liu and others' crimes was naturally to stop treacherous merchants from selling enemy goods and to save the nation. (3) The stimulation Liu and others received when committing the crimes was naturally the damage and aggression inflicted on our nation and people by Japanese militarists. (4) The intent of Liu and others was naturally to save the country,</p>
<h3>Not for Personal Gain</h3>
<p>(5) The relationship between Liu and others and the victims on ordinary</p>
<p>days was naturally without resentment. They only hated the fact that they were selling enemy goods. As for Liu and others' character and level of knowledge, and the consequences of the crimes and their subsequent attitude, there are concrete facts that deserve attention. People from all walks of life believe that while the judges hearing the case did not have to invoke Article 37 of the Criminal Law (which states that acts of self-defense (as a citizen) or defense of others (the nation and all its citizens) from imminent danger to life, body, freedom, or property (the aggression and destruction by Japanese militarists) are not punishable), they should at least have reduced or waived the sentence, or suspended it. Moreover, at this time,</p>
<h3>Traitors and Rebels</h3>
<p>like Hu Lifu are sentenced to death,</p>
<p>Hao Peng is released, and Li Jichun is incorporated and appointed as a committee member. Since the same crimes can be treated differently, the judges hearing the case were easily swayed by the authoritative arguments of Lawyer Gan against these patriotic and courageous individuals. However, the soundness of the nation depends on patriotic and courageous individuals, who are not easily nurtured and not easily found. Japan's judiciary's judgment regarding the arsonist who burned the Sanyou Industrial Factory in Shanghai is a valuable reference. Moreover, our country</p>
<h3>Granted Amnesty</h3>
<p>to the principal offender who assassinated Zhang Zongchang.</p>
<p>This was not for private gain but for the public good. Thus, we implore the authorities to acknowledge and consider our plea to show compassion and ensure the preservation of the vital spirit of the nation and encourage citizens to love their country. With the three trials leading to a heavier sentence, the country should grant a special pardon. Nothing could be more unjust or unfair.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a dinner for Sun Ke over concerns about partnership debts</h3>
<p>Hoping for Equal Protection of Creditors and Debtors</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a dinner for Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, at 7 PM the previous evening in the reception room on the third floor. Over twenty people were in attendance, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, Chen Songyuan, Chen Ziyi, Gu Xinyi, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Zenan, Ye Jiaxing, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Wenqi, Lao Jingxiu, Lu Wenshao, Wu Kaixian, Ma Chaoqi, and Wu Jingxiong. Wang Xiaolai chaired the event. During the dinner, Mr. Wang rose to speak, saying, "Today, taking advantage of President Sun Zhesheng's visit to Shanghai for rest during the Legislative Yuan's summer recess, I, Xiaolai, on behalf of the merchants of the city, have prepared a modest feast as a gesture of hospitality. I am deeply honored by your esteemed presence. I would like to present to President Sun and the distinguished guests the merchants' recent concerns regarding the provisions in the debt chapter of the Civil Code regarding joint and several liability for partnership debts, which do not align with commercial realities. We have repeatedly requested amendments but have not been granted them. We hope you will appreciate and adopt our suggestions. It would be most fortunate. In our country's commercial organizations, partnerships account for the majority besides sole proprietorships. Since the introduction of Western systems to China, some have begun to imitate and organize companies. However, their scope is limited to major cities. The majority of businesses still use the partnership system, with debts being divided proportionally, according to the shares. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Mixed Court, where power was controlled by foreigners, there have been cases of Chinese-foreign lawsuits where partnership debts were judged as jointly and severally liable, causing great uproar among the public. Disputes have continued for years. The former Supreme Court also offered an interpretation that combined joint division and proportionate sharing due to public sentiment. Unexpectedly, the debt chapter of the Civil Code was promulgated, and Article 681 stipulated that each partner is jointly and severally liable for the shortfall. From the perspective of equal protection of creditor and debtor rights, there should not be such a disparity. Partnership debts should be divided proportionally. If there is a shortfall, creditors should at most discount the repayment. Since they usually enjoy considerable benefits, it is reasonable to have a discounted repayment as a last resort. Moreover, creditors do not invest in just one store. Even if there is a discounted repayment, it will not lead to bankruptcy. If debtors are held jointly and severally liable, creditors will be selective and demand full repayment of principal and interest. Even if the debtor is bankrupted, it may not be enough to cover the joint and several liability of other partners, inevitably affecting other partnership businesses and causing them to shut down. Comparing the two, one is advantageous and the other is harsh. Is this the intention of equal treatment? The common sentiment is that investing in fields, houses, and real estate is subject to disasters, but the loss is limited to the invested fields, houses, and real estate. It is not enough to bankrupt the entire assets. If one engages in business as a partner, there is always the risk of joint and several liability and bankruptcy. Why not choose safety over danger? This policy encourages people to concentrate cash in cities, driving up land prices and discouraging investment in business. Some may retort that this would leave creditors without protection, and who would be willing to lend funds to stores? This is a fallacy. The result of proportional division is, at most, a discounted repayment. Moreover, loans are never concentrated in one store. Creditors should not receive excessive protection while debtors are placed in the difficult position of being bankrupted without being able to repay. This is the fair attitude that a legislative policy should have. From the perspective of merchants' interests, there are lenders and borrowers. Creditor and debtor rights are not completely separate. The reason for persistently disputing the provisions on joint and several liability for partnerships is to seek fairness in legislative policy and to align it with the current economic situation." These views were presented to the Legislative Yuan for amendment in March of this year. Subsequently, the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan replied that it had been instructed to refer the matter to the Civil Code Committee for reference. In June of this year, during the fourth session of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's member representatives' conference, six trade associations, including the Coarse Grains and Oilseed Industry, Bean and Rice Industry, Bran Industry, Coarse Grains Store Industry, Rice Milling Industry, and Timber Industry, jointly proposed the same motion. It was decided on the spot to resubmit the case to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. So far, no reply has been received. As we gather for this joyful dinner, I would like to present the summary of this case to President Sun and the distinguished guests, and ask them to view it with an open and fair mind, so that creditor and debtor rights can be equally protected. I, Xiaolai, will represent the city's merchants and wholeheartedly await your response."</p>
<h3>North China Banks Resolve Not to Contract Operations</h3>
<p>Banking circles in this city</p>
<p>Say a certain country is spreading malicious propaganda</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that according to banking circles in this city, rumors are circulating that North China banks, after closing their accounts for the first half of the year, have decided to contract their operations due to the repeated impact of warfare. This is inaccurate. North China banking circles have indeed suffered considerable losses during the war, but they have still been able to maintain normal operations. Furthermore, since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the markets in Tianjin and Beijing have gradually become stable. Bankers are currently planning to restore North China's financial system and assist the authorities in relief efforts to alleviate the people's suffering and allow various industries to flourish. The rumor of contraction is the result of malicious propaganda from a certain country or serves other purposes.</p>
<h3>Kong Xianrong and Others Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>It is Said That Wang Delin's Illness is Nearing Recovery</p>
<p>And He is Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong This Week</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that Wang Delin, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, contracted a gastrointestinal illness during his journey back to China from Europe via Hong Kong due to the fatigue of travel. He was immediately treated in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong and Wang's representative Liang Detang were sent to Shanghai to thank all sectors for their previous donations. It is learned that Kong and Liang, accompanied by Wang Zhisheng, Standing Committee Member of the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Volunteer Army Support Association in this city, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government in Fenglin Bridge yesterday morning at 10 a.m. Mayor Wu personally received them and spoke with them for twenty minutes before they departed. According to Kong, speaking to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, General Commander Wang (Delin) is recovering from his minor illness after medical treatment. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship within a week. After a brief stay, he will go to Nanjing to report to the Central Government on his anti-Japanese efforts in Heilongjiang and seek instructions. Then, he will return to Shanghai and proceed to the front to reorganize his troops and continue the anti-Japanese resistance, in order to recover the lost territories.</p>
<h3>Dai Ji Will Return to Shanghai Within Days</h3>
<p>To Handle Closing Matters, Official Appointment Still Pending</p>
<p>The Decision on Whether to Abolish the Garrison Command Will Be Made This Week</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan has resolved to transfer Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji to the position of Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Province. Dai himself was previously summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss everything in person. This newspaper's reporter learned from the Longhua Garrison Headquarters yesterday that Dai is expected to return to Shanghai in about two or three days to handle closing matters within his tenure. As for the date of his official appointment in Fujian, it will be after the completion ceremony of the January 28th Memorial Hall built by the Garrison Command. Regarding the candidates to succeed the Garrison Commander, there are many rumors, with Chiang Ting-wen, Xia Douyin, and Yang Hu all being mentioned. However, the fundamental issue is whether to abolish the Garrison Command. This matter is still under careful consideration by the Central Government. A final decision is expected from the Central Government this week.</p>
<h3>The Ningbo Aircraft Can Arrive on the 25th</h3>
<p>The Aviation Association Urges the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to Pay</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, in order to purchase the Ningbo aircraft, had an order contract for eighteen Curtiss Hawk fighter aircrafts which were purchased by The Aviation Association from American Continental Airlines of New York. The Association’s inspector, Mao Heyuan, reviewed and approved for them to purchase one of the eighteen airplanes to be named Ningbo. The aircraft has been shipped by the American National Shipping Company's General Pershing ship and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. Therefore, the naming ceremony of the Ningbo aircraft will be realized in the shortest time. The correspondence between the association and The Aviation Association is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Letter Urging Payment</h3>
<p>The Aviation Association stated that the second batch of ten aircrafts would arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, but the purchase price had not been fully paid. They sent separate letters to each team urging them to report and pay for the funds raised as soon as possible. In addition, they sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association the day before yesterday saying, "Dear elder, it has been a long time since we last saw each other. We miss you very much. We hope your plans will be successful and all is well with you. We are writing to inform you that the fund-raising for the Aviation National Salvation Fund in this city has ended early. However, it has not been completely closed because the funds raised by each team leader and organization have not been fully paid. We have always admired the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association for its lofty reputation and its words carrying weight. Therefore, we are writing to you to inform you to quickly report and pay the amount raised by your fellow villagers association to the Chinese Aviation Association to facilitate the progress. We hope you will do so. With best wishes, your younger brother, Li Dachao, July 17th."</p>
<h3>Pay Upon Naming</h3>
<p>After receiving the letter from The Aviation Association urging them to pay, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association immediately replied that the purchase price of the Ningbo aircraft, US$22,227, would be paid in full at the naming ceremony, and copied and recorded their letters to Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Section Chief Li Dachao, stating, "Dear Sir, Our association, in order to purchase the Ningbo aircraft, was shown a copy of the contract for purchasing American aircraft by your association. After consideration by all the committee members, it was decided at a meeting convened on July 17th to purchase one of the eighteen aircraft ordered by your association, to be named the Ningbo aircraft. According to the contract, each aircraft costs US$22,227. The price to be paid by our association will be paid in full at the naming ceremony of the Ningbo aircraft. Is this feasible? We await your reply. Respectfully, etc." Also, in a letter to Li Dachao of The Aviation Association, it was stated, "I just received your letter and fully understand everything. All the funds raised by our association were resolved at a meeting of all committee members convened on the 17th to purchase a Curtiss Hawk aircraft from your association. On the 18th, we sent a letter to Chief Wu."</p>
<h3>The House Tax on North Sichuan Road Will Be Collected Starting This Autumn</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Spoke Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that residents in the area north of Laobazi Road on North Sichuan Road had a misunderstanding over the collection of house tax, which aroused a storm. It was settled after mediation by Yu Qiaqing and others. The reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the city government's solution to the case. He made the following statement: "There is no doubt that the administrative sovereignty over roads built beyond the boundaries belongs to our government. The reason why the municipal government did not immediately collect house tax on the sections of roads built beyond the boundaries in the past was because some water and electricity had not yet been supplied by our side, and police power had not yet reached there. Now, the water and electricity in the area north of Laobazi Road on North Sichuan Road are supplied by our side, and police power has also reached there. Since the residents enjoy the supply of public utilities and the protection of peace and order, they have a duty to pay house tax. However, the residents in that area made the excuse that the roads built beyond the boundaries have not yet been recovered and asked for a delay in collection. Such arguments and attitudes are not what Chinese citizens should have. If they use the decline in commerce after the January 28th Incident as an excuse, then the areas affected by the war last year were even worse than that area. The reason is also very insufficient. Our government is responsible for maintaining national rights and rectifying taxes, and it is not convenient to give up. However, since the case was forwarded to the government by the Municipal Council, hoping for a reduction, it was decided that all house taxes in that area will be collected starting this autumn, and the house tax for the summer will be waived. Those who have already paid may deduct it when paying the autumn tax to show leniency. However, those who instigate resistance to tax will be investigated immediately once they are found out."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Submits Nine Conditions to Yi Sheng Factory and Sets a Deadline for Reply</h3>
<p>The Factory Has Had Good Results from Discussions with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after seven rubber factories, including Yi Yuan, Da Zhonghua, Hongda, Dade, Zhengda, Tianxing, and Shanghai Shiye, were warned to relocate by the British and French Municipal Councils, all but Yi Yuan, which was forced to close, automatically improved. The industry associations also submitted a request to the municipal government for negotiation. Unexpectedly, the Yisheng Rubber Products Factory No. 1 at 83 Binlang Road in western Shanghai and Factory No. 2 at 31 Binlang Road received letters from the Public Concession Municipal Council on the 15th of this month, simultaneously warning them to improve their equipment. They stated that the oil room, machine room, and raw materials should be set up separately to avoid accidents, etc., with nine conditions. They had to reply within a week, otherwise the Municipal Council would send inspectors to check. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned of the news and visited Mao Yuting, the manager of the factory. According to him, the factory has reported to the industry association and has already talked to the Municipal Council, with good results.</p>
<h3>Decline of the Chinese Egg Industry</h3>
<p>Egg Industry Association Asks Economic Council to Reduce Tariffs</p>
<p>Total Value of Fresh Egg Exports Declining Year by Year</p>
<p>The Guo Wen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Egg Industry Association believes that the increase in egg import tariffs by European and American countries has dealt a major blow to the Chinese egg industry. It has drafted a memorandum to be sent to the Chinese representatives to the World Economic Conference, Song Ziwen and Bei Songsun, to be submitted to the conference for remedies. Yesterday, the reporter therefore specially visited Mr. Cui Lianggong, the person in charge of the Egg Industry Association in this city, and learned the following information.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Egg Industry Is Declining</h3>
<p>According to Cui, speaking to the reporter, the root cause of the gradual decline of the domestic egg industry is that European and American countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have recently increased import tariffs on fresh eggs. When the United States increased tariffs, the Chinese ambassador, Mr. Wu Chaoshu, negotiated several times but failed to obtain results. Therefore, taking advantage of the opening of the World Economic Conference, he submitted a request to the Chinese representatives attending the conference to request the conference to resolve it. The conference has closed, and the results will be known after the representatives return home. It is expected that there will still be no major progress in the future. As for the egg firms in Shanghai, there are four operated by foreigners: (1) Jardine Matheson, (2) Bandan, (3) Haines, and (4) ___________ Lin, etc. Among the Chinese businesses, the two with the largest sales are Maochang and Zhongyang. In short, the fundamental solution to the Chinese egg industry in the midst of this fierce economic competition among countries is to be able to produce and sell on its own. If others build high tariff barriers and we expect them to reduce tariffs in order to obtain subsidies, it is no different from seeking skin from a tiger. Moreover, after the abolition of likin in this country, fresh eggs exported must also pay export duties. Under these double taxes, the decline of the Chinese egg industry is to be expected. For example, the Philippines recently levied a tax on eggs, increasing it by nearly seven times, which is shocking. Looking back at the total value of eggs exported by China each year, the customs tax has been declining year by year, without exception. It is estimated that the total value was 43,779,000 customs taels in 1928, 51,720,000 customs taels in 1929, 51,161,000 customs taels in 1930, 37,757,500 customs taels in 1931, and will probably be worse in 1933 than in 1932. The memorandum of this association was sent to Mr. Bei Songsun, still issued on May 24th. At that time, it was feared that it would be difficult to receive, so the same document was sent in three copies, one directly to Mr. Bei, one sent via Siberia, and one transferred via South Manchuria."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Egg Taxes Levied by Various Countries</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked Cui about the contents of the memorandum. He showed the most important information about the egg taxes levied by countries such as the UK, USA, Germany, and Japan. (1) Regarding the United States, according to the US tariff regulations of 1913, fresh egg imports were completely tax-free, frozen eggs were taxed at US$0.02 per pound, and dried egg products were taxed at US$0.06 per pound. Afterwards, they were gradually increased, with fresh eggs increasing to US$0.10 per dozen (approximately 100% ad valorem) and frozen eggs increasing to US$0.11 per pound (approximately 100% ad valorem or more). Since the increase in tariffs, our country's fresh egg exports to the US have been cut off for more than ten years. Recently, frozen eggs have been reduced by nine-tenths and dried eggs by seven-tenths. (2) Regarding Japan, Japan initially exempted fresh egg imports from tax. Afterwards, each box of fresh eggs (approximately 300 pieces) was taxed at 1.30 Japanese yen (approximately 30% ad valorem). Chinese egg imports gradually decreased and have been cut off for more than three years. Recently, the tax rate has been increased to 2.10 yen. (3) Regarding the UK, the UK has a strong need for fresh egg and egg product imports. In the past, the import of the above items was completely tax-free. Last year, Australia and Canada had fresh eggs and egg products sent to the UK. In addition, there was some local production in the UK, so they began to collect a 10% import tax on fresh eggs and egg products from other countries. As a result, Chinese egg exports to the UK have also been significantly affected. (4) Regarding Germany, Germany increased tariffs heavily last year. For example, frozen whole eggs and frozen egg yolks were taxed at 65 marks per 100 kilos (200 kg) (approximately 90% ad valorem), frozen egg whites were taxed at 50 marks per 100 kilos (approximately 80% ad valorem), dried egg whites were taxed at 75 marks per 100 kilos (approximately 20% ad valorem), and frozen egg yolks were taxed at 65 marks per 100 kilos (approximately 100% ad valorem). Egg yolks were taxed at 65 marks per 100 kilos (approximately 50% ad valorem), and fresh eggs were taxed at 5 marks per 100 kilos, now changed to 70 marks (approximately 100% ad valorem). Chinese egg trade with Germany has therefore been greatly reduced. (5) Regarding France, our country's fresh egg trade with France has no transportation due to unsuitable prices. However, the tax on dried egg white water yellow original is 15%, now reduced to 25%, and frozen eggs have been increased from 2% to 4% since 1932. Now, a license tax of 400 francs (approximately 50% ad valorem) is added, thus suffering the same blow as egg products exported to Germany. (6) Regarding Italy, Italy also increased egg product import taxes last year, following other countries. Frozen whole eggs and frozen egg whites were taxed at 145 lire per 100 kilos (Italian currency, approximately 40% ad valorem), and frozen egg yolks and water yellow were taxed at 300 lire per 100 kilos (approximately 100% ad valorem). The tax rate is as harsh as Germany and France. Chinese egg exports to Italy are also significantly affected. (7) Regarding the Philippines, the Philippines taxed fresh egg imports at US$2 per 100 kilos. Last year, the new tax was changed to US$16, an increase of seven times, which has greatly impacted our country's fresh egg exports. Therefore, Chinese egg exports to the Philippines have decreased by more than 50%. Among the countries listed above, except for the UK, the import taxes on eggs and fresh egg products are unusually harsh, leading to the decline of our country's developing egg industry.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the Shuanggong Silk Factory</h3>
<p>| Wide Discrepancy in Opinions Between Labor and Management |</p>
<p>Fúlún and Hónglún Refuse to Grant Demands to Temporarily Stop Operations</p>
<p>Fourth and Sixth District Labor Unions Jointly Request Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>Among the Shuanggong silk factories in this city, only Fúlún and Hónglún remain. After the workers at Fúlún went on strike due to unsuccessful wage increase demands, several rounds of negotiations have failed to yield results due to significant differences of opinion. Hónglún has suspended operations in support of Fúlún. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Suspension of Business</h3>
<p>Workers at the Fúlún Shuanggong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road went on strike on the 12th of this month because the factory refused to increase their wages according to the standards of the Dānggōng factories. The Fourth District Silk Reeling Labor Union sent personnel to mediate, but it was ineffective. The factory stated that the price of Shuanggong silk was low, the sales were sluggish, and the raw silk needed was supposed to be provided by the Dānggōng factories, so the profits and losses were uncertain. They could not agree to the workers' demand for a seven-cent wage increase. Since the workers were not satisfied with the outcome, they did not work. The factory began distributing July wages yesterday. According to Shen Zuping, the manager of the factory, this was not the factory's intention to make things difficult, but they had their own difficulties. They had no choice but to distribute this month's wages and temporarily suspend operations.</p>
<h3>Sympathy and Assistance</h3>
<p>The Honglun and Shuanggong silk factories in Baziqiao, believing that the strike wave caused by the Fulun workers' demand for wage increases was a shared plight and feeling the sentiment of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold" and "when the rabbit dies, the fox grieves," began a work stoppage yesterday by ceasing to sound the steam whistle to awaken the workers. According to Song Zhenyang, the manager of the factory, the wages of Shuanggong have always been calculated at 80% of those of Dangong. Later, considering that the workers were conscientious in their work, the factory gradually increased wages voluntarily. By last year, the difference with Dangong was two cents (Dangong was 4.5 cents, and Shuanggong was 4.3 cents). This treatment was also intended as an incentive. During the recent strike wave of Dangong factory workers in Hongkou and Zhabei, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated and revised the wage to five cents. However, the Fulun workers wanted to increase their wages according to the same rate, completely disregarding the old practice of 80%. (If the Dangong wage of five cents were converted according to the old rate, the Shuanggong wage would be four cents.) If the management had any profit to be made, there would be no need for the workers to demand it. In reality, due to poor business conditions, the factory had no choice but to temporarily suspend operations to assist Fulun. Operations will resume as soon as progress is made.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Petition</h3>
<p>Silk Reeling Workers' Unions of the Fourth and Sixth Districts</p>
<p>Because the factory refused to increase wages and the workers insisted on their demands, mediation was ineffective. Despite attempts to persuade both labor and management to resume work, it was unsuccessful. They have now scheduled a joint petition to the Party and government authorities for mediation.</p>
<h3>Ma Su Visits Huang Jinrong</h3>
<p>National heroes Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen visited Mr. Huang Jinrong, a consultant to the Military Affairs Commission, at his Huang Family Garden in Caohejing at approximately 10 a.m. the day before yesterday. Mr. Huang personally received them and held an impromptu tea party, praising the two generals profusely. They conversed until 12 noon before parting.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Adds Gaohang Public Buses</h3>
<p>丨Elegant Design, Comfortable Seating丨</p>
<p>To promote integrated water and land transportation and actively develop transportation in Pudong, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau has been operating public buses from the Zeng Gaohang ferry terminal to Gaohang Town. The business is very prosperous. Recently, to extend the route directly to the seaside, the existing vehicles were insufficient. Therefore, two new public buses were manufactured. They have an elegant design and comfortable seating and use the official Ma Lawyer's public bus chassis. Because the chassis is low, passengers can easily get on and off. The center of gravity is low, and the ride is stable. The driver's position is next to the engine, and seats can be added. Compared to trucks used for passenger transport, they have at least the following advantages: (1) Wheelbase of 4.365 meters; (2) Total body length of 6.540 meters, width of 2.135 meters; (3) Chassis weight of 2450 kg; (4) Body weight of 1650 kg; (5) Passenger capacity of 35 people; (6) Engine power of RAC 248 horsepower; (7) The driver's position is next to the engine. Furthermore, the vehicle has doors and windows, including skylights. Regardless of the weather, the windows can be opened to allow air to circulate. The doors and windows are finely manufactured to eliminate vibration noise. The door switches use the latest German equipment. Comparing this to ordinary public buses that use a truck chassis, the difference in quality cannot be described. [L, &gt; Gaohang to public bus photography &lt;I,]</p>
<p>The body was originally planned to be manufactured using lead steel, but unfortunately, due to the short timeframe, it could not be completed, which is regrettable.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Fisheries Guidance Center Studies the Qidong Giant Turtle</h3>
<p>丨丨It is Not Strange that it is Called a Red Sea Turtle丨丨</p>
<p>In recent days, various newspapers have reported on the discovery of a giant turtle in Qidong, describing various strange circumstances. The Shanghai Fisheries Guidance Center, as the city's fisheries research institution, is very familiar with marine life. After reading the reports, it immediately sent personnel to investigate what it was and filmed it. It has now been confirmed that the turtle is called a red sea turtle, and it was crawling on the beach to lay eggs when it was caught by a Mr. Lu. The shape and habits of the turtle are briefly described below to prevent those who do not know it from considering it a mythical creature.</p>
<h3>Shape of the Turtle</h3>
<p>The turtle has an oval body, slightly wider in the front and narrower and pointed in the back. It has a large head and neck, a belly covered with fine scales, small eyes, and a hooked and curved beak. The tip of the snout is keratinous. The body is covered by two shells, dorsal and ventral, with 15 plates on the surface, five central lateral plates, and 25 marginal plates. The plates are tightly connected to each other, with a light reddish-brown color and a yellow interior. The larger ones are six to seven feet long. The front and hind limbs are paddle-shaped, each with a claw. The tail is very short. It lays eggs in June and July, landing on soft sand to dig a hole, laying eggs in it, and then covering them with soil. Each laying produces sixty to seventy eggs, up to a hundred and several tens. The eggs are almost perfectly round and hatch after sixty days. It is slow in nature, often eats fish and meat, and has an odor, making it inedible. However, its fat can be made into oil, and its shell can also be used. It is said that it is abundant in the East China Sea.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Man Wants to Buy</h3>
<p>When the center sent personnel to investigate, a Mr. Liang from Guangdong wanted to buy it for eighty yuan to release it. Initially, the center wanted to buy it for a few yuan to make a specimen, but seeing that someone wanted to buy it for a high price to release it, they ignored them and left.</p>
<h3>Sun Yufeng Injury Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Another Hearing Was Held by the Special First Court</p>
<p>Pan Yuchun Suspected of Perjury</p>
<p>Sun Yufeng, a young man from Tianjin, is 22 years old. He used to study at Tianjin High School but dropped out due to poverty. He then came to Shanghai to stay with his uncle, Li Fengming. Li Fengming had a daughter named Meilan, who was 28 years old. She had studied at a small school set up by the Catholic Church in Caojiadu. She was beautiful both inside and out, and her appearance was also lovely. Because she spent a long time with Sun Yufeng, their feelings became increasingly harmonious, and they even took a photo together to commemorate it. Later, Sun Yufeng was admitted to the Shanghai Telephone Company and was assigned to the West District on Metthrs Road. Because the location was very close to Li's house, they became more intimate. Recently, Li Fengming found out about it and strongly opposed it. He immediately took his daughter Meilan back to Tianjin and reprimanded and expelled Sun Yufeng. At the same time, he entrusted his relative Pan Yuchun to ask Sun Yufeng to return the photo of the two of them, but Sun sternly refused, causing resentment between them. Unexpectedly, at 9:43 p.m. on June 22nd of this year, when Sun Yufeng went to the company to handle affairs, he was suddenly splashed with nitric acid by someone. Sun's face, neck, back, and other parts were injured. The police sent him to the hospital for treatment. After being discharged from the hospital, Sun believed that this incident was instigated by Li Fengming, so he reported it to the Jing'an Temple Road police station. Detective Wang Yubin arrested Li Fengming and brought him to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Liu tried him once. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, it was time for another hearing. After the court opened, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu first stated that during the last court hearing, the defendant had stated that he and Liang and Xie were handling a real estate matter at No. 39 Sichuan Road that evening and then went to the Yadong Hotel to open a room and stay overnight. During the adjournment, the police went to No. 39 Tianshou Lane, North Sichuan Road, to investigate, but the place was Tang Shaoyi's residence. Mr. Liang was an accountant. According to Liang, the defendant and Xie did arrive at the place at 8 p.m. that evening to discuss real estate matters and went to the Yadong Hotel together after 10 p.m. The police also investigated at Yadong, and it was true. However, the police now determined that although the defendant was not present at the time, he was actually suspected of instigating the incident. Mr. Liang was not present in court today. According to the testimony of witness Pan Yuchun, he had been entrusted by the defendant to ask Sun Yufeng for the photos. However, he refused to reveal whether the defendant had made any intimidating remarks at the time. West Detective Laurie also testified, proving that Pan Yuchun had stated at the police station that the defendant had told Pan at the time that if Sun did not return the photos, there would be unfavorable consequences in the future. Now Pan refused to testify truthfully in court, indicating perjury. Furthermore, it was found that Li had a strong influence in the Central West District. Another important witness, Pan Yuxiu, was not present today, so a postponement should be requested. After Judge Liu Yugui verified the testimony, he ordered Li to be returned to custody. The case will be adjourned to investigate further. Afterwards, the police, suspecting that Pan Yuchun had committed perjury, detained him and prepared to request the Special District Court to approve his detention for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Negotiations and Interrogation Regarding the Case of American Soldier Killing Zhu Ronghai</h3>
<p>丨Lawyer Yu Xiufang Sends Letter to the American Commander丨</p>
<p>The case of Zhu Ronghai, a barber, who was run over by an American Marine Corps soldier riding a motorcycle on Gordon Road on July 5th, was treated but died on the 7th. The barber's guild and the father of the deceased have hired lawyer Yu Xiufang to negotiate according to the law. Yesterday, Lawyer Yu specially based on the facts of the incident and sent a letter to Mr. Braman, the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, requesting punishment for the American soldier who caused the accident and compensation for the loss. The original letter stated: General Braman, below, I have recently learned that you have been appointed to station in Shanghai. I am very happy to welcome your arrival. According to the statement of my client, Mr. Jinlai Shichun, the son of my client, Zhu Ronghai, passed through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road at around 4 p.m. on the 5th of this month, heading southwest. Unexpectedly, a soldier named Si Dai'ai from the U.S. Marine Corps at No. 50 Haifang Road was driving motorcycle No. 1876, heading south at high speed, and knocked my client's son, Zhu Ronghai, to the ground, seriously injuring the back of his head and causing a lot of bleeding. He could not speak immediately. The police at No. 2989 of the location informed the Jing'an Temple Police Station to order an investigation and send the vehicle to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died on the 7th of this month. The prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court of Shanghai confirmed the injuries on record. However, according to reports, the perpetrator Si Dai'ai stated in the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court of Shanghai that he was driving south that day and the deceased was walking from east to west, already crossing his vehicle, when another car came from the south. Seeing the car, he retreated again, so he could not brake in time and knocked him down. Two American soldiers who passed by witnessed it. After investigating, this statement in the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. At the time of the accident, my client's son was heading southwest, and Si Dai'ai's car crashed into him from behind, which is evident from the injury to the back of the deceased's head. Furthermore, no other vehicles were driving at that time, and no two American soldiers passed by Gordon Road. Yan Ajin was walking from west to east on Avenue Edward VII, turning onto the sidewalk on Gordon Road, and witnessed the tragedy. The people in the nearby shops saw it even more clearly. My client's son, Zhu Ronghai, was only 41 years old and came from a poor family, earning a living as a barber. My client is 71 years old. There is the deceased's wife and his six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter in the family, and the family of four relies entirely on the deceased for their livelihood. Now that Si Dai'ai has killed my client's son, how can the family's life be imagined? Two points are proposed, please help to prosecute according to the law: (1) Punish the perpetrator Si Dai'ai; (2) Have the perpetrator compensate for damages of six thousand three hundred and sixty yuan, calculated as follows: The living expenses of my family of four are calculated at ten yuan per person per month. My client is 71 years old this year and is calculated until he is 80 years old, totaling 1080 yuan. The widowed daughter-in-law is calculated until her son (currently six years old) is 20 years old and can support his mother, totaling 1680 yuan. My client's grandson is currently six years old and is calculated until he is 20 years old and can be independent, totaling 1680 yuan. My client's granddaughter is currently four years old and is calculated until she is 20 years old and married, totaling 1920 yuan. I respectfully hope that your country respects the rule of law and values humanity, and that the friendship between China and the United States is strong. Your Commander will surely have a satisfactory response to this unfortunate event. According to the above, a corresponding letter is sent, please investigate accordingly.</p>

<h3>Anti-Smuggling Patrol Boat Encountered Pirates on Baishan Waters</h3>
<p>Both Sides Confronted Each Other for an Hour</p>
<p>Captain Seriously Injured, Soldier Killed in Action</p>
<p>丨Injured Person Comes to Shanghai for Treatment丨</p>
<p>The Jiashan-Huzhou Joint Business Anti-Smuggling Camp in the Jiang-Zhe border area has a total of three patrol boats, which are stationed on the outer sea of Zhaopu and are responsible for patrolling the coast and protecting merchant ships. Previously (on the 17th), the three patrol boats departed from Zhaopu and patrolled along the coast. At 9:15, when patrolling the Baishan waters, they suddenly encountered six or seven canvas boats coming head-on. The patrol boats signaled to inquire, but the six or seven boats were pirate ships. As soon as they saw the patrol boat's signal, they immediately opened fire. Only then did the patrol boats realize that they had encountered pirates, so they also opened fire in retaliation. As a result, they confronted each other for an hour before the pirates were unable to withstand it and fled. Both the military and pirates suffered casualties. Xu Meiqing, the captain of the No. 3 Anti-Smuggling Boat, 33 years old, from Jinshan, was shot in the right neck, and the bullet penetrated. Soldier Wang Fugen, 30 years old, from Zhejiang, was fatally shot and died on the spot. The injured Xu Meiqing was immediately sent to Shanghai under the escort of Tang Renjie, the ship manager of the local Shengping Public Office. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he has been injured for too long and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>National Silk Exhibition Attracts Enthusiastic Visitors</h3>
<p>丨Statistics Reach Over 50,000 People Within Ten Days丨</p>
<p>The National Silk Exhibition has been open for more than ten days since its opening. The number of visitors is very enthusiastic, especially silk merchants along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai railways. There are also many ladies and gentlemen from various places. Because the domestic silk fabrics are constantly improving, people from all walks of life go to visit and make a standard in order to easily purchase them. The reporter met with the person in charge of the exhibition yesterday, who said that within ten days, the total number of visitors to the exhibition reached more than 53,470. There were so many inquiries about production and sales locations that they were almost unable to handle them. The association also specially set up Yongle Garden on the lower level to regulate the mood of tourists, with bird songs and flower shadows, which is very pleasant. The office specially set up by the Silk Industry Bank received savings of more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Construction of Vegetable Market on Chezhan Road Approved by Municipal Government for Industry Bureau to Investigate</h3>
<p>Merchants and vegetable vendors on Jiangyin Street in the South Shanghai District believe that the construction of a vegetable market on Chezhan Road will affect the livelihood of commercial vegetable vendors. On the 12th of this month, 14 representatives hired cars and went to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government to petition for the withdrawal of the order. Six people, including Du Jinbao, Xu Chunhua, Yan Hongxiang, Fan Gongliang, Yu Miaofa, and Zhou Gengsheng, were publicly elected to visit the Party and government authorities and personally stated that the construction of a vegetable market on Chezhan Road would not benefit the citizens, would lead to the bankruptcy of businesses on Jiangyin Street, and would cause vegetable vendors to lose money. If the aim is to prosper the market on Chezhan Road, other plans can be carried out. The authorities accepted this. Yesterday, the Municipal Government issued a reply to this case, No. 1194, stating that the original petition from the Jiangyin Street merchants and residents, Du Jinbao, etc., was submitted, requesting that the Industry Bureau withdraw the order to construct a vegetable market on the Nan Chezhan Hou Road and not start construction. It has been learned that the Industry Bureau should be ordered to investigate the matter. This reply, July 19th, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Mayor Wu. After receiving the reply, the chief representative Du immediately informed the representatives to inform all merchants and vegetable vendors.</p>
<h3>Xu Yongzuo, Certified Public Accountant, Audits the Final Accounts of the Silk Industry Savings Department</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Savings Department of the Hankou Road Silk Industry Bank has developed its business and established a strong reputation. Its final accounts for the previous year have been prepared by Xu Yongzuo, CPA, and reported, stating that the business performance of the Savings Department of the Silk Industry Bank in the second year has been improved compared with the previous year. Various savings deposits have increased, especially fixed deposits and Class B current deposits. However, various expenses have decreased, so the net profit has increased more than twofold compared with the previous year. All loan collateral, bonds, and cash in the warehouse have been jointly reviewed and found to be correct in the recent period. The loan collateral is reliable. The book value of the bonds is 59,400 yuan, but the market value is 80,000 yuan, which is calculated at a 75% discount, which is healthy. This is certified, etc. Recently, on the occasion of the bank's expansion anniversary, new depositors will receive gifts according to the gift rules, such as wallets, embroidered fans, and silk scarves. It is also learned that Huaxin Printing and Dyeing Company, in commemoration of its opening, has specially printed 200 silk garments using the latest machines and entrusted the bank to distribute them as gifts. All depositors who deposit more than 500 yuan in fixed deposits for one year at the bank will receive a silk garment.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Prohibits Tobacco Companies from Giving Away Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Stating that it Hampers the Promotion of Construction Lottery Tickets</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Orders Prohibitions in All Districts</p>
<p>Guomin News said that recently, newspapers in Shanghai published full-page advertisements for the Betel Nut brand cigarettes manufactured by the China Huadong Tobacco Company. Accumulating five empty boxes of the brand can be exchanged for one lottery ticket, which is awarded in different grades. The first prize is 5,000 yuan, and the prizes are awarded according to the numbers drawn for the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets on July 31st, 22nd year of the Republic of China. This is equivalent to publicly issuing sub-tickets, which has a great impact on the promotion of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets. The general manager of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Dayun Company, has reported the matter to the office of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets and requested that it be urgently banned to prevent abuses. A reporter from Guomin News learned that the Ministry of Finance initially issued the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan and submitted it to the 339th meeting of the Central Political Conference. This construction lottery ticket was handled by emulating the examples of central governments in Europe, South American countries, and Australia in issuing lottery tickets to carry out construction. It was issued with the special approval of the government. Now that it is being actively promoted, the government believes that no other organizations, groups, companies, or stores should be allowed to cite it. Now, the Company Brand Champagne Tickets of the Hualun Tobacco Company, the Formosa Brand Promotional Tickets of the Fuxin Tobacco Company, the Golden Arrow Brand Sales Tickets of the Huapin Tobacco Company, and the Gao Erfu Gift Tickets of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company, although different in name, all give cash prizes. All cash prizes, regardless of the lottery method, should be prohibited to avoid hindering the promotion of the National Government Construction Lottery Tickets. Therefore, five copies of the newspaper were collected on the previous day and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to request that it be transferred to the relevant companies for compliance and that the cash prize method be canceled as soon as possible. If it is for commercial competition, other methods of attracting customers should also be planned, but cash rewards should not be used to customers, and the principle should be that it does not hinder the government's construction plan. In the future, if other tobacco companies and commercial firms still have similar gift awards, the Municipal Government is requested to pay special attention to them and severely prohibit them at any time. After reviewing the letter, Mayor Wu immediately ordered the Social Affairs Bureau of the Public Security Bureau to prohibit them yesterday. It is reported that the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, has issued orders to the district offices to prohibit them and informed all tobacco companies to comply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation of the Thirty-Second District Branch Establishes Free Summer Clinic</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee members of the Thirty-Second District Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizen's Federation, including Cheng Xiechun, Cai Qiajun, Li Zhiyun, Chen Youyun, and Zhu Zhuxian, believing that summer epidemics are prevalent and to facilitate the treatment of diseases among the poor, have specially hired: (1) Dr. Zhu Nanshan, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. every day, at Tongdechun Pharmacy on North Xizang Road; (2) Dr. Lu Qiaoxian, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. every day, at Xinyi Printing House, No. 142 Qipu Road; (3) Dr. Chen Zhongping, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day, at No. 20 Dexingfang, behind the New Yamen on Gansu Road; (4) Dr. Ding Jiwan, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day, at Renheli, Shanjia Garden, Baker Road, as free summer clinics. Any citizen of the district who is sick can go to the association at No. 245 Qiaxingli, Kaifeng Road, North Xizang Road, to obtain a consultation voucher and go for treatment free of charge. The association also has emergency epidemic medicines and scarlatina water available for patients to claim.</p>
<h3>Suspects in the Assassination of Song Jiaoren, Wang Shuqiao, etc., Detained by Police Team</h3>
<p>Long Lin and Tang Ming Are Acquainted</p>
<p>The Truth Will Soon Come Out</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese and Western detectives from the Old Gate Police Station in the Public Concession successively arrested four suspects in the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Zhou Zhizhang, Hong Yaodou, Wang Shuqiao, and Niu Anru from Anhui. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate that the suspects were related to the attempted assassination of Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station last year, when stray bullets killed Secretary Tang Yulu. Therefore, the Special First Court was invited to the case for trial. Investigators from the Detective Team brought the four suspects to the bureau in court. They were then transferred to the Third Squadron of the Police Brigade under the bureau's jurisdiction in Huoshen Temple, Dadongmen, for temporary custody. The squadron sent several police officers to guard them day and night, very strictly. Director Wen believed that the case was important, and no one was allowed to visit to prevent accidents. It is now known that Long Lin and Tang Ming, who were related to the Song case, have been detained in the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau for ten months. When Zhou Zhizhang and the other four were brought to the team the other day, Wang Shuqiao and Hong Yaodou were acquainted with Long Lin and Tang Ming, except for Zhou Zhizhang and Niu Anru. According to Secretary Wen of the bureau yesterday, Director Wen is currently conducting an examination according to the law and will hand it over to the interrogation section of the Third Division for strict interrogation. The truth will soon come out.</p>

<h3>Liu Wenhui and Sichuan Gentry Telegraph for Cessation of War, Requesting Control of Sichuan War</h3>
<p>The Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War received a joint telegram yesterday from Liu Wenhui and Sichuan gentry, including Yin Changheng, all requesting an appeal for the cessation of civil war. The two telegrams are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from Liu Wenhui</h3>
<p>To the esteemed gentlemen of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War in Shanghai: I have received your kind telegram. The current chaotic situation in Sichuan is due to my inadequacy as the Provincial Governor to effectively manage and rectify the situation, for which I cannot shirk responsibility. However, the main instigator is none other than Liu Xiang. The events of the year of Renshen are clearly evident and were foreseen by your esteemed association. The recent conflict between my troops and Deng's troops under Huang Yimin was initially authorized by Xiang under the guise of defending against the Reds for survival. His subsequent support for Deng's counterattack was also plotted by Xiang. Those who are insightful within the situation are aware of this. I have briefly outlined the circumstances in previous telegrams, which I trust have reached you. I, Wenhui, have limited experience and made occasional missteps. I complied with the order to cease operations, hoping to restore peace. However, despite my repeated concessions and compliance with the order to cease hostilities and suppress bandits, Xiang has consistently manipulated the situation and deliberately fueled the conflict. I am deeply concerned about national affairs and the scourge of banditry. I have made every effort to accommodate, hoping to end the use of force. On several occasions in June, I telegraphed Xiang, expressing my willingness to sacrifice my own position and go to Chongqing for instruction. I also offered to hand over all my troops for his reorganization and deployment, supporting his efforts to unify Sichuan's military and administrative power, aiming to implement the Central Government's repeated orders to cease conflict and suppress bandits. I detailed this extensively in each telegram, which I believe you have already reviewed. However, Xiang, having already resolved to use force, ignored my repeated telegrams. He made no effort to reconcile the generals or comply with the order to suppress bandits. Instead, he launched a major offensive westward, single-mindedly creating a civil war. To uphold my initial commitment to peace, I was compelled to abandon Renshou, Jianyang, Jingyan, and the salt-producing areas of Jianle without resistance. On the Geng day, I left Chengdu, leading my troops to relocate to the right bank of the Min River. I also issued a public telegram resigning from my concurrent positions as Chairman of the Provincial Government, clearly demonstrating my sincerity in pursuing peace and concession, awaiting the Central Government's decision and the public's judgment. I believed that this would prompt him to pull back from the brink, transforming hostility into harmony. However, the day after I left Chengdu, Xiang's aircraft began bombing, and he continued to launch attacks with land, sea, and air forces on Jiading, Meishan, and Pengshan counties. Simultaneously, Deng Xihou's troops launched a forceful offensive towards Shuangliu, creating a situation where a second major bloody battle would be unavoidable, inevitably leading to the complete Reddening of Sichuan. My abilities are limited, and my governance of Sichuan has been inadequate. I have failed to awaken Xiang's conscience, leading to repeated armed conflicts, which is regrettable. However, Xiang disregards the Central Government's order to cease conflict and suppress bandits and turns a deaf ear to the advice of your esteemed association and the nation. This is a tragedy for national principles and social morale. In addition to telegraphed reports to the Central Government, urging them to promptly take measures to stop it, I earnestly request that your esteemed association, based on your love for Sichuan and the nation, find a way to restrain the violent, stop this meaningless internal strife, avoid creating opportunities for the Communists, directly preserve a glimmer of hope for the people of Sichuan, indirectly preserve a portion of the nation's principles, and reverse this deteriorating trend. The telegram is urgent, and I await your wise counsel. Respectfully, Liu Wenhui.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Sichuan Gentry</h3>
<p>(Omitted titles) Since the great war last year, the people of Sichuan have suffered immensely, displaced and in unspeakable pain. Before their shock could subside, the flames of war have reignited. If circumstances permitted and the military action had legitimate cause, the people could temporarily endure it. However, the Red bandits are rampant, like a raging tide. Counties such as Tongjiang, Najiang, and Bazhong have been captured and lost repeatedly. Qingyuan, Cangxi, Yilong, and Langzhong counties have fallen one after another. Local bandits have again raised their red flags and engaged in arson and plunder. Crisis abounds, and danger lurks everywhere. Last year, the military leaders presented a plan for governing Sichuan, and the people hoped that the end of the civil war would allow it to be implemented. However, the actions of the various armies contradicted their words, becoming even more severe, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and attacking the people, creating opportunities for the Red bandits. If they promptly changed course and worked together to suppress the bandits, the situation might not have spiraled out of control. Instead, they have turned against each other, harboring deep hatred, engaging in internecine strife, and abandoning the responsibility of suppressing bandits. They call it unifying before suppressing the Reds, but in reality, unification may not be achieved, while the Red scourge spreads like wildfire. The seventy million people of Sichuan are trapped in an irrecoverable situation. Moreover, if the armies were united in suppressing the Reds, supporting and relying on each other, transitioning from disunity to unity, it would be an excellent opportunity to unify the entire province. Instead of pursuing this, they engage in internal strife, fueling the fire and deepening the water. How can they justify this to their conscience? We, the remaining survivors of this ravaged land, are deeply alarmed by the impending disaster. Therefore, we implore our fellow countrymen across the nation to offer assistance and earnestly request the Central Government to dispatch commissioners to Sichuan to effectively stop the Sichuan war and strictly order all troops to wholeheartedly suppress the Reds, working together to achieve complete success. This may give the people of Sichuan, who are on the brink of despair, a chance to survive. Otherwise, if the entire province falls to the Reds, the damage will be even greater than in Jiangxi. If the Red bandits gain control of this strategic region, the disaster will spread throughout the nation. By the time efforts are made to recover, it will be too late. The situation is urgent, and we cannot help but cry out in distress. We humbly request your examination.

<h3>Valuable Historical Document Discovered in American Consular Court</h3>
<p>The *Great American Evening News* reports that He Weishi, a clerk at the American Consular Court in this city, was organizing the court's archives when he discovered a letter of appointment signed by President Madison 121 years ago. It is currently stored in the American Consulate, awaiting descendants of the document's owner to claim it. The letter appoints White as a lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of Artillery, signed by President Madison on July 23, 1812, and countersigned by Secretary of State Eustis. This year was the time of the last Anglo-American War, and White's appointment likely meant he joined the war. At that time, the United States had only sixteen states, so the flag on the letter of appointment had only sixteen stars. The military equipment of that time, besides flintlock muskets, included powerful bows and strong crossbows, which cannot be compared with today's airplanes and artillery. It is unknown how this document ended up in Shanghai and in the archives of the American Consular Court. He Weishi speculates that perhaps one of his descendants was a sailor who died in Shanghai, leading to it being turned over to the authorities. There is a note on the back of the letter of appointment intended for his descendants, written by White in 1841, bequeathing it to his only daughter, Huilian, who in turn bequeathed it to her grandson in 1859.</p>

<h3>Issue of Canceling Telephone Call Fees</h3>
<p>Letter from the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, regarding the matter of canceling the five-cent fee for Chinese-foreign telephone calls, has sent letters to the French Municipal Council and the telephone company, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have recently received a letter from our Executive Committee member, Mr. Qu Zhenhua, in his capacity as a telephone subscriber, requesting us to write to your Municipal Council and forward it to the Shanghai Telephone Company, asking them to offer friendly advice. The Chinese telephone bureau has already automatically canceled the five-cent fee for Chinese-foreign calls. We have repeatedly requested the Shanghai Telephone Company to make a similar gesture, but the company has consistently insisted on maintaining the fee, with no hope of a solution. It is well known that the longer the lines, the more subscribers will eagerly install telephones for their convenience, which is in line with the goals of opening up and equal opportunity. If the company insists on its own opinion and is determined to fulfill its previous statements, it would be like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword dropped overboard, which is of no benefit to the facts. Anyone who understands the general trend deeply disapproves of the company's obstinacy. Having examined the provisions of Article 3, Section 3 of the contract between the company and the subscribers, your bureau has the right to participate in the modification of telephone rates. Therefore, we are entrusting you to forward this letter to your bureau, explaining everything to the company and urging them not to adhere to their own opinions, lest they disappoint the expectations of the majority of subscribers, etc." We are forwarding this letter as a matter of courtesy, and we would be grateful if you would look into it and take appropriate action.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Did Not Discuss Factory Inspection Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that negotiations on factory inspection in the International Settlement have progressed after Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Director-General Fessenden of the Shanghai Municipal Council held further discussions the other day, with opinions converging. Regarding the implementation methods, both sides have agreed and are now reporting to their respective authorities.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors held its regular meeting. Fessenden had originally planned to report to the board on the details of the agreement reached and obtain their understanding. However, because the official letter from Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to Fessenden was only received yesterday afternoon, Fessenden stated at the board meeting that he had not had sufficient time to study it due to the late receipt of Yu's official letter. Therefore, he postponed the report to the next meeting. The Board of Directors adjourned without further discussion. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, the next meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors will be held on August 2. After that, there will be a summer recess. The Shanghai Municipal Government will also have to wait for instructions from the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan.

<h3>Xu Yunzhi Sues Husband for Bigamy and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Chen Jiayan, residing at 23 Mingdelu, Fuxu Road in the French Concession, has recently been sued by his wife, Xu Yunzhi, for bigamy, abandonment, and alleged abuse, in the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment for alimony and education expenses for their daughter in the amount of 280,000 yuan. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for the trial. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court for the hearing. According to Xu Yunzhi, Chen Jiayan's father was a prominent Shanghai banker who amassed millions of dollars in wealth and once operated the Yixing Money Shop. She married Chen in 1926, and the marriage was initially harmonious. They had a daughter named Cijuan, who is now seven years old. After her father-in-law's death, her husband began an affair with another woman, taking her as a concubine. In 1930, after the concubine's death, he married a woman with the surname Chen in Hangzhou and brought her to Shanghai, renting a house to live with her. When she argued with him, Chen claimed that he was taking her as a concubine. Recently, he brought the woman home and treated her as his wife. Xu became angry and moved out, staying with relatives. At the same time, she filed a lawsuit. According to Chen Jiayan, he has treated his wife well and has not abused her. The plaintiff has simply been misled by others and filed the lawsuit. Therefore, he is unwilling to divorce. The two parties are currently undergoing reconciliation procedures and are requesting the court to postpone the hearing. The court also believed that divorce is the most painful thing in life, and it would be best if both parties could forgive each other and reconcile, so that the marriage would not be dissolved. Therefore, the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Worker Commits Suicide by Poisoning After Romantic Affair Is Discovered</h3>
<p>Yu Shaoli, a 49-year-old worker from Shaoxing at the Xinxin Silk Weaving Factory on Kangdi Road, Malan Road in the French Concession, had a lover, Chen Qiu'e, a 23-year-old from Dongyang. Chen's husband lives at home and has children, but their affair has recently been discovered by the factory. The factory advised Yu to break off the relationship with the woman. However, Yu was deeply in love and ignored their advice. Recently, for its own sake, the factory dismissed Yu Shaoli and gave him travel expenses to return to his hometown. Yu, distressed by this setback, became preoccupied and contemplated suicide. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., he swallowed raw opium and attempted suicide. Friends noticed and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died at around 7:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Case to Confirm Daughter's Identity Awaits Judgment</h3>
<p>Gu Naijuan, the daughter of Gu Pinjian, the owner of the Zhengtai Cotton Yarn Shop on Beijing Road, previously requested that her father, Gu Pinjian, take her home to live with him, but Gu refused. She then hired lawyers Jiang Chiping and Qiu Fenling to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting that Gu Pinjian be ordered to confirm her identity as his daughter. The case has been heard several times by Judge Luo Chongtai, but due to the examination of witnesses, a decision has not been reached. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., the hearing was scheduled to continue. The defendant, Gu Pinjian, did not appear, but Gu's brother, Gu Mengchao, was summoned to testify. According to his testimony, his younger brother, Gu Pinjian, did marry Ms. Lu in September 1923 and Ms. Lu gave birth to Naijuan in October 1924. He also stated that after Ms. Lu divorced his younger brother, Naijuan was fostered at the home of her uncle, Pu Zhijun, and later at the home of Wang Baosheng, a friend of his younger brother. All of Naijuan's living expenses were borne by Gu Pinjian. Judge Luo then briefly questioned Gu Naijuan and her mother, Ms. Lu, and their statements were the same as before. At this point, the lawyers for both sides began to argue, but the defendant's representative lawyer, Ye Fokang, did not appear. Only the plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Chiping, presented various legal principles. Judge Luo then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the morning of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Large Group of Notorious Thieves Investigated for Repeated Robberies</h3>
<p>Hongkou Police Station Detective Chief Shi Si and Detective Bao Shuji apprehended a large number of thieves on Tangshan Road, Fujian Road, and Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession the other day. The thieves, namely Xu Xueshu, Wang Jinsheng, Hong Kaida, Chen Asan, Wu Genfa, Wang Zigen, Wu Lisheng, and Zeng Jinbin (eight in total), were found with twenty pistols and eight bullets. They were taken to the police station and detained. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the background of the case, claiming that the investigation revealed that the defendants, on May 27 of this year, armed themselves and colluded to rob the Chen family at No. 12 Songshou Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, of their property. The case was orchestrated by the defendant Wu Lisheng, who previously worked as a clerk in Chen's bookstore and knew that the Chen family had money, hence this action. The defendants were also involved in a robbery case near Waibaidu Bridge. The police station needs to conduct a detailed investigation of each defendant and request an extension for another case, to keep them in custody for the time being, etc. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection.

<h3>Two Russian Suspects in Siberia Jewelry Company Heist Released</h3>

<p>Judge Feng Shide reported and approved the release of the defendants Karl and Sisi.</p>
<h3>Pujiang Hoodlums Forcibly Rob and Extort Watermelon Boats</h3>
<p>Small Vendors Cry Out in Suffering</p>
<p>Local Officials Take Note</p>
<p>Recently, in the Longhua area of southern Huangpu, there have been hoodlums hiring small boats to intercept cargo ships sailing to Shanghai in the Pujiang River. They demand "customary fees," ranging from three to four yuan for larger boats to one yuan or seven to eight jiao for smaller boats. If their demands are not met, they block the ships from sailing, acting aggressively. Seeing the large number of hoodlums, the boatmen have no choice but to comply. Since the summer, watermelons have been on the market, and boatmen transport them to Shanghai for sale, numbering dozens of boats daily. Therefore, these hoodlums see it as a great source of income, hiring boats to wait in the Pujiang River day and night. Upon seeing a watermelon boat, they intercept it and extort money. The boatmen, needing to sell their goods during the summer season, cannot delay and have no choice but to pay the demanded amount. Moreover, the hoodlums forcibly take more than ten or several watermelons, considering it a "rule." Therefore, the amount extorted from watermelon boats is even greater, ranging from five to six yuan per boat. If the boatmen have no money to pay, the hoodlums forcibly take the watermelons to cover the "expenses." On the 14th of this month, a watermelon vendor named Dong Maoting bought seven hundred watermelons in Tangxi and hired a rural boat to transport them to Shanghai. Dong was on board escorting the goods when, upon reaching the Pujiang River eighteen miles away, a group of ten or more hoodlums, hiring three small boats, parked there. Upon seeing Dong's boat, the three small boats immediately followed and swarmed aboard, acting extremely angry. They beat the boatmen and dragged the boat to the riverbank, demanding ten yuan in "expenses" from Dong. Dong said that there was no such charge, and if they wanted money, they should go to the Shanghai government to demand it. The hoodlums became furious, beat Dong, and detained the boat there for a day and a night. Later, after persuasion from other watermelon boats, Dong paid five yuan and had seven or eight watermelons forcibly taken before being allowed to sail to Shanghai. Suddenly, the day before yesterday afternoon, a boat carrying four hundred watermelons, owned by Shan Yuanji, was also intercepted there. The hoodlums demanded "expenses," and Shan gave them one yuan, saying that it was the only yuan on the boat, and he would pay the rest next time. The hoodlums did not believe him and searched the boat but found nothing. They forcibly took twenty watermelons. Shan refused, and the hoodlums forcibly moved the watermelons. Shan cried out for help, and the hoodlums, enraged, punched and kicked him. At that time, several boats were sailing by, and the hoodlums threw dozens of watermelons from Shan's boat into the Pujiang River and punctured three holes in the boat before fleeing in the small boats. Shan's boat, with holes punctured in it, could not sail to Shanghai, so he hired another boat to transfer the watermelons and transport them to Shanghai, and reported the incident to the police. It is unknown if the hoodlums will be apprehended.</p>
<h3>Assault and Injury of Foreman Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>Workers from the China Huadong Tobacco Company on Tangshan Road, due to a dispute at 6:30 AM on the 2nd of this month, assaulted the foreman, Yong native Shen Amao, causing him to fall to the ground. Officers No. 1344 and No. 1721 arrived at the scene and arrested the suspects, Tongzhou natives Mu Jintao, Li Duihua, Li Ronggui, Chen Musheng, and Zhu Zhuming, and took them to the Huishan Police Station. The injured Shen Amao was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The next morning, the police station sent the defendants to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan came to the court to hear the case. The factory manager, for the sake of settling the matter, paid Shen Amao one hundred yuan for medical expenses. Shen Amao was discharged from the hospital on the 14th and returned to his hometown that night due to his father's illness. He drafted a withdrawal statement and instructed his younger brother, Shen Kaifa, to bring it to the court to request dismissal of the case. The factory commissioned lawyer Wu Linkun to attend and state the reasons, requesting the release of the defendants, stating that the minor injury charge under Article 293 of the Criminal Code could be withdrawn. Judge Wu then announced that the case was not accepted, and the five defendants, Mu Jintao, et al., were released.</p>

<h3>University of Paris Hires Wu Kang as Professor</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Kang (Zi: Jingxuan, native of Pingyuan, Guangdong), Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Professor of Philosophy at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, has profound research in Chinese and Western literature and philosophy and enjoys a high reputation in European academic circles. Recently, the University of Paris invited Mr. Wu to serve as a specialist professor. The French Consulate General in Shamian, Guangzhou, sent an official letter to Mr. Wu at the end of June, stating that it had received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, informing that the Administrative Council of the Chinese College of the University of Paris had decided to hire him as a specialist teaching professor. The University of Paris is the center of Western European academic civilization, a gathering place for talent and a hub of learning. This is the first time it has officially hired a Chinese person to teach courses. Mr. Wu previously published a book in French, "A Theory of Politics in the Spring and Autumn Period" (published by the Le Roux Publishing House in Paris), which was highly praised by European scholars. Famous oriental scholars in Paris, such as Paul Pelliot, Marcel Granet, and Henri Maspero, admired its breadth, elegance, and detail, comparing it to the writings of Édouard Chavannes. (Chavannes was a leading figure in the history of Chinese studies in Europe.) Recently, the "Journal Asiatique" in Paris, the "International Review," the "Revue Franco-Chinoise" of the Sino-French University in Lyon, and the "Deutsche Großasien-Zeitschrift" in Germany have all published articles by experts introducing the book as a great work in international academia. However, it is reported that Mr. Wu has been back in China for less than a year, and is currently occupied with his duties at Sun Yat-sen University and his personal family and marital affairs (it is rumored that Mr. Wu will come to Shanghai in the summer to marry Ms. Li Shuliu of Yuzhang). He plans to postpone accepting the appointment from Paris and will not travel to the West for the time being within a year.</p>

<h3>Night Garden of the Municipal People's Education Center to Change Opening Method</h3>
<p>Due to Overcrowding</p>
<p>Rumor that Admission Tickets Will Be Charged</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center specially opened the garden scenery part at night to meet the needs of the public to escape the summer heat in the evening. It has been implemented since the 15th of this month. The number of visitors at night is extremely crowded. The exhaled air forms clouds, and sweat is like rain. There is a lot of overcrowding.

<h3>Lectures at the Shanghai Art College Summer Workshop</h3>
<p>Director Pan Delivers a Lecture on the Education Situation in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Summer Art Teachers' Workshop, organized by the Shanghai Art College, began its lectures on the 17th. The students in each group come from far away and are all middle school art teachers, totaling more than 150 people. Yesterday afternoon, the first special lecture was held, with Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, lecturing on the education situation in the city. He stated that there are three major tools for education: schools, newspapers, and movies. Judging from the current educational perspective in Shanghai, although schools are numerous, there are not many that are well-managed. Judging from the results of this conference examination, most schools at all levels fail in arithmetic and natural sciences, which proves that the school equipment is simple and cannot meet the needs of society. Students are unwilling to put in basic efforts, so the science education in our country cannot be developed. Although newspapers in the city are like bamboo shoots after rain, very few can be run based on the educational stand. For example, the social news column magnifies the words about robbery, rape, and all the base and dark things every day, which has a great impact on the majority of ignorant people and young people with weak intentions. Most of the movies in the city come from overseas and are mostly films of extravagance and indulgence, which do not fit the current social situation of our country. From the perspective of these three educational tools, the education in Shanghai in the past has been a failure. In the future, we should urgently seek reform to save this crisis. It is also rumored that the second lecture will be held at 4 p.m. today, with Liu Haisu, the president of the association, lecturing on the topic of "Modern Art Trends."</p>
<h3>Appointment of Important Staff at Pudong Middle School</h3>

The remaining faculty and staff are also being sought. It is reported that the school attaches great importance to talent and experience in hiring faculty and staff this time.</p>
<h3>Lehua Girls' Middle School to Build School Buildings</h3>
<p>Lehua Girls' Middle School on Avenue Foch is founded by Mr. Chen Yafu. There are currently nearly 300 students. In this semester, female students from the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Hunan have enrolled and studied with great enthusiasm. School Director Yang Binghang, in view of the fact that leased school buildings are not enough to use various equipment, and cannot be expanded, now seeks to lay the foundation on the rock-solid name of An, and generously donates 20,000 yuan alone. School Directors Yang Qiusun, Yang Xinzheng, Yang Zixiong, Shen Yuetang, Wang Fengqi, Wang Rujue, Zhang Youren, etc. from Shanghai's western gentry, donated 30,000 yuan and plan to ask the Education Bureau to allocate the accumulated grain warehouse land to serve as the school base and build school buildings on their own. On the 26th of this month, a fundraising committee for the construction of school buildings will be convened to carry out the work.</p>

<h3>Chinese Team Wins the Grass Tennis League Championship</h3>
<p>Chinese Team Defeated Xieqiao Yesterday by a Score of 12 to 3</p>
<p>Next Time, Even if the Chinese Team Suffers a Complete Defeat, it Will Not Affect the Championship</p>
<p>The Shanghai Westerners' Grass Tennis Association's League Competition, which has been underway since the start of the season, will end next Wednesday. The seventh competition was held yesterday, and the Chinese team again defeated the Xieqiao General Association by a score of 12 to 3. At the same time, the Japanese Inside and Outside Yarn Factory, which was able to compete with the Chinese team, lost to the North Grassland team by a score of 5 to 10 yesterday, so the hopes of the Inside and Outside Factory were dashed, and the Chinese team sat firmly on the champion's throne for the first time.</p>
<h3>Results of Yesterday's Four Matches</h3>
<p>Yesterday's battle between the Chinese team and Xieqiao was undoubtedly a victory for the Chinese team, but the five groups failed to win all, and the third group lost by a score of one to two. The second group lost another set, resulting in a final score of 12 to 3. The unexpected result was that the Inside and Outside Factory, which has always been cunning and tenacious, was defeated by the North Grassland team by a score of 10 to 5, and the South Grassland team's defeat by the Portuguese team by a score of 5 to 10 was also unexpected. The Japanese team defeated the Flagship Country General Association by a score of 10 to 2. There is still one group in this game that has not been played.</p>
<h3>Chinese Team Secure Championship</h3>
<p>The Chinese team has never tasted the championship in the grass league. Every year, there is hope for the championship, but it always fails due to the inability to maintain focus from beginning to end. The championships in the past three years have belonged to the Japanese team. This year, the strength of the Japanese team has been dispersed to the Inside and Outside Factory, which has been in a slump. The strength of the Inside and Outside Factory has suddenly become strong, making it a strong enemy of the Chinese team. The talent of the Chinese team is the most complete this year, so it has the determination to win. Every battle is a victory, and hope is increasing. Yesterday, after the Chinese team defeated the Xieqiao Association by a score of 12 to 3, the hope for the championship was secured, and the defeat of the Inside and Outside Factory made the Chinese team even more confident of taking the throne.</p>
<h3>Chinese Team Results Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Last Four Matches</h3>
<p>Next Wednesday (26th) will be the last four matches. The opponent of the Chinese Association is the French Business Association. Judging from the current situation, even if the Chinese Association loses all 15 points, it will not affect the championship. The North Grassland's competition has ended. The Inside and Outside Factory and Portugal are now tied. Even if the two teams each win all with a score of 15, they can only be tied for second place and cannot grab the Chinese throne. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>French Business Association vs. Chinese Association at the French Business Association</p>
<p>South Grassland vs. Japanese Association at the South Grassland</p>
<p>Inside and Outside Factory vs. Flagship Association at the Inside and Outside Factory</p>

<h3>Summer Football League Cancelled</h3>
<p>Baseball League Also Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Last year, in order to improve winter football skills and popularize football, the Chinese National Sports Association initiated the Summer Football Competition. Many people joined, and every time the sun set and the evening breeze came, the players and spectators were as interested as in winter. In the end, the Lingnan team won the championship, and the Huadong Company team lost miserably by one goal. The Sports Association originally planned to continue the competition every summer in the future. Therefore, up to this summer, the teams were preparing to show their skills in the summer competition. However, the National Sports Association has changed its purpose this year. In view of the fact that baseball in the sea is about to be eliminated, it is planned to renovate baseball. Initially, it contacted the baseball teams of universities such as Jiaotong, Fudan, and St. John's, and planned to initiate a joint baseball competition. The baseball field was dismantled and the wire mesh was removed to prepare for the baseball competition. However, since the summer vacation of the schools, the players have been scattered and unable to gather, so the baseball competition has invisibly stopped. But the baseball field bleachers and wire mesh have been dismantled, and the cost of reinstallation is not small, so this year's summer football competition had to be cancelled.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Maritime Ornament</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Some say that our country's navy was almost entirely wiped out after the Sino-Japanese War. The total tonnage we have now is also very limited. Compared with the navies of the world's major powers, it is truly a "concrete example" of "being dwarfed." In terms of "repelling foreign enemies," we feel that our strength is insufficient, and in terms of "pacifying domestic unrest," we have no place to use our strength. On weekdays, besides "firing salutes," "transporting ______," and "providing rides for important people," it is simply of little use. It's just cruising the sea and acting as an "ornament."</p>
<p>I say, I'm afraid that's not necessarily true! Even if we were to be maritime ornaments, it wouldn't be easy to be ornaments that look the part. Because our country's coastline is very long, if we were to arrange them step by step, layer by layer, where would we find so many fleets for you to decorate with? Moreover, the coastal areas of our country and the Yangtze River area already have magnificent navies from various countries to defend you and decorate for you, so you don't need to worry about it yourself. Therefore, this "goldfish-like" navy (foreigners often mock our country's navy as being like goldfish) can only be a nominal ornament of the "Republic of China," and it is really not even qualified to be a "maritime ornament."</p>
<p>Speaking of the organization of our country's navy, the factions are different. It has always been unique, and most of them are not subject to central dispatch, which is also a strange and distorted state of the country. Recently, the three ships stationed in "Qingdao," including the "Haiqi," suddenly declared themselves missing due to internal disagreements. It has already been proven that they sailed into the "Pearl River" and were incorporated by the Guangdong side. Then, the three ships parked at "Dagu Estuary," including the "Chuyu," also acted freely. The navy's fickleness is truly dazzling and baffling. In fact, according to our petty commoners' views, no matter whether you change to the east or to the west, it's all within the scope of the Republic of China anyway. But for the foreign</p>
<p>big shots to see, they will again say that these "goldfish" swimming around are too free, "beyond the reach" of any country!</p>
<h3>Night Scene of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>— Huo Xue Ming</p>
<p>I once stood on the clock tower of the Customs House by the Huangpu River, embracing hazy reveries, and looked down at the lemon-colored waves of the Shanghai River, like a ribbon, scorching in the setting sun of late autumn, already dyed with a bright and beautiful light red, like rouge flowing into mercury, with a hazy sleepy look. Gradually, river smoke rose, weaving into a misty net, swallowing all the ships, big and small, into the belly of the night.</p>
<p>However, before long, the lights near the water twinkled like scattered stars. Even the factories across the river hung rows of amber-yellow distant lights, just like bright and seductive pearl diamonds on a black velvet shawl. Then, the ripples in the heart of the river were reflected in the electric light like pupils, and it was as if one could see the silver scales of a jade dragon playing in blue glass.</p>
<p>Although the whistles of steamships awakened the poetic realm of the water country, the white waves that surged angrily from its tail after the huge iron beast crawled past were like the soaring dragon claws, and like the posture of thousands of white geese turning over. Following that, there was an extension of the long howl of an angry and gradually lowering tiger, the sorrowful cry of a gibbon, realizing that one had entered a forest of deep pines, and a gust of crazy wind before a thunderstorm suddenly swept through.</p>
<p>After the tide subsided, the tranquil surface of the river was restored. The moon was already high in the blue and clear mid-sky. Moonlight spread flatly over the river, and the electric lights lost their sparkle, and a different realm appeared before one's eyes. The blue sky was reflected in the bottom of the water, and the bright moon also illuminated the clear shadows above and below, two heavens and two moons, separated by a trace of water, graceful and light; in the distance and nearby, sampans floated, and young girls or old women, rowing with double oars, ferried passengers across the river on moonlit nights, singing the folk songs of their hometown.</p>
<p>When the bells on the warships rang in unison, the great bell of the Customs House also emitted the sound of evening prayers in a church, breaking my dream in this bewitching musical smile with a sense of bewilderment and pleasure.</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Gender Equality</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>In this 20th century, as European customs gradually permeate the East, the voices for gender equality are growing louder day by day. No matter how much the moralists furrow their brows and sigh at fate, it doesn't matter. What men can do, women must also participate in, and where men can go, how can women lag behind? This trend of gender equality has already begun, and it cannot be reversed by a few moralists furrowing their brows and sighing at fate.</p>
<p>Although, you see, the world's countless men and women, physiologically speaking, since ancient times, the responsibility of giving birth and raising children has been assigned by God to women.</p>
<p>As for men, in this 20th century, no matter how advanced science is, they cannot share even a little of the responsibility of giving birth and raising children with women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this hot summer, if men go out wearing Chinese clothing, they must add a long gown to their bodies. If they wear Western clothing, it's even more of a torture! Wearing thick flannel, and whether in Chinese or Western clothing, they must wear a straw hat. Because, if they don't dress like this, they feel unfashionable and will be looked down upon. But what about women? They are much simpler and cooler. When they go out, they only need to wear a single gauze garment that is as thin as a cicada's wing, baring their chests and arms. Moreover, they don't need to wear a hat on their heads, and they don't need to wear socks on their feet, fully displaying their rich curves, and everywhere they go, they are</p>
<p>welcomed! As for the cold winter, when they wear fur coats and stroll around the amusement park, go to the cinema, or eat in restaurants with men, when they take off their coats, the men must step forward to catch them. When they want to put on their coats, the men must put them on for them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when men are sitting comfortably in a tram or a public bus, the bus suddenly stops, and a fashionable woman gets on. She doesn't greet any of the men, but when the men see her, they can't help but stand up solemnly and respectfully offer her their seat. It is said that this is respecting women (?), a courtesy that civilized people should know. Otherwise, they will be regarded as "fools" or "bumpkins."</p>
<p>Alas! Facts like these, concerning the inability of men and women to be equal, are too numerous to count. _______ Gender Equality</p>
<h3>A Different Biography of Mr. Zhu</h3>
<p>— Ren Pei Chu</p>
<p>I, with my bad memory, have forgotten Mr. Zhu's name; forgotten his place of origin; forgotten the school he graduated from. In short, he was a university graduate, a bachelor, a very conceited person. When he first graduated from university, he was determined to find a promising position in society; and the monthly salary had to be above one hundred yuan. The day after he received his bachelor's degree, he began his job search.</p>
<p>Soon, unexpectedly, he found a clerk</p>
<p>position at a foreign firm. He was overjoyed. This day was the day the firm paid salaries. He estimated his own salary. It would be above one hundred and fifty yuan, because he knew that none of his colleagues' "academic qualifications" were as good as his. However, hope and reality were very different. The salary he received was only fifty yuan. This fifty yuan salary, in the eyes of ordinary people, was indeed a hard-to-come-by income. But in the eyes of the conceited and extraordinary Mr. Zhu, the bachelor, it seemed to tarnish his status as a bachelor. So he resolutely left the foreign firm.</p>
<p>After a long time, he found a position as a document clerk at a department store. After he entered, he asked an old employee to inquire about the manager's tone. As a result, the old employee enthusiastically reported to him: "Fantastic! The manager is giving you special treatment! Thirty extra 'fan' per month." But this unlucky Mr. Zhu, the bachelor, disdained to do it and flounced away.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu, the bachelor's fate was not good. After he lost his second position, he was unemployed for five full years. The family's finances also experienced a crisis due to some reason. He looked everywhere for someone to recommend him, and finally got a position as an elementary school teacher. This time, he didn't have such extravagant hopes as before. Although the salary was only about twenty yuan, he didn't have the courage to lose it again.</p>
<h3>Presented to Actress Zhou Meijuan</h3>
<p>— Chuan Zhang Chao</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Clapperboards, red teeth, midnight song. The mood is vast, entrusted to the waves. Exquisite heart and beautiful appearance. Every time I face the carpet, I ask what to do.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Trying to entice voices in the singing and dancing troupe. Ten zhang of red dust, known and famous. If you ask when I will meet this auspicious creature. A single boat on Hengtang discusses Qiongying.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai war broke out the previous year, I went to Wuxing to manage a theater for a friend. The father of the famous actress Zhou Meijuan, Yao Fang, was working backstage, so I ordered the girl to treat me as her father, and I recorded this.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Bowing His Head in Agreement to Marriage, Her Heart is Filled with Affectionate Concern; Rejoicing, He Pays Attention to His Soldiers</p>
<p>Risking their lives to be soldiers, they are paid only half a year's worth of wages, and they still run into debt of at least twenty or thirty yuan. Those gentlemen in the newspapers, when they pick up their pens, say that China's soldiers are numerous but useless, and that raising soldiers at home impoverishes the country. In fact, it's not the soldiers' fault. It's just that the common people are so poor that they have no way out, and they have no food to eat if they don't become soldiers. And the country won't become poor because of the coarse corn bread-eating soldiers; it should become poor because of the generals who live in Western-style buildings and ride in cars. When he thought of this, he thought, I am also an officer, and I am much more comfortable than the soldiers. I'm going to get married soon, and I'll have a son in the future, so I have to be a good person. After expressing his feelings, he had a benevolent heart. He quietly looked into the dining hall, where a soldier was holding a bowl of vegetable soup and a bowl of coarse corn bread, squatting on the ground to eat. (Note: There are no tables and chairs.) He was touched again in his heart. What kind of common people, except beggars, eat like this? At that time, he went upstairs, saw Wang Shili, and smiled at him: "Tomorrow I'll take out two yuan to buy dozens of catties of pickles for the brothers to eat. Remind me tomorrow in case I forget." Wang Shili agreed, thinking in his heart, when our company commander gets happy, even the brothers get pickles to eat. It really is that when one person has good fortune, they bring good fortune to the whole house. When Zhao Ziqiang saw Wang Shili's smile, he must have approved of his idea, and he said with a smile: "I've been thinking like this for a long time." "Soon I'll have to invite you to my wedding." Wang Shili then understood that the company commander had often talked about getting married recently; could it be that he really wanted to get married? He smiled and said: "You're going to get married? That's great." As he spoke, Company Commander Hu came. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: "Did you hear? I'm going to get a wife. The person is really not bad, twenty-one years old this year, and she's good at all kinds of rough and fine work. Her mind is much more flexible than mine." (135)</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Cen Xilin</h3>
<p>— Tie Mi Tuo</p>
<p>People often think of Mr. Xilin. When I was a child, I followed my father and was an official in Guangdong and Guangxi, and I once saw Mr. Xilin's appearance. His flags and carriages filled the city, and it seems like it was just yesterday. Those who have heard anecdotes about Mr. Xilin miss Mr. Xilin's demeanor even more. I record the following: In the Sino-French battle of Liangshan, a complete victory had already been won, but the Qing court, fearful of Ma Bian's _______, _______ made peace, and the officers and soldiers were mostly saddened and indignant. At that time, Tang Jingsong was in the army as a _______, and secretly _______ Lu Asong to occupy the north of Vietnam. Lu Asong</p>
<p>; Lu Rongting's original name. He appeared and disappeared among the forests, and the French _______ people. Since then, he had repeatedly achieved victories. The commander-in-chief Su Yuanchun's department had a commander named Ma Shengzhi, who had an old relationship with Asong, and he also provided assistance from time to time, and his power became stronger. The French brought in large armies to confront him, but they all met with defeat. Unable to do otherwise, they requested that we appease and appease him, and they even used huge sums of money to entice Yuanchun. Asong then belonged to Su's department and led a battalion. They also made an agreement that Asong could not be promoted or transferred. When Mr. Cen opened his government in Guangdong and Guangxi, Asong had already changed his name to the current one. Knowing that he could be entrusted with great responsibility, he first promoted him to Border Defense Commander and stationed him in Zuojiang. People were afraid because of the old agreement, but Mr. Cen laughed without answering. The French envoy, as expected, protested against the breach of the agreement, and their momentum was fierce. The Qing court asked about it, and Mr. Cen replied: "Our country's internal affairs in using people are not for foreigners to question? Moreover, the previous agreement was about Lu Asong, but the official being promoted now is Lu Rongting. It is almost as different as wind, horses, and cattle, so why ask?" He showed this to the French envoy, who was speechless, and many people admired the Duke's courage.</p>
<p>After the庚子 year, the Qing court feared foreign guests like tigers, and the frontier officials feared missionaries like tigers. Many ambitious people joined the church as a protective talisman. There was a Catholic missionary named Zhou Huai Ren, who was French, and he set up a church in Guangxi's 浔州 and was in charge of church affairs in one province. At that time, the Guangdong-Guangxi Society Uprising broke out, and Governor Wang Zhichun led troops stationed in Xun to suppress the rebellion. Many of the rebels were church members, and Zhichun arrested them. Huai Ren went to visit and beg for their release. Zhichun was afraid and granted his request. He flattered him with Zhang Yan, and even gave him a fourth-grade official uniform to show his excellence. He had to be greeted in and out through the middle gate. As a result, the people competed to join the church, and in less than ten days, the number exceeded ten thousand. Mr. Cen impeached him and removed him. The Governor-General went west, also stationed in Xun City. Huai Ren still wore our clothing and hats to seek an audience. Mr. Cen knew the situation well and wanted to inflict a painful setback on him. He wore a yellow riding jacket and sat on the court. The summons was given, and Huai Ren was greatly surprised. Unable to do otherwise, he bowed forward. Mr. Cen asked who he was. Huai Ren answered. Mr. Cen said: "Why don't you kneel down?" He said: "I am a foreign missionary." Mr. Cen said: "Missionaries should be given courtesy, but you are wearing Chinese clothing and hats, so you should follow Chinese etiquette. My position is the first rank, and yours is the fourth rank, so you are a subordinate official. According to the court system, subordinate officials must kneel down when they see the governor wearing a yellow riding jacket. Now we are in the army, and we can act as we see fit. Have you not heard that I have received permission to execute those below the third rank before reporting?" After he finished speaking, his face was as hard as iron. Huai Ren knelt for a long time in trembling, and Mr. Cen counted his crimes and said: "Preaching should follow the regulations of the church and must not interfere with foreign affairs. I have heard that Wang Fu often protected bandits at that time. If you continue to do so, you will not be able to keep your head." Zhou repeatedly agreed, sweating profusely. He left the camp gate and immediately took off his clothes and hats and threw them on the ground, scolding Wang Zhichun for trapping people. Everyone was pleased.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Cen Yunjie</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhu Zun</p>
<p>The Divine Land suddenly mourns the fall of a great star. Counting on my fingers, it hasn't been a decade since we met. (A week before his death, Zhu visited the Duke, talking about the current situation, and inquired in detail about his young son's one hundred affairs in the Americas,) Since ancient times, he moved the loyal and righteous hearts of the king.</p>
<p>From now on, who else will punish the thieves? Heartbroken Cuckoo's thousands of hatreds. The old country's clouds and mountains are new for ten thousand eons. Recalling his life, he bore the burden of poetry. (The Duke often invited Zhu to drink, praising Zhu's capacity for liquor. He drank Zhu with the Duke's large bucket of liquor when he was strong. The bucket could hold three pounds. Zhu drank three buckets in one go, and the Duke gave it to him as a gift, and said, "Please write a poem to praise it." Zhu said yes, but the poem had not been completed for a long time, and when they met in the past, the Duke still asked about it,) Laying down sacrifices to the Duke, how can I stop the tear-stained towel? (Returning the favor)</p>

<h3>New Outlets for the National Products Industry</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The national products industry, in today's China, is like the sun and moon in the sky and rivers on the earth. Everyone knows to promote it, and everyone can use it. It has reached the point of being extremely popular. During this trip to the north, what I saw and heard, such as the Jiaoji Railway, Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, all have new positions for the development of the national products industry. The future of North China is extremely promising. I sincerely hope that the southern national products industry will broaden its horizons, use its courage, and travel north together to open up a new path for the national products industry. Recently, the national products exhibitions in Qingdao and Weihaiwei are not just about the liveliness during the exhibition period. In my opinion, in the future, the national products industry should pay attention to the following points during the exhibition period:</p>
<p>(1) Investigation Work: The number of wholesalers or retailers in the local area, the amount of business per store, where the goods are imported from, where they are sold, the total number of the city, the most popular products currently, the local people's purchasing power, the opinions on the price and pattern of the products, and how the foreign goods are dumped in the local area, should all be thoroughly investigated over time to provide a reference for development.</p>
<p>I say that if the exhibition fee in one place is assumed to be one thousand yuan, then the investigation fee should account for at least one-half, which is the most important work and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>(2) Joint Business Operations: If one factory sets up a business organization in one place, it will not only be costly and uneconomical, but customers will also find it difficult to contact and troublesome. If there is a national products company or a national organization in the local area, a manager can be publicly elected, and business personnel and cadres who are familiar with various industries can be sent to carry out the work, which is economical and will have great benefits in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Contacting Businesses: When exhibiting in a place, do not arbitrarily lower prices and damage the feelings of local businesses. You should contact them in advance, negotiate everything with them, and contact them in many ways to build relationships with them. Either sell them goods or sign contracts so that each business is not only not harmed, but also benefits more. Then each business will be happy to promote and trade. It must be known that the exhibition period is short, and the days of contact are long. This is the most important issue and the key to opening up new outlets.</p>

<h3>A Few Minor Problems</h3>
<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>I hope that national products manufacturers will not be infected I</p>
<p>In China, a semi-colonial country, the military aggression of the great powers is tangible; economic aggression is intangible; tangible is easy to defend against, intangible is difficult to defend against; because intangible economic aggression is a trick of "killing people without seeing blood."</p>
<p>In order to prevent the trick of "killing people without seeing blood," which is becoming more stubborn and harmful, there is a national products movement, which is indeed a miraculous medicine to avoid economic aggression.</p>
<p>However, Chinese people generally have several minor problems. If national products manufacturers are infected with them, they will hinder the progress of national products and be able to ruin the entire China. Now I am writing them down specifically for my beloved national products manufacturers:</p>
<p>(1) Starting Strong but Finishing Weak: Most Chinese people start strong but finish weak. They start out well, but gradually regress. If the national products industry is infected with this problem, when the products are produced, the quality will be excellent, and the decoration will be beautiful. However, when sales are strong, they will gradually degrade, causing customers to distrust them. This is a minor matter that directly affects the business itself, but it is a major matter that indirectly hinders the progress of national products. I hope that the national products industry will pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>(2) Passing off Fish Eyes as Pearls: The opposite of "true" is "false." When there is "true," there will inevitably be "false." Chinese people are accustomed to using "false" to pass off as "true," as long as they can deceive. The national products industry must not be infected with this problem, especially not taking inferior goods, replacing and pasting national products trademarks, to deceive the Chinese people. In particular, they must not use inferior raw materials to manufacture national products, indirectly exporting money to help the enemy.</p>
<p>(3) Arrogance in Victory: Everything has failure and success. Success is of course a happy thing. However, the more successful you are, the more you should strive to improve so that your products reach the point of perfection. You must not be complacent because of temporary success. You must know that "arrogance leads to failure." This is an unchanging principle of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>(4) Discouragement in Failure: Success is indeed a happy thing, but failure is also common. "Failure is the mother of success." Without failure, how can there be success? Failure is enough to promote my efforts. You must not be discouraged by temporary failure and stop moving forward.</p>
<p>(5) Envy and Jealousy Among Peers: Everyone has jealousy. Those who fail are accustomed to envying those who succeed. You must know that for national products comrades, other people's success is indirectly my success, because everyone is working hard for national products, so we must "treat each other with sincerity" and "work together with one heart" to unite a solid national products front to resist our enemies.</p>
<p>The above five points are what I thought of and talked about. I hope that the comrades in the national products industry will strive to "correct them if they have them, and add to them if they don't."</p>

<h3>Qingdao Stone Company</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Qingdao's national products industry has yarn mills, flour mills, and cotton weaving mills, but the Stone Company is the newest industry. The reporter recently visited the Qingdao China Stone Company with the introduction of Mr. Li Zumo, led by directors Fang Lianbi and Yao Zuobin. The factory buildings are specially built, and the manufacturing is all done by machines. There are dozens of kinds of products, with building materials, furniture, and souvenirs being the most common. All kinds of stone are delicate and dense and are not as good as imported products. Established for several months, the turnover has already reached hundreds of thousands, and the welcome from customers can be imagined. According to Mr. Yao, the decorative stones used on the exterior of the bottom floor of the Shanghai Four Banks Savings Society's twenty-two-story building are made by the company. Recently, people from all over the country have come to place orders, and there is a constant stream of them. The capital of 200,000 yuan is a limited liability company, and the manager is Mr. Yao Wenwei. Mr. Yao said that the reason why all the company's products can sell well in various places is that, first, the stones used in construction are often too heavy, which is not very suitable for construction. The company's stones are cut into thin slices, which greatly reduces the weight and is extremely convenient. Second, foreign goods have excessive tariffs and are more than twice as expensive as the company's products, and the quality is not as good. When Mr. Yao spoke, he showed various kinds of European and American stone, and used sulfuric acid for testing. When dipped in Italian stone, it foamed, while when dipped in Chinese stone, it did not change at all. It can be seen that the company's products are sufficient to withstand wind and rain erosion and never change color.</p>
<h3>Double Sword Brand Disinfectant Water Giving Away Fans</h3>
<p>The Double Sword Brand Disinfectant Water, which is wholly distributed by Xinyuan Firm, Sanyangjing Bridge, in this port, has excellent quality and remarkable efficacy. It is an essential health product for the summer. Since its launch, its reputation has spread at home and abroad. The weather has been hot recently, and sales have increased dramatically. In order to give customers a special treat, the firm is giving away art fans. All those who purchase one gallon of Double Sword Brand Disinfectant Water at the firm's store will receive two fans, and those who purchase half a gallon or 0.25 gallons will each receive one fan. Because there are many buyers, they will soon be given away. All resale stores are also giving them away.</p>

<h3>"Western Servant Philosophy"</h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. K, resides in a small room in a lane inhabited by White Russians. The "western servant" (i.e., the direct translation of "servant" in European languages) of that household is an extraordinary proponent of national essence. For example, although he can speak English, he tells Mr. K, "I still follow the old customs of the countryside, eating only two meals a day." Eating two meals a day is not unusual, but the fact that he bases it on "old customs" - this attitude of not forgetting the national essence in one's conduct is something that should be greatly encouraged in today's world.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the great floods and disturbances in the countryside, this western servant's wife, with her bound feet, brought a six- or seven-year-old boy to Shanghai. Although Shanghai's prosperity overwhelmed the child, a child is, after all, a child, and soon he was mixing with the neighborhood children. However, the green-eyed, yellow-haired playmates, while very happy during playtime, would immediately unleash the pride of being "superior" and "upper-class" that their parents had taught them whenever they had the chance, making this little boy with a queue, torn trousers, and a face as dark as a South Seas native suffer a harsh "punishment." In such situations, our western servant found himself in a dilemma; he could not help but respect his esteemed neighbors, but he also loved his little son...</p>
<p>But he ultimately had his own way... He forbade the child from going out. If he discovered that the child had slipped out while he wasn't paying attention, he would immediately drag him back, scolding, "Go! Go! See if they don't beat you to death!" Thus, he confined the child to the small courtyard. Sometimes, when those foreign children rushed into the small courtyard to play, he would drag him into the house. But what if those foreign children rushed into the house one day? I believe he would have his own ways to deal with it.</p>
<p>Regarding this western servant's actions, my friend, Mr. K, coined a term for it, calling it... the philosophy of non-resistance.</p>
<p>But some others say that non-resistance has "existed in China since ancient times" and can certainly be listed as a first-class national essence. However, the non-resistance of Chinese national essence is not unchanging for thousands of years; it has now reached an era of "great accomplishment." Following the non-resistance model of 1933, it is not enough for this western servant to merely drag the child back and confine him. He should cover the child's ears to prevent him from "hearing anything improper," cover his eyes to prevent him from "seeing anything improper," and, most importantly, gag his mouth...</p>
<p>If he still slips out after all that, then he is clearly a troublemaker. Such a son is "worse than none at all" and should be punished with the "crime of filial impiety" (translated into vernacular, it's the "crime of disobeying parental orders"), locked in a dark room, beaten with thorny sticks, buried alive, flayed alive...</p>
<h3>Thoughts Inspired by Nude Sports</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>I remember when I first came to Shanghai two or three years ago, many friends from Jiangnan would always ask when they met, "I heard that Wuhan often holds nude parades. Is that true? Are they nice to look at?" The reason so many friends were so interested in asking this, I think, was firstly because they felt that nude parades were very "nice to look at," that being able to see groups of men and women parading around naked was a feast for the eyes, and perhaps they even thought that I was one of those in the nude group; and secondly, because they felt that the Wuhan government dared to hold nude parades, daring to dismantle all the defenses of ritual and moral teachings, that they were truly a group of mad beasts, and their downfall was only right. Unfortunately, as far as I know, the Wuhan government never held a single nude parade, and I never had the pleasure of feasting my eyes on such a spectacle. I sincerely explained to them that it was not true, that it was a baseless rumor, but they remained skeptical. From Shanghai to Wuhan, there are only two or three days' journey, and the transportation is still convenient, but at that time, the general public's understanding of the situation in Wuhan was so distant, as if they were on different planets, that even a rumor that had no reason to be believed would be deeply believed. Everyone regarded Wuhan as a land of beasts, "turning pale at the mention of the tiger," and so the Wuhan government finally fell (naturally, the Wuhan government itself was a great contradiction, a great furnace, with no reason to be stable). From this, we can imagine the great power of rumors, and we cannot but admire the unparalleled intelligence of the rumor-mongers.</p>
<p>It has been five or six years since the Wuhan government collapsed, and everyone seems to have long forgotten that terrible "land of beasts." Currently, the revivalist movement is being vigorously promoted. Beijing has banned women from carrying male dogs, and has banned calling young ladies "Miss," creating something of a "cultural revival." However, in Shanghai, the general run of young ladies and mistresses, when summer arrives, must wear gossamer-thin gauze, completely exposing their legs, making their skin like snow, like Mount Lu in the mist, faintly visible, in order to be considered first-class "modern." Recently, the wind of nude sports has even spread from Hong Kong. As times change, perhaps the nude parade that never existed in the era of the Wuhan government will be seen in Shanghai today. Fortunately, in these enlightened times, even if a nude parade really takes place, no one would consider it a big deal that warrants collapse.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not opposed to nude sports. I believe that the relationship between men and women is originally nothing special, and stripping off clothes to make the human body as fully exposed as nature is especially not something to be surprised at. "If the sages did not die, great robbers would never cease." Precisely because the general public sees the relationship between the sexes as mysterious, and even sees certain parts of the human body as mysterious, the moralistic gentlemen put on a stern face and teach people "Do not move unless it is proper, do not look unless it is proper." Thus, in the literary world, there are writers who specialize in depicting sexual love to cater to the psychology of young people, in the corners of the streets there are small vendors who specialize in selling certain pictures, and clever directors often use women's thighs and seductive dances to attract audiences. If everyone can make the mysterious commonplace, then "If you are not surprised by the strange, the strangeness will defeat itself," and there will certainly be fewer rights and wrongs, and fewer evils, between the sexes.</p>
<p>What I feel is that it has been five or six years since the era of the Wuhan government, but the wisdom of the general public in spreading rumors has not increased at all. Even today, there are still people shouting, "Shared wives and husbands are a flood and a beast!" Alas, how few are those who hear this and do not cover their ears and walk away!</p>
<h3>To Mr. Zhao Jingshen</h3>
<p>— Yu Mutao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao... Today, after reading your article published in "Free Talk," I feel that you, who claim to be a "good-natured person," are deliberately being muddle-headed. Firstly, I think your cuteness is somewhat like Xishi imitating Dongshi. For example, you came to settle my old accounts from "Popular Literature" several years ago, even changing my content and title to "Creation," I don't know if it was for "smoothness" and "harmony." Whoever read that issue of "Popular Literature" would know that my article was originally an introduction to several emerging American writers. After introducing Sinclair and Gold, and four others, I said that due to space constraints, I would introduce other writers when I had the opportunity. You say that I dismissed the writers of the "New Masses" with one stroke. I ask you, are you deliberately fabricating this, or else, as an expert on Andersen and "monopolizing" the world of literature, you would not know that Gold is an outstanding figure in the "New Masses." I am indeed not clever, but I have learned from your brilliance. For example, when you were discussing translation last year, the "extraordinary" of "Milk Road," which was criticized by Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Mao Dun, should not be equal to the east wind passing by the horse's ear.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have not yet had the pleasure of reading your masterpiece published in "Micro-tone Monthly." Otherwise, I would have had a counter-criticism long ago.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the comparison table you published is too boring. Your eyes only see others and do not see yourself. Because you acted first, you took the works of your predecessors as your private property. Here, I cannot help but ask you, are you a divinely appointed literary historian? Why, after you have read the books of the original authors, am I not allowed to read them? Why, after you have quoted the materials of your predecessors, am I not allowed to quote them! You can just as well take the "extraordinary" book and list a comparison table with the complete works of various writers from the Han and Wei dynasties onwards, poetry anthologies, and the works of modern people. Everyone is based on their predecessors in this respect, so it seems unnecessary to fabricate so much. My compilation, "A General History of World Literature," contains 300,000 words in three volumes. The one or two thousand words on Chinese literature account for less than one-fifteenth. Stepping back, even if I used your "extraordinary" book, it is not a bad thing, because culture is the sum of all intelligence. If you have strengths in this area, it is not a bad thing for me to use them to make up for other shortcomings. Otherwise, you should not publish books; you should hide your opinions and use them as secret formulas for wandering fortune-tellers. However, even on this one point, I still have many supplements. As for the social explanations I have given on this point, such as why the "ci fu" arose in the Han dynasty, why the writers of the Wei and Jin dynasties were passive, why Tang poetry developed in particular, why the "ci" existed in the Five Dynasties and the Song dynasty, why Yuan opera occurred, and why the chapter novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties appeared, I think you, an expert on Andersen, would really have no way to copy them. This is what I focus on in this book.</p>
<p>Fourthly, my compilation, "A General History of World Literature," is ultimately completely different from the "History of Chinese Literature" by the Andersen expert. Otherwise, I would not need to organize it. I hope that those who criticize my compilation in terms of methodology will start with methodology, because "everything is determined by content." This is my principle. If anyone else ignores methodology and only makes tedious efforts on form in the future, I will consider it deliberate misunderstanding and will not reply for the sake of saving time!</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>It seems that the only reason for the existence of female cousins is because there are male cousins. The same is true of Shuqun and Sibin. Sibin's home and Shuqun's home are not far apart, so they have more opportunities to get close. As they got closer to a certain extent, a change occurred in Shuqun's belly, so they had to embark on the road that many male and female cousins had already taken.</p>
<p>From that marriage, Sibin could say that he didn't get anything new. On the contrary, he lost the subtle, intimate pleasures from then on. And at the same time, he also felt some unhappiness, because he felt that this was just an obligation to him, an unavoidable obligation, due to the change in Shuqun's belly. Yes, he was somewhat infatuated with the change in her belly. He often caressed the gradually rising belly, and sometimes he stared at it, watching the seemingly rhythmic movements inside.</p>
<p>But only in the moment after the child was born was he excited. He felt that somehow his interest was declining day by day. He didn't want to do anything. When he really felt that time was not easy to pass, he casually pulled out a collection of poetry from the bookshelf and read it. Sometimes when he saw something he liked, he translated it; but after translating it, he did not keep it. When his emptiness could not be filled by reading or translating poetry, he would also think of visiting his friends.</p>
<p>Going out to see friends was not his habit, so his friends could not help but show a slightly surprised look when they saw him go, so he immediately felt constrained. As soon as he felt constrained, he couldn't sit still, so he hastily came up with the reason why he went to see him, talked briefly, and left. But after going several times, this constraint disappeared invisibly, so he could sit for a long time. And even if he occasionally felt that his host might be annoyed by his long stay, he would comfort himself by saying that going to see people was originally for himself, and that as long as the other party did not show any slight indication of annoyance, he could sit as long as he wanted when he wanted to sit, and there was no need to find assumptions to trouble himself. But although he discovered that comfort, he could not sit down himself, especially when people complimented his wife.</p>
<p>Yes, sitting in the same way, why couldn't he answer? Because there was indeed nothing to find pleasure in at a friend's house... Perhaps there was only one answer, which was because he was not at home. He then deeply investigated why he didn't like to stay in his own home. The result of that investigation was that it surprised even himself, because Shuqun's temperament was too good.</p>
<p>Yes, he hated her kind of meticulous thoughtfulness. He would rather she shouted, made a fuss, cried, and laughed; he wanted to go out, she would grab him; he wanted to translate poetry, she would tear up his manuscript paper... just to completely possess him. She didn't want to obey his words so much, or even anticipate everything she thought he needed. Thinking of this, he felt a sense of revulsion in his heart and refused to endure it any longer. He was enduring, he thought, even though she undoubtedly meant well in doing so. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Creative Novel</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things (17)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>They both stopped mechanically, and at the same time saw three armed soldiers walking out of a lane entrance... one in front, holding a Browning automatic pistol, with hand grenades hanging on his chest; two in the back, with bayonets fixed to their rifles. After they took out their passports and verified them, the soldier holding the pistol carefully questioned them. However, the questioning was like a enthusiastic primary school teacher carefully examining a wronged new student...</p>
<p>They finally parted ways with this first sentry's post. After walking north for more than a hundred steps, they turned east; after walking for a while, they turned a few more bends. Then, they gradually saw the devastation and slaughter that the enemy had carried out in half a month.</p>
<p>At first, Zhiguang saw far away on the left a three-story, five-room red brick building that looked like it was under construction. The walls on several sides seemed to have been completed to nine-tenths, but the internal wood seemed to be completely uninstalled. So he actually wondered why someone would use this old style in this new era, and then he wondered why the interior decoration had not started, and the wooden scaffolding outside had been completely removed. Finally, he got closer and understood... Not only should everything inside the wall have been complete, everything should have been complete for a long time, and there should have been all kinds of furnishings, all kinds of life. Probably one day in the past half month, this tall building was hit by an enemy sulfur bomb, so everything inside it collapsed and was destroyed along with the roof above it, leaving only these four walls in the air, these four walls in the air that still had scorch marks!</p>
<p>This really made Zhiguang have to go to the front to see clearly! However, his footsteps had not moved for long when he found a large pit in the middle of the street that had been dug by an enemy bomb. The soil at the edge of the pit was a foot or two higher than the ground. He also saw not far away that more than a dozen city houses had also been bombed, or rather, burned, leaving only empty shells. However, the empty shells still preserved the outline of the old buildings. Gradually, Zhiguang had a new discovery... The walls only had piles of broken tiles, and not even a bit of charcoal could be seen from the wood. Occasionally, from half a boundary marker standing on the side of the road or a section of stone wall foundation left on the side of the road, people could associate the fact that there must have been a house in that place! Visiting a construction project in this kind of place is like a doctor stopping at a slaughterhouse with a dismembered and eviscerated corpse. Moreover, this slaughterhouse is still continuing to expand day by day!</p>
<p>A soldier guarding the post said to him, "Compatriot, this place used to be a very large lane. When we first started fighting, we used it as a position for cannons. Who knew that five or six days ago, the little devils used four planes to burn and bomb it into this state!"</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Rises Five Yuan Three in Half-Day</h3>
<p>Silver Price Increase Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Market Transactions Mostly Short Covering</p>
<p>The gold market turned stable again yesterday, with a very firm situation. The mid-way rebound was very rapid. Although the prices of British and American silver rose in the morning, compared with the previous market decline, it seemed not much. British exchange to American exchange rose by five and seventy-five points, while American exchange to British exchange rose by five points. The far-term silver price on the Five Metals Exchange varied from 1200 to 5 per mille. Private telegrams also increased by 3.125. American cotton increased by 8 pounds per point. American wheat contracted by more than one point. Stocks had little increase or contraction. People's minds were stable. Bingxing entered the market to cover shorts. The overall market situation had a latent upward trend. After the opening, it continued to be firm, but because HSBC raised the exchange rate by 0.25 shillings and the American exchange rate by 0.75, there was a setback. However, short covering was excited. The bank still had a good appetite. As the domestic market tightened, the gold market rose sharply. Later, it was heard that the listed exchange rate had shrunk, the American exchange rate was half a yuan, and it was pushed to over 70 yuan. In reality, only the shilling rate was reduced by 0.25, and the American exchange rate was reduced by 0.375. People were psychologically disappointed, and Western brokers sold off, causing a sharp reversal. In the end, because demand exceeded supply, it was able to maintain. The noon close was higher than the previous time, and major players in the market, such as Bingxing and Dadecheng, entered to cover shorts. Those who were arbitraging exchange rates, such as the Dalian gang, also entered. The boiled red price was increased by 250 yuan as usual. The situation of the half-day market today will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 759.5 yuan, a slight increase of 0.5 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 60 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Fuchang, Dadecheng, and Shenkang all entered. Central Stock Company and Jewish merchants bid 32 yuan for September, 1.875 for October, and rose to 64 yuan. Bingxing sold strips and retreated. Hengxing sold strongly and fell to 58.8 yuan. Sumitomo came out with the American dollar at 1.25 in October, and Huabi ate 1.875 in the same month and pulled it to over 60 yuan. I learned that HSBC raised the British exchange rate by 0.25 and the American exchange rate by 0.75. Yuanfeng, Yongheng, Yufu, Qianchangxiang, and others sold and retreated to 57.5 yuan. Bingxing, Yuanheng, and the Dalian gang entered from time to time. Huabi ate the American dollar at 3.75 in November, and 1.875 in October, and pulled it to over 60 yuan. It was not long before the American dollar at 1.25 in October was difficult to close. Hengyu and Dadecheng entered again to 63.5 yuan. Goods sold strips and fell by 1.5 yuan. Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, and others were still able to buy, and remained stable. Pangen came to eat the American dollar at 1.25 in November. Hengxing entered the market and bought vigorously, reaching 5.5 yuan. Wanxing came to sell and retreated to 3 yuan. However, because Pangen continued to pay 1.25 in November, Qianchangxiang, Richang, Hengyu, Hengtai, Qingfa, and Yongtai repeatedly entered strips, and people's minds were greatly encouraged. Sassoon ate 32 yuan in November, and when it rose to 8 yuan, coupled with rumors that HSBC's American exchange listing had shrunk by half a yuan, Richang, Fuchang, and retail investors rushed in and pushed it to 70 yuan and 0.2 yuan. HSBC and Huabi ate the American dollar at 8.125 in October. Hengyu and Shunmao sold at high prices and gradually retreated. HSBC's listing only reduced the British exchange rate by 0.25 and the American exchange rate by 0.375. It seemed too little. Western brokers sold strips, and Tongxing, Yongzhifeng, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, Yuanheng, the Dalian gang, Dadecheng, Yuansheng, and Yongfen sold. The American dollar at 8.75 in October was difficult to sell, and it fell to 62.5 yuan. Shunli and Hengxing entered to cover shorts at low prices and rose to over 5 yuan. The noon close was 764.3 yuan, and goods were raised by 5.5 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 770.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 757.5 yuan, with an increase or decrease of 12.7 yuan. The result was a rebound of 5.3 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price, after being offset by the HSBC Bank's American exchange listing, was still 0.375 higher, at 30.875 yuan, corresponding to a standard gold price of 777 yuan and change. In terms of the closing price, it was about 13 yuan. If calculated based on the initial listing price of 31.25 yuan, the corresponding gold price was 768 yuan. At the time of the announcement, it was only 8 or 9 yuan, and recently only 7 yuan, less than 15 yuan less than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 776 yuan, 769 yuan for August, and 764 yuan for September. The morning replenishment was 776 yuan, and the boiled red price was increased by 250 yuan as usual. Formal transactions should be increased by 260 to 70 yuan. Jinfu and the guest gang had slight entries and exits, and the situation was confusing. The gold price in Hong Kong was also 0.3 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Short covering transactions in the market were still surging, and currency arbitrage also had buying. In summary, Hengxing, Daxing, Yongyi, Fengyong, Yuanfeng, Yongtong, Tongxing, Yongshunmao, Yuanmao, Yongzhifeng, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, Fuchang, and others were on the selling side. The Dalian gang and Shenkang, Richang, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Hengtai, Qingfa, Yongbingxing, Dadecheng, and others entered. Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Yuankangxiang, and others entered first and then exited. The Dalian gang, Shunzeman, and Wanxing each entered more than 1,300 and exited more than 1,000, netting about 300 strips. Guanggang Hengxing entered more than 500 and exited more than 700, netting about 200 strips. There are still 2,569 strips left for this month, 2,611 for August, and 20,293 for September.</p>
<h3>Bank Absorption Improves, British and American Exchange Rates Tighten Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>丨HSBC Listing Initially Increases and Then Shrinks丨</p>
<p>According to foreign news from London yesterday, both near-term and far-term rose by 0.0625. American silver rose by half a point, the British exchange rate to the American exchange rate rose by five and seventy-five points, and the American exchange rate to the British exchange rate rose by five points. The far-term silver price rose by two to five per mille. Private telegrams then increased by 3.125. At the morning opening, the near-term selling price was calculated as 1 shilling 3.75 pence for the British exchange rate, and 31.8125 yuan for the American exchange rate, which was calculated as British parity and American firmness of 0.125 compared to the previous close. After the opening, the bank's appetite was still good, and stock companies and Jewish merchants all had buying, and the situation was better. However, HSBC Bank's listing rose by 0.25 and the American rate rose by 0.75, and once it eased back, but the people's minds were stable, the gold market was short-covering, and the banks vigorously pulled it up, and it tightened again. HSBC's second listing changed and contracted 0.25 for the British exchange rate, and the American contracted a small 0.375, and then it tightened. The noon close had a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 3.5625 pence for the British exchange rate, and 31.4375 yuan for the American exchange rate, compared with the previous one of 0.1875, and the American tightened 25. Banks both absorbed and sold, and there were many sales after offsetting. The gold industry was the opposite, selling about 100,000 American exchanges. Silver companies, Central Stock Company, and Jewish merchants also absorbed. The half-day trading record will be recorded today.</p>

The early market was 843 yuan, and the afternoon market was 844 yuan. Although the result was a drop of four or five yuan compared with the afternoon market the day before yesterday, the market sentiment has generally been on a flat course. 6,000 jiao were traded in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market price of small foreign silver in Guangdong was 774.5 yuan, and the afternoon market price was also 774.5 yuan.

<h3>The Golden Age of Bonds in the Securities Market</h3>
<p>Capitalists Absorb Greatly</p>
<p>The Number of Chips on the Market is Dwindling</p>
<p>All Bonds Have Found New High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange did not show any signs of decline. At a time when market prices are advancing day by day and new highs are being discovered day by day, the eating households are still not satisfied. Market prices have been separated from military politics and are completely based on the loose silver supply and capitalists' widespread absorption, which makes the activity of chips on the market feel more and more depleted. Generally, those who have spot goods are not unwilling to sell them, but are afraid that once they are sold, they will no longer have the opportunity to buy them back. Therefore, the source is becoming more and more scarce. When the market opened yesterday morning, a certain savings association had another need, and the market price rose again by several cents. Almost all bonds have found new highs again. Only the 96 public bonds still feel tired and unable to rise. The public debt market in the past year can be called the golden age at this time. There was a slight sign of fatigue in the second round, and retail investors sold slightly, a small amount of two or three cents, while the forward salt tax rose by one cent, and the long-term financial bonds rose by two cents. The market price results showed that the rise and fall were mixed by about three cents, with more rises than falls. Most of them were near high and far low. Most of the transactions were swaps. The total number of transactions was 11,026,000 yuan, of which spot goods were only 1,000 yuan. The total futures salt tax was 3,810,000 yuan, the troop reduction accounted for 1,440,000 yuan, the 19 customs duties accounted for 1,240,000 yuan, the 22 volumes of 20 customs duties accounted for 2,010,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 350,000 yuan. The 96 bonds had slightly more than 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Remain Stable</h3>
<p>New Feng Yang Bank reported that on Tuesday (the 18th), the New York stock market was first turbulent due to the closing of long positions, and prices were quite uneven. Later, it was heard that the government would implement gold liberalization to allow gold to circulate freely in the market. Also, because the US dollar fell, the gold mining stocks rose sharply, and all stocks also turned firm. US Steel once exceeded 67 yuan, the first time since 1931. The total volume of transactions for the day was 6,659,000 shares. The stock market trend may temporarily still hover, but will continue to advance. Wheat was firm at first due to mass buying, but fell back due to long positions selling. The spot position is very weak. US cotton rose slightly compared to yesterday, but the current market is high, and there are too many long positions, so the trend is difficult to predict. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flowers - The Standard Yarn's Recovery is Not Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly flat. Because US cotton continued to rise, people's hearts are somewhat stable, but the seller's pressure is still strong, and selling continues. With sufficient delivery in July, and a certain manufacturer is also bearish, the speculation business's idea of short selling is becoming stronger. The actual demand is still stagnant. However, a portion of it is not released because its base is weak. Therefore, the market price fluctuates.</p>
<p>(The standard yarn is near weak and far strong) The opening of the standard yarn's previous market was still weak, and there were quite a few sellers. Each month fell by three or four cents. The second and third rounds gradually rebounded. As a result, each month rose by one, three, four, and five cents, but this month fell by one cent. The transaction statistics were 26,600 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 2,200 bales, Gengfeng 1,200 bales, Renfeng 1,450 bales, and Changfeng 1,250 bales.

<h3>The Reason for the Rebound in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>US Cotton Continues to Rise...Short Sellers' Delivery is Insufficient</p>
<p>People's Hearts are Agitated...Retail Investors Compensate One After Another</p>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply due to the rise in foreign cotton, and the short positions for this month's delivery were insufficient. Buyers prepared to receive the goods and compensate the manufacturers. As a result, people's hearts were agitated, and retail investors compensated. The market situation suddenly turned tight. However, there were many who shorted new cotton in the far month, because the borrowed US cotton could be used to offset the application at that time. Therefore, they are bearish on new cotton. However, the overseas cotton market is still trending upward.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard is Relatively Firm in the Near Term) The market opened in the Zheng Standard's previous market, and the market price suddenly rose. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the near term rose by five cents, and the far term rose by ten or three cents. The total number of counts in the market was 37,400 dan. It was found that Yuchang sold 4,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,200 dan, Yicheng 1,600 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,600 dan, and Yuda 1,200 dan.

<h3>Grain and Rice Under the River Sees a Rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, Yuan No. 20 and Changbang, Subang, Nangang, etc. of japonica rice and Du Yangjian, due to the small amount of incoming goods and the good sales in this street, the sellers tightened their grip, and the market saw an improvement. The market price increased by several cents to more than one corner. If Qingjiao, Song Si Feng Shu, Bo Dao, Jinbang goes to Si Song Feng Bo Dao five, counting five or six hundred packages, the rest is mostly zero stomach, the market price also rises horn, yuan is still flat and tired, Bian Yuan continued to see Tingxiu.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 boats came from various routes under the river. The market for white japonica rice moved slightly, and the market price increased by one corner. Early thin rice did not fluctuate much. Yang Du Jian arrived less, and sales were flat. The market for Du Jian was fixed, and Yang Jian was tired. The tip of the guest port was close to one corner, and the Bian Yuan was fixed.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice is Sold on This Street</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice at Five Cents | Guest Rice at Two Corners |</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign guest indica rice continued to be tired. It happened that the rice from under the river arrived less and the price was high, which attracted the attention of the countryside in this street to foreign guest indica rice. Xiaojiao Saigon each at five cents. The actual sales in this street were very active. Office No. 1 Saigon sold 800 packages at a price of 8 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 cents to 0.7 cents.

<h3>Flour Recovers After Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was quoted at foreign wheat prices, with Chicago at a small three or four cents and Canada at a good two or three cents. Therefore, the morale was very flat when it first opened in the morning. In addition, actual sales were still sluggish, and the sales of Shen flour were reduced. It was heard that the flour from Tianjin, originally from the Yangtze River and below Jinan, was rarely shipped. Now they have all started to ship. According to the Tianjin Gang, there are already 500,000 packages. Therefore, the thoughts of the guest gangs are relatively flat. This month, because the manufacturers have slightly replenished, they have recovered after being tired. The forward period is also slightly better, but the transaction is very quiet, and development is quite difficult. As a result, July and August were small two and a half cents, September and October were good two and a half cents, and November and December were good seven and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat is Sold at a Reduced Price by the Factory</h3>
<p>Futures are near small and far good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the daily wheat was quoted at the price of foreign wheat, and there were a few corners of ups and downs with each other, and the hearts of the people have paid little attention. As for the recent situation of the wheat market, it seems that it is difficult for the mainland and the outer ports to be consistent, because the mainland is still expensive, and this port is difficult to recover due to the sluggish sales of flour. This month, because the end-of-month delivery is approaching, it is heard that more than 40 cars have been inspected and qualified, and there are still more than 100 cars waiting for inspection. Therefore, people's hearts are very calm, and the far term is still good because the origin is quoted at a high price. As a result, this month is good for one point, August is good for one point, September is good for three points, October and November are good for four points, and December is good for one point. Spot wheat is sold at a reduced price by the factory, and high-quality goods are sold at three to five points lower, and the middle and second-class are as usual.

<h3>City Gate Soybeans Continue to Rise by Five Cents</h3>
<p>New soybeans are the most dominant when they are newly ripe and on the market, because their source is sporadic and insufficient for the Yongbang's sales, so the market situation is firm. Yesterday, 68 packages of Chengmendou continued to arrive, and the opening price rose by another five cents. Hankou beans saw samples slightly later and could not catch up with the market. About 200 to 300 packages of Fenqing, and more than 500 packages of June white.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Taikoo Sugar Reduced Again by Three Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had a small gold and a long Dutch exchange rate, and the trend of the target gold continued to fall, making the transaction bleak. The public association's division of disks 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods fell by another five cents, with only a small number of transactions at 19 yuan and 9 and a half corners. Dutch red KD marks 16 yuan, and the downward trend of Taikoo sugar is still strong, and it is also reduced by a small triangle, B mark is 20 yuan and a half, Chinese cotton white shouts the original price without receiving, but the factory is quite willing to loosen again, and there are no Zhenji goods. Chao Bang's shop only offered 22 packages of Bann Qing at a price of 13 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Exchange Rate Continues to Rise, Silk Sales Remain Quiet</h3>
<p>(The Body of Summer Cocoons in Jiangsu Province is Not Good) The quality of summer cocoons in Jiangsu Province is not very good. This year, the price of mulberry leaves is high and there is insufficient leaf feeding, so the cocoon production is even worse. The average baking discount must be pulled at least 300 catties, and the cocoon reeling discount must be about 700 catties.</p>
<p>(New Sichuan Silk Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai) The second and third batches of new Sichuan yellow silk are being shipped to Shanghai one after another. The Lianri Pinghe and other wheels have loaded a total of 108 boxes.</p>
<p>(The Price of Rayon is Trending Down) Recently, the foreign exchange rate has become more and more tense, and the price of rayon has continued to fall, and customer sales are still smooth. Yesterday, Shanghai Silk Factory sent 44 boxes of futures for July and August of Dawu Red Fish Head No. 2 Flying Elephant and other brands, and the price ranged from 178 yuan, 7 jiao and a half to 170 yuan net plate.</p>
<p>(Foreign Bank's Silk Sales Remain Stagnant) Yesterday, the silk market of foreign banks in this port became more and more lifeless. The reason is that the exchange rate continued to rise, and the overseas telegram turned the silk price even smaller. Chinese silk merchants all held the price reduction and did not sell, and the market was stagnant. Yesterday, only Indian banks replenished a few scattered yellow silks, totaling less than 10 packages, and the price trend was flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Locally Produced Zhenmei Tea Sales are Active in Europe</h3>
<p>Since the new goods of locally produced green tea in this port have been on the market, the sales have been very sparse, resulting in most of the more than 40 tea factories shutting down and stopping work. Yesterday, according to foreign bank news, the sales of locally produced Zhenmei tea in the Moroccan market have become active. Xiehe, Yihui, Huacha, Tongfu, and other major firms have all received telegrams ordering Zhenmei tea from that route. Huzhou Anding goods are the most popular in the market, with a market price of 85 to 6 yuan, which is not higher or lower than before. However, the situation of Luzhuang Zhenmei tea has not progressed. The market price of Gaozhuang's core-extracted goods has been reduced to within 200 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan from before. Ordinary Zhuang goods are extremely stagnant, and the market price is difficult to stand firm. The other Gongxi Zhucha and other items are also quiet.</p>
<p>Business Sutra Twenty-Three</p>
<h3>Coix is the Newest and Most Delicious Vegetable</h3>
<p>In summer, vegetables are the most suitable. Generally, from the end of the fifth lunar month to the end of June! The society has temporarily abandoned dishes with a lot of fish, meat, greasy and greasy, and mushrooms, winter mushrooms, bamboo shoots, Toona sinensis, etc. are popular, especially mushrooms and winter mushrooms, which are the only fresh and delicious products in vegetarian food.</p>
<p>Mushroom 丨 also known as shiitake mushroom, and winter mushroom are sisters, and in botany, they belong to the same type of cryptogams. The body is like an umbrella, the large one has a diameter of four or five inches, the surface is dark brown, and the inside is light yellow. It grows on trees such as locust trees, and has a fragrant smell and a more delicious taste.</p>
<p>The planting of mushrooms is done by people who grow mushrooms, 丨 most of whom are from Chuzhou and scattered all over the place 丨 looking for suitable mountainous areas (which must have many of the above-mentioned types of trees and be surrounded by more than twenty miles, too large is not suitable), and trying to buy them. Then, all the trees on the mountain are cut off at the roots, and the top is covered with straw. Then, they are allowed to be rained and sunbathed, and gradually changed. Those trees, which are suddenly cut off, still contain a lot of nutrients in their roots. This quality, from bottom to top, will develop and become mushrooms. In the first year, the mushrooms produced are small and withered, and cannot be harvested. After two years, they are large and numerous. At this time, the mushroom growers can get a harvest. Famous places for mushroom production in my country, such as Anhui, 丨 Ningguo · Tunxi · 丨 Zhejiang · 丨 Lanxi · Chuzhou 丨 Fujian, 丨 Jianning 丨 Jiangxi and other places, all have large quantities of production. However, because the Chinese people mostly stick to the old methods of planting and cultivation and do not know how to improve, and sometimes due to various relationships such as the weather and geographical location, the products vary in quality, with advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, in recent years, sales in the market have mostly been seized by Japanese goods. The advantage of Japanese goods lies in their ability to apply scientific methods to planting and cultivation, and the products are uniform in pieces, and the color and taste are excellent. In the past one or two years, some new methods have been used in my country, such as Ningguo and Chuzhou, and the results are very good. We sincerely hope that all producing areas can quickly research and improve in order to develop this promising mushroom growing business.</p>
<p>Since there are many places where mushrooms are produced as mentioned above, the quality of the goods also varies slightly depending on the place of origin. For example, products from Ningguo and Tunxi are thick and fat; while those produced in Lanxi and Jianning are thinner. Other differences include color, shape, and smell. However, these cannot be easily distinguished unless you are in the industry. General identification is based on (1) large pieces and thick volume; (2) black or dark brown mushroom cap surface; (3) mushroom folds 丨 pleats inside 丨 yellow and bright color; (4) small and short mushroom stem; (5) fragrant smell. Those with these five points are good products. As for the identification of Japanese goods, the mushroom cap is generally black and slightly shiny, the texture is thick and the flesh is very fat, the mushroom folds are bright yellow, and the aroma is stronger. Mushrooms are packed in baskets. 丨 Japanese goods are marked with floral names outside the box 丨 The shape is either square or round, and each weighs about one hundred and fifty or sixty catties to more than one dan. The price is calculated by the dan.</p>

<h3>To the Aspiring Youth</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times is constantly moving forward, and the torrent of culture is surging throughout. Young people, do you not want to be a lagger of the times? Do you not want to be eliminated by the times? Please take the path of learning, this is a broad and bright future.</p>
<p>Many young people say that life is miserable? Do you not say that life is dim? Young people, only the path of learning can regulate the bitterness of your life, only the path of learning can beautify your dim life. However, facts tell me that most aspiring young people, driven by the environment, leave the school and take the path of life, to pursue food, clothing, shelter and transportation to maintain life, and give up the mission of following the times. Aspiring young people, will you forever be a slave to life? Will your will forever be stripped by life? No, no, you have left the school, but you are not unable to pursue learning, nor can you carry out your original intention of moving forward. As long as you can understand the responsibility to the times, as long as you have an iron-like desire for knowledge, as long as you can recognize the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>Young people, I am also a 22-year-old young man, and I have already had a career, but I am very excited about reading, because I have two rules for self-encouragement and self-reliance, which are "to maintain my life with work, and to use the surplus energy to explore infinite knowledge." I believe that "work" and "reading" are the most proper paths in life.</p>
<p>This summer, I was allowed to have time, and I entered the first branch of the spare-time tutoring night school run by this newspaper. Although it cost me more than ten miles of transportation, although a day's work is enough to tire me out, I bring my tired body and mind into the school, and I always exchange it for a happy body and mind, because many of my doubts are happily inspired, and the tired body and mind are unconsciously restored.</p>
<p>Young people, if your time allows, I hope you will also enter a night school that is suitable for you to make up for all kinds of knowledge. Otherwise, you should also do your best to use your spare time to borrow or buy some useful books to study by yourself. In this way, you can directly increase your knowledge and become a figure of the times, and indirectly increase your life skills and the efficiency of serving the society. That is such a bright future.</p>

<p>— Written by Xu Yu</p>
<p>This is a fragment from the diary of a newlywed. My lifelong event, the marriage concerning my lifelong happiness, was lightly concluded by the words of a matchmaker and the command of my parents. My body, already devoid of a soul, arrived at this unfamiliar "in-law's house" like a puppet stepping onto the stage amidst a burst of drums and music.</p>
<p>In this day and age, everything is expensive, and marrying off a daughter is indeed no easy task. Moreover, my family has no permanent property and relies solely on my old father's hands to make a living, barely making ends meet. How could we have much money for a dowry? As a result, I have suffered all kinds of humiliation and immense pain. Alas! In these times, it's truly better to die than to be poor!</p>
<p>The ancient saying goes, "Marry a wife for her virtue," but nowadays, most people harbor the extravagant hope of "marrying a wife for her wealth." After spending some betrothal money, besides acquiring a person—no, a machine for producing sons—into the family, they also hope to receive a generous dowry. Ideally, they would even rely on their father-in-law to secure an official position. Only then would they, for the sake of wealth and power, extend their love to the entire house and treat their daughter-in-law as a "Bodhisattva." Otherwise, she would inevitably be regarded as "mud underfoot," trampled upon, and abused, worse than pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>As I sat on the edge of the bed with my head covered and my eyes lowered like a Bodhisattva, I heard the womenfolk in the next room chattering about my dowry, discussing its merits and shortcomings...</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be upset, old lady. Although your daughter-in-law's dowry is meager, her needlework is excellent, and her appearance is very dignified..."</p>
<p>"Alas! That poor and wretched look makes me angry just looking at it."</p>
<p>Hearing my mother-in-law's tone, I thought of the future and felt a chill run down my spine. A group of male guests crowded him in, all with tipsy expressions, making a "nonsensical" ruckus in the bridal chamber, and demanding that I offer him wine. I had no choice but to stand up and hold the pot when suddenly a male guest shouted, "Look! This bride has six fingers!" Thereupon, everyone echoed and wanted me to stretch out my hand.</p>
<p>"Her hands have so much old skin, like a poor old woman!" the young sister-in-law said, proudly stretching out her jade-like hands.</p>
<p>"How can she be as pampered as you are in our family? She has to rely on hard work to survive. If she doesn't work, she'll starve," my mother-in-law said deliberately to me, with a contemptuous look on her face. Alas, the fact that we are born with a pair of hands to earn a living through hard work is seen as a shameful thing. In that case, are those parasites who depend on others and gain without labor glorious?</p>
<p>"Old brother, you must cherish your new sister-in-law! You are eighteen years older than her! Don't treat her like you treated those two deceased sisters-in-law, hitting and kicking her whenever you're unhappy! That's the right way!" The speaker was a young lady who looked like a female student.</p>
<p>Her words made me feel that this brightly lit bridal chamber was shrouded in gloom and doom, like a haunted hell, making my hair stand on end.</p>
<p>At this time, he was already dead drunk and collapsed on the bed, snoring loudly, leaving me alone to sit blankly, looking at the pair of red candles dripping tears, as if they were saddened by my future fate. I could no longer suppress the grief in my heart, and I lay on the embroidered pillow, swallowing my sobs and crying my heart out.</p>
<h3>Alas! Summer Hygiene?!</h3>

<h3>Casual Notes from Chonglou</h3>
<p>— Peng Nian</p>
<p>(1) The Most Superior Clothing Material</p>
<p>Some people think that homespun cloth is coarse and feel disgusted, insisting on buying wool and serge to flaunt their wealth. In fact, this is due to an overly strong sense of vanity. Originally, wearing clothes is not for showing off wealth, but simply for practicality. Domestically produced homespun cloth is not only durable and elegant in color, but also very dignified when worn, because it can reclaim our rights, resist foreign goods, and drive away fashionable women, bringing us closer to the working class. Therefore, I believe it is the most superior clothing material.</p>
<p>(2) Being Talkative Makes You a Fool</p>
<p>Being talkative is inherently dull and dangerous. Bad words can lead to death, or at least to quarrels. Therefore, smart people take "keeping their mouths shut like a bottle" as a wise way to protect themselves. This time, B seduced someone's young daughter, and I criticized him a few words, which provoked B to hurl insults and almost resort to violence. This was my own fault, and I can't blame anyone but myself. I should just slap my own mouth. However, it is a pity that a young man with a bright future would regard loyal advice as unpleasant to the ear and willingly succumb to the abyss of love. But after thinking carefully about the few words I said, I really feel they were not worth it.</p>
<p>(3) The Magic of Female Servers</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been hot, and ice parlors have sprung up everywhere. Last night, I passed by Avenue Edward VII and saw the entrance of XX Ice Parlor crowded with people, packed like sardines. Driven by curiosity, I stopped to watch. Inside, the customers were all seated, with hardly any empty seats. Several female servers were using their charm and smiles on the customers, no wonder the customers were watching so intently. At the same time, I saw that the shop next door was deserted. It turned out that the other shop did not have female servers. So I thought, "In Shanghai, only women can make money by deception!" How great is the magic of female servers!</p>
<p>(4) Truly Modern Women</p>
<p>In Shanghai, people call women who wear fashionable clothes, beautiful decorations, slim figures, and curled hair with high heels "modern women." This is truly a wonderful term that celebrates aestheticism. In fact, truly modern women are not like this, and they are not in this bustling city. If we want to find truly modern women, we must go to the countryside. Look, aren't the women in the countryside self-sufficient, cultivating their own food, digging their own water, and weaving their own clothes? They don't rely on men at all. This is what truly modern women are like. Therefore, I say that urban modernity is modernity of cosmetics, while rural modernity is modernity of morality. Morality of modernity, is true modernity!</p>

<h3>Double-Gun General</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In Praise of Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>First Poem:</p>
<p>News of the front arrives daily, the general grinds his iron teeth,</p>
<p>Urging the old troops and Shang Zhen to drive forward, shaking heaven and earth, causing ghosts and gods to weep.</p>
<p>At Fengkou, they pursued and killed hundreds of corpses,</p>
<p>Besieged and defended the arena, enduring the days.</p>
<p>The enemy leaves North China to invade Zhangbei,</p>
<p>I seek righteousness and achieve it.</p>
<p>Second Poem:</p>
<p>Killing enemies still requires a pair of guns,</p>
<p>Japanese devils fall to the ground in pairs.</p>
<p>Acting as an executioner to punish the wolves,</p>
<p>Treating the battlefield as a execution ground.</p>
<p>Without bullets, it is difficult for double guns to make a sound,</p>
<p>But the broadsword is powerful and flies everywhere.</p>
<p>The edge is first tried at Dolun,</p>
<p>Who says there is no one... (To Pay)</p>

<h3>Female Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am a young man in my twenties, and also a small clerk who has just completed my studies. My monthly salary is seven old dollars. There is no one else in my family, nor any family property, only an old mother who is sixty years old.</p>
<p>About three years ago, my mother, seeing that I was getting older, and wanting to relieve her mind of a burden, relied on the words of a matchmaker and arranged a marriage for me with a girl from a neighboring town. I couldn't go against her wishes, so I had to silently agree.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, it has been three years in a flash. A few days ago, my mother wrote to me saying, "You are so old now, you can start a family. Moreover, I am old and weak, often sick, and there is no one to take care of me. What if something unexpected happens? So, my intention is to choose a day for you to get married this year or next year, to fulfill my long-cherished wish." Sir, you think, in this present time of high living standards, earning a meager few dollars a month is difficult enough to maintain the status quo, how can I talk about marriage? So I want to postpone it for a few years. But, thinking of my elderly mother, what should I do? Alas! It is truly difficult for me.</p>
<p>Sir, you are a mentor to young people, a bright light in the darkness, a guide for those who have lost their way. What do you think should be done about this? "Marry" or "not"? Please give me a satisfactory answer. I don't think you will refuse, will you? I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Yang Xueshu</p>
<p>Editor's note: Originally, in these times, apart from a few lucky people, who rely on their ancestors' inheritance, or because they have studied for a few more years, and have been promoted by others, gaining a superior position in society; for other ordinary people, it is impossible to rely on the money earned by twenty-four ribs to support their wives, children, and elders. Therefore, the trend in the future is that both husband and wife must have their own skills to make a living. No one can live as a parasite on the other. Mr. Yang should earnestly inquire whether your fiancée can be diligent and thrifty. Thrift can reduce expenses, and diligence can generate wealth. Spinning, weaving, farming, and needlework are all ways to generate wealth. If so, then getting married sooner is also fine. If not, then you can only give up and wait for the future. With the economic crisis, (1) birth control and (2) the idea of single-child families are growing day by day, and it is necessary to find ways to help. Promoting female self-reliance is truly the best way.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (31)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>These few words hit him hard in the heart, and he could no longer control himself. At first, he stared at Meizi's kind black eyes, standing still without moving, then he suddenly hugged her tightly, burying his face in her hair, an indescribable sadness surged in his chest, his throat tightened, and he sobbed like a child. Meizi! Meizi who drifted to a foreign country, the emotionally fragile Meizi, could not withstand this emotional sorrow. Her eyes suddenly filled with hot tears, and like a mother, like a sister, like a lover, she gently patted Shiqiao's back and stroked his shoulders. From her choked voice, she called out,</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, Mr. Li, tell me, tell me..."</p>
<p>Hearing this sorrowful cry, Shiqiao sobbed even more, wanting to tell her all his grievances, but he couldn't utter a single word. They moved their feet while embracing, Shiqiao sat on the edge of the bed, and Meizi sat on him. Their eyes met again, and after staring at each other for a while, hot tears flowed again. Meizi spoke first,</p>
<p>"What exactly is it for? We are all so unfortunate!"</p>
<p>Shiqiao raised his eyes to look out the glass window, shook his head, wanting to speak but not speaking. How could he tell Meizi that a dignified man like him hadn't even had a meal?</p>
<p>But Meizi was determined not to let him off today, as if she couldn't rest assured if he didn't tell her.</p>
<p>"Of course, I don't have the ability to help you. But you can talk to me and relieve your depression!"</p>
<p>"Meizi, you are too kind to me! It's not worth it!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that! Although I am already married, I can't comfort you for a long time, but I hope I can be with you for one day or one more day. Tell me!"</p>
<p>"I..." He paused. "I currently have an urgent need for money. You, please lend me a few dollars, I will return it to you in a few days, because..." Shiqiao finally said this in a roundabout way, and after saying it, he avoided eye contact and looked around the room.</p>
<p>Before Meizi could reply, the sound of Lihanoff's footsteps came on the steps. She quickly took out a banknote from her body and put it in Shiqiao's hand, wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with one hand, straightened her clothes, and hurried out of the room. She pretended to be casual and called out,</p>
<p>"Lihanoff, are you back?" To Shiqiao, this voice sounded hoarse, and had an uncontrollable tremor.</p>
<p>Shiqiao then sighed, and this sigh seemed to release all the depression he had been holding back for days, and his chest felt much relieved.</p>
<p>But when he realized the banknote he was holding in his hand, he became painful again. So he simply rolled onto the bed and cried and shouted heartily alone. He went... everything disappeared. He seemed to have become a different person.</p>
<p>"You may... the useless Shiqiao... yourself...</p>
