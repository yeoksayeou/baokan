<h3 id="c14">再論法佔我國南海九小島仲 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>法海軍於本年四月七日至十二日間。樹三色旗於我國南海之九小島七月十四日其事稍洩於外。迨二十五日。乃宣布正式佔領。九島者·爲凱夷·達姆巴賽伊吐巴·杜克斯·萊吐·梯都·史伯拉德雷及二附島。位於法屬安南英屬婆羅洲及美屬菲列濱之間。距粤海岸約百數十里。九島面積合計爲三百畝。不足半平方英里。自法方公布以來。我國各方均大震駭。蓋我國於此數島。向雖僅居漁民。而領土之權。則不容被侵今法艦突然宣布佔領。其形跡殊無異於侵略。况同時在日人方面又盛播各島早爲日商所發見之消息。表示與法方攘奪之决心。國際糾紛。正方興而未已乎。法方初不欲此事之引動國際注意謂九島之佔領。僅爲航行上之便利計。嗣鑒於各方之反響。乃辯爲[絶無帝國主義意味之佔領。]然而無論如何。此數小島之佔領問題。已引起國際間之密切注意矣。</p>
<p>吾人對此問題。當自我國主權與國際關係二方面觀察。之第一·在我國主權方面。法人所佔九。島旣爲我國之領土。則政府當向法方作切實之抗議。查法方公布九島之位置。謂在緯線十度北。經線一百十五度東似與我國之西沙羣島相近。或即爲羣島之一部。法人對於西沙羣島。埀涎已久。在三年前。即曾爲佔取之嘗試。當日糾紛。至今猶成懸案。西沙大小島嶼二十餘。散列海中。今度之被佔者。或即南端之小島耳。昨哈瓦斯巴黎電。傳法政府於一九三○年四月十三日曾佔取九島中最大之史伯拉德雷島。即爲一可能之證據。夫沿海之小。島縱在經濟上無價。値而在邊疆之保衛。上則有重要之作用。近百年來。我國因沿海島嶼被人佔取。致成門户大開之勢。今此數島。又遭强隣之埀涎。無論爲主權計。爲邊防計。我國政府均不能不據理力爭者也。第二·自國際關係上觀之。法國之佔領九小島·不啻爲列强重返於爭取及保障殖民地政策之先聲。蓋便利航行云者。乃顯明之設辭。而軍事之目的。則爲無可掩飾之事實。九島位於新加坡及香港之半途。屏障安南。就法國在遠東之地位言。其軍事上之效用殊大。從另一方面言。則於法有利。即不免與他國有害。故法人佔領之後。東京電訊。即播日人先曾佔取之空氣。其說有二。一謂有名橋本氏之日商。曾於一九一八年十月七日要求日政府佔領該。島。又一謂有平田末次者。曾於島上經營一鑛並曾名該島爲平田羣島。日法間對於此九小島競爭之劇烈。事已彰著。憶九一八事變之初。英法曾以妥恊之態度·希冀日人爲列强遠東殖民地之保護人。迨日本與國聯絶裾。獨占之野心暴露。帝國主義者乃知以本身實力保護殖民之必要。倫敦經濟會議之失敗。尤足以促成此種之趨向。惟此種趨向之推進。有形及無形中·似均以我國之邊陲爲對象。横琴島案過去未久。南海九島復被侵佔。瞻望前途。令人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>法政府公布佔領九島之消息。已閱五六日。而我國政府猶在［派員勘測］與［準備抗議］之中。夫外交上之行動。宜切實而迅速。九島之地位形勢固應詳加考察。惟其應以最短時期。完成調查之工作。並提出嚴重之抗議實爲國人所共同主張。設敷衍因循。則强者之貪慾無限。我國之後患。尙堪設想耶。</p>

<h3 id="c55">共黨要員蔡劍唐等宣言 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>揭發共黨的錯誤與罪惡基於覺悟乃投歸國民黨前共黨中央軍委書記蔡劍唐等七人、發表反共宣言、原文如下、</p>
<p>在黑暗中摸索得到的、將永遠是黑暗、中國共產黨儘在黑暗中摸索進行、牠的終極、只會鑄成更多的錯誤與罪惡、一直臨到沒落、死亡的命運、我們過去俱是忠實的中國共產黨員、現在我們是堅决轉變到燦爛的三民主義族幟下來了、這不是什麽前後矛盾、更不是什麽背叛階級、這是我們在黑暗中摸索經過沉痛回憶得到的收穫、這是我們生命史上開始了一個新的紀元、</p>
<p>我們的轉變、不是偶然的、是了解到幾個根本問題、</p>
<h3 id="c56">一·中國究竟是一個怎樣的國家 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>誰也不會否認中國是一個經濟落後的國家、在貧弱的國家中、只有大貧與小貧、根本說不上階級的對立、這一基本了解、足　擊馬克斯階級鬥爭學說而無遺了、不適合中國國情的共產主義、搬到中國來、結果使中國更陷於貧弱、不能造產反益破產、事實上也是如此、中國共產黨絲毫不曾作造產的工作、完完全全努力於破產的暴行、</p>
<h3 id="c57">二·我們需要民族復興呢根本不要民族觀念呢 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>不論是意大利民族·日耳曼民族·大和民族·以至於斯拉夫民族、這些自强民族例子、他們俱能發揮民族自信力及民族獨立精神、返觀我中華民族、恰如一盤散沙、正是缺乏民族自信力民族獨立精神的結果、目前中國國維非常嚴重、一致團結抗日、是救中國復興民族的唯一良圖、中國共產黨、却提出下層統一戰線與民族統一戰線對立、如鼓動抗日士兵擅殺抗日長官等、長城一帶的抗日血戰悲壯的犧牲、原爲民族求生存、共產黨却盡其後防搗亂的能事、不惜與日方勾結牽制抗日軍事、中國共產黨的喪心病狂、顯見沒有民族觀念、一切惟以斯拉夫民族意旨爲依歸、沒有民族觀念、何言革命、直是中華民族的蟊賊、</p>
<h3 id="c58">三·一省或數省的首先勝利是否封建割據 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>中國當前是臨到極嚴重的國難、是需要民族力量的統一、誰要企圖分裂民族力量、誰求是中華民族共同的敵人、中央本了共赴國難極力消弭内爭、凡有碍於民族力量的統一者、中央均不憚苦心考慮、以求政治途徑的解决、中國共產黨在此國難期中、可以不要抗日、一省或數省的蘇維埃地盤不可不爭取、其破壞統一、正同於一般封建割據、然其危險更超過十百倍、東北淪亡於日帝國主義、而蘇維埃地盤内成功卽是蘇俄的附庸、</p>
<h3 id="c59">四·中國共產黨是日益發展抑是日趨崩潰 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>從中國共產黨錯誤的政治路線推測、可肯定其必然崩潰、從中國共產黨的現狀來說、可證明這一肯定之完全正確、路線一個一個的改變、錯誤不斷的重複、根本不了解中國革命的需要、當然會舉棋不定、以至不可收拾、中國共產黨儘管大肆其武斷宣傳、高唱其革命高潮的來到、實際徒自欺欺人、總檢共黨歷年活動、無處不盡其擾亂作用、在赤區極目荒凉、廬舍爲壚、農村經濟破產無遺、卽在非赤色區域亦力施其破壞手段、然一經共黨茶毒、民衆對共黨仇視益深、共黨組織力量的遞次削弱、卽其政治破產必然的結果、共黨引爲炫耀先進的上海黨、不惟組織之薄弱可憐、共黨所謂自身階級之工人、亦大多均不願供其利用、而共黨偏云爭取工人大多數之確有把握、發展組織的、九一八號召與一二八號召、黨員號稱四五千、不過窮蹙掙扎、虚張聲勢、黨員實則不足數百人、羣衆基礎、更不知在何處、黨員脫黨已成潮流、讓共黨智窮力拙、掩飾其崩潰的現狀、鐵的事實、很明白擺在人們的面前、中國共產黨已走上死亡的道路、</p>
<h3 id="c60">五·誰是中國革命的唯一領導者 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>布爾塞維克的道路、事實告訴了我們以此路不通、無疑的目前只有唯一的三民主義、才足以救中國、三民主義指示了我們、要民族自决、才能脫離次殖民地的地位、指示了我們要建立眞正人民革命政權、並指示了我們要就中國國情解决民生問題、以節制資本平均地權的正確辦法、總理的民生主義、反覆的解釋了病態的馬克思學說、確定了民生史觀的哲學基礎、我們堅决相</p>
<p>信只有偉大的三民主義、才是救中國的唯一主義、實行三民主義革命的中國國民黨、才是領導中國革命的唯一革命政黨、</p>
<p>認淸歷史的現階段、緊接着歷史的輪軸前進、我們是毅然從布爾塞維克的營壘轉變到三民主義的旗幟下來、我們相信這是一偉大的轉變、、</p>
<p>我們深知道尙徬徨於黑暗中的中國共產黨、共產主義靑年團的同志們、是充滿着苦痛、感覺無出路的、我們熱烈的希望從政治上、從個人血的敎訓中迅卽轉變、勇敢的站在三民主義革命的戰綫上來、一同携手向着光明的前途邁進、蔡劍唐·先大啟·杜月英·王履冰·許賢　·趙迎春·何本根·二十二·七·二四</p>

<p>看了賢賢的那篇『紅丸』後，早有幾句話也要說說。實在這東西蔓延得太普遍了，不僅上海，幾乎全國都有被紅色巨浸所捲沒的趨勢，大可　之爲『新赤禍！』其蔓延之速，與爲禍之烈也無不超過共產黨。共匪還不過蹂躪數省土地，遭損害的是一部分人民的生命財產；新赤禍却如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，不止於一方隅，足以枷鎖全民族。而且共匪尙可以兵力勦辦，新赤禍旣已蔓延，卽不易覓得根本禁絶之道；鴉片之禁不能絶，就是前例！</p>
<p>其實，鴉片之爲禍，也不可與新赤禍同日而語，欲禁絶鴉片，本非不可能事。大家知道，鴉片是　粟的汁，鶯粟必須栽種，又必須有相當時日長成果實，絶對不可以個人秘密。而紅丸却是可以在一間小室中製造，以供給多數消費者。從前種鶯粟的地方不多，現在纔連江蘇也有種植的，如果對種植者厲行取締要同時嚴禁外來的輸入，未嘗不可禁絶。惟有紅丸，隨時隨地可以秘密製造，並可以大量製造；卽使破獲，又可以另設一個秘密製造機關；更不比鴉片，多數地方不產在本地，要到别地去販運，紅丸蔓延之速，這也是一大原因。</p>
<p>吸鴉片是貴族化的，在目下，腰包裹沒有二八開，莫想一榻横陳，賢賢是這麽說。我想未必，吸紅丸也同樣的非有二八開不可呢。事實上現在吸紅丸者固較吸鴉片爲多但其代價，則紅丸之費，往往超過鴉片。或者要這麽說罷；吸鴉片的器具，須考究精美，最低限度，亦必須有一支好好的烟槍，吸起來時，又要從容地裝上斗子，一筒呼畢，仍須把槍放下，從容地裝第二簡，不比吸紅丸那麽簡便快速，用不着一筒一筒的裝，一口氣連續不斷，可盡數十丸，而勞動家（例如黃包車夫）之捨烟取丸，多數正是爲了簡便快速。還有一層：如果吸烟者是自己然熬烟的話，那必須大洋買土，慢慢地熬成烟，紅丸則隨時可用八開購，購到卽吸，所以吸鴉片的，多屬有閒階級和長衫同志，從這方面看起來，自然像自貴族化了；可决不能以耗費多寡爲標準，吸紅丸的也常有吸幾塊餞一天的呢。現在已有許多地方禁丸不禁烟，這更說明了新赤禍之爲害，甚於鴉片。</p>

<p>汗是夏天的特產品。由於辛苦用力的工作而發生的也有；過度的娛樂也有。</p>
<p>月閒階級以及有產階級者，其出汗的機會較少。他們或她們，在電風扇的活動之下，在冷氣管的圍繞之間，飲着冰其熱感。他們是不大會出什麽汗的。就有，也不過是應應景兒在鼻尖上綴着幾點，不但並不發臭，而且，據說還是香噴噴的丨丨而尤以少奶小小姐太太們爲甚，因爲伊們身上通撲着最好的舶來爽身粉，暗地裏發出一種香氣，設若更出了點汗，於是身上所敷的粉與汗溶化起來，便生出一種化學作用的迷人的香味，這香味却從來下曾見厭於紳士們及一切高尙男子們的。這種汗，該予以相當贊美，並許其有存在之可能。</p>
<p>然而，轉過來說，有一種令你聞了要作三日嘔的臭汗，使你不敢領敎而又常得領敎到的那便是苦力們了。</p>
<p>終日在炎陽之下蒸發着的穿着大土布衣服的小工們和黃包車夫們，旣沒有片刻暇暑淴什麽浴，所以整天出幾十次的大汗，也祗好讓他濕了又乾，乾了又濕，這樣循環往復，日積月累，（他們或者是不懂得什麽呌作衛生，或者沒有幾件衣服好換，是以每件衣服都穿上多天，）這就要精鍊出一種酸性的異乎尋常的惡味來。無怪乎在路上扭揑着的摩登小姐們常用一方小手帕遮掩着伊的玉鼻，還要鎖着伊的經過點染過的柳眉，現出鄙夷的態度來了。</p>
<p>我們享受遠不如富人們的適意，但也不如苦力的過於辛勞，我們常是出汗，當自己感味到時，並不覺其臭，反以爲香，但這是偏心的主觀的　判定，其實我們這批所謂『臭男子』者流，那裏有什麽香味呢！</p>
<p>汗是夏天的特產品，出在小姐們的身上是香的，出在苦力們的身上却變得臭了。然而『汗』不知此，却偏要出在苦力們的身上，唉，天曉得了。</p>

<p>在報上見着頭奬五十萬元的發財廣告，我底内心不覺怦然有所動了，眞的，這『五十萬』是一個多大的數目呵！聽聽已夠使人羨煞，要是一旦着了，其喜更不用說得，一切所謂艱難的問題，都可迎刃而解······看着報，我呆呆地在想。</p>
<p>『這五十萬元怎樣去支配呢？』這問題開台使我煩惱了，惟恐綁匪會乘機，强盜會上門。</p>

<p>於是，樂善好施者，施茶咧，施痧藥水咧，···源源的實惠貧困，貧困者眞是受惠不淺。</p>
<p>不盡然吧？往往一個苦力的，感受了暑熱去向施藥者求些解危品，他們的下人會仗勢欺人的呼叱着，報以白眼，除非你是和他有交情。否則他會把整批的拿回家去送親戚，不是個人的是這樣，一個拖送的團體也是如此。的確，施主是蒙在鼓裏沒有知道。</p>
<p>不信，請看什麽賑災？什麽捐？私囊中飽的很多很多！假着施濟的幌子，募捐的名詞，胆大妄爲的幹着卑劣的行爲，使得施主寒心。</p>

<p>寒賤苦緃戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情盛世民望着他，是位大姑娘的樣子，便道：小姐這是趙連長家嗎？桂枝看他身上穿了灰色襖子，雖沒有肩章帽子，總有些像軍人的樣子原有些害怕。現在經他一問話，覺得這人，也沒有有什麽不可以接近，就答道：對了，這裏是趙家你找誰？盛世民道：我要見他們老太爺告訴一句話。趙連長本來是要回來一躺，因爲這兩天，正趕上總司令要來檢閱軍隊，他離不開身。他說楊家那件喜事，他一定辦，讓老太爺先給人家回個信，免得姑妨找急。盛世民作夢不想到男女二家乃是院鄰而且碰到了本人，敞開來這樣一說，臊得桂枝羞又不是，惱又不是，只瞪了兩眼望他。盛世民還是不解，就道：大姑娘請你向裏面言語一聲罷。我身上不舒服，嚷不出來。桂枝本想駡他兩句，一看人家這樣子，却也是不忍去駡？一轉身就走回家來。江氏道？你在大門口，和誰說話啦。桂枝道：一個大兵，瞧他那胡說覇道的。江氏道胡說覇道，你不理他也就完了。桂枝頓了一頓，才道：他來找人的，我怎能夠不理他呢？江氏道：他找我們呢····桂枝道：你瞧，你眞想不開，是找我們的，我還不把他引了進來。江氏這算明白了，乃是找趙家的，自己先到大門口看看，然後再進後院去。桂枝在屋子裏，先聽到趙老太爺走了出來，就是一陣忙亂，在大門口談說了許多話，將那個人竟攙了進去了。江氏也是在裏面忙亂着，未曾走回家來。桂枝在家度雪天，也是無事，端了一杯熱茶，靠了窗户，隔着玻璃，只管向外面看着雪。那後面院子裏的說話聲，略微可以聽到一點，只聽見趟翁和自己母親，都不住的歎氣，似乎很可惜這個病人似的。（一四四）</p>

<p>假使你在化妝修飾的時候，嘴　上厚厚地，重重地塗上了點唇膏，那麽你的嘴唇，難铭要有變硬的趨勢。</p>
<p>假使你的嘴唇民經變硬了，不用懊喪，祇要用甘油檸檬來塗上，就可使嘴唇柔軟，並且增加美的顏色，達到旣紅且艶的標準。</p>
<p>假使你所用的點唇膏是乾的，看上去似乎沒有油質在其間，那麽你用點唇膏之前，先在嘴唇上搽些潤面膏卽可。（潤面膏就是普通的雪花膏，白玉霜，夏士蓮等類）</p>
<p>假使你的嘴唇是厚的，最好不用完全塗到，嘴唇的兩條邊上，千萬不要去塗：假使你的嘴唇是薄的，那麽要完全塗到，卽使塗出了唇邊，也不妨。</p>
<p>點唇膏塗好之後，最好把唇膏的顏色，稍揩去些。要和道普通的鏡子，尤其是糊塗，不平，劣等的鏡子，照出來的像，常的比眞的要薄暗些，模糊此。</p>
<p>最科學化，藝術化的點唇膏塗法，並不像大多數摩登姑娘一般的想像。普通認爲最適當最便捷的，是横的塗法，就是從嘴唇的左端塗至右端，再從右端塗至左端，其實這樣不算最好的塗法。應當改爲縱的塗法，就是從嘴唇上邊塗到下邊，再從下邊塗到一邊，因爲這部分的皮膚也是自上至下，自下至上生長的：同時再順依唇的線紋而塗。這樣的塗法，比較要多費些時間，但是一塗之後，立卽滿意，如若不信。請卽一試。（佩莫）</p>
<h3 id="c155">穿襪須知 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>沒有再比襪上有了一個洞更討厭更憤怒的了。千眞萬確的，襪上有洞，很不雅觀。事實是如此：每天費在考究穿襪上的時間，應當比我們平常祗不過約略注意一下的時間，要加多好幾倍咧！形狀不合，尺寸不對，式樣不新的襪，常使我們受到襪的氣，眞夠使我們麻煩不了。　例如襪的尺寸，各種式樣，各種牌號，都是不同的。有幾家襪廠所製造的，常比我們我們平常所穿的大一半或小一半。沒有再比脚踝上和膝蓋上襪縐不挺，或襪統變曲，花紋歪斜，更難看更討厭的了。又一方面，沒有再比在新襪的　部和趾部上有了破洞，更難看更討厭的了。穿了抽絲脫線的襪，也是怪不好意思的。</p>
<p>假使襪上有花紋，襪後有合縫直線，襪根有尖角形等圖案，等起來格外要當心，第一要挺，第二要整，第三要緊。要得到這三個條件，先去揀選尺寸相配，式樣相宜的襪，然後用　腰吊襪來吊起。單用一副圓圈的寛緊帶，總不能滿意的。</p>
<p>至於應穿何種顏色，何種式樣的襪，那是不能一槪而論，你喜歡穿什麽就穿什麽，不過氣候和時令要注意的。例如現在夏天，當然穿絲或紗的襪，顏色以白，淡黃，荷色等淡色爲宜。假使你是怕冷的，那麽到了寒天，還是放棄祇好看而不衛生的薄絲襪，去穿卽厚且暖的毛絨襪；否則生了凍瘡，受累匪淺。</p>
<p>臨了，不妨談談穿襪的迷信。我們偶一不愼，反穿了一隻反襪，認爲很不吉利的。英國姑娘却不然。伊們見自己的襪反置着，認爲很吉利的，假使反的襪是左脚的，那是大大的吉利。還有一樣奇妙的迷信，就是換了一隻新襪，第一侂睡，把日間右脚所穿的襪，放在枕頭下睡者夜間所做夢一定要實現。假使做的是惡夢，那就糟透了。（佩　）</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第五章醫藥之行政第三節近年之政令我如今槪括這種畸形政見的產物，乃是以下五種取締新醫的政令，（按本人自開業以來，所受政令，有北政府内務部登記法一次，商埠督辦時代衛生局一次，國民政府先後五次，共計七次之多，幸而每次我總合資格罷了。）</p>
<p>甲·十六年十七年間『國民政府上海特别市衛生局管理醫師（西醫）暫行章程］</p>
<p>乙·十八年衛生部公布的『醫師暫行條例』此中最窒礙難行的，就是受警察指揮和資格問題，經上海醫師公會請求放寛爲會外一般醫者着想，衛生部擬具條陳而行政院駁斥不准。</p>
<p>丙·十九年五月七日國府公布的『西醫條例』但此條例上說道施行日期以命令定之，至今沒有命令不知算施行不施行。</p>
<p>丁·十九年十二月二十七日考試院公布的『高等考試西醫師考試條例』此條例說道公布日施行，但是至今並沒有考試一回。</p>
<p>戊·二十一年經立法院通過經内政部（當然衛生署擬具了）公布的『醫師變通給證辦法』乃是全國新醫界屢次條陳的結果。</p>
<p>以上的政令，曾經由汪企張醫師大大的研究過一番，他着有『新醫資格上的幾個疑點』一文，登載在二十一年雙十特刋，又轉載在醫事彙刋第十三期，恕把汪先生的文中扼要的幾層意思，片段的摘下，也就足以代表我所要說的話，免得使本篇浪費筆墨了。『這五次公令中，或後令發布，前令失效；或兩令並立，不必說他存廢問題，而這四年中政府當局對於管理醫師無一定方針，一貫系統則明矣。』</p>
<p>『衛生局所布管理醫師（西醫）暫行章程，在衛生部醫師暫行條例頒布之後』</p>
<p>，便公告失效，但事實上並未失效。』</p>
<p>『國府公布的是西醫條例，衛部公布的是醫師暫行條例，幸虧至今國府沒有命令施行日期，否則向稱醫師的，立刻又要改稱西醫了。』</p>
<p>『考試院公布的是西醫醫師考試條例，自公布到今，是中國醫者，都沒有應考，可以說誰也不配開業。』</p>
<p>『削足適屨限制醫師資格的拙政策，無非作弄幾個誤入歧途的新醫，（指非學校出身，及不立案學校出身者而言？）</p>
<p>『照現在審查考試都是收拾幾個木已成舟的新醫，並沒有截止，將來不再產生不合格醫師，和補充合格醫師的具體辦法。</p>
<p>『在一個政府之下，忽而緊，忽而寛；忽而嚴締，忽而放任，使一班民衆生非分之心，有僥倖之得。』</p>
<p>『有時市政府允許他開業，衛生部又不許他做，一收一放的味道，實在難</p>
<p>過。』</p>
<p>『變通給證辦法，限定在十八年以前開業，而曾在病院實習五年以上，或在四年以上的學校畢業的，都得領取證書，但社會上，一則有不合以兩次資格，而已領得證書的，又如何呢？再則十八年以前開業，有什麽方法證明呢？</p>
<p>作者附啟</p>
<p>（一）我爲申報撰本文的動機，完全根據某次的演講，但我演講時，往往沒有底稿，當時就我個人十年來所記得的事，隨口說說，所以本文也是每星期隨筆寫寫，也無全稿，然而至今不知不覺已盡數萬言，而下筆潦草，語體冗雜，在所不免，友人勸我脫稿之後，另印一單行本，因想在最近用些調查功夫，將那些醫院醫師的統計，在出版時盡力校正一下。</p>
<p>（二）然而自本文發表至第十八期以後，即有一素不相識的日本人小山淸次樣將他分爲七節，譯載在六月份的同仁日文雜誌上，他對於我的醫師人數統計，和醫院的批評，有些出入，我承認我所說的三千人，確是約數，但對於他所計的三千五百零四人，也還有討論。因爲名分上的規定，太不淸楚，登記的不澈底，所以上海市内到底在那裏行醫業的有多少人，還有疑問。</p>
<p>（三）小山淸次譯文中首叙作者的地位，說是『浙江財閥中堅虞洽卿氏所長的急救時疫醫院主席醫師』，未免誤會了。按急救時疫醫院，先是故友黃楚九君創辦，而自任院長，我爲醫務董事，虞君確被推爲名譽院長，黃君故世後，繼推杜月笙氏長院，我現在经總幹事的名義，遙領院務，並不應診。</p>
<p>（四）是本人對我社會甚注意，所以本文雖論一隅之事，也有人摘譯研究，我頗希望我社會人士，也起而留心市内醫藥問題。</p>
<p>（五）本文原擬連卷首語以至結論，分爲六章，如今有人勸將市内醫事敎育，及市内流行之醫藥刋物，附帶叙述，所以在醫政篇之下，再添一章，全文將爲七章。</p>
<h3 id="c187">診病之要素 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>診病有三要焉。曰精密之診察。曰謹愼之處方。曰詳細之解說。</p>
<p>（一）診察</p>
<p>欲得正確之診斷。對症之處方。非有合法之診察不可。故診察宜精密周詳。宜審思明辨。宜有獨到之見解。宜有一定之步驟。</p>
<p>甲精密之診察</p>
<p>第一次診視病人。宜有精密之觀察。苟有疏忽。後悔莫及。病者以診斷不確。藥物誤投。而陷於危險。醫者則信用喪失。名譽斷送。兩敢俱傷。</p>
<p>乙周詳之診察</p>
<p>。診視一病。不僅在診斷其病症之爲何。又當明白病人抵抗力之程度爲何若。故診察須詳盡周到。而戒誇張虚浮疏忽忽促諸弊。今之時醫以五分鐘盡診察之能事者。其不周詳可知矣。</p>
<p>丙有獨到見解之診察對於已經多醫診治之慢性疾病。愼勿輕易根據他人之所診斷。而不親自診察。蓋前醫診斷縱不錯誤。而時間變遷或於現狀有不合也。故診察須有獨到之見解。</p>
<p>丁有條理之診察醫者當先讓病者自述經過。而耐心</p>
<p>靜聽之。其益有三。（一）診斷上可增一綫光明。（二）病人因醫師之表示同情。得精神上之安慰。（三）病家增進其信仰之心。繼則親自埀詢。以補足病人陳述未盡之意。終則爲身體之檢查。身體檢查。有時殊覺因難。蓋普通病家。習於舊醫切脈之簡單。而憚新醫家詳細之診察。醫者於此。當善爲解釋。苟遭拒絶。則亦當拒絶處方。但對於婦女身體之檢查。不可不加以謹愼。第三者之鑒臨。有時實爲必要。蓋世途險惡。人心狡詐。誣蔑陷害之事往往有之。欲免物議而保令譽。不可不防。</p>
<p>戊審思明辨之診察診察旣竟。宜彙集症狀。反覆研究。推闡病因。而求一正確之診斷。苟症狀未齊。不宜武斷。當直告病家。不失爲智。彼少年淺識之醫家。騖慕虚榮。强不知以爲知。而其結果。每多不騐。故診察宜深思也。</p>
<p>（二）處方</p>
<p>醫者之診察。病者之延請。其目的不外一紙處方。以爲攻擊病魔之具。但處方不僅恃藥物。有時飲食之禁忌。衛生條件之指導。或病人性情之矯正。亦可奏相當效果。普通觀念。以爲處方即藥方者誤也。</p>
<p>如果須開列方藥。則</p>
<p>（一）須胆大心細。詳細審愼。故處方之際。宜禁絶他人之談話諮詢。以免錯誤。對於兒童。（甲）不宜用重量。　　（乙）使藥物易於服用。</p>
<p>（二）須字跡淸楚。以免配方時失誤。鑄成大錯。簽字亦不宜過草。俾藥房有疑義時得便詢問。處方完竣。當再誦讀一遍。庶免萬一之誤。</p>
<p>（三）須有實行之可能。如對於貧苦病人。而開列貴重藥品。非獨實際上難以奉行。徒令病家陷於失望。</p>
<p>（三）處方說明</p>
<p>醫者旣詳密審慮工楷開列精確之處方矣。尤當用中文詳注服法於下。再向病家或看護女士再三說明。務求明了而後已。但看護女士。往往自作聰明。不注意調查也。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>十三副傷寒症</p>
<p>（ＰａｒｔｙＰｈｕｓｊＰａｒａｔｙＰｈｏｉｄｆｅｖｅｒ）問什麽呌做副傷寒症？</p>
<p>答副傷寒症，很像傷寒症（腸熱症），但病狀是輕些。</p>
<p>問副傷寒症是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>答也是因爲病原細菌侵入到腸内而起的。</p>
<p>問他的病原細菌，是不是就是腸熱症的病原細菌？</p>
<p>答不是。他是另外數種細菌，統稱副</p>
<p>傷寒桿。（ＢａｃｉｌｌｕｓＰａｉａｔｙｐｈｏｓｕｓ）問副傷寒桿菌共有幾種？</p>
<p>答現在所發見的ＡＢ兩型，就稱爲副傷寒桿菌Ａ型和Ｂ型。</p>
<p>問這類細菌，寄生在什麽地方？</p>
<p>答寄生於猪，牛貓，牡蠣，牛奶，水果等。也是因爲飲食不愼而和這類食物一同混入體内的。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>問副傷寒症發病的時候，病狀怎樣？答發病的時候，大槪有兩種病狀。一種是傷寒症型；一種是胃腸型。</p>
<p>問傷寒症型的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答這一型的病狀經過和傷寒症差不多；但特有的在病初比較的急激，往往伴以惡寒戰慄，惡心，嘔吐。發熱並不像傷寒症那樣有定型，往往呈弛張性。間有發生口唇匐行疹。脾腫，比較的輕度。薔薇疹較小，不定型，而現出數目很多。尿中雙　反應，陽性的較少。經過短，約二三星期。全身症狀輕度，再發或併發症很少。</p>
<p>問胃腸型的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答病人以忽然嘔吐泄瀉開始；病狀非常重篤，有呈霍亂或痢疾狀的。多數的肉中毒，是這類病型，吃了腐敗的肉類之後，數小時到十餘小時，忽然起劇烈的胃腸症狀，發熱，也見口唇的匐行疹。</p>
<p>問像霍亂那樣的副傷寒，病人呈什麽現象？</p>
<p>答病人排泄米泔汁狀的大便，排出量又很多。訴口渴，吃逆，並且驟然脫力，聲音消失，腓腸肌痙　。</p>
<p>問像痢疾那樣的副傷寒，病人呈什麽現象？</p>
<p>答起激劇的疝痛，大便中混黏液和血液，泄瀉，見裏急後重的樣子。</p>
<p>問副傷寒全經過有多少時？結果怎樣？</p>
<p>答不論那一型的副傷寒，通例一星期到三星期，回復正常。有時達五六星期以上，病人有陷於虚脫的。</p>
<p>問副傷寒確實診斷，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答應該檢查血淸或把大便行細菌學的檢查法。</p>
<p>問這種病危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>答還好。可是胃腸型的，不良。死亡率約百分之五。</p>
<p>問治療方法是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答胃腸型的，起初就應當給與　　子油，同時要洗胃，内服炭末，像阿特蘇根，血炭之類，再服輕瀉劑。傷寒型的，可照傷寒症一樣治療。</p>
<p>問怎樣預防副傷寒？</p>
<p>答檢查屠宰塲，避食不熟透的肉類。此外可參照傷寒症。（完）</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>二十三乳房的疾患</p>
<p>（甲）母乳不足</p>
<p>產後母乳雖有，但不充足，有時閉止，或全停頓，這是由於母體缺乏營養，或者精神受有非常的刺戟而來。此外若有初產婦的脂肪過多症，或經產婦前次不自授乳，以致乳腺萎縮等情，均爲乳汁不足的原因。</p>
<p>母乳不足的處置；除多攝營養物以及一切對症療法外，尙有人工太陽燈的射照，亦可催進乳腺的分泌。但孕婦分娩之後，即貸哺乳於親生兒的責任，所以產後乳不充足，或竟閉止，是皆嬰兒不幸之事。因此，母體在妊娠時，就該保養心身，强健無病，以便產後乳汁，可得純良的充足，方是根本辦法。</p>
<p>（乙）乳汁過多</p>
<p>乳腺的分泌機能，極其旺盛，哺乳方畢，乳汁仍有流溢，源源而射，或者稀薄如水，都是乳汎過多的症候，母體因此往往易起營養障碍，或貧血衰弱等患。</p>
<p>如患乳汁過多，應即少吃生乳的食物，或以布片綳帶，緊壓乳房，或用吸乳器吸去乳汁，均無不可，如果乳房覺痛，可塗猪油或凡士林。</p>
<p>（丙）乳汁鬱積</p>
<p>乳腺的分泌，不準其量而排泄，乃起鬱積之症，俗稱乳熱。在乳熱發生時，乳腺緊張，似受壓迫，而覺疫痛，大都是在產褥第三四日發生，同時，體温常在三十八度以上，可用濕布綳帶，貼壓乳房，並投瀉鹽，如其疼痛劇烈，可貼莨菪橡皮膏。</p>
<p>（丁）乳腺炎</p>
<p>化膿菌由乳房皮膚的損傷部竄入，即成乳腺炎，大都在產褥第二以迄第六星期内發生，初起時，高熱畏寒，乳房覺痛，往往成爲　蔓性的浸潤，如果發熱持久，於是患部赤腫。</p>
<p>已患乳腺炎之後，如果不很嚴重，對於浦乳，不必急於廢止，因爲有時反以哺乳，而能痊可，但須用濕布氷袋，提舉乳頭，或行温　法，然後緊張可以减輕，且能防止化膿。</p>
<h3 id="c190">談物理化學與醫學之重要性 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>吾國中學。對於物理化學等課。程度不齊。間有少數學校。其設備差强人意。然應用儀器。能供學生作個别試騐者。實如鳳毛麟用。不數數觀。故一般高中華業學生。理化知識。大都不夠。是故入醫科後。必須繼續敎授。</p>
<p>夫物理推闡力之變化。而化學分析質之内容。人類生命過程中。無時無刻。不有極複雜極微妙之變化。凡有變化。不外力與質。研習醫學。苟不從理化入手。决無解决之可能。昔英國生理學權威某君曾云。凡生理上一切問題。其最後解决。全恃化學與物理。蓋爲經騐之談。</p>
<p>按化學物理二學。關係主命。非獨動物如此。即植物亦何獨不然。譬之植物。播種于地。苟能適合土壤與氣候。籽内包含之食物營養料。如蛋白質氫氱與糖之類。經化學作用。變成根鬚及莖幹。根鬚向下吸收地内種種鑛質。莖幹向上吸收炭氧二氣。藉以發榮滋長。其間化學變遷。無窮無盡。曩之生物學者。藉顯微鏡以窺探動植物之細胞。及其组織。以爲得計。然細胞之中。含有無數原子。而細胞本身。且有呼吸分泌等作用。新陳代謝。此中嬗遞演進。又非僅恃顯微鏡所能了解。而化學之爲用尙矣。</p>
<p>就藥物學而言。例如阿刀平能使瞳孔放大。並使視覺失效。經二二三日之久。但因化學研究之進步。發明何馬刀平。其效用等于阿刀平。然視覺失效。不過二三小時。再如嗎啡爲止痛聖齋。同時有癮之可能。經化學之研究。發明科第印。其作用有時可代嗎啡。而無成癮之弊。又如咖啡素。爲利尿劑。然其功效。每不可靠。經化學研究後。發現柯柯素。其化學之構造。與咖啡素相彷。而利尿功效則優之。嗣又發明茶葉素。利尿功效。較之柯柯素爲尤著。又如痲瘋一症。其特效藥爲大楓子油。惟該油富於刺激性。能使病者嘔吐。經化學研究後。提出其刺激嘔吐作用之成分。將其酸質。融於火酒。可作皮下注射。即爲醫治麻瘋之長劑。又如金鷄納之有效原子在ＣＨＯＨ類中。腎上腺素之刺激交感神經作用。在Ｃａｔｅｃｈｏｌ類中。充類至盡。不勝枚舉。故不諳化學。而欲研究醫學者。不猶航斷港絶潢。而望至於海耶。</p>
<p>以言物理。其重要性正與化學相等。夫人體猶機器然。輪　機括。絲毫不錯。生命過程之中。寒來暑往。新陳代陳。其作用之巧妙。較之機器尤堪驚異。機器之擺動。而不生衝突者。恃彈簧爲之緩衝。人身之血液。亦有彈簧以爲緩衝。所謂Ｂｕｆｆｅｒ能使血中鹻度保持於無激烈變化。人類之需要食物。猶機器之需要燃科。機器之中。輪　之周旋。汽水之排洩。活塞之跳動。皆有節律。不能稍亂。仿之人體心臟之翕張，呼吸之進出。皮膚之分泌。曷嘗有絲毫之紊亂。故不習物理原則。而欲言醫。是爲捨本逐末。焉能有濟。</p>
<p>夫化學物理。關係醫學之重要如此。世界各國學者。莫不認爲基本科學。規定學生必須習至相當程度。方能習醫。然其辦法。極不一致。英德等國。規定學生入醫校後。對於基本科學。尙須繼續補習。在美國則學生在大學中。修滿基本科學學分後。進醫校即無須補習。以德制言。ＯｂｅｒＲｅａｌｓｈｕｌｅ之畢業生。其化學物理等科之訓練。較之出身於ＣｌｓｓｉｃａｌＧｙｍｎａｓｕｎｎ者。超過半數。兩種學生。考入醫校後。皆須補習。然出身甲種學校者。重温舊課。徒耗光陰。美制雖較合理。但高中程度及設備。至爲不齊。即在大學時。所修之學分。論量雖無甚軒輊。論質則仍極參差。亦未爲盡善盡美。世界學制之不齊。雖利弊互見。然基本科學。關係醫學之重要。固無可否認。在校讀書。固需理化知識。方能了解。即將來開業問世。雜誌論文。無相當理化程度。亦不能瀏覧。况學生一出校門。即少補習之機會。故在未進醫校前。不能不有充分之訓練也。</p>

<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>一八七○年的時候，對於創傷傳染病的研究盛極一時。克勒伯（Ｋｌｅｂｓ）氏曾於普法戰爭之際，由化膿性創傷中發見了球狀的微菌；可是當時有一部分學者不信微菌的學說，以爲創傷傳染病是腐敗發酵素作用的結果。等到一八七六年科和氏發見了脾脫疽菌的發育狀態，芽胞形成的經過和動物體感染的徑路，隨後又發見了各種的微菌，於是微菌學纔日見發達起來。</p>
<p>至於培養各種微菌的方法，自一八五八年以後，九液體培養基，馬鈴薯，白膠，凝固血淸，肉汁，凝菜等培養基都漸次應用起來，由這人工的方法，居然能培養各種的微菌。一面在顯微鏡的檢查方面，又有沙羅蒙生（Ｓａｌｏｍｏｎｓｅｎ），科和，厄爾利希（ＰａｕｌＥｈｒｌｉｃｂ）諸氏應用『亞尼林』（Ａｎｉｌｉｎ）色素發明微菌染色法。一八四四年格蘭姆（Ｇｒｎｍ）氏發明了他的特種染色法。到了一八九○年，勒夫勒（Ｌｏｆｆｌｅｒ）氏又發明了菌體鞭毛染色法。</p>
<p>巴士特氏一生對於學術上的買獻極多，最主要的約有以下三種。、</p>
<p>第一發見是［醱酵由特殊微生物的存在而起］的事實。巴氏在一八五八年，隨着孔酸醱酵的研究，又發表了關於酒精醱酵的論文。他發見了糖液因微生物的存在而被分解爲酒精和炭酸氣，於是就將醱酵歸因於微生物的作用。</p>
<p>第二發見就是［傳染病因特殊微生物在體内蕃殖而起］的事實。當時法國的絲業因爲發生蠶疫大受影響。一八六五年政府命巴氏專心研究蠶疫的原因：他費了五年的苦心，居然發見了兩種病原微菌，隨後又確定了預防的方法。</p>
<p>由他的關於醱酵的發見，更進一步，令人想到病原體的研究，這也是自然的趨勢。他當時以爲乳酸，酒精，牛酪等物的酸酵旣是因微生物的作用而起，那麽，化膿的原因也何嘗不在微生物，於是他就由純粹化學家的地位進到生物學家和醫學家的區域。其後達文（Ｄａｖａｉｎｅ）氏發見了脾脫疽菌，科和氏將這菌純粹培養成功，而巴氏又反覆試騐該菌，在一八七七年確認其爲脾脫疽的病原菌。同年他又發見了惡性水腫菌，這算是最初發見嫌氣性病原菌的嚆矢。其後又發見了葡萄狀球菌和鏈狀球菌。自從這些病原微菌次第發見了以後，於是巴氏就將比希（Ｌｉｅｂｉｇ）氏對於疾病所主張化學接觸作用說和費爾孝（Ｖｉｒｃｈｏｗ）氏的病原性細胞說或寄生性細胞說等一起撇開而確認微生物說了。</p>
<p>第三發見就是豫防接種法的應用。巴氏自從將雞吐瀉疫的病毒注射於雞體内見牠以後不再感染，於是就想出了豫防接種的方法。他施行脾脫疽菌的豫防接種，曾將羊的脾脫疽病的死亡率由二五至三○％减到一％又將牛的死亡率减到○·三四％。此外又發見了病菌通過動物體幾回以後可使毒力變化的事實。那狂犬病的豫防接種就是這種事實的應用。</p>
<p>一八六七年格拉斯哥（Ｇｌａｓｇｏｗ）地方的外科醫李士脫（ＳｉｒＪｏｓｅｐｂＬｉｓｔｏｒ）氏自從知道了巴氏對於醱酵的微生物說以後；就在外科手術方面應用防腐殺菌法而收到良好的結果（參看上文。）所以近世外科手術的發達和外傷性傳染病以及產褥熱的豫防等實際醫學方面光榮的發展長足的進步都和巴氏的研究有莫大的關係。這樣看來，巴氏的功績豈不十分偉大嗎？、</p>
<p>巴氏門下還出了許多的學者，發表了許多極有價値的成績例如始創食菌細胞說的麥去尼可夫（Ｍｅｔｃｈｎｉｋｏｆｆ）氏，發見白喉菌毒素的魯（Ｒｏｕｘ）氏，發見鼠疫菌的葉爾山（Ｙｅｒｓｉｎ）氏，施行蛇毒豫防接種的卡爾麥脫（Ｃａｈｍｅｔｔｅ）氏，發明濾菌的襄伯蘭（ＣｈａｍｂｅＩｌａｎｄ）氏等都是大名鼎鼎的學者。</p>
<p>現在再將科和氏對於微菌學方面的貢獻叙述一下。</p>
<p>科和氏的重要的工作，就是分離病原菌，試行純粹培養，確定其病原性，並且發見了許之微菌。自從科和氏以來，微菌學的發達一天甚於一天，對於病原體的研究，從此纔有了鞏固的科學的基礎；這是値得我們注意和感謝的。</p>
<p>試將巴士特氏和科和氏在微菌學研究上的異點比較起來，大抵如下。</p>
<p>（一）巴士特氏主用液體培養基，由獨創的方法，發見病原菌，將其分離培養，或試騐毒性的變化。科和氏却是應用固形培養基的。</p>
<p>（二）巴士特氏主由生活的動物體或由屍體確實取出純粹的病原菌。科和氏却用平板部養法，由各種微菌的混和物中只將所欲提出的某種微菌分離出來，加以純粹培養，免得雜菌同時發生。</p>
<p>（三）巴士特氏常生活的病原菌就顯病鏡下加以檢索科和氏却應用染色法使病原菌容易看出。</p>
<p>一八八二年當巴士特氏發見豚丹毒的病原菌並且想出用毒性減弱的病的病菌行豫防接種法的時候，科和氏也發見了結核菌。一八八四年巴士特氏熱心研究狂犬病的病理和療法的時候，科和氏也傾全力於研究人類大敵絡核病的治療和豫防方法。</p>
<p>在科和氏以前，雖已有人發見了脾脫疽的桿狀菌，但是到了一八七六年，這病原菌的純粹培養和動物試騐纔由科和氏一手完成。這就是他對於微菌學上最初的貢獻。其後又陸續發明了細菌標本因定法，［亞尼林］染色法，微顯鏡攝影法和外傷性傳染病的六種病原菌的研究，於是他的名聲就日高一日了。一八八一年發明純粹培養基；翌年發見結核菌，又發明乾熱消毒法；一八八三年到印度埃及爲學術旅行，發見了吐瀉疫弧菌（ＣｈｏｌｅｒａＶｉｂｒｉｏ）及其傳染徑路；一八九零年發明結核毒苗（Ｔｕｂｉｒｋｕｌｉｎ）；一八九二年漢堡（Ｈａｍｂｕｒｇ）地方吐瀉疫流行的時候，他曾經緃事防疫的工作；一八九七年又發明了新結核毒苗；一九零六年研究非洲的睡眠病，並且試用［阿托克西耳］（Ａｔｏｘｙｌ）治療；一九零五年得諾貝而（Ｎｏｂｅｌ）奬金。</p>
<p>科和氏門下也出了許多有名的大學者，如加夫基（Ｇａｌｆｋｙ），勒夫勒（Ｌｏｆｆｌｅｒ），派佛爾（Ｐｆｅｉｌｆｅｒ）威爾希（Ｗｅｌｃｈ），北里等，在微菌學和寄生物學上都各有甚大的貢獻。（未完）</p>

<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>悶坐無聊，想寫一點東西，不知寫什麽好。</p>
<p>隨手翻開一本雜誌，首先看到的，是一則關於隋　帝的故事。說薛道衡作了一句『空梁落燕泥』的好詩，隋煬帝自慚不如，把他殺害了，而且對他的屍身問道；『還能作『空梁落燕泥』麽？』我覺得這故事很不差，大有落樂美吻約翰的頭的風趣。但轉而想到才高也有殺頭之禍，却不禁喟然歎曰；文章還是不做的好！</p>
<p>因爲隋煬帝，想到了李後主。他被執南來，幽囚金陵，自己頗是鬱鬱，不得已而寄情於詩歌。有一天，大槪他又是牢騷滿腹了，在詞裏寫上了『故國不堪回首月明中』的句子。那知道他竟因此被殺。懷舊也不被允許，我不禁又有所感，再歎一聲；文章還是不做的好！</p>
<p>聯想眞是怪物，由李後主居然跳得很遠，想到了淸代的許多文字獄，什麽『陸麗京雪罪雲遊記』呀，『記桐城方戴兩家書案』呀，一直想到『淸風不識字，何故亂翻書』一類想入非非的牽强附會的血案，我感到文人眞是末路，除掉做狗，百不自由，一筆不愼，便會身首異處，更不禁悲從中來，進而三歎；文章還是不做的好！</p>
<p>其實，不做文章，也不能担保就不會被殺。記得若干年前，在安徽，有人因一瓶紅墨水被捕；在湖南，有人因讀郭沬若的『落葉』而被殺；因江灣，一個學生，因爲拿了一本蘇聯的小說，被拘禁了三星期。做文章旣危險萬狀，閉户讀書也會遭受到飛來的横禍。智識階級究竟何處去呢？在這裏，我眞不能不稱讚希特勒的聖明果决，和秦始皇一樣焚書坑儒，來得痛快淋漓了。文章殺頭事，得失心不知，看書放在一旁，文章還是不做的好！</p>
<p>吾鄕詩人韓耆伯詩云；『户外天如墨，一燈慘作花，欲言前路事，心已亂如蔴。］詩人心境，眞是可悲；雖然心亂如蔴，前路終須拓，荆棘滿途，刀槍架頸，我們仍是不能不載血前進，但［一錢不値是書生，］文章還是不做的好！</p>
<p>悶坐無聊，想寫一點東西，究竟寫什麽好？</p>
<h3 id="c193">『翻譯』與『編述』 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>另境先生在日前自由談上說到『編』與『著』，有過這樣的話；『現在負着文化運動任務的人，與其專去翻譯外國名著，何如謄出一部精力做一點改頭換面的編述工作。』爲着許多讀不懂的硬譯品，我也同意他的主張，在毁滅大衆本出世的時候，曾經提出過相同的意見。不過同時我不能不有點疑慮：</p>
<p>許多在那兒幹硬譯亂譯工作的人，如果改行來做『改頭換面的編述工作』，是否勝任得了？我們知道翻譯一部著作，如果對這著作有較深的理解，則無論這著作多麽深奥，無論中外文法，習慣相去得多麽遙遠，也决不致生硬到像現在許多譯品那麽令人不敢領敎的程度。聽說現在有許多翻譯家，連把原作從頭到尾瞧一遍的功夫也沒有，翻開第一行就譯，對於原作的理解，更無從談起。我聽到過一個笑話，有一位書店老　讀了高爾基四十年的中譯本，說高爾基的文章寫得不通。所以『這些書的完全沒有銷路』，而有商量之餘地者，不在於翻譯工作本身，乃在於翻譯的態度。</p>
<p>因然，因爲習慣，，風俗等等的隔膜，常常使很忠實的翻譯，也不能得到比較缺乏準備智識者的理解，如果能夠有人來做述略與大衆化的編述工作，如『毁滅』『鐵流』等的大衆本者，在目前也很有着切要。但是這編述工作我覺得實在比翻譯要困難得多，假使也用着硬譯亂譯的態度來幹，結果一定會鬧得更糟，說不定『述略』會變成『割裂』，『大衆化』會弄成『恶俗化』或『歪曲化』；因爲在這兒，除了對原作的深刻的理解之外，更需要着有賅博的素養。例如關於『唯物論辯證法』，我們已有不少的譯述，然而關於這學理的一部自己編述的大衆化的小册子，可就難找了。此無他，因爲最能夠把深奥的學理作通俗的解釋者，乃是對於這學理最能有深刻的研究的人，顯然的，對於一種學理作精深刻苦的研究，能指使如意地應用的學者，我們還非常缺乏。</p>
<p>所以整個的說，問題還不在翻譯或編述，而在於學者研究學術的態度！</p>
<h3 id="c194">關於藍采和 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<p>前作藍采和非仙女辨一文，僅引陸游南唐書爲證。瑣事不足多辨，固是第一義。抑神仙之說，荒渺難稽，藍采和本身之有無尙成疑問，又何暇辨其爲男爲女乎？不必辨而亦辨之者·竊比於莊生以天下爲沈濁，不可與莊語之義，不謂痴人前說不得夢，竟引出胡懷琛之流許多妙論也。</p>
<p>趙翼陔餘叢考卷三十四，略謂世俗相傳八仙有女仙二人，藍采和，何仙姑。又謂元遺山有『自驚白　先潘岳，人笑藍衫似采和』之句。其題藍采和像云：『長板高歌本不狂，兒曹自爲百錢忙。幾時逢著藍衫老，同向春風舞一塲。』是藍采和乃男子也。今戲本硬差作女妝，尤可笑云云。趙翼已考出藍采和非女仙，今人編文藝辭典者不知。予爲指出，偏又有人代爲狺狺爭辨，吾末如如之何也已。</p>
<p>關於藍采和事，陔餘叢考有未備者，今爲補述一二。說郛卷四十三，唐沈汾續仙傳，列飛昇十六人，旁注『内女眞三人。』此三人列在最後，乃謝自然，裴玄靜，戚逍遙。至藍采和則列在十六人之第二，謂爲『不知何所人』。沈汾生於殘唐五代，尙不知藍采和爲何許人，然彼已肯定藍采和爲男仙，固章章然也。又查元明雜劇收入無名氏漢鍾離度藍采和一種，藍采和登塲白云：『小可姓許名堅，樂名藍采和，渾家是喜千金，所生一子是小采和，媳婦兒是藍山景。』自沈汾陸游以至元遺山等，皆云藍采和爲男仙，可知在五代宋元傳說中之藍采和猶非女仙也。趙翼謂世俗相傳藍采和爲女仙，又謂今戲本硬差作女妝，然則藍采和爲女仙之說，蓋明淸以來始有之歎　　　　　　　　先　作八仙　，藍采和在八仙中究竟爲男爲女，彼將有一解答，吾人俟之可也。</p>

<p>— 宜閑</p>
<p>她在南京和金陵大學農科農業經濟系主任敎授　凱（ＪｏｈｎＬｏｓｓｉｎｇＢｕｃｋ）結婚以後，生了一個女兒，相貎很好，可是生來就患着一種廢疾。賽女士只得把　送到美國一個專門敎養院去，讓她在那里過寂寞的一生。然而女士却常掛念着這可憐的女兒的前途。『我得給這女兒籌好一輩子的費用，纔安心呢！可是　凱先生敎書的收入很有限，我呢，又兩袖淸風，那兒來這許多錢呢？我想還是努力來著作，用著作上的進益來解决這個問題罷』。</p>
<p>這番坦率的話是賽女士對　的一估罷工朋友，那帮助她搜集中國小說史材料的龍墨薌君說的。</p>
<p>一九二七年春，寗案暴發，女士避難到上海，住在善鐘路旁一所小洋房衷，便在那里專心著作。她那最初問世的長篇小說，東風西風就是在那一年脫稿的。</p>
<p>次年春，時局安定，賽女士回到南京，　續從事於長篇創作。　每天淸晨起身，略略梳洗一番，便到三層樓上一個小房間裏，伏案寫作，早飯後再上樓去寫，直至中午停筆，午後方纔做其餘的事。在這樣的情形之下，就產生了後來轟動歐美文壇的大地。</p>
<p>東風西風以一個中國舊式女子桂蘭自叙的體裁描寫中國家庭中新舊恩想的衝突。憑了東方的情調和優美的文筆，這部小說出版後，獲得了英美各報的好評。可是那使她在美國文學界有了確定的聲譽，並且發了大財的作品却是大地。大地於一九三一年三月在紐約出版，便被美國出版界所組織的每月新書推選會選爲傑作。不久她又獲得了一九三一年的普利澤文學奬金。這奬金數目雖不過五千美金，可是在美國一向很有信譽，那光榮却是非常的。大地的結構以農人的生涯爲經，而以水旱兵匪的災禍爲緯。作者所抓住的，簡直是人貧困的中國目前最嚴重的幾個問題。主人公主龍可以算得佔着中國人口的最大多數的　民的　型　，其前半的　涯　表着　　　　的飢餓　貧農，後半則代表着生活優裕的富　。作者擺脫了『勤儉致富』這一種因　的道德觀念，偏以都市貧民的暴動作爲王龍一生的轉變點。這正是作者的偉的大的所在。也許因爲力求迎合美國的大衆趣味的緣故罷，作者對於中國駕禮敎却未免刻畫的太過分了，而且她對於崇拜着林黛玉式女性美的中國人的性心理描寫似乎也有幾分不自然。因此我國的諦者往往不大滿意於大地的後半部分。　　然而從批評的見地·大地的成坊顯然並不在於那些性愛的塲面。却在對於悲慘的饑民的動人的描寫。這樣的描寫窮苦的小說終於使作者在全世界不景氣的時代一躍而成爲富人了。這委實是出於作者意料之外的。作者現在無須憂慮到她那可憐的女兒一輩子的費用了，而且也同王龍將離南方大城市時的情形一樣，　然得到了多景的金洋，夠她作歐美長途的旅行，過日後豐裕的生活呢。</p>
<p>大地道小說多少轉變了歐美人對於我國的觀感，那實際的影響是値得注意的。一九三一年秋，正是大地在美國風行的時候，我國發生了嚴重的大水災。在政府所收到的從國外匯來的賑欵中，美國人所捐募的佔着大部分。那原因，據美國紅十字會會長寫給作者的信中所說，就白於三龍一家人遭遇旱荒的故事，深切地感動了美國人這緣故。</p>
<p>繼着大地而出版的是三子（Ｓｏｎｓ）。這描寫着王龍死後他那三個兒子的生活。他們三人就代表着中國的紳士，商人和軍閥。然而作者對於中國這類人物顯然沒有像她對於農民那樣的同情和認識，因而也就沒有大地那樣的成功。　　女士於一九三○年七月偕卜凱先生回美，親見了自己的作品在那里風行的盛况，今年六月下旬纔離開美國。現在她大約就在歐洲旅行的途中罷。在最近的將來，我們就可以見到這位以中國爲『第二母國』的幸福的女作家了。此番她再到中國來，對於這個又老大又貧困的中國，一定可以認識得更深切些，那麽她日後的作品也許會把大地的優點保持着，而把那缺點消除了的。我們在歐迎這位仁慈的作者的熱誠中，不禁還抱着這麽一點的希望。</p>

<p>（一）倫敦會議又失敗矣</p>
<p>一九三二年六月，洛桑會議，作復興世界經濟之企圖。七月九日成立五項恊定。其所成就已微，然猶未絶希望者，則第五項中，有國聯再行召集世界經濟會議是也。今年六月，此大規模之世界經濟會舉，舉行於倫敦，集六十六國之英彥，費三十八日之光陰，資本主義之金元王國，社會主義之赤色國際，以及平時不爲世界會議所顧者，居然亦被請入席，共冶一爐，泱泱哉盛會也。方期化人我之見，起不治之症。其無如予智自雄，鈎心鬥角，會議經過，荆棘横生。遂於本月二十七日宣告休會矣。結果如何　無庸贅述。會議重開，徒勞夢想。茲試就此次倫敦會議之重要議題，而一言其失敗情形，想亦讀者所關心也。</p>
<p>（一）關稅關稅戰爭，本爲經濟史上常見之名詞。而其範圍之廣大，程度之深刻，則無有如近數年來之甚者。關稅壁壘之建築，幾已無國無之。（關稅自主權殘缺的中國，當然不能一槪而論，）或謂現在各國關稅戰爭之法，自禁止輸入，限止輸入，增加關稅，奬勵輸出，互惠待，等普通戰略起，至國營貿易，國營匯兌等特殊戰略止，若細分之，可得二百餘種。當非虚語。各國對於輸出莫不求其增加，而對於輸入，又莫不求其减少。國際貿易塲中，頓生無數壁壘。國際貿易之指數，逐年减低，惟蘇聯爲其例外耳。於是各國乃大閙其物價低落問題；失業人數增加問題。經濟之恐慌，論者均歸因於關稅戰爭。而又無一國　首先撤去其壁壘，且又無一國不望他國之先行撤棄也。於是倫敦會議，盡注意於此。及至美國提普减關稅一成之議，而衆論譁然。以東洋德意志自命之日本帝國，尤爲反對。蓋各國之主撤棄關稅壁壘，類爲對他的，對於他國，所希望者寗止减少一成。而於本國則又以現有之壁壘，而最低之防線。於是關稅問題，祗得曳白而出矣。論者謂美之提議减稅，以其已新獲利器（金元跌價，）無須再全持關稅壁壘，以防止輸入也。法日等多數國家之反對普减，，則以美國正藉金元匯兌之猛跌，長足發展輸出，不可不藉關稅以抵制之。故法國每謂關稅之討論，當在匯兌問題解决以後。美旣不肯與聞匯兌安定政策，法日諸國，自亦不肯减低其關稅。各便其私，寗有解决之望。</p>
<p>（二）滙兌滙價之逸出常軌，由來已久。自各國紛紛禁止正金輸出　而其紊亂愈甚。所謂滙兌政策者，往往有不測之變化，國際投資及國際貿易，常受其掣肘，國際經濟，亦頓失其連鎖。論者每夢想戰前之繁榮，輒以爲滙兌市價之不穩，足以阻礙世界經濟之復與。然英日等國，自禁止正金輸出，貶落對外滙價之後，其商品之國際的市價，大見低落，對外貿易，不無得其助力。故對於滙兌心理，亦祗希望他國整理，而不願本國提高。正與關稅問題同一轍。自美國最近之經濟大恐慌，停止金本位，膨脹通貨，金元滙價，猛烈跌落，美貨之國際的市價，俄然大跌。其對外輸出，猶猛虎出押，所向無敵。各國乃自覺本國之滙兌政策，不足與美國抗，遂於倫敦會議提議安定之策，法國固其領袖也。但美方以此爲利器，豈肯放棄。於是所謂國際中央銀行制度者，國際滙兌基金制度者，滙價恊定者，均成空論。而滙兌問題，終歸泡影矣。白銀問題，乃滙兌問題中之一分目，亦倫敦會議中之重要問題也。當今用銀之國，如中國，印度，及其他多數弱國，藏銀均富。其人口之合計，與消費力之合計，皆甚可驚。徒以銀價之慘落，購買力不免不减。用金各國旣不得志於關稅問題及滙兌問題，乃退而就白銀問題，尋覓出路。衆意蓋以爲銀價如漲，則對於用銀國之輸出貿易，卽可發展，而世界經濟恐慌之原因，當可略有解决也。於是而白銀小組委員會議成立矣，八國恊定漸漸抬頭矣。用銀弱國，方幸各用金大國之紓尊降貴，恩賜掖援，而不知正爲用金國開拓輸出之地步也，悲夫。</p>
<p>（三）戰債戰債之支配，世界經濟霸權，蓋十數年矣。美國爲債權國，德國爲債務國，英國於美爲債務國，於他國爲債權國。法意比於德爲債權國，於美英則爲債務國。其債權債務相抵之結果，德國無論矣，若法若意，亦純爲債務國也。英則債權債務之居間國也。惟美國操絶大之債權，久握世界經濟之霸權。歐洲各國，幾無不仰其鼻息。自世界經濟一九二九年之恐慌，各國財政，日接　途。戰債云云，漸成爲可以重加修正之問題。而美國則正藉此稱霸世界，迄未許債權之剝削。一九三一年胡佛之緩付一年計劃滿期後，美國迭次催繳，而歐洲各債務國，則頗有難色。此次倫敦會議，乃首先提及戰　。此在　　　噶　　　　　　　　　而終未能忘情於修改　　　　　　　　　　也美國堅决反對，而倫敦會議中之戰債問題，如驚鴻之一瞥。</p>
<p>右之數者，已包括倫敦會議之重要議案，而幾可謂一無成就。此外如小麥恊定，效力至微；抑止投資之决議，等於虚文。限制生產，尤　空談，會議之爲失敗，無可疑也。而其失敗關鍵之在各國均思損人利己，卒至互相矛盾，以終於無成。</p>
<h3 id="c198">（二）經濟戰爭歟兵力囅爭歟 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>世界經濟會議之召集，非一次矣。一九二七年日内瓦之會，參加者五十國。當時對於關稅問題等，雖較有具體之决議。而閉會以後，關稅戰爭且益烈。此後多瑙河之會，洛桑之會，與會之國較少，其結果亦甚淺薄。近數月中，以美國之停止金本位，世界經濟益形不振。倫敦會議之不能盡如人意，原無足怪。然在開會前。各國究不無多少之期待。其政策之隱忍未發，以待會議中空氣之轉變者，蓋未嘗無之。今則會議以失敗終矣。多數國家，或鑒於他國之不肯讓步，或感於本國之種種落後，必且將抛棄其國際恊調之空想，自圖振作之道。則資本主義之猙獰面目，必日益暴露，而下列三項，不免爲其必走之路徑矣。</p>
<p>（一）統制經濟之拾頭蘇聯自五年計劃成功，雖舉世咸感經濟之恐慌，而獨能發展生產，增進輸出。於是與共產主義對抗之各資本主義國，亦隨之高唱經濟統制論。其意以爲資本主義過去之發展，以生產合理化爲極則。而於全國之經濟事業，却無統盤之籌劃。以致每個生產事業愈合理化，而全國經濟愈不合理。故當重整全國之陣線，以求經濟之統制。自生產事業以至全國之貿易及金融，均應受政府之統制。此種政策，實卽國家資本主義耳。歐美各國，已有採用其一部份者，如匯兌管理是也。此次倫敦會議旣失敗，國際間之情勢，益見緊張。其國家的統制之範圍，自有擴大之可能。</p>
<p>（二）貿易金融之再戰近數年來之關稅戰爭，滙兌戰爭，以及傾銷政策，正金爭奪政策等，皆關於貿易及金融之戰爭也。而關稅實爲貿易戰爭之重心，滙兌又爲金融戰爭之重心。故倫敦會議首先及此。今會議旣失敗，國際間對抗之勢益著。世界之貿易及金融，明明已失其連鎖。各國在貿易上殆無不感覺生產之過剩，物價之過小，而有力謀出超之必要。在金融上又均思力求正金之儲藏，以謀本國信用制度之起色。關稅與滙兌戰爭之再接再厲，已具必然之勢。而國際間之全般貿易關係及金融關係，或不免盡入戰爭狀態也。在經濟統制思想抬頭時代，此種戰爭，最屬可能。</p>
<p>（三）市場之爭奪近年各國之所患者，不在生產之不足。而在銷路之狹小。倫敦會議之最要目的，蓋卽在掃除國際貿易之障碍，以活動貿易也。不幸因各國之互相不肯讓步，各種障碍毫未减少。且會議之結果旣不良，今後愈將發生新障碍。各國於失望之餘，自必進而爲市場之爭奪，以謀經濟上之新殖民地。或排除他國之競爭，以謀原有市場之獨占。在經濟統制及貿易金融戰爭之時代，此種爭奪，必不可免。其結果或將引起兵力戰爭。而世界第二次大戰之導火線卽種於此矣。</p>
<p>右之三項，復可歸納其背景爲二。（一）國家資本主義之發展，···凡全國經濟之統制，貿易金融之對外侵略，經濟殖民地之爭奪等，皆國家資本主義之特色也。近年蘇聯所爲，何嘗不如是，其國内雖號稱共產，而在世界經濟之立塲上，固一國家資本主義之國也。因各國之國家資本主義，尙未完成，故蘇聯在世界經濟之戰塲中，得占優勢。今者各國雖忌言共產，而已羣同此道進展矣。在此後之進展過程中，國家主義愈發達者，當占優勢，世界經濟，有局部繁榮之可能。但積日漸久，國際經濟必均爲此等國家所塡滿，而感受發展餘地之不足。則每個國家之經濟，雖臻合理化（？）而全世界之經濟，必有感受不合理之一日。則經濟之恐慌，終不免汎濫而不可收拾也。經濟學家，每謂資本主義雖發達，必有自行爆滅之一日，此蓋學理研究上所得之共同結論也。（二）國際對抗太陣線之形成；···國際對抗之局，當因倫敦會議之不恊調而增烈。其利害相同者，不免互爲結合，以對抗其共同之敵國。歐洲蓋早已有此局面矣。國際對抗陣線之化零爲整，由薄增厚，殆爲無可疑者。凡貿易上互惠，金融上之同盟，均其必然之趨勢也。且戰債問題，糾紛多年。此次會議中美國之態度，尤爲歐洲各國所側目而莫可如何。則今後因經濟覇權之爭奪，戰債利害之分别，國際經濟上之對抗大陣綫，愈將顯著形成。其結果不免引起兵力戰爭，更　諱言。</p>
<p>總之，今後各國，必沒落於國家資本主義之戰爭而不自覺。卽號稱共產主義之蘇俄，亦不能外此。蓋各國之於本國之經濟政策，雖將日謀　頓，而　所指之方向已誤，沒落不過時日問題耳。其間必不免浪費許多天然物質，紡碍許多人類生活。西方人每　造物主宰，自有上帝；則上帝　愚矣哉。</p>
<h3 id="c199">（三）不患貧而患不均 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>由倫敦世界經濟會議之前後，以探討各國之經濟政策，旣覺其猙獰可怖，又惜其昏愚可憐。吾　書生之見，以爲改轅易轍，尙有道也。請申論之；</p>
<p>世人動言經濟恐慌，以爲形勢岌岌，不可終日。但吾人試一憸物質之供給，尙敷人類生活上之需要否？據世界統計，一九二五年較一九三一年全世界人口物質之增加率如左。</p>
<p>人口五％原料品二五％</p>
<p>食料品一○％</p>
<p>可見人類生活，本不致發生貧乏，又何有乎恐慌。此正所謂生之者衆，食之者寡也。自馬爾薩斯人口論出，世人或恐人口眞爲幾何級數之增加，物質僅爲算衛式的增加。繼證之工業革命後之生產力，乃覺其爲杞人憂天。今者物品之增加，明明過於人口。而各國則一面大聲疾呼，申訴經濟之恐慌，失業之衆多與貧乏。一面又操管拂紙，記錄其存貨之增加率，物價之低落綫，與夫生產之人爲的抑止方法，其可奇不更甚乎？夫物質未嘗不足，而大部份之人口，則感消費不足，失業者至無以爲生。資本家之躉積存貨者，則多嘆原生產力之過大，銀根之不足周轉。甚且毁棄其部份之貨物，以防止跌價。於是有因銷貨之呆滯，引起物價之跌落，及遲不還欠欵者矣。有因信用之崩壞，牽動金融界者矣。有因對外輸出之助長，輸入之限制，而引起關稅問題者矣。有因貿易金融之不穩，而引起匯兌問題者矣。有因限制生產或企業失敗，而引起失業矣，有因國　　濟之表落，而引起財政上之缺陷者矣。有因財政上之缺陷，或市塲金融之不　，而引起通貨膨脹者矣。又有因通貨膨脹，而引超國際滙兌金融。及貿易上之糾紛者矣。近年之新　世界經濟恐慌者，其因果當不外是也。其結　之所在，纯爲分配不均。惟分配不均，而資本家祗着眼於剩餘價値，於是生產有所謂過大。又惟分配不均，而勞動者及一般中下級無餘裕之購買力，於是物質有所謂過剩。大學曰，不患貧而患不均。世界經濟之病態，可作如是觀。　　夫旣病在『不均』，則當以『均』治之。故苟欲挽救世界經濟之刧運，惟當以經濟上之生產與分配，由社會管理之。使人盡其力，貨盡其用。傾軋爭奪，無從居其利。而資本主義之猙獰面目，不去自去。吾　書生之見，以爲各國應幡然覺悟，而向此途進展也。</p>
<p>抑猶有進者，各國財政之缺陷，亦爲促成經濟恐慌之一因。其膨脹通貨無論矣。卽如關</p>
<p>稅之提高，亦有出於財政作用者。而財政之有</p>
<p>缺陷，則　武主義實爲主因。戰債尙其小焉者也。據國聯之調查，歐洲各基督敎國之預算，有百分之七十，花費於已往及未來之費用。一九三零年英國財政大臣，亦謂全世界之軍備費，年達九萬萬金鎊。　武主義之直接有妨於經濟者已如是。而間接之妨害，尤必可驚。故吾人之意，以爲各國尤應立刻改變其政策，則其至小之效果，亦可防止經濟之再趨晦暗。然在各國私心自用之際，正欲以武力爲其經濟戰爭之後盾，政策未改變之前。此層决難辦到。則正本淸源，仍當以上述之經濟改方在日謀擴張之不暇，何有减縮之可能。此軍縮會議所以迄無成就，世界刼運終難銷弭也。</p>
<h3 id="c200">經濟會議失敗之主因楚 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>自六月十二日，倫敦世界經濟會議開會，迄今一月有餘，難收預期之效果，不待至今日而始知也。如今經濟會議竟以失敗告矣。其失敗之原因正多，而其最大之原因，會議之目的，非單純的經濟問題，而雜有政治的作用在焉。當會議之初，英相麥唐納冒稱提出政治方面之戰債問題，雖此問題，未列議題，然未幾法國又提出對於會議關係愈爲重大之歐洲政局安安問題；與羅斯福大總統提出之非侵略條約問題；德代表提出之舊德領殖民地之收回問題等頓使會議形勢忽然變化。將英德法意之四國恊定爲楔子，安定歐洲政局與求改訂和平條約之德意比等國，竟與法波蘭小恊商國之意見相對立。蓋四國恊定爲楔子之責任國，原在小恊商國。而小國中之捷克斯拉夫外交總長皮尼秀，對於四國恊定，反對最力。良以德國以絶端的國家主義相標榜，欲以實力恢復國力。一方排斥猶太人，他方實行政黨單獨化，皆爲遂行遠大目的之表現。在此不安定的情勢，而欲安定歐洲政局爲前提之經濟會議之成功，其可能乎？原失之歐洲政局不安者，卽因軍縮會議之失敗，軍縮會議失敗，卽發生經濟會議之大障碍。於是各國皆以利己的立塲，形成經濟同盟以自固。如英國與加拿大，澳洲，印度，南阿非利加，羅台西亞以及其他自治領植民地等之聯合；法國與法領印度支那，亞爾塞里亞並與有密切關係之波蘭，捷克，羅馬尼亞，巨哥斯拉夫，以及其他植民地間之聯合；美國與亞爾善丁，巴西哥倫比亞等南美諸國之聯合；德國與意，奥，匈之聯合，如此聯合同盟之對立；皆以經濟的國家主義，採取排外的政策。美國之通貨膨脹！提高物價，與法國之安定通貨，以統制生產兩大主張，卽爲此次會議失敗之重大原因，故吾人苟欲眞正的挽救世界經濟之窮况，須先將此種聯合統制取銷。否則，各　極端，蔑視國際恊調，急於經濟的國家主義，則世界經濟之前途，更不堪設想矣。良以經濟的聯合後，各國間必設定特惠關稅，或恊定互惠關稅，或對於第三國提高關稅，制限輸入，傾力於市塲競爭，果爾世界金融必愈陷於混辭之狀，各國產業經濟，將日形萎　不振者也。</p>

<p>（一）拆息分爲現金（卽現洋）與轉帳（卽支票）　　二種，手續費每千元徴收五分。</p>
<p>（二）匯兌分天津上海兩處，手續費每千元亦徴收五分。</p>
<p>（三）貨幣分上海鈔票，山西鈔票，及其他鈔票三種，手續費每千元徴收五分。此外北平市有一個證券交易所，成立於民國七年，資本六十萬元，除負賣公債庫券外，公司股票，祇有啟新一家。營業公民國十三，十四，十五，三年爲最盛，買賣以現貨爲多。交易則爲相對交易，非競爭交易。交易時間，在每日上午十二時後。交易所對於買賣兩方面，均負完全監督的責任，如果有一方面違約，則對方面所受的損失，可由交易所担任賠償，而交易所方面再向違約人追償一切的損失。證券交易每萬元須四百元現金保證金，手續費則買賣兩方面各微收五角，以五千元之票面計算。經紀人名額爲六十人，每人要有現金五千元的保證金，並由經紀人公會會員二人以上的介紹，待審查合格後，再呈請實業部加以核定，然後方予認可。此項經紀人大都以銀號爲多，而是兼營此業者。現在該交易所的經紀人祗剩十餘名，想係市塲衰落的緣故。至北平當地的金融問題，卽屬銅元問題，近年來因爲外來的銅元甚多，大都來自天津，故當局加以禁止，蓋如果銅元充斥於市塲，則一般小本經營的入，以及勞動的苦力，必首蒙其害。以次影響於社會甚鉅。至於廢兩改元問題，平地無形中早已實行廢兩改元，現在各項買賣均無銀兩的單位，此或許是平地無外匯的牽制罷！</p>
<p>五公用事業及勞資間的問題北平的電車公司是官商合辦的，官股由中法銀行塡欵，市中電車走的路線不多，車身均屬陳舊，不過搭客倒甚擁擠，想來其營業收入是不錯的，電車上開車時的聲號，是用警笛來吹的，這與市中發生驚慌時所用的警笛相同，我看有些不妥麽？電燈自來水等則完全商辦，政府不過處於監督的地位。這些公用事業的規模如何？設備如何？因爲未曾去參觀過，所以不能加以揣測和批評。但從平地自來水用户方面調查，該自來水公所放送的水甚爲不潔，水内黃泥甚多，必須先貯在缸中，經過沉澱的功夫，才能應用，這也是公用事業應當改良的地方。至於北平因爲缺少大公廠的緣故，勞資間的問題，甚少發生，有組織的不過電車工會與郵政工會。偶有爭議發生，大都能和平解决，可說平地近年來眞正的工潮是沒有的。</p>
<p>六生活程度的槪觀丨丨結語</p>
<p>北平因爲遷都的關係，一般生活程度不知降低了許多，不看别的，祗以房租一項而論，以前是因爲政治中心的關係，追逐於官塲的人們多，所以住處求過於供，房租可以儘量的增加，但是以後因爲政治中心遷移南下，一般官　中的人物，隨之而行，因此住處頓形供過於求，房租隨之跌落了不知多少。住房旣不値錢，地價亦隨之跌落了，而地價的跌落，益使房租减價，招攬到現在平地住屋租金每間每月最多不過一元，尙慮無主顧。自九一八事變發生後，東北居民絡繹避入關内，平地因之增加居民不少，換言之，對於住處的需要方面，亦可以增加不少，不過說到此點，有件趣事不妨一提，就是平地的一般屋主，倒不甚歡迎東北居一付，租下住了之後，是永久不會再付租金的，房東亦屬無法可想。雖然，關於此點，亦有得討論的地方，因爲一般東北居民旣失却了他們的房產和田地，是流離失所的災民，應如何的加以救濟，不過此必須有政府救濟的具體辦法，否則徒任他們妨碍當地社會的秩序，其過失乃在於當局了。此外可以舉例說明者，卽爲一般洋車車夫的生活，先以上海而言，此輩舉足疾行，汁流浹背，因生活程度的高昻，勞動終日，甚或不得一飽。北平則不然，此輩車夫，我們腦經中所深留的印象，大都是衣服整齊，車身漂亮，他們的車子，有的是自備的，有的是租自他人的，租金最多每日不過二三角錢，少的祗要銅元五六十枚就夠，所以他們每天祗要賺得五六角的話，就可以安適的度日了。在上面亦曾說過北平工人的工資，普通每月亦不過五六塊錢，此與上海比較起來，眞有天壤之别了。最後總括的一句話，我國旣有如許不値錢的人工，而不利用之以發展，我國的工業，覺得大可惜呢！（完）</p>

<h3 id="c208">談狗 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>就一般的定性而言，狗大抵是一種最忠實的動物；就是忠實於豢養牠的主人；同時，因爲忠實有某種必然的好處，所以狗就爲一般人所愛於家豢養。　　但中國人對於狗，素來不很看重，所以國難雖然怎樣嚴重，各種的救國運動都有，惟獨關於狗的還不曾出現，只微聞『賽狗』生意甚好。</p>
<p>就是對狗的待遇，也非常微薄，鄕下狗，其唯一果腹品是人們的屎，有時甚至連尿也沒有吃得，因爲屎在鄕下不比城裏的賤，是農作上獨一的肥料，於是狗要吃，便只有偷，拔門爬缸的偷，如果是偷本主人家的倒還不打緊，若偷别人家的，那就有遭打的危險。至於餵飯，餵好飲食，以及起居都很舒服，那是中國狗命裏絶沒有的福緣。</p>
<p>生長在城裏的也沒有什麽好，只是牠們大率都不願吃屎。</p>
<p>所以中國國狗，狗就是一隻狗，不然奇。</p>
<p>若說到洋狗，那就費詞了，光是名號就多着，警狗，哈叭狗，獅子狗，還有專爲牠起名的，總之是不一而足。而其所吃的東西更是優美，據說有種狗，專門吃牛肉，有種狗却喜愛牛奶或牛油麵包。不但吃得好，而且還有其他優待之處，簡直人都不如牠，比如洋狗就不愛走路，要和人一樣坐汽車，天冷了，也很怕冷，要圍爐，要披衣，這等事皆使人看着刺眼。尤其像年紀輕輕的洋婆，愛牽帶一頭牡狗，最爲中國人所不取，所以北平曾有過一道命令，禁止婦女學洋婆牽牡狗在街上走，說是有關風化。</p>
<p>然而狗的忠實性，初無畛域之分，中狗洋狗，盡皆同然。</p>
<p>小時候，讀過不少關於『義犬』的文章，這義字就是登峯造極的忠實。事實</p>
<p>大抵是這樣；『某甲家畜一犬，某日挈往某處，途次忽遇猛獸，獸撲人，犬護之，得免於危。』作者便借以喻人警世，輒如此而結尾曰；『嗚呼，可以人而不如犬乎！』或『噫，獸尙如此，人何可堪！』此種狗是狗的忠實楷模，簡直可以爲人師表。從這裏却又可見中國人之重視狗處，那就是重視牠那麽忠實。　　其後自己敎小學時，採用的國語課本，開篇便是；『狗，大狗，小狗，大狗呌，小狗跳，呌一呌，跳一跳，哥哥做狗···』狗哥哥狗弟弟，一直狗下去，當時我很奇怪，以這種知識敎示小孩，眞難免不使他們學像一隻搖尾狗。　　其後輟敎來滬求學，更深得了一層狗的意義，閱書看報，常見有『走狗』其名，那是說某爲某奴役豢養，好像人家蓄的一頭狗。有次學校裏鬧風潮，壁報上的文字全是『狗戰』，這派駡那派的人是某某的走狗，那派又駡這派的人是誰的義犬，至此完全證明，當今之世，有走狗其人矣。</p>
<p>洎至走入社會之門，『走狗』，『哈叭狗同志』的名詞與事實，更是隨時隨地聽到見到。</p>
<p>現在果眞是狗的世界了，大槪能『走』能『狗』的人，都有一點辦法，否則就難保肚皮不起恐慌。</p>
<p>然狗也有例外的反忠實，比如『癲狗』『瘋狗』，就簡直不認得主人，『走狗』中當也有這一種，不過究竟是例外是少數。</p>
<h3 id="c209">恭喜『發財』！ <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>哈哈！先生·太太少爺·小姐！</p>
<p>終於到啦！哈哈，今天是；『七月三十一日』啦！</p>
<p>哈哈！先生，太太，少爺，小姐！</p>
<p>『七月三十日』的日歷已經撕掉啦，今天千眞萬確，是『七月三十一日』啦！</p>
<p>哈哈！先生，太太，少爺，小姐！『七月三十一日』啦，『發財』啦！哈哈！</p>
<p>哈哈！</p>
<p>喔唷！先生，太太，少爺，小姐！我笑了這麽多的『哈哈』，我肚子可眞眞笑得痛不過啦！</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我報告你：『發財票』開彩的地方就在那逸園啦，那就是我家廟東十來步路的那跑狗塲逸園啦。</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我再報告你，『發財票』開彩的時候就在喫過晝飯一點鐘啦！我勸你們晝飯以早喫爲妙，不喫亦佳，否則，那裏是『水洩不通』，你可難得擠進去啦！</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我再告訴你，今天還只是『發財』的預告啦『亮晶晶的洋鈿』或『香噴噴的支票』還要等到下個月七號啦。</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，所以我要問你，你可讀過三民主義沒有？如果沒有，我再告訴你，三民主義第一講裏有一個有趣的故事，就是說有一個脚夫買了『發財票』，他把彩票放在扁担的個</p>
<p>中，後來他果然中了頭奬，他眞有趣極啦，他再不要這扁担了，就把牠丢在江中，這麽着，他就沒得『發財』啦，所以你們今天即使『中了彩』，請你千萬不要把這『發財票』丢了，否則，你可要像三民主義裏的『那個』一樣『沒得』啦！</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我再告訴你，今天到逸園去的時候，你可千萬不要冾！抵抚！和平解决</p>
<p>前後判若兩人希遠</p>
<p>不要忘帶『老虎人丹』，『八卦丹』，『萬應油』····啊，否則，這麽熱的天氣，這麽烈的『太陽』，這麽多的『人氣』，以及這麽沸騰着的一股『熱血刮心』氣，你『千金之驅』可要當不住啊，『當不住』之後即使你中了頭彩又豈不是那個？</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我奉勸你，萬一你在逸園眼睜睜的望了一會，望不到你自己『發財票』的號碼的時候，（恕我說句不吉利的話）你千萬不要灰心，因爲據說這種『發財票』還有『再接再厲』的『第二期』，所以你也可『再接再厲』去預備好『起碼』十元大洋，那你第一次的『失望』就有了又一次『熱望』來代替，你的心就不會『灰』了·（至於這傳說確否待證）</p>
<p>先生，太太，少爺，小姐，如果你眞的沒有中頭彩而同時又不想『再接再厲』而眞的『灰心』非凡的時候，那我奉勸你去看看，魯迅的『阿Ｑ少傳』，便可解『灰』，阿Ｑ常給人家打駡，以後自言自語道：『這小子好無禮，又打了老子也』！你也可作如是想：『這····又騙了老子十元元也！』那末，你就可釋然了。</p>
<p>自然囉，哈哈，先生，太太，少爺，小姐，我是希望你們個個中頭彩的。希望你們個個熱望滿腔的去看開彩，個個熱血沸騰的回到家門，將來又是個個熱涙迸流的去『捧黃金』或『領支票』。哈</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>哈，總之，恭喜『發財』！</p>
<p>哈哈，先生，哈哈太太，哈哈少爺，哈哈小姐，哈···哈···哈···哈！喔唷，不知怎的又笑起來了，哈···哈···哈···哈</p>
<p>，我的肚子又笑痛啦！</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>霓虹燈的媚眼下，送進一羣年靑人，穿白衣的待役早在樓頭灣着腰裝滿了笑臉歡迎。冲進小小的餐室後，電扇就狂馳起來，每個人還不住地喊着熱，待者識趣的送上幾瓶汽水，手儘是抓住了搶奪，這時整個的房内，騷擾，紛亂。年靑人不肯放過每個所以混閙的機會，聚餐會當然是很好的Chaoce</p>
<p>八個人團團坐滿一桌，待者的素肴搬上來後，並不虚僞的喊『請』，十八隻筷早不約而同的總動員，無論是整個的魚，肉，都變了他們的俘虜。遲一點下手的往往被筷頭上夾着最大一塊的取笑，而旁座的一定也碰上他的肩胛，使他的俘虜品掉到桌上，再供大家一度爭搶。所以他們聚餐會的組織，聯絡感情，砌磋學識等都是對外的宣傳，本身無非抓住一個Chance胡閙一陣而已。</p>
<p>天氣是這樣地熱，每天去坐寫字間，眞是受罪的事，但是對於聚餐會沒有一個缺席。年歲較大的會長上回曾提議停止舉行一次，就被六個以上的會員反對；致於會長僅僅是年歲較大一點，並沒有眞眞的上了年紀，凑趣胡閙，當然也能儘量敵迎。</p>
<p>桌上僅有幾個所謂大菜了，各人的胃部似乎也應該休息一下，於是花樣就在這時候翻新，呌堂唱是聚餐會上每一回要實行的節目。各人會意的通過後，就有臨時書記正筆直書，他不會記錯某人呌玲瓏，某人呌月英。等役者將局票送出之後，暫時散席，二個一組，三個一堆，各自討論，有聲電影，女人的故事，或在甚至更穢　的把戲，聚餐會對於年靑人確是很好的集合。</p>
<p>一陣高跟皮鞋聲從甬道中送來，姑娘們都是那樣美麗，輕盈，小小的餐室中頓時充滿了靑春活躍的空氣。每一個聚餐會的會員擁了自己的相好，躺在沙發上，靠在凉台上，不規則的謔語，不規則的舉動，使得始娘們像觸了電似的笑起來；而這顫動的笑聲，正是對方認爲樂趣的。</p>
<p>人們已忘了這是酷熱的夏，像跌進了春的蕩漾底氣息中一樣。姑娘們的紅唇，半腴的綫條，在薄質的旗衫中沉醉了八個年靑人的靈魂。四碗大菜在桌的中央偷窺他們的醜態，僥倖自己沒有被爲俘　　　　　　　　　較大的會長已付淸　賬　，他們計議着向另一個不夜天的世　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　蜂窠似的擁出菜館，馬路上的汽車，裝滿了兜風的人，水電燈的包車來往交熾着，上海的不夜天正在這時候開始；不論是酷熱的夏天，都像沉醉的春季一樣。</p>
<p>七層樓的洋房轟在眼前，每一個窗口都有燈光映射出來；汽車，包車，在開口等候牠們的主人完成某一件要務。八個年靑人被夏天裏的春天呑噬了。</p>
<h3 id="c212">廣東深圳之大賭場 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 梁鳳</p>
<p>一般闊人的豪賭生活</p>
<p>粤人好賭，上至通都大邑，下至鄕鎭小市，滿坑滿谷，都是賭塲，凡是到過廣東的人，沒有不知道的。這中間，廣東的老百姓，不知被那些賭塲主及當地政府剝去多少血汗呢。這也不過就廣東社會一種普遍現象而言。在廣九鐵路的旁邊有個地名呌做深圳，那眞是有一無二之大賭塲了。在這個賭塲裏，架有很高大的賭壇，有戲台，有酒館，有唱脚（即歌女），有女招待，總之一切闊人</p>
<p>足以享樂的生活，應有盡有了。原來這個賭塲的雇客，多數是一些富商，政客，軍人，地主。他們即以其地爲消遣塲，一擲萬金，都算不得什麽一回事的。從香港搭車到深圳，只消一個鐘頭，即可抵達。我曾跟着一個軍官，一臨其地。裏面設有許多賭台，什麽輪盤大賭，翻攤，體子，眞是五光十色，樣樣俱全。賭客下注，起碼要一塊錢，但是每日的盈輸，動以萬計的。這些賭客，有六七十歲的老翁，有雄糾糾的中年軍官，有十七·八歲的靑年，有肥胖的中年太太，有極摩登的少女，有些成日成夜都在那裏過活，餓了由賭塲主供給美餐，倦了就在那裏睡覺，喜歡抽鴉片的，有着女招待來陪裝，喜歡椎骨的，也有着僱來的少女替他椎。所以，他們眞是流連忘返，渺不在乎輸盈了。尤其令我注目的，是那些闊人的太太姨太太之流，她們賭得更豪，動以千萬元下注。我曾見着一位十八·九歲的少婦（聽說是廣東某要人的第六位妾氏），身上絲光翠映，指間套着三四個耀目的鑽戒，身邊帶來二·三萬鈔洋，一塲便輸光了，即將指上的戒指押作數千元下注，一霎間又輸下了，她却態度從容，一笑作罷。那種情形，眞令我們一般窮小子見之要退避三舍了。你想這些政客闊人們，從何處得來這般巨欵以供她們揮霍，還不是向我們的小百姓身上盡量來抽剝嗎？吁！</p>
<h3 id="c213">她倆的苦衷 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>

<p>當這女權開始在社會上掙到一部份相當地位的時候！的確是我們大中華民國　　　來的　　　　因此一　有血性的靑年女子們無一個不拚命的爭扎着。預備着丨丨將來能在社會上達到進一份責任；退一步講解决本身的飯碗問題。但在這萬事不景氣的年頭，能夠站在『奮鬥』的戰線上來勇敢的競爭丨是値得我們欽佩的；可是不幸的女子們走過了社會！其困難眞比男子多些，不見得完全爲他們的知識幼稚意，志薄弱等等而失敗。據我很好的兩位朋友告訴過我一她們的苦衷』後：我更十二萬分的同情，决無一點不相信他們的話了。</p>
<p>A告訴我她的事實是這樣：</p>
<p>『一般男子都駡我們是花瓶，祇是陳設着好看，絲毫沒有生產做事的能力，XX許多不耐人聽的話，那知拚命的好容易掙到一碗飯吃吃；在郵局裏當一個郵務員，偏偏這裏支局祗我一個是女性，其餘通統都是男子。在這種環境當中，不做一聲，未免過於寂寞；但也不能一天到晚不開一次口，所以有時隨意和他們談幾句，誰知他們就起一種詭心，不知想到什麽地方去？天天來和我嚕囌些什麽？萬一被上面的人注意：他就有『品性不端』的頭銜贈你，假使賭氣不和他們談話，他們就說是『眼高』，『搭架子』這類的話；然而上級的人，有許多事又不能不和他商議，領導，因此他們就借故着說：『定是和他有什麽苟且』丨像這樣連口都不能開，過去找是非，轉來立不住足，對上級的人難！對同時辦事的人更難了！』·····？</p>
<p>Q是某某管理科的一人位女職員，她任抄錄的工作，她說；</p>
<p>『我們管理科有三個女錄事，（他是其中一個）照例每月每人都要請假三天，假條是由書記長轉呈科長核准的；這</p>
<p>次新來這位科長，聽說他是將從日本回國的洋舉人，他上辦公廳沒有幾天就下個條子式的命令；『以後本科職員，在此加緊工作時期，不許擅再請假，縱有特别情事，亦須呈明理由俾資考核等語』。我雖也看到他的命令：但這是沒有法子的事，我公然照舊爲寫『因病乞假三天』的條子，托一位女同事帶去。軍事機關的命令當然比其他行政機關來得　重！不幸的我，三天後仍去辦法；他丨丨科長，就追究我『爲什麽違令』？同時回我『有什麽病』？當着辦公廳裏有許多人，把我嚴厲的質問····終於答應他『肚子痛』！他接着就駡：『肚子痛都要請三天假嗎』？</p>
<p>第二天早晨；就下了一道命令；『十四，管理科准尉錄事XXX，行爲不軌，性情懶惰；該科科長XX呈請着予革職，照准』。</p>
<p>我看見這行油印字跡，馬上身子就軟了下去！氣都嘆不出口，同事們一個個顯着輕視的態度來着；已走進辦公廳的我，從又站起來，提着皮包離開這纔坐了不上半年的寫字桌。唉！</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>李石喬聽到這句話慚愧得心裏發抖，祗得順便問道：</p>
<p>『你怎樣曉得？』</p>
<p>『這裏前綫上，也每天進來有報的。這一次總算民心一致了，我看報上，這次抵制仇貨總算不假的實行了的！』</p>
<p>『後方民心不一致，怎對得住前綫上的將士？』事實上是李石喬不這樣說謊，怎足以安慰周紹平。他跟在紹平的後面，眼睛注視着脚前的細草，手反在後面自己捻着，這好像是電影中的特寫，表示這捻着的手的主人正埋在深思的煩惱裏。紹平在前面走着，步武很是嚴正，但有時路上遇着石塊，便踼球似把那石塊翻過至少三十咪達。他忽然回轉面，很担心的問道：</p>
<p>『張洪烈怎樣了？我因爲在前線不能去看他！』一時得不到石喬什麽回答，祗得搖搖頭道；『可惜他不能到前綫來，凡是和　敵人衝鋒過的人，决不會再否認民族意識的，然而他旣然被下獄了丨被自己的同胞捕下獄，無非更事實地證明階級意識的存在與强化，而且劃開了民族意識的藩籬。我覺得，凡是沒有民族情緖的人，我們正要請他到最前綫，讓敵人的飛機，大砲來告訴他一切。』李石喬是一個素來歡喜說理論的人，所以他總是熱中於辦刋物，起計劃等興趣。可是當他聽了周紹平這一番話後，他覺得，理論如果是文字的表現，那是何等空虚而貧弱的啊！强狀的理論便是勇敢的行動，行動的本身便是最有力的理論，他那怕寫過十多萬字的論文，可曾說過一段像周紹平這樣切中的話麽？他爲紹平所感動，一言不語地跟到了戰壕邊。壕上的警戒兵要他們跳到戰壕裏去說話，石喬一跳進壕裏便聞到一陣泥土氣，混雜着薫人的汗臭。但壕裏的士兵們忽然看見便衣的石喬，更加以紹平介紹說是代表ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會來慰勞前方將士的，大家便像見了自己的親人一樣地微笑着，有的走向前來和他握手，有的來探問後方的情形，戰壕裏頓時充滿了柔和的氛圍，天上，綿軟的白雲，夢似的浮游過來，人生是多麽可迷戀，可讚賞的啊。於是，那些有家室的將士們，不禁眉宇問卦上一層追懷的柔縐了。</p>
<p>但是白雲的後邊，不近人情地追踪着幾隻灰翼紅圈的敵機，大槪是來搜索我軍主力部隊之所在。</p>
<p>隨即，前哨的潛伏偵探歸還報告，情况是：『敵人約二三千，重砲一大隊，隨着飛機掩護，沿粤秀路朝東奔來，先頭已到達前上海大學舊址。</p>
<p>『去那媽！』戰壕裏大家把武裝帶束緊起來。</p>
<p>敵機在上空旋了一個圓圈很迅速地又退了回去。</p>

<h3 id="c215">演員們自虐的防止 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 引西</p>
<p>禽獸尙有團體加以保護　　相形見絀可歎人不如犬影片裏加入表演的禽獸，牠們都有人道主義的團體，想得着去保護牠們，但是演員們貴爲人類，反倒沒有人體恤他們而加以保護了。現在雖然一時難於斷定所謂，殘虐的，在這般明星們身上，究竟係什麽；然而有許多顯然的慘無人道的事情，卽使明星們自己情願忍受，我想亦應當有人出來主張爲人道計，應當加以禁絶或限制吧！</p>
<p>聽說在『萬花獻媚』（ＴｈｅＫｉｄｆｒｏｍＳｐａｉｎ）片子裏，有幾幕鬥牛的表演。每天拍演的時候，各慈善機關都派了男女代表到塲監督着。他們從早坐到晚，惟恐那些從墨西哥運來的，寳貝的牛受什麽虐待損害。他們差不多每逢到幕序裏有用到禽獸的地方，就先顧慮到人道主義，要使恩澤及於禽獸。但是做演員的人呢？他們就想不到了！</p>
<p>但是人亦至少應當有些保障吧。難道他們還不如一條狗，一隻貓，一頭牛嗎？所以頂好將來能夠有人出來，仿造那保護禽獸的辦法，組織一個『電影演員虐待防止會。大槪這個會是社會上所急需的吧。</p>
<p>米曲羅公司裏，有一天夏天拍一齣狗戱。因爲天氣熱，所以特别用了人工冷氣，用大風扇在攝影塲裏搧着。這樣狗是很舒服了，因爲這是禽獸虐待防止會所主張的。但是瓊克勞馥演處的時候，天氣照樣的熱，而她却沒有冷氣的享受。有人說，瓊克勞馥就是受些熱，亦不至於伸着舌頭喘氣。倘使她要伸着舌頭喘氣，那公司方面一定替她預備冷氣了。這雖是一個笑話，但至少亦可以證明人的享受，有時還不如一條狗呢！</p>
<p>有一天有一位記者去訪問一位女明星呌凱倫慕萊的。那時凱倫慕萊同時拍着三張片子，忙得不得了。凱倫慕萊的身體，近年來亦遠不如從前了。這大槪係神經身體雙方勞苦過度的緣故吧。那女記者進屋的時候，有一個醫生手裏拿了一支大號的注射針，將一種興奮劑打到凱倫慕萊的皮裏去了。凱倫慕萊立卽暈了過去，如死的樣。那位女記者嚇得什麽似的，連忙去找了一杯冷水。但她不知道還是潑在凱倫慕萊臉上的好呢，還是灌進她嘴裏的好呢。正在這遲疑不决的一回兒凱倫慕萊忽然地醒了，當然面容上透出不少的痛苦和憔悴，但是她還不得不立卽站了起來去工作。</p>
<p>郎却耐爲藝術而犧牲的事，大家都知道吧。現在他的步後塵的鮑列斯卡洛夫所拍的片子如ＴｂｅＭｕｍｍｙ之類都是於精神身體，有絶大影響的。他的化裝，須二小時纔能完畢，要一小時纔能去掉。所用的蠟，松香，油漆等類的東西，使他的皮膚非但斷絶呼吸，並且加以緊縮。這統通是於他的壽命有妨害的。但是鮑列斯貪了明星二字的好聽，以及幾千元一星期的薪水；就不顧一切了。其他諸如此類的事情很多，難道不應該設法從人道着想，加以禁止或限制嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c216">評『明月香衾』ＡＮｉｇｈｔｉｎＣａｉｌｏ <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在文學方面說，雖然現在已由自然主義而轉入新寫實主義，但是浪漫主義仍然不肯放棄它的存在。同樣，電影作家對於劇本的創作，雖然　得最低限度的任務，應當以現實爲題材，可是生活環境决定了他們的思想和作品的内容，所以在不同的立塲上常將眞實的題材加以非正確的運用。至於要他們走上新Ｒｅａｌｉｓｍ的道路，總大槪是很少可能。然而不僅是如此而已，他們甚至於仍然酣醉於Ｒｏｍａｎｃｅ的甜夢之中，而且，他們亦不願以現實的醜惡或恐怖來使他們的觀衆縐眉頭，特别是日益動搖的小市民層，更容易迷惑於這一迷夢，於是Rｏｍ　ｎｃｅ的作品總能夠得着極大的歡迎。如此，這種影片的攝製，仍然有他粉飾太平的作用存在。也是不容我們稍有忽視。</p>
<p>以上，者是因『明月香衾』的内容所引起的說明。那末這一影片是十足的羅曼斯該是每一個觀衆所不能否認的了。</p>
<p>旣然如此，米高梅的作者們，爲了使這一羅曼斯得着它充分的成效，於是使用了精良的機械和優秀的人材。所以本片的成績，當然不僅是他們自己滿意，在小市民層乃至於有閒階級也會感覺十分滿足。當然，這便是他們的成功。　　很顯明的，在演出技巧方面，沒有那裹不是値得他們誇耀的吧。沙漠的月夜，誘惑的戀歌，美女試浴蘭湯，再撒上鮮花片片。美少年對美女大獻殷勤，雖鞭撻亦所不辭。再爲了女人心的擒服，又忍心使她受盡折磨。欲擒故縱，極盡巧妙之能事。這使我們想起了『卡門』，也使我們想起了『黨人魂』。總之，這藝術家理想中的愛，在優美的畫面上是不餘一滴的表現出來。至於導演家的精細，佈景師以及攝影師的巧妙，以及外景的採取，都不必一一指出個别的特點，也沒有疏陋可以指斥。</p>
<p>雷門諾代羅這一位大明星，我想許多人都知道得十分淸楚。他不久以前在『奈何天』ＭａｔａＨａｖｉ中做了一次嘉寳的情人，這是我們不會忘懷的。同時他很善於裝飾外國人，除了中國人之外現在以擺着埃及人了。他的技藝早已那般精巧，在這裏自然也是成功。然而更値得我們注意的倒是那一位女主角ＭｙｒｎａＬｄｙ我們在『人面獸性』ＴｈｅＡｎｉｍａＫｉｎｇｄｏｍ看過她和安哈婷ＬｅｓｌｉｅＨｏｗａｒｄ二人合演一次，並不見何等成功，可是在這一影片中却有了極大的進展。</p>
<p>總之在這一影片中我們正可看出米高梅在雄厚的資本之下，各方面的演出技巧，都已登峯造極，然而爲了空虚而毫無可取的内容，這種技巧的運用，到底未免可惜罷了。</p>

<p>這件事大槪　琳塔許們的捧客，亦很少知道的。原來牠有一盎斯的香水，那是世界上獨有一盎斯，亦就是一位化學家畢生心血的結晶品。這種香水至今尙未有名稱，所以祇可呌她是無名香水了。這香水那裏來的呢？原來去年麗琳塔許門和愛德門羅一塊兒到倫敦去的時候，他們遇見了一位巴黎的香水製造家。這位製造家，用了多少年的心血，製造一種特殊的香水，但他經過了多少時候，祇能夠提煉出一盎斯的香水。他遇見了塔許門，就將這香水送給牠了。那煉香水的方式亦毁了，所以塔許門就成了這無名香水的專有者了。現在凡到塔許門家裏去的人，都可以聞到一種淸香之味，但是輕微得很。塔許門對於這一盎斯的香水亦珍如拱璧。牠說這奇異的香水，無論在什麽衣服上，祇須染有極小的一滴，就可以永久地存在。無論怎樣洗法，就是那件衣服變成了絲經，那美味總是存在的。</p>

<p>— 沈西苓</p>
<p>因爲是有名的導演（ＣＷＰａｂｓｔ）的作品，並且是從未見過他的作品的緣故，很興奮地到了南京大戲院。</p>
<p>Ａ　術家的悲哀</p>
<p>記得日本社會學家河上肇博士在獄中發表了他自身的哀音；德國科學家愛因斯坦的離開德國而要加入英籍；這ＧＷ·ｐａｂｓｔ導演的作風之轉變····誰說社會的情狀改變，政治潮流的變幻，而不會支派丨丨使他們屈伏丨丨藝術家的轉向？自然，要是Ｇ·Ｗ·ｐａｂｓｔ是個强者，或許不會出此；較弱的，那麽只有他自身知道悲哀；藝術家的悲哀吧。我只知道他是一個前進的導演，今天聞到了好友叔聲的話：』他在希特拉的勢力下，作成了此片，現在已到法國，正在着手製作『堂·吉訶德』丨丨音在弦外，觀衆想也可以體會他的悲哀了。至於他是否還是一個前進的導演家，那只有他自身的將來的作品來證明他了。</p>
<p>Ｂ是詩的夢；是夢的詩；是　　一個法國的軍官，在熱沙的夜裏，迴想到二年前和一個沙漠中的女王的情史。因妖艶的誘惑，殺了愛友，愧對故人，因而逃亡···緩調；如希臘彫刻的維奈斯（Ｖｅｎｕｓ）一般美麗的女主角，充分地描寫出了性的誘惑。細軟的音階，也會給你陶醉。眞是一個詩般的夢，抑也是一個夢般的甜詩。但是也是一杯芬香的毒酒。它足夠帮助了它主人的使命。</p>
<p>Ｃ給中國製片者的參考：丨丨</p>
<p>這戱的分慕上，有着兩個極重要的回述：第一個便是戱的開塲，軍官聖亞凡的回述兩年前的情史，在這裏他（導演者）並不是用着ＦａｄｅｉｎＦａｄｅｏｕｔ也並沒有用着我們常常在外國片裏看到，而是我們以爲最好的手叚的重撮，或Ｄｅｓｏｌｖｅ（如春　夢裏人中的好例）他是用着直接（Ｃｕｔｉｎ）的，可是和直接不同的是在回述的事情的第一個鏡頭，（片上是几只駱駝在沙漠中行動（他是用着『緩慢行動』的技巧；宛像是想像出來的一般。片中第二個回述是在漢德門飲酒後回述到女王當初是一個歌女···的一回事。此地他也是用着Ｃｕｔｉｎ的直接法。不過重要的不是在撮影技術上，而是在音響效果上，這個觀衆想一定可以看出來的。其他如鏡頭變換的地位，和角度上，也能給我們以相當的參考。</p>
<p>Ｄ給觀衆們電影上的知識。丨丨</p>
<p>外國的影片，不容易得到中國内地的觀衆的歡迎；中國的電影爲了要迎合内地觀衆，不能用較深的電影上的技巧，這些交互的關係，都會使中國的電影不進步。正如算術中的加减乘除之外，還得學比例分數一樣，在這片中有着几個地方，是很巧妙地應用着局部的技巧。如最後的飛機影子，沙上的脚跡等等都省去了許多重繁的叙述，在上海的觀衆一定會懂，可是内地的觀衆，未必一定。這些電影上的ＡＢＣ，我想也得有提出的必要吧。</p>

<p>— 孤掌</p>
<p>曼黛維絲主演米高梅公司出品潘格是愛爾蘭漁家一少女。有一天她的父親潘特同了一位仇賴德爵十來到家裏，那位貴人是從英國來的，告訴她說她的祖父新近去世，遺下二百萬鎊財產傳給她！潘格現在由貧賤而　成富貴，睜着眼對着她父親和仇賴德爵士輪流凝視，覺得如在夢中。仇賴德爵士等着要滯領她到英國去承繼遺產。她回頭看看她的父親，他老人家眼睛笑迷迷得異樣。潘格哈了一口長氣，拉攏她的白毛狗，對着牠狂熱地說；『我們發了財了，你現在也是發財的狗了』！她的父親也對她說她以後無須再捉魚了，捉魚不配富貴人家小姐的身分，她今後將住在英國了。</p>
<p>潘格驚喜交集的想着：英國麽丨她的父親曾經告訴過她說英國人的脚同牛脚差不多，是分蹄的。英國麽丨她的父親曾經說過對他是沒有什麽用處的，她去了之後，不曉得過得慣過不慣。她的父親對她說她的母親也是英國人哩。這位貴人仇賴德爵士當然也是英國人了，潘格心裏想着，眼睛溜着看看他的脚，却是人脚而不像分蹄牛脚。她又看看他的面孔。他面貎很老誠，微帶笑容也在對着她看。她說，『或者那裏也有一兩個好人呢。』　　她的父親吩咐她趕快預備動身。潘格便飛奔上樓，到了半扶梯，又回頭呌着她父親說她要把他的衣服同放在一隻箱子裏。她的父親回答說請她不要管他，他是不同她去呢。潘格聽他說不一同去，便又飛奔回到他跟前說那末她也不去呢。潘特便和仇賴德抛了一個眼色，對他女兒說他不過現在不同她去罷了。他心裏却想着他的女兒將同他永遠分離了。她此去將同她的姑母齊吉斯特和她的表姊妹阿拉立克和伊塞爾同居了。他想到不能再同女兒相見便有戀戀不捨之意，不過想到他自己不過是一個貧賤的漁夫，而漁夫生活飄流不動，眞所謂今天不知明天事，他一朝死了之後，有誰照顧她呢，因此他决計讓她愛女去承繼遺產。但是他却不敢把眞情告訴她。</p>
<p>潘格勉强忽忙地穿上她最好的衣服，準備跟着仇賴德動身。臨行她對着她的父親叮　着說他一定要來的，否則她是要回來的。她跑上扶梯之後，仇賴德對那老者說他不應當歎騙女兒。那老者說這是呌她肯去的唯一辦法，她去了之後，他可以呌人替他寫信告訴她說他死了，她可以就此　再思家了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Requisition of Eight Counties in Eastern Luan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yin Tong met with He Yingqin and Huang Fu to report on the progress of the requisition. A separate solution is being sought for the Yuguan area, and the Ping-Yu through traffic is expected to be realized. (Beiping) The eight counties in the Luan River basin have been completely requisitioned. Personnel requisitioning Lulong and Qian'an counties traveled via the Ping-Yu Avenue, and the requisition proceeded smoothly. Official sources denied the matter of Linyu refusing to be requisitioned, explaining that the Linyu County government had moved to Haiyang half a year before the Yuguan Incident. Due to the complexity of requisitioning, it is still necessary to go to Haiyang to complete the process. The requisition train returned to Qinhuangdao because the route from Qinhuangdao to Haiyang is shorter. There are no other issues. The requisition has now been completed. A small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in Linyu County, but the Japanese side has agreed to withdraw. The Hebei provincial government and the Linyu County government will urge them to do so and send security police to take over. Regarding the requisition in the northern region, Miyun and Huairou counties were requisitioned yesterday, and Jixian County will be requisitioned tomorrow. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong of the Requisitioning Committee said that he had received a notice from the Japanese side stating that the bandits in Qian'an had been eliminated by the Japanese army, and they hoped that our side would send personnel to take over as soon as possible. As for the Linyu County government, it is currently located in Haiyang Town, but there are Japanese troops and puppet organizations there, which is very inconvenient. It is planned to move to Qinhuangdao to work after the Japanese troops withdraw and the puppet organizations are dissolved. Regarding the through traffic on the Beining Railway, he will leave the pass soon to discuss this. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong met with He Yingqin and Huang Fu today to report on the requisition of Luan County, Funing, and other counties. He will go to Tianjin tonight. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are many difficulties in whether the Doushan Governance Bureau and Xinglong County can be requisitioned, because the Japanese side said that both places are outside the Great Wall line and are puppet territory, so our side cannot requisition them. In fact, both places straddle the inside and outside of the Great Wall. The county seat requisitioned in Linyu County yesterday is in Haiyang Town, and the Yuguan area is also under the jurisdiction of the county and should be requisitioned by us. However, when our requisitioning personnel arrived at Yuguan, Ruo He (likely a name) said that there were many Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan and that there were organizations established by Manchukuo. Fearing that this would cause misunderstandings, he requested that the county territory of Haiyang Town be requisitioned first, and that the requisition of Yuguan be postponed slightly. It was found that the Yuguan garrison was dispatched by the Japanese Tianjin Garrison, and the Kwantung Army was not the main body. Ruo He meant that the armistice agreement and the general meeting were consultations between the Kwantung Army and the North China military, not the Chinese and Japanese governments. The Tianjin Garrison did not participate. A separate solution is needed for the Yuguan area, so negotiations are still necessary. A staff officer of the Japanese Yuguan garrison, Hattori Brigade, told Yin Tong that it would be difficult for the Japanese army to complete the return of the Jinbu troops to the Great Wall line by the end of the month. According to the agreement, it is expected to be completed around the 5th or 6th of next month. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong originally planned to go to Changchun from Yu to meet with Muto to discuss the Ping-Yu through traffic, but this was cancelled due to Muto's death. According to a telegram from the Kwantung Army, there are still 6,000 puppet troops under so-and-so in the Zunhua area, who were originally under the control of Li Jichun but later disobeyed Li's command. Therefore, the Kwantung Army decided to disarm them and escort them outside the pass. Through traffic will resume after this is completely handled. In addition to the 6,000 soldiers dismissed from Li Jichun's troops, there are still 2,800 to 2,900 soldiers. Their dismissal expenses were paid by Li. Zheng Yanhou, a subordinate of Li's, disobeyed Li's command and returned outside the pass, and his troops were also dismissed. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet troops in Jixian, Zunhua, Qian'an and other counties mostly belong to Li Shoushan's troops. The Japanese side will send them out of the pass before our side can take over, which may be slightly delayed. The Japanese troops in various places plan to withdraw separately after our side has completed the requisition. The Beining Railway through traffic was urged by telegram to the other party yesterday. According to a reply telegram from the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Army stated that the Ping-Yu through traffic will definitely not violate the spirit of the Dalian Conference and is expected to be realized on the 5th or 6th of next month. (30th Press Dispatch) (Beiping) Yin Tong resigned as the Eastern Route Commissioner, and it is said that Tao Shangming will be transferred to the Eastern Route, and Yin Rugeng will be appointed to the Northern Route. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army is ordering Li Shoushan's puppet troops in Zunhua to be disarmed. After the disarming is completed, they will be sent out of the pass, which will be completed in seven or eight days. Miyun and Huairou can be completely requisitioned today. Brigade Commander Suzuki expressed his welcome to our requisition. He hoped that the old county government staff who contributed would be retained, and the new county magistrate has agreed. The new county magistrate has completed the requisition procedures at the Suzuki Brigade headquarters yesterday. The former Miyun county magistrate, Zhu Yi, returned to Beiping after the requisition to report on the situation. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The so-called Eastern Allied Army arrived in Tangshan on the 29th and camped at the Fulun School, waiting for the puppet Fengshan train to transport them outside the pass. The stone mines will be transported from Qinhuangdao to Tangshan within a few days and then transferred to Yutian. The requisition train was still waiting in Qinhuangdao on the 30th for loading. (30th Press Dispatch) (Beiping) Except for a few counties where the bandit atmosphere is still strong and cannot be requisitioned, the requisition work in eastern Luan can now be considered complete. Although the Japanese troops in Linyu have agreed to withdraw within a week, the county seat is still in the hands of the Japanese army. Therefore, the Linyu county government is temporarily located in Haiyang Town, which was requisitioned yesterday. In the future, traffic from Beiping to Shanhaiguan can be restored. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Jichun recently sent a telegram to Tianjin announcing his inauguration. The original text reads: "To Chairman Huang and Chairman He in Beiping, Chairman Yu in Tianjin, and all newspapers, institutions, and legal groups in Tianjin and Beiping: On the 28th of this month, I received a letter from the War Zone Requisitioning Committee stating that it intends to recommend Jichun as the Chairman of the War Zone Miscellaneous Army Reorganization Committee. I immediately used the official seal and took office. I have been in the military all my life and have long wanted to retire. However, the war zone is devastated, and there are countless redundant troops. As a native of this place, it is difficult to refuse. I am now starting to reorganize and disband them separately. I hope you will give me guidance so that I can follow your instructions. I am sincerely looking forward to it. Li Jichun respectfully, with seal." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The three puppet Beiping naval gunboats, Enmin, Xiamin, and Huimin, have been processed and built by the Kawasaki Shipyard in Harbin and were launched on the 12th. Each ship is equipped with five machine guns and cannons. The righteous army leader, Da Tianxia's, forces are rising again, and traces of his troops have been found in Pingdingbao, Tieling. The Japanese army has dispatched teams on three routes to attack. Zhu Jiqing and Wang Xianting's troops are near western Liaoning, and their power has resurged. The two troops, totaling more than 3,000 people, encountered a part of the Japanese army Hattori and a team of Xingcheng puppet police north of Dabianmen in Xingcheng at 11:00 a.m. on the 14th. They engaged in fierce fighting for half a day. More than 120 puppet police were killed or wounded, and 16 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The righteous army suffered very few casualties.

<p>Chiang States That He Will Never Increase the Burden on the People of Qing (Beiping) A telegram from Datong stated that the troops of Sun Dianying's army stationed in the Chaigoubao area have largely completed their departure. Yu Shiming, the deputy army commander of Sun's army, led the rear personnel of the headquarters and passed through Datong on the 28th to the west, intending to stay in Suiyuan for a while before going to Baotou. Two regiments of Sun's army stationed in Jincheng also arrived in Datong on foot on the 28th, waiting for transportation to the west. In addition, there are more than 10,000 unarmed soldiers remaining in southern Shanxi. Sun originally planned to transfer these soldiers to Shanxi Province for reorganization, but Yan is worried that he will not be able to raise the military expenses, so it has not yet been decided whether to accept them. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang telegraphed Ma Lin, chairman of Qinghai Province, and Ma Bufang, commander of the 9th Division, stating that the Central Government's dispatch of Sun Dianying to Qinghai to lead troops to reclaim land is for the benefit of Qinghai.

<h3 id="e9">Military Issues Were Discussed Extensively at the Lushan Conference <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Plans to Improve the National Army and Reduce Provinces and Regions, Which Will Be Submitted to the National Congress for Discussion. (Nanjing) Many military issues were discussed at this Lushan conference, the most important of which are the training of senior officers of the armies and divisions suppressing bandits, the distribution of military pay, etc. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that President Wang's trip to Lushan only involved participating in discussions on political matters. The most important of these are roughly the following: 1. Resolving the Chahar issue, as seen in the joint telegram from Wang and Chiang. Feng should also clearly understand the Central Government's sincerity towards him. From now on, we should be honest with each other and work together to move forward. 2. After the US cotton and wheat loan contract was signed, the southwest initially misunderstood that the Central Government had other intentions and therefore strongly opposed it. However, the Central Government's proposal is specifically intended to use these loans for production. Therefore, the suggestions of the Legislative Yuan have been fully accepted. President Wang has repeatedly stated that it will never be used for internal strife. It is heard that the results of discussions with Chairman Chiang are completely consistent and that future facts will prove it. 3. Reducing the number of provinces and regions has long been decided by the Central Government and is preparing to implement it. Recently, the Central Political Council decided to form a special committee to study this, ordering the provincial and municipal governments to provide reference materials in preparation for drafting a plan for further discussion. It may be submitted for discussion at the upcoming Central National Congress. 4. The issue of large-scale development in the Northwest is also a major case at this Lushan conference. In recent years, the Central Government has long been determined to develop the Northwest, but this has not been realized due to various facts. In terms of the current situation, it is really impossible to delay any longer. The chaos in Xinjiang and the conflicts in Kangzang must be resolved thoroughly and quickly. Next Monday, the Central Memorial Week, President Wang was originally scheduled to attend and report. He telegraphed to inquire about his travel schedule and received a reply yesterday stating that he was afraid he would not be able to return by the end of this month. Also, according to political news, the Lushan Conference closed on the 28th, and detailed plans have been made for major policies, roughly as described in Wang and Chiang's joint telegram. In addition, there are specific decisions regarding the Xinjiang incident. The key civil and military positions in the province can be submitted to the State Council for approval this Tuesday. Wang is scheduled to leave Lushan with Gu Mengyu, Zhu Jiahua, and Zeng Zhongming on the 30th and take a ship east to Jin. He is expected to arrive in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 31st. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Lushan Conference decided to unify the national military power and reduce the number of provinces and regions as the basic policies for reorganizing the military and administration. Wang and Chiang have telegraphed Guangdong to solicit opinions. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang believes that the work of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi is coming to an end. In the future, the improvement of the national army plans to try out the division district system and the regimental district system. On the one hand, it will prevent the past abuses of the social defense army, and on the other hand, it will promote preparations for the implementation of conscription. Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, and Chen Yi will be appointed to draft methods, preparing to gradually implement them within six months. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) According to a telegram from Lushan, the Central Committee members, due to Sun Ke's arrival in Lushan, are discussing the final solution to the Chahar issue, as well as the Fifth National Congress and all important issues of the current situation, and have postponed their return to Nanjing. There will be an important meeting today and tomorrow. (29th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Yi, Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, went to Xunri to participate in the Lushan Conference. Now that he has completed his work, he took a ship to Nanjing on the 30th. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Central Government Attaches Importance to the Case of France Occupying Nine Small Islands <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Orders to Consult the General Staff and Navy to Thoroughly Investigate (Nanjing) People in diplomatic circles say that in addition to ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the embassy in France to investigate the truth about the case of France occupying nine small islands, the Central Government has also ordered the General Staff and the Navy to consult on ways to thoroughly investigate. In recent days, the general situation has been briefly described, and suggestions on the steps of negotiation have been signed and reported to Chiang and Wang. After approval of the method, the government will begin to implement it. The first step in the future will be to select specialists from the General Staff and the Navy to go to the islands by ship and consult with experts from Guangdong who are familiar with the situation of the islands. After verification, it will be used as a basis for negotiation. Before the exact situation is clear, the government will temporarily refrain from expressing its position. The government recently received a telegram from Guangdong, proving that the nine small islands are south of Qiongya and are indeed Chinese territorial waters. Every year, fishermen from Guangdong and Fujian take turns to go there to fish, with hundreds of people. However, because all sides are saltwater and there is a lack of drinking water, those who come here need to bring water and cannot stay for long, so they are all mobile in nature. The General Staff and the Navy plan to select specialists for the investigation of the nine islands and consult with experts from Guangdong who are familiar with the situation of the islands to go to the islands by ship. Gu Weijun replied to the nine-island matter, saying that France is conducting an investigation, and the Navy Department will also send the previously surveyed longitude and latitude to the Ministry for research. Now, the Ministry is conducting detailed research on the longitude and latitude. The islands are hundreds of miles away from the Xisha Islands and have nothing to do with the various sand islands. The area of the islands is very small, about 1,500 meters. The only important thing now is to investigate whether there was an international declaration when our country occupied the islands, such as raising flags, firing cannons, and notifying various countries. If there is a record, the islands can be immediately recovered. The Qiongya native association in Beijing said that the nine islands were occupied by France, and the language, customs, and habits of the islanders are no different from those of the Qiongya people. As for the islands' fishing resources, dozens of fishing boats from Qiongya must set out for the islands to fish every spring and return fully loaded by late autumn. However, the distance from Qiongya is relatively far, and the facilities are beyond reach. Japanese people send a large number of fishing boats to lay nets along the islands every year to catch fish. Japan and France have long coveted the islands. Unexpectedly, they were occupied by the French Navy. The Qiongya people in Beijing are extremely angry and have decided to convene an emergency meeting to petition the Central Government to find a way to negotiate for recovery in order to save sovereignty.

<p>And Did Not Suggest Dividing Xinjiang Province into Several Regions (Nanjing) Huang Musong returned to Nanjing from Jiangxi on the Jiangjing steamer on the morning of the 30th. According to him, the government will decide on the plan for the aftermath of Xinjiang. During this trip to Lushan, he only reported on his work as a pacifier in Xinjiang and the two incidents, without making any proposals or suggesting that Xinjiang Province be divided into three regions for governance. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to people around Huang Musong, Huang's trip to Jiangxi was to meet with Chiang and Wang to report on the changes in Xinjiang and the current situation. He left it to the government to decide on the future handling policy. Huang submitted a written proposal to the Central Government on the political and military organization of Xinjiang Province and the reasons for the twelve incidents. The reorganization method is divided into three points: (1) Liu Shengzhen will be removed from his current position. (2) The Central Government will select suitable talents familiar with the situation in Xinjiang to assist him. (3) The Central Government will send a senior official to sit in the province and supervise the reorganization. It is heard that the principles have been decided by the Lushan Conference and will be brought to Nanjing by President Wang and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being officially announced. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong completed his mission to Lushan and left Xunri on the Jiangqing steamer on the morning of the 29th, arriving in Nanjing at 10:30 a.m. on the 30th. According to him, in Lushan, he only made detailed reports to President Jiang and Chairman Chiang on the actual situation in Xinjiang, the recent changes, and his work as a pacifier in Xinjiang, so that the government could decide on the method of handling. Wang and Chiang will deliberate on the actual situation and make a decision. He was not in a position to express his opinion and did not make any suggestions. The reports stating that he advocated dividing Xinjiang Province into several regions are not true. He was in Lushan for less than two days, and apart from reporting on the new events in Xinjiang, he had no other mission. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Huang Musong's return to Nanjing, it has been widely rumored that Huang suggested to the Central Government that Xinjiang Province be divided into several provinces. A reporter inquired with Zhang Fengjiu on the 30th, who said that it would be fine to divide Xinjiang, which is vast, into several provinces, but it is not possible at present. (1) The population of Xinjiang is only more than 2 million, which is equivalent to a large county in provinces like Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If it is divided into several provinces, there will inevitably be land without people. (2) Xinjiang has always been a province subsidized by the central government. It has been in turmoil for years, and its economy is even more difficult. If it is divided into provinces and governed, adding many institutions and officials, the people of Xinjiang will definitely not be able to afford the military and administrative expenses. (3) The Central Government now prefers to have fewer facts than more facts regarding the frontier regions. If it causes disputes due to the division of provinces, it would not be appropriate. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Piguang, the representative of Li Du, said that the 7,000-plus troops of Li's army who retreated from Russia into Xinjiang have now been reorganized into the Xinjiang Provincial Defense Army. Li had sent Wang Ziyao as a representative to Xinjiang to offer condolences and had also contacted Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai. Recently, he received a telegram from Wang stating that he had arrived in Dihua, met with Liu Sheng, and the talks were very satisfactory. (30th Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Our Country Will Surely Implement Constitutional Government <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Its Method Will Be a Kind of Provincial Autonomy (Paris) Zhang Xueliang is currently traveling in various European countries and is paying special attention to aviation affairs, carefully inspecting the military developments of the new era. Today, when Zhang spoke to a Reuters reporter about his intentions, he expressed his gratitude to Mussolini for allowing him to understand the great progress of the Italian Air Force. Having come to France, the French government also allowed him to visit aircraft manufacturing plants and view tank exercises and night flights of aircraft. Zhang is scheduled to go to England tomorrow to continue his learning and then plans to visit Germany. As for politics, Zhang is focused on investigating movements such as Fascism and Communism. He seems to feel that China will one day implement a constitutional government system, perhaps through a kind of provincial autonomy. However, according to Zhang, China's real problem is the economy. Today, Zhang and Song Ziwen had breakfast together, and Song then went to Cherbourg, intending to return to China via Canada. Yesterday, Chinese diplomats stationed in Europe gathered to bid farewell to Song Ziwen, including the Minister to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, the Ambassador to Russia, Yan Huiqing, and the Ministers to Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

<p>The China-America Report Ends</p>
<h3 id="e13">Collect Recipient-Pays Telegrams <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Merchants and the Press Are Greatly Inconvenienced. The US Government Will Issue a Statement. (Washington, 29th National News) The US Combined Radio Corporation, Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company, and Pacific Commercial Cable Company announced that from August 1st, they will stop receiving recipient-pays telegrams between the Far East and the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, and Honolulu. Today, the US State Department stated that it is currently investigating the matter and will issue a statement. According to the reasons stated by the telegraph companies, they only said that they had suffered monetary losses from the recipient-pays telegrams sent from the Far East to the United States. However, at the same time, they also cancelled the recipient-pays telegrams sent from the United States, Canada, and other places to the Far East, which has greatly inconvenienced newspapers, news agencies, and merchants, who have had to change their communication methods. At present, most of the news telegrams originating from the Far East are recipient-pays, while those sent to the Far East are generally sender-pays. As for commercial telegrams, only a few companies sent recipient-pays telegrams from the Far East a month ago, but last month, a total of 80 companies in Shanghai applied for permission to send recipient-pays telegrams to the United States and Canada. According to the gold franc, international telegram fees have been calculated. However, since the devaluation of gold dollars in the United States and Canada, the various companies have suffered unexpected losses in remitting the report fees that the Chinese government should have received due to the frequent fluctuations in the price of gold dollars, so they have stopped receiving them. As for the impact of this measure, according to Howard, a giant in the American press, it will greatly inconvenience merchants and the press and cost them more. At a time when the United States urgently needs to know the Far East policies and actions in detail and the Far East urgently needs to know the United States' policies and actions in detail, this is a short-sighted act. Even in terms of profit and loss, it may be outweighed by the losses. If the Far East today is as everyone says, a world explosive, then the best insurance against the explosion is to allow the free flow of news between the two sides.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Re-Discussion on France Occupying Nine Small Islands in China's South Sea <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>From April 7th to 12th of this year, the French navy planted the tricolor flag on nine small islands in China's South Sea. On July 14th, this matter was slightly leaked. By the 25th, they announced the official occupation. The nine islands are: Cayeux, Damas, Paize, Ituba, Deux, Laitou, Titu, Spratly Island, and two attached islands. They are located between French Annam, British Borneo, and American Philippines, about one hundred and several tens of *li* from the Guangdong coast. The total area of the nine islands is three hundred *mu*, less than half a square mile. Since the French announcement, all sectors of China have been greatly shocked. Although only fishermen have resided on these islands in the past, the right of territorial ownership cannot be infringed upon. Now, French warships have suddenly announced their occupation, which is no different from aggression. Moreover, at the same time, the Japanese side is widely spreading the news that the islands were discovered long ago by Japanese merchants, expressing their determination to compete with the French. International disputes seem to be just beginning and not yet over. The French initially did not want this matter to attract international attention, saying that the occupation of the nine islands was only for navigational convenience. Later, in view of the reactions from various parties, they argued that it was an "occupation without any imperialistic implications." However, in any case, the issue of the occupation of these small islands has aroused close international attention.</p>
<p>We should observe this issue from two perspectives: our national sovereignty and international relations. First, from the aspect of our national sovereignty, the nine islands occupied by the French are indeed our territory. Therefore, the government should make a resolute protest to the French. Upon investigating the location of the nine islands announced by the French, they are said to be located at 10 degrees north latitude and 115 degrees east longitude, seemingly close to our Xisha Islands, or perhaps part of the archipelago. The French have long coveted the Xisha Islands. Three years ago, they even made an attempt to occupy them. The dispute of that day remains an outstanding issue. There are more than twenty islands, large and small, in the Xisha Islands, scattered in the sea. Those being occupied this time may just be the small islands at the southern end. Yesterday, a Havas Paris dispatch reported that the French government occupied Spratly Island, the largest of the nine islands, on April 13, 1930, which is possible evidence. Although coastal islands may be of no economic value, they play an important role in defending the border. In the past century, China has been left wide open due to the occupation of coastal islands. Now, these islands are again coveted by a strong neighbor. Whether for the sake of sovereignty or border defense, the Chinese government cannot but argue with reason. Second, from the perspective of international relations, the French occupation of the nine small islands is nothing less than a prelude to the great powers returning to the policy of striving for and safeguarding colonies. The claim of navigational convenience is a clear pretext, while the military purpose is an undeniable fact. The nine islands are located halfway between Singapore and Hong Kong, shielding Annam. In terms of France's position in the Far East, their military effectiveness is significant. From another perspective, what benefits France inevitably harms other countries. Therefore, after the French occupation, the Tokyo telegraph broadcast the atmosphere that the Japanese had previously occupied them. There are two versions of the story. One is that a Japanese merchant named Hashimoto requested the Japanese government to occupy the islands on October 7, 1918. Another is that a man named Hirata Suetsugu operated a mine on the island and named the islands the Hirata Islands. The fierce competition between Japan and France over these nine small islands is already evident. Remembering the beginning of the September 18th Incident, Britain and France, with a compromising attitude, hoped that the Japanese would be the protectors of the colonies of the great powers in the Far East. When Japan broke away from the League of Nations and its ambition for exclusive control was exposed, the imperialists realized the need to protect their colonies with their own strength. The failure of the London Economic Conference further promoted this trend. However, the promotion of this trend, whether in tangible or intangible ways, seems to be aimed at China's borders. The Hengqin Island case has not long passed, and the nine islands in the South Sea have been invaded and occupied again. Looking to the future, it is chilling.</p>
<p>It has been five or six days since the French government announced the occupation of the nine islands, and the Chinese government is still in the midst of "dispatching personnel for surveying" and "preparing protests." Diplomatic actions should be practical and swift. The geographical situation of the nine islands should be carefully investigated. However, completing the investigation in the shortest possible time and lodging a serious protest is the common demand of the people. If we procrastinate and act perfunctorily, the greed of the strong will be unlimited. Are the future troubles of our country still imaginable?</p>
<h3 id="e15">Trade Pressure on Japan from Various Countries <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Japan Plans Fundamental Countermeasures (Tokyo) Since the adjournment of the Economic Conference, the pressure from Britain on trade with Japan has become increasingly apparent. Australia and the Malay Federation are also gradually discussing raising tariffs, and the Union of South Africa also advocates trade pressure on Japan, which makes Japan's future foreign trade situation even more significant. Therefore, the foreign affairs authorities are also studying permanent countermeasures, and have now established the following fundamental guidelines, which will soon be proposed to the relevant authorities and private sector operators, in order to promote the development of Japan's trade organization: (1) Domestic countermeasures: Use the Trade Council to establish an organized trade policy, while urging private exporters to carry out voluntary export controls. If voluntary control is difficult, establish an export association law to control exports with the power of the government. Also, in overseas markets, prohibit the auctioning and unfair dumping of exporters by means of laws. (2) Foreign countermeasures: Revise the past liberalism and unconditional most-favored-nation treatment treaty, and base it on the principle of individual reciprocal negotiation. The establishment of a trade agreement with a foreign country must be agreed to, but the agreement is limited to quantity agreements, excluding market agreements and price agreements. Also, take the agreement as a principle, and use it as an agreement between the other country and Japanese operators. In addition, adapt to the trade relations between the other country and Japan. Furthermore, between the government and operators of the other country, set a certain commodity and a certain amount of barter agreement. (30th day, Dentsu telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the adjournment of the Economic Conference, the main points of the financial and economic policies of the Japanese Ministry of Finance are as follows: (1) Compile the next year's budget. Due to the breakdown of the economic meeting and the confrontation between countries, the tendency of joint economy has further promoted the construction of the economic union between Japan and Manchuria, and the budget expanded due to this is unavoidable. The financial resources of the budget are in the process of restoring the economy. At present, it is difficult to increase taxes and expand official industries. It is necessary to seek public achievements. (2) Trade policy: In accordance with commercial ethics and the export control of the association, ensure the existing market, and must move towards opening up new markets. (3) Tariff policy: If a foreign country starts an unreasonable tariff war, Japan will also carry out retaliatory tariffs. When necessary, grant the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Commerce and Industry the autocratic power of the tariff law. (4) Exchange rate policy: The exchange rate for speculation, etc., is fully controlled by the application of the exchange rate management law. As for the exchange rate balance setting fund system, it is not only difficult to implement, but also considered unnecessary. Therefore, with the goal of enriching the economic and financial situation without deteriorating the domestic finances and without changing the exchange rate, we will quietly observe the market activity. (5) Low-interest policy: Thorough low-interest policy, and strive to restore and promote the economy. (30th day, Dentsu telegraph)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Internal disputes within the Kwantung Army have been intensifying since the time of General Mutō. The conflict between Mutō and Koiso has been rumored among the Japanese that General Mutō's actions have lost their freedom. Some say that Lieutenant General Koiso will be transferred to be the commander of his division during the regular move in August. The rumors are inconsistent. Originally, Lieutenant General Koiso was not from the Araki faction. Although he was close to Ugaki, he was not from the Ugaki faction. He was a fighter from the middle faction. His intelligence and ability to handle things well have allowed him to reach his current position. After Mutō's death, Koiso has lost his opponent, and the new commander is also from the middle faction, so the internal disputes within the Kwantung Army may disappear from now on. However, there are many members of the Araki faction in the Kwantung Army. The dispute between the commander and the chief of staff may be eliminated, but the opposition between the two factions is not easy to resolve, or it may lead to further internal strife from now on. The future is still difficult to predict. (30th day, China United Press)</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Increases Subsidies by 2 Million Yen Compared to Last Year (Tokyo) The expiration date of the Ministry of Communications' mandated routes will be from March to December of next year. Due to the depression in the shipping industry, various shipping companies have requested an increase in route subsidies. The Ministry of Communications, in view of the importance of the routes to the United States and China, decided to increase the subsidy for the North American route by 950,000 yen, and the coastal and Yangtze River routes in China by 770,000 yen. The distribution of various shipping companies is recorded as follows: Nippon Yusen 790,000 yen, Osaka Shosen 90,000 yen, Nisshin Kisen 770,000 yen. Therefore, the total amount of route subsidies in the 9th fiscal year budget reached 21,339,000 yen, an increase of 1,939,000 yen compared to last year. (30th day, Dentsu telegraph)</p>

<p>Working Hours Reduced to 35 Hours Per Week, Lowest Wages Average About 14 Yuan Per Week, Capitalists Have Slight Objections to This Plan (New York) An investigation into the national situation in the United States shows that after the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act next Monday, at least 500,000 unemployed people will be able to get jobs on Monday morning. Their lowest wages will average 14 yuan per week, and the earnings of skilled workers will be far more than this. It is estimated that the wages of these newly employed people will be close to 10 million yuan per week, which will be of great benefit to the people's livelihood. As for child labor, it is expected to be abolished in about ten days, because it is extremely uneconomical to hire child labor under the new minimum wage regulations. As for working hours, they are reduced to an average of 35 hours per week. However, many large industries plan to keep machines running for 80 hours per week, while the maximum working hours for workers are 40 hours per week. Therefore, the working hours of machines will be more than twice that of employees. (29th day, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Woodin declared that the government will issue public bonds of 5 billion yuan for the economic recovery plan. To facilitate public cooperation, some of the public bonds will have very low face values, only 50 yuan per bond. (29th day, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The National Association of Manufacturers today proposed an important issue concerning President Roosevelt's movement to increase the purchasing power of American labor. The association decided to ask its members not to sign automatic blank regulations for the time being. (These regulations stipulate the working hours and wages for industries that have not submitted their own satisfactory regulations.) They must wait until they find out how those in charge of implementing the national recovery plan will handle workers whose existing wages are higher than the minimum but whose weekly working hours are longer than those stipulated in the regulations before they can sign blank regulations. The association said that if a clause in the regulations, a joint clause, stipulates that workers paid by the hour must be paid wages according to the reduced weekly price for their reduced working hours, many industrial contracts will be unsustainable. American industries have supported business and suffered losses for the past three years. Those whose finances are exhausted are counted by the year. Now, they cannot bear the increased labor costs without higher prices and wider sales. Those who have shorter working hours should have their wages increased appropriately by means of equal adjustment. According to official opinion, if this regulation is turned into a tool for reducing higher wages in order to divide the work so as to compensate for lower wages, it would run counter to the original intention of the regulation. Therefore, it is expected that workers with higher wages will be given equal adjustments in wages to compensate for their fewer working hours. (29th day, Reuters)</p>

This is One of the Events That President Roosevelt Will Discuss With Him After Hull Returns to the United States From London. Other Events Include the Position of Deputy Secretary of State Professor Moley, It Is Generally Believed That Moley and Hull Have Different Views on Economic Issues, so Moley May be Transferred to Another Position, During the London Economic Conference, Professor Moley Once Advocated the Passage of a Declaration on Currency Issues, but it Was Later Vetoed by President We, the President Deeply Appreciated Hull's Achievements in London, and Other Countries' Diplomatic Experts Unanimously Praised Hull's Calmness and Sincerity, at Present, Business Negotiations Between the United States and Argentina and Various Latin American Countries Are Already Underway, and Will Make More Progress After Hull Returns to the United States.

<h3 id="e23">The World Economic Conference Failed, and War Debt Negotiations Stalled <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Now That the World Economic Conference Has Come to Nothing, Public Opinion Here Also Expresses Great Doubt About Whether the Issue of War Debts Can Proceed Smoothly, Although the US President Intends to Discuss a Revised War Debt Repayment Schedule With Representatives of the Debtor Nations, Those Outside the White House Have Already Frankly Acknowledged That Negotiations Will Be in Vain, Because the Position of the United States Today Can No Longer Provide Anything as Compensation for Debt Repayment. Before the London Conference, It Was Widely Believed That After the United States Reduced Tariffs, It Could Make It Easier for Debtor Nations to Repay Their Debts, and the Debtor Nations Themselves Also Declared That When the United States Built High Tariff Walls, It Could No Longer Hope to Repay War Debts, Now That the London Conference Has Failed to Reduce Tariffs, Coupled With the Fact That the US President's Industrial Recovery Plan Will Increase Tariffs When Necessary to Protect Domestic Agriculture and Industry and Prevent Foreign Goods From Competing, the US President Still Holds the Power to Increase or Decrease Tariffs After Investigating the Cost of Production at Home and Abroad, It Is No Longer Possible to Guarantee a Reduction in Tariffs. This Situation Has Also Been Discussed by the Diplomatic Community Here, and No Remedy Has Been Found, but It Is Not Attributed to the US President, Acknowledging That the US Government Has Made It Easier for Debtor Nations to Repay Their Debts After Depreciating the Value of the Gold Dollar, However, on the Part of the Debtor Nations, Due to the Sudden Passage of the Industrial Recovery Act by the US Congress, It Is No Longer Possible to Sell More Goods in the US and Raise Funds to Repay Debts. Therefore, at the Beginning of This Month, It Was Widely Expected That the US President Would Launch War Debt Negotiations Immediately After Returning to the Capital, but One Month Has Passed Without Any Movement. The President's Planned Trip to His Hometown in New York State, Including Whether He Invited Diplomatic Representatives of the Debtor Nations to Talk at Hyde Park, Has Not Been Expressed by People in the White House.

<p>Temporarily Adopting a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards China (Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida and Other Key Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Have Held Head Meetings for Days to Study Diplomatic Policies to Cope With the World Economic War After the Failure of the Economic Conference and the Amendment to the Naval Treaty at the Washington Conference and the London Conference in 1935. Now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Largely Decided to Take the Following Diplomatic Guidelines as Its Foundation: (1) Policy Towards China: Japan Will Always Maintain a Self-Determined and Tough Attitude Towards China in Accordance With Established Guidelines, Resolutely Reject All Aid Plans of the League of Nations and the United Kingdom and the United States to China, and Strive to Make China Automatically Recognize the True Meaning of the Monroe Doctrine of the East; (2) Trade Policy: After the Failure of the Economic Conference, the World Economic War Will Inevitably Intensify, and the Attack on Japan by Countries Around the World Will Be Particularly Fierce. Japan Should Consider Self-Defense Measures Against This, While Actively Adopting the Policy of Developing Overseas Markets for Japanese Goods, That Is, First Concluding Reciprocal Trade Treaties With Countries That Have Close Relations, While Actively Taking Retaliatory Measures Against Countries That Suppress Japanese Trade, and Opening Up Markets in Africa, India, the South Pacific, Central America, and South America in the Shortest Possible Time in Order to Develop Japan's Foreign Trade; (3) General International Policy: Since Japan Withdrew From the League of Nations, Although it Has Resumed an Independent Diplomatic Policy, it Should Adopt a Compromising Policy in Negotiations With Various Countries. Therefore, Embassies Will Be Established in Egypt, South Africa, Afghanistan, Colombia, and Ethiopia, and New International Cultural Bureaus Will Be Established to Strive to Enhance Cultural Relations With Various Countries; (4) Policy Towards the Washington Conference in 1935: At the Washington Conference in 1935, Japan Demands Equality Between Japan's Naval Power and That of the United Kingdom and the United States. The Conference Will Definitely Discuss General Pacific Issues Such as the Issue of China's International Management [Manchukuo], in Order to Implement the Reasonable Claims of the Japanese Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Established a Research Department as a Staff Agency to Study Fundamental Countermeasures.

<p>(Tokyo) The New Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kuwashima, Visited Foreign Minister Uchida, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, Director of the Treaty Bureau Kuriyama, and Others at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Morning of the 29th to Report on the Current Situation in North China and Exchange Views on Policy Towards China. As a Result, it Was Decided That Japan Would Continue to Adopt a Quiet Observation Policy Towards China, That Is, Since China Filed the Sino-Japanese Issue With the League of Nations, It Has Seemed to Have No Pro-Japanese Attitude, but Has Concluded Contracts With the United States and European Countries to Borrow Money or Import Weapons, and Has Cooperated With the League of Nations to Adopt Anti-Japanese Policies. At This Time, Japan's Strong Talk of an Asian Alliance With China Will Definitely Have No Results, so We Will Temporarily Continue to Adopt a Quiet Observation Policy and Establish a Policy Towards China at an Appropriate Time.

<p>Using the Pretext That European and American Loans Will Be Used for Anti-Japanese Purposes, It Actually Wants to Dispose of the Collateral to Force Us to Repay Our Debts, but in Reality, We Have Never Recognized the Loans From the West (Tokyo) Japan's Loans to China, Including Principal and Interest, Total 1 Billion Yuan. The Nanjing Government Often Adopts an Irresponsible Attitude Towards the Following Political Loans and Nishihara Loans, That Is: (1) The Telephone Loan of 15 Million Yuan Established by the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company and the Ministry of Communications in the 7th Year of the Taisho Period; (2) 25 Million Yuan Established by the Company and the Ministry of Communications in the 12th Year of the Taisho Period; (3) The Telegraph Line Loan of 1.5 Million Yuan and Other 4 Million Yuan Established by the Company and the Ministry of Communications in the 8th Year of the Taisho Period; (4) The Wired Telegraph Loan of 20 Million Yuan Funded by the Kogyo Bank, the Taiwan Bank, and the Chosen Bank Through the China Remittance Industry Bank in the 7th Year of the Taisho Period; (5) The Second Wired Telegraph Loan of 13 Million Yuan of the East Asia Industrial Company in the 9th Year of the Taisho Period; (6) 20 Million Yuan of the Qingdao Public Property and Salt Production Guarantee Money in the 11th Year of the Taisho Period; In Addition, There Are Military Loans From the Nanjing Government, Clothing Loans From the Ministry of the Army, and Other Loans of 120 Million Yuan, All of Which Have Collateral, but No Interest Has Been Paid in Recent Years, and Even Since the 13th Year of the Taisho Period, Neither Principal Nor Interest Has Been Paid, All of Which Have Been Overdue for a Long Time. Japan Can Take Them at Any Time, but Considering China's Financial Situation, It Has Not Urged Them Seriously, but Recently, There Have Been Frequent Reports That China Has Established Loans With European and American Countries. If This Is the Case, China, Which Lacks Collateral, Cannot Guarantee That It Will Not Use the Collateral to Japan as Double or Triple Collateral, and If the New Loans Are Used as Anti-Japanese Funds, Japan Will Have to Urge China to Liquidate the Loans First. If It Does Not Pay, It Will Only Dispose of the Collateral. The Easiest Thing to Dispose of Is to Confiscate All of China's Wired and Wireless Telegraphs and Telephones With Force. The Army Leaders and the Kwantung Army Are Coordinating and Anticipating the Worst-Case Scenario, and Taking Preventive Measures. (30th day, Dentsu telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Japanese Military Makes Things Difficult for the Takeover of War Zones: <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yao, Ri: The Japanese Military Forces the Security Team to Roll Call in Tangshan, and Openly Makes Unreasonable Demands. The Japanese Military Stationed in Huai Resuses to Take Over Linyu County and Qian'an County, Which are Still Under the Control of the Japanese and the Puppet Regime. Special Dispatch from Tianjin: From the Signing of the Tanggu Truce to Our Side Taking Over the War Zones, Two Months Have Passed. During These Two Months, the Takeover Committee Members Have Been Running Around in the Heat, and Their Situation is Very Difficult. However, the Result of the Takeover is an "Incomplete" Showing, and an Achievement of "Humiliating Patience." This Takeover is Divided into Two Routes: The Eastern Route Consists of Eleven Counties (in Reality, Dushan County is Not Included), and the Northern Route Only Consists of Five Counties (in Reality, Xinglong County is Not Included). The Eastern Route is an Area Where the Japanese and Puppet Armies are Concentrated, and the Situation is Complicated. The Takeover Committee Members Who Believe Optimistically are Blinded by the Situation. Taking Linyu County, Which is Full of Conflicts and Complications, as an Example, Before Liu Shisun Went to Shanhaiguan to Negotiate, He Said That There Were No Problems, and Ordered County Magistrate Yin Shousong to Accompany Him. Yin Did Not Agree to Accompany Him. After Yin Arrived in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, He Repeatedly Telegraphed Urging Yin to Go to Take Over Quickly. Then, on the 26th, a Telegram Suddenly Arrived from Tangshan, Saying That the Japanese Army in Qian'an Had Not Withdrawn and That There Were Many Bandits in the Area, So the Takeover Should Be Postponed. This Was Like a Bolt From the Blue, Which Could Make the Takeover Committee Members Sing a Sentence: "Cold Water Poured on the Head, Embracing Ice!" Therefore, Yin Tong Became Very Anxious and Visited Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Who Still Advocated That the Takeover Personnel Should Proceed as Usual and Not Give Up Because of a Minor Setback. Then, He Took a Special Train to Beiping to Report to Huang Fu and Rushed Back to Tianjin That Night. The Next Morning, He Led the County Magistrates, Public Security Bureau Chiefs, and Auxiliary Personnel to Depart on Two Trains. The Security Team That Boarded the Train at the Tianjin East Station Consisted of 145 People on the First Train and 189 People on the Second Train. When the Special Train Passed Junliangcheng, 2,000 Newly Organized Security Team Members Boarded the Train. They Were All Fully Armed and Attached With Many Light Machine Guns. However, the Security Team Members Were Riding in Open Cars Without Protection From Wind and Rain. The Source of This Security Team is a Reorganized Army, and We Do Not Need to Say It Outright, Because the Japanese Have Already Investigated and Understood It Clearly. The Japanese Regard These Non-Resistant Soldiers as Rotten Wood. Now, Even Though They Have Transformed Into Police, They are Even Less Worth Mentioning. Therefore, the Japanese Side Had No Objections to the Formation of This Security Team. Unexpectedly, the Weather Was Not Good, and It Started to Rain Heavily After the Two Trains Passed Beitang. The 2,000-Odd Security Team Members Stood Erect in the Open Cars, Receiving a Thorough Washing. On the Same Day, They Arrived in Tangshan at 11:00 AM, But the Rain Had Not Stopped. The Japanese Soldiers Prevented the Security Team From Getting Off the Train. At That Time, the Security Team Members' Clothes and Hats Were Soaked, and the Water in the Open Cars Was Up to Their Knees. Then, Takasaki, the Commander of the Railway Line Garrison of the Japanese Kwantung Army Stationed in Tangshan, Asked Yin Tong About the Number of Security Team Members and Weapons. Yin Immediately Asked Dou Xizhe, the Commander of the General Team, to Tell Him the Truth. Takasaki Immediately Ordered Them to Get Off the Train and Roll Call. Dou Xizhe Immediately Refused, Saying That He Had Already Rolled Call When They Boarded the Train, and There Was No Need to Bother Him Again. Takasaki Still Insisted on Getting Off the Train and Rolling Call. Yin Was Afraid That It Would Become a Deadlock and Wanted to Order the Security Team Members to Get Off the Train, Line Up, and Report Their Numbers. Dou, the Commander of the General Team, Insisted That This Was Not Possible. In the End, He Opened a List of Numbers and Gave It to Takasaki to Check the Number of People in Each Car and the Types of Guns in Detail and Record Them. Soon After, He Notified Yin Tong That the Train Taking Over the War Zones Must Leave Today at 1:30 PM and Designated Tangshan, Luanzhou, Changli, and Linyu as the Disembarkation Points for the Takeover Personnel and the Security Team. They Were Not Allowed to Get Off the Train Except at the Designated Locations. His Attitude Was Arrogant and Intimidating, Treating Us Like a Protected Nation. I Don't Know How Those Who Were Bearing the Brunt Could Endure It. However, There Were Even More Embarrassing Things. The Takeover Personnel Went to Jiaotong University in the Rain, Where They Were Introduced to Li Jichun by Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong. Then, They Were Introduced to Song Yeowei, the So-Called Commander of the Japanese Army Stationed in Tangshan of the Northern Ning Railway Garrison Team (I Heard He Was a Detachment Commander). Song Yeowei Immediately Issued a Paper Printed by Wax Paper to Each County Magistrate, Entitled "Matters Required of County Magistrates and Public Security Bureau Chiefs." The Original Text is as Follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding All Administrative Procedures, I Hope That You Will Strictly Abide By the Agreement on the Ceasefire Between China and Japan.</p>
<p>(2) When Each County Magistrate and Public Security Bureau Chief Takes Office, Please Report the Following Matters to Our Team as Soon as Possible (Turn to Commander Song Yeowei in the 14th Mixed Brigade in Shanhaiguan): 1. The Announcement (Two Copies) of Each County Magistrate Taking Office Should Be Sent to Our Team as Soon as Possible (All Announcements Afterwards Should Be Reported Immediately); 2. The Announcement (Two Copies) of Each Public Security Bureau Chief Taking Office Should Be Sent to Our Team as Soon as Possible (All Announcements Afterwards Should Be Reported Immediately); 3. The Arrangement of the Public Security Bureau (Namely, Address, Number of People, Number of Horses, Types of Weapons (Guns), and the Number of Each); 4. The Arrangement of the Police (Namely, Address, Number of People, Number of Horses, Types of Weapons (Guns), and the Number of Each); 5. The Situation of the Local Self-Defense Corps and the Actual Number of Guns].</p>
<p>After Reading the Above Notice, Each Takeover Personnel Was Silent and Made No Expression, Not Knowing Whether They Rejected It or Accepted It. The Reporter Asked Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, for His Opinion on This. Yu Said, "I Always Seek Thoroughness in Handling Affairs. Regarding the Takeover Issue, I Have Always Advocated That All Conflicts and Obstacles Should Be Resolved Thoroughly, and That We Cannot Prevaricate and Accept It Vaguely. The Notice Sent by Song Yeowei to the Takeover Personnel is a Disregard for China's Sovereignty. If It is Reported to the Provincial Government, I Will Completely Reject It." The Special Train for the Takeover Still Drove East From Tangshan at the Limited Time of Takasaki. The Rain Was Getting Heavier. It Arrived in Luanzhou at 3:30 PM. County Magistrate Zhang, Public Security Bureau Chief Meng Xuehan, Leting County Magistrate Guan Gengyu, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Zhigang, and the Security Team Got Off the Train. The Special Train Stopped for Three Hours. The Small Japanese Officer Still Inquired Several Times in the Rain. It Arrived in Changli at 8:00 PM. County Magistrate Liang, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Gang, Dou Xizhe, the Commander of the Security General Team, and the Security Team All Got Off the Train. The Special Train Was Originally Intended to Continue Driving East, But Unexpectedly, the Staff of the Puppet Fengshan Railway Deliberately Made Things Difficult and Did Not Give Them the Road Ticket, So They Could Not Drive the Train. At This Time, There Were Still Thousands of Security Team Members Who Had Not Gotten Off the Train. They Were Exposed to the Wind and Rain and Had Not Eaten for a Day. They Were Already Exhausted. Fortunately, After County Magistrate Liang, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang, and Dou, the Commander of the General Team, Got Off the Train, They Quickly Found a Way to Send Boiled Water, Large Flatbreads, Steamed Buns, and Pickles to Satisfy Their Hunger and Relieve Their Suffering. However, They Could Not Get Off the Train, So They Had No Place to Stay, and They Could Not Change Their Wet Clothes. The Next Morning (the 28th) at 4:00 AM, the Special Train Drove East From Changli. At 5:00 AM, It Arrived in Liushouying. Funing County Magistrate Liu Xingpei, Public Security Bureau Chief Song Ziyou, Lulong County Magistrate Chen Zengshi, Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Fugui, and the Security Team Got Off the Train. At 6:00 AM, It Arrived in Qinhuangdao. At This Time, the Clouds Had Dispersed and the Sky Was Clear, and the Sea Breeze Was Assaulting People, Giving a Great Sense of Autumn. Yin Tong and Yin Shousong Got Off the Train to Contact the Japanese Garrison Headquarters. It So Happened That the Northern Ning Railway Bureau Heard That the Special Train Was Being Obstructed a Lot, So It Also Sent Section Chief Liu to Take a Passenger Car to Catch Up and Negotiate to Drive the Train East. At 7:00 AM, It Arrived in Shanhaiguan. As Soon as the Special Train Pulled Into the Station Platform, a Team of Japanese Military Police and a Team of Puppet State Police Fully Armed Surrounded the Special Train with a Fierce Momentum, Not Allowing the Security Team to Get Off the Train and Wanting to Confiscate Their Weapons. After Several Negotiations, It Was Ultimately Ineffective. Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, Yin Shousong, and Others Went to Visit Naka River, the Commander of the Japanese Army Garrisoning in Yuguan. Naka River Actually Said That the Shanhaiguan Railway Station Already Belonged to the Territory of Manchuria. He Had Not Received an Order Here and Could Not Allow Armed People to Get Off the Train Here. He Hoped That Your Team Would Withdraw Quickly. Moreover, the Linyu County Government Office Has Already Been Moved to Haiyang Town, and Shanhaiguan is No Longer Under the Jurisdiction of Linyu County. Yin, Liu, and Others Went to Visit Hattori Heiji郎, Commander of the 14th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, and His Staff Officer Yazaki. Hattori Expressed It Even More Wonderfully, Saying That Your Place Can Take Over Linyu County Without Any Problems. You Can Go to Haiyang Town to Take Over. However, Shanhaiguan City Has Been Delineated Into the Borderline of Manchuria. There Are Many Troops Stationed Here, and I am Afraid That There Will Be Inconveniences. Apart From This Place, You Can Move Linyu County to Any Place You Want, and I am Willing to Send Commander Naka River to Accompany County Magistrate Yin to Haiyang Town to Take Over. If There Are Any Obstacles, I Am Willing to Be Responsible for Resolving Them. Therefore, the Special Train Returned to Qinhuangdao. It Was Heard That It Was Scheduled to Leave This Morning (the 29th) at 9:00 AM With Naka River Leading a Team of Japanese Soldiers to Accompany County Magistrate Yin and Public Security Bureau Chief Huang Tianmin to Take Over. Whether There Are Any Obstacles, the Provincial Government Has Not Received a Report Until 3:00 PM This Afternoon. However, the Puppet State's Border Guard Line is Set Up at the Shi River, Dividing the Boundaries. People Entering This Borderline Must Be Strictly Searched and Interrogated, and Their Whereabouts Must Be Recorded in Detail Before They Are Allowed to Pass. In the Future, It Will Be Difficult to Set Up the Linyu County Government in Shanhaiguan. It Was Heard That the Telegraph Bureau in Shanhaiguan City Has Been Changed Into a Japanese Restaurant. He Zhuguo's Police Garrison Headquarters Has Been Changed Into the Miyato Detachment of the Japanese Army. The Headquarters of the Hattori Brigade is Stationed in the Private Residence of the Richest Man in Linyu, the Tian Family. The South Gate Tower Has Been Swept Away by Artillery Fire. The Plaque of the First Pass in the World at the East Gate is Still Intact. The Linyu County Government Has Been Replaced by the Puppet Local Maintenance Association. The Girls' School Has Been Stopped, and the Boys' School Continues to Have Classes as Usual. There Are Many Bandits Lurking in the Northeast of the County City, Near the Great Wall. Although Our Security Team Stipulates That Tangshan Should Have Three Squads, Changli, Linyu, and Qian'an Should Each Have Two Squads, and the Remaining Counties Should Each Have One Squad, Qian'an is Still Controlled by the Japanese and Puppet Regime. There is No Definite News on When the Takeover Will Take Place. Even If the Takeover Takes Place in the Future, It Is Very Close to Lengkou, Which Means That the Bandits With a Background are Not Something That Two Security Squads Can Handle. We Are Very Worried About the Change of Power in Linyu and Qian'an. The Counties That Are Currently Taking Over Smoothly Are Only Luan County, Changli, Fengrun, Leting, Yutian, and Ninghe, etc. However, the People of Ninghe Have Mostly Fled, and the County Government Office Has Been Destroyed and Cannot Work. The County Magistrate, Yuan Shibin, Intends to Submit a Request to the Provincial Government to Temporarily Set Up a Government Office in Lutai to Work. (July 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Situation in Chahar is at a Critical Juncture <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Beiping Military Sub-Committee Sent Tu Sizong to Chahar. Feng Still Disagrees with Canceling the Title. All Parties are Paying Close Attention to Sun Dianying's Troops. Special Dispatch from Beiping: The Chahar Problem is Gradually Reaching a Critical Juncture. After the Lushan Conference, Wang and Chiang Have Jointly Issued a Circular Telegram Expressing Their Sincere Concern for Chahar. Tu Sizong, the Representative of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, Was Ordered to Go to Chahar Yesterday to Discuss This Matter. Deng Zhexie, Feng's Representative, Returned to Beiping From Tianjin and Continued to Mediate With Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiong Bin, and Others. The Beiping Authorities Still Hope That Feng Will Cancel the Title of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army Immediately. Deng Has Telegraphed Feng to Report This, But No Reply Has Been Received Today. Xie Zhiru, a Counselor of the Executive Yuan, Took Wang's Letter to Chahar to Meet With Feng and Returned to Beiping Yesterday. It is Reported That There Were No Satisfactory Results. Feng and Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Tong Lin阁, Deng Wen, and Others Have Been Meeting in Zhangjiakou Recently. They Still Find it Difficult to Express Sympathy for the Cancellation of the Title. All the Troops Entering Chahar Have Arrived at the Appropriate Locations. Guan Linzheng is in Charge of the Right Wing, Feng Qinzai's Troops are on the Left Wing, and 　Bingxun Wang Jingjiu's Troops are on the Front. New Troops Have Continued to Arrive in Kangzhuang to Fill the Defense. The 　Family Is in Command in Shacheng. A Telegram Has Arrived in Beiping Clarifying the External Rumors and Expressing That They Only Know How to Obey the Orders of the Central Government and That They Are Not Concerned With Other Things. The Two Armies at the Front Are Very Close to Each Other and Are Preparing for Battle. Although There Are No Special Movements, the Situation is Becoming Increasingly Serious. Sun Dianying Has Arrived in Baotou, and His Troops Are Still in Transit. Most of Them Are Concentrating in the Area of Chaigoubao and Baotou. A Considerable Number of Troops Remain Between Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou. At This Juncture When the Chahar Situation is Undecided, All Parties Are Paying Close Attention to Him. (July 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Chiang Kai-shek's Fundamental Party and Government Reforms for Suppressing the Communists <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Establishing Party and Government Training Institutes and Opening Youth Factories: A dispatch from Nanchang reports that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has established a military officer training corps, the "Climbing Peak Team," at Mount Lu. Classes have already begun. President Wang Jingwei, upon arriving at Mount Lu on the 22nd, immediately visited the military training corps at Haihui Temple, delivering instructions to all. Furthermore, the Party and Government Training Institute established by Chiang is located in Bailudong, where Zhu Xi once lectured. Personnel from the special Party headquarters and political training offices of the Communist suppression efforts in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan have been transferred there for training. Over 1,500 people have already registered. The sole purpose of the training is to cultivate a spirit of perseverance and hard work, enabling them to effectively penetrate and work among the lower strata of the populace in Communist-controlled areas. It is also reported that Wang and Chiang discussed at the Mount Lu conference appropriate measures to reform military institutions, the content of the army, and the training, replenishment, and combat of the Communist suppression forces. The Military Affairs Commission will undertake these reforms.</p>
<p>According to military sources, Chiang, in order to develop production and relieve unemployed youth in the Communist-controlled areas, has decided to open a large-scale factory in Hukou. Zhu Huaibing, director of the Fourth Department of the General Headquarters, has drafted a plan to establish the "Jiangxi Communist Suppression Area Youth Military Factory," which will be funded by the General Headquarters.

<h3 id="e54">Zhao Qilu's Impeachment Case <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Zhenjiang regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Government's appeal to the Government Council: Zhao Qilu, the Director of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, was impeached by Supervisory Committee member Liu San. The Secretariat of the National Government's Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials sent a letter to Director Zhao. In addition to submitting a defense to the committee within the specified time limit, Zhao also submitted the 588th committee report of the provincial government. The report concluded that the provincial government should thoroughly investigate the case, provide a detailed account of the facts, and submit it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, as well as send a letter to the Disciplinary Committee clarifying the truth and responsibilities. The aforementioned submissions were sent separately on the 28th of this month. The original text is divided into four points, totaling approximately six thousand words. The gist of it is that the accusations in the impeachment document against Zhao Qilu, the Director of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, are not only completely contrary to the facts but also illogical. The criticisms can be roughly divided into four points. In summary, the provincial government has a consistent policy regarding the appointment and removal of officials, and the punishment of corruption is carried out in accordance with the central government's intentions. All procedures and processes involved are jointly discussed and decided upon by the provincial government's committee and reported to the Executive Yuan and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The case files are available for review. Director Zhao, as a member of the provincial committee, is only carrying out orders and should not be held solely responsible. However, the impeachment document states that the selection of county magistrates caused social resentment, that the reluctance to easily replace county magistrates induced them to retain their positions, that the punishment of corrupt county magistrates violated the law, and that the promotion of outstanding personnel was undeserved. This implies that the provincial government's actions regarding the appointment, removal, reward, and punishment of county magistrates are all unacceptable. This raises the question of how officials can fulfill their duties and what other paths they should take to be considered legitimate. This is not only impossible in reality but also illogical. Furthermore, it is noted that Supervisory Committee member Liu filed the impeachment based on Wang Qinghe's false accusations, and the Supervisory Yuan's request for disciplinary action was based on the reports of secret investigators. The Director of Civil Affairs is a key national appointee, and violating the law is a serious charge of dereliction of duty. To allow impeachment based on Wang Qinghe's baseless accusations and secret investigators' reports that contradict the facts would set a precedent that would make officials constantly vulnerable to insult and harm. False accusers could freely disrupt and slander without fear, leading to the reversal of right and wrong, the confusion of black and white, and the decline of morality. What kind of government system would that be?</p>
<h3 id="e55">Declaration by Important Communist Party Member Cai Jiantang and Others <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Exposing the Mistakes and Crimes of the Communist Party Based on Awareness, They Joined the Kuomintang: Seven people, including Cai Jiantang, former secretary of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party, issued an anti-communist declaration. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>What is Gained by Fumbling in the Dark Will Always Be Darkness: The Chinese Communist Party is only fumbling and proceeding in the dark. Its ultimate end will only be to create more mistakes and crimes, until it meets its fate of decline and death. We were all once loyal members of the Chinese Communist Party. Now we have resolutely converted to the brilliant banner of the Three Principles of the People. This is not a contradiction or a betrayal of class. This is the harvest we have gained from a painful recollection of fumbling in the dark. This marks the beginning of a new era in our life history.</p>
<p>Our transformation is not accidental. It is based on understanding several fundamental issues:</p>
<h3 id="e56">1. What Kind of Country is China? <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>No one can deny that China is an economically backward country. In a poor and weak country, there are only the very poor and the less poor. There is no fundamental class antagonism to speak of. This basic understanding is enough to defeat Marx's theory of class struggle without residue. Communism, which is not suitable for China's national conditions, has been brought to China, resulting in China becoming even more poor and weak. It cannot create production, but rather destroys production. In fact, this is the case. The Chinese Communist Party has never done any work to create production. It has completely devoted itself to the violent acts of destroying production.</p>
<h3 id="e57">2. Do We Need National Rejuvenation or Fundamentally Reject National Concepts? <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Whether it is the Italian nation, the Germanic nation, the Yamato nation, or even the Slavic nation, these self-improving nations have all been able to develop national self-confidence and national independence. Looking back at our Chinese nation, it is like a plate of loose sand, precisely the result of a lack of national self-confidence and national independence. At present, China's national crisis is very serious. Uniting together to resist Japan is the only good plan to save China and rejuvenate the nation. However, the Chinese Communist Party has proposed the opposition of the lower-level united front and the national united front, such as instigating anti-Japanese soldiers to kill anti-Japanese officers. The heroic sacrifice and bloody battles around the Great Wall were originally for the survival of the nation, but the Communist Party exhausted its ability to sabotage the rear, even colluding with the Japanese side to contain anti-Japanese military operations. The madness of the Chinese Communist Party shows that it has no national concept, and everything is based on the will of the Slavic nation. Without a national concept, how can one speak of revolution? It is simply a parasite of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e58">3. Is the Initial Victory in One or Several Provinces Feudal Separatism? <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>China is currently facing an extremely serious national crisis. What is needed is the unity of national strength. Whoever tries to split national strength is the common enemy of the Chinese nation. The central government is committed to resolving internal disputes in order to overcome the national crisis. Anyone who hinders the unity of national strength will be given the central government's painstaking consideration in order to find a political solution. During this period of national crisis, the Chinese Communist Party may not want to resist Japan, but the Soviet territory of one or several provinces cannot be given up. Their destruction of unity is the same as general feudal separatism. However, its danger is more than ten or a hundred times greater. The Northeast has fallen to Japanese imperialism, and success in the Soviet territory is tantamount to being a dependency of Soviet Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e59">4. Is the Chinese Communist Party Increasingly Developing or Increasingly Collapsing? <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>From the speculation of the erroneous political line of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be affirmed that it will inevitably collapse. From the current situation of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be proved that this affirmation is completely correct. Lines are changed one after another, mistakes are constantly repeated, and the needs of the Chinese revolution are not understood at all. Of course, they will be indecisive and eventually become unmanageable. The Chinese Communist Party, despite its arbitrary propaganda and chanting of the arrival of the revolutionary climax, is actually only deceiving itself. Reviewing the Communist Party's activities over the years, it has exhausted its disruptive role everywhere. The red areas are desolate, the huts are kilns, and the rural economy is completely bankrupt. Even in non-red areas, it has exerted its destructive means. However, once poisoned by the Communist Party, the public's hatred of the Communist Party has deepened, and the Communist Party's organizational strength has been weakened. This is the inevitable result of its political bankruptcy. The Shanghai Party, which the Communist Party boasts as being advanced, is not only pitifully weak in organization, but also most of the workers, the so-called class of the Communist Party itself, are unwilling to be used by it. However, the Communist Party insists that it is confident in winning over the majority of workers. The development of the organization, the September 18th and January 28th calls, with party members claiming four or five thousand, are nothing more than desperate struggles and bluster. The actual number of party members is less than several hundred. The mass base is even more unknown. Defection of party members has become a trend, leaving the Communist Party with nothing to do but cover up its collapsing state. The ironclad facts are clearly laid out before people. The Chinese Communist Party has embarked on the road to death.</p>
<h3 id="e60">5. Who is the Sole Leader of the Chinese Revolution? <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The road of the Bolsheviks, the facts tell us that this road is impassable. There is no doubt that only the Three Principles of the People can save China at present. The Three Principles of the People instruct us that national self-determination is needed to break away from the status of a semi-colonial country, that we must establish a truly popular revolutionary regime, and that we must solve the people's livelihood problems in accordance with China's national conditions, with the correct method of regulating capital and equalizing land rights. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood repeatedly explained the morbid Marxist theory and established the philosophical basis of the historical view of the people's livelihood. We firmly believe that only the great Three Principles of the People is the only doctrine that can save China, and the Chinese Kuomintang, which implements the revolution of the Three Principles of the People, is the only revolutionary party that leads the Chinese revolution.</p>
<p>Recognizing the current stage of history and advancing along the axis of history, we have resolutely transformed from the camp of the Bolsheviks to the banner of the Three Principles of the People. We believe that this is a great transformation.</p>
<p>We deeply know that the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League who are still wandering in the dark are full of pain and feel that there is no way out. We earnestly hope that they will quickly transform from a political and personal bloody lesson and bravely stand on the front line of the Three Principles of the People's revolution, and work together towards a bright future. Cai Jiantang, Xian Daqi, Du Yueying, Wang Lubing, Xu Xian, Zhao Yingchun, He Bengen. July 24th.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Lu and Han Order County Magistrates Along the River to Move to the Embankment to Supervise Construction <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>They May Not Return to the County Without Approval: A dispatch from Jinan reports that when the Yellow River surged last year and the situation was precarious, Chairman Han Fuju, in order to protect the lives and property of millions of people along the river, ordered the county magistrates along the river to move to the embankment to supervise the construction. All officers and soldiers and laborers worked together, and fortunately, the river was safe. This year, the danger of the Yellow River is even greater than last year. As of recently, the river has been rising wildly, and the water level is not much different from the highest water level last year, and in some places, it has exceeded it. Because the water source is still strong, it is expected that there will be a large surge around the beginning of autumn. In addition to the River Affairs Bureau raising the embankment and supervising the officers and soldiers to repair it, Chairman Han today also ordered the twenty-two county magistrates along the river to move to the embankment immediately due to the repeated rise in water and the tense construction situation. The county magistrates are ordered to supervise the laborers to work with the river workers and soldiers day and night to protect the embankment, so as to ensure that there is no danger. They must be stationed at the construction site for at least one week. If the water recedes and the construction is stable, they may return to the county after submitting a report for approval. The river water situation is slightly stable today (July 28th). The upstream Lishangtun has slightly decreased, the middle reaches have increased, and the downstream water level is stable. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, and Zhao Luren, chief of the General Affairs Section, went to Luokou by car this morning to inspect the river construction situation and returned in the afternoon. According to them, the water situation is still stable, and although the water is large in the middle reaches, there is no change. The water level table for each section of the river today is as follows: Lishangtun in the upper reaches, down three centimeters, water level 58 meters 3 inches; Guanzhuang in the middle reaches up 1.2 centimeters, water level 35 meters 9 inches 1 point (exceeding the highest water level last year); Luokou up 1.5 centimeters, water level 30 meters 0 inches 5 points (only 5 centimeters lower than the highest water level last year); Scorpion Bay in the lower reaches, up 7 centimeters, water level 18 meters 2 inches 7 points; Dama House is level, water level 14 meters 3 inches.

<h3 id="e62">Family Dispute in the Songjiang Xi Family Tragedy <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the tragic death case of Xi Yongda, the chairman of the Huayangqiao Xi Yongda Rice Shop, and his wife Tu Quanxi, the surviving young sons, Shichang and Shirong, are both minors. An ad hoc relatives' meeting was immediately established, and their maternal uncles, Tu Xinnong and Tu Wenjie, were appointed as guardians. Xi Weisheng, Xi Weibin, Xu Chunbo, and Shen Lichu were appointed as supervisors of the guardians. Gu Shouyi and Tu Heyun were hired as lawyers to manage the estate and provide legal protection for the two young sons. During this process, the guardian supervisor Xi Weibin tore up a promissory note for 2,000 yuan and made various threats, preventing the guardians from performing their duties. Furthermore, the previous day, a threatening letter signed "Qiyouzi One" was received, stating that after the deaths of Xi Weiquan and his wife, the post-mortem affairs should be managed by the Xi clan. However, because the two sons are young, a relatives' meeting has been formed, but it is only a formal guarantee. If outsiders want to participate, there is no shortage of people in Huayangqiao who are well aware of the matter, so there is no need for outside interference. If they still do not understand in the future, they will be dealt with in appropriate ways, so as not to involve Weiquan's son, who will follow in his father's footsteps, and that they are also quite dangerous, so they should let go as soon as possible. In order to protect the interests of the wards, the Tu brothers took the two sons home on the 25th and sent the boxes of documents to lawyer Gu for safekeeping in another place to avoid other changes. They also notified all members of the relatives' meeting. However, the guardian supervisor Xi Weisheng was very dissatisfied with this move, which was not discussed in advance and was a decisive action. He also entrusted lawyer Lu Longxiang to make a statement on his behalf. The dispute may be just beginning.</p>

<p>Liuhhe, Taicang, is a place where official salt is produced. A few days ago, the local Salt Guild had over ten thousand yuan of salt, which was divided into nine large boats and transported to Zhenjiang, Dantu, Yaojiaqiao, and other places for unloading. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 on the 28th, the salt boats passed through Yangcheng Lake Mouth in the county, and one boat fell behind, resulting in a robbery. The boat was carrying a total of 1,050 packages of salt, of which more than 300 packages were robbed (each package priced at 6 yuan). When the bandits came, they were on two boats, carrying about twenty bandits, all in white shirts and yellow trousers, and holding four box guns and many rifles. After the incident, the boat crew landed and reported the robbery to the Xiangcheng District Office to request an arrest. Although the security regiment dispatched to search, they found nothing. Currently, two of the boat crew members are injured and have been admitted to Xiangcheng Hospital.</p>

<p>Bai Ruilin, a farmer in Zhangjia Village near Zhahe Bridge west of Wuyi County, has several acres of melon fields, and his eighteen-year-old eldest son, Zhang Tinggen, watches the melons in the fields day and night. Unexpectedly, Wu Zhaorong and Wu Pangliu, villagers in the same village, went to steal melons during the day and were spotted by Zhang Tinggen, who confronted them. Wu and others not only did not admit it, but beat Tinggen, hitting his vital point, causing him to be seriously injured and fall to the ground. His father found out and carried him back for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died on the evening of the 28th. Bai Ruilin was saddened by the death of his son. In addition to handing over the two murderers to the local bailiff for custody, he submitted a report to the county court on the 29th. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi went to the countryside on the 30th to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e69">The First National Government Construction Lottery Will Be Drawn Today <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>At one o'clock this afternoon, a plane will scatter flowers at Yiyuan to welcome the public for free viewing. The top prize will definitely be drawn from sold numbers. Starting from the 8th, the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, handled by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, will be drawn in public at Yiyuan on Albert Road in the French Concession at 1:00 PM today. There will be quite a lively scene. According to the announcement, there are 667 winning numbers from the first prize to the seventh prize, which will take about seven hours to draw completely. In order to save time, all ceremonies will be simplified. Approximately after the China National Aviation Corporation sends a specially assigned plane to the arena to scatter flowers and colored streamers, the lottery will begin. The Yiyuan address is large and can accommodate more than 10,000 spectators. The Construction Lottery is related to national construction. The lottery office will not pre-issue admission tickets for the first lottery drawing, and welcomes people from all walks of life to come to the arena to watch freely and participate in the grand event together. Furthermore, the lottery prizes were originally scheduled to be paid directly by the lottery office. In order to facilitate the prize winners to collect their prizes, the office has specially entrusted the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and their branches in various places, to handle the payment on their behalf. The effective period for prize payment is from August 8th of this year to January 31st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. It is also reported that the Ministry of Finance, because a portion of the first lottery tickets has not yet been sold out, in order to maintain the rights of the ticket buyers and consolidate national credit, the government has specially approved that the first prize must be drawn from the sold lottery ticket numbers. The method is as follows: If the first prize is first drawn from the sold lottery ticket numbers, there is no problem. If the first prize is first drawn from the lottery ticket numbers retained by the Ministry of Finance, in addition to issuing the prize money for the last two digits and the last one digit that are the same as this number, the government will give up the 500,000 yuan first prize money that this number itself should have received, and give it to the ticket buyers. After all the prizes have been drawn today, another drawing will be held on the spot. In any case, it will be drawn from the sold lottery ticket numbers. However, the prize money for the last two digits or one digit that are the same will still be issued in accordance with the first prize number.</p>

<p>The Qinghai Branch Line Will Be Tested Next Month, and the Eurasian Joint Flight is Still Undetermined. Li Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai by plane yesterday after going to Beiping due to his mother's illness. According to him, the Northwest Aviation Qinghai Branch Line has now been changed to depart for a test flight in the middle of next month (August). He was unable to conduct the test flight as scheduled last time because he returned to Beiping to visit his parents due to his mother's illness. Now that his mother's illness has slightly improved, he immediately returned to Shanghai. After making some arrangements in Shanghai, he will depart in the middle of next month. As for the implementation of the Eurasia joint flight, there are no problems on the foreign side. The only difference is that if there are no problems on the domestic side, it can be started at any time. Also, the entire line between Shanghai and Dihua is about 4,000 kilometers long, and the round-trip flights have excellent results. The route between Dihua and Tacheng is only 500 kilometers. There is no problem in implementing joint flights. The problem on the domestic side is the communication of Dihua's radio. If Dihua's radio can communicate, there will be no other problems in the future, and the joint flight can be realized. Therefore, before the problems on the domestic route are resolved, it is difficult to determine when the joint flight can begin. The statement that it will begin on August 1st is completely unfounded.</p>

<p>The First Sounding Work is Completed: A Central News Agency report states that the preparations for the construction of a large oriental port have been carried out by the Preparatory Committee for the Construction of a Large Oriental Port, together with the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, to sound the seabed topography and coastline. The first sounding work has been completed. In order to expedite and complete this work, re-sounding has now begun. After the re-sounding is completed, three more soundings are required to produce a blueprint, which will be studied before construction begins. However, according to the sounders, the port is subject to very large waves due to its location, which has a significant impact on the berthing of ships. Therefore, it is necessary to build a breakwater to reduce the force of the waves.</p>

<p>Distressed Overseas Chinese in Mexico Urgently Need Relief: Overseas Chinese in Japan Will Return to China on a Regular Basis: Mexico has been affected by the global economic downturn, resulting in a gradual increase in domestic unemployment. Seeing that overseas Chinese in China run small and medium-sized businesses and occupy a dominant position, they have disregarded diplomatic relations between the two countries and organized an anti-Chinese party to exclude overseas Chinese, rob property, and expel them. The distressed overseas Chinese who have been expelled back to China in succession are in twelve batches, about 2,000 people. There are still more than 10,000 people who cannot return to China due to a lack of travel funds. At the same time, overseas Chinese in Osaka, Nagasaki, and other places in Japan have been excluded, resulting in unemployment. They will return to China on a regular basis. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to Peng Canguang, the general manager of the Overseas Chinese General Association, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, when Chinese overseas Chinese in Mexico were unable to bear the oppression, they all smuggled into the United States. The U.S. authorities knew that the Chinese overseas Chinese were refugees and were extremely generous, issuing each person 100 U.S. dollars for travel expenses to send them back to China. The distressed overseas Chinese relied on this to return to their homeland. Recently, as the anti-Chinese wave in Mexico is still fierce, the number of overseas Chinese fleeing into the United States is still on the way. In order to make up for the losses, it has negotiated with the Mexican government to bear the travel expenses, but it has been rejected. Therefore, the U.S. authorities immediately ordered the border police to stop the smuggling of overseas Chinese to avoid huge and undeserved losses.</p>

<p>Since the U.S. government ordered a ban on smuggling, there are now tens of thousands of distressed overseas Chinese in a dilemma. They have no way to escape and no way to appeal. If no measures are taken to provide relief as soon as possible, they will be stranded in a foreign country. The consequences are unimaginable. Although the government has remitted 50,000 yuan to the minister in Mexico to provide assistance, it is a drop in the bucket and not enough to distribute. It is hoped that the government authorities will continue to provide assistance to save the innocent. According to Peng, a report has been received that more than 70 distressed overseas Chinese who entered the country before the ban on smuggling were detained and have been approved by the U.S. government to be sent back to China. However, the date of departure is still unknown.</p>

<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Chinese overseas Chinese in Japan have been subjected to exclusion by the Japanese side. Recently, the anti-Chinese wave in Dalian, Nagasaki, and other places has been even worse than before, resulting in a large number of overseas Chinese being forced to lose their jobs. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to welcome the overseas Chinese back to China to avoid being stranded. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 7,000 yuan to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to handle the relief matters. It is learned that there are currently about 300 overseas Chinese in Nagasaki, who are scheduled to return to China on the Changxing Company's Queen Asia Wheel on the 11th of next month. It is expected that they will arrive at the port on the 13th. Most of the above-mentioned overseas Chinese are from Fujian, Guangdong, and North China provinces. After arriving in Shanghai, they will be sent back to their places of origin separately.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Ministry of Industries to Formulate a Plan to Deal with Trade with Russia <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Organize an Inspection Group and Set Up a Special Bureau Based on the Principle of Mutual Benefit and No Damage to Our Country's Commerce, According to New News Agency. The Soviet Russian government, in view of the increasingly busy commercial relations between the two countries since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, has specially sent Commercial Commissioner Komarov to China to investigate the state of our country's commerce as a reference for the development of Russian goods in the Chinese market. It also plans to establish a joint Sino-Russian commercial company in Tianjin with a capital of 8 million to 15 million yuan, specializing in import and export trade between the two countries. All these matters have been reported in the newspapers. A reporter from the New News Agency believes that the organization of this joint venture company is of great importance to the future of our country's trade with Russia, and therefore specially inquired of industrial circles and exporters for their opinions on this matter. All agreed that although there has been news of the Russian government sending Commercial Commissioner Komarov to China to investigate commerce, the industrial authorities have not yet received a formal report of when Komarov will depart from Russia. Therefore, it is not yet known whether he is being dispatched by the Russian government or is conducting a personal investigation. As for the establishment of a joint Sino-Russian commercial company in Tianjin, although no report has been received, this matter is of great importance to our entire trade. The Ministry of Industry has formulated a detailed plan to prepare for it, the principle of which is based on mutual benefit and no damage to our country's commerce. As for the official and commercial joint organization of a Soviet Russian industrial inspection group and the establishment of a special bureau for trade with Russia, the plans were temporarily delayed due to the incident of Soviet Russia selling the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the Ministry of Industry is now doing its best to plan so that it can be realized as soon as possible, so that our country's trade with Russia can gradually develop and consolidate the foundation of competition.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sichuan Native Place Association Presents Opinions on Sichuan Administration <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Presented to the Government Authorities by Telegraph. The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai recently sent a telegram to the government authorities, which read: Urgent. To Chairman Lin of Nanjing, Committee Chairman Jiang of Lushan, and President Wang, We humbly present our suggestions for eliminating the Sichuan war, which have been adopted by the authorities, demonstrating the government's concern for the western border. However, the Sichuan war has been going on for several days, and there is no hope for peace. The suffering of the people is becoming more and more urgent. Our association mourns the devastation of our homeland and the suffering of the people's livelihood, and therefore presents concrete measures to stabilize the situation in Sichuan. We earnestly request the government authorities to decide on and implement them during the Lushan Conference. It is well known that the Sichuan army is complex, there have been years of internal strife, Sichuan's administration is corrupt, and the people are living in misery. Therefore, the way to save Sichuan is to distinguish between the urgency of military, political, economic, and educational policies, and to set the essential measures to treat the symptoms and the root causes, and to order their implementation with the authority of the government, punishing violations with national law without any leniency, so that the future of Sichuan Province may have a glimmer of hope. First, the method of treating the symptoms in the military aspect is to unify command and streamline tactics. Please order the Bandit Suppression Commander Liu Xiang to lead the various armies to northern Sichuan to clear the communist bandits within a time limit to protect the people's livelihood and secure the villages. Also, order Liu Wenhui, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Xikang, to consolidate the Kangzang border defense and prevent the Dalai Lama from invading, so as to relieve the central government's concerns in the west. The method of treating the root cause is that Sichuan Province has 500,000 mercenaries and 2 million militia. After bandit suppression and border defense are completed, demobilization should begin. Except for a very small number of troops stationed in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kangding, and other places, the remaining soldiers should be demobilized. Local security should be the responsibility of the 2 million militia, which is more than sufficient. Second, the method of treating the symptoms in the political aspect is to break the defense zone system and carefully select the provincial chairman. If the defense zone is not broken, the division of territory will eventually become the source of all evils, which are difficult to eliminate. If the chairman is not carefully appointed to win the hearts of the people and seek the greatest happiness for our 70 million people, then orders will not be issued from the provincial capital, and disputes will arise. The method of treating the root cause is to establish a provincial legislative body as soon as possible based on the National Reconstruction Program, organized by representatives of agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, and other vocational groups, and various people's groups outside Sichuan, to supervise the administration, formulate the provincial constitution, and enter the path of true democracy. Third, the method of treating the symptoms in the economic aspect is to effectively abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and prohibit the pre-collection of grain taxes. In recent years, Sichuan Province has experienced the most severe exploitation in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. According to the investigation of this association, the pre-collection of grain taxes is as many as thirteen times a year, and the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are as few as more than 20 types per county. Even the lowest-level peddlers and hawkers in society pay an average of more than 10 yuan per year. The communist surge is well-founded. The method of treating the root cause is to revitalize the rural economy and restore export trade. Today's Sichuan economy has become a phenomenon of having villages without agriculture and having imports without exports. The blood is dry and the bones are damaged. If we do not try our best to save it and revive the remnants, then Jiangxi's situation will be a matter of time. Fourth, the method of treating the symptoms in the educational aspect is to strictly select educational administrative personnel and increase national education funds. Education bureaucrats, warlords and academic tycoons should not lead the education bureau, because it will defile the sacred cause of the foundation of the country. The funding for national universities should be increased and used effectively to enrich the content of the highest institution of learning in the southwest. The method of treating the root cause is to make educational funding independent and implement universal education in various counties. The educational funding in Sichuan Province was originally set at more than 4 million from the meat tax of each county, but the military intercepted it, causing education to go bankrupt. In the future, it should be handed over to the Education Department for unified planning and expenditure. Although the implementation of universal education in various counties is more difficult, since Sichuan Province is large and rich, as long as the countryside is revived and exploitation is reduced, funding will not be a problem. The above four points are the preliminary measures to stabilize the situation in Sichuan. Without this, there is no way to talk about construction, and it is even more difficult to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. Our association, based on the righteousness of respecting our homeland, presents our humble opinions and hopes that the government authorities will adopt and implement them. Those who see and sing praises will not only be our association. In a rush by telegram, we await orders. The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai kowtows and stamps.</p>

They also proposed that Yu Qiaqing organize a Guo Coal Shipping Promotion Office. Lu Zuofu and others accepted the proposals and promised to find ways to promote their realization. According to what Lu Zuofu told the National News Agency reporter, "I am engaged in the operation of 11 types of mines in Sichuan, including gold, coal, iron, asbestos, mica, and stone, and have also established several factories, as well as shipping companies, mine transport trains, and other businesses. Sichuan has abundant mountains and minerals, but due to years of war, various businesses cannot be fully developed and are even affected by it. At the same time, the rural economy in various parts of the country is declining, transportation is not smooth, and there is the added problem of communist bandits and foreign aggression, which has a great impact on the domestic industrial sector. This time I came to Shanghai to inspect the Minsheng Industrial Company that I founded and to investigate the sales and transportation of Guo Coal in Shanghai, so as to facilitate the promotion of coal mines produced in Sichuan." During the banquet, drinks were exchanged and the banquet ended happily at about 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association previously sent Director Hu Zusun north to inspect the situation at the front, visit important figures in North China, and meet Feng Yuxiang in Chahar Province. Hu has completed his mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning via Hankou. A reporter from the Daily News met with Hu yesterday and learned that the trip had passed through the provinces of Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar, and the people's morale was good. Han Fuqu's administration in Shandong was particularly well-received. He met with Feng Yuxiang in Chahar, who expressed his unwavering determination to resist Japan. When Feng captured Dolon, he had already returned to Beiping. It is expected that Li Cishan, the standing director of the association who was previously sent north, will return to Shanghai after the weather cools down.</p>

<p>The Rise and Fall of the Righteous Army is Related to the Survival of the Northeast. Please Provide Assistance Quickly. The Daily News Shanghai Dispatch. Since the Jilin Righteous Army rose up from the green gauze tent, the various routes and divisions have been extremely active, inflicting great punishment on the Japanese puppet troops. Yesterday, Mr. Wu Yicheng, the acting commander of the Wang Delin Department of Jilin, specially sent adjutant Wang to Shanghai via a roundabout route with a handwritten letter to report the battle situation to various organizations in Shanghai and request assistance. The original letter read: (Omitted above) Our headquarters has now stationed in Nanhutou, and ordered Staff Captain Zhou Baozhong to stay behind in Anhua, responsible for guiding the western guerrilla warfare. The Sixth Route Army, the Chuan Luo troops, the Independent First Regiment, and other troops are very active on the Jihai, Jichang, and Jidun lines, demolishing railways, destroying bridges, and attacking stations, causing the Japanese army to run around. On June 29, the rebel army of Wang Zhao's southern department, with more than 1,000 men, engaged in a fierce battle with our headquarters in Dunhua, and was defeated by us. Our army immediately mobilized a mixed team to track and pursue, and also attacked Nanhutou fiercely. The enemy stubbornly resisted for four days, but our side suffered very little loss due to the superior terrain. The Japanese rebel army suffered more than 100 casualties, and our army also captured a lot of spoils. As for Suining and both sides of the Chinese Eastern Railway, our Liu Shunqing and Jinshan troops are elusive, which is indeed a hidden worry for the Japanese army. In the Yanwang area, our commando team has made great progress, controlling the key points of the Ji-Hui Road. Longjing Village, which the Japanese have managed for many years, was also completely destroyed by us. However, the Japanese are actively preparing to eliminate the Righteous Army, planning to build the Tuhai Road (from Tumen to Hailin Station) and complete it within a time limit, so as to cut off the Eastern Railway and make it useless, and facilitate the connection and transportation to Korea. At the same time, they are concentrating their forces and advancing in several directions, launching a large-scale offensive against our army, in order to clear the rear. The news of the Japanese army's actions in Dunhua, Ningan, Yanji, Wangqing, Emu, and other places is like dust rising. Our army is on alert, sleeping with weapons by our sides day and night. The war will break out soon. However, since the beginning of the year, we have experienced many battles, and the ammunition consumption has been very large, and the combat effectiveness has been reduced. Once an emergency occurs, the outcome is self-evident. Ammunition purchase is easy, but economic difficulties are helpless. In a month's time, if a large sum of money is not quickly remitted and a corresponding solution is sought, our headquarters will suffer a major blow, or even disintegrate. The rise and fall of our army is related to the survival of the Northeast. Please find a way to provide relief quickly. (Omitted below).</p>

<p>The United Association of Various Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees previously rented houses in Caishou Lane, Julida Road, to settle the family members of the Su Bingwen Department. Now all the family members of the Su Department have been sent north to return to their hometowns.

The association has decided to move all the family members of the Wang Department to the houses in Caishou Lane, Julida Road, where the family members of the Su Department lived, on August 2. After Wang Delin arrives in Shanghai, they will find a way to send them back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>Since the organization of the Bereaved Family Support Association of Fallen Anti-Japanese Soldiers, it has been actively conducting fundraising to prepare for support. Recently, the association has received letters from various parties requesting the allocation of pensions for relief. It is learned that the association, due to the small amount of funds raised, plans to submit a request to the central government in the coming days, requesting the allocation of funds to relieve the bereaved families of fallen anti-Japanese soldiers, so as to comfort the loyal souls. It also requests the central government to establish a school for the bereaved families of fallen anti-Japanese soldiers, so that all the bereaved families of fallen soldiers who fought against Japan at the front after the September 18 Incident can enter the school free of charge.</p>

<p>Telegraph to the Central Government Requesting Exemption from Business Tax. The Joint Association of Rice Businesses in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Other Cities and Counties in Jiangsu Province will convene a representative conference of rice merchants from 61 counties in Jiangsu Province in Shanghai at 2 pm today to discuss important issues in the rice industry. Previously, the association sent letters to various counties, requesting them to send representatives to attend and discuss the issues. Therefore, representatives from Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Suzhou, Danyang, Liyang, Dantu, Changzhou, Shanghai, and other counties have reported one after another. The various proposals have also been reviewed and compiled. Yesterday, the association telegraphed the three central administrative, financial, and industrial agencies, requesting a temporary exemption from the rice and grain business tax, in order to help the merchants of Jiangsu and consolidate the foundation of the country. (Address omitted) According to the reports submitted by the rice industry associations of various counties, our country has always been known as a country of agricultural products. In recent years, we have suffered from floods, droughts, and huge fires, which have led to the decline of people's livelihood and the suffering of farmers and merchants. The devastation of foreign rice has caused rice prices to plummet and suffer a setback. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the social finance has suddenly become dry. If we do not plan to remedy it, the collapse is worrying. Food is related to the needs of the people's livelihood. Zhejiang Province has never levied taxes, and even the business tax has been waived. It is deeply known that the taxation of food, although directly levied on merchants, is still indirectly taken from farmers. Jiangsu Province is also under the Qing and Bai banners, but it is uniquely burdened. How can this be said to be fair? We specially request you to telegraph the government, thinking that the rise and fall of the food industry is related to the governance of the country. We should pray that the business tax will be temporarily exempted, leaving a line of life for farmers and merchants. The affiliated association has learned from the rice industry associations of various counties that our country has always been known as an agricultural country. In recent years, we have suffered from floods, droughts, and huge fires, which have led to the decline of people's livelihood and the suffering of farmers and merchants. The devastation of foreign rice has caused rice prices to plummet and suffer a setback. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the social finance has suddenly become dry.

We specially request you to telegraph the government, thinking that the rise and fall of the food industry is related to the governance of the country. We should pray that the business tax will be temporarily exempted, leaving a line of life for farmers and merchants. I have checked Article 10 of the Central Business Tax Law, which stipulates that the original tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, and other business taxes that should be abolished or prohibited in various provinces and cities may be changed to business tax according to the original tax rate. Then our industry is a type of tooth tax that should be paid for opening a shop. Why do the tax collection agencies in various counties of Jiangsu Province collect business tax in addition to the original tooth tax for the rice industry? This is obviously a violation of the central government's regulations and increases the burden on merchants. At a time when foreign rice is competing and dumping, and the prices of domestic agricultural products are falling monthly, farmers and merchants are in trouble and cannot maintain their livelihoods. How can the melon of Huangtai be picked again? We specifically telegraph and request you to order that the rice and grain business tax be temporarily exempted until the customs has not implemented the collection of taxes to resist the dumping of foreign rice. Even if it must be collected in the future, it should still be changed to business tax according to the original tooth tax in accordance with Article 10 of the Central Business Tax Law, and should not be interpreted曲加,重增米业负担. 以苏商困,而固国本,实为德便.

<h3 id="e90">The Joint Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Association Decides to Telegraph to Cancel the Fisheries Construction Fee <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Since the Joint Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Associations held a meeting of member representatives, the work has been extremely tense. Yesterday, another meeting of initiator representatives was held to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, appealing that the association believes that Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei are using US cotton loans solely to provide relief to farmers, and should not be used for other purposes. Their concern for the people's livelihood is very deep. However, since the dispute over the collection of construction fees occurred in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang fisheries industry, it has been mediated repeatedly without resolution, causing fishermen and fish merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to suffer from the harassment and extortion of the collection office staff every day. They are in distress and have nowhere to tell. After the bankruptcy of the rural areas, it is followed by the bankruptcy of the fisheries industry. The production industry is already in a state of recession. Therefore, the meeting of initiators decided to draft a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, detailing the past and present situation, and immediately cancel the fisheries construction fee in order to help the people of Jiangsu. The text is about 1,000 words long. After the text is revised, it is scheduled to be sent out today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Reaction to the Rumor The Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office announced that the collection of construction fees would be handled in accordance with the regulations and has not been slow in progress. Someone spread rumors, saying that the collection office would be canceled. After the office sent a letter to the local government to deal with the rumor-mongers in accordance with the law, Mr. Hu Diansun, the person in charge of the office, told the New News Agency reporter yesterday that since the collection office opened on April 15, due to the occurrence of collection disputes, the office has only collected once from a very small number of merchants in this city due to various reasons. The other industries have not paid. Therefore, the office has been in a state of stagnation. As for the cancellation of the collection office, it was first filed by Yu Qiaqing, a member of the Reform Association and a mediator, for the approval of the Ministry. Then, it was confirmed by the talk of Lin Kanghou, a member of the Reform Association. The office is a branch office under the Reform Committee. Then who is spreading rumors and who is spreading rumors is self-evident. The office's statement is truly what is called "cutting feet to fit shoes."</p>
<p>Denial of the Meng Representative Fang Junwenyin, the representative of the Shaoxing Southern Goods Industry Association in Shanghai, told the New News Agency reporter that Meng Lujiu only represents the Hangzhou Ham, Pickled Meat, and Fish Industry Association. During the mediation, he falsely claimed to represent the eight prefectures of Hangjiahu, Shaoxing, Jin, Quzhou, Yan, and Chu. Not to mention other places, as far as this office is concerned, after the Ningbo Fresh and Salted Fish Industry Association sent personnel to notify us, our association sent Yu, Zhu Zhichuan, Lei Shouchang, and Chu Zhangwei to Shanghai a few days ago to participate in the meeting of the joint office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Associations, declaring everything to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>In this year's National Goods Year, the Shanghai Citizens National Goods Promotion Association, in order to inspire the deep-seated concept of compatriots to use national goods, in addition to widely recruiting members to rectify the association's affairs, is also stepping up the work of promoting and selling national goods, leading various manufacturers to participate in national goods mobile exhibitions in various places, hoping to rely on material publicity to achieve the goal of self-production and self-sufficiency. The Qingdao National Goods Exhibition co-organized by the association this time has been well-received by the citizens of Qingdao due to the proper publicity and complete organization of the authorities. The exhibition results are very good. It is estimated that no less than 40,000 people visit and purchase every day. There are also many foreign nationals who come to the exhibition to purchase. Therefore, the total sales volume averages more than 20,000 yuan per day. It is learned that Mayor Shen of the city and Mr. Ding Jingchen of the Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that盛会不常,一旦展覧闭幕,各工厂因以星散,深恐民众服用国货之热心,渐趋冷淡,爰就原址,改设靑岛国货公司,藉建推销国货之基础,并作该会永远之纪念. 近悉上海市民提倡国货会,除会同筹备该公司事宜与参加举行八月五日开幕之威海卫国展会(定八月一日装货,二日上午八时,乘新丰轮出发)外,近复接福建建设厅来函,以闽省自蒋蔡二将军到任以后,目睹洋货充斥,国产被弃痛愤之余,特令建厅划拨巨款,举办大规模国货展覧会,俾民众得入改用国货之途,经邀请上海各工厂在该会领导之下,共同前往参加,建厅方面,为谋就近接洽便利起见,特派史家麟君代表来沪,接治筹备,昨经上海市商会·上海市民提倡国货会·中华国货维持会·各派代表朱伯元·徐缄若·汪星一·君等,与史代表会商结果,订定本年双十节开幕,假闽省西湖公园为会址,上海装货,定于十月二日,商请招商局三北公司,特放专轮赴闽,免税手续,亦已晋亦办理,省当局为优待参加计,对于会场电灯宣传宿舍等费,概由建厅负担,因此沪上各工厂赴上海市民提倡国货会登记者,络绎不绝云.</p>

<p>The National News Agency reports that the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Federation of Commerce, acting on a previous confidential report that the Yifeng Enamel Factory in this city was secretly importing enemy goods, dispatched personnel along with the Shanghai Enamel Industry Association to conduct a thorough investigation. The report indicated that since the September 18th Incident, the factory has not purchased any enemy goods. Furthermore, the Industry Association certified that the factory has, over the years, created domestic materials such as enamel powder, printing paper, crucibles, kilns, and fire bricks, which were supplied to various domestic goods manufacturers to replace enemy goods. Therefore, the factory is not only free from suspicion of being a treacherous merchant, but also effectively resists enemy goods. It is reported that the Municipal Federation of Commerce deeply admires the factory's enthusiasm for resistance and will officially certify it as a completely national goods manufacturer.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to Correct Delays in Handling Cases by the Court <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sufficient Preparation Required Before Court Sessions, Skillful Questioning Especially Important During Hearings. Yesterday, the Shanghai Local Court received an order, No. 1471, from the Jiangsu Higher Court, which was forwarded from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The order stated that while judges should focus and question skillfully during court hearings, sufficient preparation before the hearings is even more crucial to avoid aimless questioning. Recent investigations have found that many judges do not thoroughly review case files or determine a direction for investigation beforehand. As a result, initial court sessions often follow routine procedures without grasping the key points, requiring at least one additional session per case. This not only hinders the proper administration of justice but also wastes time. The cumulative effect over a year is significant and causes delays, potentially leading to collusion and alteration of evidence, thereby obscuring the truth of the case. The presiding officers of the respective courts bear supervisory responsibility. Hereafter, they must strictly correct the handling of cases by the investigators, prosecutors, and judges to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness, while also saving personnel and expenses. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the court and forwarded to its subordinates for unified attention and compliance.</p>

<p>Machine Manufacturers' Association Also Re-Inspects Da Zhonghua, Re-Inspects Yisheng Factory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has sent letters again to eight rubber factories, including Yiyuan, and the China Ping Pong Company, warning them to relocate, which has aroused deep concern from all sectors of society. The Machinery-Made National Goods Factories United Association believes that there are errors in the Municipal Council's warning letter and has raised questions. Therefore, the Municipal Council has specifically scheduled a second inspection this morning of Yisheng Factory No. 1 at No. 83, Pinlang Road, and Yisheng Factory No. 2 at No. 31, Pinlang Road.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Inspecting Da Zhonghua <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factories United Association has noted that its member factories, including Da Zhonghua, Zhengda, Yisheng No. 1, Yisheng No. 2, and the China Ping Pong Company, have repeatedly been warned by the Municipal Council. With the exception of Zhengda and the China Ping Pong Company, which no longer have issues, Yisheng Factory is scheduled for re-inspection by the Municipal Council this morning. The Association has specifically dispatched Secretary-General Cheng Shouzhong to inspect Da Zhonghua again this morning in order to gather materials for further negotiations with the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Statement from the Machine Manufacturers' Association <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of the Machine Manufacturers' Association told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency that the British and French Municipal Councils have repeatedly warned a total of eleven national goods factories, including Yiyuan, Tianxing, Dade, Rongda, Zhengda, Shanghai Industrial, Da Zhonghua, Meiya No. 9, Yisheng No. 1, Yisheng No. 2, and the China Ping Pong Company. Five of these factories are members of this Association. Based on the reports from its members and detailed investigations, the Association has found many errors on the part of the Municipal Council. This proves that the Council's actions are based on speculation and lack concrete evidence. For the sake of prudence, the Association plans to send specialized personnel familiar with factory conditions to inspect the factories again. As for factories that are not members of the Association, the Association has not visited them because they have not requested it. However, if any factory wishes to request assistance from the Association, the Association will treat them equally and provide guidance without obligation.</p>
<p>Arabic Numerals for Number Codes</p>
<h3 id="e97">Telegraph Bureau to Implement Order Tomorrow <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>To facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications previously decided to use Arabic numerals to replace house numbers and other numerical figures in telegrams. For example, the number 1312 or 1312 yuan can be written as (1312) and calculated as one telegraphic word, but it must be enclosed in parentheses to avoid confusion. However, if there are more than four digits, starting from five digits, it will be calculated as two words, and so on. The Ministry of Communications has formally ordered the local Ministry of Communications Telegraph Bureau to comply with this measure, which will be implemented starting August 1st. However, this measure only applies to domestic telegrams and does not apply to Nanyang (Southeast Asia) and European and American countries.</p>

However, the Korean delegation was noticed by certain authorities en route, resulting in the secret arrest of two members. Their whereabouts remain unknown. The names of the delegates arriving in Shanghai are kept strictly confidential by all parties, so details are lacking.

<p>Recently, the Misao Shipping Company announced the cancellation of year-end bonuses and the change to monthly salary increases, which aroused opposition from the marine engineers. The treatment of the officers and engineers is different (captains, chief mates, and second mates are officers, while chief engineers, first assistant engineers, second assistant engineers, and third assistant engineers are engineers). The engineers rose up in opposition. Yesterday, the company sent Li Yuncheng to the marine engineers' association to negotiate with Feng Yuming, Mao Jinsheng, Huang Yucai, and others. The company representative decided on the following salary increase plan: For the new Misao ships, the chief engineer will receive an additional 25 yuan, the first assistant engineer 15 yuan, the second assistant engineer 10 yuan, and the third assistant engineer 5 yuan. For the Misao ships, the chief engineer will receive an additional 10 yuan, the first assistant engineer 10 yuan, and the second assistant engineer 10 yuan. For the Misao Jing ships, the chief engineer will receive an additional 10 yuan, the first assistant engineer 10 yuan, and the second assistant engineer 10 yuan. However, the marine engineers' association insisted that the increases must be implemented according to the following plan: For the new Misao ships, the captain should receive an additional 75 yuan per month, the chief engineer 50 yuan, the chief mate and first assistant engineer 25 yuan each, the second mate and second assistant engineer 15 yuan each, and the third mate and third assistant engineer 10 yuan each. For the Misao ships, the captain should receive an additional 50 yuan, the chief engineer 20 yuan, and the chief mate and first assistant engineer 15 yuan each, and the second mate and second assistant engineer 10 yuan each. For the Misao Jing ships, the captain should receive an additional 50 yuan, the chief engineer 20 yuan, the chief mate 25 yuan, the first assistant engineer 20 yuan, and the second mate and second assistant engineer 15 yuan each. The company representative agreed to consult with superiors and respond later.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Report on the Tragic Situation of Banditry in Henan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Jisheng Society Appeals for Relief Funds. The China Jisheng Society recently received a telegram from Guo Jundai, the Administrative Inspector of the Ninth District of Henan, stating that the Southern Henan Special Zone, including the old counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Xixian, Shangcheng, Gushi, Luoshan, and Xinyang, and the new counties of Jingfu and Lihuang, were once known for their prosperity. However, since the spread of communist doctrines from Wuhan, which soon reached Huangma in Hubei, the people of Southern Henan feared its harm to society. In the summer of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), they gathered tens of thousands of people to advance on Macheng. Although they were unable to completely eradicate the bandits due to limited strength, this demonstration prevented the bandits from stepping into Southern Henan for two years. Later, the country faced many misfortunes, and internal wars occurred frequently. Taking advantage of the opportunity, starting from May of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), a group of only dozens of people with more than thirty guns launched an uprising. They exploited the wavering youths, bribed poor farmers with small benefits, and used vagrants as vanguards to wreak havoc everywhere. As a result, Shangcheng fell, followed by Gushi, and Guangshan and Luoshan were subsequently lost, with Yichuan also in imminent danger. Only Xixian remained unaffected. However, the bandits responded like an echo, and the disaster was equally severe. Last year, the army achieved victory and established the two counties of Jingfu and Lihuang in succession, and the area was gradually pacified. However, the remnants unfortunately remained hidden in the border areas and showed signs of resurgence. In addition to harming the people through robbery, murder, and looting, there were also so-called "Skinning Pavilion," "Mass Graves," and "Exposed Bone Piles," whose cruelty was so severe that even heaven, earth, and ghosts would weep. Furthermore, countless others fled or died of starvation or disease. Statistics show that the original population of over three million has been reduced to only five or six tenths, and many of those remaining are barely alive. The organizations of rural villages and markets have been completely destroyed and reduced to ruins. In addition, famine and pestilence are converging, creating a scene of utter desolation. There is not a single piece of clean land, and no household has a single grain of overnight food. Some abandon their parents because they cannot provide even thin gruel, and some abandon their wives and children because they cannot even get their fill of vegetable roots. Alas, the survivors cannot live through the day. It is earnestly hoped that you will show great compassion and provide generous relief. The report requesting relief has arrived. Previously, the Society sent relief workers to Lihuang, Jingfu, and other counties to investigate the situation, which was indescribable. The reported situation was even less severe than what was witnessed firsthand. Where can we find large amounts of relief funds to help these millions of survivors on the verge of starvation?</p>

<p>Lü Gongwang, also known as Dai Zhi, formerly the Acting Military Governor of Zhejiang and Garrison Commander of Jiahu, has recently been engaged in business in Shanghai. On February 23rd of this year, he pledged 100 bales of Sanyang brand cotton yarn from the Yongyuheji Textile Company, which he managed, to the Sanma Road Silk Industry Bank for a loan of 9,000 taels of silver. When the loan matured and he failed to redeem the pledge, the creditor was unable to retrieve the goods from the warehouse. The guarantor, Dai Zibin, director of the Kailuan Coal Mine Business Department, refused to handle the matter. Therefore, Luo Qinghua, manager of the Silk Industry Bank, hired Dong Yu as a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Lü and Dai of joint fraud. The details of the interrogation have been reported previously. On the morning before yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian summoned both parties for a continued hearing in Criminal Court No. 2. According to the defendant Lü Dai Zhi, he is currently a staff officer in the 55th Division of the Army (Commander Wu Sui) and is an active-duty soldier. According to Article 10 of the Army Trial Law, soldiers should be tried by military law, and ordinary courts cannot accept the case. He requested that the case be transferred to a military court for trial. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the defendant Lü Dai Zhi is indeed a formal businessman and did not raise the issue of military status during the previous hearing. He is only raising it today, which clearly shows that he has indeed committed a crime and is trying to evade responsibility. He is raising the issue of military status to deceive the court and should be noted. Mr. Pan from the Bank of China was summoned to court. Because the defendant raised the issue of military jurisdiction, he was not questioned. The judge adjourned the hearing to August 4th to verify the information before proceeding.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Settlement of the Lawsuit Involving the Qing Dyeing Guild in the Beijing Style <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Qing Dyeing Guild in the Beijing Style, located on Fuyou Road in the city, had over a thousand dyeing workers during its heyday. The guild was also quite prosperous and owned real estate on Carter Road. Later, with the influx of foreign goods, the Beijing-style Qing dyeing industry declined sharply. All dyeing workers gradually lost their jobs. The strong changed professions, while the old and weak simply sat and waited for death. There were two to three hundred people. Moreover, the guild was heavily in debt. Later, because it was unable to maintain the livelihood of these unemployed workers, directors Li Chuanyao and Feng Liangfu convened a meeting of all directors and decided to sell the guild's assets to repay debts and distribute the remaining funds to the unemployed workers for alternative livelihoods. At that time, it was also resolved to sell the Immortal Weng Temple in the Fuyou Road Guild. However, the tenants renting the houses in the guild were ordered to move out. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jiacai and Li Shengxian, who were also in the dyeing industry, gathered their colleagues and advocated for the preservation of the guild's assets. They sued Li Chuanyao and others for selling public property in the judicial office. The lawsuit has been ongoing since February of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), totaling five years, and has now reached a conclusion. The verdict was in favor of Li Chuanyao and others. Therefore, the tenant representatives Wang Jingru and Zhang Jiacai were repeatedly urged to move out of the guild's premises immediately, or they would be demolished. However, the tenant representatives Wang Jingru and Zhang Jiacai were in a dilemma because they were entrusted by the preservation faction. They submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that the Qing Dyeing Guild representative Li Chuanyao be ordered to postpone the demolition. The Municipal Public Security Bureau found that in this case, Li Chuanyao and others had already won the final verdict and should be handled in accordance with Articles 10 and 23 of the Tenant Lease Rules. Yesterday, the local Section One Branch of the Second District was specially ordered to summon representatives from both sides to provide proper guidance. Chief Shen summoned guild representative Li Chuanyao and Feng Liangfu, tenant representatives Wang Jingru and Zhang Jiacai, and preservationists Li Shengxian and Zhang Jiacai to the office at 3:00 PM yesterday. Under benevolent persuasion, tenant representatives Wang Jingru and others were willing to vacate the premises within twenty days and provided a written guarantee. Li Chuanyao and others were instructed not to demolish the houses within the time limit, and Zhang Jiacai and others were not allowed to obstruct them again. The years-long lawsuit was thus concluded.</p>

<p>In addition to existing animals, special purchases of elephants, apes, lions, and tigers will be made from Siam. The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in the South City, constructed for one year, is now complete and ready to open on August 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Construction Process <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The zoo is located across from the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road, the original site of the Qinpu. Construction began in August of last year and was divided into three phases. The first phase was completed in December of last year, and the second phase was completed in February of this year. The Municipal Engineering Bureau handed over each phase to the Municipal Government, which dispatched personnel along with the Municipal Education Bureau to accept them. The Municipal Education Bureau then dispatched personnel to take custody of them. Before the opening, Shen Xiangrui, former director of the First Public School Garden, was responsible for managing the animals.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Opening Tomorrow <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to the zoo's original plan, it was originally intended to open this spring. Initially, the zoo's construction funds were allocated from the Music Hall's construction funds, with 20,000 yuan allocated from the Music Hall construction fees and 7,000 yuan for purchasing animals, and 13,000 yuan for the cost of construction. Later, due to the construction of the peacock pavilion and miscellaneous poultry houses, the budget was exceeded and the Municipal Government was asked for further funds. The project was completed in May. It could have opened in June, but the Examination Committee borrowed the park for office space, so the opening was delayed until August 1st. The opening rules have been announced by the Municipal Education Bureau. Tickets are six copper coins per person, half price for children, and annual passes are one silver yuan each, all sold at the zoo's ticket office.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Purchasing Animals <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The zoo currently has more than fifty kinds of animals, the most expensive being a pair of lions at 2,150 yuan, a tiger at 950 yuan, and a leopard at 210 yuan, all purchased from Nanyang last year. The total amount of consumption by all animals is about 10 yuan per day, especially lions, tigers, and leopards, which consume the most, eating about 7 yuan of beef per day. Currently, in addition to purchasing unique animals at any time, it is planned to purchase elephants, apes, and other animals from Siam. An elephant is currently being negotiated, costing about 2,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Northeast Relief Association Concludes Operations, Issues Special Declaration Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Will Continue to Provide Assistance if Entrusted with Tasks, Wholeheartedly Responsible. The Republic of China Northeast Refugee Relief Association, organized by Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Zhu Ziqiao, and Shi Liangcai, has been dedicated to assisting and providing relief to the Northeast. Due to environmental factors, it is scheduled to conclude all operations today. Yesterday, it issued a special declaration to report to all sectors that it will continue to provide assistance wholeheartedly if entrusted with tasks and will be responsible. The original text stated: Since its establishment, the Association has received widespread public support, which has been vital to maintaining the anti-Japanese work of the Northeast Volunteer Army. Internationally, it is recognized that the nation will not succumb to violence, and the ironclad case of refusing to recognize the puppet state awaits the nation's efforts. This is due to the sacrifice of patriotic athletes and unknown heroes, as well as the support and efforts of the public. Unfortunately, the past authorities in North China were timid and suspicious. They became fearful of the development of the righteous army and plotted to take over command. After seizing military power, they failed to take responsibility and delayed the opportunity. Taking advantage of the situation, Japan occupied Jehol and invaded Peiping and Tianjin, endangering North China and deepening the national crisis. The Association has decided to conclude operations on the 31st due to current environmental factors. A detailed report will be issued at that time. Qinglan, Tingkai, Zongyao, and others will continue to abandon their own goals and continue their work of national salvation through resistance to Japan without interruption. The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, responsible for assisting and directing the Northeast Volunteer Army's anti-Japanese efforts, has been deeply rooted in the people for over a year and will continue to work as usual without being interrupted by any difficulties. In the past, loyalists at the end of the Ming Dynasty were unwilling to see their country perish at the hands of foreign tribes and secretly formed organizations to restore their nation. Ultimately, this latent force overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Today, the land forcibly occupied by Japan is internationally recognized as our country's territory. How can we fail to devise an organization to deeply penetrate the area to recover the lost land? Qinglan, Tingkai, Zongyao, and others are determined to devote their efforts to this, but the focus is on practical action, not publicity. If you have any assistance tasks to entrust, Qinglan, Tingkai, Zongyao, and others will continue to provide assistance wholeheartedly and be responsible.</p>
<p>Huang Xinpu, a car driver from Pudong, was hired from the Huifang Automobile Company, located at No. 337, Route Edward VII, East Xinjiao in the French Concession. The car was hired on an hourly basis. The company dispatched Huang Xinpu, a driver from Pudong, to drive a sedan with Concession license No. 12572 and Chinese license No. 780. After the four men got into the car, they drove to the corner of Route Vallon in the French Concession and stopped. One person remained in the car, and after the other three got out of the car, two robbers broke into the Shunchang Tobacco and Paper Shop, owned by Chen Shunyi, a local, at No. 32 along the road, and committed robbery. One robber stood guard outside the door. They robbed more than seventy yuan in banknotes. After the robbery, the robbers got into the car and ordered the driver to drive to the Yuyongchang Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 12 Shanzhong Road, where they robbed more than three hundred yuan in banknotes. Afterwards, they stopped briefly on Route Pichon in the French Concession. One of the robbers remained in the car to guard it. At 12:45 PM, they ordered the driver to drive back to the automobile company. On the way, they passed near the Duoyi Restaurant on Route Edward VII and ordered the car to stop. They then pulled out a gun to intimidate the driver. After the robbers got out of the car, they fled into the small alley next to the east side of the restaurant. When the car stopped on Route Pichon, passersby noticed that it was suspicious and reported the car's license number to the Songshan Road Patrol Room. At this time, the two tobacco and paper shop owners who were robbed reported the robbery to the patrol room. The Western patrol chief immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. At 1:30 PM, they went to the Huifang Automobile Company and brought back the car used in the robbery and the suspect driver Huang Xinpu to the patrol room for custody and interrogation. This morning, they were sent to the Second Special District Court for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Ministry of Communications Issues Order on Principles for Entrusting Long-Distance Telephone Services to Three Telecommunications Bureaus <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>| To avoid past competition between national and provincial operations | In light of the increasing development of provincial long-distance telephone services in recent years, the Ministry of Communications, considering that, according to telecommunications regulations, the ministry should be in charge of operations, believes that independent setups would not only violate regulations and disrupt the system but also make unified management impossible, leading to operational competition. Therefore, the ministry has drafted fourteen principles for entrusting provincial governments to manage long-distance telephone services on behalf of the ministry in order to achieve cooperation between the ministry and provinces and jointly promote the rapid development of telecommunications, thereby avoiding past competition between national and provincial operations. These principles have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the ministry issued an order to its subordinate Telephone Bureau, Telegraph Bureau, and Telecommunications Bureau yesterday to implement them.</p>
<p>The full text of the principles is also promulgated and recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Communications may, without prejudice to the scope of its own telegraph and telephone services, entrust provincial governments to manage long-distance telephone services (hereinafter referred to as "entrusted long-distance telephone services") on behalf of the ministry, based on actual needs. The scope of such long-distance telephone services shall be limited to the boundaries of the province. (2) Before laying out entrusted long-distance telephone services, a project proposal shall be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval. The project proposal shall clearly state the following items and include detailed diagrams: (A) Total length of the entire line, (B) Planned locations for telephone calls along the line, (C) Distance between each telephone location, (D) Line construction plan, (E) Equipment manufacturing plan, (F) Telephone connection method, (G) Estimated construction period for line laying and equipment installation, (H) Project budget, (I) Overview of operations. (3) For long-distance telephone services that have already been established by provinces, the provincial governments shall complete the procedures in accordance with Article 2 and submit them to the Ministry of Communications for approval. If the Ministry of Communications deems any aspect to be non-compliant, it may consult and modify the proposal. (4) The construction of entrusted long-distance telephone services shall be carried out in accordance with the plans and regulations approved by the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications may also send personnel to supervise all aspects of the work at any time. (5) The tariffs and all operational methods for entrusted long-distance telephone services shall be approved by the Ministry of Communications. (6) A certain percentage of the total operating revenue of entrusted long-distance telephone services shall be turned over to the Ministry of Communications. The specific amount shall be determined by the ministry and the province through separate consultations based on the operating revenue situation. (7) The operating status of entrusted long-distance telephone services shall be reported to the Ministry of Communications for review in detail on a regular basis. (8) The Ministry of Communications may borrow entrusted long-distance telephone lines for transmitting telegrams, but only to the extent that it does not affect the original telephone utility. (9) Inter-provincial telephone calls shall not be entrusted to provincial governments to manage on behalf of the ministry. If provinces have already interconnected for telephone calls, the Ministry of Communications may acquire them for management at a price or temporarily rent their utility poles. (10) The Ministry of Communications, if deemed necessary, may take over the entrusted long-distance telephone services for management. All lines, machinery, houses, equipment, and other items shall be estimated at depreciated current prices. (11) The lines of entrusted long-distance telephone services shall avoid being installed parallel to the lines of the ministry's long-distance telephone services. If this situation already exists, another solution shall be devised. (12) In places where the Ministry of Communications has telegraph bureaus or radio stations, entrusted long-distance telephone services shall not engage in disguised telegram services such as notification calls or telephone transmission of telegrams. (13) When provincial governments need to establish military long-distance telephone services, they must first consult the Ministry of Military Affairs, which shall then forward the consultation to the Ministry of Communications for record. Upon the completion of military affairs, the facilities shall be transferred to the management of the Ministry of Communications. (14) These principles shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Reorganization of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the director of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall, recognizing the importance of martial arts in physical education and tactics, decided to expand the organization of the hall and make it popular throughout the city. Furthermore, due to the resignations, departures from Shanghai, and deaths of many board members since the January 28th Incident, there are many vacancies. In order to fill these vacancies and ensure the health of the board of directors, it was decided to reorganize the board. Therefore, at 7 p.m. the night before last, a meeting was held at the French Concession YMCA, specially entrusting Li Dachao, the section chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, to discuss the reorganization of the hall's affairs in conjunction with hall directors Ye Liang, Li Zunguang, Chen Xuliang, Gu Wensheng, and Ling Weichuan. Li Dachao presided over the meeting, and Qian Weiju recorded the minutes. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Regarding the number of directors to be appointed, it was resolved to tentatively set the number at 45. (2) Regarding the selection of directors, it was resolved that they must possess the following four qualifications: (1) prominent figures in society, (2) martial arts experts, (3) martial arts enthusiasts, and (4) those with close ties to the hall. The allocation of these positions shall be as follows: 20 persons shall be introduced by the winding-up committee of the standing committee of the hall and presented to the mayor for approval and appointment, and the remaining 25 persons shall be directly appointed by the mayor. (3) Regarding the maintenance of the hall's affairs during the transitional period, it was resolved that the daily maintenance of the hall's affairs before the new board of directors is formed shall be handled by the winding-up committee in conjunction with Section Chief Li. (4) Regarding the handover, it was resolved that it shall be handled jointly with Section Chief Li after the new board of directors is formed.</p>

<p>Please factories give support. The China Relief Association has been sparing no effort in engaging in domestic relief work for many years. Recently, in view of the rising cost of living and the large number of unemployed people who have come to request relief, often several times a day, it is planned to organize common people's domestic goods sales teams to reduce the number of beggars in society and prevent the breeding of thieves. The goods sold will be limited to daily necessities, and the profits earned each day will be distributed equally among the members of each sales team to ensure a livelihood. It has now been decided to start with ten teams, each with five people, with a head of the team to guide the team. Anyone with a clean background, regardless of gender, who is unable to make a living and can provide a guarantor, can register at the Relief Section of the association on Longmen Road, Racecourse Road, for assignment. It would be greatly appreciated if domestic goods factories could entrust the association to help promote sales or show compassion for the hungry and drowning and generously donate to the cause.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Second Branch of the High Court to Request Exemption of Flower and Tree Nursery Land <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday wrote to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to request the exemption of the land of Xu Wenyuan, a flower and tree nursery operator. The original letter stated: "We hereby notify you that on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Flower and Tree Nursery Association stating that the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court is constructing a new prison in the Pusong District and intends to requisition the land of member Xu Wenyuan. We have found that Xu Wenyuan is located in Block 7 of the 30th Bao, an area with high and airy terrain, suitable soil, and access to waterways. He has devoted years of effort to afforestation and soil cultivation, collecting tens of thousands of seedlings of rare and exotic trees, planting them by hand, and establishing their roots. The branches and stems are still weak and difficult to transplant. If they are abandoned, they will have no chance of survival. Even with compensation, it would be impossible to compensate for even a fraction of the loss. Moreover, according to the shape of the land being requisitioned for the new prison, viewing the entire area, our member's nursery is located at the tip of a corner and not in the center, making avoidance highly possible. Furthermore, the land being requisitioned is already more than 160 mu. Reducing the area by more than 10 mu would not seem to hinder the overall plan for the construction of the new prison. The layout of the new prison, the number of buildings, etc., are arrangements for the future. The construction can be carried out according to the size of the land. If there is not enough land, other open spaces can still be requisitioned. Even if the security perimeter is affected, a river can be opened to compensate. Why is it necessary to destroy a nursery that has been cultivated for many years? Tree seedlings are not comparable to potted flowers, which can be sold at any time. At least ten years are needed for a tree to mature and become profitable. Now, the seedlings have been cultivated for several years, and once they are forced to relocate, they will become waste. Moreover, the same land has differences in height and suitability of soil, and the timing is even more important. Given these difficulties, relocation is truly difficult and must be requested to be exempted from requisition in order to maintain a livelihood. Please forward our request to the Second Branch for approval." We have found that nurseries are different from farmland. Once relocated, the weak branches and stems of the seedlings are very difficult to transplant and will inevitably be abandoned. If their livelihoods are destroyed in this way, how can they survive? Moreover, according to the map, Xu Wenyuan's nursery being requisitioned is located at the very tip of a corner, and the land area is only one-tenth of the total area being requisitioned, making avoidance possible. It does not seem to hinder the overall prison plan. Accordingly, we are writing to your branch to explain the situation and earnestly request that you consider the difficulty of relocating the nursery and exempt Xu Wenyuan's nursery from requisition. If the area does not meet the original plan, please requisition other open spaces to make up the difference, so that both prison administration and people's livelihood can be taken into account. We believe this is in the spirit of public interest.</p>

<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the recent European mail passing through Vladivostok and Japan is delayed in arriving in Shanghai. The most recent batch of mail received by local businesses and individuals was 450 bags brought by the Shanghai Maru on the 17th of this month. A reporter inquired with the post office yesterday and was told that 208 bags were scheduled to be shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai on the Tianjin Maru on the 25th of this month, but they have not yet arrived. Apart from delays in through transport, there is no other known special reason. There are currently 900 bags expected to be shipped by the Nagasaki Maru yesterday, and they are scheduled to begin distribution to recipients at 6 p.m. last night. Regarding airmail, the local postal authorities stated that letters and packages can be delivered using a combination of airplanes and other means of transportation, at the discretion of the sender.

<h3 id="e122">Criminal Investigations Must Not Extend Detention Periods <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Follow rules and bring to speedy conclusion. The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate yesterday received Instruction No. 2263 from the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate, which forwarded it from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The instruction stated that the investigation period and rules for criminal trials are strictly regulated, and the period of detention of the accused is clearly stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. When a procurator receives a case, they should bring it to a speedy conclusion and must not arbitrarily delay it simply because the time limit has not expired. However, in recent times, procurators have often been negligent and perfunctory in handling cases, failing to conduct thorough investigations. When the investigation period expires, they often try to cover up their mistakes. When the accused's detention period expires, they use the legal provisions for extending detention and apply for an extension. Eventually, when no further extensions are possible, they hastily file a lawsuit in an attempt to shirk responsibility. This is completely unacceptable. Therefore, you are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates that when handling cases in the future, they must conduct speedy investigations and bring them to a conclusion in accordance with the law. If the above-mentioned situation is found again, strict punishment will be imposed and no leniency will be shown. This order is hereby issued. Upon receiving this order, you are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to comply.</p>

After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the discussion focused on how to request improvements to the new tax regulations, which are mostly detrimental to the industry, in order to seek relief. After public deliberation, the following three measures were resolved: (1) The provisions of the new tax that are detrimental to the industry should be amended. (2) Special stamps should still be retained. (3) The quantity of containers should be converted to the market scale according to the original jin. If these objectives cannot be achieved, all workshops will stop operations and brewing. The trade association will send a letter to the Shanghai Soy Sauce and Pickles Trade Association, notifying its members to stop taking and transporting consignment goods. At the same time, a detailed explanation will be sent to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industry Federation to argue the case. A circular will also be sent to the Wine-Making Workers' Union, asking them to inform the original workers of the factories to stop working and find other livelihoods. A letter will also be presented to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking them to uphold justice and provide assistance. We vow not to achieve our goals and are willing to sacrifice our business in order to achieve final victory. The entire resolution was passed. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.</p>

<p>Tan Baoshou, the district chief of the Sixth District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in Caobao, Shanghai West, has spared no effort in rectifying internal and external duties since taking office. Previously, due to the insufficient number of police officers, four police stations were added at Zhongshan Road Bridge, Yuyuan Road, Zhuanbang, and Bailinan Road, with a platoon of police officers stationed at each station. As a result, the defense was slightly more comprehensive. Currently, in view of the fact that within the jurisdiction, various roads are being built across each other, the remote and desolate wilderness stretches for tens of li. Whenever an accident occurs, it is felt that the whip cannot reach. Therefore, a special request was made to the Director of the Public Security Bureau and forwarded to Mayor Wu for approval to establish five more guard posts in selected locations within the jurisdiction of the district, with four police officers stationed at each post. In the event of an accident, a report can be made at any time. The locations are recorded below: (1) Intersection of Jisi Feier Road and Difeng Road, (2) Intersection of Daxi Road and Difeng Road, (3) Haige Road, (4) Near the Fanhuangdu Railway Station on Bailinan Road, (5) Near the Minsheng Factory on Huobilan Road. The search for suitable housing is currently underway, and active preparations are being made. It is expected that the establishment will be implemented soon. It is reported that four guard posts will also need to be established within the jurisdiction of the First Branch of the Sixth District: (1) Lincoln Road, (2) Airport, (3) Piyasi Road, (4) Maclane Road. The jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Sixth District is: (1) Hongqiao Road, (2) Haige Road, (3) Daxi Road, (4) Columbia Road.

<p>A total of eight robbers were apprehended at two locations, along with a handgun. They are temporarily held at the police station pending transfer to the court for interrogation. The residence of Xing Suixuan, a prominent Nanxun industrialist, located at No. 6, Lane 622, Beijing Road, was suddenly targeted by over ten bandits for robbery.

The gang fled in panic upon hearing the news, abandoning over five thousand yuan in cash and two handguns at the scene and escaping over rooftops. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Following the incident, the police investigation concluded that although the case appeared to be a common robbery, its underlying details were unusually ambiguous and complex. Nevertheless, vigorous investigation continued until 6:00 AM yesterday when Land Lien-kuei, Chief Inspector of the General Police Station, Detectives Feng Zhiming and Shao Jingfan, etc., discovered the robbers hiding in the Dingping Lane of the Avenue Laregna in the French Concession.

<p>Fresh blood flowed from the lower body; sent to the District Court for autopsy. Zhengfeng Clothing Store, located at No. 274, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, was established with funds raised by Nanxun merchants. Its manager, Han Guisheng, 46, is from Nanxun. The store had just begun operations in early March of this year. Han had a friend from the same hometown, Gu Suizhi, 31 years old. Considering that Gu had been unemployed for a long time, Han introduced him to the clothing store as an employee. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Gu suddenly suffered from a severe ailment, exhibiting alarming symptoms. He became speechless, unresponsive, and lost consciousness. Upon seeing this, Han quickly hired a vehicle to rush Gu to the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, for emergency treatment. However, Gu died en route to the hospital. The hospital, following procedure, did not register the death and sent the body to the mortuary. However, the hospital doctor discovered that fresh blood was flowing incessantly from Gu's blue cloth trousers around the lower body. Suspecting something amiss, the hospital questioned Han, who claimed that the deceased had suffered from ringworm and other skin conditions in the scrotum area before. He had sought treatment at the Lianyi Charity Association in Hanqiao some days prior, where a doctor diagnosed it as a result of syphilis, leading Gu to discontinue treatment. Gu then became delusional, believing that the ailment was caused by evil spirits and privately sought treatment from a female shaman without success. The previous evening, Gu had washed the area with alum water, and the bleeding may have been caused by abrasion. Upon learning this information, the hospital doctor, suspecting other circumstances, notified the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. District Chief Lai dispatched personnel to investigate and instructed Lu Abaobao, the head of the Eleventh Baojia (neighborhood watch unit), to petition the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy. Around 4:00 PM yesterday, a prosecutor, accompanied by forensic officials, arrived at the hospital morgue to conduct a detailed examination. However, a death certificate was not completed at the time; the Baojia chief was only instructed to arrange for the burial of the body.</p>

<p>Liu Qiming, 32 years old, from Nantong, works at the Zhentai Watch Shop on Xizang Road in the Public Concession. Due to his impoverished family background and meager income, he had not yet married. However, as he grew older, he longed to start a family. He saved diligently and accumulated some savings. At the beginning of last month, through the matchmakers Ni Zhaoxiang and Li Sanbao, he was betrothed to a woman named Zhang from Haimen. They agreed on a bride price of 120 yuan and some jewelry and clothing. Liu chose the 23rd of this month as the wedding day. However, the bride, Zhang, was already accustomed to a life of luxury and loved fashion. The day before the wedding, she found out that the groom was poor, partially blind in one eye, and quite old. She strongly objected and planned to escape. Fortunately, the matchmakers and her relatives persuaded her, and the wedding proceeded. However, just two days later, on the afternoon of the 25th, the bride Zhang falsely claimed that she was going to visit a relative, Qian Zibin, and would return soon.

Both men were intoxicated and engaged in a physical altercation, exchanging blows and kicks. Constables from Nos. 156 and 223 arrived after being alerted and arrested both Liang and Jiang, taking them to the bridge on O'Ka Road. Jiang Yuqing suddenly collapsed and was hired a rickshaw to be taken to the O'Ka Road police station. The police chief, believing it was a drunken brawl, released Liang Yutao but had Jiang sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Jiang died en route. The police immediately dispatched detective Liu Shuxun to re-arrest Liang Yutao and escort him to the First Special District Court. Liang denied injuring Jiang Yuqing's waist with his fists. The court sent a prosecutor to examine the deceased Jiang Yuqing's injuries, but the true cause of death remained unclear. Later, a forensic examination revealed that two ribs had been fractured, causing fatal damage to the spleen. Yesterday, a judge presided over the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station presented the previous circumstances, stating that a Japanese constable was present to testify about the arrest. Constable No. 223 stated that he saw a crowd gathered at the scene and witnessed two Chinese men fighting, so he arrested them both. At the O'Ka Road bridge, one Chinese man (the deceased) suddenly fell to the ground, so he hired a vehicle to take him to the police station. He was unaware of any other details. The defendant firmly denied the charges. After the forensic report was read aloud in court, and after arguments from the police attorney and the defendant's attorney, Liang Yutao was sentenced to four years in prison as a warning. The number of days of pre-trial detention was to be deducted from the prison sentence at a rate of two days credited for each day served.</p>

<h3 id="e149">The New Red Peril Wings <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After reading Xianxian's article "Red Pills," I also have a few words to say. In fact, this thing is spreading too widely. Not only in Shanghai, but almost the whole country has a trend of being engulfed by the red behemoth, which can be called "the new red peril!" Its speed of spread and the intensity of the disaster have surpassed the Communist Party. The Communists only ravaged the land of several provinces, and the damage was to the lives and property of a portion of the people; the new red peril is like mercury seeping into the ground, penetrating everywhere, not limited to one corner, and sufficient to shackle the entire nation. Moreover, the Communists can still be suppressed by military force, but once the new red peril has spread, it is not easy to find a fundamental way to ban it; the inability to ban opium is a precedent!</p>
<p>In fact, the disaster of opium cannot be compared with the new red peril. To ban opium is not an impossible task. As everyone knows, opium is the juice of the poppy, and the poppy must be planted, and it must take a considerable amount of time to bear fruit, which cannot be done secretly by individuals. But red pills can be manufactured in a small room to supply a large number of consumers. There were not many places where poppies were planted in the past. Now even Jiangsu has planted them. If the planters are strictly banned and the import of foreign opium is strictly prohibited at the same time, it is not impossible to ban it. Only red pills can be secretly manufactured anytime and anywhere, and can be manufactured in large quantities; even if they are seized, another secret manufacturing organization can be set up; unlike opium, which is not produced in most local areas and must be transported from other places, the rapid spread of red pills is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Smoking opium is aristocratic. At present, if your pocket is not two-eighths full, don't even think about lying on a couch, as Xianxian said. I don't think so. Smoking red pills also requires two-eighths full. In fact, there are more people smoking red pills than smoking opium, but the cost of red pills often exceeds that of opium. Or maybe it should be said that the equipment for smoking opium must be exquisite, and at the very least, you must have a good opium pipe. When smoking, you must carefully load the bowl, and after one bowl is finished, you must put down the pipe and carefully load the second bowl. It is not as simple and quick as smoking red pills, which does not require loading bowl by bowl, and can consume dozens of pills in one breath. The reason why laborers (such as rickshaw pullers) abandon opium and take pills is mostly for convenience and speed. There is also another level: if the smoker cooks the opium himself, he must buy raw opium for a lot of money and slowly cook it into smoke. Red pills can be bought at any time for eight cents, and can be smoked as soon as they are purchased. Therefore, most of those who smoke opium are leisure classes and intellectuals, so it naturally looks like it has become aristocratic. However, it cannot be judged by the amount of consumption. There are also people who smoke red pills for a few yuan a day. Now many places ban pills but not opium, which further illustrates that the harm of the new red peril is greater than that of opium.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Sweat Lanxi <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Sweat is a special product of summer. It is also produced by hard work; and also by excessive entertainment.</p>
<p>People in the leisure class and the property class have fewer opportunities to sweat. They, or she, drink ice under the activity of electric fans and between the surrounding air conditioning pipes to feel the heat. They are unlikely to sweat much. If there is any, it is just a few drops on the tip of the nose, which is not only not stinky, but also, it is said, fragrant丨丨and especially young ladies and wives, because they are covered with the best imported talcum powder, which emits a kind of fragrance in secret. If they sweat a little more, then the powder applied to their bodies dissolves with the sweat, and a chemical reaction produces a charming fragrance, which has never been disliked by gentlemen and all noble men. This kind of sweat should be given considerable praise and allowed to exist.</p>
<p>However, turning to another point, there is a kind of stinky sweat that makes you want to vomit for three days, which you dare not accept but often have to accept, and that is the sweat of coolies.</p>
<p>The small workers and rickshaw pullers who are constantly evaporating under the hot sun and wearing coarse cloth clothes have no time to take a bath at all, so they sweat dozens of times a day, and they can only let it get wet and dry, and then dry and wet again, repeating this cycle, day after day, (they either don't know what hygiene is, or they don't have many clothes to change, so each piece of clothing is worn for many days,) which will refine a kind of acidic, extraordinarily bad smell. No wonder the modern young ladies twisting on the road often cover their jade noses with a small handkerchief, and also lock their eyebrows that have been dyed, showing a contemptuous attitude.</p>
<p>Our enjoyment is far less comfortable than the rich, but also less laborious than the coolies. We often sweat, and when we taste it ourselves, we don't feel it's stinky, but think it's fragrant. However, this is a biased and subjective judgment. In fact, we, these so-called "stinky men," where is there any fragrance?</p>
<p>Sweat is a special product of summer. It is fragrant when it comes out on young ladies, but it becomes stinky when it comes out on coolies. However, "sweat" does not know this, but it has to come out on the coolies, alas, God knows.</p>

<p>Seeing the advertisement for the 500,000 yuan lottery prize in the newspaper, my heart couldn't help but flutter a little. Really, this "500,000" is such a large number! Hearing it is enough to make people envious, and if you ever win it, the joy is needless to say. All the so-called difficult problems can be solved easily... Looking at the newspaper, I was thinking blankly.</p>
<p>"How to spend this 500,000 yuan?" This question began to annoy me, for fear that kidnappers would take the opportunity, and robbers would come to the door.</p>
<p>Actively thinking: Let's use this money to start a business! But it seems that there are too many businesses to start at present. This has to be started, and that has to be done. At first glance, the number of 500,000 is quite a lot, but to do this and that, it feels small and not enough!</p>
<p>Passively thinking: Let's use it to help a group of poor relatives and friends, and do some charity work, but I feel that there are too many poor relatives and friends to count. This one has to be helped, and that one has to be saved! The same goes for charitable organizations. This 500,000 yuan is still not enough!</p>
<p>The first is not enough, the second is not enough, the third is still not enough!</p>
<p>"How to spend this 500,000 yuan?" This question began to annoy me.</p>

<p>The thermometer is quickly rising to 100 degrees; people are enveloped in heat, and dogs are also panting with their tongues out. Ordinary poor people are still struggling to earn a living, with sweat dripping like rain. Although they constantly complain about the heat, what good does it do?</p>
<p>Therefore, charitable people are providing tea and dispensing cooling medicine... continuously offering practical benefits to the impoverished, who are truly benefiting greatly.</p>
<p>But isn't that so? Often, a coolie, feeling the heat, seeks some relief from those dispensing medicine, but their servants often bully and scold, giving them the cold shoulder unless you have a personal relationship with them. Otherwise, they will take the entire batch home to give to relatives. This is not just an individual occurrence, but also happens with organized groups providing aid. Indeed, the donors are kept in the dark and unaware.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, just look at disaster relief efforts and donations. Many, many people fill their private pockets! Under the guise of offering assistance and the name of fundraising, they boldly engage in despicable acts, causing donors to lose heart.</p>
<p>I personally saw a coolie being scolded for asking a charitable organization for a bottle of cooling medicine, while they were taking entire boxes of it home. Therefore, I specifically wrote this article, hoping that charitable people will investigate whether their servants are doing such things!</p>

<p>Poor and Lowly Sufferings, Sick Soldiers Fall Behind, Sacrificing Sweetly to Return Home, Sentimental Soldiers.</p>
<p>Sheng Shimin, looking at her, thought she resembled a young lady and asked, "Miss, is this Commander Zhao's house?" Gui Zhi saw that he was wearing a grey coat, although without shoulder marks or a hat, he seemed like a soldier, so she was a little afraid. But after his question, she felt that he wasn't unapproachable, so she replied, "Yes, this is the Zhao family. Who are you looking for?" Sheng Shimin said, "I want to see their old master to tell him something." Commander Zhao originally wanted to come back for a trip, but these past two days, the Commander-in-Chief was coming to inspect the troops, so he couldn't leave. He said that Yang's family matter, he would definitely handle and asked the old master to reply to them first, so that the aunt wouldn't be anxious. Sheng Shimin never dreamed that the two families were next-door neighbors and that he had encountered the person herself. What he said made Gui Zhi feel ashamed and annoyed. She just glared at him. Sheng Shimin was still puzzled and said, "Young lady, please tell the people inside for me. I'm not feeling well and can't shout." Gui Zhi wanted to scold him, but looking at him, she couldn't bring herself to do it. She turned around and went home. Jiang Shi asked, "Who were you talking to at the front door?" Gui Zhi said, "A soldier, talking nonsense." Jiang Shi said, "If he's talking nonsense, just ignore him." Gui Zhi paused before saying, "He came to look for someone. How could I ignore him?" Jiang Shi said, "He's looking for us?" Gui Zhi said, "You see, you really don't understand. If he were looking for us, wouldn't I have invited him in?" Jiang Shi understood that he was looking for the Zhao family. She went to the front door to take a look and then went to the backyard. Gui Zhi was at home, enjoying the snowy day, and had nothing to do. She held a cup of hot tea and leaned against the window, looking outside through the glass. She could faintly hear the voices from the backyard. She heard both Father Zhao and her mother sighing, as if feeling sorry for the sick man. (144)</p>
<h3 id="e154">Lipstick Application Tips <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>If you apply a thick layer of lipstick heavily on your lips when putting on makeup, your lips will tend to become hard.</p>
<p>If your lips have already become hard, don't be discouraged. Simply apply glycerin and lemon to make them soft and enhance their beautiful color, achieving the standard of being both red and vibrant.</p>
<p>If the lipstick you are using is dry and doesn't seem to have any oil in it, apply some moisturizing cream to your lips before applying the lipstick. (Moisturizing cream refers to ordinary vanishing cream, white jade cream, Hazelnut cream, etc.)</p>
<p>If your lips are thick, it's best not to apply lipstick all the way to the edges of your lips. Be sure not to apply it there. If your lips are thin, then apply it completely, even if it goes beyond the lip line.</p>
<p>After applying lipstick, it's best to wipe off some of the color slightly. It's important to know that ordinary mirrors, especially blurry, uneven, or inferior mirrors, often reflect an image that is thinner and darker than reality.</p>
<p>The most scientific and artistic way to apply lipstick is not what most modern girls imagine. It's commonly thought that the most appropriate and convenient method is to apply it horizontally, from the left end of the lips to the right end, and then from the right end to the left end. In fact, this is not the best method. It should be changed to a vertical application, from the upper lip to the lower lip, and then from the lower lip to the upper lip, because the skin in this area also grows from top to bottom and from bottom to top. At the same time, apply it along the lines of the lips. This method takes more time, but you will be immediately satisfied after applying it. If you don't believe it, please try it right away.

<h3 id="e155">Sock-Wearing Tips <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>There is nothing more annoying and frustrating than having a hole in your sock. It is absolutely true that a hole in a sock is very unsightly. The fact is that the amount of time spent on carefully putting on socks should be several times more than the time we usually spend paying attention to them. Socks that don't fit properly, are the wrong size, or are out of style often make us annoyed with our socks, which is really troublesome. For example, sock sizes, styles, and brands vary. Some sock manufacturers often make them half a size larger or smaller than what we normally wear. There is nothing more unsightly and annoying than socks that are wrinkled and not straight on the ankles and knees, or sock tops that are crooked and patterns that are skewed. On the other hand, there is nothing more unsightly and annoying than having holes in the heel and toe areas of new socks. It's also very embarrassing to wear socks that are snagged and unravelling.</p>
<p>If socks have patterns, a straight seam down the back, or a pointed heel design, extra care should be taken to ensure they are straight, neat, and tight. To achieve these three conditions, first choose socks that are the right size and style, and then use garters to hold them up. A single elastic band will never be satisfactory.</p>
<p>As for what color and style of socks to wear, it cannot be generalized. You can wear whatever you like, but the weather and season should be considered. For example, in the summer, you should wear silk or gauze socks in light colors such as white, light yellow, or lotus root pink. If you are sensitive to the cold, then in the winter, you should give up thin silk stockings, which are only good-looking and not warm, and wear thick and warm wool socks. Otherwise, you will suffer from frostbite.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about sock-wearing superstitions. We occasionally accidentally wear a sock inside out, which is considered very unlucky. However, English girls think differently. They consider it very lucky to find their socks inside out. If the inside-out sock is on the left foot, it's especially lucky. There is also another wonderful superstition: when wearing a new pair of socks for the first time, if you sleep with the sock worn on your right foot during the day under your pillow, the dream you have that night will definitely come true. If you have a nightmare, that's terrible. (Pei)</p>

<p>The second meeting of the Preparatory Committee for this year's National Games on the Double Tenth (October 10th) was held at the Ministry of Education from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 29th. Committee members present included Wang Shijie (represented by Lei Zhen), Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Du Tingxiu), Chu Minyi, Xu Wansheng, Ma Xun, Zhang Jiong, Zhang Xinfu, Yuan Dunli, Hao Gengsheng, Wu Yunrui, Zhang Boling (represented by Hao Gengsheng), Liu Ruiheng (represented by Jin Baoshan), Huang Yanming (represented by Ling Yingmei), Shen Siliang, and attendees Lei Zhen, Ma Xiang, Peng Baichuan, Zheng Yanghe, Guo Lianfeng, Wu Zhuozhi, Wu Bangchuanwei, Xu Yanzi, Zhang Zhongfan, and Wu Tunan, totaling over twenty people. The resolutions were detailed in yesterday's report. It is now known that Preparatory Committee members Chu Minyi and others went to the Central Sports Field on the morning of the 30th to inspect the grounds. They found the water supply problem to be the most pressing issue. They immediately convened a standing committee meeting at the Ministry of Education to discuss solutions. It was decided that regarding the water supply, they would first send a letter to the Department of Health to send personnel to the venue to test the well water. If it was drinkable, they would dredge each artesian well for drinking purposes. At the same time, they would send a letter to the Municipal Government to expedite the connection of tap water pipes and tentatively borrow the swimming pool. In addition, the Games office will be temporarily set up in two locations: one at the former site of the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Ministry of Education, specifically for handling paperwork, and the other at the Central Sports Field, for handling venue arrangements. The Games expenses, because only 5,000 yuan have been received, in addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve the remaining 45,000 yuan for prompt allocation, will be divided and telegraphed to Jiang and Wang for an increase in funding.</p>

<p>The second set was more balanced. The English players were quite capable of handling the situation and often attacked the weakest, Brulunion. As a result, after 2-2, they took a 5-3 lead.

However, the English team tied the score again at 6-6. Bolo Talotla felt a sense of urgency and did not dare to be careless.

<p>Shen Yu Defeats the Chinese Association - Mei Lu Team Completely Defeated -</p>
<p>The sixth act of this year's Xianfang Cup Tennis League was held separately yesterday. The Chinese Association, once renowned, was defeated by the newly emerging Shen Yu team, which is truly surprising. And Mei Lu met the railway and suffered a crushing defeat, while Donghua fought Yuyi and narrowly lost by three points, which is also quite strange. It is truly a remarkable achievement since the start of the Xianfang Cup. The battle situation in each game is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e166">Shen Yu Defeats Chinese Association... Ten to Five <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Association lacked star players Sun Linfang and Zhou Champion in yesterday's battle against Shen Yu, which was a misstep. If this continues, the Chinese Association's prospects for this year are very bleak. It is hoped that next week they will embrace a do-or-die attitude, and then the harvest may not be too late. The battle records of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Rongbiao (Shen) defeats Xu Demin (Chinese) 3-6, 6-2, 8-6</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Rongcai (Shen) defeats Li Nan (Chinese) 6-3, 6-1, 3-6</p>
<p>(3) Shao Changling and Zhang Zhongchi (Shen) win by default due to Chinese Association's withdrawal. Shen Yu wins 3-0.</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Rongbiao and Cai (Shen) defeat Chen Jing and Qian Mingqiao (Chinese) 6-3, 7-5, 6-0</p>
<p>(5) Chen Chuanzhang and Xu Demin (Chinese) defeat Jin Xun and Shao Zhenbang (Shen) 7-5, 7-5, 6-1</p>

<p>The railway team received elite troops yesterday and implemented brilliant tactics, defeating the Mei Lu team in one fell swoop, returning with a complete victory, which is truly amazing. The Hu Qichang and Hu Qichao brothers of Mei Lu's second doubles team, who had repeatedly won since they started playing, were also sacrificed under the iron hooves in this battle, which is truly regrettable. However, the Railway's fighting spirit and scoring components are self-evident.</p>
<p>(1) Guo Qida (Railway) defeats Hu Qichang (Mei) 6-2, 6-0, Hu retires</p>
<p>(2) Chen Naixin (Railway) defeats Hu Qichao (Mei) 6-0, 6-0, Hu retires</p>

<p>This battle was full of highlights, and it can be said to be the crown of all matches. He Qiu defeated Guo Yujie, which also seems to be one of the many strange things. The second doubles match was evenly matched, and it was difficult to determine the winner. The closeness of the score was very rare. As a result, after each winning one set, the sun set, and it was difficult to continue the match, so they agreed to replay tomorrow (1st).</p>
<p>(1) He Qiu (Xia) defeats Guo Yujie (You) 6-3, 2-6, 6-3</p>
<p>(2) Keng (You) defeats Chen Bainian (Xia) 6-1, 8-1, 6-1</p>

<p>Donghua's performance has been quite good, but in yesterday's match against Yuyi, they were defeated in all matches except for the first singles and first doubles, which is also a strange thing.</p>
<p>(1) Tu Kaiyuan (Dong) defeats Shen Baigui (Yi) 6-0, 6-2, 6-2</p>
<p>(2) Zhuo Guanpei (Yi) defeats Wu Youliang (Dong) 6-1, 6-2, 6-1</p>

<p>The battle between Datong and Chenguang (Fudan University) was also quite fierce. It can be seen that the success or failure was only a point away. It is said that several Datong players suffered from diarrhea yesterday, which damaged their strength a lot. Otherwise, they might have had a better performance.</p>

<p>Defeats the Entire Philippines College of Economics Team - Forces Out the Entire Min Columbia Team</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanyang High Commercial School's basketball team's Philippine campaign, in its premiere match in Min, defeated the College of Economics, this year's runner-up in the entire Philippines high school basketball tournament, 63 to 39. Following with 49 points to 30 points defeating the elite Columbia team who comprised the Min summer basketball tournament. There's a tendency for the team to be successful at the very start. The processes of the South Trading Business' consecutive crushing of strong enemies in the two battles is written down in brief in what follows.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Painful Strike of College of Economics <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>4PM on the dot, athletes from the two teams each stood in a basket making casting and passing practices. the physiques of the Philippine team were tall and strong, while the South Trading Business team were delicate. The onlookers thought of the Philippine team as last year's basketball runner-up for the Philippines College, with high skill, so worried for South Trading Business School who faced this strong team. The match was divided into 4 quarters, each quarter had 10 points. At 4:30 PM, Referee Yang Shufang called the team captains on both sides to choose a basket, and after the whistle blew, the war curtain was pulled. Wu Zibin from South Trading Business center forward, Chen Jinzhi received with the horizontal technique, and then it was passed to Zhou Cheng, and Zhou single-handedly charged straight in, taking advantage of the situation and casted. The ball rebounded, and before sighs from all around subsided, Wu Zibin captured the ball on the left, passed it far to Zhou Cheng who was hidden beneath the basket, and actually casted it in, therefore the record was opened. Wu Zibin continued to advance and casted another ball in, and the ratio was 4 points to 0 points. The Philippine team thought that South Trading Business' momentum was unusual, and vigorously tried to resist, casting a ball from a distance using its right forward, and followed South Trading Business with 2 points to 4 points. At the start of the contest, the two sides inevitable had excessive misgivings, and acted like something was forgotten from what was standard, particularly the South Trading Business School constantly revealed excessive eagerness, and there was no less than 4 instances when the ball was casted into the basket, but rebounded out. Fortunately, all the generals were able to calmly perform, and entered afterwards, and silently inspected the opponents' weaknesses, and taking advantage of the vulnerability to advance and attack, and actually Chen Jinzhi Zhou Cheng sequentially entered a ball, creating a ratio of 8 points to 2 points. Fighting to South Trading Business School with 10 points to 5 points in the lead, the Philippine team vigorously counter-attacked, and points gradually increased, and South Trading Business School refused to fall behind, and vigorously suppressed, and in the middle of the two sides' struggle, the points gradually drew closer, with the difference between scores often at one or two points of slightness. Until the first quarter was completely over, and the Philippine team was in the lead with a ratio of 15 points to 12 points. The 2nd quarter began, and South Trading Business School substituted Wu Zibin for Han Zhenyuan, and with this main general, the entire team suddenly seemed to be reborn with dragons and tigers, and using the East Strike West method, fought so that the Philippine team lost all their strength and flowers, Chen Jinzhi Han Zhenyuan Zhou Cheng connected attacks, and during this period, South Trading Business School's edge was greatly revealed, and with a ratio of 21 points to 6 points, stole back the position of leadership. Adding the first and second quarters together, South Trading Business School remotely led with 33 points to 19 points. In the 3rd quarter, the two sides easily swapped locations and continued to fight, and the South Trading Business school's athletes occupied the upper hand in the two above-mentioned quarters, and would not let the opportunity go. Cai Wen, the two guards, have already reinforced the defense, and moreover provided the front line with a supply, and the front line generals Chen Zhou had repeatedly obtained a carriage from the rear sending ammunition rations, and invaded enemy territory repeatedly to build work, repeatedly achieving miraculous feats. During this period, the opponent only had the work to resist, and did not have any power to counter-attack, and therefore South Trading Business School greatly won this quarter with 15 points to 5 points. In the last section of the match, Han Zhenyuan and Chen Jinzhi acted its fast-transfer fast dispatch technique, and built feats section by section, while the Philippine team had failure was already just under the eyebrows, and vigorously countered-attacked desperately, and although this section was tied with South Trading Business with 15 points to 15 points, but the points lost in the former three sections was too excessive, there truly was a sigh of having no choice but to more than make up for its loss. Therefore, when the match was over, the total result with 39 points to 63 points, suffered a miserable defeat to the South Trading Business.</p>

<p>Riding high on their previous victory, the Nan Shang team once again took to the field to face the Columbia Academy, an all-star team comprised of elite players from the Min Xia Ling Championship. The Columbia team was further bolstered by the addition of the Young Men's Association stars, Yang Dequan and Guo Pizhen, making their strength even more formidable. Having witnessed Nan Shang's decisive victory against a strong opponent that afternoon, local Chinese residents flocked to the evening game in even greater numbers than before. The game was originally scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM, but due to electrical repairs inside the venue, the lights were delayed until 8:20 PM. As the silver whistle of Yang Shufang sounded, the two teams began their pursuit of the ball, darting east and west. In a moment of intense back-and-forth action, Cai Yanxiong suddenly burst through the crowd, and with a flick of his wrist, the ball sailed into the basket. A thunderous cheer erupted from all around. With Cai having opened the scoring, Zhou Cheng then capitalized on a foul by Yang Dequan to score a free throw, bringing the score to 3-0. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the Philippine team urgently called a timeout to discuss strategy. After the game resumed, Yang Dequan managed to score a point from a free throw, breaking their duck and making it 1-3. From then on, the two sides were evenly matched, with the difference in score rarely exceeding one or two points. The score was tied no fewer than five times, from 9-9 to 13-13, then 16-16, and finally 18-18, until Han Zhenyuan scored a free throw to break the deadlock at 21-20. From that point on, the intensity of the game was breathtaking, and the audience's expressions of excitement as each team scored were almost frenzied. Wan Laolao Min of the Philippine team suddenly scored a basket, making it 22-21. Later, Chen Jinzhi and Han Zhenyuan of Nan Shang employed their lightning-fast shooting skills, scoring several consecutive baskets to take the lead again at 29-22. In the fourth quarter, the Nan Shang forwards unleashed a barrage of shots, shining brilliantly, and the score soared. Although the Philippine team frequently changed players and mounted a desperate last stand, the overall momentum had shifted, making it impossible to salvage the situation. Finally, as the whistle blew, the fierce battle came to an end, and the scoreboard displayed a final score of 47-30, with Nan Shang claiming another victory.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Oldest Female Student in this City <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiuying, 53 years old, is the wife of a worker. She studies at the labor school of the wharf business office 丨 Her goal is to learn arithmetic to keep accounts for her husband 丨</p>
<p>The wharf business office in this city, in order to promote labor education, established three labor schools in April of this year. The first is located at the Pudong wharf on the opposite bank of Yangshupu, the second is located at the Dongchang wharf in Pudong, and the third is located on Changan Road in Zhabei. Each school currently has more than 40 students, and the first class will graduate next month. Among them, Liu Xiuying, a female student in the first school, is already 53 years old, from Jiangbei. She has white hair but is still energetic, and her teeth have not fallen out. Her husband, Huang Jianbiao, is 56 years old and works as a foreman on the wharf. He has three sons who are all wharf workers. Several members of the family are illiterate. Every day, the allocation of wages requires the help of others, which not only costs remuneration but also feels inconvenient. Therefore, the woman decided to enroll in the wharf worker school and asked the teacher to learn accounting and basic arithmetic for the purpose. The wharf business office authorities praised this greatly and gave her a book allowance and instructed the school to give her special treatment. This woman is actually the oldest female student in this city. Compared to the 65-year-old woman in a certain Huangpu school who was regarded by Westerners as the oldest primary school student, they can be called shining brightly one after the other.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School, located at 392 Binlang Road, Pan Garden, has been established for a long time. Nearly 400 graduates have served along the coast and along the river. In view of the importance of kindergarten education and the lack of kindergarten teachers, the school has expanded the three-year system of junior high school level to a four-year system starting from the 20th academic year and has added an undergraduate kindergarten normal school of high school level to recruit junior high school graduates, shorten the time limit, and provide them with two years of training. Starting from the 22nd academic year, the Ministry of Education stipulated that private secondary schools running normal school departments should no longer recruit new students or transfer students, and only the school was allowed to continue to establish it. Its emphasis on kindergarten education can also be seen. It is heard that the school has formulated a plan and expanded greatly in order to meet the demand. In recent days, hundreds of new students and transfer students have gone to register.</p>

<p>The book "High School Entrance Examination Guidance" published by Qinfen Bookstore, No. 392 Labor Father Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is rich in content and well-organized. It is selling extremely well during this entrance examination season. Principal Zheng Xigu of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School praised the book, saying, "The number of middle schools in our country is not large, and each school has limited capacity due to funding and staffing reasons. Therefore, every time during the school season, primary school graduates must pass the 'entrance examination' to enter famous middle schools. However, before the exam, if you do not understand the content, organization, and application procedures of each school, rashly applying for the exam is like 'groping in the dark' and 'finding gold in the sand'. This book, 'High School Entrance Examination Guidance', compiled by Mr. Lu Shaoji, director of the Normal School Department of our school, is comprehensive in its collection and clear in its description. It provides detailed guidance on the preparation, procedures, and coping methods before, during, and after the exam, and includes the secondary education laws and regulations of our country and the situation of secondary schools. It is truly the only masterpiece for young people to study at present. Therefore, I would like to recommend it in a few lines to facilitate education." The actual price of each book is six cents, and the registered postage for mail order is one cent and one point. The bookstore also has a book "University Entrance Examination Guidance", which is also a masterpiece of Mr. Lu Shaoji's meticulous experience. The price is the same as "High School Entrance Examination". The above two books are also available for sale at the bookstore's retail department at 554 Sima Road.</p>

<h3 id="e186">A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medicine in the Last Decade (Continued) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Administration of Medicine, Section Three: Recent Government Orders</p>
<p>I will now summarize the products of these deformed political views, which are the following five government orders suppressing new medicine: (According to my own experience since starting my practice, I have been subjected to one registration law from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Northern Government, one from the Health Bureau during the era of the Shanghai Bund Commissioner, and five from the National Government, for a total of seven times. Fortunately, I have always met the qualifications each time.)</p>
<p>A. The "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Physicians (Western Medicine) by the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau of the National Government" in the 16th and 17th years [of the Republic].</p>
<p>B. The "Provisional Regulations for Physicians" promulgated by the Ministry of Health in the 18th year. The most difficult aspects of this were the issues of being directed by the police and the qualifications. After the Shanghai Medical Association requested leniency for the general practitioners outside the association, the Ministry of Health drafted a petition, but the Executive Yuan rejected it.</p>
<p>C. The "Western Medicine Regulations" promulgated by the National Government on May 7th of the 19th year. However, this regulation stated that the date of implementation would be determined by order. To this day, there has been no order, so it is unknown whether it is in effect or not.</p>
<p>D. The "Regulations for the Higher Examination for Western Medicine Physicians" promulgated by the Examination Yuan on December 27th of the 19th year. This regulation stated that it would be implemented on the day of promulgation, but there has been no examination to this day.</p>
<p>E. The "Measures for Variable Certification of Physicians" passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the Ministry of Interior (naturally drafted by the Department of Health) in the 21st year, which was the result of repeated petitions from the new medical community across the country.</p>
<p>The above government orders have been extensively researched by Dr. Wang Qizhang. He authored an article entitled "Several Doubts Regarding the Qualifications of New Physicians," which was published in the Double Tenth Special Issue of the 21st year and reprinted in the Medical Affairs Compilation, Issue 13. I will take the liberty of extracting a few key points from Dr. Wang's article, which will be sufficient to represent what I want to say, so as not to waste ink in this article. "Among these five public orders, either the later order is issued, and the former order becomes invalid; or the two orders coexist. Needless to say, there is the issue of their retention or abolition, but it is clear that the government authorities have no definite direction or consistent system for managing physicians in these four years."</p>
<p>"The Provisional Regulations for the Management of Physicians (Western Medicine) promulgated by the Health Bureau became invalid after the Provisional Regulations for Physicians of the Ministry of Health were promulgated, but in fact, they have not become invalid."</p>
<p>"What the National Government promulgated was the Western Medicine Regulations, and what the Ministry of Health promulgated was the Provisional Regulations for Physicians. Fortunately, to this day, the National Government has not ordered the date of implementation; otherwise, those who are called physicians would immediately have to be called Western medicine physicians."</p>
<p>"What the Examination Yuan promulgated was the Western Medicine Physician Examination Regulations. Since its promulgation to this day, no Chinese medical practitioners have taken the examination, and it can be said that no one is qualified to practice."</p>
<p>"The clumsy policy of cutting the feet to fit the shoes and restricting the qualifications of physicians is nothing more than a mockery of a few new physicians who have gone astray (referring to those who are not from schools or from unregistered schools?)."</p>
<p>"The current review and examination are all about cleaning up a few new physicians who have already been established, and there is no concrete method to stop unqualified physicians from being produced in the future and to supplement qualified physicians."</p>
<p>"Under one government, it is sometimes tight, sometimes loose; sometimes strict, sometimes laissez-faire, causing a group of people to have unreasonable thoughts and to obtain things by chance."</p>
<p>"Sometimes the municipal government allows him to practice, but the Ministry of Health does not allow him to do so. The feeling of one tightening and one loosening is really unpleasant."</p>
<p>"The variable certification method limits it to those who started practicing before the 18th year and have interned in a hospital for more than five years or graduated from a school for more than four years. Both can obtain certificates, but in society, what about those who do not meet the two qualifications but have already obtained certificates? Furthermore, what is the method to prove that they started practicing before the 18th year?"</p>
<p>Author's Note</p>
<p>(1) My motivation for writing this article for the Shen Bao is entirely based on a certain speech, but when I give speeches, I often do not have a draft. At that time, I spoke casually about what I remembered in the past ten years, so this article is also written casually every week, and there is no complete draft. However, I have unknowingly written tens of thousands of words, and the writing is sloppy and the language is verbose, which is unavoidable. Friends advised me to print it as a separate book after I finish writing it, because I want to put in some investigation efforts recently and try my best to correct the statistics of those hospitals and doctors when it is published.</p>
<p>(2) However, since this article was published up to the 18th issue, a Japanese person named Koyama Kiyotsugu, whom I do not know, divided it into seven sections and translated it in the June issue of the same benevolent Japanese magazine. He has some discrepancies regarding my statistics on the number of doctors and the criticism of the hospitals. I admit that the 3,000 people I mentioned is indeed an approximate number, but there is still discussion about the 3,504 people he counted. Because the regulations on titles are too unclear and the registration is not thorough, there are still doubts about how many people are actually practicing medicine in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Koyama Kiyotsugu's translation first describes the author's position, saying that he is "the chief physician of the Emergency Epidemic Hospital headed by Yu Qiaqing, the backbone of the Zhejiang financial group," which is a misunderstanding. According to the Emergency Epidemic Hospital, it was first founded by my late friend Huang Chu Jiu, who served as the president, and I was a medical director. Mr. Yu was indeed elected as the honorary president. After Mr. Huang passed away, Mr. Du Yuesheng was subsequently elected as the president, and I am now remotely leading the hospital affairs under the name of general manager and do not see patients.</p>
<p>(4) It is because I pay close attention to my society, so even though this article discusses a corner of things, it has also been excerpted and studied by people. I sincerely hope that people in my society will also pay attention to the medical and pharmaceutical issues in the city.</p>
<p>(5) This article was originally planned to be divided into six chapters, including the introductory remarks and the conclusion. Now, some people have advised me to add a description of medical education in the city and the medical and pharmaceutical publications popular in the city, so after the medical administration chapter, I will add another chapter, and the entire article will be seven chapters.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Elements of Diagnosis <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>There are three essentials to diagnosing diseases: precise examination, prudent prescription, and detailed explanation.</p>
<p>(1) Examination</p>
<p>To obtain an accurate diagnosis and a symptomatic prescription, a legal examination is indispensable. Therefore, the examination should be precise and thorough, thoughtful and clear, have unique insights, and a certain procedure.</p>
<p>A. Precise Examination</p>
<p>The first time a patient is examined, a precise observation should be made. If there is any negligence, it will be too late to regret it. If the diagnosis is inaccurate and the medication is wrongly prescribed, the patient will be in danger. The doctor will lose credibility and ruin his reputation. Both parties will suffer.</p>
<p>B. Thorough Examination</p>
<p>When examining a disease, it is not only necessary to diagnose the disease, but also to understand the patient's level of resistance. Therefore, the examination must be detailed and thorough, and avoid exaggeration, emptiness, negligence, and haste. Today's doctors who can complete an examination in five minutes, their lack of thoroughness is obvious.</p>
<p>C. Examination with Unique Insights</p>
<p>For chronic diseases that have been diagnosed and treated by many doctors, do not easily rely on the diagnoses of others without personally examining them. Even if the previous doctor's diagnosis was not wrong, the time may have changed or the current situation may not be consistent. Therefore, the examination must have unique insights.</p>
<p>D. Organized Examination</p>
<p>The doctor should first allow the patient to describe their history and listen patiently. There are three benefits to this: (1) It can add a line of light to the diagnosis. (2) The patient gets mental comfort because the doctor expresses sympathy. (3) The patient increases their faith in the doctor. Then personally ask questions to supplement the patient's incomplete statement. Finally, conduct a physical examination. Physical examination is sometimes particularly difficult. Ordinary patients are accustomed to the simplicity of pulse diagnosis in traditional medicine and are afraid of the detailed examination of modern doctors. The doctor should explain this well. If rejected, then also refuse to prescribe. However, special caution must be taken in the physical examination of women. The presence of a third person is sometimes really necessary. The world is dangerous, and people are cunning. False accusations and framing often occur. To avoid criticism and protect your reputation, you must be cautious.</p>
<p>E. Deliberate and Discriminating Examination</p>
<p>After the examination is completed, the symptoms should be collected, repeatedly studied, the causes of the disease deduced, and an accurate diagnosis sought. If the symptoms are not complete, it is not appropriate to be arbitrary. It is wise to tell the patient directly. Those young and inexperienced doctors are eager for vanity and pretend to know what they do not know, and the result is often incorrect. Therefore, the examination should be thoughtful.</p>
<p>(2) Prescription</p>
<p>The purpose of the doctor's examination and the patient's invitation is nothing more than a prescription, as a tool to attack the disease demon. However, prescriptions do not only rely on medicines. Sometimes dietary restrictions, guidance on hygiene conditions, or correction of the patient's temperament can also have a considerable effect. The common misconception that a prescription is a drug prescription is wrong.</p>
<p>If a prescription needs to be written, then</p>
<p>(1) You must be bold and careful, and examine in detail. Therefore, when prescribing, you should prohibit others from talking and consulting, so as to avoid mistakes. For children: (A) Do not use weight. (B) Make the medicine easy to take.</p>
<p>(2) The handwriting must be clear to avoid errors when dispensing and causing a major mistake. The signature should also not be too cursive so that the pharmacy can easily inquire when there are doubts. After the prescription is completed, it should be read again to avoid any mistakes.</p>
<p>(3) There must be a possibility of implementation. For example, prescribing expensive drugs for poor patients is not only difficult to implement in practice, but also makes the patient feel disappointed.</p>
<p>(3) Prescription Explanation</p>
<p>After the doctor has carefully considered and written a precise prescription in neat handwriting, he should also write detailed instructions on how to take the medicine in Chinese. Then, explain it to the patient or the female caregiver again and again, striving for clarity. However, female caregivers often think they are smart and do not pay attention to the investigation.</p>

<p>Thirteen: Paratyphoid Fever</p>
<p>(Paratyphus; Paratyphoid fever)</p>
<p>Q: What is paratyphoid fever?</p>
<p>A: Paratyphoid fever is very similar to typhoid fever (enteric fever), but the symptoms are milder.</p>
<p>Q: How does paratyphoid fever start?</p>
<p>A: It is also caused by pathogenic bacteria entering the intestine.</p>
<p>Q: Are the pathogenic bacteria the same as the pathogenic bacteria of typhoid fever?</p>
<p>A: No. They are several other bacteria, collectively called paratyphoid bacilli. (Bacillus Paratyphosus)</p>
<p>Q: How many types of paratyphoid bacilli are there?</p>
<p>A: The A and B types that have been discovered now are called paratyphoid bacilli type A and type B.</p>
<p>Q: Where do these bacteria parasitize?</p>
<p>A: They parasitize in pigs, cattle, cats, oysters, milk, fruits, etc. It is also caused by eating carelessly and mixing these foods into the body.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms when paratyphoid fever occurs?</p>
<p>A: Generally, there are two types of symptoms when the disease occurs. One is the typhoid fever type; the other is the gastroenteritis type.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the typhoid fever type?</p>
<p>A: The course of symptoms of this type is similar to that of typhoid fever; but what is unique is that the onset is relatively acute at the beginning, often accompanied by chills, nausea, and vomiting. Fever does not have a fixed pattern like typhoid fever, often presenting as remittent. There are occasional cases of herpes labialis. Splenomegaly is relatively mild. Rose spots are smaller, atypical, and appear in large numbers. The Widal reaction in the urine is rarely positive. The course is short, about two or three weeks. Systemic symptoms are mild, and relapses or complications are rare.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the gastroenteritis type?</p>
<p>A: Patients start with sudden vomiting and diarrhea; the symptoms are very severe, presenting as cholera or dysentery. Most food poisoning is this type. After eating spoiled meat, severe gastrointestinal symptoms suddenly occur within a few hours to ten hours, with fever, and herpes labialis is also seen.</p>
<p>Q: What phenomena do patients with cholera-like paratyphoid fever present?</p>
<p>A: Patients excrete rice-water-like stools in large quantities. They complain of thirst, hiccuping, and sudden loss of strength, loss of voice, and calf muscle cramps.</p>
<p>Q: What phenomena do patients with dysentery-like paratyphoid fever present?</p>
<p>A: Severe colic, stool mixed with mucus and blood, diarrhea, and tenesmus are seen.</p>
<p>Q: How long does the entire course of paratyphoid fever last? What is the outcome?</p>
<p>A: Regardless of the type of paratyphoid fever, it usually takes one week to three weeks to return to normal. Sometimes it lasts for five or six weeks or more, and the patient may fall into exhaustion.</p>
<p>Q: How should paratyphoid fever be accurately diagnosed?</p>
<p>A: Serum should be tested, or a bacteriological examination should be performed on the stool.</p>
<p>Q: How dangerous is this disease?</p>
<p>A: It's okay. But the gastroenteritis type is not good. The mortality rate is about 5%.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment method?</p>
<p>A: For the gastroenteritis type, castor oil should be given at the beginning, and at the same time, the stomach should be washed, activated charcoal should be taken internally, such as Atsu Gen, blood charcoal, etc., and then a mild laxative should be taken. The typhoid fever type can be treated like typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Q: How to prevent paratyphoid fever?</p>
<p>A: Inspect the slaughterhouses and avoid eating undercooked meat. In addition, refer to typhoid fever. (End)</p>

<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>Twenty-three: Diseases of the Breast</p>
<p>(A) Insufficient Breast Milk</p>
<p>Although there is breast milk after childbirth, it is not sufficient, sometimes it stops, or stops completely. This is due to the mother's lack of nutrition or mental stimulation. In addition, if there is excessive fat in primiparous women, or the mammary glands of multiparous women have atrophied because they did not breastfeed last time, these are all causes of insufficient breast milk.</p>
<p>Treatment for insufficient breast milk; in addition to ingesting more nutrients and all symptomatic treatments, artificial sun lamp irradiation can also promote the secretion of mammary glands. However, after a pregnant woman gives birth, she assumes the responsibility of breastfeeding her own child, so insufficient breast milk or complete stoppage after childbirth is unfortunate for the baby. Therefore, the mother should maintain her mind and body during pregnancy to be strong and disease-free, so that the breast milk can be pure and sufficient after childbirth, which is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>(B) Excessive Breast Milk</p>
<p>The secretory function of the mammary glands is extremely vigorous. Breast milk still overflows after breastfeeding, gushing continuously, or it is thin as water, all of which are symptoms of excessive breast milk. Therefore, the mother is often prone to nutritional disorders, anemia, weakness, and other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have excessive breast milk, you should immediately eat less foods that produce milk, or use cloth bandages to tightly press the breasts, or use a breast pump to suck out the breast milk, all of which are possible. If the breasts feel painful, you can apply lard or Vaseline.</p>
<p>(C) Breast Milk Accumulation</p>
<p>If the secretion of the mammary glands is not excreted according to the amount, it will cause symptoms of accumulation, commonly known as breast heat. When breast heat occurs, the mammary glands are tense and feel painful as if they are being pressed. It mostly occurs on the third or fourth day of puerperium. At the same time, the body temperature is often above 38 degrees. You can use wet cloth bandages to press the breasts and take Glauber's salt. If the pain is severe, you can apply belladonna plaster.</p>
<p>(D) Mastitis</p>
<p>Pyogenic bacteria enter through the damaged part of the breast skin, and mastitis is formed. It mostly occurs within the second to sixth week of puerperium. At the beginning, there is high fever and chills, and the breast feels painful, often becoming a diffuse infiltration. If the fever persists, the affected area becomes red and swollen.</p>
<p>After suffering from mastitis, if it is not very serious, there is no need to rush to stop breastfeeding, because sometimes breastfeeding can cure it. However, you need to use a wet cloth ice pack to lift the nipple, or perform a warm compress, and then the tension can be reduced and suppuration can be prevented.</p>
<h3 id="e190">On the Importance of Physical Chemistry and Medicine <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>The level of physics and chemistry courses in our country's middle schools is uneven. Occasionally, a few schools have equipment that is barely satisfactory. However, there are really only a few instruments that can be used by students to do individual experiments, like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, the general knowledge of physics and chemistry of high school graduates is mostly insufficient. Therefore, they must continue to be taught after entering medical school.</p>
<p>Physics deduces the changes in force, and chemistry analyzes the content of matter. In the process of human life, there are extremely complex and subtle changes at all times. All changes are nothing more than force and matter. If you study medicine without starting from physics and chemistry, there is absolutely no possibility of solving it. In the past, a certain British authority on physiology once said that all physiological problems ultimately depend on chemistry and physics to be solved. This is an experienced statement.</p>
<p>According to the two subjects of chemistry and physics, the relationship is the main destiny, not only animals are like this, but plants are also not unique. For example, plants are sown in the ground. If they can suit the soil and climate, the food and nutrients contained in the seeds, such as proteins, hydrogen, oxygen, and sugars, are chemically transformed into roots, beards, stems, and trunks. The roots and beards absorb various minerals from the ground downwards, and the stems and trunks absorb carbon dioxide upwards, so as to flourish and grow. The chemical changes in between are endless. In the past, biologists used microscopes to explore the cells of animals and plants and their tissues, thinking they had succeeded. However, the cells contain countless atoms, and the cells themselves have functions such as breathing and secretion. Metabolism, the transformation and evolution in this, cannot be understood only by relying on microscopes. And the use of chemistry is even more important.</p>
<p>In terms of pharmacology, for example, Atropine can dilate the pupils and invalidate vision. After two or three days, but due to the progress of chemical research, Homatropine was invented. Its effect is equal to Atropine, but vision invalidates for only two or three hours. Another example is morphine, which is a holy drug for pain relief, and at the same time, it has the possibility of addiction. Through chemical research, Codeine was invented. Its effect can sometimes replace morphine without the drawbacks of addiction. Another example is caffeine, which is a diuretic, but its effect is often unreliable. After chemical research, Cocaine was discovered. Its chemical structure is similar to caffeine, but its diuretic effect is better. Later, theophylline was discovered. Its diuretic effect is even more pronounced than Cocaine. Another example is leprosy. Its specific drug is chaulmoogra oil. However, the oil is rich in irritants, which can cause patients to vomit. After chemical research, the components that stimulate vomiting were extracted. Its acidic substances are dissolved in alcohol and can be used for subcutaneous injection, which is a long-term treatment for leprosy. Another example is that the effective atom of quinine is in the CHOH class, and the effect of adrenaline on stimulating the sympathetic nerves is in the Catechol class. To fill the category to the end is countless. Therefore, if you do not know chemistry, but want to study medicine, it is like sailing on a disconnected and exhausted harbor and looking forward to reaching the sea.</p>
<p>Speaking of physics, its importance is equal to chemistry. The human body is like a machine. The wheels and gears are not wrong. In the process of life, cold and heat come and go, and the new replaces the old. The ingenuity of its function is even more amazing than machines. The swinging of the machine without conflict relies on the spring for buffering. The blood in the human body also has a spring for buffering. The so-called Buffer can keep the alkalinity in the blood from drastic changes. The human need for food is like the machine's need for fuel. In the machine, the rotation of the wheels, the discharge of steam, and the movement of the pistons all have rhythms that cannot be disturbed in the slightest. Imitating the human body, the contraction and expansion of the heart, the inhalation and exhalation of breathing, and the secretion of the skin, how can there be the slightest disorder. Therefore, to talk about medicine without learning the principles of physics is to abandon the root and pursue the branch. How can it be helpful?</p>
<p>The importance of chemistry and physics in relation to medicine is so important. Scholars in various countries around the world regard it as a basic science and stipulate that students must study it to a considerable extent before they can study medicine. However, their methods are extremely inconsistent. Britain, Germany, and other countries stipulate that students must continue to take remedial courses in basic science after entering medical school. In the United States, students do not need to take remedial courses after entering medical school after completing the basic science credits in college. Speaking of the German system, the graduates of Ober Realschule are more trained in chemistry, physics, and other subjects than those who graduated from Classical Gymnasunn by more than half. Both types of students must take remedial courses after entering medical school. However, those from Type A schools waste time reviewing old lessons. The American system is more reasonable, but the level and equipment of high schools are extremely uneven. Even in college, the credits taken are not very different in quantity, but the quality is still very uneven. It is not perfect. Although the unevenness of the world's school system has its advantages and disadvantages, the importance of basic science in relation to medicine is undeniable. Studying in school requires knowledge of physics and chemistry to understand. Even if you open a business and ask the world in the future, you will not be able to browse magazines and papers without a considerable level of physics and chemistry. Moreover, students have few opportunities to take remedial courses once they leave school. Therefore, they must have sufficient training before entering medical school.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of Modern Medicine (6) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>Around 1870, the study of infectious diseases caused by trauma was at its peak. Mr. Klebs discovered spherical microbes in suppurative wounds during the Franco-Prussian War. However, some scholars at the time did not believe in the theory of microbes, thinking that infectious diseases of trauma were the result of putrefactive fermentation. It was not until 1876, when Koch discovered the developmental state of the anthrax bacillus, the process of spore formation, and the route of infection in animals, and subsequently discovered various microbes, that microbiology gradually developed.</p>
<p>As for the methods of culturing various microbes, since 1858, liquid culture media, potatoes, gelatin, solidified blood serum, broth, agar, and other culture media have been gradually applied, and various microbes can be cultured using these artificial methods. In terms of microscopic examination, Salomonssen, Koch, Ehrlich, and others used 'aniline' dyes to invent microbial staining methods. In 1884, Gram invented his special staining method. In 1890, Löffler invented a method for staining bacterial flagella.</p>
<p>Pasteur made many contributions to academia throughout his life, the most important of which are the following three:</p>
<p>The first discovery was the fact that [fermentation is caused by the presence of specific microorganisms]. In 1858, Pasteur followed up on his research on tartaric acid fermentation and published a paper on alcoholic fermentation. He discovered that sugar solutions were decomposed into alcohol and carbon dioxide due to the presence of microorganisms, and thus attributed fermentation to the action of microorganisms.</p>
<p>The second discovery was the fact that [infectious diseases are caused by the proliferation of specific microorganisms in the body]. At that time, the French silk industry was greatly affected by silkworm disease. In 1865, the government ordered Pasteur to focus on studying the cause of silkworm disease: after five years of painstaking effort, he discovered two pathogenic microbes and subsequently determined a method of prevention.</p>
<p>His discovery regarding fermentation further led people to think about the study of pathogens, which was a natural trend. At the time, he believed that since the fermentation of lactic acid, alcohol, butyric acid, etc., was caused by the action of microorganisms, then the cause of suppuration might also be due to microorganisms. Thus, he went from being a pure chemist to a biologist and medical scientist. Later, Davaine discovered the anthrax bacillus, Koch successfully purified and cultured the bacillus, and Pasteur repeatedly experimented with the bacillus, confirming it as the pathogenic bacterium of anthrax in 1877. In the same year, he discovered the malignant edema bacillus, which was the first discovery of an anaerobic pathogen. Subsequently, staphylococci and streptococci were discovered. After these pathogenic microbes were discovered one after another, Pasteur abandoned Liebig's chemical contact theory of disease and Virchow's pathogenic cell theory or parasitic cell theory, and confirmed the microbial theory.</p>
<p>The third discovery was the application of prophylactic vaccination. After Pasteur injected the virus of chicken cholera into the body of chickens and saw that they were no longer infected, he came up with the method of prophylactic vaccination. He implemented prophylactic vaccination for anthrax bacillus, reducing the mortality rate of sheep with anthrax from 25-30% to 1%, and the mortality rate of cattle to 0.34%. In addition, he discovered the fact that the virulence of pathogens can change after passing through animal bodies several times. The prophylactic vaccination for rabies is an application of this fact.</p>
<p>In 1867, Sir Joseph Lister, a surgeon in Glasgow, after learning about Pasteur's microbial theory of fermentation, applied antiseptic sterilization methods in surgical operations and achieved good results (see above). Therefore, the development of modern surgery and the glorious development and great progress in practical medicine such as the prevention of traumatic infectious diseases and puerperal fever are all greatly related to Pasteur's research. In this light, isn't Pasteur's contribution extremely great?</p>
<p>Many scholars emerged from Pasteur's school, publishing many extremely valuable achievements, such as Metchnikoff, who founded the phagocytic cell theory, Roux, who discovered diphtheria toxin, Yersin, who discovered the plague bacillus, Calmette, who implemented snake venom prophylactic vaccination, and Chamberland, who invented bacterial filters, all of whom were famous scholars.</p>
<p>Now, let's describe Koch's contributions to microbiology.</p>
<p>Koch's important work was to isolate pathogens, attempt pure culture, determine their pathogenicity, and discover many microbes. Since Koch, the development of microbiology has improved day by day, and the study of pathogens has since had a solid scientific basis; this is worthy of our attention and gratitude.</p>
<p>Comparing the differences between Pasteur and Koch in microbiological research, they are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pasteur mainly used liquid culture media, discovered pathogens through original methods, separated and cultured them, or tested for changes in toxicity. Koch, however, used solid culture media.</p>
<p>(2) Pasteur mainly extracted pure pathogens from living animal bodies or corpses. Koch used the plate culture method to separate and purely culture the specific microbe he wanted to extract from the mixture of various microbes, avoiding the simultaneous occurrence of mixed bacteria.</p>
<p>(3) Pasteur often examined living pathogens under a microscope, while Koch used staining methods to make pathogens easier to see.</p>
<p>In 1882, when Pasteur discovered the pathogen of swine erysipelas and came up with the method of prophylactic vaccination using attenuated pathogens, Koch also discovered the tuberculosis bacillus. In 1884, when Pasteur enthusiastically studied the pathology and treatment of rabies, Koch also devoted all his efforts to studying the treatment and prevention methods of tuberculosis, the great enemy of mankind.</p>
<p>Before Koch, although someone had already discovered the rod-shaped bacterium of anthrax, it was not until 1876 that the pure culture and animal experiments of this pathogenic bacterium were completed by Koch. This was his initial contribution to microbiology. Subsequently, he successively invented the bacterial specimen fixation method, the [aniline] staining method, the photomicrography method, and the research on six pathogens of traumatic infectious diseases, and his reputation grew day by day. In 1881, he invented the pure culture medium; the following year, he discovered the tuberculosis bacillus and invented the dry heat sterilization method; in 1883, he traveled to India and Egypt for academic research and discovered the cholera vibrio and its transmission route; in 1890, he invented tuberculin; in 1892, when cholera was epidemic in Hamburg, he engaged in epidemic prevention work; in 1897, he invented a new tuberculin; in 1906, he studied African sleeping sickness and tried to treat it with [atoxyl]; and in 1905, he won the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Many famous scholars also emerged from Koch's school, such as Gaffky, Löffler, Pfeiffer, Welch, and Kitazato, all of whom made great contributions to microbiology and parasitology. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Xiao Xue</p>
<p>Sitting here bored, I want to write something, but I don't know what to write.</p>
<p>I randomly opened a magazine, and the first thing I saw was a story about Emperor Yang of Sui. It said that Xue Daoheng wrote a good poem, "Swallows' mud falls from the empty beam," and Emperor Yang of Sui, ashamed of his inferiority, killed him and asked his corpse, "Can you still write 'Swallows' mud falls from the empty beam'?" I think this story is not bad, with the charm of Salome kissing John's head. But then I thought that high talent also leads to beheading, and I couldn't help but sigh: it's better not to write!</p>
<p>Because of Emperor Yang of Sui, I thought of Li Houzhu. He was captured and brought south, imprisoned in Jinling, and he was quite depressed, so he poured his feelings into poetry. One day, he was probably full of complaints again, and wrote the line "The old country is unbearable to look back on in the bright moon" in his poem. Who knew he would be killed because of this? Nostalgia is not allowed, and I can't help but feel something again, and sigh again: it's better not to write!</p>
<p>Association is a monster. From Li Houzhu, it jumped very far, and I thought of many literary inquisitions in the Qing Dynasty, such as "Lu Lijin's Snow Crime Travelogue," "Record of the Case of the Fang and Dai Families in Tongcheng," and even the far-fetched bloody cases of the "Gentle breeze does not know characters, why does it turn the pages of the book?" I feel that literary people are truly at the end of the road. Except for being dogs, they have no freedom. One careless stroke can lead to decapitation, and I can't help but feel sad and sigh three times: it's better not to write!</p>
<p>In fact, not writing doesn't guarantee that you won't be killed. I remember a few years ago in Anhui, someone was arrested for a bottle of red ink; in Hunan, someone was killed for reading Guo Moruo's "Fallen Leaves"; in Jiangwan, a student was detained for three weeks for having a Soviet novel. Writing is extremely dangerous, and reading behind closed doors can also lead to unexpected disasters. Where do the intellectual classes ultimately go? Here, I can't help but praise Hitler's sagacity and decisiveness. Like Qin Shihuang, burning books and burying scholars is a more thorough solution. The affair of beheading for writing, I don't know the gains and losses, I put the book aside, it's better not to write!</p>
<p>The poet Han Qibo from my hometown said: "Outside the window, the sky is like ink, a lamp shines sadly like a flower, wanting to talk about the future, my heart is already as chaotic as hemp." The poet's state of mind is truly sad. Although the heart is as chaotic as hemp, the road ahead must still be opened up. The road is full of thorns, and knives and guns are against our necks, but we still have to advance with blood. But "A scholar is worth nothing," it's better not to write!</p>
<p>Sitting here bored, I want to write something, what should I write?</p>
<h3 id="e193">"Translation" and "Compilation" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Jing said the following on the "Free Talk" the other day about "compilation" and "writing": "People who are undertaking the task of cultural movement now, instead of focusing on translating foreign masterpieces, why not take the time to do some work of compilation and rewriting." Because of many hard-to-read hard translations, I agree with his view, and I have expressed the same opinion when the popular edition of "Destruction" came out. However, at the same time, I can't help but have some doubts:</p>
<p>If many people who are doing hard translations and random translations were to switch to doing "compilation and rewriting," would they be competent? We know that if you have a deeper understanding of a work when translating it, no matter how profound the work is, no matter how different the Chinese and foreign grammars and customs are, it will never be as stiff as many current translations are, making people afraid to understand. I heard that there are many translators now who don't even bother to read the original work from beginning to end. They open the first line and translate, and there is no way to talk about understanding the original work. I heard a joke that an old bookstore owner read the Chinese translation of Gorky for forty years and said that Gorky's articles were not well written. Therefore, "these books have no sales at all," and what is negotiable is not the translation work itself, but the attitude of translation.</p>
<p>However, because of the separation of habits, customs, etc., even very faithful translations often cannot be understood by those who lack preparatory knowledge. If someone can do the work of summary and popular compilation, such as the popular edition of "Destruction" and "The Iron Flood," it is also very important at the moment. But I think this compilation work is really much more difficult than translation. If you also use the attitude of hard translation and random translation to do it, the result will definitely be worse. Maybe "summary" will become "fragmentation," and "popularization" will become "vulgarization" or "distortion." Because here, in addition to a deep understanding of the original work, a comprehensive education is even more needed. For example, we already have many translations and summaries about "dialectical materialism," but it is difficult to find a popular small booklet on this theory compiled by ourselves. There is no other reason, because the person who can make a popular explanation of the most profound theories is the person who can have the most profound research on this theory. Obviously, we still lack scholars who can conduct thorough and painstaking research on a theory and apply it at will.</p>
<p>So, overall, the problem is not in translation or compilation, but in the attitude of scholars in researching academics!</p>
<h3 id="e194">About Lan Caihe <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dian</p>
<p>The previous article "Lan Caihe is Not a Fairy" only cited Lu You's "Southern Tang Book" as evidence. Trivial matters are not worth arguing about, which is the first meaning. Moreover, the theory of immortals is absurd and difficult to verify, and whether Lan Caihe himself exists is still questionable, so how can we have time to distinguish whether he is male or female? The reason why I argue even when it is unnecessary to argue is that I compare myself to Zhuangzi, who thought the world was turbid and could not be discussed with Zhuangzi. I didn't expect that the madman's dream could not be said in front of him, and it actually brought out many wonderful theories from people like Hu Huaichen.</p>
<p>Zhao Yi's "Gaiyu Congkao" Volume 34, roughly says that there are two female immortals in the popular legend of the Eight Immortals, Lan Caihe and He Xiangu. It also says that Yuan Yishan has the sentence "I am surprised that Bai Yu is ahead of Pan Yue, and people laugh at the blue shirt like Caihe." His inscription on Lan Caihe's portrait says: "The long board sings without madness, and the children are busy for a hundred coins. When will I meet the old man in the blue shirt and dance with him in the spring breeze?" It is Lan Caihe is a man. Today's operas forcibly dress him as a woman, which is even more ridiculous." Zhao Yi has already investigated that Lan Caihe is not a female immortal, but the compilers of modern literary dictionaries do not know this. I pointed it out, but some people came forward to argue, and I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Regarding Lan Caihe, Zhao Yi's "Gaiyu Congkao" has omissions, so I will add a few more details. "Shuofu" Volume 43, Tang Shen Fen's "Continued Biographies of Immortals," lists sixteen people who ascended to immortality, with a note saying "Three women inside." These three people are listed at the end, namely Xie Ziran, Pei Xuanjing, and Qi Xiaoyao. As for Lan Caihe, he is listed second among the sixteen people, saying that he is "unknown from where." Shen Fen, who lived in the remnants of the Tang and Five Dynasties, did not know who Lan Caihe was, but he had already affirmed that Lan Caihe was a male immortal, which is clearly evident. Also, upon investigation, the Yuan Dynasty miscellaneous drama included an anonymous "Han Zhongli Du Lan Caihe," in which Lan Caihe appeared and said: "My surname is Xu, my name is Jian, and my stage name is Lan Caihe. My whole family is fond of a thousand gold, and the son born is Xiao Caihe, and the daughter-in-law is Lan Shan Jing." From Shen Fen, Lu You, to Yuan Yishan and others, they all said that Lan Caihe was a male immortal, so it can be known that in the legends of the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties, Lan Caihe was still not a female immortal. Zhao Yi said that it is popularly said that Lan Caihe is a female immortal, and that today's operas forcibly dress him as a woman. Then, the theory that Lan Caihe is a female immortal probably originated in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Since He is planning to write about the Eight Immortals, will he have an answer as to whether Lan Caihe is male or female among the Eight Immortals? We can wait for it.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Pearl S. Buck, Author of "The Good Earth" (Continued) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xian</p>
<p>After marrying Professor John Lossing Buck, Head of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Nanjing and Jinling University, she gave birth to a daughter who was very good-looking but suffered from a disability from birth. Ms. Buck had to send her to a specialized educational institution in the United States to spend her lonely life there. However, Ms. Buck was always concerned about the future of this poor daughter. "I have to raise enough money for this daughter's lifetime expenses before I can feel at ease! But Mr. Buck's teaching income is very limited, and I am penniless, so where will I get so much money? I think I should work hard to write and use the profits from writing to solve this problem."</p>
<p>These frank words were said by Ms. Buck to Mr. Long Moxiong, a strike friend, who helped her collect materials for the history of Chinese novels.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1927, the Nanjing Incident broke out, and Ms. Buck took refuge in Shanghai, living in a small Western-style house next to Shanzhong Road, where she devoted herself to writing. Her first published novel, "East Wind: West Wind," was completed that year.</p>
<p>In the spring of the following year, the situation stabilized, and Ms. Buck returned to Nanjing and continued to engage in long-form writing. She got up every morning, washed and dressed briefly, and went to a small room on the third floor to write at her desk, returning to the upstairs after breakfast until noon, when she stopped writing, and then did other things in the afternoon. Under these circumstances, "The Good Earth," which later caused a sensation in the European and American literary circles, was produced.</p>
<p>"East Wind: West Wind" describes the conflict between new and old ideas in a Chinese family in the form of a self-narrative by Guilan, a traditional Chinese woman. With its oriental atmosphere and beautiful writing, this novel received rave reviews from British and American newspapers after its publication. But the work that gave her a definite reputation in the American literary world and made her a fortune was "The Good Earth." "The Good Earth" was published in New York in March 1931 and was selected as a masterpiece by the New Book Selection Committee organized by the American publishing industry. Soon after, she won the 1931 Pulitzer Prize for Literature. Although the amount of this prize was only 5,000 US dollars, it was very reputable in the United States, and the glory was extraordinary. The structure of "The Good Earth" is based on the life of a farmer and woven with the disasters of droughts, floods, soldiers, and bandits. What the author has grasped are simply the most serious problems currently facing poor China. The protagonist, Wang Lung, can be regarded as the model of the peasants who make up the majority of China's population. The first half of his life represents the hunger and poverty of the peasants, while the second half represents the wealthy peasants with a comfortable life. The author broke away from the causal moral concept of "diligence and thrift leads to wealth," and instead used the riots of urban slum dwellers as the turning point in Wang Lung's life. This is where the author's greatness lies. Perhaps because she strived to cater to the tastes of the American public, the author portrayed Chinese ethics and etiquette too excessively, and her description of the sexual psychology of Chinese people who worship Lin Daiyu-style female beauty also seemed somewhat unnatural. Therefore, our country's readers are often not very satisfied with the second half of "The Good Earth." However, from a critical point of view, the success of "The Good Earth" is obviously not in those love scenes, but in the touching descriptions of the tragic famines. Such a novel depicting poverty finally made the author a rich person in a world of economic downturn. This was indeed beyond the author's expectations. The author now no longer needs to worry about her poor daughter's lifetime expenses, and like the situation when Wang Lung was about to leave the big city in the south, she suddenly got a lot of gold coins, enough for her to travel long distances in Europe and the United States and live a prosperous life in the future.</p>
<p>"The Good Earth" more or less changed Westerners' views of our country, and the actual impact is worth noting. In the autumn of 1931, just when "The Good Earth" was popular in the United States, our country suffered a serious flood. In the relief funds received by the government from abroad, donations from Americans accounted for the majority. According to the letter written to the author by the president of the American Red Cross, the reason was that the story of the Wang Lung family encountering drought deeply moved Americans.</p>
<p>Following "The Good Earth," "Sons" was published. This describes the lives of Wang Lung's three sons after his death. The three of them represent Chinese gentry, merchants, and warlords. However, the author obviously does not have the same sympathy and understanding for these types of Chinese people as she does for the peasants, and therefore it was not as successful as "The Good Earth." Ms. Buck returned to the United States with Mr. Buck in July 1930 and personally witnessed the popularity of her work there. She just left the United States in late June this year. Now she is probably traveling in Europe. In the near future, we will be able to see this happy female writer who considers China her "second motherland." This time when she comes to China again, she will definitely be able to recognize this old, big, and poor China more deeply, so her future works may retain the advantages of "The Good Earth" and eliminate the shortcomings. While welcoming this kind author with enthusiasm, we can't help but hold this hope.</p>

<p>— Yun Guo Sun</p>
<p>"That's a good idea!" Zhi Guang couldn't help but jump up with joy.</p>
<p>"Then shouldn't we complete the formalities now so that we can go to Zhabei tomorrow..."</p>
<p>Before Bo Tang could finish his words, the door of the study suddenly opened, and Pei Huang, carrying a hot water bottle that was more than a foot long and wearing a pair of leather rabbit shoes, walked into the room unhurriedly. She heard Bo Tang's unfinished sentence and asked...</p>
<p>"Going to Zhabei again?"</p>
<p>"That's right," Bo Tang said.</p>
<p>"Is your conversation over?"</p>
<p>"Not yet... but there is already a way to end it."</p>
<p>"How to end it?"</p>
<p>"Go to Zhabei! That's how to end it."</p>
<p>"Didn't Zhi Guang already go? Who is going now?"</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>"When are you going?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"Nonsense... Zhi Guang ran away, which has already worried people a lot. It's hard to come back safely and peacefully, and now you say you want to go again, you must have eaten too much... This is really nonsense! You should listen to the sound of the cannons outside today. It's never been this loud!" Everyone listened carefully, but they didn't hear anything. Then Lian Pei Huang became suspicious. Finally, Bo Tang said with a smile...</p>
<p>"It's another castle in the air!"</p>
<p>"A castle in the air! You didn't hear it. Just now, when I was talking to them on the third floor, I really heard it very clearly. That kind of bi bi ba ba sound like boiling porridge, I don't care about it. What makes people annoyed the most is the peng peng peng one after another cannon sounds. It's never been this loud..."</p>

<p>(I) The London Conference Has Failed Again</p>
<p>In June 1932, the Lausanne Conference attempted to revive the world economy. On July 9, five agreements were established. The achievements were minimal, but hope remained in the fifth item, which called for the League of Nations to convene another world economic conference. In June of this year, this large-scale world economic conference was held in London, gathering elites from sixty-six nations, spending thirty-eight days of time. Capitalist gold standard kingdoms, socialist red internationals, and even those who were usually not considered for world conferences were invited to participate, forging together in one furnace, a grand and prosperous gathering. It was expected to resolve disagreements and cure incurable diseases. However, due to presumptuous self-confidence and infighting, the conference was fraught with difficulties. Consequently, it was adjourned on the 27th of this month. The outcome? Needless to say. Reopening the conference is a futile dream. Now, let's examine the important issues of this London Conference and briefly discuss its failure, which I believe is also of concern to the readers.</p>
<p>(I) Tariffs. Tariff wars have always been a common term in economic history. However, the breadth and depth of these wars have never been as severe as in recent years. The construction of tariff barriers is almost universal. (China, with its incomplete tariff autonomy, cannot be considered in the same light.) It is said that the current tariff war tactics employed by various countries range from common strategies such as prohibiting imports, limiting imports, increasing tariffs, encouraging exports, and reciprocal treatment, to special strategies such as state-run trade and state-run exchange. If broken down, there could be more than two hundred types. This is no exaggeration. Every country seeks to increase its exports while reducing its imports. The international trade arena is filled with countless barriers. The international trade index has been decreasing year by year, with the Soviet Union being the only exception. As a result, countries are greatly concerned about the problem of falling prices and the increasing number of unemployed. Commentators attribute the economic panic to tariff wars. However, no country is willing to dismantle its barriers first, and every country hopes that others will dismantle theirs first. Therefore, the London Conference focused on this issue. When the United States proposed a 10% reduction in tariffs, there was an uproar. The Japanese Empire, which considers itself the "Germany of the East," was particularly opposed. The countries that advocated for the removal of tariff barriers were generally doing so for others. What they hoped for from other countries was merely a 10% reduction, while for their own countries, they would maintain their existing barriers as the lowest line of defense. As a result, the tariff issue had to be withdrawn. Commentators said that the United States proposed tariff reductions because it had already gained a new weapon (devaluation of the gold standard), and no longer needed to maintain full tariff barriers to prevent imports. The opposition of France, Japan, and many other countries to a general reduction was because the United States was using the sharp decline in the gold standard exchange rate to vigorously develop exports, and tariffs were necessary to counteract this. Therefore, France often said that tariff discussions should take place after the exchange rate problem is resolved. Since the United States was unwilling to participate in a stable exchange rate policy, France, Japan, and other countries were also unwilling to lower their tariffs. Each country prioritized its own interests, making a resolution hopeless.</p>
<p>(II) Exchange Rates. The deviation of exchange rates from the norm has been long-standing. Since countries began to prohibit the export of gold, the disorder has worsened. Exchange rate policies are often subject to unpredictable changes, which constrain international investment and trade, and disrupt the international economic chain. Commentators often dream of the prosperity before the war, believing that the instability of exchange rates hinders the recovery of the world economy. However, after countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan prohibited the export of gold and devalued their foreign exchange rates, the international market prices of their commodities fell significantly, which helped their foreign trade. Therefore, regarding exchange rate psychology, they only hope that other countries will adjust, but are unwilling to raise their own rates, which is the same as the tariff issue. Since the recent economic panic in the United States, the gold standard was suspended, the currency was inflated, and the exchange rate of the gold dollar fell sharply. The international market price of American goods suddenly plummeted. Its exports were like a fierce tiger unleashed, invincible. Countries realized that their own exchange rate policies were insufficient to compete with the United States, so they proposed stabilization policies at the London Conference, with France as its leader. However, the United States regarded this as a weapon and was unwilling to give it up. As a result, the so-called international central bank system, international exchange rate fund system, and exchange rate agreements all became empty talk. The exchange rate problem ultimately vanished. The silver problem is a subset of the exchange rate problem and was also an important issue at the London Conference. Today, countries that use silver, such as China, India, and many other weak countries, are rich in silver reserves. The total population and total consumption power are astonishing. However, due to the drastic fall in silver prices, purchasing power has inevitably decreased. Countries that use gold, frustrated with the tariff and exchange rate issues, retreated to the silver problem, seeking a way out. The consensus was that if silver prices rose, it would develop the export trade of countries that use silver, and the cause of the world economic panic could be somewhat resolved. Thus, the Silver Subcommittee was established, and the Eight-Nation Agreement gradually emerged. Weak countries that use silver were fortunate that major gold-using countries were condescending and offering assistance, but they did not realize that they were opening up export markets for gold-using countries. How sad.</p>
<p>(III) War Debts. War debts have dominated the world economy for more than a decade. The United States is a creditor nation, Germany is a debtor nation, and the United Kingdom is a debtor to the United States and a creditor to other countries. France, Italy, and Belgium are creditors to Germany but debtors to the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result of offsetting debts and credits, Germany is undoubtedly a debtor, and France and Italy are also purely debtor nations. The United Kingdom is an intermediary country for debts and credits. Only the United States holds enormous credits, long dominating the world economy. European countries almost all rely on its decisions. Since the world economic panic of 1929, the finances of various countries have deteriorated daily. The issue of war debts has gradually become a problem that can be re-examined. However, the United States is using this to dominate the world and has not allowed the reduction of credits. After the expiration of Hoover's one-year moratorium plan in 1931, the United States repeatedly demanded repayment, while European debtor countries were reluctant. The London Conference first mentioned war [debts]. This was [omitted characters] and ultimately could not forget about revising [omitted characters]. The United States firmly opposed, and the war debt issue at the London Conference was like a fleeting glimpse.</p>
<p>The above issues encompass the important agendas of the London Conference, and it can be said that almost nothing was achieved. In addition, agreements such as the Wheat Agreement had minimal impact, and the resolution to curb investment was mere formality. Limiting production was even more empty talk. The failure of the conference is beyond doubt. The key to its failure was that each country sought to benefit itself at the expense of others, ultimately leading to mutual contradictions and achieving nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e198">(II) Economic Warfare or Military Warfare? <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The convocation of world economic conferences is not a one-time event. The 1927 Geneva Conference was attended by fifty countries. At that time, although there were relatively concrete resolutions on tariff issues, after the meeting, tariff wars intensified. Subsequently, the Danube Conference and the Lausanne Conference had fewer participating countries, and the results were also very superficial. In recent months, with the United States suspending the gold standard, the world economy has become more depressed. The inability of the London Conference to fully meet expectations is not surprising. However, before the conference, countries had some expectations. They were restraining their policies, waiting for a change in the atmosphere during the conference. Now that the conference has ended in failure, most countries, either seeing the unwillingness of other countries to compromise or feeling their own backwardness, will abandon their illusions of international coordination and seek their own ways to revive. Then, the hideous face of capitalism will inevitably be increasingly exposed, and the following three paths will be inevitable:</p>
<p>(I) The Rise of Controlled Economy. Since the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, although the world has felt the economic panic, it has been able to develop production and increase exports. Therefore, capitalist countries that oppose communism have also begun to advocate for economic control. They believe that the past development of capitalism focused on the rationalization of production, but there was no comprehensive plan for the national economy. As a result, the more rationalized each production enterprise became, the more irrational the national economy became. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the national front and seek economic control. From production enterprises to national trade and finance, everything should be subject to government control. This policy is essentially state capitalism. European and American countries have already adopted parts of it, such as exchange rate management. Now that the London Conference has failed, the international situation has become more tense. The scope of national control may expand.</p>
<p>(II) The Resumption of Trade and Financial Warfare. Tariff wars, exchange rate wars, dumping policies, and gold seizure policies in recent years are all related to trade and financial warfare. Tariffs are the center of trade warfare, and exchange rates are the center of financial warfare. Therefore, the London Conference addressed these issues first. Now that the conference has failed, the trend of international confrontation is becoming more apparent. World trade and finance have clearly lost their chain. Countries almost all feel the need to address overproduction and low prices, and strive for a trade surplus. In finance, they all seek to accumulate gold reserves to improve their national credit system. The continuation of tariff and exchange rate wars is inevitable. The overall trade and financial relations between countries may inevitably enter a state of war. In an era of rising economic control ideology, this kind of warfare is most likely.</p>
<p>(III) The Struggle for Markets. In recent years, countries have suffered not from a lack of production, but from the narrowness of sales channels. The most important goal of the London Conference was to remove obstacles to international trade and promote trade activities. Unfortunately, due to the unwillingness of countries to compromise, various obstacles have not been reduced. Moreover, since the outcome of the conference was poor, new obstacles will arise in the future. In disappointment, countries will inevitably engage in the struggle for markets to seek new economic colonies, or exclude the competition of other countries to seek exclusive control of existing markets. In the era of economic control and trade financial warfare, this kind of struggle is inevitable. The result may lead to military warfare. The fuse for the Second World War will be planted here.</p>
<p>The above three items can be summarized into two backgrounds. (I) The development of state capitalism... All national economic control, external aggression in trade and finance, and the struggle for economic colonies are characteristics of state capitalism. What the Soviet Union has done in recent years is no different. Although it claims to be communist domestically, it is a state capitalist country in the world economic arena. Because the state capitalism of various countries is not yet complete, the Soviet Union can gain an advantage in the world economic battlefield. Today, although countries avoid mentioning communism, they are all progressing in this direction. In the subsequent development process, the countries with the most developed statism will have the advantage, and there is a possibility of local prosperity in the world economy. However, as time passes, the international economy will be filled with these countries, and they will feel the lack of room for development. Although the economy of each country is rationalized (?), the economy of the whole world will inevitably feel irrational one day. Then the economic panic will inevitably overflow and become uncontrollable. Economists often say that although capitalism develops, it will inevitably self-destruct one day. This is the common conclusion obtained from academic research. (II) The formation of the International Confrontation Front... The situation of international confrontation will intensify due to the lack of coordination at the London Conference. Those with the same interests will inevitably unite to confront their common enemy. Europe already has this situation. The transformation of the international confrontation front from fragmented to integrated, from thin to thick, is undoubtedly inevitable. Reciprocal trade and financial alliances are inevitable trends. Moreover, the war debt problem has been a dispute for many years. The attitude of the United States at this conference has been watched by European countries, but there is nothing they can do. In the future, due to the struggle for economic hegemony and the distinction of war debt interests, the major opposing fronts in the international economy will become more prominent. The result will inevitably lead to military warfare, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In short, in the future, countries will inevitably fall into the war of state capitalism without realizing it. Even the Soviet Union, which claims to be communist, cannot escape this. Although countries will strive to improve their domestic economic policies, the direction they are heading is wrong, and the fall is only a matter of time. In the meantime, many natural resources will inevitably be wasted and many human lives will be hindered. Westerners often [believe in] the creator, and there is God; then God is foolish.</p>
<h3 id="e199">(III) Not Worried About Poverty But Worried About Inequality <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>By exploring the economic policies of various countries before and after the London World Economic Conference, we not only feel their hideousness and fear, but also pity their ignorance and foolishness. I, a humble scholar, believe that there is still a way to change course. Please allow me to elaborate:</p>
<p>People often talk about economic panic, thinking that the situation is precarious and unsustainable. But let us try to examine whether the supply of materials is sufficient to meet the needs of human life. According to world statistics, the increase rate of population and materials in the world from 1925 to 1931 is as follows:</p>
<p>Population 5% Raw materials 25%</p>
<p>Food 10%</p>
<p>It can be seen that human life is not likely to experience poverty, so what is there to panic about? This is what is known as "those who produce are many, and those who consume are few." Since Malthus's theory of population was introduced, people have feared that the population would increase geometrically, while materials would only increase arithmetically. After witnessing the productivity of the industrial revolution, they realized that it was a needless worry. Today, the increase in goods is clearly greater than the population. However, countries are loudly complaining about the economic panic, the large number of unemployed, and poverty. At the same time, they are recording the increasing rate of inventories, the declining prices, and the artificial methods of suppressing production. Is this not strange? Materials are not insufficient, but the majority of the population feels insufficient consumption, and the unemployed have nothing to live on. Capitalists who accumulate inventories often complain about the excessive productive capacity and the insufficient turnover of funds. They even destroy some of their goods to prevent price declines. As a result, there are those who cause price declines due to sluggish sales and delay repayment of debts. There are those who affect the financial world due to the collapse of credit. There are those who cause tariff problems due to the promotion of foreign exports and the restriction of imports. There are those who cause exchange rate problems due to the instability of trade and finance. There is unemployment due to limited production or business failure. There are [omitted characters] due to the decline of the economy, and there are financial defects. There are those who cause currency inflation due to financial defects, or unstable markets and finance. There are also those who, due to currency inflation, lead to disputes over international exchange finance and trade. The root cause of the recent new world economic panic is nothing more than this. The root cause is purely unequal distribution. Only with unequal distribution do capitalists focus only on surplus value, so there is so-called overproduction. Only with unequal distribution do workers and the general middle and lower classes have no surplus purchasing power, so there is so-called material surplus. The Great Learning says, "Not worried about poverty but worried about inequality." The pathology of the world economy can be viewed in this way. Since the disease lies in "inequality," it should be treated with "equality." Therefore, if we want to save the world economy from disaster, we should have the production and distribution of the economy managed by society. Make everyone do their best and make the best use of their goods. Rivalry and contention have no way to profit. And the hideous face of capitalism will disappear by itself. I, a humble scholar, believe that countries should realize this and move in this direction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the financial defects of various countries are also a factor contributing to economic panic. Currency inflation is inevitable. Even the raising of tariffs is sometimes due to fiscal reasons. The root cause of financial defects is militarism. War debts are only a small part of it. According to a survey by the League of Nations, 70% of the budgets of European Christian countries are spent on past and future expenses. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer also said in 1930 that global military spending reached 900 million gold pounds annually. The direct harm of militarism to the economy is already like this. The indirect harm must be even more alarming. Therefore, I believe that countries should immediately change their policies, and even the smallest effect can prevent the economy from becoming bleak again. However, at a time when countries are selfishly using their own interests, they are using military force as a backing for their economic warfare, so this level is difficult to achieve before policies are changed. Therefore, to get to the root of the problem, we should still focus on the economic reforms mentioned above. Japan is too busy seeking expansion, so there is no possibility of reducing [military spending]. This is why the disarmament conference has not achieved anything, and the world disaster is difficult to eliminate.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Main Reason for the Failure of the Economic Conference by Chu <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the London World Economic Conference on June 12, it has been more than a month, and it is difficult to achieve the expected results. This has been known for some time. Now, the economic conference has ended in failure. There are many reasons for its failure, and the biggest reason is that the purpose of the conference was not a purely economic issue, but was mixed with political functions. At the beginning of the conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald pretended to raise the issue of war debts in the political aspect. Although this issue was not on the agenda, France soon raised the issue of European political stability, which was more important to the conference; and President Roosevelt raised the issue of non-aggression treaties; The German representatives proposed the recovery of the old German colonial territories, etc., which suddenly changed the situation of the conference. Using the Quadripartite Agreement of England, Germany, France, and Italy as a wedge, the countries that stabilized the European political situation and sought to revise the peace treaties, such as Germany and Italy, were in opposition to the opinions of France, Poland, and the Little Entente countries. The responsibility country using the Quadripartite Agreement as a wedge was originally in the Little Entente countries. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Benes was the most opposed to the Quadripartite Agreement. This is because Germany advertises absolute nationalism and wants to restore national power with strength. On the one hand, it rejects Jews, and on the other hand, it implements political party isolation, which are all manifestations of pursuing far-reaching goals. In this unstable situation, the success of an economic conference that takes the stability of the European political situation as a premise is possible? The failure of the disarmament conference is the cause of the European political unrest. The failure of the disarmament conference is a major obstacle to the economic conference. As a result, all countries have formed economic alliances based on their own interests in order to consolidate themselves. Such as the union of the United Kingdom with Canada, Australia, India, South Africa, Rhodesia, and other autonomous colonial territories; France's union with French Indochina, Algeria, and with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and other colonies with close ties; the United States' union with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and other South American countries; The union of Germany with Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Such opposing unions and alliances all adopt exclusive policies with economic nationalism. The two major propositions of the United States' currency inflation! Raising prices, and France's stable currency, to control production, are the major reasons for the failure of this conference. Therefore, if we truly want to save the world economy from its predicament, we must first abolish this kind of union control. Otherwise, all [countries] will go to extremes, despise international coordination, and be eager for economic nationalism, then the future of the world economy will be even more unimaginable. After economic integration, countries will inevitably set up preferential tariffs, or agree on reciprocal tariffs, or raise tariffs on third countries, and devote themselves to market competition. As a result, the world's finances will inevitably fall into a state of chaos, and the industrial economy of various countries will gradually decline.</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Glimpse of Peiping's Social Economy (Continued) by Cheng Wen-ai <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>(1) Discount interest is divided into two types: cash (i.e., silver dollars) and transfer (i.e., checks). A handling fee of five cents per thousand yuan is charged.</p>
<p>(2) Remittances are divided into Tianjin and Shanghai. A handling fee of five cents per thousand yuan is also charged.</p>
<p>(3) Currency is divided into three types: Shanghai banknotes, Shanxi banknotes, and other banknotes. A handling fee of five cents per thousand yuan is charged. In addition, Peiping City has a stock exchange, established in 1918, with a capital of 600,000 yuan. Besides trading public bonds and treasury bills, only Qixin shares are listed. The years 1924, 1925, and 1926 were the most prosperous, with spot transactions being the most common. Transactions were relative, not competitive. Trading hours were after 12:00 noon daily. The exchange assumes full supervisory responsibility for both buyers and sellers. If one party breaches the contract, the exchange can compensate the other party for the losses suffered, and the exchange then recovers all losses from the breaching party. For stock transactions, a cash deposit of 400 yuan is required for every 10,000 yuan. The handling fee is five jiao per 5,000-yuan face value, collected from both buyers and sellers. The quota for brokers is 60, with each broker required to have a cash deposit of 5,000 yuan and be introduced by at least two members of the Brokers Association. After passing the examination, they are submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval before being recognized. Most of these brokers are silver firms, also operating this business. Currently, there are only a little over ten brokers remaining at the exchange, likely due to the decline of the market. As for Peiping's local financial issue, it is the copper coin problem. In recent years, because there have been many foreign copper coins, mostly from Tianjin, the authorities have banned them. If copper coins flood the market, small business owners and laborers will be the first to suffer, which would greatly affect society. As for the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, it has already been implemented de facto in Peiping. Currently, all transactions are without the tael unit, perhaps because Peiping does not have foreign exchange constraints!</p>
<p>5. Public Utilities and Labor-Management Issues Peiping's tram company is a joint venture between the government and merchants. The government shares are funded by the Sino-French Bank. There are not many tram lines in the city, and the tramcars are old. However, the passengers are very crowded, so its operating income is likely good. The tram uses a siren to signal departure, which is the same as the siren used in the city for emergencies. I think this is inappropriate. Electricity and tap water are entirely commercial, with the government only in a supervisory position. What is the scale and equipment of these public utilities? Because I have not visited them, I cannot speculate or criticize. However, according to a survey of tap water users in Peiping, the water supplied by the tap water company is very unclean, with a lot of yellow mud in the water. It must first be stored in a tank and allowed to settle before it can be used. This is also an area that public utilities should improve. As for Peiping, because there is a lack of large public factories, labor-management issues rarely occur. The only organized unions are the Tram Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Union. When disputes occasionally arise, they can usually be resolved peacefully. It can be said that there have been no real labor strikes in Peiping in recent years.</p>
<p>6. Overview of the Standard of Living | | Conclusion</p>
<p>Due to the relocation of the capital, the general standard of living in Peiping has dropped a lot. Just take rent as an example. In the past, because it was the political center, there were many people chasing officialdom, so the demand for housing exceeded the supply, and rents could be increased as much as possible. However, after the political center moved south, the officials moved with it, so the supply of housing suddenly exceeded the demand, and rents fell by an unknown amount. Housing is no longer valuable, and land prices have also fallen. The fall in land prices has further reduced rents. Currently, the rent for a room in Peiping is no more than one yuan per month, and there are still concerns about not having customers. Since the September 18th Incident, residents of the Northeast have flocked to Peiping to seek refuge, which has increased the population of Peiping a lot. In other words, the need for housing has also increased a lot. However, speaking of this, there is an interesting thing worth mentioning: the general landlords in Peiping do not welcome Northeastern residents very much, because once they rent a place to live, they will never pay rent again, and the landlords are helpless. Although, there is something to discuss about this, because the general Northeastern residents have lost their real estate and farmland, and are displaced disaster victims. How should they be relieved? However, there must be concrete measures for government relief, otherwise, allowing them to disrupt the local social order is the fault of the authorities. In addition, the living conditions of rickshaw pullers can be used as an example. First, take Shanghai as an example. These people walk quickly, sweating profusely. Due to the high cost of living, they work all day, and may not even be able to eat their fill. Peiping is different. The deep impression we have of these rickshaw pullers is that they are neatly dressed and their rickshaws are beautiful. Some of their rickshaws are self-provided, and some are rented from others. The rent is at most twenty or thirty cents a day, and a small amount only requires fifty or sixty copper coins, so they can live comfortably as long as they earn five or six jiao a day. As mentioned above, the wages of workers in Peiping are generally only five or six yuan per month, which is very different from Shanghai. Finally, in a summary, it is a great pity that our country has so much cheap labor and does not use it to develop our country's industry! (End)</p>

<p>The bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange last week was quite stable. It was observed that there was still a peaceful path, and the lost land in Luandong was gradually being recovered. Moreover, since the July futures had been settled on Friday for delivery, trading restrictions were until Tuesday, so the market had a phenomenon of squeezing shorts and longs at the beginning of the week, but there were no drastic rises or falls. Major changes often occur around delivery, but this time it was calm.</p>
<p>Based on the high price level, there should be more longs. Based on the trend of people's hearts, shorts will be squeezed. However, large short positions were prepared early. Most of the floating shorts from the previous week had been closed or rolled over, so this squeeze was relatively peaceful. Only on Monday, as there was still hope for a peaceful solution in the inspection situation, longs and shorts rose at the same time, and the market price rose by one and a half yuan. Tuesday was the last day of the July futures, but most of the floating longs and shorts had been squeezed flat, and it was also stable, with a relatively continuous rise of about half a yuan. On Wednesday, only the August futures were traded for one month, the market atmosphere was slack, and transactions were quite light, with the market price fluctuating slightly by seven or eight jiao. On Thursday, the September futures were added, and most of them were opened in sequence on the first day, with various gangs having slight needs, and the market price rebounded by six or seven jiao. On Friday, the July futures delivery was processed and the market was closed. On Saturday, due to slight selling by large accounts, the market gave back a few jiao. The overall trend of the week was between possible rises and falls, slightly higher than the previous week by several jiao to more than one yuan. Compared with the highest price on July 19, the difference was only about one yuan. If the current situation does not change, it should not be a revolving situation. The total transaction volume was 44,326,800 yuan, of which 26,800 yuan were spot transactions, and the total of futures salt tax and military occupation was 15,090,000, 5,190,000, the total of 19 customs duties was 5,450,000, the total of 20 coupon 20 customs duties was 7,260,000, the total of 96 positive six was 7,170,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially fell due to a lack of buyers and southern hedge selling, but later recovered slightly due to some short covering. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices saw mixed gains and losses, but only one or two points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by ten points, futures prices fell by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by ten points. The Bombay cotton market was lackluster and unremarkable. As a result, Pingal fell by two rupees, Ormra fell by two rupees and two and a half jiao, and Bairoke fell by one rupee and seven and a half jiao.

<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the total amount of tea directly exported and re-exported from Shanghai from January to June of this year was 237,837 dan, a decrease of 5% compared to the 247,787 dan in the first half of last year. In terms of the type of tea, black tea decreased by 16%. Black teas such as Qimen and Ningzhou from Lianghu saw decreases. The export of brick tea from Hankou also decreased by 16%. Only green tea increased by about 20%. In terms of country, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, India, and the most important export destination, Africa, all saw decreases. Only the United States and Russia saw slight increases, but the numbers were very limited. The following is a table of the number of teas exported and re-exported from Shanghai.</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 28th reported that the Shanghai cotton market plummeted due to the closing of long positions. The unlimited selling by speculators has been seen to have improved the actual position, and at the same time, the supply has also decreased. Reports of heavy rains damaging cotton in the southern and central cotton belts have revived excitement. Western Texas and Oklahoma still need to be cleared, while the eastern and central cotton belts have been infested by bollworms due to rain. The issue of reducing cotton acreage has apparently not developed. Industry participants are waiting for the government's report. The news that the rural sales agency will purchase futures to sell to farmers to offset their reduced cotton acreage is quite helpful to the market. However, most industry insiders believe that the transaction currently has a limited impact on the market, because buying forward is offset by selling spot.

<h3 id="e208">Talking about Dogs <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>—Lie Huo</p>
<p>Generally speaking, dogs are one of the most loyal animals; that is, loyal to the masters who raise them. At the same time, because loyalty has certain inevitable benefits, dogs are generally loved by people and kept as pets. However, the Chinese have never valued dogs very much. Therefore, although the national crisis is so serious, there are various national salvation movements, but none has appeared concerning dogs alone. Only the "dog racing" business is said to be very good.</p>
<p>Even the treatment of dogs is very meager. The only food for dogs in the countryside is people's excrement. Sometimes they can't even eat urine, because excrement is not as cheap in the countryside as it is in the city, but a unique fertilizer for farming. Therefore, if dogs want to eat, they can only steal, stealing by prying doors and climbing tanks. If they steal from their own masters, it doesn't matter much, but if they steal from other people, there is a risk of being beaten. As for feeding rice, feeding good food, and having a comfortable life, that is a blessing that Chinese dogs never have.</p>
<p>Growing up in the city is not much better, except that they generally don't want to eat excrement.</p>
<p>So Chinese national dogs are just dogs, or else it is strange.</p>
<p>If we talk about foreign dogs, then there is a lot to say. There are many names, such as police dogs, pugs, and Pekingese, and there are even special names for them. In short, there are all kinds. And the things they eat are even more exquisite. It is said that some dogs specialize in eating beef, while others prefer milk or buttered bread. Not only do they eat well, but they also have other preferential treatment, which is simply better than people. For example, foreign dogs don't like to walk, and want to ride in cars like people. When it's cold, they are also afraid of the cold, so they need to warm themselves by the stove and wear clothes. These things are annoying to people. Especially young foreign women who like to lead a male dog are not taken seriously by the Chinese. Therefore, Beijing once issued an order prohibiting women from learning from foreign women to lead male dogs on the street, saying that it was related to morals.</p>
<p>However, the loyalty of dogs does not have any boundaries. Chinese dogs and foreign dogs are all the same.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I read many articles about "righteous dogs." The word "righteous" is the ultimate loyalty. The fact is generally like this: "A certain person raised a dog, and one day took it to a certain place. On the way, they suddenly encountered a wild beast. The beast pounced on the person, and the dog protected him, so he was saved from danger." The author then used this to educate people and warn the world, always ending like this: "Alas, can a person be inferior to a dog!" or "Alas, even a beast is like this, how can a person be!" This kind of dog is a model of dog loyalty, and can simply be a teacher for people. From this, we can see that the Chinese value dogs because they value their loyalty so much. Later, when I taught elementary school, the first lesson in the Chinese textbook I used was: "Dog, big dog, little dog, big dog barks, little dog jumps, bark once, jump once, brother pretends to be a dog..." Dog brother and dog brother, going on and on with dogs. At that time, I was very strange. Teaching children with this kind of knowledge would inevitably make them learn to be a wagging dog. Later, I dropped out of teaching and came to Shanghai to study, and I gained a deeper understanding of the meaning of dog. Reading books and newspapers, I often saw the name "running dog," which meant that someone was enslaved and raised by someone, like a dog raised by someone. Once, there was a riot in the school, and the words on the wall newspaper were all "dog fights." This faction scolded that faction's people as so-and-so's running dogs, and that faction scolded this faction's people as whose righteous dogs. At this point, it was completely proven that in this world, there are indeed running dogs.</p>
<p>When I entered the door of society, the terms "running dog" and "comrade pug" were heard and seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Now it is truly a world of dogs. People who can "run" and can "dog" probably have some way to survive, otherwise it would be difficult to ensure that their stomachs don't panic.</p>
<p>However, there are also exceptions to the loyalty of dogs, such as "mad dogs" and "rabid dogs," which simply don't recognize their masters. There must also be this kind among "running dogs," but they are ultimately exceptions and a minority.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Congratulations 'Get Rich'! <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>Haha! Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies!</p>
<p>It's finally here! Haha, today is; 'July 31st'!</p>
<p>Haha! Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies!</p>
<p>The 'July 30th' calendar page has already been torn off, today, without a doubt, is 'July 31st'!</p>
<p>Haha! Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies! It's 'July 31st,' time to 'Get Rich'! Haha!</p>
<p>Haha!</p>
<p>Oh dear! Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies! I've laughed so many 'haha's,' my stomach truly hurts from laughing!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I report to you: the 'Get Rich Ticket' lottery drawing location is at the Yiyuan Racecourse, which is just a ten-step walk from my local temple to the dog racing track, Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I further report to you, the 'Get Rich Ticket' lottery drawing time is at one o'clock after lunch! I advise you to have lunch early, or even skip it, otherwise, the place will be 'packed like sardines,' and it will be difficult for you to squeeze in!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I further tell you, today is just the preview of 'Getting Rich'. The 'shining silver dollars' or the 'fragrant checks' will have to wait until the seventh of next month!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, so I have to ask you, have you read the Three Principles of the People? If not, let me tell you, there's an interesting story in the first lecture of the Three Principles of the People, which is about a porter who bought a 'Get Rich Ticket.' He placed the lottery ticket in the middle of his carrying pole.</p>
<p>Later, he actually won the jackpot. He was so amused that he didn't want the carrying pole anymore and threw it into the river. By doing so, he lost his chance to 'Get Rich.' So even if you 'win the lottery' today, please don't throw away the 'Get Rich Ticket,' otherwise, you will be like 'that person' in the Three Principles of the People and 'lose everything'!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I further tell you, when you go to Yiyuan today, please don't forget to bring 'Tiger Brand Ren Dan,' 'Bagua Dan,' 'Universal Oil'... ah, otherwise, in this hot weather, under this scorching 'sun,' among so many 'people,' and with this boiling 'blood-stirring' atmosphere, your 'precious body' may not be able to withstand it. If you 'can't withstand it,' even if you win the jackpot, wouldn't that be...?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I advise you, in case you stare blankly at Yiyuan for a while, without seeing your own 'Get Rich Ticket' number appear, (forgive me for saying something unlucky) please don't be discouraged, because it is said that this type of 'Get Rich Ticket' also has a 'second round' for 'persistent efforts.' So you can also 'make persistent efforts' to prepare 'at least' ten silver dollars, so that your first 'disappointment' will be replaced by another 'eager hope,' and your heart won't be 'grey'. (As for whether this rumor is true, it remains to be verified.)</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, if you really don't win the jackpot and at the same time don't want to 'make persistent efforts' and are truly extraordinarily 'disheartened,' then I advise you to read Lu Xun's 'The True Story of Ah Q,' which can relieve 'grey'ness. Ah Q often got beaten and scolded, and afterwards, he would mutter to himself: 'That kid is so rude, hitting even me!' You can also think like this: 'This... tricked me out of ten dollars again!' Then, you will be relieved.</p>
<p>Of course, haha, Gentlemen, Ladies, Young Masters, Young Ladies, I hope that each of you wins the jackpot. I hope that each of you goes to watch the drawing with a heart full of eager hope, each returns home with boiling blood, and in the future, each goes with tears of joy to 'receive gold' or 'collect checks.' Ha.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Ha, in short, congratulations 'Get Rich'!</p>
<p>Haha, Gentlemen, haha Ladies, haha Young Masters, haha Young Ladies, ha... ha... ha... ha! Oh dear, I don't know why I'm laughing again, ha... ha... ha... ha, my stomach hurts from laughing again!</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Under the seductive gaze of neon lights, a group of young people entered, and the waiters in white were already bending at the waist, full of smiles, to welcome them. After rushing into the small dining room, the electric fans whirred madly, and everyone kept shouting how hot it was. The waiters, understanding, brought up several bottles of soda, which were snatched up eagerly. At this time, the entire room was noisy and chaotic. The young people were not willing to let go of any opportunity to make a commotion, and a dinner party was certainly a good Chance.</p>
<p>Eight people sat around a table, and after the waiters brought up the vegetarian dishes, they did not hypocritically shout "Please." Eighteen chopsticks were already simultaneously mobilized, turning the entire fish and meat into their captives. Those who were a little slow to act were often ridiculed by those who had grabbed the biggest piece on their chopsticks, and the person next to them would definitely bump into their shoulder, causing their captured item to fall onto the table, providing another round of grabbing for everyone. Therefore, the organization of their dinner party, the building of relationships, and the discussion of knowledge, etc., were all external propaganda. In reality, they were simply seizing a Chance to make a ruckus.</p>
<p>The weather was so hot that going to sit in the office every day was truly a torture, but no one was absent from the dinner party. The older chairman had proposed stopping it once last time, but was opposed by more than six members. As for the chairman, he was only slightly older in age, not truly old, and he could certainly participate in the fun and commotion as much as possible.</p>
<p>There were only a few so-called main dishes left on the table, and everyone's stomach seemed to need a break. So, new tricks were introduced at this time, and ordering songs from the hall was a program that had to be carried out every time at the dinner party. After everyone knowingly agreed, the temporary secretary began to write straight away. He would not misremember who was ordering Linglong and who was ordering Yueying. After the waiters sent out the slips, the group temporarily dispersed, two in a group, three in a pile, discussing sound movies, women's stories, or even more obscene tricks. The dinner party was indeed a good gathering for young people.</p>
<p>A sound of high-heeled leather shoes came from the corridor, and the girls were all so beautiful and graceful. The small dining room was instantly filled with the vibrant air of youth. Each member of the dinner party hugged their good friend, lying on the sofa, leaning on the terrace, irregular jests, irregular actions, made the girls laugh as if they had been electrocuted; and this trembling laughter was precisely what the other party considered pleasure.</p>
<p>People had forgotten that this was the sweltering summer, as if they had fallen into the breath of spring's undulations. The girls' red lips, half-plump lines, were intoxicating the souls of eight young people in the thin cheongsams. Four large dishes were peeking at their ugly behavior in the center of the table, fortunate that they had not been captured. The older chairman had already paid the bill, and they were planning to go to another sleepless world. They swarmed out of the restaurant like a beehive. The cars on the road were filled with people enjoying the breeze, and the water and electric company's chartered cars were interweaving back and forth. Shanghai's sleepless night was beginning at this time; whether it was the sweltering summer, it was like an intoxicated spring.</p>
<p>A seven-story Western-style building loomed before them, with lights shining from every window. Cars and chartered cars were waiting at the entrance for their owners to complete a certain task. The eight young people were swallowed up by the spring in summer.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Big Casino in Shenzhen, Guangdong <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Feng</p>
<p>The Extravagant Gambling Life of Ordinary Wealthy People</p>
<p>The people of Guangdong love to gamble, from big cities to small towns, gambling dens are everywhere, filling the land, all those who have been to Guangdong know that. Amongst all this, the people of Guangdong do not know how much blood and sweat have been extracted from them by those gambling den owners and the local government. This is nothing more than a common phenomenon in Guangdong society. Next to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is a place called Shenzhen, that really is an unparalleled large gambling den. Inside this gambling den, there is a very high gambling platform, there is a stage, there are taverns, there are singers (i.e. singing girls), there are female waitresses, in short, all the things a wealthy person</p>
<p>needs to enjoy life are available. Originally, the customers of this casino were mostly rich merchants, politicians, soldiers, and landlords. They used this place as a place for entertainment, throwing away tens of thousands of gold pieces, which was considered nothing at all. From Hong Kong it only takes an hour by train to get to Shenzhen. I once followed a military officer to this place. Inside there were many gambling tables, what roulette big gamble, fan-tan, ti-zhi, really colorful, everything complete. The gamblers bet, at least one dollar, but the daily winnings and losses amounted to ten thousands. These gamblers, some were sixty or seventy years old, some were imposing middle-aged military officers, some were seventeen or eighteen year old youths, some were fat middle-aged wives, some were extremely fashionable girls, some spent all day and all night living there, when hungry the casino boss provided gourmet food, when tired they slept there, those who liked to smoke opium, had female waitresses to accompany them packing it, those who liked to have their bones rubbed, also had hired girls to rub them. So, they really lingered and forgot to return, not caring about wins or losses. What especially caught my attention were those wealthy people's wives and concubines, they gambled even more lavishly, betting millions at a time. I once saw a eighteen or nineteen year old young woman (I heard she was the sixth concubine of a certain important figure in Guangdong), her body was silkily glistening, her fingers were wearing three or four dazzling diamond rings, she brought twenty or thirty thousand dollars, and lost it all in one round, then pawned the ring on her finger for several thousand dollars to bet, she lost it again in a flash, but she remained calm, laughed it off. That kind of situation really made us ordinary poor boys want to avoid her by three houses. You think where do these politicians and wealthy people get so much money to spend on them, isn't it just by squeezing us small ordinary people as much as possible? Alas!</p>

<p>— Jack</p>
<p>When women's rights began to gain a considerable position in society! It is indeed from our Great Republic of China, therefore, no youthfully spirited young women did not try hard to struggle, preparing for | | to be able to reach a responsibility in society in the future; taking a step back, solving their own food problem. But in this year of all things not prosperous, to be able to stand on the battle line of 'struggle' to compete bravely | is worthy of our admiration; but unfortunately women passed through society! The difficulty is indeed more than men, not entirely because of their knowledge is childish, intention weak etc. and failed. According to two of my very good friends told me their 'grievances': I am even more twelve thousand points sympathize, decided no point do not believe them.</p>
<p>A told me her facts are like this:</p>
<p>'Ordinary men all scold us is vase, just is decoration good-looking, no production work ability, XX many impatience to listen to the words, that know desperately to get a bowl of food to eat eat; Post office | | in when a postal worker, just this | | branch post office just I a woman, the rest all are men. In this environment, do not do a sound, too lonely; but also can not all day do not open an mouth, so sometimes casually talk to them a few words, who know they on rise a strange heart, do not know thought to what place to go? Every day to and I nag what? In case be above of the people note: he on have 'character bad' of the title give you, if take angry do not and they talk, they on say is 'eyes high', 'set up frame' of the like of the words; however superior the people, have many matter and can not and he consult, lead, therefore they on take reason with say: 'Must is and he have what苟且' | | like this even an mouth and can not open, go past find right and wrong, turn come stand do not foot, right superior of the people difficult! Right at the same time do business of the people more difficult! ' ·····?</p>
<p>Q is a woman staff in a certain management section, she is engaged in copying work, she said;</p>

I though also see his command: but this is no way of of the matter, I openly as before to write 'due to illness apply for leave three days' of the slip, trust a woman colleague bring to. The command of the military agency is certainly more important than other administrative agencies! Unfortunately I, three days later still go to way; he | | section long, on find out I 'Why violate the order'? At the same time reply I 'Have what illness'? As office hall | | in have many people, I harshly of the question···· Finally promise he 'Belly ache'! He then scold: 'Belly ache all want to take three days of the leave'?</p>

Alas!</p>

<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao felt ashamed and trembled in his heart when he heard this sentence, and had to ask incidentally:</p>
<p>'How do you know?'</p>
<p>'The front line here also receives newspapers every day. This time, the public opinion is finally united. I see in the newspaper that the boycott of enemy goods this time is really being implemented!'</p>
<p>'If the public opinion in the rear is not united, how can we live up to the soldiers on the front line?' In fact, if Li Shiqiao didn't lie like this, how could he comfort Zhou Shaoping. He followed behind Shaoping, his eyes focused on the fine grass in front of his feet, his hands behind him twisting himself, this seemed to be a close-up in a movie, indicating that the owner of this twisting hand was buried in the troubles of deep thought. Shaoping walked in front, his steps very upright, but sometimes when he encountered stones on the road, he would kick the stone like a ball, flipping it over at least thirty meters. He suddenly turned his face and asked anxiously:</p>
<p>'How is Zhang Honglie? Because I can't go to see him on the front line!' He couldn't get any answer from Shiqiao for a while, and had to shake his head and said; 'It's a pity that he can't come to the front line. Anyone who has charged the enemy will never deny national consciousness again, but since he has been imprisoned 丨Imprisoned by his own compatriots, it only more factually proves the existence and strengthening of class consciousness, and divides the barriers of national consciousness. I feel that for anyone who has no national sentiment, we are going to ask him to go to the front line, and let the enemy's planes and artillery tell him everything.' Li Shiqiao was a person who always liked to theorize, so he was always keen on running publications and making plans. But after he heard Zhou Shaoping's words, he felt that if theory is the expression of words, then how empty and weak it is! Strong theory is brave action, and the action itself is the most powerful theory. Even if he had written more than 100,000 words of papers, had he ever said a sentence as precise as Zhou Shaoping's? He was moved by Shaoping and followed him to the edge of the trench without saying a word. The sentry on the trench asked them to jump into the trench to talk. As soon as Shiqiao jumped into the trench, he smelled a burst of earthy smell, mixed with the pungent smell of sweat. But when the soldiers in the trench suddenly saw Shiqiao in plain clothes, and Shaoping introduced him as representing the XXXXX Federation to comfort the soldiers on the front line, everyone smiled like they had seen their own relatives, some came forward to shake hands with him, and some came to inquire about the situation in the rear. The trench was suddenly filled with a gentle atmosphere. In the sky, soft white clouds floated over like a dream. How fascinating and admirable life is. So, those soldiers with families couldn't help but show a layer of nostalgic wrinkles on their foreheads.</p>
<p>But behind the white clouds, a few enemy planes with gray wings and red circles followed relentlessly, probably to search for the location of our main force.</p>
<p>Immediately, the forward sentries returned to report, the situation was: 'The enemy is about two or three thousand, with a large heavy artillery team, following the cover of the planes, rushing east along Yuexiu Road, the vanguard has reached the old site of the former Shanghai University.</p>
<p>'Go to hell!' Everyone in the trench tightened their armed belts.</p>
<p>The enemy plane circled in the sky and quickly retreated.</p>

<p>— Yin Xi</p>
<p>Even animals are protected by organizations. The fact that people are not as good as dogs is sighing. Animals added to the performance in the film have humanitarian organizations who think of protecting them, but actors, being human, are not cared for and protected. Although it is difficult to determine what is so-called cruel to these stars, there are many obvious inhumane things. Even if the stars themselves are willing to endure, I think someone should come forward and advocate for humanity, and should be prohibited or restricted!</p>
<p>It is said that in the movie "The Kid from Spain," there are several scenes of bullfighting performances. Every day when filming, various charitable organizations sent male and female representatives to supervise. They sat from morning to night, for fear that the precious cows transported from Mexico would suffer any abuse or damage. They almost always considered humanitarianism when there were scenes involving animals in the script, so that grace could reach animals. But what about the actors? They don't think about it!</p>
<p>But people should at least have some protection. Are they not even as good as a dog, a cat, or a cow? So it would be best if someone could come out in the future, imitating the method of protecting animals, and organize a "Film Actors Abuse Prevention Association." Probably this association is urgently needed in society.</p>
<p>One day, the Metro Company filmed a dog show in the summer. Because the weather was hot, artificial air conditioning was specially used, and large fans were used to fan the filming site. This way the dogs were very comfortable, because this is what the Animal Abuse Prevention Association advocated. But when Joan Crawford was acting, the weather was just as hot, but she did not enjoy air conditioning. Some people say that even if Joan Crawford suffers some heat, she won't be panting. If she wants to pant, the company will definitely prepare air conditioning for her. This is a joke, but at least it can prove that people's enjoyment is sometimes not as good as a dog!</p>
<p>One day a reporter went to interview a female star named Karen Morley. At that time, Karen Morley was filming three films at the same time, and was very busy. Karen Morley's body has been far inferior to before in recent years. This is probably due to excessive mental and physical labor. When the female reporter entered the room, a doctor held a large syringe in his hand and injected a stimulant into Karen Morley's skin. Karen Morley immediately fainted, like death. The female reporter was so scared that she quickly found a glass of cold water. But she didn't know whether to splash it on Karen Morley's face or pour it into her mouth. While she was hesitating, Karen Morley suddenly woke up, of course with a lot of pain and haggardness on her face, but she still had to stand up and work immediately.</p>
<p>Lang's sacrifice for art is known to everyone. Now his follower Boris Karloff's films such as The Mummy have a great impact on the spirit and body. His makeup takes two hours to complete and one hour to remove. The wax, rosin, paint, and other things used not only cut off his skin's breathing, but also tighten it. This is all harmful to his life. But Boris coveted the celebrity name and the salary of several thousand dollars a week; he disregarded everything. There are many other things like this. Shouldn't we try to think about it from a humanitarian point of view and prohibit or restrict it?</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In the realm of literature, although naturalism has given way to new realism, romanticism still refuses to relinquish its existence. Similarly, while film writers are expected to address reality to some extent in their scripts, their living environment shapes their thoughts and the content of their work. Thus, from different perspectives, they often inaccurately apply real-world themes. To expect them to embrace new realism is generally unlikely. More than that, they remain deeply intoxicated by the sweet dreams of romance and are unwilling to make their audiences frown with the ugliness or horror of reality. This is especially true for the increasingly unstable petit bourgeois class, who are more easily captivated by this dream. As a result, romantic works always garner considerable popularity. Therefore, the production of such films still serves a whitewashing function, which we cannot afford to overlook.</p>
<p>The above explanation is prompted by the content of "Bright Moon and Fragrant Quilt." It is undeniable that this film is pure romance.</p>
<p>Given this, the creators at MGM employed excellent equipment and talent to ensure that this romance would achieve its full potential. The result, of course, not only satisfies them but also pleases the petit bourgeois and the leisure class. That is their success. Clearly, in terms of performance techniques, there is nothing that they cannot boast about. Desert moonlit nights, seductive love songs, a beautiful woman bathing in fragrant water with flower petals scattered, a handsome young man lavishing attention on a beautiful woman, enduring even whipping—all for the sake of capturing a woman's heart, even to the point of heartlessly tormenting her. Playing cat and mouse to the extreme. This reminds us of "Carmen" and "The Soul of the Party." In short, this artist's ideal of love is expressed without reserve in beautiful images. As for the director's meticulousness, the set designer's and cinematographer's skill, and the location shooting, there is no need to point out individual characteristics, nor are there any flaws to criticize.</p>
<p>I believe many are familiar with the great star Ramon Novarro. Not long ago, he played Greta Garbo's lover in "Mata Hari," which we will not forget. He is also adept at portraying foreigners; now, besides Chinese people, he is posing as an Egyptian. His skills were already so exquisite, and he naturally succeeds here as well. However, the female lead, Myrna Loy, deserves even more attention. We saw her in "The Animal Kingdom" with Leslie Howard, where she did not seem particularly successful, but in this film, she has made great progress.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this film, we can see that MGM, with its vast capital, has reached the pinnacle of performance techniques in all aspects. However, the application of these skills to an empty and unappealing story is still regrettable.</p>

<p>This story is probably little known even to Rita Hayworth's fans. She had an ounce of perfume, a one-of-a-kind ounce in the world, the crystallization of a chemist's lifetime of effort. This perfume does not yet have a name, so it can only be called the Nameless Perfume. Where did this perfume come from? When Rita Hayworth and Edmund Lowe went to London last year, they met a Parisian perfume maker. This maker had spent many years creating a special perfume, but after all that time, he was only able to extract one ounce. He met Hayworth and gave her the perfume. The method of making the perfume was also destroyed, so Hayworth became the sole owner of this nameless perfume. Now, anyone who visits Hayworth's home can smell a faint fragrance. Hayworth treasures this ounce of perfume as if it were a precious jewel. She says that this extraordinary perfume, even if only a tiny drop is applied to any piece of clothing, will last forever. No matter how it is washed, even if the garment becomes silk brocade, the delicious scent will remain.</p>

<p>— Shen Xiling</p>
<p>I was excited to go to the Nanjing Grand Theater, as this was a work by the famous director (G.W. Pabst), and I had never seen his work before.</p>
<p>A. The Sorrow of the Artist</p>
<p>I recall the Japanese sociologist Hajime Kawakami expressing his sorrow in prison; the German scientist Albert Einstein leaving Germany to join the British nationality; and this change in the style of director G.W. Pabst... Who says that changes in social conditions and the vagaries of political trends do not affect artists, forcing them to submit? Naturally, if G.W. Pabst were a strong person, perhaps this would not have happened; if he is weaker, then only he knows his sorrow—the sorrow of the artist. I only knew him as a progressive director, but today I heard my friend Shusheng say, "He made this film under Hitler's influence and has now gone to France, where he is working on 'Don Quixote'..." The meaning is implicit, and the audience can understand his sorrow. As for whether he is still a progressive director, only his future works can prove it.</p>
<p>B. A Poem of Dreams; A Dream of Poetry; It is...</p>
<p>A French officer, in the hot desert night, recalls his love affair with a desert queen two years prior. Enticed by her seductive charm, he killed a friend and betrayed his comrades, and thus became a fugitive... A slow tempo; the beautiful female lead, like a Venus from Greek sculpture, fully portrays the allure of sexuality. The delicate musical scales will also intoxicate you. Truly a dreamlike poem, or a sweet poem of dreams. But also a cup of fragrant poison. It is enough to assist its master's mission.</p>
<p>C. Reference for Chinese Filmmakers: ...</p>
<p>There are two extremely important flashbacks in this play: the first is at the opening of the play, when the officer Saint-Avon recalls his love affair two years prior. Here, he (the director) does not use Fade-in Fade-out, nor does he use the re-shooting or Dissolve (as in "Spring Dream in the Boudoir"), which we often see in foreign films and consider the best technique. Instead, he uses Cut-in directly, but unlike a direct cut, the first shot of the flashback (several camels moving in the desert) uses a "slow motion" technique, as if imagined. The second flashback in the film is when Handmann recalls that the Queen was originally a singer... Here, he also uses Cut-in directly. However, the important thing is not the shooting technique but the sound effects, which the audience will surely notice. Other aspects, such as the position and angle of the shot changes, can also provide us with considerable reference.</p>
<p>D. Movie knowledge for audiences: ...</p>
<p>Foreign films are not easily welcomed by audiences in mainland China; Chinese films, in order to cater to mainland audiences, cannot use more sophisticated film techniques. These interactions hinder the progress of Chinese cinema. Just as one must learn fractions after learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in arithmetic, there are several places in this film where partial techniques are cleverly applied. For example, the final airplane shadow, footprints in the sand, etc., all save a lot of repetitive narration. Audiences in Shanghai will surely understand, but audiences in the mainland may not. I think it is necessary to bring up these ABCs of film.</p>

<p>Huang Daoheng, a native of Shaozhou, Guangdong, who previously worked at the Sanmin Film Company in this city and has been engaged in the film industry for more than ten years, has invented a method of showing movies in the light. In the past, movies had to be shown in dark theaters, which was detrimental to the health and safety of moviegoers. European and American countries had no method of improving this type of dark cinema. He devoted himself to research and invented a method of showing movies in the light. This method only requires maintaining a certain degree of darkness in the area of the screen, while allowing the audience seats to be exposed to light. There is no need for complete darkness, and windows can be opened for ventilation without affecting the light on the screen. He previously drafted a description and drew diagrams and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. After receiving the submission, the Ministry ordered him to bring all the equipment to the Ministry for testing, and the results were very satisfactory. It is now said that this method of showing movies in the light will be publicly demonstrated in Shanghai soon after the Ministry of Industry approves the registration. Dark cinema, which has been around for decades, will be able to open up to the light from now on.</p>

<p>— Gu Zhang</p>
<p>Starring Laurette Taylor, produced by MGM. Peg is a young girl from an Irish fishing family. One day, her father, Pant, comes home with Sir Chichester, an English nobleman, who tells her that her grandfather has recently passed away, leaving her a fortune of two million pounds! Peg, now transformed from poor to rich, stares at her father and Sir Chichester in turn, feeling as if she is dreaming. Sir Chichester is waiting to take her to England to inherit her fortune. She turns to look at her father, whose eyes are smiling strangely. Peg takes a long breath, hugs her white dog, and says to it excitedly, "We're rich! You're a rich dog now, too!" Her father also tells her that she doesn't need to catch fish anymore, that catching fish is not befitting of a wealthy young lady, and that she will now live in England.</p>
<p>Peg thinks with a mixture of surprise and joy: England? Her father once told her that English people's feet were almost like cow's feet, cloven-hoofed. England? Her father had said that it was of no use to him, and she didn't know if she would get used to it after she went. Her father told her that her mother was also English. This nobleman, Sir Chichester, is of course also English, Peg thinks, glancing at his feet, which are human feet and not cloven cow's feet. She looks at his face. He looks very honest, with a slight smile, and is also looking at her. She says, "Maybe there are a good person or two over there." Her father tells her to quickly prepare to leave. Peg rushes upstairs, gets halfway up the stairs, and then turns back and calls to her father, saying that she wants to put his clothes in the same box. Her father replies that she should not worry about him, as he is not going with her. When Peg hears that he is not going with her, she rushes back to him and says that she will not go either. Pant and Chichester exchange a look, and Pant tells his daughter that he is just not going with her now. In his heart, however, he is thinking that his daughter will be separated from him forever. She will be living with her aunt, Giggster, and her cousins, Alaric and Iser. He feels reluctant to part with his daughter, but thinking that he is just a poor fisherman, and that a fisherman's life is drifting and uncertain, he truly doesn't know what tomorrow may bring, and who will take care of her if he dies one day. Therefore, he decides to let his beloved daughter inherit the fortune. But he doesn't dare to tell her the truth.</p>
<p>Peg reluctantly puts on her best clothes in a hurry, preparing to leave with Chichester. Before leaving, she reminds her father that he must come, otherwise she will come back. After she runs up the stairs, Chichester says to the old man that he should not deceive his daughter. The old man says that this is the only way to get her to go, and after she leaves, he can have someone write her a letter telling her that he is dead, so she can give up thinking about home.
