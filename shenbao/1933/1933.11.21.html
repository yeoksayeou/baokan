<p>時評</p>
<h3>羅斯福政府之暗礁（一）</h3>
<p>— 有</p>
<p>自美蘇復交正式宣布而後。論者皆謂爲大有益於世界和平。誠不可謂非羅斯福外交政策之一大成功。然而自其内政方面言之。則暗礁尙多。據前日路透電訊。美國財長伍定。與副部長艾芝遜。均同時向美政府辭職。並已由羅斯福任命農業金融局局長摩根韜代理部長。摩氏則宣稱將堅决贊助羅斯福總統之國内外購金政策。以期抬高物價。夫摩氏向爲主張美金成分減半之人物。與早日穩定美金匯價之意見。自屬格不相入。雖據官方宣稱伍氏因體弱多病。無定期給假休養。而垣街謠諑蠭起。喧傳其他金融高級當局。亦將聯帶辭職。是足徴伍定之辭職。乃反映羅斯福政府統治下政治鬥爭之加亟。以此推測。美國通貨政策之前途。必將試行膨脹方法。殆又爲勢所必至者也。</p>
<p>夫羅斯福之繼胡佛登台。以有三千萬農民爲之護衛。在農民之心理。固無擇於胡羅二者之間。徒以不堪經濟恐慌之壓迫。遂興彼成善於此之思。蓋農民之所大欲。惟在於繁榮美國之農村。誠有如美國農村聯合會長雷諾氏所言。「今日之事斷非巧笑與詭變所能改變者。」</p>
<p>然而羅斯福自登台以後。迄今半載有餘。所倡導抬高物價之政策。成績果何如者。據美國農業經濟局本月一日報告。現時美國農民所購物品價格之上漲。實較農産物價之增加。尤爲迅速。是則數千萬農民。不惟未沾實惠。反有恐慌日亟之勢。雖曰爲時甚暫。效果未明。然依近事而觀。如五州州長之聯請規定農産價格。如數逾二百萬罷業農民之發動。如雷諾之公開指摘羅斯福背棄競選諾言。皆足爲羅斯福政府前途絕大之暗礁。</p>
<p>抑羅斯福政府之障害。非僅農潮而已。當經濟恐慌日亟以後。工人階級以工資日縮或貨幣購買力日小之故。恒易引起工潮之蔓延。故自羅斯福復興計劃開始以來。工人始終抱反對膨脹通貨之態度。羅斯福總統於此錯綜複雜矛盾重疊之局面下。旣認取抬高物價爲逃出恐慌之惟一途徑。復又須始終維護其執政時之諾言。伍定之去職。固足以表示通貨穩定派之不能取得信任。而摩氏以農業金融局要員入掌財部。尤足徴羅氏之决意以維護農民立場。爲恢復繁榮之道。然則美國通貨政策之前途。變化又將如何。果能有補於恐慌之挽救歟。又果能挽救農民之阨運歟。效力如何。議者滋疑焉。</p>

<h3>美俄復交重要意義約束日本大陸策　軍事合作無顯著徴象　緊急時有此發展可能　蘇俄首任駐美大使由前駐日大使充任</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　歐洲之外交參謀、皆堅信美俄恢復正常外交關係、在遠東發生之反響、將遠比歐洲爲鉅、以爲此舉即可見之最重要效果、將爲約束日本在亞洲大陸之擴張、但許多外交專家則所見更遠、認爲邇來有利於日本的亞洲均勢之擺動、或將最後爲美俄合作所停止、至於歐洲列强、則不問其遠東之利益若何、對於美俄復交、在政治上與商務上亦均極注意、</p>
<p>華盛頓與莫斯科之要人曾一再表示、渠輩以爲祇須兩國政府間之接觸能合於常規、即可使日人心中對於中國·滿洲·與西伯利亞政策之可能的結果、已覺飄搖不定、難於預測、設兩國邦交能在一九三一年恢復常狀、恐滿洲與上海之經過、行將有異於今日也、</p>
<p>雖美俄聯盟或軍事合作之說、目下尙無顯著徴象、但即使有將來緊急時向此方面發展之可能性、已足以阻緩日本在遠東之帝國主義、近兩年來日本政策之擴大、或者即因華盛頓與莫斯科間尙未發生關係所致、總之、不論揣測之正確與否美俄恢復政治關係、足以大減兩國民間對於日本戰爭之恐懼、可斷言也、</p>
<p>至於歐洲列强政府、則無一有衷心歡迎兩國之締交者、在表面上雖不作任何反對論調、心中實非所喜、或者僅法人、因德國國家社會黨之崛興、方欲與俄聯歡尙能以贊成之目光、觀彼蘇俄世界地位之增高也、</p>
<p>至英德政府、固非衷心所喜、即使其外部俱有慶祝之語、而熟悉兩國政府情緒與政策者、皆信兩國必不能認爲有利於自己、英内閣一部份將以發生有利於蘇俄之事態爲憾、其中保守黨陸軍大臣海珊最爲顯著、而印度事務大臣部内亦將重起傳統的排俄感情、蓋印度在維多利亞以前、英人對於俄人逐漸向中國·波斯·與阿富汗方面伸張勢力、即已嫉妒而疑忌矣、德之與俄、則以政治信仰之根本不同、邇來兩政府間糾紛日增、加以國家社會黨有向蘇俄烏克蘭東侵之心、益增俄人之疑忌、此外則恐美國將代德國而供給俄人以金屬品與機器、使德人日減之輸出貿易更見衰少、亦爲决定德國態度之一要素、凡此種種動機、皆足使歐洲官場不能熱烈歡迎美俄復交消息者也、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>羅馬　意大　利輿論均認美國政府之承認蘇俄、爲澄清時局鞏固和平、之一重要步驟、普通報紙均謂此重要事件之可能影響、並不限於遠東之時局、而國聯方面所受之影響亦必不淺也、拉伐羅法西斯達報稱、美俄兩國俱非國聯之會員、恐不久即將訂立不侵犯條約、而至終必將使日内瓦之勢力、益見其薄弱、且美俄兩國、自凱洛格條約成立以來、即有一種相互之關係、足以造成日後較比日内瓦更爲有效能之國際組織、再如以軍縮問題而論、美俄兩國所處地位不同、亦有另外處理之必要、將來或能召集一太平洋會議、使美俄出席、則其所得之效果、定將較日内瓦之完全空想爲有用云、其他意大利報紙之藉此機會攻訐國聯者、復有公言報、該報稱歐洲及全世界應、趁早解除日内瓦之畸形嬰胎云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　苟非明日四國代表會議能獲超出人力以外之結果、商得一致計劃、則軍縮主席漢德森將於星期二或星期三召集主幹委員會、提議將原定十二月四日重開之總委員會展緩至明年一月間、因料屆時當可藉外交談判澄清空氣也、惟總委員會若果决定展期、則信法國將企圖與德國開始直接談判、至今日之四代表會議、仍主能解决對德立場、美英法意四代表共在漢德森寓所茶話三小時、討論應否根據十月十四日英外相西門宣言作爲繼續會議基礎、抑將另覓新計劃、但未能决定、聞法代表彭古獨堅持十月十四日宣言中之原則作爲公約基礎、但英美兩代表則願修改、意代表則主張會議暫時觀望、預料明年在國聯秘書長愛文諾别墅行會議後、當可有所决定、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英法意美四國代表今日會議三小時、未有結果、軍縮會主席漢德森評述軍縮會之地位、申說在英國草約提出二讀以前、獲一較大的共同根據之必要、散會後、雖各國咸守緘默、但知此次會議未有何種决議、各大國對於蔣來應採之手續、立場各異、法外長彭古一面主張軍縮會繼續開會、一面贊成十月十四日所議定之麥唐納修正計劃、聞美國亦贊同繼續開會、但覺美國不爲十月十四日恊定所拘束、如能用其他方法獲取恊定、則美政府可不中止合作、至於意國則明白表示休會之主張、英國現覺十月十四日之恊定未能成就一種諒解、聞明日四强會議後、星期二日將開主幹部會議、衆信總委員會自十二月四日起休會至一月四日止　提議頗有實現氣象（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）各主要代表本日在漢德森寓所開會、歷三小時之久、一般人印象、以爲主席漢德森極欲軍縮會議繼續工作、至於其他各代表、不過將昨日談話時所述之意見、從新與以申述而已、英國代表極言該國政府所以尋覓新討論基礎、以拯救軍縮會議之理由、意大利代表則勸令延會、謂當德國出會之時、訂立軍縮公約、殊屬徒勞、美國代表團主席台維斯不在日内瓦其代理出席之代表（即駐瑞士公使威爾遜）亦不過將台維斯最近發表之宣言加以追述、謂從今以後、軍縮僅爲關係歐洲之問題、總報告員貝勒斯則默不發言、法國代表彭古以極堅决之態度宣言、法國政府堅持本年十月十四日根據英國建議而决定之原則、彭古謂法國讓步已至極度、無可再讓、法國代表之宣言、頗使在座各代表爲之震動、而英外相西門由此時起、已了然於英國雖提出新討論基礎、恐亦無益矣、在此種情形之下、軍縮會議之前途究將如何、據各方情形觀之、似軍縮會議或即延會、或按十月十四日西門陳述之基礎、繼續開會、由今晚起、即當加以考慮、大約意大到代表團將主張延會、並獲有英美兩國代表團之贊助、至原定十二月四日開會之軍縮會議總委員會、則將改至明年一月開會、法國代表則反對此種延會、渠以爲軍縮公約必須訂立、並有訂立之可能、法國代表對於延會、及漢德森辭職之責任、不願担負、以爲漢氏如不幸辭職、則其結果不堪設想軍縮會議主席團、大約將於星期二召集、俾其了然於各主要國之建議、於例外情形時、其會議將爲公開、本日在漢德森寓所會晤之前、彭古與貝勒斯曾作長談、兩人曾對時局作詳密之觀察、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>閩事醞釀漸趨事實</h3>
<p>孫氏首稱、李濟深刻已抵閩、陳友仁是否亦抵閩、余尙不知、其人民政府、據悉設於福州、通電已否發出、余亦無從知悉、惟余知閩地中央銀行、已爲没收、刻下閩事之醞釀、確已漸趨事實、</p>
<h3>歡迎胡等入京問題</h3>

<h3>國家多難不應分裂</h3>
<p>孫氏繼稱、在余個人觀察、李濟深·陳友仁·諸先生、及十九路軍陳眞如諸先生等、素爲中央所依畀、在黨國方面、亦具悠久之歷史、在理斷不至出此、縱或與中央政見不同、或與個人意見不合、亦當開誠相見、不應牽動政治、輕涉軍事、致使國家多難之秋、復呈四分五裂之象、益使内政無從整頓、外患無以應付、本人意見、在此時期、應團結一致、共謀對外、上下合力勵精圖治</p>

<h3>郭有守視察魯省敎育批評</h3>
<p>（濟南通信）山東敎育、經張宗昌破壞無餘、自北伐成功後、始着手整理、數年以來、頗有進步、敎育部特派郭有守來魯視察、敎廳派第二科長賴執中伴同歷赴魯南魯北魯東等處、經一月餘之詳畫視察、最後又到青島、今日（十八日）始返濟南、郭氏自留學歸來後、曾奉敎部派赴蘇俄丹麥等國考察、學識宏富、此次經長時間視察本省敎育、其觀感與批評、至爲重要、記者今日特往訪問一切、茲紀郭氏所談如次、</p>
<p>▲槪括批評　郭談、略謂、余奉部派來魯視察敎育已經過一月餘、所經過地方、計爲濟南市·泰安·曲阜·兗州·濟寗·齊河·平原·德縣·章邱·鄒平·長山·青州·濰縣·黄縣·烟台·青島·等處、視察學校、計有省立師範·中學·職業·地方敎育行政機關·縣立中學小學·師範講習所·職業補習學校·民衆敎育館·平民學校等、槪括言之、師範分區計劃甚好、關於省立師範、視察一師·一女師·二師·四師·四五鄕師等·省立中學、視察高中·一中·一女中·三中·七中·十二中·十中·八中、私立中學、視察有德州博衛·烟台益文·芝罘·濟寗中西·濰縣廣文·泰安萃英·育英、省立職業學校、視察一·二·三·職業學校等、以上師範·中學·職業·三種學校、敎廳均有預定計劃、各校之所在地、亦均可成中心、尙屬相當、各校長在可能範圍内、都甚努力、學生亦極勤儉、</p>
<p>▲師範敎育　省立第四鄕師、校長與敎職員、領導學生勞動、共同運送磚瓦建築、頗有新氣象、其民衆學校、短期小學等、均已辦起、如農塲中蓄養鷄·鴨·牛·並且養蜂、預備作民衆敎育館試騐區、對於改造鄕村、在本校已有試騐、（敎科本上有改造鄕村敎材、）所有學生與敎職員、在一個方向上努力、極希望其他鄕師均向鄕村去努力、關於縣立鄕師、以齊河爲最好、以極少之經費、住在文廟内、房子亦很破爛、整頓以後、已頗有辦法、師生均甚興奮、各縣縣立師範講習所、全都限於財力人力、未能充分發展、</p>
<p>▲職敎機械　所視察一、二、三、職業學校、染織爲共同課目、一職有機械是其特點、化學則各校均不甚完　、一職與三職可望發展、三校校長、對工業均有研究、各能在其範圍本身切實爲學生謀出路、使學生畢業後、均有謀生技能、不過限於經費、不能充分發展、是可惜耳、染織製革機械、希望能擴大、爲學生實習、至於職業補習敎育、則多有名無實、</p>
<p>▲中學敎育　省立各中學、對於學生升學預備努力、嚴格訓練、私立中學、博衛、對學生英文、國文、算術、均分組訓練、使有天才者、得以有長足之進步、程度稍差者、亦能達到最低限度課程標準、對勞作敎育頗有計畫、學生在校均能自己修理自行車、是其一斑、芝罘中學、校舍及設備、均有可觀、縣立中學、黄縣縣中、頗爲整齊、校長趙竹蓉、對於募欵擴充設備、頗爲努力、</p>
<p>▲義務敎育　所視察各縣義務敎育、以齊河辦法、最爲周詳、鄕村小學亦甚整齊、該縣有三分之二學童、均已得有求學機會、該縣第五科長齊鳳圖、繼續前科長王緒興之計畫辦理、對於指定學區、均甚妥善、大槪每距離二里、卽有小學一處、經費來源、係照地畝攤派、該縣本非富庶區域、而竟能達到現在成績、殊令人愉快、此等按畝攤欵辦法、雖甚好、因限於中央法令、未能援例令各縣仿效、殊爲遺憾也、平民學校、以泰安爲最多、全縣達六十餘校、至於短期義務敎育、推行尙未普遍、</p>

<h3>崇德一鳴驚人兩江勝來不易</h3>
<p>丨結果卅二比十九丨</p>
<p>今晚東南對曁南</p>
<p>崇德女籃球隊昨晚一鳴驚人、劇門兩江、下半時曾成十六比十六之平手、第三節終了、兩江僅以一分差先、比數爲二十比十九、但最後八分鐘間、崇德不支而敗、結果爲三十二比十九、崇德後衛嚴密、使對手無隙可乘、前鋒活潑非凡、投籃準確、人小力弱、雖敗猶榮、昨晚女籃球、原有兩場比賽、兩兩遲到一刻鐘、由裁判員宣布棄權、光華不戰而勝、</p>
<h3>遙佔上風</h3>
<p>開賽後、崇德卽予兩江以猛烈之抵抗、形勢非常緊張、何妙英韋佩塤幾次試射不中、相持三分鐘、兩江陳榮明陳雪芳互中、崇德由何妙英還敬一球、從此兩江鋒芒漸露、陳榮明大發雌威、連連投中、第一節兩江以十比二佔先、</p>
<h3>急起直追</h3>
<p>第二節起、形勢大爲緊張、崇德小姑娘不甘雌伏、抖擻精神、急起直追、兩江後衛、頓時防不勝防、成爲多事之秋、韋何兩小姐、有投必中、兩江前鋒、困於嚴守、難於活動、傳出之球、每爲對手接得、投籃機會不多、是節成八比六、崇德佔先、但總數兩江仍以十六比十佔先於上半時、</p>
<h3>比數平等</h3>
<p>下半時起、崇德氣熖益盛、兩江前鋒、幾無得球機會、崇德前鋒、左右逢源、得心應手、韋佩塤矮小結實、何妙英嬌小玲瓏、汪鳳羣接濟有方、三球連中、頓成十六比十六之二十手、崇德女將、不覺喜出望外、兩江見機大妙、卽調楊森進場、挽回局勢、兩球連中、成二十比十六、崇德再接再厲、加上三分、第三節崇德以十九比二十落後、</p>
<h3>一落千丈</h3>
<p>第四節起、兩江最後努力、又恢復全盛時代、崇德固心力已盡、欲圖最後掙扎、實心有餘而不足、從此紀餘停頓、無能爲力、兩江女將、趁風打刼、連得十二分、以三十二比十九得最後勝利、</p>

<h3>說圓和方</h3>
<p>— 安夫</p>
<p>大凡一個形狀，没有圭角的爲之圓。物的形體正直的稱爲方。圓是方的對過：方是圓的反面。這二個相對的形狀，連小孩子也　得。</p>
<p>圓和方原是同樣一個狀態的名詞；不是在他們的命運方面，竟也會有顯晦的互異；圓這東西；可以說不論古今，尤其是十足摩豋化的現代，要算是最好的象徴了。就一般普通人的性情講，稱做事可以通融的人爲圓通，和氣的人爲圓融。就佛敎方面講，稱靈敏開悟的爲圓妙，所以觀音菩薩也被稱爲圓通大士了。天的别名呌做圓靈或圓糖、地球也是圓的。美麗的女人呌圓圓。月圓又是代表圓滿團圓的象徴。以致於洋錢，角子，銅板，也都是圓的。眞的美人與金錢都是圓的，要名譽也得從圓處着想；世界上的芸芸衆生，舍此三者之外，更有何求？圓丨眞是世界上唯一的寳貝。</p>
<p>至於方這東西，就不對了；我們只要看方柄圓鑿」這句俗話，就可以明白了。方，其實是一個一切最不祥的形容詞，最使人惹厭，同時也最爲不合時宜。像方言的不能行之遠方。（非楊雄所撰的方言）方術的不豋大雅之堂。方正的人，被人駡爲屈死阿木林。方士的處誕荒謬。以及宋朝方回的不齒於人。明代方孝孺的被殺，夷十族。總之，方是不祥的東西就是了。</p>
<p>方，在現在實是最没用的東西。圓，才是爲人的必要工具。我不覺要爲圓呌一聲，祝你萬歲！</p>
<h3>中煤毒</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>虎列拉巳失去了江山，紅白痢也已跌下了寳座，秋風已吹得這麽兒的勁，唔，從此以後，「中煤毒」，該是每天社會新聞中絕妙的點綴了吧。</p>
<p>有錢人，蓋絲綿被，羊毛毯，烘熱水汀，電火爐，旣溫暖，又衛生。没錢人，穿着破棉襖，蓋着老被絮，他媽的，不到三更天，被裏冰冷地給凍醒過來了，這怎挨得到天明。好，這麽罷，明天把燒飯煑菜的煤球爐，移到牀面前！加足了煤球，暖烘烘的，這可有得舒服了。但是，這一舒服不打緊，明天却可就有「中毒已深，救治罔效」的危險。</p>
<p>從這「中煤毒」的一回子事，咱就聯帶着感觸到社會上有很多「中煤毒」的玩藝兒。</p>
<p>小時候念書，最怕的是認眞敎授的先生，更其是在小考大考時，絕對的不許夾帶，抄書。所以認眞的先生，往往會給風潮犧牲掉，而馬馬虎虎的先生，便得到有力的擁護。這種情形，便和睡在煤球爐邊，没甚分别。</p>
<p>合老婆吵了三回二次的嘴，他媽的，咱就到外面去玩女人，不見得除了老婆之外，就得不到慰藉。可是，唔，咱花了大錢，只得到伊一點兒小情小義。這還算是好的。弄得不巧，遇到仙人跳，沾上花柳病，身敗名裂，這才是「中毒已深，救治罔效」。</p>
<p>没錢花，借債。低利的没處借，借印子債。債借到手，花得舒舒服服，老子這也算舒了一口氣。可是一口氣還没舒得怎銷暢，債主倒已鐵青着臉上門來了。還本付利，束手無策，只得給債主一把胸口揪着，老大的巴掌送上來，一把眼淚，二把鼻涕，後悔着不該拿不穩主意，以致「中煤毒」。</p>
<p>大之於國，小之於身，圖暫時的逸樂，而忽視了可能遭遇的危險，是無可倖免於「中煤毒」的。這是一個立身處世的敎訓。</p>
<h3>針</h3>
<p>— 傅紅藝</p>
<p>不要悔恨昨天，不要希望明天，且來尊重今天。不要怨恨過去，不要計算將來，且抓住現在。</p>
<p>在現實的社會裏，要找出個心田純潔，行爲忠實者來做朋友，祗有向孩子隊裏跑。</p>
<p>「禁止小便」的招貼没有靈效，於是在「禁止小便」下加上「違者送警」，或「小便者五車」等字樣。但，結果，仍是這般。這裏我得學魯迅說：「懂得這些，就懂得中國人大半」</p>
<h3>睡覺的處罰</h3>
<p>— 謝基爵</p>
<p>若宰予之晝寢，固屬「朽木不可雕」，然而孔二先生究竟不過嘆宰予之不可造就，還没有取消他聞道的資格；不取消他聞道的資格，是欲其明其道，知其過，或許也能因其知其過之所在，痛改前非，成一個完人，未嘗是不可能的事呵。</p>
<p>最近某大學有甲生因「課堂中假寐」，而「記過一次」，同時該校附中也有一個學生在課上睡覺，學校當局「姑念其初犯」，所以别出心裁的給該生以「不准讀公民課」的處罰，並且布告俾衆周知。</p>
<p>近來一般學生上課太隨便，也是不可諱的事實。課上睡覺，的確不可不加以懲戒，記一次過在訓育原則上尙無不合，所謂懲一儆百的意思。但是不准其讀公民課，究竟這種處罰是否得當，尙須顧到。要知道公民學原是敎人以完美的人格的科學，是學校訓育的理論課程，學生讀公民俾得明悉做人的規律，了解通常的弊端與過失，從而革除之，走入完美的人生道上去。因爲學生在課堂中睡覺，便不准其讀公民課，換言之，即不准其有做公民的權利，這個睡覺的處罰，眞有待於敎育家的研討與批判！</p>
<h3>鬚的故事</h3>
<p>— 殘葉</p>
<p>在古代的東方民族，有一種很深的迷信；以爲一個男子的鬚髯，是榮耀的表示，而要懲罰人時，便是强迫他薙去鬚髯，幷將頭髮剪短。但看阿西利亞Ａssyria古代的雕刻，所刻的帝王之像，都是長長的鬚子，飄拂胸前，他們的頭髮，也總是長長的，而伺候在左右的奴隷，却連一根鬚子都没有，把臉兒刮得精光，頭髮也剃成和尙，彼此貴賤之分，當然一看就看出來了。</p>
<p>埃及人的意見，却又與阿西利亞各别：他們以爲鬚髮都是齷齪的東西，而且是人體上吸吮血流的蛀虫，非將頭部與臉部完全薙光不可，他們的奴僕也被迫照辦，不准留長。</p>
<p>古代的希臘人與羅馬人，因和仇人交手鬥爭時，往往鬚子被揪而敗，大大的吃虧，因此都將鬚髮截去，一毛不遺。據說亞力山大王Ａlexander　the　Ｇreat嚴令他的兵士們薙鬚，也就爲了這個緣故。</p>
<p>羅馬舊俗，男子們二十一歲，即須將鬚子薙下，貢獻於家中的神像之前。過了這年紀而再留鬚子時，那是遇到家人死亡的事了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>在海甸向東北的大道上，出徴的軍隊，是一步一步的走遠了，一大羣送行的人站在大路邊，都發了呆。江氏見桂枝手揑了長衣的襟角，默默的，在那裏緩緩地搓挪着。他雖是對了東北角站定，那眼睛可是望了最近的一塊地面，他自然是在想心事，然而是想着心裏好受呢？心裏不好受呢？這可不得而知了。江氏走近了一步，貼住他站定，口裏可就問道：姑娘，你怎麽了，回去罷，桂枝莫明其妙的，對他母親笑了一笑道：可不是，我們該回去了。我們還等着什麽呢？說畢，他就在前面走。於是趙翁黄曼英，都隨着他走進屋子來了。最妙的就是並不走回他的後院，也跟着走到楊家來。江氏在前面走着，嘆了一口氣道：以前我見了當大兵的，我心裏就恨，現在我見了當大兵的，我只是可憐他們。我覺得以前作的事，實在有些不對了。我要有兒子，才不……說到了這裏，桂枝一回頭，笑道：老太爺也來了。請坐罷。江氏笑道：你瞧，我眞是大意，老大爺來了，我也没有瞧見。姑娘，你去作一點兒開水。趙翁也是莫明其妙，自己怎麽着，就跟了親家母之後，走到這裏來了。旣是走進門來了，决没有不作一點交代又走了出去的，只得笑道：你别張羅，我瞧你心裏有些難受，還有這位黄小姐，也是有一種說不出來的苦在心裏，所以我來和大家談談解個悶兒。江氏笑道：喲！我們心裏難受的話，還能賽過老太爺去嗎？趙翁就坐下來笑道：凡事都是一個慣。我家自强，成人以後，就是老離開着我的。現時不在我面前，我倒不怎麽着惦記了。這樣大的兒子了，也不能抱在懷裏帶了大來呀。（二四五）</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>賭</h3>
<p>— 朱烟影</p>
<p>說定是八圈，又添四圈，十二圈麻將打完，快到半夜一點鐘了。</p>
<p>走出朋友家的大門，朔風迎面撲來，一陣冷從心頭兜起，雖則運有二位夥伴同行，也不能使我的思潮再留戀於歡樂裏了。</p>
<p>到家了，妹妹來開門，另外一種感覺跑進我的心之深處，不自覺地眼淚已潄潄地落下來。</p>
<p>媽媽是病着；妹妹雙眉緊蹙，顯出憂愁，我從早晨出來，到此刻才回轉。</p>
<p>「又在那裏賭牌嗎？」</p>
<p>我無勇氣問媽媽的精神如何，而媽媽却見我跨進門就這樣說。我知道，媽媽並不是對我抱怨，因爲媽媽眞太和善了，對於我，從不曾施過重責的話語，然而，我聽到了却好像受着一把利刄的戳刺！啊！自己且仔細想想，作錯了事没有？我便没有話回答了！</p>
<p>「當心自己的身體呢！」</p>
<p>近來我賭昏了，夜夜都得到十二時或一時才歸來，媽媽說當心身體，自己也可曾想到過嗎？</p>
<p>掌了燈到自己寢室裡。聽見隔壁的媽媽的苦痛的咳聲，悲哀佔據了我的全身心。</p>
<p>承族叔的愛護，代爲謀到這一個位置，每月的收入比以前在工廠裡要多五倍，於是對於全家的生活足夠維持了，不致再時常掉到窘迫的深淵中去。可是，我忽然嗜好起賭博來了，三天兩次地不回家晚餐，跟同事到同事家裏去玩輸贏。媽媽和妹妹坐在家裡等着，氣候已到嚴寒，伊們爲了我忍受凍冷，明天早晨還須要爲我辦公的關係没天亮就起身煮早飯。</p>
<p>這幾天媽媽正患着咳嗽，止咳藥水吃了無效，還似乎只見加重；我怎麽不將媽媽的病比自己的輸贏看得重要，竟仍然會賭到夜深呢？媽媽的病更或許是因我而起的。</p>
<p>贏了錢也有化完的一天，况我貧窮到如今，不至於恰恰缺少這贏到的幾個錢用。不關心到媽媽的病痛，圖逞自己的私慾，卽使今天到明天能夠從赤貧變爲巨富，我也將如何安慰年老的媽媽？</p>
<p>睡在床上，腦筋裏的思想，好像萬馬奔騰往回轉旋，我對自己忿恨到極點了！</p>
<p>年老的媽媽含辛茹苦，自爸爸十年前死去後，牙齒一個個脫落，白髮漸漸地加多，但伊一些也不覺得傷憂，只是帶着笑容操勞，殷勤地撫養伊的兒子！我。使媽媽的心可以歡欣的根由是什麽，我的胸中很了然，可是，我是否向媽媽所期望的目的走，讓媽媽更加歡欣呢？唉！事實正是相反，我卽使跪下來向媽媽痛哭懺悔，也無饒恕的餘地啊！</p>
<p>賭的結果，又每次必負，三元五元，家庭的生活費都在一副副骨牌不和之後被别人的狡謀捕獲了去。一方面竭力向媽媽和妹妹說要節儉，每個月應當省下若干錢貯着；媽媽和妹妹又眞能夠照着做，中飯我不在家吃，伊們祗燒稀飯，拿一根油條伴了嚥下肚，而我自己呢，天啊！竟在賭博裡毫無制節地把鈔票輸去！</p>
<p>我看見爸爸的含了苦笑的臉龐向着我，「兒啊，你怎麽變了呢」的意思羞得我失了知覺；媽媽的呻吟聲在響應爸爸的苦笑，唉！我的眼淚流乾了！我自己該努力地贖救罷？</p>

<h3>現實的認識（上）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>當我解釋「沙寗」的非眞實性的時候，我曾提及那是與作者的藝術力有關之點，其後不久我就看見了某先生對於我的這意見的指摘，按他的意思，人物的眞實是以其是否實存爲决定，而與藝術力無關的。在這種意見的衝突中，或者是表示了我們對於藝術的觀察的根本的差異，例如，譬喻地講，在製造人物的場合，他是把藝術的機能看成爲攝影機，不管攝影師的手法怎樣地高明，實存的人物總是必要的；反之，我看藝術是如畫家的筆，顔料以及畫布，在畫家的面前如果有一個模特兒，其對象雖是定形的，未必就能原樣複現在彩色的油布上，但如果畫家的腦裏生了一個意象，雖然面前並無實際的模特兒，他的人物的製造仍然可以是同樣地眞實的。總之把藝術看爲過於機械的東西，我是反對的。</p>
<p>使藝術實際上完成了藝術的任務，它之不能說離開現實，那確是一個原則。但因此不能就斷定藝術必定是現實的忠實的反映。因爲，作爲一個藝術家或文學家，他的創作的眞實性，並非是在其有無現實的問題，而是在其對於現實認識的程度和正確性，以及如何不破壞藝術的均整使他的認識具體地形成一種藝術品。所以藝術的現實，或是那被移到藝術裏來的現實，不只是作家對於現實的一般認識的表現了，那認識要是深刻的正確的，並且那認識的表現也要藝術地地正確的。更明白地講，藝術製作的過程，第一步是在現實的認識，第二步是在藝術的表現。我以前所謂的「藝術力」就是指這後者的。如果我曾　略了第一步的重要性，而只看重了第二步，那我應當承認我是錯誤了。但事實上我並未如此；我說「沙寗」在現實的認識的誤謬之上而又有着誇大的不正確的表現，的確的，我所以非難「沙寗」者，是因爲它在這兩點上，都有着缺欠。所以我雖没有否認第一步，而某先生却明顯地否認着第二步了，這不能不說是他的錯誤。</p>
<p>以屠格湼夫的「父與子」和阿志巴綏夫的「沙寗」，對比着給以考察，是最容易證實這理由的。由「父與子」出版的當時在俄羅斯社會上所引起的反響來看，我們不能不懷疑那主人公巴扎洛夫的眞實性。當時俄國父代的老人是無疑地憤恨着這種人形了，而子代的青年却也不歡迎他，聲言他們是受了誤謬的表現，老人和青年都毫不容赦地對「父與子」的作者咆哮起來，使他飲淚離開了祖國，但他仍固執地說：「這里是有着不折不扣的新時代的雛形。」其後，時間證實了屠格湼夫的主張並没有錯。「父與子」，以其對於現實認識的深邃，以其藝術的表現的正確，使這種「雛形」漸漸地成長着，俄羅斯的社會裡終歸出現了巴扎洛夫的類型的人，而巴扎洛夫的本身也就不愧爲一個典型的人物了。</p>
<h3>關於「誑」</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>據說現代青年，是需要說「誑」的。但也有些喜歡「平實」的青年，似乎又在歎氣。關於這，在我覺得祇有學一學「莊子」底口吻說：「誑之爲誑，其果誑也耶？實之爲實，其果實也耶？」</p>
<p>記得有這樣一個故事：某村，有父子倆。冬天，往山上砍柴去。工作一半，父親坐在石塊上吸烟。兒子突然心血來潮，想起了一個問題，便問：「爸爸，你想，這時候，做皇帝的，總是用金斧頭，在御山上砍柴了吧？」父親聽了，嗤之以鼻。接着，正經地說：「胡說，做皇帝的，那里要砍柴，這時候，還不是坐在御殿前，太陽下，棒住金烟斗吸烟。」</p>
<p>我覺得父親以吸烟的觀點，來嗤笑兒子底「皇帝用金斧頭砍柴」的理想，並指之爲胡說；這就是現在所謂「平實」的青年，說現代青年需要說誑的先例。但事實上，皇帝不免捧金烟斗吸烟，而决不至拿金斧頭砍柴。所以父親時代畢竟是勝利了。而平實的青年，似乎也可以站有前線上了。</p>
<p>然而我又記起了中國的老皇帝舜。史記五帝本紀：「舜畊歷山，歷山之人皆讓畔；漁雷澤，雷澤上人皆讓居；陶河濱，河濱器皆不苦窳；一年而所居成聚，二年成邑，三年成都。」然後堯在族長會議之下，（見尙書「咨四岳，朕在位七十載，」一節）讓位於舜。在舜做了皇帝之後，是不是還「拿金斧頭砍柴」那麽地去耕田提魚；史無明文，未可臆斷，但證之於「元首起哉，百工熙哉」之言，則所謂做了皇帝的舜，還是在參與生産勞働，而並不僅僅「坐在御殿前，太陽下，捧住金烟斗吸烟」以自適，却是事實。所以，在「做人」的那個名分上說，兒子底說「誑」，似乎還是可愛的。或許這誑還會變成「眞理」。</p>
<p>然而，也正因爲這「誑」恐成爲眞理，「平實」的青年，便不得不起來把說誑者駡倒，提倡所謂「吸烟哲學」了。而况舉世滔滔，人皆吸烟，香烟附着奬券，又有發財機會。若有人焉，復以「皇帝必須拿金斧頭砍柴」爲詞，其有不被善吸烟者或「推」或「踢」者，幾希。而讀「莊子」之流，如區區小子者，自然祇好搖頭而嘆曰：「實之爲實，其果實也耶？誑之爲誑，其果誑也耶？」</p>
<h3>北平印象記</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>Ｂoy來收過茶錢之後，車窗外已遠遠的浮起了這故都的風景線。在强烈的大陽光下，看去只是閃閃鑠鑠的一片，像夢一般縹緲，像霧一般迷茫丨並不如北平指南上說的那麽雄壯。</p>
<p>火車到了站，我在人堆裏擠到了月台。經過了一番翻箱倒篋的檢查，然後又在月台上擠出了車站。站外是一片廣塲，停着幾十輛洋車。臉上流着油汗的「苦力」，亂嘈嘈地爭向前來招徠從站門裏擠出來的人們。兩個紫膛臉黄制服的警察揚着籐鞭，在那裏「維持治安」，趕他們讓路給「接老爺太太們的汽車」。一輛，二輛，三輛……汽車從站口飛馳而去，括起了一陣慶主像濃霧一般籠住了站前的廣塲。剩下没有汽車的旅客，警察，「苦力」，在這塵霧中掙扎，擾攘。</p>
<p>我跳上了一輛洋車。在這人造的霧中，車夫把我拉出了廣塲。在我面前是巍巍的正陽門。在塵霧中望去，彷彿倒也很雄壯，單說這座城牆就有三丈多高，五六丈寛；但不知怎麽我只覺得牠没精打采的，好像破廟裏的金剛。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×　　×　×</p>
<p>北平給我的印象是什麽？我可也說不出。和我足跡所到的地方相比較，北平常使我聯想起南方的蘇州。在外表上看起來，北平和蘇州簡直没有一些相像處。從色彩方面觀察，北平是屬於濃艶的，蘇州是素淡。北平的屋瓦就有青，黄，藍，種種不同的顔色，門戶是很多朱漆的，女人們也愛穿大紅大綠的衣服；蘇州都是黑瓦和黑漆牆門，女人們喜歡素淡的裝束。從形體方面說，北平是闊大，蘇州是小巧。北平的街道不必說，便是幾條大胡同也比蘇州的大街寛闊·此外當然還有許多絕不相似的地方，但這都是物質上的不同罷了。</p>
<p>在精神上，北平和蘇州是屬於一個範疇的。最明顯不過的例子是言語。在南方，最好聽而最俏皮的是蘇州的「吳儂軟語」，在北方就是北平的「京話」。這兩種話在技巧上可說是「工力悉敵」，都能像荷珠一般滴溜溜的舌上打滾，而且仔細聽時是一樣的，都含有强烈的「陰性的吸引力」。南北交際社會的小姐們，不是都說愛兩聲京話或吳語的嗎？</p>
<p>不但言語相類，雰圍氣也没有差别。在北平或蘇州住家，都使你舒適得筋骨酥麻。在北平住上三年兩載，你便會玩古董，聽梅蘭芳，覺得此外並無他事可做。在蘇州你就會聽說書，吃西瓜子，覺得此外也無别事可做。等到你的京話或吳語說得流利時，你就懂得「屁塞」是什麽東西，或「唐伯虎點秋香」是怎麽一回事。此外，你只會在戲館裏狂喝一聲「門鑼采」，或在茶館裏滿吐一地瓜子壳。</p>
<p>簡單地說，北平就是一個擴大的古玩舖，蘇州也只是一個擴大的「稻香村」罷了。</p>
<p>我到北平還不滿二個月，此間的名勝古蹟還没有功夫去一一鑑賞。只就我所遊覽過的各處而論，也實在没有什麽新奇。大半早已在攝影或畫片上領略過，而且眞景雖比畫中的龐大得多，却没有畫中的美。但在故宮徘徊的時候，我心中似乎覺得有一種流水也似的情緒在那裏漾動，那是看攝影和畫片時所没有的。我睜着眼睛看丨丨</p>
<p>一個失去了生命的光榮，在那裏没落，没落</p>
<h3>華清池</h3>
<p>— 乾白</p>
<p>「春寒賜浴華清池，溫泉水滑洗凝脂，」這是多麽香艶溫柔的塲面！</p>
<p>這華清池，在陜西的臨潼縣，距離西安有四小時公共汽車的行程，荒凉的土堡，灰沙迷漫的路途，面目犂黑而饑瘦的人們，空氣是這樣的枯悶，從外廓的形態上看起來，誰也不能相信這兒會有「六宮粉黛無顔色」的絕代佳人，遺留下這樣的風流韻跡，然而歷史却又分明告訴我們有這樣的一個奇蹟！</p>
<p>爲了要保存古代的艶跡，最近有人將這華清池加以修建，在驪山下築有一個發水的總池，水溫平均在華氏一百零四度，又建有兩個發水分池，再從分池發水出去，分出東池西池大池跟貴妃池，在東池西池裏洗浴，是要收費的，所須要的代價，絕不是臨潼的一般人所能付給的，於是有大池供給那些出不起錢的人們以一個洗浴的機會；當然，假使不分出等級來，會有許多不方便的。還有貴妃池，據說是當年洗過凝脂般身體的楊玉環的地方，現在是供結女賓沐浴用的，普通臭男子當然不許進去，免得唐突貴妃的尊嚴。</p>
<p>我們是上午十點鐘的光景，到了這兒，不管那水裏是不是還有玉環的香澤遺留着，總歸是要洗一個澡的。浸在那水門汀跟白礬石所建築的池子裏，想到玉環當日在這兒洗浴的時候，這池子也許還没有現在這樣考究罷。</p>
<p>離開華清池後，大家都有一個同一的感想，就是跳進溫泉裏洗去全身的泥灰汚穢，一時確是狠覺清爽的，但等到離開了這兒，不多一會工夫，全身又依舊佈滿了泥灰汚穢，洗了等於不洗，若不想到這是一個歷史上有名的古跡，眞要大呼負負呢！</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>他舉目一看，靠近北方有一個深而輕的灰色的陰影，淹没了天·蓋住了海，正向他們跑來，好像從天上落下來的一團雲一樣。</p>
<p>他掉轉船頭，趁着順風，直向堤岸馳去，霧在背後追趕着，一會兒便趕上了，當它把珍珠號追着了時，它把牠重重包圍着，厚到什麽都看不見；一個冷戰通過筆爾的四肢，還有烟和霉混和的氣味，一種海霧的奇怪的氣味，使他閉了嘴免得嘗着這濕而冷的密雲。當小船回到了碼頭近處原來的位置時，整個的城市都已埋在這微細的水蒸氣裏面了，這種水蒸氣並没有落下來，可是却像雨一樣潤濕着一切，並且像一條流着的河一樣，在那些房子上和街道上溜行着。</p>
<p>手和脚都凍僵了的筆爾，連忙跑回家去，倒在床上，想在晚飯之前，小睡一下。當他醒來走到飯廳時，他的母親正和哲安說：</p>
<p>那個過道會裝得非常好看。我們可以擺一些花在那兒。你瞧罷。我會替你照顧並換動那些花。如果你有什麽宴會時，這將顯得異常華麗呢」。</p>
<p>「你們究竟在講甚麽呀？」醫生問。</p>
<p>「在講着我才給你弟弟租下的一所極好的房子。這眞是不容易尋到的，一所位置在二層樓的房子，有門通到兩條街上。有兩個客廳，一個嵌着玻璃的走廊，一間小小的圓形的飯廳，這房子給一個男孩子住眞漂亮極了。」</p>
<p>筆爾臉色變白了。一股怒氣窒塞了他的心。</p>
<p>「這房子在什麽地方？」他問。</p>
<p>「在佛郎梭一世大街。」</p>
<p>他再没有什麽疑問了，他坐了下來，被激怒得簡直想要呌說道：「這到底太勵害了！難道什麽都得歸他嗎！」</p>
<p>他的母親得意洋洋地繼續說：</p>
<p>「並且你想想看，我祗花去兩千八百佛郎的租費呢。這房子本來每年要租三千佛郎的，但我答應租下三年，六年或九年，所以每年便宜了兩百佛郎。你弟弟住在那裏面一定會非常稱意的。一個律師祇要屋裡漂亮就會發財的。因爲漂亮的房子可以吸收顧客，引誘他們，留住他們，使他們發生敬意，並使他們知道住着這樣房子的人說話自然是要很高的代價的。」</p>
<p>她沉默了一下，又說道：</p>
<p>「我們還得給你找一所和這相彷的房子，自然要比這個樸素得多，因爲你什麽都没有，可是也得相當可愛。我可以斷言一所合適的房子對於你是很有用處的。」</p>
<p>筆爾滿不在乎地回答道：</p>
<p>「啊！我，我是要靠着工作和學問才會成功的。」</p>
<p>他的母親固執地說：</p>
<p>「對啦，可是我可以斷言一所漂亮的房子對於你是很有用處的。」</p>
<p>用餐用到一半的時候，他突然問題：</p>
<p>「你們究竟怎樣和他認識的，和這瑪賴沙？」</p>

<h3>「幽默」與「滑稽」</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>私人倡「幽默」，公衆奬「滑稽」，這是在「國難當頭」中小百姓們一股烏氣的兩條出路，丨丨簡言之，是麻醉藥。</p>
<p>或說做人固不可哭喪着臉，而幽默的産生亦自有其作用，這話原也不錯；但莊嚴的事，一經幽默的外衣籠罩，便難看清事實的眞相，等到一流入滑稽者的手裏，那便只有一笑了之了。其誤事大率類此。</p>
<p>譬如「活捉東洋人」，這固然是一個痛快的題目：但一由丑角表演，這意義就與「活捉張三郎」無殊。同樣，「哭孫中山」，題目原極沉痛，但這是宜於直情地跑到中山陵上放聲大哭，或躱在家裏飲泣，倘由王旡能之流，用上「哭妙根篤爺」的調子，嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來，那麽聽衆會截取這一個「游藝技術」尾巴，而遺下所以「哭」的意義的。丨丨在觀衆或聽衆的目光中，孫中山先生也就變成了「妙根篤爺第二」了。這就不少無線電聽衆中，一調查究有幾個是爲着紀念孫中山而開的，就可知道。</p>
<p>故「幽默」爲奴隷的語言，「滑稽」只是盛世茶餘酒後的點綴品。倘想從幽默中找到出路，小調裏聽出「愛國思想」來，那麽，會像染缸中找白布一樣的使你失望。</p>
<p>但二者的眞實性究竟何在？曰在於減殺個人鬭爭的活力，與麻醉而已！</p>
<p>生活在現代的情况之下，憤懣是人人有的，需要娛樂也是人人有的，生活力的澎漲，迫得不得不向前衝，以爭取他所要獲得的事事物物。但衝的時候，不免要撞倒對方，或是碰傷自己，聰明人是會想到這些的。於是本想衝的，就不衝了，發爲幽默，悄悄的含着眼淚立在敵人遠處投一塊小石，希望幸而得中，而不被覺察丨丨因爲倘被覺察了，是連這點權利也會取消的，於是聰明人便更其聰明了。丨丨將要被衝的呢？就趕快起來奬勵滑稽，目的是想將贛聚的一股子怨氣，一針刺破了，希望大家打起哈哈來，而暫時的忘却了身上所負的痛苦。方法原是巧妙不過的，較之幽默是更進一層了。</p>
<p>至於所謂「發揚愛國思想」，「提倡民族精神」云云，說穿了不値一文錢，曰「烟幕彈」而已。</p>
<h3>二十號病房</h3>
<p>— 餘生</p>
<p>自然向人間展着微笑，溫暖的陽光照着大地，百花都伸出蘇甦的蓓蕾來，桑樹的葉兒也由小而大了，路上的行人都現着和靄而重入青春的英爽氣分，各公園的遊人來往如織，小鳥在枝頭跳躍並唧噪着，微風吹軟了一切閑散着的人們。這是人生最快樂的季節　春！</p>
<p>病院是××數一數工的太醫院，病人多半是富商和達官貴人。貧苦的也有，那是經過一切病院宣告絕望了才來的。住在頭二等的病人照例是不會有重病的，三等就不然了，有病入膏盲的，有貧苦無依的，尤其那黑暗角落裏，冷森森的二十號，一向只有經醫生宣告絕望，快要從人世間消失他自己的病人，才被抬進去。</p>
<p>老了，而且病着，是人生多麽可怇的遭際柯，都住在二十號病房的一個老年病人，據說有七十四歲了，親人是一個也没有。病了，因爲没鋪鈿的關係，就只能佔有這全醫院最髒的一角。</p>
<p>他躺在白色的床上，不斷的呻吟着，瘦小的臉上滿綴着飽受風霜的縐紋，從每一行深陷袖黑的縐紋中，鏤刻着他過去生命經歷史之無限的苦辛和創傷。滿頭的白髮根根向上直豎着，望去就能知道在他那粉碎的内心中，是像火一般地燃燒着塡滿胸臆的酸楚和憤鬱。在偶爾行動的時候，他的兩脚抖擻得非常利害，表現着那衰敗的肢腿，不但載不動他的軀殻；而且載不完他的愁苦。一向不見他有笑容，他的司笑的神經，似乎早已燬壞了，也從不曾見有人來探望過他，想來這可憐的老者，是已經給人類遺忘了啊。</p>
<p>他不經醫生的許可，常吃着極濃的黄酒，這種行動，顯然表示他是切盻着急速地完結宣殘餘的生命。有人這到他的身世的時候，他總是像狂人一般地怒目凝視向他的人，馬上就顯出一種無名的憤恨擠上了心頭，臉上的騶紋差不多都牽動了，嘴唇戰慄着，乾枯的眼中流出那血一般的熱淚。結果誰也不能有那樣的殘酷，再問下去啊！</p>
<p>當看護替他扭着衣扣時，他總像觸動了心事般地流着感激的淚，有時簡直是痛哭失聲了。他傷感着暮年無依的痛苦，衰老貧病的悲哀，在生活機能的朽敗和種種哀愁的襲擊之下，這老者的病况竟是一天不如一天的捱渡下去。</p>
<p>在一個黄昏的晚上，看護去量溫度的時候，發現他僵臥在床上，手脚已冰冷了，胸口似乎還有點熱氣，臉旁還掛着未乾的淚珠，襤褸的衣服都堆集在丨塊，一隻破碎的酒瓶被扔在地下。</p>
<p>他終於把自己燬滅了，大醉後像夢一般地死去了。人們把他抬進了「太平間」，「慈善家」施與他一口最後安息的棺木，襤褸的衣服仍舊陪着他到那不可知的渺茫世界去，但黄酒却不再相他作伴了。没有親朋們悼亡的煩亂，也没有兒女們的號哭聲音。溫暖的陽光照到他薄薄的棺木上面，他擺脫了人間一切的憂愁和苦痛而靜靜地，永遠地安息了。</p>
<h3>還鄕</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>二　九角六分</p>
<p>我等了×先生的喪事完了以後，就和哥哥及朋友李君去作山遊。我們爲了衣食，全年奔走外面，和山野的景色疏遠好久了，這次的機會我們自然不肯輕易放過的。</p>
<p>雖然天空飄着濛濛的細雨，我們對於訪問山林的興趣郤不曾减少了一些，早上我們嚼了許多熱噴噴的大餅，（多麽美味的大餅啊，也有好多年没上我的嘴了）就捲起褲脚撑了雨傘出東門走去。</p>
<p>二十幾里路的步行於我們並不覺得多少疲倦，潺潺雨點的飛濺也並不使我們感到些微的討厭，許是我們對於城市感了厭倦了吧，我們覺得鄕野眞有說不出的親切的意味。</p>
<p>雨中的野景，怡悅了我們幾分的神情，我不能說；我以爲與其說野景使我們的神情怡悅，還不如說使我們增加了幾分的感慨來得恰對。我們當時站在東門外的一個寺觀的第七層樓上，眺望着半弧形的天涯地角，我們各不自覺地沉在回憶之中了，無言的沉默竟維持了好幾個的鐘頭。</p>
<p>當我們喘着氣一格格地走下石級的時候，我們才知道時已過午，而肚皮也在開始需要進食了。於是趕急進城，任市街上找到了一爿菜館。</p>
<p>我打量着這菜館的裝璜，壁上懸掛着的儘是些西洋的名畫，都是裝了玻璃的方框，中國式的書畫屛察一些也没有了，我彷彿覺得我是在别處似的，因爲習慣止我總以爲家鄕的店舖中常是掛着本鄕的鄕先輩的屛聯的，然而，故鄕變</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>了啊，我的心情未免太守舊了。</p>
<p>在飢餓之中，我們不知狼吞虎嚥了多少的菜，故鄕的風味，使天涯遊子眞感到非常的適切，我們陶然醉了。</p>
<p>在開賬付錢的時候，我們發現了一小碗的炒蝦仁竟値到大洋九角六分之多，生疏的我們不禁瞠然了。後來，據店夥的解釋，才使我們明白：</p>
<p>原來在不久以前，有一個當上海某錢莊的夥計的回到家鄕來，偶然的呌菜館製了一碗炒蝦仁，不料那天怡巧碰到某大族辦喜酒，全城的蝦都給羅了去，菜館不能應命，於是那個錢莊夥計發了怒，决計要拿「番餅」來拚一下子，燒菜的終於辦到了一小碗的蝦，那錢莊夥計便覺有了面子，得意洋洋地賞他九角六分錢，從此吾鄕的炒蝦仁的價格就定爲九角六分了。</p>
<p>我覺得：那個「澤及鄕人」的某夥計是値得歌頌的，因此書之如右。</p>
<h3>「江湖術」</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>其中單表「賣技糊口」的「江湖術士」。他們是在街頭巷尾鳴金繫鼓中，打拳使棍玩弄些「把戲」以引　愚民婦孺的喝采來拿錢吃飯，這一種生活的技能，我們稱之爲「江湖術」。</p>
<p>「江湖術」之成爲生活技能，自然有共神深獨到的地方。比方他們擂　鑼鼓以圍集看客，鬧得聲勢越其浩天越其響亮，被引動的看客也必多。繼續就娓娓動聽的來一個開塲白，說他們南北二京五湖四海都曾走過，以見其大有淵源來歷不凡，隨着又吹怎麽會三十六層的「功夫」，七十二套的「變化」，以表示是如何有「偷天換日」「扭轉乾坤」的本事，「三敎九流」，非我莫屬。不消說口吐蓮花，談來頭頭是道，看客受了「宣傳」，才樂於「解囊」。這必須得兩人以至多人來「帮襯」，你吹我捧，一呼一應，總使你受其影響目迷五色而不自知的。序幕完了，才開始正戲，但是常常不是這樣容易，先得要錢丨究竟「把戲」是爲的要錢。錢到手了，或許是個全武裝的搏鬭，大刀闊斧，打得個你死我活分解不開，「戰事」頂緊張，「看客」得扔錢。事後不論誰勝誰負，兩方旣已「妥恊」，看客拿錢。隨着或者就是變化莫測的「幻術」，是文是武，均可爲醜爲惡，「青天白日」之下可以平空産生出許多龜蝎蛇蟲來，無論變好變歹，因其會變，「看客」拿錢。如果「看客」有些膩煩討厭了，得有刺激，突然小孩被殺頭，利刃入胸膛丨丨是一幕流血慘劇，這大大可以威嚇，「人人有父母，個個有弟兄，」正義所在，人道所關「有錢不扔拿錢不擲」，不許走路，錢完了，袋空了，么台。但是「把戲」未完，異時異地又可以扮演出來。</p>
<p>可是「各把戲各手法，各師傅各傳授，」這種「江湖術」的「把戲」有假的扮演，也有眞的扮演，鑼鼓聲中可以演，大砲炸彈聲中也可以演，街頭巷尾可以</p>
<h3>現代名人書畫</h3>
<p>香凝紅薇曼青大千四人合作</p>
<p>演，大而省與國的範圍也可以演，「把戲」大小不同，「看客」拿錢多少亦異而已。</p>
<p>這一種說來娓娓動聽，繼之以槍刀相搏，千變萬化，殺人流血來騙取「看客」拿錢的本事，確是中國「江湖術」的獨到處。牠之直到現在還哄得一般愚人婦孺拿錢而不怨，恐因牠「宣傳」有動人之處，搏鬭煞是好看，變化鬼神莫測，而且殺人流血也着實驚人，不然就會被人知道是一騙局而擯棄了。其實誰不知道是一騙局，知之而肯硬着頭皮上當，原因是在中國民族易於受騙，抑或是自有其奴隷的劣根性，這確乎是一件百思不得其解的事！</p>
<h3>從迷夢中醒來</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>雖然我是生長在上海的，但我是時常感到這大都市生活的乏味而咒咀它，因爲它有一種使人感疲乏和煩躁的雰圍向我有力地襲擊·因此我是做着要到農村去的迷夢，想起來做一個勞動而安閒快愉的農人！那時自己爬到樹上摘下了桑葉來喂蠶；親自拿了鋤頭耕種下苗除草施肥，餘下來的時候快樂地熟讀唐詩，以詩文爲友，以自己的勞力來解决自己的生計，這是最堪幸慰的一回事。並意外的驚慌</p>
<p>且那兒没有輪檝的紛擾，没有電炬的刺入眼睛了那兒又没有吹牛，没有拍馬；没有迷人的媚眼，没有險詐的心和臉……所看見的是青山，是綠水，是淙淙的泉聲，是吱吱的鳥語，是樸素，是忠實……啊！大自然底大塊的美境呀！</p>
<p>但是如此理想中的美滿境地中的人，都跑到這充滿了使人想覺瘦乏和煩躁的雰圍的都市裏來了，這該是使我驚異到萬分了！我問他們，他們說，他們春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏，披着星光荷鋤出去，戴着月亮纔帶了疲倦歸來，雨淋日炙，暑蒸寒侵的終歲勞動，無時休閒。農婦呢，管理家政，煑飯繼衣，還要背着嬰孩，送飯到田野去給男人吃，留着梅雨，採桑葉回來養蠶，從摘繭到抽絲織綢，從種棉到紡織布，其餘豢豬養鷄，都是農婦的事情，可是結果呢？吃盤中白米飯的不是種田人，徧身綺羅的，不是養蠶婦。不但如此，他們還說，他們自己種了田，仍然要飽不來肚子，假使再這樣下去，他們無疑的都將做了餓鬼了！我聽了他們的話，我不禁打了一個寒噤，我從迷夢中清醒了些，接着幾句關於描畫農夫與蠶締疾苦的詩飛上了我的記憶：</p>
<p>「二月賣新絲，五月縣新殺；醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉！耘苗日正午，汗滴未下土，誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦！昨日入城市，歸來淚滿中；距身羅綺者，不是養蠶人，九九八十一，窮漢受罰畢：纔得放脚眠，蚊虫獦蚤出！」</p>

<p>小說</p>
<p>[P童年斷片的回憶（十）&gt;</p>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>詳大到底是詳大，因爲他放了三年的牛，所以學會了百把首山歌，他常時與隔河的放牛的小孩子們鬥嘴，大塲他有九塲贏。然而他對我却格外表示好感，除了他在人家底後園裏偷到了菓子，一定要分送一些給我吃以外，他還常時照應我，敎我學山歌，有時我也分送給他一些糖果，那糖果全是從媽媽底壁櫉裏偷來的，當面媽媽是没有多少糖果給我吃，要吃糖，全靠偷，詳大吃了糖，他說簡直甜到心肝裏去了，從此他對我更好起來。</p>
<p>此後他便敎我泅水，他說首先做個樣兒給我看看，於是他便把兜褲脫下，一個觔斗打下水去，半個時辰還不見有力量，我一聽到這樣一句話，便把牛欄門開了，黄牛衝了出來，幾乎把我跌在它胯下。</p>
<p>還記得我那時雖然有了十歲，但没有普通的十歲的小孩那樣長，黄牛若把頭舉起，我恰只有它底下巴顎高，平時我比它底夙骳矮五寸，可是這黄牛却十分的慈善，它並不因我幼小而對我加以欺凌，它只是在籠頭底束縛下，跟了我底短步一步步踏，有時它現着憊乏的神采，嘶呌幾聲，若是它停住了脚，你便知道它定在便溺了，不然决不會如此的。</p>
<p>我已經把黄牛牽出了柴門，媽媽還趕上前來叮囑道：「你牽它往山坡山或田塍上去吃草便好了，可不要帶它往塘邊去！」自然，媽媽說這話底動機，並不在乎牛，而是深怕我去玩水，偶一失足，跌下塘去，是没活命回來的了，大前天賀瞎子給我算命的結果，說是命上有一個水關，在七月裏尤其要當心，媽媽聽他底話，比在觀音大士前許神愿還要信仰些，常說他是有問必答，說話可靠的大算命師，呌我不要玩意兒，七月裏尤其要當心。</p>
<p>爸爸媽媽不用說，就是最與我弄不來的大哥也非常稱許起我來了，他說：「讀書總不見你有些進益，放牛倒是你底擅長，怪瘦的黄牛，給你幾天銀得肥肥的了，將來請爸爸買一擔谷的糖給你吃！」這是大哥說慣了的大話，往常也曾說過幾次的，似乎記得。大哥底話不是很可靠的，我心裏明白，可是我也高興聽這一類的說話。</p>
<p>經過了旬日的時間，我結識山後的詳大，他也是放牛的，只是他放的牛，是人家的，不是自己家裏銀的，他底年紀比我大兩歲，一到暑天他便不披上衣，挺着胸脯，光着背皮，在炭炭的陽光下赤晒，到了七月末，一但暑天算是過去了大半，於是他底皮膚也便晒成了紅裏裹黑的辣醬色了，滴上水去，是不留上痕跡的，好像水銀一樣，一溜便不見了。</p>

<h3>爲着電影批評</h3>
<p>— 李馥</p>
<p>最近看到了幾篇論及電影批評的文章，有的對於最近電影批評的公式化和機械化卑俗化表示不滿，有的說明了目下最需要的是建設的批評。當然，這些文字的動機，都是爲着要改善電影批評，爲着要推進中國的電影文化，承繼在整個電影的轉變之後，這種見解和要求的提出，我以爲是有極正當的理由和根據的。</p>
<p>孫瑜曾說過，電影批評是一種專門學問，批評者必須充分的研究批評學，而後才能指出作品的正確與否，這樣才能樹立批評者的權威，同時，費穆也曾說過批評者太忽視了影片技巧的批判，所以對於製作者除出指示意識之外没有多大的帮助。我們承認這都是對於電影批評者的切要的忠告，對於影片的製作過程没有充分的智識，電影批評者是永遠會殘留在觀念的批評的圈子裏的。</p>
<p>是的，批評者需要知道電影的製作過程，需要知道世界各國的影業槪觀及其沿革，需要知道影片與觀衆之間的關係。換言之，在電影批評家面前，擺着一件很艱難困苦的工作。</p>
<p>無欵的，爲着要完成電影批評的文化上的使命，影評家應該勇敢地去担當這種工作，他們不該將趕看片子和趕寫文章當作唯一的職務，他們應該從書籍，從雜誌，從攝影場，乃至從電影院去知道更多的東西。</p>
<p>在這兒，爲着電影批評，批評者要對一切與電影有關的恊力者提出一些急迫的希望。</p>
<p>看了許多藝人們的談話，很可喜的知道了他們已經對批評家表示很友誼的態度，在此，我們更希望製作者和批評者有進一步的合作。批評者除出從書籍維誌之外，還需要很多的實際上的材料，因爲他們的研究，他們的探討，乃至他們的正確的，科學的批評，一定要有了這種實際資料的供給，方纔能夠完成。你看外國的影評家在批評一張片子的時候，他們不僅批評整個的作品，而且還要分析一切畫面的構圖，每個Ｃut的長短，以及對話，字幕的字數，………等之實質上的問題。我想，良心的電影藝術家假使眞誠的希望着中國電影的進步，當然不會吝惜這種有意義的合作的吧。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>「千里緣」評ＴheＭanＦromＴoronto</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>從前在很多批評文學裏，已經指出了英國片和美國片，在本質上並没有絕對不同的地方，他們的不同，只是在表現方法上的小小的差異。這一個論斷，我們現在看了「千里緣」，更得到了一個證據。</p>
<p>「千里緣」不外是男女糾紛，並且在這裏，連比較嚴重的事件，也没有。有的只是小小的趣劇，和小小的風波，他嘲笑着男子的見異思遷，他嘲笑着少女的情急，如此而已！</p>
<p>電影在歐美的現社會裏，除了供給紳士們的消遣，和替他們服務外，對於一切藝術家本身，差不多只有發揮手法的一種作用了。所以，他們絕對不問故事的意義如何，他們知道故事簡單，能夠儘量的指揮手法，他們就有意的採取這種「小風波」，「小趣劇」做題材，本來他們除了弄些小手法以外，也一無所能的了。</p>
<p>這張「千里緣」，導演者亦完全注重在趣味方面，（趣味兩字，在以前容易　人認做滑稽笑料，實際上不能採這狹義的理解。）他是一個塲面，又一個塲面，一個鏡頭又一個鏡頭的，把他所要表現的方面描寫出來，他一點也不怕麻煩的把小事情叙述。</p>
<p>但是，有一點我們承認「千里緣」的高明，就是無論什麽地方，導演者總能夠用盡各樣各式的旁襯，把小兒女的心理表現出來。這自然，因爲導演的生活里昂巴里摩亞平生最賣力的傑作「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙」將在南京開映。</p>
<p>環境决定，他是熟悉這種地方的故原。所以這張片子中，無論男女主角，都能夠細膩的表演出小兒女的「好弄手段」，好奇，好勝，内及他們薄弱的意志。這種地方藝術上的生活體騐的重要性，是明白的說明了。特别是我們的想攝製農工大衆影片的導演者，和想表演農工大衆姿態的演員們，更應該加意考慮的！</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「西方夜譚」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 愼工</p>
<p>在現代影界高呼着轉變聲中而有「西方夜譚」這樣的作品，實屬憾事！</p>
<p>意識的幼稚，在一道白光，一道黑氣中，顯露殆盡，而種種的荒誕不經眞不亞於西遊記，封神榜等一類的神怪。這非但與電影敎育化的宗旨大相違背，並且把腐化的思想，灌入一般人民的腦中去，使一般迷信的人更惑於神怪之說，我覺得這種作品眞是毫無攝製的價値。</p>
<p>演出方面，各種畸形的服裝，已令我人見齒冷，而攝片工作所誇口的那所偉大的酋長宮殿，簡直是道士們做道塲的一副器具，非但不能顯出是酋長的宮殿，且敗露了導演者的劣點。</p>
<p>至於幾張字募的惡劣，更使人厭惡，甚至於用兩隻手拍在字幕上，而在試片之後並不加以修改，更可見這部影片的馬虎了！</p>
<h3>「愛拉廷」之我見</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>誠然，「天方夜譚」是，部很有趣味的書，而其中的「神燈記」一段，尤能引起許多人的興趣。但是我以爲把這一段故事來攝做影片，無疑的是根本要失敗的。</p>
<p>就是丢開了意識不說，亦不少荒謬絕倫之處而爲導演者所忽視的。如愛拉廷死的一段，愛拉廷與一土人同在一處，愛拉廷死而土人没有死，誰也不會相信那火怎麽專燒愛拉廷，而不去燒土人呢？諸如此類的不妥當之處甚多，而在收尾，更現出了千篇一律的毛病，這種地方演出，遠不如原書上的描寫。</p>
<p>至於演員們在這種不適合時代的作品中，本來是無論如何，不會討好的。王春元太現出了怪物的態度，錢似鶯所飾的宮主，好像舊小說上所說的人物，衣服亦不知根據了什麽配合，有許多不中不西的。</p>
<p>總之，「愛拉廷」一片實在是白化費而吃力不討好的！</p>
<h3>卓别麟重整旗鼓</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>我們自從看過了却里卓别麟的一部「城市之光」以後好久没有看到他了，他好像是一個很厭倦於銀幕生活的人物。但是現在突然又有却里重新登塲的消息從好萊塢傳來了，</p>
<p>却里卓别麟確然是好萊塢的一個怪物，他自己開了卓别麟影片公司，自己編輯劇本，自己做導演，自己做主角當演員，自己製片，高興時隨時製造一二部影片，不高興時又關上大門休息。這一次他又休息了二年零十個月。</p>
<p>卓别麟在這二年多的休息期間，做些什麽事呢？他在這二年零十個月的長時期内，休息着不做事的没有幾天，他每天在他自己的家中寫作，他不知爲了什麽，竟幹起這窮書生的事情來，一般人對之都覺得很莫明其妙。</p>
<p>卓别麟二年多的一篇長作品現已寫完了，書名是「影界歷年環顧錄」，現在已由紐約一家大書商出版了。而卓别麟在他的工作告成之後略作短時期的休息，又要整理他的舊業了，卓别麟製片公司中攝影塲的大門又有開放的日期了。</p>
<p>卓别麟這一次演的仍舊是無聲影片，並且同「城市之光」一樣，仍舊是廢去對白而穿揷一二别種的聲音云。</p>

<p>龍納和他爭執道：「那不興，你現在是個有錢的人，而不是一個賣報的小孩子了！伊勒立道：「那我娶了她，她亦不見得還是一個擦地板的女傭呀！龍納，她太好了。無論你說什麽！我是打定主義娶她的了」。龍納問題：「琴意怎麽樣呢？」伊勒立道：「那是已經完的了。從前我爲什麽看上她，我亦不知道。爲什麽我要聽她的話，我亦不明白。她眞是一個在男人身上開金礦的女人。龍納，你的津貼，我今天早上，已經通知銀行照前支付了。」</p>
<p>龍納的津貼，他的叔父已經吩咐銀行照支了！那還不是羅羅功勞嗎？卽使他不愛她，他亦不至於忘懷於她呀。怎樣報答她呢？他應當使她快樂。龍納正在想着，羅羅開了房門出來了。伊勒立喊道：「我的小安琪兒來了！」羅羅微微地一笑，毫無氣力地搖着頭道：「你們二位，請到我房裡來，我有話和你們說……格麗哥萊先生，你是個忠厚長的，我很喜歡你，但是卽此爲止。要是我是那種肯嫁給你的女人的話，你想想，我還能比琴意好到那裡去呢？」他的頭低下去了，懊喪地深思着。羅羅拉着他的手道：「你眞是位好人。你爲什麽不找一位和你差不多年齡而眞心愛你的人呢？」伊勒立抬起頭來對她微笑着道：「或者你是對的，小寳貝。但是我還希望你是不對的。」龍納笑道：「她說的話是很有道理的。」</p>
<p>羅羅因爲龍納還是嬉皮笑臉的，所以回過頭來怒氣勃勃地對着他道：「你呢，你所需要的改造，比我所得到的還要十倍！我從前想一個窮苦女人，無妨爲金錢舒適嫁給一個男人。現在我知道那是不够的。一個男子，先是相貌好，亦是不够的。譬如你吧，你本來可以做個好人，但是你太自私，太無心肝了。你還是最懶惰。你爲什麽不做事，替你的叔叔伊勒立做些事？就是吉拉特都比你好得多。論到我自己的話，我感謝你兩個月以來，所給我的一切敎育。我現在對於男人的一切，都明白了。我亦不想再嫁什麽男人了。」</p>
<p>羅羅說完了，又低了頭理她的衣服。她聽見伊勒立走出去的聲音。她以爲龍納亦要走出去了。但是等了一回，龍納亦不走。他對羅羅說道：「羅羅，你說我應當做工的話是不差的。我現在請你收我做你的私人奴隷。你說好不好？」這似乎太好聽了。羅羅有些不信，她仍舊理着她的衣服。龍納又說道：「白天我在伊勒立的公事房裏做。晚上我回來替你做。羅羅還是不理他。他又說道：「羅羅，你爲什麽不用一個有用處的青年呢？要是你肯用我的話，之立即替你拿一切的衣服掛好！」得了，不要裝腔了，一忽兒羅羅莫名其妙的到了龍納的懷裡去了。（完）</p>

<h3>The Central Government Decides to Severely Punish the Fujian Province Incident, Cables All Provincial and Municipal Governments to Unite in Quelling the Rebellion, Yesterday's National Defense Conference Result Advocated First Adopting Persuasion Methods, That Evening the Central Political Council Decided to Order the National Government to Severely Handle the Fujian Rebellion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian attempted to rebel, the facts have been determined. The central government specially convened the 384th Central Political Council meeting at 8 PM on the 20th. Those in attendance were Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Gu Mengyu, Shi Ying, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Bijun, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Shi Qingyang, Shao Yuanchong, Ding Chaowu, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Chu Minyi, Gan Naiguang, Zhang Daofan, Wang Qi, Deng Fei Huang, Gu Zhenggang, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, Huang Musong, Chen Shuren, Zheng Zhannan, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Jishan, Zhou Qigang, Li Ciwen, Xie Zuomin, Deng Jiayan, and Miao Peicheng. Attending as observers were Wang Shijie and Li Yuanding. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting to discuss Chen and others' illegal actions in Fuzhou. When the central government initially received this information, it believed that during this period of serious national crisis and intense suppression of bandits, if those individuals possessed even a slight sense of national and ethnic consciousness, they would not have taken such reckless actions. Now that they have turned against the government in such a way, it is directly harming the nation, and the central government cannot tolerate it. It was resolved to send a letter to the National Government to severely handle the matter and to send a telegram to all provincial and municipal governments. The original text of the telegram stated: "Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the whole country has been striving for unity to save the nation from peril. Recently, the bandit suppression in Jiangxi has been achieving successive victories, and complete elimination is foreseeable. All construction can then begin, and the opportunity for revival is imminent. However, Chen Mingshu and others suddenly at this time, in Fuzhou, gathered so-called important members of the Third Party, established their own titles, and carried out a rebellion. At the same time, they colluded with the communist bandits, aiding their rampant actions, and fabricated rumors, falsely accusing the government, in order to confuse public opinion. If they are allowed to run rampant, they will poison the people and harm the nation, causing unimaginable disasters. Therefore, it is resolved that all military and political organs should promptly take action to quell the rebellion as soon as possible. All our comrades, at this time of sudden upheaval, should especially exert their abilities to jointly eliminate the crisis, so that the foundation is not shaken, and the great plan of saving the nation and ensuring survival can continue to be thoroughly implemented. This is our earnest hope." (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The changes in the Fujian situation are now undeniable. The central government initially believed there would be no problem, so it was very cautious in scrutinizing the records of various Chinese-language newspapers. It was not until the 20th that their attitude was revealed. The things they advocate provide many opportunities for criticism. The central authorities convened a National Defense Conference at 3 PM, attended by Lin Sen, Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Chen Yi, Zhu Jiahua, Xu Mo, Tang Youren, Tang Shengzhi, He Yaodong, Duan Xipeng, and over twenty others. The discussions were extremely detailed. Chairman Chiang also telegraphed his opinions. It is faintly heard that the result of the consultation was to decide to adopt a persuasive approach, leaving room for a turnaround. The first step is for the central government to come forward and reply with a telegram, which is currently being drafted and is expected to be released today or tomorrow. The intent of the telegram is to first describe the difficulties the central government has faced in dealing with the environment since the national crisis, then to narrate the current crisis of the communist disaster and the necessity of national survival, and finally to hope that the other party will have a change of heart. If they have opinions that would benefit the party and government, they can follow normal procedures and submit them to the central government for discussion, so that the precarious national lifeline can be saved. The meeting lasted for two hours before adjourning. At 8:30 PM, the central government held another temporary meeting. According to a certain important person, the authorities had received unofficial reports about the changes in the Fujian situation, but since the other party had not clearly expressed their intentions, there was no need to cause unnecessary disturbances. Now that the trend has been proven, they should still be held accountable based on righteousness, hoping to transform the harmful atmosphere into auspiciousness. The central government cherishes its compatriots and does not want to resort to military force. Internal and external troubles are pressing in, and the gentlemen in Fujian are all comrades of our party. How can they bear to fight each other, causing pain to those who are close and joy to the enemies? (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Receives Telegram from Fujian Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fujian Province is brewing a so-called People's Government and sent a telegram to Nanjing on the 20th. Because this telegram is of great importance, after the Telegraph Bureau received it, it only sent a copy to the Central Party Headquarters. After receiving the telegram, the Central Government specially convened an important meeting at 2 PM on the 20th to discuss measures, and the meeting did not end until 5 PM. Another meeting was held again at 8:30 PM, and the situation of the meeting and the original telegram from Fujian Province were telegraphed to Chairman Chiang. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Central Political Council Meeting Held in Advance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8 PM on the 20th, the Central Political Council held its 384th meeting ahead of schedule. Chairman Wang presided over the discussion of the illegal actions of Chen Mingshu and others in Fuzhou, and the meeting adjourned at 9:30 PM. According to news released by the Political Council, when the Central Government initially received this information, it believed that during this period of serious national crisis and intense bandit suppression, if those individuals possessed even a slight sense of national and ethnic consciousness, they would not have taken such reckless actions. Now that they have turned against the government in such a way, they are directly endangering the nation, and the Central Government cannot tolerate it. It is heard that they have decided to take severe action and plan to issue an important document to announce to the people of the country. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Wang Says It Can Be Resolved in a Short Time</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the illegal actions of Chen Mingshu and others, President Wang said to a Central News Agency reporter on the evening of the 20th: "The Central Government had already heard about Chen and others brewing a rebellion and reported it at the Central Political Council meeting last week. The Central Government colleagues all believe that if Chen and others are indeed engaged in acts of betraying the Party, or even colluding with the communist bandits, to the point of plunging the nation and state into a state of subversion, they should be severely punished. However, at that time, we still hoped that they would awaken, and the situation would not deteriorate. Based on the principle of tolerance and generosity, we made allowances for them. However, according to recent reliable reports from all parties, Chen and others' rebellious acts have been confirmed. At a time when the military operations to suppress the bandits are progressing and the international situation is urgent, Chen and others have actually taken this step of betraying the Party and the country, undermining the Central Government's great plan to save the nation and ensure its survival, and plunging the nation's survival into a state of eternal destruction. It is truly heartbreaking. But I dare to believe that this is only the reckless action of a few people, and the comrades in Fujian are deeply aware of the overall situation and mostly do not approve of it. The Central Government will be able to eliminate this anomaly within a short period of time." (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Reefs of the Roosevelt Government (I)</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Ever since the official announcement of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, commentators have said that it is greatly beneficial to world peace. It is truly undeniable that it is a major success of Roosevelt's foreign policy. However, from the perspective of its domestic affairs, there are still many reefs. According to a Reuters dispatch the day before yesterday, US Treasury Secretary Woodin and Deputy Secretary Acheson both resigned from the US government at the same time. Roosevelt has appointed Morganthau, the head of the Farm Credit Administration, as Acting Secretary. Morganthau declared that he would firmly support President Roosevelt's policy of buying gold at home and abroad to raise prices. Morganthau has always been a proponent of halving the gold content of the US dollar, which is incompatible with the idea of stabilizing the exchange rate of the US dollar as soon as possible. Although official statements claim that Woodin is suffering from poor health and needs to take an indefinite leave of absence, rumors are spreading like wildfire on Wall Street, claiming that other senior financial officials will also resign in solidarity. This is enough to show that Woodin's resignation reflects the intensification of political struggles under the Roosevelt government. From this, it can be inferred that the future of US monetary policy will inevitably be to try out expansionary methods.</p>
<p>Roosevelt succeeded Hoover, supported by 30 million farmers. In the minds of the farmers, there is no preference between Hoover and Roosevelt. They simply could not bear the pressure of the economic panic, and thus thought that the former was better than the latter. What the farmers wanted most was the prosperity of American agriculture. It is truly as Reno, the chairman of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said, "Today's affairs cannot be changed by smiles and tricks."</p>
<p>However, since Roosevelt took office, more than half a year has passed. What is the result of his policy of raising prices? According to the report of the US Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the first of this month, the price increase of goods purchased by American farmers is actually faster than the increase in agricultural product prices. Therefore, tens of millions of farmers not only have not received any real benefits, but also face the increasingly dire situation of panic. Although it is said that the time is very short and the effect is not yet clear, judging from recent events, such as the joint request of the governors of five states to stipulate agricultural product prices, the mobilization of more than two million striking farmers, and Reno's open accusation of Roosevelt of abandoning his campaign promises, all are huge reefs in the path of the Roosevelt government.</p>
<p>Moreover, the obstacles of the Roosevelt government are not just the farmers' tide. After the economic panic intensified, the working class was prone to labor unrest due to the shrinking wages or the diminishing purchasing power of money. Therefore, since the beginning of Roosevelt's recovery plan, workers have always held an attitude of opposing the expansion of currency. In this complex, contradictory, and overlapping situation, President Roosevelt has recognized that raising prices is the only way to escape the panic, and he must always uphold his promises during his administration. Woodin's departure is enough to show that the currency stabilization faction cannot gain trust, and Morganthau's entry into the Ministry of Finance as a key member of the Farm Credit Administration is enough to show Roosevelt's determination to maintain the farmers' position as a way to restore prosperity. Then, what will be the future of US monetary policy? Can it really help to save the panic? Can it really save the plight of the farmers? How effective will it be? Commentators are increasingly skeptical.</p>

They are now closely observing the development of the current situation and do not want to decide on the direction of their actions until they have accurate and detailed information. Politicians are unwilling to express their opinions on the Fujian affair, but when they meet with newspaper reporters, they say that Hu Hanmin will still stay in Hong Kong, the situation is chaotic, and the people of Guangzhou are now feeling apprehensive, anticipating that there may be incidents. It is heard that important figures related to the 19th Route Army have all left here. The recruitment office here has been closed. Chen Jitang is now focusing on consolidating the border defenses. The representative of Guizhou Chairman Wang Jialie stationed in Guangdong claims that although there is talk of Chen Mingshu taking the position of commander-in-chief of the five provinces of Fujian, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, Guizhou Province does not want to participate in the new movement in Fujian Province, and Guangdong Province also does not want to be involved.

<p>(Beiping) Zhuo Hongmou, secretary of Huang Shaoxiong, was injured in a car accident on his way back from visiting Prince Yun in Bailingmiao. He has now come to Ping to seek treatment at the German Hospital. According to the German doctor, Zhuo's lower back injury is more serious, but his life is not in danger and he needs to rest. Zhuo said that Huang and Zhao's trip to Mongolia to contact various princes went quite smoothly. There has been considerable progress on the autonomy issue. Huang and Zhao have now returned to Suiyuan and are expected to return to Ping in about ten days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, and Xu Tingyao and their party returned to Sui on the morning of the 19th from Beile Temple because the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue had been resolved. Prince De and others respectfully escorted them to the outskirts, 20 li to the Zhasake of Siziwang Banner. Prince Sha, representative of Prince Yun, and Kanren and others, representatives of Prince De, came with Huang and Zhao to participate in the Mongol-Han celebration. At 4 PM, Huang and others arrived in Sui. Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, Ba Wenzun and other important figures were waiting in the northern suburbs to greet them. The military police along the street were heavily armed and the crowds were dense. It was an unprecedented grand event in Sui. Huang, Zhao, and others entered the city and stayed at the Suiyuan Hotel. Huang said that after arriving at the temple, they conveyed the Central Government's intentions to the princes one by one, and discussed them several times. It was then decided to establish the first and second autonomous organization in Suiyuan and Chahar respectively, but this must be reviewed by the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan before a decision can be made. The issue of county governance will not change. After discussion, the principle of defense area issue is not to harm the interests of the Mongols. Personnel have been dispatched to various leagues and banners to investigate livestock farming. The Central Government plans to establish state-run ranches to work with private ranches to improve and increase national income, but revenue should still be collected by the Mongol banners. Tax revenue will be clearly divided. The autonomous organization government will be funded by the Central Government. Prince De and others have already issued a telegram expressing that they will not violate the Central Government's principles for handling Mongolian affairs. Zhao said that after arriving at the temple, he had three or four discussions with various princes to exchange views. Formal negotiations began on the 15th, but because the demands of Prince De and others differed from the Central Government's intentions, they were not accepted and they intended to return to Suiyuan. Later, with the mediation of the Panchen Lama, the situation improved on the evening of the 17th. Prince Yun and others exchanged views in writing. The first was to organize an autonomous committee, and the second was to establish a district autonomous government. They accepted the results as satisfactory because the second was more in line with the Central Government's intentions. Xu said that Mongolia has a vast territory and sparse population, which is extremely important for border defense. He had visited the near suburbs of Beile Temple and observed that the terrain was good. He also gave a speech to the Mongolian Huangpu Military Academy and the Central Political School students to encourage them. Now that he has been away from his defense post for a long time, he has decided to return to Beiping on the 20th. (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Content of the New Soviet-Xinjiang Agreement: Interview with a Certain Diplomat</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain diplomat said that the full text of the new Soviet-Xinjiang agreement has many places where the wording is not very clear, and it does not have the form of an ordinary international agreement. There are no meeting minutes to refer to. Many clauses contain the phrase "Xinjiang Provincial Government hopes how how." What legal interpretation should be given to this word "hope"? There are many questions. Article 3 stipulates that Soviet commercial organizations and people can go to various trading areas, and there is no limit to the number of personnel. As a result, the entire province's commerce will be manipulated, which is particularly worrying. Furthermore, Article 5 regarding the propagation of Communism and the application of precedents from other countries clearly violates the principle of mutual equality. Article 6 is tantamount to handing over the future of Xinjiang's national economy to the Soviet Union. If this continues, Xinjiang will become Sovietized in the future, and Xinjiang may no longer belong to China. Article 7 stipulates the procedures for Xinjiang's imports and exports to China to pass through the Soviet Union. In this way, the Soviet Union will invisibly gain the right to supervise Xinjiang's imports and exports. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tao Shangming Arrives in Ping to Report on Negotiations for Receiving Shanhaiguan; Public Security Bureau to Take Over First</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the matter of receiving Shanhaiguan, the Political Reorganization Council sent Tao Shangming and Liu Shisun to negotiate. Tao and others went to Tianjin earlier and met with Kikuchi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison. Kikuchi has agreed to have Wakakawa, the commander of the garrison in Shanhaiguan, assist. Tao arrived in Ping today from Tianjin to report to the Ping military and political authorities. Liu will go to Shanhaiguan on the evening of the 23rd, together with Lin Yu County Magistrate Yin Shousong, to negotiate with the Japanese staff officer Endo and Commander Wakakawa. After the negotiation is completed, they will immediately take over the Lin Yu Public Security Bureau. 140 policemen will be transferred from Haiyangzhen to maintain security in the city and the South Gate. The post office currently in Lin Yu city will also be negotiated to be withdrawn. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin at 12 PM on the 19th, waiting for Zhu Shiqin to go to Shanhaiguan together. He met with Japanese Army Staff Officer Endo regarding the formal takeover of Shanhaiguan and then the restoration of administrative power. County Magistrate Yin Shousong has already begun preparations. As for the postal and telecommunications services being controlled by the Japanese puppets, Peng Yiyi, dispatched by the Ministry of Communications, came north earlier to negotiate, but failed to recover them. Tao and Zhu have decided to continue to negotiate for their recovery. The War Zone Supervisory Commissioner's Office has already found a suitable address in Tangshan, but because Tao is busy with the takeover, the establishment of the Shanhaiguan Commissioner's Office has been postponed. The issue of through train service between Ping and Shenyang has not yet been properly negotiated with the Japanese on business and engineering matters, and it is difficult to resume service for the time being.

Therefore, there has been a surge in people visiting Lingyin Temple to worship Buddha and listen to the scriptures these days. (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Significant Implications of U.S.-Soviet Diplomatic Resumption: Restraining Japan's Continental Strategy; No Obvious Signs of Military Cooperation; Such Development Possible in Emergency; First Soviet Ambassador to U.S. to be Filled by Former Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) European diplomatic advisors all firmly believe that the repercussions of the resumption of normal diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East will be far greater than in Europe. They believe that the most important effect of this move will be to restrain Japan's expansion on the Asian continent. However, many diplomatic experts see even further, believing that the swing in the Asian balance of power, which has recently been favorable to Japan, may finally be stopped by U.S.-Soviet cooperation. As for the European powers, regardless of their interests in the Far East, they are all paying close attention to the resumption of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations in both political and commercial terms.</p>
<p>Key figures in Washington and Moscow have repeatedly stated that they believe that as long as contact between the two governments can be brought into conformity with common practice, the Japanese will already feel uncertain and difficult to predict about the possible consequences of their policies towards China, Manchuria, and Siberia. If diplomatic relations between the two countries had been restored to normal in 1931, the experiences of Manchuria and Shanghai might have been different from what they are today.</p>
<p>Although there are currently no obvious signs of a U.S.-Soviet alliance or military cooperation, even the possibility of developing in this direction in the event of a future emergency is enough to slow down Japan's imperialism in the Far East. The expansion of Japanese policy in the past two years may have been due to the fact that relations between Washington and Moscow have not yet occurred. In short, whether the speculation is correct or not, the resumption of political relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is sufficient to greatly reduce the fear of war with Japan between the two countries, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>As for the governments of the European powers, none of them wholeheartedly welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Although they do not make any opposing arguments on the surface, they are not happy in their hearts. Perhaps only the French, because of the rise of the German National Socialist Party, are trying to be friendly with Russia and can view the increase in the Soviet Union's world status with an approving eye.</p>
<p>The British and German governments are certainly not sincerely happy. Even if their outward expressions are celebratory, those familiar with the emotions and policies of the two governments all believe that the two countries must not consider it beneficial to themselves. A portion of the British cabinet will regret the occurrence of events favorable to the Soviet Union, most notably Conservative War Minister Hailsham, and the India Office will also revive traditional anti-Russian sentiments. Before Victoria, the British had long been jealous and suspicious of the Russians' gradual expansion of their influence towards China, Persia, and Afghanistan through India. As for Germany and Russia, their fundamental political beliefs are different. Recently, disputes between the two governments have increased, and the National Socialist Party's desire to invade Soviet Ukraine to the east has further increased Russian suspicion. In addition, there is concern that the United States will replace Germany in supplying the Russians with metal products and machinery, further reducing Germany's declining export trade, which is also a factor determining Germany's attitude. All of these motivations are sufficient to prevent European officialdom from warmly welcoming the news of the resumption of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>First Soviet Ambassador to U.S.; Happened to be in Tokyo During Japan's Invasion of China</h3>
<p>(Washington) A New York newspaper's Washington dispatch stated that the new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, was the Ambassador to Japan when Japan invaded Manchuria and China, so he is familiar with the situation in the Far East, which is hardly comparable to other Russians. His mission to the United States is actually related to this. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has proposed to the United States that former Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, be appointed as the first Ambassador to the United States. The U.S. State Department has replied that it fully agrees. It is reported that Mr. Troyanovsky will depart for the United States soon, and will take office around December. Observers here attach great importance to this appointment because Mr. Troyanovsky was previously stationed in Tokyo. (National Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, Litvinov in the White House and his wife, who remained in Moscow, made the first radio call between Washington and Moscow. The number of listeners to this initial call was no less than hundreds of thousands, and it was clearly audible. (TASS, 18th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) "What was prayed for in nineteen years has now become a reality in forty-eight hours." The above is an excerpt from today's editorial in the Soviet semi-official newspaper "Pravda" on the restoration of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations. The report further stated that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union occurred precisely on the day when the Disarmament Conference showed signs of collapse, the clouds of war in the Far East were densely layered, and the arms race in the West was becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the victory of Soviet policy is all the more evident in its function. (National Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian public opinion believes that the U.S. government's recognition of the Soviet Union is an important step towards clarifying the situation and consolidating peace. Ordinary newspapers all say that the possible impact of this important event is not limited to the situation in the Far East, and the impact on the League of Nations will also be significant. The Fascist newspaper "Lavoro Fascista" stated that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are not members of the League of Nations, and it is feared that they will soon conclude a non-aggression treaty, which will ultimately make the power of Geneva even weaker. Moreover, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have had a kind of mutual relationship since the establishment of the Kellogg Pact, which is sufficient to create a more effective international organization than Geneva in the future. Furthermore, in terms of the issue of disarmament, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are in different positions, and it is necessary to handle it separately. In the future, it may be possible to convene a Pacific conference with the U.S. and the Soviet Union in attendance, and the results obtained will definitely be more useful than the completely impractical Geneva. Other Italian newspapers that took this opportunity to attack the League of Nations included "Il Popolo d'Italia," which claimed that Europe and the world should abolish the malformed infant of Geneva as soon as possible.

<h3>Japan Studies Establishing a Governor-General System for Puppet Organizations; Major Restructuring of South Manchuria Railway Company</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the Foreign Ministry's plan to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway Company and the issue of unifying the powers of the Kwantung Army and the Kwantung Leased Territory in Manchuria have gradually become more serious, Counselor Tani of the Embassy in Manchuria was urgently summoned to Tokyo to hear his report. After the report, it was decided to adopt the following attitude: (1) For the sake of the development of "Manchukuo," it is necessary to reform the administrative structure in Manchuria. However, the Kwantung Commander concurrently serving as Ambassador and the Kwantung Governor is a transitional measure. (2) Therefore, the current concurrent system must be changed to a completely appropriate system. (3) The establishment of a governor-general system or other systems needs to be studied, but the Foreign Ministry absolutely opposes the mixing of military and administrative affairs. (4) After the above-mentioned system is reformed, the plan to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway Company should be considered. The Foreign Ministry can implement a partial revision of the South Manchuria Railway Company's operations in order to control the industry of "Manchukuo," but this is not a matter for the Foreign Ministry to manage.

<h3>British Parliament to Discuss Imposing Heavy Tariffs on Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(London) The British Parliament's next session will be opened by the Emperor tomorrow. The most important task of Parliament will be the Unemployment Relief Act. The main point is that local relief undertakings will be handled by a central committee, so many inequalities can be avoided, but the costs will far exceed the expectations of officials. The Gambling Act will be submitted for consideration after Christmas. It is expected that measures will be taken to limit the number of dog races. Lancashire MPs will make every effort to impose heavy tariffs on Japanese goods. At the same time, the House of Lords Reform Act will also attract attention. The decision of the Samuel faction of the Liberal Party to join the opposition party will not greatly damage the government's strength. However, the government's national finances will be weakened as a result. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>Britain, France, America, and Italy Disagree on Germany; Disarmament Almost Adjourned Until Next Year; France Insists on Original Agreement; Italy Proposes Adjournment; Britain and America Hope to Find New Plan; Soviet Russia Does Not Agree to Change Venue</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, a meeting will be held at the residence of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, which may determine the future of the Disarmament Conference. A final decision will be made at the main committee meeting tomorrow. It is believed that there is no other way than to adjourn the meeting, so that those engaged in diplomatic talks have the opportunity to find a way to resolve this current difficulty. It is now said that representatives of the powers will meet with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson in San Remo or another Italian city in early December to discuss it. Russian representative Dovgalevsky met with Henderson this morning and was heard to explain that the Russian government is prepared to continue to cooperate on disarmament work, especially the continuation of the Disarmament Conference, but the Soviet Union opposes moving the meeting elsewhere. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Unless the four-power representative meeting tomorrow can achieve results beyond human power and reach a unified plan, Disarmament Chairman Henderson will convene the main committee on Tuesday or Wednesday to propose that the General Committee, originally scheduled to reopen on December 4, be postponed until January next year, because it is expected that the atmosphere can be clarified through diplomatic negotiations at that time. However, if the General Committee does decide to postpone the meeting, it is believed that France will attempt to begin direct negotiations with Germany. At today's four-representative meeting, they still wanted to resolve their position on Germany. The four representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy had tea and talked for three hours at Henderson's residence, discussing whether to use the declaration of British Foreign Secretary Simon on October 14 as the basis for continuing the meeting, or to find a new plan. However, no decision was made. It is heard that French representative Paul-Boncour insisted on the principles of the October 14 declaration as the basis for the convention, but the British and American representatives were willing to revise it, while the Italian representative advocated that the meeting wait and see for the time being, and it is expected that something can be decided after the meeting at League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol's villa next year. (National Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States met for three hours today without results. Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson commented on the status of the Disarmament Conference, stating the need to obtain a greater common ground before the British draft convention is submitted for second reading. After the meeting adjourned, although the countries remained silent, it is known that this meeting did not reach any resolution. The major powers have different positions on the procedures to be adopted in the future. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour advocated continuing the Disarmament Conference on the one hand, and supported the MacDonald revised plan agreed upon on October 14 on the other. It is heard that the United States also agrees to continue the meeting, but feels that the United States is not bound by the October 14 agreement. If an agreement can be obtained by other methods, the U.S. government will not cease cooperation. As for Italy, it clearly expressed its proposal for adjournment. Britain now feels that the agreement of October 14 has failed to achieve an understanding. It is heard that after tomorrow's four-power meeting, the main committee meeting will be held on Tuesday. It is believed that the General Committee will adjourn from December 4 to January 4. The proposal is likely to be realized. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The main representatives met at Henderson's residence today for three hours. The general impression is that Chairman Henderson is very eager for the Disarmament Conference to continue its work. As for the other representatives, they merely reiterated the opinions they had expressed during yesterday's talks. The British representative argued vehemently the reasons why the government was seeking a new basis for discussion in order to save the Disarmament Conference. The Italian representative advised postponement, saying that concluding a disarmament convention at a time when Germany had withdrawn from the meeting would be in vain. U.S. delegation chairman Davis was not in Geneva, and his representative (namely the minister to Switzerland Wilson) merely reiterated Davis's recent declaration, saying that from now on, disarmament is only a matter concerning Europe. General Rapporteur Bellus remained silent. French representative Paul-Boncour declared in a very firm tone that the French government insisted on the principles decided on October 14 based on British suggestions. Paul-Boncour said that France had made concessions to the extreme and could not concede any further. The French representative's declaration shocked the representatives present, and British Foreign Secretary Simon has realized from this point on that it would be futile for Britain to propose a new basis for discussion. In this situation, what will the future of the Disarmament Conference be? Judging from the situation on all sides, it seems that the Disarmament Conference may either be postponed or continue on the basis of the Simon presentation of October 14. This will be considered starting tonight. It is estimated that the Italian delegation will advocate postponement and will obtain the support of the British and American delegations. The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, originally scheduled to meet on December 4, will be changed to meet in January next year. The French representative opposes this postponement, saying that a disarmament convention must be concluded and that it is possible to conclude one. The French representative does not want to bear the responsibility for the postponement of the meeting and Henderson's resignation, believing that the consequences would be unimaginable if Mr. Henderson were to resign. The Disarmament Conference presidium will probably convene on Tuesday to make it clear to them the proposals of the major countries. In exceptional cases, the meeting will be open. Before the meeting at Henderson's residence today, Paul-Boncour and Bellus had a long talk, and the two had a detailed observation of the situation. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) German newspapers reported news from Geneva that British Foreign Secretary Simon's deputy Eden intends to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome because the Disarmament Conference is completely hopeless, in order to find a way to break the deadlock. Public opinion believes that this is only a method of convening a meeting of the signatories of the Four-Power Pact. (National Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Romanian Political Tide; France States It Did Not Interfere</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romanian Capital: Since the resignation of the Vanda Cabinet and the succession of Liberal Party leader Duca as Prime Minister, newspapers of the extreme nationalist faction have subtly implied that the development of the Romanian political situation has a lot to do with the potential influence of the French government. Foreign Minister Titulescu today met with French Minister Tommaso on this propaganda. After the meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communique stating that the French Minister stated that the French government never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and that it has nothing to do with the recent Romanian cabinet tide. Foreign Minister Titulescu said that what Tommaso said is true, and that the French government has no partiality towards Romanian political parties. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Spain's General Election: Right-Wing Parties Achieve Complete Victory; Women Exercise Suffrage for the First Time; Scattered Riots and Strikes Occur</h3>
<p>Madrid – A special edition of the newspaper was issued today, announcing that the right-wing parties have achieved a complete victory in the election. Rumors circulate that the Socialist Party is preparing a large demonstration. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Initial reports from the Spanish general election indicate that right-wing parties hold a dominant position, having secured 150 seats. The Socialist Party has only obtained 110 seats thus far, seemingly losing 60 seats. Leaders of the right-wing parties anticipate securing approximately 200 seats in the parliament. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid – In this election, 70 candidates from 44 parties are vying for the 470 seats in the parliament. Currently, each party claims victory. What is known is that the right-wing parties hold a slight advantage over the Socialist Party. The failure of the Radical Party foreshadows the downfall of the Barrios government. A second round of voting is required in 35 out of 45 provinces because candidates must secure 40% of the votes to be elected. In Madrid, the forces of the right-wing parties and the Socialist Party are evenly matched. In Cadiz, Badajoz, and Avila, the Radical Party has suffered significant losses, with all seats being won by the right-wing parties. It is reported that Prime Minister Barrios was defeated by a leader of the Catholic Youth League in Seville province. In several provinces, right-wing and Radical Party candidates have formed alliances to oppose the Socialist Party, making the situation highly complex. The Catholic Party leader Robles has been elected. The Communist Party has also won in León and Madrid. The Catholic Party claims to have won in the capitals of 30 provinces, including Andalusia, a stronghold of the Socialist Party. Angered by their defeat, the Socialist Party blames female voters, threatening revolution and street fighting. It is noted that female voters outnumber male voters by 5%, and they mostly voted for right-wing candidates. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid – According to unofficial vote count reports at 1:00 AM this morning in the Spanish general election, popular sentiment is leaning towards the right wing. The Radical Party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Barrios suffered a crushing defeat. Barrios ran as a candidate in Seville but was defeated by a young professor named Bafang by approximately 9,000 votes. In most other provinces, right-wing candidates also emerged victorious. According to People's Party leader Robles, the right wing is assured of 180 seats in the new parliament. This election was relatively peaceful, arguably the least conflict-ridden since Spain became a republic. Only three people died. Voter turnout was very high throughout the country, approximately 80-90%. This was the first time women had the right to vote, which further boosted turnout. In many places, the number of votes cast by women was often three times that of men. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The first general election since the establishment of the Spanish Republic was held today. Reports of strikes and violence are emerging from various locations. Voting commenced nationwide at 9:00 AM this morning. Initial reports from 16 provinces, including former strongholds of the Socialist Party and the extreme left wing, indicate a right-wing victory. However, due to the complexity of the electoral system, a definitive result cannot be estimated until tomorrow. Women are exercising their right to vote for the first time, numbering approximately eight million. Determined to eradicate unrest, their voter turnout far exceeds that of men. The streets of Madrid are thronged with people. Churches are filled with Catholics praying for a favorable outcome. Many women walk in groups, rosaries in hand. One female teacher stood outside a polling station all night, hoping to cast the first female vote. Many nuns and disabled individuals also joined the crowds to vote. It is estimated that half of the electorate had voted within the first two hours. The crowds are jubilant, but the police are heavily guarded. Machine guns are positioned on major streets, and police cars and mounted police patrol back and forth. The order in the capital is relatively good, but disturbances have occurred in many provinces, particularly in Seville and Torrent, where clashes between socialists and the right wing resulted in two deaths and several injuries. In Palma de Mallorca, a bomb exploded, damaging tram tracks and the entrance to a tram depot, causing all trams to be withdrawn. Throughout the day today, troops are stationed at the Bank of Spain headquarters, gas plants, and other public places to provide strict protection. Transportation workers in Barcelona are on strike, hindering travel. It is reported that relatives of former dictator Primo de Rivera have been arrested there. There are also reports of an assassination attempt on the mayor of Puerto Real. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Emphasizes Agriculture; Protects Farmers, Increases Wheat Production</h3>

<h3>Japan Conducts Mass Arrest of Communists; Over a Thousand Reported</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) – The National Council of Japanese Labor Unions, which, under the guidance of red labor organizations and in cooperation with the Japanese Communist Party, continued to engage in bold struggles centered around various factories, suffered a collapse after its members, including Mizogami, Kakuda, Ito, Tanaka, and Ito Ichiro, were arrested in April last year. Only the cadres of the council remained. Later, they attempted to rebuild and expand their influence. The Labor Section of the Police Bureau, in consultation with the Ministry of Interior and the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, notified various newspapers to prohibit the publication of related articles. On February 27 of this year, a large-scale search was conducted by the central authorities, and all members were arrested. This process has continued recently and is now coming to an end. The ban on news coverage was lifted at 5:00 PM on the 20th. The total number of people arrested in this operation is estimated to reach 1,696 (including 68 women and 926 Koreans). 145 people have already been indicted, making this a large-scale arrest unprecedented in modern times.

<h3>Liu Xiang Telegrams Request to Withdraw the Order to Increase Sichuan Salt Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – Liu Xiang telegraphed the following message regarding the Ministry of Finance's plan to increase salt taxes in various regions based on circumstances: "To Finance Minister Kong and Salt Affairs Director Zhu: Regarding the order to increase the Sichuan salt tax in western Hubei by $1.50 per dan, the Yisha Salt Industry Association telegraphed on the 20th to report the situation and request a suspension or exemption to maintain Sichuan salt and protect sales in the region. We have not yet received a reply. Now, the Chongqing Salt Industry Association reports that this is causing losses to Chu markets and begs for the recall of the order to alleviate the heavy tax burden, etc., in order to maintain the Sichuan situation and eliminate hidden dangers. In the past, Sichuan salt supplied Chu and was heavily stockpiled, but recently, Qing and Huai salt have been encroaching on sales. Sichuan merchants' sales have declined daily, resulting in significant losses. The matters presented by the association are indeed real. At this critical juncture when Sichuan is suppressing the Red bandits, if the tax increase leads to merchants suspending transportation, it is inevitable that it will impact workers in production areas, leading to unemployment, and the future is unimaginable. We are therefore telegraphed to urge you to consider the difficulties of the time and withdraw the order to increase the Sichuan salt tax in Yisha. Please reply." (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Japan Expands Shenyang Arsenal, Attaches Chemical Warfare Weapons Manufacturing Plant, and Establishes Offices in Important Areas</h3>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: Since the Soviet Union published the documents revealing Japan's conspiracy regarding the Eastern Railway, the Japanese side has deeply felt that the conflict has become acute. The Kwantung Army is actively engaged in deploying military equipment. In addition to mobilizing elite troops and transporting them to northern Manchuria, it is also greatly expanding the Shenyang Arsenal and establishing machinery repair offices in militarily important areas. These offices are located wherever troops are stationed. Their responsibilities include: (1) Japanese troops stationed in "Manchuria" are all under the control of the Kwantung Army, and all weapons are stored, repaired, and distributed by the Shenyang Arsenal (the offices are auxiliary repair facilities). (2) Except for a small number of simple repairs that can be done at the Shenyang Arsenal, the large-scale manufacturing is all done by the various ordnance factories in Japan. The parts are then shipped to the Shenyang Arsenal for assembly and distribution. (3) The Shenyang Arsenal is responsible for the above-mentioned missions. Its warehouses are fully stocked and specially guarded. At the same time, to prevent delays in military use, small warehouses and small repair shops are set up under the offices in important locations throughout "Manchuria." These are under the special protection of the local garrison and are given special treatment during wartime. (4) New facilities are being built to replace the existing buildings that are not suitable for weapon warehouses, and construction has already begun. (5) To supplement the national ordnance manufacturing efforts, the Shenyang Arsenal has attached a chemical warfare weapons manufacturing plant to its pharmaceutical factory, which serves as a supply depot for the chemical warfare unit. Part of the factory is being borrowed from other facilities, and part is under construction. (6) The well-known Kurume tank unit of Japan moved to Gongzhuling in early October. The Shenyang Arsenal has acquired an additional batch of work, and is currently assembling parts for them.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Attitude During the Fujian Incident: Not Involved in Fujian Turmoil; Another Reason for Li Xiang's Dismissal</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the events in Fujian Province unfolded, the situation in the southwestern provinces has become increasingly tense. Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province, carefully observing the internal and external situations, believes that recuperation and rest are best. Therefore, Chen Mingshu and others held repeated meetings in Hong Kong, but he adopted a non-committal attitude. At the same time, he adopted a policy of strict prevention militarily. Until recently, Chen Mingshu and others made more overt expressions, and Chen Jitang took decisive measures, stripping the military authority from Li Yangjing, commander of the Third Army, and Xiang Hanping, commander of the Second Army, because he suspected that Li and Xiang were colluding with Fujian. Chen Jitang now holds the military authority of the two armies himself. Li's resignation as commander of the Third Army has also been approved. Furthermore, Ouyang Xin, deputy commander of the 8th Division of the Third Army, has been appointed as the chief of staff of the Third Army. Ye Shouchao, commander of the 22nd Regiment of the 8th Division, has been promoted to deputy commander of the 8th Division. Deng Qinglin, director of the Third Army's Logistics Department and concurrently director of the Rear Affairs Office of the army, has also been dismissed. Jian Zuozhen has been appointed to replace him. As for the resigned officers of the Second Army, Chen Jitang has also appointed other personnel to replace them. With Li Xiang removed from his military power, the recent situation in Guangdong will not be affected by the independence of Fujian Province. At the same time, Chen Jitang is actively using former Fourth Army (Zhang Fakui's troops) officers, such as Miao Peinan, who is appointed as the chief of staff of the headquarters and concurrently the director of the training division. Li Hanhun and Deng Longguang also each command a division. Recently, Zhu Huiri returned to Guangdong, and there is news that he has been appointed as the chief advisor of the headquarters. This new army is no less than Chen Jitang's reserve force. Its troops are concentrated in Beijiang, Xijiang, the provincial capital, and Huizhou in Dongjiang. Yu Hanmou, commander of the First Army, has also been stationed in the provincial capital since returning from southern Jiangxi. Therefore, from the current situation, Guangdong Province will not be involved in the Fujian Province turmoil. (November 16th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Municipality Bans Rent Increases on Houses, Provincial Government Promulgates Measures to Ban Renting of Houses</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: In recent years, Guangzhou City has continuously opened up roads, and the city's brokers have raised capital, specializing in industrial speculation and monopoly, resulting in the soaring rental values of houses in the city.

An ordinary family of four cannot manage with a monthly rent of less than 20 or 30 yuan. If a family has six or seven members, they must pay a monthly rent of 50 or 60 yuan, causing housing panic among the middle and lower classes. Even renting a single room costs no less than ten yuan per month. The lament of "Chang'an is not easy to live in" is unexpectedly seen in Guangzhou today. Recently, the Municipal Council has repeatedly suggested on the rent issue, asking to restrict landlords from demanding high rents and asking the authorities to ban rent increases on houses to maintain the livelihood of the common people. It also requests to stipulate proper measures for guaranteeing rented houses. The authorities immediately gathered suggestions from various parties, drafted housing rental regulations, which were revised and passed by the provincial government and promulgated for implementation. The regulations were promulgated yesterday, and the appendix is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations apply to all houses in Guangzhou City used for residence or for residence and small industrial and commercial businesses. Article 2: Rent increases for the houses mentioned in the previous article shall be subject to the following provisions, but this does not apply if the lease contract specifically stipulates rent increase methods: (1) For newly built houses or houses purchased through sales that are rented out after the implementation of these regulations, rent increases are not allowed until five years have passed from the date of the lease. The amount of the rent increase shall not exceed 30% of the original rent. (2) For the period stipulated in the preceding paragraph, if the tenant changes during the period, the five-year period must continue to be satisfied according to the original lease date before the rent can be increased. (3) Before the implementation of these regulations, for all leased houses, if the five-year period has expired and the rent has not been increased, 30% of the original rent may be added. If the ten-year period has expired and the rent has not been increased, 60% of the original rent may be added. However, the basis of the original rent should be based on the police district register. Article 3: The landlord shall not demand any other fees from the tenant under any pretext other than the proper rent and the provisions of these regulations. Article 4: When the landlord rents out the house, he may collect one month's rent as a deposit from the tenant. When the tenant moves out, it can be deducted from the rent for the last month, but the tenant must notify the landlord in writing one month in advance before moving out. Article 5: When renting a house, the tenant must obtain a store's stamped guarantee according to custom, or pay the landlord two months' rent in advance as a guarantee. When moving out, if there are no rent arrears, the landlord shall return the full amount. Article 6: If the tenant commits any of the following circumstances, the landlord may apply to the police district office to order the tenant to move out and recover the rent owed: (1) Owes two months' rent and still does not pay the rent after the landlord's time-limited reminder. (2) Uses the house for illegal purposes for himself or others. (3) Transfers the house to others without the landlord's consent. Article 7: When the landlord sells the house or notifies the tenant of self-occupation or reconstruction, he should immediately go to the police district office to report the situation for the record, for future reference and for the convenience of clearing donations. Article 8: The landlord must notify the tenant to move out one month in advance when taking back the house. If he cannot move out when the deadline expires, the deadline should be extended by two months. However, this does not apply if there is a batch period stipulated. When the landlord takes back the house, he must compensate two months' rent for moving expenses, but the rent must be paid as usual during the moving period. If the tenant owes rent, it should be deducted from the compensation for moving expenses (November 11th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Youths Petition for Living Relief: More Than 100 Participants; Chief Representative Yang Zhen Arrested</h3>
<p>Beiping dispatch: After the fall of Northeast China, volunteer armies rose up to fight for national survival and fought bitterly in the icy and snowy wilderness for two years. Subsequently, after the signing of the Tanggu Truce, the volunteer armies were disbanded in essence, and many drifted to Beiping. Recently, Yang Zhen, a representative of the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army, initiated the organization of the Anti-Japanese Youth League in Beiping, requesting the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Support Association to publish the accounts of anti-Japanese donations and to provide the remaining funds to maintain their livelihood. They had already submitted a report to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting approval for the organization, but there was no response. The Youth League then petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Military Branch Office on the afternoon of the 17th. Chief Representative Yang Zhen was arrested on the way. More than 100 people, including youth, women, and children of the volunteer army, continued to wait at the Municipal Party Headquarters but to no avail. They continued to petition on the 18th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Petition</h3>
<p>Various anti-Japanese youths and their families, including women and children, stranded in Beiping took advantage of the City Consolidation Committee meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters. From 1:00 PM onwards, they gathered in front of the Municipal Party Headquarters, including more than 100 people from the troops of Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and others stranded in Beiping, as well as their families, women, children, and disabled persons. They requested three points: (1) Requesting strict orders for the Support Association to publish the accounts of income and expenditure of donations in the shortest possible time. (2) Requesting that the remaining amount of the Support Association's donations be handed over and fairly distributed by the Party and government authorities to resettle anti-Japanese comrades who are out of school and unemployed. (3) Requesting that living expenses for anti-Japanese comrades stranded in Beiping be provided during the petition. After the representatives gathered, they waited quietly for the chief representative, Yang Zhen, to arrive and proceed with the petition.</p>
<h3>Representative Arrested</h3>
<p>The representatives waited in front of the Municipal Party Headquarters for a long time. By 2:30 PM, Yang Zhen had not yet arrived. Later, it was reported that Yang Zhen had been arrested by military police on the way. Military police also went to Fozhao Tower to search Yang's residence, but found nothing. They only took away all the declarations that the league had printed but not yet distributed. It is reported that the reason for Yang Zhen's arrest, according to related parties, is that the Anti-Japanese Youth League in Beiping has not yet been approved by the authorities for registration and that the public gathering violated police regulations. Because there were many volunteer army officers and soldiers among them, the police did not arrest them, but the military police arrested Chief Representative Yang Zhen, and there were no major issues.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Reply</h3>
<p>The representatives gathered in front of the Municipal Party Headquarters. After hearing that Yang Zhen had been arrested, they immediately elected three representatives, Ren Dingsheng, Liu Jingbo, and Zhou Xueyong, to continue the petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters. Yang Bing, the secretary-general of the Municipal Party Headquarters, met with them. The representatives immediately stated the three points of the petition and said that the urgent task at present was to rescue Chief Representative Yang Zhen. Before Yang Zhen was released, all requests could be carried out later. Yang Bing said that the committee members were holding a meeting in Xihua Hall and that this issue could be brought to the committee members for instructions. The three representatives waited in the reception room, and the other representatives waited in front of the Municipal Party Headquarters. After the meeting in Xihua Hall ended at 5:30 PM, Yang Bing came out again to meet and told the representatives that the Municipal Party Headquarters had no power to release Yang Zhen and that it would be necessary to inquire with the Military Police Headquarters about the actual situation before deciding whether to provide assistance. The three representatives withdrew one after another, and the remaining representatives dispersed at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Second Petition</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Youth League representatives Ms. Yin Binghun, Sun Han, Liu Jingbo, Ren Dingsheng, and Zhou Xueyong went to the Municipal Party Headquarters again at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th to petition. Secretary-General Yang Bing was not there, and no one met with them. Ms. Yin and others then went to the Municipal Government. Mayor Yuan Liang sent Zhu Xingyuan to meet with them. The representatives stated the main points of the petition: (1) Requesting Mayor Yuan to order the immediate release of Yang Zhen. (2) Providing relief to anti-Japanese comrades stranded in Beiping. (3) Requesting the publication of the accounts of anti-Japanese donations. Zhu replied that he could convey the intentions of the gentlemen to the mayor and give a concrete answer next Tuesday. The five representatives then withdrew. (18th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Inspects Hua County, Advocates Resettling Disaster Victims in Special Zone, Provincial Government Sends Letters to Various Departments to Dispatch Personnel for Consultation</h3>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: Liu Zhi took a special train to Zhengzhou on the morning of the 15th and transferred to northern Henan for inspection. After crossing the river and arriving at the north bank at noon, he disembarked to inspect the dikes around Miaogong and the disaster situation in Wuzhi County. Wherever he went, he inquired about the hardships of the people. He transferred from Muluan Township to Zhan Township and boarded the special train north again. At 7:30 PM, he arrived at Daokou Township. Xie Suian, the magistrate of Hua County, and representatives from the commercial and academic circles of the town met with him. He spent the night in the train. On the morning of the 16th, Ren Bang, the magistrate of Jun County, and personnel from the county's Party headquarters met with him. Liu gave instructions on the reorganization of the Daokou Chamber of Commerce. Then, at 8:00 AM, he led Chen Ruzhen, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, to Hua County. After leaving the city, they switched to a small boat and visited the disaster areas of Baliying, Nanyangliu, Anshang Village, etc. The floodwaters had not receded and were still a vast expanse. The water flow at the Yellow River breach was very rapid, even greater than the downstream water势. Currently, there is no hope of cultivation. The disaster victims are scattered, separated from their families, crying from hunger and cold, a miserable sight. More than 10,000 people, supporting the old and carrying the young, prostrated themselves on the roadside begging for help. They returned to the city at 2:00 PM. He instructed Magistrate Xie to investigate the number of disaster victims capable of farming so that they could be given relief separately. At 4:30 PM, he returned to Daokou, and the special train departed at 6:30 PM. That night, it passed through Xinxiang and headed north. It is estimated that there are 300,000 disaster victims in Hua County, and their cries of suffering are everywhere, hoping for relief. Liu plans to have the government provide relief on the one hand and resettle some of the disaster victims in areas of southern Henan that have been devastated by the Red Bandits, where there is no smoke from cooking fires, so that they have land to cultivate and homes to live in. He has telegraphed the secretariat of the provincial government to send letters to various departments for consultation on how to proceed and to raise cotton clothes to keep the disaster victims warm, because the 17,000 sets allocated by the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association a few days ago are still not enough to distribute. The secretariat has sent letters to various departments to send personnel to gather at the provincial government at 2:00 PM this afternoon for consultation. (18th)</p>
<h3>Kaocheng and Lanfeng Dike Closure Project Begins: First Build Earth Embankment with Sand Inside and Silt Outside; Approximately 4,000 Workers Employed at Two Locations</h3>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: The counties of Kaocheng and Lanfeng were the most severely affected by this year's Yellow River flood in Henan Province on the south bank. It is now winter, and the water level has dropped sharply. The First Engineering Office began working on closing the breaches in the middle of last month. To understand the true situation, the reporter visited the area a few days ago. The so-called Lanfeng breach refers to the southern end of Xiaoxin Dike. Reports of the breaches in Cailou Township, Tongwaxiang, and Zhenpu all refer to this. An earth embankment is now being built from the southern end of Xiaoxin Dike to the ancient road cliff about four li south to close the breach. It is eight meters wide at the base and three meters high, with sand inside and a one-meter-thick layer of silt outside. When construction began, there was still about a foot of water on the planned dike line. Earth-filled sacks were used to create a layer in the water, and then workers were instructed to take sand from the dry Yellow River channel to lay the dike base and the core. Each layer was packed with wooden or stone hammers to compact the soil. Then, silt was transported from the south bank of the old channel using iron-gauge carts on light-duty narrow-gauge railways and piled on both sides of the dike core. The built part is now about two meters high and has completed two-thirds of the entire dike project. The so-called Kaocheng dike breach refers to Yueti southwest of Renzhuang. Reports of the Simingtang breach and the Yuanzhai breach refer to this. A straight earth embankment is now being built from the Daxin Dike south of Yantan, directly connected to the levee behind Guying Village. The width, height, internal sand and external silt, and the use of wooden and stone hammer packing are the same as the Lanfeng project. Small carts are used to transport the sand and silt. It has now been built to a height of about 1.8 or 9 meters and has completed six-tenths of the entire dike project. According to engineers, both projects can be completed completely this year, with a total cost of about 60,000 yuan. However, because the dike with internal sand and external silt is not very solid, it may still collapse in the event of a flood. The agency responsible for guiding and supervising the project is the First Temporary District Engineering Office of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee. The office moved to Sanyizhai northwest of Lanfeng on October 10 and set up the First Works Office in Dinggantang Village, one li south of the old channel. The Second Works Office was set up outside the west gate of Simingtang, south of the Kaocheng dike breach. Each office has an engineer to guide the construction method and supervise the workers, as well as supervisors, general affairs, accounting, and other staff. The temporary engineering office has a radio station that reports the progress of work to the Gongzhen Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association on Dongerdao Street, Kaifeng, every day. The First Works Office in Lanfeng employs about 2,000 workers, and the Second Works Office in Kaocheng employs about 1,100 workers. The purpose is to provide relief through work. The wages for earthwork are six jiao per square ocean within 59 nanometers, and for those within 200 nanometers, the amount is increased according to the original fixed price. Later, due to the shortage of workers in Kaocheng, more than 800 people were recruited, and the total number of people at the two locations is now about 4,000, all of whom are disaster victims. Because their lives and property are at stake, the projects they are working on are very solid. However, the initial plan of the Water Conservancy Commission for the two projects called for an expenditure of 600,000 yuan and the use of reed rope, earth, stone, and other works to last a long time. Later, due to financial constraints, the current plan was revised, and the strength to protect the lives and property of the people in the two counties seems to be slightly weak. (18th)</p>
<h3>Henan Province Distributes Clothing and Funds for Disaster Relief: 500,000 Disaster Victims in the Province; 37,000 Sets of Clothing; 100,000 Yuan in Temporary Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: This year, the Yellow River flooded, and Henan Province suffered particularly severe damage. Now that harsh winter has arrived, no fewer than 500,000 disaster victims are crying out for food and lack clothing to ward off the cold. The Henan Disaster Relief Committee, together with Yang Mingsheng, the Henan Investigation and Relief Director of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Group, repeatedly discussed and properly allocated clothing and funds to avoid the drawbacks of unfairness. A total of 37,000 sets of clothing were received in two installments and distributed as follows: 17,000 sets to Hua County, 3,500 sets to Fengqiu, 3,000 sets to Lanfeng, 3,000 sets to Kaocheng, 2,000 sets to Wuzhi, 2,000 sets to Wen County, 1,800 sets to Kaifeng, 1,000 sets to Sishui, 1,000 sets to Zheng County, 1,000 sets to Mengjin, 340 sets to Chenliu, 160 sets to Yucheng, and 120 sets to Meng County. There are still 1,080 sets remaining. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Henan Disaster Relief Committee held its second meeting at the Civil Affairs Department. Those present included Li Peiji, Zhang Jingyu, Yang Mingsheng, Fang Qidao, and ten others. During the meeting, Yang Mingsheng proposed a plan for how to allocate the 100,000 yuan in temporary emergency relief funds allocated. It was decided that the standard would be to prioritize counties where disaster victims could not survive without relief. The counties with the most severe disasters were: Hua County (40,000 yuan), Lanfeng (10,000 yuan), Kaocheng (8,000 yuan), Wuzhi (6,500 yuan), Wen County (4,000 yuan), and Fengqiu (6,500 yuan). The next most severely affected counties were: Kaifeng, Mengjin, and Meng County (1,000 yuan each). The next most severely affected counties were: Guangwu, Sishui, Zhongmu, Minquan, Gong County, and Yucheng (500 yuan each). Other topics discussed included how to purchase grain for winter relief and how to establish reception centers for disaster victims in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. Yang Mingsheng reported to the Disaster Relief Group on his recent investigation of the disaster situation in various counties and the emergency relief distribution situation, and requested instructions on handling winter relief in Henan. He took a train east to Shanghai tonight. (14th)</p>
<h3>Resolution of Party-Government Dispute in Hubei Province: All Offensive Notices to Be Revoked; Provincial Government Sends Letter of Regret to Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The party-government dispute in Hubei Province has gradually been resolved through the mediation of Yu Xilai, the Central Kuomintang's inspector of party affairs in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. The provincial government has now replied to the provincial party headquarters, revoking all notices offensive to the party headquarters and expressing regret. The provincial party headquarters did not pursue the matter further, and the case was resolved smoothly. As for Huang Danchu, the magistrate of Huangmei County, whose malfeasance and harm to the people have been confirmed, the Supervisory Yuan has already transferred him for disciplinary action, and the provincial government has no intention of condoning him. His dismissal from office is no longer a question. The provincial party headquarters believes that Huang was originally a party member and should be punished according to national law and party discipline. It was specifically resolved to submit the case to the Central Supervisory Committee for handling. The provincial government's official letter to the provincial party headquarters is recorded as follows: "In direct response, recently read your official letter instructing the Civil Affairs Department to withdraw Training Order No. 2725 and revoke all notices posted by its affiliated agencies, etc. Regarding this case, the Huangmei County Party Headquarters and various groups have previously sent repeated telegrams to the government, accusing Huang Danchu, the magistrate of the county. The government then transferred the matter to the Civil Affairs Department to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and report on the case as a basis for verification and handling. Subsequently, we received repeated orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the Encirclement and Suppression of Bandits in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces to investigate and report. We previously submitted a document stating the situation and informed the Civil Affairs Department. This is the process by which the government handled this case. Yesterday, we read a newspaper report about the Public Security Bureau's Announcement No. 9. The government instructed the department to investigate and report. According to Director Meng of the Civil Affairs Department, the department received instructions from Your Excellency and the director approved the transfer to the relevant department for handling. However, Cao Mingwu, the drafting officer, believed that the full text stated that 'hereafter, complaints against officials that do not follow the prescribed procedures will not be accepted,' which should be made known to the public. Therefore, he added the phrase 'announce to the public' in addition to the transfer. However, he failed to handle the section concerning the Huangmei County Party Headquarters separately. This was his mistake and there was no other intention. The department also sent the government the department's files for review. It was found that the director of the department did not approve the order to issue a notice to the subordinate agencies. The drafting officer's handling was incorrect and highly inappropriate. The department was instructed to order the Public Security Bureau and other agencies to revoke the second notice. This is the process by which the government handled the matter after discovering the incident. Now, in accordance with your letter, in addition to ordering the Civil Affairs Department to withdraw Training Order No. 2725 and revoke all notices posted by its affiliated agencies, the government must also state that since the government was reorganized, it has received the spirit of cooperation between your association and the party, and has worked together with all its heart. The colleagues of the government deeply admire this. Director Meng has served under the party for many years and has always worked harmoniously with party agencies. He has no intention of insulting or attacking the party. This incident occurred due to an error by the drafting officer. Not only does the director deeply blame himself, but the government also deeply regrets it. In addition to the department already punishing the person responsible, we hereby reply for your information." (17th)</p>
<h3>Shandong's Provincial Telephone Network Expected to Be Completed by the End of This Year; Active Reorganization of Provincial and County Telephones</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The provincial telephone network is one of the major construction projects in the province in recent years. Of the province's 108 counties, 102 have telephone branch offices, with a total of 11,966 li of telephone lines. Only Tancheng in southern Shandong, and Rongcheng, Wendeng, Muping in eastern Shandong, and Shidao Town in the Weihai area have not yet been completed. The remaining areas are fully equipped. The Department of Construction is now actively constructing the unfinished areas, aiming to complete the great task of the provincial telephone network by the end of this year. After the turn of the year, the entire province will be able to communicate fully, in all directions. This will not only allow government orders to be communicated to the entire province instantly, but also greatly facilitate the transmission of news for merchants and the public. The provincial and county long-distance telephones are also being actively improved. The provincial telephones are the main lines of the Jinan-Yi, Jinan-Cao, Jinan-Dong, Jinan-Wu, and Jinan-Lai districts, all with Jinan as their hub. However, due to the large number of lines within the city, there are often disturbances. Starting today, the reorganization of various lines in Jinan City will begin to ensure clear voice transmission. All 108 counties have established county-owned telephones. County-owned lines and provincial-owned lines can be connected to each other for communication. However, county-owned lines are mostly single lines, while provincial-owned lines are mostly double lines. However, due to the burden of telephones in various counties, their effectiveness is also equivalent to single lines. Previously, the Department of Construction convened a meeting of telephone bureau chiefs, who resolved to request the Department of Construction to instruct all counties to change to double lines. They are currently being converted and will soon be completely improved. (17th)</p>

<h3>Old Woman Commits Suicide After Being Humiliated</h3>
<p>Xu Zhu, a resident of Zhujiajiao Town, Second District of this county, was known for her shrewish nature. Twenty years ago, her husband, Xu Kangmin, committed suicide by swallowing opium smoke out of anger at Zhu's improper behavior. On the 20th of last month, her aunt, Xi, suddenly secretly swallowed the water Zhu used to wash her hair and face with, and then committed suicide. It was widely rumored that Zhu had recently demanded a title deed from her aunt to provide her lover, Gu, as collateral for a loan, but her request was not granted, and she harbored deep resentment. Moreover, on the night of the twelfth, Gu was in Zhu's room when he was caught by her aunt, which led to an argument. Zhu slapped Xi's face. Xi, who was old and humiliated, committed this tragedy. The Xu clan was outraged and Zhu fled immediately. It is said that the case has been filed with the county government and is scheduled to be heard on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Special Investigator from the Baoye Commission Arrives in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, in order to develop the national industry and rescue the economic panic, divided the country into six industrial survey areas. Each area was assigned a director and a number of investigators were appointed to be responsible for investigating the industrial conditions in the area. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were divided into one area, and Mei Songnan was appointed as the director of the investigation. After being appointed, Mei immediately began to carry out the investigation and decided that the survey locations in Jiangsu Province would be 12 counties, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Jiangdu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Huaiyin, Nantong, Changshu, Tongshan, and Wuxi. The scope of the investigation was divided into categories such as agriculture, industry, commerce, fisheries and animal husbandry, minerals, economic cooperatives, labor schools, labor-management disputes, special industries, and agricultural products. The size of the region, the length of the facts, and the differences in nature were used to appropriately classify and conduct precise surveys. The reports were submitted in stages at any time, and the investigation forms were compiled and reviewed. There were as many as 63 types. The deadline was June 1934. Mei came to Wuxi the day before yesterday and stayed at the Railway Hotel. He immediately started the investigation. The county government of this county sent staff to guide and assist him. So far, only one-third of the entire planned work has been investigated. The most difficult thing to investigate is that the persons in charge of the factories are mostly unwilling to report the actual situation in detail, so it is difficult to obtain the truth. However, Wuxi is a prosperous area with many factories, and there are more labor-management disputes than in other counties. Recently, the Huisheng Silk Factory went bankrupt due to debts, and the factory owner absconded with the money. Workers at the Ganshen Silk Factory also launched a strike due to issues such as work treatment. All of this exposes the economic panic. The failure to take into account the lives and education of workers is the most noteworthy point in the industrial survey.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner's Office Thoroughly Investigates Murder Case</h3>
<p>Gong Yuezhou, the head of Xia Yu Township in the Fourth District, and villagers Wu A'er and Feng Baogen, etc., opened a gambling den in the Bai Shou Temple in Daishang Village of the township on the 12th of last month. Liu Chunlan, the head of the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, sent police officers to arrest the gamblers Wu Ating and Ma Xuxing, etc., totaling seven people. During the chaos, Gu Zongxiang and Wu Genshou drowned after falling into the river. The county court prosecutor then went to examine the bodies and released the gamblers and the police officers involved on bail. The villagers then accused the chief of the branch bureau, Liu Chunlan, of multiple offenses and filed a complaint with the provincial government. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered the county to dismiss Liu first and wait for investigation. Yesterday, Hou Ticheng, an investigator from the Second District Commissioner's Office, came to Wuxi to thoroughly investigate the case. He first went to the scene of the incident to investigate, and then went to the County Court, County Government, and Public Security Bureau to investigate. He returned to Changzhou the same night to report back.</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Opium Seized at Port</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the 19th, the Suchang morning shift Jixing Wheel arrived in Changshu. When the wheel was alongside the shore, a passenger from another province stood at the bow of the ship, carrying a small leather suitcase, intending to be the first to disembark. Unexpectedly, he was seen by Song Peigen, a petitioner police officer from the Wheel Bureau. Recently, after the robbery of the wheel during the day, the inspection of suspicious persons was extremely strict. The passenger saw the police officer paying attention and returned to the cabin, disembarking from the stern of the ship and heading straight to the small alley of Yizhuang Lane. The police officer chased after him, wanting to check his suitcase. The man deliberately broke the key, claiming that it could not be opened. The police officer became more suspicious and asked him to go to the Public Security Sub-station. The two men then began to conflict. Fortunately, another police officer arrived to help arrest him. Under the supervision of Inspector Song and others, the lock was opened and it was found to contain opium. The packages were engraved with the Ge Ganji brand, weighing a total of 276 taels, including 14 taels of red earth and one opium cake, weighing one catty and four taels. When questioned, the man gave his name as Cheng Xueyi, 32 years old, from Hefei, Anhui. He said that the box was entrusted to him by a friend and he did not know what was inside. However, the Public Security Bureau's investigation revealed that the opium was entrusted to him by Xiaojiangdong, a well-known opium trafficker in Suzhou, to be transported to Changshu and delivered to Xushi Town. The Public Security Sub-station believed that the case was serious and immediately sent the suspect and witnesses to the General Bureau for further investigation and legal processing.</p>

<h3>Jimei Pawnshop Expected to Reopen</h3>
<p>The Jimei Pawnshop on West Street in this county, which was opened by Sheng Jisun, was about to be closed down by Sheng last year. Through the maintenance of local figures such as Zhu Danqing, the Sheng's Yuzhai Charity Association repeatedly discussed and agreed to join as a shareholder. Zhu Danqing and others raised another 100,000 yuan of capital, which has now been fully raised. On the 18th, a fundraising committee was convened at Yiyuan, and it was decided to raise another 50,000 yuan, pay Sheng 10,000 yuan in foreign currency, and clear the payment by the end of December. It is also a gospel for the future of the people's economy.</p>

<h3>Land Survey Implemented in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government, under orders to reorganize the land and carry out a survey, began root mapping in the urban area around August of this year, and has achieved considerable results. It is now urgent to continue the household land mapping in order to achieve success. A survey team has been established and dispatched to carry out the work in the urban area. Landowners located in the urban area must fill in each item in detail on the household land survey form issued by the survey office. When the surveyors measure the land, they will hand in the survey form for review and personally lead the way to indicate the boundaries in order to emphasize land administration.</p>

<p>Chen Dingyao and his younger brother Chen Si, from Haizhou, had served in the military for many years in the past. After leaving the military, they moved to Fanlu Township, Second District of Baoying, and purchased farmland, which has been many years. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 15th, sixteen thugs suddenly came and drew out sharp blades as they entered the house, hacking at Chen Dingyao and his brother Chen Si. The heads of the Chen brothers were split open, and they fell to the ground and died on the spot. The scene was extremely tragic. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled immediately. The Chen family has reported the case to the Baoying County Government, requesting an investigation, autopsy, and strict arrest and punishment of the murderers.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Security Office Executes Bandit</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, based on the submission of a bandit named Chen Qiwang by the FenShui County Government, ordered an interrogation and confirmed that the bandit had conspired with Zhou Li, Mao Cun, and seven others in the home of Wang Yang in Si Ling Township, FenShui County, to jointly rob and kidnap Yang Qi, Ye Da Zhu, demanding a ransom of 1,000 yuan. They later released Ye after receiving 150 yuan. The bandit shared the stolen money and hid in the home of Ye Pinnai in Danxia Wu, where he was arrested by the security regiment. The victim testified that he was definitely a robber. Chen also confessed to his crimes. He was sentenced to death and executed by shooting outside Qingbo Gate at 8:00 AM yesterday (19th) after verifying his identity.</p>

<h3>Ferocious Woman Buries Maid Alive</h3>
<p>In Jingwan, Meixi Town, Huzhou, there is a farmer named Li Xiantong, from Henan. Recently, due to livelihood difficulties, he sold his biological daughter, Zai Mao, to Wang Laoqi, a villager near Jingwan, as a maid last year. At that time, Zai Mao was only seven years old. However, Wang Laoqi was born cruel and often abused Zai Mao, resulting in her body being covered with scars. Li Xiantong had repeatedly heard that his daughter was suffering, but due to circumstances, he could only sigh. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 13th of this month, Wang Laoqi inhumanly carried Zai Mao to Heshangdun near Jingwan and buried her alive. When her body was half-buried, Zai Mao cried and wept in pain, begging pitifully. The person digging the burial discovered her conscience and stopped working. Li Xiantong, the girl's father, had heard the news and rushed to the scene. He took Zai Mao back, and she was able to live again. However, Zai Mao's body was covered with scars and she was seriously ill. It is said that Li plans to sue the court and arrest Wang to face the law.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Editor Arrested for Framing</h3>
<p>A local tabloid called "Social Daily" is run by Yao Shuizhang, the son of Yao Baoxing, a local constable. Since its publication, it has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits. Yesterday, Yao colluded with two Hunanese who had previously worked in the county government, and local retired police officers, posing as members of the anti-opium agency, to search Fuzhen Temple outside the North Gate for opium. When they searched the abbot's bedroom, Yao took out a paper package from his pocket, threw it on the bed, and said, "What is this if not opium?" Unexpectedly, the monks and laymen who were accompanying the inspection caught a glimpse and shouted that Yao was framing them. Yao immediately fled. This greatly angered the public, and many people gathered to arrest the two retired policemen. The rest scattered in the confusion. Yao Shuizhang returned to the city and reported to the Public Security Bureau, saying that their subordinates were extorting money outside the North Gate. He also went to the county government and reported to a certain official that the Public Security Bureau had instructed its subordinates to falsely accuse honest people in an attempt to shirk responsibility. After a while, the two offenders were brought in, and it was learned that Yao was the mastermind. The Public Security Bureau used an unexpected means to send police officers to his home in the middle of the night and arrest Yao. It was heard this afternoon that Yao and his accomplices would be sent to the county for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Water Police Disturb Theater</h3>
<p>Last night, as the Xinmin Theater in Beisi Lane was about to open, more than twenty water police officers suddenly rushed in and seized Xu Liansheng, an employee, and beat him in a circle. The theater was thrown into chaos, and bystanders were afraid of their ferocity and dared not intervene. They then dragged him out of the theater, punching, kicking, and stamping on him until he was covered in scars and blood. Then, they released him, formed a line, and left. The theater employees were confused. When they questioned Xu, he said that there was no animosity. However, yesterday, a deputy commander of the team came to watch the play, accompanied by a woman. He assumed that the deputy commander could enter without a ticket, but accompanying guests were required to pay. Therefore, he asked them to pay for the ticket. The deputy commander glared at him and ignored him. He was reluctant to argue with him. He had no other connection with them. The theater believes that the theater is a business for the people, and it should not be allowed for government officials to trample on it at will. They have prepared a telegram to complain to the province, and will not stop until the perpetrators are punished.</p>

<h3>Collision of Sailing Boats Drowns Boatman</h3>
<p>On the 18th at noon at Dongjiangzui, Qiantang River, Xiaoshan, a small pig boat coming from upstream and a firewood boat collided due to unfavorable winds and sails, resulting in a dispute. Ah Wei, the boatman of the small pig boat, knocked a crew member of the firewood boat into the river and drowned him. The crew members of the firewood boat gathered more than ten companions and threw all the small pigs into the river, totaling thirty-seven, most of which drowned. At that time, both parties went ashore at Wenyen and filed a lawsuit with the County Court.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Jiangxi Refugees Disturb Peace</h3>
<p>A large number of Jiangxi refugees arrived in Jiudun Anchang, Dongxiang, on the night of the 18th and disturbed the peace of every household. The Xu family in Jiudun was forced to give silver dollars by the refugees, resulting in the destruction of tables and chairs. On the 19th, they went to Yifeng and caused a great disturbance. The Xiang Office secretly reported to the Anchang Police Station, which sent police to suppress them and they were able to leave the area.</p>

<h3>Coup in Fujian Province Becomes a Reality; People's Government Appears Yesterday; Li Jishen as Chairman, or Possibly Hu Hanmin; Chen Cai and Chen Youren, etc., Appointed to Key Positions; Fuzhou Central Bank Has Been Sealed Off; Transportation Normal Except for Telegrams</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The coup in Fujian Province has been fluctuating in recent days, but ultimately, Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu, in their final political struggle, have taken a desperate gamble. Yesterday morning, the Fujian Provincial People's Congress finally passed the political program and list of candidates for the independent government. The various news items are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Political Organization</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the People's Government is Li Jishen. Underneath are five committee members: (1) Chairman of the Political Committee: Chen Mingshu, (2) Chairman of the Military Committee: Cai Tingkai, (3) Chairman of the Finance Committee: Xu Chongqing, (4) Chairman of the Education Committee: Zhang Bojun, (5) Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee: Chen Youren. According to the composition of the above people, the factions are quite complex.</p>
<h3>The So-Called Political Program</h3>
<p>The so-called Provisional National People's Congress was held in Fuzhou yesterday morning. A preparatory office had been set up in advance, and the Fujian Provincial Government was instructed in the name of the preparatory office to notify its subordinates to participate. The meeting was ostensibly composed of agriculture, industry, commerce, school, military and government, without a party name. It was resolved to issue a declaration of the rights of the people, advocating the abolition of unequal treaties, the realization of tariff autonomy first, the people's absolute freedom of assembly, publication, strikes, and belief, equal protection of physical and mental labor, distribution of land based on population, and nationalization of forests and mines.</p>
<h3>Various Factions Active</h3>
<p>The Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, and the Trotskyist-Chen faction are the main driving forces behind the scenes. Young literary figures such as Hu Qiuyuan, who were originally engaged in writing at the Shenzhou Guoguang Society in Shanghai, have now become Chen Mingshu's advisors. Huang Qixiang, Zhang Bojun, and other Third Party leaders are particularly active in the dark.</p>
<h3>Financial News</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, foreign sources in this city reported that the Xiamen branch of the Central Bank has been sealed off by the Fujian authorities, and remittances are no longer possible. The market in Fujian Province is in chaos. The Fuzhou County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking whether Central Bank exchange coupons are still used normally in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. The City Chamber of Commerce immediately telegraphed back that the coupons are still used normally.</p>
<h3>Transportation Situation</h3>
<p>When the reporter obtained the accurate news of the coup in Fujian Province, he immediately inquired with various transportation agencies about the current status of transportation between Shanghai and Fujian. According to Hua Shijian, the business manager of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Fuzhou telegraph line, south of Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province, was broken due to the blasting of mountains for road construction since the evening of the 19th, and is not related to the Fujian coup. Repairs are currently underway, and it is expected that normal reporting will be possible tomorrow (i.e., today). As for the ships traveling the Shanghai-Fuzhou route, they are the Taishun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Jiesheng of the EWO, the Wanxiang of the Sanbei, and the Huaan of the Changan. The Wanxiang of the Sanbei left Shanghai for Fuzhou as usual at 6 PM last night. The Jiesheng of the EWO is scheduled to sail to Fuzhou today. In addition, the postal service was still normal yesterday.</p>
<h3>Private Telegram</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: Regarding the brewing of the coup in Fujian Province, the situation became tense again yesterday. According to a private telegram received by a certain Fujian native in Shanghai yesterday (the 20th), the Fuzhou Municipal People's Congress yesterday passed the following list of candidates for the People's Government: Chairman: Hu Hanmin, Vice Chairman: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Military Committee: Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief: Chen Mingshu, Chairman of Finance: Xu Chongqing, Chairman of Foreign Affairs: Chen Youren, Chairman of Education: Zhang Bojun. The policies are: (1) Resistance to Japan, (2) Suppression of Communists, (3) Land Revolution. It is heard that Hu Hanmin is still in Hong Kong and has not yet gone to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Source News</h3>
<p>Ri Ri News Agency reports: According to a certain source, the Fujian Provincial Government did convene a people's representative conference yesterday, attended by more than one hundred people. They passed the organization of the "Revolutionary Government of the Chinese National Alliance" and decided on the political program and list of candidates. The content of the political program roughly advocates tariff autonomy, the abolition of unequal treaties, the people's right to strike and freedom of belief, and the nationalization of all land, forests, and mines. It also aims to resist Japan, but cancels the slogan of suppressing bandits, which has attracted much attention. In addition, the "Revolutionary United Army of the Chinese National Alliance" was formed, abolishing the Blue Sky White Sun flag, establishing the Production Party on the basis of the Third Party and the Social Democratic Party, and creating another flag. Hu Hanmin has not yet arrived in Fujian, so Li Jishen is acting as the chairman.</p>
<h3>Central Attitude</h3>
<p>Ri Ri News Agency reports: Since the Fujian coup occurred, the atmosphere has once become calm. For the sake of appeasement, the Central Government initially adopted a wait-and-see attitude, hoping for the Fujian Provincial Authorities' awakening. Unexpectedly, it suddenly became tense again in a few days. Yesterday, a certain naval commander in this city told a Ri Ri News Agency reporter that after President Wang returned to Beijing, he decided to resolve the Fujian affair politically. If necessary, he would send personnel to Fujian to persuade and cancel the plan. Therefore, there was a proposal for Chen Zhaoying and Duan Xipeng to go to Fujian. President Wang believes that the time is appropriate and summoned Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Naval Fleet, by telegram this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to immediately go to Beijing to discuss the plan for mediating the Fujian affair. After receiving the order, Chen left Shanghai for Beijing by plane at 1:30 PM today (i.e., yesterday) to meet President Wang. He plans to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). If necessary, Chen may also go to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Song Qingling Did Not Go to Fujian</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report from Fuzhou, Sun Yat-sen's widow, Madam Song Qingling, had arrived in Fuzhou. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter visited Madam Sun's residence on Avenue Molière (today's Huaihai Zhong Road), but she was out. Her family members said that Madam Sun was indeed in Shanghai but had gone out on business. The reporter then inquired with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at his residence, who replied that the news from Fujian stating that Madam Sun had arrived in Fuzhou was completely inaccurate, as he had spoken with Madam Sun on the phone that very morning. As for the matter of General Cai Tingkai being summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he had no knowledge of it.</p>
<h3>News from Naval Circles</h3>
<p>The Min Yan News Agency reports that since Huang Qiang took office as the Garrison Commander of Zhangzhou and Xiamen, Lin Guogeng, the Commander of the Xiamen Naval Port, has sent numerous lengthy telegrams to the naval authorities, reporting on the situation there. According to claims from the 19th Route Army, the army is responsible for the local administration of Xiamen, while the naval port defense remains under the navy. Currently, a state of peace is being maintained. However, yesterday's political change in Fujian has officially materialized. The Mawei Naval Port Headquarters is close to the provincial capital, and the large-scale Mawei Naval Shipyard is also located there. If, unfortunately, the situation escalates into military action, the defense of Mawei will also be a serious issue between the army and navy. It is reported that the commander of the naval port, Li Mengbin, sends daily telegrams to the naval department.</p>
<h3>Chiang Yan's Statement</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that Chiang Yan, the Brigade Commander of the 166th Brigade of the 56th Division stationed in Fujian, resigned from his post in Fujian and came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, staying at the residence of his friend Tao Jianfeng. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter visited him yesterday and inquired about the truth of the Fujian Incident. He issued the following written statement: (1) He had no mission here and, due to his position, did not wish to comment on the Fujian situation to avoid causing misunderstandings; (2) Fujian is currently quite peaceful, but due to rumors, a state of martial law has been lightly imposed. Correspondence, telegrams, and news are being checked. All agencies are operating as usual; (3) Chiang Yan's future actions will depend on orders from his superiors; (4) Although some prominent individuals out of office have gone to Fujian, they are traveling and visiting friends. The rumors are being spread by disgruntled elements; (5) There is no news regarding the rumors that Chiang Yan will be transferred to Jiangxi to suppress bandits or appointed as a councilor to the Military Advisory Council.</p>
<h3>General Yang Going to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that Yang Dezhao, the representative in Nanjing of Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon. It is learned that Yang will depart from Shanghai for Nanjing today (the 21st) to pay his respects to Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and report on everything. It is said that after arriving in Nanjing, Yang will travel to Jiangxi to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and present a statement.</p>
<h3>Zhang and Lu Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Min Yan News Agency reports that Zhang Zhen, former Commander of the 49th Division of Fujian and a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. Since his removal from military command, he has devoted himself to the party affairs of the Central Government. He does not wish to comment on the current changes in the political situation in Fujian. It is also reported that Lu Xingrong, the Deputy Commander of the newly formed 2nd Division, recently went to Nanjing to visit important figures and report on defense matters. He had become ill due to overwork during the recent bandit suppression campaign, and his condition was aggravated by the long journey. He has returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and has been admitted to a hospital for treatment. His relatives, friends, and subordinates here have been visiting him.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Speaks Painfully About the Fujian Incident: The Country is Facing Many Difficulties and Should Not Be Divided, Liu Weizhi Will Still Go to Jiangxi After Arriving in Shanghai, No News About Chen Youren Going to Fujian</h3>
<p>The brewing of the Fujian affair has become a reality. Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspapers visited Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke to inquire about the Fujian Incident and his views on the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Brewing of the Fujian Incident is Gradually Becoming a Reality</h3>
<p>Sun Ke first stated, "Li Jishen has indeed arrived in Fujian. I do not know if Chen Youren has also arrived in Fujian. I have heard that their People's Government will be established in Fuzhou. I also do not know if they have issued a circular telegram. However, I know that the Central Bank in Fujian has been confiscated. The brewing of the Fujian incident is indeed gradually becoming a reality."</p>
<h3>The Issue of Welcoming Hu and Others to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the Central Government welcoming Hu Hanmin, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and Feng Yuxiang to Nanjing. Sun Ke replied, "This matter may have been decided temporarily by President Wang after he returned to Nanjing from Shanghai the day before yesterday. I do not yet know the specifics." Sun Ke also stated that when the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee held a meeting in Shanghai last Saturday, they had discussed the Fujian Incident but only exchanged information and did not conduct a formal discussion.</p>
<h3>The Country is Facing Many Difficulties and Should Not Be Divided</h3>
<p>Sun Ke continued, "In my personal observation, Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Chen Youren, and Mr. Chen Zhenru of the 19th Route Army have always been relied upon by the Central Government and have a long history in the party and the country. Reason dictates that they would not take such action. Even if they disagree with the Central Government's policies or have personal disagreements, they should communicate frankly and not involve politics or military matters lightly, which would result in the country being divided when it is already facing many difficulties. This would make it even more difficult to rectify domestic affairs and respond to foreign threats. In my opinion, at this time, we should unite, seek common defense against external enemies, and work together to strengthen the country."</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi Visited Sun Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>He also said, "Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weizhi has already arrived in Shanghai from Jiangxi via Nanjing this morning and has met with me. The discussion was about the Fujian situation. However, Liu's trip to Jiangxi was not on my behalf but was in response to Chiang's summons for a face-to-face discussion." According to Liu, Chairman Chiang and others hope that the Fujian situation will not become a reality. According to reporters, Liu Weizhi will report to various parties in Nanjing and Shanghai and then return to Nanchang next Friday, or the following week if there is not enough time, to report to Chiang.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Russia</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Sun Ke also spoke at length about the issue of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has already materialized. The obvious reason for the resumption of diplomatic relations is economic relations: the United States wants to obtain foreign markets for its economic recovery plan, while Russia wants to obtain machinery, cotton raw materials, and credit loans. In reality, it is also said that the focus of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is the Far East issue. The two sides have some kind of military agreement. If, unfortunately, changes occur in the Far East, a union between the United States and Russia is indeed possible. In terms of strength, although Japan's army and navy are currently strong, they are not as strong as the United States and Russia, which is naturally unfavorable to Japan. However, air power is the key to this matter, and it depends on whether there are any changes in the policies of the Japanese military. If Japan still dreams of realizing its continental policy, then unfortunate events are difficult to predict. But no matter who wins or loses, Japan will inevitably occupy North China as a base against Russia and blockade our coastal ports against the United States. Our country will inevitably suffer misfortune and great losses will be difficult to avoid.</p>
<h3>Tension in Fujian Causes Guest Merchants to Suspend Trade, and Many Ships Cancel Cargo</h3>
<p>Since the Fujian authorities announced martial law, the shipping and trade industries in Shanghai have been affected, with trade suspended and the market disrupted. The details obtained by reporters are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Suspension of Trade</h3>
<p>After the resolution of the dispute between the Sanshan Guild Hall and the National Goods Introduction Office, the Fujian fabric merchants, general merchandise merchants, and grain merchants have been rushing to load large quantities of goods onto the Sanbei, Changan, Yihua, and other ships bound for Fujian. In the past ten days, the ships bound for Fujian have been fully loaded with export goods, and many later arrivals have had to withdraw their customs declarations. The congestion of cargo transportation is rare. Unexpectedly, a sudden change in the Fujian situation occurred, and Fuzhou was suddenly placed under martial law. The news spread, causing unease. Yesterday, the Fuzhou merchants sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai-based shops to immediately suspend trade. Those who had already prepared their goods were ordered to postpone loading, and those who had not yet been shipped were to temporarily store them in Shanghai warehouses. All Fujian merchants in Shanghai have complied with these orders.</p>
<h3>Sharp Reduction in Cargo</h3>
<p>Today's Fuzhou liner is the Jardine Matheson's Jie Sheng, a British ship. The ship had been arranged by the Fujian merchants and had an original export cargo of 4,000 tons. The ship was scheduled to load at noon, but because the Fuzhou merchants sent a telegram to suspend trade, each guest merchant temporarily cancelled their tonnage. Yesterday afternoon, the Jie Sheng's cargo for Fujian was only 250 tons, with temporary cancellations accounting for more than 90%. The Shanghai-Fujian shipping routes have also been severely affected, and it is feared that cargo from Fuzhou to Shanghai will also be suspended in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Reports on the Economic Committee Standing Committee Meeting: Decisions Made on Candidates for Various Department Heads and the Establishment of a Trust, American Cotton and Wheat Loans Have Not Yet Been Used, Song Will Go to Nanjing After Meeting with Two British Experts</h3>
<p>The first Standing Committee meeting of the National Economic Council was held last Saturday morning at the Council's Shanghai office at 1729 Avenue Joffre (today's Huaihai Middle Road). Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke came from Nanjing to attend, and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Industry Minister Chen Gongbo were also invited to attend. Song Ziwen, the Standing Committee member of the Council, reported on the proceedings and resolutions of the meeting at the office at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The report is transcribed as follows: (1) A report was given on the past situation of the American cotton and wheat loans, which have not yet been used, and the allocation plan is currently being discussed. (2) The candidates for the heads of the various departments of the Economic Council were discussed, and decisions were made on (a) Chen Ticheng as the Director of the Roads Department, (b) Chief Engineer Mao temporarily as the Director of the Engineering Department, (c) Cao Lianfang as the Director of the Agriculture Department, and (d) Liu Ruiheng as the Director of the Health Department.

The amount already decided for road expenses is 15 million yuan per year. After the report, Song Ziwen told the Xin Xin News Agency reporter that the former Director of the Financial Department of the League of Nations, Salter, and the British economist Macleod, at the invitation of the Economic Committee, have come to China together on the Changxing Company's Empress of Russia and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this Tuesday (today). The two are well-known British economic experts, and I (Song) will depart for Nanjing to plan the affairs of the Economic Committee after meeting with them in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Summoned Meierle Yesterday for Tax Reform Matters</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi summoned Meierle, the Inspector General of Customs, at his residence on Avenue West Ames (today's Xinle Road) at 9:30 yesterday morning. They discussed tax matters for 40 minutes, and detailed instructions were given.

<h3>Egyptian Consul in Japan Comes to China to Investigate Commerce, Plans to Establish a Commercial Visiting Organization in China to Promote Commercial Development Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>M. Fauzy, the Egyptian Consul in Japan, has recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan and is temporarily staying at the Metropole Hotel on Jiangxi Road. He visited Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, yesterday. According to him, his mission in China is to investigate the commercial situation of China and to establish a special commercial visiting bureau in China to promote the development of trade between the two countries. He also said that Egypt's imports from China require a lot of silk fabrics and tobacco leaves, and its exports to China are mainly cotton. This visit to China also hopes to contact Chinese cotton yarn factories and make short-term visits and investigations in major commercial ports in China. He asked the bureau to introduce him to these, and the bureau has already sent letters of introduction to the Chambers of Commerce and Commodity Inspection Bureaus of Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and Nanjing to provide him with guidance and all conveniences in the investigation. The letter is recorded as follows: I am writing to inform you that M. Fauzy, the Egyptian Consul in Japan, has come to various ports in China to investigate the silk fabric and tobacco leaf market and plans to establish a commercial visiting organization in China to promote the development of commerce between the two countries and various inquiries. He is coming to your area for investigation and a short sightseeing trip. I am writing to introduce him and ask you to provide him with guidance and all conveniences in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Between China Merchants Bureau and Longhai Railway Implemented Yesterday, Tonghua Ship Returns to Shanghai Today, Longhai Railway Has a Lot of Goods</h3>
<p>Joint water and land transportation between the state-owned China Merchants Bureau and the Longhai Railway was implemented yesterday. The Tonghua ship, which was sent by the Bureau to Haizhou to load Longhai Railway's joint transport goods, left Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon, it could reach the railway dock at Laoyao Sunjiashan. The ship was empty when it sailed to Haizhou because there was no cargo to be transported. It was sent specifically to load cargo from various stations on the Longhai Railway to Shanghai, and it is expected to depart today. It is said that the Longhai Railway transports about 200,000 tons of goods to the sea every year, mainly peanuts, cotton, and other local products, while imported foreign goods are only a small amount of daily necessities.</p>
<h3>Liu Hongsheng Reports That China Merchants Bureau's Future is Optimistic, Economic Committee Decides to Allocate Huge Sums of Money, Old HSBC Debts to be Paid Off First, Joint Transport is Willing to Cooperate with Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau urgently needs to deal with maturing foreign debts, so it has submitted a request to the Central Government to allocate 15 million yuan first to meet the emergency. Also, signing a joint water and land transportation agreement with the Ministry of Railways has aroused opposition from private companies, accusing the China Merchants Bureau of monopolizing shipping operations. Yesterday, the Bureau held a commemorative week, and General Manager Liu Hongsheng personally attended and reported that a huge sum of 15 million yuan has been raised. He also detailed the addition of new ships, the repair of various wharves, and the implementation of joint transportation, and expressed willingness to cooperate with civil aviation to jointly deal with foreign ships that infringe on our shipping rights. The details are very important, and a summary is given below:</p>
<h3>Total Debt</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Bureau's commemorative week was announced the day before by Liu Hongsheng to the General Affairs Section, conveying to all employees in the Bureau that they should gather at the Bureau on Monday morning to listen to General Manager Liu Hongsheng's report on important recent matters within the Bureau. Therefore, all employees arrived early yesterday morning. After Liu arrived at the auditorium and held the usual ceremony, Liu announced that there were three major items to report today: raising money to repay debts, building new ships, repairing docks, and handling joint transportation. Liu said that the China Merchants Bureau's various foreign debts, including interest, amount to about 22 million yuan to date, and all debts have matured. In fact, it is very difficult to delay any longer and must be raised and repaid in a short period of time. This is indeed the biggest problem facing the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Huge Sum Raised</h3>
<p>The Bureau's operations this year, whether in the Yangtze River or near-sea transportation, have improved compared to the past few years, and the income of each shipping route has also increased. In this situation, the future of operations is very promising, which is also gratifying. However, the most important thing is the foreign debt, and the most urgent thing to repay first is the 10 million yuan from HSBC. The Bureau has already submitted a request to the Ministry, asking the Central Government to allocate 15 million yuan of the Bureau's fund first. The case has been approved by the Central Government and handed over to the Economic Committee for allocation. The Committee raised this case for discussion at a meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday and approved it, granting the Bureau 15 million yuan as a fund in a short period of time. Any difficult problem can be solved once the fund is received.</p>
<h3>Using Gengkuan Funds</h3>
<p>The Bureau currently has more than 20 ships, most of which are old and not suitable for current navigation. Therefore, if we want to develop the shipping industry, we must first add new ships to meet the needs of each route. The Bureau has borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to build seven new river and sea ships, which have already begun. They can be put into service by the summer and autumn of next year. With the addition of these seven new ships, operations can be developed. We will continue to plan to add more ships in the future. However, the Bureau's docks occupy the most advantageous position in Shanghai, but they have been damaged for many years and must be thoroughly repaired. We are now planning in a comprehensive way, and as soon as the Economic Committee's 15 million yuan is allocated, we can start construction.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Bureau's signing of a national water and land joint transportation contract with the Ministry of Railways this time, with the Longhai Railway being the first to be implemented, has been criticized by outsiders who are unaware of the situation, saying that the Bureau is monopolizing transportation, causing misunderstandings among civil aviation companies. In fact, the Bureau's fundamental truth in creating joint transportation lies in resisting foreign ships that infringe on our shipping rights. The Bureau's position is absolutely consistent with the idea of uniting with and cooperating with our national private shipping companies. There is absolutely no intention of having the China Merchants Bureau monopolize the business of each route. For example, the transportation business in the Qinghai line is mostly taken away by a certain country's ships. Without the Bureau's joint transportation, how can it be recovered? Therefore, we sincerely hope that the private shipping companies will understand the Bureau's truth, eliminate anger, and quickly cooperate. The China Merchants Bureau is very willing to sincerely negotiate in order to recover lost shipping rights, which is not only beneficial to the country but also an honor for the shipping merchants.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arima Arrives in Shanghai Last Night, Expected to Return to His Country for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Arima Akira, the Japanese Ambassador to China, left for Beiping with his wife and Counselor Suma, Chinese Counselor Arino, and Secretary Sakikawa last month to handle Sino-Japanese negotiations in North China and other matters. He left Beiping with his wife and others the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai express train at 11:55 last night. He returned to his residence to rest. It is said that the ambassador will leave Shanghai for his country for two weeks after a short rest. However, the exact date has not yet been determined and depends on the orders of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Famous French Aviator Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the famous French aviator de Scheppele has been flying for nearly 18 years without ever experiencing an accident. He is coming to China from Europe and will arrive in Shanghai today (the 20th) or tomorrow (the 21st). De Scheppele is flying a Havilland Dragon Rapide, which is the same model as the one flown by the British aviator Mr. and Mrs. Mollison. Its cruising speed is 108 miles per hour, and its maximum speed is 130 miles per hour. It uses two Gipsy Major engines, each with 130 horsepower, mounted on the lower wing, with air-cooled engines on both sides of the fuselage. It has had several long-distance flights and has excellent performance and is particularly fuel-efficient. The plane has two fuel tanks, each with 30 gallons, and can travel 550 miles in no wind.

<h3>Shanghai Money Shops Subscribed to the Ministry of Finance's New Loan and Paid to the Joint Reserve Treasury Yesterday, Total Amount Received Has Reached More Than 970,000 Yuan, The Deficit Will Be Covered by the Reserve Treasury</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi urgently needed military expenses for bandit suppression, so he mortgaged 5 million yuan of the 22-year customs treasury bills to Shanghai money shops for a cash loan of 2.5 million yuan. The Shanghai Money Shops Association held an extraordinary general meeting on the 16th of this month and resolved to subscribe to 1 million yuan, with each money shop subscribing to 15,000 yuan. Yesterday (the 20th), all money shops paid the money in full. The Money Shops Joint Reserve Treasury can distribute and send the treasury bills once they are received. Yesterday's report on Qin Runqing's remarks was completely untrue. The Shanghai Money Shops Association was deeply surprised. The information obtained by the Dagong News Agency reporter from the Shanghai Money Shops Association yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Loan Facts</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao newspaper made a special trip yesterday morning to the Shanghai Money Trade Association to inquire about the truth of the Ministry of Finance's loan incident. According to the person in charge of the Association, the Ministry of Finance used twenty-second year customs treasury bonds with a face value of 5 million yuan to borrow 2.5 million yuan in cash from the industry. The Association convened a special meeting of member representatives on the 16th of this month and decided to borrow 1 million yuan. The method was that each member money shop would borrow 15,000 yuan. However, members with insufficient financial resources or smaller scale could reduce the amount as appropriate. The shortfall would be covered by the money industry reserve. A notice was issued by the Association on the 17th of this month, requiring all money shops to pay the money by the 20th of this month (yesterday). However, today's newspapers carried a news report from a certain news agency, saying that Qin Runqing denied the loan, which is very surprising. The news reported by the agency is not the truth. Mr. Qin Runqing, as the chairman of the Association, would never make such a statement. Otherwise, the reporter must have misunderstood. The fact that the Ministry of Finance has established a new loan of 1 million yuan with the money industry is indeed true. As for the previous loan, it has already passed. The two matters are completely different and cannot be confused, and so on.</p>
<h3>Association Notice</h3>
<p>The Money Trade Association issued a notice on the 17th of this month, which reads: Respectfully inform you that the Ministry of Finance has instructed that 22nd year customs treasury bonds with a face value of 5 million yuan will be used to borrow 2.5 million yuan in cash from our industry. A meeting of member representatives was convened on the 16th of this month to discuss this matter. It was generally agreed that it is difficult to comply with the order given the current commercial depression, and that there is no surplus capacity to cope with the previous loan, which is only a few days away. After repeated discussions, it was decided that it is necessary to exhaust the meager strength because the matter concerns the national treasury and funds are urgently needed for Minister Kong's new appointment. A consensus was reached to raise 1 million yuan, with each bank in the Association borrowing 15,000 yuan. On the 20th of this month, please send the funds directly to the industry reserve, obtain a receipt, and submit it for collection. After the treasury bonds are received, the reserve will distribute them to each bank according to the amount, and return the receipt to clear the procedures. This special notice is hereby recorded and issued, please take note and handle it accordingly. Addressed to ×× Precious Bank, Shanghai Money Trade Association, November 17th, 22nd year.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Payment</h3>
<p>According to a Ta Kung Pao reporter's inquiry to the Money Trade Association yesterday, each money shop paid the new loan to the Ministry of Finance to the Joint Reserve of Money Shops yesterday, and obtained a receipt. A total of 67 money shops in the city contributed to the loan, reaching more than 970,000 yuan. The shortfall of just over 20,000 yuan will be covered by the money industry reserve. As for the treasury bonds, they will be received within four or five days after the loan is collected and submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The reserve will then distribute them to each money shop according to the amount.</p>
<h3>Electricity Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>All Workers Resume Work Tomorrow Morning</p>

<h3>Negotiated Resolution</h3>
<p>After Mr. Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and Mr. Du Yuesheng, a municipal councilor, formally conducted mediation with the company, the two parties reached a general agreement on the resolution method after several consultations. Yesterday, Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou, etc., met again at the Bankers' Association and made a decision. Yesterday morning, Mr. Du and Mr. Yuan conducted final negotiations with the company and reached a resolution: (1) Persuade the workers to resume work first; (2) After the workers resume work, all wages before the strike will be paid in full as before; (3) The company will pay one month's wages for the strike period (if the company refuses to pay the wages, Mr. Du and the Chinese directors will be responsible for the payment). The remaining conditions raised by the workers will be negotiated with the company by Mr. Du and the Chinese directors after the resumption of work. Therefore, the strike has been temporarily resolved.</p>
<h3>Resume Work Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The 4th District Water and Electricity Industry Union believes that the electricity strike has been resolved through the good-faith mediation of Mr. Fei and Mr. Du. Although the resolution method has not satisfied the workers, they have expressed their willingness to accept it in order to respect the advice of the leaders and to take into consideration the public safety of the area. The union has convened an emergency meeting and decided that the workers of both the old and new factories will resume work tomorrow morning (the 22nd).</p>

He has now completed his mission and left Fiji to return to Hong Kong at the beginning of this month. After a short stay, he took a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The reporter made a special trip to the Flying Transport Company to inquire, but because Mr. Bixby had been away from Shanghai for a long time and was very busy dealing with official business, he scheduled another time to talk to the reporter in detail about the negotiation process. However, according to people in the company, the negotiations on the route have been roughly completed.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia Leave Shanghai for Fujian Today</h3>
<p>Li Shuanghui, Li Tiemin, He Baoren, Huang Xiaoyan, Liu Weiming and other representatives of overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia returned to China from Singapore this time to inspect the political, economic, educational, and social conditions of various parts of Fujian. When they arrived in Fuzhou, they learned that the chairman of the province, Jiang Guangnai, had gone to Hong Kong and did not meet him. They immediately came to Shanghai and went to Beijing to visit the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang. They have now completed their official business and returned to Shanghai. According to Li, who spoke to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter yesterday, his colleagues are scheduled to take the Jardine Matheson's Jiesheng ship to Fujian from Shanghai on the 21st (today). Their itinerary will first go to Fuzhou and Xiamen, and then to Hong Kong. If there is enough time, they may go to Guangzhou again before returning to Singapore. It is found that there are about 2 million Chinese living on the Malay Peninsula. Most of them are engaged in rubber and tin. Their only sales outlet is the United States, but in recent years, due to the impact of the world economic recession, business has been declining. In addition, after his colleagues arrive in Fuzhou, they will meet with the authorities in a private capacity to discuss the issue of changing the political landscape in Fujian Province. At a time when foreign aggression and domestic worries are intertwined, they hope that all parties will unite in good faith to resist foreign aggression.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Installs Underwater Trans-River Trunk Line This Morning; The Installation of New Machines in Pudong Will Begin at the Beginning of Next Month; 13 Additional Round-Trip Trunk Lines Will be Added to Longhua</h3>
<p>The Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is about to be established. The laying of new trunk lines and the installation of telephone machines will begin next month. The bureau will also lay two new underwater trans-river lines at the Bund of Fuzhou Road and Gaochang Temple starting this morning, and add 13 round-trip lines to Longhua. The details are as follows according to the Ta Kung Pao reporter:</p>
<h3>Installing New Machines in Pudong</h3>
<p>The site of the Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau is expected to be completed in its entirety within the month. It is scheduled to begin installing 800 door telephone machines at the beginning of next month. The new trunk lines will also be laid according to the routes designated by the Public Works Bureau. It is estimated that there are more than 80 telephones installed in Pudong by the concession telephone company after crossing the boundary. After the Shanghai Telephone Bureau notified the users, more than 40 Bada companies requested to be dismantled and installed in the past few days.</p>
<h3>Laying Trans-River Water Lines</h3>
<p>Since the formal signing of the temporary contract for the trans-river water line of the Concession Telephone Company directly expanded to Pudong, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has negotiated with the company to buy it at a price in order to initially recover the sovereignty of the telecommunications administration. It will also set up 75 pairs of trans-river water lines from the Bund of Fuzhou Road to Lan Ni Du in Pudong to connect to the Concession Telephone Company. Fifty pairs of trans-river lines from Gaochang Temple to Zhoujiadu in Pudong will be connected to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. Both lines are scheduled to be installed starting this morning. The old water line on the Bund of Nanjing Road will be dismantled after the new line is installed and completed.</p>
<h3>Adding Round-Trip Lines to Longhua</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau directly connected to Longhua has a total of seven pairs of telephone lines. Because factories, shops, and residences in Xiangjiazhai, Xiaomuqiao, Rihuigang, Fenglinqiao, and other places in Longhua are gradually increasing, the original telephone lines are not enough to allocate. Therefore, 13 additional round-trip lines will be added. Starting from the Telephone Bureau, they will be placed along Lujiabang Road, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Xietu Road, and released to Longhua.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Huge Sum of Money on Huasheng Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang, an employee of the Xiexing Minji Military Uniform Factory in Baoqing Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei, obtained 6,000 yuan in silver notes from the Xintai Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession yesterday morning. He took it back to the military uniform factory's office on Minguo Road, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, and left 1,500 yuan in foreign currency. The remaining 4,500 yuan was taken by Liang Youfang, a factory employee, to Zhabei to distribute part of the wages to female workers. At that time, it was 12:00 noon, and hundreds of female workers were gathered in front of the patio waiting. Liang handed the banknotes to Ma Zhonglian, the accounting room clerk, and Zhang Chungui, an eye clerk, for distribution. Unexpectedly, five robbers suddenly came. Three robbers were wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, one robber was wearing yellow short clothes, and the other robber was wearing black long clothes. They held guns and guarded the patio entrance, not allowing the workers to go out. The three robbers wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants were also holding pistols, threatening and forbidding them to make noise. A robber in yellow clothes put all the remaining banknotes and silver coins into a lead-skinned iron bucket and left. Before leaving, the robbers re-locked the iron ring on the patio door with lead wire and fled. After checking, 880 yuan of wages had been paid out. The silver notes and coins worth 3,620 yuan were robbed. When the police officers of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau arrived, the robbers had disappeared. Therefore, none of them were captured. However, when the female workers learned that their wages had been robbed, they were afraid that the factory would stop paying their wages, so they gathered and refused to leave. Later, the factory sent someone to the Concession to get some cash and distributed it as usual, and the people's hearts were settled. It is learned that the robbers first destroyed the telephone during the robbery, so it was impossible to report it for a while. The robbers were able to escape the law.</p>
<h3>Robbers Break into House and Injure People on Hanzhong Road; One Robber Captured on the Spot</h3>
<p>Zhao Guirong, a native of Jiangbei, is 39 years old and lives at No. 7 Dafu Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei. His neighbor is Yin Hengcai, a fellow villager who sells yellow sand and stones for a living. He is diligent and thrifty, so his family has a small amount of assets, which attracted the attention of robbers. At about 6:15 last night, three robbers suddenly used hammers to break through the door and broke into the house. They took out their guns and intimidated them, and searched arbitrarily. The jewelry, clothing, and other items were robbed, the number of which cannot be estimated. After more than ten minutes, the robbers shouted and entered. When the robbers were about to leave, one of the robbers at the back was acting skillfully, but was caught by Zhao Guirong and held down. The robber struggled unsuccessfully, so he fired several shots, hitting Zhao Guirong three times: one shot in the right thigh, one in the left breast, the bullet pierced the left thigh, and one shot remained in the abdomen. Blood was flowing non-stop, and he fainted to the ground. At that time, it was dusk, and neighbors gathered and blew whistles wildly. The police officers nearby immediately arrested a robber on the spot and escorted him to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. The injured person was ordered by the police to be rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. According to him, Zhao's large intestine had been cut off, and his life was in danger.</p>

<h3>Bomb Excavated in Xiaohama, Tanziwan, Injured Four Workers; Feared to be Left Over From Last Year's War; Two Workers in Danger of Death</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 yesterday morning, four workers were digging mud in a small river near the wasteland behind the Dafeng Yarn Factory in Tanziwan, Zhabei. Unexpectedly, there was a bomb at the bottom of the river. At that time, the workers did not know what the bomb was. They thought that there might be something hidden in the middle, so they picked up the bomb and placed it on the shore. They used an iron bar to open it. Before the bar had hit it a few times, the bomb was vibrated and suddenly exploded with a loud bang. The pieces of metal flew in all directions. The four workers around the bomb were injured and fell to the ground at the same time. Fortunately, the chief police officers of the Third Division of the Fourth District Police Station heard the sound and rushed to the scene. They immediately notified the Zhabei Fire Brigade to rush to send an ambulance and fly four people to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Pan Ahua, a native of Jiangbei, 19 years old, was injured in the head and limbs, and Liu Changfu, a native of Jiangbei, 35 years old, was injured all over his body and buttocks. It is feared that they are in danger of death. There are also Zhang Daogang, a native of Taizhou, 26 years old, and Xia Yifu, a native of Nanjing, 39 years old, who were injured in both hands and legs, and the situation is still light. After the incident, it was found that the bomb explosion had formed a large hole, and the power of the explosion can be imagined. As for the source of the bomb, it is thought that it was abandoned in the river during the war last year.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Western Shipping Merchants in Pudong Request the Municipal Government to Dredge the Shallow Beach in Pudong</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of Western shipping merchants in Pudong, submitted a request to the Municipal Government yesterday to dredge the shallow beach along the Pudong south of Dongjiadu Pier in order to facilitate transportation. The document reads: "The petition is to request the dredging of the shallow beach along the Pudong south of Pier 16 in order to maintain shipping and emphasize commercial affairs in the city. Now, the piers along the Pudong are occupied and the river is narrow, resulting in turbulent tides, making driving difficult. Accidents occur from time to time. Recently, the docks have been frequently silted up, and it has been reported to the government for dredging. It is heard that it will only reach Pier 16. Now, from Pier 16 south to Dongjiadu to the area of the South Pier, the Pudong beach is occupied by bamboo rafts and other obstacles, resulting in the accumulation of silt, which is even worse than the pier. Not only can merchant ships not dock, but merchants' goods also have no way to load and unload, which affects commerce and endangers traffic. The importance of ports and road administration is equal. Now, Gongyi Pier, Dongjiadu, and the South Guild Hall Pier are the most popular areas for boats from the four townships to dock and are the commercial center of the southern city. Now that it is planned to dredge to Pier 16, and the shipping pier adjacent to Dongjiadu Pier is close at hand.

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Requests Ban on Screening of Anti-War Films</h3>
<p>Due to the prevalence of anti-war content in films shown in various cinemas in Shanghai, which has a significant negative impact on our nation's efforts to avenge its grievances and wipe out its humiliation, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters recently submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, requesting that it consult with the National Government and instruct the Ministry of Interior to prohibit such films. The original text of the petition is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"Petition regarding a request: Upon investigation, many films shown in cinemas in this city contain anti-war themes. For example, the recently released 'War and Peace' depicts the cruelty of war, the sorrow of families being torn apart, the suffering of wounded soldiers, the aimless existence of officers after the war, the sadness and pity of disabled veterans, and the desolate and tragic scenes of soldiers' graves, etc., which are enough to make viewers feel chilled and frightened. Although its intention may be to call for peace, in this time of serious national crisis for the Chinese nation, if the public's thoughts are immersed in such images, then the vow to 'endure hardship and avenge national humiliation' will become mere after-dinner banter. The impact on the nation's destiny will be profound and immense. This committee, considering the difficulties of the times, cannot bear to remain silent and therefore submits this document to your esteemed council. We respectfully request your council to review and approve this matter, consult with the National Government, and order the Ministry of Interior to prohibit the screening of such films within the country, and instruct the Film Censorship Committee to pay strict attention. This is for the public good."</p>
<h3>Chinese Woman Traveling to Japan Expelled by Japanese Police and Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>A man named Wu Caogen from Yangjing Town, Pudong, was invited to work at the Eiki Gofukuten Kimono Shop in Kawaramachi, Kyoto, Japan. When he departed from Shanghai, he brought a woman named Wu (23 years old) with him to Japan, intending for her to work as a maid in a Chinese merchant's house in Yokohama. They had already boarded a ship to Japan. However, when the ship arrived in Kobe, Wu Caogen was detained by the Japanese water police and not allowed to enter the country. Despite Wu's statement that he had an employer, it was to no avail. The woman Wu, who went with him, was also prohibited from landing in Yokohama. Later, when the Chinese merchant who hired her arrived to vouch for her, the Japanese police still refused to allow it. Consequently, Ms. Wu and Wu Caogen, along with three other Chinese people, Mr. Weng, Mr. Zhu, etc., were all detained at the police station and escorted back to Shanghai yesterday on the Asosan Maru. This is the first instance of Japanese people rejecting Chinese women from entering the country and even insulting them. Yesterday, Ms. Wu and the others arrived in Shanghai and have already returned to their hometown of Yangjing Town.</p>

Therefore, when the members of the Flood Relief Committee contacted them, the circus immediately agreed, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>The circus will leave Shanghai for India in two weeks. Those who have not yet seen it or wish to see it again should go as soon as possible to feast their eyes. The circus will stop performing at the end of this month to prepare for its trip. It is said that the recent performances have been the most spectacular ever seen, and the menagerie contains many rare and exotic animals. To date, over ten thousand people have visited. One more thing to inform the audience is that the circus will light many large stoves before the show to make the air inside the tent warmer. These stoves will be removed before the curtain rises.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association for the Yellow River Flood, consisting of Xu Shiying, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, etc., requested the Haikyong Performer's Circus to perform a charity show today (the 21st).

Mr. Xu Shiying delivered a speech of thanks, saying: "This year, the Yellow River has flooded, the levees have breached, and the provinces along the river have suffered severe flooding. The most heavily affected areas cover approximately 15,600 square li, and the number of affected people is approximately 2.9 million. Currently, the disaster victims in various places are without clothes, food, or shelter, crying out for help, truly a hell on earth. Our association is handling emergency relief for Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces, and it is a critical time. Today, Mr. Haikyong, the German circus performer, with a spirit of universal love, is helping disaster victims and caring for neighbors, and has put on special new performances to raise funds for relief. We are also grateful to the Chinese and foreign gentlemen and ladies who have come to watch and are enthusiastic about the relief effort. I am immensely grateful. On behalf of the members of this association and the disaster-stricken compatriots, I express my thanks and will broadcast a thank you message on the Greater China Radio Station tomorrow."</p>
<h3>The Suspected Mastermind of the Murder of the "Taiji King" in Nanchang Apprehended in Shanghai - A Letter from Wu Zuyin Discovered During Inspection of Postal and Telegraph Services - Deemed Highly Suspicious and Personnel Sent to Shanghai to Arrest Him - Complex Inside Story, Motivated by Adultery</h3>
<p>Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, has a well-known lewd woman named Zhang Tan, who specializes in seducing the daughters of prominent families and the wives and concubines of wealthy gentry in the local area to secretly engage in prostitution. The people of Nanchang have bestowed upon her the lofty title of "Taiji King." Those who frequent her house for pleasure are all military and political figures, prominent gentry, and wealthy merchants. Therefore, the Taiji King's power is immense, and people on the streets are wary of her. Local officials are well aware that she is the ringleader in corrupting public morals, but due to various concerns, they are unwilling to bring her to justice, which has only made the Taiji King more reckless. On the night of the 10th of this month, several members of a certain "Exterminate the Traitor" group suddenly rushed into the Taiji King's residence at No. 10 Baojia Lane. At that time, several young women who had been seduced were enjoying themselves with their patrons, while the Taiji King was alone in the Buddhist hall,</p>
<h3>Chanting Sutras and Tapping a Wooden Fish</h3>
<p>When reciting the Buddhist scriptures, the group members immediately divided into groups to work. They locked the shameless men and women in a room, cut the electrical wires in the house, and removed the light bulbs. Then, in the darkness, they stabbed Zhang Tan, the notorious troublemaker who shook Jiangxi, to death in front of the Buddhist altar. Before leaving, the murderers left behind numerous printed materials, including a letter to the people of Jiangxi and a list of Zhang Tan's crimes with prominent red seals inside the house. Later, the maid of the house, after the group had left for a long time, dared to come out to get a light and illuminate the house. This tragic scene was then exposed, and she immediately reported it to the local Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to investigate and found a sharp blade beside the corpse. The next day, it was reported to the local court, which appointed a prosecutor to the scene to examine the body and order its burial. The highest military and police authorities in the area believed that such an assassination case had occurred in the capital of the province, and that the perpetrators dared to issue a declaration afterward, showing extreme disregard for the law. In addition to ordering a thorough investigation of the murderers, they also ordered the postal and telegraph offices to implement postal and telegraph inspections from that day onward. As a result of the inspection, a letter from Wu Zuyin of Jiangxi to a certain father-in-law, Mr. Qi, in Shanghai was discovered,</p>
<h3>Deemed Highly Suspicious of the Tragedy</h3>
<p>Therefore, Zhang Shouchun, the director of the Public Security Branch, was dispatched to Shanghai to track him down. After learning that Wu was residing at Room 226, Yangtze Hotel, Yunnan Road, Director Zhang went to the Zhabei Police Station the night before last at 9:30 PM and requested that Detective He Lianzhen be dispatched to the address to arrest Wu. It was found that Wu was one of the wealthy gentry of Nanchang and had a family there. In the past, Wu was also a guest in Zhang Tan's "Taiji" inner circle. Later, through her introduction, he met a woman named Qi Yiqing, the daughter of Mr. Qi. Initially, they only had a fleeting relationship, but later, due to their mutual affection, he took her as a concubine and hid her in No. 4 Hedemiao. Yiqing is now only in her early twenties. After becoming Wu's concubine, she still could not forget the "Taiji" lifestyle. In addition, Zhang Tan was good at seduction, so she often secretly went to Baojia Lane behind Wu's back to</p>
<h3>Try the Flavor of Extramarital Affairs</h3>
<p>Over time, the matter was heard by Wu. He was reluctant to abandon her, so he sent Yiqing to her parents' house at No. 31 Fulu Nunnery, so that she would be far away from the den of iniquity and could be disciplined by her parents, hoping she would wake up. However, Yiqing was fickle by nature and could not change her ways after all. Wu then moved her to a silver shop on Zhongshan Road, but the red apricot still climbed over the wall, and he was destined to wear the green hat forever. Wu could not help but resent the Taiji King and wanted to recruit warriors to kill her to eliminate the potential troubles at home. He learned of Wang Gao, who was a vagrant. He conspired with him and promised a large sum of money if he succeeded. Wang readily agreed. However, Wang had committed a serious crime during the warlord era and was arrested by the authorities, sentenced to death, and imprisoned awaiting execution. Between 1926 and 1927, the warlord regime collapsed, and the situation in Jiangxi changed. Zhang Tan's prominence was rising, and Wang was pardoned and released with her help. He was grateful for the life-saving grace, but had no time to repay her.</p>
<h3>He was Willing to Put Her to Death</h3>
<p>Therefore, after Wu asked him, he told her about it. Li Shanji, the most reputable lawyer in Nanchang, also frequented the "Taiji" on weekdays and had a close relationship with Zhang Tan. Zhang Tan once relayed what Wang had said to Li and asked for advice on preventive measures. Li replied that it was impossible to verify whether Wang's words were credible or whether Wu actually had such a plan, and advised the Taiji King to be tolerant or even avoid him. Therefore, although the Taiji King and Wu each had their own pain, they never openly confronted each other. It was Lawyer Li's words that resolved the dispute. Recently, the Taiji King received various anonymous letters, all with threatening words, and was very worried. Two days before she was killed, she even</p>
<h3>Consulted a Fortune Teller About Good and Bad Omens</h3>
<p>According to the fortune teller, she was about to have an unexpected disaster and should protect herself quickly. Therefore, she planned to relocate to avoid it, but she was just starting to arrange the move when it was too late. After the incident, the military law department of the headquarters investigated the matter and summoned Wang Gao. Under interrogation, it was confirmed that Wu was indeed a suspect. Coincidentally, a letter from Wu sent from Shanghai was discovered, so Director Zhang was immediately dispatched to Shanghai to arrest him. As for Wu, he left Jiangxi three days (the 7th) before the tragedy occurred, took a plane to Shanghai on the 8th, and first stayed at Room 614, Nanjing Hotel, under the alias Liu Zilin. On the 9th, he moved to Yipinxiang, first staying in Room 61, and then switching to Room 62 on the 10th. It wasn't until the 11th that he</p>
<h3>Arrived at the Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>He opened Room 401, stayed for three nights, and then switched to Room 229. His movements were extremely suspicious. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian interrogated him. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the details of the arrest. Because Nanchang requested extradition, he should provide concrete evidence. Wu hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping to apply for bail. Judge Qian questioned Wu, who flatly denied murdering Zhang Tan. The court stated that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered Wu to be detained for a seven-day extension for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman Sacrifices Herself at a Flower Gambling Session - Chen Suzhen Hangs Herself in Despair</h3>
<p>Jiang Songshan, 39 years old, a native of Jiangdu, is a partner at the Nianhe Seafood Store on Xinkaihe Road in the Chinese Concession of Nanshi. He lives at No. 6 Jinshan Lane, Anping Street, inside the old North Gate. He married a woman surnamed Chen from his hometown in his early years. She is now 36 years old and has a daughter named Guiying, who is 14 years old. Unexpectedly, in the spring of this year, Jiang suddenly became acquainted with a woman named Chen Suzhen from Suzhou. Unexpectedly, Suzhen had a gambling addiction, especially for flower gambling. As a result, all of her clothes and jewelry were pawned. Although Jiang hated it, because Suzhen was already pregnant, he had no choice but to move Suzhen to Jinshan Lane to live with his legal wife, hoping that someone would watch over her. However, yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, while Jiang and his legal wife were sound asleep, they suddenly heard a loud noise in Suzhen's bedroom. Knowing that something was wrong, they quickly put on their clothes and checked, only to see that Suzhen had hanged herself. Although they tried to take her down, it was too late, and she was beyond saving. They immediately reported it to the Second Precinct of the First District and ordered the neighborhood head to report it to the local court for examination.</p>
<h3>Zhong Yunliang Mistakenly Beaten and Killed - Body Examined</h3>
<p>Zhong Yunliang, 32 years old, from Suzhou, resided at No. 94 Yongchang Lane, Dongyouheng Road. He worked at the Dingfeng Silk Factory on Xiangyanqiao Road in Zhabei. Around 10:00 PM on the 17th of this month, Zhong and his companion, Shen Xingsen, finished work at the factory and were returning home. Unexpectedly, as soon as they walked out of the factory gate together, several men were waiting there, holding iron bars, intending to beat Shen. Seeing this, Zhong immediately stepped forward to dissuade them, and was severely beaten in the abdomen. Shen, seeing that things were not good, immediately hid and avoided the disaster. Zhong returned home with injuries, and the wound became increasingly painful. Later, his roommate, Xu Fenggang, took him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Yang Xichen to investigate. It was learned that the number of men who committed the crime had previously worked at the Dingfeng Silk Factory, but for some reason, they were suddenly laid off by the factory. They suspected that Shen was responsible, leading to a feud. Therefore, they ambushed there that night, intending to retaliate. Unexpectedly, they mistakenly beat Zhong. The detective then carried the body to the Philan Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court came to the morgue to examine the body. After examining the body, he learned from Shen Xingsen that the deceased Zhong Yunliang, male, had indeed died from an abdominal injury sustained during his life. The body was handed over to Shen Xingsen, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial. It is now known that the incident occurred in the Chinese Concession, and the responsible Public Security Bureau is currently engaged in arresting the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Dong Zhixin Accused of Selling Counterfeit Goods, Fined 300 Yuan by Court</h3>
<p>Dong Zhixin, the unscrupulous owner of Dexingxiang Department Store at No. 5, Lane 1, Yela Street, French Concession, has recently been selling inferior goods. The triangular-branded women's gloves he sells have trademarks and patterns identical to the Baoshi brand gloves registered by the Zhongnan Factory at No. 228, Ladu Road. The Zhongnan Factory discovered this and accused Dong of profiting from trademark infringement, which hinders the promotion of domestic goods and is intolerable. Therefore, they immediately reported it to the police. Detectives were dispatched to Dexingxiang, where a dozen pairs of counterfeit gloves and a ledger of alteration fees were seized, and Dong was arrested and brought to the Second Special District Court. He was publicly prosecuted for harming agriculture, industry, and commerce. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan-ying of the Eighth Criminal Court ruled that Dong Zhixin knowingly sold goods with counterfeit trademarks and fined him 300 yuan. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be imprisoned at a rate of 2 yuan per day. Before the judgment is finalized, the number of days of detention will be used to offset the fine at a rate of 2 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>News from Various Hometown Associations</h3>
<p>Dinghai Jintang: Jintang is an isolated island, not connected to the mainland. However, the island is rich in produce, and the people are simple and honest, making it the best of the Dinghai islands.

<h3>Guo Youshou Inspects Shandong Province's Education and Criticizes It</h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Shandong education was completely destroyed by Zhang Zongchang. It was only after the success of the Northern Expedition that the work of reorganization began. Over the years, there has been considerable progress. The Ministry of Education specially appointed Guo Youshou to come to Shandong for inspection. The Department of Education sent the second section chief Lai Zhizhong to accompany him to various places in southern, northern, and eastern Shandong. After more than a month of detailed inspection, he finally arrived in Qingdao and returned to Jinan today (the 18th). After returning from studying abroad, Guo was sent by the Ministry of Education to countries such as Soviet Russia and Denmark for inspection. He has extensive knowledge. His observations and criticisms of the education in this province after a long period of inspection are very important. The reporter specially visited him today to ask about everything. The following is a record of what Mr. Guo said.</p>
<p>▲ General Criticism: Guo said: "I have been sent by the Ministry to inspect education in Shandong for more than a month. The places I have visited include Jinan City, Tai'an, Qufu, Yanzhou, Jining, Qihe, Pingyuan, Dexian, Zhangqiu, Zouping, Changshan, Qingzhou, Weixian, Huangxian, Yantai, Qingdao, etc. The schools I have inspected include provincial normal schools, middle schools, vocational schools, local educational administrative organs, county middle schools, elementary schools, normal training schools, vocational supplementary schools, mass education centers, and civilian schools. In general, the zoning plan for normal schools is very good. Regarding provincial normal schools, I inspected the First Normal School, the First Women's Normal School, the Second Normal School, the Fourth Normal School, and the Fourth and Fifth Rural Normal Schools, etc. I inspected high schools, the First Middle School, the First Women's Middle School, the Third Middle School, the Seventh Middle School, the Twelfth Middle School, the Tenth Middle School, and the Eighth Middle School, etc. I inspected private middle schools, including Dezhou Bowei, Yantai Yiwen, Zhifu, Jining Sino-Western, Weixian Guangwen, and Tai'an Cuiying and Yuying. I inspected provincial vocational schools, including the First, Second, and Third Vocational Schools, etc. The Department of Education has predetermined plans for the above three types of schools: normal schools, middle schools, and vocational schools. The locations of the schools are also fairly appropriate and can serve as centers. The principals of the schools are working very hard within the possible scope, and the students are also very diligent and thrifty.</p>
<p>▲ Normal Education: At the Provincial Fourth Rural Normal School, the principal and faculty lead the students in labor, jointly transporting bricks and tiles for construction, which is quite a new phenomenon. Their civilian schools, short-term elementary schools, etc., have all been established. For example, the farm raises chickens, ducks, and cattle, and also keeps bees, preparing to use it as a pilot area for the mass education center. The school has experiments for transforming the countryside (there are textbooks on transforming rural teaching materials). All students and faculty are working in one direction, and it is hoped that other rural normal schools will also strive to go to the countryside. As for county rural normal schools, Qihe is the best. With very little funding, they live in the Confucian Temple, and the houses are also very dilapidated. After rectification, they have made considerable progress, and the teachers and students are very excited. All county-level normal training schools are limited by financial and human resources and have not been able to fully develop.</p>
<p>▲ Vocational Mechanical: The First, Second, and Third Vocational Schools that were inspected all have dyeing and weaving as a common subject. The First Vocational School has machinery as its special feature. Chemistry is not very complete in each school. The First and Third Vocational Schools are expected to develop. The principals of the three schools have studied industry and can realistically seek a way out for the students within their scope, so that the students have the skills to make a living after graduation. However, it is a pity that they cannot be fully developed due to limited funding. It is hoped that dyeing, weaving, leather making, and machinery can be expanded for students to practice. As for vocational supplementary education, it is often nominal.</p>
<p>▲ Secondary Education: The provincial middle schools are working hard to prepare students for further education and are strictly training them. Private middle schools, Bowei, divide students into groups for English, Chinese, and arithmetic training, so that those with talent can make great progress, and those with slightly lower levels can also reach the minimum curriculum standards. There are plans for labor education. Students in the school can repair their own bicycles, which is one example. Zhifu Middle School has impressive school buildings and facilities. Among the county middle schools, Huangxian County Middle School is quite tidy. Principal Zhao Zhurong is working hard to raise funds to expand the facilities.</p>
<p>▲ Compulsory Education: Among the counties inspected for compulsory education, Qihe's method is the most comprehensive, and the rural elementary schools are also very tidy. Two-thirds of the school-age children in the county have the opportunity to study. Qi Fengtu, the fifth section chief of the county, continued the plan of the former section chief Wang Xuxing. The designated school districts are very well arranged. Generally, there is an elementary school every two li. The source of funding is apportioned according to the area of land. The county is not a wealthy area, but it has been able to achieve its current achievements, which is very pleasing. Although this method of apportioning money by the mu is very good, it is a pity that it cannot be used as an example for other counties due to the limitations of the central laws. There are the most civilian schools in Tai'an, reaching more than 60 schools in the county. As for short-term compulsory education, its promotion is not yet widespread.</p>
<p>Inspection Feelings: The feeling of this inspection is that Shandong education is still stable and generally on the right track. It is not easy to have the current achievements. The education section chiefs and supervisors of each county have no separation from the department. However, the common problem of provincial secondary schools is that 80% of the funding is used for salaries, and very little funding is used for other office purchases. There is no funding for adding specimens, instruments, and books. Labor education, woodworking, and metalworking are completely lacking. The teacher clock rate is also not very suitable for the Department regulations. This should be corrected in the afternoon budget. The item of books, instruments, and specimens must account for 20% of the total funding, and the number of staff and workers should be reduced as much as possible. Regarding elementary schools, the problems in each county are inconsistent. There are those with sufficient funding but lack of students, and those with insufficient funding but many students. The lack of teachers is felt in the countryside because the salaries of rural schools are very low, so normal school students are unwilling to go to the countryside. The salaries of rural teachers are as low as three and a half yuan a month. The education bureaus also do not audit the budgets of the schools, which should be strictly regulated. The Department of Education should also increase direct supervision. The curriculum allocation and teaching methods of the complex elementary schools should be improved. Rural women's education is too underdeveloped, and the holidays are irregular. Measures should be taken to make up for the lessons. In the future, the Department of Education should impose restrictions and allocate the service period of normal school graduates to serve in the countryside. The education in Lubei is better because it is more prosperous. For the promotion of compulsory education, each county should be strict and expand it in the shortest possible time. The people of Huangxian are wealthy and mostly engaged in business in the Northeast, so the school should specially let the students understand the situation in the Northeast. The local education funding in the county is too small and mostly relies on private donations. The equipment of the First Elementary School in the Third District of the county is the most complete. The library in the school has more than 30,000 books. All instruments can also be used by the faculty for research. Among the twelve faculty members in the school, seven or eight are voluntary. The school's eleven classes of students only have a funding of more than a thousand yuan. The human body models made by the students are extremely exquisite. The school relies entirely on the operation of the school trustee Zhang Tiqing, which is commendable. This school is rare in the country, and the government should reward it. There are eleven private middle schools in Yantai that have not been registered, and 43 elementary schools, with only six registered. The area is a seaport commercial port with abundant small produce and many group properties, all important. The government should pay special attention.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection Purpose: This mission has two main purposes: (1) Inspect vocational education. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the funding for secondary vocational schools should not be less than 35% of the funding for secondary schools, ordinary middle schools should not be more than 40%, and normal schools should not be less than 20%. Currently, the funding for middle schools in Shandong has exceeded 43%, while the funding for vocational schools only accounts for 9%. The courses in each vocational school are similar, with only three subjects: dyeing, weaving, chemistry, and machinery. The number of vocational schools and subjects should also be increased as needed locally. In Yantai, there should be fruit and horticulture; in Boshan, there should be porcelain and glass; in Weixian, there should be dyeing, weaving, and machinery; and in Linqing, there should be agriculture, all of which should be established to meet the standards of the Ministry. Short-term vocational training should be provided in various fields, such as farming, industry, and weaving, such as dyeing and weaving, shop assistants, hairdressers, waiters, and ironworkers, and should be given short-term scientific training. There are too many county middle schools in each place, and they should be converted into vocational schools, because middle schools are too empty and can only prepare for further education. Society must make everyone value vocational education. Like the schools in Soviet Russia, they are all industrialized. The local funding in each county should give priority to the development of compulsory education, not the development of middle schools. Shandong's normal education is well-developed, and the Department of Education should have an overall statistic. The Department of Education should also thoroughly investigate and register the talents inside and outside the province for employment. There are too many classes in middle schools, and the number of students is uncertain, which does not meet the principles of middle schools. (2) Independent educational funding. The second purpose is to strive for independent, guaranteed, and auditable educational funding in each province and city. Shandong's local educational funding is already independent, so there is no difficulty. The provincial educational funding has also increased since Chairman Han (Fu Ju) came to Shandong, so there seems to be no need to be independent immediately. The auditing of the Department of Education in this province has also achieved the greatest success. In summary, the impressions gained from the inspection in Shandong for these two major purposes are very satisfactory. The number of schools has increased greatly, and the promotion of mass education has also achieved good results. The work of the Provincial Mass Education Center is intense and can gain the welcome of the masses. If more rural teachers can become central leaders in the countryside, it will lay the foundation for the restoration of the countryside. The colleagues in the Department of Education are very serious about conducting the joint examinations, and the parents of all students approve.</p>
<p>▲ Establish an Education Museum: It is hoped that Shandong will establish an education museum in the future, with instruments, health specimens, etc., for research, and it is hoped that all educational institutions and schools can be completely interconnected and integrated, and can often meet in different places to learn from each other, so that each school can adopt the local teaching materials, so as to know the local situation. Labor education should also be implemented based on what is available locally, etc.</p>
<h3>Commissioner of the Ministry of Education Goes to Baoding for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 20th, Central News Agency) Dai Yingguan, the commissioner of education appointed by the Ministry of Education, left Ping for Baoding and Dingxian area at 2:00 PM on the 20th for inspection. According to Dai, the impression of this trip to Ping for inspection of Ping City education is very good. The schools are well-managed. After returning to Beijing, he will draft a report and submit it to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Anhui Education Department Increases the Authority of Supervisors</h3>
<p>(Anqing Correspondence) The deterioration of education in Anhui Province is undeniable. In previous years, after the start of each semester, the Education Department would dispatch supervisors to inspect various districts. However, the results were merely a perfunctory official report that was vague and did not address the specific management of each school, or whether the principals and teachers were competent. This led to a culture of following routines and being perfunctory. Now, the Education Department Director Yang Lian, in order to promote education, has divided the province's fifty-seven counties into five inspection zones and dispatched the department's supervisors to each zone. The zones are: (1) First Zone, Huaining and thirteen other counties, Ye Minghui; (2) Second Zone, Wuhu and twelve other counties, Wei Congxu; (3) Third Zone, Qingyang and eleven other counties, Zhang Shaolie; (4) Fourth Zone, Chuzhou and eleven other counties, Chen Mingxin; (5) Fifth Zone, Su County and ten other counties, Zhou Yuanji. Public and private primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in the provincial capital will be inspected jointly or in groups by the supervisors. The four counties of Liu'an, Huoqiu, Baoshan, and Lihuang have suffered from banditry and will be reorganized by specially assigned officials. After being appointed, these officials have already set off on their respective journeys. It is said that the Education Department has granted these supervisors considerable real power for this inspection. If the education bureau chiefs, principals, and teachers in each county are found to be competent, they will be immediately recommended to the department for commendation; otherwise, they will be immediately replaced. We do not know whether the future of education in Anhui Province will be completely changed by this departure from the old ways.</p>
<h3>New Building of National Central University Library Completed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency) The new building of the National Central University Library was completed on the 20th. The construction and equipment cost a total of 200,000 yuan. The reading room and research rooms can accommodate 900 people, making it the largest library in the capital. It will be open in one month.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education and General Training Department Cooperation Plan for Physical Education Colleges Canceled</h3>
<p>丨Decided to Establish Separately丨</p>
<p>▲ Ministry of Education 丨 National College of Physical Education</p>
<p>▲ Training Department 丨 Military Physical Education College</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education and the General Training Department's joint venture to run physical education colleges was discussed by Zhang Jiong, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, and the General Training Department. Because one side focuses on military physical education and the other focuses on public and school physical education, it was decided to run two schools separately. The Ministry of Education is named the National College of Physical Education, and the Training Department is named the Military Physical Education College. Both parties will still cooperate on the recruitment of teachers and the standards to be met. The Ministry of Education's preparation for the establishment of the college is underway.</p>
<h3>Hao Gengsheng Begins to Organize National Sports Work</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) Since arriving at the Ministry, Jianren Inspector Hao Gengsheng has been referring to the education laws and regulations and matters related to sports in recent days as a reference for organizing national sports. He is also planning to promote national sports in the future. In addition to following the National Physical Education Implementation Plan, he will carry out the Ministry's orders and, after a month or two, when the affairs in the Ministry are slightly organized, he may go to various places to inspect the actual situation of sports.</p>
<h3>Marathon Long-Distance Race to be Held Next Spring</h3>
<p>▲ Finish Line at Yi Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Not Borrowing the Racecourse</p>
<p>The annual seventeen-mile marathon long-distance race was not held this spring due to financial difficulties. According to Mr. McKenna, president of the Westerners' Sports Association, the matter has now been settled, and it will be held next spring as usual after the International Walking Race. As for the finish line, because the person in charge of the racecourse has unreasonably insulted the Chinese, it will also be changed to be held at Yi Yuan. "Although Chinese athletes have participated in the marathon long-distance race championship, they have not yet won it. In the second session of the Republic of China in 19 years, the Chinese participants were Huang Shengbai, Chen Xuzhou, Zhong Yutian, Dong Jiaxie, Song Zean, Zhou Yuyu, and Zhao Dexin from Liaoning. Before the race, Zhao was very hopeful of winning the championship, but unfortunately, he got lost, and his name fell to the bottom of the list. In order to prepare in advance, the track and field teams and cross-country teams of various sports associations should practice in advance so that they can win the championship and bring glory to the country."</p>
<h3>Chongde Surprises Everyone, Victory Over Liangjiang Not Easy</h3>
<p>丨Result 32 to 19丨</p>
<p>Southeast vs. Jinan Tonight</p>
<p>The Chongde Women's Basketball Team surprised everyone last night, playing against Liangjiang. The score was tied at 16 to 16 in the second half. At the end of the third quarter, Liangjiang led by only one point, with the score at 20 to 19. But in the last eight minutes, Chongde was defeated, and the final result was 32 to 19. Chongde's defense was tight, leaving the opponent with no gaps to exploit. The forwards were lively and accurate in their shots. Although they were small and weak, their defeat was still honorable. There were originally two women's basketball games scheduled for last night, but two teams were late by fifteen minutes, and the referee announced their disqualification. Guanghua won without a fight.</p>
<h3>Remotely Occupied the Upper Hand</h3>
<p>After the start of the game, Chongde gave Liangjiang a fierce resistance, and the situation was very tense. He Miaoying and Wei Peixun missed several shots. After three minutes of stalemate, Chen Rongming and Chen Xuefang of Liangjiang each scored. Chongde returned a goal by He Miaoying. From then on, Liangjiang's brilliance gradually emerged, and Chen Rongming showed great power, scoring repeatedly. In the first quarter, Liangjiang took the lead with a score of 10 to 2.</p>
<h3>Catching Up Quickly</h3>
<p>Starting from the second quarter, the situation became very tense. The Chongde girls were not willing to be outdone, and they shook off their spirits and quickly caught up. Liangjiang's defense suddenly became difficult to defend, becoming a time of trouble. The two Misses Wei and He scored every shot they made. Liangjiang's forwards were trapped in tight defense and found it difficult to move. The balls they passed out were often intercepted by the opponent, and there were not many opportunities to shoot. This quarter ended 8 to 6, with Chongde taking the lead, but Liangjiang still led by 16 to 10 in the first half overall.</p>
<h3>Score Equal</h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Chongde's spirit became even stronger, and Liangjiang's forwards had almost no chance to get the ball. Chongde's forwards were resourceful and handy. Wei Peixun was short and strong, He Miaoying was petite and exquisite, and Wang Fengqun provided effective support. Three consecutive goals were scored, resulting in a 16 to 16 tie. The Chongde girls were overjoyed. Liangjiang saw the opportunity and made a big move, immediately sending Yang Sen onto the court to save the situation. Two consecutive goals were scored, making the score 20 to 16. Chongde continued to work hard, adding three points. In the third quarter, Chongde was behind with a score of 19 to 20.</p>
<h3>Declining Rapidly</h3>
<p>Starting in the fourth quarter, Liangjiang made a final effort and returned to its full glory. Chongde's physical and mental strength was exhausted. Although they wanted to make a final struggle, their heart was willing, but their strength was insufficient. From then on, the score remained stalled, and they were unable to do anything. The Liangjiang girls took advantage of the situation and scored twelve consecutive points, winning the final victory with a score of 32 to 19.</p>
<p>▲ Liangjiang Fouls Points ▲ Chongde Fouls Points</p>
<p>Pan Meng ○ 2 Wei Peixun 1 7</p>

<h3>On Roundness and Squareness</h3>
<p>— Anfu</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a shape without sharp corners is called round. The shape of an object that is upright is called square. Round is the opposite of square; square is the opposite of round. Even small children know these two opposing shapes.</p>
<p>Round and square are originally nouns describing states; however, there are also differences in their prominence and obscurity in their fate. The round thing, it can be said, is the best symbol of both ancient and modern times, especially the thoroughly modernized present. Generally speaking, when describing the temperament of ordinary people, those who can be accommodating are called well-rounded, and those who are harmonious are called harmonious. In Buddhism, those who are quick-witted and enlightened are called perfect and wonderful. Therefore, Guanyin Bodhisattva is also called the Great Master of Perfect Understanding. The sky is also called round spirit or round sugar, and the earth is also round. Beautiful women are called round. A full moon also represents perfect reunion. Even foreign coins, jiao coins, and copper plates are all round. True beauties and money are both round, and one must also think from a round perspective to gain reputation. What else do the myriad living beings in the world seek besides these three? Roundness is truly the only treasure in the world.</p>
<p>As for the square thing, it is not right. We only need to look at the common saying "square handle in a round mortise" to understand. Squareness is actually an inauspicious adjective, the most annoying, and also the most out of touch with the times. For example, dialects cannot be widely used (Fang Yan, not written by Yang Xiong). Magical arts cannot reach the height of elegance. A person who is upright is scolded as a dead Amu Lin. The statements of alchemists are absurd. And Fang Hui of the Song Dynasty was despised by people. Fang Xiaoru of the Ming Dynasty was killed, and ten generations of his family were exterminated. In short, squareness is an inauspicious thing.</p>
<p>Squareness is the most useless thing in the present. Roundness is a necessary tool for being a person. I can't help but shout for roundness and wish you longevity!</p>

<p>Cholera has lost its empire, and red and white dysentery has also fallen from the throne. The autumn wind is blowing so strongly. Well, from now on, "coal gas poisoning" should be a wonderful embellishment in the daily social news.</p>
<p>The rich people cover themselves with silk quilts and wool blankets, and heat water radiators and electric heaters. They are warm and hygienic. The poor people wear tattered cotton jackets and cover themselves with old, tattered quilts. Damn it, they are frozen awake in the quilts before midnight. How can they endure until dawn? Okay, let's move the coal briquette stove for cooking to the front of the bed tomorrow! Add enough coal briquettes, and it'll be warm and comfortable. But, this comfort is not a big deal, but tomorrow there may be a danger of "deeply poisoned, incurable."</p>
<p>From this "coal gas poisoning" incident, we are reminded of many "coal gas poisoning" things in society.</p>
<p>When I was studying as a child, I was most afraid of serious teachers, especially during small and big exams, absolutely not allowing cheating or copying books. Therefore, serious teachers are often sacrificed by the trend, while mediocre teachers receive strong support. This situation is no different from sleeping next to a coal briquette stove.</p>
<p>After arguing with my wife two or three times, damn it, I'll go out and play with women. It's not like I can't get comfort other than my wife. But, uh, I spent a lot of money and only got a little bit of her affection. This is still considered good. If you're unlucky and encounter a honey trap and get a venereal disease, your reputation will be ruined. This is "deeply poisoned, incurable."</p>
<p>No money to spend, borrow money. No place to borrow at low interest, borrow usurious loans. The money is borrowed and spent comfortably, and I feel relieved. But before I can feel relieved, the creditor is already knocking on the door with a livid face. Unable to repay the principal and interest, I have no choice but to be grabbed by the creditor's chest, slapped with a big palm, and with tears and snot, regret that I should not have been indecisive, resulting in "coal gas poisoning."</p>
<p>Whether it is a large country or a small individual, seeking temporary pleasure while ignoring the possible dangers is inevitable to suffer from "coal gas poisoning." This is a lesson for standing in the world.</p>
<h3>Needle</h3>
<p>— Fu Hongyi</p>
<p>Don't regret yesterday, don't hope for tomorrow, but respect today. Don't resent the past, don't calculate the future, but grasp the present.</p>
<p>In a realistic society, if you want to find friends with pure hearts and faithful behavior, you can only run to the children's team.</p>
<p>The "No Urinating" sign is not effective, so "Offenders will be sent to the police" or "Urinators will be fined five yuan" are added under "No Urinating." But, in the end, it's still the same. Here, I have to learn from Lu Xun and say, "Understanding these things is understanding most of the Chinese people."</p>
<h3>Punishment for Sleeping</h3>
<p>— Xie Jiju</p>
<p>If Zai Yu sleeps during the day, it is certainly "rotten wood cannot be carved," but Confucius only lamented Zai Yu's unsuitability, and did not revoke his qualification to hear the Dao. Not revoking his qualification to hear the Dao is to want him to understand the Dao, know his mistakes, and perhaps also be able to change his ways and become a complete person because he knows where his mistakes are. This is not impossible.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain university gave student A "a demerit" for "dozing in class." At the same time, a student in the school's attached middle school was also sleeping in class, so the school authorities "considering his first offense," ingeniously gave the student the punishment of "not being allowed to take civics class" and posted it publicly for all to know.</p>
<p>It is also an undeniable fact that students in general have become too casual in class recently. Sleeping in class certainly has to be punished, and giving a demerit is not inappropriate in terms of educational principles, in the sense of punishing one to warn a hundred. But whether it is appropriate to not allow him to take civics class still needs to be considered. You need to know that civics is a science that teaches people about perfect personality, and is the theoretical course of school education. Students read civics to understand the rules of being a person, understand common malpractices and mistakes, and then eliminate them, and walk on the path to a perfect life. Because a student sleeps in class, he is not allowed to take civics class, in other words, he is not allowed to have the right to be a citizen. This punishment for sleeping really needs to be studied and criticized by educators!</p>
<h3>A Story of Beards</h3>
<p>— Canye</p>
<p>In ancient Eastern nations, there was a deep superstition that a man's beard was a symbol of glory, and when punishing someone, they would force him to shave off his beard and cut his hair short. But looking at ancient Assyrian sculptures, the images of the emperors are all with long beards fluttering in front of their chests, and their hair is always long, while the slaves serving on the left and right do not have a single beard, shaving their faces clean, and their hair is also shaved like monks. The distinction between noble and lowly is of course obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>The opinions of the Egyptians, however, were different from those of the Assyrians. They believed that beards and hair were dirty things and parasites that sucked blood from the human body, so they had to shave their heads and faces completely. Their servants were also forced to do the same and were not allowed to keep them long.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece and Rome, when fighting against enemies, their beards were often grabbed and they were defeated, suffering greatly. Therefore, they all cut off their beards and hair, leaving no hair. It is said that King Alexander the Great strictly ordered his soldiers to shave their beards for this reason.</p>
<p>According to ancient Roman customs, when men turned twenty-one, they had to shave off their beards and offer them before the idols in their homes. When they grew their beards again after this age, it meant that a family member had died.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to be together, yet wanting to separate, in the same car, recalling past events, half crying, half laughing, leaning on the pillow, sick in late autumn</p>
<p>On the avenue northeast of Haidian, the departing troops were marching further and further away, and a large group of people who came to see them off stood by the roadside, all dazed. Ms. Jiang saw Guizhi pinching the corner of her long coat, silently, slowly rubbing it there. Although she was standing facing the northeast corner, her eyes were looking at the closest piece of ground. She was naturally thinking about something, but was she feeling better in her heart, or was she not feeling better in her heart? This could not be known. Ms. Jiang took a step closer, stood close to her, and asked, "Girl, what's wrong with you? Let's go back." Guizhi smiled at her mother inexplicably and said, "That's right, we should go back. What are we waiting for?" After saying that, she walked in front. So, Zhao Weng and Huang Manying followed her into the house. The most wonderful thing was that they did not walk back to their backyard, but also followed to the Yang family. Ms. Jiang walked in front, sighed, and said, "In the past, when I saw soldiers, I hated them in my heart. Now when I see soldiers, I just pity them. I feel that what I did in the past was really wrong. If I have a son, I won't..." When she got to this point, Guizhi turned her head and smiled, "The old master is here too. Please sit down." Ms. Jiang smiled, "Look, I'm really careless, the old master is here, and I didn't see him. Girl, go make some boiling water." Zhao Weng was also inexplicable, how he followed his in-law mother and walked to this place. Since he had already walked into the door, there was no way he could leave without saying anything. He could only smile and say, "Don't bother, I see that you are feeling a little uncomfortable, and this Miss Huang also has a kind of unspeakable suffering in her heart, so I came to talk to everyone to relieve the boredom." Ms. Jiang smiled, "Oh! Can our hearts be more uncomfortable than the old master's?" Zhao Weng sat down and smiled, "Everything is a habit. My family Zi Qiang has been leaving me for a long time since he became an adult. Now that he is not in front of me, I don't miss him so much. He is such a big son, he can't be held in my arms and raised." (245)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Gambling</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanying</p>
<p>It was agreed to be eight rounds, and then four more rounds were added. After twelve rounds of mahjong, it was almost one-thirty in the morning.</p>
<p>Walking out of my friend's front door, the north wind hit my face, and a chill rose from my heart. Although there were two partners walking with me, it could not make my thoughts linger on the joy any longer.</p>
<p>I arrived home, and my sister opened the door. Another feeling ran deep into my heart, and tears unconsciously fell down.</p>
<p>Mother was sick; my sister's eyebrows were tightly furrowed, showing worry. I came out early in the morning and only returned at this moment.</p>
<p>"Were you gambling again?"</p>
<p>I had no courage to ask how Mother was feeling, but Mother said this as soon as she saw me step in the door. I know that Mother was not complaining to me, because Mother is too kind and has never used harsh words to me. However, when I heard it, it was like being stabbed by a sharp blade! Ah! I should think carefully, did I do something wrong? I had no words to answer!</p>
<p>"Take care of your body!"</p>
<p>Recently, I have been obsessed with gambling, and I always come back at twelve or one o'clock every night. Mother said to take care of my body, but have I ever thought about it myself?</p>
<p>I turned on the light in my bedroom. Hearing Mother's painful coughing in the next room, grief occupied my whole mind and body.</p>
<p>Thanks to the care of my clan uncle, I was able to find this position, and my monthly income is five times more than before in the factory. Therefore, it is enough to maintain the livelihood of the whole family, so that we will not often fall into the abyss of hardship again. However, I suddenly became addicted to gambling, not returning home for dinner two or three times a week, and going to my colleagues' homes to play for winnings. Mother and sister are waiting at home, and the weather has become severe. They endure the cold for me, and tomorrow morning they still have to get up before dawn to cook breakfast for me for the sake of my office work.</p>
<p>Mother has been suffering from a cough these past few days, and the cough syrup has been ineffective, and it seems to only be getting worse. How could I not see Mother's illness as more important than my own winnings, and still gamble late into the night? Mother's illness may even be caused by me.</p>
<p>Money won also has a day to be spent, let alone that I have been poor until now, and I don't necessarily lack these few dollars I won. If I don't care about Mother's pain and indulge my own selfish desires, even if I can change from utter poverty to great wealth from today to tomorrow, how will I comfort my elderly Mother?</p>
<p>Lying in bed, the thoughts in my mind were like ten thousand horses galloping back and forth. I hated myself to the extreme!</p>
<p>My elderly Mother has endured hardship and suffered. Since Father died ten years ago, her teeth have fallen out one by one, and her white hair has gradually increased, but she doesn't feel sad or worried at all, but just labors with a smile, diligently raising her son! Me. What is the root cause of Mother's joy? I am very clear in my chest, but am I walking towards the goal that Mother expects, making Mother even more joyful? Alas! The truth is the opposite. Even if I kneel down and cry to Mother in repentance, there is no room for forgiveness!</p>
<p>The result of gambling is that I always lose. Three yuan, five yuan, the family's living expenses are captured by other people's cunning after each unsuccessful round of dominoes. On the one hand, I try my best to tell Mother and sister to be frugal, and that we should save a certain amount of money each month; and Mother and sister are really able to do as I say. I don't eat lunch at home, and they only cook porridge, swallowing it with a fried dough stick. And what about myself? Heavens! I am recklessly losing money in gambling without any restraint!</p>
<p>I saw Father's face with a bitter smile looking at me, the meaning of "Son, how have you changed?" shamed me into losing consciousness; Mother's moaning sound was responding to Father's bitter smile. Alas! My tears have run dry! Should I work hard to redeem myself?</p>

<h3>Securities: Fujian Incident Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse, Most Bonds See New Low Prices; Powerful Sellers Are Overwhelming, Future Still Has the Potential for a Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the increasingly serious situation in Fujian, long positions were extremely panicked, and the situation worsened. Evening newspapers reported that the last hope for Fujian's independence had been dashed. Fortunately, Guangdong's attitude was clear, and it continued to cooperate with the central government, but it was feared that the internal disputes would inevitably lead to the use of force. The domestic situation was already riddled with problems, and this blow further weakened the national strength. Therefore, the future of the bond market was difficult to be optimistic about, and the major sellers became increasingly overwhelming. Major short seller No. 50 continued to sell off in large quantities. The market opened in the morning with the imminent outbreak of the Fujian incident, and long positions rushed to exit, while short positions increased their holdings. Apart from military reorganization and troop reduction falling by one yuan, the decline slowed slightly after that, but all fell by more than half a yuan. Gold short positions rose by 0.3 yuan alone this month, which was entirely due to swap relations and had nothing to do with the overall trend of rising or falling. According to the ordinary situation of the second session, because the front rows of the first session fell more and the back rows fell less, the front rows of the second session should have rebounded slightly, but because sellers continued to flood in, the fact was the opposite, and it still felt weak. Only because of the swap relationship, the rises and falls could not be consistent. The market opened again in the afternoon and reached 4:30, and another session was done as usual. The initial trading was still flat, but after that, part of the news of Fujian's independence increased the number of sellers. Major sellers such as Nos. 21 and 50 still sold in large amounts, so the back rows all fell, and the gold short positions even fell by one yuan. In summary, the market prices all led the decline by 0.7-0.8 jiao to 1.2-1.3 jiao, and most had already seen new low prices. The trend was temporarily difficult to see a reversal, and it was feared that there was still a short squeeze. The total transaction volume was 23,895,000 yuan, and there were no spot transactions. Futures trading included 5,950,000 yuan for unified salt tax, 3,155,000 yuan for troop reduction, 2,320,000 yuan for the 19 Customs, and 3,200,000 yuan for the 20 rolls and 20 Customs, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 2.2 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Rises and Falls Back After US-Soviet Resumption of Relations</h3>
<p>New F丰洋行 reports that on the 18th, the New York stock market initially saw the stocks of companies that benefited the most from the resumption of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union surge by as much as two yuan, and the overall market situation was also prosperous. However, this was only a flash in the pan. Trading turned quiet, and prices fell back. The reason was still nothing more than the chaos of the currency issue. As a result, both rises and falls were seen, and there seemed to be an upward trend. Half-day trading volume was 578,000 shares. "Wheat" lacked new buyers, and long positions were disappointed and closed, causing a fall. There was no news to encourage trading. "Cotton" rumors of Soviet Russia purchasing large quantities of cotton resurfaced, but the US government did not provide credit guarantees, so the market situation was not affected. The common opinion of brokers was slightly bullish. The Financial Rehabilitation Corporation's purchase price of gold was 33.569 per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　98.67　Up 0.58</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Indication of Stable Yarn and Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market showed a slight weakening trend in the morning, due to reports that the situation in Fujian was becoming more urgent, and that severe financial turmoil had occurred in Bengbu and Xuzhou, causing some panic. However, after a certain association maintained stability, there was a great lack of chips on the market. Therefore, although the environment was bad, there were still few changes. Judging from the general trend, it still cannot escape the trend of hovering.</p>
<h3>Human Labels: No Significant Gains or Losses</h3>
<p>The human label market opened in the morning with rumors of the situation rising again, government bonds falling, and morale depressed, with each month falling by 1, 2, 3, and 4 jiao. In the afternoon, the near months were flat, and the far months saw scattered short covering, rebounding by 1, 3, and 4 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 7,800 bales. Sales included 1,800 bales from Changfeng, 550 bales from Hengchang, 300 bales from Dachang, and 250 bales from Gengfeng. Purchases included 600 bales from Meiji, 300 bales from Yicheng, 350 bales from Yiyu, 300 bales from Tonghe, 200 bales from Yuda, and 200 bales from Jifeng. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Weak Spot Yarn Consumption</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are quite sluggish. According to statistics, various groups purchased a total of 707 bales throughout the day. The market situation was flat. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>North Group　10</p>
<p>Changsha　100</p>
<p>Guangdong　27</p>
<p>Jiangxi　50</p>

<p>Nanjing　1</p>
<p>Ningbo　16</p>
<p>Shantou　10</p>
<p>Zhenjiang　10</p>
<p>The cotton market this month is gradually approaching the delivery period, and long positions are still not letting go. The overseas cotton market saw mixed rises and falls, and morale remained firm. Scattered investors were covering short positions in the near months, causing prices to rise. However, Indian cotton prices tended to loosen, and 1,000 pieces of white rock cotton from Hengfeng Factory were priced lower. Judging from the general trend, it is also a flat situation.</p>
<h3>Zheng Label: Safe</h3>
<p>The Zheng label market opened flat in the morning, but the current month was particularly tight, with short positions covering. The far months fell slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. In the afternoon, the Ningbo group covered short positions, and the market trend was slightly firm, with each month rising by 0.05 to 0.2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,700 dan.

<h3>Indian Cotton on Sale</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton is still flat, and Indian cotton is on sale again, and there is a tendency to overshadow local cotton. The sources include 870 bales of Yao cotton and 1,570 bales of Tong cotton. The prices of spot cotton are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton　41.50　Hongzhang Factory Intake　200 pieces　Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Shashi Cotton　38.50　Dongmianxing Intake　200 pieces　Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton　37.25　Dongmianxing Intake　200 pieces　Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Gradually Shows Signs of Falling Last Week</h3>
<p>The market situation last week was firm and stable, with little fluctuation, and seemed to be waiting for the development of US cotton. Later, due to the relationship of silver prices, it gradually showed signs of falling. Unfortunately, the arrival of goods was delayed, and short selling was ineffective, so there was no sharp fall. The market situation was quite favorable for cross-selling households. Japanese merchants were active, and European exporters were insignificant. There were no spot transactions. The local factory situation was not good, and some factories were forced to sell 10,000 bales at low prices. The weather was good, and harvesting was smooth. The statistics for last week are appended below: (Unit: 1,000 bales)</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Still Trending Weak</h3>
<p>Lyon white filature has again reported a fall. The Lyon raw silk market has recently been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk due to the fall in the Japanese silk exchange rate, and the international situation is tense, with dramatic exchange rate fluctuations. The general silk weaving factory adopts the main principle of using raw silk materials as needed and discussing them as they are used, and dare not risk stockpiling. Therefore, silk sales are sluggish, and Chinese silk prices also fall. Grade A white filature only opens at 81.25 francs, and Grade B opens at 71.25 francs, a drop of 2.5 francs per kilogram compared to last week. Converted to national currency, the price per bale is also about 20 yuan less.</p>
<p>Dried Filature Sales to the US Completely Stalled　My country only has the Ji Li dried filature, which has always relied on sales to the US as a breakthrough. In recent years, due to the mutual dumping of Japanese silk and rayon, the sales of dried filature to the US have plummeted. In the middle of this month, they have completely stalled. Only two bales of new sample silk have been shipped to New York.</p>
<p>Rayon Sales Have No Prospects for Improvement　Recently, foreign exchange fluctuations have been quite dramatic, and rayon sales have no prospects for improvement. Yesterday, only 12 boxes of spot goods such as thread belt factory's earth silk, blue ning word, etc. were taken in, with a net transaction price of 150.5 to 153.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Sales to the US Await Opportunities　The US government has changed its Secretary of the Treasury, and the idea of currency inflation is gaining momentum. However, the US exchange rate fluctuates greatly, international news is bad, and labor strikes in silk dyeing and weaving factories have not yet been resolved. New York has a thick inventory of silk, and demand is not rising. Chinese silk sales to the US await opportunities. Although speculators are trying to push up prices, the opening prices are too small. Most of the silk stored by US silk merchants has already been pledged, and they are quietly waiting for the opportunity. Silk sales in London and Paris are still sluggish. Yesterday, only Hang Silk Factory took in 10 bales of white filature, and Indian and French firms took in 10 bales of Sichuan filature and 5 bales of white dried filature. Prices are still depressed.</p>
<h3>Grain: Tianjin Merchants Rush to Buy Spot Flour, Standard Flour Shows Rare Soaring ▲ This Month's Futures Jump by a Huge 9 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a rare surge, and the near-term market was even more激昂. Although foreign wheat quotations fell by 7-8 jiao in Chicago and about 2-3 jiao in Canada, the crazy increase in morale was because Tianjin spot flour, after the North China Agreement and the recovery of the war zone, the sales market was increasing step by step. Therefore, the demand for flour in that area is also prospering. The spot flour bid price rose by another 0.6 fen the day before yesterday, to 2.51 yuan, so after the opening, that group rushed to buy without limiting the price, and the market was immediately shaken. Later, the quotation also became more and more attractive due to market speculation and successive bids. Until the opening of the afternoon market, morale was even more tense. This month's opening was as high as 2.37 yuan, and trading was also very active. In the middle, due to Kangjia's offer and floating long positions returning, it fell by 0.1 fen, but it remained firm until the fifth session. According to the analysis, this step-by-step increase, recently due to the smooth sales of spot goods, and the rumors of increased taxes in the long term, so the trend of falling has changed, and the trend of rising is also difficult to suppress. As a result, this month rose by a huge 9 fen compared to the day before yesterday, December rose by 7.25 li, January rose by 6 fen, February rose by 4.75 li, March rose by 4.25 li, and April rose by 4.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Label Flour Assists the Rise in Long-Term Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of various months all rose sharply. The price of foreign wheat was difficult to return by 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao in Chicago and Canada. However, recently, the morale of the market seems to have paid little attention to the price of foreign wheat. Most of them have focused on the facts. Therefore, the buying of large households has focused on the bottom of wheat stocks. Because the source of domestic wheat has dried up recently, and the flour sales market is active, the subsequent demand for wheat is naturally tightening. Therefore, the middle aspect of the manufacturers has been advancing step by step. Yesterday, the flour market soared again, which led to a crazy increase in the wheat market. The opening price was only better than 0.3-0.5 fen, and then it continued to jump due to the rise in flour. According to the speculation of those in the industry, it is feared that there is still a trend of continued increase in the near future. As a result, this month rose by 0.11 yuan, December rose by 0.1 yuan, January rose by 0.11 yuan, February rose by 0.1 yuan, March rose by 0.09 yuan, and April rose by 0.13 yuan. Due to the bargaining between goods and customers and the high price of label wheat, there was no trading in spot wheat.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Weaken by Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources arrived in an endless stream, with 70-80 dealers and about 10,000 dan of goods. However, the sales channels were even more prosperous than yesterday, with more than 7,000 bags (more than 8,000 dan) from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingjiao and other groups. Therefore, the overall situation in the city was quite crowded. However, the market situation was difficult to turn firm due to the continued influx of late rice sources, with 40-50 dealers (7,000-8,000 dan), so the market situation was still heading downstream. According to statistics, the prices of Qingjiao, Fengsong, Jiangxi Lian, etc. were reduced by more than one chi. As for the Changbang Sutong Nangang and other japonica rice and Duyang pointed rice, the sales of Benjie Nagui were still good, but due to being牵于晚, the market price fell by a few jiao or so. Yin yuan wine households were quite active, and the market color turned beautiful again.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) More than 40 sources from various routes, and the sales in the market were quiet. The market's new 籼, early market firm, and the afternoon market weakened by a few fen. The prices of Bo rice and early rice were low, and there were no gains or losses in Baiyuan, Yin yuan, and 客秈.</p>
<h3>Min Bang to Stop Handling 客秈 ▲Those who handled the day before also had a delay in loading▲</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of 客秈 was flat and soft. Because Min Bang has been in strong demand recently, it has been unable to handle as much as possible due to the obstruction of the situation. Yesterday, the group received a telegram from Fujian Province, informing them to temporarily stop loading. Therefore, the group's willingness to handle it was even weaker. Yesterday, the Fuzhou Bang only responded to 40 bags of Hunan machine 秈 rice, priced at 8 yuan, and 22 bags of machine red rice, priced at 7.4 jiao. The Quanzhou Bang handled 488 bags of Shashi rough rice, priced at 5.5 jiao. Benjie responded to 100 bags of Shashi machine yuan, priced at 7.47 jiao. The small number of 客秈 responded to by Fujian Province temporarily declared that if they could not be shipped, they would also have to be returned in full. The group has not yet cleared the rice that it had previously handled, and may temporarily suspend payment and installation due to receiving a telegram from the group. However, the goods owners were unwilling to sell at low prices due to high production prices and high costs. Therefore, the market prices of the various rices opened were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Soybean Factory Sales Suddenly Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean factories saw a sudden increase in sales, and the morale remained quite stable under the two-fold pressure of inventory and production. The selling price was also slightly tighter. Yesterday, Benjie sold two cars to Zhengyangguan, one car to Xuzhou, two cars to Bengbu, and five cars to Wuhe in the inland, 150 bags to Tancheng. The factory also sold more than 2,000 bags of round goods and 14 cars of goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Crude Sand and White Sugar Sales Increase ▲ There May Be a Rise in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's momentum gradually turned flat and stable due to increased sales. The association划盘二四 crude sand and white ordinary goods still had a 划盘 of 20.15 yuan, and the transshipment bill of lading opened at 7.15 yuan, with a total of more than 1,000 bags sold, which was the largest number of transactions after the price drop. The high price of eight or nine Dutch 赤 was 16 yuan, the ordinary BDA mark was 15.62 yuan, the Taikoo sugar B mark was 20.5 jiao, the CW mark was 20.4 jiao, and the Zhonghua Guohua No. 1 cotton white was still 19 yuan, and the proposed price was the same. The remaining No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were refunded. Yesterday, Dushunhao first arrived at 41 bags in Xinhuqing, with a price of 16 yuan, and it is estimated that the market can be completed today. Chen goods still have stable opening prices due to the advantage of better body color. More than 100 bags were opened yesterday, with the highest price of Gaolonggang Qing being 14.7-14.8 jiao and the lowest price being 14.1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Japanese Riding Breeches Fabric Mixed into the Market</h3>
<p>Riding breeches fabric has remained scarce recently. Even if buyers are willing to pay the full price for dark-colored ones, it is not easy to find them for the time being. The Western goods 1005 brand have been sold off in order, and their sales price is still more than 8 yuan. Therefore, some unscrupulous merchants are secretly contacting Japanese merchants. It is heard that several boxes of East goods riding breeches fabric have been sold in Benjie yesterday, with the wholesale transaction price being 7.15 yuan per yard. The quality and color are exactly the same as the Western goods 1005. It is said that samples were first cut to Japan for custom weaving, and the numbers were deliberately reversed, with the word 5001 printed in each yard, making it difficult for outsiders to distinguish the true from the false. I hope that the woolen suit industry and the outsiders who make riding breeches and overcoats will pay attention to the two kinds of word prints: East goods 5001 and West goods 1005.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Increased with the US Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The recent increase in the US tinplate price has been due to the shrinking of the US exchange rate and the soaring of the fixed order price. The market price in Benbu has also followed the trend, and the current price of 90 pounds is estimated at 16.5 yuan, which is 0.2 jiao better than before. The price of 100 pounds is 17.5 yuan, which is 0.1 jiao higher than before. However, the market atmosphere has been rising sharply in recent days, and the market situation has become more and more solid. It is heard that the overseas telegrams state that the price of 90 pounds of US tinplate is 4.4 gold yuan per box, and the price of 100 pounds is 4.6 gold yuan, all of which are better than before by 0.1-0.2 gold yuan.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Realistic Understanding (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>When I explained the unreality of "Sanine," I mentioned that it was related to the author's artistic skill. Shortly after, I saw a criticism from a certain gentleman regarding my opinion. According to him, the reality of a character is determined by whether it actually exists, and has nothing to do with artistic skill. This conflict of opinions perhaps reveals a fundamental difference in our observations of art. For example, metaphorically speaking, in the case of creating characters, he views the function of art as a camera. No matter how skillful the photographer's technique, a real, existing person is always necessary. Conversely, I see art as the painter's brush, paints, and canvas. If a painter has a model in front of them, the object, though fixed in form, may not be reproduced exactly on the colored canvas. But if an image is born in the painter's mind, even if there is no actual model in front of them, their creation of a character can still be equally real. In short, I am opposed to viewing art as something overly mechanical.</p>
<p>That art cannot be said to be divorced from reality when it actually fulfills its artistic mission is indeed a principle. But this cannot lead to the conclusion that art must be a faithful reflection of reality. Because, for an artist or writer, the truthfulness of their creation does not lie in whether or not there is reality involved, but in the degree and accuracy of their understanding of reality, and how to concretely form their understanding into a work of art without destroying the integrity of the art. Therefore, the reality of art, or the reality that is transferred into art, is not merely an expression of the writer's general understanding of reality. The understanding must be profound and accurate, and the expression of that understanding must also be artistically accurate. To put it more clearly, the process of artistic creation has two steps: the first is the understanding of reality, and the second is artistic expression. What I previously referred to as "artistic skill" refers to the latter. If I have overlooked the importance of the first step and only valued the second step, then I should admit that I was wrong. But in fact, I have not done so. I said that "Sanine" has an exaggerated and inaccurate expression based on errors in the understanding of reality. Indeed, the reason why I criticize "Sanine" is because it has shortcomings in both of these aspects. Therefore, although I have not denied the first step, a certain gentleman clearly denies the second step, which cannot but be said to be his mistake.</p>
<p>It is easiest to prove this reason by comparing and examining Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" and Artsybashev's "Sanine." Judging from the reactions that "Fathers and Sons" aroused in Russian society at the time of its publication, we cannot but doubt the truthfulness of the protagonist Bazarov. At that time, the older generation of fathers in Russia undoubtedly resented this type of person, while the younger generation of sons did not welcome him either, claiming that they were misrepresented. Both the old and the young relentlessly roared at the author of "Fathers and Sons," causing him to leave his homeland in tears, but he still stubbornly said, "Here is the prototype of a new era without any discount." Later, time proved that Turgenev's claim was not wrong. "Fathers and Sons," with its deep understanding of reality and its correct artistic expression, allowed this "prototype" to gradually grow. Eventually, people of the Bazarov type appeared in Russian society, and Bazarov himself was worthy of being a typical character.</p>
<h3>On "Lying"</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>It is said that modern youth need to "lie." But some young people who like "simplicity" seem to be sighing again. Regarding this, I feel that I can only learn the tone of "Zhuangzi" and say: "Is the 'lying' of lying really lying? Is the 'truth' of truth really truth?"</p>
<p>I remember such a story: In a certain village, there were a father and son. In winter, they went to the mountain to chop firewood. Halfway through the work, the father sat on a stone and smoked. The son suddenly had a whim and thought of a question, so he asked: "Dad, do you think that at this time, the emperor must be using a golden axe to chop firewood on the royal mountain, right?" The father listened and scoffed. Then, he seriously said: "Nonsense, why would the emperor chop firewood? At this time, he must be sitting in front of the royal palace, in the sun, holding a golden pipe and smoking."</p>
<p>I think the father ridiculed his son's ideal of "the emperor using a golden axe to chop firewood" from the perspective of smoking, and pointed it out as nonsense; this is what the so-called "simple" youth now say is a precedent for modern youth to "lie." But in fact, the emperor is bound to hold a golden pipe and smoke, and will never take a golden axe to chop firewood. So the father's era was ultimately victorious. And simple youth can also stand on the front line.</p>
<p>However, I also remember Shun, the old emperor of China. Records of the Grand Historian, Basic Annals of the Five Emperors: "Shun plowed on Mount Li, and the people of Mount Li all yielded the boundaries; he fished in Lei Ze, and the people on Lei Ze all yielded their residences; he made pottery on the banks of the river, and the utensils on the banks of the river were all not badly made; in one year, the place where he lived became a settlement, in two years it became a town, and in three years it became a capital." Then Yao, under the tribal chief meeting, (see Shangshu "Consult the Four Mountains, I have been in office for seventy years," section) ceded the throne to Shun. After Shun became emperor, did he still "take a golden axe to chop firewood" and go farming and fishing? History has no clear statement, and it is not possible to speculate, but in light of the saying "The head rises, the workers flourish," the so-called Shun, who became emperor, was still participating in productive labor, and not just "sitting in front of the royal palace, in the sun, holding a golden pipe and smoking" to please himself, but that is a fact. Therefore, in the name of "being a person," the son's "lying" seems to be lovely. Perhaps this lie will turn into "truth."</p>
<p>However, precisely because this "lie" may become the truth, the "simple" youth have to stand up and scold the liar and advocate the so-called "philosophy of smoking." Moreover, the world is turbulent, everyone smokes, and cigarettes are attached with lottery tickets, and there is also an opportunity to get rich. If someone uses the words "the emperor must take a golden axe to chop firewood" again, there are few who will not be "pushed" or "kicked" by those who are good at smoking. And those who read "Zhuangzi," such as this humble little one, naturally have to shake their heads and sigh: "Is the 'truth' of truth really truth? Is the 'lying' of lying really lying?"</p>
<h3>Impressions of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>After the boy came to collect the tea money, the skyline of this ancient capital had already emerged far outside the train window. Under the strong sunlight, it looked like a shimmering piece, as ethereal as a dream, as hazy as a mist, not as majestic as described in the Beiping guide.</p>
<p>The train arrived at the station, and I squeezed through the crowd onto the platform. After a thorough inspection of the luggage, I squeezed out of the station on the platform again. Outside the station was a square, with dozens of rickshaws parked. "Coolies" with oily sweat on their faces were clamoring to come forward to solicit people squeezing out of the station gate. Two purple-faced policemen in yellow uniforms were waving rattan whips there to "maintain order," urging them to make way for "cars picking up lords and ladies." One car, two cars, three cars... the cars sped away from the station entrance, wrapping up a gust of dust like a thick fog, shrouding the square in front of the station. The remaining passengers without cars, the police, and the "coolies" struggled and wrangled in this dust.</p>
<p>I jumped into a rickshaw. In this man-made fog, the rickshaw puller pulled me out of the square. In front of me was the towering Zhengyang Gate. Looking at it in the dust, it seemed quite majestic, just saying that the city wall was more than three zhang high and five or six zhang wide; but somehow I only felt that it was listless, like a Vajra in a dilapidated temple.</p>
<p>× × × × × × ×</p>
<p>What is Beiping's impression on me? I can't say. Compared to the places I have been to, Beiping often reminds me of Suzhou in the south. On the surface, Beiping and Suzhou are simply not alike. From the perspective of color, Beiping belongs to rich and gorgeous, and Suzhou is plain. The roof tiles of Beiping have green, yellow, blue, and various other colors, the doors and windows are often vermilion lacquered, and women also love to wear bright red and green clothes; Suzhou is all black tiles and black lacquered walls, and women like plain attire. In terms of shape, Beiping is broad, and Suzhou is small and exquisite. The streets of Beiping need not be said, even a few large hutongs are wider than the main streets of Suzhou. In addition, of course, there are many places that are completely dissimilar, but these are only material differences.</p>
<p>In spirit, Beiping and Suzhou belong to the same category. The most obvious example is language. In the south, the most pleasant and playful is the "soft language of Wu" in Suzhou, and in the north, it is the "Beijing dialect" of Beiping. These two languages can be said to be "equally skilled" in terms of technique, both of which can roll on the tongue like lotus beads, and when listening carefully, they are the same, both containing a strong "feminine attraction." Aren't the ladies in the North-South social circles saying that they love a few words of Beijing dialect or Wu dialect?</p>
<p>Not only are the languages similar, but the atmosphere is also not different. Living in Beiping or Suzhou makes you feel so comfortable that your muscles and bones are numb. If you live in Beiping for three or two years, you will play with antiques, listen to Mei Lanfang, and feel that there is nothing else to do. In Suzhou, you will listen to storytellers, eat watermelon seeds, and feel that there is nothing else to do. When you speak Beijing dialect or Wu dialect fluently, you will understand what "pi sai" is, or what "Tang Bohu Points Autumn Fragrance" is. In addition, you will only shout "Menluocai" wildly in the theater, or spit a ground of watermelon seeds in the teahouse.</p>
<p>In short, Beiping is just an enlarged antique shop, and Suzhou is just an enlarged "Daoxiangcun."</p>
<p>I have only been to Beiping for less than two months, and I have not had the time to appreciate all the famous historical sites here one by one. Judging only from the places I have visited, there is really nothing new. Most of them have already been seen in photographs or paintings, and although the real scene is much larger than the one in the painting, it does not have the beauty in the painting. But when wandering in the Forbidden City, I seemed to feel a kind of flowing emotion rippling there, which was not present when looking at photographs and paintings. I looked with my eyes wide open 丨 丨</p>
<p>A glory that has lost its life is declining, declining there.</p>
<h3>Huaqing Pool</h3>
<p>— Qian Bai</p>
<p>"In the cold of spring, the Emperor bestows a bath at Huaqing Pool, the hot spring water smooths her creamy skin," what a fragrant and tender scene this is!</p>
<p>This Huaqing Pool is located in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, a four-hour bus ride from Xi'an. Barren earthen forts, roads covered with gray sand, people with dark faces and hunger, and the air is so dull. From the outer contours, no one can believe that there would be a peerless beauty who "makes the beauties of the six palaces lose their color," leaving behind such romantic traces. However, history clearly tells us that there was such a miracle!</p>
<p>In order to preserve the ancient romance, someone recently renovated this Huaqing Pool. A main pool for water distribution was built under Mount Li, with an average water temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Two water distribution pools were also built, and water was distributed from the distribution pools to the East Pool, West Pool, Great Pool, and Concubine Pool. Bathing in the East Pool and West Pool is subject to a fee, and the price required is by no means affordable for ordinary people in Lintong. Therefore, there is a Great Pool to provide those who cannot afford the money with a bathing opportunity. Of course, if there is no distinction between levels, there will be many inconveniences. There is also the Concubine Pool, which is said to be the place where Yang Yuhuan washed her creamy body in those years. It is now for female guests to bathe in. Ordinary smelly men are of course not allowed to enter, so as not to offend the dignity of the Concubine.</p>
<p>We arrived here at around ten o'clock in the morning. Regardless of whether there is still the fragrance of Yuhuan left in the water, we always have to take a bath. Immersed in the pool built of cement and alum stone, thinking that when Yuhuan bathed here in those days, this pool may not have been as elaborate as it is now.</p>
<p>After leaving Huaqing Pool, everyone had the same feeling, that is, jumping into the hot spring to wash away the mud and dirt from the whole body. It was indeed very refreshing for a while, but after leaving here, it didn't take long for the whole body to be covered with mud and dirt again. Washing was equal to not washing. If you don't think that this is a historically famous site, you really want to shout "Oh no!"</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (35)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He looked up and saw, near the north, a deep and light gray shadow, which overwhelmed the sky and covered the sea, and was running towards them, as if it were a cloud falling from the sky.</p>
<p>He turned the boat around and, taking advantage of the tailwind, rushed straight to the embankment. The fog chased behind him and soon caught up. When it caught up with the Pearl, it surrounded her heavily, so thick that nothing could be seen; a chill passed through Pierre's limbs, as well as the smell of smoke and mold mixed together, a strange smell of sea fog, which made him close his mouth to avoid tasting this wet and cold dense cloud. When the boat returned to its original position near the dock, the whole city was already buried in this fine water vapor, which did not fall down, but moistened everything like rain, and slipped over the houses and streets like a flowing river.</p>
<p>Pierre, whose hands and feet were frozen, hurried home, fell on the bed, and wanted to take a nap before dinner. When he woke up and went to the dining room, his mother was saying to Jean:</p>
<p>"That aisle will be decorated very beautifully. We can put some flowers there. You see. I will take care of and change those flowers for you. If you have any banquets, this will look exceptionally gorgeous."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" the doctor asked.</p>
<p>"Talking about a very good house that I just rented for your brother. It's really not easy to find, a house located on the second floor, with doors to two streets. There are two living rooms, a glass-embedded corridor, a small circular dining room, this house is very beautiful for a boy to live in."</p>
<p>Pierre turned pale. A surge of anger choked his heart.</p>
<p>"Where is this house?" he asked.</p>
<p>"On Frangso I Avenue."</p>
<p>He had no more questions, he sat down, so enraged that he almost wanted to shout: "Is everything going to be his!"</p>
<p>His mother continued triumphantly:</p>
<p>"And think about it, I only spent two thousand eight hundred francs on the rent. This house was originally rented for three thousand francs a year, but I promised to rent it for three years, six years or nine years, so it's two hundred francs cheaper every year. Your brother will definitely be very happy living there. A lawyer will get rich as long as the house is beautiful. Because a beautiful house can attract customers, seduce them, keep them, make them respect, and make them know that the person living in such a house speaks naturally at a high price."</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, and said again:</p>
<p>"We also have to find a house similar to this for you, which is naturally much simpler than this, because you have nothing, but it must also be quite lovely. I can assert that a suitable house is very useful for you."</p>
<p>Pierre replied nonchalantly:</p>
<p>"Ah! I, I will succeed by working hard and studying."</p>
<p>His mother stubbornly said:</p>
<p>"That's right, but I can assert that a beautiful house is very useful for you."</p>
<p>Halfway through the meal, he suddenly asked:</p>
<p>"How did you get to know him, this Maraisha?"</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>"Humor" and "Slapstick"</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Private advocacy of "humor," public praise for "slapstick," these are two outlets for the pent-up frustration of ordinary people in "the face of national crisis," 丨 丨 in short, they are anesthetics.</p>
<p>Some say that it is certainly not good to be gloomy, and the production of humor has its own role, which is not wrong; but once a solemn matter is shrouded in the cloak of humor, it is difficult to see the truth of the facts clearly, and once it flows into the hands of slapstickers, there is only laughter. The harm it causes is generally similar.</p>
<p>For example, "capturing Japanese alive" is certainly a happy topic: but once performed by a clown, this meaning is no different from "capturing Zhang San alive." Similarly, "crying for Sun Yat-sen" is originally a very painful topic, but it is suitable to run straight to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and cry loudly, or hide at home and sob. If Wang Wu Neng and his like use the tune of "crying for Uncle Miao Gendu" and cry in a wailing voice, then the audience will intercept this tail of "entertainment technology" and leave behind the meaning of "crying." 丨 丨 In the eyes of the audience or listeners, Mr. Sun Yat-sen has also become "Uncle Miao Gendu II." This can be seen from the fact that in a survey of radio listeners, how many of them turned on the radio to commemorate Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Therefore, "humor" is the language of slaves, and "slapstick" is only an ornament for after-dinner conversation in a prosperous age. If you want to find a way out from humor, and hear "patriotic thoughts" from a little tune, then you will be disappointed like looking for white cloth in a dye vat.</p>
<p>But what is the truth of the two? It lies in reducing the vitality of individual struggle and anesthesia!</p>
<p>Living in the modern situation, everyone has resentment, and everyone needs entertainment. The surge of life force forces people to rush forward to fight for the things they want to obtain. But when rushing, it is inevitable to knock down the other party or hurt yourself. Smart people will think of these things. Therefore, those who originally wanted to rush, did not rush, and expressed it as humor, quietly standing far away from the enemy with tears in their eyes and throwing a small stone, hoping to hit the target by chance, without being noticed 丨 丨 Because if they are noticed, even this right will be revoked, so smart people become even smarter. 丨 丨 What about those who are about to be rushed? They quickly stood up to reward slapstick, the purpose of which is to puncture the gathered resentment with a needle, hoping that everyone will laugh and temporarily forget the pain they are carrying. The method is originally very clever, and it is one step further than humor.</p>
<p>As for the so-called "promoting patriotic thoughts" and "advocating national spirit," in short, it is not worth a penny, it is just a "smokescreen."</p>
<h3>Ward 20</h3>
<p>— Yu Sheng</p>
<p>Nature is showing a smile to the world, the warm sunshine is shining on the earth, all the flowers are stretching out their buds, the leaves of the mulberry trees are also getting smaller and larger, the people on the road are showing a harmonious and youthful spirit, and the tourists in the parks are coming and going like weaving. The birds are jumping and chirping on the branches, and the breeze is softening all the idle people. This is the most joyful season of life... Spring!</p>
<p>The hospital is a first-class imperial hospital, and most of the patients are wealthy merchants and dignitaries. There are also poor people, who only come after all the hospitals have declared them hopeless. The patients living in the first- and second-class wards usually do not have serious illnesses, but the third-class wards are different. There are those who are terminally ill, and those who are poor and have no support, especially in that dark corner, the cold Ward 20, which has always been reserved for patients who have been declared hopeless by the doctor and are about to disappear from the world.</p>
<p>Old and sick, what a terrible encounter in life! An elderly patient, said to be seventy-four years old, lived in Ward 20. He had no relatives at all. Because he had no money, he could only occupy the dirtiest corner of the entire hospital.</p>
<p>He lay on the white bed, constantly groaning, his thin face covered with wrinkles that had suffered from wind and frost. From every line of deep-set, dark wrinkles, he had engraved the infinite suffering and trauma of his past life experiences. His head of white hair stood straight up, and you could see that in his shattered heart, the bitterness and indignation that filled his chest were burning like fire. When he occasionally moved, his legs trembled very badly, showing that his decaying limbs could not only carry his body, but also his sorrow. He was never seen smiling, his smile seemed to have been destroyed long ago, and he was never seen visiting him. It seemed that this poor old man had already been forgotten by mankind.</p>
<p>Without the doctor's permission, he often drank very strong yellow wine. This action clearly showed that he was eagerly hoping to quickly end his remaining life. When someone asked about his life, he always glared at the person like a madman, and immediately showed a nameless resentment that squeezed into his heart. The wrinkles on his face almost all twitched, his lips trembled, and blood-like hot tears flowed from his dry eyes. As a result, no one could be so cruel to ask any further!</p>
<p>When the nurse buttoned his clothes for him, he always shed tears of gratitude as if he had been touched by a concern, sometimes simply crying out loud. He felt sad about the pain of being helpless in his old age, the sorrow of being old, poor, and sick. Under the decay of life functions and the attack of all kinds of sorrows, the old man's condition became worse day by day.</p>
<p>One evening, when the nurse went to measure his temperature, she found him lying stiffly on the bed, his hands and feet were already cold, there seemed to be a little heat in his chest, and undried tears were still hanging on his face. The ragged clothes were piled up in 丨 piece, and a broken wine bottle was thrown on the ground.</p>
<p>He finally destroyed himself, and died like a dream after being drunk. People carried him into the "morgue," and the "philanthropist" gave him a coffin for his last rest. The ragged clothes still accompanied him to that unknown and vast world, but the yellow wine would no longer accompany him. There was no turmoil of relatives and friends mourning, nor the crying of children. The warm sunshine shone on his thin coffin, and he got rid of all the sorrows and pains of the world and rested quietly and forever.</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>Two Dollars and Ninety-Six Cents</p>
<p>After my teacher Mr. X's funeral, I went for a mountain outing with my older brother and my friend Mr. Li. To make a living, we rush about outside all year round, and we've been estranged from the scenery of the mountains and fields for a long time. Naturally, we wouldn't let this opportunity pass easily.</p>
<p>Although the sky was drizzling, our interest in visiting the mountains and forests did not diminish at all. In the morning, we chewed on many hot, steaming flatbreads (how delicious these flatbreads are, it's been many years since they touched my lips). Then, we rolled up our trousers, held up umbrellas, and walked out of the east gate.</p>
<p>The twenty-odd li walk didn't feel like much of a burden to us. The splashing raindrops didn't make us feel the slightest bit annoyed either. Perhaps we were tired of the city. We felt that the countryside truly had an indescribable sense of intimacy.</p>
<p>I can't say how much the scenery in the rain pleased our spirits. I think it would be more accurate to say that it increased our emotions more so than pleasure. At that time, we were standing on the seventh floor of a temple outside the east gate, gazing at the semi-circular horizon. We all unconsciously sank into memories. The unspoken silence lasted for several hours.</p>
<p>When we were panting as we walked down the stone steps one by one, we realized that it was past noon, and our stomachs were starting to demand food. So, we rushed into the city and randomly found a restaurant on the street.</p>
<p>I examined the decoration of the restaurant. Hanging on the walls were all Western paintings in glass frames. There weren't any Chinese-style calligraphy and painting screens. I felt like I was somewhere else, because I always thought that the shops in my hometown would usually hang screens and couplets of local elders. However, the hometown has changed. My mood is inevitably too old-fashioned.</p>
<p>In hunger, we devoured many dishes without knowing how much. The flavor of our hometown made the wanderers feel very appropriate, and we were intoxicated.</p>
<p>When we were paying the bill, we discovered that a small bowl of fried shrimp cost as much as 96 cents of silver dollars. We, who were unfamiliar with the prices, couldn't help but stare in astonishment. Later, according to the explanation of the shop assistant, we understood:</p>
<p>It turned out that not long ago, a clerk from a Shanghai bank came back to his hometown. He happened to order a bowl of fried shrimp at a restaurant. Unexpectedly, that day coincided with a wealthy family holding a wedding banquet, and all the shrimp in the city had been bought up. The restaurant couldn't fulfill the order, so the bank clerk became angry and decided to use "foreign money" to compete. The cook finally managed to get a small bowl of shrimp. The bank clerk felt he had face and rewarded him with 96 cents. From then on, the price of fried shrimp in our hometown was set at 96 cents.</p>
<p>I think that clerk who "benefited his fellow villagers" deserves to be praised, so I wrote it down as follows.</p>
<h3>"Jianghu Art"</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Among them, we single out the "Jianghu performers" who "make a living by selling skills." They beat gongs and drums in the streets and alleys, practice boxing, wield sticks, and perform some "tricks" to attract cheers from ignorant people, women and children, in order to earn money for food. We call this kind of life skill "Jianghu art."</p>
<p>The art of “Jianghu performers” becoming a life skill naturally has its unique and profound aspects. For example, they beat gongs and drums to gather spectators, making the noise as loud and grand as possible. The more spectators that are attracted, the better. Then, they deliver an eloquent opening speech, saying that they have traveled to the north and south capitals and all over the five lakes and four seas, to show that they have a deep origin and extraordinary background. They then brag about how they know the "kung fu" of thirty-six levels and the "changes" of seventy-two sets, to show how they have the ability to "steal the sky and change the day" and "reverse the universe". "The three religions and nine streams," they claim, "all belong to me." Needless to say, they speak eloquently and talk logically. After being "publicized", the spectators are happy to "open their wallets". This requires two or more people to "help out", with one blowing and the other praising, echoing each other, so that you are influenced and dazzled without realizing it. After the prelude is over, the main act begins. However, it is often not so easy. First, they need money. After all, the "tricks" are for the sake of money. Once the money is in hand, it may be a fully armed fight, with broadswords swinging and a fierce battle where you can't tell who's winning or losing. When the "war" is at its most intense, the "spectators" have to throw money. After the event, no matter who wins or loses, the two sides have already "reached an agreement", and the spectators throw money. Then, there may be unpredictable "illusions". Whether it is civil or military, it can be ugly or evil. Under the "clear sky and bright sun", many turtles, scorpions, snakes, and insects can be produced out of thin air. Whether the change is good or bad, because they can change, the "spectators" throw money. If the "spectators" are a little bored or annoyed, there must be stimulation. Suddenly, a child is beheaded, and a sharp blade enters the chest – it is a bloody tragedy. This can greatly intimidate. "Everyone has parents, and everyone has siblings." Where justice lies and where humanity is concerned, "if you have money, throw it, if you don't have money, throw it." You are not allowed to leave. When the money is gone and the bag is empty, the show is over. However, the "trick" is not over. It can be performed again at a different time and place.</p>
<p>However, "each trick has its own method, and each master has his own teaching." The "tricks" of this kind of "Jianghu art" can be performed falsely or truly. It can be performed in the sound of gongs and drums, or in the sound of cannons and bombs. It can be performed in the streets and alleys, or it can be performed on a larger scale, such as the province and the country. The size of the "trick" is different, and the amount of money the "spectators" throw is also different.</p>
<p>This kind of ability to speak eloquently, followed by gun and knife fights, ever-changing illusions, and killing and bloodshed to deceive "spectators" into throwing money is indeed a unique aspect of Chinese "Jianghu art." It still manages to coax ignorant people, women, and children into throwing money without complaining. Perhaps it is because its "publicity" is moving, the fighting is very good to watch, the changes are unpredictable, and the killing and bloodshed are truly shocking. Otherwise, it would be known as a scam and rejected. In fact, who doesn't know it is a scam? Knowing it and still being willing to bite the bullet and be fooled is either because the Chinese nation is easily deceived, or because it has its own inferior nature of slaves. This is indeed a matter that cannot be solved with all the thinking!</p>

<p>Collaboration of Xiang Ning, Hong Wei, Man Qing, and Da Qian</p>
<p>Played, or the scope of the province and the country can also perform, the size of "tricks" different, "spectators" take money is different.</p>
<p>This kind of ability to say eloquent, followed by gun knife fighting, ever-changing, killing bloodshed to cheat "spectators" take money, is indeed a unique place in Chinese "Jianghu art". It is until now also coaxed a general ignorant people women and children take money without complaint, fear that it "propaganda" has a moving place, fighting is very good to look, change ghosts and gods unpredictable, and killing bloodshed is also really amazing, otherwise it will be known to be a scam and rejected. In fact, who does not know is a scam, knowing it and being willing to bite the bullet and be fooled, the reason is that the Chinese nation is easily deceived, or it has its own slave inferior nature, this is indeed a thing that can not be solved by all thinking!</p>
<h3>Waking Up from a Dream</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>Although I grew up in Shanghai, I often feel the boredom of life in this big city and curse it, because it has an atmosphere that makes people feel tired and irritable, attacking me powerfully. Therefore, I dream of going to the countryside, thinking of becoming a hardworking, leisurely, and happy farmer! At that time, I would climb trees to pick mulberry leaves to feed silkworms; personally take a hoe to cultivate seedlings, weed, and fertilize. In my spare time, I would happily read Tang poetry, taking poetry as my friend and using my own labor to solve my own livelihood. This is the most gratifying thing. And unexpectedly, be alarmed.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no noise of paddlewheels, no glare of electric lights. There is no bragging, no flattery, no charming winks, no treacherous hearts or faces... What you see is green mountains, green water, the gurgling of springs, the chirping of birds, simplicity, and faithfulness... Ah! The vast beauty of nature!</p>
<p>But people in such an ideal and fulfilling place have all run to this city full of an atmosphere that makes people feel thin and irritable. This should surprise me to the utmost! I asked them, and they said that they plow in the spring and cultivate in the summer, harvest in the autumn and store in the winter, going out with a hoe under the stars and returning tired with the moon. They work hard all year round, exposed to rain and sun, steamed by heat and invaded by cold, without any rest. The farmwives manage the household, cook and mend clothes, and also carry babies on their backs to deliver food to the men in the fields. They keep the plum rains, pick mulberry leaves to raise silkworms, from picking cocoons to reeling silk and weaving silk, from planting cotton to spinning and weaving cloth, and also raise pigs and chickens, all of which are the work of the farmwives. But what is the result? Those who eat white rice from the bowl are not the farmers, and those who wear silk all over their bodies are not the silkworm-raising women. Not only that, but they also said that even though they plant the fields themselves, they are still not full. If this continues, they will undoubtedly become hungry ghosts! When I heard their words, I couldn't help but shudder. I woke up from my dream a little. Then, a few lines of poetry about depicting the suffering of farmers and silkworms flew into my memory:</p>
<p>"In February, they sell new silk, in May, the county slaughters new sheep; to cure the sores before your eyes, you cut out the flesh from your heart! Weeding the seedlings at high noon, sweat drips into the soil, who knows that every grain in the bowl is the result of hard work! Yesterday I entered the city, returning with tears in my eyes; those who wear silk, are not the silkworm raisers. Ninety-nine eighty-one, the poor man has finished his punishment: only then can he lie down to sleep, mosquitoes and fleas come out!"</p>

<h3>[Fragmented Memories of Childhood (10)&gt;</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>Xiang Da was indeed Xiang Da, because he had herded cattle for three years, so he had learned a hundred or so mountain songs. He often argued with the cattle-herding children across the river. He won nine out of ten arguments. However, he showed me extra affection. Besides always sharing the fruit he stole from other people's back gardens with me, he also always took care of me, teaching me mountain songs. Sometimes I would also share some candy with him. All the candy was stolen from my mother's cupboard. My mother didn't give me much candy to eat in front of her. To eat candy, I had to steal it. Xiang Da ate the candy and said it was so sweet it went straight to his heart. From then on, he was even nicer to me.</p>
<p>After that, he taught me how to swim. He said he would first show me an example. So, he took off his shorts, did a somersault into the water, and swam two or three hundred times. I felt dizzy watching him. He also said that he was teaching me how to breathe underwater. As a result, I almost drowned in the water when I imitated him. He quickly pulled me out of the water, carried me to the hillside, and slapped my back with all his strength until I spat out a lot of water. After a long time, he said, "It's still not working. You have to use more strength!" As soon as I heard this sentence, I opened the cattle pen door. The yellow cow rushed out and almost knocked me down under its crotch.</p>
<p>I remember that although I was ten years old at that time, I wasn't as tall as the average ten-year-old child. If the yellow cow raised its head, I was only as tall as its lower jaw. Usually, I was five inches shorter than its spine. But this yellow cow was very kind. It didn't bully me because I was young. It just followed my short steps step by step under the restraint of the halter. Sometimes it showed a tired look and neighed a few times. If it stopped, you knew it must be defecating, otherwise it wouldn't do that.</p>
<p>I had already led the yellow cow out of the firewood gate, and my mother still rushed forward to urge me, "It's good enough to lead it to the hillside or the paddy fields to graze, but don't take it to the pond!" Naturally, the motive behind my mother's words wasn't the cow, but she was deeply afraid that I would play in the water and accidentally fall into the pond. There was no chance of coming back alive. The day before yesterday, He Xiazi gave me a fortune reading, saying that I had a water barrier in my life, especially in July, I had to be careful. My mother believed his words more than making a wish to the Bodhisattva of Mercy. She often said that he was a great fortune teller who answered every question and whose words were reliable, telling me not to play around, especially to be careful in July.</p>
<p>Not to mention my father and mother, even my eldest brother, who didn't get along with me very well, praised me, saying, "You never see any progress in your studies, but herding cattle is your specialty. The skinny yellow cow will get fat after you herd it for a few days. In the future, ask Dad to buy you a load of grain candy to eat!" This was a big talk that my eldest brother often said, and he seemed to have said it several times before. My eldest brother's words weren't very reliable, I understood in my heart, but I was also happy to hear these kinds of words.</p>
<p>After ten days, I met Xiang Da behind the mountain. He was also a cattle herder, but the cow he herded belonged to other people, not his own family's. He was two years older than me. When summer came, he wouldn't wear a shirt, sticking out his chest, bare skin, basking in the scorching sun. By the end of July, when most of the summer had passed, his skin would be tanned into a spicy sauce color with red inside black. Water would drip on it without leaving a trace, like mercury, it would disappear in a flash.</p>

<p>Movie Supplement</p>
<h3>For Movie Criticism</h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen several articles on movie criticism. Some expressed dissatisfaction with the current formulaic, mechanized, and vulgar movie criticism, and some explained that what is most needed now is constructive criticism. Of course, the motivation of these words is to improve movie criticism and to promote Chinese movie culture. Following the transformation of the entire film industry, I think the proposal of this view and requirement is justified.</p>
<p>Sun Yu once said that movie criticism is a specialized subject, and critics must fully study criticism before they can point out whether the work is correct or not. Only in this way can the authority of the critic be established. At the same time, Fei Mu also said that critics have neglected the criticism of film techniques too much, so they have not been of much help to producers other than indicating consciousness. We admit that these are all essential admonitions to movie critics. Without sufficient knowledge of the film production process, movie critics will forever remain in the circle of conceptual criticism.</p>
<p>Yes, critics need to know the film production process, the overview and evolution of the film industry in various countries around the world, and the relationship between films and audiences. In other words, a very difficult and arduous task is placed before movie critics.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in order to fulfill the cultural mission of movie criticism, film critics should bravely take on this task. They should not regard rushing to see movies and rushing to write articles as their only duties. They should learn more from books, magazines, studios, and even movie theaters.</p>
<p>Here, for the sake of movie criticism, critics want to make some urgent hopes to all those who cooperate with the film industry.</p>
<p>After reading many conversations of artists, it is gratifying to know that they have already expressed a very friendly attitude towards critics. Here, we further hope that producers and critics will have further cooperation. In addition to books and magazines, critics also need a lot of practical materials, because their research, their exploration, and even their correct and scientific criticism, must have the supply of this practical information before they can be completed. You see when foreign film critics criticize a film, they not only criticize the entire work, but also analyze the composition of all the pictures, the length of each cut, and the number of words in the dialogue and subtitles, … and other substantial issues. I think that conscientious film artists, if they sincerely hope for the progress of Chinese cinema, will certainly not be stingy with this meaningful cooperation.</p>

<h3>"A Thousand Mile Fate" Review of The Man From Toronto</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>In many literary criticisms in the past, it has been pointed out that British films and American films do not have absolutely different places in essence. Their difference is only a small difference in the way of expression. This argument, we now look at "A Thousand Mile Fate", has been more of an evidence.</p>
<p>"A Thousand Mile Fate" is nothing more than a dispute between men and women, and in this, even more serious events are not available. Some are just small comedies, and small storms, he mocked the man's seeing different thoughts, he mocked the girl's impatience, so!</p>
<p>In the current society in Europe and the United States, in addition to providing entertainment for gentlemen and serving them, movies are almost only a function of exerting techniques for all artists themselves. Therefore, they absolutely do not ask how meaningful the story is. They know that the story is simple and can command the technique as much as possible. They intentionally take this "small storm" and "small comedy" as the theme. Originally, they could do nothing but some small techniques.</p>
<p>In this "A Thousand Mile Fate", the director also completely focused on the fun, (the two words fun, in the past easy to make people recognize as funny jokes, in fact, can not adopt this narrow sense of understanding.) He is a scene, and then another scene, a shot after another shot, to describe what he wants to express, he is not afraid of trouble to narrate small things.</p>
<p>However, one point we admit that "A Thousand Mile Fate" is clever, is that no matter where, the director can always use all kinds of side lining to express the psychology of children. This is natural, because the director's life is determined by the environment, he is familiar with this place. Therefore, in this film, whether the male or female lead, can delicately express the children's "good tricks", curiosity, competitive, within and their weak will. The importance of this kind of life experience in local art is clearly illustrated. Especially our directors who want to shoot films for the farmers and workers, and the actors who want to perform the attitudes of the farmers and workers, should pay more attention to it!</p>
<p>The most ambitious masterpiece of Lionel Barrymore's life, "Who Toiled for Whom," will be screened in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Audience Comments</p>
<h3>"Western Arabian Nights" After Viewing</h3>
<p>— Shen Gong</p>
<p>In the modern film world, there is a cry for transformation, but there is a work like "Western Arabian Nights", which is a pity!</p>
<p>The naivete of consciousness is revealed in a white light and a black air, and the various absurdities are no less than the Journey to the West and the List of Gods and other kinds of gods and monsters. This is not only contrary to the purpose of film education, but also instills corrupt ideas into the minds of the general public, making the superstitious people more confused by the sayings of gods and monsters. I think this kind of work is really without the value of shooting.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, all kinds of deformed costumes have made me feel cold, and the great chieftain palace that the filming work boasts is simply a set of utensils for Taoists to do Taoist temples. Not only can it not show that it is the chieftain's palace, but it also reveals the director's shortcomings.</p>
<p>As for the poor performance of several word recruitments, it is even more annoying, even using both hands to slap on the subtitles, and after the trial screening does not modify, it is even more visible that this film is sloppy!</p>
<h3>My Opinion on "Aladdin"</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Indeed, "Arabian Nights" is a very interesting book, and the section of "The Story of the Magic Lamp" can especially arouse the interest of many people. But I think that making this story into a film is undoubtedly going to fail.</p>
<p>Even if you discard the consciousness, there are many absurdities that are overlooked by the director. For example, in the section where Aladdin dies, Aladdin is in the same place as a native, Aladdin dies and the native does not die, who would believe how the fire only burns Aladdin, and does not burn the native? There are many such improprieties, and at the end, the same old problems are revealed, and this kind of performance is far less than the description in the original book.</p>
<p>As for the actors in this kind of work that is not suitable for the times, it is impossible to please them in any way. Wang Chunyuan too much shows the attitude of a monster, and the palace lord played by Qian Siying seems like the characters said in the old novels, and the clothes also do not know what they are based on, there are many that are not Chinese and not Western.</p>
<p>In short, the film "Aladdin" is really a white fee and a thankless effort!</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin Readies Himself Again</h3>
<p>— Rowan</p>
<p>It has been a long time since we saw Charlie Chaplin's "City Lights," and he seemed like a figure weary of the silver screen. But now, suddenly, news of Charlie's re-emergence has come from Hollywood.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin is indeed a peculiar figure in Hollywood. He started his own Chaplin Film Company, writes his own scripts, directs himself, acts as the main actor, and produces his own films. He makes one or two films whenever he pleases, and when he is not pleased, he closes the doors and rests. This time, he has rested for two years and ten months.</p>
<p>What has Chaplin been doing during these two years of rest? During this long period of two years and ten months, he did not spend many days resting and doing nothing. He wrote at home every day. No one knows why, but he actually took up the life of a poor scholar, which most people find baffling.</p>
<p>Chaplin's long work of over two years has now been completed. The book is titled "A Retrospective of the Film Industry," and it has now been published by a major publisher in New York. After completing his work, Chaplin will take a short rest and then reorganize his old business. The doors of the Chaplin Film Company's studio will soon be open again.</p>
<p>This time, Chaplin will still be making a silent film, and like "City Lights," it will still abandon dialogue and intersperse it with other types of sounds.</p>
<h3>News from the Club of Employees of Lianhua Factories One and Two</h3>
<p>The second session of the supervisory and executive committees of the Lianhua Shanghai Factories One and Two Employees' Club was elected by the general assembly a few days ago.

<h3>Film Novel Woman's Weakness My Weakness (9)</h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>Ronald argued with him, "That won't do. You're a rich man now, not a newspaper boy anymore!" Illery said, "If I marry her, she won't necessarily still be a floor-scrubbing maid! Ronald, she's too good. No matter what you say! I'm determined to marry her." Ronald asked, "What about Chinny?" Illery said, "That's over. I don't even know why I liked her before. I don't understand why I listened to her. She's really a woman who strikes gold from men. Ronald, I notified the bank this morning to continue paying your allowance as before."</p>
<p>Ronald's allowance, his uncle had instructed the bank to continue paying! Wasn't that still Lolo's merit? Even if he didn't love her, he wouldn't forget her. How should he repay her? He should make her happy. Ronald was thinking when Lolo opened the door and came out. Illery exclaimed, "My little angel is here!" Lolo smiled slightly, weakly shaking her head and saying, "You two, please come to my room, I have something to say to you... Mr. Gregory, you are a kind and generous person, and I like you very much, but that's all. If I were the kind of woman who would marry you, think about it, how much better would I be than Chinny?" His head lowered, lost in regretful thought. Lolo took his hand and said, "You are truly a good man. Why don't you find someone closer to your age who truly loves you?" Illery raised his head and smiled at her, "Perhaps you're right, little baby. But I still hope you're wrong." Ronald laughed, "What she says makes a lot of sense."</p>
<p>Because Ronald was still smirking, Lolo turned around and said angrily to him, "You, you need reform ten times more than I do! I used to think that it was okay for a poor woman to marry a man for money and comfort. Now I know that's not enough. It's not enough for a man to just be good-looking. Take you for example, you could have been a good person, but you are too selfish and heartless. You are also the laziest. Why don't you work and do something for your uncle Illery? Even Gilat is better than you. As for myself, I am grateful for all the education you have given me in the past two months. I now understand everything about men. I don't want to marry any man anymore."</p>
<p>After Lolo finished speaking, she lowered her head again to tidy her clothes. She heard the sound of Illery walking out. She thought Ronald was also going to leave. But after waiting for a while, Ronald didn't leave. He said to Lolo, "Lolo, what you said about me needing to work is not wrong. I now beg you to take me as your personal slave. What do you say?" This seemed too good to be true. Lolo was a little skeptical, she was still tidying her clothes. Ronald said again, "During the day, I'll work in Illery's office. In the evening, I'll come back and work for you." Lolo still ignored him. He said again, "Lolo, why don't you use a useful young man? If you're willing to use me, I'll immediately hang up all your clothes for you!" All right, stop pretending, suddenly Lolo inexplicably found herself in Ronald's arms. (The End)</p>
