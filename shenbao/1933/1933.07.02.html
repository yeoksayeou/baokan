<p>立法院設立憲法起草委員會後。主稿人竟在此國難嚴重中。埋頭起草初稿近且見諸報章。繼之以各家評述。毁譽參雜。議論紛紛。國勢危如纍卵。而博學多士。獨能專心於此。斷斷爭辨。豈亦有感於「憲法救國」之說耶。本報於斯。不敢有所主張。或有責之者。其亦類於責夏蟲之不肯語冰乎。</p>
<p>夫制憲爲國家之大政。法國自一七八九年至一八七五年。頒憲凡十次。自革命肇初至督政時期。制憲專家西愛咸斯輒躬與其事。其書桌上盈盈皆憲法草案也。然而讀孝經不足以退賊。徒制憲法。能避免當時法國政治之紊亂與恐怖乎。憲史先例。斑可稽。故欲藉憲法以救危亡。能否成功。殊不敢必。乃今時論。徒斤斤於制憲技術之長短。而於制憲之先决問題。獨皆略而不提捨重就輕。急其所緩。斯則不能令人無疑者。</p>
<p>時論之評憲法草案也。有責政府「不以隆重形式特聘專家設會起草。而以責諸政府機關官吏性質之立法院」者。有責以「三民主義分編。在立法技術上成極拙劣之章制」者。有責以不應稱「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」者。其所質難。固亦言之成理。然欲爲該草案作辯護士。亦殊易易。昔拿破侖命包達里。戴隆雪。皮果特潘墨濃。馬勒勒維四人直草民法典。指四人而叮嚀曰。「予給汝輩以六個月之功夫。爲予制成一民法典。一四人唯唯退。各在拿翁鞭策下。競謀通融合作。而民法典卒底於成。頒行至今。百年矣。顧念當時。拿翁亦何嘗有隆重之形式乎。是制法不在形式之隆重。而在乎實質之效能而已。此可以爲草案初稿護者一也。憲法章制。非一成不變之物。立法技術。亦非呆板不能通融之道。法國一八七五年之憲法。分割瑣碎。成體統遑論章制。德國威馬憲法精細無出其右。又與過去各種憲章逈異。而蘇俄憲法。尤獨闢蹊徑。古典派憲法學者。引爲駭事。則以三民主義分編。亦無足異。且目的論之分編法。勝於形式論之分編法。言之亦殊成理。此可以爲草案初稿辯護者二也。至稱中華民國爲三民主義共和國。更非創例。蘇俄稱「蘇維埃社會主義俄羅斯聯邦共和國。」即其明證。此更可爲草案初稿辯護者三也。至若其餘爭點。各有見地。说稿人容有所蔽。旁觀者淸。自能指示其瑕庛。夫理以愈辯而愈明。品長評短。學者之責。固無所用其意氣也。惟制憲論戰之士。皆注意於制憲技術之長短。而忽略千百倍重要於制憲技術之先决問題。則吾人不能無言。</p>
<p>制憲之先决問題爲何。曰憲法之生命。不在立法家之掌握。而在推行憲法者之掌握。若立法家之責任。能内參民族之精神。外酌世界之潮流。務使憲法之草案。成爲民族需要莫切之映照。即已極盡其能事至若如何使用憲法推行而無阻。行之而有效。如何使憲法演成活的生命。而不致淪爲死的具文。立法家雖極聰明才智。亦無從爲之解决。蓋立法家之任務。僅限於技術。而如何能推行盡利。則惟負運用政治之責者是賴。昔德儒蕯維尼認法律與立法家之關係爲「技術要素。」法律與國民生活之關係爲「政治要素。」認政治要素重於技術要素。其說雖亦不免有抹煞成文法價値之流弊然而法律實際之效能。必須重視。此則一般人所公論也。</p>
<p>按憲法之。實際效能。不僅在立法技術之切合實際需要。旦須有制憲之濃厚興味。制憲之濃厚興味爲何。曰爭憲之運動是也。歐美憲政之發展。往往以國民之自奮爲原動力。國民流血奮鬭。前仆後繼。經長時期之抗爭始獲制憲之權力。於是國民視憲如寳。人人具有護憲之心。政府自不敢生毁憲之意德儒伊耶陵嘗言。「未嘗奮鬭而得之法律。猶在街沿所拾之迷途兒不足爲貴苟其自生。而欲在母親襁褓中奪爲己有。則母親必將咆哮而不肯罷休。」旨哉斯言。今之論憲者亦已認識斯醞釀中之憲法。爲人家遺失之迷途兒耶抑爲母親襁褓中之愛子耶。斯一問題而未解决。則一切技術問題之討論。無非枉費口舌而已。</p>
<p>今試返顧吾國之處境若何。國民之處境又若何。疆土日蹙。人口日減失業盈於城市。農村瀕於破產。水旱災禍。連綿不絶。内戰烽火。接踵而起盜匪充塞。捐稅繁重。人民圖保蟻命之不暇。遑論干政。更遑論權利之抗爭當局苦心謀國。雖大聲疾呼。欲以憲法求統一。救危亡。然其實爲統一之梗者惟少數軍閥與政客耳。若輩本以無法爲便。今欲以一紙憲章。獻於若輩求以是促成統一。殆亦等於與虎謀皮。夫吾國家制法。連篇累牘。早成巨帙而國家始終未收法治之效。國民亦始終未得實際之保障。而有力者則始終視法律如弁髦。明明有法可循。而必求之於法外。法律之效能微。國民自無守法之可能法律與社會。關係何等密切。今旣根本不能聯繫。則雖日日言制憲又將何補於實際乎。願今之諭憲者。對斯先决問題。其三致意焉。</p>

<p>經濟會議延會</p>
<p>靜待白宮覆音</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟會議之運命、經飄搖不定一日一夜後、今已擬有制止匯市暴漲落與保護金本位幣之最後方案、靜待美總統答復、據報紙電訊、此項提議美總統可認爲滿意、且已爲美國務副卿摩萊所接受、第尙待總統之核准耳、華盛頓消息謂美總統對於中央銀行之從事制止匯價漲落運動、未見有可以反對之處、但認暫時安定問題、與其視爲政府之責毋寗視爲此輩銀行職分内事、說者僉謂根據此項消息、美總統已在原則上贊同歐洲最後計劃矣、</p>
<p>此項計劃係英·法·意·荷·比·瑞士所草擬、並就商於摩萊、聞含有下列三點、</p>
<p>（一）前述諸國（連美國在内）發一聯合宣言、保證中央銀行合作、防止匯市投機的漲落、</p>
<p>（二）宣言内當鄭重申明不破壞金本位幣安定之重要、</p>
<p>（三）各國同意注重於贊同之世界經濟會議的目的、即最後恢復金本位是也、</p>
<p>現已商定一俟接到美總統正式同意後、英相麥唐納即邀各首席代表至唐寗街十號相邸簽署宣言、至宣言内措辭、聞將使美國仍可自由施行其貨幣政策、僅由各中央銀行出而與投機者宣戰、</p>
<p>萬一美國不願加入聯合宣言、則聞金本位國將組織一最堅强之　金集團、且不問在何種協定之下、金本位將聯合宣言保持其本位、</p>
<p>今日局勢非常緊張、即主席麥唐納亦深虞會議之决裂、聞麥氏刻正考慮邀全歐各外長外相於下星期内同來倫敦、加入擴大會議範圍加緊工作之運動、（三十日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c87">戰區接收步驟 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>接收委會成立後之先决問題</p>
<p>日本退兵及處置僞軍最重要</p>
<p>平訊、灤東問題雖至今尙未有具體確定之辦法、然步驟所在、日本退兵僅爲時間問題、　李際春等商議改編、亦必有其　行之方案、而接收戰區又爲目下當務之急、非由我方孟晋進行不可、故目下此間已有接收委員會之組織、並定於七月一日成立、</p>
<p>戰區爲河北省屬故接收上所應有之一切布置經費、胥由河北省府擔任之、接收委員會凡委員九人、于學忠爲委員長、以河北主席、應有指揮之責也、其次魏鑑、爲河北民政廳長、派充縣長咸由魏氏主持之、以上二人屬於省府、此外屬於政委會四人、薛之珩·李擇一·殷桐·劉石孫·屬於軍分會者二人、陶尙銘·雷壽榮·屬於交通方面者一人、錢宗澤、若以職務分配之最　者、莫若改編一事、則由于學忠·薛之珩·殷桐·雷壽榮·劉石孫·負較多之責任、其次接收則屬於魏鑑、交通屬於錢宗澤·劉石孫、指導縣長屬於陶尙銘·殷桐·一切接洽屬於李擇一、各盡其力、各稱其長、會所設於天津、會期以接收完畢之日爲止、接收委會之工作、大致如此也、</p>
<p>至九委員之略歷、則于爲主席、魏爲民政廳長、薛之珩爲北平警界耆宿、對於改編方面、可以效力者甚多、李擇一爲政委會秘會、殷桐爲士官學校畢業生、與何黃夙稱契好、劉石孫亦日本留學畢業生同爲政委會參議、陶尙銘久在東北任職、前東北之外交科長、雷壽榮亦士官畢業、爲參謀本部參謀、此次在軍分會供職、錢宗澤爲鐵道部次長、北寗隴海兩路局長、就中　殷劉二人、久已脫離宦海、此遭應徵而至、益足見其熱忱也、</p>
<p>接收委員會一經成立、即當進行接收、而接收之先决問題凡二端、（一）日本退兵、（一）李際者部之解决方案、若此二事就緒、則各縣長率警察以蒞任、嗣後一切不過行政上之問題而已、故此會名爲接收實則尤重要这職務、尙爲解决此先决事項也、關於日本退兵、原協定上未限日期、遂爾遷延、然目下前綫已經開始撤退、惟照軍事上言之、一方撤退、一方接防、實有互相銜接呼應之必要、故其預備接防者、必先知夫撤退者之程序、及其地點、溯自日兵聞始撤退以來、我方對其撤退之方案實未深知、故於接防上亦殊不便、夫日之與我若在戰鬭時間充其力量、儘可長驅乘勝入平而有餘、乃其計不出此、勒馬於懸崖者、亦正必有其未容入平、及未能持久戰爭之理由、迨至今日協定旣成、其爲得失、姑置不論、然旣有協定矣、又何必不使撤退之與接防步步銜接、以免甌脫之際陡生事端、惟在協定旣成之後、於今匝月、對於對方撤兵之步驟、旣未細容研究、則對於我方之接防、亦是無從懸擬方案、今之接收委員會欲圖接收、此其入手之第一義也、</p>
<p>至李際春部隊、接洽至今、爲編爲遣、但求於事有益、固無一定不可更變之方案、論其人數、號稱數萬、然據深知内幕者推測之、恐亦不過萬人、剿旣未能、自將謀撫、撫之之　、感爲改編、或爲資遣、此則當就其各部分之情况各别言之、但使能安然就範、爲國家服其公務、爲人民盡其捍衛、則改編亦未始不可之事、惟領袖若李際春者又將何以處置、使勿再多事、因之惟李際春之辦法决定、而日人退兵以後、始有由縣長接收之可能、此又委員會同時應行進行之要務也、</p>
<p>大亂之後、人民凋敝已極、各地治安極爲重要、且此十九縣乃不容駐兵者、匪患又不可不防、軍事旣無機關、則一切均在行政方面、而行政親民之官莫若縣長故省府業已遴選能賢、分任縣長、然此十九縣即實行接收矣、接收之時與接收之後、均不得不有特别注意之事項、應由接收者分别指導之、俾不致因小不忍而亂大謀、重苦人民、引起糾葛、故接收委員會於指導此十九縣特殊情况特殊環境下之縣長、亦一重要之任務也、（六月廿九日瀟）</p>

<p>馬暫留滬辦理善後</p>
<p>希望國内團結一致</p>
<p>午后訪晤馬相伯氏</p>
<p>新任軍事委員會委員馬占山將軍、由贛返滬後、昨晨十時、在漢口路惠中旅社、延見各報社記者、馬氏表示在滬約有月餘之勾留、俟部屬及歸國難民等善後問題、辦理完竣後、或將北上一行、並歷述此次赴贛謁蔣經過、及今後之主後之主張行止、茲分誌馬氏談話於次、</p>
<p>謁蔣經過馬氏首謂、余此次赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、一爲報告東北過去情形、一係商洽辦理部屬等之善後問題、結果頗爲圓滿、蔣委員長對於善後辦法、决先將所部各旅、報告中央、由中央派員往北平點騐、然後再將部隊改編、其次則調查入關之難民及眷屬、呈報中央、再謀救濟、入關之難民及眷屬大半分居於上海·北平·新疆·三處、本人現已派員赴平、調查確數、及眷屬之家長是否主存、或已陣亡、或已受傷、上海方面、亦已開始調查、新疆方面、現已派吳德林旅長前去視察、　　抗日不變本人此次在贛、觀察剿匪軍事之精神甚佳、贛匪不難肅淸、至抗日問題、本人主張、始終不變、一切悉聽中央命令、惟抗日須先有相當準備、及整個計畫、故與剿匪軍事不同、故令後抗日工作、應仍繼續從培養實力方面努力、</p>
<p>無意主新外傳本人將任新疆省政府主席一節余此次在南昌時、蔣委員長對此問題、確曾談及、余以所屬善後諸端、急待辦理、故未作如何表示、至中央委任本人爲軍事委員會委員一職、亦祇見報章、未奉到正式任命、但余個人志願、除繼續抗日貫澈初衷外、目下無意担任其他政務、</p>
<p>對馮表示記者旋詢以對馮玉祥此次在張垣之行動、感想如何、馬謂馮氏抗日宗旨、本人絶對表示同情、蓋以余之主張、素主抗日、可謂彼此站在一條戰綫之上、惟假如有人利用日名義、而别有懷抱、則當然不能贊同、所謂人心不同、各如其面、不得而知矣、至鄧文·李海靑·現下在察情形、未接報告、無從懸測、</p>
<p>戰區感想余返滬後、曾參觀閘北·江灣·吳淞·各地戰區、深覺日軍之殘暴、　較施諸東北者、更爲殘酷、創鉅痛深、觸目驚心、惟東北與淞滬戰役、就我國損失言、上海因都市關係、建築物燬壞無餘、東北則人民屠殺一空、然其表現敵人之殘暴則一、洵舉世之公敵也、</p>
<p>不赴南洋至日報載、本人將赴南洋募捐之說、係屬不確、蓋當在南昌之時、曾唔許世英先生、談及救濟東北難英先生、談及救濟東北難民、及其他救濟情形時、口頭有此一說蓋本人當時對許先生表示、此後願爲慈善事業服務、故遂有此說、但非謂親赴南洋募捐云、</p>
<p>印度前車馬氏最後答記者問、表示西南與中央之隔膜、希望、能速設法消弭、蓋因吾人在此國破家亡之危險時期、應迅速團結、澈底醒悟、始有可救之道、當余自歐洲回國、道經印度、即有一種感觸、蓋印度亦一大民族、與我相同、而印度於亡國之後、其内部紛爭、依然存在、此與我國現形相較、不免有類似之危險、故余對西南與中央相隔膜、認爲應由大家澈底覺悟、則國家前途、始有希望、否則難免不蹈印度之前轍也、</p>
<p>在滬暫留馬氏又稱、本人此次返滬、其唯一任務、乃在辦理所屬善後問題、故本人在滬約有月餘之勾留、俾資專事辦理善後事宜、俟辦竣後、或將北上一行、至蘇炳文氏、現因探視其夫人及公子等、已赴杭、何日返滬、刻尙未定云、</p>
<p>訪馬相伯馬氏於昨日午餐後、十二時四十五分、偕張殿九同車往徐家匯路馬相伯公館、訪晤九四老人、當面答謝馬老對其以前在東北抗日時所予之言論、與精神上之援助、三人晤談約一小時、馬氏對抗日情形、陳述頗詳、馬老亦盛稱其英名愛國、旅與馬氏合攝一影、以留紀念、馬張二氏辭出後、即轉赴法租界拜訪楊虎、談約半小時、復赴哈同花園略散步、至三時許、始回寓次、</p>

<p>申報月刋將於七月十五日出版之周年紀念特大號增加「中國現代化問題」特輯、而原有各欄文字，亦照常登載。其要目預告已於本報廣告欄披露，茲將該刋討論中國生產現代化問題之緣由錄後、用促國人對於生產問題之注意。</p>
<p>大刀與飛機坦克車抗爭，孰得孰失？人力車帆虹</p>
<p>船與汽車汽船比賽，孰快孰慢？用手搖紡車與新式紡織機紡紗織布，用　耙與新式曳引車耕田，其生產量孰多孰少？這雖是三尺孩童都能不假思索而回答的問題，但我們要注意，飛機，汽船，紡織機，曳引車，等等都是最近一二百年，在產業革命歷程中創造出來的工具，同時牠的影響將舊式的經濟，社會，和政治組織，也都改變了。現在產業先進國的生產工具與方法，早已「現代化」了，她們的社會組織，和以純粹農業手工業時代的情形也大不相同了。雖則她們現在的社會組織，缺陷很多，可是她們生產的「現代化」，却是一種進步的偉緽，誰也不能否認的。產業先進國的情形如彼。回頭看看我們中國的現狀，又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>我們中國，生活程度，已低下到大部分人民逗留在半饑餓的狀况；對外防衛的實力，微弱到失地四省、而莫展一籌的地步！究其原因，還不是由於别的國家已經「現代化」了，而中國許許多多地方，仍舊故步自封，未能適應現代環境的緣故？所以近來國人，差不多個個都感覺到中國「現代化」的必要，而「中國現代化」也己成爲一般人的呼聲了。</p>
<p>的確，中國今後在經濟上唯一的出路，就是「現代化」，但是談到中國的現代化，就發生了有待討論的重要問題了。問題是；</p>
<p>（一）中國「現代化」約困難和障碍是什麽？要促進中國「現代化」，需要甚麽幾個先决的條件？</p>
<p>（二）中國「現代化」當採取那一個人主義的或社會主發？外國資本所促成的「現代化」；或國民資本所自發的「現代化」？又實現這種方式的步驟怎樣？</p>
<p>我們相信中國的前途，有賴於這兩項問題的解答，所以特地徵求國内若干　者的意見，作一回公開的討論。</p>
<p>在國難重的今日，我們討論這兩個問題，似乎太「好整以暇」了。實則「怎樣救中國的危亡」？「中國究竟往那裏前進」？乃是一切人心中積蓄已久的疑問？我們要提出這些問題，徵求諸家不同的意見，目的就是在以關於解答這疑問的種種材料貢獻於國人。並非好爲高論。也不是逃避現實。現在爲使大家明瞭我們提出這些問題的意思，不妨再簡單申說幾句中國的農村，目下已呈瀕於崩潰的現象，而工商彫敝，入超統計，去年　又已達到五萬五千餘萬　兩的紀錄。整個國民經濟破產的危險。已經迫於眉睫，爲甚麽一時尙無法挽救，换言之。中國產業至今尙未能「現代化」，其根本的原因，究竟安在　？因爲這是一個中國目下急切待决的問題，所以我們要提出第一項問題，徵求各家的意見。其次輓近兩世紀中，列國先後發生產業革命，經過了「現代化」的歷程，產生了現代資本主義的社會組織。這種組織，在目前又因全世界空前的經濟恐慌，破綻百出，正在那裏發生動搖。中國今後的「現代化」應當姑且走他們的老路，抑另尋新路？「作始也簡，將畢也鉅」，我們旣然提出了第一項問題，第二項問題，自然也不能不同時提出討論了。</p>
<p>本刋創刋以來，已及一周年。辱承讀者諸君的歡迎愛護，得以日益發展。這是使我們非常感激的。現在我們决於七月號的本刋中，彙集諸家對於上述兩問題的意見，　呈於讀者諸君之前，以稍盡酬答之誼，並作創刋一周年的紀念。</p>

<h3 id="c194">指導輿論 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>自有歷史以來，吾國輿論，可以說從來不曾上過軌道。士庶人總是口没遮攔，喜歡瞎說。天子的權力是多麽大！似乎誰也應該歌功頌德的。帝堯之世，天下太和，百九無事。壞壤父年八十餘，擊讓於道中。觀者曰，「大哉帝之德也！」壤父曰；「吾日出而作，日入而息，鑿井而飲，耕田而食，德於我哉！」此卽後世所傳之　壤歌、事見帝王</p>
<p>世紀。試想，帝堯之世，天下旣經「太和」，百姓又是「無事」而壤父意猶不滿，竟說什麽。帝何德於我哉」，似對帝堯加以誹謗。幸而帝堯仁聖，寛大爲懷；不然，壤父豈不危乎殆哉！道是輿論不上軌道的一樁故事。</p>
<p>周厲王時，輿論騰沸，他愈聽愈惱，所以想「防民之口」以「止謗」，然而結果亦等於零。這是他不會指首導輿論的緣故。</p>
<p>還有秦始皇之世，偶語者棄市。刑法雖不能不說訂得嚴厲已極、然而他不會指導輿論，仍何異揚湯止沸，的以國詐因之而斬。</p>
<p>降及淸季，淸廷定了九年預備立憲之議。所頒諭旨中有最精彩的一句，就是「庶政公諸輿論」。這不能不說是「大哉王言」了。可是因没有定出指導的方法，所以立憲尙未預備定妥，而淸朝天下已送在「輿論」之手！</p>
<p>略舉數事，已可證輿論實有指導的必要。至於怎樣指導，自愧是個笨伯，又没有成例可援，所以我不能一貢「芻　之見」了。詩經裏說；「不識不知，顧帝之則」。這是指導當時士庶的一句話，輿論當然也可包括在内。但是今非昔比，這　條原則已不適用。外國有没有指導輿論的妥善方法，我因没有出過洋，也不知道。總之，茲事體大，宜如何草擾條例。製爲成憲，則不能不有待於賢者。</p>

<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>黃浦江，嫩黃的水，歇斯底里地呌，野獸似的兵艦，睜圓了眼睛怒視着，大鋼砲張開雪亮的鋼口，對着江邊的和平神像獰笑。</p>
<p>掘河機拖長鐵辫子，露着鋼刀似的鐐牙，呑進了爛泥，又患了霍亂病似的吐到船裏去。</p>
<p>碼頭上，窒息的烟霧迷漫着，一朶朶黑梅花似的煤灰。飛到苦力們的身上；重量的木箱壓着肩，胳膊上跳起了老鼠般的栗子肉，一步挨一步地，爬上線一樣的跳板，晶瑩的汗珠，在背上賽跑了　　杭唷，杭唷的呼聲，好像一隻受了創傷的狼，在寂靜的午夜裏狂嘷着，眼眶裏滚着痛苦的淚，金頂的沙遜大厦，却昻着頭對他們笑。</p>
<p>從吳淞口外駛來的商船，游到碼頭邊噴着白沬，雖有許多苦工，爲它卸除了肚裏的重載，但它的長嘴巴裏，依舊嘘出黑色的熱氣，要減輕長途的旅行的疲憊似的。</p>
<p>鹹水妹吸着烟，大魚吹泡般吐出圓圓的，迷人的烟圈，妖媚的瞳子斜睨着，一羣白色的水手，蒼蠅見了臭肉似的飛攏來。</p>
<p>在張着靑紗傘一樣的街樹下，中國保姆帶着哈叭狗徘徊；幾個洋小孩，背了小木槍，吃着咖啡糖，愉快地跳躍着，摸海螺的江北苦孩，瞧着他們燦爛的綢衣，一種悲哀侵襲了純潔的童心了。他們苦笑着，把藍布大褂揩了一揩腿上的污泥，向十六舖那邊走去。</p>

<p>祗求膳宿不計薪金</p>
<p>在上海月賺五十元，是所謂吃大飯了；可惜妻子的買件衫褲，孩子買些糕餅，未可苛責浪費，加之自己的鬍鬚根一樣需要刮刮，銀行儲蓄，根本只是夢般空虚，天天彷佛給生活壓迫到不能稍稍活動欠伸；但你以爲這是可了嗎？</p>
<p>尤其上海好像一隻大飯桶，各地的人跑來尋飯吃，一萬人之中有那末一個至二個得捧着飯碗時；已被稱幸稱幸運者，一定，這幸運者更顧不了這碗飯的飯味如何？</p>
<p>職業所在擠破了！來者還如潮水一般，不用說，每况愈下，於是祗求膳宿，不計薪金的一天一天多起；換句話；祗要裝飽自己肚子。顧不了家中妻兒老小的隨手可抓！</p>
<p>社會有這種現象，當然恐怖；但··········</p>

<p>第十回聞語驚芳心封侯願渺聽歇現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>江氏看着姑娘這樣埀頭喪氣的樣子，倒有些莫明其妙，以爲桂枝到劉家去討丸藥的時候，受了人家什麽閑言閑語了。自己躺在坑上，就輕言細語的向桂枝道；我這病又不要什麽緊，誰敎你去討丸藥呢？碰了人家的釘子，這又該橛了小嘴了。桂枝道；我碰了誰的釘子？劉家媽可是第二句話也没說，一聽到我們說要丸藥，立刻就答應着拿出來了。江氏道；旣然是人家並没有得罪你，你爲什麽生氣呢？桂枝只管低了頭縫衣服，隨口答道；我心裏煩得很嗎。江氏道；一個人高興也罷，心裏類煩膩也罷，總是有個原因的，聽你的話，倒好像是無原無故的就煩起來了。桂枝道；當然是有緣由。江氏道；那爲着什麽？桂枝道；你别問我，你一問，我一說，心裏就更煩了。江氏聽說。心裏可就想着，這事情有些怪了，去的時候，還是高高興興的，爲什麽回來就橛着嘴。而且他又說劉家媽並没有把話行罪他，那究竟是爲着什麽呢？江氏心裏如此想着，當然也是兩隻眼睛，只管望了桂枝的臉，桂枝立定了主意，不開笑容，也不對母親說什麽，就是終日做出悶悶不樂的樣子。在當日，江氏自然是莫明其妙。可是過了兩日，桂枝還是這個樣子，江氏心裏，就有些明白，一定是趙家的婚事，他有些不滿意，也不知道那天在外面聽着什麽言語來了，勾起他這一肚子的心事來，所以只管生氣。這個年頭，是自由的年頭，旣然姑娘不願意這頭親事，有話也是白說，不但不會成功，成了功，也是讓上輩人跟在後面受氣，那又何苦來？因之江氏忽然省悟過來。也就絶口不提這件事，其間有半月之久，把曾經一度熱鬧過的楊趙婚事就情淡下來了。（一一七）</p>
<h3 id="c198">走路姿式之研究 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>「走路人人會走，走法各有不同」。走路學博士說，最適當的姿式，是「八字步」，「八字步」的擺法，是把左，足跟對着右足的中點，而把左足的延長線，埀直到右足的中點上，左啼足的鞋尖，與右足的鞋尖和鞋跟，形成一個「二等邊三角形」。前進一步，把右足的鞋尖，與左足的鞋尖鞋跟，也形成一個「二等邊三角形」。用這一個姿式走路，據說，重心在「胸部」，所以能把胸部擴張。</p>
<p>反乎這個方式的，呌做「反八字步」。「八字步」是把「八」字倒着寫的，把鞋跟做起筆的。「反八字步」，同「八字步」正相反，雖然在幾何方式上，也是形成的「二等邊三角形」，但是這個「八」字寫起來，是要把鞋尖做起筆的。用這一種走踇姿式走起來，重心所在，也同「八字步」相反，焦點是在「背部」，所以鵝行鴨視的老先生起路來，十個倒有九個，是跨的「反八字步」。</p>
<p>「一字步」，也是走路姿式之一種，所謂「一字步」者，是把左右二足的延丰線，永久保存着「平行線」的地位。若站定了，二足活像一個「一」字。這個姿式，惟一妙用，就因「重心力」在「腹部」，而會得形成一個「大肚子」。「高等華人」以及「大亨」，跨「一字步」最老到。</p>
<p>「豎一字步」，二足的移動，與「一字步」處於截然不同的地位。「豎一字步」是把左足跟對右尖。前進一步，把右足跟對左足尖。二足聯成阿拉伯數字的「一」字形。用這姿式走路，可把「臀部」發達成極高度的曲線，而肥碩豐滿。因爲這個姿式的重心點，不高不低，恰在臀部。要做「肉感豐富」的「摩登姑娘」須跨「豎一字步。」</p>
<p>這是「走路姿式」的四大綱領，雖然千變萬化，儘能層出不窮，但總不外這幾個原則。讀者若不以爲無意識，留心一下，研究一番，或許是怪有味的。</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>「今天的天氣多麽好啊，」狗兒丁干心裏這麽想。「我要到農場裏去玩玩，看看有没有好玩有趣的事兒。」</p>
<p>它想了一回，便連奔帶走的趕進農塲裏去，嚇得母鷄們理逃西散，左避右躱，它一直奔到了鷄棚半邊，有幾隻比較勤勉的母鷄，正在那裏忙着生蛋。</p>
<p>「現在看見了有趣味的事了，」丁干說。</p>
<p>它剛走進鷄棚的時候，有上隻母鷄說，「丁干，你到這裏來幹什麽啊？我們正忙着生蛋。請你快出去吧！」</p>
<p>「我不出去！」丁干帶怒帶駡的說道。「在我走出去之前，你必須敎我怎樣生蛋。」</p>
<p>「好啊，敎你便了，」一隻肥胖的褐色的母鷄說。「看好，」它便爬進它的窠去！咯咯！咯咯！咯咯咯咯地呌了一陣，就有一個像它本身一樣褐色的蛋生下來了。</p>
<p>「那是很容易的，」這隻小狗說道。「讓我來試一試看。」因此它也爬進窼去，很適意的蹲着，這隻老母鷄却從旁看它。丁干用盡心計，施盡本領，想效學老母鷄的呌聲，但是得到很可憐的結果。</p>
<p>「用不着這麽長的時間啊，」老母鷄說，它覺得它的窠，自己以爲不甚舒服，恐怕丁干却認爲是很安逸的吧。</p>
<p>「我不能生蛋，」丁干很失望的說，「但是我很想住在這裏打一中覺。</p>
<p>「但是我想你恐不能够的，」老母鷄說。</p>
<p>「但是你看，」丁說，「我要幹，我馬上要幹」。</p>
<p>「那麽我將啄你了，」老母鷄說。</p>
<p>「呸！我不怕你啄。」丁干說，「你傷害不着我的」。</p>
<p>「喔，那麽你看着我吧，」老母鷄說道，它用足力氣，重重的把丁干啄了一下。</p>
<p>「汪！汪！汪！」丁干被老母鷄啄痛了，大呌一陣，連忙逃開，奔出鷄棚，一脚不停的狂奔，直奔到它的家裏纔止。</p>

<p>— 孺牛</p>
<p>希特拉先生不許德國境内的别的黨，連屈服了的國權黨也難倖存，這似乎頗感動了我們的有些英雄們，已在稱讚其「大刀闊斧」。但其實這不過是他老先生及其之流的一面。别一面，他們是也很細針密縷的。有歌爲證；</p>
<p>跳蚤做了大官了，</p>
<p>帶着一伙各處走。</p>
<p>皇后宮嬪都害怕，</p>
<p>誰也不敢來動手。</p>
<p>即使咬得發了癢罷，</p>
<p>要擠爛牠也怎麽能夠。</p>
<p>噯哈哈，噯哈哈，哈哈，噯哈哈！</p>
<p>這是大家知道的世界名曲「跳蚤歌」的一節，可是在德國已被禁止了。當然，這决不是爲了尊敬跳蚤，乃是因爲牠諷刺大官；但也不是爲了諷刺是「前世紀的老人的囈語」，却是爲着這歌曲是「非德意志的」。華德大小英雄們，總不免偶有隔膜之處。</p>
<p>中華也是誕生細針密縷人物的所在，有時眞能夠想得入微，例如今年北平社會局呈請市政府查禁女人養雄犬文云；</p>
<p>「···查雌女雄犬相處，非僅有碍健康，更易發，更易發生無恥穢聞，揆之我國禮　　義之邦，亦爲習俗所不許，謹特通令嚴禁，除門犬獵犬外，凡婦女帶養之　　雄犬，斬之無赦，以爲取締。」</p>
<p>兩國之立脚點，是都在「國焠」的，但中華的氣魄却較爲宏大，因爲德國不過大家不能唱那一齣歌而已，而中華則不但「雌女」難以蓄犬，連「雄犬」也將砍頭。這影響於叭兒狗，是很大的，由保存自己的本能，和應時勢之需要，牠必將變成「門犬獵犬」模樣。</p>
<h3 id="c202">男性的心 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>「英雄有淚不輕流，祇因未到傷心處。」這是中國名劇「夜奔」中英雄林冲吟咏的句子。我聽見這句話，就把它刻在記憶裏，我覺得這是男性的心的最高的表現。</p>
<p>於是我也想把我的心鍊得像一塊鐵，忍受世間所謂的一切痛苦，淚在眼圈裏轉着，我再把它呑到肚裏。我很驕傲我的健壯，我輕蔑一切女性的人。</p>
<p>但是上帝會折磨我，他使我愛上了一個人，一個具有最纖細的心的女性。她的情感是那麽彎曲，她的神經是那麽銳敏，而我，是一個情感荒蕪了的孩子，粗暴更加戇直。我們生活在一起，彼此不能理解，我輕蔑她，她懷疑我。最後，在一個深夜裏，她哭泣了，那慟心的哭泣呀！於是，在第二天，她悄悄地走了，毫無留戀地。</p>
<p>惡魔仍然駕在我的身上，我想，一個人應當爲了女人的愛情而消損麽？我獰笑着，我飲酒慶祝這女人的逃走，我甚至感謝上帝再給與我以自由。</p>
<p>但是一個人絶不能長久地欺騙着自己，的心，在深夜裏，心張開了眼，輕輕地低訴着，「你是愛她的，没有她你將不能生活喲？」</p>
<p>漸漸地傳來了心的微痛，我掙扎着想抵抗它，不使它戰勝了我，我，這個具有最强壯的男性的心的人丨我發着狂笑，止住眼中的淚，但那是怎樣地笑聲呢</p>
<p>丨你們曾否在深夜中徘徊在荒塜間，聽見過鬼的笑聲呢？丨丨這便是那種可怕的聲音！</p>
<p>其次，我感到，如果我的情感再不給我鬆緩，我將變成一個精靈了，爲什麽我不應該放聲地哭泣呢，用涙來潤澤我的痛苦，璷示我的懺悔，在上帝，在人類的面前，低下頭來？</p>
<p>在我的背後那一向推動着我的强有力的巨大的手，現在越發顯示了它的威力，我完全被它克服了。</p>
<p>我伏在枕上，大聲地哭泣了，那淚，那珍貴的涙呀！同時我憶起了歌德的名句；</p>
<p>「誰未曾滴着眼淚呑食麵包，　　誰未曾在深夜低泣，　　孤坐候來朝，　　他不認識你呀，你偉大的神力！」</p>

<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>幾個人在橋頭乘風凉，我走上橋去，大家便擠着眉停住嘴了。小林問我道；「福根，你做好日了？」</p>
<p>我點點頭走過去，聽見他們在背後一陣鬨笑，那笑聲，就像一把火，炙到我背上。</p>
<p>有什麽好笑？難道人生得窮一點，連做好日討老婆也不該了嗎？人都說我傻，其實只不過生得窮一點兒罷了，傻在那裏？我今年二十三歲了，平常這年紀早已娶了親生小孩了，可是我，遠遠近近的姑娘們，都歡喜我但又不肯嫁我，那還不是爲了我窮？爹爲了我對不成親也氣憤不過，他說要買田當地，來爭了這一口氣，以後就一家人餓肚皮也說不得。如今這親事總算定了。姑娘雖然住得遠，但聽說人很年輕，家道也好。爹歡喜，我也歡喜，連財禮首飾，已經化了一千多了。冰人是祥生老爹和友生先生。</p>
<p>於是我回頭去朝他們唾了一口，他們正指手畫脚的說得高興。小林看見我回頭，揚着手高聲道；「福根，你的老婆今天還不進門，親做不成了。」</p>
<p>親做不成，眞是放屁。兩天不來，那麽遠的路，兩天自然趕不到；但今天一定要趕到的。爹不是正呌我去催祥生爹，要和他商量麽？我相信親不會不來的。</p>
<p>祥生爹不在家。我轉來的時候，橋上的人都散了，天已經煞黑。爹聽說他不在家，又打發人去請友生先生，也不在。有人說，怕有了變動了，媒人都藏起來。大家没法，客人們都嘘着氣，紛紛的散去。難道文親事眞有了什麽變動？我想不透這奥妙，但看爹的臉色，似乎，很難受。</p>
<p>這天是第三天了，早上起來，大家似乎忘記了第了兩天的事，客人們照樣熱鬧起來。我躭了一晚心，總算可以安頓一下，爹淸早就打發人到七寳橋女家催親去了。小林的話是不會準的，等過了好日，做過親，我要朝他面門上　　　口濃沬。······</p>
<p>····然而，然而，又是挨晚了。滿堂的客人都揩着汗水紛紛的談論起來。新娘却終不見來。爹嘆了一口氣道；「中了計了。」</p>
<p>中了什麽計呢？難道這一回親又不成了？我不能相信，我想這事是小林在中間作怪，要不然他怎麽會先知道我的親做不成。</p>
<p>於是我想去找他算賬。我走上他的家。他已經不在，逃走了；我走到橋上，一羣人正聚在那兒，我看見小林夾在中間，他閃避不及，被我一把抓住。他没有料到我會尋到此地。</p>
<p>出其不意，我在他臉上先敲了兩記耳光，他反轉腦袋嚷道。「你幹什麽？」</p>
<p>我說，「你使了什麽窄狹，害我做不成親？」大家在我四周大笑起來。小林在我手中掙扎，想要逃走，我死命扼住了他。他們是約好不夥了的。四面都伸出手來，隨後就把小林從我手中奪走。我自己跌在地上。他們一面哄笑，一面把我按在地上，有人說，「來看傻新郎呀！今朝給他做親。」</p>
<p>我在他們手下昏過去，醒來時，橋上已經只剩下我一人，靑蛙在四周嚷呌。正和他們的哄笑一樣。我决心要跳下水去，但我想，新人也許進了門了罷？於是我站起來走下橋去。</p>
<p>我想新人是不會不來的，那麽遠的路程，三天自然趕不到。</p>

<p>— 何如</p>
<p>予旣爲再論鑼鼓一文，頃聞羅復先生，已有駁論，尙未發表，（編者按卽昨日羅復先生之文）未　其　何語，想有愈多愈妙之新解　人，是無疑也。惟予儉腹貽羞，又無書袋可掉。猶復視顏爲此三論者，一以稍盡前論未竟之意，一以冀得顧曲專家之高論。書生論曲，謬託知音。舞臺實情，敢質眞賞。</p>
<p>顧予有略須申述者，一則妄慮讀者眼花之撩亂，一則預防辯者論點之支離。故予於前此二論，要點所在，不惜重提；一日「以崑曲言，曷嘗不重鑼鼓？」予引李笠翁佟賦敏之說爲證姑引陳言，非出新解，倘有錯繆，不代負咎也。二則蠡測我國舊戲中鑼鼓與武把子之歷史來源，以爲出自秦漢以至隋唐之間角觝有戲，以及代面一類之歌舞戲，因謂中國自有戲劇之一物，卽不離鑼鼓，係自其起源而言之，亦但言其有鑼鼓而已，非謂其鑼鼓之種類，敲法，一如今日也，三則予謂顧氏客座贅語，所言北曲大四套，中間錯以撮墊圈，舞觀音，或百丈旗，或跳墜子爲武把子，以其顯爲百戲中雜伎之遺也。雖然，予於北曲，僅讀元劇數十種，於其舞臺上之實際情形，則茫然無知，所論止此，不敢强作解人也。</p>
<p>今所欲補論者，羅復先生謂「明萬暦前後，北曲南曲全都不用鑼鼓」又謂「南曲　初不用鑼鼓。」因謂予旣引李笠翁論鑼鼓之言爲證，又言「笠翁此論發於崑曲没落之際」，爲予論證最大之漏洞，予已於再再中駁之矣。魏良輔曲律有言；「淸唱俗語謂之冷板凳。不比戲塲借鑼鼓之勢，全要閑雅整肅，淸俊温潤。」魏氏爲崑曲之鼻祖，論曲已及鑼鼓，安得强謂「明萬暦前後，北曲南曲全都不用鑼鼓」乎？此種大膽之新解，惟羅復先生始有之。而又自誇其爲正確。又朱竹垞靜志居詩話謂康對山殁時，家無長物，惟腰鼓多至三百副。陸侃如詩史則云大小鼓三百副。按康海爲成化嘉靖間人，約與魏良輔同時而較早。彼爲當時北曲有名之作者，未聞其兼工南曲。蓄鼓何爲？其數尤爲可驚。但予不敢遽出新解，謂爲北曲有鑼鼓之證也。</p>
<p>予之立論止此，答辯亦止此，政見之爭，居恒雞蟲得失視之。復以文字爲戈　，予豈猶有蓬之心也夫！</p>

<p>「如果天空有一個污點，睡上有一堆獸糞，這都是準備給他的。」</p>

<p>有時候雷辟克家的提到紅蘿蔔鬚時說；</p>
<p>「他同我一樣不會弄什麽狡獪的，與其說他惡不加說他蠢，他腦子太呆了，想不出什麽花樣來的。」</p>
<p>有時候又承認如果他不被小豬吃掉的話，將來會要發達的。</p>

<p>白桐油自行銷歐美以來，距今四五年前，爲出口最盛時代、價格亦飛　至每擔四十餘兩。因價高利厚，作僞亦層出不窮。初則　入柏芯，（卽柏子之内仁）緣有調劑兩性功效，尙屬冠冕堂皇。嗣後每况愈下，凡比白桐油爲賤之油，幾無不攙入，甚至礦產之黃油（錠子油），爲作僞之主要成分。僅有少數顧全牌面之號家，尙不肯十分惡劣。若惟利是圖者，其所售之貨，眞正桐油，祗十之二三成。至鑒别眞僞，絶不易易，故洋莊必用比重的器械騐明度數。大槪植物油類中，以桐油度數爲最高，眞正之原貨桐油。其度數總在一五一七○之間。所以洋行家所辦，至少限度爲一五一六八，如不及此度，必將貨退還。職是之故，出品貨不能作僞。尙是原貨。國内所銷，竟干不堪。受其欺者，厥爲用户，或貪一二之便宜，而吃十足之大虧。如欲以目力鑒别眞僞，實非易易。普通看法，第一觀其色，淡而嫰黃，浮面無煤油亮光。再則嗅其氣，純粹爲桐油氣、而無其他氣味。體質凝重，五十度以下之温度，則凍如黃蠟。，且桐油體重，黃油屬礦產物而體輕，重者下沉，輕者上浮，細加觀察，不難明白。苟能具此目光，自不致受紿也。</p>
<p>洪江桐油本係白桐油所改造，故無出口去路。白桐油尙可作僞，洪桐油自必作僞更甚矣，其種類旣有正牌副牌之别，其貨品惟以各榨坊之牌號分優劣。雖各有註册之商標，均不重視，市上所稱某牌某牌者，均係榨坊之牌號耳。其產地遠在湘南之洪江鎭，行銷以江浙兩省居其多數。故僞造冒牌等事，亦在蘇杭一帶。洪桐油因改造後，無度數可騐，辨别更難。全仗色嗅味三處以判眞僞，而甚不易。有用油脚壓榨後之餘瀝和入，亦有將黃油提煉後、去其氣味，則非内家不辨。用户祗有觀其色光明亮氣味純正而已。而購者如認牌號，則有冒牌，故須觀察商標之眞僞。但亦有桶爲眞桶，油爲僞油，可謂無惡不作，辨不勝辨，祗有求之較重信用之店家耳。</p>

<p>Xue Zhiheng and Others Discuss Reorganizing Puppet Troops in Dalian</p>
<p>The Substantive Issues of Reception Cannot Yet Be Discussed</p>
<p>Active Negotiations Underway for the Opening of the Beining Railway</p>
<p>Japanese Side Uses the Chahar Incident as an Excuse to Delay the Withdrawal of Troops from Northern Hebei</p>
<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Reception Committee was formally established this afternoon in the Hebei Provincial Government in Tianjin. No ceremony was held; only the committee members held a discussion meeting and had lunch before dispersing. The procedures to be followed were briefly discussed. Because Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, and Yin Tong had gone to Dalian to meet with Li Jichun to discuss the reorganization and stationing of troops, no telegrams had yet arrived in Tianjin. Therefore, the substantive issues of war zone reception still require some time. Preparations are underway to open the Beining Railway to Tangshan. Qian Zongze is currently in Tianjin actively negotiating with the Japanese side, and it is expected to be realized soon. Colonel Kita, who is responsible for liaison on the Japanese side, has arrived in Tanggu, and Chiba is also on his way to China. Currently, Japanese troops are gradually withdrawing from various locations in the front lines. Recently, the Japanese side used the Chahar Incident as an excuse, claiming that the Hebei border was under threat, and demanded that all troops stationed north of Miyun not withdraw for the time being, but only after the Chahar Incident is resolved could they withdraw from the Great Wall line. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and others are expected to arrive in Dalian today. Li Jichun, Kan Feng, and others are waiting in Dalian. After Xue arrives, the meeting will begin immediately. The Japanese Kwantung Army has also sent several representatives to participate. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Government, considering that the areas of eastern Luan and eastern Ping are extremely devastated and that the political and economic organizations have been completely destroyed, has decided to establish one commissioner in each of the two locations, following the methods used to recover bandit-controlled areas, to supervise and urge the county magistrates to reorganize government affairs. Once local order is restored, the commissioners will be removed. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The crux of the puppet troops issue remains the restoration of transportation on the Beining Railway. Our side advocates first opening the railway from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao, while the Japanese side advocates first opening it to Tangshan. If the opening of the Beining Railway cannot be realized, then the Beining Railway will likely go bankrupt. Regarding the issue of reorganizing the puppet troops, it can only be determined after the representatives, including Xue Zhiheng, arrive in Dalian and discuss it with Li Jichun. The administrative organs organized by Hao Peng in Qinhuangdao have not yet been abolished. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese Kwantung Army implemented management of the Yutang section of the railway, it has reached an agreement with Kailuan to begin transporting coal, with daily revenue exceeding four thousand yuan. Whether the Japanese side will be willing to relinquish this in the future will depend on the outcome of the Dalian meeting. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) From Lutai: Puppet troop commander Zhao Lei is still in Tangshan. Subordinates of Li Jichun are stationed in the areas of Xugezhuang and Ninghe. There is news of a change of guard for the Fourth Brigade originally stationed in Ninghe city, but it has not yet been implemented. The Japanese troops at Jiangwakou have not yet withdrawn.

<p>Likely in the Waters off Weihaiwei</p>
<p>The Beiping Military Council Sends Personnel to Qingdao to Investigate</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Honglie telegraphed that the whereabouts of the three warships, including the Haiqi, remain unknown after they left Shidao. The wireless radios of the three warships have also not been switched on. Aircraft have been dispatched to scout and it appears that they are in the waters off Weihaiwei. The naval lieutenant dispatched to the Haiqi to mediate is still on the warship and has not returned. Jiang Lian has sent three telegrams to Shen to express his condolences. Shen has dispatched Councilor Bao Yimin to Beiping. Bao arrived in Beiping on the 30th and immediately met with He Yingqin to report the truth of the incident. Today, He is sending Zhao Xun, a staff officer from the Military Council, and Section Chief Wei Qigong to Tanggu to proceed to Weihai to investigate. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Tan said that the provincial government will appoint someone to mediate the naval affair and guarantee that they will return to Qingdao without being punished. I advised Shen not to resign as mayor, and Shen has agreed. Also, a telegram from Weihai states that the three warships have not arrived in Wei. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council, acting on orders from the central government, is handling the Qingdao naval incident and has now sent Li Ronglin to Qingdao to investigate. Li departed yesterday. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Rong Guangxing, commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Yantai, sent Chief of Staff Xie Zepu to Qingdao on the evening of the 30th to meet with Shen Honglie, to offer his condolences and urge him to stay. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The citizens of the entire city and surrounding rural areas have jointly elected representatives to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan's Beiping Branch daily, earnestly requesting that they follow public opinion and approve Shen Mayor's retention. Also, the city's academic groups have scheduled a meeting on the 2nd to discuss methods for retaining Shen. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>Briefly Suspended, Then Resumed Work</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The tram workers' strike has reached a stalemate due to ineffective mediation. The workers' demands for improved treatment and the reinstatement of dismissed workers were supposed to be answered by the company on the evening of the 30th. By the morning of the 1st, there was still no concrete resolution. Therefore, the union implemented a strike starting at 2:00 PM on the 1st, and all tram lines were suspended. Also, union committee member Zhang Guangxing was beaten in the morning of the 1st on Dajing Road in Hebei. It is said that the realization of the strike was also a cause of this. (One-day Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin tram workers' strike resumed work on the evening of the 1st after mediation by the Party and government authorities. The conditions proposed by the workers will be discussed by both parties at a meeting scheduled for the 3rd. The union resumed work in advance out of consideration for the city's transportation.

<p>The Robbery of the Sheng'an Steamer Is Solved</p>
<p>Shipowner Couple and Seven Chinese Sailors Brutally Murdered</p>
<p>Ship Ran Aground En Route to Dalian, Leading to the Solving of the Case</p>
<h3 id="e12">Three German Robbers Arrested <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Dalian) Several days ago, a Chinese cargo ship of 1,800 tons, whose owner was a Russian named Vikharmin, set sail from Tianjin. At the time, the ship carried the shipowner's wife and five other passengers claiming to be German. However, after the ship passed Tanggu, the shipowner couple and seven Chinese sailors were murdered by the passengers. The passengers intended to sail the ship to the American coast to sell it, but feeling a lack of food supplies, they sailed into Xingpu to buy food in Dalian. However, due to poor navigation, they ran aground. As they were trying to find a way to move the ship out, they were discovered by the police, who arrested three of them. The other two have escaped and are currently being intensively searched for. Continuing telegram, the stolen Chinese ship is the "Sheng'an" (transliteration) of the Tianjin Huayang Shipping Company. The ship has a load capacity of 1,401 tons and was built in 1903. This robbery occurred on June 26th en route to Shanghai. According to a report by the Japanese police, the tragedy occurred 200 miles from Shanghai. At that time, three Europeans and seven Chinese were killed, and their bodies were thrown into the sea. The rest were forced to surrender. Afterwards, the five people (four German, one Swiss) changed the ship's course to Dalian, preparing to load food in Dalian and sail to the United States, then sell the ship for 30,000 yuan and the cargo for 80,000 yuan. However, the ship's grounding led to the cracking of the case. The three arrested are named Doding, 55 years old; Signa; and Beston, all German. Those who escaped are a German named Mona, 25 years old, and a Swiss named Kochi, 32 years old. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The captain of the Sheng'an ship was a Russian named Vikmen, about 40 years old, who used to be an officer in the Russian Imperial Navy. The other European victims were the first mate, Mr. Azariv, and his new wife, who was Latvian. They were married in Tianjin only four months ago and had lived in Shanghai for some time before the marriage. This time, she accompanied her husband to Shanghai to settle down. The murderers boarded the ship in Tanggu. The details of the murder on the ship are not yet known. It is estimated that after killing ten people, the remaining Chinese sailors were forced to submit. The robbers sailed the ship to Dalian, intending to prepare food for the 34-day voyage across the Pacific Ocean. However, the leader of the robbers did not know the sea route, causing the ship to run aground near Xingpu. Therefore, the robbers were terrified and decided to abandon the ship and land. To prevent the sailors in the ship from leaking their secrets, they locked all 58 people in one room. This morning at 3:00 AM, the leader of the robbers, Doding, and four accomplices took a plank and landed on the shore of Xingpu, where they were seen by a policeman. Because the group looked suspicious, the policeman followed them. The robbers then split up and fled. The policeman arrested Doding and took him to the nearest police station for questioning, and issued an alert to search for the four fugitives. Later in the morning, Beston and Mona were arrested in a Chinese brothel. Although the two fugitives, Signa and Kochi, were searched for house to house, they were nowhere to be found. Today, the Japanese ship Tianjin, which arrived here from Tanggu, also narrowly escaped an incident. According to the captain, who spoke to a Reuters reporter, when the ship was weighing anchor directly from Tanggu yesterday morning, five suspicious foreigners boarded the ship, insisting on hitching a ride. When they could not be driven away, the police were summoned to arrest and escort these five people to Tianjin. These people are probably not good people either. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Sturton Reports on the State of the Yangtze River Dikes <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Main Dikes Have Not Collapsed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission received a report on the recent water levels and dikes of the Yangtze River from Sturton, Chief Engineer of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, saying that the main dikes along the Yangtze River and its main tributaries, which were built by the National Government Flood Relief Committee and continued by the National Economic Commission, have not experienced any collapses despite the high water levels this year. For example, the water level in Jiujiang is less than one foot below the highest water level in 1931. The dikes are withstanding the impact of the waves, which shows the solidity of the engineering. The reports of several collapses are referring to civilian dikes, which are not very important and protect very small areas. Observers who do not understand this may see civilian houses and fields being flooded and mistakenly believe that the main dikes have collapsed. They do not know that farmers near the river always build houses within the boundaries of hastily built civilian dikes, so that when the water level rises slightly, they are flooded. Also, a passenger on a river steamer once mistakenly thought that the tidal flat behind the main dike was a collapse of the main dike and that the river water was flooding. They did not know that the place was originally a natural lake. Such erroneous reports are mostly due to careless observation. To make accurate observations and comments, one must have considerable knowledge. Mr. Sturton went to inspect the Wujin Dike, which is about 20 miles long, this Tuesday and found six leaks. The largest leak had a flow of about half a gallon per second. There were also leaks in the stone nest of the Wutai Gate, which have all been repaired. Recently, the water level of the Yangtze River has been gradually decreasing, with Chongqing down 30 feet, Yichang down 12 feet, Changsha down 5 feet, and the water level in Hankou also gradually decreasing. The water in the first and third special districts has reached the shore, while the water in the first special district and the French Concession is lower than the shore. The current water level is about 3 feet higher than the water level on the same day in June 28, 1911. The highest water level in August of that year was only even with the shore. Therefore, if the rainfall this year is not greater than in 1911, then the Yangtze River flood this time will likely not cause a disaster. The rise and fall of the river water depends entirely on the amount of rainfall. Although rainfall cannot be accurately predicted by anyone, based on past experience, the government should actively prevent disasters before they happen, but there is no need to be overly worried.

In addition to Hankou receding 2 inches, Changsha receded 7 inches, Yuezhou receded 6 inches, Shashi receded 8 inches, Chongqing was stable, and Yichang rose 3 inches. If there is no heavy rain in the coming days, it is hoped that it will gradually recede. The provincial government has decided to complete the construction of the various dikes in the short term to prevent future floods, and has ordered the Engineering Bureau to allocate 50,000 yuan for the repair of dikes and sluice gates in the suburban areas of the province. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded 2 inches on the 1st, with a water level of 46 feet 6 inches, equal to the level of the shore. The flooded sidewalks along the river have all emerged.

The engineering team has also been expanded to nine teams to speed up work. The Zhouju Bridge Gate has been turned from danger to safety. The leakage at the San Yi Temple of the Zhuzi Factory was severe. On the 1st, burlap bags were added to block it. Also, the river water灌入at the Xiaogong Gate in Tuanfeng was extremely fierce and dangerous. The provincial government ordered the Huanggang County Magistrate to supervise the rescue and commended Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Hankou, for his effective flood prevention.

According to the records of the astronomical observatory, from 1914 to 1932, the highest amount of rainfall in June was 26.8 millimeters, but on the 25th of last month it was 260 millimeters. The average amount of rainfall in June is 65.8 millimeters.

<p>Seizing Shanghai's Position with Qingdao</p>
<p>Extending Influence towards the Yellow River Basin</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to this morning's Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs plan to expand the political and economic organization in North China, forming a stable region in North China centered on the Yellow River. The first step of the plan is as follows: (1) To make Qingdao the second Shanghai; (2) To facilitate Qingdao's role as the trade center of North China, extend the Shandong Railway, first to Xi'an in Shaanxi, and then to Lanzhou in Gansu; (3) This plan is based on the principle of equal opportunity and is linked to the Belgian-loaned railway from Daokouzhen to Jinchengguan or the British-loaned railway from Kaifeng to Tongguan, part of the Longhai Line; (4) Therefore, necessary diplomatic discussions must be initiated regarding the setting of joint operations with Britain and Belgium; (5) In addition to being an economic facility in North China, this newly established trans-provincial railway is also necessary for the Gansu region, and this matter must attract the attention of others; (6) If Britain and Belgium sincerely and openly recognize the joint operation of the railway, Japan will initiate internal negotiations with China in the form of a trilateral joint loan.

<p>(Tokyo) Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Uchida has been considering a well-thought-out plan to establish independent economic diplomacy. Recently, due to the cancellation of the Japan-India trade treaty, adjusting British-Japanese issues and reforming cooperative economic relations have become absolute necessities. For the above purposes, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to request the necessary funding from the Ministry of Finance. The content of the plan is as follows: (1) To establish new embassies in Egypt, Abyssinia, Afghanistan, and Colombia; (2) To increase the number of commercial officials stationed in Changchun and New York, and to newly dispatch commercial officials to Batavia, Bangkok, Ottawa, Sydney, Cairo, and Buenos Aires; (3) To establish embassies or increase the number of commercial officials in areas in the Near East, South Africa, India, the South Seas, and South America where there are no consulates or embassies. (A Dispatch from the Rengo Agency on July 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new economic diplomacy policy established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to adopt both the conventional approach of developing large markets and the approach of developing small markets. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the number of commercial officials. A concrete plan has recently been obtained, and it has been decided to compile a budget within days and submit it to the Ministry Council. The outline is as follows: (1) Establishment of new embassies: Egypt, Abyssinia, Afghanistan, and Colombia have recently become new markets for Japanese goods, and the establishment of new trade treaties is imminent; (2) Increase of two Commercial Counselors at embassies (Changchun, New York): Changchun must establish Japanese-Manchukuo economics, and New York is the most important location for Japan's foreign trade, both requiring additional personnel; (3) Candidate locations for the deployment of Commercial Secretaries: Batavia, Bangkok, Ottawa, Sydney, Cairo, Buenos Aires, Paris; (4) Commercial officials stationed in resident locations in the past must now travel to all areas under their jurisdiction to conduct investigations; (5) Consuls stationed in important commercial locations must execute commerce and maintain close communication with domestic trade; (6) A new section will be added to the Commerce Bureau to expand overseas commercial facilities, and bureau personnel will be increased.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Muto Jugoro, an advisor to the Japanese delegation, he returned to the British Board of Trade yesterday with Commercial Official Matsuyama and met with Wilson, a counselor at the Board of Trade. Wilson told him that Britain is eager for the Japan-India meeting to be changed to a British-Japanese meeting, to be held in London. The Japanese government advocates free competition, which is theoretically not impossible, but Japanese goods contain conditions that disrupt the world market. Britain's proposed market agreement is not limited to Britain and its territories, but seeks a global agreement. Upon receiving this news, the Japanese side believes that Britain is changing its mind midway with ill intentions, and the future of British-Japanese negotiations is very pessimistic. (A Dispatch from the Hualian Agency on July 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Muto, an advisor to the Japanese delegation, and Commercial Official Matsuyama visited Wilson, a counselor at the British Board of Trade, today for a long discussion. It is said that the content of the discussion was the British-Japanese and Japan-India trade issues. Wilson requested that the Japanese representatives hold the Japan-India conference in Britain. Furthermore, he stated that free competition between Japanese and British goods is a natural matter, but Japanese goods have become major disruptors in overseas markets, and requested Japan to consider this fact. When Japan establishes a market agreement, please explain the broad definition of a market. It is rumored that the broad market intended by Britain is not only Britain but also includes third countries, so the impact is quite significant. The Japanese side believes that Britain has exposed its ambition. (A Dispatch from the Rengo Agency on June 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Muto, an advisor to the Japanese delegation, met with Wilson, a counselor at the British commercial group, Britain hoped to move the Japan-India conference from Simla to London. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received an official telegram, but denies this matter, stating that Japan's negotiation with India is a diplomatic negotiation to discuss the aftermath of the abolition of the Japan-India trade treaty. The fundamental principle of this negotiation has already been understood by the British and Indian authorities, so Britain will definitely not propose such an event. The qualifications of both Muto and Wilson do not allow them to discuss such issues. (A Dispatch from the Rengo Agency on July 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Matsuyama, the commercial official stationed in London, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cotton Products Trade League, headquartered in Manchester and specializing in the export of cotton products from that area, announced on the 29th the results of a survey on the impact of competition between British cotton and Japanese goods, stating that to protect the British colonial market, it advocated the cancellation of the British-Japanese trade treaty.

<p>Chairman Lin Encourages the People to be United in Heart and Mind</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10 AM on the 1st, the National Government held a ceremony to commemorate the 6th anniversary of its founding. Among those in attendance were Wang Zhaoming, Zhang Ji, Luo Wengan, Niu Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Li Yuanding, Zhang Daofan, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shuren, Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Zhang Zhizhong, Lv Chao, and representatives of various Yuan (Councils), Ministries, and Committees, as well as staff members of the National Government, totaling over 600 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a speech, stating that in commemorating the founding of the National Government, we should recall the process of its establishment. Since the Northern Expedition, the unification of the country, and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the Five Yuan and various Ministries and Committees have been working hard amidst difficulties. It is like a navigator advancing a boat in a storm. In addition to the compass, charts, and anchor, it also requires everyone on the ship to be united in heart and mind to overcome difficulties together in order to reach their destination. Our country is now in a similar situation. In addition to relying on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as a compass, the government and the people should work together and strengthen their resolve in times of danger, moving forward bravely, overcoming difficulties, and stabilizing the foundation of the country. Considering the current external troubles and internal worries, which are pressing down on us, and that internal worries often intensify due to external troubles, if the government and the people can be united in heart and mind, and set an example, be honest and just, and show the people a model, so that they know what to adhere to in times of difficulty, then difficulties can ultimately be overcome and the country will have a bright future.

<h3 id="e58">Reflections on the Constitutional Debate <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan established the Constitution Drafting Committee, the drafter has been burying his head in drafting the initial draft amidst the serious national crisis, and it has recently appeared in newspapers. Subsequently, various reviews have emerged, with mixed praise and criticism and much discussion. The country's situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs, yet scholars are able to concentrate on this alone, engaging in endless debates. Could it be that they also feel the sentiment of "saving the country through the constitution"? In this regard, this newspaper dares not make any claims. Those who criticize us may be like those who blame summer insects for not being able to speak of ice.</p>
<p>Drafting a constitution is a major policy of the country. France issued constitutions ten times from 1789 to 1875. From the beginning of the revolution to the Directorate period, constitution expert Sieyès participated in the process. His desk was full of draft constitutions. However, is reading the Classic of Filial Piety enough to repel thieves? Can simply drafting a constitution avoid the political turmoil and terror in France at that time? Precedents in constitutional history are clearly traceable. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee whether borrowing a constitution to save the country from danger will succeed. However, current discussions focus solely on the strengths and weaknesses of constitution drafting techniques, while neglecting the prior issues that are a hundred times more important than constitution drafting techniques. Abandoning the important for the trivial and rushing the slow cannot but cause doubt.</p>
<p>In the current discussions on the draft constitution, some criticize the government for "not specially hiring experts in a solemn manner to establish a committee to draft it, but instead entrusting it to the Legislative Yuan, a government agency composed of officials." Others criticize it for "being compiled according to the Three Principles of the People, resulting in extremely clumsy chapter arrangements in terms of legislative technique." Still others criticize it for not calling the "Republic of China a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The questions raised are indeed reasonable. However, it is also very easy to act as a defense attorney for the draft. In the past, Napoleon ordered Baudry, Tronchet, Pigeau, and Maleville to draft the Civil Code. He pointed to the four and said, "I give you six months to create a Civil Code for me." The four humbly retreated and competed to cooperate under Napoleon's whip. The Civil Code was eventually completed and has been promulgated for a hundred years. Considering the past, Napoleon never had a solemn ceremony. The key to drafting laws lies not in the solemnity of the form, but in the effectiveness of the substance. This can be used as the first defense for the initial draft. The chapters of the constitution are not immutable. Legislative technique is not a rigid and inflexible path. The French Constitution of 1875 is fragmented and unsystematic, let alone chapter arrangements. The German Weimar Constitution is extremely detailed and differs greatly from various past constitutions. The Soviet Constitution is even more innovative. Classical constitutional scholars consider it shocking. Therefore, compiling it according to the Three Principles of the People is not surprising. Moreover, the purpose-based compilation method is superior to the form-based compilation method. This can be used as the second defense for the initial draft. As for calling the Republic of China a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People, it is not an innovation. The Soviet Union calls itself the "Soviet Socialist Russian Federal Republic," which is clear evidence. This can be used as the third defense for the initial draft. As for the remaining points of contention, each has its own perspective. The drafter may have omissions, but onlookers are clear-minded and can point out the flaws. The more reason is debated, the clearer it becomes. It is the responsibility of scholars to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses, so there is no need to be emotional. However, we cannot remain silent if those who debate the constitution focus on the strengths and weaknesses of constitution drafting techniques while ignoring the prior issues that are a hundred times more important than constitution drafting techniques.</p>
<p>What is the prior issue in drafting a constitution? The life of a constitution does not lie in the hands of the lawmakers, but in the hands of those who implement the constitution. If the lawmakers' responsibility is to internally consult the spirit of the nation and externally consider the trends of the world, striving to make the draft constitution a reflection of the nation's most urgent needs, then they have already done their utmost. As for how to use the constitution to implement it without obstruction and to make it effective, how to make the constitution evolve into a living life and not become a dead formality, even the most intelligent and talented lawmakers cannot solve it. The task of lawmakers is limited to technique, while how to promote and maximize benefits depends on those responsible for political operations. In the past, the German scholar Savigny believed that the relationship between law and lawmakers was a "technical element," and the relationship between law and national life was a "political element." He believed that the political element was more important than the technical element. Although his theory is inevitably flawed in terms of obliterating the value of written law, the actual effectiveness of the law must be emphasized, which is the consensus of the general public.</p>
<p>According to the actual effectiveness of the constitution, it not only requires legislative techniques that meet actual needs but also requires a strong interest in constitution drafting. What is a strong interest in constitution drafting? It is the movement to fight for the constitution. The development of constitutionalism in Europe and America is often driven by the self-struggle of the people. The people shed blood and fought, one after another, and only after a long period of resistance did they obtain the power to draft a constitution. Therefore, the people regard the constitution as a treasure, and everyone has a heart to protect the constitution. The government naturally does not dare to destroy the constitution. The German scholar Ihering once said, "A law that has not been obtained through struggle is like a lost child picked up on the street and is not worthy of cherishing. If it is born from oneself and one wants to take it away from the mother's arms, then the mother will definitely roar and refuse to give up." These words are wise. Do those who discuss the constitution today recognize that this constitution in the making is a lost child lost by someone else, or a beloved child in the mother's arms? If this question is not resolved, then all discussions of technical issues are nothing but a waste of words.</p>
<p>Now let us look back at the situation of our country and the situation of the people. The territory is shrinking day by day, the population is decreasing day by day, unemployment is rampant in cities, rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, floods and droughts continue unabated, internal warfare and fires are rising one after another, bandits are everywhere, and taxes are heavy. People are struggling to protect their lives, let alone participating in politics or fighting for rights. The authorities are working hard to plan for the country, loudly calling for unification and saving the country from danger through the constitution. However, in reality, the obstacles to unification are only a few warlords and politicians. These people prefer to have no laws. Now, wanting to use a piece of paper to offer to these people in order to promote unification is almost like seeking a tiger for its skin. Our country has created laws that are voluminous, but the country has never received the effect of the rule of law, and the people have never received actual protection. The powerful always regard the law as a trifle. Clearly there are laws to follow, but they must seek it outside the law. The effectiveness of the law is minimal, and the people naturally have no possibility of abiding by the law. How close is the relationship between law and society?

<p>The British King Signs an Order to Withdraw the Ban on Russian Goods</p>
<p>Effective Immediately After the Release of the Two British Engineers</p>
<p>The Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Russia Removes a Small Obstacle</p>
<p>(London) The British-Russian trade war ended today. The British King signed an order this afternoon to withdraw the ban on the import of Russian goods, effective immediately after Moscow releases the two British engineers. This is the result of the fourth meeting this morning between British Foreign Secretary Simon and Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov. Initially, the Russian side insisted that Britain lift the ban first, and then Russia would release the people. It was not until today's meeting that it was agreed that both parties would implement it simultaneously: the two engineers would be released and deported by Russia immediately. In addition, the Russian side also withdrew various retaliatory plans for business, and the two countries immediately reopened negotiations to conclude a trade agreement. It is rumored that both sides plan to issue a formal exchange of letters detailing the agreed-upon methods, which is expected to be announced on Sunday afternoon. It is now said that after the resolution of the British-Russian trade war, it can also remove a small obstacle to the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia.

<h3 id="e60">European Gold Bloc Proposes Joint Effort with US to Curb Currency Speculation <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Economic Conference Extended</p>
<p>Awaiting White House Response</p>
<p>(London) After a day and a night of precarious uncertainty, the fate of the World Economic Conference now hinges on a final plan to curb exchange rate volatility and protect the gold standard, awaiting the US President's response. Newspaper dispatches indicate the proposal is likely satisfactory to the US President and has already been accepted by US Undersecretary of State Moley, pending only presidential approval. Washington sources say the President sees no objection to central banks engaging in efforts to curb exchange rate fluctuations, but believes temporary stabilization is the responsibility of these banks, not the government. Commentators suggest that, based on this news, the President has, in principle, approved the European plan.</p>
<p>This plan was drafted by England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland, and discussed with Moley. It reportedly contains the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The aforementioned countries (including the United States) will issue a joint declaration guaranteeing central bank cooperation to prevent speculative exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>(2) The declaration will solemnly reaffirm the importance of not undermining the stability of the gold standard.</p>
<p>(3) All countries agree to focus on the goals of the World Economic Conference, namely the eventual restoration of the gold standard.</p>
<p>It has now been agreed that once formal US presidential approval is received, British Prime Minister MacDonald will invite the chief representatives to 10 Downing Street to sign the declaration. The wording of the declaration will reportedly allow the United States to freely implement its monetary policy, with central banks merely declaring war on speculators.</p>
<p>In the event that the United States is unwilling to join the joint declaration, it is reported that the gold standard countries will form a strong gold bloc and, under any agreement, the gold standard will maintain its position through a joint declaration.</p>
<p>The situation today is extremely tense, and even Chairman MacDonald is deeply concerned about the conference's breakdown. It is said that MacDonald is considering inviting all European foreign ministers to London next week to join an expanded conference to intensify the work. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the declaration discussed by the gold bloc also contains a general expression of hope that central banks will take joint action to curb currency speculation. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Discussions on the issue of currency stabilization have entered a new phase today. Representatives from all countries, including the US, have agreed on common language regarding the gold issue. This proposal has now been sent to President Roosevelt. It is reported that the President is insisting on revisions regarding the stabilization section. The conference has been extended to tomorrow to await the President's response. The main points of the proposal put forward by the gold bloc are as follows: All countries currently on the gold standard must maintain it, and countries that have abandoned the gold standard should restore it when possible. As for the stability ratio and the stability period, each country must decide for itself. Currently, gold standard countries are firmly determined to strive to maintain their position, and countries with depreciated currencies support the position taken by the gold standard countries. The language of the gold proposal is the result of a day-long effort to reconcile differing views. Representatives of the gold bloc discussed for a long time in the afternoon. The final draft was studied by US representative Professor Moley, French Finance Minister Bonnet, Italian Finance Minister Jung, and British government economic advisor Ross. Everyone believes that a declaration in which the United States can participate is more valuable than a purely European declaration. Representatives from various countries held closed-door meetings with their experts to discuss this matter. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) As of 11 a.m. this morning, the President of the United States had not yet responded to the latest proposal to curb exchange rate speculation. It is reported that the gold standard countries are prepared to continue discussions tentatively at the end of this week and are unlikely to meet again before Monday. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times correspondent summarized President Roosevelt's views as follows: (1) The dollar has not rotated. (2) The dollar has not fallen to a level where its price can be appropriately stabilized. (3) The position of the United States in the World Economic Conference will be harmed by fixing the dollar price at this time. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The world is eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's judgment on the currency plan, knowing that the future of the Economic Conference and the prospects for European stability depend on it. The proposed declaration is not related to currency stabilization but aims to curb speculation. The gold bloc initially demanded immediate stabilization of currency prices, which the US and Britain opposed. The gold bloc has now agreed to change its attitude because of the proposal for international unanimity in rejecting speculation. It seems that President Roosevelt may be willing to have the Federal Reserve Bank work to curb speculation in the foreign exchange market, so as to avoid violent fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate. Professor Moley has already approved the compromise plan now submitted to the President, so the President should approve today the proposal that the central banks of various countries should use their power to curb speculation. If the United States accepts this declaration, the governments of various countries will eventually decide the timing of currency stabilization, or at present, but this period is of course not yet negotiable. The US delegation did not participate in yesterday's negotiations, indicating that the US representatives believe that the attitude of the United States on this issue is not within the purview of the US delegation. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The plan to resolve the currency crisis was telegraphed to President Roosevelt yesterday. Representatives from various countries at the World Economic Conference are now awaiting his response. It is expected that the reply will arrive tonight, at which time British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon may convene a meeting of the gold bloc and other related countries to consider the reply. The content of the reply has aroused general speculation. The US delegation in London believes that the President will revise the plan and not focus too much on gold. The President will express his sympathy for the gold bloc but will not express concrete views on the gold standard. The foreign exchange market was not affected by the expectation of a satisfactory reply. Transactions proceeded as usual on Saturday morning and closed very late. Dollar trading was suddenly active, with many sales. The market closed half an hour later than usual. The dollar exchange rate opened at $4.275, then weakened and fell to $4.33. Near the close, the price recovered slightly to $4.3175. All gold coins were extremely stable. According to Reuters Paris, regardless of the President's reply, the French government clearly expressed its position at this morning's cabinet meeting. After considering Finance Minister Bonnet's report, the Cabinet reiterated its position that nothing can be achieved in the economic scope of the Economic Conference without currency stability. There was no meeting of the conference today, so the Geological Museum was sparsely populated today, but representatives from several countries took the opportunity to explain their positions. The most important was the speech by the Mexican representative, who argued that silver should be a supplementary coin to gold and that silver should not be regarded merely as a commodity, as France has suggested, but that all silver issues should be submitted to the Monetary and Financial Committee for handling. French newspapers have generally sympathetic views towards England, acknowledging that England is in a difficult position on the currency issue. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(London) According to a telegram from New York last night, Professor Moley, a close advisor to the US President, has recommended to the President that he approve the approach of the gold standard countries, namely that the central banks of various countries should use all their power to prevent extreme fluctuations in currency. It is generally believed that the President will announce his support for this approach today. The World Economic Conference virtually suspended its various important activities yesterday, with all representatives awaiting President Roosevelt's announcement of his attitude towards the UK and European countries' efforts to curb currency speculation and prevent violent fluctuations in the dollar.

<p>President Roosevelt's Statement</p>
<p>Campobello Island When reporters asked President Roosevelt about reports from British officials in London that the President supported an agreement to prevent violent currency fluctuations, the President reportedly replied that temporary stabilization was a matter for the banks, not a government problem, and was not within the scope of the World Economic Conference. Furthermore, the stabilization issue was extremely complex and could not be resolved by the Economic Conference in a few days or weeks. At the same time, he believed that dollar fluctuations would not hinder the US domestic economy. The President expressed doubts about whether gold bloc countries could maintain their position and whether currencies should have permanent stability before they were free to find their true prices. The President believes that, as far as the United States is concerned, the stabilization issue can be temporarily shelved until the Economic Conference achieves other goals, but it is noteworthy that the President did not express opposition to informal cooperation among central banks to reduce fluctuations.

<p>(New York) After Treasury Secretary Woodin held an important meeting at his residence yesterday, it is generally believed today that the authorities have developed a plan to temporarily ease currency fluctuations, but not to fix currency prices. This will be done jointly by the New York Federal Reserve Bank and foreign central banks. Participants in yesterday's meeting included senior officials of the Federal Reserve Bank and foreign exchange directors. Today, an official said that there is no need to allocate special funds to prevent the rotation of currency prices. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(Paris) Although the financial newspapers here have not received clear news, they are generally confident that the central banks of England and France have decided to work together to thwart speculators' manipulation of the Dutch currency and to slow the outflow of foreign capital from the Netherlands. Currently, Dutch currency is being purchased in Paris, and London's Exchange Equalisation Account is purchasing francs in large quantities, so that the de facto stability between the major European currencies can be maintained.

<p>(Tokyo) At the subcommittee of the World Economic Conference on the 27th, the Cuban representative proposed two proposals for limiting sugar production: (1) no increase in sugar production for the next ten years; (2) no new sugar factories to be established for the next ten years. At that time, the chairman of the meeting asked Japan for its opinion. The Japanese delegation immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following reply today: (1) Japan did not participate in the 1931 Brazilian proposal to limit the export of major sugar-producing countries because it was a producing country and limited to domestic consumption. (2) The recent request from the Brazilian International Sugar Alliance was also rejected. (3) If the purpose of the proposal is to control exports and stabilize prices, Japan does not need to participate. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>

These negotiations may include non-aggression covenants. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu are making the most efforts. It is generally speculated that the territorial issue of Bessarabia on the Russian border may be resolved. Negotiations appear to be making considerable progress, and an agreement may be signed by the end of this week. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e71">US Treasury Deficit <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>New Fiscal Year Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>National Tax Revenue Expected to Increase Sharply</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government's old fiscal year ended today, with the deficit being the second largest in history during peacetime. However, after the new year begins tomorrow, national tax revenue is expected to increase with the gradual revival of industry and commerce. The government's monthly income from liquor taxes alone now exceeds $10 million. Since the Democratic Party took office, in the old fiscal year, only four months, the total government expenditure for the year was $3,950,000,000, while revenue was only $2,200,000,000, resulting in a deficit of $1,750,000,000. National public debt has increased to $22,500,000,000, the highest amount since 1922. In addition, there is a total of $124,969,983,000 allocated to the Financial Reconstruction Corporation, which is not included in the amount of the Treasury deficit. This amount is actually equal to public debt, but the Ministry of Finance considers it to be of an active nature and therefore does not consider it appropriate to include it in the amount of public debt.

But who would have known that the inventor of movies, after presenting his invention to the world in 1895 and premiering it in Berlin to great acclaim, eventually abandoned his business due to a lack of funds to improve it, allowing others to continue research based on his invention, perfecting it, and profiting immeasurably? Isn't this extremely heartbreaking? Who is this person? It is the German Skladanowsky. He has been living in obscurity in the Pankow district of Berlin for a long time. He was only found a few days ago by Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, as the film industry also belongs to the Propaganda Department. Members of the National Socialist Party in the Pankow City Council have now organized a committee and published a donation appeal in the newspaper, asking the public to help fund the effort to reward this German inventor for his labor and to comfort him in his old age.</p>

<p>Air Minister Leads 24 Expeditionary Aircraft</p>
<p>Crossing Mountains and Oceans to Tour the Chicago World's Fair</p>
<p>One Crashes in the Netherlands, Killing One and Injuring Four</p>
<p>(National Telegram from Austantai on the 1st) As the Italian air force squadron of 24 planes bound for the Chicago World's Fair took off this morning, 3,000 Italians bid them farewell. Air Minister Balbo told reporters before his departure: "I am confident that this trip will be successful. Next time, we will make a round-the-world flight." At dawn this morning, the 24 expeditionary aircraft were lined up on the lake. The instructors of the Naval Academy were busy with final preparations. After the pilots had breakfast at 4:15 a.m., they gathered at the pier. Then Commander Cagna and General Balbo joined them. The military band played the Fascist Party song, the sailors raised the national flag, and after the men saluted, they boarded the gasoline tankers in an orderly fashion amidst cheers from the crowd and said goodbye. Balbo, who was the last to board the ship, shouted, "Long live the country! Long live the king! Long live the prime minister!" At 4:45 a.m., the pilots uncovered the engine covers and took off. Balbo's plane was the first to take off, followed quickly by the others. Within 20 minutes, all 24 planes had left the water, circled several times, and headed for the Alps. In addition to Air Minister General Balbo, Commander Cagna, General Val, and Commander Lang were also in joint command. After receiving the latest weather news, Balbo said that he would fly over the Argentaio Mountains and would be able to reach Amsterdam within six hours. The route would pass through Genoa and Milan, cross the Spruggia Pass in the Alps, and then pass through Zurich and Basel to Amsterdam. The entire route will be divided into six legs: (1) From Austantai to Amsterdam, 750 miles; (2) From Amsterdam across the North Sea to London (Tiley), 525 miles; (3) From London (Tiley) across the Atlantic to Reykjavik, Iceland, 800 miles; (4) From Reykjavik across the Atlantic to Sandwich Bay, Labrador, 1,500 miles; (5) From Sandwich Bay to Montreal, Canada, 1,000 miles; (6) From Montreal to Chicago, 800 miles. The return journey will take the southern route across the Atlantic, passing through New York, the Azores, and Spain. The main purpose of this trip is to show that the Italian air force can make long voyages in a relatively short period of time and with scientific preparation. Beforehand, personnel were sent to the countries that were planned to be passed through to study the weather and aviation situation for nearly two years. After that, meteorological measurements were taken along the way for several months, which shows the thoroughness of the preparation. As for temporary support, four Italian destroyers were dispatched to patrol between Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland, and two submarines and two steam tugs were dispatched to patrol between Iceland and Labrador.</p>
<p>(National Telegram from Amsterdam on the 1st) When the Italian air force squadron arrived here this afternoon, one of the aircraft of the third group, the Red Team's Udine, crashed while landing, killing one and injuring four. The remaining 23 planes landed safely. Air Minister Balbo, who was on the plane, was the first to arrive at 1:02 p.m. Then the planes came one after another. Within three minutes, a total of 16 planes landed safely on the water. The 17th plane was the ill-fated Udine. The last plane arrived at 1:15 p.m. When the Udine landed, the nose suddenly touched the water first. Then the fuselage overturned and the entire plane split apart, with the wooden frame also cracking. One person in the plane drowned after being trapped in the cabin, and the body has not yet been recovered. The remaining four people were injured and were rescued by small boats.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Prague) A Czech newspaper has compiled a list of the world's most diligent homemakers, but British women are notably absent. It is said that because British women do not pay much attention to housekeeping, it is difficult to calculate the time they spend working each week. Swiss women are the most diligent in housekeeping in the world, working 16 to 17 hours a day. American women like music and only work 68 hours a week, spending about 10 hours a day on housekeeping. The newspaper also said that since the introduction of electricity, coal, and various conveniences into the home, the amount of time modern women spend on housework has been greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Berlin Telegram, 30th of the Month. German President Hindenburg sent a letter to Prime Minister Hitler today, stating that recent efforts by the "German Christians" within the National Socialist Party to impose their will upon the church's doctrines and regulations have caused deep distress among the authorities of the Protestant Church and the general Protestant population, who are witnessing the impact of this political turmoil on the church. Hindenburg further stated that recent disputes between Prussia and church leaders have caused him, as a Christian and head of state, to feel extremely uneasy. "The numerous letters and telegrams I have received recently have proven the shock felt by Protestants due to this controversy. If this situation, with its suppression of spiritual freedom, is allowed to persist, the nation and the fatherland will suffer severely, and the integrity of the state will be compromised. Therefore, I am compelled by my conscience to believe that rescuing this crisis is to uphold God's will. Yesterday, I met with you, and fortunately, you deeply understand this crisis. Therefore, I dare to believe that with your far-sighted political vision, you will be able to use mediation to enable the conflicting representatives within the church and the relevant state organs to work towards the restoration of peace within the church and the integrity of the state."</p>
<p>According to public announcements, after receiving this letter, Hitler immediately ordered Interior Minister Dr. Frick to follow President Hindenburg's wishes and begin mediation efforts. What the future holds for the Catholic Center Party, which the National Socialist Party considers the only obstacle to "German unity," remains undecided. Deliberations among the party's leaders and consultations between its representatives and government authorities are still ongoing today. However, according to those familiar with the details, the current negotiations are no longer about the party's existence but about how its members can join the National Socialist Party. The party's continued existence is considered an irreversible fact.</p>

<p>Vienna Telegram, 30th of the Month. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss declared today that he intends to use the same methods employed by Prime Minister Hitler in Germany to suppress opposition parties to suppress the National Socialist Party in Austria. These strict new regulations will affect all industries and businesses nationwide. From now on, any industry or business must obtain a license. If anyone directly or indirectly promotes National Socialism or Communism in writing or in action, their license will be revoked. To rigorously enforce this ban, Dollfuss has organized an emergency team throughout the country. These team members are loyal and reliable in any emergency. Before joining the team, their daily beliefs must be investigated. Upon joining, they must take an oath to respond within one minute if summoned by the government. Dollfuss has submitted this plan to the cabinet, which immediately passed it, authorizing Dollfuss to issue orders for its implementation. Furthermore, complete control of newspapers is also part of Dollfuss's overall plan. From now on, newspapers will be forced to publish all government announcements and statements so that the people can always be informed of government actions.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Regulations for Flood Prevention Funds in Anhui Province Determined <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Embankment of Crab Shoal in Fanchang County Collapses</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication. The river tide in Wuhu has not risen or fallen much in recent days, remaining at 27 feet 6 inches. However, due to rain and mountain floods in the inland rivers, the water level in the streets has been rising by one or two inches each day. As a result, the dikes and embankments in the surrounding villages are in imminent danger. Several alarms are reported to the county government every day, and the county government has telegraphed various dike construction associations to strengthen their defenses to prevent collapses. However, the embankment of Crab Shoal in Fanchang County, Anhui Province, suddenly reported an emergency on the 28th, with a breach of over a hundred and several tens of feet long. The embankment is located on the Yangtze River, about thirty miles from Wuhu. The fields within the embankment are extensive. At that time, the situation was extremely serious. County Magistrate Wang Huai of the county went to rescue it in person and rushed to Wuhu to report to the Jiangxi Engineering Bureau and the Second District Administrative Commissioner's Office, requesting assistance. Lin Youlong, the director of the Engineering Bureau, dispatched engineers Ke Tingzhong and Feng Bingxiang to purchase a large amount of reed mats and tree trunks, which were towed by special ships to rescue it, together with the Fanchang fellow villagers in Wuhu. Liu Yiyan, the director of the Anhui Construction Department, had gone to Hangzhou to participate in the opening of the three-province highway and rushed back yesterday. It is said that the flood prevention funds for Anhui Province have been set at 50,000 yuan, and a request for a subsidy of 200,000 yuan from the central government has been approved. Liu returned to the province yesterday afternoon (June 29).</p>

<h3 id="e87">Procedures for Taking Over War Zones <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Prerequisites After the Establishment of the Takeover Committee</p>
<p>The Most Important Things are the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops and the Disposal of Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Ping Telegram. Although there is still no concrete and definite solution to the Rehe problem, the Japanese withdrawal is only a matter of time. The discussion of reorganization with Li Jichun and others must also have its feasible plan. Taking over the war zone is now the top priority and must be carried out by our side. Therefore, an organization of the takeover committee has been established here and is scheduled to be established on July 1.</p>
<p>The war zone belongs to Hebei Province. Therefore, all arrangements and expenses for the takeover should be borne by the Hebei Provincial Government. The takeover committee has a total of nine members, with Yu Xuezhong as the chairman. As the chairman of Hebei, he should have the responsibility of command. Secondly, Wei Jian, the director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, is appointed as the county magistrate and is in charge by Wei. The above two belong to the provincial government. In addition, there are four people belonging to the Political Affairs Committee: Xue Zhiheng, Li Zeyi, Yin Tong, and Liu Shisun. There are two people belonging to the military branch: Tao Shangming and Lei Shourong. There is one person belonging to the transportation aspect: Qian Zongze. If the most suitable distribution of duties is the reorganization, then Yu Xuezhong, Xue Zhiheng, Yin Tong, Lei Shourong, and Liu Shisun bear more responsibility. Secondly, the takeover belongs to Wei Jian, transportation belongs to Qian Zongze and Liu Shisun, guiding the county magistrate belongs to Tao Shangming and Yin Tong, and all contacts belong to Li Zeyi. Each does his best and is suitable for his strengths. The meeting place is set in Tianjin, and the meeting period is until the end of the takeover. The work of the takeover committee is roughly like this.</p>
<p>As for the brief history of the nine members, Yu is the chairman, Wei is the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xue Zhiheng is a veteran of the Beiping police circle. He can be very helpful in the reorganization. Li Zeyi is the secretary of the Political Affairs Committee, Yin Tong is a graduate of the military academy, and He Huang are known to be close friends. Liu Shisun is also a graduate of studying in Japan and is also a member of the Political Affairs Committee. Tao Shangming has been working in the Northeast for a long time and was the former foreign affairs section chief of the Northeast. Lei Shourong is also a graduate of the military academy and a staff officer of the General Staff Headquarters. This time, he works in the military branch. Qian Zongze is the vice minister of the Ministry of Railways and the director of the Beining Longhai Railway. Among them, Yin and Liu have been out of officialdom for a long time. This conscription shows their enthusiasm even more.</p>
<p>Once the takeover committee is established, it should proceed with the takeover. There are two prerequisites for the takeover: (1) the withdrawal of Japanese troops; (2) the solution of Li Jichun's troops. If these two things are ready, then the county magistrates will lead the police to take office. After that, everything is just an administrative problem. Therefore, this meeting is called a takeover, but in fact, the more important task is to solve these prerequisites. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the original agreement did not limit the date, so it has been delayed. However, at present, the front line has begun to withdraw. However, in military terms, one side withdraws and the other side takes over. There is a need for mutual connection and response. Therefore, those who are prepared to take over must first know the procedures and locations of those who withdraw. Since the Japanese troops began to withdraw, our side has not deeply understood their withdrawal plan. Therefore, it is also very inconvenient to take over. If Japan and I were in combat, we would do our best and drive straight into Ping and have more than enough. However, it is precisely because there must be reasons why they did not enter Ping and could not sustain the war that they reined in on the precipice. Today, the agreement has been reached. Whether it is a gain or loss, let's put it aside. However, since there is an agreement, why not make the withdrawal and takeover seamlessly connected to avoid sudden incidents during the transfer? However, after the agreement was reached, for a month now, the steps of the other party's withdrawal have not been carefully studied, so there is no way to suspend the plan for our takeover. The takeover committee now wants to take over. This is the first thing to start with.</p>
<p>As for Li Jichun's troops, negotiations have been held until now. Whether to reorganize or dismiss them, as long as it is beneficial to the matter, there is no fixed and unchangeable plan. In terms of the number of people, it is said to be tens of thousands, but according to those who know the inside story, it is probably no more than ten thousand. Since suppression has failed, we will seek appeasement. The way to appease is to reorganize or dismiss them. This should be discussed separately according to the situation of each part. However, if they can safely comply, serve the country, and defend the people, then reorganization may not be impossible. However, how will the leader, such as Li Jichun, be dealt with so that he will not cause more trouble? Therefore, only when the method of Li Jichun is determined will the county magistrate be able to take over after the Japanese troops withdraw. This is another important task that the committee should carry out at the same time.</p>
<p>After the great chaos, the people are extremely devastated. The public security in various places is very important. Moreover, these nineteen counties are not allowed to station troops, and the banditry must be prevented. Since there is no military agency, everything is in the administrative aspect. The official who is close to the people is the county magistrate. Therefore, the provincial government has selected capable and virtuous people to serve as county magistrates. These nineteen counties will be taken over. During the takeover and after the takeover, there must be special attention. The takeover personnel should guide them separately so as not to disrupt the overall plan due to small impatience, causing more suffering to the people and causing disputes. Therefore, the takeover committee is also an important task to guide the county magistrates in the special circumstances and special environments of these nineteen counties (June 29, Xiao).</p>
<h3 id="e88">Prelude to the Great War in Sichuan Province <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Appoints Six Route Commanders</p>
<p>And Orders the Levying of 3 Million in Housing Donations</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication. Liu's troops in Sichuan Province have been moving eastward one after another. The troops of Chen Hongwen, Yang Shuxian, Zheng Yongnian, Ye Guanying, and others are concentrated in Jianyang. The troops of Lin Meipo, Chen Xinmin, Shi Shaowu, Zhao Wanqin, Li Yushu, and others are concentrated in Renshou Bingyan. Zhang Chongmin's troops are concentrated in Wutongqiao, Yu Zhongying's troops are concentrated in Jiading, and two brigades of Zhang Qingping's troops are concentrated in the Zhuyuanpu area. The troops in various places are very busy preparing for war and have appointed commanders for each route. Xia Zhongbao of Jiading is the commander of the first route, Lin Yungen of Renshou is the commander of the second route, Chen Hongwen of Jianyang is the commander of the third route, and Zhang Lengtang of Chengdu Northwest is the commander of the fourth, fifth, and sixth routes. The eight brigades stationed in Jiading crossed the Min River on the 25th and were deployed in the areas of Heerkan, Malujing, and Sanjiangzhen. Zhang Zhifang's troops in Huangtuan also moved from Niuhuaxi to the Wangcun Jinshan Temple area. There is a great tendency to launch the arrow on the string. However, economic and military matters are extremely difficult. Therefore, Liu ordered Wen Hesheng (the former director of the Finance Department and the current director of Liu's management office) to levy 3 million in housing donations in the provincial capital and limit it to be paid within ten days. The urging of donations is very urgent. All garrison area grain taxes will be pre-collected for three years starting this month. The ordnance factory has stopped night work due to lack of raw materials. The people's army against donations has been repeatedly suppressed and risen again. In this situation, although Liu Wenhui believes in force, I am afraid that there is no certainty in military matters (National News Agency).</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Situation in Chahar Province is Being Resolved <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Hopes That Feng Will Cancel the Allied Army</p>
<p>Deng Zhexi is Busy on the Road to Beiping and Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Beiping Special Telegram. Regarding the issue of Chahar Province, since Deng Zhexi was ordered by Feng to go to Ping, he has been running around to make contacts in recent days. Feng has extreme hopes that Song Zheyuan will return to Chahar immediately to preside over the government affairs, but he has not abandoned the anti-Japanese military affairs. Ji Hongchang has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the northern front and has led his troops to Zhangbei. Fang Zhenwu is still living in the library of Tu'ergou, Zhangyuan. The headquarters of the northern front of Hebei is located there. Feng convened meetings with various generals in Xincun for several days. Liu Guitang has sent representatives Shang Wu to Zhangyuan and Zhangbei to visit Feng Fangji to discuss military affairs. Liu has given up Bao and Deng Wenli's troops have been opened to station. Liu's troops are currently stationed in Guyuan, Baochang, and other areas. Feng has not heard of the cancellation of the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. The Central Government has now understood Liu Guitang's surrender this time. The recovery of the lost land in eastern Chahar Province is considered necessary for the government to be responsible for the military and political affairs of Chahar Province to do its best. Therefore, the appointment of Sun Dianying as the Director of Tunkun in the Qingxin Border Area has been sent to Beiping this morning (29th). Wang Shouxin, the director of Sun's office in Ping, forwarded the telegram to Sun. Sun's 80,000 troops have been properly arranged. As for Fang Zhenwu's troops, it is still planned to appoint Fang as the co-organizer of the National Forest Reclamation Association and move the troops to cultivate. As for Feng's directly administered troops and the righteous troops of various routes, it will also be decided to place them separately. The purpose of the embrace has not changed. After Deng Zhexi arrived in Ping, he stated Feng's opinions to all parties, and most of them have understood. Song Zheyuan met with Deng again last night (28th), and Song said that if Feng cancels the title, he can lead his troops back to Chahar. He is still working hard to close the customs. That night, Qin Dechun also invited Deng to his private house to discuss with Xiong Bin and others in detail. Then Qin and Xiong went to Jurentang to meet He Yingqin and report everything. He still hoped that Feng would immediately revoke the title of the Allied Army and take up the post of Director of National Forest Reclamation so that Song Zheyuan could leave as soon as possible. After Qin left, he had another meeting with Deng Zhexi and conveyed He's intentions one by one. Deng immediately sent a telegram to Feng to ask for instructions. The reply telegram has not arrived in Ping until now (29th) evening. Therefore, Deng is scheduled to go to Zhang tomorrow (30th) afternoon to report to Feng. Qin will not enter Chahar for the time being. It is rumored that Qin has the power to govern Chahar, thinking that it is a transition, which is not a fact. Yan Xishan sent a telegram from Hebian Village to Ping, saying that he has repeatedly telegraphed Feng to advise him. Feng replied in a telegram that it was definitely not internal and that there was no intention to resist the government. Generally speaking, the solution of the Chahar issue is still pending (June 29).</p>
<h3 id="e90">Disasters of Great Floods in Various Counties of Jiangxi Province <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yongxiu, Hukou, and Xin Jian Counties are the Most Severe</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication. Continuous rain and mountain floods have caused the rivers in Jiangxi to rise sharply at times. According to the report of the hydrological station, the water level is only seven inches lower than the highest water level in the twentieth year. Fortunately, the dikes and embankments in various places have been built firmly in advance, and no major disasters have occurred. Since the water from the Yangtze River flowed back into Poyang Lake, the lake water flowed into the tails of the Ganfu Rivers, and the water勢 was rising against the stream, and the floodwater was larger than the upper water, so the upstream areas such as Xingan, Qingjiang, Fengcheng, and the southern part of Nanxin were not affected by the disaster, while Nanchang, Jiujiang, Poyang, Hukou, Zhangshu, Yongxiu, Dean, Wanzai, and other counties have been flooded in many places, especially Yongxiu, where the collapse産 is the largest. Xinjian and Hukou counties are the second largest, and Poyang is still struggling to rescue them. In Jiujiang along the river, Longkai River, Sanma Road, and Dazhong Road have also been flooded. The Water Conservancy and Water Conservancy Bureau has dispatched flood control personnel to carry materials such as cash, wooden piles, sacks, and torches to various counties for rescue. The disaster situation in the counties with heavier water disasters is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Yongxiu County has become a country of Ze, and the Qingzhu, Liaofang, Yongshou, and other dikes in the second district, the Makou, Yangsi, Xiayang, and other dikes in the third district, and the Baijing Dike in the sixth district, a total of more than 20 dikes, have been flooded with more than 100,000 acres of farmland, and countless houses and livestock have been washed away. After several days and nights of rescue, the Sanjiao, Guodong, and Yongxing dikes were fortunately preserved, but they have not been completely out of danger. The current water势 is very large, only a foot lower than the amount of water in the twentieth year. The Yongwu road stone work has been completed eight or nine, and the Ma灣 and Baicha sections are too low, and the soil has been cultivated by more than ten feet, and they have been submerged. The repairs have just been completed, and they have been washed down again.</p>
<p>The lake water overflows all over Hukou Lake, and the gates of the county seat are all sealed by water. Small boats are on the streets, and the water depth is more than three feet. The houses inside and outside the ground floor have been flooded. The terrain in the countryside is lower, and most of them have been flooded. In Jiujiang, Baixi, Jiaoshan, Qingni, Fanyi Tangmai, Caijia, Yangjia, and other dikes in Poyang County have collapsed one after another, and even the area near the city river street has become a country of Ze. It is still increasing sharply in recent days and has invaded the main street. In addition to ordering the dike construction committee to send people to various dikes to carry out surveys and ordering the dikes to try to remedy them, the county authorities are selecting places to settle the victims, ordering the police to strictly prevent the Red bandits from taking the opportunity to disturb them, and issuing a notice to merchants not to increase the price of rice to maintain the food supply of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Memorial Service Held in Baoding <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Venue is Tragic and Solemn</p>
<p>The Military and Civilians Mourn the National Trauma</p>
<p>Baoding Communication. After many days of preparation, the memorial service for the fallen soldiers who died in the Anti-Japanese War was held yesterday (the 25th) at the Lotus Pond Theater. About 4,000 people from military, political, police, institutions, groups, schools, and private individuals in the city participated. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the venue, there are military police maintaining order. The layout inside the venue is tragic and solemn. The surroundings are full of elegiac couplets, wreaths, and sacrificial flags from all walks of life. Jiang Zhongzheng's elegiac couplet says, "The righteousness is left in two simple, and the sincerity has been used to destroy the enemy. The loyal soul has been fought in hundreds of battles, and I hope that it can fly away and become mountains and rivers." Qian Dajun's elegiac couplet says, "Like your great integrity and loyalty, life is not vain, and death is also without regrets. I wish the country would lie down and taste the eternal remembrance of the martyrs. Don't let down today and wish the commander's elegiac couplet says, "The great ambition will not return, and the sacrifice for the country is without regrets. The great revenge has not been avenged, and the people are rescued from fire and water. Can the residual life have a time to rest?" The elegiac couplet of the Garrison Headquarters says, "Strive for independence for the country and strive for survival for the nation. You gave your lives to become benevolent, leaving a good name to be admired. Let us clear out the Communist Party and execute the traitors. I will inherit the legacy and will take back the lost land." The elegiac couplet of the Supplementary Soldiers Training Office says, "The more I add sorrow to the mourning, the more I hear the shouts and charges, regardless of the bursting brains and liver, and the flowing red blood. There is no other strategy for revenge, only sacrifice and struggle. The traces are last year in Shanghai and this year in the Great Wall."</p>
<p>After the participating groups of military police arrived, the meeting began at about 9 o'clock. First, play the elegy, then pay the last salute to the fallen soldiers, and be silent for five minutes for the fallen soldiers. Secondly, the chief priest Qian Dajun read the sacrificial text, and the representative of the preparatory committee read the sacrificial text. Then, Qian Dajun, the director of the Baoding camp, delivered a speech, saying that this unconditional invasion of Japan not only violated the peace of the international treaty but also violated human nature too much. Under our unbearable circumstances, we had to take up arms and defend ourselves. Everyone knows that the weapons of the Japanese army are more sophisticated than ours, and the military supplies are very sufficient. Last winter, our generals fought fiercely in the enemy's fierce artillery fire, starving and enduring the cold, and fighting each other. Although the weapons are not as good as them, the spirit is not weaker than the enemy. This shows that our conscience is not dead, and our ambition still exists. The fallen soldiers were able to sacrifice for the existence of the country and the personality of the nation. The greatness of their personality and the greatness of their spirit will be passed down to thousands of years. Then, Zhang, the representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Memorial Service for the Fallen Soldiers, delivered a speech, saying that in this war, Japan ignored everything, fish and meat in North China, and came to invade with violence and barbarity. The past facts are known to everyone. I have repeatedly questioned the facts of the invasion in the international community, waiting for a public solution. Unexpectedly, after the determination, Japan was still unrepentant and became more and more rampant, harassing North China and coveting Tianjin. We were forced to resist and defend ourselves. However, this anti-Japanese war is related to the survival of the country and the nation, and we should work together with one heart, do our best, and divide our work and cooperate. Now that the martyrs have been the vanguard for the people, resisting the strong and sacrificing their lives for the country, their responsibility has been fulfilled. The part left behind should be borne by everyone. We mourn the fallen soldiers. How can we not disappoint their hard work in the future? Finally, representatives from Commander Zhu, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, and the 19th Route Army Suiying School gave speeches in turn. The meeting ended at 12 o'clock with slogans (26th).</p>
<h3 id="e92">Hunan Province's Extreme Austerity Measures <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Cutting a Large Number of Institutions and Wasteful Expenses</p>
<p>Saving Over One Million Yuan Annually</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the abolition of consolidated taxes, Hunan Province's finances have become increasingly difficult. With the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, all industries have declined, tax revenues have fallen short, grain prices have plummeted, and rural areas have gone bankrupt. Consequently, the situation has become even more dire, a condition rarely seen in the past decade or two. Party and government expenses have been allocated every ten days in recent years, with only 10% being disbursed each time. Since June, this has changed to every half month, with only 15% being disbursed each time. As of June 15th, only 10% of the November expenses from last year had been allocated. In total, arrears in political expenses will reach eight months, and future difficulties are inevitable. This year's budget for the 22nd year of the Republic for local income and expenditure in the province estimates annual expenditures at over 15 million yuan, while income, excluding the fictitious figure of 2.5 million yuan in public bonds, is less than 10 million yuan. He Jian then proposed implementing extreme austerity measures. In early June, this was presented to the provincial affairs meeting. At that time, committee members had many concerns due to excessive cuts, and advocated that everyone should share the burden. They suggested that all institutions should not be abolished, but that party and government expenses should be temporarily reduced by 30% to provide relief. However, after comprehensive calculation, even with a 30% reduction, the income and expenditure were still short by more than one million yuan. Therefore, at the provincial affairs meeting on the 20th, He again proposed implementing austerity measures, which were passed as proposed, to be implemented from July 1st. In total, 1,125,183 yuan will be saved annually, allowing income and expenditure to be balanced.

<p>Li Jusheng, a farmer near Zhangjiaqiao Town, Mudu Township, is over thirty years old and addicted to gambling, resulting in a heavy debt burden. Yesterday (the 1st), a creditor, Shi Shunnian, demanded repayment of 120 yuan from Li Jusheng. Li had no money to repay, and Shi insisted on collecting the debt, leading to a conflict.

<p>Chen Jifang, the young daughter of Zhengmao Dyeing Shop on Taoxing Bridge in this city, was lured and raped by Liu Gouzi, a dyer from Nanjing, at her sister Xia's residence at the Gexianweng Temple, causing serious injuries. It is now known that the suspect Liu Gouzi secretly returned from outside the South Gate yesterday and was discovered by patrol officer Wang Guohua of the Second Precinct Police Station. He was immediately arrested and taken to the County Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation. He confessed to being 20 years old, previously working as a dyer, but currently unemployed and residing at his sister Xia's house. He denied the rape, claiming that Chen Jifang came to the Gexianweng Temple that day and was running and playing on the coffins in the funeral parlor. He said he tried to stop her and warned her of haunting ghosts, but she didn't listen. He claimed she accidentally fell to the ground, causing the serious injuries. His testimony was extremely cunning. The bureau, noting that the case had already been thoroughly investigated by the prosecutor's office, immediately prepared a document to transfer him to the prosecutor's office for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>The home of Qiu Yinkun in the Eighteenth District of Tinglin was suddenly attacked by over ten bandits on the night of June 28th. They broke down the door and entered to loot.

Unfortunately, she struck a gong, and the bandits, who were still looting, heard the gong and feared the villagers would capture them. They immediately fled, but after checking the losses, a gold ring and over 100 yuan in cash had been stolen. A list of the stolen items has been filed, requesting investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>Shen Peiqi, the former Director of the Yuyu Bureau of this county, had a sister named Peizhen, who is currently 38 years old. She has strange quirks and has been a vegetarian since childhood. Relatives and friends have proposed marriage for her, but she has always refused. Therefore, approaching forty, she is still a virgin. Before her brother Peiqi became the Director of the Education Bureau, Peizhen often provided for him. Two years ago, Peiqi became an editor at the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company and separated from his sister. Peizhen lived alone in the Shen family ancestral hall on North Gate Street in this county. However, recently, her behavior changed drastically. She constantly chanted Buddhist scriptures and frequently talked about committing suicide. Her cohabiting shoemaker tried to persuade and monitor her. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 30th, Peizhen threw herself into the well behind the ancestral hall. People went to draw water and discovered her body. They immediately rescued her, but she had been dead for some time. Her relatives in Shanghai have been notified to urge Shen Peiqi to return and arrange for her burial.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Ma Zhanshan Reports on Meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Ma Stays in Shanghai Temporarily to Handle Aftermath</p>
<p>Hopes for National Unity</p>
<p>Visits Mr. Ma Xiangbo in the Afternoon</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, the newly appointed member of the Military Affairs Commission, returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. Mr. Ma stated that he would be staying in Shanghai for about a month to handle the aftermath of his subordinates and returning refugees. Afterwards, he may travel north. He also recounted his trip to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and his future positions and intentions. A detailed account of Mr. Ma's conversation follows:</p>
<p>Meeting with Chiang: Mr. Ma first stated, "I went to Jiangxi this time to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, first to report on the past situation in the Northeast, and second to discuss the handling of the aftermath of my subordinates. The results were quite satisfactory. Chairman Chiang has decided to first report all the brigades under my command to the central government, which will send personnel to Beiping to inspect them. Then, the troops will be reorganized. Secondly, an investigation will be conducted on the refugees and their families entering the pass, and a report will be submitted to the central government to seek relief. Most of the refugees and their families entering the pass are living in Shanghai, Beiping, and Xinjiang. I have already sent personnel to Beiping to investigate the exact numbers and whether the heads of the families are still alive, have been killed in action, or have been injured. The investigation in Shanghai has also begun. In Xinjiang, I have sent Brigadier General Wu Delin to inspect." Unchanged Anti-Japanese Stance: "During this trip to Jiangxi, I observed that the spirit of the Communist suppression military was very good. It will not be difficult to suppress the Jiangxi bandits. Regarding the anti-Japanese issue, my stance remains unchanged. I will listen to the central government's orders. However, anti-Japanese resistance requires adequate preparation and a comprehensive plan, so it is different from Communist suppression. Therefore, future anti-Japanese work should continue to focus on cultivating strength."</p>
<p>No Intention to Lead Xinjiang: "Regarding the rumors that I will be appointed chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Chairman Chiang did mention this issue to me in Nanchang. However, because the aftermath of my subordinates needs to be handled urgently, I did not express any opinion. As for the central government's appointment of me as a member of the Military Affairs Commission, I only saw it in the newspapers and have not received a formal appointment. But my personal aspiration is to continue the anti-Japanese cause and remain true to my original intentions. I have no intention of taking on other political duties at the moment."</p>
<p>Regarding Feng Yuxiang: When reporters asked about his thoughts on Feng Yuxiang's recent actions in Zhangjiakou, Ma said, "I absolutely sympathize with Mr. Feng's anti-Japanese stance. My stance has always been to advocate for anti-Japanese resistance, so we can be said to be standing on the same front. However, if someone uses the name of anti-Japanese resistance but has other intentions, then I certainly cannot agree. People's hearts are different, just like their faces, and it is impossible to know. As for Deng Wen and Li Haiqing, I have not received reports on the situation in Chahar, so I cannot speculate."</p>
<p>Impressions of the War Zone: "After returning to Shanghai, I visited the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong. I deeply felt the cruelty of the Japanese army, which is even more brutal than what they inflicted on the Northeast. The devastation is great and the pain is deep. The Northeast and the Battle of Shanghai both demonstrate the enemy's brutality, making them enemies of the world. However, in terms of our country's losses, Shanghai's buildings were completely destroyed due to its urban nature, while the people of the Northeast were massacred. The enemy's brutality is the same."</p>
<p>Not Going to Southeast Asia: "The reports in the newspapers that I will be going to Southeast Asia to raise funds are inaccurate. When I was in Nanchang, I spoke with Mr. Xu Shiying about relief for Northeast refugees and other relief situations. I mentioned that I would like to serve charitable causes in the future, so that is where the rumors came from. But it does not mean that I will personally go to Southeast Asia to raise funds."</p>
<p>India as a Cautionary Tale: Mr. Ma concluded his responses to reporters by expressing his hope that the divide between the Southwest and the central government could be resolved quickly. "Because we are in a dangerous period of national crisis, we should quickly unite and thoroughly awaken to find a way to save ourselves. When I returned to China from Europe, I had a feeling while passing through India. India is also a large nation, similar to us. However, after India's subjugation, its internal strife still exists. Compared to China's current situation, there is a similar danger. Therefore, I believe that everyone should thoroughly awaken to the divide between the Southwest and the central government, so that there is hope for the country's future. Otherwise, we may not be able to avoid following in India's footsteps."</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai Temporarily: Mr. Ma also stated, "My only task during this return to Shanghai is to handle the aftermath of my subordinates. Therefore, I will be staying in Shanghai for about a month to focus on handling the aftermath. After it is completed, I may travel north. Su Bingwen has gone to Hangzhou to visit his wife and children and has not yet determined when he will return to Shanghai."</p>
<p>Visiting Ma Xiangbo: After lunch yesterday, at 12:45 PM, Mr. Ma, accompanied by Zhang Dianjiu, went to Mr. Ma Xiangbo's residence on Xujiahui Road to visit the 94-year-old. He expressed his gratitude to Mr. Ma for his previous comments and spiritual support during the anti-Japanese resistance in the Northeast. The three men spoke for about an hour. Mr. Ma gave a detailed account of the anti-Japanese situation, and Mr. Ma praised his heroic patriotism. They took a photo together to commemorate the occasion. After leaving, Mr. Ma and Zhang turned to the French Concession to visit Yang Hu, talked for about half an hour, and returned to his residence after a brief walk in the Hardoon Garden at three o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Representatives of Merchants and Residents of North Sichuan Road Request Mediation by Councillors Shi, Yu, and Wang Yesterday Regarding the House Tax Case <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Released Yesterday</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency: The entire merchant and resident community of the North Sichuan Road extraterritorial road extension, due to Councillors Shi Liangcai, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Council also being executive and supervisory committee members of the Citizens' Federation, and having connections with both parties, believed that they could properly mediate the house tax issue. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, they elected representatives Chen Jiufeng, Wei Langxuan, Li Zifeng, Guan Jichuan, and Hu Zhaoying to visit Shi and Yu at the Shenbao and Navigation Club to present the situation and request them to serve as mediators. However, they did not meet them. It is reported that they will visit them separately this morning.</p>
<p>The entire merchant and resident community of the North Sichuan Road extraterritorial road extension released a declaration yesterday regarding the request for a delay in the collection of house tax, stating, "Since the North Municipal Tax Collection Office abruptly began collecting house tax without legal procedures or public announcement, the details of the situation have been reported in the newspapers for the past two months. Recently, after reading several statements and talks from the office, we have been accused of resisting taxes, which is harming the citizens. Therefore, we must clearly refute and announce the truth to all citizens and compatriots at home and abroad. Since the day the North Sichuan Road began collecting taxes, the merchants, aware of past events and the devastating state of the market after the war, which has caused burdens to increase without decrease, have written to the Citizens' Federation, a local mass organization, asking the 25th District Branch to act as a mediator, repeatedly explaining the hardships of the North Sichuan Road and the need for a delay in the collection. However, the office director has taken a business-as-usual approach, ignoring right and wrong, and using the house number as the only reason, without examining past events or current difficulties. The citizens, having no other choice, jointly petitioned the municipal government to stop the collection and requested a delay, but there has been no response for two months. Recently, they have been accused of resisting taxes, disregarding the plight of the merchants in dire straits, and showing no understanding. Instead, they are resorting to compulsory enforcement, which is truly unacceptable. The numbering of Chinese houses on North Sichuan Road and the establishment of Chinese police posts were achieved by the masses after they automatically fought for them in 1927. This is the responsibility of the masses, and the house and tax are the obligations of the citizens. However, the masses' repeated requests for a temporary delay are not a sign of resistance. The market has been devastated after the war, which is obvious. Compared to the ratios of the Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan, which burden is lighter and which is heavier? The authorities should investigate. Moreover, the financial bureau's claim of complete facilities is unfounded. The sanitation and police powers of North Sichuan Road are all in the hands of foreigners. The so-called complete facilities include damaged but unrepaired sidewalks and uninstalled street lights. Can this really be called complete? As for the claim that foreigners have also paid some, citing the Yunfei Automobile Company is even more laughable to those in the know. The Yunfei house number is 74 Donghongjiang Road. The supply of water and electricity is supported by facts, and there are also many who have already paid concession taxes. While the people should support the government, the government should also prioritize the well-being of the people. In short, the citizens' request is only for a delay in the collection, and there is absolutely no resistance to taxation. We hope the authorities will investigate carefully and believe that a wise government will not lightly believe one-sided claims and recklessly destroy the survivors of the disaster. That would be fortunate indeed."</p>
<h3 id="e106">The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong Route Changes to a Three-Day Trial Flight <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>First Flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the 7th</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Inaugural Flight Expected to Take About Ten Days</p>
<p>The trial flight and inaugural flight dates for the new Shanghai-Guangdong route of the China National Aviation Corporation have been largely decided after discussions at the company's 20th shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The preparation for the three-day trial flight on the Shanghai-Guangdong route has been underway for a long time. The leasing of airport offices at each station and the installation of electrical equipment have been handled in stages by Director Nie Kaiyi and are now complete. Originally scheduled for daily trial flights, it was changed to a new aircraft trial flight on the third of this month after a report and discussion at the shareholders' meeting held the day before yesterday, stopping at Wenzhou and Xiamen, and then flying directly to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>After the aircraft arrives in Guangzhou on the 7th, it will not fly back immediately. Instead, it will fly from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the 7th for its inaugural flight, initially delivering mail and postponing passenger transport. The inaugural flight period from Shanghai to Guangzhou is expected to be about ten days. In the future, it is planned to have two round-trip flights per week, but the dates have not yet been determined. The company has now printed commemorative envelopes for the opening of the route, which are sold at the company and the Directorate General of Posts. A postmark will also be affixed by the post office at the time of the inaugural flight for commemoration.</p>
<p>Provisional Passenger Fares The provisional passenger fares for the Shanghai-Guangdong route are as follows: From Shanghai to Xiamen, a one-way ticket is 175 silver dollars, and a round-trip ticket is 305 silver dollars. From Shanghai to Guangzhou, a one-way ticket is 270 silver dollars, and a round-trip ticket is 470 silver dollars. The airport and office locations at each station are as follows: (1) Airports: Wenzhou, the water surface in front of the Texaco oil machinery at the West Gate; Xiamen, Danggang; Guangzhou, the river surface. (2) Offices: Wenzhou, inside the Texaco foreign firm at No. 8 Shiban Lane in the city; Xiamen, No. 28, East Gate of Zhongshan Park; Guangzhou, the YMCA on the Bund.</p>
<p>New Aircraft Test Flight The company believes that Shanghai-Guangdong air transport must arrive at the destination on the same day, and it is expected that there will be many passengers between the two places after the route opens. Therefore, after ordering two new Sikorsky aircraft with faster speeds, they were rushed for assembly. One aircraft has now been assembled. Yesterday at 4 p.m., a test flight was conducted, taking off from Longhua Airport, circling the city, flying steadily, and the results were very good.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Implementation of the Regulations on Marking the Country of Origin of Imported Goods is Postponed <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Originally Scheduled to Begin Yesterday</p>
<p>Now Changed to January 1 of Next Year</p>
<p>The Regulations on Marking the Country of Origin of Imported Goods, after being formulated and promulgated by our side, were originally scheduled to take effect yesterday. The Shanghai Customs had already received orders to prepare for the implementation procedures. However, foreign merchants from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany in Shanghai believe that the implementation of these regulations is too hasty and that they have not been given adequate preparation.</p>
<p>The chambers of commerce of each country forwarded a request to our authorities, requesting a postponement of the implementation, so that they could have sufficient time to telegraph export merchants in their respective countries to comply with the marking procedures. According to Shanghai Customs news, after receiving letters from the British, American, and German chambers of commerce, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a meeting and considered the requests of the merchants from various countries to be reasonable. Therefore, they have approved the request to postpone the implementation of the Regulations on Marking the Country of Origin of Imported Goods until January 1 of next year. In addition to issuing a notice to customs offices in various places to comply, they have also sent a letter to the chambers of commerce of various countries in Shanghai to inform them for their reference and compliance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications is Planning Alternative Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai Telephone Company regarding the abolition of the five-cent telephone charge. However, the company's attitude has been firm due to business concerns, and there is no room for concession. The day before yesterday, Director Xu took the night express train to Beijing to personally consult with Minister Zhu for instructions. It is heard that Minister Zhu believes that the five-cent telephone charge is cumbersome and unnecessary in the same city. In order to facilitate users and reduce burdens, he is currently planning alternative measures to achieve the goal of abolishing the charge.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Bureau of Social Affairs Holds a Cooperation Movement Propaganda Week <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Lectures Were Given Yesterday at the YMCA and the People's Education Center</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the World Cooperative Movement. The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs launched a Cooperation Movement Propaganda Week, holding lectures at the Sichuan Road YMCA and the Municipal People's Education Center. Details are reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>Guests attending the YMCA included Zhu Weiyao, representative of the municipal government, Xing Wan, representative of the municipal party headquarters, Lai Kewen, representative of the municipal education bureau, Li Mo, representative of the public security bureau, Yu Zhenhui and Wu Xiaojiu of the municipal farmers' association, Wang Bingquan of the Shanghai Cooperative Enterprise Advancement Association, guests from all walks of life Wang Shiying and Zou Bingwen, and more than 100 employees of the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Wu Xingya (replaced by Zhang Binghui) reported that today is the International Cooperative Movement Anniversary. The origin of this anniversary is that the International Cooperative Alliance stipulated in 1923 that a grand propaganda campaign should be held every year on July 1 to promote the true meaning of cooperation and that this day should be the International Anniversary Day for universal promotion around the world. Therefore, today is the most welcome and encouraging day for cooperative members in various countries and is also the most meaningful day in cooperation. In 1929, the central government stipulated measures for the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week for the purpose of promoting cooperation, ordering provinces and cities to hold it to show their participation in the international cooperative movement. This year, the Bureau is holding an expanded propaganda campaign for the first time in Shanghai. As for the propaganda methods this time, (1) lecture meetings will be held at the People's Education Center and the Sichuan Road YMCA, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan is invited to give a radio broadcast lecture at the China Radio Station; (2) each newspaper will publish a special issue for the commemorative propaganda week today (currently, newspapers printing special issues include Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, etc.), using oral and written propaganda to popularize the true meaning of cooperation and attract the attention and understanding of the general public. Furthermore, while the propaganda of cooperation cannot be delayed, the promotion of facts is also an important plan. Therefore, the Bureau believes that the best way to arouse the special interest and deep understanding of the general public in cooperative societies is to create an experimental zone.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Guest Speeches <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, guest Wang Shiying gave a speech entitled "The Relationship Between the Cooperative Movement and Social People," stating briefly: Today, I am here to participate in the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week, and I will report to you on the meaning of cooperation that I have studied on weekdays. Our country has always paid little attention to the cooperative movement, and what our country needs most now is the promotion of cooperative enterprises. In today's world economic recession, cooperative enterprises are even more needed. In the past few years, the citizens of Shanghai have not had a sufficient understanding of this, so the National Government stipulated measures for the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week in 1929, precisely because it has great significance. The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs is in charge, enabling capable people in society to jointly promote cooperative enterprises, not only in Shanghai but also to ensure that there are cooperative organizations in the interior. Citizens who do not understand believe that cooperative enterprises are very ordinary. In fact, if cooperative enterprises are carried out effectively, all agricultural products, such as transportation, will be done by themselves, so that capitalist merchants will have no way to suppress them. This is a peaceful revolutionary movement. Modern capitalism oppresses merchants and farmers, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Cooperative societies are to transform consumption and modern economic organization, and after overthrowing the old capitalism, the new economic organization will consolidate its strength on the old foundation. If farmers can understand this principle, then capitalists will collapse without being pushed. The organization of cooperative societies is for oneself on the one hand, and to help others on the other hand. At the same time, it is hoped that there will be a share of capital, that is, to contribute a share of capital. This kind of organization enables moral knowledge to have a considerable understanding, to do well, and there is also a kind of pleasure in the spirit. The development of cooperative enterprises in the countryside is the center of social interaction, part of it is for entertainment, and the vitality is also booming. Part of it focuses on education, and the people's knowledge can also develop accordingly. In today's era of internal and external troubles and the decline of people's livelihood, the cooperative enterprise can no longer be ignored. The speeches of Xing Wan and Zou Bingwen are omitted.</p>

<p>Representatives included Li Suixian, Secretary of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Zhang Hanyun of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Xingjia of the Bureau of Health, Zhu Zhenxun of the Bureau of Education, Zhang Yichen of the Lih Jiao Hui [Likely a religious organization], Chen Peide of the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, and employees of the Bureau of Social Affairs Chen Lengseng, Zhang Zhenyuan, Wang Gang, and guests from all walks of life Wu Juenong, Shi Boyan, etc., more than 200 people in total, chaired by Li Suixian.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony and salutations, Chairman Li Suixian first reported that today is the International Cooperative Movement Anniversary, and the central government has stipulated measures for the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week, so that the general public can have a general understanding. Zhejiang has already held 19 sessions, and we in Shanghai only started to carry it out last year. Due to the January 28 Incident, it was delayed until today. Although cooperative enterprises have been advocated, many people still do not understand the true meaning, so they cannot achieve considerable results. From this, we can see that the mission we bear today in holding the lecture meeting is very important. At the same time, it can make those who do not understand the truth and engage in the cooperative movement know that the cooperative enterprise is not an easy thing. The Bureau now employs experts and is starting to organize a cooperative enterprise research association. I also propose to organize a consumer cooperative society, which can make the cooperation of industrial and commercial enterprises tend to develop day by day. Rural cooperative societies are also the most important urgent task now. With rural cooperative societies, we can improve the rural self-governance and rural economy, because the national economy is based on the countryside. I am very grateful to the experts and various groups for participating in the preparation of this lecture meeting. However, due to the hurried preparation, everything is very simple, please forgive me.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches Next, Zhang Hanyun, Zhang Yichen, and others gave speeches (lengthy speeches are not recorded). Then, Wu Juenong spoke on China's economic crisis and cooperative movements, briefly saying that due to economic panic and the dumping of foreign goods in recent years, imports exceed exports by about 500 million yuan every year in various industries, including agriculture, industry, and commerce. If cooperative enterprises are established, then the annual leak can be reduced or even cut off. Because China has never had such an organization, it is on the verge of economic bankruptcy. If we engage in cooperative enterprises, then production, consumption, sales, and distribution can also be improved, and the national economy can be restored, and the crisis can also be turned into safety. I hope that all sectors will work hard. Next, Shi Boyan spoke on the meaning of the cooperative movement, briefly stating that the difference between a cooperative enterprise and a Si Shang [likely means private/individual store] organization is that the cooperative society is not as financially strong as the company's capital. Because consumers and producers are directly connected, buying and selling from them is lower than the price of goods in stores, and the profits earned are given to the investors in part and to the shoppers in another part. At the same time, the amount of interest is determined according to the size of the customer's transaction. The power of the cooperative society is equal, and each person has the right to elect and be elected, which is not like a company whose power is determined by the number of shares. If a shareholder withdraws shares, the reason must be sufficient before they can withdraw, which is not like a company that can buy and sell at will. Next, Chen Peide and others gave speeches, which are also omitted. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The Society's Dinner Yesterday was the first day of the International Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week. Members of the China Cooperative Society and teachers and students of the Cooperative Research Class attached to the Society held a reunion dinner at Tongxinglou on Simalu at 7:00 p.m. A total of more than 40 members of the Society and students of the Research Class attended. At the beginning of the dinner, Wang Shiying, executive committee member of the Society, reported on the situation of the Society over the past five years and its current situation. Then, Wu Juenong, director of academic affairs of the Research Class, reported on the process of running the class. Li Quanshi, Wu Huanru of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and representatives of the Research Class students also gave speeches. Finally, there were recreational activities, which were very grand for a while.</p>

<p>The two Railway Administration Bureaus yesterday issued instructions to various departments, stating that in order to inform the relevant authorities that the Bureau Director and others have recently been inspecting the two railways, identifying areas that need to be developed or reformed, and instructing the responsible personnel to handle them, eliminating the drawbacks of closed-door policymaking and implementing measures based on specific needs. They have found that this approach yields faster and greater results. Furthermore, the contact opportunities between internal and external staff and superiors and subordinates have increased, making it easier to communicate feelings and eliminate misunderstandings. They plan to conduct a more organized inspection to achieve more comprehensive and far-reaching results. They have ordered the drafting of twelve articles of the Organizational Regulations for the Railway Administration Inspection Team, which were submitted and approved at the 13th Bureau Affairs Meeting on June 21, 1933, and will be implemented on July 1, 1933. According to Article 2 of the Regulations, Secretary Xiao Weiguo is appointed as the Director-General of the Inspection Team to facilitate operations. This order is hereby issued for strict compliance with the Organizational Regulations for the Railway Administration Inspection Team.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Special Party Department of the Security Office is Established, and Yang Hu and Others Were Sworn in Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Qun, Sent by the Central Government, Supervised the Oath and Delivered Instructions</p>
<p>Yang Hu, the head of the Shanghai Security Office, previously reported, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Military Party Department, that the Central Committee sent Zeng Zesheng, Jia Botao, Zou Yun, Wu Huan, etc., to be the preparatory committee members for the special party department of the office. The Central Organization Committee also sent Lu Jie to serve as the secretary-general. The committee members held their first meeting last week, distributing work and passing various important cases. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., the inauguration ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Security Office in Fengyao Bridge. More than 300 guests from all walks of life attended. Mr. Zhang Yuejun, specially sent by the Central Government, served as the oath supervisor. After each committee member took the oath, the oath supervisor Mr. Zhang Yuejun delivered instructions on behalf of the Central Government. Finally, Yang Hu delivered a reply on behalf of the preparatory committee. The ceremony ended and the attendees dispersed.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Instructions The oath supervisor Zhang Yuejun delivered instructions from the Central Government, briefly stating that today is the inauguration ceremony of the preparatory committee members of the Shanghai Security Office's special party department. The Central Government telegraphed me, brother, to attend the meeting to supervise the oath, which is a great honor. The security team is a kind of local army. The maintenance of local security, the completion of the tutelage work, and the implementation of construction work all require the assistance of the security team for promotion. The responsibility is very heavy. After the preparatory committee members take office today, I have a few points that you should pay attention to. The first is how to think about extracting ourselves and rescuing ourselves in this serious period of national crisis. The second is how to make the Shanghai citizens who have been ravaged by the enemy feel comforted in spirit and compensate for the material losses they have suffered. The third is to find a way to wash away the humiliation suffered. These three points, comrades, prove in history that only through continuous efforts and determining the direction and order of work can we achieve complete hope. The preparation of the Security Office's special party department has been very late. Committee Member Yang has made glorious contributions in Shanghai. I hope that in the future, you will work together with one heart and one mind, represent our party, lead the officers and soldiers under your command, and complete the revolution of the Three People's Principles, etc.</p>
<p>Yang Hu's Reply Then, preparatory committee member Yang Hu replied briefly, stating that this is the inauguration ceremony of the preparatory committee of the special party department of this office. I am very honored that the Central Committee sent Committee Member Zhang Yuejun to supervise the oath. Since the establishment of this office nearly a year ago, the Central Committee has considered that this office is responsible for protecting the security of Shanghai, and the responsibility is very heavy. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of this office and various teams should all have the party's organization and the party's training before they can assume the mission of the revolution. Therefore, Hu and five others were sent to serve as the preparatory committee members of the special party department. From now on, the officers and soldiers of this office should obey the orders of the party and sacrifice and fight for the party. We should sincerely accept the instructions given to us by the oath supervisor just now. We will uphold the intentions of the Central Committee, unite as one, and complete our mission, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Opposition to the New Tax System for the Tobacco and Liquor Industry <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Repeated Submissions to Departments and Appeals</p>
<p>Seeking Assistance from the Chamber of Commerce and the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Liquor Industry Association, along with the five industry associations of Liang Baijiu, Local Yellow Wine, Shaoxing Wine, Soy Sauce Wine, and Soy Sauce Gardens, are in opposition to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Affairs Administration's new fixed tax system, which abolished public sales and tax collection in the 22nd year, citing its harsh and cumbersome clauses and severe penalties. This has been previously reported. Yesterday, the association and others separately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Affairs Administration, and the Stamp Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau, appealing for revisions to the new regulations to ensure fairness. The original texts are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Tobacco Industry Submission The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association's submission to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Administration and the Stamp Tobacco Tax Bureau states: "To the Director of the Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and the Stamp Tobacco Tax Bureau: We, the association, according to the opinions presented by Yu Xunlu, a representative from member tobacco industry associations in Yixing, Nanjing, Wuxian, Wujin, Danyang, Wuxi, Liuhe, Liyang, Jintan, Gaoyou, Dongtai, and Tongshan, concerning Article 2 of the special tax regulations for domestic tobacco, which stipulates a tax of four yuan, one jiao, and five fen in national currency per 100 jin (approximately 50 kg), are uncertain of the standard used. If considering cured tobacco, which is sourced from foreign merchants procuring high-quality tobacco leaves for curing and is a raw material for manufacturing premium cigarettes, with prices ranging from at least three to ten yuan per jin in national currency, while the price of domestically produced tobacco leaves and strands in the production area is only around two yuan per 100 jin for the majority. The selling price of the finished domestic tobacco strands is at most three to four jiao per jin. Given the disparity in selling prices, the quality of tobacco leaves should be differentiated. This article taxes all at four yuan, one jiao, and five fen per 100 jin, which is unfair. The regulations for collecting fees on tobacco leaves based on estimated value and tiered rates seem fairer. In recent years, cigarette sales have been brisk, while domestic tobacco strands are ignored, and business is declining daily. If Article 2 of the special tax is not amended, not only will domestic tobacco merchants be unable to bear the heavy tax burden, but also farmers in the production areas will have no outlet for inferior tobacco, which will have a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. We request that your bureau forward this to the Ministry of Finance for review, to understand the situation, and to grade the estimated value into three levels, or set it as six yuan for Grade A, four yuan for Grade B, and two yuan for Grade C, and tax according to the grade, in order to ensure fairness and maintain the livelihoods of farmers and merchants." Upon review by our association, the opinions presented by the representatives accurately reflect the actual situation in various counties. Article 2 of the special tax regulations should be amended urgently. Furthermore, the representatives stated during their visit and petition that they were assured that the matter would be considered and handled accordingly. Therefore, we report this matter by telegram, hoping that you will review and revise it to maintain commerce and ensure fairness for the public good. The Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association jointly submits."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Liquor Industry Submission <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The five industry associations of Liang Baijiu, Local Yellow Wine, Shaoxing Wine, and Soy Sauce Gardens submit to the Tax Affairs Administration's Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau, stating: "Submitting this to report the dispatch of representatives to state the harshness of the new system and appeal for its abolition, hoping that you will review and adopt it to maintain commercial operations. We, the association, recently learned that the Tax Affairs Administration is abolishing public sales and tax collection in the 22nd year and establishing a new fixed tax system with harsh and detailed clauses and severe penalties. This not only increases the burden but also creates a dense web of laws, causing panic among liquor merchants. At the joint meeting of the association and others on the 29th of this month, it was unanimously agreed that the implementation of this new system would be tantamount to destroying commercial operations. If it is forcibly implemented, it will absolutely not be recognized, and we will insist to the end, sacrificing everything if necessary. It was resolved to each appoint two or one representative to jointly petition and appeal for its abolition. Zhu Shirong and Mei Weige from the Liang Baijiu industry, Fang Zhongheng and Jin Juqing from the Local Yellow Wine industry, Zhou Jinrong and Song Jinrong from the Shaoxing Wine industry, Han Xingwei from the Soy Sauce Wine industry, and Chen Weiwen and Song XingSui from the Soy Sauce Garden industry were publicly nominated as petition representatives, which was unanimously approved. We jointly submit this document, hoping that you will review it, adopt our humble opinions, abolish the new system to maintain commercial operations and avoid disputes, and we will be grateful. In addition to sending letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Liquor Industry Association for assistance, we respectfully submit this to Xie, the Director of the Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and Liang Luo, the Director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau."</p>

<p>The five industry associations and the joint association write to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "To the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: We are writing to inform you that we, the association, recently learned that the Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance is abolishing public sales and tax collection in the 22nd year and establishing a new fixed tax system with harsh and cumbersome clauses and severe penalties.

It was resolved to each appoint two or one representative to jointly petition and appeal for its abolition and to send letters to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Liquor Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance, which was unanimously approved. Previously, this case was raised as a temporary motion during the member conference convened by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submitted to your esteemed organization for review and transfer. In addition to sending separate letters, we send this special letter, hoping that your esteemed organization will uphold justice and provide assistance, and swiftly strive to abolish it based on the situation to maintain commercial operations. We will be grateful. Addressed to the Nanjing Tobacco and Liquor Industry Association, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Letter to the French Municipal Council <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A letter addressed to the Shanghai French Municipal Council states: "We are writing to inform you that, concerning the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Administration's changes to the tobacco tax rates in the 22nd year, abolishing public sales and tax collection and establishing a new fixed tax system with harsh clauses and severe penalties, merchants in the concessions, who have been bearing heavy business license fees and paying minimal public sales taxes, are now facing a sudden increase in large amounts due to the new system. This not only increases the burden but also creates a dense web of laws, causing panic among merchants. At the joint meeting of our association on January 29th, it was unanimously agreed that the implementation of this new system would be tantamount to destroying commercial operations. If it is forcibly implemented, it will absolutely not be recognized, and we will insist to the end, sacrificing everything if necessary. We fear that the administration will stubbornly act alone, ordering the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Inspection Office to dispatch personnel to request your Bureau to dispatch police to intimidate, which will inevitably incite incidents. Who will bear the responsibility? Our association is preventing disasters before they happen and stopping harm from approaching. We are sending this special letter, hoping that your Bureau will investigate and consider that our industry has always fulfilled its obligation to pay liquor license fees. Before this case is resolved, if the Inspection Office requests the dispatch of police, please temporarily suspend assistance to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and avoid disputes. We would appreciate a reply to reassure us. We are grateful. Addressed to the Shanghai French Municipal Council."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Yang Xingfo's Funeral Today <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica and the Science Society of China</p>
<p>Held Public Memorial Services Separately Yesterday Morning and Afternoon</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo, the former Director-General of the Academia Sinica, who was assassinated, has been temporarily laid to rest at the International Funeral Home. The funeral will be held today, with burial at the Yong'an Cemetery. Yesterday morning and afternoon, colleagues from the Academia Sinica and the Science Society of China held separate public memorial services.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica's public memorial service was held at 10:00 AM. Fu Sinian, Director of the Institute of History and Philology in Nanjing, Qian Tianhe, Director of the Natural History Museum, Gao Pingzi, Director of the Astronomical Institute, Xu Jifu, Secretary of the Academia Sinica, and Wang Yihou, Accountant, all came to Shanghai to participate, along with approximately two hundred staff members from the General Office and various institutes in Shanghai. Yang's family members were all present at the memorial hall to return the gestures of respect. The arrangement inside the hall was simple, with elegiac couplets presented by various circles hanging all over the walls, expressing deep sorrow. Flowers and wreaths were placed before the coffin, creating a very poignant scene. Cai Yuanpei, the President of the Academia Sinica, personally presided over the ceremony. The ceremony was very simple, consisting of bowing, reading the eulogy, and presenting the wreaths.</p>
<p>The Science Society of China's public memorial service was held at 3:00 PM, with all members of the society participating. Wang Liang, Director of the Institute of Northern Studies of the Academia Sinica, presided over the ceremony. Over thirty members of the society attended, including Peng Xuepei, Director of the Administrative Affairs Office of the Executive Yuan, Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, Cao Liangxia, President of Datong University, Hu Gangfu, a full-time researcher at the Physics Research Institute of the National Academia Sinica, and He Dekui, Secretary of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai French Concession. The text of the society's eulogy is recorded below: "Alas, Mr. Yang, afflicted with lung disease, medicine always at your side, constantly fearing a short life. We worried about you, your ambition strong but your body weak, your melancholy harming your years, perhaps like Jia Yan. In recent years, you became stronger, always prepared for action. You served in Nanjing and Shanghai, flying high. The demon of illness startled you, at banquets and gatherings. Who would have thought that you would die so strangely, not from disease, not from old age, not on the battlefield. A chaotic gunfire, a lone car unable to move. A bullet pierced your heart, leaving a trail of blood. A bright and wise man, gone in an instant. Alas, alas! You lived in academic institutions, not seeking political power. You were concerned about prisoners and helped those in danger. Who would have thought that such a benevolent man would suffer such a great wrong. One night in the car, you left no last words. The joy of your enemies, the sorrow of those who loved you. What did you do to deserve this? The sharpest weapons were your pen and tongue, but you did not hide them deeply. Every inch of your flesh feels the pain. The beloved sword will never be seen again, the orphaned children will be separated forever. Where does your spirit go? Our hearts burn with grief. Alas, alas! Connected to this society, starting in America, then moving to Jinling, your reputation grew. The foundation was built, the summer house was erected, becoming a forest of knowledge, all thanks to your plans. Running around, planning, your tongue scorched, your mouth parched, enduring hardships, never changing from beginning to end. Every year at the society gathering, you resolved disputes, made yourself heard, guiding with your torch, awakening with your morning bell. From Zhejiang to Guangdong, from Hebei to Shandong, you connected people from all over the country. We looked forward to opening up Sichuan and Chongqing. But now our leader has fallen, what shall we do? Alas, alas! In this world, who does not die? To live out one's life is what the world praises. When Mingfu drowned, you were heartbroken. When Zhimo died, your tears flowed. You grieved for the talented who were not allowed to live long. It was not just mourning a friend, but harming the nation. You saw Hu and Xu die even more tragically. On the open road, a trap was suddenly set, no time to defend, no chance to shout. Your office was nearby, but now it's shrouded in darkness. Our friendship with you was like that of brothers. Within five steps, there was no way to help you. The flames of the enemy burned high, the voices of your relatives and friends were swallowed. We build this tomb, offering wine and sacrifices, remembering your friendship, but unable to comfort your wronged soul. Alas, alas! May you enjoy this sacrifice."</p>
<p>After the public memorial service, the "Dotting the Spirit Tablet" ceremony was held, presided over by Cai Yuanpei. Yang's young son, Xiaofo, was in the hall, looking deeply saddened. He returned the gestures of respect to all those who came to pay their respects over the past few days. However, due to his wound not yet fully healed and his weak health, he will need to be hospitalized for treatment and recovery after the funeral. The funeral will be held today at 3:00 PM, with burial at the Yong'an Cemetery. Before the funeral, all the guests will offer their respects, followed by the family members. The route will be from Jing'an Temple Road to Haig Road to Hongqiao Road, and then to Yong'an Cemetery on Hopeland Road for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Navigation Industry Establishes Shipping Friends Bank <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Assisting in the Development of the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Regulating the Finances of Shipping Friends</p>
<p>With the increasing number of shipping companies in Shanghai and the increasing number of shipping friends, there has been a lack of financial regulation mechanisms. Although the Maritime Accident Insurance Company was established this spring, it was only intended for the consolation and relief of sailors in distress, and there was no proper solution to the general economic problems. Now, initiated by shipping industry figures such as Jia Dingxi, Ren Ziqing, Shi Zupei, Shen Zhongyi, and Cao Zijia, the Shipping Friends Bank has been established, which will greatly benefit shipping friends and the shipping industry. The details are explored below:</p>
<p>Founding Personnel Many of the initiators are central figures in the shipping industry, including shipowners on various rivers and seas such as Shi Zupei, Sun Meihong, Cui Songgu, Fu Dexing, Chen Zixian, Zheng Luzhai, Feng Changxu, Zhao Ruosi, Gao Chenghang, Wu Huisheng, Feng Yuming, Mao Rucai, Zou Xipei, Wu Xifeng, and Xin Lixiang, totaling twenty-three people. Sun Hengfu, the General Manager of the Ningbo Commercial Bank, and Shen Zhongyi and Cao Zijia are also initiators and founders.</p>
<p>Origin and Declaration Since the start of trade between China and foreign countries, nearly a century has passed, and transportation has gradually increased, with the shipping industry becoming increasingly developed. It is noted that in coastal provinces and along the Yangtze River ports, there are countless ships and tens of thousands of shipping friends. Their business income and expenditure amount to over ten million yuan annually. There has been a lack of specialized banks to regulate their financial affairs, which has greatly affected their economy and prevented the full development of their business. Colleagues have recognized this and have organized the Shipping Friends Bank to regulate the industry's finances and support its development. A savings department will be established to facilitate savings for shipping friends. All measures are aimed at promoting the welfare of the shipping industry, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit. The bank will adopt a prudent approach, avoid speculation, and ensure stable operations and complete financial transparency. Shareholders can elect representatives to inspect the accounts at any time for supervision. The authorized capital is 500,000 yuan. Once the shares are fully subscribed, a founding meeting will be held, and applications will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for approval and registration. The opening date will be announced in due course.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Contents The bank has been preparing for establishment by the founders, who have already subscribed to one-half of the shares. The proposed prospectus is as follows: (1) Name: Shipping Friends Bank. (2) Purpose: To promote savings among shipping friends and to protect the progress of the shipping industry. (3) Organizational Nature: To be organized in accordance with the new Banking Law promulgated by the National Government, handling commercial and savings operations. (4) Capital: Authorized capital of 500,000 yuan in national currency, divided into 10,000 shares at 50 yuan per share, to be paid in full at once. (5) Location: Shanghai. As business develops, branch offices will be established in other cities, or necessary agency offices will be established in other cities first. (6) Dividends: Weekly interest of eight percent, calculated from the date of payment of shares. (7) Shareholding: Those holding 30 or more shares will have the right to elect directors. (8) Plans: 1. Shipping friends can save money from one yuan upwards, with preferential interest rates. 2. Shipping friends can borrow small amounts from the bank, with detailed regulations to be formulated separately. For example, each ship friend can have the shipowner and chief mate endorse the loan and can also borrow advance wages from the bank. 3. Money saved in one bank can be withdrawn at the agent office of the bank in various places if needed, and the remittance fee can be waived for convenience. 4. When the bank has a surplus, it will allocate a certain amount to carry out shipping friends' public welfare activities. 5. Once the shares are fully subscribed, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to discuss the articles of association, submit them for registration, and then exchange the shares. 6. The share money will be collected by the Ningbo Commercial Bank and can only be used after the bank establishment procedures are completed. Before the procedures are completed, it cannot be used. 7. The initiators will first nominate a preparation director to set up a preparation office to carry out the work. The expenses will be minimized and advanced by the preparation director, and the expenses will be audited by the shareholders' meeting after the bank is formally established.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Tax on Imported Foreign Rice and Flour <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>To Save China's Declining Rural Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting a tax on imported foreign rice, foreign wheat, and foreign flour to save China's declining rural areas. The original petition states: "Submitting this petition. On June 25th, our association convened the fourth member representative assembly, where the Rice Milling Industry Association and the Rice Trading Industry Association proposed that domestic agricultural economies have been bankrupted due to continuous natural and man-made disasters in recent years. Last year, due to the massive import of foreign rice, while the price of all other goods rose, the price of rice alone was depressed to an extreme level, causing the livelihood of farmers, who make up 83% of the national population, to be on the verge of extinction. Taking this city as a densely populated area as an example, the consumption of food is huge, but rice merchants are suffering, and almost all of them cannot maintain their precarious existence. The situation of domestic agriculture and commerce is like this. Our country is founded on agriculture, and the prosperity or decline of the country depends on the stability of farmers' lives. It is not possible to ignore the fact that the consumers in the big cities, who account for a small percentage of the national population, benefit from cheap food. Although there may be a need for foreign rice to adjust supply and demand, the reorganization of the rural economy and the survival of farmers should be considered in both domestic and foreign contexts, so that they will not be bankrupted or endangered. In this severe period of agricultural and commercial decline, and for the sake of supply and demand, it is proposed to petition the Ministry of Industry to consult with the Ministry of Finance to impose countervailing duties on imported foreign rice, which will benefit the national treasury and assist farmers and merchants. Even if supply and demand reach a certain level, it may be possible to modify the measures at any time. In modern times, all countries implement tax protection policies for domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce in order to ensure domestic stability and external development. Today, the situation in our country requires the implementation of protection policies to save ourselves from danger. Therefore, we have described the difficult situation of agriculture and commerce in detail, hoping that you will make a decision as soon as possible." It was decided to petition your ministry to promptly handle the matter. It has been found that foreign rice, foreign wheat, and wheat flour from various countries are being dumped in our country due to overproduction, which harms the livelihood of farmers, causing the decline of rural production. Even the most prosperous provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are not immune to this situation. The reports from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways show a sharp decline in the transportation of agricultural products, which is alarming. In April of this year, our association intended to request the Grain Industry Association to separately levy import duties, and we petitioned your ministry, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for review. Now, we are continuing to request its prompt implementation, which shows that the matter is urgent and cannot be ignored. We respectfully petition your ministry to review and handle the matter promptly for the public good."</p>

<p>Rice merchants in this city have reported that some boatmen transporting rice are adulterating the rice with water in an attempt to increase the volume, causing significant losses to the rice merchants. Therefore, they petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs to formulate measures to crack down on this practice. It is now learned that the measures have been drafted by the Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. The original text is copied below: (Shanghai Municipal Measures for Cracking Down on Water Adulteration in Rice) Article 1: These measures shall be used to crack down on any boatmen who transport rice to the city and adulterate the rice with water in an attempt to increase the volume. Article 2: When a rice store or shop discovers that the rice transported by a boatman is suspected of being adulterated with water, it shall immediately report the boatman's name to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, which shall submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs to dispatch personnel to supervise the inspection. Article 3: The Bean and Rice Industry Association shall designate representatives to be supervised by the Bureau of Social Affairs to identify whether the rice has been adulterated with water. The number of representatives from the Bean and Rice Industry Association shall be determined by the association. Article 4: If it is confirmed after identification that the boatman has adulterated the rice with water, the boatman shall be fined twenty yuan. The same shall apply to repeat offenders. If the boatman does not repent and commits the offense for the third time, in addition to being fined twenty yuan, the local Bean and Rice Industry Association shall notify the inland colleagues that the boatman shall never be allowed to transport rice again. Article 5: The Bureau of Social Affairs shall review and decide on the penalty stipulated in the preceding article. However, to avoid difficulties in enforcement, the boat shall be detained before the fine is paid, or the Public Security Bureau shall be requested to instruct the district office to detain it. Article 6: These measures shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Zhao Tieqiao's Assassin Arrested <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>丨The main culprit, Zhou Zhizhang, was arrested in the Xian Shi Amusement Park丨</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was riding in a car on the morning of April 29, 1920, at 9:00 AM, from his residence to the company to handle business. When he arrived at the front of the company, several thugs suddenly rushed out from the side and fired several shots at Zhao, all hitting vital points. He was rushed to the hospital, but due to the fatal nature of the injuries, he could not be saved and died. The assassins escaped from the scene. Although the authorities offered a reward for their arrest, the thugs fled to distant places and remained at large, making it impossible to capture them. Until the other day, Hua Zong Tan Chang You Agen of the Old Gate Patrol discovered that the main culprit in the case, Zhou Zhizhang (also known as Xuan Si) from Anhui, was playing in the amusement park of the Xian Shi Company. He immediately cooperated with Detectives Liu Junqing, Zhou Guisen, and Detective Li Shugui, and secretly went to the park. They arrested Zhou and his accomplices Xun Gewenqing, Gong Wenjiang, and two women, Jin Zhang and Zhou Xu, and took them to the patrol room. After investigating, it was found that the two women, Jin Zhang and Zhou Xu, were not related to the case and were released. Yesterday morning, Zhou and the others were escorted to the First Special District District Court Criminal Court No. 1, where Judge Qian Hongye questioned them. Attorney Qian Xunjiu of the Patrol Room stated that it had been found that the defendant Zhou Zhizhang was indeed the main culprit in the Zhao Tieqiao assassination case. The two defendants, Ge and Gong, had also committed many theft cases. The Patrol Room is currently investigating the case and should be allowed to detain them. After questioning each of the defendants, Judge Qian ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">China Bank Robbery Case: Kitchen Staff Inside Job with Robbers <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Total of Nine Male and Female Robbery Suspects Apprehended</p>
<p>Only Recovered $100 of the Stolen Money</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the China Bank, Nanshi Branch, Xiaodongmen, where $11,000 was stolen on the afternoon of the 28th of last month, Lu Ying, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad, dispatched Detective Foreman Gu Liancheng to investigate. Gu Liancheng discovered that the robbers were hiding at No. 2, Nanyang Inn, 337 Mintini Road, French Concession. He then dispatched officers to cooperate with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police to apprehend nine robbers and suspects. The details of the arrest were reported in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>It is now reported that during interrogation yesterday, Lu Ying received a confession from Wu Quantai, a Ningbo native, 33 years old. He stated that he had been released from a foreign prison last year. Together with Chen Yincai, Mao Yunxing, Zhou Heshang, and others, they had no means of livelihood. Zhou came up with the idea of robbery. Zhou et al. met Mao Yunxing at the First Floor Teahouse in Ji畝地, and then called out Ma Pi, the cook from the China Bank branch. They pointed out the old escort and two guards who were escorting the money. After the robbery, Zhou brought back the money and gave me $100, and so on.</p>
<p>Mao Yunxing, 30 years old, a Ningbo native, living in the attic of the Nanyang Inn in the French Concession, confessed that he, Chen Yincai, and Wu Quantai planned the robbery at Zhou Heshang's house. Together with an unknown worker, they took two pistols to commit the robbery. I received $80, which I have already spent.</p>
<p>Zhou Heshang, 35 years old, from Wujiang, residing at No. 152 Dajing Road, Ji畝地, front building, a tailor, stated: I used to work at Zhang Fulang's house at No. 3, Hua Fang, Fangbang Bridge. I met Wu Quantai and Mao Yunxing there. Through them, I also met Zhu Xiaoliu (i.e., Ma Pi). He cooks at Changhe Pig Shop. Zhu often discussed the plan with me at my house. He brought six people to commit the robbery. My accomplices gave me over $600, another $10,000 to Wu Quantai, $50 to Mao Yunxing, and used tens of dollars. A total of $270 remained. As for the money I got, I sent it in a box to Zhou Mumu, a fellow villager working as a maid at No. 544, Xinyu Lane, Meibai 格 Road.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoliu (Ma Pi), 36 years old, from Wujiang, living in the Changhe Pig Shop on Lishipu 裏 Street, confessed: I worked as a substitute cook at the China Bank. A fellow villager, Hongsheng, mentioned to me that he was in trouble and asked if there was any opium to rob. I replied that it was possible to rob money. Our bank handles thousands of dollars every day. Would it be good for you to rob our bank? At that time, I was just joking. I did not expect that Hongsheng would later want to rob my bank's money, which I prevented. Hongsheng then told Zhou Heshang about this matter. Two months later, Zhou Heshang called Hongsheng to ask me to discuss it at his house. He committed the robbery and gave me $115. I was really fooled and ask for leniency.</p>
<p>The other five people, Chen Yongde, Liu Jiasheng, Zhou Wu氏, Zhao Shunfa, and Shen Jinrong, are only suspected and there is no concrete evidence. Their confessions are omitted. After verifying the confessions, the squad dispatched officers yesterday morning to cooperate with detectives from the Public Concession Police, and rushed to the box of Zhou Mumu, a maid at No. 544, Xinyu Lane, Meibai 格 Road, to recover the original stolen $100. The team took them for record. It is reported that the squad has detained all the suspects and will continue to investigate the remaining accomplices and handle the case together.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Murdered Female Corpse Discovered in China Public School, Wusong <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Resembling a Female Student</p>
<p>Barefoot Wearing Running Shoes</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the buildings of China Public School in Paotai Bay, Wusong, have been severely damaged. Therefore, the school has not yet been restored. No one lives inside. Although there are one or two watchmen, they all live outside the school gate. As a result, few people go inside. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a female corpse resembling a female student was suddenly discovered on the road in the main hall of the school. After Pu Yousheng, the local bailiff, received the news and went to inspect it, he saw that the female corpse was about 20 years old, wearing a light red cheongsam and long gown, barefoot with running shoes. There were injuries to her head, with bloodstains everywhere. She was lying on her back on the ground, with many old newspapers padded underneath her body. There were also many foods such as bananas next to the corpse. Since no family members could be found and no one recognized her, the bailiff reported it to the 7th District Police Bureau and hired workers to guard the site, and will go to Shanghai this morning to report to the local court to send someone to Wusong for an examination. However, based on the condition of the female corpse, it seems that she was murdered. Whether this is the case can only be confirmed after the examination.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Autopsy of Maya Female Worker <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>| Cause of Death: Severe Malaria |</p>
<p>Han Shengxiang, a 15-year-old female worker from Shaoxing at the Maya No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, became seriously ill on the 27th of last month. The factory sent her to Baolong Hospital in the British Concession for treatment, but she died shortly after. The hospital doctors found injuries to the lower part of the woman's body, so they reported it to the Xinzha Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. They then moved the body to the Feilun Road Mortuary and took Ye She氏, the female tea room worker in the factory, female workers Wang Hefen, Qiu Genfen, and Qiu Guifen and Xue Meihua, friends of the deceased, to the police station. Later, because the case occurred within the jurisdiction of the 4th District Public Security Bureau, the bureau sent officers to take Ye She氏 and the other four into custody. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving the report, the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei and others to go to the mortuary for an examination. To clarify the truth, they ordered an autopsy. Yesterday, forensic officers Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan from the First Special Court performed the autopsy and learned that the woman had indeed died of malaria and other diseases. Prosecutor Guo then interrogated Gao Shiheng, the deputy manager of the factory, and Fang Shaofu, a detective from the 4th District Public Security Bureau, and then ruled that the deceased woman, Han Shengxiang, had indeed died of severe malaria. The body was handed over to the factory manager, Wang Shirong, to claim it for coffining and burial. It was also heard that the woman's hymen had indeed been ruptured between two and three months ago.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Loaded Dice Guarantee Gamblers Lose Every Time <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Jin Shude Compensates Due to Guilt</p>
<p>Reports Theft Afterward</p>
<p>Jin Shude, nicknamed Xiaofang, a native of Ningbo, is an unemployed vagrant. Recently, he secretly opened a gambling den at No. 17, Xinjia Garden, Xinzha Road, taking a cut of the profits. Dong Xinhai, a native of this county, was one of the gamblers in the den. From the 12th to the 15th of last month, Dong lost hundreds of dollars every day. Dong later found out that the dice in the gambling den were loaded, allowing the house to control the outcome at will, so gamblers could not win. He was very unhappy and negotiated with Jin without success. On the morning of the 16th, Dong led many people with pistols to Jin's place to demand a return of $500. After repeated negotiations, Jin returned $250 to Dong to settle the matter. Afterward, Jin suddenly went to the police station and falsely reported being robbed, claiming that one of the robbers was recognized as Dong Xinhai. The police, unaware of the deception, recently had Hua Detective Liu Junqing and Zhou Guisen from the Old Zha Police Station arrest Dong on Yunnan Road and send him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Qian Hong, the head of the criminal court of the First Special Court, continued the trial in the first criminal court. Dong Xinhai confessed the whole story. The court immediately summoned the doorman of Xinjia Garden, No. 1108, to the court. According to the arrest warrant, "On the morning of the 16th of last month, I heard a lot of noise inside No. 17, which sounded like a dispute. I knocked on the door to inquire. Jin Shude said that he was hosting a banquet and there was nothing else. So I withdrew. Later, I heard the sound of dice being thrown again and went to inquire again. Jin replied that he was taking a concubine to play with, so I withdrew again. Not long after, I suddenly heard someone knocking on the alley door. I went to open the door and saw Dong Xinhai and four or five people enter. Dong and the others were all armed with pistols. Two of them held guns to watch me and dragged me upstairs into No. 17. I immediately heard Dong say, 'Call Xiaobaozi out to talk.' At that time, Jin Shude immediately stepped forward and said that they were all family members and that everyone should talk things out. Dong demanded $500, and Jin gave him $250 before they left. At that time, I immediately wanted to report to the police station, but Jin asked me to wait a moment and he would go to the French Concession one afternoon and then go. So I waited for Jin and then went out. Jin returned home and reported to the police station with me. After Dong was arrested, Jin and his wife, as well as two other hooligans, all told me not to recognize Dong Xinhai, but I refused." Judge Qian said that according to the doorman's testimony, Jin Shude was suspected of running a gambling den. Why did the police not prosecute him? The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, immediately stated, "When the doorman reported to the police station, the plaintiff did tell him not to recognize him. At that time, the police station planned to sue Jin, but Jin himself recognized Dong Xinhai, so he was not prosecuted. Now that the court believes that he should be prosecuted, please detain Jin Shude and let the police station investigate and prosecute him." Judge Qian then ordered Jin Shude to be detained and rescheduled the trial for July 8.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Hairdressing Industry Zhaoxue High Case Committee, regarding the case of hairdresser Gao Yatou being kicked in the kidneys by Western Police Officer Milly Hong of No. 39 Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, resulting in immediate death, sent a special letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng yesterday: "Dear Chairman Du Yuesheng, with utmost respect, our association, on behalf of our colleagues, for the case of our colleague Gao Yatou being kicked to death by Western Police Officer Milly Hong of No. 39 Shan Zhong Road in the French Concession due to an unsuccessful investigation, elected representatives Luo Shantao and others last Sunday to accompany the deceased's father, Gao Yuanlin, to your association to petition for assistance in the High Case negotiation, and the deceased's father pleaded for relief, etc. At that time, you and the committee members generously agreed, accepted the petition, and agreed to negotiate with the French authorities for mediation. The representatives returned to the association and reported the situation. Our colleagues were all satisfied and deeply admired. We have always admired your kindness. Once you take office for mediation, you will surely achieve satisfactory results. However, according to the 12th executive committee meeting convened by our association the day before yesterday, it was said that the High Case has occurred for more than a month, but there is still no solution. The deceased's father, Gao Yuanlin, has been staying in Shanghai for a long time, grieving and calling out, and life is difficult. We sincerely hope that this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that he can return to his hometown to farm and maintain the livelihood of his family.

We will be eternally grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Public Security Bureau Orders Suspension of Digging Liu Tomb <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Ming Dynasty ancestral tomb belonging to the Liu family in Gong Huiji Woodworking Shop, No. 100 Wanzhu Street, Ji畝地, was recently planned to be rebuilt. The Liu family supervised the excavation and relocation of the bones. Because the tomb building was solid and not easy to destroy, except for the main mausoleum, the other side tombs have been almost completely destroyed. This matter was learned by Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because the tomb had been disputed by Liu's descendants in the third year of the Republic of China, he specifically ordered Liu Shixi, the tomb owner, to the Public Security Bureau to inquire about everything and ordered him to submit a written statement, and ordered the excavation to be suspended. Yesterday, it was heard that the municipal government has also informed the Public Security Bureau to order the tomb owner Liu to stop the excavation pending thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The Commercial Press, in view of the fact that in recent years, students who enroll in school often have difficulty continuing their studies due to economic difficulties, which is detrimental to both individuals and society, and that new graduates from schools lack practical experience and still need a long period of training to be competent, now aims to assist students who are currently studying in high school, have poor family backgrounds, and have excellent grades. To give them a chance to gain practical experience, we are now recruiting more than a dozen work-study students, allowing them to engage in commercial practice in the library during holidays and spare time, and paying them a remuneration of 80 yuan per year to subsidize their tuition fees. It is heard that the library has already conducted one examination. The successful candidates will be assigned to practice immediately. There are still a few vacancies. Students who are currently studying in public and private high schools in this city, are between 16 and 18 years old, are physically strong, and can provide a reliable guarantee, can immediately submit detailed academic qualifications, together with the most recent academic transcript, and ask the school where they are located to send a letter to the personnel department of the library to register for the examination.</p>

<p>Police Chief Jiang De and Yang Chengshan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Brigade, along with many police officers, patrolled to Datong Pier at around 11:00 AM yesterday. They saw the Zhengda steamboat moored there, ready to set sail. They immediately boarded the ship to check and spotted two men and two women in the steerage compartment whose behavior was suspicious. They questioned them, but the four gave inconsistent answers. They were immediately taken to the team. Captain Zhu questioned them. One of the men confessed his name as Huang Yaogen, 20 years old, and the other as Gu Chengzhang, 24 years old, both from Tongzhou. They used to be workers at the Yidaijiao Yarn Factory and were very close. There were also female workers Lei Yinfeng and Shi Sandi from the same factory. The two had a very good relationship with Huang and Gu on weekdays. In the autumn, Huang and Gu were laid off by the factory, but they then went to work at the Hongxiang Electrical Materials Company on Xiaoshadu Road. However, Lei and Shi were still very close. By the winter, Huang and Gu had been laid off again, and the two rented a house near Gordon Road. At that time, the two women still followed closely. Therefore, Huang and Yinfeng, and Gu and Sandi, had physical relationships. To cleverly avoid the attention of outsiders, the two women eloped with Huang and Gu at this time. They temporarily hid in Fangbang Bridge, Nanshi, and planned to return to Tongzhou, their original home, on the Zhengda Steamboat today (yesterday). When questioned, the two women, Lei, 20 years old, and Shi, 17 years old, both from Changzhou, said that eloping with Huang and Gu was their own decision. According to the confession, Captain Zhu referred the case to the Judicial Section of the Municipal Government for handling as it involved abduction.</p>

<p>| Three Robbers Climbed Over the Wall to Enter |</p>
<p>At 2:00 AM yesterday, when Qiu Guoyuan's family at No. 9 Yixing Lane, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, was sound asleep, three robbers suddenly came. They were wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, and one of them had a pistol. The robbers saw that the front and back doors of the house were tightly closed and they could not enter, so they found a way to climb over the wall and went straight upstairs. When the owner woke up in a dream, the robbers had already entered the room and were intimidating them into silence. The owner had no choice but to let the robbers rummage through the boxes and cabinets and search at will. After about an hour, they looted the downstairs and fled through the back door of the house. After the incident, the owner checked the lost items and found that they had been robbed of four silver chains, one gold ring, several pieces of clothing, and more than 30 yuan in cash. He immediately reported it to the Third Year of the Fifth District under the jurisdiction, requesting investigation and arrest. Director Wen has ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate and arrest.</p>

<p>Youth Causes Accident While Driving</p>
<p>Many People Injured</p>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, a certain youth was driving a private car with a black license plate number 8418 and passed the intersection of Chongqing Road and Dagu Road. Unexpectedly, the youth was not skilled in driving, causing the car to swerve from side to side on the road. At the same time, there were many pedestrians on the road. The youth panicked and accidentally drove the car onto the sidewalk. Before he could stop, he hit four pedestrians on the sidewalk. Seeing that he had caused an accident, the youth abandoned the car and fled. When the police at post No. 2239 nearby heard the alarm and arrived, the person had already left and the car was empty. They quickly sent the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. Chen Xiaoheng, a native of Sichuan, 22 years old, had a broken back and is still hospitalized. Zhu Zigan, 25 years old, injured both hands and feet. Wen Yushui, 23 years old, suffered abrasions to the chest. Chen Fuzi, 28 years old, injured his head.

Yesterday, Gao lost a pair of pants and suspected that Xiao Liuzi had stolen them, so he went to question him. However, not long after, the pants were suddenly found. At 11:30 PM, Kan Guangmao, because his younger brother Xiao Liuzi had suffered an injustice, turned to Gao Libin. At that time, colleagues Ying Shaohua and others were also on the side deeply blaming Gao's inappropriateness and questioning him slightly. Unexpectedly, Gao was violent by nature. At this point, he grabbed two hairdressing scissors and stabbed Kan's chest once and his left hand once, and also injured Ying Shaohua's left eye, causing him to bleed profusely. The colleagues quickly sent the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment and turned the assailant over to the police for handling by the court in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Hongwan Society President Xiong Xiling Telegraphs for Relief Funds from the Shanghai Joint Relief Association to Provide Urgent Relief <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The World Hongwan Society previously believed that the disaster situation in the war-stricken areas was dire. Special relief workers were sent to the Pingbei and Jidong areas to investigate the situation of refugees and provide urgent relief in advance. The relief commissioners have already set off to investigate and provide relief. However, the funds raised by the society were not enough to provide relief. Yesterday, the Shanghai Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Xiong Xiling, requesting assistance with relief funds to benefit the disaster victims. The original telegram is transcribed as follows: "Mr. Huang Hanzhi of the Shanghai Relief Association for Northeastern China, and all gentlemen from all walks of life, I bow. I previously agreed to raise one million yuan, with Pingjin and Shanghai each raising one-third, and promoted Bei Shang to contact the Pingjin authorities. Yesterday, the 25th, I went to consult with Chairman Huang, who said that the government has allocated one million yuan from the Ministry of Finance for relief in North China. Mr. Zhou Zuomin also suggested that the extension of the Hebei farmland water conservancy and saline salt surtax be extended for four years, which could collect approximately five million yuan. This amount would be mortgaged to the bank for four million yuan, for a total of five million yuan, which would be sufficient for large-scale relief. The government has also approved the plan. The saline salt surtax case is the one I referred to in my fundraising letter. Now that the government has decided on a large amount of relief, the previous agreement on the Pingjin-Shanghai division can be abandoned. However, our society has sent a relief team to the counties and villages in the war-stricken areas that have not yet been received to investigate the refugee population and plan to provide urgent relief once. However, the funds raised by our society are only tens of thousands of yuan, which is far from enough. Please remit all the donation funds from your association to our society for joint distribution. The merits are immeasurable. Xiong Xiling, President of the Chinese General Association of the World Red Swastika Society, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>| Taking the Shaanxi-Gansu route to Qinghai; returning via Ningxia and Baotou to Beiping |</p>
<p>The China Borderland Culture Promotion Association, which first organized the Qinghai Expedition last month, has completed preparations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Route into Qinghai) After careful investigation, the expedition's route to Qinghai will be by train from Shanghai to Nanjing, then via the Jinpu Railway to Xuzhou. From there, it will turn west via the Haizhou route to Tongguan. After entering the pass, it will take a bus to Xi'an in Shaanxi, then via Xianyang, Binzhou, and Pingliang to Lanzhou. From Lanzhou, it will travel west to Xining in Qinghai, or other locations. If time permits on the return journey, it will travel northeast from Lanzhou via Ningxia and the Hetao region to Baotou, then via the PingSui Railway to Zhangjiakou, turning south to Beiping, and returning to Shanghai by train.</p>
<p>(Departure Tomorrow) The five members of the expedition are scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, expecting to return to Shanghai in early September, with a duration of approximately two months.</p>
<p>(Scope of Investigation) The purpose of this expedition to Qinghai is simply to find suitable locations in the province to prepare for the establishment of several public schools for the Han, Hui, Mongolian, and Tibetan peoples. Therefore, the scope is very simple. However, the Yibu Zhongshan Cultural Education Center has entrusted the expedition to investigate education, agriculture, rural areas, land, economy, nomadic life, industry, customs, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>(List of Members) The members of the Qinghai Expedition have been determined by the association at its fourth executive committee meeting: executive committee members Gu Zhizhong and Lu Yi (both reporters for the Xinwen Bao newspaper), executive committee member Gu Yongzhong, alternate supervisory committee member Shu Yongkang (from the education sector), and member Huang Bokui (General Secretary of the China Mining Society). However, Gu Yongzhong is unable to leave Shanghai due to other commitments. At the same time, Wang Yang, a professor at Tongde Medical College, requested to join the association. This was approved at the meeting, and he will travel to the destination for investigation.</p>
<p>(Funding) At 5:00 PM yesterday, the association held its fifth executive committee meeting. Committee members Yu Tianxi, Zhang Xianmei, Gu Zhizhong, Lu Yi, and Gu Yongzhong were present. First, Gu Zhizhong reported on the funding for the Qinghai Expedition: Zhongshan Cultural Education Center provided 1,000 yuan, Xinwen Bao newspaper provided 400 yuan, Hua An Company provided 200 yuan, Mr. Wu Zhiping provided 200 yuan, and Mr. Zeng Zhongming provided 100 yuan, totaling 1,900 yuan, still short by approximately 400-500 yuan. Next, the expedition route and departure date were decided.</p>
<p>(Broadcast Today) Finally, Lu Yi proposed that frontier work urgently requires greater attention from the Chinese people. It was resolved that before the expedition departs, a broadcast will be made to all sectors of society. It was decided that Ms. Ouyang Kaili, a member of the association, will broadcast from the Ma Lishi New Village San Rui Tang Liji Broadcasting Station today from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Special Feature: Discussion on the Modernization of China <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao Monthly" will publish a special anniversary oversized issue on July 15th, adding a special feature on "The Modernization of China," while the original columns will also be published as usual. The advance notice of its main contents has already been disclosed in the advertising column of this newspaper. Now, the reasons for the publication's discussion of China's production modernization problems are recorded below to promote the attention of the Chinese people to production issues.</p>
<p>What are the gains and losses of fighting airplanes and tanks with broadswords? What is the speed of rickshaws and sailing boats competing with automobiles and steamships? What is the difference in production volume between spinning and weaving with hand-cranked spinning wheels and new-style textile machines, and between plowing with old-fashioned rakes and new-style tractors? Although these are questions that even three-foot-tall children can answer without thinking, we must pay attention to the fact that airplanes, steamships, textile machines, tractors, and so on are all tools created in the industrial revolution over the past one or two hundred years. At the same time, their influence has also changed the old economic, social, and political organizations. Now, the production tools and methods of industrially advanced countries have long been "modernized," and their social organizations are also very different from the situation in the era of pure agriculture and handicrafts. Although their current social organizations have many shortcomings, their "modernization" of production is a great achievement of progress that no one can deny. The situation in industrially advanced countries is like this. Looking back at the current situation in our China, what is it like?</p>
<p>In our China, the standard of living has fallen to the point where most people are lingering in a state of semi-starvation; the strength of external defense is so weak that four provinces have been lost, and there is no way to deal with it! The root cause of this is not that other countries have already "modernized," while many places in China are still stuck in the old ways and have failed to adapt to the modern environment? Therefore, recently, almost every Chinese person has felt the necessity of China's "modernization," and "China's modernization" has become a general call.</p>
<p>Indeed, China's only way out economically in the future is "modernization," but when it comes to China's modernization, there are important issues that need to be discussed. The questions are:</p>
<p>(1) What are the difficulties and obstacles to China's "modernization"? What are the prerequisites for promoting China's "modernization"?</p>
<p>(2) Should China's "modernization" adopt individualism or socialism? "Modernization" promoted by foreign capital or "modernization" initiated by national capital? And what are the steps to realize this method?</p>
<p>We believe that the future of China depends on the answers to these two questions, so we specially solicit the opinions of some experts in the country for an open discussion.</p>
<p>In today's time of national crisis, discussing these two issues may seem too "leisurely." In fact, "How to save China from danger and extinction?" and "Where is China going?" are long-standing questions in everyone's mind. We want to raise these questions and solicit different opinions from various parties. The purpose is to contribute various materials related to answering these questions to the Chinese people. It is not to be high-minded or to escape reality. Now, in order to make everyone understand the meaning of raising these questions, it may be useful to simply state a few more sentences. China's rural areas are currently showing signs of collapse, while industry and commerce are declining, and the import surplus statistics reached a record of more than 550 million taels last year. The danger of the entire national economy going bankrupt is imminent. Why is it still impossible to save it for a while? In other words, what is the root cause of why China's industry has not yet been "modernized"? Because this is an urgent problem that China needs to solve, we want to raise the first question and solicit the opinions of various parties. Secondly, in the past two centuries, various countries have successively experienced industrial revolutions and gone through the process of "modernization," resulting in modern capitalist social organizations. This kind of organization is currently showing many flaws due to the unprecedented global economic panic, and it is shaking. Should China's future "modernization" simply follow their old path, or should it seek a new path? "It is easy to start, but difficult to finish." Since we have raised the first question, the second question must naturally be raised for discussion at the same time.</p>
<p>Since the publication of this journal, it has been one year. We are very grateful for the welcome and love of our readers, which has enabled us to develop day by day. Now we have decided to compile the opinions of various parties on the above two questions in the July issue of this journal and present them to our readers to fulfill our obligations and commemorate the first anniversary of the publication.</p>

<p>Recognize Responsibilities in a Grave Environment</p>
<p>Urge Leaders to Jointly Overcome National Crisis After Returning Home</p>
<p>Encourage Students with De Fichte's Words</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Students' Joint Association held its twelfth executive committee meeting at the headquarters of the Youth Propaganda Corps yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. Attendees included representatives from Chiao Tung University, Chinan University, Great China University, Soochow University, and Wen Hua University. Kung Shao-hsiung of Chiao Tung University presided. The meeting resolved to (1) issue a letter to students returning home for summer vacation, (2) have all executive committee members participate in the welcoming ceremony for General Ma Chan-shan, (3) send a telegram to Chairman Ho of the Hunan Provincial Government requesting protection and assistance when the association's summer national salvation propaganda team arrives, and (4) contact the radio station to broadcast national salvation propaganda. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m. The text of the letter to students traveling home for summer vacation is recorded below. In the blink of an eye, the summer vacation has arrived. Students are about to embark on their journey home. The toil of studying for half a year, however, this year's summer vacation is different from previous years. Do not lightly take a step into your home. Before entering your home, take a look around the environment and, even more importantly, clearly understand the responsibilities you should bear in this grave environment. What is the gravity of the current environment? Rampaging Japanese invaders, leaping bandits, internal worries and external troubles, all pressing down. Resisting tyranny and striving for survival, even with the strength of our entire nation, it is difficult to hope for relief. And the leaders within the country are not conscious of this situation, often destroying their own lines of defense. The severity of the environment and the precariousness of the national situation are unprecedented. We young university students hold the future of the country and are the lifeline of the nation. How can we revitalize our country? How can we revive our nation? How can we escape annihilation and achieve survival? The key lies in the hands of us university students. Having recognized the gravity of the current environment, which stems from internal and external troubles, the failure of the country's leaders to unite sincerely and endure for the sake of the country is the greatest reason for the critical national situation. During this trip home, students should lead the people in their localities, urging the country's leaders to go to the capital immediately to jointly overcome the national crisis. The country today cannot defend itself without unity, and it cannot be saved without unification. In addition to this, the students' responsibility during the summer vacation is to continue sharpening their knowledge. Sporadic efforts yield no results. National salvation lies in effective struggle. Studying can cultivate strength and build the foundation for struggle. Acquiring true knowledge will allow you to contribute to society and the country in the future and bear the great responsibility of revitalizing the country and reviving the nation. The famous German philosopher Fichte said in a speech to the German people, "Today, what I expect from those who listen to this lecture is not to be content with the status quo, not to lament the failures of the past and be unable to overcome their grief, not to seek solace after the pain, not to fall into self-abandonment because there is no comfort, not to drift along and get by. What I want from you is that you can extricate yourselves from suffering and engage in clear thought and contemplation. What I want to take you out of the abyss of suffering is not to tell you that external assistance will come, and that there will be changes over time. What I want to tell you is to understand our position, to understand the strength we have left, and to understand the methods for saving ourselves." I dare to offer Fichte's words to my fellow students who are about to leave for their summer vacation as a mirror.</p>

<p>Waseda to Play MacLeans Again Today</p>
<p>The Waseda University team, champions of the Tokyo Big Six Baseball League, was previously defeated by MacLeans 5-1. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., the team competed against the American Amateur team at the China Baseball Field. The Amateur team defeated Waseda 8-6. In the first three innings, Waseda led 5-0 and thought they could secure the victory. However, in the top of the fifth inning, it suddenly rained. When it was the Amateurs' turn to bat, two people took the field one after another. There was a person on first base, and the next batter hit a home run. The ball flew far beyond the wire mesh on the left field, scoring two points. This boosted the team's morale. Afterwards, they scored as many as five more points. The Amateurs won with a score of 7-5. In the top of the seventh inning, Waseda was in a menacing position, occupying all three bases, but the Amateurs' defense was extremely tight, allowing only one point to be scored. In the top of the eighth inning, the Amateurs scored another point, thus defeating Waseda 8-6. The 1,223,000 Japanese fans in attendance were all dejected. Today at 3:30 p.m., Waseda will play MacLeans again at the China Baseball Field. Yesterday's scores were as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e194">Guiding Public Opinion <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Since the beginning of history, it can be said that public opinion in our country has never been on the right track. The scholars and commoners always speak without restraint and like to talk nonsense. How great is the power of the emperor! It seems that everyone should sing his praises. During the reign of Emperor Yao, the world was at peace, and nothing happened. An old man named Huai Rang-fu, over eighty years old, sang a song on the road. Onlookers said, "How great is the virtue of the Emperor!" Rang-fu said, "I work when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets. I dig a well to drink from and till the field for food. What virtue does the Emperor have for me!" This is the Rang Fu Song, which is passed down in later generations and is recorded in Emperor Wang Century. Just imagine, during the reign of Emperor Yao, the world was already in "great harmony" and the people were "free from incident," but Rang-fu was still dissatisfied and said, "What virtue does the Emperor have for me?" This seems to be slandering Emperor Yao. Fortunately, Emperor Yao was benevolent and wise and had a forgiving heart. Otherwise, wouldn't Rang-fu be in danger! This is one story of public opinion not being on the right track.</p>
<p>During the reign of King Li of Zhou, public opinion was rampant. The more he listened, the more annoyed he became, so he wanted to "prevent the people's mouths" to "stop slander." However, the result was also equal to zero. This is because he did not know how to guide public opinion.</p>
<p>Also, during the reign of Emperor Qin Shihuang, those who engaged in gossip were executed. Although the criminal law was undeniably strict to the extreme, he did not know how to guide public opinion, so it was no different from bailing water to stop boiling, and the country was eventually destroyed as a result.</p>
<p>Coming down to the late Qing Dynasty, the Qing court established the nine-year preparatory constitutionalism. The most brilliant sentence in the imperial edict was "All political affairs should be made public to public opinion." This cannot but be said to be "great imperial words." However, because no methods for guidance were established, the constitutionalism had not yet been prepared, and the Qing Dynasty was already delivered into the hands of "public opinion"!</p>
<p>A few examples are enough to prove that it is necessary to guide public opinion. As for how to guide it, I am ashamed to be a fool and have no precedent to follow, so I cannot contribute my humble opinion. The Book of Songs says, "Without knowledge, without understanding, follow the rules of the Emperor." This was a saying used to guide the scholars and commoners of the time, and public opinion can of course be included. However, times have changed, and this principle is no longer applicable. I do not know if foreign countries have good ways to guide public opinion because I have not been abroad. In short, this matter is of great importance, and proper regulations should be drafted. If they are made into established laws, then we must rely on virtuous people.</p>

<p>The Huangpu River, with its tender yellow water, screams hysterically. Beast-like warships, eyes wide with fury, glare. Massive cannons open their shining steel mouths, leering at the statue of peace on the riverbank.</p>
<p>The dredging machine trails its long iron pigtails, baring its steel-knife-like fangs, swallowing the mud and spewing it into the boat as if suffering from cholera.</p>
<p>On the docks, suffocating smoke billows, like black plum blossoms of coal ash. It flies onto the bodies of the coolies. Heavy wooden crates press down on their shoulders, their arms twitching with rat-like muscle contractions. Step by agonizing step, they climb the thread-like gangplank. Crystalline beads of sweat race down their backs. "Hang yo, hang yo," their cries sound like wounded wolves howling wildly in the silent midnight, painful tears welling in their eyes. Meanwhile, the gold-domed Sassoon House raises its head and laughs at them.</p>
<p>Merchant ships sailing from beyond the Wusong estuary float alongside the docks, spewing white foam. Though many coolies unload the heavy burdens from their bellies, black fumes still puff from their long mouths, as if trying to alleviate the fatigue of their long journeys.</p>
<p>The saltwater girl smokes, blowing round, mesmerizing smoke rings like a fish blowing bubbles. Her enchanting pupils glance sidelong at a group of white sailors, who swarm around like flies to rotten meat.</p>
<p>Under the street trees that spread like green gauze umbrellas, Chinese nannies stroll with Pekingese dogs. Several foreign children, with toy wooden guns slung on their backs, happily eat toffee and jump around. Jiangbei children, searching for seashells, look at their bright silk clothes, and a sense of sorrow invades their pure hearts. They smile bitterly, wipe the mud from their legs with their blue cloth gowns, and walk towards the Sixteen Pups area.</p>

<p>Only Seeking Room and Board, Not Caring About Salary</p>
<p>In Shanghai, earning fifty yuan a month is considered “eating well.” Unfortunately, buying a shirt and trousers for the wife, some pastries for the children, cannot be considered wasteful. Plus, one's own beard stubble needs shaving. Saving money in the bank is simply an empty dream. Every day feels like being so pressured by life that one can't even stretch a little. But do you think this is okay?</p>
<p>Especially since Shanghai is like a big rice bucket, people from all over rush here to find food. Out of ten thousand people, if one or two manage to hold a rice bowl, they are already considered lucky. Certainly, these lucky ones can no longer worry about the taste of the rice.</p>
<p>Professions are being squeezed out! Those who come are still like a tide. Needless to say, things are getting worse and worse. So, more and more people are only seeking room and board, not caring about salary. In other words, they only care about filling their own stomachs. They can't take care of their wives, children, and elders, so whatever they can grab, they grab!</p>
<p>This kind of phenomenon in society is, of course, terrifying. But...</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Hearing His Words, Her Heart Fluttered; His Wish to Be Ennobled Seemed Distant; Seeing His Leisure, She Admired His Dedication to the Country</p>
<p>Seeing the girl looking so dejected, Madam Jiang was puzzled. She thought that Guizhi had been subjected to some unkind words when she went to the Liu's to ask for the pills. Lying on the kang, she gently asked Guizhi: "My illness is not serious, why did I tell you to go ask for pills? If someone offends you, you’ll pout." Guizhi said: "Who offended me? Madam Liu didn't say a second word. As soon as she heard we wanted pills, she immediately agreed to get them." Madam Jiang said: "Since they didn't offend you, why are you angry?" Guizhi just lowered her head and sewed, answering casually: "I'm just feeling annoyed." Madam Jiang said: "Whether one is happy or annoyed, there's always a reason. Listening to you, it seems like you're getting annoyed for no reason at all." Guizhi said: "Of course there's a reason." Madam Jiang said: "What is it?" Guizhi said: "Don't ask me. If you ask, and I tell you, I'll be even more annoyed." Hearing this, Madam Jiang thought, "Something is strange about this. She was happy when she left, so why is she pouting now? And she said Madam Liu didn't offend her, so what is it?" As Madam Jiang thought this, her eyes kept watching Guizhi's face. Guizhi had made up her mind not to smile, nor to say anything to her mother, and just spent the whole day looking sullen. On that day, Madam Jiang was naturally puzzled. But after two days, Guizhi was still like this, and Madam Jiang began to understand that it must be the Zhao family marriage that she was unhappy with. She must have heard some words outside that day that stirred up her worries, so she just kept getting angry. This is a free era. Since the girl doesn't want this marriage, saying anything is useless. Not only will it not succeed, but even if it does succeed, the elders will suffer because of it. So why bother? Therefore, Madam Jiang suddenly understood and stopped mentioning the matter, and after half a month, the once-lively Yang-Zhao marriage faded away. (117)</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Study of Walking Posture <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>"Everyone can walk, but everyone walks differently." According to a "Walking Posture" PhD, the most appropriate posture is the "eight-character walk." The method of the "eight-character walk" is to align the left heel with the midpoint of the right foot, and the extension line of the left foot perpendicularly reaches the midpoint of the right foot. The tip of the left shoe, the tip of the right shoe, and the heel form an "isosceles triangle." Taking a step forward, the tip of the right shoe and the tip and heel of the left shoe also form an "isosceles triangle." It is said that with this posture, the center of gravity is in the "chest," so it can expand the chest.</p>
<p>The opposite of this method is called the "reverse eight-character walk." The "eight-character walk" is writing the character "eight" upside down, starting with the heel. The "reverse eight-character walk" is the opposite of the "eight-character walk." Although geometrically, it also forms an "isosceles triangle," this "eight" is written starting with the tip of the shoe. Walking with this posture, the center of gravity is also opposite of the "eight-character walk." The focus is on the "back," so most old gentlemen with a waddling gait walk with a "reverse eight-character walk."</p>
<p>The "one-character walk" is also a type of walking posture. The so-called "one-character walk" is maintaining the "parallel line" relationship between the extension lines of the left and right feet. When standing still, the two feet look like the character "one." The only wonderful use of this posture is that the "center of gravity" is in the "abdomen," which can form a "big belly." "High-class Chinese" and "tycoons" are most skilled at the "one-character walk."</p>
<p>The movement of the two feet in the "vertical one-character walk" is completely different from the "one-character walk." The "vertical one-character walk" is aligning the left heel with the right toe. Taking a step forward, aligning the right heel with the left toe. The two feet are connected to form the Arabic numeral "1." Walking with this posture can develop the "buttocks" into extremely high curves, making them plump and abundant. This is because the center of gravity of this posture is not too high or too low, but right at the buttocks. To be a "modern girl" with "rich sensuality," one must walk with the "vertical one-character walk."</p>
<p>These are the four major principles of "walking posture." Although they change endlessly and can be produced continuously, they are never outside of these few principles. If readers don't think it's meaningless, pay attention and study them, and perhaps it will be strangely interesting.</p>

<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>"What wonderful weather today!" Little Dog Dinggan thought. "I want to go to the farm and play, and see if there's anything fun or interesting."</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he ran and walked into the farm, scaring the hens to scatter in all directions, dodging left and right. He ran straight to the side of the chicken coop, where several diligent hens were busy laying eggs.</p>
<p>"Now I see something interesting," Dinggan said.</p>
<p>Just as he walked into the chicken coop, an older hen said, "Dinggan, what are you doing here? We're busy laying eggs. Please go out quickly!"</p>
<p>"I won't go out!" Dinggan said angrily and scoldingly. "Before I leave, you must teach me how to lay eggs."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll teach you," a fat, brown hen said. "Watch closely." Then she climbed into her nest! Cluck! Cluck! Cluck cluck cluck, she called for a while, and then a brown egg, just like herself, was laid.</p>
<p>"That's easy," the little dog said. "Let me try." So he climbed into the nest, squatting very comfortably. The old hen watched him from the side. Dinggan used all his wits and skills, trying to imitate the old hen's call, but the result was pitiful.</p>
<p>"It doesn't take that long," the old hen said, feeling that her nest wasn't very comfortable herself, and perhaps Dinggan thought it was very comfortable.</p>
<p>"I can't lay an egg," Dinggan said disappointedly, "but I really want to take a nap here."</p>
<p>"But I don't think you can," the old hen said.</p>
<p>"But look," Dinggan said, "I will, I'm going to do it right now."</p>
<p>"Then I'll peck you," the old hen said.</p>
<p>"Pah! I'm not afraid of your pecking," Dinggan said, "you can't hurt me."</p>
<p>"Oh, then you just watch me," the old hen said, using all her strength and pecking Dinggan hard.</p>
<p>"Woof! Woof! Woof!" Dinggan was hurt by the old hen's peck and barked loudly, immediately running away, out of the chicken coop, and running non-stop until he reached his home.</p>

<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl whose parents had died. She was truly lonely and miserable. She was so poor that she didn't even have a house, and so miserable that she didn't even have a bed. Besides the clothes she was wearing and a small piece of bread given to her by someone, she had nothing else. She had no place to live and no place to sleep, and was truly suffering unspeakably.</p>
<p>However, she was a very kind-hearted and devout person. Having no place to live, she walked alone in a certain direction, thinking that she could reach a paradise and a happy country. Unexpectedly, she met a suffering person on the road. He said,</p>
<p>"My head is extremely cold. Please give me something to cover it." Therefore, she took off her headscarf and gave it to him. As she walked a short distance further, she met a child who didn't even have a short coat to wear and was so cold that he was about to freeze to death. So she took off her short coat and gave it to him. As she walked further, someone asked her for a coat, and she also gave him one. "It's night now, and no one will see me. It's okay to take off my shirt and give it to him." She took off her shirt and gave it to the child. At this time, she had nothing left on her head, body, or in her hands. She was just standing there when suddenly several stars fell from the sky. She wasn't scared, but just watched blankly, and saw that when the stars landed on the ground, they all turned into flat, hard, bright, and shiny pieces of gold coins. Although she had just given her shirt to the child, now she found a brand new, exquisite shirt in front of her. So she gathered the gold coins on the ground, wrapped them in the shirt, and from then on, she enjoyed a lifetime of wealth and happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e201">On the Merits and Demerits of Huaide and Bao粹 <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Niu</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler does not allow any other parties within Germany, and even the subdued National Power Party can hardly survive. This seems to have quite moved some of our heroes, who are already praising his "drastic measures." But in reality, this is just one side of him and his ilk. On the other side, they are also very meticulous. There is a song to prove it:</p>
<p>The flea has become a high official,</p>
<p>Leading a gang everywhere.</p>
<p>The empress and concubines are all afraid,</p>
<p>No one dares to touch it.</p>
<p>Even if it bites and itches,</p>
<p>How can you possibly squash it?</p>
<p>Ai haha, ai haha, haha, ai haha!</p>
<p>This is a well-known world-famous song, "The Flea Song," but it has been banned in Germany. Of course, this is definitely not out of respect for fleas, but because it satirizes high officials. But it's also not because the satire is "the ramblings of old men from the previous century," but because the song is "un-German." The great and small heroes of Huaide inevitably have some areas where they are out of touch.</p>
<p>China is also a place that gives birth to meticulous figures, sometimes able to think very carefully. For example, this year, the Beijing Social Affairs Bureau petitioned the Municipal Government to ban women from raising male dogs, writing:</p>
<p>"...After investigation, the association of female humans and male dogs is not only harmful to health, but also more likely to cause shameless and obscene scandals. According to our country, a land of propriety and righteousness, this is also not allowed by custom. We hereby issue a strict ban. Except for guard dogs and hunting dogs, any male dogs kept by women will be executed without mercy, as a means of prohibition."</p>
<p>The standpoint of both countries is based on "national essence," but China's spirit is more grand, because Germany only prohibits everyone from singing that song, while China will not only make it difficult for "female humans" to keep dogs, but even "male dogs" will be beheaded. This has a great impact on Pekingese dogs. Driven by the instinct to preserve themselves and the need to adapt to the times, they will inevitably transform into "guard dog hunting dog" models.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Heart of a Man <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>"A hero does not shed tears lightly, only because he has not reached the point of heartbreak." This is a line sung by the hero Lin Chong in the famous Chinese opera "Night Flight." When I heard this line, I engraved it in my memory. I felt that it was the highest expression of the male heart.</p>
<p>So I also wanted to forge my heart like a piece of iron, enduring all the so-called suffering in the world. With tears swirling in my eyes, I would swallow them back into my stomach. I was very proud of my strength, and I scorned all feminine people.</p>
<p>But God would torment me. He made me fall in love with a person, a woman with the most delicate heart. Her emotions were so winding, her nerves were so sharp, while I was an emotionally barren child, crude and even more honest. We lived together, unable to understand each other. I scorned her, and she doubted me. Finally, one night, she cried, a heart-wrenching cry! And then, the next day, she quietly left, without any nostalgia.</p>
<p>The demon was still riding on me. I thought, should a man diminish himself for the love of a woman? I grinned and drank to celebrate the woman's escape. I even thanked God for giving me freedom again.</p>
<p>But one can never deceive oneself for long. In the depths of the night, the heart opened its eyes and softly whispered, "You love her. You can't live without her, you know?"</p>
<p>Gradually, a slight pain came from the heart. I struggled to resist it, not letting it overcome me. I, a person with the strongest male heart! I laughed maniacally, stopping the tears in my eyes, but what kind of laughter was it?</p>
<p>Have you ever wandered among desolate tombs in the deep night and heard the laughter of ghosts? That is the kind of terrible sound!</p>
<p>Next, I felt that if my emotions didn't give me some relief, I would become a spirit. Why shouldn't I cry out loud, using tears to moisten my pain, to show my repentance, and to lower my head before God and before humanity?</p>
<p>The strong, powerful, and huge hand that had always been pushing me from behind now showed its power even more, and I was completely overcome by it.</p>
<p>I lay on my pillow and cried loudly. Those tears, those precious tears! At the same time, I remembered Goethe's famous line:</p>
<p>"He who has never eaten his bread with tears,</p>
<p>Who has never spent sleepless nights</p>
<p>Weeping and waiting for the dawn,</p>
<p>He does not know you, you great powers!"</p>

<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>Several people were enjoying the cool breeze on the bridgehead. As I walked onto the bridge, they all squeezed their eyes and stopped talking. Xiao Lin asked me, "Fu Gen, is your wedding day soon?"</p>
<p>I nodded and walked past, hearing them burst into laughter behind me. The laughter was like a fire, scorching my back.</p>
<p>What's so funny? Just because a person is born a little poor, does that mean he shouldn't have a wedding day and marry a wife? Everyone says I'm foolish, but it's just that I was born a little poor. Where am I foolish? I'm twenty-three years old this year. Normally, people my age would have been married and had children long ago. But me, the girls far and near all like me but are unwilling to marry me. Isn't that because I'm poor? My dad was so angry that I couldn't get married that he said he would buy land as dowry to win back this honor, even if the whole family went hungry afterward. Now the marriage is finally settled. Although the girl lives far away, I heard that she is very young and her family is well-off. My dad is happy, and I'm happy too. Even the gifts and jewelry have already cost more than a thousand dollars. The matchmakers are Elder Xiang Sheng and Mr. You Sheng.</p>
<p>So I turned around and spat at them. They were gesturing and talking happily. Seeing me turn around, Xiao Lin raised his hand and shouted loudly, "Fu Gen, your wife won't be coming through the door today. The wedding won't happen."</p>
<p>The wedding won't happen? What a load of crap. If she hasn't come in two days, it's because the road is so far, and two days is naturally not enough to get here. But she must come today. Wasn't my dad just telling me to urge Elder Xiang Sheng to talk with him about it? I believe the bride will definitely come.</p>
<p>Elder Xiang Sheng wasn't home. When I turned back, the people on the bridge had all scattered. The sky had already turned dark. Dad heard that he wasn't home and sent someone to invite Mr. You Sheng, but he wasn't home either. Someone said that there must have been a change of plans and the matchmakers were hiding. Everyone was helpless and the guests all sighed and dispersed. Could it be that something had really changed with the wedding? I couldn't figure out the mystery, but seeing my dad's face, it seemed very difficult.</p>
<p>This was the third day. When I got up in the morning, everyone seemed to have forgotten about the events of the previous two days, and the guests became lively again as usual. I had been worried all night, and I was finally able to settle down a bit. Dad sent someone to the girl's home in Qibao Bridge early in the morning to urge them to come. Xiao Lin's words couldn't be accurate. After the wedding day is over, I'll spit in his face. ...</p>
<p>...However, however, it was getting late again. The guests in the hall were all wiping their sweat and talking about it. But the bride still didn't appear. Dad sighed and said, "We've been tricked."</p>
<p>What trick? Could it be that the wedding won't happen again this time? I couldn't believe it. I thought it was Xiao Lin who was causing trouble in the middle, otherwise how would he have known in advance that my wedding wouldn't happen?</p>
<p>So I wanted to go find him and settle the score. I went to his house. He was already gone, he had run away. I went to the bridge, and a group of people were gathered there. I saw Xiao Lin in the middle. He couldn't dodge in time and was grabbed by me. He hadn't expected that I would find him here.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I slapped him twice in the face first. He turned his head and shouted, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, "What trick did you play to prevent me from having a wedding?" Everyone around me burst out laughing. Xiao Lin struggled in my hands, trying to escape, but I held him tightly. They had agreed not to help each other. Hands reached out from all sides, and then they snatched Xiao Lin away from my hands. I fell to the ground myself. They laughed as they held me to the ground. Someone said, "Come and see the foolish bridegroom! We'll give him a wedding today."</p>
<p>I fainted in their hands. When I woke up, there was only me left on the bridge, and frogs were croaking all around, just like their laughter. I decided to jump into the water, but then I thought, maybe the bride has already entered the door? So I stood up and walked down the bridge.</p>
<p>I thought the bride wouldn't not come. The road is so far, and three days is naturally not enough to get here.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Finale of the Gongs and Drums <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Having already written the article "Revisiting the Gongs and Drums," I recently heard that Mr. Luo Fu has already written a rebuttal, but it has not yet been published (Editor's note: i.e., Mr. Luo Fu's article from yesterday). I don't know what he will say. I expect he has some new and wonderful interpretations. There is no doubt about that. But I am ashamed of my meager knowledge and have no literary baggage to display. Still, I dare to write this third article, one to somewhat exhaust the meaning of my previous articles, and the other to hope to obtain the high opinion of an expert in music. A scholar discussing opera is a presumptuous illusion. The actual situation on the stage, I dare to question and truly appreciate.</p>
<p>However, I have a few things to clarify. One is that I fear readers will be dazzled by the confusion, and the other is that I want to prevent the debater from digressing from the main point. Therefore, in my previous two articles, I did not hesitate to reiterate the key points. First, "Speaking of Kunqu Opera, has it ever not valued gongs and drums?" I cited the words of Li Liweng and Tong Fumin as proof. I am merely quoting old sayings, not offering new interpretations. If there are any errors, I will not take responsibility. Second, I speculate on the historical origins of gongs and drums and martial arts in our old operas, believing that they came from wrestling matches and dance dramas with masks from the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Thus, I say that China has had drama as a concept since its origin. Gongs and drums have been inseparable from it. I am only saying that there are gongs and drums, not that the types and ways of playing the gongs and drums are the same as they are today. Third, I say that the words in Gu's "Casual Talks from the Guest Seat," referring to the large four-part suites of northern opera, inserting miscellaneous skills such as "cuo dian quan," "dancing Guanyin," "hundred-foot banner," or "jumping duizi" as martial arts, are clearly remnants of miscellaneous skills in acrobatics. However, I have only read dozens of kinds of Yuan dramas from northern opera. I am completely ignorant of the actual situation on the stage. I can only comment on this and dare not pretend to be an expert.</p>
<p>What I want to add now is that Mr. Luo Fu said, "Around the Wanli period of the Ming dynasty, neither northern opera nor southern opera used gongs and drums at all," and also said, "Southern opera initially did not use gongs and drums." He said that because I cited Li Liweng's words on gongs and drums as proof, and then said that "Liweng's theory was published when Kunqu Opera was declining," this was the biggest loophole in my argument. I have already refuted this in my repeated arguments. Wei Liangfu's "Music Laws" says: "Singing without accompaniment is called 'cold bench.' It is not like the momentum of gongs and drums on the stage. It requires elegance, solemnity, freshness, and gentleness." Wei was the founder of Kunqu Opera, and his theories on music already included gongs and drums. How can you strongly claim that "around the Wanli period of the Ming dynasty, neither northern opera nor southern opera used gongs and drums at all?" Only Mr. Luo Fu has this bold new interpretation. And he boasts that it is correct. Furthermore, Zhu Zhuzhai's "Poetry Talks from the Quiet Dwelling" says that when Kang Dui Shan died, his family had nothing of value except three hundred pairs of waist drums. Lu Kanru's "Poetry History" says that there were three hundred pairs of large and small drums. According to research, Kang Hai was a person from the Chenghua and Jiajing periods, about the same time as Wei Liangfu, or slightly earlier. He was a famous northern opera author at the time. It has not been heard that he also worked on southern opera. What was he storing drums for? The number is especially alarming. But I dare not rush to offer a new interpretation, saying that it is proof that northern opera had gongs and drums.</p>
<p>This is the extent of my argument, and this is the extent of my response. In political disputes, one often views the gains and losses like chickens and insects. To use writing as weapons again, how can I still have a thatched heart!</p>

<p>丨With the Strongest Upward Trend丨</p>
<p>Market Closed Yesterday Due to Holiday</p>
<p>From June 26th to July 1st this week, the market was closed on Thursday (June 29th) for June futures settlement and on Saturday (July 1st) due to bank holiday. Only four days of trading actually occurred, and there is little to report. Most remained stable, due to the June settlement. Trading was light, and fluctuations were minimal. Among them, only the '96 public bonds were particularly active, with a mostly straight upward trend. Trading was also more active than any other bond. The reason for the sharp rise is nothing more than speculators using its low market value to drive up the price, misleading short sellers. The rumors in the market are unfounded. When the reaction comes, it will be severe, so be careful. Monday was the last day for June futures. Most of the long and short positions were squared, so the amount of short and long covering was very small that day, and the market price fluctuated up and down. Only the July contracts were traded on Tuesday, and the settlement was light. The result was a slight increase of two or three jiao, while the '96 bonds rose by seven jiao and a half. On Wednesday, the August contracts were added. Only one '96 contract was offered, and the market price was very stable. The '96 bonds rose another six jiao. The market was closed on Thursday for settlement. On Friday, the '96 bonds rose sharply. Various parties had strong demand, and the market was extremely lively. The price fluctuations were also significant, with twenty or thirty prices quoted for each round. There were quite a few spot deliveries and purchases of spot goods this time, but speculators still accounted for the majority. Initially, trading was dominated by the Northern Gang, but later all gangs were very active. If it is a purposeless, sharp rise, then the advance will be rapid and the retreat will be quick, which is inevitable. In summary, the results of this week's market prices, except for the newly opened August contracts, which cannot be compared, June only had one day of trading, and the market price was slightly lower by three to five jiao compared to the previous week, while the 20% consolidated salt tax all rose by two or three jiao. The July contracts all rose, by about three to five jiao. The Jin Chang bonds rose by one yuan and seven jiao, while the '96 bonds alone rose by three yuan and two jiao. The total transaction volume was 38,589,000 yuan, including 14,000 yuan in spot goods. Among the futures, the '96 bonds accounted for the largest number, at 9,230,000. Salt tax accounted for only 7,425,000, consolidated tax accounted for 4.35 million, disarmament bonds accounted for 4 million, the 19% open interest bonds accounted for 3,525,000, and the 20% consolidated bonds accounted for 6,070,000. The remaining amounts ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>New Fung Yang Company reported that on Friday (30th), the New York stock market was still fluctuating and trading was light. Later, due to the excellent railway freight report for the week ending June 24th, totaling 604,668 cars, an increase of 16,737 cars compared to the previous week, railway stocks took the lead, and other stocks followed suit. Trading picked up, and prices rose by one to four yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 3.67 million shares. The total trading volume in June was 125,619,530 shares, creating a new high in the history of rising markets, second only to July of 1929. Looking at the current stock market situation, railway stocks and railway equipment stocks seem likely to continue to advance. American cotton is used to replace stable currency prices due to government restrictions on excessive exchange rate fluctuations, so the closing price is still steady. Wheat rose due to poor wheat varieties, and general purchases. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left,</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, and the situation was very tight. It was heard that manufacturers convened a meeting in the afternoon, claiming that raw material prices were high and there was a shortage of goods, and there was talk of stopping clothing production. As a result, people were agitated, and short sellers suddenly appeared panicked, and those who covered their positions became more enthusiastic, so the market price rose sharply.</p>
<p>(Recent Yarn Prices Up Two Yuan)</p>
<p>The opening price in the forward market was flat for American cotton, and sentiment was scattered. Prices for each month fell by 1.4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that yarn mills were in trouble and the talk of production cuts was brought up again. Buying surged, and prices for each month rose by 1.7, 8, and 9 jiao to 3.7 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 77,500 bales. 2,350 bales of Jifeng were sold, 500 bales each of Senkang and Changfeng, 4,650 bales of Changfeng, 2,450 bales of Chongan, 3,200 bales of Dafeng, and 2,800 bales of Yuanda. 5,400 bales of Dachang were bought, 2,650 bales of Tonghe, 1,900 bales of Xincheng, 2,450 bales of Hengchang, 2,400 bales of Renfeng, 1,550 bales of Yichang, 2,150 bales of Changji, 1,350 bales of Tongfu, and 1,650 bales of Lichang.

<p>The cotton market was slightly weak due to flat foreign cotton prices and softening sentiment. There were widespread rumors in the market that American cotton would arrive in Shanghai soon, and that factories would use less raw materials after suspending production. All kinds of news were beneficial to short sellers, so selling was more active. However, some people believed that since yarn prices were already high, the cotton market could not fall alone, and there was no risk of a sharp fall in American cotton prices, so buyers were very active. The market still relied on American cotton for its advances and retreats.</p>
<p>(Retail Investors Sell Zheng Cotton)</p>
<p>The opening price of Zheng Cotton was released, and retail investors sold, and the market atmosphere was weak. Prices for each month fell by 6 and 7 jiao. The afternoon remained flat, and prices for each month rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 124,700 dan. 7,800 dan of Tongxing were sold, 6,400 dan of Changhe, 3,100 dan of Shenchang, and 4,100 dan of Senkang. 2,600 dan of Dachang were bought, 6,800 dan of Yuanda, 2,400 dan of Yuchang, 2,600 dan of Tonghe, 2,500 dan of Yichang, 4,200 dan of Ruida, and 3,300 dan of Delong.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market began to fall due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by longs, but the trend was firm at the close.

Egyptian cotton's spot prices fell by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market was initially weak due to limit-price sellers, but later rebounded due to speculative buying and short covering. As a result, Bengal rose by 2 rupees, Oomra rose by 7.5 jiao, and White Rawxi rose by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated June 30th):</p>

<p>New York, June 30th, reports on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of the week, news of the cotton field reduction campaign spread, coupled with strong wheat market, stable cotton cloth, and general industrial activity picking up, there were cries of poor cotton crops in the Southwest cotton belt. Speculators bought in droves, and cotton prices rose sharply. Profit-taking followed, and sales in the South also increased. The fluctuating rise and fall of foreign exchange, the contradictory news of currency stability in various countries, and its final impact on the expansion plan in the United States, later caused confusion in the cotton cloth market. Regarding the reduction of cotton fields, the initial news was extremely optimistic. Some farmers, in view of the sharp rise in prices, gradually expressed their unwillingness to remove their cotton, which was still growing. However, the official market issued a warning that if the acreage reduction plan fails, the existing relatively high prices will not last long. The weather bureau reported that the new cotton crop can withstand unharmed under dry weather conditions. The government report estimating cotton fields on July 8 will not take into account any reductions.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The source is only the 11th and 12th. The shop appetites in this street have turned lax, and the situation has become a balance between arrival and sales. The market is stable, and the prices of all regular Bang, Su Tong Bang, Nanhang, and other thick japonica and Du Yangjian are all unchanged. Baowei Yantai Bang purchased about 1,000 bales of Qingjiao, Songsi, and other thin rice, but the eating plate is tight, and the trend seems to have faded. Fortunately, the arrival of goods is slightly scarce, and the market price has not risen or fallen, but looking at noon, it has already shown a soft appearance, and it is expected that the material market may have a slight modification today. Yin Bian Yuan still appears to be standing out.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads were scarce, only the 12th and 3rd. The sales of white japonica rice in the market continued to be smooth, and the weather was cloudy and humid. The customers tightened and left, causing the price to increase by 1 or 2 jiao. The thin japonica and Du Jian also added nearly jiao. The port customers' sharp price brought a tight trend. The arrival of Bai Yuan at the beginning was slightly available, and retail sales continued to sell. The market was tall and stable in the secondary position.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Du Ke Xian Sales Active, Slight Increase <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of Du Xian by customers was still active, and the Min and Zhejiang roads continued to inquire. In addition to purchasing various types of brown rice from the inland, the Min Bang also purchased from the river port and the association in this city. Yesterday, they also inquired about various types of Hunan Jing brown rice. The market's popularity is very good. Except for red rice, which is relatively flat, all other types of Xian rice have risen by three to five fen. The Jingxi Xian rice is particularly standing out. The entire day, 1,100 bales were processed from Fuzhou to Hunan Jing, priced at 6 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. Also, 550 bales of red brown, priced at 7 yuan and 1 jiao to 7 yuan. The Wentai Bang paid attention to Jing Xian, so other than Fuzhou slightly removing more than 200 bales, the Wentai Bang totaled more than 300 bales of Xixiang, priced at 7 yuan and 6 jiao, 420 bales of Jing Xian, priced at 7 yuan and 2 jiao, and 150 bales of Hunan Jingjing, priced at 7 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. In addition, the Min Bang also processed hundreds of bales of Heshai Dujian, and the price was not much different.</p>

<p>After the market opened this morning, the prices of flour in each month showed weakness, because it was rumored that the first batch of American wheat had begun to be shipped to China, and because there were 2 million bags of Australian flour stored in Tianjin, which could not be sold, and there would be a suspension of sales to the north in the future, and new wheat was pouring in and being sold in the mainland, and the factory continued to sell, so after the opening, each month fell uniformly. In the afternoon, it was even softer. The closing price was slightly less than 2.25 points this month, slightly less than 2.75 points next month, slightly less than 2.75 points in September, slightly less than 2.5 points in October, and slightly less than 1.5 points in November. The price in December was also slightly less than 1 point compared to the opening price in the morning.</p>
<p>The opening price of wheat was also small, because American wheat began to be loaded and new goods arrived, causing people's hearts to be weak and soft, and various parties competed to sell. The market was even more tired at the close, with ninety-nine small points each at eight points, seven months small at five points, eight months up six points, and November small at six points. On the whole day, 15,000 bags of spot wheat were opened, and Fuzhou and Feng each removed 6,7000 bags, and the rest were processed by small factories. The market price of high goods stood up, and the middle and secondary goods were soft.</p>

<p>The broad bean market has recently seen fewer sources due to the fact that cargo owners in various producing areas are unwilling to sell cheaply, and buyers are still inquiring about the law one after another. With the cargo owners selling, there is a hope of recovery. Yesterday, Xiaoli broad beans in Hankou were sold at 3 yuan and 5 jiao, with 400 bags being sold. They were processed by foreign banks.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign banks' tea market, foreign firms such as the Russian Aid Association were still continuing to select and purchase black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and other regions. However, the firm has changed the method of paying for tea in this purchase to a half-cash and half-credit method. Although many Chinese tea merchants are selling reluctantly, the selling price is still extremely low. The market conditions are very weak. The European firms are still very interested in purchasing Lu Zhuang's Pingshui green tea. The market for high-grade Zhenmei Pearl Tea has once again increased by 4 or 5 yuan. The trading of medium and low-grade Zhenmei Xiu Mei and other designs is also extremely active. The total transaction volume of red and green tea in the city reached more than 6,300 boxes, with black tea accounting for only one-fifth of the total. The situation can be seen.</p>

<p>New Zhengzhou vegetables and Hankou arrived in 26 pieces. The goods are complete. They were processed directly by Guang Bang, and the price was 26 taels, which was about 2 yuan better than the first plate. Three pieces of Zhongzhuang goods also arrived here, about 30 yuan and have not yet been sold.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Textile Goods: White Adhesive Cloth, White Yarn, and Twill Selling Well <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>White adhesive cloth, also known as canvas, is mostly called double yarn adhesive cloth by the wool industry. Most of the industry is engaged in the sale of this cloth, which is the only Western clothing fabric in the summer. White yarn twill is also the same. Old-brand goods such as Haohua Three Deer Head are specified by buyers from our customer base. There is a considerable sales market every year, and its selling price is 5 or 6 fen more expensive than other ordinary brands. Most schools adopt ordinary Shiwu brand, and its sales market can be pushed to the first in the summer. Both retail and wholesale are being sold. Three Deer Head yarn twill adhesive cloth sells for 6 jiao, the highest price for ordinary miscellaneous brands is 5 jiao and 6 fen, and the lowest is 5 jiao and 2 fen half.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Thoughts on Identifying the Authenticity of Tung Oil <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Since white tung oil began to be sold to Europe and the United States, it has been four or five years ago, when exports were at their peak, and prices soared to more than forty taels per dan. Because the price is high and the profit is thick, there are endless ways to fake it. At first, the heart of the cypress was mixed in (that is, the kernel inside the cypress seed). Because it has the effect of regulating both sexes, it is still relatively decent. After that, things got worse and worse. Almost all oils that were cheaper than white tung oil were mixed in, and even mineral yellow oil (spindle oil) was the main ingredient for faking it. Only a few reputable firms are not willing to be completely bad. For those who only seek profit, the goods they sell are only 20% to 30% genuine tung oil. As for identifying the authenticity, it is absolutely not easy, so foreign firms must use specific gravity equipment to test the degree. Roughly speaking, among vegetable oils, tung oil has the highest degree. Genuine original tung oil has a degree between 1.5170. Therefore, what foreign firms handle is at least 1.5168. If it does not reach this degree, the goods will be returned. For this reason, the goods for export cannot be faked and are still original. What is sold domestically is completely unbearable. Those who are deceived are the users, who may be greedy for a little cheapness and suffer a great loss. If you want to identify the authenticity with your eyes, it is really not easy. The usual way to look is to first observe its color, which is light and tender yellow, and there is no kerosene gloss on the surface. Then smell its odor, which is purely the odor of tung oil and has no other odors. The texture is heavy, and at temperatures below fifty degrees, it freezes like yellow wax. Moreover, tung oil is heavy, while yellow oil is a mineral product and is light. Heavy things sink, and light things float. If you observe carefully, it is not difficult to understand. If you have this vision, you will not be deceived.</p>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil is made from white tung oil, so it has no way to be exported. White tung oil can still be faked, and Hongjiang tung oil must be faked even more severely. There is a distinction between genuine and counterfeit brands. The quality of the goods is only distinguished by the brand names of various oil presses. Although each has a registered trademark, they are not taken seriously. The so-called "certain brand" and "certain brand" on the market are all the brand names of the oil presses. Its origin is far away in Hongjiang Town, southern Hunan, and most of its sales are in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, counterfeiting and other things are also in the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas. Because Hongjiang tung oil has no degree to test after being transformed, it is even more difficult to identify. It all relies on the three aspects of color, smell, and taste to judge the authenticity, which is very difficult. Some use the residue from the oil press and mix it in, and some refine the yellow oil and remove its odor, so that it is not distinguished by insiders. Users can only look at its color, bright light, and pure smell. However, if buyers recognize the brand name, there are counterfeit brands, so you must observe the authenticity of the trademark. However, there are also cases where the bucket is a real bucket and the oil is fake oil. It can be said that there is nothing that cannot be done, and it is impossible to distinguish everything. You can only ask for a more reputable store.</p>
