<p>時評</p>
<p>國聨顧問委員會與熱河</p>
<p>（一）日本積極侵略</p>
<p>國際聨盟大會採用十九委員會報告書之後。公道之勝利。即告一段落。同時邀請美蘇兩國參加所謂顧問委員會。而蘇聨以觀點不同。已明白表示拒絕。美國則附不受拘束而有自由之條件。表示與國聨合作。對禁運軍火。及拒絕承認滿洲僞國之實施方案。現已開始分組討論。然而三星期之前。日本軍隊即挑動戰爭動員兵力合計在五萬以上。加以僞國叛軍三萬餘人。盡力侵我熱河。旬日之間。我方失地竟至五十八萬方里。其時雖異。其勢則與九一八當時如出一轍。其所以進展如此之速。我方竟至無法抵抗者。蓋抵抗已處於被動地位。而飢兵窳械。復加以湯玉麟之昏庸。宜其不能抗也。國際間在九一八事變之初。羣相驚訝。皆責日本帝國主義之兇横。思有以確保遠東國際均衡之局面。乃此次之事。類皆默然不作一語。迄夫熱河失守。丨丨流血遍野。亦不視爲戰爭。其又何故耶。一則我國未嘗出其金力以爭此一塊土再則美國金融恐慌。已達頂點。資本主義國家。皆受影響。故不能不急其目前之急。而任日本之横行也</p>
<p>當日本軍閥準備進攻之初。即倡言熱河滿洲僞國之領土。宣傳我國對彼增兵。有奪取僞國之企圖。同時在山海關一試窺我國是否眞抵抗。藉察熱河省内之虚實。及至熱河失陷。彼仍宣言决不侵入關内。而同時乃分遣重兵。以步兵第十六旅團。由川原侃率攻古北口第十四旅團（屬旭川第七師團）由服部兵次郎率攻喜峯口。第三十三旅團（第十師團所屬）中村馨率攻冷口。古北口方面。並由第八師團在承德策應。而喜峯口及冷口。則由第六師團長坂本政右衛門在凌源指揮。目前雖未一舉入關。至少則欲乘此時機。襲取我沿邊各隘口。自古北口。而潘家口。喜峯口。界嶺口。冷口。以至於石門塞山海關各要隘。皆爲攻擊目標如我軍眞正抵抗。則將借口我國挑撥戰爭。彼即乘勢增兵。奪取河北邊境各地。作將來進窺平津之地步。如我軍仍繼續退讓。則於刧制長城之後。倡爲劃設中立區之說。以便整理其遠足行軍之部卒。待至相當時日。必仍用奪取熱河故技。以施之於河北。此又不待多言者也。然則彼何爲又倡劃中立區之說哉。吾人審知日本帝國主義。雖對我中國。逞强用兵。而其國内經濟恐慌。實已達乎極點。復遇美國金融狂潮之襲來。其農村破敗。必愈顯露。生絲工業之危機。更將加速發展至於不可收拾。彼不能無後顧之憂。故不得不亟　彌補其經濟危機。整備其軍實。並欲藉以緩和國際問之嫉視。減少外交上之困難。所謂設立中立區域之主旨在此。非有絲釐親善之意於國。更無任何和症之意圖。</p>
<p>（二）國際聨盟無可如何</p>
<p>國際聨盟之組織。與夫其内藴實力吾人對之。早具相當認識與理解。此次十九委員會報告書爲國聨大會採擇之後。國人頗希望其能仗義執言運用盟約第十六條。對日本加以經濟上有效之制裁。實行護持世界上之和平與公理。並以促起日閥之醒悟。殊不知國聨雖爲提倡和平機關。而實際僅能作道德上之裁制。所謂公理正義之背後。尤須有鋼與汽油煤炭等之底力。我國天賦誠厚。然鐵與煤皆埋藏地中。人力尙不是以充分取用。是故公理僅屬他人之公理。我國及我國。民本身。仍居被動地位。證之九一八禍變以來。迄今一年有半。敎訓何如。吾人當深思而痛自反省者也。</p>
<p>日本之所以退出國聨。不再圖樽俎折衝者蓋以當世各小國强硬主持正義攫取東北三省之爲一種侵略行爲。已爲世界所共知。長此辯爭。其有損於日本信譽者尙小。而影響於其繼續用兵之行動者實大。矧日本攻掠熱河之準備。已同箭在弦上。國聨之不能公然承認戰爭。亦至明顯。是以日本採用不顧一切之單獨侵呑政策也。</p>
<p>蘇聨地跨歐亞之間。（赤化）蔓延。宿爲日本所恐懼。然彼方潛心於國内建設。盡力於第二五年計劃之開端其不肯對日開釁。勢甚瞭然。北美合衆國又因經濟恐慌。使歐洲情勢。更見困難。盟約十六條之運用丨丨經濟封鎖丨。將遂成爲歷史上之名詞。白紙上之黑字而已。</p>
<p>是故二十一國顧問委員會討論滿洲事變審議尙未開始。而熱河烽烟已起。竊恐否認滿洲僞國之案未能實施。戰亂將愈見其擴大。總之。此一問題解决之樞紐。不在日内瓦之國聨。而在我國民將如何運用（實力。）如何以鐵拳答覆日本之暴行也。</p>

<p>麥唐納說明　　軍縮新方案</p>
<p>首請以自由公道予德國</p>
<p>軍備平等非可一蹴而就</p>
<p>提訂五年軍縮公約</p>
<p>謀樹世界和平基礎</p>
<p>日内瓦　英相麥唐納今日在軍縮會議總委員會提出一向來未見之最痛快嚴峻計劃、宣稱、軍縮會議之現行方法、其功效已達於限度、吾人誠欲使减縮軍備有眞正之成就、此時必須採取勇敢邁進之步驟而後可、麥氏並於提出英國計劃之前、展其雄辯長才、作一針見血之快舉、逕在字裏行間隠指德法態度爲世界協調之大梗、如謂邇來之行事與演說、旣不能有助於諸君之與會艱巨工作、顯指德國希特勒政府狂熱國家主義而發、又謂對於德國必須給予自由與公道、但（貢獻）須出於雙方、應請雙方對於世界和平與軍縮及信任上俱有（貢獻）、又警告在座諸人、謂互國會議不僅允許軍備平等、但規定國家所握之武力、决不能用以解决爭執、而平等一層亦必須逐步達到、不能一蹴而幾等語、顯皆對德而發、此外又稱、和平問題全屬心理的、苟非造成一種空氣、使疑雲不能發生、則疑雲終不能釋亦似對德法而發、</p>
<p>按今日總委員會開會前、外間聞英相麥唐納演說消息、爭往旁聽、數分鐘内廣大議塲旁聽席座爲之滿、後至者幾無揷足地、</p>
<p>麥氏首即聲稱、英國計劃請求一九三五年召集各海軍國會議、又謂諸君或將感覺此次所請於諸君者、未免冒險太甚、故請諸君先行研究此計劃、然後再提修改主張、</p>
<p>提訂五年公約</p>
<p>英國計劃具五大特點、（一）規定五年之久、（二）减縮軍備而非重置軍軍備、（三）規定國際管理軍備、（四）第一次擬定切實數額、（五）設置籌備續减軍備之機關、</p>
<p>全歐陸軍普减</p>
<p>麥氏續謂英國計劃提議歐陸各國陸軍在按照法國計劃所提議者悉令符合標準後、即行普减三分之一、</p>
<p>又關於一九三五年召集各海軍國會議一層、麥氏聲稱、倘前此海軍條約尙嫌不普通、則並非吾輩之咎、</p>
<p>廢除軍用航空</p>
<p>麥氏嗣又發表此次計劃中提議、苟能覓致保障不改商用飛機爲軍用之方法、則當完全廢除陸海軍用航空、</p>
<p>最後麥氏聲稱、倘此次復告失敗、則事勢之進展迅將逐諸君陷入巨災、蓋失敗之後、必將增加作戰之情感、豈吾人所有之仇視戰爭與武力解决爭執等尙嫌不足耶</p>
<p>英國計劃大綱</p>
<p>至英國計劃之大綱</p>
<p>停止建造新艦（一）完全停造一切主力艦至一九三五年爲止、獨意國得造一艘、法國則自軍縮會議開會以來已建造命坎克號巡洋艦之龍骨矣、（二）除倫敦海軍條約所規定者外、同時停造八時徑砲巡洋艦、</p>
<p>取銷不平條文（三）取銷凡爾賽和約中限制德國海軍條文但德國海軍在事實上須保留現在地位至一九三六年底爲止限制大砲口徑（四）可移動之陸地大砲、將來限制最大口徑不得過一○五公厘、但現有大砲得保留至一五五公厘海岸防禦砲限至四○六公厘、（五）限制坦克車不得過十六噸、</p>
<p>禁止天空轟炸（六）完全禁止天空轟炸、規定海陸空飛行具不得空逾三噸、（未載物重量）各大國之空軍實力、英法日意蘇俄與美國同、以海陸飛機共五百架爲限、（七）禁止化學毒菌縱火戰爭、（八）僅限制歐陸各國陸軍設立永久軍縮委員會公約、代替限制德奥匃布軍縮約内規定、規定各國兵額（九）各國兵力提議法四十萬、意二十五萬、德二十萬、波蘭二十萬、羅馬尼亞十萬、（十）法國四十萬人中、半數必須駐本國、意軍則二十萬駐國内、五萬往海外、波蘭蘇俄之軍額、則連駐紥國内外者併計、</p>
<p>消弭戰爭辦法按英國計劃係製成公約方式提出、其第一章係論述國家安全問題、以非戰公約爲基礎、並宣稱、倘有違犯非戰公約而起戰爭情事、則遇五大國中任何一國要求召集會議時、則應有關各方應舉行會議、並同意採取足以决定某方應負違約責任之步驟、</p>
<p>各方交口稱譽</p>
<p>麥氏演畢、法總理達拉第即稱述、麥氏計劃中之高尙願望、允作同情的研究、美代表吉伯生稱、麥氏提議可使軍縮前進一大步、但聲明美政府鑒於此項公約過於重要、不應倉卒考慮、故美代表不準備立即討論、並稱讚麥氏所示之融洽精神、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>英相羅馬之行</p>
<p>日内瓦　法總理達拉第及外長彭古、明日下午二時啓程回巴黎、英首相麥唐納及外相西門同時啓程赴羅馬、法總理及外長因英當局親自來法、不久擬赴倫敦答拜云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　國權黨之（德意志總彚報）評論英相麥唐納之赴羅馬、謂（英相此行所能產生之行動、僅爲對羅卡洛條约担任保障之各國間一種行動而已、）該報又謂、意大利主張軍縮會、議延會英國主張對軍縮問題、作一種臨時解决、此種辦法、是否不爲一種有害於德國之折衷方案、殊不可知云、（按本電所稱對羅卡洛條約担任保障之各國、即指英國及意大利而言、）（十六日哈瓦電）</p>
<p>倫敦　意國各報聞英首相麥唐納與外相西門將至羅馬消息、均以熱切之論調表示歡迎、英政法家不請意相墨索里尼至北意某城會晤、而親蒞羅馬、足徵其徵求意國意見之殷切、且此次會晤、適在麥氏於軍縮會議中提出建議之後、意國尤爲滿意、蓋可使兩國政治家討論大局、並詳騐各國對此提案之有可反動也、羅馬遞信報向來發表官塲意見者、今徵實此次會晤所討論者、以軍縮爲主要問題之說、惟謂國際衝突原因當然亦將考慮及之云、外交界現信德國時局、亦將在討論諸問題之列、因希特勒握權後、局勢已爲一變也、麥唐納或將請墨索里尼用其勢力勸希特勒勿操切行事、致促成歐洲事變云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>美國表示擁護</p>
<p>台維斯任正式軍縮代表</p>
<p>紐約　據紐約各報華盛頓消息、美國準備擁護英國軍縮建議、俾消滅戰爭之憂慮、並建立歐洲經濟之協調云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓今日國務院聲稱、美政府將就權力所能爲、力求避免軍縮會議之失敗、因此派台維斯以大使資格往日内瓦、担任美國首席代表、據聞國務卿史汀生對於任何減縮軍備與足以減輕捐稅負担合理計畫、皆願完全合作、第現政府雖欲獲最美滿之減縮、但亦不必定須堅持共和黨提議之統減三分之一計畫、聞台維斯至日内瓦後、將力勸各國立即切實減縮、至羅斯福總統與國務卿赫爾是否擬有新提議、尙無所聞、台氏現擬於下星期初赴歐、按台氏實際任爲總統駐歐大使、並將出席經濟會議云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>法報恣意抨掌</p>
<p>巴黎　麥唐納氏之軍縮救濟方案、現雖尙未公佈、外間所知者僅大其節略槪、但法國與論今已一致羣起攻擊、且豫告法國政府之將加以拒絕、斐加羅報認麥氏之方案爲不可接受、而微言報則謂該方案之用意、在使人人滿意、但其結果則無人滿意、巴黎廻聲報主筆波丁南氏則公然責間麥唐納究竟有無國際仲裁員之資格、並指斥麥氏之赴意有勾結墨索里尼、以法意海軍均勢爲餌、而使法國獨蒙其害之用意、巴黎日報則稱、法國無論如何决不願承認法意兩國有海軍均等之可能、並認法意海軍均等一切、實爲麥氏提案之主體云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>日本含譏帶諷</p>
<p>東京　日本對於英國最近提出之軍縮建議、不甚法意、因覺其純對歐洲而發也、日本海軍界以爲建議中絕少新頴之資料並對實行限制飛機能否成功一節、表示疑慮、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>會後議論紛紜</p>
<p>日内瓦　英相麥唐納所提出之計劃、成爲軍縮會議休息室内一切談話之目標、各國代表團均於今晨詳細審議、大部分代表團均擬各返本國京城、俾與其政府磋商、就日内瓦所接到各國報紙之評論、足見各國印象與此問談話情形、大致相同、德國方面以爲英國計劃、並非眞正軍縮計劃、且非難此種計劃、謂不能滿足軍備平等之諾言、但德人對於麥唐納所稱該計劃非一成不變一語予以備案、德國方面擬提出重要修正案多起云、意大利方面似因英相親訪墨索里尼、乃保持審愼沉默之態度、意大利代表團之態度、要亦不外乎此、英國計劃對於空軍縮减問題、有一切實結果、即空軍委員會認爲應延緩工作、俾克研究麥唐納計劃中之空軍條欵、雖軍縮會議主席漢特森勸令繼續開會、亦已置之不問、麥唐納昨日演說中有一節謂（余有最所尊敬之友人、日前曾發表甚爲嚴重之言論、此人實係國際和平之偉大擁護者、余對此友人有極大之信賴、蓋因彼盡力於和平甚多故也、此友人之言曰、德國須獲得公道與自由之待遇非然者、德國將以破壞爲能事）云麥氏並謂此言意味深長、頃有人詢問麥唐納其所指之友人爲誰、麥氏答云、係指德國外長牛拉特而言、各方面談論麥氏演說、最爲一般所注意者、厥爲修改凡爾賽條約一問題、麥氏演說中、曾有兩次提及此節、第一次謂（和約自可修正、但不當在槍剌之下行之、而當在會議席次交换意見以修正之）、第二次又謂、（君等如眞欲寫成戰後歐洲新史一巻、則當力求適合歷史演進之自然程序、且當承認過渡時期係屬必要）云、一般人對於此兩叚演說之解釋、謂當指歐戰各項和約軍事條欵之修正而言、但有一部分人作不同之解釋、謂麥唐納至羅馬後將在其談話中擴大其主張至和約他項條欵云、今晨麥唐納曾與㨗克波蘭兩國外長會見、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>各國輿論一斑</p>
<p>倫敦　英相麥唐納之軍縮計畫、英報頗稱許之、但德報則冷淡視之、以其未有軍備平等之表示也、意報不置批評、惟聞意政府在原則贊成此計畫、尤贊成海軍辦法、美國雖對於某種細則不表同意、但輿論尙佳、紐約時報謂國務院已切實聲、法國對此計晝、尙無鮮明表示、法報指此爲十三個月第五十七次軍縮畫、但同時亦稱讚英相之好意、法國國家主義派之報紙則抨擊縮减陸軍之議、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>日使有吉明</p>
<p>預定月杪返國</p>
<p>與當局討論華北目前局勢　　日議員竟與軍閥沆瀣一氣</p>
<p>東京　駐華日使有吉明將於本月底返日、與國内當局討論張學良辭職後華北之局勢、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日國會上院今晨十時十七分開會、荒木陸相報告侵熱作戰經過、嗣後上院議員紛紛提出責問、謂侵熱初期、因湯不抵抗、作戰頗得順利、然此次攻長城各口、華軍積極抵抗、致日軍主要部隊損失奇重且連日傷亡甚衆、如不提早進攻華北、將來犧牲當不可預測、荒木陸相即答云、進攻華北與否、因事關外交軍機秘密、不能明白答覆、惟華軍再繼續侵占熱境、軍部已有相當準備、不得已時當即斷行必要之行動云、目前日軍部連日召開軍事會議、情緒殊形緊張、聞對華軍之估量與各種作戰、已陸續準備完妥云、（十七日華聨電）</p>
<p>卸任美駐英大使</p>
<p>偕同松岡赴美</p>
<p>倫敦　卸任美國駐英大使梅隆於今晨離倫敦、赴沙善墩、搭（列維亞散號）輪船以赴紐約、由美返日之日本代表松岡洋右同車出發、外部常務次長汪西泰爵士·比利時及波蘭駐英大使·意國駐英代辦·均赴車站送梅隆之行、日本駐英大使松平及駐比大使佐藤則到站送松岡之行、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約華僑</p>
<p>請美主持公道</p>
<p>南京　紐約華人土生會、前函美外部及新舊總統、要求執行非戰公約與九國條約、裁制日本在我國之暴行、刻美外部遠東股主任添明頓函復該會、略謂本部與白宫同日收到貴會議决案、要求依法解决中日糾紛、本部定當履行條約保持世界和平等語、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>法前總理赫禮歐</p>
<p>評日軍侵熱</p>
<p>暴日進攻早有籌劃　　世界和平感受威脅　　列强採一至行動</p>
<p>日内瓦　法前總理赫理歐近在愛克斯悉歐報、對於日侵熱河撰有專論、略謂日本之從新積極進攻、實使遠東之均勢變更、且將威脅世界和平、此事明係早有籌劃、北平安全問題、遲早且將發生、從法律點觀察、盟約第十六條之討論、殆甚難避免、戰爭狀態旣已存在、盟約自身亦已瀕於危殆、如果美俄拒絕協助、歐洲殆將無能爲力冷淡旁觀、實可使國聨蒙受嚴重之結果、帝國主義勝利、則自一九一八年以來之一切和平努力、均將悉成泡影、顧問委員會應設法决定調解是否仍屬可能、減少衝突、反對强權之復活、惟有世界之堅决一致、始能限制危險、列强之舉動參差要應設法避免云、（十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>日本退盟問題</p>
<p>樞府質問完畢</p>
<p>對政府外交失敗頗非難　　今日再開會議决定態度</p>
<p>東京　樞府審查委員會、本日開第二次會議對政府質問種種關於退出國聨後之方針、明日祇由樞府委員開會協議、委員會對此問題之態度、據聞委員會將於明日表明關於將來外交方針之希望、而承認原案、而由平沼副議長及二上書記官製作報告書、定於二十二日交正式會議、（十七日日聨電）</p>
<p>東京　樞府及政界之一部、以現内閣之對國聨外交、實有缺點、致於退出、不可謂非失敗、故頗有非難之詞、甚有主張内田外相之責任論者、政府將舉下列各點、反駁此等非難、在二十二日之樞府本會議、自然期待滿場一致通過退出之諮詢案、即一、日本正式承認滿洲國之獨立、簽字於日滿議定書即爲退出國聨之基因、國聨旣始終固執歐洲中心政治、日本之退出國聨、乃爲當然尤以决定、敵用規約第十五條四項、更不得不退、出換言之、旣採擇包含不承認滿洲國之勸告案、則從日滿議定書之精神保持上、不得不與國聨絕緣、一、日本雖退出、國聨然與國際協調之方針、並不變更、今後之日本外交、不煩國聨所謂中間機關之手、與列國分别直接交涉、更爲圓滿、故外交上毫無實害云云、（十七日電通電）</p>
<p>東京　日本退出國聨案、今日第二次在樞密院審議結果、實質上已决定正式退出、惟正式通告二十二日午前抑二十三日之中、齋藤首相與内田外長爲表示政府之態度、定二十一日相偕入宫覲日皇對退出國聨之經過、加以詳細之說明、同時在日内瓦以杉村博士名義、對國聨秘書長特魯蒙提出正式通告及退出國聨理由書、（十七日華聨電）</p>
<p>東京　今日樞密院稱、據政府之意見、以爲日本受委統治之南洋諸島、係日本領土之一部份、日本雖退出國聨、而國聨無權縱日本手中强攫以去、按凡爾賽和約規定以太平洋中赤道以北除甘姆島外、德國所有之加羅林、伯琉·馬利亞納·馬歇爾諸島、均委託日本統治、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>喜峯口一頁光榮戰史</p>
<p>我軍五百健兒壯烈殉國</p>
<p>敵軍一萬餘死大刀刃下</p>
<p>北平通信、日來喜峯口戰事、極爲激烈、我方大獲勝利、敵軍兩旅團約萬餘人、爲我宋哲元部包圍砍死、此投我前線士兵有極壯烈之犠牲、實爲民族增厚光榮、北平遼吉黑民衆後援會、前派赴喜峯口慰勞代表全紹武於十三晚返平、據談此投經過甚詳、爰記於次、</p>
<p>五百健兒壯烈犠牲　月之九日、萬福麟部由寬城、向喜峯口退却、敵軍在後緊緊追隨、乘我新軍未及接防之際、遂將喜峯口山佔據、復恃勝輕敵、十三上四兩旅團全數登山、所有軍械大砲亦均搬入山中、時我軍宋哲元部、尚在遵化、聞變立於九日晨傳令向喜峯口跑進路程計、一百五十里至下午四時已抵長城附近、各士兵遥見日軍在城上把守、無不激憤塡胸、立由前鋒部隊馮治安師挑選營精銳士兵、於傍晚時光、各持大刀、赤臂時進、爬登城上、立即拔刀砍殺、守城日軍因猝不及備、多不待還擊、即遭砍斃、移時守城之日軍一千人、已全數斃命、而我英勇殺敵之五百士兵、亦同時犠牲、生還者僅廿餘人、此一壯烈悲劇、實爲我民族爭得偉大光榮、彌令國人景仰也、</p>
<p>夜襲敵營斃敵數千　峯口會商進攻策略、於當夜十二時夜襲敵營、各軍伏身輕進、以極敏捷之速度、猛擊其第二道防綫、是夜斃敵千餘、我方亦有傷亡、十日上午九時、敵乃下令總攻、以重砲向我陣地猛轟、其轟擊方式與歐戰時無異、發彈之密與槍彈相若、當敵猛轟之時、我軍由原防綫向後撤退、伏地不動以待、逾三小時後、敵軍轟擊漸息、我軍乃急進至原防線、時方天色昏沉、黄沙樸面、我軍伏進距敵三四米逹地點、取密擊式猛烈襲擊、是役又斃敵千餘人、士氣大爲振奮、</p>
<p>激戰一夜將敵包圍　十日夜、我方再度夜襲、並派兩喜士兵、由左右繞過山峯進行包抄、是夜激戰最烈、敵措手不及、至十一日拂曉、我由左右分進之兩團、已在敵後路董家口合圍、於是大包圍之形勢完成、方圓二十里、爲我軍團團圍住、敵軍内部混亂、軍後所置大砲丨餘尊、均爲我軍奪獲、至十一日夜、敵軍砲隊完全爲我軍解决、敵方軍心頽廢異常、爭向各山間藏匿、我軍自十一夜起、連夜分派大刀隊搜索各山敵軍、俘虜中三分之二爲日軍、其餘除僞軍外、尚有鮮人雜於其間、迄十三日止、只有兩山尚未搜盡、其餘各山均已肅清、至所獲戰利品、爲數其多、詳細數目、尚須一二日始能查出、</p>
<p>戰勝原因貴在神速　此次喜峯口之戰、三晝夜間殲敵萬人、獲戰利品約值一千萬元、爲熱　發生以來之首次大捷、至能操勝原因要有三端、一行軍敏捷、該軍對於跑步操練最熟、臨陣來去神速、往往乘敵不備、逼進要害、加以猛擊、使敵迭受重創、二利用夜戰、蓋當夜戰時、敵之飛機坦克車諸種新式利器均不能資用、此正足補我軍備不足之缺點、再加以我軍行動敏捷、更可减少敵之戰鬥力、三大刀隊衝鋒、此爲我西北軍特種組織、而適爲專靠科學利器作戰之日軍所畏、當大刀隊衝鋒時、敵軍於數尺外、多有不及抵遇、立即身首異處、但此種衝鋒、必在其不意之時、此次我軍有此三項利點、益以士兵精神饒勇、决死抵敵、故於極短時期内、獲得大勝、</p>

<h3 id="c87">南洋郵資新率 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>定五月一日實行</p>
<p>中央社云、關於郵局擬改訂南洋批信郵資一事、據郵政總局某高級人員談話如下、</p>
<p>星埠郵資已加　據汕頭厦門郵局報告、南洋羣島及馬來聨邦寄來之批信、其郵資已由每封新加坡幣六分增至八分、當電詢吉隆坡郵政總局徵實、係自去年十月一日起施行、查我國與吉隆坡郵政對於批局往來南洋信件、均自民國十九年起、按照國際郵政資减半收費、現吉隆坡郵政、已由每封新加坡幣六分增至八分、計合其國際郵資（一角二分）三分之二、若就普通情形而論、我國自可同樣辦理、按照國際郵資（二角五分）三分之二收取國幣一角六分半、</p>
<p>我國仍收半費　但我國郵政爲體念僑艱起見、仍擬維持减半收費之原則、只按金法郎兌換價率改訂爲一角二分半、誠屬特别優待、</p>
<p>改資不增擔負　　據調查所得、南洋僑胞於匯欵之時、大都按當地郵資定率、預付回批（即復信）郵資、現時新加坡幣八分、約合國幣一角六分、已較我國擬改訂郵資一角二分半超過四分之一、故此項擬予改訂之郵資、實際上對於僑胞本身或其家屬、並不增重負擔與尋常加價逈不相同、</p>
<p>定期實行新率　郵局對於改訂資率、原擬儘速實行、但爲使各方明瞭眞相起鑡、不得不詳加解釋、遂致稽延時日、現郵局經濟日益短絀、而自熱省失陷以後、更感困難、此項改訂計劃、勢須實現、聞將通告於本年五月起、按照新資率徵收批信郵資、蓋十九年改訂批信資率之時、係在五月一日開始、故此次亦擬自五月一日起實行、比較新加坡郵政二次加費日期、又已延遲七個月之久、可見我國郵政對於批局、實屬異常優待矣、</p>

<p>何超民君與炎君來訊</p>
<p>簡略的說下子：就是一個丙男乙女相交二年，雙方家庭也都默認婚嫁的可能。最近乙女另愛丙男而置甲男於不顧。其所以移愛之故，當然伊覺得過去是錯誤，是盲目的。照理論上講：甲男旣知如此，最好是（拉倒。）因爲這種事根本不是勉强可以成功的。不道甲男見解不高，佔有慾極盛；乙女以家庭親友間，早已知道伊和甲男的關係，畏懼誹言，乃遂甲之願正式訂婚。可是中心十二分痛苦，仍不忘情於丙男也。說到丙男他是一個從千災百難苦辣酸甜中滾過來的，快三十歲的人了。對於伊的熱情當然接受。惟他不願令甲男難堪。所以他不但不鼓勇前進，反而努力替甲乙二人恢復舊有感情。同時他和乙女說（此後以兄妹相處，勿涉他念）不過乙女於不言中，似有不滿之意。先生；在這種情勢之下，乙女應當走那一條路？丙男應當走那一條路？</p>
<p>答：三角戀愛在記者想來，快樂恐怕不能抵償痛苦度而且我很希望你不要管這種閒事；足下在電報局天天聽不見熱河失陷，承德不守，平津危急，國破家亡的警耗麽？怎會還有這樣的興頭來討論這種問題？據我們看來，張三同她好也好；李四同她好也好；甲男同乙女好也好；丙男同乙女好也好。甲丙兩男都同她好也好，只要他們彼此無怨，各得其所，隨便那條路都好，還有什麽值得討論？此次熱河失陷，上海報上有人責備張學良，說他：（歌衫舞袖，聲色是娛），然而没有歌衫舞袖聲色是娛不爭氣的國民，又那得有此歌衫舞袖，聲色是娛的高級官吏？願足下三思猛醒！</p>
<p>我初來上悔時，由朋友的介紹，認識了幾個女同鄕。其中有兩位姓朱的，她們是姊妹，大朱和我同學，而且遠同選有課，所以我們接近的機會很多。在一學期後，我們已有很好的感情了。有一次，只是我和她在房間裏玩，她忽然提出了些關於戀愛方面的問題來和我討論，同時她又痛快的發揮她從未向我談過的戀愛的理論，當時我還不覺怎樣。後來我慢慢的察覺着她很有意思，而且以她最近的態度和行動上觀察，可斷定她是在向我示意，向我挑戰。我爲好奇心衝動，便微微的向她露出一種抵抗的態度，她是已有充分的準備，開弓引滿的等待着，果然一觸卽發了。以後我們的朋友感情上，便加上了愛的成分了。大約又過一學期的光景，我們的愛情雖已有了相當的程度，可是我總覺得有些不滿意她：一她太沉靜了，完全没有天眞爛漫的態度；二她的年齡比我大兩歲；（照生理上男女結婚的年齡，女的應比男的小）。在初時我都不覺怎樣，後來覺得處處感着苦悶，全未得着戀愛的樂趣。若需拒絶她，但她始終對我很好，我爲感情所難，又不忍拒絶。因我們的住址相距很近，她的妹到她那兒來玩時，我也常常會面的。她（小朱）是一個又天眞又活潑剛成年的處女，論漂亮當然勝於大朱，身體也很强健，惟學識和經騐不及乃姊耳。最初我本對她具有一種野心，後因和大朱生了那種關係，我才打消此意；但自我感覺和大朱不能進行時，我的舊念又起了，便决定轉過方針，向小朱進攻去。事很如意的，我一向她示意，她便表示接受。不過她已知我和大朱的關係，起初還疑我不是眞意，後經我屢次的解釋，才信服了我。這樣我和小朱又由朋友而生愛情了。此後我便微的向大朱表示冷淡，她莫明其妙，我又將我和小朱的關係告訴她，她氣極了，哭了兩天。但她仍不願和我破裂，反而責我用情不專。後來她便常常辱駡小朱，並申言若我和小朱成婚了，她定要呌父母斷絶小朱的經濟關係。（因他們的父母比較要愛大朱些，所以這話她能說得出也能做得到）。在我想來：我對大朱雖有些不滿，但她有時的確比較能够體人些，不過拒絶她要容易點，因我們的關係是她先向我挑戰而由我反抗所成的。但爲感情所難，又不忍拒絶。在小朱方面，下戰書也先是我，進攻也先是我，她旣受了我的愛，當然又不能對不起她，率性同她成婚吧。若是眞的斷了她的經濟又怎麽辦？我的經濟又不能供給兩人的需用。所以我眞是進退兩難。她們也感着極大的痛苦，而且姊妹間的感情一天惡劣一天。我不知怎樣辦的好。現在提出幾點，請先生務必有以敎我：一我對她們兩者都斷絶嗎？還是成就一面呢？二若採取後一問，又成就那一面？三成就一面後，對他方面又作如何對付？四成就一面後，萬一他方面不幸而演出慘劇，於法律上我是否應負何種責任？五對兩者都拒絶，於情於理是否說得去？拒絶後於我自身將如何處置？於她們將如何對付？</p>
<p>答：旣然同大朱發生戀愛，就不該又去進攻小朱，現在一隻脚踏上兩隻船，事齊乎？事楚乎？宜乎足下之左右做人難了。這種問題旁觀人不能代爲做答，最好是由你自己解决。然旣承下問，我們也就不得不略貢所見如下：一最好是兩者都拒絶，回過頭來做學問上的奮鬥，一個年紀輕輕的人，陷到情網裏，便會葬送你的一生。二旣不能一齊拒絶，必須於兩人中間，决定誰迎誰拒：若是爲你自身打算，還是舍小朱而取大朱。因爲大朱是她向你進攻，她又大你兩歲，她自然也曉得這種缺憾，因此她一定對你的情感更眞切，更可靠。她的沉靜寡言，並不是她的壞處，正是她的好處。天眞爛漫是好，然而惟其天眞爛漫，她也就易於動摇。（二者不可得兼），舍魚而取熊掌。）足下以爲然否？</p>

<p>不見人下樓</p>
<p>祇聽扶梯響，不見人下樓，這是我們蘇州人的二句土語，也正象徵着我們蘇州人的空頭。不料這二句話，到這年頭兒，大有移風易俗的功效，空頭主義，風行全球，空頭主義，千秋萬歲。</p>
<p>九一八之後，中國同日本，拉拉扯扯的扭到日内瓦。當時那位聨盟老爺，鬍鬚根根倒竪，把驚堂木拍得震天價響，說非制裁暴日不可。從此之後，一直到現在，日本人對聨盟老爺示一次威，聨盟老爺便也發一次威。可是聨盟老爺儘屢次的肝火上升，却兀是坐着不動。扶梯儘着響，人儘不下來。</p>
<p>一二八那一，十九路軍和第五軍抗日。日軍横一師團，竪一師團的調來，中國人於是日夕盻望各路救兵，早日開到，以禦强寇。所以聽說某軍已到蘇州，某軍已到無錫，雖然是防守在三十道四十道防綫之外，大家也興奮得百獸率舞，豈知這種消息儘着傳來，一直到華軍退到二十英里之外，站在最前綫和後方的軍隊，始終没有别個軍隊裏的露過一下臉。扶梯響得着實可以，始終如一，救兵没有。</p>
<p>國難，國難，到目下已一年有半，成日成夜的臥薪嘗膽，收復失地，到現在國難依然如大塊土地。究晚旣定的方針，是長的還是短的，始終没有露布過。扶梯聲響得活像有人走下來，可惜到底没走下一個人來。</p>
<p>祇聽扶梯響，不見人下樓，以後或許要成爲世界主義之一種，我蘇州空頭，與有榮焉。</p>

<p>在無線電播音事業發展的過程中，可以分做兩個時期，第一個是（廣告化（時期，第二個是（敎育化）時期；必須到了第二個時期，無線電對於民衆纔有眞正的價值，同時無線電本身纔有發達的現象。</p>
<p>目前，無線電的（廣告化）達於全盛的時間。收音機價目的低落使購置者普徧。在收音機所裝置者中，尤以商店最大多數。中等以上的商店丨丨尤其在都會的商店丨丨幾無不置此新式的裝璜品。當你走過熱閙的街道時候，除汽車電車聲外，從兩旁商店無綫電喇叭發出來的嘹喨的音樂會使你的耳震聾，有時也會使你停足一聽。無線電收音機本身就成爲最時髦的廣告工具。如果你自已置有一具收音機，你不妨從早晨到深夜繼續不停地靜聽各播音台發出來的節目。要是把你所聽到的）一記錄下來，你就發見一大堆的廣告。無論在什麽（彈詞），歌曲），（小調），甚至在皇皇然演說中，幾無一不含有廣告的成分。</p>
<p>這情形，在無線電事業幼稚的國家,尤其在無線電商業化的國家，是無法避免的。可是我相信，到了將來這情形必有終止的一天。將來，收音機價目格外低落，裝置者格外普徧：同時，播音台由（商業化）而趨於（民衆化）。那時候，播音的節目必隨着民衆意識的更新而大大改變。許多無謂的廣告意味的節目都消滅了，代之而興的乃是傳授知識的學科，與陶冶性情的娱樂。那時候，無線電事業就到了（敎育化）的時期，也就是到了有眞正價值的時期。</p>

<p>— 肖友</p>
<p>地線的耗阻，對於收音有重大的關係，這是誰都經騐得到的。普通接地線的方法，大都用一根鐵棒或銅棍，打入地中。這樣的接地，因爲操作容易，接線又可在地面上，而且可以深深打入地層深處，使永遠得到濕潤。所以非常便</p>
<p>利。</p>
<p>這種接地方法，若其鐵棒之長能夠達到地下的混層（ＭａｉｓｕｒｅＬｅｂｅｌ）那自然是最理想的。這個混層視各地方的地質而異，但大都在八九呎的深處。若揷入淺，則耗阻增加。</p>
<p>上圖便是表示接地棒之深與耗阻之關係。由此圖可知接地棒之深最少須爲四呎</p>
<p>此外接地棒的大小，面積，和其數目雖然也有關係，但並不十分重要。又棒數雖多，若其間隔不在三呎以上，則效果尤少。至四根以上，效率並不能再有增加了。</p>

<p>聽筒斷線，如斷在外面，可以用平常電燈用花線換接，没有什麽因難。但若内部的線圈斷線，</p>
<p>定此處斷線便不容易自行修理。現在有一個臨時救濟有方法。先察看内都是那一個線圈斷線，便把斷線的線圈兩端連結起來。因爲聽筒内線圈常有兩個。雖然一個斷線，還有一個仍然可以應用。如圖ＡＢＢＣ爲聽筒内部之二線圈。假定右方線圈内部斷線，那末只要照虚線所示，從其一端Ａ，至兩線圈連接之處Ｂ，用導線連結起來，就行。只不過聽起來聲音稍微减弱一些罷了。</p>

<p>— 振之</p>
<p>用一舊聽筒和若干留聲機上的零件，即可自製一電磁唱頭，以作試騐成音週率擴大器（ＡｕｄｉｏＡｍｐｌｉｆｅｒ）及調幅裝置（ＭｏｄｕｌａｔｏｒＳｙｓｔｅｍ）之用。</p>
<p>聽筒内部。可無需更動，只在背後開一小孔，以便用螺旋釘將其裝置在一可動的臂桿上。如圖，再以留聲機上之夫針（Ｓｔｙｌｕｓ）連接於聽筒之邊緣，而以其上端銲接於振動膜片（ＤＩＡＰｈ）ｒａｇｍ）之中央，聽筒内之電綫二端，則連接於擴音器。</p>
<p>安置唱頭的臂，是用一條很長的黄銅做成的。其與唱頭連接的螺旋不可太緊，以能使唱頭在旋盤上自由轉動爲度。在他一端的支柱，可用一黄銅管製成，而另用一螺絲釘揷入其中，使其固定在留聲機的底版上。</p>
<p>這種唱頭的週率性，略同普通的聽筒。因其廻阻（Ｌｉｎｐｅｄａｎｃｅ）極高，故最好直接用於第一個成音週率擴大管的栅極廻路中，或經過一普通放大變壓器亦可。（譯自ＯＳＴ）</p>

<p>（三）電子之流丨丨電流</p>
<p>我們日常所用的電燈，電話，電報，電爐等，没有一件不是利用電流。無線電波如上所述，也是藉電流的振動而發生的。那末，電流到底是什麽東西，我們先得弄個明白。</p>
<p>據最近科學家的研究，以間任何物質，只是兩件東西合成，一種呌做電子（Ｅｌｅｃｔｒｏｎ），一種呌做陽核（Ｎｕｃｌｅｒｓ），電子以各種不同的數目繞在陽核的外面，團團地轉。情形宛如地球，行星之繞太陽。因爲電子數目的不同，遂形式各種各樣的原子。任何分子或原子，都有一定的電子數。不能多一個或少一個。少了一個，牠　一定要用極大的力量來補充，多了一個，牠就不能安定，非把牠卸去不可。不論怎樣遠的地方，只要有路可通，牠們必定要很快的去連結一起，以有餘補不足。牠們流動的速度，幾乎和光線速度差不多。電流就是這樣形成的。</p>
<p>凡是物質多了電子，牠便發生一種特殊性，稱爲陰電性，也稱負電性；缺了電子。牠也發現一種特殊性呌做陽電性，也呌正電性。電子是世界上最小的東西，他的質量只有輕原子的一千八百餘分之一。牠常常多數存在於各種金屬之中。呌做自由電子。這種電子，都有負電性，平常自由來往於金屬體内，散漫無定。但是一過到帶有陽電性的東西，牠們就源源不絕的向那裏跑，去和牠結合。（電子自已互相排斥）結合以後，就不再起作用，這呌中和。所以我們要產生電流，就只要設法使金屬體内的電子活動就好。譬如接電壓於金屬線兩端，電子便向一定方向流動。而成電流。不過一般所稱電流的方向，和電子流動方向，剛正相反。說電流自由陽極流至陰電極的。凡金屬體等易於流通電流的物體，稱爲導體。</p>
<p>電流的大小，就是說電子或帶電分子（這種分子在學術上稱爲伊洪（Ｉｏｎ）流動的多少。這流動的多少，須視導體二端所需要的情形，及流動的難易而定。這也可譬之於水。試裝滿一瓶的水，瓶底開一孔，接以管子。水便從管中流出。如果瓶水甚高，則水流必急而大。這因爲水壓高，則水流大。又若所開之孔，或所接之管，直徑較大，則阻力减小，而水流增大。電流亦然，需要的情形，用電壓（Ｖｏｌｔａｇｅ）二字來說明。電壓高則電流會得加大。同時苦電流流動的阻力大，譬如導體用細線或其他不易通電之物質，則電流减小。這個名爲電阻（Ｒｅｓｉｓｔａｎｃｅ）</p>
<p>這電流電壓電流三者的關係，有歐姆（Ｏｈｍ）所定法則，可以規定。容在後</p>

<p>（二）陸用無線電之增加</p>
<p>設立於南羅特西亞塞利斯堡地方，</p>
<p>爲與英偷通訊的馬可尼放射站，其機器的構造甚爲特别爲便利實用起見，從前之發音機與收音機器須相離者，現則集合於一處。此種革新，大家認爲極經濟，而工作上又異常便利。</p>
<p>塞利斯堡放射站是爲發電帮之用如果將來需要時，亦可改爲海外的無線電話之用，也可以藉此二重廣播其祖國接收來的節目。</p>
<p>印度馬可尼放射站，現也擴大了，而且配置了馬可尼無線電話工具。這部機器使用者爲英印德律風公司。</p>
<p>在克奇的印度發音台，尙有一部馬可尼短波放射發音機。在唐特收音站，則有一短波收音機，以作與日本通訊之用。</p>
<p>歐洲互通電報的（帝國與國際通訊公司一之安加無線電台，在去年完全改組了。現在裝置了新式長波發音機，共有五，十，十五，二十基羅華脫電力的馬可尼機四部，爲與歐洲以外的國家，美國及其他國家無線電通訊之用的，則有一新式一一○基羅華脫電力的長波發音機，在安加使用的尙有一部四○基羅華脫短波的發音機這部短波發音機，實爲同類電機中之最優者，使用時雖有四種同時接送的電波，亦不致爲其所擾。　　在這一年中亞剌伯的通訊大有進步，在主要城市，已有很完全的無線電網之分佈，在亞剌伯，現已有十一個馬可尼固定電台，同時還有四個裝設於汽車之流通無線電台。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c175">我的自製單管機 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 家銘</p>
<p>我自已承認是一個不大想進取的無線電愛好者。現在大家都傾向於ＡＣ化，而我還是滯留於ＤＣ：現在大家都擴展至三管四管，而我還是拘泥於單管。我是日就落伍了，然而我也曾進化過哩：就是從不費電的礦石機進化到稍微費電的單管機。</p>
<p>我在（開洛公司播音）時代就好奇地弄了一個礦石機來玩，但是素性好動，不斷的自已拆弄，算是在研究；終於因爲僅僅是一個廣石機，不能饜足我的好奇慾，於是發心弄一個一管機。起初不曾弄出什麽成績，後來横拆弄竪拆弄，左改造右改造，幾年來孜孜於一管機，居然弄出一個自已認爲滿意的方式來。祇不過是自已覺得滿意罷了，至於方式合理與否！或者竟已經很陳舊，不值識者一顧，那就不得而知了。但值得誇口的是：製造易，經濟省，收程遠，聲音饗。</p>
<p>現在且把線路圖發表如下：</p>
<p>上圖的方式據說是來復式。即有高週率低週率的二次擴大。所用的材料是很普通的，如係初創，應先購備下列各件：</p>
<p>ＵＸ２０ｉＡ眞空管一隻Ｕｘ眞空管座一隻</p>
<p>·ＯＯＯ３５電容器二隻</p>
<p>２５電阻一隻</p>
<p>５：１方棚一隻</p>
<p>固定礦石（連架）一隻（我所用的爲Ｃａｂｏｒａｉｎｄｕｍ）</p>
<p>井２４雙紗包線一捲</p>
<p>接線柱四隻</p>
<p>６ＶＡ蓄電池一隻</p>
<p>９ｏＶＢ電池一隻</p>
<p>４·５ＶＣ電池一隻</p>
<p>三寸刻度盤二隻</p>
<p>蛛網線圈架（連板）一隻</p>
<p>接線三尺</p>
<p>４ｏｏｏ聽筒一隻（我所用的爲德律風根）</p>
<p>天線一百尺</p>
<p>地線用皮線四五十尺</p>
<p>膠木版一方</p>
<p>底板一方</p>
<p>圓頭螺釘若干隻</p>
<p>小森箱一隻</p>
<p>天線用絕緣子二隻</p>
<p>現在來告我的一管機的製法：</p>
<p>先用廿四號雙紗包線繞Ｌｉ六十圈在蛛網式線圈架上，再在同板Ｌｉ線圈之外加繞Ｌ二十圈，那個再生圈１２繞在另一蛛網板上，亦冰十圈，然後依上二圖所示，按圖接線。接線以愈短愈好，排列以整齊美觀爲上。</p>
<p>各部接線完全妥貼以後，應先檢查線路有無錯接，尤應注意ＡＢ電的誤接，如果完全無誤，擔保成績佳良。因爲本機以礦石檢波·以２ｏ１Ａ放大，是再合適不過的。</p>
<p>不過，或者因爲地位與接線等手續微有出入而致收音效率減低（或者竟加强也難說，）則應在裝製者的面面顧到。如嫌收程不遠，檢波不敏，或收音蕪雜，則可使天線加高或減短，或在天線回線中加一隻·１ｏｏｏｏ的可變電容器；如再生力過强，可將Ｌｘ１２兩線圈離得很遠。這些自應依從一般的法則。</p>
<p>這機後來我又把Ａ電池改用交流，雖然成績比直流差些，但却省了充電等許多麻煩，容我在下次有機會時再談吧。</p>

<h3 id="c193">說宣傳文字 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>文　字的宣傳，在中國一向就把　的効力看得很大。讀檄可以愈頭風，傳檄可以定江南，上馬殺賊下馬作露布者便是文武的全材，律尖兒一掃，更能夠掃去五千人。到了現代，這文字宣傳的用途，尤其廣了；專賣日貨的店門上會貼起誓不買賣仇貨的傳單，在撕揭廣告紙做衣服的乞兒身上，也掛起了航空救國的大字。并且在不久之前，熱河曾打了許多次的勝仗，當九一八以後，義勇軍殺敵，也不知殺死了幾萬。</p>
<p>幾日來局面變了，報紙上連縮短陣線，誘敵深入等文字都覺得陳腐了，於是乎就變成了聲明。則曰，外間所傳之直接交涉；並無其事：再則曰，日宣若侵入長城以南，我軍必誓死抵抗，責任應歸日負。甚而至於遠處在西南的粤省，也下了屯糧禦侮的命令，上海的碼頭工人日發了迎汪救國的宣言。</p>
<p>這些原都是很好的宣傳文字，大之可以鎭壓人心，小之也可以虚張聲勢。但聲勢虚張得太盛，落後也有變成不能自圓其說的危險；日本人有一句諺語，呌作（笛聲徹天，踊者不前，）日文報上每以這一句話來嘲笑我們，事實上我們却也着實有點被嘲的資格。可是我們的祖先，也有些遠見，他們早就看到了這些由他們創造出來的文字宣傳，將來一定要變成童叟無欺的空心招牌，所以又爲我們留下了一句後脚，呌作（有文事者必有武備）。有文事者必有武備！我再在這裏重言一句，好敎日本軍人不要太看輕了我們，只管殺進城來。</p>

<p>— 曉風</p>
<p>今　日身體略微感得不適意，早上趟在床上看了自由談，依舊昏昏睡去。死友　　忽來託夢，說他剛纔遇見柳宗元（柳宗元爲什麽此時還不投生轉也？這我不能解釋，須得請敎吃十年長素一心禮佛的胡懷琛先生），宗元很氣，說胡懷琛（任意）塗改他的文章，（有損個人的名譽，必須要求更正與道歉）。附來一信，托他轉托我介紹到自由談去發表，俾得援例（將此信登出，並自動更正，道歉。）死人也要和活人纒帳，實在麻煩！但旣受托，不能不將信錄出寄去，登不登還隨編者的例。原信如下：</p>
<p>自由談編輯黎烈文先生鑒：今見三月十六日自由談所載（來函照登，一知道胡懷琛自以爲自已所做文章，威嚴十足，不許别人評議。若有評議，必須自動更正道歉。如果實行此例，則他對人似也應該照樣辦理。刻查拙著（柳州山水近治可遊者記，）其中（石魚之山全石，無大草木，山小而高，其形如立魚，在多秭歸西）一句。他竟不說理由，妄行塗改。把我原有的一個（在）字用方括弧勾去，又把（西）字斷屬下句。（見商務印書館出版（學生國學叢書）（柳宗元文一九十四頁。）任意塗改，弄得我的文章上下不貫。又同書七十六頁，（遊黄渗溪記）的一篇文中，我因爲前面已說黄神祠，下面接叙黄神祠之上，即將（祠一字省去，戰寫（黄神，）說：（黄神之上，揭水八十步，···。）他也把（黄神）二字妄加譏笑，說（神字疑是祠字之誤。）似此任意譏笑，塗改，我現在認爲有援例（要求更正及道歉的必要。）簡單的說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）我的第一句，照現在時髦的說法便是借產物代產地。這種筆法古人常用，而（山海經一的海外經中更爲常用。本句即仿（山海經）的筆法，以（多秭歸）三字代上文說過的多秭歸的仙弈山。他聲聲口口說我學（山海經，）却不（細細去查（山海經）有無此無此種筆法，任意把它塗改，而且任意加按，說（此句多秭歸謂石魚之山多秭歸也。）而且故意編入（學生國學叢書，）對學生界廣爲宣傳　認爲有損個人的名譽，必須要求更正與道歉。</p>
<p>（二）我的第二句，也係一種常用的省略法。實例一時記不起許多，只記得近讀一本談我界情形的書上便有這麽一　：</p>
<p>裘文達公賜第，在宣武門石虎　　：文達之前：爲右翼宗學：宗學之前，爲吳額駙府：吳額駙之前，爲前明大學士周延儒第。</p>
<p>這書便是清朝紀昀著的（閱微草堂筆記。一所引一句見（如是我聞）四。句中凡二度作如我的省略：一爲（文達之前）的（文達）後省（第一字，一爲（吳額駙之前）的（吳額駙）後省（府）字。他對於我的此種省略，也任意譏議，在學生界宣傳。我認爲也有損個人的名譽，必須要求更正與道歉。</p>
<p>（三）我的此種要求，係循例提出，並非故意鬼混。請將此信登出，使他不要以爲死無對證，便可任意瞎說。</p>

<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>朱　先生以說笑的口氣去掩他的慚作。</p>
<p>公共汽車來了。海泉和朱渭道先生一同上了車，共佔了一張椅位。</p>
<p>（你也到學校襄去？）</p>
<p>（不。我要請幾天假。）</p>
<p>（爲什麽？）</p>
<p>我的老祖父死了。）</p>
<p>海泉隨便扯了這句謊，其實他的祖父已經死了七八年了。</p>
<p>（Ｏｈ，Ｉａｍｓｏｒｒｙ····）</p>
<p>朱先生說了這句英文，却引起了海泉的反感。他想，朱先生又没有在花旗或紅毛走過，也這樣俏皮地說起英國話來，幹嗎？充其量，只是南京某敎會學校的英文專修科畢業生吧了。（那你不是要回去？）</p>
<p>（不回去。）</p>
<p>海泉摇了摇頭。</p>
<p>（密司脫林，你如果不回去，那還是上課好。人，誰···不死！你的祖父今年多少歲數了？）</p>
<p>（大約有七十一二歲了吧。）</p>
<p>（那也差不多了吧···）</p>
<p>海泉看見朱先生儘在點頭的神氣，非常可笑，想笑了，但忙忍住。</p>
<p>（密司脫林，你聽見學校裏有什麽消息没有？）</p>
<p>過了一怱，朱渭道怱然還樣地問海泉。</p>
<p>（（没有呀。）</p>
<p>海泉也有點驚奇了，凝視了一下朱敎授的臉孔。他看見朱先生的左眼角上還垂着一粒黄色的，介于固態和液態之間的目糞。他便想，朱先生的臉都還没有揩乾凈，也佩說（Ｉａｍｓｏｉ）ｒｒｙ麽？</p>
<p>（密司脫林，你要帮我一下忙啊。）</p>

<p>什　麽呌做和原韻？我問學校裘一位敎國文的老先生。</p>
<p>（人用遇的韻脚，你拿來做你的韻脚，也作（首，這就呌和韻）老先生說了。</p>
<p>（那麽，假使他不單只拿别人的脚，甚至於拿了别人的半身丨）我的話還没有說完。</p>
<p>（他是不是想變成那個人呢？）老先生問。</p>
<p>（不是，他是想把那個人，變成他自已。）</p>
<p>（我是說，假若他不只用一　韻脚，而且用了兩個三個字的時候，主張這種是和原韻，這對不對呢？）我又問。</p>
<p>（這樣的主張。）老先生舊事動提，他感慨地說了。（在以前考秀才的時候，要受罰的。）（怎樣個罰。）</p>
<p>（在當時像這種主張的秀才，我們就拿他考四等，罰他挑紅糞桶丨卽呌他師養的意思。）</p>
<p>（呀，這位先生，正是學農的，而且我想他大約在學校裏，也考的是四等。）</p>
<p>（哦，而今什麽都倒行逆施了，）老先生嘆息了一陣。</p>
<p>可是這却替我解决了一個問題。農科大學生伯雨先生在某小報裏，說章某的兩首詞，每句用了别人的三四個字，是和原韻。並且說（但他的詞，我是佩服的，他的詞有一種新鮮的熱烈情感···）這個，不是先聞了糞桶，不會這麽不辦香臭的，</p>

<p>蘇州小住日記之二</p>
<p>蘇州多···？（蘇州多美人！）</p>
<p>却不這樣想。（上海的美人就比蘇州多。）蘇州最多的是棺村店·大街小巷，觸目都是。蘇州城外曠野，隨處有蘇州保墓會的新石碑：墓旣可保，則棺材店當多開，亦應有之邏輯。保墓會會長，據說是著有聲望的（彭鄕紳）；若由他來兼任棺材店老板那更（人地相宜）。喝杯清茶，閑談幾句，把餘生這樣排遣過去，蘇州人似不戀戀於人間世。獨於棺材，杉木不足，繼之以楠木；楠木不足，繼之以沉香木。於墳墓，土堆不足，繼之以石廓；石廓不足，繼之以保墓會。大　喝清茶談閑天的風味。倒使我有些不懂起來。有人說：在蘇州作寓公的，大都是殘年風濁的老頭子。有生之日無多，把蘇州當作大墳墓，處處作下世安排。這倒說得近眞。不過曠野終是曠野，陂陀起伏，尺把來高；其中棺木化爲糞土，屍骨化爲蟲沙，還得靠彭鄕紳的力量纔能免於淪爲平地；若用喝清茶談閑天的哲學理解一番，則棺材店不必開，保墓會不必設，彭鄕紳也覺得一切都是多事的了。可惜這些話，郷對不能與蘇州人說。</p>
<p>蘇州的街巷，一望都是黑牆頭；以黑色象徵死亡，這色彩和棺材店頗相調和。我一看到黑牆頭，就想起我自已是走進墳墓來了。那時我正在讀蘇俄五年計劃的各種記載；蘇俄把木材看得非常寳貴，用以燒火，即算糟塌了好材料。而我自已却住在設計把獨幅杉木埋在地下讓牠腐爛的老板圈子中，眞所謂（與鬼爲鄰）！聽　，蘇白來哉：</p>

<h3 id="c262">中國不亡之又一鐵證 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>前幾天有（僞帝親貴）愛國，近日又有（廣州）著名交際花陳女士，以色相救國一事，</p>
<p>不成問題，當這國難方殷，國亡無日的當中，只要是中國的國民，誰都有救國之職責，（僞帝視貴）旣然不能例外，那末（交際花）救國，當亦在情理之中。何况（以弱女子不克效命疆塲），當然，自非以（以美姿容買獻國家不可。由此可知，救國之道不一，（玉容）（色相）亦大有奇效。</p>
<p>不過，在這裏我們却有了極有價值之發見，有多少少年英俊的公子哥兒們，雖然不一定以國家爲身外物而追逐於歌塲舞榭之中，可是在大好情塲，却不可不拚命馳驅，雖千金買笑，亦在所不惜，何况僅以十元之捐欵，便有金屋藏嬌之（若干希望）。而且，旣得美人之青睞，復收救國之成效。是以。他們畢竟都是可兒，中國苟得不亡，當然。他們皆有天大的功勞了。同時，我們在此更可明白的了解，爲了爭取中華民族光明的出路，絕不必以廣大的勤勞羣衆擔當重大的責任，因爲旣有多少大人物在磕頭打躬於（主持正義）保障和平）的（戰神）之前，更有這一羣努力救亡而不惜拜倒石榴裙下的公子哥兒在寄愛國於愛神之中，假如中國仍是必亡，眞是太無天理了。</p>
<p>至於交際花陳瑞華小姐之愛國於情書色相之中，更是增加我民族絕大的光榮。臂如在第一次世界大戰之中，德國曾有若干女間牒不惜以色相而剌探敵情，即就八國聨軍打到北京的時候，我國亦有妓女救國之外史，所以美人救國，代有名人，自不必傚法木蘭而轉戰於塞外胡茄與戰馬悲嗚聲中，而於愛情泛溢與香檳酒芬芳沉醉之時，亦可盡婦女救國之責。比之於繡詩詞於戰士的小衫上的巾幗英雄們，豈可同日而語？</p>
<p>旣如此，像這樣的美人美事，當然值得載諸史帛，以昭不朽，不過在此國難史還未着手編撰之前，我們爲文記之，當然也是功德無量。何况這還是中國不亡之鐵證，從此，憂國憂時的愛國志士，更得以高得以高枕無憂了。</p>

<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>自從承德失陷的消息傳到我們校裏後，我們校裏抗日救國空氣又突然緊張了；自稱愛國健將陳，奔走呼號，極形忙碌，跳舞博士同，已有幾天不到　　宫去了，好像覺悟跳無究意不能救國：政治派Ｂ先生，也大發其救國妙論，學生會，　　同志會，無不努力進行抗日工作，照情形看來，我們學校裏，没有一個人不在幹抗日抗日救國的工作。</p>
<p>昨天早上，陳邀我去參加他們的募　隊，當然養不容亂。進過早點跟着他們到霞飛路上，沿途挨戶勸募過去，到環能路口，迎面來了一對洋裝動物，手　着桃臉杏唇的一位摩登小姐，我們看見他們，　多麽歡迎之至！就下了一道緊急動員令，把他們重重包圍，伸着手同乞丐一樣要令，把他們重重包圍，伸着手可嘆！本來在我們理想，以爲一定可以博到他們同情，捐助點錢，但事實往往出人意外，他們非但一錢不名，反而，架全絲邊眼鏡的一個，駡我們說：（不要臉的東西，要我們錢，且慢！且慢！我們聽了這話，眞是冒火，他們看我們是什麽人，可恨可嘆！</p>
<p>吃過午飯，向靜安寺路進發，到麥特赫司脫路口姓吕的那一家，又使我們淘氣了，照理：（我們踏進門，先說幾句恭維話，然後再把什麽義勇軍　　軍如何忠勇殺敵！什麽救國就是救自身！什麽捐助軍餉比唸佛燒香來得好，諸如此類的話，喝道一番之後，再喊幾聲公公婆婆，請你慷慨解　，共襄善譽，一我們把上面一段話，說了一遍，二遍，但是他們看見我們好像是什麽似的，不作聲亦不回答，經我們喊了十次以上）公公婆婆），他們才顯出老成的神氣，對我們說：</p>
<p>你們這種學生，眞是不要自好，不肯用功讀書，歡喜做這種事情，）（現在旣到此地，拿二角錢去）說後，從袋中掬出二角小洋交給我們，我們没有辦法只好在他們卑視的眼光中，倖悻地出來。</p>

<p>嘿哈，嘸啥道理格；走得加快呀？社交公開，搿朋友也好格！</p>
<p>開房間去。</p>
<p>時間是黄昏。從東方將吐出灰青色的刹那，馬路上一羣一陣的女工們個個都擠這偌大而偉嚴的工廠去，是的，爲道飢餓的驅策，環境的支配！有些乘着獨輪車在黑暗的濃霧中彳亍行着，還有些離廠遥遠的；連乘獨輪車亦不可得，由是她們的苦痛程度槪可想見。充當牛馬生活的工人們，現在十二小時的工作已經完畢放工了！她，走走向她的目的地家去，打了幾下深長的呵欠，顯然的精神是極度疲乏了，但是當她每天放工回家的辰光，老是有人同她纒繞不清，一個白脸小胖子釘她的梢，希冀吃她的一塊肉！自然，今天不會例外，他又在她背後左右，忽急忽緩，嘻皮笑臉的亦步亦趨的追逐着。</p>
<p>因爲她家離廠遥遠的緣故，每每小胖子釘了她百二十步路，結果只有享受她冷剌剌的倒白眼而已</p>

<p>工廠的氣笛鳴嗚，由這聲音裏湧出了一羣羣的身體極度疲倦的女工來。於是白臉小胖子又要開始做他的日常功課丨丨釘梢了。</p>
<p>（喂，姑娘。今天邪氣格冷，一個仔睏覺阿要冷？好啦，開房間去白相相。）</p>
<p>（老子，儂認識嗎？漂亮些！）她的遠遠避着的丈夫走近小胖子面前說。這僅是警告他，伊是有夫之婦，蝦蟆休想天鵝肉之意。</p>
<p>（丢那媽。好，認的你，怎辦？）這時小胖子老羞成怒了，惡狠狠的反問題。</p>
<p>（豈有此理，我的女人儂竟敢調戲伊？）</p>
<p>（儂的女人？嘿！）</p>
<p>（　道你却不信嗎？當眞你還要釘梢）嗎？混蛋！</p>
<p>（放屁！）</p>
<p>（唔！）</p>
<p>（打，大家來，打隻猪玀。）</p>
<p>（傷了，可傷了丨她呌。忽地西邊奔來了幾個同夥的漢子，一起帮同着拳脚交加的向她丈夫毒打，雖則他誓死拚命掙扎，終是敵不過他們的，不一刻，竟至失了知覺似的不能動彈，倒在地上！她驚駭的嚶嚶亂嚷嚷：（謝謝！哎啊，眞個將要閙出人命來哩，停下吧！停下。）</p>

<p>— 萍</p>
<p>近黄昏時候，刮起一陣風，門前通市鎭去的小路上，儘是飛舞着的灰沙。鄰居人家的小孩，四出招呼他們的家畜。在這小村上，養家畜是他們唯一的職業，每家人家，有百頭十隻鷄鴨，是普通的事。他們一年四季的衣食父母，就在家畜的身上，所以他們提防家畜，是第一件大大的事。如其附近發見了有黄鼠狼的蹤，他們更日夜提訑着。</p>
<p>振民坐在門前的石級上，正想着去年的事</p>
<p>下雪的一天，爸·媽·自已三個人，爲了黄昏時失落了一隻鷄，四出找尋，後來在河浜邊發現那隻鷄淹死在水中。爸提起牠僵硬的腿笑着說：（一頓好酒。）</p>
<p>李振民家是本村中家畜最一家，生活當然也比普通人家舒適一點。他的爸喜歡喝一口酒，每天晚上，夫妻三個，園着一桌吃飯，他老人家鼙着酒杯，閒談從市鎭上小茶館中聽來的野話，妻和兒子，往往聽出了神。於是老頭子調皮地說：（明天不講，要講殺一個鷄來下酒）。照例，在這村上，吃鷄鴨是並不希奇的事，但是李振民的媽，是個喜歡茹素唸佛的人，她說：（我們一家靠着牠們過活命，還要殺來自已吃，阿彌陀佛的！老頭子撚着鬍子說：（賣給人家，也是一刀一個頭。（那是人家當的罪過一！這是老媽子唸佛的理由。於是老頭子無可奈何地說（煑兩個鷄子罷，我做好事，免得將來一刀一個頭。）李振民這時不由得也大笑起來。但是老媽子還是莊嚴的說：（做好事纔有好報的丨所以老頭子發見了淹死的鷄笑着說：（一頓好酒：）</p>
<p>李振民坐在門前的石級上，想着去年的事：</p>
<p>吃鷄的下三天，爸受了酒寒，臥床不起，發燥，囈語，媽還打趣說：（貪吃鷄，天老爺罰你生二天病。鄕下人本來對於發寒熱的病，視爲便家常便飯，吃一點薑糖湯之類，就會好的。然面爸的病，却不見起色，每天加重，媽才發了急，到市錢上去請有名的郎中。郎中說寒入脾胃，開出來的藥方，都是很貴的價錢，爸生了三個月的病，媽瘦得不成模樣，所有鷄鴨，因爲在寒裏，要錢用祇有賤價賣出去，但是爸終於一病不起。</p>
<p>他見着鄰居的小孩，在灰土中招呼他們的家畜，他不由流起淚來。他的媽在屋裏喊他進去吃飯，他拭拭涙，見桌上放着二碗粥湯。媽問他爲什麽眼睛紅紅的，他推說吹進了沙屑。母子二人胡亂吃了飯，就跑上床去睡覺，振民暗想今天還有粥湯喝，明天吃什麽呢，聽見媽在床上翻身，他就想定了一個注意，兩眼望着帳頂等媽的鼾聲。</p>
<p>附近村上忽然一陣犬的狂吠，老媽子從睡夢中醒來，大門已有撞門的聲音，喊她的兒子，却不見答應，隱約門外閙着：（老太婆，你出來，你的兒子做了</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一件困難的事情，請先生費神代爲解答，不勝感謝。事實是這樣的，我在十一歲的時候，父親就見背了；賴我的舅父敎養，並與表兄同學。我有二個表姊，第二個表姊，她對於我感情很好，我住在她家裏的時候，服侍我亦很週到。凡是我的衣服，都是她洗的做的：有空的時候，說說笑笑，到是很快樂的。光陰遇得很快，轉瞬我已經有十七歲了，便託親友薦到本埠一家紗線號學業：迄今已有五年。在這五年之中，我是常常到她家裏去的，我們不致於十分膈膜。前年九月。舅母向我提議，願意將二表姊許婚給我，並囑我努力學業，績蓄金錢，以備將來結婚之需。我那時因爲年紀尙小，並且未知表姊的意思，究竟什樣，故本即時應允。另有一個原因，便是我自已曉得我是一個家無恒產，没有多大能力可以服務社會，藉以取得報酬，來贍養家室。即使結了婚，亦没有幸福可言，倒及陷害了二表姊。現在我有一個機會，探得表姊的意思：她說她情願嫁給我的；並且她說她父親有點不大願意，然而有她及她的母親的意思，母舅亦没有法子了。在三年前，曾經有一個美國的留學生，是舅父朋友的兒子，舅父很有意思，將二表姊嫁給他，然而我的表姊不願意。她說情願同我吃苦，不情願同他享樂。這是她現在方始告訴我的，表明她的心跡。先生，我現在已經有二十一歲了，但還是一個商店裏的小職員，月薪大洋五元；在最近的將來，是萬難組織家庭的。然而她却口口聲聲說願意嫁給我，我曾經造訴她，我非至經濟能力足以組織家庭時，是不能同你結婚的，她說她願意等我的，我勸她另外尋一個如意夫君，她說（死也情願的，要我另外嫁入，是萬萬辦不到的。先生，我現在把事實，統統告訴你了，願你把下列的問題解答我。</p>
<p>（一）用怎梯的法子，勸她另外嫁人？</p>
<p>（二）假使她執意不肯時，我將怎樣對待她？因爲我最近的將來，没有能力能夠瞻養家室，並且亦不願意她虚度那寳貴的青春。</p>
<p>（三）我同她有血統關係，法律雖無表姊弟禁止結婚的明文，然而我想將來生產出來的小兒，不無因父母血統的關係，生理上受點影響，未知先生以爲然否？</p>
<p>以上三個題，請先生詳爲解答，不勝盼禱之至：即頌</p>
<p>文安　　沈世昌鞠躬</p>
<p>編者按：趙君的表姊，因爲從小與趙君一塊兒長大，她對於趙君的一切當然有準確的認識。從她肯矢志嫁他的一層看來，趙君必定有過人之處；所以她才肯吃些眼前的苦呢。這位女士的眼力，我們從她不慕虚榮，不肯嫁給一位留學生而可知。我們看到大一半的留學生，他們的眼界，到過外國，當然很高，你至少除非是一個大學生，才有資格去做也的夫人。趙君的母舅，還在那裏一想情願，正眞可憐。所以趙君的母舅，雖說有點反對，可以不成問題。何况照來信看來，你的舅母表姊，似乎還可左右你的舅父呢！至於現在的進欵，不夠組織家庭：好在你的表姊，願意等呢。古人說（男子三十而娶），趙君現在是二十一歲，再等九年，也不可爲過遲；在這九年當中，憑了一身的努力，成功是不難的。因爲你的表姊年歲比你大，</p>

<p>MacDonald Explains New Disarmament Plan</p>
<p>Firstly, Treat Germany with Freedom and Fairness</p>
<p>Equality in Armaments Cannot Be Achieved Overnight</p>
<p>Proposing a Five-Year Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>Seeking to Build a Foundation for World Peace</p>
<p>Geneva - British Prime Minister MacDonald, today at the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, put forward the most forthright and stern plan that has ever been seen. He declared that the current methods of the Disarmament Conference have reached their limit in effectiveness. If we sincerely desire to achieve real success in reducing armaments, we must take bold and progressive steps. Before presenting the British plan, Mr. MacDonald displayed his eloquent talents, making a pointedly sharp move, implicitly pointing out the attitudes of Germany and France as major obstacles to world coordination. He said that recent actions and speeches have not helped the difficult work of the conference, clearly referring to the fervent nationalism of the German Hitler government. He also stated that Germany must be given freedom and fairness, but (contributions) must come from both sides, and both sides should (contribute) to world peace, disarmament, and trust. He also warned those present that international conferences not only allow for equality in armaments but also stipulate that the armed forces held by a country must never be used to resolve disputes, and that equality must be achieved gradually, not overnight, etc., all of which were clearly directed at Germany. In addition, he stated that the problem of peace is entirely psychological. If an atmosphere is not created in which doubts cannot arise, then doubts will never be dispelled, which also seemed to be directed at Germany and France.</p>
<p>It is reported that before the General Commission meeting today, news of British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech spread, and people rushed to listen. Within minutes, the vast auditorium's gallery was filled, and those who arrived later had almost no room to stand.</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald first stated that the British plan requests a conference of naval powers to be convened in 1935. He also said that you may feel that what is being asked of you this time is too risky, so please study this plan first, and then propose amendments.</p>
<p>Proposing a Five-Year Convention</p>
<p>The British plan has five major features: (1) a duration of five years; (2) reduction of armaments rather than rearmament; (3) international management of armaments; (4) the first time to determine concrete numbers; (5) the establishment of an agency to prepare for further disarmament.</p>
<p>Universal Reduction of European Land Forces</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald continued that the British plan proposes that the land forces of all European countries, after meeting the standards proposed in the French plan, should be universally reduced by one-third.</p>
<p>Regarding the convening of a conference of naval powers in 1935, Mr. MacDonald stated that if previous naval treaties were still not common, then it is not our fault.</p>
<p>Abolish Military Aviation</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald then announced that the plan proposed that if a method could be found to ensure that commercial aircraft are not converted for military use, then land and naval military aviation should be completely abolished.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. MacDonald stated that if this effort fails again, then the progress of events will quickly plunge you into a major disaster. After failure, the feeling of war will inevitably increase. Are our hatred of war and the use of force to resolve disputes not enough?</p>
<p>Outline of the British Plan</p>
<p>As for the outline of the British plan:</p>
<p>Stop Building New Ships (1) Completely stop building all battleships until 1935, except that Italy may build one, and France has already laid the keel of the Dunkerque-class cruiser since the Disarmament Conference opened. (2) At the same time, stop building 8-inch gun cruisers, except as stipulated in the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>Abolish Unequal Clauses (3) Abolish the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that restrict the German Navy, but the German Navy must in fact maintain its current status until the end of 1936. Limit Cannon Caliber (4) Mobile land cannons will in the future be limited to a maximum caliber of no more than 105 mm, but existing cannons may be retained up to 155 mm. Coastal defense guns are limited to 406 mm. (5) Limit tanks to no more than 16 tons.</p>
<p>Prohibit Aerial Bombardment (6) Completely prohibit aerial bombardment and stipulate that land, sea, and air vehicles shall not exceed three tons in the air (unloaded weight). The airpower of major countries, including Britain, France, Japan, Italy, the Soviet Union, Russia, and the United States, is the same, limited to 500 land and sea aircraft. (7) Prohibit chemical, poisonous, and incendiary warfare. (8) Only limit the establishment of a permanent disarmament commission for land forces in European countries. The convention replaces the clauses in the Disarmament Treaty restricting Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Stipulate the number of troops in each country (9) The proposed troop strength of each country: France 400,000, Italy 250,000, Germany 200,000, Poland 200,000, Romania 100,000. (10) Half of France's 400,000 troops must be stationed in the country, while Italy's 200,000 troops will have 200,000 stationed domestically and 50,000 stationed overseas. The troop levels for Poland and the Soviet Union include those stationed both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Eliminating War Methods The British plan is presented in the form of a convention. Its first chapter discusses the issue of national security, based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and declares that if a war breaks out in violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then if any of the five major powers request a meeting, all parties concerned should hold a meeting and agree to take steps sufficient to determine which party is responsible for the breach.</p>
<p>Praise from All Sides</p>
<p>After Mr. MacDonald finished his speech, French Prime Minister Daladier immediately praised the noble aspirations in Mr. MacDonald's plan and promised to study it with sympathy. U.S. Representative Gibson said that Mr. MacDonald's proposal could advance disarmament by a major step, but declared that the U.S. government, in view of the great importance of this convention, should not consider it hastily, so the U.S. representative is not prepared to discuss it immediately, and praised Mr. MacDonald's spirit of harmony. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister's Trip to Rome</p>
<p>Geneva - French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour will depart for Paris at 2:00 PM tomorrow. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will also depart for Rome at the same time. The French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister intend to visit London soon in return for the British authorities' personal visit to France. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The National Socialist Party's (Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung) commented on British Prime Minister MacDonald's trip to Rome, saying that (the actions that the British Prime Minister's trip can produce are only actions between the countries responsible for guaranteeing the Locarno Treaty). The newspaper also said that Italy advocates postponing the Disarmament Conference, and the British advocate a temporary solution to the disarmament issue. It is not known whether this approach is a compromise solution that is harmful to Germany. (Note: The countries referred to in this telegram as being responsible for guaranteeing the Locarno Treaty refer to Britain and Italy.) (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Italian newspapers, upon hearing the news that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will visit Rome, have expressed their welcome with enthusiastic rhetoric. British political and legal figures did not ask Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to meet in a city in northern Italy but personally visited Rome, demonstrating their eagerness to solicit Italy's opinions. Moreover, this meeting is taking place after Mr. MacDonald made a proposal at the Disarmament Conference, which Italy is particularly pleased with, as it allows politicians from both countries to discuss the overall situation and thoroughly examine the reactions of various countries to this proposal. The Roman Telegraph, which has always published official opinions, now confirms that the discussions at this meeting will focus on disarmament, but also states that the causes of international conflicts will of course also be considered. Diplomatic circles now believe that the situation in Germany will also be on the list of issues to be discussed, as the situation has changed since Hitler came to power. Mr. MacDonald may ask Mussolini to use his influence to advise Hitler not to act rashly, lest he precipitate events in Europe. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>The United States Expresses Support</p>
<p>Davis Appointed Official Disarmament Representative</p>
<p>New York - According to Washington news in New York newspapers, the United States is preparing to support British disarmament proposals in order to eliminate concerns about war and establish economic coordination in Europe. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>The State Department in Washington today stated that the U.S. government will do everything in its power to avoid the failure of the Disarmament Conference, and therefore sent Davis to Geneva with the rank of ambassador to serve as the chief representative of the United States. It is reported that Secretary of State Stimson is willing to fully cooperate with any reasonable plan to reduce armaments and alleviate the tax burden. Although the current government wants to achieve the most satisfactory reduction, it does not necessarily have to insist on the Republican Party's proposal to reduce by one-third. It is heard that after Davis arrives in Geneva, he will strongly urge countries to immediately make practical reductions. It is not yet known whether President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull intend to make new proposals. Mr. Davis is currently planning to go to Europe early next week. It is noted that Mr. Davis is actually serving as the President's Ambassador to Europe and will also attend the economic conference. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Freely Criticize</p>
<p>Paris - Although Mr. MacDonald's disarmament relief plan has not yet been made public, and only a summary of its main points is known, French public opinion has now unanimously risen up to attack it and predicted that the French government will reject it. Le Figaro believes that Mr. MacDonald's plan is unacceptable, while Le Petit Journal says that the plan's intention is to satisfy everyone, but the result is that no one is satisfied. Mr. Botin, the editor of L'Écho de Paris, openly questioned whether Mr. MacDonald has the qualifications of an international arbitrator and accused Mr. MacDonald of colluding with Mussolini, using the naval balance between France and Italy as bait, so that France alone suffers the harm. Le Journal de Paris said that France will never agree to the possibility of naval equality between France and Italy, and believes that everything regarding naval equality between France and Italy is the main body of Mr. MacDonald's proposal. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Japan is Subtly Sarcastic</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japan is not very fond of the recent disarmament proposals put forward by Britain and Italy, as it feels that they are purely directed at Europe. The Japanese naval community believes that there is very little new information in the proposals and expresses doubts about whether the implementation of restrictions on aircraft can succeed. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Diverse Discussions After the Meeting</p>
<p>Geneva - The plan put forward by British Prime Minister MacDonald has become the target of all conversations in the lounge of the Disarmament Conference. Delegations from various countries conducted detailed reviews this morning. Most delegations intend to return to their respective capitals to consult with their governments. Judging from the comments in the newspapers of various countries received in Geneva, the impressions of various countries are roughly the same as the situation in this interview. The German side believes that the British plan is not a true disarmament plan and criticizes this type of plan, saying that it cannot satisfy the promise of equality in armaments. However, the Germans took note of Mr. MacDonald's statement that the plan is not immutable. The German side intends to propose many important amendments. The Italian side seems to be maintaining a cautious silence because the British Prime Minister personally visited Mussolini. The attitude of the Italian delegation is no different from this. The British plan has a concrete result for the issue of air force reduction, that is, the Air Force Committee believes that it should postpone its work in order to study the air force clauses in the MacDonald plan. Even though the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, urged it to continue the meeting, it ignored him. Mr. MacDonald said in his speech yesterday, "I have a friend who I most respect, who recently made very serious remarks. This person is a great advocate of international peace. I have great trust in this friend because he has done so much for peace. This friend said, 'Germany must receive fair and free treatment. Otherwise, Germany will be able to destroy.'" Mr. MacDonald said that these words have profound meaning. Recently, someone asked MacDonald who the friend he was referring to was. MacDonald replied that he was referring to the German Foreign Minister Neurath. Among the discussions about MacDonald's speech, the most generally noted was the issue of amending the Treaty of Versailles. Mr. MacDonald mentioned this twice in his speech. The first time he said, "The treaty can certainly be amended, but it should not be done under the point of a gun, but by exchanging views at the meeting table." The second time he said, "If you truly want to write a new volume of post-war European history, then you should strive to adapt to the natural process of historical evolution and admit that a transition period is necessary." The general interpretation of these two paragraphs of the speech is that they refer to the amendment of the military clauses of the various post-European War treaties. However, some people have a different interpretation, saying that MacDonald will expand his claims to other clauses of the treaty in his talks after arriving in Rome. This morning, MacDonald met with the foreign ministers of Poland and Czechoslovakia. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Glimpses of Public Opinion in Various Countries</p>
<p>London - British newspapers have praised British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan, but German newspapers have viewed it coldly because it does not express equality in armaments. Italian newspapers did not criticize it, but it is heard that the Italian government agrees in principle with this plan, especially approving of the naval methods. Although the United States does not agree with certain details, public opinion is still good. The New York Times said that the State Department has expressed its feelings that France has no clear expression on this plan. French newspapers refer to this as the 57th disarmament plan in 13 months, but at the same time praised the British Prime Minister's good intentions. The nationalist newspapers in France attacked the proposal to reduce the army. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira</p>
<p>Scheduled to Return Home at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Discussing the Current Situation in North China with the Authorities - Japanese Parliamentarians Actually Colluding with Warlords</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Ambassador to China Arima Akira will return to Japan at the end of this month to discuss the situation in North China after Zhang Xueliang resigned with domestic authorities. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese House of Peers opened at 10:17 this morning. Minister of the Army Araki reported on the progress of the operations in Rehe. Subsequently, members of the House of Peers raised questions one after another, saying that the operations in the early stages of the invasion of Rehe were quite smooth due to Tang Yulin's non-resistance. However, in this attack on the various passes of the Great Wall, the Chinese army actively resisted, causing heavy losses to the main force of the Japanese army and numerous casualties for days. If North China is not attacked early, future sacrifices will be unpredictable. Minister of the Army Araki immediately replied that whether or not to attack North China is a matter of diplomatic and military secrets and cannot be clearly answered. However, if the Chinese army continues to invade and occupy Rehe territory, the military has made considerable preparations and will immediately take necessary actions when necessary. Currently, the Japanese military has been holding military conferences every day, and the mood is particularly tense. It is heard that the assessment of the Chinese army and various operations have been prepared one after another. (China United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Accompanied by Matsuoka to the United States</p>
<p>London - Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Mellon left London this morning for Southampton to board the liner (Leviathan) for New York. Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke, who is returning to Japan from the United States, departed in the same car. Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Sir Vansittart, the Belgian and Polish ambassadors to the United Kingdom, and the Italian Chargé d'Affaires to the United Kingdom all went to the station to see Mellon off. Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira and Ambassador to Belgium Sato went to the station to see Matsuoka off. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in New York</p>
<p>Ask the United States to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Nanjing - The New York Chinese Native Association previously sent letters to the U.S. Department of State and the new and old presidents, requesting the enforcement of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to restrain Japan's atrocities in China. The U.S. Department of State's Far Eastern Division Director Remington replied to the Association, stating that the Department and the White House received your resolution on the same day, requesting a legal solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Department will fulfill the treaty and maintain world peace, etc. (Special Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Herriot</p>
<p>Comments on the Japanese Invasion of Rehe</p>
<p>Japan's Attack Was Planned Long Ago - World Peace is Threatened - The Great Powers Take United Action</p>
<p>Geneva - Former French Prime Minister Herriot recently wrote a special article in the Aix-les-Bains newspaper on the Japanese invasion of Rehe, stating that Japan's renewed aggressive offensive is changing the balance of power in the Far East and will threaten world peace. This matter was clearly planned long ago. The issue of the safety of Beiping will arise sooner or later. From a legal point of view, a discussion of Article 16 of the Covenant is almost unavoidable. Since a state of war already exists, the Covenant itself is also on the verge of danger. If the United States and Russia refuse to assist, Europe will be powerless to stand by coldly, which could cause serious results for the League of Nations. If imperialism triumphs, then all peaceful efforts since 1918 will be in vain. The Advisory Committee should find a way to determine whether mediation is still possible, reduce conflicts, and oppose the revival of power. Only the firm unity of the world can limit the danger. The different actions of the great powers should be avoided. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Interrogation by the Privy Council Completed</p>
<p>Criticism of the Government's Diplomatic Failure - Meeting Again Today to Decide Attitude</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Privy Council Review Committee held its second meeting today and questioned the government on various policies after withdrawing from the League of Nations. The attitude of the committee on this issue is that the committee will express its hope regarding future diplomatic policies tomorrow, recognize the original proposal, and have Deputy Chairman Hiranuma and two secretaries prepare a report to be submitted to the formal meeting on the 22nd. (Nichi-Nichi News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Privy Council and a portion of the political community believe that the current cabinet's diplomacy towards the League of Nations has shortcomings, leading to the withdrawal, which cannot be said to be a failure, so there has been much criticism, and some have even advocated for the responsibility of Foreign Minister Uchida. The government will raise the following points to refute these criticisms. At the Privy Council's main meeting on the 22nd, it is naturally expected that the consultation on withdrawal will be unanimously approved. First, Japan's formal recognition of the independence of Manchuria and the signing of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol is the basis for withdrawing from the League of Nations. The League of Nations has always adhered to European-centric politics. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is a matter of course, especially with the decision to adopt Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Enemy Use Regulations. In other words, since it has adopted a recommendation案 that includes non-recognition of Manchuria, it has no choice but to sever ties with the League of Nations in order to maintain the spirit of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. First, although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the policy of international coordination remains unchanged. In the future, Japanese diplomacy will be more satisfactory without the hand of the so-called intermediate agencies of the League of Nations and by separately dealing with the powers directly. Therefore, there is no practical harm to diplomacy. (Dentsu News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was substantially decided as a result of the second deliberation in the Privy Council today, with the withdrawal officially announced on the morning of the 22nd or the middle of the 23rd. Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Uchida will enter the palace together on the 21st to express the government's attitude and explain the process of withdrawing from the League of Nations in detail to the Emperor. At the same time, a formal notification and a statement of the reasons for withdrawing from the League of Nations will be submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, in Geneva in the name of Dr. Sugimura. (China United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Privy Council stated today that, in the government's opinion, the South Sea Islands under Japan's mandate are part of Japanese territory. Even though Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the League of Nations has no right to forcibly seize them from Japan's hands. It is noted that the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that the Caroline, Palau, Mariana, and Marshall Islands, all owned by Germany in the Pacific north of the equator except for Guam, are entrusted to Japan for administration.

<p>Luo and Jiang Pass Through Jinan</p>
<p>Arriving in Beijing This Morning</p>
<p>Jinan - Luo Wengan and Jiang Zuobin returned to Beijing via Jinan today. Luo said that he was returning to Beijing to clear up backlog of incidents. He could not come north recently, nor could he go to Shanghai to meet Wang Jingwei. One party hopes to negotiate directly, while the other party is using military pressure. In fact, it is purely a rumor. We can be defeated, but we will never surrender. Jiang said that he naturally could not return to his post recently. The situation within Japan is also extremely complex. The radical young soldiers and young people advocate aggression, while the conservative literati and capitalists believe that it is extremely dangerous to be an enemy of the world, but they dare not speak because the radicals are currently in power. The economy is also extremely panic-stricken. In short, they will not be able to survive in the future. Luo also said that the League of Nations has just passed the report and recently formed an advisory committee, which is absolutely sympathetic to us. (Special Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">General Headquarters Sets Deadline to Recover Yongxin <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Huangpi and Dongpi Both Reportedly Recaptured</p>
<p>Nanchang – Chairman Chiang believes Yongxin has been occupied by bandits for five years, serving as a base for bandits on the lower Gan River and the Xiang border. General Headquarters has ordered the Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong armies to recover it by a set deadline. A certain division obtained a secret document from the bandits, and aside from military secrets, the remaining official documents are as follows: The bandit army is divided into five routes: 1. The pseudo-Third Army Corps, Fifth and Seventh Armies harass southern Jiangxi, Wan'an, Taihe, and Suichuan; 2. The pseudo-Seventh Army Corps, Twelfth Army harass eastern Jiangxi, western Fujian, and Jishui and Yongfeng counties; 3. The pseudo-Seventh Army Corps, Twenty-second Army set out to various places on the west bank of the Gan River. The above three routes specialize in sabotage and disrupting public order, with no fixed time or location, not establishing strong camps, and not engaging in decisive battles, colluding with the pseudo-Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Independent Divisions, as well as the pseudo-Guard Battalion and pseudo-Guerrilla Teams, to provide mutual support and contain the advancing Nationalist army. 4. The pseudo-Fifteenth Army Corps is divided into three routes for mobile warfare. 5. The pseudo-Sixth Army Corps and pseudo-Sixteenth Army harass eastern Hunan and western Jiangxi, opening the Gan-Xiang route, and seizing Ji'an and Zhangshu at opportune moments, forming a mutual support with the fourth route. In terms of tactics: 1. Reconnoiter our garrison numbers and mix in to launch surprise attacks; 2. Intercept our telegrams to avoid being detected; 3. Use beautiful women to gather military intelligence and influence officers and soldiers; 4. Spread rumors to create a false impression and exhaust us, then launch surprise attacks; 5. Hide weapons and utilize mountainous terrain for flexible advance and retreat. In terms of strategic aspects of our in-depth encirclement and ambush strategy: 1. Use a small number of remaining and exhausted troops to probe our strength; 2. Use relatively strong bandits to restrain us and dismantle our connections; 3. Use a small number of bandit crowds to advance in successive waves, we advance and they retreat, avoiding contact to exhaust us; 4. Use the weak and vulnerable to attack, feigning repeated defeats to make us arrogant and negligent in defense. The above can represent the entire bandit military strategy, and the bandits' operations do not go beyond the above framework, but our army has already determined a countermeasure to annihilate the bandits, which can be quickly eliminated.

<p>Nanchang – The victory report on the 15th: Wu Dawei captured Huangpi, Li Mo'an captured Dongpi. The First Column, Chen Shiji, Xia Chuzhong, Xiao Qian, Huo Miaozhang, etc., pursued the bandits. The pseudo-135th Army Corps and pseudo-22nd Army retreated in two routes, one fleeing to the southern part of Yongfeng and Le'an, and the other to the northern part of Guangchang and Ningdu. Guangchang was immediately captured. Chen Jitang's representative in Jiangxi, Zhu Nanyong, returned to the province from Guangxi to report to the General Headquarters on the joint suppression of Guangdong and Guangxi, discussing a general offensive, and said that the Southwest Anti-Japanese Army was ready and awaiting orders to go north.

On the 12th, Luo's division, guided by the Guangning police force, ambushed the Xiaopu area and intercepted the bandits as they passed by.

<p>Germany Is Forced to Be an Enemy of Its Neighbors, Endangering World Peace</p>
<p>American Politicians Advocate Solving Latent Political Problems</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th – According to opinions expressed by famous American politicians today, at a time when war is now openly breaking out in the East, the European situation is again tense, with Germany and its neighbors as the center, which endangers world peace no less than the war in the East. The World War Treaty has never been ratified by the United States. The map of Europe has been changed by this treaty. The changes in its borders disregard the wishes of the local people even more, so there are several places that are constant sources of conflict between groups and countries. This has been seen repeatedly. In addition, the political divisions of disputes naturally cause all kinds of panic when countries are separated by lines on the map. Therefore, the intention of American politicians is that before solving the arms problem, these latent political problems must be solved. However, they say that this kind of work is now becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>A Glorious Page of Battle History at Xifengkou</p>
<p>Five Hundred Brave Soldiers of Our Army Heroically Sacrificed</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Enemy Soldiers Died Under the Blades of Broadswords</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that the battle at Xifengkou has been extremely fierce, and our side has achieved a great victory. Approximately ten thousand or more enemy soldiers from two brigades were surrounded and slashed to death by the troops of Song Zheyuan. This battle involved extremely brave sacrifices by our frontline soldiers and truly added a page of glory to our nation.

<p>Five Hundred Brave Soldiers Heroically Sacrificed - On the 9th of the month, the troops of Wan Fulin retreated from Kuancheng towards Xifengkou. The enemy army closely pursued from behind. Taking advantage of the fact that our new troops had not yet taken over the defense, they occupied the Xifengkou mountain. Further relying on their victory and showing contempt for the enemy, all four brigades of the 13th climbed the mountain, and all their military equipment and artillery were moved into the mountain as well. At this time, the troops of Song Zheyuan were still in Zunhua. Upon hearing of the change, they immediately issued orders on the morning of the 9th to advance towards Xifengkou. The journey was approximately 150 li. By 4 PM, they had reached the vicinity of the Great Wall. Upon seeing the Japanese army guarding the city, all the soldiers were filled with righteous indignation. The vanguard unit, the division of Feng Zhi'an, immediately selected elite soldiers from the battalion. At dusk, each holding a broadsword and stripped to the waist, they advanced. They climbed onto the city walls and immediately drew their swords to slash and kill. The Japanese soldiers guarding the city were caught completely unprepared. Many were killed before they could even retaliate. In a short time, all one thousand Japanese soldiers guarding the city were killed, and the five hundred soldiers of our side who bravely killed the enemy were also sacrificed at the same time. Only about twenty survivors remained. This heroic and tragic event truly won great glory for our nation and inspires the admiration of the people of our country.</p>
<p>Night Attack on Enemy Camp, Killing Thousands of Enemies - At the meeting at Fengkou, the strategy for attacking was discussed. At 12 AM that night, a night attack was launched on the enemy camp. Each army advanced stealthily. With extreme speed, they fiercely struck the enemy's second line of defense. That night, over a thousand enemies were killed. Our side also suffered casualties. At 9 AM on the 10th, the enemy ordered a general attack, bombarding our positions with heavy artillery. Their bombardment tactics were no different from those used in the European war. The density of the shells was similar to that of bullets. When the enemy heavily bombarded, our army retreated from the original line of defense, lying prone and still, waiting. After more than three hours, the enemy's bombardment gradually subsided, and our army rapidly advanced to the original line of defense. At this time, the sky was dim, and yellow sand covered the surface. Our army, lying prone, advanced to a point three or four meters away from the enemy and launched a fierce surprise attack. In this battle, another thousand enemies were killed, and morale was greatly boosted.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle All Night, Surrounding the Enemy - On the night of the 10th, our side launched another night attack, sending two columns of soldiers to bypass the mountain peaks from the left and right to carry out an encirclement. The fierce battle that night was the most intense. The enemy was caught off guard. By dawn on the 11th, the two regiments of our army advancing from the left and right had converged at Dongjiakou behind the enemy, completing the encirclement. A large encirclement, twenty li in circumference, was formed by our army. The enemy army was in internal disarray. Over ten cannons placed behind the army were seized by our army. By the night of the 11th, the enemy's artillery unit had been completely destroyed by our army. The enemy's morale was extremely demoralized. They scrambled to hide in the mountains. From the night of the 11th onwards, our army continuously dispatched broadsword teams to search the enemy in the mountains overnight. Two-thirds of the prisoners were Japanese soldiers. In addition to the puppet troops, there were also Koreans mixed among them. As of the 13th, only two mountains had not yet been completely searched. All the other mountains had been cleared. The number of captured spoils of war was very large. The detailed numbers will take one or two more days to ascertain.</p>
<p>The Key to Victory Lies in Swiftness - In the Battle of Xifengkou, ten thousand enemies were annihilated in three days and nights, and spoils of war worth approximately ten million yuan were captured. This was the first major victory since the outbreak of the Rehe Incident. There were three main reasons for being able to achieve victory: First, the army was swift in movement. The army was most skilled in running exercises and moved swiftly on the battlefield, often catching the enemy off guard and forcing its way into key positions, launching fierce attacks, and causing the enemy to suffer repeated heavy blows. Second, night battles were used. When fighting at night, the enemy's aircraft, tanks, and other modern weapons could not be used. This precisely made up for the shortcomings of our army's lack of equipment. Furthermore, the agile movements of our army further reduced the enemy's combat power. Third, the broadsword team charged. This was a special organization of our Northwest Army and was feared by the Japanese army, which relied solely on scientific weapons. When the broadsword team charged, the enemy often did not have time to resist within a few feet, and heads were immediately separated from bodies. However, this type of charge must be carried out when the enemy is not expecting it. This time, our army had these three advantages, coupled with the soldiers' brave spirit and determination to resist the enemy to the death, so they achieved a great victory in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>The People of the War Zone Unanimously Support - The people of the war zone deeply admire the soldiers who resolutely defend the country and resist foreign aggression. Without waiting to be supplied, the local villagers, regardless of the size of their households, steamed buns to supply the army. In terms of supplies, there will be no problem for ten days. However, relying solely on the supply of the villagers is ultimately inappropriate. The rear should think of more practical ways to adequately supply the soldiers at the front. According to Quan Shaowu, it has been decided to launch a memorial for the five hundred and seventy soldiers of Feng's division who bravely killed the enemy and sacrificed their lives, in order to commend them. Quan will carry a large amount of comfort items back to Xifengkou on the morning of the 15th to comfort the army and prepare to bring back a portion of the spoils of war as a souvenir when returning to Beiping.

<h3 id="e53">Luo Wen'gan Denies Direct Negotiations <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Jiang's Opinion Is the Government's Established Policy</p>
<p>Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations Are Purely Groundless Rumors</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan went to Beiping on the 14th from Baoding to meet with Jiang [Jieshi], and met with He Yingqin, Huang Shaohong, and others. On the 15th, he left Beiping and returned to Nanjing. Before leaving, he issued the following remarks: (This time, I went to Baoding to visit Chairman Jiang. The matters discussed were all very satisfactory. Chairman Jiang's opinion on Japan is also the government's established policy. The rumors of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are purely groundless. I don't know where such rumors originated. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has first appealed to the League of Nations on the basis of reason. I have also accepted the resolution of the League of Nations and cannot overturn the previous resolution. Since our country is cooperating with the League of Nations, we will proceed according to the League of Nations' report. In any case, we will not change our attitude. For example, a company has a contract with someone and cannot break it. I have solemnly declared this point to the foreign press. The visits of the British, American, and French envoys were only social conversations. As for the report that the government has formulated a new diplomatic policy, I am afraid it is just speculation. As for the so-called new diplomatic policy, I really don't know about it, and I haven't officially heard of it. My travels between Nanjing, Beiping, and Baoding are not for any major task. I am only gathering with the authorities to have discussions. This is a personal action. The problem with Japan cannot be solved solely through diplomatic means. Apart from fighting it, there is really no other good way. The fierce battle and great victory of Song Zheyuan's troops at Xifengkou is truly the glory of our Chinese nation.) (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Yan Discusses the Results of Meeting with Jiang <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Shanxi to Dispatch Three Armies to Take Charge of Defense of Chahar</p>
<p>The Chairman of Chahar Province Will Absolutely Not Be Changed</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan states that Yan Xishan went to Shijiazhuang on the 11th to meet with Jiang [Jieshi] to discuss major plans for resisting Japan. He returned to Taiyuan from Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 12th. According to Yan's remarks on the results of meeting with Jiang in Shijiazhuang, he said: (Both Chairman Jiang and I believe that the deterioration of national affairs is extremely distressing. In the future, we can only unite as a nation, unite sincerely, each fulfill their responsibilities, and carry out a planned and determined joint struggle to save the country from danger. It is rumored that the defense of Chahar will be taken over by the Shanxi army. Chahar is a crucial defense line for Rehe, with a length of over one thousand li. It is still far from enough to fulfill this defense solely by exerting the full strength of the Jin-Sui army. This time, the anti-Japanese war is under the unified command of the Beiping Military Branch. The Jin-Sui army has dispatched three armies under the command of the Beiping Military Branch. Where they will be dispatched and what tasks they will undertake will be determined by the orders of the Beiping Military Branch. It is not that the Jin-Sui army will exclusively take over the defense of Chahar. As for the military expenses of the Jin-Sui army, the regular expenses will still be borne by Jin-Sui, while the wartime expenses and logistics expenses will be borne by the Beiping Military Branch. Chairman Jiang will temporarily reside in North China to preside over everything. The news that Fu Zuoyi will preside over Chahar and Hebei is definitely not true. Such rumors are enough to disrupt the anti-Japanese front. Even if the central government has such an order, Fu will definitely firmly decline. It must not be allowed for rumors of power struggles to arise amidst the anti-Japanese reality. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Chen Jitang Arrives in Shantou <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Calls Party, Military, and Political Circles for Instructions</p>
<p>Will Return to the Province Via Meixian and Huizhou</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou states that Chen Jitang departed from the province on the 2nd aboard the Hai Zhou warship for an eastern inspection. On the 3rd, he arrived at Shanwei in Haifeng County, and immediately disembarked there. On the 4th, he convened instructions for all sectors in the county seat of Haifeng. At noon, he went to Lufeng. On the 5th, he gave instructions in Lufeng. On the 6th, he went to Lihu in Puning to inspect Liusha with Division Commander Zhang Ruigui. It was heard that he also went to Guiyu and Xiashan in Chaoyang to discuss plans for the aftermath of the Nanshan bandit area. At 2 PM on the 7th, Chen arrived in Jieyang from Chaoyang. County Magistrate Li Henian sent out a guard cadre team to temporarily impose martial law for protection. After Chen had dinner in Jieyang, he set off for Shantou, arriving at 9:30 PM. Those who came with him included Division Commanders Huang Renhuan and Zhang Ruigui, as well as more than thirty staff members and guards. The Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, Chen Zhongying, the Municipal Party Committee member Yu Zuming, and Mayor Zhai Zongxin all welcomed him at the pier. That night, Chen stayed at the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, while Zhang and Huang stayed at the Sihai Hotel. Chen immediately summoned the county magistrates and local leaders of the Chaoshan area to Shantou for instructions, and reported on the implementation of the three-year plan in Guangdong Province, and consulted with all sectors.</p>
<p>At noon on the 8th, nine heavily wounded soldiers were carried on canvas stretchers to the Qizhong Municipal Hospital. Accompanying them were Red Cross personnel. It was said that on the night of the 6th, in Jieyang City, while escorting Chen Jitang through Chengbeimen Street, there was a sudden roaring sound followed by chaotic gunfire for about a few minutes. More than ten people were killed and injured on the spot, and the soldiers were also injured. Fortunately, Chen was unharmed. On the 8th, all sectors of Shantou held a welcoming meeting. Chen declined to attend the meeting, and instead hosted all sectors at the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters. The Municipal Party Committee issued a notice to each organization to send two people to the meeting. More than two hundred people attended that day, and the security was tight. Chen went downstairs to take his seat at 3:30 PM, and gave a speech to all sectors for an hour, regarding national difficulties, construction issues, national defense, reforms, and the abolition of heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies to relieve the suffering of the people. After the meeting, Chen told the press that Guangdong's support army for Rehe has been determined, but the choice of commander has not been decided. He also planned to send personnel to Guangxi to investigate the militia organization in order to organize the people into disciplined forces. On the 9th, Chen summoned the leaders of political parties for instructions. On the 10th, he summoned the officers of the Third Army and the staff of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters for instructions. In the afternoon, he visited the Poor People's Handicraft Institute.

<h3 id="e56">Appeal to Exempt or Reduce Land Tax Approved by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the continued imposition of land tax in Jiangsu Province, representatives such as Qian Ding from the four counties of Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, and Wujiang were previously elected to go to Nanjing to appeal. Now it is known that Qian and others have received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that the claim of repeated water disasters, wars, and low rice prices leading to the economic collapse of the rural areas is still factual. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has been ordered to reduce or halve the additional land tax for the 21st year of the Republic in the counties that suffered water disasters and wars, according to the severity of the disaster.</p>
<p>Wuxi Jiangyin Murder Case Transferred to Wuxi for Trial</p>
<p>Sun Peiji, a resident of Xijie in Jiangyin City, who repairs rickshaws for a living, has a wife, Shi, and a concubine, Jiang (from Nanzha), living together in the same house. In the middle of July last year, a quarrel suddenly broke out between the wife and concubine, leading to discord in the family. On the night of October 2nd, Jiang suddenly committed suicide by jumping into the river. The county government of Jiangyin believed that Sun Peiji was suspected of murder, and arrested Sun for interrogation, detaining him until now without a verdict. Recently, Sun Peiji believed that the county had deliberately detained him and delayed the verdict, and appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court, requesting a transfer of jurisdiction. The acting County Magistrate Wang of the county government recently received an order from Chief Judge Lin, ordering Sun Peiji to be transferred to the Wuxi County Court for trial. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang prepared a document and sent police yesterday to escort Sun Peiji to Wuxi for delivery to the County Court for trial. In the afternoon, at around 5 PM, Prosecutor Shen opened the court for interrogation, and then ordered him to be detained pending further investigation and processing.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Dispute Over Donations for Aircraft Purchase <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The cloth industry association of this county previously telegraphed the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Textile Industry Federation, proposing that the 80,000 to 90,000 yuan collected from the cotton yarn industry fund be used to support aircraft donations. The cloth industry businesses in Wujin and Cheng counties also unanimously agreed. Now it is learned that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Textile Industry Federation has allocated the fund to open the Wanyuan Cotton Yarn Factory, with a planned capital of 300,000 yuan. The factory site is located in Suzhou, and industry representatives from various counties have been appointed as preparatory committee members to actively prepare. Therefore, a special letter was sent to the cloth industry association of this county for verification. After receiving the letter, the association plans to convene a meeting of industry members to solicit opinions. However, Cheng Jingdang, a local resident who was nominated as a preparatory committee member for the Wanyuan Cotton Yarn Factory, believes that during this time of national crisis, it is not the time to prepare for the factory, and donating to purchase aircraft is a matter of jointly facing the national crisis. Therefore, he declared that he was unwilling to attend the preparatory meeting of the factory and advocated to the counties that they should voluntarily withdraw the fund for donations if necessary. The Wujin Textile Industry Association also sent a letter to Cheng, expressing their unanimous opposition to the construction of the factory. In addition, the county government of this county received an order from the province, instructing it to immediately raise donations for the purchase of aircraft, organize a county aircraft donation collection and management committee, and stipulate that this county, as a first-class county, should raise 20,000 yuan in the first phase. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen has been actively carrying it out and has sent letters to the county chamber of commerce and the county party department, requesting them to quickly recommend one representative each to convene an establishment meeting to discuss implementation.</p>
<p>Changshu Water Police Seize a Large Batch of Farming Cattle</p>
<p>The water police stationed in Fushan Town in the eighth district received a tip-off the day before yesterday, stating that a large batch of farming cattle was being transported out of the country to be slaughtered in Shanghai. Secret slaughtering of farming cattle is prohibited by provincial regulations. Moreover, during this spring plowing season, attention should be paid. It was requested that the cattle be seized, and so on. After receiving the report, Captain Xie Pinfang immediately dispatched several policemen to wait at Dengshi. In the afternoon of the 15th, several boats were indeed found carrying dozens of farming cattle. The people, boats, and cattle were all detained and sent to the district office for processing.</p>
<p>Nantong The Ministry of Military Administration Auctions Off Military Land</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Administration investigated and found that the land of the old Su Zhen and Langshan camps had been encroached upon by the Tonghai Reclamation Company. It was approved by the National Government that the company should pay compensation. If they were unwilling, the land would be recovered and auctioned off. The Ministry of Military Administration found that the company had not complied with the payment, so it specially consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the county magistrates of Nantong and Haimen to jointly auction it off and complete the process.</p>

<p>At the home of farmer Zhang Yousheng in Nansongzhuang, the ninth district of the county, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came the night before, each holding firearms. They tied up his entire family with ropes, guarded by one bandit. The remaining bandits rushed into the bedroom and searched extensively, stealing clothing and silver dollars worth about 200 yuan. Not yet satisfied, the bandits kidnapped his son and demanded a ransom of 1,000 yuan, or they would tear up the ticket.</p>
<p>Jiaxing The Chief of the Water Police District Removed from Office and Transferred to the Province</p>
<p>Zhao Zezhou, the chief of the second water police district of Jiaxing, has been in office for several months. He has not achieved any success in arresting criminals, but he has been meticulous in sending people to search for opium dens and gambling dens and extort money on the pretext of doing so. Therefore, the rural areas have been greatly harassed, and local people have complained. Last month, Dafeng Temple Town was looted by bandits, and more than a dozen men and women were kidnapped. No bandit has been arrested yet. Recently, the province sent personnel to He [Jiaxing] for inspection and found out all kinds of things. The report to the province on the 16th led to the province's removal of Zhao from his post and his transfer to the province. Secretary Fang Xuchu was assigned to He as an agent.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Wang Jingwei Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Firm Refusal of Premiership</p>
<p>Cabinet Ministers of the National Government All Go to the Port to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sends Personal Letter Urging Wang to Return to Nanjing Immediately to Resume Duties</p>
<p>To Rest Briefly in Shanghai for Two or Three Days Before Proceeding to Nanjing</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, took leave for medical treatment in Germany last December. Due to the pressing national crisis, he was repeatedly urged by telegram from the Central Government. He embarked on the French postal ship "Aramis" in Europe last month, arriving in Shanghai at 3:20 PM yesterday. Cabinet ministers of the National Government and representatives went to the port to welcome him. Song Ziwen, the Acting Premier of the Executive Yuan, took a customs launch to Songkou first, boarding the ship to greet him. After the ship docked, Wang, Song, and others transferred to a small launch to disembark at the New Customs Wharf, proceeding directly to the Chu residence on Avenue Albert for rest. Wang issued a written statement in the cabin, expressing his firm refusal of the premiership and recommending Song for the actual position. Wang himself wished to serve in the Central Party Headquarters. Song Ziwen also told reporters that Wang was weary from his journey and would rest briefly in Shanghai for two or three days before proceeding to Nanjing. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome Yesterday morning, those who went to the port to welcome Wang included Acting Premier Song Ziwen, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, and Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs Tang Haian, among others, who took the customs vessel "Kesheng" to the central pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hongkou to welcome Wang.

In addition, there were representatives from various organizations and groups, such as the dock workers' union, the woodworking union, and others, each holding welcome flags, causing the road to be congested by those wishing to see Wang's countenance. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a military band to the pier to welcome him. French Consul-General Meyrier specially sent Police Commissioner Febvre and Deputy Commissioner Rabaute to represent him, and ordered Political Director Salley and Inspector Cheng Ziqing to lead many detectives to provide protection.</p>
<p>Security at the Wharf The security at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf yesterday when Wang arrived was stricter than usual because there were over two thousand people there to welcome him. Therefore, police and detectives were stationed at the entrance of the outer Hongqiao, along the bank, at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company entrance and all points of embarkation and disembarkation, with strict precautions. On the wharf, the Public Security Team Inspector Xi Kui led over forty policemen, armed with loaded Mauser pistols, standing guard around the perimeter. On the Huangpu River, Water Patrol Team Captain Zhu Haishan led police in two small launches, patrolling the river. The Shanghai Municipal Council also sent over a dozen detectives to the Jianghai Customs Wharf to be on standby.</p>
<p>Arrival Circumstances The French ship Aramis, on which Wang and others were travelling, entered the Wusongkou at 1:15 PM yesterday and arrived at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's central pier in Hongkou at 2:30 PM. At 2:50 PM, it docked, and the military band began playing music to welcome them. Acting Premier Song Ziwen had already taken the customs vessel Kesheng with Secretary-General Chu Minyi, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, and Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs Tang Haian, among others, to board the Aramis in the river to meet Wang, offering their welcome with great enthusiasm. Wang then went with Song and others to the outer deck, removing his hat to nod and wave to those welcoming him. He then received the welcoming personnel who boarded the ship, shaking hands and exchanging greetings one by one. The scene was exceptionally warm. At 3:33 PM, Wang, accompanied by Song Ziwen, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jiahua, and others, transferred to the customs vessel Kesheng, which sailed from the Jiangmian pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the New Customs Wharf. Eleven members of the Customs Water Patrol Team and the Song residence guard escorted them on the ship. Chu Minyi, Tang Haian, and others took the Jinghui ship to the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<p>Wang's Demeanor Wang was wearing a gray Western suit yesterday, his face fuller than when he left the country, and his spirit was quite vibrant. Those accompanying Wang, besides his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and his daughter, Binbin, included Tie Ci, Zeng Zhongming, Secretary Li Haoju, attending physician Luo Guanglin, and German physician Noel, a total of seven people.</p>
<p>Gathering at the Chu Residence After disembarking, Wang was accompanied by Song Ziwen in his car, number 2844, first driving to Chu Minyi's residence at 408 Avenue Albert at 3:45 PM for rest. Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo visited Wang around 4 PM. Military Affairs Commission member Zhu Peide, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Shuren, Gansu Provincial Chairman Shao Lizi, Central Committee member Zhang Qun, and Central Political Council Secretary Tang Youren also arrived one after another, gathering for thirty minutes. Then Song Ziwen left at 4:30 PM. The other ministers, except Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Zeng Zhongming, and Zhu Jiahua, who left after 6 PM, all left before 5 PM.</p>
<p>Urging Him to Resume Duties National Government Chairman Lin Zichao was unable to come to Shanghai personally to welcome Wang due to pressing political affairs. In addition to sending Chu Minyi as his representative, he also entrusted a personal letter to Chu Minyi to hand over to Wang, asking Wang to return to Nanjing upon arrival in Shanghai to preside over the central government and tide over the difficulties. Acting Premier Song Ziwen and Central Committee member Zhang Qun, representing Chairman Chiang, also earnestly urged Wang to return to Nanjing immediately to resume his duties. Wang expressed that he would definitely go to Nanjing within three days, but requested that Song be appointed as the actual Premier of the Executive Yuan, and that he himself would dedicate himself to the duties of the Central Party Headquarters, intending to return to Shanghai for recuperation after going to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Wang's Condition When Wang discussed his condition with those who met him yesterday, he claimed that his diabetes had been completely cured, but his liver disease, after developing cirrhosis, could no longer be reversed. He could only maintain its state and prevent further changes. He would leave the cirrhotic part to nature.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Nanjing in the Next Few Days After leaving the Chu residence, Acting Premier Song spoke with reporters in an off-the-record conversation. (Question) Premier Wang said during his arrival speech that he was resigning from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan and reiterating his previous request. Will Acting Premier Song continue to act? (Answer) I do not yet know. (Question) You must have discussed it on the ship. (Answer) We only talked about what happened after we parted, not about this matter. (Question) When will Premier Wang go to Nanjing? (Answer) He is tired from his journey and may rest for a short time before proceeding to Nanjing in two or three days.</p>
<p>Written Statement Wang issued a statement in the cabin after arriving, saying, "I have suffered from liver disease for several years. When it flares up, I am unable to do anything. Last December, I entered the hospital established by Dr. Noel and discovered the source of the disease. After the doctor released his diagnosis last October, the central government, understanding the severity of my illness, granted me several months of leave to seek treatment in Europe. Dr. Noel had originally planned to return to Europe this spring but advanced his trip by several months to accompany me, taking care of me along the way. After arriving in Europe, I was introduced by Dr. Noel to the Tropical Diseases Specialist Hospital in Southern Germany and then to the Kaspar Spa Sanatorium in Czechoslovakia. My condition gradually improved. I had originally planned to finish treatment at the end of April and return to the country in early May. However, after hearing the news of the tragedy at Shanhaiguan, I set off in mid-February, hoping to face the national crisis with my colleagues and comrades. However, as my health has not yet fully recovered, I can only offer my humble contributions at the Central Party Headquarters. As for the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is a busy and important responsibility. If I were to take it on reluctantly, I would only spoil things and harm the country. The current Premier of the Executive Yuan is already a capable and responsible person, but the title of 'Acting' has not been removed. I am determined to reiterate my previous request, hoping that the central government will approve it. Wang Jingwei, 17th."</p>

<p>Stops Acting as Premier</p>
<p>Premier Wang Recovers and Returns Home</p>
<p>The Central Government Already Has a Leader</p>
<p>From Yesterday Onwards, Ceases Acting</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government To the Central Political Conference of the National Government, Nanjing: Since September of last year, Premier Wang took leave due to illness to seek treatment elsewhere. Ziwen was ordered to act as Premier as Vice Premier, respectfully following the established rules, and勉將事. Every time Ziwen thought that Premier Wang was a pioneer of our party and a leader of the masses and at this time when the country is broken and a great crisis is upon us, the Central Committee is in urgent need of a leader, the hearts of the people should be bound together and unite to plan for revenge. It would not be enough to save this crisis and help this great difficulty unless Premier Wang presided over the overall plan. Over the past months, not only did Ziwen deeply respect and admire Premier Wang but also earnestly prayed. It was what everyone yearned for. Heaven favored our nation, Premier Wang's old illness was cured, and he returned home. It could not be expressed in words.

<p>To the Ministers of the Executive Yuan and the Chairmen of the Committees, Nanjing: Ziwen has presented a telegram to the Central Political Conference of the National Government, Nanjing, today, saying, "Since September of last year, Premier Wang took leave due to illness to seek treatment elsewhere. Ziwen was ordered to act as Premier as Vice Premier, respectfully following the established rules, and勉將事. Every time Ziwen thought that Premier Wang was a pioneer of our party and a leader of the masses and at this time when the country is broken and a great crisis is upon us, the Central Committee is in urgent need of a leader, the hearts of the people should be bound together and unite to plan for revenge. It would not be enough to save this crisis and help this great difficulty unless Premier Wang presided over the overall plan. For several months</p>

<h3 id="e63">Simpson to Return to England <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Song Hosts Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Presents Silver Cup to Commemorate Achievements</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Sir John Hope Simpson, Chairman of the National Flood Relief Commission, has completed his relief work and is scheduled to return to England on the 26th of this month. Chairman Song Ziwen hosted a banquet at the International Recreation Club last night to bid farewell to Simpson, presenting him with a silver cup to commemorate his service over the past eighteen months. Chinese dishes were served throughout the night. After several rounds of drinks, Song rose to present the cup, briefly stating that the Chinese people will forever be grateful for Sir John Hope Simpson's achievements. Had the National Government not abolished the order system, he would have requested the government to award him the highest order. Since this system has been abolished, he is presenting the silver cup before Sir John Hope Simpson returns to his country to mark his respect and admiration. He hopes that Sir John Hope Simpson will pass it down to his children and grandchildren as a lasting memory of his service to China. Simpson received the cup and thanked him, recounting the arduous work of the commission. Between November 1931 and June of the following year, the commission provided disaster relief to ten million famine victims, distributing food and assigning work to complete the levees. Such outstanding results, even compared to the disaster relief in India in 1895, are inferior. He then discussed the economic, social, and charitable importance of this initiative. Acting Premier Song estimated the cost and time for repairing levees and managing relief funds, which later turned out as expected. His predictions were accurate. However, this initiative is also politically important. In the past, people in the Jianghuai River basin viewed officials only as tax collectors for the government. In the future, they should know that the government pays attention to the welfare of the people. With Acting Premier Song's flood prevention plan, the people of the two major river basins can rest easy.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Northeastern Association <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Advocates Counteroffensive Against Rehe and Encourages Volunteer Army</p>
<p>No Negotiations Until Lost Territory is Recovered</p>
<p>The Northeastern Association telegraphed the nation yesterday, stating, "To all provincial and municipal party headquarters, government agencies, organizations, and newspapers: Since the fall of Chengde, the entire nation has been filled with grief and indignation. Fortunately, our army has resolutely defended the Xifengkou and Weichang areas, inflicting a major setback on the enemy. However, in recent days, the enemy has been making claims about demarcating the Great Wall and threatening to advance to Yuguan, attempting to use its old tricks to lure us into its trap. We are sincerely afraid that the people of our country, with their cowardly and complacent habits, will be deeply rooted in their hearts, and it is inevitable that some will embrace the idea of preserving the remnants and advocating for lenient compromise. The members of this association are not sensitive and dare not remain silent. We believe that the plan for today is to take advantage of the fact that the people's hearts are invigorated, morale is high, and the whole country is mobilized for a long-term large-scale war of resistance, which is not enough to plan for recovery and save the country. It is even more necessary to abandon everything and devote the strength of the whole country to two things: First, we must actively counterattack Rehe. Facts have shown that the enemy's military deployment in Rehe Province has not yet been perfected. If we are internally united and persistent from beginning to end, we will break the cauldron, sink the boat, and fight to the death. Any sacrifice will be spared. If we win, we will return to our mountains and rivers. If we do not win, we will still make the enemy fall into misfortune. This will not only affect the people's hearts for resistance, the unity of the people, and the international diplomatic support for us. Second, we must motivate the Northern Volunteer Army. We are sure to know that there are no less than 200,000 volunteer comrades scattered throughout the East Province, and their latent power is still very great. If we truly provide continuous support and continue to motivate them to increase their active strength and promote their anti-Japanese spirit, they will surely rise up in response, take up their spears, and share the same hatred. In order to recover the Northeast, this is the direct work, and it is enough to contain the enemy's army in the counteroffensive against Rehe. This is the most important opportunity for anti-Japanese military affairs. In short, we should only carry out a positive counteroffensive against Rehe. No negotiations will be held until the lost territory is restored, and the enemy's conspiracy will be countered. In the Northeast, we should not only rely on the League of Nations' moral assistance, but also encourage our own actual power to seek self-salvation. For this reason, we urgently express our sincere desire. Northeast Association bows, 篠</p>

<p>All Accounts and Deeds to Be Changed to Silver Standard</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, saying, "In order to comply with the order, the Ministry previously issued a notice that from the 10th of this month, all receipts and payments of public and private funds and all transactions shall be changed to silver coins, the silver exchange shall be abolished, and the exchange interest shall be used. It has been implemented for several days, and the situation on the market is quite convenient. The Ministry has now decided that the abolition of taels must be implemented in the shortest possible time. The Association is urgently ordered to immediately inform all colleagues that, from the date of receipt of the order, all accounts, deeds, and new loans should be uniformly changed to the silver coin standard and no longer used silver taels. It is hereby announced in advance, and all should follow and report."</p>

<p>The United States is a country that exports silver bars, and large quantities have always been shipped to our country. Recently, the import of U.S. silver bars has gradually decreased. After the recent financial crisis in the U.S., a large shipment of silver suddenly went to the United States from Shanghai. Today, the President Grant of the Grand Shipping Company sailed to the U.S., and the Shanghai Chase Bank and others reported the export of more than 20 boxes of silver blocks, worth a total of more than one million yuan, to San Francisco, U.S. It is a novelty to ship silver from Shanghai to the U.S.</p>

<p>Reports on the Bitter Fighting of Sun's Army</p>
<p>Hosts Press Conference Yesterday</p>
<p>Hopes for Nationwide Assistance</p>
<p>Zhang Youqun, the representative of Sun Dianying, the commander of the 41st Army, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to report to all sectors on the bitter fighting of the army in northern Rehe and to ask for assistance from the people of Shanghai. Zhang hosted a press conference at 7 p.m. yesterday at Yizhi Xiang on Fourth Horse Road, attended by more than 20 reporters from various newspapers. During the conference, Zhang gave a brief report, saying, "Our army set out from southern Jin to aid Rehe, traveling more than 3,000 li. On the 28th of the previous month, we reached the vicinity of Weichang and Chifeng. At that time, the enemy was approaching Chifeng. Fighting with the enemy began on the 1st of this month. On the evening of the 2nd, we lifted the siege of Chifeng. On the 3rd, we counterattacked the enemy and recovered Jianchangying, Cheshuipo, and other places. Unfortunately, Chengde fell, and our army's retreat was cut off. The enemy took advantage of the situation to surround us. Commander Sun personally led 30,000 soldiers in a bloody battle for two days and nights before breaking through the encirclement and concentrating the troops in the area. Since the continuous fighting, the enemy has not succeeded, but it is a desperate and isolated army, lacking supplies and ammunition. In forty degrees below zero, the soldiers are fighting in single clothes and with meager food. If they do not die under the enemy's artillery fire, they will inevitably freeze and starve to death, or die from injuries and illnesses without medical treatment. In addition to those killed in action at the front, dozens or hundreds of people die every day from freezing, starvation, and illness. The number of deaths at the rear is even greater than at the front. All kinds of tragic scenes are unbearable to witness. The entire army is still fighting the enemy in the area. We have sent the artillery brigade left behind in Jin to the front. As soon as the entire anti-Japanese military deployment is in place, we will counterattack Chengde. The soldiers at the front, though in the icy and snowy land, with inadequate clothing and food, are in high spirits. As long as there is food to fill our stomachs and ammunition is not lacking, we will fight the enemy to the end. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up and support us so that we can resist for a long time."</p>

<p>The Whole City Rises Up Together</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Conscription Team of the China Aviation Association began its conscription, all sectors have recognized that air defense is the only urgent task to save the country today. Therefore, they have either actively donated or worked hard to raise funds. At the first conscription unveiling on the 15th, in just half a month, more than 260,000 yuan had been raised, and the scores of the various teams were not even paid, and the number was still quite large. In the past two or three days, the conscription efforts of the various teams have been even more extraordinary, and the enthusiasm of all sectors to donate spontaneously has been very enthusiastic. The latest news received yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e69">Cotton Industry Efforts The Shanghai Conscription Team of the China Aviation Association <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The 333rd team and the 342nd team were merged into the China Cotton Industry Federation. The team leaders are Chen Zixin and Cheng Youfu. Since the beginning of the conscription, they have worked hard to carry out the conscription with no effort spared. Enthusiastic colleagues in the cotton industry are all vying to join. It is reported that the members include Hongrun Flower Firm, Tongfu Flower Firm, Hengda New Yarn Factory, Hengyuanxing Flower Factory, Defengxing Flower Factory, Hengxingtai Oil Factory, Yinglong Weaving Factory, and other colleagues who have actively joined. The teachers and staff of various schools in Yangsi District have also joined the association. Ding Renke, the principal of Pudong Sanlin Primary School, Li Zongwen, the principal of the Vocational School, and Hu Zhusan of Yangsi Town were hired as conscription team members by Chen Zixin, the head of the branch team. They actively raised funds among the schools and local people, and the students and others were engaged in publicity among their families to achieve universal participation. It is also learned that each student in the vocational department of the school, in addition to joining the association themselves, is also responsible for introducing two people to join the association, so the results have been very good in recent days. The first membership fee of 1,700 yuan has been paid.</p>

<p>Promoting the Popularity of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Do Chinese Merchants Still Have Brains?</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 13th that the Chinese government's resistance in Rehe would only last three months. As a result, the Chinese government would inevitably change its diplomatic relations with Japan, and the economic circles in China could escape the harsh environment. Therefore, the trade of Japanese goods has gradually become active. For example, 1. Textiles: Although affected by the Rehe issue, they are not as affected by anti-Japanese sentiment as before, and sales are rebounding. 2. Cotton cloth: In January, 2,755 boxes were imported to Shanghai from Japan, and in February, 3,055 boxes were imported. Although the Rehe incident occurred, the import in February was more than in January. 3. Cotton yarn: Most are sold in small quantities, and more active trade can be expected in the future. 4. Sundries: More active than other commodities, and purchasing power is gradually recovering. 5. Sugar: Orders have been strong in recent days. The import of refined sugar to Shanghai last year reached 48,080 dan, and further progress is now expected. 6. Western paper: Since the anti-Japanese movement, it has been suppressed by Canadian and German products. Now that the anti-Japanese sentiment has weakened, there are also considerable imports and exports. 7. General industry: Recently, factories have expanded to three-tenths of their capacity. 8. Ships: Goods transshipped in Shanghai and sold to Hankou in mid-February amounted to about 3,000 tons, an increase of 500 tons compared to January. 9. Coal and industrial chemicals: Both have gradually recovered from pessimism.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the Osaka Textile Federation's survey of cotton cloth exports to China in mid-February showed a sharp increase to 13 million square yards, which is 35,288 square yards.</p>

<p>Because Hankou Merchants' Boycott of Japanese Goods Becomes More Intense</p>
<p>The boycott of Japanese goods in Hankou has become more active recently. Grain, yarn, and seafood merchants have all decided not to handle enemy goods. Some Chinese employees of Japanese businesses in Hankou have resigned voluntarily. The Japanese strongly claim that this is due to threats from certain groups, and the situation has suddenly become tense. Minei, commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, has ordered staff officer Kikuno to take a destroyer from Shanghai to Hankou.</p>

<p>Li Cishan's Abbreviated Telegram</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association previously sent standing director Li Cishan north with funds to comfort Re Tang. On the way, he heard that Tang had abandoned Chengde and fled before the soldiers. He returned to Beiping. The association received a telegram from Li from Ping yesterday stating, "Ciwen arrived in Ping today and met with journalists and rear personnel of various armies. He learned that the 41st Army led by Sun Dianying fought the hardest and most vigorously. As of today, they are still fighting bitterly with the enemy in the Chifeng West region. Tang's defeated soldiers and people's volunteer army all hope to return to their ranks. The rear transportation has now been properly arranged. Yin Fengshan, a traitor of Tang's unit, wanted to force Sun's defense troops to surrender to the puppet state when he was in Chengde. He was immediately shot and killed by the platoon leader, who then led his troops back to the team. The unit suffered 3,000 casualties, without clothing or shelter, and hundreds died of freezing every day, without complaint. Their loyalty and bravery can serve as an example for anti-Japanese soldiers. The funds previously remitted to Re Tang should be notified to Shanghai and the telegram should be sent to Ping, to be collected by Army Commander Sun Dianying. Reply immediately so that the unit can be notified. Furthermore, Army Representative Zhang Youqun will arrive in Ping today from the front lines and then go to Shanghai. Please contact him upon arrival. All the details will be known. Cishan's abbreviated print."</p>

Some officials guarding the territory have chosen non-resistance, and some have fled without fighting, losing land and cities, causing laughter in all nations. We, who reside in Shanghai, are extremely worried and angry upon hearing the news. Fortunately, Your Excellency has led the troops forward, bravely killing the enemy, adding glory to the nation, and avenging the country.

<h3 id="e84">Wang Yansong Broadcasted a Children's Speech Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Titled "National Mobilization Should Start from One's Own Position"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, Supervisory Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters and Standing Committee Member of the City Chamber of Commerce, was invited by the Zhongxi Pharmacy to broadcast last night. The recorded speech is as follows: Fellow compatriots, today I am here at the invitation of the Zhongxi Pharmacy radio station. My heart is filled with endless sadness and sorrow. Looking out over the Northeast, the mountains and rivers have changed color, and hundreds of millions of compatriots have become aliens. The local people are displaced, unable to live or die. Isn't this the sad state since the September 18th Incident two years ago? The Songhu bloody battle was subjected to trampling. The Zhabei Jiangwan Wusong and other districts became a white land. Isn't this the scar of January 28th? However, the Japanese invaders' ambitions have never diminished. They are still working day and night on their aggressive plans, dreaming of dominating the five continents. Their aggression will not end for a day, and our national crisis will not end for a day. Now Rehe has been lost, and the Gubei Xifeng sentry posts are in fierce battles. It is known that Pingjin Chahar and other places are definitely under pressure. The environment is dangerous and crises are lurking. Everyone knows this. At this time, I am afraid that some people will hold a very pessimistic attitude and say that China is hopeless. At the same time, there must be some people holding a kind of thinking, that is, they can't wait to kill to the northeast and fight the enemy to the death. In fact, a passive attitude and depressed mood cannot save the crisis, but it is also impossible to have the national people go to the front line to pick up the lance to kill the enemy. So, what should we citizens do at this time of national life and death? Our only way out is to advocate ("National Salvation from One's Own Position.") So I specifically chose this topic today ("National Mobilization Should Start from One's Own Position") to talk to everyone. The so-called national mobilization does not mean that every citizen takes a gun and dedicates his life to the frontier, bravely killing the enemy. Its meaning is that every national can start national work and anti-Japanese work from their own position, just to seek its effect, which can be as large as the effect of combat. Can merchants not kill the enemy to save the country? Who says they can't? The merchants' weapon against the enemy is economic severance, which is the anti-goods movement. The merchant's policy for saving the country is to promote industry, revitalize industry, and strive to increase domestic production, in order to seek the prosperity of the social economy. What I hate is that our people have a common problem, that is, they have no persistence, and are regarded by foreigners as a five-minute fever. If our China has been able to resist inferior goods and promote domestic products in a consistent way in recent years, then now I am afraid that we will not suffer this kind of trampling. However, the past is not to be blamed, and the future can be pursued. From now on, I hope that merchants all over the country will work together and bury themselves in their work, not afraid of not having significant effects. Can students not kill the enemy to save the country? Who says they can't? Today's students should know that ("Saving the country requires reading, and reading is saving the country.") Mr. Wu Zhihui once said that everyone should advocate national salvation through machinery at this time of national crisis. Our young students should pay special attention to this sentence. You were born in China with unsound guns and weapons and backward science. If you want to save China, you must deliberately pursue science and study mechanics to manufacture new weapons to prepare for national use, and to breathe a long sigh of relief for the hundreds of thousands of martyrs who sacrificed in the enemy's artillery fire and bombs. This is the expectation of the people of the country for young students to save the country through science. Quickly work hard to create. Workers and farmers can also save the country by working hard from their positions. For example, increasing the quantity of production and enriching the social economy are all elements that contribute to the strength of the country. However, now the worker tide is surging and industry is not prosperous, and workers and capital seem to be unable to coexist and cooperate sincerely. The newspapers every day are filled with reports of strikes at Factory A or disturbances at Factory B. This phenomenon is certainly not a blessing for society. I hope that the workers will be patient for a while, avoid the debate of emotions, and jointly seek to revitalize industry, in order to achieve the goal of enriching the country and benefiting the people. As for the farmers, they should also adopt new methods to increase agricultural products. Our country has always been based on agriculture, but now rice, wheat, and other categories must be purchased from abroad, which is no wonder. On the one hand, we certainly hope that those who are dedicated to the farmer movement can think about how to improve farmers' knowledge and improve their lives. On the other hand, we also hope to introduce new methods from Europe and the United States as much as possible and engage in imitation. I heard that in Western countries, airplanes are used to sow seeds in agricultural affairs. Looking back at our country, artificial sowing is still used. Isn't the difference too far? In short, workers and farmers should now strive to increase various production and enrich the economy. This is the most important part of the national mobilization sound. Speaking of the army, it is extremely important in the country where a strong neighbor is invading the land and losing territory today. A country raises troops for a thousand days and uses them for a day. At this time, it is time for soldiers to be loyal to the country and sacrifice their lives. We hope that the soldiers who lead the troops across the country will kill to the northeast and fight the Japanese invaders to the death. One day, the lost land will be recovered and they will return in triumph. This is the supreme glory of the soldiers. The degree of danger of our country today is like a thousand pounds hanging by a thread. Strive to save the country and do not hesitate any longer. National mobilization, now is the time! I hope that compatriots across the country will grit their teeth and work hard, doing as much as they can and taking as many steps as they can. Don't be discouraged, don't be disappointed, be resolute and brave, always keep in mind the anti-Japanese war, and never forget saving the country in everything. Then, in one or two years, it will not be difficult for China to wash away the past humiliation and enter the ranks of the great powers. Everyone works hard!</p>

It was resolved to send a letter to the National Government Flood Relief Association to request assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e87">New Postage Rate for Nanyang <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>To Be Implemented on May 1st</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the post office's proposed revision of the postage rate for batch letters to Nanyang, a senior official of the Postal Administration stated the following:</p>
<p>Postage to Singapore Has Increased According to reports from the Shantou and Xiamen post offices, the postage for batch letters sent from the Nanyang Islands and the Malayan Federation has increased from 6 Singapore cents to 8 Singapore cents per letter. Inquiries were sent to the Kuala Lumpur Postal Administration to verify, and it was implemented on October 1st of last year. It was found that since the Republic of China 19, our country and the Kuala Lumpur Post Office have been charging half the international postage for Nanyang letters. Now, the Kuala Lumpur Post Office has increased it from 6 Singapore cents to 8 Singapore cents per letter, which is two-thirds of its international postage (12 cents). In normal circumstances, our country can also handle it in the same way, charging two-thirds of the international postage (25 cents) for a national currency of 16.5 cents.</p>
<p>Our Country Still Charges Half According to the Postal Administration, in order to understand the difficulties of overseas Chinese, it is still planned to maintain the principle of charging half the rate, only revising it to 12.5 cents according to the gold franc exchange rate, which is a special preference.</p>
<p>Revised Rate Does Not Increase Burden According to the survey, when overseas Chinese in Nanyang remit money, they mostly prepay the return (ie, reply) postage at the local rate. The current 8 Singapore cents is approximately equal to 16 cents in national currency, which is more than one-quarter higher than the proposed revised postage of 12.5 cents in our country. Therefore, the proposed revision of the postage rate does not actually increase the burden on overseas Chinese themselves or their families, and is very different from ordinary price increases.</p>
<p>Scheduled Implementation of New Rate The post office originally planned to implement the revised rate as soon as possible, but in order to make all parties understand the truth, it had to explain in detail, which led to delays. Now the post office's economy is becoming increasingly short, and since the loss of the Rehe province, it has become even more difficult. This revision plan must be implemented. It is reported that a notice will be issued to collect batch letter postage according to the new rate from May of this year. When the batch letter rate was revised in 19 years, it started on May 1st, so this time it is also planned to be implemented from May 1st, which is seven months later than the two-time fee increase date of Singapore Post. It can be seen that our country's post office is very preferential to batch letters.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Wusong Vehicle Tax Reduced by Two Months <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Wusong city is most lively in spring and autumn. In spring, there is the yellow croaker on the market, and merchants from the interior use rickshaws to transport the yellow croaker to Luodian Baoshan Yuepu Yangxing and other places for sale. In autumn, various villages transport the harvested cotton to Wusong for the market. Therefore, in these two seasons, villagers gather in Wusong, and the Wusong market feels lively. Since the establishment of the levy office in the port by the city's Finance Bureau, this type of rickshaw has been levied according to regulations. However, in order to avoid the levy, merchants and villagers in the interior have changed their routes to other ports. Wusong's commerce has declined since the war last year, and the population has decreased. Recently, due to the disappearance of villagers, the situation has become more desperate. Therefore, the Wusong branch office of the City Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the City Chamber of Commerce, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, which instructed the Municipal Finance Bureau that the tax should be exempted. The municipal government then instructed the finance and public works bureaus to deliberate, and according to the reply, the matters stated by the association were not entirely false. The municipal government then instructed the Municipal Finance Bureau that all vehicle taxes would be temporarily reduced for two months from April of this year, and previous outstanding taxes would be paid according to regulations. All small vehicles that have not been licensed must still be reported to the Wusong Vehicle Office of the Public Works Bureau for registration, and the lead donation certificate must be obtained from the Wusong Vehicle Donation Office of the Finance Bureau every month. Each vehicle is only charged a certificate fee of five points, to show sympathy.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Tragic Accidents at Two Rubber Factories <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The City General Labor Union Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai City General Labor Union, yesterday, regarding the tragic accidents that occurred at the Zhen Tai and Yong He rubber factories, issued a declaration saying, "It has been found that in the past month, the Zhen Tai and Yong He rubber factories experienced unprecedented tragedies due to boiler explosions, resulting in hundreds of male and female workers being injured or killed. The dead had broken hands and feet, scorched heads and faces, a truly unbearable sight. The wails and cries of the grieving families embracing the remains were heartbreaking to hear. According to the investigation conducted by this Union regarding the true cause of the accidents, it was entirely due to the factory's desire to increase productivity, which led them to recklessly operate the boilers beyond their original capacity, resulting in this unfortunate tragedy. In addition, the factory's equipment was rudimentary, which made it impossible for the workers to escape the dangerous situation when the accidents occurred, ultimately leading to their deaths in the inferno. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the factory should bear the responsibility for indirect homicide. However, recent advertisements published by the factories claimed that the post-accident arrangements had been completely resolved. The true situation remains vague, and no definite announcement has been made. For the sake of the lives of the workers, for the safety of the workers in the future, and for the sake of humanity, this Union cannot remain silent. A worker toils with their blood and sweat, working hard to earn a meager wage to support their family. If they suddenly suffer an accident, or become disabled, how will their family survive in the future? Therefore, from a humanitarian standpoint, the factories should find ways to provide generous compensation so that the surviving family members can live out their lives. However, they are now casually settling the matter with a mere few hundred yuan, which not only disregards the livelihoods of the bereaved families but also disrespects the lives of the workers. Therefore, at a minimum, they should act in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law. Secondly, since the cause of this disaster was due to the factory's rudimentary equipment and mismanagement, the factory cannot escape the responsibility for indirect homicide, even if they offer excuses. Furthermore, the personnel responsible for supervising the boilers are the criminals in this case and should not be allowed to go unpunished. Therefore, in addition to providing generous compensation to the families of the deceased, the instigators should be severely punished, brought to justice, to deter future incidents, and to redress the injustice. Thirdly, since these factories caused a tragedy due to negligence, we hope that these factories and other factories will urgently improve their equipment in the future. They must pay close attention to the safety and life protection of the workers, so as to avoid the recurrence of tragic accidents and to value human life. The above three points are the responsibilities of this Union, and we pledge to do our best to fight to the end. We hope that people from all walks of life will stand on the grounds of humanitarianism and impose fair sanctions." This is our declaration.</p>

<p>The Xi Longsheng Case</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Issue of Mother-Son Identity <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Longsheng's Mother is Lonely and Helpless</p>
<p>Continues to Seek Alimony</p>
<p>Xi Longsheng, a prominent paint merchant residing at No. 4 Songshan Road in the French Concession, also known as Xi Shishang, is currently involved in a lawsuit in the First Special District Court with Ms. Huang Zhou, who resides at No. 50 Kangti Road, regarding the issue of their mother-son relationship. Previously, the late paint merchant tycoon Xi Eming and his younger brother Exian jointly established the Rui Kang Paint Company on Shandong Road, which flourished, accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Later, Eming married Ms. Huang, but they had no children for a long time. Ms. Huang, considering herself young, did not allow Eming to take concubines. However, Eming's mother was very eager to have a grandson, so she asked her cook, Li Ruilin from Nanjing, to find a boy for Eming to adopt. At that time, during the Guangxu period, Li Ruilin often went to the Nanjing Road Tie Fangzi vegetable market to buy vegetables, where he met a Suzhou woman named Huang Zhou, who sold bean sprouts. Huang Zhou was pregnant at the time, heavily pregnant, so he told her that his master, Xi's old lady, wanted to adopt a boy for Eming. If she gave birth to a boy, would she be willing to let the Xi family adopt him? Huang Zhou, considering herself still young, already had two sons and a large family to feed, making a living difficult. Moreover, since the Xi family was wealthy, she readily agreed, making an agreement while she was still pregnant. The following year, on January 30th of the thirty-first year of Guangxu, Huang Zhou went into labor and gave birth to a boy at noon. After notifying the Xi family, Eming's female servant, Aqiao, and two other relatives went to Huang Zhou's house that night to take the baby. First, they placed him in a matchmaking shop on Baike Road, where Li Ruilin hired a wet nurse to feed him for three or four months. Later, Eming became seriously ill, so they took the child to ward off bad luck. Eming's illness indeed improved, and Eming was overjoyed, naming him Longsheng. His wife, Ms. Huang, mistakenly believing rumors that her husband had an affair, suspected that Longsheng was born to a mistress, and became very jealous. She once attempted suicide by swallowing gold, but was discovered by her family and rescued. After her aunt explained the adoption in detail, they lived in peace. When Eming passed away, due to the family rule that different surnames cannot disrupt the ancestral lineage, his brother Exian's son was established as the heir. Last year, Longsheng was already twenty-seven years old and married Bei Runsheng's daughter as his wife, and had two sons. After Longsheng was taken away by the Xi family, Huang Zhou's husband, Jinlong, and her two sons died one after another. Lonely and destitute, her life became increasingly difficult. Thinking that she still had one child, who had been taken away, she searched everywhere for Li Ruilin. After half a year, she finally met him on Nanjing Road. Li Ruilin told her that the son who was taken away was Xi Longsheng, who now lives at No. 4 Songshan Road. Huang Zhou was overjoyed, believing that she would have food and clothing from now on and a reliable source of support for the rest of her life. She happily went to the address, but Xi's residence was heavily guarded, and she was stopped by the guards and patrolmen, unable to enter. The iron gate was close at hand, but as distant as clouds in the sky. Huang Zhou had to return disappointed. Later, she went again, but was again turned away and ignored. Helpless, she entrusted Wu Jingxiong, a lawyer, to send a letter requesting alimony, but Longsheng still ignored her. Therefore, in December of the previous year, she reported to the French Concession Police Department and filed a public lawsuit against him in the Second Special District Court for abandonment. Xi Longsheng evaded appearing in court, and his uncle Huang Baohua came forward to mediate, ordering Huang Zhou to first withdraw the lawsuit to facilitate the process. Later, Xi Longsheng gave 15,000 yuan to lawyer Wu to transfer to Huang Zhou, who issued a receipt and took it away. For some unknown reason, Huang Zhou actually received 500 yuan, which was not enough to pay off her debts, so she first entrusted lawyer Ma Hongyuan to send a letter requesting continued alimony, but it was left unanswered for a long time. Then she entrusted lawyers Zhang Shewo and Ma Hongyuan to publish a warning in the newspaper. Xi Longsheng then hired lawyers Li and Qin, and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Huang Zhou for extortion and defamation. The court approved the request, and the eighth courtroom was opened for trial at 3:00 PM on the 16th. Xi Longsheng arrived in court with lawyer Li Zuyu, protected by Chinese and Western bodyguards. Huang Zhou also arrived with her defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhang Shewo, and Ma Hongyuan. Judge Wu Zehan presided over the trial. First, Xi Longsheng stated the reasons for the lawsuit. After being questioned by Judge Wu, Huang Zhou replied that Xi Longsheng was indeed her biological son, who was taken away while still in her womb, and now he refuses to recognize his biological mother and even sues his mother, which is truly a rare occurrence in the world. Then, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhang Shewo, and Ma Hongyuan stood up one after another to state that the previous settlement had flaws and that the defendant would file a lawsuit to confirm the mother-son relationship as a remedy. They requested that the court suspend the trial proceedings in this case. Subsequently, due to the issue of summoning witnesses, the lawyers on both sides had a slight debate. Judge Wu ruled that the witnesses would be summoned to court for questioning next Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Small Kidnapping Case Solved <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Young Victim Jiang Atang Reclaimed</p>
<p>Kidnapping Ring Leader Wang Desheng Captured</p>
<p>Jiang Desheng of the Western District Sino-Foreign Telephone Company, who resides at No. 45 Jianye Lane, Fulvli Road, in the French Concession, was targeted by criminals because he had some savings. Jiang had a son named Atang, who was only six years old. On the afternoon of January 13th, at 3:00 PM, he was playing in the alley and suddenly went missing. They immediately searched everywhere but could not find him, so they reported to the police station and requested an investigation. Soon, they received eight letters from the kidnappers, demanding 15,000 yuan, and they learned that he had been kidnapped. They reported to the police station's special branch. Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with detectives Zhang Ziying, deputy detectives Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, and patrol officers, disguised themselves and went to No. 22 Fuxiang Spinning Society on Guangxi Road, where they arrested two men from Shaoxing, Zhou Liansheng and Zhang Hualang. They also arrested an accomplice, Fei Zhaojun, inside No. 438 on the same road. They confessed that the victim was hidden in the pavilion of No. 30 Wufuli Lane, Tokyo Road, in Huxi. So, at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, they cooperated with Chinese and Western detectives from the Putuo Road police station to crack the case. They rescued the victim and arrested a female guard on the spot, taking them all to the police station for transfer to the court for trial. The family of the victim was notified to retrieve him.

They all claimed that they did not go with Zhang Ayun to cut off the head that night. Wang Zhangshi even hired a lawyer to defend her, but the police lawyer Gan Jingxian argued that the facts of the case were obvious, and the first instance sentenced each defendant to the deserved punishment based on these facts.

<p>Handgun and Expired Permit</p>
<p>Police File Lawsuit</p>
<p>Yu Duxing from Wuxi was a foreman at the Shenxin Flour Mill in Huxi. Recently, given the surge of labor unrest, he felt insecure and wanted to acquire a handgun for self-defense. His friend Ding Xiaokui had a licensed handgun, number 933, and was willing to give it to Yu. They agreed to meet in room 421 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Aiduya Road. At around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yu drove to Zhongnan, and handed Yu a Mauser handgun (without bullets) and a permit. Yu and Rong Bendao, a colleague from the same factory in Wuxi, walked outside, intending to return to the factory. However, they encountered a police inspection team searching pedestrians at the intersection of Haikou Road and Beihai Road. Yu and Rong were also searched, and the handgun and permit were found on Yu. Upon inspection, the name on the permit did not match, and the permit was expired. Yu and Rong were taken to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detective Lang Jintang, patrol officer Wang Jiaju, and Western detective Locke查得得 the name on the permit was Rong Jikang, who received it on June 19th of the Republic of China. 荣纪康确有其人，家住淡水路186号，向营投机事业，故领有手枪执照，嗣因营业失败，乃将枪及执照送赠与丁，由丁转赠予郁，中西探卽往淡水路及申新厂调查，确系事实，惟荣纪康已离沪他往，饬将郁荣二人收押，于昨晨解送第一特区法院，简易庭，捕房律师厉志山，张师竹陈述案情，谓现对两被告以取缔军用枪炮条例第二条及工部局章程第三十七条起诉，惟本案捕房尚须调查，故要求改期第二被告荣本道情节较轻，应请谕令交一般实舖保云云，遂将手枪执照呈案，经黄日昇推事向两被告略讯一过，谕郁收押，荣准交妥保，本案改期七天再讯</p>
<p>He resided at 186 Danshui Road and was involved in speculative businesses, which is why he had a handgun permit. Later, due to business failure, he gave the gun and permit to Ding, who then gave it to Yu. Chinese and Western detectives went to Danshui Road and the Shenxin Factory to investigate, and the facts were confirmed. However, Rong Jikang had already left Shanghai. Yu and Rong were detained and sent to the First Special District Court, Summary Court, yesterday morning. Police lawyers Li Zhishan and Zhang Shizhu presented the case, stating that the two defendants were being prosecuted under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms and Article 37 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Regulations. However, the police station still needed to investigate this case, so they requested a postponement. The second defendant, Rong Bendao, had a lighter case, and it was requested that he be allowed to be released on bail by a general commercial store. The handgun permit was then presented to the court. After Judge Huang Risheng briefly questioned the two defendants, he ordered Yu to be detained and Rong to be allowed to be released on bail. The case was postponed for seven days for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Two Triangular Love Problems <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Mr. He Chao-min and Mr. Yan's Correspondence</p>
<p>To put it briefly: There is a male, A, and a female, B, who have been together for two years, and both families have tacitly acknowledged the possibility of marriage. Recently, female B has fallen in love with male C and disregarded male A. The reason for her change of heart is, of course, that she feels the past was a mistake, that she was blind. Theoretically speaking: once male A knows this, it's best to (give up). Because this kind of thing simply cannot be forced. Unexpectedly, male A has poor judgment and is extremely possessive. Female B, fearing slander because her relationship with male A is already known among family and friends, reluctantly agrees to male A's wish and gets formally engaged. However, she is in great pain in her heart and still cannot forget male C. Male C, on the other hand, is a man who has been through countless hardships, suffering all kinds of experiences and is almost thirty years old. He naturally accepts her passion. However, he doesn't want to embarrass male A. Therefore, he not only doesn't encourage her to move forward but instead tries to help male A and female B restore their old relationship. At the same time, he tells female B, "Let's treat each other as brother and sister from now on, and don't think of anything else." However, female B seems dissatisfied with this implicitly. Sir, in this situation, which path should female B take? Which path should male C take?</p>
<p>Answer: In the reporter's opinion, the happiness of a love triangle probably cannot compensate for the degree of pain, and I very much hope you won't meddle in this kind of trivial matter. Aren't you hearing daily at the telegraph office the alarming news of the fall of Rehe, the loss of Chengde, the imminent danger of Beiping and Tianjin, and the destruction of the country? How can you still have the interest to discuss this kind of problem? As we see it, whether Zhang San is good with her or not; whether Li Si is good with her or not; whether male A is good with female B or not; whether male C is good with female B or not; whether both male A and male C are good with her or not, as long as they have no complaints against each other and each gets what they want, any path is fine. What else is there to discuss? This time, with the fall of Rehe, some people in the Shanghai newspapers blamed Zhang Xueliang, saying he was "(indulging in singing, dancing, and entertainment)". However, without unenterprising citizens who don't sing, dance, and entertain, how could there be such high-ranking officials who indulge in singing, dancing, and entertainment? I hope you will think deeply and wake up!</p>
<p>When I first came to Shanghai, I was introduced to a few female compatriots by friends. Among them were two sisters surnamed Zhu. The elder Zhu and I were classmates and even had the same elective courses, so we had many opportunities to get close. After a semester, we had developed a very good relationship. Once, when it was just the two of us playing in the room, she suddenly brought up some questions about love to discuss with me. At the same time, she frankly expressed her theories about love that she had never talked about with me before. At the time, I didn't feel anything special. Later, I slowly realized that she was very interested, and based on her recent attitude and actions, I could determine that she was signaling to me, challenging me. Driven by curiosity, I subtly revealed a kind of resistant attitude to her. She was already fully prepared, waiting with her bow drawn to the full, and sure enough, it was triggered with a single touch. After that, our friendship gained a component of love. After about another semester, although our love had reached a considerable degree, I always felt somewhat dissatisfied with her: first, she was too quiet, completely lacking a naive and innocent attitude; second, she was two years older than me (according to the physiological age for male and female marriage, the female should be younger than the male). At first, I didn't feel anything, but later I felt distressed everywhere and didn't get any enjoyment from the relationship. If I wanted to reject her, she was always very good to me, and I couldn't bear to reject her because of my feelings. Because our residences were very close, I often met her younger sister when she came to visit her. She (the younger Zhu) was a naive and lively virgin who had just come of age. She was certainly prettier than the elder Zhu, and also very healthy, but her knowledge and experience were not as good as her sister's. At first, I had some ambitions towards her, but because I had developed that kind of relationship with the elder Zhu, I gave up on this idea. However, when I felt that I couldn't continue with the elder Zhu, my old thoughts arose again, and I decided to change my strategy and attack the younger Zhu. Things went very smoothly. As soon as I signaled to her, she indicated her acceptance. However, she already knew about my relationship with the elder Zhu, and at first, she suspected that I wasn't serious. After I explained it to her repeatedly, she believed me. In this way, the younger Zhu and I went from friends to love again. After that, I subtly showed coldness towards the elder Zhu. She was baffled. Then I told her about my relationship with the younger Zhu. She was extremely angry and cried for two days. But she still didn't want to break up with me and instead blamed me for being unfaithful. Later, she often insulted and scolded the younger Zhu and declared that if I married the younger Zhu, she would definitely ask her parents to cut off the younger Zhu's financial support (because their parents loved the elder Zhu more, so she could say this and do it). As I see it: although I am somewhat dissatisfied with the elder Zhu, she is indeed more considerate at times. However, it should be easier to reject her, because our relationship was initiated by her challenging me and me resisting. But I couldn't bear to reject her because of my feelings. On the younger Zhu's side, I was the one who issued the challenge, and I was the one who launched the attack. Since she has accepted my love, of course, I can't let her down, so I might as well marry her. But what if her financial support is really cut off? My finances can't support the needs of two people. So I am really in a dilemma. They are also feeling great pain, and the sisters' relationship is deteriorating day by day. I don't know what to do. Now I propose a few points, and please, sir, be sure to teach me what to do: 1. Should I break off with both of them? Or should I make one of them happy? 2. If I adopt the latter question, which one should I make happy? 3. After making one happy, how should I deal with the other? 4. After making one happy, if the other unfortunately stages a tragedy, what legal responsibility should I bear? 5. Is it reasonable to reject both of them? After rejecting them, how should I handle myself? How should I deal with them?</p>
<p>Answer: Since you developed a relationship with the elder Zhu, you shouldn't have gone on to attack the younger Zhu. Now you have one foot on two boats. Is this a matter for Qi or Chu? It's no wonder it's difficult for you to please everyone. An outsider cannot answer this kind of question for you. It is best to solve it yourself. However, since you have asked, we have no choice but to briefly offer our views as follows: 1. It is best to reject both of them and turn back to focus on your studies. A young man who is trapped in a love net will ruin his life. 2. If you can't reject them both, you must decide who to welcome and who to reject between the two: If you are thinking of yourself, you should still abandon the younger Zhu and take the elder Zhu. Because the elder Zhu was the one who attacked you, and she is two years older than you. She naturally knows this shortcoming. Therefore, her feelings for you must be more sincere and more reliable. Her quietness and taciturnity are not her shortcomings, but her strengths. It is good to be naive and innocent, but precisely because she is naive and innocent, she is also easily swayed. (You can't have both). Give up the fish and take the bear's paw.) Do you think so?</p>

<p>Establishes a Public Radio Listening Post</p>
<p>Address: Community Education Center</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to promote continuing education, has established a radio broadcasting tutorial class. Its purpose is to enable people scattered in all directions to freely listen to lectures on the radio, thereby helping them to supplement their knowledge and skills in their spare time. At the beginning of the program, quite a few people signed up to learn. Now it is learned that ordinary commercial firms and factories, due to financial constraints, cannot purchase radio receivers for the time being, so that ordinary employees and apprentices, even if they are interested in learning, have no means to receive education, and many sigh with frustration. There are many people who are unable to do so. Therefore, a radio receiver has been installed in the lecture hall of the Community Education Center in Wenmiao, South Shanghai, as a public radio listening post. The scope of radio reception is limited to the three programs (Citizenship), (National Language), and (English) broadcast by the bureau's radio broadcasting tutorial class. Every evening from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. is the public listening time. All students who have registered for the bureau's radio tutorial class can present their learning certificate and go to listen on time.</p>

<p>Qingzhong Wins the School Group Championship</p>
<p>Runner-Up Nanshang Third Seagull</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Group: Eagle Team and White Team Scheduled to Determine the Winner</p>
<p>Last night's Central Qing basketball room was unusually lively. Nanshang and Qingzhong, two strong teams, entered the field to compete. However, Nanshang's team had Chu Changhui and others from Fudan going to Beijing to participate in the Jiangnan competition, so the lineup was changed. After the start of the game, Nanshang's momentum was fierce, and Qingzhong found it difficult to resist. Especially Nanshang's Xu Jiashi's long throws were even more terrifying. On the scoreboard, it was 10 to 3. Qingzhong saw that the situation was not good, and Yang Longxing entered the field to compete despite his illness. The defense was thus strengthened, and the forwards were also active. In the first half, they took the lead with 14 to 13. After the break, Nanshang's lineup was very loose, resulting in a slump. The players' movements were also abnormal, with frequent fouls. Qingzhong's center also had four personal fouls, resulting in him being sent off. As a result, Qingzhong defeated Nanshang 36 to 26. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingzhong　Pos　Fouls　Points　Nanshang Pos　Fouls　Points</p>

<p>After 8 PM, the White Team and Eagle Team entered the field. Each team had a general who could not come to compete. However, Eagle Team's Kong Guangyi still maintained his afterglow from the National Games. Especially the big fat man Dai Changling, the second number from the police, made people laugh even more. The girls from Nanshang kept talking non-stop. In the first half, the Eagle Team led 26 to 12. After the lemon break, the White Team changed its strategy and led the way. It was a tie. The difference was always one point. Later, Eagle Team's Kong Guangyi scored a goal, winning the victory. The score was 42 to 41. As a result, each team had two wins and two losses, with no clear winner. It is scheduled to hold the final decisive battle next Wednesday (the 22nd).</p>

<p>The China Swimming Research Association, which founded the Wenyong Swimming Pool and actively promotes swimming, in view of the fact that the National Games have been decided to be held on Double Tenth Festival, only six months from now, if it does not gather talents and actively train, it will not be successful.

<h3 id="e160">Only Hear the Escalator Sounding <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>No One Seen Coming Down</p>
<p>"Only hear the escalator sounding, no one seen coming down," these are two local sayings of us Suzhou people, also symbolizing the emptiness of us Suzhou people. Unexpectedly, these two sentences, by this time, have a great effect of changing customs, empty-headedness, prevailing globally, empty-headedness, lasting for thousands of years.</p>
<p>After September 18th, China and Japan dragged and pulled each other to Geneva. At that time, that old League of Nations gentleman, with his beard standing on end, slammed the gavel with a thunderous sound, saying that the violent Japan must be sanctioned. From then on, until now, the Japanese demonstrate once to the old League of Nations gentleman, and the old League of Nations gentleman also demonstrates once. But the old League of Nations gentleman, despite repeatedly rising in anger, still sits motionless. The escalator keeps sounding, but people still don't come down.</p>
<p>On January 28th, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army resisted Japan. The Japanese army dispatched the 横一師團 and 竪一師團 divisions, and the Chinese people looked forward to the arrival of reinforcements from all sides day and night, to resist the strong enemy. So when it was heard that a certain army had arrived in Suzhou, and a certain army had arrived in Wuxi, although defending outside the 30th and 40th defense lines, everyone was excited and danced with joy. Who knew that such news kept coming, and until the Chinese army retreated to 20 miles away, the troops standing on the front line and in the rear never saw a face from another army. The escalator sounded really solid, consistent from beginning to end, but no reinforcements came.</p>
<p>National crisis, national crisis, has now been a year and a half, spending days and nights enduring hardships, recovering lost territory, but now the national crisis remains like a vast land. Whether the established policy is long or short-term, has never been revealed. The sound of the escalator is like someone is coming down, but unfortunately, no one has come down in the end.</p>
<p>"Only hear the escalator sounding, no one seen coming down," may become a kind of cosmopolitanism in the future, and my Suzhou emptiness has glory in it.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Poison of Words <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>To live one's life based on the position of books, thinking oneself to be perfectly reasonable, will inevitably lead to a dead end. This is something I have learned from experience, and perhaps modern youth feel the same pain. Originally, learning is learning, experience is experience, the best students in school are not necessarily the great men of society in the future; the great men in society, even though they are inferior students in school; the saying that education does not create talents, I cannot accept.</p>
<p>Words are originally a sharp weapon for killing genius. At the same time, people who know how to read and understand reason are also an obstacle in the philosophy of life. If we don't read, know how to read, and understand reason, living muddleheaded, eating when hungry, and shitting when full, only knowing how to make money and get rich, regardless of cruel means and despicable behavior; flattering, bragging, crawling through dog holes, wagging our tails and begging for mercy, flattering and smiling obsequiously, only seeking to achieve the purpose of making money and getting rich, how can we care about the filthiness of the means? This is not necessarily scolding them for being shameless, in fact, their brains only contain the four words (make money and get rich), so their behavior is like this.</p>
<p>Friends who read books have many theories deeply engraved in their minds, such as Mozi's doctrine of universal love, Laozi's doctrine of non-action, the Buddhist view of emptiness in all things, as well as the Jin people's wild and reckless behavior, the Song Confucian's rectification of the heart and sincerity of intention, Tao Yuanliang, Bai Juyi, Shao Yaofu, Lu Fangweng's reclusion, Sima Xiangru, Cao Zijian, Yuan Wei, Hou Chaozong, Mao Pijiang's unrestrainedness; putting many theories into a small brain, thinking that one has mastered ancient and modern knowledge and is full of learning, how can one know that in the eyes of modern fashionable friends, is it not a person who has gone insane?</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to enable our children and grandchildren to stand firm in modern society in the future, to have food to eat, clothes to wear, become great men, and make a fortune, never let them read books, never let them know how to read. Understanding the principles of the book temple will make one ignorant of the principles of eating and making a fortune. After all, a person is born into the world, eating is important, making a fortune is important, never be poisoned by (the poison of words), this is a sentence of experience from me, I respectfully advise you all to remember!</p>

<p>Chapter Two</p>
<p>A humble room makes for fragrant neighbors, secretly admiring the healthy old man. The Quan family chooses a good match, vehemently criticizing the poor child.</p>
<p>Guizhi smiled and said: "That's not necessarily true, I've heard of girls who don't leave home until they're a hundred years old!" It's really a coincidence in the world, just as Guizhi was saying a few words, Brother Ku Er across the street happened to come. Guizhi expected that the last sentence would definitely be heard by someone, and for some reason, her face turned red for a while. It was Brother Gan Er who spoke first, saying: "It's getting lively here, another neighbor has moved in." Guizhi said: "There are very few people in Company Commander Zhao's family, just his old man and a servant. Company Commander Zhao himself doesn't come home." Brother Gan Er smiled and said: "How can a soldier live at home? However, it's very close to his camp from here, and he can come home every day during the day, which is fine," as he looked Guizhi up and down. Although his words seemed very ordinary, the tone of his voice was inevitably barbed. Without saying anything, he gave her a slight glance, and then said: "Brother Er, are you here to pick up your clothes? They're not ready yet, they'll be done tomorrow." Brother Gan Er agreed with a "okay" and immediately went back. Jiang didn't care, and went about her business. Only Guizhi felt a little uncomfortable in her heart, feeling that moving in such a neighbor in the same courtyard inevitably offended a neighbor across the street. So, in her heart, she warned herself that she should go to the Zhao family's courtyard less often in the future, so as not to cause any trouble. Therefore, Guizhi only worked on the kang that afternoon and didn't go out. However, the Zhao family's servant kept coming, asking where to buy coal and where to call for water, coming a total of more than ten times. In the evening, the servant brought a large plate of hot steamed buns, saying that they were for Old Lady Yang. Jiang said to Guizhi: "This must be that old man feeling that he troubled us too much today, so he sent some things to return our favor, the old man is really polite." Guizhi said: "We thought that people who are military officers must be unreasonable, but judging from this, they're not bad." Jiang said: "That's right, I have to go see them tomorrow morning." Guizhi said: "Our neighbors are all pretty good, look, isn't the Gan family across the street very good too?" Jiang wanted to say something to her, saying that no matter what you say, you can't forget the Gan family, but then she thought that if she said this, the girl would be unhappy, so she held back and didn't say anything more.

<h3 id="e164">Obituary <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>The usual beginning of an obituary says: (The unfilial, burdened with sin, could not bring themselves to perish┋┋). However, when parents are alive, they are often made to feel hurt, angry, and to suffer. Once they pass away, it is grandly written (Burdened with sin, could not bring themselves to perish, disaster extends┋┋) to inform distant relatives and friends, in an attempt to absolve oneself of guilt. However, given the reality, can one really deceive others just by admitting to the weight of their sins? Then it goes on to say: (The deceased was bestowed the title of First Rank Official┋┋). The Qing Emperor has long since vanished. Why still refer to someone as a First Rank or Second Rank Lady┋┋? Even if one achieved the title of Special Rank Lady, what glory is there in that?</p>
<p>It also says: (The unfilial ones are employed at the Provincial Government, studied abroad, and upon hearing the news, rushed back by electric dispatch that very night). This is merely to show that your two young masters are high officials and foreign PhDs. That your sons could rush back that very night is considered filial piety, enough to make you smile in your grave. But whether the night had shining stars or torrential rain is unknown to outsiders. However, with convenient transportation today, with trains and airplanes going back and forth, even rushing back on a snowy night is not painful!</p>
<p>The end is still laden with lonely orphans, mourning sons, heavy mourning, light mourning, shedding blood, bowing reverently, wiping tears and kowtowing┋┋. If everyone truly squeezed out bright red blood from their eyes, that would be terrifying. If parents have kind hearts, even in eternal sleep, they would not wish their children and grandchildren to do such a thing!</p>
<p>Some can't wait for their parents to die so they can divide the inheritance. At that time, they won't shed blood, they won't even shed a single tear! In the end, is it about saving face or striving for glory while alive? In short, obituaries should eliminate falsehood and adopt a new style. They can also represent whether society is progressing, so they are worth promoting and improving!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e165">Nine-Flavor Tea <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>Students always feel that teachers are somewhat mysterious. Is this a religious effect?</p>
<p>Law is recognized by society as the most powerful thing. As long as it is legal, there is nothing wrong with it. However, judging from the matter of marriage, it seems to require many conditions beyond the law.</p>
<p>At wedding banquets or when teasing the newlyweds, the most enthusiastic and excited ones are always unmarried young men! Admiration, jealousy, and curiosity condense into a thick and intense feeling at this time. As for married people, they mostly express indifference in such situations. Women, as a rule, are unwilling to express anything.</p>
<p>Young people often have abundant energy, while older people often lack it. Those with abundant energy naturally have a strong urge to vent it, and they do so to the fullest when they have the opportunity. Rushing about, laughing, and joking are all expressions of young people venting their excess energy. Those with insufficient energy remain still and inactive, even feeling disgusted when they see others active, and if it is within their power, they may even forbid or prevent it. Therefore, people who are too far apart in age and do not understand each other cannot get along.</p>
<p>In Japan, the way Japanese people pass the time when riding the train is by reading newspapers and magazines. In Shanghai's trams, although there are also a few people reading newspapers, there are very few. They seem to each have their own boredom, each have their own feelings. The only pastime for male passengers is to stare at young and beautiful female passengers.</p>
<p>Time can cause people to develop feelings and relationships. Because the time spent on the tram is often so short, it is not easy for passengers to develop good feelings or relationships with each other. Sometimes they may exchange a few words, but they are all insignificant or even contain suspicion. The situation is closer and it is easier for people to develop a sense of community on long-distance trains or ships.</p>
<p>In the area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai railways, you can see many pines and cypresses and tombs. These pines and cypresses and tombs seem to depend on each other for survival. It is not known whether earthen tombs were built because there were pines and cypresses, or whether pines and cypresses were planted because there were tombs.

<h3 id="e166">From Commercialization to Education <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Jin</p>
<p>In the development of radio broadcasting, it can be divided into two periods. The first is the (commercialization) period, and the second is the (education) period. Only when the second period is reached does radio have true value for the public, and at the same time, radio itself can develop.</p>
<p>Currently, radio (commercialization) has reached its peak. The low price of radios makes them widely available to purchasers. Among those who install radios, stores are the largest majority, especially stores in urban areas, almost all of which have this new type of decoration. When you walk through bustling streets, in addition to the sounds of cars and trams, the loud music coming from the radio speakers of shops on both sides will make your ears deaf, and sometimes it will make you stop and listen. The radio itself has become the most fashionable advertising tool. If you own a radio, you can listen to the programs broadcast by various broadcasting stations continuously from morning to night. If you record what you hear, you will find a large amount of advertising. Whether it is in (storytelling with music), (songs), (folk tunes), or even in solemn speeches, almost all contain advertising components.</p>
<p>This situation is unavoidable in countries where the radio industry is still in its infancy, especially in countries where radio is commercialized. But I believe that one day this situation will end. In the future, the price of radios will be even lower, and more people will install them. At the same time, broadcasting stations will transition from (commercialization) to (popularization). At that time, the programs broadcast will change greatly with the renewal of public awareness. Many meaningless advertising programs will disappear, and in their place will be subjects that impart knowledge and entertainment that cultivates temperament. At that time, the radio industry will reach the (education) period, which is when it will have true value.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Ground Rod Resistance <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao You</p>
<p>The resistance of the ground wire has a significant relationship to radio reception. This is something everyone has experienced. The usual method of grounding is to drive an iron or copper rod into the ground. This type of grounding is very convenient because it is easy to operate, the wiring can be done on the ground, and it can be driven deep into the ground to maintain moisture permanently.</p>
<p>This grounding method is most ideal if the length of the iron rod can reach the underground moisture layer (Moisture Level). This moisture layer varies depending on the geology of each location, but is mostly at a depth of eight to nine feet. If inserted shallowly, the resistance increases.</p>
<p>The above diagram shows the relationship between the depth of the ground rod and the resistance. From this diagram, it can be seen that the depth of the ground rod must be at least four feet.</p>
<p>In addition, the size, area, and number of ground rods are also related, but they are not very important. Also, even if there are many rods, if the distance between them is not more than three feet, the effect is even less. Beyond four rods, the efficiency cannot be increased any further.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Temporary Repair Method for Broken Headphone Wire <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— VT</p>
<p>If the headphone wire is broken on the outside, it can be replaced with ordinary lamp wire without any difficulty. But if the internal coil is broken, it is not easy to repair the break yourself. Now there is a temporary solution. First, observe which coil is broken, and then connect the two ends of the broken coil together. Because there are often two coils inside the headphone, even if one is broken, the other can still be used. As shown in the figure, ABBC are the two coils inside the headphone. Assuming that the right coil is broken internally, then simply connect one end A to the point B where the two coils are connected with a wire, as shown by the dotted line. It will only sound slightly weaker.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Homemade Electromagnetic Phono Cartridge <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhi</p>
<p>Using an old headphone and some parts from a record player, you can make your own electromagnetic phono cartridge for testing audio frequency amplifiers (Audio Amplifier) and modulator systems (Modulator System).</p>
<p>The inside of the headphone does not need to be changed, just open a small hole in the back so that it can be mounted on a movable arm with a screw. As shown in the figure, connect the needle (Stylus) from the record player to the edge of the headphone, and weld the upper end to the center of the vibration diaphragm (DIAPh)ragm). The two ends of the electric wire inside the headphone are connected to the amplifier.</p>
<p>The arm for placing the cartridge is made of a long strip of brass. The screw connecting it to the cartridge should not be too tight, so that the cartridge can rotate freely on the turntable. At the other end, the support can be made of a brass tube, and a screw inserted into it to fix it to the base of the record player.</p>
<p>The frequency response of this cartridge is similar to that of ordinary headphones. Because its impedance (Linpedance) is extremely high, it is best used directly in the grid circuit of the first audio frequency amplification tube, or it can be passed through an ordinary amplification transformer.

<p>— KP</p>
<p>The discoverer of electromagnetic relations</p>
<p>Andre-Marie Ampere was French, born in Riom in 1775. His mathematical genius was evident in his early years. He did not have specialized study in science until after he married in 1799, when he specialized in the science necessary for educators in order to make a living. Throughout his life, his academic achievements were indeed quite great, and he made extraordinary contributions to the progress of science, especially in applying mathematical analysis to electromagnetic problems. In this respect, it is no exaggeration to call him a pioneer of radio. His research results seem to have paved the way for the later British physicist Michael Faraday (1791-1867). After hearing about Oersted's discovery, he immediately began experiments. In 1820, he had already established the law concerning the movement of a magnetic needle with the direction of the current, and later discovered extremely important phenomena such as the fact that coils have magnetic force when current is flowing through them. He died in 1836.</p>

<p>(3) Electron Flow - Electric Current</p>
<p>The electric lights, telephones, telegraphs, electric stoves, etc. that we use every day all utilize electric current. As mentioned above, radio waves are also generated by the vibration of electric current. So, what exactly is electric current? We must first understand this.</p>
<p>According to recent scientists' research, any substance is composed of only two things: one is called an electron (Electron), and the other is called a nucleus (Nucleus). Electrons revolve around the nucleus in various numbers. The situation is similar to the Earth and planets revolving around the sun. Because of the different numbers of electrons, various kinds of atoms are formed. Any molecule or atom has a fixed number of electrons. It cannot have one more or one less. If it loses one, it must use great force to replenish it. If it has one more, it cannot be stable and must get rid of it. No matter how far away, as long as there is a path, they will quickly link together to make up for deficiencies. The speed of their movement is almost the speed of light. This is how electric current is formed.</p>
<p>When a substance has more electrons, it develops a special property called negative electricity, also called negative charge; when it lacks electrons, it also develops a special property called positive electricity, also called positive charge. The electron is the smallest thing in the world, and its mass is only about one eighteen-hundredth of that of a light atom. It often exists in large numbers in various metals, called free electrons. These electrons all have a negative charge, and usually move freely within the metal body, scattered without a fixed direction. But once they come into contact with something with a positive charge, they flow endlessly towards it to combine with it. (Electrons repel each other.) After combining, they no longer function. This is called neutralization. Therefore, if we want to generate electric current, we just need to find a way to make the electrons inside the metal body move. For example, if we apply voltage to both ends of a metal wire, the electrons will flow in a certain direction, forming an electric current. However, the direction of the current generally referred is exactly opposite to the direction of electron flow. It is said that current flows freely from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. Any metal body or other substance that easily conducts electric current is called a conductor.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the electric current is the amount of electrons or charged molecules (such molecules are scientifically called ions (Ion)) flowing. The amount of this flow depends on the needs at the two ends of the conductor and the ease of flow. This can also be compared to water. Fill a bottle with water and open a hole at the bottom, connecting a tube. The water will flow out of the tube. If the water level in the bottle is very high, then the water flow will be rapid and large. This is because a high water pressure means a large water flow. Also, if the hole or the connected tube has a larger diameter, then the resistance decreases, and the water flow increases. The same is true for electric current. The needs are explained by the word voltage (Voltage). A high voltage will cause the current to increase. At the same time, if the resistance to current flow is high, for example, if the conductor is a thin wire or other substance that does not easily conduct electricity, then the current decreases. This is called resistance (Resistance).</p>
<p>The relationship between these three factors, current, voltage, and resistance, can be defined by Ohm's law. This will be discussed later.</p>

<p>— Jun</p>
<p>(1) Unit of Current Intensity</p>
<p>The quantity that expresses the degree of strength of an electric current is called current intensity. The unit of current intensity is called ampere (Ampere). The value of one ampere is the current intensity of a constant current that, when passed through a silver nitrate solution, can deposit 0.001118 grams of silver per second.</p>
<p>There are two other units for measuring smaller currents:</p>
<p>(Symbol mA) = one thousandth of an ampere</p>
<p>(Symbol uA) = one hundred thousandth of an ampere</p>
<p>Current is often represented by the letter 丨 in formulas.</p>
<p>(2) Unit of Electric Charge</p>
<p>Electric currents have strengths, due to the number of electric charges passing through the wires per second. This number of electric charges is called electric charge. The unit of electric charge is called coulomb (Coulomb), and its value is the amount of electric charge that one ampere of current passes through any cross-section of a wire in one second. Electric charge is represented by the letter Q in formulas.</p>
<p>One coulomb contains 6.29 io i8 electrons. Therefore, in practice, one ampere is the rate of flow of 6.29 io i8 electrons passing through a point in a circuit per second.</p>
<p>A larger unit of electric charge is called (ampere-hour). One ampere-hour is equal to 3600 coulombs.</p>

<h3 id="e175">My Homemade Single-Tube Radio <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Ming</p>
<p>I admit I am a not-so-ambitious radio enthusiast. Now everyone tends towards AC power, while I still linger with DC; now everyone is expanding to three or four tubes, while I still stick to a single tube. I am becoming more and more outdated, but I have also evolved: from the non-power-consuming crystal radio to the slightly power-consuming single-tube radio.</p>
<p>During the (broadcasting era of the Kairo Company), I curiously made a crystal radio to play with, but being naturally restless, I kept dismantling and tinkering with it, considering it research. Finally, because it was only a crystal radio, it could not satisfy my curiosity, so I resolved to make a single-tube radio. At first, I didn't achieve much, but later, after disassembling and reassembling, modifying left and right, and working diligently on the single-tube radio for several years, I actually came up with a method that I considered satisfactory. It was just that I myself felt satisfied. As for whether the method is reasonable or not! Or even if it is already very outdated and not worth a look from experts, that is unknown. But what is worth boasting about is: easy to manufacture, economical, long reception range, and pleasing sound.</p>
<p>Now, let's publish the circuit diagram as follows:</p>
<p>The above method is said to be regenerative, that is, it has two stages of amplification, high frequency and low frequency. The materials used are very ordinary. If you are just starting out, you should first purchase the following items:</p>
<p>One UX201A vacuum tube</p>
<p>One Ux vacuum tube socket</p>
<p>Two ·00035 capacitors</p>
<p>One 25 resistor</p>
<p>One 5:1 variable condenser</p>
<p>One fixed crystal (with mount) (I used Carboraindum)</p>
<p>One roll of #24 double silk-covered wire</p>
<p>Four binding posts</p>
<p>One 6VA storage battery</p>
<p>One 90V B battery</p>
<p>One 4.5V C battery</p>
<p>Two three-inch dials</p>
<p>One spiderweb coil frame (with board)</p>
<p>Three feet of connecting wire</p>
<p>One 4000-ohm headphone (I used Telefunken)</p>
<p>One hundred feet of antenna wire</p>
<p>Forty or fifty feet of ground wire (rubber insulated wire)</p>
<p>One piece of bakelite</p>
<p>One baseboard</p>
<p>Several round-head screws</p>
<p>One small wooden box</p>
<p>Two antenna insulators</p>
<p>Now let me tell you how to make my single-tube radio:</p>
<p>First, wind 60 turns of #24 double silk-covered wire (Li) on the spiderweb coil frame, then add another 20 turns (L) outside the Li coil on the same board. Wind the regenerative coil (12) on another spiderweb board, also with twenty turns. Then, according to the above two diagrams, connect the wires according to the diagram. The shorter the wiring, the better, and the arrangement should be neat and beautiful.</p>
<p>After all the wiring is completely in place, you should first check whether the wiring is incorrect, especially paying attention to the incorrect connection of the A and B batteries. If it is completely correct, good results are guaranteed. Because this machine uses a crystal detector and a 201A amplifier, it is perfectly suitable.</p>
<p>However, it may be that due to slight differences in location and wiring procedures, the sound reception efficiency may be reduced (or it may even be strengthened, it's hard to say), which should be taken into account by the assembler. If you feel that the reception range is not far enough, the detection is not sensitive, or the sound reception is noisy, you can raise or shorten the antenna, or add a ·10000 variable capacitor in the antenna circuit; if the regeneration is too strong, you can separate the Lx12 coils very far. These should naturally follow general rules.</p>
<p>Later, I changed the A battery of this machine to AC power. Although the results were worse than DC, it saved a lot of trouble such as charging. Let me talk about it next time when I have the opportunity.</p>

<p>The Gold Market in a State of Stability</p>
<p>Rumors Fail to Stir Up a Storm; A Common Drop of Five Dollars and Twenty Cents</p>
<p>Although the gold market has declined, the trend is extremely calm. In the early morning, due to foreign news from London, both near-term and far-term prices rose by 1.2125. New York silver prices rose by 75, British-American exchange rates rose by .625, American-British exchange rates rose by .9375, and far-term silver prices rose by 1 to 3%, showing an extremely firm trend. American cotton also jumped up more than 50 points, while the wool market immediately fell, initially quoted within ten dollars, but due to strong demand, it gradually rose. The morning opened at 1016.5 yuan, and the exchange market also opened firm, but not too excessive. Buyers were extremely active, initially struggling around 20 yuan. Later, due to the better exchange market, HSBC and others accepted June US dollars at 31.25 yuan for 22 yuan, struggling multiple times. The market situation was extremely calm. Finally, a sudden drop occurred because the exchange market was firmer, and June US dollars at 31.3125 yuan were difficult to sell. There were also rumors in the market of American purchases of silver, causing it to fall to 1015 yuan. The midday close was 1015.5 yuan. The afternoon initially stabilized and then rose, opening at 1014.5 yuan. Initially, it was quiet, with Bombay reporting a rise of 3.3.4 points. At this time, it hovered around 4 yuan, but unexpectedly, after a long period of mediocrity, a favorable sign appeared, and buyers rushed in. The exchange market was also tight, with HSBC grabbing April US dollars at 1875, showing an excellent trend, and the environment gradually became brighter, rising more than 10 yuan, and once rising to 1025.2 yuan. The closing was 1025 yuan. It can be seen that the entire market was extremely mediocre. Although there were rumors, there were no special changes, and people's hearts were stable. The price of pure silver was increased by 38 yuan in the market, and the spread for deferred delivery has fallen to within 30 yuan. Spot traders are selling out, and there are rumors that the central government is also releasing silver. The market situation during the day is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1016.5 yuan, a drop of 13.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 1017 yuan. The exchange market also opened firm, with the near-term British exchange rate quoted at 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 8125, and the US dollar at 30 yuan, 125. However, due to internal demand, it rose to around 9 yuan. Shen Kang also accepted it, breaking through to 20 yuan, or 21 yuan. Qian Changxiang sold out, causing it to fall to within 20 yuan, to 18.5 yuan. Yuan Maoyong came to buy again, pulling it back to 22 yuan. The exchange market was also tight, and the general trend fluctuated. Hengyu went up and sold, immediately dropping 4 yuan, to 18 yuan. Daxing was keen to make a deal for 21.5 yuan. Huabi and Shanghai both filled June US dollars at 31.25 yuan. Yuankangxiang sold it for 19 yuan. Daxing Yong made another deal, pushing it up to 22 yuan again. HSBC posted a price on the board, calculating a rise of 25 shillings and an increase of half a yuan for the US dollar, gradually retreating and falling to within 20 yuan. Hengyu sold again for 19.5 yuan. HSBC took June US dollars at 25 and grabbed April shillings at 8125. Fuyu bought the deal, still at around 22 yuan, and the situation was extremely calm and fluctuating. Zhaofengchang sold it, falling to within 20 yuan. June US dollars at 25 were difficult to sell. Ruixing took advantage of the situation to sell the deal, falling to 18 yuan, but there was much struggle, and the market situation did not change much. Before long, Mitsui grabbed June US dollars at 25, which was filled by the Dalian gang. Fuyu slightly accepted it in the market and raised it to 21.5 yuan. Yuankangxiang still sold the deal, retreating to within 20 yuan. Huabi sold April US dollars at 25. Zhaofengchang sold it again, falling to 18.3 yuan. HSBC ate June exchange rates at 25 and still saw it pulled up. At this time, it fluctuated around 20 yuan for a very long time, and the trend was very ordinary. After a long delay, the exchange market turned firm. June US dollars at 25 were not needed by anyone. Hengyu sold it repeatedly, falling to around 7 yuan. The banks' appetite worsened, and June US dollars at 31.25 were also not easy to sell. Zhifeng Yong, Xiexing Yong, Fushun, and others sold them one after another. By this time, it was close to closing, and buyers saw the overwhelming momentum and remained on the sidelines. Although there were few transactions, they still fell to 1015 yuan. Before long, the midday close was 1015.5 yuan, and the goods were also priced the same.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was at 1.14.5 yuan, and the goods opened at 4.4 yuan. Initially, it was extremely calm, fluctuating one or two cents. The exchange market still showed slackness, and June US dollars at 375 were not easy to sell, falling from 5.2 yuan to 3 yuan. Huabi grabbed June US dollars at 4375, and Zhifeng Yong entered the deal, which was raised higher, to 5.9 yuan. Magalhaes also grabbed July US dollars at 75. Zhifeng Yong suddenly sold slightly, and it fluctuated and retreated to 4 yuan. At this time, it was extremely calm. Banks made many deals in July US dollars, with Sassoon selling out and being taken by Datong. Similar trades were also sold to Zhongfu in the same industry, all at 75. The gold market was also extremely calm, hovering within 5 yuan. Bombay telegraphed a large rise of 3 annas, and it fell to 3.5 yuan. After this, things took a turn for the better, and the market recovered. Heng Shouxin advanced to 5 yuan. Zhaofengchang also accepted it, to 7 yuan. Spot goods were sold for hedging, retreating to 6.2 yuan. But the mood had already improved, and Dadecheng went up to buy, still pulling it to above 7 yuan. Zhaofengchang and Hengyu accepted even more, rising to above 20 yuan. Huabi ate June US dollars at 25, and Fuchang eagerly entered the deal, adding up to 22 yuan. Daxing Yong and Fuyu also came to buy, so it went up to 24.5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong came to sell out, gradually retreating to 20.05 yuan. HSBC grabbed April US dollars at 25 again, and then rose to 23 yuan. Spot goods were sold out for 1.3 yuan. At this time, the upward trend was firmly established, and buyers were extremely excited, but there were few transactions. June US dollars required 1875. HSBC also accepted April US dollars at 30.1875. Hengyu and others' buying interest did not diminish, raising it to 5 yuan. Yuan Maoyong solicited sales, falling by more than 1 yuan. At this time, it was close to closing, and there were more buyers. The exchange market was also good. Although there were few transactions, it was still able to rise to 20.2 yuan. Before long, the closing was at 1025 yuan, with spot goods slightly higher, priced at 5.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 1025.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 1.13 yuan, with only a difference of 12.2 yuan. The trend was stable, and the result was a drop of 5.2 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price, due to HSBC's listing of the US exchange rate at half a yuan, was calculated at 29.625 yuan. The alloy price was 1124.88 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 99 yuan, which was about 14 yuan less than the previous close. The morning registration included 1,41 yuan for this month, 1041 yuan for April, 1016 yuan for May, and 1041 yuan for water replenishment.

Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, Yuankangxiang, Changxing Yong, Fushun, and others were all sellers. Yuanheng Dadecheng bought odd lots. Zhaofengchang and Qian Changxiang initially sold and then slightly bought back. Large-scale inflows and outflows throughout the city were rarely seen. There were few transactions by the Dalian gang and the Guangdong gang. As of yesterday, there were a total of 17,045 new May transactions, which was much less than the previous period.</p>
<p>The price of pure silver was low yesterday due to the low deferred delivery price, so it also tended to be cheap, calculated at an increase of 38 yuan. In the market, Yingfeng Heng and Dafeng Heng made a flat deal with each other. After that, it was extremely calm. Out-of-town gangs such as the Jiangxi gang were slightly stagnant in their arrival and tended to replenish their positions, opening at 40 yuan, but there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>The deferred delivery price was lower. Initially, Kongfang Dadecheng paid Yingfeng Heng 27.25 yuan for April and May (equivalent to 19.5 taels of silver). Spot dealers such as Tongfeng Heng were also willing to sell, so it decreased to 27 yuan, with Dadecheng paying for 70 deals. Then another 70 deals, again for 26.5 yuan. 21 deals for April were allocated from Runchangyu to Dadecheng, priced at 1050 yuan, and another 259 deals were allocated to Hengxing, priced at 1065 yuan, for April allocation transactions.

But after this, there was a surge in demand for this price. Only 217 March deals remained.

<p>35 March government bonds were released by Yingfeng Heng, and 7 bonds by Yongfeng. 14 bonds were collected and released by Runchangyu, Dashun, and Dafeng Heng, for a total of 42 bonds.</p>

<p>Government Bond Market Remains Weary</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw erratic fluctuations in the government bond market, entirely dependent on the supply and demand relationship between the long and short sides. The situation remained the same. Only the Northern gang consistently sold frantically, so the market price both rose and fell again. After rising twice, it retreated again, and the market situation was inevitably dim. In the morning opening, the No. 11 military expenditure bonds and subsequent items were all sold off. The various items listed earlier were all pressed down by 2 to 6 or 7 jiao. Although the Northern gang sold, the quantity was still small. For the No. 20 Guan far-term bonds, there were gradually more takers. After all, the bulls had the advantage, and it rebounded by 1 to 4 jiao. In the second round, the Northern gang sold even more, but with strong buying from scattered takers, the market price was sold higher and higher, rebounding by 1 to 6 jiao. However, the salt tax still proved weak and tended to be tired. In the afternoon, the Northern gang still had a large number of sales of the No. 14 and No. 34 bonds, down 1 to 7 jiao at the start, but the salt tax was down only 1 jiao, because the Nos. 36, 38, and 47 bonds were all in demand. The closing was stable, with ups and downs of only 1 or 2 jiao. There were no rumors in the market, and people's hearts were still stable. Major bullish holders were steadfast as before. As a result, the market price continued to fall by 2 or 3 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao, except for the No. 18 Guan, which was slightly better by 5 fen. The total transaction volume was 10.0997 million yuan, of which only 2,000 yuan was spot, and futures, including salt tax, accounted for more than 4.5 million, military reduction for 1.73 million, and over 2.3 million for the Nos. 20, 20 Guan.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports: Thursday (16th), the New York stock market initially opened strong, and trading was also quite active. The ticker was once 8 minutes behind. In the afternoon, buying and selling gradually cleared, and the market situation turned tired. As a result, most stocks rose by more than 1 yuan from the previous day. Today, the public's attention was concentrated on grains and goods. Chicago wheat soared 5 points (the maximum limit) due to eager buyers and a shortage of sellers. The Grain Exchange Council has already decided to cancel the limit from the close of tomorrow, so people's hearts are even more excited. Oats rose 4 points, corn rose 3 points, and rye rose 2 points, all maximum limit changes. Also, the interest rate for 60-day and 90-day loans was 4%. Today's transaction volume was 3.3 million shares. The Dow Jones and several stock market prices are listed on the left (unit: gold yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is tired and in a weak state, really because the bottom goods are too thick and the sales channels are too narrow. This situation was reported in this newspaper earlier, so although American cotton has risen, the yarn market is difficult to stimulate. But some, because their base is already small, have strong pulling power, so the market situation is still brewing.</p>

<p>The man-marked cotton market opened weak. Although American cotton rose, many prepared to take advantage of the rise and dump it. The market price was depressed, and each month fell by 6.7.9 qian. The afternoon opening market situation was good, but at the close, it suddenly fell. It was heard that Shenxin Factory released a large quantity of 1,000 bales, and affected by this, each month fell again by 1.2.3.4 qian. The total daily transaction was 18,800 bales. Selling included Tongfu 650 bales, Yantai 550 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Senkang 450 bales, Shenji 550 bales, and Changfeng 850 bales. Buying included Shenchang 650 bales, Jifeng 850 bales, Suilong 1,250 bales, Tongxing 1,200 bales, Hengyi 900 bales, and Gengfeng 500 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The sale of existing yarn remains flat. It was found that the various gangs bought a total of 583 bales, with prices falling by 2.5 to 5 qian. Shenxin Factory released 3,000 bales of 20-count Manzhong Caicai, priced at 148 taels and 7.5 qian, cleared for 6.7.8.3 months.

<p>Luzhou 55 Inland 135</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Weihaiwei 100</p>
<p>The flower market suddenly fell. American cotton, which had been suspended for 11 days, resumed operations today and rose by 50-60 points. But silver prices were slightly feared, and the market tended to be short. The exchange rate was slack. It was calculated that the silver market price was not much higher. Also, yesterday, it was expected that American cotton would rise by more than 100 points, but the speculative buyers absorbed the amount and remained strong and unwilling to release it. Because the bottom goods are too thin, foreign cotton cannot be too cheap, so the mind looks at a high. As for what will happen, it depends on the Indian cotton market.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was from the 20th to the 30th, and both retail and wholesale were slightly relaxed, and the market situation became quiet and stable. Su Tongbang and Nangang Qingjiao rice, high-quality goods stabilized, Zhongguan was somewhat soft, and Duyangjian lacked goods and the stomach was sluggish, and the price was neither honorable nor disgraceful. Bianyinyuan's market price was drooping and soft because of the poor sales path. Changbang's situation was weak, and the medium-quality goods were also a little bit.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, 46 or 47 ships from various gangs arrived at Hexia. The white japonica rice shops were short of stomach selection and the price was slightly reduced, and the market shape was shortened by one or two cents. Early thin said that the source was endless, and the retail stomach was sluggish, and the price was a little bit. The goods from Yangdujian were available for retail sales at a flat price, and the price was close to a foot. The price of both the top-quality and white-tip rice was also close to a corner. Factory customers were short of top-quality goods and the price was fixed. Yinyuan was short of arrival, and Baiyuan was slightly tired.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour and Wheat Slightly Stable <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Flour market opened in the morning, and the prices for each month were slightly stable. The quoted price for foreign wheat, Chicago, has been quoted, which is 1 yuan and 67 cents higher than before the market was closed. Canada has also risen by 70 or 80 cents, but the atmosphere abroad is difficult to follow, and the gold price in the early market has fallen by more than 10 yuan, and the chips of the large factories are very large. The number of unaccepted is not to be underestimated. Furthermore, because the situation in Hebei is still tight, there are very few speculators, so after the market opened, it was only slightly better, and there was no special surge. Until the afternoon market opened, the prices for each month hovered in the middle, and the trend was slightly stable. Because the customer gangs had a slight intention to enter, the factory sales were not smooth, and the opening price became firmer. However, the price of Canadian wheat has become expensive, and Argentine wheat is still loose. The United States bid only 3 yuan, 2 cents, and 8 cents, which can be traded. The difficulty of the flour market may be due to this. As a result, this month rose 5% compared to the previous day, April rose 1%, May was 7.5% better, June rose 1%, and July and August rose 1.25%.</p>
<p>Wheat market, after the opening of the morning and afternoon markets, the prices for each month generally turned slightly stable. The quoted price for foreign wheat, Chicago, rose 1 yuan and 60 cents, and Canadian wheat rose 70 or 80 cents. In normal times, the market would have undergone tremendous changes. Recently, due to the continuous import of foreign wheat, buyers outside the industry did not dare to raise the price, so it was still flat. That is, the transaction of each board is also as usual. As a result, the morning of this month was 2% better, the afternoon was not open, there was no comparison for April, May, and June, and July and August were 1% better.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Foreign Rice Continues to Be Sold <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to be traded, and this street also had intentions to handle it. Then Anli Foreign Company sold 400 bags to Xiaojiao at a price of 7 yuan and 6 and a half cents, and a Saigon bag of 300 bags at a price of 8 yuan and 4 and a half cents. The whole batch continued to have 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao, and the price was the same as yesterday's opening, which was still 3 yuan and 4 cents per 100 catties. Yesterday, the customer's transformation of the rice was still active, but there was a lack of arrival, and the market turned to masonry. The red rice of the machine was walking briskly for five or six cents, and the turnover was still mainly based on Fujian sales, but it was not easy to select, so not many went there.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Market Fragments <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Jinshan Biantizhi Since the price increase, the good goods on the market have been opened at 35 taels and a half. Now that the customer's stomach is full and there is an intention to return, yesterday's market price was slightly lower than the highest price.</p>
<p>No. 24, coarse sand white sugar ordinary goods opened at 14 taels and 9 cents, which was 5 cents less than before. No. 20 medium sand white still needs 14 taels and 4 cents due to lack of goods. No. 89 Dutch red is 11 taels and 56 cents, all of which are less accepted.</p>
<p>The top-quality true Mianhu red has already arrived in dozens of packages. The identity and color are excellent. Yesterday's opening price was 10 taels and 4 cents, which was higher than the ordinary Zhan red.</p>
<p>Because of the small amount of nutmeg arriving recently and the sales stomach is still acceptable, the price of large-grain vegetable nutmeg has secretly increased by several cents. However, the thick storage of small-grain Ming nutmeg is still tired, and the market for wool nutmeg is still flat and stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk factories in Chang'an and Xiashi and other places entered 27 boxes of man-made silk in March and April, and the price trend was firm and rising.</p>
<p>The sales of Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang to France have started. Yesterday, more than 380 boxes of Zhenmei green tea and more than 130 boxes of Zhenmei pearl tea were sold. They were all bought by Yihua Yingfa Yongxing Doud and other firms and transported to Morocco for sale. The price has fallen by four or five taels compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Talking about Promotional Texts <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>In China, the promotional effect of words has always been considered very important. Reading a proclamation can cure headaches, spreading a proclamation can stabilize the Jiangnan region, and those who kill thieves on horseback and write official reports after dismounting are considered to be all-round talents in both civil and military affairs. Sweeping with a sharp pen can sweep away 5,000 people. In modern times, the use of this textual propaganda has become even more widespread. Shops that specialize in selling Japanese goods will post leaflets vowing not to buy or sell enemy goods, and even beggars who tear up advertising paper to make clothes are wearing large characters saying "Aviation Saves the Country." Furthermore, not long ago, Rehe had won many victories, and after the September 18th Incident, the volunteer army killed enemies, and it is unknown how many tens of thousands they killed.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the situation has changed, and even the words "shortening the line of defense" and "luring the enemy deep" in the newspapers feel outdated. So, they have become declarations. They say, "The direct negotiations reported outside are not true." Then they say, "If the Japanese invaders enter south of the Great Wall, our army will resist to the death, and the responsibility should be borne by Japan." Even the distant Guangdong Province in the southwest has issued orders to store grain and defend against insults, and the dock workers in Shanghai have issued a declaration welcoming Wang Jingwei to save the country.</p>
<p>These are all very good promotional texts, which can suppress people's hearts to a great extent, and can also bluff and bluster to a small extent. However, if the bluffing becomes too excessive, there is also a danger of becoming unable to justify oneself later. The Japanese have a saying, called (笛聲徹天，踊者不前), which Japanese newspapers often use to mock us. In fact, we are indeed a little qualified to be mocked. However, our ancestors also had some foresight. They had long seen that these textual propagandas created by them would definitely become empty signboards that would deceive both the old and the young. Therefore, they left us a final word, called (有文事者必有武備). "Those who engage in civil affairs must have military preparations!" I repeat this sentence here again, so that the Japanese soldiers will not underestimate us too much, and just kill their way into the city.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Liu Zongyuan Demands that Hu Huaichen Correct and Apologize <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>Today, I feel slightly unwell. I lay in bed in the morning and read "Free Talk," and I still fell asleep in a daze. My deceased friend suddenly came in a dream, saying that he had just met Liu Zongyuan (Why hasn't Liu Zongyuan been reincarnated yet? I can't explain this, I have to ask Mr. Hu Huaichen, who has been a vegetarian for ten years and wholeheartedly worships Buddha). Zongyuan was very angry, saying that Hu Huaichen (arbitrarily) tampered with his articles, (damaging his personal reputation, he must demand correction and apology). He attached a letter and entrusted him to forward it to me and introduce it to "Free Talk" for publication, so that he could follow the example (publish this letter, and automatically correct and apologize.) Dead people also want to settle accounts with the living, which is really troublesome! But since I have been entrusted, I have to copy the letter and send it out. Whether or not it is published depends on the editor's example. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To Mr. Li Liewen, Editor of Free Talk: Today I saw in the "Free Talk" published on March 16 (Letters to the Editor, one knows that Hu Huaichen thinks that his articles are very authoritative and does not allow others to comment. If there are any comments, he must automatically correct and apologize. If this example is implemented, then he should also do the same to others. Now I find in my humble work (Records of the Mountains and Rivers of Liuzhou Near the Administration that Can Be Visited,):" (石魚之山全石，無大草木，山小而高，其形如立魚，在多秭歸西) in one sentence he arbitrarily tampered with it without giving any reason. He crossed out my original word (在) with square brackets, and also put (西) at the beginning of the next sentence. (See (Student Chinese Classics Series) published by the Commercial Press (Liu Zongyuan's Works, page 194). He arbitrarily tampered with it, making my article inconsistent. Also, on page 76 of the same book, in the article (Records of the You Huangjin Stream), because I had already mentioned the Huangjin Temple in front, and then described the Huangjin Temple above, I omitted the word (祠) and wrote (黄神), saying: (黄神之上，揭水八十步，···.) He also arbitrarily ridiculed the two words (黄神), saying (the word 神 is suspected to be a mistake for the word 祠). Since he arbitrarily ridicules and tampers with it like this, I now believe that there is a need to follow the example (to demand correction and apology). The simple explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) My first sentence, in today's fashionable language, is to use the product to represent the place of origin. This writing style was commonly used by ancient people, and it was even more commonly used in the Overseas Classic in the (Classic of Mountains and Seas.) This sentence imitates the writing style of (Classic of Mountains and Seas), using the three words (多秭歸) to represent the Xianyi Mountain in Duozigui mentioned in the previous article. He repeatedly said that I was studying (Classic of Mountains and Seas), but he did not (carefully check (Classic of Mountains and Seas) to see if there was such a writing style, and arbitrarily tampered with it, and arbitrarily added a note, saying (this sentence Duozigui refers to the Mountain of Stone Fish being Duozigui.) And he deliberately compiled it into the (Student Chinese Classics Series,) widely publicizing it to the student community. I believe that it damages my personal reputation and must demand correction and apology.</p>
<p>(2) My second sentence is also a commonly used abbreviation. I can't remember many examples at the moment, but I remember reading a book about my world that has such a sentence:</p>
<p>The residence bestowed by Duke Qiu Wenda is at the Stone Tiger in Xuanwumen: Before Wenda: it was the Right Wing Zongxue: Before the Zongxue, it was the residence of Prince Wu: Before Prince Wu, it was the residence of Zhou Yanru, a senior scholar of the former Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>This book is (Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Reading the Subtle) by Ji Yun of the Qing Dynasty. The sentence quoted can be found in (As I Heard) 4. There are two omissions like mine in the sentence: one is the omission of the (First word) after (Before Wenda) of (Wenda), and the other is the omission of the (Residence) character after (Before Prince Wu) of (Prince Wu). He also arbitrarily ridiculed my abbreviation and promoted it in the student community. I believe that it also damages my personal reputation and must demand correction and apology.</p>
<p>(3) My request is made according to precedent, and I am not deliberately fooling around. Please publish this letter so that he will not think that there is no proof of death and he can say anything arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I wish you peace. From Liu Zongyuan, March 16</p>

<p>You Eastern foreign devils are too bullying. Do you want to take three provinces and then four? Okay, if you want to strip off my outer coat, I'll give you my underwear too. If you want to slap me on my left cheek, I'll give you my right cheek too. We are truly a long-established, dignified country of etiquette. Taking a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye is not acceptable. Are you going to make our father angry enough to take out a machine gun to fight back? A weasel will have a life-saving fart to push back if it is chased too hard. Have you seen the speech our father made?</p>
<p>This time I will definitely resist resolutely and without mercy.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait until I get on the plane before you start shelling.</p>
<p>It's okay to defend Rehe for ten days.</p>
<p>What's more, Tang Yulin was wanted for his lack of effort in defending.</p>
<p>You little ones are too proud and simply don't know what's good for you.</p>
<p>You occupied Rehe, Gubeikou, Xifengkou and took the Great Wall.</p>
<p>If you insist on advancing, our father has plenty of long-term resistance. Haven't you seen in the newspapers that our army is going to counterattack? And look, the non-resistance general has already telegraphed his resignation. Resist, resist, the third one is still resist, we are determined.</p>
<p>Do you know that our father has also mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops to suppress a few bandits?</p>
<p>How can we say that there are no large troops to deal with you, the robber who is invading us?</p>
<p>I advise you to clean up Rehe quickly and hold a celebration meeting.</p>
<p>Our father will catch his breath so that he can launch another round of counter-attacks.</p>

<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu masked his shame with a joking tone.</p>
<p>The public bus arrived. Haiquan and Mr. Zhu Wei boarded the bus together, sharing a seat.</p>
<p>"Are you going to school too?"</p>
<p>"No. I need to take a few days off."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"My grandfather passed away."</p>
<p>Haiquan casually made up this lie. In fact, his grandfather had been dead for seven or eight years.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am sorry..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said this English sentence, which aroused Haiquan's resentment. He thought, Mr. Zhu has never been to the United States or the Dutch, so why is he saying British words so playfully? At most, he is just a graduate of the English specialization department of a church school in Nanjing. "Then you're not going back?"</p>
<p>"I'm not going back."</p>
<p>Haiquan shook his head.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, if you don't go back, it's better to go to class. No one can avoid death! How old was your grandfather this year?"</p>
<p>"About seventy-one or seventy-two years old, I guess."</p>
<p>"That's about it..."</p>
<p>Haiquan found Mr. Zhu's nodding expression very ridiculous, and wanted to laugh, but quickly held back.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, have you heard any news at school?"</p>
<p>After a while, Zhu Wei suddenly asked Haiquan in a different way.</p>
<p>"(No.)"</p>
<p>Haiquan was also a little surprised and stared at Professor Zhu's face. He saw a yellow particle, between solid and liquid, hanging on the corner of Mr. Zhu's left eye. He then thought, Mr. Zhu hasn't even wiped his face clean, and he's saying "I am sorry"?</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, you have to help me."</p>

<p>— Zhang Menglin</p>
<p>What is the same rhyme? I asked an old gentleman from Qiu, who teaches Chinese at school.</p>
<p>"If a person uses a rhyme foot of 'yu', and you use it as your rhyme foot as well, that's called 'matching the rhyme.'" The old gentleman said.</p>
<p>"So, what if he not only takes someone else's foot, but even takes someone else's half body?" I had not yet finished speaking.</p>
<p>"Does he want to become that person?" The old gentleman asked.</p>
<p>"No, he wants to turn that person into himself."</p>
<p>"I mean, if he doesn't just use one rhyme foot, but uses two or three words, is it right to claim that this is a matching rhyme?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"Such a claim." The old gentleman brought up the past, and said with emotion. "In the past, when taking the imperial examination to become a Xiucai, one would be punished." "How would they be punished?"</p>
<p>"At that time, for a Xiucai who made such a claim, we would give him a fourth-class examination and punish him to carry a red manure bucket, meaning we would tell him to support the teacher."</p>
<p>"Ah, this gentleman is indeed studying agriculture, and I think he probably got a fourth-class grade at school."</p>
<p>"Oh, everything is going backwards now," the old gentleman sighed for a while.</p>
<p>But this solved a problem for me. Mr. Boyu, a student of the Agricultural University, said in a certain tabloid that two poems by a Mr. Zhang used three or four words from other people in each sentence, which was in accordance with the original rhyme. And he said, "But I admire his poems. His poems have a kind of fresh and passionate emotion..." If you haven't smelled the manure bucket, you won't be able to tell the difference between fragrance and foulness.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Coffin Shop <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Suzhou Short Stay Diary Two</p>
<p>Suzhou is full of...? (Suzhou is full of beauties!)</p>
<p>I don't think so. (Shanghai has more beauties than Suzhou.) Suzhou has the most coffin shops. They are everywhere on the streets and alleys. Outside the city of Suzhou, there are new stone monuments of the Suzhou Cemetery Protection Association everywhere. Since cemeteries can be protected, then coffin shops should be opened more, which should be logical. The president of the Cemetery Protection Association is said to be a highly respected (Mr. Peng, a local worthy); it would be even more appropriate if he also served as the boss of a coffin shop (the right person in the right place). Having a cup of tea, chatting casually, and passing the rest of your life in this way, the people of Suzhou seem not to be attached to the world. They only care about coffins, and if fir wood is not enough, they use nanmu; if nanmu is not enough, they use agarwood. For tombs, if soil mounds are not enough, they use stone enclosures; if stone enclosures are not enough, they use cemetery protection associations. It's all about the flavor of drinking tea and chatting leisurely. It makes me a little confused. Someone said: Most of the people who live in Suzhou as rentiers are old men with declining years. They don't have many days left to live, so they treat Suzhou as a large cemetery and make arrangements for the next life everywhere. This is closer to the truth. However, the wilderness is still the wilderness, undulating in height, and only a foot high; the coffins turn into dung, and the corpses turn into worms. It still takes the strength of Mr. Peng to prevent them from becoming a flat ground. If you understand it with the philosophy of drinking tea and chatting leisurely, then there is no need to open coffin shops, no need to set up cemetery protection associations, and Mr. Peng would also feel that everything is superfluous. It's a pity that these words can't be said to the people of Suzhou.</p>
<p>The streets and alleys of Suzhou are full of black walls; black symbolizes death, and this color is quite harmonious with coffin shops. As soon as I see black walls, I think I'm walking into a tomb. At that time, I was reading various records of the Russian Soviet Union's five-year plan; the Russian Soviet Union regarded wood as very precious, and using it for firewood would be considered a waste of good material. But I myself was living in a circle of bosses who planned to bury the single-width fir wood underground to let it rot. It's really (living next to ghosts)! Listen, Suzhou dialect is coming:</p>
<p>(Where do you live?)</p>
<p>(I live next to a coffin shop.)</p>
<p>(That's really bad luck!)</p>

<p>Beiping The fierce battle between Song Zheyuan's troops and the enemy at Xifengkou lasted for eight days and nights. The enemy's Hattori Brigade was almost completely wiped out. Song troops' combat method is to lie in ambush during the day and come out at night. We use broadswords as a powerful weapon to kill the enemy, so that the enemy, even with new weapons such as airplanes, artillery, and tanks, cannot exert their power. Wang Ziyu's battalion of this army fought fiercely for five days and nights, with five officers and thirty-seven soldiers killed in action, and eleven officers and three hundred and forty-one soldiers wounded. The battalion commander was also seriously injured. In addition, the officers killed in action included Regiment Adjutant Hu Chonglu, Battalion Commander Su Cheyuan, Wang Fengzhi, etc. (18th Central Telegram)</p>

After fighting until 2 pm, the officers and soldiers bravely charged forward and broke through the first line of the enemy, and then broke through the second line, capturing three enemy officers who will be sent to Beiping to ask for instructions on what to do. More than a thousand enemy soldiers died, and our officers and soldiers were also killed and wounded in about one battalion. Song's army hopes that all sectors will provide material assistance to support the long war.

My visit to Ping to negotiate with the various envoys was for this purpose. The result is that the envoys fully understand our country's self-defensive resistance, which can be considered satisfactory. As for the Sino-Japanese incident, since it has been dealt with impartially by the League of Nations, our country will never accept direct negotiations under any circumstances. Before the lost territories are recovered, direct negotiations would be akin to a surrender under duress. I dare say that our country's diplomacy will never be subdued by Japan's violence. We will continue to resist to the end, seeking survival through struggle."</p>

<p>Arrest Three Korean Revolutionaries</p>
<p>Seized three pistols and two bombs on the spot. The three Koreans were plotting to assassinate Japanese envoy Arichika Akira</p>
<p>Several people were also arrested in conjunction with the French police and Chinese police</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports: At 9:25 last night, secret detectives from the Japanese Consulate in this port, in conjunction with the Hongkou police, arrested three Koreans at the Song Jiang Chun Restaurant, No. 271 Wuchang Road. Three pistols and two bombs were seized. The method of manufacture was the same as that used in the Hongkou Park bombing last year that killed General Shirakawa, among others. It is reported that the three Koreans will be charged with plotting to assassinate Japanese envoy Arichika Akira. The three are Li Kangxun, 22 years old; Bai Jiubo, 28 years old; and Xuan Xun. It is believed that they recently threw a bomb at the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin. They were caught off guard and could not resist arrest, so they surrendered. It is reported that these three, along with a person in Western attire, went to the restaurant together last night, but the person in Western attire left after talking briefly at the bottom of the stairs and did not go upstairs. Last night, detectives searched for this person, but his whereabouts were still unknown when the "China Press" went to print. Previously, the Japanese Consulate received a confidential report stating that some Koreans were planning to assassinate Japanese envoy Arichika Akira last night. The Japanese envoy was attending a banquet at a certain Japanese hall on Peng Road that night. Secret detectives were stationed all around, patrolling the area. They saw a suspicious person enter the Song Jiang Chun Restaurant and secretly went to surround and arrest him. At a signal, they rushed upstairs in a crowd. All the people were wearing steel mesh vests, so they were even bolder. When they went upstairs, they saw the three Koreans sitting at a table, just about to start eating. Before they could move, they were seized by the crowd. They were disarmed, and a package resembling a lunchbox was placed aside. Inside were two bombs, one square, weighing about five pounds, and one smaller and round, both made in the same way. According to the Japanese authorities' examination last night, they felt that they were made by Europeans. In order to eliminate Korean reactionary parties, Japanese police and Hongkou police detectives, in conjunction with French Concession police and Nanshi police, searched various suspected locations. Two of the arrested people resided at No. 16 Laishi Road, near Xujiahui Road. The detectives went to the address to search, and as a result, they obtained information and went to other locations to search. For a while, patrol cars were dispatched in all directions. The result was unknown late at night. It is reported that several people were arrested. The three Koreans arrested at the Song Jiang Chun Restaurant were first taken to the Hongkou Police Station. After completing the procedures, they were transferred to the Japanese authorities. It is reported that many Korean revolutionaries have secretly arrived in Shanghai in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A representative of the "China Press" rushed to the Song Jiang Chun Restaurant to inquire a few minutes after the incident. According to the restaurant staff, just after 9 o'clock, two Chinese people, one dressed in Western attire, leisurely went upstairs. A few minutes later, two more Western-dressed guests arrived in rickshaws and stood near the stairs, talking in a low voice, unable to hear what they were saying, and unable to distinguish their dialect. Before long, one of those standing went away. The remaining one went upstairs and joined the two who had arrived earlier and were sitting by the window. The three ordered a bottle of beer and a plate of fried fish. They spoke in Northern dialect, and one of them spoke Chinese very fluently, but their appearance was still Korean. At first, I didn't pay attention to what the three were carrying. After I poured wine into three cups, they finished it in a few minutes. I went downstairs to urge the kitchen to quickly serve the fried fish, and I saw several unusual people looking around in front of the restaurant. A waiter wanted to go out for something, but was blocked by a Westerner in uniform. Looking at the back door, there were also several people in steel mesh vests guarding there. They were not Westerners. I can be sure that they were all Japanese. When the fried fish was served, the three were just about to pick up their chopsticks when people in steel mesh vests rushed upstairs with shields and pistols. There were at least eight Japanese who went upstairs, but I didn't have time to count them. In addition, there was one Western police chief and one Chinese detective. As soon as these people went upstairs, they pointed their guns at the three. I was very surprised, but the three did not change their expressions, did not jump up, and did not even lift their hands. The police searched the three, and I was pushed to the back of the crowd. Later, I heard that they had found two pistols, but I didn't see them. I only saw a small package wrapped in newspaper on the table. At that time, there was still one Chinese diner at another table, and after being checked, he was also pushed to the back of the crowd. What surprised me most was that the three customers were calm throughout and always had smiles on their faces. One of them, dressed in a Chinese long robe, even laughed loudly when the Japanese police patted his cheek. The three were then taken away by the crowd. I didn't see if they got into a car. The three were between 25 and 35 years old. The one who left earlier never returned.</p>

<p>Meetings with Mussolini Today and Tomorrow. The Japanese Military's Attitude Toward British Disarmament.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 17th - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon departed from here for Italy at 8:45 this evening. According to sources in Rome, Italian figures believe that in these turbulent international times, it is very gratifying that British authorities have come to Rome to discuss plans for the construction of Europe with the Italian government. They believe that this meeting has a major relationship with Europe and Italy.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 17th - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon traveled by train from Geneva to Genoa, Italy, and then switched to an airplane personally piloted by Italian Air Minister General Balbo to fly to Rome. When the plane arrived in the capital, Prime Minister Mussolini personally went to the airport to welcome MacDonald and Simon. The two went directly from the airport to the British Embassy for lunch. After lunch, they held talks. In the evening, Mussolini hosted a banquet. On Sunday, MacDonald toured Rome and continued talks in the afternoon. There was also an evening banquet at the British Embassy.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - Regarding the new disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald on the 6th, the Army authorities will study the contents after the report arrives. The opinions they currently hold on the various proposals are roughly as follows: The new proposal stipulates that the longest service period for combat personnel is eight months. This is a proposal for European countries and has nothing to do with Japan. If the proposal applies to countries outside of Europe, Japan's service period is one and a half years, so it is very difficult to train soldiers in such a short period of time, and the required expenses are also considerable. Japan cannot agree. The plan also stipulates that Germany's troop numbers are 200,000, which France will definitely not recognize, which is clear. Japan cannot agree to limiting the caliber of mobile land artillery to 150 millimeters, but the maximum limit of 16 inches for coastal defense artillery is acceptable. The maximum weight of tanks being 16 tons is a plan that is beneficial to Britain. France advocates for 60 tons, and Japan advocates for 25 tons. Also, the military aircraft of France, Japan, Italy, Russia, the United States, and Britain are limited to 500 aircraft, which Japan absolutely cannot agree to. It is difficult to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft. Britain and the United States have 20 times more civilian aircraft than Japan, so equal regulations should not be applied.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Lister &amp; Co., textile merchants from Bradford, England, issued a notice today stating that the shirts worn by Japanese army and navy soldiers are now made of silk. Japan is the world's largest producer of raw silk, and the United States is the largest consumer of raw silk. However, at present, American trade is very sluggish. Japan is unwilling to sell all of its silk on the market, which would result in a sharp drop in market prices. Therefore, it weaves its own silk goods, and then uses silk to make shirts for army and navy soldiers.</p>

<p>Guangzhou: Although industry and commerce in this region have been affected by the global economic decline, and the situation in North China has caused unease, Guangzhou's municipal development has not been slowed. According to statistics from the Bureau of Public Works, a total of 380 building permits were issued in February, of which 120 were for building houses on vacant land. Today, Mayor Liu Jiwen claimed that Guangzhou's three-year plan is currently underway. Projects such as the Haizhu Bridge have been completed on schedule. Two steel bridges are also planned to be added to the Pearl River soon. The average citizen of Guangzhou benefits more from the municipal government than they pay in taxes. It is found that in January of this year, the municipal government's income and expenditure were short by more than ten thousand yuan. The total revenue for the entire year last year was 9 million yuan, of which 5 million yuan came from taxes. Based on the number of citizens, the tax paid per person is about 4 yuan and 14 cents, and the funds used for public works exceed the total amount of taxes collected. The average cost per person is more than 4 yuan and 90 cents. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Litvinov Insists Foreigners Must Be Subject to Soviet Law. British Ambassador Protests, Saying Anglo-Soviet Relations Are at the Point of Rupture</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 17th - Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov notified the British Ambassador in Moscow today that the employees of the arrested Vickers Electrical Company will be tried in the Supreme Court on charges of counter-revolution. The punishment for this crime is the death penalty. Litvinov refuted the notion that British citizens residing in the Soviet Union are not subject to Soviet law. Litvinov expressed hope that this case would not affect Anglo-Soviet relations, as relations are more important than any store or individual. The British Ambassador to Russia has protested, saying that the charge of sabotage is not credible and demanding that the case be dropped, otherwise it will affect the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement that expires on July 17, and Anglo-Soviet relations may be at the point of rupture.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 17th - Litvinov said this afternoon that no sense of oppression or threat can make Soviet law lax or release the arrested British citizens. If the British government and the British Ambassador both believe that the arrested are innocent, then their panic about the fate of the arrested is incomprehensible. The case will be publicly tried in the Supreme Court within one month.</p>

<p>Feng consistently advocates national mobilization for resisting Japan and saving the country. Li represents the Central Government to discuss the entire anti-Japanese plan with Feng</p>
<p>After hearing the news of the fall of Chengde, Central Committee member Li Liejun hurriedly traveled north, leaving Nanjing on March 4th and arriving in Taiyuan on the 6th. He conferred with Yan Xishan, the Director of Pacification in Taiyuan, about a plan to resist Japan and save the country, which was very satisfactory. Yan asserted that he was willing to dispatch all the troops from Shanxi and Suiyuan to recover the lost territory at the cost of their lives. Li stayed in Taiyuan for three days and traveled by car to Datong on the 9th. On the 10th, he arrived in Zhangjiakou, where Feng Yuxiang personally welcomed him at the station, taking his hand and accompanying him to Feng's residence. Li expressed that although the national crisis was extremely urgent, the people's hearts had not died, and there was still an opportunity for a turnaround in the future. Li and his secretary Zhang Migong, as well as more than ten attendants, felt extremely tired due to the hurried journey. They planned to stay in Zhangjiakou for two or three days to discuss the plan for resisting Japan and saving the country with Feng in detail. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went north, he sent a telegram to Li and Feng, discussing the situation. Currently, Chiang, Yan, and Feng all share the same view of recovering the lost territory by force. Yan and Feng will both assume important military positions for resisting Japan, in order to jointly overcome the national crisis and recover the lost territory as soon as possible. After Li arrived in Chahar, Feng invited Li and his attendants to a meal at his residence on the 11th. During the meal, Feng and Li briefly discussed the speed of the fall of Rehe and couldn't help but sigh. On the 11th, the reporter went to Feng Yuxiang's residence in Turugou, southeast of Zhangjiakou, to interview Li and Feng about the major plan for saving the country. They were received and discussed briefly as follows:</p>

<p>I, representing the Central Government, came north to meet with Mr. Yan and Mr. Feng to jointly discuss major plans for resisting Japan and saving the nation. I stayed in Taiyuan for three days. Mr. Yan's advocacy for resisting Japan is based on doing everything within his power and not hesitating to make any sacrifices. The Shanxi-Suiyuan generals all have the determination to fight to the death, and the people of Shanxi all know to go to the national crisis together. After the fall of Chengde, the people's morale was exceptionally sorrowful and indignant. The morale of the northerners is more concerned about the country than those in places of dissipation and entertainment like Beijing and Shanghai. Recently, the Central Government has made preparations for the plan to resist Japan and will no longer rely on the League of Nations. Chairman Chiang's coming north can show that the Central Government is determined to resist Japan. Mr. Yan and Mr. Feng have been commanding troops for many years and both advocate being determined to resist Japan. The Central Government intends to grant them important military positions. As for the opinions on resisting Japan offered by Mr. Yan and Mr. Feng, the Central Government has expressed sympathy. This time, I came north to represent the Central Government in inviting Mr. Yan and Mr. Feng to jointly meet the national crisis. After staying in Chahar for two or three days, I will go to meet Chairman Chiang, he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Li came to visit me on behalf of the Central Government to discuss the plan for resisting Japan. If the Central Government can truly be determined to resist Japan and implement my proposal for national mobilization, then why should I care about whether I hold an important position or not? Even as a common soldier, carrying a gun to the battlefield would be joyful. As for whether I go to Nanjing or not, that is not a problem. Mr. Chiang's coming north is enough to show his determination to resist Japan, which is some comfort to the common people. Mr. Yan's views are the same as mine. Whether we meet or not is also not a problem. In other words, everyone should take up arms and go to the battlefield at this critical moment, determined to fight to the death. National mobilization to recover lost territory is not a difficult task, and so on. Since the fall of Chengde, Feng has become increasingly sorrowful and indignant. It is heard that recently, Feng and Chiang will meet somewhere. (March 11) (Mu Wen)</p>

<p>Plan to Reorganize the People's Militia</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Establishes the Militia Affairs Office to Oversee Militia Affairs Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Due to inconvenient transportation between the province and its districts and the complexity of the situations in various places, the organization of the people's militia is unsystematic, leading to local bullies and ruffians using the name of the militia to carry out exploitation and extortion, even looting, arson, and murder, turning it into a class that oppresses the people. The provincial government, being recently aware of this, has decided to reorganize the people's militia and has specially established a Militia Affairs Office to oversee militia affairs throughout the province. Chiang Guangnai will concurrently serve as the director of the office. Under him, there will be one secretary, and it will be divided into two sections. The first section will have three groups: design, personnel, and propaganda. The second section will have two groups: management and general affairs. Several inspectors will also be appointed to supervise and inspect the progress of militia affairs in various counties. The first step of the office's plan is to change the current system of recruiting soldiers, so that militiamen are all filled by good citizens, who can be a strong army when gathered and still be farmers and workers when scattered. The "Provisional Regulations for the Fujian Provincial Defense Regiment" have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The method is to divide the province into ten defense regiment districts, each with a chief and deputy commander, governing several counties (roughly from four or five to six or seven counties). Each county will also have a chief and deputy commander, and several standing squads will be established based on local conditions (roughly from two to four squads). Each squad will be divided into three platoons, and each platoon will be divided into three sections, with ten people in each section. All men aged 20 to 40 who have resided in the county for more than one year should be incorporated into the county's defense regiment and be obligated to undergo training and service. The term of service for the standing squad is nine months, after which they will be transferred to the reserve squad. The term of service for the reserve squad is two years and three months, after which they will be transferred to the rear guard squad. The term of service for the rear guard squad will be up to the age of military service. According to the office's plan, after this system is implemented for five years, the total number of people in the standing, reserve, and rear guard squads in the province can reach more than 1.71 million, all of whom have undergone military training and can be summoned at any time. In order to cultivate cadre talents, a militia cadre training institute will be specially established. The director of the institute will be concurrently held by the director of the Militia Affairs Office, and a director will be appointed under him, concurrently held by the secretary of the Militia Affairs Office, to preside over all affairs of the institute. It will be divided into primary and advanced classes. Primary students will be recommended by various counties from graduates of secondary schools or above, who are qualified with pure thoughts and healthy bodies, with five to twelve people from each county, totaling about 500 people. The advanced class will recruit retired military officers and those with military knowledge, totaling more than 100 people, and will be taught various knowledge of military affairs, politics, militia affairs, and society. Both classes are scheduled to graduate in four months. After graduation, they will be assigned to work in militia organizations at all levels. The primary class has been open for more than a month, and the advanced class will also begin on March 1. The office is also afraid that the people will not fully understand the reorganization at the beginning of its implementation and that obstacles will occur in the progress, so it has expanded propaganda and defined two items: propaganda steps and propaganda areas. The first phase of propaganda will publicize the theory of running the militia, the second phase will publicize the practical methods of running the militia, and the third phase will publicize the theory and practice of businesses related to the defense regiment (such as improving rural production, afforestation movement, cooperative businesses, etc.). The areas, in addition to those that are extremely common and superficial and do not contain local characteristics, will strive to be practical and consistent with the actual local situation, in order to arouse the interest of the people and create the concept of their support and assistance. Various pamphlets, leaflets, and pictorials have been compiled and printed and distributed to various counties for distribution. In order to make the people understand the practical measures of the militia in the future and to set an example for practical results, Minhou County, the provincial capital, has been designated as the Fujian Provincial Defense Regiment Experimental County and will be the first to implement the new system. A special commissioner has been dispatched by the office to cooperate with the Minhou County government to prepare for it. (March 10)</p>
<h3 id="e239">Japanese Privy Council Thinks Diplomacy Failed <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Uchida Should Bear Full Responsibility</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that the cabinet decision on the League of Nations withdrawal case was made on the 11th, but it must be reviewed by the Privy Council. Currently, the review committee consists of nine members, including Chairman Kuratomi, with Heiji Kiichiro as the chairman. However, the Privy Council believes that: (1) Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, because it could not carry out its主張, resulted in a score of forty-two to one, which cannot be said to be a major diplomatic failure; (2) Those who suffered this major failure must be blamed on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida should bear full responsibility for the failure; (3) After withdrawing from the League of Nations, it is also doubtful whether the Japanese government has a solid diplomatic fundamental policy. Strict responsibility will be pursued regarding the above three points.</p>

Then, at around 8:00 AM, he went to the Song residence where the Star Film Company filmed a sound film to address the soldiers at the front. He then visited Sun Ke to reminisce. He is expected to enter Nanjing tomorrow night or the morning after and plans to visit Chiang in the north. The various news items are recorded separately below.</p>

<p>Wang resided at the Chu residence last night. This morning at 8:00 AM, he met with Song Ziwen, the acting President of the Executive Yuan, and talked for a long time. After Song left, Wang immediately went to the Song residence where the Star Film Company filmed a sound film for Wang, which was a speech to the soldiers at the front. At around 10:00 AM, Wu Heling, the Mongolian representative in Nanjing, Qi Changshan, the Qinghai representative, and Gan Naikang and Shi Cipan, representatives from Inner Mongolia, visited, but they did not meet due to conflicting schedules.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Wang originally planned to film a five-minute sound film at the Star Film Company at 9:00 PM last night, giving a speech to the soldiers at the front. However, due to the fatigue of the journey, it was changed to 8:50 AM this morning at the Song residence. The sound film was about six minutes long, totaling over 500 feet, which is the longest of the sound films made by the company for the Chairman of the National Government and the heads of various Yuan.</p>

<p>Wang then went to visit Sun Ke on Columbia Road at 10:05 AM, accompanied by Chu Minyi. Chu left after accompanying Wang to the Sun residence. Wang and Sun had a pleasant conversation for about an hour and a half. He left at around 11:00 AM. Sun sent him to the door.</p>

<p>When Wang Jingwei left the Sun residence, he told reporters that he was not fully recovered from his illness and was afraid that his energy would not be sufficient to resume his position as President of the Executive Yuan, which would be a mistake. Therefore, he strongly advised the Acting President Song to continue to be responsible and not suddenly unload the burden. He will definitely go to Nanjing next Monday. It has not yet been determined whether he will take the night train tomorrow night or fly the morning after. As for whether he will go to Baoding to meet with Chairman Chiang, it will be decided after he goes to Nanjing. It is heard that Chairman Chiang has said that he will go south within a day or two, or they may meet in Nanjing. If Mr. Chiang cannot go south, then he will go north.</p>

<p>After Wang left, Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters and said that he had already personally told everyone what Mr. Wang had said during his visit, which did not cover party affairs, politics, or diplomacy. When Mr. Wang passed through Hong Kong, he met with Mr. Hu Zhantang. Mr. Hu's views are very deep and he has not changed his old ways. The war in the north is very fierce, and the responsible personnel of the government are all determined to resist the enemy, only seeing the strength. He came to Shanghai to meet Wang because Wang returned to the country.</p>

<p>Wang gave a six-minute speech to the soldiers at the front in a sound film made by the Star Film Company at Qi Qi Song's residence this morning at 8:00 AM. The general idea was that since September 18th, the Japanese have been invading day by day. Shanghai, Shanhaiguan, and Jehol have been forced to retreat one after another. Like the flesh on a person's body, it is being cut off by others day by day. How painful it is. The international community is dissatisfied with the Japanese atrocities. However, Japan is spreading rumors, saying that our country is not organized, and that our army is engaged in internal warfare and cannot resist foreign aggression, and that we are not qualified as a country. Now our army has risen up to resist. He hopes that the soldiers will work hard to kill the enemy and silence the mouths of the Japanese. Secondly, he repeatedly stated that to resist foreign aggression, we must have internal unity, and that internal unity will make the strength to resist foreign aggression even greater. His words are extremely alert.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Ridiculous and Absurd <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Schemes of the Tyrannical Japan</p>
<p>The Sino-Federal Empire Secret Agreement Will Further Disrupt Our Country, Support Rebels to Enter the Pass and Restore the Dynasty</p>
<p>The tyrannical Japan has occupied Northeast China and Jehol, and its ambitions have not yet ended. It is constantly spying on and disrupting Tianjin and Peking. Recently, there have been rumors that Japan and the puppet regime have signed a secret agreement (the Sino-Federal Empire Secret Agreement). After many inquiries, its ridiculous and absurd plan has been obtained, which is urgently disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) There are only two types of countries in the world today: one is capitalist, such as Britain, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France, and the other is communist, such as Soviet Russia. Now, to resist Soviet Russia, China and Japan must unite, and then persuade Britain, the United States, Italy, and France to understand its practices, which cannot be successful. (2) To unite China and Japan, Japan must not assist Manchuria, restore the imperial system, and eliminate the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang, which once united with the Communists. A major problem cannot be successful. (3) According to historical research, there are three ways to pacify the world: one is a popular movement, one is military conquest, and one is historical evolution and popular elections. China has already gone bankrupt and cannot be applied. Military conquest has passed through Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang, Duan Qirui, and Chiang Kai-shek, all of whom have failed and cannot be successful. Now, after more than 300 years, the Emperor Xuantong can win over a group of people and can apply the dictatorship system to sort out all the plans of the new country. China wants to unite with Japan, and Japan must help the Emperor of the Sino-Federal Empire restore power to be successful. To help the Emperor restore power, the first step is to recover North China as the basic country. Second, we must imitate the method of the Qin State helping Chong'er of the Jin State restore the country, the method of Britain and France helping Poland, Turkey, and other small European countries gain independence, and the method of France helping the United States break away from Britain. Formal army, navy, and air force forces must be used to eliminate the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, which once tolerated the Communists. Third, the Chinese people are poor and have exhausted their wealth, which has reached its extreme. Japan must first provide economic assistance to sort out the army, banks, and other relief measures, and then turn to other countries to raise public debt, build railways, develop mines, reclaim wasteland, and revitalize various industries. If these three points of assistance are possible, the Sino-Japanese Alliance can be successful. If Japan is willing to help the Sino-Federal Empire restore power, it must obtain the area north of the Yellow River as the foundation. To obtain the provinces north of the Yellow River, first, Japan must borrow 60 warships to occupy Tanggu and Tianjin, 20 warships to occupy Qingdao, and 20 warships to garrison up and down the Yangtze River. The north and south of the Yellow River can be determined by issuing a proclamation. Second, borrow 100 airplanes to disrupt the military morale in the rear of Tianjin and Jehol. Third, the warships and airplanes should all fly the flag of the Sino-Federal Empire. (4) The Japanese and Manchu governments should secretly prepare a military expenditure of 10 million yuan for Shandong within a possible scope, 5 million yuan for Shanxi, 5 million yuan for Hebei, 20 million yuan for the provinces along the Yangtze River, 20 million yuan for Guangdong and Guangxi, and 20 million yuan for the temporary scale of construction of the new country, which will be allocated from the counter-property of Manchuria. (5) Japan and Manchuria should first send secret envoys to detail the permanent basic treaty of the Sino-Federal Empire, and neither party shall disclose it. (6) Before the military occupation of Tianjin and Peking, the Manchu executive should announce the constitution and prepare the plan for the restoration of power and the facilities of the imperial family with the consent of Japan. (7) After the Sino-Japanese secret treaty is signed, the Manchu executive should telegraph the whole country and secretly send representatives to prepare for the restoration ceremony. (8) After the Sino-Federal Empire occupies Tianjin and Peking, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Peking and the ambassadors of various countries who once signed the treaty protecting the Qing Empire will discuss and send ambassadors to each other, and discuss the plan of the Sino-Federal Empire to eliminate communism and resist Soviet aggression. (9) After the Sino-Federal Empire occupies Tianjin and Peking, it will convene a federal conference to deliberate on the Sino-Federal Constitution and exchange strategies for the construction of China. (10) Because of the friendship of Japan's help to the Sino-Federal Empire, the Sino-Federal Empire will sincerely organize the Sino-Japanese Economic League, the Industrial League, and various committees to plan the grand plan of various economic industries of the Sino-Federal Empire. Military affairs will be determined separately. (11) Manchuria and Guangdong or other provinces with special circumstances may be allowed by the constitution to use special organizations for independent help. The provinces in the central and northern Yellow River are divided into two systems: one is an autonomous state, and the other is a mandated state. (12) The heads of various religions of the Sino-Federal Empire should be concurrently led by the emperor, but the people are allowed to believe freely. (13) In order to revitalize the industry and roads, the Sino-Federal Empire is allowed to invest in various countries to reside in the interior and abolish concessions.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Revolution Anniversary in Beiping <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Held at City Headquarters This Morning</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Beiping People's Revolution. The Beiping City Party Headquarters specially convened more than 100 representatives from various schools, organizations, labor unions, and party headquarters at all levels at 9:00 AM this morning, with Chairman Xing presiding. The opening ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening ceremony (2) Singing the Party Song (3) Bowing to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the Prime Minister (4) The Chairman respectfully reading the Prime Minister's will (5) Silent mourning for the martyrs of the March 18th Massacre for three minutes (6) Chairman's report (7) Speech (8) Shouting slogans (9) Ceremony completed. Chairman Xing Wan's speech briefly stated that on March 18th, 1926, the people of Beiping, resentful of the pretext of the international imperialists for the Dagu Incident, issued an ultimatum to us and held a demonstration at Tiananmen, determined to oppose it. At the same time, they petitioned the Tianjin government, but unexpectedly, the authorities opened fire on them, killing more than 50 people on the spot and seriously injuring more than 80 people. This is the truth of the tragic incident. We want to commemorate the March 18th Massacre and at the same time, we should deeply understand the significance of the March 18th Massacre: 1. Resist imperialism, 2. Overthrow the traitorous warlords. Now China has suffered the arbitrary invasion of Japanese imperialism and our great rivers and mountains have been occupied by them. Today, the Northeast must commemorate the March 18th Massacre and at the same time, we should follow the spirit of struggle of the people of Beiping in the March 18th Massacre, either contributing wealth or providing assistance to the soldiers resisting Japan, so that the soldiers resisting Japan do not have to worry about the lack of material resources, and so on.</p>

According to private sources, after the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement expires, the government authorities have decided to revise it completely. If the Japanese side refuses, the old agreement will be declared invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Wu Suzhou Accused of Being Arrested Again <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Reported by a Surrendered Communist, Mr. A, Extradition Requested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Wu Suzhou, also known as Wu Yu, from Xuzhou, who used to be a reporter for a certain newspaper, was arrested by the detectives of the Songhu Garrison Command in the autumn of 1930 in cooperation with the police of the Public Concession, and was sent to the First Special District Local Court for adjudication. He was then transferred to the Garrison Command for interrogation. After investigation by the military judge of the department, he was found to be true and sentenced to two years in prison and imprisoned in the Caoh Jing Prison. It was not until the autumn that Wu was released from prison due to the promulgation of the Amnesty Ordinance by the National Government. Later, he resided at No. 3113, Dongyouheng Road, and continued to work as a reporter for the Shanghai News Agency, Datong News Agency, Shanghai Business Daily, and Gongbao. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, Wu was passing near the entrance of the Wonderland Amusement Park at the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road when he was spotted by Lu Keqin, a supervisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accompanied by a surrendered Communist, Mr. A. Mr. A reported to Supervisor Lu, pointing out that Wu was still working for the Communist Party, serving as an important position in the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and using the name of a newspaper reporter to secretly inquire about the news of the handling of the Communist Party by various agencies, so as to inform his comrades so that they could escape in advance. So Lu called in Chinese police officer No. 1083 and arrested Wu at the Lao Zha Police Station. This morning, he was sent to the Second Branch of the High Court, where Judge Yu held a collegial panel to hear the case. Supervisor Lu sent two surrendered Communists to the case to prove Wu Suzhou, also known as Wu Yue, and Zhao Yun, and the work he was doing. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent lawyer Zhan Jifeng, a legal advisor, to the court to apply for extradition. The lawyer of the police station, Gan Jingxian, declared that he did not object. Judge Yu then ruled that the officers of the Public Security Bureau should take him away and return him to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Solved: Eight Drown in <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yushun Ship Collision Case</p>
<p>Compensation of Six Thousand Yuan. The Yushun Wheel of the China Merchants Bureau recently collided with and sank a Jinshunxing fishing boat in the Putuo Sea, killing eight boatmen, including Liu Anbang and Liu Ashi, on the spot. After the accident, the Yushun Wheel rescued 15 people, including Liu Xili. Later, the shipowner Ke Mingshan reported to Yuhuan County that 27 people were on board the ship. In addition to the four people, including Jiang Chunshui, who were rescued by the Liangrixing fishing boat, and the 15 people who were brought to Shanghai by Yushun, eight people drowned in the Bintuo Sea. This matter was of great importance. The Ministry also instructed the bureau to thoroughly investigate the truth and handle it properly. Liu Hongsheng appointed a special commissioner, Zhang Yiming, to conduct an on-site investigation at the scene of the accident to determine the number of casualties. According to the shipowner of Yushun, all the people who fell into the water were rescued and no one died. Zhang Yiming thoroughly investigated the results and confirmed that the number of people who drowned at that time was not as many as eight. According to the loss report submitted by Ke Mingshan, the amount of loss reached more than 10,000 yuan. After many negotiations and several face-to-face talks with the shipowner, the bureau specially expressed sympathy for the fishing boat and paid 6,000 yuan to settle the case. This compensation will be notified by the bureau to the company that underwrote the Yushun Wheel's water insurance, and the company will pay half of the amount. The long-standing collision tragedy has come to an end.</p>

<p>Before Commissioner Zhang was ordered to enter Sichuan, because the Central Government did not have a concrete plan for the reorganization method, the trip was delayed.

According to Mr. Zhang himself, he will go north to Baoding to see Chairman Chiang as soon as he feels better.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Another Iron Proof That China Will Not Perish <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>A few days ago there was (the pseudo-emperor's relatives) being patriotic, and recently there is the (Guangzhou) famous socialite Ms. Chen, using her charms to save the country.</p>
<p>This is not a problem. When the country is in dire straits, and its demise is imminent, as long as one is a citizen of China, everyone has the responsibility to save the country. (The pseudo-emperor's relatives) are no exception, so (socialites) saving the country is also within reason. Moreover, (a weak woman cannot serve on the battlefield), so of course, she must (use her beauty to serve the country). From this, we can see that there is more than one way to save the country, and (beauty) (charm) can also have a great effect.</p>
<p>However, here we have a very valuable discovery. How many young and handsome young masters, although they may not necessarily regard the country as something external to themselves while chasing after pleasure in singing and dancing halls, cannot but desperately rush to the great love arena. Even spending a thousand gold coins for a smile is worthwhile, let alone just a ten-yuan donation to have (some hope) of keeping a beauty in a golden house. Moreover, they gain the favor of the beauty and also achieve the effect of saving the country. Therefore, they are all worthy people. If China does not perish, of course, they will all have made a great contribution. At the same time, we can more clearly understand that in order to strive for a bright future for the Chinese nation, it is absolutely not necessary for the vast working masses to bear a heavy responsibility, because there are many big figures kowtowing and bowing before the (god of war) who (upholds justice) and (guarantees peace), and there is also this group of young masters who are striving to save the country and are willing to fall at the feet of women, entrusting their patriotism to the goddess of love. If China still must perish, it would truly be too unreasonable.</p>
<p>As for Miss Chen Ruihua, the socialite, loving her country through love letters and charm, it adds even greater glory to our nation. For example, during the First World War, Germany had some female spies who did not hesitate to use their charm to gather enemy intelligence. Even when the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing, our country also had an unofficial history of prostitutes saving the country. Therefore, beauties saving the country is something that has happened throughout history. There is no need to imitate Mulan and fight on the borderlands amidst the lamentations of Hu Jia and warhorses. Even in the midst of overflowing love and the intoxicating aroma of champagne, one can fulfill a woman's duty to save the country. Compared to the heroines who embroider poems on the tunics of soldiers, how can they be compared?</p>
<p>Since this is the case, such beautiful women and beautiful deeds are of course worthy of being recorded in history to be immortalized. However, before the history of this national crisis has even begun to be compiled, we record it in writing, which is of course also a great merit. Moreover, this is an iron proof that China will not perish. From now on, patriotic people who are worried about the country and the times can rest easy.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Random Notes on Fundraising <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Pengnian</p>
<p>Since the news of the fall of Chengde reached our school, the atmosphere of anti-Japanese national salvation in our school has suddenly become tense again. The self-proclaimed patriotic general Chen is running around and shouting, extremely busy. The dancing doctorate Dong has not been to the amusement palace for several days, as if realizing that dancing alone cannot save the country. The political figure Mr. B is also spouting his wonderful theories of national salvation. The student union and the comrade association are all working hard to carry out anti-Japanese work. Judging from the situation, there is no one in our school who is not doing the work of resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Chen invited me to join their fundraising team. Of course, I couldn't refuse. After breakfast, I followed them to Avenue Joffre, soliciting donations from house to house along the way. At the intersection of Rue Amiral Courbet, a pair of Western-dressed animals came towards us, holding the hand of a fashionable lady with a peachy face and apricot lips. When we saw them, we were extremely welcome! We issued an emergency mobilization order, surrounded them heavily, and stretched out our hands like beggars to ask for money. Alas! Originally, in our ideal, we thought we could certainly win their sympathy and get them to donate some money, but the reality often exceeded expectations. Not only did they not give a single penny, but one of them, wearing full silk-rimmed glasses, scolded us and said: (Shameless things, asking us for money, slow down! slow down!) When we heard this, we were really angry. What do they take us for? How hateful and deplorable!</p>
<p>After lunch, we headed towards Nanking Road. At the intersection of Route Maetthaeur, the Lu family made us angry again. Logically, (when we entered the door, we should first say a few flattering words, and then talk about how loyal and brave the volunteer army is in killing the enemy! How saving the country is saving oneself! How donating military funds is better than chanting Buddha and burning incense, and so on. After shouting all this, then shout a few times to the old man and old woman, asking them to generously donate and participate in this good cause.) After we said the above paragraph once, twice, but they looked at us as if we were something, not saying a word or answering. After we shouted more than ten times (old man and old woman), they finally showed their mature air and said to us:</p>
<p>(You students are really not good at yourselves, unwilling to study hard, and like to do this kind of thing.) (Now that you are here, take two dimes.) After saying this, they took out two small silver coins from their pocket and gave them to us. We had no choice but to leave resentfully under their contemptuous gaze.</p>

<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Slowly walk, slowly walk!</p>
<p>Where do you live? Tell me;</p>
<p>Oh, looking at you, you are quite pretty. You are probably getting along in years this year, very good;</p>
<p>Hey, what's the reason; are you walking faster? Open socialising, having friends is also good!</p>
<p>Let's go open a room.</p>
<p>The time is dusk. From the moment the grey-blue is about to emerge from the east, groups of female workers on the road are all squeezing towards that huge and solemn factory. Yes, driven by hunger and dominated by the environment! Some are walking slowly through the dense fog on wheelbarrows, and some are far away from the factory; even riding wheelbarrows is impossible, so the extent of their suffering can be imagined. The workers, who live like cattle and horses, have now finished their twelve hours of work and are leaving work! She, walking towards her destination home, yawned a few long yawns, obviously her spirit was extremely exhausted, but when she goes home from work every day, someone is always entangled with her, a white-faced little fat man is stalking her, hoping to eat a piece of her flesh! Naturally, today will be no exception, he is behind her, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, chasing after her with a smiling face.</p>
<p>Because her home is far away from the factory, every time the little fat man stalks her for a hundred or two hundred steps, the result is only enjoying her cold and sharp glares.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The factory whistle blares, and from this sound a group of extremely tired female workers emerge. So the white-faced little fat man is about to start doing his daily homework 丨丨 stalking.</p>
<p>(Hey, girl. It's awfully cold today. Is sleeping alone cold? Okay, let's go open a room to play.)</p>
<p>(Old man, do you know who I am? Get lost!) Her husband, who had been avoiding her from afar, walked up to the little fat man and said. This was just to warn him that she was a married woman, and that a toad should not think of eating swan meat.</p>
<p>(Damn it. Okay, I recognise you, what are you going to do?) At this time, the little fat man became angry and asked back fiercely.</p>
<p>(How unreasonable, you dare to flirt with my woman?)</p>
<p>(Your woman? Heh!)</p>
<p>(You Don't believe it? Do you really want to stalk) me? Bastard!</p>
<p>(Bullshit!)</p>
<p>(Hmm!)</p>
<p>(Hit him, everyone come, hit this pig.)</p>
<p>(I'm hurt, I'm hurt!) she shouted. Suddenly, several fellow men rushed from the west and together they punched and kicked her husband violently. Although he struggled desperately to the death, he could not defeat them. In a moment, he lost consciousness and could not move, falling to the ground! She cried out in shock, (Thank you! Oh no, it's really going to turn into murder, stop it! Stop it.)</p>
<p>He is hurt, he is really hurt; from now on, where will she have the courage to go to work? Alas, (stalking) is so harmful!</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Near dusk, a gust of wind blew up, and the small road in front of the door leading to the market town was full of flying dust. The children of the neighbors were calling out to their livestock. In this small village, raising livestock is their only occupation, and every family has hundreds or ten chickens and ducks, which is a common thing. Their parents for food and clothing all year round are on the livestock, so their guarding against livestock is the first big thing. If they find traces of a weasel nearby, they are even more on guard day and night.</p>
<p>Zhenmin was sitting on the stone steps in front of the door, thinking about what happened last year</p>
<p>On a snowy day, Dad, Mom, and himself searched all over for a chicken that had been lost at dusk, and later found the chicken drowned in the water by the riverbank. Dad picked up its stiff legs and smiled and said: (A good feast.)</p>
<p>Li Zhenmin's family is the wealthiest in the village, and their life is of course a little more comfortable than ordinary families. His dad likes to drink a little wine, and every night, the three of them eat around a table. The old man, holding his wine glass, chats about the wild stories he heard from the small tea houses in the market town. His wife and son often listen in a trance. So the old man playfully said: (Don't talk tomorrow, I'll kill a chicken to go with the wine). As a rule, in this village, eating chickens and ducks is not a rare thing, but Li Zhenmin's mother is a person who likes to be vegetarian and recite Buddha. She said: (Our family depends on them to make a living, and we still have to kill them for ourselves to eat, Amitabha! The old man twirled his beard and said: (Selling them to others is also one head per knife.) (That is the sin that others bear!) This is the old lady's reason for reciting the Buddha. So the old man said helplessly, (Cook two chicken eggs, I'll do good deeds to avoid one head per knife in the future.) Li Zhenmin couldn't help but laugh at this time. But the old lady still said solemnly: (Doing good deeds will have good rewards!) So when the old man found the drowned chicken, he smiled and said: (A good feast:)</p>
<p>Li Zhenmin was sitting on the stone steps in front of the door, thinking about what happened last year:</p>
<p>Three days after eating the chicken, Dad caught a cold from the wine and was bedridden, feverish, and delirious. Mom joked and said: (You're greedy for chicken, and the old man in the sky is punishing you with two days of illness.) People in the countryside originally regarded fever and cold as common occurrences, and they would get better by eating a little ginger and brown sugar soup. However, Dad's illness did not improve, but worsened every day. Mom became anxious and went to the market to invite a famous doctor. The doctor said that the cold had entered the spleen and stomach, and the prescriptions he prescribed were all very expensive. Dad was ill for three months, and Mom was so thin that she was out of shape. All the chickens and ducks were sold at a low price because they needed money in the cold weather, but Dad finally died of his illness.</p>
<p>He saw the children of the neighbors calling out to their livestock in the dust, and he couldn't help but shed tears. His mom called him from the house to come in and eat. He wiped his tears and saw two bowls of porridge on the table. Mom asked him why his eyes were red. He said that sand had blown into them. The mother and son ate the meal in a haphazard manner and went to bed. Zhenmin thought to himself that there was still porridge to drink today, but what would they eat tomorrow? Hearing Mom tossing and turning in bed, he decided on an idea, staring at the top of the mosquito net waiting for Mom's snoring.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dogs in the nearby village barked madly, and the old lady woke up from her sleep. There was already the sound of banging on the door, shouting for her son, but there was no answer. He vaguely heard outside the door: (Old woman, come out, your son has done something</p>

<h3 id="e267">Marrying a Cousin <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I have a difficult matter, and I would be grateful if you could take the trouble to answer it. The fact is this: I was eleven years old when my father passed away; thanks to my uncle's upbringing, I studied with my cousin. I have two female cousins, and my second cousin has a very good feeling for me. When I lived in her house, she took good care of me. All my clothes were washed and made by her: and when I had free time, we would talk and laugh, which was very happy. Time passed quickly, and in a blink of an eye I was seventeen years old, so I entrusted a relative or friend to recommend me to a yarn shop in this port to learn a trade: it has been five years since then. In these five years, I have often gone to her house, and we are not too estranged. Last September, my aunt suggested to me that she was willing to betroth my second cousin to me, and told me to work hard at my studies and save money to prepare for our marriage in the future. At that time, because I was still young, and I didn't know what my cousin's intentions were, I didn't agree immediately. Another reason was that I knew myself that I was a person without permanent property, and I didn't have much ability to serve society, so I couldn't get a reward to support my family. Even if I got married, I wouldn't have any happiness, and I would be harming my second cousin. Now I have an opportunity to find out what my cousin's intentions are: she said that she is willing to marry me; and she said that her father is a little unwilling, but with her and her mother's intentions, her uncle has no way to stop it. Three years ago, there was an American student studying abroad, who was the son of my uncle's friend, and my uncle had a great interest in marrying my second cousin to him, but my cousin was unwilling. She said that she would rather suffer with me than enjoy happiness with him. This is what she just told me now, expressing her heart. Sir, I am already twenty-one years old now, but I am still a small employee in a store, with a monthly salary of five yuan; in the near future, it will be very difficult to organize a family. But she keeps saying that she is willing to marry me. I have told her that I cannot marry you until my economic ability is sufficient to organize a family. She said that she is willing to wait for me. I advised her to find another suitable husband, and she said (I would rather die, and it is impossible to marry another person). Sir, I have now told you all the facts, and I hope you can answer the following questions for me.</p>
<p>(1) What kind of method can I use to persuade her to marry someone else?</p>
<p>(2) If she insists on not agreeing, how should I treat her? Because in the near future, I will not have the ability to support a family, and I do not want her to waste her precious youth.</p>
<p>(3) She and I have a blood relationship. Although there is no explicit provision in the law prohibiting marriage between cousins, I think that the children born in the future will be affected by the relationship between the parents' bloodline, and there will be some physiological impact. I wonder if you think so?</p>
<p>I hope that you will answer the above three questions in detail. I am very much looking forward to it. I wish you</p>
<p>Peace Shen Shichang bowed</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Zhao Jun's cousin, because she grew up with Zhao Jun since she was a child, she certainly has an accurate understanding of everything about Zhao Jun. Judging from the fact that she is willing to marry him, Zhao Jun must have some outstanding qualities; that is why she is willing to endure some hardships now. We can see this lady's eyesight from the fact that she does not admire vanity and is unwilling to marry a foreign student. We see that more than half of the foreign students have been abroad, so their vision is naturally very high. At the very least, unless you are a college student, you are qualified to be his wife. Zhao Jun's uncle is still thinking about it, which is really pitiful. Therefore, although Zhao Jun's uncle may have some objections, it is not a problem. Moreover, judging from the letter, your aunt and cousin seem to be able to control your uncle! As for the current income, it is not enough to organize a family: fortunately, your cousin is willing to wait. The ancients said (a man marries at thirty), Zhao Jun is now twenty-one years old, and it is not too late to wait another nine years; in these nine years, with his own efforts, success is not difficult. Because your cousin is older than you,</p>
