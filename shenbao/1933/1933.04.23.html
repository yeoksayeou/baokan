<p>經濟恐慌之深刻化</p>
<p>美國自金融恐慌風潮發生後。曾暫時禁止現金輸出。藉以緩和金融恐慌。並阻止其繼續擴大。但未表示就此脫離金本位制。或即採取通貨膨脹政策。蓋美國金融資本家爲其本身利益打算。此刻尚無廢止金本位制之必要。而債權之收回。且以保持原狀爲有利也。然世界經濟恐慌。日益深化。究竟伊於胡底。樂觀者雖有種種立見好轉之推測。惟自去年以來事實之所題示。已證明其缺少確實性。</p>
<p>現在美國産業恐慌之深化。竩爲停止金本位制度之最大前題。設使不能施行通貨膨脹政策者。則一般産業。將陷於不堪收拾之境地。在産業界之於通貨膨脹。乃屬當然實行之政策。而金融界想望。則殊相反。至少亦以爲時期未到。應稍緩須臾以待時局之轉變如何而後定。然而現代經濟機構。乃以産業關係爲基本組織。金融關係。不過最上層之結構。故單就金融關係之利害。謂爲無停止金本位制度之必要。遂蔑棄産業界之需求。非但於理不合。且亦違背事實。在資本主義高度發展國家中。現代經濟組織。以金融與産業二者爲有機的組織。其相互關聯。甚至不可分離。而具有現代經濟組織之核心。占最基礎之底力者。乃産業關係而非金融關係也。</p>
<p>美國産業恐慌之程度何如。勿用贅述僅以（一九一四年爲基準）其物價指數。本年二月跌至七二·○。以（一九二三至二五年爲基準）其生産指數乃跌至五九·九。此雖爲抽象的産業恐慌之數字顯示。就一般人民生活狀况而論。除極少數人外。莫不呌苦連天。走頭無路。失業饑民。到處皆是。本年三月金融恐慌爆發後。大企業之破綻。層出不窮。實爲過去三年半以來之最惡劣現象。如不能於最短時期中克服此産業恐慌者。今後企業破敗。將愈顯露。金融恐慌。亦必在潛行醖釀之中。一遇機會。勢必一發而不可收拾。此則金本位之最大威脅。亦導發資本主義爆破之一巨彈也。是故美國當局。不能不急謀挽救。於是美總統公然提議恢復禁止金輸出之命令。同時即實際的放棄金本位制度。另一方面。即施行通貨膨脹政策。美國此舉。希冀收得如下之結果。第一貨幣價値貶低之後。物價可以提高。第二通貨膨脹政策實行之後。産業界因而有復興之機緣。第三美金所含純金量减低。其對外貿易。可以擴張。第四戰債或將易於收回。第五衝破關稅墻壁。開拓貿易市塲。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十一日紐約電英首相麥唐納偕女公子及英國代表團團員一行、搭（倍倫伽利亞）號郵船已於午前十時三十分行抵紐約、英駐美大使林特賽爵士·大使館人員·國務院代表·新聞記者均上船歡迎、麥氏向報界聲稱、渠此來挾睦鄰及合作精神與俱、與一九二九年渠來美訪問胡佛總統時無異、至美國放棄金本位一舉、對於渠與羅斯福總統未來談話、不至有何影響、至少就渠所得不完全消息視之爲然云云、麥氏旋與林特賽等搭汽船渡赫貞河、並不在紐約登岸、而直接由傑賽城乘專車逕往華盛頓、途中林特賽大使當以美國放棄金本位後所造成之局勢、向麥氏說明、抵華府後、麥氏將立即前往白宮、晚間由羅斯福總統設宴爲之洗塵、羅麥二人間第一次政治談話、將於宴後舉行、羅斯福總統日前稍感風寒、今已全愈、將於星期日偕麥唐納乘遊船往波多瑪克河上遊覽、船上二人即可密談、此與前次麥氏來美時、胡佛總統邀之同往賴比屯别墅密談、前後如出一轍、大衆希望談話結果、滿佈親密空氣、雙方亦能互相諒解、</p>
<p>路透二十一華盛頓電英相麥唐納一行人衆今晚已抵美京、諸人於火車程中曾研究美國最近之發展、國務卿赫爾曾在車站迎迓、旋導諸賓驅車至白宮、羅斯福總統破例偕其夫人及女公子逹爾夫人迎之於正門廊下、英相之致詞、曾在白倫斯里亞號郵船播音至美、已引起美國人民極佳之印象、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十一日華盛頓電據消息靈通方面所稱、美國政府對於未來華府談話所討論各問題、已决定應採取之態度、（一）（戰債問題美國政府按照民主黨政綱、不得不將取銷戰債之議、確定予以拒絶、但對於戰債减少或暫緩停付、則不予拒絶、在政府之意、戰債問題不過全球經濟狀况中一分子而已、（二）（貨幣問題）美國政府以爲穩定匯市、實爲重振世界商業之根本條件、故美國準備修訂稅率、但他國亦當同時修訂、（三）（銀價問題）美政府準備與各國討論提高銀價之方法、而複本位制、若各國皆予採用、則美國亦準備加以考慮、（四）（軍縮問題）美政府以爲各國負担鉅額軍費、實係恢復經濟均衡種種努力之障碍、故對於任何裁减軍備之發動、當予援助、</p>

<p>至於英相麥唐納方面除提議國際總恢復金本位外、料將同意於普減關稅及各國對於關稅之審愼調整、並聞麥氏將堅持倘若關稅普減後、必須遵行均等原則、惟此均等問題亦幾與貨幣問題有同様困難、因若英國認爲均等後、美國會或將認爲不均等、例如現有許多物品英國徵稅百分之三十、而美國則徵百分之六十、惟麥氏之所欲、乃在過高稅率之切實減輕、對於專爲稅收目的而徵抽之稅、似乎尚居其次、至關於戰債則英國現信前此協定、並未以國際均等爲基礎、故麥氏將要求不論訂方何種新協定、必將以均等爲根據、又將述可以一勞永逸之最後解决辦法、在解决之時、不以所謂（繁榮指數）者爲根據、亦毋須問及付欵能力、因麥氏認此兩項在各國時時發生變化、故不能作爲解决之根據、至於金融問題、因其與國際商務有重要關係、聞將首先討論云、</p>

<p>國民二十一日柏林電此處財政界曾發表半官式之布告、對於美金低落後國際幣制現狀、加以詳細之分析、而其結論則爲現在美金價格之降落、其原因不在國際貿易或資財之移動、此舉實爲美當局之一種具有深遠用意之策略、該布告復謂美國之事變、於德國之出口業能有不利之影響、蓋美金降落之後、出口品可以貶價賤賣或厲行傾銷政策、前例如英國之廢止金本位、蓋甚明顯也、但德國方面亦有微利可圖、如對外債務因金元價賤之故、亦可减輕也、至於德國對於美國之行動、則絶無效尤之意、而德國政府無論如何、必能堅持其國家銀行總裁日前所宣布之原則、即德國人民之以儲蓄之資存於銀行者、儘可高枕無憂、因國家銀行處處審愼將事、力圖維持存户之利益而不危及其存欵也、</p>

<p>定本月二十六日宣判</p>
<p>（各被告之抗辯）</p>
<p>章彭吳三律師爲陳獨秀辯護畢時、已下午二時十五分、庭長宣告退庭、改下午繼續開庭辯論、下午四時正、繼續開庭、旁聽席較上午益形擁擠、書記官宣布開庭後、卽依次傳各被告准其抗辯、並由律師代爲辯護、茲將各被告之抗辯、及律師之辯護詞、概記如次、</p>
<p>（彭述之）彭道述反對國民黨及反對國民政府之理由、謂（一）國民政府未能取消一切不平等條約、帝國主義者仍管理海關、租界未收回、領判權未撤消、帝國主義者之軍隊、任意橫衝直撞、日本且侵佔四省、上海亦曾被佔一次、故必須打倒帝國主義、（二）各省軍閥、歷年内戰、人民痛苦、農村破産、城市經濟衰落、故必須解除軍閥武裝、（三）人民不自由、資本家不愛國、目前各地捐欵、均係平民捐出、資本家地主、則一毛不拔、祗有農工、才有革命精神、根據上述事實與理由、擁護民衆利益、並非叛國、如庭上擁護法律、應宣判無罪云云、</p>
<p>章士釗律師加以辯護、謂大致與對陳獨秀所辯護者相同、應補充者、（一）被告自認共黨、且反對國府、並非欲實行共産主義、乃因爲國府不能實行三民主義、法律上並無共産黨即爲犯罪之規定、故被告之罪、不能成立、（二）被告反對國民黨、未將三民主義與共産主義加以比較、且反對國民黨之理由、係因不能實行三民主義、危害民國緊急治罪法第二條第二欵、係指宣傳與三民主義不相容之主義而言、故不能適用、（三）且照事實上看彭並未做宣傅工作、因所印之刋物火花校内生活、份數很少、且政府禁止不能流傅、祇由其相信共産主義之朋友看看、所以他們祇有思想、並未發揮、卽云發揮、亦很有限、與危害民國緊急治罪法所規者、相去甚遠、不能適用、被告所說之理由、完全不站在共産主義之立塲上、而係因其愛國心切、甚且可謂愛護國民黨心切之故、無法律又引用判罪、請庭上宣布無罪、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯　、謂被告反對國民黨反對國民政府、並非危害民國、如不以國家政府及黨看作三位一體、或二位一體、卽不能謂爲危害民國、再者政府是進步的、且是無限的進步的、國民黨的成績、有的可認爲很好、有的也可認爲不滿意、决不能因爲有人批評而卽說他犯罪、至於文字宣傅部份、因被政府禁止、並未逹到目的、亦祇能認爲未遂罪、又不能適用危害民國緊急治罪法、</p>
<p>吳之屏律師辯護、謂被告之刋物、並未傅布卽非宣傅、檢察官之控告、不能適用、再研究學術、法律亦不禁止、應宣告無罪云、至此、陳獨秀彭述之均起立補充聲明章律師之辯護、以其個人之觀察與批評貢獻法院、全係其個人之意見、並未徵求本人同意、再亦無須徵求本人同意、至本人之政治主張、不能以章律師之辯護爲根據、應以本人之文件爲根據云、</p>
<p>王武王武繼起抗辯、謂我前次犯罪已判决與此次無關、本人因肺腸胃病脚氣病等重症、於十月五日保釋時、家人因錢用完已離滬、囑我出獄後即返家、我因窮困交迫、無法可施、適遇謝少珊、彼允許借錢帶我到他家、我同他妻子談話、她呌我養病、旋即被捕、謝非被告、可見已作政府偵探有意陷我、但是我並無行動、對于常委一節、選舉必有根據、現在並無根據、足見不確、開會一節、亦非事實、滬公安局證人說好像開會、每人有一枝筆一本簿子、現亦未提物證、並且搜捕時、祗有西探、並無公安局人員、現祗憑謝少珊一句話、那能作算、謝想做官、故不屑陷人以罪、陳獨秀彭述之都供過我並非常委、我從獄中出來、病重已極、何能做事、故說我開會、與說一病人得萬米賽跑錦標、同様滑稽云、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯護、謂被告於十四年加入共産黨、二十年五月在滬被警備司令部逮捕、判處徒刑六年、大赦時、改判四年、去年十月五日、因病保釋、十五日又被捕、保釋之十天内、並無活動、照事實論、獄中之犯人、能得保釋者、其病必甚爲嚴重、而非獄内醫官所能醫治、被告旣有重病、何能作政治活動、且被選爲常委、此乃必無之事、被告至謝少珊家、係去借錢且被捕時、正與謝妻談話、足證並未參加開會、且公安局說開會時、每人有一筆一簿、現在案内並無此物、謝少珊曾供常委五人均被捕、未有一人逃脫、則被捕後、卽無人消滅證據、何以公安局交不出證據、足見不能作爲參考、至常委一節、如係在獄前被選、則已經判决、如謂在獄内被選、則必無此事、至謂出獄後被選、則適間已述明病重不能參加政治活動、更爲無理云、</p>
<p>濮一凡濮抗辯謂我被捕時、是奉命去找曾聲偉、前任招商局總經理李偉侯、現押於獄中、庭上祇須去查問、卽可明白、我從未加入政黨、我在招商局很忙、决無暇參加政治活動、此有招商局職員簽到簿可查、至常委一節我根本不懂、陳彭說候補是蒲亦芳、四川人、與我根本無關、退一步講、如說我是共産黨員、我焉有在黨裹呌濮一凡、在招商局亦呌濮一凡之理、再就宣傅方面講、我編招商局月刋、庭上可查是否有政治文字、是否有宣傅文字、至庽内搜出箱子一節、箱子是朋友蘇少卿所寄存的、箱子上有他的名片、捕房於我被捕時、問我住處、我卽坦白告之、如我有反動文件、何能以住處告之、且捕房搜查箱子時、不依法辦理、更爲不合、我被捕後個人精神物質損失不必說、且老母因此眼睛都哭瞎了、女人及小孩、都無飯吃、請庭上宣告我無罪、</p>
<p>劉祖望律師辯護謂、（一）開會必有證明、上海公安局陸文虎說捕時、他們像是在開會的様子、這種不肯定的推測之語句、焉能作證、且筆簿等物、一件都没有、更無根據（二）候補常委一節、亦無證明、祇憑謝少珊一句話、亦不能作證、被告任職招商局、乃政府機關、焉有容納共黨常委之理、濮一凡蒲亦芳、聲音相同、當係訛傅（三）書籍部份、如果被告犯罪、必不將住處說明、且搜查時、還有陳巨來王曉春二人在等候被告回家、陳因無關、當時釋放、王旋亦釋放、至於箱子乃蘇少卿寄存的、箱中尚有蘇私人信件及名片、可見不是被告的、卽退一步講、是被告的、則所有反動書籍、按司法院五零二號解釋、亦不能認爲犯罪、故請庭上宣告被告無罪、</p>
<p>王子平王抗辯謂、被開除後、未加入托派、我印火花、因無法生活、並且我從第八期印起、如我是托派、則應從第一期印起、我失業很久、屢次投考、因人多不取、無法可施、乃去印刷、並且印刷工作、亦不重要、每次都由謝少珊拿來、印了卽拿去、我祇是解决生活問題而已、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯護、謂被告擔任印刷、祇是爲了生活壓迫、被告雖曾一度加入共黨、但决不能因此卽認爲帮助犯刑法上之帮助犯、在主觀點上、應與主犯連絡、客觀點上、應看其結果、現被告與陳獨秀等無關、祇受其雇用抄寫、且宣傅是靠文字、如謝少珊不拿稿去、他就不能印刷、故不能認爲帮助犯、應判無罪、</p>
<p>蔣豪士師律辯對各被告有共同聲明、（一）謝少珊在捕房之供詞、不能採取爲證據、謝是共黨要人、而自已不吃官司、他爲了要不吃官司、所以亂供、故不能採取、（二）各種證物全無、檢察官控告、全憑揣測之詞、亦不可採取、王子平部分、以前他雖一度加入共黨、但法律不追溯旣往、他被開除後、未加入托派、担任印刷、祇爲麵包問題、青年失業、政府及社會、均應負責、被告不負犯罪責任、</p>
<p>何阿芳何抗辯謂、謝少珊呌我印刷、我祇印一期、尚未印好、卽被捕、印刷並不犯罪、因文章有人作、又有人編、印後有人發、他們應負責、例如造手槍、手槍可殺人、但不能說造手槍者犯罪、我去印刷、完全爲了每月二十塊錢的緣故、且與我原業銅匠、並不衝突云、</p>
<p>吳之屏律師辯護、爲被告不負責、本人已說明、且祇印一次未完卽被捕、此種情形、危害民國緊急治罪法、並無規定、照刑法第三十條第二項、他祗是未遂罪、不應處罰、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯護、謂被告雖担任印刷、但不能即認爲加入托派、因無證物、而祇憑想像、不能作證、</p>
<p>王兆羣王抗辯謂、（一）謝少珊供說他家裹是共黨機關、他與我同時被捕、依法應與我們同爲被告、他另有目的、故有意害人、我雖住在謝家、但並無其他證明說我卽是共産機關（二）各種證物全無、不能搆成犯罪、如法庭護法、應宣判無罪、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯護謂、檢察官說謝家是共黨機關、被告若無關係、决不容其住在其内、此乃根據不確切之大前提而發生不確切之結論云、</p>
<p>蔣豪士律師辯護謂、滬公安局陸文虎說捕時、被告站在窗口、可見其非參加開會、且西探戈而特始終没有說過開會的話、可見陸文虎的話不可靠、</p>
<p>郭競豪郭抗辯謂、如我是共黨、何以搜我家裹毫無證據、再說學校豋記表、何以在滬高二分院·公安局·及蘇高法院、都没有提出、直到現在才提出、可見是揑造、表内說我一九二五年住長沙入黨、那時我尚在家鄕讀高小、根本未到過長沙、表内又說我十九年在滬加入托派、須知我在十九年底、始到上海云、</p>
<p>吳之屏律師辯護謂、被告是彭述之的弟弟、不能以兄爲共黨、卽說弟亦是共黨、須有直接犯罪證據、再豋記表來歷、卽公安局職員都不能說明、可見非合法根據、</p>
<p>彭望鄴律師辯護謂、公安局因被告被捕後、毫無證據、恐他要求賠償、故揑造豋記表陷害被告、</p>
<p>蔣豪士律師辯護謂、請庭上注意被告犯罪、毫無共他證據、祇有一張毫無來歷的豋記表、</p>
<p>梁有光梁抗辯謂我根本不是共産黨、且庭上亦毫無證據、請卽宣告無罪、</p>

<h3 id="c168">關於（農村裹回得去嗎）問題討論函件一束 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>（十）（五）本埠葉夢影君來信爲農村問題敬質朱天青先生（農村麥回得去嗎？）確是一個重大的問題，讀了在討論的幾位先生的文字之後，我深切覺到劉思明君的見解確實不錯，不過他没有告訴我們這様能回得去，當然，在劉君本人是知道的，不過不便於發表吧了，讀十三日的讀者顧問，發現了朱天青先生同情尤先生的信，我詳細地讀了他的文章，覺得朱先生却和尤先生在一鼻孔出氣，朱先生旣然讀過了劉先生的幾封信，如果朱先生不是近視眼，或者不是帶着有色眼鏡，其實早該明白的了，現在再來在尤先生的文章上畫蛇添足，實在是反爲不美，現在我從朱先生的信裏加以討論，諒朱先生也善意接受的吧，</p>
<p>朱先生也是主張創造（新式桃花源）的，不過他的（新式桃花源並不是不問政治，並且還注重鄉村教育的，因此他主張凡是覺到（久居城市中的人，或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣）的人，應該回到農村去，並且還是在（國難當頭）時節，倒不如去避世到（新式桃花源）裏去，丨在朱君的意思，顯明地表示出避世的思想，</p>
<p>旣然討論到（農村裏回得去嗎？）的問題，我們須要先求其明白，一農村怎様使得我們擠到城市裏來的？一問題上去，我們所以不容於農村的原因，並不是像朱先生所說的這様簡單，如中國鄕村教育不發逹，農民不知改良種子，農具的不良和軍閥的内戰，共黨擾亂等的祇知外表，不知内幕的，丨老實說，我們中國的糟糕，就在專門（人云亦云），朱先生不求明瞭一農村怎麽不容納我們）的原理，一唯地拼命再擠到農村去，試問尤先生的辦法，在　措大的我們，是否辦得到，除非朱先生是有産者，或有産者，能夠籌得到幾百元錢，回到農村去創一新式桃花源，）在我們，幾乎家鄕都没有了，請問那一塊地皮可供我們去創造新式桃花源，現在，我們在都市裏，吃的問題，尚且有了今天不知明天，那末怎様來籌劃幾百元錢，朱先生和尤先生旣然抱救世救人的宏志。那末爲什麽不挪些錢出來，給我們來創造新式桃花源，實在的，如果朱先生和尤先生確有救世救人的心願，能挪出一批錢來，給無家可歸的苦人回得農村去，創造新式桃花源，我現在立刻可以介紹你成千成萬的苦人，並且我還可以担保，就是你們薄待他們，他們也不至反抗，因爲他們現在比我還不如，一天祇有一個大餅，或者還没有吃呢，</p>
<p>農村所以不能容納我們的原因，朱先生所說的，不過是一些皮毛之談而已，其實在的原因，還在現社會的制度的關係上，因爲現制度不好，才造成軍閥的内戰，軍閥的内戰，才造成農村的教育的不發逹，農村教育的不發逹，農民才不知道改良種子和器具，因有軍閥混戰，而增加苛捐雜稅，苛捐雜稅不夠，還要勒令種植鴉片，公開勒令民衆吸鴉片烟，外加國際帝國主義的商品的侵入，形成了中國手工業的破産，而國際帝國主義因市場的爭奪，又造成了我國軍閥的内戰，而開闢了租界，協定了關稅，······中國農村受着這國際帝國主義的剝削和國内封建勢力的壓迫，試問呌他們怎様不抛棄固有的（舊式桃花源，）跑到都市裏來做工人，朱先生這些你明白了嗎，</p>
<p>明瞭了我們不能容納於農村的原因之後，那末我們再來瞭解現在是什麽社會，然後可以知道我們爲什麽不能回到農村裏去的關係，能夠明瞭了怎様不能回到農村去了後，然後始可以談救濟農村，否則頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，根本不是辦法，</p>
<p>在現狀態之下，無論如何回不到農村去的，（新式桃花源）不過是一班官僚和所謂　商們的人道主義的夢，旣不能回到農村去，又不能在都市裏找到職業，這就是現社會崩潰的開始，也就是未來的新社會的晨曦，出路儘有，不過那是尤先生和朱先生所不會也不願知道的，朱先生第二節上說得更滑稽，更矛盾，如果依照朱先生的意見，（破壞儘管破壞，建設儘管建設）的高見來說，朱先生你顯明地暴露了你理論的弱點，試問，假如我確是籌劃到幾百元錢，跑到農村去，實行尤先生的（新式桃花源）的計劃，然而創造未成，内戰卽起，内戰來了，共黨又來，土豪劣紳，剝削也接踵而至，請問朱先生，破壞讓他破壞，那末我的錢從什麽地方再來建設（新式桃花源）呢，朱先生你對於這様淺近的社會的常識，都不能知道，那裏談得到（新式桃花源），除非你要請一批（封神榜）上的天兵天將帮你忙，朱先生，你的（新式桃花源）固然要好過陶濳的幻想的（桃花源），然而你如果明白了現社會是不允許你建起（新式桃花源）的原因之後，我想你在白天裏决不致睡在床上，做這様的（春天亂夢），</p>
<p>在第三節上的前半段，我開始就討論過了，不必再說，現在且來談談美國日本的農村破産吧，固然，我是一個窮小子，非但没有出過國門，並且也没有到過中國的東，北，西，中等處，什麽美國，日本······的農民破産狀况，固然談不到知道，不過如果你我還能有讀一份申報的福氣，總該不致於健忘到了這麽程度，你没有看見美國的退伍兵向白宮請願嗎，你没有看見日本的農民賣女兒當娼嗎，你没有看見非洲人祇有一件遮下部的布嗎，······朱先生，對不起，我没有游過外國的農村，雖則我知道很多，恐怕你會說我造謠，並且太佔篇幅了，如果你願意知道的話，你不妨多讀些中外刋物，不論是社會主義的，資本主義的，祇要你不是近視眼，你不戴有色眼鏡，你總讀得到，使你知道，第四節上復有討論的必要，恕我不寫下去了，我一口氣寫了這些，自知是難免許多錯誤，不過，憑我的熱忱，以我淺陋的知識，所知道的寫了出來，很希望閱者諸君加以指教，使得我們没有進大學，買原本書的窮小子，多得些教益，</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>糼年讀國策，魯共公所舉的亡國四條件：（後世必有以酒亡其國者，色亡其國者，味亡其國者，高臺陂池亡其國者。）以爲這便可以槪括一切了。後來，歷史告訴我，還有一個重大的亡國條件，便是後世必有以高調亡其國者。但看，晉人的高調在清談，宋人的高調在理學，明人的高調在代聖賢立言的八股文章；他們努力於（豋峯造極）（高不可　）的空話，無形之中已下着一粒足以亡國的種子，到了相當時間，便開出一朶亡國之花，結成一顆亡國之果，這便是專唱高調的成績。做事要脚踏着實地，專唱高調是没用的；（爲政不在多言），做官不宜唱高調。（善易者不言易），學術家不宜唱高調。（怯戲鑼鼓多，怯人說話多，）（說嘴郎中没好藥），（會捉鼠的貓兒不呌），可見任何事物，切忌把高調欺人。近來的高調，成了一種時代的潮流，尤其是九一八以後，爲着迎合潮流起見，至少限度，也要喊幾句口號，貼幾張標語，這麽一下子，便可以抗日救國而有餘了。（殺殺殺，殺到東京去），這般的高調，大約言猶在耳吧。然而，事實怎麽様？打打打，打到北平來了！</p>
<h3 id="c201">酒和妓 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>酒是一帖銷愁的妙劑。無論心頭有多少塊壘，胸中有幾許牢騷，祗須酕醄一醉，萬事皆休。是多麽爽快的一回事莫怪劉伯倫要携酒荷鍾，有死便埋我之願了。就是平日間邀了二三知已，隄畔拾翠，郊外踏青，於杏花村店，淺斟低酌，也是人生一棒樂事，所以舉凡智識階級，和非智識階級，嗜麹　的，却佔十之五六，是很普遍的。</p>
<p>世上能有幾個魯男子柳下惠，所以性的需要，是古今一例的。但是爲禮教所防，界限所畫，處處感受着枯寂和不滿足，所以有這公妻式的娼妓來調劑枯寂的空氣，補充不滿足的性慾。况且玉笑珠香，媚行烟視，不曾眞個，早已魂銷，這也莫怪馬纓花底，要繋徧游驄的了。</p>
<p>天下無論什麽事物，有利必有弊。酒能亂性，尤其是歐美人酗酒肇禍，不知日有幾起。娼妓之在社會，有扇蕩淫風，藴染病毒的種種害處，所以美邦禁酒，我國禁娼，都是非常嚴厲的。但美邦自生産過剩，没法推銷貨品，失業工人，一天多似一天，成爲一大問題，政府不得已，便把酒禁開弛，啤酒廠日夜工作，紐約波士頓芝加哥的數萬失業工人，頓時受着雇用。其他推廣酒業，酒瓶酒蓋商標木桶的製造，在在需用人工，預計惠及失業者，當在數十萬人以上，此後彼邦可以稍减失業工人的騷擾，我國自禁娼妓以來，内地各項商業，大受影響，市面蕭條，不堪言狀，没有法想，也紛紛的申請當局，對於娼妓，開弛禁例，用以維持市面。唉！靠酒業救濟失業工人，把妓來維持商業市面，這眞是無獨有偶的不景氣中的怪現狀啊！</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>病從口入現在華北戰事擴大，長城緊要的六口，都已失守。敵人長驅直入，平津愈形危急。一個人不講衛生，飲食不愼，病便從口而入，一個國家不知衛生，平日設備不周，一旦爲敵所乘，病也會從（口）而入。古人成語，却應在今日中華民國的外患方面，眞是可嘆！。</p>
<p>家弦户誦！現居在都市的人們，眞是多麽的快樂啊！。凡是店舖住户，爲着求滿足人生的慾望起見，大都裝着無綫電收音機，　日問彈唱歌曲之聲，不絶於耳。這眞應了古人（家弦户誦）一句話了。但細味這四個字，好像是太平時代的景象。現在呢？亡國之禍，迫在眉睫，這種快樂的日子，矛盾的情形，正不知可能長久不長久！。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>中宵夢回，四野閣閣的蛙聲，聒噪得使人難以入睡。因憶唐人詩道：（黃梅時節家家雨，青草塘池處處蛙。）眞描寫得一些不錯！請你莫厭惡那聒噪的蛙聲，這種天然的節奏，在都會裹那裹能聽得到。住在上海人的人們，半夜裹醒來，祇聽得鳴鳴的摩托車聲；隣家的竹牌聲，這兩種聲音，俗不可耐。還有街頭賣唱的人，逼尖着喉嚨呌着；賣點心的小販，像梟呌一般的乾號，這兩種聲音，陰森森有鬼氣，還不如那蛙鳴的自然和渾厚。我幸虧住在鄉下，夜夜聽牠；抵抗···抵抗··的呌着。</p>
<p>我糼時讀晋史，曾記得晋惠帝問羣臣道：蛙之鳴爲公乎？爲私乎？後世莫不笑其愚騃。可是在現今問我，我敢代答道：蛙呌是公私兼顧，像喊口號一般，在公可以撈得一個愛國的美名：私的方面，諸位可心照不宣了。你們現在不看見無論開甚麽會，做甚麽事，總高喊着口號，口號喊過，這事便算完結了。喊口號的能手，端的要讓還這位青蛙先生了。</p>
<p>青蛙不但會喊口號，它也是實行抵抗者，那倒比人高出一籌了。不信，請看一列一段故事：（從前有國王乘車出游，轍中有蛙，聞車聲，證目而視，毫不畏避，國王命廻車避之。人問其故，國王云：我敬其男，不敢犯也。）這段故事是暗示着：你能奮鬥才有生路；一屈服便永無出頭之日。</p>
<p>青蛙高喊口號，我們已是凖會了；青蛙的實行抵抗，有幾個人肯去學他呢？人畢竟是比青蛙聰明呀！</p>

<p>— 張芷痕</p>
<p>（白蘭花！茉莉花！······）賣花女的嬌曼的賣花聲，傳遍了長街；傳遍了短巷。自清晨，至日落，賣花女的足跡，印遍全城。滿籃的鮮花，賣去不及一半，餘剩的，萎黃了；枯謝了。</p>
<p>（白蘭花！茉莉花！）賣花女的嬌曼的賣花聲，多少含有失望的悲哀的成分。（白蘭花幾文一朶？）（五十文。）（花呀！不及你香，花呀！不及你白。）浮滑的少年，借着買朶白蘭花，打趣這賣花的小女郎。（我賣的是白蘭花，你怎様說我白和香。）賣花女這般想；但，爲了五十文，不得不忍辱含羞賣這朶花兒給少年郎。</p>
<p>在清晨，露未晞，别人擁着香衾還未起；賣花女久已在花圃裏採採花兒今朝好去做生意。黃昏後。别人遊遍春郊已向家裏走；賣花女看看未賣完的花兒獨自在發愁。將花來賣錢，爲什麽被少年郎取笑在人前。有人提倡女子的職業，又有人說什麽男女要平權；怎奈一般的社會，不以它爲然。</p>

<p>春天來了，各種樹都發芽了，花也開得很茂盛，蝴蝶和蜜蜂，都在花心中採蜜。恰巧來了幾個小孩子，他們就在這樹底下開會，有一個小孩說：（飛蟲都出來了，飛蟲中最美麗的，要算是蝴蝶。隔了幾天，我們一同到曠野地方去，拿了捕蟲網去捉蝴蝶，捉了來拿針剌死了，放在匣子裏做標本吧）。許多小孩都很同意。</p>
<p>但是這些話，都給那樹上的蝴蝶聽見了連，忙回到自已的家裏，和他的同類商量說：（現在人類要傷害人們，我們再不抵抗，我們的種快要給人類滅絶了。現在應當一同去抵抗）。有一隻小蝴蝶說：（我們身體小，氣力微，怎様可以去抵抗强暴的人類呢？）衆蝴蝶對於這個問題，有些爲難起來了。</p>
<p>正在没法想的時候，忽然外面有嗡嗡嗡的聲音，原來是蜜蜂。他採了蜜回去，經過這裏，看見他們的面上帶着十分憂愁，所以他有意的呌了幾聲，讓蝴蝶注意。蝴蝶知道是蜜蜂，就請他進來，拿一切的事完全告訴蜜蜂，蜜蜂聽了說：（蝴蝶姐姐，不要這様的憂愁，到了這天，我來　助你們好了。）蝴蝶聽了這話，很是快樂，就送出門口。日子過得很快，那許多小孩都到曠野地方去捉蝴蝶，一隻没有捉到，倒被蜜蜂剌得好痛，就垂頭喪氣的回到家裏，被蜜蜂剌的傷口，隔了好幾天才好哩！</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>四月裏穿棉衣，天氣眞有點陰陽怪氣。詩正月：（正月（正陽之月，今四月繁霜，我心憂傷。）陰陽怪氣的天時，於古有之，我們自不得不（我心憂傷）。</p>
<p>元朝的大兵攻到杭州，在錢塘江沙灘上搭篷帳，宋人以爲天滅索虜，這一下可總解决了；那知江潮三日不至，元兵攻入杭州，此中大有天意云云。今年洛陽的風特别大，連練習飛機都不便當，非率隊南歸杭州不可。（見四月二十一日各報）風大不便練習飛機，這是眞的；孩子們春天放風筝，風一大，只好收起風筝免得斷鷂子；這點常識，大家總明白的。洛陽風大，此中蓋有天意！不過天意正未可知，洛陽風大，我們的飛機已經飛回杭州了；日本的飛機，看牠飛來一隻，吹落一隻，豈非中華民國無疆之休！</p>
<p>有人根據劉伯温燒餅歌，說：（宣統皇帝還有三十六年天下。）可見平津陷落原在天意之中。胡聖人呌我們等待五十年，聖人洩漏天機，普渡衆生，其恩無極。我們趕快躺下坑去，每人辦一根烟槍，一燈相對，方不至辜負胡聖人之好意。若不辦烟槍，而打哥而夫球，而跳舞喝香檳，而跑狗賭回力球，亦在休息之列，未便反對。五十年後，天意一轉，我們從坑上躍出，飛機從杭州飛出；日麗風清，烟槍所向無敵，鷂子永不斷線，中國便得救了。</p>
<p>所以天津陷落的天意另一面，即是東方文藝復興。君士坦丁堡陷落而文化西移，北平陷落而（文化）南來，君不見文藝復興大師早已出世乎！鳴乎，盛衰之理，雖曰人事，豈非天意也哉！</p>
<h3 id="c209">介紹賴納和他的（紅蘿蔔鬚） <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 烈文</p>
<p>我們在浩如烟海的近代文學名著裏面，單單選上了賴納的（紅蘿蔔鬚），並没有别的意思，祗因爲這是一部拆得開的，由若干短篇連貫而成的長篇小說，較便於編輯而且便於閱讀的緣故。賴納雖是在世界文學史上有着相當地位的人，但在中國却似乎很少有人知道，在此我得寫幾句話介紹一下：賴納的西文姓名爲ＪＵＬＥＳＲＥＮＡＲＤ，以千八百六十四年生於法國西北部ＭＡＹＥＮＮＥ省之ＣＨＡＬＯＮＳ地方，死得很早，享壽不到五十歲。但在這短促的生涯裏，他在文學上的成就已足驚人；他曾被舉爲著名龔古爾文學會（ＡＣＡＤＥＭＩＥＧＯＮＣＯＵＲＴ）十個會員中之一員。</p>
<p>從一八八八年起，他先後發表鄕村的罪惡（ＣＲＩＭＥＤＥＶＩＬＬＡＧＥ）冷笑（ＳＯＵＲＩＲＥＳＰＩＮＣＥＳ）食客（ＬＥＣＯＲＮＩＦＬＥＵＲ）等篇小說，到一八九四年，紅蘿蔔鬚（ＰＯＩＬＤＥＣＡＲＯＴＴＥ）出版，便名震一時，這部小說後來曾編成劇本，在舞台上更獲得極大的成功。（紅蘿蔔鬚）在法國，正如中國的阿Ｑ一様，成爲盡人皆知的典型人物。（紅蘿蔔鬚）是一個有幾分傻氣的不幸的孩子，生長在非常壞的家庭裏，受着重重壓迫；偏心的母親虐待他；自私的父親一向忽視他；狡猾的哥哥和姐姐也都利用環境欺負他。在這様的雰圍氣裏面過着日子的紅蘿蔔鬚，結果也漸漸地變爲得詭譎，懶惰，殘酷了。這書裏並没有怎様驚人的情節；賴納給我們的是一串筆調老練的連續的漫畫。畫中每個人物都經過正確的觀察，精細的解剖，各人日常生活裏許多不易爲人見到的機詐，或卑鄙的地方，都被表現在紙上。這様的漫畫，不單給人以感動，同時還使細心的讀者隨處體會到一種冷靜的譏嘲。著名文學史家朗遜（ＧＵＳＴＡＶＥＬＡＮＳＯＮ）說這是一種具有空前的獨創風格的傑作，並非過言。</p>
<p>因爲近年來國内翻譯的外國文學作品，很多不是譯錯，便是艱澀得使人不懂，於是大多數讀者，都趨向於許多容易消化的（創作），對於比較有價値的西洋名著，倒望望然去之。本刋打算在可能範圍内，刋載幾篇忠實曉暢的譯稿，老老實實做點介紹工作。（紅蘿蔔鬚）的翻譯，也就可以說是我們的一個最初的嘗試。</p>

<p>（四）俊叔</p>
<p>俊叔是比較遠的一個堂叔，我不大見到他的；在我的印象裏，他是那麽和藹可親的一個中年人，老撫着我的頭髮，問我孝經可讀完了没有。是我九歲那一年，他很頽喪的跑到我家裏來，跟父親談了一回就去了，回了寗波。八年前回去時見了他，他還問我爹好，媽好，弟弟妹妹好，還買了許多吃的東西給我那時候還是那麽雅緻知禮的紳士。以後每年鄉下有人上來時，總聽人家說到他賣了這個，賣了那個。從人家的嘴裏，我知道他已經賣了女兒，賣了墳地，成了一個連長褂也没有的光蛋了；從人家嘴裏，我知道他去年冬天睡稻草，差一點凍死在那兒；從人家嘴裏，我知道他是只有一個抽大烟的妻子，抽大烟的兒子，和自個兒一張抽大烟的嘴，一個瘦影子了。有一次，有人說到他的小兒子，仲壽，我的堂弟：（仲壽頂可憐，媽也不喜歡，爸也不喜歡，天天上鎭裏，拿了把破胡琴，唱着拉着問人家要幾個錢過日子的。那天他不知怎麽的會跑到穆莊來，站在武陵嫂屋子前面唱小曲子要錢。武陵嫂一瞧是他，便不要他再拉，給了他一元錢，他連錢也没拿，掩着臉走了，往後就不見了，不知道跑到那兒去了···）聽了這麽的話，那和藹的中年人又浮到我記憶上來，和一張愁臉一同地再不微微地笑着，問我孝經可讀完了不曾。爲什麽呢？爲什麽那麽善良的一個人會有那麽壞的命運呢？那天上高祖和曾祖的墳地那兒掃了墓回來，只見他獨自個兒坐在堂屋裏，别人都在房裏打牌，不理他。他們把什麽都藏起來，連茶杯，水烟筒也不給他，防賊似的防着他。我替他難受，去到裏邊去倒了一杯茶，拿了枝烟，剛想去到他那兒去時，伯母拉住了說；（快别去，他身上有蝨的）。可是我還是去了，把烟和茶給了他。他一聲兒不言語的抽着烟，低着腦袋，不敢看我。他坐在那兒很拘束的，頭髮長得披到儿上，淡淡的，神經裏弱症患者似的一對眼珠子望着地上，把脚縮在椅子底下。因爲他穿了一雙没跟鞋，怕我瞧見。好幾次把肐膊擱到桌上來，又連忙縮了回去，因爲肐膊那兒破了洞，袖口已經没了邊。臉上滿是愁　，肉都掛了下來那麽地憔翠呵！</p>
<p>和他直坐到傍晚兒，他只說一句話；（上海現在恐怕和從前很不同了吧？我已經十多年没去了）。咽下了一個太息。</p>
<p>吃晚飯的時候，只有我一個人陪着他，大家都避開了，怕沾了窮氣似的。只吃了半碗飯，他站了起來，說要走了。我拿了個燈籠給他，送他到門口。他看着我想說話說不出來似的。我明白，我拿了一張五元的鈔票塞在他手裏。他低下了腦袋，我看見兩滴眼涙慢慢兒的掛下來，掛下來。好一回，他才說：（孩子，老天會報答你的）。便提着燈籠走了。</p>
<p>他的瘦影子和那隻陰暗的燈籠一同地消滅在田野裏。（善良的人啊！）我那麽地太息着。</p>

<p>鷄</p>
<p>（我可以打賭，）雷辟克家的說，（奥洛林一定又忘記關鷄了。）眞的，這事我們從窗口一望就知道。那邊，在那大院子的頂裹面，小鷄埘現出　那開着的門的黑方影。（斐利克斯，你願意去把鷄關一關嗎？）雷辟克家的對她那三個孩子裹面最大的一個說。（我並不是在這裏管鷄的。）斐利克斯說。這是一個臉色蒼白，懶散而又怯懦的孩子。（那麽你呢，愛勒絲丁？）（啊！我，媽媽，我害怕喲！）斐利克斯和愛勒絲丁兄妹兩個幾乎都頭也不抬地回答着。他們倆伏在桌子，差不多額頭碰着額頭，在很有興味地看着書。（天，我多蠢！）雷辟克家的說。（我就没有想到他。紅蘿蔔鬚。去把鷄關好！）她給最小的孩子取着這様的渾名，是因爲他的頭髮帶褐色而又滿臉斑點的緣故。正在桌子下面要着的紅蘿蔔鬚，立起身囁嚅地說道：（但是，媽媽，我也害怕啊，我。）（什麽？）雷辟克家的呌起來，（這様大一個孩子還害怕！這才好笑啦。快去！）（大家都知道；他是像一頭牡山羊一様勇敢的。）他的姐姐愛勒絲丁說。（他是什麽東西都不怕，什麽人也不怕的。）他的大哥斐利克斯說。這些奉承話使得紅蘿蔔鬚驕傲起來了，他以爲辜負他們的讚許是可羞的事，他暗暗地在努力克服自已的怯懦。看着他躊躇不决，他的母親便說，再不去就會給他一記耳光。（那末至少也該拿亮照一照我啦，）他說。雷辟克家的把兩肩聳了一聳，斐利克斯則輕蔑地微笑着。祇有姐姐愛勒絲丁覺得不忍，拿着一支蠟燭送他到走廓的盡頭。（我在這裏等着你，）她說。可是她卽刻怕得要命地逃跑了。因爲一股風把燭光搖了幾下，吹熄了。這一下紅蘿蔔鬚便嚇呆了，他開始在　黑中顫抖着。夜色漆黑，使他覺着失明了似的。一口狂風吹來，和一條冰冷的氈子一様的裹住他，像要把他攫去一般。狐狸，甚至於豺狼，不是都在他的手指間，在他的頰上咻咻地歔着氣嗎？他知道這時候惟一的方法還是向鷄塒那方面跑去，他埋着腦袋，往闇黑中竄，摸索着，他摸到鷄塒門上的鈎子了。塒裹的鷄聽到他的脚聲，驚慌得咯咯地吵起來。紅蘿蔔鬚對牠們呌道：（不要吵，是我！）他關上門，轉身就飛跑，腿和臂都像生了翼似的。當他喘息着，而又驕傲地跑回屋子裹，在熱和光的底下，他覺得像是脫掉了一身沉重的滿是泥水的襤褸，換上了一套輕爽的新衣一様，他微笑着，意氣洋洋地，挺直地立着，等待别人的祝賀；並且現在旣已脫離危險，他便在家人們的臉上尋覓他們剛才流露過的不安的痕迹。可是大哥斐利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁都若無其事地在繼續着看他們的書，雷辟克家的却以她那自然的聲調說道：（紅蘿蔔鬚，你以後每晚得去把鷄關好！）</p>

<h3 id="c229">再談中國的病根何在？（下） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>我們以爲造成今日中國特殊病象的原因有兩種：（一）維緊民族意識性的各種制度的破産；（二）維繋民族獨立性的文化日趨於消失，關于制度方面已在上期中說過，現在所要談的是屬于文化方面的。</p>
<p>什麽是文化？我們應先下一個界說：（文化）二字在西文爲ＣＵＬＴＵＲＥ，凡一民族的社會風俗，生活習慣，以及宗教的信仰與文字用具詩歌美術等等，均得稱之爲文化。不久以前，蕭伯訥氏在上海與歡迎者談話中也曾論及中國文化的缺點，竟謂中國與東方苦無文化之可言。他說：（文化一義，如照科學解釋，即爲凡一切人類行爲之可以增進人類幸福者，尤其於大自然之控制，在中國除田鄉間尚可尋求其少許文化外，此外殊無文化可言，中國今日乃向西歐搬取許多已經失去效用遺害大衆之所謂文化）云云。一個民族的偉大表現，也就是牠的文化力量的表現。比如日本在明治維新以前，牠的國家也曾經過一度内外交迫的危險，但能及時奮起，上下同心協力的自救，于是日本竟一躣而維新起來。日本維新了，但是牠原有的武士道精神，則依然保持不墜。我們說起來這本是中國的遺風古俗，但這種代表古文化的風氣在中國是逐漸消失了，而日本則能發揚這種精神到促進國家進步的種種事業方面去。何以能如此呢？一方面固由于牠國民對于這種習尚的擁戴，另一方面則由于歴來主持文化運動者的竭力提倡，在小說上，在詩歌裹，在圖畫上無不直接間接的做着宣揚發揮這種精神的工作。</p>
<p>此外如實行共産主義的蘇俄，牠一方面是反對宗教，推翻舊制度遺留下的許多民情風俗，而另一方面則保存一切關于有美術價値的建築物，同時並竭力提倡種種關于平民勞工的文藝作品，政府更特設文化委員會，專司研究與宣揚的工作、其重視的程度，不在其他國防經濟建設之下。我們知道蘇俄共産黨的組織很嚴密，紅軍的組織亦極有訓練，在政治的勢力方面，可以說是很雄厚，大可不必怕什麽了。但是爲什麽還要如此注重美術文學的提倡？那是因爲所有黨的政治的工作祗可看見表面上的效果，却不能深人民衆的内心，而小說詩歌等文藝作品，則有濳移默化的功能。一個社會制度，必須要有文化的濳勢力　能站立得長久，否則是没有基礎的。</p>
<p>一個有古文化的偉大民族，牠的民族生命的否能絶續，就看牠能否保持與發揚原有的文化精神爲斷。我們現在來反躬自檢一下，什麽是我們的新興文化。什麽是我們可以自傲的，依然光明燦爛繼續發揚的，代表我們今日中華民族的古文化？從政治制度裹尋找些古文化罷，制度本身已破産了，什麽政治道德呀，氣節呀，亦早隨制度的精神而日趨消失了；從教育範圍内來尋求些文化罷，則專制制度所遺留的什麽君子之道呀，師生間的尊嚴呀，也早已破碎無餘了；從我們社會組織的基礎家庭制度裹尋求些罷，則家族制度的精神淪亡，是已不自今日始了，牠的崩潰的顯著，是最近三十年來人人可以看出來的現象。末後試再從蕭伯　氏的所謂田鄉間尋找一下看看如何。我們知道自採用機器生産方法的外國資本主義如潮水般的湧進中國後，我們二三千年來所遺留下來的農村文化古老的生産的方法就很快的日趨消失與破産的一途，尤其是在最近的十年中，崩潰的程度是一天擴大似一天，在未來的三五年内，或許會人于整個破産的境界，亦未可知。</p>
<p>制度與化文是有相互運用，相互改造的關係，在已失民衆信仰的混亂制度下，是不容易有新文化的産生，而同時在原有文化日趨消失的過程中，雖有意國的墨索里尼，法國的希特拉那様有堅强意志的領袖，恐也没有把握能樹立起一個紀律化的制度來。因爲樹立一個新的制度，仍是要以舊制度與原有的文化爲基礎。舊制度與文化的破産消失，新制度與新文化的産生就都失所憑藉了。至於究應如何來挽救這個危局，殊非這裹的篇幅所容許討論，但是全國上下能一致的拚死以求生，總比目前這様苟安待死的方法爲更有希望，則是可以預卜的一點。</p>

<p>— 棄連</p>
<p>說他們不是做工，却也是拿勞力在資本家那裏兜售；要說他們是在做工，但又不像一般的肼手胝足的普通工人。他們穿着公司供給的制服，掮背着滿盛着銅板的白布口袋，看去分量似乎並不沉重，可是八小時不離開肩胛的背負，却非經過長期的鍜鍊决不能勝任。這就是一般老於上海的人們所認爲進益很豐的職業者（賣票員）。</p>
<p>電車公司賣票員</p>
<p>我爲得要了解他們實際生活的情狀，有一天特地跑去找到我那位賣票的朋友；承他告訴了許多局外人所不曉得的實在情形。他說：（做我們這種行業，表面上看去是再也没有什麽職業敵得過牠；進賬又多，職務又不必定要受什麽人的拘束，時間也祇八小時，就是做寫字間的事也不過如是。但其中說不出的苦處，可就没有人體會得到。乘客祇曉得說賣票的（揩油）進賬大，却不知道我們是拿職業做孤注取得的代價······）</p>
<p>（···那你們爲什麽要輕忽職務去取這種非分的進益呢？）我打斷他的話頭說。</p>
<p>（是呀！你說的倒並不錯，祇是我們對於（揩油）彷彿已經認爲是一種副業了。明知道這様做時，會打碎自已的飯碗，但我們却並不顧慮到這一點，所成爲問題的還是在有没有乘客。）他大槪是說得興奮了，把身上制服卸下丢在一邊，又繼續的說：（外國人狡猾，中國人却也不呆笨；以前的賣票員（揩油）的手腕靈活，後來的更不推板。）</p>
<p>（那麽你們的（副業）現在更可以坦白的幹吧？一圙月怕不可以進賬一百多塊錢？）我見到他那麽得意的様子，自以爲總猜得不錯。</p>
<p>（哼！百多塊錢！那裏來的那麽便當的事這個世界？我們的工錢是二十三塊錢一月，這也不過是一個好聽的幌子，實際上每月能拿着三五塊錢回來，總算你的本領不錯。除非你不幹（副業），不然，寫字間裹貼出來的罰欵通告，連各人自已都渾然不知。有些新進的賣票員，初上車幾天當然是不敢幹（揩油）的勾當；不要說是（揩油），連賣票的門檻都還没有摸熟，等到到公司裹繳賬時，不是票子賣錯，就是銅板短缺，但公司是絶不會因你是生手而原諒這些的。眞的，這種（揩油）的副業，現在在公司裏簡直已形成了一個傳統的普遍思想。有時一不小心票子賣錯了，或是因乘客</p>

<p>— 景賢</p>
<p>今天興怱怱地出去工作，一家老小一天的衣食住行，總算承老板照應，已有了着落。但是轉念一想，萬一明天忽然打碎了飯碗，那怎麽辦？</p>
<p>吃人家飯，失業是同六月裏打幾聲雷，十二月裏下一塲雪，一様的平淡無奇，不夠資格與（一産三孩），（死人復活）的消息相提並論的。因爲老板之於我們小夥計，正如我們之於一頭貓，一條狗。我們對於貓，狗，有停止供給食料之權，老板對於夥計，當然也有停生意的自由。</p>
<p>我們當小夥計的，不想倒也罷了，一覺昨睡到天明，惡夢都不做一個。若是不期然而然的，心血來潮，想到了失業後的恐怖，便會連飯都吃不下，坑都登不出，頭一着枕，更夢見妻子兒女，啼飢號寒。討債信，法院傅票，米店賬單，雪片也似的擁進來。驚醒轉來，心房的跳動，大有破腔而出之勢。</p>
<p>失業的機會，正環伺着我們的左右前後。同顧客們一言不合，得罪了衣食父母，或是同阿大先生挺撞了三言二語，對不住，請你捲鋪蓋，另謀高就。軍樂隊，　，　，　，春季大减價，夏季大賤賣，外加十週紀念，特别廉價，不得了，縮小範圍，裁員减政，小號容不下大駕，於是不得不别做地步。即使靠總理在天之靈，外加列祖列宗的積德，飯碗没在大緊縮裏碰碎，依舊過着薄利多賣主義，一年三百六十五天的大减價生活，到頭來，老板無意繼續營利，到那時山窮水盡，也不怕不滾你媽的蛋。有時，隔夜還是好好的，但没到天亮，嘓，嘓，嘓，轟通，轟通，大戰開始。挨過了半年五個月，停戰協定簽字，老板辛苦經營的數十年老店，都已化爲灰燼，還有什麽好說。就算天下太平，市面給什麽愛國志士維持住了，却又偏偏自不爭氣，由傷風而頭痛，而發寒熱，張聾　已死了，時髦醫生請不起，直挺挺睡在牀上硬挺，每天一身大汗，三身小汗，即使僥倖寒熱凉清，也已是病了十天半月，離牀之後，有瘦如柴，有氣没力。正在這時，老板一封信來說暫時解雇，復元後再行聘請。其實，所謂（暫時）也者，也不過是一種門面話而已，揭開天窗說亮話，就是（我們不要了，你這病鬼。）但是若是你偏噴　都不打一個，有時也會夢想不到丢掉飯碗的。例如老板新納了一位尊寵，不免拖來了一批小舅子，小姨甥，或是阿大先生的老表，襟兄，不知怎地失了業，没處安插，都得要來覬覦你的飯碗。這種來頭大的（飯碗敵）是無法抵抗的。凡此種種，都會使得你想起了，六神不安。至於（保障）兩字，是想也不要想起，而且也不敢想！</p>
<p>擁擠，票子忘記了賣出去；查票員便鐵面無私的抓着你這些證據（？）報告公司，他這天的職務算已經盡了。公司却不管這些是非曲直，籠統的加你個（揩油）罪名，而罰金之重又常會出於你意料之外的。）他不似先前的得意了；綳着嚴蕭的面孔，微微的嘘了口冷氣。</p>
<p>（是的資方待遇雇員總是不客氣的；但假如你們）向没有這種（揩油）的習慣，公司總不至於會在（鷄蛋裏尋骨頭）；縱或要尋怕也尋不出來的吧？）我似乎想寛慰他，但又勒不住感情的把他責備了幾句。</p>
<p>（錯是不錯，可是環境逼着你非這様的做不可。而且有種陋規，更慫恿你不能不幹。開車的明要錢，查票的要吃黑，派班的要例規，甚至連掃車撬路的也得花錢。總之，賣票員是各種職員的財源，無往而不花錢，不然，你就要到處碰壁，什麽事做起來都給你一個不便利。試問這些開銷，家裹旣没有家私帶出來，除掉（揩油）還有什麽補救的法子？）他帶着質問的神氣，偏着頭，似乎急待我給他個具體的答案。</p>
<p>（唔唔！但你不是說查票員是鐵面無私的嗎？怎麽他又會吃黑呢？派班的更無所謂要給例規呀！你們還怕他不派班來做嗎？我想這不一定是操縱你們要（揩油）的原因吧。）我仍舊堅定着自已的主見反駁他。</p>
<p>於是他說：（我說查票員鐵面無私，是在車上查票的時候；吃黑是在他家裏，還要送到他家裏。派班的不送例規，雖没有權利不給値班，但要是你請病假，或因意外的事遲到了一刻，那却是他行使以公報私權力的機會；一革班就是三天，不僅損失工資，而且還要受額外的罰欵呢！）</p>

<p>當我一脚踏進我先生姨太太公館中時，劈拍的打牌聲，好像機關槍的掃射一般，頓使我打了幾個寒噤。我一眼望見我的先生，正在抽着他的茄力克香烟，目不轉睛的望着牌兒，旁邊伴着一位少婦，她是翠眉含嬌，丹唇啓秀，身上一股馥郁的香氣，醺人欲醉，當然這是我的二師母了我就恭恭敬敬地向她申述來意，並請先生回店的話，也都說了。</p>

<p>清朝末年，國勢之危殆，日甚一日，内則政治的腐敗，逹於極點，外則帝國主義的壓迫，越來越兇，中日一戰而後，中國差不多快要被滅亡。那時就有許多革命人物，起來宣傅革命，要推翻滿清統治，建立民主政治，以求民族解放。滿清政府見這情形於他們不利，於是加緊壓迫革命勢力，一面對帝國主義却不妨讓步。他們的口號是：（寗送外人，不給家奴）。這就是說寗願亡國，不讓你們這班革命民衆抬頭！你看，他們的心腸是多麽惡毒！當時還有一班奴隷走狗，也帮着滿清政府高喊：（我們不能革命，革命足以亡國！）可是革命的高潮終究阻不住，狂風暴雨終究捲來了，滿清推翻，民國還是民國！</p>
<p>這種（寗送外人，不給家奴）的事例，歷史上數見不鮮，舉其著名者，如一八七○年普法之戰，法軍大敗，巴黎被圍，那時巴黎最窮苦的下層民衆，都紛紛起來投入軍隊，奮勇抗敵，但執政的資産階級和貴族，眼見得這廣大的羣衆武力，對於他們很有不利之處，於是不惜割地賠欵，向普國求和，想先和外敵妥洽，再來鎭壓國内革命羣衆，但民衆反對媾和，政府乃不惜以暴力壓迫，民衆多被慘殺，其後政府軍隊暗至軍械庫，打算將民衆的軍械竊去，被人發覺，民衆革命情緒，益爲激昂，政府恐受民衆包圍，就悄悄搬出巴黎，退往維爾塞去，巴黎市民，乃開始組織新政府，這就是有名的巴黎公社。可是這公社對於反革命的維爾賽政府，並不加以嚴厲制裁，反革命政府就得從容佈置，並得敵國之助，進攻巴黎，結果巴黎公社失敗，民衆被殺在三萬以上。這是西洋史上很有名的一件事。此外類此者很多。大槪每一國的政府，遇到外患時，起初牠也許要利用一下民衆的革命勢力，但一看到革命勢力過分高漲，於牠本身有不利時，牠就會轉而和敵人妥洽，用盡全力來壓迫本國内的革命民衆的，這幾乎是已成爲一種公例。</p>
<p>九一八事變爆發以後，繼不抵抗主義）名詞而起者爲（共赴國難）。東也（共赴國難），西也是（共赴國難），自貴人嘴裏，文章裹，以至一切的報章雜誌，我們幾乎可以隨處聽到和看到（共赴國難）這四個字。可是怎様（共）法呢？又同誰（共）呢？我總有點疑惑。於是一班大人先生就下解釋道，要（全）民團結，不分階級，（共）赴國難；所謂不分階級者，就是不問他是革命還是反革命都可以聯合起來去共赴國難；再進一層講，要赴國難而剔除了反革命份子······那就不能稱（共）。所以我們要共赴國難，就不該剔除反革命份子，······否則我們這全民就（組織）不起來，就不能共赴國難。這話聽去是非常的巧妙的。可是，不剔除反革命份子可以（共）赴國難嗎？反革命份子可以和我們（共）起來嗎？朋友！當心受騙！不必翻歷史，且看眼前的事實罷！</p>
<p>可是先生皺着眉，瞪着眼兒，他恨恨的道；（你又把消息洩漏了！該死的東西！）</p>
<p>我有口難於分辯，祗得默默無言。（你回去！）先生發命令了。我祗得又把師母教他回去的話，重說了一遍。（你不聽我的話嗎？你可干涉我嗎？）先生握起拳頭，他黝黑的眉毛之間，衝出了一股殺氣來。啊！這又是一張多麽可怕的震怒的臉子！我顫抖地向後轉個身，便帶着失望的心情，踉蹌的踏上歸途。</p>
<p>呀！這是我驚悸的心兒，正同外面春寒剌骨的西風在交戰着呢！回店後，師母不給我吃夜飯，她說：（要是先生今晚不回來的話·）看她惡狠狠的態度，好像恨不得一口咬去我一塊肉似的！夜深了，壁上的時鐘，已經是十二點又二十分鐘了！我的師父纔回來，於是我的夜飯問題總算　　　　　　　解决。</p>

<p>於是我只得把手帕解開來，交給他兩塊錢。（不要！明天擺顔色給你看！）他把洋向地上一擲，似乎還嫌少。（先生，這不過給你買聽香烟吃吃，算不得孝敬。）（誰要你的香烟吃！）那麽，先生···）我忍着痛，再拿出一塊洋　給他，他終於收受了。（唉！費了半個多月的血汗，而所得到的代價，却竟是這様殘酷，這様微薄！）在歸途中，我不住的這様廻旋自思着。</p>

<p>人體過瘦過肥，都不是康健的現象，而運動實有改善身體肥瘦不均之效能。因爲身體的運動由筋肉之作用而行，筋肉愈使用，則其質愈强硬密實，彈力增加，纖維漸次增殖，同時可使脂肪質消失，所以不運動的人筋　維柔軟薄弱，因而减低作業的能力，於生活上亦有密切的關係。</p>
<p>至於發逹肌肉之法，最好行强力運動，如角力，柔術，舉重物等皆屬之。但角力要有相當的同志；柔術要有人指導：鐵啞鈴，石擔，健身鍊等在幾個經</p>
<p>濟上不發生問題的當然一切都可解决；若在收入有限。經濟不大寛裕的人，那就難了。所以我們不得不想一個變法的經濟的運動器械，來補救這個遺憾。　　記得前幾期本刋曾載了毁尊君的一篇（窮的器械），這方法雖還使得，但要費一元多錢到底還有點不大經濟，並且手續麻煩，使用的方法無變化，還有裝在天花板上這非但不美觀，而且太呆板了，所以我以爲還不是十分好的方法。　　現在我做了一件東西，可以當作健身鍊用。其製法如下：</p>
<p>（材料）長五尺大竹板二根（要揀富於彈性而無裂痕的），又長一尺闊二寸之竹板二塊，螺絲圈四枚，粗鉛絲一尺，籐皮若干尺（蔴繩亦好）。</p>
<p>（製法）先將長五尺之二根竹板，在竹白（竹青之反面）一面的　弧形刨平（否則必致折斷），做成闊二寸厚半寸之竹板二根。然後把長一尺之竹板二塊各在長五尺竹板之中心段，在竹白一面用籐皮緊緊紥住。如圖一：再將螺絲圈四枚在每竹板之各兩端各旋牢一枚，如圖二：再用粗鉛絲把各個螺絲圈都互相接連起來，如圖三。這様，便成功了。（用法）同健身練不多，可以搆成種種姿勢，伸縮筋都有。將兩手握住兩按手（見圖三）之處，用力向兩邊分開。如左右開弓式（見圖四），反手拉，平分，向上分，由下向上舉，由上向下拉以及其他種種姿勢。總之，都得隨自已的意思去變化，並無一定規則；但須注意之點切不可專徧於單方面的運動，致碍平均發逹。</p>

<h3 id="c242">歐美失業救濟策的一班 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>失業乃資本主義的必然結果。在資本主義社會内，它的經濟組織是建築在資本家的利益上面的。所以一切被雇的勞動者，只有在雇主資本家有利的條件上，才能出賣他的勞動力；否則，就要常依雇主的便利，可以隨時解雇，而成爲失業者。因爲在雇主方面看來，非這様不足以維持其産業上的利益，於是失業者只有度着他悲慘的生活。在這時候，國家没有保證失業者生活的財源，社會也没有扶養他們的義務，工會更没有長久支持他們的資力。可以說旣無自衛之策，又没有强要他人來救濟的權利，而只有自尋其出路了。</p>
<p>這様看來，失業現象固然是於勞動者絶對不利，但失業者不斷的增加，也足以使社會不寗，破壞社會的秩序，影響到資本家的産業上，使他也會蒙受不利。因此，資本家就不得不想出種種方法來圖謀補救，以免去這不利的現象。但是這種補救是否可以收到功効呢？我們只須先看一看他們的所謂救濟策。且以先進資本主義的歐美爲例吧。在歐美各國中，失業救濟策略有不同，但大體上可以分爲下列三種：（一）職業介紹職業介紹的經營者，除個人營利事業的外，尚有（一）雇主團體的：（二）勞工工會的；（三）慈善或公共團體的；（四）市立或國立的四種。因爲失業的擴大，常爲一般的，所以非廣設職業介紹所於各地，同時設一統一機關，以連絡管理之，頗不易收救濟之効。現時有這種統一制者，只有英德兩國，在法國，法律上雖有這種規定，，但尚未見諸實行。</p>
<p>（二）失業保險此制始創於一九○一年比利時之根市，後普及於法，德，荷·丹等國。茲將其始創者根市一九二一年的實施，列舉如次：（一）市立失業基金，這是對於已登記的工會，以其對於會員所支給的失業津貼的金額爲標準，而與以一定的補助金；（二）補助金額，一人一日以二法郎爲限，對於同一人，不得超過十日；（三）以其前雇主及職業介紹所之提出證明書，以證明失業非出於自已的故意爲條件而給予補助；（四）工會將失業津貼與補助金，先交付於失業者，然後每月結算一回，而請求其補助金於市；（五）關於失業保險的經濟，工會爲其明確，另備特别帳簿，而受市之檢查。此外尚有國家强制失業保險，現僅行於英意，奥等國。</p>
<p>（三）解雇限制此係戰後始有，其意乃欲抑制失業者的簇出，使失業者得有求職的方便。例如：（一）解雇呈請，雇主在業務閉鎖或縮小中擬解雇時，須先呈請政府；（二）解雇預告，使雇主照被雇者在職年數之長短，解雇時負担一時間前預告之義務；（三）解雇津貼支給，使雇主對被雇者解雇時，負担支給一定津貼之義務，其金額依照在職年數之長短爲標準。</p>
<p>以上所述，算是歐美唯一的救濟策。我們只須看近年來，尤其是在目前資本主義的第三時期，各國失業的激增，已經到了尖銳化的程度，就可以知道它這種救濟策是毫無効果，充其量不過是一種治標的方法，只能救濟某一部份的失業者於一時，而並不能根本解决失業問題。我們貴國當然更不必談，連他們這種治標的救濟策都還没有，然而失業不是已成爲一種可怕的現象嗎？　　但是，失業就眞的没有方法可救嗎？失業對於勞動者是命運注定的嗎？不，决不，它是有方法可救的，不過不是如上面所說的歐美那種的救濟策，僅從表面上去救濟，而是要從根本上去着想，那就是要毁滅那産生這種失業的資本主義的經濟組織，而代之以一種與此相反的經濟組織。勞動者在這種經濟組織中，才能免除失業的危險，而失業問題也就可以從此得到根本解决了。</p>

<p>— 竹仙</p>
<p>（頗有獻身舞台之志願</p>
<p>瑞典籍怪明星葛萊泰嘉寳，現在有兩條路可走：一條是繼續從事於影業，那就必須回到好萊塢，因爲惟有好萊塢，纔能出得起那重大的薪俸，亦惟有好萊塢纔肯出那高俸厚祿。還有一條路，就是放棄銀幕生活，而從事於舞台劇，這兩種路徑，是不能相並而近的，所以嘉寳在取捨之間，亦已經煞費苦心。聽說她最近已决定現身舞台。當然她的選擇，並不是城隍廟裏求籤求得來的，她必定有她的理由。我們現在拿來略略討論一下：　　葛萊泰嘉寳有一種很大的野心，她認銀幕上的世界，已被她征服了。她第二個要征服的世界，就是舞台。在她有了這野心，她寗可犠牲一切。第一椿在收入上，舞台所能給與她的萬萬不能及到她在銀幕上，所能得的薪俸。但舞台上亦有其他的報酬，爲銀幕上所不能給與的。</p>
<p>在電影之中，演員與觀衆的關係，係間接的，嘉寳雖然已在銀幕上博得盛名，但她總覺得没有看見，聽見觀衆直接的反應。所以她倘使能親身踏上舞台，她可以在脚燈之下，看得見千千萬萬人衆與台上響應的喜怒哀樂的表現。也聽得到他們讚賞鼓掌的聲音。她以前雖然極力避免人衆的攪纒，但現在旣有了這野心，覺得廻避人衆的無謂與怯弱。所以她在瑞典京城亦常常出來走走，習慣習慣，據說她現在已經不怕人衆了。</p>
<p>此外還有一個很大的原因，就是（不服氣）三個字。這事說來很長。大約在一九二零年吧，她從瑞典京城皇家戲劇學校畢了業。那時一般戲劇編製家對於她的戲劇天才，並没有注意。所以一班同學畢業後都由各公司聘去。獨這位嘉寳無人過問，這是她生平引以爲恥的一椿事。所以她現在頗想豋台表演，藉以證明當時那般戲劇製作家的錯誤。說句上海話，就是要給些顔色他們看看。</p>
<p>當嘉寳尚未得志的時候，祗有一個人看得起她，知道她的天才及她的可能性。他們由泛泛之交而成爲極親密的朋友。他替她改了名字。她從前呌葛萊泰，格斯泰芙孫，實在太繁重而不好聽了。他替她起了葛萊泰嘉寳。（嘉寳）是瑞典的一種糖果，小孩子很喜歡吃的。他替她起了這個名字，爲的是使人容易記憶并且很好聽。後來這位斯蒂勒先生的名氣，被好萊塢知道了，就派人去聘請他。但他很奇怪地提出一個條件，就是要聘請他，必連帶的聘請這位没没無名的嘉寳女士。好萊塢没有法子，祗好俯允所請。但是她初到好萊塢的薪水，祗有每星期一二百塊錢，還好像不値得似的。在此以前，嘉寳在德國影戲公司亦表演過，不過攝影員總說拍她的戲是難，因爲她上了鏡頭太雖看的緣故。她到了好萊塢，起頭攝影師亦没法使這位滿臉雀斑，身軀笨重的嘉寳上鏡頭。後來幸虧那一般理髮師，成衣師，美容師，化妝師，攝影師等聯合起來，將她完全改造了一下，然後纔能上鏡頭。等到第一張片子完成，她就一番風順，成爲好萊塢第一流名星了。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在資本主義制度之下的生産品，都少不了有一種彼此競腿爭的形式，雖然不一定是（以貨比貨）爲原則，但是旣經有了某一種可以賺錢的出品，那末自已一定得來一個類似的東西。這是說至少可以和它競爭一下。這一點是和有統制生産的社會制度完全相反的。</p>
<p>就電影生産來說，這種現象也很鮮明，特别是美國電影尤爲顯著。有誰以賽馬爲題材攝了影片，大家都來倣造，於是（賽馬）便充實了影片市塲。同様，不久的過去有了（一人猿泰山），所以現在也就有了（萬獸之王）。當然，這兩片的内容，少不了是大同小異。</p>
<p>以上也許是在本文之前所應指出的。現在轉入正文。</p>
<p>假如我們對於本片必須來一個比較嚴格的批判，那末首先得指出的便是意識的歪曲。我們看罷，所謂（ＬＩＯＮＭＡＮ）的主角ＫＡＳＰＡ給白種人和獅子一同征服了，在文明的都市裏給文明人玩弄一番，其後终於羡慕着未開化的菲洲的山林，不能離開他那野獸的伴侶，决然帶着他的戀人重返山林，再度着那種野蠻生活。關於這一點很明顯的是要將人類回復到原始時代，至少是同情（人獅爲伍），成爲一種開倒車的反動的東西。而且故事的本身本來也就是十分幻想，誰也不能相信，一個二三歲的孩童，居然能夠從一堆白骨中獨自生存，而不給成羣的獅子傷害，雖然他長大以後，能夠和獅子相友好。至於以人類來同情獅子，反而仇恨人類，這種諷世嫉俗的幻想，居然能發生於物質文明發逹到極度的西</p>
<p>方，眞令人撟舌不下了。　　在這裏很明白的可以證明，本片的製作者完全没有認定影片當有它的教育意義。反之，假如他們能夠將菲洲的原始生活，忠實的介紹，而加以正確的解釋，以及將少見的動物學問化，教育化的由銀幕上介紹給一般觀衆，那末這種影片，自有它的價値存在的</p>
<p>如上所述，本片是反科學的作品，無疑的是神話似的東西。在以科學文明自誇的美國居然有了這種現象，雖然是比較微細了一點，可是我們承認是人類的恥辱。至於在畫面上白種人壓迫土人的那種殘暴的行爲，正是他們自身的暴露。</p>
<p>但是在技巧上，美國製片商靠着大的資本常是成功的，如導演能夠以火和野獸的暴動，或搏鬥來使本片得着好的收獲；然而似乎是用不着我來說明的。還有一個游泳選手必然的成爲資本家生産的工具，也是很値得我們注意的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c245">評二 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>昨天光陸蘭心同時換映的（萬獸之王）（ＫＩＮＧＯＦＴＨＥＪＵＮＧＪＥ），居然哄動一時，可見人們對於這種狩獵片的特殊興味，並没有絲毫减少，牠本事上，頗有類似（人猿泰山）的地方。牠說許久以前，有一個糼童，隨獵隊出發菲洲，後全隊覆没，只有糼童一人，苟延殘喘。他長大人成人，終日與獅羣爲伍，他便被土人稱爲（獅）了。有一次白人獵隊，設了陷阱（獅人）和幾隻獅子，全數被擒。他被賣給美國馬戲　裹。獅人有一次逃脫了，遇見一位女郎，雖然言語不通，但已兩心相契。馬戲團主人，利用女歐洲名片（春江花月夜）之一幕，該片爲德英影業聯合出品，係一富胃美的力量的大歌劇，男主角傑克蒲拉，乃最近馳譽歐洲的一位大歌星，該片在歐美開映時，收穫頗佳，今聞片已運滬，不久將在上海公映云郎，用文化開導獅人，教以言語禮節。從來女郎與獅人結婚。獅人雖已受文化煊染，但極思回到菲洲去度不開化生活。所以夫婦二人，買回了馬戲團中，最馴服的一些獅子，一同到菲洲獅巢去了。</p>
<p>在本事編劇上面，似呼太不近情了。而思想上的矛盾亦已暴露無遺。照他說，我們人類是不應當有文化的，文明生活，不如野獸生活的率眞與自由。那麽我們又有什麽理由要求文化？爲什麽反對上古野蠻生活？更何必有文化中産生出的電影事業？</p>
<p>演出的漏洞，多於（人猿泰山）或（人獸奇觀）。導演的技巧上，雖極盡靈活的能事，但是他的疏忽也是無可諱言的；例如不數日，獅人竟能說極流利的英語，情理上就說不過去。獅人脫離馬戲團和買回獅子，完全暗塲，也極糢糊，還有馬戲團失火，並不躉延的燒，竟像四邊都有人在放火。體裁還新頴，將菲州獅虎和馬戲團，連續述來，非常自然，爲已往獸片中所未有，不過自始至終，只有大羣獅子，而缺少其他野獸，對於馬戲團表演，也是極少　到，終覺美中不足。</p>
<p>這種影片，最重要的是外景，牠取景的偉大，絶非其他影片所能及。攝影也好，鏡頭角度的巧妙，頓使日光都有美感。剪接上，也絲絲入扣，不斷的令人心緒緊張。起首描寫糼童得生，再寫獅人，不像（人猿泰山）的人猿突如其來。劇首的幾幕和大火一塲，都是這片子的高峯，除缺乏意識以外，大致的組織，尚不十分牽强。</p>
<p>主角獅人是游泳家勃斯脫克勒裴ＢＵＳＴＥＲＣＲＡＢＢＥ初上鏡頭，成績不錯，前半部絶妙，後半部過於温和ＧＥＮＴＬＥＭＳＮＬＩＫＥ與劇中野性未除的景况，不大切合，這該歸咎於導演的。女郎是菲蘭茜娣ＦＲＡＮＣＥＳＤＥＥ表情之佳，在全劇中爲最好，一種綿纒情致，眞非斷輪老手不辦。餘下的只有ＲＯＢＥＲＴＡＢＡＩＲＲＯＮＮＩＥＸＯＳＢＹＰＡＲＴＲＩＣＩＡＦＡＲＬＥＹ三個人略有片段的良好表演。　　這一張影片，對於那些（爲看電影而看電影）的人，是很適宜的。牠有良好藝術，可以欣賞，牠有令人快意的表演故事，呌人愉快······如果你滿意於（人猿泰山），那末我敢介紹你去。</p>
<p>派拉蒙是成功了，不過我認爲這影片多少使期望太過的人，有一些失望的。</p>

<p>在好萊塢這個熱閙區域，離婚結婚，是閙得不要閙了。於是人生所必須的衣食住三項，也閙成各種花様，供給新聞記者們在雜誌報紙上的好資料。新近全好萊塢又有衣服的競爭，更轟動一時</p>
<p>衣服競爭的幾個首領，都是好萊塢幾位有錢的明星。第一個是康絲登裴納脫。第二是凱茀蘭茜絲。第三是李瑕搭熙門。</p>
<p>競爭的方法，是穿的衣服愈合時愈好。時髦的式様，拿巴黎市塲做標準。消息愈快，穿的愈時尚。常常一二個鐘點後就變了式子。所以消息得到慢的就落後了。她們三人都和巴黎的無線電台特約了，供給她們最快的消息。</p>
<p>她們每人都極力的運動新聞界人物，多載她們的批評。但究竟誰最好，却没有定評。</p>

<p>— 訥</p>
<p>戲院中的大衆，聽見了這消息，喜歡得天翻地覆。女人們快樂得過份了，亦不知是哭好，還是笑好，但是心中受了感動，眼下着手，涙潄大家雷和走。而出了戲院。琪茵和瑪格雷亦雜在衆人之中，似潮水般在馬路上走着唱着。瑪潄格拉一位貴官在馬路上跳着華爾滋舞。　　但是還有一件可怖的事情，那就是天天看報上豋載的戰士傷亡的名單。第一次急急忙忙地看過了，第二次細細地。恐懼地再檢查着，深恐第一次一時的疏忽，漏了一個重要的名字。琪茵一行一行的仔細看下去，看到没了一行，没有羅伯梅理歐的名字，她心如一塊大石，落在地下。不久羅伯就凱旋回來了。</p>
<p>羅伯雖得生還，但此後的世事，正似走馬春燈，連一接二地變幻無定。第一椿最可紀念的事，就是女皇維多利亞之崩。琪茵還記得那巴金漢宮門外，深夜靜立的民衆，等待着女皇病狀的佈告。她每天看了報上所載女皇勢將不起的消息，覺得喉嚨中格格有物，但是勃烈吉斯恭恭謹謹的站在旁邊說：（英國要没有女皇，亦不見得就不成話了。後來女皇大行了，奉安的儀仗，經過大街上，琪茵率同子女，在陽臺看着。喬易忽然問着他母親：（維多利亞女皇爲什麽要死）？琪茵滿眶眼涙望着她的小兒子說：（因爲她極老極老，並且太疲倦了。）兵隊徐徐地經過，兩個小孩看見他們的父親領着頭竊竊耳語着。維多利亞的柩陳列在一輛砲車上，小得好似一個小孩子的棺材。喬易又向他母親道：（她生前一定係很小的）。琪茵連忙說道：（她是極偉大的，你不看她後面還有五國的國王，騎着馬在她後面嗎？）</p>
<p>維多利亞時代已告一段落，愛德華卽位了。現在的英國，已是另一天地。羅伯已晋封了勳爵。兩個小孩已長大了。勃烈吉斯和愛倫已經離開了僱主去開了一　酒店。在起頭的時候，琪茵還常常帶了小孩子去看他們，　妮小小身段，出落得似花朶一般美麗：但是勃烈吉斯已沉湎於杯中物，愛倫還竭力隱瞞着。他們自已開了店，已脫離了奴僕的階級，所以比平常人還要傲慢無禮。琪茵漸漸亦不敢再去了。咼字多少時，琪茵對於這一對舊日十分　信的僕人，已不聞不問了。所以她亦不知繁妮的漸爲多少墜鞭公子所傾倒，即勃烈吉斯的被人所撃死，亦毫無聽聞。（未完）</p>

They paused briefly at Tongxian, and are expected to arrive tonight. Song’s troops are concentrated in the Santunying and Cheheqiao area, holding the west bank of the Luan River. Yesterday and today, the enemy fired artillery barrages at the northern and southern Tuan Ting, which continued all night. The enemy vanguard infiltrated near Baitazhai, seemingly with the intention of attacking Santunying from the front. This morning, about six to seven hundred enemy soldiers attacked Saheqiao from the Luanyangcheng line, but were repelled by Tong’s brigade. The enemy Pu Mu Division is currently advancing towards Xifengkou and Panjiakou. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There was no fierce fighting at the northern and southern Tuan Ting this morning. The enemy constantly bombarded our positions with heavy artillery. An enemy joint infantry and cavalry force of over three hundred attacked our Saheqiao front line at 3:00 AM this morning, but were repelled by our troops. Three enemy planes again flew over Santunying, Saheqiao, Zunhua, and other places this morning to reconnoiter and drop bombs, causing no major losses to us. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua reports that the enemy forces at Xifengkou are actively increasing their strength day by day, preparing for a major offensive. On the evening of the 21st, the enemy bombarded our defenses at Saheqiao and the northern and southern Tuan Ting with heavy artillery, which did not stop all night. The morning of the 22nd was slightly calmer, with no infantry action from the enemy. Our troops are also calmly responding to the battle, with no losses to our positions. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, enemy armored vehicles heavily bombarded our Zhugezhuang area with artillery fire. Multiple enemy planes flew over both sides of the Luan River to reconnoiter and drop bombs. The enemy aircraft carrier has sailed to the Yanghekou of Beizaihe. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army east of the Luan River, in conjunction with over a thousand puppet troops, advanced along the railway line from Shimen yesterday morning, harassing our Zhugezhuang defense area. After our army retreated to the east bank of the Luan River, a certain unit of ours crossed the river from Donghuishan, cooperating with troops east of the river and righteous soldiers, to counterattack Zhugezhuang. Last night, the enemy at Zhugezhuang were cleared out. The remaining enemy forces retreated back to their original defense area. Enemy planes reconnoitered the upper reaches of the Luan River today, and scattered many absurd leaflets within our positions. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources today, the Luandong area now appears relatively quiet, and the so-called independent army shows no signs of advancing westward. It is said that this independent army claims to be a National Revolutionary Army, and recites Sun Yat-sen's will, but the flag they use is actually the former Five-Colored Flag, and there are Japanese officers mixed among them. It is now known that trains can travel from Shanhaiguan to Changli. The previous report that the railway near Beidaihe was destroyed is probably incorrect, or it was damaged but has now been repaired. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Britain and the United States Plan to Hinder Japanese Military Development</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Our troops on the west bank of the Luan River number no less than 100,000, and the defenses are solid. The enemy is reorganizing and replenishing in Luandong, with no intention of attacking westward. In addition, with the Middle East Railway train seizure incident, relations between Japan and Russia have become strained. Regarding the invasion of Tianjin and Beiping, they dare not act rashly. The situation in North China is unlikely to change in the next two weeks. The actions of certain traitors have not yet materialized. Our army must wait until it receives sufficient support from the central government before it can counterattack. Britain and the United States, each for the sake of their commercial interests, are very willing to maintain the current situation, and plan to use some method to hinder the development of the Japanese army and protect British and American interests in North China. The British are taking the lead in this matter. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japan's conversion of Lushun into a naval port, disregarding the lease treaty and threatening international peace, has certainly caused dissatisfaction among European and American countries.

<p>(Beiping) Shixia reports that at dawn today, the enemy fired about 300 rounds of heavy artillery at our Nantianmen positions, and used smoke bombs to cover their infantry, launching a fierce attack on us. Our troops calmly responded to the battle, and the fighting was extremely fierce. A certain division commander of ours has rushed to the front line to personally direct the battle. At 6:00 AM this morning, eight enemy planes flew over our positions to bomb, dropping over sixty bombs in the Dongtaoyuan area, including incendiary bombs. Nearby civilian houses were bombed, causing fires in many places. The left and right wings of Nantianmen are now a scorched earth of smoke and artillery fire. Casualties on both sides are heavy. At the same time, over three hundred enemy soldiers were discovered attacking our Simatai from Shalingkou, on the left side of Nantianmen. We have sent troops to intercept them. The high-ranking commander of the enemy attacking Nantianmen is stationed north of the Laoye Temple in Gubeikou. The enemy has machine gun nests in the Dongguan Nanshangpo and Hexi areas. There are twelve enemy tanks on the Gubeikou Avenue. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shixia reports that last night, the enemy team attacking the right wing of our Nantianmen at Badaolouzi from Pochengzi Dongtaoyuan was met with a head-on attack by our army. The two sides fought fiercely. By 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and was repelled by us. This morning at dawn, the enemy opened to reinforcements from Luanping of more than two thousand soldiers. Using armored vehicles to cover their troops, they fiercely attacked the front of our Nantianmen defense line, making contact with the Huang Division □ unit. For a time, the battle was extremely fierce. The enemy again used elite troops of about two thousand to hold light machine guns and circle around Pochengzi, launching a surprise attack on the left wing of our Nantianmen. Our army discovered this, and led them deep into our defense positions near Pochengzi, surrounding them in a mountain valley. The enemy was surrounded at both ends, and attempts to break through the encirclement were unsuccessful, resulting in very heavy casualties. News was received this afternoon that they were all wiped out by our army. The enemy in the front of Nantianmen is still fiercely fighting at noon today. Our army has the upper hand, and the defense line is solid. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning before noon, enemy troops fiercely attacked our Nantianmen Badaolouzi outer Great Wall watchtower positions. Fighting stopped slightly at 10:00 AM. At noon, they continued the attack, but it was not very intense. The enemy advanced from outside the Great Wall at Badaolou, circling in through Longtangou. A portion attacked our Jiepaiyu extremely fiercely. The enemy artillery fire there could not aid the attacking enemy, so it was not easy to achieve results. The battle yesterday was very fierce. Casualties on both sides were extremely high. The enemy selected Mongolian dare-to-die squads as the vanguard with heavy money, and Japanese soldiers used machine guns to supervise the battle from behind. When the Mongolian soldiers approached our positions, the Japanese immediately opened fire on our positions. Many Mongolian soldiers were killed or injured. There are five to six hundred Mongolian soldiers in Longtangou. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 22nd, the enemy pursued and advanced to Laoyingpan outside Huangyaguan. Li's cavalry unit of our army fought fiercely with the enemy, and Xiao Zhichu's unit will also make contact. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A phone call from Kaiping reports that at 2:30 AM on the night of the 21st, one hundred fifty to sixty enemy soldiers, carrying five or six field guns, launched a fierce attack on our positions across from Diaoyutai. A certain regiment of a certain division of Wang Yizhe's unit went to drive them away. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed eastward. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Jie telegraphed on the 22nd that from 6:00 PM on the 21st until dawn on the 22nd, a large force of enemy infantry and artillery attacked the Longtangou area on our left wing. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, disregarding their own safety, charging into the enemy's ranks, engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than ten times. However, the enemy's concentrated artillery fire reached more than 6,000 rounds. In the end, with bodies of flesh and blood, they could not withstand the fierce artillery fire. Our attacking forces therefore lost a battalion commander in action, one injured, and over two thousand officers and soldiers were killed or injured, resulting in the Longtangou positions being gained and lost several times. Fierce fighting is still underway. The Nantianmen positions are still extremely solid, and morale is high. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Shixia reports that over two thousand enemy soldiers, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, launched attacks on the left and right wings of our Nantianmen yesterday, hoping to seize the passes of the Great Wall on both sides of Gubeikou. After our army bravely fought back, they were repelled by us, and many were killed by our landmines. Two companies of enemy infantry attacking near Pochengzi on the left wing have been surrounded and eliminated by a certain unit of our army. In the evening, the fighting eased slightly. Until dawn on the 22nd, the enemy increased reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on us. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Over three hundred wounded soldiers, including two battalion commanders and several company and platoon leaders, were transported from the front to Shixia on the afternoon of the 22nd, and then transferred to the rear for treatment.

<p>As Members of the Central Standing Committee, They Cannot Shirk Their Responsibility</p>
<p>Meeting to Suppress Bandits and Resist Japan Is the Fulfillment of the Declaration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, the Su, Zhe, Wan, Ping, Jin, Hu, Han, and twenty-two provincial and municipal special party headquarters telegraphed Hu Hanmin, a member of the Central Committee, who was in Hong Kong, and various members of the Central Committee in the southwest. The original telegram stated: "Hong Kong sends its respects to Mr. Hu Zhantang. Since the Japanese invaders have been invading, they have been relentless. They have already seized the four northeastern provinces, and are now attacking various parts of Guan Nei. Beiping, Tianjin, Chahar, and Suiyuan are in imminent danger. The coastal and river areas are all under threat. Furthermore, the Jiangxi Red bandits have taken the opportunity to counterattack, hindering the national army and aiding the Japanese invaders. They are misleading the military and harming the country, even worse than the Shanghai battle. At this time of internal and external attacks, national ruin is imminent. The path to saving the country lies in both resisting Japan and suppressing bandits. To complete these two arduous tasks, all party comrades must be sincerely united to meet the crisis. It is especially necessary to concentrate the nation's talents and strength to alleviate the national crisis. This is the unanimous call of the party and the nation. As a member of the Central Standing Committee, you have an undeniable responsibility to love and save the country. Can you bear to stay far away in Guangdong and Hong Kong, watching the national crisis without thinking of going to the rescue? Can you bear to see comrades in the Central Committee, who have shared many years of adversity, completely exhausted without concerning yourself with their fate? If the nation and the party perish, how will you deal with yourself? Therefore, we jointly telegraph to earnestly request that you invite the members of the Central Committee from Guangdong and Guangxi to come to Beijing immediately to save the peril. We are extremely urgent." Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters, Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters, Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters, Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters, Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, Suiyuan Provincial Party Headquarters, Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Nanjing Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Hankou Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Tianjin Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Beiping Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Qingdao Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Pinghan Railway Special Party Headquarters, Jinpu Railway Special Party Headquarters, Wuchang Zhuzhou Pingxiang Railway Special Party Headquarters, Beining Railway Special Party Headquarters, Jiaoji Railway Special Party Headquarters, China Seamen's Special Party Headquarters kowtow with respect.</p>
<p>Another telegram: "Guangzhou, Committee Member Chen Bonan, Guilin, Committee Member Li Delin, Committee Member Bai Jiansheng, and to all armed comrades. Since the Japanese invaders have been invading, they have been relentless. They have already seized the four northeastern provinces, and are now attacking various parts of Guan Nei. Beiping, Tianjin, Chahar, and Suiyuan are in imminent danger. The coastal and river areas are already under threat. Furthermore, the Jiangxi Red bandits have taken the opportunity to counterattack, hindering the national army and aiding the Japanese invaders, even worse than the Shanghai battle. At this time of internal and external attacks, national ruin is imminent. Our comrades armed at the front have been sacrificing themselves heroically. The people of the whole country have been contributing their strength and wealth, and all have the same enemy. Now is the time to concentrate the nation's military strength to meet the great disaster, with the morale and popular sentiment being carried out to the highest extent. The comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi should, in the shortest possible time, cooperate with various armies to suppress the communists, so that this military force can be transferred north to provide reinforcements. If they can follow the central government's overall plan and divide their forces to resist Japan, it is also what the whole country urgently desires. Comrade Chief Commander, your duty is to defend the country. Therefore, we earnestly request that you consider the survival of the nation and the people, quickly comply with the central government's orders, fulfill your repeated declarations, carry out the expedition, eliminate the Jiangxi bandits, meet in the north, deceive the Japanese pirates, return our rivers and mountains, and save the crisis. This is the only chance. This telegram is sent with utmost urgency." (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Zhang Qun and Others Suggest Indirect Resistance to Japan by the Sichuan Army <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun, Xiong Jinfan, and other members of the fundraising committee of the Sichuan Supporting the Anti-Japanese Army suggested to the central government that the entire Sichuan army, numbering about 400,000, are all loyal and brave soldiers, but their loyalty originates with individuals, and their courage is directed inward, resulting in repeated sacrifices, which is extremely regrettable. Now that a strong neighbor is invading and the communist disaster is spreading, the generals are temporarily at peace with each other, perhaps due to a glimmer of conscience. The central government should capitalize on this, so that those who were loyal to individuals become loyal to the country, and those who were brave internally become brave externally. In fact, if the Sichuan army is to be sent to the front to directly participate in the war, it cannot be done quickly. The only way is for the Sichuan army to indirectly resist Japan, by having the central government order the troops currently in Shaanxi and Hubei provinces to go north to resist Japan, and let the Sichuan army garrison Shaanxi and Hubei provinces, so that the major plans of internal pacification and external resistance can be carried out simultaneously.

<p>Decided by the Constitutional Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There are different views on the subordination of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, with different reasons. Luo Wengan advocated subordination to the Executive Yuan, while Chen Zhaoying and others advocated subordination to the Judicial Yuan. Furthermore, Gu Zhutong requested the Executive Yuan that matters of judicial administration be handled by orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and that the judicial power of adjudication should be subordinate to the provincial governments. All of these were submitted by the Executive Yuan to the central government for discussion. At a meeting last week, the Central Political Council decided to hand it over to the Constitutional Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan for review and decision. The Constitutional Drafting Committee has now decided that it should be subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and will be incorporated into the political system in the constitution. As for whether the judicial power of adjudication of judicial organs should be subordinate to the provincial governments, or still subordinate to the Supreme Court of the Judicial Yuan, it will be discussed by the Legislative Council, and then decided by the Central Political Council.

<p>(Nanjing) Tea merchants from the entire Anhui province petitioned the Executive Yuan, stating that the Anhui Provincial Government has cleverly established various names to collect disguised tea taxes, causing the Anhui tea industry to frequently go bankrupt. They requested the Executive Yuan to order the provincial government to immediately stop collecting the tax. The Ministry of Finance is concerned that the Anhui provincial tea merchants have filed a complaint alleging that the Anhui Provincial Government has illegally collected tea taxes. The Executive Yuan has already transferred the case to the Ministry for thorough investigation. The province has been repeatedly hit by bandit disasters in recent years, and commerce has declined. If taxes are recklessly increased, the future of commerce will be greatly affected. In order to rescue commerce and clarify the truth, it is planned to send personnel to Anhui for a thorough investigation, and then petition the Executive Yuan to approve the abolition of the tax.

<h3 id="e29">The United States Abandons the Gold Standard (Part 1) 晦 <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Deepening of Economic Panic</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the financial panic, the United States has temporarily banned cash exports in order to alleviate the financial panic and prevent its continued expansion. However, it has not indicated that it will abandon the gold standard or adopt an inflation policy. This is because American financial capitalists, for their own interests, do not yet see the need to abolish the gold standard at this time. Moreover, they find it advantageous to maintain the status quo when recovering debts. However, the global economic panic is deepening day by day. Where will it ultimately lead? Although optimists have various predictions of an imminent recovery, the facts since last year have proven them to be lacking in certainty.</p>
<p>The deepening of the industrial panic in the United States now serves as the biggest prerequisite for abandoning the gold standard. If an inflation policy cannot be implemented, then general industry will fall into an unmanageable state. In the industrial sector, an inflation policy is considered a natural and necessary course of action. However, the hopes of the financial sector are quite the opposite, or at least they believe that the time is not yet ripe and that the situation should be allowed to develop further before a decision is made. However, the modern economic structure is fundamentally organized by industrial relations, with financial relations being merely the top layer of the structure. Therefore, it is unreasonable and contrary to the facts to dismiss the demands of the industrial sector and claim that there is no need to abandon the gold standard simply based on the interests of the financial sector. In highly developed capitalist countries, the modern economic organization is an organic organization with both financial and industrial relations, which are so interconnected that they are inseparable. The core of the modern economic organization, the foundational force, is the industrial relations, not the financial relations.</p>
<p>How severe is the industrial panic in the United States? There is no need to elaborate. To use only the price index (with 1914 as the base year), it fell to 72.0 in February of this year. Using the production index (with 1923-25 as the base year), it fell to 59.9. Although these are abstract numerical displays of the industrial panic, in terms of the general living conditions of the people, except for a very small number, everyone is crying out in pain and has no way out. The unemployed and starving people are everywhere. After the financial panic broke out in March of this year, the failures of large enterprises occurred one after another, which is the worst phenomenon in the past three and a half years. If this industrial panic cannot be overcome in the shortest possible time, the failures of enterprises will become more apparent in the future, and the financial panic will inevitably be brewing in secret. If an opportunity arises, it will inevitably erupt and become unmanageable. This is the greatest threat to the gold standard, and it is also a huge bomb that will lead to the destruction of capitalism. Therefore, the US authorities must urgently seek to save the situation. As a result, the US President openly proposed to reinstate the order prohibiting gold exports, and at the same time effectively abandoned the gold standard. On the other hand, an inflation policy was implemented. The United States hopes to achieve the following results with this move: First, after the value of the currency is devalued, prices can be raised. Second, after the inflation policy is implemented, the industrial sector will have the opportunity to revive. Third, the amount of pure gold contained in the US dollar will be reduced, and foreign trade can be expanded. Fourth, war debts may be easier to recover. Fifth, break through tariff barriers and open up trade markets.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Japanese Army Ministry Announces Japanese Troops Prepare to Withdraw to the Great Wall <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Is This Merely a Delaying Tactic?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry announced today that since April 10th, fighting south of the Great Wall has occurred to stop the oppression of Chinese troops on the border of Jehol and to drive them beyond the range of the Great Wall's artillery. Now that this has been accomplished, an order to cease fire has been issued, and there will be no further pursuit. The Army Ministry spokesman said that as soon as it is certain that the Chinese troops no longer intend to attack, the Japanese army intends to withdraw to the Great Wall. However, if the Chinese troops attempt to enter the neutral zone created by the Japanese withdrawal, Japanese aircraft will bomb them from the sky. The Chinese troops in eastern Luan have now been completely driven out, and within an area averaging about ten miles deep west of the Luan River below the Great Wall, up to Miyun, there are no Chinese troops. Today's aerial bombardment caused the Chinese troops concentrated in Miyun, who were planning to attack Gubeikou, to scatter. The spokesman also mentioned that some of the Japanese troops participating in the Jehol and North China battles will return to their original defense positions in northern Manchuria. As for Japan encouraging Ding Qiang to establish a government in eastern Luan that supports (Manchukuo), this is not the case. Japan does not want to help (Manchukuo) expand its territory beyond the Great Wall. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Army Ministry issued optimistic statements about the end of the fighting south of the Great Wall, Tokyo newspapers tonight still received news from the front, claiming that there was fierce fighting at Gubeikou, with five divisions of Chinese troops participating in a counterattack, which was repelled by the Japanese army.

<p>(London) Today's editorial in The Times discussed the recent developments in the Far East, stating that Japan's self-imposed task of establishing order in Manchuria has led it further and further afield. The Japanese undoubtedly know that they are gradually sinking into a deep abyss and cannot permanently threaten the unfriendly population from Siberia to Beiping. If China agrees to recognize (Manchukuo), it is thought that Japan will be willing to peacefully resolve the situation with China. The Times concluded by saying that if the two major powers, China and Japan, do not want to have a permanent armed conflict, then the only way is to establish a compromise between China and Japan.

<p>(London) British officials today issued statements that contradict previous views, claiming that Japan's re-establishment of Lushun as a naval base does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty or other treaties, so there is no need to consult the signatory countries. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles say that foreign reports criticizing Japan for re-establishing a naval port in Lushun are largely erroneous, and that Japan's abandonment of the Lushunkou naval port a few years ago was purely for economic reasons and has nothing to do with the Washington Conference Nine-Power Treaty.

<h3 id="e36">The Issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway is in Dispute <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Li Shaogeng Refutes Soviet Russia's Reply</p>
<p>The Paris Times Propagandizes for the Japanese</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, (Manchukuo) officials said that Soviet Russia's reply to (Manchukuo)'s request for the return of Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles that had entered Russian territory was tantamount to an insult. The attitudes of both sides towards the dispute remain strong, and neither side shows any sign of compromise. The Soviet government's reply was in response to a letter from Li Shaogeng, the superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway, to Soviet Russian chief representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Kushniakov, on April 12th. Li's letter requested that Soviet Russia return all vehicles within one month, but Soviet Russia's reply stated that (the vehicles of the Chinese Eastern Railway not only belong to Soviet Russia, but the Chinese Eastern Railway has used freight cars in the past two years, which is actually due to Soviet Russia's kindness. It is now hoped that (Manchukuo) will no longer hinder the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, in response to the protest to the Soviet Russian side, Li Shaogeng, the superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway, delivered a rebuttal on the 20th to the Soviet Russian Consul-General, urging the Soviet Russian side to reflect. The rebuttal listed: 1. To restore direct transport on the Manchouli-Zabaikalsk railway, a new agreement must be made, which cannot be done solely according to the Soviet Russian side's wishes. (Manchukuo) is willing to negotiate on this. 2. The prerequisite for the start of negotiations is the return of the freight cars that were taken away. (Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times today published an editorial stating that the dispute between Russia and Japan over the Chinese Eastern Railway is unlikely to continue to develop, as Moscow, which is short of funds, will probably sell the railway's interests for 100 million yuan or the amount offered by Japan, in order to save face. It also stated that the Japanese army does not want to advance to Tianjin and Beiping now, as this move would only cause serious international disputes. If China relies on the intervention of the great powers or the League of Nations, it is truly ignorant. The only wise strategy now is to negotiate directly with Japan. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

Now that it has suddenly fallen, exporters will suffer great losses, and since the silver price of the standard is high, the cost of goods sold will also increase. The gold and silver earned from sales are in an inverse proportion.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - Ishii, the Japanese representative who went to Washington to participate in the economic discussions, said to Japanese reporters today, I am convinced that although the Ishii-Lansing Agreement was repealed at the Washington Conference, its main principle, that is, the United States' recognition of Japan's prominent position in the Far East, is still understood by most of American public opinion. I do not know whether the Manchurian question will be mentioned in this Washington discussion, but I can say without a doubt that the Manchurian question has become a thing of the past. The key point for the world today is the unified cooperation between Japan (Manchukuo) and China in order to seek a way out of the current economic and social difficulties in the Far East. For the sake of maintaining peace in the Far East and world peace in general, this kind of cooperation is really necessary. The sooner China understands this point, the more beneficial it will be to the three countries, but if China does not understand it sooner, the Republic of China will inevitably fall into an irreparable predicament.

<p>Refuses to Cancel War Debts, Focuses on Tax Rates</p>

<p>Havas, New York, 21st – British Prime Minister MacDonald, accompanied by his daughter and members of the British delegation, arrived in New York at 10:30 this morning aboard the (Berengaria). British Ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Lindsay, embassy staff, representatives from the State Department, and journalists boarded the ship to welcome them. MacDonald told the press that he came with a spirit of amity and cooperation, just as he did when he visited President Hoover in 1929. He added that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard would not affect his future talks with President Roosevelt, or at least that was his understanding based on the limited information he had. MacDonald then boarded a steamboat with Lindsay and others to cross the Hudson River. He did not disembark in New York, but went directly to Washington D.C. via a special train from Jersey City. During the journey, Ambassador Lindsay explained to MacDonald the situation created by the United States' abandonment of the gold standard. Upon arriving in Washington, MacDonald will immediately go to the White House, where President Roosevelt will host a banquet to welcome him. The first political discussion between Roosevelt and MacDonald will take place after the banquet. President Roosevelt had a slight cold a few days ago, but has fully recovered. He will accompany MacDonald on a cruise up the Potomac River on Sunday, where the two can hold secret talks. This is just like when Hoover invited MacDonald to the Rapidan camp for secret talks during MacDonald's previous visit to the United States. The public hopes that the talks will be filled with an atmosphere of intimacy and that both sides can understand each other.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – British Prime Minister MacDonald and his entourage arrived in the US capital tonight. They studied the recent developments in the United States during the train journey. Secretary of State Hull greeted them at the station and then escorted the guests to the White House. President Roosevelt, breaking precedent, welcomed them at the front porch with his wife and daughter, Mrs. Dahl. The British Prime Minister's address, broadcast from the Berengaria, has created a very good impression on the American people.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 21st – According to well-informed sources, the US government has decided on the attitude to be taken on various issues to be discussed in the upcoming Washington talks: (1) (War debt issue) The US government, in accordance with the Democratic Party platform, has no choice but to firmly reject the cancellation of war debts. However, it will not reject the reduction or temporary suspension of war debt payments. In the government's view, the war debt issue is just one part of the global economic situation. (2) (Currency issue) The US government believes that stabilizing exchange rates is a fundamental condition for revitalizing world trade. Therefore, the United States is prepared to revise tax rates, but other countries should also revise them at the same time. (3) (Silver price issue) The US government is prepared to discuss with various countries methods to raise silver prices, and if all countries adopt bimetallism, the United States is also prepared to consider it. (4) (Disarmament issue) The US government believes that the huge military expenditures borne by various countries are an obstacle to all efforts to restore economic equilibrium. Therefore, it will assist in any initiative to reduce armaments.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Anglo-American Negotiations Begin <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>National, Washington, 21st – British Prime Minister MacDonald and US President Roosevelt quietly began their arduous task of stabilizing the gold dollar and the gold pound and jointly fighting to save the economy from decline tonight in the White House reception room. The financial frenzy that has arisen around the world since the United States abandoned the gold standard was also fully dispelled when MacDonald set foot in the White House, as it is believed that the two countries will not engage in a war of currency inflation. Upon arriving in Washington, MacDonald told reporters that he wanted to discuss the international restoration of the gold standard and war debts with President Roosevelt as part of a comprehensive economic problem, but that he did not particularly focus on the war debt aspect. He also said that it was regrettable that some outside observers had made harsh comments about the United States' abandonment of the gold standard. He wanted to earnestly request the fullest cooperation between Britain and the United States on the current great undertaking. A Paris dispatch also indicated that Herriot was willing to participate in this effort to avoid causing a currency inflation war and to avoid isolating France. Herriot also sent a radio message from the Ile de France, stating that he was willing to do his best to cooperate to facilitate President Roosevelt's arduous work.</p>
<h3 id="e77">US Proposals <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>As for the talks between Roosevelt and MacDonald, it is said that Roosevelt will first propose reducing tariffs, concluding several reciprocal trade agreements between countries, and universally agreeing to special rights for countries to expand trade. Regarding the reduction of tariffs by the United States, Roosevelt will propose that other countries reduce them in the same way as a reward. He will also propose joint action by countries to curb the activities of exchange speculators, who often do not hesitate to depreciate their own or other countries' currencies for personal gain. As for the war debt issue, according to reliable sources, the President will not offer any other suggestions except for the one approved by Congress to allow debtor countries to repay a portion of their debts in silver in the first year. He only wants to listen quietly to Britain's proposals and then immediately consult with congressional leaders. If Congress believes that the financial situation and domestic public opinion allow for modification of war debts, then he will support the modification. In addition, the President will propose that governments of all countries use methods that do not violate the constitution and can be implemented to help raise prices.</p>
<h3 id="e78">British Proposals <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>As for British Prime Minister MacDonald, in addition to proposing the international restoration of the gold standard, he is expected to agree to the general reduction of tariffs and the careful adjustment of tariffs by various countries. It is also heard that MacDonald will insist that if tariffs are generally reduced, the principle of equality must be followed. However, this issue of equality is almost as difficult as the currency issue, because what Britain considers equal, the United States Congress may consider unequal. For example, there are many goods on which Britain levies a tax of 30 percent, while the United States levies 60 percent. However, what MacDonald wants is the real reduction of excessively high tax rates, while taxes levied solely for revenue purposes seem to be secondary. As for war debts, Britain now believes that previous agreements were not based on international equality. Therefore, MacDonald will demand that any new agreement, regardless of who makes it, must be based on equality, and he will describe a final solution that can be implemented once and for all. In resolving the issue, the so-called (prosperity index) should not be used as the basis, nor should the ability to pay be asked, because MacDonald believes that these two items change from time to time in various countries and cannot be used as the basis for resolution. As for financial issues, because of their important relationship with international commerce, it is said that they will be discussed first.</p>

<p>France Expresses Determination Not to Abandon the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Germany Believes Dollar Depreciation is Beneficial to It</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – It is expected that the President's limited currency inflation bill will pass quickly, so that the President will have sufficient tools when negotiating with British Prime Minister and others. Senator Robinson stated today after meeting with the President that appropriate debate in Congress will not be prevented, but if anyone engages in disruption and obstruction, the number of votes Congress can obtain will be sufficient to prevent it. The final passage of the rural relief bill will indeed require a slight delay, but the amendments to this bill must be dealt with quickly, as the United States will engage in economic discussions with foreign governments. Sharpened disputes have now developed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd – French Finance Minister Bonnet told guests today that France will not abandon the gold standard. France's position is very clear. France hopes that various countries will restore the gold standard as soon as possible. The French cabinet has decided that the government should request that a world economic conference be convened as soon as possible. Instructions have already been sent to Herriot, the French representative to the preparatory meeting in Washington, ordering him to submit this proposal as soon as he arrives in Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st – Reuters learned today from responsible sources that France will not abandon the gold standard at present. However, according to the opinion of a certain French economist, if world prices cannot return to French domestic prices, France will be forced to abandon the gold standard due to heavy domestic debt burdens and significant export losses. He predicts that the current rate of imports of US goods will be immediately readjusted.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 21st – A communique was issued here today, expressing the opinion that Germany should be allowed to repay its dollar loans in paper dollars, saying that Germany should not disregard the gold clauses in its loan agreements. Because the United States can legally reduce the gold value of its own obligations while still maintaining the gold value of its claims, which is unfair.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 21st – Financial circles here have issued a semi-official announcement, giving a detailed analysis of the current state of the international monetary system after the dollar's decline. The conclusion is that the current drop in the price of the dollar is not due to international trade or the movement of assets. This move is actually a strategy with far-reaching intentions by the US authorities. The announcement also said that the events in the United States may have an adverse impact on Germany's export industry. Because after the dollar falls, export goods can be sold at lower prices or aggressive dumping policies can be implemented. The previous example is the British abandonment of the gold standard, which is very obvious. However, Germany can also make a small profit, such as reducing external debts due to the lower price of gold dollars. As for Germany's response to the actions of the United States, there is absolutely no intention to imitate it. The German government will be able to adhere to the principles announced by the president of the national bank a few days ago, that the German people who deposit their savings in banks can rest easy. Because the national bank is being cautious everywhere and is trying to maintain the interests of depositors without endangering their deposits.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 21st – The Senate Banking Committee approved Roosevelt's currency inflation draft. Today, the committee began reviewing the bill with Treasury Secretary Woodin and Budget Director Douglas, barring outsiders from attending.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – The Senate Banking Committee today passed an amendment to the rural relief bill, containing the President's monetary plan. This amendment has now been sent to the House of Representatives for review. Some members of the committee suggested deleting the clause reducing the gold content of coins, but the votes were tied at ten for and ten against, so the motion failed to pass. However, a clause was passed allowing the Federal Reserve to instruct the reserve banks to increase or decrease the reserve requirements for their deposits as needed to curb inflation. The President personally indicated that the amendment to the rural relief bill should be enacted as soon as possible and that debate must be brief to avoid obstruction by the Republicans.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – The Republicans today in the Senate criticized the authorities' plan. Opposition leader Reed claimed that the government's plan would inflate the currency by 200 billion yuan. The Federal Reserve could issue 30 billion yuan of currency in the open market, could print 30 billion yuan of paper money, could reduce the gold content of coins and increase the existing currency by 60 billion yuan, and could use the remaining gold certificates of 80 billion yuan. The Democrats replied that President Roosevelt had said earlier that the currency inflation plan was only to give the President the power to act judiciously. This kind of power may not be used if it is not needed.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd – President Roosevelt and Senators King of Utah and Wheeler of Montana consulted on the silver issue for a long time. The US government seems prepared to issue silver coins, as the movement in Congress to use silver as currency is gaining momentum. The so-called (silver senators) (that is, senators from silver-producing states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming) are all advocating the use of silver as currency and are advocating that the President issue 60 billion yuan of exchange notes based on full-power laws, that is, as silver exchange notes, which are fully guaranteed by silver. It is also said that the existing silver in the United States is only enough to guarantee 10 billion yuan of exchange notes, and that issuing 60 billion yuan of exchange notes would not only allow the silver mines that are currently closed to reopen, but the Treasury Department would also have to purchase silver from foreign countries. If so, countries such as Mexico and China that store silver can re-export silver. As silver prices rise, the price of their domestic currencies will also increase. It is found that Mexico and China are the important customers of the United States. They currently lack the ability to purchase American goods. If silver prices are raised, these countries can restore their prosperity. Therefore, raising silver prices has a major task in relieving the economic decline of the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – The silver clause in the currency inflation bill drafted by Senators King and Wheeler stipulates that the President has the right to determine the gold-silver ratio with silver as currency. In addition, it also stipulates the minting of gold and silver coins, but this plan is purely permissive in nature, not compulsory.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – After President Roosevelt met with Senators King and Wheeler for a long time, it seems that a silver clause will be added to the authorities' currency inflation bill today. Senators King and Wheeler told people when they left the White House that the President had agreed to a silver clause, but the two senators were unwilling to announce the content of this clause. It is said that since the President has the right to stipulate the gold content in currency, he should also have the right to stipulate the silver content in currency, so that the ratio between gold and silver can be determined. Senators King and Wheeler have now returned to their congressional offices to draft their proposals.</p>

<p>National, Washington, 21st – When the British Prime Minister delivered his talk in Washington, it was learned from reliable sources that President Roosevelt's main wish at this time was only to increase the lending of the Federal Reserve Banks by 30 billion yuan. He will proceed with this matter as the first thing after Congress authorizes it. It is also heard that the President hopes that the situation created after the re-imposition of the gold ban can achieve the effect of self-regulating finance, and there will be no need to use the more radical provisions in the currency inflation bill. According to the report of the Ministry of Finance, although the transactions of various industries have increased sharply in recent days, the banks can still cope with it easily, and there is no great shortage of currency.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd – President Roosevelt declared that the amendment to the rural relief bill proposed by Senator Thomas is indispensable in the economic recovery process. He hopes that Congress will pass it immediately, so that dictatorial power does not have to be used. The President also said that after the passage of this bill, the overproduction of agriculture can be controlled. If not, the benefits of the increase in agricultural product prices may be eliminated due to overproduction. As for the imbalance between the prices of agricultural products and industrial products, this bill cannot remedy it.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Futile Efforts to Balance Currency Prices in Anglo-American Negotiations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd – It is learned that in a recent conversation between British Ambassador to the US, Lindsay, and US Secretary of State Hull, Hull firmly requested that the British government stabilize the pound sterling at a price of about $4.20 per pound. Lindsay replied that if the difference between the pound sterling and the US dollar were reduced, it would have an adverse impact on British commerce. Britain must acknowledge the cancellation of war debts before it can satisfy the United States on this point. Hull then said that the situation in the United States did not allow for the cancellation of war debts. In addition, Davis, the US representative to the disarmament conference in London, also made this kind of negotiation with the British Foreign Office. After these two negotiations, Roosevelt believed that it was futile to try to get the British government to stabilize the pound sterling and reduce its difference with the US dollar. He then decided to abandon the gold standard, hoping to create a situation to force countries to seek practical ways to restore currency balance. In this way, the depreciation of various currencies related to gold can be expected, and the stability of the world's general economy can be realized.</p>

<p>There is a new development in financial matters today. Several senators who have always stubbornly opposed modifying war debts are willing to consider it. Most senators generally agree to the provision allowing debtor countries to return silver, which is the first real indication of this trend. Senator Adams, who is known for opposing the modification of war debts, also stated today that he will offer an amendment to relax the amount of silver returned by debtor countries.

<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd – The American Federation of Labor notified workers to fight together to demand increased wages. The abandonment of the gold standard and the implementation of currency inflation will inevitably raise prices, and increased wages are necessary to cope with it.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Reason Gradually Becomes Clear, Market Speculative Frenzy Slightly Declines <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>National, Washington, 21st – Today, the American people heard that the President hoped that it would not be necessary to use the more radical provisions in the currency inflation bill, and Prime Minister MacDonald arrived in New York. Former Treasury Secretary Mills suddenly arrived in Washington to lead the Republican Party to fight the currency inflation faction with all its strength, so as to avoid excessive actions in the monetary system. Because of these various influences, reason gradually became clear, and the speculative frenzy began to decline. Market prices also fell back. The fall in silver prices was almost as fierce as yesterday's soaring. The general impression is that the market has already been over-sold, so many people stopped doing new business.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 21st – The Republican Party's fight against currency inflation did not shock the government and the Democratic Party. Because even the Republican leaders believed that the bill would definitely pass. They knew that their opposition might not be effective, but they wanted the people to know the advantages and disadvantages of the various clauses of the bill. Former Treasury Secretary Mills' sudden arrival in Washington was completely unexpected. After he arrived in Washington, he immediately discussed everything with the key members of the House minority party and met with Senate Minority Leader Reed and House Minority Leader Snell for a long time. Afterwards, the party declared that it would not take organized obstructive action on the currency inflation bill, but would only insist on giving the minority party the opportunity to speak freely before the bill was put to a vote. It also admitted that the bill might be extended until after Prime Minister MacDonald left the United States before it was passed. However, the bill has been passed by the Finance Committee in the Senate today and sent out a favorable report. The government does not seem anxious about the bill being delayed. The government's attitude is also sufficient to verify that the US President does not want to use this bill as a negotiating weapon. He only wants to undertake the task of building a foundation for a successful meeting, which he has to undertake due to the situation.</p>

<p>National Power Party Leader Issues Declaration</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st – Signs of unrest have arisen within Hitler's cabinet again. Last night, Hugenberg, the leader of the National Power Party and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, issued a declaration in the party's newspapers, stating that in order to implement the (full-power) law, it must be on the condition that the central government, which is organized according to the current situation, continues to exist. Before this startling declaration was issued, Hugenberg had consulted with President Hindenburg, and their relationship became increasingly important. The German political atmosphere became heated due to Hugenberg's declaration. The National Power Party is deeply afraid that after the National Socialist Party conducts a revolution with nationalism, it will be followed by a revolution of socialism. As for Hitler, he is also afraid that the cabinet conflict will have serious effects. In addition, the German army completely obeys Hindenburg and is not affected by National Socialism. Therefore, Hitler wants to avoid the cabinet conflict by roundabout means and does not want Hindenburg to be involved.</p>

<h3 id="e92">London Russian Trade Representative Recalled, Hope for Release of British Technicians Suddenly Appears <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 22nd – In response to the recent British government's ban on Russian imports, the Soviet government has taken swift action. Today, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Rozengolts, issued an order regarding Anglo-Soviet trade, including the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) Prohibiting Soviet foreign trade organizations from issuing any orders to Britain and purchasing any goods.</p>
<p>(2) Prohibiting Soviet shipping organizations from hiring any British ships. (3) Establishing measures to restrict British goods passing through Soviet territory. (4) Ordering Soviet transportation and transshipment organizations to minimize the use of British ports.</p>
<p>The above measures are implemented in accordance with the decree passed by the Soviet Council of People's Commissars on October 20, 1930.  They will remain in effect until Britain cancels the ban on Russian imports.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 22nd – Soviet Foreign Trade Commissar Rozengolts has ordered the recall of the Soviet trade representative in London, Ozersky, and his two assistants. Ozersky and others will depart from London on April 24th and return directly to Moscow.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 21st – The Soviet Russian trade delegation has issued a formal statement stating that no one is authorized to act on behalf of the delegation upon its departure from Britain and return to Russia. Therefore, there will effectively be no large number of new orders during this period. The head of the delegation, Vozhilsky, and his two assistants are scheduled to return to Moscow on Monday to consult with the Soviet Russian Foreign Trade Committee.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 22nd – After Britain's ban on Russian imports, Anglo-Soviet trade will come to a standstill. The Soviet People's Commissariat for Water Transport today issued an order to impose higher taxes on British ships entering the country, to reflect the difference compared to the mutual benefit that existed when the Anglo-Russian trade agreement was in effect.</p>
<p>Moscow, Reuters, 21st – The lawyer of the imprisoned British engineer, Thornton, Browder, has today again petitioned the Central Executive Committee to overturn Thornton's and Macdonald's sentences, or reduce the sentence to deportation.  It is expected that the Central Executive Committee will issue a decision soon.  The current location of the two Britons in prison is not known for sure.  It is generally believed to be in the Lubyanka prison.  Foreigners in Moscow now believe that the two British technicians have hope of leaving Russian territory by the end of next week.</p>
<p>London, National News, 21st – Britain's ban on the sale of Russian goods and the Soviet Union's retaliatory actions have caused speculation here about their impact on the US recognition of Soviet Russia. Although some in the business community believe that the Russian market could greatly contribute to American foreign trade, many believe that the recent arrest of Vickers Company's British engineers by the Soviet Union will make the US more hesitant to resume diplomatic relations. Even the representatives of American businesses stationed in England share this view, saying that if the US restores diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, American businesses may face the same treatment. The general public also believes that, regardless of whether the US recognizes Soviet Russia, if the Soviet Union can obtain credit from the US, some goods will be shifted to purchases from the US. Still others hope that the Soviet Union will realize that when Britain and Russia trade, the benefits to the Russians far outweigh those to the British, and will be able to change its attitude. The benefits gained by both countries in mutual trade can be seen in the following table:</p>
<p>| Year | British Goods to Russia (Pounds) | Russian Goods Sold to Britain (Pounds) | Britain's Intangible Exports to Russia (Pounds) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 1930 | 12,399,000 | 29,800,000 | 8,066,000 |</p>
<p>| 1931 | 15,018,000 | 32,179,000 | 7,000,000 |</p>
<p>| 1932 | 9,500,000 | 19,000,000 | 4,500,000 |</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recent Soviet Union's preparations to punish Germany's National Socialist Party's anti-Soviet policies are also being closely watched by American business representatives here. Several people have a deep impression that the trend of Soviet trade is uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e93">After Our Troops Abandoned East of the Luan River <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the troops in eastern Luan retreated to the banks of the Luan River, the situation on the front line has changed. The Luan River area is crisscrossed by rivers and has a dangerous terrain.  Our large army defended the area, and the enemy could not fly across it. Its importance is no less than the Great Wall.  Therefore, although the war is becoming increasingly tense, the defense is very solid. The Japanese troops who invaded from the Lengkou area this time include the 16th Division, the 8th Division, and parts of the 6th Division, as well as the rebel troops of Li Jichun, Cheng Guorui, etc., totaling no less than 15,000 to 16,000 men, with a considerable momentum. Our troops fought separately and sacrificed greatly. Lulong and Funing were abandoned one after another. As of yesterday (the 17th), our troops had all retreated to the planned new positions. Japanese troops were found between Anshan and Shimen Station last night and contacted our cavalry Wang Division. Our Zhongshan armored train fired at the Japanese troops to provide cover and assistance. Zhugezhuang also had enemy troops arriving at the same time, attempting to destroy the tracks to cut off our army's return route. We received a report and sent troops to drive them away. The fighting between the two sides was fierce and has not stopped until this morning (the 18th).  Cannon fire could be heard rumbling in Luanzhou city, very clearly, and the situation was extremely frightening. In order to threaten our troops, the Japanese army repeatedly sent large numbers of aircraft to bomb our army's positions. Today, Japanese aircraft flew to Luanzhou, Tangshan and other places to drop bombs. At the same time, Japanese aircraft were also found in Shixia Town, Miyun, Shunyi, and Tongzhou, which is very close to Beiping. The situation in North China is becoming more and more dangerous, and the people in the rear cannot help but feel terrified. The information obtained is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Japanese Aircraft Discovered in Tongzhou Dropping Three Bombs in Yanjiao)</p>
<p>(Tongzhou is Close to Beiping, Heavily Populated, and Commerce is Developed, Rejoicing)</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Fengkou and other places, although the artillery fire on the front line has been fierce in recent days, the people in the rear have been peaceful and prosperous, coming and going, singing and dancing, maintaining a peaceful scene. The Tongzhou area was as calm as before, without any signs of alarm. Unexpectedly, the Japanese are ambitious and are advancing by leaps and bounds, and their acts of aggression have no end in sight. At 8:35 this morning, just as the general residents were waking up from a good dream, a buzzing sound suddenly shook their eardrums. An aircraft flew in the sky, like a dragonfly taking off. The fuselage was light gray, and the silver light was dazzling. It circled and did not leave. Soon, two more aircraft continued to arrive. Looking up, they saw the sun emblem painted on the wings of the aircraft. It was clearly a Japanese aircraft.  As a result, the people of the whole city were greatly shocked and rushed to avoid it, and the situation became somewhat chaotic. The Japanese aircraft flew in the sky for a long time, reconnoitering for forty minutes before leaving. Earlier, the Japanese aircraft flew all the way from the Qinhuangdao area and reconnoitred in the territory of Sanhe County for a long time without dropping bombs. It then flew to Yanjiao near Sanhe and Tongzhou and dropped three bombs, causing slight damage. When it arrived at Tongzhou, it did not drop bombs, its intention being to intimidate and disrupt public morale. The flying height was about 3,000 meters. After leaving, it flew to Shunyi and Miyun, spreading leaflets with extremely absurd wording. It was already 9:30 in the morning. They all reconnoitred for a long time before leaving. For a time, the situation in various places became tense. As for Beiping, air defense facilities have been under planning for a long time, so the public morale is stable and there is no significant impact.</p>
<p>(Luan River East and West Banks Suffered Japanese Aircraft Bombing)</p>
<p>(Eight Japanese aircraft flew in formation to the east and west banks of the Luan River at about 8:00 this morning. They dropped more than forty bombs inside and outside the city, some of which were incendiary bombs. The places where they fell were filled with smoke and dust, and the fire was blazing, and the situation was extremely tragic. The people in the city took to the North-Ning Railway on foot, supporting the old and carrying the young, carrying packages, and fleeing west. Only one-tenth or two-tenths remained. The North-Ning eastbound passenger train could reach Luanzhou. Due to the congestion of refugees, the railway bureau could not allocate enough vehicles. It was specially dispatched a train from Tianjin and Tangshan stations to transport refugees. This morning, many Japanese aircraft also arrived in Tangshan to drop bombs and bomb, and many civilian houses were destroyed. The public was extremely terrified. Countless wealthy households fled to the Tianjin Concession or came to Beiping to seek refuge with relatives and friends. On the same day, at 9:30 this morning, eight Japanese aircraft flew to Shixia Town and dropped more than sixty heavy bombs, injuring more than twenty civilians. The number of buildings destroyed was also not small. Other stations on the North-Ning Line, such as Guye and Tuozi Tou, were also bombed by Japanese aircraft, so their purpose was to destroy our railways in an attempt to stop transportation. The poisonous means became more and more obvious, so the indignation of our people became more and more intense. (April 18th))</p>
<h3 id="e94">A Quick Sketch from Beiping to Zhangjiakou by Our Special Correspondent (Guo An) <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Leaving the gray and decaying ancient city of Beiping, taking the dilapidated train of the PingSui Railway, and climbing towards the distant border. Wind and sand are the specialties of northern Mongolia, and the color of dead ashes fills everywhere. The vast yellow wilderness is lightly decorated with the scenery of spring green. To the west of the ancient city, there are ancient buildings with yellow bricks and green tiles, echoing with the low small houses.</p>
<p>The sun in the wind and sand casts a dim light. The carriages are crowded with soldiers and ragged old people, and there are also a few foreigners squeezed inside. In this air filled with different languages, breaths, and races, some are silent, some are yelling. I firmly occupy the only seat I have, constantly using my strength to resist the invading bodies.</p>
<p>After Shahe, we arrived at Changping. The mountains in the northwest stand tall, showing the natural danger of Nankou. Nankou Station is considered a station with more houses on this vast piece of land. The mountains in the southeast still retain the remnants of the fierce attack on Nankou by the Fengzhi-Lu Allied Forces in the 15th year of the Republic of China. I pay attention to this place where blood has been shed, but in the real environment, who dares to think about anything, especially the Japanese flag at the Great Wall Pass.</p>
<p>The train stopped at Nankou Station for half an hour, dropping a heavy locomotive, and at the same time hooking the locomotive to the tail of the train, preparing to pass through this dangerous mountain tunnel in Nankou. I stood on a guard car at the very front of the train, slowly watching the train pass through the tunnel. The train left Nankou a little bit and entered the valley. The steepest ridge of the stone mountain was covered as it crawled through this particularly slow train. The dilapidated walls of Juyongguan stood on the small mountain ridge in undulating sections. I quickly used my camera to take a close-up of the entrance. The train turned in different directions, climbing sometimes high and sometimes low.</p>
<p>I inadvertently discovered that the sleepers under the rails were either rotten or temporarily filled with debris. It was simply not easy to see any slightly newer sleepers. In this time of surrounding mountains and cliffs, I really felt that life in the train was too small. I didn't understand why this was the case. At this time, a worker watching the train was standing behind me. He said very playfully, "Sir, we are used to running and we are not afraid anymore."</p>
<p>"Why don't you replace the sleepers when they are so bad?" "Haha..." he laughed, but he didn't tell me the reason. In this way, I can only feel depressed! The train circled and went deeper and deeper. Looking down at the broken city of Juyongguan on the left, the stone tablet on the forehead of the first mountain tunnel was probably engraved with "Juyongguan Mountain Tunnel". The car entered the darkness for about two minutes, and then saw the light. At this time, the steep stone walls became more ferocious. When we reached the second cave, Yang Wulang's image was engraved on the left mountain wall, which the locals call "Wulang's Shadow". Unfortunately, my lens was too small to leave a trace. This tunnel was also very short. Further forward, it was simply entering the mountains. Soon we arrived at Qinglong Bridge. The bronze statue of Zhan Tianyou, the founder of the Pingsui Road, stood at the station, with a majestic face and a heroic posture, facing the stone wall and backing the mountain bay. I looked at it for a long time and couldn't help but feel respect.</p>
<p>The car stopped briefly and turned to the southwest. The locomotive turned its direction. Because this section was downhill, it was towed instead of pushed. Passing Badaling, the mountain shape became more dangerous. The dark cave lasted for several minutes. After seventy miles of mountain road, we finally passed safely. When we arrived at Kangzhuang, the station was still vast. The city was the rear general hospital, and the platform was covered with slogans. I vaguely remembered two sentences: "Society should be militarized, and the army should be socialized. Our army will not commit the slightest offense, so go and check." After the car passed Kangzhuang, the wind and sand covered the sun, and the desolate situation of northern Mongolia was fully expressed. The mountains in the distance, the sand in the near, the wind in the sky, and the earth underground rolled like tumbling on the vast wilderness. Here, you can't find the gentle spring breeze of the south of the Yangtze River and the intoxicating weather. Only yellow sand and white grass, and a earth-shattering gale sweeping across. When we arrived at Huailai, we saw the ancient city again, surrounded by mountains, and paved with bluestone like before. Mongolian ponies galloped with gray soldiers. Passing Shacheng, the setting sun trembled in the atmosphere of the wind on the west mountain. The scenery along the way was hungry. Xuanhua Prefecture is a large brick city with four sides, and the north also uses mountains as a barrier. Gray is more profound in the setting sun. □□□'s army is stationed in the city. I wandered around the platform for a long time, looking at the distant wilderness fire. In this vast place, plus the enemy's artillery fire and iron hooves, it is leaping forward more and more. What should we do? Arise, soldiers of the south of the Yangtze River! Enemy artillery fire is our club!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Chen Duxiu's Debate Summary (Continued) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing Set for the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>(The Defendants' Arguments)</p>
<p>After Attorneys Zhang, Peng, and Wu finished defending Chen Duxiu, it was 2:15 PM. The presiding judge announced a recess and adjourned the court, resuming the debate in the afternoon. At 4:00 PM, the court session continued, and the audience seats were even more crowded than in the morning. After the court clerk announced the resumption of the session, each defendant was called upon to present their defense, with their attorneys also presenting arguments on their behalf. The arguments of the defendants and the lawyers' defense speeches are summarized below:</p>
<p>(Peng Shuzhi) Peng Daoshu's reasons for opposing the Kuomintang and the National Government were as follows: (1) The National Government has failed to abolish all unequal treaties. Imperialists still control customs, concessions have not been recovered, consular jurisdiction has not been revoked, and imperialist armies rampage at will. Japan has even occupied the four northeastern provinces, and Shanghai has been occupied once. Therefore, imperialism must be overthrown. (2) The warlords in various provinces have engaged in years of internal warfare, causing suffering to the people, bankruptcy in rural areas, and economic decline in cities. Therefore, the warlords must be disarmed. (3) The people lack freedom, and capitalists are unpatriotic. Currently, the donations in various regions are all contributed by ordinary people, while capitalists and landlords do not contribute a penny. Only farmers and workers possess revolutionary spirit. Based on the above facts and reasons, upholding the interests of the people is not treason. If the court upholds the law, it should declare him innocent.</p>
<p>Attorney Zhang Shizhao added in his defense that it was largely the same as his defense for Chen Duxiu, with the following additions: (1) The defendant admitted to being a communist and opposing the National Government, but not with the intention of implementing communism. It was because the National Government could not implement the Three Principles of the People. There is no provision in the law that makes being a communist a crime, so the defendant's crime cannot be established. (2) The defendant's opposition to the Kuomintang did not compare the Three Principles of the People with communism, and the reason for opposing the Kuomintang was that it could not implement the Three Principles of the People. Article 2, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Offenses Against the Republic of China refers to propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People, so it cannot be applied. (3) Furthermore, factually speaking, Peng did not engage in propaganda work. The publications he printed, "Spark" and "Campus Life," were in very small quantities, and the government prohibited their circulation. Only his friends who believed in communism saw them, so they only had ideas and did not develop them. Even if they were developed, it was very limited, far from what is regulated by the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Offenses Against the Republic of China, so it cannot be applied. The reasons stated by the defendant are not based on the standpoint of communism at all, but rather because of his fervent patriotism, and it could even be said that he is concerned about protecting the Kuomintang. It is illegal to impose a sentence without a law, so please declare the defendant innocent.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that the defendant's opposition to the Kuomintang and the National Government did not endanger the Republic of China. If the nation, government, and party are not regarded as a trinity or a duality, then it cannot be said to endanger the Republic of China. Furthermore, the government is progressive and infinitely progressive. The Kuomintang's achievements can be considered very good in some aspects, while unsatisfactory in others. It cannot be said that someone is committing a crime simply because they criticize. As for the part about written propaganda, because it was prohibited by the government, it did not achieve its purpose and can only be regarded as an attempted crime. The Emergency Law for the Punishment of Offenses Against the Republic of China cannot be applied.</p>
<p>Attorney Wu Zhiping argued that the defendant's publications were not circulated, so there was no propaganda. The prosecutor's accusations cannot be applied. Furthermore, studying academics is not prohibited by law, so he should be declared innocent. At this point, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi both stood up to add a statement that Attorney Zhang's defense, based on his personal observations and criticisms presented to the court, were entirely his personal opinions and were not solicited from them, nor did they need to be solicited. Their political views should not be based on Attorney Zhang's defense but should be based on their own documents.</p>
<p>Wang Wu Wang Wu continued to argue that his previous crime had already been judged and was unrelated to this case. He suffered from severe illnesses such as lung, stomach, and foot diseases. When he was released on bail on October 5th, his family had already left Shanghai because they had run out of money, instructing him to return home immediately after his release. Because he was poor and desperate, he had no choice but to meet Xie Shaoshan. Xie Shaoshan agreed to lend him money and take him to his home. He talked to Xie’s wife, who told him to rest and recover. He was arrested shortly thereafter. Xie is not a defendant, which shows that he was acting as a government informant with the intention of framing him. However, he did not take any action. Regarding the Standing Committee matter, elections must have a basis, but there is no basis now, which shows that it is not accurate. The meeting matter is also not true. Witnesses from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said it seemed like a meeting, with each person having a pen and notebook. However, no physical evidence has been presented now. Moreover, only Western detectives were present during the arrest, and no personnel from the Public Security Bureau were present. Now, it is only based on Xie Shaoshan's words, which cannot be considered. Xie wants to become an official, so he does not hesitate to frame others. Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi have both testified that he is not a member of the Standing Committee. He was extremely ill when he came out of prison, so how could he do anything? Therefore, saying that he was holding a meeting is as ridiculous as saying that a sick person won a 10,000-meter race championship.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that the defendant joined the Communist Party in the fourteenth year of the Republic and was arrested in Shanghai by the Garrison Command in the twentieth year of the Republic, sentenced to six years in prison. During the amnesty, the sentence was reduced to four years. He was released on bail on October 5th of last year and was arrested again on the 15th. He had no activities during the ten days of his bail. Factually speaking, prisoners who can obtain bail must have very serious illnesses that prison doctors cannot treat. Since the defendant had a serious illness, how could he engage in political activities? Furthermore, being elected to the Standing Committee is definitely impossible. The defendant went to Xie Shaoshan's house to borrow money, and he was arrested while talking to Xie’s wife, which proves that he did not participate in the meeting. Moreover, the Public Security Bureau said that everyone had a pen and notebook during the meeting, but there are no such items in the case now. Xie Shaoshan once testified that all five members of the Standing Committee were arrested, and no one escaped. Therefore, no one would have destroyed the evidence after the arrest. Why can't the Public Security Bureau provide the evidence? This shows that it cannot be used as a reference. As for the Standing Committee matter, if he was elected before going to prison, then it has already been judged. If it is said that he was elected in prison, then this is definitely impossible. As for saying that he was elected after being released from prison, it has already been stated that he was too ill to participate in political activities, which is even more unreasonable.</p>
<p>Pu Yifan Pu argued that when he was arrested, he was ordered to find Zeng Shengwei, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Li Weihou, who is currently detained in prison. The court only needs to investigate to understand. He has never joined a political party. He is very busy at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has no time to participate in political activities. This can be verified by the attendance book of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. As for the Standing Committee matter, he does not understand it at all. Chen and Peng said that the alternate was Pu Yifang, a Sichuan native, who is completely unrelated to him. To take a step back, if it is said that he is a member of the Communist Party, how could he be called Pu Yifan in the party and also be called Pu Yifan at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company? Furthermore, in terms of propaganda, he edited the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Monthly. The court can check if there are any political texts or propaganda texts. As for the box found in his residence, the box was deposited by his friend Su Shaoqing. The box has his name card on it. When the police arrested him, they asked him for his address, and he frankly told them. If he had reactionary documents, how could he have given them his address? Moreover, the police did not handle the search of the box in accordance with the law, which is even more inappropriate. After he was arrested, the personal mental and material losses are needless to say, and his elderly mother has gone blind from crying because of this. His wife and children have nothing to eat. Please declare him innocent.</p>
<p>Attorney Liu Zuwang argued: (1) There must be proof of the meeting. Lu Wenhu of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said that when they were arrested, they looked like they were holding a meeting. Such uncertain and speculative statements cannot be used as evidence. Moreover, there are no pens or notebooks, which is even more baseless. (2) There is also no proof of the alternate Standing Committee matter. It cannot be used as evidence based solely on Xie Shaoshan's words. The defendant works for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is a government agency. How could it accommodate a communist Standing Committee member? Pu Yifan and Pu Yifang sound the same, which must be a misrepresentation. (3) As for the books, if the defendant were guilty, he would not have given his address. Moreover, when the search was conducted, Chen Julai and Wang Xiaochun were waiting for the defendant to return home. Chen was released at the time because he was not involved, and Wang was also released later. As for the box, it was deposited by Su Shaoqing, and there are Su's personal letters and name cards in the box, which shows that it is not the defendant's. Even if, to take a step back, it were the defendant's, all reactionary books cannot be considered crimes according to Interpretation No. 502 of the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, please declare the defendant innocent.</p>
<p>Wang Ziping Wang argued that after being expelled, he did not join the Trotskyists. He printed "Spark" because he could not make a living, and he started printing from the eighth issue. If he were a Trotskyist, he should have started printing from the first issue. He had been unemployed for a long time and had repeatedly applied for jobs, but he was not hired due to the large number of applicants. He had no choice but to go into printing. Moreover, the printing work was not important. Xie Shaoshan brought it every time, and he took it away after printing. He was only solving his livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that the defendant was engaged in printing solely due to the pressure of making a living. Although the defendant had once joined the Communist Party, he cannot be regarded as an accomplice in a crime. In terms of the subjective aspect, there should be contact with the principal offender. In terms of the objective aspect, the result should be examined. The defendant is not related to Chen Duxiu and others and only copied for them when hired. Furthermore, propaganda relies on words. If Xie Shaoshan does not bring the manuscript, he cannot print it. Therefore, he cannot be considered an accomplice and should be found not guilty.</p>
<p>Attorney Jiang Haoshi made a joint statement on behalf of all defendants: (1) Xie Shaoshan's confession in the police station cannot be adopted as evidence. Xie is an important figure in the Communist Party, but he is not facing charges himself. He made random confessions in order to avoid charges, so it cannot be adopted. (2) There is no evidence of any kind. The prosecutor's accusation is based entirely on speculation and cannot be adopted. As for Wang Ziping, although he once joined the Communist Party, the law does not apply retroactively. He did not join the Trotskyists after being expelled. He engaged in printing solely for the sake of bread. The government and society should be responsible for youth unemployment. The defendant is not responsible for the crime.</p>
<p>He Afang He argued that Xie Shaoshan told him to print, and he only printed one issue. He was arrested before it was finished. Printing is not a crime because someone writes the articles, someone edits them, and someone distributes them after printing. They should be responsible. For example, making a handgun, the handgun can kill people, but it cannot be said that the maker of the handgun is committing a crime. He went to print entirely for the sake of twenty yuan a month, and it did not conflict with his original occupation as a coppersmith.</p>
<p>Attorney Wu Zhiping argued that the defendant is not responsible. He has already explained that he only printed once and was arrested before it was finished. The Emergency Law for the Punishment of Offenses Against the Republic of China does not have any provisions for this situation. According to Article 30, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, he is only guilty of an attempted crime and should not be punished.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that although the defendant was engaged in printing, he cannot be immediately considered to have joined the Trotskyists because there is no evidence and it is only based on imagination, which cannot be used as evidence.</p>
<p>Wang Zhaoqun Wang argued: (1) Xie Shaoshan confessed that his home was a communist organization. He and I were arrested at the same time. According to the law, he should be a defendant along with us. He has other purposes, so he intentionally harmed people. Although I live in Xie's house, there is no other evidence to say that I am a communist organization. (2) There is no evidence of any kind, so it cannot constitute a crime. If the court protects the law, it should declare him innocent.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that the prosecutor said that Xie's home was a communist organization, and if the defendant had no relationship, he would not be allowed to live in it. This is an inaccurate conclusion based on an inaccurate premise.</p>
<p>Attorney Jiang Haoshi argued that Lu Wenhu of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said that the defendant was standing at the window when they were arrested, which shows that he did not participate in the meeting. Moreover, the Western detective Gode never said anything about a meeting, which shows that Lu Wenhu's words are unreliable.</p>
<p>Guo Jinghao Guo argued that if he were a communist, why would there be no evidence found in his home? Furthermore, why wasn't the school registration form presented at the Second Branch of the Shanghai Higher Court, the Public Security Bureau, and the Jiangsu Higher Court? It was only presented now, which shows that it was fabricated. The form says that he joined the party in Changsha in 1925. At that time, he was still studying in elementary school in his hometown and had never been to Changsha. The form also says that he joined the Trotskyists in Shanghai in the nineteenth year of the Republic. It should be known that he only arrived in Shanghai at the end of the nineteenth year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Attorney Wu Zhiping argued that the defendant is Peng Shuzhi's younger brother. It cannot be said that the younger brother is also a communist simply because the older brother is a communist. There must be direct evidence of a crime. Furthermore, the origin of the registration form cannot be explained even by the staff of the Public Security Bureau, which shows that it is not a legitimate basis.</p>
<p>Attorney Peng Wangye argued that the Public Security Bureau, because there was no evidence after the defendant was arrested, fabricated the registration form to frame the defendant for fear that he would demand compensation.</p>
<p>Attorney Jiang Haoshi argued that the court should pay attention to the fact that there is no other evidence of the defendant's crime. There is only a registration form with no origin.</p>
<p>Liang Youguang Liang argued that he is not a communist at all, and the court also has no evidence. Please declare him innocent immediately.</p>
<p>Attorney Jiang Haoshi argued that the defendant came to Shanghai to find his younger brother. It is not surprising that he escaped from the window when he was arrested. There are many robbery cases and kidnappers in Shanghai. Seeing many people with guns entering in the middle of the night, anyone who would not want to escape in this situation, I say he must not be human. Furthermore, Xie Shaoshan confessed that he was a Guangxi inspector, which is also baseless. If saying that someone came from Guangxi means that they are a Guangxi inspector, then someone who went from Nanjing to Shanghai would be a Nanjing inspector.</p>
<p>When Wang Jiantang Wang argued, he stuttered and could not argue. Only his explanation of the box was heard. In conclusion, he said, "Please, judges, let me go home," causing laughter throughout the courtroom.</p>
<p>Attorney Jiang Haoshi argued that this kind of person is neither qualified for research nor qualified for work. What would the Communist Party want with this kind of person? If the small piece of paper that was found has the character "Chen" on it, it is said to be Chen Duxiu, which is too illogical. Perhaps the police could not catch Wang Boping, so they caught a Wang Jiantang to shirk their responsibility.</p>

<p>At this point, it was 6:35 PM. All defendants and defense attorneys had completed their arguments. The presiding judge asked each defendant again if they had anything else to say. Except for Wang Jiantang, who stuttered, saying, "Let me go home," the rest had nothing to say. The presiding judge then declared the end of the debate, and the sentencing was set for the afternoon of the 26th of this month (Central News Agency).</p>

<h3 id="e104">Reduction of Working Hours Implemented by Chinese-Owned Cotton Mills in the City Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Continued Deliberating on Relief Measures Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Cotton Mill Association Designated Representatives to Petition in the Capital</p>
<p>All Other Cities Besides Tianjin Have Already Implemented the Measures</p>
<p>After the National Chinese Cotton Mill Association resolved on measures to reduce working hours, all Chinese-owned cotton mills in the city, including Hengfeng and Shenxin, suspended operations yesterday. The municipal government and other agencies reconvened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss relief measures. Details are recorded below: (All Factories Suspended Operations) The Cotton Mill Association's resolution to reduce working hours was implemented yesterday, with all day and night shifts suspended every Saturday and Sunday, or a 23% reduction in working hours. As for the city's Chinese-owned cotton mills, totaling 28, including Hengfeng, except for the three mills including Yongyu that were already shut down, and Jingwei, which is a waste cotton mill and therefore operates as usual, the remaining mills including Shenxin have all decided to suspend operations on Saturday and Sunday day and night shifts every week. Yesterday was Saturday, and all factories were completely shut down. Notices from the Cotton Mill Association were posted at the gates of all factories, stating that work would resume on Monday.</p>
<p>(Inspection of Various Factories) The General Meeting of the Cotton Mill Association, for the matter of reducing working hours, appointed the city's supervisory committee members Huang Shoumin, Li Shengbo, and Xue Chunsheng, three individuals to specifically oversee the reduction of working hours in various factories. Yesterday was the first Saturday of the reduction in working hours. At 7:00 a.m., supervisory committee member Xue Chunsheng and two others went by car to inspect various Chinese-owned cotton mills to see if any were violating the resolution. They returned around 1:00 p.m., and it was found that all factories were uniformly complying, the workers were scattered at home, and the order was very good.</p>
<p>(Continued Deliberation by the Municipal Government) At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the municipal government reconvened both labor and management representatives, as well as figures from the banking community, in the conference room on the third floor of the municipal government, to continue discussing relief measures. Those present included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director Liu Yinbo of the Ministry of Industry, Wu Zhongheng representing the Central Party Headquarters, Jiang Huaisu representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Hengru, Wang Ze, Qin Hongji of the Social Affairs Bureau, Nie Lusheng, Zhang Zemin, Guo Shun representing the Chinese cotton mills, Lu Jingshi representing the labor community, and Chen Jianan, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Xinliu, Lin Kanghou, and Qin Xieqing representing the banking community. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 12:00 noon. According to Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, who spoke to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency after the meeting, the meeting concluded that the disastrous decline of the cotton mill industry was a fundamental problem of emerging industry, and that reducing working hours was merely a stopgap measure. In order to seek fundamental relief, it was decided that representatives should be dispatched from the cotton mill industry to the capital to discuss relief measures with the relevant financial and industrial departments, and to provide subsidies or reduce burdens within a possible range.</p>
<p>(Conditions in Various Ports) This reduction in working hours was decided by the General Meeting of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, which convened representatives from all factories in Tianjin, Hankou, Wuxi, and Shanghai. Therefore, this reduction in working hours concerns all Chinese-owned cotton mills nationwide, not limited to Shanghai alone. Factories in Wuxi, Hankou, and other inland areas also uniformly implemented the resolution yesterday morning. In Wuxi, the method of reducing working hours by 23% was mostly used. However, the Tianjin area, due to the tense war situation, has reported to Shanghai by telegram, fearing that it would affect public order, and was unable to implement the measure as scheduled yesterday. It has been agreed that the measure will be implemented before May 21, to await a slight easing of the situation. Currently, factories are reducing working hours and stopping spindles in tandem, with 23% as the standard.</p>
<p>(Number of Working Hour Reductions) According to a survey report from the National Chinese Cotton Mill Association, the total number of working hour reductions is as follows: there are a total of 82 Chinese-owned cotton mills nationwide, of which 60 are members of the association. In Shanghai, there are 8 mills in total, of which 26 are members of the association, with 1,117,000 yarn spindles and 7,800 looms. Outside of Shanghai, there are 54 mills, of which 34 are members of the association, with 1,134,000 yarn spindles and 11,100 looms. In total, the reduction in working hours involves 2,250,000 yarn spindles and 19,000 looms.</p>
<p>(Record Filing for Working Hour Reductions) After resolving to reduce working hours, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association immediately submitted a report to the central government for record filing, stating briefly: "Since 1928, the world's economic situation has been declining, and all countries are suffering from overproduction, using the method of dumping to expand overseas markets. Our country has the lightest tariffs, and has become the end of the dumping chain. Since the massive floods of the 20th year of the Republic, followed by the Japanese invasion of Jehol and Shanghai, the rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy, financial resources have been tightening daily, purchasing power has been weak, and demand has been greatly reduced. Japanese factories in China are further dumping yarn and cloth at reduced prices, and the outlets for Chinese factories' yarn and cloth have been greatly reduced. Since the beginning of this year, the situation has been declining daily, ultimately causing yarn and cloth prices to reach the lowest figures since the first year of the Republic, while the stock of yarn and cloth in various places has reached an unprecedentedly large volume. At a time of extremely tight finances and high interest rates, manufacturers are almost all in a precarious situation. The association's factories, knowing that they should strive to invigorate themselves and recover from the decline, are unable to sell their products, even at extremely low prices. Raw material, cotton, is in short supply domestically, and its price does not decline in equal proportion to yarn and cloth. The use of foreign cotton is also costly due to expensive exchange rates. Comparing the lowest prices of yarn and cotton in March of this year with the entire year of the 19th year of the Republic, yarn has fallen by 24 taels, while cotton has risen by 3 taels. Therefore, there is not only no room for remedy between raw materials and products, but the business is becoming increasingly unfavorable. Secondly, we are starting from the opening and payment aspects, in order to slightly reduce costs. If you want to reduce the opening and payment, there are only two ways: reduce expenses and increase production. Looking back at the past three to five years, the wages of employees have gradually increased. It is already difficult not to increase them, how can we dare to reduce them again? As for increasing production, it was originally the only method for the national relief industry in recent times, but in terms of the current state of our country's factories, work has already been neglected, and maintaining the status quo is already challenging. Seeking to increase production is really like a dream. Therefore, rationalization has been promoted in various countries, but we still have no way to implement it. Speaking of this, it is really heartbreaking. The textile industry is in this kind of difficult and dangerous situation, not just overnight. The financial resources of the factories are weak, and they have long been exhausted and difficult to support. However, because the cotton industry is so important to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we have to reluctantly maintain it, waiting for a slight improvement in the timing. Since last winter, the situation has become increasingly worse, and there is no hope of a turnaround in the foreseeable future. Losses have been increasing, and it has become difficult to maintain operations. Under duress, a meeting of various factories was convened on April 10. Everyone agreed that foreign aggression and domestic worries are becoming increasingly serious. If there is no emergency relief, we will all perish together. After unanimous discussion by the factory representatives, it was resolved that all factories would uniformly implement the reduction of working hours from April 22 to May 21, and all factories would completely shut down day and night every Saturday and Sunday, in order to reduce production and maintain survival, etc. The association has already notified various factories to implement the measures on schedule. The association's resolution to reduce working hours is really a struggle for survival, seeking active relief. Otherwise, the products will accumulate daily and cannot be sold, and almost the entire industry will inevitably collapse. Not only will the factories be on the verge of bankruptcy, but the impact on the social economy will be beyond comparison with the current reduction in working hours. How should we properly plan for relief in the future? Your department cares about industry and must respond to the manufacturers' eager expectations."</p>
<p>(Representatives Going to the Capital) According to the Central News Agency, the meeting decided that the Cotton Mill Association would send representatives to the capital to appeal for relief. The municipal government will also send a telegram to the capital to appeal. The Cotton Mill Association designated Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, and Nie Lusheng as representatives. Rong has already taken the express train attached to a flower car to the capital at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Guo and Nie are scheduled to depart tomorrow (Monday). According to Nie Lusheng, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Cotton Mill Association, in order to seek fundamental relief, has decided to petition the authorities. A petition has been drafted, stating the dumping of foreign goods, the impact on Chinese yarn, and the resulting business downturn, and requesting several points, the main idea being to reduce burdens or provide subsidies and rewards.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Case of Factory Inspection Rights <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the government sending personnel to investigate the Public Concession's attempt to seize our factory inspection rights, Mayor Wu of our city issued a solemn statement the day before yesterday, and the Municipal Party Headquarters also issued a declaration the day before yesterday. The central government is paying unusual attention to this matter because it concerns our country's labor administration rights, and will send personnel to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the case and discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Expression by the Citizens' Federation <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating: "To the Honorable Directors, we find that our country's Factory Law and Factory Inspection Law have been promulgated and implemented. If there is no obstruction from extraterritorial forces, they will surely be implemented soon. The core of these factory laws and regulations is to uphold (humanitarianism), so they pay special attention to the health and safety of workers, and are based on the most advanced legal concepts in the world. According to the execution, there is practically no problem, and as a national law, there is practically no exception in legal principle. We do not know why the previous board of directors of your bureau, due to what background, misinterpreted the Yangjingbang Land Regulations and proposed to the current ratepayers' Westerners meeting to amend Article 34 of the appendices, adding an item on factory licensing, and still falsely claiming (humanitarianism) to confuse the public. Our country's factory laws and regulations, which are implemented within our country's territory, are indisputable in legal principle. The agreement or disagreement of the ratepayers within this district on this case is extraneous, and legally cannot have any effect. Our federation need not make any representations to your bureau, but from your bureau's standpoint, we feel that this amendment has raised an extremely serious and complex problem, and we must plan ahead to avoid future disputes, and make the following statements. The foundation of your bureau is built on the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. After the addition of the Chinese Director case in the 14th year of the Republic, its nature fundamentally changed. To put it bluntly, your bureau not only in fact, but also in legal principle, must abide by the opinions of all or the majority of the ratepayers in the district. Any partiality is discrimination, which would render its foundation unsound. Now, with regard to the amendment of the appendices, two points of view have arisen among the ratepayers: (disagreement) and (agreement). If your bureau recognizes its position and is free from misguidance, or has no subjective prejudice, it is truly like a woman between two mothers-in-law, difficult to navigate on both sides. As the saying goes, (There is nothing wrong with the world, but mediocre people disturb themselves.) This is what it means. Therefore, our federation is brainstorming and has no choice but to find a way to eliminate this case. However, observing your bureau's past behavior, we cannot help but speak out. It seems that the amendment is inevitable. The former General Director's radio broadcast, the speeches proposing the amendment, the intelligence office's propaganda, the public works department's supply and transportation, and the fact that it was carried out after the Chinese ratepayers had disagreed with the case, all seem to disregard the opinions of the ratepayers who account for more than 95% of the population and pay more than 55% of the taxes, and to forget their great contribution to maintaining the progress of municipal administration. This is tantamount to implying that the aforementioned ratepayers need not fulfill their obligations. Out of deep love, we cannot help but speak frankly, and respectfully ask for your understanding, so as to avoid unnecessary disputes. We are at the height of our hopes." Respectfully addressed to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>

<p>To Promote Active Anti-Japanese Work</p>
<p>Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, originally planned to go north as soon as possible to assist in military affairs and promote the resistance against Japan, but due to physical discomfort, he was delayed until now. It is now learned that Mr. Li left at 9:25 yesterday morning, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Migong and many attendants, on the early express train attached to a P·C504·flower car to the capital. According to Mr. Li, who spoke to reporters from the Central News Agency on the train, his blood pressure has recently been as high as 190 degrees, and he should not be traveling. However, resting in Shanghai would not be very beneficial, so if there is a way, he should do his best. This trip to the capital is to promote active anti-Japanese work and to make final suggestions to seek peace of mind. He plans to stay in Beijing for a while and then go north. The situation in North China has become even more tense recently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has decided to complete the arrangements for the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi Province in the shortest possible time and then leave for the north to command the anti-Japanese military affairs.</p>

The first draft will begin in Nanjing on the first day of next month. Zhang Zhiben, the Vice Chairman of the Committee, is still in Shanghai due to illness and has not returned. The drafting period is approaching in the blink of an eye. Sun took a Jinghu flower car to Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday to ask Zhang to go to the capital early, in spite of his illness, to engage in constitution drafting work. Those who came to Shanghai with Mr. Sun yesterday included Wu Jingxiong, Fu Rulin, Zhou Xiangxian, Ma Chaojun, Ma Yinchu, Fu Bingchang, and Chen Jianru.</p>

<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, according to the Shanghai Belgian Consulate General, the Belgian envoy Mr. Juye Moreau, after arriving in Peiping, will come to Shanghai again in the near future to prepare for the establishment of a Belgian embassy office in Shanghai, in order to facilitate contact with the outside world. The envoy has telegraphed Counselor Fuyoufu, who is still in Belgium, to come to Shanghai as soon as possible. As for the Sino-Belgian treaty, it was signed into a new treaty of equality on October 22 of the 17th year of the Republic, when Juye Moreau last served as the envoy to China, and it was renewed for three years after its expiration on October 22 last year, so there is no need to amend it at this time. The claim that the 1865 Sino-Belgian treaty will be amended is actually ignorance of the history of the Sino-Belgian treaty. The old treaty of 1865 was abolished four years ago. The new treaty signed in the 17th year of the Republic recognized the abandonment of consular jurisdiction, but stated that it must be implemented when all the countries concerned agree. The other articles are also completely based on the principle of equality. Mr. Wenhuo Tuo, the Belgian Consul General in Shanghai, was transferred to the Dutch Consul General and left Shanghai last Saturday with his wife. The new consul general will be concurrently held by Belgian Counselor Fuyoufu, who will come to Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Verde next month.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Lawyer Zhang Shizhao Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Handling of the Chen Peng Case Without Any Taboos</p>
<p>Also Praising Judicial Progress and Government Magnanimity</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Shizhao went to Beijing to handle the Chen Peng case, and the debate has ended. He returned to Shanghai yesterday. Because this case has caused a stir among the world, reporters paid a special visit to ask about the circumstances of the court hearing and to ask for his observations for reference. He said that this case is the biggest case in recent times. In the 20th year of the Republic, those who committed political suspicion, similar to Chen Peng, mostly died illegally. The Li Dazhao case and the Gao Renshan case are still in the memory of the Chinese people. Open trial and permission for defense lawyers to formally defend in court, this case should be considered the first time. This can indeed be seen as judicial progress, and the national government's magnanimity is very admirable. In his court defense, he was based on legal principles and referenced facts, and he said whatever he wanted to say, without any taboos. He secretly worried that he might have offended the government in some way, but when he left the court, a reporter from the Central News Agency firmly took the original manuscript away. The original text was not altered in the slightest, and the entire article was published in the Central Daily News. He met with important figures in the party, and they all praised him without any different opinions. It can be seen that the people who use the government's oppression of public opinion as an excuse and are silent are overly concerned and their assessment of the government's mentality is not accurate. It is unfair to let the government bear the name of slaughtering and humiliating scholars. At this time of national crisis, regardless of the government or the people, they should eliminate fraud and start from the strengths of others. The government's attitude towards the Chen case is open and upright, and he admires it very much. By analogy, why worry that the country will not see the light of day? Because the statements are relevant, they are recorded as right.</p>

<p>(Letter Requesting Protection) Mr. Oshanin, fearing that the White Russians in this port might take action when Mr. Bogomolov arrives and disembarks, went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fenlinqiao yesterday morning and met with Mr. Zhao Tiezhang, the Acting Director, to request a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, requesting them to send police to the wharf for protection.

<h3 id="e116">Japanese Consulate Receives a Threatening Letter <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Police Dispatch Detectives for Protection</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, it was learned yesterday (21st) that the Japanese Consulate General in this port had received a threatening letter in the name of the Republic of China Iron Blood Corps, stating: "Your country is destroying world peace, massacring our country's civilians, and seizing our territory. Therefore, our corps has decided to throw a bomb at your consulate tonight, tomorrow morning, afternoon, or evening. You must not publish this matter or make any preparations. This letter is just a warning, to show the great spirit of our Republic of China." The envelope was made of ordinary Manila paper. The post office stamp shows that it was mailed in the early morning of April 20. According to personnel from the Japanese Consulate, the letter was written in Chinese, the handwriting was scribbled, and the sentences were not very fluent, indicating that it was written by someone who had not received a high level of education. After receiving the letter, the Japanese Consulate immediately reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to protect it. As of this morning (22nd), there was still one Western police officer and four Japanese police officers and two Chinese police officers guarding the consulate.</p>

<p>Escorted by a Japanese Ship Yesterday to Shen</p>
<p>Subsequently Entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for Repair</p>
<p>The Yutong ship of the Yu Da Company ran aground on a reef near Gao Bei Mountain in Xinghua, Fujian on the 24th of last month. The insurance company hired a Japanese salvage company to try to save it. The salvage ship Arerumaru was dispatched from Moji to the scene of the accident to assist. This was recorded in previous reports. It has been a month since then. It is now learned that the ship was rescued by the Japanese ship, which first removed the cargo from the cabin, floated the ship, and then repaired the holes in the first two cabins. It was then towed to Xinghua for major repairs. Fortunately, the ship's machinery was not damaged. Therefore, the ship was escorted to Shanghai by a Japanese ship from Xinghua. It safely entered the port at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and immediately sailed into the Jiangnan Shipyard. It is scheduled to be inspected tomorrow and then repairs will begin. It is heard that in this accident, in addition to the ship's hull being punctured and most of the passengers and cargo being lost, the crew were completely safe, which is a great stroke of luck in misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Navigation Administration Will Set Up an Arbitration Council <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Inspection of Foreign Ships Has Not Yet Yielded Results</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhu Yaoting, the Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, at the bureau yesterday morning to inquire about new measures for managing navigation administration. He said the following:</p>
<h3 id="e119">Inspection of Foreign Ships <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>In view of the fact that foreign ships traveling domestically have not been inspected by our side, which is a loss of national rights, the Ministry of Communications has previously ordered the navigation administrations in various places to conduct negotiations to be able to implement inspections in the near future. Since receiving the order, this bureau has repeatedly negotiated with foreign businesses, but has not achieved a complete result. However, small foreign ships have been inspected by our side. The major ships will have to wait for further negotiations before a decision can be made. I have presented the details to the ministry for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Maritime Safety <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Our country has now joined the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and will implement it on the 14th of next month. This bureau has received an order from the ministry. The preparations have been notified to various ship bureaus, and more attention should be paid to the safety of passenger ships.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Recovery of Navigation Rights <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, foreign ships have freely traveled within our country, encroaching upon our inland river navigation rights. The Ministry of Transportation and the national shipping industry have all recognized the urgency of recovering inland river navigation rights. Therefore, active planning is underway to develop recovery methods. This will not only ensure the early recovery of seized sovereignty but also allow our national shipping industry to gradually develop.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Arbitration Committee <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>I have noted that unfortunate events, such as collisions between ships, are frequently reported. The occurrence of such unfortunate events not only endangers maritime safety but also leads to disputes over the subsequent arbitration of right and wrong. Historically, such disputes have been taken to court, and the courts often consult the Navigation Bureau regarding the circumstances of the incident. I believe that the Navigation Bureau, established to manage navigation affairs, should have an arbitration committee. Preparations are currently underway, and prominent figures from major shipping companies, as well as navigators and legal experts, will be invited to serve as committee members.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Expansion of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the divisional reviews of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement have now been completed. The progress regarding preparations for future mobilization is something that all members are eager to know. Since the many disturbances of last spring, the corps has experienced a number of difficulties and is currently working to remedy them. The foundation of the corps is three infantry companies. Although it is not yet time to adopt a battalion-level organization, this is the logical trend in infantry organization. In the future, these three companies may be expanded into three battalions. In addition, the various units can be divided into two categories, such as the Light Horse, the American Company, the Armored Car Company, and the Artillery Company, which may be used in areas with fewer restrictions than the infantry. Therefore, a centralized management approach will be adopted. However, in light of the difficulties experienced during last year's mobilization, one of the biggest causes was the excessive centralization of management. Therefore, in the future, where it does not lead to a loss of effectiveness, decentralization of management will be sought. As a result, minor changes will be made to the internal structure of the headquarters, such as building a new kitchen at the small target range. Currently, the corps has a total of twenty-three units, with members of different nationalities. According to the current organizational method, whenever a mobilization order is issued, the special function of each unit is to prepare for mobilization. The hope is that by the end of this year, each unit will have its own headquarters and mobilization supply room. A joint office will be established for every few units, so that in the future, members do not need to request everything from headquarters, thus avoiding delays. Furthermore, items such as military boots and rain hats are also being prepared to address previous shortcomings. Also, when the entire corps is deployed, there is a noticeable lack of personnel to handle routine back-office affairs. Work has now begun to organize a Reserve Company A, with the Commander-in-Chief adding technical training. In addition, the newly formed Air Defense Company of the corps held its second encampment during the Easter holiday, with training provided by British military instructors. As for the Western Boys' Student Corps, efforts are also being made to make progress, hoping to become a strong force.</p>

<p>Central North China Office requesting a telegram for relief</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng wrote to Xu Shiying yesterday, "Dear Mr. Jingren, I have just received a telegram from the Central North China Temporary Office stating that there are groups of refugees in the Xinyang area of Henan, requesting a message to Shanghai's charitable organizations, seeking immediate relief. The original telegram is copied above for your inspection and to forward to various organizations for relief efforts. I am honored to have your friendship. Attached is a telegram from Xinxiang. To Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng: I have just received a telegram from the Henan Provincial Department of Education Special District Inspection Group, stating: 'Refugees are gathering near Xinyang, Henan Province, crying along the way, snatching food. The counties of Huangchuan, Luoshan, Shangcheng, and Guangshan are the most affected by the exodus. They are emaciated and miserable. Furthermore, the Red bandits are resurging, with incidents of arson, murder, and looting frequently reported. If prompt relief is not provided, there is a deep concern that the Red bandits will exploit the situation. Once they erupt, suppression will be difficult.' Relief is essential. Please forward this message to charitable organizations in Shanghai to quickly provide relief. Central North China Temporary Office, Ma (official seal)."</p>

<p>The Quanzhang Guild's members, due to the former director Yang Jingshi's control of the guild affairs, misuse of public funds, destruction of education, and oppression of fellow villagers, convened a meeting of all members yesterday morning and petitioned the municipal government, municipal party headquarters, and social bureau, appealing for justice and ordering the effective cessation of all activities by the former director. The petition to the municipal government is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Petition Details <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>More than 500 members of the guild arrived at the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Government at 11:35 AM to petition. They nominated representatives Wang Zansheng, Guo Zhaolin, Huang Yunzhong, Lu Yongsheng, and Xie Tinghui to enter the municipal government and state their petition. They were received by Secretary Guo of the municipal government, who promised to forward the details to the mayor for review. The representatives were satisfied. Around 12:00 PM, they also petitioned the municipal party headquarters and the social bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Petition Submission <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to your esteemed government for the record, requesting the effective cessation of all activities and illegal re-elections by the former director to avoid increased disputes. Your humble guild has been subjected to the former director's control of guild affairs, misuse of public funds, destruction of education, and oppression of fellow villagers, engaging in all kinds of illegal activities to the extreme. Therefore, all members believe that reorganization is necessary. On April 5th, a meeting of fellow villagers was held at the guild, and a unanimous resolution was passed to reorganize, which has already been submitted to your esteemed government for the record. However, the former director Yang Jingshi and others intend to seize the guild's property and attempt to deceive your esteemed government, hoping to hold another election, which is clearly driven by ulterior motives. All members of the guild are compelled to appeal to your esteemed government for justice, ordering the effective cessation of all activities by the former director and immediately handling the handover procedures. This would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Rectifying Lawyers' Ethics and Professional Conduct <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Drafts of Pleadings Must Not Be Sent to Newspapers in Advance</p>
<p>Official Titles Must Not Be Displayed on Door Signs for Solicitation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, which stated: "Regarding the implementation of orders, we have received Order No. 397 from the Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which contains Order No. 945 from the Ministry of Justice. Lawyers are specially authorized by the state to represent or defend people in lawsuits. They should cultivate moral integrity internally and uphold respect externally. They should not engage in actions that are improper and invite criticism. Recently, we have heard that some lawyers draft pleadings for others, and either after submitting them or even before submitting them, they send the drafts to newspapers. The content of these lawsuits often contains embellished language, accusations, and extravagant descriptions that are not necessary for attack or defense in litigation, merely harming the reputation and credibility of the opposing party. If there is no ulterior motive, why would they do this? We have also heard that some lawyers who previously held public office display their former official titles in newspapers and on door signs, showing off themselves. With such a noble profession, why engage in the same practices as merchants, boasting and soliciting business? The above two points are closely related to the ethics and professional conduct of lawyers and must be clearly emphasized to warn future practitioners. Therefore, we order you to instruct the chief prosecutors of the courts under your jurisdiction to issue orders to the lawyer associations under their jurisdiction to strictly prohibit these practices to prevent abuses and dispel public criticism. This order is equivalent to this order. We hereby order you, the chief prosecutor, to order the lawyer association under your jurisdiction to strictly prohibit these practices. This order is equivalent to this order. We hereby order you, the lawyer association, to comply with this order." After receiving the order, the association submitted it to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members, who resolved to notify all members to strictly comply with the ministry's orders and prohibitions.</p>

<p>Zhao Genlin to Eight Years, Zhao Wenhao to Seven Years</p>
<p>Chen Hongcai, who runs a fruit store in Dongxing Lane, Minquan Road, hired Zhao Genlin as a clerk. Zhao has a volatile temper and often beats people. One day, a deaf-mute man named Chen Xuelu went to buy fruit, but because he could not speak clearly, he angered Zhao Genlin, who beat him. Zhao Wenhao, a former teacher, gave Zhao Genlin a sharp knife and incited him to violence, resulting in the mute man's left kidney being pierced. He died before he could be taken to the hospital. The Public Security Bureau arrested Zhao Genlin and Zhao Wenhao and handed them over to the local court. After prosecutor Yang An's thorough investigation, and with Zhao Genlin confessing that Zhao Wenhao had given him the knife to kill, it was determined that they had malicious intentions, and they were prosecuted. After being tried by Judge He Renji, they were sentenced yesterday. Zhao Genlin was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and Zhao Wenhao was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods sent a letter to the Shanghai Handkerchief Industry Association yesterday: "Dear Sirs, according to a confidential report from a member, some handkerchief factories are using enemy goods in order to make a profit. Please investigate. During this time of national crisis and economic panic, it is outrageous for handkerchief factories to use enemy goods. It not only undermines the movement to promote national goods but also provides an opportunity for enemy goods to be dumped on the market. There are undoubtedly patriotic individuals in your industry, but if you continue to tolerate and harbor unscrupulous merchants and allow them to pass off enemy goods as national goods, it will tarnish your reputation. We hereby request your association to promptly send personnel to thoroughly investigate all factories and strictly prohibit the use of enemy goods in order to protect national goods and enhance your industry's reputation. We look forward to your response."</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Case of Yang Yao's Suicide by Poisoning - Corpse Still Needs to Be Autopsied <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yao, a 21-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 133 Xiamen Road, had an argument with her husband, Yang Baofa, on the 19th of this month. She went to bed angry. On the morning of the 21st, the family's maid, Wang Axiang, suddenly saw her moaning in bed. She reported it to her husband, who returned home to check on her, only to find that she had already died. After the Laozha Gate Patrol Station learned of this, they ordered detectives to investigate. Since there was no evidence of poisoning, the body was taken to the forensic examination center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was notified, and prosecutor Guo Wei was appointed to examine the body and begin the case. According to the husband, Yang Saifa, 23 years old, who works as a clerk at the Huafeng Flour Mill, his wife had been scolding him for gambling on the 19th, and they had argued. The next morning, he went to work at the mill and did not return home that night. Later, his family called him, saying that his wife was in critical condition. He immediately returned home, only to find that she was already dead. He also said that his parents were not at home at the time. According to Western Constable Geng Wen, the patrol station has not been able to determine the cause of the woman's death and requested an autopsy to determine the truth. Mr. Guo then ordered that an autopsy be performed and scheduled another hearing for next Tuesday. The body will be released to her husband, Yang Baofa, after the autopsy.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YWCA received a letter last month from Consul Kuang Guanglin in Manila, stating: "The Philippine government will send members to China to investigate commerce, and many family members will accompany them. The team members have requested that appropriate tours for women and children be arranged. Please provide all possible assistance to strengthen friendship." Now that the team members have arrived in Shanghai, the YWCA, in conjunction with the Chinese Women's Association, the Chinese Christian Women's Association, and the International Branch of the Shanghai YWCA, has scheduled a welcome tea party for the members of the Philippine Investigation Team at 5:00 PM on the 24th of this month at No. 8 Yuanmingyuan Road.

<h3 id="e139">A Bad Check Paid for a Party at a Brothel <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Xuegeng, Zhu Mengjue, and Xu Weiming Accused of Fraud</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th of last month, a local man named Zhu Xuegeng hosted a banquet at the Xiaochen brothel at No. 5 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road. The guests included Zhu Mengjue, Xu Weiming, and eight others. They entertained the prostitutes and drank wine until they dispersed. The cost of the wine and food totaled 54 yuan. Zhu Xuegeng pocketed the money that the guests had given him for the tickets and instead signed a postdated check No. 31 from the West District branch of the Kending Bank for 100 yuan, giving it to the prostitute Xiaochen Laoqi as payment for ten "flower heads" (entertainment fees). The prostitute, initially not suspecting that it was a bad check, accepted it. When she tried to cash it on the due date, the bank found that there were no funds and returned the check. The prostitute then realized she had been cheated and reported it to the Laozha Gate Patrol Station, requesting an investigation. Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Xiaochen Laoqi learned that Zhu Xuegeng was hosting another banquet at the Hongmudan brothel in the same lane. She immediately went there to negotiate a cash exchange, but Zhu refused. She then notified the patrol station, and Chinese detective Zhao Jintang was ordered to arrest Zhu. At around 9:00 AM, he was sent to the criminal division of the First Special Court. Patrol Station lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the patrol station was prosecuting Zhu Xuegeng for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code and that Zhu Xuegeng had also conspired with Zhu Mengjue and Xu Weiming to commit two similar cases: (1) On the 22nd of last month, Xu Weiming hosted a banquet at the Linfang brothel at No. 8 Huile Lane. He pocketed the money that the guests had given him for the tickets, and the 50 yuan for the wine and food was paid with a 100-yuan check, which was also returned for insufficient funds. (2) On the 28th of last month, Zhu Mengjue hosted a banquet at the Sujun brothel at No. 6 Fuxiang Lane. He also pocketed the money for the tickets, and the 60 yuan for the wine and food was paid with a 120-yuan bad check. Looking at the above two checks and the check given to Xiaochen by Zhu, they are from the same bank, with the same account name, and with the same issuer, that is, the same check account number. This shows that it was a conspiracy to defraud and there is no doubt about it. However, the patrol station has not yet completed its investigation, so he requested that the hearing be postponed to facilitate the investigation. The prostitutes Xiaochen, Linfang, and Sujun then submitted reports describing the situation at the time. When Zhu Xuegeng was questioned, he claimed that he had given the money that should have been paid to Zhu Mengjue, and Zhu said that it was better to go to the bank, so he signed a check to the brothel. Lawyer Li immediately stated that it was unlikely that the defendant, who was hosting a banquet, would not want to save face and personally pay the brothel, but would voluntarily entrust a friend to do so. Therefore, his defense was completely unreasonable. Judge Wu Xiangzu reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be postponed for one week for further hearing.</p>

<p>Ye Xiangyun, 37 years old, from Dongting Mountain, worked at a silk factory in Hangzhou. He married a woman named Jin, 34 years old. They initially lived in Tangxi, Hangzhou. They had no children, so they adopted a daughter named Lanzhu, 13 years old. Later, they had four children in a row: Qingqi, 11 years old (male); Jingyun, 8 years old (female); Qingzeng, 4 years old (male); and Qingsheng, 2 years old (male). This made it difficult to make ends meet. This year, he lost his job. Therefore, on March 17th of this year, Ye and his wife brought their children to Shanghai and lived at No. 8 Jiande New Village, Song Park Road, Zhabei. Unfortunately, after moving in, everyone in the family became ill, so they believed the house was unlucky and moved to No. 11. On April 12th, Ye's wife bought several enemy yellow croakers and cooked them for the children to eat. Because they were very cheap, she let the children eat a lot. After eating, Lanzhu, Qingqi, and Qingzeng became ill that night. Their hands and feet swelled up, especially Lanzhu, whose chest, abdomen, and head swelled up. They called a doctor, but it was ineffective. Ye went to Hangzhou to find work, so Lanzhu was not treated for several days. Neighbors mistakenly believed that Ye did not care for Lanzhu because she was not his biological daughter, so they reported it to the China Charity Association on Museum Road. Worker Wang Yiguan and the police chief from the Fifth District Patrol Station went to investigate. They took Lanzhu and sent her to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, Lanzhu cried in pain all night, and her condition worsened. The hospital gave her an injection, but it was to no avail. She died yesterday. Ye has returned to Shanghai. Therefore, the Fifth District Police Station ordered the local guarantor Tan Genggeng to accompany Ye Xiangyun to the local court to report the death. Prosecutor Yang An and others were appointed to investigate.</p>

<p>丨Legal Procedures to Be Pursued with Chinese Merchants First丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association is negotiating with Chinese and foreign insurance companies in Shanghai regarding the issue of fire insurance compensation in Zhabei. However, no progress has been made, and tens of thousands of disaster victims are anxiously awaiting relief, relying entirely on this compensation. Therefore, they have recently sent letters requesting the association and the Claims Committee to fight for their rights in order to achieve the goal of compensation. It is understood that the association will first pursue legal procedures with Chinese insurance companies in order to resolve the issue first. The Claims Committee has also requested the Municipal Government to lead and expedite negotiations with foreign merchants. The response from the foreign merchants' head office is currently pending. According to standing committee members Mu Yueqiu and Liang Baolin, the association had been suspended due to the national crisis, but the constant urging from disaster victims forced them to resume negotiations in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome.</p>

<p>Yi Tai Flees in Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>Lu Bohong, the general manager of the Chinese Electrical Company, recently discovered that the number codes on the electric meters in the engine room were being burned off daily. Comparing these to the figures billed to customers revealed a shortage of millions of units, resulting in significant losses. Suspecting internal fraud involving collusion with users to steal electricity, a confidential report was received. It was verified that Yi Tai, a clerk in the lighting department responsible for sealing electric meters with lead, was involved. He had been contacting customers and privately removing the lead seals from the meters, altering the readings. Therefore, Lu Bohong, the company's general manager, petitioned the local court to arrest and investigate him. However, Yi Tai, knowing he was guilty and fearing punishment, fled upon hearing the news. It is now learned that the company has already separately requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the British and French police to issue a wanted notice.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Zhucheng Chamber of Commerce, Shandong, requesting efforts to abolish meat inspection before entering the city. The original letter stated: "We have received a telegram from Jiang on behalf of the Shanghai Cured Meat and Ham Trade Association, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau attempted to implement inspections and impose heavy taxes on cured meat and ham products last year. Our association fought strongly against this and sent representatives to Beijing to petition. The Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan issued an order to abolish it. Unexpectedly, on March 30th, the bureau suddenly issued a notice to implement the inspection on April 1st. The matter is sudden and deeply shocking. Such harsh policies are unacceptable. This concerns the vital interests of the entire industry, and we should rise up together to strive for abolition. We have fully explained the reasons for opposition in the association's previous declarations and submissions to the Executive Yuan. We believe your association is well aware of the situation and do not need to reiterate it. However, your association leads the commercial sector and shares its joys and sorrows. It has an inescapable responsibility to protect it. We respectfully request that you uphold justice, fight reasonably, and achieve the goal of abolition to maintain our business. This would be a great act of benevolence. Otherwise, the cured meat industry in Shandong Province will have no choice but to unite and strike to resist." Therefore, we have prepared a document outlining the reasons for requesting the abolishment of inspection for your review and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Party Members Sent to Assist in Trial of North China Bookstore Selling Banned Books <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>(First Implementation of Party Member Jury System)</p>
<p>(Judgment Scheduled for the 27th of This Month)</p>
<p>Previously, the North China Bookstore was found to be selling reactionary books banned by the authorities. The Procuratorate of the Special District Court issued a search warrant and sent police to search the bookstore, seizing several types of books. These were submitted to the Procuratorate of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for investigation. The prosecution brought charges against Xu Rongqing, the manager of the bookstore. The same-level Criminal Court sentenced Xu Rongqing on July 3rd of the previous year to one year of imprisonment for propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. Xu appealed to the Supreme Court. After reviewing the case, the Supreme Court found that the original judgment did not sufficiently examine whether the defendant intentionally sold the banned books or whether it was due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, the case was sent back to the Second Branch of the High Court for a retrial. According to regulations, cases of this type, after appeal and remand for retrial, should have party members from the local highest party headquarters assisting in the trial. Therefore, President Shen of the Second Branch of the High Court specifically notified the Municipal Party Headquarters of the trial date and requested the immediate dispatch of members to assist in the trial. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division Chief Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with Judge Zhao Tong, Zhou Han, and Prosecutor Zhang Junqing, opened the trial. The Municipal Party Headquarters also sent six members – Wang Manyun, Wang Longzhang, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Chu, Cao Hanfang, and Yang Juren – to assist in the trial and participate in the deliberations of the presiding judges. Wang was elected as the chairman of the deliberation. This system is the first time this kind of trial has been carried out in the Second Branch of the High Court. The judgment is scheduled to be pronounced on the afternoon of the 27th of this month. It is said that the jurors will not be present at the time of sentencing.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association’s South Shanghai Shelter for the Poor closed at the end of last month, over one hundred and eighty poor children, including Jiao Xinhua, remained. Wang Yiting, a philanthropist of the association, felt that these orphans were helpless and without support. If they were dispersed, they would inevitably become vagrant. To provide thorough help, he consulted with Mr. Wu Binyan, director of the Zhabei Charity Organization, who agreed to accommodate them in the Poor People’s Vocational Training Center in Liuying Road, Zhabei, so they could receive education and learn industrial skills. The internal facilities of the center have been completed, so yesterday, the managers, including Zhang Zixin, reorganized the clothing and socks of the poor children, prepared a register, and sent them to the Zhabei Poor People’s Vocational Training Center for accommodation.</p>

<p>Shen Rongjin, 23 years old, a native of Shaoxing, Yuyao, residing at No. 581 Malan Road, French Concession, was in the silk weaving business. Recently, due to illness, he had been resting at home. At 1:40 PM on the 21st, his nephew Fang Chengxin (the apprentice of his sister’s lover) and four friends, including Jiao Delong, accompanied him to see a doctor. While walking along Beile Road, the five were playing around as they walked north. At the front of No. 689, for some unknown reason, Fang suddenly pushed Shen, causing Shen to fall to the ground. Shao Dianchen (Shandong native), the driver of the French Municipal Council’s F752 garbage truck, was driving south to north and was unable to avoid him in time, hitting Shen’s head. Upon seeing this, the police brought the driver, the injured person, and Fang into the police station. Shortly after, Shen died. The Transportation Department notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall to transport the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, they reported to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate, which appointed Prosecutor Deng Baosun to inspect the body and take charge of the case. The Deputy Director of the Transportation Department reported the previous events and summoned the driver, Fang Chengxin, Jiao Delong, and Shen’s sister, Zhang Shen, for questioning. After questioning everyone, Deng ruled that Shen Rongjin died from being hit by a car. The family was allowed to claim the body, and the defendant was handled by the Transportation Department for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Chen Zhu Abducts and Sells a Young Girl <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Discovered by Female and Child Welfare Association Investigator</p>
<p>Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Association for the Relief of Women and Children, boarded the Taigu Company's Tianlun steamship bound for Tianjin at 10:00 AM yesterday. They noticed a short, young girl on board who looked suspicious. They immediately asked for her name and age. She claimed to be Chen Ashun, 21 years old, from Yangzhou. The two investigators were surprised that she said she was 21 years old, but after carefully observing her face, she looked at most 15 or 16 years old. There must be a reason, so they interrogated her sternly. The girl then revealed the truth. She said she was actually 16 years old and had been working as a caregiver at the Zhang family at No. 130 Zhuyang Lane, Kader Road. Three days ago, Chen Zhu, a female fellow villager of hers, told her that the wages earned by helping other people in their home were very meagre and that it would be better to go with her to work in a factory in Tianjin, where she could earn wages of twenty or thirty yuan per month. Hearing this, she was overjoyed and took the opportunity to leave without saying goodbye and went with the woman to stay at a certain inn. Later, the woman brought a man she did not know to her room to sleep with her and was repeatedly raped for two nights. Only today did the woman take her to the ship to go to Tianjin to work and the reason she said she was 21 was because the woman had told her to say that. Hearing these words, the investigators knew that this girl was about to be abducted and sold. They asked her where the woman was now, and she said she was sitting in the lower cabin. The two investigators then instructed her to identify and detain the woman and reported it to the Customs Water Police Station. Detective Gu Wenkui was dispatched and brought them back to the police station. The Director of the Criminal Department questioned them separately. First, the girl recounted the circumstances of her being lured, and then the defendant claimed to be Chen Zhu, 30 years old, from Yangzhou, and firmly denied any abduction. However, the police examined the defendant's fingerprints and discovered that she had previously committed an abduction case. There was no use denying it, and she was immediately sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>

The 530 trademark silk, yarn, hemp, and cotton socks for men and women are popular at home and abroad and have been well received by the public.

<h3 id="e157">The Villainous Drama of Throwing Excrement <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Two Women Arrested</p>
<p>Laozha Bridge South End, Public Concession, is lined with wholesale goods businesses. Every morning, farmers hire boats from the countryside to load local goods (such as various vegetables, sweet potatoes, sorghum, bamboo shoots, watermelons, and water chestnuts) to Shanghai, where they dock at the pier. Wholesale goods businesses send their staff to the boats to carry the goods ashore. Because there is no space to accommodate them in the market, they are arranged on the open space along the pier and at the entrances of the businesses, allowing customers to select and business employees to weigh and price the goods. This has become customary. Unexpectedly, a group of Jiangbei women and children often go to the pier and the entrances of various businesses to steal goods when they have the chance. Both the businesses and the customers suffer losses, and the numbers are uncountable. The business owners have jointly hired Indian guards and a Shandong person to patrol back and forth near the businesses to prevent theft. This trend has been curbed somewhat, but those people hate them to the bone. Yesterday morning, more than a dozen Jiangbei women were discovered stealing bamboo shoots and other goods by the Indian guard. At that time, dozens of their accomplices gathered (mostly women and children) and made things difficult for the Indian guard, resisting arrest. They all threw dirty objects such as excrement at the Indian guard, causing the Indian guard's head, face, and clothes to be covered with excrement, and the stench was overwhelming. The women and children immediately dispersed and fled. The Indian guard urgently blew his whistle and summoned patrolling police officers No. 2040 and No. 1927 to help pursue and arrest two of the accomplice women, who were taken to the police station to await investigation.</p>

<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 82, opposite Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, Public Concession, at the Zhongxinji Chinese and Western Tailor Shop. Various fire brigades drove to the scene to put out the fire and extinguished it soon after. Only the rear half of the two-story building was destroyed, but the nearby residents were all greatly alarmed.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Red Pill Manufacturing Ring Busted at Maurice Village <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>(Front and Back Doors Closed All Day)</p>
<p>(Large Quantity of Red Pills Confiscated)</p>
<p>Maurice Village is the property of Maurice and was recently built but has not yet been fully completed. However, suspicious tenants have recently moved into the house at No. 60 in the village. Someone reported this to the Xin Zha Police Station. Detective Chief Te, Detective Li Shizhong, and Detective Yang Xinzheng conducted an investigation. The detective was ordered to find a way to investigate, but at first, there were no leads. Later, it was found that although the front and back doors of No. 60 were closed all day long, the watchman Liu Yunting never left the door. Therefore, Liu was asked about the residents in the house. According to Liu, on the 15th of this month, Maurice's chauffeur, Mao Yunting, brought a Western-dressed man to rent the house and asked him for the key to lead the Western-dressed man inside. He did not know anything else. The detective then asked the Westerner Maurice, who confirmed that Liu was indeed his watchman. Therefore, they went to the house again to investigate, but both doors were tightly closed, and no one answered the door when they knocked. So they peeked through the cracks in the door and saw that the lights inside the house were bright. Therefore, they waited in the corner to observe the situation. Not long after, the door opened, and a Western-dressed man came out. The detective tried to rush in, but before he could even take a step, the door was closed by the Western-dressed man, and he disappeared without a trace. The two detectives then decided to enter the house from the neighboring house over the wall and searched carefully. Although the interior had not yet been fully renovated, the layout was very similar to a place where drugs were being made. A large number of manufactured red pills, as well as raw materials and manufacturing equipment for making drugs, were confiscated and taken back to the police station. In addition, a note was found.</p>
<p>Because there might be some connection between No. 121 and this organization, they immediately went to search No. 221 and found another three large bags of red pills and raw materials for making the pills, as well as three chartered cars. The undercarriage of the cars was very different from ordinary chartered cars, and it was suspected that they were used to transport red pills. Together with Liu Ni, a 58-year-old Chongming woman who lived in the house, they were taken to the police station. The woman was temporarily detained in the women's prison. It was also found that the house at No. 221 was rented by the gatekeeper Liu Yunting. Later, Lu Afu from Haimen and Yang Baogan from Chongming went to the house, causing the detectives stationed in the house to arrest them. Lu and Yang admitted to being chartered car drivers, but the clothes they were wearing were the same style. Later, the detectives found a way to arrest the Western-dressed man, who said his name was Du Xuefeng, a native of Shandong, and that Liu Yunting was hired by him, with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. Yesterday morning, the police sent a group of men and women to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qian Wenji interrogated them. Du hired lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend him. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case and requested that Du and others be temporarily detained because everything still needed to be investigated. Judge Qian immediately approved the request. The retrial date was changed, and Du Yunfeng and others were still detained separately.</p>

No. 81 horse-drawn carriage, No. 2579, which was traveling east and west. At the time, both vehicles were traveling at high speed, resulting in the complete destruction of the front of the Yunfei vehicle and the collapse of the entire 81 vehicle. Both drivers were seriously injured. The nearby patrolmen witnessed this and immediately reported it to the police station, who notified a hospital to send an ambulance. The two injured drivers were taken to the hospital for treatment. It is said that their injuries were very serious, and one of them may be in danger of death.</p>
<p>Child Injured by Car At around 10:00 PM last night, a pedestrian, Mr. Hu, was walking along Nanjing Road Bund with his son, Gengsheng, who was eight years old.

<p>To the esteemed editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Chen Kan, who states that the news published in various newspapers today regarding Chen Kan's accusation against Yuan Xilian is inconsistent with the facts. (1) This case involves lawyer Yuan Xilian forging case files related to an arrest warrant and strict punishment order. The facts are all present and not merely empty claims. Last year, my client participated in a rural revitalization movement and was selected to go to the capital to petition. He was then falsely accused by Mr. Lin of damaging his reputation and falsely reported as a fugitive. Lawyer Yuan even represented Mr. Lin in publishing an arrest warrant, creating something out of nothing. The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court has already sentenced Mr. Lin, Yuan's client, to two months in prison. Public opinion will determine who is right and wrong. (2) Yesterday's trial was scheduled, but because the ruling was received too late, there was not enough time to attend court. It was not a case of simply not appearing. (3) The accusation is only against lawyer Yuan Xilian and does not involve Mr. Lin. The above are all facts. I request that your esteemed newspaper, through your legal representatives, forward this letter to various newspapers for correction. I hereby send this letter and hope for a correction to be printed. Respectfully, Lawyer Qiu Hanping, April 22nd.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisory</p>
<h3 id="e169">A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question: "Can We Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>(10) (5) Mr. Ye Mengying from this city sent a letter respectfully questioning Mr. Zhu Tianqing about the rural problem ("Can We Return to the Countryside?"). This is indeed a significant issue. After reading the writings of the gentlemen participating in the discussion, I deeply feel that Mr. Liu Siming's views are indeed good. However, he did not tell us how we can return. Of course, Mr. Liu himself knows, but it may not be convenient to publish it. Reading the "Reader's Advisory" on the 13th, I discovered Mr. Zhu Tianqing's letter sympathizing with Mr. You. I carefully read his article and felt that Mr. Zhu and Mr. You are singing the same tune. Mr. Zhu has already read several of Mr. Liu's letters, and if Mr. Zhu is not nearsighted or wearing colored glasses, he should have understood long ago. Now, to add to Mr. You's article is actually not beautiful. Now I will discuss Mr. Zhu's letter, and I hope Mr. Zhu will accept it in good faith.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also advocates creating a "new kind of Arcadia," but his "new kind of Arcadia" does not ignore politics and also emphasizes rural education. Therefore, he advocates that anyone who feels "bored or lonely living in the city" should return to the countryside, especially during times of "national crisis," it is better to escape to a "new kind of Arcadia." Mr. Zhu's meaning clearly expresses a thought of escaping from the world.</p>
<p>Since we are discussing the question "Can we return to the countryside?", we must first seek to understand why we were squeezed into the city from the countryside. The reason why we are not welcome in the countryside is not as simple as Mr. Zhu said, such as the lack of development in rural education in China, farmers not knowing how to improve seeds, poor farming tools, warlord internal warfare, and communist disturbances, etc. These are only external appearances, not the internal workings. To be honest, the trouble with China is that everyone just parrots what others say. Mr. Zhu does not seek to understand the principle of "why the countryside does not accommodate us" but blindly tries to squeeze back into the countryside. May I ask if Mr. You's method is feasible for us poor people? Unless Mr. Zhu is a property owner, or wealthy, and can raise a few hundred yuan to return to the countryside to create a "new kind of Arcadia." As for us, we hardly have any hometowns left. May I ask where can we find a piece of land for us to create a new Arcadia? Now, in the city, we still have trouble finding enough food to eat for tomorrow, so how can we plan to raise a few hundred yuan? Since Mr. Zhu and Mr. You hold the grand ambition of saving the world and saving people, then why not spare some money to help us create a new kind of Arcadia? In reality, if Mr. Zhu and Mr. You truly have the desire to save the world and save people, and can spare a batch of money to help the homeless return to the countryside to create a new kind of Arcadia, I can immediately introduce you to thousands and millions of poor people, and I can even guarantee that even if you treat them poorly, they will not revolt because they are even worse off than me now, with only one big cake to eat each day, or even nothing to eat.</p>
<p>The reasons why the countryside cannot accommodate us, as Mr. Zhu said, are just superficial talk. The real reasons lie in the current social system. Because the current system is bad, it creates warlord internal warfare. Warlord internal warfare causes the lack of development in rural education. The lack of development in rural education prevents farmers from knowing how to improve seeds and tools. Because there is warlord infighting, it increases exorbitant taxes. If exorbitant taxes are not enough, they also force people to plant opium, openly ordering the people to smoke opium. In addition, the intrusion of international imperialist commodities has led to the bankruptcy of Chinese handicraft industries. International imperialism, due to the competition for markets, has also caused internal warfare among our country's warlords, and opened up concessions, agreed to tariffs... Chinese rural areas are subjected to the exploitation of international imperialism and the oppression of domestic feudal forces. May I ask them how they cannot abandon the original "old Arcadia" and run to the city to become workers? Do you understand these, Mr. Zhu?</p>
<p>After understanding the reasons why we cannot be accommodated in the countryside, then we must understand what kind of society we are in now, and then we can know why we cannot return to the countryside. Only after we can understand why we cannot return to the countryside can we talk about rescuing the countryside. Otherwise, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Under the current state of affairs, there is no way to return to the countryside. "New kind of Arcadia" is just a humanitarian dream of a group of bureaucrats and so-called wealthy merchants. Since we cannot return to the countryside, and cannot find jobs in the city, this is the beginning of the collapse of the current society, and also the dawn of the new society of the future. There are many ways out, but those are things that Mr. You and Mr. Zhu will not know and are unwilling to know. Mr. Zhu's second section is even more ridiculous and contradictory. If we follow Mr. Zhu's opinion and high view of "destroy as much as you want, build as much as you want," then Mr. Zhu, you clearly expose the weakness of your theory. May I ask, if I did manage to raise a few hundred yuan and run to the countryside to implement Mr. You's "new kind of Arcadia" plan, but before the creation is complete, civil war breaks out, and then the communists come, and local tyrants and evil gentry exploit us one after another, may I ask Mr. Zhu, if destruction is allowed to continue, then where will my money come from to rebuild the "new kind of Arcadia"? Mr. Zhu, you cannot even understand this kind of simple social common sense, so how can you talk about a "new kind of Arcadia"? Unless you want to invite a group of heavenly soldiers and generals from the "Investiture of the Gods" to help you. Mr. Zhu, your "new kind of Arcadia" is certainly better than Tao Qian's fantastical "Peach Blossom Spring", but if you understand the reason why the current society does not allow you to build a "new kind of Arcadia", I think you will never sleep in bed during the day and have this kind of "springtime chaotic dream".</p>
<p>I have already discussed the first half of the third section, so there is no need to say more. Now let's talk about the bankruptcy of rural areas in the United States and Japan. Of course, I am a poor boy who has not only never left the country, but also never been to the east, north, west, or central parts of China. I certainly cannot talk about knowing the state of farmer bankruptcy in the United States, Japan, etc. However, if you and I are still lucky enough to read a copy of Shenbao, we should not be forgetful to this extent. Didn't you see the American veterans petitioning the White House? Didn't you see Japanese farmers selling their daughters into prostitution? Didn't you see Africans with only a piece of cloth covering their lower bodies? ... Mr. Zhu, I'm sorry, I have not traveled to rural areas abroad, although I know a lot, I am afraid you will say I am spreading rumors and taking up too much space. If you want to know, you might as well read more Chinese and foreign publications, whether socialist or capitalist, as long as you are not nearsighted and you do not wear colored glasses, you will always be able to read it, so that you know, there is no need to discuss the fourth section. I wrote all this in one breath, and I know that many mistakes are inevitable. However, based on my enthusiasm and with my shallow knowledge, I have written what I know, and I hope that the readers will give me some guidance so that we poor boys who have not entered university and bought original books can gain more knowledge.</p>

<p>Wu Chuliang, Zhu Jiarang, etc., are Elected as Directors</p>
<p>The third council of the Boy Scouts of this city held an election meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. Jiang Wushi of the Boy Scout General Association attended the meeting to supervise the election. Tong Hangbai, representative of the City Party Headquarters, and Du Gang, representative of the City Education Bureau, attended to provide guidance. One hundred and three boy scout service members attended the meeting. Two small teams of Boy Scouts from the East Asia Physical Education College were assigned to host. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Agenda of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Public nomination of chairman; (3) All stand at attention; (4) Sing the party song; (5) Pay the highest respect to the party flag, national flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (6) The chairman respectfully reads Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; (7) Silent tribute; (8) Report: (A) Purpose of the meeting; (B) Review of the work of the second council; (9) Supervisor's speech; (10) Speech by the representative of the City Party Headquarters; (11) Speech by the representative of the City Education Bureau; (12) Election; (13) Vote counting; (14) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Work Report: The meeting opened at 2:00 PM. The presidium consisted of Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao, and Wu Chuliang. The master of ceremonies was Shen _, and the recorders were Xie Yanbo and Zhao Weizu. First, Chairman Leng Xueqiao reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Luo Lie, secretary of the council, reported on the work of the second council, stating briefly that the work of the association could be divided into three periods. The first period was before the war, before January 28th. The important work included holding a city-wide team leader training camp, a city-wide team leader camp, and planning the fourth city-wide review and grand camp, handling service member registration, etc. The second period was during the war, when the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out. The daily work of the association was suspended, and all efforts were focused on organizing the battlefield service corps, appointing Wang Gang as the commander-in-chief, and Leng Xueqiao and Luo Lie as deputy commanders. Fifteen refugee camps were set up in the rear, seven hospitals for wounded soldiers were guarded, and more than 300 working Boy Scouts were stationed. More than 200 working Boy Scouts were stationed with the army in the front. After the war, 50 Boy Scouts were assigned to work on wartime health and epidemic prevention in the four counties of Baojia, Tai, and Kun. The third period was after the war, from January 28th to the present. Important work included fundraising for the Chinese Boy Scout aircraft, promoting relief tickets for northeastern refugees, and preparing for the re-election of the council.</p>
<p>Supervisor's Speech: Supervisor Jiang Wushi said in his speech that the re-election of the Shanghai Boy Scout Council was held today. The Shanghai Boy Scouts had performed well in the past, with a larger number than other places, and occupied an important position. During this critical period of national crisis, it is hoped that they will continue to work hard and strive for national glory based on their past achievements. It must be known that China is a colonial country, and the greatest purpose of the Boy Scouts' responsibility is to save the country and save the nation. This is different from the nature of Boy Scouts in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Italy, and Russia. Our nation is currently in a state of decline, and everyone has a psychology of luck. Therefore, China must have organized and disciplined people to save the country, and our Boy Scouts are trained citizens. It is hoped that everyone will exercise their bodies, work hard, and take on the responsibility of saving the country.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: Tong Hangbai, representative of the City Party Headquarters, said in his speech that the past work of the Shanghai Boy Scouts has been very good, which makes us very comforted. However, after careful investigation, there are still areas that are not satisfactory, such as in terms of organization. There are so many schools in Shanghai, but there are only a dozen or so Boy Scout troops. In terms of training, the lack of communication between upper and lower commands, and the dispersion of spirit are undeniable facts. It is hoped that the next council will work harder. Du Gang, representative of the City Education Bureau, said in his speech that today's meeting's mission is the end of the old and the beginning of the new. Although the old council has completed its task, the work of the Boy Scouts should continue uninterrupted. Therefore, the selection of personnel should be carefully considered, and those who can take on the responsibility of promoting the work must be appointed as directors.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: At the end, the election began. Election officials were designated by the presidium. The election results were: Wu Chuliang, 61 votes; Zhu Jiarang, 59 votes; Leng Xueqiao, 50 votes; Wang Gang, 48 votes; Qu Yue, 47 votes. The above five people were elected as directors. Zhao Weizu, 46 votes; Gong Jingyuan, 44 votes; Chen Zhizhen, 44 votes. The above three people were elected as alternate directors. Tong Hangbai of the City Party Headquarters and Director Pan of the City Education Bureau are still ex officio directors.</p>

<p>He Painstakingly Managed the Lida Academy</p>
<p>Achieved Remarkable Results in Implementing Production Education</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang Husheng, the founder of Lida Academy, served in middle schools in Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces after graduating from Beijing Advanced Normal School in 1919. In 1925, he gathered comrades to found Lida Academy in Shanghai. For the past eight or nine years, he has painstakingly managed it and spared no effort. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, the academy was tragically destroyed by the Japanese invaders. Mr. Kuang and his comrades worked hard to restore it, and they were exhausted physically and mentally. He was diagnosed with intestinal cancer and admitted to Tongren Hospital at the end of December last year. After several treatments, there was no improvement. In March of this year, he was transferred to Southeast Hospital, but his illness was already serious and the doctors could do nothing. He passed away at 7:15 AM yesterday (22nd). Mr. Kuang has been keen to promote production education in recent years and has achieved remarkable results, which is worthy of emulation by the educational community. Unfortunately, he passed away in middle age, which is a great loss to the educational community. It is also heard that all the teachers and students of Lida Academy have decided to bury Mr. Kuang in the academy's farm as a permanent memorial.</p>

<h3 id="e201">High-Pitched Tone <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>When I was young, I read the "Strategies of the States," which listed the four conditions for the demise of a country as cited by Duke Gong of Lu: (Later generations will surely perish their country through wine, through lust, through delicacies, and through the construction of high platforms and pools.) I thought that this could encompass everything. Later, history told me that there was also a significant condition for the demise of a country, which was that later generations would surely perish their country through high-pitched tones. But look, the Jin people's high-pitched tone was in pure conversation, the Song people's high-pitched tone was in Neo-Confucianism, and the Ming people's high-pitched tone was in the eight-legged essays that spoke for the sages; they strived for empty talk that was (to reach the pinnacle) and (unattainable), and unknowingly planted a seed sufficient to perish the country. When the time was right, it blossomed into a flower of national demise and bore a fruit of national demise. This was the result of exclusively singing high-pitched tones. Doing things requires stepping on solid ground. Exclusively singing high-pitched tones is useless; (Governing does not lie in much talk), officials should not sing high-pitched tones. (Those skilled in divination do not speak of divination), academics should not sing high-pitched tones. (Scared actors use more drums, scared people talk more), (braggart doctors have no good medicine), (cats that catch mice don't meow), it can be seen that anything should avoid using high-pitched tones to deceive people. Recently, high-pitched tones have become a trend of the times. Especially after the September 18th Incident, in order to cater to the trend, at the very least, one must shout a few slogans and put up a few posters. This way, one can do more than enough to resist Japan and save the country. (Kill, kill, kill, kill to Tokyo), these kinds of high-pitched tones are probably still ringing in our ears. However, what is the reality? Fight, fight, fight, fight to Beiping!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Wine and Prostitutes <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Wine is a wonderful remedy for dispelling sorrow. No matter how many obstacles are in your heart or how many grievances are in your chest, you only need to get drunk, and all is over. It's such a delightful thing! No wonder Liu Bolun wanted to carry wine and a hoe, with the wish to be buried wherever he died. Even just inviting two or three close friends for a walk along the embankment or a picnic in the countryside, sipping and drinking leisurely at an apricot blossom village inn, is one of life's great pleasures. Therefore, intellectuals and non-intellectuals alike, those who love wine, account for five or six out of ten, which is very common.</p>
<p>There are only a few men in the world like Liu Xiahui who can resist temptation, so the need for sex is the same throughout the ages. However, due to the prevention of etiquette and the drawing of boundaries, people feel loneliness and dissatisfaction everywhere. Therefore, there are prostitutes who are like common wives to adjust the lonely atmosphere and supplement unsatisfied sexual desires. Moreover, with their jade-like smiles and fragrant perfumes, charming manners and smoky gazes, before anything real happens, souls are already captivated. It is no wonder that bridle tethers are tied under the Spanish cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>Everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages. Wine can disrupt the mind, especially when Europeans and Americans drink excessively and cause accidents. I don't know how many happen every day. Prostitutes in society have various harms such as spreading licentiousness and breeding viruses. Therefore, the United States prohibits alcohol, and our country prohibits prostitution. Both are very strict. However, since the United States has overproduction and cannot sell goods, the number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, which has become a major problem. The government has no choice but to lift the ban on alcohol. Breweries work day and night, and tens of thousands of unemployed workers in New York, Boston, and Chicago are suddenly employed. Other expansions of the alcohol industry, such as the manufacture of wine bottles, bottle caps, trademarks, and wooden barrels, all require labor. It is estimated that it will benefit hundreds of thousands of unemployed people. After this, the United States can slightly reduce the disturbance of unemployed workers. Since our country banned prostitutes, various domestic businesses have been greatly affected, and the market is depressed beyond description. There is no way to think, so they have also applied to the authorities to lift the ban on prostitutes in order to maintain the market. Alas! Relying on the alcohol industry to relieve unemployed workers and using prostitutes to maintain the commercial market are truly unique and unprecedented strange phenomena in this recession!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Ancient Words, Modern Verification <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Disease Enters Through the Mouth: Now the war in North China has expanded, and the six important passes of the Great Wall have all been lost. The enemy is driving straight in, and Pingjin is becoming more and more critical. If a person does not pay attention to hygiene and is careless about diet, disease will enter through the mouth. If a country does not know hygiene and its daily facilities are not adequate, once it is taken advantage of by the enemy, disease will also enter through the (mouth). The ancient saying is indeed applicable to the external troubles of the Republic of China today, it is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Known to Every Household: People living in cities today are truly happy! All shops and households, in order to satisfy the desires of life, are mostly equipped with wireless radios, and the sound of singing songs can be heard endlessly day and night. This truly corresponds to the ancient saying "Known to every household." But if you savor these four words, it seems to be a picture of peaceful times. What about now? The disaster of national subjugation is imminent, and this kind of happy day, contradictory situation, I don't know if it can last for a long time!</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Frog's Slogan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Waking up in the middle of the night, the croaking of frogs in the four fields is so noisy that it is difficult to fall asleep. It reminded me of a Tang Dynasty poem: (In the season of yellow plums, it rains in every house, everywhere in the grassy pond there are frogs.) It really describes it quite well! Please don't hate the noisy croaking of frogs, you can't hear this kind of natural rhythm in the city. People who live in Shanghai only hear the buzzing of motorcycles when they wake up in the middle of the night; the sound of mahjong tiles from the neighbors. These two sounds are unbearably vulgar. There are also people singing on the street, yelling with their sharp voices; hawkers selling snacks, dryly howling like owls. These two sounds are gloomy and ghostly, and not as natural and rich as the croaking of frogs. I am lucky to live in the countryside, listening to them every night; shouting resist...resist...</p>
<p>When I was young, I read the History of Jin, and I remember that Emperor Hui of Jin asked his ministers: Is the croaking of frogs for public or private? Later generations laughed at his stupidity. But if you ask me now, I dare to answer on behalf of the frogs: Frog croaking is for both public and private. Like shouting slogans, in public, you can gain a good name for patriotism; in private, you can all understand. Don't you see now that no matter what meeting is held or what is done, people are always shouting slogans. Once the slogans are shouted, the matter is considered over. The champion of shouting slogans should be given to this Mr. Frog.</p>
<p>Frogs not only know how to shout slogans, but they are also practitioners of resistance, which is a notch above people. If you don't believe me, please look at a story: (Once upon a time, a king was traveling in a chariot, and there was a frog in the wheel tracks. When it heard the sound of the chariot, it stared with wide eyes and did not flinch at all. The king ordered the chariot to turn around and avoid it. People asked why, and the king said: I respect its courage and dare not offend it.) This story implies that you can only find a way out if you struggle; if you surrender, you will never have a chance to rise again.</p>
<p>We have already learned frogs shouting slogans; how many people are willing to learn from frogs practicing resistance? People are, after all, smarter than frogs!</p>

<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>(Gardenias! Jasmines!......) The charming flower-selling voice of the flower girl spread throughout the long streets; spread throughout the short alleys. From morning to sunset, the footsteps of the flower girl covered the whole city. Less than half of the full basket of flowers was sold, and the remaining flowers were withered and faded.</p>
<p>(Gardenias! Jasmines!) The charming flower-selling voice of the flower girl contained much disappointment and sadness. (How much is a gardenia?) (Fifty cents.) (Flowers! Not as fragrant as you, flowers! Not as white as you.) A frivolous young man used buying a gardenia as an excuse to tease this little flower seller. (I am selling gardenias, why do you say I am white and fragrant?) The flower girl thought like this; but, for fifty cents, she had to endure humiliation and sell the flower to the young man.</p>
<p>In the early morning, before the dew had dried, when others were still sleeping in their fragrant quilts; the flower girl had long been in the flower garden picking flowers to do business today. After dusk, when others had finished touring the suburbs and were heading home; the flower girl looked at the unsold flowers and was sad alone. Selling flowers for money, why was she ridiculed by young men in front of people? Some people advocate women's careers, and some people say that men and women should be equal; but the general society does not think so.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Mourning the Year's End; Title Marks the Day of Resistance, Shouting Grows Loud</p>
<p>Jiang said, "Old Master, this Company Commander Zhao of yours is really..." Just then, Zhao Ziqiang hurriedly ran in again, walked up to Old Zhao, and said in a low voice, "Dad! You can drink a little wine, but not too much. The mutton hotpot is very delicious, but it's not easy to digest, so you have to eat less of that too. Don't stay up all night; keeping watch is just saying the same thing over and over." Old Zhao said, "I know what I'm doing, don't worry about me, go back to your camp. Don't just chat and delay official business." Zhao Ziqiang looked at his father's appearance, which was very sincere, and then he left reassured. Old Zhao picked up two large strings of paper packages, checked them over, and put them away, when he heard Jiang calling outside the door, "We're here! The mutton is here, my daughter and I will cut the meat slices for you first." As he spoke, he pushed open the windbreak and walked in, with Guizhi standing behind him with her head lowered. Old Zhao cupped his hands and said, "My intention was to invite guests, and I meant to ask the two of you to help me out." Jiang smiled and said, "That's no problem, don't we cook at home?" Old Zhao heard this and stopped being humble, leading the mother and daughter to the kitchen to prepare the hotpot. He was, after all, an old man, and he held onto some old customs. He tied a red table skirt in the main room, and on the table he arranged honey offerings and the three sacrificial animals. In front of the table, he spread a lot of sesame stalks, so that people could step on them and "crush the year" as they walked back and forth. The Jiang mother and daughter went in and out, their footsteps rustling on the sesame stalks. Guizhi smiled and said, "Our family hasn't bought this kind of thing to 'crush the year' for six or seven years." Old Zhao smiled and said, "Girl, how would you know? It's your old lady who knows how to manage a household. Originally, these seasonal things are optional. If it weren't for my Ziqiang, who arranged everything so thoroughly, I could have saved myself some trouble." Guizhi said, "Old Master, your Company Commander Zhao is so filial!" Jiang carried in seven or eight plates of mutton slices and laughed, "Since you know to say that, why don't you learn a little from Company Commander Zhao?" Guizhi pursed her lips and smiled, standing to one side. Jiang placed the mutton plates on the table and then busied herself carrying ingredient dishes and the brass hotpot, going in and out non-stop. Old Zhao laughed and said, "Okay, Old Lady, once you've finished cutting, that's enough, let my Little Lin carry them." (51)</p>

<p>(The Future Me)</p>
<p>Happy days pass like flowing water, and lovely spring is about to depart. My hopes will appear before me. What hopes do I have? Let me report them one by one below: I hope to be an aviator in the future, and I am now entering aviation school. But my mom and dad won't let me go because they think aviation is very dangerous. But I don't think so in my heart. I feel that sitting in an airplane and flying in the sky, leisurely and carefree, looking at the azure sky; the fiery red sun, filling my eyes with pleasure, increasing my knowledge, is really not shallow. When the country is in times of difficulty, the plane is loaded with bombs; machine guns, and I will fight a decisive battle with the enemies of power. In the end, that power will fail. Finally, I will fly to their capital, throwing bullets like rain, bombing their houses; separating their heads from their bodies. When I return victoriously, the cheers will shake my eardrums, calling me a hero, wouldn't that be fun? But will I be able to achieve this goal in the future? I hope for it with all my heart!</p>

<p>— Zhou Ling</p>
<p>Spring has come, all kinds of trees are sprouting, and the flowers are blooming luxuriantly. Butterflies and bees are collecting honey in the hearts of the flowers. Coincidentally, a few children came along, and they held a meeting under this tree. One child said: (Flying insects have all come out, and the most beautiful of the flying insects are the butterflies. In a few days, let's go to the wilderness together, take insect nets to catch butterflies, kill them with needles, and put them in boxes to make specimens). Many children agreed.</p>
<p>But these words were heard by the butterfly on the tree. It hurriedly returned to its home and discussed it with its own kind, saying: (Now humans want to harm us. If we don't resist, our species will soon be wiped out by humans. Now we should resist together). One little butterfly said: (We are small and weak, how can we resist the violent humans?) The butterflies were somewhat troubled by this question.</p>
<p>Just when they couldn't think of a solution, suddenly there was a buzzing sound outside, it turned out to be a bee. It collected honey and was on its way back, passing by here, and seeing the worried expressions on their faces, it intentionally called out a few times to attract the butterflies' attention. The butterflies knew it was a bee, so they invited it in and told it everything completely. The bee listened and said: (Butterfly sisters, don't be so worried, when that day comes, I will come to help you). The butterflies were very happy to hear this and sent it to the door. The days passed quickly, and those children all went to the wilderness to catch butterflies, but they didn't catch a single one. Instead, they were stung so painfully by the bees that they returned home dejectedly. The wounds from the bee stings took several days to heal!</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Will of Heaven <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Wearing cotton clothes in April, the weather is really a bit strange. The poem "First Month" says: (In the first month (the month of positive yang), now in April, frost is heavy, my heart is sad.) Strange weather existed in ancient times, we ourselves cannot help but (my heart is sad).</p>
<p>When the Yuan army attacked Hangzhou, they set up tents on the beach of the Qiantang River. The Song people thought that heaven was destroying the Suo barbarians, and that this would solve everything. Who knew that the river tide would not arrive for three days, and the Yuan soldiers attacked Hangzhou. There is a great deal of the will of heaven in this. This year, the wind in Luoyang is particularly strong, making it inconvenient even to practice flying, so it is necessary to lead the team back south to Hangzhou. (See the newspapers of April 21) It is true that the wind makes it inconvenient to practice flying; when children fly kites in the spring, if the wind is too strong, they have to take in the kite to avoid breaking the string. Everyone understands this basic knowledge. The wind is strong in Luoyang, there must be the will of heaven in this! However, the will of heaven is unpredictable. The wind is strong in Luoyang, and our planes have already flown back to Hangzhou; if a Japanese plane tries to fly over, it will be blown down, isn't this the boundless happiness of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Some people, based on Liu Bowen's Shao Bing Song, say: (The Xuantong Emperor will still have thirty-six years of rule.) It can be seen that the fall of Beiping and Tianjin was originally within the will of heaven. The sage Hu told us to wait for fifty years, the sage revealed the secrets of heaven to save all living beings, his grace is limitless. We should quickly lie down in the pit, each person getting a pipe, facing each other under a lamp, so as not to disappoint the good intentions of the sage Hu. If we don't get a pipe, but play golf, dance and drink champagne, and bet on greyhounds and jai alai, that is also a kind of rest, and there is no reason to object. Fifty years later, the will of heaven will turn, we will leap out of the pit, planes will fly out of Hangzhou; the sun will be bright and the wind clear, the pipes will be invincible, the kite strings will never break, and China will be saved.</p>
<p>Therefore, the other side of the will of heaven in the fall of Tianjin is the Eastern Renaissance. The fall of Constantinople led to the westward movement of culture, and the fall of Beiping led to the southward movement of (culture). Haven't you seen that the masters of the Renaissance have already been born! Alas, the principle of prosperity and decline, although it is said to be human affairs, is it not the will of heaven!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Introducing Renard and His "Carrot Top" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Wen</p>
<p>We have only selected Renard's "Carrot Top" from the vast sea of modern literary masterpieces, and there is no other reason, only because it is a long novel that can be taken apart, composed of several short stories, which is easier to edit and easier to read. Although Renard has a considerable position in the history of world literature, it seems that few people in China know about him. Here I must write a few words to introduce him: Renard's name in Western languages is JULES RENARD, born in CHALONS in the M A Y E N N E province of northwestern France in 1864, and died very early, enjoying less than fifty years of life. But in this short life, his literary achievements were already amazing; he was elected as one of the ten members of the famous Goncourt Academy (A C A D E M I E G O N C O U R T).</p>
<p>From 1888, he successively published novels such as "Crime de Village," "Sou rire Spin ces," and "Le Cornifle ur." In 1894, "Poil de Carotte" (Carrot Top) was published, and he became famous immediately. This novel was later adapted into a play, which achieved great success on the stage. "Carrot Top" in France, like Ah Q in China, has become a well-known typical character. "Carrot Top" is a somewhat silly, unfortunate child who grows up in a very bad family and suffers from heavy oppression; a biased mother abuses him; a selfish father always ignores him; and cunning older brothers and sisters also take advantage of the environment to bully him. Living his days in this kind of atmosphere, Carrot Top gradually becomes cunning, lazy, and cruel. There are no particularly surprising plots in this book; Renard gives us a series of consecutive cartoons with skilled brushstrokes. Every character in the picture has undergone accurate observation and careful dissection, and many scams or base places in each person's daily life that are not easily seen are shown on paper. Such cartoons not only give people a sense of emotion, but also allow attentive readers to experience a kind of calm ridicule everywhere. The famous historian Gustave Lanson said that this is an unprecedented masterpiece of originality, which is not an overstatement.</p>
<p>Because in recent years, many of the foreign literary works translated in China are either translated incorrectly or are so difficult to understand, that most readers tend to many easily digestible (creations), and they turn away from Western masterpieces of more value. This magazine intends to publish a few faithful and clear translations within the possible scope, and honestly do some introductory work. The translation of (Carrot Top) can also be said to be our first attempt.</p>

<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>(4) Uncle Jun</p>
<p>Uncle Jun is a distant cousin, I don't see him very often; in my impression, he is such a kind middle-aged man, always stroking my hair, asking me if I have finished reading the Classic of Filial Piety. It was the year I was nine years old that he ran to my house in great despair, talked to my father, and then left, returning to Ningbo. When I went back eight years ago, I saw him, and he still asked if my dad was well, if my mom was well, if my younger brothers and sisters were well, and he bought a lot of food for me. At that time, he was still such an elegant and polite gentleman. Later, every year when people from the countryside came up, I always heard people say that he had sold this and sold that. From people's mouths, I learned that he had already sold his daughter and sold his family's graveyard, and had become a pauper who didn't even have a long coat; from people's mouths, I learned that last winter he slept on straw and almost froze to death there; from people's mouths, I learned that he had only a wife who smoked opium, a son who smoked opium, and his own opium-smoking mouth, a thin shadow. Once, someone mentioned his youngest son, Zhongshou, my cousin: (Zhongshou is very pitiful, neither his mom likes him, nor his dad likes him, every day he goes to the town, takes a broken huqin, sings and plays, asking people for a few coins to make a living. That day, I don't know how he ran to Mu Village, stood in front of Aunt Wuling's house singing ditties and asking for money. As soon as Aunt Wuling saw him, she told him not to play anymore, gave him a yuan, but he didn't even take the money, covered his face and left, and hasn't been seen since, I don't know where he ran off to...) Hearing these words, that kind middle-aged man floated back into my memory, along with a sad face that no longer smiled slightly, asking me if I had finished reading the Classic of Filial Piety. Why? Why would such a good person have such a bad fate? That day, after sweeping the tombs of my great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, I saw him sitting alone in the main room, everyone else was playing cards in the room, ignoring him. They hid everything, not even giving him a teacup or a water pipe, guarding him like a thief. I felt sorry for him, went inside to pour a cup of tea, took a cigarette, and just as I was about to go to him, my aunt pulled me back and said; (Don't go, he has lice on him). But I still went and gave him the cigarette and tea. He smoked the cigarette without saying a word, his head lowered, not daring to look at me. He sat there very awkwardly, his hair was so long that it hung over his shoulders, a pair of eyes like those of a neurasthenic patient, staring at the ground, tucking his feet under the chair. Because he was wearing a pair of heel-less shoes, he was afraid I would see them. Several times he put his arms on the table, and then hurriedly pulled them back, because there was a hole in his arm, and the cuffs were gone. His face was full of sadness, and the flesh had hung down, he was so haggard!</p>
<p>I sat with him until evening, and he only said one sentence: (Shanghai is probably very different from before, right? I haven't been there for more than ten years). He swallowed a sigh.</p>
<p>When it was time for dinner, only I accompanied him, everyone else avoided him, as if afraid of being contaminated by poverty. After only eating half a bowl of rice, he stood up and said he was leaving. I took a lantern and gave it to him, and saw him to the door. He looked at me as if he wanted to say something but couldn't. I understood and slipped a five-yuan bill into his hand. He lowered his head, and I saw two tears slowly hanging down, hanging down. After a long time, he finally said: (Child, heaven will repay you). Then he picked up the lantern and left.</p>
<p>His thin shadow and that dim lantern disappeared together into the fields. (A good person!) I sighed so much.</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(20) Lu Xun (The Stalker of the Tang Dynasty) In Shanghai dialect, young wastrels who follow women, hooking up and teasing, are called "stalkers." Mr. Lu Xun's "Essays from the Three Idlers" has an article called "The Stalker of the Tang Dynasty," citing Zhang Bi's "Tune: Sand of the Washing Stream" tenth poem as an example, translating it into vernacular poetry. He also said that stalking may not have started in the Tang Dynasty. I think that the three poems "East Gate Pond" in the "Airs of Chen" are the oldest stalking poems. The poem says: "The pond at the east gate can soak hemp. That beautiful, virtuous woman, can I sing with her? The pond at the east gate can soak ramie. That beautiful, virtuous woman, can I talk with her? The pond at the east gate can soak rush. That beautiful, virtuous woman, can I speak with her?" If we combine the meaning of the three poems and translate them into one vernacular poem, we will get the following: "In that dirty pond at the east gate, soaking the grass for twisting ropes, soaking the hemp for spinning thread, I think both are possible. You beautiful, modern lady, can I chat with you, and sing with you: (Sister, I love you)?" I don't know what wise readers think, and what Mr. Lu Xun would think if he saw it!</p>

<p>— By Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Chickens</p>
<p>(I can bet,) Mrs. Lepic said, (Olo rine has forgotten to lock up the chickens again.) Really, we can tell from the window. Over there, at the top of that big courtyard, the little henhouse shows the black silhouette of the open door. (Felix, would you like to go lock up the chickens?) Mrs. Lepic said to the oldest of her three children. (I'm not here to take care of the chickens,) Felix said. This was a pale-faced, lazy, and cowardly child. (Then what about you, Ernestine?) (Ah! Me, Mom, I'm afraid!) Felix and Ernestine replied almost without looking up. They were lying on the table, almost forehead to forehead, looking at books with great interest. (Good heavens, how stupid I am!) Mrs. Lepic said. (I didn't think of him. Carrot Top. Go lock up the chickens!) She gave the youngest child this nickname because his hair was brownish and his face was full of freckles. Carrot Top, who was sulking under the table, stood up and murmured: (But, Mom, I'm afraid too.) (What?) Mrs. Lepic shouted, (A child this big is still afraid! That's funny. Go!) (Everyone knows; he's as brave as a he-goat,) his sister Ernestine said. (He's not afraid of anything, not afraid of anyone,) his older brother Felix said. These flattering words made Carrot Top proud, and he thought it would be shameful to fail their praise, and he secretly tried to overcome his cowardice. Seeing him hesitating, his mother said that if he didn't go, she would give him a slap. (Then at least shine a light for me,) he said. Mrs. Lepic shrugged her shoulders, and Felix smiled contemptuously. Only his sister Ernestine felt unbearable and took a candle to send him to the end of the corridor. (I'll wait for you here,) she said. But she immediately ran away in terror. Because a gust of wind shook the candlelight a few times and blew it out. At this point, Carrot Top was stunned and began to tremble in the dark. The night was so dark that he felt blind. A gust of wind blew, wrapping him like a cold blanket, as if to snatch him away. Were foxes, even jackals, not hissing between his fingers and on his cheeks? He knew that the only way at this time was to run towards the henhouse. He buried his head and darted into the darkness, groping, he touched the hook on the henhouse door. The chickens inside the house heard his footsteps and began to cluck in panic. Carrot Top shouted to them: (Don't make noise, it's me!) He closed the door and turned to run away, his legs and arms as if they had grown wings. When he ran back into the house panting and proudly, under the warmth and light, he felt as if he had taken off a heavy, muddy rag and put on a set of light, new clothes. He was smiling, elated, standing up straight, waiting for others' congratulations; and now that he was out of danger, he searched the faces of his family members for traces of the anxiety they had just shown. But his older brother Felix and sister Ernestine were nonchalantly continuing to read their books, while Mrs. Lepic said in her natural tone: (Carrot Top, from now on, you have to lock up the chickens every night!)</p>

<h3 id="e214">Finance Takes a Nose Dive Without Turning Back: Yesterday's Standard Gold Price Dropped Another 10 Yuan <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Fifty-Two Yuan in Half a Day</p>
<p>(Bank of America Fell Back, Opening Reached as High as 975 Yuan. The Rumor of Using Both Gold and Silver Arrived, and the Downturn Was Rampant Again.) The gold market, although only open for half a day yesterday, was turbulent with fluctuations of fifty-two yuan. In the early morning, foreign telegrams indicated that London's large bars, both near and far term, increased by 3.125, while the British-American exchange rate shrank by half a point, British-English fell by 3.5 points, New York silver prices dropped slightly by 1.25 points, far-term silver prices fell slightly by 2.9 li, American cotton had stabilized, and the wool market opened with a rebound and rose to 60 yuan. Bingxing attempted to limit purchases without success, Hengxing bought all goods, Run Changyu, Daxing, Yongyuan, Sheng Yong, and Yongze sold, hovering around 68-69 yuan. When Zhifeng and Yongfu Chang sold, it retreated to within 5 yuan. Afterwards, Yuanmao and Yongdai Bingxing purchased over 400 bars, Yuankangxiang also bought, reaching beyond 70 yuan. Bingxing then came to buy again, and the opening price was 973.5 yuan. Although the exchange market was tight at the start, banks were quite eager to sell, so it gradually declined from 75 yuan. The exchange market remained firm, and foreign telegrams reported that President Roosevelt, in a conversation with senators, seemed to be adding silver clauses to the inflation bill, so the downturn began. Before long, news spread in the market that 4.5 million yuan in silver was being shipped out of the city, and that a large amount was also planned for export. Several levels were broken in succession. However, because President Roosevelt said in a foreign telegram that production might be excessive after raising prices and that new methods would be sought, there was a rebound. In the end, morale was bleak, and it retreated to 23 yuan, closing at 25 yuan, with an additional 38 yuan for smelted red gold. The market situation for the half-day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 973.5 yuan, an increase of 28.5 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 74 yuan, and the opening exchange rates were all tight. The short-term British exchange rate was quoted at 1 shilling 2 pence 4375, 375 tighter than the previous close, and the American exchange rate was 22.875 yuan, 5625 tighter than the previous close. Bingxing continued to buy, raising it to 5 yuan. Yongfeng and Hengyu both sold, breaking the 70 yuan mark. This was because there were rumors from bank private telegrams that it would increase by 0.0625, and morale was unstable. Chunyuan, Yongfu Chang, Daxing Yong sold again, reaching 63.5 yuan, because in August, banks were willing to offer 24 yuan for American dollars. Zhaofeng, Changshun, Lirui Xing came up to buy, reaching 7.5 yuan. In June, banks were willing to sell American dollars for 25, and Chunyuan, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Daxingyong sold, breaking the 60 yuan mark again, reaching around 59 yuan. Hengyu then accepted, pulling up more than 5 yuan. Fuchang sold off, still within 60 yuan. Hengxing also sold, reaching 58.5 yuan. Goods were sold off once, retreating to 6 yuan. Before long, East Asia bought 125 American dollars for August, and Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongda, and Decheng all heard the news and entered the market, reaching 63 yuan. However, because Hengxing limited sales, it turned downwards. HSBC's exchange rate announcement was 125 less for British exchange and 375 less for American exchange. Yuanmaoyong sold on the market, reaching within 60 yuan. Holan came out with 3125 American dollars for May, Yuanshengyong sold to 58 yuan, and Hengxing, Yongfeng, Zhaofeng Chang scrambled to sell, reaching 2 yuan. Chunyuan Yong, Tianfeng Yong came to buy, rebounding 4 yuan. Fuyu sold off, again for 1 yuan. Yuanshengyong, Zhifengyong, and Richang all bought, again for 5 yuan. Citibank placed 1875 American dollars for August, and Yuanmaoyong still came to sell. Richang Zhifengyong suddenly sold off here, breaking the 50 yuan mark. Pan Gen even placed 25 American dollars for August. The sellers were excited and then retreated to 46.5 yuan. Qianchangxiang and Zhifengyong slightly accepted, reaching around 50 yuan. Mitsui seized 4 yuan for July, and Hengtai, Richang, Hengyu, Shunli all entered, reaching beyond 54 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Yuanshengyong, and Shenkang then sold. Banks placed 0.0625 American dollars for July, still retreating to within 50 yuan. When 125 of the same month were difficult to sell, Hengyu slightly sold, falling to 6 yuan. Yuanheng Daxingyong took advantage of the low price to accept, once reaching 51 yuan. Mitsui came out with 375 American dollars for August, Qianchangxiang sold to 45 yuan, and Fuchang entered to 9 yuan. After entering, foreign telegram news was unfavorable, and news of a large amount of silver being exported from the city spread in the market. Yifeng Yong, Hongli, Zhifengyong scrambled to sell, breaking the 40 yuan mark again. Dadecheng also came to sell. Zhifengyong sold fiercely again and again, and the momentum was extremely fierce, breaking the 30 yuan mark in an instant. A selling wind spread throughout the market. Yuanmaoyong and Daxingyong took the opportunity to sell fiercely, plunging to 25 yuan, and the storm subsided. Citibank bought 625 American dollars for the current month, and Fuchang entered the market, gradually improving, once returning to 34 yuan. However, because of the panic, Bingxing sold slightly, still retreating to within 30 yuan. 0.5 yuan of American dollars for July were difficult to sell. Zhifengyong continued to sell, and the lowest price dropped to 23 yuan. After maneuvering, the noon closing was 925 yuan. After the close, Chunyuan Yong entered the market, and it was expected to trend upwards. Because Daxing Yonghengxing entered the market, it rose to beyond 30 yuan. Goods were first auctioned at 26.5 yuan at the close. The highest price for the half-day was 975 yuan, and the lowest price was 923 yuan, with a fluctuation of 52 yuan. In the end, it still fell by 20 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was because HSBC's listed American exchange rate was 375 less, at 2.625 yuan. The alloy price was over 1060 yuan. In terms of the closing price, approximately 135 yuan were pressed, more than 37 yuan more than the previous close. The registration for this month was 945 yuan, 939 yuan for May, 925 yuan for June, the water replenishment price was 945 yuan, and the public bills (April) released were 140 bills by Yifeng Yong, 112 bills by Yingfeng Heng, 91 bills by Qianchangxiang, 8 bills by Dafeng Heng, and 14 bills by Dashun. The collected bills totaled 280 bills by Tongfeng Heng, 63 bills by Run Changyu, and 42 bills by Run Changyong, for a total of 385 bills collected and released. Smelted red gold and swaps were lacking in transactions, which was due to the low term standard price, so the source was cut off. The estimated additional cost for smelted red gold at the initial opening was about 40 yuan. After entering, only the Hankou gang (Shencheng) slightly sold dozens of taels, which were collected by Yingfeng Heng, with an additional 38 yuan. The market was boring, and the trend for spot goods was like this, so there was a lack of long positions in swaps. The premium was generally more expensive than the previous day. 1169 bills from April remained. The long positions were Tongfeng Heng, Run Changyu, and Run Changyong, while the short positions were Qianchangxiang, Yifeng Yong, Dafeng Heng, and Yingfeng Heng. There were a total of 11,480 bills in May. Qianchangxiang alone had more than 10,000. The short positions were Tongfeng Heng, Qingfa Yong, Ruixing, and Yuanmaoyong. Transactions within the factory were extremely eager on the selling side, but with very few buyers, the transactions were also limited. In summary, Bingxing, Richang, Shunli, Wanxing, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Tianfengyong, Hengtai, Daxingyong, Yuanheng, and Ruixing were on the buying side. Run Changyu, Yongfeng, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanshengyong, Shenkang, Hongli, Zhifeng Shui, Yifeng Yong, Qingfa Yong, and Xianghe were all sellers. Hengyu, Hengxing, and Chunyuan Yong Fuchang first sold and then bought. Fuyu, Dadecheng, and Bingxing first bought and then sold. The most bills for June were still held by the Dalian gang, Wanxing Shunli, with more than 7,000 bills in total. The Guangdong gang Hengxing also had more than 1,000 bills. Yuanheng, Tongfeng Heng, Run Changyu, Run Changyong, Dadecheng, etc., also had a large number of bills. Qianchangxiang was short more than 10,000, Dayu and Yongruixing Bingxing were also short more than 1,000. In total, there were 23,296 bills.</p>

<p>(Weekend Closings Show a Slight Decrease; Jiangnan Small Coins Rise Sharply, Copper Coins Also Increase)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the banks did not accept various later closings due to the Saturday holiday, so the amount of closings that day was less than usual. The market price for foreign interest in the market remained unchanged, still at 2%, the same in the morning and afternoon. The water added to the cut-head also rose, calculated at 2 jiao 2-3 fen. There were over 700,000 foreign mortgage transactions, 300,000 outgoing from customer accounts, and 1.8-1.9 million in banknote inflows and outflows.

<p>Long and Short Positions Slightly Compete, Market Prices Rise and Fall Suddenly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly chaotic. Regarding the situation in Pingjin, although the authorities repeatedly declared that it could be guaranteed to be safe, the enemy's intention to occupy it had not stopped, and people could not help but feel uncertain. Moreover, the market's appetite for investment was slightly sluggish, so it could not continue to rise. However, there were still a small number of long and short positions competing with each other, so the market prices still rose and fell suddenly. Saturday trading has always been quiet, so the market prices often did not change much. The initial auction in the morning was slightly higher by two or three jiao, and it gradually weakened from the 19-year term onwards. Although there were no large players entering and exiting, there were more retail investors offering to sell, and the market prices fell by three or four jiao as a result. Morale was therefore depressed. In the second round, as a result of unanimous selling, market prices continued to fall by about three to five jiao. The 19-year term fell sharply by eight jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the northern gang had some demand, and it rebounded slightly by one or two jiao to three or four jiao. The unified salt tax was slightly weak, and the term salt tax also rose by one jiao. The market was quite uncertain. The closing transaction volume decreased sharply, and the market prices also saw both ups and downs. Later, for the unified tax term, the northern gang had more purchase volume, which led to a rebound in the salt tax of two and a half jiao to three and a half jiao. It was uncertain and confusing, and there was no consensus. As a result, the market prices slightly rebounded by one or two jiao to six or seven jiao. Among them, the largest drop was the 19-year aftermath this month, which fell by seven jiao. However, the 18-year term for this month rose by five and a half jiao, and the demobilization and salt tax rose by one jiao or five fen. The total transaction volume was 9,400,002 yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot goods. The term salt tax alone accounted for 2 million, the demobilization tax for over 1.8 million, the unified tax for 1.67 million, the 19-year term for 1 million, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 7-800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e219">New York Stock Market Hovers <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Friday (21st), the New York stock market was still strong in the morning. However, due to excessive selling of American dollars, there was a technical reaction, and stocks, grains, goods, and silver all fell back. Those who were generally bullish were greatly disappointed. According to the opinions of observers, the rebound of the American dollar was because the British government used exchange balance funds to manipulate it. However, this statement is difficult to verify. Silver fell the most, about three points (maximum limit). Large bar silver closed at 3.425 yuan. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 5.21 million. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left. The closing price compared to the previous day: 30 industrial stocks 69.78, down 2.49; 20 railroad stocks 29.51, up 0.76; 20 utility stocks 22.64, down 1.98; 40 bonds 74.10, up 0.57.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Yarn and Cotton: Southern Yarn Sales Expand <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm because the southern market's 10-count coarse yarn transactions are developing, with 2,000 bales. In addition, factories have slightly purchased on previous days, resulting in a dry market surface, tight sentiment, and a more intense buying wind. General retail short positions are covering. However, the situation in the overseas cotton industry remains pessimistic, but currently, there are large players absorbing, making it difficult to trend downwards. The fundamental problem still lies in actual demand.</p>
<p>(People's Standard: Large Players Buying In) The opening of the People's Standard Market was tight, because there were large players buying. It was auctioned to two or three rounds and then suddenly fell by more than one yuan, but then rebounded by more than one yuan. There were large players buying in, and each month increased by 1.2.3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were good, and each month increased by 7.9 jiao to 1.3.4.5 jiao. The total transaction statistics for the day were 48,600 bales. A check revealed that 2,000 bales were sold by Jifeng, 2,450 bales by Changfeng, 1,150 bales by Yiyu, 1,850 bales by Dachang, and 900 bales by Xincheng. 3,100 bales were bought by Xiesheng, 2,250 bales by Lichang, 2,050 bales by Taichang, 1,850 bales by Yichang, and 1,300 bales by Renfeng. The closing price is as follows. The People's Standard Closing Price Changes and Balances: July 1915 up 135 6,400 April 1861 up 61 7,200 August 1935 103 9,050 May 1885 840 0,000 September 1945 933,550 June 1900 1449,500 Total 235,750</p>
<p>(Spot Yarn Trading Opened in Large Quantities) Spot yarn sales were more active. A check revealed that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,800 bales. Yesterday, there were 1,200 bales, and the market increased by more than one yuan. The amounts bought by each gang are as follows: Yunnan 1,900 Changsha 60 Fujian 20 Fellow Traders 205 Ningbo 20 Guangdong 425 Sichuan 90 Shantou 160 Mainland 132</p>
<h3 id="e221">Cotton is Carried Up by Yarn <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose slightly because the yarn market turned upward, which boosted morale. However, the gold price fell sharply, and the uptrend in foreign cotton also stabilized, so a portion continued to sell. The spot cotton demand in the market remains sluggish. Factories have implemented reduced labor, and consumption has naturally decreased, but general long positions are still not releasing. Judging from the situation of foreign cotton, it is difficult to rise.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Rose 2-3 Jiao) The opening of the Zheng Standard Market saw flat foreign cotton and depressed sentiment. Each month fell by 2-3 jiao. The third round rose by 3 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was expected to rebound, and the market situation was uneven. It first rose due to mass purchases and then softened due to the downturn in Wall Street. The estimated futures increased by 1-5 pounds sound, and spot goods increased by 5 pounds sound. British cotton futures increased by 6-7 points, and spot goods increased by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods increased by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was stable. Japanese and European exporters slightly bought.

<h3 id="e224">Continuous Rain and Unusual Cold Affect Spring Silkworms <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Changan Changan was originally a famous silkworm area, but because silkworm farming has repeatedly failed in recent years, farmers and silkworm breeders are disheartened. This year, due to economic constraints, farmers lack the funds to purchase seeds, and the amount of feeding has sharply reduced. The silkworm seeds are mixed, with local (i.e., self-retained local seeds) and foreign (i.e., improved seeds from various seed breeding farms) each accounting for half. Since the silkworm ants were collected, there have been continuous rains for many days, and the weather has been unusually cold, resulting in unhealthy development of the silkworm ants. Although local silkworms have already gone through three sleeps, silkworm diseases are rampant. In the Yangjiadu Xuhangzhen area, most silkworm ants spit out black and yellow. In the Yuanhuazhen Jinshidun area, foreign silkworms have also developed slowly. The large groups have just completed their second sleep. Occasionally, some are stiff and cannot wake up. Silkworm breeders are generally pessimistic.</p>
<p>Pingyao Yuhang Pingyao and other areas used to be the most prosperous in silkworm farming. This year, due to economic stagnation, they are unable to purchase improved seeds and have risen up in opposition, resulting in riots. Therefore, those who have hatched local seeds this year (i.e., Yuhang seeds) have experienced continuous cloudy and rainy weather since the leaves opened, and the climate has been abnormal, resulting in uneven silkworm sleeps. The early groups have already gone through three sleeps, but most are stiff and cannot wake up due to the cold weather. Occasionally, some have silkworm diseases due to eating wet leaves. This disease spreads rapidly in the northwest countryside. Although the foreign silkworms in the southeast countryside are developing slowly, their shape is still good.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 30-40 sources, and the remaining ones were all slack. In addition, the sources were surging, and the situation was quiet. The market was slightly affected. The market price for Jiangsu Tongbang Qingjiao Songjiang and Nangang Xilian Sifeng and other rice fell by 1-2 jiao. It is estimated that the Bao customers took six boats of light rice from the dock, with a total of about 800. They were inquired about by the Nanyang Quanzhou gang and the Northern Qingdao gang, but they were unable to leave the border. There were rumors that foreign ships were lacking, and the weather was gradually getting hot. The customers all felt that the seasonal period was about to pass and successively stopped operations. Their minds were thus discouraged. However, when considering the selling side, although the bottom price had depreciated greatly, they were unable to raise their appetite for a while, but they were unwilling to make it even smaller. Therefore, by weighing these two sides, the farmer's capital was bound to be unaffected, and there was no risk of a sharp fall. Changbang's rice sales were even. The prices were the same. The yin changed the yuan, and the supply and demand matched each other. The market lacked glory or humiliation. The price of Duyangjian followed the decline due to the slack appetite. (North of Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived from various Hexia gangs. Bai Gengdian's appetite was sluggish, and the market was tired and falling. Although the early light rice arrival was not strong, the retail appetite was not converted, and the price also declined. Few Dujian arrived and sold evenly, and the price was slightly soft. Yangjian's goods continued to arrive, and the sales were still acceptable, with a small number of yuan. Bujian was slightly smaller. The arrival of Yin Yuan was lacking. The source of Bai Yuan was seen to be strong, and the demand was normal. The price was tired and falling.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Term Flour Suddenly Plunged by Over 3 Fen <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed a trend of initially being flat and then weakening. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat had fallen back by about 1-45 jiao, the sentiment was already flat at the beginning. Moreover, due to the sharp fall in gold prices for two days, people's minds were inevitably shifting. However, the factories' dumping of goods was not smooth, so although the market was not good, the degree of decline was not very large. Until the afternoon opening, the long-term market actually showed a downward trend, because the exchange rate increased greatly, and the dumping of spot foreign wheat was inevitable. It was rumored that there had been a transaction of Argentine wheat, priced at only 4.5 yuan. Therefore, large and small factories dumped unanimously, and the customer gangs also returned to sell, so the long-term market showed a sharp drop. Looking at the subsequent steps, if the sales of foreign wheat continue, it will still be difficult to be optimistic. As a result, this month fell by one point compared to the previous day, May fell by 1.5 fen, June fell by 2.25 fen, July fell by 2.7 fen, August fell by 3.2 fen, and September fell by 3 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed a trend of weakening near the delivery date. Due to the proximity of the delivery date for this month, buying and selling were relatively stable. However, due to the decline in the gold market and the surge in the exchange rate in the forward market, the sale of spot wheat became inevitable. Consequently, most speculative long positions could no longer be held and were being unwound. It was also heard that traders were hedging their positions, leading to a gradual drop in prices across all months. Given this situation, the future outlook remains uncertain. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, May and June had no comparative prices, July fell by seven points, August fell by six points, and September fell by five points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sales of imported rice were very brisk. The small shipments of "small twist" rice that recently arrived in Shanghai from Hankou have already been cleared. Yesterday, another 190 bags were opened for sale at a price of $7.45. Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co. also reduced the price and sold 1,500 bags at a price of $7.45. The price was lower than at the beginning of the month, but higher than the price of goods returned from Hankou, mainly due to the active domestic sales and the quick clearance of the cheap returned goods from Hankou. In addition to dealing with imported rice, local merchants also procured over 200 bags of late-season rice from Jiangxi. The Quanzhou traders also modestly handled over 200 bags of late-season rice from Jiangxi. The Fuzhou traders were the most eager, procuring 1,000 bags of late-season rice from Jiangxi, and 700-800 bags each of Hunan machine-milled and coarse rice, and 140 bags of Jingxian rice. Prices were up several points compared to the previous day, especially machine-milled red rice, which was in high demand.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Further Discussion on the Root Cause of China's Ills (Part 2) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>We believe that there are two reasons for the unique maladies of China today: (1) the bankruptcy of various systems that maintain national consciousness; and (2) the gradual disappearance of the culture that sustains national independence. The institutional aspects were discussed in the previous issue, and now we will discuss the cultural aspects.</p>
<p>What is culture? We should first define it: The word "culture" in Western languages is CULTURE. It encompasses a nation's social customs, living habits, religious beliefs, written language, poetry, art, and so on. Not long ago, Mr. George Bernard Shaw, in a conversation with those welcoming him in Shanghai, also discussed the shortcomings of Chinese culture, even stating that China and the East have hardly any culture to speak of. He said: "Culture, according to a scientific explanation, is anything human behavior can do to increase human happiness, especially in the control of nature. In China, one can find very little culture except in the countryside. Today, China is taking from Western Europe much so-called culture that has already lost its effectiveness and harms the public." The great expression of a nation is the expression of its cultural power. For example, before the Meiji Restoration, Japan's nation also went through a period of internal and external danger, but it was able to rise up in time, with the people working together to save themselves, and Japan was able to undergo a complete restoration. Japan was restored, but its original Bushido spirit remained intact. We say that this was originally a legacy of ancient customs in China, but this kind of atmosphere representing ancient culture is gradually disappearing in China, while Japan has been able to promote this spirit into various undertakings that promote national progress. How is this possible? On the one hand, it is due to the support of the people for this custom, and on the other hand, it is due to the tireless promotion of cultural movements throughout history, directly and indirectly promoting and developing this spirit in novels, poems, and paintings.</p>
<p>In addition, in Soviet Russia, which practices communism, it opposes religion on the one hand, and overthrows many popular customs left over from the old system. On the other hand, it preserves all buildings of artistic value, and at the same time vigorously promotes various literary and artistic works related to civilians and workers. The government even established a special cultural committee to be responsible for research and promotion. The degree of importance attached to it is no less than that of other national defense and economic construction. We know that the organization of the Soviet Russian Communist Party is very strict, and the organization of the Red Army is also very well-trained. In terms of political power, it can be said that it is very strong, so there is no need to be afraid of anything. But why do they still pay so much attention to the promotion of art and literature? That is because all the political work of the Party can only see the superficial effects, but cannot deeply affect the hearts of the people, while literary and artistic works such as novels and poems have the function of subtle influence. A social system must have the latent power of culture to stand for a long time, otherwise it has no foundation.</p>
<p>The ability of a great nation with an ancient culture to continue its national life depends on whether it can maintain and develop its original cultural spirit. Now let's reflect on ourselves. What is our emerging culture? What can we be proud of, what is still bright and shining, and what represents our ancient culture of the Chinese nation today? Searching for some ancient culture from the political system, the system itself has gone bankrupt, and what political morality and integrity have long disappeared with the spirit of the system; seeking some culture from within the scope of education, the way of the gentleman left over from the autocratic system and the dignity between teachers and students have long been shattered; seeking some from the family system, the foundation of our social organization, the demise of the spirit of the family system did not begin today, and its collapse has been obvious for the past thirty years. Finally, let's try to find it in Mr. Shaw's so-called countryside and see what happens. We know that since the influx of foreign capitalism using machine production methods into China like a tide, the ancient production methods of rural culture that we have left behind for two or three thousand years have quickly disappeared and bankrupted. Especially in the past ten years, the degree of collapse has expanded day by day. In the next three to five years, it may enter the realm of complete bankruptcy, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>There is a relationship of mutual use and mutual transformation between systems and culture. Under a chaotic system that has lost the faith of the people, it is not easy for a new culture to be produced. At the same time, in the process of the gradual disappearance of the original culture, even if there are leaders with strong wills like Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in France, I am afraid that they cannot be sure of establishing a disciplined system. Because the establishment of a new system still needs to be based on the old system and the original culture. The bankruptcy and disappearance of the old system and culture make the production of new systems and new cultures lose their basis. As for how to save this crisis, it is not within the scope of this article to discuss, but it can be predicted that the whole country uniting and fighting to the death to seek survival is more hopeful than the current method of living in peace and waiting for death.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Skimming the Fat <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Qilian</p>
<p>They are not said to be working, but they are also selling their labor to the capitalists; if you say they are working, they are not like ordinary workers who work hard with their hands and feet. They wear uniforms provided by the company and carry white cloth bags full of copper coins on their shoulders. The weight does not seem to be heavy, but bearing it on their shoulders for eight hours without leaving their shoulders cannot be done without long-term training. This is the occupation (ticket seller) that is generally considered to be very profitable by the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tram Ticket Sellers</p>
<p>In order to understand their actual living conditions, I specially went to find my friend who sells tickets one day; he told me many real situations that outsiders do not know. He said: "Looking at our industry on the surface, there is no other occupation that can compare with it; the income is high, the job does not have to be restricted by anyone, and the time is only eight hours, which is the same as working in an office. But there are unspeakable hardships in it, but no one can understand them. Passengers only know that ticket sellers make a lot of money by 'skimming the fat,' but they don't know that we are taking the price of taking a gamble with our occupation..."</p>
<p>"...Then why do you neglect your duties to take this undeserved profit?" I interrupted him.</p>
<p>"Yes! What you said is not bad, but we seem to have regarded 'skimming the fat' as a sideline. We know that doing this will break our own jobs, but we don't consider this point. What becomes a problem is whether there are passengers." He was probably excited to speak, took off his uniform and threw it aside, and continued: "Foreigners are cunning, but Chinese people are not stupid; the ticket sellers in the past were flexible in their 'skimming the fat,' and the later ones were even more inflexible."</p>
<p>"Then your 'sideline' can now be done more frankly? I am afraid that you can't earn more than a hundred dollars a month?" I thought I guessed correctly when I saw him looking so proud.</p>
<p>"Hum! More than a hundred dollars! Where did such a convenient thing come from in this world? Our wages are twenty-three dollars a month, which is just a nice cover. In fact, if you can take three or five dollars back every month, you are considered to have good skills. Unless you don't do a 'sideline,' otherwise, the fine notices posted in the office are unknown to everyone. Some new ticket sellers, of course, do not dare to do the act of 'skimming the fat' in the first few days on the bus; don't say 'skimming the fat,' they haven't even figured out the threshold of selling tickets. When they go to the company to pay the bill, either the tickets are sold wrong or the copper coins are short. But the company will never forgive these because you are a novice. Really, this kind of 'skimming the fat' sideline has now simply formed a traditional and universal idea in the company. Sometimes if you are not careful and sell the wrong tickets, or because the passengers</p>

<p>— Proposed by Councilor Yong</p>
<p>I believe that people who go to the three major companies in Shanghai to join in the fun are definitely not all going to buy things. Most of them must be going for entertainment, especially me. When I run in, I first have to trade a copper coin to stand on the scale. There are really a lot of people like me! You must have tried it too.</p>
<p>However, the weight records obtained in this way are not always accurate, because the amount and thickness of clothes on the body are uncertain, and the difference between summer and winter is too big after all. I think if there is a scale in the bathhouse, then after washing the dirt off the body, you can weigh yourself naked, and wouldn't the records obtained be the most accurate? Setting up a scale in the bathhouse is not only the most complete and modern equipment, but also the business will be as prosperous as the three major companies! Smart bosses, look!</p>

<h3 id="e233">The Terror of Unemployment <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxian</p>
<p>I went out to work in a hurry today. The food, clothing, housing, and transportation of a family of old and young are finally taken care of by the boss and have been settled. But then I think, what if I suddenly break my job tomorrow?</p>
<p>Eating other people's food and losing your job is as plain as a few thunderbolts in June and a snowstorm in December. It is not qualified to be compared with the news of "(one birth, three children)" and "(the dead resurrected)." Because the boss is to us clerks as we are to a cat or a dog. We have the right to stop supplying food to cats and dogs, and the boss, of course, also has the freedom to stop business with the clerks.</p>
<p>We clerks don't want to think about it, and that's fine. We sleep until dawn, and don't even have a nightmare. If it is unexpected and the mood strikes, we think of the terror after unemployment, and we can't even eat, and we can't even get out of bed. As soon as we put our heads on the pillow, we dream of our wives and children, crying for hunger and cold. Letters of debt collection, court summons, and rice store bills pour in like snowflakes. When we wake up in shock, the beating of the heart seems to break through the chest.</p>
<p>The opportunity for unemployment is lurking around us. A disagreement with customers, offending the parents of food and clothing, or bumping into Mr. A Da with a few words, I'm sorry, please pack up your luggage and find another high position. Military band, ..., ..., ..., spring big price cut, summer big bargain sale, plus ten-week anniversary, special low price, oh no, narrowing the scope, laying off staff and reducing politics, small numbers cannot accommodate large scale, so we have to find another place. Even if we rely on the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in heaven, plus the accumulation of virtue of our ancestors, our jobs are not broken in the big contraction, and we still live the life of small profits but quick turnover, 365 days a year of big price cuts. In the end, the boss has no intention of continuing to make profits. At that time, there is no way to go, and we are not afraid of not getting kicked in the ass. Sometimes, it's still fine the night before, but before dawn, "cock-a-doodle-doo," "boom," "boom," the war begins. After half a year or five months, the ceasefire agreement is signed. The boss's decades-old store, which he has worked so hard to run, has been turned into ashes. What else is there to say? Even if the world is peaceful and the market is maintained by some patriotic people, we are still unlucky. We get a cold, then a headache, then fever and chills. Zhang Long is dead, and we can't afford to hire a fashionable doctor. We lie straight on the bed and hold on. We sweat profusely every day, three bodies of small sweat. Even if we are lucky enough to get rid of the fever and chills, we have already been sick for ten and a half days. After getting out of bed, some people are as thin as firewood, and some people have no energy. At this time, the boss sends a letter saying that he will be temporarily laid off and rehired after recovery. In fact, the so-called "temporary" is just a front. To open the skylight and speak frankly, it is "(we don't want you, you sick ghost.)" But if you don't even fart, sometimes you can't even imagine losing your job. For example, the boss has just taken in a new favorite, and he will inevitably bring a group of brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, or old friends of Mr. A Da. If they lose their jobs and have nowhere to settle down, they will all have to covet your job. These big shots (job enemies) are impossible to resist. All of these things will make you think about it and make you uneasy. As for the words "guarantee," don't even think about it, and don't dare to think about it!</p>
<p>crowded, the ticket is forgotten to be sold; the ticket inspector will impartially seize your evidence (?) and report to the company, and his duty for the day is considered to be completed. The company does not care about these rights and wrongs, and generally accuses you of "(skimming the fat)" and the fine is often beyond your expectations." He was no longer as proud as before; he tightened his serious face and sighed softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, the capital always treats employees unkindly; but if you) have never had this habit of (skimming the fat), the company will not (look for bones in an egg); even if you want to find it, I am afraid you can't find it, right?" I seemed to want to comfort him, but I couldn't help but blame him a few words.</p>
<p>"Wrong is wrong, but the environment forces you to do this. And there is a bad rule that encourages you to do it. The driver clearly wants money, the ticket inspector wants to eat black, the dispatcher wants regular rules, and even the people who sweep the car and pry the road have to spend money. In short, the ticket seller is the source of wealth for all kinds of employees. You have to spend money everywhere. Otherwise, you will run into walls everywhere, and everything you do will be inconvenient for you. May I ask, where can these expenses come from? Since there is no furniture to bring out of the house, what other way is there to remedy it besides (skimming the fat)?" He asked with a questioning look, tilting his head, seeming to be eager for me to give him a concrete answer.</p>
<p>"Um, um! But didn't you say that the ticket inspector is impartial? How can he eat black? The dispatcher doesn't need to give regular rules! Are you still afraid that he won't dispatch you to work? I don't think this is necessarily the reason for manipulating you to (skim the fat)." I still insisted on my own opinion and retorted him.</p>
<p>So he said: "I said that the ticket inspector is impartial, is when he checks tickets on the bus; eating black is in his house, and it has to be delivered to his house. If the dispatcher doesn't send regular rules, although he doesn't have the right not to give you a shift, if you ask for sick leave, or are late for a moment due to an accident, that is the opportunity for him to exercise the power of using public office for personal revenge; one shift is three days, not only losing wages, but also being subject to extra fines!"</p>

<p>I hurriedly said, "Yes!" Saying that, I turned around and left. On the way, I said to myself, "Hum! This is a matter of a storm of jealousy. What does it have to do with me! But the environment often wants to control me and use me as an air vent. Then I, as an apprentice, am too bitter!"</p>
<p>When I stepped into my husband's concubine's mansion, the sound of mahjong tiles hitting each other was like a machine gun sweeping. It made me shiver a few times. I saw my husband smoking his cigarette, staring at the mahjong tiles. Next to him was a young woman, she had delicate eyebrows and a charming look, and her red lips were showing beauty. There was a rich fragrance on her body that made people drunk. Of course, this was my second mistress.

<p>— Sen</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the national situation became more and more dangerous. Internally, the corruption of politics reached its peak, and externally, the oppression of imperialism became more and more fierce. After the Sino-Japanese War, China was almost destroyed. At that time, many revolutionaries rose up to spread the revolution, wanting to overthrow the Manchu Qing rule and establish a democratic government in order to seek national liberation. The Manchu Qing government saw that this situation was unfavorable to them, so they stepped up the suppression of revolutionary forces, but they might as well make concessions to imperialism. Their slogan was: "(Rather give it to foreigners than to family slaves)." This means that they would rather lose the country than let you revolutionary people raise your heads! You see, how vicious their hearts are! At that time, there was also a group of slave running dogs who also helped the Manchu Qing government to shout: "(We cannot have a revolution, revolution is enough to destroy the country!)" However, the climax of the revolution could not be stopped after all, and the storm finally swept in. The Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and the Republic was still the Republic!</p>
<p>This kind of example of "(rather give it to foreigners than to family slaves)" is common in history. To give a famous example, in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the French army was defeated and Paris was besieged. At that time, the poorest people in Paris all rose up and joined the army, bravely resisting the enemy, but the ruling bourgeoisie and nobles saw that this vast armed force of the masses was very unfavorable to them. So they did not hesitate to cede land and pay reparations, seeking peace with Prussia, wanting to first reach a compromise with the foreign enemy and then suppress the domestic revolutionary masses. However, the masses opposed the peace, and the government did not hesitate to use violence to suppress them. Many people were massacred. After that, the government troops secretly went to the armory, planning to steal the people's weapons, but they were discovered. The revolutionary sentiment of the people became more and more aroused. The government was afraid of being surrounded by the people, so it quietly moved out of Paris and retreated to Versailles. The citizens of Paris then began to organize a new government, which was the famous Paris Commune. However, this Commune did not impose severe sanctions on the counter-revolutionary Versailles government. The counter-revolutionary government was able to calmly deploy and get the help of the enemy country to attack Paris. As a result, the Paris Commune failed, and more than 30,000 people were killed. This is a very famous event in Western history. There are many other similar cases. In general, every government, when faced with foreign aggression, may initially use the revolutionary forces of the people, but when it sees that the revolutionary forces are rising too much and are unfavorable to itself, it will turn to compromise with the enemy and do everything it can to suppress the revolutionary people in its own country. This has almost become a common practice.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident broke out, what followed the term "non-resistance doctrine" was "jointly facing the national crisis." Whether it was in the east or the west, it was "jointly facing the national crisis." From the mouths of noble people, in articles, and in all newspapers and magazines, we could almost hear and see the four words "jointly facing the national crisis" everywhere. But how to "(jointly)" face it? And who to "(jointly)" face it with? I was always a little confused. So a group of adults and gentlemen gave an explanation, saying that the (whole) people should unite, regardless of class, to "(jointly)" face the national crisis; the so-called regardless of class means that whether he is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary can be united to jointly face the national crisis; to go a step further, to face the national crisis and eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements... then it cannot be called "(jointly)". Therefore, if we want to jointly face the national crisis, we should not eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements... otherwise, our whole people cannot be (organized) and cannot jointly face the national crisis. This sounds very clever. However, can we (jointly) face the national crisis without eliminating the counter-revolutionary elements? Can the counter-revolutionary elements (jointly) face it with us? Friends! Beware of being deceived! You don't need to turn over history, just look at the facts before your eyes!</p>
<p>But the husband frowned and glared, he said bitterly, "(You leaked the news again! Damn thing!)"</p>
<p>I had difficulty defending myself and had to remain silent. "(You go back!)" the husband ordered. I had to repeat the words of the mistress teaching him to go back again. "(You don't listen to me? Can you interfere with me?)" The husband clenched his fist, and a murderous aura rushed out between his dark eyebrows. Ah! This is another terrible, furious face! I trembled and turned around, and staggered on the way back with a disappointed mood.</p>
<p>Ah! My frightened heart is fighting with the biting cold west wind outside! After returning to the store, the mistress did not give me dinner. She said, "(If the husband doesn't come back tonight...)" Looking at her fierce attitude, it seemed that she couldn't wait to bite off a piece of my flesh! It was late at night, and the clock on the wall was already twelve twenty! My master came back, so my dinner problem was finally solved.</p>

<p>— Ge Lang</p>
<p>(That Foreman) (Little Tu’s wife, after arriving in Shanghai, heard that she had not even worked for two years at the yarn factory before being promoted to (That Foreman). Her current wage is more than thirty yuan a month. Little Tu is truly blessed; now he can rely on his wife for food. He also ran to Shanghai the day before yesterday.) The neighbor, Old Wang, smacked his lips in envy to his wife. (Shanghai is indeed different from the countryside; it's easier to earn money. Just think: thirty-odd yuan; a woman working as a maid in the countryside would have to work for a year to earn that!) Aunt Wang, sewing the shoe upper in her hands, nodded in agreement, also expressing her envy!</p>
<p>However, I can swear that Little Tu’s arrival in Shanghai this time definitely did not have the thought of relying on his wife for food, but only wanted to find a better job. Little Tu circled Shanghai for a full two months, but still couldn’t find a job. The twenty-five yuan from selling five stones of grain was used up! Unable to go home, he had no choice but to live under his wife’s eaves, helping with cooking, washing dishes, fetching water... After five o'clock, the sky was still not bright. Little Tu got up, fanned the charcoal stove red, cooked the rice, fetched the water, and then lay beside the pillow, gently waking his wife.</p>
<p>As soon as she got up, she polished her high-heeled leather shoes for five minutes, then washed her face, applied snow cream, looked at herself in the mirror a few times, took a bowl and sipped a few mouthfuls, put on her coat and prepared to go to the factory. (The weather outside is bad; do you need to take an umbrella?) Little Tu said quietly while wiping the table. (Is the person not dead yet? Can’t I bring it to the factory myself?) she said, slammed the door shut with a (bang), and walked away by herself.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Highway Robber <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Meng Hua</p>
<p>Foreman</p>
<p>This day was the end of the month, and our factory was paying wages. I followed my fellow workers to the accounting office to collect my wages and walked out the door, where I ran into that foreman. He blocked me like a highway robber and asked: (How much wage did you collect today?) Suddenly, I was so frightened by his question that I stared blankly, not daring to answer. Seeing that I didn’t respond, he thought I was doing it on purpose and said even more fiercely: (You won’t tell me, huh!) Seeing his fierce eyes, I was really scared out of my wits! Later, I finally stuttered, (Sir…I…I only collected five yuan.) (Do you understand?) He stared at me intently.)</p>
<p>So I had no choice but to untie my handkerchief and hand him two yuan. (I don’t want it! I’ll give you a hard time tomorrow!) He threw the money on the ground, seeming to think it was still too little. (Sir, this is just for you to buy some cigarettes to smoke; it doesn't count as respect.) (Who wants your cigarettes!) Then, Sir…I) I endured the pain and took out another yuan to give him. He finally accepted it. (Alas! More than half a month's worth of blood and sweat, and the price I got for it was actually so cruel, so meager!) On the way home, I kept thinking about this.</p>
<p>Truly! Little Tu's wife's face, from entering the world until now, has indeed had four different appearances in total. The first one everyone hasn't seen, because she hasn't come to Shanghai yet; the second one is what she just showed Little Tu personally; as for the third and fourth, of course the yarn factory must be her background.</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Most Modern Woman <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>(Mr. Xu, I'm here. Is there anything you want me to do today? Hehe.) Little Tu's wife's leather shoes rang (clatter) into the office, she scribbled her signature on the register, walked up to the foreman with a smile, and greeted him respectfully.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>(Keep an eye on them; don't let them be lazy! Remember the names of these people making bad cloth. If they don't listen, just hit them with a stick! You understand the rest in your heart; I don't need to say more.) Foreman Xu instructed, and returned a smile.</p>
<p>Little Tu's wife stepped over the threshold of the weaving room and immediately took off her cloak and coat, revealing a crimson silk gauze cheongsam and shiny long silk stockings. Among the eighty or ninety female workers, she could indeed be considered (a crane standing out in a flock of chickens). Her first words were: (Everyone pay attention; life has been getting worse and worse lately! If this continues, all wages will be withheld; see how you will survive? It's not that my, That Foreman, has a cruel conscience; what can I do if you yourselves are not striving?) When she said this, her face seemed to have an air of (seventy birds). Then she said: (Little Sister Wang, Li Cuie, come over here! You two little pigs are the worst, always interrupting others all day long, not caring about your work! Today torn cloth, tomorrow broken threads, it's all done by you two pigs!) After she said that, she pulled the ears of the two child laborers a few times and ordered them to go back.</p>
<p>The hum of the weaving room's motor roared, and everyone lowered their heads, busying themselves with warping and wefting. As for what Little Tu's wife's fifth face looked like, no one had ever noticed.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Fitness Bow <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiyuan</p>
<p>Neither being too thin nor too fat is a healthy phenomenon, and exercise really has the effect of improving unevenness in body fat. Because body movement is performed by the action of muscles, the more the muscles are used, the stronger and denser their texture becomes, the elasticity increases, and the fibers gradually proliferate. At the same time, it can make fat disappear, so the muscles of people who do not exercise are soft and weak, thus reducing their ability to work, which is also closely related to life.</p>
<p>As for the method of developing muscles, it is best to do strenuous exercise, such as wrestling, jujutsu, and lifting heavy objects. However, wrestling requires considerable comrades; jujutsu requires someone to guide you: iron dumbbells, stone weights, fitness chains, etc. can of course solve everything for those whose finances are not a problem; but for people with limited income and not very generous finances, it is difficult. Therefore, we have to think of a reformed and economical exercise equipment to remedy this regret. I remember that the previous issues of this journal once published an article by Mr. Hui Zun called (Poor Man's Equipment). Although this method is still usable, it costs more than one yuan, which is still a bit uneconomical, and the procedures are troublesome, the method of use is not varied, and installing it on the ceiling is not only unsightly, but also too rigid, so I think it is not a very good method. Now I have made something that can be used as a fitness chain. The method of making it is as follows:</p>
<p>(Materials) Two five-foot-long large bamboo boards (choose those that are elastic and have no cracks), two one-foot-long and two-inch-wide bamboo boards, four screw rings, one foot of thick lead wire, and several feet of rattan bark (hemp rope is also good).</p>
<p>(Manufacturing method) First, smooth the arc of the two five-foot-long bamboo boards on the bamboo white side (the opposite side of the bamboo green) (otherwise they will definitely break), making two bamboo boards that are two inches wide and half an inch thick. Then tie each of the two one-foot-long bamboo boards tightly to the center section of the five-foot-long bamboo board with rattan bark on the bamboo white side. As shown in Figure 1: Then, screw one of the four screw rings firmly at each end of each bamboo board, as shown in Figure 2: Then, use thick lead wire to connect each screw ring to each other, as shown in Figure 3. In this way, it is successful. (Usage) It is similar to a fitness chain and can form various postures, stretching the muscles. Hold the two hand grips (see Figure 3) with both hands and force them apart to both sides. Such as left and right bow stance (see Figure 4), backhand pull, level split, split upwards, lift from bottom to top, pull down from top to bottom, and other various postures. In short, you have to change it according to your own ideas; there is no fixed rule; but the point to note is that you must not specialize in one-sided exercises, which will hinder balanced development.</p>

<p>Now a certain elementary school in Zhabei intends to hire two female teachers for low-grade classes, with about 1400 minutes of weekly classes. Those who live near the North Station are qualified. Those who are willing to apply should provide a detailed resume and send a letter to Mr. Zhang in charge, No. 75 Dongxinmin Road, for collection. Our company now needs a student interested in the new drug industry, qualified with a high school degree and able to endure hardship. Contact Bailing Drug Store at the corner of Sixth Road and Yunnan Road.</p>
<p>According to the above method, the cost is only about half a yuan, which is naturally more economical compared to (Poor Man's Equipment). If you can spend a little more effort to make it more sophisticated, it will be very beautiful. It is also easy to use and does not have to be limited to a fixed place. You can practice indoors or outdoors. Although it cannot increase the weight, it can increase the number of times, which is still the same in comparison. It seems that this thing has not been seen outside, because its function is similar to that of a fitness chain, so it is called (Fitness Bow).</p>

<p>Dear Reporter: There is a friend here who serves in a certain concession police station in a certain port as a junior constable. Recently, the police station there stipulated that each person must have twenty public matters each month, a shorthand for snatching summonses, so they immediately take action when they see vehicles on the road that are slightly in violation. This friend has been muddling along for a long time for the sake of his livelihood, but the accusation of his conscience makes him uneasy. However, if he doesn't do this, he will be in danger of being dismissed if he can't fulfill the public matters. In fact, many constables are often dismissed for not being able to fulfill the public matters. Therefore, he is constantly thinking about how to leave his current job and find a more peaceful job to do. He has entrusted friends, but his friends are only gatekeepers; he has also entrusted me, but the result is that there is no way. He has a wife and three children. He only hopes to get an income of thirty yuan to maintain his family's life. He is willing to work or be a gatekeeper. He has a rudimentary knowledge of writing, but cannot write fluent articles. He is also very strong and can endure hardship. Reporter, please try to write an article to introduce him and let the address be transferred through your publication.

<h3 id="e243">A Class of European and American Unemployment Relief Policies <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Unemployment is the inevitable result of capitalism. In capitalist society, its economic organization is built on the interests of capitalists. Therefore, all hired laborers can only sell their labor power on the condition that it is beneficial to their employer capitalists; otherwise, they must often depend on the convenience of the employer, who can dismiss them at any time, and become unemployed. Because from the employer's point of view, this is necessary to maintain the interests of their industry, so the unemployed can only live their miserable lives. At this time, the state does not guarantee the financial resources for the lives of the unemployed, society has no obligation to support them, and trade unions have no long-term financial resources to support them. It can be said that they have neither a self-defense strategy nor the right to force others to come to their aid, but only to find their own way out.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the phenomenon of unemployment is of course absolutely unfavorable to laborers, but the continuous increase in the number of unemployed is also enough to make society uneasy, disrupt social order, and affect the capitalists' industries, causing them to suffer disadvantages. Therefore, capitalists have to think of various methods to seek remedies in order to avoid this unfavorable phenomenon. But can this kind of remedy be effective? We only need to take a look at their so-called relief policies. Let's take the advanced capitalist countries of Europe and America as examples. In European and American countries, there are different unemployment relief strategies, but they can generally be divided into the following three types: (1) Employment agencies. The operators of employment agencies, in addition to individual for-profit businesses, also include (1) employer groups; (2) labor unions; (3) charitable or public groups; (4) municipal or national agencies. Because the expansion of unemployment is often general, it is not easy to achieve relief unless employment agencies are widely established in various places and a unified agency is established at the same time to connect and manage them. Currently, only the United Kingdom and Germany have this unified system. In France, although there is such a provision in the law, it has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Unemployment insurance. This system was first created in Ghent, Belgium in 1901, and later spread to France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Now, the implementation of Ghent in 1921, the originator, is listed as follows: (1) Municipal unemployment fund, which is for registered trade unions, based on the amount of unemployment benefits paid to their members as a standard, and give a certain subsidy; (2) The amount of the subsidy is limited to two francs per person per day, and must not exceed ten days for the same person; (3) A certificate is submitted by its former employer and employment agency to prove that the unemployment was not due to one's own intention as a condition for granting the subsidy; (4) The trade union first pays the unemployment benefits and subsidies to the unemployed, and then settles once a month and requests the subsidy from the city; (5) Regarding the economics of unemployment insurance, the trade union clarifies this and keeps a special account book to be inspected by the city. In addition, there is also national mandatory unemployment insurance, which is currently only implemented in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Austria.</p>
<p>(3) Restrictions on dismissal. This system began after the war. Its intention is to restrain the crowding out of the unemployed and make it easier for the unemployed to find jobs. For example: (1) Application for dismissal. When the employer intends to dismiss employees due to business closure or reduction, they must first apply to the government; (2) Notice of dismissal, which obliges the employer to give notice in advance for a certain period of time when dismissing an employee, depending on the length of service of the employee; (3) Payment of dismissal allowance, which obliges the employer to pay a certain allowance when dismissing an employee, the amount of which is based on the length of service.</p>
<p>The above is considered the only relief policy in Europe and America. We only need to look at recent years, especially in the current third stage of capitalism, the sharp increase in unemployment in various countries has reached an acute level, and we can know that this relief policy is ineffective. At best, it is a palliative method that can only relieve a certain part of the unemployed temporarily, but cannot fundamentally solve the unemployment problem. Our country of course need not be mentioned; we do not even have this palliative relief policy, but hasn't unemployment become a terrible phenomenon? But is there really no way to save unemployment? Is unemployment destined for laborers? No, definitely not. There is a way to save it, but it is not the kind of relief policy in Europe and America mentioned above, which only relieves it on the surface, but to think about it from the root, that is, to destroy the capitalist economic organization that produces this unemployment, and replace it with an economic organization that is opposite to it. Laborers can only be free from the danger of unemployment in this economic organization, and the unemployment problem can be fundamentally solved from then on.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Greta Garbo Will Not Return to Hollywood <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xian</p>
<p>(Has a Strong Desire to Dedicate Herself to the Stage)</p>
<p>The Swedish strange star Greta Garbo now has two paths to take: one is to continue to engage in the film industry, which means she must return to Hollywood, because only Hollywood can afford the heavy salary, and only Hollywood is willing to pay such high wages. The other path is to give up the life of the screen and engage in stage plays. These two paths cannot be close to each other, so Garbo has already spent a lot of effort in choosing. It is said that she has recently decided to appear on stage. Of course, her choice was not obtained by drawing lots at the City God Temple; she must have her reasons. Let's discuss it briefly now: Greta Garbo has a great ambition. She believes that the world on the screen has been conquered by her. The second world she wants to conquer is the stage. With this ambition, she would rather sacrifice everything. The first is in terms of income. The stage cannot give her even one-tenth of the salary she can get on the screen. But the stage also has other rewards that the screen cannot give.</p>
<p>In movies, the relationship between actors and the audience is indirect. Although Garbo has already gained fame on the screen, she always feels that she has not seen or heard the direct reaction of the audience. So if she can personally step onto the stage, she can see the expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness of thousands of people responding to the stage under the footlights. She can also hear the sounds of their praise and applause. Although she used to try her best to avoid the entanglement of the crowd, now that she has this ambition, she feels that avoiding the crowd is meaningless and cowardly. Therefore, she often goes out and walks around in the capital of Sweden to get used to it. It is said that she is no longer afraid of the crowd.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a very big reason, which is the three words (not convinced). This is a long story. It was probably around 1920 that she graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the capital of Sweden. At that time, general drama playwrights did not pay attention to her dramatic talent. So a group of classmates were hired by various companies after graduation. Only this Garbo was not asked about. This is a matter that she has been ashamed of in her life. Therefore, she now wants to perform on stage to prove the mistake of those drama producers at that time. To put it in Shanghai dialect, she wants to show them some color.</p>
<p>When Garbo had not yet achieved her ambition, there was only one person who looked up to her and knew her talent and her possibilities. They went from being casual acquaintances to becoming very close friends. He changed her name. She used to be called Greta Gustafsson, which was too cumbersome and unpleasant to hear. He named her Greta Garbo. (Garbo) is a kind of candy in Sweden that children like to eat very much. He gave her this name in order to make it easy to remember and sound good. Later, Mr. Stiller's reputation was known to Hollywood, so they sent someone to hire him. But he strangely put forward a condition that if he was to be hired, he must also hire this unknown Ms. Garbo. Hollywood had no choice but to agree to the request. But her salary when she first arrived in Hollywood was only one or two hundred dollars a week, which seemed not worth it. Before this, Garbo had also performed in German film companies, but the cameramen always said that it was difficult to shoot her scenes, because she looked too ugly on camera. When she arrived in Hollywood, the cameraman at first had no way to put this Garbo, who was full of freckles and had a heavy body, on camera. Later, thanks to the hairdressers, tailors, beauticians, makeup artists, and photographers who joined forces to completely transform her before she could be put on camera. When the first film was completed, she had smooth sailing and became a top star in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3 id="e245">Review of (The King of the Jungle) THE KING OF JUNGLE <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The products under the capitalist system are always indispensable for a form of competition with each other. Although it is not necessarily based on the principle of (comparing goods with goods), once there is a certain product that can make money, then you must come up with something similar. This means that at least you can compete with it. This is completely opposite to the socialist system with controlled production.</p>
<p>In terms of film production, this phenomenon is also very clear, especially in American films. If someone makes a film with horse racing as the subject matter, everyone will imitate it, so (horse racing) fills the film market. Similarly, not long ago there was (Tarzan the Ape Man), so now there is also (The King of the Jungle). Of course, the content of these two films is bound to be largely the same.</p>
<p>The above may be what should be pointed out before the article. Now let's turn to the main text.</p>
<p>If we have to make a more strict critique of this film, then the first thing to point out is the distortion of consciousness. We see that the so-called (LION MAN) protagonist KASPA is conquered by both white people and lions, and is played with by civilized people in civilized cities. Later, he finally envies the uncivilized mountains and forests of Africa, cannot leave his wild animal companions, resolutely takes his lover back to the mountains and forests, and resumes that barbaric life. Regarding this point, it is obvious that it wants to restore human beings to the primitive era, at least sympathizing with (humans and lions being together), becoming a kind of regressive and reactionary thing. Moreover, the story itself is also very fantastic. No one can believe that a two- or three-year-old child can actually survive alone from a pile of bones without being harmed by a group of lions, even though he can be friendly with lions when he grows up. As for sympathizing with lions and hating humans, this kind of cynical fantasy can actually occur in the West where material civilization has reached its extreme, which is really astonishing.</p>
<p>It is very clear here that the producers of this film have completely failed to recognize that films should have their educational significance. On the contrary, if they could introduce the primitive life of Africa faithfully and add correct explanations, as well as introduce rare zoological knowledge to the general audience on the screen in a learning and educational way, then this kind of film would have its value.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this film is an anti-scientific work, undoubtedly a myth-like thing. In the United States, which prides itself on scientific civilization, there is actually this phenomenon, although it is relatively small, but we admit that it is a disgrace to mankind. As for the brutal behavior of white people oppressing natives on the screen, it is an exposure of themselves.</p>
<p>But in terms of technique, American film producers often succeed by relying on large capital. For example, the director can use fire and the riot or fighting of wild beasts to make this film a good harvest; but it seems that I don't need to explain it. Also, a swimmer inevitably becoming a tool of capitalist production is also worth our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Review Two <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the simultaneous release of (King of the Jungle) at both the Grand Theater and the Lyceum Theater caused quite a stir. This shows that people's special interest in this kind of hunting film has not diminished in the slightest. In terms of the story, it is quite similar to (Tarzan the Ape Man). It tells the story of a child who went to Africa with a hunting team a long time ago. Later, the entire team was wiped out, and only the child survived. He grew up among lions and was called "Lion" by the natives. Once, a white hunting team set a trap, and (Lion Man) and several lions were all captured. He was sold to an American circus. The Lion Man escaped once and met a young woman. Although they could not communicate verbally, they were in love with each other. The circus owner used the female lead, one scene from the famous European film (Good Earth), a joint production of German and English film companies. It is a grand opera with a wealth of beauty and power. The male lead, Jack Puella, is a rising star in Europe. The film was well received when it premiered in Europe and America. It is said that the film has been shipped to Shanghai and will soon be released in Shanghai. The woman used culture to enlighten the Lion Man, teaching him language and etiquette. Eventually, the woman and the Lion Man got married. Although the Lion Man had been influenced by culture, he longed to return to Africa to live an uncivilized life. So, the couple bought back some of the most docile lions from the circus and went to the lions' den in Africa together.</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, it seems too far-fetched. And the ideological contradictions have been exposed without reservation. According to the story, we humans should not have culture, and civilized life is not as simple and free as the lives of beasts. Then what reason do we have to demand culture? Why oppose the barbaric life of ancient times? And why have a film industry born out of culture?</p>
<p>The loopholes in the performance are more numerous than in (Tarzan the Ape Man) or (Freaks). In terms of directing skills, although he has tried his best to be flexible, his negligence is also undeniable. For example, within a few days, the Lion Man was able to speak fluent English, which is not reasonable. The Lion Man's escape from the circus and the buying back of the lions are completely done in the dark, which is also very vague. Also, the circus fire did not spread slowly; it was as if people were setting fires on all sides. The style is still novel, continuously describing the African lions and tigers and the circus, which is very natural and unprecedented in previous animal films. However, from beginning to end, there are only large groups of lions and a lack of other wild animals. There are also very few circus performances, which ultimately feels like a flaw.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this type of film is the location shooting. Its grandeur of location shooting is unmatched by other films. The photography is also good, and the clever angles of the camera make the sunlight beautiful. The editing is also seamless, constantly making people feel nervous. The beginning depicts the child's survival, and then the Lion Man, unlike the sudden appearance of the ape-man in (Tarzan the Ape Man). The first few scenes and the fire scene are the highlights of this film. Apart from the lack of awareness, the overall structure is not very far-fetched.</p>
<p>The protagonist, the Lion Man, is swimmer Buster Crabbe's debut on the screen, and the performance is good. The first half is excellent, but the second half is too gentle, which is not very consistent with the wildness that has not been eliminated in the play. This should be blamed on the director. The female lead, Frances Dee, has the best expressions in the whole play, and the kind of lingering affection is really something that only an experienced performer can do. The rest, only Robert Barrron, Nie Xosby, and Patricia Farley have brief but good performances. This film is very suitable for those who (watch movies for the sake of watching movies). It has good art to appreciate, and it has a pleasant performance story that makes people happy... If you are satisfied with (Tarzan the Ape Man), then I dare to recommend you to go.</p>
<p>Paramount has succeeded, but I think this film will disappoint some people who have too high expectations.</p>

<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>In this bustling area of Hollywood, divorce and marriage are a big fuss. Therefore, the three necessities of life, clothing, food, and shelter, have also become various patterns, providing good materials for newspaper reporters in magazines and newspapers. Recently, there has been another clothing competition in Hollywood, which is even more sensational.</p>
<p>The leaders of the clothing competition are all wealthy stars in Hollywood. The first is Constance Bennett. The second is Katharine Hepburn. The third is Lee Sidah Heemen.</p>
<p>The method of competition is to wear clothes that are as fashionable as possible. The fashionable styles take the Paris market as the standard. The faster the news, the more fashionable the clothes worn. Often, the styles change after one or two hours. So those who get the news slowly fall behind. All three of them have special contracts with radio stations in Paris to provide them with the fastest news.</p>
<p>Each of them tried their best to influence the news media to publish more of their criticisms. But there is no definitive answer as to who is the best.</p>
<h3 id="e248">### Film Novel Cavalcade (5) <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>The audience in the theater was overjoyed to hear this news. The women were overly happy, not knowing whether to cry or laugh, but they were moved in their hearts, and tears welled up in their eyes as they walked out of the theater. Keane and Margaret were also among the crowd, walking and singing on the road like a tide. Margaret danced a waltz on the road. But there was also a terrible thing, which was the list of soldiers' casualties published in the newspapers every day. The first time, they quickly looked through it, and the second time, they carefully and fearfully checked it again, fearing that they had missed an important name in the first moment of negligence. Keane looked through it line by line, and when she saw that there was no Robert Mayo's name in a line, her heart felt like a big stone falling to the ground. Soon Robert returned in triumph.</p>
<p>Although Robert survived, the affairs of the world after that were like a revolving lantern, changing endlessly one after another. The first and most memorable thing was the death of Queen Victoria. Keane still remembered the people standing quietly outside Buckingham Palace late at night, waiting for the announcement of the Queen's condition. Every day, she read the news in the newspaper that the Queen was about to die, and felt something stuck in her throat, but Bridges stood respectfully beside her and said: "Even without the Queen, Britain will still be fine." Later, the Queen died, and Keane and her children watched the funeral procession passing through the street from the balcony. Joey suddenly asked his mother: "Why did Queen Victoria have to die?" Keane looked at her little son with tears in her eyes and said: "Because she is very, very old and too tired." The soldiers slowly passed by, and the two children saw their father leading the way and whispering to each other. Victoria's coffin was displayed on a gun carriage, so small that it looked like a child's coffin. Joey said to his mother again: "She must have been very small when she was alive." Keane quickly said: "She is very great. Don't you see five kings behind her, riding horses behind her?"</p>
<p>The Victorian era has come to an end, and Edward has ascended the throne. The current Britain is a completely different world. Robert has been knighted. The two children have grown up. Bridges and Ellen have left their employers to open a hotel. In the beginning, Keane often took the children to see them. Fanny's small figure was as beautiful as a flower. But Bridges was addicted to alcohol, and Ellen tried her best to hide it. They opened their own shop and had broken away from the servant class, so they were even more arrogant than ordinary people. Keane gradually dared not go again. After a while, Keane no longer asked about this pair of old and trusted servants. So she did not know that Fanny was gradually attracted to many playboys, and she also heard nothing about Bridges being killed. (To be continued)</p>
