<h3 id="c30">外交方針 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>及「公文處理」改革經過</p>
<p>外交方針與内政方針一致</p>
<p>（南京）行政院二十八日紀念週、到各部會長官及全院職員二百餘人、汪院長主席、並報告外交方針問題、及處理公文之改革經過、謂在未報告之前、有先要聲明的一事、兄弟每次在中央黨部、在國民政府、在行政院紀念週、所作報告、或由自己筆錄、或由同志筆記、經本人校閱修正、然後交中央通訊社發表、星期一日所作報告、星期二日便可以在報上刋出、這種稿件是兄弟所負責的、但京中夜報、往往根據别的紀錄、未經兄弟校正、即日發表、遂致與原意不符、而各通訊社因其發表在前、據以傳播於國内外、以訛傳訛、雖然第二日發表原稿、可作更正、而先一日的訛傳、已足以引起不少無謂的誤會、如今特再鄭重聲明一句、對於一切未經本人校閱修正的紀錄、兄弟槪不負責、今天所要報告的、有兩件事、</p>
<p>第一件是外交方針問題關於外交方針、是由中央决定的、外交部不過執行中央所决定之方針而已、中央所决定之方針、曾於儉電偕同蔣委員長、有所申述、其最要的意義、是舉國人民要沉痛的自己認明、現時中國是處於積弱的地位、不但積弱、同時更處於被侵害的地位、這種地位、在中國是空前的國難、可是十九世紀以來、世界上的國家民族、遇着這樣國難的、也不一而足、有些便覆亡了、有些還能掙扎至於今日、國難的形態、各國同的、便是認淸了自己所處的地位以求自救自存、用不着張皇、也用不着憤激、例如普法戰後的法國、歐洲大戰後的德國、便是榜樣、法國當時的名言、是『時時放在心裏、却不放在口裏』、德國更是忍氣呑聲、埋頭苦幹、直到如今、還是這樣、我曾聽見人說、『我們練好三千架飛機、定能報仇、這直是廢話、你如今有三千架飛機没有呢、人家許你從容練好三千架飛機麽、你從容練好三千架飛機的時候、人家已練好四千架五千架、又怎麽樣呢、以上三個問題、若不能解答、則這樣廢話、以不</p>
<p>說爲宜、古人曾說『有謀人之心、而使人知之者殆也』、我還不是這個意思、因爲我們只求自救自存、不是什麽謀人、也許連自救自存都没時間與機會、可以做到、只是一息尙存、此志不容稍懈便了、謀人固談不到、至於與人拉攏、求人援助、那更談不到、我從前曾說『設有相當的國力、不但不能與人言抵抗、也不能與人言親善』、換句話說、『能自存始能共存、不能自存則必不能共存』、如今有些人說什麽親甲派、又有些人說什麽親乙派、其爲廢話、較前尤甚、這一方面的拉攏尙未奏效、而他一方面的衝突早已見功、如果我們能認淸了目前所處的地位决不會走此險着、須知我們目前所處的地位、如大病臨危、除了對症下藥之外、一切飲食、只能淸淡、若驟然滋補、不但無益病體、反致促其死亡、與人拉攏、求人援助、便是病勢未减而妄進補品、危險孰過於此、所以我們今日、外交方針與内政方針完全一致、第一句是發展民力發展人民之生產能力、第二句也是發展民力發展人民之生產能力、不過發展之目的、在於自救自存、故那些是當務之急、那些是不急之務、不能不有詳細審愼的分别抉擇、這是我們所當注意的、</p>
<p>第二件是行政院關於公文處理之改革的經過</p>
<p>關於處理公文、兄弟覺得過去積弊、對於</p>
<p>行政效率上之影響甚力、故於六月二十日在行政院會議席上、提出召開審查會議計劃改革、參加審查者、爲行政院秘書處政務處及各部會共十四個機關、歷時兩個多月、開會凡五次、各審查人員均能不辭勞苦、且於酷暑之下、照常工作、繼續研究、卒於前星期二日完成初步工作、這實在是兄弟所感佩的、</p>
<p>過去處理公文的手續、何以要改革呢、因爲行政是專門技術之一種、行政最重効率、而欲增進効率、則必須使行政現代化合理化、這不是一朝一夕所能奏効的、然我們今日欲求政治能負起新時代之新使命、則首先要注意於行政上之各種改革、公文處理即其一端、</p>
<p>過去處理公文手續之第一個弊病是「遲」、而所以遲慢的原故、因爲辦事的人歡喜把公文長期旅行、而長期旅行又可分爲兩種、其一是兜圈子、由甲機關送至乙機關、由乙機關送至丙機關、由丙機關送至丁機關、依舊由丁機關送至甲機關、這樣兜圈子的旅行、是毫無意義的、其原故在各機關遇事推宕、以致成此現象、二是沿途逗遛、一件公事送至甲機關、隨意躭擱幾天、轉送至乙丙丁、各機關亦復如此、本來一兩日可以解决的事、往往躭擱至一兩星期或一兩月、其原故在各機關遇着不能推宕的公事、仍然不肯負責、即刻去辦、以致成此現象、而所以弄成此兩種現象的原故、全因爲公文處理的方法、不能合理、所以不肯辦事的、樂得不辦事、而肯辦事的反致不能辦事、兄弟最先的感覺是有一次會議席上、想起一件各部審查的公事、久未奉覆、問起原因、原來那件公事、因爲性質上須交有關係的甲乙丙三部會同審查、而這件公文由行政院發到三部的時候、經過科員科長秘書參事之手、以至於次長部長、須若干日、三部派出審查員又須若干日、審查員審查結果報告該管長官、又須若干日、三部會稿具覆行政院、又須若干日、這已經夠兩三星期的了、假使從科員起隨意躭擱、那更多花日子了、假使三部之中</p>
<p>有一部不能如期派出審查員、那更多花日子了、假使審查員還要各自請示該管長官、那更多花日子了、如是兩三星期以至兩三個月、毫不爲奇、我們發覺這種長期旅行的辦法、會把萬事墮壞於無形、所以即時改革、例如星期二院議、將某種公事交給甲乙丙三部會同審查、同時派本院秘書處政務處人員參加、限於本星期五在院開審查會、各審查員先期取得該管長官意旨、出席審查、意見相同、即時於是審查案件、一星期内便可完畢了、有時審查意見不能盡同、則定期再開第二次審查會、那怕再開第三次第四次第五次、那是有進行的、有意義的、與無進行無意義的長期旅行不同、我們改革了這一件公事之後、進而改革其他一切類似之公事、總之、變遲爲快、而其方法不是輕率了事、而是負責進行、因爲負責進行、則兜圈子沿途逗遛等等惡習可以除去、而公文也不致呌長期旅行的苦了、此是改革處理公文手續之第一點、</p>
<p>過去處理公文手續的第二個弊病是「複」有許多不必復的公文、因爲没有不復的標準、於是照例的復來復去、除了替紙張店擴張銷路没有其他意義、如今定了不復公文的標準、便省去許多時間和物力</p>
<p>了、</p>
<p>改革處理公文手續之第三點爲採用標點、關於此點、有些人以爲不必要、不知道無標點則句讀不明批核旣感困難、閱讀更易錯誤、會議席上、閱讀文件、往往因句讀不明、讀者不知所以、聽者莫名其妙、採用標點、雖起稿的人、手續較繁、而核閱公文之數十人、其所節省之時間實大、不但可使公文易於批閱、有時還可以免除許多不必發生之錯誤、記得有一段故事、一個兒子、寄了八個月餅給他父親、信上寫着、「寄上月餅八個父親收用、」因爲没有標點、本來是「寄上月餅八個、父親收用、」的他的父親讀作「寄上月餅八個父親收用、」於是懐疑起來、說道「八個父親、我是一個、其他七個那裏去找呢、」這固然是笑話、但司法訴訟案件上、居然有類此笑話的實事、從前有一個人家死了兒子之後、遣他媳婦歸寗、立了一條字據道、「准你回家嫁不得回來服侍我翁姑、」本來是「准你回家嫁、不得回來服侍我翁姑」的、後來發生糾紛、讀作「准你回家、嫁不得回來服侍我翁姑、」意思便完全相反了、這都是不用標點之弊、這雖然不是常有的情事、然由此已可見標點之重要了、</p>
<p>第四點是公文檢查、公文固然怕遲、同時也怕漏、此次改革有嚴密之檢查規定、使公文不致有「遲」與「漏」之弊、</p>
<p>第五點是檔案整理、因爲從前處理擋案的法子不好、致使負責長官、對於案情内容、往往疏忽、無從查考、如今規定、有總檢查卡片之設置、使最高級長官、知全部之内容、如圖書目錄然、幷定整理方法、使易於檢查一索可得</p>
<p>以上五端、可以說是這次處理公文改革的幾個要點、至於詳細條目、經已擬定規程、曾參加此次審查會議的當能爲同僚諸君一一詳述、兄弟今天不過略舉一二、以促諸君之注意而已、此次改革、只是處理手續範圍、而且只是一個起端、至於公文程式之根本改造、則尙須繼續注意、以求達到最後之目的、這又是兄弟所希望於本院同僚諸君、與各部會全體官員的、末了、還有一點、是兄弟所希望於同僚的、剛纔所說、將公文來長期旅行、是各級職員間通常易有的病毛、可是除了這件毛病之外、還有一件更大的毛病、便是將公事永遠監禁、這件毛病、惟有長官乃有此威權、本來長官對於一件公事、可以</p>
<p>可决、可以否决、可以修正、可以審查、這些都是有進行的、惟有不可不否不加修正不付審查、而將他塞在公事檯中的抽屜裏頭、那就是没進行了、那公文便被監禁起來了、這種監禁、少則幾星期、多則幾個月、或竟至無期、所以說是永遠監禁、這種永遠監禁、是無進行的、兄弟對於公事有一個信念、是進行、進行有善有惡、不進行似乎無善無惡、然萬事墮壞於無形、可以說純然是惡、是萬萬要不得的、兄弟要求各位同僚、如果兄弟有將公文監禁起來的時候、各位同僚必須對兄弟提出抗議、長官雖然有威權、但他的威</p>
<p>權、只能用於可决否决修正審查等等進行的意義上、而不能用於不進行的意義上、兄弟自己痛心疾首的、要除去這些積弊、兄弟因此誠心實意、求各位同僚共同除去這些積弊、這些積弊、各機關均有、是長官的罪惡、不是屬員的罪惡、但是屬員如有不斷的提出抗議、則長官至少也可少犯些罪惡了、這是兄弟末了、所希望於各位同僚的、（二十八日中央社電）</p>

<p>（東京）宋財長在日本領海内、始終拒見日記者、東報論宋財長返國後之情勢云、財宋尙在美時、黄郛汪精衛及蔣介石已在廬山商定對日政策、華北局面不致因宋返國而受任何變動、由日本國内經濟之前途而論、財宋因已得到歐美之支持、返國後或更堅决與日作經濟戰、提高關稅及新定提防傾銷關稅法等、與日開始更激烈之關稅戰、此種政策或難得避免、至於武力抗爭、宋財部亦不致主張硬幹、但事關於經濟戰、日貨因四面受敵、更加經濟困難、亦可謂在意料中之事、（二十八日華聨電）</p>

<p>丨用大兵保護敲剥丨</p>
<p>哈爾濱通信、日本略取了满洲、到現在快要二年了、在這兩年之中、繼以熱河戰爭、我們覊旅異域的人、不但是目繫日帝國主義的横行、實施其「亡道」主義、而且親</p>
<p>身嘗試過「亡道」的滋味、</p>
<p>日本人侵東北的方法、凡是到過東北的都看見、幷且都曉得牠所用的手段、自從所謂满洲國成立以來、局勢更變了、從前中國總還存着一個空名、至少我們中國人走路說話還便當些、現在呢、不同了、表面上的秩序、（祇限於鐵路沿缐的城市）似乎是好些、可是日本人所謂的土匪、就中國民族立塲說是義勇軍、依舊是出没無常、特别是北满各地、與吉會路沿缐頂厲害、關東軍司令部、曾經自己誇耀說是秩序已行恢復、從此可以過太平日子、其實所謂恢復、所謂太平、祇是在南满路上幾個大城市或大連而已、其他的地方都不在内、至於離開鐵路三四十里以外的地方就不得淸靜、日本軍隊、最初到東北的時候、極力要奪取權力、所以主力都集中於幾個大城市和强奪幾處鑛山、襲奪華資經營的產業、使東北三省的社會經濟越見衰落、同時這種辦法、也不能解决日本國内的經濟恐慌這個難題、於是牠轉換牠的政策、從城市轉向於農村、實行其武裝移民政策、牠移民的地方、大家都知道是松花江邊上的佳木斯、因爲這裏北满區域内最　腴雨量最適當的地方、而且待墾的生地很多、中國人又曾在那裏出過很大的勞力、有許多地方都開闢過了、所以日本人特别提出來作牠的移民試騐區、去年十月第一批移民五百人到了佳木斯、他們都帶有步槍、幷配備得有適當數目的子彈、但没有家眷、照現在的情况看恐怕終於不能帶家眷去、其原因是、第一、那邊的日常生活幷不安定、時常有義勇軍出入、這種軍隊又專門與日本人爲難、於是使他們不能安心種地、第二、是天氣太冷、冬天要冷到零下四十度、差不多要有半年住在屋子裏、日本人已是過不慣這種生活、日本女人不用講是更過不來了、第三、飲食也十分不便、吃慣了大米的人、那吃得來高梁、即令天天吃白麵、也是件苦事、生活旣有這樣的麻煩、他們去的目的又是爲了生活、所以半年不到、五百人中就有五十個人公然的落伍了、還有一百零幾人逃回日本去了、所剩下的不過三百零幾人、第二批武裝移民、在日本國内竟不能募足五百、結果祇有四百五十人、於本年七月到達了佳木斯、他們這一羣移民就一般的精神上講還比去年的不如、不過他們的組織更週密、武器的使用更靈便了、幷且爲了他們（移民）耕作需要、除去開墾之外、還運用政權的掩護而實行收占中國農民的土地、有的償還幾十分之幾的地價、每頃地給價一元至三元、有的且硬用兵力强取不問你賣與不賣、直捷了當的拿去完事、被壓迫而又頂老實的中國農夫、還有什麽可說、又那裏敢說什麽呢、</p>
<p>他們占領、中國人的地土就作爲日本自耕農自己的土地、現時日本移民正在修神社、建醫院·改革中國人所用的農具、高倡了若干年的移民政策、費了一年來以上的時間、農民自己有槍之外、還要有相當大的兵力在四週的縣分、村鎭上駐着保護牠、兩萬多兵駐在中東路沿線、事實上不過保護了七百幾個移民、於此我們不能不講牠的移民政策不是失敗、但是牠依然有地方去求彌補的、第一個就是南满路和南满路沿路的產業收入的以及九·一八事變後所奪取中國資本所建築的鐵道、如洮昻路·奉海路·打通路·等都成了南满路的財產、第二個是把中國人經營的產業如礦山、各工廠往往用反满的罪名没收了去、</p>
<p>日本移民雖然是失敗了、牠在經濟上求得彌補之外、在政治上還有牠的移官運動、瀋陽·長春·的旅館（日本人所開的）天天客满、都是到來尋官做的、現在每個縣公署、除了有一個僞國人作傀儡之外、另外有一個日本人去作參事、事實上日本參事、（有人說他是指導員）總覧全權、但還不能安插從日本來個大批官吏、（現時東北四省境内已經任職的日本官總數有一千五百多名）而住在旅館、還有二千多、所以傀儡國總務廳、又計畫着每縣分四區或五區、每區都每安置一個參事或指導員、都由雙重國籍的日本人充任、一面監督傀儡縣長、一面轄治人民、這一般人的敲剥貪汚、比原來先顧面子的舊官僚更不要臉，更兇横、因此從前對日本表好感的奴才們、現在漸漸地有些悔悟了、可惜的是缺少對祖國效力的機會、（八月二十二日）</p>

<p>上海市各業同業公會、前經擬具强制同業入會辦法、呈奉實業部批示、已呈行政院轉咨立法院、於修正法規時、加以注意、但昨聞腸業·華洋雜貨業·化妝品業·等各業公會、以工商同業公會法第七條條文、業經去年修正、同業均「應」入會、文字肯定、該案程序、已至行政機關執行之地步、母須轉咨立法機關之必要、特聨名致函市商會、其原文云、逕啓者、案查二十一年十月十五、接准貴會函開、本月十五日、奉社會局第四六四○號訓令内開案奉市政府訓令第二八九○號内開、案奉行政院第三八九三號訓令内開、案</p>
<p>奉國民政府洛字第二三八號訓令内開、查工商同業公會法、前經制定、明令公布、茲將該法第七條條文酌加修正、應即通飭施行、除分令外、合行抄發修正條文、令仰知照、並轉飭所屬一體知照、此令等因、轉行到會、並附修正工商同業公會法第七條條文「同業之公司行號、均應爲同業公會之會員、推派代表出席於會會、但受除名之處分者、不在此限、」竊思法爲國家之强行規則、一經制定公佈、通飭施行、行政機關、自負有執行責任、固不待有所請求、否則法之效力、何能發生、如果法律不經執行、不但成爲具文、抑且失去行政權威、工商同業公會法第七條、「得」字已修正爲「應」字、文字肯定、同業均應入會、質言之、凡不入會之同業、行政機關有權强制入會、假使仍在其不受法之拘束、豈不使守法之同業、深感權義不平、立法精神、行政權威、兩有所失、前經各業公會聨名擬呈督促同業</p>
<p>入會辦法、「因人民有遵守國家法令之義務、應由主管官廳布告、限令入會、绍逾期不遵、除以反抗國家行政權論罪外、强制執行入會、」敝會等愚見所及、殊覺允當、嗣於本年六月二十六日奉實業部商字第一八四九六號批開、呈悉、所稱各節、業經本部另案呈請行政院轉咨立法院於修正法規時、加以注意、　期得有救濟之適當辦法、仰即知照、此批等因、捧誦之下、毛髮悚然、查工商同業公會法第七條、旣蒙立法機關修正、國府洛字第二三八號訓令通飭施行、案牘可考、本案程轉咨立法機關、令人大惑不解、誠恐實業部對於本案程序疏於考核、或有人謂關於同業入會、應於公會法施行細則、訂有補充規定、以期同業公會法第七條發生效力、殊不知同業入會之效力、全在同業公會法第七條文字之規定、試證已入會者可知、而與施行細則無關、否則凡入會之同業、都可藉口細則無補充規定而退會、况細則不過爲同業公會法之助法、𢌞查十九年七月二十五日部令修正公佈之</p>

<p>同字異之反復申請、自露其文牘知識之迂闊凡法一經公佈、通飭施行、就有拘束之效力、今若再任同業不入會、則已入會者、勢必出會、公會永無健全之望、所謂建設事業、徒成畫餅、甚或公會形成瓦解、商會基礎動搖事非滬埠一隅、影響全國、瞻顧前途杞憂曷極、想貴會素具</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>今年是個「國貨年」，已爲大家所公認了。可是從種種方面觀察起來，似乎今年還不僅是個「國貨年」，因爲内審國情，實在是事件太多了。譬如說、有了塘沽協定，國難可以暫告段落；故今年可稱「協定年」，亦可以稱「國難中止年」。國難旣已中止，則「外」可不必「攘」，而「内」郤大可「安」！故今年亦可稱「安内年」。政府將以建設求統一、自不能不借材異地；於是國聨技術人員行將來華，與我國合作，開我國歷史上的新紀錄。是今年亦可稱「國聨合作年」。航空捐自開辦以來、小民尙能深明大義，勉解慳嚢。這亦大可紀念之事。倘說今年爲「航空年」，誰曰不宜？再說我國財政，困難已達極點。源旣無可開，流自不能不節。故各機關的經費，莫不减成發給；而服務人員的薪金，有打七折八扣的。是今年亦可稱「緊縮年」。</p>
<p>殺價正賤得不得了，美麥偏已訂定，行將進口；故今年稱「榖賤年」也可；稱「美麥進口年」也，亦無不可。大廉價的布招廣告，誘人於都市之中。聞薄如紙張的印度綢，每尺僅値二三角錢。其他絲綢布疋以及日用物品，亦無不便宜異常。故今年亦可稱「廉價年」或「便宜年」。</p>
<p>如果說今年是「考試年」，想一輩的未來主人翁都要點頭稱是罷。他們自畢業以至升學，統計要經過學校裏的最後考試，會考以及升學考試三種丨畢業前的各種測騐，還不在内。此外各省爲國求賢的高等普通檢定考試，有已舉行的，也有將舉行的。考試旣這麽多，故今年亦可稱「考試年」。</p>
<p>還有什麽「奬金年」，茸餘君已經詳細說過，見九日本刋，我也不再詞費了。</p>
<h3 id="c189">上海之謎 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>有很多人反對上海满地是黄金的金科玉律、但有很多人、仍認上海满地是黄金，是一句不可磨滅的名言。在上海，只須登一條略盡義務，月給津貼十元的徴求廣告，不上半天，便有成梱的報名信來應徴。若是登一條徴求職業的廣告，除了女子之外，守上一年半載，大半是不會有人請敎的。假使在馬路上溜一下子，便會看見有無數在飢餓線上打轉的乞丐，裝着又似哭，又似笑的尊範，伸手向人求一個子兒的佈施。黄昏從富麗堂皇的大飯店，一直到煤氣燈都没有的小弄堂口，都擠满着肉的出賣者，伊們找不到麵包，只得把父母傳下的肉做買賣。這些，雖不過略舉數則，已在在都暴露出上海的貧窮。在上海，非但拾不到黄金，而且有給上海呑噬的危險。</p>
<p>但從社會的又一面看來，同一個問題，却有不同的見解。失業了讀讀廣告，倘使脚跑得比人快，也可得到每月十元的位置。登一下徴求職業廣告，機會好，也可解决失業問題，尤其是女士們的徴求廣告，更有奇效。行乞，不需本錢不需學問與勞力、只要會裝又似哭，又似的笑臉，便可維持生命。就這幾則，已處處表現着上海不窮上海满地是黄金、每一天，有無數拾黄金的人到上海來，每一天，有無數裝满了腰包，或是拾不到一個大的人，離開上海。儘有許多人大聲疾呼地喊着經濟壓迫，失業恐慌，但上海的人口，却年有進步，而且也不很聞得有活活餓死的。</p>
<p>上海，是不是满地黄金，這眞是一個千古之謎。</p>
<h3 id="c190">婦女心理之測騐 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>心理學家，只知道『兒童心理學』『罪犯心理學』『變態心理學』，甚麽『個性型』『下意識』『幻覺』『錯覺』『情緒』『觀念』等等；婦女的心理，委實没有徹底的研究。雖然中國的哲學家李石岑，俄國的拉斯蒲丁，對於婦女心理、研究獨深，究竟難稱登堂入室。所以孔老先生說：『婦人與小人爲難養也！』詩人說：『千金難買美人心』。便是這個道理。</p>
<p>畢竟德國人學識高明，據柏林電訊說：『德政府近有『婦女時裝局』之設立，即由現任宣傳文化部部長高博爾的夫人任其事。該局將於八月中，開一衣裝材料展覧會，現方在積極活動中。說者謂：這種企圖，實爲改革現代婦女的心理，引起德國國家的特性，以期與新德潮流，相並進步云』。從這個消息看來，婦女的心理，不是可在衣裝上測騐嗎？要改變婦女心理，但應改革婦女的衣裝開始了。</p>
<p>長短可以度；重輕可以權；多少可以量；只有『美』『醜』，是没有標凖器去測騐的，所以印度斐洲的女子，也有傾國傾城的美人。雄狗瞧雌狗，公鷄瞧母鷄，没有不美麗的。在三四十年以前，蘇州頭，揚州脚，闊鑲滾，假尾子，這不是標準美人的打扮嗎？現在從短衣窄袖，慢慢兒變做了赤足露體。也許不久的將來，要實『裸體』，返於原人時代，這是婦女的什麽心理，恕我不是心理學大家，不能回答。</p>
<p>或者道：這是人心由『醇厚』而日趨於『澆溥』，婦德由『貞淑』而日即於『淫佚』的緣故。在下以爲不然，這種現象，確爲文明進化的徴象，天下大同的先兆，何以呢？譬如現在外國人，能把植物界裏的纎維素，來製造黏性絲與醋酸纎維素，引長爲極細的絲縷，這便呌做『人造絲』，婦女製了衣裝，何等漂亮美麗。國產綢緞，當然變做了鶴髮鷄皮的老太婆，要落伍了。假使再有人發明了『玻璃絲』，把矽酸，燐酸，硼酸，鎢酸等鹽類，研究而應用之。那末，它的利便，還要過於『人造絲』了。㈠不必洗澣；只要用火燃了一回，便如新的一般不是極合現下懶惰婦女的心理嗎？㈡富於肉感：着了『玻璃』製的衣服。自然肉感豐富，不减曲缐之美，當軸雖要禁止『裸體運動』，有了『玻璃衣』也可以招架了。不是極合現下肉感婦女的心理嗎？這些都是文明進化的好現象，要把『澆薄』『淫佚』的罪名，加在現代婦女頭上，眞是寃哉枉也啊！</p>

<p>— 葉顧</p>
<p>朋友的家裏，僱着一個女傭人；現在這個女傭人，是生病了；生着</p>
<p>很重的病·黄的臉，萎靡的精神，在在都是顯出伊的没有氣力；没有氣力來做着工作。照理，即如不能住醫院療養，亦該是要回到老家去休息休息；可是事實上，伊旣没有錢來休養，並且爲了在遙遠的家裏，有着一個吸鴉片的不做事的丈夫，因此不得不忍受了病魔的纒繞，爲了生活而做着苦工！</p>
<p>每天，淸晨，人家在好夢裏，伊早就起來了，倒馬桶，燒早飯，擦檯掃地，一刻不停，接着買小菜，燒中飯，洗衣服，燒晚飯；主人打麻雀時，白天，伊去服侍他們，深夜，伊也去服侍他們，一直等到主人去睡了，伊才也去睡覺！第二天，又是這般地，像牛馬樣的，</p>
<p>做着笨重的工作！</p>
<p>哦！雖然伊現在是病啦，病的一點兒氣力也没有；可是伊爲了自己的生命，自己丈夫的生活，也不得不忍住了病體而工作着呵！不做工，没得飯吃；主人家的事，又呌誰去做；請替工，工錢是别人家的；自己又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>呵！世界上眞不知有多少的窮人啊！窮人啊！爲了每一天的生活，不工作不勞動，没有飯吃；於是，每一天，總得要出賣自己的氣力，自己的身體！來做着牛馬一般笨重的工作！</p>
<p>呵！窮人，出賣着自己的體力的勞動者，該是不能夠生病的；生了病，不能工作；爲了生活，就是有病，也不能不工作；那未，結果，是死路一條！</p>

<p>趙自强看完了，便道：老關，你也眞有些豈有此理，你怎麽有半個月没有回去。軍營裏有的是定章，一個星期歸宿兩次，你有家不顧，有功夫不去，豈有此理。關耀武道：一點兒也不豈有此理。你想罷，現在日子還短，六點鐘離營，我非扯開腿跑，趕不了進城。這都罷了。第二日六點鐘歸營，這是如何辦的到，天還没亮啦。趙自强道：你不會把家眷接到海甸來嗎？關耀武搖頭道：我根本上就不願回家，接家眷來作什麽？回去是媳婦囉唆着，孩子們吵閙着，閙得心中煩躁。倒不如在營裏混着。我家裏，現在連大人帶孩子，總得四五十塊錢一個月，才能夠混過去。你想，餉又不能按月的發，我一個月倒要拿出這些個錢去，我自己還能花幾個錢？這個家，眞是把我累壞了。趙自强道：你旣然那樣的不愛家。爲什麽和我做起媒來，到是這樣子起勁？關耀武笑道：我起什麽勁？你没有一趟一趟的來運動我嗎？檢閱委員快到了，走罷。他說着，竟自嘆着氣下樓去了。趙自强怏怏若有所失，也只得走回自己連部來。檢閱的日子，前後共有七天，今日檢閱衛生方面，最後的一天了。檢閱委員到了趙連，稍看了一看，見樓板上的被褥，蓋着雪白的布，厠所裏舗了雪白的石灰，行人道上也灑着黄土，臉上表示着歡喜的樣子，自去了。趙自强心想忙了半個月：就爲的是這半小時的漂亮，想起來眞也就夠着無聊的了。就是關耀武那樣不肯花錢的人，也是把腰包裏錢掏出來，墊着花上，那未，可見得這好勝的這個念頭，誰也是打不破的。（一七二）</p>

<p>利用郵遞使圖書流通深入鄕村</p>
<p>編制「讀書指導」引導失學靑年</p>
<p>申報流通圖書館、創辦未及一年、而扶植社會文化事業、岡不盡心、故成績斐然、爲本市人民所</p>
<p>稱道茲中華圖書館協會開第二次年會於北平、該館本已往經騐、覺目下急應舉辦者、擬就議案</p>
<p>二則、提出該會、記者覓得原稿、亟錄於此、</p>
<p>㈠圖書館事業應積極推行使於最短時期内普及鄕鎭案、</p>
<p>甲·理由、現今之推進文化之利器者有三、曰報章、曰雜誌、曰書籍、而爲之作推動之工具者有二、曰學校、曰圖書館、而圖書館之性質、與學校又不同、蓋學校之目的爲作育人才、所負之使命爲啟發、爲訓導、除所啟發訓導而外、其他研究不與漹、而經濟艱窘者亦不與焉、圖書館則不然、無論貧富、不分階級、一體供給以所需之智議、所謂有敎無類者也、此固盡人而知之矣、然圖書館之設置、在都市則較多、設備亦完善、藏書亦豐富、至於較小之縣城、因經費之限制、雖有亦祇一二、設備亦不免因陋就簡、逮乎市鎭、則千百中已難得一二、遑論鄕村、此非鄕村市鎭之人不能讀書也、亦非鄕村市鎭之人不喜讀書也、良以窮鄕僻壤、無此等文化機關之設置耳、吾國以農立國、鄕村與都市之人民、雖無準確之統計、大約爲七與三之比、是推行鄕村敎育應重於都市也、晚近憂時之士、羣以「到農村去」爲口號、呼聲日高、宣傳日廣、提倡不遺餘力、然農民囿於聞見、尙多迷信神權、常識欠缺理智窒塞、卽欲爲之改革、而彼等狃於積習、效果亦甚微尠、故通俗書籍能流通於鄕鎭間、使彼等錯誤之觀點、潛移默化、然後施以相當之勸導、卽不至於扞格不入、而此舉能於農民本身中、造成多量之戰士、尤爲切要、國家前進、亦利賴之矣、乙·辦法、㈠就原有公私立圖書館外、各區各鄕鎭分設圖書流通處、附設於區公所及其他公共塲所、應具備報章雜誌及通俗圖書等、專供鄕鎭市民及農民來社或借回閱覧、此項辦法、應呈請敎育部令各縣敎育局一體舉辦、庶施行便利而易收實效、上項辦法、轉輾費時、决非短時期所能辦竣、而各鄕區圖書館未曾成立以前、可利用郵局寄遞、果能辦理完善、則凡郵程所達之處、卽圖書館事業推行之處、收效必甚廣大、而同時宜以全國圖書館名義、呈請敎育交通兩部、令行全國郵局、凡遇任何圖書館寄遞或寄回圖　書、應予以種種之便利、郵資亦予以極度之减低、事關推進文化敎育、諒當局必能允准也、關於郵遞圖書、聞浙江私立流通圖書館、已曾施行、本館則暫在本埠試騐期中、㈢倘此項辦法爲全國各圖書館所贊同而樂於採用、則尙有進一步之辦法、可將全國圖書館、視藏書之多寡、交通之便利、所在地距離之遠近、酌量劃分爲若干區域、在每一區域之内、指定一個或數個圖書館、專供該區域内任何民衆借閱、至於章程、期限、保證等等、可依各地之環境及不同的情形而各自酌訂之、㈣一種書籍爲一個區域内之圖書館所獨有、而另一區域需要此項書籍閱讀者、得以圖書館名義互相轉借、倘係孤本絕版、則可以抄錄副本應之、上項辦法、如果見諸事實、則雖風氣閉塞之處、亦得享受知識之膏澤、而較之以巡𢌞書車祇便利近地讀者、則其意義之偉大、有非道里計矣、是否有當、敬候公决、</p>
<p>㈡圖書館應共同編制「讀書指導」以作閱覧者之準繩案</p>
<p>甲·理由、古今典籍、浩如烟海、自歐風東漸、學者復孜孜於東西學術、因之著作更多、譯本迭出、初學者雖有志研究於某一學科、而有茫無適從之感、終之盲人瞎馬、隨意揀取、一遇頓挫、便卽委棄、再易另一學科、亦復如是、有終其身而無成者、不亦大可慨乎、然欲匡救此弊、惟有編制「讀書指導」、由淺入深、按步就班、庶閱覧者有所遂循、不至浪費光陰耳、然茲事體大、非有特長、不克任此、蓋一字一句、與閱覧者關係至巨、固不可率爾操觚也、乙·辦法、㈠於會員内選舉專才、分任艱巨、其有長於社會科學者、卽以社會科學屬之、其有長於自然科學者、卽以自然科學請其任之、㈡如遇會員中缺少此項人才者、卽聘請有高深學問之專家担任之、㈢讀書指導」之排列·須分「必讀」與「參考」兩類、每類各分科目若干種、每科書名之排列、必須由淺及深、每册書名之下、必附以簡明之提要、而此「讀書指導」上所載書名、當爲切要之書、全國各圖書館均宜置備一份或數份、以備閱覧者閱讀、如能編制妥善、則閱覧者如航行大海而得南針、閱覧各書、可以事半而功倍矣、是否有當、敬候公决、</p>
<p>高中以上學校</p>
<h3 id="c209">應酌設號兵俾利軍訓 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>市敎局奉令轉飭各校遵照</p>
<p>上海市敎育局訓令本市各中學云、案奉敎育部訓令第七○○號内開、案准訓練總監部咨開、頃據各校軍事敎官報告略稱、查號音亦爲敎育之一種、故學生常常敦促、使用號兵、祇以方案無此規定、故各校多似闕如、擬請通飭設置、俾利軍訓等情據此、查號音之爲用、原以節進退、肅紀律、整步伐、齊作息、平時資以维持全軍之秩序、臨陣代表命令之傳達、故在軍隊組織中實居重要之地位、現高中以上學校旣已施行軍事敎育、凡屬軍事課程、自應一律使用號音、俾學生有號音之常識、則號兵之設備、誠不可缺、據呈前情、相應咨達查照、卽請貴部通令各高中以上學校遵照、最少每校須設置號兵一名、（號兵工作除吹奏號音外、平時兼武器之淸潔保管、曁隨同軍事敎官服各種勤務、）復利軍訓、並盼見變爲荷、再學校内一切作息起居、如能一律使用號音、使養成學生軍隊化之生活、則尤爲妥宜、併請飭知等由、准此查號音爲軍事敎育之一種、使學生明瞭號音起見、各校自可添設號兵一名、俾資吹奏、並負軍事訓練上一切勤務、除咨復並分</p>
<p>令外、合亟令仰該局轉飭所屬公私立高中以上學校酌量辦理、等因奉此、合行令仰遵照此令云第三批</p>

<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<h3 id="c218">星期二（七月四日） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>今日之温度更高、達八十五度、空氣乾燥、水份不多、今日之比賽、比較上爲不重者、觀者亦由盛而衰、皆預備星期三再來、以觀男子單打複賽及其他緊要之比賽、第一塲之比賽、直至下午八時半才完畢、中央塲候至半天比賽已去其半、</p>
<p>才告满座、然仍有不少空位、</p>
<p>因郎德女士之勝利、英轼在女子單打複賽中、得一位置、對手爲凡列奥女士、二盤卽屈服、共僅得五局、情形並不若是之簡單、郎德在第一盤中似乎不甚高興、直至此意大利女子以三比一居先後、郎德才奮起、成五比三而六比三、郎出球無力、過於柔和、使對方常能回答、而以最好之球回擊、郎德旣居先後、頓時一振、盡出其所有、凡列奥女士之球、重有力、但毫無實用、郎德緊咬其齒、更有勝於凡列奥也、</p>
<p>傑各白女士與瑪底歐夫人在中央塲之比賽、觀者飽賞優美球藝、傑各白以六比一勝第一盤、於是瑪底歐夫人照樣奉答之、此塲爲斬球與抽球之抗爭、傑各白較取攻勢、以發球、空中球、壓殺、對付瑪底歐之底、線抽、瑪底歐以正手得球後、其回送之巧妙、幾與男子相等、球去直而快、瑪雖不常近綱、但亦能壓殺、一二兩盤雖皆一面倒、但爭鬥甚烈、如有一隙、彼此卽乘之進攻、在第三盤中、二人皆表演甚佳、傑各白擊破發球、得二比○、此種得勝發球、皆屬常事、並不視之過甚、一次傑各白失誤一容易之殺球、幾肇大禍、但挺身一振、又破對方發球、成四比二、臨了瑪以發球雙誤失敗、比賽結果、理應如此、傑各白較爲淸新、幾無一局失誤、此種有思想之擊法、雖屬女子、亦當稱許矣、</p>
<p>英國最有希望之女綱球選手郎德女士得惠勃爾登單打决賽權</p>
<p>克拉温格與史克列文女士之比賽繼之、但球技在比較上减低不少、十分之九、雙方皆站後塲抽球、初尙有味、入後則單調、史克列文之正手抽、爲其特異之點、除其有力一抽、隨之上綱、常告得分外、罕有可取、克拉温格之寳貴經騐、佔便宜不少、一二兩盤、秋色平分、史在最後得勝時期、爲其全盛時代、奔走敏速、起手亦快、其球旋向過綱、除正手抽、及難得之殺球外、史未有其他各種擊法之訓練、殊實可惜、</p>
<p>累子雙打、塲數旣多、且光怪陸離、不可捉摸潘萊休斯以五盤爲鮑塞斯尙西揚所敗、塞德史篤芬亦遭受同樣命運於奥立夫與灰克洛夫脫、兩塲同時舉行、一在中央場、一在第一塲、鮑塞斯四人中最佳、休斯尙西揚軟弱而錯誤、潘萊如此</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>新近聽見美國流行有一種睡病、勢甚猖獗。雖則症狀如何，我還不大明白，但從病名上看來，倒覺得是一種可喜的疾病。</p>
<p>第一若將這一種類似寒熱的病源菌研究出來，加以相當的中和而行注射，則有失眠症者，以後可以不患不能睡覺了。</p>
<p>第二有怕老婆，有不了事，以及有暈船病，和遭遇不幸的人，要想救一救暫時的急者，也可以享受享受這酣睡的樂趣，美國作家華盛頓歐文著的那篇有名的短篇「立泊·凡·允格耳」中的理想、到此纔可以毫不費力地實現出來，豈不是一件快事。</p>
<p>但世人的對這睡病的恐怖、似乎是因爲怕牠的一發而不能復睡。這，我想也不過是人無遠慮的一種淺見，由想得通的人看來，長眠與短睡，原是没有什麽大不了的差異的。譬如我們現代的沉醉於鴉片賭博，沉醉於醇酒婦人，沉醉於金錢權勢地位的大中華同胞，一染上了習慣，何嘗會有醒悟的時候呢？</p>
<p>暑期已過、新秋的凉爽節季又來了，我希望朝野上下，熱心於名利，角逐在武壇，文壇的衆同胞，都能去求一點睡病菌來酣睡酣睡，休養休養。這比到</p>
<p>遠上廬山，漫施靑島，去解避暑熱總要簡單便利得多。</p>
<h3 id="c227">多難的七月 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>見文先生「雜談七月」，臚述了七夕，盆踊等等的故實，不覺神往；但故實祇是故實，究竟並非現實，回頭看看現實的七月，依然呌人皺眉。住在上海的弄堂房子裏，牛郎織女怎樣地在銀河旁邊喁喁情話，不消稅是望不見的；而在機器旁邊流着熱汗，爲幾毛小洋的工資而掙扎的現代少女，當然更是無暇乞巧。馬路上白相大亨做會打醮，拿着一本捐簿挨門化捐、那聲勢差不多和鄕下攤派餉項一樣，實在說不上什麽佳節樂事。小時候聽大人們說、陰歷七月一整月，閻王老子大開鴻恩，把關在十八層地獄裏的小鬼，全部放籠，准許他們到人間騒閙，尤其是那些横死惡鬼，便趁這機會找覓替身，所以七月是個兇月，往往疫厲横行，死亡枕藉。小百姓的生命突遭侵略，就只好表示無抵抗，弄些好酒好肉欵待，意圖减少些禍殃，所謂消災延慶，這使是舉行盂蘭盆會的目的。盂蘭盆會中有無常駡狗，是小時候最喜歡聽的。據說惡鬼是怕無常的，無常雖然在駡狗，惡鬼聽了也會遠避。可是在咱們這年頭兒，人世間雖然，如此搗亂而陰間裏的閻王，却似乎在抱着一貫的放任主義，不單在七月，實在是成年成月地放任那些五喪惡鬼，在人間到處横行、騒擾不堪，小百姓是連最後一滴血一塊肉，都供了他們，盂蘭盆會已不勝其舉，而無常與惡鬼又是同類，一樣的祇會吃小百姓的好酒好肉。</p>
<p>關於七月，我鄕還有句俗諺：</p>
<p>「日也愁，夜也愁，單愁七月廿三五更頭。」</p>
<p>這是因爲七月容易起風暴，發大水，而據說七月廿三的五更時分，便是决定一年災幸的關頭。就今年說，黄河早經决了口，山東江北都已閙大水；江浙農間，正閙着旱荒和蝗災，一年休咎，已不待卜於七月廿三更頭了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，七月依然還是個多難之月。不過據故老傳說，七月三十日地藏菩薩開眼睛，小鬼們便得從此斂跡，而且八月桂花秋，天高氣爽，又當另有一番景象。那末，咱們就等着這「七月三十日」</p>
<h3 id="c228">日暮時 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 亢德</p>
<p>暮靄剛無聲地升起來，原先舒齊地像漫步樣子的街上行人，就有點散亂起來：他們要各歸各的家裏安息去了。</p>
<p>我先望望冷淸了許多的街頭，再緩緩地躑躅幾步，順着歸巢去的倦鳥飛路回到寓所。寓所在一條僻巷盡頭的一條小弄堂内，屋子不十分小，但破敗得如一</p>
<p>所枯寺。</p>
<p>僻巷已少人行，小弄堂裏除了在沙沙作響的落葉摩擦聲，只有蹲伏在暗處的野狗聽到行人足音後的狂吠。這冷不防襲人的野狗狂吠，每使我心悖，走進弄堂原把脚步放輕了的，並且迅速的走：但狗的聽覺也和牠的嗅覺一樣靈敏，我自以爲走得輕到無聲的了，而牠可仍是冷不防的呌了起來，於是我失了把脚步放輕的自主，反而大踏步的狂奔起來，牠也更兇厲的狂吠。直到直進屋裏關上大門時，我還會心跳。</p>
<p>房東家已吃過晚飯，在燈下聚着兒女媳婦閒話家常。正如小鳥般嘰嘰喳喳唱着說着的孩子，聽見足音就會叔叔叔叔的連呌，接着是房東老太太和藹的「回來了，没曾吃過飯吧，」這種問語。</p>
<p>我唔唔的回答着，走進漆黑的房裏，先摸索忘記了放在那處的火柴；好容易碰來磕去的摸索到了，待擦燃後一照油燈，透明的燈肚内看去只有一條死蛇般的燈帶殭躺着，油已盡了。一陣抑不住的煩惱襲上心來，怔怔的望着油盡了的燈臺、直到火柴的餘火燒着了指尖。擲去了火柴梗，在黑暗中默默的坐着，外邊的颯颯晚風聲聽在我耳裏也似吹在我心上。</p>
<p>『洋油没有了罷，到我們這兒來拿些去用罷。』</p>
<p>房東老太太的說話跟着開長窗的聲音傳了過來。我婉謝了她的盛情，而且立刻再摸索到火油瓶子低着頭疾忙出去。我怕再坐下去，我頰上的涙痕將落在她</p>
<p>的眼中。</p>
<p>夜風是這麽凉，我身上的衣衫是這麽單薄，雙手籠在袖管裏抱着火油瓶子走着，祇有黯淡的街燈下的自家瘦影相隨。</p>
<p>我的身和心全有些兒顫了。</p>
<h3 id="c229">馬致遠雜劇的胚胎 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>馬致遠是元代有數的文人，雜劇散曲，並稱雙絕。我以爲他的雜劇一破幽夢孤雁漢宮秋」「江州司馬靑衫泪」，（以上二劇見元曲選）「劉晨阮肇誤入桃源」，（有殘篇載在北詞廣正譜等裏面）以及「孟浩然踏雪尋梅」等，在作小令時先就有了胚胎。茲錄與此四劇有關的小令於後：</p>
<p>㈠孟慶陽，興何狂，凍騎驢灞陵橋上。便縱有些梅花入夢香，倒不如風雪銷金帳，慢慢的淺斟低唱。（撥不斷）　　㈡採藥童，乘鸞客，怨感劉郎下天台。春風再到人何在，桃花又不餐開，命薄的窮秀才，誰呌你歸去來？（四塊玉天台路）</p>
<p>㈢雁北飛，人北望，抛閃煞明妃也，漢君王小單于把盞呀剌剌唱，靑草　　　　　　　　　　　　　，　　　是思故鄕丨（四塊玉紫芝路）</p>
<p>㈣送客時，秋紅冷，商女琵琶腸斷　。可知道司馬和愁聽。月又明，酒又醒，客乍醒。（四塊玉潯陽江）</p>
<p>以上第一首是踏雪尋梅的肧胎，第二首是誤入桃源的肧胎，第三首是漢宮秋的胚胎，第四首是靑衫泪的胚胎。</p>
<p>靑衫泪一劇對於孟浩然頗致崇敬，旣云「灞陵橋踏雪尋梅客」，（第一折金盞兒）又說「詩篇壓孟浩然」，（第二折倘秀才）甚至以孟浩然爲白居易的配角，也許「踏雪尋梅」一劇，在這時已得到感興了吧？至於孟浩然死於七四○，再三十二年以後纔生出白居易來，何得同堂共語的責備，那倒是可以不心的，因爲戲究竟是戲，否則不相干的妓女也不會是白居易以前的愛人了。妓女嫁給茶商以及夜月泣琵琶等情節，與「雙漸趕蘇卿」極相似，也許受了這個故事一些影響，也未可知。</p>
<h3 id="c230">女人（五） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>望到這些霧她便笑着。她記起蒙在她心頭上一張薄薄的人事綱子。她昨天黄昏時，曾同一個女伴，坐到海邊一個岩石上，聽海濤鳴咽。波浪一個接着一個撞碎在岩石下，那女孩子年紀不過十七歲，愛了一個牧師的兒子，那牧師兒子却以爲她是小孩子，一切打算皆由於小孩子的胡塗天眞，全不近於事實所許可。那牧師兒子傷了她的心。她便一一訴說着，且說他若再只把她當小孩，她就預備自殺给他看。問那女孩子：「自殺了，他會明白麽？除了自殺難道就幷無别的辦法讓他明白嗎？而且，是不是當眞愛他？愛他卽或是眞的，這人究竟有什麽好處？」那女孩沉默了許多，昂起頭帶着羞澀的眼光，却回答說：「我自己也不知道這是怎麽回事。他所有好處在别個男孩子品性中似乎皆可以發現，我愛他似乎就只是他不理我那分驕傲處。我愛那點驕傲。」當時她以爲這女孩子眞正是小孩子。</p>
<p>但現在給她有了一個反省的機會。她不瞭解這女孩子的感情，如今去極力來求索這感情的起點與終點。</p>
<p>愛她的人可太多了，她却不愛他們，她覺得一切愛皆平凡得很，許多人皆在她面前見得又可憐又好笑。許多人皆因爲愛了她把他自己靈魂，感情，言語，行爲，某種定型弄走了樣子。譬如大風，百凡草木皆爲這風而搖動，在暴風下無一草木能夠堅凝靜止，毫不動搖。她的美麗也如大風。可是她希望的正是永遠皆不動搖的大樹，在她面前昂然的立定，不到於爲她那點美麗所征服。她找尋這種樹，却始終没有發現。</p>
<p>她想：「海邊不會有這種樹。若需要這種樹，應當向深山中去找尋。」</p>
<p>的的確確，都市中人是全爲一個都市敎育與都市趣味所同化，一切女子的靈魂，皆從一個</p>
<p>模子裏印就，一切男子的靈魂，又皆從另一模子中印出，個性與特性是不易存在，領袖準標是在共通所理解的榜樣中產生的。一切皆顯得又庸俗又平凡，一切皆轉成爲商品形式，便是人類的戀愛，没有戀愛時那分觀念，有了戀愛時那分打算，也正在商人手中轉着，千篇一律，毫不出奇。</p>
<p>海邊没有一株稍稍崛强的樹。也無一個稍稍崛强的人。爲她傾倒的人雖多，却皆在同樣情形下露出蠢像，做出同樣的事情。世故一些的先是借些别的原因同在一處，其次就失去了人的樣子，變成一隻狗了，年紀輕些的，則就只知寫出那種又組鹵又笨拙的信，愛了就謙卑諂媚，裝模作樣，眼看倒自己所作的胡塗樣子，還不能夠引動女人，旣不知道如何改善方法，便作出更可笑的表示，或要自殺，或說請你好好的防備，如何如何，一切愛不是極其愚蠢，就是極其下流，故她把這些愛看得一錢不値了。</p>
<p>眞没有一個稍稍可愛的男子。</p>
<p>她厭倦了那些成爲公式的男子，與成爲公式的愛情。她忽然想起那個女孩口中的牧師兒子。她爲自己倐然而來飄然而逝的某種好奇識所吸引，吃了點驚。她望望天空，一顆流星正劃空而逝，於是輕輕的輕輕的自言自語說道：「逝去的，也就完事了」。</p>
<p>但記憶中那顆流星，還閃著悅目的光輝。「强一些，方有光輝！」她微笑了，因爲她自覺是極强的。然而在意識之外，就潛伏了一種欲望，這欲望，這欲望是隱秘的，方向瞹昧的。</p>
<p>左拉在他的某篇小說上，爲提及一個貞靜的女人，拒絕了所有向她獻媚輪誠的一羣靑年紳</p>
<p>士，逃到一個小鄕村後，却坦然儘一個組鹵的農夫，在胃昧中吻了她的嘴唇同手足。驕傲的婦人厭　輕視了一切柔情，却能在强暴中得到快感。</p>
<p>她記起了左拉那篇小說。那作品中從前所不能理解的，現在完全理解了。倘若有那麽凑巧</p>
<p>的遭遇，她也將如故事所說，「毫不拒絕的躺到那金黄色稻草積上去。」固熱的熱情，瘋狂的愛，火熖燃燒了自己後還把另外一個也燒死。這愛情方是愛情！</p>

<h3 id="c264">「備而不用」與「用而不備」 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>在現在的社會、很有許多東西是「備而不用」，同時也有許多是「用而不備」的，這種極端左右傾的畸形病態、很可假作測騐現社會的究竟。</p>
<p>不久以前在影刋上拜讀到ＸＸ電影皇后的芳訓，說女子要保持美麗，唯一辦法是當或然生產後（其實還不如多用些勤用些「她的友」一類的東西、根本截斷生育的好）不將自己的奶乳饅小孩、事實上誠然很對，現在摩登女子，有幾個肯生育？更有幾個肯將自己的奶　養小孩？天成　小孩的一對奶子，只是敷着粉，洒着香水，深深地廢着，白天在馬路上顫巍巍的對異性示威、人類進化到此，女人的奶確是成了「備而不用」的廢物。</p>
<p>其實男人中也有「備而不用」的東西，比如住在都市裏的一些闊大哥、叨着洋老爺的恩光、把汽車搬來中國供用，他們的兩條腿便也好比摩登女子的兩座乳，年頭到尾，也門三步，也得用汽車裝運，天成要走走路的兩條腿，也確實了成「備而不用」的贅物。</p>
<p>多着啦，這類的事：公司洋行裏的「花瓶」，暑天城市裏的闊老的精舍别墅（因暑天一到，大家到莫干山等處消暑去了，精舍别墅類皆重門深鎖）不都是「備而不用」？</p>
<p>講到大事上去，就是容易記起，瀋陽禍變之頃，張少帥的二百多架飛機，原也是「備而不用」的。豈知東洋人竟以爲棄之可惜，乃全數借了去，轉而應用到上海之役，把閘北炸燬成現在的荒凉景象。歐美各資本主義國家，常常有馬鈴薯小麥大荳一類的珍貴農產品，沉下海裏去，無非是「備而不用」。　　反過來說到「用而不備」的現象，也是同樣的多着呢。</p>
<p>幾多摩登女性，要到寫情書的時候，才來查字典，一般的女同學，臨到考試，十九是面澀澀的偷看書本，窺竊别人的，甚至有全權差遣秘書代勞者，這無非是「用而不備」的結果。</p>
<p>說什麽男子漢，大丈夫，在這年頭兒，多少人被榨取得貧窮不堪，肚皮兒常不得飽，不過這裏的「用而不備」，倒有一層很深刻而値得研究的意義，並非當事者的罪過。</p>
<p>雖說咱們的國以農爲本，但糧食却常常有「用而不備」的恐慌，前年遭了浩浩蕩蕩汜濫至十六省的水災，當然是要到金元國去借，但豐稔如去年，海關進口仍是糧食第一，也還須棉麥借欵來補救，現今黄河又冲堤决口，汜濫無疆了，明年眞不知怎樣度呢？荒歉也罷，豐稔也罷，總之農業國有糧食恐慌，總之是「用而不備。」一般機關衙門裏的所需的專門人才，以及工業上商業上農業上所需的科學人才，在國内隨你用望遠鏡顯微鏡照找，也總找不到勝任的人來</p>
<p>，只有挽請外人代庖的辦法，這又何嘗不是「用而不備」呵！</p>
<p>『備而不用』與「用而不備」在現中國是有着這樣多的情形，究竟怎樣？恕我也不能多說了。</p>
<h3 id="c265">就是這時候 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>

<p>丨也算是我的一葉戀愛史丨</p>
<p>就是這時候丨兩年前的初秋、習習的風吹着，微微的雨霏着，温暖的天氣，温暖的人生，我，總算也從飢餓缐上步進了生活的圈圍。</p>
<p>當我搬進初無一面之緣的Ｘ府小樓後，事實啓示着我，那不是人的生活，說得漂亮些，彷彿一部機器之於工廠主。因爲這樣，我就感到精神上的無限苦悶，每當早晚獨坐消閒的時候，尤其是深夜，靜寂的深夜。於是我犯了失眠症，於是我有了戀的動機。</p>
<p>其次也許是中了「飽暖思淫欲」的毒，有了飯吃時候的心，究竟比在飢餓綫上有些異樣了，這又無疑的是推動動機的最大原因。</p>
<p>「若是有些什麽精神上的安慰，不也好些！」</p>
<p>「若是有個把女人來往來往，不作妄想，不也可以調劑調劑生活的某一部份！」</p>
<p>我想着，呌着，這就成了我日常很少的空餘時間的自修課程。</p>
<p>一天，對過樓忽然傳來了一陣吵閙聲，間雜着一二句很熟的故鄕的駡語，靜腦一聽，才知是我的鄕親，大槪旅外有年，彷彿有些北方的語尾，也有些上海的腔白，不過究竟仔細一聽，就可斷定其籍貫丨完全不錯，是我的鄕親。</p>
<p>二層樓與二層樓相對，視線被居間的兩面門牆擋住了，只聞人語聲，不見人模樣，於是我爬上了三層樓，爲窮究竟，更上一層，便到了矖台。這時居高臨下，展開視線，一望就看透了那兒的人物種種，最惹眼的是一位十分縹緻的少奶奶模樣的姑娘在埀頭揉眼。</p>
<p>自後我便常常爬上矖台，有意無意的在那兒逗遛徘徊，這被她發覺了，起初在她的投報的「盼兮」之下，是有着「彼美人兮」的充分的「示威」之意。我知道這是女人的慣技，果然日久便不同了，有了媚眼，還有媚笑，還有媚的招呼，還有媚的情意。</p>
<p>於是我冒失的寫去第一封信。</p>
<p>没有回響，又去第二封第三封·····在第四封上得着了回音：「我已是一個不自由的人了丨」我的回信第一句便是：「不自由的人，果眞没法自由了麽」又没有回音、我算準，大槪是默認我的話了。</p>
<p>以後曬台上的默對，是我們的互通欵曲。</p>
<p>過了不久，她遇來Ｘ府玩了，而且上了我的小樓，我很私幸而又很侷侷的招呼她，她顯然有些驚異，將我的簡陋的罷飾打量了一回，接着便老瞪着我的舗蓋、然後是若有所思的靜默了一息，霎的便是：「Ｘ先生，打擾得很，再會把！」這算是她「出勤」過了我的信裏的自誇。</p>
<p>她走後，我感到無限的空虚，無限的自悔！</p>
<p>以後我办能在曬台上望見她的背身的倩影。</p>

<p>— 人心</p>
<p>文人與將軍不同。「兵不厭詐」，將軍們在「兩陣對峙」之際，不僅可以玩點「虚則實，實則虞」的騙人把戲來取勝，而且「虚虚實實」，越是會騙人，但越是能得到戰勝的榮譽。但是文人却須公開向大衆說理論道，因而便要眞實，不能欺詐；欺詐是不能使大衆眞正相信的。　　可是，在某此時候，不是一切眞話都可以說的。像目前這個年頭兒，有許多眞話就不能說：所謂：「禍從口出」，現在如誰要老老實實地任意說眞話，但同時他們又不願玩欺詐的把戲，他們知道欺詐是不使人眞正相信的。於是他們便心生一計　　　要保持不說假話的原則，同時又要没有危險。這便是近來在中國文化領域内盛行的「幽默」與「考古」的满原之所在。</p>
<p>有許多　　　　　　　　　　提倡研究甲骨文，墩煌文學，或著什未古史辨，古書考嗎？不是又有許多在努力構想什未「踢」，「推」，「拉」，「烏鴉」，「讓娘兒們來幹；」···等詎剌的誚皮的幽默話嗎？這是因爲考古，旣可認眞去了解歷史現象，站在自己的觀點上說幾句關後於占百年幾千年前的眞話，又不冒犯意外的危險，而且還可以在考古之餘，駡駡儒家的腐敗，道家的虚渺，慈禧太后的荒唐，林琴南的反勳。至於說幽默話，雖然已有眞的成分，而且有時甚至令傷到大人先生們的痛處，但因近於開玩笑，無關大體，也不致撞出來了不起的大禍。</p>
<p>自然，在「考古」和「幽默」中，文人學士們不免也要感到文化界的寂寞，於是便抽空去偵查「剽竊」，「偷剪」的事情。一但偵查到了，那便非同小可，必要各方動員起來，舉行一塲大爭大閙的辯論。然而將　　　在一旁坐坐笑道：「文人們的確满有意思！」</p>

<p>退一時之快樂，</p>
<p>貽永久之禍患，</p>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>敬有詢者，敝友裘君，年正弱冠，供職某輪船公司。以友人之介紹，得識一女性，二九年華，貌僅中姿，嗣以相聚日久，遂生戀愛，兩情繾綣，將賦白首之盟，繼而出入於娯樂之塲，終乃發生瞹昧之事；陳倉暗度，竟非一次，惟敝友對於其身家，詳細考察之後，發現她上有一母，下有三弟；家中開支，全賴其女以維持，其女進益，多爲男友所供給，因此未曾正式訂婚，僅一紙八行，虚與委蛇。後其母因敝友供給至微，發生齟齬，敝友亦憤而不與謀面。越數日，其女折箋相招，敝友不疑其他，逕趨其家。安知彼家預伏遊民，出而敲詐；卒以未逞其慾，乃扭交捕房。其女竟控强姦之罪，捕房因事無實證，未能受理，諭令出外自行料理·後雙方未有動靜，直至前日，其女女來言和。敝友因其居心險惡，後患不堪設想，亦置之不理。然常來糾纒，職業將蒙莫大影響，自　之餘，而李鄙人代詢先生。以雙方之地位而言，固應負同等之罪惡，若以法律解决，則敝友究竟有無若何罪責？務望</p>
<p>先生詳爲指敎，俾謀正當之對付也。且近來靑年，不明利害，往往逞一時之快樂，貽永久之禍患。先生勵語警鐘，未嘗不爲社會燃犀鑄鼎也。臨頴急迫，不勝盼覆。　　朱子明鐘上</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>編者按：令友裘君，與該女旣未正式結婚或訂婚，雖有曖昧情事，祇可認爲一種姦非行爲，而不發生任何身分關係。且該女年已二九，已逾承諾年齡；且當時係出兩願，自無强暴威逼等行爲。根本不能成立强姦或準强姦罪。所可慮者，卽所謂「一紙八行」中，有没有富於誘惑性的辭句耳。如其有之，則令友當負誘姦之責。倘能提出相當證件，足以證明彼此出於自願，或竟女方先有誘惑的事實，則姦非罪，亦根本不能成立矣。惟該女年祇十八，雖逾承諾年齡，但未達成年，所以無論如何，妨害家庭罪的責任，令友是無逃的。不過照來信看來，對方的母親，似有意圖利得，而放縱該女的嫌疑。現在最好設法收集此項證據，作先發制人之計，向法院提起設計敲詐之訴。否則惟有認痛托人和解。置之不理，誠有糾纒不淸，影響職業並且歸根結蒂，不免獲罪的危險。</p>

<p>第一幕生與死</p>
<p>兵士辛：因爲他們有錢，我們没有錢啊。</p>
<p>老者：是的呀，諸位老　也夠苦了，可是現在是和外國打仗，所以也就没有辦法。你們不知道，我們老百姓比你們還苦哩。你們天天總還有幾頓饅頭吃，我們連吃的都没有了呀。</p>
<p>兵士乙：你瞧我的腿，他媽的腫成這個樣子來了。</p>
<p>兵士丁：誰不是這個樣子，我比你的還要腫得利害哩，你瞧，這裏血也出來了。</p>
<p>兵士乙：說起來眞他媽的氣死人，以前打仗，總是打敗了才退，可是這一次和外國交鋒却不同樣，不過是放了幾槍，衝鋒也没有來一次，馬上就跑，一跑就跑得這麽遠，眞弄得老子莫明其妙。</p>
<p>兵士甲：那不能這樣說的。我們當然不愛打仗，最好是世界上就没有打仗這麽一回事。可是這一次怎麽樣，我們很高興的聽說是打外國，大家都殺氣衝天的跑上前線，誰知在戰壕裏還没有站上半天，馬上便是「總退却」。要說是打敗了，那未我們連日本兵也没有看着一個。　　老者：不是說前線打得頂利害嗎？今天還從這兒運回來兩汽車的死屍和傷兵哩。</p>
<p>兵士丁：噢？這可不知道。</p>
<p>兵士乙：那未那屋裏面的兩個傢伙，　是今天來的嗎？</p>
<p>兵士乙：這樣嗎？那我到要去問問他們的情形了。（進廟去）</p>
<p>老者：這樣說來，旣然不打就退，那末我們老百姓還有什麽希望呢？再過幾天，前線的兵，都退盡了，我們也就做亡國奴了。</p>
<p>兵士甲：做亡國奴嗎？那才便宜你，恐怕不多久你們都要變做砲灰了哩。　　老者：對呀！我們假如不願做亡國奴，只有一個辦法！逃，可是没有錢，逃不了，幷且又逃到那兒去呢？說一句没有志氣的話，我們最好還是預備做亡國奴罷。再不然，就祇有等死。</p>
<p>傷兵甲：（自廟内扶着士兵的肩膞緩慢的出來）心裏難過極了，還是出來</p>
<p>和諸位談談罷。（坐在樹上）</p>
<p>兵士庚：老大，你是在那兒帶花的？</p>
<p>傷兵甲：在古北口這面，隔古北口八十幾里路的地方。想起來簡直會把人氣死。我告訴你：那一次日本兵大敗一次，在一夜裏給我們打死了五百多人，再也不敢衝鋒了，儘在那裏等救兵。到晚上就用許多手電筒，像鬼火似的满山满谷的照來照去，當然是虚張聲勢。同時又用大的電光，一夜到天亮的照射，當然是怕我們偷營。白天便放大砲。這樣差不多十多天，假如我們官長下了總攻擊令，那末一定可以奪回古北口。可是老是守，老是守，一直等到日本的援兵到了，坦克車飛機大砲兩向我們進攻，我們第二道防缐又守不住了。一個炸　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　了一半多。我的脚也給炸壞了。</p>

<h3 id="c269">蘇聨最近的電影事業（下） <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>蘇聨的外交委員李維諾夫，是一個亞洲的怪傑。現蘇聨的電影事業，完全在他的扶植之下。李維諾夫的外交政策，包含著用影片來協助他的外交手腕。蘇聨的影片題材，都是富有革命背景的，這是李維諾夫對於電影要求的最低限度。</p>
<p>在蘇聨的電影界中，有一個鼎鼎大名的戲劇家柴喜。他是李維諾夫最信任的一人。他在蘇聨的影界中，是一個電影事業的主宰。大部分蘇聨影片的取材是由他採取的。雖然他從没導演過一次影片，但是蘇聨所有影片，都要經過他的斟酌。李維諾夫的製片計畫亦完全執掌在他的手中。他確是全蘇俄的電影事業中的中心人物。</p>
<p>蘇聨的電影的目的不在營利。他們所有的製片業，都是受政府補助的。他們的目的是在於宣揚蘇聨的革命。所以一張影片在政府領導之下完成了，就可以不受到像别國　檢會的留難。因此他們的製片工作是很有系統的，很有膽量的，在各處公映的電影，所收票價是極低廉的。他們的電影是大衆化的：是負有敎育使命的。</p>
<p>他們深信未來的世界戰爭是勞與資的衝突。並且說人口的增加是幾何級數，而物產的增加是算術級數，所以未來的社會問題恐怖接着就要降臨。蘇聨的影片，大半捉住了這個問題做中心，告訴大衆及顯示他們在目下所應用擇取的工作。雖然這是各帝國主義者所怕的，但是在電影敎育的原義上，各帝國主義者未嘗不加以承認。</p>
<p>蘇聨的影片非但坦白地拿勞資等問題解剖，並且很有力地拿本國的革命工作向各國宣佈。最近柴喜撰定了幾部影片，都是叙述革命工作的劇本。拿蘇聨的内部工作在銀幕上揭發，其中有一部影片劇本已撰定的是關於土耳其一九一八年時所發生獨立解放的革命戰爭，這部影片曾得土耳其政府的同意，土耳其在獨立解放之時同帝國主義抗爭，是柴喜氏所採作的主要史料。土耳其是同蘇聨有互相連合的趨勢，關於土耳其的革命，當然是蘇聨心理上默認的。蘇聨的影片擴展至如是的地步，他們的前程亦可以不言而喻了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c270">「母與子」之我見 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 興之</p>
<p>當我看過了「母與子」一片之後，我覺得這部片子由意識上講，是國產片改變陣線以後的最失敗的作品。無疑的在時代巨輪不斷的向前進行的時候，不應當有這一類富有封建思想的影片。</p>
<p>第一要知道的，就是「母與子」一片題材上的不愼，非但没有這樣巧的事實，而且編戲者根本的思想是錯誤了的（中略），我相信監獄雖然黑暗，决没有拿一個人的面目改變得故舊都不認識的能力，林晴雲（宣景琳飾）被判了十八年的監禁，出獄之後進她從前的丈夫何文超的家中去當僕人，何文超同她結合的時期在三年以上，，豈有結合了三年以上的夫婦，經過了十八年的監獄生活，何文超就不認識之理？再當晴雲殺龍兒的時候，晴雲額上的黑痣，使龍兒認出是他的母親。七歲時走散的雲兒尙能因一粒痣而認出母親，何文超何反不能認出他的前妻。並且黑痣在額上，何以雲兒看見而何文超不看見呢？這種疏忽，實在不成話說了！</p>
<h3 id="c271">「母與子」觀後感 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 嫻</p>
<p>在「母與子」中，有幾點很値得討論，㈠昇平書塲的電燈總門絕不應該可以隨便關閉。㈡中國現在還没有「女警察」，但是在這片中却有幾個女警察看守服務。㈢說明書上是晴雲在憶雲訂婚當夜就偷了文超的手槍化裝找到公達的地方槍殺他，但在畫面上，晴雲去找到公達而槍殺他，明明是在第二天的白天。㈣手槍旣是危險物决不會很隨便地扔在抽屜裏，總之，「母與子」這張片子，並没有什麽相當的價値，只是平庸的一個劇本而已。</p>
<h3 id="c272">「母與子」我評 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 湘</p>
<p>看過了「母與子」後，無疑的是失望了！劇情本很牽强又加以巧事太多，但也有幾個鏡頭不錯，有些地方很有商榷的必要，現在略爲談談。</p>
<p>晴雲旣和文超感情很好，在她被刦後，不能因痛惜愛子和想感化孔令武一般人，便安心住在匪窟。至少應該有一二次携兒脫逃又被發覺捉回，然後才勉强住下。這樣對於她的個怪，使人們有更進一層的認識，知道她並非是個「忘情於文超」和「日與匪人同流合汚」的人。</p>
<p>劇情方面，一個脅從的女子，不見得有十八年徒刑的罪。監獄囚犯的衣帽，不應全用洋碼（羅馬數字），應改爲中碼或華字和洋碼併用。旅館裏發生了槍聲，就應該有人來調查，事實上是不會隔了這許多時候才有人爬進房去察看的。以外還有何文超家裏傭人臥室太考究了！公達受傷後太鎭靜，並且襯衫上没有看見血蹟。這都是不通之處。（下略）</p>

<p>關於本片演出，錯誤之處，不知多少，其中最大的一點，即是寫睛雲之失身匪窟，原爲不得已，過後發覺被逮，如果晴雲能說出原因，丨這當然可以呌文超來作證丨她决不致被判執行十八年的徒刑，乃晴雲竟没有想到這層，伏伏貼貼地下獄，我想：假設晴雲是一個稍具有理智的女子，她决不會如此愚笨，這不是她自己甘心下獄而何？當然，這一段情節，是本片最重的關鍵，如使晴雲被釋，「母與子」全劇也就完全解散，於是編劇者只好做到如此，而晴雲乃得吃官司，因此，「母與子」全片亦得大功告成！然而這種事情，在觀衆看來，怎說得過去？</p>

<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>自從德國的「女性」最近造成了電影界的新紀錄之後，各國的電影界莫不感覺到一部影片全用女演員的可能。於是好萊塢也不甘落後，而有倣照「女性」一類全部女演員之影片籌畫，於是所謂分性制SegregstionoftheSexes的理想，現在就成爲電影界最時髦的問題了。好萊塢大部份的人，以爲分性制是一種改變千篇一律的製片方法，轉換一下口味的對向。他們都以爲分性制的製片法是一種很有興味的，全少亦不致於完全失敗。</p>
<p>好萊塢開始攝製分性制影片的，現在巳有派拉蒙公司的新片「五千萬女人」50MillionWomeno牠是一部完全女演</p>
<p>員的影片。裏面的主角共有十五位。甜姐兒耐　卡洛富有肉的誘引力的卡洛郎白及愛麗遜斯凱潑華絲AlisonSkipworth等都在其中。同時有一部呌做GoldDivers的是一部完全男演員演的影片。牠叙述一隻輪船在海洋中遇險而拯救搭客時所發生的事情。現在派拉蒙當局尙在徴集演員，大槪亦有十幾個有名望的男明星担任主角之職。合演的男子終</p>
<p>在幾百個人左右。</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司是分性制的導者。自從「五千萬女人」一片攝製之後，好萊塢對於分性制的製片都感到異常的興趣。狐狸公司及米高梅亦有攝製分性制影片之說。華納第一國家聨藝等亦擬攝取分性制的影片環球公司已在積極籌備。分性制的影片立刻時髦起來了。</p>

<p>那天晚上，因爲塞爾維亞的獨立，杜升特爲在家裏開了一個慶祝大會。當賓客满堂的時候，大家都覺得杜升已不是往日和藹可親的人了。他豎著臉，心事重重，他將日中所懷疑的事和他往日一切不經心的形迹，一一配合起來，覺得蛛絲馬跡，都可以證實奇薩愛琳娜的罪名。到了宴會的中間，新軍法官邦託來了。他來是爲要得到一位官長的簽字於搜查證上，好去搜查幾個國敵的住宅，而奇薩的名字，亦赫然在那國敵的名單上。賓客們紛紛談論着，說搜查的人要陷害一個人是很容易的，而軍法槍斃又是一個很便堂的處决方法，杜升在旁冷眼看着愛琳娜的面色上的變轉，他裝得不在乎似的，靜等愛琳娜的忍耐不住了來求他去警告奇薩。他很冷酷地等事實來證明他妻子的姦情，他想那是萬萬逃避不了的，愛琳娜亦恐怕心太急了，露出破綻，所以亦時時注意着杜升的態率。最後杜升吩咐預備馬車，但忽然妒心燃燒起來，又遲延着不去了。愛琳娜終久是一個女子，她再也不能支持了，她突然不顧一切的，如痴如狂的，哀求杜升去營救奇薩。杜升的暴怒立時一發而不可遏，他立誓不管。他說他們就是要將奇薩絞死，他亦决不伸一個指頭去救他。他將馬車亦打發走了。</p>
<p>愛琳娜一言不發，面色發靑，他掙扎開了他丈夫的把持，一直向外奔出去了。她在矌野的田原上，向着奇薩的住所奔着。但是愛琳娜見了奇薩，還没有講幾句話，杜升一經趕到了。他似凶神一般咒駡着奇薩，說他是人面獸心，衣冠禽獸。他儘問着，「這件事是什麽時候發生的，你什麽時候得到她的？」奇薩很鎭靜地喊着：「上帝救我吧，這事是完全没有的。」愛琳娜亦聲辯着：「没有的，杜升，這事是没有的。」杜升哼着道：没有？哦，我明白了。「</p>
<p>還没有上手呢。不過接接吻。摸索摸索，在我的背後。還不夠呢。還要進一步呢。」愛琳娜突然地喊着：「不許再說了。」杜升道：「那都是没有的事。」杜升道：「没有的事？難道你們一些事没有嗎。接吻都没有接過嗎？你看着我，回答我！愛琳娜不能回答他。杜升將她把持着，搖着，但她一言不發。杜升自制之力喪失了，兩個男子扭着打了起來，各以畢生之力，要制對方的死命（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the post-military affairs of Chahar Province, due to the refusal of Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, and Liu Guitang's troops to submit, Song Zheyuan personally went to Zhangbei a few days ago to find a way to meet with Fang and Ji. He personally conveyed the central government's policy for handling the aftermath in Chahar. However, Ji and Fang avoided meeting him. Later, Song sent Zhang Yunrong and Cheng Xiwen to meet with Fang and persuade him, but to no avail. Fang is now leading his troops to Dushikou, attempting to join up with Liu. Ji is leading his troops north of Zhangbei. In total, the three units number no more than several thousand. Should they be difficult to subdue, the authorities have made considerable preparations to deal with them. The current authorities have already ordered Song Zheyuan to be responsible for handling the matter. The 29th Army's two divisions, led by Zhao Deng and Liu Ruming, are expected to fully enter Chahar within the next few days. The issue of Ji and Fang's troops, with their small numbers and lack of weapons, should not be difficult to resolve. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu led over a thousand troops to Dushikou, planning to go to Chicheng to join forces with Liu Guitang. However, along the way, Ruan Xuanwu brought back a significant number of soldiers. Fang's unit has only a few hundred remaining, making their strength too weak to pose a problem. Song also sent personnel to catch up with Fang and earnestly persuade him not to take reckless risks. Fang's unit should be resolved soon. Ji's unit is currently moving from Zhangbei towards Shichang, numbering over a thousand troops, and has not yet submitted. Jiang Bocheng will return to Beiping within two or three days. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to telegrams from Song Zheyuan and Jiang Bocheng in Zhangjiakou, all the troops stationed in Chahar have responded to the call and sent representatives to Zhangjiakou for a meeting. On the spot, they announced Jiang and He's peaceful intentions, engaged in candid discussions, and agreed on demobilization and reorganization measures. The representatives were very satisfied and expressed their obedience. They were also given supplies and funds to be taken back to their posts. However, this morning, a telephone report was received from Zhangbei County stating that Fang and Ji had led their troops away on the fifteenth night. At the same time, Liu Guitang sent a telegram with an unclear attitude. In short, Liu, Fang, and Ji seem to have other plans and may be difficult to subdue. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>A reporter, taking advantage of Song Zheyuan's inspection tour of Zhangbei, made a special trip to the north on the afternoon of the 27th to inspect the area. It was very desolate, and many incomplete slogans remained on the streets. When Fang and Ji were in Zhangbei, there were twenty-eight command headquarters in the city, and the daily supply of provisions reached 30,000 catties, which greatly exhausted the people. Now that Fang has gone to Dushikou, which is about two hundred li away from Zhangbei, the future handling of Fang's troops and Fang himself will be discussed entirely by telephone. Ji's troops are very small and can be eliminated. Many soldiers from Fang and Ji's troops were seen along the way. The autumn wheat is ripe and a bumper harvest is expected. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that Fang Zhenwu's troops have been resolved step by step, but the government has not yet made a concrete decision on the form of Fang going abroad for inspection. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan returned to Zhangjiakou on the 28th. Because Fang Zhenwu went to Dushikou ahead of schedule, and Ji Hongchang also went to Guyuan, they did not meet. Therefore, no results have been achieved in the reorganization of Fang and Ji's troops. Jiang Bocheng will postpone his return to Beiping because he still needs to stay in Chahar to assist with the aftermath. (28th Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed Jiang and Wang, stating that, according to a telegram from Director Xiong Binrang, Zhang Yunrong and Ruan Xuanwu have arrived in Zhang. They have been earnestly discussing the idea of giving Fang a title to go abroad, and he will be responsible for his subordinates. There are no objections. It is decided that they will return to Zhangbei tomorrow to consult with Fang. Shao Yun is determined to have his subordinates be led by Lei Zhongtian first, and listen to Chairman Song's reorganization, etc. Respectfully reported, He Yingqin kowtows. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Zhangjiakou, Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang failed to reach an agreement with Song Zheyuan. They are now united with Liu Guitang. Zhang HaiPeng has occupied Guyuan, and Ji's army has retreated to Baochang. Song Zheyuan has sent troops to besiege Fang and Ji. Fang and Ji's army are trapped in a dilemma, and may be disbanded and disarmed. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

At 2:00 PM, a review meeting was held. At 3:00 PM, the second plenary session was held to discuss 23 proposals from various parties and 2 motions proposed on the spot. In addition to those merged and transferred to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission for reference or discretionary handling, the following resolutions were made: (1) The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has already started the breach-plugging project, and the commission should actively proceed with it, and the provincial governments should do their best to assist. (2) The Yellow River levee should be raised and thickened with reference to the highest water level of this year. All river embankments should be repaired completely before the next flood season. All private embankments should be repaired with reference to the standards of the main levee, and the provincial governments should supervise the repairs, which should be completed before the next flood season. The river and lake embankments affected by the breaches and flooding of the Yellow River should be given priority for emergency repairs in the local area, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission should provide as much assistance as possible. (3) Request the Executive Yuan to immediately allocate the remaining funds of the 500,000 yuan that were resolved to be transferred, excluding the 50,000 yuan that has already been received, and use them as soon as possible to plug the breaches. Furthermore, request an urgent allocation of 10 million yuan from the national treasury to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to handle the plugging and repair projects. (4) The plugging and repair projects should make full use of civilian laborers and military engineers, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission should request the provincial governments and military authorities to provide as much assistance as possible. (5) Request the central government to add the heads of the construction departments of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces as ex officio members of the Yellow River Conservancy Committee of the Six Provinces Flood Control Conference. (6) Recommend to the Executive Yuan that the central government establish a Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to handle disaster relief matters. The Six Provinces Flood Control Conference was originally scheduled to last for two days, but because there were not many motions proposed on the spot, it closed on the evening of the 28th.

<p>(Nanjing) The Huaibei Inspection Branch recently launched a trial of Anqing shipping (96,000 dan) to transport high-quality salt from Huaibei as a pioneer. Once successful, a permanent quota will be determined. However, Huainan has become a de facto abandoned landing site. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of laborers on the bank are in jeopardy, causing panic. Once unemployed, it will have a significant impact on public order and the prosperity of the market.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources in the Jiangxi Bandit Suppression, the Guangdong Army has captured Anyuan and Xunwu, making steady progress. In order to avoid the main forces, the bandits fled to western Fujian. Although they managed to seize some food, they suffered heavy losses due to the 19th Route Army splitting its forces to encircle and suppress them. It is difficult for them to hold their ground for long. Therefore, they have recently retreated to their old nest in central Jiangxi, hoping to prolong their survival. Recently, the bandit troops have been increasingly collapsing internally due to the Guangdong Army blockading southern Jiangxi. Therefore, they are attempting to break out. Chen Jitang received the report and increased troop deployment, taking advantage of the situation to launch a swift attack on Huichang, catching the bandits off guard and annihilating them in one fell swoop. Currently, in addition to ordering the three divisions of Huang Zhiwen, Wang Zanbin, and Zhang Meixin to concentrate between Xunwu and Anyuan, making thorough and meticulous arrangements, he has also transferred the Second Division's Ye Zhao unit from Xinfeng to join the joint defense, preparing for a full-scale attack on Huichang. He has allowed the First Division's Li Zhenqiu unit, in the southwest corner of Yudu, to move into Xinfeng to be in charge of security and monitor the movements of the bandit troops in that direction. Ye's unit has already prepared to depart from Xinfeng. Li's division and Li's regiment have arrived at Wangmudu to take over the defense. As for the San'nan area, it has been decided to transfer the Fourth Independent Division's Deng Longguang unit to garrison and defend it, and to coordinate all matters. Deng's division has received orders, has recently been replenished, and is preparing to mobilize in the near future. Currently, Yu Hanmou, the First Army Commander and Commander of the First Column, will personally inspect and command all matters in the Ganzhou, Nankang, and Xinfeng areas after the deployment of the various units is completed, since his division headquarters has been ordered to relocate.

<p>(Nanjing) A large part of Xinglong County protrudes outside the pass. There is a well-known gold mine in the Dadongliushui and Xiaodongliushui areas, which belongs to the Hebei Provincial Industrial Department. After the new county magistrate, Li Ying, took office, he immediately sent personnel to take over. The Japanese side regarded this as a violation of the truce agreement and lodged a serious protest with us. Our side is currently studying the matter and has not yet replied. If our side is fully prepared at the various passes of the Great Wall, we can contact and take them over. There is also no problem in the Dushan area. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that the Xinglong County issue was caused by the county magistrate Li Ying being too active. Four-fifths of the county protrudes outside the Great Wall. Li wanted to take it over, so the Japanese side regarded it as a violation of the truce agreement and lodged a serious protest with us. Currently, the authorities have notified Li to retreat inside the Great Wall and temporarily reside in Malanyu. The negotiation method will be determined after Huang Fu returns to Beiping. The bandit situation in eastern Luan is very rampant recently. I met with He Yingqin this morning to discuss the bandit suppression matter. The general plan has been decided and needs to be discussed with Yu Xuezhong after he returns north before proceeding. The Japanese side has expressed its willingness to assist in the bandit suppression. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>President Wang's Report</p>
<h3 id="e30">Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>And the Process of Reforming "Official Document Processing"</p>
<p>Diplomatic Policy Consistent with Domestic Policy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Administrative Yuan's weekly memorial meeting on the 28th, attended by over 200 people including ministers and officials of all departments, President Wang presided and reported on the issue of diplomatic policy and the reforms in official document processing. He stated that before reporting, he had something to declare: "Every time I give a report at the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, or the Administrative Yuan's weekly memorial meeting, it is either recorded by myself or by comrades, and after I have proofread and revised it, it is then released by the Central News Agency. The reports made on Mondays are usually published in the newspapers on Tuesdays. I am responsible for these drafts. However, evening newspapers in the capital often publish based on other records, which have not been corrected by me, leading to discrepancies from the original meaning. And because these are published first, various news agencies use them as a basis for dissemination at home and abroad, spreading inaccuracies. Although the original draft can be published the next day for correction, the inaccuracies of the previous day are enough to cause considerable unnecessary misunderstanding. Now, I solemnly declare once again that I am not responsible for any records that have not been proofread and revised by myself. Today, I have two things to report.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of diplomatic policy. Diplomatic policy is decided by the Central Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs merely executes the policies decided by the Central Government. The policies decided by the Central Government were stated in a telegraph sent jointly with Chairman Chiang, the most important meaning of which is that the people of the whole country must painfully and clearly recognize that China is currently in a position of accumulated weakness, not only weak but also in a position of being infringed upon. This position is an unprecedented national crisis for China. However, since the 19th century, there have been many countries and nations in the world that have encountered such national crises. Some have perished, while others have struggled to survive to this day. The form of national crisis varies from country to country, but the common ground is to clearly recognize one's own position in order to seek self-salvation and survival. There is no need to panic or be indignant. For example, France after the Franco-Prussian War and Germany after World War I are examples. France's famous saying at the time was, 'Keep it in your heart at all times, but not on your lips.' Germany was even more patient and hardworking, and it still is today. I once heard someone say, 'If we train 3,000 airplanes, we will definitely be able to take revenge.' This is simply nonsense. Do you have 3,000 airplanes now? Will they allow you to calmly train 3,000 airplanes? When you calmly train 3,000 airplanes, they will have already trained 4,000 or 5,000. What then? If the above three questions cannot be answered, then it is better not to say such nonsense. The ancients once said, 'He who has the intention of plotting against others and makes it known to others is in danger.' I don't mean it that way, because we only seek self-salvation and survival, not plotting against others. Perhaps we won't even have the time or opportunity to achieve self-salvation and survival. We should not slacken our determination as long as there is a breath of life left. Plotting against others is out of the question, and even more so is trying to collude with or seek help from others. I once said, 'Without considerable national strength, we cannot talk about resistance, nor can we talk about friendship.' In other words, 'Only by surviving can we coexist; without surviving, we will not be able to coexist.' Now, some people talk about a pro-A faction, and others talk about a pro-B faction. This is even more nonsense than before. The collusion on one side has not yet taken effect, while the conflict on the other side has already shown results. If we can clearly recognize our current position, we will never take such a risky move. We must know that our current position is like being critically ill. Apart from treating the symptoms, all food should be light. If we suddenly take tonics, it will not only not help the illness but may even hasten death. Colluding with or seeking help from others is like taking tonics before the illness has subsided. What could be more dangerous than this? Therefore, our diplomatic policy today is completely consistent with our domestic policy. The first sentence is to develop the people's strength and develop the people's productive capacity. The second sentence is also to develop the people's strength and develop the people's productive capacity. However, the purpose of development is to achieve self-salvation and survival. Therefore, we must have a detailed and prudent distinction and choice between what is urgent and what is not. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The second thing is the Administrative Yuan's reform of official document processing.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of official documents, I feel that past malpractices have had a great impact on administrative efficiency. Therefore, on June 20, at the Administrative Yuan's meeting, I proposed convening a review meeting to plan reforms. The reviewers included 14 agencies from the Administrative Yuan's Secretariat, Political Affairs Department, and various ministries. It lasted more than two months, with five meetings. All reviewers were able to work tirelessly, continuing their research under the scorching heat. The preliminary work was finally completed last Tuesday. This is something I truly admire.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to reform the past procedures for handling official documents? Because administration is a specialized skill. Administration values efficiency the most, and to improve efficiency, we must modernize and rationalize administration. This cannot be achieved overnight. However, if we want politics to take on the new mission of the new era, we must first pay attention to various administrative reforms. Official document processing is one aspect of this.</p>
<p>The first drawback of past official document processing procedures is "delay." The reason for the delay is that the people handling the documents like to make them travel for a long time. Long-term travel can be divided into two types. One is going in circles, from agency A to agency B, from agency B to agency C, from agency C to agency D, and then back from agency D to agency A. This kind of circular travel is meaningless. The reason is that each agency procrastinates, leading to this phenomenon. The second is lingering along the way. A document is sent to agency A, where it is arbitrarily delayed for a few days, and then forwarded to agencies B, C, and D, each of which does the same. Things that could be resolved in one or two days are often delayed for one or two weeks or one or two months. The reason is that when agencies encounter official matters that cannot be delayed, they still refuse to take responsibility and handle them immediately, leading to this phenomenon. The reason why these two phenomena occur is entirely because the methods of official document processing are not reasonable, so those who are unwilling to handle things are happy not to handle them, and those who are willing to handle things are unable to do so. My first feeling was that at one meeting, I remembered an official matter that had been reviewed by various departments but had not been replied to for a long time. When I asked about the reason, I found out that because the nature of the matter required joint review by departments A, B, and C, the document was sent from the Administrative Yuan to the three departments, passing through the hands of clerks, section chiefs, secretaries, and counselors, and finally to the vice ministers and ministers, which took several days. It took several more days for the three departments to send out reviewers. It took several more days for the reviewers to report the results of their review to their superiors. It took several more days for the three departments to draft a reply to the Administrative Yuan. This already took two or three weeks. If the clerks arbitrarily delayed it from the beginning, it would take even more days. If one of the three departments could not send out a reviewer on time, it would take even more days. If the reviewers still had to ask their superiors for instructions, it would take even more days. Thus, two or three weeks or even two or three months would not be surprising. We realized that this method of long-term travel would ruin everything invisibly, so we reformed it immediately. For example, at the Yuan meeting on Tuesday, a certain official matter is assigned to departments A, B, and C for joint review, and personnel from the Yuan's Secretariat and Political Affairs Department are also assigned to participate, with a deadline of Friday of the same week to hold a review meeting at the Yuan. The reviewers obtain the opinions of their superiors in advance and attend the review. If the opinions are the same, the case is reviewed immediately, and it can be completed within a week. Sometimes the review opinions are not entirely the same, so a second review meeting is scheduled. It doesn't matter if a third, fourth, or fifth meeting is held. This is progress and meaningful, unlike long-term travel that is not progressive and meaningless. After we reformed this one official matter, we proceeded to reform all other similar official matters. In short, we changed from slow to fast, and the method is not to be perfunctory but to proceed responsibly. Because of responsible progress, the bad habits of going in circles and lingering along the way can be eliminated, and official documents will not suffer from long-term travel. This is the first point of reforming the procedures for handling official documents.</p>
<p>The second drawback of past official document processing procedures is "repetition." Many documents that do not need to be replied to are replied to as a matter of routine because there is no standard for not replying, which serves no other purpose than to expand the sales of paper stores. Now that we have set a standard for not replying to official documents, we can save a lot of time and resources.</p>
<p>The third point of reforming official document processing procedures is to use punctuation. Some people think this is unnecessary, but they don't know that without punctuation, the sentence structure is unclear, making approval difficult and reading prone to errors. At meetings, reading documents often leaves the reader confused and the listener baffled due to unclear sentence structure. Although it is more complicated for the person drafting the document to use punctuation, the time saved by the dozens of people who review the document is actually greater. Not only can it make official documents easier to review, but it can also avoid many unnecessary errors. I remember a story about a son who sent eight mooncakes to his father and wrote in the letter, "Sending eight mooncakes for father's use." Because there was no punctuation, it was originally "Sending eight mooncakes, for father's use." His father read it as "Sending eight mooncakes for father's use," and became suspicious, saying, "Eight fathers? I am one. Where can I find the other seven?" This is of course a joke, but there are actually similar jokes in judicial litigation cases. In the past, after a man's son died, he sent his daughter-in-law back to her parents' home in Ning and made a written statement saying, "You are allowed to go home and marry, but you are not allowed to come back and serve my parents." It was originally "You are allowed to go home and marry, but you are not allowed to come back and serve my parents." Later, a dispute arose, and it was read as "You are allowed to go home, but you are not allowed to marry and come back to serve my parents," and the meaning was completely reversed. These are all the drawbacks of not using punctuation. Although this is not a common occurrence, it shows the importance of punctuation.</p>
<p>The fourth point is official document inspection. Official documents are not only afraid of delay but also of being missed. This reform has strict inspection regulations to prevent official documents from being delayed or missed.</p>
<p>The fifth point is file organization. Because the previous methods of handling files were not good, the responsible officials often neglected the content of the cases and could not find them for reference. Now, there are regulations for setting up a general inspection card to allow the highest-level officials to know the entire content, like a library catalog, and the organization methods are set up to make it easy to check and find.</p>
<p>The above five points can be said to be the key points of this reform of official document processing. As for the detailed items, the regulations have been drafted, and those who participated in this review meeting can explain them to their colleagues in detail. Today, I am only briefly mentioning one or two to draw your attention. This reform only involves the scope of processing procedures and is only a starting point. As for the fundamental transformation of the official document format, we must continue to pay attention to it in order to achieve the final goal. This is what I hope for from my colleagues in the Yuan and all officials in the various ministries. Finally, there is one more point that I hope for from my colleagues. As I just said, making official documents travel for a long time is a common problem among officials at all levels. But in addition to this problem, there is an even bigger problem, which is to imprison official matters forever. Only the superiors have this power. A superior can approve, reject, revise, or review an official matter. These are all progressive. The only thing that should not be done is to neither reject nor revise nor submit for review, but to stuff it in the drawer of the desk. That is not progressive. The document is then imprisoned. This kind of imprisonment can last for a few weeks, a few months, or even indefinitely. That is why it is said to be imprisoned forever. This kind of imprisonment is not progressive. I have a belief about official matters: progress. Progress can be good or bad. Not progressing seems to be neither good nor bad, but everything is ruined invisibly, which can be said to be purely bad and absolutely unacceptable. I ask all my colleagues that if I ever imprison an official document, you must protest to me. Although the superior has authority, it can only be used for progressive purposes such as approving, rejecting, revising, and reviewing, and not for non-progressive purposes. I am deeply remorseful and want to remove these malpractices. Therefore, I sincerely ask all my colleagues to work together to remove these malpractices. These malpractices exist in all agencies. It is the fault of the superiors, not the fault of the subordinates. But if the subordinates constantly protest, then the superiors can at least commit fewer sins. This is the last thing I hope for from all my colleagues. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>Duan Xipeng: Self-Salvation and Self-Strengthening</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong: Yellow River Flood</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 93rd Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 28th, attended by approximately 600 people including Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Li Jingzhai, Duan Xipeng, Hong Ludong, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Huang Jichen, and staff. Chen Guofu presided, and Duan Xipeng reported, stating that the environment China is currently facing is unprecedented in history, with internal disasters such as floods, droughts, and communist bandits, and external pressures from strong neighbors encroaching on our land and resources. Looking around the world, all countries are taking a narrow-minded nationalistic approach for their own rights, increasing armaments, raising tariffs, and engaging in extreme reaction. If these contradictions cannot be resolved, their impact on our country's future will be enormous. Therefore, our country's future encounters will be even worse than today. Our fundamental solution is not to ally with A or ally with B, but to be in a proactive position and seek a path of self-salvation and self-determination. Currently, we should pay attention to creating a good political order and strengthening national power. All comrades should firmly believe in the spirit and methods of our party's doctrine, seek new understanding, and lead the people to achieve the goal of self-salvation and self-strengthening. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 28th, attended by approximately 400 people including Yu Youren, Wang Yongbin, Huang Musong, Wei Huai, and National Government staff. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Shao Yuanchong reported on the Yellow River flood, stating that the Yellow River is the birthplace of our country's culture and the area of abundant agricultural production in ancient times. However, in modern times, it has become a major problem for our country. Because the Yellow River has breached its banks and changed course many times, and the Yellow River water carries sediment, it is not suitable for irrigation and is prone to flooding, making it impossible to contain. But according to experts, the Yellow River water carries no more than 10% sediment, and the rest is only yellow soil, which is suitable for planting. If it can be utilized, it will not only be harmless but also beneficial. In the past, those who managed the river only sought to prevent breaches and protect against them, without seeking to dredge and guide the source, allowing it to flood at will. In recent years, with the development of science, human power can conquer nature. The Netherlands is a country that seeks excellence in water conservancy, boasting that "God created the sea, and the Dutch created the land." But we use extremely outdated methods to manage the Yellow River, so it is appropriate that we do not see its benefits and only see its harms. In recent years, the central government has not neglected water conservancy, but it has been managed separately by river basin, resulting in as many as six or seven water conservancy agencies, which cannot be unified in command, resulting in twice the effort for half the results. Recently, the central government decided to unify the national water conservancy agencies and make overall plans, which may be effective. Although floods are caused by natural disasters, human power can control them. I am making this report based on my personal feelings and ask those who manage the river to seek fundamental governance strategies and use scientific methods to harness this great natural force, guiding it to irrigate farmland, so that the provinces along the river can all become fertile areas, which will be of great benefit to the national economy, people's livelihood, and national culture. I also hope that national water conservancy can be planned as a whole to achieve the ideal results. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 28th on the Jiang'an Wheel from Xun, to prepare for the Yellow River flood relief. Xu said that the Yellow River flood has affected nearly 40 counties in the provinces of Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, affecting over 2 million people. He has submitted a request to the Yuan for immediate relief, which was accepted by the review committee convened by the Administrative Yuan last Saturday. It is planned to release immediate relief funds on the 28th, along with the 1 million yuan previously requested by the committee for Shaanxi and other provinces. However, due to the exhaustion of the national treasury, it is difficult to raise cash, so it is tentatively planned to issue public bonds to provide relief, which will be decided after discussion at the Yellow River flood relief meeting to be convened on the 30th. He will stay in Nanjing for two or three days and then go to Shanghai to assist in raising funds. The report that he will be transferred to head the judiciary is completely unfounded.

<p>Office Expenses of Each County Reduced by 20%</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu issued a handwritten order today, effective from August, reducing the provincial government's office expenses by 3,000 per month, the office expenses of each department by 500 per month, and the monthly salaries of civil servants earning more than 50 yuan by 20%. The office expenses of each county will also be reduced by 20% for a period of five months. In addition, effective from September, the number of public security bureaus and militia in the disaster areas will be reduced by half, and the construction and education fees will be suspended. The monthly salaries of the mayor and staff in the district will be reduced by half for a period of six months in order to save funds for disaster relief. A circular was also issued stating that the Yellow River breach and flooding have turned the counties in western Shandong into a vast swamp. All prevention and relief efforts require huge sums of money. At a time when the people's livelihood is declining, it is difficult to add to the burden. The only way is to reduce spending to supplement the funds. In addition to the provincial Department of Industry, which has been decided by the political conference to be abolished to save funds, the counties should also earnestly reduce government spending in view of the heavy disaster situation to economize and meet urgent needs.

<p>Shandong Western Flood Disaster Committee Appeals</p>
<h3 id="e34">Allocate Large Sums for Immediate Relief <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Shandong Western Flood Disaster Relief Committee telegraphed Lin Wang Jiang Wenri, stating that the Yellow River breach has spread to western Shandong, with the counties of Heze, Juye, Zhang, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Dingtao, Chengwu, Yanggu, Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, Yutai, as well as Caozhou and Puyang, all becoming swamps, with houses washed away and people displaced. Those who died in the water were carried away by the waves, and no one collected their rotting corpses. Those who were fortunate enough to survive were all sleeping in the open air and exposed to the elements, without security for the morning and evening. The pain and misery were truly unbearable to witness. As the autumn wind intensifies and diseases gradually spread, the only hope for survival for the dying disaster victims lies in the current emergency relief. It is important that the central government has dispatched experts to Shandong by plane to conduct surveys and plan the fundamental project of breaching the river. However, relief efforts cannot be delayed, otherwise, by the time the plans are made and consultations are held, the breach will not have been closed, and the victims will have all died. The members of this committee are concerned about their hometown and cannot bear to watch from the sidelines. We are making a desperate appeal, which is not like the groaning of someone without illness. The Shandong Provincial Government and various charitable organizations of the Relief Committee have successively allocated more than one million yuan for emergency relief. However, this is only a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. We admire your compassion and concern for the people and dare to send a special telegram to appeal to you to allocate a large sum of money for immediate relief to save the lives of the people.

<h3 id="e36">Welcoming Song <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>By Zi</p>
<p>Finance Minister and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, is returning home from Europe and will arrive in Shanghai today. Since leaving the country on April 18th, Mr. Song has traveled from the United States to Europe, spending more than four months abroad, visiting various important countries. His formal mission was to participate in the Washington Conference and attend the World Economic Conference. However, what we can actually know he has achieved is the establishment of a $50 million USD cotton and wheat loan in the United States and the technical cooperation negotiations with the League of Nations in Europe. There are many different opinions about the advantages and disadvantages of these two matters for China, and it is difficult to make a quick judgment. Their major relationship to China's economy in the future, and the impact on politics and diplomacy, is something that ordinary people can imagine. Will Mr. Song be able to use this loan and cooperation well to build China, or will the results not be as some people fear? The matter is still unpredictable, but it seems that there is no doubt that the people of the country have good intentions towards Mr. Song upon his return to the country.</p>
<p>The cotton and wheat loan is 50 million USD, equivalent to more than 200 million in national currency, which is a huge foreign debt. In view of the past uses of foreign debt, the people of the country have both joy and worry about the success of this loan. The authorities have repeatedly stated that it will be used in the production sector in order to save China's backward production industry. However, this still fails to fully dispel the doubts of the worriers. Now that Mr. Song has returned, how will he make the people of the country understand his policies and be relieved?</p>
<p>Technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations has been going on for three years. Mr. Song's trip to Europe this time has allowed it to be completed. The event itself is already past the discussion stage. It is only that the Japanese, who are hostile to China, are jealous and hateful, creating dangerous rumors of international co-management. The international situation after the failure of the Economic Conference also does not allow the people of the country to deeply believe in "non-political" resolutions. Mr. Song has been in charge of cooperation with the League of Nations for three years, and now that he has returned successfully, will he be able to concretely announce the plans for taking advantage and avoiding harm for the cooperation?</p>
<p>Mr. Song's return this time is being closely watched by China's enemies. On the reverse side, this has become a factor in most of the people of the country expressing good feelings towards Mr. Song. We sincerely hope that Mr. Song will be able to maintain the good feelings that the people of the country have for him in the future.</p>

<p>Seeking Ways to Resolve Disputes Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Chinese Representative Refuses to Issue Declaration Guaranteeing the Puppet State</p>
<h3 id="e38">Peng Fu <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>People at the Pacific Society today admitted that Chinese and Japanese representatives have held secret talks here many times, trying to draft a way to resolve the disputes between China and Japan. Although none of the representatives have the power to make binding guarantees on behalf of the government, it is believed that if a basis can be found, even a temporary agreement can be seriously considered in Nanjing and Tokyo. It is said that the result of the talks was the creation of several informal agreements, which have been tentatively agreed upon. However, the Chinese representative refused to agree to issue a general declaration mutually guaranteeing the integrity of the territory, as this would be tantamount to guaranteeing the current situation in Manchuria. As for the Pacific Society itself, it is happy that both sides have this kind of talk, because if it can lead to a final agreement, the association will have an outstanding achievement. It is said that the key figures in the association had already proposed this kind of talk before the representatives departed for the meeting in Peng Fu. (Guomin telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>After Mr. Cai Song returns home</p>
<h3 id="e39">Our Country's Foreign Policy <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Closely Monitors</p>
<p>Unease Felt Especially Regarding League of Nations Cooperation with Our Country</p>
<p>The Eastern Daily Predicts an Economic War May Be Unavoidable</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry authorities are paying close attention to how Song Ziwen's return to the country, after achieving many successes during his travels to European and American countries, will ultimately affect the National Government's policy towards Japan. Their views are as follows: ㈠ Song Ziwen, having obtained political and economic assistance from European and American countries, was refused permission to land in Japan while en route home. This act is highly noteworthy. ㈠ The dispute between China and Japan in the League of Nations has been resolved due to Japan's withdrawal from the League. At this time, requesting assistance from the League would only provoke Japan. Moreover, the engagement of Dr. Leith-Ross to come to China requires Japan's close attention. However, there is no need for excessive action regarding Song's personal activities at the moment. If the National Government continues its policy towards Japan after Song's return, Japan should adopt the most appropriate measures. Therefore, there is a widespread emphasis on a serious attitude to monitor the development of the situation. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communication Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Song consistently refused to meet with Japanese reporters within Japanese territorial waters. The Eastern Daily comments on the situation after Finance Minister Song's return to China, stating that while Finance Minister Song was still in the United States, Huang Fu, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek had already convened in Lushan to discuss policies towards Japan. The situation in North China will not undergo any changes due to Song's return. Considering the future of Japan's domestic economy, Finance Minister Song, having secured support from Europe and America, may be even more determined to wage an economic war against Japan upon his return, raising tariffs and enacting new anti-dumping tariff laws to initiate a more intense tariff war with Japan. This kind of policy may be difficult to avoid. As for armed resistance, the Finance Ministry under Song is unlikely to advocate for reckless action. However, regarding an economic war, Japanese goods facing challenges from all sides, resulting in greater economic hardship, can be considered an expected outcome.

<p>(Dalian) It is rumored that the Soviet Union has dispatched five female political police officers to Changchun to gather information. These individuals are all physically fit and beautiful, and have all studied Chinese and Japanese in Khabarovsk or Chita, in order to probe secret matters from various Japanese and "Manchu" sources.

<p>Japanese Cabinet Seeks Aid from Political Parties</p>

<p>President of Kokumin Dōmei Conspires to Slightly Oppose the Party</p>
<p>Seiyūkai Decides on National Policy Cooperation Direction</p>
<h3 id="e44">Yokohama <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Prime Minister Saitō, returning from Hayama to Tokyo, visited Adachi, the president of Kokumin Dōmei, at the Hasseiden Hall in Honmoku, Yokohama, at 8:00 a.m. today. He reported on the progress of his meetings with the presidents of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, and expressed his hope that Kokumin Dōmei would also assist the government with a spirit of national unity. President Adachi questioned him, asking whether he had concrete plans for national unity to overcome the extraordinary situation. The Prime Minister replied that he did not have any yet, but would create them in the future. President Adachi then expressed his personal opinion, saying that when he was the Minister of Communications in the past, the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, who opposed his views, now sending cabinet members was a form of national unity, which he found deeply moving. Now, the extraordinary situation has intensified, and due to the breakdown of the economic conference, external relations are subject to increased pressure in British colonies. Therefore, given this situation, it is likely that difficult times will be encountered even before 1936. National unity is something to be supported.</p>
<p>However, party leaders seeking party interests and wanting to pretend at national unity are being rejected by the public because the public is rejecting political parties. If we do not make a decisive move and establish major national policies, it will be difficult to easily agree to the government's policies. He hoped that they would review the platform printed by Kokumin Dōmei. Later, President Adachi added that he wanted to revise the election law and guide thought, but the Ministry of Interior's plan did not meet these hopes. Even the proportional representation system could not prevent improper behavior. Saitō returned to Tokyo after the meeting. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communication Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Prime Minister Saitō met with President Suzuki, key figures in the Seiyūkai, Yamamoto Jōtarō and other committee members, repeatedly discussed concrete methods for cooperating on national policies. Currently, there are three broadly predictable methods: ㈠ President Suzuki joins the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. ㈡ The government establishes a National Policy Deliberation Council, with Suzuki as a member. ㈢ The Seiyūkai sends representatives to negotiate with the government on various policies each time. The Seiyūkai does not favor the first option of a Minister without Portfolio. Regarding the second option of establishing a National Policy Deliberation Council, the government has already started preparing the budget for the next fiscal year, and it is practically impossible to add the Seiyūkai's opinions. The third method allows the Seiyūkai's opinions to be expressed earlier, so the Seiyūkai's opinion roughly settles on this third method of representative negotiation.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida, who is recuperating in Hakone and will not attend tomorrow's regular cabinet meeting, has suddenly been rumored to have submitted his resignation, causing considerable ripples in political circles. However, Prime Minister Saitō has denied this, saying that Foreign Minister Uchida came to him and said that he was going to Hakone to recuperate and could not attend the cabinet meeting, but he absolutely did not submit his resignation. Due to the trembling of his fingers, he would not resign even after returning to Tokyo.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Explains Public Bond Policy <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Japanese government started the September 18th Incident and greatly increased its military activities in China, military spending has increased daily. In the current situation,</p>
<p>it seems there is no way to stop it. The financial community is greatly worried about the pressure of military expenses on public finances in the future. For this year's and next year's budgets, it is planned to issue 2 billion yen in public bonds. For the 1935 budget, due to the desire to compete in armaments with Britain and the United States, there is no way to reduce it. Regarding public bond policy, Finance Minister Takahashi expressed his views as follows: ㈠ Public bonds are divided into three types: one is military public bonds, for which a separate public bond law will be established to regulate their issuance; the second is public bonds for productive enterprises, which will be managed within the scope of the Public Enterprise Promotion Bond Law; and the third is deficit public bonds, which will be used to cover financial shortfalls. Regardless of how they are categorized, the total amount will only increase. ㈡ The policy of fiscal expansion will continue to be adopted, with all public bonds being acquired by the Bank of Japan. ㈢ Interest rates will be gradually reduced, with a repayment period of 20 or 30 years.

<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the Japanese Naval Ministry and the Foreign Ministry's opinions have gradually diverged. The Foreign Ministry is striving to break through isolated diplomacy, while the Naval Ministry continues its military actions. According to sources in local military circles, the Japanese Navy has long coveted our South China region and plans to occupy a key location in South China in advance, before a war with Britain and the United States, as a base for its naval and air forces. It is heard that this conspiracy is already in concrete progress. (28th Dispatch from the China United Press)</p>
<p>Cottonseed Pills</p>
<h3 id="e49">Can Treat Illnesses and Provide Sustenance <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<h3 id="e50">New Invention by German Professor Schmid <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Berlin Correspondence: Using pills for sustenance, originally an ideal, is now becoming a reality. This is the result of five years of intensive research by Professor Schmid of the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Rich nutrients are extracted from cottonseed and administered to patients, with excellent results. The extracted substance is similar to yellow powder and contains vitamins A, B, C, and E; the only missing vitamin is D, which can be added. Cottonseed extract contains 50% protein and 7.5% minerals. Its use on hospital patients has shown that it is truly a new way to nourish humans and may cause a revolution in health maintenance. According to medical reports, administering one spoonful of this substance daily to patients, either directly or added to other foods, for three months not only helps those suffering from malnutrition, but also those suffering from diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, bile disorders, and tuberculosis to</p>
<p>gain weight and experience significant improvements in their mental state. Doctors now believe that cottonseed extract can also prevent cancer, as the medical community increasingly diagnoses cancer as originating from malnutrition. According to records, no patients taking cottonseed extract have experienced any adverse effects. Furthermore, because it is a powder, it is especially convenient for patients who cannot take pills. This substance is also an essential ingredient in skin disease treatments. There are many ways to consume it, and its benefits are immense. Therefore, cotton-producing countries can now add a great new industry of health products. Cottonseed extract can be added to cream, cheese, bread, ice cream, and candy, and to beverages such as wine, coffee, milk, and cocoa, increasing their nutritional value by 20% to 30%. According to chemical tests, fermentation and yeast are greatly enhanced by adding a small amount of cottonseed extract. Professor Schmid, the inventor of this substance, claims that two cottonseed pills a day can replace three meals. In the future, this substance can become the "iron ration" for soldiers, explorers, long-distance pilots, and civilians during food shortages. The state of Baden will soon begin testing cottonseed pills on schoolchildren, with official doctors closely monitoring the results. The Italian government is also paying attention to Schmid's invention and plans to develop cotton fields in its colonies. Schmid completed his experiments in Egypt. Schmid's products are now sold in Egyptian markets. The Chinese and Japanese governments are also inquiring about Schmid's invention and the results of his experiments.</p>

<p>Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, and Harrison, the Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, are scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt tomorrow. They will participate in a roundtable discussion with other international economic experts, primarily focusing on the duel between the British pound and the U.S. dollar. (27th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, after a detailed investigation of the currency opinions of members of Congress, the US President believes that if prices and public purchasing power do not increase, a bill to force monetary inflation will be passed after Congress reconvenes in January next year. Therefore, he intends to earnestly handle this matter in early autumn to prevent Congress from having plans to disrupt industry and commerce. Roughly, after meeting with Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, within this week, he will convene the Brain Trust to create a plan to further increase purchasing power. As for the meeting between the US President and Norman, Wall Street bankers in New York and economic experts in Washington all say that the President is prepared to discuss stabilizing the gold standard, as he believes that the progress of the industrial recovery plan has guaranteed an increase in purchasing power. With increased purchasing power, prices will naturally rise, negating the need for large-scale monetary inflation. It is heard that Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank Harrison, and others have prepared reports on foreign trade, price levels, and the success of the recovery plan for reference during the meeting. According to Wall Street sources, the US President will discuss with Norman the feasibility of establishing a currency stabilization fund. (27th Dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to sources close to the US government, France is currently under pressure from many sides to abandon the gold standard. As a result of this pressure, the US government may be able to open gold in New York and establish a free trading market. In recent weeks, although European gold standard countries have strengthened their gold positions through cooperation between central banks, the pressure on the Netherlands has not eased slightly. The ongoing battle has caused world gold prices to be higher than in the United States. If European countries are unable to maintain this struggle, the United States can establish a free gold trading market without fear of disrupting currency and finance. According to treasury officials, the US Department of Justice's campaign to force gold hoarders to surrender their gold has failed, and the gold coins and gold certificates currently scattered among the people are the fewest in fifty years. According to a Treasury Department investigation, the whereabouts of only 57.4 million US dollars in gold coins and gold certificates are currently unknown. It is estimated that most of them have been destroyed, lost, or smuggled to Europe. Although there are huge amounts of gold that are known to be hoarded privately, the whereabouts of most of the others are unknown. Therefore, the government's gold position is excellent. Regardless of where those scattered abroad go, they are unlikely to have a disruptive effect on finance. As for what actions the government will take against known gold hoarders, nothing has been heard today. (28th Dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e56">France Has No Intention of Abandoning the Gold Standard <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The decline in the value of British and American currencies is now causing unease among French financiers, but most public opinion believes that France will not abandon the gold standard unless forced to. Currently, France's gold reserves reach 79.62%, and the public feels that France is not worried about the currency devaluation of other countries, because most of France's business is in French colonies. France's biggest danger lies in balancing the French budget. It is found that the French budget is short 60 billion francs. There is little hoarding of cash other than by the Bank of France. Although trade is not smooth, it is still satisfactory. The general public is paying close attention to tomorrow's meeting between bankers and Roosevelt. (27th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Britain Doubts Roosevelt's Policies <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(London) Since the United States implemented "the experiment of the New Economic Policy," the major British newspapers have daily criticized President Roosevelt's policies in editorials or special articles. Initially, British public opinion was quite favorable. Londoners believed that the leader of the American Democratic Party had a strong reputation for liberalism abroad and could understand the actual situation in the international arena. Hearing of his election, they were all delighted, admiring his character. Therefore, they also expressed sympathy for his policies. At the beginning of March this year, Roosevelt's plan was to make domestic and foreign affairs mutually coordinated, that is, to engage in rescuing the economy from panic internally, and to advocate cooperation with various countries externally to solve world economic problems. Providing the Allied nations with a favorable solution to the war debt problem was also included. Unexpectedly, after a period of time, the American attitude greatly disappointed people. The biggest problem left by the European war (referring to war debts) has been delayed and not resolved. From the perspective of the debtor nations, it must be resolved as soon as possible, but the United States ultimately considers it a secondary issue and will only consider it after the American domestic economy recovers. The return of American policy to nationalism can be seen here. However, British people only expressed disappointment about this. Until the eve of the opening of the Economic Conference and after it had already opened, the American representatives refused to sign the declaration on stabilizing currencies as many as three times, and the argument was greatly angered. Generally, people believe that if measures are to be taken to rescue the economy from panic, currency should first be stabilized. Even if it cannot be said that rescue cannot be discussed without this, the importance of its relationship is undeniable. However, the United States stubbornly refused to do so, and the agitation of people's hearts can be imagined. The disagreement between the United States and general opinion fortunately relied on the mediation of representatives of various autonomous territories, and emotional relationships began to get closer. Those who defend the United States must say that Britain has not also experienced the devaluation of the pound and monetary inflation? This is true, but the reason for Britain's so is the natural result of the situation, not that</p>
<p>Britain intended to make it so. Britain has used the method of the de facto stable pound, reorganized the economy, and established an adjustment fund to prevent monetary inflation, rescue the pound from falling, and prevent planned changes in various currencies. This is obvious to all. Since the close of the Economic Conference, British people have been gradually observing "the experiment of the American New Economic Policy." No change, no matter how big or small, has been missed. Public opinion towards the United States has changed from sympathy to criticism, and then the concept of interests and harms has risen from criticism. Extending to the present, most people feel that Roosevelt has faced the greatest difficulty of "raising prices," so they cannot help but express doubt about his policies. However, most people still quietly watch the success or failure and use humorous words to comfort themselves, saying, "We should not take two steps forward at the same time. Only after the first step is successful can there be a second step. Now, it is not yet known whether the first step will be successful, so we should not rush to take the second step." The Secretary of the Treasury is currently studying the facts in order to find a way. (27th Dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>President Roosevelt has signed the auto industry code, which stipulates weekly working hours from 35 to 48 hours and minimum hourly wages from 40 to 43 cents. Although auto industry tycoon Ford did not participate in the preparation of this industry code, the industry code is a concession to Ford. The industry code does not mention price limits, and allows manufacturers to hire workers and give them promotions and demotions based on their performance, regardless of which union they belong to. The labor side accepts this clause, with the understanding that it does not prejudice collective bargaining and a reservation against including this clause in any other industry code. Of the 40 million workers in the country, 15 million are now working under industry codes, and 18 industries are self-governing under federal supervision. The National Industrial Recovery Act Execution Office now estimates that 2 million automatic resumption-of-work agreements have been signed. (27th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>According to news from President Roosevelt's villa, Under Secretary of State Professor Moley has resigned today. Moley is President Roosevelt's trusted advisor, and most of the policies he has implemented since taking office are based on Moley's proposals. Currently, he has obvious disagreements with Secretary of State Hull, so he resigned himself. Roosevelt has already approved it, and the dismissal will take effect from September 7.

<p>Under Secretary of State Moley, who has always been the US President's brain trust, resigned today to avoid divisions within the Brain Trust and the Democratic Party. However, Secretary of State Hull said that he did not receive any news in advance, and this move came as a surprise to him. (27th Dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) There is now talk that Professor Moley, a trusted advisor to President Roosevelt, is about to resign. According to news reported today, Professor Moley plans to edit a new national weekly magazine. If the resignation rumor is realized, it will be the first breakdown in President Roosevelt's political family. After the World Economic Conference ended, President Roosevelt and Professor Moley exchanged letters guaranteeing the continuation of their friendship. Professor Moley is nominally the Under Secretary of State in Roosevelt's cabinet,</p>
<p>But in reality, he is an encyclopedia who follows President Roosevelt around. Moley's father was a worker who came from Ireland. Moley has been a friend of Roosevelt</p>
<p>for many years. During the campaign to elect the president, he followed Roosevelt everywhere to promote him. After Roosevelt took office as president, Moley was involved in confidential matters and often sat next to the head of state in the White House in the evening to discuss the current situation. Moley graduated from Baldwin Wallace College twenty-seven years ago, and later pursued a career as a professor of public law and politics. Moley is erudite and capable, pays attention to current affairs, does research for the president, and writes articles summarizing the week's events for newspapers, earning a great reputation. If he leaves the White House now, President Roosevelt will definitely feel like he has lost an arm. (28th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>Reuters 27th Paris Dispatch: Today, more than 50,000 residents of the Saar region went to Niedewod, South Prussia, to express their loyalty to their German motherland. Because in 1935 the Saar region will vote to decide whether the region will continue to be administered by the League of Nations, or whether it will be incorporated into France or Germany, the National Socialist Party is actively promoting it. It is heard that the chairman of the Saar Governing Commission will file a protest with the League of Nations against the National Socialist Party's propaganda. Paris also seems rather uneasy about this matter.</p>
<p>National News Agency 28th Rutesheim Dispatch: 30,000 Germans came by special train from the Saar region, and another 100,000 people came from all over Germany, all gathered in front of the historical monument in Nittelwald, overlooking the Rhine River, to express their loyalty to Germany. Prime Minister Hitler gave a speech to the gathering, saying, "We have repeatedly stated that we do not want to and do not want to incorporate the lands of other countries into Germany. However, our enemies must be made to respect treaties. The people of the Saar will vote in 1935 to decide which country they wish to belong to. I know that everyone will vote to support the motherland. Germany will never abandon the Saar region, and the Saar region will never turn its back on Germany. One day, the Saar region will return to the German motherland, and there will be no greater joy in our lives than this."</p>
<p>National News Agency 27th Rutesheim Dispatch: After participating in the Danlenburg Memorial Ceremony, German Prime Minister Hitler took a large plane to Berlin to meet with about 100 German aviators who had just completed the 1933 Air Race.

<p>Bolivian-Paraguayan Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e64">Four Countries Ask the United States to Arbitrate <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency 27th Asunción Dispatch: Diplomats from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru have drafted a method for resolving the basic issues in the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia, advocating first asking the US Supreme Court for arbitration. If the Supreme Court refuses to arbitrate or cannot mediate, then they will ask the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration. However, according to the Constitution, the US Supreme Court has no right to arbitrate disputes between two foreign countries. Therefore, it is now planned to first inquire in Washington whether any of the judges of the Supreme Court are willing to arbitrate for the two countries. According to the opinions of the four neutral countries' diplomats, there are only two basic issues in the Chaco Valley dispute: ㈠ Bolivia, lacking a sea outlet, wants to obtain a sea route through the Pilcomayo River and the Paraguay River in the Chaco Valley. ㈡ Both countries want to obtain a portion of the Chaco Valley. The purpose of the war is only to gain more land. However, the US Supreme Court's litigation is usually very complicated, and since the United States is one of the neutral committee members and has not been able to find a solution before, it is feared that it may not be able to mediate. Therefore, it is expected that this case will ultimately be submitted to the Hague Court.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In recent years, the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been affected by rayon, plummeting drastically. The Executive Yuan has repeatedly received requests from various parties to continue issuing the remaining two million of the public bonds for the relief of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, together with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, were ordered to properly plan for fundamental improvement and relief measures. So far, the public bonds have not been issued. According to Dong Xiujia, the silkworms raised by farmers this year have had a very good harvest, especially the improved silkworm cocoons, which are of good quality and white in color, selling for forty to fifty yuan per dan. As for the two million public bonds, the Ministry of Finance has not approved their issuance due to fund issues, but they are not needed at the moment. As for fundamental relief, it will start with improving silkworm seed and sericulture. Now that the results of improved seeds are good, efforts should be made to promote them so that people can adopt improved seeds. Mulberry trees are also being purchased and distributed to farmers for planting. Although the decline of the silk industry in recent years has been affected by the dumping of foreign goods, the poor quality of the silk itself is also the biggest reason. This fundamental improvement plan is currently being carried out by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sericulture Control Association. (Special Dispatch from the 28th)</p>

<p>丨Protecting Exploitation with Troops丨</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: It has been almost two years since Japan seized Manchuria. During these two years, coupled with the Rehe War, we, travelers in a foreign land, not only have witnessed the tyranny of Japanese imperialism, implementing its "way of destruction," but also have personally tasted the flavor of the "way of destruction."</p>
<p>Everyone who has been to the Northeast has seen the methods by which the Japanese invaded the Northeast and knows the means they use. Since the so-called Manchurian state was established, the situation has changed even more. In the past, China still retained an empty name, at least we Chinese could walk and speak more conveniently. Now, it's different. The superficial order (limited to cities along the railway lines) seems to be better, but the so-called bandits of the Japanese, which from the perspective of the Chinese nation are volunteer armies, are still emerging unpredictably, especially in various parts of northern Manchuria, and along the Jihui Line, they are extremely fierce. The Kwantung Army Headquarters once boasted that order had been restored and that they could live a peaceful life from now on. In fact, the so-called restoration and the so-called peace are only in a few large cities on the South Manchuria Railway or Dalian, and other places are not included. As for places thirty or forty miles away from the railway, there is no peace. When the Japanese army first arrived in the Northeast, it tried its best to seize power, so the main force was concentrated in a few large cities and forcibly seized several mines, seizing the industries operated by Chinese capital, which made the social economy of the three northeastern provinces even more decline. At the same time, this method cannot solve the economic panic in Japan. So it changed its policy, from the city to the countryside, and implemented its armed immigration policy. Everyone knows that the place where it immigrates is Jiamusi on the Songhua River, because this is the most fertile and suitable place for rainfall in the northern Manchurian region, and there are many virgin lands to be reclaimed. Chinese people have also put a lot of effort there and have opened up many places, so the Japanese specifically proposed it as their immigration test area. Last October, the first batch of 500 immigrants arrived in Jiamusi. They all carried rifles and were equipped with an appropriate number of bullets, but without family members. Judging from the current situation, I am afraid that they will not be able to bring their family members in the end. The reasons are: First, daily life there is unstable, and volunteer armies often come in and out. This kind of army specializes in making things difficult for the Japanese, which makes them unable to settle down and cultivate the land. Second, the weather is too cold. In winter, it can be as cold as minus forty degrees. They have to live in the house for almost half a year. The Japanese are already not used to this kind of life, and Japanese women don't even need to be mentioned. Third, diet is also very inconvenient. People who are used to eating rice, how can they eat sorghum? Even if they eat white noodles every day, it is still a hard thing. Since life has such troubles, and their purpose in going there is for life, so in less than half a year, 50 out of 500 people openly lagged behind, and more than 110 people fled back to Japan. Only 300 people remained. The second batch of armed immigrants could not recruit enough 500 people in Japan, and as a result, only 450 people arrived in Jiamusi in July of this year. This group of immigrants is generally not as good as last year's in terms of spirit. However, their organization is more meticulous, and the use of weapons is more flexible. In addition to reclaiming land, they also use the cover of political power to seize the land of Chinese farmers for their (immigrants') farming needs. Some repay a few tenths of the land price, giving a price of one to three yuan per hectare. Some even use military force to forcibly take it, regardless of whether you sell it or not, and just take it directly. The oppressed and honest Chinese farmers, what else can they say, and where dare they say anything?</p>
<p>They occupy the land of the Chinese and use it as their own land for Japanese self-cultivating farmers. At present, Japanese immigrants are building shrines, building hospitals, and reforming the agricultural tools used by the Chinese. The immigration policy that has been advocated for many years has taken more than a year. In addition to the farmers themselves having guns, a considerable amount of troops must be stationed in the surrounding counties and towns to protect them. More than 20,000 troops are stationed along the Middle East Road. In fact, they only protect 700 immigrants. From this, we cannot but say that their immigration policy is not a failure, but they still have places to seek compensation. The first is the income from the South Manchuria Railway and the industries along the South Manchuria Railway, as well as the railways built by Chinese capital seized after the September 18 Incident, such as the Taoang Road, the Feng Hai Road, and the Da Tong Road, etc., have all become the property of the South Manchuria Railway. The second is that industries operated by Chinese people, such as mines and factories, are often confiscated under the pretext of anti-Manchurian crimes.</p>
<p>Although Japanese immigration has failed, in addition to seeking compensation economically, they also have their movement of officials politically. The hotels in Shenyang and Changchun (opened by the Japanese) are full of people every day, all coming to find official positions. Now, in every county office, in addition to a puppet who is a fake countryman, there is another Japanese who acts as a councilor. In fact, the Japanese councilor (some say he is an instructor) has full authority, but he cannot arrange for a large number of officials from Japan to be placed (the total number of Japanese officials already employed in the four northeastern provinces is more than 1,500), and there are more than 2,000 living in hotels. Therefore, the puppet state's General Affairs Office is planning to divide each county into four or five districts, and each district will be assigned a councilor or instructor, all of whom are Japanese with dual nationality, to supervise the puppet county magistrate and rule the people. The exploitation and corruption of these people is more shameless and fierce than the old bureaucrats who used to care about face. Therefore, the slaves who used to express goodwill to Japan are now gradually feeling some remorse, but unfortunately, there is a lack of opportunity to serve the motherland. (August 22)</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Expert Wu Tongju's Letter to Li Xie</p>
<h3 id="e92">Statement of Opinions on Governing the Yellow River <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>In addition to embankment projects, industrial revitalization should also be implemented.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Yellow River's breach and flood disaster is expanding. Although the summer flood season has passed, the autumn flood season is approaching rapidly. If the embankment projects at various breach points are not expedited, the consequences will be dire. In light of this, water conservancy expert Wu Tongju recently sent a letter to Li Xie (Yizhi), Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, outlining fundamental plans for comprehensively repairing all embankments, increasing the construction of stone dams, and other measures. He further advocated that, in addition to construction projects, industrial revitalization should also be implemented. If revitalization can be integrated into the projects, costs can be reduced and benefits expanded. The letter, consisting of over a thousand words, is recorded below: "To Mr. Yizhi, I was deeply concerned upon hearing of your illness in Xi'an this spring and summer. Later, upon meeting Brother Xu Jiachen, I was relieved to learn that you have largely recovered, but remain weak and require recuperation. This year, the Yangtze River experienced high floods, but was protected due to the completion of embankment works. Unexpectedly, the Yellow River has overflowed, causing multiple breaches in Lankao, Changdong, and several other counties, resulting in an expanding disaster. I was shocked to hear the news. Fortunately, the main channel has not been diverted, but the flooding has already submerged hundreds of miles of land on both the north and south banks. The autumn flood season is long, and the consequences of unblocked breaches are unimaginable. Yesterday, I received a provincial order to investigate the Lankao breaches, but the trip was canceled due to the easing situation. Instead, I went to your commission and the Huai River Commission to inquire about everything. I met Vice Chairman Wang, who indicated that a plan was already in place, mentioning that the Yellow River is too wide in some areas and needs to be narrowed with long embankments, straightened bends, and that the estuary needs to be dredged. These are indeed fundamental plans. Recently, I also read the telegrams from Vice Chairman Wang and Brother Jiachen, which clearly distinguished between priorities. Today's newspapers reported your telegram to the Executive Yuan, which demonstrates your balanced and objective perspective on the overall situation. This matter is only about prioritizing tasks, not about right or wrong. We share the same concerns. Now that you have arrived in Nanjing for meetings, concrete solutions should be reached soon. There is no need for lengthy discussions. In my opinion, there are many post-disaster issues that need to be addressed, and the most important and urgent is the issue of closing the breaches. This major embankment project requires your leadership. Given your position, no one else is suitable. For the embankment project, the old method of 'soft embankment' can be adopted, which is easier to implement. In the past, the Gongjia breach in Shandong Province adopted a new method of piling and stonework, which was ultimately risky. I believe you are aware of this. For today's situation, advance preparation is crucial: First, 'Recruit talent.' Shandong and Henan provinces have more experienced Yellow River workers than Hebei. Appointing the right person to manage the breach closure is critical. If the right person is found, the task will be half completed with twice the result. Second, 'Prepare materials.' In the past, embankment closures in the East River often used *ji*. With the current flooding on both banks, the *ji* may be rotten and unusable. It may be necessary to purchase and transport materials from afar. Other materials such as [missing text] are also required in large quantities and must be fully stocked to avoid delays. The above is very important. With sufficient preparation, work can begin immediately. Before starting work, it is necessary to assess the direction of the main channel near the breaches, select a location for the [missing text] and determine the platform in preparation for occupying it. It may be necessary to first [missing text] water to [missing text] to prevent the closure from becoming more difficult. After the closure, [missing text] embankment, replenish the main embankment, build ring embankments, and add support embankments, or fill in the breaches and build dam piles, all of which have established precedents. Special attention should be paid to guarding against ice floods and peach blossom floods in dangerous and remote areas, and sufficient materials should be prepared. If the breach closes naturally, as in the case of the Liu Zhuang breach in Dongming in 1926, it will be easier to build a main embankment. Currently, floodwaters are still rising from time to time, and there are many dangerous works in Henan and Shandong provinces. These can be entrusted to the river affairs bureaus of the two provinces to take charge separately. You can focus on closing the breaches, which will be easier and more effective. However, the great task of governing the Yellow River is not limited to closing breaches. It is also necessary to plan for fundamental solutions: First, comprehensively repair all embankments. Jia Rang's three policies referred to Yu the Great and set high goals. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, they have not been applicable. The achievements of Pan Jixun and Jin Fu in the Ming and Qing dynasties were based on the lowest of Jia Rang's three policies: repairing the old embankments, increasing the height and thickness of weak and damaged sections. The entire system is diseased, and unless a comprehensive repair is undertaken now, repeated flooding will continue year after year, resulting in endless labor and expense. In past dynasties, there were examples of increasing the height of the embankments by five inches each year and undertaking a major repair every few years. Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty years have passed without annual repairs, and major repairs cannot be further delayed. Second, increase the construction of stone dams. East of Mengjin, the soil is loose and the water flows freely. The main river embankments have repeatedly failed. In the Guangxu period of the Qing dynasty, Henan Province began to use stone paving to protect the embankment slopes, which was very effective. The crushed stone dams were particularly effective. In recent years, Shandong Province has followed suit, but it is difficult to transport stone in the Puyang and Fanxian areas due to their distance from the mountains. Changyuan and Dongming have not yet implemented this measure. The junction of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces is extremely dangerous and requires more crushed stone dams to deflect the floodwaters and provide protection. This can be compared to the T-head groynes invented by German engineer Engels. American engineer Freeman also advocated guiding the water flow in the central channel, which is the same idea. This year's Yellow River disaster provides a major lesson: embankments without dams are the same as having no embankments. With the completion of the dam works, the main embankment will be permanently secure. Third, dredge the estuary. This issue is the most difficult to address. The Southern River Party has repeatedly discussed the estuary. The water flows freely upon reaching the estuary, and human efforts are difficult to implement. Neither the "Water Dragon" nor the "Iron Rib" have been very effective. The only method is to continue building long embankments to confine the water and attack the sand. I have often examined the Yellow River situation in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. In Henan and Hebei provinces, the river channel is wide, with the distance between the two embankments ranging from ten to forty miles. To the north, there is the Taihang embankment and the ancient Great Jin embankment as a major barrier, which is strategically advantageous, but still cannot prevent flooding due to the disrepair of the embankments. On the south bank, there is only the official embankment and no [missing text] embankment, so there are many dangerous works on the south bank. Further downstream in Shandong Province, from Puyang, Li Sheng Tun to Shouzhang and Dongping, the Jin embankment serves as the official embankment on the north, and there is also a large official embankment on the south, with a distance of up to fifty or sixty miles between the two embankments. However, near the river, there are people's embankments only two or three miles wide, which seems to be too tight. From Dong'e to Licheng, there is a mountain range to the south as a barrier, and there are also people's embankments within the official embankment to the north, making the river channel narrow and constricted. From Licheng to Lijin, the official embankment is guarded to the south, and the people's embankment is guarded to the north. North of the people's embankment, there was an official embankment, but it has been abandoned for a long time, and the river channel is still narrow. Below Lijin, there are only people's embankments, ending at Tie Menguan. In general, the problem lies in the people's embankments. If the people's embankments are to be abolished, it will be difficult to relocate the people, and it is not permitted by the facts. The river flows in the people's embankments, constrained on the left and right. If the lower reaches are blocked, the upper reaches will overflow, which is inevitable. When the tail escapes the embankments, the water flows freely and naturally. If the flow is weak, it will be even less smooth downstream. As a result, the water within the embankments of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces is confined, and river disasters occur. Currently, there are more than ten channels in the Tie Menguan area, which change every year and have a poor shape. Allowing them to develop naturally will lead to siltation and a rising estuary. Without an outlet, the water will inevitably divert north to seize the Zhang and Wei rivers and south to seize the Si and Huai rivers. There are historical precedents for this, which is alarming. So, what can be done? The only solution is to build embankments to confine the water, as suggested by Vice Chairman Wang. However, there are concerns that the soil is not firm and the embankments will easily collapse, ultimately making it impossible to contain the water, so the effect is uncertain. The above three matters cannot be accomplished without large sums of money. Whether the Yellow River Commission can overcome these difficulties, I believe you have already planned. There is one more thing, that is, in addition to construction projects, revitalization must also be implemented, which is also important. Raising large sums of money to relieve the people's hunger and suffering is not your official responsibility, but the facts are intertwined, so you cannot ignore it. Even in terms of construction, raising funds for construction is likely to be very difficult, which is foreseeable. In my humble opinion, if revitalization can be integrated into the construction projects, costs can be reduced and benefits expanded. A Yellow River Construction and Revitalization Committee could be organized by the central government to take charge of the matter, with the Premier of the Executive Yuan as chairman and the Minister of Finance as vice-chairman, which would have greater strength and smoother progress. This is a once-in-a-century undertaking. I hope you will consider it carefully. However, if the Yellow River Commission can be established on a regular basis and authorized by the central government, there is no need to start anew. Benefiting the country and the people is within sight. I wrote this hastily late at night and hope you will consider it."</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Desolate Scene of Baotou <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sun Dianying's Troops Prepare to Move West</p>
<p>Heavy Taxes and a Pessimistic Outlook for Business</p>
<p>Baotou Correspondence: Sun Dianying's troops have been ordered to enter Qinghai for land reclamation and are departing from Chahar, concentrating in the Baotou and Sayan areas to prepare for their journey to Qinghai. This unit is the 9th Army Corps of North China, consisting of three armies. In addition to the original 41st Army, there is the 55th Army and the newly formed Cavalry Army. Sun Dianying himself concurrently serves as the commander of the 41st Army. The 55th Army is formed by transferring a part of the original 55th Army and the 5th Regiment of the 41st Army stationed in Jincheng. The Cavalry Army is formed by the two cavalry divisions from the old Rehe, with Yu Shiming as the commander. Sun Dianying is currently in Taiyuan and will inspect the troops stationed in Jincheng within days. According to Yu Shiming, "Our army fought against the Japanese in Rehe, which is the duty of soldiers. We worked hard for the country, and the soldiers were determined to die to resist and kill the enemy. However, we were an isolated army outside the Great Wall, and our rear was cut off, so we could not fight for long. When we retreated from Chifeng to Cone Mountain, we held our ground and planned to connect with friendly forces to attack Chengde's rear, but we were separated by thousands of miles and could not coordinate. Now that the war has ended, our army has witnessed the difficulties of the country. We will never participate in civil wars again and will concentrate on training to serve the country in the future. We are now ordered to move west, but the roads are rugged, and the population is sparse. Without sufficient preparation, long-distance marching will be difficult. The uniforms, shoes, socks, and all supplies that we have made could not be delivered earlier due to the situation in Chahar, but they will be delivered within days. Currently, in addition to strict training, our army is also repairing roads and preparing to drill wells in waterless areas along the way to be prepared when we depart in the future. However, it is now autumn, and the weather is getting colder. If we delay another month, we will not be able to depart. If we cannot depart this year, our original intention will not change. As long as there is an order, we will still move west at any time."</p>
<p>In addition to Sun's troops, there is also Wang Jingguo's 70th Division stationed in Baotou. Most of the troops are stationed outside the city, and there are few troops stationed inside the city. The military and civilians live in harmony, and the area is peaceful.</p>
<p>Baotou is the terminal of the Ping Sui Railway and the gathering place for goods from the Northwest. It was quite prosperous in 1926 and 1927, with a population of about 180,000. Goods from the Northwest were loaded and unloaded here for transport to the East. In recent years, it has declined, and the population has decreased to less than 100,000. Trade and transportation have also stagnated. The main reasons are the heavy taxes and the inconvenient transportation. There are as many as sixteen or seventeen tax collection agencies in Baotou. Goods are heavily taxed upon arrival, making them impossible to sell, which discourages merchants. Opium from Gansu and Qinghai is exported in large quantities every year and used to be transshipped through Baotou. In recent years, it is transported directly from Shaanxi to the East without the need for travel. As for the local products of fur and wool, they are all stagnant, and prices have fallen. No one is collecting or transporting them. If this continues, the future will be very dangerous.</p>
<p>The city walls of Baotou are made of earth, and most of the houses are also earthen houses. The streets and alleys are all dirt roads, with sand up to the shins. On sunny days, red dust fills the air. When the wind blows, sand and rocks fly. After heavy rain, it becomes muddy and difficult to travel. In addition, sanitation is neglected, and flies and mosquitoes abound. It is a typical Northwestern city, and there is still a long way to go in terms of improvement. (August 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Completion of Four Major Provincial Highways in Jiangxi <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yu Ping Railway Surveying is About to be Completed</p>
<p>Headquarters Orders Bandit Suppression Troops to Rush to Build Highways</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In Jiangxi Province, where bandits are everywhere and specialize in disrupting transportation, the authorities are still actively implementing road construction projects. According to recent investigations, the four major provincial highways have been completed in succession. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Jiangxi-Hunan Highway <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The entire route can be completed within this month. Starting from the 20th, it can be reached from the provincial capital directly to Pingxiang by car in eight hours. It can also be connected from Pingxiang to the Zhuping Road and then to the Yuehan Road. A new era of transportation has been opened in the rugged mountains of western Jiangxi.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Jiangxi-Zhejiang Highway <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>This route was originally scheduled to be completed last year. However, the section of Yanshan, Yiyang, and Guixi was severely damaged by Fang Zhimin's bandit group. It was destroyed and rebuilt, and rebuilt and destroyed again. As a result, it is now fully completed. Tickets will be sold for the direct Nanchang to Yushan route starting from the first of next month. The opening ceremony will be held in Hekou on that day. There is currently a motor road from Yushan to Changshan. In the future, it will be connected to the Hangjiang Road, so Nanchang can use this route to reach the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Jiangxi-Fujian Highway <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>This route has long been open to Nancheng, and a branch line is also open to Nanfeng. However, the section from Nancheng to Lichuan, which directly reaches the Fujian border, is still missing. Now that Lichuan has been recovered, the highway office is preparing to advance with the army to complete this section to reach Guangze in Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Jiangxi-Guangdong Line <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The northern section of this line has long been open to Majiazhou in Taihe. The southern section, built by the Guangdong army, can reach Dayu from Nanxiong. There are still several sections in Taihe, Ganxian, and Nankang, which have been severely affected by bandits. No one can be assigned to work. Now Chairman Chiang has negotiated with the National Economic Council to allocate 100,000 yuan to the Southern Route Headquarters and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to carry out the project in sections to open up the Jiangxi-Guangdong transportation to facilitate the bandit suppression military in Ganjiang. It is expected that the completion date will not be far away.</p>
<p>The Yuping Railway is the only important east-west route in the Southeast, and it is extremely important for both defense and economy. The surveying team sent by the railway is currently rushing to survey and can be completed as scheduled. The provincial government believes that the engineering costs borne by the province are in urgent need of funds (the cost of railway track materials is borne by the central government), and has decided to use the salt surcharge as a fund to issue public bonds of 12 million yuan to complete the project as soon as possible. After this road is completed, it can be connected to the Yuehan, Hangjiang and other routes, and the products of the southeastern provinces can be shipped out of the Zhapu estuary.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang believes that transportation is the only key to clearing bandits, so he has repeatedly ordered the provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei to quickly complete the roads in the bandit areas, and stipulated that each division of the garrison must build 50 kilometers of roads in the defense zone every month, except during combat. The headquarters will subsidize 100 yuan per kilometer, and 200 yuan for those who pave stones. At present, the border roads of Jiangxi-Hubei, Jiangxi-Hunan, and Jiangxi-Guangdong are all presided over by the garrison troops, and the construction is being stepped up. Remote areas will soon see connectivity in all directions. (August 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Anqing Bulk Salt Transportation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Datong Chamber of Commerce Asks to Preserve the Salt Wharf</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Datong Town, which belongs to Tongling County in Anhui Province, was only a small barren island before the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. During the Hongyang Rebellion, people from various prefectures of Huizhou and Ningguo came here to seek refuge, and houses were built one after another, forming a settlement. In the second year of the Tongzhi reign, the General Bureau for the Supervision and Sale of Huai Salt was established in this area (renamed the Anhui Wharf Revenue Transport Bureau in the Republic of China) to recruit merchants to transport Huainan salt, build warehouses for storage, and sell it in the eleven counties of Tongling, Qingyang, Guichi, Shitai, Zhizhi, Huaining, Qianshan, Taihu, Wangjiang, and Susong. Those who went to Datong to purchase salt from various counties also loaded local products for barter, so that the area and the opposite bank of Heyuezhou (now both banks are collectively referred to as Datong) have become an important commercial port in southern Anhui over the decades, almost competing with the provincial city of Wuhu. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, according to the telegram from the Huaibei Branch of the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office, stated that, in order to promote the rotation of the Anqing shipping, the wharf (referring to Datong, i.e., the Anhui wharf) has not transported or sold a grain of Huai salt in recent years, which is almost equivalent to an abandoned wharf. In order to open up the abandoned wharf and promote Huai salt, it is necessary to first transport cheap and high-quality salt from Huaibei in order to compete for sales. Moreover, the introduction of the southern Anhui salt is controlled by a small number of people, and the rent price is surprisingly high, making it impossible for other merchants to transport salt. There is a tendency to abandon the wharf rather than allow other merchants to transport salt. It is now proposed to carry out a pilot rotation of salt (Datong has always relied on sailing vessels) with 100 tickets, i.e., 96,000 dan, with the introduction of the northern and southern Anhui salt, and the salt pounds will be allocated to Jinan and Huaibei, each transporting half, and first transport the high-quality salt from Huaibei to open its way. Once it has been successfully operated and the situation of the arrival and competitive sale of the two salts of Jinan and Huaibei has been examined, the permanent quota will be determined. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request and has ordered the two Huai transport envoys, the Huainan transport deputy, and the Anhui Wharf Revenue Transport Bureau to inform them. However, the Datong Chamber of Commerce and other organizations believe that the commercial port has always relied on salt transport as its main source of income. If this case is realized, the market will plummet, which will have a huge impact. Therefore, a joint association of all sectors was organized to preserve the Huainan wharf and to relieve the market and people's livelihood. A meeting was held to express opposition, and four representatives, Fang Duancheng, Sun Faxu, Hu Chaorong, and Li Ziyuan, were sent to the province yesterday to petition various parties. They have already submitted a petition to the provincial government, explaining various reasons and requesting that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order. The representatives also plan to go to Beijing within days to appeal to the Ministry of Finance again to achieve the goal of cancellation. (August 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e101">Strict Prohibition of Setting off Firecrackers in the Urban Area <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Yunqing, Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion of the Third Security Regiment, stated that the setting off of firecrackers in the urban area day and night often caused confusion with the sound of guns and cannons, causing misunderstandings from time to time. If a bandit alarm occurred, it would lead to failure. He was preparing to take measures to reduce it when he received instructions from the Provincial Government through the Security Office to strictly prohibit the setting off of firecrackers. He then sent a letter to the county to forward it to the Public Security Bureau and the First District Office to implement it. A notice was posted, but the custom in Songjiang was deeply rooted and difficult to eradicate at once. On the 28th, during a meeting of township chiefs convened by the First District Office, Commissioner Jin and Battalion Commander Jiang personally gave instructions, explaining that the township chiefs must instruct the village police and neighborhood chiefs to inform each household that the setting off of firecrackers is strictly prohibited day and night. If it occurs, the village police and neighborhood chiefs must investigate and hand them over. Otherwise, if it is found that they have not reported it, the village police and neighborhood chiefs will be held jointly responsible. Starting tomorrow, gongs will be used to warn each section, and strict inspections will be carried out starting from September 3rd.</p>

<p>More than 30 party members in this county, including Jia Yuqiang, had been studying or working in Shanghai and returned to their hometowns during the summer vacation this year, intending to transfer their party membership back. However, the members of the county party committee, fearing that the re-election would fail, refused to transfer them. Jia and others were angry at the committee's control of party affairs and filed a complaint with the provincial party headquarters. It is now heard that the province has appointed Li Junliang to Gaoyou to thoroughly investigate.</p>

<p>Tao Dongyan, a notorious bandit in Tongzhou and Rugao counties, was captured in Pingchao. During the interrogation at the county government, he confessed to robbery, arson, and murder without hesitation. The victims also appeared in court to testify.

<p>Yesterday, the Provincial Public Security Bureau's Detective Team received a report from Detective Wang Juru that a bandit gang led by Zhang Huoyuan was entrenched in Shantian, Baigang Village in the southern suburbs, and was hiding hostages. Captain Shao, acting on the report, ordered Detectives Li Xingwu, Zhang Xiuzhi, and Ma Buyun to lead a dozen detectives in disguise at 10 p.m. that night. They arrived at the bandit den in the dead of night. The village dogs barked wildly. The bandits, hearing the alarm, came out to investigate and realized that they were being apprehended by detectives. More than 30 bandits fired box cannons and fought with Detective Li and others. Detectives Li, Zhang, and Ma and other detectives bravely charged forward. After two hours of fighting, the bandits were overwhelmed and retreated. As a result, four bandits, including Ye Xiufu (aka Dagouzi), Zhu Dazuo, Xia Zhaolu, and Xia Fucai, were captured. Two box cannons, 30 bullets, and two hostages, Zang Xufu, a seven-year-old child from Danyang, and Chen Gensan, were seized. During the firefight, cannonballs were dense like beads. Detective Wang Juru, who bravely fought at the forefront, was shot and killed on the spot. The detectives carried his body back and temporarily placed it in the Taiping Temple on Xinma Road. Detective Li and others led the captured four bandits and hostages back to report. The suspects are currently under investigation.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th, a cargo ship coming from Shangjiang capsized at Dongjiangzui in Xiaoshan due to the impact of the tide. All the paper goods and sundries sank to the bottom of the river. Five of the twelve passengers and boatmen drowned. Most tragically, a ten-year-old child was trapped in the cabin and drowned because the bottom of the boat was facing up and could not be rescued in time.</p>

<p>Qu Zonghai, a resident of the western suburbs of Xiaoshan, had been working as a partner in a sock factory in Shanghai. He returned home last month due to illness. His wife, Yu, had been having an affair. Her husband returned home sick, and the family was in financial straits. On the 25th, she secretly fled. Qu, bedridden, received this news and hanged himself at midnight. Unexpectedly, his 70-year-old mother was also at home. Because her daughter-in-law had fled and her son had died, she had no means of living and drowned in the Qiantang River on the 27th. Of the five members of the family, only two daughters remain. How tragic!</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Police Forces to Provide Tight Security</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered to go to Washington to attend President Roosevelt's World Economic Conference, and to London to attend the World Economic Conference. He also traveled to the United States, Germany, France, and Italy. He returned to China on the 13th aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Jefferson from Seattle. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 10 a.m. Various sectors have made preparations for a warm welcome. After arriving in Shanghai, Song will go to Nanjing and Lushan to report on the trip. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tight Security Expected to Arrive at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>According to news from the Dollar Steamship Company yesterday, the President Jefferson set sail from Kobe the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive at Wusongkou at 5:30 a.m. today. However, the weather was rainy yesterday and the wind and waves along the way were strong, so the ship's speed was slower and is expected to arrive at the Bailianjing Dollar Wharf in Pudong at 10 a.m. today. The municipal government expects a large number of people to welcome him, including key figures from the party and the country. Yesterday, it specially ordered Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, and Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and notified the public security authorities in the concession to provide tight security. It is reported that the Security Bureau and the Public Security Bureau will send a large security team, a large police team, and a large water patrol team to patrol and guard the area around the Sixteen Pups and the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. Detective Captain Lu Ying will also send armed detectives to provide close protection on the spot. It is also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Concession Police Department will also send a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to protect the area around the Customs Wharf and the junction of the French Concession. The municipal government has cleared a space behind the Dada Company in Nanshi as a parking area for guests and has decided to temporarily close the traffic from Xiaodongmen Road to Guanqiao from 6:30 a.m. today until Song lands and passes by. A sign has been posted at the entrance of Dada Wharf No. 5, Xiaodongmen, stating "Welcome Minister Song, a pass is required to enter" to limit access. Three ceremonial arches have been erected at Dada Wharf to show respect.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Declaration of Shanghai Organizations Welcoming Song <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Organizations Welcome Minister Song's Return Preparatory Committee issued a declaration yesterday stating: "This time, Minister Song was ordered to attend the World Economic Conference, upholding the spirit of peace and struggle, seeking cooperation in the world economy, and during his spare time, travelled to famous cities in Europe and America, visited leaders in political circles, sincerely demonstrating the determination of the Chinese nation to uphold justice, exposing the policy of aggressive countries to make distant alliances and attack nearby ones, promoting our national glory, suppressing their fierce flames, fulfilling his mission without disgrace, and returning with honor, his achievements are so great that even Garibaldi could not surpass them. However, technical cooperation has opened up the possibility of cooperation between Europe, America and our country, while the stubborn and strong bandits have already shown signs of drawing swords and stretching bows. The cotton and wheat loan has just opened the way for foreign capital to rebuild China, and the issue of distribution is already causing an uproar throughout the country. Moreover, Minister Song's strategy of firmly defending and clearing the fields to await the strong bandits is still progressing, while rumors of changing diplomatic steps are rampant. Therefore, persisting to the end still requires a statesman with an iron fist, and the determination to revive the country should also be placed on Minister Song and the central supreme leaders for further efforts in the future. We admire Minister Song for not disgracing his mission, and also earnestly hope that Minister Song and the central supreme leaders will overcome all difficulties, vigorously revive our country which is on the verge of extinction, and gradually embark on the broad road of revival. We respectfully offer our sincere hope that you will come as we look forward to the year, to reward the envoy who has travelled tens of thousands of miles. We hope that the unification and revival of China will advance without retreat and be successfully achieved. We swear that we will stand in the position of leaders of the people, leading the vast masses as the backing for statesmen with an iron fist. We hereby declare this, and ask for your observation."</p>

<p>After Minister Song arrives in Shanghai, he will immediately go to Nanjing to report to the central government on the process of this trip, and go to Lushan to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. President Wang Jingwei originally intended to come to Shanghai in person to welcome him, but due to busy political affairs in Nanjing, he was unable to spare time. He specially dispatched Zeng Zhongming last night to come to Shanghai as a representative to welcome him, and brought a handwritten letter from President Wang to personally give to Finance Minister Song. The letter first expressed condolences, then stated the reason for not being able to come to Shanghai, and finally expressed the hope to meet Mr. Song as soon as possible. The central government plans to convene an important meeting after Finance Minister Song returns to the country to discuss future foreign policy and domestic measures. However, the location of the meeting, whether in Nanjing or Lushan, has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Weary from Travel, Outstanding Service <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>

<p>Prince Carl of Sweden, in the middle of last month, set off from his country with a group of four friends for a trip to the Far East. After arriving in Japan, having learned that the weather in Shanghai was exceptionally hot, he stayed in Japan, traveling to various places in Tokyo and Kobe. He embarked on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada last Sunday (27th) to come to China. The ship is scheduled to enter the port at 5 PM today and dock at the Qichang Pier in Pudong at 7 PM.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs learned of Prince Carl of Sweden's visit to China earlier this month, it immediately informed the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Foreign Affairs Office to prepare a welcome. It is now learned that the Municipal Government and the Foreign Affairs Office, due to repeated requests from Lin Gui, the Swedish Chargé d'affaires in China, that Mr. Carl's visit to China is purely for private travel and does not require a welcome, have decided to suspend the welcome. In the future, Mayor Wu may host a private banquet to strengthen Sino-Swedish relations.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Brief Biography of the Prince <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Swedish Consulate stated that Prince Carl of Sweden's visit to China is purely for private travel and has no other mission. It is understood that after Mr. Carl arrives in Shanghai, he will stay for a short time and then go to Nanjing to visit Chairman Lin of the National Government and various central figures, before traveling to Hangzhou and other places. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has recorded his brief biography as follows: Mr. Carl was born in Stockholm on January 10, 1911. He is the nephew of the current Swedish King and is currently 23 years old. He also has two older sisters, one married to a Belgian prince and one married to a Norwegian prince. - Ma Lai</p>
<h3 id="e119">Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Declared the Purpose of the Anti-War Conference</p>
<p>Sir Malet, the British representative and chairman of the Far East Conference of the World Anti-War Alliance, after being refused entry by Japan and returning to Shanghai, visited Mr. Peel, the Director-General, and Mr. Fessenden, the Director, of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Yesterday (August 28th) at 12 noon, he went to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu, who received him. It is reported that Sir Malet, in addition to the visit, also inquired about the Municipal Government's attitude towards the Anti-War Conference. Mayor Wu said that China has always valued peace, and no one opposes the purpose of anti-war. However, he has recently received reports from various parties that the Communist Party in Shanghai is attempting to use the opportunity of the Anti-War Conference to carry out its own activities. We cannot currently determine whether the Third International has actual control over the Anti-War Conference. Furthermore, Shanghai suffered significant losses after the war and urgently needs to restore its pre-war state. It cannot withstand further social unrest. Therefore, the Municipal Government's sole responsibility is to maintain local security and protect the peaceful life and order of the people. Sir Malet also deeply agreed, and at the same time stated that the Anti-War Conference is not controlled by the Third International. If the Communist Party takes the opportunity to carry out activities, the conference can be immediately closed to clarify its attitude. After the discussion, he left. It is reported that Sir Malet still hopes to choose a suitable location in the Public Concession or the French Concession to hold the conference. However, because the American representative has not yet arrived in Shanghai, it is still pending.</p>
<p>Chen Wenlin and Sun Tonggang are About to</p>
<h3 id="e120">Implement a Round-the-Country Flight <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Will Fly to Shandong as Soon as the Jiang Que Plane is Repaired</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang, a young Chinese aviator who studied in Germany, flew back to China in his own plane from a long distance. He went straight from Nanjing back to Jinan. He recently launched a joint round-the-country flight with Feng Yong, the president of Feng Yong University, and invited Chen Wenlin, the director of the Xiamen Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, who is currently in Shanghai, to participate. Yesterday, it was learned that Mr. Sun had repeatedly telegraphed at the beginning of the month, because various circles in Shanghai, such as Mayor Wu Tiecheng and the Aviation Association, were eagerly hoping and repeatedly inviting him to come to Shanghai. Therefore, he replied that he would come to Shanghai at the end of this month or the beginning of September.</p>
<p>However, due to the severe flood disaster in the Yellow River basin in Shandong in recent days, Mr. Sun is giving priority to inspecting the disaster area by plane because of his deep concern for his hometown. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether he can come to Shanghai in the near future. Chen Wenlin's Jiang Que plane, which is being converted with a new engine, is about to be completed. Therefore, Chen is waiting for Mr. Sun to come to Shanghai so that they can set off together for a round-the-country flight. It is reported that if Mr. Sun cannot come to Shanghai, Chen will fly the Jiang Que plane directly to Jinan to join Sun and Feng, and then start the round-the-country flight from Jinan.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Implementation is No Longer a Problem <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Directorate General of Posts dispatched personnel to Fujian and Guangdong to explain the increase in postage to Southeast Asia. It is now learned that the personnel met with various members of the Provincial Government and the Director of the Construction Department in Guangzhou and reported that they had been understood. They also met with the local Chamber of Commerce and local people in Shantou, who expressed that it was feasible, and the local Civil Affairs Bureau and office no longer opposed it. The personnel are now on their way to Xiamen for negotiations. However, the people of Xiamen look to the actions of the "oil head" (referring to a leading figure) as a guide. Therefore, the implementation of this matter is no longer a problem. Yesterday morning, Wang Zhiyuan, the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, received a telegram from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Therefore, he inquired about the situation from Huang Naishu by telephone. Mr. Huang explained the situation of the negotiations in various places in detail and asked for a detailed explanation in the reply telegram.</p>
<p>Labor Strike at British-American Tobacco Factory</p>
<h3 id="e123">Both Sides are Insisting <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Completion Case Has Been Submitted to Arbitration, the School Case Will Be Mediated Today</p>
<p>The Fifth District Labor Union Held an Emergency Meeting at 5 PM Yesterday</p>
<p>Eight thousand workers from the new and old British-American Tobacco factories in Pudong have been on strike since the 25th due to the factory's failure to resolve the outstanding labor-management disputes, resulting in a complete standstill of all work. On the day before yesterday, the weekly holiday, the workers did not go to the factory. The female workers of the new factory, after being refused entry by the factory, have been allowed to enter the factory after negotiations.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Submitted a Document to the Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union, submitting to the Social Affairs Bureau to continue to revise the labor-management mutual aid conditions. The original document stated, "Submitting for approval, the conditions for labor-management mutual aid that the union and the factory signed in 1927 are mostly inconsistent with the facts or lower than the current treatment. We have previously submitted a request for appropriate amendments to maintain treatment, and have been summoned for mediation. However, the union's case has been delayed for a long time and is still stagnant. Now that it is the autumn of labor-management affairs, the factory is arbitrarily destroying the conditions. It is difficult to delay the amendment for a long time. Therefore, we submit to your bureau to immediately continue to convene mediation to maintain treatment and bring the matter to an end. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Submitted to Arbitration, the Social Affairs Bureau Instructed the Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union, "For knowledge, in the case of the factory's reduction of work dispute, because mediation failed, the entire file was sent to the government to apply for arbitration. Previously, we received the Municipal Government's No. 7165 instruction stating, 'All documents are noted, and permission is granted to submit to arbitration.' You should know, this order, the file is temporarily stored, etc. Having received this, in addition to the separate order, we hereby order you to know. This order, August 26, 1933, Wu Xingya, Director of the Bureau."</p>
<p>Mediation Today Regarding labor and education matters, the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene mediation today. The day before yesterday, the union was instructed, "For compliance, in the dispute between the company's labor and management over the workers' children's school, the bureau, together with the Education Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, sent personnel to mediate. A consensus was generally reached, but there are still several unresolved points. After submitting the case to the government for instructions, we received the Municipal Government's No. 7062 instruction stating, 'All documents are noted.</p>
<p>The six unresolved points in the case have been separately reviewed and approved by the government as follows: (omitted) This order, the original file is returned, etc. Having received this, in addition to the separate notification, we hereby order you to comply and send two responsible representatives to the bureau at 2 PM on the 29th of this month to attend the mediation on time, without delay. This order, August 26, 1933, Wu Xingya, Director of the Bureau."</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting The Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union held an emergency meeting at its Pudong office at 5:20 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Approximately 150 representatives from various departments attended, with Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, and Lou Jingguan serving as the presidium.

<p>Deng Wen's Successor Was Officially Recommended by Ma</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Wu Huanzhang, Ma Zhanshan's representative, and asked about the content of Chairman Huang's meeting with Mr. Ma. According to him, Chairman Huang and Chairman Ma met for three hours, and the focus of the discussions was on two points: (1) The Ma Department in Chahar Province currently has 10,000 people. After discussion, it was agreed to transfer the department directly to the Beiping Military Branch Council, and the military pay will also be allocated monthly by the Military Branch Council. The location of the garrison will also be designated by the Military Branch Council soon, and the official relocation will take place at a determined location. (2) Regarding the resettlement of the old department, in addition to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's order to submit the names of all civil and military subordinates, it has been agreed to have the central government arrange for the resettlement of the old Heilongjiang provincial government officials and assign them to various positions, and the military officers will be assigned to various armies by Chairman Chiang. However, during the conversation with Chairman Huang, Mr. Huang also agreed to arrange for a portion to be placed in the Beiping Political Branch Council. As for the selection of a successor after the death of Division Commander Deng Wen, Chairman Chiang has ordered Ma Wenxi to recommend one of Ma's Chief of Staff Rong Yusu and the two who have been temporarily acting without authorization for the committee member to choose. Chairman Chiang, in view of Deng Wen's contribution to resolving the Chahar situation this time, will request the central government to provide generous compensation for Deng Wen's tragic death.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Dr. Millikan Tests Cosmic Rays <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Can Launch Tiny Bullets</p>
<p>Shoot at World Liners</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News says, "Today (28th), the President Garfield of the Dollar Steamship Lines, which arrived in Shanghai, was often shot at by bullets during its voyage, but these bullets were infinitely small and not fired from guns, but came from strange cosmic rays. This light often bombards the earth from distant space. Although the President Garfield is not its special target, it is noteworthy that the famous physicist Dr. Millikan of the California Institute of Technology had installed a very accurate cosmic ray detector on board, which can measure the intensity and quantity of cosmic rays. When the ship sails around the world, it can use the device to measure the effect of cosmic rays in different latitudes and longitudes, and continuously record them on film. This instrument is very simple to manufacture. It only uses a six-inch diameter steel ball, filled with atmospheric gas under 60 pounds of pressure per square inch, and an ordinary electroscope, which is charged by a battery at regular intervals. When cosmic rays penetrate the steel shell, like X-rays (i.e., X-rays) passing through the human body, this light can cause argon atoms to explode, ionize, and then cause electrical effects, causing the electroscope to partially discharge. Then, by looking at the rate of discharge, the index of the amount of cosmic rays in the area can be measured. Dr. Millikan will continuously capture these phenomena on film that is constantly running, creating a record. The film is very long and can run for four months around the earth. It not only records the movement of the electroscope, but also simultaneously records the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and time. Outside the steel ball, it is lined with a four-hour thick lead box to prevent interference from nearby radioactive substances, because cosmic rays are never hindered by lead, unlike other radioactive rays. Regarding the nature of cosmic rays, scientists are still exploring them. It is only known that they have very high transmittance and extremely high electrical potential, about more than 300 million electron volts, which is nearly a thousand times higher than other known radioactive rays on earth, such as X-rays and meson rays. Therefore, studying these extremely small and terrifying destructive bullets is an extremely important task in the scientific community today."</p>

The Public Safety Bureau's Security Division would be responsible for security, and methods and opinions had been drafted and were available for preliminary study by the committee. The publicity and decoration groups' plans had not yet been submitted. The general affairs group's plan was related to various groups due to the trivial nature of the budget and other matters and should be determined after the plans of each group were finalized. (B) Discussion Items: (1) The Shanghai Postal Administration sent a letter requesting that rooms be reserved in the new Municipal Government building for the establishment of a postal branch. It was resolved to report to the mayor, proposing to allocate one or two rooms on the west side of the ground floor of the building, with postal personnel entering and exiting through the west gate. The order and cleanliness of the building must be maintained, and there should be a way to separate the postal branch from the internal areas of the Municipal Government, or install doors for opening and closing. (2) The reception group's plan for the completion of the new building was resolved and approved with amendments. (3) The opinions and methods of the security group proposed by the Public Safety Bureau's Security Division were discussed and it was resolved that the Public Safety Bureau should consult with the Security Division and submit them for discussion and decision at the next meeting.

<h3 id="e131">Maintaining Public Security and Serving Morality <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning at the Municipal Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government held a memorial week for the Prime Minister yesterday morning. Over 300 employees from the Municipal Government and various bureaus attended. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the ceremony and reported on "Maintaining Public Security and Serving Morality." The main points are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Devote Oneself to Duty <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Fellow Comrades, the Prime Minister told us,</p>
<p>If we want to revive the Chinese nation, we must first restore our self-confidence and the inherent morality of China. Morality is the basic creed of our lives, and self-confidence is the key to our success in doing things. Where is the principle of our lives? First, we must have ambition and aspirations. Second, we must be devoted to our duties, which is to fulfill our responsibilities. Whether we are serving in an administrative agency as a civil servant, serving in the business community, or operating our own business, if everyone can be devoted to their duties and make their business successful, there must be a kind of ambition, a kind of self-confidence. In other words, if the people of the whole country, regardless of whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, merchants, soldiers, or politicians, can have this kind of ambition, this kind of aspiration, to be devoted to the duties and careers they are engaged in, I believe they will definitely succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Mourning Ma and Huang <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The reason why I want to say this today</p>
<p>is that in the past two years, comrades in the Public Safety Bureau who have been handling special affairs have repeatedly been killed by enemies because of their duties. Many have sacrificed their lives. The most prominent are Comrade Ma Shaowu and Comrade Huang Yonghua, who was recently killed. These comrades who sacrificed for their devotion to duty, because they only knew where their responsibilities lay, regardless of all interests, had the ambition and aspirations to serve the society and devote themselves to their respective duties, and finally sacrificed their lives. The sacrifice of such brave, responsible, and devoted comrades is a great loss to us, and at the same time, it can serve as a good example for a group of people, especially those of us who are civil servants. Since we are going to serve the people, we should continue their spirit of devotion to duty and courage to sacrifice, and devote ourselves</p>
<p>to our duties and complete our careers.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Encourage Subordinates <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, in the past one or two years, in the midst of this national crisis, and at the same time, the society is so complex, with many dangerous elements lurking, undermining the law and disrupting public security. They are not only plotting and destroying the peaceful order of society, creating an atmosphere of terror and unease in society, but also taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, wanting to subvert the government. Shanghai, on the one hand, is in a time of national crisis, and on the other hand, it is in such a complex and serious social situation. The maintenance of its public security should be very difficult in theory. However, the public security of Shanghai, the peaceful order of the whole territory, is not only the same as before the September 18th Incident, but also the social disputes are less than before. This fact is obvious to all and recognized by the society. Why is Shanghai able to be so stable? There are two reasons. First, the citizens of Shanghai all know the importance of Shanghai's position, and at the same time know that the safety of Shanghai is closely related to the safety of the nation. The citizens of Shanghai have this understanding and work together with the strength of the citizens of Shanghai to stabilize Shanghai. The citizens of Shanghai have this understanding and this effort, so Shanghai can be stable. This is the first reason. Second, the dangerous elements of Shanghai's reactionaries are being eliminated day by day, and the dens of conspiracy in Shanghai are being cracked down on day by day. The dangerous reactionary elements of Shanghai can be eliminated day by day, and the dens of conspiracy can be cracked down on day by day. We cannot but attribute this to the comrades in the Public Safety Bureau who are able to be devoted to their duties, and to the cooperation between the public concession, the French concession police, and the Public Safety Bureau, so that the public security of Shanghai can be maintained. This is the second reason. Because of these two reasons, Shanghai can have such stability. Here, we cannot but express our respect and condolences to the comrades who sacrificed for maintaining the peace and security of Shanghai. All these words I say today are to encourage all the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and at the same time to encourage myself.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Huang Naishu Talks About Retired Postal Workers <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 200,000 Yuan in Pensions and Other Payments Were Issued</p>
<p>Approximately 100,000 Yuan Will Be Saved in Salaries Each Year Thereafter</p>
<p>Huang Naishu, Director-General of the Postal Administration, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the bureau had laid off 32 employees to save money, which was originally done in accordance with the regulations. Unexpectedly, it caused misunderstandings among the employees and was opposed. Finally, with the Ministry of Communications' flexible method, the layoffs were changed to voluntary retirement, and two months' salary was given in addition to severance, and the issue was resolved. However, the employees said that the occurrence of the dispute was due to my tough attitude. In fact, the bureau is an executive agency, and everything must be done in accordance with the regulations. Even if there is a need for flexibility, it must be approved by the ministry. Therefore, my inability to change the method without authorization is also my responsibility, and not a desire to insist on my personal opinions, so as to make the situation deadlocked. This time, the retired employees include 8 from the Shanghai Bureau, 8 from the Fuzhou Bureau, 4 from the Nanjing Bureau, and one or two from other bureaus, a total of 32 people. A total of about 200,000 yuan will be issued for pensions and two months' salary. Approximately 100,000 yuan can be saved in salaries each year thereafter.</p>

<p>Special Tax on Domestic Tobacco</p>
<h3 id="e137">Supplements Approved to Show Flexibility <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Tax Affairs Department Replies to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, previously based on a letter from the Jiujiang Transfer Industry Association, requested that the special tax on domestic tobacco be levied in different grades, and forwarded it to the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance replied, "I have received the telegram from Jian. I have checked the previous report from the Jiujiang Special Tax Office for Domestic Tobacco, which was based on a letter from the Jiujiang Transfer Industry Association, requesting that the special tax on domestic tobacco be levied in different grades, and that existing inventory be exempted from the new tax. The Tax Affairs Department previously stated that the Susong Tobacco Industry Association and others jointly sent a telegram requesting that the newly established special tax rate for domestic tobacco leaves be supplemented by exceptions to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The Ministry of Finance stated that the cancellation of the public sales fees and taxes on domestic tobacco leaves in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian was changed to a special tax in order to simplify the process and facilitate merchants. The established special tax rate of 4.15 yuan per 100 market liters is no more than a combination of the previously levied public sales fees and taxes, unified collection, and once a collection is sufficient, it can be sold at will within the special tax area without re-collection, and the customs transit tax is also approved for exemption. The Ministry has promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Special Taxes on Domestic Tobacco Leaves, and ordered the competent bureaus in each province to comply with them uniformly from July 1 of this year. Compared with the previous public sales fees and taxes, which were based on provinces, if tobacco leaves were transported from the place of production and sale to other provinces, they would still have to be taxed at the place of sale. The convenience to tobacco merchants is very obvious. How can the merchants misunderstand and suddenly want to change the tax regulations based on the special circumstances of tobacco leaf production and sales in a corner of the country?" The office was ordered to inform them. The Jiujiang Transfer Industry Association requested that the special tax on domestic tobacco leaves be levied in different grades.</p>
<p>The review is consistent and should be interpreted and informed by the office in accordance with the case. Regarding the methods for paying the new tax and refunding the old tax on inventory after the implementation of the special tax on domestic tobacco leaves issued by the department, the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association previously stated the difficulties, and the department immediately reviewed and approved various supplementary points to show flexibility and ordered the association to inform them and distributed them to various bureaus for reference. If the original method is</p>
<p>indeed difficult to implement, the office should quickly assess the situation and refer to the supplementary points approved by the department to facilitate the procedures and submit them to the department for approval and implementation to comply with the wishes of the merchants. The office was ordered to comply. Now that the association has resubmitted the previous situation, it should be approved in accordance with the case and ordered to inform them. This approval.</p>

For the entertainment, in addition to inviting Zhang Yeye, Yi Fangshuo, Liu Chunshan, Jiang Xiaoxiao, and well-known entertainers to perform voluntarily, it is also collecting work films from various factories and anti-Japanese films to be shown every night. Many major factories have responded to the call. The association also received a letter from the Gaoyou County Public Education Experimental Zone yesterday, requesting assistance in collecting national product exhibits. The original text reads, "Our district held a National Products Exhibition for a week during the Double Tenth Festival last year, which coincided with the National Products Year and National Products Movement promotion. After the exhibition, the solicited exhibits were displayed in the National Products Exhibition Room for long-term public viewing. The exhibits solicited by our district are divided into three categories: one is gifts, one is items purchased at half price, and one is items borrowed for display. We have long admired your association as a gathering place for products from manufacturers in Shanghai and a central organization for promoting national products throughout the country. Therefore, we have sent a letter requesting assistance in soliciting exhibits. We hope that your association will help us gather them and send us a list of the product names and prices so that we can send someone to purchase them separately. We look forward to it." The association sent letters to various participating factories to assist in collecting them.</p>

<p>Box Corpse Case</p>
<h3 id="e140">Portuguese Consul Summons Witnesses This Morning <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Investigating Whether the Murderer's Brother Was an Accomplice</p>
<p>After Questioning, the Murderer Will Be Sent to Macau</p>
<p>Since the principal offender in the box corpse case, Balie, confessed to killing the Cantonese woman Zhang Cailian last Saturday, the entire case has been largely determined. Yesterday, the Portuguese Consul stated that Qiu Shifu, who assisted in transporting the body, had not yet confessed to being an accomplice, so another trial was required. Currently, the Portuguese Consul has collected reliable evidence from witnesses, such as the Japanese man Ozo, the Japanese woman Chie, residents of No. 14 Jiaxing Road, and Ma Xiaowei, an employee of a box shop on Broadway Road, regarding the purchase of the box, which is sufficient to prove Qiu Shifu's assistance in moving the body. According to Ma Xiaowei's testimony, at 8:00 AM on the 5th, a person came to buy a box and paid a deposit of one yuan. When he came to pick up the box at 11:00 AM, two people came together, indicating that Qiu Shifu also went. For fear that the foreigners would cause him trouble or retaliate in the future, he did not dare to identify him in court. The Portuguese Consul stated that regarding the issue of whether or not the accomplice was guilty, since he was trying to deny it, it was necessary for the witnesses to prove it. Otherwise, according to Portuguese law, the interrogation must be clear within 24 hours, otherwise, the person cannot be detained. Therefore, this morning, the Portuguese Consulate may summon the witnesses to re-examine whether the accomplice was present, whether he participated in moving the body, and whether he was an accomplice. After this inquiry is clarified, the criminals will be scheduled to be sent to Macau.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Autopsy of Beggar's Corpse <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Determined That Gu Kou Died of Illness</p>
<p>Gu Xiaomei and Others Interrogated</p>
<p>Gu Xiaomei, a native of Tongzhou, is 64 years old. His cousin, Gu Kou, is also in his sixties. Both of them make a living by begging in Shanghai, seeking alms from door to door to make a living. On the morning of the 21st of this month, at 11:00 AM, Gu Kou, accompanied by a beggar named Zhengming, begged to No. 142 Lan Road, in front of the Yongtai Xiang Cigarette and Paper Shop. Just as he was about to stop to ask for alms, he suddenly suffered an acute illness and collapsed, unconscious. He was immediately sent by the No. 6 Gang Police to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but he died before treatment could be provided. After investigation by the Yangshupu Police Station, it was confirmed that he was a beggar who died on the road, so the Pushan Villa was notified to prepare a coffin for collection and temporary placement. After three days, Gu Xiaomei, based on what the beggar Zhengming said, that Gu Kou was beaten to death by the owner of the Yongtai Xiang shop, deeply believed it and reported it to the police station, requesting a thorough investigation. The police chief did not pay attention to it because it had already been clarified at the time. Gu Xiaomei was not satisfied and submitted a petition to the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special District Court, requesting an autopsy. It has been approved and the police station has been notified to transport the coffin to the Phelon Road Autopsy Office to await a forensic examination in accordance with the law, and a report will be submitted for review. It is now understood that Gu Kou's remains were examined in detail by a forensic doctor yesterday, and the result was determined to be death from illness, with no other circumstances. An autopsy report was issued and sent to the Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei went to the Autopsy Office and ordered the police station to summon Gu Xiaomei and Zhengming for interrogation. The police chief submitted the Sacred Heart Hospital's diagnosis certificate for Gu Kou's diagnosis on that day, stating that the hospital had determined that the deceased was ill. Gu Xiaomei and Zhengming insisted on pointing to being beaten after the collection. Their actions had no other purpose, or they hoped to use it as an excuse for blackmail. In order to understand the content, the police station planned to investigate Gu Xiaomei and Zhengming. Prosecutor Guo Wei then ordered the Pushan Villa to handle the coffin because the body had been examined and determined to be dead from illness. The two beggars, Gu Xiaomei and others, were taken to the Yangshupu Police Station for questioning.</p>

<p>Rent Books and Sublease Books Must Be Stamped</p>
<p>Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Branch Proclamation No. 13 states, "For the purpose of proclamation, according to the Stamp Tax Regulations, all leased land should be affixed with stamps as legal proof. It is now found that the two types of rent books and sublease books issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau are for landlords in the urban area to report to the police district to which they are assigned to tenants and sublessors when they lease a house, which is an official rent receipt and should be in accordance with Article 2, Category 1, Item 11 of the Stamp Tax Regulations for land and housing leases and room tickets, and Item 13 for various cash receipts, 'If the amount is over 1 yuan but less than 10 yuan, a 1-cent stamp shall be affixed, and if the amount is over 10 yuan, a 2-cent stamp shall be affixed.' All must comply with the regulations and be affixed on each sheet. I am sincerely afraid that the landlords and sublessors do not understand the regulations, or there may be opportunistic evasion. The director of this bureau has now been ordered by the provincial bureau to supervise, assess, and strengthen the enforcement. It is my duty to rectify the levy. In addition to ordering the promoters to comply with it and sending personnel to inspect it at any time, it is hereby announced to the landlords and sublessors within the jurisdiction that they must all know that when using the above-mentioned rent books and sublease books, they must affix the stamps according to the regulations and do not evade them. Otherwise, once it is found out or reported, it will only be dealt with according to the law. Do not say that I did not warn you. Please comply with the order and do not violate it. Sincerely, this announcement. August 25, 21st year of the Republic of China, Director Xu Zhicheng."</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Shu Yuanhe, the owner of Yiqingyong Wine Shop at No. 76 Milu Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, being brutally beaten and injured by police officer No. 1154, the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate has already verified the injuries and is awaiting orders to summon the offending police officer for interrogation. However, after Shu Yuanhe returned home, his injuries suddenly worsened yesterday, with persistent fever and extreme danger. His family has notified the lawyer handling the case and has also sent Shu to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation of Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government (the beginning is omitted): The letter from Yiqingyong Wine Shop, a member store of the association located at No. 76 Milu Road, French Concession, states that at approximately 4 a.m. on the 24th of this month, a cart loaded with liquor was being transported to Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai. Just as it left the shop and passed the police亭 near the Nanyang Bridge in the Chinese territory, police officer No. 1154 suddenly appeared to inspect the tax stamps and demanded four yuan. The shop manager immediately stated to the officer that the tax system had been changed to a special consolidated tax and no further tax stamps were needed. However, the officer ignored this and took both the goods and the shop manager to the Second District Headquarters for questioning. Subsequently, after reporting to the trade association and requesting the Consolidated Tax Bureau to provide confirmation from the Second District via telephone, the manager was released at approximately 11 a.m. Unexpectedly, less than half an hour later, officer No. 1154 returned to the shop and demanded a reward of four yuan from the manager, otherwise the goods would not be released. The shop believed that the officer's actions were illegal and refused to pay. Because the officer's demands were not met, he attempted to arrest the manager. Immediately afterward, a large number of plainclothes police officers, numbering seven or eight, arrived and destroyed seven jars of Shaoxing wine in the shop. They dragged the shop manager, Shu Yuanhe, away, beating him along the way with gun butts and fists. After arriving at the Second District Headquarters, they immediately put him in shackles and imprisoned him, without sending him to a hospital. Eventually, the French Concession police sent personnel to negotiate, and the shop manager was released, but he was already severely injured all over his body. The shop believes that police officers are meant to protect merchants and maintain local peace and tranquility. However, this officer not only failed to fulfill his duty but also acted lawlessly. The merchants and residents cannot tolerate this. Therefore, the shop specifically requests the association to promptly initiate negotiations to achieve the goal of punishing the perpetrators and obtaining compensation. Based on this information, the association immediately convened a temporary emergency meeting for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the police officer was incompetent and ignorant of the law. Since the Consolidated Tax Bureau had already provided confirmation, how could he blindly demand payment and dare to brutally beat merchants, disrupting commerce? This type of action is extremely illegal. If he is not severely punished according to the law, how can the police administration be rectified and the laws be upheld? It was decided to submit a petition to the director, requesting him to order an investigation of the offending police officer and to severely punish him according to the law, in order to appease public anger and ensure local peace and stability. Therefore, a truthful petition is submitted, and it is requested that the director review it, and favorably handle the matter, for the benefit of the public, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Zhang Xingruo Accused of Encroachment on Property <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>丨Transferred to the Civil Court for Trial丨</p>
<p>Yao Renjie, a local resident, 23 years old, learned the business of money shops from a young age and later switched to the plumbing industry. He lives at No. 22, Yinxiantang Lane, Vulcan Temple, Nanshi. His birth mother, Ms. Lu, passed away in 1924. At that time, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War between Lu and Qi broke out, and the Nanshi area was unstable. In addition, Yao was only 14 years old and had not yet reached adulthood. Therefore, Ms. Lu, on her deathbed, entrusted all property deeds and evidence to her uncle, Zhang Xingruo (the son of the late famous doctor Zhang Longbi), for safekeeping. Now that Yao has reached adulthood, he wants to reclaim the property rights from Zhang. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly refused with excuses. Negotiations have continued to this day without any progress. Yao had no choice but to hire three lawyers, Zhao Zuwei, Lu Dingming, and Liu Weilun, to file a criminal self-accusation of encroachment with the First Special District Court against Zhang Xingruo, and to attach a civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the property evidence. On the 16th of this month, the First Special District Local Court held a hearing in the Fifth Criminal Chamber, presided over by Judge Huang Risheng. The defendant, Zhang Xingruo, did not appear. The court ordered a postponement of one week and instructed the plaintiff to accompany the Chinese police officer No. 2677 of the Hongkou Police Station to Zhang's residence at No. 146 Aiwenyi Road at 2 p.m. on the 21st to summon Zhang. On the 23rd of this month, the hearing was held again. The plaintiff, Yao Renjie, and the defendant, Zhang Xingruo (61 years old, from Shanghai), and the plaintiff's aunt, Zhang Yao (the wife of the defendant, Zhang Xingruo, 61 years old, from Shanghai), arrived at the court with their lawyers. Judge Huang continued the inquiry. However, the defendant denied that the plaintiff's mother had entrusted any receipts or evidence to him for safekeeping. He only admitted that the plaintiff's mother had deposited the property evidence with his wife, Zhang Yao, and that he had no knowledge of it. Zhang Yao also claimed that all the evidence had been entrusted to her by her brother (the plaintiff's deceased father) when he was dying in 1912. She also claimed that she was also entitled to a portion of the property in her own right. Judge Huang then instructed the lawyers of both parties to begin their arguments and declared the trial closed, ruling that the case was a dispute over property rights and ordering it to be transferred to the Civil Court for trial. Yao has now been instructed to continue the lawsuit in the Civil Court.</p>

<p>Family Dispute of Zhang Shiming</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, a concubine of the wealthy Zhang Shiming of Nanxun, has had disagreements with the senior wife, Zhang Xu, since Zhang's death and has been living separately. Recently, Zhou was concerned about her son, Qu'an, being surrounded by Ms. Xu, who did not allow her to participate in his marriage. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit against Ms. Xu and Qu'an to confirm their mother-son relationship. After three trials, Zhou won the case. Later, on the grounds that Ms. Xu had instigated Qu'an to not provide support, she hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Zhang Zhirang to accuse Ms. Xu of instigating abandonment in the First Special District Court. During the two trials, Zhang Xu did not appear in court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu continued the inquiry. The defendant still did not appear, and Zhou Miaoying also did not appear due to illness. Lawyer Yuan appeared in court and requested a postponement. Judge Liu approved the request and ordered a postponement for further inquiry.</p>
<p>Pan Ge'ya's Resignation Approved</p>
<h3 id="e154">Unrelated to the Escape of Niu Jinpu <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Pan Ge'ya, the chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously resigned due to a brain illness. The Director of the Cultural Bureau retained him. Now, the section chief is indeed experiencing increased brain illness due to the heavy workload of the section. After submitting his resignation for the second time, it is reported that the Director of the Cultural Bureau has approved his request, as his intention to resign is firm. The Director is currently looking for a successor. It is also reported that Pan's resignation is unrelated to the escape of Niu Jinpu, as Niu was detained in the Third Squad of the Vulcan Temple Police, which is not within the jurisdiction of the Third Section.</p>

There were also Western guests offering congratulations. Because the gifts were excellent, depositors were extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that various deposits received on that day totaled more than 1.6 million.</p>

<p>A woman named Xu Liu, hid twelve ounces of morphine on her person last Friday while traveling in the Public Concession. She was discovered by investigators and taken to the police station. She confessed that the drugs were purchased from the home of Yongren Xu Shilong at No. 3, Jiwufang, Ximen Road, French Concession. Thereupon, the Public Concession Police notified the French Concession Police, and detective Lu Zhulin, deputy detective Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, and Bao Tang Liu Jinrong of the Second Investigation Group rushed to search the premises. The old Xu Shilong had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Xu's younger brother, Xu Wenxing, the clerk Xu Weicheng, and buyers Wang Fuming, Wang Wenkui, Ding Liangcheng, Zhang Yichun, Zhang Weixin, Qiu Wenbiao, Jiang Shanqi, Wang Yousan, Zhang Fanggui, and eleven others were arrested. Five small packages of heroin, five empty tin boxes for packing morphine, coffee essence, white glue powder, one thousand yuan in silver dollars, three account books, a tin of red pill biscuits, three pill-making boards, and raw materials for red pills were seized. They were all taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Xiong Huiping. The police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated that the police had not yet completed the investigation of the case and that the principal offender was at large. He requested a postponement to arrest the principal offender and clarify the facts before requesting a hearing. He also presented the evidence to the court. The detective reported on the arrest of the defendants and the search process. The court verified the report and briefly interrogated the defendants before ordering a postponement for further investigation. The defendants were returned to the police station for detention.</p>
<p>Student Guilty of Obscenity</p>
<h3 id="e159">Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Genshou, an apprentice from Suzhou at Yifaxiang Water Shop, opposite the Shiliupu Tram Station in the French Concession, 18 years old this year, previously teased and sucked the semen of Huang Hengtai, a 15-year-old apprentice from Ningbo, more than ten times, causing his glans to swell and making it difficult for him to walk. He took leave to return to his home at No. 12, Xingyeli, Huayijie, Nanshi, to seek medical treatment. Because his trousers were stained with blood, his father, Huang Huigan, found out and argued with Zhang, who was unreasonable. Therefore, he filed a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Zhang of injury and obscenity. According to the lawsuit, the court had conducted a hearing, and forbade audiences, and concluded that Zhang must post bail to await further trial. Because Zhang had no guarantee of posting bail, he was summoned before Judge Xiong Huiping for further questioning the day before yesterday afternoon. The victim was also ordered to undergo a forensic examination. As the charge of injury could not be established, but the act of obscenity had been admitted by the defendant, the court verified the confessions and immediately announced the judgment that Zhang Genshou was guilty of obscenity and sentenced him to two months imprisonment as a warning. After the court, the defendant was returned to the detention center to await execution after the appeal period.</p>

<p>Previously, Lü Cai, a native of Ninghai, Zhejiang, who was involved in the underworld in Deshanli, French Avenue, was killed because his wife was taken by his apprentice Wang Damao. Later, Lü also took Gu Qiaozi, the lover of another apprentice, Hou Chunrong. As a result, Lü was lured by Wang and Hou to Kangti Road, French Concession, where he was hacked to death with knives and axes, suffering twenty-three axe wounds and eight knife wounds all over his body. The murderers fled the scene. Later, the police transported the body to the coroner's office. After the court verified the body and determined that there were no relatives, it was handled by the charity hall. Subsequently, the deceased's father, Lü Arong, found out and reported it to the police, who arrested Jiang Yinlong (21 years old, a razor shop assistant from Zhenglai Xing, Mofang Street, Suzhou), an accomplice in the case, and sent him to the Second Special District Court. After investigation, Jiang was sentenced to twelve years in prison for joint murder. Jiang was dissatisfied with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The court, headed by Presiding Judge Zhou, with Judges Guo and Fan and Prosecutor Zhang, held a collegial panel for the trial and declared the debate closed. The judgment was announced yesterday morning: the appellant's appeal was rejected. After the judgment, the appellant was returned to the detention center to await execution after the third-instance appeal period.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways Will Send Personnel to Inspect and Accept It in Two Days</p>
<p>The Transportation Department Plans to Move in on the First of Next Month</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai North Station was nine-tenths destroyed. After the war subsided, the two railway bureaus slightly opened a portion of the original site and repaired it to provide a place for passengers to rest. As for the entire North Station, it has been rebuilt for more than two months and was completely completed yesterday. The Ministry of Railways plans to send personnel to accept it in two days. The Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau will also move in to work on the first of next month. The entire building is magnificent. Although it only has two floors, it is tall and majestic, and the atmosphere is grand. This type of three-dimensional architecture is not common in China. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Completely Completed <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North Station was built by the Zhongnan Construction Company. From the start of construction to the present, it will take three months, with a total cost of tens of thousands of yuan. The internal layout is slightly different from the old station. The entire building is three-dimensional, and the exterior is made of large red concrete blocks. The entrance faces west, with the four large black characters "Shanghai North Station". The interior was completed earlier, but the electrical and water lines were only installed yesterday. The appearance is completely new compared to before, and it is no longer a scene of broken walls.</p>

<p>After the completion of the project, the two railway bureaus sent personnel to inspect it and found it satisfactory. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Railways on the 31st of this month (the day after tomorrow) to send personnel for inspection and acceptance. The Transportation Department of the two railway bureaus was originally located at the North Station. After the station was destroyed, a temporary and simple site was built near the Boundary Road Station for office work. With the completion of the new site, it will be moved back on the first of next month.</p>

<p>Forced Membership in Trade Associations</p>
<h3 id="e164">Should Request Administrative Agencies to Execute <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Trade Associations Write to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations previously drafted measures for compulsory membership of fellow traders, which were submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions. They have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for attention during the revision of laws and regulations. However, it was heard yesterday that the Intestine Industry, Sino-Foreign General Merchandise Industry, Cosmetics Industry, and other trade associations believe that Article 7 of the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce has been revised last year, and fellow traders "shall" join the association. The wording is affirmative, and the procedure for the case has reached the stage where administrative agencies should execute it, without the need to refer it to the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the original text of which is as follows: "To the esteemed Chamber, regarding the case, it was found on October 15, 1932, that your esteemed Chamber received a letter from the Social Affairs Bureau, No. 4640, which stated that the Municipal Government's order No. 2890 stated that the Executive Yuan's order No. 3893 stated that the National Government's order No. Lu Zi 238 stated that the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce had been formulated and promulgated, and that Article 7 of the law had been revised and should be implemented. In addition to separate orders, the revised article is hereby copied for your information and to instruct your subordinates to take note. This order includes the revised Article 7 of the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce: 'Companies and firms in the same industry shall be members of the trade association and send representatives to attend meetings, except for those who have been expelled.' It is believed that the law is the binding rule of the state, and once it is formulated, promulgated, and implemented, the administrative agencies bear the responsibility of execution, without waiting for any request. Otherwise, how can the effectiveness of the law be generated? If the law is not enforced, it will not only become a mere formality but also lose the authority of the administration. Article 7 of the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce has been revised from 'may' to 'shall,' and the wording is affirmative. Fellow traders shall join the association. In other words, administrative agencies have the power to compel fellow traders who do not join the association to join. If they are still not bound by the law, wouldn't it make the law-abiding fellow traders feel that their rights and obligations are unequal, and both the spirit of the law and the authority of the administration would be lost? Previously, various trade associations jointly drafted a proposal to urge fellow traders</p>
<p>to join the association, 'Because the people have an obligation to abide by national laws and regulations, the competent authorities should announce it, limit the time for joining the association, and, if they do not comply after the deadline, they will be prosecuted for resisting the national administrative power and forced to join the association.' The foolish opinions of our associations are deemed appropriate. Later, on June 26 of this year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a letter No. Shang Zi 18496, stating that it had been noted that the matters mentioned have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry in a separate case for referral to the Legislative Yuan for attention when revising the regulations, hoping to obtain appropriate relief measures. This order and other reasons were received. After reading it, we were shocked. It was found that Article 7 of the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce has been revised by the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government's order No. Lu Zi 238 has ordered its implementation, and the case files are available for reference. The process of referring this case to the Legislative Yuan is puzzling. It is feared that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is negligent in examining the procedures of this case, or some people say that supplementary regulations should be included in the implementation rules of the Trade Association Law in order to make Article 7 of the Trade Association Law effective. However, it is not known that the effectiveness of joining the association depends entirely on the provisions of Article 7 of the Trade Association Law, as proven by those who have already joined the association, and it has nothing to do with the implementation rules. Otherwise, all the fellow traders who have joined the association can make excuses that there are no supplementary provisions in the implementation rules and withdraw from the association. Moreover, the implementation rules are only a supporting law to the Trade Association Law. A review of the regulations revised and promulgated by the Ministry on July 25, 1930,</p>
<p>mainly regulates the organization of the association, the dispatch of members, and the subordination of government offices. At that time, the matter was just being initiated, or there were matters not specified in detail in the Association Law, so it was necessary to have these implementation rules as supplements. Now, the revised wording of Article 9 is clear, so what is the need for supplements? Or some people say that the word "shall" in Article 7 should be revised to "must" in order to solve the problem. This is an overcorrection and ignores the purpose of legislation and usage. It is important to know that the presence of the word "shall" in the law is already effective. What is the use of repeated applications with different words but the same meaning, which only reveals the pedantry of their documentary knowledge? Once a law is promulgated and implemented, it has binding effect. If fellow traders are still allowed not to join the association, those who have already joined will inevitably withdraw, and there will never be any hope for a healthy association. The so-called construction undertaking will become a mere illusion, and even the association will be disintegrated, and the foundation of the chamber of commerce will be shaken. This is not just a problem for the Shanghai area but will affect the whole country. Looking ahead, we are extremely worried. It is hoped that your esteemed Chamber, with its usual</p>
<p>wisdom, will see this early on. May we rely on your great power to dispatch representatives to petition the Executive Yuan and order the Shanghai Municipal Government to enforce it according to the previously drafted measures in order to maintain the effectiveness of the law and demonstrate the authority of the administration."</p>

<p>The Qinghai Expedition, initiated by the China Border Culture Promotion Association, departed from Shanghai in early July, passing through the northwestern provinces and entering Qinghai. The expedition lasted over fifty days. It has been learned that the expedition has completed its work. Members Gu Zhizhong, Huang Bokui, Wang Yang, Lu Yi, and Shu Yongkang, while in Lanzhou recently, took a plane to Xi'an and then traveled south by train. Except for Gu Zhizhong, Lu Yi, and Shu Yongkang, who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, Huang Bokui has returned to Nanjing, and Wang Yang has gone to Jiangxi. According to the person in charge of the expedition, Qinghai's gold deposits are the richest in the country. When passing through the banks of the Huangshui River, the glittering and dazzling gold sands are visible everywhere. It is regrettable that no one is engaged in mining.</p>

<p>Old Deeds in the Central District</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Land Bureau Urges Payment for Land Redemption <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, the new Shanghai Municipal Government building will be inaugurated on October 10th, and the office will be moved in on New Year's Day of the 23rd year. However, private construction is crucial to the prosperity of the central district, but construction is still not common. According to the Shanghai Central District Landowners Association, the land ownership certificates from the Land Bureau have not yet been fully issued. Land disputes have not been resolved, so construction is out of the question. Yesterday, reporters specifically inquired about the truth from the Land Bureau. According to staff at the Land Bureau, the Land Bureau is redeeming the old deeds held by old landowners, but many have left Shanghai or are waiting to see what happens and have not yet submitted their deeds. As a result, land ownership certificates cannot be issued rashly, to avoid disputes with two landowners for the same plot of land. However, in this situation, old landowners cannot privately transfer the land, so even if they delay in an attempt to avoid this, it is futile.</p>
<p>The Bureau has already drafted a method and submitted it to the municipal government, stating that in addition to submitting the old deeds for the expropriated land for redemption, all matters related to the ownership of the land should be handled by the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior then submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions, which has been delayed and has not yet been approved. However, recently, several people have come to the Bureau every day to submit their deeds for inspection. Once the Bureau verifies that they are correct, it will immediately issue a certificate for claiming payment, directing them to the Finance Bureau to collect the land price.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed the Two-Way Railway Bureau, stating that the various uniforms issued to employees, chiefs, and police officers of each route often lack a fixed schedule, leading to requests being submitted at the last minute or rushed purchases due to time constraints. Furthermore, each route bids for various materials, and requests the Ministry to send personnel to supervise the bidding. Sometimes, due to time constraints, the Ministry is unable to send personnel, and each route conducts its own bidding. All these situations have many drawbacks. In order to rectify this, except for various projects and materials used for driving that need to be purchased temporarily or urgently,</p>
<p>The uniforms that should be issued to employees in the vehicle and machinery departments, as well as various materials for daily use that can be purchased and manufactured on time, now have a fixed schedule and methods, which are listed separately as follows:</p>

The situation for other employees who were issued winter and summer uniforms was the same as that of the railway police. In the future, each route should manufacture and issue various employee uniforms according to the above-mentioned schedule, and submit a request for purchase in accordance with the regulations. For employee teams and police officers who are issued uniforms for both spring and autumn seasons, it is also stipulated that the period for manufacturing and issuing spring uniforms is from January to February each year, and the period for manufacturing and issuing autumn uniforms is from July to August each year. However, requests must be submitted to the Ministry for approval one month in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Various Materials <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Each route should order all materials, except in special circumstances or due to limited financial resources, that cannot be purchased and used on schedule. For those that are regularly ordered for daily use in the industrial and mechanical departments for road maintenance, each year should be divided into four periods, with three months per period, and requests should be submitted for purchase on schedule. The materials department of each route should first notify the purchasing agency of the quantity of materials needed every three months, and then the purchasing agency should submit a request for purchase in accordance with the regulations during the stipulated period. However, the deadline for submitting requests should be two months before each period. If it is necessary to order from overseas, the request should be submitted to the Ministry at least six months before each period.</p>

<p>The materials purchased by each route on its own that require the Ministry</p>
<p>to send personnel to supervise the bidding must be submitted to the Ministry for approval two weeks before the bidding. For items that have been specifically approved by the Ministry to be tendered by the route itself, the members of the bidding supervision committee should be designated in advance when the route is notified, to avoid being rushed. All the above-mentioned regulations should be implemented separately from September 3rd of this year, and the implementation situation should be reported in advance. In addition to separate orders, it is hoped that they will be strictly followed. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Year's Various Things <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>This year is a "National Products Year," which has been generally recognized. However, observing from various aspects, it seems that this year is not just a "National Products Year," because, examining the domestic situation, there are really too many events. For example, with the Tanggu Truce, the national crisis can be temporarily declared over; therefore, this year can be called "Truce Year," or "End of National Crisis Year." Now that the national crisis has ended, there is no need to "repel" externally, but it is greatly possible to "settle" internally! Therefore, this year can also be called "Internal Pacification Year." The government will seek unification through construction, and it cannot but borrow talents from other countries; thus, technical personnel from the League of Nations are about to come to China to cooperate with our country, opening a new record in our country's history. This year can also be called "League of Nations Cooperation Year." Since the opening of the aviation donation, the common people have been able to deeply understand the greater good and reluctantly loosen their purse strings. This is also a matter worthy of commemoration. If we say that this year is "Aviation Year," who would say it is inappropriate? Furthermore, our country's finances have reached the extreme of difficulty. Since the source cannot be increased, the outflow cannot but be reduced. Therefore, the expenses of various agencies are all reduced and issued; and the salaries of service personnel are discounted by 20% or 30%. Therefore, this year can also be called "Austerity Year."</p>
<p>The price cut is incredibly cheap, but American wheat has been ordered and is about to be imported; therefore, calling this year "Year of Cheap Grain" is also acceptable; calling it "Year of American Wheat Imports" is also not impossible. Advertisements for greatly reduced-price cloth attract people in the cities. It is said that Indian silk, as thin as paper, is only worth two or three jiao per foot. Other silk fabrics and daily necessities are also unusually cheap. Therefore, this year can also be called "Year of Cheap Prices" or "Year of Bargains."</p>
<p>If we say that this year is "Year of Examinations," I think a generation of future masters will nod in agreement. From graduation to further education, statistically, they have to go through three types of examinations at school: the final examination, the entrance examination, and the entrance examination for further education 丨 The various tests before graduation are not included. In addition, the higher and ordinary qualification examinations held by various provinces to seek talents for the country have already been held, and some are about to be held. Since there are so many examinations, this year can also be called "Year of Examinations."</p>
<p>There is also a "Year of Bonuses," which Rongyu Jun has already described in detail, see the ninth issue of this publication, so I will not waste any more words.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Mystery of Shanghai <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>There are many people who oppose the golden rule that Shanghai is full of gold, but there are still many people who believe that Shanghai is full of gold is an indelible saying. In Shanghai, just posting a recruitment advertisement with a brief description of the duties and a monthly allowance of ten yuan, in less than half a day, there will be bundles of application letters coming to apply. If you post an advertisement seeking a job, except for women, waiting for a year and a half, most likely no one will ask. If you take a stroll on the street, you will see countless beggars teetering on the brink of starvation, putting on a dignified appearance that is both like crying and like laughing, reaching out to people to beg for a penny's worth of alms. From the magnificent grand hotels in the evening to the entrances of small alleys without even gas lamps, they are crowded with sellers of flesh. They cannot find bread and have to trade the flesh passed down from their parents. These, though just a few examples, have everywhere exposed the poverty of Shanghai. In Shanghai, not only can you not pick up gold, but you are also in danger of being swallowed by Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, looking at the same problem from another side of society, there are different opinions. The unemployed read the advertisements, and if they can run faster than others, they can get a position with a monthly salary of ten yuan. Posting a job-seeking advertisement, if the opportunity is good, can also solve the unemployment problem, especially women's job-seeking advertisements, which are even more effective. Begging does not require capital, knowledge, or labor; as long as you can put on a face that is both like crying and like laughing, you can maintain life. These few examples have everywhere demonstrated that Shanghai is not poor and that Shanghai is full of gold. Every day, countless people who pick up gold come to Shanghai. Every day, countless people leave Shanghai with their pockets full or without picking up a single big one. Many people are loudly shouting about economic oppression and unemployment panic, but Shanghai's population is increasing year by year, and it is not often heard that people starve to death.</p>
<p>Is Shanghai really full of gold? This is truly an age-old mystery.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Psychological Testing of Women <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— A-jie</p>
<p>Psychologists only know "Child Psychology," "Criminal Psychology," and "Abnormal Psychology," as well as "Personality Type," "Subconsciousness," "Hallucination," "Illusion," "Emotion," "Concept," and so on. The psychology of women has not been thoroughly studied. Although the Chinese philosopher Li Shicen and the Russian Rasputin have deeply researched women's psychology, it is difficult to say that they have truly mastered it. Therefore, Confucius said: "Women and petty people are difficult to deal with!" Poets say: "A thousand pieces of gold cannot buy a beauty's heart." This is the reason.</p>
<p>After all, Germans have high academic knowledge. According to a Berlin telegram: "The German government has recently established a 'Women's Fashion Bureau,' which is headed by the wife of the current Minister of Propaganda and Culture, Goebbels. The bureau will hold a clothing material exhibition in mid-August, and is currently actively preparing for it. It is said that this attempt is actually to reform the psychology of modern women, arouse the characteristics of the German nation, and advance in parallel with the new German trend." From this news, isn't it possible to test women's psychology through clothing? To change women's psychology, one should start by reforming women's clothing.</p>
<p>Length can be measured; weight can be weighed; quantity can be counted; only "beauty" and "ugliness" have no standard instrument to test. Therefore, women in India and Africa also have beauties that can topple cities and countries. Male dogs look at female dogs, and roosters look at hens, and they all seem beautiful. Thirty or forty years ago, Suzhou head, Yangzhou feet, wide borders, false tails, wasn't that the standard for beautiful women's attire? Now, from short clothes and narrow sleeves, it has slowly changed to bare feet and exposed bodies. Perhaps in the near future, "nudity" will be practiced, returning to the era of the original human. What is the psychology of women? I am not a psychology expert, so I cannot answer.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is said that this is because people's hearts are changing from "pure and honest" to "shallow and frivolous," and women's virtues are changing from "chaste and virtuous" to "licentious and dissolute." I don't think so. This phenomenon is indeed a sign of civilized progress and a precursor to universal harmony. Why? For example, now foreigners can use cellulose from the plant kingdom to manufacture viscose and cellulose acetate, drawing it into extremely thin strands, which is called "rayon." Women make clothes with it, and how beautiful and lovely they are. Domestic silk fabrics have naturally become old grannies with wrinkled skin and white hair, and they are about to fall behind. If someone invents "glass silk" and studies and applies salts such as silicic acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, and tungstic acid, then its convenience will be even greater than "rayon." 1. There is no need to wash it; just burn it once with fire, and it will be like new, which is extremely suitable for the current lazy women's psychology, right? 2. Rich in carnal feeling: wearing clothes made of "glass" naturally has a rich carnal feeling, no less than the beauty of curves. Even if the authorities want to ban "nude sports," "glass clothes" can also cope with it. Isn't it extremely suitable for the current carnal women's psychology? These are all good signs of civilized progress. It is truly unjust to add the crimes of "shallow" and "licentious" to the heads of modern women!</p>

<p>— Ye Gu</p>
<p>At a friend's house, there is a female servant employed; now this female servant is sick; suffering from a very serious illness. Yellow face, listless spirit, everywhere shows that she has no strength; no strength to do the work. Logically, even if she cannot stay in the hospital for treatment, she should go back to her hometown to rest; but in fact, she has no money to recuperate, and because there is a lazy husband who smokes opium in her distant home, she has to endure the entanglement of the disease and work hard for a living!</p>
<p>Every day, early in the morning, when people are in good dreams, she gets up early, empties chamber pots, cooks breakfast, wipes tables, and sweeps the floor, non-stop. Then she buys groceries, cooks lunch, washes clothes, and cooks dinner. When the masters play mahjong, she serves them during the day, and she also serves them late at night, until the masters go to sleep, and then she goes to sleep! The next day, it's like this again, doing heavy work like cattle and horses!</p>
<p>Oh! Although she is sick now, so sick that she has no strength at all; but for her own life and the life of her husband, she has to endure the sick body and work! If she doesn't work, there is no food to eat; and who will do the work for the masters? If she hires a substitute, the wages belong to someone else; then what about herself?</p>
<p>Oh! I really don't know how many poor people there are in the world! Poor people! For every day's life, if they don't work and don't labor, there is no food to eat; therefore, every day, they have to sell their strength, their body! To do heavy work like cattle and horses!</p>
<p>Oh! Poor people, laborers who sell their physical strength, should not be able to get sick; if they get sick, they cannot work; for a living, even if they are sick, they have to work; then, in the end, it is a dead end!</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Conferring Marriage is Difficult, Hesitating and Worrying About the Future. Inviting Friends to a Small Gathering to Observe the Shameless Past</p>
<p>After reading it, Zhao Ziqiang said: Old Guan, you are really unreasonable. How come you haven't been back for half a month? There are rules in the military camp that you should go home twice a week. You have a family but don't care about it, and you have time but don't go. It's unreasonable. Guan Yaowu said: It's not unreasonable at all. Think about it, the days are still short now. Leaving the camp at six o'clock, I have to run with my legs open to catch up with getting into the city. That's all. Going back to the camp at six o'clock the next day, how can that be done? It's not even dawn yet. Zhao Ziqiang said: Can't you bring your family to Haidian? Guan Yaowu shook his head and said: I simply don't want to go home. What's the point of bringing my family here? Going back is the wife nagging, the children吵闹, and it makes me feel irritable. It's better to just mess around in the camp. My family now, including adults and children, needs a total of forty or fifty yuan a month to get by. Think about it, the salary can't be paid monthly, and I have to take out this much money a month. How much money can I spend myself? This family is really exhausting me. Zhao Ziqiang said: Since you don't love your family that much, why are you so enthusiastic about setting me up with a match? Guan Yaowu laughed and said: What am I enthusiastic about? Didn't you come to me time and time again to persuade me? The inspection committee is coming soon, let's go. As he said this, he sighed and went downstairs. Zhao Ziqiang was disappointed and somewhat lost, and had to go back to his company. The inspection lasted for a total of seven days, and today was the last day of the hygiene inspection. The inspection committee arrived at Zhao's company, took a look, saw the bedding on the floor covered with snow-white cloth, the toilets lined with snow-white lime, and yellow soil sprinkled on the sidewalks. Their faces showed a happy expression, and they left. Zhao Ziqiang thought that he had been busy for half a month: it was all for this half-hour of showiness. Thinking about it, it's really boring. Even someone like Guan Yaowu, who is unwilling to spend money, also took out the money from his pocket to pad the expenses. It can be seen that this idea of ​​being competitive is something that no one can break. (172)</p>

<p>If we go to Paris, France in the summer, we can see the various drinks of people from different countries. For example, if French and German people are thirsty, they like to drink beer with a little alcohol the most, so their tables are full of beer bottles. British people like to drink warm tea, Spanish and South American people only drink warm coffee, and Americans especially like to drink iced tea and iced coffee, and often add lemon juice, orange juice, etc. This is probably because people from different countries have different preferences.</p>

<p>Re-election of Directors and Determination of the Location of the Next Annual Meeting</p>
<p>Shen Honglie's Reception and Tour of Famous Attractions</p>
<p>丨Members from Qingdao to Jinan丨</p>
<p>(Qingdao, 28th) All members of the Economic Society left Qingdao for Jinan at 7:00 AM on the 28th. Peng Xuepei left earlier last night due to official business. Naini Guang and Zhou Zuomin stayed in Qingdao due to business matters. President Ma Yinchu said that he was very impressed with Qingdao's construction achievements and was especially grateful for the thoughtful hospitality. (Jinan, 28th) Members of the Chinese Economic Society, including Ma Yinchu and Chen Qicai, arrived in Jinan with more than 50 people. Han, the head of the Finance Department, and the Mayor of Jinan went to the station to greet and welcome them. Ma and Chen got off the car to visit Han. Chen will return to Beijing tonight. Ma and others are scheduled to visit Mount Tai on the 29th and then return south. Two public associations and the provincial government will host banquets in stages. The 10th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held at 2:00 PM on August 26 at the Science Museum of Shandong University. Li Quanshi presided over the meeting. Secretary Xu Zhaosun, Accountant Xu Jilian, and Foundation Accountant Wang Guanghua (represented by Xu Zhaosun) successively reported the general situation of the past year. It was resolved that the ordinary accounting should be reviewed by Wu Shirui, and the foundation accounting should be reviewed by Pan Xulun. Next, Li Quanshi reported on the expenses and editorial affairs of the Economic Quarterly. It was resolved that the expenses of the Quarterly should be reviewed by Liu Dajun.</p>
<p>Re-election of Directors: The society has a total of nine directors, and one-third are re-elected each year. The three whose terms expired this year were Jia Shiyi, Zhang Gongquan, and Li Zhaohuan. Liu Tingmian was appointed by the chairman to call the votes, and Wu Yugan and Yang Yinpu recorded the votes. As a result of the vote, Li Zhaohuan, Wang Yunwu, and Jin Guobao were elected as directors. Yang Yinpu, Tang Qingzeng, and Zhou Zuomin, who received the next most votes, were elected as alternate directors.</p>
<p>Location of the Next Annual Meeting: The locations for the 11th Annual Meeting next year were determined to be Chongqing, Wenzhou, and Beijing. The board of directors will select one of them to hold the meeting at that time. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Shen's Reception: At noon on the 26th, various Qingdao agencies, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, the Qingdao Customs, the Unified Tax Bureau, the Salt Affairs Audit Office, etc., jointly hosted a banquet at the Yingbin Hotel. At 7:00 PM, Mayor Shen Honglie hosted a dinner at the Yingbin Hotel. During the dinner, Shen delivered a speech, first stating that Qingdao Port has unique advantages in terms of favorable natural conditions and geographical location, and was only recovered after being managed by Germany and Japan for 20 years. Whether the municipal administration is well-managed is the key to the speed of recovery of other concession areas. Therefore, the development and prosperity of Qingdao should concentrate the talents and financial resources of the entire country to achieve it. Next, he described the recent political and economic construction of Qingdao. Seven construction offices have been set up in the rural areas. The municipal government and various bureaus send people to inspect and investigate each district every week. The work of the staff in each office is mostly to go out to guide farmers in the field. They strive for practicality in their work. In recent years, there has been no separation between the top and bottom levels, and they have learned a lot about the hardships of the people. In terms of economy, the rural land tax revenue is more than 80,000 yuan per year, while the expenses for rural construction and agricultural improvement experiments reach more than 300,000 yuan. Regarding its effectiveness, for example, about 80,000 pear trees were planted in the city. In the past two years, they did not bear fruit due to insect pests. After the government injected pesticides last year, they have borne fruit this year. On average, each tree is worth four yuan, totaling more than 300,000 yuan, which is a small compensation for the farmers. 2. In the urban area, they have recruited leaders and talents from all walks of life to engage in autonomous construction and set up places to accommodate opium addicts, beggars, and petty thieves, so the public security is relatively calm. Citizens can indeed leave their doors unlocked at night. In terms of economy, 180,000 yuan was spent to build the Fifth Wharf, and the old wharves and warehouses were repaired. The land in the factory area is stipulated that only national product factories can buy it. They are doing their best to build Qingdao in terms of both manpower and material resources. However, the matter is of great importance, and it is beyond the ability of one place to handle. They hope that talented and powerful people from all over the country will invest in development. Moreover, the people of our country have very low desires for life and are very耐苦. Generally, they hope to live and work in peace. Although Qingdao is difficult to be called楽業, the people can still安居. At the beginning of my tenure, I vowed not to increase donations and taxes. Since taking office, I have exempted many harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes that are harmful to the people, and there are absolutely no increases. This can be gratifying. Later, Chen Qicai delivered a speech of thanks, saying that the Qingdao Mayor is indeed doing things for the people alone, which is unprecedented in the country.</p>
<p>Tour and Visit: On the morning of the 27th, the Qingdao Municipal Government hosted a tour of the Licun Model Village and then went to Laoshan for sightseeing. On the morning of the 28th, they took a Jiaoji Railway train to Jinan. On the 29th, they visited famous attractions such as Daming Lake and Baotu Spring, and were entertained by the Shandong Provincial Government and the Jinan Municipality. That night, they went to Tai'an. On the 30th, they visited Mount Tai. That night, they went to Qufu. On the 31st, they visited places such as the Confucius Forest. That night, the Beijing-Shanghai members took the train south.</p>

<p>Annual Meeting of the China Library Association</p>
<h3 id="e208">Proposal for Circulation Library of Shen Bao <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Use Postal Delivery to Deepen the Circulation of Books into Rural Areas</p>
<p>Compile "Reading Guidance" to Guide Out-of-School Youths</p>
<p>The Circulation Library of Shen Bao has been established for less than a year, and it has spared no effort in supporting social and cultural undertakings, so the results are remarkable, and it is praised by the people of this city. The China Library Association is holding its second annual meeting in Beiping. Based on the previous experience of the library, it believes that the most urgent task to be carried out now is to submit the following two proposals to the association. The reporter found the original manuscript and quickly recorded it here.</p>
<p>(1) Library undertakings should be actively promoted to popularize them in townships and towns in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>A. Reasons: There are three instruments for promoting culture today: newspapers, magazines, and books. There are two tools for promoting them: schools and libraries. However, the nature of libraries is different from that of schools. The purpose of schools is to cultivate talents, and the mission is to enlighten and instruct. Except for the enlightenment and instruction, other research is not involved, and those who are economically distressed are not involved. Libraries are different. Regardless of wealth or poverty, regardless of class, they uniformly provide the intelligence and opinions needed. This is what is meant by "education without discrimination." This is known to everyone. However, there are more libraries in cities, the facilities are more complete, and the collection of books is more abundant. As for smaller county towns, due to financial constraints, even if there are any, there are only one or two, and the facilities are inevitably simple and crude. As for the towns, it is difficult to find one or two out of thousands, let alone the countryside. This is not because people in rural towns cannot read, nor is it because people in rural towns do not like to read. It is simply because there are no such cultural institutions in remote areas. Our country is based on agriculture, and although there are no accurate statistics on the population of rural areas and cities, the ratio is roughly seven to three. Therefore, promoting rural education should be more important than urban education. In recent years, people who are concerned about the times have shouted the slogan "Go to the countryside," the calls are getting louder, the publicity is getting wider, and the promotion is sparing no effort. However, farmers are limited in their knowledge, and many still superstitiously believe in the authority of gods. Common sense is lacking and reason is blocked. Even if we want to reform them, they are used to their old habits, and the effect is very small. Therefore, popular books can circulate in townships and towns, so that their erroneous views can be subtly changed, and then given appropriate guidance, they will not be resisted. This move can create a large number of soldiers among the farmers themselves, which is especially important, and the progress of the country also relies on it. B. Methods: (1) In addition to the existing public and private libraries, establish book circulation points in each district and township, attached to the district office and other public places, which should be equipped with newspapers, magazines, and popular books, etc., for the exclusive use of township and town residents and farmers to come to the society or borrow back for reading. This method should be submitted to the Ministry of Education to order the education bureaus of each county to organize it in a unified manner, so that it can be implemented conveniently and easily achieve practical results. The above method is time-consuming and will definitely not be completed in a short period of time. Before the establishment of libraries in various rural districts, postal delivery can be used. If it can be handled perfectly, then wherever the postal route reaches, the library undertaking will be promoted, and the effect will be very great. At the same time, it should be presented to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transportation in the name of the National Library to order the national post office to provide various conveniences for any library to send or return books, and the postage should also be reduced to the greatest extent. It concerns the promotion of culture and education, and the authorities will surely approve it. Regarding postal book delivery, it is said that the Zhejiang Private Circulation Library has already implemented it. This library is currently in the trial stage in this city. (3) If this method is agreed upon and happily adopted by libraries across the country, then there is a further method that can divide national libraries into several regions according to the number of books in the collection, the convenience of transportation, and the distance from the location. Within each region, designate one or several libraries to be used exclusively by any public in that region. As for the regulations, deadlines, guarantees, etc., they can be determined separately according to the local environment and different situations. (4) If a book is unique to a library in one region and another region needs to read it, it can be borrowed from each other in the name of the library. If it is a rare or out-of-print edition, a copy can be made to respond to it. If the above method is put into practice, then even in places where the atmosphere is closed, one can enjoy the ointment of knowledge. Compared with the patrol book cart, which only facilitates readers in nearby areas, its significance is extraordinary. Is it appropriate, please wait for public decision.</p>
<p>(2) Libraries should jointly compile "Reading Guidance" as a criterion for readers.</p>
<p>A. Reasons: Ancient and modern classics are vast like the sea. Since the European winds have gradually moved eastward, scholars have been diligently studying Eastern and Western academics, so there are more and more writings and translations are constantly emerging. Beginners, although they are determined to study a certain discipline, have a feeling of being at a loss. In the end, blind people and blind horses pick up at will, and once they encounter a setback, they abandon it immediately and change to another discipline, and so on. Is it not a great pity that there are those who do not succeed in their lives? However, if you want to correct this shortcoming, you can only compile "Reading Guidance", from shallow to deep, step by step, so that readers can follow it and not waste time. However, this matter is of great importance, and no one can be competent without special expertise, because every word and sentence is of great importance to the reader, so it cannot be done hastily. B. Methods: (1) Elect specialists from among the members to take on difficult tasks. Those who are good at social sciences will be assigned to social sciences, and those who are good at natural sciences will be asked to take on natural sciences. (2) If there is a lack of such talent among the members, hire experts with advanced knowledge to take on the task. (3) The arrangement of "Reading Guidance" must be divided into two categories: "required reading" and "reference." Each category is divided into several subjects, and the arrangement of book titles for each subject must be from shallow to deep. Each book title must be accompanied by a concise summary. The book titles listed in this "Reading Guidance" should be the essential books, and libraries across the country should have one or several copies prepared for readers to read. If it can be compiled properly, then readers will be like sailing the sea and getting a compass, and reading each book can be done with half the effort and twice the result. Is it appropriate, please wait for public decision.</p>
<p>High School or Above</p>
<h3 id="e209">Buglers Should Be Set Up to Benefit Military Training <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Ordered All Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed the middle schools in this city that the Ministry of Education instructed in its No. 700 order, "According to the report from the military instructors of various schools, the bugle sound is also a kind of education, so students often urge and use buglers, but because the plan does not have this provision, most schools seem to be missing it. It is proposed to order the setting up of buglers to benefit military training." It is said that the use of bugle sound is originally to regulate advances and retreats, discipline, neat steps, uniform work and rest, and maintain the order of the entire army at ordinary times. It represents the transmission of orders in battle, so it occupies an important position in the military organization. Now that military education has been implemented in high schools and above, military courses should uniformly use bugle sound so that students have a common sense of bugle sound, and the equipment of buglers is indispensable. According to the previous situation, we should consult and ask you to inform all high schools and above to comply. At least one bugler must be set up in each school (in addition to blowing the bugle sound, the bugler is also responsible for cleaning and keeping weapons and performing various duties with the military instructor) to benefit military training and hope to see changes. Furthermore, if all work and rest in the school can uniformly use the bugle sound to cultivate students' military life, it would be even more appropriate. Please also inform, etc." According to this, it is found that the bugle sound is a kind of military education, so that students can understand the bugle sound. Each school can add a bugler to play the bugle and be responsible for all duties in military training. In addition to consulting and replying and issuing orders, it is ordered that the bureau instruct the public and private high schools and above under its jurisdiction to handle the matter as appropriate, etc. The third batch.</p>

<p>The Alumni Association of National Jinan University will hold its annual meeting next month. At the same time, it will welcome newly graduated students and invite celebrities to give speeches and the president to give instructions. At that time, students from Shanghai and other places will enthusiastically participate. If there are any proposals, they should be submitted in writing to the Standing Committee Wang Weiyin (No. 2, Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road) before September 5th so that they can be sorted out and submitted to the conference for discussion. In addition, the person in charge of the association is now contacting various merchants for gifts for distribution to the members at the meeting. It is said that most of the members of the association are children of overseas Chinese and sons of industrial giants, and they pay close attention to the industry and commerce of the motherland. If merchants donate various products to the association, it is a good way to promote domestic products and the only good way to promote overseas trade.</p>

<p>London Special Correspondence: A Record</p>
<h3 id="e218">Tuesday (July 4th) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Today's temperature is even higher, reaching 85 degrees, the air is dry, with little moisture. Today's matches were relatively less important, and the audience dwindled from its peak, all preparing to return on Wednesday to watch the men's singles quarterfinals and other crucial matches. The first match did not finish until 8:30 PM. The central court was only half full after half a day of matches, yet there were still many empty seats.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ms. Round's victory, England gained a position in the women's singles quarterfinals. Her opponent was Ms. Van Leo, who succumbed in two sets, winning only five games in total. However, the situation wasn't so straightforward. Round seemed unhappy in the first set, until the Italian woman took a 3-1 lead, after which Round rallied, making it 5-3 and then 6-3. Round's shots lacked power and were too soft, allowing her opponent to often answer and return the best shots. Once Round took the lead, she suddenly perked up and gave it her all. Ms. Van Leo's shots were heavy and powerful but not practical. Round gritted her teeth and proved even better than Van Leo.</p>
<p>The match between Ms. Jacobs and Mrs. Mathieu on the central court was a feast of excellent tennis skills for the audience. Jacobs won the first set 6-1, and then Mrs. Mathieu responded in kind. This match was a struggle between chops and drives. Jacobs took a more offensive approach, using serves, volleys, and smashes to counter Mathieu's baseline drives. After Mrs. Mathieu got the ball with her forehand, her returns were so skillful, almost on par with men's tennis. The ball traveled straight and fast. Although Mathieu didn't often approach the net, she could also smash. Although both the first and second sets were one-sided, the competition was fierce. If there was an opening, they would immediately seize it to attack. In the third set, both players performed very well. Jacobs broke serve, taking a 2-0 lead. Such winning serves were commonplace and not considered too much. Once, Jacobs missed an easy smash, almost causing disaster, but she rallied and broke her opponent's serve again, making it 4-2. In the end, Mathieu failed with a double fault on her serve. The result of the match was as it should be; Jacobs was fresher and made almost no mistakes. Such thoughtful play, even from a woman, should be commended.</p>
<p>England's most promising female tennis player, Ms. Round, wins a spot in the Wimbledon singles final.</p>
<p>The match between Ms. Krawinkel and Ms. Skreven followed, but the level of play was noticeably lower, by nine-tenths. Both sides stood at the backcourt and drove the ball. Initially, it was interesting, but it later became monotonous. Skreven's forehand drive was her distinguishing feature. Apart from her powerful drive, which was often followed by approaching the net and scoring, there was little else commendable. Krawinkel's valuable experience gave her a significant advantage. In the first two sets, the scores were even. Skreven was at her peak during her final period of victory, running swiftly and reacting quickly. Her shots spun over the net. Apart from her forehand drive and the occasional smash, Skreven lacked training in other types of shots, which was truly a pity.</p>
<p>The men's doubles matches were numerous, bizarre, and unpredictable. Pan-Ly-Hughs lost to Bowers-Shang-Si-Yang in five sets. Seeder-Stauffen suffered the same fate against Oliver and Hake-Lof-Totte. The two matches were held simultaneously, one on the central court and one on the first court. Bowers was the best of the four. Hughs-Shang-Si-Yang was weak and prone to errors, as was Pan-Ly. The English team was eliminated in the fifth set, losing 6-4.</p>
<p>Seeder-Stauffen lost the first two sets consecutively, the second set by 6-2. After that, all their efforts were in vain. Seeder was poor in all aspects for the most part, and although he exerted himself with all his strength, his judgment was a major flaw, and he lacked creativity. Stauffen was better, but on Stauffen's side, many line calls were incorrect. Oliver deserves the most credit, leading his partner and never being frustrated or disappointed. Hake-Lof-Totte was a tall and energetic Englishman who was lackluster in the first two sets but gradually improved later, often seen hitting the ball hard. The two Americans did not surrender easily, especially in the fourth set, with a score of 9-11. Once, Stauffen missed a shot and, turning around, threw his racket at the net. The racket tumbled across the ground for over twenty feet.</p>
<p>The second match scheduled was Thorm-Bill-Quist-Totte against Ander-Lay-Strandt-man, the conquerors of Van-Nes-Gran-Hill. They won the last two sets consecutively, making it very pleasant. Baugh-Lo-Ku-La-Bul-Lu-Ning's match against Crawford-Mack-Gray-Siss took place after 7 o'clock, with the outcome decided in four sets. Although Baugh was not very good, he managed to maintain his advantage. Baugh's support of Bul-Lu-Ning was greatly applauded, and his shots were superb. Overall, the French team will still retain the championship. Mack-Gray-Siss was completely useless except for the third set. On the court, he seemed confused. The ratio of Crawford's good shots to bad shots was about three to one, but Crawford ultimately could not bear the entire burden.</p>
<p>Sato and Van-Nes were guests at this match. From now on, Sato will surely know what Crawford is like.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Ping Pong Team Suffers First Crushing Defeat in Shanghai <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Lost to Guangdong Team 3-4</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Eastern Ping Pong Team played against the Guangdong Ping Pong Team, the recent champions of the Ai Yueh Cup, Struggle Shield, and Zhong Dao Cup in Shanghai last night (the 27th) for the Mei Hua Cup Championship at the Jingwu Basketball Hall. The two sides were evenly matched, and the competition was full of highlights, causing the 600 fans to cheer repeatedly. As a result, Guangdong defeated them 4-3, marking the Eastern Ping Pong Team's first defeat in Shanghai. In the first match, Lu Zhongqiu of Guangdong used bold and powerful strokes to defeat Deng Guofu, the pillar of the Eastern team, 3-0. In the second match, Cheng Zhihong of Guangdong used his mortar-like drive shots, leaving Huang Anbang flustered and defeated him in straight sets. In the third match, Chen Feiwen of Guangdong used his patient drive shots to defeat Zhu Jiji of the Eastern team, taking two hours and sixteen minutes, breaking the record for the longest match time in Shanghai. The seventh match was the deciding match, as the Eastern team had won back sets four, five, and six. Rong Deneng of Guangdong and Ruan Yaohui of the Eastern team (the recent Hong Kong champion) each faced the challenge with a determination to win or die. One chopped and one drove, making for an extremely tense match. Ruan initially took a 2-0 lead, but at this critical moment, Rong Deneng redoubled his efforts and sharpened his focus. He chopped even better, eventually winning 3-2. The Guangdong team then emerged victorious. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong　　Eastern　　Result</p>
<p>Lu Zhongqiu　　Deng Guofu　　3-0</p>
<p>Cheng Zhihong　　Huang Anbang　　3-0</p>
<p>Chen Feiwen　　Zhu Jiji　　3-2</p>
<p>Lin Rongji　　Jiang Zhentao　　1-3</p>
<p>Mo Beihong　　Yi Jingguang　　1-3</p>
<p>Lin Murong　　Chen Dehui　　1-3</p>
<p>Rong Deneng　　Ruan Yaohui　　3-2</p>

<h3 id="e226">Ode to Sleep Sickness <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that a type of sleep sickness is prevalent in America, spreading rampantly. Although I don't quite understand the symptoms, judging from the name of the disease, I find it to be a rather delightful ailment.</p>
<p>First, if the germs that cause this illness, similar to a fever, are researched and neutralized appropriately for injection, then those suffering from insomnia will no longer have to worry about not being able to sleep.</p>
<p>Second, for those who are afraid of their wives, who can't get things done, who suffer from seasickness, or who encounter misfortune, wanting a temporary reprieve, they can also enjoy the pleasure of sound sleep. The ideal in the famous short story "Rip Van Winkle" by American author Washington Irving can now be effortlessly realized, wouldn't that be a joyous thing?</p>
<p>However, people's fear of this sleep sickness seems to stem from the fear of falling asleep and never waking up. This, I think, is just a shortsighted view stemming from a lack of foresight. To those who can see things clearly, there is no significant difference between a long sleep and a short nap. For example, our modern-day compatriots in Greater China, who are immersed in opium and gambling, in fine wine and women, in money, power, and status, once they become addicted, when will they ever wake up?</p>
<p>The summer holidays are over, and the cool season of early autumn is approaching. I hope that all my compatriots, both high and low, who are enthusiastic about fame and fortune, competing in the martial arts and literary circles, can seek out some sleep sickness germs to enjoy a good sleep and rest. This is much simpler and more convenient than going all the way to Lushan Mountain or spending lavishly in Qingdao to escape the summer heat.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Eventful July <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Jianwen's "Random Talk about July," which lists the past events of the Double Seventh Festival, Bon Odori, etc., I can't help but feel nostalgic; but past events are just past events, after all, not reality. Looking back at the reality of July, it still makes people frown. Living in a lane house in Shanghai, it is impossible to see how the Cowherd and Weaver Girl are whispering sweet nothings beside the Milky Way, and the modern girls sweating beside the machines, struggling for a few dimes of wages, are of course even more unable to ask for skill. The rich and powerful men on the street are organizing temple fairs, holding a donation book and going door-to-door to solicit donations. The momentum is almost the same as the apportionment of military expenses in the countryside. It's really not a joyous festival. When I was a child, I heard adults say that in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, the King of Hell would show great kindness and release all the little ghosts locked in the eighteen layers of hell, allowing them to stir up trouble in the human world. Especially those who died violently would take this opportunity to look for a scapegoat, so July is an ominous month, often with rampant epidemics and widespread deaths. When the lives of ordinary people are suddenly invaded, they can only show no resistance and prepare good wine and meat to treat them, hoping to reduce some disasters, which is the purpose of holding the Ullambana Festival. The impermanent scolding of dogs in the Ullambana Festival was my favorite thing to listen to when I was a child. It is said that evil ghosts are afraid of impermanence. Although impermanence is scolding dogs, evil ghosts will also avoid it when they hear it. But in our current era, although the human world is so chaotic, the King of Hell in the underworld seems to be holding on to a consistent policy of laissez-faire, not only in July, but actually releasing those five funeral evil ghosts all year round to run rampant everywhere in the human world, causing unbearable disturbances. The common people are providing them with even the last drop of blood and flesh. The Ullambana Festival has been held countless times, but impermanence and evil ghosts are of the same kind, and they only know how to eat the good wine and meat of the common people.</p>
<p>Regarding July, my hometown also has a saying:</p>
<p>"Worrying day and night, especially worrying about the fifth watch of July 23rd."</p>
<p>This is because storms and floods are prone to occur in July, and it is said that the fifth watch of July 23rd is the moment to determine the good or bad fortune of the year. This year, the Yellow River has already breached its banks, and there are already major floods in Shandong and Jiangbei; in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are droughts and locust plagues. The good or bad luck of the year does not need to be predicted at the fifth watch of July 23rd.</p>
<p>From this point of view, July is still an eventful month. However, according to the elders, on July 30th, the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva opens his eyes, and the little ghosts must from then on restrain their tracks, and the osmanthus blooms in August, with clear skies and refreshing air, there should be a different scene. Then, let's wait for this "July 30th."</p>
<h3 id="e228">At Dusk <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Kang De</p>
<p>As twilight silently rises, the pedestrians on the street, who were originally leisurely strolling, become a bit scattered: they are going back to their homes to rest.</p>
<p>I first look at the much quieter street, then slowly wander a few steps, following the flight path of the tired birds returning to their nests, back to my lodging. The lodging is in a small alley at the end of a secluded lane. The room is not very small, but it is as dilapidated as a withered temple.</p>
<p>Few people walk down the secluded lane, and in the small alley, apart from the rustling sound of fallen leaves, there is only the frantic barking of stray dogs crouching in the darkness upon hearing the sound of footsteps. This sudden, unprovoked barking of stray dogs always makes me feel uneasy. I originally tried to lighten my footsteps when walking into the alley, and walked quickly: but the dog's hearing is as sensitive as its sense of smell. I thought I was walking so lightly that there was no sound, but it still suddenly barked, so I lost the ability to lighten my footsteps, and instead ran wildly with big strides, and it barked even more fiercely. I would still feel my heart pounding until I walked straight into the room and closed the door.</p>
<p>The landlord's family had already eaten dinner and were gathered under the lamp, chatting about everyday life with their children and daughters-in-law. The children, chirping and singing like little birds, would call out "Uncle, uncle" when they heard footsteps, followed by the landlord's kind "You're back, haven't you eaten yet?"</p>
<p>I mumbled a response, walked into the pitch-black room, and first fumbled for the matches I had forgotten where I had put them; after much bumping and stumbling, I finally found them. After lighting them, I shone them on the oil lamp, and I could see that only a dead snake-like wick was lying stiffly inside the transparent lamp belly. The oil was gone. A wave of irrepressible annoyance washed over me, and I stared blankly at the oil-less lampstand until the embers of the match burned my fingertips. I threw away the matchstick and sat silently in the darkness, the sound of the evening wind outside seemed to be blowing on my heart.</p>
<p>"The kerosene is gone, right? Come over here and take some to use."</p>
<p>The landlord's words were carried over with the sound of opening the long window. I politely declined her kindness, and immediately fumbled for the kerosene bottle and hurried out with my head down. I was afraid that if I sat there any longer, the tear stains on my cheeks would fall into her eyes.</p>
<p>The night wind was so cool, and the clothes on my body were so thin. I walked with my hands clasped in my sleeves, holding the kerosene bottle, only my own thin shadow under the dim streetlights accompanying me.</p>
<p>My body and heart were trembling a little.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Embryo of Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Ma Zhiyuan was one of the most prominent literati of the Yuan Dynasty, with both Zaju and Sanqu being called unparalleled. I believe that his Zaju, such as "Breaking the Dream of the Lone Goose, Autumn in the Han Palace," (the above two dramas are found in the Yuanqu Xuan) "Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao Mistakenly Entered Peach Blossom Spring," (a fragment is recorded in the Northern Lyrics Guangzheng Spectrum, etc.) and "Meng Haoran Walking in the Snow to Seek Plum Blossoms," etc., already had embryos when he composed the Xiaoling. Here are the Xiaoling related to these four dramas:</p>
<p>(1) Meng Qingyang, why so exuberant, riding a donkey frozen on the Ba Bridge. Even if there are some plum blossoms entering the dream, it is not as good as the wind and snow melting the golden tent, slowly sipping and softly singing. (Bo Buduan) (Tune title)</p>
<p>(2) Herb-collecting boy, riding a phoenix guest, resentful of Liu Lang leaving Tiantai. When will the spring breeze come again? The peach blossoms bloom but cannot be eaten, poor scholar with a thin life, who told you to return? (Four Pieces of Jade, Tiantai Road)</p>
<p>(3) Geese flying north, people looking north, abandoning the beautiful Mingfei, the Han emperor and the Xiongnu singing, green grass, is thinking of hometown! (Four Pieces of Jade, Zizhi Road)</p>
<p>(4) Seeing off guests, autumn red cold, singing girl pipa heartbroken. Do you know that Sima listened with sorrow. The moon is bright again, the wine is awake again, the guests just woke up. (Four Pieces of Jade, Xunyang River)</p>
<p>The first song above is the embryo of "Walking in the Snow to Seek Plum Blossoms," the second song is the embryo of "Mistakenly Entered Peach Blossom Spring," the third song is the embryo of "Autumn in the Han Palace," and the fourth song is the embryo of "Qingshan Lei."</p>
<p>The play "Qingshan Lei" shows great respect for Meng Haoran, saying "Meng Haoran is a guest on the Ba Bridge, seeking plum blossoms in the snow" (first act, Jin Zhan'er), and also saying "his poems surpass Meng Haoran" (second act, Tang Xiucai). Perhaps the play "Walking in the Snow to Seek Plum Blossoms" had already been inspired at this time? As for Meng Haoran dying in 740, and Bai Juyi being born thirty-two years later, why should they be blamed for talking together in the same hall? That can be ignored, because a play is ultimately a play, otherwise, unrelated prostitutes would not have been lovers before Bai Juyi. The plot of a prostitute marrying a tea merchant and the moonlit night weeping with the pipa is very similar to "Shuang Jian Ganting Suqing," perhaps influenced by this story to some extent, which is also unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Women (5) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>She smiled as she looked at the fog. She remembered the thin web of worldly affairs that covered her heart. Yesterday at dusk, she had sat with a female companion on a rock by the sea, listening to the murmur of the waves. One wave after another crashed beneath the rocks. The girl was only seventeen years old and in love with the son of a pastor. The pastor's son, however, thought of her as just a child, and all her plans were based on childish confusion and naivety, bearing no resemblance to what reality would allow. The pastor's son had hurt her heart. She recounted everything, saying that if he continued to treat her like a child, she would prepare to kill herself to show him. She asked the girl, "If you kill yourself, will he understand? Besides suicide, is there no other way to make him understand? And is it even real love? Even if your love for him is genuine, what good qualities does this person actually have?" The girl remained silent for a long time, then raised her head with a shy look and replied, "I don't even know what's going on myself. All his good qualities seem to be found in the character of other boys, but my love for him seems to be solely for that part of his pride where he ignores me. I love that bit of pride." At the time, she thought this girl was truly a child.</p>
<p>But now she had an opportunity for reflection. She did not understand the girl's feelings, and now she was trying her best to seek out the starting and ending points of these feelings.</p>
<p>Too many people loved her, but she did not love them. She felt that all love was very ordinary, and many people seemed both pitiful and laughable in her presence. Many people had altered their souls, emotions, words, and actions, some kind of fixed pattern, because of their love for her. Like a great wind, all kinds of grasses and trees swayed in this wind, and under the storm, no grass or tree could stand firm and still, without wavering at all. Her beauty was also like a great wind. But what she hoped for was a great tree that would never waver, standing proudly before her, not to be conquered by that bit of her beauty. She was looking for this kind of tree, but she had never found it.</p>
<p>She thought, "There won't be this kind of tree by the sea. If I need this kind of tree, I should look for it in the deep mountains."</p>
<p>Indeed, the souls of urban dwellers are all assimilated by an urban education and urban tastes. The souls of all women are cast from one</p>
<p>mold, and the souls of all men are cast from another mold. Individuality and uniqueness are not easy to exist. The leader's standard is produced in a commonly understood example. Everything seems vulgar and ordinary, and everything is transformed into a commodity form. Even human love, the concept before love, and the planning when in love are being turned over in the hands of merchants, all in the same pattern, without any surprises.</p>
<p>There is not a single slightly outstanding tree by the sea. Nor is there a single slightly outstanding person. Although many people fell for her, they all revealed foolishness and did the same things under the same circumstances. Those who were more sophisticated would first use some other reason to be together, and then lose their human form, turning into a dog. Those who were younger would only know how to write the kind of crude and clumsy letters, being humble and flattering in love, pretending. Seeing the foolishness of their own actions, they still could not move the woman. Not knowing how to improve their methods, they would make even more ridiculous expressions, either wanting to commit suicide or saying, "Please be careful," and so on. All love was either extremely foolish or extremely vulgar, so she saw these loves as worthless.</p>
<p>There was really not a single slightly lovable man.</p>
<p>She was tired of those men who had become formulas and the love that had become a formula. She suddenly thought of the pastor's son in the girl's words. She was attracted by a certain curiosity that came and went quickly, and she was a little surprised. She looked at the sky, and a shooting star was streaking across it, so she said to herself softly, "What has passed is over."</p>
<p>But that shooting star in her memory was still flashing with pleasing brilliance. "Only by being stronger can there be brilliance!" She smiled, because she felt that she was extremely strong. However, outside of her consciousness, there lurked a desire, this desire was hidden and the direction was vague.</p>
<p>In one of his novels, Zola mentioned a chaste woman who refused all the flattering and sincere young gentlemen who offered themselves to her.</p>
<p>士,逃到一個小鄕村後,却坦然儘一個粗鹵的農夫,在胃昧中吻了她的嘴唇同手足。驕傲的婦人厭 　輕視了一切柔情,却能在强暴中得到快感。</p>
<p>Zola, after fleeing to a small village, frankly allowed a crude farmer to kiss her lips and limbs in the dark. The proud woman hated and despised all tenderness, but could find pleasure in violence.</p>
<p>She remembered Zola's novel. What she could not understand in that work before, she now fully understood. If there were such a coincidental</p>
<p>encounter, she would, as the story said, "lie down on that golden stack of straw without any refusal." Solid heat, crazy love, the flame burned itself to death and also burned another to death. Only this kind of love is true love!</p>

<p>After a decline last Saturday, the gold market, although the silver market overseas in both England and the United States rose uniformly, the rise was weak. The exchange rate between England and the United States saw a rise of 0.375, while the exchange rate between England and the United States shrank by 0.0225. The price of goods did not fluctuate much. The forward silver price at the Metal Exchange was closed, and sentiment tended to be firm. In addition, it was reported the day before that U.S. Treasury Secretary Woodin had spoken about not relying on inflation, and yesterday it was reported that famous financial leaders on Wall Street claimed that President Roosevelt would discuss stabilizing the currency with the Governor of the Bank of England. It was also rumored that the U.S. monetary policy experiment was nearing its end, and sentiment was even better. The opening offer was immediately raised to 25 or 26 yuan. After the opening, it hovered initially, but after entering the market, due to the tight foreign exchange market, it rose all the way up, and the situation was quite firm. Later, the HSBC exchange rate was reduced, but the market rose again, and sentiment remained firm, with demand exceeding supply. The exchange rate once tightened slightly, and the gold price suddenly jumped to over 40 yuan, but there were quite a few sellers, and the banks' appetite tended to be blocked. Rumors arose, and the gold price gradually fell. It was found that the market situation was quite healthy for the day, but sentiment finally tended to be weak, giving a red price of 230 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 827 yuan, an increase of 7.7 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The price of goods opened at 7.2 yuan. The exchange rate opened with the near-term selling price calculated as British Exchange at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 9375, and U.S. Exchange at 28.8125 yuan. Although Swiss Exchange was sold from 7.3 yuan to 6 yuan, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yuansheng, Yonghengsheng, and Daju advanced. Citibank ate U.S. dollars for November at 1875, and it rose to 9 yuan. Dalian Gang’s goods, Da Fa, Yong, etc., then sold, and fell to 6.6 yuan. Hengxing, Zhaofeng, Changda, Decheng, Dachangxiang, Yuanxing, Yongyuan, Shengyongfu, Yu Daxing, Yongheng Yu, etc. successively purchased vigorously.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market tightened, and the banks paid for U.S. dollars for November at 1875, gradually tightening. Mitsui had paid for 9375 in the same month, and it rose to 35.6 yuan. The HSBC listing had already been revealed, with British at par, and U.S. only shrunk by 0.375, not suffering any impact. Hengyu, Ruixing, and Bingxing still sold at a high price. Citibank was willing to sell U.S. dollars for September at 625, but no one wanted it, and it fell to 2.5 yuan. The banks’ appetite was still healthy, and it was still stable at this time. Then, Yifeng, Yongzhengchang, Hengyu resold, and it fell to 1.2 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongyuanfeng, Yongrui Kangjin, etc. could still recover. Bingxing suddenly came and purchased vigorously. Sumitomo consecutively ate 29 yuan for November, 1875 for December, and it actually rebounded to 6 yuan. Datong paid 75 for October. Hengyu Zhaofengchang sold. Citibank sold U.S. dollars for November at 9375, and it fell to 3 yuan. Those who were seeking were still surging. The noon closing was 834.3 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 5 yuan. The after-market opening was 836 yuan, and the price of goods opened at 5.7 yuan. Ruikang Hengxing advanced to 7.8 yuan. Yuanmaoyong sold and still fell. After that, although HSBC listed British exchange as shrinking by 0.125 and U.S. exchange shrinking by 0.25, Hengyu Qingfa, Yongbingxing sold more.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, futures for August had stopped and were preparing to be settled on the 30th. Only futures for September were traded on the market for one month, so trading was naturally slightly inferior. However, the stagnant situation was also slightly reduced. Although there were no large transactions, retail investors were not lonely. At the morning opening, only 1.3 to 1.4 million transactions were made, and the market still felt weak and powerless. Various bonds continued to fall slightly by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the various bonds listed above still could not recover due to retail investors selling off, and were slightly weak by 0.05 or 0.1 yuan.

Disarmament recovered high by 0.55 yuan, and the rest also rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. 96 was also very strong, and the northern gang also had a need, so the market price resulted in a slight increase of 0.05 to 0.35 yuan.

<p>The yarn market tended to be weak. Because there was sufficient delivery for this month, and retail investors were mostly closing out, the market atmosphere became weaker and broke through the 80 yuan mark. In the last round, the Shenxin factory slightly purchased, but the price was still soft. The near month was loose, and the far month was dragged down by it. The last round was 177 yuan, discovering a new low price, 8.9 yuan smaller than last month.</p>

<p>At the Renbiao pre-market opening, this month was the last day, and many bulls temporarily closed out. The market atmosphere was not 　broken through the 80 yuan mark.

<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Although the overseas cotton market was flat, the exchange rate tended to shrink and the gold market rose. The calculation was still firm, and the weather was also bad, so sentiment was still good. In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and there were large holders selling short. The yarn market was sluggish, and the falling trend became stronger again, but some people resisted short selling on the dips.</p>

<p>Due to many holidays last week, the market situation was quiet. Although American cotton has been rising, this place has not been able to produce color because of good harvests and sluggish sales. In terms of spot goods, inquiries from China have increased, Europe is limited, and Japan is still resisting. Regarding the increase in import duties on foreign cotton, factories are quite panicked. Yarn and cloth transactions have stagnated, and factories are planning to adopt contraction policies. The harvest situation has made great progress due to the clear weather, and no damage has been found. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a consistent upward trend. Although the quotation for foreign wheat was only better by about 0.1 or 0.2 jiao, the sentiment in the market has gradually shifted. Although this month's delivery is imminent, however, the off-market, in the previous few days, due to the poor environment, consistently favored short selling. The factory’s chips were gradually resisted back. At this critical moment, there was a momentum that had to be resolved, so the situation turned tight. As for the long-term sentiment, due to off-market continuous losses, a feeling of injustice has not yet been dissipated. Taking advantage of the fact that the factory code is not increased, it is also raised step by step, so the market situation in each month is showing prosperity. As for the Tianjin gang, there are still few inquiries about spot goods, and futures were seen to retreat in the afternoon, and it seems that the trend has not reached its peak. As a result, this month rose by 0.325 fen compared to the previous week, September rose by 0.375 fen, October rose by 0.35 fen, November rose by 0.325 fen, and December and January each rose by 0.35 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Wheat is Carried Up by the Flour Market <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed a consistent firm and bullish trend. The quotation for foreign wheat recovered by about 0.1 or 0.2 jiao, which seemed to have little to do with the overall market atmosphere. Therefore, the sentiment at the opening price was still flat. Then, with the flour market rising, off-market bulls rose up again, causing the opening price to be good step by step. Until the afternoon, the market atmosphere generally revolved, and the ups and downs were very small compared to the morning. As for off-market observation, because foreign wheat is still difficult to directly order, and borrowing wheat has not yet arrived, no matter how the flour sales are, they will always buy short, and the trend is still very strong. As a result, September rose by 0.5 fen compared to the previous week, October rose by 0.6 fen, November rose by 0.4 fen, December rose by 0.9 fen, and January rose by 0.8 fen. The spot wheat market is still stable, but the handover is smooth. Kaihe wheat opened at 3.86 yuan, followed by 0.84 yuan. Gaoyou wheat was 3.67 yuan, followed by 0.64 yuan. Yangzhou wheat was 3.44 yuan. Wuxi wheat was 3.25 yuan. Yaowan wheat was 3.79 yuan, followed by 0.7 yuan. Hengqiao wheat was 3.57 yuan. Daqiao wheat was 3.61 yuan. Chuzhou wheat was 3.53 yuan. Fuxin went to 8,000 bags, and Xinda went to 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Weak Rice Still Shows Soft Signs <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly thirty shipments arrived. Both wholesale and retail sales were passable. However, due to the market's frequent fatigue, the overall trend remains weak. An estimated 1,500 to 1,600 packages were sold. Prices for regular-grade rice from Jiangsu, Tongxiang, South Port, as well as the Du Yang sharp-grain and Xin Chuan sharp-grain varieties, did not fluctuate significantly. Although there were more packages of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Si Jing, and Fengxian weak rice sold than before, prices dropped slightly due to wavering customer interest, hovering around the same price as regular silver dollars. The price of new early rice from Hebei remained stable. Dongchang's new glutinous rice maintained its original price.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, thirteen or fourteen shipments arrived from various areas of Hebei. Sales of various types of rice on the market were sluggish. The market price of North China glutinous rice was stable. Prices for early rice, Chen Du Yang sharp-grain, Xin Tuan ginseng sharp-grain, Xin Ke sharp-grain, and Dongchang new glutinous rice were similar to previous levels. The weakness of the weak rice caused a slight depreciation in silver dollars, decreasing by nearly an inch.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Newly Arrived Hunan Rice Sells Out Immediately <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a new batch of Hunan rice arrived, consisting of new rice from Jinggang. Being the first time it appeared on the market, it was welcomed by local customers. Fujian and Zhejiang merchants especially favored it, with Fujian merchants being particularly eager to purchase. Previously, the market inventory was low, preventing them from acquiring as much as they wanted. Upon the arrival of the new goods, they rushed to buy them. All 327 packages of Jinggang rice were purchased by Fuzhou merchants at prices ranging from six yuan, one jiao to six yuan, two jiao and a half. Compared to existing market prices and previous sales of old rice and machine-milled rice, it needed to be opened about two jiao. New machine-milled rice from Nanjing has been selling very well locally in recent days. Local merchants have also gone to Nanjing to purchase and package various types of machine-milled rice. Yesterday, local merchants also packaged 1,200 packages of new machine-milled rice, which were also purchased by merchants from Fuzhou and Quanzhou, maintaining a firm market position. Prices ranged from six yuan, six jiao and a half to six yuan, five jiao and two fen, similar to the initial selling prices from last week.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Decline in Foreign Rice Prices Triggers Sales <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Recently, new regular-grade rice from various regions and new sharp-grain rice from Hebei have been arriving in Shanghai successively, with harvest yields exceeding 80%. The arrival volume is expected to increase further, causing foreign merchants and hoarders to seek to sell their stocks of foreign rice. Yesterday, a British foreign firm directly sold 1,000 packages of high-quality small-grain rice to Ningbo merchants at a price one jiao lower than the previous day, at six yuan, seven jiao and a half. This price was intended for local consumption and sales. Future purchases may continue, but some local merchants still wish to hold out for slightly better prices. In general, both sides are gradually approaching a compromise, and the market is expected to become more active in the future.</p>

<p>Trading in new soybeans remains lively, with ample supply. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 packages were traded in the overall market, with sales matching arrivals. Market prices remained stable, and the arrival of old soybeans has decreased. Sales were primarily to factories. Yesterday, 78 cartloads of Yingzhou beans were sold at four yuan, seven jiao.</p>

Yesterday, only merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang purchased 18 boxes of Hongjinzhong, Shuanglong, and Tu Pisi brand current-term goods at prices ranging from 172 yuan, seven jiao and a half to 155 yuan and a half, net.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Overseas Silk Prices Gradually Trend Upward <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The success of the American recovery plan has led to discussions about inflation, causing stock market prices to soar. Raw silk prices have also increased accordingly. Unfortunately, factory purchases remain sluggish, making it difficult for silk sales in Shanghai to improve. European and American firms are occasionally active. Yesterday, Renji and others purchased 72 packages of white factory silk and 20 packages of yellow factory silk at higher prices.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Tea Market Shows Signs of Development <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's Tea Assistance Association has informed various tea merchants regarding various types of black tea from Qimen, Ningzhou, and the two Huguang provinces, as well as Gongxi green tea from Tunxi, Wuyuan, and other areas, that they must all provide new samples for brewing and testing in preparation for large-scale purchases. Major British trading firms involved in tea sales, such as Jinlong, Xiehe, and Yihang, are also taking a more active approach due to a reduction of 30,000 to 40,000 boxes in the production of Ping Shui Zhuang green tea this year, to compete for business. As a result, various types of green tea, including Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Gongxi, and Xiami, were more actively traded in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e258">Tung Oil Rises Slightly After Falling <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil soared in Hankou in July to 32 yuan per dan, foreign firms, due to the settlement of last month's futures contracts and the approaching settlement date for this month, coupled with weak spot market trading, the market was inevitably sluggish. Consequently, market prices gradually declined, eventually falling to just over 27 yuan last week. The reason for this sudden decline is that the number of futures contracts sold by various firms in August was not large, and the goods received, apart from those used to settle foreign firm contracts, still had surplus, and domestic consumption was not strong. The more it fell, the weaker it became. Recently, according to details from Hankou, foreign firms Yirui and Juxinglong purchased over 100 tons each at 26 yuan, seven jiao and five fen, with Yirui later purchasing another 100 tons at an average price of 27 yuan, according to foreign standards. From this perspective, the market has already bottomed out and is showing signs of a turnaround. Hankou firms are shipping in about 1,000 dans, priced at 21 yuan, seven jiao for customer orders, with wholesale prices at 21 yuan, five jiao. Only the lightest-colored oil is priced at 24 yuan. Currently, Hankou has over 60,000 dans in stock, most of which are intended to be sold at good prices, and are not willing to sell cheaply. Therefore, despite the large inventory, it is unlikely to affect the market. The price has already fallen to this point, and there is no risk of further decline. Local inventories in Shanghai are extremely low, and sales are good. Therefore, yesterday, various firms purchased 500 to 600 units of Zhejiang tung oil for 24 yuan, four or five jiao. It is reported that Hangzhou dealers also have little inventory, and that the producing areas along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have sold out. The scarcity of Zhejiang tung oil in the future is foreseeable. As the heat of autumn has not yet subsided, tung oil sales are likely to continue for longer, and the market situation will remain stable. A turnaround will depend on the volume of transactions by foreign firms in Hankou.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e259">Coarse Granulated White Sugar Continues to Rise <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose due to the exchange rate increasing to about two yuan, creating a tight situation. The association's market price for 24th-grade coarse granulated white sugar rose to two jiao and two fen after rising to 21 yuan, two jiao the day before. Yesterday, sellers suddenly demanded six jiao, while buyers offered five jiao, eventually trading at 21 yuan, five jiao and three fen. Re-export goods also rose to eight yuan, one jiao in Dutch currency (excluding taxes). 20th-grade medium granulated white sugar was priced at 21 yuan. Dutch PK brand was priced at 17 yuan, higher than the 17 yuan, one jiao offered by Gaoxiao Company. Taikoo sugar also rose by two jiao, with B grade at 21 yuan, nine jiao, CW grade at 21 yuan, seven jiao and a half, DY grade at 21 yuan, three jiao, and raw brown sugar rising to 18 yuan, one jiao. Local factory sugar rose by two jiao, Zhenji No. 1 refined sugar at 20 yuan, six jiao, Zhonghua Guohua refined sugar top grade at 20 yuan, seven jiao, No. 1 at five jiao, No. 2 at zai jiao, No. 3 at one jiao, No. 4 at 19 yuan, nine jiao, No. 1 ice sugar rose by two jiao to 24 yuan. Chaozhou merchants offered to sell several dozen packages of Qing goods for pickup at 15 yuan, nine jiao, up one jiao. In addition, there were only 20 bags of high-quality refined brown sugar available, rising by four jiao and a half to 17 yuan, eight jiao and a half. After Wufu white ice sugar rose to 18 yuan, it was reported that merchants requested a further increase of half a yuan to 18 yuan, five jiao, due to increased costs. According to general observations, the price of foreign sugar may continue to rise, perhaps because the exchange rate is expected to reach two yuan and three jiao.</p>

<p>Recently, due to weak sales in various regions, the price of golden needles has been declining, dropping by five or six jiao. In addition, inventories are increasing, and merchant prices are becoming more flexible. Yesterday, Daxing vegetable products were sold for 16 yuan, two or three jiao, followed by prices ranging from 16 yuan to 15 yuan, four or five jiao, with the market appearing flat.</p>

<p>Recent sheet lead transactions have shown no progress. Tea merchants, battery factories, and others have no business, and the market relies only on small purchases from ordnance factories, publishing houses, and other entities. Prices are declining due to the unfavorable environment. Currently, No. 2 is priced at 32 yuan, No. 3 and No. 4 at 31 yuan, five jiao, No. 5 at 30 yuan, five fen, No. 6 at 29 yuan, five jiao, No. 7 and No. 8 at 29 yuan, two jiao and a half, No. 9 and No. 10 at 30 yuan. It is reported that only twenty or thirty barrels of transactions have been made in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Galvanized Iron Roofs Not Selling Much <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Galvanized iron roofs are not selling much. The market is weak. Existing inventories are sufficient to supply the market for three months. As a result, prices are even lower than before by three or four jiao. However, the market is still slow, leaving those involved in the business feeling disappointed.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Local Factory Nails Selling Well to Merchants <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of local factory nails returned to six yuan, nine jiao (after reaching seven yuan, four jiao), merchant business has been booming. Several thousand barrels have been shipped to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and various areas along the Yangtze River in recent days. However, local business has not seen large transactions. It is reported that there have been deals involving over a thousand barrels with Xuzhou, Tianjin, and other regions. The market outlook is optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e264">"Prepared But Not Used" vs. "Used But Not Prepared" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>In today's society, there are many things that are "prepared but not used," and there are also many things that are "used but not prepared." This extreme, left-leaning and right-leaning, deformed morbidity can be used to test the true nature of contemporary society.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I read in a movie magazine the wise words of movie queen XX, who said that the only way for women to maintain their beauty is not to breastfeed their children after giving birth (actually, it would be better to use more of "her friends" and completely cut off childbirth). In fact, she is very right. How many modern women are willing to give birth? How many are willing to use their own milk to feed their children? The pair of breasts naturally given to women to feed children are simply covered in powder, sprinkled with perfume, and deeply wasted. During the day, they swagger on the street to show off to the opposite sex. Human evolution has reached this point, and women's breasts have indeed become useless things that are "prepared but not used."</p>
<p>In fact, there are also things that are "prepared but not used" among men. For example, some wealthy gentlemen who live in the city, enjoying the grace of foreign lords, bring cars to China for their use. Their two legs are like the two breasts of modern women. Throughout the year, even for three steps, they have to use cars for transportation. The two legs that were naturally made for walking have indeed become superfluous items that are "prepared but not used."</p>
<p>There are many more things like this: the "flower vases" in companies and foreign firms, the mansions and villas of wealthy old men in the city during the summer (because when summer arrives, everyone goes to Mogan Mountain and other places to escape the heat, and mansions and villas are heavily locked up). Aren't these all "prepared but not used"?</p>
<p>Speaking of big things, it is easy to remember that at the time of the Shenyang Incident, young marshal Zhang's two hundred or so planes were also "prepared but not used." Who knew that the Japanese thought it would be a pity to abandon them, so they borrowed them all and turned them to use in the Battle of Shanghai, bombing Zhabei into its current desolate state. Capitalist countries in Europe and the United States often have valuable agricultural products such as potatoes, wheat, and soybeans sunk into the sea, simply because they are "prepared but not used." Conversely, there are just as many phenomena of "used but not prepared."</p>
<p>How many modern women only look up dictionaries when they need to write love letters. Most female students secretly look at books and steal from others when they are about to take exams. Some even delegate secretaries to do the work for them. This is simply the result of "used but not prepared."</p>
<p>What about manly men and real men? In this day and age, many people are exploited to the point of poverty and cannot even get enough to eat. However, this "used but not prepared" has a very profound and valuable meaning to study, and it is not the fault of the parties involved.</p>
<p>Although our country is based on agriculture, there is often a fear of "used but not prepared" when it comes to food. Last year, we suffered a vast flood that affected sixteen provinces, so of course we had to borrow from the gold yuan countries. But even in a year as bountiful as last year, food was still the top import item at customs, and we still had to use cotton and wheat loans to make up for it. Now, the Yellow River has breached its dikes again, flooding without end. I really don't know how we will survive next year. Whether it is a year of famine or a year of abundance, the agricultural country has a fear of food shortages, which is simply "used but not prepared." The specialized talents needed in general agencies and government offices, as well as the scientific talents needed in industry, commerce, and agriculture, cannot be found in the country no matter how much you search with telescopes and microscopes. The only solution is to hire foreigners to act as proxies. Isn't this also "used but not prepared"?</p>
<p>"Prepared but not used" and "used but not prepared" exist in so many situations in China today. What is the reason? Please forgive me, I cannot say much more.</p>
<h3 id="e265">It Was At This Time <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>| It can also be considered one of my love stories |</p>
<p>It was at this time | Two years ago in early autumn, the gentle breeze was blowing, the light rain was drizzling, the weather was warm, life was warm, and I, finally, stepped from the starvation line into the circle of life.</p>
<p>When I moved into the small building of the X family, whom I had never met before, the reality revealed to me that it was not a human life. To put it nicely, it was like a machine to a factory owner. Because of this, I felt infinite mental distress, especially when I sat alone in the morning and evening, and especially at night, in the silent night. So I suffered from insomnia, and so I had the motivation to love.</p>
<p>Secondly, perhaps I was poisoned by "being full and warm makes you think of lust," and the heart when I had food to eat was different from being on the starvation line, which was undoubtedly the biggest reason for pushing the motivation.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better if there was some spiritual comfort!"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be possible to regulate a part of life if there were a few women to associate with, without being delusional!"</p>
<p>I thought, I called out, and this became my self-study course during my few spare hours each day.</p>
<p>One day, a burst of noise suddenly came from the building across the street, interspersed with one or two familiar hometown curses. Listening carefully, I realized that they were my fellow villagers. They had probably been abroad for many years, and their accents seemed to have some northern flavor, as well as some Shanghai dialect, but after careful listening, I could determine their origin | Completely correct, they were my fellow villagers.</p>
<p>The second floors faced each other, and the line of sight was blocked by the two doors between them. I could only hear voices, but I couldn't see anyone. So I climbed to the third floor to get to the bottom of it, and going up another floor, I reached the sunbathing platform. At this time, looking down from a height, I could see through all the people and things there. The most eye-catching was a very delicate young lady who was rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>After that, I often climbed onto the sunbathing platform, intentionally or unintentionally lingering there. She noticed this. At first, in her reported "hoping," there was a full "demonstration" of "there is a beautiful woman." I knew this was a common trick of women, and sure enough, after a long time, it was different. There were flirtatious eyes, flirtatious smiles, flirtatious greetings, and flirtatious feelings.</p>
<p>So I rashly wrote my first letter.</p>
<p>There was no response, so I sent a second and third letter······ I got a reply on the fourth letter: "I am already not a free person |" The first sentence of my reply was: "Is it true that unfree people cannot be free?" There was no reply again. I guessed that she had tacitly agreed with my words.</p>
<p>After that, the silent confrontation on the sunbathing platform was our way of communicating our feelings.</p>
<p>Not long after, she came to play at the X family, and even came up to my small building. I greeted her with great happiness and slight nervousness. She seemed a little surprised, and took a look at my simple furnishings. Then she stared at my bedding, and then was silent for a moment as if she was thinking. Suddenly she said: "Mr. X, I'm very sorry to bother you, goodbye!" This was considered her "attendance" to my boasting in the letter.</p>
<p>After she left, I felt infinite emptiness, infinite regret!</p>
<p>After that, I could only see her graceful figure from behind on the sunbathing platform.</p>
<p>It was at this time |</p>

<h3 id="e267">"Humor" and "Archaeology" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Human Nature</p>
<p>Literati and generals are different. "Warfare is based on deception." When generals are "locked in confrontation," they can not only use tricks like "appearing weak when strong, and causing vigilance when prepared" to win, but also "deceive with both weakness and strength." The more deceptive they are, the more honor they gain from victory. However, literati must openly discuss principles and doctrines with the public, so they must be truthful and not deceive. Deception cannot make the public truly believe. However, at certain times, not all truths can be told. Like these days, there are many truths that cannot be spoken. As the saying goes, "Disaster comes from the mouth." Now, if someone wants to honestly speak the truth arbitrarily, but they are unwilling to play deceptive tricks because they know deception does not make people truly believe, they devise a plan: to maintain the principle of not telling lies while avoiding danger. This is the origin of the current popularity of "humor" and "archaeology" in the Chinese cultural sphere.</p>
<p>Are there many people advocating the study of oracle bone script, Dunhuang literature, or writing "Critiques of Ancient History" and "Studies of Ancient Books"? Aren't there also many people diligently conceiving sarcastic and humorous remarks like "kick," "push," "pull," "crow," "let the women do it," etc.? This is because archaeology allows one to seriously understand historical phenomena, express some truths about events hundreds or thousands of years ago from one's own perspective without incurring unexpected danger, and also allows one to criticize Confucian corruption, Daoist elusiveness, Empress Dowager Cixi's absurdity, and Lin Qinnan's anti-meritocracy in addition to archaeology. As for telling humorous stories, although there is a component of truth and sometimes even hurts the sensibilities of great men and gentlemen, because it is close to joking and inconsequential, it won't cause any major disasters.</p>
<p>Naturally, in "archaeology" and "humor," literati and scholars inevitably feel lonely in the cultural world, so they take time to investigate matters of "plagiarism" and "stealing excerpts." Once they discover something, it becomes a big deal, requiring all parties to mobilize and engage in a great debate. However, generals sit aside and laugh, saying, "Literati are indeed very interesting!"</p>
<p>Clerk's Correspondence</p>
<p>A Moment of Pleasure,</p>
<p>Brings Eternal Calamity,</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have a question. My friend, Mr. Qiu, is just over twenty years old and works for a shipping company. Through a friend's introduction, he met a woman of twenty-nine, of average appearance. As they spent more time together, they fell in love, pledging to grow old together. Later, they frequented entertainment venues and engaged in intimate affairs. After careful investigation into her family situation, my friend discovered that she had a mother and three younger brothers to support. The family's expenses depended entirely on her, and her income mostly came from her boyfriend. Therefore, they had not formally become engaged, only exchanging a brief letter as a formality. Later, her mother became dissatisfied with my friend's small contributions, and my friend, angered, stopped seeing her. Several days later, she invited him over with a letter. My friend, suspecting nothing, went to her house. To his surprise, the family had hired thugs who tried to extort money. When they failed, they handed him over to the police. The woman accused him of rape, but the police, finding no evidence, refused to accept the case, advising them to settle it themselves. There was no further action until the other day when the woman came to propose reconciliation. My friend, fearing her malicious intentions and the potential for future trouble, ignored her. However, she constantly harasses him, and his career may be greatly affected. Feeling at a loss, he asked me to inquire of you. Considering the positions of both parties, they should bear equal guilt. But if resolved through the law, what specific liabilities would my friend face? I implore you to provide detailed guidance so that he can take appropriate action. In recent times, young people, unaware of the consequences, often pursue momentary pleasure, leading to eternal calamity. Your wise and cautionary words serve as a warning bell for society. I eagerly await your reply.</p>
<p>Zhu Ziming, Bell Tower</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Since your friend, Mr. Qiu, did not formally marry or become engaged to the woman, although there was an intimate affair, it can only be considered an act of fornication, without any legal relationship. Furthermore, the woman is already twenty-nine years old, exceeding the age of consent. And since it was consensual at the time, without any acts of violence or coercion, the charge of rape or attempted rape cannot be established. The only concern is whether there are seductive phrases in the so-called "brief letter." If so, your friend should bear the responsibility of seduction. If he can provide sufficient evidence to prove that it was consensual, or even that the woman initiated the seduction, then the charge of fornication cannot be established. However, if the woman is only eighteen, although she is over the age of consent, she has not reached adulthood, so in any case, your friend cannot escape the responsibility for disturbing the family. However, judging from the letter, the woman's mother seems to have the intention of profiting and indulging her daughter. It is best to collect evidence of this and preemptively file a lawsuit against them for scheming to extort money. Otherwise, he can only bear the pain and ask someone to mediate a settlement. Ignoring the matter will inevitably lead to ongoing harassment, affecting his career, and ultimately, running the risk of being convicted.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act One: Life and Death</p>
<p>Soldier Xin: Because they have money, and we don't.</p>
<p>Old Man: Yes, you soldiers have suffered enough, but now we are at war with foreigners, so there is no way around it. You don't know how much more we common people suffer than you do. You at least get a few steamed buns to eat every day, but we don't even have that.</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: Look at my leg, it's swollen like this.</p>
<p>Soldier Ding: Who isn't like this? Mine is even more swollen than yours. Look, there's blood coming out here.</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: It's infuriating. In the past, we only retreated after being defeated. But this time, fighting the foreigners is different. We only fired a few shots, didn't even make a single charge, and immediately ran. We ran so far, it's baffling.</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: You can't say that. Of course, we don't like fighting. It would be best if there was no such thing as war in the world. But what happened this time? We were very excited to hear that we were fighting foreigners. Everyone rushed to the front line full of murderous intent, but we hadn't even stood in the trenches for half a day before we were told to "retreat completely." If we were defeated, we didn't even see a single Japanese soldier.</p>
<p>Old Man: Isn't it said that the fighting at the front is fierce? Today, they brought back two truckloads of corpses and wounded soldiers from here.</p>
<p>Soldier Ding: Oh? I didn't know that.</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: So the two guys inside the temple, are they from today?</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: Is that so? Then I'll go ask them about the situation. (Enters the temple)</p>
<p>Old Man: If that's the case, if we retreat without even fighting, then what hope do we common people have? In a few days, all the soldiers at the front will have retreated, and we will become slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: Become slaves of a conquered nation? That's too easy for you. I'm afraid you'll all become cannon fodder before long.</p>
<p>Old Man: That's right! If we don't want to become slaves of a conquered nation, there's only one way: to escape. But we don't have money, so we can't escape. And where would we escape to? To be honest, it's better to prepare to become slaves of a conquered nation. Otherwise, we can only wait to die.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldier Jia: (Comes out of the temple slowly, supported by a soldier's shoulder) I was feeling extremely sad, so I came out to talk to everyone. (Sits on the tree)</p>
<p>Soldier Geng: Old man, where did you get hurt?</p>
<p>Wounded Soldier Jia: On this side of Gubeikou, about eighty li away from Gubeikou. It makes me so angry just thinking about it. Let me tell you: the Japanese soldiers suffered a major defeat once, and we killed more than five hundred of them in one night. They didn't dare to charge anymore, just waited for reinforcements. At night, they used many flashlights, shining them like ghost fires all over the mountains. Of course, that was just a show of strength. At the same time, they used large spotlights, shining them all night until dawn. Of course, that was because they were afraid of us raiding their camp. During the day, they fired heavy artillery. This went on for almost ten days. If our officers had issued a general attack order, we could definitely have retaken Gubeikou. But we just kept defending, kept defending, until the Japanese reinforcements arrived. Tanks, airplanes, and artillery attacked us from both sides, and we couldn't hold our second line of defense. A bomb destroyed more than half of it. My leg was also blown up.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Recent Film Industry in the Soviet Union (Part Two) <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Foreign Affairs Commissioner, Litvinov, is a peculiar genius from Asia. The current Soviet film industry is entirely under his support. Litvinov's foreign policy includes using films to assist his diplomatic skills. The themes of Soviet films are all rich in revolutionary background, which is the minimum requirement Litvinov has for films.</p>
<p>In the Soviet film industry, there is a famous playwright named Chai Xi. He is the most trusted person by Litvinov. He is the master of the film industry in the Soviet Union. Most of the themes of Soviet films are adopted by him. Although he has never directed a film, all Soviet films must be carefully considered by him. Litvinov's production plans are also entirely in his hands. He is indeed the central figure in the entire Soviet film industry.</p>
<p>The purpose of Soviet films is not to make a profit. All of their film production is subsidized by the government. Their purpose is to promote the Soviet revolution. Therefore, once a film is completed under the leadership of the government, it will not be subject to the difficulties of film censorship in other countries. Therefore, their film production work is very systematic and bold. The ticket prices for films shown in public are extremely low. Their films are for the masses and have an educational mission.</p>
<p>They firmly believe that the future world war will be a conflict between labor and capital. And they say that the increase in population is a geometric progression, while the increase in resources is an arithmetic progression, so the terrifying social problems of the future are about to descend. Most of the Soviet films seize this problem as the center, telling the masses and showing them the work they are currently using to select. Although this is feared by all imperialists, in the original sense of film education, the imperialists cannot help but recognize it.</p>
<p>Soviet films not only openly dissect issues such as labor and capital, but also powerfully announce their revolutionary work to other countries. Recently, Chai Xi wrote several films, all of which are narratives of revolutionary work scripts. Exposing the internal work of the Soviet Union on the screen, one of the film scripts that has been written is about the revolutionary war of independence and liberation that occurred in Turkey in 1918. This film was approved by the Turkish government. Turkey's struggle against imperialism during its independence and liberation is the main historical material adopted by Chai Xi. Turkey has a trend of mutual alliance with the Soviet Union, and the revolution in Turkey is certainly tacitly approved by the Soviet Union in psychology. The expansion of Soviet films to such an extent means that their future can be self-evident. (End)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e270">My View on "Mother and Son" <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>After watching "Mother and Son," I feel that this film is the most failed work since domestic films changed their direction in terms of consciousness. Undoubtedly, as the giant wheel of the times moves forward continuously, there should not be this kind of film with feudal ideas.</p>
<p>The first thing to know is that the theme of "Mother and Son" is ill-considered. Not only is there no such coincidental fact, but the playwright's basic idea is wrong (excerpt omitted). I believe that although prison is dark, it certainly does not have the ability to change a person's face so that even old acquaintances cannot recognize them. Lin Qingyun (played by Xuan Jinglin) was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. After being released from prison, she went to her former husband He Wenchao's house to work as a servant. He Wenchao was married to her for more than three years. How could a husband and wife who have been married for more than three years not recognize each other after eighteen years of prison life? Furthermore, when Qingyun killed Long'er, the black mole on Qingyun's forehead made Long'er recognize her as his mother. Yun'er, who was lost at the age of seven, was still able to recognize his mother because of a mole, so how could He Wenchao not recognize his ex-wife? And since the black mole is on the forehead, why can Yun'er see it but He Wenchao can't see it? This kind of negligence is really absurd!</p>
<h3 id="e271">Thoughts After Watching "Mother and Son" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>There are several points in "Mother and Son" that are worth discussing. 1) The main switch of the lights in the Shengping Bookstore should never be easily turned off. 2) China does not yet have "female police officers," but in this film, there are several female police officers guarding the service. 3) The description says that Qingyun stole Wenchao's pistol on the night Yun remembers he订婚， disguised himself, found Gongda, and shot him, but in the picture, Qingyun went to find Gongda and shot him, which was clearly the next day in the daytime. 4) Since pistols are dangerous items, they would never be thrown casually in a drawer. In short, "Mother and Son" is not of considerable value, it is just a mediocre script.</p>
<h3 id="e272">My Review of "Mother and Son" <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>After watching "Mother and Son," it was undoubtedly disappointing! The plot itself is very far-fetched and there are too many coincidences, but there are also some good shots and some places that need to be discussed. Now let's talk about it briefly.</p>
<p>Since Qingyun and Wenchao had a good relationship, after she was hijacked, she could not just feel sorry for her beloved son and want to influence Kong Lingwu and others, so she settled down in the bandit's den. At the very least, there should have been one or two attempts to escape with her son and then been discovered and captured back before she reluctantly stayed. This would give people a deeper understanding of her personality, knowing that she was not someone who "forgot about Wenchao" and "mingled with the bandits every day."</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, a coerced woman is not likely to receive an eighteen-year prison sentence. The clothing and hats of prison inmates should not all use Western numerals (Roman numerals). They should be changed to Chinese numerals or a combination of Chinese and Western numerals. When a gunshot occurs in a hotel, someone should come to investigate. In reality, no one would crawl into the room to check it out after so long. In addition, the servants' bedrooms in He Wenchao's house are too elaborate! Gongda was too calm after being injured, and no blood stains were seen on his shirt. These are all illogical. (Excerpt omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e273">My Review of "Mother and Son" <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Ding Ding</p>
<p>Regarding the performance in this film, I don't know how many mistakes there are. The biggest one is that Qingyun lost herself in the bandit's den because she had no choice. Afterward, she was discovered and arrested. If Qingyun could explain the reason—and of course, she could call Wenchao to testify—she would not have been sentenced to eighteen years in prison. But Qingyun didn't even think of this and obediently went to prison. I think: If Qingyun were a slightly rational woman, she would not be so stupid. Isn't this because she willingly went to prison? Of course, this plot is the most important key to the film. If Qingyun was released, the entire "Mother and Son" would completely disintegrate, so the playwright had to do this, and Qingyun was able to face trial. Therefore, the entire film "Mother and Son" was successfully completed! However, from the audience's point of view, how can this be justified?</p>
<h3 id="e274">The Trend of "Sexual Segregation" in Filmmaking <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Since the German film "Woman" recently set a new record in the film industry, the film industries of all countries have felt the possibility of making a film with all female actors. Therefore, Hollywood is not willing to lag behind and is planning to imitate films like "Woman" with all female actors. Therefore, the so-called ideal of Sexual Segregation has now become the most fashionable problem in the film industry. Most people in Hollywood think that sexual segregation is a way to change the monotonous filmmaking method and change the taste. They all think that the filmmaking method of sexual segregation is very interesting and will at least not completely fail.</p>
<p>Hollywood has already started filming sexual segregation films. Paramount's new film "50 Million Women" is a film with all female actors. There are fifteen main actors in it. Sweetheart Nanette Carroll, the fleshy and attractive Carole Lombard, and Alison Skipworth are among them. At the same time, there is a film called "Gold Divers," which is a film with all male actors. It tells the story of a ship encountering danger at sea and the rescue of passengers. The Paramount authorities are still recruiting actors, and there are probably a dozen well-known male stars who will play the leading roles. There will be hundreds of men in the ensemble.</p>
<p>Paramount is the leader in sexual segregation. Since the filming of "50 Million Women," Hollywood has become extremely interested in the filmmaking of sexual segregation. Fox and MGM also plan to film sexual segregation films. Warner First National United Artists are also planning to take sexual segregation films. Universal is actively preparing. The films of sexual segregation suddenly became fashionable.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Soviet National Film Academy <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— An Ding</p>
<p>In order to create film professionals and develop emerging film industry, the Soviet government specially founded the world's largest film art training institute——"National Film Academy." The college has a perfect equipment, a large-scale experimental photography field, factory, and a library with hundreds of thousands of books. Contributed to students experiment or reference. The entire course is divided into more than ten specialties: director, performance, photography, setting, sound, sound, chemistry, mechanics, makeup, electricity, and so on. The teachers who teach are all well-known specialists in the Soviet Union. Among the thousands of students in the whole school, there are thirty-three different nationalities, including several Orientals (Chinese, Korean) being educated.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for mass production (films), the Soviet Union has also opened several factories for manufacturing film, as well as sound and silent machines. I heard that the results of the products are extremely perfect, even above the products of European and American countries.</p>
<p>Soviet film art, like other Soviet undertakings, has made progress that is enough to amaze all mankind on earth. Looking back at my country's film industry, which is still dark and in a state of disarray (although a small part is advancing), I feel ashamed. I hope that my country's film industry can use the emerging film art of the Soviet Union as a reference, cheer up and work hard.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Joan Blondell's Advice <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Joan Blondell is the number one red star in Hollywood, but this time she unconsciously believes that her film screen career is not the best profession. The people of Hollywood find this very strange.</p>
<p>Joan Blondell recently went to Washington for sightseeing. After arriving in Washington, she visited various universities. When she was at the University of Washington, the students asked her to give a speech. She said that school is the most beautiful paradise, and I hope that you will work harder on your books. Many students now consider everything in Hollywood to be more interesting than books, but this is the worst thing. I hope you don't do this, and forget about everything in Hollywood, because entertainment is not as necessary as learning every day. As for my life in the arts, it only provides entertainment at most. If we talk about film education theory, we can only get "some benefits" during the leisure time. Joan Blondell's words are very thorough. She gave the same meaning to the students of Jefren University in Washington, so the people of Hollywood found her very strange.</p>

<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>That evening, because of Serbia's independence, Du Sheng held a celebration at home. When the guests filled the hall, everyone felt that Du Sheng was no longer the amiable and approachable person he used to be. He was stern-faced and preoccupied. He pieced together the suspicions he had harbored during the day with all the casual signs of the past, feeling that even the slightest clues could confirm Qi Sa's crime with Ai Lina. In the middle of the banquet, the new military judge, Bang Tuo, arrived. He came to obtain an officer's signature on a search warrant to search the residences of several national enemies, and Qi Sa's name was also prominently on that list of national enemies. The guests discussed among themselves, saying that it was easy for searchers to frame someone, and that military execution was a very convenient method of disposal. Du Sheng coldly watched Ai Lina's facial expressions change from the side. He pretended to be indifferent, quietly waiting for Ai Lina to become unbearable and beg him to warn Qi Sa. He coldly waited for the facts to prove his wife's adultery, thinking that it was impossible to escape. Ai Lina was also afraid that she would be too anxious and reveal her flaws, so she also paid close attention to Du Sheng's attitude. Finally, Du Sheng ordered the carriage to be prepared, but suddenly his jealousy burned up, and he delayed going. Ai Lina was, after all, a woman, and she could no longer bear it. Suddenly, disregarding everything, she frantically begged Du Sheng to rescue Qi Sa. Du Sheng's rage immediately erupted uncontrollably, and he vowed not to care. He said that even if they were to hang Qi Sa, he would not lift a finger to save him. He also sent the carriage away.</p>
<p>Ai Lina said nothing, her face turned pale, she struggled free from her husband's grasp, and ran straight out. She ran across the vast fields towards Qi Sa's residence. But before Ai Lina could say a few words to Qi Sa, Du Sheng had already arrived. He cursed Qi Sa like a vicious god, saying that he was a beast in human form, a beast in clothing. He kept asking, "When did this happen? When did you get her?" Qi Sa calmly shouted, "God save me, this is completely untrue." Ai Lina also defended, "No, Du Sheng, this is not true." Du Sheng snorted and said, "No? Oh, I understand."</p>
<p>"It hasn't happened yet. Just kissing. Fumbling around, behind my back. Not enough yet. Still need to go further." Ai Lina suddenly shouted, "Don't say any more." Du Sheng said, "Those are all lies." Du Sheng said, "Lies? Don't you have anything going on? Haven't you even kissed? Look at me, answer me!" Ai Lina couldn't answer him. Du Sheng grabbed her and shook her, but she didn't say a word. Du Sheng lost his self-control, and the two men wrestled and fought, each using all their strength to kill the other (To be continued)</p>
