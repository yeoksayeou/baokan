<p>— 實</p>
<p>蘇聯外交人民委員長李維洛夫。經德法渡大西洋。赴華盛頓與美國總統羅斯福晤面。商談美蘇兩國恢復國交問題。十六年來殭化之美蘇國交。或可從此打開。非特歐洲政局。將因此發生新變化。即太平洋亦恐不免有所影響也。就目前世界經濟情勢論。資本主義國家欲勉爲維持現狀。惟有希望有一新市塲。以供其現有生産貨品消納之所。以故皆注目於我國之市塲。無如我國自九一八事變以還。迭遭外來之壓迫。致我整個經濟已陷於不可收拾之境域。其餘各地。皆已劃定範圍。不易超越。而又無斷然爲軍事冒險之决心。欲圖以和平方法爭取市場。殊難有望。不得已而思其次。惟有轉其車輪以向社會主義國家所提供之市塲求出路。</p>
<p>美國以是抛棄其歷來之傳統見解。丢開美俄間以往之債務。先從事於尋常國交之恢復。而復交過程中。即商談定購貨品問題。美國且有人希冀巨額之信用定貨。以活動美國之市塲。蓋美國現在因實施復興法案所激起之一時的興奮。工廠製造之貨品。並未直接入於消費者之手。爲投機商人所操縱。而依然滯積於倉庫之中。九月之後。市面又復轉向下。設使無擴張軍需工業之影響。與通貨膨脹政策之刺激則今日經濟情形。恐不免更見頽廢。故急急以謀蘇美之復交。倘蘇美之間。經濟關係。能轉入正常狀態。則不平衡的經濟現勢。丨丨將轉而得到暫時之安定。亦未可知。</p>
<p>不特此也。日本之武力政策。進行不已。北向威脅西比利亞。至少有强取鄂霍次克海一帶之漁業權及庫頁島石油礦之勢。南向則有制霸西太平洋之雄心。以挾制英美獨步亞東。此種形勢。美國以劣勢海軍。萬難予以裁制。不得已乃在政治上引蘇聯爲聲援。以遏止日本軍國主義之進展。在西歐低氣壓之雰圍中。在太平洋上戰雲密佈下。美蘇復交之電信傳來。和平乃現一線之光明。第二次世界大戰。一時似有暫緩之趨勢。</p>
<p>雖然。和平果可恃乎。二次世界大戰眞能避免乎。審時度勢。吾知其必不然也。一則日美關係。並不因美國將太平洋艦隊撤至大西洋上訓練。而即稍見緩和。至於日蘇之間以北滿之爭霸。直接衝突。終不能免。中東路買賣問題。不過若干問題中之一端。即使此問題能解决。而其他問題依然存在。吾人試觀蘇聯人民委員會主席莫洛托夫之言。即可窺知日蘇間實含有不可避免之衝突性在焉。</p>
<p>夫蘇聯政府當局。對外素常愼重。决不肯輕於發言。試觀兩年來之緘默。即可爲證。頃者十月革命第十六週紀念日。蘇聯政治當局之莫洛托夫。竟謂「……現時對於吾人軍事攻擊的危險。已特别嚴重。所以我們對帝國主義破壞和平的計劃。須充分注意。……」其於日本之在東三省也。則直接指出「日本爲僞滿洲國的實際主人。其責任亦應由日本担負……」。同時更指責日本盲目冒險之可笑。更直斥其强奪計劃爲無恥。此類露骨的申說。非特日間擊堪。即日蘇尋常外交關係上。亦覺難受。且在此美蘇復交將演成事實之時。而發　激硬之論。日本能澈底覺悟否耶。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　前印度事務部大臣丕爾勳爵今日在上議院辯論英國在華政策時、稱讚中國固有之商業上試實、及中國人民雖處逆境、猶勉力經營商業之方式、繼謂英國固宜開闢對俄貿易、但尤應注重中國商塲因中國人民較庶而中國在貿易問閉中之容易答應亦較大也、英國對華政策、無時不關重要、而以今日爲尤甚、其故以世界情形變遷、而英國貿易困難也、</p>
<p>改造對華態度　不知政府鑒此新環境、亦曾注意於對華態度之改造乎、現政府之對華政策、有聽令時事浮沉之過分傾向、如華人以爲吾人僅持觀望態度則吾人不能希望得華人之尊重　他國不稍鬆懈、無時不急於鞏固其在華地位焉云、</p>
<p>不主金融助華　丕爾勳爵繼言南京政府與宋子文之成功、謂宋　已辭戰、但渠覺宋不久必再出、英國之認識中國、較西方任何國爲久、證諸歷史、英國未有侵略的或領土的野心英國之印度政策、已證明英國不欲在華獲有任何支配利益、英國可以憲兵襄助中國、使可逐漸恢復長江流域之秩序、蓋長江秩序不復、則南京政府之計劃將無一可獲結果也、渠不主張以金　襄助給予中國云、</p>
<p>英使駐節問題　丕爾勳爵後言及駐華英　駐節問題、謂渠雖不建議英使應駐上海、但渠覺許多困難之發生、由於英使與上海僑民間未有充分之接觸、至於改派大使問題、渠覺英國且派大使駐於關係重要遠東若中國之國矣云、</p>
<p>維持駐滬軍隊　丕爾勳爵最後言及上海問題、引證費唐報告書、尤其是關於法官獨立之一節、謂此乃國際問題、須得列强之合作、又謂駐滬英軍之撤　、適與上海日軍大營壘之建築同時發生、渠意目前時機、最宜於對華策之重新規定云、</p>
<p>贊助丕爾主張　帝國化學業公司董事悔爾轍特勳爵贊助丕爾勳爵之言論、並言及化學業公司主任麥克戈安遊歷中國事希望英國其他實業家亦照此辦理、魯迦德與艾丁頓兩勳爵相繼發言、艾丁頓係一九二三年至二八年在華敵産保管員、渠主張使署不設在北平、並對於駐滬英軍之撤减、表示遺憾、</p>
<p>史丹賀浦發言　史丹賀浦勳爵發言、謂孫中山曾邀渠參加中國某次之革命、又謂就中國貿易而言、渠歡迎麥克戈安遊歷中國之行動、英政府對華抱誠摯友好之政策、英國目的、在對於有組織的政府維持良好關係、英國願以極大之範圍迎合中國人民之國家願望、並認識全國有力的之國家情感、</p>

<p>政府認爲非宜　（倫敦）　政府代表昨在上院答丕爾勳爵之詞、已表示北平英使署移往南京、英政府認爲不宜、但英使駐滬或駐寗之問題、將不因此而終止、康特堡立主敎今日函致泰晤士報、謂以中國人民之合作、英人可多所成就、如稅關與郵局之設立、及辛博森在長江流域之浚河事業、皆其證也、但南京英人是否如美人之感動華人、殊可疑問、如英使自已駐於南京、而不與行政地點相隔六百哩、則事態或異是、英使離北平而往南京、誠舍最美麗之城而就正在建設中之新都、但英使此舉至少可爲英倫盡職、許多與中國有關係者久勸政府在寗或在滬設英使駐節之處、他國駐華公使有費其大半時間於上海者、英國可效法也云、衆意不久國會將再提議此事（九日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c273">一蟹不如一蟹 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>這幾天洋澄湖清水蟹上市了。或者受着五柳先生的　，持鰲對菊，引爲雅事，無論農工商學兵，要是身邊有餘錢的，都得買一個來嘗嘗，也算應了時。「九月團臍十月尖」，一天好一天了。我覺得五柳先生的後裔榖先生，在吳越忠懿王席上，所感到的「一蟹不如一蟹」，不過是當時偶然的棖觸，實際上遇得說是一蟹勝似一蟹。因爲從春末夏初一直過來，蟹的生長逐漸進步，西風一起，更見充實，九月裏的蟹一定比八月裏的好；十月裏的尖，比九月裏的團臍還要好。直到明年，桃花水漲，蟹朋友仍到水底去追求異性，經營生殖，那纔不見蹤跡。所以我們只感到天天喫蟹，愈喫愈好。</p>
<p>不知怎樣，這一句古幽默話，給人聽了去，便假借了比喻人事的「每况愈下」。並且認爲人們的精神文明，尤其和這句話相合，我們去聽那些悲觀論者，對於現代的一切，除掉物質文明以外，那一件不在那裏嘅嘆着「一蟹不如一蟹」。那麽蟹的實際和蟹的象徴，不是立於相對地位了麽。</p>
<p>不過在農村，却是感到了這句話的夠味了。他們捉蟹是狼便當的，到了晚上，提着燈，拿着畚箕，到湖邊去，一個黄昏，總得捉幾個來的。爲了這幾年米價的銳落，農村經濟的崩潰，他們捉得了蟹，也不捨得自己嘗新，要上市去換錢了。還有那些張　捉蟹的，也說，現在賣每兩一百多錢的蟹，反不及十多年前每兩只賣十文錢的蟹來得實惠。因爲他們生活所需、還不止十倍的遞增。那麽社會整個的形成了「一蟹不如一蟹」了。</p>
<h3 id="c274">略談女性名稱的種種 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 彭翔</p>
<p>不談政治，不談風月：談談女性的名稱，不亦佳乎！</p>
<p>▲密斯　歐風東漸，這「密斯」的稱呼幾乎有取「小姐」的位置而代之之槪。當然，這「密斯」祗流行在「文明」的地段裏，如大學校，「高等社會層」中；而大家的閨秀則仍名以「小姐」，示莊重也。記得去年上海報紙上曾載過北平某女校禁止學生互稱「密斯」而呌「小姐」的消息，理由似乎是在保存國粹。但於我看來，覺得也未免多事。</p>
<p>▲花瓶　這「花瓶」也是新興的女性名稱之一。望文生義，大家當看得出這並不是一個含有好意的名稱，祇是男性在背後私起的帶有諷刺性的别名而已。試據這「花瓶」的來源，當追溯到前幾年女子在上海的社會職業中佔了一角地位的那個時候。當時機關裏，公司裏一時風氣，大家競雇了一批女性；而這些小姐，似乎太愛打扮了一點，不免引起了社會上一般人士的注目；於是此「花瓶」之名也應時而起了。但流行的地域並不廣，似乎祗限於上海一地。</p>
<p>▲雌兒　這古怪的名稱，見水滸傳西門慶語：「乾娘，你且來，我問你：間壁這個雌兒，是誰的老小？」顯然這也不是一個好字眼，實含有一點輕藐侮辱的意思，祗有西門大官人才敢說得出。因爲人祇能分男女，而不能分雌雄：雌雄僅能應用在下等動物的身上。可慶幸的：這「雌兒」我還没有聽人呌過：大槪我是住在「中等社會」裏的緣故吧。在内地的「下等社會」中仍舊流行着也是說不出的。但這祗好有待於語言學者的調查，這裏暫不詳談。</p>
<p>名書家許鐵豐墨蹟</p>
<p>書家許鐵豐到滬鬻字以來，生涯鼎盛、蓋許君工力精純，下筆皆精心着意，絲毫不苟，更無絲毫習氣。茲因舊寓不敷展布，刻已遷居霞飛路四明里五號新居，同時並聯合海内文豪以及書畫名家，設一尙友文藝金石書畫合作社，專事提倡風雅，爲社會服務，平津滬三方加入者甚多。</p>
<p>▲寡老　這是「游民」階級稱呼女性的一個暗語。在「下層社會」中佔有相當的勢力，而在「中上社會層」中休想揷足也是理所當然的事。但此「寡老」二字從何得來，我不能確切知道，也没有機會去問一問「此輩中人」。不過照我最荒唐的猜想說來；這「寡老」似乎與“Ｇirl”的譯音相似。說到這裏，我想起近來曾有人把他譯作「狗兒」。雖是譯音，但以「狗兒」直呼女性，則男性亦不當爲「雄狗」乎？這恰和西門大官人犯了同一毛病。</p>
<p>話越說越遠，就此「帶住」吧。</p>

<p>予之識一冲，由於半狂盟兄之介，先是五弟轉陶，與一冲書翰往還，神交已久，而予則方碌碌奔波，雖間其名，絕未一通音問也。甲子年，齊盧逞兵，三吳故鄕，十室九遷，避地於海上。盟兄半狂，挈眷來滬，轉陶亦奉親而至，予正客歇浦之西，習行賈之衛，相見甚歡。半狂賃居滬西，予與轉陶，侍親宿於逆旅，半狂間日必至，相聚一室，而海上諸友，紛然來訪，一冲亦即識於旅邸之間。是時一冲，方任職銀行，與之語，豪俠邁爽，不類闤　中人。蓋一冲雖日較錙銖，性則任俠，有求無不應，喜結交，視黄金如糞土，能飲善言，與之交，無不歡然。十月冬，蠻觸興闌，家鄕平安，半狂轉陶，相約賦歸，予又以俗務爲累，遂不復見一冲。越歲，予又以故鄕風鶴頻驚，歸里侍親，與一冲違者二載，轉陶則有事於海上，與一冲已朝夕過從矣。民十六，半狂應畢將軍之聘，權掌秘幕，偕予同赴，過海上，一冲來晤，復宴半狂及予，其豪邁之氣，依然當年，飲酒如長鯨吸百川，大氣磅　，無與倫比。畢將軍被害，半狂偕予重來海上，而一冲以經紀敗，爲其舅所斥，然其性氣，不以此而稍衰，達觀一如往昔。其後一冲，落落無所合，光景益困，其舅氏則方豪富一時，絕不一顧，雖經諸友陳請，漠然如陌路。予亦塊無餘蓄，不能援故人之急，迄今依然内疚也。一二八之没，一冲又適當其衝，家室蕩然，然一冲亦未以爲傷，祗以人情薄勝秋雲。常憮然若失，前日，友人來告，一冲竟赴修文之召，聞之與半狂相對潛然，不知淚之濕衣裙者矣。回憶疇昔。其高邁豪爽，仍在目前，孰知其中壽未屆，已歸天上，悲夫！</p>

<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿忽忽出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>趙自强心裏想着，若是和父親說出實話，從此就不回來了，也許不等自己走，父親就要流出淚來的了。於是挺着胸脯，硬硬朗朗的呌了一聲道；爸爸，我走了，下午我再回來罷。說着，脚後跟撲通打了一下響，然後舉起手來，向父親行了一個舉手的軍禮，突然的一轉身猶如在操場上，開着正當的步子走路一樣，一提脚步，撲突撲突，就這樣的走了出去了。當他走的時候，一直向前，並没有看别的所在，及到一口氣走出了海甸街，道才回轉身來，呆呆的站定，向海甸街，這一排屋脊，望了出神，同時，却垂了頭，長長的歎上一口氣。就在這時，只見眼前的大道頂端，塵頭大起，帶來的司務長和幾名弟兄，趕着拖大車的幾頭牲口，飛也似的跑着，那大車輪子，在人行大道上滾着，空隆隆了作響，跑到面前來，司務長原是在車上坐着的，老遠的就由車上跳了下來，舉着手道：連長一個人倒先走了。趙自强聽說，心裏頭不由得暗暗的呌了兩聲慚愧。心想，我眞是心不在焉了，怎麽把他們丢開，我一個就先走了，我到海甸，究竟是爲了幹什麽來的？於是笑道：我知道你們會趕了來的，我在這裏等着你們呢。他們固然是笑嘻嘻的在這裏說話，每個大車上跟來的一名夫子，各人手上拿了一條細長的鞭子，都把鞭梢子，拖到地面上來。每人的臉上，也都帶了一種死灰色，尤其是最前面的一人，車夫，他上身穿了一件舊藍布短褂，上面有好幾枚補釘·頭上偏戴着是一頂醬色的氈帽，帽沿像他爲人那樣柔懦，四週紛披着下來，半遮了他的臉。（二三六）</p>

<p>他覺得也許是他穿着西裝引起他們的注意了，他覺得以前出來是常和他地主的兒子一起的。</p>
<p>慢慢地跑回去。走到門口，他看見他表哥和兩個孩子爭吵着：</p>
<p>「你們老頭兒爲什麽不來？」</p>
<p>「生病了。」</p>
<p>「那麽你們爲什麽來得這麽遲呢？」</p>
<p>「先生：跑不快呀！」</p>
<p>「跑不快又要送什麽報呢？」</p>
<p>「没有人送呀！」</p>
<p>從金福嘴裏他知道了這兩個孩子是送報人的兒子，幷且因爲今天遲了一點，所以在呵責他。平自然不大　成他表哥的舉動，不過不敢說吧了。</p>
<p>又是一天的早晨。平在門口伺候着送報人　等了一忽，來了，遠遠地負着一個報袋的孩子走過來了，祗是一個孩子，一個年紀比較大一些的孩子。平拉着他的衣襟：</p>
<p>「還有一個小孩子呢？」</p>
<p>「他走不動，不來了。」</p>
<p>「送報的是不是你的爸爸？昨天來的小孩是不是你的弟弟？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>他沉默了，好似發現了什麽似的驚異着。送報的孩子走進屋裏送掉了報又走了出來，正向原路走去，不預防地被平一把拖住了一條</p>
<p>「慢，你是回去嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的」</p>
<p>「我問你：你家裏有多少人？」</p>
<p>「連我有八個，一個爸；一個媽，一個姊姊還有四個弟弟………………」</p>
<p>「……………………………………」</p>
<p>他瘋狂般地直立着：他想起了一切，他想起電影裏所說的勞苦羣衆大槪就是他們了，他好似覺悟了似的，他又想到地主的舅舅和表哥，他覺得可惡，覺得完全是明顯地兩個世界丨丨貧富不均的兩個世界………他一副很有表情的臉孔望着天，另一隻手高舉起來，忽然又握住了自己的頭髮。這一種動作使送報的孩子驚呆了：</p>
<p>「先生：我要走了！」孩子的呼聲，給他發現了他自己不緊握住他的一條胳膊，他笑了。</p>
<p>「到你家裏有多少路？」</p>
<p>「十幾里，不到廿里。」</p>
<p>「我們一起走」</p>
<p>「你走不動的！」</p>
<p>「笑話！你比我年小爲什麽我走不動？你怎麽知道我走不動？」他偷偷地恐怕被他舅舅家裏的人發現他，會阻止他。</p>
<p>平想嘗一下勞苦的滋味，决意地開始和小報販一起走。走出了村子又走上了稻出，荒塚，野墓，祇有荆棘的粗糙的狹路，並没有柏油馬路一般地康莊大道，這是平有生以來第一次的嘗試。烈火般的太陽迫射上他的頭背，…………漸漸地熱鬧起來，茶館，肉店，燈草行，還有肩上挑了柴的婦人目不轉睛地向他瞧，平想歇一歇·他們踏進了一家小茶館吃茶又吃點心，平看見他很好吃地嚼着，好似没有吃過早餐模樣，平又默想他不是每天有如此吃的，他發現了世界中不完全是有衣穿有飯吃有書讀的孩子。</p>
<p>兩人又開始大踏步向前走出，走去，走完他們的路，走到他們目的地。平雖然累了，身上又被汗侵透了，但是他臉上露出快慰地的笑意好似勝利着。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c278">光榮的下塲 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>在這不景氣的年頭，小市民們追求刺激之道似乎也窮盡了，看報紙上當做了不得的新聞就可知道；江民聲擦皮鞋呀，梁桐芳拉車呀，「抗日英雄如此下塲」，這些事情也成了談話的好題材了！然而我不解。</p>
<p>記得有人論易卜生名劇傀儡家庭的主人公娜拉的出走道：「一個娜拉的出走，或者也許不至於感到困難的，因爲這人物很特别，舉動也新鮮，能得到若干人們的同情，幫助着生活，生活在人們的同情之下，已經是不自由了，然而倘有一百個娜拉出走，便連同情也减少，有一千一萬個出走、就得到厭惡了」。誰都　道，這是實情，幷且有古語作證：「物以希爲貴」。</p>
<p>但江民聲少將們的境遇，並不能與娜拉相提並論。第一，退伍將士而操賤業（？）的，原就不算「特别」，不算「新鮮」。第二，這樣的人物，爲數定不勝枚舉，不像娜拉那樣，當時實只有她一個。然則，上海的新聞記者先生們爲什麽把並不希罕的人事抬舉起來呢？</p>
<p>也許，這裏面寓着一種憤慨。同是抗日英雄，日暮途窮的如此，而飛黄騰達的如彼，特别提出來給對照一下罷？但這樣的事情，也何足爲奇！周穆王南征，一軍盡化，君子爲猿鶴，小人爲虫沙，自古已然，而將官的藉枯骨成名，闊人的靠凶器牟利，不是於今爲烈麽！在萬事不平的社會中，這一種不平稱得什麽？小市民們的意見，難道以爲所有的抗日英雄，都該升官發財麽？</p>
<p>我並不主張「堂堂好男子，是好沙場死」。（黄遵憲軍歌），但「英雄」而旣願「抗日」，則爲國犧牲，當然是在預期中的。幸而抗日成功，得逃一死，則退伍而覓一職業，不管是擦皮鞋或拉車，正當地謀生，實在是光明磊落的「好男子」之所爲。這算什麽「日暮途窮」？幹嗎要别人的同情？倘若江民聲，梁桐芳兩君的擦皮鞋和拉車，實係甘願：並非出於矮情，故作招搖，則一班小市民的驚奇，將被他們笑爲「庸人自擾」了。</p>
<p>在今日，江民聲梁桐芳兩君，也許已經有「同情」的人在幫助生活了罷，但兩君倘若甘心接受他們的幫助，那就上了當，而且會失了他們原有的價値。一個兩個江民聲，使人發生興味，十個以上的江民聲，就會使人討厭的。小市民們何嘗眞有同情，他們不過是在看戲，找「特别」「新鮮」的刺激罷了。</p>

<p>「我們要尋快活啊！」在後半節，這，常常從她丈夫的口裏迸出來，于是乎每一有錢，家裏便大吃一頓，吃到半文錢不剩，再不計較冬天要餓肚子，餓得那麽的慘！</p>
<p>在那年高喊大兵不拉伕的當兒，她的丈夫大約是給「請」去了！一「請」十年，總也不見他回來。</p>
<p>而福壽嫂也只好上闊親戚家裏做寄娘了！</p>
<p>福壽嫂也有過兒子，三四個，爲了貧窮，爲了疾病，都死了！所幸，總算給她留下最後的一根苗，今年，這最後的一根苗、十六歲了，再給他娶房媳婦，便完了我們福壽嫂的一椿心事！也就是福壽嫂做寄娘的目的。</p>
<p>所以她雖然丢了丈夫，死了兒子，經過了千辛萬苦，以後還是吃苦，但是，並不灰心。</p>
<p>這樣，在闊親戚家裏不覺已是十年了，人，老了！做事有點糊塗起來，闊親戚可不愛這麽糊塗的老傢伙！</p>
<p>出來。捲舖蓋回到鄕下去！</p>
<p>她並不怨恨，我可以保證她上了吊以後也還不會怨恨，她想：有錢爲什麽白花在無用的人的身上？她還爲了以前的糊塗抱着歉哩！</p>
<p>到了鄕下，本來麽，兒子也可以每天桃菜去城裏換錢了，不必再要她勞神，但是，她有一椿心事呀！兒子還没有討老婆。</p>
<p>她是會織布的，于是她睜起老花了的眼睛天天織起布來，雖然織布的收入是敵不過做寄娘。但是她耐着，耐着，苦？不在乎！甜哩！那後味。</p>
<p>甜哩！那後味。</p>
<p>就是今天，村裏的人抬一張竹床進到福壽嫂家裏來了。</p>
<p>「什麽？」她正幻想着兒子娶親啦，「嫁妝？」</p>
<p>「呀！」福壽嫂滾在地下半晌才回過聲來。</p>
<p>「誰打的？誰打的？……鼻…息…都……没有了！」</p>
<p>「土匪嗎？」</p>
<p>「呀！我的兒呀！」</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>在夜深，福壽嫂去圖地下的歡聚了！</p>
<h3 id="c280">鬥牛 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>獨自個兒的時候丨猶共在這樣靜寂的夜裏，最愛冥想：或是回味點已逝的陳蹟。我凝神着那個伏在叢林上的金黄月，悠然地想起鬥牛來：</p>
<p>在童年時，特别愛瞧鬥牛，這是我們故鄕一帶地方農村娛樂之一。富裕點的人家大都養有鬥牛。一到「開角」期，左近一帶的鬥牛都在規定的地點匯集了。並没有特殊的鬥牛塲建築着，鬥牛塲就是臨時戽滿水的田。鬥前，由牛主人各僱了許多「帮手」，將自己的牛牽下田，（我記得那是用八條紅繩牽的）「帮手」都是赤着脚和大腿年青力健的。在這泥濘的田裏，二條牛就頭對頭地鬥起來，每次一對，分勝負後又另換一對。勝者就大吹大擂將牛牽回去；敗者則頽喪而歸，竟或將牛斬掉。</p>
<p>鬥牛專用於鬥，和平常的耕牛略有不同：身體碩大於常牛，性子也猛勇得多，它們也被取名，譬如我所記得的根叔吧，他曾養過一頭呌「鴛鴦」的鬥牛，也不知爲什麽這頭牛耍呌「鴛鴦」，我只曉得這是頭很會鬥而從未敗過的牛。「開角」期一近，他的生活就緊張了：忙着飼牛，忙着到牛欄裏給牛驅除蒼蠅，捉拿吮血的螞蝗，往往牽牛的孩子或是自已的孩子多吃了點飯菜他要輪起眼駡；而對「鴛鰲」則深恐它不肯吃。他親自調料，食料如小麥，荳，稻草，都經過細心的選擇的。猶其在鬥前一二日牛吃得更好了：如棗，參，「甘生」（一）一類名貴的東西都給「鴛鴦」當食料。臨鬥前，　或對之噴鴉片烟，據說這是能長勁的。「鴛鴦」的確能給根叔長面子，每鬥必勝，連那富冠縣東的趙剥皮財主家的牛都給鬥得大敗。大戶人家的牛鬥敗是格外塌台的。趙剥皮在鬥敗後挺挺小肚子說「狗養的，希什麽罕，不要臉丨下次再比過…」他的意思是根叔這邊的人在二牛相鬥時，向他的牛用了陰謀；而使他的牛「無心懲戰」了。而事實上呢，在趙剥皮第三次賣進一頭名「雙牙架」的牛來和「鴛鴦」鬥時，給人發覺那「拆牛」（二）的人，用針在「鴛鴦」的鼻上戳了一針，結果是「雙牙架」依然敗走：兩面的「帮手」打成一團。</p>
<p>也是這樣的一個晚上：有金黄月，蔚藍天，根叔的「鴛鴦」在白天又把趙剥皮第四次買進的一頭名牛鬥敗了。他微醺地打城裏回來。在二更時，有人發覺他已被尖刀重創在村外的一顆烏柏樹下了。他倒在血泊裏，尙能低微地說話：</p>
<p>「趙剥皮吧……把鴛鴦「付出」（三）去……我的後代不許養鬥牛丨不許……不要和趙丨趙結後報稅丨結不得……把鴛鴦快點付出去……」</p>
<p>多年未返故鄕了，禁不住又想起看鬥牛來，趙剥皮據說尙健在着，不知根叔的兒孫尙能依囑不養鬥牛也否？</p>
<p>（一）一種好的黄酒。（二）牛與牛症，或中止相鬥，或一牛被鬥敗時，可由「拆牛」人將二牛分開；猶如裁判員相似。（三）「付出」：將牛轉賣給别家。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>當要租定的時候，那三千佛郎的租費把他難住了，因爲定的時候就要付第一期的租金，而他什麽都没有，身上幾乎一文俱無。</p>
<p>他父親掙來的那筆小小的財産，每年僅只有八千佛郎的收益，他自己又不該許久還不曾選定一種行當，這樣學學又丢了，再從新另學一樣，常是弄得父母非常拮据。他這時祗得許下兩天以内給回信，離了那房子；他忽然有了一個主意，想等到哲安領到了遺産時，和他通融這第一期三個月或甚至半年的房租。</p>
<p>「這不過是幾個月的借欵罷了，」他心想，「我也許年内就可以還他。這是狼簡單的事情，並且他一定狠高興帮我這個忙的。」</p>
<p>因爲那時還祗四點鐘，而他又没有事可做，絕對没有一點事可做，便到公園裏去坐一坐；他在木凳上坐了很久，腦裏什麽想頭都没有，眼睛望着地面，被一種由窮困而來的疲倦所征服。</p>
<p>可是他以前過的那些日子，從他回家起，他每天都如此過去了，並没有這樣厲害的感着生活的空虛和無所事事的苦悶。他以前從早到晚究竟是怎様過去的呢？</p>
<p>他在漲潮的時候到堤岸上去閑逛，在街上閑逛，在咖啡店裏閑逛，在瑪洛斯科那邊閑逛，到處閑逛。一向過得安然無事的這種生活，現在却突然引起他的憎惡，使他感着難堪。如果他身邊稍爲有點錢，他會呌一部車子到鄕下去沿着那些被山毛棒和榆樹蔭覆着的田溝兜一個大圈子；可是他連喝一杯啤酒買一分郵票都得划算一下，這樣的逸興自然毫没有辦法實現的。他忽然想起一個人過了三十歲，還得時常紅着臉孔問他的母親討一個路易（合二十佛郎），這是怎样難堪的事；他一面用手杖在地上爬搔着，一面咕嚕道：</p>
<p>「哎！如果我有錢的話！」</p>
<p>於是他的弟弟得了遺産這念頭又像被蜂刺了一下似的竄過他的腦中；但他不願自己流入嫉妬，他焦燥地把這念頭趕走了。</p>
<p>他身邊有些小孩子在路上的灰塵裏游戲着。這都是一些披着金黄色的長髮的小孩子，他們現得狠認眞並且狠當心的樣子，把沙土聚成小山，然後再一脚踏破。</p>
<p>筆爾這天的心情狠憂鬱，在這樣的日子，我們會想起種種的心思，搜尋所有的衷曲。</p>
<p>「我們的勞働也和這些小把戲的工作一樣，」他心想。隨後他又想到最賢明的生活方法也許還得養下兩三個這樣無用的小東西，然後懷着滿足與好奇的心思瞧着他們長大。想要結婚的念頭輕輕地在他面前拂過了。結了婚，旣不再是孤零零的一人，便不會這樣寂寞了。當我們心旌搖動的時候，至少可以聽到有人在我們身邊動着，當我們痛苦的時候，能夠對一個女人說出「你」來，就已經不那樣寂寞了。</p>
<p>他開始想着女人。</p>
<p>他對於女人實在很少認識，因爲他在拉丁區祇有一些半個月的結合，這個月錢用完了時便分散，等到下個月有錢時又再結合起來或另外找一個。可是他想世界上總有一些非常純良，非常温從，非常可以安慰人的女人。他的家裏秩序井然，且極可愛，不就是因爲有着他母親的緣故嗎？他是怎樣的渴望着認識一個女人，一個眞的女人喲！</p>
<p>他突然站起身决定去看看陸醉米太太。</p>

<h3 id="c283">「拉鋸戰」 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>戰術，因没有學過，故不知究有幾種。但從讀報得來的經騐，知道論地形，有野戰，巷戰，空戰，海戰的區别；論兵器，有步兵戰，砲戰，以及大刀，肉搏等方式，至於「拉鋸戰」這一名詞，却並没有聽見過，有之，自湯劉之戰始，拉報如下：</p>
<p>四日北平電劉湯兩　在察東衝突後，連日來雙方已成拉鋸戰，</p>
<p>「拉鋸戰」，這確是一個新鮮的名詞。這名詞要是記者先生所獨創，丨大槪不會出自孫吳兵書，那末，該記者的天才實在是可佩的，因爲他用這三個字不但報告了新聞，而且把這次，以及前後千百次戰爭的内容性質，都報告下來了，大有太史公的筆意。記得小時在小說上見有所謂「車輪戰」的一法，是由幾個人輪流合戰一個，使其力竭易擒，其形式有如車輪的轉輾，蓋義取象形而兼會意，比也。凡使用這戰術的，多半是爲應付强敵，此法雖犯有衆暴寡的嫌疑，有失英雄的氣槪，但爲大敵當前，是顧不得這些的。「拉鋸」的取義，大槪就是「車輪」的流亞。</p>
<p>但二者之高下，有可得而論焉。</p>
<p>考拉鋸的形式是一東一西，一來一往，一進一退，若即若離，極雍容閑逸之致，兩者看似相爭，其實相成，所受難的，祗是介乎中間的木反之類，在此有秩序的爭奪中，而木屑紛紛下矣，而支體漸漸離矣。至於「拉」的雙方，則始終可保持這個方式，一來一往，一進一退的拉下去，不須變換，也絕無危險，丨丨所變換的不過是木反之類而已。拉鋸戰的方式，亦猶如是，一個「猛攻」，則一個「後退」，一個「反攻」，則一個「又退」，這樣一來一往，一進一退的「轟戰」下去，與拉鋸的形式，並無不同。而「車輪戰」則不然。戰法雖似巧妙，終嫌有窮兇極惡之相，爲大雅君子所不取。而在戰爭的過程中，也有齒輪輾上皮膚，或陷於泥中的危險。這大槪就是現代戰術家舍棄「車輪」而採取「拉鋸」戰法的理由。此亦戰術之一進化也。誌之，以備後之編文化史者的參考。</p>
<h3 id="c284">自新之路　陳老槐從監獄裏出來了 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>在離開監獄的那天早晨，他被帶到典獄官的面前。監獄官向他說了不少的話，敎他以後好好做人，望自新的路上跑。千萬不要再做犯法的事。他祗能憂鬱地望着他自己的肚子。</p>
<p>他的身體自由了，可是他的肚子　被　　了。在獄申他可以工作，可以有飯吃；然而出獄後，他該向那裏找工作做，找飯來吃呢？攏在他面前的是一座黑暗的冷酷的猙獰的都市，牠張着大嘴，牠會吞滅了渺小的他！</p>
<p>他記起了典獄官敎他自新的話，他祇能苦笑而已。他何嘗不知道做一個善良的人民，他有手也有腦，他出世的時候是和别人一樣的！</p>
<p>老槐曾經在中學裏畢過業，也拿到過幾次花花綠綠的所謂畢業證書。可是，那幾張紙頭換不到飯吃。他曾經在都市裏過過極困苦極悲慘的流浪生活。爲了他是男子，而且又不過是中學的畢業生，所以，他始終找不到職業。於是他不得不做犯法的事，用不正當的手段竊取别人的財物，終於他被利决坐六個月的牢。坐牢，他並没有什麽悲哀，至少，在牢獄裏可以免了像在外面一樣地打募一塊大餅的費用。這是没辦法的事，當一個人肚子餓了身上冷了的時候是没能力抵抗的。善良的意志束縛不了一個飢寒交迫的人的。</p>
<p>可是現在他出獄了，他從前的那些寒的痛苦又將光臨到他的身上。</p>
<p>起初，他想求乞。後來想求乞的生活始終不是他所能忍受的。他應該找一些工作，他要把以前犯法的恥辱用他的力氣，汗珠，血腥來洗刷他。</p>
<p>於是他茫然不自主地衝進一家店舖：「有工作給我做嗎？無論什麽事都好。」</p>
<p>結果，他是被踢出來了。</p>
<p>身體上的痛苦使他清醒過來了，他茫然地苦笑着。這是他應該受的苦痛，一個熟人都没有，他可以請求他們給他一些工作嗎？</p>
<p>他流浪着，回不得家鄕，找不着事做，甚至於一塊燒餅也不能使他得到。社會對他好像貓對老鼠一樣。他得不到同情，他只得到了殘酷的獰哭。</p>
<p>最後，他死了。他並不是開了旅館服安神藥片的，他也没有洋洋大觀的遺書。他在社會所注意不到的當兒死在一條有惡臭的小溝裏，他脫離了痛苦了，他的靈魂得到了最後的安慰。</p>
<p>死只有死是他底自新之路罷？</p>
<h3 id="c285">蠶 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 忠柱</p>
<p>「現在的人生有没有意義？」這個問題的答案，在現世的人死後是否有一定的歸宿的問題未解决之先，我們總要先認牠是有意義的。如果人們死後眞有一定的歸宿，那末現世的生活也不過是曇花一現罷了。你就是生而夭亡也没甚麽要緊，因爲這現世不是你永久的處所，早晚是要離開的。如果人們死後没有甚麽魂靈存在，也再没甚麽永久歸宿的地方，那末我們就應該看現世的生活的極有意義的，而且一分一秒的光陰都不可輕易的錯過，更要努力做一番事業，庶不致空此一生。</p>
<p>但是這問題在未能解决之先，我們只有兩條路走去。如果你看現世的生活是無意義的，你就不必再把那「態度消極」。「及時行樂」，「吃齋念佛修來世」，等名辭來做口頭禪，奠若乾脆自殺，因爲你這樣苟延殘喘的活在世上，與那種蠧的生活又有甚麽分别，與你自己旣没甚麽好處，或者社會多添一個寄生蟲，有没有這個人，有甚麽打緊。不過現在的一般人，或者也許藉着這種種的名辭蔽住人們的眼簾却暗地裏去做戕害人生的事，這種蠧不獨自身不能存在，就是我們也决不能容他存在。</p>
<p>如果你看現世的生活是有意義的，你就立刻起來。因爲現世的生活無論是有無意義的，就好比舞臺上的一齣戲罷了，戲裏有主角有配角也有龍套，在這現世舞臺上，你做什麽角色，都没有人給你規定；但你願意做主角也可，做配角也可，甚至做龍套亦無不可，總看你的努力如何。那末你這現世才不虛此一行了。倘不然，當這無聊的時代，在這無聊的國度裏，徒然苟活，那就成爲更無意義的事了。</p>

<p>— 欲歸</p>
<p>天低低的好像就壓我們頭頂上似的，天氣是那樣的奥悶，使人不信已在重陽後的深秋。從窗隙間望見的大上海的天空，似乎没有那高崇的建築物就要掉下來似的，在這樣的天氣，丨最容易引起人悲懷的天氣，不是嗎？暖洋洋的像艶陽的初春，然而没有春天那般的鬆快，活躍；如其下一個不甚適當的譬喻，大槪和黄梅時節有些相像。在這裏呆瞧着天空的有一位多感的青年，他有長長的頭髮，深奥的一雙眼睛，和一張瘦削的臉，他像感到什麽痛苦似的，儘緊鎖了雙眉瞧着窗外，從早晨到現在，我們没有瞧見他移動視線。</p>
<p>他所佔有房間，是一間小小的樓，安放了寫字檯和書架之外，僅有一張床的餘地了。房間内的一切都堆置得十分零亂，正像這小樓的主人，這時候的思潮一樣。靠着窗口的壁上，掛着一張少女的半身放大像，她是微笑着，一如想起了一件什麽得意的事，那樣地無邪，那様地嬌媚：假使說青年的視線注視着這張像片，我們或者也不致於猜得一點没有理由。</p>
<p>眞的，他仰起頭來了，對着像片的玻璃，攏了攏被風吹向前來的頭髮，他忽然微笑着向外走了。</p>
<p>門前是一條熱鬧的街道，一切都是沸騰着，青年踏出門來，被一羣黄包車圍了攏來，但是他没有說一句話，從容的跨過了車槓，頭也不回的向那邊清靜的路上去。他低着頭，雙手伸在褲袋裏，一對皮鞋去凑着人行道上的水門汀方塊，這種無聊的舉動，在他是新變的態度，近幾天他老是這末來着。</p>
<p>他走到了一個電車站，向西面一望，似乎不預備在他的行程上會走到法國公園來似的自己笑了起來，大槪他也没有一定的目的地，就在安南巡捕面前顯示了派司踏進法國公園，突然他像被什麽攝住了的一怔，那他房中照片上的少女，等候着他似的微笑向他招呼，當然，他是没有預料在這樣的場合會遇見她；雖然隨即很鎭靜的回禮，但是不自然的態度在少女的胸中是一目瞭然的。</p>
<p>「蔚，你收到我的信嗎？」女的問。</p>
<p>這時候也手中正握着那封信。昨天他接到後，鼓起了幾次勇氣，仍没有撕開牠，現在遇見了寫信的主人，他狡滑的點了點頭代替了回答。兩個人就踏着色不迷人人自迷</p>
<p>小路向園内走去，默默的，像没有留意旁邊有人伴着走路。</p>
<p>「蔚…」她抬起頭來，望見了他感傷的臉，把欲說的話嚥住了。</p>
<p>「什麽？」他是太虛心了，因爲他没有知道她信上寫着什麽話，如其這時候有一秒鐘的機會給他看這封信，他不知怎様驚喜若狂哩，所以聽見她欲言又止的神氣，他感到太對不住菲了。用「菲，你怎想起到法國公園來？」的問句來掩飾。</p>
<p>「自從我將照片送到你小樓之後，我就放開了心胸，本來我是個無覊的女了，我想愛情總不能屈服我的，但是我們分别了半個月，我天天被苦悶襲擊着，我不能再這樣受罪了。我每天將下午消磨在這裏，但是歸去後給我更大的悽凉，不過我不能再有别的方法了。鼓了三夜的勇氣，寫那封短短的信給你，希望你每天能到這裏來陪着我走走，我没有他的奢望。…</p>
<p>蔚聽了她不能繼續的嗚咽聲，他纔瞧清她的臉上已掛着兩行清淚，自己心中難言的隱痛，也想放聲一哭，不過他竭力强制着嘆了一口氣說：</p>
<p>「菲，在我們相見的時候，我不料會達到今日的局面，我無嘗不想見你，但是誰能允許我們這樣做，這種强制執行的苦况是彼此相同的。我老實說，你昨天寄來的信，還原封的在我袋…」他說着將信從口袋裏拿出來。</p>
<p>「如此你怎知道我約你在法國公園呢」</p>
<p>「好罷，菲」他没有回答她的話，繼續說下去「我想搬家，搬到你的附近，把我們的精神結合起來安放在一件工作上，我也不能再受這種苦悶的痛苦了。」</p>
<p>兩個都免强的一笑，像對於他們變態的戀愛得了一點小小的結果。</p>
<h3 id="c287">我們青年應該向那裏走 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 時中</p>
<p>現在我們青年感到國家内災外侮。禍亂相循。並且世界各國羣趨爭奪的情勢。愈形惡劣。這個不景氣的時候。實足使我們青年生活容易發生恐慌。思想容易汚化消沉。精神和光陰容易無謂的消耗。意志容易搖動埋没。以致發生許多不求進步自暴自棄的消極態度。眞是何等可惜和不好的慘痛現象。因爲我們青年是國家未來的主人翁。就是將來社會的維持者。若是這樣順流而下。將來國家必定還要比現在不堪收拾哩。就是世界也是這樣。雖然造成現代青年這樣的慘狀。是封建敎育的遺毒。是社會貧富不均不合理的社會制度。是世界社會上維持者的愚蠢自私和侵略魔術造成的。但是我們也應當深究這種原因。且看現在各國盛唱什麽歌曲呢？無非是什麽産業復興。什麽五年計劃和十年計劃。什麽外貨重徴稅率。什麽國貨保障和减出口稅。什麽統制。什麽尙武精神的自衛。什麽軍備增新。這種種各興各個國家的衰頽。我們不敢非難。但是單想擴張自己的力量來爭奪市塲。刦掠人家的財物來補救各自人民的生活。置世界整個興替於不顧。總之仍向愚蠢自私侵略的老路求復興。不想切實改善適應時代合理生活的制度。和産業復興同時進行。恐怕未來的結果。未可樂觀。所以空望的安樂世界勢必遙遠。若是我們青年懷抱着靜待太平世界。逢時遭遇的時候。實行自己的懷抱。這是不可能的事。或因此而遂萌消極思想。日漸汚化。那末更是不對了。我們青年應該想到。世界是誰創造的。不是什麽神。也不是什麽英雄豪傑。是各個人的思想演進造成的。換一句講。過去的不景氣現象是誰造成的？是過去各個愚蠢自私的我造成的。旣是這樣。那末我們青年應當負起創造未來生活均衡幸福。合理社會制度的責任。不要單是重責他人。而自己發無責任心的怨言。簡直的講。世界不是一二個人的才智所能創造和維持的。幸福不是單靠他人可享的。是靠各個我的羣體的活動奮鬥。都負創造和維持社會責任可得到的。這是時代告訴我們。我們青年覺得須要淘汰一切封建社會遺下和習俗的劣根性。養成高潔的思想。奮勇的精神。堅决的意志。戰勝一切困難。才能逐漸達到我們青年合理原望的目的。現在希望我們青年應具的態度如下。</p>
<p>一，不要因生活恐慌。把高潔思想汚化消沉。</p>
<p>一，不要因生活恐慌。把奮勇精神和光陰無謂消耗。</p>
<p>一，不要因社會上無多大學問的人。操縱一切的一切。而把求學的意志搖動埋没。</p>
<p>一，不要因打算虛榮而後退。</p>
<p>一，不要因社會上謀事困難而消極。</p>
<p>一，不要因河山破碎。國步艱難。目覩慘狀而自殺。</p>
<p>一，不要因失却戀愛而厭死。</p>
<p>一，不要握着封建迷夢而等待。</p>
<p>一，要繼續求深切學問的思想。</p>
<p>一，要振作勇敢敬謹做事的精神。</p>
<p>一，要堅决向光明前途求合理生存的意志。</p>
<p>一，要淘汰封建迷夢薰陶和習俗的劣根性。</p>
<p>一，要尋求勞苦工作來補救實際生活。雖千辛萬苦不辭。</p>
<p>一，要在勞苦工作外。每三仍舊不斷地幾小時的閱讀書報。</p>
<p>一，要確切研究社會上過去不景氣的原因。</p>
<p>一，要負創造自己生活幸福。和合理社會生存均衡幸福的責任。</p>
<p>槪括講一句。很希望我們青年。在困難環境中。决不可畏縮靜待。因爲世界的演進没有停頓的時候。個人的生活不能因靜待。而衣食住行可暫延擱。祇容我們青年要抛却一切虛榮。由營苦工作。尋求逐步推進的出路。纔能得到光明的前途。在現社會上倘没有勢力。不論什麽事情。想舉手可得的機會方便。是萬萬没有的。所以不得不在艱難困苦的時候。創造自己的機會。應該做工也好。種田也好。一方面勞苦工作。一方面研究學問。祇有把堅决的意志。奮鬥的精神。個人才能達到生活幸福的日子。國家才有眞正復興的一天。</p>

<p>我們離别故鄕，在我們結婚一月之後。我們的結合，旣是舊式，更在新婦進門一月之内，發生了變故，使我們不得不離别故鄕而投進上海的抱懷中來。自然，我們在結婚之前，無戀愛可言；結婚以後，亦無蜜月可渡，所幸舊式婚姻底戀愛的開始在結婚之後，這條定律没有欺騙我們。逃出了故鄕的壓迫，在上海居住到這間小樓中來的時候，没有誰能相信我們僅是結婚一個月的新夫婦。蔚年齡雖幼，很能知道大體，因爲我初到上海時的職業是新聞記者，朋友旣多，交際亦廣，出入於我們小樓的，蔚能落落大方的應付，就是我不在家的時候。而對家庭的内務，能烹調，能縫絍，性情愛潔，小小的樓中，雖是三尺地，却不使人感到不安。致於我們的進欵，布衣淡飯，也好應付裕如，在我們之間，似乎需要一個小天使，蔚將常這樣期望着。</p>
<p>我們的結合，日常生活，旣如上述。他可說一天到晚在外面，很難得有半日以上的時間安坐在家中，我知道他並不是忽略了對於妻的撫愛，他是爲了我們兩個人的生活而生活；但是一個脫離了母親的懷中而爲人妻的少女，在異地寂寞的時候，她所希望着的是什麽？一個小天使，我是這樣的期望着。不過，在我結婚後的年齡記錄上增加了兩歲，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>我的希望還是落了空。</p>
<p>於是蔚將希望移愛到小貓身上。去年秋天，牠討來一隻白貓，僅僅在背上有二塊銅元大的淺灰色。蔚爲牠特製了一床小被褥，舖在一個木箱中，每晚臨睡，她先迷迷地呼牠進房，輕輕的捉進木箱後，自己才肯安睡。日後這小貓也知道了規定的時間，到時候不必呼喚，牠乖乖地睡在木箱中了，頭，四肢，都曲在一起，背部微微的起伏，那二個淺灰色的圓形也怪好看的一起一伏，蔚老是拍着手說：「這貓眞好啊！」</p>
<p>貓雖確是可愛的動物，我愛貓爲了消遣的我寂寞，没有事的時候我捧着牠玩，牠的前爪能夠洗面，牠還能仰起頭來呌人家吻牠。牠曾走失過兩天，我四處找尋，都不見牠的影踪。牠說：「恐怕我們有小貓玩了。」果然，牠回來後腹部漸漸膨脹，我爲了預備了生産時的一切，在今天春实姘牠生了兩個和母親同樣可愛的小貓，就在這時候……</p>
<p>就在這時候，經醫生三次的檢定，蔚已懷孕了，小天使的熱望漸漸和事實接近。她忘過了小貓的生産，再爲小天使打算，買了許多便宜的面料，絨線，甚致於搖籃，蔚籌備着一切；而這時候那白貓領了兩個小貓失踪了。是否牠知道將失去我妻子的愛撫，或者牠已不須要人類的帮助了？在雙十節的前二天，我們的小天使呱呱墮地，他脫離了母胎，望見了這世界，他哭，哭什麽？誰都不知道！新的希望雖然從母親的心田中滋長起來，可見一顆純潔的小魂靈却投進了這汚濁的世界！</p>

<p>— 茂德</p>
<p>前幾天寫了關於好萊塢的一個可愛的小孩子，以及好萊塢影戲公司如何保護大演員的方法之後，覺得關於這些小演員的生活，頗饒興趣，現在再寫這篇，講講這般小演員的日常生活以及他們如何化錢的方法，告訴告訴我們中國的一般小孩子，尤其有錢人家的小孩子們，學些他們的省儉，仁愛，以及其他許多的美德。</p>
<p>講起這許多聰明可愛的小孩子，普通人總以爲他們能獻身於銀幕，是一種幸運偶然的事。當然，他們在許多聰明可愛的小孩子當中，獨能獻身銀幕，而還有許多聰明可愛的小孩子，爲什麽不能獻身銀幕，這一點不能不歸之於命運之一說。但是，我們要知道這些獻身於銀幕的孩子，他們所享受的地位與榮名，確是當之而無愧的。他們當中没有笨孩子，傻孩子，或討厭孩子的。所以這就不能全歸之命運了。他們各有他們的天才，一旦發現之後，可以說平常的孩子是望塵莫及的。有的時候，這種天才確是可遇而不可求的。往往一家公司，試騐了幾百幾千個孩子，檢不出一個滿意的，而偶然遇到一個，却一上鏡頭就成功了。</p>
<p>這些小演員們，雖然他們的形貌動作傳遍了全世界，他們所賺的錢，勝過了許多銀行家，大腹賈，但是他們的父母，却絕少不明事理，加以溺愛，而養成他們驕縱暴戾的性情的。這些小明星當中，最温文爾雅的，要算是大衛多倫了。有一天一位新聞記者去訪問他的母親，看見他在門口，和一隻没有家的小貓玩。他敎着它英文。那隻小貓是鼠色的，骯髒得很，普通的孩子，是不要的，但是大衛却問着他母親道：「母親，這隻貓我們養了它，好不好？怪可憐的，它没有地方去呀！」大衛的薪俸，平均是每星期五百美金。合到我們中國的錢，差不多每月的收入要上萬了，但是他每拍一張片子，他母親祗給他五塊美金，而這五塊美金，他竟全數的貯藏起來了。他母親說：「大衛從來不知道怎様化錢的！」</p>
<p>賈京古柏在小明星當中，要算是薪俸最大的了。他的薪俸是每星期一千三百美金。合到中國錢，要到兩萬多塊錢一個月了，但是賈克自己却從來没有看見過錢，他的母親全數收起來了。從前他母親每星期給他五角錢。現在他的年紀，一天一天大了。最近他的零用錢，已經增加到每星期三元，但是早飯却要他自己買來吃的。有時候隣居的小孩子，還可以吃到些冰淇淋，因爲賈克是很喜歡交小朋友的。</p>
<p>還有一個狄克穆爾，據他的母親說，他是很浪費的。他母親每天給他一角錢，但是到手就用完了。他到現在還欠他母親一角二分錢，而欠他父親的，恐怕有五角錢了。這個話給狄克聽見了，他很難爲情似的從他的小皮包裏拿十二分的錢交給他母親道：「母親，我不是浪費的，我還你一角二分錢。我欠父親的錢，我和父親講過，用擁抱和接吻折算，不用還他的了。」狄克穆爾每星期的薪水，是美金四百五十元，但有空閑的時候，他還想去賣報紙賺些零錢化。</p>
<p>還有許多從前享遇盛名的小演員。譬方說賈克柯根，他做了幾年影戲，賺了不少錢，有人說竟有五百萬美金之多。他現在大了。已經進了大學，所學的係戲劇學。還有一個從前和亞爾喬爾生合演過「小寳貝」的大衛李，他曾轟動過一時，全國的大戲院，曾經請他豋過臺，賺過每星期四千五百美金的大薪俸。但是他現在亦長大了，不能再裝小孩子了。現在亦已經進了學校。將來很有再上銀幕的機會，因爲影片公司裏，還常常收到要求他重新上銀幕的希望也。</p>

<h3 id="c292">「慈母恨」“Ｐilgrimage”　丨丨大光明丨丨 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 蘼蕪</p>
<p>▲前言</p>
<p>和中國電影一樣，美國片最近也觸到一些社會問題了。這當然是可喜的現象，雖則有時候，客觀的現實會給主觀的意識歪曲。但是美國的藝人們，不肯閉了眼睛，在腦子裏剏造一些全不現實的故事，已經證實了。</p>
<p>▲「慈母恨」</p>
<p>我誠實的把這本「慈母恨」，推薦於中國電影從業員，和電影批評者之前。這並不是說：「慈母恨」是一張超羣拔萃的影片，我的推薦這張「慈母恨」，是爲了它是非常値得注意的片子，至少有幾點。</p>
<p>故事只不過說，「子有戀人，母固執，不欲他們結合。設法使其子從征，死焉。後見另一同處此境之情侶，依依之態，大悔昔日所爲，力勸另一情侣之母毋執已見，使之結合，已且迎寡媳及孫同居」！</p>
<p>當然，這一個故事，並不是愛國主義者，因爲母親的使兒子從軍完全爲了破壞他戀愛結合，這故事是現實的，但給他們觀念化了。因爲他不去說明這種事實的本質，而只說明個人感情的悔恨，是不夠的。而我特地把這片推薦給從業員們者，首先就是這張影片是以農村做背境的。以農村做背景的中國電影。是太多了，我希望我們的從業員；看看人家的以農村爲背景的電影。其次，就是在題材感到狹窄的中國電影，是應該向别方面開展。像「慈母恨」的故事，就是一條路。（我自然不希望完全學它。）</p>
<p>現在寫下一些編劇和導演的手法。</p>
<p>第一，少年從田中歸來，氣喘連連，一望而知工作太勞，母親遂令之休息。但母親一走開，他就急於看他的愛人，拔步飛跑，全無倦態，實在是很眞實很仔細的描寫。</p>
<p>第二，少年夜赴愛人家，母親因犬吠而開窗遙望。因而望見，而這條犬和少年，在事前，經過一度的親近，所以少年走而犬望之而吠。是極合理的！</p>
<p>第三，母親因不贊成少年的所爲，而使之從軍。因此，少年戰死的噩耗傳到時，她悲哀並不深刻，只到房間裏，把已經撕碎的照片，併好看看。</p>
<p>第四，少年從軍時上火車，愛人送之，他在火車開去的畫面之後，接着一個是愛人面部特寫。這時他把火車的聲音配上。火車機輪聲由緩而急她的面部表情；由平常而悲慘。汽笛一聲，淚珠迸落，汽笛聲由近而漸遠，畫面漫漫「淡入」，汽笛終於不聞，畫面也就淡到没有。這種聲與影的配合，用得非常得當。能夠使觀衆的視覺聽覺，同時感受！</p>
<p>第五，他把鷄犬做故事中的穿　，這不僅是點綴品而已，簡直與劇情有關，上面第二點，已經說明了。</p>
<p>第六，他緊緊的把握着母親的個性，而把故事展開，他在母親没有悔恨之前，始終把母親寫成一個極剛强的女性，卽到悔恨以後，她的行爲，也極堅絕，没有十分猶豫。</p>
<p>第七，回憶的畫面，用得適當。同時他不但回憶畫面的光線和一般畫面不同，回憶畫面，並且極快的不停留的掠過，使人一看就知道這是回憶。</p>
<p>第八，他寫母親的悔恨，一定要在赴法憑吊之時，在看到同樣境地的情侶依依之日。這和無條件的立刻覺悟，是不同的。</p>
<p>夠了，舉出了八點値得注意的地方。最後我還應當說的，就是女主角的表演也不錯。</p>
<h3 id="c293">評「奮鬥成功」ＴheＭanＷohＤared　丨福斯出品　南京開映丨 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>大凡一個電影故事拉得太長，常使人感覺散漫而零亂。不久的以前開映的「亂世春秋」，也是有一個冗長的故事。自一八○○年寫到一九一八年的大戰終止。可是因爲導演的成功，以及全部工作人員，都非常愼重其事。所以關於那一影片的評價，並不因其故事的冗長而忽略其他技術上的優點。</p>
<p>這張「奮鬥成功」的影片，同樣有一個冗長的故事。自南北美戰爭終結的一八七一年起，直至祖孫三代，延長至六十餘年。因爲要將這麽多年的事實，在幾千呎的片子中演出來，於是平均每一段落，都只能很簡單的佔着影片的一小部份。更因爲導演不善於處理，所以我們在這一影片却祇是看到非常零碎小節，絕對找不着比較精細的描寫。</p>
<p>我們並不說長的故事，一定要不得，而是說必須在其中抓住一個中心，而加以盡量的發揮，不必要的地方只好使之帮助重心的發展。現在我們不妨就編劇方面加以研究。</p>
<p>在這一影片中，很明顯的作者要盡力誇張民主政治的存在。於是劇作者說明主人翁强恩是在極小的時候，便隨着貧苦的父母到美國做移民。他的父親死於礦山的爆炸之中，自身長大後亦爲礦工。然因父母的勉勵和自身的勇敢堅毅，終於由一工人而貴爲芝加哥市長。最後因暴徒刺殺總統，悞死，代替了總統的災難。主題旣然是要說明所謂民主政治的合理，那末對於這所謂勇敢者，也並不需要從六十年前寫起。充其量，劇作者祇是要說明强恩的父親是一礦工，幷且對兒子懷着遠大的希望。那末，我以爲只消從父親早餐時聽着汽笛上工，在勉勵之後，死於礦山時爲止，卽開始寫他以後之志願和發跡。同時更着重在他所以發跡的當時，發跡以後也未常不可發鬆。這中間有好些段落是可以放棄，如嫁妹子，生女兒等等。至少這些關鍵可以在談話中道出。特别是後幾段的演說和對新聞記者談話，却又因對白過長，而愈顯沉悶。</p>
<p>導演者用了許多「淡入」「淡出」，使人感覺十分零碎。然而有些Ｄesolve倒還有意思。劇作者如此，導演者亦復如此，於是形成這平凡的電影了。</p>
<p>此外表演者亦不見有使入興奮之處，男主角由青年扮到老年，全無年齡的變換在動作上表現出來。尤其是老年時更覺失敗。然而比較的飾强恩父母的，雖然塲面不多，却令人有眞切之感。</p>
<p>對於美國所流行的民主政治如此誇張，自然是美國人應有的表現。然而一個工人是否眞正能夠如此發跡，我希望我們不必如此妄想。不過作者的企圖到底是可笑的吧。尤其是在瘋狂的「白宮風雲」之後，又有如此作品出現，使我們覺得美國影壇眞是奇形怪狀了。</p>
<h3 id="c294">「獸國奇觀」評　Ｕbangi　丨新光映丨 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>關於獸片的意義，已經給許多電影批評者正確的指出了。當然，不外鼓動民衆開發邊疆的興趣，和滿足人們的好奇心。</p>
<p>本來獸片假使用新聞片的方法，不加故事進去，只把猛獸的生活狀態介紹出來，未始不可給那落後的一些地方，没有動物園設備的人們，增加一些知識。可惜他們偏要每一張獸片都必需引起一個無味的故事。</p>
<p>「獸國奇觀」也是這一類的片子。他的特點只是把他的作用指揮得更充份些。好像中間：</p>
<p>（一）黑人大舐獸骨中的脂肪。</p>
<p>（二）黑人偷喝飼獸飲料。</p>
<p>（三）白人鞭策黑人，使其唯命是聽。</p>
<p>都儘量的描寫出黑人的愚順可欺。不但如此，他更寫白人給黑人西服穿，以雷酬報，而加深他們的欺騙。我記得半年以前，有幾張獸片結束處有一個最忠心出力的黑人，穿了西服很高興的在大汽船的餐室裡，隨着白人進餐，理由實在太明白了。</p>
<p>「獸片」第一需要緊張，因爲猛獸是的確很兇猛的。同時非極度緊張，也不足以滿足好奇的觀衆。所以「金剛」之類，不惜用攝影技術來增加他的緊張和恐怖，而這張「獸國奇觀」却太髮弛了。原因是没有使「猛獸」做戲。這當然是導演的責任。</p>
<p>鏡頭方面，特寫用得太少，使觀衆對於「猛獸」没有很大的注意。盡　的注意於柔美的風景，而不注意於險峻的山嶺，也是不對的。因爲這也能使影片鬆弛下去的。</p>

<p>八點鐘是老早過了。派卡德夫婦和泰爾堡夫婦亦都來了。預先没有請，臨時拉來凑數的親戚，亦都來了。蜜麗遜提足了精神在招待著，一點不露生氣的樣子。她對派卡德宣佈著芬克力夫不來的消息，說芬克力夫勳爵得了急病，必須立卽送到福羅利達去。派卡德眼睛釘了他的太太一下，心中有說不出的痛苦。蜜麗遜就拿他們夫婦引到泰爾堡夫婦一起。派卡德和泰爾堡很高興地談論著高爾夫和騎馬。但是寳勒呢？奥立佛呢。勞萊瑙德呢？喀羅妲范絲呢？這頓飯吃得成吃不成呢？什麽時候　能完呢？她無精打采地想著。最後，她吩咐先進各克泰爾吧。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the unresolved incident in the Okamura Special Trade Zone, except for the fact that our side can receive all the passes of the Great Wall immediately, which is no longer a problem, there is still a considerable distance between the two sides' opinions on issues such as postal service, customs, and transportation. These issues will need to be gradually negotiated and resolved in the future. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Of all the negotiations that Okamura has conducted during this visit, only the issue of receiving the Great Wall passes has been relatively concrete. Other items, such as postal service and customs, have only been exchanges of opinions, and no specific solutions have been decided. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura visited the Summer Palace this morning and will host a banquet for He and Huang at the Japanese Embassy tonight, inviting Yin Rugeng, Yin Tong, and others to accompany them. He is scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow morning. Our side will send Yin Tong to accompany him. After meeting with Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin, he is scheduled to take a plane back to Changchun on the 12th. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Okamura, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin from Ping on the morning of the 10th and visit Chairman Yu in the afternoon. After a short stay in Tianjin, he will fly back to Changchun. The Kwantung Army will send a plane to Tianjin to pick him up. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi hosted a farewell banquet for Okamura, Kita, and others at the embassy at 7:00 PM on the 9th, inviting our military and political authorities to accompany them. Okamura will visit Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin on the morning of the 10th and plans to stay for two or three days before flying back to Changchun. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Beining Railway Bureau is actively preparing for through train service and will transfer staff from the Guandong (Kwantung Leased Territory) section to serve on the trains. Through train service between Ping and Shenyang is expected to be realized by the end of this month. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that the through train service between Ping and Shenyang was decided upon at a bureau affairs meeting, and then submitted to the Ministry of Railways for review. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has sent a special commissioner to Beiping to assist in the handling. The matter is currently under negotiation. Regarding this issue, our side has formulated a principle, striving to comply with it. If any item does not comply, it will not be implemented. En Yi is the head of the Beining Railway, and trains should originally run to Liaoning, but vehicles from other railways will definitely not be allowed to run on the Beining Railway. All measures are currently being discussed but have not yet been decided. Xia Guangyu, a counselor dispatched by the Ministry of Railways, is currently contacting all parties. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of direct through train service on the Beining Railway, the Beining Railway has formulated a negotiation plan and submitted it to Xia Guangyu, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, to be forwarded to the Ministry of Railways for review. If it is deemed feasible, it must be submitted to the Political Readjustment Council for review and approval before being handed over to Yin Tong to negotiate with the Japanese side. Before it is submitted to the Japanese side, the content of the plan will be temporarily kept secret. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Formal Negotiations in North China; The Central Political Council Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday; Wang Sent a Telegram to Huang Fu Instructing Him on Matters <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that a newspaper report stating that a certain important person from Jiangxi telegraphed his opinions when the Central Political Council discussed the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the 8th was not true. The so-called important person from Jiangxi refers to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang was in Nanjing last week, and President Wang also just returned from Jiangxi yesterday. If there were any diplomatic opinions, they could be discussed face-to-face. There was no such thing as a telegram. The spokesperson also said that a newspaper report stating that Chiang and Wang, after discussing matters in Jiangxi, sent a telegram to Huang Fu of the Beiping Readjustment Council, who was negotiating with Ariyoshi on issues such as through transportation, customs, and postal services, instructing him to adhere to a fair attitude, was also inconsistent with the facts. He also stated responsibly that no formal negotiations were being conducted in North China. Most of the North China news reports about Sino-Japanese negotiations were based on talks by Okamura of the Japanese side. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 9th, a temporary Central Political Council discussion meeting was held. Wang reported on the recent diplomatic situation, and many members expressed their opinions, but there were no resolutions. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The rumors of partial Sino-Japanese contact seem to have originated from exploratory talks on issues such as through transportation and postal services on the Beining Railway. Reliable sources have learned that although Ariyoshi, Shibayama, Sugimura, and others from the Japanese side have had several exchanges with our country's North China military and political authorities, both sides have only engaged in ordinary social interaction because they lack government instructions. The government's position is still based on the principle of non-recognition of the puppet Manchuria and non-abandonment of sovereignty. Therefore, further negotiations are difficult to realize at this time. It is said that after Huang Fu telegraphed to the Central Government for instructions, the members of the Central Committee conducted informal consultations on various branch issues in North China on the morning of the 8th. As for whether President Wang's trip to Jiangxi was related to this matter, the outside world lacks a clear understanding of the truth. It is vaguely heard that Wang telegraphed a reply to Chairman Huang after returning to Nanjing, instructing him on matters. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Guihua: Huang and Zhao are scheduled to depart for Bailingmiao at 7:00 AM on the 10th, with Xu Tingyao accompanying them. Their special service team, a platoon of more than sixty people, arrived in Sui by four cars on the night of the 9th and will escort them on the 10th. Along the way, the cavalry stationed in Wuchuan County, Sui, will be responsible for security. All of Huang's entourage are scheduled to depart in two batches on the 10th and 11th, leaving one person stationed in Sui to liaise. Li Songfeng took three cars of gifts from Huang and Zhao to various princes and officials, as well as supplies, to Bailingmiao early on the 9th to make arrangements. The Sui Provincial Government sent four armored vehicles and a guard platoon to Bailingmiao to provide security. Huang and Zhao's gifts include silk, tea, and autographed photos. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian accepted the invitation of Prince De and Prince Yun and plan to go to Bailingmiao on the 10th to provide guidance. It is heard that Huang telegraphed to Nanjing, saying that the princes and officials still insisted on their own views a week ago. Recently, Prince De accepted the Central Government's advice and agreed to abandon the highly organized autonomous government. Observing the situation in the future, the princes and officials have no major objections to the Central Government's proposal to sequentially complete the Mongolian autonomy plan, with each banner as an autonomous unit, supporting the Mongolian people, developing the economy, and improving animal husbandry.

<p>(Beiping) Huang and Zhao will go to Mongolia tomorrow to meet Prince De and participate in the Bailingmiao conference. Most of the princes and officials of various leagues and banners have already left Bailingmiao. Now, because Huang has decided on the date of his trip, a small number of princes and officials have returned to prepare to welcome him. Prince De does not express a firm commitment to forming a government, but most of the people still strongly advocate breaking away from the scope of the Sui Provincial Government. The Panchen Lama, in addition to advising the princes and officials to obey the leadership and support of the Central Government and wait for Huang to come to Mongolia to resolve the matter, plans to leave Bailingmiao immediately and inspect various leagues and banners.

<p>(Beiping) When Fucheng was recovered, Endo of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Yu requested Zhang Xiguang, the commander-in-chief of our security forces, to have Zhou Yuying's troops return to Tianjin and Dou Xizhe's troops return to their original defense in Changli. Fucheng would be garrisoned by Liu Zuozhou, and Zhang was given a deadline of the 10th to provide a satisfactory reply. Zhang telegraphed Yu Xuezhong for instructions. Yu telegraphed Zhang on the 8th, stating that he had requested Huang to negotiate with Okamura in Beiping regarding Endo's requests. The Luandong bandit suppression troops are not directly responsible for diplomatic matters. Zhang then sent a staff officer to Yu to meet with Endo and convey this intention. Zhang also went to Yu on the morning of the 9th to discuss unresolved matters regarding bandit suppression. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The remnant bandits of Qi Wenping, who withdrew from Fucheng County, are now mostly gathered near Xuangezhai and Taitouying, looting along the way. Our security force, Dou Xizhe's troops, have not actively pursued them towards Jielingkou due to diplomatic relations, but have sent out many scouts to investigate the bandits' tracks. It is reported that two platoons of Japanese troops and one battalion of Zhang Hai peng's puppet troops are stationed at Jielingkou, making it impossible for the bandits to cross. Therefore, many bandits have recently abandoned their weapons and fled, numbering about several hundred. It is also reported that there have been bandit disturbances in Yanheying for several consecutive nights. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fucheng County was recovered, the remnant bandits crossed Huaguoshan, exited the small passes of the Great Wall, and attempted to flee towards Rehe Province. They are now gathered in the Yushulinzi and Huashudianzi areas, numbering about 2,000 to 2,500 people. There are about three to four hundred people in the Wenquanyu and Xingxingyu areas, in a very distressed state. The Japanese side has requested to transfer Liu Zuozhou's security force to garrison Fucheng, but we have not yet agreed. Zhang Xiguang went to Yuguan again on the morning of the 9th to meet with Staff Officer Endo to discuss the matter. The Luandong bandit suppression headquarters is about to end, and Zhang Xiguang is scheduled to return to Tianjin within the next few days. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fucheng County was recovered, the merchants and residents had suffered greatly and were unable to resume business.

Xia Chengen, the head of the provisional maintenance committee, was ordered to be dismissed on the night of the 8th due to accusations of betraying someone.

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov, via Germany and France and across the Atlantic Ocean, went to Washington to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt to discuss the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations, which had been frozen for sixteen years, may be opened from this point forward. Not only will the European political situation undergo new changes as a result, but the Pacific Ocean is also likely to be affected. Judging from the current world economic situation, capitalist countries, in an effort to barely maintain the status quo, can only hope for a new market to serve as a place to absorb their existing manufactured goods. Therefore, they are all focused on China's market. However, since the September 18th Incident, China has been repeatedly subjected to external pressure, resulting in its entire economy being in an irretrievable state. Other regions have all been delineated and are not easily surpassed, and there is no resolute determination to take military risks. It is difficult to hope to win the market through peaceful means. Unable to do so, they think of the next best thing, and the only way out is to turn their wheels to the markets provided by socialist countries.</p>
<p>The United States, therefore, abandoned its traditional views and discarded its past debts between the U.S. and Russia, and first engaged in restoring normal diplomatic relations. During the process of restoring diplomatic relations, the issue of ordering goods was discussed. Some people in the United States even hoped for huge amounts of credit orders to stimulate the U.S. market. The temporary excitement that the United States is currently experiencing due to the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act has not directly put the manufactured goods into the hands of consumers, but has been manipulated by speculative merchants and remains stockpiled in warehouses. After September, the market turned downward again. If there were no influence of expanding the munitions industry and stimulation of the inflation policy, the economic situation today would inevitably be more decadent. Therefore, it is urgently seeking to restore U.S.-Soviet relations. If the economic relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union can turn into a normal state, then the unbalanced economic situation may be temporarily stabilized.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Japan's military policy continues unabated. To the north, it threatens Siberia, at least with the force of seizing fishing rights in the Sea of Okhotsk and the oil mines on Sakhalin Island. To the south, it has the ambition to dominate the Western Pacific in order to hold back the U.K. and U.S. and dominate East Asia. In this situation, the United States is unable to restrain it with an inferior navy. It has no choice but to politically enlist the Soviet Union as support to curb the progress of Japanese militarism. Amid the low-pressure atmosphere in Western Europe and the war clouds looming over the Pacific, the news of the restoration of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations has brought a glimmer of light to peace. A second world war seems to be temporarily delayed.</p>
<p>However, can peace be relied upon? Can a second world war really be avoided? Assessing the situation, I know that it must not be. First, the relationship between Japan and the U.S. will not be eased just because the U.S. withdraws the Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic for training. As for the competition between Japan and the Soviet Union over Northern Manchuria, a direct conflict is ultimately unavoidable. The issue of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is just one aspect of several issues. Even if this issue can be resolved, other issues will still exist. We can see the conflict that cannot be avoided between Japan and the Soviet Union by looking at the words of Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat.</p>
<p>The Soviet government authorities are usually cautious in their foreign affairs and would never be so light with their words. Just watch their silence for the last two years for proof. On the recent 16th anniversary of the October Revolution, Molotov of the Soviet political authorities said, "... At present, the danger of a military attack on us is particularly serious. Therefore, we must pay full attention to the imperialist plans to undermine peace..." Regarding Japan in Manchuria, he directly pointed out that "Japan is the actual owner of the puppet Manchuria, and its responsibility should also be borne by Japan..." At the same time, he also criticized Japan's blind and ridiculous adventurism and directly condemned its plans of forceful seizure as shameless. Such blunt statements are difficult to bear not only during the day but also in normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, at this time when the restoration of U.S.-Soviet relations is about to become a reality, what good does it do to make such harsh and rigid remarks? Can Japan thoroughly realize its situation?</p>

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol released tonight that he has received replies from ten countries regarding the proposal to not recognize the Manchurian puppet organization, and none of them disagree. Although the United States made a few small statements as exceptions, their nature is said to be enough to increase the strength of this proposal. It is also heard that the United States stated in its reply that if the puppet organization applies to join any international treaties, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the U.S. government is prepared to ignore it. Furthermore, the replies from various countries fully support the League of Nations' recommendation. Only the Siamese government replied that Siam has no direct relationship with this matter, because no relationship has ever occurred between Siam and Manchuria, and it is unlikely that there will be any relationship matters in the future.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations, on June 14 of this year, notified the member states and non-member states of the League of Nations with the plan of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" proposed by the Advisory Committee, and also sent a letter to the 18 countries represented in the Committee, saying that if they do not receive a letter of opposition, the plan will be regarded as established. The countries then replied one after another. The League of Nations today announced the summary as follows: The United Kingdom replied that two conventions were omitted from the notification: (1) the Submarine Safety Convention, (2) the Cargo Capacity Convention. Mexico expressed its agreement to the principles of the notification. The United States replied that the United States' opinion on the issue has not changed in principle and is willing to express its agreement to the entire text, except for a few articles and conclusions that are only of an advisory nature. Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Colombia, and Nicaragua replied that they are considering the various plans mentioned in the notification. India replied that India has the same attitude towards this matter as the government. Siam replied that they have no relationship with Manchuria and are therefore not directly related. Egypt replied that it deeply sympathizes with the various plans, and its final attitude is willing to be consistent with the member states of the League of Nations. The United States has made reservations on this notification: (1) the opium recommendation, (2) the non-approach to "Manchukuo" extends to treaties other than those in Geneva, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact signed in Washington. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee decided today that any references to the Manchurian puppet organization in the report to be sent out soon will be written as "Manchuria and Rehe, also known as a Manchukuo." This technical name was decided after the committee members were aware that Secretary-General Avenol stated last night that major countries almost unanimously advocated maintaining the policy of non-recognition of the puppet organization.

<p>(Moscow) It was heard today that the Soviet authorities have warned the Japanese Acting Consul General in Vladivostok that, in the future, should any Japanese aircraft enter Russian territory without Soviet permission, unpleasant consequences will ensue. This warning follows the recent intrusion of Japanese military aircraft into Russian territory. Although Tokyo has denied this incident as recently as the 5th, it is generally believed here that the Japanese government's denial is a diplomatic maneuver and that the Japanese authorities have not conducted a thorough investigation to disprove the incident. It is also reported that Chairman Molotov of the Soviet People's Committee stated in his recent speech that the Soviet Union is prepared for the possibility of a sudden Japanese attack, and the intrusion of Japanese aircraft is part of the reason. Although officials are not commenting on the warning to Vladivostok, political circles largely believe that it is tantamount to a declaration that if Japanese aircraft attempt to enter Russian territory again, they will be shot down.

<p>The Hague: The arrival of Leno, the former German Colonial Minister, has attracted general attention, as the Dutch government has recently been working hard with Paris, London, and Washington to establish an agreement to prevent the Dutch East Indies from being invaded during wartime. In a speech at the French Club here, Leno strongly refuted the pessimism expressed by Clemenceau in the past that Asians and Europeans would one day be destroyed, and stated that the spiritual shock that has occurred among the various nations of Asia is even greater in Vietnam than in the Dutch East Indies. He attributed this mainly to the forceful imposition of Western culture on the East by Western countries and the lack of respect for the good old customs of Asian nations, which has led to this situation. The people of the colonies have now all been infected with European customs, and he fears that this will eventually lead to unrest. Leno also said that the danger of communist propaganda in the Far East is being exaggerated, and only the nationalism stirred up by Moscow is to be feared. Now, all countries with colonies should cooperate closely, especially the Netherlands, France, and Britain. (8th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov met with Secretary of State Hull at the State Department this morning to discuss the issue of US-Soviet diplomatic relations. During the meeting, a large number of police officers patrolled the State Department. After the meeting concluded,</p>
<h3 id="e27">Joint Communique Issued <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>It stated that this meeting was purely a private conversation and that the two men discussed several outstanding issues between the US and the Soviet Union in a very good atmosphere. Litvinov did not make any specific proposals. President Roosevelt invited Litvinov to lunch at the White House. At the end of the meal, the two men spoke for another half hour. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After yesterday's meeting between Secretary of State Hull and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, a communique was issued, stating only that they will meet again on Thursday. Other than that, no other information about the content of the talks was revealed. Those present at yesterday's meeting between Hull and Litvinov included Under Secretary of State Phillips, Cone, Assistant Secretary of State Berle, Director of the Agricultural Relief Bureau Morgenthau, and State Department official Hackworth. During Litvinov's stay in Washington, the police authorities took extraordinary measures to ensure his safety. When he went out, police officers on motorcycles protected the car. Near the meeting room of Hull and Litvinov in the State Department, there were more than 40 plainclothes police officers secretly protecting him. Litvinov's unofficial Soviet representative's residence was also guarded, and there were even police officers on the roof. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Tonight, it is widely predicted here that the United States will recognize Soviet Russia within 48 hours. This prediction is largely based on the statements made after the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and US Secretary of State Hull. According to the joint declaration issued by the two men, it can be seen that no problems arose during today's talks that could be considered serious. Also, according to unofficial sources, many problems that could hinder the negotiations have been largely agreed upon during unofficial talks between a certain Soviet country and the US diplomatic representative. Therefore, it is heard that after Litvinov and Hull talked for two hours today, both sides felt deeply gratified that they had completely agreed on important matters. Some observers even expect that Litvinov will go to the White House tomorrow to discuss the final arrangements for the restoration of diplomatic relations. However, these reports have not been confirmed by officials. Furthermore, attention is being paid here to the Reuters report that the Ecuadorian Congress has passed a resolution to recognize Soviet Russia. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) According to an investigation by a reporter from the New York Evening Post, President Roosevelt and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov have determined the basis for an agreement between the two countries during their talks yesterday. The United States will probably announce its recognition of the Soviet Union on Friday of this week. The newspaper also said that the issue of the Russian Kerensky government borrowing US$22.5 million from the United States, as well as US lending to Russia, will be resolved in other ways. In addition, a US-Soviet committee will be established to be responsible for studying the issue of US private claims against Russia, which total approximately US$400 million. Finally, the newspaper also said that Litvinov is seeking to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the United States, the content of which is roughly similar to that concluded with other countries.

<h3 id="e28">Litvinov's Declaration to American Reporters: This Trip Is To Seek the Restoration of Normal US-Soviet Relations: To Break Down the Man-Made Barrier of the Past Sixteen Years: Soon We Will See What Kind of Disappointment the Enemies of Peace Will Reveal! <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(New York) When Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov entered the port of New York on the ship Byrengaria, the Director of the Treaty Department of the US State Department and a large number of reporters boarded the ship to welcome him. When Litvinov traveled from New York to Washington, Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State and the President's Secretary were waiting at the station to greet him. Subsequently, Mr. Litvinov, accompanied by Mr. Hull, visited President Roosevelt at the White House for a brief talk. Litvinov then made a statement to reporters, saying that his trip, in a certain sense, was to make the first breach in the man-made barrier that has blocked normal relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States for sixteen years. He clarified that the people of the two countries have never stopped observing each other's development with the utmost sincerity and sympathy. Mr. Litvinov continued, "Although formal contact has been lacking, they have deeply felt (and still do) that they are united by a common effort to fight for peace. The efforts of the two countries to safeguard peace are proceeding along parallel paths. However, the unification and expansion of these efforts have been hindered by the lack of the usual tools of normal contact, which could make them powerful factors for peace and one of its most solid guarantees. Since the exchange of letters between the heads of the two countries was published, the comments made on it around the world have shown what kind of hope the friends of peace have placed on the establishment of strong and lasting friendly relations between the peoples of the world's two great republics, and what kind of disappointment the enemies of peace have revealed." Mr. Litvinov also reiterated the friendly response of the American newspapers and public opinion to Roosevelt's move and expressed his confidence that the American newspapers will not refuse to provide assistance and sympathy to the subsequent efforts to establish formal Soviet-American relations.

<p>Sengcheng, Germany: German Minister of Aviation and Prussian Prime Minister Goering traveled to Italy for business and has recently returned to Germany by plane. (8th Havas She Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) In view of the European reaction caused by yesterday's disarmament debate, the tension caused by Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations is unlikely to reach the point of ignition. The foreign ministries of all countries are now engaged in the work of attracting Germany back. After General Goering's talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, France's opposition to Germany has now weakened. Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in the House of Commons yesterday was satisfactory to Paris and regarded as moderate and appropriate by Berlin. Simon's statement that it is important for Germany to return to Geneva is also the view of France. The recent speeches by German Foreign Minister Neurath have been seen as a sign of peace. Italy is eager to resume international discussions but especially wants to use the Four-Power Pact forum. The Tribune published an article showing authorization that said that the Geneva mechanism is no longer valuable and criticized Handerson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, for traveling around the world. The article also said that Simon's speech was a repetition of Britain's usual empty talk, that is, Britain has done its best to reduce armaments. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) During tonight's House of Lords debate on the disarmament issue, Lord Hailsham, Minister of War, said that German Foreign Minister Neurath did not mention the word "sample" when answering the meaning of Germany's so-called sample armaments. Once the treaty is signed, Germany will immediately re-equip its armaments according to the last level it received in order to achieve equality. Lord Hailsham also said that the crux of the issue is that, on the one hand, Germany's anger at the inferiority of its armaments can be alleviated, and on the other hand, Germany's reasonable security requirements can be met. Without reaching this point, there will be no real progress. Great Britain is actively consulting with the powers with the largest armaments on the aspects that should be revised or destroyed in accordance with the treaty. Great Britain does not object to any kind of disarmament that can be accepted by the great powers. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The disarmament issue debated in the House of Lords tonight will be submitted to the House of Commons on November 13. The Labour Party has decided to file an impeachment motion against the government's disarmament policy. Tonight, Labour members of the House of Lords criticized the government's inaction, saying that Foreign Secretary Simon's speech failed to make them understand that the government is now taking concrete actions to promote disarmament. However, former Indian Governor Lord Lyttelton said that the government has done its best to seek peace and that the country's disarmament has reached a dangerous point. Secretary of War Hailsham defended the government, pointing out that the Labour members' suggestion that all countries should reduce their armaments to the same standard as Germany is an absurd suggestion that is impossible to implement and will never be accepted. Former Lord Privy Seal Cecil took out a French newspaper article, saying that it was an answer to German Foreign Minister Neurath's article and was related to the British, French, and American treaty. Cecil claimed that since there is no such treaty, there is no such document. It seems that this document was the answer given by the German ambassador when he was asked what Germany's so-called "sample" armaments actually were. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met, and Foreign Minister Pongu reported that diplomacy focuses on the issue of disarmament. Pongu described the good results obtained in diplomacy one by one. He believes that the most important thing is the unity of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in the Geneva camp. Regarding the rumors outside the diplomatic relations between Britain and France, which are disturbing to hear, in fact, the friendly relations between Britain and France are extremely close. Even if there are slight differences of opinion, it is more superficial than substantive. Speaking of the issue of disarmament, the Foreign Minister said that the principle of arms inspection has been recognized by the great powers. This may be one of the reasons why Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the unilateral disarmament conference, because Germany wanted to avoid the obligation to be inspected for disarmament. Pongu also said that the improvement of France's diplomatic relations with Italy and Soviet Russia has been facilitated. He then spoke about the Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss's struggle against National Socialism, what policies France has adopted, and provided various explanations of the course of France's diplomatic negotiations with Dollfuss, which were very beneficial. The Foreign Minister then described the situation in the Saar mining area, saying that the area will soon hold a people's vote in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles to decide whether the area will belong to France in the future, remain under the administration of the League of Nations, or be returned to Germany. When the vote is held, it must be guaranteed that the people can vote freely, and those who support maintaining the status quo or support being划歸 to France must be guaranteed their safety. The Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved Pongu's statement of diplomatic policy, except for the vote of the leader of the right wing, Maran. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today's Strong Will Report published details of the new-style defense works newly built by France on the eastern and southeastern borders, known as the steel backbone defense line. They have been managed using the technology of the new era for four years, and have now finally been completed. The border area is built with winding deep trenches that cannot be destroyed by bombs. On top of them are solid small defense shelters, like a string of beads, forming an unbreakable line of fire. Each battery has shelters, as if they protrude from the ground, surrounded by deep trenches and remaining barbed wire obstacles. The gray turrets are protected by steel walls and are not afraid of artillery bombardment. Large-caliber artillery positions and machine guns are placed on both wings. If the enemy approaches the battery, the artillery fire will be intertwined, making it impossible for people to stand. The artillery positions are all set below the ground, and those who use machine guns also have extremely secure protection, and use a very complex method of circulating air, so that fresh air can be filtered through the world's most effective gas absorber and transmitted into the trench. The entrance to the defense shelter must pass through a movable large bridge. If attacked by the enemy, it can be rolled into the turret. The depths of the surrounding trenches also have automatic large steel plate doors that can be used by the defenders to fight back hard. The entrance to the center of the battery is like the entrance to an underground railway, from which you can reach an underground city. Several trains will be used to transport troops, bullets, and food to supply the entire line. Each battery is equipped with elevators, electric motors, and artesian wells. The ammunition depot is located in a very deep place and has double doors as a barrier. The fuel and oil stored underground can be used for the entire fleet. (9th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Havana: Revolutionary action has now broken out again, and the situation is still extremely chaotic. The Army Staff Department claims that all armed areas in the country are assisting the government, but most of the troops are clearly supporting the rebels. For example, the air force began attacking the presidential palace last night, and the artillery also joined the rebels. Air force officers want to support former President Cespedes to return to office and have submitted an ultimatum to President San Martin, demanding that San Martin resign at 11:00 this morning. Street fighting is still taking place in the city. Seven hundred rebel soldiers in the Columbia city barracks have been surrounded. The situation in the interior is still unknown.

<h3 id="e41">British House of Lords Debate on China Policy: Lord Peel Advocates Strengthening Britain's Position in China, Emphasizing the Development of the Chinese Market for Imperial Trade, and Assisting China with Constables to Restore Order in the Yangtze River <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) In the House of Lords today, former Secretary of State for India, Lord Peel, during a debate on British policy towards China, praised the inherent commercial realism of the Chinese and their diligence in business even in adversity. He continued by saying that while Britain should indeed develop trade with Russia, it should pay particular attention to the Chinese market because the Chinese people are more numerous and China is more amenable to trade concessions. British policy towards China is always important, but especially so today, given the changing world situation and the difficulties facing British trade.</p>
<p>Revising the Attitude Towards China: He wondered whether the government, in light of this new environment, had also considered revising its attitude towards China. The current government's policy towards China has an excessive tendency to drift with events. If the Chinese believe that we are merely observing, then we cannot hope to gain their respect. Other countries are not relaxing in the slightest and are constantly eager to consolidate their position in China.</p>
<p>Against Financial Assistance to China: Lord Peel then spoke of the success of the Nanjing government and T.V. Soong, saying that Soong had resigned from the war, but he felt that Soong would soon reappear. Britain has known China longer than any other Western country. History proves that Britain has no aggressive or territorial ambitions. Britain's policy in India has proven that Britain does not seek any dominant interest in China. Britain can assist China with constables, so that order can be gradually restored in the Yangtze River basin. If order in the Yangtze is not restored, then none of the Nanjing government's plans will be able to bear fruit. He did not advocate providing financial assistance to China.</p>
<p>The Issue of the British Envoy's Residence: Lord Peel then spoke of the issue of the British envoy's residence in China, saying that while he did not suggest that the British envoy should reside in Shanghai, he felt that many difficulties had arisen because there was insufficient contact between the British envoy and the British community in Shanghai. As for the issue of re-assigning the ambassador, he felt that Britain should send an ambassador to a country in the Far East as important as China.</p>
<p>Maintaining Troops Stationed in Shanghai: Lord Peel concluded by speaking about the Shanghai issue, citing the Feetham Report, especially the section on the independence of judges, saying that this is an international issue that requires the cooperation of the powers. He also said that the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai occurred at the same time as the construction of large Japanese barracks in Shanghai. He felt that the current moment is the most opportune time to re-define policy towards China.</p>
<p>Supporting Peel's Proposals: Sir Holroyd, a director of Imperial Chemical Industries, supported Lord Peel's remarks and spoke of the company's director, McGowan's, travels in China, hoping that other British industrialists would do the same. Lords Lugard and Eddington then spoke in succession. Eddington was the Custodian of Enemy Property in China from 1923 to 1928. He advocated that the embassy should not be located in Peiping and expressed regret over the reduction of British troops stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lord Stanhope Speaks: Lord Stanhope spoke, saying that Sun Yat-sen had invited him to participate in one of China's revolutions. Regarding trade with China, he welcomed McGowan's visit to China. The British government holds a sincere and friendly policy towards China. Britain's goal is to maintain good relations with organized governments. Britain is willing to accommodate the national aspirations of the Chinese people to the greatest extent and recognizes the powerful national sentiment throughout the country.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Constable Assistance <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Should be Proposed by China: Therefore, he felt that the first step in Lord Peel's suggestion that Britain could assist China with constables should come from the Chinese side. If China does make such a suggestion, then the British government will certainly be willing to consider to the best of its ability what kind of assistance can be given to China.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Relocation of the Embassy <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Not Necessary at Present: As for the issue of relocating the embassy, it has been considered for a long time, but the government does not believe that relocation is necessary. It is still questionable whether relocation can increase the efficiency of the embassy. Furthermore, sanitation and expenses should also be taken into account. The Chinese government has moved its capital once or twice. If the British embassy moves to Nanjing, there is a risk that this move would be futile. Furthermore, from a health perspective, Peiping is better than Ningbo and Shanghai, and Shanghai is particularly objectionable. Shanghai has its own special difficulties, and it is feared that the British envoy stationed in Shanghai will divert his energy. As for Lord Lugard's proposal to continue allocating funds from the Boxer Indemnity Fund for the expenses of the University of Hong Kong, the British government has no right to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Actions Towards China <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Strive to Avoid the Suspicion of Interference: In summary, the difficulties of China continuing to move forward are ones that the Chinese people can solve on their own. In this regard, the British government has taken more actions than other countries to express its friendship and sympathy for reasonable wishes. It is not easy to see what Britain can do without involving the suspicion of interfering in China's affairs. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>The Government Considers it Inadvisable: (London) The government representative replied to Lord Peel in the House of Lords yesterday, stating that the British government considers it inadvisable to move the British embassy in Peiping to Nanjing, but the issue of whether the British envoy should reside in Shanghai or Ningbo will not end as a result. The Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to The Times today, saying that with the cooperation of the Chinese people, the British can accomplish much, as evidenced by the establishment of customs and postal services, and Simpson's dredging project in the Yangtze River basin. However, it is questionable whether the British in Nanjing can move the Chinese as the Americans have. If the British envoy resides in Nanjing himself and is not six hundred miles away from the administrative center, then the situation may be different. The British envoy's departure from Peiping for Nanjing is truly abandoning the most beautiful city and moving to a new capital under construction, but this move by the British envoy can at least be dutiful to Britain. Many people with relations to China have long advised the government to establish a residence for the British envoy in Ningbo or Shanghai, and other countries' envoys to China spend most of their time in Shanghai, which Britain can emulate. It is generally believed that Parliament will propose this matter again soon. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">King of Afghanistan Assassinated: Crown Prince Ascends the Throne at Only Seventeen Years Old, British Government Greatly Concerned Upon Hearing the News, British Troops in Northwest India on High Alert <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Kabul: King Nadir Khan of Afghanistan was assassinated at three o'clock yesterday afternoon in the palace by a trusted courtier. His son, Zahir Shah, succeeded him to the throne. The new monarch is only seventeen years old and is expected to be assisted by his uncle and Prime Minister, Hashim Khan. After the sudden incident, the authorities immediately cut off transportation and imposed strict security, while investigating the inside story of this act, including whether there was a conspiracy to assassinate the entire royal family and whether the army had any disloyal intentions. Regarding the assassination of the king, only the announcement that King Nadir Khan had been assassinated by a traitorous minister has been issued, while other details remain secret, as there is a strong suspicion that there is a political assassination group attempting to assassinate the royal family, such as the assassination of the brother of former King Amanullah, Aschas Khan, by a twenty-seven-year-old student at the Berlin embassy on June 6 of this year. At the same time, the king's nephew, Adak Khan, was also seriously injured, and it is feared that there may be some clues related to this assassination case. Therefore, the Afghan authorities are currently conducting a strict investigation in Berlin and domestically, because since the deposed King Amanullah visited Berlin in 1928, the city has become the most intensely contested place for various factions in Afghanistan. According to reports, the late King Nadir Khan was Amanullah's nephew. In 1929, after Amanullah was driven out by the rebel Habibullah, the government troops finally recovered the capital, killed Habibullah, and enthroned Nadir Khan. The city of Kabul is as peaceful as usual. Upon hearing that the new monarch had ascended the throne, the people flocked to the vicinity of the palace to pay their respects and celebrate, expressing their loyalty. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>New Delhi: The British Embassy in Kabul has verified the news of the assassination of King Nadir of Afghanistan and said that the assassin was a student, probably one of the Afghan students previously expelled from Germany. There are concerns that the barbarians on the British border may take the opportunity to pour into Kabul to plunder, but the Afghan army has sufficient funds and good discipline and may be able to support the new monarch. According to a Bombay dispatch, the entire country of Afghanistan is now in mourning for Nadir and has unanimously announced its allegiance to the new king. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Emperor sent a telegram to the new King of Afghanistan today to express his condolences. A Rome dispatch states that former Afghan King Amanullah, upon hearing the news of Nadir's assassination, stated that he was not involved in any disturbance. Afghanistan does not yet have sufficient education to accept new policies, so he does not wish to return to the throne. According to general opinion in Rome, if the people of the country unanimously wish him to return, then Amanullah can return to his homeland. He is very happy residing in Rome, and his young children have almost forgotten Kabul, while his eldest son is currently working as a lawyer in Rome. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the British government received an official telegram stating that the assassin of the King of Afghanistan was a student, not a courtier. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is greatly concerned upon hearing the news of the assassination of the King of Afghanistan. Officials in the India Office remained on duty all night, closely monitoring the development of events, fearing that all Islamic regions would be affected and new disturbances would occur in the area near the border between India and Afghanistan. British troops stationed in northwest India are on high alert. Here, the news of the King's assassination was first received by the Afghan embassy. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Afghan Ambassador to Britain took a flight from here to Paris this morning to discuss the current situation with the Ambassador to France, and then to the Afghan capital, Kabul. The Afghan Ambassador to France is the brother of the assassinated King Nadir. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the circumstances of King Nadir's assassination are still in question. Even the Indian Foreign Ministry has not received news of the King's assassination, relying only on Reuters' news for information. Nadir's assassination is likely the result of infighting between supporters of Nadir and those plotting the restoration of former King Amanullah. Nadir had a brother killed in Berlin, and political assassinations have repeatedly occurred in Kabul last year, all due to infighting between the two factions. Nadir was fifty-three years old this year. In 1929, King Amanullah abdicated and power fell into the hands of Habibullah. Nadir led troops to resist and won a great victory. On October 16 of that year, he ascended the throne. Amanullah was previously abandoned by the people for vigorously implementing new policies and reforming old customs, but some places still admired him, and after several years, the past was gradually forgotten by the people. Therefore, Amanullah was unwilling to remain an exile for long and was said to have intended to return to his homeland. Kabul's Acting Foreign Minister told a Reuters reporter that the authorities had been concerned about the occurrence of events for some time. The opinions of various parties in Afghanistan are deeply divided, and it is difficult to predict what will happen next. When the king was assassinated, the prime minister and foreign minister were not in the capital. The prime minister is loyal and is Nadir's half-brother, so he should be loyal to Nadir's son. The crown prince is twenty-one years old and has his father's style. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

Currently, one issue is released every two months, and it is expected that the annual surplus will be around 20 million yuan. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Gansu Various Associations cabled Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, stating that "Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces have suffered frequent disasters in the past five years, and rural areas have gone bankrupt. The existing troops are already unable to supply them, and it is urgent to reorganize them to reduce the burden on the people. This is one reason. If 90,000 more troops are added, even catching sparrows and rats will not be enough to maintain them. Second, for troops to reclaim land, they must have strict discipline, be able to endure hardship, and be effective. The history of Sun's troops is well known. If they are placed in Western Qinghai, they will absolutely not be able to settle down and engage in land reclamation. This is the second reason. Furthermore, the ethnic groups in the Northwest are complex. Will these 80,000 to 90,000 troops be able to coexist peacefully with the troops in this area? In case of unexpected changes, what will the future hold? This is the third reason. In short, the arrival of Sun's troops has a hundred disadvantages and no advantages. Because the supply is huge, the rural areas will become even more bankrupt. It is an attempt to reclaim land but actually increase荒. If Sun's troops come and an unexpected incident occurs, it is an attempt to consolidate the border but actually disturb the border. In consideration of the survival of the people in the Northwest, the defense of the Northwest border, and the future of the country, the vocational associations hope that the government will consider and retract the order.

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government returned to Fujian on the Yingrui warship from Nanjing on the 23rd of last month. It has been over half a month, and he spends his days touring mountains and rivers, not discussing state affairs. He has a very leisurely attitude. From the 24th to the 26th, he stayed at the residence of his clansmen in Chengpu Tou, Fuzhou, and visited Cangqianshan, Gaigai Mountain, Hongshan Bridge, and the West Park. On the 27th, he returned to Shanggan Township to worship ancestors, Fenggang Township to sweep tombs, and Lujia Township to inspect elementary schools. On the 29th, he went from Shanggan Township to Qingzhi Temple (under the jurisdiction of Lianjiang County) for sightseeing. On November 2nd, he went from Qingzhi Temple to Fulu Temple (under the jurisdiction of Fuqing County) for sightseeing. He only returned to Fuzhou on the 8th. He is now awaiting a meeting with Chiang Kai-shek before accompanying Navy Vice Minister Li Shijia on the Yingrui warship to Sanduao to inspect the naval port, and then he will return to Nanjing. Lin's entourage was very simple during this trip. Except for staying at the private residence of his clansmen in Fuzhou and lodging at the Qingzhi and Fulu temples, he stayed in the Hai Ping steamship prepared by the Mawei Naval Port Headquarters. As for banquets, except for attending a public banquet given by his clan in the ancestral hall of Shanggan Township, he declined all other banquets. However, he would caress and examine antiques presented by antique dealers, and he would inquire about old friends in detail. If they were poor, he would give them money, but if they asked him for a job, he would decline, citing financial difficulties and personnel congestion. (November 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Guo Rudong's Troops Destroy Bandit Nests on the Hubei-Jiangxi Border, Destroyed the Pseudo Northern Route Headquarters <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The counties of Xiushui, Wuning, Tonggu, and Ruichang in northern Jiangxi, which border the counties of Chongyang, Tongshan, and Yangxin in eastern Hubei, have the Mufu Mountains, which are the watershed between the two provinces. The terrain is treacherous, the atmosphere is closed, and Peng Dehuai established a bandit's nest here in 1927. After Peng's bandits fled south to the border area of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong, Kong Hechong occupied it again, using Longgang Yanxia Youju Paibu Jiugongshan Pao Mountain and Lieyao Mountain as their nests. They established various pseudo-organizations, and their poison spread to dozens of counties on the borders of the three provinces. Last year, Chairman Chiang himself supervised the suppression of the Red bandits in the three provinces of southern and eastern Hubei, and the bandit nests were successively recovered. However, Kong's bandit nests were still not completely cleared due to the complex terrain. The communist leader Zhang Tao took the opportunity to summon and reorganize the remnants of southern Hubei and set up a pseudo Northern Route Army Headquarters in Dawu Mountain, where Wuning and Xinyang meet, to command the bandits in southern Hubei. They echoed each other with Kong Hechong's pseudo Sixth Army Group on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, and with the bandits on the border of eastern Hubei, Henan, and Anhui. After He Jian moved into Pingxiang, he ordered the 123rd Corps to advance toward Li Tianzhu, Kong Hechong, Cai Huiwen, and Zhang Tao. Guo Rudong of the Third Corps moved into the Yanxia bandit area and coordinated with Yue Sen and Tao Guang of northern Jiangxi, and Chen Guangzhong and Li Jue of eastern Hunan to besiege the bandits. They also paid attention to reconnaissance of the bandits' tracks in order to attack them unexpectedly. On October 21, Guo's troops ambushed at Gaojia Mountain and captured Zheng Xianglin, the company commander of the special task force of the pseudo Northern Route Headquarters, and seized letters written by the bandit leaders, learning that the pseudo Northern Route Headquarters and the Southeast Soviet Government were both gathered here. Therefore, he divided his troops into five routes, secretly and rigorously searching Dawu Mountain, Dongkeng, Meikeng, and other places, and destroyed the bandit's central organs. Yesterday, the Corps Commander Chen Jicheng telegraphed Chiang to report the victory. The original telegram stated, "According to Division Commander Guo Rudong's telegram, according to the captured bandit company commander Zheng Xianglin, an intercepted letter from bandit Chief of Staff Deng Gongheng to bandit Northern Route Commander Zhang Tao revealed that the bandit's general organ was near Mount Yaolie. I immediately dispatched parts of the 151st and 152nd Regiments and the engineer battalion in five routes to search Dawu Mountain, Dongkeng, Meikeng, and other places in Wuning, destroying the bandit's Northern Route Headquarters, General Hospital, military clothing factory, supplementary battalion, and cadre training team, killing over 200 bandits, capturing over 70 bandits, including Zhang Nianyou, political commissar of the bandit's 9th Regiment, and Cheng Chongyan, political commissar of the bandit's 7th Regiment, rescued hundreds of refugees, seized seven guns, three telephones, one load of Western medicine, a "bundle" of a 1:100,000 scale map published by the bandit's red printing bureau, and various important documents. The remaining bandits fled into the deep mountains." After Chiang received the telegram, he issued an order to commend them, saying, "This division's success in destroying the bandit nests is due to prior preparation, planned reconnaissance, and swift and secret use of troops, which enabled them to achieve great results. In addition to issuing an order to commend them in order to highlight their achievements, it is hoped that the subordinate units will be informed."</p>
<p>The Headquarters received a telegram from Songpu from Peng Zhenshan, commander of the 30th Division, reporting to Chiang on the progress of advancing to suppress the Red bandits on the border of eastern Hubei, Anhui, and Henan, stating, "Following Commander Sun's (Lian Zhong) order to suppress the bandits in the west, the bandit nests in Gengyang Zhenshan, Daxiaojunshan, Ziyangshan, and Yaojiazhai have been broken, and many pseudo-organs and bandit repair shops have been destroyed. The remaining bandits fled in two groups, one group of over a thousand people fled to Laojun Mountain, where they were intercepted by the 13th Division, and the other group of several hundred people fled to Tuanbanhe Qijiasakan. I led parts of the 30th and 31st Divisions to pursue and eliminate the bandits from Macheng to the north." He was also ordered to be commended. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Under the Oppression of the Communist Bandits, the Tragic State of the People in the Bandit Areas, Economic Panic, Forced Issuance of Public Bonds, Using Large Meetings to Coerce People into Joining the Bandit Army <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Since the Communist bandits have been surrounded and blockaded by the National Army, internal panic has become increasingly serious. The latest situation of the bandit side is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the economy: 1. Attempt to sell 3 million in public bonds, 2. Vigorously carry out land investigation movements and report on the locations of rich peasants, 3. Actively promote thrift movements, taking all food savings to help the war effort, 4. Use lectures to promote the sale of public bonds. At the meetings, all personnel from organizations and groups should enthusiastically speak, and deductions should be made for public bonds from food savings. Regarding military affairs: 1. Each county and district should try its best to expand the bandit army, with all Red Guards joining the bandit army, 2. The bandit leaders, seeing that forcing people to join is not as effective as deceiving, enticing, and threatening, have implemented the following measures: (1) The trade union announces that if trade union comrades do not attend when concentrated, their land will be confiscated, (2) The Communist Youth League committee should nail a "shameful plaque" on the door of those who do not join the Communist Youth League International Division. The bandit military department should assign them to forced labor teams, (3) The slogan used to deceive workers is "Joining the Workers' Division can get good land", or "If you want to get land, you have to be a bandit soldier", (4) When mobilizing the (model battalion) Red Young Pioneers to join the bandit army, do not do any mobilization work in advance. When it is necessary to concentrate in Ruijin, just say that you are going to Ruijin to attend a meeting, (5) Use two silver dollars and one luo of grain to buy a person to be a bandit soldier, or imitate Huichang by using three to four silver dollars to buy ten people to mobilize, (6) Imitate Changting's method of mobilizing model regiments to join the bandit army, deceiving them to cooperate with the Eastern Army to fight the 19th Route Army, opening to Hetian, and then explaining that they are joining the Workers' Division, 3. Launching the Workers' Division has caused a serious phenomenon of the Workers Division and the Communist Youth League International Division scrambling for soldiers, 4. Those who do not become bandit soldiers will have their property sealed, 5. Designate how many bandit soldiers to expand, 6. Copy the names of the masses aged 16 to 45, and the district Soviet will immediately send people to this village (to give the "glory plaque"), and designate the concentration by name, 7. Use the opportunity of opening a mass meeting to close the front and back doors, and ask them to register as combatants. Regarding the prevention of desertion: 1. Try to provide food so that there are no parts of the country where they only eat one meal of porridge a day (which shows the suffering of the bandit side), 2. Report the reactionaries and strictly prevent those who are forced to desert in batches (which shows that most of the bandits want to surrender).</p>
<p>Regarding political work: 1. Organs and political commissars should guide the organization of "shouting" on the front line, and suitable personnel are required, such as enemy soldiers, many from Hunan, so more Hunan people are sent to be responsible for shouting, 2. It is strictly forbidden to scold stray soldiers, 3. The bandit side is extremely panicked by internal shaking and has shouted the following slogans: "The enemy has built so many fortresses, how long will it take to finish fighting", "The enemy has more planes and also releases poison gas, we have no way to deal with it" (it is noted that the National Army does not use poison gas, and small leaflets have been made by the political training office of the headquarters and distributed by plane, so that the people in the bandit area will not be deceived by the bandits), "Our strength in southern Jiangxi is too thin, and the main bandit army does not come, so there is no way to win", "After the fourth encirclement and suppression was broken, there was a fifth, and in the future there will be a sixth, seventh, and eighth encirclement and suppression, and I don't know when it will end."</p>
<p>The attitude of the people in the bandit areas towards the bandits: 1. In Huichang Xunwu Anyuan, several divisions have expanded the bandit army into a group of terror, 2. Every time a mass meeting is convened, no masses come because they are afraid of becoming bandits, 3. The people in some places have organized broadsword associations to confront or disturb a certain area of the bandits. (November 7, Datong Society)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Ping Sui Railway: Debt Dispute - Railway Bureau Cancels Interest for Creditors, Creditor Group Holds Meeting to Discuss Debt Recovery <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Ping Sui Railway was built with employee investments. Now, the railway bureau, under the pretext of streamlining debt, has cancelled interest payments for creditors holding 1,000 yuan in debt, proposing to repay the principal in 100 months, with monthly installments of 10 yuan and cessation of interest. Accrued interest will not be paid. Consequently, employees have organized the Ping Sui Railway Bureau Short-Term Loan Creditor Group to demand debt repayment from the railway bureau. Today (the 4th), an emergency meeting was convened at 4:00 PM, deciding to first send representatives to petition the authorities and to contact various parties for assistance. Regarding the details of the loan, Creditor Group members Yang Weiru and Wu Zhenchen stated that China and Russia began trading very early, with the trade occurring at Boketu, north of Kulun, commonly called the "Trading City." The trade route ran from Beijing, exiting Juyongguan, passing through Zhangjiakou, and entering Inner and Outer Mongolia to reach Kulun. This was formerly the only land trade route. In particular, the Juyongguan pass, which cuts through the Taihang Mountains, is known worldwide as a natural fortress. This road is exceptionally important for national defense and commerce, thus attracting the attention of major powers. During the late Qing Dynasty, in the Guangxu era, when foreign powers were most aggressively invading China, they each divided China's hinterland into spheres of influence. The Russians designated the area from Beijing to the north, specifying that if China were to build a railway along this route in the future, it must use Russian loans and be constructed by the Russians. They urged its early construction, threatening to plan it on our behalf if we delayed. China, in order to maintain its sovereignty, reluctantly decided to build it itself. At that time, the patriotic engineer from Guangdong, Zhan Tianyou, was appointed as the chief engineer. Coincidentally, the Jing Feng Railway was experiencing prosperous business, with annual surplus remaining after repaying British loan principal and interest. This surplus was allocated to the Jing Zhang Railway as construction funds. From then on, the plan for the Jing Zhang Railway to be built purely with Chinese people and Chinese funds was set. The Jing Zhang Railway officially commenced construction in the 31st year of Guangxu and was completed in the 34th year. Construction costs were entirely allocated from the Jing Feng Railway surplus. After completion, in the first year of Xuantong, it was proposed to extend the line to Suiyuan, named the Zhang Sui Extension. Construction costs continued to be allocated from the Jing Feng surplus. By the autumn of the 3rd year of Xuantong, only the engineering train reached Yanggao County in Shanxi. The Wuchang Uprising occurred, causing major political changes, and the project was halted. At the same time, the construction funds for this line also ran aground due to various other factors. At that time, the section of the extension project from Tianzhen to Yanggao was still largely incomplete. From Yanggao to Datong, there were only a few sections of earthen road. In the 1st and 2nd years of the Republic, the political situation stabilized slightly, and plans were made to complete the Datong section first. Because funds were unavailable and it was inconvenient to borrow foreign capital, the railway staff devised a method to maintain the railway. The bureau director and chief engineer initiated the issuance of short-term loan bonds of 1,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan each, with a term of one year or one and a half years, a monthly interest rate of 7.5%, interest paid quarterly, and principal repaid upon maturity. Staff were encouraged to subscribe with their salary savings, raising 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to maintain the railway project. This fundraising served as the underlying fund for the project, while the operating revenue of the Jing Zhang section was used for revolving capital. The Ministry of Communications provided a guarantee for the repayment of principal and interest on this loan, and the purpose of the loan was listed on the back of the loan bond to ensure transparency. This was the general situation regarding the initiation of short-term loan bonds at that time. After the Datong section opened to traffic in the 3rd year of the Republic, the line was extended to the Tongfeng section. In the 5th year of the Republic, the Datong Kouquan branch line was built. In the 7th year of the Republic, the line was extended to the Fengsu section. In the 9th year of the Republic, the line was extended to the Ping Sui section. In the 11th year of the Republic, the line was extended to the Sui Bao section, gradually completing the entire Jing Sui Railway, reaching Baotou, totaling more than 1,600 li. This was largely thanks to the annual revolving fundraising of these short-term loan bonds. After the 5th and 6th years of the Republic, this method of borrowing gradually gained credibility, and subscribers included not only railway staff but also many people outside the railway. The total amount borrowed also gradually increased. Between the 10th and 11th years of the Republic, the railway bureau purchased too many locomotives and vehicles, and new project expenditures were also significant. Due to the political situation, the central government's finances were tight, and for other various reasons, the railway bureau's situation deteriorated daily, with finances in dire straits. Loans were obtained from banks at a monthly interest rate of 1.7% to 1.8%, requiring the designation of revenue from various stations as collateral, along with other various conditions, before they could be established. At that time, many of these short-term loan bonds had matured and needed to be repaid, but the railway bureau was not only unable to repay them but also believed that this method of borrowing had benefited the railway bureau for a long time. There were no kickbacks, no collateral, and it was purely a direct credit relationship with depositors. As long as credit was maintained and payments were handled properly, it was much cheaper than relying on the whims of bankers. Therefore, the railway bureau automatically changed the interest rate to 1.5% and converted the matured loan bonds into extended loan bonds. Later, when the extended term expired, it was changed to being able to be withdrawn at any time. The railway bureau's repeated automatic changes to the method were all to alleviate the distress of depositors due to its own economic deficiencies and to avoid the embarrassment of withdrawals, as well as to leave room for maneuver for the future.

<h3 id="e99">Highways in Southern Anhui Counties, Huainan-Wuhu Railway Also Planned for Construction <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The highways in this province, as stipulated by the Seven-Province Highway Conference for the construction of trunk and branch lines, are all under active design, aiming to complete construction within the second deadline at the end of this year. In southern Anhui, in addition to the Xiuxian-Shexian line, which has long been completed and open to traffic, the Huizhou-Hangzhou Road will also be completed within the month. The Jingdezhen-Qimen-Tunxi-Chun'an and Wuhu-Tunxi-Wuyuan-Dexing lines are either raising funds for construction or are already under survey and construction. Because they are related to transportation in seven provinces, a summary is presented as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Jing Qimen Line <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Qimen borders Chunliang in Jiangxi, serving as an important route for travel between Jiangxi and Anhui. Mail from Jingdezhen is transferred through Qimen to various places, as Qimen is connected to various counties in southern Anhui. Therefore, the Qimen-Jingdezhen line holds the throat of land transportation between Anhui and Jiangxi. The Anhui Construction Department previously approved a letter from the Jiangxi Highway Department urging the dispatch of personnel to conduct a detailed survey of the road in order to discuss and decide. Now, the Anhui Highway Bureau has commissioned engineer Xu Chuanjing to conduct a survey to Chunliang, and to discuss the method of starting construction with the Jiangxi side in Jingdezhen.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Wuhu Tunxi Road <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The earthwork on the Jixi section, which is the most difficult part of the road to construct, has recently been completed by 80%. However, the stone bridges and culverts still need additional labor to rush construction. The northern section starts from Wuhu. From Dawang Village to Wuhu, there is no roadbed. The Construction Department has ordered the Highway Bureau to remeasure a new line and carry out filling and construction as soon as possible. Preparations are also being made to expand the site at the junction with the Huizhou-Hangzhou Road for the use of vehicle transfer. The originally planned traffic route for this road will be changed because the construction of the Jingjian Road (Capital to Jianping) project is under active construction, and the route will be extended through Jixi to Tunxi. The route from Beijing to Anhui can be transferred from the Jingwu Road to the Jingjian Road to Tunxi. It is expected to be completed and open to traffic by the end of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Tunxi Chun'an Line <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Starting from Tunxi and reaching Chun'an in Zhejiang, it is connected to the Wuhu-Tunxi Road, serving as an important route for transportation between Anhui and Zhejiang. In order to complete the highway plan, the Anhui Construction Department commissioned Ding Maiman as the chief engineer to survey the road. Recently, he led a team to survey and complete the project. The total construction cost is estimated to be more than 500,000 yuan. As the road is related to transportation between Anhui and Zhejiang, active fundraising is underway to start construction as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Wuyuan Dexing Line <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>This route runs from the county seat of Wuyuan to the Baisha Pass in Dexing, Jiangxi, where it connects to the Huabu-Dangshan highway, serving as an important route for Wuyuan and the counties under Raozhou to enter Shanghai and Hangzhou. Initially, the county had planned to repair it itself, but it was abandoned due to insufficient fundraising. Recently, the Huining Association of Wuyuan, which is based in Shanghai, repeatedly telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to build a motor road due to the obstructed transportation in Wuyuan. The Construction Department believes that this road is very important for commerce and that there is a need for repair. It should be listed as a county road, with the local government raising funds and attracting merchants to build it. Orders have been given to the county government to engage in fundraising. When this road is completed, the transportation of goods between Raozhou and Wuyuan will all enter and exit through this road, which is more convenient than shipping through Poyang Lake, Xunyang, and Tunxi.</p>
<p>The Central Construction Committee recently has a plan to lay a light railway from Luhezhen in Huainan, this province, to Wuhu. Chief Technician Chen Maojie and Technician Shi Weixin were dispatched to Wuhu to survey the area around Chaohu last month. It is also heard that the light railway from Luhezhen to Hefei can be built by the end of this year. The reason is that Huainan in this province has extremely rich coal reserves. According to expert statistics, there are more than 240 million tons, enough for a century of mining. However, transportation from the mining area (Luhezhen in northern Anhui) to Wuhu is inconvenient, and even if mining is possible, transportation is not easy. Therefore, the Construction Committee has a proposal to lay a railway. (5th)</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the fifth annual meeting of the National People's Electricity Association concluded on the 5th, the Changsha Electric Light Company of Hunan specially welcomed the representatives and invited them to visit. The association elected more than 20 representatives. That evening, they departed on the special express train to Hunan-Hubei, arriving in Changsha at 8:00 AM on the 6th. They first went to the Xianghan Hotel for rest. In the afternoon, they visited the north and south power plants, accompanied by engineers Yang Botao and Yi Dingxin, and were quite satisfied. They then toured Tianxin Pavilion for photography, and accompanied by the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, visited the Hunan Orphanage National Products Exhibition Hall in Juicaigarden. In the evening, the Hunan Power Plant hosted a banquet for the representatives at the Guan Yue Temple, and invited Director of Construction Department Yu Jiechuan, Changsha Mayor He Wenyuan, and Public Security Bureau Chief Li Qiong to accompany them. During the banquet, Xiao Enzhen, chairman of the company, delivered a welcome speech. Chairman Li was elected by the representatives to give a reply. After the banquet, they went to the Xiang Theater to watch a play.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, the representatives crossed the Xiang River to visit the scenic spots of Yuelu Mountain, paid homage to the tombs of revolutionary martyrs Huang Kecheng and Cai Songpo. At noon, Hunan University hosted a banquet, and President Hu Shuhua delivered a welcome speech, saying that he was honored to have the guests travel far to visit. The gathering today is different from ordinary events because many graduates of the Electrical Engineering Department of the College of Engineering of the university are serving in the electric plants of the guests. The future graduates still need the guidance of the guests to meet the environment of both sides and promote the benefit of both parties. Therefore, the relationship between the association and the school can be said to be extremely close. The steel industry is the key to saving the country. He is preparing to submit a preliminary plan for the Zhuzhou Steel Plant to the government. Both steel and electricity are pioneers in developing the industry, and there is a possibility of cooperation between them. He asked the guests to point out the problems in his books. The university's location is the original site of Yuelu Academy. The sages who studied hard and became talents here were replaced by people of generations. The students can still abide by the ancient training, study hard, and the school style is simple. This can be said to be gratifying to the guests. Please take a glass, wishing the Electricity Association a long life and the guests a healthy journey. Then Li Yan gave a reply, saying that the university's excellent style is known to colleagues, and President Hu is an engineering expert. The students' grades should be very good. The association is focusing on concentrating talents in view of the importance of the engineering departments of the members, and hopes that the Electrical Engineering Department will create practical talents to meet the needs of the electricity industry. In the future, it is hoped that the education sector and the electricity industry will cooperate with each other for the benefit of both parties. Then the guests visited the library which was completed on the previous day. Hunan Power Plant only had to cancel the planned tour of Hengshan because the representatives had to return to Wuhan on the evening of the day. At 4:00 PM, a farewell banquet was held at Wanlichun Western Restaurant. The guests and hosts gave speeches during the banquet. After the banquet, the representatives boarded the train and returned to Wuhan. The representatives will give speeches at Wuhan University on the 9th and visit the scenic spots of Luojia Mountain, and then they will return to their respective homes. (8th)</p>

<p>Feng Heqing, who runs a carpentry shop in Daxu Lane in the Fourth District, is already 80 years old. His beard and hair are like silk, but he is mentally and physically strong, showing no signs of aging. He has married seven wives in his lifetime, and his eighth wife also passed away in August of this year. Feng, feeling lonely in his old age and unaccustomed to being a widower, recently married a widow surnamed Wang from the northern mountains as his successor, through the mediation of his relative Gu. The marriage was officially consummated on the 6th of this month. For a time, people near and far were talking about it.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Mediation Fails in Huisheng Debt Case <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xi Huian, the owner of the Huisheng Silk Factory in Huigong Bridge, fled to Shanghai after owing more than 60,000 yuan. The County Chamber of Commerce is handling the liquidation on his behalf and is in contact with Magistrate Yan. First, 952 dan of dry cocoons piled up in various warehouses of the factory were sealed by official Ji Songzhen, accompanied by Fan Xinzhi, the director of the Second Branch Bureau, on the 7th of this month. It is learned that yesterday afternoon (8th) at 2:00 PM, the Chamber of Commerce invited more than 60 representatives from relevant banks, money houses, silk cocoon warehouses, and individual dry cocoon households to discuss the settlement of the individual dry cocoon household portion. Qian Sunqing served as the temporary chairman, reporting on the process of mediating the debts of the Huisheng Silk Factory. Next, representatives of the individual dry cocoon households demanded the payment of more than 35,000 yuan and requested that bankers lend cash to be distributed equally. However, representatives of the bankers refused to lend money because the dry cocoons had been mortgaged by Xi Huian for approximately 80,000 yuan. After deducting interest, warehouse rent, insurance, and other expenses, there was little left. After a long discussion, the two sides insisted on their own opinions, resulting in no way to resolve the issue. Finally, at the request of Chairman Qian, the bankers offered 30% cash to compensate the individual dry cocoon households. The bankers only agreed to 25%, totaling more than 9,600 yuan, to be distributed first. The representatives of the individual dry cocoon households found the amount too far apart and difficult to cope with the villagers, so the matter remained unresolved. In recent days, villagers have been sitting and demanding payment from the individual dry cocoon households, with as many as 30 or 40 people at each house. As a result, disputes have arisen repeatedly. The wife of the owner of the Changchang Cocoon Firm in Zhanggaozhuang in the 16th District, surnamed Mou, was driven to desperation and committed suicide by hanging herself the day before yesterday. Fortunately, she was discovered and saved, and no fatal case occurred. Furthermore, silk cocoon merchant Wu Shirong fraudulently received more than 100 dan of dry cocoons of the Xi family from the Yixin Cocoon Warehouse. This was discovered by the individual dry cocoon households, which led to another negotiation.</p>

Witness Wang Liu ran to report to the Lin Branch Precinct. The township head, Shen Zhonglu, also reported to the District Office. The District Office, because the case involved human life, immediately reported to the county government, requesting that personnel be dispatched for inspection.

A Shaoxing boat sped by. They ordered the boat to stop for inspection, but the boat did not respond. Suspecting it was a bandit boat, they strenuously pursued it and fired two shots, inadvertently hitting Huang Weijin in a vital area. He fell into the river and died instantly. The next day, the deceased's son, Huang Zikun, went to the river where the incident happened to recover the body. The militiamen detained him, took him back to the team, searched his home, deemed Huang Zikun's behavior improper, and sent him to court for interrogation. After the case occurred, Prosecutor Tong Xianzhi believed that the militiamen were suspected of manslaughter. Yesterday, he summoned both parties for interrogation again.

<h3 id="e121">All American Wheat to be Transported by China Merchants Bureau - Delegation to American Company, Fraser &amp; Uruguhart - First Batch of American Wheat Starts Shipping to Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to the transportation issues, the purchased American wheat resulted in significant disputes. It wasn't until yesterday that they were finally decided. China Merchants Bureau will rent ships to America. However, the American company, Fraser &amp; Uruguhart, is commissioned by China Merchants Bureau, and will handle the rental of ships and the carrying of passengers and goods. A contract has been signed. The following is the history of this matter:</p>
<h3 id="e122">Fraser &amp; Uruguhart Undertakes Cotton and Wheat Loading <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>This time, China has ordered a large batch of American relief cotton and wheat, the amount is very large. All loading will require at least 200 ships. If transported in rotation, it will require at least 200 transports to complete. Last year, the American company, Fraser &amp; Uruguhart, previously represented the Central Government in transporting more than 300,000 tons of relief wheat, charging a very small amount of freight, almost entirely as a volunteer. This year, the cotton and wheat was delivered by this company. As the companies charged excessive freight, only Fraser charged low fees. And because last time the company was helpful with the wheat delivery, the American side allowed the cotton and wheat to be loaded by this company. The contract has been signed. All import procedures have been negotiated. The American cotton has already arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Changes Mid Way <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Before the American wheat was ready to be loaded, the Central Government disagreed on this matter. The reason is, the American wheat was purchased by the government, therefore the government should be the one transporting and loading. Why was this delegated to a foreign company? China Merchants Bureau is a national shipping company, and therefore can handle this matter. The Fraser contract was already signed, therefore problems resulted. However, Fraser had already contacted several American shipping companies.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Difficulty of Shipping Goods <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) can take over and charter ships to load wheat, if empty ships go to the United States to transport wheat to Shanghai without loading any goods for the return trip, the shipping costs will be huge and the freight rates will be high, making it more expensive than Fook Lai's (福來) freight rates. Moreover, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company does not have branches in the United States and is unfamiliar with the local conditions, making it difficult to compare with Fook Lai. Therefore, after discussions, the Cotton and Wheat Transportation Office also believes that it cannot entrust the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be solely responsible for transportation. After a long period of discussion, a compromise was finally reached.</p>
<h3 id="e125">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Responsible for Handling <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>As a result of the agreement, all matters related to wheat transportation will be handled by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, the procedures for chartering ships and the transportation of export goods from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Luzon (小呂宋) when the wheat ships arrive in Shanghai, unload their cargo, and return to the United States will be handled by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fook Lai jointly. All matters related to the delivery and unloading of goods in the United States will be handled by Fook Lai. In this way, empty ships going to the United States can be avoided, and freight costs can also be reduced. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fook Lai have been meeting for several days to discuss this matter, and it was resolved yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Both Parties Sign a Contract <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the joint transportation of American wheat, the contract between China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fook Lai has been agreed upon and signed by both parties. Fook Lai will be responsible for chartering ships in the United States to transport wheat. After the ships arrive in Shanghai, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be responsible for unloading and storing the wheat. Both parties will work together to solicit the transportation of American goods for the return trip. All authority will be vested in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Fook Lai will only act as a broker, extracting a minimal commission. After signing this contract, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send personnel to Fook Lai to discuss wheat transportation and other matters.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The First Shipment is Scheduled <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat was originally scheduled to be loaded onto ships early on, but it was delayed for many days due to the aforementioned issue. Now that this matter has been resolved, the first batch of American wheat can be shipped from Portland, USA, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in about twenty-three or four days. Therefore, it can be imported at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, and will be completely unloaded at the China Warehouse (華棧) and Yangzi Wharf (揚子碼頭). In the future, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send ships to transport the wheat to other ports.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Second and Third Batches of Cotton are Coming <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The second batch of American cotton, which is being transported by Fook Lai's ships, has been confirmed to have departed from New Orleans and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around December 10th. It will also be stored in the China Warehouse. The third batch of American cotton was shipped about ten days later than the second batch and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd or 23rd of next month. According to reliable information obtained by reporters, two batches of American cotton, totaling about 30,000 bales, will arrive in Shanghai every month from next month onwards.</p>

As for the joint transportation pier, it has been changed to Laoyao because Dapu (大埔) has been silted up in recent years, and a 1,000-ton seagoing vessel can only load 400-500 tons of coal each time and is prone to running aground. As a result, a lot of cargo on the Longhai Railway is stored in the Dapu warehouse. Now, the Laoyao pier can accommodate 3,000-ton seagoing vessels, which is more convenient. As for the Dapu pier, it will not be abandoned because the Longhai Railway handles about 30,000 tons of cargo per month, and Dapu is a center for salt. Therefore, companies such as Da Zhen Hezhong (大振合衆) will not be unable to operate due to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's handling of water-land joint transportation.</p>

Liu stated that he has no mission in Japan and it is entirely a private trip. He used to work at the embassy in Japan 15 years ago and has not been to Japan for many years, so he is going for a visit. Going to the United States is also a sightseeing trip, with a stay of about ten days before going to Germany to take office. China had a full-time ambassador to Austria ten years ago, but recently it has been concurrently held by the ambassador to Germany.

French Envoy Wilden, French Consul General Meleia and the commanders of the army and navy went to the dock to greet them. A reporter went to the French Consulate General yesterday to pay his respects to Bira and asked for his opinion on the future political relations between the countries of the Far East. He said that the Sino-Japanese relationship will improve and although the Russo-Japanese relationship is tense, he does not believe there will be a worrying situation because he believes Japan is always very clever politically and always chooses the best path. He also said that he is very interested in Far Eastern affairs and will re-examine Japan's industrialization after arriving in Tokyo. Bira had previously written a book on Japan's industrial situation when he was in Japan, so he will continue his research. Bira is traveling with his wife. He is said to be leaving for Japan within this week. Counselor Huo Benno, who was previously a counselor at the Swiss Embassy, will go to Peiping (北平) to take over and will soon be in charge of the embassy's affairs after Envoy Wilden takes leave and returns to his country.</p>

<h3 id="e138">After the Death of French Prime Minister Ban Le Wei, Ye Gongchuo Expressed Deep Sorrow. Ban Made Many Contributions to China During His Lifetime. It Can Be Said That China Has Lost a Good International Friend. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The recent death of former French Prime Minister Ban Le Wei has caused grief throughout France, both in the government and among the people. Ban was a great scholar of his generation and admired by countries all over the world. The news of his death was met with universal grief. Ye Gongchuo, the former Minister of Railways of China, had a close personal relationship with Ban. He was hired as a senior special advisor to the Ministry of Communications during the Beijing government era. When the news of Ban's death reached Shanghai, Ye was deeply saddened. A reporter from the French-language Shanghai Daily recently visited Ye to inquire about various matters. Ye repeatedly expressed his condolences. The newspaper described it in detail on November 2nd. "The death of former French Prime Minister Ban Le Wei is not only a loss of a great scholar and intelligent politician for France, causing deep grief to all French people, but also a loss of a good international friend for China, which is far away from France." These were the words spoken to us yesterday morning by Ye Gongchuo, the former Director-General of Communications and Minister of Railways of China. Ye was one of Ban Le Wei's Chinese friends, who was a French former prime minister, a scientist and a great politician. Now that he has heard of the death of his old friend,</p>
<h3 id="e139">He Was Overwhelmed With Grief <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Ye continued to praise, "Mr. Ban was a very good friend to China and helped China deeply." This great Chinese politician then recounted to us the history of his past cooperation with the great French scholar, saying, "Mr. Ban came to China in 1920 at my invitation as a senior special advisor to the Ministry of Communications. Recalling Mr. Ban's contributions to our country during his time at the Ministry of Communications, I am deeply saddened by his sudden death, and so are the people of the country." "He was not only a great scholar of his generation and a talented politician, but also a kind-</p>

<p>Friend, a colleague of excellent character and learning, a resourceful and visionary person, and a gentleman with impeccable manners." Ye also recounted many anecdotes about Ban that are unknown to the world, "When Mr. Ban and I were working together in Beiping (Beijing), he broke his arm, but he still wore a bandage and worked as usual. I saw that he was in great pain and tried to persuade him to rest, but he refused. In desperation, I recommended a maid who knew French and forced him to accept her services. "The last time I went to France, I visited him in a</p>

<p>His residence was part of a floor in an apartment building, and the furnishings were simple. The most valuable items in the room were his disorganized books. He was extremely frugal in his personal life, but extremely brave in his work. Therefore, I always lamented that his integrity was unattainable." Ye then pointed to a Chinese-style folding fan from the Louis XIV era and told us, "This is a souvenir given to me by my dear friend Mr. Ban. I still treasure it,</p>
<h3 id="e142">Seeing the Object Brings Back Memories <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>It really makes me recall the time when I was with this great Mr. Ban." Mr. Ye Gongchuo also asked the French-language "Shanghai Daily" to convey his condolences and those of his colleagues to the family of this great scholar in France, because Ban was a "Friend of China." Now that he has suddenly passed away, not only are the French deeply saddened, but all of Ban's Chinese friends also express their deepest sympathy.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Lin Fusheng, a Young Chinese Aviator Studying in Germany, Will Fly Back to China. He Was Sent by the Central Government to Study Military Aviation in Germany. He Once Crashed Near Berlin. He Graduated Last Month and Plans to Follow Sun Tonggang's Heroic Feat. <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>German aviation technology has always been highly respected in the world. The Chinese government has sent personnel to Germany to study aviation, and there are quite a few of them. Since Mr. Sun Tonggang flew back to China from Germany, he has been admired by the people of the country. Now there is also Mr. Lin Fusheng, who has graduated from aviation studies in Germany and plans to follow up with a long-distance flight back to the country. A reporter from the Min Yan (民言) News Agency learned the details from Mr. Lu, a friend of Mr. Lin, in Shanghai yesterday, and is urgently reporting it as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Studying Aviation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Fusheng is a native of Minhou, Fujian, and is 27 years old. In 1929, he graduated from the Central Military and Political School. After being selected and retained for study abroad by the school, he went to Germany to study aviation on May 28, 1930. The school Mr. Lin attended was the German Aviation School, located in Braunschweig (勃郎威克) in Hanover (漢諾堡) near Berlin, the German capital.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Lin Fusheng, a Young Chinese Aviator Studying in Germany <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin's main subjects of study were various military technologies on land and water, and he also studied aircraft machinery manufacturing. He graduated in three years. Mr. Lin first studied land-based flying in Germany, then water-based flying, and finally combined land and water practice. According to recent observations by German military aviators, land and water aircraft are very important for future coastal defense and air combat. Because of his study of amphibious flight, Mr. Lin often flew between the north and south of Germany, because northern Germany is suitable for water-based flight.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Once in Danger <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>On February 9 last year, Mr. Lin was practicing airplane rotation and ascending and descending in a Dr 499 aircraft near Berlin. The plane crashed and was completely destroyed, but Mr. Lin only injured his jaw and teeth. He was hospitalized for eight weeks, and for seven weeks he only drank and did not eat, but his spirit and physical strength were able to remain as before. At that time, the January 28th Incident (淞滬抗日戰事) broke out, and Japanese aircraft arbitrarily bombed. Mr. Lin was extremely angry and indignant upon hearing the news in the hospital. He wrote to a friend, saying that the minor injury did not kill him, and that he had kept this body to resist Japan and save the country. Mr. Lin's ambition can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Mr. Lin Once Crashed and Was Rescued <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Lin graduated in October of this year. Before graduating, he often flew between the north and south of Germany and various countries in Europe, including Spain, to practice long-distance flying. In order to promote aviation to save the country, Mr. Lin plans to follow Sun Tonggang and purchase an aircraft in the near future to make a long-distance flight from Europe to Asia to return to China. He is currently applying for approval from Chairman Chiang, Zhang Zhizhong, the Dean of Education of the Central Military Academy, and the Training Supervision Department.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Cotton Cloth Exchange Opened as Usual Yesterday Morning. The Ministry of Industry Sent Liu Fuyin to Shanghai to Mediate. All Parties Have Understood and Resumed Business as Usual. <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange was ordered by the Ministry of Industry, at the request of the Cotton Industry Control Association, to refuse customers to hand over newly produced yarn from November to the end of December, causing a three-day disruption. Zhou Bingwen, the Standing Committee Member of the Cotton Industry Control Association, and Mu Ouchu, the Chairman of the Exchange, went to Beijing to discuss everything with the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry immediately sent Liu Fuyin, the Director of the Department of Agriculture, and Zhou to Shanghai to mediate. The day before yesterday afternoon, they convened a meeting of important figures from yarn manufacturers and Mu Ouchu, the Chairman of the Exchange. After careful discussion by both parties, the result was very satisfactory, and the Exchange convened a temporary board of directors meeting at 4 PM on the same afternoon. At the same time, the Brokers Association also convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon to report everything. They separately obtained the consent of the members and decided to open as usual yesterday. A disturbance has come to an end. A reporter from the Xin Xin (新新) News Agency went to the Exchange yesterday morning and learned that the cotton yarn market has recovered. However, the external clearance of the alternative method, that is, the so-called exchange of new yarn for old yarn, is still not fully understood. The reporter inquired with the Brokers Association, which stated that the so-called alternative method, such as refusing to accept new yarn delivered by customers in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Industry when cotton yarn is auctioned, and then having the Cotton Industry Control Association exchange this new yarn for stored yarn, is probably not as simple as that. It is best to hope that the Ministry of Industry can withdraw its order and develop a proper method to take into account the interests of both parties.</p>

The Ministry of Industry Plans to Grant Monopoly Rights to National Matches. <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, foreign matches have been dumping goods in China at depreciated prices, becoming more and more serious. As a result, national matches have been excluded and are in danger of collapse. A reporter from the Ri Ri (日日) News Agency specially visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office yesterday and asked for countermeasures. It is said that this matter is not a local issue, but the entire issue of our country's industrial sector. It is necessary to plan from the root cause and solve the problem fundamentally. It is not beneficial to the country and the people to try to save only one type of match. As for the temporary solution, it should be handled by the Foreign Goods Dumping Review Committee, which will determine the collection of match dumping taxes based on the facts. In addition, according to an official from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry has long been aware of the dumping of foreign matches and has drafted a national match monopoly, which is the government's initial step to save national matches. It must be decided by the central government whether the monopoly issue is feasible. The current relief method is to levy a match dumping tax, which is enough to counter the dumping.</p>

<p>The Pudong branch project of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is expected to be completed by the end of this month and is scheduled to open at the beginning of next month. The Telephone Bureau has announced that those who need to install telephones in the area should register as soon as possible so that lines can be allocated. The Bureau's previous desire to expand telephone lines has already led to a contract with the China Automatic Telephone Company, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai in January next year. Once the expansion is completed, all cross-border telephones will be removed. The new downtown bureau is scheduled to open for bidding in Beijing on the 20th of this month, with completion limited to the end of the year. The details of each item are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Pudong Branch <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>It has been three months since the Telephone Bureau's Pudong branch began installing equipment in August. Due to the time it took to repair the 800-line common-battery switchboard brought by the Ministry of Communications, the originally scheduled opening at the end of October has been postponed to the end of November. The machines can be installed and replaced, and the official opening is scheduled for early December. The Telephone Bureau purchased the cross-river water lines from the Telephone Company. Although they have now been taken over by the Telephone Bureau, the official price will be paid and managed after all projects are completed and proven undamaged by the end of this month. The Telephone Bureau also notified residents in the area who need to install telephones to send a letter to the General Bureau for registration within this month so that lines can be allocated. (The original text is very long, omitted)</p>

<p>As for the location of the new bureau in the downtown area, it is originally at the east end of Sanmin Road, with five acres of land. According to Liu Shoujing, director of the document stock of the Telephone Bureau, told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter that the Telephone Bureau only has various agencies affiliated with the municipal government in the downtown area at the moment, so they will first build a two-story Western-style building, covering one acre of land, and then expand after the market prospers. The new bureau's drawings were drafted by architects Lu Qianshou and Wu Jingqi. Letters have now been sent to various construction companies, a total of twenty letters, with a limited price of 20,000 yuan, stipulating that the house must be delivered within six months at the latest. The bidding is scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Communications on the 20th of this month. If it cannot be completed on schedule, the engineering section has already drafted a plan to transfer the 300 automatic machines from Jiangwan to Pudong for use in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Since the Telephone Bureau began dismantling cross-border telephones in September in accordance with the temporary telephone contract, more than 20 applications for dismantling have been received. The Bureau originally wanted to dismantle them earlier, but because the "0" switchboard urgently needs to be supplemented, it was decided to dismantle and install them continuously. The Materials Purchasing Committee of the Ministry of Communications has ordered 50 pairs of telephone lines from the China Automatic Telephone Company at a price of 100,000 yuan. The contract was signed the day before yesterday and is scheduled for delivery in January next year. After the expansion of the lines, all cross-border telephones will be dismantled at the same time. As for the renovation of the Longhua Bureau's automatic machines, it has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and bidding has now begun, which can also be completed by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The cotton and rice planted in the farmland of various districts in Shanghai County have suffered severe losses from two hurricanes. After receiving the report, the county government sent personnel to investigate and reported to the provincial department for relief. The finance, civil affairs, and construction departments have each sent committee members Li Lingniu and Huang Meixian to the county for a re-examination.

<h3 id="e165">New Development in the Future of China's Cooperative Construction; General Office Established in Shanghai; Office Established in Wuxi <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the national cooperative business was handled by the government authorities, and a cooperative association was established to specialize in guiding the cooperative organization. However, no private individuals invested in the national cooperative construction movement. For several years, due to the lack of relevant cooperative knowledge among the people, the results often tended to be unsuccessful. Although the authorities tried their best to find ways to hire experts to study, the key was that theory could not be effective. Now, cooperative experts Li Haochun and Li Yinbei brothers, known for their enthusiasm for social undertakings and cooperative construction movements, based on their years of practical research on rural cooperative construction, have invested their own funds to establish the China United Society. Its purpose is entirely to assist the government in completing China's cooperative construction undertaking, hoping to achieve the true mission of revitalizing the countryside. Therefore, it is completely different from other enterprises. In the vertical aspect, it is necessary to complete the three types of cooperative construction movements: consumption, production, and credit. In the horizontal aspect, it is necessary to complete the five types of vocational cooperative construction movements: education, agriculture, industry, commerce, and military affairs. Every cooperative movement starts with educational cooperation. Because the position of the education sector is the technician for manufacturing the future citizens and the mentor for the general adults in today's society, the education sector cooperates first, and other sectors rely on each other as examples. The spirit of inducing the cooperative construction movement is more important than any other sector. At present, the society has united 56 production cooperatives, 104 consumer cooperatives, and 35 credit cooperatives. It has promoted 34 production cooperatives, 68 consumer cooperatives, and 15 credit cooperatives. The number of members has reached 50,000, and the society's address covers counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line. It is hoped that the government authorities can pay attention to it, and that cooperative families, entrepreneurs, and journalists across the country can provide practical assistance. Now, in order to promote the cooperative movement in 25 counties in southern Jiangsu, including Shanghai, Jiading, Taicang, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jinshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Changshu, Yixing, Wujiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Danyang, Jintan, Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, and Liyang, we are particularly seeking 100 educational cooperative promoters in each county. Anyone who is employed in the education sector or is familiar with the situation in the education sector and has quick handling skills, a healthy physique, a spirit of endurance, and organizational perseverance can write a self-recommendation letter and send it directly to the Wuxi City Central Elementary School Second Branch, China United Society Office in Xixu, stating their wishes. If they are suitable, they will be invited by letter. If they are not suitable, they will not be replied. The society has also compiled a book on the six-week practical cooperative movement process, welcoming cooperative comrades to send letters to request it. The correspondence address is temporarily set at No. 25 Gaofu Lane, Baoshan Road, Shanghai Joint Manufacturing Society, Wuxi City Central Elementary School China United Society Office in Xixu.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Fourth Day of Bandit Suppression Campaign Publicity Week; More Than 60 Merchant Groups Attended <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city previously received an order from the Municipal Party Department to convene various merchant groups at 2:00 pm yesterday to hold a Shanghai Municipal Business Community Bandit Suppression Propaganda Campaign Meeting. More than 60 people attended, including Wang Xiaolai and Zheng Chengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, Fu Keming of the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association, Xu Guanqun of the Cosmetics Industry Association, Yuan Hongjun of the Leather Nail and Last Industry Association, Sun Binnan of the Flour Mill Industry Association, and Zhang Hongsun of the Silk and Satin Industry Association. After performing the ceremony, Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported, roughly saying, "Xiaolai, in the position of chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, represents the business community and offers some opinions. The significance of today's meeting lies in the word 'bandit'. We are already very afraid when we hear the word 'bandit', let alone adding the word 'red'. This word 'red' contains international relations, and its interest relationship is related to the entire country, so it is ten times or a hundred times more harmful than ordinary bandits. However, the people's demand is to live and work in peace and contentment. How can they live and work in peace and contentment with bandits? Therefore, bandits and the people are incompatible. I have seen in the newspapers that it will take three years to eliminate the Red Bandits, which shows that the bandits' arrogance has been very rampant. However, I am afraid that an international war will break out during these three years. At that time, what can we, the people, imagine if we are harmed in both ways? Therefore, we are holding this meeting today to unite all the compatriots in the country to mobilize and eliminate the Red Bandits, and then prepare to deal with the international war." Then, Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, gave a speech (omitted), and finally shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Qiongzhou Native Sugar Fined Case; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry to Send Personnel for Inspection <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Qiongzhou native sugar being transported to Shanghai and detained and fined by the customs for allegedly mixing foreign sugar, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the complaints of Qiongzhou sugar merchants, has sent several telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and Industry, requesting to protect the national sugar and ordering the goods to be released. The details have been recorded in previous reports. However, several months have passed and there is still no solution. The sugar merchants are increasingly worried. It is now known that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Industry again, requesting to send personnel to Shanghai to jointly inspect the samples with the customs and the receiving firms and release them quickly. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing Ministry of Finance and Industry: This month, according to a letter from Xing Juefei, representative of the Qiongya sugar merchants and the Haikou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the native sugar transported to Shanghai by Lushou Wheel on July 24 by Haikou Jushenghao and handed over to Futianshenhang, a total of 205 packages, and the native sugar transported to Shanghai by Chongqing Wheel on August 2 by Houshenghao and handed over to Zhichengxinhang, 79 packages, the sugar was all purchased from Yazhou. When it arrived in Haikou, it was reported to the customs for inspection, confirming that it was native sugar. After paying the import tax on native goods and waiting for the wheel to be transported to Shanghai, it was also reported to the customs for inspection and paid tax in accordance with the regulations when it was exported from Haikou. The procedures were complete and the customs duties were fully paid. Unexpectedly, when the goods arrived in Shanghai, they were suddenly detained by the Jianghai Customs, accusing them of mixing foreign sugar and imposing a huge fine. If the fine was not paid, the goods would be confiscated. In this dangerous situation, the merchants could only appeal to the Central Ministry of Finance on the one hand and pay the fine with pain on the other, so as to avoid the goods being confiscated and auctioned off and it would be difficult to keep the physical evidence. It is now found that the native sugar of the two firms is still in Warehouse No. 14 of the Shanghai Taikoo Warehouse. Please allow us to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and send personnel to Shanghai, or transfer it to the Jianghai Customs Supervision, together with your association and Zhichengxing and Futianshenhang, to send personnel to the warehouse to extract and test the sugar samples, so that the distinction between the two can be made immediately, so as to avoid the Jianghai Customs Tax Department from calling a stag a horse and making the merchants wronged, etc., to the association. According to this, it was found that from April of this year, native sugar from Qiongya was transported to Shanghai and Xianggang ports and was accused by the customs of mixing foreign sugar. The punishment and confiscation occurred almost every month. The sugar merchants there felt that they were suffering from the difficulty of appealing. The native sugar transported to Shanghai by Jusheng and Housheng was already inspected by the Qionghai Customs Tax Department when it was transferred from Yaxian, confirming that it was native sugar, paid tax in accordance with the regulations and released. The association was recorded in the document submitted to your department on October 20 by the representative with No. 358. Now, the native sugar of the two firms is permanently stored in the Shanghai Taikoo Warehouse and there is no solution. As a last resort, it is planned to request your department to send personnel to Shanghai, together with the Jianghai Customs and the receiving firms, to extract samples and verify them, so as to distinguish the true situation. It is indeed a legitimate request to exhaust all efforts and cry out loudly. It is appropriate to report the situation by telegram. Please consider and approve the request, so as to avoid delays and the suffering of the Suzhou merchants. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yang.</p>

<p>The Relief Committee for the Yellow River Flood Disaster of the National Government is working to block the breaches in various ports through engineering offices in various districts. However, the project is huge, and the entire project plan must be carefully surveyed and designed. In addition to Song Xishang, chief engineer of the Work Relief Group, who went to Henan last month for capital investigation and guidance, Director Zhou Xiangxian also entered Beijing the night before last and transferred north yesterday morning. All 110,000 cotton clothes handled by the disaster relief group were also shipped out the day before yesterday. Regarding the method of implementing relief, in addition to setting up shelters and porridge factories in Shandong Province, Henan and Hebei provinces mostly changed to distributing relief grain. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Blocking the Breach Project <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>This time, the Yellow River breached a total of more than 50 large and small peaks north and south in Henan and Hebei provinces. After surveying by Xu Xinwu and others from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, a breach blocking plan and budget have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan. However, according to the person in charge of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow Disaster Association, all breach blocking projects are handled by the engineering offices under the group, and the water conservancy association's plan is only for reference. Its position is the same as that of the construction departments of Henan and Hebei provinces. The entire plan is now awaiting review by the group's special committee and then submitted to the Yellow Disaster Association for approval. For example, whether to build a stone dam at the Lanzhou old channel port has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Chief Engineer Song Xishang of the group has been in Lanzhou, Kaifeng and other places to guide the engineering office in carrying out its work since he went to Henan last month. It was recently telegraphed that a problem occurred in the breach blocking project at the 30th breach in Changyuan (the largest breach). Engineer Song went to inspect it yesterday (the day before yesterday) from Kaifeng. Director Zhou Xiangxian also left Shanghai for Beijing the night before last and transferred to Bian yesterday morning to inspect. It has not yet been telegraphed where he is now.</p>

<p>Du Yannian, the disaster relief commissioner of the Disaster Relief Group in Shandong Province, came to Shanghai to report on the disaster situation and returned to Lu with relief tickets and relief funds the day before yesterday. The establishment of shelters and porridge factories in various disaster-stricken counties has been decided separately.</p>

<p>The cotton clothes handled by the material collection and transportation section of the Disaster Relief Group were originally scheduled for 100,000 sets. Later, due to the vast disaster area and the large number of disaster victims, it was feared that it would not be enough to distribute, so 10,000 sets were specially added. The number of allocated sets was 48,000 sets in Shandong Province, 37,000 sets in Henan Province, and 25,000 sets in Hebei Province. In addition to the first two batches of 40,000 sets that were shipped out last month, the rest were all shipped out the day before yesterday to prepare for distribution to disaster victims to keep them warm.</p>

<p>The group's original relief method was mainly divided into emergency relief and the establishment of porridge factories and shelters. After the Henan Inspection and Release Office sent personnel to negotiate with local authorities and gentry in various disaster-stricken areas, they all agreed that setting up shelters was not easy to manage as it required a proper and large location, which would cause trouble. Therefore, it was decided to change to distributing relief grain and no longer set up factories and shelters. The situation in Hebei Province was also roughly the same.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Emergency Relief in Lanzhou <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the Disaster Relief Group reported by the Henan Inspection and Release Office that more than 100 villages in Leiji and other villages in Lanzhou County were severely affected by the disaster, and tens of thousands of disaster victims were waiting to be fed. The office was transferred to quickly release emergency relief for relief. The relief funds have been remitted to the Lanzhou County Party Department, the County Government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Finance Committee, and the Flood Relief Association for responsible custody. In order to regulate the local economy, relief rice will be purchased locally and released in separate routes. Local publicly recommended fair gentry will be the supervisors to ensure that the disaster victims receive actual benefits.</p>

There are various tables and books, including an army income and expenditure comparison table, an income general report, an expenditure general report, and an expenditure classification table. The army is now planning to compile the above-mentioned tables and books into booklets and distribute them to donation agencies or individuals and other organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Sino-British Communication to Realize Full Completion by the End of the Year; All Machines Have Now Arrived in Shanghai; Engineers for Trial Reporting Have Also Returned Home; The Northern Section of Underground Cable Has Been Laid <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-British communication, after a long period of preparation by the Ministry of Communications and the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, is now ready. All the machines are also shipped from the UK to Shanghai the day before yesterday. They will be transported to Zhenru by road vehicle for assembly within days. If it goes smoothly, communication can be achieved by the end of this year. As for the underground cable laid by the Ministry of Communications, a large part of it has also been completed. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>All Machines Arrive in Shanghai; Regarding the machines for Sino-British communication, there are two sets. One set arrived in Shanghai long ago, and one set was shipped from the UK last month. According to reliable information yesterday, the second set of machines was also shipped to Shanghai by British ship and will be moved to Zhenru for assembly within days. There are more than 140 boxes of machines that have arrived in Shanghai this time. The machines that have arrived in Shanghai this time can be called the last batch, but there are still sporadic small parts that will also arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>Trial Reporting Commissioners Return Home; When the Ministry of Communications ordered the telegraph machine, in order to be cautious, it specially sent engineers Lin, Sun, Lu, and Hu to the UK to test the effectiveness of the machine. At the same time, they also took the opportunity to go to Europe and the United States to inspect the transportation facilities of various countries. The four gentlemen have now returned home.</p>
<p>Sino-British Communication Confirmed Date; The exact date for Sino-British communication has not yet been decided by the International Telecommunications Bureau. However, it is estimated that the installation of the machines that arrived in Shanghai this time will take one month, so trial reports may be made one month later, and formal communication may be possible on New Year's Day next year or at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Northern Section of Underground Cable Laid; The Ministry of Communications believes that the aerial wires from Shanghai to Liuhang are vulnerable to wind and rain, so it is now laying underground heavy cables to replace the aerial wires. The cable is divided into two sections, north and south. From Maigen Road to Zhenru is the southern section, and from Zhenru to Liuhang is the northern section. The northern section has been successfully completed, and the southern section has only been started for two or three days. There are ten pairs of aerial cables, while there are fifty pairs of underground cables. Therefore, after the success of the underground cable, it will be much more convenient than the aerial cable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday sent letters to the Public Concession Board of Directors, Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, and Hu Mengjia, requesting them to find a way to resolve the water cut dispute again. The letter said, "To the directors, since the installation of the meter to measure water consumption, the amount of water bills has increased sharply, causing the landlords who collect and pay the bills on behalf of them unable to bear the burden. We are grateful for your negotiation and the establishment of a trial method. Unexpectedly, after the trial method was implemented, the situation did not improve. We have repeatedly sent letters to Zhong Si, the general manager of the Public Concession Board of Directors, urging him to immediately convene the water bill committee that he orally agreed to, in order to discuss it in the long term and try to improve it. Unexpectedly, Zhong Si Jun remained silent on this point, which is a pity. Now, Deli Jingzuo Accounting Firm, a member of our association, has had its water source cut off again by the Shangjin Water Company in the Bolu Li and Boshou Li houses on Pingliang Road, Huasheng Road, Yangzhou Road, and Fenzhou Road, placing people in a desperate situation and coercing them to pay water bills. This is a special and urgent letter to you, asking you to negotiate quickly from the standpoint of humanity and public use: (1) Restore the water supply quickly, (2) Urge the immediate establishment of a water bill committee, (3) Revise the trial solution, and we cannot help but look forward to it."</p>

<p>Chinese detectives Chen Yonggui and Sun Aizhong of the Huishan Patrol House previously arrested Deng Rongting, a Shandong native, on Xinji Bang Road for selling counterfeit banknotes. They found twenty counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications and two central double-corner tickets on him. They also cracked a workshop for manufacturing counterfeit copper corner coins with molds, batteries, and other items in the stove room at No. 182 Shanqing Lane, Erjin Road, his residence. A copper coin was found in the pocket of his wife, Zhang. According to Deng's confession, the various items belonged to his fellow townsman Li Shaozhou, who lived at No. 11 Jiuru Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The stove room was also rented by him. The detectives went to the address with the detectives of the Public Security Bureau and arrested Li. His wife, Zhou, took the opportunity to discard a counterfeit coin worth one yuan on the ground, but it was also picked up by the detectives. The patrol house sent Deng and Li and their wives and the evidence to the First Special District Court for interrogation and custody, which has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, they were also sent to the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol house lawyer, stated the previous situation and presented the counterfeit banknotes, corner tickets, copper coins, manufacturing equipment, and four double-corner coins soaked in potion found on Li and Zhou. He also stated that the counterfeit banknotes and corner tickets had been verified by the two banks and were all counterfeit. The two copper coins had also been identified by a money shop. It was found that the organization could produce dozens of yuan of copper coins every night and had been doing so for more than a year, selling them exclusively in Jiangbei, Tongzhou, and Shanghai. One yuan of genuine currency could buy three or four yuan of counterfeit currency. Deng and Li, the two defendants, mutually shirked responsibility for the house and the manufacturing equipment. The second landlord of the house had left Shanghai for business and could not predict the return date. The patrol house had no way to find out who rented the house. Deng Rongting's counterfeit banknotes were said to be sold by a friend surnamed Ding, who could buy 100 yuan for 10 yuan, and he earned 1.5 yuan commission for every 100 yuan. He was a broker, and the manufacturing organization could not be found out. However, the counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of Communications were well-made and similar to the genuine ones, so many people in society must have been victimized. However, the copper coin model was probably carried and hidden by the person when it was made, and its whereabouts are unknown. The evidence against Li and Zhou, the defendants, was weak, and they were all asked to be severely punished. Deng Ting firmly stated that Li Shaozhou and a fugitive surnamed Gao came to secretly manufacture copper coins after 10:00 PM every night. He sold counterfeit coins and double corners to a friend surnamed Ding in a stove in the North Station Hanqiao area for the first time. Deng Zhang stated that Li Shaozhou and Gao did not allow them to peek when they were working. The coins copied from us were not counterfeit. Li Shaozhou stated that the house was not rented by him, and he did not help Gao to manufacture copper coins. Li Zhou stated that she had nothing to do with the case. The counterfeit coins picked up by the detectives were not thrown away by her. I ask you to identify the silver corners and potions. Judge Wu Zehan ordered Li Zhou to pay bail and be available on call, and the rest were returned to custody separately, and the sentence was scheduled to be announced.</p>

<p>Zhuang Xifan, a beggar from Haimen, is thirty-seven years old. During the day, he begs for a living by picking up cigarette butts on various roads. At night, he sleeps on the streets or in alleys. Three nights ago, he suddenly had good luck. He accidentally picked up a garter on the road. He held it under the electric light and carefully examined it, and he realized that the buttons at both ends of the belt were not made of copper but of gold. He was so happy that he went crazy. The next day, he took it to a silver shop to sell it and exchanged it for seven yuan. For a time, the beggar had a small luck, and he had no idea. He thought that sitting and eating would not last long, so he planned to do a small business to make a living. However, he did not understand the tricks of peddlers and could not start. After thinking about it again and again, he came up with a way to make money easily. He envied those who sell red pills now, who can get several times the profit in one day, and becoming rich can be expected immediately. So he asked a friend who was familiar with this way to introduce him to Jiumu and obtain dozens of packs of red pills from the organization selling red pills. On the first day, he sold them to addicts in various alleys in the French Concession and made a profit of two yuan. Therefore, he still got red pills as usual on the second day and hid them to sell them in various alleys. In the morning, he earned about one yuan. Unexpectedly, on this evening (that is, on the evening of the eighth), at 11:30, he had bad luck again. He was carrying red pills and was selling them to people at the entrance of No. 6, Zhonghua Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession. Just as the French patrol house detectives Hang Guangfu, Lu Songlin, Chen Tinghuai, etc. were patrolling, they saw Zhuang and stopped him for a search. Fifteen small packs of red pills were found on his body, each pack containing eighteen pills, priced at two jiao, totaling 270 pills, worth thirty jiao. He was immediately taken to the patrol house and detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special District Court. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. First, Chen Ming, the patrol house lawyer, reported the case and prosecuted him in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, and presented the red pills as evidence. Zhuang Xifan confessed to selling red pills. The red pills were purchased from an old man Qiang on Luxiangyuan Road, Jiumu, etc. The official ordered the defendant to be detained and wait for the sentence to be announced.</p>

Unexpectedly, at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, she suddenly had severe abdominal pain. At that time, everyone in the family did not know that the woman was about to give birth, and they thought it was a disease, and they were very scared. Later, the woman suddenly gave birth, and what fell to the ground was a triplet, all of whom were male, one was slightly white, one was slightly red, and one was slightly black. The children are also very healthy, and the whole family is very happy. She was only pregnant for more than two hundred days, less than ten months, and she gave birth, which was very surprising.

<p>At Lexinglong Copper Bed Shop at No. 164 Wenyi Road, Wenzhou Road Intersection, at about 6:00 PM the night before yesterday, the partners were working when an apprentice, Zhang Aifu from Shaoxing, 13 years old, suddenly walked to another apprentice, Wang Yaotian from Anhui, 18 years old, and snatched a copper hook he was using. Wang asked for it back, but Zhang not only did not return it, but also cursed him, which led to a quarrel between the two. Later, Zhang hit Wang's right hand with a file. Wang was furious and snatched the file and threw it at Zhang, hitting his left temple, penetrating about an inch, and the brain matter came out. He immediately fainted to the ground and lost consciousness. Later, a person in the shop saw it and immediately sent him to the nearby Huilv Hospital for treatment, but he died of his injuries at about 7:00 AM the next morning. The hospital reported to the Xin Zha Patrol House, and detectives Ma Derong and Xu Huanqing went to investigate and carried Zhang's body into the Ferren Road inspection office. At the same time, Wang was arrested and taken to the patrol house. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xue took his seat and interrogated him. First, Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the patrol house, came forward and reported the investigation process. Then he said that the cause of death of the deceased was still unknown and needed to be verified before it could be clarified. Therefore, he asked to detain the case for a week before filing a lawsuit. The court approved it. Judge Xue briefly questioned Wang Yaotian, the murderer, and the witness Jin Zhao. He then ordered the hearing to be adjourned for a week. At about 10:00 AM, the Procuratorate of the First Court appointed Prosecutor Diao Chengtang to inspect the body with the forensic medical secretary and said, "After inspection, the deceased Zhang Aifu, male, died from being stabbed in the left forehead with a file before his death." The body was handed over to his father, Zhang Amao, to sign a bond and take it back for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that the United Association of Japanese Residents in Shanghai held a standing committee meeting on the afternoon of the 8th to welcome Chairman Lin and discuss various pending cases. Xie Xie Misan, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate General, was discussed for defaming the Japanese residents on pages 246 to 251 of the November issue of Modern Magazine. That is, Xie Xie described the case of the Shanghai Maru Box Corpse, detailing that the husband of the murdered Chinese beauty Cai Lian lived in Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road, "because Yifeng Lane can represent the bad place of the magic capital Shanghai, and can also be said to be a gambling nest." Therefore, the Japanese residents in the lane believe that Xie Xie has been in office for a short time and does not understand the situation in Shanghai, and most of the residents of Yifeng Lane are Japanese, so he should not make such insulting remarks. They all hold resentment. In addition, Modern Magazine has a circulation of more than 9,000 copies in Japan. Now that Police Chief Xie Xie has published this article, the reputation of the Japanese in Shanghai has been greatly affected. Therefore, in addition to the Consulate General apologizing to the Japanese residents, they also want Mr. Xie Xie to make corrections in the original magazine.</p>

<p>Zhou Dayuan, a woman from Ningbo, is twenty years old. Because of poverty in her early years, she was brought to Shanghai and fell into prostitution. Because of her beautiful appearance, she had many regular customers. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, when she was seventeen years old, she had an affair with a guest surnamed Shen. The two sides hit it off, so Shen invested money to redeem her and accepted her as a concubine, welcoming her back to live with the first wife. Because of the fear of the lioness of Hedong, unable to endure the insults, she was divorced within a year and returned to prostitution, hoping to find a satisfactory man to rely on for life. Soon after, she met Sheng Sixian, a fellow townsman. Sheng is now about forty years old and runs a foreign goods business. He has a sole proprietorship of Zhengtailong Foreign Goods Company at No. 36 Xingsheng Street in the French Concession, with considerable assets. He has a wife and children at home. Since Sheng met Dayuan, he found that Dayuan was beautiful, had a moderate figure, and was gentle in nature. After meeting, the two felt like they had met too late, so they had an affair. This spring, Dayuan became pregnant, so Sheng invested money to rent a house at No. 29 Fuming Village, Fuxu Road, and they lived together. Sheng gave her daily living expenses every month. However, although Sheng was over forty years old, he still liked women very much. In addition to his wife and concubines, he often had affairs outside. In September of this year, he had a new love and became unfaithful to Zhou Dayuan. He stopped visiting Zhou and stopped paying daily living expenses, abandoning her. Zhou Dayuan repeatedly visited him, but Sheng avoided meeting her. Dayuan was pregnant and was about to give birth, and she had no money in her hands. In desperation, she hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to file a criminal lawsuit against Sheng in the Second Special District Court, accusing him of abandonment in accordance with Article 310 of the Criminal Law, requesting that he be investigated in accordance with the law, and requesting additional civil lawsuits to recover the plaintiff's alimony and child support fees, totaling 100,000 yuan. According to the complaint, the court specially opened the Second Criminal Court to summon him for trial by Judge Xiong Huiping at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff Zhou Dayuan, who was pregnant, with her chest puffed out and her belly protruding, arrived at the court with her lawyer, and testified to the relationship with the defendant and the process of being abandoned. The defendant did not arrive, and lawyer Xu Yannian arrived on behalf of him, saying that the defendant had gone to the Hangzhou branch to settle accounts, so he did not arrive in court, and asked the court to approve a postponement of three or four days, so that the defendant could arrive in court for trial. The official then informed the defendant's lawyer that the defendant must come to court himself next time. If he avoids appearing in court again, he will issue a warrant for arrest. After the order was given, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to 4:00 PM on the 13th for the defendant to appear in court for further interrogation.</p>

The speech will reportedly detail the various methods of capturing and training lions, tigers, bears, and other wild animals, which is said to be quite interesting. Afterward, a film will be screened depicting the Hagenbeck Zoo in Stellingen, Germany, near Hamburg. The zoo, which houses a large variety of birds and animals, was created by the late Mr. Carl Hagenbeck. It took years of painstaking effort and cost millions of dollars. The zoo is now large and the animals live as if in their natural mountain habitats and caves, free from confinement and discomfort. After the meal, guests will be invited to watch a matinee performance at the circus, enjoying a half-day of entertainment.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday evening, Mr. Huige Nan gave a lecture at the West YMCA, detailing the methods of capturing and raising wild animals. He stated that wild and brutal methods would not work on animals, so animal trainers must first treat animals with kindness to gain their trust before they can be directed as desired. He also said that polar bears look docile, but they are the most cunning, while horses are difficult to train and require great patience. When raising wild animals, it is important to pay attention to fresh air, comfortable living conditions, and abundant food. The animals in the Hagenbeck Zoo are fed six days a week, one meal per day. On Mondays, they are not fed.</p>
<p>It is also reported that several days ago, Mr. Kelaibai, an employee of the circus, was hospitalized for diabetes at Baolong Hospital. His condition worsened and he eventually died. Mr. Kelaibai was born in Germany and had lived in the Far East for a long time. He joined the circus in Japan last month. He loved a Shetland pony that was very intelligent and regarded Mr. Kelaibai as a close friend. The pony followed him around the circus and never left his side. In Tokyo, the pony once escaped when the gatekeeper was not paying attention and followed Mr. Kelaibai to a coffee shop, attracting a crowd of onlookers who found it very amusing. Now that his friend has died, the pony has not eaten for two days. He is being force-fed daily, but his weight is decreasing and it is feared that he will not live much longer. This is truly amazing. Mr. Kelaibai is survived by his wife and four children. The funeral will be held at the Shanghai International Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on Friday.</p>

<p>The Sichuan-Hankou Railway, which sparked the 1911 Revolution, has not been completed for over twenty years. The assets of the Sichuan Railway Company, which was organized for the project, have been nearly exhausted by embezzlement by the intermediate managers. Zhang Taijie, the president and manager, was accused of embezzling over one million yuan in public funds and was sentenced to three years in prison by the Shanghai District Court. He soon died in prison from illness. After Zhang Taijie's death, those suspected of colluding in the embezzlement, including lawyers and shareholders, have been investigated by the court. Now, Liu Yajue, a director of the Sichuan Railway, has also been accused of jointly embezzling a huge amount of money in the mortgage of the Hankou and Zhenjiang properties. The District Court has been investigating this case for years and has finally filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Qian held a court hearing. Due to the lack of witnesses, a brief interrogation was conducted, and the judge ordered a continuation of the hearing with further subpoenas.</p>

<p>The Lafayette Theatre, located at the intersection of Rue Amiral Bayle and Route Lafayette in the French Concession, is a modern movie theatre. The Chinese and Western characters of "Lafayette Theatre" are installed on the high wall of the facade, and "red and green" lights with red tubes are inlaid around the frame. For some unknown reason, the rubber of the lights suddenly caught fire at around 7:00 PM last night, and flames burst out of the wall, causing nearby residents to blow their whistles in alarm. The fire department received the report and dispatched more than ten fire engines to the scene. Fortunately, the wall was high and did not affect the neighbors. The fire extinguished itself after burning for half an hour. Afterward, the theatre urgently hired workers to repair the damage and reopened as usual.</p>

<p>Bao Wenquan, a native of Anhui, whose courtesy name is Rend, opened the Yitaichang Grocery Store at No. 76 Dafang Lane, next to the Fire God Temple in Xiaodongmen. In September of this year, Bao hired workers to repair the old house in the store. Tang Chengsheng, a local resident, 28 years old, who works in the glass business and lives at No. 199 McTaggart Road, also responded to Bao's hiring and went to the store to install glass. Therefore, he met Bao's daughter, Yuzhen, also known as Yingdi. Yuzhen is seventeen years old, beautiful, well-educated, intelligent, and very lively. Tang fell in love at first sight and had bad intentions. He seduced Yuzhen in every possible way. Yuzhen was young and inexperienced, and was fooled by him. On September 20th, Yuzhen suddenly disappeared. Bao searched everywhere, but found no trace. However, he did not know that she had been lured away by Tang. He reported the case to the First Branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. More than a month later, the day before yesterday afternoon, Bao Yuzhen was seen by her cousin on Fuyou Road in Nanshi. The cousin took Bao's daughter to the police station. After questioning by the bureau chief, Bao's daughter confessed the details of what had happened. She said that since being lured out by Tang on September 20th, she was taken to the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road for two nights of adultery. Tang was afraid that the case would be exposed, so he moved her elsewhere. She was moved every few days, and her whereabouts were uncertain. On October 31st, she was sold as a wife to Jin Zhiliang for 120 yuan. Jin is a patrolman at the First Branch of the Second District. The wedding ceremony was held at the Zhixin Hotel on Wuma Road, and they have been living together in Nanshi ever since. Tang now lives at No. 199 McTaggart Road. After hearing the confession, the bureau chief immediately ordered detectives Zhu Songqing and Qu Liansheng to report the case to the Xinzha Police Station at 11:30 PM that night and request assistance. The police chief ordered detective Cai Liu and Bao detective Liu Xuecheng to go to the address and bring Tang Chengsheng and his wife, Tang Zhang, to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the above situation and said that the defendant Tang Chengsheng had confessed to seducing Bao Yingdi and staying at the Tianran Hotel for two nights before moving her elsewhere, so a confession was recorded and presented to the court. However, Tang Zhang denied everything. Detective Zhu Songqing then reported the previous situation, saying that due to time constraints, he had not had time to prepare an official document and requested permission to transfer the case. Bao Wenquan also filed a complaint that his daughter had been abducted by Tang. Judge Xue Lanru briefly questioned Tang Chengsheng and his wife and ordered them to be detained separately, pending the official document from the Public Security Bureau and the transfer of the case for trial.</p>

<p>A woman named Chen Lu, from Shaoxing, 28 years old, had some looks and a romantic nature. Her husband, Lu Zhiyang, worked as a cook at the Dexing Hotel on North Jiangxi Road. They lived in the kitchen of No. 9 Hongji Lane, Xinzha Road. She often went out to wander around. In June of this year, she went to a playground, where she met Lu Xingfa, a carpenter, who was also spending time there. He found her quite attractive and became very envious. He went up to talk to her, and she did not refuse, so they communicated affectionately and got along well. Since then, the two often had secret meetings, but her husband rarely knew about her affair. Recently, she became cold towards Lu, and on the morning of the 3rd of this month, at around 8:00 or 9:00 AM, Lu suddenly took a sharp axe to her house and asked her to go out with him. Unexpectedly, she refused. Lu was extremely angry at the time and raised the axe and struck her head, breaking her skull. She immediately fell to the ground unconscious, covered in blood. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Lu immediately abandoned the axe and fled. Later, her husband was informed and returned home to send her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He then brought her back home for treatment. The day before yesterday, she died from her injuries. After learning of this, the Xinzha Police Station immediately ordered detective Zong Weiting to investigate. He took the body to the Philen Road Mortuary and reported the case to the First Special District District Court. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, prosecutors Guo and Diao visited the mortuary successively to identify the body. According to the statement of the deceased's husband, Chen Zhiyang, 39 years old, he had gone out to work that morning, so he did not know anything about it at first. He also did not know who the murderer was beforehand. He only learned about it after the landlady came to tell him. When he returned home, he saw that his wife had been injured and Lu had fled. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Diao ordered an autopsy and found that the deceased, Chen Lu, female, had died from being struck by an axe. The body was handed over to her husband, Lu Zhiyang, to be returned for burial.</p>

<p>Tang Xisheng, a native of Tongzhou, opened a new tofu shop at No. 276 Zhaojia Road. It officially opened a few days ago. Unexpectedly, a group of ruffians (commonly known as the Thirty-Six Gangs), including Fan Xibing, Xiao Yuming, Gu Jisheng, and Ge Ajin, took advantage of Tang's opening to demand expenses from Tang. Tang politely told Fan and the others that the shop was small and unable to afford the expenses. Fan and the others told Tang that they relied on the mountains to eat from the mountains and relied on their power to eat from their power. If he did not pay, they would give him a hard time. Tang ignored them. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, Fan and the others gathered dozens of hooligans and went to Tang's shop to ask about the situation. They beat him arbitrarily and destroyed all the goods and equipment in the shop. Tang and his staff fought back and captured four people. They called for the police Liu Kaizhi from the Second Branch of the First District to arrest them. Unexpectedly, while Tang Xisheng was on his way to the police station, Fan's accomplices returned to the shop and stole the grinding plate and iron bars used to make tofu, so he could not do business. He reported the case to the police station and requested an investigation. After questioning by the police chief Liu, it was found that Fan Xibing and the others were all unemployed vagrants. The case involves gathering a crowd to extort money. These kinds of unemployed vagrants specialize in extortion and are harmful to society. They must be severely punished to deter them. The police were ordered to send the witness and the suspects to the bureau for severe punishment.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved a letter from the Ministry of Industry, advocating that chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities should establish business schools to promote commercial education and enhance the knowledge of merchants. The two ministries of Education and Industry have now ordered the responsible departments to draft regulations for the establishment of business schools, modeled on the implementation schedule of labor education. After the revision is completed, the Ministry of Industry will issue an order to the chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to implement it earnestly.</p>

<p>Jiangyin's education fees have become increasingly strained in recent years, and the situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Ying Zixiu and Xu Zhengji, from the academic circles living abroad, advocated that at a time when the county's educational finances are in dire straits, with more than eight months of education fees owed throughout the county, in order to centralize education, they specifically telegraphed the Department of Education and the county government to incorporate all assets of various academic societies into the education funds to avoid waste. However, Jiang, the head of the Southeast Township School, instigated his cronies to oppose it. Therefore, although the Jiangyin County Government explicitly ordered the Education Bureau to take over, the Education Bureau has not yet carried out the order. It is reported that fellow villagers from Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang will send letters to urge the Education Bureau to take over, to uphold the law and maintain education.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Ministry of Finance Orders the Consolidated Tax Bureau to Stop Issuing Special Education Funds; Hebei Province's Education Funds Are Fundamentally Shaken <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>There is also talk of reducing 360,000 yuan for the expenses of national universities in Beijing and Tianjin</p>
<p>Education Fee Protection Committee Recommends Li Zheng to Go to Beijing to Visit Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) The education funds of Hebei Province are specifically funded by the consolidated tobacco tax. Recently, the Hebei Financial Special Commissioner's Office was reorganized into the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Consolidated Tax Bureau. The bureau did not issue education funds, so the education funds of Hebei Province were fundamentally shaken. Wei Yuanguang, a representative of the Hebei Provincial School Federation, came to Beijing on the 6th. That evening, Tingjin also promoted Yang Shaozhong, Qi Guoliang, and Li Banghan as representatives. The three representatives arrived in Beijing today (the 7th). When the reporter visited Yang at his residence, he said the following:</p>
<h3 id="e229">Yang Shaozhong Speaks <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The total education funds for Hebei Province are more than 3 million yuan per year, of which 1.2 million yuan is a special education fund. This special fund was stipulated by Zhang Zongchang in the 15th year of the Republic of China to be allocated from the consolidated tobacco tax, with a monthly allocation of 100,000 yuan. The expenses of each school rely on this for support. The remaining amount is allocated by the Hebei Provincial Government ordering the Finance Department to find ways to allocate it. The education special fund is allocated by the Hebei Financial Special Commissioner's Office. Now the Special Commissioner's Office has been abolished by order of the Ministry of Finance and reorganized into the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Consolidated Tax Bureau. The bureau has been ordered by the Ministry to temporarily suspend the issuance of the education special fund, and all kinds of negotiated funds are to be reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The funds will be allocated after approval. In fact, the education special fund has long been designated to be allocated from the consolidated tobacco tax and is not a negotiated fund. It is a special fund in nature and is completely different from a negotiated fund. If the special fund is suspended, the education funds will be shaken, and the education of the entire province will be bankrupt. The goals of the representatives in coming to Beijing this time are two: (1) The nature of the education special fund is different from other negotiated funds and the authorities should be requested to allocate it monthly; (2) The education special fund is eight, nine, ten, and three months in arrears and requests that it be made up. First, a petition will be filed in Beijing. If there is no satisfactory result, personnel will be sent to Beijing to visit Minister Kong to deal with it in person.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) The expenses of national universities in Beijing and Tianjin are 360,000 yuan and there are rumors of a reduction, which has caused great panic among teachers and staff. The Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Expenses Management Committee has, in addition to telegraphing the Ministries of Education and Finance to urge the remittance of the October education expenses, also recommended Li Zheng as a representative to go to Beijing for negotiations. Li left by train today (the 7th). Before leaving Beiping, Li made the following remarks to reporters:</p>
<h3 id="e230">Li Zheng Speaks <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>I am going to Beijing this time for three tasks: (1) To negotiate the expenses of higher education in Beijing and Tianjin. There are rumors that the central government will reduce the education expenses of colleges and universities in Beijing and Tianjin. It remains to be investigated after arriving in Beijing whether this is true. The Management Committee entrusted me to negotiate in Beijing. As I am also a member of the Management Committee, I should of course fulfill my obligations. After arriving in Beijing, I will separately visit Minister of Finance Kong (Xiangxi), Minister Wang (Shijie), and Mr. Li Shizeng to request the authorities to allocate education fees on time every month. The higher education expenses in Beijing and Tianjin are 260,000 yuan per month, which is allocated from the Russian Boxer Indemnity Fund. The Ministry of Finance instructs the National Treasury Department to allocate it to the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Expenses Management Committee every month, obtain the receipt of the Management Committee, enter it into the income assets, and report it to the Minister of Finance. This method was approved by Minister Song (Ziwen). Now that Minister Kong has taken office, the procedures for allocating the expenses of colleges and universities in the future may not be changed, but there must also be a negotiation and the October education expenses must be urged; (2) To report to the Ministry of Education on the school affairs and progress plan of the Normal University and to negotiate on the new curriculum standards; (3) To handle the higher examination assistant examination matters. Originally scheduled to go to Beijing on the 10th, I started earlier because I received a telegram from the Examination Yuan.</p>

<p>This year's River-Zhejiang Private Secondary School Football and Basketball Tournament, according to previous guidance meetings by the various schools, has been decided to be held on December 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 18th (Gregorian calendar) at Soochow University in Suzhou. A meeting of the guidance counselors from each school will be held on the evening of the 12th at 7:00 PM to discuss matters related to the tournament. The issue of accommodations for the athletes from each school has already been resolved, with all staying at the school. All member schools of the association are urged to prepare early, participate enthusiastically, and send the registration forms directly to Mr. Tu Shouxun at Soochow University in Suzhou one week before the tournament. It is noted that this combined football and basketball league should have been held separately, but schools from various regions, considering transportation difficulties, time constraints, and economic factors, have reluctantly reverted to the old format. However, the tournament dates have been slightly extended and made more ample compared to last year, so there are no concerns regarding the physical and mental well-being of the athletes.</p>

<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Venue: Yesterday, the weather was clear, and the primary school students were all in high spirits. The entrance to the Public Sports Field on Dalin Road was bustling with people and vehicles. Outside the short bamboo fence surrounding the venue, students from various schools stood guard, with brightly colored flags fluttering in the wind. The stage was set up in the north of the venue, with a white cloth banner hanging above that read, "The Fifth Annual Joint Primary School Games of Shanghai Municipality." A pair of couplets hung beside it: "Gather all Shanghai primary school students to test their physical education" and "Promote the Chinese nation and enhance martial prowess." Several pots of chrysanthemums were placed on the stage, and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen with the Party and national flags crossed in the center. The Public Security Bureau and the Shanghai Poor Children's Home military band arrived to play music. The East Asia Boy Scouts and the Southern District Security Corps maintained order.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Address: The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. After raising the flag and playing music, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the chairman, delivered a speech, stating briefly that today is the opening of the fifth annual primary school games in the city. The mayor was unable to attend due to a cold and sent Mr. Gongzhan as his representative. Our country has reached a critical moment of life and death. If we do not revive our country soon, it will perish. To escape the danger of extinction and achieve the goal of revival, our youth must take responsibility. The purpose of the primary school games is to train the physique of every primary school student so that they can shoulder the responsibility of saving the country in the future. He hoped that everyone would work hard and persevere.</p>
<p>Speeches from All Sectors: Subsequently, Mr. Lin Meiyan, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating briefly that the first thing we should do in sports is to be hygienic and not harm the body for the sake of winning championships. Secondly, we must be collective and not focus solely on the individual. Thirdly, we must popularize sports so that they can deeply penetrate the people. Then, Honorary Instructor Huang Zaoxiong delivered a speech with many words of encouragement.</p>
<p>▲ Report on Meeting Affairs: Finally, Secretary-General Shao Rugan reported on the affairs of the meeting, stating briefly that there are 32 track and field events in this year's games, including 20 for boys and 12 for girls.

<p>Many schools participated in the group exercises this time. On the first day yesterday, there were 19 sections in the morning and 46 sections in the afternoon. Due to time constraints, performances from five or six schools were held simultaneously in the afternoon. For a time, the venue was filled with the sounds of music, voices, commands, and the clashing of dumbbells, which was very lively. The orderly steps and graceful movements aroused the excitement of the entire audience.</p>

<p>▲ Adorable Kindergarten Students: Kindergarten students are the most delightful, with their beautiful and adorable costumes. Their programs are also quite brilliant, such as the flower planting by the Municipal First Kindergarten, the threading game by Wuben, the small music band by Shangwen, and the unified defense against insults by Nanxun. Each is ingenious and particularly commendable.</p>
<p>▲ Comprehensive Group Exercises: More than 60 schools participated in the group exercises yesterday. The uniforms were all different and exceptionally neat. The performance programs, such as the air combat by Chengzhong, the small soldiers by He'an, the killing of enemies by Wusong, "Let's Form a Small Group" by Jingye, and the small farmers by Wuben, all had special significance and embodied a martial spirit. The other schools' freehand exercises, dances, and other performances were also quite brilliant.</p>
<p>▲ Girls' Group B Outperforms Group A in Softball Throwing: In the girls' softball throw, both Group A and Group B participated. Group A's performance was mediocre, with the highest record being only 29.3 meters. Li Shusen of Guangdong Primary School in Group B achieved a score of 30.11 meters, surpassing Group A, and is truly a promising talent. However, the throwing postures of each group yesterday were mostly poor. They were either too fast or stood still, relying entirely on talent. If they could be trained, their scores would be much higher.</p>
<p>▲ Fashion Show by Female Teachers: Most of the physical education teachers participating in the group exercises from each school are female, and their clothing is particularly noteworthy. Apart from a few female teachers wearing plain school uniforms, the rest are very fond of fashion. For example, the female teacher from a certain school wore a brand-new outfit from top to bottom, with her shoes not even touching the mud. Therefore, the general audience competed to watch. Yesterday, the female teachers' fashion show added a lot of color to the venue.</p>

<p>Huasaishi, newly arrived in Shanghai, drew 1-1 with Jinan in the Shigaota Cup. At the time, observers examined their approach and probed their strength, concluding that they were by no means mediocre. In yesterday's friendly match against Youyou, they showed their true colors, defeating Youyou 8-4. It was clear that their skills were excellent, and they were indeed a first-class team.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Overview of the Two Teams <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Huasaishi is full of talent. The five forwards are agile and quick-footed. Center Moleen is the leader of the group. The defense is very strong, and the interior is well-organized with few gaps. Youyou's inside defenders, Lu Zhiming and Cheng Guoyin, lack strength and experience. The defense is not good, but the forwards work hard. In the first half, they succumbed to the iron cavalry, ending 1-3. In the second half, they made great strides, tying the score at 4-4. Unexpectedly, their momentum collapsed, and they lost four goals, ending in an 8-4 defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Course of the Match <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle, and the fierce battle began. Before long, Huasaishi's center Moleen broke through the line, and Youyou was caught off guard and conceded a goal. After ten minutes of intense fighting, right winger Shepote benefited from the center's assistance and scored again. Youyou launched a counterattack but missed several opportunities. Suddenly, Moleen again broke through the line, making it 3-0. Youyou was furious, and the entire army advanced. Center Hu Youcheng broke through the enemy's goal, making it 3-1 at halftime, with Huasaishi in the lead. At the start of the second half, Youyou veteran Zhu joined the team, boosting the morale of the entire army. They attacked more than they defended and had hopes of recovering. Unexpectedly, in the midst of their strong momentum, they were hit by the enemy's Aguerre, making it 1-4. The former elite spirit was still there, and they were very active in the enemy's formation. Li Shuoyou tried a shot, and it unexpectedly hit the mark, making it 2-4. From then on, their demeanor changed completely, and Youyou's momentum rose. Within ten minutes, Hu You and Chen Jiaqiu each scored a goal, tying the score at 4-4. The good times did not last, and bad luck struck again. Moleen, in the midst of thousands of troops, was as if in no man's land, scoring one, two, three, and four goals, making it an 8-4 victory.</p>

<p>The gold market fell sharply again yesterday, but the overall market situation was relatively calm for the day. The future market was stable and slightly firm. In the early morning, due to the British market shrinking and the American market rising, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 7.5 to 8 li. Exchange rates rose in unison.

American cotton rose 33 points, and American wheat also rose 2.875 points. The raw material market opened and immediately broke the 40 yuan mark. After the opening, due to the strengthening of the domestic market, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Cheng Fengyong and others were buying, but Dachencheng was aggressively selling bars, and Western merchant La Lai was also selling. People's hearts were unsettled, so even though speculator Wu and Cheng Fengyong and others entered the market, the situation still declined. At noon, as the exchange market became firmer, it became even more difficult to support due to speculator Yang's aggressive selling. In the afternoon, the market trended tighter, and the situation rebounded. The supply in the market seemed to be drying up, so the future market remained firm throughout. People's hearts were calm, and banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, resulting in a lot of fluctuation. The market situation was mediocre for the day, and the major players disagreed, so the situation fluctuated. Overseas news had no special impact. The "red hot" price was 1,110 yuan, and the spread was 9.8 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>

Hengtai, Shunli, and Yuanmaoyong sold, retreating to 5.3 yuan. Hengxing and Hengyuyi took advantage of the low prices to buy bars.

The highest price for the day was 738.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 733.5 yuan, a difference of 5.3 yuan. The result was a decline of 11 yuan from the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The announced price was 747 yuan due to HSBC's US dollar listed price rising 0.5 yuan to 32.125 yuan, calculated at the standard gold price, which was about 10 yuan higher than the closing price, less than 1 yuan less than the previous closing price.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to political rumors, relations between Japan and Russia were on the verge of collapse, and the situation was increasingly tense. In addition, the central government's finances still lacked concrete solutions. The environment was already unfavorable to bulls. Only the fourth brokerage firm was still buying. Although sellers were scattered, they were numerous. Market prices gradually declined in each round and at each listing, and the trend remained weak. Although salt tax closed steadily, there was no sign of a rebound. In the morning, the only buyer that attracted attention was the fourth brokerage firm. Although the reorganization bonds were still firm, other issues were surrounded by sellers, and prices weakened. The fourth brokerage firm bought a relatively large amount of 1929 Customs Bonds in the second round, but the market price still failed to stabilize. Afterwards, the consolidated salt tax was relatively stable. In the afternoon, market sentiment was slightly stronger, and scattered retail investors covered short positions. The 47th brokerage firm had some demand, and market prices rebounded slightly. However, the forward contracts for consolidated salt tax declined by another 1.5 jiao, and the situation remained unfavorable. At the close, the Northern Gang was selling a lot, and the fourth brokerage firm had stopped buying. All brokerage firms sold more than they bought, and prices fell significantly, declining by another 1 to 5.5 jiao. However, forward salt tax only declined by 5 fen. In total, market prices mostly declined by 5, 6, or 7 jiao. The forward salt tax declined by over 1 yuan, which was the largest decline.

<p>Sincere Trading Company reported that on the 8th, the New York stock market was quiet all day. Later, due to strong commodities, the US dollar continued to weaken, and silver prices reached a new three-year high. The government's cotton harvest estimate was smaller than private estimates, and trading suddenly became active. The market rose sharply, with some issues rising by 6 yuan compared to the previous day. The election had no impact on the market. The total daily transaction volume was 1.8 million shares, and the trend seemed to continue upward. "Wheat": Domestic and international news will favor the bullish side and will continue to rise. "Cotton": The government's harvest report was smaller than generally predicted, and confidence was restored. There was considerable demand for forward contracts, and inquiries for spot goods were still quiet, but the basis was firm. "Silver": The opening was very low. Later, due to the weak US dollar and rumors that the US government planned to purchase 1 million ounces of spot silver, the closing was very strong. As far as we know, in recent days, there have been large transactions with limit sell orders set at 2 fen below today's closing price. The Financial Rehabilitation Society announced that the price of gold was 33.05 yuan per tael, an increase of 0.21 yuan. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

The November and December positions were extremely strong in the morning market. Sui Long Company, acting on behalf of its cotton industry association, sold over 11,000 bales, with scattered short covering. However, the market trend turned sharply downward when the auction reached the January positions. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were sluggish, and all parties were constrained by financial difficulties, creating an unfavorable environment. The market trend continued downward. The storm has now subsided.</p>

<p>The cotton market appears weak due to sluggish yarn sales and difficulties for factories. The intention to purchase raw materials is quite stagnant. The selling price of Indian cotton is increasingly cheap, and the demand for domestic cotton is even lower. Unexpectedly, the third estimate of American cotton increased production by more than 200,000 bales, but prices rose by 35 points per pound. However, with the exchange rate rising and gold prices falling daily, the purchasing price is still low, and the future situation is flat. However, Japanese merchants have reached an agreement on Indian cotton and have no intention of purchasing domestic cotton.</p>

<p>The flour market is trending higher, as factories are holding back supply, and actual sales are very strong. This has also attracted inquiries from hoarders and inland buyers, improving market sentiment. Floating investors are actively entering the market. Also, the foreign telegraph reported large increases of 5, 6, 7, and 8 jiao, causing the opening price to rise by about 1 fen. Later, competition between actual sales and short covering caused prices to rise. This month, prices once soared to 2.215 yuan, up 3 fen from the previous day. Although multiple parties took profits, the market returned to stability. However, factories remain firm, and customers and hoarders are still making inquiries. Before the arrival of large quantities of foreign flour and wheat is determined, the market should be able to hold steady. Closing prices: November, December, and January up 1.25 fen, February up 1 fen, March up 1.5 fen, and April up 2 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat opened higher, due to the foreign wheat report increasing by 7 and 8 jiao, improving market sentiment. Factories bought near-term labeled wheat, which triggered short covering and new buying. In the afternoon, hoarders made inquiries, and prices rose even more sharply. Currently, the amount of spot wheat arriving and in storage is low, and factories are very selective, leading to a more optimistic market and sentiment. Closing prices: November and March up 7 fen, December and January up 6 fen, February up 5 fen, and April up 1 fen. Spot wheat opened at 3.62 yuan for Luhe and 3.58 yuan for Pudong, with 400 bags handled by Xin Da.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was over 40 vendors with about 5,000 shi of goods, mostly from Nangang, with Chang and Su gangs each accounting for half. Qingjiao and Sifeng and other types were only 11 to 12 boats. Therefore, the situation in this street's stores was similar to before, but the market was tighter than before. In addition, sellers were asking for extremely high prices, so the market price for Chang and Su gangs' indica rice was up Jiao Xu. Due to the large amount of Nangang and other box rice arriving, the situation remained stable. Duyang pointy rice was also flat. Because the amount of Qingjiao and other late rice arriving since the beginning of the season was limited, about 1,000 bags were handled. Although the situation was brisk, buying pressure was still severe, so prices were only slightly better by a few fen. The path for selling Biangyuan was not wide, and the market was declining, with prices at a level of about 0.2 jiao for prices of repaired Biangyuan. Yinyuan was also soft by 0.5 fen.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 40 vendors arrived from various boats downstream. The sales routes for various goods on the market continued to be for those with cheaper prices. New indica, broken indica, Yangbu indica, thin rice, and early rice were all presenting a situation of standing firm. Duke indica and Yinyuan were flat and weak. Baiyuan was down another 0.15 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke indica rice market was originally soft. After the Ke gang stopped buying for several days, the owners all wanted to sell, with a continuous stream of arrivals and sufficient inventory, the situation was quite weak. However, yesterday, hoarder from this street and the Fujian gang suddenly showed favor, and transactions were suddenly strong. In fact, market prices have already reached the bottom, and the authorities have sales cooperation and control plans, so that it will not be allowed to fall sharply again. Hoarders have not made inquiries for a long time, and with this opportunity, it is perfect to carry out hoarding. Then the street united with the Fuzhou and Quanzhou gangs from Fujian Province to jointly purchase, superficially for the Fujian Ke gang's sales route, but in reality, most were for hoarder inquiries. The market became active, and prices also turned stable. Throughout the day, 496 bags of Hunan rice, 390 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,400 bags of Jing rice, 570 bags of Xi rice, 900 bags of Shashi rice, and 101 bags of Anqing rice were sold. Prices were similar to the previous market, but the Hunan crude oil was newly arrived and opened for sale for the first time at a price of 6.2 yuan.</p>

<p>The rise and fall of the sesame market depends entirely on the Yiwu gang's oil pressing appetite. Because foreign firms have been stagnant for a long time, and other gangs such as Little Luzon, this street, Fujian, and Guangdong have few sales routes. A few days ago, the Shao gang once purchased over 1,000 bags, and the market once rose by 0.5 yuan. Recently, because the gang's appetite has not moved, prices have softened again. Yesterday, the Shantou gang purchased 101 bags of Tushan sesame, with a price of 6.3 yuan. The Guangdong gang purchased 90 bags of Shashi sesame, with a price of 7.8 yuan. The Fuzhou gang sold 29 bags of Jiangxi sesame, opening at 6.5 yuan. There was also a Xinghua gang transaction of 50 bags of Jiujiang machine sesame, with a price of 6.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms in this port became increasingly quiet. European firms were despondent due to depleted inventories. In recent days, most merchants have been engaged in reporting the export of goods purchased several months ago. Therefore, current sales are increasingly quiet. Yesterday, only Xingcheng, Tianxiang, Tongfu, and other firms purchased a total of over 200 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei, and Xiumei. The tea market, except for Wuyuan Zhenmei, which opened at 125 yuan and was not much changed from before, most other teas fell by 1 to 2 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e273">One Crab Is Not As Good As Another <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>—Yan Qiao</p>
<p>These past few days, Yangcheng Lake freshwater crabs have come on the market. Perhaps influenced by Mr. Five Willows, holding a crab claw and admiring chrysanthemums is considered an elegant affair. Whether farmer, worker, merchant, student, or soldier, if they have some spare money, they must buy one to taste it, which can be counted as keeping up with the times. "Round belly in September, pointed in October," the crabs get better every day. I think that what Mr. Five Willows' descendant, Mr. Gu, felt at the seat of King Zhongyi of Wu-Yue, that "one crab is not as good as another," was just a chance encounter at the time. In reality, it must be said that one crab is better than the last. Because from the late spring and early summer, the crabs have gradually grown and improved. Once the west wind blows, they become even more substantial. The crabs in September are definitely better than those in August, and the pointed crabs in October are better than the round-bellied ones in September. It is not until next year, when the peach blossom waters rise, that the crab friends will go back to the bottom of the water to pursue the opposite sex and engage in reproduction, and then they will disappear from sight. Therefore, we only feel that eating crabs every day gets better and better.</p>
<p>I don't know how, but this old humorous saying, once people heard it, they borrowed it to mean "getting worse and worse," as a metaphor for human affairs. They also think that people's spiritual civilization is especially in line with this saying. When we listen to those pessimists, about everything in the modern age, except for material civilization, which one is not sighed over with "one crab is not as good as another"? Then isn't the reality of the crab and the symbolism of the crab in a relative position?</p>
<p>However, in the countryside, they have felt the full taste of this saying. They catch crabs very easily. In the evening, they take a lamp and a basket to the lakeside, and they can always catch a few in one evening. Because of the sharp fall in rice prices and the collapse of the rural economy in the past few years, even if they catch crabs, they are reluctant to try the new ones themselves. They have to sell them on the market to exchange them for money. Also, those who catch crabs for a living say that selling crabs now for more than 100 cash per ounce is not as profitable as selling crabs for only 10 cash per ounce more than a decade ago. Because their living expenses have increased by more than ten times. Then, the whole society has formed "one crab is not as good as another."</p>
<h3 id="e274">Briefly Discussing Various Names for Women <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xiang</p>
<p>Let's not talk about politics or romance; how about talking about women's names?</p>
<p>▲ Miss With the eastward movement of European customs, the title of "Miss" has almost replaced "Miss" [小姐] in terms of position. Of course, this "Miss" is only popular in "civilized" areas, such as universities and the "upper social strata." Daughters of prominent families are still called "Miss" [小姐], to show gravity. I remember last year, Shanghai newspapers reported that a certain girls' school in Peiping banned students from calling each other "Miss" and instead called them "Miss" [小姐], seemingly for the reason of preserving national culture. But in my opinion, it also feels like a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>▲ Vase This "vase" is also one of the newly emerging names for women. Literally, everyone can see that this is not a name with good intentions, but merely a male nickname, assigned in secret, with a hint of sarcasm. Tracing back the origin of this "vase," it should go back to a few years ago when women occupied a corner of the social professions in Shanghai. At that time, it was fashionable in offices and companies to hire a group of women; and these misses seemed to dress up a bit too much, inevitably attracting the attention of the general public in society; thus the name "vase" arose in response to the times. But the area of popularity is not wide, seemingly limited to the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>▲ Female Child This strange name is found in Water Margin, in Ximen Qing's words: "Godmother, come here, I ask you: Who are the young people next door, this female child [雌兒]?" Clearly, this is not a good word either, in fact containing a bit of contemptuous insult, only a great official like Ximen would dare to say it. Because people can only be divided into men and women, and not into male and female: male and female can only be applied to lower animals. Fortunately, I have not heard anyone called "female child:" probably because I live in the "middle class society." In the "lower classes" of the inland, it is still popular, but it is also unspeakable. But this can only await investigation by linguists, and will not be discussed in detail here.</p>
<p>Calligraphy by the famous calligrapher Xu Tiefeng</p>
<p>Since the calligrapher Xu Tiefeng came to Shanghai to sell his calligraphy, his career has been thriving. Xu's skill is pure and his brushwork is meticulous and intentional, without the slightest carelessness or bad habits. Because his former residence was not enough to display his work, he has now moved to a new residence at No. 5 Siming Lane, Avenue Joffre. At the same time, he has also joined with literary giants and famous calligraphers and painters from home and abroad to establish a Shangyou Literary and Art, Epigraphy, Calligraphy, and Painting Cooperative, dedicated to promoting elegance and serving society. Many people from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Peiping have joined.</p>
<p>▲ Widow Old Woman This is a slang term used by the "vagrants" class to call women. It occupies considerable power in the "lower class society," and it is only natural that it cannot be inserted into the "upper middle class society." But I cannot accurately know where the words "widow old woman" come from, and I have no opportunity to ask "those people." However, according to my wildest guess, this "widow old woman" seems to be similar to the transliteration of "Girl." Speaking of which, I remember that recently someone translated it as "dog girl." Although it is a transliteration, but to call women directly by "dog girl," then shouldn't men also be "male dogs"? This is exactly the same fault that the great official Ximen made.</p>
<p>The more I talk, the further I get, so let's "stop" here.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Remembering Shen Yichong <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Nanding</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Yichong was through the introduction of my half-mad sworn brother. Initially, my fifth younger brother, Zhuan Tao, exchanged letters with Yichong, their spirits having long been acquainted. As for me, I was busily running around, only occasionally hearing his name, never once exchanging greetings. In the year of Jiazi, Qi Lu engaged in warfare, and in my old homeland of the three Wu regions, nine out of ten households moved, seeking refuge on the sea. My sworn brother, Ban Kuang, brought his family to Shanghai, and Zhuan Tao also arrived with his parents. I was staying west of Xipu, practicing the ways of a merchant, and was very happy to see them. Ban Kuang rented a place in western Shanghai. Zhuan Tao and I attended to our parents, staying in an inn. Ban Kuang would visit almost daily, gathering in one room, and many friends from the sea came to visit. Yichong was thus acquainted with me at the inn. At that time, Yichong was working in a bank. Speaking with him, he was heroic and forthright, unlike someone from the marketplace. Though Yichong dealt with petty cash daily, his nature was chivalrous. He granted all requests, enjoyed making friends, viewed gold as dirt, was a skilled drinker and speaker, and everyone who associated with him was happy. In the tenth month of winter, the disturbances of Man and Chu subsided, and my hometown was safe. Ban Kuang and Zhuan Tao agreed to return home. I was burdened with worldly affairs and did not see Yichong again. The following year, I returned to my hometown to attend to my parents, as my homeland was frequently alarmed by rumors of war. I had been separated from Yichong for two years. Zhuan Tao, however, had business on the sea and spent his days and nights with Yichong. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, Ban Kuang accepted General Bi's invitation and temporarily took charge of the secretariat, traveling with me. Passing through the sea, Yichong came to see us and hosted a banquet for Ban Kuang and me. His heroic spirit was the same as before. He drank wine like a whale sucking in hundreds of rivers, his aura vast and unparalleled. After General Bi was killed, Ban Kuang and I returned to the sea, but Yichong had suffered a business failure and was rejected by his uncle. However, his nature and spirit did not diminish as a result, and he was as philosophical as before. Later, Yichong was isolated and unable to fit in, and his circumstances became increasingly difficult. His uncle, on the other hand, was wealthy for a time but did not give him a second glance, remaining indifferent despite the pleas of friends. I, too, had no savings and could not help an old friend in need, which I still feel guilty about. During the January 28th Incident, Yichong was caught in the crossfire, and his home was destroyed. However, Yichong did not take it as a loss, only lamenting that human feelings were thinner than autumn clouds. He often seemed lost and bewildered. The other day, a friend came to tell me that Yichong had gone to the call of Xiuwen. Hearing this, Ban Kuang and I faced each other silently, not knowing that tears had wet our clothes. Recalling the past, his lofty and heroic spirit is still vivid before me. Who knew that his lifespan would not reach its end and that he would return to heaven? Alas!</p>
<p>▲ Short News: Yijin Grass, issued by the Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company of this city. It is said to be effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, hemoptysis, and other symptoms. It has been repeatedly verified by famous Chinese and Western doctors. Recently, it has also been proven by experiments conducted by Dr. Liu Guoxiang and Dr. Wang Hongyun of Shanghai Southeast Hospital. Due to insufficient space at its old address on Zhonghua Road, the company has moved this summer to Rende Lane, Zhaozhou Road, at the intersection of Dongxi Lin Road, Tangjiawan, outside the West Gate. The branch sales office in the northern city is still located in Deyu Lane, at the intersection of Yingda Road and Yinghe Road. (Star)</p>
<p>▲ Short News: Wujin Eye Drops were created in the Ming Dynasty by a royal physician from Lingnan. The method was traditionally passed down only to sons and daughters-in-law. It was not until the mid-Qing Dynasty that He Tongren Pharmacy was established, which has secretly manufactured this medicine for over 150 years. It is sold in South China and overseas. It is effective for all eye diseases and habitual late nights, restlessness, and insomnia. Applying it before bed has remarkable effects overnight for young people. Its side effects can also treat external hemorrhoids, boils, carbuncles, and venereal diseases. A distribution office has been established at 385A Jiujiang Road to help the world.</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Conveying Tea With Affection, Comforting Her Husband With Sorrow; Hastily Leaving the Frontier, Forcing a Smile to Bid Farewell to Her Family</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang thought to himself, if he told his father the truth, that he would never return, his father might start crying before he even left. So, he puffed out his chest, straightened up, and shouted loudly: "Dad, I'm leaving, I'll be back this afternoon." As he spoke, his heels clicked together loudly, and he raised his hand in a military salute to his father. Suddenly, he turned around, as if on the parade ground, walking with proper steps, lifting his feet and marching out. As he walked, he looked straight ahead, not looking anywhere else, until he had walked out of Haidian Street in one breath. Only then did he turn around, stand still in a daze, looking intently at the row of rooftops on Haidian Street, while lowering his head and letting out a long sigh. Just then, he saw a cloud of dust rising at the end of the road, and the quartermaster and several brothers, driving the draft animals pulling the large cart, were running as fast as they could. The large wheels of the cart rolled on the pedestrian road, rumbling loudly. When they reached him, the quartermaster, who had been sitting on the cart, jumped down from the cart in the distance, raising his hand and saying: "Company commander, you went ahead alone." Zhao Ziqiang heard this and couldn't help but feel ashamed. He thought, "I'm really absent-minded, how could I leave them behind and go ahead alone? What did I come to Haidian for?" So he smiled and said: "I knew you would catch up, I was waiting for you here." They were smiling and talking here, and each of the servants who came with the carts held a thin whip in his hand, dragging the tips of the whips on the ground. Each person's face also had a kind of deathly gray color, especially the one in front, the carter. He wore an old blue cloth short coat with several patches on it. He was wearing a sauce-colored felt hat, the brim as soft and weak as he was, scattered down around, half covering his face. (236)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e277">One Morning (Part 2) <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>He felt that perhaps it was his wearing a suit that attracted their attention. He felt that before, when he came out, he was always with the landlord's son.</p>
<p>He ran back slowly. When he reached the door, he saw his cousin arguing with two children:</p>
<p>"Why didn't your old man come?"</p>
<p>"He's sick."</p>
<p>"Then why are you so late?"</p>
<p>"Sir: Can't run fast!"</p>
<p>"If you can't run fast, what are you doing delivering newspapers?"</p>
<p>"No one else to deliver them!"</p>
<p>From Jin Fu's mouth, he learned that these two children were the newspaper deliverer's sons and that they were being scolded because they were a little late today. Ping naturally did not agree with his cousin's actions, but he didn't dare say anything.</p>
<p>Another morning. Ping was waiting at the door for the newspaper deliverer. After waiting for a while, he came. A child with a newspaper bag on his back walked over from a distance. Just one child, a slightly older child. Ping grabbed his collar:</p>
<p>"Where's the other little kid?"</p>
<p>"He can't walk, he's not coming."</p>
<p>"Is the newspaper deliverer your dad? Was the kid who came yesterday your brother?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>He was silent, surprised as if he had discovered something. The newspaper delivery boy went into the house, delivered the newspaper, and came out again. He was walking back the way he came when Ping suddenly grabbed his arm</p>
<p>"Wait, are you going back?"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"I ask you: How many people are there in your family?"</p>
<p>"Including me, there are eight, one dad; one mom, one older sister, and four younger brothers..."</p>
<p>"..........................."</p>
<p>He stood up straight as if he were crazy: He remembered everything, he remembered that the working masses in the movie were probably them, he seemed to realize something, he also thought of his landlord uncle and cousin, he felt disgusted, felt that there were clearly two worlds丨丨two worlds of unequal wealth... He looked at the sky with a very expressive face, and raised his other hand high, and suddenly grabbed his hair. This action stunned the newspaper delivery boy:</p>
<p>"Sir: I have to go!" The child's voice made him realize that he was holding his arm tightly, and he smiled.</p>
<p>"How far is it to your house?"</p>
<p>"A dozen miles, less than twenty miles."</p>
<p>"Let's go together"</p>
<p>"You can't walk!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You're younger than me, why can't I walk? How do you know I can't walk?" He was secretly afraid of being discovered by his uncle's family, who would stop him.</p>
<p>Ping wanted to taste the bitterness of labor, and resolutely began to walk with the young newspaper vendor. He walked out of the village and onto the rice paddies, barren mounds, and wild tombs. There were only rough, narrow paths with thorns, not the wide avenues of asphalt roads. This was Ping's first attempt in his life. The fiery sun was scorching his head and back... Gradually, it became lively. Teahouses, butcher shops, lamp wick shops, and women carrying firewood on their shoulders all looked at him with unblinking eyes. Ping wanted to rest. They stepped into a small teahouse to drink tea and eat snacks. Ping saw him chewing very happily, as if he hadn't eaten breakfast. Ping thought again that he didn't have such food to eat every day. He discovered that not all children in the world have clothes to wear, food to eat, and books to read.</p>
<p>The two started walking forward in great strides, walking, walking, finishing their journey, reaching their destination. Although Ping was tired and his body was soaked in sweat, a happy smile appeared on his face, as if he were victorious. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e278">A Glorious End <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>In these recessionary years, it seems that the ways for the petty bourgeoisie to seek stimulation have also been exhausted. One can tell by looking at the newspapers that what is taken as extraordinary news is: Jiang Minsheng shining shoes, Liang Tongfang pulling a rickshaw, "Anti-Japanese heroes ending up like this." These things have also become good topics of conversation! However, I do not understand.</p>
<p>I remember someone discussing Ibsen's famous play "A Doll's House," about the protagonist Nora's departure, saying: "The departure of one Nora might not be difficult, because the character is very special, the action is fresh, and she can get some people's sympathy, helping her live. Living under people's sympathy is already not free. However, if there are a hundred Noras leaving, even sympathy will be reduced. If there are a thousand or ten thousand leaving, they will be disgusted." Everyone knows that this is the truth, and there is an ancient saying to prove it: "Rarity makes things valuable."</p>
<p>But the circumstances of Major General Jiang Minsheng cannot be compared with Nora. First, retired generals engaging in humble occupations (?) are not considered "special" or "fresh." Second, there are certainly countless such characters, unlike Nora, who was the only one at the time. So, why do the newspaper reporters of Shanghai promote people and affairs that are not rare?</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a kind of indignation implied in this. Both are anti-Japanese heroes, but some are in dire straits while others are soaring to success. Is it specifically brought up for comparison? But such things are not surprising! When King Mu of Zhou conquered the south, the entire army was transformed: gentlemen became apes and cranes, and commoners became insects and sand. This has been the case since ancient times, and isn't it more prevalent today that generals make a name for themselves by exploiting the dead, and the wealthy profit from weapons? In a society where everything is unfair, what does this kind of unfairness amount to? Do the petty bourgeoisie think that all anti-Japanese heroes should be promoted and get rich?</p>
<p>I do not advocate "A good man should die on the battlefield" (Huang Zunxian's "Military Song"), but if a "hero" is willing to "resist Japan," then sacrificing for the country is, of course, to be expected. Fortunately, the anti-Japanese war was successful, and they escaped death. Then, retiring and seeking a profession, whether shining shoes or pulling a rickshaw, is a legitimate way to make a living, and it is indeed what a "good man" does in a bright and upright manner. What is this considered "in dire straits"? Why do they need other people's sympathy? If Jiang Minsheng and Liang Tongfang's shining shoes and pulling rickshaws are truly voluntary and not out of humble pleas or deliberately putting on a show, then the surprise of a group of petty bourgeoisie will be laughed at as "meddling in their own affairs."</p>
<p>Today, Jiang Minsheng and Liang Tongfang may already have people who "sympathize" with them and are helping them live, but if they willingly accept their help, they will be fooled and lose their original value. One or two Jiang Minsheng arouse interest, but more than ten Jiang Minsheng will cause people to be disgusted. The petty bourgeoisie never really have sympathy; they are just watching a play, looking for "special" and "fresh" stimulation.</p>

<p>— Liao Botan</p>
<p>Aunt Fushou died the day before yesterday. How did she die? Hanged herself!</p>
<p>Her tongue stuck out a foot long!</p>
<p>"A miserable person!" the villagers sighed.</p>
<p>She had relatives, wealthy relatives! In the city, the wealthy relatives didn't treat her badly. They gave her two dollars a month. Although she had to call them master and madam, Aunt Fushou didn't care. First, it was her fate; second, her son needed money to be raised!</p>
<p>She had a husband. His personality still made her doubt: the first half was as violent as a tiger, the second half as gentle as a mother to her son!</p>
<p>"We want to seek happiness!" In the second half, this often burst out of her husband's mouth. So, whenever there was money, the family would eat a big meal, eating until they had no money left, without considering that they would starve in the winter, starving so miserably!</p>
<p>In the year when the cry of soldiers not pulling laborers was loud, her husband was probably "invited" away! One "invitation" lasted ten years, and he was never seen again.</p>
<p>And Aunt Fushou had no choice but to go to her wealthy relatives' house to be a wet nurse!</p>
<p>Aunt Fushou also had sons, three or four, who all died because of poverty and disease! Fortunately, she managed to keep the last seedling for her. This year, this last seedling is sixteen years old. Marrying him a wife would complete Aunt Fushou's wish! It was also the purpose of Aunt Fushou being a wet nurse.</p>
<p>So, although she lost her husband, lost her sons, went through countless hardships, and still suffered afterward, she was not discouraged.</p>
<p>In this way, ten years passed imperceptibly in her wealthy relatives' house. She grew old! She became a little muddled in her work, and her wealthy relatives didn't like such a muddled old woman!</p>
<p>She came out. She packed her bags and returned to her hometown!</p>
<p>She didn't resent it. I can guarantee that she still wouldn't resent it even after she hanged herself. She thought: Why spend money on useless people? She even felt sorry for her previous muddleheadedness!</p>
<p>When she arrived in her hometown, her son could originally go to the city to sell vegetables every day to exchange for money, and she didn't need to bother anymore, but she had a wish! Her son hadn't married a wife yet.</p>
<p>She could weave cloth, so she opened her old, blurred eyes and wove cloth every day. Although the income from weaving cloth couldn't compare to being a wet nurse, she endured, endured, the hardship? She didn't care! The sweetness! That aftertaste.</p>
<p>The sweetness! That aftertaste.</p>
<p>Just today, the villagers carried a bamboo bed into Aunt Fushou's house.</p>
<p>"What?" She was imagining her son getting married, "The dowry?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Aunt Fushou rolled on the ground for a long time before she came to her senses.</p>
<p>"Who hit him? Who hit him? ... His… breath… is… gone!"</p>
<p>"Bandits?"</p>
<p>"Ah! My son!"</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>Late at night, Aunt Fushou went to join him in the underworld!</p>
<h3 id="e280">Bullfighting <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>Alone 丨 Especially in such a quiet night, I love to meditate: Or reminisce about past events. I stared at the golden moon lying on the forest and leisurely remembered bullfighting:</p>
<p>In my childhood, I especially loved watching bullfighting. This is one of the rural entertainments in our hometown area. Most of the wealthier families raise fighting bulls. Once the "horn opening" period arrives, the fighting bulls from the surrounding areas all gather at a designated location. There are no special bullfighting arena buildings. The bullfighting arena is just a temporarily flooded field. Before the fight, the bull owners each hire many "helpers" to lead their bulls into the field (I remember that they were led with eight red ropes). The "helpers" are all young and strong with bare feet and thighs. In this muddy field, two bulls fight head-to-head. Each pair fights once. After winning or losing, another pair is replaced. The winner will brag and trumpet as they lead the bull back; the loser will return in despair and may even chop the bull up.</p>
<p>Fighting bulls are specially used for fighting and are slightly different from ordinary working bulls: their bodies are larger than ordinary bulls, and their temperament is much more fierce. They are also given names, such as Uncle Gen, whom I remember, he once raised a fighting bull named "Yuanyang." I don't know why this bull was called "Yuanyang." I only know that this is a bull that is very good at fighting and has never lost. As the "horn opening" period approached, his life became tense: busy feeding the bull, busy going to the bull pen to drive away flies, and catching blood-sucking leeches. Often, if the child who leads the bull or his own child eats a little more food, he will scold them with his eyes wide open; but he is deeply afraid that "Yuanyang" will not want to eat. He personally mixes the ingredients, and the feed, such as wheat, soybeans, and straw, is carefully selected. Especially in the one or two days before the fight, the bull eats even better: expensive things such as dates, ginseng, and "Gansheng" (1) are given to "Yuanyang" as feed. Before the fight, some people spray opium smoke on it, saying that it can increase strength. "Yuanyang" can indeed give Uncle Gen face. Every fight is a victory, even the bull of Zhao Bopi, the richest landlord in the east of the county, is defeated miserably. It is especially embarrassing for the bull of a wealthy family to be defeated. After the defeat, Zhao Bopi sticks out his small belly and says, "Damn it, what's so rare, shameless 丨 Next time we'll compete again..." He means that the people on Uncle Gen's side used conspiracy against his bull when the two bulls were fighting, making his bull "unwilling to fight." But in fact, when Zhao Bopi sold a bull named "Shuangyajiia" for the third time and came to fight "Yuanyang," it was discovered that the "demolisher" (2) had pricked "Yuanyang" on the nose with a needle. As a result, "Shuangyajiia" still ran away: The "helpers" on both sides fought into a group.</p>
<p>It was also on such an evening: there was a golden moon and a blue sky. During the day, Uncle Gen's "Yuanyang" had defeated the bull named Zhao Bopi's fourth bull. He returned from the city slightly drunk. At the second watch, someone discovered that he had been seriously wounded with a sharp knife under a Chinese tallow tree outside the village. He fell in a pool of blood, and could still speak lowly:</p>
<p>"Zhao Bopi... Give "Yuanyang" away (3)... My descendants are not allowed to raise fighting bulls丨Not allowed... Don't make a pact with Zhao 丨 Don't be able to pay taxes丨 Don't be able to... Hurry up and give Yuanyang away..."</p>
<p>I haven't returned to my hometown for many years, and I can't help but think of watching bullfights again. It is said that Zhao Bopi is still alive, and I don't know if Uncle Gen's children and grandchildren can still follow his instructions and not raise fighting bulls.</p>
<p>(1) A kind of good yellow wine. (2) Bull and bull disease, or stop fighting, or when a bull is defeated, the "demolisher" can separate the two bulls; like a referee. (3) "Give away": Sell the bull to another family.</p>

<p>When it came time to rent the place, the rent of three thousand francs stumped him because the first term of rent had to be paid upon signing, and he had nothing, he had almost nothing on him.</p>
<p>The small fortune his father had earned only brought in eight thousand francs a year, and he himself should not have gone so long without choosing a profession, learning this and then throwing it away, and starting to learn another, often causing his parents to be very frugal. He now had to promise to reply within two days and left the house; he suddenly had an idea to wait until Zhe'an received his inheritance and talk to him about accommodating the first term of rent for three months or even half a year.</p>
<p>"This is just borrowing money for a few months," he thought, "I might be able to pay him back within the year. This is a very simple matter, and he will definitely be very happy to help me with this favor."</p>
<p>Because it was only four o'clock and he had nothing to do, absolutely nothing to do, he went to sit in the park; he sat on the wooden bench for a long time, with no thoughts in his mind, his eyes on the ground, overcome by a kind of fatigue that came from poverty.</p>
<p>But the days he had spent before, from the time he came home, he spent every day like this, and he had never felt the emptiness of life and the boredom of idleness so strongly. How exactly did he spend his days from morning to night before?</p>
<p>He strolled along the dike at high tide, strolled on the streets, strolled in coffee shops, strolled around Marlosc, strolled everywhere. This kind of life, which had always been uneventful, now suddenly aroused his disgust and made him feel embarrassed. If he had a little money on him, he would call a car to go to the countryside and circle around those ditches covered with beech and elm trees; but he had to calculate even drinking a glass of beer and buying a cent of a stamp, so naturally there was no way to realize such an idle thought. He suddenly thought about how embarrassing it was for a person over thirty to have to constantly ask his mother for a louis (equivalent to twenty francs) with a red face; he scratched the ground with his cane and mumbled:</p>
<p>"Ah! If I had money!"</p>
<p>Then the thought of his brother getting the inheritance flashed through his mind like being stung by a bee; but he didn't want to fall into jealousy, and he anxiously drove the thought away.</p>
<p>Some children were playing in the dust on the road beside him. These were all children with long golden hair, and they seemed very serious and very careful, piling sand into small mountains, and then stomping on them with one foot.</p>
<p>Bill's mood was very melancholy that day. On such days, we will think of all kinds of thoughts and search for all the inner feelings.</p>
<p>"Our labor is the same as the work of these little tricks," he thought. Then he thought that perhaps the wisest way to live was to raise two or three such useless little things and then watch them grow up with satisfaction and curiosity. The idea of getting married gently brushed in front of him. Married, no longer alone, he would not be so lonely. When our hearts are shaking, at least we can hear someone moving beside us, and when we are in pain, being able to say "you" to a woman is already not so lonely.</p>
<p>He began to think about women.</p>
<p>He really knew very few women, because he only had some half-month unions in the Latin Quarter, which would break up when the money ran out this month, and then they would reunite or find another one when there was money next month. But he thought that there were always some very pure, very docile, and very comforting women in the world. Was his home not orderly and extremely lovely because of his mother? How he yearned to know a woman, a real woman!</p>
<p>He suddenly stood up and decided to go see Mrs. Luezime.</p>

<h3 id="e283">"Stalemate" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>As I have never studied tactics, I do not know how many types there are. However, from my experience reading newspapers, I know that in terms of terrain, there are distinctions between field battles, street battles, air battles, and naval battles; in terms of weapons, there are infantry battles, artillery battles, and methods such as broadsword fighting and hand-to-hand combat. As for the term "stalemate," I have never heard of it before. It appears to have originated with the Tang-Liu battle, as reported below:</p>
<p>From Beijing, the fourth day: After the clash between Liu and Tang in eastern Chahar, the two sides have been in a stalemate for days.</p>
<p>"Stalemate" is indeed a novel term. If this term was coined by a journalist, and it most likely did not come from Sun Wu's military treatises, then the journalist's genius is truly admirable. This is because, with these three words, he not only reported the news but also conveyed the essence and nature of this and countless previous and subsequent wars, exhibiting the style of Sima Qian. I remember seeing the so-called "wheel battle" technique in novels when I was young. This involved several people taking turns fighting one person, exhausting them and making them easier to capture. Its form resembled the rotation of a wheel, both symbolically and figuratively. Those who used this tactic were often dealing with a strong enemy. Although this method had the suspicion of the many bullying the few and lacking heroic spirit, it was justifiable when facing a formidable foe. The meaning of "stalemate" is likely a derivative of "wheel."</p>
<p>However, the merits of the two can be discussed.</p>
<p>The form of a saw is one moving east and one moving west, one going back and forth, one advancing and one retreating, seemingly close yet distant, with the utmost leisurely grace. The two seem to be fighting, but in reality, they complement each other. The only thing suffering is the wood in the middle. In this orderly struggle, sawdust falls, and the parts gradually separate. As for the two sides "sawing," they can always maintain this pattern, pulling back and forth, advancing and retreating, without needing to change or facing any danger. The only thing that changes is the wood. The method of a stalemate is similar. One "aggressively attacks," then the other "retreats"; one "counterattacks," then the other "retreats again." This back-and-forth, advancing and retreating "bombardment" is no different from the form of sawing. "Wheel battles," on the other hand, are different. Although the tactic seems clever, it ultimately has the appearance of being vicious and extreme, which is not favored by refined gentlemen. In the process of the war, there is also the danger of the gears grinding on the skin or getting stuck in the mud. This is likely the reason why modern tacticians abandon the "wheel" and adopt the "stalemate" tactic. This is also an evolution of tactics. Recorded for future historians of culture to reference.</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Path to Renewal Chen Laohuai is Released from Prison <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>On the morning he left the prison, he was brought before the warden. The warden said a lot to him, teaching him to be a good person in the future and to run on the path of renewal. He must never commit crimes again. He could only look at his own belly with melancholy.</p>
<p>His body was free, but his stomach was shackled. In prison, he could work and have food to eat; but after his release, where could he find work and food? Looming before him was a dark, cold, and hideous city, its mouth wide open, ready to swallow the insignificant him!</p>
<p>He remembered the warden's words about renewing himself, and he could only force a bitter smile. How could he not know to be a good citizen? He had hands and a brain; he was born the same as everyone else!</p>
<p>Lao Huai had graduated from middle school and had even received several colorful so-called diplomas. But those pieces of paper couldn't be exchanged for food. He had lived an extremely difficult and miserable vagrant life in the city. Because he was a man, and only a middle school graduate, he could never find a job. So he had to commit crimes, using improper means to steal other people's property. Eventually, he was sentenced to six months in prison. He didn't feel much grief about going to prison. At least, in prison, he could avoid the expense of begging for a large pancake, as he had to do outside. It was something that couldn't be helped. When a person is hungry and cold, he has no ability to resist. A good will cannot bind a starving and freezing person.</p>
<p>But now he was released from prison, and the same bitter cold and pain from before would come upon him again.</p>
<p>At first, he thought of begging. Later, he felt that he could never endure the life of begging. He should find some work; he wanted to wash away the shame of his previous crimes with his strength, sweat, and blood.</p>
<p>So he wandered, unconsciously, into a store: "Is there any work for me to do? Anything at all."</p>
<p>As a result, he was kicked out.</p>
<p>The physical pain sobered him up, and he smiled bitterly. This was the suffering he should endure. He didn't have any acquaintances. Could he ask them to give him some work?</p>
<p>He wandered, unable to return to his hometown, unable to find work, unable to even get a sesame cake. Society treated him like a cat treats a mouse. He received no sympathy; he only received cruel jeers.</p>
<p>In the end, he died. He didn't check into a hotel and take sleeping pills, nor did he leave behind a grand and detailed will. He died unnoticed by society in a foul-smelling ditch. He was free from pain, and his soul received its final comfort.</p>
<p>Is death the only path to renewal for him?</p>
<h3 id="e285">Silkworm <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhu</p>
<p>"Is there any meaning to life now?" Before the question of whether people have a definite destination after death is resolved, we must first acknowledge that it is meaningful. If people truly have a definite destination after death, then life in this world is nothing more than a fleeting moment. It doesn't matter if you are born and die young because this world is not your permanent abode; you will leave it sooner or later. If people have no soul after death, and there is no permanent place to go, then we should see life in this world as extremely meaningful, and not waste a single moment. We should strive to accomplish something so that we do not waste this life.</p>
<p>But before this question can be resolved, we only have two paths to take. If you see life in this world as meaningless, then you don't need to make "passive attitude," "enjoying the moment," and "reciting Buddhist scriptures to cultivate the next life" your mantras. You might as well commit suicide because living in this world, dragging out an ignoble existence, is no different from living like a parasite. It doesn't benefit you, and it only adds another parasite to society. It doesn't matter if this person exists or not. However, the general public may be using these mantras to blind people's eyes while secretly doing things that harm life. We must not tolerate these parasites. They cannot exist, nor can we allow them to exist.</p>
<p>If you see life in this world as meaningful, then get up immediately. Whether life in this world is meaningful or not, it is like a play on a stage. There are protagonists, supporting characters, and extras in the play. On this stage of the world, no one dictates what role you play. You can be a protagonist, a supporting character, or even an extra, depending on your efforts. Then your life in this world will not be in vain. Otherwise, living aimlessly in this boring era and in this boring country is even more meaningless.</p>

<p>— Yu Gui</p>
<p>The sky is so low that it seems to be pressing down on our heads. The weather is so sultry that it's hard to believe it's late autumn after the Double Ninth Festival. The sky over Shanghai, as seen through the window, seems as if the tall buildings are about to fall. In such weather, the most likely to evoke sadness, isn't it? Warm like early spring with a gentle sun, yet without the lightness and vitality of spring, perhaps a more appropriate metaphor would be something like the plum rain season. In this room, staring blankly at the sky, is a sensitive young man with long hair, deep eyes, and a gaunt face. As if feeling some pain, he keeps his brows tightly furrowed as he looks out the window, and from morning until now, we have not seen him shift his gaze.</p>
<p>The room he occupies is a small upstairs room, with just enough space for a desk, bookshelves, and a bed. Everything in the room is piled up in a disorderly fashion, just like the thoughts of the owner of this small building at this moment. On the wall by the window hangs an enlarged half-length portrait of a young woman. She is smiling, as if recalling something pleasing, so innocent, so charming. If the young man's gaze were fixed on this photograph, perhaps we wouldn't be guessing without any reason.</p>
<p>Indeed, he raises his head, looks at the glass of the portrait, tidies his hair that has been blown forward by the wind, and suddenly smiles and walks out.</p>
<p>Outside the door is a bustling street, everything is seething. As the young man steps out, he is surrounded by a group of rickshaw pullers, but he doesn't say a word. He calmly steps over the rickshaw shaft and heads towards the quiet road without looking back. He lowers his head, his hands in his trouser pockets, his leather shoes tapping the cement blocks on the sidewalk. This kind of aimless behavior is a new attitude for him. He has been like this for the past few days.</p>
<p>He walks to a tram station, glances westward, and seems surprised that he is not planning to walk to the French Park, and laughs to himself. Perhaps he has no definite destination. He shows his pass to the Annamite policeman in front of the French Park and steps inside. Suddenly, he seems to be struck by something and stops short. The young woman in the photograph in his room is smiling and greeting him as if she has been waiting for him. Of course, he did not expect to meet her in such a place, but although he immediately returns the greeting calmly, his unnatural attitude is immediately obvious to the young woman.</p>
<p>"Wei, did you receive my letter?" the woman asks.</p>
<p>At this moment, he is holding that letter in his hand. After receiving it yesterday, he summoned his courage several times, but still did not tear it open. Now that he has met the author of the letter, he nods slyly instead of answering. The two of them walk along the path into the park, silently, as if not noticing that someone is walking beside them.</p>
<p>"Wei..." she raises her head, sees his sad face, and swallows the words she wants to say.</p>
<p>"What is it?" He is too humble because he doesn't know what she wrote in the letter. If he had a second to read the letter at this moment, he would be overjoyed. So, hearing her hesitant tone, he feels very sorry for Fei. He disguises this by asking, "Fei, how did you think to come to the French Park?"</p>
<p>"Ever since I sent the photograph to your small building, I have opened up my heart. I was originally a carefree woman, and I thought that love could never subdue me, but we have been apart for half a month, and I have been tormented by depression every day. I can't suffer like this anymore. I spend every afternoon here, but going back brings me even greater sorrow, but I can't think of any other way. I mustered my courage for three nights and wrote you that short letter, hoping that you could come here every day to walk with me. I don't have any other extravagant desires..."</p>
<p>Listening to her sobbing that she can't continue, Wei finally sees that her face is already streaked with tears. The indescribable pain in his own heart also makes him want to cry out loud, but he tries his best to suppress it and sighs, saying,</p>
<p>"Fei, when we met, I never expected that we would reach this point today. I have always wanted to see you, but who can allow us to do this? This forced situation is the same for both of us. To be honest, the letter you sent yesterday is still sealed in my pocket..." As he speaks, he takes the letter out of his pocket.</p>
<p>"Then how did you know that I asked you to meet me in the French Park?"</p>
<p>"Alright, Fei," he doesn't answer her question, but continues, "I want to move, move near you, and combine our spirits and put them to work on something. I can't bear this painful depression anymore either."</p>
<p>They both force a smile, as if their abnormal love has achieved a small result.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Where Should We Young People Go? <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhong</p>
<p>Now our young people feel that the country is suffering from internal and external troubles, with disasters following one another, and that the situation of various countries in the world rushing to compete with each other is becoming increasingly dire. This economic depression makes it easy for our young people to feel panic in their lives, for their thoughts to become polluted and depressed, for their spirit and time to be wasted meaninglessly, and for their will to waver and be buried, leading to many passive attitudes of not seeking progress and abandoning themselves. What a pity and what a terrible phenomenon! Because we young people are the future masters of the country, and the future maintainers of society. If things continue to decline like this, the country will inevitably be in even worse shape than it is now. This is also true of the world. Although the current miserable state of young people is caused by the poisonous legacy of feudal education, the unequal distribution of wealth and the unreasonable social system, and the foolish selfishness and aggressive magic of the maintainers of world society, we should also deeply investigate these causes. And what songs are popular in various countries now? They are nothing more than what industrial revival, what five-year plans and ten-year plans, what heavy tariffs on foreign goods, what protection of domestic goods and reduction of export taxes, what controls, what emphasis on the martial spirit of self-defense, what new military equipment. We dare not criticize these various declines of various countries, but simply want to expand their own power to compete for markets and plunder other people's property to remedy the lives of their own people, ignoring the overall rise and fall of the world. In short, they are still seeking revival along the old path of foolish selfishness and aggression, and not earnestly improving systems that adapt to the rational life of the times and carrying out industrial revival at the same time. I am afraid that the future results will not be optimistic. Therefore, the hope of a peaceful world is bound to be remote. If we young people harbor the idea of ​​quietly waiting for a time of peace and prosperity to realize our ideals, this is impossible. Or, as a result, we will develop passive thoughts and gradually become polluted, which is even more wrong. We young people should think about who created the world. It was not a god, nor was it a hero or a great man. It was created by the evolution of each individual's thoughts. To put it another way, who created the past economic depression? It was created by each foolish and selfish self in the past. As such, we young people should bear the responsibility of creating a future of balanced happiness and a rational social system. Do not simply blame others, but complain without a sense of responsibility. Simply put, the world cannot be created and maintained by the talents of one or two people. Happiness cannot be enjoyed solely by relying on others. It can only be obtained by the collective activities and struggles of each individual self, all bearing the responsibility of creating and maintaining society. This is what the times are telling us. We young people feel that it is necessary to eliminate all the bad habits and inferior traits inherited from feudal society, cultivate noble thoughts, a courageous spirit, and a firm will to overcome all difficulties, so that we can gradually achieve the goals of our young people's rational aspirations. Here are the attitudes we hope our young people should have now.</p>
<p>1.  Do not let panic about life pollute and depress noble thoughts.</p>
<p>2.  Do not let panic about life waste a courageous spirit and time meaninglessly.</p>
<p>3.  Do not let the fact that people with little learning in society control everything shake and bury the will to study.</p>
<p>4.  Do not retreat because of plans for vanity.</p>
<p>5.  Do not be passive because it is difficult to find work in society.</p>
<p>6.  Do not commit suicide because of the broken rivers and mountains, the difficult national steps, and witnessing tragic scenes.</p>
<p>7.  Do not be disgusted with death because of the loss of love.</p>
<p>8.  Do not hold on to feudal dreams and wait.</p>
<p>9.  Continue to pursue deep-seated thoughts of learning.</p>
<p>10. Revive the spirit of courage, reverence, and diligence in doing things.</p>
<p>11. Have a firm will to seek rational survival in a bright future.</p>
<p>12. Eliminate the bad habits and inferior traits cultivated by feudal dreams and customs.</p>
<p>13. Seek hard work to remedy real life, without shying away from thousands of hardships.</p>
<p>14. In addition to hard work, continue to read books and newspapers for a few hours every three days.</p>
<p>15. Study carefully the causes of past economic depressions in society.</p>
<p>16. Bear the responsibility of creating happiness in your own life and balanced happiness for a rational social existence.</p>
<p>In summary, we sincerely hope that our young people will never shrink back and wait quietly in difficult circumstances, because the evolution of the world never stops. Individual life cannot be delayed temporarily in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation by waiting quietly. We only allow our young people to abandon all vanity and seek a way out by working hard and making gradual progress, so that they can have a bright future. In today's society, if you don't have power, there is absolutely no chance to get anything easily, no matter what you do. Therefore, you have to create your own opportunities in difficult times. Whether you should work or farm, work hard and study at the same time. Only by having a firm will, a fighting spirit, and an individual can you achieve a life of happiness, and the country will have a day of true revival.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Life <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Wei Lao San Cooperative</p>
<p>We left our hometown one month after we got married. Our union was both old-fashioned and experienced changes within a month of the bride entering the door, forcing us to leave our hometown and throw ourselves into the embrace of Shanghai. Naturally, we had no love to speak of before marriage; after marriage, we had no honeymoon to spend. Fortunately, the law that the beginning of love in old-fashioned marriages comes after marriage did not deceive us. After escaping the oppression of our hometown and living in this small building in Shanghai, no one could believe that we were only a newly married couple of one month. Although Wei is young, she is very knowledgeable and knows the general situation. Because my initial job in Shanghai was as a newspaper reporter, I had many friends and a wide range of social activities. Wei was able to handle the people coming in and out of our small building with grace, even when I was not at home. As for household affairs, she was able to cook and sew, and she loved cleanliness. Although the small building was only three feet wide, it did not make people feel uneasy. As for our income, plain clothes and simple meals were enough to make do. It seemed that we needed a little angel between us, and Wei often looked forward to it.</p>
<p>Our union and daily life were as described above. He could be said to be outside all day, rarely having more than half a day to sit at home. I knew that he was not neglecting his love for his wife; he was living for the lives of both of us. But what does a young woman who has left her mother's arms and become a wife hope for in a lonely foreign land? A little angel, that's what I was hoping for. However, two years were added to my age record after marriage,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>and my hope was still in vain.</p>
<p>So Wei transferred her love to a kitten. Last autumn, she brought home a white cat, with only two shallow gray spots the size of copper coins on its back. Wei specially made a small quilt for it and laid it in a wooden box. Every night before going to bed, she would coax it into the room in a daze, gently pick it up, put it into the wooden box, and then she would fall asleep peacefully. Later, the kitten also knew the scheduled time. When the time came, there was no need to call it. It would obediently sleep in the wooden box, its head and limbs all curled up, its back slightly undulating, and those two shallow gray circles also rising and falling strangely, which looked very cute. Wei always clapped her hands and said, "This cat is so good!"</p>
<p>Although cats are indeed lovely animals, I love cats because they relieve my loneliness. When I have nothing to do, I hold it and play with it. Its front paws can wash its face, and it can also raise its head and ask people to kiss it. It had gone missing for two days. I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find any trace of it. She said, "I'm afraid we'll have kittens to play with." Sure enough, after it came back, its abdomen gradually expanded. I prepared everything for its birth, and this spring it gave birth to two kittens as cute as its mother. At this time...</p>
<p>At this time, after three examinations by the doctor, Wei was already pregnant, and the ardent desire for a little angel was gradually approaching reality. She forgot about the kitten's birth and made plans for the little angel, buying many cheap fabrics, wool, and even a cradle. Wei prepared everything; and at this time, the white cat disappeared with its two kittens. Did it know that it was going to lose my wife's caress, or did it no longer need human help? Two days before Double Ten Day, our little angel landed with a cry. He left his mother's womb and saw this world. He cried, what was he crying for? No one knew! Although new hope grew from the mother's heart, it could be seen that a pure little soul had entered this turbid world!</p>

<p>(I)</p>
<p>When the seasons cycle to this point, nature presents such a scene: apart from the lingering spring rain and the relatively somber and desolate suburbs, nature is vibrant and lush under the warm spring sunshine, stirring restlessness. The wheat ears in the fields sway in the spring breeze, like the soft fur under a calf, with ripples radiating a myriad of colors. Birds on the branches, welcoming the rich fragrance of flowers, flap their wings to gather the wine of spring, singing songs in subtle harmony. At this time, the men and women in the village no longer appear as withered and listless as they once did, but are all vividly working leisurely in the mountains and fields, clearly a result of the power of spring.</p>
<p>In such springs of the past, my feet would never stay still for a moment; but today is different. The reason is simple: I am now a restless, imaginative student, and, moreover, I am currently being severely punished.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was two months ago that I began to feel a little apprehensive.</p>
<p>It was the Lantern Festival night of the first month. Because my stomach was not feeling well, my mother would not let me have [unreadable character]. I was so angry that I didn't even want to eat the vegetarian meal and lay down on the bed fully clothed, quietly hearing the following conversation in the quilt:</p>

<h3 id="e291">The Daily Lives of Child Actors: They Understand Thrift and Waste Nothing; Mothers Offer Patient Guidance, Never Excessive Indulgence <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De (茂德)</p>
<p>After writing a few days ago about a lovely child in Hollywood and how Hollywood film companies protect their major actors, I felt quite interested in the lives of these child actors. Now I will write another article about the daily lives of these young actors and how they spend money, to tell ordinary Chinese children, especially those from wealthy families, to learn their thrift, benevolence, and many other virtues.</p>
<p>Speaking of these many clever and lovely children, ordinary people generally believe that their ability to dedicate themselves to the screen is a lucky and accidental occurrence. Of course, among many clever and lovely children, they alone can dedicate themselves to the screen, while there are still many other clever and lovely children who cannot. This point cannot but be attributed to fate. However, we must know that the status and fame enjoyed by these children dedicated to the screen are truly well-deserved. Among them, there are no stupid, silly, or annoying children. Therefore, this cannot be entirely attributed to fate. They each have their own genius, and once discovered, it can be said that ordinary children are far behind. Sometimes, this kind of genius is indeed something that can only be encountered by chance. Often, a company tests hundreds or thousands of children and cannot find one that is satisfactory, but accidentally encounters one that succeeds as soon as they are in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Although the appearances and actions of these child actors have spread all over the world, and they earn more money than many bankers and wealthy merchants, their parents rarely lack understanding and indulge them, fostering their arrogant and violent temperaments. Among these child stars, the most gentle and refined is David Torrence. One day, a reporter visited his mother and saw him at the door, playing with a homeless kitten. He was teaching it English. The kitten was mouse-colored and very dirty, something that ordinary children would not want, but David asked his mother, "Mother, can we keep this cat? It's so pitiful, it has nowhere to go!" David's salary averages $500 per week, which is equivalent to almost ten thousand Chinese dollars per month, but for each film he makes, his mother only gives him five dollars, and he saves all five dollars. His mother said, "David never knows how to spend money!"</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper is considered to have the highest salary among child stars. His salary is $1,300 per week, which is equivalent to more than twenty thousand Chinese dollars per month, but Jackie himself has never seen the money; his mother collects it all. In the past, his mother gave him fifty cents a week. Now that he is getting older, his allowance has recently been increased to three dollars a week, but he has to buy his own breakfast. Sometimes, the neighboring children can eat some ice cream because Jackie likes to make friends.</p>
<p>There is also Dickie Moore, who, according to his mother, is very wasteful. His mother gives him ten cents a day, but he spends it all as soon as he gets it. He still owes his mother twelve cents, and he probably owes his father fifty cents. When Dickie heard this, he seemed very embarrassed and took twelve cents from his little purse and gave it to his mother, saying, "Mother, I'm not wasteful, I'm returning your twelve cents. I talked to my father about the money I owe him, and we agreed to offset it with hugs and kisses, so I don't have to pay him back." Dickie Moore's weekly salary is $450, but when he has free time, he still wants to sell newspapers to earn some pocket money.</p>
<p>There are also many child actors who enjoyed great fame in the past. For example, Jackie Coogan, who made films for several years and earned a lot of money. Some say he had as much as five million dollars. He is now grown up and has entered university, majoring in drama. There is also David Lee, who co-starred with Al Jolson in "The Little Rascal." He was once a sensation, and theaters across the country invited him to perform on stage, earning a large salary of $4,500 per week. But he has now grown up and can no longer play children's roles. He has also entered school. He is likely to have the opportunity to return to the screen in the future, because film companies often receive requests for him to return to the screen.</p>

<h3 id="e292">"Mother's Pilgrimage" “Pilgrimage” 丨丨 Grand Theater 丨丨 <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Wu (蘼蕪)</p>
<p>▲ Introduction</p>
<p>Like Chinese films, American films have recently touched on some social issues. This is certainly a welcome phenomenon, although sometimes objective reality can be distorted by subjective consciousness. But American artists are unwilling to close their eyes and create completely unrealistic stories in their minds, which has already been proven.</p>
<p>▲ "Mother's Pilgrimage"</p>
<p>I honestly recommend this "Mother's Pilgrimage" to Chinese film practitioners and film critics. This is not to say that "Mother's Pilgrimage" is an outstanding film. I recommend this "Mother's Pilgrimage" because it is a very noteworthy film, at least in a few points.</p>
<p>The story simply says, "The son has a lover, but the mother is stubborn and does not want them to be together. She arranges for her son to go to war, where he dies. Later, she sees another couple in the same situation, their affectionate state, and greatly regrets what she did in the past, strongly advising the other couple's mother not to insist on her own views, allowing them to be together, and even welcoming her widowed daughter-in-law and grandson to live with her"!</p>
<p>Of course, this story is not for patriots, because the mother's sending her son to the army is entirely to destroy his love affair. This story is realistic, but it is conceptualized. Because it does not explain the essence of this kind of fact, but only explains the regret of personal emotions, it is not enough. And the reason why I specifically recommend this film to practitioners is first of all because this film is set in the countryside. There are too many Chinese films with a rural background. I hope our practitioners will look at other people's films with a rural background. Secondly, Chinese films, which feel narrow in subject matter, should expand in other directions. A story like "Mother's Pilgrimage" is one way. (Of course, I don't want to completely copy it.)</p>
<p>Now I will write down some of the techniques of screenwriting and directing.</p>
<p>First, the young man returns from the field, panting heavily, and it is obvious that the work is too tiring, so the mother tells him to rest. But as soon as the mother walks away, he is eager to see his lover, running quickly without any tiredness. This is a very real and detailed depiction.</p>
<p>Second, the young man goes to his lover's house at night, and the mother opens the window and looks out because the dog barks. She sees him because the dog and the young man have been close before, so the dog barks as the young man walks away. This is extremely reasonable!</p>
<p>Third, the mother makes him go to war because she does not approve of the young man's actions. Therefore, when the news of the young man's death in battle arrives, her grief is not deep. She only goes to the room and puts the already torn photos back together to look at.</p>
<p>Fourth, when the young man goes to war and gets on the train, his lover sees him off. After the scene of the train leaving, there is a close-up of the lover's face. At this time, he adds the sound of the train. The sound of the train wheels goes from slow to fast, and her facial expression goes from normal to tragic. With a whistle, tears burst out, and the sound of the whistle goes from near to far, and the picture slowly "fades in." The whistle finally cannot be heard, and the picture also fades to nothing. This combination of sound and image is used very appropriately, allowing the audience's visual and auditory senses to feel it at the same time!</p>
<p>Fifth, he uses chickens and dogs as intermissions in the story, which are not just decorations, but are simply related to the plot. The second point above has already explained this.</p>
<p>Sixth, he tightly grasps the mother's personality and develops the story. Before the mother regrets it, he always portrays the mother as an extremely strong woman. Even after the regret, her actions are extremely firm, without much hesitation.</p>
<p>Seventh, the flashback scenes are used appropriately. At the same time, not only is the light in the flashback scenes different from the general scenes, but the flashback scenes also flash by extremely quickly and without stopping, so that people know at a glance that this is a flashback.</p>
<p>Eighth, he writes the mother's regret, which must be at the time of going to France to pay tribute, on the day of seeing a couple in the same situation. This is different from unconditional and immediate realization.</p>
<p>Enough, I have listed eight noteworthy points. Finally, I should also say that the actress's performance is also good.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Review of "Striving for Success" The Man Who Dared 丨Fox Production Nanjing Premiere丨 <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He (凌鹤)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a movie story that is stretched out too long often makes people feel scattered and disorganized. "The Turbulent Times" which was recently premiered, also had a lengthy story. From 1800 to the end of the Great War in 1918. However, because of the success of the director, and all the staff were very cautious, the evaluation of that film did not ignore other technical advantages because of the length of the story.</p>
<p>This film "Striving for Success" also has a lengthy story. From the end of the American Civil War in 1871, to three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, extended for more than sixty years. Because so many years of facts have to be performed in a few thousand feet of film, on average, each paragraph can only occupy a small part of the film very simply. Moreover, because the director is not good at handling it, we only see very fragmented details in this film, and we can never find a more detailed description.</p>
<p>We are not saying that long stories are always unacceptable, but that a central point must be grasped and developed as much as possible, and unnecessary parts should only help the development of the central point. Now we may as well study the screenwriting.</p>
<p>In this film, it is very obvious that the author wants to exaggerate the existence of democratic politics as much as possible. Therefore, the playwright explained that the protagonist, John, followed his poor parents to the United States as an immigrant when he was very young. His father died in a mine explosion, and he himself became a miner after growing up. However, because of the encouragement of his parents and his own bravery and perseverance, he finally became the mayor of Chicago from a worker. Finally, he was mistakenly killed by thugs who assassinated the president, replacing the president's disaster. Since the theme is to explain the rationality of so-called democratic politics, there is no need to write about this so-called brave man from sixty years ago. At most, the playwright only needs to explain that John's father was a miner and had great hopes for his son. Then, I think it is enough to start writing about his future aspirations and achievements, starting from the time his father heard the whistle at breakfast and went to work, and died in the mine after encouraging him. At the same time, it is more important to focus on when he achieved his success, and it is not impossible to relax after he achieved it. There are many paragraphs in the middle that can be abandoned, such as marrying a younger sister and giving birth to a daughter. At least these key points can be mentioned in conversations. In particular, the speeches and interviews with reporters in the last few paragraphs are even more dull because the dialogue is too long.</p>
<p>The director used many "fades in" and "fades out", making people feel very fragmented. However, some dissolves are still interesting. The playwright is like this, and the director is also like this, so this ordinary movie is formed.</p>
<p>In addition, the performers do not show anything that makes people excited. The male protagonist plays from youth to old age, and there is no change in age shown in the actions. Especially when he is old, he feels even more like a failure. However, the actors who play John's parents are relatively impressive, although there are not many scenes, they give people a sense of reality.</p>
<p>It is natural for Americans to exaggerate the democratic politics that are popular in the United States in this way. However, whether a worker can really achieve success in this way, I hope we don't have such delusions. However, the author's attempt is ridiculous after all. Especially after the crazy "The West Wing", there are such works appearing, which makes us feel that the American film industry is really strange.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Review of "Ubangi" 丨New Light Screening丨 <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Moore (摩爾)</p>
<p>The significance of beast movies has been correctly pointed out by many film critics. Of course, it is nothing more than encouraging the public to develop the frontiers and satisfying people's curiosity.</p>
<p>Originally, if beast movies used the method of newsreels, without adding a story, and only introduced the living conditions of wild beasts, it would not be impossible to increase some knowledge for those backward areas and people who do not have zoo facilities. Unfortunately, they insist that every beast movie must lead to a tasteless story.</p>
<p>"Ubangi" is also this kind of movie. Its characteristic is just that it makes its role more complete. It seems like in the middle:</p>
<p>(1) Black people lick the fat from the bones of beasts.</p>
<p>(2) Black people steal and drink the animals' drinking water.</p>
<p>(3) White people whip black people to make them obey orders.</p>
<p>All are trying to depict the black people as foolish, obedient, and deceptive. Not only that, he also wrote that white people give black people Western clothes to wear, and reward them with thunder, to deepen their deception. I remember half a year ago, several beast movies ended with a most loyal and hardworking black man, wearing Western clothes, happily dining with white people in the dining room of a large steamship. The reason is too clear.</p>
<p>The first thing a "beast movie" needs is tension, because wild beasts are indeed very fierce. At the same time, it is not enough to satisfy the curious audience without extreme tension. Therefore, "King Kong" and the like do not hesitate to use photography techniques to increase its tension and horror, but this "Ubangi" is too relaxed. The reason is that the "wild beasts" are not made to act. This is of course the director's responsibility.</p>
<p>In terms of shots, close-ups are used too little, so that the audience does not pay much attention to the "wild beasts". It is also wrong to pay attention to the soft and beautiful scenery as much as possible, without paying attention to the steep mountains. Because this can also make the film relax.</p>
<h3 id="e295">The Literary Film Feast Is Hard to Repeat Dinner at Eight (10) <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Teng (馬騰)</p>
<p>Paula's face was pale and her expression absent. She wanted to talk to her mother, but Mrs. Millicent Jordan was too busy to care about her daughter's trivial matters. Her husband said he was also sick, which made her even angrier. She said to her husband, "You're sick? Do you know what I'm like? Today is the first day I've felt better! The servants fought and broke up, the doorman was arrested, and today I have to find a newsroom. The vegetables are ruined again, and today I can only use canned crab meat. What's even more outrageous is that the Flickertons aren't coming! Those two old fossils just called to say they've gone to Florida! You're sick! I'm the one who should be lying in bed! I'm really suffering! Neither of you knows!" After she finished speaking, she walked away in a fit of anger. Oliver and Paula, father and daughter, looked at each other, too scared to say anything, and had to go and change their clothes.</p>
<p>It was long past eight o'clock. The Packards and the Talbots had also arrived. Relatives who were not invited in advance but were brought in to make up the numbers had also arrived. Millicent rallied her spirits and greeted them, not showing any signs of anger. She announced to Packard that the Flickertons were not coming, saying that Lord Flickerton had contracted a sudden illness and had to be sent to Florida immediately. Packard glared at his wife, with indescribable pain in his heart. Millicent took the couple to join the Talbots. Packard and Talbot talked happily about golf and horseback riding. But what about Paula? What about Oliver? What about Larry Renault? What about Carlotta Vance? Could this meal be eaten? When could it be over? She thought listlessly. Finally, she ordered them to have cocktails first.</p>
<p>Oliver came in? His face was green and white. He had just had a sudden attack. Talbot used first aid methods and saved him. Millicent looked at him with infinite tenderness when she saw him. How ashamed she was for scolding him mercilessly just now. Dear Oliver, his illness had already been explained to her by Talbot. How could she leave such a kind, patient, and sweet husband? She decided that after Paula and Ernest were married, she would go to another place to recuperate. Ernest had already arrived, and Millicent greeted him. But what about Paula?</p>
<p>Paula's maid secretly told Mrs. Jordan that Paula was not in her room. Where had she gone? But she had already gone out. A tragic "goodbye" on the phone made her rush to Larry Renault's hotel. When she arrived, countless people were surrounding Larry's door. The door had already been broken down. Suddenly, someone grabbed her hand and pulled her into a room next door. It was Carlotta Vance. Paula cried out madly, "Let go, let go, let me go! Why are you holding me! I want to see him; I can save him!" (To be continued)</p>
