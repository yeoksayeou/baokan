<p>但離心傾向。則爲無可諱言之事實。新疆幾占全國全面積八分之一。西藏則鑛藏豐富。皆爲我國未來之寳庫。則當前事變。詎容忽視然而返顧國内情形。本部農村。破敗過甚。社會亦困疲不堪前途之希望少人皆僅顧目前。得過且過。而所謂救濟又迂緩特甚不能濟當前之急。更不能激發大衆對未來之希望。於黑暗中開闢新前途。指明路向更有甚者。荷國家將來重任。現時在學中之靑年。亦多同流合污。不能以少數之正確。糾正多数數人一時朦昧之過失乃亦醉生夢死。躭暫時之歡樂。忘百年之禍患。故敵人得以肆意侵略。橫行無忌也。</p>
<p>今後英美諒解。如果成立。資本主義國際協作。或有相當功用。對日將限於經濟的競爭。武力侵華之暴行。不免愈烈。蘇聯爲貫串其傳統的和平外交起見。對日必保持已往關係於是在國際間。我國將愈陷於孤立。雖道德上援助之呼聲。亦將低落。然則我將何如曰惟有振奮精神。盡所有一切能力以　自力之更生而已。</p>

<p>世界經濟會議不致受影響美對軍縮仍維持獨立行動</p>
<p>國民十三日華盛頓電今日美政府要人通知國會、羅斯福總統業已抛棄請國會授權修改戰債或獲致妥協之意、因此美政府已將使美國在世界經濟會議中易於進行之一問題、直接付諸國會處决、而國會議員或將有數人出席倫敦會議、按英美要人咸認欲謀倫敦會議之完全成功、必須對於戰債獲得一種諒解、但苟非美國會自行建議一種解决方式、則恐在經濟會議期内未必能同時加以切實討論、照目前情形則美國代表勢將不能自提解决計劃、祇可靜聆他國之提議矣、至今日美政府要人之通知國會、則適在美國務卿被迫將美總統自覺對於戰債不能担負任何干係等情告知法大使賴蒲萊之後、據聞法國曾提議補繳十二月愆期欵、但以美國宣告緩付六月到期欵爲條件、而美國務卿遂告以美總統無權担負任何干係、蓋總統雖曾明白請國會對於修改成緩付戰債正式表示意見、但至今未曾照辦、國會内頑强反對修改一派曾有所表示、顧此事迄未提出會塲、美政府固知出席倫敦會議代表若未獲就廣大基礎討論戰債之權力、將處困難地位、然設令美總統請國會授以解决戰債權力而遭失敗、則實際更將爲難故不若不請國會授權之爲愈、至美國會此態度、當不致使倫敦會議失敗、據美國務卿赫爾今日表示、倫敦會議之主要目的預料在兩月内即可達到、一俟會議中校大各問題獲有决議後、渠信匯兌立可安定、貿易障壁立可消除不少而國際間感情亦可有顯著之進步、但赫爾更希望軍縮僵局、能於倫敦會議開幕以前解决、因欲在經濟上獲</p>
<p>得完全同意、必須先行消除國際間之猜</p>
<p>疑也、當時有人詢問赫爾萬一德國堅持軍備上立即完全平等權、致協約國援用凡爾賽和約中之制裁時美國亦將加入否、赫爾答稱美國非凡　賽和約之簽約國、故美國不必照其規定行事、今日又有美政府其他要人評論軍縮會議之僵局、謂美國不參加協約國與德國間之糾葛、但切實反對德國重行大規模武裝、因當此各國方注意於減縮軍備之際、若允德國重行武裝致國際形勢有益加緊張之　、實非智者所爲吾人顴此兩種表示、足見美國對於軍縮仍將獨立行動、但其行動可與協約國大致相同云、</p>

<p>以過去歷史看、英國據世界金融王座其自尊自大的心理、確有「太陽不落」的氣槪、然則牠對於意大利儘可以電致黑衣宰相、請他到倫敦去面談、何必親自枉駕羅馬呢、殊不知英國肩着「世界和平的大旗、同時也是爲了英國的安全、於是麥唐納氏奮起頒白的頭髮不惜獻身精神、調和歐洲的紛亂：：：」英首相旣勞駕相就、則意大利人自然是表示歡迎、「當維持世界和平之任的只有我們兩人、」「現世界差不多有一大半是統一於墨索里尼主義之下」的豪語、充分的表現出意大利人的熱情也多少顯露一點牠們的妄想、實際上這兩位宰相見面、談話的詳細内容究竟如何到現在還是嚴守秘密但是他們談話的中心問題、必爲改訂凡爾賽和約、」則大都後有疑義、</p>
<p>自從希特勒組閣而後、德意志奪還戰後失地運動、漸趨猛烈、并且日見具體化、而締結凡爾賽和平條約、當時意大利所得又很有限、所以好大喜功的墨索里尼早就胸懷不平、於是對於處於困境的希特勒、纔互相携手、而追隨德意志之後的有奥匈等國、另一方面則以法蘭西爲盟主、附集其下的是波蘭·捷克·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞等、這兩個集團相互對立、孕育着第二次世界大戰的危機、英國首相見到這種危險、想要講求和平手段、脫離危機的途徑只有使「不平者」得到幾分的利益纔能滿足這是很明白的事實果然倫敦Ｅｖｅｎｉｎｇ　ｓｔａｎｄａｒｄ就登載麥墨兩氏會面之内幕、他們對於「凡爾賽和約」所提出修正的内容大體如下、（一）把波蘭廊下地、横切一塊從西波蘭的城市孔尼克（ＣＢＯＪＮＩＣｅ）至東普魯士的馬林威達市（Ｍａｒｉｅｎｗｅｒｄｅｒ）　一帶的地方、作爲德國的廊下地帶并由德國敷設鐡道、</p>
<p>（二）羅馬尼亞把以前從匈牙利割來的托蘭斯文利亞（Ｔｒａｎｓｙｌｖａｎｉａ）和巴納特（Ｂａｎａｔ）兩處地方讓予匈牙利、</p>
<p>（三）南斯拉夫也把以前佔據匈國的巴納特地域、凡在多腦河與特斯河（ＴＢＥＩＳＳ</p>
<p>ＲＩＶＥＲ）兩江之間、在南流交點處、讓還與匈牙利</p>
<p>（四）南斯拉夫把舊時奥國的克勒茵地方（ＫＲＡＩＮＢＵＲＧ）讓還给奥國、</p>
<p>（五）現在南斯拉夫所兼併的克洛提亞（</p>
<p>ＣＲＯＡＴＩＡ）古國、任其獨立、</p>
<p>（六）達爾馬其亞南岸（ＤＡＩＭＡＴＩＡ）如赫爾捷哥維亞（ＨＥＲＺＥＧＯＶＩＮＡ）門的内哥（</p>
<p>ＭＯＮＴＥＮＥＧＲＯ）等地方、須從南斯拉夫分離而併合於亞爾巴尼亞、（ＡＬＢＡＮＩＡ）并置諸意大利保護之下、而爲一緩衝國家、</p>
<p>這一提案、如果實現的話、則德總統與登堡元帥回他的故鄕東普士時、可以不必再受越他人國境的恥辱、只經德國迴廊就可以回去了、意大利多年野望着北非的覇權、和達爾馬其亞沿岸的支配權從北即可收歸掌握、不過南斯拉夫又怎樣呢、而且在國際的均勢中、意大利勢力加重了、法蘭西自不免減輕、英相又先到意大利去、法國當然表示不快所以法國對四强會議表示不滿、以爲那是大戰以前的强國主義現在該以國聯爲中心採取開明的國際民主、即使以强國爲本位、也要把足以與意大利匹敵的波蘭請來纔合理、同時波蘭還不願依賴法國、所以波外長白克於四月一日訪捷克外長其後又往南斯拉夫的卜拉格與其外長密商、這就是小協約國反强國的發端、并且又盛傳蘇聯與波蘭之間將成立某種密約則歐洲大陸的紛糾還是方興未艾、德國縱然稱讚英國是「白人的救世主」、英相又以和平目的而赴羅馬、如上述提案果確實施行、恐怕更會激起歐洲各國的爭鬥、增加人心的不安、（四月十日於羅馬）</p>

<h3 id="c81">中日關稅協定失效 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>今日期滿自然廢止明日起照徵新稅率</p>
<p>中日關稅互惠協定、至五月十五日（今日）適屆滿期我政府當局已一再聲明、該協定屆期、自然廢除、毫無疑問、現海關當局、、已奉財政部命令、自明日（十六）起、</p>
<p>對日貨改徵新稅、茲誌各情如左、</p>
<p>恊定原因　我國自遜清以迄北洋政府時代、關稅權旁落、操諸外人手中、致外貨稅率低微、得以盡量向我國傾銷、我國人民之財力、被外人剥削數十年、致國勢日弱、民力日蹙、國府奠定南京後、開始交涉收回關稅自主、各國俱無異言、而日本則堅持交換條件、故成立該中日關稅互惠協定、仍得以低稅保持日貨傾銷之權利、惟爲期訂定三年、至本年五月十五日、即告滿期我政府以首在收回關稅自主權、故暫時訂立該約、</p>
<p>滿期廢止　該約迄至今日（五月十五）</p>
<p>爲滿期之日、各界民衆團體、及國貨工商界方面、早經通電勿再續訂、而我政府方面亦决意任其滿期時自然廢止、不再續商日人方面、初意頗欲與我國繼續商談、俾使延長期限、以期繼續傾銷日貨、本埠日商人僑民、於月前曾開會要求彼國政府、與我接洽、企圖苟延、惟以條約所載、無繼續可能、而我國態度異常堅决、故不得不聽其自然、屆時廢止無效、　　日貨趕運　日人鑒於我國無意賡續此項協定、故爲補救萬一計、曾儘五月十五日以前、竭力趕運日貨來華、傾銷市塲、以收最後之孤注、故上兩月内日貨之運輸來華其數實堪驚人、其原因半爲我方抵制而作减價傾銷計、半則因互惠協定廢止在即、不得不趕先裝運來華、避免被徵新稅、　　即徵新稅　財政部因政府决意任該約滿期廢止、故已經訓令海關稅務各機關、自五月十六日（明日）起、依照二十年一月一日所頒新稅則、徵日貨進口稅率、其被徵日貨之新稅種類、以布匹海鮮魚介等類、計共四十餘種云、聞同時徵收海關及水災兩種附加稅云、</p>

<p>便利交通改良農業其他須到任後再定朱定月内西上履新</p>
<p>新任甘肅省政府主席朱紹良氏、前日由京飛滬、定於月内赴甘履新、中央社記者、昨日往訪朱氏於其寓邸、訽以甘省之現狀及治甘之方針等各項問題、當承詳爲答復如下、</p>
<p>甘肅近况　記者首詢朱主席甘肅近况若何、朱氏答稱該處余未到過、故政治社會等實情非所　悉、惟在京曾與前主席邵力子氏晤及、藉悉該地情形其地蕴藏至富惜多未經開發、人民務農爲多兼營畜牧、故其出產、除工業原料如棉花等外、羊毛獸皮之年產額、爲數亦鉅、惟以交通不便運費奇昂、故日就衰微耳且今年旱魃爲災田產銳減、亦對折減收故財政情况自甚困難、惟尙能收支相敷、暫維現狀、甘省交通甚爲不便、其唯一幹路、爲西安至蘭州之汽車路、長千一百里、以兵工趕築僅掘平路基、絕無公路之規模、邵主席主政時、曾計劃修築、改鋪路面、大約六七月間可以告成、</p>
<p>開發西北　朱氏繼語記者、現在中央對於開發西北、甚　爲重視、人民對之亦甚感與趣但欲求發展、必先開闢公路、便利交通、蓋一切建設、必須新式機械、如無便捷之交通工具、則不能輸入多量之機械也、農業之改良、中央已派專家前往調查計劃、且年前旱災、曾輸入灌漑引擎數具、惟以資力及交通關係、未能儘量採用、而欲求農業之發展、墾荒造林、亦爲重要設施、記者旋詢邵主席前在滬曾邀金融界巨子、談商投資開發西北事、是否將再作進一步之接洽朱氏答、甘省交通如能改善、則各界必樂往開發、無須接洽、故開發首要、、實在交通問題</p>
<p>施政方針　記者旋請朱氏發表對於治甘之方針、朱氏謂在本人尙未到甘之前、尙談不到</p>
<p>所謂施政方針、蓋旋政方針、不能離社會而空談須視社會之情形如何而後定、本人目前對於甘省情形、不甚熟悉、故對於施政方針亦未有所决定、至於甘省政府各廳長人選一仍其舊、並無更動、</p>
<p>月内赴甘　朱氏此次來滬、係料理私事、據談本週内即須返京、有所商洽、並將赴贛一行、晋謁蔣委員長、月内當可首途赴甘履新、</p>

<p>我國旅墨被逐華僑、先後回國者、已有四千餘人、現留有前日（十二日）回國之被難代表黃竹林·林文禮·林惠耀三君、在滬進行各項救濟事宜昨日共發表談話、照誌如左</p>
<p>感謝援助　難僑於前日（十二日）乘胡佛總統船抵滬、蒙上海全球華僑總公會、特派總幹事彭燦光君等、親到船上、先致慰問後領導全體難僑登岸、欵以餐宿外、復賜助每人現洋十元、該華僑總會不特能爲華僑參加實際工作、而且其主幹人員、辦事之精神、無間日夜殊屬可偑此次該會伍主席澄宇、親自招待、郭主席順、又親到新關碼頭、監督一切、致難僑等感激之餘、更全體一致加入該會以示竭誠擁戴此次并蒙上海輿論界盡量宣傳、於救濟交涉均能收偉大之効力、裨益於難僑前途實非淺鮮、又得上海市長華僑總會名譽主席吳鐡城同志、首先代募一千元、以供救　濟、但是吳市長實爲此次發起救濟難僑之原動力、同人謹代表全體難僑掬誠申謝、</p>
<p>留滬目的　墨西哥被難華僑、已被驅逐回國者、約有四千餘人、而將來陸續返國者、尙有四倍以上、（約二萬人）若非設法維持、何以善其後、故難僑等以上海爲我國經濟政治中心、特推派同人（代表三人）留住滬濱、以期在全球華僑總公會領導之下、進行各種需在工作、如請求各界救濟、曁督促政府交涉等、此爲代表等留滬之目的也、</p>
<p>組會維持難僑人數旣多、一旦回國若非預謀整個救濟方法、則此輩難僑非變爲乞丐、即留爲盗匪、實屬危險、中央政府雖日言設法救濟、然墨國排華、已有二年之歷史、尚未見有如何實際辦法、是政府對難僑、未免漠視太甚、此爲事實之表現并非苛責政府也、吾人亦深知政府處於國難時期自有苦衷、吾人所希望於政府者、旣無辦法</p>
<p>、惟有力謀自救、由自己想出辦法、請政</p>
<p>府帮忙、此吾人爲切身利害關係、有亟須</p>
<p>組會維持之必要也</p>
<p>請求救濟　華僑素來對祖國革命公益等事業莫不盡力輸將、人所共見、不容多贅、此次我旅墨華僑、不幸遭此巨患、厥狀至慘、有家難歸、惟有請求國内慈善大家、曁扣界同胞鼎力救濟、更希望黨國要人、飲水思源、予以物質上之援助、以解除數萬旅墨難僑之痛苦、而資以有效力之善後方半、不特裨益於難僑個人之本身、而於國體方面亦有相當關係也、</p>
<p>排華遠因　墨國排華、起於民國二十年六月十二日主、動最力者爲該國國會議員萬奴氏、ＭＡＮＵＥＳＡＬＡＺＡＲ由萬氏領導一般無業流氓、兼失業工人、組織排華黨、自兼該黨主席之一、其實此次墨國之鼓動排華實含有經濟及政治之作用、而墨政府乃爲操緃及策劃排華之原動力也、關於經濟方面我僑胞在墨國商務上農業上、確均占有絕大勢力、不特墨政府及人民、咸加妒忌、而各國僑墨外人、（如日本人等）亦萌競爭及搶奪之心、而當時墨國士人、又因世界經濟影響失業日衆、關於政治方面墨國政治素稱複雑、中央與地方下府輒生意見、而排華親華、主張不一、親華派執政則旅墨僑胞、當可当居樂業、若排華派得權、則任意壓迫、驅逐凌虐、無所不至、善省順省乃該國之重要省份、華僑商業農業均薈萃於斯、舉凡有排華事件發生、均以順善而省僑胞受創最深、是該兩省、不爲排華策源地也、此爲墨國排華之遠因、</p>
<p>排華近因　自墨國發動排華以來、經過若干時間之敎訓、我政府除採用空頭方式交涉外、絕無其他有效力辦法、以致墨國朝野上下人士、均啓輕視之心、由輕視而擅動、由擅動而凌虐無所顧忌、政府倡之、人民和之、於是演成極有秩序之排華運動、最近旣因我國失去東北、墨國朝野、更爲藐視、變本加歷、本年　月一日、適爲排華派萬氏ＭＡＮＵＥＬＰＡＩＸ就任善省長、由是而排華空氣、高漲萬分、排華黨則四出活動、爲所欲爲此爲、墨國排華之近因也、　　備受痛苦　自排華復興以後、我旅墨僑胞、在順善兩省、絕對不能立足、墨政府一面對華儒施行最嚴格之排華政策、尤其對華商限制爲世界未有之苛例、每一華僑商店十人中至少須雇用墨國工人八人、不特此也商業稅由十元增至一百元、華商當然不能曲受此種無理之苛例、我外交當局旣限於勢力、不能交涉取銷、惟有自動將所存貨物拍賣平沽此種損失以數千萬計、墨政府又一面唆使排華黨、將僑胞之財物及册紙、（即居留證）盡量搶刧、而墨政府又一面下令藉口保護外僑、一律檢騐册紙、殊不知華僑之册紙早爲排華黨搶奪以去矣、於是發生「無權居留」之恐慌、而各該地之警察當局、同時奉令拘捕、無册紙之華人、此旅墨華僑、曁遭財産之損失復被非法逮捕驅逐、施此毒辣手段、以使旅墨僑胞受其有形及無形之痛苦也　　偷渡入美　　我僑胞目覩墨政府之殘忍手段、爲避免危險起見去家逃亡、偷渡入美、而美國政府、亦早知旅墨華僑、此次偷渡入美之不得已苦衷、尙能本人道主義資助川資、遣送回國、實感謝萬分及返至我國、所謂最大都會之上海、除華僑總公會發起救濟、及吳市長居中贊助外、其餘政府及各機關團體、均漠不關心、言之實可痛恨、茲華僑總會旣發起救濟、并委托上海華僑銀行、（九江路九號）總理代收欵項、希望海内外各界、鼎力輸將玉成義舉、以期集腋成裘、救濟此數萬無辜之難僑、則同人拜謝多矣、</p>

<p>五月十日在靑年會議</p>
<p>二，五三慘案和中國的内政</p>
<p>日本對付中國的政策，一向運用和是挑撥離間助長内戰使中國不統一的一途。從袁世凯帝制起始，而張勳復辟，而安福再起，而直皖奉直戰事而郭松齡事件，而大沽口事件，每次的内爭都有日本的陰謀參加在内。所不同的五三以前日本籠絡中國軍閥只有一個，五三以後籠絡多個，形成中國軍閥羣雄割據的局面，這已見帝國主義侵略方法的進步了。五三以後他們不但籠絡多個中國的軍閥，並能隨時隨地拉攏或拒絕中國的各軍閥；或許今天勾結甲軍閥打倒乙軍閥，明天却勾結乙軍閥打倒甲軍閥；這種反覆無常的手段的施用是對於他們更有利。五三以後日本尤看重中國反動勢力的消長，他們設法要籠絡這種勢力，煽動他使他們更擴大，而至於蔓延全國，所以日本對於中國的官僚政客買辦階級也代替了軍閥的武力而看重起來│從此他們知道深入中國的大衆層去尋找他們侵略的機會。這是一個重大的轉變。</p>
<p>三，五三慘案和中日外交</p>
<p>袁世凯雖承認日本的二十一條件，但經過華盛頓會議的討論二十一條不能完全實行。五三時候開始日本更認爲除去政治的經濟的侵略以外更需要武力的侵略。恰巧不景氣已見了端倪，同時日本國同内狀况也有利於　武主義的抬頭，因此日本軍閥就决业對華採取直接的軍事侵略。</p>
<p>第二點便是從五三時候開始，日本的對華外交專以「地方事件」搪塞，使發生的問題成爲一個懸案，漸漸又受了他的欺蒙而把權利攫奪了去。這種手段的施用是使列强没有話可說，自已則坐享其利。濟南慘案以來的九一八事件，錦州山海關，熱河乃至最近的察哈爾戰爭，他們都拿渺小的「地方事件」這一名目來解决的！</p>
<p>這是五三慘案對於中日外交上的影響。</p>
<p>四，　五三慘案與國際</p>
<p>五三慘案以前，日本侵略中國的態度表面上是採取和列强協調的，主張門户開放，機會均等；但是五三後却公然放棄和合作，取孤立的態度。</p>
<p>國民革命軍的北伐，曾惹起列强的膽寒，在華外艦都向南京的江而開砲。但是英國早就在表面上對華妥協了，美國因無具體的政治勢力，非但不加阻止中國的革命，反與新興的革命勢力處處妥洽。這一次的外艦開砲英美等艦都開的是空砲，而日艦則裝實了子彈使勁地開的！英美各國對於中國的關稅自主都予一種原則上的承認，表示他們的好感；而日本則一味刁滑，没有確切的表示。日本所處立塲的孤立，這是很明顯的。濟南的進兵，便是表明日本帝國主義的苦衷，也是表明自命帝國主義領袖的輕視别人表揚自已的獨斷獨行的威武。這種企圖他們在後來看到國民革命是一個强有力的運動的時候，也希望能够憑藉示威的手叚而得到一點交換的利益。　　我們知道，日本的兩大敵人，一個就是和自已相角逐和資本帝國主義國家的英美│尤</p>
<p>其是美國，另一個就是社會主義國家的蘇俄。日本出兵，東的另一個目的，就是在偵察中國的國民革命運動中有没有他們認爲兩大敵人的勢力參加在内，或是單純的只是一種民族革命。這一次他們確認中國革命是一種民族革命，他們就知道對付美國是他們當前的急務，而不在於反俄。但是九一八以後日本似乎對付俄美舉棋不定就是因爲帝國主義内在的矛盾自從五三以來更是深刻化了。</p>
<p>這是五三在國際上的意義。</p>
<p>我們認淸五三在歷史上的意義以後，就應該得到兩個訓：</p>
<p>第一，日本希望我們不統一，我們自已當眞不統一，這是自已不爭氣。但是中國的民衆是統一的，。中國内部的許多分裂，爭奪都是統治者的過失。我們因此感覺政權脫離民衆就不能革命</p>
<p>第二是中國對外的不抵抗，也是統治者的過失；我們民衆是一向主張並且實行抵抗的，九一八後的東北義勇軍的蜂起，一二八時的民衆援助的熱烈，都是表示民衆都有一致對外的决心。我們因此更感覺政權脫離民衆，就不能革命！</p>
<p>我們現在所紀念的國恥不是民衆的恥辱，而是政府的恥辱！民衆自已應該起來謀統一，謀抵抗！爲全世界的弱小民族呐喊！爲全世界的文化奮關！（葉文雄記）</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>我社會人士應注意近代科學之驚人現狀</p>
<p>回顧我們中國。行軍時候。連鍋灶也感缺乏。即使有汽油空筒。恐怕要做戰壕上的掩蔽物。未必能拿來蒸衣服呢。　　第四天第三題講的是熱帶腫瘍。（癌瘤疽等等）。除却各種腫痬的說明。並用幻燈表演各項腫瘍的病人爲證。大都是由非洲印度各處採集。的因此我覺得中國也有許多癌腫患者。却蟄處在鄕僻之區。尙没有醫藥的地方。就缺少人去研究他了。　　此外又表演一種電影。是癌細胞的分裂狀况。和平常細胞增殖分裂各狀。這種影片。是在顯微鏡中攝取。謂之「襲取攝影法」。因爲細胞的分裂。實際上不比細菌的動作。假如照他的天然快慢攝影。那麽我們要在影片中看明白他的動作。豈非要拍攝一張數小時長久的影片麽。所以這種影片。是逐段攝取細胞動作最活潑的狀態。而啣接成爲影片。在銀幕上看起來。祇要十分鐘。便見細胞已由一個變二個二個。變四個了。諸位平常看電影。可以看見跑馬的姿勢。運動的形狀。用攝影的方法。使他變成極慢的動作。那麽反過來狠緩慢的過程。自然也可以用這種接片的方法。變成狠快的動作了。　　細胞分裂情形。用俗語來解說。簡直就是「生瘤如何生成」的狀態。或者「長皮肉如何長成」的情形。這種事實。都能用方法送到我們眼裏來。可算得眞憑實據。顚撲不破的學術。此外尙表現些肌肉受電流以後。那肌肉抽搐時候的細胞。如何顫動的情形也是很有價値的。附帶放映絲帶與眼科網絡膜病的情形。</p>
<p>第五天第四講題。是論阿苗巴（原蟲）痢疾以後的誤診。及其治療證明這一類痢疾。如果治療不澈底。到後來發生出種種病象來。如便閉腹痛肝臟化膿精神病貧血不一而足的枝節。而那時候的症象。與痢疾相去甚遠。醫者往往失辨。但是結果則數年痼疾、竟可因驅除阿苗巴原蟲。而達治愈之目的惟檢查粪便。以斷定是否曾患阿苗巴痢疾的方法。非常要仔細單靠病人的口述。是靠不住的。因爲竟有許多病人。僅僅患過一二次泄瀉。毫非痢疾症象。而其病根。竟也是阿苗巴原蟲。</p>
<p>這一個演題。非常切要。我們知道。在上海。和南方各省。一年夏秋之間患痢疾的。不知凡幾。而這種痢疾。何嘗個個能夠達到根治的目的。到後來（往往多年以後）。。忽然生出其他枝枝節節的病象來。必然想不到還是痢蟲作崇咧</p>
<p>那一天所映的幻燈。與電影。是各項痢疾的腸壁病理解剖。以及阿苗巴的活動狀態。另外又映了鈎蟲的潛入人體狀况。大約鈎蟲與人的皮肉接觸。在一分鐘内。已經達到皮下。以至血液。任你用酒精擦皮膚。而一部份已經潛入了　。試騐的方法。是以一只家兎來表演的。　　第六天演題。是講瘧疾。可惜不侫因時間衝突。未得聽完。根據以上简單的記錄。我以爲讀者諸公。應發生下列的感想。　　㈠現代的醫學。人家已經研究到這種地步。而且確有來歷。確有憑據。我們萬不可再是故步自封。說道「我國四千年來的醫學。足以保持我民族的健康」。　　㈡人家的發明和設備。都是提倡科學而來的。照我們醫事敎育的式微。科學根基的薄弱。怎樣急起直追方好。　　㈢尤其上述的所謂熱帶病。都是我們南部大半省分所習見習流行聞</p>
<p>最盛的。正不知要都少人。去研究和撲減才好。　　還有一點要請諸公注意的。。是歐洲人到上海來講學口内所提出引證的發明家與研究家。日本人很多。而從來聽不到中國人名字那是最最痛心了</p>
<h3 id="c131">臭蟲病 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>時症報告</p>
<p>臭蟲又名床虱，因爲牠的身體有一種奇臭，故名之曰「臭蟲」，又因爲牠藏身在床隙之際，所以又呌做「床虱」。　　臭蟲的身體是圆扁形，赤褐色，長二分許，周綠生着很多的毛，日間棲身在黑暗的地方，夜裏出來吸人的血，牠出現的時期是在初夏，牠與普通虱類不同的地方，就在這日伏夜出和一年四季中祇有夏季出現的一點上。　　一提到臭蟲，莫不談虎色變，人們大抵都經騐過牠的厲害的，對於牠和光臨，誰都表示一種「罙惡痛絕」的態度，但是出乎我們意料之外的，就是你愈不願親近牠，牠愈同你親近得利害，這眞使你感覺到無可奈何啊。</p>
<p>臭蟲，牠有着驚人的繁殖，牠的同類，散佈在全人類中間，專做那吸收民脂民膏的勾當，而且都在夜裏，人們睡眠的時候，使得人們失掉了睡的安靜，至於身體胖一點的人，那更是牠的好的粢糧，正中牠「擇肥而噬」的心理。　　　臭蟲的罪惡不僅僅乎在吸人類血液，擾人睡眠的一點上牠實在是一種毒蟲，牠有注射毒汁，傳播病菌的能力。　　臭蟲在吸人血的時候，牠有着兩重的工作，即㈠吸收外界的食物│人血，㈡排洩自已的毒汁，當牠把毒汁注射到人身的時候，被吸者在被吸處立刻起一種赤腫的小顆，形似風疹，尤其是四肢和面部，使你感到一種痛癢的苦處，婦女們同皮膚細嫩的人，被刺後最易呈此症狀。　　在最近這半月以來，以面部癢腫認爲風疹來就診的不下十數人之多。其實那裏是風疹。實在是中了臭蟲的毒啊。　　以上所說的不過是臭蟲給予我們身體的痛癢而已。還算不得牠的最大的罪惡，牠和最大的罪惡，就是傳播病菌。　　以鄙人八九年來的親察，以滬上一地的情形而論，每年在四五月的時候，嘗流行着一種病症，這病症大槪是一種不斷的熱，繼續到五七日之後纔退熱，（以惡寒始，以發汗退）退後五七│日至第十一日又惡寒發熱如前，再經過四五日而熱退，這種病症呌做（歸回熱。）</p>
<p>假使我們把患歸回熱者的血取出一騐，可以看出裏面游泳着許多螺旋體的病菌，這種菌是那裏來的呢，無疑地是臭蟲帶來的啊。照以前的觀察，以爲此菌爲虱所媒介，故爲「貧病」之一，其實虱子是四季皆有的，以時間論這個病的發生，恰恰與臭蟲的出現同時　，而且所患者并不限於貧者，有時上流社會也有盛染這病的，虱子僅僅乎在貧人的身上，而臭蟲是無間於貧富的，這更足以證明臭蟲是有帶菌之可能了。　　以上這兩種病症，因爲皆與臭蟲有關，吾無以名之名之，曰：。「</p>
<p>臭蟲病」</p>

<p>— 周萝白</p>
<p>醫德。宋國賓醫師累言之。各報端常可見其關於醫德之文字。現今上海醫師守道德者日加多。如添加貧民施診之時間。及不受藥房配藥之回佣等表現。未嘗非大聲疾呼之功。此實醫界之好現象也。藥界則如何。言之有愧。中藥雖有道地藥材之標語。究其内。非獨不道地者居多。且有西藥以製中藥丸散者。國藥云何哉。西藥則更五花八門。無奇不有。假貨冲眞品者有之。劣貨冲佳品者亦有之。國貨冒外貨者有之。外貨冒國貨者也有之。偷料者有之。代用者更有之。甚有美其名曰古方新製。用佛法以賣其野人頭者。祇認有利可圖。害人害衆所不計也。此風近更愈趨愈下。當時政府雖有管理藥品之規則。然經藥商一度之反對其反對者。並非管理之規則。乃規則中之不合科學原理及商情者。請求加以修改也。至今一擱三年。非獨　管理未見實行。即批示亦無有。以致一般似是而非之藥商。均不惜用其非人道之技倆以國利。故藥德之不修。至今可謂極矣。無怪上海一般外國藥商。藉口中國藥界之腐敗。有國際藥師公會之組織。其責任云在指導中國藥物之製造。改善中國藥業之發展。鳴呼痛者。豈國家未被國際共管。藥學先受其管乎。查吾國藥師雖不多。然開業於上海者不下數十人。連合已證明之藥劑生亦可在百餘人。何皆未之聞耶。盍不無分彼此。連合一致。加入中華藥學會。提倡藥德。對國家謀藥學之建設。對社會謀藥</p>
<p>學之發展。苟有不守道德者。無論其爲國家團體。無論其爲個人私業。羣起而攻之可也。因中華藥學會。係國家學術團體。倘能團結一致。其力較厚。而藥德亦易推行矣。關於藥德未有公守條例前。依余個人之意見。首須遵守精確純潔四字。茲分述之如次。　　何謂精│出品要精。並非唯我獨精。是儘我學力而成之。不可粗製濫造。如製麥精魚肝油。不可將麥精中之消化素破壞。又不可將魚肝油中之甲種生活素消失。更不可添加味精。冒稱維太命。現時中國出品之麥精魚肝油極多。然</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>其中保有消化素及生活素不失者能有幾種。又如錠劑之糖衣。中國出品。大都效糖菓之製法。容易潮解。其照藥用品製造。久貯不潮者亦能有幾家其他藥典製。劑能照中華藥典製造者。更能有幾家。此精字之當注意者。　　何謂確│分量要確。不可用兩磅之雅片酊冲成三磅。亦不可製一厘之金鷄納霜片冒稱二厘。因醫將此藥應用少最後無效。當然加增　分量。及用分量準確者。亦照分量不準確者用之。結果病體用過量而中毒。豈非害人乎。故秤藥當準確。製劑應準藥典。配方應照藥方。此確字之當注意者。　　何謂純│原料要純。非獨對提出軋局爾之魚肝油。添加菜油之古巴香。混和溴化鉀之碘化鉀。滲西檀香油之東檀香油等。可稱爲不純。凡不合中華藥典規定之含量者。皆可認作是不純藥。然</p>
<p>現時上海之醫房。有化騐室之設備者能有幾家。故余在新藥業公會。常有公會應設化騐室之提議。以使進貨時送化騐。可以知其純否。近外商亦有售假藥之發覺。亦可藉此之欺騙。此純字之當注意者。</p>
<p>何謂潔│處置要潔。並非鷄肉汁中混有鷄屎。糖漿中混有泥沙。始可稱不潔。凡製造時之手。盛藥品之容器。製藥品之機件。未經相當消毒者。均得認爲不潔。然中國製藥廠之潔者。能有幾家。而其中利用科學方法以製造者尤少。故國貨藥品。常有消毒不完全之責備。此潔字之當注意者。　　鳴呼。國難殷。民生日促。吾輩藥界同人。豈亡匹夫之責。曷不速起提倡藥德。以提高藥師之人格。以增加藥物之信仰。以完成藥廠之設備。以改進藥品之精良。如是者。未始非救國之一途。庶幾國人對於藥物上有相當之認識。且可使彼高麗人種。日本國籍。稱美國商。買德國藥。之四不象好人不能猖狂於吾中華國土。則藥界幸甚</p>

<p>（十七）</p>
<p>（戊）産褥的發熱</p>
<p>産褥期間發生較易且與生殖機能有關緊要的疾病。乃是産褥熱。此症由於生殖器的創傷傳染而來。産婦在産褥期内。好象是個負有重傷的人。所以易受創傷傳染。尤其是舊式穩婆。在接生的當兒。完全不知消毒。即使幸而是平産。却因手指器具的不潔。往往預使産婦在産褥期中。發生産褥熱的危險。較爲嚴重的産褥熱。即使幸而不死。却逃不了幾個月在床上的呻吟。簡括而言。産褥熱。乃是完全由於生殖器損傷部份上寄生的細菌所生毒性作用的創傷熱。此種細菌。對於人體含有峻烈的毒素。傳染血中。就起全身症狀。如果重要臟器。被其侵害。就不免死亡。　　舊式穩婆當中。也有曉得在會陰堅硬的當兒。將要阻礙兒頭排出的道理。於是就用汚穢不堪的長手指甲。狠心的刺破會陰。及陰唇。這是最易創傷傳染。最屬可怕的一回事。還有一種穏婆。慣用飽藏細菌的鐡鈎等物。妄施所謂大手術。往往將母兒兩命。同歸於盡。這也是創傷傳染的結果。還不及發産褥熱。就要喪生。所以分娩時。手指用具的消毒。最爲重要的任務。舊式穩婆。焉能明白這個原由。所以常常害人性命。　　産褥熱的預防方法。最重要的。必須淸潔生殖器。所有醫用器械。均須經過嚴密的消毒。極力避免病毒的傳染。産後子宮收縮。如果弛緩。應投麥角劑。可以促進子宮收縮。而免出血之危。子宮疼痛。可以貼用冰袋。發病的起初。亦應投以多量的麥角劑。總之。空中樓角的預防法。究竟不可提摸。若要根本解决。莫善於維持身體的抵抗力。就是利行排泄。促進營養而已。　　對於産褥期内患婦的看護法。亦關緊要。第一。須使患婦取適位。其次。須保身體的淸潔。並防衣褥的汚染。病房裏的空氣和光線。患婦的保溫等。均宜特别注意。不可略有疏忽。　　　）已（正軌的體溫</p>
<p>正軌産褥的過程中。平常並不發熱。分娩方畢之後。雖見體溫稍高。但在二十四小時内。即可復原。假使産褥中體溫昇到三十八度以上。應當視爲病理的發熱。但在産後一二日或三五日的體溫上昇。不可一槪而論。産褥第二星期的體溫。比較平時高二三分。在一日内的變化。亦不過五分。否則。即爲病理。尙須注意的。産褥中的體溫。甚爲敏銳。往往可由極微的障礙或精神感動。就有發熱的可能。　　分娩方畢之後。脈搏稍增。體溫下降。脈搏亦减。三五日後。滅至六十跳。甚至四十跳以下。此種减低。乃是合於正軌的現狀。　　産婦在産褥期内。第一星期的睡眠中。很易出汗。大抵是因爲多攝飲料。身體保暖。或授乳勞動。均不足爲異。　　分娩時或分娩以後。産婦往往惡寒。這也是生理的範圍。大抵由於分娩時身體的暴露。胎兒娩出時熱量損失的反應作用等原因。亦不可視爲病理的作用。</p>

<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>「尋」，世上不拘甚麽事，凡與「尋」字發生關係的，多少總有些兒難。</p>
<p>「尋人」，儘把「人」字寫得顚而倒之，兩脚朝天，儘着「備欵以待，决不食言」但是，提着脚爐蓋，從北市敲到南市，「人元是杳無音信。「尋生意」「尋錭錢」「尋飯吃」，更是難乎其難。你儘陪了笑臉，「先生」長，「老伯」短，「看在先嚴面上」，或是說得再可憐些兒，「救救我一」家老小」，甚至於陪了笑臉之後，再饒上二行眼涙，從然，「愛莫能助」，「留在心上」，完了。　「尋房子」也是如此。二條尊脚拐得酸溜溜的，似乎八百里馬拉松賽之後，好容易找到了配胃的房屋，但是「無眷不借」，「有小孩子不租」眞難。「尋花問柳」，是乎是易如反掌。街旁滿站着專等「尋的「」花」。只要你肯高抬貴手，何愁不一尋就着。但是，想起了在弄口「不准小便」示下小便時所見的「包治五淋白濁」廣告，不免的美色當前，望望然去之。「尋求内助」，雖然遷就得只要「身家淸白，面貌端正粗通文字不計貧富」，但是豆腐乾式的分類廣告登了三天，應徵者不是老太婆便是麻面，缺嘴，瞎眼，唖吧，不敢領敎。「尋開心」，也非易易。同朋友說說笑，說僵了，會由吵嘴而打架馬路上見了可喜娘你儘資格老到，「涉以游辭」，一個不得法，準會對不住你的尊頰老大嘴巴子送上來了　我尋來尋去，老是尋不到一回容易的事。一天，聽到一位朋友說，「黃浦是没有蓋的」</p>
<p>我於是大澈大悟道，「天下最容易的事，是尋死」。但是，不儘有投水尋死的，人給警察救起服毒的人，車送醫院救治。那麽，「尋死」，也是難。</p>

<p>— 鵬</p>
<p>披着一襲蒼翠的綠衣，五月的農村靜靜的安睡着！在那一片暖和的陽光下，坂間的桑樹，葉兒片片的都已長得手掌樣大，微風吹過那未熟的麥田，麥穗鼓動起一片靑色的波紋，一個農夫一手挽着一籃榖，一手從籃裏抓出榖子，一把把的撒下到那已耘平成了幾方塊的田裏去；另一個却還趨叱着一頭粗壯的牛，翻動着田裏的泥土原始在耕耘，他偶然抬起頭來瞧瞧那隣田裏：有的在播種，有的却已抽出了幾寸長的靑秧；一種焦急的形容流露在他臉上，叱牛的聲音便更粗重的在靜寂的空間振響着！</p>
<p>牧童横身在牛背上，從遠處茶山裏出來，他邊在回味着過去，「桑間濮上」的韻事，邊唱起：「採茶姑娘採花郎……」的山歌，聲音是那麽悠長而沈醉，像極力在把自已拉回到那些甜蜜的回憶裏去似的！　　「雞毛破布換糖吃！」嘴呌着，手搖着鐡片叮噹響；一個襤褸的賣糖者擔着兩個篾筐向村前過身，聽到了這聲音的村婦們忙忙的從房子裏跑出來，手夾了一卷卷的破布或雞毛，孩子們成羣的跟隨着，流着口涎等那換來的糖吃，一隻倦縮在屋角的脫毛的老狗突然也飛奔出來，對着那襤褸的陌生人，鼓起了兩個炯炯的眼珠狂吠着「旺！旺！旺！」　　一羣鴨子在一個池塘裏游泳着，鼓噪着！看鴨的拖着一根長竹竿顧自看野景樂。</p>
<p>兩個賣完了挑出去滿筐的白菜，在筐底裏換來一點布疋和雜物的農人流着汗從鎭上回來，纔走進村口，遠遠的就見自已家門口已立着一個蓬頭髮的婦人；那無疑的是他們的妻在等。　　一隻雄雞鼓起了兩翼。伸長着脖子啼：「喔！　喔！　喔！」白的炊烟從那些房子頂上一縷縷的飛飄起。　　布榖鳥在遠處密林裏呌「笨哥！　笨哥！」靑蛙在田裏生了氣，鼓出了兩顆圓眼：「壞！　壞！　壞！」……</p>
<p>五月的農村，靜靜的靜靜的安睡着。</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>黃昏瞑漠中，我同鐡華踏進了公館馬路一個小小的酒家，在街頭看見幾家商店都在大減價，大拍賣的聲嘶呐喊，但顧客却也寥寥可數，有的站在玻璃窗櫉外看一會就走了，在這裏也可以看見都市的經濟在日趨崩潰，繁榮的在内已經暴露了疲乏的徵象，使時代的蛻變，陷於不能避免的命運中。　兩個在都市中幾年來艱苦挣扎的靑年同伴，壓制不住埋藏在心頭的悲哀，時常用苦酒來麻醉自已，借酒澆愁明知無益的，但不能使我們不這樣借杯酒來對於人間無量罪惡，離合悲歡謀一刻的遺忘，旁觀者將認牢騷，當局者的心情實在難言，也不會給人了解。　　薄醉中離開了酒家，就在街燈熣燦中走入霞飛路，含有異國風光的霞飛路，紅是歡情綠是笑，也就是紅是凄愴綠是愁，這兩種不同的滋味，須踏在霞飛路上的人去細細體會的。　　在呂班路口，看見新夏威夷咖啡座，於是挾了從來没有去過的興味進去，推開兩扇小門，露出淡淡的燈光，就有兩個俄國侍者態度委很謙恭的招待，我們進去揀了個座位，喊了兩杯咖啡，一間小小的咖啡座，佈置還好，靠裏面是一個音樂台，時光還早，没有幾個顧客，音樂響了起來，紅暈的燈光，襯在綠色的頂幔上，别有一種情調，幾張壁　也成了異彩，凄婉的曲調，使我們埋沉在哀愁的心情中了。</p>
<p>音樂聲方纔停止的時光，來了一個俄國婦女，年華老大，但還塗脂抺粉，買弄年輕時代的風騷，這樣便成了醜惡靑春是値得寳貴與驕傲的啊，也許這個婦人年輕的時光，是個貴族的小姐漂亮的修飾，奢華的享樂，傲然的行動，給予綺年公子，裘馬王孫的拜倒，現在什麽都完了，以前的一切什麽都像一個殨落的夢，將殘敗的肉體，殘敗的靈魂，漂零異國，來供人蹂躪，博得代價維持自已的生活，啊怎樣的引起人的悲憫啊！　　最後坐了一刻，就在再度音樂聲中退了出來，那個婦人方在同一個好像約會的中年男子於棕擱掩映中談話，我們就在夜色中惘然的散了。</p>

<p>桂枝依然望了那些碗，不在意的樣子道：是推諉不是推諉，我那裏知道，可是誰也不勉强誰，用得着什麽推諉嗎？這半年以來，全是你對我這樣說，對我那樣說，所以我相信你。難道人家有女兒送不了人嗎？說着話時，臉色就沉了三分。積之道：你别生氣，聽我說。現在世路崎嶇，今天不知道明天的事，我這個差事，究竟能夠幹多少日子，現在還没有把握，所以我約你三年。桂枝突然將聲音放重來道：這不結了。你知道世路崎嶇，没有把握；爲什麽約我等三年？這幾句話駁得積之無話，可說他沉默了許久才，低着聲音道：你要知道我約三年的限期，那是有意思的。假如說，我這差事能幹三年，我每月極力的節省下來，可以多出五十塊，每年六百，三年可到二千，以後就有辦法，萬一幹不了三年，打個對折，也還可以積蓄一千塊錢，那個時候，有點資本在手上再去找出路，也比較膽大些，有了錢什麽事都好辦了。你呌我現在和你約一個短的時期，到了日子我辦不到，有了辦法那豈不更糟糕？所以我把日子約長些。假如週年半載有了辦法，當然週年半載之内，就合作起來，那就用不着三年了。桂枝紅了臉道：你誤會了我的意思了。我不是說時間遲早那兩層的事，我是怕日子久了，有什麽變化，第一就是我媽，他不能是那樣好說話，可以讓我隨便的說，到了那個時候，他要我怎麽着，我能夠不怎麽着嗎？積之聽了。就向他微笑的望着，看了有一會子，這才道：什麽呌怎麽着？桂枝微笑道好好的說着正經話，你又開起玩笑來了。積之道：不是我喜歡開玩笑，因爲你的話，是個開玩笑的資料，所以順便我就說上兩句。（七○）</p>

<p>— 偑英</p>
<p>在你的兒童生病的時候有了家庭，不能没有兒童，有了兒童，就難免不生疾病。欲使兒童避免疾病，第一要使兒童有强健的身體，强大的抵抗力，才能保持永久的健康。不過兒童發育未足，到底難得到强大的抵抗力，因此　弱，失眠，傷風，生齒發熱，夢中驚醒等等，都是兒童常遇的困厄。　　但是我們很淸楚的知道，在兒童的健康上多多的注意，便可使避免疾病的機會加多，做母親的人，如其能够像醫生一般，規定時間的去檢騐伊們的兒童，那麽，一定可以得到良好的結果，最顯著的效果，就是從同伴那裏傳染而來的疾病，普通不會十分謹愼，十分留心的，現在因檢騐而發見，可以避免了。　　從前我們相信兒童見什麽就要拿什麽，而且認爲生病是不可避免的。現在我們却已知道預防傳染，不但要使他們造成一種天然的抵抗能力，而且要預先避免一種疾病的襲擊。卽如預防喉痧，猩紅熱，天花等，都有良好的血淸或種痘等方法來防禦。但是我們不要以爲傳染病是可怕的，其他的疾病不妨忽視，這却不然。不論何種疾病。都是可怕的。都有危險性。至於要造成强健的身體和强大的抵抗力，靠了左列的幾種方法：</p>
<p>㈠食的時間要正確規定，食物的分量要適當平均；如脂肪質，蛋白質，澱粉質（炭水化物），流質，和各種維他命等；就是礦酸鹽和有綠色素物如蔬菜等，也要搭配些，因爲這種食物是身體長成的需要品。㈡養成排泄，發逹筋肉，保養氣力和强健體格的有定時的習慣。㈢每日在新鮮的空氣和日光中住數小時。兒童所穿的衣服，以保持手足和暖爲度。㈣在空氣良好而流通的居室中，有充分的睡眠。㈤要行定時的健康檢查，這種檢查包含騐血，詳細的考察，確定没有血虧。騐小便和大便，探尋容易自生中毒的腹之呼吸。　　不論兒童生何種疾病，最早的病兆，都是差不多的。這種徵候不外是呼吸器官出毛病，例如打噴嚏，鼻中有分泌物，如鼻涕等，呼吸困</p>
<p>難，喉頭腫痛；或者有更利害的徵候，例如胸部的喘氣和咳嗽等。發熱或者也起於這種徵候的。但是有一件事可以放心的，就是從喉頭通到耳朶的管，假使也連累及了，起了一種不規則的發高熱，因此不安靜，擾亂睡覺，那麽對於兒童的耳朶，却用不着直接去注意，因爲年幼，不致生痛。　　胃腸的徵候，或者也會在任何疾病的開始時發現的，而且很是混亂，因爲這種病很易忽視，而一時又認不淸到底是一種什麽病，現象很多，不易確定，有的是胃納不佳吃不下東西，有的是嘔吐，有的是下痢，有的是利害的便秘。任何一種現象，都足以釀成胃腸病。　　有許多做母親的人，不明白兒童有病應該安睡的道理，以爲病的兒童精神已是很苦，應該敎他開開心，不妨弄弄玩具，爬爬地板，甚至他要做什麽，就讓他去做，殊不知兒童受疾病的攻擊時要使他安睡的緣故，大槪有三項可說。第一，保存他的活動力，和復元的能力，使增加自然而然的恢復精力的機會。第二，阻止因調和室中不同空氣之故而使身體的受寒，以及免除病的兒童的熱病過動之疲勞。第三，避免疲勞，因爲疲勞本身是有害於健康的。　　安睡於床上，應該放棄一切快樂回憶和思念。做母親的人在這個時候，最好多預備些陪伴的東西，卽如美麗的被褥，鮮艷的睡衣，玲瓏的小桌，玻璃的瓶子等等，引誘兒童的歡喜，肯安靜地在床上過生活，架子放盆鮮花，並備些好看而可口的食品，一方面使兒童見了歡喜，一方面使他肯吃。　　以上的話，不過是一種參考，並非說兒童生了病，不必請醫生，不過在未請醫生之前，有種帮助，並使兒童保存元氣而能恢復得快些。</p>

<p>佛徒參禪，似乎有自力啓悟和他力助成的兩種，而現在中國流行的，却全是一種他力宗的思想。某院長的求神拜佛，希望菩萨來中國，是大家周知的事實，可以不必提起，就是某委員的靜待日本自斃的五年計劃，也是他力宗的禪心的顯露，最近則某部長又自外國傳來好音，說敵若襲平津，美國必出來干涉，我們且誘敵深入罷！凡此種種，都是中國人的他力主義的樂天思想，說得好聽一點，是「以夷制夷」的外交政策說得澈底一點是勤吃懶做，樂禍幸災，借刀殺人，無爲而治的取巧心理。</p>
<p>但是天理雖有必然，而人事却不能一定。俄國小說裏，有一位棺材業者，看準了他隣人的一位重病富翁的必死，便私下忖度了他的尺寸，製就了一口棺材，待售重價。可是那位富翁却因病重而去試轉地療養的結果，竟死在外國溫泉地方了我們恨俄國的出賣中東路，恨俄國的不來代我們打日本人的憤怒，豈不同這位棺材匠的憤怒是一個樣子？　　從前，衰衰諸公還有一個國際聯盟的後盾在那裏，所以敵人批我左頰，我更向以右頰，說是遵守聯盟規約的君子之國，禮儀應該如此現在再失熱河，三讓多倫，大約是到了褪下褲子來請敵人打屁股的地步了若再誘敵深入，决定放棄平津而待美國的來援，正和吃了砒霜藥老虎的計策一樣，君子雖然是君子到了極點，但是死君子在活小人的面前，究竟有點什麽意義呢？</p>

<p>王洪緒外科證治全生：『發背，乃癰疽中大患，紅腫痛甚者，應稱背癰。』我幼年時，背上忽生小疽，心中大慌。父親對我笑道：『那有這話，年紀輕輕的』我究不懂「發背」和「年紀」有什麽關係。後來讀項羽本紀，至「項王疑范增與漢有私，稍奪之權。范增大怒，曰：「天下事大定矣，君王自爲之願賜骸骨，歸卒伍。」項王許之，行未至彭城，疽發背而死。』這才恍然大悟。</p>
<p>范增從榮陽東歸，不知他在路上想些什麽？也許想起項梁在世時，那麽言聽計從；楚懷王孫心得立爲帝，還是他所獻的奇計。也許想起項羽信任他的時候，尊他爲亞父；鉅鹿之役，各國諸侯奉項羽爲總司令，好不威風。也許想起令章邯等降將守關中的策略，可恨章邯那些飯囊，一夜失關中。也許想起項羽和他别扭：他呌項王莫放鬆了劉邦那個大敵；而項王倒反御駕親征反動派，打得精疲力竭，大敵長趨入關，幾乎危及根本。想來想去，事事不如人意。起初「不但主擇臣，臣亦擇主」，如魚得水，希望無窮。現在拆穿西洋鏡，長衫朋友竟不免時時受劍把子的氣。一個德隆望重的老臣，日暮途窮，皇皇如喪家之犬。越想越氣，越氣越想，半途上就疽發背而死了。　　王洪緒治發背，主「陽和通腠，解其」</p>

<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>㈠</p>
<p>聰明的企業家們，定下了一九三二年是國貨年，於是在報紙上，在「名流」「領袖」的口中，以及在一切大幅的廣告中，我們便時常可以看聽到「提倡國貨」「挽回利權」的誠懇勸告，「勸告」的目的，據說是「救國家，救民族」。</p>
<p>海關上也發出警告式的統計：去年入超數五萬五千餘萬兩。銀行的營業報告中都將這數字轉載，并發出求援的喊聲。這年頭，窮苦大衆們在唉聲嘆氣，企業家們也緊縐着眉頭。一切都傳染了「不景氣」的瘟疫！</p>
<p>於是國産品一致减價，特别是國産綢緞，南京路上飄掦着國産綢緞减價的招帘，「×家擱淺×廠聯合大拍賣，×家×××聯合大竸賣」，外國的喇叭和中國的鑼鼓在門樓上拚命地嘶着聲音呌，報紙上登着大幅的廣告，呼籲，勸告，鼓勵，引誘每一個企業家都用盡方法想呌起市塲的購賣力，想誘起人民的消費力。據說這是爲了「國家」！</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>購賣力還是呌不起來，因爲窮困已普遍了社會，於是聰明人又想出新花樣，這便是最近的時裝展覽大會。　　現在讓我說一說時裝展覽大會的盛况罷：</p>
<p>會塲與舞塲没有兩樣：音樂師繼續地奏着樂，各種顔色的電炬閃出各種顔色的光窗户的玻璃都染成翠色，坐位擺在四週，太太，小姐，少奶奶，校花，閨秀，名媛之流像屏風一般的環坐着，坐不下的站着，一層，兩層，人擠人，人挨人，焦急地等待，焦急地盼望，粉香和汗臭在空氣中交流，空氣被做成嘈雜的一團，冠生園的白衣侍者便在人叢中往來地活躍。　　人叢中突然現出一個光亮的頭，報告，感謝，道歉，說有個玲丁丁來表演，。玲丁丁可不是狗明星</p>
<p>玲丁丁出現了，一個高大的漢子，演說似的呌：「要用國貨，國貨邪氣好，不用國貨是亡國奴……」妖聲怪氣，手舞足蹈，太太小姐們都笑了，玲丁丁也笑了。</p>
<p>接着，可憐的秋香，江北調，尖着聲音，豆大的汗珠在臉上流，還有，學女人跳舞，偌大一個漢子，扭扭揑揑，於是太太小姐們又笑了，於是玲丁丁也又笑了。</p>
<p>大家還是焦急地等待着，電炬在閃爍着眼睛，白衣侍者更來回得起勁，太太小姐們有點不耐煩。　　終於，表演時裝的明星們來了，從人叢裏擠到會塲中央了，一個，兩個，五個，八個，明星，皇后，國貨的時裝，繞埸一週，於是大家瘋狂地呌，向中間擠坐着的站起來，站着的再站上椅子，頸子伸長，眼睛睜大，人擠着人，人壓着人，千百雙眼睛都釘住那會塲中央的八個，八件時裝，八幅廣告，攝影師也忙着配光，忙着安鏡頭，那八個便一字兒擺開，埸中是一團嘈雑，只有幾個木做的衣架直立在會塲的角落裏，怪冷落。耳邊有人在輕輕地呌：「乖乖，活動廣告，活動衣架」！　　「廣告」走進去了，完了，大家爽然而又釋然，抽一口長氣，轉身又擠，擠出門外去。</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>活動廣告不僅是一種引誘，一種鼓勵，簡直是一種壓力，它迫着人去買，買，買。資本主義的浪費Ｌｈｅｔｒａｇｅｄｙｏｌｗａｓｔｅ裏摘在生活中東希洛特的記載。他說，有的廣告勸他多吃麵包，有的勸他多吃葡萄乾，有的勸他多坐火車，有的又勸他多住在家裏……只還没有人勸他多用棺材！</p>
<p>誰能接受一切的勸告呢？這是多麽滑稽的把戲呵！</p>
<p>浪費，一切都毫不吝惜地浪費這世界確是過飽了；可是大部分的人却在啼飢號寒，就是活動廣告也呌不回他們最低限度的購買力，資本家和窮苦大衆都縐緊眉頭，這世界又是何等的凋敝呵！</p>

<p>翠羽明　　細　。</p>
<p>絶代仕人　　國，</p>
<p>老夫惟唱念奴嬌。</p>
<p>一夕，予偕友人自舞塲一暼歸來，因而憶及熊希齡先生之念奴嬌詞，截取一句，口占七絕。况恭逢電影皇后，以跳舞救國倡，亦不可舞詩以張之也。去年報載熊希齡先生游西湖，塡念奴嬌詞云：</p>
<p>雙峯殘照，看樓台爭聳，萬門千户。太息東南民力盡，依舊湖山歌舞。遠聽江潮，胥濤怒吼，總爲私仇訴。獨餘孤柏巍巍，精忠千古。曾記句踐君臣，臥薪嘗膽，忍力全疆土。絕代佳人能助國，愧殺男兒無數。敵勢方張，廷爭未息，又見金兵渡。國魂安在？域中今竟誰主？</p>
<p>熊先生畢竟老人，態度嚴肅。雖塡管絃冶蕩之舊曲，亦寓傷時憂國之孤懐。若是靑年，從事「詞的解放運動」，詞中所說，當不外「打打麻將」，「國家事管」</p>

<p>— Jules　Kenaro作林取譯</p>
<p>亞伽特</p>
<p>來補奥洛林的缺的是奥洛林的一個係女兒亞伽特。紅蘿蔔鬚很好奇的觀察着這新來的女僕，若干日内，雷辟克一家人都把注意力由紅蘿萄鬚身上轉移到這新來的女僕身上，　　「亞伽特，」雷辟克家的說，「你走進房間裏以前要在門上敲一敲但這並不是說要你像馬一樣用蹄子把門蹴個對穿。」「她上任了，」紅蘿蔔鬚想，「但我看她開飯時怎樣。」大家聚在那寛闊的廚房裏吃飯。亞伽特臂上挽着一條飯巾，預備由　那邊跑到碗櫃那邊，由碗櫃那邊跑到飯桌那邊，因爲她全不曉得好好地走路，她寗願氣喘呼呼地，兩頰飛紅地跑着。　　她說話說得太快，笑得太高，太想賣力了。雷辟克首先坐下來，把飯巾解開，把碟子推到擺在他前面的一盤旁邊，取了一些肉和汁，又把碟子拖回來。他自已斟上飲料，彎着背，垂着眼睛，像平常一樣無精打采地，小心地吃着。　當換菜時，他便低頭望着椅子，移動他的臀部。　雷辟克家的親自給她的孩子們分菜，首先分給大哥菲利克斯，因爲他喊着餓，其次分給姐兒愛勒絲丁，因爲年紀較大，最從分給坐在桌子盡頭的紅蘿蔔鬚。　他從來不要求添菜，好像這事照例是被禁止着似的。他有了一份便應該够了，如果别人再分給他，他便受着，他不喝水，他把自已不喜歡吃的飯脹满一嘴，這是爲着討好雷辟克家的緣故，因爲一家人裏面祇有她一個人最喜歡吃飯。　大哥斐利克斯和姐兒愛勒絲丁比較自由，他們吃完了一份還要第二份，他們照着雷辟克的方法，把碟子推到盛菜的盤子旁邊。可是没有一個人說話。「他們究竟有什麽事情？」亞伽特想。但他們什麽事情也没有。他們是這樣不說話，如是而已。她對着這一家人眞忍不住要伸開手臂打呵欠呢。雷辟克慢慢地吃着。好像嚙着碎玻璃似的。雷辟克家的平常雖然像喜鵲一般好說話，但在飯桌上，却祇會拿手和頭做樣子指揮一切。姐兒愛勒絲丁抬起眼睛望着天花板。大哥菲利克絲玩着麵包屑，没有水杯的紅蘿蔔鬚則祇留心在什麽時候當用麵包把他的碟子揩乾浄，揩得太快了，怕别人說他貪吃，揩得太遲了，又怕别人說他迂緩。因此，他便從事於複雑的算計。　　突然，雷辟克拿着飯桌上的水瓶去盛來了一滿瓶淸水。　「這事我也會做呢，」亞伽特說。　不，她並没有說，她不過這樣想着罷了。她也受了他們的傳染，舌頭變得不靈了，她不敢說話，可是她以爲讓主人自已去倒水，這是她的過錯，她便加倍當心了。（未完）</p>

<p>自有九十餘年進口洋貨，幾千萬萬出口賠欵，並二十餘年内亂不息，農村破産，尙是一半兒遮掩之詞；實際已到民窮財盡，整個社會經濟破産之候。至如何復興農村，旣非高談闊論所能奏效，亦非侈陳學理摭拾成規所能濟事。要如中山先生所說，「照着自己社會情形，迎着世界潮流做去。」如今所亟庶解决者，卽都市呆存的金錢如何會流到農民手中去，農民的産物，如何會到都市中來，又如何使農民得到休養生息的機會，家給户足的願望，而逹到藏富於民的目的。則　要以言之，可緩不怠之建設與民休息。停迫索之佂赋傳遂生養。合作制度誠可仿行，但應念及農民之智識程度並公私經濟之成見，能否轉移，橘逾淮而枳，何况一切制度之移植乎？故目前切實易行者，莫如就原有之制度加以改革修正而推行之，若舉辦農事借本，及融通低利資金與典當，並扶助農民集會（銀錢之會）以事生産。均可以補農民銀行之不逮。至高利貸固爲農村破産之遠因，要知所以有高利貸，原爲社會之病態，假使農民經濟寛裕，金融組織完善，何致有高利貸之發生。而目前所以使農民更覺艱困者，正惟欲求高利貸而不可得，蓋農村之高利貸者，大都與貧農相差一間耳。其較爲股實者，見時局如此，有欵亦不敢貸放，反將現金移存於都市，以防萬一之危險。於是鄉村之籌碼愈少，周轉愈不靈，而酿成今日之現象。故治標之計，仍在向地方殷户，喩以義利，並予以相當之保障，勸其出資借貸，酌减利息，或收買所以不能藏儲之農産，以廣農民之生路。本期得有許叔璣，黃枯桐，湯惠蓀，黃通，諸先生之鴻著，皆爲學識經騐兼有之作，非徒托空言者可比。此外復承讀者賜　，限於篇幅，不及備戰，附此誌歉。　　　　　柳堂</p>

<p>許璇</p>
<p>確立農業政策之兩大前提</p>
<p>我國近年以來，「農村破産」之呼聲，喧騰於世。而所謂農業救濟之方案，遂如雨後春筍，騰諸口頭，散諸報章。政府亦漸注意及此，如民食會議，農業金融會議，以及　絲救濟會議等，時有所聞。近行政院且設農復興委員會，召集各地同人，互相討議，雖其内容未詳，而據報章所載，已可覘其大略。將來能　實行，或實行至何程度，現未敢豫言。所最期望者，無論何種計劃，或何種設施，均須以農民爲本位。否則，一種政策之名稱，雖足號召一時，而其實則非是，或適得其反，雖出言農村復興，吾恐長衣漫漫，不知何時得見東方之白也。</p>
<p>現在我國農業狀况，漸趨於衰頽，確立種種之農業政策以改良之，斯固然矣。然農業非能自爲改良也，經營農業者爲農民，不先維持農民之生活而安定之，而欲望其以終日辛勞不得一飽之身，改良農業，其能之乎。我國農村向爲國富之策源地，亦卽爲社會之基礎，而近年以來，衰落之象，與自俱增，日非速謀振興不可；然農村非能自振興也，組織農村者爲農民，不先改善農民之經濟狀態，令其安居樂業，不至見異思遷，離鄉以去，而欲望農村之繁榮，是亦綠木求魚也。故欲確定或施行農業政策，或農村振興計劃，均須隨時隨地，以農民爲主眼。</p>
<p>元來農業問題或農村問題，與政治·經濟·敎育·及一切社會問題，俱有密切關係，因之農民亦常受政治·經濟·敎育·及社會制度之支配。故欲論農村復興與農民之關係，其所涉範圍，甚廣且大，茲限於篇幅，不能一一述之，第就農村本身上略舉數例，以示農民本位的政策之必要。</p>
<p>現在農村之大病，「窮」字足以盡之。故欲醫農村之病，必先救農村之窮。然農村非自窮也，合居於農村之農民之窮，乃以成其窮。救窮之道，農業金融政策尙已／然此政策，若不以農民爲本位，則其效果亦至徴。在現中國農業金融機關，寥若農星。江浙兩省。較勝一籌，而農業資金之流通數尙有限，今後宜大擴充農業金融機關俾都市金融與農村金融，互相調節，以袪都市膨脹農村衰微之弊。然若徒襲農業金融之美名。而於農民本身的利益若何。不加考慮，則農民之窮如故，農村之窮亦如故！如農民銀行放欵於農民，俾其免高利貸之剝削，其意固甚善也。然農民受惠之多少，仍視其放欵條件而殊。以金額言，農民欲多多益善，銀行則惟恐欵雖收回，靳而不與，二者各有理由，不能備責，惟農民旣欲借欵以經營農業，倘其人誠實可信，銀行似應儘量供給之，否則；設農民借千元銀行僅貸以五百元，或不及此數，則農民之經營計劃以破，雖較勝於「一文莫名，」而其受益甚少矣。以擔保言，小農槪無土地，又乏信用，借欵誠難若登天，即銀行許以信用借欵，而往往令其覓殷實商舖擔保方肯放欵試思農民若能得殷實商舖爲之保證，則其信用已足向他虑借欵何必乞憐於銀行部　　　　　　　　。輒窮數日之力遍覓舖保。而終不可得，廢然而返，甚或遠道而　　　　　　　　　更增捐失，殊可憫也以期限言。農業放欵，宜與農業之性質相　　　　　　　　　以購　種及桑葉，倘其期限過促，則收贖後即須賤價出售，以償僓　　　　　本稍　收農民究有何益？由是論之，農業金融，周爲振興農村之善策，而放欵若不爲農民着想；則農民終無以沾其實惠，俾改善其經濟狀態，而其效至徵矣。「生産落後，」亦爲現今農村問題中之最嚴重者，似獎勵生産之增加不容或緩矣。然生産政策，若不與價格調節政策相輔而行，則生産不足時，生産者與消費者兩受其害；有餘時，消費者未必有利，生産者或反以坐困；例如米之需要，乏於彈性，米價雖大跌，而消費者不能因此每日多食幾升米，以至於飽死，生産者倘迫於經濟於秋收後事相出售，則一時米價必奇跌，不足償其生産費，而益以受窘，去年米榖之「豐收成災」卽其明證也。去年各省稻田，雖未爲大熟，而在近數年間，總算爲比較的豐收，宜乎生産增加，農民咸額手相　也。而事實顧反乎是，米價大跌，其原因甚複雑，而其影響亦於各方面，而彌形其嚴重，各方人士，大聲疾呼，均以提高米價爲詞，財政部亦曾召集民食會議，謀救濟之。微論其所擬方策，尙未實行，即令實行，挽回米價，而於農民，恐無甚利益；蓋農民多已於秋收之後，將米出售，卽有餘糧，其數甚微也。所以米價之調節政策，應預爲農民着想，於米價未跌之先，設法以維持其價格，如此，農民方克享米榖增收之利益。否則，若俟米價大跌，農民已無餘糧時，而始皇皇然謀提高米價之方，則米價大跌時，農民旣受米賤之苦，一俟　年春夏間，米價漸高；農民又須購米以充飢，轉受米貴之苦，故米價之調節政策，雖爲一種良法，　而若不以農民爲本位，用得其時，則農民仍難享米榖增收之利益。不僅米然也，其他農産物生産與價格之關係，亦復如是。所以生産政策與價格調節政策；應兼籌並顧，因時制宜，俾</p>
<p>農産物之價格丨臻於安定，農民得享生産增加之實惠。如是，則農民之經濟上地位日高，而</p>
<p>農村亦隨而隆昌矣。</p>
<p>以上所述；雖止一二端，而卽此足見農業政策及農村振興計劃，須以農民爲本位，方有效果之可言。否則，農民受種種壓迫，將無以自存，而欲望農民所經營之農業，漸臻發逹，農民所組成之農村，日有起色，是貴兀者以舉千鈞，跛者以追走免，吾知其不可能也。我國今日農民疲敝已極幾爲無告之民矣若能怠起直追，扶掖之，策動之，俾其專心畎畝，怡然自得，不至强者流爲盗匪，弱者轉乎溝　，則亡羊補牢　時尙未晚；若再因循時日，有政策而不克行，或行之而未得其道，吾恐不出數年，農民益瀕於絕　，農業亦將萬刦不復矣！工國前途，尙忍言乎？　　　二十年五月十日</p>

<p>在烽火頻驚，國難嚴重的當中，行政院乃有復興農村委員會的創　。由院招致各方面的聞人，會議兩天，議决了不少重要的事項，而且定此後當於各省設立分會，任調查建設及推行事宜。那麽，今後關於農村復興的工作，諒必緊張起來，便不興的農村，復歸於興，這是一宗可爲慰頌的事體。　　會議所議决的事項，其詳細的内容，現猶未悉。但據報章所載，以我看來，却不覺得有何多大新奇的方策。本來「太陽之下没有新東西」，說來說去，總不外乎舊調重彈罷了。例如關於技術，經濟及農村自治等項，大都是從前中央的許多會議議過了的（雖其名稱節目或許不同）。但是舊調重彈，並非錯誤，而適足以表示問題的益見深刻。故不壓舊調的重彈，只愁舊調的忘却呢。」</p>
<p>年來關於農村崩潰，農民痛苦，農業恐慌等的呼聲和這等事實的記載，確實不少，用不着在這裏重複的　述，不過我們要注意到農村之所以崩潰，農民之所以痛苦，農業之所以恐慌，都不是農村，農民·農業三者局部的個别的事體，而是由於整個的政治，經濟，以及封建勢力，等的作用所孕育而滋生出來的，這是所謂内在的原因，還要注意到帝國主義使中國殖民地化的作用，這是所謂外來的原因；這兩種原因實在交錯以凋喪元氣，農村就老早不興了，起碼自鴉片戰爭以來，慢性的表現着，然自民國以來，慢性的更弄成急性的而愈加深刻地的表現着。換句話說，農村不獨崩潰而是破産了，農民不獨痛苦而是流亡了，農業不獨恐慌而是敗滅了。那麽，這内在的和外來的兩種原因，設若無法解消，則所謂農村復興，恐終於望梅止渴或揚湯止沸而已。故我們第一個觀念，却在除害，而興利遠在其次。譬如病久了的人，五腑六臟都壞了，如果醫生不先用藥或施手術去淸理其腑臟，遽然投以參茸之類的補品，不獨無益，反而會弄死人啊！除害然後興利的道理，亦不外乎此。對於外來的原因，唯有實行反帝的工作才能把它解消，這層姑且不談。至於内在的原因，便是所謂内政的問題，亦屬復興農村的先决問題，換句話說，就是除害的工作，就是要先實行消極的農業政策，據我個人的意見，有幾種事體非先行解决不可，簡括的舉示，便是㈠農村的治安。㈡田賦的高壓。㈢重利的盤剝。㈣佃租的剝削。㈤公債的强派。㈥兵差的徵發。㈦苛捐雜稅。㈧鴉片及賭博。㈨天災。這九件事體。我認爲是有先行解决的必要。但要解决這些。又應先打破軍閥官僚土劣等的封建勢力。否則前門驅虎後門進狼。農村還是不興。至於剿共一事，政府正在努力中，不消說了。</p>
<h3 id="c178">關於農村復興之管見 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>湯·惠·蓀·</p>
<p>當今我國禍患頻仍，民不聊生之際，而當局兢兢以復興農村爲倡此誠目下救國之根本要圖也。吾國號稱農業國，農業人口占十之八。國家之財源，泰半取之於農村。對外貿易，十九爲農産。則吾國今日政治經濟之命脈，，侍農業以爲維緊者亦彰彰明矣。夫農村之衰落，農業之恐慌，風靡於全世界，固不獨吾國然也。惟究其底蕴，則吾國之所謂農業恐慌者，决非可與歐美之農業恐慌，同日而語也。歐美之所謂農業恐慌，則大率由於農業技術的發逹，與生産過剩，所謂農業内在的原因者居多。而吾國之所謂農業恐慌，則大率由於兵災匪患，　苛稅重役等，所謂農業外在的原因，與半封建式的生産關係之内在的原因而起。明乎此，則吾國之農村衰落，與農業恐慌，决不可與歐美之農業恐慌，認爲純經濟問題者相比擬也。　復興農村委員會，。集國内聞人，籌議復興農村之道。技術也，經濟也，組織也，各種决議，均爲復興農村之必要條件。而其大半則爲中央歷來各種會議所曾有之提案，而未見諸實施者。此等决議，中央如有復興農村之誠意與决心，而能次第實行，則農村之復興，可指日而待矣。</p>
<p>抑猶有進者，吾國農村之衰頽，與農業之恐慌，卽由於内在的與外來的兩方面之原因而起。倘徒從農業内部之改進，與農民自身之努力，爲復興農村之張本。而政治之狀况如故，兵匪之災禍不减，生産關係之不良，亦仍如舊。則縱令農業改進，農民自拔，而農村之衰頽，農業之恐慌，猶無改進之日也。余爲此論，非謂復興農村委員會所决議法不佳也。復興農村委員會所决議之辦法，爲改進農村之本身問題者，固盡善盡美矣。然其能實施而期得實效者，惟有視今後政治之改進，地方之安寗，以及一切社會政策之實施等，以爲轉移而已。否則，所謂復興農村者，亦惟等於紙上談兵，與中央歷來所召集之各種會議，議而不能實行者，無以異也。</p>
<p>今之論農村問題者，不外農業業務與農民生活之兩方面。則農村衰頽者，亦惟此農業業務之不振，與農民生活之困疲等兩大原因所構成。農業業務之不振，其焦點在於后産關係之不良。農民生活之困疲，由於農民智識之卑陋。則復興農村，首當注意此二點。　　夫吾國農民，大率爲過小農，農民一户之耕地面積，尙不數其一家勞力之分配，其所收入，即令全部歸爲已有，亦不敷生活之所需，而况其一大部分，必須支付佃租，應數苛稅，如是而欲使農民不窮，農村不衰，是猶綠木而求魚，鳴乎可得故余謂不欲復興農村則已，苟欲復興農村，首須改變農業生産關係，施行土地政策，實現中山先生之平均地權，與耕者有其田之主張，生産關係，旣經改變，一户之耕地面積，從而瀇張則農業之勞力，得爲合理的分配，農業之技術，得有採用之可能，由是而産增加，收入裕如，農業業務問題，可得而解决矣。</p>
<p>吾國之敎育，大率偏設城市，所謂鄉村敎育者，卽在江浙敎育發逹之區，其離普遍也尙遠甚，無怪鄉民愚蠢，任人宰割，而農村中一切事業，操之於少數土劣地痞等之手，農民生活之困疲，實農民智識之愚陋，不能爲自助互助之組織，有以致之也，然則，欲改善農民生活，促進農村自治，首宜普及鄉村敎育，以增進農民之智識，實爲切要之圖，近年吾國正盛倡農業合作，復興農村委員會，亦注意此點。合作制度，足以調劑農村之金融，增加農民之生産，法善意美，亟宜推而廣之，使遍設於吾國鄉村，亦爲復興農村之要項也。惟合作制度</p>
<p>，取自助互助之精神，所謂「人人爲我我爲人人」之要决。然則，合作事業之推行易，而合作事業之成功則難。丹麥號稱爲世界之模範農業國，考其農業之發逹，由於合作制度之成功。而合作制度之成功，全恃鄉村敎育之基礎，爲其先驅也。　　最後余猶欲進一言者，卽關於農村金融之救濟問題也。復興農村委員會，對於農村金融救濟之道，定有切實辦法。並有商請上海銀行公會發起設立農村金融調劑委員會，以爲輔助調劑農○金融之舉。如能見諸實施鄉民之受惠，當匪淺鮮也。竊爲農業金融之調劑，貴在能以集中於都市之金融，流轉於鄉村。使一國之金融，能如血腥之循環週轉，而不致停滯　枯。則農村金融機關之設立，須本此意旨。惟現時吾國各省之農民銀行農工銀行，其機關仍設立於大都市　旣不能　於農民直接之借貸，又不能與其資金轉榐融通於地方，以圖金融之分散，殊失農村金融地　分散之本旨。余謂目前我國之農業金融機關，須力求其分化，散布於僻壤之鄉村，則其資金雖少，鄉民亦可得融通資金之實惠。否則，雖言調劑農村金融，而適足以助長金融之都市集中地。此亦復興農村所當注意之點也。　　　面所言，平淡無奇，不免老生常談。然誠能一一見諸實施，别吾農民受惠，當亦不　矣。</p>
<p>中國的農村，雖然是長期的受着帝國主義的侵略，然其骨子裏頭還是爲封建勢力所支配。農村的生産關係，還封建的，而爲土地所支配的，所以土地問題，是個嚴重的問題，非謀其解决不可。中國的農民大多數没得土地，有的亦屬面積很少（每户平均總不滿三十畝，）</p>
<p>如此則話多新農法新技術，無由推行，生産工具已不能改變，生産力自不能增進，農村經濟亦遂不能充裕起來。故以爲在積極的政策說來，首當改變現在的農村的生産關係。然以目前情勢而論，改變農村的生産關係一事，談何容易，苟能做到所謂「耕者有其田」，已經是了不得啊。總之，現在所最希望的，還是在實行消極的農業政策，就是要做到除害的工作，用老調子來說，是希望能夠撫字休養，與民蘇息，用新名詞來說，則爲實行農民解放，不然，每舉一事，農民卽多增一分痛苦，俗話說的三多立一個神主牌，便多出許多鬼來。這並非是政策本身的不好，而是本末先後的關係。並且證諸事實，奉行政策的人，往往假公濟私，借新政之名行敲剝之實，農民不特無力接受，反而望而生畏，倘使新　的事，不根據客觀的狀况，而爲閉門所造的車，那更糟糕，徒使多數農民供其犠牲罷了。又或操之過切，不顧農民的利害，則反而閙出亂子來。所以生心害政，固然不可，削足適嚴，亦行不通。農民現在所最需要的是什麽？據我看來，第一是需要安靜，及解除種種的壓迫和剝削，故如果能爲農民除害，則無異於啟發其興利的機能。　　上海一地，積集了大量的現欵，這是表示着農村破産，内地金融枯竭的事實。所以這次復興農村委員會决議［商請上海銀行公會、發起設立農村金融調劑委員會，由各銀行聯合或自由盡力輔助調劑農村金融」。由上海方面的銀行放欵救農的聲浪，自去年來卽覺洋洋盈耳</p>
<p>。但事實上放出了多少欵子，救濟了多少農民？經過這次的會議後，各銀行家諒必能爲更進一步的努力，大多數苟延殘喘的農民，·正在企候着財神的降臨呢</p>
<p>凡是一種政策的建立，首當以客觀的事實爲準據，而推行政策，則須政府，公私團體，個人等各方面，作一貫的努力，才有所成就。並且要有專門的機關，作繼續的研究，把客觀的事實，無忌諱地暴露出來，作建立政策的張本，庶免閉門造車出門不能合轍的毛病。這次復興農村委員會創成以後，希望能够切切實實的施行復興農村的工作，今後的成績怎？　連無告的農民，正在期待自起死回生的仙丹啊！</p>
<p>上面瞎說了一些廢話，而預定的字數已經够了，就此交卷罷。　　（二二·五·九）</p>
<h3 id="c179">復興農村與農業高利貸問題 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>黃通</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>農業崩潰和農村破産，誰都知是道中國目下最嚴重的問題，因爲中國的現經濟階段，尙停滯在小生産式的農業經濟之上，「農，天下之大本民所恃以生；一本不固，邦不寗」，這一套的老八股，現在還很適用！的行政院於本月五六兩日，邀請當代名流專家，在首都開復與農村會議，通過許多方案，這確是一宗盛事，値得我們感奮的！但是，農村究如何纔能復興呢？首要的在使農民不致逃村，安居樂業：要農民安居樂業，尤先要袪除農村中剝削被剝削的生産關係。當然，中山先生的遺敎：「耕者要有其地」的奉行，是復興農村的先决而且基礎的條件。關於這個問題，範圍很大，此處不睱詳論。現在略舉農村高利貸的槪，况以覘農村中剝削關係的一小部面。　　二</p>
<p>高利貸，是放債者對於借債者，利用經濟上强弱的地位，用苛重的利率，而逹到剝削的目的，換句話說，就是重利盤剝。在現今的私産制度之下，一方有「室擁萬鎰」的富人，一方有「家徒四壁」的貧户，重利盤剝，隨處有之，固不必局限於農村；不過農村基於種種特别的原因，其情形尤爲慘酷而已。　　農村高利貸的跋扈，是因農村金融的困難；農村缺乏資金，理由很多，最主要的是資金之加速度的都市集中。年來銀行錢莊銀洋存底的激增，各通商大埠，殆英不然；而以上海爲尤甚。　埠銀兩，二十一年十一，爲數僅五千七百八十九萬兩，至今年（廿二年）一月，增至一萬四千九百五十九萬兩；增加一倍有餘。銀元一項，二十年三月，爲一萬三千三百七十九萬元；至今年一月，增至二萬二千四百十七萬元：增加一倍兩。現金循集之象，可以槪見（見楊蔭漙著中國都市金融與農村金融，新中華第一卷第八期）。近如銅元兌價之日長，焉知又不是農村現洋日缺而將銅元往外送呢？</p>
<p>他方在農村方面，農民積蓄，愈耗愈盡，中等農家的儲蓄，不逾一二十元，其上者竟至求一元之現金而不可得（見中國銀行民國二十一年度營業報告晝）！從鄉間看到，鄉農身邊，找不出幾個銅元，農村的「錢荒」，逹到如此程度，高利貸的横行，與加緊其剝削，是「勢所必至，理有固然」的！　　　三</p>
<p>農村高利貸的方式，普通可分爲金錢，牲畜，土地，物品四種。㈠金錢高利貸，除用很高的利率而行貸借者之外；也有利率照常。而於當初交欵之時。即將本金折扣者；或使立一較實際貸借數額爲高的借據，而使日後照額面償還者。此外，乘農民的窮乏，以非常低廉的代價，買收他們對於第三者的利益求權等，也屬金錢高利貸的一種。㈡牲畜高利貸者，於農民中資本較小者，一度失去其家畜，無力再</p>
<p>買時，卽利用其困窮，貸與牲畜，使之飼養。經過一定期限，通常在産生仔畜之後，將牲畜的全部頭數或價格，雙方平均分配；或貸者得</p>
<p>仔畜，借者得母畜。這種方法，從表面上看去，似無不當；但牲畜商人，每利用此項貸借的契約，於貸與時高估牲畜的代價，而於分配時則低估之，藉取逾分的利益牲畜商，人乃雄</p>
<p>於資者，常掌握一地方的買賣獨占權，而操縱</p>
<p>市價，所以他們的爲害農民，未必𪸀居人後。㈢土地高利貸者，乘中小農民或雇農等渴欲得地之時，用很高的地價，出賣其土地；或以很大的田租，出借其土地，藉博暴利者是。㈣物品高利貸者，大抵在農民與債務者有債務關係時發生，如以低廉的代價，估算農民的生産物，使充本利的代償；或以價廉的物品，用高價</p>
<p>的估算，賖售於農民，都是他們慣弄的手段。　　上述四種中，以金銀高利貸爲最多，牲畜高利貸與物品高利貸次之，土地高利貸較少。遮四種方式，並無劃然的界限，它的名目也很多，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>高利貸的弊害，早爲社會一般所公認，尤其是農村，因高利貸跋扈的結果，自耕農一降而成佃户，再降而成雇農，三降而成失業者，飢寒所迫，挺而走險，於是嘯聚山林，殺人越貨，浸假而成鄉國的大患（一部二十四史的興亡變遷，都是如此）！，人未有生而自好作亂者年來萑苻滿地，强暴遍野，大半都是環境有以造成的。欲除惡果，先去惡因，所以，高利貸的取締，是刻不容緩的！　　考高利貸和取締方法，不外二途：消極的由國家規定最高利率，執法律以相繩；積極的則廣設農業金融機關，使資金暢其流。如祇有消極的抵抗，决不能使它　跡的，何以故呢？因爲在營利主義的社會制度之下，資本要産生利息，是很自然的事實；而且利率的高低，是和企業的榮衰，資金的潤枯，有不可分的關係，决非一道命令，一紙空文，所可左右的。從前懷抱倫理思想的政治經濟學家，無一不反對貸資取利，哲人亞利斯多德，且唱貨弊不姙論（Ｂａｅｒｔｅｎ　ｔｈｅｏｒｙ　ｏｆ　ｍｃｎｅｙ），意調：貨弊是易中之具，它的本身，並無獨立的價値不能産生任何財富，所以貸借貨弊而取利息，是極不正當的。中世紀的煩瑣哲學家（Ｓｃｈｏｌａｇｔｉｋｅｒ）</p>
<p>和聖法學者）ｃａｎｏｎｉｓｔ（，以爲富裕的貸者向貧乏的借者取利，是有背上帝的命令，也主張禁止。可是他們因事實上的必要，人後便漸聞其方便之門了！敎會法（ａｎｏｎｌａｗ）上，載三例外：卽貨主對於因貸欵所蒙的損失（ＤａｍｎｕＭＥｍｅｒｇｅｎｓ）而要求賠償，對於因貸欵所喪的利益（ｌｕｃｒａｍ　ｃｓｓａｎｓ）而要求抵補對於因貨欵所冒的危險（Ｐｅｒｌｃｕｌａｍ　ｓｏｒｔｉｓ）而要求報酬均不作利息看待，得認爲正當權利了。　　其次，對於法定利率，前人也曾主張過，如十七世紀的英人蔡爾德（SｉｒJｏｓｉａｈ　ｃｈｉｌｄ），心羡荷蘭的富强，而力唱利率法定之說，以爲：荷蘭的富强，由於金利的低廉；金利的高低；並非基於外界自然的情况，乃政府可用公共的權力，自由决定的，所以政府要想富國利民，第一須用權力限制市塲的金利。但是，事實上究竟怎樣呢？民國十六年，國民黨第一百十一次的中央政治會議，曾議决最高利率，年利不得超過百分之二十，通令全國，咸使凛遵。可是事實告訴我們，一般在國民政府統治下的債主，重利盤剝，依然如故，甚且有陽奉陰違，變本加厲的。例如他們爲避免和法律的抵觸，先將利息加在本金上，或將利息先行扣去，契約上則書明「借得大洋若干元，年利「一分」的字樣。如此，官廳即欲加以取締，也無從入手了！　　如上所述：在現今私産的社會制度下，利息和利率，不能僅憑一道命令，加以禁止或限制，已屬瞭然。那末，高利貸的取締，勢非另覓積極的方法不可，積極的方法，便是廣設農業金融機關。我國農村金融機關，固有的如錢莊，典質和合會；新興的如農業銀行及農村信用合作社等，也有相當的數量。但固有的漸趨式微，大抵轉成剝削農民的工具；新興的又大抵名存實亡，力量薄弱，其眞能暢通農業信用，爲農村資助者，可說「絕無僅有」！</p>
<p>這番，復興農村委員會通過經濟組所擬的綱要，其中關於農村經濟問題，主張於合作社外，每省設一農民銀行，省中各地設立分行，並使於各縣設立農業倉庫；同時，對於各地已有典當，仍由各省盡力扶持。一方面，復商請</p>
<p>上海銀行公會，發起設立農村金融調劑委員會，對於農村金融的調劑，加以盡力輔助。可謂「綱舉目張，一絲不漏」！誠能積極地推行，則破敗垂斃的農村，未始無復興之望了！（二十二年五月十日）</p>

<p>丨牌頭，吃生活丨</p>
<p>上海是人間地獄，到處都有一種狰獰的不安的情境，一行有一行的路道，白相人，流氓，小癟三，尙白，野鷄：：都有門徑。只要你張開眼界去觀察，就有無窮的奥妙。　　馬路的轉角，游藝塲…常常可以看見鬥雄鷄一樣起脛的白相朋友，碰了他的怒，歪着頭，三角眼直視，嘴裏喊：　　儂靠啥人牌頭？</p>
<p>這樣，他告訴你有他的上峯丨丨牌頭（並非委員市長是他兄弟）是要你能否識相？老練朋友，不示弱的請敎他的「牌頭」，或者鬧了起來，不要怕，他會得說到「靑蓮閣」去坐坐，會會朋友；這樣就是他的「牌頭」·換個方法，討討饒，這來眞非通小可，捲起袖口，拿起好像人家没有的他的赤手空拳，嘴裏轉個調子：</p>
<p>喊儂吃生活：</p>
<p>這樣，你頂好是沈着應戰，看他的來勢，自己有强力，不妨先下手爲强，請他先嘗你的生活，這時候，有稱「自家人」出來排解，這個你也可就放手，也說幾句：</p>
<p>大家自家人，馬馬虎虎！</p>
<p>這樣的花頭正多來，可是我没嘗用過這套把戲，永遠的來上海，總有機會比這個更新鮮的味道嘗吧！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>舍妹今年二十一歲，從小許配於同鄉的一個農家子，九歲時，因爲母親去世，父親和我都在外謀生，我的舅父（媒人）擅自把舍妹領給對方爲童養媳。那知他翁姑來得兇悍，對舍妹百般虐待。舍妹忍無可忍，逃回娘家，並誓死不願再到婆家過活。我們見此情形，實屬可憐，乃領到上海來謀生活。一經數載，對方不聞不問，在滬戰發生的，他翁姑還置若罔聞。不料今春對方向我交涉，勒令把舍妹送回成親。先生，舍妹現</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>已抱定主張，欲與對方解除婚約。但是，對方因爲撫養舍妹數年，要求賠償損失費。看來舍妹不回家去成親，對方不會放鬆我；如不承認損失費，這事要變成僵局；或者向我提起訴訟。左思右想，不知如何是好。恭請代我擇一條出路。則萬分感激！敬請撰安，夏渠謹上。</p>
<p>×　　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：照來信看來，令妹的對方，似乎不能算爲頑固。他們對於解約一層，雖没有明白地贊成，但是旣有償還損失的要求，就可認爲允許的暗示。令妹與對方，在解約之後，當然絲毫没有關係，那末對方就没有撫養的義務。他們要求賠償損失，是名正言順的事。至於舅父擅自領去一層，你們當時旣不立即反對，採取有效行爲，現在是不能借此卸責的。同時虐待一層，倘使執有眞憑實據，足以證明絕對不堪過活時，當然可以認爲對方之過失，而要求無條件解約。現在時隔多年，物證消滅，人證不可憑信，委實無從追溯了。所以這件事，最好將他們要求賠償損失的證件保存；婚約是一定可以解除的，不過損失也是一定要償還他們的。解約自解約，賠償自賠償，分頭進行。　　至於賠償方面，有兩點可以措商。㈠數目的論定；講到撫養的费用，大有出入，每年自十餘元至百元左右，均可謂爲合理。最好請一個公正人做中間人，參照他家生活狀况，妥爲論定。㈡履行之商榷；照來信看來，夏君似非富裕之人，一時何來此巨欵，應商諸對方，分期拔付。這件事情，鬧到後來，即使對簿公庭，結果也逃不了「兩造婚約，准予解除；女方應賠償男方損失銀若干（由法官衡情酌定）。至於交付辦法，是一種執行問題，也是一種事實問題。萬一眞正拿不出來，也逃不了分期交付的辦法，究不致押交的地步呢！不過憑心而論，這筆損失；·是應當償還的；所以在數字論定之後·夏君應當竭力地籌劃。倘使故意欺詐，意圖抵賴，是不行的。</p>

<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>許多人都說常做夢是腦經衰弱的形像：然而不做夢罷，却又太覺苦悶。我是一個弱者，便不得不被這個聊勝於無的安慰克服了！這幾日來，差不多夜夜做夢。</p>
<p>㈠</p>
<p>我站在大地上傲然而視，遠望千山萬水，都隱約在雲霧之中，眼前所見，惟有赤土千里，一望無際而已。我彷徨前進，我又回頭四顧；覺天地之大，在在都是危機，陰謀，損人利己。這裏雖然無人，可是你能肯定地說你的面前斷不會有一個陷阱麽？獅吼虎嘯，漸漸的近了。</p>
<p>不知何時，在我的眼前推出了一座高山，這山的四周，融融地放着萬道金光；我眼爲之眩，頭爲之暈，無疑地這上面住的都是仙神一流了？</p>
<p>我勉强支持着向前行走，金光却隨了我的脚步而縮小了；至終，我走到高山的下面，而金光也就消滅於鳥有。</p>
<p>這裏，我坐在石上，仰面而望。我看見有資本家鞭笞工人，我看見有盜賊等白晝搶刦：我也看見兵士們自相殘殺；我更看見人們蒙着假面具，互相詐騙……一切的一切，我都覺得失望了。生活在金光中的人類，不是同普天下的人類一樣的麽？我心爲之碎！所謂仙神也者，不過如此而已！　　我咒詛人們，我更其是咒詛高山上的人們：我無力地立起身來，茫然前行。和風徐徐，大海中微波輕漾，浮萍兒你將飄至何處去啊！</p>
<p>金光隨脚而生，　回頭時，早已高照萬丈了。無論奸盜，無論殺刦，什麽都籠罩在金光之中；從表面看去，祇覺得一片紫氣，朶朶祥雲。唉！虚僞！虚僞！我恨你，我咒你！你殺盡了人類的心了，你弄髒乾凈的土地了！這世界都是你的勢力，到那兒再去找一片天眞？</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>我孑然一身，獨行於萬人之中。嘈雑的人聲，在四圍嗡嗡地響着。有幾個好似面熟的人，對我耳邊說道：［厚英，公理失敗了！」我一驚，回頭問道：「眞的麽？」然而他們不回答，掦掦自去。</p>
<p>我心中懊惱，如將受死刑之罪犯！　　隆隆的砲聲，不絕於耳：烟霧在四面勝起，把作戰的兵士都蒙住了。他們不知道是和誰戰，我也不知道誰和誰戰？</p>
<p>萬衆人民，在空中搖旗呐喊；漸漸的他們分成兩派了。很淸楚的，東面的旗幟上標着「强權」兩字；而西面的旗幟上却飄掦着「公理」。但是，可憐哪！公理的下面只不過寥寥站了二三個曲腰彎背的人物！</p>
<p>不用說，「公理」敗退了。　　在堅持不决的時候，我看見從「强權」那面跳出幾個戴着假面具裝出滿面笑容的人來；他們站在交戰的中心點，意思似要講和。但是我看見他們的内心，滿懷着要吃掉這二三個「擁扶公理」者</p>
<h3 id="c189">痛呀！重傷！國恥五月五五五五卅希遠 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>！「公理」失敗了，他們在空中拍手歡呼；我不忍再覩，回身便走。</p>
<p>「强權」漸漸地降下來，把我抓上雲端中去了。我心中雖驚，但我神志尙淸；因此我也没有呼喊求饒。</p>
<p>恍惚中，他們把我擲下來了！</p>

<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>前天本刋上彭年君的賣文生涯，作者處同等的地位，感到出賣心血是最悽苦的行業，不少文人在字行之間流露不敢高聲的呐喊。一個作家，無論成名未成名，他們寫文章時，絞自已的腦汁是一樣的。成名作家的作品固然較無名易容出賣；價格也可以提髙，但是成名後也有成名的難處。他們的腦汁結晶品，不像無名的可以提起筆來胡亂塗寫，因爲他們的作品已被人注意，他們要抓住人家對他的信仰心，一篇作品問世，動筆時不能不鄭重，如其稍失檢點，較以前的作品退步，便遭嫉妬者的一頓臭駡。中國文壇上的「批評」，根本由批評者與作者的感情轉移：同派的捧爲××精心傑作，反對者駡得狗疵不如。所以一位成名作家往往一年半載始有薄薄的一冊書出版。</p>
<p>至於無名作家，你想擠上咱們的文壇，那是難，難，第三個還是難。他們都以各報附刋爲嘗試地，雖然比較容易發表，但是落筆的時候先明瞭各種附刋的宗旨，應投其所好，不能背道而馳。稿件寄出以後，天天眼巴巴的望着自己的大名是否一登龍門，今日復明日，那失望與期待的滋味，只過來人心領神會，恕作心有餘而力不足，去描寫這又驚</p>
<p>又喜的心理狀態。試想自己滿以爲出人頭地的佳作，被編輯關進字紙簏，心中自然憤懣。如其再三碰壁之後，遷怒於編輯先生的不生眼珠，崇拜偶像，照顧朋友，這一點就是編輯先生的無妄之災了。許多人說：「當編輯只要有欣賞文字力就夠了！」本人不怕臉厚，也做過三個月的附刋編輯，除了欣賞文字力之外，須具「眼觀四處耳聽八方」的本領。更要受得駡，忍得氣，否則請君下野。編輯的崇拜偶像，我雖不能代表編輯全體承認，多少是不可免的事實。（請問佛君以爲然否？）朋友來的稿子照顧一點，大槪也不致於事出無因吧，並不是編者不怕駡，這正是做編輯難的地方！　　稿件的取捨，須跟時代，趁潮流，迎合讀者，但有時「魚與熊掌皆吾所欲也」，而篇幅有限，忍痛割愛，以致寃沉海底者，比比皆是，駡的人確不肯放鬆你。投稿不易，編輯亦難！</p>

<p>編者按：刑事政策，在上古時，代採取報復主義；至中古時代，則採取鎭壓主義，不惜嚴刑峻法，以爲懲一儆百之計。近世人道主義，日漸昌明，刑事政策，乃亦採用感化主義。除少數「悔改難期」之罪犯，判處死刑外；餘均處以徒刑有差。在執行期内，施以感化敎育，其最高原則，則在「使犯人在出獄後，仍爲社會中堅之一員」。故對於犯人之身心兩方，必須兼　並顧。各地監獄，雖因便於管理起見，定有各種規程；但終不能違反此項原則。胡君所說的那個監獄，規定「家族探望，至多每月不得過一次」或許是有的；但對於病犯，一定另有規定，以資救濟。不過不肖的獄吏，見你們不懂法規，故意刁難，想弄幾個錢罷了。爲今之計，應具狀法院，申請釋外就醫；另外請一位律師丨不必十分有名的，致多費金錢！同往探　視。有了一位熟悉法律的作伴，獄吏就不敢作弊了。</p>

<p>小范朋克近日運氣眞不好。他自與瓊克勞馥宣告脫輻之後，現在又被一位德國的歌星，名喬　提治（ＪｏｒｇｅｎＤｉｅｔｚ）的控告他誘惑他的前妻，以致離婚，并要求賠償損失六萬元。但是小范朋克態度亦很倔强。他說這事完全敲竹槓，并且說以前電影明星，時時被人家拆梢敲竹槓，明明自己無罪，但爲息事寗人起見，情願出些錢私自和解。但他却要從此振作一下打破此種陋習，當然好萊塢有許多人，很盼望小范朋克能勝利，因爲他有許多證據，可以證明這件事的雙方，實有敲竹槓的嫌疑。　　小范朋克說：「我和喬根提治的前妻阿爾瑪泰爾瑪，是認識的。我們曾在攝影塲會見過，如同我和無千無萬其他的男男女女一樣。但是要說我要從千萬女人之中，將她挑選出來，作我的甜心，或未來的妻，那還談不到呢我不能每次遇到一個女人，和她談幾句話，就算我已經允許她结婚也」。　　當第一次喬根提治第一次說小范朋克勾引他的妻，要他出錢和解的時候，喬根曾去見范的經理先生。他說范必須拿出錢來，因爲范使他失妻而必須重娶，但他没有婚費。范的經理聽了喬根提治的話，明知他的目的是在敲竹槓，所以决定不給錢，情願打官司。但是那位經理先生，爲愼重起見、就去和一位地方檢察官相商，並由地方檢察官派人調查此事。後來喬根提治又帶了一個女人，名呌露惜都蘭的，那女人在喬根提治和阿爾瑪泰爾瑪離婚後，就嫁給喬根提治了，他們新夫婦來到小范朋克處，硬要將價値三百元的珍飾，作價六千元售給小范朋克。當時地方檢察官的代表都在塲親見此事，結果小范朋克和他的經理願出一千五百元購買。喬根提治答應了，立即付給支票一紙，雙方具結和解此案。但是喬根提治夫婦二人出門之後，就被地方檢察官的代表傅去問話了。因此喬根提治就控告小范朋克，要求賠償失妻損失費五千元。又無故被拘損失費千元，共六千元。</p>
<p>小范朋克說：「如果我有罪，我當然情願出幾千塊錢了結此案。但這事完全係拆梢性質，我豈肯屈服，須知我爲此案所費去的光陰和律師費，决不止區區數千元也。」</p>
<h3 id="c193">評爆發機 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>劇情導演表情攝影都臻上乘</p>
<p>南京大戲院昨天開映福克斯公司的「爆發機」是一部很有蕭伯訥作風的諷刺人生的好影片。這本電影劇情的幽默。導演的圓滿。表演的自然。攝影的技巧和光綫的柔和都臻了上乘。「爆發機」的片名，看來似乎是一本「驚心動魄」的神怪片，實際上並不是這一回事。</p>
<p>本片的編劇分做兩個段落，前部一小段可說是序幕，叙述美國少年羅柏游於巴黎，因撞車而與一麗姝伊麗諾邂逅。這美國少年爲戀愛的追求而潛登郵船，於是本片就引入後部的一大段，也就是「爆發機」的正劇。「爆發機」的正劇以一艘乘風破浪的大輪船爲背影，以大輪船上各式各樣的旅客爲劇中人，變幻莫測的人生就此自然地能夠描寫出來，其取材與「大飯店」相仿。　　「爆發機」的取材利用人類貪生惡死的弱點爲主旨，以船上無線電員假造的電報說夜半有人陰謀炸毁這船一點暗示人類心理中的世界末日，於是患痼疾將死透船長啦，獸醫敎授啦，剝削貧民的財主啦，年老怕死的姑母啦，嗓子乾脆的歌女啦！各個乘客互相猜疑着，各别的表現出腦海裏隱藏着的一個世界末日將至的恐懼。以及人類在生死關頭所應顯露的種種醜態。人類自私自利的劣根性就此發揮無遺。</p>
<p>玫瑰花是有刺的，情途是多荆棘的，「爆發機」影片裏羅柏和伊麗諾的戀愛也是根據這個意思描寫着曲折而自然。有許多電影明星如約翰巴里摩之類只會板着面孔做戲，有許多電影明星如雷門那伐樂之類老是喜開着臉表演，本片裏的小生吉士德馬烈斯飾美國少年做來有說有笑，很能維持他原來表演的身分。其餘的演員，如琴娜　陶屏飾伊麗諾，都能表演出劇中人各别的品性。在對白之中，插着幾幕無聲的片段叙出劇中各人的身世，比到一幕一幕的介紹。。省事的多，至於片中的對白，固然很俏皮，但覺得太多一些。本片最合戲劇的一點還在虚懸着一個世界末日的要旨，在於把船上的一種疑懼抓住，一幕緊一幕的描寫出來，最後發覺這不過是一個空中樓閣的虚驚。</p>
<h3 id="c194">評「脂粉市塲」 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>聲片中較好的作品</p>
<p>導演有顯著的進步</p>
<p>明星公司在「女性的呐喊」中提出了婦女解放的問題之後，在這個「脂粉市塲」又重新提出這一問題來了。我們不會忘記，在「女性的呐喊」中聽着了小資産階級女性痛苦的哀號，但是一點也没有「呐喊」出來。那末這一問題的再提出，在「脂粉市塲」中是怎樣解决的呢？在劇情的進展中很明白的告訴我們說：李翠芬在她的家庭經濟完全破産的時候，她從優美的學生生活中跑出來，到百貨商店中當店員。她受着了人們的侮辱，受着人們的訕笑或諷刺，於是她爲了維</p>
<p>護她的「淸淸白白的良家女子」的身份而决心不幹。但是生活的鞭子不住的鞭撻着她，同時受了楊小姐的啓示，仍然得繼續奮鬥，於是揀茶，抄寫，了電話接線並且她希望在自己的艱苦中走向光明的前途。假如劇情就是這樣終結，無疑的它是把握了現實，并且說明了在現實社會中所謂「男女平等」只是騙人的話。也就是婦女解放的問題在現實社會中是没有方法解决。但是，本劇却不是這樣終止，它却使李翠芬居然在極微薄的個人的收入中，除了對付了一家三口的日常支出之外，還能夠在銀行中儲蓄，最後甚至於開起一家洋貨店，母女二人樂享太平。</p>
<p>很顯然的這是謳歌現實社會的作品，完全抺煞目前最爲嚴重的經濟恐慌，特别是粉飾了目前國民經濟幾乎完全陷於破産的實情。老實說誰也不能相信一個女工居然能積蓄起來。以黃金色的夢來解釋勞働婦女的前途，我想「狂流」的編劇者丁謙平先生總不至於如此夢想吧　　導演張石川在本片中多少可以看出進步的痕迹，至少比「失戀」的技術進步。可是因爲太注重演員表情的緣故，總覺得對話和表演不大聯貫。然而鏡頭很好。特别是幾個大寫。</p>
<p>佈景在店員的寓所中是失敗，的决不應當那樣華美。收音還好。對白有些很勉强，仍是那樣突然的「黑暗」「光明」的空喊。字幕很適當。攝影也很好。諸演員多半總還過得去，但總嫌鬆懈。整個的說，在中國的聲片中技巧是較好的，總不至於使人太失望。</p>

<p>— 康冰</p>
<p>「我從在加拿大中學的時候，許多同學打算在週末去划船。」瑙瑪希拉說「但是前一天的晚上，我做着一個奇異的夢。我沉在河裏，我的母親想來救我，亦連帶落水。幸而有一個陌生人來救起了我們。這人左邊的面頰上，有着一個很深的創痕。我就這樣嚇醒了。」</p>
<p>「這夢境很淸爽，這一夜我就未曾閉目。明天早晨我就覺得不是好兆，我母親以爲最好安居家中，勿去划船爲妙。」</p>
<p>「那天下午他們去划船，我没有去。後來風浪很大，船觸礁了。許多朋友都落在河裏，而因此生病了。我一個最親近的女友病得很重。說來也很奇怪，她在星期四的晚上，也做着和我同様的惡夢，但她不在意。更使我驚異的，當那船主來探望她的時候，他的面容竟和我夢中所見的人一樣，左邊面頰上也有</p>
<p>着一個很深的創痕。」</p>

<p>「要是這樣的話，請你放心好了。我丈夫的意旨，我是絕對不肯阻擋的。」</p>
<p>「這樣很好，謝謝你。」麥汀納茲高興極了。她好似打了大勝仗，欣欣然地走出去。但她還没有出去的時候，約翰已經氣喘喘地跑進來了。他進來先喊了一聲「曼麗」！但是麥汀納茲裝出許多媚態，告訴他曼麗已答應讓他自由。約翰問道「自由讓我自由」？他瞪著眼望著曼麗。</p>
<p>麥汀納茲說：「是的，我愛，你自由了，可以娶我了那不好嗎！」　　「曼麗」！約翰失聲喊道。但是曼麗直立不動，默然無聲地看著他。約翰又回過頭去抓住了麥汀納茲的手臂怒斥道：「你告訴她些什麽？你胡說些什麽？你說出來！</p>
<p>「約翰，不要這樣」！曼麗低聲地勸戒她的丈。約翰聽見了。就立刻將麥汀納茲的手臂放下了望後退了一步。麥汀納茲接著說道？「我告訴她你愛我你情願娶我你要有自由這都是胡說嗎」？麥汀納茲眼中露着一些驕矜的樣子。　　這都是胡說的！這些說，還有許多别的話，都是我說的瞎話」！　　　那女子的態度立刻變了樣子，怒目瞪着約翰道；「好，當了自己妻子的面，就這樣了」！　　「你呌我跪在上帝的面前，我亦是這樣說法。我和你說的都是昏暓時候的胡說。我們從此斷絕關係了，過去了，没有了。」</p>
<p>麥汀納茲聽了，如同背上澆了一盆冷水。她怒氣勃勃地道：「這就是一位正人君子，他還想做一省的省長呢！哼，我到可以將這事表白表白了。你知道不知，我要呌你身敗名裂，並不是難事」她說完了眼中兇光四射逼視著約翰。　　「曉得」曼麗平聲靜氣地道「他深知道。」　　「這段事情登在報紙上，到是一段好新聞。我呌你做不成省長」！麥汀納茲說著，又回過身來，對著曼麗道；「卡頓夫人，你的丈夫你儘管留著他罷，祇要你情願要他」。　　「這樣很好謝謝你」曼麗拿數分以前麥汀納茲的口吻答復她，其中有無窮的意味，在兩個婦人的心中，發生不同的感覺。麥汀納茲退了出去。約翰開了門，羞慚滿面地對著他的愛妻，但是曼麗並不責備他。她說這件事，她早就知道了。她並且知道她的丈夫。雖在數千里外，被女子美色迷惑得神志昏暓的時候，亦未曾一刻忘記過家中的愛妻。這樣一說直使約翰感激她到萬分。（未完）</p>

<p>Tokyo. Last night, the Russian ambassador met with Foreign Minister Uchida. It is said that the Russian ambassador proposed to Uchida that if the "Manchukuo" authorities decide to purchase the Chinese Eastern Railway, then Soviet Russia could recognize "Manchukuo." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Foreign Ministry previously, due to uncertainty about the facts, only submitted a note to the Soviet government, urging it to pay attention to China's interests and the provisions of the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. Subsequently, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov publicly declared while meeting with reporters that China had lost its rights under the 1924 agreement and frankly admitted that it was preparing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet government's determination to violate the treaty and harm China's legitimate rights and interests was thus undoubtedly clear. In order to safeguard national rights and the dignity of the treaty, our Foreign Ministry telegraphed Ambassador Yan on the evening of the 13th, instructing him to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet government. It is said that the content of the protest referred to Ambassador Yan's conversation with Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan on the 11th and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov's statement in the newspaper on the same day, stating that the Chinese government was deeply surprised by the opinions expressed by the Soviet authorities. Because these opinions not only show the Soviet government's complete disregard for treaty obligations, but also show the Soviet government's intention to conclude illegal acts with an illegal organization. In the note delivered by Ambassador Yan to the Soviet Foreign Commissar on May 9th, the respective positions of the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, based on the 1924 agreement, were clearly pointed out. In Article 9, Section 2 of the "Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues" concluded by the two countries on May 31, 1924, the Soviet government promised that the Chinese government would continue to redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway, and never promised that any other government or force could acquire the railway. Furthermore, the provisions of Section 5 of the same article are very clear, that is, the future of the Chinese Eastern Railway can only be determined by China and Russia, and no third party is allowed to interfere. Therefore, contrary to the opinion held by the Soviet Foreign Commissar, the Soviet Union absolutely has no right to transfer all its rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway to any party it wishes to transfer them to in any way. Furthermore, the Chinese government should ask the Soviet government to pay attention to the promises made by the Chinese and Soviet governments to each other in Article 4, Section 2 of the above-mentioned agreement, that is, neither of the contracting governments shall conclude treaties or agreements that harm the sovereignty and interests of the other contracting government. Recently, the Chinese government has been unable to participate in the management of the Chinese Eastern Railway due to the pressure of superior military force, but China has never and will never give up any treaty or sovereign interests it has in the railway. This change caused by the situation and for which China cannot be held responsible temporarily hinders China from exercising its right to manage the railway, but it does not affect the validity of the terms of the 1924 agreement or the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Chinese government absolutely cannot recognize the Soviet Union's current right to dispose of the Chinese Eastern Railway without China's consent, just as China's consent is needed when the Chinese and Soviet authorities jointly manage the railway. There is no difference. The Chinese government expresses its approval of the Soviet government's desire to maintain peace, but the Chinese government must point out that the current situation in Manchuria is recognized by the whole world as being caused by military aggression. This intimidation is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928, and the Soviet Union is one of the contracting parties to the Pact. All civilized countries have guaranteed that they will not grant legal or de facto recognition to this puppet organization. Now, without China's consent, and under the current circumstances, abruptly transferring an important means of transportation in Manchuria in the manner proposed by the Soviet authorities is tantamount to the Soviet authorities recognizing an organization declared illegal by the international community and providing assistance to the aggressor. Once this plan is completed, it will be contrary to the Soviet government's declared desire for peace. Based on the above-mentioned legal and political reasons, the Chinese government has to lodge a very serious protest against the Soviet government's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway and earnestly hopes that the Soviet government will reconsider its attitude towards this issue in accordance with the 1924 agreement. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After the Soviet Russian government proposed to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Far Eastern political situation of the four countries of China, Japan, Russia, and [Manchuria] will undergo rapid changes. In order to deal with this situation, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking liaison with the military and all other parties, and is enriching the content of the Asian Bureau to consider all-encompassing strategies. Although the reason for the Russian proposal seems to be to remove the root cause of disputes between Russia and Manchuria, Russia's revolutionary diplomacy has never allowed other countries to be optimistic. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that accepting the Russian proposal wholesale is extremely dangerous. Therefore, whether "Manchukuo" or the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) should purchase it has not yet been decided. It will be decided after further observing the attitude of Soviet Russia. It is unclear what the true intention of Russia's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway is this time. However, it cannot be denied that the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy is gradually turning to a disadvantageous position. The fact that the Soviet Union is abandoning the Chinese Eastern Railway may indicate that the Soviet Union is retreating from the Maritime Province. From this point of view, the sale of the northern half of Sakhalin in the future may also be realized. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is determined to implement a policy towards Russia with a proactive and tough attitude, based on the fundamental principle of Far Eastern autonomous diplomacy. (Tokyo dispatch, 14th) Tokyo. Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan handed a memorandum to Ambassador Ota on April 16th to be forwarded to the Japanese government, drawing Japan's attention to the Eastern Railway and wanting to involve Japan in the Eastern Railway issue. The embassy stationed in "Manchukuo" was ordered to investigate the truth. Now that the investigation has been completed, it is clear that the Russian side's statement is completely unfounded. The drafting of a rebuttal response to the memorandum has begun. It is said that the gist of the response is as follows: (1) The Imperial government's policy of protecting Soviet Russian interests in "Manchuria" will not change in the future. However, since "Manchukuo" is already independent, the Japanese government cannot be responsible for the actions of "Manchukuo" officials based on their sovereignty. If it is attributed to the responsibility of Japanese officials in "Manchukuo", it would be a misunderstanding. (2) The dispute over the Eastern Railway is an action taken by "Manchukuo" in accordance with its right to supervise within its own country and has nothing to do with the Empire. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why a protest is being lodged with the Imperial government. (3) However, regarding the Eastern Railway blockade incident and the issue of vehicle ownership, the Imperial government believes that there is no need to respond. However, according to the Imperial government's investigation, Soviet Russia's cutting off the connection between Outer Baikal and the Eastern Railway is an infringement of "Manchukuo's" sovereignty, and the documents published by "Manchukuo" are considered to be correct. (4) It is inappropriate to allege that the fees for the transportation of Imperial troops on the Eastern Railway have not been paid. The reason is that a portion of the fees has already been paid, and the remaining fees have been temporarily postponed due to the fact that the reduction rate for vehicle transportation fees has not yet been decided. (5) The allegations in Karakhan's memorandum are all based on misunderstandings, and the Imperial government has no choice but to dismiss them all at once. However, the Japanese government hopes that the Russian-"Manchukuo" question will be resolved as soon as possible and that friendly relations between Russia, Japan and "Manchukuo" will be maintained and promoted.

<p>Harbin. Today's Harbin Times predicts that the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications will restrict the powers of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors and evenly distribute the management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Ministry of Communications will also dismiss troublemakers on the railway, revise freight rates, and reorganize the management bureau. As a result, the Ministry of Communications will actually control the management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In the future, the Board of Directors will be composed of five Russian and five "Manchukuo" directors, with a "Manchukuo" person as the chairman and a Russian as the vice chairman. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Harbin. The "Manchukuo" authorities and the Russian representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Konitzky, met for two and a half hours yesterday afternoon, but the results of the talks have not yet been announced. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Harbin. Two Russians recently arrested in Manchuli by the "Manchukuo" authorities have now been brought to this place. One is Apanovich and the other is Malerfanye. According to police circles, a map of the Manchurian military was found on the two men. The two men are currently being investigated by the police authorities and are expected to be charged with military espionage. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Harbin. It is said that some Soviet Russians in Suifenhe have retreated into Russian territory, reporting that the Soviet Russians have again received warnings to withdraw from "Manchukuo." Rumors here are that the Soviet Russians will launch a strike on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The police are seriously searching the residences of communists. It is also rumored that the "Manchukuo" authorities have shipped 10,000 pairs of handcuffs to Harbin. This incident has caused panic among the Russian side. Konitzky, the Russian representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, guarantees that there will be no strike. The police have stopped the search. The situation in Harbin last night was very tense. The police were all fully armed and patrolling the streets, but the night was peaceful. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Peiping. The situation on the front lines has changed today. On the eastern front, the vanguard of our army, in the vicinity of Leizhuang and Guye, He Zhuguo has moved to Xugezhuang to take command, and Wan Fulin has also moved to Lutai. Luanzhou was penetrated by enemy troops on the Pingyu Highway, forming a salient. The troops in that area have been retreating one after another since late last night. The enemy troops advancing along the Pingyu Highway are only twenty miles from Fengrun, and the situation is tense. (Special)</p>
<p>Luanzhou. The superior enemy launched a westward attack across the Luan River. After fierce battles on the 12th and 13th, the Luan River line was breached in the Qian'an area. The enemy is still concentrating all its efforts on attacking westward, with one part detouring to the Pingda Highway and pressing on Fengrun, and another part heading towards Zunhua. This morning, the sound of artillery was intense northwest of Guye Station. There was a fierce battle in the northeast area of Zhenzi Town on the Pingyu Highway. This place is about forty miles from Tangshan. Our army changed to a new position and defended the second line with all its strength, trying to counterattack the enemy against the water.

He's division was the first to be threatened, and the division dispatched troops in an attempt to save the situation. Unfortunately, Shen's division completely collapsed, and the flanks were attacked. After several hand-to-hand combats, it was ultimately unsuccessful due to the disparity in weapons. The enemy then approached the left side of Zhang's division, so reinforcements were added to the left wing of Zhang's division, using the night to attack the enemy, in an attempt to save the critical situation. Unexpectedly, the melee lasted all night and failed. One part of our force that advanced towards Liuzhuang by night repeatedly encountered obstacles from the defeated soldiers of Shen's division. This morning, the enemy launched a combined attack on our two units with infantry, artillery, air, and armored vehicles. In the end, due to heavy casualties, it was unable to hold on and has now withdrawn to the rear for reorganization. Subsequently, 囗 division was added, hoping to reverse the battle. Unfortunately, it was attacked by the enemy's armored vehicles and bombed by airplanes. Although it fought fiercely with the enemy for half a day, it was dispersed due to casualties. Weng's division was isolated and engaged in melee warfare with the enemy. At the same time, the enemy facing Wang's army also increased successively. With the danger of the rear being cut off by the enemy moving south, it was decided to withdraw to the right bank of the Zhi River in order to continue the resistance in cooperation with friendly forces.

At this time of grave national crisis, if another civil war breaks out, how can those responsible for local military and political affairs face the people? The central government is currently investigating the facts, first clarifying right and wrong, to</p>
<p>punish the chief culprits. In short, regarding the Sichuan war, every effort must be made to prevent it from</p>
<p>happening. Even if the military leaders in that region dare to act recklessly and fight among themselves, effective measures will be taken to deal with them. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, from the representative offices in Nanjing of various Sichuan generals: They stated that the recent bad weather has interfered with the radio stations, resulting in no telegrams arriving in Nanjing. However, Xie Tianmin, the representative of Tian Songyao, received a telegram from Tian stating that Liu Wenhui, disregarding the severity of the national crisis, had arbitrarily invaded our military defense areas and had been sternly instructed to stop. If he disregards everything and commits another offense, then there will be no choice but to meet him with a severe attack. According to a telegram from Liu Xiang in Chongqing, he also hopes for a firm halt to the war and, if necessary, will resort to armed mediation. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, from Wang Yinchun, the representative of the 28th Army of Deng Xihou: During last year's Sichuan war, almost all military leaders adopted a confrontational attitude towards Liu Wenhui, but Deng mediated. The swift cessation of the Sichuan war was largely due to Deng's efforts. Now, Liu has once again clashed with Deng over defense areas. Who is starting the war is clear to the people.

<p>Nanjing: The Rural Revitalization Plan was passed by the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 13th.

(2) Maintain the integrity of the original administrative system. Departments with original supervising agencies should be handled by the supervising agencies. Departments without supervising agencies should find ways to incorporate them into the existing administrative system. (3) The central and local governments should do their utmost to eliminate all obstacles to rural revitalization. (4) Efforts should be made to complete the coordination of all domestic agencies related to rural areas. (5) The central and local governments should reorganize the original agricultural agencies and funding. As a principle, no new agencies should be added and no additional funding should be increased unless there is a special need. (6) Every effort should be made to utilize existing personnel in the agencies. If insufficient, experts may be specially hired or contracted. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Fukuoka: Matsuoka Yosuke, who arrived in Kyushu, was outraged when he read in the newspaper that Sir Austen Chamberlain of the United Kingdom had stated in the House of Lords that economic sanctions should be imposed on Japan. He issued the following statement in the form of a public question: Sir Austen Chamberlain is a gentleman whose character is truly admirable, but his opinion cannot be accepted. I previously met with Sir, and we exchanged views on the Manchurian issue, but we did not reach an agreement before parting. Sir advocated that world peace should be organized under the League of Nations, but Japan cannot entrust matters concerning its own safety to the League of Nations or other national entities. Therefore, this kind of thoughtless idealism is truly enough to disrupt world peace. Those who say that an economic blockade against Japan can be implemented are no different from inciting a second world war. I wonder how Sir considers this point and would like to hear his opinion. To put it frankly, this kind of words and actions are harmful to world peace and offer no benefit. I hope he will speak cautiously. (14th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Declaring an Extremely Urgent Time <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Is to enter a wartime state, different from peacetime. Since the September 18th Incident, Liaoning and Jilin have been lost, and Heilongjiang Province is on the verge of danger. The nation's territory has been divided, and the people have been ravaged. At that time, we entered a state of extreme emergency. In reason and in urgency, we could not afford to steal a moment of leisure. But the authorities took uncertain measures. The people were not effectively directed. As a result, the disaster spread. The three northeastern provinces were lost, followed by Rehe. Recently, Japanese militarism has actually used our country's extremely moderate resistance as an excuse to launch a large-scale military operation. In addition to the existing five divisions stationed in the northeast, namely the 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 14th Divisions, two cavalry brigades, two mixed brigades, six special garrison units, and other special forces, they have again added two divisions and restored the Lushun naval port. Their challenge is extremely obvious. It does not require divination. When the Japanese army pretended to retreat from eastern Luan, this newspaper wrote an article exposing their conspiracy, pointing out that they would attack Zhangdu and invade Gubeikou. Now, the facts prove that the Japanese army has concentrated its 7th, 8th, and 6th Divisions along the Great Wall, using the 8th Division as the main force to attack and seize Gubeikou, the 7th Division as the main force to attack Xifengkou, and the 6th Division as the main force to invade eastern Luan. From eastern Tianjin to Nantianmen, all have fallen into a state of war. The ancient city of Beiping cannot avoid being threatened by airplanes and feeling the urgency of war. At this time when enemy forces run rampant and the crisis is imminent, even if we try to seek peace and maintain a state of peacetime, can it be achieved? Furthermore, the conflict between the Hui and Han in Xinjiang may come to a temporary end due to Jin Shuren's escape. However, the crisis remains. The rifts have not been eliminated. Even if it comes to an end now, it will certainly not be a long-term solution. Moreover, the powerful neighbors are waiting for an opportunity, and there are still many internal troubles. In addition, Tibet is unsettled, which has been the case for a long time. At this moment, we cannot arbitrarily judge it as "establishing itself."</p>
<p>But the tendency to separate is an undeniable fact. Xinjiang accounts for nearly one-eighth of the total area of ​​the country. Tibet is rich in mineral resources. All of them are the future treasures of our country. Then the current events cannot be ignored. However, looking back at the domestic situation, the rural areas of this country are too ruined. The society is also extremely tired. Few people have hope for the future. Everyone only cares about the present. So-called relief is extremely slow and cannot solve the urgent needs of the moment. More importantly, it cannot stimulate the public's hope for the future. Opening up a new future in the darkness and pointing out the direction. What is even worse is that the youth who will bear the heavy responsibilities of the country in the future are now also going with the flow. A few people cannot correct the momentary mistakes of the majority. They are also intoxicated with dreams, enjoying temporary pleasures, and forgetting the misfortunes of a hundred years. Therefore, the enemy can wantonly invade and act recklessly.</p>
<p>In the future, if the understanding between Britain and the United States is established, international cooperation in capitalism may have considerable use. The competition with Japan will be limited to economic competition. The brutal act of invading China by force will inevitably become more intense. The Soviet Union, in order to pursue its traditional peaceful diplomacy, must maintain its past relations with Japan. In the international arena, our country will become more isolated. Even calls for moral assistance will decline. So what will we do? The only way is to boost our spirits and use all our abilities to regenerate ourselves.</p>
<p>First, from the government to the general public, we should immediately wash away the mistakes of the past and deeply recognize the current disaster. At this time when the enemy army is deeply entrenched and it is impossible to seek good fortune by fluke, we must quickly determine a major plan. (It is impossible to force a peace. What's more, the Japanese warlords are greedy and insatiable. It is impossible to buy short-term peace with daughters, jade, and silk.) Fighting with our backs to the city is the time. Therefore, internally, we should strive to overcome internal contradictions and eliminate disputes that are contrary to the public interest. Take the national struggle as the center and control others. Then, the scattered masses will be easier to gather, and the timid will also stand up when they hear the news. Only then can we suppress the great powers and stop Japan's aggression. Second, whether it is the government or the public, we should first unify our steps and issue an extremely urgent organization. Even if we cannot implement national general mobilization like advanced countries, the upper-level architecture of politics, military affairs, etc., must strive to be agile and powerful. It not only can command its subordinates but also can effectively lead the people in emergency response plans. The production of mobilization must also progress simultaneously with military mobilization, reaching the countryside to plan for national survival with the power of the group, and to control industry and revitalize the countryside. Only then can we fight a mortal battle with the enemy who invades us. Third, although education is slow to take effect, it is the fundamental plan of the country. It should be transformed into emergency education. We must also change the current injection-style education to universal mass education, so that the general adult can immediately transfer to the front line and serve the nation's war. Command the young to become a strong reserve force and bear the heavy responsibility of reviving China. The current war, even if it "fails", if the whole country strives together, the recent future will be able to reverse the decline, compete with the enemy for the final survival, and avenge our humiliation.</p>

<h3 id="e58">German Representative Suddenly Returns to Berlin; General Discussion on Disarmament Postponed <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Key to Success or Failure Lies in Germany's Attitude</p>
<p>Germany Persists in Three Major Principles of Disarmament</p>
<p>Hitler Will Make a Statement to the Parliament</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th, Reuters: The German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadorni, decided to leave for Berlin tonight to attend the parliamentary meeting. Therefore, Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, has decided to postpone the general discussion of the Disarmament Conference from next Monday to next Thursday. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Simon may come to Geneva to attend the meeting to be held on Thursday. Geneva, 13th, Reuters: The sudden return of German representative Nadorni to the Disarmament Conference in Berlin has delayed the discussion of the Disarmament Conference again. Everyone is quite dissatisfied and indignant. However, all parties are now keeping silent, thinking that it is appropriate to wait quietly for Hitler to make any remarks in the parliament before deciding on a direction. Berlin, 13th, Reuters: The seriousness of Germany's position in world politics is the main topic of discussion among people here. The stock exchange has now felt this impact and has repeatedly encountered setbacks. A semi-official arena here has now published an article aimed at calming people's hearts, saying that German Chancellor Hitler wants to express his opinion on the current difficult problems in German foreign policy in clear words when he addresses the parliament on May 17th. He will not only discuss the latest developments in disarmament, but also discuss the entire disarmament conference. The entire event of the international political situation must be clarified at the time when the World Economic Conference is about to open. Only by eliminating the uncertain weather can the disarmament conference have a sign of success. Germany has three major principles, namely: (1) other countries must substantially reduce armaments, (2) Germany's equal demands must be recognized, and (3) world security must be determined. The article strongly opposes the resolution established in Geneva, that is, the political organizations of German armed forces should be regarded as part of the army, because France has no intention of limiting its weapons or abandoning its heavy artillery units. Berlin, 14th, Reuters: The opinion of German political circles is that the success or failure of the Disarmament Conference depends on the speech delivered by Hitler in the parliament next Tuesday. The extent to which the actions in Geneva can be changed. It is heard that Hitler will protest that other countries have not implemented disarmament and will support the so-called "defense groups." If Hitler's debate cannot move Geneva, then the Disarmament Conference can be said to be "dead."</p>
<h3 id="e59">Not Forgetting National Defense in Disarmament; French Armories Busy Manufacturing Arms Day and Night <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 13th, National News: Today, the French Senate</p>
<p>debated the budget bill. When answering questions, Prime Minister Daladier announced that all French armories are currently working under high pressure in order to complete the construction of French eastern defense fortresses as soon as possible. Daladier stated that although France advocates peace and does not reduce armaments, it must also have adequate preparations for national defense to prevent any unexpected events from occurring. The French government is willing to fully supply the army, but will also strive to implement reduction policies to the extent possible. France is a country that loves peace, but its power and just views will never be succumbed to any aspect of oppression. Therefore, a strong military industry and mass production are essential.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Roosevelt Abandons Request to Congress for Authorization to Resolve War Debts <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>World Economic Conference Unaffected; US Maintains Independent Action on Disarmament</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (National Telegram) – US government officials announced to Congress today that President Roosevelt has abandoned his intention to ask Congress for authorization to modify war debts or reach a compromise. Therefore, the US government has directly submitted to Congress for resolution a matter that would have facilitated US progress at the World Economic Conference. Some members of Congress may attend the London Conference. British and American officials generally believe that for the London Conference to be completely successful, an understanding regarding war debts must be reached. However, unless the US Congress itself proposes a solution, it may not be possible to thoroughly discuss it during the Economic Conference. As it stands, the US representatives will likely be unable to propose a solution themselves, and can only quietly listen to proposals from other countries.</p>
<p>The US government's notification to Congress today comes after the US Secretary of State was compelled to inform French Ambassador Lépinay that President Roosevelt felt unable to assume any responsibility for war debts. It is reported that France had proposed to pay the overdue installment from December, but only on the condition that the US declare a moratorium on the installment due in June. The US Secretary of State then informed him that the President had no authority to assume any responsibility, as the President had clearly asked Congress to formally express its opinion on modifying or suspending war debts, but it had not yet done so. The faction in Congress that strongly opposes modification has expressed its views, but the matter has not yet been brought to the floor. The US government knows that if its representatives attending the London Conference do not have the authority to discuss war debts on a broad basis, they will be in a difficult position. However, if President Roosevelt were to ask Congress for the authority to resolve war debts and fail, it would be even more difficult. Therefore, it is better not to ask Congress for authorization.</p>
<p>It is believed that this attitude of the US Congress will not cause the London Conference to fail. US Secretary of State Hull stated today that the main goal of the London Conference is expected to be achieved within two months. Once major issues at the conference are resolved, he believes that exchange rates will stabilize immediately, trade barriers will be reduced significantly, and international relations will improve markedly. However, Hull also hopes that the disarmament deadlock can be resolved before the London Conference opens, as achieving full agreement on economic matters requires first eliminating international suspicions.</p>
<p>At that time, someone asked Hull whether the US would join in sanctions under the Treaty of Versailles if Germany insisted on immediate and complete equality in armaments, leading the Allied powers to invoke the Treaty of Versailles. Hull replied that the US was not a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, and therefore the US did not need to act according to its provisions. Today, other US government officials commented on the disarmament conference deadlock, saying that the US would not participate in the disputes between the Allied powers and Germany, but firmly opposed Germany's large-scale rearmament. If Germany were allowed to rearm at a time when all countries are focusing on reducing armaments, leading to an increasingly tense international situation, it would not be wise. These two statements show that the US will continue to act independently on disarmament, but its actions may be broadly similar to those of the Allied powers.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Herriot's Account of US Visit <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 13th (Reuters) – French representative Édouard Herriot, who had previously remained silent about the results of his visit to the US, made a statement in the financial news today. According to Herriot, US President Roosevelt could deal generously with the war debt issue to the extent of his power. France must repay the debt installment due on December 15 of last year, but this payment can be included in future solutions. The US President will send observers to an international conference, and if this conference can achieve a satisfactory definition of "aggression," then the US President is willing to abandon mutual trade with the aggressor. The US President does not want to express his opinions lightly on treaty revisions, but on the issue of a tariff truce, the US President advocates a truce from April 29 to June 12. However, if the US dollar depreciates, France can adopt exchange surtaxes. He has pointed out to the US President that Germany will soon demand a navy, putting the London and Washington agreement in an awkward situation. He also explained to the US President that the French army and the British navy together form a bulwark for the guarantee of peace and freedom. Herriot had a striking sentence in his article: "I never expected that Germany's demands and Japan's recent declaration would prove my words to be true."</p>

<p>London, 14th (Havas) – Alfred Rosenberg, a confidant of German Chancellor Hitler, left London at 10:00 this morning and hastily returned to Germany. After Rosenberg arrived at the station, before the train departed, there was a disturbance in the station. Some demonstrators shouted "Down with Hitler!" and one person was arrested.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Havas) – Nazi Party member Bohle is currently in Sweden on a mission similar to that of Hitler's confidant Rosenberg in London: to try to make the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula sympathetic to the "Third Reich." However, Swedish people are very cold towards Bohle. The reason is that when Swedish King Gustaf traveled through Germany, he played tennis with Paulín, a first-rate German Jewish tennis player. Bohle then went to see the Swedish minister and told him that the King should not play tennis with Jews. The minister reprimanded him, saying that the King has the freedom to act as he pleases and does not need Bohle's admonishment. The Swedish people have not forgotten this matter, so they do not welcome Bohle.</p>

<p>Danzig, 13th (Reuters) – The "anti-Hitler" strike movement, which was sparked by the Nazi Party's seizure of trade union headquarters, has now failed. From the beginning, there were only partial strikes, with only three steamships and a small number of factories ceasing operations. Newspapers were not affected. The whole city is now completely calm. According to the Nazi Party, they occupied the trade union headquarters in a legal manner because the union was formed from the German General Trade Union, which is now completely "Hitlerized." Although the headquarters was occupied by the police and the Sturmabteilung, there was no disturbance. It is reported that League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig Rosting declared that he could not find anything illegal or unconstitutional in the trade union headquarters incident.</p>

<p>Vienna, 14th (Havas) – On the historical anniversary of the defeat of the Turkish army, the patriotic alliance held a grand demonstration to express Austria's will to maintain independence. Participating in the demonstration were 40,000 members of the patriotic alliance in uniform and a large crowd. The demonstration was held in the Hofburg Palace, where a historical painting depicting the people of Vienna repelling the Turkish army was secretly housed, which further increased the solemnity of the ceremony. Austria recently expressed its dissatisfaction with the leaders of the German Nazi Party. Now, holding this demonstration has special political significance.</p>

<p>Asunción, Paraguay, 13th (National Telegram) – The first goal of Paraguay's declaration of war has been fully achieved. Argentina, Peru, and Chile have all formally notified the Paraguayan government that they have declared neutrality. It is expected that Brazil will also declare neutrality within days. It is also heard that these four countries will begin to pressure Bolivia to submit the Chaco border dispute to arbitration. Although the Paraguayan-Bolivian war has been going on for almost a year, in the past two months, the focus of the dispute between the two sides has been on the method of achieving peace. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile had proposed a basis for resolution, and Peru soon joined. However, Bolivia attempted to have a peace plan proposed by the neutral countries committee in Washington, and was even willing to have the case judged by the US Supreme Court. However, Paraguay became indignant upon hearing of the proposal to move the case to a solution outside of South America, and the peace movement failed. Subsequently, Paraguay, because neighboring countries often sold weapons to Bolivia, resolutely declared war. Today, it has achieved its goal. All neighboring countries have guaranteed that they will no longer sell arms to Bolivia. It is expected that Bolivia, now forced to purchase arms completely from overseas, will accept the mediation of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, first ceasing hostilities and then beginning peace negotiations. (It is noted that Bolivia is greatly influenced by US capital, while Paraguay has mostly British investment, so the two countries have different diplomatic affinities, and there is the aforementioned dispute over the method of peace.)</p>

<p>Tokyo, 14th (China United Press) – Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai. Rumors are rampant in the city that right-wing groups will carry out riots in retaliation. The Metropolitan Police Department has issued a general mobilization order from midnight tonight until tomorrow night, implementing special alert. So-called right-wing groups and their leaders are under police surveillance. The residences of ministers, senior palace officials, and major financial conglomerates, major banks, and power plants are all guarded by police. However, the key leaders of the various financial conglomerates are still very alarmed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Dentsu) – The draft statement on the May 15th Incident has been handed over by the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of the Navy. The two authorities are submitting written opinions to correct the contradictions. The nature of this announcement is that it has not been confirmed by the judgment of the court or the military court, so it only explains the facts and does not make any determination of responsibility, and adopts a policy of avoiding the actual situation. The draft can be completed in general on the 14th. On the 15th, a three-ministry coordination meeting will be held, and after the final approval of the regular cabinet meeting on the 16th, it can be announced.</p>

<p>East London (Reuters) – Fishermen between East London and Durban, Africa, caught three blood-red fish in their nets. They are about a foot long and their color is like the red light of an alarm. They are now stored in the East London Aquatic Animal Institute. The fish's eyes glow and they are very beautiful and rare specimens. Their name is still unknown. The fish are accustomed to living in the high-pressure deep sea, and it is feared that they will not last long in shallow pools.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Chief of Staff Yu of Luandong Discusses the Battle Situation; Special Correspondent Geng Ya of This Newspaper <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Luan County Special Letter. The reporter went to the Qianmen Railway Station on the morning of the 9th, passing through Dongjiaominxiang. The flowers and trees on the roadside were lush and shaded the sun, and the smooth and flat asphalt road was unmatched by the national highway, which was only an inch of land. However, the magnificent palace-style buildings, with their copper-nailed vermilion doors, mostly hung signs of consulates of various countries, and there were blue-eyed, high-nosed guards carrying guns, walking back and forth with composure. As for the so-called "Consulate of the Great Japanese Empire," the Japanese soldiers with red hats, yellow uniforms, and gold trim leaned against the stone lions, held short guns across their chests, and glared at passersby, frequently blowing their short beards under their noses. The Western-style Grand Hotel, which tolerates dirt and filth, is also closely connected to the eye. Zhang Jingyao, the great traitor, was assassinated here the other day by patriotic youths, which shows that traitors, though sheltered in the concessions, will eventually meet on a narrow road and be unable to escape.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the station, I waited for the joint train from Pingkai to Tangshan at 2:00 PM. Along the way, the wheat seedlings were oily green, the rape flowers were golden yellow, and willow catkins fluttered into the window, dancing like snowflakes. The beauty of nature was truly overwhelming. The half-opened peonies and peonies sold at Fengtai Station could be purchased for two dimes per large bunch of twenty flowers. The fate of the king of flowers, whether precious or cheap, is still in the hands of the flower grower. Thirty or so iron cars were parked at Luobao Station, fully loaded with carts and mules. The villagers who were helping to pull the carts and horses looked at each other across the cars, still smiling foolishly, as if they did not yet know that they would suffer danger in the battle. Passing Douzhangzhuang, most of the farmers who were cultivating the fields were pulling the plough with three people in front with ropes and one person holding the plough in the back. It is not known whether they are unable to raise cattle and horses, or whether the cattle and horses have already served on the front lines. There are countless graves near the stations of Tianjin and Tanggu. Those whose descendants are prosperous have built mounds and hills, occupying a lot of land. If they are not improved, after a few years, the farmland will inevitably be gradually encroached upon by endlessly spreading cemeteries. At the same time, as the population increases, it is doubtful that they will not gradually feel the panic of cultivated land.</p>
<p>When checking tickets on the train, all those who saw military caps and belts were treated equally and were not questioned. Military personnel should purchase half-price tickets according to regulations. Nowadays, when the country is in serious difficulty, there is much to rely on the military, so special preferential treatment is given, which is not without reason. In Tanggu, tall and unparalleled foreign houses are interspersed with flat-headed earthen houses. The number of smoke stacks and Mobil oil storage tanks is also considerable, which shows the development of industry and the deep penetration of foreign capitalist forces. The cries of Yangcun cakes, Tianjin sweet pears, Tanggu prawns, roasted chickens, salted duck eggs, etc., were noisy at each station. However, the passengers seemed to have iron stomachs and were not hungry, and there was no fresh transaction. The train's stopping and starting made countless hawkers come full of hope and leave greatly disappointed. This phenomenon is thought to be due to the fact that the eastbound train only carries a small number of soldiers. If the westbound train is full of refugees, the hawkers' business may not be so deserted.</p>
<p>Dozens of miles out of Tanggu, there is no green grass or few trees. Only the windmills that draw seawater to boil salt are spinning endlessly. At that time, the moon rose in the east sea, and it was reflecting the setting sun in the west mountains. The clear air near the sea made the bright moon appear even more clean. The train arrived in Tangshan and did not go any further. Waiting until 4:00 this morning, I changed to another train. Facing the rising red sun, I sped forward and arrived at Leizhuang, where a lot of flour and straw were piled up. The accompanying stretcher bearers, about twenty or so, got off the train here. It is expected that there must be wounded soldiers here. From here, the stations directly to Luan County are mostly dug with military deep trenches and solid protective works. The train stopped at Luan Station (the train only passes here). Walking five miles west, I entered Luan City. On the way, I saw a military horse stable with a couplet on the door on the right that read, "At the juncture of man and beast, we should strive for self-preservation." The meaning is quite alert. When I visited the headquarters of the 57th Army, Army Commander He Zhuguo happened to be in Ping. Chief of Staff Yu Jianzhang received me and informed me of the battle situation as follows:</p>
<p>"The enemy, under the pretext that our army challenged them, making them tired of running, began a general offensive on the 7th night. The northeast of Luanhe was originally stationed by a certain unit of our cavalry division, which was separated by a river from the enemy army in the east of the river, about seven or eight miles away, and confronted each other. On the 7th night, around 9 or 10 o'clock, the enemy unit used armored vehicles and artillery to cover 400 or 500 infantry and cavalry soldiers, and attacked the left and rear of our army in Beidaihe. At the same time, 20 armored vehicles, more than 200 cavalry soldiers, and more than 100 puppet troops protruded from Damituan Taoyuan to attack our garrison battalion. By the morning of the 8th, the enemy armored vehicles rushed to the garrison battalion station, cutting off the communication between Beijiehe and the garrison battalion. Our cavalry in Beidaihe was difficult to support, and the garrison battalion was lost. It was once recaptured, but was eventually dispersed by the enemy planes dropping bombs violently in the air. Fortunately, our armored car Henan was very active and covered the retreat to the Zhangjiazhuang station area. The enemy is still pursuing. The Japanese and puppet troops in Jielingkou also attacked our Funing on the morning of the 7th. On the 8th, the enemy dispatched more than 400 infantry soldiers from the Pingyu Avenue, and under the fierce cover of artillery fire, they attacked Funing City together. Our garrison, a certain company of the Weng Division, fought hard for the whole day. Except for the company commander and more than 20 people who jumped over the city wall and broke through, the rest were sacrificed. Qian'an, Shuangwangbao, Lulong, and other places were also successively lost under the fierce attack of smoke and cannon fire. Today, the enemy is still attacking the Wenfeng Pagoda south of Lulong City and the Qinglong River area west of the city along the Pingyu Avenue. The left wing of our army and the right wing of the Wang Army have jointly attacked the enemy, and the enemy has succeeded in the above-mentioned places before using five or six armored vehicles and more than 200 cavalry to attack Changli fiercely along the Beining Line this morning. A small number of enemy teams were also found on the North Mountain of the city. Although there was only one day of fighting, the gains and losses have been several times, and both sides have suffered great sacrifices. Our main force has now withdrawn to Shigezhuang and Anshan, and the precautions are very strict. The enemy has flanked the area and concentrated artillery fire on the station. After several hours of fierce fighting, they are now in a stalemate. On the sea surface of the Luanhekou, it was discovered that there were three white enemy ships and five black enemy ships. The actual actions are not yet clear. However, the terrain between Luanhekou and Leting is extremely important, and elite troops have been sent to guard it. In this general offensive by the enemy, the puppet army is responsible for the front railway line, so as to cleverly avoid the responsibility of destroying traffic. The Japanese army relies on sharp weapons and attacks the flanks and rear. The future situation is very dangerous, but the morale is extremely strong, and everyone is willing to fight to the death in every battle."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Enemy Attempts to Encircle Luanzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Japanese troops Advance on Several Routes; War Situation Tense; He Zhuguo Sits in Luanzhou, Stabilizing Military Morale</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping. The Japanese army's ambition for further advances in North China is becoming increasingly apparent from the battle situations in Luandong and Gubeikou in recent days. According to the war reports received today (13th), the situation on the west bank of the Luan River is tense, and battle clouds are densely packed in the Shixia Town area. Since the Japanese army's general offensive, the military situation has become increasingly serious. Japanese planes have flown to Beiping to scout, and people's hearts are inevitably panicked. "The mountain rain is coming, and the wind is filling the building." Rumors are rising like bow shadows in a cup, and the cowardly are rushing to flee to Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, as if a great disaster is imminent. It is truly pitiful and ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Japanese army drove large numbers of puppet troops to cross the Luan River to attack Leizhuang and Guye. At the same time, the enemy in Lulong and Qian'an also attempted to cross the river, with the intention of encircling Luanzhou and cutting off our retreat. At around 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 12th), more than 1,500 Japanese and puppet troops and a detachment of field artillery suddenly rushed to the west bank of the Luan River in the direction of Lulong, covering their advance with five bomber planes. They once advanced to the vicinity of Shaheyi, which is only ten miles northwest of the Beining Railway. The sounds of guns and cannons were heard quite clearly in the Leizhuang and Guye areas. Our army's Weng Zhaoyuan's unit rushed to the scene with a regiment, and the two sides engaged in close combat for several hours. By evening, the enemy army, suffering heavy casualties, was unable to support and began to retreat slightly. That night, at Gaotaizi, Japanese troops also crossed the river stealthily, numbering about 3,000, and advanced in several routes. One route attacked Leizhuang and Tuozitou, and fought with our defense forces in Changtianzhuang and Dashiling at night. The situation in Luanzhou was quite tight for a time. Another route of Japanese troops passed through the Pingyu Avenue and clashed with us in Cheyuanzhai, which is about forty miles away from Fengrun. The residents of Fengrun were uneasy, and the atmosphere was tense, and there was some confusion. Most of our troops rushed to the scene, surrounded the enemy, and tried their best to resist. The fierce fighting has not stopped until now. The enemy at Wenfeng Pagoda continued to shell the western side of the river at Shitikai and Tiankai this morning, and the rumbling did not stop until noon. There was no change in the front line.</p>
<p>He Zhuguo is now personally supervising the battle at the front, sitting in Luanzhou. He believes that the enemy forces that are copying to various places west of Luan are not difficult to solve, and military morale is stable. The war on the front of the railway is relatively calm. Our armored vehicles are still patrolling back and forth near Shimen and the Luan River Bridge. After our army changed its defenses at Gubeikou, it engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in Xiaoxinkailingxia and other places. Our side calmly responded to the enemy, advancing and retreating repeatedly. After fierce fighting all day and night yesterday, the Japanese army attacked us with more than ten tanks again this morning, and the stalemate continued until noon.</p>
<p>The situation in Shixia Town is quite urgent. Japanese planes are bombing everywhere, and countless civilians are killed and injured, which is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>European War Crisis (Roman Correspondence)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Inside Story of the MacDonald-Mussolini Meeting According to British Media <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>France Expresses Displeasure Over British Prime Minister's Visit to Italy</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power, the political situation in Europe has undergone unusual changes. Nationalism, from brewing to being openly advocated, seems to be pulling the current era back to the 18th century in the course of history. In the foreign policies of various countries, there is almost a tit-for-tat situation, resembling the pre-war situation. Among them, the deteriorating relationship between Germany and France is the most profound manifestation. Moreover, as Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, the authority of justice (due to the inability to sanction atrocities) has diminished, and the control of force has become even stronger. As a result, the clouds of war have spread throughout Europe, and the military crisis between Germany and France is the fuse for the future. Italy's understanding with Germany and Hitler's German spirit would indeed be united in opposing France due to shared interests. However, how many contradictions do Germany and Italy themselves have that are difficult to overcome? Therefore, the situation in Europe is very unstable, and its reflection on the economy is naturally very serious. Unemployed workers have no work, and general consumption power is reduced. (Taking Italy as an example, the number of unemployed people is already over one million.) Tariffs, currencies, etc., are not easy to resolve appropriately. In addition, the financial panic in the United States has also greatly shocked Europe. Therefore, British Prime Minister MacDonald's visit to Rome to meet with the Blackshirt Prime Minister has attracted worldwide attention and is also a major change in European politics.</p>
<p>Looking at past history, Britain, occupying the throne of world finance, indeed has the mentality of "the sun never sets" in its self-esteem and arrogance. However, it could have telegraphed the Blackshirt Prime Minister to ask him to come to London for a meeting. Why did he personally travel to Rome? Little did he know that Britain was shouldering "the banner of world peace, and also for Britain's security. Therefore, Mr. MacDonald rose up, regardless of his graying hair, and dedicated himself to harmonizing the chaos in Europe..." Since the British Prime Minister took the trouble to accommodate, the Italians naturally expressed their welcome. The bold words, "Only the two of us bear the responsibility of maintaining world peace," and "Almost half of the world is unified under Mussoliniism," fully demonstrated the enthusiasm of the Italians and revealed some of their delusions. In reality, the detailed content of the meeting and talks between the two prime ministers is still a closely guarded secret. However, their central issue of discussion must be the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, which is mostly questionable.</p>
<p>Since Hitler formed his cabinet, the movement for Germany to regain its lost territories after the war has gradually become more intense and concrete. Moreover, Italy gained very limited benefits when the Treaty of Versailles was concluded. Therefore, Mussolini, who loves grandeur and success, has long held grievances. Thus, he joined hands with Hitler, who was in distress. Following Germany are countries such as Austria and Hungary. On the other hand, France is the leader, and attached to it are Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, etc. These two groups are in mutual opposition, breeding the crisis of a second world war. The British Prime Minister, seeing this danger and wanting to seek peaceful means to escape the crisis, knows that the only way to do so is to satisfy the "aggrieved" with some benefits. This is a very clear fact. Indeed, the London Evening Standard published the inside story of the MacDonald-Mussolini meeting. The contents of the amendments they proposed to the "Treaty of Versailles" are roughly as follows: (1) Cut a piece of land in the Polish Corridor, cutting across from the West Polish city of Konik (CBOJNICE) to the East Prussian city of Marienwerder, as the German Corridor and have Germany lay railway tracks.</p>
<p>(2) Romania should cede Transylvania and Banat, previously taken from Hungary, to Hungary.</p>
<p>(3) Yugoslavia should also return the Banat region, formerly occupied by Hungary, between the Danube and Tisza River (TBEISS RIVER), at the confluence of the two rivers, to Hungary.</p>
<p>(4) Yugoslavia should return the old Austrian region of Krainburg to Austria.</p>
<p>(5) The ancient state of Croatia (CROATIA), currently annexed by Yugoslavia, should be allowed to be independent.</p>
<p>(6) The southern coast of Dalmatia (DAIMATIA), such as Herzegovina (HERZEGOVINA) and Montenegro (MONTENEGRO), must be separated from Yugoslavia and merged into Albania (ALBANIA), and placed under Italian protection as a buffer state.</p>
<p>If this proposal is realized, then the German President and Marshal Hindenburg can return to his hometown of East Prussia without suffering the humiliation of crossing the borders of other countries, only through the German corridor. Italy, which has long coveted hegemony in North Africa and control of the Dalmatian coast, can take control from the north. However, what about Yugoslavia? Moreover, in the international balance of power, Italy's power has increased, and France will inevitably be reduced. Since the British Prime Minister first went to Italy, France naturally expressed displeasure. Therefore, France expressed dissatisfaction with the Four-Power Conference, believing that it was the great-powerism of the pre-war era, and that the League of Nations should now be at the center and adopt enlightened international democracy. Even if it is based on great powers, Poland, which is enough to match Italy, should be invited. At the same time, Poland is unwilling to rely on France, so Polish Foreign Minister Beck visited Czech Foreign Minister on April 1, and then went to Prague, Yugoslavia, to secretly discuss with its foreign minister. This is the beginning of the Small Entente's opposition to great powers. Moreover, it is widely rumored that a secret agreement will be established between the Soviet Union and Poland, so the disputes on the European continent are still just beginning. Even if Germany praises Britain as the "savior of the white race," and the British Prime Minister goes to Rome for peaceful purposes, if the above proposal is indeed implemented, I am afraid it will further arouse the struggle of European countries and increase the anxiety of the people.

<h3 id="e72">Panic in People's Hearts in Beiping and Tianjin Enemy Planes Fly Over Beiping Wealthy People Flee One After Another Japanese Aircraft Carrier Discovered at Dagu Port <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Enemy planes have been disturbing Beiping for two days, and the citizens feel deeply uneasy. Although the enemy planes did not come on the 13th due to rain, an aircraft carrier was discovered at Dagu Port on the 12th, carrying thirty to forty planes, which is enough to shake the hearts of the people in Beiping and Tianjin. The actual situation of panic in the hearts of the people in Beiping and Tianjin is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been disturbing the skies of Beiping for two days, and the general public feels deeply uneasy. Those with wealth and property believe that Beiping can no longer be a comfortable place to live, so they are implementing the plan of "the best of the thirty-six stratagems is to leave." On the afternoon of the 12th, the number of first and second class tickets sold for the special express train to Beiping-Pukou was twice as many as usual, with seventy-nine first class tickets and over one hundred and forty second class tickets sold. In addition, there were even more third class tickets sold. Those who took the express train to Tianjin to seek temporary refuge in the concessions were not included. Starting on the morning of the 13th, the ticket offices at Qianmen Railway Station and travel agencies were crowded with people ordering tickets, vying to be first and fearing to be last, rushing to purchase. The reporter set off again in the afternoon to interview the general situation in the city. Standing at Qianmen Station for about a quarter of an hour, I saw many heavy trucks and rickshaws transporting luggage. On the platform of the East Station, there were already over seventy pieces of luggage (suitcases, bedding, net baskets) with route slips attached, waiting for the train. Only dozens of people stayed in the waiting room. According to the ticket seller, forty-five first class tickets and fifty-nine second class tickets have been sold today. This did not include tickets sold by hotels. On the Pinghan Railway side, there was also a lot of luggage piled up on the platform, mostly for those going to Shijiazhuang. Over fifty first and second class tickets have already been sold. The reporter also went to Dongjiaomin Lane to investigate hotels such as "Hotel des Colonies," "Hotel des Andes," "Hotel Adler," "Grand Hotel des Wagons-Lits," and "Astor House." Not many people have moved in recently, but there are many people storing luggage. According to the accountant of the Grand Hotel des Wagons-Lits, due to the recent Zhang Jingyao case, the concession area has strict restrictions on the admission of Chinese people whose origins are unclear, so Chinese people cannot move in at will. There has been no decrease in the number of visitors to various entertainment venues. Businesses are not accepting valuables, but everything else is as usual. Overall, although the atmosphere in the city is tense, the people's hearts have not reached the level of panic as in the Yuguan Incident.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 12th in Tianjin, an enemy aircraft carrier was suddenly discovered near the lighthouse about sixty miles off the coast of Dagu Port, escorted by three battleships, with several American warships following behind. At about 10:00 a.m., the enemy ship advanced to the sea about thirty miles away from Dagu Port. Our coastal defense authorities observed with binoculars and determined that the enemy aircraft carrier was carrying thirty to forty planes. The ship was named "Notoro" with a displacement of 15,000 tons. At 12:00 noon, the ship sailed back to the lighthouse and docked. At 2:00 p.m., six planes from the ship flew over the vicinity of Dagu Port and reconnoitered for half an hour before returning to the ship. Tonight, the enemy ship used searchlights to peer into Dagu Port. Also, at 2:00 p.m. on the 11th, a gray ship suddenly arrived at Dagu, flying the British flag. Upon inspection by the customs, it was found that the ship was full of Japanese people. The customs inspector immediately asked why they were flying the British flag, but the Japanese did not answer. The customs inspector boarded the ship for inspection and learned that the ship was named "Shin-Kyu." There were no munitions on board. When asked if they were entering the port, they replied that they were, and immediately changed to the Japanese flag. After entering the port, the ship docked at the Dalian Wharf in Tanggu. According to official reconnaissance, the ship was measuring the depth of the sea for the enemy aircraft carrier and checking for reefs to facilitate the enemy ship's sailing. After receiving this news, residents of Tianjin either fled to the British and French concessions or went south en masse. (13th)</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence: The population of the Hunan Provincial Capital is estimated to be over 300,000. He Jian has decided to establish a regular city and establish the Changsha Municipal Government. It has been discussed several times in the provincial affairs meetings. Various parties do not oppose the establishment of the city, but due to financial difficulties and the depletion of the people's resources, most advocate that the principle of not increasing the people's burden and not exceeding the original budget of the current Municipal Affairs Office should be followed. Therefore, Cao Bokai, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, drafted the "Outline of the Hunan Provincial Capital City Establishment Plan" and submitted it to Chairman He of the Provincial Government. He convened one section chief from each of the four departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education to hold a joint meeting to discuss and decide on eight city establishment plans, which were announced and implemented immediately. The date for the establishment of the Changsha Municipal Government has been agreed upon as July 1. The city establishment plan is as follows: (1)</p>

The west bank starts from Liao Jiayuanzi, goes west, through Guangdong Mountain, Zhangjiaba, to Tuba, then goes north to Zhangjiachong, Caojiatang, Jianfeng Mountain, Xiao Chong Yuanzi, to Heyetang, then turns east again, through Yejipo, out of Zhifang Textile Factory, to Datongling. All around are bounded by fortresses.

Matters under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau shall still be managed by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. (7) The Changsha County Government shall not be relocated temporarily until the new governance has been selected and equipped.

<h3 id="e74">Xu He Kong Remnant Bandits Roam the Border Between Hunan and Hubei Provinces Repeatedly Suppressed and Heavily Damaged <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The border areas of provinces such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi are places where bandits and communists are active. The major forces include Xu Xiangqian, He Long, and Kong Hechong. Xu's bandits recently occupied the border areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi, He's bandits occupied the border areas of Hunan and Hubei, and Kong's bandits occupied the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, forming a tripod situation. However, they have been repeatedly suppressed by government troops and suffered heavy damage, with great losses in strength. The recent disturbances of the three groups of bandits and the government troops' preparations for suppression are described as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Xiangqian's Bandits: Xu's bandits previously infiltrated northern Sichuan with elite troops. The Sichuan army, led by Tian Songyao, together with Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and other units, made every effort to block and suppress them. The bandits' base areas of Bazhong, Nanjiang, and Tongjiang were successively recovered. The bandits, knowing that they could not penetrate further, retreated to the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi. Those in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, originally Xu's old troops, are currently rampant, such as Guangshan, Jingfu, Shangcheng, and Huangchuan in Henan, and Macheng and Huang'an in Hubei, causing widespread disturbances. The burning and killing in Hejia, Wenshu Temple, Xiangdian, Futianhe, and other places were extremely tragic. It is recently rumored that Xu has sent Ji Xun to command via a roundabout route. Xu is also attempting to enter Hubei from the Shaanxi border and join forces with them. As for the bandits' strength, there are the 4th, 9th, and 26th Armies in the border areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi, and the 24th, 25th, and 28th Armies in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. It is recently heard that they have been reorganized. In addition to the Sichuan and Shaanxi armies preparing to attack Xu's main force from both sides, Liu Zhenhua is leading ten divisions to suppress the bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, with four divisions responsible for pursuit and six divisions responsible for interception. Liu went to Jiangxi from Hankou on the 11th, personally carrying the bandit suppression plan for the border areas of the three provinces to Chiang for approval and instructions. He will return to his defense post within a few days and order mobilization for suppression.</p>
<p>He Long's Bandits: He's bandits have been entrenched in Shhehe's old nest and the area bordering western Hunan for several months. He claims to be the commander-in-chief and army commander, and is based in Wuyaguan. Duan Dechang and Wang Bingnan serve as puppet division commanders, stationed in various places. Initially, the bandits tried hard to invade Hunan, but after the failure in Yongshun, they did not dare to cross the thunder pool again. Recently, being trapped on the periphery, they thought of finding another way out, so they sent a bandit regiment to infiltrate Honghu. Xu Yuanquan telegraphed and sent the 34th Division Zhang Wanxin's troops to suppress them, and they were quickly defeated. He's bandits were unsuccessful in their plan, but their ambition was not quelled. They sent another unit to continue to invade Honghu, in an attempt to open the route from western Hubei to central Hubei. Zhang's troops are still in the process of suppressing them, and Commander-in-Chief Xu Yuanquan has dispatched boats to facilitate their infiltration. Xu is scheduled to take a plane to Sha within days and then go to the front to supervise the suppression.</p>
<p>Kong Hechong's Bandits: Kong's bandits, originally called the 16th Army, have been disturbing the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for a long time. Recently, they have been reorganized into the 16th, 17th, and 18th Armies, with Kong serving as the commander-in-chief. They have been rampaging through Tongshan and Xianning in southern Hubei, Xiutong and Lianping in northwestern Jiangxi, and Ping and Liu in eastern Hunan. He Jian, Chairman of Hunan, was first appointed by Chiang as the Bandit Suppression Supervisor of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border, and then as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route of the Five Provinces Bandit Suppression, and the bandits were within his suppression range. After taking office, He immediately led his troops to successively occupy the bandit nests of Kong in Yongxian and Li Tianzhu in Ninggang. The general headquarters will be established in Changsha within days and then moved to Yuanzhou, and an order will be issued for general suppression. On the 12th, He telegraphed Hankou to report on the suppression of Kong's bandits and Li's bandits, saying, "Since our troops were ordered to suppress the red bandits in western Jiangxi, they have fled in all directions. The puppet 8th Army and 12th Division under Li Bandit Tianzhu, and more than 20,000 bandits with guns in Lianyong, with five or six thousand guns, were attacked by our Wang Dongyuan Division in Ninggang Yongxian and gathered in Wanlian on Weiyu and other days this month. After a fierce attack by our Chen Guangzhong Division, more than 3,000 people were killed on the spot. They are still stubbornly resisting, and Wang Dongyuan Division has been transferred from Ninggang to Lian to launch a pincer attack. The bandits' spirit has been frustrated. The entire 16th, 17th, and 18th Armies of Kong's bandits were attacked by our Peng Weiren Division in the vicinity of Wan Xiaoyuan last month, and more than 3,000 bandits were killed. After being intercepted by our Tao and Guang divisions, they have now been broken up into smaller units. A unit attempted to flee north to Tongcheng from the border between Ping and Liu, and was repeatedly blocked and heavily damaged by our Li Jue Division and the local troops. They are now being vigorously suppressed. Liuping Yueyang is quiet as usual, and the traffic between Xian and Pu is still safe." (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Recovered Yutian, Killed Many Bandits Remnant Bandits Have Retreated to Jiangxi Border <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The recent military bandit suppression in Fujian Province is divided into three aspects: one is Changting in western Fujian, one is Chong'an in northern Fujian, and one is Jianning in the center of the border between western and northern Fujian. Regarding the Changting area, after Deng Shizeng, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Office, went to Longyan from Zhangzhou to act as the Left Route Commander-in-Chief, he ordered Shen Guanghan's division to station in Dachi and Xiaochi in Yanbian to suppress guerrilla bandits. According to reports, more than 4,000 red bandits from the pseudo 19th Army, with more than 3,000 guns, invaded Yangdong and Gaowu on the border between Changting and Liancheng. Liu Zhanxiong's brigade was specially dispatched to suppress them. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the artillery fire was extremely intense, and the bandits were unable to withstand it and retreated into Ting territory. In this campaign, more than 300 bandits were killed, more than 200 guns were seized, and more than 100 people were captured. Commander Shen has now moved his headquarters to Miaoqian to facilitate the advance of troops in the vicinity. In the Chong'an area, after Liu Heding's division and Liu Shangzhi's brigade were suppressed from Jianyang, they have successively recovered Shixing Village and Shangmei. A remnant of the bandits retreated to Xingdian, and two regiments, Li Huan and Nie Jinlong, tracked and pursued them. The two sides contacted in Xingdian on the 4th. After two days of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand it and fled over the mountain, retreating into Chongcheng. Our army recovered Xingdian on the 6th. There are still more than 3,000 bandits defending Chongcheng. Li and Nie's regiments have requested Brigade Commander Liu to send additional troops to assist in the attack. Xingdian has been captured by bandits seven times, and the local area is severely damaged. County Magistrate Zhu Wenwei has temporarily set up a county office in Jiangkou for office work in order to advance with the army. The bandits in Jianning, Qingliu, and Ninghua have all been repelled by Lu Xingbang's division, and many bandits have been killed. The remnant troops have retreated to the Jiangxi border. Lu's division is still sending teams to pursue them separately. (May 8)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Economic Decline and Industry Depression in Jiangxi Province, Only the Banking Industry is Thriving <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication, Jiangxi has been plagued by bandits for years, spreading to eighty-one counties, production has ceased, exports are nonexistent, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. In the past, various products such as porcelain, summer cloth, bamboo cloth, paper, tea, and rice had annual export values of several million or even ten million yuan. Since 1927, exports have plummeted. Jiangxi used to be a surplus province, but last year it had a deficit of 600,000 yuan. Stores are deserted, and the countryside is mostly bankrupt. However, amidst this industrial depression, the banking industry alone is thriving. In addition to the branches of China, Central, Shanghai, and Guohuo banks in the province, there are also several banks such as Construction, Yumin, and Municipal. When closing the accounts last year, China and Central each had a surplus of more than 200,000 yuan, Shanghai had more than 100,000 yuan, and even the least profitable Municipal Bank reached 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The excellence of its business can be imagined. This is indeed an abnormal economic development. The reasons are: (1) Middle-class people from other counties cannot settle down due to banditry, and most of them pack up their belongings and move to the provincial capital, depositing their money in banks at low interest rates. (2) Amidst this wave of rural bankruptcies, there is a tendency for economic power to concentrate in cities. (3) This province used to be a surplus province. Merchants from Shanghai and other foreign ports often used the selling price of various specialties to offset purchases, without having to directly remit cash from the province. Currently, the financial situation is stagnant, and the balance is lost. When purchasing goods in foreign ports, cash must be remitted from the province, and large banks have the opportunity to manipulate this. (4) Because the exchange rate and the ticket price from Shanghai to Hankou have increased, many businesses purchase Shanghai banknotes from Central and China banks to purchase goods. The banknote is higher than cash. At the highest time, each 1,000 yuan banknote required a discount of more than 30 yuan. (5) Small and medium-sized merchants often borrow money from banks due to poor business and tight turnover. The interest rate is higher than the bank's deposit interest rate. Due to these various reasons, the banking industry alone can profit. (May 5th)</p>
<p>Jiang Song Amateur Sports Meet Day 2</p>

<p>Hui Nan Security Team Destroys Bandit Den</p>
<p>Zhang, the head of the eighth district of the county's security team, learned that Lu Yunnan, the son of Lu Yinzhang, the head of Xiangli Township in the sixth district of Fengxian, had been kidnapped and the ransom notes were hidden in the Chu Xie family's house in the district. He led many armed team members to search Chu's house secretly the night before. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already escaped, and only a bandit woman, Chu Zhang, was captured. According to her confession, the kidnapped person was hidden in a wheat field near Sanzao Town. They immediately went to rescue the kidnapped Lu Yunnan and sent him to the county for disposal.</p>
<p>Taicang Domestically Produced Goods Exhibition Discovers Japanese Goods The Shanghai Domestically Produced Goods Touring Group came to Taicang on the 5th of this month and jointly held a Domestically Produced Goods Exhibition with the county party headquarters and the First People's Education Center in the Sanyiguo Shame Museum in the city starting on the 6th. Under the name of the Domestically Produced Goods Exhibition, it was actually a temporary marketplace. At about 9 a.m. on the 8th, Lu Zuoheng and Zhang Menghua and other citizens of the city went to visit. They suddenly saw printed muslin cloth and twill flannel cloth and other goods displayed there, and were suspicious. It was difficult to determine whether they were domestically produced goods. Lu and others were moved by patriotic enthusiasm, and immediately prepared to buy a few feet to study and carefully examine the materials, which seemed suspicious. Because the matter concerned the promotion of domestically produced goods, they immediately prepared the procedures and asked the county party headquarters for investigation. After learning the situation, the county party headquarters immediately held a committee meeting and recommended Committee Member Yuan Kejian to send the cloth samples to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters with official documents to ask the Enemy Goods Inspection Committee for identification. As a result, one section was indeed Japanese goods, and a certificate was immediately issued to confirm it. Now, Committee Member Yuan returned to Taicang on the afternoon of the 13th to report the process of going to Shanghai to all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Cracking Down on Red Pill Trafficking Organizations</p>
<p>The popularity of red pills is increasing in Jiaxing. The County Public Security Bureau is paying close attention to this and has ordered the police to investigate and crack down on them. In the past four or five days, several cases of red pill trafficking organizations have been cracked. Yesterday, the red pill trafficking organization of Lu Guibiao's family at No. 5 Fanhu Lake was cracked and many certificates were seized. The suspects were immediately sent to the court for interrogation, and Lu's residence was sealed.</p>
<p>Jiading Prohibition of Lantern Parades Leads to a Market Strike The lantern parades in various townships of the county have been repeatedly prohibited without success, and well-intentioned people in the city also initiated performances on the evening of the 12th. The next morning, the Anfen Bureau detained Chen Xingquan and two other leaders. In the evening, many people still gathered at the City God Temple with lanterns to continue the performances. Liu Rongxiang, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and Gao Baozhen, the captain of the police team, went to persuade them, but to no avail. They set off on a parade to Guanjiaqiao, where they were stopped by the police team, who tore up the lanterns, seized the gongs and drums, and detained two people. The crowd followed to the county office. The police team prevented them from entering and confronted them at the gate. Captain Gao then climbed up and persuaded them to disperse and promised to release the detained people and return the gongs and drums. Unexpectedly, the crowd not only did not disperse but rushed forward and pushed Gao down. The police team also fought back. For a while, the order was chaotic. The police team fired a shot into the sky, and the crowd dispersed. As a result, more than a dozen public security bureau policemen including Cheng Changqing and Qin Wenli, and police team members Chen Debiao, Chen Zhaozhong, Lu Yongxi, and Zhu Hongsheng were injured. More than ten rioters and spectators were also injured. On the morning of the 14th, nine out of ten stores in the city went on strike. The county government convened an emergency meeting of the county chamber of commerce, various trade associations, and other organizations and groups, and decided to recommend Huang Shizuo, the head of the first district, to represent County Chief Xu, together with Tang Yiyu, a member of the standing committee of the county party headquarters, and Chen Peiqing, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, to persuade the merchants to open the market and release all the detained people. A disturbance finally subsided. Wuxi Teasing a Girl Leads to Murder</p>
<p>A Rong, the second daughter of Wang Erquan, a resident of Tianduoli Township, Northwest Tangtian, Fifth District (Tianshang City), is 14 years old and is simply dressed. She is engaged to the son of Liu Moubao nearby but has not yet married. You Xiajinjin, a villager, is about 30 years old and fond of women. Seeing A Rong's charming appearance, he followed her when she went out and teased her in every possible way. A Rong, who was humiliated for no reason, scolded You Xiajinjin severely. You Xiajin, ashamed and angry, kicked A Rong twice, hitting a vital part, and she died immediately. Seeing that he had caused trouble, A Jin asked Zhang Rongbao, the head of the village, to bribe the victim's family with 80 yuan to make peace. The head of the district, Tu Keqiang, has sent people to investigate the truth because the case involves human life, so as to report to the county for investigation.</p>

At 9:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month, he went to the small river behind the village with a small fishing net to catch fish, and caught a large shrimp, about two inches long. Zhou Sanguan found the shrimp plump and lovely, so he put it in his mouth. Unexpectedly, the shrimp's large foot clamped his upper lip, causing him pain in his heart and lungs. Zhou Sanguan was extremely angry and removed the shrimp shell and swallowed the shrimp meat. But he was unable to speak. When he returned home for lunch, his upper lip suddenly swelled up and he felt unbearable pain. Because he was unable to seek medical treatment, he died last night.</p>

<p>Yangzhou Canal Water Rises Sharply, Canal Banks in Danger</p>
<p>The water level in the Grand Canal in Jiangbei has risen sharply recently without receding. The water level gauge at the Sanyugou Sluice in Jiangdu reached one foot and one foot and four inches yesterday, which is more than one foot and four inches higher than the highest water level last year. It is also reported that the spring repair project of the canal has not been completed due to lack of funds, which is quite worrying. After repeated consultations with the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society by the Canal Engineering Bureau, it was approved to allocate 126,000 yuan for the project. However, the amount is still insufficient. Xu Dingkang, the director of the Canal Engineering Bureau, submitted a revised estimate of this year's spring repair to the province in April of this year, requesting Chairman Gu to allocate funds to start construction. Two months have passed since then, and no order has been received to comply. The water level of the canal is increasing day by day, and the future is worrying. As for the west bank stone work, construction has been underway for nearly two months, and only more than 90,000 yuan of the project funds have been allocated from the county's land donation to the Finance Department. Recently, stone merchants have been demanding payment one after another. Director Xu feels deeply that the economy is not enough, but the important projects cannot be ignored. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to Chairman Gu requesting help.</p>

<p>Liu Wanqi, 29 years old, lives behind Jian Dao Lane, east of Zhunti Temple, Dongguan Street in this city. Liu has been making a living by digging and selling loess for a living. Liu took several people to Huangni Mountain outside Bianyimen this (13th) morning to dig mud. Because the excavated area was too deep, the upper loess suddenly collapsed, burying Liu in the soil in an instant. After being rescued from the soil by the people who went with him, he had already lost his breath and died. It is also tragic.</p>

<p>The third annual meeting of the Chinese Textile Society was held on the 13th in the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce. More than 200 members from Shanghai, Hankou and other ports attended. A welcome meeting was held in Tangzha at noon. At 4:00 p.m., they took a car to the city. When the car passed Tangzha, laid-off workers from the Dasheng Yarn Factory stopped the car to petition, causing a slight disturbance. The military and police dispersed them. The presidium of the conference elected Zhu Xianfang (Shenxin Factory), Zhang Wenqian (Dasheng Factory), Wang Zisu (Hongzhang Factory), and Zhu Yanshuo to speak. The Textile Society was affected by the depression of the yarn factory and held the meeting on Saturday and Sunday ahead of schedule, which made those responsible for the technical department feel greatly. Today, domestic experts are gathered, which can be used to study each other. Subsequently, Huang Jianzhang and others read papers. The conference passed a declaration on reducing the work of yarn factories.</p>

<p>The Li Fort area of this county is recruiting workers to dredge the Chuanzhang River. The Ding Suo Town section has already started construction. Unexpectedly, on the third afternoon of the start of construction, a huge turmoil occurred. At that time, three or five workers were resting because they were hungry. The supervisor (the instructor of the security team in the area) Xiang Bin saw this and whipped them severely with a horse whip, forcing them to work. As a result, hundreds of workers were furious and stopped working together. They rushed to beat Xiang. Seeing that the situation was not good, Xiang fled back to the team headquarters. At that time, thousands of workers, like a tide, went ashore to chase and surround the district team headquarters, cursing loudly, unanimously demanding that Xiang be dismissed immediately. The town chief Qiu reported to the district chief Chen by phone. Chen rushed to the scene after hearing the news. His poor handling of the situation further angered the workers, who picked up bricks and tiles and threw them at Chen. Chen fled with his head in his hands. Later, after Town Chief Qiu persuaded them with kind words and promised to submit a request to dismiss Xiang, the workers calmed down and dispersed.</p>

<p>Baima Lake in Xixiang, Xiaoshan, covers an area of more than ten miles and has always been a place for thousands of farmers in Xixiang to fish. Unexpectedly, recently Dong Xiaohou and other gentry from Nanxiang submitted a request to Zhejiang University to take over the lake as an official property, build dams to raise fish, and prohibit fishermen from fishing, resulting in the severance of the livelihoods of thousands of fishing households. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the provincial and county authorities, striving to recover the inherent people's property. The county government has convened a meeting of residents along the lake to discuss the matter, and a telegram has been sent to the Provincial Department of Construction to request instructions. In addition, more than ten representatives from the fishing households have gone to the province to petition.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement Expires <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Today it expires naturally, and new tariffs will be levied from tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement expires on May 15 (today). Our government authorities have repeatedly stated that the agreement will expire naturally and there is no doubt about it. Now the customs authorities have received an order from the Ministry of Finance to levy new tariffs on Japanese goods starting tomorrow (16). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Agreement From the late Qing Dynasty to the Beiyang government era, China's tariff rights were lost and controlled by foreigners, resulting in low tariff rates on foreign goods, which allowed them to be sold to China as much as possible. The wealth of the Chinese people has been exploited by foreigners for decades, resulting in a weakening of national power and a decline in people's strength. After the National Government established Nanjing, it began negotiations to recover tariff autonomy. All countries had no objection, but Japan insisted on exchange conditions, so the Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement was established, which still allowed Japan to maintain the right to sell Japanese goods at low tariffs. However, the period was set for three years, which will expire on May 15 this year. Our government temporarily signed the agreement because its primary goal was to recover tariff autonomy.</p>
<p>Expiration and Termination The agreement will expire today (May 15). All sectors of the public, groups, and domestic goods and industrial and commercial circles have long telegraphed not to renew the agreement, and our government has also decided to let it expire naturally and no longer negotiate. The Japanese side initially intended to continue negotiations with our country in order to extend the term in order to continue to sell Japanese goods. Japanese merchants and residents in this port held a meeting a month ago to request their government to contact us in an attempt to prolong it. However, because the treaty stated that it was impossible to continue and our country's attitude was extremely firm, they had to let it expire naturally and become invalid. Japanese goods were rushed Japanese people, in view of the fact that our country has no intention of continuing this agreement, have tried their best to rush Japanese goods to China before May 15, to sell them in the market, in order to collect the last gamble. Therefore, the number of Japanese goods transported to China in the past two months is really amazing. The reason is that half of them are for price reduction and dumping due to our resistance, and half of them are because the reciprocity agreement is about to expire, so they have to rush to ship them to China to avoid being levied new tariffs. New tariffs will be levied Since the government decided to let the agreement expire, the Ministry of Finance has instructed the customs and tax authorities to levy import tariffs on Japanese goods according to the new tariff regulations issued on January 1, 1931, starting on May 16 (tomorrow). The new tariffs levied on Japanese goods include cloth, seafood, fish and shellfish, totaling more than forty kinds. It is said that both customs and flood control surcharges will be levied at the same time.</p>

<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Administrative Yuan's Political Consolidation Committee in Ping, has been in Shanghai for days, contacting all parties. Now, because Wang Jingwei, the President of the Administrative Yuan, has repeatedly telegraphed him to go north, Huang took the 11:30 p.m. train to Beijing last night. Those who went to the North Station to see him off included Qian Xinzhi and others from the banking community, Huang Yanpei from the local association, and Huang Boqiao, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, and dozens of others. According to Huang's conversation with this newspaper reporter in the car, Wang Kemin, a member of the Political Consolidation Committee in Ping, has already returned to Ping, and He Qigong is now in Beijing. I will stay in Beijing for about one day, and after meeting President Wang, I will go north with He to take office. When the reporter asked about the defense of Tianjin and other important issues, Huang was unwilling to express anything, only saying that the problem was complicated and could not be explained in a few words. Also, when those who saw him off asked Huang when he would return to Shanghai on this trip, Huang smiled and replied that it would be next spring.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Zhu Shaoliang Talks About Governing Gansu <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Facilitate transportation, improve agriculture, and other things must be determined after taking office. Zhu is scheduled to go west to take office this month.</p>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang, the newly appointed Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, flew from Beijing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is scheduled to go to Gansu to take office this month. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhu at his residence yesterday and asked him about the current situation of Gansu and the policies for governing Gansu. Zhu gave a detailed reply as follows:</p>
<p>Current Situation of Gansu The reporter first asked Chairman Zhu about the current situation of Gansu. Zhu replied that he had not been there before, so he did not know the political and social realities. However, he had met with the former Chairman Shao Lizi in Beijing and learned about the situation there. The land is rich in resources, but most of them have not been developed. The people are mostly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, the annual output of wool and animal skins, in addition to industrial raw materials such as cotton, is also very large. However, due to inconvenient transportation and high freight rates, it is declining day by day. Moreover, this year's drought has caused a disaster and the output of farmland has been sharply reduced, which has also reduced revenue. Therefore, the financial situation is very difficult, but it is still able to balance income and expenditure and maintain the status quo. The transportation in Gansu is very inconvenient. The only trunk road is the automobile road from Xi'an to Lanzhou, which is 1,100 miles long. It was built by the military and only leveled the roadbed. There is no scale of a highway. When Chairman Shao was in power, he planned to build and repave the road surface, which could be completed in about six or seven months.</p>
<p>Developing the Northwest Zhu continued to tell the reporter that the central government now attaches great importance to the development of the Northwest, and the people are also very interested in it. However, to seek development, it is necessary to open up roads and facilitate transportation first. All construction must have new machinery. Without convenient means of transportation, it is impossible to import a large amount of machinery. The central government has sent experts to investigate and plan for the improvement of agriculture. Moreover, several irrigation engines were imported during the drought years ago, but they could not be fully adopted due to financial resources and transportation. To seek the development of agriculture, reclamation and afforestation are also important facilities. The reporter then asked whether Chairman Shao had invited financial giants in Shanghai to discuss investment and development in the Northwest. Will there be further contact? Zhu replied that if transportation in Gansu can be improved, all parties will be happy to go there for development without the need for contact. Therefore, the most important thing for development is transportation.</p>
<p>Policy Guidelines The reporter then asked Zhu to announce his policy guidelines for governing Gansu. Zhu said that he could not talk about the so-called policy guidelines before he arrived in Gansu. The policy guidelines cannot be separated from the society and empty talk. It must be determined according to the situation of the society. I am not very familiar with the situation in Gansu at present, so I have not made any decisions on the policy guidelines. As for the candidates for the heads of various departments of the Gansu Provincial Government, they will remain the same and there will be no changes.</p>
<p>Going to Gansu This Month Zhu came to Shanghai this time to take care of personal matters. It is said that he will return to Beijing within this week for consultations. He will also go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang. He should be able to go to Gansu to take office this month.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Reduce Silk and Tea Freight Rates The Ministry of Communications Orders China Merchants Bureau <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>In order to reduce the freight rates of silk, tea, porcelain, lacquer, and tung oil, the Ministry of Communications yesterday issued an order to the China Merchants Bureau, saying that in order to implement the order, it was found that the Shanghai Local Association requested a reduction in the freight rates of silk, tea, porcelain, lacquer, and tung oil. The bureau previously submitted a reply requesting that silk, tea, and other trade associations sign special transportation contracts. The ministry has forwarded the matter to the Ministry of Industry for investigation. Now, the Ministry of Industry has sent a consultation stating that the bureau's proposal to sign special transportation contracts with silk, tea, porcelain, and other trade associations, as long as the cost is not loss-making, should try its best to reduce freight rates to achieve a win-win situation, which is the key to maintaining domestic goods and developing shipping. However, the bureau has not stated to what extent the original fixed water freight rates for the above-mentioned goods can be reduced. Although the ministry has forwarded the order, it is feared that merchants are still waiting to see. If the bureau first checks the usual practice, determines a reduction method, and then the ministry forwards the order to the trade associations for compliance, it seems more practical. It is appropriate to consult and request investigation, implement the method, and reply. Do not delay this order.</p>

<p>Song Zheyuan sent a letter to the China Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots, saying that respectfully, a few days ago, the representatives of your association, Shen Huilian, Wang Xiaoying, and Wei Qiongying, came to the defense area and sent 4,000 yuan and 2,000 catties of pickles, which were received in full and thanked for.

I am deeply grateful for the repeated help. I am writing to express my thanks. I hope you will understand. Sincerely, China Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots.</p>
<p>Three Representatives of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Mexico and Staying in Shanghai Jointly Issue a Statement</p>
<h3 id="e88">Expressing Gratitude for Assistance and Renewing Appeals for Relief, Detailing the Reasons for Chinese Exclusion and the Suffering Endured <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Over four thousand Chinese nationals who were expelled from Mexico and have returned to our country in succession. Currently remaining in Shanghai are the three representatives of the victims who returned the day before yesterday (the 12th), Mr. Huang Zhulin, Mr. Lin Wenli, and Mr. Lin Huiyao, who are carrying out various relief efforts in Shanghai. The following is a record of their joint statement issued yesterday:</p>
<p>Gratitude for Assistance: The refugee Chinese arrived in Shanghai on the President Hoover ship the day before yesterday (the 12th). They were met by Mr. Peng Canguang, the General Manager of the Shanghai Global Overseas Chinese General Association, who personally came to the ship to express his condolences and lead all the refugee Chinese ashore. In addition to providing meals and lodging, they were also given ten silver dollars per person. The Overseas Chinese General Association is not only capable of participating in practical work for overseas Chinese, but its key personnel also possess a spirit of dedication that is tireless day and night, which is truly admirable. On this occasion, Chairman Wu Chengyu of the association personally hosted the refugees, and Chairman Guo Shun personally went to the new customs wharf to supervise everything, which made the refugee Chinese feel very grateful. They all unanimously joined the association to show their sincere support. This time, they also received extensive publicity from the Shanghai press, which had a significant impact on the relief negotiations and benefited the future of the refugee Chinese in no small measure. In addition, they received 1,000 yuan donated by Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai and Honorary Chairman of the Overseas Chinese General Association, for relief purposes. Mayor Wu is truly the driving force behind this relief effort for the refugee Chinese. We, on behalf of all the refugee Chinese, express our sincere gratitude.</p>
<p>Purpose of Staying in Shanghai: Approximately four thousand Mexican refugee Chinese have already been deported back to China, and there are more than four times that number (approximately 20,000) who will continue to return to the country one after another. If no measures are taken to maintain them, how can their future be ensured? Therefore, the refugee Chinese have designated Shanghai as the economic and political center of our country and specially dispatched us (three representatives) to stay in Shanghai in order to carry out various necessary tasks under the leadership of the Global Overseas Chinese General Association, such as appealing for relief from all sectors and urging the government to negotiate. This is the purpose of our staying in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Establishing an Association to Maintain the Refugees: With so many refugees returning to the country at once, if a comprehensive relief plan is not devised in advance, these refugees will either become beggars or turn into bandits, which is extremely dangerous. Although the central government has been saying that it will find ways to provide relief, the Chinese exclusion in Mexico has a history of two years, and no practical measures have been seen. The government's neglect of the refugees is excessive; this is a factual representation and not a criticism of the government. We are also well aware that the government is in a difficult situation during this time of national crisis. What we hope from the government is that since there is no solution, we can only seek self-reliance by devising our own solutions and asking the government for help. This is a matter of vital interest to us, and it is imperative to establish an association for maintenance.</p>
<p>Requesting Relief: Overseas Chinese have always done their best to contribute to the revolutionary public welfare undertakings of the motherland, which is well known and need not be elaborated upon. This time, our overseas Chinese in Mexico have unfortunately suffered a major disaster, and their situation is extremely tragic. They have homes but cannot return. We can only appeal to the charitable people in the country and our compatriots in the concession to provide generous relief. We also hope that the important figures in the party and the country will remember their roots and provide material assistance to alleviate the suffering of tens of thousands of refugee Chinese in Mexico and provide them with effective follow-up measures. This will not only benefit the individual refugees themselves but will also be of considerable importance to the national honor.</p>
<p>Distant Causes of Chinese Exclusion: The Chinese exclusion in Mexico began on June 12, 1931. The most active initiator was Mr. Wan Nuoshi, a member of the Mexican Congress. Under the leadership of Mr. Wan, a group of unemployed hooligans and unemployed workers organized the Chinese Exclusion Party, with Mr. Wan concurrently serving as one of the chairmen of the party. In fact, the promotion of Chinese exclusion in Mexico this time contained economic and political factors. The Mexican government was the driving force behind the manipulation and planning of Chinese exclusion. In terms of economics, our overseas Chinese in Mexico did have a great influence in commerce and agriculture, which was not only envied by the Mexican government and people but also aroused the desire for competition and plunder among foreign residents in Mexico (such as the Japanese). At that time, Mexican intellectuals also suffered from increasing unemployment due to the global economic impact. In terms of politics, Mexican politics has always been complex. The central and local governments often have different opinions, and there are different opinions on Chinese exclusion and pro-Chinese sentiments. When the pro-Chinese faction is in power, the overseas Chinese in Mexico can live and work in peace. If the Chinese exclusion faction gains power, it will arbitrarily oppress, expel, and abuse them. Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces are important provinces in Mexico, where Chinese business and agriculture are concentrated. Whenever Chinese exclusion incidents occur, the overseas Chinese in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces suffer the most. These two provinces are the source of Chinese exclusion. These are the distant causes of Chinese exclusion in Mexico.</p>
<p>Immediate Causes of Chinese Exclusion: Since Mexico launched Chinese exclusion, after a certain period of lessons, our government, in addition to adopting empty gestures of negotiation, has had no other effective measures, which has led to contempt from all levels of Mexican society. From contempt to arbitrary actions, from arbitrary actions to reckless abuse, the government advocates it, the people echo it, and thus a very orderly Chinese exclusion movement has evolved. Recently, because our country lost the Northeast, the Mexican government and people were even more contemptuous and became even more severe. On January 1st of this year, it happened to be the day when Mr. Manuel Paix of the Chinese Exclusion Party took office as the governor of Shanxi Province. As a result, the atmosphere of Chinese exclusion rose sharply, and the Chinese Exclusion Party went out to act wantonly. This is the immediate cause of Chinese exclusion in Mexico.</p>
<p>Suffering Greatly: Since the revival of Chinese exclusion, our overseas Chinese in Mexico have been unable to stand in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The Mexican government is implementing the most stringent Chinese exclusion policy against Chinese Confucian scholars, especially imposing unprecedented harsh restrictions on Chinese businessmen. Every Chinese store must employ at least eight Mexican workers out of ten people. Not only that, but the business tax has been increased from ten yuan to one hundred yuan. Chinese businessmen certainly cannot accept this unreasonable harsh regulation. Our diplomatic authorities are limited in their power and cannot negotiate for cancellation, so they have no choice but to voluntarily auction off their existing goods at low prices. This loss is counted in the tens of millions. The Mexican government also instigated the Chinese Exclusion Party to rob the overseas Chinese of their property and certificates (i.e., residence permits). At the same time, the Mexican government issued an order under the pretext of protecting foreigners, uniformly inspecting the certificates, but unbeknownst to them, the Chinese certificates had already been robbed by the Chinese Exclusion Party. As a result, there was a panic of "illegal residence," and the police authorities in various places simultaneously ordered the arrest of Chinese without certificates. The overseas Chinese in Mexico suffered the loss of property and were illegally arrested and expelled, using such cruel methods to inflict tangible and intangible suffering on the overseas Chinese in Mexico.</p>
<p>Smuggling into the United States: Our overseas Chinese, witnessing the cruel methods of the Mexican government, fled their homes and smuggled into the United States to avoid danger. The United States government was also well aware of the plight of the overseas Chinese in Mexico who were forced to smuggle into the United States this time. It was still able to provide humanitarian assistance with travel expenses and send them back to China, for which we are very grateful. Upon returning to our country, the so-called largest metropolis of Shanghai, apart from the Overseas Chinese General Association launching relief efforts and Mayor Wu providing assistance, the rest of the government and various organizations are indifferent, which is truly regrettable. Now that the Overseas Chinese General Association has launched relief efforts and entrusted the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Bank (No. 9 Jiujiang Road) to handle the collection of funds, we hope that all sectors at home and abroad will generously contribute to this righteous cause in order to pool the strength of everyone and provide relief to these tens of thousands of innocent refugees. We, on behalf of the refugees, express our deep gratitude.</p>

<p>Formal Contract Signed Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration invited bids for the reconstruction of the destroyed site of the North Railway Station. The bid was opened on the first of this month and was won by the Zhongnan Construction Company. The construction cost is estimated at 50,146 yuan. The Administration has submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to Shanghai to jointly sign a contract with the company. It is now known that the original text of the contract was completed last Saturday and is scheduled to be formally signed today (Monday). As for the construction project, it has already begun to be constructed, and the old houses are currently being demolished. It is expected to be completed in three months. The building has two floors. The upper floor is used for the offices of the Traffic Department, and the lower floor is used as a ticket office and waiting room. Because it is a temporary nature (the station must be moved in the future), the rebuilt building is not very elaborate.</p>

<p>During This Time of Suppressing Bandits and Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Do Not Fall into the Trap of Internal Strife</p>
<p>According to Xinhua News Agency, Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou of the Sichuan Army have recently started disputes again. On the 6th of this month, Liu sent two brigades to attack Wenjiang County, the defense area of Deng Xihou's 28th Army. At that time, Deng's troops were caught off guard, and only the Mashizhong regiment was stationed in the county seat. They were outnumbered and immediately retreated to Pixian County. At this moment, the two sides are in a stalemate, and a great war is about to break out. It is reported that after receiving the report, the Central Government immediately sent telegrams to both Liu and Deng to stop military action and wait for a peaceful resolution. It is also learned that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission, also sent a telegram to the Sichuan Army. The original text is recorded as follows (above omitted): "The Sichuan Army must not take the opportunity to invade and occupy the defense areas of other troops, starting internal strife and creating opportunities for the Red bandits. Generals Liu Xiang, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and others of the Sichuan Army, since Liu Wenhui's transfer, have disregarded national survival during this period of suppressing bandits and resisting Japan and have considered personal rights, which is extremely inappropriate. A separate telegram has been sent to Liu, ordering him to quickly return to his original defense area and stop the dispute to avoid delaying the overall situation, otherwise effective measures will be taken to stop it, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e91">Japanese Steamships Attempt to Fully Resume Navigation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Reducing Freight Rates to Compete with National Vessels, Plans to Increase Ships Between Hankou and Yichang</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Japanese merchants have been encroaching on inland river navigation rights in our country for many years. However, since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Shanghai War, the business of Japanese ships has plummeted, and many Japanese shipping companies have suspended operations. Now they are gradually recovering, but they have not yet returned to their original state. At present, Japanese merchants are planning to restore their original shipping services and add more ships. The following is an exploration of the situation:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Area: The Yangtze River route from Shanghai to Hankou has always been operated by ships from the China Merchants Bureau, Ning Shao Company, British Jardine Matheson Company, Taikoo Company, and Japanese Nisshin Company, totaling more than 70 ships, and Japanese ships accounted for the most, accounting for more than 40 ships. Since the outbreak of the Shenyang Incident and the Shanghai War, these more than 40 Japanese ships have had almost no passengers and no cargo, and they have been suspended for several months. As a result, the import of Japanese goods into the interior has almost disappeared. The Japanese government secretly subsidized the country's shipping companies, and later gradually resumed sailing, but has not yet returned to its original state. It is now known that Japanese shipping companies have decided to restore all of their ships to operation and plan to reduce freight rates in an attempt to seize all of the Yangtze River shipping, and there are also plans to increase the number of sailings on the Hankou-Yichang route.</p>
<p>South China Shipping: In the South China region, apart from a few mail ships operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha, there is no Japanese shipping organization dedicated to operating in the South China region. Moreover, it is learned that the movement to boycott Japanese goods in Guangdong is very strong, so there are currently no plans to develop South China shipping.</p>
<p>Monopoly of North China: North China's shipping rights have long been seized by Japanese merchants. Japanese merchants have a considerable history of operating shipping in North China. At present, although some Chinese shipping companies can nominally compete with Japanese merchants on the North China route, according to shipping industry sources, some two shipping companies have Japanese shares secretly, which has aroused the attention of the Maritime Administration and will be investigated. According to Japanese shipping industry sources, the Japanese puppet government will add ships between Andong and Dalian so that goods from the three northeastern provinces can be transported to Dalian for transshipment and sale to various places.</p>
<h3 id="e92">National Traveler Sun Leshan's Letter Informs of the Situation in Jiangxi Province: Banditry Unsuppressed, Everything Abnormal <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Sun Leshan, a national traveler from Anhui Province, has traveled upstream along the Yangtze River and has now reached Wuchang via Anhui and Jiangxi. Mr. Sun has sent a letter to the agency about the situation he observed along the way. The first letter is recorded as follows: "Jiangxi Province is rich in products, and those famous throughout the country include porcelain, summer cloth, Jiangxi wood, black tea, and paper. Today, due to the influence of soldiers and bandits, none of them have been revitalized, and the business markets have also declined. The current situation of each industry is recorded below for readers' information: Jingdezhen is the place of porcelain production, and its sales rank first in the country. In recent years, it has been ravaged by the Red bandits, and the porcelain workers have long been dispersed, and the industry has been stagnant. Compared with the past, it has fallen sharply. Later, the authorities made every effort to maintain the industry, and the banditry was slightly suppressed, and the porcelain workers also came to the town one after another to prepare to resume work. The kiln owners were also busy planning. Unexpectedly, the local banditry was slightly suppressed, and the situation in North China became tense. Since the loss of Rehe, the porcelain in the town has been greatly affected. Normally, millions of pieces are sold every year, and porcelain merchants from all over the country have special commissioners stationed in the town to purchase. This time, the Japanese pirates invaded Rehe, and the peace in Tianjin was shocked. Rumors abounded, and merchants held tight and advocated contraction, and telegraphed Jingdezhen to stop purchasing, which caused workers in various counties to become unemployed again. In previous years, the kilns were opened on March 1st, but this year they have not been opened on April 1st. More than 100,000 porcelain workers have no work to do. The summer cloth of Wanzai is favored by various provinces. Recently, due to the improvement of materials, ladies from all walks of life mostly use Indian silk and fine cloth instead of summer cloth. According to the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce, recently, the summer cloth shipped to Shanghai has actually been returned in its original boxes, and the summer cloth is too narrow and the tailoring is too uneconomical. This is also a major reason for the failure. Wuning black tea has always been sold to Russia and has a considerable history in international trade. Since the severance of relations between China and Russia, tea farmers have not hired workers to pick tea because the price of tea is not enough to pay the tea pickers, so the tea leaves are mostly allowed to fall by themselves and are used as fuel. Although China and Russia have resumed relations recently, the banditry has not ended, and no one has continued to operate. Most of the wood used in the Gan River Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Yellow River Basin comes from Gan County, Jiangxi. Gan County is famous throughout the country for its lush forests. Since 1928, Gan County has become a bandit area, and postal services have been cut off. The people of Gan County cannot go downstream smoothly, and timber merchants are helping the old and the young to escape. Although the forest is good, they cannot take care of it. It is sad to say that the sales volume of Nanchang paper in various provinces is also very considerable. In recent years, the handicrafts of our country have been suppressed by imported products and machine-made products. The price of domestic goods is too expensive and the thickness is uneven, resulting in more losses. Recently, the primary and secondary schools in Nanchang use Italian paper, which is newspaper paper. Because the education funds are difficult, they have to use cheap and good imported products. This is the recent overview of the five major products of Jiangxi. All industries in Nanchang market use radio calls, but the people's purchasing power is weak. General stores are desolate and deserted. Commerce is so declining, but the population has increased. According to the person in charge of the investigation, the population has suddenly increased by more than 100,000 in recent years. These 100,000 people are refugees from the disaster areas. From the reverse side, the population is dense, but in fact, most of them are unemployed and homeless. According to the recent survey by the Liguo Education Hall, there were 3,000 people in the Nanchang money industry, and 1,000 people have recently lost their jobs. There were more than 300 porcelain households, and recently they have been reduced to the outside households. More than 2,000 people in the foreign goods industry have lost their jobs. There were originally more than 3,000 rickshaws, and recently they have been reduced to less than 2,000. The paper industry had an operating revenue of 4 million in previous years, and recently it has been reduced to 1 million or less. As for the expenses of various agencies and schools in the province, they are paid at 80% or 70% across the board. During the national crisis, salaries are paid at 80%, and the people of this province cooperate in suppressing the Communist bandits, and then they are paid at 70%. In addition, there are salary arrears, and the lower-level staff are almost unemployed. The local authorities in various counties also need to assess the financial resources of the people and raise funds for suppressing the Communist bandits. The county magistrates are privately corrupt and abuse the villagers, and the villagers often report to the administrative inspector and the provincial authorities. There are many middle schools in Nanchang because of the increase in population. In addition to the provincial medical college, the engineering college, the agricultural college, the commercial college, the first middle school, the second middle school, the first vocational school, the second vocational school, the girls' middle school, and the girls' vocational school in the provincial capital, there are also more than ten private middle schools. Among them, except for a few schools with specialized skills, the remaining middle schools have become factories for manufacturing middle-level hooligans. The children in the bandit area often hear that their houses have been destroyed and their families have been killed. The schools are also often stationed by troops, and many of them have no intention of studying, and the school authorities are also inevitably negligent in their business."</p>

On the same day, another telegram stated, "I have received your telegram, and I have learned that the enemy has recently received a large number of reinforcements, aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles in the territory of Duolun, and there are plans for a counterattack, but I have deployed several lines of defense and have solid work. If the enemy attacks, I will definitely defend the original line to the death and will not give up an inch of land. I beg you to convey to all sectors that the defense line of Zhuan Duo will definitely be defended to the end. Please release the thought that I am extremely concerned about the extraordinary care and support you have given me in the past few months.

<h3 id="e94">Record of the Third Day of Raising Aviation Funds and Mobilizing Boy Scouts <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The total mobilization of 3,000 Boy Scouts in this city to raise the National Aviation Salvation Fund was the last day yesterday, and the results were quite good. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fundraising Situation: Yesterday was the third day of Boy Scout fundraising. As it was a Sunday, many teams went to the Yimiao and the entrances of various theaters, amusement parks, and dance halls, where tourists were concentrated, starting at 2 p.m. Although the results have not yet been announced, it is predicted that the results will be better than the previous two days.</p>
<p>Generous Donations from Foreigners: Yesterday, when the Boy Scouts of the Southeast Team on Nanjing Road were fundraising, a British man generously donated four silver dollars. When the Chinese saw that the blue-eyed people also knew how to love China and help our National Aviation Salvation Movement to resist the bullies, they were all greatly moved. For a time, many people took out their wallets to respond, and the Boy Scouts were overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Generous Donations from Chinese: A small Boy Scout on Yunnan Road was fundraising from pedestrians when a person in a chartered car passed by. When he saw that the Boy Scout was very young, and heard his euphemistic and persuasive words, he was deeply moved, so he did not wait for the Boy Scout to come forward to solicit donations and immediately donated five yuan. This gentleman had already joined the association and wore the solicitation badge on his chest. His enthusiastic donation is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Efforts of the Boy Scouts: The Boy Scout teams worked very hard during this total mobilization. For example, the Patriotic Team and the Southeast Team worked from Jiangwan to Nanjing Road and the Bund all day long and were extremely tired. However, because this total mobilization was for the survival of the nation, the Boy Scout teams were not afraid of any difficulties.</p>
<p>Fundraising Results: The fundraising results of each team varied from more than a thousand yuan to several hundred yuan per day. The results of the three-day mobilization must be considerable. It is now learned that the results of the first day are announced as follows: Southeast Team 1,000 yuan, Team One 42 yuan, Yucai Team 157 yuan, Patriotic Team 55 yuan, Guangdong Team 56 yuan, Youth Team 78 yuan. Those who have not yet deposited in the bank could not be counted. It is said that all of them will be announced soon, and we can wait and see. It is heard that the funds raised by each team will be deposited directly into the Shanghai Bank. When each team has odd amounts, it can be exchanged for silver dollars or silver dollar cents and deposited into the bank.</p>
<p>Insane and Crazy: When the Southeast Girl Scout was fundraising at the Zhimeilou on Simalu at about 8 o'clock, Tao Qiqing, a teacher at Qiaoguang Middle School, was insane and scolded wantonly. All the guests present were indignant and unanimously ordered him to donate on the spot. The Girl Scout, feeling insulted, burst into tears and reported to the regiment headquarters. The regiment leader, Luo Lie, led the Girl Scout to investigate the truth, and the guests present testified and mediated, ordering Tao Qiqing to apologize to the regiment in writing within two days. The Boy Scouts are serving the country, and Tao, as a member of the education community, is acting in such a way that is truly abominable.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation's International Radio Station is building several 160-foot-high antenna iron towers in Zhenru, Liuhang, and other places in order to directly communicate with the United Kingdom and has ordered two sets of transceivers from the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company at a cost of more than 800,000 yuan in Chinese currency. The machines have been shipped to Shanghai in succession, and there are about 1,500 large and small components. Construction has begun, and it is expected to be completed in mid-October and can be reported in the spring of 1935. According to the engineer of the radio station, in addition to ordering parts from the UK, the Ministry of Transportation has also sent the engineers Sun Hongjun, Lu Zongcheng, Lin Dinghu, and Hu Mingti to the British Marconi Company for internships last month. According to the report from Sun and others, they have safely arrived in London. After about three months of internship, they will also go to various European countries to conduct on-the-spot investigations as a reference for the development of the wireless communications industry in our country. It is heard that the last batch of components will also be escorted to China by Sun and others.</p>

<p>The Third District Party Department of the Seven Cities telegraphed the Central Committee members to concentrate in the capital to jointly discuss major plans to alleviate the national crisis. The text of the telegram is as follows (omitted): "Our party is called the party in power. At this time when the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, who else is responsible for defending against insults and saving the country except our party members? How should all party members be vigilant and strive to be self-motivated? The Central Committee is the place where the power of the whole party lies, and the Central Committee members are the elites selected by the whole party. If we want to save the country, we must first improve the Central Committee. If we want to improve the Central Committee, we must rely on the responsibility of all the Central Committee members. Now, you comrades bear the weight of the trust of the whole party and have been selected as Central Committee members, but because of the differences in political opinions or the disputes in opinions, you are scattered in various places and regard the Central Committee as if it were a foreign country that has nothing to do with your own well-being, causing our party to fall into a state of disintegration, and the affairs of China are even more unbearable because of this. You comrades, even if you do not cherish the party, how can you not plan for the country? Is it necessary to perish together before you are happy? The comrades of this association bet on this situation and want to cry without tears. They are in pain for the danger of the party and the country, and they dare not avoid the ax and honestly present the situation. They beg all comrades to sacrifice their personal views, abandon personal suspicions, and immediately gather in the capital to jointly discuss major plans to save the country, so as to save the party's fortunes and alleviate the national crisis. This is a telegram, and I beg you to inspect and approve it. The Third District Party Department of the Kuomintang of China in Shanghai Special City."</p>

<p>Shanghai: The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for Henan, Anhui, and Hubei received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces, stating that the areas in need of relief are in dire straits and cannot afford any interruption. He requested that the remaining unallocated funds be promptly disbursed to benefit the disaster-stricken people. The association responded to Chiang today with a telegram that reads: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang, General Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces, Nanchang. We have received and acknowledged your confidential telegram No. 257 from the Financial Department, indicating that the people in the disaster area are becoming increasingly impoverished and that you share our deep concern for the relief situation. However, our association has repeatedly faced difficulties in fundraising due to the impact of the current situation. The previous allocation of 100,000 yuan from your department was, as previously explained, borrowed from banks and money houses in the city. We hope you understand that with the decline of various industries, fundraising has become increasingly challenging. The previous loans from banks and money houses have not yet been repaid and are still being raised. In response to your telegram, we can only do our best to appeal for help to meet your expectations. We respectfully reply to inform you and pray for your understanding. (The rest omitted)"</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association recently received a report from the Meixian Relief Branch in Shaanxi Province, stating in a most urgent message: "Meixian County has suffered from disasters since 1928, with five years of failed harvests. The situation in 1932 and 1933 is even worse than in 1929 and 1930. Initially, people could dismantle houses, sell firewood, and sell their wives and children. Later, even wives and children could not find buyers, and houses were empty. Land prices are only one dime per mu, attracting buyers from other counties. Daughters are sold for three yuan each and become ghosts in foreign lands. Starved corpses line the roads. Even office staff have sunken cheeks and hollow eyes, filling their bellies with vegetable soup, constantly worried about interruptions, let alone coarse rice. In Tianjiapo, Southeast Township, a family of four in Guo Zhenfen's family starved to death. The wife, Wu, even cut flesh from her own buttocks to eat. Some criticized her, but who could know the desperation of a woman driven to such extremes by starvation? We urgently request relief, either in the form of food or seeds. Life or death, flesh or bone, we eagerly await assistance." Furthermore, the Tongxiang Disaster Relief Committee in Quanyi County reported that the disaster situation in the county has worsened in recent years, with everyone running out of food and every household running out of supplies. The number of disaster victims who are on the brink of death and desperately need relief is estimated to be over 30,000. Deaths are increasing dramatically. In addition, various tragedies such as suicides by drowning and poisoning occur frequently. It is now the beginning of summer, the time to sow autumn crops. Disaster victims are struggling to survive and have no seeds or labor. Even with rainfall, there is no way to plant. If the land is left barren again, it will inevitably lead to a complete catastrophe. We urgently request assistance. In addition to the 6,000 yuan in transportation costs urgently needed for relief in Xi'an, which the association will remit in installments, the association has also allocated 1,000 yuan for transportation, and yesterday allocated another 1,500 yuan, all of which will be transferred to the Shaanxi branch through the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank. We have no funds to help with the other urgent disasters in other counties and can do nothing. We especially hope that compassionate and virtuous people at home and abroad will join hands in providing assistance."</p>

<h3 id="e104">Market Strike in Jiading County Due to Ban on Lantern Parades <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Dozens of Police and Civilians Injured</p>
<p>According to the old custom in Jiading County, there would be lantern shows and dragon boat races around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar. This practice has been discontinued for many years. This year, someone suddenly initiated it again. Lantern shows have already been held outside the East Gate, Shagang Gate of the South Gate, the Western Gate, and Loutang of the North Gate. However, no events had been held in the city center. The day before yesterday (the 13th), someone was collecting stamps in various shops in the city to organize a lantern show. This was discovered by the captain of the county police, who arrested two people on the spot, leading to a clash between the police and the civilians. Dozens of people were injured on both sides, and yesterday, the entire city went on strike, escalating the unrest. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Incident Details: At around 10 AM the day before yesterday, Chen Xingquan, Chen Delin, and others were collecting stamps from shops such as Ruidasheng, Hongyuanguan, Beiyongda, Pingminlej, Wufeng, Zhengtai, Dacheng Yong, Qiaoyongxing, Taihe, Zhou Yongrun, Tongtaichang, Runyuanguan, Longji, Yuelaixi, and Fengshentai to organize a lantern show. Gao Baozhen, the captain of the county police, led a patrol and arrested Chen Xingquan and Chen Delin, along with the booklets, and sent them to the county government. Xu Weizhen, the county magistrate, handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for detention. The booklets contained words such as "Celebrating Victory." In the afternoon, Magistrate Xu ordered the police to work with the Public Security Bureau to strengthen prevention. At around 6 PM, three to four hundred people gathered in the City God Temple outside the East Gate, demanding the release of Chen Xingquan and Chen Delin and insisting on holding a lantern show. The Public Security Bureau sent Chief Inspector Liu Rongxiang, leading several unarmed policemen, to persuade them, but they were unable to control the large crowd. Since the City God Temple was very close to the county government, the merchants and civilians stormed the entrance of the county government. Shouts and cries arose. The entire police force was dispatched to stop them, but to no avail. They fired several shots into the air, which only further incited the crowd. Both sides started fighting. The civilians threw bricks at the county government, resulting in many injuries on both sides. It is said that forty to fifty civilians were injured and went to Kunshan, Suzhou, Taicang, and other places for treatment.</p>
<p>Injury Investigation: A total of seven people were injured from the Public Security Bureau. Chen Changqing suffered a head injury, and Qin Wenli suffered a leg injury. The injuries of these two were the most serious and life-threatening. Five others suffered minor injuries. As for the civilians, it was impossible to find out at the moment. Several eyewitnesses were interviewed, and their testimonies are listed below: Shen Xingquan suffered severe injuries to his waist and back. Gu Er'er, the owner of a pastry shop, was reportedly eating dinner in the shop when he was driven out by the police and suffered injuries to his head, waist, abdomen, hands, shoulders, legs, etc. Gu's wife, Yang, was grazed by a bullet on her forehead. A shop assistant, Han Yongqi, was injured in the shoulder. Xu Adi was injured in the hand. Zhang Bao was injured in the head, waist, hands, chest, and abdomen. Shen Agui was injured in the head. Others either went to the hospital or received treatment at home, and it was impossible to find out at the moment. Market Strike: After the reporter learned about this yesterday morning, he drove to Zhabei at 9 AM and took the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus to Jiading. He arrived at Jiading Station at 10 AM and hired a rickshaw to enter the city. When he arrived at the county government, Magistrate Xu was convening a meeting with the county chamber of commerce and other organizations. He could not attend the meeting, so he was interviewed by a section chief, who confirmed the details, which were similar to the reporter's investigation. When he left, he saw many civilians still gathered at the entrance of the county government, and there were various opinions. More than a dozen policemen guarded the entrance with guns. He then went to various streets and alleys and saw that all the shops were on strike. Only a few food shops opened small doors or a side door to serve customers. There were no policemen on duty in the city, just like the lunar New Year's Day. He took a bus back to Shanghai at 3 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Police Officer Wu Linqing Shoots a Madman <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Wu Linqing has been detained</p>
<p>Dachunpu from Nanjing, 35 years old, lived in Zhoujin Pailou in the city and worked as a peddler. Because of his mental illness, he had a manic episode after drinking alcohol on the 12th of this month. He held a kitchen knife and ran wildly on the road, randomly slashing, injuring Lou Xinru, and then ran towards Xueyuan Road. Police officer Wu Linqing chased after him. The madman slashed the police officer's wrist with the knife. The police officer immediately opened fire and pursued him. According to the family of the deceased, the third shot hit the madman's abdomen. The madman was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and died of his injuries the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the No. 2 Police Station of District 1 ordered Di Jia Zhang Fu to report to the court for an autopsy. After prosecutor Zhang and others arrived at the hospital and verified the details, they ordered the family to collect the body. His parents claimed that the police officer had acted recklessly and caused the death of an innocent person, and they requested redress. The official instructed them to submit the case to the police station for review and processing by the court. Police officer Wu Linqing has been detained by Police Chief Liu since the madman's death.</p>

The thief snatched the gold earring from Shen Shen's right ear. Her ear was torn and bleeding. Fortunately, a passing woman witnessed the tragedy and tightly held the thief. Police officer Yang Siling from the District 1 Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrived and arrested the thief, recovering the stolen goods. The thief confessed, "Zhao Fuyin, 34 years old, from Tongzhou, lives at the No. 16 Pu Wharf," admitting to the robbery. After verifying his confession, the police station ordered the victim Shen Shen to retrieve her stolen gold earring on the spot and ordered Zhao to be sent to the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Lei Zaixi, the police chief of the Hejiajiao Police Station of the No. 2 Branch of the No. 6 District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a report yesterday afternoon at 4 PM from Zhong Yuehua from Fujian and Xue Zhiming from Chongming, stating that they had taken a Yinghai Motor Company car, license number 571 and rental license number 12197, from the Old North Gate Minquan Road to Zhenru. Xue Zhiming was driving. Because there were two leather boxes of opium in the car, they took the route from Xieqiao in Nanshi to Tushanwan, turning into Zhongshan Road to reach Zhenru. When the car reached the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Daxi Road, seven robbers suddenly jumped out of the roadside, each holding a handgun, and blocked their path. They forcibly dragged them and the driver Xue Zhiming from the car. Another robber drove the car away towards the north. The opium belonged to the owner of the Tongchunhua Opium Company, entrusted to them to transport. Each box contained eight packages, and each package contained 150 taels, totaling approximately 6,000 yuan. Police Chief Lei immediately sent police to pursue the robbers, but they had already gone far. He took Zhong and Xue to the police station for interrogation. Police Chief Wu interrogated them briefly. Considering that the case involved a daylight robbery, he feared there was more to the story and sent Zhong Yuehua and driver Xue Zhiming to the bureau yesterday afternoon for a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Establishment of the Chinese Archaeological Society <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Adoption of Constitution and Resolutions</p>
<p>Election of Cai Yuanpei and Others as Directors</p>
<p>The Chinese Archaeological Society held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM in the Mingfu Library of the Science Society of China on Avenue Albert. The meeting adopted the constitution, passed resolutions, and elected directors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: The attending members included Cai Yuanpei, Yang Quan, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Jiyuan, Liu Haisu, Zhang Feng, Teng Gu, Wei Juxian, Guan Baiyi, Gu Xieyuan, Lu Danlin, Ding Zhonghu, Zheng Shixu, Wang Xiantang, Jin Zutong, Chen Zhiliang, Wu Yichang, Zhang Shuxun, Ma Gongyu, Fang Jiekan, Zheng Zunxiang, Shi Taolu, Gu Dingmei, and Huang Tiren, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, totaling over thirty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: After the meeting commenced, Chairman Cai Yuanpei presided, with Wang Jiyuan as secretary. Following the ceremony, Mr. Cai delivered an address, stating, "The establishment of this archaeological society today may seem like a non-urgent matter. However, human thought has its own strengths, and each should contribute their expertise. Archaeological work can help understand national character and facilitate comparisons with the world. It reveals not only national character but also local characteristics, showcasing local color. Each region has its unique features that we must understand. Antiquities have their temporal context, and every nation has its own era. This applies to humans and animals alike. In the past, communication between nations was inconvenient. Now, other nations admire the culture of the East. Consequently, they use money to buy antiquities. Many of our nation's treasures have been lost overseas. The Japanese say that Chinese people don't need to visit China to see antiquities; they can go to Japan. During the January 28th Incident, the Japanese destroyed our Eastern culture and eradicated traces of our national culture. They are indeed determined to study Eastern culture in Japan. Given this situation, we must strive for self-preservation. England and France repeatedly search for the essence of antiquities for preservation, leaving behind less important items, which will be very dangerous in the future. It is remarkable that we are pursuing this work with archaeological interest and ambition."</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: Next, Huang Tiren, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, followed by Ye Gongchuo, one of the initiators, who reported on the preparatory process, stating, "The reason for establishing this society has been clearly explained by Mr. Cai Zimin. In fact, there is a great need for an archaeological society nationwide, but it has been lacking for many years. Colleagues in Shanghai, aware of this, actively prepared and now announce its establishment. Cultural aggression has been increasing recently, and the impact has also been growing. Moreover, due to internal unrest, antiquities are flowing overseas in greater numbers. Colleagues believe that it is necessary to first improve the situation in Shanghai within possible limits. However, we feel that our strength is weak and our knowledge is shallow, making it difficult to bear this heavy responsibility. Therefore, we invited famous individuals in the country and people with experience and interest in archaeology to a preparatory meeting in March. Initially, the name was set as the Chinese Art and Archaeological Society, but after further discussions, it was changed to the Chinese Archaeological Society because art cannot encompass archaeology, and its nature is different from archaeology. Furthermore, the scope of research is larger. If art is considered archaeology, the meaning cannot be determined. In modern times, archaeology is a specialized science, and there are few researchers in the country. Our society will use archaeology as a basis for archaeological work, hoping that everyone will contribute. We originally planned to hold the meeting in April, but members are scattered throughout the country, and communication takes time, causing the meeting to be delayed until today. Although the number of attendees is not large, most people from Ping, Jin, Hang, Su, Yue, and other regions have not been able to attend but have sent letters urging us to proceed with the work. This is the preparatory process of our society over the past two months."</p>

<p>A Young Girl from Huzhou Was Shocked and Eloped After Ten Days</p>
<p>Her Biological Mother Was Unreliable, So She Came to Shanghai to Rely on Her Adoptive Mother</p>
<p>The Elderly Groom Came to Shanghai to Search for Her and Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Yang Yueying, a young girl from Huzhou, is twenty-one years old. She has a beautiful figure, a slender build, and is dressed fashionably. Anyone who sees her would consider her a modern woman. After the girl was born to her mother, Yang Shen, due to having too many children and a poor family situation, she was sent to an orphanage before she was even a month old. She was cared for by the orphanage for two years. Suddenly, a woman from the same village, Shi Qian, seeing the girl's bright and lovely complexion, took her home from the orphanage as her adopted daughter.</p>
<p>She was raised and cared for by Ms. Shi, who loved her very much. However, the girl's biological mother, Ms. Shen, lived nearby Ms. Qian. Therefore, she knew all the details of the adoption by Ms. Qian. When the girl reached adulthood and was beautiful and intelligent, her biological mother often saw her on the road and was filled with love and pity. She secretly told the girl about the circumstances of her birth and seduced her in every way. As a result, the girl's intelligence gradually opened, and it was difficult to forget the bond of flesh and blood. At the age of seventeen, she secretly returned to her biological mother's home and moved with her mother to a remote village. Although Ms. Shi Qian sent out scouts everywhere, they could not find her. After a year, her biological mother arranged for her to marry Lin Wenzhang, a fellow villager, as a second wife. However, the girl was quite capricious and insisted on seeing what the groom looked like before agreeing. The matchmaker, seeing the girl's determination, secretly arranged for the girl to go to a certain place to secretly peek at the groom. The girl saw that the groom was a youthful gentleman and agreed immediately. On the engagement day, the Lin family sent four gold ornaments and a gift of 250 silver dollars. In mid-April of last year, the wedding was formally held. The Lin family used drums, flags, and a colorful sedan to welcome her into the home. Who knew that when they entered the bridal chamber and shared the pillow, the girl was about to start whispering sweet words to her youthful groom when she suddenly saw that the groom was crude, dark, and old, with a slight beard on his cheeks. She was shocked. How could he be a completely different person from when she first saw him? The girl was intelligent and wise and decided to temporarily endure since what's done is done and wait to investigate further before making a decision. Her biological mother knew that Lin was over forty years old but only knew that he was marrying her as a second wife. Because she coveted Lin's wealth, she used the trick of substituting one thing for another. Even though her biological mother knew, she played along. After the girl married, within ten days, she learned the truth and found out that Lin's first wife was still alive and was a notorious shrew. If she found out, she would definitely come to punish her. Moreover, she would be living in a secondary room. The girl was both angry and afraid. Therefore, before the honeymoon was over, she seized the opportunity and eloped alone. She didn't want to see her biological mother's face again and had no relatives or friends to rely on. So she took a boat to Shanghai and learned the location of Ms. Shi Qian, her adoptive mother, at 26 Huade Road in Western Shanghai. She went to the address, and after seeing each other, they poured out their hearts and wept together. So, their old feelings were rekindled, and they both went to work in a yarn factory to make a living. Unexpectedly, after a year, the elderly groom, Lin Wenzhang, came to Shanghai to find her and temporarily stayed at 32 Gongyi Lane in Caojiadu in Western Shanghai.</p>

<p>He found out where the girl was. The morning before, Lin found out her address. He went to the address and arrested Yang Yueying and Shi Qian together and took them to the 6th District Police Station. After District Officer Jiang questioned them separately, he determined that the case was related to a marital dispute and was complicated. Therefore, he prepared a document and sent them to the local court for further investigation.</p>

<p>Du Laifu, a vendor from Ningbo, is 22 years old and makes a living selling rice wine. He lives at the home of his friend Ma Cailin at No. 201 Ziyoufang, Guangdong Road. On April 16 of this year, Du took advantage of Ma Cailin's absence to drag Ma's nine-year-old daughter Fengying and rape her, prohibiting her from speaking out. He then took the opportunity to continue raping her once more. Shen Lindi, the nine-year-old daughter of Shen Wenqing from No. 200 next door, came to play with Ma Fengying and was also subjected to Du Laifu's violence, being raped three times in total. On the 21st, Ma Fengying suddenly felt severe pain in her lower body and told her mother, Ma Zhang. After questioning her, she told her the truth. She then reported to the Lao Zha Patrol Station, which ordered detectives Huang Yingjie and Bao Tan Wang Rulin to arrest Du. The two girls were sent to the hospital for examination, which confirmed that their hymens had been ruptured and that they had been infected with Du's disease.

<p>New Products from Wanli Paint Factory: In recent years, the construction industry has been developing rapidly. Magnificent buildings are being erected everywhere. However, due to geographical factors or climate changes, moisture often seeps into these grand structures, which not only impairs their appearance but also affects hygiene. The Wanli Paint Factory on Xietu Road in this city has introduced three new products: Rainproof Paint, Safety Paint, and Leak-Repair Paste. These paints can be used to coat walls, eliminating the above-mentioned problems. As these are new products, various brochures and samples are available to meet the needs of the construction industry.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Our team was originally organized by the China Relief Frontline Wounded and Disabled Sanatorium. This sanatorium was established in the 13th year of the Republic and has been protected by the Ministry of the Interior and Military Affairs. The director of our sanatorium's Shanghai office, Cui Kedong, has repeatedly received telegrams from the Beiping General Hospital and the frontline anti-Japanese armies, urging the organization of a rescue team and medical personnel to go north for relief efforts. Wang Hanbin, a preparatory committee member stationed in Shanghai, has been appointed as the captain of the first battalion of the ninth rescue team, with Gu Sheng as the deputy captain, Yin Zongxi as the head nurse, and Zhu Zheng as the chief of general affairs.</p>
<p>The team members and medical staff, including nurses and stretcher-bearers, total more than sixty people. The team was established on the 7th of this month at the Xilin Temple outside the West Gate of Shanghai, and is intensifying training and actively preparing to depart north as soon as possible. The team's officers and staff are striving to raise funds to organize the team. Any additional support is welcome. Anyone who wishes to provide assistance with their knowledge or materials is encouraged to cooperate with us wholeheartedly. We are writing to request your consideration in publicizing this information to the general public, hoping to inspire them to join us in our efforts. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, The First Battalion of the Ninth Rescue and Hygiene Team of the China Relief Frontline Wounded and Disabled Sanatorium, Captain Wang Hanbin. May 14.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read your newspaper on the 12th of this month, the news item titled "French Concession Police Investigation Results of Gao Yatou Murder Case" contains many distortions of the facts, causing Gao Yatou to be unjustly wronged and without assistance. We are submitting a rebuttal news稿 for publication immediately. If it is not convenient to publish it as news, please publish it as a letter to the editor for correction. Sincerely, The Shanghai Barber Industry Committee for Vindication of the Gao Yatou Tragedy, May 14.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Barber Industry Committee for Vindication of the Gao Yatou Tragedy recently saw the news published by various newspapers regarding the announcement by the French Concession Police. They believe that the investigation report and the autopsy process are unsatisfactory. Gao Yatou was only fifteen years old this year and was able to work as a barber. Her physique and energy must be stronger than ordinary people and certainly not that of someone suffering from an illness. The report further stated that "she suffered from lung disease and the cause of death was heart failure, causing her heart to stop beating." A fifteen-year-old child who stands all day with her arms raised to cut hair would cough incessantly if she had lung disease. Not only would customers be disgusted, but she herself would not be able to stand for long. If you do not believe it, ask a strong, healthy person to hold their arms up for an hour and they will be breathless. How much more so for someone who stands all day?</p>
<p>The report also said, "After dissecting and examining the internal organs and external parts of the body, no signs of violence or assault were found." In this case, the committee has sent people to investigate in detail from all sides. (1) Regarding the autopsy, Guo Wanhai, a representative of the deceased's family, personally witnessed two inspections at the scene. First, the abdomen was dissected from the chest to the navel, and the five internal organs were removed, each cut open and examined. Then, the head was sawn open and the brain was sliced and examined. The lower part of the body was not examined. The doctor who performed the examination, even if he could not distinguish whether the injuries were caused by assault or a fall, should have known where the fatal injury was. How could he say that there were no injuries found? The most dangerous parts of the body in a fall are below the abdomen and the scrotum. The hospital and doctors under the authority of the Public Works Department abandoned the examination of the lower part of the body, which is contrary to law and morality. (2) Regarding the cause of death, it was because Gao Yatou forgot to bring her license and ran away in fear. She was chased by a Western policeman in a car, who slapped her twice on the cheeks, causing her to fall. Gao Yatou immediately knelt on the ground to beg for forgiveness. The Western policeman then kicked her with his foot. After being kicked twice, she died on the spot. The crowd saw this uncivilized act and immediately gathered more than a thousand people. The policeman knew that he had caused trouble and fled from Huanlong Road in a car. The crowd followed closely, and the policeman escaped into the Yangtze Motor Company, where he was surrounded by the crowd. There were many people present who were willing to disregard violent oppression and sacrifice their lives to testify and provide detailed accounts of the tragic event. They are all willing to bear the responsibility of witnessing in court in the future. If the report says, "The results of the investigation and autopsy confirm that running was the cause of death. This case is very regrettable, but the police have no responsibility for this matter," according to the above two points, there are considerable facts and responsible witnesses who can prove the facts. Regardless of whether Gao Yatou died instantly under the violent kick of the Western policeman, the recklessness and barbarity of the Western policeman have become ironclad evidence and cannot be denied. If it is said that the French Concession police have no responsibility for this matter, this committee believes that it is a distortion of the facts and expresses its dissatisfaction. In addition to formally requesting a re-examination according to law, we are afraid that readers will be confused by hearsay, so we are making this factual rebuttal. The Shanghai Barber Industry Committee for Vindication of the Gao Yatou Tragedy, May 14.</p>
<h3 id="e131">National Humiliation Week Speech by Mr. Shen Tilan on the May 3rd Massacre (Continued) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>May 10 at the Youth Conference</p>
<p>Two, The May 3rd Massacre and China's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Japan's policy towards China has always been to use discord and instigate civil wars to prevent China from unifying. Starting from Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, then Zhang Xun's restoration, then Anfu's resurgence, then the Zhili-Anhui and Zhili-Fengtian wars, and then the Guo Songling incident, and the Dagu Fort incident, every internal conflict has involved Japan's conspiracy. The difference is that before the May 3rd incident, Japan only courted one Chinese warlord, but after the May 3rd incident, it courted multiple warlords, forming a situation where Chinese warlords were divided and occupied different regions. This shows the progress of imperialist methods of aggression. After the May 3rd incident, they not only courted multiple Chinese warlords but also were able to court or reject various Chinese warlords at any time and place. Perhaps today they collude with warlord A to defeat warlord B, and tomorrow they collude with warlord B to defeat warlord A. This kind of fickle tactic is more beneficial to them. After the May 3rd incident, Japan paid more attention to the rise and fall of reactionary forces in China. They tried to court these forces, inciting them to expand further, even to spread throughout the country. Therefore, Japan has also replaced the military force of warlords with the bureaucratic politicians and comprador class in China. From then on, they knew to penetrate deep into the masses of China to find opportunities for their aggression. This is a major turning point.</p>
<p>Three, The May 3rd Massacre and Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Although Yuan Shikai recognized Japan's Twenty-One Demands, the Twenty-One Demands could not be fully implemented after the discussions at the Washington Conference. Starting from the May 3rd incident, Japan believed that in addition to political and economic aggression, military aggression was needed. Coincidentally, the signs of recession had already appeared, and the internal situation in Japan was also conducive to the rise of 武military thought. Therefore, Japanese warlords decided to adopt direct military aggression against China.</p>
<p>The second point is that since the May 3rd incident, Japan's diplomacy towards China has been focused on using "local incidents" to evade responsibility, making the issues unresolved, and gradually taking advantage of the deception to seize rights. This method is used to make the powers speechless, while Japan enjoys the benefits. The Jinan Incident, the September 18th Incident, Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, Rehe, and even the recent Chahar War since the Jinan Massacre, they have all been resolved using the small "local incident" label!</p>
<p>This is the impact of the May 3rd Massacre on Sino-Japanese diplomacy.</p>
<p>Four, The May 3rd Massacre and the International Community</p>
<p>Before the May 3rd Massacre, Japan's attitude towards invading China was superficially to coordinate with the powers, advocating the open door and equal opportunities. However, after the May 3rd incident, it openly abandoned cooperation and adopted an isolated attitude.</p>
<p>The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army aroused the fear of the powers, and foreign warships in China opened fire on the Yangtze River in Nanjing. However, Britain had already compromised with China on the surface, and the United States, due to the lack of concrete political power, not only did not prevent the Chinese revolution but also tried to cooperate with the emerging revolutionary forces. During this naval bombardment, the British and American warships fired blanks, while the Japanese warships were loaded with bullets and fired hard! The United Kingdom and the United States have given a principled recognition of China's tariff autonomy, expressing their goodwill; while Japan has been consistently cunning, without a definite expression. Japan's isolated position is very obvious. The advance into Jinan demonstrated the plight of Japanese imperialism and also demonstrated the dominance and arrogance of the self-proclaimed leader of imperialism. They hoped to gain some exchange benefits by means of demonstration when they later saw that the National Revolution was a strong and powerful movement. We know that Japan's two major enemies, one is Britain and the United States, which are competing with themselves and the capitalist imperialist countries especially the United States, and the other is the socialist country of Soviet Russia. Japan's dispatch of troops was to detect whether there were forces of the two major enemies in the Chinese National Revolution that they thought were involved, or whether it was simply a national revolution. This time they confirmed that the Chinese revolution was a national revolution, and they knew that dealing with the United States was their urgent task, not anti-Russian. However, after the September 18th Incident, Japan seemed hesitant to deal with Russia and the United States because the internal contradictions of imperialism have been deepened since the May 3rd incident.</p>
<p>This is the international significance of May 3rd.</p>
<p>After we understand the historical significance of May 3rd, we should get two lessons:</p>
<p>First, Japan hopes that we will not be unified, and we ourselves are not unified. This is because we do not fight for it ourselves. However, the Chinese people are unified. Many of the internal divisions and struggles in China are the fault of the rulers. Therefore, we feel that the regime cannot be revolutionary if it is divorced from the people.</p>
<p>The second is that China's non-resistance to foreign aggression is also the fault of the rulers. Our people have always advocated and practiced resistance. The uprising of the Northeast Volunteer Army after the September 18th Incident and the enthusiastic support of the people during the January 28th Incident all show that the people have a united determination to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, we feel even more that the regime cannot be revolutionary if it is divorced from the people!</p>
<p>The national humiliation we are commemorating now is not the humiliation of the people, but the humiliation of the government! The people themselves should rise up to seek unity and resistance! To shout for the weak and small nations of the world! To fight for the culture of the world! (Recorded by Ye Wenxiong)</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Our Society Should Pay Attention to the Alarming State of Modern Science</p>
<p>Looking back at China, even pots and stoves are lacking during military operations. Even if there are empty gasoline drums, they are probably used as shelters in trenches and may not be used to steam clothes. The third topic on the fourth day was tropical tumors (cancers, carbuncles, etc.). In addition to explanations of various tumors, lantern slides were used to demonstrate patients with various tumors as evidence. Most of them were collected from Africa and India. Therefore, I feel that there are also many cancer patients in China, but they are hidden in remote areas where there is a lack of medicine and no one to study them. In addition, a film was shown about the division of cancer cells, and the proliferation and division of normal cells in various states. This film was taken in a microscope and is called "attack photography." Because the division of cells is actually not as fast as the movement of bacteria, if we were to photograph it at its natural speed, wouldn't we have to shoot a film that lasts for several hours to see his movements clearly? Therefore, this kind of film is taken in sections of the most active state of cell movement and then connected to become a film. On the screen, it only takes ten minutes to see a cell change from one to two to four. When you usually watch movies, you can see the posture of running horses and the shape of movements. You can use photography to make it a very slow movement, then the very slow process can naturally be turned into a very fast movement by this method of splicing. The situation of cell division, in layman's terms, is simply the state of "how a tumor is formed" or "how flesh grows." These facts can all be brought to our eyes by methods, which can be regarded as true evidence and irrefutable academics. In addition, the state of muscle cells trembling when muscles are subjected to current was also shown, which is also very valuable. Incidentally, the situation of ribbons and eye network membrane diseases was also shown.</p>
<p>The fourth lecture on the fifth day was on the misdiagnosis and treatment of amebic dysentery. It proved that this type of dysentery, if not treated thoroughly, will later develop various symptoms, such as constipation, abdominal pain, liver abscess, mental illness, anemia, etc. At that time, the symptoms are far from dysentery, and doctors often fail to identify it. However, the result is that years of chronic disease can be cured by removing the ameba. However, the method of checking feces to determine whether one has ever suffered from amebic dysentery is very careful. Relying solely on the patient's verbal description is unreliable, because many patients have only had one or two episodes of diarrhea, which is not a symptom of dysentery at all, but the root cause is also ameba.</p>
<p>This topic is very important. We know that in Shanghai and the southern provinces, I don't know how many people suffer from dysentery between summer and autumn every year. How can this kind of dysentery be completely cured? Later (often many years later), other branches and sections of symptoms suddenly arise. One must not think that it is still the dysentery虫 at work. On that day, the lantern slides and films showed the pathological anatomy of the intestinal wall of various dysenteries and the active state of amebas. In addition, the state of hookworms entering the human body was also shown. Approximately, hookworms and human skin come into contact and have reached the subcutaneous tissue to the blood within one minute. You can use alcohol to wipe the skin, and part of it has already penetrated. The trial method is to show it with a domestic rabbit.</p>
<p>The topic on the sixth day was about malaria. Unfortunately, I could not finish listening due to a time conflict. Based on the above simple record, I think the readers should have the following feelings. (1) Modern medicine has already been studied to this point, and it is indeed of origin and has evidence. We must not be complacent and say, "My country's four thousand years of medicine is enough to maintain the health of our nation." (2) People's inventions and equipment are all from advocating science. According to our medical education decline and the weak foundation of science, how can we catch up? (3) In particular, the above-mentioned so-called tropical diseases are the most common and prevalent in most of our southern provinces. I don't know how many people should study and suppress them. One more thing to ask you to pay attention to is that the inventors and researchers mentioned by Europeans who come to Shanghai to lecture are many Japanese, but Chinese names are never heard, which is the most painful.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Bedbug Disease <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Current Condition Report</p>
<p>Bedbugs are also known as bed lice because their bodies have a strange odor, hence the name "bedbugs." They are also called "bed lice" because they hide in the gaps in the bed. The body of a bedbug is round and flat, reddish-brown, about two minutes long, and surrounded by many hairs. It lives in dark places during the day and comes out at night to suck human blood. It appears in early summer. The difference between it and ordinary lice lies in the fact that it is hidden during the day and comes out at night, and only appears in summer throughout the year. At the mention of bedbugs, everyone is afraid, and people have generally experienced their power. Everyone expresses an attitude of "deep hatred" towards them and their presence. But what is beyond our expectation is that the more you don't want to be close to it, the more closely it is close to you, which really makes you feel helpless. Bedbugs have an amazing breeding rate. Their kind is distributed among all mankind, specializing in absorbing the fat and ointment of the people, and all at night when people are sleeping, making people lose their sleep. As for people who are a little fat, that is even better fodder for them, which is exactly in line with their psychology of "choosing the fat and devouring."</p>
<p>The sin of bedbugs is not only in sucking human blood and disturbing people's sleep, but it is actually a poisonous insect. It has the ability to inject poison and spread germs. When bedbugs suck human blood, they have two tasks: (1) absorb external food │ human blood, (2) excrete their own poison. When they inject the poison into the human body, the person being sucked immediately develops small red and swollen bumps at the site of the bite, similar to urticaria, especially on the limbs and face, which make you feel pain and itching. Women and people with delicate skin are most likely to have this symptom after being bitten. In the past half month, no fewer than a dozen people have come to see a doctor because their faces are itchy and swollen, thinking it is urticaria. In fact, where is it urticaria? It is actually poisoned by bedbugs.</p>
<p>The above is just the pain and itchiness that bedbugs give us. It is not their biggest sin. Their biggest sin is spreading germs. According to my personal observations over the past eight or nine years, in Shanghai, there is a disease that is popular every year in April and May. This disease is generally a constant fever that continues until it subsides after five to seven days, (starting with chills, subsiding with sweating) after five to seven │ to the eleventh day, there are chills and fever as before, and the fever subsides after another four or five days. This disease is called (returning heat.) If we take the blood of a person suffering from returning heat and examine it, we can see many spirochetes swimming inside. Where did these bacteria come from? Undoubtedly, they were brought by bedbugs. According to previous observations, it was believed that this bacterium was mediated by lice, so it was one of the "poverty diseases." In fact, lice are available in all seasons. In terms of time, the occurrence of this disease coincides with the appearance of bedbugs, and those who suffer from it are not limited to the poor. Sometimes the upper class also suffers from this disease. Lice are only on the bodies of the poor, while bedbugs are available regardless of wealth or poverty, which further proves that bedbugs have the possibility of carrying bacteria. Because the above two diseases are related to bedbugs, I have no way to name them, so I named them: "Bedbug Disease."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Medicinal Virtue <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Luobai</p>
<p>Medical ethics. Doctor Song Guobin of the Song Dynasty repeatedly spoke of it. We can often see his writings on medical ethics in various newspapers. Nowadays, the number of doctors in Shanghai who uphold morality is increasing daily. Actions such as adding consultation hours for the poor and refusing commissions from pharmacies for dispensing medicine are undoubtedly the result of loud appeals. This is indeed a good phenomenon in the medical field. But what about the pharmaceutical field? It is shameful to speak of. Although there are slogans about authentic medicinal materials in Chinese medicine, in reality, not only are most of them not authentic, but some even use Western medicine to make Chinese medicine pills and powders. What is to become of Chinese medicine? Western medicine is even more diverse and full of strange things. Some sell fake goods as genuine products, and some sell inferior goods as superior products. Some sell domestic goods as foreign goods, and some sell foreign goods as domestic goods. Some skimp on ingredients, and others use substitutes. Some even beautifully call it "ancient formula, newly made," using Buddhist teachings to sell their wild man's head. They only recognize profit, and do not consider harming people. This trend has recently become even more downward. Although the government at the time had regulations for managing pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical merchants once opposed these regulations. However, what they opposed was not the regulations themselves, but aspects of the regulations that did not conform to scientific principles and market conditions. They requested modifications. To this day, it has been shelved for three years. Not only has the management not been implemented, but there has not even been a written response. As a result, generally ambiguous pharmaceutical merchants spare no effort in using inhumane techniques to exploit the nation's interests. Therefore, the lack of cultivating medicinal virtue can be said to be extreme. No wonder foreign pharmaceutical merchants in Shanghai, citing the corruption of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, have established an "International Pharmaceutical Association." Their stated responsibility is to guide the manufacture of Chinese medicines and improve the development of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. Alas, what a painful situation! Could it be that before the nation is jointly managed by the international community, the field of pharmacy will be subjected to their control first? Although there are not many pharmacists in our country, there are no fewer than several dozen who practice in Shanghai. Together with the certified pharmacy assistants, there could be more than a hundred people. Why haven't we heard from them? Why not set aside differences, unite as one, join the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, promote medicinal virtue, seek the construction of pharmacy for the country, and seek the development of pharmacy for society. If there are those who do not uphold morality, whether they are national organizations or private businesses, we can all rise up and attack them. Because the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association is a national academic organization. If it can unite as one, its strength will be greater, and medicinal virtue will be easier to promote. Before there are publicly observed regulations on medicinal virtue, according to my personal opinion, we must first adhere to the four words: "precise," "accurate," "pure," and "clean." These are described in detail as follows. What is meant by "precise"? The products must be precise. It does not mean that only my products are precise, but that I do my best with my knowledge and abilities to produce them. Do not produce crudely and carelessly. For example, when making malt extract or cod liver oil, do not destroy the digestive enzymes in the malt extract, nor the Vitamin A in the cod liver oil. Even more so, do not add MSG and falsely claim it as vitamins. There are many malt extracts and cod liver oils produced in China today, but</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>how many of them retain the digestive enzymes and vitamins without loss? Also, take the sugar coating of tablets as an example. Chinese products mostly follow the method of making sweets, and are easily deliquescent. How many companies manufacture according to pharmaceutical standards, so that they can be stored for a long time without becoming damp? How many pharmaceutical preparations can be manufactured according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia? These are what should be paid attention to in the word "precise." What is meant by "accurate"? The dosage must be accurate. Do not dilute two pounds of tincture of opium to make three pounds. Do not make one-grain quinine tablets and falsely claim they are two grains. Because if a doctor uses this medicine with a small dosage and it is ultimately ineffective, they will naturally increase the dosage. Or, if they use an accurate dosage, they will use it in the same way as an inaccurate dosage. As a result, the patient's body is overdosed and poisoned. Is this not harmful? Therefore, weighing medicine should be accurate, preparing medicines should follow the pharmacopoeia, and compounding prescriptions should follow the prescriptions. These are what should be paid attention to in the word "accurate." What is meant by "pure"? The raw materials must be pure. It is not only that the cod liver oil sold to the Bureau of Taxation is adulterated with vegetable oil, that the Cuban cigar is mixed with potassium bromide, or that the East sandalwood oil is mixed with West sandalwood oil that can be called impure. All those that do not meet the content specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia can be regarded as impure medicines. However,</p>
<p>how many medical clinics in Shanghai today have laboratory facilities? Therefore, I often propose in the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association that the association should set up a laboratory so that shipments can be sent for analysis upon arrival, so that it can be known whether they are pure or not. Recently, there have also been discoveries of foreign merchants selling fake medicines, and this can also prevent deception. These are what should be paid attention to in the word "pure."</p>
<p>What is meant by "clean"? The handling must be clean. It is not only when chicken droppings are mixed in chicken broth or mud is mixed in syrup that it can be called unclean. All hands during manufacturing, containers for storing medicines, and machines for making medicines that have not been properly disinfected can be considered unclean. However, how many clean Chinese pharmaceutical factories are there? And among them, even fewer use scientific methods for manufacturing. Therefore, domestic pharmaceutical products are often criticized for incomplete disinfection. These are what should be paid attention to in the word "clean." Alas, the nation is in distress, and people's livelihoods are urgent. As members of the pharmaceutical community, how can we shirk our responsibility? Why not quickly rise up and promote medicinal virtue to enhance the personality of pharmacists, to increase faith in medicines, to complete the equipment of pharmaceutical factories, and to improve the quality of medicines. In this way, it may not be a way to save the country. It is hoped that the people will have a proper understanding of medicines, and that those people of Korean descent, Japanese nationality, claiming to be American merchants, buying German medicines, these four unidentifiable people cannot run rampant in our Chinese territory. Then the pharmaceutical industry will be fortunate.</p>

<p>(E) Postpartum Fever</p>
<p>A relatively common and important disease related to reproductive function during the postpartum period is puerperal fever. This disease is caused by infection through wounds in the reproductive organs. During the postpartum period, a woman is like someone with a serious injury, so she is susceptible to infection through wounds. In particular, traditional midwives completely disregard disinfection during childbirth. Even if the delivery is smooth, the uncleanliness of their fingers and tools often predisposes the mother to the risk of puerperal fever during the postpartum period. Severe puerperal fever, even if not fatal, will leave her moaning in bed for months. In short, puerperal fever is a traumatic fever caused entirely by the toxic effects of bacteria parasitic on damaged parts of the reproductive organs. These bacteria contain potent toxins for the human body. When they infect the bloodstream, systemic symptoms occur. If vital organs are affected, death is inevitable. Among traditional midwives, some know that when the perineum is tough and about to obstruct the baby's head, they will use their filthy fingernails to cruelly puncture the perineum and labia. This is the easiest way to transmit infection and is the most frightening thing. There is also a type of midwife who habitually uses iron hooks and other objects full of bacteria to recklessly perform so-called major surgery, often causing the deaths of both mother and child. This is also the result of wound infection. They die before they even develop puerperal fever. Therefore, disinfecting fingers and tools during childbirth is the most important task. How can traditional midwives understand this reason? So they often harm people's lives. The most important method for preventing puerperal fever is to clean the reproductive organs thoroughly. All medical instruments must be strictly disinfected to minimize the spread of viruses. If uterine contraction is weak after childbirth, ergot preparations should be administered to promote uterine contraction and avoid the danger of bleeding. Ice packs can be applied to relieve uterine pain. Large doses of ergot preparations should also be administered at the onset of the disease. In short, prevention methods that are castles in the air cannot be achieved. If you want to fundamentally solve the problem, nothing is better than maintaining the body's resistance, which is to promote excretion and improve nutrition. The method of caring for women suffering from the disease during the postpartum period is also important. First, the patient must be placed in a comfortable position. Second, the body must be kept clean and contamination of clothing and bedding must be prevented. Special attention should be paid to the air and light in the sickroom and the warmth of the patient. Do not be negligent in the slightest.  )Already(Normal Body Temperature</p>
<p>In the normal postpartum process, there is usually no fever. Although the body temperature is slightly higher immediately after delivery, it can return to normal within 24 hours. If the body temperature rises above 38 degrees during the postpartum period, it should be considered a pathological fever. However, an increase in body temperature on the first or second day or the third to fifth day after delivery cannot be generalized. The body temperature during the second week of the postpartum period is two to three tenths higher than usual. The change within a day is also no more than five tenths. Otherwise, it is pathological. What should also be noted is that the body temperature during the postpartum period is very sensitive. Fever is often possible due to extremely minor obstacles or emotional disturbances. Immediately after delivery, the pulse rate increases slightly and the body temperature decreases. The pulse rate also decreases. After three to five days, it drops to sixty beats, or even below forty beats. This reduction is a normal phenomenon. During the first week of the postpartum period, women are prone to sweating during sleep. This is generally due to drinking more fluids, keeping the body warm, or the labor of breastfeeding, and is not unusual. Women often experience chills during or after delivery. This is also within the physiological range. It is generally due to the body's exposure during delivery and the reaction to the loss of heat during the expulsion of the fetus, and should not be regarded as a pathological effect.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(7) Acute Bronchitis</p>
<p>(Commonly known as severe cold cough)</p>
<p>Q: What is acute bronchitis? A: It is what is commonly called a severe cold cough, or Acute bronchitis in Western medicine. Q: How does this disease start?</p>
<p>A: Because there are usually various bacteria attached to our airways, when the weather is abnormal, suddenly cold and hot, the body's internal resistance to these bacteria decreases, and then a cold occurs, causing acute inflammation of the bronchi. This is the most common cause, but it can also be caused by chemical irritants or dust being inhaled into the airways. Q: Are there any other causes? A: Yes, many infectious diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, influenza, and whooping cough also cause bronchitis. Q: Is there a relationship between bronchitis and age and physique? A: In terms of age, children and the elderly are more likely to get the disease, and physique is also very important. People who are prone to catching colds are prone to bronchitis. Such people feel very terrible in autumn and winter, often for as long as half a year, and some turn into chronic bronchitis. Q: What are the symptoms of acute bronchitis? A: General fatigue, often with headaches, and rhinitis and hoarseness. At first, there is a dry, prickly cough with a tickling sensation in the throat and trachea, like a feeling of injury. Coughing is stronger when inhaling cold air, smoke, or dust, and there is often a slight increase in body temperature and difficulty breathing. Q: Is there any phlegm coughed up? A: A small amount of phlegm is coughed up in the early stages, which is transparent and mucous. From the third day of the illness, the amount increases and becomes opaque, looking very waxy. Q: Does the body have a fever with this disease? A: There is usually no fever, but children often have a moderate increase in body temperature. Q: What changes are there in the lung auscultation? A: When there is a small amount of secretion, dry rales or creaking sounds are heard during inhalation. When there is a large amount of secretion, moist rales are heard. Q: Is the course of acute bronchitis good? A: Most are good, but it also depends on the patient's physique and the health of the lungs. Bronchitis after influenza is often very dangerous. It also feels dangerous for elderly, weak people, those with heart disease, those with kyphosis, or those who already have lung disease.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment method? A: First, have the patient rest and make them sweat, give them some hot drinks, take antipyretics or other antipyretics, and add cardiotonics. Keep the room at a suitable temperature and humidity. Apply a moist warm cloth to the patient's chest, or apply heated anti-inflammatory and analgesic ointment. Q: What should be done when there is difficulty breathing? A: Mustard plasters can be applied to the chest. Severe cases can be treated with mustard plastering, which is very effective. It is better for children to use 20 cm of mustard in a cloth bag and put it in the bath water for a warm bath.</p>
<p>Q: What medications should be taken internally? A: If it is not easy to cough up phlegm, expectorants can be taken, such as ipecac infusion, polygala infusion, fennel essence, almond water, ammonium chloride, etc. These drugs should be selected by a doctor in moderation.</p>
<p>Q: What medicine can be used to stop coughing when the cough is severe? A: Cough medicines are nothing more than some medicines that reduce the excitement of the respiratory center. Ordinary people should not take them indiscriminately, and children should pay extra attention.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a bacterial suspension injection to prevent bronchitis? A: Yes, the bacterial suspensions used to prevent bronchitis are now all catarrhal mixed bacterial suspensions (CATARRHALVACCUN. OCOMBINED). It should be injected three or four times, the first injection is 0.2 cubic centimeters, the second is 0.4 cubic</p>
<p>centimeters, the third is 0.8 cubic centimeters, and the fourth is 1.0 cubic centimeters. Q: How long can the preventive injection prevent this disease? A: It can prevent the disease for about four to five months.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Leprosy Common Sense Everyone Should Have Chinese Leprosy Relief Association <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Mingqiang</p>
<p>Leprosy is the most cruel disease, and every country in the world has it. Now I will describe the general common sense of this disease as follows. I think it will be enjoyed by readers. 1. Name Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease. The ancient names of our country, such as Feng, Tumor, Great Wind, Heavenly Punishment, and Malignant Disease, are all other names for this disease. It was not until modern times that it was called Great Leprosy or Leprosy. 2. Pathogen The cause of leprosy is the reproduction of a type of microscopic bacterium called bacillus. This bacillus often parasitizes in the skin and nerves of the human body. It was discovered by Dr. Norway Hansen in 1874, so it is named Hansen's bacillus or simply leprosy or bacillus. 3. Symptoms The initial symptoms are red or white spots on the skin, with a darker red border around them. The sensation on the spots is not as sensitive as other parts, or even numb, and there is no sweating. These spots are first discovered on the limbs and gradually spread throughout the body. Another common sign is that the veins on the skin become thicker and feel painful when touched. As the disease worsens, the fingers and toes rot off, the joints become stiff and cannot be bent, the muscles atrophy, the spots ulcerate, the face becomes swollen, and the eyebrows fall off, resembling a sleeping lion, which is disgusting. 4. Transmission Although the route of leprosy transmission is not very clear at present, it is most easily transmitted through long-term and close contact between ordinary people and those with the disease, such as living in the same room, sharing utensils, sleeping together, and eating together with leprosy patients. The common saying that seeing a leper or touching a leper's body can transmit the disease is an exaggeration and is not credible. 5. Treatment There are now symptomatic drugs for treating leprosy, but treatment requires a long period of time to be effective. According to our experience, even the mildest cases require several months or more than half a year of effective treatment before the symptoms can disappear. As for the drugs used, chaulmoogra oil and various preparations of this oil are the first choice. Common methods of use include injection and oral administration. Although the oral procedure is simple, the effect is not as obvious as injection.</p>
<p>6. Prevention Increasing the body's resistance is the fundamental way to prevent leprosy. Special attention should be paid to things such as adequate nutrition, proper exercise, avoiding overwork, and skin cleanliness. If the above-mentioned symptoms are found, a reliable doctor should be consulted for diagnosis. Other precautions include: 1. Avoiding long-term and close contact with patients. 2. Leprosy patients should live in separate rooms and their utensils and clothes should not be mixed with those of ordinary people. If the poor and sick cannot implement the above rules, the only option is to guide them into leprosy hospitals for isolation. 3. Patients must not marry before being proven completely cured by a doctor. 4. The nasal secretions and skin ulcers and pus of patients contain bacilli and should be destroyed. 5. The children of patients must be separated from their parents with the disease immediately after birth. 6. In leprosy-endemic areas, when hiring wet nurses and servants, if there is suspicion, a specialist doctor should be asked to examine whether they have the disease.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued instructions to the Anhui Education Department, saying, "We have received your submission. In order to avoid having the examinees wait for the results and save on travel expenses, the Department should promptly grade the examination papers after holding the high school graduation exam, and hold re-examinations after announcing the results. The re-examination is a method of assisting students who fail one or two subjects, and should not be postponed until the next exam. Students who still fail one or two subjects in the re-examination should be instructed to take remedial classes in accordance with Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations on High School Graduation Examinations, and should be allowed to participate in the next examination. If the junior high school students still fail the re-examination, they can take the entrance examination as students with equivalent qualifications, but they cannot take the examination with graduation qualifications. High school students must not take the university entrance examination without graduation qualifications. The Department should follow these instructions."</p>

<p>Result Two to One</p>
<p>Sun Sijing is Still Well</p>
<p>The Donghua football team, which is about to depart for the Philippines, played a match against the Navy yesterday. Representatives from the HMS Kent also participated. The scorching sun shone brightly, as if it were early summer. The five thousand spectators in attendance were covered in sweat, and the twenty-two players on the field were panting heavily. The result was two to one, with Donghua winning. The referee was Li Silian.</p>
<p>Equal Strength of Opponents Sun Sijing, who had been away for a long time, suddenly appeared on the field yesterday, attracting much attention from the audience. Mr. Sun still held a key position in the center, providing support and assistance at the right time. Donghua's prospects before departing for the Philippines are increasingly optimistic with the addition of this strong veteran. Qian Jingyong and Cao Qiuting had been away from the game for a long time but played well. After the match, all the players were able to demonstrate their true abilities. The Kent team is a top-tier team with overall strength, especially on the flanks. Otherwise, the score difference would not have been so close.</p>
<p>Equal Autumn Colors The fierce battle began. As soon as Custer passed the ball to Green, Sun Sijing intercepted the path horizontally. Li Yichen's counterattack failed, and Hong Guang was caught offside. Wan Xianghua's three northern expeditions were all unsuccessful. Wu Youliang, who had not been on the field for long, suddenly announced his withdrawal, and Feng Yunyou was brought in to fill the vacancy. Guan Xun'an stepped up to the plate and battled back and forth for thirty minutes. The Donghua team was exhausted, and with a slight negligence, Fling led his troops deep into the penalty area and passed to Hayes. With the defense vacant, the first goal was scored. The entire Donghua army sighed, and several counterattacks were ineffective. Finally, Wan's western expedition launched an attack. Su Bing was unable to block it, and the gate was opened. Bram risked his life to intercept, and Wan assigned Yichen to intercept him nearby, kicking the ball straight into the net, creating equal autumn colors. After a period of melee, the break arrived.</p>
<p>Home Ball Succeeds At the start of the second half, the Kent team all wore sports vests and played bare-armed, which was quite unique. After much maneuvering, Qian Jingyong received a home ball pass and shot straight down like a flight, kicking it obliquely into the goal. Unexpectedly, it was ruled offside, and the fans were greatly disappointed. After this, Li Yichen miscalculated twice, and the home ball further messed things up, wasting a lot of good time. Sun Sijing was very anxious and intercepted a ball in the center back, passing it to Wan to penetrate the heavy defense. One cross pass was received by the home ball, and a small trial of strength actually worked wonders, causing Lang Lai to stare blankly, not knowing what to do. Donghua then took a two-to-one lead. Custer was furious and led his troops to advance step by step. Mertes broke past Guan and sent the ball to the center. Green sent the ball into the net within the penalty line. Lu Dameng was lured out, and Dr. Tu met him with his hand. Li Silian considered it offside, and it became a bubble. Donghua attacked several times, but failed to achieve anything. Before long, the sound of the gong signaled the end of the battle.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Two Relay Races</p>
<p>Both Defeated Central University</p>
<p>1600 Meters Breaks Jiangnan University Record</p>
<p>Guanghua University has 99% of the all-around championship in hand. In yesterday's five events, Guanghua and their strong opponent Central University each scored six points. In the ten events, Guanghua's Wang Jihuai can score at least six points, equal to Central University. Moreover, Central University lost to Guanghua in both the 1500-meter and 1600-meter relay races yesterday. The only remaining event is the 400-meter relay race. The relay race results yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>1600 Meters In the 1600-meter race, each person runs 400 meters. It was easy for Jiaotong to defeat Central University with their balanced talent. In the first leg, Guanghua's Tao Yingjie was ahead, Jiaotong was second, Ma Yu of Central University was third, and Liu Yibi of Jinan was last. In the second leg, Guanghua's Zhan Yiji was still in the lead, Jiaotong was second, Central University was third, and Jinan was even further behind. In the third leg, Central University's Jiang Liangui broke through Jiaotong's Gu Guangfu and competed with Guanghua. By the start of the fourth leg, Central University had caught up to Guanghua. In the fourth leg, Guanghua's general Dong Shuzhao took the lead, Central University's Hu Shixuan and Jiaotong's Liu Fukang followed. Dong went ahead, and Liu approached and chased Hu, getting closer and closer, but Liu was still more than ten meters behind at the finish line. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>1st Guanghua University 2nd Central University</p>
<p>3rd Jiaotong University 4th Jinan University</p>
<p>Result: 3 minutes 50 seconds (breaks Jiangnan University record)</p>
<p>1500 Meters In the 1500-meter race, the first leg is 100 meters, the second leg is 200 meters, the third leg is 400 meters, and the last leg is 800 meters. The competition between Guanghua and Central University was as fierce as the 1600-meter race. In the first leg, Central University's Lu Yu was in the lead, Wu Dasheng of Guanghua was second, Xu Xizuan of Jiaotong was next, and Guo Liulin of Jinan was last. In the last ten meters of the second leg (200 meters), Guanghua overtook Central University again. The Guanghua player was the general Wang Jihuai, the Central University player was Ma Yu, the Jiaotong player was Zheng Wen, and the Jinan player was Wu Rongquan. In the third leg (400 meters), Central University overtook Guanghua again. The Guanghua player was Tao Yingjie, the Central University player was Tian Hanxiang, the Jiaotong player was Wu Chu, and the Jinan player was Li Yaolong. In the last leg (800 meters), the Guanghua player was again the general Dong Shuzhao, the Central University player was Hu Shixuan, the Jiaotong player was Liu Fukang, and the Jinan player was Chen Guangjing. Dong went ahead early, and Liu chased Hu, but unfortunately failed by a shoulder at the finish line. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>1st Guanghua University 2nd Central University</p>
<p>3rd Jiaotong University 4th Jinan University</p>
<p>Result: 3 minutes 43 seconds and 53/5 seconds</p>

<p>In the women's 200-meter relay race, each person</p>
<p>ran 50 meters. Jinan temporarily did not participate. However, because the Central University race was related to the creation of a result, they still started. In the first leg, Hu Ruisheng was very fast, but when the second leg player Liu Guanglin and the third leg player Chen Qing passed the baton, their technique was not skilled, and the baton fell to the ground. They picked it up and ran again. The fourth leg player Zhou Yueying was fast but ineffective. The referee ruled it a foul and canceled the result.</p>
<p>Women's Javelin Throw 1st place went to Wu Houbai from Central University (Xu Tianzhang)</p>

<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>"Seeking," in the world, no matter what it is, anything that has to do with the word "seeking" is always a little difficult.</p>
<p>"Seeking a person," even if you write the word "person" upside down, with feet in the air, even if you "prepare funds and wait, and will never break your word," but carrying a foot warmer lid, from the North Market to the South Market, "the person is still nowhere to be found." "Seeking business," "seeking money," "seeking food," is even more difficult. Even if you put on a smiling face, calling "Sir" and "Uncle," "for the sake of my late father," or say it even more pitifully, "save my family," even shedding two lines of tears after the smiling face, still, "I can't help you," "I'll keep it in mind," and that's it. "Seeking a house" is also like this. Your two feet are sore from walking, as if after an 800-mile marathon race, you finally found a house that suits your taste, but "no families allowed," "no children allowed," it's really difficult. "Seeking flowers and asking willows" seems as easy as turning your hand. The streets are full of "flowers" waiting to be "sought." As long as you are willing to raise your hand, why worry about not finding one? However, remembering the "No Urinating" sign at the entrance of the alley, and the "Guaranteed Cure for Gonorrhea and Leukorrhea" advertisement you saw while urinating, you can't help but hesitate in the face of beauty. "Seeking a helpmate," even if you compromise and only require "clean background, decent appearance, basic literacy, regardless of wealth," but after posting a classified ad like a dried tofu for three days, the applicants are either old women or have pockmarked faces, missing teeth, are blind or mute, and you don't dare to accept. "Seeking happiness" is also not easy. Talking and laughing with friends, if it gets stiff, it can lead to quarrels and fights. Seeing someone likable on the street, even if you are old and experienced, if you "use flattering words" improperly, you will surely get a big slap on your face. I seek and seek, but I can never find something easy. One day, I heard a friend say, "The Huangpu River has no lid."</p>
<p>Then I realized, "The easiest thing in the world is to seek death." However, those who try to drown themselves are rescued by the police, and those who take poison are sent to the hospital for treatment. So, "seeking death" is also difficult.</p>

<p>Dressed in a cloak of emerald green, the rural area in May sleeps quietly! Under that warm sunlight, the mulberry trees on the slope have leaves that are as big as palms. A gentle breeze blows through the unripe wheat field, and the wheat ears stir up a wave of green. A farmer carries a basket of grains in one hand and grabs handfuls of grains from the basket, scattering them on the field that has been leveled into several squares. Another farmer is still urging a strong cow, turning the soil in the field with primitive plowing. He occasionally raises his head to look at the neighboring fields: some are sowing seeds, while others have already sprouted several inches of green seedlings. An anxious expression is revealed on his face, and the sound of urging the cow becomes louder and heavier in the quiet space!</p>
<p>A shepherd boy lies on the back of a cow, coming out of the distant tea mountain. He is reminiscing about the "Sangjian Pusang" romances of the past, while singing a mountain song: "Tea-picking girl, flower-picking boy..." The voice is so long and intoxicated, as if trying his best to pull himself back into those sweet memories! "Chicken feathers, rags for sugar!" Shouting, shaking the iron sheet to make a clanging sound. A ragged sugar seller carrying two bamboo baskets passes by the front of the village. Upon hearing this sound, the village women hurriedly run out of their houses, carrying rolls of rags or chicken feathers in their hands. Children follow in groups, drooling and waiting for the sugar to be exchanged. An old, molting dog, curled up in the corner of the house, suddenly rushes out, barking wildly at the ragged stranger with its two bright eyes, "Woof! Woof! Woof!"</p>
<p>A group of ducks are swimming and quacking in a pond! The duck herder, dragging a long bamboo pole, is enjoying the scenery on his own.</p>
<p>Two farmers, having sold their full baskets of cabbage, and exchanged them for some cloth and sundries, are returning from the town, sweating. As they enter the village entrance, they see a woman with disheveled hair standing in front of their house; she is undoubtedly their wife waiting.</p>
<p>A rooster puffs up its wings and stretches its neck to crow: "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" White smoke rises in wisps from the tops of those houses.</p>
<p>A cuckoo calls from the distant dense forest, "Silly Brother! Silly Brother!" Frogs are angry in the field, bulging their round eyes: "Bad! Bad! Bad!"...</p>
<p>The rural area in May sleeps quietly, quietly.</p>

<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, Tiehua and I stepped into a small wine shop on Gongguan Road. On the street, we saw several shops shouting loudly with big discounts and sales, but there were few customers. Some stood outside the glass windows for a while and then left. Here, you can also see that the city's economy is gradually collapsing, and the prosperity is already showing signs of fatigue, causing the transformation of the era to fall into an inevitable fate. Two young companions who have been struggling hard in the city for several years cannot suppress the sorrow buried in their hearts, and often use bitter wine to numb themselves. They know that drowning sorrows with wine is useless, but we cannot help but use a glass of wine to forget the immeasurable sins, partings, joys, and sorrows of the world for a moment. Outsiders will think it's complaining, but the feelings of those involved are really hard to describe and will not be understood. Slightly drunk, we left the wine shop and walked into Avenue Joffre in the bright streetlights. Avenue Joffre, with its exotic scenery, is filled with joy and laughter, but also with sadness and sorrow. These two different flavors must be carefully experienced by those who walk on Avenue Joffre. At the intersection of Rue Lupan, we saw the New Hawaii Cafe, so we went in with an interest we had never had before. Pushing open the two small doors revealed dim lights, and two Russian waiters greeted us very politely. We went in and chose a seat, ordered two cups of coffee. The small cafe was well decorated. Inside was a music stage. It was still early, and there were not many customers. The music started, and the reddish light, set against the green ceiling, had a special charm. The murals also became colorful. The sad melody filled us with melancholy.</p>
<p>Just as the music stopped, a Russian woman came in. She was old, but still wore rouge and powder, showing off the style of her youth, which made her look ugly. Youth is worth cherishing and being proud of. Perhaps this woman was a noble lady in her youth, beautifully dressed, enjoying luxury, and acting arrogantly, making young men and wealthy young masters adore her. Now everything is over. Everything before is like a decaying dream. Her decaying body and decaying soul are drifting in a foreign land, being trampled on to earn a living. Oh, how pitiful! Finally, after sitting for a while, we left during the music again. The woman was talking to a middle-aged man who seemed to be a date in the shadows of the palm trees. We parted in the night, feeling lost.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Scene, Cold Observation of Two Sides, Rugged World, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>Guizhi still looked at those bowls, seemingly unconcerned, and said: Whether it's a pretense or not, how would I know? But no one is forcing anyone, so what's the point of pretending? For the past six months, you've been saying this and that to me, so I believe you. Is it possible that people don't have daughters to give away? As she spoke, her expression darkened a bit. Jizhi said: Don't be angry, listen to me. Now the world is rugged, and no one knows what will happen tomorrow. I don't know how long I'll be able to do this job, I'm not sure yet, so I'm asking you to wait three years. Guizhi suddenly raised her voice and said: That's it. You know the world is rugged and you're not sure; why are you asking me to wait three years? These few words left Jizhi speechless. He was silent for a long time before lowering his voice and saying: You need to know that my three-year deadline has a meaning. If I can do this job for three years, I can save as much as possible each month, which would be fifty yuan more, six hundred a year, and two thousand in three years. Then I'll have a way. If I can't do it for three years, cut it in half, and I can still save a thousand yuan. At that time, having some capital in hand will make it easier to find a way out and be bolder. With money, everything is easier. If you ask me to agree to a shorter period now, and I can't do it when the time comes, wouldn't that be worse? That's why I'm making the date longer. If I find a way out in a year and a half, then of course we'll get together within a year and a half, so there's no need for three years. Guizhi blushed and said: You misunderstood me. I'm not talking about the timing, I'm worried that something will change over time. First of all, there's my mother. She's not so easy to talk to, she won't let me say whatever I want. When that time comes, if she wants me to do something, can I not do it? Jizhi listened and looked at her with a smile. After a while, he said: What do you mean by "do something"? Guizhi smiled and said: We're talking seriously, why are you joking again? Jizhi said: It's not that I like to joke, it's just that your words are a source of jokes, so I just said a few words.

<p>Youth cannot be retained, the fragrance of young grape flowers has passed, the May breeze carries the strings of the city, stirring the emotions of young men and women; making them float away in a drunken dream: looking at the sky, tears are rippling in the clouds, silently speechless.</p>
<p>In front of the red light, the sea of people swept away the spring hearts of the masses. In the department store and on the radio, endless sounds of national subjugation are pouring out. People are intoxicated by clothes, candies, cosmetics, perfumes, and silk stockings, unable to open their eyes like a nodding beetle, and thinking about tomorrow. The wind of Venus blows from Sullivan to Marseille, and then floats from the neon lights of the amusement park, over the laughter of the movie theater. The blood-soaked sad songs of vagrants and newsboys on the street corners are floating. The jade skin of modern girls is flaunting. The Ah Q of the times stares with wide eyes, fantasizing about the splendor of cherry blossom women. At the entrance of the pharmacy, full of spring, young wives and unmarried ladies carry a big bag of "her friend" contraceptives, coming out triumphantly. Next to the small Austin stands a anti-Japanese national salvationist, pulling others by the ear and whispering: Contraception saves the country, thank God, may the masses no longer give birth to those reserve slaves of national subjugation! Suddenly, a Japanese military vehicle full of invaders tramples over everyone's heads and drives away. The numb drunkards lower their heads almost to the ground, but soon return to normal, cursing happily! Ah! Victory, victory! The third victory of non-resistance! The urban wind is smiling humorously at the people of May!</p>

<p>— Peiying</p>
<p>When your children are sick, there is a family, and there cannot be no children. When there are children, it is inevitable that they will get sick. To prevent children from getting sick, the first thing is to make them have a strong body and strong resistance to maintain permanent health. However, children are not fully developed, and it is difficult to obtain strong resistance. Therefore, weakness, insomnia, colds, teething fever, night terrors, etc., are common difficulties for children. However, we know very clearly that paying more attention to children's health can increase the chances of avoiding illness. If mothers can examine their children on a regular basis like doctors, they will definitely get good results. The most obvious effect is that diseases transmitted from companions can be avoided, which are usually not very careful or attentive. Now, because they are discovered through examinations, they can be avoided. In the past, we believed that children would take whatever they saw, and that getting sick was inevitable. Now we know that preventing infection not only requires them to develop a natural resistance, but also to avoid a disease attack in advance. For example, there are good methods such as blood serum or vaccination to defend against scarlet fever, scarlet fever, and smallpox. However, we should not think that infectious diseases are terrible and that other diseases can be ignored, which is not the case. All diseases are terrible and have dangers. As for creating a strong body and strong resistance, rely on the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) The timing of meals should be correctly specified, and the amount of food should be appropriate and average; such as fats, proteins, starches (carbohydrates), liquids, and various vitamins; that is, mineral salts and green pigments such as vegetables, etc., should also be matched, because this food is needed for body growth. (2) Develop a regular habit of excretion, muscle development, energy conservation, and physical fitness. (3) Live in fresh air and sunlight for several hours every day. The clothes worn by children should be kept warm for the hands and feet. (4) Have adequate sleep in a well-ventilated room with good air. (5) Conduct regular health checks, including blood tests, detailed examinations, and confirmation that there is no blood deficiency. Test urine and stool, and explore the abdomen's breath, which is prone to self-poisoning. No matter what kind of illness a child has, the earliest symptoms are almost the same. These symptoms are nothing more than problems with the respiratory system, such as sneezing, nasal discharge, such as nasal mucus, difficulty breathing, and sore throat; or there are more severe symptoms, such as wheezing and coughing in the chest. Fever may also arise from these symptoms. But one thing can be relieved is that from the throat to the ear tube, if it is also involved, causing an irregular high fever, thus restlessness and disturbing sleep, then for the child's ears, there is no need to directly pay attention, because they are young and will not hurt. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be found at the beginning of any disease, and they are very confusing, because this disease is easy to ignore, and it is not clear for a while what kind of disease it is. There are many phenomena, which are not easy to determine. Some have poor appetite and cannot eat anything, some have vomiting, some have diarrhea, and some have severe constipation. Any kind of phenomenon is enough to cause gastrointestinal disease. There are many mothers who do not understand the principle that children should sleep peacefully when they are sick, thinking that the sick child is already very distressed and should be taught to be happy, playing with toys, crawling on the floor, and even letting him do whatever he wants. They do not know that the reason why children should be made to sleep peacefully when they are attacked by illness is probably for three reasons. First, to preserve his activity and recovery ability, so as to increase the opportunity to restore energy naturally. Second, to prevent the body from catching a cold due to the harmonization of different air in the room, and to avoid the fatigue of the sick child's hyperthermia. Third, avoid fatigue, because fatigue itself is harmful to health. Sleeping peacefully in bed should give up all happy memories and thoughts. At this time, mothers should prepare more things to accompany them, such as beautiful bedding, brightly colored pajamas, exquisite small tables, glass bottles, etc., to induce children's joy and be willing to live quietly in bed. Put a pot of flowers on the shelf, and prepare some good-looking and delicious food, so that children will be happy when they see it, and on the other hand, they will be willing to eat it. The above words are just for reference, not to say that if a child gets sick, it is not necessary to ask a doctor, but to help before asking a doctor, and to preserve the child's vitality so that he can recover faster.</p>

<p>The main ingredient of "Everyday Clear" tablets is domestic rhubarb. According to rhubarb, its nature is quick, promoting metabolism and generating new energy, like quelling chaos to achieve peace, so it has the title of "General." Shennong Materia Medica has recognized it as a good medicine for constipation. Emperor Binzong of Jin Dynasty boiled rhubarb into ointment and pills, and taking it had miraculous effects, so he was given the name "Bao'an Pill." This has been repeatedly tested and proven by hundreds of millions of doctors in our country for thousands of years without any error. Therefore, the importance of rhubarb in Chinese medicine is almost equal to that of ginseng. There is a comment that "Ginseng is a good minister for governing the world, and rhubarb is a good general for stabilizing the world." Thus, the reputation of Chinese rhubarb has spread at home and abroad. After the opening of the sea ban, it began to be shipped from Shanghai to European and American countries. Western medical circles saw that rhubarb had both stomach-invigorating and laxative functions, which were superior to any Western medicine, so they competed to study the transplant of rhubarb, hoping to transform it into a specialty of their own countries. However, the rhubarb transplanted in European and American countries and Japan differs greatly from Chinese rhubarb in terms of shape, color, aroma, and efficacy due to differences in geology and climate. Therefore, the current Japanese government pharmacopoeia contains the praise that "Chinese rhubarb is the most ideal constipation medicine compared to any domestic product." British rhubarb products are generally coated with Chinese rhubarb powder to decorate the surface and sell in European and American markets. From this, it can be imagined that the status of Chinese rhubarb in the world is honorable. Our factory uses scientific methods to extract the essence of domestic rhubarb as the main ingredient of this medicine. Its nature is peaceful and has no side effects. For habitual constipation, continuous use can achieve the same continuous effect, and those suffering from hemorrhoids can take it, so that the stool is very soft and does not compress the affected area, so it has the wonderful effect of helping natural healing.

<h3 id="e174">Self-Reliance and External Force <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>It seems that in Buddhist meditation, there are two types: self-awakening and assisted awakening by external forces. However, what is prevalent in China now is entirely the ideology of relying on external forces. The well-known fact that a certain president seeks gods and worships Buddha, hoping that Bodhisattvas will come to China, need not be mentioned. Even a certain committee member's five-year plan of waiting for Japan to destroy itself is a manifestation of the meditative mind that relies on external forces. Recently, a certain minister brought good news from abroad, saying that if the enemy attacks Peiping and Tientsin, the United States will definitely intervene, so we should lure the enemy deep into our territory! All of these are examples of Chinese people's optimistic thinking based on reliance on external forces. To put it nicely, it is a diplomatic policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians." To put it bluntly, it is a convenient mentality of being lazy, enjoying misfortune, using others as a tool, and governing by doing nothing.</p>
<p>However, while the principles of Heaven are inevitable, human affairs are uncertain. In a Russian novel, there is a coffin maker who, seeing that a seriously ill rich man next door was sure to die, secretly measured his size and made a coffin, waiting to sell it at a high price. However, the rich man's condition improved and he went to a foreign hot spring for treatment, where he eventually died. Isn't our anger at Russia for selling out the Middle East Railway and not coming to fight the Japanese for us the same as the coffin maker's anger? In the past, the declining gentlemen still had the backing of the League of Nations. Therefore, when the enemy slapped my left cheek, I offered my right cheek, saying that we were a gentleman's country that abided by the League's covenants and that etiquette required it. Now, after losing Jehol and surrendering Doolon three times, we have probably reached the point of taking off our pants and asking the enemy to spank us. If we lure the enemy deep again, decide to abandon Peiping and Tientsin, and wait for American aid, it is like the plan of eating arsenic to drug a tiger. Although a gentleman is a gentleman to the extreme, what is the point of a dead gentleman in front of a living villain?</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Person with a Carbuncle on Their Back <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Wang Hongxu's "Complete Treatise on Surgical Diseases": "A carbuncle on the back is a major disease among carbuncles and sores. Those with severe redness, swelling, and pain should be called a carbuncle on the back." When I was young, a small sore suddenly appeared on my back, and I panicked. My father smiled at me and said, "There's no such thing. You're too young." I didn't understand what the relationship was between "carbuncle on the back" and "age." Later, when I read the biography of Xiang Yu, I came to the part that stated "Xiang Yu suspected that Fan Zeng was in league with the Han, and gradually stripped him of his power. Fan Zeng was furious and said, 'The affairs of the world are largely settled, and you can do it yourself. I wish to be granted my bones and return to the ranks.' Xiang Yu agreed. Before he reached Pengcheng, a carbuncle developed on his back and he died." Only then did I suddenly understand.</p>
<p>Fan Zeng was returning east from Rongyang. I wonder what he was thinking about on the road? Perhaps he recalled how obedient Xiang Liang had been when he was alive; even the extraordinary plan to establish the grandson of King Huai of Chu as emperor was something he had devised. Perhaps he recalled when Xiang Yu trusted him, respecting him as "Second Father"; during the Battle of Julu, the lords of the various states honored Xiang Yu as commander-in-chief, how impressive it was. Perhaps he thought of the strategy of having Zhang Han and other surrendered generals guard Guanzhong; it was hateful that those rice sacks, Zhang Han and the others, lost Guanzhong overnight. Perhaps he thought of Xiang Yu's discord with him: he had told Xiang Yu not to let go of the great enemy Liu Bang; but Xiang Yu instead personally led the army to suppress the reactionary forces, exhausting himself, while the great enemy marched straight into Guanzhong, almost endangering the very foundation. Thinking about it, nothing went as planned. At first, "not only does the ruler choose his ministers, but the ministers also choose their ruler," like a fish in water, with endless hope. Now that the magic mirror has been broken, even a long-gowned friend cannot avoid being subjected to the arrogance of those in power. A highly respected old minister, reaching the end of his road, looks like a lost dog in distress. The more he thought, the angrier he became; the angrier he became, the more he thought; he developed a carbuncle on his back and died halfway. Wang Hongxu treated carbuncles on the back, advocating "harmonizing the yang and opening the pores, releasing the cold stagnation," but "harmonizing the yang and opening the pores" is easier said than done. Fan Zeng withdrew too late, was old in years, depressed and uneasy, and his qi and blood were not harmonized. In the end, he was beyond cure, and his fate was pitiful! I sympathize with the person with a carbuncle on their back!</p>
<h3 id="e176">From Fashion Exhibitions to National Products Year <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>㈠</p>
<p>The clever entrepreneurs have decided that 1932 will be National Products Year. Therefore, in the newspapers, in the mouths of "celebrities" and "leaders," and in all the large advertisements, we can often see and hear sincere exhortations to "promote national products" and "recover rights and interests." The purpose of these "exhortations" is said to be to "save the country and save the nation."</p>
<p>The customs authorities have also issued warning statistics: last year's import surplus exceeded 550 million taels of silver. Bank business reports all reprinted this figure and issued cries for help. This year, the poor masses are sighing, and the entrepreneurs are also frowning. Everything is infected with the plague of "recession"!</p>
<p>As a result, domestic products have been reduced in price across the board, especially domestic silk and satin. On Nanjing Road, price reduction banners for domestic silk and satin are fluttering in the wind. "The × family is aground × the factory is jointly holding a grand sale, the × family ××× is jointly holding a competitive sale." Foreign loudspeakers and Chinese gongs are desperately shouting from the door towers, and the newspapers are running large advertisements, appealing, exhorting, encouraging, and enticing. Every entrepreneur is trying their best to stimulate the market's purchasing power and entice the people's spending power. It is said that this is for the sake of "the nation"!</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>Purchasing power still cannot be stimulated, because poverty has become widespread in society. Therefore, smart people have come up with new tricks, and this is the recent fashion exhibition. Now let me talk about the grand occasion of the fashion exhibition:</p>
<p>The venue is no different from a dance hall: the musicians continue to play music, and electric lights of various colors flash out various colors. The window glass is all dyed emerald green, and the seats are arranged around the perimeter. Wives, young ladies, young mistresses, school flowers, debutantes, and celebrities sit around like screens. Those who cannot sit stand, one layer, two layers, people crowding people, people squeezing people, anxiously waiting, anxiously looking forward. The fragrance of powder and the smell of sweat mingle in the air, and the air becomes a noisy mass. The white-clad waiters from Guanshengyuan are actively moving back and forth in the crowd.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bright head appears in the crowd, reporting, thanking, apologizing, and saying that Ling Dingding is coming to perform. Ling Dingding is not a dog star.</p>
<p>Ling Dingding appears, a tall man, shouting like an orator: "We must use national products, national products are very good, not using national products is a traitor..." Speaking in a strange voice and gesticulating wildly, the wives and young ladies all laugh, and Ling Dingding also laughs.</p>
<p>Then, the pitiful Qiuxiang, singing a Jiangbei tune in a shrill voice, with beads of sweat the size of beans flowing down her face. Also, learning to dance like a woman, such a big man, twisting and pinching, so the wives and young ladies laugh again, and Ling Dingding also laughs again.</p>
<p>Everyone is still anxiously waiting, the electric lights are flashing their eyes, and the white-clad waiters are coming and going even more vigorously. The wives and young ladies are a little impatient.</p>
<p>Finally, the stars performing the fashion show come, squeezing from the crowd to the center of the venue, one, two, five, eight, stars, queens, national fashion, circling the venue once, so everyone shouts madly, those sitting in the middle squeeze forward, those standing stand on chairs, necks stretched, eyes widened, people squeezing people, people pressing people, hundreds of eyes are fixed on the eight in the center of the venue, eight pieces of fashion, eight advertisements, the photographer is also busy adjusting the light, busy installing the lens, the eight are lined up in a row, the venue is a noisy mass, only a few wooden clothing racks stand upright in the corner of the venue, strangely deserted. Someone whispers in my ear, "Good heavens, a living advertisement, a living clothes rack"!</p>
<p>"The advertisement" goes in, it's over, everyone is refreshed and relieved, takes a long breath, turns around and squeezes, squeezes out of the door.</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>Living advertisements are not only a kind of enticement, a kind of encouragement, they are simply a kind of pressure, forcing people to buy, buy, buy. Waste, as Lhetragedyolwaste describes in his life, is an excerpt from East Hillot's account. He said that some advertisements advised him to eat more bread, some advised him to eat more raisins, some advised him to take the train more often, and some advised him to stay at home more often... only no one advised him to use more coffins!</p>
<p>Who can accept all the advice? What a ridiculous trick!</p>
<p>Waste, everything is wasted without hesitation. This world is indeed overfed; but most people are crying out in hunger and cold. Even living advertisements cannot stimulate their minimum purchasing power. Capitalists and the poor masses are frowning. How desolate this world is!</p>

<p>(Twenty-seven) A Glimpse of the Dance Hall</p>
<p>Singing and dancing constantly, they speak of the Southern Dynasties,</p>
<p>Emerald feathers bright...</p>
<p>Unparalleled scholars...</p>
<p>This old man only sings "Nian Nu Jiao."</p>
<p>One evening, I and my friend returned from a glimpse of the dance hall, and thus recalled Mr. Xiong Xiling's words in "Nian Nu Jiao," and took a sentence to compose a seven-character quatrain. Moreover, since we are meeting the movie queen and advocating saving the country through dancing, we cannot but write a poem to promote it. Last year, the newspaper reported that Mr. Xiong Xiling traveled to West Lake and filled in the "Nian Nu Jiao" lyrics, saying:</p>
<p>The afterglow of the twin peaks, watching the towers and pavilions vying to rise, thousands of households. I sigh that the people of the southeast are exhausted, and the lake and mountains are still singing and dancing. Hearing the Jiangchao from afar, the Xutao roars, all for private feuds. Only the lone cypress stands tall, loyal for thousands of years. I remember the monarchs and ministers of Goujian, lying on firewood and tasting gall, persevering to preserve the territory. An unparalleled beauty can help the country, shaming countless men. The enemy's power is spreading, the court disputes have not stopped, and the Jin soldiers are crossing again. Where is the national soul? Who is the master in the territory today?</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong is, after all, an old man, and his attitude is serious. Although he fills in the old tune of stringed instruments and debauchery, he also contains the solitary feelings of sorrow and concern for the country. If it were a young man, engaged in the "lyrical liberation movement," what is said in the lyrics would be nothing more than "playing mahjong," "minding his own business," and "[expletive] about the country!"</p>

<p>— Written by Jules Kenaro, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Agathe</p>
<p>Replacing Ololine was Agathe, a daughter related to Ololine. Carrot Hair observed the new maid with great curiosity. Within a few days, the Lepic family had shifted their attention from Carrot Hair to the new maid. "Agathe," said the Lepic family, "you should knock on the door before entering a room, but that doesn't mean you have to kick the door through with your hooves like a horse." "She's taken office," thought Carrot Hair, "but let's see how she behaves at mealtime." Everyone gathered in the spacious kitchen to eat. Agathe had a napkin draped over her arm, ready to run from that side to the sideboard, from the sideboard to the dining table, because she didn't know how to walk properly, she would rather run panting, her cheeks flushed. She spoke too fast, laughed too loudly, and wanted to work too hard. Mr. Lepic sat down first, unfolded his napkin, pushed his plate next to the dish in front of him, took some meat and gravy, and dragged the plate back. He poured his own drink, hunched his back, lowered his eyes, and ate carefully, as listless as usual. When changing dishes, he would lower his head, look at the chair, and shift his buttocks. Mrs. Lepic personally divided the food for her children, first for the eldest brother, Felix, because he was shouting that he was hungry, then for the eldest daughter, Eleestine, because she was older, and finally for Carrot Hair, who was sitting at the end of the table. He never asked for more food, as if this was normally forbidden. One portion should be enough for him, and if others gave him more, he would accept it. He didn't drink water, and he filled his mouth with food that he didn't like, just to please Mrs. Lepic, because she was the only one in the family who liked to eat. The eldest brother, Felix, and the eldest daughter, Eleestine, were more free. They finished one portion and wanted a second portion. They followed Mr. Lepic's method and pushed the plate next to the dish for serving. But no one spoke. "What's wrong with them?" thought Agathe. But nothing was wrong with them. They just didn't talk, that's all. She really couldn't help but stretch out her arms and yawn at this family. Mr. Lepic ate slowly, as if chewing on broken glass. Although Mrs. Lepic was normally as talkative as a magpie, at the dining table, she would only use her hands and head to gesture and direct everything. The eldest daughter, Eleestine, raised her eyes and looked at the ceiling. The eldest brother, Felix, played with bread crumbs. Carrot Hair, who didn't have a water glass, only paid attention to when to use bread to wipe his plate clean. He wiped it too quickly, fearing that others would say he was greedy, and wiped it too late, fearing that others would say he was slow. Therefore, he engaged in complicated calculations. Suddenly, Mr. Lepic took the water bottle on the dining table and poured a full bottle of clear water. "I can do this too," said Agathe. No, she didn't say it, she just thought it. She was also infected by them, and her tongue became numb. She didn't dare to speak, but she thought that it was her fault for letting the master pour the water himself, so she became extra careful.

<p>Issue 22 (Published every Monday)</p>
<p>Over ninety years of importing foreign goods, tens of millions of taels of export indemnities, and over twenty years of incessant internal strife and rural bankruptcy, are still only half of the truth. The reality is that the people are impoverished and the wealth is exhausted, and the entire social economy is on the verge of collapse. As for how to revitalize the countryside, neither high-sounding discussions can be effective, nor can extravagant exposition of academic theories and collection of established rules be helpful. As Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Follow our own social situation and meet the world's trends." What is urgently needed now is to solve how the stagnant money in the cities can flow into the hands of the farmers, how the farmers' products can come to the cities, and how to give farmers the opportunity to recuperate, the wish for a well-off family, and to achieve the goal of enriching the people. In a word, construction that can be delayed but must not be neglected, and allowing the people to rest. Stop the oppressive exactions of taxes and pass on the nurturing of life. The cooperative system can indeed be emulated, but we should consider the farmers' level of knowledge and the prejudices of public and private economies. Can they be transferred? Oranges become trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River, let alone the transplantation of all systems? Therefore, the most practical and easy to implement at present is to reform, revise, and promote the existing system. For example, organizing agricultural loans, facilitating low-interest funds and pawnshops, and assisting farmers' gatherings (silver money associations) to engage in production can all make up for the shortcomings of farmers' banks. As for usury, it is indeed a distant cause of rural bankruptcy. We must know that the reason for usury is originally a social pathology. If farmers have ample economies and financial organizations are perfect, how can usury occur? At present, what makes farmers feel even more difficult is precisely the inability to obtain usury. Most of the usurers in rural areas are only one room away from poor farmers. Those who are more substantial, seeing the current situation, dare not lend even if they have money, and instead move cash to the cities to prevent any danger. As a result, the number of chips in the countryside becomes less and less, and the turnover becomes less and less flexible, which brews today's phenomenon. Therefore, the measure to treat the symptoms is still to appeal to the local wealthy households with righteousness and profit, and to give them corresponding guarantees, to persuade them to invest in loans, to appropriately reduce interest rates, or to purchase agricultural products that cannot be stored, in order to broaden the farmers' livelihood. In this issue, we have the honor of receiving masterpieces from Mr. Xu Shuji, Mr. Huang Gutong, Mr. Tang Huizun, and Mr. Huang Tong, all of which are works that combine learning and experience, and cannot be compared with those who simply talk emptily. In addition, we are grateful for the contributions of our readers. Due to space limitations, we cannot prepare for war. We apologize for this. Liu Tang</p>
<h3 id="e180">Rural Revitalization and the Relationship with Farmers <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xuan</p>
<p>Two Major Premises for Establishing Agricultural Policy</p>
<p>In recent years, the cry of "rural bankruptcy" has been rampant in our country. As a result, the so-called agricultural relief plans have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, appearing in words and scattered in newspapers. The government has also gradually paid attention to this, such as the food conferences, agricultural finance conferences, and silk relief conferences, which have been heard from time to time. Recently, the Executive Yuan has even established an Agricultural Revitalization Committee to convene colleagues from all over the country to discuss with each other. Although its contents are not detailed, according to the reports in the newspapers, its general outline can already be seen. Whether it can be actually implemented in the future, or to what extent it can be implemented, I dare not predict now. What is most expected is that no matter what kind of plan or what kind of facilities, they must be based on the farmers. Otherwise, the name of a policy, although sufficient to call for a moment, is not actually the case, or it is counterproductive. Although it comes out of the rural revitalization, I am afraid that the long clothes will be slow, and I do not know when I will see the white of the East.</p>
<p>At present, the agricultural situation in our country is gradually declining. It is certainly necessary to establish various agricultural policies to improve it. However, agriculture cannot improve itself. Those who engage in agriculture are farmers. If we do not first maintain and stabilize the farmers' lives, and want them to improve agriculture with a body that is tired all day long and cannot get enough to eat, can they do it? The rural areas of our country have always been the source of national wealth and the foundation of society. In recent years, the signs of decline have increased with themselves. We must quickly seek revitalization. However, the rural areas cannot revitalize themselves. Those who organize the rural areas are farmers. If we do not first improve the economic conditions of the farmers, so that they can live and work in peace and contentment, and do not see the differences and move away from their hometowns, and want the prosperity of the rural areas, it is also like climbing trees to catch fish. Therefore, if we want to determine or implement agricultural policies or rural revitalization plans, we must always and everywhere focus on the farmers.</p>
<p>Originally, agricultural problems or rural problems have close relationships with politics, economics, education, and all social problems. Therefore, farmers are often dominated by politics, economics, education, and social systems. Therefore, if we want to discuss the relationship between rural revitalization and farmers, the scope involved is very broad and large. Due to space limitations, I cannot describe them one by one. I will just briefly list a few examples from the rural areas themselves to show the necessity of a farmer-based policy.</p>
<p>The great disease of the current rural areas can be summed up in the word "poverty." Therefore, if we want to cure the disease of the rural areas, we must first save the poverty of the rural areas. However, the rural areas are not poor by themselves. The poverty of the farmers who live in the rural areas makes them poor. The way to save poverty is that agricultural financial policy is still the same. However, if this policy is not based on the farmers, its effect will be minimal. In the current Chinese agricultural financial institutions, there are only a few agricultural stars. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are slightly better, but the circulation of agricultural funds is still limited. In the future, agricultural financial institutions should be greatly expanded so that urban finance and rural finance can regulate each other to eliminate the evils of urban expansion and rural decline. However, if we only follow the beautiful name of agricultural finance, and do not consider the interests of the farmers themselves, then the poverty of the farmers is still the same, and the poverty of the rural areas is also the same! For example, the farmers' bank lends money to the farmers so that they can avoid the exploitation of usury. Its intention is very good. However, the amount of benefits the farmers receive still depends on its lending conditions. In terms of the amount of money, the farmers want more and more, but the bank is afraid that the money will be recovered, and it will not give it. The two have their own reasons and cannot be blamed. However, since the farmers want to borrow money to engage in agriculture, if they are honest and trustworthy, the bank should supply it as much as possible. Otherwise, if the farmers borrow 1,000 yuan, the bank only lends 500 yuan, or less than this amount, then the farmers' business plan is broken, although it is better than "one text is not known," but the benefits are very small. In terms of guarantees, small farmers generally have no land and lack credit, so it is difficult to borrow money like climbing to the sky. Even if the bank promises to borrow money on credit, it often asks them to find substantial shops to guarantee before they are willing to lend money. If the farmers can get substantial shops to guarantee them, then their credit is enough to borrow money from other places, why bother begging the bank? He often spends several days trying to find a shop guarantee, but in the end, he cannot find it, and he returns disappointed. Or he has to travel a long distance, which increases the loss. It is very pitiful. In terms of the time limit, agricultural loans should be compatible with the nature of agriculture. To purchase seeds and mulberry leaves, if the time limit is too short, they must be sold cheaply after redemption to repay the debt. How can the farmers benefit from the small amount of harvest? From this point of view, agricultural finance is a good policy for revitalizing the rural areas, but if the loans are not considered for the farmers, then the farmers will not be able to enjoy its actual benefits, so as to improve their economic conditions, and its effect will be minimal. "Backward production" is also the most serious problem in the current rural areas. It seems that encouraging the increase in production cannot be delayed. However, if the production policy is not supported by the price adjustment policy, when production is insufficient, both producers and consumers will suffer; when there is a surplus, consumers may not benefit, and producers may be trapped. For example, the demand for rice is inelastic. Even if the price of rice falls sharply, consumers cannot eat a few more liters of rice every day to the point of being full. If producers are forced to sell each other after the autumn harvest due to the economy, then the price of rice will inevitably fall sharply at one time, which is not enough to compensate for their production costs, and they will be even more embarrassed. The "bumper harvest becoming a disaster" of rice last year is a clear proof of this. Last year, although the rice fields in various provinces were not a great harvest, in recent years, it can be considered a relatively bumper harvest. It is appropriate for production to increase, and the farmers all held their hands in gratitude. However, the facts are the opposite. The price of rice has fallen sharply. The reasons are very complicated, and its impact is also serious in all aspects. People from all walks of life have shouted loudly, all using the term "raising the price of rice." The Ministry of Finance also convened a food conference to seek relief. Not to mention that the policies they proposed have not yet been implemented, even if they are implemented, saving the price of rice may not be of much benefit to the farmers. Most of the farmers have already sold the rice after the autumn harvest, and even if there is surplus grain, the number is very small. Therefore, the price adjustment policy for rice should be considered for the farmers in advance, and ways should be found to maintain its price before the price of rice falls. In this way, the farmers can enjoy the benefits of increased rice production. Otherwise, if we wait until the price of rice falls sharply, and the farmers have no surplus grain, and then begin to seek ways to raise the price of rice in a panic, then when the price of rice falls sharply, the farmers have suffered from the low price of rice. Once the price of rice gradually rises in the spring and summer of the following year, the farmers have to buy rice to fill their hunger, and they suffer from the high price of rice. Therefore, the price adjustment policy for rice, although it is a good method, if it is not based on the farmers and used at the right time, then the farmers will still find it difficult to enjoy the benefits of increased rice production. Not only rice, but also the relationship between the production and price of other agricultural products is the same. Therefore, the production policy and the price adjustment policy should be considered at the same time and adapted to local conditions, so that the price of agricultural products will be stabilized, and the farmers can enjoy the real benefits of increased production. In this way, the economic status of the farmers will be higher day by day, and the rural areas will also prosper accordingly.</p>
<p>The above is only a few points, but from this, it can be seen that agricultural policies and rural revitalization plans must be based on the farmers in order to have any effect. Otherwise, the farmers will be subjected to various oppressions and will not be able to survive. To expect the agriculture operated by the farmers to gradually develop, and the rural areas composed of the farmers to improve day by day, is like asking a cripple to lift a thousand pounds or a lame person to chase a running rabbit. I know that it is impossible. The farmers in our country today are extremely exhausted and are almost without a voice. If we can catch up, support them, and motivate them, so that they can focus on farming and be happy, and so that the strong will not become bandits and the weak will not turn into ditches, then it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If we continue to delay the time, and there are policies that cannot be implemented, or they are implemented in the wrong way, I am afraid that in a few years, the farmers will be on the verge of extinction, and agriculture will be lost forever! Can the future of the country bear to say it? May 10, 20</p>
<h3 id="e181">Rural Revitalization Issues <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Huang Kutong</p>
<p>In the midst of frequent alarms of war and a grave national crisis, the Executive Yuan established the Rural Revitalization Committee. The Yuan invited prominent figures from various fields, held a two-day meeting, and resolved many important matters. It also decided that branch committees should be established in various provinces to undertake investigations, construction, and implementation. It is expected that the work on rural revitalization will be intensified, and the decline of the rural areas will be reversed. This is a matter worthy of celebration.</p>
<p>The detailed content of the matters resolved at the meeting is not yet fully known. However, based on newspaper reports, I do not find any particularly novel strategies. As the saying goes, "There is nothing new under the sun." In the end, it is just rehashing old tunes. For example, the items related to technology, economy, and rural self-governance are mostly things that many central meetings have discussed before (although the names and programs may be different). However, rehashing old tunes is not a mistake but rather indicates that the issue is becoming increasingly profound. Therefore, one should not suppress the rehashing of old tunes, but rather worry about the forgetting of old tunes.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many calls regarding the collapse of rural areas, the suffering of farmers, and the agricultural panic, as well as records of these facts. There is no need to repeat them here. However, we must pay attention to the fact that the collapse of rural areas, the suffering of farmers, and the agricultural panic are not localized or individual issues of rural areas, farmers, or agriculture. Instead, they are nurtured and generated by the functions of the entire political and economic system, as well as feudal forces. This is the so-called internal cause. We must also pay attention to the role of imperialism in colonizing China. This is the so-called external cause. These two causes are intertwined to deplete the vitality, and the rural areas have long been in decline, showing chronic symptoms since at least the Opium War. Since the founding of the Republic, the chronic symptoms have become acute and increasingly profound. In other words, rural areas are not just collapsing, but bankrupt; farmers are not just suffering, but fleeing; agriculture is not just panicking, but failing. If these internal and external causes cannot be resolved, the so-called rural revitalization will ultimately be like quenching thirst with plums or skimming boiling water. Therefore, our first concept should be to eliminate harm, with promoting benefits being secondary. For example, if a person has been sick for a long time and their internal organs are failing, if the doctor does not first use medicine or perform surgery to cleanse the organs and suddenly gives them tonics like ginseng and deer antler, it will not only be useless but may even kill them! The principle of eliminating harm before promoting benefits is the same. Regarding external causes, only by implementing anti-imperialist work can they be resolved. This will not be discussed here for now. As for internal causes, they are the so-called internal affairs issues, which are also a prerequisite for rural revitalization. In other words, the work of eliminating harm is to first implement a passive agricultural policy. In my personal opinion, there are several things that must be resolved first. Briefly stated, they are: ㈠ rural security; ㈡ the high pressure of land taxes; ㈢ the exploitation of usury; ㈣ the exploitation of tenant rents; ㈤ the forced allocation of public bonds; ㈥ the conscription of soldiers and corvée labor; ㈦ exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies; ㈧ opium and gambling; and ㈨ natural disasters. I believe that it is necessary to resolve these nine matters first. However, to resolve these, it is necessary to first break the feudal forces of warlords, bureaucrats, and local bullies. Otherwise, if one drives away the tiger from the front door, a wolf will enter through the back door. The rural areas will still not prosper. As for the suppression of the communists, the government is working hard on it, so there is no need to mention it.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Humble Opinions on Rural Revitalization <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Tang Hui-sun</p>
<p>At a time when our country is plagued by disasters and the people are struggling to survive, the authorities are cautiously advocating rural revitalization as the fundamental plan to save the country. Our country is known as an agricultural country, with agricultural population accounting for eight out of ten. The country's financial resources are mostly derived from rural areas. Nineteen of the foreign trade are agricultural products. Therefore, the fact that the lifeblood of our country's politics and economy today depends on agriculture is also evident. The decline of rural areas and the panic of agriculture have swept the world, and it is not unique to our country. However, after investigating the underlying causes, the agricultural panic in our country is definitely not comparable to the agricultural panic in Europe and America. The agricultural panic in Europe and America is largely due to the development of agricultural technology and overproduction, which are mostly internal causes of agriculture. The agricultural panic in our country is largely due to the internal causes of semi-feudal production relations, such as military disasters, banditry, exorbitant taxes, and heavy labor. Understanding this, the decline of rural areas and the panic of agriculture in our country cannot be compared to the agricultural panic in Europe and America, which are considered purely economic problems. The Rural Revitalization Committee gathered prominent figures in the country to discuss ways to revitalize rural areas. Technology, economy, and organization, various resolutions, are all necessary conditions for rural revitalization. Most of them are proposals that have been made in various central meetings in the past but have not been implemented. If the central government has the sincerity and determination to revitalize the rural areas and can implement these resolutions step by step, the revitalization of the rural areas can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decline of rural areas and the panic of agriculture in our country are due to both internal and external causes. If we only start with the internal improvement of agriculture and the efforts of the farmers themselves to revitalize rural areas, while the political situation remains the same, the disasters of soldiers and bandits are not reduced, and the poor production relations remain the same, then even if agriculture improves and farmers free themselves, the decline of rural areas and the panic of agriculture will not be improved. I make this argument not because I think the methods resolved by the Rural Revitalization Committee are not good. The methods resolved by the Rural Revitalization Committee, which are to improve the problems of the rural areas themselves, are indeed perfect. However, whether they can be implemented and achieve practical results depends only on the improvement of politics in the future, the stability of the local areas, and the implementation of all social policies. Otherwise, the so-called rural revitalization is only equivalent to empty talk on paper and is no different from the various meetings convened by the central government in the past, which were discussed but could not be implemented.</p>
<p>Today, discussions on rural issues are nothing more than the two aspects of agricultural business and farmers' lives. The decline of rural areas is also constituted by the two major causes of the decline of agricultural business and the poverty of farmers' lives. The focus of the decline of agricultural business is the poor production relations. The poverty of farmers' lives is due to the low level of farmers' knowledge. Therefore, to revitalize rural areas, we should first pay attention to these two points. Most of the farmers in our country are small farmers. The area of cultivated land per household is not even enough to distribute the labor of the family. Even if all the income belongs to them, it is not enough for their livelihood. Moreover, a large part of it must be paid for rent and exorbitant taxes. How can we expect farmers not to be poor and rural areas not to decline? This is like climbing a tree to catch fish, how can it be possible? Therefore, I say that if we do not want to revitalize rural areas, then so be it. If we want to revitalize rural areas, we must first change the agricultural production relations, implement land policies, and realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of equal land rights and the tiller owning his land. Once the production relations are changed and the area of cultivated land per household is expanded, the agricultural labor can be rationally allocated, and agricultural technology can be adopted. As a result, production increases and income is abundant, and the problems of agricultural business can be solved.</p>
<p>Education in our country is mostly biased towards cities. Even in the developed areas of education in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the so-called rural education is still far from being universal. No wonder the villagers are ignorant and at the mercy of others, and all the undertakings in the rural areas are controlled by a small number of local bullies and ruffians. The poverty of farmers' lives is caused by the ignorance of farmers' knowledge, which prevents them from forming self-help and mutual-aid organizations. Therefore, to improve farmers' lives and promote rural autonomy, we should first popularize rural education to increase farmers' knowledge, which is a crucial plan. In recent years, our country has been vigorously promoting agricultural cooperation, and the Rural Revitalization Committee has also paid attention to this point. The cooperative system can regulate rural finance and increase farmers' production. The method is good and the intention is beautiful, and it should be promoted extensively to be established throughout the rural areas of our country, which is also an important item for rural revitalization. However, the cooperative system</p>
<p>takes the spirit of self-help and mutual aid, and the key is that "everyone is for me, and I am for everyone." Therefore, it is easy to promote cooperative enterprises, but it is difficult to make them succeed. Denmark is known as the world's model agricultural country. Its agricultural development is due to the success of the cooperative system. The success of the cooperative system depends entirely on the foundation of rural education as its precursor. Finally, I would like to add one more point, which is about the issue of rural financial relief. The Rural Revitalization Committee has definite methods for rural financial relief. It has also requested the Shanghai Banking Association to initiate the establishment of a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee to assist in the adjustment of rural finance. If it can be implemented, the benefits to the villagers will be significant. I believe that the adjustment of agricultural finance lies in the ability to transfer the finance concentrated in the cities to the rural areas. So that the finance of a country can circulate and turn around like the circulation of blood, and not stagnate and wither. Therefore, the establishment of rural financial institutions must be based on this intention. However, at present, the Farmers Bank and Agricultural and Industrial Bank in various provinces of our country are still established in large cities. They cannot directly lend to farmers, nor can they transfer their funds to the local areas to achieve financial decentralization, which loses the fundamental purpose of rural financial decentralization. I believe that the current agricultural financial institutions in our country must strive to decentralize and spread to remote rural areas, so that even if their funds are small, the villagers can still get the real benefits of financial accommodation. Otherwise, although we talk about adjusting rural finance, it is just enough to promote the concentration of finance in the cities. This is also a point that should be noted in rural revitalization. The above mentioned are plain and unremarkable, and inevitably old-fashioned. However, if they can be implemented one by one, the benefits to our farmers will not be small.</p>
<p>Although the rural areas of China have been subjected to imperialist aggression for a long time, their core is still dominated by feudal forces. The production relations in rural areas are still feudal and dominated by land. Therefore, the land issue is a serious issue that must be resolved. Most of the farmers in China do not have land, and those who do have very little (the average area per household is less than thirty mu).</p>
<p>In this way, new farming methods and new technologies cannot be promoted, the means of production cannot be changed, the productive forces cannot be increased, and the rural economy cannot be enriched. Therefore, I believe that from a positive policy perspective, we should first change the current production relations in rural areas. However, given the current situation, changing the production relations in rural areas is easier said than done. If we can achieve the so-called "the tiller owns his land," it would already be a remarkable achievement. In short, what is most hoped for now is to implement a passive agricultural policy, which is to achieve the work of eliminating harm. In the old-fashioned way, it is hoped that we can soothe and recuperate the people, and in the new terminology, it is to implement the liberation of farmers. Otherwise, every time we take an action, the farmers will suffer one more point of pain. As the saying goes, "Three more things to erect a spirit tablet means more ghosts." This is not because the policy itself is bad, but because of the relationship between the root and the branch. Furthermore, based on the facts, those who implement policies often abuse their power for personal gain and use the name of new policies to carry out extortion. Farmers not only have no power to accept it but are also frightened by it. If the new things are not based on the objective situation but are created behind closed doors, it will be even worse, and the majority of farmers will be sacrificed. Or, if it is handled too eagerly and without regard to the interests of the farmers, it will cause trouble. Therefore, it is not only wrong to intentionally harm the government, but it is also impossible to cut one's feet to fit the shoes. What do farmers need most now? In my opinion, the first is to need peace and to eliminate all kinds of oppression and exploitation. Therefore, if we can eliminate harm for the farmers, it will be equivalent to stimulating their function of promoting benefits. Shanghai has accumulated a large amount of cash, which indicates the fact that rural areas are bankrupt and the interior finance is exhausted. Therefore, this time the Rural Revitalization Committee resolved to "request the Shanghai Banking Association to initiate the establishment of a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee, and the banks will jointly or freely do their best to assist in the adjustment of rural finance." Since last year, the sound of banks in Shanghai lending money to save agriculture has been loud.</p>
<p>But how much money has been actually lent out and how many farmers have been saved? After this meeting, it is expected that the bankers will be able to make further efforts, and the majority of farmers who are struggling to survive are waiting for the arrival of the god of wealth.</p>
<p>The establishment of any policy should be based on objective facts, and the implementation of policies requires the concerted efforts of the government, public and private organizations, individuals, and other parties in order to achieve success. Furthermore, there should be a specialized agency to conduct continuous research and expose the objective facts without reservation as the basis for establishing policies, so as to avoid the problem of building a car behind closed doors and not being able to fit the tracks when going out. After the establishment of the Rural Revitalization Committee this time, it is hoped that it can truly and practically implement the work of revitalizing rural areas. What will be the results in the future? Helpless farmers are waiting for the elixir to revive them!</p>
<p>I have said some nonsense above, and the planned number of words has been reached, so I will submit the paper. (May 9, 22nd year of the Republic)</p>
<h3 id="e183">Revitalizing Rural Areas and the Issue of Agricultural Usury <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Huang Tong</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the collapse of agriculture and rural bankruptcy are the most serious problems in China today. Because China's current economic stage is still stagnant in a small-scale agricultural economy, "Agriculture is the foundation of the world and the people depend on it for their livelihood; if the foundation is not solid, the country will not be stable." This old-fashioned saying is still very applicable now! The Executive Yuan invited contemporary celebrities and experts to hold a meeting on revitalizing rural areas in the capital on the 5th and 6th of this month and passed many programs. This is indeed a grand event worthy of our excitement! However, how can rural areas be revitalized? The most important thing is to prevent farmers from escaping the villages and to make them live and work in peace and contentment. To make farmers live and work in peace and contentment, it is especially important to eliminate the relations of production of exploitation and being exploited in the rural areas. Of course, the implementation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, "The tiller should have his land," is a prerequisite and fundamental condition for revitalizing rural areas. The scope of this issue is very large, and there is no time to discuss it in detail here. Now, let me briefly mention the situation of agricultural usury to glimpse a small part of the exploitative relations in rural areas. II.</p>
<p>Usury is when lenders use their economically strong position to exploit borrowers through heavy interest rates to achieve the purpose of exploitation. In other words, it is the exploitation of heavy interest rates. Under the current private property system, there are rich people who "own tens of thousands of yi" on one side and poor households who "have nothing but bare walls" on the other. Exploitation of heavy interest rates exists everywhere, and it is not limited to rural areas. However, rural areas are particularly brutal due to various special reasons. The rampant usury in rural areas is due to the difficulties in rural finance. There are many reasons for the lack of capital in rural areas, the most important of which is the accelerated concentration of capital in cities. In recent years, the surge in bank savings and cash reserves in various commercial ports has been almost the same. Shanghai is the most prominent. The silver reserves in Shanghai in November of the 21st year of the Republic were only 57,899,000 taels, but by January of this year (22nd year of the Republic), they had increased to 144,959,000 taels, more than doubling. The silver dollar reserves in March of the 20th year of the Republic were 13,379,000 yuan, but by January of this year, they had increased to 22,417,000 yuan, more than doubling. The phenomenon of cash accumulation can be seen (see Yang Yin-pu's "Urban Finance and Rural Finance in China," New China, Volume 1, Issue 8). Recently, the daily increase in the exchange rate of copper coins, how can we know that it is not because the rural areas are short of silver and are sending copper coins out?</p>
<p>On the other hand, in rural areas, farmers' savings are being depleted more and more. The savings of middle-class farmers do not exceed ten or twenty yuan, and some even cannot find one yuan in cash (see the Bank of China's Business Report for the 21st year of the Republic)! Seen from the countryside, farmers cannot find a few copper coins. The "money shortage" in rural areas has reached such a degree that the rampant usury and the intensification of its exploitation are "inevitable." III. The forms of usury in rural areas can be generally divided into four types: money, livestock, land, and goods. ㈠ Money Usury: In addition to lending money at very high interest rates, there are also cases where the interest rate is normal, but the principal is discounted when the money is initially delivered; or a note is made for an amount higher than the actual amount borrowed, and the borrower is required to repay the full amount later. In addition, taking advantage of the poverty of farmers to buy their beneficial claims against third parties at very low prices is also a type of money usury. ㈡ Livestock Usury: When farmers with less capital lose their livestock and cannot afford to buy them again, their distress is used to lend them livestock for raising. After a certain period, usually after the livestock gives birth, the total number or price of the livestock is divided equally between the two parties; or the lender gets the young livestock, and the borrower gets the mother livestock. This method may seem innocent on the surface; however, livestock merchants often take advantage of this loan contract to overestimate the price of the livestock at the time of lending and underestimate it at the time of distribution, thereby taking excessive profits. Livestock merchants are superior in capital and often control the monopoly of buying and selling in a locality, thereby manipulating market prices, so their harm to farmers may not be second to anyone. ㈢ Land Usury: When small and medium-sized farmers or hired laborers are eager to obtain land, they sell their land at very high prices; or they lend their land at very high rents to reap huge profits. ㈣ Goods Usury: This mostly occurs when farmers and debtors have a debt relationship. For example, the farmers' produce is estimated at a low price to offset the principal and interest; or cheap goods are sold to farmers at high prices, all of which are their usual tricks. Among the above four types, money usury is the most common, followed by livestock usury and goods usury, and land usury is relatively rare. These four types have no clear boundaries, and there are many names for them, too many to list.</p>
<p>IV. The evils of usury have long been recognized by the general public, especially in rural areas. As a result of rampant usury, self-cultivating farmers are reduced to tenant farmers, then to hired laborers, and then to unemployed people. Driven by hunger and cold, they take risks, and then gather in the mountains and forests to kill and rob, eventually becoming a major scourge to the country (the rise and fall of a part of the Twenty-Four Histories are all like this)! No one is born to be fond of making trouble. In recent years, bandits have been everywhere, and violence has been rampant, most of which are caused by the environment. To eliminate evil fruits, we must first eliminate evil causes. Therefore, the crackdown on usury is urgent! The methods of combating usury are nothing more than two: the passive one is to stipulate the highest interest rate by the state and use the law to enforce it; the active one is to establish agricultural financial institutions to facilitate the flow of capital. If there is only passive resistance, it will never be able to eliminate it, why? Because under the social system of profit-seeking, it is a very natural fact that capital generates interest; and the level of interest rates is inextricably linked to the prosperity and decline of enterprises and the abundance or shortage of capital, which cannot be controlled by an order or a mere scrap of paper. In the past, political economists with ethical ideas invariably opposed lending capital for interest. The philosopher Aristotle even advocated the theory of non-fecundity of money (Baerten theory of mcney), meaning that money is a medium of exchange, and its intrinsic value cannot generate any wealth, so lending money for interest is extremely improper. The medieval scholastic philosophers (Scholagtiker)</p>
<p>and canonists (canonis) believed that wealthy lenders charging interest to poor borrowers was contrary to God's command and also advocated prohibition. However, due to practical necessity, they gradually learned about the convenience of it! Canon law (anonlaw) records three exceptions: namely, the property owner's claim for compensation for losses suffered due to lending (DamnuMEmergens), the claim for compensation for lost profits (lucram cssans) due to lending, and the claim for compensation for risks incurred due to lending (Perlculam sortis) are not regarded as interest and are considered legitimate rights. Secondly, regarding the statutory interest rate, predecessors also advocated it. For example, the Englishman Josiah Child in the 17th century admired the wealth and power of the Netherlands and vigorously advocated the statutory interest rate, believing that the wealth and power of the Netherlands was due to the low interest rate; the level of interest rates was not based on external natural conditions, but the government could freely decide with public power, so if the government wanted to enrich the country and benefit the people, the first thing it had to do was to use its power to limit the market interest rate. However, what is the reality? In the 16th year of the Republic, the 111th Central Political Conference of the Kuomintang resolved that the maximum annual interest rate should not exceed 20% and issued an order to the whole country to comply with it. However, facts tell us that the creditors under the rule of the National Government still exploited heavy interest rates as before, and even disobeyed the law and intensified their efforts. For example, in order to avoid conflict with the law, they first added the interest to the principal, or deducted the interest in advance, and wrote on the contract the words "borrowed a certain amount of money, with an annual interest rate of "one point"." In this way, even if the government wants to crack down, it cannot start! As mentioned above, under the current social system of private property, interest and interest rates cannot be prohibited or restricted by simply issuing an order, which is already clear. Then, the crackdown on usury must seek another active method, which is to establish agricultural financial institutions. In our country, the existing rural financial institutions include money shops, pawnshops, and mutual aid societies; the emerging ones include agricultural banks and rural credit cooperatives, etc., which also have a considerable number. However, the existing ones are gradually declining and mostly transformed into tools for exploiting farmers; the emerging ones are mostly nominal and have weak strength. It can be said that there are "absolutely none" that can truly facilitate agricultural credit and provide assistance to rural areas!</p>
<p>This time, the Rural Revitalization Committee passed the outline proposed by the Economic Group, in which, regarding rural economic issues, it advocated the establishment of a farmers' bank in each province in addition to cooperatives, with branches established in various places in the province, and the establishment of agricultural warehouses in various counties; at the same time, the existing pawnshops in various places should still be supported by the provinces to the best of their ability. On the one hand, it has requested the Shanghai Banking Association to initiate the establishment of a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee to do its best to assist in the adjustment of rural finance. It can be said that "the key is raised and the mesh is stretched, without missing a single detail"! If it can be actively promoted, the dilapidated and dying rural areas may have hope of revitalization! (May 10, 22nd year of the Republic)</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to favorable weather, then rose due to short covering, and finally fell again due to reactionary selling. As a result, spot prices fell by ten points, and futures fell by ten to fifteen points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures rose by four to five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by four points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to purchases by Japanese and European exporters.

<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Recently, flower clubs have flourished, bringing booming business to pawnshops and Buddhist temples, with the middle and lower classes being the most addicted, especially women and workers. This is indeed a very serious social problem. Gambling is said to be most prevalent in America, where even a presidential election involves betting. However, it is even more common in China. Whether it's the points on a card, the number of copper coins in hand, or even whether it will be sunny or rainy tomorrow, or whether a newborn child is male or female, everything can be bet on. Mahjong is even known as the "national game." In short, everything in the hands of the Chinese becomes gambling material. Gambling is essentially an immature psychology, linked to luck and laziness, which is a social pathology. Those who rely on luck are unwilling to work diligently and practically, always hoping for instant success and immense profits. In business, they expect others to support them; in earning money, they dream of winning the lottery, unwilling to make their own efforts, fantasizing about unexpected encounters. If they suffer a loss, instead of seeking help from others, they hope for natural disasters to befall the other party. This is truly an unhealthy and decadent phenomenon, yet it is prevalent today among both the government and the common people. The government seeks to make a windfall, such as by increasing taxes and soliciting donations instead of developing real industries, which is the same principle as the common people playing flower clubs. The foundation for this pathology is laziness. Lazy people's behavior and thoughts are inversely proportional. The lazier their behavior, the more fanciful their thoughts. Because they lack practical ability, they seek fulfillment in fantasy. Those who dream of becoming immortals or Buddhas to save the world are unwilling to put in even a little effort into producing food and clothing for the present world, which is clear evidence of this. Therefore, instant success is merely the delusion of fools, and undeserved gains and unexpected requests are only hoped for by lazy people, and gambling is a manifestation of this inferior nature. Sound-minded people only know to accumulate little by little and work steadfastly, without dreaming of ascending to heaven in one step. However, how many sound-minded people are there? The transformation of national psychology still requires effort.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Resisting Donations <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>"Judging from the newspaper, the students are going to solicit donations along the road again. But we have to leave early and return late. If we run into them, we're not happy to give money, but we also feel embarrassed not to. It's really annoying." Our warehouse supervisor, the burly Lao Cao, held a copy of Shen Bao and muttered resentfully.</p>
<p>"I have a solution! As long as one of us donates one yuan, gets a badge, and we all use it, we can pass without hindrance. If we divide it among our sixteen colleagues, each person only pays six fen and two and a half li. Wouldn't that be cheaper and nicer?" The opium addict Lao Chen shrugged his shoulders and devised this plan.</p>
<p>"No! No! The last time I encountered these students asking for donations on the road, I deliberately asked them how much they needed. They said with a smile, 'Whatever you want.' So I solemnly took out a copper coin and gave it to them. Although they were angry, they couldn't do anything because they had said 'whatever you want.' Haha! How satisfying is that? Six fen and two and a half li is enough to eat ten more soup dumplings." Lao Cao said triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Right..."</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, dinner is ready!" The tea boy A Gen shouted, and everyone scattered.</p>
<p>This is an informal meeting record from our factory yesterday after the afternoon work and before dinner. Lao Cao and Lao Chen are originally Laurel and Hardy in our factory. Recently, they have also been appointed as the secretaries of the Deputy King of Hell, so the plans they come up with are always superior. I hope all readers of the newspaper will learn from their cleverness, so that the benevolent and righteous Japanese will come to Shanghai and treat us to a feast.</p>

<p>The reputation, making a living.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a hell on earth, filled with a menacing and uneasy atmosphere. Every trade has its own path, and there are ways for loafers, hooligans, petty thugs, show-offs, and prostitutes. As long as you open your eyes and observe, there are endless mysteries. At the corners of the streets and in amusement parks, you can often see loafing friends squaring off like fighting roosters. If you provoke their anger, they will tilt their heads, stare with triangular eyes, and shout:</p>
<p>"Who is your leader?"</p>
<p>This way, he is telling you that he has his superior, his leader (not a committee member or the mayor, but his brother). He wants to know if you know your place. An experienced friend, without showing weakness, will inquire about his "leader." Or, if a fight breaks out, don't be afraid, he will say, "Let's go to the Qinglian Pavilion for a chat, meet some friends." This is his "leader." Change the approach, beg for mercy. This is no small matter, roll up your sleeves, raise what seems like his unique bare fists, and change his tone:</p>
<p>"Calling you to make a living!"</p>
<p>In this case, you'd better be calm and ready to fight. Watch his movements. If you have strength, you might as well strike first and let him taste your living. At this time, someone claiming to be "one of us" will come out to mediate. You can let go and say a few words:</p>
<p>"We're all one of us, let's just let it go!"</p>
<p>There are many tricks like this, but I haven't tried these tricks. Coming to Shanghai forever, there will always be a chance to taste something fresher!</p>
<h3 id="e191">Entanglements in Dissolving the Engagement of a Child Bride <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My younger sister is twenty-one years old this year. She was betrothed to a farmer in the same village when she was young. When she was nine years old, because my mother passed away, and my father and I were both working elsewhere, my uncle (the matchmaker) took my sister to the other family as a child bride without permission. Who knew that her in-laws would be fierce and treat my sister cruelly in every way. My sister couldn't bear it any longer and escaped back to her parents' home, vowing never to go back to her in-laws' home. Seeing this situation, we felt sorry for her, so we brought her to Shanghai to make a living. Several years passed, and the other family didn't ask about her. Even when the war broke out in Shanghai, her in-laws turned a deaf ear. Unexpectedly, this spring, the other family contacted me, demanding that my sister be sent back to get married. Sir, my sister now</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>has made up her mind to dissolve the engagement with the other family. However, because the other family has raised my sister for several years, they are demanding compensation for their losses. It seems that if my sister doesn't go home to get married, the other family won't let me go. If I don't acknowledge the compensation for their losses, this matter will become a stalemate, or they might file a lawsuit against me. After much thought, I don't know what to do. Please advise me on a way out. I would be most grateful! Respectfully, Xia Qu.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Judging from the letter, your sister's fiancé doesn't seem to be stubborn. Although they haven't explicitly agreed to the dissolution of the engagement, the demand for compensation for losses can be seen as an implicit agreement. After the engagement is dissolved, your sister and the other family will naturally have no relationship, so the other family will have no obligation to support her. Their demand for compensation for losses is justified. As for the uncle taking her there without permission, since you didn't immediately object at the time or take effective action, you can't use this as an excuse to shirk responsibility now. At the same time, regarding the abuse, if you have solid evidence to prove that she absolutely couldn't live there, it can naturally be considered the fault of the other family, and you can demand unconditional dissolution of the engagement. Now that many years have passed, the physical evidence is gone, and the testimony of witnesses can't be relied on, so it's really impossible to trace back. Therefore, the best thing to do is to keep the documents they are asking for compensation for losses; the engagement can definitely be dissolved, but the losses must also be compensated. Dissolution of the engagement is one thing, and compensation is another, proceed separately. As for the compensation, there are two points that can be discussed. ⑴ The determination of the amount; the cost of raising her can vary greatly, with anything from ten to over a hundred yuan per year being considered reasonable. It's best to ask an impartial person to act as an intermediary and determine the amount appropriately based on the family's living conditions. ⑵ Discussion of fulfillment; judging from the letter, Mr. Xia doesn't seem to be a wealthy person, so where would he get such a large sum of money at once? You should discuss with the other family to pay in installments. If this matter goes to court in the end, the result will inevitably be "the engagement between the two parties is allowed to be dissolved; the woman should compensate the man for losses of a certain amount (determined by the judge based on the circumstances)." As for the method of payment, it is a matter of enforcement and a matter of fact. If you really can't come up with it, you can't escape the method of paying in installments, and you won't be jailed! But in all honesty, this loss should be compensated; therefore, after the amount is determined, Mr. Xia should try his best to plan. It's not okay to deliberately deceive and try to deny it.</p>

<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>Many people say that frequent dreaming is a sign of mental weakness; however, not dreaming is too depressing. I am a weak person, so I can't help but be overcome by this consolation, however slight! In recent days, I have been dreaming almost every night.</p>
<p>⑴</p>
<p>I stand proudly on the earth, looking out at thousands of mountains and rivers, all faintly hidden in the clouds and mist. All I see before me is red earth for thousands of miles, stretching endlessly. I wander forward, and I look back again; I feel that the vastness of the world is full of crises, conspiracies, and selfishness. Although there is no one here, can you say for sure that there won't be a trap in front of you? The roars of lions and tigers are getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>I don't know when a high mountain appeared before my eyes. The mountain was surrounded by a radiant golden light. My eyes were dazzled, my head was dizzy. Undoubtedly, those who live on top are immortals and gods?</p>
<p>I struggled to support myself and walked forward, but the golden light shrank with my footsteps. Finally, I walked to the bottom of the high mountain, and the golden light disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>Here, I sit on a stone, looking up. I see capitalists whipping workers, I see thieves robbing in broad daylight: I also see soldiers killing each other; I see people wearing masks, deceiving each other... I feel disappointed in everything. Are humans living in golden light not the same as humans all over the world? My heart is broken! So-called immortals and gods are only like this! I curse the people, and I curse the people on the high mountain even more: I stand up weakly and walk forward blankly. The gentle breeze blows slowly, and the waves in the sea gently ripple. Where will you drift, floating duckweed!</p>
<p>Golden light is born with my feet, and when I look back, it is already shining tens of thousands of feet high. No matter the traitors and thieves, no matter the killings, everything is shrouded in golden light; from the surface, I only feel a purple aura and auspicious clouds. Alas! Hypocrisy! Hypocrisy! I hate you, I curse you! You have killed all of humanity's hearts, you have dirtied the clean land! This world is all your power, where can I find a piece of innocence?</p>
<p>⑵</p>
<p>I am alone, walking among thousands of people. The noisy voices of people hum around me. Several people who look familiar say to me in my ear: "Hou Ying, justice has failed!" I am shocked and turn around to ask: "Really?" But they don't answer and leave by themselves.</p>
<p>I feel annoyed in my heart, like a criminal about to be executed! The rumbling of cannons is endless: smoke rises on all sides, covering the soldiers in battle. They don't know who they are fighting, and I don't know who is fighting whom?</p>
<p>The masses of people are waving flags and shouting in the air; gradually they are divided into two factions. Clearly, the eastern flag bears the words "Power"; while the western flag flutters with "Justice". But alas! There are only two or three hunched-back figures standing under "Justice"!</p>
<p>Needless to say, "Justice" has retreated. During the time when they are insisting without deciding, I see several people jumping out from the "Power" side wearing masks with smiling faces; they stand in the center of the battle, seeming to want to make peace. But I see in their hearts that they are full of wanting to eat these two or three "supporters of justice".</p>
<h3 id="e193">Pain! Serious Injury! National Humiliation, May 5, 5, 5, 30, Xi Yuan! <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>"Justice" failed, they clap their hands and cheer in the air; I can't bear to see it anymore and turn around to leave.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Difficult to Submit, Difficult for the Editor <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Pengnian's article in this magazine, "The Life of Selling Writing," treated the author as an equal, feeling that selling one's heart's blood is the most miserable profession, and many writers revealed a cry that they dared not raise their voices between the lines. A writer, whether famous or not, squeezes his own brains in the same way when writing articles. The works of famous writers are certainly easier to sell than those of the unknown; the price can also be increased, but there are also difficulties for the famous after they become famous. The crystallization of their brains cannot be scribbled on like the works of the unknown, because their works have been noticed, and they have to grasp people's belief in him. When a work is published, they have to be cautious when starting to write. If they lose their inspection even slightly, they will be scolded by jealous people if their work regresses compared to previous works. The "criticism" in the Chinese literary world is fundamentally transferred by the emotions of the critic and the author: the same faction praises it as a masterpiece of meticulous work, and the opposition scolds it worse than dog excrement. Therefore, a famous writer often publishes a thin book only every year and a half.</p>
<p>As for unknown writers, if you want to squeeze into our literary world, that is difficult, difficult, and the third one is still difficult. They all take the supplements of various newspapers as experimental grounds. Although it is relatively easy to publish, they must first understand the purpose of various supplements when writing, and should cater to their preferences and not go against them. After the manuscript is sent out, they look forward to seeing their name on the list of successes every day. The taste of that disappointment and expectation is only understood by those who have experienced it, and I apologize for not being able to describe this state of mind that is both surprised and happy. Imagine that you are full of good works that you think will make you stand out, but are closed in the wastebasket by the editor, and you will naturally be angry. If you encounter obstacles again and again, you will get angry at the editor for not having eyes, worshiping idols, and taking care of friends. This is the editor's undeserved disaster. Many people say: "To be an editor, you only need to have the power to appreciate words!" I am not afraid of being thick-skinned, and I have also been a supplement editor for three months. In addition to the power to appreciate words, you must have the ability to "see everywhere and listen to all directions." You must also be able to accept scolding and endure anger, otherwise, please step down. Although I cannot represent all the editors in admitting that editors worship idols, it is inevitable to some extent. (May I ask Buddha-kun if he thinks so?) There is probably no reason why the manuscripts of friends are not taken care of a little, and it is not that the editors are not afraid of being scolded. This is exactly where it is difficult to be an editor! The selection of manuscripts must keep up with the times, catch the tide, and cater to the readers, but sometimes "I want both fish and bear's paw", and the space is limited, so the act of cutting it out with a heavy heart and causing injustice to sink to the bottom is common, and those who scold you will definitely not let you go. It is not easy to submit, and it is also difficult to edit!</p>

<h3 id="e195">Prison Visit <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Editor: My friend, Mr. Someone, was detained for gambling and sentenced to five months in prison. Yesterday, his wife went to visit him and learned that he was seriously ill in prison. He lacks both caretakers and medicine, and his life and future are worrying. I have come to consult with you, intending to visit him together and seek a remedy. However, because of the regulation that "family visits are limited to once a month at most", we were turned away. I think that Mr. Someone's crime is not punishable by death, and I cannot bear to let him die of illness in prison. I wonder if there is any remedy? Please advise! (Sincerely, Hu Zhengzhi)</p>

<p>Editor's Note: In ancient times, criminal policy adopted a retributive approach; in the Middle Ages, it adopted a suppressive approach, sparing no harsh punishments, believing it was a plan to punish one as a warning to a hundred. In modern times, humanitarianism is gradually becoming more popular, and criminal policy is also adopting a reformative approach. Except for a few criminals who "are unlikely to repent" and are sentenced to death, the rest are sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. During the execution period, reformative education is applied, and the highest principle is to "make the prisoner a pillar of society after being released from prison". Therefore, both the physical and mental health of the prisoner must be taken into account. Although prisons in various places have various regulations for the sake of easy management, they must not violate this principle in the end. The prison that Mr. Hu mentioned may have a regulation that "family visits are limited to once a month at most"; but there must be other regulations for sick prisoners to provide relief. However, unscrupulous prison officials saw that you did not understand the regulations and deliberately made things difficult, wanting to make some money. The best thing to do now is to submit a petition to the court, apply for release for medical treatment; and also hire a lawyer - not necessarily a very famous one, it will cost too much money! Accompany them on the visit. With someone who is familiar with the law as a companion, the prison officials will not dare to cheat.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Little Van朋克 Accused of Seducing Another Man's Wife After Losing His Own <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Little Van朋克's luck has been truly bad recently.  After announcing his separation from Joan Crawford, he is now being sued by a German singer named Jorgen Dietz, who accuses him of seducing his ex-wife, leading to their divorce, and demands compensation of 60,000 yuan.  However, Little Van朋克's attitude is also very stubborn. He says this is pure extortion, and that movie stars have always been blackmailed, even when innocent, they would rather pay some money to settle privately for the sake of peace.  But he wants to be motivated from now on to break this bad habit. Of course, many people in Hollywood hope that Little Van朋克 can win, because he has a lot of evidence that can prove that both parties are suspected of extortion.</p>
<p>Little Van朋克 said, "I know Alma Telma, Jorgen Dietz's ex-wife. We met in a film studio, just like I met countless other men and women. But to say that I would pick her out of thousands of women to be my sweetheart or future wife is out of the question. I can't just meet a woman, say a few words to her, and have it count as if I've already agreed to marry her."</p>
<p>When Jorgen Dietz first said that Little Van朋克 had seduced his wife and wanted him to pay for a settlement, Jorgen went to see Van's manager. He said that Van must pay up, because Van caused him to lose his wife and must remarry, but he had no money for the wedding. Van's manager, hearing Jorgen Dietz's words, knew that his purpose was to extort money, so he decided not to give money and would rather go to court. However, that manager, for the sake of prudence, consulted with a local prosecutor, who sent someone to investigate the matter. Later, Jorgen Dietz brought a woman named 露惜都蘭, who married Jorgen Dietz after Jorgen Dietz and Alma Telma divorced. This new couple came to Little Van朋克's place and insisted on selling jewelry worth 300 yuan to Little Van朋克 for 6,000 yuan. At that time, the representative of the local prosecutor was present and witnessed the matter. As a result, Little Van朋克 and his manager were willing to pay 1,500 yuan to buy it. Jorgen Dietz agreed and immediately paid a check, and both parties concluded the case. However, after Jorgen Dietz and his wife left, they were taken away for questioning by the representative of the local prosecutor. Therefore, Jorgen Dietz sued Little Van朋克, demanding compensation for the loss of his wife of 5,000 yuan. Another 1,000 yuan for illegal detention, totaling 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Little Van朋克 said, "If I am guilty, I would of course be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to settle the case. But this matter is entirely extortion. How can I give in? You must know that the time and lawyer fees I have spent on this case are definitely more than just a few thousand dollars."</p>
<h3 id="e197">Review of "Explosion Machine" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>The plot, direction, acting, and photography are all excellent</p>
<p>The Nanjing Grand Theater premiered Fox Company's "Explosion Machine" yesterday. It is a good film that satirizes life in the style of Bernard Shaw. The film's plot is humorous, the direction is perfect, the acting is natural, and the photography's technique and light are soft and reach the top level. The title "Explosion Machine" seems to suggest a "thrilling" supernatural film, but in reality, it is not.</p>
<p>The screenplay of this film is divided into two segments. The first, shorter section can be said to be the prologue, narrating how an American teenager, Robert, travels in Paris and encounters a beautiful woman, Eleanor, due to a car accident. This American teenager secretly boards a mail ship in pursuit of love, and thus the film introduces the larger, later segment, which is the main plot of "Explosion Machine." The main plot of "Explosion Machine" takes a large ship braving the waves as its backdrop, and the various passengers on the ship as its characters. The unpredictable nature of life can thus be naturally depicted. Its subject matter is similar to "Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>The subject matter of "Explosion Machine" mainly utilizes humanity's weakness of fearing death and clinging to life. The ship's radio operator fabricates a telegram saying that someone is plotting to blow up the ship in the middle of the night, implying the end of the world in people's minds. Thus, the captain with a chronic illness who is about to die, the veterinary professor, the wealthy man who exploits the poor, the old aunt who is afraid of death, the singer with a crisp voice! Each passenger suspects each other, each expressing the fear of an impending doomsday hidden in their minds, as well as the various ugly behaviors that humans should reveal at the critical moment of life and death. Humanity's selfish and self-interested base nature is thus displayed without reservation.</p>
<p>Roses have thorns, and the path of love is full of thorns. Robert and Eleanor's love in the film "Explosion Machine" is also depicted tortuously and naturally according to this idea. Many movie stars, such as John Barrymore, only know how to act with a straight face, and many movie stars, such as 雷門那伐樂, always like to perform with a smiling face. In this film, the young actor 吉士德馬烈斯 plays the American teenager with a sense of humor, maintaining his original acting style. The other actors, such as 琴娜 陶屏 who plays Eleanor, are able to express the different characteristics of the characters in the play. In the dialogue, several silent fragments are inserted to narrate the backgrounds of the characters in the play, which is more convenient than introducing them scene by scene. As for the dialogue in the film, it is indeed very witty, but it feels a bit too much. The most dramatic point of this film lies in the suspended theme of the end of the world, in grasping a kind of suspicion on the ship, and depicting it scene by scene, culminating in the discovery that it is just a castle in the air, a false alarm.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Review of "Lipstick Market" <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>—凌鶴</p>
<p>A better work among sound films</p>
<p>The director has made significant progress</p>
<p>After Star Film Company raised the issue of women's liberation in "A Woman's Cry," it has re-raised this issue in "Lipstick Market." We will not forget that in "A Woman's Cry" we heard the painful wails of petty-bourgeois women, but there was no "cry" at all. So, how is this issue resolved in "Lipstick Market" when it is raised again? The development of the plot clearly tells us that when Li Cuifen's family finances are completely bankrupt, she runs out of her beautiful student life and becomes a saleswoman in a department store. She is insulted, ridiculed, or satirized by people, so in order to maintain her identity as a "pure and innocent girl," she is determined not to do it. However, the whip of life constantly whips her, and at the same time, inspired by Miss Yang, she still has to continue to struggle, so she picks tea, copies, and answers the phone, and she hopes to move towards a bright future in her own hard work. If the plot ends here, undoubtedly it has grasped reality and explained that so-called "equality between men and women" is just a lie in real society. That is, there is no way to solve the problem of women's liberation in real society. However, this play does not end like this. It actually enables Li Cuifen to save money in the bank from her extremely meager personal income, in addition to dealing with the daily expenses of a family of three, and finally even opens a foreign goods store, and the mother and daughter enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a work that praises real society, completely obliterating the current most serious economic panic, especially whitewashing the reality that the current national economy is almost completely bankrupt. Honestly, no one can believe that a female worker can actually save up. Using golden dreams to explain the future of working women, I think Mr. Ding Qianping, the screenwriter of "Torrent," would not dream like this.</p>
<p>Director Zhang Shichuan's progress can be seen in this film to some extent, at least more technically advanced than "Lovesickness". However, because he pays too much attention to the actors' expressions, I always feel that the dialogue and performance are not very connected. However, the shots are very good, especially a few close-ups.</p>
<p>The scenery in the clerk's residence is a failure, it should never be so gorgeous. The sound is still good. Some of the dialogues are very forced, and they are still the same sudden empty shouts of "darkness" and "light". The subtitles are very appropriate. The photography is also very good. Most of the actors are generally okay, but they are always too relaxed. On the whole, the technique is better among Chinese sound films, and it will not be too disappointing.</p>

<p>—康冰</p>
<p>"When I was in high school in Canada, many classmates planned to go boating on the weekend," Naoma Shearer said. "But the night before, I had a strange dream. I sank in the river, and my mother wanted to save me, but she also fell into the water. Fortunately, a stranger came and rescued us. This person had a very deep scar on the left side of his face. I woke up like this."</p>
<p>"The dream was very clear. I didn't close my eyes that night. The next morning, I felt it was not a good sign. My mother thought it was best to stay at home and not go boating."</p>
<p>"That afternoon they went boating, but I didn't go. Later, the wind and waves were very strong, and the boat hit a reef. Many friends fell into the river and became ill as a result. One of my closest girlfriends was very ill. Strangely enough, she also had the same nightmare as me on Thursday night, but she didn't care. What surprised me even more was that when the boat owner came to visit her, his face was exactly the same as the person I saw in my dream, with a very deep scar on the left side of his face."</p>

<p>"If that's the case, please rest assured. I will absolutely not obstruct my husband's will."</p>
<p>"That's very good, thank you." Martina was extremely happy. She seemed to have won a great victory, and walked out cheerfully. But before she could leave, John had already run in, panting. He came in and shouted "Mary" first! But Martina put on a very flattering pose, telling him that Mary had agreed to let him be free. John asked, "Free, let me be free?" He stared at Mary.</p>
<p>Martina said: "Yes, my love, you are free, you can marry me, isn't that good!" "Mary"! John shouted in a lost voice. But Mary stood still, silently looking at him. John turned back and grabbed Martina's arm, rebuking angrily: "What did you tell her? What nonsense are you talking? Tell me!"</p>
<p>"John, don't do this"! Mary softly advised her husband. John heard it. He immediately released Martina's arm and took a step back. Martina then said? "I told her you love me, you are willing to marry me, you want to be free, is all this nonsense?" Martina's eyes showed some arrogance. "It's all nonsense! These words, and many other words, are all lies I said"! The woman's attitude immediately changed, glaring at John angrily and said: "Okay, in front of your own wife, you are like this"! "Even if you call me to kneel before God, I will say the same thing. What I said to you was all nonsense when I was confused. We are breaking off relations from now on, it is over, it is gone."</p>
<p>Martina heard it, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on her back. She said angrily: "This is a righteous gentleman, and he still wants to be the governor of a province! Hmph, I can explain this matter. Do you know, it is not difficult for me to ruin your reputation." After she finished speaking, her eyes were full of murderous light, staring at John. "I know," Mary said calmly. "He knows it well." "Putting this story in the newspaper would be good news. I will make you unable to become governor!" Martina said, and turned back to Mary, "Mrs. Carton, you can keep your husband as much as you want, as long as you are willing to have him." "That's very good, thank you." Mary replied in Martina's tone a few minutes ago, in which there was endless meaning, causing different feelings in the hearts of the two women. Martina retreated. John opened the door, his face full of shame towards his beloved wife, but Mary did not blame him. She said that she had known about this matter a long time ago. She also knew her husband. Even when he was thousands of miles away, and was confused by the beauty of women, he had never forgotten his beloved wife at home for a moment. Saying this made John extremely grateful to her.
