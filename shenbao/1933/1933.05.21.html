<p>事後宋氏又發一單獨聲明與報界、其内容與公報所載大致相同、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）據美參議員畢德門言、世界金融領袖國行將在經濟會議提出之白銀計劃、僅主張廣用白銀爲通貨基本、而不建議複本位制、畢氏今日發表業經參加華府談話各國所同意之六項辦法、並稱此項計劃目的在安定與提高銀價、但觀於目下所同意者、足見各國寧願廣用白銀爲流通貨幣、並無堅持大行推廣其用途於通貨準備金之表示、六項辦法如下、（一）謀白銀之安定與復振、但當協定一確定價格、此事歸倫敦會議討論、（二）安定銀價必須與安定國際匯兌通盤調整、俾可予白銀一確定位置、（三）放棄減少貨幣内白銀成色與銷　銀幣之舉、（四）一俟可以實行時、立即恢復貨幣内原有白銀皮色（五）廣用白銀爲通貨基本、（六）撤除白銀關稅、及其他足以阻遏國際間白銀自由流通之障碍物、據稱以上六項將在經濟會議中大開辯論、惟僅爲提供討論之事項、將來或被擯棄、亦未可知、如其中最後一項、祗爲欲令産銀者滿意起見、故列入以備討論、逆料歐洲國家未必能同意、因有數國以爲自由流通後、將不免引起傾銷、即如美英法三國聞亦將不　持此層、因此國會領袖所抱締結一國際恊定立可復興銀業大增銀價之希望、現已漸見衰誠、蓋目下之白銀運動、祗能免其再跌、惟若減少産額與廣用爲輔幣後、將來當可有增價希望、預料將來倫敦會議中、意見必極紛歧、但信此後銀價當可微高於今日云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c27">天津之被擾亂 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 晦</p>
<p>平津空氣因日軍不斷進攻。而趨於緊張。蓋敵已渡過灤河西岸。直逼豐潤玉田。南越長城。襲我密雲。距故都不過百餘里矣。但自北平政分會委員長黄郛氏北行後。平津人心頓安。以爲永久和平縱不可必。而爭執中之諒解。則已有望也。不料事變之來。乃出乎一般預料之外。天津之被擾亂。突然發生於前夜。便衣暴徒三千。四出騷擾華界。刦奪警察槍械。亂投炸彈。當局縱萬分鎭靜應付。而一般社會。固已惶恐不安矣。同時日本飛機十一架。復飛窺北平領空。盤繞半小時始去。其命意所在。恐不止於示威耳。</p>
<p>天津之亂。據一般推測。恐未必就此中止。在表面上似爲出賣民族利益之漢奸。貪一時利祿。甘心爲虎作倀。乘火打刦其行爲之卑劣。居心之醜惡。誠爲狗彘之若。然其實彼輩所得。究竟何如。觀夫滿洲僞國之現狀。日人之橫暴。已可瞭然。敵方擾亂華北之陰謀。醞釀已非一日。其初僅欲借此搖惑國際視聽。破壞我國内地之秩序。以穩定其在東北三省之侵略。今者熱河旣被襲取席捲内蒙。又在旦夕實現。然猶恐我及時奮發。拚其最後之一擲。故彼朝夕聚謀。一面以重兵壓境。强力相迫。一面　極指使其工具。實現其第二傀儡之組織。變華北爲從前之「滿洲。」變今日之滿洲。爲以前之朝鮮。於是所謂「大陸政策。」得以實現。而對付遠隔太平洋之美國。與緊鄰「滿洲」之蘇聯。亦得有續持之實力。耐戰之資源。此其所以節節進逼。一意橫行而不已也。</p>
<p>據日人方面之說詞。屢以我國抗戰爲言。並怪我無誠意。其實我國自前年九一八事變發生。我國始終退讓。並未嘗積極抵抗。民間不平之鳴。抵貨之舉。蓋爲一種最低限最和平之表示。即我政府一切　日外交。亦皆萬分和平。孰能謂爲無誠意。乃日軍猶進攻不已。然則所謂誠意之有無。特種一侵略之「假詞一也。</p>
<p>吾人再論日方之誠意何如。東北禍變之初。彼固聲明將不侵略我國領土。今則何如。且由東三省而擴大至於熟河。在熱河未失守之前。彼日人又創爲不越長城之說。今則已攻多倫。襲密雲。奪灤州。益以擾亂天津市。飛機迫脅故都。其誠意又安在。况日方一面宣傳在諒解之下。互謀和平之道。同時西義一所部第八師團屬下第四及第十六兩個步兵旅團及騎兵第三旅團。附以野戰重砲隊。由密雲南襲順義。西侵懷柔。其欲剪斷平綏鐵路進迫平津之勢。並未稍减。又何嘗有絲毫停戰誠意之表示耶。</p>
<p>吾人鑒於目前危迫之形、勢震於天津之禍變。激於日軍之不斷進攻。皆須奮力自强。澈底認識日本之陰謀。目前縱能獲得一時之諒解。而决不可久。臥薪嘗胆。痛除以往偷安之惰習。當自今日始。</p>

<p>漢德森宣言和戰關鍵繫於軍縮</p>
<p>艾登認軍縮會議已達解决階段</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日午後軍縮會議因德國接受英國軍縮計畫、不獨認爲討論根據、且認爲將來軍縮公約基礎、故發生一種新氣象、軍縮會主席漢德森聞德代表那杜尼已由柏林抵日内瓦後、即召集總委員會會議、旁聽席幾無虛座、當時空氣頗爲緊張、漢德森發誠摯之詞、請各國進行軍縮工作、謂此後和戰問題、今由軍縮會决定、軍縮將爲脫離前世界經濟擾攘之第一眞正勝利、而在世界經濟會議將開時尤關重要云、</p>
<p>德代表那杜尼接受英國計畫爲將來公約基礎、謂德國所將提出之任何修正、必與此新態度相適合、以表示德國溫和精神、及願與他國和衷共濟以期嚮軍縮公約之實現、渠希望他國亦各竭其力、使其利益適合於英國計畫之範圍云、</p>
<p>英代表艾登歡迎那杜尼之言論、並謂渠在過去一週中與那杜尼之談話、未獲有光榮結果、但渠準備繼續討論、以期得較佳結果、當前之工作、現仍可怖、但軍縮會現已達有解决之階段、今日之會議、已大增軍縮成功之機會、渠代表英國歡迎美總統羅斯福之宣言、及其對於英相計畫之援助、按英首相麥唐納計畫、乃一種努力擬覓取全世界所可承認之基礎云、法代表瑪錫格里繼起發言、謂宣言時期今已過去、决議時期今已到矣、法美志願相同、殊可欣慰、那杜尼因希特勒之言論而能不附條件合作日内瓦事業、尤可歡迎云、最後由士外相魯斯度培博士發簡短之詞、歡迎美總統昭告世界之文、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　軍縮會議上午會議、並未發現何種新事實、僅由各國代表對於美國總統羅斯福·德國總理希特勒·曁那多爾尼宣言之一般見解、荷蘭代表魯特傑爾宣讀荷蘭女王致羅斯福總統之覆文、繼由芬蘭代表荷爾斯丁發言、謂軍縮會議現巳有一種新氣象、但要求對於海軍軍縮、應與小國以較大之自由權、瑞士代表穆塔挪威代表藍治亦提及羅斯福宣言、謂日内瓦局勢已因此而緩和云、繼而丹麥代表勃佳貝格宣言、謂羅斯福總統尊重各國疆界之提議、最可寳貴、最後則由比利時代表蒲爾根宣言、謂英國計畫係一切良善意志之結晶、並對於日内瓦之重見光明深致頌祝、據間接獲得之消息、德國代表擬將其十日前所提出之修正案大部分加以修正、尤以關於軍額問題、德國將提議與以五年期限俾依照英國計畫、以改變其軍制、關於軍器問題、德國幷不堅主獲得與現存攻擊軍備相類似之物、但要求各項攻擊軍備均限五年以内禁絕、此外幷要求對於軍備及軍額均應以平等權施諸德國、最後德國表示贊成軍備監察制度、其範圍愈廣大愈妙云、總委員會現已延會、至下星期一日與行政院會議同時開會、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　自德國代表那多尼宣布在原則上接受英國軍縮計畫之後、人心爲之稍慰、但各報均以爲軍縮公約、如欲其確實有效、須能包括所有國家而後可、若干報紙以爲遠東之事日趨緊張、欲求全世界之協調、其困難未有過於此日者、工黨機關報每日民聲報、謂談軍縮而忘日本、未免太荒謬、蓋日本現方擴充軍備不已、旣不願縮减、亦不願接受任何限制也、該報並謂日本確實有意在華北樹立一種與「滿洲國」相同之附庸國、幷在北平天津鼓動暗殺及恐怖行爲、以惹起恐慌、俾用爲出頭干涉之口實云（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>諸　先生前幾天接到青年會的那張通告，可眞使我發生難題了，因爲關於這個題目，已經有許多先生們講過好幾次，這回兄弟來講是最後的一次，要知道這末了一次是不很好說話的，差不多我要說的，他們幾位都講過了，恰巧我是逢到殿後，眞是我的運命不濟，幷且剛纔又吃了一點虧，就是王雲五先生本來要推我先講，那時我想姑且客氣一下，他如果再讓，我就可以占先講的光，不料他却不再同我推却了，所有我要想講的話，又被他統講了，那眞是吃虧不小啊，</p>
<p>不過這個題目是我見，而並不是你見更不是他見，那末想起來，我見者，一定是我個人的看法，和　人的見解，現在呢，我先來分作兩方，所謂知彼知己，先看日本那一面，兄弟從前却並未注意，雖則在社會服務有三十年之久，到日本有四次之多，可是僅不過考察教育，的確没有去看牠的政治經濟等各方面，直到前年春，兄弟到日本去，　不料無意中受到很大的刺激，因爲突然看到一般的境况，都是精神抖搬，非常振奮，口中談的人都是打算怎樣去打蘇聯，怎樣去打美國，幷且怎樣先掠奪我東北，征服中國，看去眞是其勢洶洶，不過兄弟那時聽到了，只當她是和我們中國人口裏呌着打倒帝國主義一樣地說說罷了，所以也並不十分措意，我在九一八未發生之前，寫了一本書，名呌黄海環游記，那裏料得到，我們　纔淡然忘却，不久，九一八就發生了，那時候，我深深地怪自己的不中用，責備自己的糊塗，旣然在日本知道了以上的情形，應該回來對當局者，用着二十四分的誠懇，或者甚至痛哭陳辭，促使大家注意，萬不該把牠認作唱高調看待，但是也料不到　有這樣的滔大大禍，會臨到我們的頭上的，自從九一八以後，那就是剛　王雲五先生所講的一二八，没有多久就繼續着來了，幷且還不但是一二八，還有山海關，南天門，熱河，灤東等等，所以他們的確不是空話，而眞是實在的做了，</p>
<p>我們現在，且不要去談日本，我們來說中國，不過有的人問我，說中國將來究竟什麽樣，我就回答他，你　什麽樣，就什麽樣，這一句並不是開玩笑，我可以舉幾個倒子，九一八事件，雖則是日本的處心積慮，然而也是張學良及一輩東北官吏要什麽樣才什麽樣，面目還不但是張學良等的不抵抗是要什麽樣就什麽權，卽東三省的人民也是要什麽樣就什麽樣，我們再說熱河，熱河我是去過的，不過去的時候，却還没有丢掉，我回來不久，就已把熱河丢掉了，但是諸位可知道，熱河是怎樣丢掉的，原來並不是日本兵來把湯玉麟打跑的，我們知道湯玉麟是熱河的主席，他平時非但不注意民生疾苦，反而剥削民衆，勒令老百姓種鴉片烟，公開製造　丸白麵，甚　使老百姓痛苦不堪，敵人來到　，也不願與湯玉麟合作了，所以日本軍隊能夠這樣不費力的剥奪熱河，也是湯玉麟不要熱河，他如　這熱河，也不至這樣　征暴歛，還有張作相等幾個將領，在起先　肯去，直到危機已迫纔去，當然是來不及，其實也就是大家不要熱河，所以熱河送給人家拿去了，以上種種過去的事實，都是要什麽樣就什麽樣，所以推測到未來的，也是要什麽樣就什麽樣，但是我的希望却是不要什麽樣，</p>
<p>今天兄弟所要貢獻的，就是有幾種心理，却是萬萬要不得，如果有了這幾種心理，一定就要什麽樣的，我有一個朋友，他的兒子在學校裏讀書，一天他回去見他的父親，就對他父親說，中國是没有辦法了，還是嘖牠亡了吧，他的父親責他不該這種說法，但他反說爸爸你不知道，現在中國的人，大都是没有愛國心的，他的父親說你不可這樣說法，就是個個是壞人，你一個也該要做好人，這個意思很對，因此大家該各各自勉，决不能因没有辦法而大家灰心的，還有人說，中國人還没有吃苦，至少要讓她們多多吃苦，國亡了然後纔有辦法，至於這個人的主張，當然比我朋友的兒要高明得多，大槪他是多讀歷史的，看到了歷史上的元朝，來侵略了中國，結果元朝同化了，到了清朝入關，結果也同化了，我們中國還仍舊是中國，不過我們知道這是歷史，决不該把現在相提並論的，我們要記得，在一千九百十九年的時候，朝鮮民族，乘開巴黎和平會的機會，想謀獨立運動，她們的民族精神實在可以欽佩，自從在三月二日示威之後，日本當局的對付朝鮮民衆，是慘殺，捕捉，眞是無所不用其極，有一處村落中，愛國份予多一點，竟然用兵包圍之後，屠殺殆盡，結果在二三月中，殺死了男子三萬餘，女子二千餘，監禁萬餘，犧牲如是之大，獨立仍未成功，可見國亡之後要來挽救，那是萬萬做不到的，所以中國如要保存這個國家，至少要在國未亡之前的。</p>
<p>今年的一月底，兄弟到過北方，看見張學良的措置太不好了，因此回來就對宋代院長說，現在北方的情形，危機日迫，政府如果要這華北，應當快救倒懸之急，諸君今天如已看過晚報，當可知道日軍已過灤河，所以中國如現在不救，那就不能救了。現在長江流域匪患甚熾，新疆亦發生糾紛，四川又將内戰，長此以往，中國將没有地方去掛這塊老牌子了，我們許多民衆，大家應當快起來，這塊牌子現在還未敲破，經快保護牌子纔好。</p>
<p>現在兄弟還有幾句話，貢獻給諸位，第一要鍜練體格，就是剛纔王雲五先生說的，德國不論男女老幼，都注意體　，雖則德國我是没有去過，不過現在知這德國是每家裝了無線電，在每天早晨聽口號操練身體，我們中國無綫電也有，但是大家無非聽聽小調，現在在　裏的諸位聽衆，都是優秀份子，如果到外面一看，醉生夢死，眞是廣敗到不堪設想了，第二就是我常常說的科學，我們試想爲什麽要被人「吃癟」，就是因爲没有科學的緣故，我們以徃大家應當努力，譬如小孩子也要敎他們一有知識就去研究科學纔好，現在我要對不起，很冒昧地把一位先生來做一下榜樣，究竟是誰呢，就是王雲五先生，他是商務書館的總經理，發明過四角檢字法，編過字典，又能操幾國的語言，又是一個科學家，他曾經在外國函授學校研究工程得到工程師的文憑，一二八後又埋頭　苦，硬幹復興　作，居然在短時期内商務印書館復興，倘使政府諸公　能照王先生這樣埋頭幹，國家的　，至少目前情形不致壤到如此地步。（本完）</p>

<p>天公格外作美、做出陣陣强笑、田徑塲上、點綴了多多少少的運動小姐公子們、四週的看臺上、也添上了較前天多一些的運動迷、中　也有五花八門的啦啦隊、也有美麗的姑娘、也有年輕的先生、</p>
<p>▲拚命拉京胡　北面　臺上一位穿着長衫的小先生、不知道他爲的什麽、坐在上面、擱起了脚、按命地拉着四皮倒板、自拉自唱、不亦樂乎、引得四周的看迷笑哈哈、眞是莫名其拉京胡也、</p>
<p>▲康彤愛畫片　康家兒女都是英雄、你看她們三個姊妹一同加入了角逐、而且每一位都是得到亮閃閃的奬牌、又其康彤小姐的一跳、在某一個時期、康彤小姐給我發覺了她愛小小畫片的小秘書、她　　的　了她妹妹手裏的五華牌畫片、急忙地藏到袋裏、同時對它一個笑、</p>
<p>▲隔塲殺喊聲　因爲天公不美、所以塲裏的觀衆寥寥、但是隔壁鄰居棒球塲上、給了像我們一般的老爺兵在作怪、所以便引動了好奇心的球迷、不知其數、頓時熱閙起來、老爺兵一跌倒、便是一塲殺喊聲、聲震吾耳、饒涎欲滴、</p>
<p>▲一束美的花　　　時期、一切緊　、所以這次大會、没有像中校聯合會那樣高麗、僅僅一隻小茅亭當作司令臺、臨時一隻小臺子、當作發奬臺　奬品也僅有三面旗、和六十三塊小奬牌、可是一束美麗的鮮花、却增加了不知多少的風光、鮮花不是落在兒女手、却是落到發奬女先生張婉清的胸膛前、這是可惜的、</p>

<p>時報勝民報丨二比零</p>
<p>▲老滕變作花斑豹　沈回春掏笛一鳴、時民兩隊二陳對圓、更不打話、滕樹殻撥球與任乃警向北進攻、陳靜肇阻擋不住、陸光杰邊陲起步、雲入罰球區域、吳中一咬緊牙關、斜刺裏殺出、滕樹榖武功出衆、一個倒栽葱跌得昏天黑地、雪白的褲子、泥濘塗滿、遙望之若南山之豹、</p>
<p>▲十二碼可改四碼　但雄心不死、幾度衝鋒、江紅蕉急忙昭後防將士、加緊嚴防、滕文公不得至楚國、唯有汗喘如牛、慨然嘆曰、英雄氣短、奈何奈何、未幾民報後衛、犯十二碼球、王孟年充當劊子手、不料球未動、而王先倒地總計該球離脚四碼左右、彼猶憤憤然對人言、如果犯四碼球則必得手、可惜無此先例、聞者莫不捧腹、</p>
<p>▲時報喜誕雙生子　下午時民報内防險象環生、吳中一大刀闊斧、殺人如麻、胡良成更拚命吃河豚、一交兩跌不在話下、無何老滕帶球深入、陳靜肇馬失前蹄、嘴兒堵泥、吳胡兩騎在外未回、高學國急出一身冷汗、撇下空門、迎門來搶、說時遲、老滕已經趕到、那時快、跌了一個作對成雙、蔣宗道漁翁得利、及時趕到、一撥進網、開球再戰、民報一軍憤怒、大舉反攻、江舡蕉時時在東路興風作浪、李庚西程昌濱關門閉戶、雷彼馥更左兼右顧、蔣宗道陸光述接濟三度南征、老滕球膽色天、深人不毛之地、砰然一脚、高學圃雖然摸着球皮、但已道入網、唯目瞪口呆、自嘆命苦而已、</p>
<p>▲晨報勝新聞丨一比零</p>
<p>晨報新聞之役、繼時民而起、晨報門神胡宗藩、腿傷未愈、爲衆人强拖上塲、有些兒板不下臉來、祇得忍創負重、學一隻駱駝、</p>
<p>▲新聞報失一良機　鼓角聲中、晨報金熙、撥球北伐、裴順元大吼一聲、嚇退敵人三百里、老將瞿越、東郊放馬、聲勢驚人、周夫明遙遙接應矮胖子、馬直山不善溜氷、跌一個七橫八豎、更能禮讓爲國、見球不踢、遂惱了雙槍陸文龍（詒）、和草上飛沈美鎭、聯絡邁進、俞德源悔　該在罰球區域之内、毛手毛脚、遂被罰十二碼、陳同松脚上無　、球越横柱飛去、</p>
<p>▲沈美鎭心雄萬夫　晨報同人、莫不額手、向天同聲慶祝、王遵武抖　精神、姚蘇鳳更以白巾蔽首、狠態可掬、兩度進窺、余空我手捧照妖鏡、皮球無處遁形、沈美鎭怒目如牛、屢衝屢陷、晨報後防畏之如虎、姚蘇鳳滿張鐵絲網、徐則　更密佈石灰瓶、饒你有霸王之勇、談也弗要談、王德馨見縫卽鑽、恰不防衝入新聞報禁地、對門力恊、蔣劍侯不慌不忙、迎之以足、蔣宗獲統率三軍、坌息即入晨報内地、沈美鎭張弓搭箭、胡宗藩撲地救出、</p>
<p>▲瞿越一脚定乾坤　馬直山頗稱努力、不獨常拉黄包車、並且兼能夾球出界、擾攘多時、休息時至、易地再戰、老馬出塲、任巡閱使、减掉笑料不少、你往我來、鋒芒相對、不分勝負、將近十分鐘之久、晨報前線將士、進迫極烈、周冀成雙拳不敵、瞿越覻一個空、脚起處球如矢發、蔣劍侯措手不及、紀錄遂開、此後新聞報雖努力反攻、但時間不許、鳴金收兵、</p>
<p>▲申報和時事丨一比一</p>
<p>和暖的陽光照遍了棒球塲、三千隻喜怒不同的面孔、一陣兒笑、一陣兒閙、蔣槐青夫人皺着柳眉說「滑得來」、原來槐青任守門之職、實在「滑」不得啊、</p>
<p>▲時事新三雙赤脚　前有馬華後衛余焯華赤足退敵、後有小妹妹梅洪畫效顰、勇則勇矣、然尙不及今之時事新三劍客也、前者雖云赤足、尙有球襪、今者一絲不掛、毫不搭假、主帥蔣湘青、先露其九尺圓膚、勢如奔馬、夏開明亦起而效尤、李卓眞學着門檻、與老蔣取一致行動、於是乎球迷們說、又像揷秧又像摸魚、實在還是踢球、眞的赤足、佔着不少便宜、脚脂頭朝下、是一雙特别的球鞋、保險不會摜交、所以老蔣奔起來格外迅速、</p>
<p>▲聶世琦先立一功　短兵相接、肉搏良久、兩重建樹、時事新前線、在老蔣統率之下、聯絡極見純熟、申報中防有大將謝宏在、此人善使十八般兵器、饒勇異常、第三道防線李尊庸、東擋西架、密不通風、球在中線、徘徊良久、蔣湘青帶球南下、連破三關、至相當地點、交給聶世琦、邁進幾步、力射入門、申報遂以一對○敗於上半時、</p>
<p>▲朱銘新還他顔色　申報中鋒孫道勝、本係沙塲老將、豈能甘居人下、不思抵抗、下半時激勵前線將士、破釜沉舟、不勝必死、謝宏運輪忙碌時事新後防人嘶馬吼、喊殺連天、蔣湘青招待來賓、十分週到、或握之以手、或投之以足、五分鐘後未露差地、但諺云「事不過三」過三方能無事曾幾何時、孫道勝義旗一舉、萬人嚮縣、陸爾强脚上擺渡、朱銘新得隙開刀、砍中要害、時事新雖不肯妥協、但環境逼人、終於簽字、</p>

<h3 id="c206">骰子的哲學 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>骰子，傳說是七步成章的曹子建的創作品；此說果確，骰子是第三世紀的産生物，離着現在大槪是在一千七百年左右。後來，到了唐朝，製造益工，鏤骨爲竅，朱墨雜塗；亦有巧翻花樣，取相恩紅豆子納人竅中，取其色明而易見，溫飛卿的艶詞道得好：玲瓏骰子安紅豆，人骨相思知也無？</p>
<p>根據上文的骰子出世史發明骰子的雖不能確定是曹子建，但，可以斷定是中國人的發明，不是西洋人的發明。然而，其中還有疑問，吾閱南海戴鴻慈九國游記，他到了丹麥國，參觀該國博物院，都是數千年來的古物；其中最奇的，就是刻石爲骰子，有一二三四五六的點數，其支配的位置，完全和中土相同。戴氏見了，頗疑中國故物，流傳此間；但，丹麥博物院長柏林肯堡氏ＢlinkＥnberg力辯其非。旣然力辯其非，那麽中西發明骰子，竟是不謀而合了。</p>
<p>骰子的點數和位置，頗和哲理相合，尤其和愛因斯坦的相對論可以互參，凡是最盛的反面，便是最衰；所以六數的反面便是么。不到最盛的地位，那麽反面也不會最衰；所以五數的反面便是二。僅僅稍盛一些，那麽反面也是僅僅稍衰一些；所以，西數的反面便是三。</p>
<p>貪心不足的賭鬼，連擲幾把骰子，點數大了還要大，擲了合六，還不足；擲了六五子五點，還不足，他一定要擲一個六的全盆，唉！盛到極點，也是衰到極點；可知道翻了轉來，究竟有多少點數？</p>
<h3 id="c207">朝奉的面孔 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>無産階級的窮朋友們，每月總有不少次數，光臨到窮人後門的當舖子裏去：而又衆口同聲的說；「朝奉的面孔，實在難看！」其實朝奉也是個人也有耳目口鼻，决不是青面撩牙猙獰可怕。可是窮朋友告訴我說：「他們的面孔，總是鐵板着：他們的言語，總是决絕著，你想難看不難看？任何店舖，任何賣買，决不有這種氣派。他們在商業中，可稱是特别區域。」</p>
<p>實在上海的朝奉面孔，還算好看些。因爲不論那條馬路上，五步一當十步一押，滿是便利窮人的後門開着。你如其東家不成，好到西家，所以朝奉們爲營業起見，决不十分難爲窮人。内地却不對了！往往一個城市中，一個鎭集上，祇有一二家。撳住了牛頭喝水，怕你逃到那裏去？所以朝奉的架子，益發好搭。他們上午九點鐘開門，下午四時收歇，好像銀行一般。有些門檻不精的窮朋友，在他們吃中飯時或當或贖，該是觸霉頭了，呌你耐心的等着。因爲他們吃飯，奉旨不會放下飯碗：便是吃好了，也要洗臉抽烟，挨了好一刻功夫，纔動手翻閱。不識相的朋友，倘是催促一聲，那祇有挨駡的份兒了。</p>
<p>想穿了一些不希奇。凡是有求於人，總須低首下心。當舖雖不是施捨機關，可是他是債主，你總向他要幾個錢，面孔的難看，是當然的事。其實世上像朝奉一般面孔的人眞多咧！惠難中的朋友，說起來總是有福同享，有難同當。等到一個得法了，一個還是尶𡯓着，於是得法朋友，一定也要放出朝奉般的面孔了。你得着了一個愛人，金銀像流水般化去，當然恩愛異常。等到床頭金盡，兩手空空，那時甜蜜的顔色，也會變成朝奉般的面孔了。此外像這類的事情也多着咧！</p>
<p>「由他簷下過，怎敢不低頭。」窮朋友們！不要抱怨朝奉的面孔難看，你不窮，怎會看得見這付尶𡯓面孔呢。</p>
<h3 id="c208">大出喪 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>一個人伸了腿子，没了氣，照舉世的定律，死者生前有功於世，我們當然追悼他一番，或是替他建造一點紀念物，以爲後世人羣的表率，不然的話，死者假使是一個極平常的人，他雖然死了，還不是和死了一個貓兒狗兒一樣，是不値得人注意的。</p>
<p>蹲在社會之舟上的人羣，尤其是一般富商，大賈，官僚，政客，守財奴，他一旦死了，爲子孫的，照理應替他的先人提出些資財出來，做一點社會公益事業，以留永久的紀念，無如中國人自私心極重，社會是社會，私人是私人，公衆的事情，與他們是漠不相關！</p>
<p>虛榮心籠罩在整個人類的頭上，我們國内所稱的一般孝子賢孫，他們很體會得到他的先人遺留的資財，在世旣不肯用之於社會，爲子孫的當然保留着爲自巳享用。</p>
<p>不過父母死了，欲表彰死者的名譽，及誇張自己的孝道，最榮耀最動人的，在他們意識裏，要算是大出喪最出風頭，在都市輪齒下旋轉着的死人的點綴裏，大出喪是一件極普徧，極尋常，極肯花費錢財的一件事情。</p>
<p>聯章冥器，紙牌執事，以及一切的一切擺上數里之遙，花費了幾千幾萬，爲子孫的總是心悅誠服，因爲這樣辦法，可以引起一時人羣的觀望，大衆的視聽，這種無意識的舉動，在地球外殻上黏附的人類，只有中國人肯去蠻管呆做，大出喪委實是中國社會一種病態心理的表示。</p>
<h3 id="c209">國魂！ <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>「人究竟是什麽東西？請你答我罷」！這是一位道貌岸然的老牧師，問我的話。原來在下是一個起碼的讀書人，因爲身弱多病，便喜歡瞧瞧佛老諸書，去研求其養身的方法。後來因爲朋友的紹介，認得幾位耶穌敎徒，對在下竭力揄揚他們「聖靈」「上帝」的恩賜。在下因爲想得些耶穌道理，便向那位老牧師請敎；豈知那位老牧師，劈頭先來問我這句話。</p>
<p>我回答老牧師道：「道家說「性」「命」，性是精神，命是肉體；導引服餌，是煆煉肉體，靜坐吐納，是修煉精神；所以人是「性」「命」兩物所合成的，益壽延年，必在這「性」「命」兩字上着手。佛家說靈魂和肉體合成一個人，肉體便是「地」「水」「風」「火」四大暫時結合；所以四大皆空，這個臭皮囊不久便化爲烏有。只有靈魂是不滅的，四生六道，便是有靈魂的明證。在下對於佛道之說，都很相信。我想：一個人的肉體，當然由於碳，鐵，燐，及有機化合物所合成：我們肉體的細胞，好像千千萬萬的電池；靈魂豈不是電子嗎？把種種元素和電子，合成便是一個人」。</p>
<p>那老牧師微笑道：非也；人是「靈」「魂」「體」三物所成的，上帝搏土爲人，吹氣爲魂，靈是最後賜予的。這個人能夠皈依上帝，受了浸禮，誓做好人，上帝方才賜給「靈」啊！在下聽了老牧師的話，不覺恍然大悟。試看我們貴國人，在這「國亡臨頭」的日子，關東淪亡，華北烽烟，可是南朝金粉，酣歌妙舞，游魂飄盪，正樂得色授魂與，魂不附體，難道這種情况，便是我中華民國的「國魂」嗎！目下平津危在旦夕，華北淪胥，固意中事，何待白楊蕭蕭之夜，我江南難道便没有孤魂寃鬼嗎？上帝啊！快把「靈」賜給中國人吧！亞門。</p>

<p>第七回　數語絕恩情閉門痛哭　一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>不料積之的行踪，大爲變更了，直到五點鐘的時候，還不見他回來。冬日天短。到了五點鐘，天色已經漆黑了，老姑娘縱然有那靜等的决心，可是時間上也不許可他。所以他連等兩天，都是垂頭喪氣的走回去了。到了十日之後，他有些不耐煩了，等着甘家一個女僕出來買東西的時候，兩下相遇着，他就笑道：王媽，去年你和我作了不少的事，大年下，我也没有給你錢花，實在對不住。說着，在身上　出兩張毛錢票，就塞到王媽手裏，笑道：我也没有什麽東西送你，你别嫌少，拿去買一包茶葉喝罷。王媽無原無故接了他幾張毛票，倒不知人家命意之所在，可是人家給錢，總是好事，　着向桂枝請了一個安，連聲道謝。桂枝笑道：你們家那些口子，上上下下，就是你一個人，也眞虧着你忙呵！王媽道：作慣了，倒也没有什麽，我很自在的。桂枝道：你們老爺常在家嗎？王媽道：老爺總有大半天不在家的。桂枝裝出很自然的樣子，一點也不猶豫，向王媽問道：你們二爺呢？也是大半天不在家嗎？王媽聽到他提上了二爺，向他臉上望着一笑，他眼睛下的魚尾紋，皺着疊上了幾多層。笑道：大姑娘，我和你說兩句話，你可别生氣。桂枝聽了這話，心房就卜通跳了一下。然而他的態度，却依然很是鎭靜。笑道：你二爺的事，我生什麽氣呢？王媽看他很不在意，就把老爺回來，如何和太太議論，議論之後，太太如何勸老爺，如何老爺告訴太太，把話來嚇二爺，如何二爺認錯，要和老姑娘斷絕來往。一頭一尾，詳詳細細的，向桂枝告訴了。桂枝聽了這些話，只氣得臉上紅一障子，青一陣子却笑道：那是你們老爺太太多心。我一個大姑娘家，要和爺們來往些什麽。這話就是這樣一說一了，以後你可别跟别人說了。（七六）</p>

<p>諸君，今天我有很重　的幾句話，這幾句話，是有名的兒意心理學家，在幼稚園裏實騐而得的，所以做父母的人，千萬要注意子女的性質如何，在家庭敎育中，可以想法子補救的，譬如小孩們的玩具，我們以爲平平常常的東西，總敎出錢去買來給他玩賞，不管什麽好壞，不知道那一種玩具，是合那一種小孩性質的，可是幼稚時期的小孩們，尤其是知識漸開的時期，最宜注意他的性質如何，若是明白他的性質，慢慢的陶冶他，感化他，那末就可以使他原有的劣性，逐漸改革，他方把他缺陷的毛病，也可以補救了，現在我把各種性質的小孩，應給他如何的玩具，簡單的說明一下：</p>
<p>（一）神經質的兒童，須給他園藝傢伙，噴水器，木馬，球，喇叭，大鼓，電車等玩具。</p>
<p>（二）不沉靜的兒童，須給他畫册，折紙細工，切紙手工，綳線游戲，七巧板等。</p>
<p>（三）少獨立心的兒童，須給他粘土手工，解環游戲，綳線游戲等玩具。</p>
<p>（四）乏忍耐力的兒童，須給他豆細工，園藝具，解環游戲，釣魚傢伙，圖畫範本，等玩具。</p>
<p>（五）無始末心的兒童，須給他縫紉傢伙，廚房傢伙，粘土細工，圖畫範木等玩具。</p>
<p>（六）懦怯的兒童，須給他木馬，秋千，踏高蹺，脚踏車跳高，跳遠等游戲。</p>
<p>（七）有殘忍性的兒童，須給他動物玩具，蟲，鳥獸的生物，鮮花，神佛塑像等玩具。</p>
<p>（八）不愛多朋友的兒童，須給他幻燈，迴旋輪游戲，羅漢偶像，以及成羣結隊的玩具。</p>
<p>（九）刁詐狡猾的兒童，須給他神佛慈悲的偶像等游戲。</p>

<p>從前，在意大利某村莊，有一家眼鏡店，這眼鏡店的小夥計，常常玩弄凸凹鏡，他覺得很有興趣，有時候用兩手各拿一面凸凹鏡，重疊的細看，似乎比看一面時，看見外面的東西，比較爲近一些。這小夥計發見後，呌店中的夥計，大家來看，果然一點不錯，這時候閙得隔壁鄰舍，都來爭看了。有一位有名的大學者，呌做加里阿，凑巧當他們喧閙的時候，路過門前，他不知他們聚在一塊兒，奪來奪去看點什麽東西，也搶上來看一看，說：「你的凸凹鏡有什麽花樣，可以借給我看嗎？」那小夥計面帶着得意的笑容，送給他看了，果然把凸凹鏡用兩手在前而移動細看，兩面鏡距離若是遠時，可以看到遠處的東西，漸漸移近，因此，那加里阿歸家後，專心研究其中的道理，結果，把凸鏡放在筒内，做得可以伸縮，就發明了望遠鏡。</p>

<p>（答）王兒到了十五歲時，他的父親是四十五歲，正合王兒年齡的三倍了。</p>

<p>（答）一共賺了二十元，每罎賺一元。</p>

<p>— 應平丹</p>
<p>不論是應酬，或是做文章，除了主人之外，總有一個「陪客」，因爲有了陪客，才覺得熱鬧，生動，否則，就會冷清清地鼓不起興趣。</p>
<p>一有錢者出錢；有力者出力」，我們單從他的表面看來，出錢是爲的救國；出力也是爲的救國。若拿眼前的現勢而論：出錢出力，不特一般是爲的救國，而且是有相等的很急迫的需要，因爲，器械缺乏，固然是要錢。同時，兵力單薄，尤其是要力。實則，這種見識，還是没有悟解得做文章者的苦心深意，如果你悟解了後，一定知道：「有錢者出錢，是主；「有力得出力」，是賓。因爲要錢是正面文章，而要力却是信筆寫來，不是文中的主要意思。</p>

<p>丨農村生活素描</p>
<p>剷子不住的剷着，嚓嚓嚓的，和着鍋子裏的芥菜麗麗拉拉地呌響。</p>
<p>沈大娘，披散着頭鬚，髮絲黏住在淌着油汗的額角上面。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦，燒旺些呀。」她擱下剷子，朝着竈肚門喊着，用袖口揩着額上的汗。</p>
<p>没有答應。燒火的丨癩頭阿狗蜷伏在竈肚門口，學着一個裁縫的樣子，伏着在那里，他在那里胡的胡的吹火。可是硬豆其一時還燃不起來。阿狗匆匆的想要找尋火柴，不料竈肚裏　意外的鑽出一股白烟來，轟的一亮，豆殼剥剥的爆着，火肝了；火舌頭捲到竈肚門外，捲着捲着，癩頭阿狗新剃的光癩頭，和一張顔色黑黑的臉子，給火舌頭映得滿紅　，而且灼灼地，發亮。</p>
<p>鍋子裏又呌着，麗麗拉拉地。</p>
<p>嚓嚓嚓！剷子不住的剷着。沈大娘，頭臉没在青汽裏，撅着小嘴唇，眼睛縐着，而且全然給淚水蒙着了。</p>
<p>「小鬼！」她忍不住要跥着脚　了起來：「不旺時不旺，旺時又一齊旺了。」</p>
<p>阿狗依然没聲没響的，挾着一大塊冷灰壓到旺火上去。</p>
<p>沈大娘，熟練地，加糖，加醬油，加酒，蓋上鑊蓋。</p>
<p>可是另一個鑊蓋又揭開了。嘟嘟的白汽飛着，飛着，肉香散布得滿廚房。望着鍋裏的肉塊，她，沈大娘，心裏記着婆婆的叮嚀：</p>
<p>丨肉是多燒不得的，不然就没有塊頭啦。這些奴才，都揀塊頭大的朝碗裏拖，也不是吃好食的東西……肉價這麽貴，而且還扎水……咱們再不能把塊頭切得大些嘍。現在種田也太難啦！……</p>
<p>可是，今天的肉塊就燒得太過火了。丨阿狗小鬼，和着這個小鬼燒飯，是老娘的倒霉啦。丨她心裏怪怨着</p>
<p>丨一，二，三，四：一，二，三，……每人四塊，三十二塊一碗，……</p>
<p>沈大娘，心裏數着，把肉塊裝配得滿滿的三大碗。</p>
<p>芥菜　鑊蓋又揭開了。剷起一些菜湯，凑到唇邊吹吹氣，呷了一口，抿抿嘴唇，縐縐眉心：</p>
<p>丨太淡啦。</p>
<p>喃喃的說着，抓起一把鹽，投向鍋子裏去。　在竈面上，銅杓，剷子，　瓶，揩竈布，菜碗……胡亂地放着。</p>
<p>丨鹹菜湯，豆芽，芥菜，肉，四個全啦。她敝着竈上的菜碗：「阿狗小鬼！」尖聲的喊，「坐着舒服嗎？快些打酒，把菜碗搬出去，田事就要回來吃飯啦。」</p>
<p>沈大娘，急匆匆地，把竈面匀出一個位置，提過一隻飯籃放下，揭去飯鑊蓋，又從刀架上抽下一柄剷子，把白飯和着麥牺打到籃裏去。　蒸在飯的熱氣裏的臉上，這時才露出了笑容：</p>
<p>丨好啦，只等田裏回來吃飯啦。</p>
<p>她輕輕吐了口氣。</p>

<p>又是麥穗長到半個人高的時候。小狗子牛也不放，迎着快落山的太陽，呆呆地站在麥隴上。</p>
<p>他知道小巧兒每天這時要打他的田頭經過，因爲這該是小巧兒從田裏回去的時候。他想這番不放這小蹄子跑掉，每回她浪上人火來，又一滑手逃走了，遠遠地括着臉笑人家。</p>
<p>小巧兒果然踏着自家的長影子來了，她笑着和小狗子招呼。小狗子從麥隴上跟了上去，小狗子唱起歌來。</p>
<p>巧姑娘的頭賽洋樓，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的脚賽牛角，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的手賽饅頭，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的腰賽蒲包，………</p>
<p>小巧兒駡他：「你嚼舌頭，你駡你姑奶奶……」小狗子笑了，他不回答，他還是跟着唱下去。</p>
<p>巧姑娘的背脊賽百頁，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的肩膊賽皂角，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的眼睛賽曉星，</p>
<p>巧姑娘的奶子賽………</p>
<p>小巧兒說：「我打你，撕你扣嘴，」她回過身來揪他的小辮子，他一伸手摸着她的胸膛，手一滑更向底下來了。小巧兒可急了，揪住了他的辮子和他打架，他抱住了她的腰，兩個從麥隴上一滾滾到麥窠裏去了。</p>
<p>太陽已經沈了下去，幕色蒼茫罩着大地。晚風過處，麥穗像水波似底蕩漾着。有幾撮急促顫動的麥穗，也慢慢底被黑暗隱蔽了。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>第二天早晨，露水還没有乾，小狗子跟着他爸爸走過這條麥隴。他爸爸發現了麥田裏睡倒了一堆麥，「螞螞的，」他駡，「又是那個小雜種，没娘没老子的，没處去快活，快活到老子麥田裏來了。小狗子去扶起來。」</p>
<p>小狗子紅着臉，一聲不響底去理好睏倒了的麥根。他想起了小巧兒，想起昨天傍晚在這地方的一切，他又迷糊了。</p>
<p>「發什麽呆，還不快走！」爸爸把小狗子怒吼着。老年人怎會　少年人的心思呢？</p>

<p>（三十一）放屁文學</p>
<p>日人福富織部著「屁」一書，集錄關於屁之一切文獻，長至二十萬言，内含最重要者，有屁之科學，古今屁之名人，平賀源内之傑作（放屁論曲屁考）屁之悲喜劇，以及於屁有關之傳說童話笑語狂歌等，可謂集放屁文學之大成，允稱古今獨步者矣。國内學者移譯日籍至多，獨缺此書，是一憾事，然有吳稚暉先生之文章代之，或亦可以無憾矣乎？吳先生於「我們所請願於章士釗先生者」一文中·自述三十一歲時·自北京回家·一在小書攤上，得到一部豈有此理，他　頭便說，放屁放屁，眞正豈　此理。忽然大澈大悟，决計薄文人而不爲。偶涉　，　以放屁放屁眞正豈有此理之精神行之。…却有一位　鈍店裏的小夥計，在上海醫學書局做校對，借了七百圓，把我撒在報章離誌上的狗屁，還搜到三十年前的書院課藝，刻什麽一部文存，眞要命。……」可知吳先生行文，自謂爲「放屁」，且爲「狗屁」而非人屁。饒有自知之聰明，足　作家之誇大，正此老萬萬不可及處。無奈國人不懂幽默，博士學者視吳先生爲中國近三百年來幾大思想家之一，革命同志則視吳先生爲黨中理論家，新聞記者且强邀吳先生談話作文，此正吳先生所謂「眞要命」者也。劉復博士嘗標點豈有此理（即何典）一書行世，推爲吳先生作文之老師，雖生財之有道，亦放屁之無理者矣。元蔣正子山房隨筆，記三山林觀過七歲，嬉遊市中，以鬻計自命。或戲令詠轉矢氣，詩云：</p>

<p>不啻若自其口出，</p>
<p>人皆掩鼻而過之。</p>
<p>所謂轉矢氣，他書或作轉失氣，非是。矢漢書作屎，古屎矢相通。矢氣者屁，乃矢之氣也、轉爲動詞，與放同性。醫書所云下焦洒氣，即屬此氣，稍科學化而言之，可云自腸胃排出之臭瓦斯。若云爲屁，言不雅馴，洋服紳士，高等華人似難言之也。林觀過轉矢氣一詩，題似濁氣，詞則文雅，此放屁文章之最佳者。林觀過爲神童，而吳稚暉先生可云聖老，劉復先生則固堂堂博士，予論放屁，而得仰攀及之，與有榮焉。</p>

<p>來回（續）</p>
<p>隨後她在他的額頭上吻了一下，爲的是免得他嫉妒。</p>
<p>假期的到來，使得紅蘿蔔鬚那樣高興，他竟因此流起淚來。他是常常這樣的；他常常把他的感情表現錯了。</p>
<p>開學的那天（開學的日期是十月二日星期一早晨；從聖靈彌撒開始），雷辟克家的老遠地聽着公共馬車的鈴聲時，便彎下身把她的孩子們一把抱住。紅蘿蔔鬚却不在這一抱之内。他熱誠地希望輪到他身上來，手已經伸向馬車上面的皮帶，告别的話早已預備好，他凄切到連說話的聲音都變了。</p>
<p>「再會，我的母親，」他裝着懍然的神情說。</p>
<p>「嘿，你究竟把我看做什麽人啦，你這丑角？」雷辟克家的說，「你像别人一樣呌我一聲「媽媽」便會虧了本去嗎？有誰見過這樣的事情呢？乳臭未乾的孩子就會裝模作樣啦，這才眞是希奇啊！」</p>
<p>但她仍在他的額頭上吻了一下，免得他嫉妒。</p>
<p>鋼筆</p>
<p>雷辟克把大哥菲利克斯和紅蘿蔔鬚送去住讀的那個聖瑪克書院，裏面的學生是在公立中學上課的。他們每天要做四回相同的散步。在春秋佳日，這散步是非常愉快的事；就是下雨的日子，因爲距離狠近的緣故，那些少年們也祗會感着凉爽而不會被雨淋濕的。所以這種散步一年到頭都是狠有益於身體的事情。</p>
<p>這天早上他們又從中學上課回來，綿羊似的慢慢走着，低頭向前的紅蘿蔔鬚怱然聽見有人說：</p>
<p>「紅蘿蔔鬚，你看你父親在那邊！」</p>
<p>雷辟克就歡喜這樣使得他的孩子們吃驚的。他來到之前，並不寫信通知他們，他讓他們突然見到他，立在對面街角行人道上，兩手放在背後，嘴裏啣着一支紙烟。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚和大哥菲利克斯從隊伍裏面跳出來同他們的父親跑去。</p>
<p>「眞的！」紅蘿蔔鬚說，一我雖在想着什麽人，可並不是想着你的。」</p>
<p>「你除非看見我時是不會想到我的，」雷辟克說。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚想回答幾句親熱的話、但他那樣忙着，什麽話也想不起來。他用脚尖頂立起來，想抱吻他　父親。第一次他的嘴唇觸着了他的鬍鬚。可是雷辟克好像有意避開一樣，機械般地把頭抬起。隨後他彎下身來重又縮回去，想要把嘴唇吻在他頰上的紅蘿蔔鬚又没有吻到。他祗碰着他的鼻子。他吻落了空。他不再强求，可是心裏覺得奇怪，不知道父親爲什麽會這樣對待他。</p>
<p>「難道爸爸不喜歡我了嗎？」他心裏想。「我看見他抱吻大哥菲利克斯的。他讓他抱吻，他並没有避開。爲什麽他躱避我呢？難道他想使得我嫉妒嗎？我常是覺得祗要三個月不看見我的雙親，便非常想看見他們。我早就準備像一隻小狗一樣跳在他們的頸上。我們相互地儘量享受着對方的愛撫。可是一見到他們，便使我冷了半截。」</p>
<p>因爲只願黯然地想着這些事情，紅蘿蔔鬚對於雷辟克的問話都没有好好回答了，這時雷辟克問他希臘文有没有一點兒進步。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨這要看是指那一方面。把希臘文譯成法文比較把法文譯成希臘文要有進步。因爲把希臘文譯成法文時，我們可以猜着一些意思。（未完）</p>

<p>— 樸</p>
<p>近有人說：「中國大多數民衆，對於國家觀念很小很小，加以近年來一般的風氣是盲從的崇尙外國人的聲色貨制，對於中國原有的除了北平的古董外均不大爲人所愛惜與保護。在這種心理下，所以中國這個民族，勢必須經過一次亡國的痛苦，不然，恐怕不很容易能夠「及時」興起」。這種論調，自不失爲一種沉痛傷心的批評，但是我們所要注意的就是經過亡國痛苦後的「興起」又豈是容易的事嗎？</p>
<p>據日前日本各報所載的韓人復國運動消息丨大阪築港警署之官警約三十名，於最近搜查港區海運業韓人張士遠宅，捕去東亞通航組合長玄吉英，濟州島航路伏木丸事務長金仁東及貨物部長申元湜等四十名，並有少女兩人在内，由大阪府特種刑事高等科審訊，判明玄吉英等諸人有復國運動的組織，東亞通航組合即其組合機關。查東亞通航組合於十三年前由韓僑集資設立，以家鄕人乘家鄕船爲號召，購入伏木丸，組織船公司，現有組合員約五百餘人，近乘每月一號及十六號大阪碼頭最爲擁擠的機會，散布各種復興韓國的激烈傳單，因此遂引起警局中人的注意，嚴爲戒備，最近乃檢舉。</p>
<p>近年來，我們不時聽見日人破獲韓人復國運動機關的消息，每一次的破獲，總有若干韓國愛國志士的流血與犧牲丨這種前仆後繼的復國運動，實在令我們發生無限的感慨與憂愧，想到當年日人亡韓的情形是如何的容易，而今日韓人冀圖復國又是如何的不容易，這確是一班充滿苟安心理而尙未做亡國奴的國人們所應當深切反省的事實。</p>

<p>— 顔梅莊</p>
<p>警察</p>
<p>我是一個曾受過中等敎育的青年，一個弱不禁風，手無縛雞之力的智識分子，可是我現在居然跑到×地去當警察，把筆桿換上槍桿了</p>
<p>我們的派出所是設在一座廟宇裏，當我第一次被領到這個地方來時，那三隻眼睛的娘娘便用謙遜的微笑歡迎我。廟名是找不到，祗見上面的一塊招牌，飛揚跋扈地寫着「陰陽福地」四個字，這使我凛然地聯想到這是生與死的邊沿。廟裏盡是娘娘和小鬼，空氣中充滿了溫柔與横蠻的不調和的情調。牆壁上塗滿着帶有謎氣的圖畫：一隻大尾把，尖嘴巴，小眼睛，渾身是毛的老虎；一個和尙，頭上爬着一條狗；一個人肚臍上長出一個頭；一個穿着破鞋子發獃似的漢子，嘴裏跑出一隻雀子來：一切都令人感到生命之神秘與憂鬱丨</p>
<p>所裏有七個人，一個巡長，一個伙夫，兩個門崗，三個街崗。巡長，伙夫，還有一個弟兄，都是當地人；其餘：一個廣西人，兩個直隷人，一個湖北人。巡長，是個大塊頭，眉粗眼大，看起來像是一個肉做的開山大斧；可是他說話的聲音却像一面敲不響的破鑼。伙夫，絕對相反，瘦得像一根蘆葦，終日地咬着牙齒不開口，好像賭過永不說話的咒一樣。另外一個，那是一個沈湎於糟麯的酒徒，秃頭頂，紅的面孔上不時的冒着蒸氣，嘴裏模糊不清的毒駡，一見便知道是一個燒酒浸透的貨色。那四個外鄕人，一樣都是身村高大，形容枯槁。他們，都是些樂守田園，自給自足的農人，歷史的暴風捲得他們離鄕背井，終於，沉澱在這荒凉的一隅中了。生命無言地消逝，他們沉默地在飢餓與死亡的邊沿宛轉着。在平常，他們好像是若無其事的：大聲地笑着，滿地的吐痰，興奮地談着别人家「娘子」的倘和尙。可是當某個人不當心的提起「老家」「爺娘」「老小」等字樣的時候，他們便立刻安靜了；而且，衰老了，軟弱了：頭低埀下來，兩手抱着膝，把下巴擱在上面，沉默地注視着地面，憂傷使他們窒息了！</p>
<p>晚上，因爲别的弟兄們睡的地方擠不下了，我便睡在大殿上，找到兩漲高低不同的癆病桌子來代替床。肥胖的巡長慈悲的爲我找到一條破褥子，那藍黑色的布面上佈滿了塵垢和油膩，深暗的破洞裏面放溢着悶鬱的臭氣，而且好像有無數的毛蟲在裏面蠕動似的。大殿是空漠而寥闊，堆積着石灰和破瓦，充滿了潮濕，泥土，朽木的氣息，暗示出衰亡和疾病。神像前，留戀地停滯着香灰和燭淚，好似一個無助的老婦，傷心地流她無盡的眼淚。</p>
<p>黑暗從窗格的孔裏紆曲地爬進來，塡滿了大殿，於是長明燈便悠緩地發出黯淡的光燄丨丨在白天牠永久是不露聲色的。神像前的飄帶丨爲蛛網灰塵所凝結丨在空氣中發出幽微的歎息，怨恨牠永久的閒散和寂寞。</p>
<p>我的床面前有兩位娘娘，兩位大尊，八個小鬼。娘娘一向是帶着溫良的微笑；天尊則富有小資産階級的傷感情緒，悲哀地歎息着他們威嚴的中落。至於那班小鬼，他們都是一樣地手拿毛竹板，頭揷野雞毛，滿臉橫肉，一身流氓氣；滿帶邪氣地注視着面前那妨碍他們行動的短欄干，表示出他們無窮的憤怒。</p>
<p>陰風冷峭地從窗格孔裏吹進，長明燈的光燄便懨懨欲睡。老耗子，小耗子成羣的滿地亂跑，到處呌着嗅着。空氣中，寒冷像一個不見形影的鬼怪，鑽進破被來侵襲我的身體，體溫很快的被牠吸吮了。</p>
<p>大殿上的光線稀薄得好像地獄，黑暗的精靈到處爬行，壁畫鬼影一般地浮動起來，空氣的混濁使人窒息。我是被怎樣一個離奇的命運抛擲到這個「福地」來享樂，我睡在高低不平的床上不禁大笑起來。</p>

<p>— 恒淵</p>
<p>在資本主義的經濟極度恐慌之下，爲得挽救經濟上的危機與衰退，必須要有新的爲增進經濟能率而提供的較高的技術及計劃的理解與應用，以免除過去經濟上的種種浪費，使它回轉到復興的地位。因此，科學管理就成了一種必然的産物，首爲美國鐵廠技師台拉（Ｔaylor）所提倡，後經許多政治家實業家和銀行家的研究，乃逐漸流行而見諸實施。迨由英德等國的相繼襲用，遂成了整個資本主義世界經濟上風行一時的一個救星。科學管理旣成爲整個資本主義經濟上的重要因素，它的意義的重要，也就可想而知。依照一般的說法，科學管理是一種助長經濟性向上的技術與計劃的應用。其目的在於改善貨物的品質，增多貨物的數量，減低貨物的成本與價格，以充實國民經濟的福利，所以它是一種經濟的進步的和機能的東西。</p>
<p>在資本主義的各國，大體上說來，科學管理的第一個問題是集中資本，也就是所謂聯合運動。聯合的方法分爲豎的與橫的二種。豎的是在於生産方法相關的組織的聯合，從採取原料至製成物品爲止，聯成爲一系統。橫的是生産性質相同的組織的聯合，即凡同業的生産機關，聯合起來，以此减少消耗浪費，增高生産的能率，而求得多量的利潤。它的第二個問題是生産方法的標準化，其第一步是在一公司中辦理，第二步依區域對於特種産業由新狄加辦理，第三步以全國爲範圍，不分産業性質，而依康特恩辦理，至第四步乃由國際間共設一國際標準協會。目的在於（一）以最小的努力，得到勞動最大的効率，（二）以减少各種不同式樣物品爲依歸（式樣不同而又無明顯利益者），研究製造方法，（三）除去原料與動力之消耗，（四）使商品之分配趨於簡易，（五）除去非必要的運輸，過量的財務負担，及無用的多數居間人。依此可使（一）社會方面，生活標準提高，安定增加，（二）消耗方面，價格减低，貨色更合於需要，（三）生産者方面，可公平分配生産並得其利益，使與集中資本，相輔並行。</p>
<p>但是資本主義的科學管理的結果，依照近數年的國際經濟形勢看來，並没有解除資本主義的危機。據伐爾加氏的研究，至少是國際的經濟競爭，並未因國際科學管理化而减低少許，且因物價指數的跌落，資本的利潤，依然臺無成績，更不得不於國内减低工資與裁减工人，於是勞動者實質工資日益跌落，失業人數日益增加。另一方面，又增强了勞動者疾病與災害，而必然的引起勞動者壽命一般的縮短和勞動能力期間的縮小。因此大部份勞動者的生活日益低下，便低減了大多數的購買力，使國内市塲的販路更加困難，形成了生産過剩的現象。且資本集中以後，利用國内外的獨佔，在生産費明明低減的時候，也並不低减價格，却把價格保持至同一水準，藉此來增加牠的利潤。所謂科學管理的運動過程，實在是充滿着深刻的茅盾。</p>
<p>然而科學管理的現代形態，也决不是偶然的，它是資本主義的生産一切傾向之論理的發展，而且是最明白的現象形態。這不用說，它是資本主義發　最後的表現，資本主義没落瓦解期的一個特徴。</p>
<p>總之，科學管理的本身，仍然是一種貨獻社會哲理，原則，以及合宜的基本技術，並不見因資本主義的應用帶到相反的結果而有損其價値。一旦産業管理權由資本家轉移到全體勞動者之手，它無疑地是要發揮其最大限度的効能，而求得全人類的幸福的。</p>

<p>— 李培林</p>
<p>這天吃午飯的時候，小菜還没搬出來，我先佔坐在桌子的上橫頭，哼看四郎探母。妹妹坐在我的下手，她鼓起嘴巴，把筷銜在口裏，輪着牙齒格格的作響。她是在和我鬭氣，因爲我不肯把我在學校裏做手工揑成的泥娃給她玩。但一忽兒我們便和好了，爲的是母親遲遲的不從廚房裏走出來，我和妹妹便比賽着誰用筷子把湯匙敲得響，算誰本領大，直待母親捧了菜碗出來。</p>
<p>我們正在吃飯，表哥急怱怱地從外面跑了出來，他的來意我是明白的，不過不等他說出來，我還希望他說的話不會給我猜着，但他終於把我不希望他說的話對母親說了：</p>
<p>「我給表弟荐的那家錢莊，後天就要接財神了，表弟明天準得進去。那家錢莊是元字號的挑打，資本有五萬，飯每頓要開六桌！」</p>
<p>他說這兩句話，似乎把全身的力量都使出來了。接着，他說：「他們那麽大的範圍，茶房一定用了好幾個，表弟進去或者不必倒痰盂。」</p>
<p>「那麽，下半天我不用到學校裏去了嗎？」我放掉筷子，膛目視母親。</p>
<p>「學校裏表弟本來老早可以不要去，」表哥說，「這樣，明天早上八點半，準由我來陪表弟進店，你們先得把舖蓋行李預備好，還有，不要忘了買一副香燭，那是拜先生要用的，表弟的先生是那家錢莊的副當。」</p>
<p>表哥坐了一會就走了，屋子裏靜悄悄地剩下我們三個人，都不作聲。我再也没心喫那剩下的半碗飯。妹妹雖不懂事，面孔上也顯得很憂鬱，但過了一會她却說：</p>
<p>「哥哥，你明天要去學生意，那個泥囡囡用不着了，送給我可好？」</p>
<p>我點點頭。母親始終不響，祗是把潮潤的淚跟對我上下週身細細地打量。一種莫可名狀的悽愴的情緒逼迫着我的心頭丨素來個性很强的我，竟不由自主地倒在母親的懷裏哭了。</p>
<p>「好孩子，」母親摩摩我的頭髮說；「快不要這樣，人大了，應該好好地做些大人模樣出來，怎麽聽見了要去學生意，反而哭起來呢？剛纔表哥不是說過嗎？那家錢莊很大，你進去一準不會吃苦。孩子，三年功夫是很快的，等你學出了生意，媽媽在這裏等着你賺了元寳回來呢。」</p>
<p>我仰起頭來望望母親的臉，她裝着不自然的笑容，把手指划划我的面驉，說：</p>
<p>「十五歲的人，還要躱在媽媽懷裏作腔，怪不怕羞的。」</p>
<p>但她的兩眼，貯着比我更多的淚水。我咽了一口涎水，我的心一陣酸，淚水愈發像瀑布似的滾流出來。我記得很清楚，自從父親死後，我從來没有這樣傷心的哭過。可是，假使父親當時還不曾死，我那裏會被逼去做人家的學生子，又那裏會來今天的這頓痛哭呢？寫到這裏，父親溫和的面貌不禁又浮現在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>晚餐是那樣地在悲慘的空氣的籠罩下草草地過去。我很想多喫一點，因爲這是我在家裏最後一次的晚餐，但我終於比平常少喫了一碗。</p>

<h3 id="c253">蘇聯勞働婦女的現狀 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 講員繁新</p>
<p>店員，學徒，工友，和其他一切本刋的讀者！今天鄙人得有機會和諸君談談蘇聯勞働婦女一般的生活狀况，眞是不勝榮幸之至！</p>
<p>蘇聯的勞働婦女，不論在那方面，都完全與男子平等的。</p>
<p>十月革命，把蘇聯的婦女，從管理家務，看護小孩等的桎梏中解放出來，而都到工廠中，或農村中去，和男子一樣的工作着。</p>
<p>在工廠中，勞働婦女的工作成績，常常是超過男子的。她們採用了社會主義競賽和突擊隊的方式，來增加生産的速率，和改良勞働方法。她們常常提出各種實際的具體的意見貢獻給工廠委員會。</p>
<p>解放了的勞働婦女，在開始的時候，僅僅希望克服文盲，然而到了能讀能寫之後，她們又有更進一步的慾望，她們需要獲得政治智識，技術智識，文化智識等；因爲她們知道自己是新生活新世界的建設者丨社會主義社會的建設者。在放工後，她們多半是上俱樂部去娛樂去運動，或是上圖書館或學校去念書</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>。她們不願意有一分鐘的法費。自然她們也得　戀愛。可是她們對於戀愛，有原則上的規定，就是以不妨礙工作或求學爲主。如果誰在戀愛方面多化了些工夫，那就會被大衆批評的，</p>
<p>世界上没有一個國家的法律，能像蘇聯那樣的保障勞働婦女丨丨尤其是對於母性的保護。勞働婦女在生産前後，共有四個月的休養，在這時期内，工資還是照領的。過了這時期面重新入廠工作時，夜工，過度的工作或比較繁重的工作，對於她都是禁止的，直到過了相當的時期。嬰兒的必需品，在生下的九個月内，是由國家供給的。有小孩子的勞働婦女，到工廠去作工的時候，可以把她的小孩子放在托兒所裏丨丨那是由國家或她所做工的工廠設立的丨丨在那裏，有有學識的敎師和有經騐的保姆會照顧孩子，使母親可安心工作。</p>
<p>總之，蘇聯政府已經用了托兒所，幼稚園，兒童之家，公共食堂，公共洗衣所和各種合作社，把她們從「賢母良妻」的日常生活的覊絆中解放出來了。</p>
<p>蘇聯勞働婦女的工資，是根據她們對於技術的程度而定的。蘇聯對於勞働者，是與以各方面的便利，譬如房租，食品以及其他必需品，勞働者可以拿比非勞働者低廉的價値去獲得：而且每個勞働婦女，每年至少有兩個星期的休息，工資仍舊照給。所以，即使蘇聯勞働婦女的工資或許還及不上黄金美國的勞働婦女：但在實質上，因了上述的原因，是超過各資本主義國家中被壓迫被剥削的勞働婦女所得者。而且在第二次五年計劃的末了，還要把生活水準提高到兩倍或三倍呢。</p>

<p>— 沈藹容女士</p>
<p>我是個初中畢業生，在民國二十年秋考入了曁南大學附設的幼稚師範，但是不幸滬戰爆發，眞茹變爲戰區，誕生才數月的幼師科就此夭折，而我也隨之失學，至今已一載有半。</p>
<p>前幾天從友人處得到一個很好的消息，說是以前幼師科的學生可以揷入高中師範，不過，需依照普通科繳費。這是多麽可喜的消息！可是，無産階級的我，那裏來的這筆鉅欵呢（以前幼師科宿費學費都免的，只有膳費不免）？雖則爲數只有六七十元，在千金買笑的大腹賈，　腰纒十萬的達官富商，是算不了什麽一回事，可是在我們窮人眼中却是個很大的數目了。問朋友借吧？平生没問人家借過半文錢，實在羞於開口，况且信不信你，也還是一個問題；而親戚方面又都說：這樣大的女孩子讀什麽書，在家裏學習點女紅家事，早些出嫁是正經。不讀吧？這樣好的機會，錯過了又眞是太可惜，因爲曁大是國立的，而且成績在七十五分以上的，可以完全免費，這在窮小子的我，的確是個好消息，况且資格困人的苦，我已受夠了，没有高中文憑的人，便要到處撞釘子。在過去一年中，我爲了職業問題，也不知受了多少的閒氣，不，這是窮小子的自作孽，誰呌你有求於人的？没有什麽大舅子，小叔叔，老伯伯等在機關裏服務，花瓶，這貴族化的位置就没有你的份兒。當小學敎師吧？但没有登記過的，任你學識怎樣的豐富，總吃不着這碗清高的殘羹冷飯。當職員吧？我不得其門而入。當律師吧？我没有一些法學家的氣息。當女工吧？又於家庭的顔面有關。當舞女吧？那根本不是正當的女子職業。至於報上的招聘廣告我也去應徴過，但去函如黄鶴之不返，回音如大海之消沉，無非替郵局推銷二分郵票而已。這都是吃虧在没有資格，所以我無論如何要到高中畢業之後才求自立。可是我偏偏又是窮小子，力不從心，於是由焦急而苦悶，而失望了。現在離開學期尙有三月，我想在這三個月内謀一不論大小高低的職業；若能由此積得三五十元之數，似於下半年的學費不無小補。回音請由本刋轉。</p>

<h3 id="c255">紗廠减工工友生活應如何維持案 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 討論者議員亦萍</p>
<p>中國幼稚得可憐的民族工業，老是處在慘敗的地位。近因外貨傾銷，生産過剩，已深深的感到山窮水盡，無法維持牠的營業，不得已乃實行每星期減工兩天，以謀自救。同時，國内日商，亦因我國和印度抵制日貨的結果，生産過剩，開始實行減工。這些消息傳出後，喚起了社會上不少人士的注意。可見這個問題的嚴重，並不在於其他一切問題之下。</p>
<p>減工的結果，對於工人方面，無疑的會發生莫大的影響。事實上雖「每星期減少三班，每一工人實際只减少一班，一月亦祗四五班，每班工資六角計，亦只値二元餘之數」，但在世界上工資最低的我國，生活程度恰恰相反的一天高似一天，工人每月出賣血汗的結果，對於最低劣的生活，一般的常常瀕於飢餓線下，這二元餘的數目，無異將工人每月所得工資的二分之一乃至全部份的被剥奪了去，以彌補資本家所損失的。况且，中國人的生活，大部分是建立在大家庭的基礎之上，每個工人的背後，還有大家庭的負荷，一個工人的失業，立刻會影響到全家庭的生計的。如果大部分的工人因此而失業，社會上該會發生怎樣的一種現象？那眞是令人不堪設想的。</p>
<p>近來因農村的破壞，人民購買力的減退，以及東北處女地的被刦持，國貨原來的市塲，勢必縮小，所以也有所謂的生産過剩的現象發生。但是按其實際，恰恰是相反的。據去年的調查，全國紡錠總數，不過四百五十一萬六千八百九十八枚，而華商僅有二，五八九，零四零枚，約佔總數百分之五七，三一。以如此很少的數目，供給全國廣大的需求，不足是很顯然的事實，何有過剩的現象發生？縱令人民購買力減至一般的水準以下，也不會發生因生産的過剩而減工的現象。可知紗廠的這次減工，與其說是生産的過剩，毋寗說是由於外貨的傾銷，還來得把握住問題一些。所以，現在的問題，是如何抵制外貨，以提倡國貨，而不是什麽生産過剩，實行減工的問題了。</p>
<p>際此國難日深，人心惶惶的時候，資方對於勞方理應同舟共濟，以度此難關，絕不容有因减工的關係，形成成千累萬的産業預備軍，使社會上發生飢餓的恐慌。在工人方面，亦應聯合起來，用合法的手叚，據理力爭，非達目的不止。而同時，廠方更當本其犧牲的精神，不特不應減工，反而要給工人更多的工作機會，務使整個民族的生産，有長足的進步。就使有任何的苦衷，也不妨用公開的態度，站在相維相系的立塲上，共同請求政府，以國家的力量實施保護政策。並急激的喚起社會上各方面的注意，用整個民族的力量，抵制外貨的傾銷，使本國貨暢行於國土之上。那時候，工商業異常的發達，國民經濟亦甚活躍，工人的生活自然更會提高起來，停工和減工的失業現象也必然的會消聲　　，不　再見了。</p>

<p>— 曹文鍾</p>
<p>丨事業不能阻止愛情丨</p>
<p>據一般人眼光看來·夫婦兩人同在電影界服務對於家庭幸福怕發生危險，但是亞爾喬生並不反對他的夫人露佩凱萊投身影界，她本來是齊格飛舞團的台柱，自從在一九二八年九月二十一日和喬生結婚之後，她就脫離了舞台生涯。</p>
<p>她已和華納影片公司簽訂了一張長期合同。那張合同的性質近乎是一種生日的禮物。在八月二十五日那一天華納公司製片主任達利石納克爲了凱萊女士的拍影戲與喬生商量，徴求他的同意。喬生告訴他說：「今晚上，倘若你預備好一張合同，那末明天我們交給她看一定能夠使她驚喜得萬分的，因爲明天是她的生日，她很願意簽字的」。</p>
<p>凱萊簽了合同，在拍演第一張片子的時候，規定了二千美金的週薪，以後續期加俸。喬生是他的夫人的代理人兼經理人，他對於他的新任務十分欣悅，並且引起他的興趣。</p>
<p>他坦白地說：「當然，我很歡喜露佩有機會顯身於銀幕上面，藉此發展她的天才。她在這裏很寂寞，常常想到她在紐約時的舞台生涯。她的唯一的理由就是在好萊塢一些不忙。假使她能拍戲，可以使她提起興趣，可以使她愉快；倘若她不歡喜拍戲的話，她可以脫離的」</p>
<p>「一莊事情是實在的丨她無論如何不使事業妨礙我們的愛情和我們的生活。因爲她願意和我同居，所以她在舞臺上演戲的時候，故意的從樓梯上跌下來。她是一個非常的女子，她認識事情的是非，所以在我們的家庭裏能再造就一個電影明星，我是一些不疑懼的一。</p>
<p>露佩凱萊對於工作並非當作一件終身的事業，她可以加入或者即刻退出。喬生的進欵是很豐富的。他是一個寛大爲懷的丈夫，當作一件新鮮的玩意講，亞爾喬生是十分贊成他的妻子在電影界服務的。</p>

<h3 id="c257">「覺悟」觀後感 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 史澤永</p>
<p>友聯影片公司，自去冬解散後，素以武俠著名的范雪朋女士，即集資開辦强華影片公司，自任經理，從事製片工作，現在其第一部出品「覺悟」，已於前日（十九日）起公映於北京大戲院了。</p>
<p>本片的劇旨，把純潔的愛情，和虛僞的愛情，分析得清清楚楚，可爲現代的青年男女，作一個强有力的當頭棒喝，啓迪青年男女認識戀愛的眞諦。因現代的一般青年男女，日趨於墮落的道上，那萬惡的社會，也脫不了一部份罪惡的責任。如本片中：玉麟受了都市的誘惑，另有新愛，把一個可憐的梅姑，棄置不顧，其用情之不專，簡直把女子當作玩物。及後玉麟的財産，又被芸仙捲去，身邊一無所有，只得行乞到上海，這時候，那個「福無雙至，禍不單行」的梅姑，已淪爲舞女，並且還受了寃枉，判了十五年的監禁，期滿出獄，玉麟早已覺悟了，便把她携了回來。</p>
<p>一般沉涸在愛河裏的青年們，瞧了這部片子，倘若還不快快「覺悟，」眞是有負這片的苦旨了！</p>
<p>這部片子，它能夠警惕現代的青年，是値得我們感動和欽佩的。演員的表演，當以飾梅姑的范雪朋爲最好，還有一個從未和我們見過面的余光，也還可取，攝影方面，有幾幕，太複雜，而太糢糊了。佈景方面，其他倒還好，只有跳舞塲一幕，似乎太欠考究了些，這或許是爲資本所牽制吧？</p>
<p>總之，這部片子，比其他小公司的出品成功得多多了。</p>

<p>公共租界工部局絃樂隊，定今（星期日）晚九時一刻，在大光明影戲院舉行中西合璧的音樂會，由梅百器博士指導樂隊，並請梅蘭芳博士豋台介紹，茲探得其節目於下：（一）中國古樂選（大同音樂會），（二）琵琶獨奏「淮陰平楚」（衛仲樂先生），（三）詩歌的唱奏「晴雯絕命辭」（朱曼莘先生作，劉經方夫人唱，梅百器博士指導），（四）音的素描「北平胡同印象記」（交響詩），（五）中國啞劇「琴心波光」，此劇由俄國作曲家阿父夏洛穆夫作曲兼導演，梅蘭芳博士贊助。演員爲天一影片公司明星袁美雲等，乃根據中國民間故事，用五音旋律編成，共分五塲。結搆緊凑，情節離奇，且劇中動作，悉倣中國舞台戲程式云。</p>
<h3 id="c259">談「脂粉甫場」 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 聲安</p>
<p>明星影片公司近來很有顯著的進步，過去的「狂流」，現在的「脂粉市塲」，都是緊跟着時代的貢獻。</p>
<p>在意識方面，「脂粉市場」暴露出現代資本家怎樣利用「花瓶」來號召男顧客：又怎樣顯示出女性要自己創造自己的前程，這些都是有「時代化」的題材，但可惜片末的龔稼農緊跟胡蝶，未免「畫蛇添足」</p>
<p>導演張石川，比較「失戀」有進步，不過有許多很可描摹的地方，却輕輕放過，未免可惜。分幕以及鏡頭角度的靈活，顯出國産片是正在進步着。</p>
<p>講得表演，胡蝶演來很有魄力，細膩熨貼，絲絲入扣。龔稼農也很成功，不過没有「狂流」那樣有力。王獻齋也使人滿意。其餘配角，演來平平。</p>
<p>收音很清晰，對白也很婉妙，但有幾幕却嫌冗長沉悶，能夠短些更好。背景其藝術化，富麗堂皇，使人生美感。</p>
<p>總之，這一部「脂粉市場」是明星影片公司的上乘片子。</p>
<h3 id="c260">觀「除夕」後的所見 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>最近聯華的新片「除夕，」又在北京公映了，星期六的下午，校中照例是没有課的，因此我就趕去觀看，</p>
<p>但是，這張片子，却給我大大的失望了，劇本方面，完全不能和現在的實際情形相吻合；牠先前雖也曾替勞苦羣衆呐過喊丨可是到後來竟然然來一個資産階級人物救窮人的故事，劇本中所演的老學究仗義疎財，錢莊主樂善好施，這都是在替封建思想做宣傳文章，爲資産階級做壓迫羣衆的圈套，不客氣地說：牠簡直是在麻醉我們觀衆，這種惡劣的意識的影片，實在爲我們所不取的，</p>
<p>現在我們劈開意識，來談牠演出的技巧，那末這張片子，可以說尙値一觀，導演姜起鳳先生的手法很靈活，每一個鏡頭，都配置得很適宜，畫面是十分的美麗，其中有一幕舞塲主和錢莊收賬員在雪地上互相搏擊的一塲，攝得最好，但全片的劇情，似還不夠緊張，本來「除夕」是一個大悲劇，很有使人流淚的可能，但是終於没有熱淚從我的眼眶中流出來，這亦足見這張片子感動人的力量，還嫌不夠，</p>
<h3 id="c261">關於「除夕」的話 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 尼秋</p>
<p>「除夕」這名字巳經題得很藝術，觀丁後，覺得導演在這片裏是最成功的一個。因爲整部影片的故事，是極平凡的。若照牠本身說本祗是一部「巧」的影片，但經導演的努力，加入了幾個强有力的鏡頭後，就變成一部「力」的影片。</p>
<p>幾個鏡頭，像：老翁得皮夾後的驚喜態，理智衝突的表演都很好，這要歸功於劉繼羣的。此外如老翁借不到錢，回到家裏看見三百塊錢的那種表情，都是很難能的。餘幾個大寫也使人看了還不覺得重複。</p>
<p>黄紹芬在這片裏的攝影也較以前好强華影片公司新片「我們的生路」中之一幕由范雪朋余光合演多了，光線很柔和，佈景也很現實化，只有雪景太大意了點，很大的一片片落到了衣帽上，顯明了這是紙片，希望以後能夠改良。</p>
<p>演員大致還好，尤其是蔣君超，雖有許多地方過火了些，（像投江時的表演），但像收賬回莊時和陳燕燕見面時等，演來都很自然。</p>
<p>「除夕」的情節脫離事實的地方雖然很多，但都被導演的技巧輕輕地遮了過去。</p>
<p>綜說起來，「除夕」是一部短篇創作化的電影，描寫着平凡的人生過程，若能將劇本再加以精細的修改與補充，說不定會跟「大飯店」一樣的成爲傑作。所以我除了覺得「除夕」的意識方面，不很健全外，大致可以當得一句：「好影片」。</p>

<p>「再會，渥郎杜，」她重新說。「我永遠不會忘記你呀！」</p>
<p>「靠得住你不會忘記的！」他喊着。「等一等丨」他從經過的賣花女郎買一束鮮花揷進安琪拉詫異的臂挽。</p>
<p>「渥郎杜，你發狂了！」她嚴厲的說。但是她的眼睛却像有一層迷露似的朦朧着。</p>
<p>「自然我發狂了，」他很樂意的贊同着說。「他也一樣麽？」</p>
<p>「請去罷，」她懇求着，她的聲音有點戰慄。</p>
<p>「我不許進去麽？」他也懇促着。於是，他搖搖頭，他挑逗着問：「呀！這是遊園罷！你什麽時候准許遊客進去？明天？那末，星期五？」</p>
<p>「你不能呀丨你一定不可以！」她說。但是他的眼睛却表示着又一個意思，傳出一種　媚的情調。</p>
<p>他並攏靴根，舉手行一個軍禮，轉身就走。</p>
<p>「居望尼！」她柔媚地，顚狂地呌喊。</p>
<p>「是？」他急切地轉回身來。她伸出手。他又握着她的手。</p>
<p>「再會，」她十分柔媚地說。</p>
<p>他仍舊握着她的手。在這一刹那時間停着不動。他們倆默默無言地相視着。然後，慢慢地，勉强地，他們平分了開來。安琪拉一轉身溜進大鐵門，急促地跑上階沿閃入屋子裏去了。她經過聖女瓷像就停了步，把居望尼贈送的鮮花放在聖像足下，快樂地私語着：</p>
<p>「一個少年人買給我的。他的名字是居望尼。他說他很愛我。」她的眼睛仲起望着聖像，射出奇樣，神秘的光輝。然後，突然地，一個懷疑的影子掠過她的面龐。「那是錯了嗎，是是是？」她發出怨言。「他是這樣的一位美少年呀……假使那是錯的丨」她在胸上劃着十字，慢慢地跑下去了。她的嘴唇動着祈躊。（未完）</p>

<p>They Rushed to Xiguangkai at 2 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>They Were Defeated Immediately After Attacking Our Security Team Headquarters</p>
<p>Fifty to Sixty Plainclothes Troops Were Arrested</p>
<p>Three Japanese Planes Arrived in Tianjin for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The commander-in-chief of the plainclothes troops is Hao Peng, with a rumored strength of several thousand men. However, many deserted before the battle. On the 19th night, only two to three hundred people launched the attack. The Chinese territory within fifty meters of the Japanese concession and twenty police districts and posts were all evacuated to avoid direct conflict with Japanese soldiers. Merchants and civilians in areas without posts had already fled. At 8 PM, the entire city was placed under martial law. Those going from the Japanese concession to the French concession were subjected to strict inspection. It is rumored that a large-scale riot was scheduled for 10 PM on the 20th or 3-4 AM on the 21st.

<p>(Tianjin) The leaders of the plainclothes troops, Shi Yousan and Shi Fengming, launched the attack at 12 AM on the 19th. They first attacked from Haiguang Temple to Wandezhuang, occupying our Second District, Sixth Precinct. Our security team was ordered not to retaliate.

<p>No Bombs Dropped, Citizens Remain Calm</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 9:15 AM this morning, eleven Japanese planes flew in formation over Beiping for reconnaissance and demonstration. They came from the northeast, flying back and forth in the sky for about half an hour. When they first arrived, they flew very low, and the red markings on the planes were very clear. After circling once, they gradually rose to an altitude of approximately two thousand meters. Our anti-aircraft guns did not fire. Because the Japanese planes had been conducting reconnaissance for days without dropping bombs, the citizens remained very calm. All primary and secondary schools in Beiping City temporarily announced the suspension of classes, and students returned home. Most universities continued to hold classes as usual.

After reconnaissance, it was determined that the planes were not carrying bombs.

<p>(Beiping) At 9:15 AM this morning, a squadron of Japanese planes appeared from the northeast, divided into three groups: one group of five planes, and the other two groups of three planes each. They flew quite low, about three thousand feet above the ground. All were bombers. Residents, knowing that they must have come for a reason, mostly sought shelter. The planes flew back and forth in the sky like shuttles for half an hour before flying back the way they came. Their base is clearly outside Gubeikou. There were strong winds here this morning, so it was impossible to hear whether the anti-aircraft guns fired. However, judging from the fact that the planes initially flew as low as three thousand feet, and then the entire squadron rose to about five to six thousand feet above the ground, it was probably because the anti-aircraft guns had fired at them. The planes did not drop a single bomb, nor did they distribute leaflets. Their purpose seemed only to intimidate the residents. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Political Instability Makes Economic Stability Difficult</p>
<p>Hoping to Quickly Restore Peace in the Far East</p>
<p>Agree to Raise Silver Prices and Remove Trade Barriers</p>
<p>US Senator Pittman Announces Six-Point Program</p>
<p>(Minister Song Arrives in New York and is Welcomed)</p>
<p>(Washington) This afternoon, Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, went to the White House to have a final conversation with US President Roosevelt. Subsequently, the US President, together with Vice President Song, issued a joint communiqué as follows:</p>
<p>After completing our discussions, we are pleased to find that we are in agreement on the practical and feasible solutions that must be adopted to resolve the current major problems facing the world. We both believe that economic stability cannot be achieved without political stability, and only in a world where military armaments can be reduced can economic weapons of war be reduced. We sincerely hope that peace can be guaranteed and therefore urgently desire the immediate adoption of a practical disarmament plan. In this regard, we naturally think of the serious developments in the Far East, which have disturbed the peace of the world over the past two years and have led the armies of two great nations to engage in destructive hostilities. We firmly believe that these hostilities can be stopped immediately so that the current efforts of all countries in the world to rebuild political and economic peace can be successful. We fully agree that the unreasonable barriers to international trade must be removed, the chaos of finance and money must be rectified and restored to order. In this regard, we believe that raising and stabilizing the price of silver, a major medium of exchange in the East, is a fundamental objective. As for the many other measures that must be adopted to revive China's and the world's economic life, we all agree in the most harmonious way and are determined to approach the various issues of the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference with the determination necessary to achieve success.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Song issued a separate statement to the press, the content of which was largely the same as that contained in the communiqué. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen and his entourage arrived here today and received a warm welcome from important overseas Chinese figures in this area. Officials also sent people to greet them. After Song got off the train, he was protected by the police along the way from the station to the hotel. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen went to the White House this afternoon to bid farewell. Song will leave for New York this afternoon and is scheduled to sail to England on the 27th. Before Song leaves New York, he will have contact with bankers and experts on Wall Street. Song's entourage expressed satisfaction with the treatment they received in Washington and the results of discussions on Sino-US issues. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to US Senator Pittman, the silver plan to be proposed at the World Economic Conference by leading world financial countries only advocates the widespread use of silver as a currency base, and does not recommend a bimetallic system. Pittman announced today six measures agreed upon by the countries participating in the Washington talks, and said that the purpose of this plan is to stabilize and increase the price of silver. However, judging from what is currently agreed, it is clear that the countries are willing to widely use silver as a circulating currency, and there is no insistence on greatly promoting its use in currency reserves. The six measures are as follows: (1) To seek the stability and restoration of silver, but when an agreement determines a price, this matter is left to the London Conference for discussion. (2) Stabilizing the price of silver must be integrated with the overall adjustment of stabilizing international exchange rates so that silver can be given a definite position. (3) Abandoning the practice of reducing the silver content of currency and melting silver coins. (4) As soon as it can be implemented, immediately restore the original silver content in the currency. (5) Widespread use of silver as a currency base. (6) Remove silver tariffs and other obstacles that impede the free flow of silver internationally. It is said that the above six items will be greatly debated at the Economic Conference, but are only provided for discussion and may be rejected in the future. For example, the last item is included for discussion in order to satisfy silver producers. It is predicted that European countries may not agree, because some countries believe that free circulation will inevitably lead to dumping, and even the United States, Britain, and France will not support this. Therefore, the hope that congressional leaders had for concluding an international agreement to revitalize the silver industry and greatly increase the price of silver has gradually declined. Currently, the silver movement can only prevent it from falling further, but if production is reduced and widespread use as subsidiary currency is promoted, there will be hope for price increases in the future. It is expected that there will be very divergent opinions at the upcoming London Conference, but it is believed that the price of silver will be slightly higher than today.

<h3 id="e27">Disturbance in Tianjin <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Tianjin and Beijing has become tense due to the continuous advances of the Japanese army. It is said that the enemy has crossed the west bank of the Luan River, directly threatening Fengrun and Yutian. To the south, they have crossed the Great Wall and attacked Miyun, which is only a little over a hundred miles from the old capital. However, since Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Council, went north, the people of Tianjin and Beijing have calmed down, believing that even if permanent peace is not guaranteed, understanding in the midst of disputes is hoped for. Unexpectedly, the incident occurred beyond everyone's expectations. The disturbance in Tianjin suddenly erupted the night before. Three thousand plainclothes thugs emerged everywhere to harass the Chinese area, seize police firearms, and throw bombs indiscriminately. Even though the authorities responded with the utmost composure, the general public was already terrified. At the same time, eleven Japanese aircraft flew to spy over Beiping's airspace, circling for half an hour before leaving. The intent behind this is likely more than just a show of force.</p>
<p>According to general speculation, the chaos in Tianjin may not end here. On the surface, it appears to be traitors selling out national interests, coveting temporary gains and willingly acting as accomplices of the tiger, taking advantage of the chaos to plunder. Their behavior is despicable, and their intentions are ugly, truly like dogs and pigs. However, in reality, what exactly do these people gain? Looking at the current state of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the tyranny of the Japanese is already clear. The enemy's conspiracy to disturb North China has been brewing for more than just a day. Initially, they only wanted to use this to confuse international public opinion, disrupt the internal order of our country, and stabilize their invasion of the three northeastern provinces. Now that Rehe has been seized and Inner Mongolia is on the verge of being taken over, they still fear that we will rise up in time and make a final stand. Therefore, they scheme day and night, pressing with heavy troops on one hand, and on the other hand, they are doing everything possible to instigate their tools to realize the organization of a second puppet state, turning North China into the former "Manchukuo," and turning today's Manchukuo into the former Korea. In this way, the so-called "continental policy" can be realized, and the ability to deal with the United States, which is far across the Pacific Ocean, and the Soviet Union, which is next to "Manchukuo," can be sustained. This is why they are pressing forward step by step and acting recklessly.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese side, they repeatedly mention our country's resistance to Japan and blame us for lacking sincerity. In fact, since the September 18th Incident occurred the year before last, our country has always made concessions and has never actively resisted. The people's cries of discontent and the boycott of Japanese goods are merely a minimal and peaceful expression. Even our government's diplomatic efforts with Japan have been extremely peaceful. Who can say that we lack sincerity? Yet the Japanese army continues to attack. Therefore, the so-called existence or absence of sincerity is just a pretext for invasion.</p>
<p>Let us further discuss the sincerity of the Japanese side. At the beginning of the disaster in the Northeast, they declared that they would not invade our country's territory. What about now? They have expanded from the three northeastern provinces to Rehe. Before Rehe fell, the Japanese created the claim of not crossing the Great Wall. Now they have attacked Duolun, raided Miyun, and seized Luanzhou, in addition to disturbing Tianjin and threatening the old capital with aircraft. Where is their sincerity? Furthermore, while the Japanese side is proclaiming the way to mutual peace under understanding, at the same time, the Fourth and Sixteenth Infantry Brigades and the Third Cavalry Brigade under the command of Xiyiichi's Eighth Division, along with a field heavy artillery unit, are attacking Shunyi from the south of Miyun and invading Huairou from the west. Their intention to cut off the PingSui Railway and approach Tianjin and Beiping has not diminished in the slightest. Where is there any indication of a sincere desire for a truce?</p>
<p>Given the current perilous situation, shocked by the disaster in Tianjin, and angered by the continuous attacks of the Japanese army, we must strive to strengthen ourselves and thoroughly recognize the Japanese conspiracy. Even if we can obtain a temporary understanding now, it will not last long. We must endure hardship and pain, and thoroughly eliminate the past habit of complacency, starting from today.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Famous Soviet Journalist Discusses the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Famous Soviet journalist Radek today published an article in "Izvestia" discussing the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway and responding to the criticisms of foreign newspapers in China regarding this matter. Radek stated that China has repeatedly lost territory, yet it expects the Soviet Union to maintain the Chinese Eastern Railway, causing the Soviet Union to endure material losses, endangering the lives of its employees, and risking international conflict. Therefore, the protests in the newspapers lack sincerity, and the legal arguments are insufficient. It seems that those who are launching this anti-Soviet voice want to give the Chinese people the impression that the Soviet Union is deceiving them. Radek continued, believing that this movement opposing the sale of the railway does not necessarily represent the opinions of the truly patriotic Chinese with sound minds. He also stated that all those who value China's future must know that the Soviet Union will not sacrifice the interests of other people in order to compromise, but rather to foster strength that is detrimental to China. Radek concluded by saying that enlightened Chinese people and patriotic elements with foresight will surely recognize that imperialists are trying to avoid war among themselves and are using the railway issue as a linchpin to shift their war to the Soviet Union in order to weaken it, thereby making it easier to obstruct the national movements of colonial and semi-colonial countries.

<p>Expresses strong support for the President's suggestion</p>
<p>Hopes for the early realization of a non-aggression pact</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin's reply to the U.S. President's telegram was sent directly to the White House at 10:00 PM on the 19th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To His Excellency President Roosevelt of the United States of America in Washington, I have received Your Excellency's important message addressed to me and, through me, to the people of the entire nation of China. I have read it with deep pleasure and anticipation. The government and people of China, like your government and people, firmly believe that to ensure world peace, it is necessary for all countries to work together to eliminate any possibility of aggression. The method is not only to reduce armaments, but also to jointly guarantee that each other's territories will not be mutually invaded. The government and people of China also firmly believe that the revival of global prosperity can only be achieved by building an economic structure outside the current chaotic situation, so as to seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The Chinese government sincerely seeks lasting peace for any part of the world. In the past, it has cooperated with other countries in the discussions of the disarmament conference, and it will continue to work with them in the future. At the upcoming London Economic Conference, China will still participate in its work with the same sincerity as above. China is now a victim of aggression, and it is a victim of excessive armaments and new offensive weapons. A large number of armed forces have no right to cross China's borders and remain within its territory. Countless cities have been destroyed, and countless men, women, and children have lost their lives. This foreign aggression has shaken China's national politics and economic organization. Therefore, what is only a fear of aggression in other countries has become a reality in China. Therefore, the Chinese government more than any other government eagerly hopes that all countries in the world will participate in a solemn and definite non-aggression pact, reduce armaments to a strict level of self-defense, and conclude and implement an agreement not to dispatch armed forces of any kind across borders. The Chinese government is prepared to join other governments in implementing the various steps indicated in Your Excellency's message. These steps should be regarded as a complete plan to maintain the security of the countries of the world. The Chinese government also believes and hopes that the obligations indicated in Your Excellency's proposal, especially the obligations in the fourth step, should be realized as much as possible, so that world peace, which is related to politics and economics, can be achieved.

<p>The two countries have in fact established formal diplomatic relations</p>
<p>(Moscow) The reply from Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, to the U.S. President Roosevelt's disarmament application, was sent to Washington today. The text states: "I am confident that Your Excellency's application will be warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. The Soviet government, in the international conferences it has participated in for more than ten years, has represented the will of the Soviet people and repeatedly advocated universal disarmament as the basis for maintaining international peace. The Soviet government has proposed and supported universal disarmament in Geneva, as well as a plan to demand the maximum level of disarmament. At the same time, it has made every effort to refute those who use disarmament as a pretext to achieve their policy goals against other countries. The Soviet government has also proposed and supported certain measures to prevent aggression and expand its territory into other countries, and has signed non-aggression treaties with most countries with which it has formal relations. Therefore, it welcomes Your Excellency's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with all countries. The same is true for economic peace. The economic interdependence of countries around the world is generally known. The Soviet Union has also proposed in Geneva to conclude an economic non-aggression pact, because a country's aggression against another, whether military or economic, its impact is often not limited to the two countries involved, but can affect all countries, because it can increase existing economic disputes. The Soviet Union will continue to work in the spirit of this policy, and is willing to cooperate with other governments in the Disarmament Conference and the World Disarmament Conference to achieve its realization." (TASS dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Although the Soviet reply summarized the Soviet Union's previous proposals for universal disarmament and economic non-aggression, the wording was vague and limited to the suggestions made in the U.S. President's message, without addressing other issues. According to reports, this reply is the first official document directly delivered by Soviet Russia to the U.S. government. (National Telegram from the 19th)</p>

<p>Henderson Declaration: The key to war and peace depends on disarmament</p>
<p>Eden believes that the disarmament conference has reached the stage of resolution</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the Disarmament Conference developed a new atmosphere because Germany accepted the British disarmament plan, not only recognizing it as a basis for discussion, but also as the foundation for a future disarmament convention. After hearing that German representative Nadolny had arrived in Geneva from Berlin, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson convened a meeting of the General Committee. There were almost no empty seats in the audience. The atmosphere at the time was quite tense. Henderson issued sincere words, urging all countries to carry out disarmament work, saying that the issue of war and peace will now be decided by the Disarmament Conference, and that disarmament will be the first real victory in breaking away from the previous global economic turmoil, and that it is particularly important when the World Economic Conference is about to open.</p>
<p>German representative Nadolny accepted the British plan as the basis for a future convention, saying that any amendments Germany will propose will be consistent with this new attitude, to show Germany's moderate spirit and its willingness to work with other countries to achieve a disarmament convention. He hoped that other countries would also do their best to adapt their interests to the scope of the British plan.</p>
<p>British representative Eden welcomed Nadolny's remarks and said that his talks with Nadolny in the past week had not yielded glorious results, but he was prepared to continue the discussion in order to achieve better results. The current work is still daunting, but the Disarmament Conference has now reached a stage where it can be resolved. Today's meeting has greatly increased the chances of disarmament success. He welcomed U.S. President Roosevelt's declaration and his assistance to the British Prime Minister's plan on behalf of Britain. According to British Prime Minister MacDonald's plan, it is an effort to find a basis that the whole world can recognize. French representative Massigli then spoke, saying that the time for declarations has now passed, and the time for resolutions has now arrived. It is gratifying that France and the United States share the same aspirations. It is especially welcome that Nadolny can cooperate unconditionally in the Geneva cause due to Hitler's remarks. Finally, Swiss Foreign Minister Dr. Ruthstupel issued a brief speech, welcoming U.S. President's announcement to the world. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference's morning meeting did not discover any new facts. The representatives of various countries only expressed general views on the declarations of U.S. President Roosevelt, German Prime Minister Hitler, and Nadolny. Dutch representative Rutger read out the Dutch Queen's reply to President Roosevelt. Finnish representative Holst Ting then spoke, saying that the Disarmament Conference now has a new atmosphere, but demanded that greater freedom be given to small countries regarding naval disarmament. Swiss representative Muta and Norwegian representative Lange also mentioned Roosevelt's declaration, saying that the situation in Geneva has eased as a result. Then Danish representative Bojaiberg declared that President Roosevelt's proposal to respect the borders of all countries is most valuable. Finally, Belgian representative Pulgen declared that the British plan is the crystallization of all good will, and deeply congratulated Geneva on seeing the light again. According to indirect sources, the German representative intends to revise most of the amendments it proposed ten days ago, especially on the issue of military quotas. Germany will propose a five-year period to change its military system in accordance with the British plan. On the issue of armaments, Germany does not insist on obtaining items similar to existing offensive armaments, but demands that all offensive armaments be banned within five years. In addition, it also demands that equal rights be applied to Germany in terms of armaments and military quotas. Finally, Germany expressed its support for the armament inspection system, the wider the scope, the better. The General Committee has now adjourned until next Monday, when it will meet at the same time as the Administrative Council meeting. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Since German representative Nadolny announced that he accepted the British disarmament plan in principle, people's hearts were slightly comforted. However, all newspapers believe that the disarmament convention must include all countries to be truly effective. Some newspapers believe that the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense, and it has never been more difficult to seek global coordination than today. The Labor Party's organ newspaper, the Daily Citizen, said that it is too absurd to talk about disarmament and forget Japan, because Japan is currently expanding its armaments and is unwilling to reduce them or accept any restrictions. The newspaper also said that Japan clearly intends to establish a vassal state in North China similar to "Manchukuo," and is instigating assassinations and acts of terror in Beijing and Tianjin to arouse panic, so as to use it as an excuse to interfere.

<p>Xiaolai, Chen Guofu and others attended, as well as dozens of guests including President Wang and Ju Zheng, Peng Xuepei, and Chen Qicai. The meeting was presided over by Zhu Peide, Standing Committee member of the Association. President Wang delivered an admonishment, stating that China's aviation industry is far behind other countries, which are all making progress in aviation. Even the countries that are invading us have thousands of aircraft. If we do not talk about aviation at this time, it can be said that we have no national defense at all. The failure of the war in North China and Shanghai is proof of this. We advocate resistance, but without aviation equipment, it is impossible. Now the enemy air force is only using bombing, and has not yet used fierce poison gas. If fierce poison gas is dropped, it can turn prosperous cities into deserts, and neither humans nor animals can survive. Now all countries, whether governments or people, believe that air defense is more important than water defense and land defense. For the sake of the survival of the country and the nation, we cannot but pay attention to aviation equipment and use all our strength to complete aviation construction. The government is now doing its best to do it, and hopes that all personnel will help. This is the reason for the establishment of the National Aviation Construction Association. Now we cannot just talk about ideals, but must concentrate various forces, such as talent training, aircraft manufacturing, and economic planning. Next, Secretary-General Ge Jingen reported on the preparations. Then Ju Zheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaolai gave speeches. Afterwards, photos were taken and the meeting was adjourned.

<p>(Nanjing) The Aviation Construction Association telegraphed on the 20th, saying (titles omitted): All are aware that the aviation industry is a key national defense plan. China's national situation is precarious, and transportation is blocked. Whether in peacetime or wartime, the need for aviation is particularly urgent. Now, in order to promote the aviation industry, the government has established the National Aviation Construction Association and hired Ziwen and others as members. They will respectfully assume office after the meeting on May 20. We believe that aviation construction is complex and difficult, and Ziwen and others are humbly entrusted with heavy responsibilities, and are deeply concerned about their own shortcomings. We hope that talented people in the country will express their opinions, and overseas compatriots will provide assistance. We will unite the government and the people as one, and concentrate intelligence and financial resources. The future of aviation depends on this. We hereby submit this report and respectfully request your review. Members of the National Aviation Construction Association: Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, Qian Xinzhi, Shi Liangcai, Ge Jingen, and all other members respectfully offer their greetings.

After accepting the case, the Supreme Court, after a lengthy period of research, believed that the cause of Liu's death, whether it was Tao killing him without resistance or being killed in a mutual fight, must be investigated more thoroughly in order to avoid injustice. It has already been ruled to be sent back to the Hangzhou Higher Court for retrial. (Special dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Young Man in Peiping Stabs Japanese Soldier <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) At 10 AM this morning, when Private First Class Aoyama was on duty as a sentry in front of the Japanese Garrison barracks in Jiaomin Lane, a burly Chinese man suddenly drove up in a car, pulled out a green dragon sword and slashed at Aoyama's head. He attempted to escape in the same car, but Aoyama, undaunted, cooperated with Superior Private Koshi of the Kempeitai, and they arrested the man in front of the Japanese Legation and sent him to the Kempeitai. Captain Kishimoto interrogated him and learned that his name was Zhao Fashi, from Hunan. He had a statement in his possession insulting the Japanese army. It was a planned attack on the Japanese army. After the incident, earth mounds were built in front of the barracks as a precaution. The commander of the garrison infantry, Lieutenant Colonel Awaihara, visited He Yingqin and lodged a serious protest and issued a serious warning, requesting that soldiers retreating from the Miyun and Huairou areas not be allowed to enter the city. Captain Kishimoto is still continuing the interrogation. Because the incident occurred in Jiaomin Lane, within the extraterritorial rights area, where the embassies, barracks, and banks of various countries are located, the entire garrison is on high alert. According to Deputy Commander Hama of the Beiping Garrison, the result of the interrogation of the criminal is that he was sent by Chiang Kai-shek. To stab an armed Japanese soldier with a knife is obviously an act of challenge. Therefore, Japan attaches great importance to this matter. (Electric communication from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, a Chinese youth drove to the entrance of the Japanese barracks, got out of the car, and stabbed the head of the guard in front of the barracks with a sharp blade. It is said that the injuries are quite serious and his life is in danger. After committing the crime, the youth wanted to escape by car, but before he could get in, the driver panicked and drove the car away first. Japanese soldiers chased him outside the camp and arrested the youth and brought him to the Japanese barracks. His fate is unknown at this time. A foreign reporter who took a photo was also arrested, but has now been released. It is said that the Japanese side is very angry and has placed sandbags in front of the barracks and added double guards wearing steel helmets. News from the Japanese side this afternoon is that the Japanese military authorities have sent a document to He Yingqin regarding the incident this morning. The content is unknown. It is believed that it will describe the incident from the Japanese point of view. According to a special dispatch from the Japanese side, this matter may cause a serious backlash and make it impossible for the local agreement rumored after Huang Fu's arrival in the north to be reached. The Japanese soldier who was stabbed is seriously injured, and the Chinese youth is still being detained in the Japanese barracks. (Reuters telegram from the 20th)</p>

<p>Monetary Issues May Be Considered First</p>
<p>Young Designated as US Chief Representative</p>
<p>▲National Telegraph, London, 19th: The order of discussion of the four major issues at the World Economic Conference has caused a headache for British and other national experts, because the situation has changed since the United States abandoned the gold standard. British experts initially believed that international trade restrictions should be discussed first, followed by stabilizing exchange rates, raising prices, and monetary and credit policies. The British feel that countries should not be asked to agree on monetary and credit policies until other issues are resolved. However, after meeting with US experts, the procedure was changed. Monetary issues will now be considered first. Although the actual discussions at the future meeting may not necessarily follow this procedure, some experts believe that the instability of the US dollar has seriously hindered Anglo-American trade, so monetary issues should be discussed first. Furthermore, major countries' efforts to stabilize exchange rates are expected to remove obstacles to tariff issues. As for prices, they have already risen. Looking at the current situation, the World Economic Conference may end earlier than expected. In short, currency and tariffs will be the two biggest issues at the conference. It has not yet been decided which should be discussed first.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 19th: Dr. Schacht, president of the Deutsche Bank, passed through here this afternoon on his way back from the United States and plans to stay briefly to meet with Norman, governor of the Bank of England. Norman greeted him at the station. Dr. Schacht did not want to make any statements about his talks with President Roosevelt in Washington, as he must first report to the government.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 20th: People here are very interested in and also uneasy about the meeting between the president of the German central bank, Schacht, and the governor of the Bank of England. This meeting continues the talks that Schacht had in France and the United States, and is based on German foreign debt. This meeting is very important because it takes place before the German creditors' meeting on May 29. The situation of Germany's delayed transfers has caused unease in London banking circles. London banking circles criticize the National Socialist government, saying that it has never improved German finances and believes that Germany should first ask for a sacrifice on long-term loans. If short-term debts are also to be deferred, British banks must use rediscounting methods to assist bondholders. Therefore, people generally intend to relend to the German central bank in order to avoid the suspension of due debts.</p>

<p>Reports on Internal and External Situation</p>
<p>Finance Minister Declares Intention to Remain in Office</p>
<p>▲United Press, Tokyo, 20th: Prime Minister Saito visited Saionji in Okitsu at 1 PM this afternoon and held talks for one hour. He left at 2:15 PM and took a car to Numazu to see the Empress Dowager. In the car, he told reporters that today's visit to Saionji was not to retain Finance Minister Takahashi. The decision of Finance Minister Takahashi to stay or leave is the responsibility of the cabinet and should not bother the elder statesman. He absolutely did not want such a method of shirking responsibility. However, the purpose of his visit to Saionji was to report on the truth of the May 15th Incident, Roosevelt's peace application, the progress of the Sino-Soviet Railway incident, countermeasures for the World Economic Conference, the current situation of the disarmament conference, the military situation in North China, and the internal situation of the domestic political situation. As for the issue of the finance minister's stay or departure, he will seek to meet with Takahashi for discussion in the near future after returning to Tokyo. The current situation requires him to stay in office, and he will certainly not disappoint the public's expectations. If Finance Minister Takahashi refuses to stay in office, whether he will step down to take responsibility cannot be predicted. He is not optimistic about the future, but he is not pessimistic either.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: Ogawa Heikichi and the three Iron Ministers successively visited Finance Minister Takahashi at 10 AM today. They exchanged opinions on the finance minister's retention and the actual situation of the political world. At noon, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters that he could only stay in office temporarily. There are rumors that there is a tacit understanding with Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, but he can swear to heaven and earth that his talks with Suzuki are blameless and not as the public says. He is very confused as to why the public wants to use him as a tool to topple the cabinet. Furthermore, the three Iron Ministers said after meeting with the Finance Minister that they only talked about the affairs of the Seiyukai with Takahashi and did not involve the issue of advancing or retreating. Although they had previously clearly stated their resignation, it now seems that they have changed their minds.</p>

<p>▲National Press, Maima, 19th: The dispute between Peru and Colombia over the jurisdiction of the port of Leticia has been resolved. The details will be announced soon. This time, Colombian leader Lopez was invited to the Peruvian capital to discuss a resolution with Peruvian President Benavides. Leticia is a small port on the Amazon River, formerly an important rubber market, with a population of just over 1,000. It was ceded by Peru to Colombia in 1922, but last year, Peruvian unofficial troops, driven by nationalism, seized the port, and the Peruvian government then sent troops to follow up and refused to return it. As a result, the two countries have been fighting undeclared wars for months. Since the assassination of former Peruvian President Sanchez and the succession of the new President Benavides, policies have changed slightly, and they have finally been persuaded by neutral countries and the League of Nations to begin negotiations.</p>

<p>▲National Press, Geneva, 19th: The committee studying various proposals for the reform of the League of Nations Administrative Council decided today to increase the number of non-permanent directors by one, that is, from nine seats to ten seats, for a total of fifteen seats including the permanent directors. This new approach will be piloted for three years to allow representatives of countries that do not belong to any geographical or political group to join the Administrative Council. The German representative argued that it should be reconsidered before the end of the three years in order to find a way to change the current factional system. At the beginning of the establishment of the Administrative Council, there were four permanent and four non-permanent directors. Later, the number of non-permanent directors was increased to six and then nine, and now it is ten.</p>

<p>▲Havas, Warsaw, 19th: The conflict between the National Socialist Party and the National People's Party in the Free City of Danzig has become more acute. The National People's Party has fiercely criticized the National Socialist Party for occupying the Social Democratic Union, and the leader of the National Socialist Party said, "Since the National People's Party seems to be uniting with the Social Democrats to deal with our party, we can no longer cooperate with it, and we should also use the same method of dealing with the Social Democrats to overwhelm that party."</p>
<h3 id="e70">Sound Measures Already in Place for Security in Peiping and Tianjin <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— It is Reached</p>
<p>Japanese Army Stops Advancing, Our Army Deploys New Defense Line</p>
<p>Huang Fu Says He Comes to Save the Nation With a Spirit of Sacrifice</p>
<p>(New Developments in the Northern Situation, People's Hearts Gradually Stabilizing)</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: The Japanese army's large-scale invasion of Shanhaiguan this time has several steps. The first step is to invade the major towns of eastern Luanhe, and the western parts of Shixia and Miyun, deploy troops in Shanhaiguan, and threaten Peiping and Tianjin. The second step is to buy off traitors to brew a puppet organization "North China State," while surrounding Peiping and Tianjin and stirring up the northern situation. However, their greatest purpose is not to directly occupy Peiping and Tianjin and make any displays of power. Their maneuvering and posturing are nothing more than to ensure their possession of the three northeastern provinces and Jehol and Chahar, and to complete their Manchurian-Mongolian policy. As for their main demands on us, the first is to sign an acknowledgment of the puppet "Manchukuo" and directly offer up tens of millions of square miles of land and people. The second is to delineate Peiping and Tianjin as political districts, with the Great Wall as the boundary, with mutual non-aggression. If one of the two is achieved, the goal has been reached. As for Shanhaiguan, there is no desire for the time being. They turn to capture Chahar and actively devote themselves to the development of the three northeastern provinces and Jehol and Chahar, realizing their Manchurian policy that they have never forgotten for decades. Now the first step of the plan has been completed, and the goal they hoped to achieve has also slightly deviated from their wishes. Therefore, since the previous day, the Japanese troops on all routes have stopped advancing and are waiting for the situation to unfold. Our country's policy towards Japan has always been one of resistance and negotiation due to the lack of national strength. Responding to the above, we have no choice but to change with the times and the location. Since the September 18th Incident, we have been making resistance in terms of strength, while seeking the support of international justice and fairness. The various countries are constrained by their own interests and the atmosphere of world unrest regarding the Sino-Japanese problem. They are reluctant to act for fear of the consequences, and the Japanese bullies have been rampant and lack of sanctions. Under this environment, our country can only strive for development with the sympathy of all countries in the world. Although the national strength is weak, it is absolutely difficult to accept the alliance under the city. It is extremely difficult to sign and acknowledge the "Manchukuo," even if only an inch of land and a single soldier are left. We can only maintain an attitude of non-compromise and non-peace, and seek a temporary peaceful solution under mutual understanding. Since the large-scale invasion of the Japanese army, the generals at the front have been able to work hard to fight against the powerful enemy. However, in this era of scientific warfare, flesh and blood are no match for the ruthless sharp weapon, resulting in the strong bandit penetrating deeply and Peiping and Tianjin feeling threatened. All parties feel that the security of Peiping and Tianjin is related to the safety of the entire country, and they must try their best to seek a policy of stability. A considerable method has now been agreed upon, and it may be nowhere for a while. Judging from today's situation, the northern situation seems to have a spring cloud spreading and gradually revealing a peaceful image, and the panicking hearts of the people are gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Huang Fu, the chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Reorganization Committee stationed in Peiping, has had close talks with all parties in Nanjing and Shanghai after being ordered. On the way north, he also exchanged views with Lu Han, Ji Yu. After arriving in Peiping yesterday afternoon, he went to Jurintang to visit He Yingqin and discussed secretly for several hours. At 9 PM that night, he gathered key figures from the military and political circles in Peiping in Yiniantang to discuss the northern situation until midnight before the meeting adjourned. He met with the press this morning at 10 AM and made the following important remarks:</p>
<p>"What I personally wanted to say on this trip north was all mentioned when I passed through Tianjin. I just arrived in Peiping yesterday and am not yet fully aware of the situation in all aspects. People in the south only know that the situation in the north is serious. Only after arriving in the north did I realize how serious it is. My task, as the name implies, is to be a political officer. Regarding diplomatic affairs, the central government has repeatedly stated, and Mr. Wang Jingwei has also made many statements. I am dispatched here to handle everything in accordance with the central government's intentions. After the 17th year of the Republic, I lived at home in Mogan Mountain and did not ask about politics for six years. Old friends in the government often took the national affairs into consideration, and I politely declined because I did not dare to take on any positions again. This time, in view of the country's such a crisis, and the north where I have lived for more than 20 years, which is no less than my second hometown, because of historical and emotional reasons, I think this appointment is absolutely different from the previous situation. I came here with a spirit of sacrifice to save the country from danger. You in the north only know the severity of the air here. I don't know the hidden worries of the south. I recently went to Nanchang, where I learned that the communist situation is not only difficult to suppress, but is also growing day by day. The enemy in the north is so serious, and the hidden dangers in the south are also at risk of exploding. If we wait for the country to collapse before we start to remedy it, it will be even more difficult, so we must wait for it to collapse and first start to remedy a part of it. Knowing that it is a fire pit, we should also jump in first. The current situation can be set as an analogy, such as in a house, a heater is needed in winter and a fan is needed in summer. It is summer, and a fan is needed. The heater cannot be completely abandoned, but if the furnace continues to burn, it will be too hot to survive. The Political Affairs Reorganization Committee can also be established within ten days. In such times, it is not necessary to organize, and things can be done the same way to avoid the spirit being used for internal trivial matters," and so on. The war at the front has stopped since the day before yesterday. Our troops have all reached the planned defense line. The Japanese army has also stopped advancing. Xu Tingyao's military headquarters has moved to Beiyuan on the outskirts of Peiping today. The military headquarters of He Wansong and other armies have also been relocated. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Returning from the Front Lines <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(1) Observations from Tianjin by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Tianjin: Our army at the Beining front began a westward retreat on the 13th at midnight. For several consecutive days, orders to garrison at a location were immediately followed by orders to retreat. Veterans of military life simply left their packed belongings at the station and did not venture elsewhere, constantly inquiring about train departure times to be ready to leave at any moment. As a result, the station was piled high with goods, often overcrowded. However, the troops retreating to Xugezhuang on the 14th had a rest for two days and nights. Although it was reported that Wang Yizhe's unit on the Pingyu Avenue, due to pressure from superior enemy forces (what the front-line troops called flanking maneuvers), had retreated from Fengrun (Xugezhuang belongs to this county) to the vicinity of Yutian, and the enemy continued to pursue, Wang's unit appeared to be continuing its retreat. Even on the mornings of the 15th and 16th, enemy planes had visited the skies above, circling and surveying. News of the enemy bombing Fengrun County also spread frequently. By the afternoon of the 16th, around 1 or 2 PM, refugees who had fled from the mining areas east of the village suddenly returned in disarray, their faces ashen with panic, saying that the situation in Tangshan was extremely chaotic. Around 9 or 10 PM the previous night, as our last retreating troops were leaving the station, countless traitors and rioters in yellow and gray, with mismatched clothing, emerged and caused disturbances everywhere. Those who resisted were harmed. We turned back and ran away, and so on. Once this news spread, the villagers were even more alarmed than before. People ran wildly, and many shops closed. As a result, rumors of continued retreat became even more rampant. It was said that the Wang and Weng-Zhang divisions, after bravely resisting the enemy and suffering heavy casualties, had no choice but to retreat. Villagers who carried wounded soldiers to this place witnessed the reality and were still willing to forgive them, praising them endlessly. The reporter, hearing of their noble deeds and admiring them, wished to detour to visit them, inquire in detail about the truth of the battle situation to share with readers, and fulfill the promise made earlier to meet the army commander and division commanders again on the front lines when they were encountered in Sanhe. Unfortunately, due to transportation issues, this was not possible. Furthermore, Staff Officer Yang of the 57th Army said that the war clouds were so thick that even Commander Wang might not know his location at any given moment. Thus, the reporter decided to join the refugees, who were as lost as stray dogs, crowding onto the night train back to Tianjin, which was packed beyond capacity. The journey was often delayed because military transport trains were stopped on various sidings to allow passage, causing delays that nearly doubled the usual train speed. The next morning (the 17th), at 9 AM, the reporter visited Chairman Yu of the Hebei Provincial Government, but because it was not visiting hours, the reporter exited and walked north along Jingyi Road. The roadside was full of pistol-carrying police officers, spaced about ten meters apart, and vigilance was especially high at intersections. Whenever a rickshaw moved slowly or pedestrians paused to watch, they were severely interfered with. Countless cars drove in a continuous stream, heading towards the new station. It was later learned that Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, would arrive in Tianjin this morning to go to Beiping. Subsequently, there was news of a bomb explosion. Although Mr. Huang was fortunately unharmed, the atmosphere in Tianjin, already tense as "the mountain rain is about to come, and the wind fills the building," was further shaken by this sudden noise. Fortunately, the military and police authorities, since the 15th (the night of widespread rumors of traitorous riots), had implemented strict precautions, and all district teams were notified to pay special attention. In the event of an incident, traffic on all four roads leading to the location of the incident should be cut off, and pedestrians and vehicles should not gather in large numbers in one place. Suspicious households and pedestrians should be inspected. 2. Ferry boats and cargo ships in the river should be prohibited from passing if necessary. 3. Extra protection should be given to telephone exchanges, power plants, and bridges. 4. Strict precautions should be taken against those who hide bombs. 5. Those who spread rumors to mislead the public and engage in reactionary speech should be strictly arrested to maintain public safety and stabilize people's hearts. Shops and markets were filled with Russian goods, and it was said that anti-Japanese goods had gradually disappeared. Customers were as lively as usual, but most were just wandering around, and few actually had money to buy goods. Money shops mostly kept copper coins, causing copper coins to soar in price. In the past two days, the exchange rate for foreign currency had dropped to more than forty copper coins per yuan. Since Japanese planes flew to Beiping for reconnaissance and news of the retreat of troops guarding western Luan County spread, many residents moved into the British and French concessions, followed by the Italian concession, while the Japanese concession had none and some were even moving out. Among those seen moving along the way, many were refugees from Beiping (since the discovery of Japanese planes in Beiping, daily sales of first and second-class train tickets from Beiping to Tianjin were three thousand yuan higher than usual) and from the front-line war zones seeking refuge in Tianjin.</p>

Meeting Mr. Zhang , it is said that Mr. Huang should urgently go to Beiping to stabilize the hearts of the people of Beiping and Tianjin and handle the serious situation as the most urgent matter. The crude establishment of the committee seems like it can be delayed. After the international judgment from the thirteen votes against one vote last year, to the forty-two votes against one vote in February this year, Japanese diplomacy has been isolated. However, in reality, our country has not received any real international assistance. In other words, it is difficult to hope that the League of Nations will impose economic sanctions on Japan. Both the United States and Russia, which the Japanese consider their hypothetical enemies, also seem reluctant to offend Japan quickly. These are the disappointments of our country towards the West, and also the successes of Japan. They greatly hope that our country will recognize that the West is unreliable and should still turn to them to jointly seek the so-called East Asia cooperation and Sino-Japanese friendship. However, unless Japan broadens its vision and changes its policy of aggression, it will be difficult for our country to compromise. The result will inevitably be that China has nowhere to go, Japan also has nowhere to go, and world peace will be greatly disrupted. As for the current safety of Tianjin, it is said that there are about two or three thousand traitors who originally thought that if the Japanese army approached, they would become restless. Otherwise, since they have already obtained ill-gotten gains, they will likely have to find opportunities to harass and create a chance to report their “losses”. However, our military and police have already taken strict precautions.</p>

<p>Military and Political Leaders of Beiping Welcome Him at the Station</p>
<p>He Yingqin Summons Generals to Report on Military Affairs</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: Huang Fu, the newly appointed Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, along with the director of the Secretariat, He Qi , Tao Lüqian, He Jiecai and others, a group of more than ten people, traveled north from Nanjing by train on the 15th night, passed Jinan on the 16th evening, and briefly delayed his trip to meet with Shandong Province Chairman, Han Fuqu. He then changed trains and continued north. On the morning of the 17th, at 9:40 AM, he arrived at the new Tianjin Station. At 1:30 PM, he departed from Tianjin and did not arrive in Beiping until 4:40 PM. A detailed account of Mr. Huang's journey north is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e73">A Shock in Tianjin <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Huang Fu arrived at the new Tianjin Railway Station at 9:40 AM on the 17th, where Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong and leaders of provincial committees and various agencies were present to welcome him. After disembarking, Yu and Huang rode in the same car, traveling along Dajing Road directly to the provincial government. Security was tight along the way, with security teams and military police holding pistols and broadswords, standing guard in the center of the road and on both sides. At 11 AM, Chairman Yu hosted a welcome banquet in the large reception hall of the provincial government to welcome Huang. At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, Huang and others took the original train to Beiping. As Huang's train arrived at the new station, a young man threw a bomb from the overpass at No. 21 Yangqi outside the station. The explosion was extremely loud, shocking the staff at the new station. Two soldiers guarding under the bridge were also stunned and fell. The bridge suffered minor damage. The young man who threw the bomb was captured by the patrol police and sent to the First Army Headquarters for interrogation at 10:30 AM. He identified himself as Liu Kuaisheng, sixteen years old, from Caozhou, Shandong, and worked as an assistant in a manure factory in Hedong. Although he firmly denied throwing the bomb, patrol police and military police witnessed it firsthand. Therefore, he was escorted near the new station at 12:30 PM and beheaded as a warning. Because he did not admit to throwing the bomb, no confession was made public. According to speculation, Huang Fu's trip north and the atmosphere of compromise with Japan in Beiping and Tianjin, may be the reason why the young man opposed compromise with Japan and threw a bomb as a warning. Some also said it was traitors taking the opportunity to create disturbances. There were various rumors. Also, next to Jiajia Bridge on Dajing Road in Hebei, there was a tea stall with a white cloth bag on the tea table and a villager sitting next to it. Just as Huang Fu was about to go from the provincial government to the station, military police were heavily deployed along the way, and security was tight. Initially, the villager was not noticed, but after martial law was announced and the villager still lingered, the military police went forward to check and found a bomb weighing forty pounds in the white cloth bag. The villager tried to escape but was subdued by the military police and sent to the First Army Corps Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Denies Compromise <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Because Huang Fu's trip north was related to the issue of easing the situation in North China, the reporter rushed to Tianjin on the morning of the 17th. After Huang arrived in Tianjin, he issued a statement to the press, saying, "I have lived in the South for a long time and do not wish to be involved in politics. Recalling the winter of the 13th year of the Republic, when Mr. Feng Yuxiang led his troops back to Beijing and overthrew Cao Kun, I was ashamed to serve in the Regency Cabinet. That lesson is still fresh in my mind. Now, revisiting the old capital, I cannot help but feel a sense of the present. The Political Affairs Reorganization Committee cannot decide on a date to meet because all the members have not yet arrived. However, the work of the committee can be carried out at any time in contact with all the members. There is no need to wait for the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee. I will follow the Central Government's consistent policy of negotiating while resisting to deal with the critical situation in North China. Only through the joint efforts of all parties can the national crisis be averted. Rumors that I will compromise with Japan after arriving in Beiping are absolutely untrue. I believe that at this time, no one in China dares to compromise with Japan. I have not been to Beiping and Tianjin for many years and do not know the current situation. I will first go north to observe the actual situation before determining the reorganization of political affairs in North China. Minister He (Yingqin) is responsible for military matters, and I can also participate with my opinions. Negotiations with Japan cannot be achieved in just a few words or half a day. Local issues in North China cannot be negotiated locally. Everything must still be presided over by the Central Government. As for stabilizing the hearts of the people in North China, I very much want to achieve this goal, but if there is no practical demonstration, it will not be beneficial. I am not confident about this, so I will not speak rashly. Rumors that military agencies in Beiping and Tianjin will be relocated to create a buffer zone between China and Japan are untrue. I think this is unfounded talk and is inaccurate."</p>

<p>The reporter left Tianjin with Mr. Huang at 1:30 PM and did not arrive at the East Railway Station in Beiping until 4:40 PM.

The Military Council had also dispatched a company of guards and a platoon of Central Military Police to guard inside and outside the station. From the East Railway Station to Zhongnanhai, the Public Security Bureau dispatched additional bicycle squads to guard the route. After Huang got off the train, he shook hands and thanked each of the welcomers, then left the station and drove directly to Jurentang in Zhongnanhai to visit He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Military Council. After talking for about an hour, he returned to Fengzeyuan to rest.</p>

<p>After resting briefly at Fengzeyuan, Huang went to Nanhai Jurentang to visit He Yingqin. They had a confidential discussion until about 6 PM before leaving. At 7 PM, He hosted a banquet at Jurentang to welcome Huang, inviting Jiang Bocheng, Wang Kemin, Zhang Qun, and others to accompany them. After the banquet, Huang invited He Yingqin and others to Fengzeyuan for a meeting to exchange preliminary views on the important issues in North China. That night, He also telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, He Zhuguo, and certain other important generals in the front lines, ordering them to come to Beiping immediately to report on the latest situation in the front lines and discuss everything. It is expected that the generals will arrive in Beiping on the 19th. Huang decided to convene a meeting of all members of the Beiping Political Committee at Fengzeyuan on the morning of the 18th to discuss the organization of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. Huang also scheduled to meet with reporters at Fengzeyuan at 10 AM that morning to report on everything. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Grim Prospects for Shantou's Silver Industry <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(Establishment of a White Certificate Management Committee)</p>
<p>Correspondence from Shantou: Shantou's silver industry has been greatly shaken in recent days. Several major silver firms have collapsed one after another. On the 13th, a run on the Tongyu Silver Firm on Haiping Road occurred. The firm had issued 40,000 yuan in banknotes. Fortunately, the Silver Industry Mutual Aid Society provided a sufficient amount of cash to rescue it, averting a grounding. Furthermore, Maotai Grain Store on Fuping Road declared bankruptcy on the 12th, owing a large amount to the street. Baosheng , which owes more than 700,000 yuan due to bankruptcy, has entrusted important figures in the business community to mediate with the debt group. The initial intention was to repay 80% of the debts, but the creditors refused. It is now said that they have agreed to repay the debts in full within one year, divided into four installments. Furthermore, 110,000 yuan of paper money white certificates of Fuan Firm has already had the full amount of money advanced by other firms, turned over to the Chamber of Commerce for redemption, and is gradually recovering paper money and white certificates on the market. The city's money supply is now extremely scarce. The Chamber of Commerce has requested that the Bank of China and the Provincial Bank allow merchants to borrow against real estate to facilitate turnover. The Bank of China must wait for orders from its Shanghai headquarters before daring to release the loan. The Chaozhou silver firms jointly issued 450,000 yuan in white certificates (10,000 yuan each) as an emergency measure. At present, white certificates are prevalent in various markets in Chaozhou and Shantou. The Shantou Exchange Bureau established a White Certificate Management Committee, with the following regulations: "Article 1: This committee is named the Shantou City Exchange Industry Association Guaranteed White Certificate Management Committee. Article 2: The purpose of this committee is to rescue the city's financial market and consolidate the credit of white certificates. Article 3: This committee shall be composed of seven members elected by the general assembly of the Exchange Industry Association to handle all matters of this committee. However, when reviewing property and evaluating prices, the city government and the Chamber of Commerce shall be invited to participate in order to ensure prudence. Article 4: The guaranteed property for the guaranteed white certificates issued by the firms of this committee shall be limited to shops, houses, and open spaces within the city area. The seashore is not guaranteed. However, after the price of the houses and shops is assessed at the current market price, it shall be discounted by 60%, and the open space shall be discounted by 40%. The review and registration procedures are as follows: (1) Registration; (2) Plaque; (3) Notation on the contract. The detailed measures for the above three items shall be determined by the Property Management White Certificate Guarantee Committee. Article 5: If the guaranteed property of each firm falls in value or suffers accidental loss during the period of validity of the white certificate, and this committee believes that the amount guaranteed by the firm is insufficient, the firm shall be ordered to supplement the original amount with other property. Otherwise, the amount of the white certificate shall be reduced. If the firm fails to comply, this committee shall report to the general assembly and terminate the joint guarantee agreement with the firm. Article 6: Each firm in this committee is free to decide whether or not to issue guaranteed white certificates. However, the amount of guaranteed white certificates issued by each firm shall be limited to a minimum of 10,000 yuan and a maximum of 50,000 yuan. The face value of each certificate shall be limited to 100 yuan. Article 7: Within the Property Guarantee White Certificate Joint Guarantee Association, if any firm goes bankrupt, the firms that have issued guaranteed white certificates shall contribute funds in proportion to the amount issued to redeem the certificates. Before the property is auctioned off and the funds are returned, a monthly interest of 1% shall be charged on the advanced funds to ensure fairness. Article 8: The issuance of guaranteed white certificates by this committee is only for temporary relief. The period is limited to three months. They are not redeemable. Every five days, the firms will mutually inspect the certificates to prevent counterfeiting. The matter will be discussed when the period expires. Article 9: These regulations of this committee shall take effect after being passed by the general assembly. Article 10: If there are any deficiencies in these regulations of this committee, they may be amended by the general assembly at any time." (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Jiangsu Provincial Government Reduces Cocoon Industry Business Tax <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Temporarily Collecting 0.2% by Imitating Zhejiang Province's Example)</p>
<p>Correspondence from Zhejiang: The business tax for the cocoon industry in Jiangsu Province was originally stipulated to be 0.5% of business turnover. The provincial government, recognizing that the cocoon industry this year is not prosperous, specially made adjustments to reduce the tax in consideration of the hardships faced by merchants. The provincial government has now decided at a meeting to imitate Zhejiang Province's method and temporarily collect the tax at a rate of 0.2%. The Department of Finance has drafted collection methods and ordered the business tax bureaus in various counties to follow them. The methods are as follows: (1) Because of the quality of cocoons in this province, the cocoon industry business tax is temporarily collected at a rate of 0.2% of business turnover, imitating the methods of Zhejiang Province. (2) The cocoon industry business tax is of a temporary nature. In accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Business Tax Regulations, the value of the goods purchased should be used as the amount of business income, and the business tax should be collected uniformly. (3) Cocoon industry business tax should require the cocoon firms to record the number of dried cocoons returned in detail and pay the tax on behalf of the owners according to the number of bundles. (4) The value of each bundle of dried cocoons this year should be determined by the business tax bureau through market prices, verified and calculated, and reported in advance for record. (5) When opening a cocoon firm, in accordance with the cocoon firm regulations, it should report to the county the number of cocoon stoves and the amount of cocoons to be dried, and obtain a cocoon firm stove permit before being allowed to open for drying cocoons. At the beginning of this year, each cocoon firm should first register with the business tax bureau and apply for an investigation certificate, and then take the investigation certificate to the county government to apply for a cocoon firm stove permit for verification and to prevent tax evasion. The investigation certificate issued by the business tax bureau is specifically for verification purposes and does not cost any money. (6) The cocoon industry association should be responsible for assisting in the verification of the business tax paid on behalf of the cocoon firms. (7) Business tax supervisors and the Public Security Bureau should effectively assist in the collection. (8) The business tax bureau should temporarily assign investigation and collection staff to go to various cocoon firms to verify and collect taxes, and should carefully verify when the cocoon bales are exported to prevent tax evasion. (9) Cocoon industry business tax should be reported and paid separately, and the tax collection receipts used should be kept and returned for verification. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Citizens in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, Protest Taxes and Go on Strike <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(Businessmen in Fuzhou Oppose Arbitrary Valuation of Shop Taxes)</p>
<p>Correspondence from Fuzhou: Since Fujian Province implemented an increase in business tax rates, disputes have repeatedly arisen with merchants. A strike occurred in Xiamen the month before. Recently, a similar strike occurred in Fuqing County, which is under the jurisdiction of Fuzhou Prefecture. All the county's tax bureaus were destroyed, and the situation is particularly serious. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Fuqing is a large coastal county, and many people go abroad to make a living. Commerce is quite prosperous. On the morning of May 6th, the county's business tax bureau sent staff to various businesses to collect business taxes, wanting to increase the tax rate of the Guanjingdou Qianfeng Rice Store, from 2 yuan and 7 jiao per month. The store owner, Liang Zhengqiao, refused to increase the tax, and a dispute occurred. The collecting officers said he was resisting taxes and arrested him, beating him along the way, causing his head to bleed. Onlookers were indignant. After Liang Zhengqiao was interrogated at the bureau, he was sent to the county government for detention, and a team was sent to Qianfeng Rice Store to destroy it and seal it up. This aroused public anger, and the Guanjingdou stores first announced a strike, which quickly spread to the entire city. Hundreds of people gathered and went to the business tax bureau on Pujie Street, dragging out the bureau chief, Zhang Damin, and staff members Song Zhiqian and Wu Hongtong, beating them severely, causing serious injuries. The objects in the bureau were also taken out and burned. At the same time, the slaughter tax bureau, stamp tax bureau, tobacco and alcohol tax bureau, deed tax bureau, and weights and measures inspection station were also destroyed. Each store's entrance was adorned with a paper flag, saying that they would not open until the tax corruption was punished. The silk, Beijing fruit, Jiangsu-Guangdong, fish, and meat trade associations jointly telegraphed the provincial party headquarters, provincial government, and pacification headquarters to report that the business tax bureau had illegally sealed shops, arbitrarily detained and beaten merchants, that public anger was aroused, and that the entire city was on strike, requesting that the situation be stopped to prevent the unrest from escalating. The party, government, and military agencies immediately telegraphed the county's security team, the county government, and the county party headquarters to quickly stop the situation. On the 7th, a joint party, government, military, and business meeting was held to persuade the merchants to open their shops first, and a temporary curfew was announced to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Zhang Damin, the current director of the business tax bureau, went to the province for medical treatment on the 8th and reported the details of the incident. The Department of Finance immediately sent Rao Jingzhong to Fuqing on the 9th to investigate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the merchants in Fuzhou also complained that the property tax bureau collected taxes not based on rent but arbitrarily valued the properties, forcing the merchants to pay. Often, the rent for a store was only a dozen yuan, but the value was estimated to be dozens of yuan, or twenty-odd yuan was estimated to be over a hundred. If they did not pay, they would be accused of concealing taxes and detained with a fine. For example, the Huazhen Jewelry Store on Nandajie Street was fined a huge sum of over 1,700 yuan. A delegation of merchants was organized on the 10th to petition for improvements in the property tax. More than a hundred representatives were elected and went to the county chamber of commerce, asking the chamber of commerce members to go to various agencies to petition. Because no one in the chamber of commerce was responsible for receiving them, public anger arose, and the chamber of commerce building was destroyed before they left. The joint meeting of the research institutes of each shop has now decided that the property tax should be collected based on the amounts recorded in the rent books and account books, and vowed to deny any arbitrary valuation. Yesterday, the property tax bureau issued a leaflet again, ordering merchants who had not paid the taxes to go to the bureau for recognition within two days, or they would be arrested. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Economic Bankruptcy of Rural Shanxi and Suiyuan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Shanxi Provincial Bank Notes Equivalent to Waste Paper</p>
<p>Farmers Cannot Obtain Loans Despite Offering High Interest Rates</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: In this autumn of nationwide production decline and financial stagnation, the economic bankruptcy of rural areas is almost ubiquitous. However, the severity of the situation is most pronounced in Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces. In Suiyuan, years of drought, bandit harassment led by Wang, excessive land tax, and commercial decline have caused the market price of notes issued by the Suiyuan Official Currency Bureau to plummet repeatedly, resulting in a financial crisis on the verge of collapse. Although there was a good harvest last year, low prices hurt farmers and did little to improve people's livelihoods. As for Shanxi, it is due to the impact of years of turmoil, the excessive burden on the people, and the Shanxi Provincial Bank's issuance of sixty to seventy million yuan in banknotes, which were eventually redeemed at a rate of twenty yuan for one, rendering them almost entirely worthless. Various places also have to accommodate guest troops, and there are countless exorbitant taxes and levies. People in Shanxi have always been known for their business acumen, but recently, businesses outside the province have all stopped lending. Not only can they not absorb external wealth, but most of the unemployed cannot find a way to make a living. In addition, in recent years, the number of people addicted to "golden elixir" and morphine has remained high, spreading throughout the province, with an annual outflow of no less than tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, the economic bankruptcy and desolation of Shanxi today is truly unbearable to describe. People in remote counties and villages are especially impoverished, with no place to sell their produce. If they try to borrow money, even with interest rates as high as 8% or 10% per month per yuan, there is nowhere to borrow. Even loans from ordinary merchants require interest rates of 5% or higher, but there are still no transactions. The suffering endured by the people of the Republic of China is even more severe than natural disasters. Yan Xishan previously offered rewards for essays to solve this problem, soliciting public opinion to provide relief. Yesterday, he telegraphed provincial governments and county magistrates in distant provinces, ordering them to investigate the actual conditions in their respective areas, submit detailed relief measures within twenty days, so that [relief could be administered]. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To County Magistrates: I have personally inspected the construction of light railways and personally spoken with villagers, and I am deeply aware that financial stagnation is rampant everywhere, turnover is sluggish, interest rates are high, and farmers feel deeply pained. Inquiries into the causes and relief measures have revealed extreme complexity. It is difficult to obtain appropriate and effective solutions without widely adopting public opinion. Each county magistrate is close to the people and has more direct knowledge. Moreover, there are many insightful people in the countryside. I hope you will investigate the actual conditions in your county and propose relief measures or solicit opinions from people in the countryside, and submit them all to the office within twenty days, so that they can be combined with the solicited essays for consideration. It should be known that today's politics are different from the past. Apart from daily efforts to plan economic construction for the people, there is no such thing as "politics" for officials. I hope you will painfully eliminate the rigid habits of empty politics, concentrate your efforts on the economic aspect to alleviate the people's difficulties. I have been anxious about this matter for a long time. You must pay special attention and not delay in the slightest. This is my earnest hope. Yan Xishan (dated the 12th) Printed (the 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Anhui Province Develops Water Conservancy and Adds Railways <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Water Conservancy Project Plan Formulated</p>
<p>Construction of Wuhu-Zhe Railway Begins</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau reported that the embankment works undertaken by the various district engineering bureaus were nearing completion. However, the aforementioned projects were mostly for disaster prevention, while economic construction should focus on promoting benefits. After the recent water disasters and bandit troubles, production has declined, and the way to remedy this lies in focusing on water conservancy and reviving the countryside. A complete water conservancy project plan has been specially formulated and submitted to the National Economic Commission for overall consideration and approval. However, due to the vast area under its jurisdiction, the bureau fears that it may not be comprehensive enough, so it has sent a general letter to the competent authorities along the river to investigate the following points: (1) Which river sections are most closely related to people's livelihood, what is their length, and how should they be dredged or straightened? (2) Where should culverts be added or gates constructed? (3) Where should revetment projects be built due to turbulent currents? (4) How should the protection and management methods of various embankments be regulated and implemented so that they can be preserved permanently? (5) How should the areas with accumulated water and lower elevation on both sides of the river be reclaimed to become fertile land? (6) What is the planting situation of agricultural products in various places, and is there a need for organization? (7) Have the embankments built by the people in the past been fully completed? What are the reasons for those that have not been restored, and how should they be remedied?</p>
<p>Wuhu to Wanzhi already has the old base of the Ningxiang Railway. However, the section from Wanzhi via Xuancheng to Sunjiabu, which is about 50 kilometers long, still needs to purchase land from the people for construction, which requires a large amount of money. The chief engineer, Hong Shen, has already gone to Shanghai to pass it through the board of directors. As for the steel rails to be used for the railway, 2,000 sections have also been negotiated with Germany and will be shipped to China in about two months. The five locomotives purchased from the Beining Railway have arrived in Pukou a few days ago and will be transported to Wuhu Jiangkou Station for storage within days. The Xuanwu Motor Company, which originally operated on this road, has now changed to the Xuanzhang line. The road also has a plan to imitate the Jingwu road and pave all the stones, which requires about 80,000 yuan in labor and materials. Liu Yiyan, the head of the Anhui Construction Department, specially took a car from Wuhu to inspect the road today. (14th)</p>

<p>(Completion of Datong-Tongguan Railway Project)</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Last winter, Shanxi Province established the Shanxi-Suiyuan Ordnance Road Construction Bureau and the Ordnance Road Construction Training Institute, as well as a purchasing committee and other agencies, to prepare for road construction. Xie Zongzhou, the former head of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, was entrusted to handle the matter. At present, the Yuanping section from Taiyuan to Gouxian in northern Shanxi and the section from Taiyuan to Jiexiu in southern Shanxi are each about 300 li long. Soldiers have been dispatched by the troops stationed along the route to start construction. It is expected that both sections will be completed by the end of this year. After these two sections are connected and opened to traffic, they will continue to be extended in different directions, northward to Datong, directly to PingSui, and southward to Tongguan, connecting to Longhai, completing the planned Datong-Tongguan Railway. In addition to this main line, there are also plans for multiple branch lines, westward to Zekou bordering Shaanxi, and eastward to Jincheng bordering Henan, which will be built in sequence. Regarding the various materials required for road construction, in addition to those manufactured by the Renshen Manufacturing Plant, which was reorganized from the old ordnance factory in this province, the remaining items that cannot be manufactured have been ordered from foreign manufacturers separately. A few days ago, various foreign firms sent personnel to Bing to bid for the contract. After the contract was concluded and the purchase was made, the Ministry of Railways, when it recovered the Zhengtai Railway, planned to use the surplus funds from Zhengtai to repair this route in order to unify the railway administration. A preparatory office for the Datong-Tongguan Railway was established in Yuci, and a foreign engineer, Bo Yan, was appointed as the director to plan in Bing. While in Bing, Bo had several discussions with Yan Xishan and Xie Zongzhou. In order for Yan to formally contact the Central Government and explain Shanxi's plan to build a light railway to avoid misunderstandings, he sent Cui Tingxian, a senior counselor of the Suiyuan Appeasement Office, to Beijing with the entire plan to discuss with the Ministry of Railways. Cui arrived in Beijing and has already been there for over a hundred days. It is reported that a proper agreement has been reached, the main road will still be built by Shanxi Province with military labor, but all engineering plans, etc., will be guided by the Datong-Tongguan Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The Ordnance Road Construction Bureau in Xiyuan will build other branch lines separately. Cui will return to Bing to report and Yan inspected the actual construction of the sections that had started construction. A few days ago, he personally inspected the northern Shanxi section, and yesterday morning he accompanied Xie Zongzhou and Zhang Zhixin, a counselor of the Suiyuan Appeasement Office, and others, taking cars to inspect the southern section projects in Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, Pingyao, Jiexiu, and other counties. It will take about three or two days before they can return to the province. (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Investigation of Basis for Levying Fishing Tax <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Caoking in Punan is a coastal area, and most of the villagers are engaged in fishing. A few days ago, a team claiming to be the First Detachment of the Yangtze River Provincial Water Patrol ordered each fishing boat to pay a flag fee of 30 yuan. Fishermen went to inquire and said that it was reorganized by the Fishery Administration Bureau's Guard and Patrol Team. Because the fishermen could not afford to pay, they opened fire twice and collected 60 yuan, issuing a triangular flag. The matter was known to the county government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to send Chief Inspector Chen to thoroughly investigate. No official documents for fee collection by the Water Patrol Team were found, and no notification was given for assistance. Therefore, a notice was sent to the team to suspend the collection temporarily, and the matter will be handled after the county government receives clear instructions for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Dispute Over Silver Content in a Gold Chain <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Rifeng Silver Shop in Fengle Bridge is a century-old store with a good reputation. The ornaments sold by the shop are marked with a pattern. Yesterday, Xia Yongming, an employee of Quanda Pawnshop, brought a gold chain that was not pawned to exchange. The shop assistant recognized that the chain was indeed produced by the shop. When weighing and paying the price, the shop owner suddenly suspected that the chain was suspicious and might be mixed with other metals, so it should be tested by cutting. After obtaining permission, a base metal was found mixed in the cut part. Xia was shocked and argued with each other. Both parties reported to a branch office. Patrol Officer Liu persuaded them gently. Because both parties were decent businessmen, this matter was related to reputation, he asked them to mediate and settle the case in writing. It is unknown how the counterfeit ornaments with the Rifeng logo originated, which is quite suspicious to the general public.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Opposition to Collecting Fishing Construction Fee <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is collecting fishery construction fees for Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and has established a Taihu Lake Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office in Suzhou to announce the collection. However, this construction fee is borne by each fishing household, and each fishing household is scattered everywhere, so the collection is entrusted to each fish market, which will collect and remit it to the collection office. The fish markets believe that the fishing households are poor and unable to bear the burden, so they refuse to collect it on their behalf and have submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Yesterday (20th), the Fish Market Association specifically notified the industry to postpone the collection on behalf of the fish markets before receiving the Ministry of Finance's approval. It is reported that the fisheries in various counties along Taihu Lake have also expressed the same opinion.</p>

<p>The Meat Industry Association previously received an order from the county government forwarded from the Provincial Construction Department to collect a quarter of the special slaughter donation as a special construction fund. However, the slaughter tax is collected from merchants. Due to years of famine and commercial depression, the pork market is bleak. It is already difficult to collect the regular and supplementary taxes under the education special fund. If the construction donation is increased again, it will be even more difficult. Therefore, a report was submitted to the county government, requesting that it be reviewed and forwarded. Recently, a reply was received, stating that the special fund is of utmost importance and should be collected in accordance with regulations to report.</p>

<p>There is a Baishi Temple near Guhong Bridge in Hongshengli, District 11 (Nanyanshi) of the county, with five or six old and young monks. At about 1:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, a boat suddenly came, with eight or nine bandits on board, holding weapons and landing on the shore in a swarm. They opened the small door on the east side of the temple and entered, tied up all the monks, beat them severely, and forced them to reveal where the silver was hidden. Then they searched arbitrarily for an hour before escaping with their loot. After checking, it was found that silver, clothes, and other items worth more than 300 yuan were robbed. At the same time, Hua Sanlin's family in Huajiawan, Tangkou 396, in the same district, was also robbed by six or seven bandits from Jiangbei, who broke into the house and robbed more than 300 yuan. Wu Dexin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched detective team leader Dai Shouquan, with detectives, to investigate everywhere because of the frequent robbery cases in urban and rural areas. Yesterday, Detective Dai captured a robber named Pan Gen outside the North Gate Gongbei Building, who had robbed Hu Shengquan's family in Bujia Bridge, and took him back to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhu'an Temple in Hengtang Township, District 2 of Wuyi, has been quite wealthy recently, which has attracted the attention of bandits. At about 1:00 a.m. on the 19th, many bandits suddenly came to the temple, climbed over the wall and entered the room, shouting to stop them from making any noise, and tied up and beat the abbess nun Chao Faci, forcing her to ask where the hidden money was. Then they searched and looted all the clothes and cash, etc. Later, they heard a very urgent gong nearby and then fled away with their loot.</p>

<p>There is a Lu who opened a sauce garden south of the General Temple outside the North Gate of Rugao. His wife, whose maiden name is a local of Chahe, has a small stature and a slender figure. After marrying Lu, she was still considered harmonious. They had four or five children one after another. Recently, she suddenly changed her usual state and always went out on the pretext of not returning. There are rumors everywhere, and Lu has heard something about it. However, because of his face, he euphemistically persuaded her. Not only did she not know how to repent, but she intensified. She actually lived with her lover. When Lu saw this situation, he still pretended to be deaf and dumb, hoping that she would repent. Unexpectedly, she fled alone in the early morning of the 16th, while her husband and children were asleep. The eldest son and the youngest daughter looked around for their mother. Now, in addition to sending someone to Chahe to report to her family, Lu also reported to the official government, requesting a manhunt.</p>

<p>Two Japanese warships came to the sea outside the Tianfei Palace in Zhapu, and sailors landed on the shore. In the name of buying fruit, they went along the road where they traveled, drawing the highway routes, tax police posts, and fort positions in the book before boarding the ship and driving away. Unexpectedly, three more ships came the night before, lined up with the previous two in the sea, shaped like a blockade. At night, they used deep-sea lights to illuminate the sea until they left. The residents are uneasy.</p>

<p>Pu Xinshan and other merchants in Linze Town, District 10 of the county, previously reported that Zhang Haixuan, the manager of Dingtai Dangxing in the town, privately sold public security firearms and bullets, embezzling the money. They requested the county government to arrest and interrogate him. Qin Shifang, the district chief of the district, investigated and replied to the county magistrate, but it has been more than a month and there has been no reply. Pu and others have now jointly filed a complaint with the county government, accusing the abandoned district chief of harboring him. It is reported that the county government will send someone to investigate thoroughly.</p>

Before he had gone more than a mile, he suddenly encountered a bandit boat carrying six or seven bandits, who ordered him to stop and jumped onto Xu's boat. After searching for a long time, they only found a few silver dollars. The bandits ordered him to take off his padded robe, but Xu refused to comply, which angered the bandits. They immediately raised their guns and fired at him, hitting his chest. He died immediately. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>Local Armistice Talks in North China Impossible</p>
<p>Factory Inspection Negotiated by Municipal Government</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Find Ways to Relieve Mexican Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who previously went to Beijing to contact important officials, has now completed his official business. He returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the night express train at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The reporter of this newspaper specially interviewed him at the Municipal Government yesterday. Wu absolutely denied the possibility of local armistice talks in North China. The record of his conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Situation in North China <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The reporter first asked about his observation of the situation in North China and the rumors of local armistice talks. Wu resolutely replied that, judging from the current situation in North China, the rumors of compromise, etc., are all fabricated by the other side. As for the armistice talks, he also believes that they are absolutely impossible. The Japanese army's current temporary truce is, on the one hand, necessary for military reorganization, and at the same time, due to President Roosevelt's declaration expressing a firm attitude and being completely consistent with the League of Nations, the Japanese side is ultimately concerned. As for the safety of Peiping and Tianjin, he believes that although the Japanese army has no intention of peeking for the time being, it will eventually use traitors to actively disrupt the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Factory Inspection <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the inspection rights of factories in the concessions, which is related to the entire labor administrative sovereignty of our country, the Municipal Government will never give up. While in Beijing, he repeatedly consulted with the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It was decided that within the scope of not damaging our country's sovereignty and maximizing the protection of labor welfare principles, the Municipal Government will be responsible for starting negotiations with the Bureau of Works and frankly discussing a cooperative approach.</p>

<p>As for the Postal Economic System Research Association, the discussion on the postal economic system reform plan has been basically determined after several meetings. Only the issue of personnel after the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau has caused slight differences in opinion between the two sides, resulting in a temporary suspension of the meeting. While in Beijing, he repeatedly met with Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Transportation to exchange views. It has now been decided to start with the mediation of all parties to make the opinions of all parties tend to be consistent, and then continue the meeting. Minister Zhu is scheduled to come to Shanghai at the end of this month, and the meeting is expected to be convened at that time.</p>

<p>Regarding the Mexican anti-Chinese incident and the measures to relieve Mexican overseas Chinese returning to the country, he also discussed and decided on measures with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Beijing. In terms of negotiations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send high-ranking officials to Mexico to seriously negotiate with the Mexican government to thoroughly resolve the issue. As for relief, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will send personnel to Shanghai to work with the local authorities to find ways to deal with the resettlement and repatriation of overseas Chinese returning to Shanghai, and the government and private parties will allocate funds to maintain the livelihood of the expelled overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Sun Ke Denied Compromise Between China and Japan Upon Returning to Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Temporary Truce on the Front is a Natural Trend</p>
<p>We Will Never Give Up Our Long-Term Resistance Policy</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday with his mother. Reporters from various newspapers specially interviewed him at his residence on Columbia Road yesterday. Sun firmly denied the rumors that China and Japan were about to compromise and said that the current temporary truce was caused by the international atmosphere and natural trends. A record of Sun's conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e104">Denying Compromise <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Sun first said that since Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Peiping, went north, the atmosphere of peace was strong, but the rumors that China and Japan would compromise, etc., were not credible. The government has long made concrete decisions on the military issue of resisting Japan, but unfortunately, it cannot be fully implemented due to various reasons. As for the telegram from Peiping stating that a truce method will be discussed under mutual understanding, he had not heard of it while in Beijing. In short, China and Japan will never compromise.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Temporary Truce <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The current international atmosphere has changed suddenly since President Roosevelt's declaration was issued. Japan is therefore concerned and dare not rashly attack Peiping and Tianjin. Our side is also temporarily unable to counterattack due to strategic relations. All these reasons may create a de facto truce. However, this situation is temporary and not permanent. The creation of this situation has nothing to do with the resolution of major issues, nor is there any understanding or agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Peiping and Tianjin Safe <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the safety of Peiping and Tianjin, the Japanese army has gradually advanced in recent days, and the situation is becoming more and more serious. However, according to Sun's talk, although the situation in Peiping and Tianjin is becoming serious, war is not likely to break out. However, disguised occupation, such as secretly sending traitors to take advantage of the opportunity to riot and disrupt public security, is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Southwest Issues <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government is determined to resist Japan and suppress bandits, so it has consulted with the Southwest authorities to assist in suppressing the Gan bandits. After repeated discussions, it has been decided that the leaders of the Southwest will cooperate to assist the Central Government in suppressing the remnant bandits in Jiangxi Province within a short period of time. Although national affairs are urgent, there is nothing that cannot be done. Chen Mingshu, the former Minister of Transportation, has returned to China and transferred to Fujian from Hong Kong. It is reported that Chen will temporarily live in Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Xinjiang Disputes <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government has sent Huang Musong to Xinjiang to handle the disputes. Huang was unable to leave immediately due to illness and will be able to leave in a few days. As for the issue of the reorganization of the provincial government in the province, the Muslims have expressed dissatisfaction with the current provincial government, and reorganization may be possible. At present, the actual situation in the province is difficult to understand due to the lack of direct reports due to poor telegram communication. Xinjiang is an important place in the west, with a large area and abundant resources, which cannot be ignored. It is hoped that the people and government of the country will pay attention to the development of the border areas. As for the war in Sichuan Province, which broke out again in the midst of national disaster, it is very hateful.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Drafting the Constitution <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the drafting of the constitution, Commissioner Wu Jingxiong and others are responsible for carrying it out, and the first draft is about to be completed. As for the provision in the draft constitution that active servicemen shall not be appointed as presidents, a decision has not yet been made and is under study. Legislator Zhang Zhiben is unable to go to Beijing immediately due to various reasons, but his resignation has long been withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e110">National Congress <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional National Congress has been scheduled to be convened in Beijing on July 1, and representatives from various places have been elected one after another. It is hoped that the Southwest will send representatives to Beijing to participate at that time. As for the rumors that the Southwest will convene a separate conference, there is no actual report and it is believed to be untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Long-Term Resistance <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Because of the many rumors in recent days, the reporter asked Sun whether the Central Government had abandoned its previous long-term resistance policy. Sun replied that it had not been abandoned and would resist to the end. However, at this time, internal unity is urgently needed to jointly plan the progress. As for the rumors that the Japanese side intends to prevent the government from supporting the anti-Japanese guerrillas and that they will all be eliminated, Sun said that they are not true. All the Northeast Volunteer Army that can form an army have been reorganized by the Central Government into formal troops. The rest are still guerrillas who have not formed an army, or are not accepted for reorganization, or the government is unable to reach them, and there are also those who do not listen to orders, but their strength is also very weak.</p>

<p>Xiao Zhenying telegraphed from Peiping, saying: (Title omitted) To all gentlemen, in recent days, the various troops in eastern Luan have been retreating step by step and are in a state of collapse. Song's department of the 29th Army has reluctantly obeyed repeated telegraph orders. On the one hand, they are struggling to support and cover the retreat of all parties. On the other hand, they are strictly controlling the last front line of Peiping and Tianjin. Our army has fought bloody battles for two months, sacrificing more than 10,000 people, but due to environmental constraints, all previous achievements have been abandoned. The soldiers are grief-stricken and almost unwilling to live. No matter how difficult it is, we must defend Peiping to prevent the enemy from fleeing south. Respectfully reported, Xiao Zhenying bows down.</p>

<p>Yang Dianhua's unit, the 8th Route Commander of the Anti-Japanese National Army in Jehol, which is currently stationed in the Zhangjiakou area, is unwilling to be oppressed by the enemy and has gathered the people to rise up and resist Japan. After many fierce battles, they have repeatedly won great victories. Recently, they have also established contact with the 41st Army and will prepare to counterattack. Recently, they sent a representative, Sheng Yuezhuang, to Shanghai to report the truth to all walks of life. Sheng will be stationed in Shanghai on a regular basis and insists on not soliciting donations from the outside world.</p>

<p>Mr. You Yinqiao of Guangdong, has a long-standing reputation in Shanghai's business circles. He has only one son, named Long, also known as You Hua, aged twenty-two. He graduated from St. Francis Xavier's College and is proficient in both Chinese and English. He is married with a three-year-old son. You Long works for a trust company, earning a considerable monthly income, and his family life is quite pleasant. However, Mr. You is filled with patriotism. Since the outbreak of Japanese aggression against our country, he has been filled with grief and indignation, vowing to join the army and fight the enemy, but unfortunately, he had no opportunity. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. You also worked in the rear. Recently, Luanzhou fell and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger. Mr. You, being young and passionate, felt even more enraged. Therefore, a few days ago, he secretly left his family, claiming he was going out, and went north to join the army. His family noticed he had been gone for many days and became extremely anxious. Then, yesterday, they suddenly received a letter from him from Beiping, only to learn that he had gone north to join the army and was attached to the First Training Team of the Weng Army. He will soon depart for the front line, and advised his family not to worry, saying he will only return after killing all the Japanese invaders.</p>

<p>Ms. Xie Yiqing, wife of General Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, arrived in Shanghai the night before last. According to Liu Piguang, Li Du's representative in Shanghai, the dependents of the officers of Li's army will remain in Shanghai temporarily due to crowded trains. All food and lodging issues will still be taken care of by Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, representatives of the United Association for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees stationed in Peiping. As for Mrs. Li Du, she has decided to stay in Shanghai to await General Li Du.</p>

<p>Previously, with the fall of Yuguan and the subsequent fall of Rehe, the refugees in the war zone were suffering immensely, especially women and children. The Shanghai Chinese Ciyou Association, responsible for caring for orphans, could not bear to stand idly by. The association's executive committee appointed Zhao Jinqing (Chairman), Li Ting'an, Zhu Lide, Fei Wusheng, and Chen Tiesheng to form a War Zone Orphan Relief Committee. Chen Tiesheng was sent to Miyun, Changli Haiyang Town, Qinhuangdao, and Luanzhou to unite with local political, business, and religious leaders to organize shelters and establish Ciyou branch associations. He also worked with enthusiastic people from all walks of life in Peiping and Tianjin, such as Zhou Dawen, Yong Jianqiu, Zhang Boling, Chilton, and Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, representatives of the Shanghai Charity Organizations' United Association for Relief of Northeastern Refugees stationed in Peiping, to plan for contingencies in the event of further developments in the situation. After completing his work, he returned to Shanghai and reported the situation and the conditions in the war zone to various organizations and groups, which garnered much sympathy and substantial financial assistance from various quarters. Recently, as Peiping and Tianjin become increasingly dangerous and the number of refugees increases, Mr. Chen has decided to go north again today for emergency relief. When necessary, he plans to send Wang Guan to provide guidance on educational affairs in various locations.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Date of the Soviet Russian Inspection Group's Trip is Still Far Off <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Affected by Russia's Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Threat to Peiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>Two Matters Must Be Resolved Before Finance Minister Song Can Return to Make the Trip Possible</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the industrial and financial circles of Shanghai, is preparing to organize a Soviet Russian Industrial Inspection Group to visit Soviet Russia to inspect the latest state of Soviet Russian industry in order to prepare for expanding trade with Russia. This matter has already been discussed and settled in Beijing by Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, and Bogomolov, Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, and preparations are underway to organize the group. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited relevant personnel of the Ministry of Industry yesterday to inquire about the details. According to the response, this matter is still affected by other factors, and the date of its realization will be after the autumn coolness. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organization: It was stated that since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, trade between the two countries has stagnated and been seized by other countries, which has been detrimental to both sides. After China and Russia announced the resumption of diplomatic relations, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry initiated the organization of this group, on the one hand to prepare for trade with Russia, and on the other hand to learn from the Soviet Russian experience to revitalize our country's industry. On the government side, personnel will be sent by the Ministries of Industry and Finance, while private industrial and financial groups can participate freely at their own expense. It is now heard that the city's Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and those engaged in import and export, such as the soybean, silk, tea, and timber industries, are all willing to join the group and go for inspection.</p>
<p>Influence: This matter, after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, could have been realized earlier if a Sino-Russian commercial treaty could have been signed smoothly. However, recently, because Soviet Russia disregarded the treaty and sold the Chinese Eastern Railway, jointly owned by China and Russia, to the puppet Manchuria, this act greatly hinders Sino-Russian relations. Therefore, the consultation on the Sino-Russian commercial treaty has to be delayed, which indirectly affects the inspection group. Moreover, the Japanese army is constantly invading, and Peiping and Tianjin are in imminent danger. The state of the country is so precarious that the progress of the inspection group cannot proceed as desired.</p>
<p>Implementation: The inspection group is expected to be costly, and the Ministry of Industry cannot bear it alone. It must wait for Finance Minister Song to return to the country to plan the funds before it can be realized. Currently, Finance Minister Song is on his way to England and there is no definite date for his return. Furthermore, the aforementioned military and diplomatic issues must also be resolved. Waiting for all matters to be settled, the estimated date for the trip to Russia for inspection is expected to be after the autumn season.</p>

<p>The Shanghai German Association and the German Chamber of Commerce's protest to the China League for Civil Rights states: The China League for Civil Rights is known for opposing all matters and events except for the reactionary situation within Soviet Russia. Our associations originally did not need to pay much attention to its declarations. Its persistence is so appalling that even after strong evidence has been provided and the "brutal propaganda" has long degenerated into despicable slander, it still has so-called brutal propaganda against Germany, which we cannot completely ignore. The neutral reports of witnesses from various countries, such as former U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Sackett, the Italian Royal Adjutant Duke Herzog Tmperiali, Mr. Vernon Bartlett, and others, are more than enough for our associations to cite. From our investigation, we are pleased that most of the daily newspapers in this city do not consider this regrettable incident to be worth discussing. May 18, 1933, The Shanghai German Association, The Shanghai German Chamber of Commerce.</p>

It was resolved: (a) To send a telegram to the Tianjin Municipal Government to uphold justice; (b) To send a reply. (3) A request from a certain secret organization to investigate the case of hatred of goods. It was resolved to handle it together with item one. (4) A petition from the workers of the Dazhong Rubber Factory regarding the factory's destruction of the labor union and unjustified closure, requesting assistance. It was resolved to have the investigation department send personnel to investigate.

<h3 id="e120">Japanese Police Interfere with Customs Officers' Inspections, Customs Protests Verbally <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate Has Ordered Corrective Measures</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The Chief Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Maze, has recently received reports from foreign customs officers that armed police dispatched by the Japanese Police Department at the Hongkou Mail Steamer Wharf have been acting tyrannically, obstructing customs personnel from carrying out inspections, and causing much hindrance to customs inspection duties, requesting that the matter be addressed and corrected. After investigation, it was confirmed to be true. The Chief Commissioner of Customs Maze sent personnel to the Japanese Consulate General the day before yesterday to lodge a verbal protest, demanding that all unreasonable interference by the Japanese police be stopped to avoid hindering customs inspection duties, because the Japanese police at the wharf not only do not assist customs personnel, but often prevent customs officers from searching Japanese mail steamers and the luggage of Japanese passengers. Such a situation is extremely unreasonable and should be corrected. After receiving the report, the Japanese Consul General summoned the Chief of the Japanese Police Department, Mr. Hanari, to inquire about the situation. In addition to deciding to reprimand the Japanese police for arbitrarily interfering with customs officers' actions, the Consulate General also dispatched several senior police officers to patrol the wharves in shifts to assist customs personnel in performing their duties at any time. If it is found that Japanese police are protecting passengers and obstructing inspections, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3 id="e121">University Professors Joint Association Advises the Soviet Government <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Based on Treaties and Facts</p>
<p>Explaining the Pros and Cons, and the Higher Meaning</p>
<p>Opposing the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors Joint Association held its seventh standing committee meeting yesterday at 3 PM. Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Jixin, Lin Zhongke, Kang Xuanyi, Qiu Hanping, Jiang Zhensan, Li Shengwu (Qiu as proxy) were present. Zhang Shouyong chaired and Kang Xuanyi recorded. Matters discussed included: (1) A draft letter to the Russian Ambassador to be forwarded to the Soviet Government was amended and passed. (2) Adding members to the Education Funding Independence Movement Committee. It was resolved to add twelve people, including Li Shizeng. (3) A letter of thanks to Committee Member Xi Wei for soliciting prizes for the essay contest. (4) Revising the methods of benefiting members. (5) The cultural introduction and other three forms were handed over to the investigation section. (6) A letter from Zhongwai Bookstore requesting an introduction to the eye-witness account of the fall of Rehe, which was handed over to the document section for handling. (7) The association's proposal to hire legal counsel will have its candidates re-examined. The association issued the following letter to the Russian Ambassador to be forwarded to the Soviet Government:</p>
<p>Your Excellency the Soviet Ambassador to China, and please forward it to your government: Relations between China and Russia were interrupted for several years, and both sides suffered losses in their interests. Later, due to the demands of the international situation and the urging of public opinion, and with the efforts of diplomacy, we were able to restore friendly relations. The people of both countries rejoiced and earnestly hoped that we could work together hand in hand to seek the welfare of mankind. Unfortunately, within less than a month of the restoration of diplomatic relations, the ambassador's credentials had just been delivered, and the commercial treaty had not yet been negotiated, your government announced the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which has greatly disappointed our country and is deeply regrettable. The Eastern Railway is an economic enterprise jointly run by the two countries. Eighty years after the railway's completion and opening to traffic, the railway industry will be transferred to Chinese ownership without compensation. Within thirty-six years, China has the right to redeem it at a price (see Article 12 of the Sino-Russian Railway Company Contract of 1896). The Sino-Russian Agreement of 1924 also solemnly stipulated that the future of the Eastern Railway depends on China and Russia and that no other country has the right to interfere (according to Article 7 of the agreement). Furthermore, according to Article 4 of the agreement, the governments of China and Russia solemnly declare that they will not conclude any treaties or agreements that harm the sovereignty and interests of the other party. All these facts have treaties as evidence, and there is no room for unilateral destruction. The unilateral reasons held by your country are nothing more than that our country failed to participate in the administration of the Eastern Railway after the September 18th Incident, and thus lost its rights and position in the Eastern Railway. This kind of argument is greatly contrary to your country's consistent policy. Japan temporarily seizes our country's territory with violence, which all countries regard as illegal, while your country calls for supporting small northern ethnic groups and advocates international peace. How can you want to assist Japan while our country is resisting Japan with all its might? I don’t know how you will justify your actions. This action not only affects our country's sovereignty, but also your country will lose sympathy in the international community. If your country believes that temporary violent seizure can become a permanent legal occupation, then the Paris Peace Conference after the European War could have maintained the original state before the war, and the map of Europe would not have needed treaty revision. Alsace and Lorraine would not have needed to be returned. Even when your country was in the midst of revolution, it did not participate in the administration of the Eastern Railway for a long time, but our country did not use this to deny your country's rights. When the Eastern Railway Incident occurred in 1929, your country also sent an ultimatum stating that our country could not unilaterally dispose of the Eastern Railway. The words are still fresh in our ears, but now you are going back on your word, contradicting yourself, and making things worse, from disposition to sale, which has never happened before in history and must not be taken by your country. Even if your country recalls its previous words, how will it explain itself? The International Postal Union is seeking ways to resist the postal transport of the puppet organizations, but your country is now selling the railway, which is tantamount to helping the tiger do evil and is deeply disliked by the wise. I guess that the reason why your country has taken this wrong approach is to avoid conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in order to maintain peace in East Asia, but in fact, it only increases disputes. The sale of the Eastern Railway will definitely become a major disaster for your country's national defense, and the threat will become even greater. Since the outbreak of Japanese militarism, the government's budget has long been stretched thin due to its excessive military spending, which has exhausted the people's resources. How can it have the surplus funds? The reason why it is willing to collect huge sums of money to contribute to the Chinese Eastern Railway is nothing more than that the country is using this to liquidate the old debts of the Tsarist regime. If your country falls into this trap, it will be tantamount to creating troubles for itself and shaking the foundation of the country. Our association carefully considers and weighs the pros and cons, and dares to offer sincere advice. I hope that your country will not cause endless disasters for a moment of temporary peace, and that Sino-Russian relations will not repeat the same mistakes. Please quickly forward this message to your government, and according to the founding policy of your country, resolutely abandon this extremely wrong proposition, which will not only be the good fortune of the future of China and Russia. With all due respect, The Shanghai University Professors Joint Association of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Hoping for a Central Government Resolution</p>
<p>The two Sichuan representatives in Shanghai, Deng and Fu, received a telegram from Liu Xiang yesterday, which read: To Brothers Deng Mingjie and Fu Zhenwu, Regarding the conflict between the 24th and 28th Armies in Sichuan Province, fighting has already begun between Pi County and Guankou, and Xinjin County. Our army has repeatedly mediated, and yesterday we sent a cold telegram to the two army commanders, Liu and Deng, which read, "Recently, according to provincial reports, the two armies are approaching each other, and war has broken out, causing shock and panic. Although each side has its own version of the start of the conflict, the outbreak of war has indeed occurred. At a time when foreign enemies are invading, and we should be uniting to resist foreign aggression, how can we engage in fratricidal strife and forget the lessons of internal discord? Moreover, the remnants of the Red Bandits in the Sichuan River have not been eliminated, and the people are suffering immensely. How can we bear the burden of war again? If the war spreads and lasts for a long time, not only will the local area be devastated, but the bandits will also seize the opportunity. You two are wise and need no further explanation. I urge you to dispel suspicions and cease fighting immediately. Even if you win in fratricidal strife, it is not glorious. The loss of the country and the destruction of the nation are imminent. All my comrades should be fearful. We must first abandon suspicions and restore harmony before we can turn danger into safety. Even if there are difficulties, we should wait patiently for the central government to resolve them. The future of the homeland depends on you. I send this telegram in detail and hope for your clear instruction." In addition to telegraphing to the central government, I hereby inform you. Liu Xiang bows respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Trial Period for the Cotton Mill Production Cuts Has Ended <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>With No Improvement, Each Factory Will Decide Its Own Measures</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the National Cotton Mill Association decided to cut production by 23 percent, starting on the 22nd of last month, for a one-month trial period to regulate the production and sales of cotton yarn. After the implementation, there was no improvement. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, a second discussion was held. Everyone believed that the low price of yarn and the lack of sales led to the accumulation of goods and economic difficulties, which could not be solved by production cuts. Moreover, the proposed assistance measures after submitting a request to the government are not a fundamental solution. As the situation of each factory is different, no further decisions can be made to force each factory to implement it uniformly. It was decided that after the one-month trial period expires, each factory will consider its own situation and decide on measures. Yesterday was the last day of the trial period. The reporter specially went to the Cotton Mill Association to inquire. According to its person in charge, it is not yet known whether each factory will continue to implement production cuts after the expiration or will restore the original state, or even shut down completely. As the situation of each factory is different, each factory will implement its own measures arbitrarily, making it difficult to obtain accurate statistics. In short, the situation has not been alleviated, and those who restore the original state will be limited to a few factories with relatively strong financial resources. As for the impact of the increase in tariffs on Japanese yarn after the expiration of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, it is not significant. There are many Japanese factories in China, centered on Shanghai, and their sales channels are in the Yellow River basin and the northern provinces, where Chinese yarn is almost extinct. The impact of competition is not small. Therefore, Japanese businessmen are very optimistic about the yarn industry, and pay special attention to the production and sales of fine yarn, while Chinese businessmen are in a precarious situation. If the government does not have fundamental measures, and the people do not make efforts to promote it, the serious situation cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>Four Items to Note</p>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau, in order to measure the household lands of the twenty-third bao, second and fifteenth tu of Yinhang District, and to inform all property owners to go to fill out forms and receive measurements, has issued a special announcement, saying: For the matter of the announcement, the bureau is now starting to measure the household lands of the twenty-third bao, second and fifteenth tu of Yinhang District. All property owners should pay attention to the following items: (1) The local保 (baos) will distribute filling forms to the property owners. Each property owner should, within ten days after receiving the form, truthfully fill it out and return it to the local 保 (bao) to collect and submit to the second measurement team of the bureau at 70 Tongjia Road, or the property owner can directly submit it to the measurement team. (2) If a property owner's address is unknown, resulting in the filling form not being distributed and not received, they can directly fill out the form at the bureau or the second measurement team. (3) If a property owner's land deed is pledged out, making it impossible to fill in the name of the household and the mu (畝) acreage of the land, they should immediately copy it from the pledgee and not shirk responsibility. (4) When each household's land is measured, the property owner must, together with the local 保 (bao), clearly point out the boundaries in all four directions to the investigators and measurers, or entrust a representative to point out the boundaries on the spot in advance. Otherwise, the bureau will only rely on the instructions of the local 保 (bao). If any errors or disputes arise in the future, the property owner will be responsible. The above four items are all related to the consolidation of property rights. In addition to instructing the local 保 (baos) of the said tu to comply, it is imperative to announce it to all so that each property owner pays special attention to it. This announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e130">China National Aviation Corporation Regularly Holds Board Meetings <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China National Aviation Corporation is scheduled to hold its nineteenth board meeting at 9:30 am next Monday (the 22nd), at which it will report and decide on opening routes to Chongqing, Chengdu, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The details are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Board Meeting The nineteenth board meeting is scheduled to be held at 9 am on the 22nd. Notices have been issued. Most of the Chinese and American directors are in Shanghai and can attend. It is not yet known whether Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications, and Shen Shu-hua, Director-General of General Affairs, will come to Shanghai to attend. The meeting will discuss various internal affairs, and the preparations for the trial flights of the Shanghai-Guangzhou route will be submitted for approval. However, the opening and establishment costs of the Shanghai-Guangzhou line will be approximately one million yuan. Therefore, whether the unpaid capital will be continued to be paid by China and the United States will also be discussed.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Beiping Line Recently, Tianjin and Beiping have been very panicked. The Shanghai-Beiping air route is one of the important transportation routes. According to the person in charge of the company, the line will not be suspended unless absolutely necessary. The head of the flight department has been sent to Beiping next Tuesday to preside over the matter. Mr. Bandi will return to Shanghai next week to report.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangzhou Line The Shanghai-Guangzhou line is expected to begin trial flights in early July. Offices are being established in various ports in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, and radio stations are being installed. However, due to the prosperity of commerce and the high land prices in various ports, a large amount of land is needed. Therefore, floating pontoons, ferry boats, and docks needed for landing on the sea are being actively prepared. Moreover, since the Shanghai-Guangzhou line is longer and there are many merchants and travelers, two twin-engine amphibious aircraft will be ordered.

<p>A previous report stated that Ding Muhuan held an official position in the puppet state. It has been found that this is Ding Muhuan from Fengtian, not Ding Muhuan from Wuxi, the former director of the Aviation Administration. Recently, rumors have spread that Mr. Ding's house has been sealed. This is completely inaccurate. According to Mr. Ding Fubao, he recently inquired about this matter with General Zhu Ziqiao. General Zhu said that he often met with Mr. Ding Muhuan from Wuxi in Beiping recently. The person holding an official position in the puppet state is actually someone else. The rumors circulating outside are mostly misunderstandings, and there is no such thing as a house being sealed.</p>

<p>Tian Huan, compiler of the Central Party History and advisor to the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, is also a famous calligrapher and painter in recent times. He once sold his books in Shanghai, and those who obtained his paintings and writings treasured them as priceless gems. He was famous throughout the country. In the winter of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, President Sun telegraphed him to go to Guangdong for revolutionary affairs. After that, he traveled north and south as an official, and had no time for this. The flood in Hubei two years ago was extremely severe. He Chengbing, chairman of the province, organized a flood relief committee and hired him as a committee member stationed in Shanghai, requesting him to launch a national calligraphy and painting relief effort and requesting him to sell his books for one month. All the proceeds were used for flood relief. At that time, those who admired Tian's calligraphy and painting eagerly requested them, and there was a situation where he could not handle them all. Before long, he obtained a large sum of money and handed it over to the association as agreed. It is a pity that the time limit was too short, and those who cherished Tian's calligraphy lamented. This time he returned to Shanghai and plans to sell his books in his spare time. The price list is being rushed to be printed and will be published in various newspapers after it is printed. It is heard that the receiving address is 72 Yongyu Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, and major stationery and fan shops in the city.</p>

<p>Crew and Passengers Fortunately All Safe</p>
<p>Loss of Approximately 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The He'an Wheel of the He'ai Wheel Company of Wai Xiang Gua Street in Nanshi, which set sail from Shanghai to Amoy yesterday morning, collided with the Johanne Justesen (transliteration) of the Norwegian merchant Da Feng Company while passing near Gaoqiao at about 9 o'clock. The He'an Wheel immediately sank. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Circumstances of the Collision <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The He'an Wheel loaded a large amount of grain and passengers at floating pontoon numbers 6 and 7 at Nan Wharf at 7:30 yesterday morning and set sail for Sandu, Amoy. At 9:40, while passing through location number 4 and 5 near Gaoqiao, it encountered a Norwegian ship of the Da Feng Company entering from Wusong, which did not follow the shipping lane and sailed straight. According to the Huangpu River shipping lane, outgoing ships should sail on the left side of the Huangpu River, and incoming ships should sail on the right side (that is, the west side of the Huangpu River). The He'an Wheel saw the Norwegian ship sailing into the same shipping lane and being very close, fearing the danger of a collision, so it urgently sounded the horn. The Norwegian ship also sounded the horn, but did not move to avoid the He'an Wheel then turned towards Pudong. Because it was close to the shoals, it was unable to accelerate, so it had to slightly turn the bow of the ship in the hope of avoiding danger.</p>
<h3 id="e147">He'an Sunk in Collision <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>One side urgently sounded the horn, while at the same time quickly turned the ship, but the Norwegian ship, for some reason, continued to rush straight down, so it was unable to avoid the collision. The He'an Wheel was hit with great force below the waterline of the stern, and river water poured into the cabin. The shipowner, upon learning of the collision, rushed to Pudong Shoal, but the entire ship sank to the bottom of the river in less than five minutes. After causing the accident, the Norwegian ship continued to sail to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Rescue Status <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>When the He'an was sunk in the collision, a customs river patrol vessel happened to pass by and sailed close to the ship for rescue. A small Asia Petroleum Storage vessel nearby heard the plea for help and also rushed to the side of the ship to assist the customs vessel in the rescue. Therefore, the crew and passengers were completely rescued without any injuries. After the He'an Wheel had an accident, the crew and passengers were rescued with the help of customs and Asia Petroleum Storage vessels. The shipowner then reported to the customs and sent the river management department to inspect the scene of the accident. After learning of the accident, the shipping administration bureau also sent personnel to inspect.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Company Negotiations <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Hetae Company only received the report of the He'an Wheel being sunk by the Da Feng Norwegian Wheel at noon yesterday. It immediately sent a letter to negotiate, but because yesterday was Saturday, the company stopped working in the afternoon, so there was no reply until the evening. As a result, the goods in the ship could not be salvaged. Today is also Sunday, so it will be necessary for both parties to send personnel to jointly inspect tomorrow before salvage can begin.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Heavy Losses <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The wheel weighs 1,100 tons. This time, it was sailing from Shanghai to Sandu, Amoy. In addition to carrying 38 passengers, the ship contained a large amount of grain, including more than 6,000 bags of indica rice, 12,000 bags of flour, about 1,500 bags of soybeans, and local cloth and miscellaneous goods, worth about 150,000 yuan. The ship price was also more than 90,000 yuan. The total loss this time is about 250,000 yuan. After the passengers were rescued and returned to Shanghai, the company immediately refunded their tickets. The sinking location of the wheel obstructs the shipping lane, so it is urgent to find a way to salvage it. However, before the two parties have inspected it, it is not convenient to move it because it is related to future negotiations. At high tide, only the flagpole and chimney of the wheel can be seen. At low tide, the river bank is also exposed on the surface of the water.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Yu Yongkang Sues Stepmother to Confirm Status as Adopted Son <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Raised and Married Off by Adoptive Father</p>
<p>With Witnesses Available from that Time to Testify</p>
<p>| Debate Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 25th |</p>
<p>Yu Ying, a woman from Ningbo, Yin County, residing at No. 18, Huayan Lane, Maite Hesitu Road, is already in her fifties. Her husband, Yu Caixing, formerly the head foreman in the weaving room of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, passed away last winter, leaving behind a million in assets, all controlled by Mrs. Yu. However, Yu Caixing had previously adopted Yongkang, the son of his elder brother Dingfu, as his heir, raised him to adulthood, and even arranged his marriage. Unexpectedly, Yu Ying now suddenly denies Yongkang's status as an adopted son. Yongkang, in order to preserve his rightful name and rights, has filed a lawsuit against his stepmother in the First Special District Court. Initially, he requested mediation, but when that failed, he formally filed a lawsuit. His complaint states that when the plaintiff was eight years old, Caixing, having no children of his own, obtained the consent of his biological father, Dingfu, to adopt the plaintiff as his heir. He was immediately taken in and raised to adulthood, and Caixing even arranged his marriage, acting as the officiant. All of this can be proven by witnesses from that time. Dingfu was previously the head foreman in the weaving room of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, and was diligent and cautious in his work, highly valued by the factory's chief engineer. Later, when the chief engineer returned to his home country, he gave Dingfu a letter of recommendation. After Dingfu's death, his adoptive father, Caixing, used the letter to take his place, claiming that they had the same work experience, and was thus able to become the head foreman, accumulating a great deal of wealth over more than twenty years. Last year, the adoptive father passed away, and all the property is now managed by the defendant. The plaintiff has legally asserted his rights, but the defendant has ignored the facts and denied the plaintiff's status as Caixing's heir. However, the plaintiff's adoption is clearly evidenced, and is well known to relatives and friends. The facts are clear, and cannot be arbitrarily denied. Therefore, he respectfully requests that the court swiftly summon witnesses and render a judgment confirming the plaintiff's status as Yu Caixing's heir, so as to ensure the proper ancestral rites, etc. After being sued, Yu Ying also hired a lawyer to file a defense. Li Hu, the presiding judge of the civil court of the First Special District Court, held a hearing on May 13th, summoning both the plaintiff and defendant, as well as witnesses, for examination. According to Yu Yongkang's testimony, "My biological father died when I was nine years old. My wife was chosen for me by my adoptive father. The matchmaker is still alive and can testify." The defendant, Yu Ying, consistently denied the adoption. All witnesses from both sides were questioned one by one. Yesterday morning, the court continued to question the witnesses, and then the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Peiyuan, and the defendant's representative, Lawyer Huang, concluded their arguments. Judge Li announced that the judgment would be pronounced on the 25th of this month.</p>

<p>Chenjia Baizhang Village is located about six li southwest of Dachang Town in Baoshan County, close to Zhenru. It faces south and backs north, with about fifty households. To the east is a small bridge, a winding dirt road leading to Dachang Town. There are no villages nearby around the village. Most of the villagers live by farming, with spinning and weaving as secondary occupations.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Details of the Robbery <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, during a heavy downpour with thunder and lightning, more than ten robbers speaking with a Jiangsu-Zhejiang accent suddenly arrived, each armed with pistols, Mauser pistols, rifles, and so on. They swarmed into the home of Chen Mingguang, the township head and first platoon leader of the ninth Jia of the defense corps. Chen had already gone to bed, but the gate was not locked. Chen had two younger brothers who, although they lived separately, still resided in the same house, which had three courtyards. Chen lived in the back courtyard. When the robbers entered, they took temporary shelter in the gatehouse due to the heavy rain. There was a bicycle parked in the gatehouse, and one of the robbers started playing with the bicycle wheel, which Chen heard. Chen immediately got up and shouted, but the robbers took the opportunity to rush in, drag Chen to the courtyard entrance, and shoot him several times with a Mauser pistol, killing him. His wife, Zhang, hearing her husband's silence, ran out of bed. However, she was shot in the abdomen with a pistol at the entrance to the main room, also killing her. Seeing that Chen and his wife were both dead, the robbers then went to search the bedrooms.</p>

<p>A total of fifty yuan in cash and silver were taken from the deceased's body. From the deceased's room, a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, two silk-faced leather coats, two silk-lined jackets, and a silk skirt were stolen. Robbing the room of the deceased's eldest son, the robbers learned that Chen was the platoon leader of the defense corps, so they first ordered his son to hand over the firearms. The son, named Hexin, could not resist and had to give the firearms to the robbers. These included a Type 38 rifle with 500 rounds of ammunition, and a Russian rifle with 200 rounds of ammunition, as well as two silk-faced leather robes, two pairs of silk trousers, and two long gowns. From Hexin's wife, Zhou (newly married last year), two silk qipaos, a cotton-padded jacket, and one silk-lined jacket and trousers, seven foreign cloth qipaos, and five lined jackets and trousers were taken. Also, one leather robe and one leather vest belonging to the deceased were taken, with a total value of over one thousand yuan.</p>

<p>The deceased had two younger brothers, Chen Xiannian, 32 years old, and Chen Youxian, 28 years old. There was also an elderly mother, Mrs. Yang, 58 years old, four sons, and a daughter-in-law. The eldest son, Hexin, is 19 years old, and the daughter-in-law, Zhou, is 20 years old. The second son, Fuxin, is 13 years old, the third son, Wenxin, is 9 years old, and the fourth son, Rongxin, is 3 years old. There is also a daughter named Yuejin, 6 years old.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 1 PM, after the reporter arrived at the scene and learned of the above situation, Hexin led him to the main room to inspect the wounds of the deceased. Chen Mingxian was lying face up on the boards in the middle of the main room, wearing a white cloth short shirt and white and blue striped cloth pants, barefoot. There was a gunshot wound in the middle of his left chest, above the nipple, and another gunshot wound an inch below his left shoulder. Mrs. Zhang was lying next to the west wall, her abdomen swollen, as if she was about to give birth, wearing a black cloth short shirt, blue cloth pants, and black socks. There was a gunshot wound an inch above her navel, but the bullets did not pass through. The deceased's son, Hexin, has reported the incident to the Dachang Town Public Security Bureau, which has forwarded it to the Baoshan County Government for investigation. According to Hexin, the robbers also instructed him not to make any noise when they left, otherwise they would come back and shoot him. They fired more than ten shots from their rifles along the way as they left.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Cash and Silver Preserved, but Life Not <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Robber Angrily Fires a Shot</p>
<p>Gong Chunshui Dies Loyal to His Employer</p>
<p>Kong Xinyi, a Ningbo native residing at No. 4, Bao'an Fang, Nanyang Bridge, Biel Road, French Concession, is 38 years old and runs a lace export business, setting up the Xinji Lace Shop in his residence. He employs Gong Chunshui (54 years old this year), a native of Nanxiang, as a clerk, with a monthly salary of fourteen yuan, specializing in collecting and distributing lace in the countryside of Changshu. Gong has been in this position for three years and is loyal to his duties, greatly valued by his employer. Gong usually takes the raw materials from Shanghai to the countryside to be made by female workers. When a batch is finished, Gong brings the goods back to Shanghai, settles the wages, and takes the money back to the countryside to pay the workers. This time, Gong brought goods to Shanghai from Changshu before the 20th and stayed at the home of his employer, Kong Xinyi, at No. 4, Bao'an Fang, Biel Road. The night before last, Kong settled the accounts for a total of four hundred yuan and gave the cash to Gong, preparing to go to the countryside yesterday morning. Yesterday morning at 4:30 AM, Gong left Kong's residence, put the money in his pocket, and went out the back door to hire a rickshaw to the North Railway Station to catch the first train to Kunshan and then to Changshu. Unexpectedly, just two or three steps out of the back door, as he was hailing a rickshaw, a robber of medium build, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, a copper basin hat, and rubber overshoes, suddenly emerged from the alley and stopped Gong, trying to rob the money in Gong's pocket. At that moment, Gong grabbed the robber with one hand and pressed down on his pocket with the other, backing away while shouting, "You (referring to the Kong family), come out quickly!" As he struggled with the robber, he backed up to the Kong family's back door. At this time, Xu Hu, a 36-year-old maid from Changshu in the Kong family, had just gotten up and was going outside the back door to wash a chamber pot. She saw Gong grappling with someone and mistakenly thought it was a fight, so she stepped forward to mediate. Gong was then able to break free and flee towards the back door. Just as one foot crossed the threshold of the back door, the robber, hating the maid for interfering and causing him to fail in his purpose, drew a handgun and fired a shot at the woman and Gong. The bullet hit Gong in the right waist, piercing his left waist, and he fell to the ground, blood gushing out. The robber immediately turned and fled without a trace. When the employer, Kong Xinyi, was awakened from his sleep, he got up and went downstairs. He saw Gong lying in the kitchen, unable to speak, bleeding profusely. He quickly hired a car to take Gong to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police to apprehend the robber. Detectives went to the scene of the incident to investigate and recovered a bullet casing, which they took back to the police station for verification. However, Gong's injury was in a vital area, and he died before he could be treated. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for an autopsy, and summoned Gong Xueli (26 years old, working at the Zhabei Second Section Fire Brigade), Gong's son, and the witness Xu Hu to the station. At 10 AM, the police reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Deng Baosun and forensic doctor to the scene to examine the body. The detectives reported the previous situation and presented the stolen money. The deceased's son requested that the robber be apprehended and justice be served. The maid Xu Hu testified about the circumstances of the deceased's struggle with the robber and being shot down. The official ruled that Gong Chunshui's death was indeed caused by a gunshot wound. The body was handed over to the family for burial, and the police department was ordered to apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e160">A Visit to the First Special District Women's Prison Amidst Calls for Prison Reform <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, Who Murdered Her Stepmother, is Skilled in Embroidery</p>
<p>The Female Inmates Are Mostly Between Thirty and Forty Years Old</p>
<p>| Most Cases Involve Opium Offenses |</p>
<p>Since Mr. Dong Shoujing, a prominent figure in the French Concession, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration on behalf of the prisoners in the Caohejing Prison, a movement to improve prison treatment has swept through the city. Besides Caohejing, there are several other prisons within the special districts, but the situation inside them is not well understood by outsiders. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the reporter took a car to the First Special District Women's Prison to inspect the conditions inside. The warden, Sun Xiong, personally received us, and after a pleasant conversation, guided us through the entire facility. We found that all the equipment was well-organized, and the management, education, and sanitation of the prisoners were particularly well done. Warden Sun, whose courtesy name is Yongmou, is from Hunan and is skilled in prison management. Since taking office, he has made great efforts to reorganize the prison, leading to today's achievements. The prison was originally reorganized from the women's detention center of the former Mixed Court. It is now called the Jiangsu Second Prison Branch and is located to the right of the Jiangsu Higher Court Second Branch. The building has four floors. Currently, the first floor houses the warden's office, staff offices, the doctor's office, the education office, and the prisoners' bathroom and laundry room. The remaining eight rooms are used as detention rooms for criminal defendants awaiting trial. The second floor has eight rooms each for the prisoners' infirmary and opium detoxification room. The third and fourth floors are entirely used as prison cells. The cells on the fourth floor are named "Propriety" and "Righteousness," and those on the third floor are named "Integrity" and "Shame." Each section has four rooms, and each room used to hold seven people, so the entire prison could only hold a hundred or so people. In recent years, the number of crimes has increased, and the number of criminals has also increased. Currently, the prison holds more than 400 people, almost three times the designated capacity. The rooms are inevitably crowded. With the arrival of summer, Warden Sun pays great attention to the prisoners' hygiene, requiring the resident doctor to make rounds for examinations every day, and the prison guards work hard to keep the place clean. A special supply department has also been set up, so if a sick prisoner wants food beyond the prescribed menu, it will be provided by the supply department with the prison doctor's permission. Ordinary food is provided three times a day, with two dry meals and one wet meal. The prisoners currently work at sewing clothes, weaving towels, and embroidery. However, there are only two people who are skilled in embroidery, one of whom is Zhang Wenqing, the protagonist of the sensational case of murdering her stepmother that occurred some years ago. In addition to doing manual labor, the prisoners must take courses on elementary literacy and the Three Principles of the People for a certain amount of time each morning, and do freehand exercises for half an hour each afternoon. According to Warden Sun, the female prisoners in the entire prison are mostly between the ages of thirty and forty. Most of the cases involve opium offenses, accounting for about 40%. The remaining cases, such as disturbing public morals and theft, account for about 10% to 15% or 20%. Although the number of prisoners is increasing every day, the food allowance remains the same as the designated quota for one hundred and several dozen people, making it quite difficult to manage the budget.</p>

<p>Shen Bingwen's Refusal to Accept Mediation Was Certainly Wrong</p>
<p>The Policeman on Patrol Who Beat a Man to Death Should be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Shen Bingwen, a 63-year-old man from Jiading who was employed at the Xu Family Garden in Nansheng, District 9, Sanmin Road, Zhenru, has been working for decades and has no family. According to his cohabitant, he had a conflict with a neighboring woman over trivial matters the afternoon before last, and the noise was heard outside. A patrolman from the Third Precinct of the Fourth District happened to pass by and entered to investigate and mediate. Unexpectedly, Shen refused to accept the mediation and responded with abusive language, causing the policeman to become enraged. The policeman then struck Shen's chest with the butt of his pistol, followed by punches and kicks, beating Shen Bingwen to death on the spot. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, the policeman tried to escape, but was detained by the precinct chief, Yao Chongnai, who ordered a patrol officer to guard him. Yesterday, he ordered the local bailiff, Li Yuxiang, to report the death to the District Court for inspection. However, the bailiff confusedly reported that Shen Bingwen had died, had no family, and that was the extent of the report. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin and Coroner Xuan Zhiming were appointed and went to Zhenru for inspection. After hearing reports from the cohabitant and others, the official inspected the deceased's body and found multiple wounds, and the sixth rib had been broken by the beating. It was determined that the death was caused by injuries sustained during his lifetime. An autopsy report was completed, and the body was ordered to be collected. The bailiff was severely reprimanded and ordered to bring witnesses to the court for questioning the next day. The precinct was ordered to send the patrolman to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and punishment. The Third Precinct of the Fourth District has now submitted the patrolman to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Mr. Huang Renzhi's Speech on National Humiliation Week: My Views on the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I received that notice from the YMCA a few days ago, and it really presented me with a difficult problem. Because many gentlemen have spoken about this topic several times already, and this time I am speaking as the last one. You must know that it's not easy to speak last, because almost everything I want to say has already been said by the previous speakers. It just so happens that I am at the rear, which is really my unfortunate fate. Moreover, I just suffered a little loss, because Mr. Wang Yunwu originally wanted to push me to speak first. At that time, I thought I would just be polite for a moment, and if he insisted again, I could take advantage of speaking first. Unexpectedly, he didn't decline any further. So everything I wanted to say was already said by him. That's really a big loss.</p>
<p>However, this topic is about my views, and not your views or his views. Thinking about it, my views must be my personal opinions, different from other people's opinions. Now, I'll first divide it into two sides, as the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy." First, let's look at the Japanese side. I didn't pay much attention to it before. Although I have been in social service for thirty years and have been to Japan four times, I only inspected education and didn't really look at its politics, economy, and other aspects. Until the spring of the year before last, when I went to Japan, I unexpectedly received a great shock. Because I suddenly saw that the general situation was one of high spirits and great excitement. The people were all talking about how to attack the Soviet Union, how to attack the United States, and how to first plunder our Northeast and conquer China. It really seemed like a surging tide. However, when I heard it at that time, I just thought they were saying it like our Chinese people shouting about "Down with Imperialism." So I didn't pay much attention to it. Before the September 18th Incident, I wrote a book called "A Voyage Around the Yellow Sea." Who would have thought that we had just forgotten about it, and soon the September 18th Incident happened. At that time, I deeply blamed myself for being useless and rebuked myself for being muddleheaded. Since I knew the above situation in Japan, I should have returned and used twenty-four percent sincerity, or even tearfully pleaded with the authorities, urging everyone to pay attention. I shouldn't have regarded it as just empty talk. But I didn't expect that such a great disaster would befall us. Since the September 18th Incident, there was the January 28th Incident that Mr. Wang Yunwu just talked about. Not long after, it continued. And it wasn't just the January 28th Incident, there was also Shanhaiguan, Nantianmen, Rehe, Luanhe, and so on. So their words were definitely not empty talk, but really something they did.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about Japan for now. Let's talk about China. But some people ask me, saying what will China be like in the future? I reply to them, "Whatever you want it to be, it will be." This is not a joke. I can give a few examples. The September 18th Incident, although it was Japan's premeditated plan, was also because Zhang Xueliang and a group of Northeast officials wanted it to be that way. It wasn't just that Zhang Xueliang and others' non-resistance was what they wanted, but also that the people of the three northeastern provinces wanted it to be that way. Let's talk about Rehe. I have been to Rehe, but it hadn't been lost when I went. Not long after I returned, Rehe was lost. But do you all know how Rehe was lost? It wasn't because Japanese soldiers came and drove Tang Yulin away. We know that Tang Yulin was the chairman of Rehe. He usually not only didn't pay attention to the people's livelihood and suffering, but also exploited the people, forcing them to grow opium and openly manufacturing morphine. This made the people suffer unspeakably. Even when the enemy came, they were unwilling to cooperate with Tang Yulin. So the Japanese army was able to seize Rehe so effortlessly because Tang Yulin didn't want Rehe. If he loved Rehe, he wouldn't have engaged in such rampant extortion. There were also several generals such as Zhang Zuoxiang who were initially unwilling to go, and only went when the crisis was imminent. Of course, it was too late. In fact, it was because everyone didn't want Rehe, so Rehe was given away for others to take. All of the above past facts show that whatever you want it to be, it will be. So predicting the future, it will also be whatever you want it to be. But my hope is that it won't be anything.</p>
<p>What I want to contribute today is that there are several mentalities that must not be had. If you have these mentalities, it will definitely be whatever you don't want it to be. I have a friend whose son is studying at school. One day, he went back to see his father and said to his father, "There's no hope for China. It's better to let it perish." His father blamed him for saying such a thing, but he retorted, "Dad, you don't know. Most people in China don't have any patriotism." His father said, "You can't say that. Even if everyone is a bad person, you should still be a good person." This is a very good point. Therefore, everyone should encourage themselves and never be discouraged just because there's no hope. There are also people who say that the Chinese people haven't suffered enough. They should suffer more, and only then will there be a way out after the country is destroyed. This person's argument is certainly more insightful than my friend's son. Perhaps he has read a lot of history and seen that when the Yuan Dynasty invaded China, the Yuan Dynasty was assimilated. When the Qing Dynasty entered the pass, it was also assimilated. Our China is still China. However, we know that this is history and shouldn't compare it to the present. We must remember that in 1919, the Korean people took the opportunity of the Paris Peace Conference to seek independence. Their national spirit is truly admirable. Since the demonstration on March 2nd, the Japanese authorities' treatment of the Korean people has been one of massacre, capture, and all kinds of extremes. In one village, where there were more patriotic elements, they were even surrounded by troops and massacred. As a result, in March, they killed more than 30,000 men and more than 2,000 women, and imprisoned more than 10,000. Despite such great sacrifices, independence was still not achieved. It can be seen that it is impossible to save a country after it has been destroyed. So if China wants to preserve this country, it must do so before the country is destroyed.</p>
<p>At the end of January this year, I went to the north and saw that Zhang Xueliang's measures were not good. Therefore, I came back and said to President Song Dai that the situation in the north is getting more and more dangerous. If the government wants this North China, it should quickly save the situation. If you have already read the evening paper today, you should know that the Japanese army has already crossed the Luan River. So if China doesn't save it now, it won't be able to save it. Now, banditry is rampant in the Yangtze River basin, disputes have occurred in Xinjiang, and Sichuan is about to have a civil war again. If this continues, China will have no place to hang this old sign. We, the people, should quickly rise up. This sign hasn't been broken yet, so we should quickly protect the sign.</p>
<p>Now, I have a few more words to offer to you all. First, we must strengthen our physique, just as Mr. Wang Yunwu said. In Germany, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone pays attention to physical fitness. Although I haven't been to Germany, I know that every household in Germany has a radio and listens to slogans and exercises every morning. We also have radios in China, but everyone just listens to ditties. The listeners here today are all outstanding people. If you go outside and see the decadent and dissolute lifestyle, it's really degenerate beyond imagination. Second, as I often say, we need science. Let's think about why we are being "tricked." It's because we don't have science. We should all work hard in the future. For example, we should teach children to study science as soon as they have knowledge. Now, I have to be rude and make a gentleman an example. Who is it? It's Mr. Wang Yunwu. He is the general manager of the Commercial Press, invented the Four-Corner Method of Character Indexing, compiled dictionaries, and can speak several languages. He is also a scientist. He studied engineering at a foreign correspondence school and obtained an engineer's diploma. After the January 28th Incident, he buried himself in hard work and managed to revive the Commercial Press in a short period of time. If the government officials could bury themselves in work like Mr. Wang, the country's situation would at least not be so bad. (End)</p>

<p>Huang Feilong Sets New 200-Meter Meet Record of 23.6 Seconds</p>
<p>The Guanghua Affiliated Middle School track and field team, after winning the city middle school athletic meet championship, yesterday won the China School Sports Federation field event and track event championships. They scored twenty points in field events and thirty-seven points in track events. Yesterday morning it was drizzling, but fortunately it cleared up in the afternoon. However, because the field was saturated with water, the competition was inconvenient. The results were still good. Huang Feilong showed his power in the 100-meter and 200-meter races. He completed the 200-meter race in just 23.6 seconds, breaking his own meet record of 23.8 seconds, which was the most outstanding achievement of this meet. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e185">Good Sprint Results <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>▲100 meters The competition was extremely fierce. Huang Feilong, Li Songnian, Dong Yinchu, and Liu Jiayou can be called the four outstanding individuals in this event. Each of them has very even strength. Dong Yinchu, who was first in the semi-finals, fell to third place. Huang Feilong won the championship, taking only 11.6 seconds, which is quite impressive.</p>
<p>▲200 meters The competition for this event was as fierce as the 100-meter race. At the finish line, they were in a horizontal line, sprinting to the finish line. Jinan's Huang Feilong won the championship again, taking only 23.4 seconds, breaking his own meet record of 23.8 seconds. Guanghua's Dong Yinchu was second, Minli's Liu Jiayou was third, and Fuzhong's Cheng Zhiyuan was fourth.</p>

<p>▲Field Events After winning the city middle school championship, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School's spirit was even more excited. However, the situation this time was quite even. In the seven events, Guanghua only won one first place, the shot put. With their even talent, they finally won the championship with twenty points. Jinan and Shanghai Middle School each won two first places. Shanghai Middle School was the runner-up with seventeen points, and Jinan was third with eleven points.</p>
<p>▲Track Events Guanghua's talent is the most abundant. They won a total of five first places, ranking first with thirty-seven points. Second place, Jinan Affiliated Middle School, only had fifteen points. Fudan Affiliated Middle School was one point behind in third place.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Miscellaneous Notes from the Venue <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The heavens were exceptionally kind, forcing out bursts of strong smiles. The athletic field was adorned with many sporty young ladies and gentlemen. The surrounding stands also had more sports enthusiasts than the previous days. Among them were various cheerleading squads, beautiful girls, and young men.</p>
<p>▲ Desperately Playing the Jinghu</p>
<p>On the north side of the stage, a young man in a long gown, for reasons unknown, sat with his legs crossed, desperately playing the "Four-Skin Dao Ban" on his Jinghu, singing along to himself, thoroughly enjoying himself. It drew laughter from the surrounding spectators. It was truly inexplicable that he was pulling on the Jinghu.</p>
<p>▲ Kang Tong Loves Pictures</p>
<p>The Kang family's daughters are all heroes. Look at the three sisters joining the competition together, and each one receiving a shiny medal. Moreover, during one of Kang Tong's jumps, I discovered her little secret: she loves small pictures. She spied the "Five Flowers" playing cards in her sister's hand and quickly hid them in her pocket, giving them a smile at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Shouts from the Adjacent Field</p>
<p>Because the heavens were unkind, the audience in our field was sparse. However, the neighboring baseball field was filled with veterans like us making a scene, which attracted countless curious fans. It suddenly became lively. Whenever a veteran fell, there was a chorus of shouts, deafening and tantalizing.</p>
<p>▲ A Bouquet of Beautiful Flowers</p>
<p>In these times, everything is tight. Therefore, this event was not as glamorous as the Middle School Joint Association's. Only a small thatched pavilion served as the command center, and a temporary small stage served as the awards platform. The prizes were only three flags and sixty-three small medals. However, a bouquet of beautiful fresh flowers added an immeasurable amount of splendor. Unfortunately, the flowers did not end up in the hands of the athletes, but instead ended up in front of the chest of the awards presenter, Ms. Zhang Wanqing.</p>
<p>▲ Guanghua's Solo Act</p>
<p>This time, several relay races were canceled because there were no scores, so nobody wanted to run. Fortunately, the Guanghua Girls' Team performed a 200-meter race alone, otherwise, it would have been too embarrassing.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Shen Bao and Current Affairs Tie in a Heated Match <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Each side wins one half, nothing to say.</p>
<p>Shi Bao beats Min Bao by two goals, content and satisfied.</p>
<p>Chen Bao beats Xin Wen by one, overjoyed.</p>
<p>▲ Three Matches Today, Starting at 3:30 PM at the Municipal Stadium</p>
<p>▲ (1) Shen Bao vs. Chen Bao (2) Shi Bao vs. Current Affairs (3) Min Bao vs. Xin Wen</p>
<p>The weather was oppressive, with lingering rain and damp ground overgrown with grass, making walking difficult. After 3:00 PM, the editorial departments of various newspapers, six teams of veterans, gradually arrived at the YMCA to gather. Because the Military Affairs Committee had issued a declaration and the Premier dared not revive old ways, the Garrison Commander simultaneously ordered the lifting of martial law. Therefore, all the athletes arrived on time. The three major battles were confusing, lacking the "intense," "enjoyable," and "thorough" experiences never seen before, no wonder the four Kang family fans are always laughing. Director Pan Gongzhan also brought his young son to watch the game, and couldn't help but smile at the exciting moments. Shen Bao's manager, Ma Yinliang, personally led a cheering squad to support and encourage the team, becoming very excited. Xin Wen Bao, Shi Chen Shi Shi Min, and other newspapers had many backstage bosses lurking around, shouting and cheering support at any time, making for a lively and exciting scene. Starting at 3:30 PM this afternoon, the six armies will rush to the public stadium and engage in another major battle.</p>

<p>Shi Bao Defeats Min Bao: Two to Zero</p>
<p>▲ Old Teng Turns into a Spotted Leopard</p>
<p>When Shen Huichun blew his whistle, the two Chens of Shi and Min faced each other, saying nothing. Teng Shugu passed the ball to Ren Naijing, who attacked northward. Chen Jingzhao could not block them. Lu Guangjie started from the edge and flew into the penalty area. Wu Zhongyi gritted his teeth and rushed out diagonally. Teng Shugu had outstanding martial skills and fell head over heels, dizzy and disoriented. His snow-white pants were covered in mud. He looked like a leopard from the Nan Mountain.</p>
<p>▲ Twelve-Yard Penalty Can Be Changed to Four Yards</p>
<p>But with unyielding ambition, they charged several times. Jiang Hongjiao hurriedly instructed the rear guards to strengthen their defense. Teng Wengong could not reach the State of Chu, but could only pant like a cow, sighing with emotion, "Heroes have short tempers, what can I do?" Before long, the Min Bao defender committed a twelve-yard penalty. Wang Mengnian acted as the executioner, but unexpectedly, the ball did not move, and Wang fell to the ground first. In total, the ball was about four yards away from his foot. He still angrily said to others, "If it were a four-yard penalty, I would definitely score," Those who heard this couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>▲ Shi Bao Joyfully Gives Birth to Twins</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Shi and Min Bao's defense was in constant danger. Wu Zhongyi wielded his broadsword, killing like a demon. Hu Liangcheng even desperately ate pufferfish, falling twice in a row. Before long, Old Teng carried the ball deep, but Chen Jingzhao slipped, face-planting in the mud. Wu and Hu were outside and hadn't returned. Gao Xueguo broke out in a cold sweat, abandoning the empty goal and rushing to intercept. Just then, Old Teng had arrived. Then quickly, he fell in a double tumble. Jiang Zongdao, like a fisherman, reaped the benefits, arriving in time and kicking the ball into the net. After restarting the game, the Min Bao team was furious and launched a massive counterattack. Jiang Jianjiao constantly stirred up trouble on the east side. Li Gengxi and Cheng Changbin closed their doors, and Lei Bifeng guarded both left and right. Jiang Zongdao and Lu Guanshu supported the three southern expeditions. Old Teng was brave and skillful, venturing deep into no-man's-land. With a resounding kick, Gao Xuepu touched the ball, but it had already entered the net. He could only stare blankly, lamenting his misfortune.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Bao Defeats Xin Wen: One to Zero</p>
<p>The Chen Bao-Xin Wen match started after Shi and Min Bao. Chen Bao's goalkeeper, Hu Zongfan, had not recovered from his leg injury. He was forcibly dragged onto the field, somewhat embarrassed. He had to bear the pain, learning to be like a camel.</p>
<p>▲ Xin Wen Bao Misses a Good Opportunity</p>
<p>Amidst the sound of drums and horns, Chen Bao's Jin Xi passed the ball north. Pei Shunyuan roared, scaring the enemy back three hundred miles. The veteran Qu Yue released his horse in the eastern suburbs, with impressive momentum. Zhou Fuming remotely supported the short, fat Zi. Ma Zhishan was not good at skating, falling in a chaotic mess, even more willing to yield for the country, not kicking the ball when he saw it. This annoyed the twin-gun Lu Wenlong (Yi) and the grass-flying Shen Meizhen, who coordinated their advance. Yu Deyuan regretted being careless inside the penalty area, resulting in a twelve-yard penalty. Chen Tongsong had no strength in his foot, and the ball flew over the crossbar.</p>
<p>▲ Shen Meizhen's Heart is Brave Beyond Ten Thousand</p>
<p>Chen Bao's colleagues all clapped their hands, celebrating together towards the sky. Wang Zunwu shook his spirits. Yao Suifeng even covered her head with a white towel, looking fiercely. She peered in twice. Yu Kongwo held up his demon-revealing mirror, and the ball had nowhere to hide. Shen Meizhen glared like a bull, charging and pressing forward repeatedly. Chen Bao's defense feared her like a tiger. Yao Suifeng spread a net of iron wire, and Xu Ze spread more lime bottles. No matter how brave you are, there is no room for discussion. Wang Dexin drilled through the cracks, but suddenly rushed into Xin Wen Bao's forbidden area, facing the goal and working together. Jiang Jianhou remained calm and welcomed him with his foot. Jiang Zonghuai commanded the three armies, breathing heavily as he entered Chen Bao's territory. Shen Meizhen drew his bow and nocked an arrow, but Hu Zongfan dived to save it.</p>
<p>▲ Qu Yue's Kick Decides the Game</p>
<p>Ma Zhishan worked hard, not only often pulling a rickshaw, but also being able to kick the ball out of bounds. After much commotion, the break arrived. After switching sides and fighting again, Old Ma came to the field, acting as an inspector, reducing the number of jokes. You came and I went, with opposing edges, without a victor. For nearly ten minutes, Chen Bao's front-line generals pressed extremely hard. Zhou Jicheng could not resist with two fists. Qu Yue spotted an opening, and with a kick, the ball flew like an arrow. Jiang Jianhou was caught off guard, and the score was opened. Although Xin Wen Bao worked hard to counterattack afterwards, time did not allow it. The game ended.</p>
<p>▲ Shen Bao and Current Affairs: One to One</p>
<p>The warm sun shone all over the baseball field. Three thousand faces with different emotions. A moment of laughter, a moment of noise. Mrs. Jiang Huaiqing frowned and said "It's slippery." It turned out that Huaiqing was in charge of goalkeeping, so it was really "slippery."</p>
<p>▲ Current Affairs' New Three Barefoot</p>
<p>Before there was Ma Hua's defender Yu Zhuohua repelling enemies barefoot, after there was Little Sister Mei Hong imitating, brave is brave, but still not as good as today's Current Affairs New Three Musketeers. Although the former was barefoot, they still had socks. Today's players are completely naked, without any pretense. Commander Jiang Xiangqing first revealed his nine-foot round skin, with momentum like a galloping horse. Xia Kaiming also rose to imitate. Li Zhuozhen learned from the threshold, taking consistent action with Old Jiang. Therefore, fans said, "It's like transplanting rice seedlings and like fishing," But they are still really playing soccer. Truly being barefoot takes a lot of advantage. The sole of the foot faces down, it is a special pair of shoes that ensures they won't fall. Therefore, Old Jiang runs particularly fast.</p>
<p>▲ Nie Shiqi Scores First</p>
<p>After a long time of close combat and hand-to-hand fighting, the two sides rebuilt their defenses. The Current Affairs new front line, under the command of Old Jiang, coordinated extremely well. Shen Bao's central defense had the general Xie Hong, who was good at using all eighteen weapons and was exceptionally brave. The third line of defense, Li Zunyong, blocked east and west, impenetrable. The ball lingered for a long time in the center line. Jiang Xiangqing dribbled south, breaking through three passes in a row, and at a suitable spot, passed the ball to Nie Shiqi, who advanced a few steps and shot powerfully into the goal. Shen Bao was defeated by 1 to 0 in the first half.</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Mingxin Returns the Favor</p>
<p>Shen Bao's center forward, Sun Daosheng, was a veteran on the field. How could he willingly be inferior and not think of resisting? In the second half, he encouraged the front-line generals to burn their boats and fight to the death. Xie Hong transported his wheels busily. The Current Affairs new defense roared like men and horses, shouting and killing. Jiang Xiangqing entertained his guests thoughtfully, either shaking hands with them or kicking them, without any mishaps for five minutes. But as the saying goes, "Things don't happen more than three times." Not long after Sun Daosheng raised the flag of righteousness, and ten thousand people followed his example. Lu Erqiang ferried the ball on his feet, and Zhu Mingxin found an opportunity to strike, hitting the key point. Although Current Affairs refused to compromise, the environment forced them to finally sign the agreement.</p>

<p>Heaven was not fair, raining for a day or two, turning the baseball field into a vast little sea. But the six-newspaper veterans, wanting to wash away the shame of being weak scholars, decided to brave the wind and rain and meet on schedule. Our newspaper's battle with Shi Shi Xin Bao was scheduled for the third game. We saw many people from all walks of life come to the baseball field, occupying the four stands, clapping and stamping their feet, finally having a good time. But the six teams of veterans suffered, falling dizzy and disoriented, and everyone laughed heartily. Thinking about it, there must be a reason for this, and I will slowly explain it.</p>
<p>Our team was complete. Chairman Zhang Yunhe, Advisors Ma Yinliang, Zhang Shutong, Wu Tingchen, and others, as well as Committee Members Qu Shao Yi, Ma Chugan, Zhao Junhao, and Hu Zhongchi, gave the order to set out the entire division. Committee members Qu and Zhao also brought refreshments to quench their thirst. Upon arriving at the battlefield, they changed clothes in the YMCA office. Secretaries Jiang Huaiqing, Tang Shichang, and Ji Zhizhong rushed around taking care of things. At 5:15, after the Xin-Chen battle ended, our team members prepared to enter the field. Friends from all directions cheered loudly, shaking the mountains. The ground grew green grass, which was indeed lush and green, but after being rained on by the heavens for a few days, it accumulated water and didn't flow, turning into a waterfall country. When the ball landed, the water splashed everywhere, like the January 28th bombs in Zhabei. You grabbed and I stole, and in the end, everyone measured the land. The snow-white pants changed color, and the soccer shoes were covered in mud, becoming one. We couldn't tell each other apart. With every step, mud followed the ball, splashing into the opponent's eyes, making it difficult to open them. Although it was not like drowned chickens, they turned into mud-plated Wuxi Afu. Inside the entire field, all twenty-two people became mud statues. Li Jun Zun was especially coated into a model, and when he got up, his face turned into a dragon and became a scholar of the Pavilion of Literature. Forty-four hands temporarily served as plasterers, slipping east and west, like ice skating on the North Sea.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Two Rivers Women's Physical Education Teachers' College Group Sports Meet Today <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The 14th Spring Sports Meet of the Two Rivers Women's Physical Education Teachers' College, originally scheduled for the 18th as a track and field meet, saw the entire school's students participate, making the competition extremely intense and the spirit exceptionally high. The results of the 50-meter, 100-meter, and long jump were quite impressive. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the competition, a heavy rain suddenly poured down, causing the meet to end prematurely. The unfinished events will be held within the next week. The group sports meet is scheduled to be held today at 2:00 PM at the Chinese Baseball Field on Laborie Road in the French Concession. In addition to the entire school's students participating, graduates from various schools in the city, such as Minli Women's Middle School, Minzhi Women's Middle School, Chengdong Women's Middle School, Renhe Women's School, Xuhui Sixth Elementary School, and Xiaoming School, will be present to perform. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters will also attend the opening ceremony as a whole. There will also be a dazzling special publication issued. If it rains, it will be postponed to Sunday of the following week.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Philosophy of Dice <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Dice are rumored to be the creation of Cao Zijian, who could compose poetry in seven steps. If this is true, dice are a product of the third century, roughly 1,700 years ago. Later, in the Tang Dynasty, manufacturing became more sophisticated, with bone carved into holes and painted with vermillion and ink. There were also clever designs with hidden patterns, such as embedding red beans into the holes, chosen for their bright and easily visible color. As Wen Tingyun's alluring poem goes: "In the exquisite dice are red beans set, does anyone know the longing in human bones?"</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned history of dice, although it cannot be definitively determined that Cao Zijian invented dice, it can be asserted that it was a Chinese invention, not a Western one. However, there is still a question. I read Dai Hongci's "Travels in Nine Countries," where he visited the museum in Denmark and saw ancient artifacts dating back thousands of years. The most peculiar of these were stone dice, with dots representing the numbers one through six, arranged in the same manner as in China. Upon seeing this, Dai suspected that these were Chinese artifacts that had spread to this region. However, the museum director, Blinkenberg, vehemently denied this. If he vehemently denied it, then the invention of dice in China and the West was purely coincidental.</p>
<p>The numbers and arrangement of dice are quite consistent with philosophy, especially with Einstein's theory of relativity. The opposite of the greatest prosperity is the greatest decline; therefore, the opposite of six is one. Without reaching the peak of prosperity, the opposite will not be the depths of decline; therefore, the opposite of five is two. Being only slightly more prosperous, the opposite will also be only slightly more declined; therefore, the opposite of four is three.</p>
<p>The greedy gambler, after rolling the dice several times, wants the numbers to be even higher. Rolling a total of six is not enough; rolling a six and a five is not enough. He must roll a full six of everything. Alas! Reaching the peak is also reaching the depths of decline. Who knows, when it turns over, what the actual total number will be?</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Pawnbroker's Face <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The poor, working-class friends often visit the pawnshop behind the poor man's door many times each month. And they all say in unison: "The pawnbroker's face is really hard to look at!" In fact, the pawnbroker is also a person with ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. They are by no means hideous and terrifying. But poor friends tell me: "Their faces are always iron-clad; their words are always decisive. Don't you think that's hard to look at? No shop, no business, ever has this kind of air. In business, they can be called a special zone."</p>
<p>Actually, the faces of Shanghai's pawnbrokers are still somewhat pleasing. Because on any road, there's a pawnshop every five steps, an appraisal every ten steps, the backdoor to convenience of the poor is full of openings. If you don't succeed with one owner, you can go to another, so pawnbrokers, for the sake of business, never make things too difficult for the poor. But it's not the same inland! Often, in a city or a town, there's only one or two. They've got you by the horns, where can you run to? So the pawnbroker's pretense is even easier to put on. They open at nine in the morning and close at four in the afternoon, just like a bank. Some inexperienced poor friends who try to pawn or redeem during their lunch break are in for bad luck. You're told to wait patiently, because they won't put down their rice bowls, and even if they're done eating, they'll wash their faces and smoke before starting to turn the pages. If a clueless friend were to rush them, they'd only get cursed at.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, some things aren't surprising. Whenever you seek something from someone, you must lower your head and humble yourself. Although a pawnshop isn't a charitable organization, it's still a creditor, and you always have to ask them for money. So, it's natural that they have a hard face to look at. In fact, there are many people in the world with faces like pawnbrokers! Friends in difficulty always say that they will share blessings and hardships. But when one of them prospers while the other still struggles, then the prospering friend will also put on a pawnbroker-like face. When you get a lover, gold and silver flow away like water, and of course you're exceptionally affectionate. But when the money runs out and you're left empty-handed, then the sweet face will also turn into a pawnbroker-like face. Besides, there are many things like this!</p>
<p>"Having to pass under their eaves, how can one not bow one's head?" Poor friends! Don't complain about the pawnbroker's hard face to look at, if you weren't poor, how would you ever see that awkward face?</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Grand Funeral <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>When a person stretches out their legs and passes away, according to universal law, if the deceased made contributions to the world during their lifetime, we naturally mourn them or build some memorial to serve as an example for future generations. Otherwise, if the deceased was just an ordinary person, their death would be no different from the death of a cat or dog, unworthy of attention.</p>
<p>Those squatting on the boat of society, especially the rich merchants, big businessmen, officials, politicians, and misers, once they die, their descendants should, in theory, take out some of their wealth to do some public welfare for the society in order to leave a lasting memorial. However, the Chinese are extremely selfish. Society is society, and private affairs are private affairs. Public affairs are irrelevant to them!</p>
<p>Vanity shrouds the heads of all mankind. The so-called filial sons and virtuous grandchildren in our country are well aware that the wealth left by their ancestors was not used for society during their lifetime, and their descendants will certainly keep it for themselves to enjoy.</p>
<p>However, when their parents die, in order to praise the deceased's reputation and exaggerate their own filial piety, the most glorious and moving thing in their consciousness is a grand funeral. Among the decorations of the dead turning under the wheels of the city, a grand funeral is an extremely common, extremely ordinary, and extremely expensive thing.</p>
<p>Putting out rows of funerary objects, paper effigies, ceremonial attendants, and everything else stretching for several miles, spending thousands or even tens of thousands, the descendants are always happy and sincere, because this kind of approach can attract the attention of the crowd and the public's sight and sound. This kind of unconscious behavior, which the humans clinging to the Earth's crust engage in, only the Chinese are willing to do foolishly and stubbornly. A grand funeral is indeed a manifestation of a morbid mentality in Chinese society.</p>
<h3 id="e209">National Soul! <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>"What exactly is a human being? Please answer me!" This was what a solemn old pastor asked me. Originally, I was just a basic scholar who, due to my weak constitution and frequent illnesses, enjoyed perusing Buddhist and Taoist texts to study methods of nourishing my body. Later, through a friend's introduction, I came to know several Christians who fervently praised the gifts of their "Holy Spirit" and "God" to me. As I wanted to learn some Christian doctrines, I consulted that old pastor, but who knew that the old pastor would start by asking me this question.</p>
<p>I replied to the old pastor, "Taoism speaks of 'nature' and 'life'; nature is the spirit, and life is the physical body. Guiding and ingesting elixirs is to temper the physical body, while quiet sitting and breathing exercises are to cultivate the spirit. Therefore, a person is composed of these two things, 'nature' and 'life', and to increase longevity, one must focus on these two words. Buddhism says that a person is composed of the soul and the physical body, the physical body being a temporary combination of the four great elements: 'earth,' 'water,' 'wind,' and 'fire.' Therefore, all four elements are empty, and this stinking carcass will soon turn to nothing. Only the soul is immortal; the four births and six paths are clear evidence of the soul. I believe in both Buddhist and Taoist teachings. I think: a person's physical body is of course composed of carbon, iron, phosphorus, and organic compounds; the cells of our physical body are like millions of batteries; isn't the soul like an electron? A person is formed by combining various elements and electrons."</p>
<p>The old pastor smiled and said, "That is not so; a person is composed of three things: 'spirit,' 'soul,' and 'body.' God sculpted man from clay and breathed into him a soul, and the spirit is the last thing given. Only when this person turns to God, receives baptism, and vows to be a good person does God grant the 'spirit'!" After hearing the old pastor's words, I suddenly understood. Look at our fellow countrymen, in these days of "national peril," with the Northeast lost and the beacon fires of North China raging, yet the decadent atmosphere of the Southern Dynasties persists, with people indulging in sensual pleasures, their souls drifting away. They are reveling in lust and their souls are not attached to their bodies. Could this situation be the "national soul" of our Republic of China! Now, Tianjin and Beijing are in imminent danger, and North China is on the verge of collapse, which is to be expected. But must we wait for the desolate nights of autumn before the ghosts of the wronged and forsaken appear in our Jiangnan? God! Quickly grant the "spirit" to the Chinese people! Amen.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Words Sever Affection, Doors Shut in Tearful Grief; Bearing Responsibility, Wine Shared in Discussion</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Ji Zhi's whereabouts changed greatly, and he was not seen returning until five o'clock. The days were short in winter. By five o'clock, the sky was already pitch black. Even if the old maid had the determination to wait quietly, time would not permit it. So he returned despondently for two consecutive days. After ten days, he became somewhat impatient. When a maid from the Gan family came out to buy things, the two encountered each other, and he smiled: "Aunt Wang, you did a lot for me last year. I didn't even give you any money to spend during the New Year, I'm really sorry." As he spoke, he took out two small bills from his pocket and stuffed them into Aunt Wang's hand, smiling: "I don't have anything to give you, don't mind the small amount, take it and buy a packet of tea to drink." Aunt Wang unexpectedly received several bills from him and didn't know what he meant, but it's always a good thing when people give money, so she greeted Gui Zhi and thanked her repeatedly. Gui Zhi smiled: "You have so many people in your family, up and down, just you alone, it's really hard for you!" Aunt Wang said: "I'm used to it, it's nothing, I'm very comfortable." Gui Zhi said: "Is your master often at home?" Aunt Wang said: "The master is always away for most of the day." Gui Zhi pretended to be very natural, without any hesitation, and asked Aunt Wang: "What about your second master? Is he also away for most of the day?" When Aunt Wang heard him mention the second master, she looked at his face and smiled, the crow's feet under her eyes creasing into many layers. She smiled: "Miss, let me say a few words to you, but don't be angry." When Gui Zhi heard these words, her heart skipped a beat. However, his attitude remained very calm. He smiled: "Why would I be angry about your second master's affairs?" Aunt Wang, seeing that he didn't mind, told him in detail how the master came back and discussed with the madam, how the madam advised the master after the discussion, how the master told the madam to scare the second master, and how the second master admitted his mistake and wanted to break off contact with the old maid. Gui Zhi's face turned red and then pale when she heard these words, but she smiled: "It's your master and madam who are overthinking things. I'm just a young woman, why would I have any dealings with the masters?" This is just a one-time thing, don't tell anyone else about it in the future. (76)</p>

<h3 id="e211">Children's Toys <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Gentlemen, today I have some very important words to say. These words come from famous child psychologists who have gained them through experiments in kindergartens. Therefore, parents must pay attention to the nature of their children and try to remedy any deficiencies in their home education. For example, with children's toys, we think of them as ordinary things, and we simply spend money to buy them for them to play with, regardless of whether they are good or bad, not knowing which kind of toy is suitable for which kind of child's nature. However, children in their early childhood, especially when their knowledge is gradually opening up, it is best to pay attention to their nature. If we understand their nature and slowly cultivate and influence them, then we can gradually reform their original bad qualities and remedy their shortcomings. Now, I will briefly explain what kind of toys should be given to children of different natures:</p>
<p>(1) For children who are nervous, they should be given gardening tools, sprinklers, wooden horses, balls, trumpets, drums, electric trains, and other toys.</p>
<p>(2) For children who are restless, they should be given picture albums, origami, paper cutting, string games, tangrams, and other toys.</p>
<p>(3) For children who lack independence, they should be given clay crafts, puzzle games, string games, and other toys.</p>
<p>(4) For children who lack patience, they should be given bean crafts, gardening tools, puzzle games, fishing gear, drawing templates, and other toys.</p>
<p>(5) For children who lack perseverance, they should be given sewing tools, kitchen tools, clay crafts, drawing templates, and other toys.</p>
<p>(6) For children who are timid, they should be given wooden horses, swings, stilts, bicycles, high jumps, long jumps, and other games.</p>
<p>(7) For children who are cruel, they should be given animal toys, insects, birds and beasts, fresh flowers, statues of gods and Buddhas, and other toys.</p>
<p>(8) For children who don't like to make friends, they should be given magic lanterns, spinning wheel games, Arhat idols, and other toys that involve groups.</p>
<p>(9) For children who are cunning and deceitful, they should be given toys of kind and compassionate idols of gods and Buddhas.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a village in Italy, there was an eyeglass shop. The shop's apprentice often played with convex and concave lenses, and he found it very interesting. Sometimes he would hold a convex lens in each hand and look through them carefully, and he seemed to see things outside more closely than when he looked through just one lens. After the apprentice discovered this, he called the other apprentices in the shop to come and see. Sure enough, it was true. At this time, even the neighbors came to watch. A famous scholar named Galileo happened to be passing by when they were making a fuss. He didn't know why they were gathered together, snatching things to look at, so he also grabbed one to take a look and said, "What's so special about your convex lenses? Can I borrow them to take a look?" The apprentice, with a smug smile on his face, gave them to him. Sure enough, when he used both hands to move the convex lenses back and forth to look carefully, he could see things far away when the distance between the two lenses was far apart, and as he gradually moved them closer, he could see things closer. Therefore, after Galileo returned home, he focused on studying the principles behind it. As a result, he put the convex lens in a tube, made it telescopic, and invented the telescope.</p>

Is the clock at home fast or slow compared to the clock at the post office?</p>
<p>(Answer) He didn't delay at the post office and immediately returned by the same route, and he didn't run any faster or slower than when he went. It can be seen that the clock at home is five minutes fast.</p>

However, because Mai Jia Li ate September US dollars 9375, it was still able to support it. When no one wanted to close September US dollars 25, Wu sold again and again. Da Xing Yong worked hard to sell in the market, and it broke the 70 yuan mark, plunging to 66.5 yuan. Goods advanced to 8 yuan. However, Da Xing Yong's selling intention was extremely strong, and Yuan Mao Yong and Yuan Chun successively sold off.

<p>The financial business this year has not been very active, mainly due to the inconvenience in procedures after the abandonment of silver, coupled with the sluggish commercial activity, making loans difficult. Furthermore, the rural economy has had poor harvests, such as the silk and tea industries, which are completely inferior to last year, resulting in a significant decrease in the need for funds. The market is quiet. Yesterday was also Saturday, and as usual, there were no major transactions to record. The market for foreign exchange was slightly lower than the previous day, calculated as seven cents. The early market was uniform, and the water cut was still weak, only doing one jiao three or four fen.

<h3 id="e218">Copper Coins Continuously Contract in Recent Days <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 850 yuan in the early market and 845 yuan in the afternoon market, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day, the situation was very weak, because there were few transactions, the purpose was not widespread, so few people paid attention, the transaction was only 4000 jiao in the early market. Guangdong small silver dollars were still 779.7 yuan in the early market, the same as the previous day. In the afternoon market, it suddenly rose by 1.1 yuan, calculated as 780.08 yuan. The transaction was 95,000 jiao in the early market and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>Securities: Delivery Approaches</p>
<h3 id="e219">Government Bonds Trend is Extremely Abnormal <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was relatively flat and tired. Tianjin and Beijing are in imminent danger, and it has reached a critical juncture. Riots have occurred in Tianjin, and it has entered a period of terror. Enemy planes have appeared repeatedly in Beiping, and the safety of the overall situation is at stake. It has reached a life-or-death moment. The market's popularity cannot help but be slightly panicked. However, because delivery is approaching, speculators have many concerns, so although market prices are slightly weak, there has not been a significant decline. This is a situation created by mutual restraint. For example, in the first session of the morning, it fell by about three or four jiao, while the salt tax for this month rose by as much as five jiao due to the result of scarce sales of No. 46. The far-term salt tax did not rise or fall at all. In the second session, demobilization rose sharply by six jiao, while the salt tax for this month alone fell by four jiao. The trend is extremely abnormal, mostly due to the relationship between long and short swaps, and it can also be seen that people's minds are in a trance. The afternoon opening saw few transactions. Except for the unified tax, which was slightly smaller by two or three jiao, the rest rose slightly by two or three jiao. At the close, due to the riots in Tianjin, people's minds were more nervous, and they unanimously returned by three to five jiao. The result for the whole day was a return of one or two jiao to about four jiao, only the whole six small ones were seven or eight jiao, and the 18 customs and the demobilization for this month both rose by one jiao. The total turnover was 11,187,300 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods, and the unified salt tax for futures accounted for 4,950,000, demobilization accounted for 1,900,000, 19 customs and good deeds accounted for 1,895,000 yuan, and 20 volumes and 20 customs accounted for 2,380,000, while the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 745,000.</p>
<h3 id="e220">New York Stock Market Remains Depressed <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on Friday (19th) was seeing profit-taking from bullish positions, so the situation remained depressed. Later, due to continued good commercial news and short covering, the market situation rose slightly. Traders were waiting for the development of the government's construction plan and were obviously watching and waiting. The total turnover for the day was 3,280,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 81.75 Fell 0.82</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 38.46 Fell 0.16</p>
<p>20 Public Utility Stocks 27.88 Fell 0.72</p>
<p>40 Bonds 82.00 Rose 0.35</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly tired, but the situation is still high, because real demand continues to come, and procurement in the South China region is very smooth, resulting in a good mood. However, some long positions have closed with profits, and the market trend is easing. Judging from the current situation, there is a possibility of temporary stability.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Human Standards Slightly Soft <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The human standard opened before noon, with a calm mood due to the fall in foreign cotton, but there were not many sellers. Each month fell seven or eight jiao. When it was auctioned, buying households suddenly became active, and each [unit] rose by one yuan seven or eight jiao. The second closing saw a return to the road, and as a result, each household fell two, three, four, five, and seven jiao. The afternoon market atmosphere was flat, and each [unit] stepped down four or five jiao. The total turnover for the whole day was 19,100 bales. It was found that Da Yi sold 2,100 bales, Rong Xing sold 1,750 bales, Sen Kang sold 4,800 bales, and Tai Chang sold 2,000 bales.

<p>The current yarn is still selling well. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 2,100 bales for the whole day. Prices rose from five jiao to one yuan. Yong An Factory opened 2,000 bales of Jincheng 10-count yarn, priced at 170 yuan for June-July delivery. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market, which had been rising for many days, saw a slight decline, because US and Indian cotton softened, and the mood was slightly weak. Generally, scattered long positions closed, but some had the idea of buying more on the dip due to the scarcity of inventory. Therefore, the competition between the long and short sides was still strong.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Zheng Biao Slightly Declines <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened with market sentiment still high, but the second and third tiers weakened. Prices for each month fell by four to five jiao.

<p>New York, May 19th telegram reports on the cotton market situation for the week: After German Chancellor Hitler's speech in Congress, raw cotton prices rose sharply, but soon there was a reaction trend, with reduced activity by buyers and gradually shrinking transaction volumes. Except for some areas in Texas and the northern and central cotton belt, the new cotton crop is progressing better this month, but it is still delayed by one to three weeks. There are continued reports of large-volume cotton transactions. It is reported that the cotton held by the Red Cross, except for approximately 170,000 bales stored in New York, has been dispersed. According to Washington news, the issue of how to receive the remaining old cotton that was previously stockpiled with government financial assistance is currently being discussed based on the installment sales terms of the rural relief plan. Regarding cotton field control under the rural relief plan, there is currently no concrete development, but Senator Smith, who initiated the installment sales plan, believes that this year's cotton season started late, so cotton fields can be reduced by five to six million acres.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea - The Weather Is Unfavorable and Silkworm Diseases Are Rampant</p>
<h3 id="e229">Jiangning <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>This year, farmers in various cities and villages have only raised about 50-60% of the silkworms compared to last year due to economic difficulties. However, the silkworm seeds were mostly improved varieties. In the Xiaodanyang area, some farmers, lacking the funds to purchase improved seeds, raised local varieties. The weather was initially very good, and with the assistance of instructors, the silkworms developed smoothly. The earliest local variety silkworms are now emerging, with some starting to spin cocoons. The improved variety silkworms are also in their fourth molt, eating vigorously. Unexpectedly, in recent days, there have been repeated thunderstorms, resulting in hot and humid conditions followed by sudden cold, causing climate imbalances and a sudden increase in humidity. The local variety silkworms, even with sufficient food, are delayed in emerging. The silkworms that have started spinning cocoons are breaking their silk due to the thunder. The vigorous foreign variety silkworms are also experiencing a sudden decrease in appetite, sluggish movement, and the development of hardened skin disease. There are reports of silkworms developing yellow excrement after eating leaves wet with rain, resulting in losses. As the silkworms are about to spin cocoons, this represents a failure at the final stage. The silkworm farmers are all crying out in despair. The instructors are currently trying to provide assistance by artificially adjusting the temperature and humidity and cleaning the silkworm rearing rooms and tools.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Hang County <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>In the Linping area, the early batch of local variety silkworms have suffered damage from the weather, with many remaining silkworms. Farmers are starting to raise improved varieties to compensate. The silkworms are eating vigorously, and the instructors are actively providing guidance. In addition, the weather is warm and favorable, and the development is very good. The early batch of local silkworms are in their major molt and eating vigorously, while the late batch of foreign variety silkworms are also in their third molt and eating sufficiently. However, in recent days, there have been consecutive thunderstorms, with hot and humid conditions followed by sudden cold, causing changes. The early silkworms of the local variety in the upper and lower four villages have developed black spots on their bodies (commonly known as maggot disease), as well as swollen bodies that rot and smell after death (commonly known as puffy disease). Even the foreign variety silkworms are eating less and developing white excrement. Some are experiencing yellow excrement after eating wet leaves and spitting out black liquid. The instructors are currently taking measures to remove diseased silkworms to prevent the spread of the disease, and are also adjusting the temperature and humidity in the silkworm rearing rooms in coordination with the silkworm farmers to provide careful rearing in the hope of making up for the losses.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Both Black and Green Tea Transactions Are Slow <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day after the opening of the Qimen tea market. Due to telegrams from London indicating tight prices for Qimen black tea, English merchants showed little interest in buying. Only Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and other firms made some scattered purchases. The market sentiment was not considered good. The green tea market was also deserted. New prices for Tunxi's core-extracted Zhenmei tea have not yet been released, and the sales of Suian Zhenmei tea remain sluggish. Only local Zhuang needle tea and pearl tea items are in some demand from French traders. The trend of the tea market is quite pessimistic.</p>
<p>Grain Prices Rise Due to Rainy Weather</p>

<p>There were more than 30 sources of supply. The market situation was strong due to heavy rain, and sellers were quoting high prices. However, those trying to sell Qingjiao thin rice wrapped in bags were still trying to hold firm, demanding high prices, which led to no transactions. Only Fengjing and Songjiang rice were purchased, totaling nearly 1,000 bags. Therefore, only special and inferior Qingjiao thin rice were sold. Su, Tong, and more Nangang thick rice, as well as West Lian rice, were selling at good prices, with prices rising slightly. If the market clears, it may still not be able to gain a foothold. Duyang tip rice continued to rise slightly due to a shortage of supply. Yinbianyuan rice remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e233">North Shanghai <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>There were 27 or 28 sources of supply from various routes in Hexia. White Geng rice was selling well in the morning market, causing prices to be quoted higher. However, the market weakened in the afternoon, and the market sentiment became tight, rising slightly. The price of early thin rice was stable, and the price of various pointed rice was flat and normal. Yinbianyuan rice showed a slightly weak trend.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Wenzhou Merchants Arranging for the Loading of Foreign Rice <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>▲ 客秈運閩途沉六千包…閩辦暫停</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wenzhou merchants became active again, inquiring about foreign Ke Xian rice in the market. There was originally hope for an upward trend in the foreign Ke Xian rice market, but the Wenzhou merchants suddenly stopped buying. Recently, the Ke Xian rice market has been supported entirely by Fujian merchants. Once the Fujian merchants stop buying, the market immediately shrinks. The reason for the Fujian merchants' suspension yesterday was that 6,000 bags of Ke Xian rice that they had purchased the day before, loaded onto the He'an ship for transport to Fujian, sank after the ship was loaded and was turning to leave the dock, after being hit by a foreign merchant ship. All 6,000 bags of rice loaded were impossible to salvage. Some of the Fujian merchants had not purchased sufficient marine insurance, and were therefore seeking remedies. The merchants were unable to continue buying in the market yesterday, so the market was quiet. However, after this loss of 6,000 bags, the merchants will inevitably need to replenish their stock in the market in the coming days, so the trading outlook is optimistic. Yesterday, the Wenzhou merchants purchased 142 bags of Hunan coarse Qing rice for 6.65 yuan, and also purchased 1,000 bags of returned Xiaojiao rice from merchants for 7.60 to 7.58 yuan, an increase of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous market, due to the support of foreign merchants and optimistic sentiment. Mainland merchants also tried to purchase 200 bags of Hunan Pijing rice for 6.777 yuan. In addition, merchants from this street and Fujian merchants purchased 700 bags of Anhui Hunan Guanji rice for 6 yuan. Other transactions were not disclosed.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Marked Flour and Wheat Prices Plunge After Rising <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months showed signs of rising, although the quoted price for foreign wheat was down by about 0.10 yuan. However, the market sentiment was influenced by the easing of tensions in Tianjin and the continuous torrential rains, which inevitably affected the prospects for new wheat. Therefore, after the opening prices, the market rose, with prices increasing by more than 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Trading in various lots was also exceptionally brisk. It was reported that merchants from Yingkou were also buying, so the market was generally good. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, prices for various months plummeted again, due to rumors in the market that the situation in Tianjin had become chaotic, and the weather turning clear, which caused many speculators to sell off their holdings. In addition, large factories also began to sell, causing the market to decline further. Judging from the subsequent market conditions, if the situation in the north does change, the flour market will inevitably be difficult to recover. As a result, the current month's price fell by 0.0125 yuan compared to the previous day, the June price fell by 0.02 yuan, the July price fell by 0.015 yuan, the August price fell by 0.0025 yuan, the September price fell by 0.0005 yuan, and the October price fell by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices initially rose and then fell. In the morning, due to the continuous rain and cold weather, observers inside and outside the industry believed that the new wheat crop would be greatly discounted. In addition, the flour market was also doing well, and buying interest was strong. There were few sellers, and they were all raising prices. Therefore, prices for July, August, and September rose by 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 yuan, respectively, compared to the previous day. However, in the afternoon, the market became quiet again. The weather had cleared, and the flour market had fallen back, causing opening prices to be unfavorable. Prices subsequently softened. As a result, the current month's price rose by 0.02 yuan, while the prices for August and September each fell by a small amount of 0.01 yuan. The remaining months did not open.</p>
<h3 id="e236">New Wenzhou Broad Beans Open at 5 Yuan <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Due to continuous rain in Wenzhou, the shipment of new broad beans to Shanghai has been delayed. The first batch of 30 bags arrived yesterday via the Guangji ship. Although the beans were small, they were of good quality and color. They were purchased by merchants from Tianjin and opened at 5 yuan. With the arrival of new goods this year, most buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, there is no rush to buy the new beans, and the market is stable. It is feared that it will be difficult to maintain this price in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Sugar Market: Dutch Raw Sugar Falls by 0.10 Yuan <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened as the benchmark gold price fell slightly and the Dutch exchange rate rebounded. In addition, there were no shipments scheduled for today (weekend). The association's listed prices were 20.60 yuan for 24-grade coarse granulated white sugar and 20 yuan for 20-grade medium granulated white sugar, but no transactions were made. The price for 8-9 grade Dutch sugar was 16.60 yuan, which was traded, down 0.10 yuan from the previous day. Changxing Bank quoted 21.70 yuan for RA fine Dutch white sugar, Guanghua Factory quoted 20.08 yuan for Lu brand sugar, and 20.10 yuan for ground granulated sugar in wide packaging. The factory price offered by Zhenji was 19.90 yuan for No. 1 fine white sugar, down 0.02 yuan from the previous day. The prices for the other grades (2, 3, 4, and 5) were lowered accordingly. Among the trademarked sugar, Chaozhou merchants offered dozens of bags of pure cotton red sugar at 15.37 to 15.30 yuan, and Chaoqing offered one hundred and several dozen bags at 12.10 to 11.85 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have been scarce, and the existing inventory is low. It has been found that the price in Wuhan has rebounded to 36.5 to 37 taels per stone. Here, the prices of medium-grade seeds have risen by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. For example, Xiangtan lotus seeds are 84 yuan, Raozhou Jiuxi Jinshi lotus seeds are 80 yuan, Hengzhou lotus seeds are 79 yuan, and Changde lotus seeds are 78 yuan. Sales have picked up slightly. However, the price of white lotus seeds, with Guangdong sales taking a wait-and-see approach, is still only 70 yuan, despite the low inventory.</p>

<p>Recently, transactions of new iron wire have been very rare. Even the Changjiang merchants, who have long been known for their strong sales, and the Wenzhou and Fujian merchants have no sales outlets. The intake of local factories is also limited. However, shipments continue to arrive frequently, so the accumulated inventory is sufficient for three to four months of sales. Market sentiment is therefore very weak. The quoted price for No. 16 to No. 20 wire is 18.75 yuan per dan, down 0.50 yuan from the previous day. The quoted price for No. 21 to No. 25 wire is 19.30 yuan, also down 0.45 yuan from the previous day. It has been found that the total sales in the city for the past three or four days have been only 30 to 40 barrels.</p>

<p>2-foot by 6-foot 18-gauge black iron sheets are currently in short supply due to purchases by enamel factories and merchants. The market price is not enough for sales. The standard price is rising steadily, and the current price can be as high as 13 yuan per dan, up 0.03 yuan from the previous day. However, buyers remain enthusiastic, so the market is inevitably facing a shortage. Recently, traders, facing the lack of spot goods, have been ordering futures from overseas, and spot goods are expected to arrive in two to three months.</p>

<p>— Ying Pingdan</p>
<p>Whether it's socializing or writing articles, besides the host, there's always an "escort." Because with an escort, you feel lively and vivid; otherwise, it's lonely and you can't get up the interest.</p>
<p>"Those who have money contribute money; those who have strength contribute strength." On the surface, we see that contributing money is for saving the country, and contributing strength is also for saving the country. Looking at the current situation: contributing money and contributing strength are equally urgently needed, because the lack of equipment certainly requires money. At the same time, a weak military force, especially, requires strength. In fact, this view still hasn't grasped the deep meaning of the article writer. If you understand it, you'll surely know: "Those who have money contribute money" is the host; "Those who have strength contribute strength" is the guest. Because needing money is the main point of the article, while needing strength is just written casually, not the main meaning of the text.</p>
<p>Although I dare not boast of "understanding books in between," I can dare to admit that "understanding the heart is not far away." Because reading similar articles is not new to me. For example, the previous "Saving the country by storing money," "Saving the country by redeeming roads," "Saving the country by ××," etc., all used this same writing style.</p>
<p>If someone says I'm arbitrary, or laughs at my paranoia, then I can frankly say: Regarding "those who have money," isn't there a very meticulous opening of a "contributing money" path for them—saving the country through aviation? But what about the "strength" aspect? Aren't those "powerful" people who really want to "contribute strength" still clenching their fists and waiting with a belly full of anger?</p>

<p>— Mou Zhui</p>
<p>— Rural Life Sketch</p>
<p>The spatula keeps shoveling, with a "chachacha" sound, mixed with the "lili lala" sounds of mustard greens in the pot.</p>
<p>Aunt Shen, with her hair disheveled, strands of hair sticking to her oily forehead.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Burn it hotter!" She put down the spatula and shouted towards the stove door, wiping the sweat on her forehead with her sleeve.</p>
<p>There was no answer. The fire starter, Lai Tou Agou, was curled up at the stove door, looking like a tailor, lying there blowing on the fire. But hard beans couldn't be lit for a while. Agou hurriedly tried to find matches, but unexpectedly a puff of white smoke came out of the stove, shining brightly, the bean shells burst, the fire liver was on fire; the fire tongue rolled out of the stove door, wrapping and wrapping, Lai Tou Agou's newly shaved shiny head and a black face, were illuminated by the fire tongue, and glowing brightly.</p>
<p>The pot screamed again, lili lala.</p>
<p>Chachacha! The spatula kept shoveling. Aunt Shen, her head and face immersed in the green steam, pouting her little lips, her eyes wrinkled, and completely covered with tears.</p>
<p>"Little devil!" She couldn't help stamping her feet and screaming: "When it's not hot, it's not hot, but when it's hot, it's all at once!"</p>
<p>Agou still didn't make a sound, holding a large piece of cold ash and pressing it on the raging fire.</p>
<p>Aunt Shen skillfully added sugar, soy sauce, and wine, and put on the pot lid.</p>
<p>But another pot lid was opened. White steam was flying, flying, and the fragrance of meat spread throughout the kitchen. Looking at the pieces of meat in the pot, she, Aunt Shen, remembered her mother-in-law's instructions:</p>
<p>"You can't cook too much meat, or there won't be any big pieces left. These servants, they all drag the big pieces into their bowls, they're not people who appreciate good food... Meat prices are so expensive, and they add water... We can't cut the pieces too big anymore. It's too hard to farm now!..."</p>
<p>But today's meat pieces are overcooked. "Agou, little devil, it's my bad luck to have this little devil cooking!" She complained in her heart.</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four: one, two, three, ... four pieces per person, thirty-two pieces in a bowl,...</p>
<p>Aunt Shen counted in her heart, filling three large bowls with meat pieces.</p>
<p>The pot lid of the mustard greens was opened again. Scooping up some vegetable soup, she brought it to her lips, blew on it, took a sip, pursed her lips, and wrinkled her brow:</p>
<p>"Too bland."</p>
<p>Muttering, she grabbed a handful of salt and threw it into the pot. On the stove surface, copper spoons, spatulas, oil bottles, dishcloths, vegetable bowls... were placed haphazardly.</p>
<p>"Salty vegetable soup, bean sprouts, mustard greens, meat, all four are here!" She glared at the vegetable bowls on the stove: "Agou, little devil!" She shouted sharply, "Are you comfortable sitting there? Hurry up and get the wine, and take the vegetable bowls out. The field workers are coming back to eat."</p>
<p>Aunt Shen hurriedly cleared a space on the stove surface, picked up a rice basket and put it down, removed the lid of the rice pot, and then took a spatula from the knife rack, mixing the white rice and wheat bran into the basket. Her face, steamed in the hot air of the rice, finally showed a smile:</p>
<p>"Okay, just waiting for the field workers to come back to eat."</p>
<p>She breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>— Zhou Guangxi</p>
<p>It was that time again when the wheat ears grew to half a person's height. Little Gouzi didn't even graze the cow. He stood on the edge of the wheat field, staring blankly at the setting sun.</p>
<p>He knew that Xiao Qiao'er would pass by his field at this time every day, because it should be the time for Xiao Qiao'er to go back from the fields. He thought that he wouldn't let this little girl run away this time. Every time she stirred up his anger, she would slip away, laughing at him from afar.</p>
<p>Xiao Qiao'er really came, stepping on her own long shadow. She greeted Little Gouzi with a smile. Little Gouzi followed her from the edge of the wheat field, and Little Gouzi started singing.</p>
<p>Clever girl's head is like a foreign building,</p>
<p>Clever girl's feet are like cow horns,</p>
<p>Clever girl's hands are like steamed buns,</p>
<p>Clever girl's waist is like a rush bag,…</p>
<p>Xiao Qiao'er scolded him: "You wag your tongue, you scold your auntie..." Little Gouzi laughed, but he didn't answer. He kept singing.</p>
<p>Clever girl's back is like bean curd sheets,</p>
<p>Clever girl's shoulders are like soap pods,</p>
<p>Clever girl's eyes are like morning stars,</p>
<p>Clever girl's breasts are like…</p>
<p>Xiao Qiao'er said, "I'll hit you, tear your mouth," and she turned around to grab his little braid. He reached out and touched her chest, and his hand slipped further down. Xiao Qiao'er got anxious and grabbed his braid to fight with him. He hugged her waist, and the two of them rolled from the edge of the wheat field into the wheat patch.</p>
<p>The sun had already set, and a vast twilight covered the earth. As the evening breeze passed, the wheat ears rippled like water waves. A few clusters of wheat ears, trembling urgently, were also slowly hidden by the darkness.</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>The next morning, the dew was not yet dry, and Little Gouzi followed his father past this wheat field. His father discovered a pile of wheat that had been trampled down in the wheat field. "Damn it," he cursed, "Another little bastard, without a mother or father, has nowhere to have fun, and comes to have fun in my wheat field. Gouzi, go and pick it up."</p>
<p>Little Gouzi blushed and silently went to fix the broken wheat roots. He thought of Xiao Qiao'er, and everything that happened in this place yesterday evening, and he became confused again.</p>
<p>"What are you spacing out about? Hurry up and leave!" His father roared at Little Gouzi. How could an old man understand a young man's thoughts?</p>

<p>Japanese person Fukutomi Oribe wrote the book "Fart," which compiles all the literature about farts, up to 200,000 words. Among them, the most important are the science of farts, famous fart people throughout history, Hiraga Gennai's masterpiece ("Theory on Farting, Examination of Bent Farts"), the comedies and tragedies of farts, as well as legends, fairy tales, jokes, and crazy songs related to farts. It can be said to be the culmination of fart literature, and it is indeed unique throughout history. Domestic scholars have translated many Japanese books, but this book is missing, which is a pity. However, perhaps Mr. Wu Zhihui's article can replace it, so that there is no regret? In the article "What We Petition to Mr. Zhang Shizhao," Mr. Wu recounted that when he was 31 years old, he returned home from Beijing, and found a book called "How Can This Be Reasonable" on a small book stall. As soon as he opened it, he said, "Fart, fart, it's really unreasonable." Suddenly, he realized that he should despise the literati and not become one. Even if he was involved in writing, he would do it with the spirit of "fart, fart, it's really unreasonable." ...But there was a dull clerk in a small shop, working as a proofreader at the Shanghai Medical Bookstore, who borrowed 700 yuan and searched for the dog farts that I had scattered in newspapers and magazines, and even found the school essays from thirty years ago and engraved a collection of essays. That's really terrible..." It can be seen that Mr. Wu's writing, he claimed to be "farting," and it was "dog farts" rather than human farts. He had the cleverness of self-awareness, which was a great exaggeration for writers. It is precisely this old man's inability to achieve this. Unfortunately, the Chinese people do not understand humor. Doctors and scholars regard Mr. Wu as one of the greatest thinkers of China in the past three hundred years, revolutionary comrades regard Mr. Wu as a theorist in the party, and newspaper reporters even strongly invite Mr. Wu to talk and write articles. This is exactly what Mr. Wu called "really terrible." Dr. Liu Fu once punctuated and published the book "How Can This Be Reasonable" (i.e., He Dian), recommending it as Mr. Wu's teacher in writing. Although he has a way to make money, he is also unreasonable in farting. Yuan Jiang Zhengzi's Mountain House Random Notes records that Lin Guanguo of Sanshan, at the age of seven, roamed the city and claimed to sell plans. Someone jokingly asked him to chant about turning arrow qi, and he wrote the poem:</p>
<p>Look at it and you can't see it, named Xi,</p>
<p>Listen to it and you can't hear it, named Yi.</p>
<p>It's as if it came from its mouth,</p>
<p>Everyone covers their noses and passes by.</p>
<p>The so-called turning arrow qi, other books may write it as turning loss of qi, which is wrong. Arrow in the Book of Han is written as shit, and ancient shit and arrow are interchangeable. Arrow qi is a fart, it is the qi of the arrow. Turning is a verb, the same nature as letting go. The medical book says that the lower jiao spills qi, which belongs to this qi. In a slightly more scientific way, it can be said that it is the stinky gas discharged from the intestines and stomach. If you say it is a fart, the language is not elegant, and Western-dressed gentlemen and high-class Chinese people seem to find it difficult to say. Lin Guanguo's poem on turning arrow qi has a title that seems turbid, but the words are elegant. This is the best of fart articles. Lin Guanguo was a child prodigy, while Mr. Wu Zhihui can be called a holy old man, and Mr. Liu Fu is a dignified doctor. I am discussing farting, and I am honored to be able to look up to them and have something to do with them.</p>
<p>After writing this article, I remembered that when I was at "Dongda," I once listened to Mr. Gu Shi's lecture on philology. He wrote a pictographic dog character on the blackboard, and then wrote the four characters "Hu Shi's Literary Collection" in large letters at the root of the dog's tail. Those who saw it laughed in the hall.</p>

<p>Afterward, she kissed him on the forehead, lest he be jealous.</p>
<p>The arrival of the holidays made Carrot Top so happy that he actually burst into tears. He was often like that; he often expressed his emotions incorrectly.</p>
<p>On the day school started (the date was Monday morning, October 2nd; starting with the Mass of the Holy Spirit), Mrs. Lepic, listening from afar to the bells of the public carriage, bent down and hugged her children tightly. Carrot Top was not included in this embrace. He earnestly hoped that it would be his turn, his hand already reaching for the strap above the carriage, the farewell words already prepared, he was so mournful that even his voice changed.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my mother," he said, feigning a solemn expression.</p>
<p>"Hey, what do you take me for, you clown?" Mrs. Lepic said. "Would you lose money by calling me 'Mama' like everyone else? Who has ever seen such a thing? A child who still smells of milk trying to act grown-up is truly strange!"</p>
<p>But she still kissed him on the forehead, lest he be jealous.</p>
<p>Pen</p>
<p>The Saint Marc school, where Mr. Lepic sent his eldest son, Felix, and Carrot Top to board, had students who attended public middle school. They took the same walk four times a day. On beautiful spring and autumn days, this walk was very pleasant; even on rainy days, because the distance was very short, the young men would only feel cool and would not get soaked. So, this kind of walk was very beneficial to the body year-round.</p>
<p>This morning, they were returning from middle school again, walking slowly like sheep. Carrot Top, who was looking down and moving forward, suddenly heard someone say:</p>
<p>"Carrot Top, look, your father is over there!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic liked to surprise his children like this. He didn't write to inform them before he came. He let them suddenly see him, standing on the sidewalk across the street, his hands behind his back, a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>Carrot Top and his older brother Felix jumped out of the line and ran to their father.</p>
<p>"Really!" Carrot Top said, "Even though I was thinking about someone, it wasn't about you."</p>
<p>"You only think about me when you see me," Mr. Lepic said.</p>
<p>Carrot Top wanted to say a few affectionate words, but he was so flustered that he couldn't think of anything. He stood on his tiptoes, wanting to hug and kiss his father. The first time, his lips touched his mustache. But Mr. Lepic seemed to deliberately avoid him, mechanically raising his head. Then he bent down again and leaned back, wanting to kiss Carrot Top on the cheek, but he didn't reach it. He only touched his nose. His kiss missed. He didn't push further, but he felt strange in his heart, wondering why his father would treat him like this.</p>
<p>"Does Dad not like me?" he thought. "I saw him hug and kiss my older brother Felix. He let him hug and kiss him, he didn't avoid him. Why is he dodging me? Does he want to make me jealous? I always feel like I miss my parents very much if I don't see them for three months. I was ready to jump on their necks like a puppy. We mutually enjoy each other's caresses as much as possible. But as soon as I see them, it makes me feel half cold."</p>
<p>Because he only wanted to think about these things sadly, Carrot Top didn't answer Mr. Lepic's questions properly. At this time, Mr. Lepic asked him if he had made any progress in Greek.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: It depends on which aspect. It's easier to translate Greek into French than to translate French into Greek. Because when translating Greek into French, we can guess some of the meaning. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e246">The Struggle After Losing a Country is Very Difficult! <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Recently, someone said: "The majority of Chinese people have a very small concept of the nation, and in recent years, the general trend has been to blindly admire the sights, sounds, and goods of foreigners. Apart from the antiques of Peking, the Chinese people do not cherish or protect anything that is originally Chinese. Under this mentality, the Chinese nation must experience the pain of losing its country once, otherwise, it will probably not be easy to rise 'in time.'" This argument is undoubtedly a painful and heartbreaking criticism, but what we must pay attention to is whether it is easy to "rise" after experiencing the pain of losing a country?</p>
<p>According to recent reports in Japanese newspapers about the Korean independence movement: about 30 officials and police officers from the Osaka Port Police Station recently searched the home of Korean Zhang Shiyuan, who runs a maritime transport business in the port area, and arrested 40 people, including Hyun Gil-young, the head of the East Asia Navigation Cooperative, Kim In-dong, the clerk of the Jeju Island route Fubuki Maru, and Shen Won-sik, the cargo manager, as well as two young girls. They were interrogated by the Osaka Prefecture Special Criminal Higher Section and determined that Hyun Gil-young and others had an organization for the independence movement, and the East Asia Navigation Cooperative was its organizational body. The East Asia Navigation Cooperative was established 13 years ago with funds raised by Korean expatriates, calling on people from their hometown to travel on hometown ships. They purchased the Fubuki Maru and organized a shipping company. Currently, it has more than 500 members. Recently, they took advantage of the crowded Osaka pier on the 1st and 16th of each month to distribute various radical leaflets promoting the restoration of Korea, which attracted the attention of the police, who were on high alert and recently made arrests.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have often heard news of the Japanese breaking up Korean independence movement organizations. Each time there is a crackdown, there is always bloodshed and sacrifice by some Korean patriots. This relentless independence movement really fills us with infinite emotion and shame. Thinking about how easy it was for the Japanese to destroy Korea back then, and how difficult it is for Koreans to try to restore their country today, this is indeed a fact that those who are complacent and have not yet become slaves of a lost country should deeply reflect on.</p>

<p>— Lin Jieyu</p>
<p>Candidate Police Officer</p>
<p>Life is moving forward with difficulty, and fate is playing with me. I have drifted to the land of × like floating clouds and flowing water. With the active efforts of my loyal friend Lao Wu, I am preparing to be introduced to a small city nearby to serve as a police officer. But Lao Wu didn't have time to go, so he asked Mrs. Wu to take me, because Mrs. Wu also had some connections with the head of the public security bureau. Mrs. Wu reluctantly agreed, and I immediately acted like a sensible servant, respectfully serving her on her journey.</p>
<p>When we arrived there, the bureau chief was not at home, and the bureau chief's wife was not there either, but the bureau chief's daughter was at home, a sallow-faced, low-browed, lifeless young lady who greeted us woodenly. After waiting for a long time, the bureau chief returned. He asked about my experience, frowned, and said a lot of "there's no way." Finally, after countless headshakes and regrets, he said with a sigh: I hereby appoint so-and-so as a probationary policeman at the × police station, and you must comply and report for duty immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Yin-Yang Blessed Land <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Meizhuang</p>
<p>Police Officer</p>
<p>I am a young man who has received secondary education, an intellectual who is weak and unable to truss a chicken, but now I have actually run to the land of × to become a policeman, replacing the pen with a gun.</p>
<p>Our police station is located in a temple. When I was first led to this place, the goddess with three eyes greeted me with a humble smile. The name of the temple cannot be found. I only saw a signboard above it, arrogantly writing the four characters "Yin-Yang Blessed Land," which made me shudder and think of this as the edge of life and death. The temple is full of goddesses and little ghosts, and the air is filled with an incongruous atmosphere of tenderness and barbarity. The walls are covered with enigmatic paintings: a tiger with a big tail, a pointed mouth, small eyes, and covered in fur; a monk with a dog crawling on his head; a person with a head growing out of their navel; a dazed-looking man wearing broken shoes, with a sparrow flying out of his mouth: everything makes one feel the mystery and melancholy of life.</p>
<p>There are seven people in the station: a patrol leader, a cook, two gate guards, and three street guards. The patrol leader, the cook, and another brother are all locals; the rest: one from Guangxi, two from Zhili, and one from Hubei. The patrol leader is a big guy with thick eyebrows and large eyes, looking like a battle-ax made of meat; but the sound of his voice is like a broken gong that cannot be struck. The cook is the exact opposite, as thin as a reed, clenching his teeth all day long and not opening his mouth, as if he had sworn an oath never to speak. The other one is a drunkard who indulges in distiller's grains, with a bald head and a red face that constantly emits steam, muttering indistinctly, one can tell at a glance that he is soaked in liquor. The four outsiders are all tall and gaunt. They are all farmers who enjoy guarding their fields and being self-sufficient. The storms of history swept them away from their hometowns, and finally, they settled in this desolate corner. Life passes silently, and they twist and turn on the edge of hunger and death in silence. Usually, they seem to be nonchalant: laughing loudly, spitting everywhere, excitedly talking about someone else's "wife" and her affair with a monk. But when someone inadvertently mentions words like "hometown," "parents," "family," they immediately become quiet; and become old, weak: their heads droop, their hands hugging their knees, their chins resting on them, silently staring at the ground, sadness suffocating them!</p>
<p>At night, because there was no room for the other brothers to sleep, I slept in the main hall, finding two high and low tables to replace the bed. The fat patrol leader kindly found me a broken mattress. The blue-black cloth surface was covered with dust and grease, and the dark holes exuded a stuffy stench, and it seemed as if countless caterpillars were wriggling inside. The main hall was empty and vast, piled with lime and broken tiles, and filled with the breath of dampness, soil, and decaying wood, suggesting decay and disease. In front of the statue, incense ash and candle tears lingered, like a helpless old woman, sadly shedding her endless tears.</p>
<p>Darkness crept in through the holes in the window lattices, filling the main hall, and the eternal light slowly emitted a dim flame 丨丨 it is always silent during the day. The streamers in front of the statue 丨 congealed by cobwebs and dust 丨 issued a faint sigh in the air, resenting its eternal idleness and loneliness.</p>
<p>There are two goddesses, two deities, and eight little ghosts in front of my bed. The goddesses always have gentle smiles; the deities are full of petty bourgeois sentiments, sadly lamenting the decline of their majesty. As for those little ghosts, they are all the same, holding bamboo sticks in their hands, feathers of pheasants on their heads, full of fierce faces and rogue air; looking at the short railing in front of them that hinders their actions with an evil gaze, expressing their infinite anger.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew in from the holes in the window lattices, and the flame of the eternal light became drowsy. Old mice and small mice ran around in groups, calling and sniffing everywhere. In the air, coldness, like an invisible ghost, crept into the broken quilt to attack my body, and my body temperature was quickly sucked away by it.</p>
<p>The light in the main hall was as thin as hell, the spirits of darkness crawled everywhere, the murals floated like ghosts, and the turbidity of the air suffocated people. I was thrown into this "blessed land" to enjoy myself by what strange fate, I couldn't help but laugh loudly as I slept on the uneven bed.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Talking About Scientific Management <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Hengyuan</p>
<p>Under the extreme panic of capitalist economy, in order to save the economic crisis and recession, there must be new and higher technologies and plans to understand and apply to increase economic efficiency, so as to eliminate the various wastes in the past economy and return it to a state of recovery. Therefore, scientific management has become an inevitable product, first advocated by American iron factory technician Taylor, and later studied by many politicians, industrialists, and bankers, it gradually became popular and put into practice. It was then successively adopted by countries such as England and Germany, and became a temporary savior in the economic world of the entire capitalist world. Since scientific management has become an important factor in the entire capitalist economy, the importance of its significance can be imagined. According to general statements, scientific management is a technique and plan application that promotes economic improvement. Its purpose is to improve the quality of goods, increase the quantity of goods, reduce the cost and price of goods, and enrich the welfare of the national economy, so it is an economic, progressive, and functional thing.</p>
<p>In capitalist countries, generally speaking, the first problem of scientific management is the concentration of capital, which is also called the union movement. The method of union is divided into vertical and horizontal types. Vertical union is the union of organizations related to production methods, linking from the acquisition of raw materials to the manufacture of goods into a system. Horizontal union is the union of organizations with the same production nature, that is, all production institutions in the same industry are united to reduce consumption and waste, increase production efficiency, and seek a large amount of profit. Its second problem is the standardization of production methods. The first step is to handle it in a company, the second step is to handle special industries in a region by New Dica, the third step is to handle it nationwide, regardless of the nature of the industry, by Contern, and the fourth step is to jointly establish an international standards association internationally. The purpose is to (1) obtain the greatest labor efficiency with the least effort, (2) reduce various different styles of goods as the basis (styles are different but there is no obvious benefit), study manufacturing methods, (3) eliminate the consumption of raw materials and power, (4) simplify the distribution of goods, (5) eliminate unnecessary transportation, excessive financial burdens, and useless intermediaries. According to this, (1) in the social aspect, the standard of living can be improved, and stability can be increased, (2) in the consumption aspect, prices can be reduced, and goods can be more in line with needs, (3) in the producer aspect, production can be fairly distributed and its benefits can be obtained, so that it can be coordinated and parallel with centralized capital.</p>
<p>However, judging from the international economic situation in recent years, the result of scientific management in capitalism has not resolved the crisis of capitalism. According to Varga's research, at least the international economic competition has not been reduced by international scientific management, and due to the fall in the price index, the profits of capital are still unsuccessful, and it is necessary to reduce wages and lay off workers domestically, so that the real wages of workers are falling day by day, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. On the other hand, it also increases workers' diseases and disasters, and inevitably leads to a general shortening of workers' lives and a reduction in the period of labor capacity. Therefore, the lives of most workers are declining day by day, which reduces the purchasing power of the majority and makes the sales channels in the domestic market more difficult, forming a phenomenon of overproduction. Moreover, after capital is concentrated, taking advantage of domestic and foreign monopolies, even when production costs are obviously reduced, prices are not reduced, but prices are maintained at the same level, thereby increasing its profits. The so-called scientific management movement is really full of deep contradictions.</p>
<p>However, the modern form of scientific management is by no means accidental. It is the logical development of all capitalist production tendencies, and it is the clearest form of phenomenon. Needless to say, it is the final manifestation of capitalist development, a characteristic of the period of capitalist decline and disintegration.</p>
<p>In short, scientific management itself is still a kind of societal philosophy, principles, and appropriate basic technology, and its value is not harmed by the opposite results brought about by the application of capitalism. Once the right to industrial management is transferred from capitalists to all workers, it will undoubtedly exert its maximum efficiency and seek the happiness of all mankind.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Mud Doll <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Li Peilin</p>
<p>This day, when we were having lunch, the side dishes had not yet been brought out. I first occupied the head of the table and hummed "Si Lang Visits His Mother". My younger sister sat at my left, pouting her lips, holding chopsticks in her mouth, and rattling her teeth. She was angry with me because I refused to let her play with the mud doll that I had made by hand in school. But after a while, we made up because our mother was late in coming out of the kitchen. My younger sister and I competed to see who could make the spoon louder with chopsticks, to see who was more skilled, until our mother brought out the dishes.</p>
<p>As we were eating, my cousin rushed in from outside. I understood his intention, but before he could say it, I still hoped that the words he said would not be guessed by me, but he finally said to my mother the words that I didn't want him to say:</p>
<p>"The money shop that I recommended to my cousin will welcome the God of Wealth the day after tomorrow. My cousin must go in tomorrow. That money shop is a Yuan-numbered shop with 50,000 capital. Six tables of food are served for each meal!"</p>
<p>He seemed to use all his strength to say these two sentences. Then, he said: "With such a large scope, there must be several tea boys. My cousin may not have to pour the spittoon when he goes in."</p>
<p>"So, I don't have to go to school this afternoon?" I dropped my chopsticks and stared at my mother.</p>
<p>"My cousin could have stopped going to school a long time ago," my cousin said. "This way, tomorrow morning at 8:30, I will definitely accompany my cousin to the shop. You must prepare the bedding and luggage in advance. Also, don't forget to buy a pair of incense and candles, which are to be used to worship the teacher. My cousin's teacher is the deputy manager of that money shop."</p>
<p>My cousin sat for a while and left. The room was quiet with only the three of us left, all silent. I had no heart to eat the remaining half bowl of rice. My younger sister, although she didn't understand, also looked very gloomy, but after a while, she said:</p>
<p>"Brother, you are going to be an apprentice tomorrow, so you don't need that mud doll anymore. Can you give it to me?"</p>
<p>I nodded. My mother remained silent, only looking at me carefully from head to toe with moist tears. A kind of indescribable sad emotion pressed on my heart 丨 I, who has always had a strong personality, couldn't help but fall into my mother's arms and cry.</p>
<p>"Good child," my mother stroked my hair and said; "Don't be like this, you are grown up, you should act like an adult, why do you cry when you hear that you are going to be an apprentice? Didn't my cousin say just now? That money shop is very big, you won't suffer when you go in. Child, three years is very fast, when you have learned the business, Mom will be waiting here for you to earn ingots back."</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked at my mother's face. She put on an unnatural smile, stroked my face with her fingers, and said:</p>
<p>"A fifteen-year-old still wants to hide in Mom's arms and act up, aren't you ashamed?"</p>
<p>But her eyes were filled with more tears than mine. I swallowed a mouthful of saliva, my heart was sore, and tears flowed like a waterfall. I remember very clearly that since my father died, I had never cried so sadly. But if my father had not died at that time, how could I have been forced to be someone else's apprentice, and how could I have had this painful cry today? Writing this, my father's gentle face could not help but appear before my eyes again.</p>
<p>Dinner passed hastily under the shroud of such a tragic atmosphere. I really wanted to eat a little more because this was my last dinner at home, but I finally ate one bowl less than usual.</p>

<p>Because my mother had to prepare my luggage for me, she hardly spoke to me after dinner. She was just busy sorting out empty boxes, mending old socks, and sewing torn clothes. Although occasionally she would remind me about things outside, like not being lazy, not gambling, and not going out with my fellow apprentices, these words didn't seem to register with me. I was just pacing around the room, imagining the facial features of my future husband whom I would have to kneel before tomorrow. Up until now, the impression he left in my mind was that of an old-fashioned merchant in his forties or fifties, wearing a melon-shaped hat, a long blue silk gown, a stooped back, a hoarse voice, a wine-stained nose, ... and also a mouth that liked to scold students, and a difficult temperament to please.</p>
<p>In the evening, before going to bed, I glanced at the empty box my mother had prepared for me and saw that besides a few clothes, there was a lot of empty space. She asked if I wanted to put anything else in it. I thought about it and didn't think there was anything worth putting in, but my mother frowned slightly, rummaged through my bookshelf, found a Xuanmi Pagoda calligraphy model by Huang Ziyuan, and finally gently placed it in the box. At this time, my younger sister was already sound asleep in bed, and I didn't feel like playing with the clay doll anymore!</p>

<p>— Speaker Fan Xin</p>
<p>Shop assistants, apprentices, workers, and all other readers of this publication! Today, I have the opportunity to talk to you about the general living conditions of Soviet working women. I am truly honored!</p>
<p>Soviet working women are completely equal to men in all aspects.</p>
<p>The October Revolution liberated Soviet women from the shackles of managing household affairs and taking care of children, and they all went to factories or rural areas to work like men.</p>
<p>In factories, the work performance of working women often exceeds that of men. They adopted socialist competitions and commando teams to increase the rate of production and improve labor methods. They often put forward various practical and specific opinions to contribute to the factory committee.</p>
<p>Liberated working women initially only hoped to overcome illiteracy. However, after being able to read and write, they had even greater desires. They needed to acquire political knowledge, technical knowledge, cultural knowledge, etc., because they knew that they were the builders of a new life and a new world, the builders of a socialist society. After work, they mostly went to clubs for entertainment and sports, or to libraries or schools to study.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>. They didn't want to waste a minute. Naturally, they also had to fall in love. However, they had principled regulations regarding love, which was based on not hindering work or study. If anyone spent too much effort on love, they would be criticized by the public.</p>
<p>No country in the world has laws that can protect working women like the Soviet Union, especially the protection of motherhood. Working women have a total of four months of recuperation before and after childbirth, during which time their wages are still paid. After this period, when they return to work in the factory, night work, excessive work, or relatively heavy work are all prohibited for her until after a considerable period. The necessities for infants are provided by the state within nine months of birth. When working women with children go to work in factories, they can put their children in nurseries, which are established by the state or the factory where she works. There, knowledgeable teachers and experienced nannies will take care of the children so that mothers can work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet government has used nurseries, kindergartens, children's homes, public canteens, public laundries, and various cooperatives to liberate them from the daily life constraints of being a "virtuous wife and good mother."</p>
<p>The wages of Soviet working women are determined based on their level of skill. The Soviet Union provides workers with all kinds of conveniences, such as rent, food, and other necessities. Workers can obtain them at a lower price than non-workers. Moreover, every working woman has at least two weeks of vacation each year, with wages still paid. Therefore, even if the wages of Soviet working women may not be as high as those of working women in the golden United States, in essence, due to the above reasons, they exceed what is obtained by oppressed and exploited working women in various capitalist countries. Moreover, by the end of the second five-year plan, the standard of living will be increased by two or three times.</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Qualification Problem of a Poor Kid <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Shen Airong</p>
<p>I am a junior high school graduate. In the autumn of 1931, I was admitted to the kindergarten normal school attached to Jinan University. Unfortunately, the Shanghai War broke out, and Zhenru became a war zone. The kindergarten normal school, which had only been established for a few months, died prematurely, and I also lost my education. It has been a year and a half since then.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I got a very good news from a friend that students from the previous kindergarten normal school can be inserted into senior high school normal school, but they need to pay fees according to the general courses. This is such gratifying news! However, where does a member of the proletariat like me get this huge sum of money (the hostel fees and tuition fees for the previous kindergarten normal school were waived, only the meal expenses were not waived)? Although the amount is only sixty or seventy yuan, it is nothing to the rich merchants who spend thousands of dollars on smiles, and the wealthy officials who are wrapped in hundreds of thousands, but in the eyes of us poor people, it is a very large amount. Should I borrow from friends? I have never borrowed half a penny from anyone in my life, and I am really ashamed to open my mouth. Moreover, whether they believe you or not is still a question. And the relatives all say: What books are such big girls reading? It is more proper to learn some female handicrafts at home and marry early. Should I not read? Such a good opportunity, missing it is really too regrettable, because Jinan University is national, and those with scores above 75 points can be completely free, which is indeed good news for a poor kid like me. Moreover, I have had enough of the suffering of being trapped by qualifications. People without a high school diploma have to run into snags everywhere. In the past year, I don't know how much anger I have suffered for the sake of employment. No, this is the karma of a poor kid, who told you to ask for help from others? Without any brothers-in-law, younger uncles, or old uncles serving in the agency, you won't have a share in this vase-like, aristocratic position. Should I be a primary school teacher? But without registering, no matter how rich your knowledge is, you will always not be able to eat this bowl of noble leftovers. Should I be a clerk? I can't find the door. Should I be a lawyer? I don't have the aura of some legal scholars. Should I be a female worker? It is related to the face of the family. Should I be a dancer? That is not a proper female profession at all. As for the recruitment advertisements in the newspapers, I have also applied, but the letters are like the Yellow Crane never returning, and the response is like the ocean sinking, nothing more than promoting two-cent stamps for the post office. This is all because I suffer from not having qualifications, so I must become self-reliant only after graduating from high school. But I am just a poor kid, unable to do what I want, and therefore I am anxious, depressed, and disappointed. There are still three months before the start of the semester. I want to find a job, no matter how big or small, high or low, in these three months. If I can accumulate a sum of thirty to fifty yuan from this, it seems that it will be of no small help to the tuition fees for the second half of the year. Please forward the reply through this publication.</p>

<h3 id="e255">How Should Workers Maintain Their Lives When Yarn Factories Reduce Working Hours? <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Discussant and Parliamentarian Yi Ping</p>
<p>China's pitifully immature national industry is always in a position of utter defeat. Recently, due to the dumping of foreign goods and overproduction, it has deeply felt that it has reached the end of its rope and cannot maintain its business. It has no choice but to implement a two-day reduction in working hours per week in order to save itself. At the same time, Japanese-owned companies in the country, also due to the result of China and India boycotting Japanese goods, have overproduction and have begun to implement reductions in working hours. After this news spread, it aroused the attention of many people in society. It can be seen that the seriousness of this issue is no less than that of all other issues.</p>
<p>The result of reducing working hours will undoubtedly have a great impact on the workers. In fact, although "three shifts are reduced per week, each worker actually only reduces one shift, and only four or five shifts per month, each shift's wages are 60 cents, which is only worth more than two yuan," in the world's lowest-wage country, the standard of living is exactly the opposite, becoming higher day by day. The result of workers selling their blood and sweat every month is that they are generally on the verge of starvation for the lowest life. This sum of more than two yuan is tantamount to depriving the workers of one-half or even the entire portion of their monthly wages to make up for the losses of the capitalists. Moreover, the lives of Chinese people are mostly built on the foundation of extended families. Behind every worker is the burden of an extended family. The unemployment of one worker will immediately affect the livelihood of the entire family. If most of the workers become unemployed as a result, what kind of phenomenon will occur in society? That is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the destruction of the countryside, the decline in people's purchasing power, and the seizure of the virgin land in the Northeast, the original market for national goods will inevitably shrink, so there is also a so-called phenomenon of overproduction. However, according to the actual situation, it is exactly the opposite. According to last year's survey, the total number of spindles in the country was only 4,516,898, while Chinese-owned companies only had 2,589,040, accounting for about 57.31% of the total. With such a small number to supply the vast demand of the country, it is very obvious that it is insufficient. How can there be a phenomenon of overproduction? Even if the people's purchasing power is reduced to below the general level, the phenomenon of reducing working hours due to overproduction will not occur. It can be seen that the yarn factories' reduction in working hours this time is more accurately due to the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the current issue is how to resist foreign goods in order to promote national goods, rather than the issue of overproduction and implementing reductions in working hours.</p>
<p>At this time of deepening national crisis and panic, the capital side should share weal and woe with the labor side to overcome this difficult situation. They must never allow the formation of hundreds of thousands of industrial reserve troops due to the relationship of reducing working hours, causing a panic of hunger in society. On the workers' side, they should also unite and use legal means to argue on the basis of reason, and not stop until they achieve their goals. At the same time, the factory should base its spirit of sacrifice, not only should it not reduce working hours, but it should also give workers more work opportunities, so that the production of the entire nation has a significant improvement. Even if there are any difficulties, it may as well use an open attitude, standing on the position of mutual support and interdependence, and jointly request the government to implement protective policies with the power of the state. And urgently arouse the attention of all aspects of society, using the strength of the entire nation to resist the dumping of foreign goods, so that domestic goods can be sold smoothly on the land of the country. At that time, industry and commerce will be unusually developed, the national economy will also be very active, and the lives of workers will naturally be improved. The phenomenon of unemployment due to work stoppages and reductions in working hours will inevitably disappear, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>— Cao Wenzhong</p>
<p>| Career Cannot Prevent Love |</p>
<p>From the perspective of ordinary people, it seems that both husband and wife working in the film industry may endanger the happiness of the family, but Al Jolson does not object to his wife, Ruby Keeler, entering the film industry. She was originally the pillar of the Ziegfeld Follies. Since marrying Jolson on September 21, 1928, she has left the stage.</p>
<p>She has signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. Pictures. The nature of that contract is almost a birthday gift. On August 25, Warner Bros. production manager Darryl Zanuck discussed Keeler's film acting with Jolson and sought his consent. Jolson told him, "Tonight, if you prepare a contract, then tomorrow we will show it to her and it will definitely surprise her, because tomorrow is her birthday and she will be very willing to sign it."</p>
<p>Keeler signed the contract. When filming the first film, she was stipulated to have a weekly salary of $2,000, with subsequent increases in salary. Jolson is his wife's agent and manager. He is very happy with his new task and it arouses his interest.</p>
<p>He said frankly: "Of course, I am very happy that Ruby has the opportunity to appear on the screen, thereby developing her talent. She is very lonely here, often thinking about her stage career in New York. Her only reason is that she is not busy in Hollywood. If she can make movies, it can arouse her interest and make her happy. If she doesn't like making movies, she can leave."</p>
<p>"One thing is real—she will never let her career interfere with our love and our lives. Because she wanted to live with me, she deliberately fell down the stairs when she was acting on the stage. She is an extraordinary woman. She knows what is right and wrong, so I have no doubt that another movie star can be created in our family."</p>
<p>Ruby Keeler does not regard work as a lifelong career. She can join or withdraw immediately. Jolson's income is very rich. He is a generous husband, and regards it as a fresh thing to play with. Al Jolson is very supportive of his wife working in the film industry.</p>

<h3 id="e257">Thoughts After Watching "Awakening" <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zeyong</p>
<p>After Youlian Film Company dissolved last winter, Ms. Fan Xuepeng, who was famous for martial arts films, raised funds to open the Qianghua Film Company, and took the position of manager to engage in film production. Now, her first production, "Awakening," has been publicly screened at the Beijing Grand Theater since the day before yesterday (the 19th).</p>
<p>The drama's purpose is to analyze pure love and hypocritical love clearly. It can be a powerful wake-up call for modern young men and women, enlightening young men and women to recognize the true meaning of love. Because modern young men and women are increasingly on the path of depravity, that evil society cannot escape a part of the responsibility for the sin. As in this film: Yulin was tempted by the city, had a new love, and abandoned a poor Meigu, disregarding her. His lack of focus on love simply treated women as playthings. Later, Yulin's property was taken away by Yunxian, and he was left with nothing. He had to beg to Shanghai. At this time, that Meigu, who was truly "when fortune comes, it comes in pairs; when misfortune strikes, it comes alone," had become a dancer, and was also wronged and sentenced to 15 years in prison. After being released from prison, Yulin had already awakened, so he brought her back.</p>
<p>The general public who are immersed in the sea of love, if they still don't quickly "awaken" after watching this film, it is really a disservice to the film's bitter purpose!</p>
<p>This film can alert modern youth and is worthy of our emotion and admiration. Among the actors' performances, Fan Xuepeng, who plays Meigu, is the best. There is also a Yu Guang, whom we have never met, who is also acceptable. In terms of photography, some scenes are too complicated and too blurred. In terms of scenery, other things are fine, only the dance hall scene seems too unrefined. Perhaps this is restricted by capital?</p>
<p>In short, this film is much more successful than the productions of other small companies.</p>

<p>Appearing on Stage at 9:15 Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra is scheduled to hold a Chinese-Western integrated concert at the Da Guangming Cinema at 9:15 this evening (Sunday). Dr. Mei Baiqi will guide the orchestra, and Dr. Mei Lanfang will be invited to introduce it on stage. The program is as follows: (1) Selected Chinese Ancient Music (Datong Concert), (2) Pipa Solo "Huaiyin Pingchu" (Mr. Wei Zhongle), (3) Poetic Song and Play "Qingwen's Last Words" (composed by Mr. Zhu Manxin, sung by Mrs. Liu Jingfang, directed by Dr. Mei Baiqi), (4) Sound Sketch "Impressions of Beijing Hutongs" (Symphonic Poem), (5) Chinese Pantomime "Qin Xin Bo Guang". This play was composed and directed by the Russian composer Afsha Lomov, and sponsored by Dr. Mei Lanfang. The actors are Tianyi Film Company stars Yuan Meiyun and others. It is based on Chinese folk tales, compiled with pentatonic melodies, and is divided into five scenes. The structure is compact, the plot is bizarre, and the movements in the play all imitate the Chinese stage opera program.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Talking About "Powder Market" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng An</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company has made significant progress recently. The past "Mad Current" and the current "Powder Market" are all contributions that closely follow the times.</p>
<p>In terms of consciousness, "Powder Market" exposes how modern capitalists use "vases" to attract male customers, and also shows how women should create their own future. These are all "modernized" themes, but it is a pity that Gong Jianong's close following of Hu Die at the end is a bit of "adding feet to the snake."</p>
<p>Director Zhang Shichuan has made progress compared to "Lovelorn," but many places that could be depicted are lightly passed over, which is a pity. The flexibility of the division of scenes and the angles of the shots shows that domestic films are progressing.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, Hu Die's performance is very powerful, delicate and appropriate, and subtle. Gong Jianong is also very successful, but not as powerful as in "Mad Current." Wang Xianzai is also satisfactory. The other supporting roles are performed mediocrely.</p>
<p>The sound is very clear and the dialogue is also very beautiful, but some scenes are too long and dull. It would be better if they could be shorter. The background is artistic and magnificent, giving people aesthetic beauty.</p>
<p>In short, this "Powder Market" is a superior film from Mingxing Film Company.</p>
<h3 id="e260">What I Saw After Watching "New Year's Eve" <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>Recently, Lianhua's new film "New Year's Eve" has been publicly screened in Beijing again. On Saturday afternoon, there are usually no classes at the school, so I rushed to watch it.</p>
<p>However, this film gave me great disappointment. In terms of the script, it cannot be completely in line with the actual situation. Although it had previously shouted for the laboring masses, it later came up with a story of a bourgeois figure saving the poor. The old scholar in the script is righteous and generous, and the money shop owner is charitable. These are all propaganda articles for feudal ideology and traps for the bourgeoisie to oppress the masses. To put it bluntly, it is simply anesthetizing our audience. Such films with bad consciousness are really not taken by us.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside consciousness and talk about its performance skills. Then this film can be said to be worth watching. Director Jiang Qifeng's technique is very flexible. Every shot is arranged very appropriately, and the picture is very beautiful. Among them, there is a scene in which the dance hall owner and the money shop's collector fight each other on the snow, which is the best shot, but the plot of the whole film does not seem to be tense enough. Originally, "New Year's Eve" is a great tragedy, which has the possibility of making people cry, but in the end, no hot tears flowed from my eyes. This also shows that the film's power to move people is not enough.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Words About "New Year's Eve" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Qiu</p>
<p>The name "New Year's Eve" has already been very artistically titled. After watching it, I feel that the director is the most successful one in this film. Because the story of the entire film is extremely ordinary. If it is said in itself, it is just a "skillful" film, but after the director's efforts, a few powerful shots have been added, and it has become a "powerful" film.</p>
<p>Several shots, such as: the old man's surprised state after getting the wallet, and the performance of rational conflict are all very good. This is due to Liu Jiqun. In addition, like the old man's expression when he couldn't borrow money and saw three hundred yuan when he returned home, it was all very rare. Several close-ups also made people not feel repetitive after watching them.</p>
<p>Huang Shaofen's photography in this film is also much better than before in one scene of Qianghua Film Company's new film "Our Way of Life," co-starring Fan Xuepeng and Yu Guang. The light is very soft, and the scenery is also very realistic. Only the snow scene is too careless. Large pieces fell on the clothes and hats, clearly showing that these were paper pieces. I hope they can be improved in the future.</p>
<p>The actors are generally fine, especially Jiang Junchao. Although many places are over the top (like the performance when throwing himself into the river), things like meeting Chen Yanyan when he returned to the village to collect debts were very natural.</p>
<p>Although there are many places where the plot of "New Year's Eve" deviates from the facts, they have all been lightly covered up by the director's skills.</p>
<p>In summary, "New Year's Eve" is a short, creative film that depicts the ordinary process of life. If the script can be further refined and supplemented, it may become a masterpiece like "Grand Hotel." Therefore, apart from feeling that the consciousness of "New Year's Eve" is not very sound, it can generally be called a "good film."</p>

<p>Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Orlandini," she said resolutely.</p>
<p>"My name is Giovanni," he said, smiling, his large hand firmly clasping her slender, jade-like hand.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Orlandini," she said again. "I will never forget you!"</p>
<p>"You can be sure you won't forget!" he exclaimed. "Wait a moment!" He bought a bouquet of fresh flowers from a passing flower girl and tucked it into Angela's surprised arm.</p>
<p>"Orlandini, you're crazy!" she said sternly. But her eyes were hazy, as if covered with a layer of mist.</p>
<p>"Naturally, I'm crazy," he agreed readily. "Is he too?"</p>
<p>"Please go," she pleaded, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"Am I not allowed to enter?" he also implored. Then, he shook his head and asked teasingly, "Ah! This is a garden! When will you allow visitors to enter? Tomorrow? Then, Friday?"</p>
<p>"You can't! You absolutely can't!" she said. But her eyes conveyed another meaning, emitting a seductive sentiment.</p>
<p>He clicked his heels together, gave a military salute, and turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Giovanni!" she called out softly, madly.</p>
<p>"Yes?" he turned back eagerly. She extended her hand. He held her hand again.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," she said very gently.</p>
<p>He still held her hand. Time stood still in that instant. They looked at each other in silence. Then, slowly, reluctantly, they separated. Angela turned and slipped through the large iron gate, hurried up the steps, and darted into the house. She stopped by the porcelain statue of the Virgin Mary, placed the flowers Giovanni had given her at the statue's feet, and whispered happily:</p>
<p>"A young man bought these for me. His name is Giovanni. He said he loves me." Her eyes looked up at the statue, emitting a strange, mysterious glow. Then, suddenly, a shadow of doubt crossed her face. "Was that wrong, was it, was it?" she murmured resentfully. "He is such a handsome young man... If that was wrong..." She made the sign of the cross on her chest and slowly ran downstairs. Her lips moved in prayer. (To be continued)</p>
