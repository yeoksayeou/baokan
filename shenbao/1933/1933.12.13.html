<p>美國自羅斯福氏接任總統以來。用盡一切方法。以圖謀經濟恐慌之克服。如所謂復興金融公司也。産業復興法案也。頭腦托拉斯也。無一非爲穏定人心安固社會之計。詎知一年以來之努力。多屬事倍而功不及半。所謂藍魔運動。分别言之。即爲産業組織之變革。農村恐慌之救濟。土木事業之興起。金融機關之改組是。斯四者爲北美合衆國克服經濟恐慌之四大支柱。論其成績。現尚在進行之中。未易爲肯定之判斷。惟美國旣有豐富之天産。又有近百年來資本主義之技術訓練。故在世界經濟恐慌之過程中。猶有勉强支撑之餘力。設使羅斯福氏上臺後。而無藍鷹運動在産業界發生若干作用。則恐貨幣價值將愈見高漲。一般物價。愈見低落。失業人口更無法救濟。但此運動欲收得定固社會人心之全效。則殊無把握。除此以外。惟有在海外擴張市塲。奪取殖民地。方足以解决經濟恐慌。然世界地積有限。而勢力範圍之分配。又已確定。且關税戰爭旣又重興。軍備縮小問題。因德意志之執拗。復遭擱淺。故爲今日計。舍用兵外殆無重建和平之善法。</p>
<p>今有一策焉。日本行之而有效。雖未必即算是渡過難關。却能暫維現狀。此策爲何。即擴張軍需工業是也。夫日本原爲輕工業國家。於鐵。於鋼。於石油。於其他鑛産等等。均不足以與其他强國相比擬。然而竟借非常時期之名。極力擴大預算。軍備費用。一九三三年度。幾占全國總支出百分之四十以上。其於軍需工業。除直接由政府管理經營製造之外。對民間與軍事工業有關之工廠。復加以間接之補助。於是日本國内百業凋零。而軍事工業。獨欣欣向榮。最近所謂第二次海軍補充建艦計劃實行之後。造船製鋼以及其他有關各工業。必然受其刺激。市面繁榮。因軍事工業之盛况。遂感良好之影響。美國有鑒放此。第一。深感海軍實力。除主力戰艦外。如驅逐艦僅與日本相似。潛水艇。輕巡洋艦等。則美國及落日本之後。一旦太平洋上發生變故。美國將不能維持其商業上之航運。遠東市場或不免爲人所奪占。第二。美國深悉近年來日本因軍需工業之擴張。致引動産業界之活躍。矧美國海軍。對倫敦海軍條約之限制。論隻數尚少一零一艘。論噸位則缺二十萬四千餘噸。是以美國之建造三十七艘。尚多餘地。如借此而求得經濟的平衡。又增加國防之鞏。固寗不甚善。美之日的。即在於是。</p>
<p>此種海軍競爭。在九一八事變以還。太平洋風雲尚未十分緊急之際。美國能勉維其金本位制度。或可暫時緩和。現在美國。匪但以振興産業增加工資號召全國。且將採取純粹消費之軍事工業膨脹政策。一以補産業復興案之不足。二以激動彼過度頽落之人心。三則示日本以顔色。表明美國並非全無實力。暗諷日本不可過於作軍事冐險。然而遠東形勢。已經確定。戰禍終不可免。美國之大海軍政策。恐終不免激動更大之波浪也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）國聨秘書長愛文諾於英政府今日在下院開招待會時、發表爲國聨辯護文、長二千字、大旨如從前英外相貝爾福之主張、即國聨如不存在吾人亦當創成之是已、參加招待會者除團員外有兩院議員及鐵德森薛西爾等人、愛文諾稱、渠承認欲得國聨信任案之不易、以此時各國大都不信任國聨有切實處理當前大問題之能力也、軍備平等之要求、乃局勢吃緊之根本原因、但國聨盟約中從未言及平等、有人謂國聨組織應予修改、俾條約得據以修正、但迄未提出關於此種修改之具體辦法也、大多數世人現仍擁護國聨、現有必須了解者、今日世人所當取舍之兩物、不爲國聨與另一更好國際機關但爲國聨與一完全無法紀制度耳、修改或改善國聨盟約之唯一切實方法須由内發生、如抛棄盟約、則全部人類之進步將開倒車、而入於一種不可計算之時代中矣云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府邀請國聨會秘書長愛文諾午宴、並有多數要人陪席、可見英國對於秘書長及國聨會之重視、昨日午前、愛文諾會晤外次艾登、午間在下院宴會完畢之後、又與外相西門談話、其内容如何、一般人諱莫如深、但此項談話、係屬初步性質、英國政府似欲要求意相墨索里尼向國聨會提出明白具體之改組建議案云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聨秘書長愛文諾今晨與西門外相再度會晤、有所磋商、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨日下議院外交委員會非正式集會、請國聨會秘書長愛文諾演講之後、軍縮會議主席漢德森曾繼起演説、外間對漢氏演詞、紛紛評論、巴黎（巴報）駐倫敦記者對漢氏演詞、有精確報告、該記者謂、集會之筆錄、渠未嘗寓目、第據當時在場之下院議員言、漢德森似曾對法國歷任内閣在日内瓦所採之政策、加以攻擊、並謂法國内閣之時時動摇爲軍縮會議失敗之主要原因之一、漢氏似又謂渠早已與德國前總理白魯寗意見接近、若能依渠之意、則自若干時以來必已與德國妥恊矣、漢氏甚至謂、從前德國加入國聨會之時、各國曾正式允許日後對於軍備限制條欵有讓退之可能、然此種諾言各國今至拒絶履行、漢氏似又謂德國國社黨之得入主政權、毫不足怪、（每日驛郵報）相信漢德森之宣言、發生極大印象、恐此事下議院不免提出討論云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德向法要求　交還薩爾擴增陸軍</h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透社探悉、駐法英大使竇納與英閣員在過去數日中之談話、集中於德國對於軍縮之態度、及德總理希特勒對駐德法大使龐賽而發之建議、查希氏建議對法談判、將薩爾流域交還德國、不必付至一九三五年之公民表决、同時德國要求得置陸軍三十萬人、但僅可有九個月至十二個月之訓練、德國並得置國防戰具、但僅可逐漸設備、據路透社巴黎電云、此種建議似未能爲法德間擴大其軍縮談話之根據、法外部不認希氏曾作切實性質之建議、聞希氏之提議、决不爲法國所重視、且非法國單獨所可爲者、法國已明白表示不能討論或成立關於薩爾問題之恊定、因此事須留待國聨解决之也、巴黎人士多信德國重置軍備、現已達到希氏所提議之程度此即德國堅决拒絶檢查或監管軍備之一原因云、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>毒藥私售美大陸　來源出自日本　國聨限制製造公約　日本將附保留批准</h3>
<p>▲華盛頓訊、聨邦廠醉藥買賣取締局長安休氏、最近以其事務年報提出於政府公布、其中明白聲言侵蝕美國國民生活之麻醉藥私售之根據地在日本謂近來日本商人盛以内服麻醉藥售入美大陸方面、美國及坎拿大政府俱感威脅、在美國太平洋沿岸州及夏威夷、嗎啡私運尤盛、純係由日人之手配運各地、再由各地日商售給各户、最近太平洋沿岸州没收之嗎啡、殆均由日本用直接船私運而來者云、（世界社）</p>
<p>（東京）關於製造麻醉藥品及其分配限制取締之條約處理、應受國聨監督之件、此次由樞密院審查委員會討論之結果、謂日本雖已脱離國聨、伹爲確保將來之權利起見、對於施行本條約之必要機關仍得參加聲明保留批准、已經决議日本政府對於此種須受國聨拘束之國際條約、倘遇奏請批准之際、對於麻藥條約之處理、亦須聲明應付保留、奏請批准、以便確保將來之權利云、（十二日日聨社電）</p>

<h3>計畫改善日滿間交通</h3>
<p>（東京）海軍因第二次補充計畫完成後、滿洲之豐富物産、須補給於日本、故完成日本海之交通路、爲對付一九三六年危機之重要凖備、因此現在研究中、該交通路爲開發敦賀·伏木·新瀉及津輕海峽、俾與羅津·長春·相聨絡、緣新瀉爲滿洲與日本聨絡之最短路線、新瀉長春間所需時間爲三十九小時、較經下關者縮短九小時、經敦賀者短七小時經伏木者縮五小時、又伏木之土地宜於建築工廠、故滿洲物産能迅速運抵、即在該地製造後分運日本、至設有軍需工廠之敦賀、因控關西貿易地之背、貿易大可發展又津輕海峽爲由美至華各地經過之航路、將來確有發展希望、因此新設一港於津輕海峽、作爲由太平洋入日本海之關門港、係最緊要之事云、又與路並行、必須新路航空路、因現經朝鮮之航空路、須在中途過夜、殊屬不便、若由新瀉經過、則東京長春間僅需十小時即可達到、故於國防上經濟上、該改善日本海之交通路、洵屬必要者也、（十二日電通電）</p>

<h3>太平洋代管島　日本抱永久佔有决心　縱國聨懦弱不予收回　美國未必能默爾而息</h3>

<p>昨日午後、記者從某西人處、叩詢確忠、當蒙告以確訊、謂亞列佛倍恩克輪、昨晨可到滬、刻爲霧阻、須改遲五日、十七日准可到滬、但船内所裝八千九百餘噸美麥業已售與客家、不必卸存棧房、星期日一到上海、即可從船邊交貨、刻已咨照受主、速備駁船、以便届時過卸云、</p>
<h3>陸續運來</h3>
<p>二三批美麥亦已交由史丹士公司派兩船、共裝一萬六千噸、亞列根號運八千噸、於本月二十三日進口、愛亞淮輪裝八千噸、下月十三日可到、第四第五兩批、亦經在美配定兩船、一裝六千噸、一載五千八百噸、統於本星期六開出、准下月十號左右到上海、綜計前後五批、共三萬六千七百四十噸、合諸總數、計四十萬包、其餘四船、悉上華棧、</p>
<h3>運貨赴美</h3>
<p>此次運麥租船、由招商局直接向洋商輪公司訂定租價極廉、每噸不到美金兩元、第一輪亞列佛倍恩克至滬卸貨後、在滬帶裝出口貨赴美、其儎脚、已經招商局攬配齊備、專候裝船運往矣、招商局兼營國外航業、此尚爲始創、不可不有以記之也、</p>
<h3>中英通報月内决定</h3>
<p>至中英正式通報日期、據該台宣稱、所裝之發報機及收音機、雖已完竣、但接線較正等手續、頗爲繁冗、日來、工程師正將所須電力、逐步貫通各新機、一面試騐所裝機件、有無錯誤、一面並校正音符、是否清晰、故中英通報期、須視各新機校正完畢後、方克决定、預料本月底或明年一月初、即可正式通報</p>
<h3>開徴　洋米麥進口税</h3>
<p>財部定十六日實行關於財部開徴洋米麥曁加徴洋麵粉進口關税、决提前於本月十六日起開徴業已分别訓令海關税務署海關監督公署、轉飭遵照税率標凖、均定明日（十四日）正式公布、至報載開徴傾銷税、係屬訛傳、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>海關奉令實行</h3>
<p>海關總税務署、海關監督公署、於本月十日接奉財政部開徴洋米麥麵粉進口關税之訓令後、即分别轉飭各地江海關查照、税率辦法標凖原可早日公布、因恐發生漏税流弊關係暫時嚴守秘密、故外間均認起徴日期、定爲明年元旦、大公社記者連日向可靠方面探詢、已證實該項洋米麥等進口關税、决提前於本月十六日起實行開徴、詳細之税率辦法、明日（十四日）即正式公布云、</p>
<h3>税率標準内容</h3>
<p>洋米洋麥過去均未徴税、惟洋麵粉原有每百斤徴○二五、（即二角五分金單位）故此次財政部徴進口關税之類别、計分兩種甲、洋米來定爲增税、乙、洋麵粉定爲加税、茲探得税率標凖、内容如下（一）洋米（舊制一百斤合關衡六○五）徴税一元、（以金單位計算）（二）洋麥（舊制一百斤合關衡六○五）徴税○三○、（即金單位三角）（三）洋麵粉（舊制一百斤合關衡六○五）徴税○七五、（即金單位七角五分、）</p>
<h3>麵粉商之損失</h3>
<p>本市阜豐·申大·福新·生大·信大·等各麵粉廠商、除向中央銀行美棉麥事務處、訂購首批美麥計八船外、復直接向支加哥·坎拿大·澳洲·阿根廷·等處、續購洋麥計十一船、因悉徴税期定明年一月一日實行、該貨均約定本年底運滬交貨、但財部提前實行、開徴洋米麥麵粉税收後、損失殊爲不貲、據大公社記者向各行探詢結果、承購八船美麥、由政府自行保税外、廠商直接訂購之十一船洋麥、每船均在七千五百噸以上、進口關税損失達七十七萬餘元云、</p>

<h3>三北公司萬象輪　在武穴上游肇鉅禍　＝黑夜中撞沉兵差小輪一艘＝　＝有六十餘人不及援救溺斃＝</h3>
<p>－當場救起者亦有六十餘人－三北公司萬象輪、此次自福州還滬、改行長江、駛至武穴上游沂州地方、因天氣有霧、在江内撞沉小輪一艘、溺斃六十餘人、亟將詳情、查誌如下、</p>
<h3>萬象改航長江</h3>
<p>三北公司之萬象輪、本行駛上海福州、自閩變後、遵照蔣委員長電令、停止滬閩班、改航長江、惟是海輪行走揚子江、船主在航路方面、自不甚熟悉、該公司於萬象改航之時、卽以清浦輪船主翁紀清調充萬象船主、以翁於長江一路較爲熟悉也、萬不料行至武穴上游、突肇此空前慘禍、</p>
<h3>昨晨釀成慘禍</h3>
<p>此次萬象上水沿途所運貨客甚多、在經過之鎭寗·蕪·皖·九江·各地、均皆停靠卸貨、迨至十日、從潯埠卸上旅客貨件後、便啟椗赴漢、至昨日（十二號）晨四時二十分、船至武穴以上、沂州之下、其時天氣未明、而江面有霧、萬象開航上駛、詎在此黑夜霧露中、對方有一小輪駛來、萬象未見、致突然相撞、該小輪竟被撞斷、立刻沉没江中、全船之人、盡行落水、</p>
<h3>溺斃六十餘命</h3>
<p>萬象在肇禍後、立卽停車、全體船員、均同時進行打撈工作、當放舢舨下水、分頭撈救、經二三時之久、共救起六十餘人、卽載上萬象本船、當時因黑夜不分、未知沉没者何船、嗣後經船主向救起之人詢問、始悉被撞沉者係由漢口下水之軍差小火輪、船内載有武裝同志及服務人員一百數十人、係往九江者、不意爲萬象攔腰相撞二三分鐘、便卽沉失、致不及救護而遭溺斃之人、至少在六十名以上、</p>
<h3>事後船赴漢口</h3>
<p>慘案發生後、萬象輪已發電至上海與漢口兩地、報告肇事狀况、一面則載救起之六十餘人、除臨時在船内設法給以衣服換着外、便帶往漢口、昨日下午、萬象已抵漢口、其餘溺斃在江才、漢口三北公司已派輪到沂州上游肇事地點一帶、進行打撈以便備棺收殮、</p>
<h3>滬局將到電告</h3>
<p>昨日午後、三北公司接得萬象船主自漢口發來電告、略稱、萬象輪於今晨（十二日）四時二十分在沂州下游、撞沉兵差小輪一艘、該小輪立旣沉没、船内裝有兵士等共一百餘人、當塲救起六十餘人、至六時起、始開往漢口云云、滬局得此警報、除電漢澈究肇事眞相、並命漢分局派船打撈屍體外、再議善後辦法、</p>
<h3>進行善後辦法</h3>
<p>此次萬象撞沉者爲兵差小輪、而死亡者多爲服務之人、日溺斃至六七十名之多、而小輪船身已全毁没於江底、對於此項遭難者是否須負擔撫卹、現在尚無所聞、須俟對方交涉後、始定辦法、而翁紀清在清浦船長任内、上月使該輪擱淺於荻港、迄未救出、公司方面損失已逾十萬元、今又撞沉小輪溺死數十人、其禍更爲慘大、故該公司當局對之、頗爲不滿、詳情容再續誌、</p>
<h3>英使臨别恤囚　哈特萊夫人免死</h3>

<p>隆藏洋行向營進出口貨物、中間尤以羊毛絲紗爲大宗、其堆棧設在廣東路七號、計有前後兩幢棧屋、一憑愛多亞路四川路、一憑廣東路、同時棧房進出口、亦在廣東路、去年間、其後幢堆棧、曾不戒於火、突肇焚如、内部堆物、盡付一炬、損失不貲、詎昨晚十時三十分許、其前幢堆棧三層樓上、又忽起火、及附近崗捕瞥見、通知捕房、轉知救火會、趕派救火車前往、已成不可收拾之勢、同時火勢更烈、自二層以至第五層、悉成火窟、各救火員乃設法進内、打開窗户、始得將水灌進、同時升架雲梯、由高下射、詎中有第三零一號救火員名小龍者、因奮勇升梯、不愼失足、竟由高跌下、以致重傷、當場由救護車送往巡捕醫院救治、性命甚危、其他各救火員仍極力施救、無奈火勢極大此熄彼起、因此施救許久、未曾稍殺、直至十二時許、勢始漸衰、得免蔓延、但白烟瀰漫、有如大霧、故完全撲滅、恐今晨尚難實現、至於損失一項、據云以羊毛絲件爲大宗、爲數鉅萬、</p>

<h3>人壽保險與國家經濟的發展</h3>
<p>— 張似旭</p>
<p>人壽保險最初的目的，是爲奬勵個人節儉，保障家屬的生活及子女的教育。簡言之，人壽保險是鞏固個人經濟，發展個人經濟，以至擴大到家庭經濟集團的幸福的方法。在個人方面觀察，投資於人壽保險，不過是有意地或隨意地把零星欵項，逐漸積　起來，至相當期限，或約定事故發生時，收到預定的整數，以供一定目的的使用。從家庭方面觀察，一家之中，除家長以外，大都爲不生産者，單靠家長的生産力，以維持全家人員的生活，教育，娛樂。家長的生死存亡，就是他們底幸福的關鍵，家長的生死存亡，世間没有可以担保之人，他們的幸福，也就飄摇不定地操在命運之神之手，他們是無力反抗的。惟有人壽保險替他們戰勝了命運之神，打破了没有一定的生死之謎，確立了幸福的凱旋門。家長保丁相當的壽險金額，他們——祖父母父母妻子兒女等——不必憂慮將來的衣食住行育樂。他們不但是血統的集團，也成了經濟鞏固的經濟集團。祇是，血統的集團，缺乏經濟力量的連鎖，是容易散失衰敗的。加上了經濟的屏障，才無崩潰之虞，所以人壽保險之在他們的立塲上，是萬萬不可缺少的生活要件。</p>
<p>人壽保險本身最終的目的是爲家庭，家庭是由個人而集合·國家則爲家庭所組成，所以無論家庭之組織爲大爲小，均爲國家的基礎。個人的經濟，影響家庭。家庭的經濟，影響國家。歐美各國固然盛行小家庭制度，但妻子兒女的生活教養，還靠丈夫兼父親的一家之主。中國的國家組織，數千年來向以家庭爲單位，個人的奮鬭努力，爲了（增光門楣），家庭的繁榮盛，（家中人）都沾了（雨露）；是以齊家治國，同爲人生莫大的的責任。到了今日，雖倡言小家庭，而小家庭以外的親戚們底生活與教育，還要主持小家庭者去恊力維持。一個家長的不幸的死亡，便是全家人口的飢寒，貧困，痛苦，即爲全國經濟上增加一重負担，國家的經濟的發展上，加一極大的障礙。</p>
<p>我們所見的孤兒院貧兒院，是誰製造出來的？還不是自私自利生前不顧身後兒女幸福的一班父親嗎？清節堂，老人堂，救濟會，游民習藝所等等是爲着誰設立的？也莫不是不顧妻子幸福，少壯不肯積儲，不爲兒女設備教育經費的結果嗎？這種種慈善機關的經費是由誰募集的？是否出之地方上的税收，與衆人的負担？地方上的税收就是政府的收入，本可以爲積極建設事業如公共衛生，教育交通娛樂等等用的，現在却祗好供消極的防腐的耗費了。（未完）</p>
<h3>對於先施人壽保險公司内容之探討</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>先施人壽保險公司，就是先施百貨公司的副産物，欲知先施人壽保險公司的情形，總要先知先施百貨公司的歷史和組織，查先施百貨公司爲國内百貨公司之鼻祖，由三十年前自澳洲歸國僑胞馬應彪君等手創，原始股本僅二萬五千元，規模簡陋，特以勇敢發奮，百折不撓之精神，經之營之，逐年增加資本，由二萬五千元，而二十萬元，而三百萬元，而七百萬元，迄今已達一千萬元之鉅，資本愈雄厚，而幹事人員之精神愈勇敢發奮，復以振興實業維持民生國計爲職志，先後成立先施化妝品公司，水火保險公司，人壽保險公司，併百貨商塲而爲四大公司，綜計資本總額達一千四百五十萬元，（人壽保險資本二百萬元）股東數萬人，皆屬殷實華商，故先施人壽保險公司成立之始，即以其股東爲基本之保户。</p>
<p>查先施人壽保險公司，創辦迄茲，已經十稔，保户逾萬，保額將及千萬，至屬難能，凡人壽保險公司之艱難時期，即在於初届十年，良以開業之始，費用浩繁，賠欵率高，所收保費稀少，往往不足以資應付，現該公司初届十年，安然渡過，且　有良好之成績，因其組織完善，基礎穏回，有先施百貨公司爲後盾，有水火保險公司化妝品公司爲左右翼，聨成一氣相輔進行，是以信用集中，各界踴躍歸附，營業前程，有閎遠之期望，此後對於培植國民經濟計劃，必更有相當的貢獻，可預期也。</p>
<p>人壽保險公司所能取信於社會者，固以資本雄厚，辦理合法爲前題，而監察收支賬目，以昭核實，亦極重要，尤其是人材優異，科學管理，先施人壽保</p>
<h3>人壽保險專刊中華人壽保險恊進社主編（第十期）</h3>
<p>吾人大半均賴曰常收入叺爲生苟一旦身遭不測妻孥即失所依賴欲謀捄濟　惟人壽保險人壽保險者非保吾人可叺長生而不死乃賠償其目身故所受經濟上之損失也馬寅初險公司，因總行設立香港，故在香港政府註册，（另在國民政府實業部登記）香港政府，對於賬目臣察甚嚴，一切收支數目，核算翔實，絶無苟且情事，尤爲優點）</p>
<p>人壽保險，非短期儲蓄可比，該公司旣有悠久之歷史，雄厚之資本，優異之人材，嚴格之監察，且屬純粹華商所組織，故本社特爲介紹，使國人認識先施人壽保險公司的旗幟。古卓崙君，中山縣人，廣東省立高等文科專門學校畢業，後入國立北京大學習經濟科，三十五歲以前，從事政治生活，旋因政局不定，投身商界，服務於國民銀行天津分行，及先施水火保險公司總行。民國十八年，授職上海先施人壽保險公司司理，任内能以其學識經騐，多所規劃，故該公司之壽險業務日益發達，</p>
<h3>何謂險？</h3>
<p>— 古卓崙</p>
<p>就壽險之範圍，説明危險之定義，與一般之認識，略有不同，壽險之險是附有一定之條件，是具有法律之含義，其條件如何，其含義安在，分别説明如下。</p>
<p>（一）事態發生不是預知的凡事在意料之中者，可以預知，身有不治之症即預知之險也，抽刀自殺亦預知之險也，前者則保而不受，後者則受而不賠，若夫因病魔之侵襲，舟車之傾覆，火水之爲災，盜賊仇人之加害，偶然喪失生命者，乃爲莫可逆肊之事態，此之謂壽險之險。</p>
<p>（二）事態發生須要合法的何謂合法，合乎國家法令之謂也，國家法令所以規定吾人行爲之責任，行爲而違法則國家制裁之，殺之放火，爲非作列，因犯罪而捐軀，或被囚而喪命者，此爲被保人違法行爲之結果，保險人當然不負其責任，又有急謀取得保險金額之惡念，加害於被保人之生命者，亦爲不合法之危險也。</p>
<p>（三）事態發生不是同時的保險之根本觀念在於以經濟之損失，轉嫁於多數之人而使其平均負担之，若同一期間被保各户多數遇險，如洪水汜濫，如大地震撼，死亡人數盈野盈城，苟執契約而履行之，則不獨賠不勝賠，抑亦賠無可賠，此種事態法律雖無明文之規定，然與保險之根本觀念相違矣。</p>
<p>（四）危險程度要可以估量的估量云者，以統計方法測定其危險程度之謂，有以年歲爲估量之標準者，有以體格爲估量之標準者，設如二十歲級之人每千人每年死亡若干，三十歲或四十歲級之人每年每千人死亡若干，有死亡統計表可以核按而知，此乃以年歲估量危險之程度也，又如經醫員之檢騐，因其身體之　弱而定爲次健，或增加其保費，或縮短其保期，種種方法，不一而足，此乃以體格估量危險之程度也，若被保人對於保險公司之詢問而爲虚僞之陳述，或短報年齡超過其保險年齡表之外，或以詐術隠瞞醫員，使其失却檢騐之效能，此皆足以令保險人方面無從估量其危險之程度，一旦事故發生，保險人無負責之必要。</p>
<p>（五）保險範圍須有一定的以手足爲保險之範圍者，保險人之責任祗限於手足，不傷手足雖喪生命者不與也，以意外爲保險之範圍者，保險人之責任祗限於意外，因疾病而壽終正寢者不與也，故保險契約必載明其危險之性質與種類，其種類如何則聽當事之自擇，遇險而非其類保險人對之自無責任之可言也。</p>
<h3>人壽保險恊進社擴大會議</h3>
<p>— 記凡</p>

<h3>自作聰明</h3>
<p>— 忻忻</p>
<p>眞的愚笨的人並不可笑，可恨，而可笑，可恨的却是並不聰明的人强作解人，自己以爲了不得；而所幹的事却是一團糟。因爲，覺得自己愚笨的人，决不會胆大妄爲，盲人騎瞎馬似的亂衝亂撞，他自知之明，覺到自己才力不如人，於是肯脚踏實地的埋頭苦幹；别人的忠告，肯虚心接受；别人所不願做，不肯做的事，他肯做願做；終於，他的成功超過了自命爲一天才者。對於這樣的人，我們不僅不該笑他，恨他，我們並且該向他表示欽佩而加以效法。</p>
<p>至於自作聰明者怎樣呢？他祇懂得了一些皮毛，——不，有的連皮毛都不懂，他僅是拾了别人一些牙慧——便自命爲什麽家），這，對於不懂這一類學識的當然是刮目相看，以爲是了不起的（家），同時對這紙糊老虎的勾當，一時也不容易戳穿；至於懂得這一類學識的呢，覺得可笑，可憐。</p>
<p>他的結果如何呢？因爲這隻紙糊老虎没人去戳穿他——這原因，不懂得的，蒙在鼓裏，懂得的，不屑爲——於是連自己都疑惑起來，以爲自己眞的成了（家）了，於是横行一時，自以爲不可一世，連眞止的（家）的面前都班門弄斧起來了。再後如何呢？忘記了自己的尾巴還没有藏好——不，卽使要藏好也無從藏起的，因爲有尾巴終究是有尾巴，而狐狸也决不會變成眞的人形，在顯微鏡下，無可逃避的顯出了原形。——而卽目空一切，别人以前因爲覺得可笑可憐，而不屑加以揭穿，這時已進至可恨到了頂點，覺得再不戳穿，未免要顚倒黑白了，於是便免不得麻煩一下子。</p>
<p>可是，話雖這麽説，自作聰明者在中國却還是日益加多起來。原因。這麽一個混亂的年頭，這麽一個混亂的社會，眞理給扔到垃圾桶裏，一切都是投機者在操縱，這樣的來一下，原是露頭角的終南捷徑，雖然明知道紙糊老虎終有給戳穿的一日，而那時已名至利歸，還（管他娘）的。</p>
<p>於是，在中國；什麽（家）兼什麽（家）的，名人，天才便在在皆是了，一個人可以兼職十個，廿個以上。</p>
<p>當然，他們也明知道埋頭苦幹才是對的，可是他們覺得這終究有些（儍），似非聰明人所爲！</p>
<p>可是，時代是向前推的，眞理也决不會永遠扔在垃圾桶裏，狐狸的尾巴，或許明天就無可逃遁的顯現出來！這，我堅决相信，你當然也相信。</p>
<h3>微言</h3>
<p>— 琢</p>
<p>大家庭猶如一艘大輪船，小家庭猶之一艘汽油船，處在某種環境中纔能表現出它的特點來。</p>
<p>駡人是美德，並未缺德。祗須言正詞嚴，就算（駡得好）！</p>
<p>從小姑娘變做小婦人這一時期，作風大有轉變！一個尖嘴姑娘往往很容易變成一個和氣靄靄的教堂裏女神父模樣，當然，信不信由你。</p>
<p>貴國人絶對信仰（天老爺），吃飯要靠天，説話呌談天，一切都離不掉老天。所以大家對國事，對人事，均漠然視之！因爲（天有眼睛），天理照彰果報不爽的，吃虧些也就算了，天無絶人之路啊。</p>
<p>人説每天大笑三次，有補身心；我想每天能夠大哭三次，也未必無益？可惜哭笑都不能勉强，生活在這世界上的人，眞有哭笑不得之　了！</p>
<h3>走</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>（走）是多方面的，也是人類最偉大的工作。若非（不絶的向前走），便不能由穴居野處而到高堂大厦，由茹毛飲血而到割鮮烹肥，由不識不知而到科學萬能的時代了。</p>
<p>社會愈文明，走的方式也愈多。近來報上，常常見到許多新發明的走法。雖然他所走的路，有（邪）的，有（曲）的，有（分歧）的，（黑暗）的。然而不能否認他不在（走）。不過他的歸宿點，不是（黄浦江），便是（大旅館，）走到人生最後之路的（死）上去罷了。（死路一條）雖然不很寫意；但我們還是要承認他們是在努力的走。因爲（死路）也是路，而且是人人必經之路，不過他們早些休息罷了。</p>
<p>走死路的人旣然如許之我，這一筆招尋的廣告費，當然非常可觀。在這金錢艱難的時候，應當想一個緊縮的方法才是。所以我代登報的人，擬了一個（活絡廣告。）無論是捲逃私奔，挾欵走避，反對家庭……等等，都可適用。式如下</p>
<p>（ＸＸ鑒自爾出走，合家驚惶○啼○哭，○○憂急成病，務望即刻歸家○○均可商量○○决不追究或通信○○以慰懸望</p>
<p>ＸＸ白</p>
<p>照上式，祗要在畫圈的地方，塡上幾個字，便可適用。譬如（招尋逃妻）的，那麽很容易就成功一紙合格的廣告。　　（……兒啼女哭……余亦憂急成病……一切均可商量……往事决不追究……）</p>
<p>附帶聲明；這（活絡尋人廣告），雖是我發明的，可並不專利。儘請放心套用，决不會打律墨官司的。</p>
<h3>狗肉</h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>朔風一次吹到廣州，應時的（菓子狸）（龍虎鬥）（五蛇大會）便出現於市面上。這種名聞中外的食品，因爲是其，一壁嚼着熟肉，除了黄狗的吠聲有點兒令人難過之外，大槪也不亞於（菓子狸）（龍虎鬥）（五蛇大會）等的狸肉，猫肉，蛇肉的哩！</p>
<p>他的地方所没有的，我們也可以稱它爲（特殊的）食品。　　這種（特殊的）食品，廣州方面的大闊佬們是以它爲冬天的無上補品的：但也因爲它的價錢太昻貴。有許多人便無力去嘗試它。因此，價廉物美的狗肉，便成爲平民化的冬天補品了。</p>
<p>但是，不知爲了什麽原故，衛生局却要指狗肉爲不合衛生的食物，不准售賣，於是嗜好此道的便不憚麻煩，跑了許多路程到市區外邊的村莊上去。</p>
<p>在村莊那兒，狹隘的街道上，有許多掛着滿架狗肉的鋪子。鋪子裏面，在低矮的屋頂下，擺着四五隻高不及二尺的桌子，許多張竹椅子。桌子的中央便擺着火爐、瓦罅。</p>
<p>當我們踏進舖子裏去時，第一聞到的是一股蠻香的異味，第二便是裝在鐵欄裏等着開刀的黄狗的吠聲。</p>
<p>但是，終於是異味戰勝了吠聲，人的惻隠之心失掉了，而開始忍心地把狗肉切成方塊，放在箕裏。當狗肉還未倒下瓦罅之前，舖子裏的人拿柴來燒了滿爐的火，瓦罅放在上面，預備好了的紅糖，大蒜，生薑，猪油等便倒下罅裏煑着。約莫過了五分鐘的樣子，狗肉也就從箕裏倒到罅裏去。一聲吱喳，香已開始在四周飛着。</p>
<p>三幾個人圍着這罅狗肉，一邊談笑，一邊便加了些現成的狗羹下去。把蓋子蓋了起來，大家等着這狗肉快快煑熟。　　但是要過了三十分鐘的樣子，蓋子才開始跳躍着了。揭開瓦蓋，面前便是煑得爛熟的奇香的狗肉了：一壁呷着醇酒</p>

<p>趙翁對於兒子的婚事，也許比兒子自身還急，他總想把兒媳婦娶到家了，可以有幾種好處，第一婚事不會變卦，第二，趙楊二家，可以實行合作。第三，可以早早的得着抱孫子的機會了。只是偷看他母女的態度，總有些愁眉苦臉的，兒子又遠在喜峯口防地裏，萬一和江氏開了口，兒子却回來不了，失信於人，更加增一層罪過。反過來寫信告訴兒子，讓他請假回來，若是楊家母女不願，也是讓兒子下不了台的事。所以在心裏儘管是願意，口裏却是没有法子把這層意思表示出來。現在江氏自動的提議了，這只要自己寫信去呌兒子就行，乃是單獨的應付一方面的事，這就好辦得多了。他總是那樣，坐在一張墊了舊袴子的藤椅上，口啣了旱烟袋，吸一口，噴一口，表示着他沉思待答的神氣，這次江氏坐在他對面椅子上，提到了這個問題的時候，他的手一拍，忽然站了起來，甩着他那蒼老的嗓子笑道：這就好極了。他這句好極了，脱口而出，那根二尺長的旱烟袋，也就脱口而出，卜篤一下響，落在地上，他這管旱烟袋，是個燒料咀子，這樣的猛跌下去，就砸了一個粉碎，這位老人没有伴侶旱烟袋就是他唯一的伴侶，把烟袋咀子砸了，這也無異打傷了他的伴侶，由江氏看來，這可是一件不幸的事情。但是趙翁對於這個，却一點也不注意，只隨便的將旱烟袋放在茶几上，依然向江氏道：大嫂，我們的意思，不都是一樣嗎？兒子婚事，總望他早早的了結，做父母的趁此也就可以了却一種心願了。你説罷，要怎樣辦喜事，我進就來記上。（二六六）</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>天字號中</h3>
<p>— 組琳</p>
<p>滿嵌着鐵條的小窗，向外一望，可以知道天已亮了，若將臉貼近些窗口，一定覺得空氣是尖刻的。</p>
<p>如此激人的早上的寒風，吹醒了天字號中　着鐵器的兩個人，他們剛從夢中驚醒，身上感覺冷得發抖，磕睡還没有離兩，不由得使他們伸着懶腰，除了還有兩個人的鼾聲，這號中的空氣是暫時的靜默。</p>
<p>兩個人的視線，忽然碰在一起，互相的苦矣了一聲，於是就開始作今天第一次的談話。</p>
<p>－媽的－好不受用，阿四哥你睡得熟嗎？</p>
<p>－唔！怪冷氣的，這可把老子凍死了。</p>
<p>算是被褥；也可以説是大衣的麻袋移動了，隨時起了一次鐵器的共鳴。</p>
<p>易老五覺得褲襠裏的東西起了變化，似乎有了要小解的徴象，他就憤的扒起，於是使他的笨重的脚鐐丁當丁當的響着。</p>
<p>他蹲在有幾個顯明漏孔的木桶上，撤了一泡尿，同時一陣臭的臊氣沸揚起來，一間只能躺着四個人的位置的號了，在門首的左角，還要放一個臊臭得使人嘔個不住的馬桶，稻草滿堆着地面，濕氣不時的從草下透出，和了人們的體臭，混成一種説不出的氣味，在前夜，他們是很嗅不慣，而到了這裏，不受用也要受用了</p>
<p>此時阿四哥已將　轉過去，另外的兩個人還未醒來，易老五回身見了亮光，不覺嘆了一口氣，慢慢的躺下，將麻袋放在身上，覺得頭是昏昏的。</p>
<p>白花花的洋鈿，好像在他的腿前閃着，過去的事情，不由得重在他腦間浮現起來。</p>
<p>小野鷄的膀臂，恰像嫩藕般的白，可不説呢！咱老子就是遭在那白膀子上呢！正在享享樂兒，忽然來了幾個丘八，還有一個小孩子，媽的！他們説咱老子是土匪，鐵練套在頸間，不由你分説的帶着就走。才幾天的事，就給他們察覺！幹嗎！那小傢伙怎麽没有死，定是他走了風。</p>
<p>好容易奔了數年，在江湖上才稍有了點聲名。還是當了一次班長，才撈了幾條火，這幾年在四湖這條河上不知做了多少的案子，咱老子們大塊吃肉，大秤分金，没有一回走過風，這次合該是有事，不把船中的羊兒們淹死，也不會弄出道大的事來。</p>
<p>做事的第二天，在茶館裏就聽有人在講那件事，媽的！什麽胡福，還是個學生呢！啊！起着了，那個穿青布長袍的小夥子，不是什麽胡福嗎！那時咱老子可不講情呢！管你學生是學死，咱老子們要的是錢，就是你家裏有十個老婆，若撩了咱老子的火起，要幹還是要幹的，殺幾個人不算回什麽。而這一次並不肥，一共有只兩百多塊錢，媽的！還使咱老子們受苦，眞糟糕！他杨到這裏，不覺心中像一有股無名的火在燃燒，同時那兩個人已經起了身，鐵鐐丁當得比前更響，感成一種音樂的懺悔，立刻斷了他的追思，而身體覺得痛了起來。</p>
<p>陽光由窗口射入，滿照着易老五的面孔，此時他很不願去廻想他史的罪惡。阿四哥正在短衫上剿匪，那兩個已談講得很有勁，不一會，小兵送進飯來，一鉢死黄色的小菜；和糙而且生的米飯，擱在草上，他們每人得了一大碗，因着饑餓的壓迫，使他們不得不去吃。</p>
<p>大陽的熱度照耀着他們的早餐，好像是向他們獰笑。</p>

<h3>批評家辨</h3>
<p>— 履霜</p>
<p>現在一説到（批評家），人們的想像中就浮現出一副冷酷的面孔，——縐緊的眉毛，（炯炯如電）的目光，不容情的嘴巴；而且，（大筆如椽），這也不好，那也不正確，第三個又是不充，總之是指斥多而讚許少。</p>
<p>這自然是（幻覺）。批評家並不是腦筋構造與别人不同，專愛從（豆腐裏揀骨頭）的，並不是一定要把好的都説成了壞；批評家不過是（天職所在），不能委蛇從俗罷了。一個眞眞負責的批評家假使不得不指斥多於讚許的時候，他的心一定是苦的，因爲他的愉快乃在得佳作而讀之，而推荐之，决不是在駡倒了一切。</p>
<p>世上也有什麽都看不入眼的（批評家）；他駡（小市民），因爲他們太俗，他也不滿意於追求一個理想鍥而不舍的人們，以爲他們太空想。這樣的批評家就是所謂（虚無主義）的批評家。西洋文藝史上就有不少這一類的批評家，但他們也不是眞能（虚無），批倒一切，他們對於虚無主義的作品也還是讚賞。</p>
<p>記得有一個故事，説戲台上在做曹操的戲，有樵夫見曹操者出塲，怒不可遏，跳上戲台，以斧殺之。西洋中世紀也有個相仿的故事：殺人者是農民，而被殺者則扮演了那個出賣耶穌的猶大。曹操與猶大雖可殺，然而那位樵夫或農民物認爲作者現身説法，把書中人物的思想認爲都是作者的思想，於是（斧鉞之誅）直欲加之作者身上了。</p>
<p>在紛亂的社會裏，前一型的批評家常得最（澈底）的頭銜，而後一型的批評家常得最（勇敢）的稱號。（澈底）與（勇敢）者多，而批評家遂被一般人誤會爲冷酷可怕，專在吹毛求疵的（批病）家了，這不是偶然的呵！</p>
<h3>仙霞紀險</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>從衢州南下，一路上迎送着的有不斷的青山，更超過幾條水色藍碧的江身，經一大平原，過雙塔地，到一區四山圍抱的江城，就是江山縣了。</p>
<p>江山是以三片石的江郎山出名的地方，南越仙霞關，直通閩粤，西去玉山，便是江西；所謂七省通衢，江山實在是第一個緊要的邊境。世亂年荒，這江山縣人民的提心吊膽，打草驚蛇的狀况，也可以想見的了，我們南來，也不過想見識見識仙霞關的險峻，至於採風訪俗，玩水遊山，在這一個年頭，却是不許輕易去嘗試的雅事，所以到江山的第二日一日，我們就亟亟地雇了一輛汽車，馳往仙霞關去。</p>
<p>在南門外的汽車站上車，三里就到俗名東嶽山，有一塊老虎岩，并一座明嘉靖年間建置的塔在的景星山下；南行二十里，遥遥望得見衝天的三塊巨巖江郎山，或合或離，在東面的羣山中跳躍；再去是淤頭，是峽口，是仙霞嶺的區域了，去江山雖有八九十里路程，但汽車走走，也只走了兩三個鐘頭的樣子。</p>
<p>仙霞嶺的面貌，實在是雄奇偉大得很－老遠看來，就是那麽高那麽大的這排百里來長的仙霞仙脈，近來一看，更覺得是不見天日了。東西南的三面，灣裏有灣，山上有山：奇峯怪石，老樹長藤，不計其數；而最曲折不盡，令人方向都分辨不出來的，是新從關外二十八都築起，沿龍溪化龍溪兩支深山中的大水而行的那條通江山的汽車公路。</p>
<p>五步一轉灣，三步一上嶺，一面是流泉渦旋的深坑萬丈，一面又是鳥飛不到的絶壁千層。轉一個灣，變一番景色，上一條嶺，闢一個天地，上上下下，去去回回，我們在仙霞山中，龍溪岸上，自北去南，因爲要繞過仙霞關去，汽車足足走了有一個多鐘頭的山路。山的高，水的深，與夫灣的多，路的險，不折不扣的説將出來，比杭州的九溪十八澗，起碼總要超過三百多倍。要看山水的曲折，要試車路的崎嶇，要將性命和運命去拚拚，想嘗一嘗生死關頭，千鈞一髮的冒險異味的人，仙霞嶺不可不到，尤其是從仙霞關北麓繞路出關，上關南二十八都去的這一條新闢的汽車公路不可不去一走。車到闢南，行經小午嶺的那個隘口，近瞰二十八都谷的底裏人家，遠望浦城楓嶺諸峯的青影的時候，我眞感到了一種一則以喜一則一懼的説不出的心理，喜的是關後許多險隘，已經被我走過了，懼的是直望山脚的目的地二十八都，雖然是只離開了一程抛石的空間，但山坡陡削，直衝下去，總也還有二三千尺的高度。這時候回頭來看看仙霞關，一條石級鋪得像蛇腹似的曩時的鳥道，却早已高高隠没在雲霧與樹木的中間了。</p>
<p>從小午嶺的隘口下來，盤旋迴繞，再走了三四十分鐘頭，到仙霞關外第一口的二十八都去一看，忽然間大家的身上又起了一層雞皮的細粒。</p>
<p>太陽分明是高照在那裏，天色當然是蒼蒼的，高大的人家的住屋，也一層一層的排列着在，但是人哩，活的生動着的人哩，人都到那裏去了呢？</p>
<p>許許多多的很整齊的人家，窗户都是掩着的，門却是半開半閉，或者竟全無地空空洞洞同死鱸魚的口嘴似的張開在那裏。踏進去一看，地下只散亂舖着有許多稻草。脚步聲在空屋裏反射出來的那一種響聲，自己聽了也要害怕。忽而索落落屋角的黑暗處稻草一動，偶而也會立起一個人來，但只光着眼睛，向你上下一打量，他就悄悄的避開了。你若追上去問他一句話呢，他只很勉强地站立下來，對你又是光着眼睛的一番打量，摇摇頭，露一臉陰風慘慘的苦笑，就又走了，回話是一句也不説的。（未完）</p>
<h3>農家風光</h3>
<p>— 何德明</p>
<p>小癩痢儘在稻草堆上發怔。夕陽掉下西山腰了，牛在一聲聲地呌，他都全不理會。只有那一雙黑黑的眼睛，却像兩顆星似地，老在他眼前閃爍。</p>
<p>（阿巧，這小妮子！可眞夠味兒。）</p>
<p>他不自禁地溜出這一句，腦子清靜過來了，看看天要變暗，趕忙站起身，拿着鐮刀，牽着牛回家去。剛剛挨近籬笆，就碰見阿巧。</p>
<p>（小癩痢，回來哪！怎的這樣晚？）</p>
<p>一邊説着，一邊就笑。</p>
<p>（阿巧姊，…………）</p>
<p>小癩痢找不着話兒，儘對她釘眼兒。</p>
<p>（快進去吧，别又給阿牛哥看見，給打耳光啦。）</p>
<p>她還是一陣陣地笑。小癩痢一聽到她提起她的未婚夫阿牛哥，就滿不高興；狠狠地把阿巧瞪了一眼就進去了。</p>
<p>晚上，阿巧在廚房間燒菜。小癩痢在竈下很起勁地把一束束荳殻直往灶門裏扔，心裏眞有説不出的舒服，兩隻眼睛像餓狼樣，就儘朝阿巧臉上，身上，……自上至下，從右到左，溜轉，溜轉，</p>
<p>（壞傢伙！老看我做甚麽？我身上又没長花兒。）</p>
<p>阿巧舉起鐵鉗，嬌嗔地，想打小癩痢</p>
<p>（你不看我，那曉得我在看你呢？）</p>
<p>小癩痢一邊狡猾地笑，一邊從柴堆裏拾起一顆松實擲去，正打中她的臉頰。</p>
<p>（阿唷唷……該死的！）</p>
<p>她手摸着臉，臉紅啦。</p>
<p>（哈……哈……嘻……嘻……）</p>
<p>小癩痢笑得轉不過氣。正當他們笑得一團的時候，阿牛哥陡的跑了進來。</p>
<p>（又笑什麽？快把菜端出去！）</p>
<p>看看灶下的小癩痢，他又説：</p>
<p>（整天就胡閙，看給你吃楊柳條！）</p>
<p>小癩痢癟起嘴，不理他。</p>
<p>他走了。廚房間便没有了笑聲，只聽見菜油的沸滾聲，和荳殻的炸裂聲。</p>
<h3>客窗小記</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十五</p>
<p>古來許多文章，若很好的加以删節，往往成爲比原作更爲優秀的文章，殊殊是記事文，把那些迂腐的議論，庸俗的頭尾除去，簡直是可以成爲妙品。我個人是很歡喜這樣做。如王衡的（東門觀桃花記），我曾經删去全文的頭尾，成爲如次的一短篇：</p>
<p>余性獨深愛桃花，每春未嘗不游，游必偏。今年二月之十七日，予與汝增約，使人往探城四隅，問花之所止而之焉。具報東門好，則步出東門，踏菜花行，望見一村居，小有柳桃可觀，則酒䤌與蒲席已次第設矣。其居在小溪中，桃花左右。溪上約有三四十株，甚嫩美。旣又移至吳氏莊，莊宅與池相遶。略同前，而廣五倍之。花碩大且繁，中一緋色，據水上者特異。長楊數章列池外，如偉丈夫衣冠供手，而護少女子於内。桃花亦醉面埀埀，傍水洗妝，不輕見頭額也。飲樹下留連久之。</p>
<p>這可説是一篇紀游的神妙小品。然原文則長至五零五字，其冒頭佔三十五字，後面的庸俗的迂腐之論又佔二八九字，删去三百二十四字，留一百八十一字，乃成此文。對於過往的不少的作品，我覺得在研究古籍者，大可以下一番這樣的工夫，來從事整理。但我的意思，並不是要大家去迷戀古骸骨。古骸骨的迷戀與古籍的研究，其間是大有分别，</p>
<h3>（兩兄弟）（五七）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>哲安自從得到遺産後，每天在考慮着究竟娶她呢還是不娶。每次他見到她的時候，覺得自己已經决心討她做老婆了，隨後，等到只剩着自己一個人的時候，他又想到不妨慢慢地再考慮考慮罷。現在她不及他富足了，因爲她每年祗有一萬二千佛郎左右的收入，不過她的財富都是不動産，都是哈佛爾盆地的田土；而這種不動産，往後是可以值得一大注錢的。這樣看來，彼此的財産是差不多的了，而那青年寡婦又確乎是他所很喜歡的。</p>
<p>這天，他望着她在前面走着，他心裏想：（得啦，我要决定了才行。我一定不能找到比她更好的了。）</p>
<p>他們沿着一個由村落降到崖壁的傾斜的小谷前進：那峯壁在這小谷的盡頭以八十米突的高度俯臨海面。在那往左右兩邊低下去的，青青的海岸的框子裏，遠遠地現出了一塊三角形的，在太陽底下像銀子一樣藍的水，一隻差不多看不見了的帆船彷彿一種昆虫似的浮在那兒。那滿是陽光的天空和海不混在一塊，簡直使人分不出彼此的界限來：走在三個男子前面的兩個女人，便在這明朗的地平線上畫着她們那包在短衣裏面的身材。</p>
<p>哲安目光炯炯，瞧着陸醉米太太那瘦小的脚踝，精緻的腿子，婀娜的腰身，眩目的大草帽等在他的前面逃出。這種逃遁更加鼓起了他的欲望，使他漸漸採取了一般猶疑的人和怯懦的人所突然採取的那種决心。而那混着海岸的氣味，亞鐘（Ajone），苜蓿和青草的幽香，露出水面的礁石的腥氣的微温的空氣，一面把他緩緩地陶醉着，一面更使他興奮了，他每行一步路，每過一秒鐘，每對那少婦的活潑的身影看一次，便更加决定了一點：他决定不再躊躇，决定要對她説他愛她並且想要娶她。捕蝦的事是可以供他利用的，這使他們容易得到私語的機會；並且這還是一個美麗的環境呢，一個美麗的講愛情的地方呢，把兩脚揷在儲滿清水的凹地，一面望着海蝦的長鬚在海草底下逃走。</p>
<p>當他們走到小谷的盡頭，走到深淵的邊上時，他們瞧見有一條羊腸仄徑沿着崖壁下去，在他們脚下，在海與山麓之間，在山腰左近，有一堆驚人的巨石，崩落，倒塌，亂七八糟的堆在一種長着青草的，起伏着的平原上，這一直向南奔去終於看不見了的平原是往日海岸崩塌所造成的。在這一條長着荆棘並摇拽着淺草的悠長地帶，那由於火山的突發而落下來的岩石的好像一個消失了的以前背負着海岸的無盡的白壁，俯視着海洋的大城的廢墟而落下來的岩石</p>
<p>（啊，這眞美，）陸太太停住脚説。</p>
<p>哲安追上了她，心裏卜卜地跳着，伸手給她攙她下那刻在岩石上的仄梯。</p>
<p>他們在前面走了，同時博齊汝船長把自己的身子堅定在那兩條短腿上，伸過彎着的手臂給那被深淵駭暈了的羅蘭媽媽。</p>
<p>羅蘭和筆爾下去得最後，醫生不得不牽着他父親，羅蘭簡直暈眩得祇好讓自己被兒子拖着一級一級的溜了下去。</p>

<p>提倡生育  新　　最近在報端看見有這樣的一段新聞；（路透柏林電：希特勒政府近爲鼓勵青年男女結婚起見，曾頒佈命令，凡結婚之男女得向政府借資以充購買家具等物之用，此項計劃，今已收效，柏林一地已有一萬人向註册處申請借欵，如願以償者五千人，被駁斥者八百四十七人，其餘尚在考慮中，凡未婚夫婦得合六百馬克）這裏足見得德國之注意國家的人口哪。　　我國所受到列强的壓迫計凡三種：政治壓迫，經濟壓迫，和人口壓迫。我國近年來常受烈强的壓迫，加以内憂外患，天災人禍，我們所唯一依靠着的，就是説我國有人口四萬萬，我們對外在肉搏的時候，也能以十當一的抵抗着。然而因兵災水患所傷失的人民，又是偌大的一個數目呀！回頭看看列强們人口的增加，出於我們意料之外的迅速，然而我們呢？有減而無增。我們畢竟要成全了列强的三大壓迫了。　　昨天看了遠勝於細膩的，香艷的育肉感的祗能予人以麻醉的蘇聨性教育影，片（健美的女性）回來，我知道：婦女生理上變化的事情是不須秘寗的，是需要麽開的研究和指導的。（健全之國民，産於健全之母親，故欲强種，須先强母體）這是這張影片裏用畫面和字幕告訴我們的。　　我們再看看我們的古香古色的祖國！寡婦是應該守節，尼姑的終身孤獨；再不然，縱淫荒誕，大播其弱種亡族的種子。小女心情  文炳　　園漸漸的與先前有些異樣了，從伊的來信中，看得分明，一顆少女的心情，已在騰熱的向上飛奔。以前伊不常常來信，要有事才那麽簡單的結我一紙報告，詞句是那麽莊重，不輕漏洩一線心情，不輕説句稍爲挑釁的情話，自己是那麽持重嫻靜，對我是那麽尊警禮待，幾乎使我疑想伊是一位（石女）。我呢，因爲年歲比伊來得大，學識自然要高長些，知道那麽一個年青的孩子，萬萬不能以自己的心情，越程的以某種態度去擾亂伊的寗靜，所以我總（就勢）的擺出一幅教師似的面像，處處向伊説大話。比如説，伊問我春天的心情，爲什麽總是慌亂而又怪鬱結的，我便告訴伊那完全是自然給予的影響，是（動）的春象的原故；伊問我要怎樣才能學得會做文章，我就告訴伊要平日多看多讀多做多體念實際的生活；伊告訴我身體很弱，時常害病，我就呌伊多多運動。　　我們一逕就這樣淡淡往還，雖然結識已不是一年半載了，但確實的，事實上好比是泛泛之交的朋友。這，我此刻還認爲是不錯，因爲我們的生活的圈子是這樣狹隘，在我固然有呌不出的苦楚，伊又正受着家庭的束縛，得不到弟兄們的體諒，天天在緊縮與不安中過活。這樣若單單在紙上（卿來我往）的説白，無疑的是會更加劇彼此的煩惱，甚至引帶出一些無名的痛苦。我只想拚命的掙扎，看再過三兩年以後，是怎樣獲得一人，小的段落，那時若是勉强的活，我們也就好甘苦共嘗的同住在一塊，以前一切的創傷，都待歸那時去洗濯他，這意思，我曾幾番婉曲的向伊暗示，伊大槪也意識透了，所以伊也常常勉勵我，勉勵我的夢，多少有些枝朶能得開花結實。　　然而伊近來漸漸的有些異樣了，不久以前，伊發表一個信，像哀的美敦書一樣，充分的懷疑以外，還帶些責難的意味，長篇大章寫滿了三頁，而意思却很單純，就是説我不應老是向伊擺弄教師似的架子，伊可以做教師似的妻室，却不能眞做教師的學生，更從旁引證好些例子，某某的未婚夫的信是怎樣的稱呼某某，信内又是怎樣的一些話語，伊看了，緊隘的心，都彷彿沾受了些滋潤，要是我有那樣的信給伊，伊是何等的歡樂呵！　　還有些信，多是説因爲强烈的記念我，以致連端正的在看書或上課的時候都發起呆來，晚上常常睡不着，更常常無緣無故的感受心慌，不知我也是不是這樣，伊渴望我能告知伊這些，毫不隠諱的。　　有時候我寫信去告訴伊我在害病，伊就接三連三的寄發信來，説伊有説不出的痛苦與罪過，因爲伊不能侍則慰藉我，信上是寄遞不了伊的伊心情。　　還有，伊説説伊的媽媽是怎樣的不願意擔負伊的學費了，哥哥嫂嫂又是怎樣的對伊閒話冷笑，都使伊挨受不了。　　自然，這些不能説完全不是事實。　　不過，我倒是更想着：伊的一顆少女的心情，已騰熱的在向上飛發，伊不但渴切的需要通信上的温存，而且更需要（超呼此）的寄托了。　　廿二、十二、六、製。</p>

<p>尋民記  曲辰　　某日之夕，晚餐已畢，獨坐書齋，方伸紙握管，凝神苦思，忽忽若有所見。似置身通衢，四顧茫茫，莫知所適。忽見一人，足登皮鞋，肩背雨傘，行色匆匆，從東而來。余乃進而謁曰：（先生皇皇，其將何之？）其人不暇作答，頻頻拭其額上之汗。徐俟喘息稍定，乃曰：（我乃投機巨商，行販好手，平生衣食，全靠奔走，兼會摇唇鼓舌，有人名我爲走狗。今因公債停板，標金跌落，營業失利，悶悶不樂。近聞（民）價飛漲，此中頗有厚利可圖，但此項貨物，所進不多，四出張羅，不辭奔波，子能偕行，將愁一生吃着不盡，豈不勝於爲區區數元稿費，伏案終日乎？）余正無聊，乃應曰：（諾！）　　遂相將西進，道經楊樹之浦，至曹家之渡，有一工人，停機而坐。乃趨前問曰：（工友貴姓？）答云；（姓民。）其人大樂，面現笑容。拍工人之肩而曰：（幸福來了！何事苦此！方今天下有道，庶人爲貴。政府新建，號曰（人民），生産歸公，扶助勞動，子能從我，幸福無窮！）工人失笑，曰：（先生体矣！無乃道窮？我有二手，其堅如鐵，我有二足，其快如風，幸福自求，豈待奉送，假手他人，結果終凶！請觀現在袞袞諸公，又那一個不是腰纏充充？高座巍巍，又那一個不是我們姓民的抬轎之功？但政治塲中，全靠脱空，一登寳座，傳將抬轎的踢落西風。空頭支票，已積得盈箱盈籠。今日的蹩脚，無非是昔日的英雄，又何分乎彼此，更何有乎西東！把戲原只有這幾套，今番再不敢相往！先生識相，快點轉篷！）言罷不答。其人嗒然，牽余衣更進。怳怳忽忽，莫辨西東，隠見一人，臥於田中，趨前細視，乃一老翁，其人喜曰：（工人意識，究竟不新，今觀此翁，頗有精神，眞正人民，無乃在此？）乃摇而醒之，翁矍然以驚，揉其老花之眼，指余二人曰：（先生何人？緣何見臨？）其人答曰：（老翁在此，意欲何待？零露風吹，詎不傷壞！耘人之田，昔賢不爲，今之新政，古風可追，計口授田，曷興乎來！）老翁聞言，忽爾勃然。戟指言曰：（汝輩掮客，只知弄錢，東奔西走，鬼話連篇。前年革命，二子喪元，賸有雛孫，伴我翁眠，苛捐未去，雜税連連！終歲勤勞，衣食不全，啼飢呼寒，更有誰憐，更有誰憐？闊人闊老，槪不問焉，一條老命，苟延天年。抬轎缺人，今又來前，子觀前轍，何復何言！）同行者聞言，急謂（不然！翁因年邁，又怕刀兵，但請至城西一行，充當老牌人民，不需其他手續，只要喊上口號三聲，自非（赴湯蹈火），不過表示一點民情！將來大功告成，大家都有光榮，非特鄙人心感，抑可分享太平。）翁曰：（子做子夢，我夢已醒，多少白骨，造成多少英名，一般牛鬼蛇神，做不出新鮮的事情，倘然要享太平，還該自己經營。將看鋤頭起處，發音聲如雷霆。請勿擾我清夢，我將等待天明。）老翁言畢，即倒臥田塍之上，呼呼而睡。推之不醒，呌之不應，訪問二次，始終找不到一個眞正的人民。其人顔色沮喪，忽忽若有所失。踉蹌前行，忽見路旁一破裏，乃負其二尊菩薩以去，據云聊以塞責，亦可以應急用。方握手告别，忽然而寤，乃身猶未出書齋一步也。都市裏的君子  一琴　　（喂，票子！）從高郎橋開出到大世界去的十七路無軌電車的三等車廂裏，有一位乘客這樣喊。　　同車的人，目光不期集中到這位乘客身上。　　那乘客年約四十多歲，身穿已經退了色的緞子袍褂，頭戴一頂瓜皮小帽，鼻架眼鏡，鄉態可掬的，顯然是初從樸實的鄉村投到這萬惡的都市裏來的一個。　　（噢，來了，請等一等，勿要吵！）賣票的在人叢裏擠來擠去照例是笑嘻嘻地説，這經騐在他是很豐富的，他知道應怎樣對付這一類的乘客。　　（銅子早已給你了，票子爲什麽没有？）那位乘客很不明白，還是咕嚕着。　　於是旁的人，也有在暗藏着笑。　　（朋友！票子拿去！）賣票的很無奈地軋了一張票子給他，然而帶着椰榆地神情説。意思是在説：（你這可憐的鄉曲！）　　（喂，賣票的，錯了，這是十八分的票子呢！）他看着手中的票子，又看看車窗口電車公司的告白：（乘客注意：所購之票，與所給付之車資，是否相符。）他想顯然的，這是賣票者的不誠實。不禁勃然大怒，終於喊了出來。　　（吵什麽？）賣買的顯然也有點不耐煩了。（你到那裏？）他忿然地問。　　（到大世界。）　　（你到大世界，包你到就是了。吵什麽！）已賣票的很巧妙地避開了票子數目的爭執問題，而談到路程上去。　　（不，我給你的是二十個銅子，而這裏却只有十八分的票子，還少着二個銅子呢！）他還斤斤於實數與票面的差。　　於是好管閒事的朋友出來了。　　一位坐在他旁邊的年輕小夥子先就忍不住笑説：　　（朋友！反正你到大世界就是了，何必多響？）他是以老上海的資格説這話。　　（他揩公司裏的油，又關你什麽事）　　（又不是揩你的油！）　　（大家是中國人，何必替外人帮忙？）　　（哼！）　　（……）　　於是他來了一個孤立的恐懼，他開始懷疑，他不懂衆人爲什麽都派他不是，他覺得他並没有錯。但他没有説，在這環境之下，也不容辨説。　　最後，賣票的深恐他再吵起來，給（赤老）聽見了，可不要爲了二個銅子，換去一隻大洋，這賣買有點不上算，終於換給了他一張二十分的票子，才算無事。　　車子到了站，他下去了，賣票者在後頭看着他，嘴裏迸出了二個字（猪玀！）　　但他始終是不懂，恐怕至今還不懂他所以錯的地方吧？</p>

<p>現代名人書畫羅惇㬊字旉安廣東順德人檔存先生　　宋元　　　句志佩　恶　在时能　丹　妙愛心可传辛酉　　　　三四　移寫記　　皇后的歌聲  時　　我們的皇后Ｃ姑娘，除了有着一張美麗的臉蛋之外，天還特地賦與她以宛轉的珠喉，所以非但她的姿色引人徴逐，她的歌聲，更使人銷魂。　　夜，什麽都靜寂了，從靜寂的空氣裏，却傳來了清脆的歌聲。　　這歌聲，又尖，又圓，又悠揚，誰都知道是從皇后的櫻口裏傳出來的　　這時候，本該是熟睡的時候了，可是一聽到了這種歌聲，大家便都歇司的里亞地從牀上跳了起來，倚着欄杆，傾聽着從輕風裏飄蕩過來的歌聲。　　嬝嬝不絶的歌聲，總要繼續着這麽半個或一個鐘頭，才告停歇，可是那留下來的深長的韻味却是無窮盡的，牠像劃破了幽靜的夜，無涯際的擴展開來。　　於是大家嗒然若喪的返到牀上，可是翻來覆去，那裏還睡得着呢！歌聲像一個魔鬼，永遠繚繞在腦際。　　患失眠症者大有人在。　　這樣一月之後，在佈告板上便發見了這樣的一張佈告。　　（查邇來每晚十時以後，正大家好夢方酣之際，女生宿舍中常有歌聲發出，實屬擾人清睡，俟後不得再行如此，特此佈告。）　　從此以後，皇后的歌聲便没有了，可是患失眠症的人却更來得多了，因爲深刻的記憶是很難磨滅得掉的。這實在是出佈告的人所始料不及的。業餘信箱　不好意思去問編者先生：　　你偉大的言論，能指示人們煩惱的迷津，這是貴刊讀者早有的定論，毋容我來瑣瑣了。　　在這非常時期的中國，我們青年人應當如何地奮鬭，努力去求世界大同，人類平等的工作，關於我的疑問，似乎很不對的。但是我的意志戰不過心理，所以仍舊寫出來，向你請教，我候你不致推辭吧！　　在五年前，我入某教會學校肄業，有同班某君，和我情投意洽，竟然成了莫逆交。他有位妹妹，年紀與我不相上下，在某女中肄業，相貌品行均佳，我在見她之後，心中很自然地生了愛慕心。但是在這五年中，我是非常膽小和害羞，總不敢對她談話。不過她似乎對我發生好感，因爲我們雖始終没有講過話，但是在見面的時候，總不免互相點首微笑。　　本月是某君的婚期，我是無疑地前去賀喜。在他的妹妹驀然看見我時，又給我一個深刻的媚笑；我也就還她一笑。如是我倆的眼角，時時相遥應了。我明瞭她對我是多情的；但是我没有機會接近她，她家的人很多呢！　　現在我實在是心猿意馬，再也忍不住，想和她結交一個朋友。不過她已訂婚否？這點我不便明白地問她的哥哥，我想直接問她，但是又没有機會，（她的學校，我是知道的，不過如何去接近她呢？）我始終想不出完善的主意，所以只有煩優我們的指　者，－先生－來指教我如何去進行吧！　　話説的太多，侵佔了不少篇幅，恕我就此止住吧！敬祝撰安　郁道孚謹上　　編者按：一個人的處世，應當要率眞；心裏有什麽希望，不妨就大大方方地向着目標去追求。幸而成功，固屬快事；不幸而失敗，也好及早覺悟，改弦更張，庶不致書空咄咄廢時失業。如其藏頭露尾，畏却不前；那末即使本可如願的事情，也會失去時機，弄得老大無成。　　郁君的來信，處處表現他是一個畏首畏尾，不能率眞的個性。明明求所以成全佳偶之道，却硬要東拉西扯，説上許多（世界大同）（人類平等）一類的廢話。這種態度一天不改掉，不要説這段良緣，永無希望，你的終身事業，也絶少。成就的可能。　　我們知道，一個尚未有愛人的青年男子，向一個異性追求，是很合乎自然的；只要出之以大方，法律輿論，均不會加以攻擊。所以郁君儘可要求她的哥哥從中介紹；也儘可直接向對方通欵曲。即使對方的環境，是充滿封建色彩的，那麽也可央個冰人，前去問名。一説即合，也是意中之事，撞個頂子，也可絶此妄想。小説上海（十七）  張老三　　（恐怕遲早要發生的吧）！　　我和衣睡到床上，轉側着敏姊不能這樣不原諒我，你冒了危險，從鄉下追隨我到上海來，我們兩次忠實的談話，你也應該明白我人格的一切。一個豪放的女子，在戀愛的道上，何以心地狹窄到不能容髮呢？我明天的無論如何得向慧姊剖白。想到這裏，像得了結論似的安心睡去。　　第二天起了個早，到方外别墅。那門房滿堆着笑臉説：（少爺，老爺還没有起身哩。）　　（你們小姐呢？）　　（今天禮拜，昨夜回來的）。説着引我到客廳中，他進内通報，出來他説小姐也没有起身。　　（説我有要緊話説，煩你再去通報一聲）。　　一個娘姨模樣的中年婦人跟着門户出來説：（小姐病了，請表少爺過一天來。　　（什麽病）？我急急地問？　　（昨夜回家時吹了風，發着寒熱。）　　（請小姐保重點，我過一天再來。）　　（少爺，再坐一會啊。）　　我没有回答門房的話，逕自走出方外别墅。　　二十七橋下的流水　　信着脚步走，直往徐家匯鄉下去。我重復接近了連綿的阡陌，農夫農婦白手巾包着頭，屈膝在被陽光炙焦着的水田中，耕耘他們視爲第二生命的財産，他們那樣的快活，唱着粗俗的農歌。田中的秧，碧綠可愛，迎着微風波浪似的推動。我在小石橋畔坐定，瞧着他們工作不想再走。橋下的流下中泳游着一羣小鴨，逆水划動瞨前進，再順水浮回來，牠們没有知道將來長成後供給人們的宰殺。　　大槪坐的太久了，農夫們都驚奇的注視着我，但是我不認識他們其中的一個，也没有問我（吃過早飯？）的。其實這時候太陽已偏西，我背上隠隠的作痛，五月中旬的陽光已那樣炙人。就站起身向徐家匯走去，走了半天，好像比來時的路增加了一倍。太陽曬到背上，一襲夾衫已不勝其重，今天兩頓又没有進餐，到徐家匯鎭，肚中飢餓再不能忍受，而且需要休息一下，就踏進一家小館飽餐一頓。　　從電車上顚簸了半小時，因爲空腹飽餐的緣故，心中怪賦悶似的，在辣斐德路行人道上歸來，被我發見了一塊氷的市招，這時這一類的飲料再適合不過，進去喝了一杯刨氷，纔覺得遍體舒適，凉快無比。在電扇下翻着英文報紙，抽了兩支烟回社。　　高飛等已等候了我半天，對於我的不别而行，很是担憂。我説　　（起來時候太早，誰都没有起身，呌我對那個去説話？）　　（一大天到那裏去的？）　　（徐家匯。）　　（遇見姐姐没有？）弟弟問我。　　（没有。）　　（敏姊也一早出門了啊。）　　大家感到事情的不尋常，相對着没有話説。平時這間嬉謔百出的辦公室，今天像深山中的古寺。小黄不吸烟的，也抓起罐中的香烟燃着呼起來。默默的天色漸漸黑暗，誰都没有想着開電燈。　　（幹麽）還是哈台來扮演一齣喜劇，他踏着冬瓜步扭亮了電燈（青萍來，下一般象棋，你讓我一隻車夠了）。　　大家移動身體到我的寫字台旁。哈台本是我手下的敗將，讓兩隻車，還不夠招架，他欣欣然地搬出象棋，我知道他想完成一齣吃賸一顆將的喜劇。我不忍回絶他調和空氣的善意，我們對弈起來。　　▲啓事今日所載小説，應在昨日所載之前，因係誤排，今特補刊</p>

<p>電影專刊瑙瑪希拉的戀愛史（上）　（一）初到紐約渡着模特兒的生活　　那是在紐約的一個寒天，一個瘦小的女子穿了一件青色的浴衣，躺在一張沙發上。她覺得離開百萬之財還遠得很——照事實説，她離開六個小錢倒還覺得近些。她疲倦恍惚地躺着，懶怠着走幾步路去接那電話。她聽見電話鈴響，她的頭在枕頭上更睡得深些。在百老匯的優伶介紹所裏坐了一天的硬板凳，當然覺得沙發上的枕墊又柔軟又温暖的。電話的鈴停止了，她歎了一口氣。她知道她應當努力一下去接那電話，或者意是她萬一的機緣呢。但是在她青青的年齡中，這是第一次覺得這樣疲乏了。她擦去了一滴思鄉之涙，她想着遥遥千里之外，遠在坎拿大的一個鄉村，她離開了家庭，所爲是什麽呢？幾個月以來，她等候着，盼望着，去做些小片子中的殘碎角色，額外演員，在廣告圖畫部裏做模特兒，但她總是希望着，祈禱着將來的成功。　　電話的鈴，突然又響了。聲音急促的很，好像在呌（快來接我呀！快來接我呀！）這更使她的頭疼得厲害些。最後，她没有法子，祇好爬了起來，走去屋子，無精打采地去接那電話。（哈囉，哈囉，希拉小姐嗎？瑙瑪希拉小姐嗎？）那很像公事房裏接綫女職員的聲音。（是的，我就是希拉小姐。）（明天早晨準十點，你能到寰球影片公司來一趟嗎？我們的西部經理泰爾堡先生呌我們和你接洽拍片子的事呢。）　　瑙瑪希拉掛上了電話，眼睛裏透着快樂的光輝，在屋子裏跳着華爾茲式的舞，疲倦亦不知一忽兒那裏去。她——瑙瑪希拉——在百老匯躑躅了這許久，居然在一小角色裏被人家看見了而喜歡。她的的確確是好萊塢的一個攝製家挑選出來的。她連忙尋出她最好的衣衫，一面機着，一面鼻子裏哼出快活的調兒。　　但是運神還是戲弄着人。明天晚上她還是躺在晚上作床，白天作沙發的大椅子裏，青色的睡衣緊緊裹在她身上。這位坎拿大的女子，没有能和寰球公司訂合同。公司祇肯給她些零碎角色，薪水亦渺小得很。瑙瑪覺得她應當得着較好的待遇，不然的話，她一天三餐，恐怕都難維持了。所以她計算着從明天起，又要在紐約的無窮無盡的長街上去行走了。她翻着自己的日記本，看着裏面拉雜的記載：（十六天了——還是賺着十塊錢一個禮拜，賣着帽子，拖鞋，手套，襪子……今天站了一天，給畫了一張汽車胎的廣告牌，聽説要在哥倫布馬戲塲掛三年之久哩……呀，想不到已經變文雅了，居然可以售賣細貸，像皮毛，銀器，磁器等等東西了……今天運氣眞好，第一天進影片公司。我在一家介紹所裏坐着，等候照例的（今天没有事，請回家吧。）我正在看一本雜誌，上面有我的相片，穿了一件華美的皮大衣。你看看自己笑了起來，恐怕是不過一個苦笑，因爲我自己的大衣是極薄的而冬天又已降臨了。可巧一位副經理在我後面。他看了雜誌的相片，面貌和我有些相像，就問我是不是那個模特兒。我説是的。他説明天再來，有事給我做。他答應我三天的事情，在一個跳舞的塲面裏……我拍影片的工作，祇可以説是告一段落了。我還可以重回模特兒的生活，不過我還得去尋找呀！……（未完）影片談評評（舞台三傑）  凌鶴　　Broadway　to　Hollywoodl　　（一）　　據美國雜誌的記載，（舞台三傑）是美國近來偉大影片之一。當然，每一個民族的生活情感各自不同，也許美國的所認爲偉大的地方，對於我們不見得就有同樣的體念。　　　　（二）　　（舞台三傑）中有着冗長的故事。因此，僅僅足爲了故事的叙述，便絶對需要很多的鏡頭。那末在有限量的膠片中，如完全爲了叙述故事，另一方面，做戲的機便一定縮到最低限度。我們不能不承認（亂世春秋）是一部偉大的作品，但因其故事太長，於是令人感覺劇的沉悶與煩雜，但以其與（舞台三傑）相比較，其成績應在此片之上，雖然二片的作者對於作品都有着十分愼重的態度。　　（三）　　因爲故事太長的原故，導演Willard　Mack不能不用簡潔的手法，以减短影片的長度。在這裏我們可看到戰爭的場面的省却，以及旦特第三的由小至大，自小時候的照片上絞出去等。前者的方法，的確十分聰明，前一場是父親接讀來信，道一聲（好孩子）而頽然若失，接上便是孩兒問他父親到那裏去了，而以手杖比擬戰爭，立刻説明老哈開脱的兒子戰死沙場。然而這些地方是不容易使不常接近電影的人們所能看懂的，因此其是否有存在價值，尚是疑問。　　（四）　　在這裏應當説到作品的主題了。　　記得在詹寗斯的（天之驕子）中，我們曾經體念到藝人們没落的悲哀。這同樣的情感，我們在這（舞台三傑）中再度領受。（天之驕子）是一個藝人由極盛時代轉入没落，再由没落面後興，而（舞台三傑）中却是説演員們的聲譽，隨着年齡而消逝，其悲哀的代價只是讓兒孫重振家聲。加之有聲電影逐漸的代替了舞台戲劇之地位，百老匯的寳座已向好萊塢推移。這因然也是使無台上的老明星感覺悲哀的原因之一，可是春光老去，始終是不可挽留，當年在觀衆喝采聲中久享榮譽的老哈開脱夫婦，免不了有年青的人們來代替他們的地位：只好聽着别人在耳邊嘆息着説：（他年輕，他新鮮……）而自身只得十分賣力而落得無聲無息以下場。最後的希望，由兒子身上轉移於孫兒。直至孫兒由於祖父的督促而成名，而自身亦含笑而死。一生爲戲劇而終天年，幸有賢良的兒孫接受了先人之衣鉢，同樣，也許作者是暗示着説：（百老匯的歌劇不免没落，幸而有好萊塢的歌舞電影繼其寳座）。於是乎。没落的悲哀不必同感了。　　（五）　　我們承認，這决不是這無無成績的作品。至少有其特殊之處，很顯然的。這裏有快樂也有悲哀，所謂悲喜劇的調和，這一影片的作者很可以居功。次之如幾次非常自然的高潮，也處理得十分得當。如哈開脱第二的夫婦爭吵，如老哈開脱責駡哈開脱第三的時候至於老哈開脱在攝影場死去的時候，那十分緊張的情緒在觀衆極力忍耐之中，眞是别開生面。　　（六）　　佛蘭克毛根自少至老，情態畢肖，特别是老年時更見成功。女角AliceBrady也演得極好，至爲賈克古柏却毫無成績。反之飾幼年時代之哈開脱第三到還可以。關於吉訶德的趣聞  馨甫　　西萬提司不朽名著一吉訶德先生的攝成影片，各情已誌本報·現在我來將關於本書和本片的趣事，説點給各位聽聽：　　Ａ中國皇帝差人到西班牙去　　在（吉訶德先生）下卷的跋語裏，西萬提司説了一個笑話。他説中國皇帝曾經差了一個大臣到西政牙來，要求作者把這部小説送去，因爲中國預備開一個專門學校，在這個學校裏，卡司特兒的文學是要教授的；所以中國皇帝想把這本（吉訶德先生）當作教科書。這個笑話是很有趣的。在西萬提司，當初不過是一種幻想。但是現在竟實現了。不但這部書，中國學校有的把它當作教本；並且（吉訶德）影片，也來到中國開映了。　　Ｂ夏亞平財産被政府没收　　本片的主角夏亞平，他在歌壇上，早就享着盛名，在俄國，卽使窮山僻野的婦人孺子，也知道夏亞平這個名字，但是，能夠欣賞夏亞平的藝術的，却並不怎麽多，因爲他所演奏的塲所，都是最高等的戲院，並且價錢賣得很貴，一班窮措大，祗好對他望望，後來，俄國革命發生，他急忙逃到巴黎去，他在莫斯科的一座華貴住宅，此外還有價值十萬金鎊的不動産，都給蘇俄政府没收了，可是這幾年以來，他又儲蓄了很多的錢，在巴黎做起富翁來了，　　Ｃ大文豪的驢子做臨時演員　　Ｈ．Ｗ．威爾斯，是現代一位大文豪，不久以前，大光明開映的（豹姑娘），就是根據他的小説（喪魂之島）攝成的，當（吉訶德）影片攝製時，那劇中的山差邦扎，缺少了一頭小驢，飾山差的喬紹羅柏，從前本來也是一位名作家。恰巧威爾斯有一頭很好的小驢，羅柏就跑去見他，向他借來一用，威爾斯馬上答應了他，於是大文豪的小驢，就做了（魔俠吉訶德）片中的臨時演員了。華婉芳女士失寳  阿寳　　著名電影女明星華婉芳女士，家藏價值鉅萬的貓兒眼珍寳一颗度，忽然被一個署名江南燕的人曉得了，假籌募貧兒教養院基金爲名，致書索借；她以爲傅家之寳，一旦有失，非但她老病的父親要急死，便是一家靠這東西維持的信用，也要立即崩潰；她没有辦法，後來她想着私家偵探霍桑的幹練，忙趕去和他商量，但是這寳物，在幾個授受中，眞的失去了；女士却蒙在鼓裏，後來經過種種奇詭曲折的偵查，終於合浦珠還；原來是鄭君里和她玩的把戲，倒使權充霍桑的尚冠武，和助手鮑良，做了許多許多的細密工作。　　這是一齣電影劇友聨公司轉變作風以後的佳製，由偵探小説名家程小青先生，所作的小説（江南燕）改編的。十五日起，便在中央大戲院開映了。（却酬）電影小説花蕚情深（Little　Woman）（八）  素因　　勞萊等到醫生走了，馬上就跑過來問蓓絲的病狀。他看見了奇奥狼狽的樣子，也嚇得慌了起來。奇奥説：（你還是去打個電報吧。要是媽嬭在這裏就好了。）勞萊道：（媽嬭就要回來的。你知道，我的祖父近日心神很不安寗，因爲他曾答應你的母親，照顧你們的。要是；所以他昨天就打了一個電報給她。她今天下午就要到的，我還要去接她呢。）奇奥聽見了，又哭又笑，她竟抱住了勞萊吻著他，勞萊驚喜過份地樓著她，心房卜卜地跳著。過了一回，他裝著平靜，對奇奥道：（除非你再吻我，我是不能再多費時候了。我還要去接火車呢。）奇奥拭著眼涙，笑著把勞萊送走了，就上樓將媽嬭回來的消息去告訴美格。　　一回醫生又來了。勞倫斯先生亦來了。他默不作聲地坐在病房門外。裏面大家寂靜無聲。一回兒醫生的手動了，他已經把完了脈，將病人的手慢慢兒放了下來。大家嚇得面如土色地靜待著醫生的宣佈。難這她已經没有氣了嗎？醫生的聲音有些發抖，可是是有希望的聲音。他慢慢地説道：（熱度是已經退些了。病勢已有轉機。她現在是睡得很好的。）　　門外馬車的聲音，越走越近了。美格，奇奥等等連忙奔來樓去。勞倫斯老先生走在前面，回過頭來拿眼睛問著他們。他們點著點，勞倫斯亦放心了。等到勞倫斯開了門，媽嬭扶了勞勞的手進來了。她看見了勞倫斯，手扶了他的手臂，亦没有工夫説什麽感激的話，就上樓了。她在病房的門口遇見了醫生，他將好消息告訴了她。她就走了進去，和美格，奇奥，大家默然跪在蓓絲的床前，感謝蒼天的涙珠，潄潄不斷地落了下來。　　好像上天總不讓他們儘量快活似的，蓓絲的痊愈是極慢的。到底大家亦不知道她終究能復元不能。等到到了夏天了。有一天是蓓絲病後下樓的第一次。奇奥强健的臂膊，輕輕將蓓絲抱了下來。椅子上舖滿了椅墊，蓓絲嬌弱的身體坐在上面。勞萊進來張了張，喊道：（讓她看看什麽人來了！）是於大家讓出一條路，約翰勃羅克去開了門，一個人走了進來——原來是父親！一種不可思議的歡樂，把大家都楞住了。可是一回兒大家恢復了原狀，大家歡然的摟抱著，吻著。蓓絲亦高興得站了起來。馬區先生將他脆弱的女兒，抱了起來，又抱翰輕輕地放在椅子裏。大家都看著他們的擁抱，這兩個幾乎脱離塵衰的人。在這個時候，約翰勃羅克和勞萊，都覺得這是他們家庭間最神聖的光陰，於是就躡手躡足地走開去了。大家等父親和蓓絲擁抱了一回：就七嘴八舌的問他：（你怎樣回來的？爲什麽你不先打個電報？你完全好了嗎？你還回去不回去？）（未完）</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang's representative, Lin Yizhong, and the Political Council's representative, Liu Jiwen, visited Zhang Ji again on the morning of the 12th. After detailed discussions, they called on Hu to seek instructions on how to respond. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wu Chaoshu returned to Hong Kong on the 12th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Xiangen and Chen Rong continued to come to Hong Kong on the evening of the 12th under the order of the Political Council to meet with Zhang and others. Zhang and others are scheduled to leave Guangdong on the 15th to meet Li Bai in Guilin, return to Hong Kong on the 18th, and return to Shanghai on the President Pierce. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The 12th was Hu Hanmin's birthday. Zhang Ji and other representatives from Guangdong who came to Hong Kong went to offer birthday congratulations and discussed the current situation. Therefore, Zhang and others changed their plans and took the ship to Guangdong Province in the evening, arriving on the morning of the 13th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council decided on the 12th that as soon as Zhang and others arrive in the province, a meeting of the Executive Department and Political Council will be held to discuss how to respond. Tang Shaoyi was also telegraphed to come to the province to participate. The committee members decided to go to the dock to welcome Zhang and others on the morning of the 13th. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 11th. The Guangdong side also dispatched Liu Jiwen and Lin Yizhong to welcome them. After Zhang and others met with Hu and exchanged opinions, they went to Guangzhou with Liu and others. The Southwest Committee members held a joint meeting on the 11th to discuss countermeasures. Chen Jitang spoke, (1) He had no opinions on the current situation. (2) Troops were stationed in Dongjiang to guard against the Jiangxi bandits.

The negotiations between the peace representatives and the local Westerners will be extremely important to the future of China. Whether war can be avoided depends on the outcome of the discussions between the two sides. The Southwest Political Council and Executive Committee's dispatch of personnel to Hong Kong to welcome the Central peace representatives is sufficient to show that the Southwest leaders' advocacy of sincere national unity with the Central government is not completely ignored.

They are now looking for a shortcut to resolve the current situation. (12th New Sound News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren and others sent a telegram to Zhang Ji and other four Central Committee members, saying, "Respectfully, upon receiving your esteemed telegram (11th), we learned with respect that you would condescend to come south.

<h3>19th Route Army Concentrates in Gutian and Yanping; No Changes in the Pucheng Area; Liu's Division Still Stationed in Jian'ou for Original Defense; Cai Tingkai Arrives in Zhangzhou to Inspect Officer Training Class</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to the Naval Department, the Central government sent planes to Fujian on the 11th to scout. The 19th Route Army was confirmed to be in Gutian, there were more than 2,000 bandits in Yanping, and there were also bandits in Longyan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Jiangshan telegraphed late on the 12th that the Zhejiang border was peaceful. There were no changes in Pucheng, Zhenghe, Songxi, Jianyang, and Jian'ou in northern Fujian.

<p>(Hangzhou) Provincial Committee member Yang Mianzhong reported that the Fujian side had a tendency to act rashly. The defense area of Yanping had been handed over to the Communist army.

The center of the Fujian side's military situation should be in northern Fujian, or entering Zhejiang from Jian'ou and Pucheng. Therefore, Liu's division is very important. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Although the Fujian government is trying to find a political solution, it is still engaged in military preparations to prevent attacks by the Central Army on Fuzhou. Two divisions of the 19th Route Army, about 20,000 men, have arrived in Yanping from the Guangdong border, guarding the villages and small mountains between Yanping and Jian'ou in the north. Another large detachment was sent to Gutian. Although Chen Youren denied that the 19th Route Army had incorporated Red soldiers, there are still many of Zhu De's old troops among them. The Red soldiers and the 19th Route Army wear the same uniforms, but they can be distinguished by their long pointed hats. The Communist Party emblem of a red cross on the hat has been removed. These people are not organized into teams, but are scattered in various armies. There do not seem to be any Red Army officers in the army. Fuzhou's defenses against sea attacks are very weak. When the Nanchang ships sailed to Sandu Ao from here, they dismantled the breeches of the large cannons in the forts at the mouth of the Min River and the torpedo tubes. Although field guns of the 19th Route Army are now placed in the forts, their strength is not enough to resist a fierce bombardment from the sea. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Prepares to Relinquish Office for Recuperation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin was elected by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Congress in December of the 19th year. According to the provisions of the National Government Organization Law, the chairman's term of office is two years and may be re-elected once. Chairman Lin has announced to all departments that his current term of office has ended, and the Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to be held on the 20th of this month, so he has ordered all departments to rush to draft a general report on the work of the Plenary Session and handle the closing procedures in preparation for the Fourth Plenary Session to elect a new chairman and relieve him of his responsibilities. Among the Central Committee members, there is much discussion about continuing to support Mr. Lin because of his age and virtue. However, Lin himself decided to retreat far away because of his advanced age, failing energy, and extreme grief over the Fujian incident. This would both free up the chairmanship to help unite opinions within the party, and give himself the opportunity for long-term recuperation. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of National Salt Affairs; A Comprehensive Plan is Being Prepared</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese forcibly occupied salt affairs agencies in the three eastern provinces in March of the 21st year, all salt tax revenues in the three provinces, including foreign debt amortization, were intercepted, resulting in annual losses of 33 million yuan. In the 21st year, the total national revenue from salt taxes reached 157.212 million yuan. Since the September 18th Incident, 363,700 square miles of land and a population of 30 million have been lost, resulting in a reduction of 3.6 million dan in national salt sales and a direct loss of 33 million yuan in tax revenue. The stagnation of the national economy and the operation of the salt industry have been greatly affected. Therefore, indirect losses are difficult to estimate. The key points of the Salt Affairs Department's comprehensive plan to reorganize national salt affairs are as follows: 1. The national salt affairs are currently divided into eleven administrative regions, which are concurrently handled by the audit agencies. The merger of these agencies not only weakens anti-smuggling efforts, but also saves expenses. 2. Reorganization of tax rates: The tax rates vary from place to place, which can easily lead to dumping and facilitate smuggling. After reorganization, the disparity between high and low tax rates will not be as great as before, and it will gradually be unified to facilitate the effect of collecting taxes on the spot. 3. The number of sales stations, anti-smuggling and administrative agencies will be reduced on schedule, which will reduce expenses. In the past, the net surplus of salt tax was remitted by the Salt Affairs Audit Office to the Ministry of Finance, usually only a little over one million yuan, and at most no more than two million yuan. Since the reorganization by the former Minister of Finance, monthly remittances to the Ministry of Finance have reached 5 million yuan, and the preparation fee has been collected since mid-September, collected at a rate of ten cents per ticket of salt transportation, specifically for the construction of salt warehouses and subsidies to the poor sailing workers in Twelve Sluices, which can collect about 100,000 yuan per month. In the future, when the new plan is implemented, income will inevitably increase. The most notable national salt producing areas are Changlu, southern Sichuan, Shandong, and northern Huai. The national salt production last year was as follows (unit: dan): 1. Changlu 4,439,000; 2. Southern Sichuan 4,443,000; 3. Northern Huai 7,565,000; 4. Shandong 7,569,000; 5. Hedong 891,000; 6. Northern Kou 207,000; 7. Northern Jin 194,000; 8. Yangzhou 609,000; 9. Songjiang 188,000; 10. Both Zhejiang 4,222,000; 11. Fujian 1,002,000; 12. Guangdong 3,967,000; 13. Yunnan 488,000; 14. Northern Sichuan 1,447,000; 15. Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, totaling 162,000; Total 37,504,000 dan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huainan Coal Production is Excellent; Railway from Mine to Hefei Section to Begin Construction</h3>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: Analysis of the US Great Navy Policy Shu—The Development of Military Industry</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Roosevelt took office as President of the United States, he has used every method to overcome the economic panic. The so-called Renaissance Finance Company, the Industrial Renaissance Act, and the Brain Trust are all measures to stabilize people's hearts and consolidate society. However, after a year of effort, most of the efforts have been multiplied, and the results are less than half. The so-called Blue Demon Movement, specifically speaking, is the transformation of industrial organizations, the relief of rural panic, the rise of civil engineering, and the reorganization of financial institutions. These four are the four pillars of the United States of America to overcome the economic panic. Judging from the results, they are still in progress and are not easy to make an affirmative judgment. However, the United States has both abundant natural resources and the technical training of capitalism for nearly a hundred years. Therefore, in the process of the world economic panic, it still has the remaining strength to barely support it. If Mr. Roosevelt had taken office and there had been no Blue Eagle Movement to play a role in the industrial world, it is feared that the value of currency would become more and more high, general prices would become lower and lower, and the unemployed population would be impossible to help. However, this movement wants to achieve the full effect of stabilizing society and people's hearts, but there is no grasp. In addition to this, only expanding the market overseas and seizing colonies is enough to solve the economic panic. However, the world's land area is limited, and the distribution of spheres of influence has been determined, and the tariff war has been revived, and the issue of arms reduction has been shelved again due to Germany's obstinacy. Therefore, for today's plan, there is no good way to rebuild peace except by using troops.</p>
<p>Now there is a strategy, which Japan has implemented effectively. Although it may not be considered to have overcome the difficulties, it can temporarily maintain the status quo. What is this strategy? It is to expand the military industry. Japan was originally a light industrial country. In terms of iron, steel, oil, and other mineral products, it is not enough to compare with other powers. However, it has taken advantage of the name of extraordinary times to vigorously expand the budget. Military expenditure accounted for more than 40% of the total national expenditure in 1933. In addition to direct government management and manufacturing, the military industry also indirectly subsidizes private factories related to military industry. As a result, the domestic industries in Japan are withering, while the military industry is thriving. After the recent implementation of the so-called Second Naval Supplementary Shipbuilding Plan, shipbuilding, steelmaking, and other related industries will inevitably be stimulated. The market is prosperous, and the prosperity of the military industry has had a good impact. The United States has learned from this. First, it deeply feels that the naval strength, in addition to main battleships, such as destroyers, is only similar to Japan. Submarines, light cruisers, etc., are behind Japan. Once something happens in the Pacific, the United States will not be able to maintain its commercial shipping, and the Far East market may be seized by others. Second, the United States deeply knows that in recent years, Japan has led to the activation of the industrial sector due to the expansion of the military industry. Moreover, the United States Navy is restricted by the London Naval Treaty, and it is still short of 101 ships in terms of number and more than 204,000 tons in terms of tonnage. Therefore, there is still more room for the United States to build 37 ships. If this is used to achieve economic balance and increase the consolidation of national defense, wouldn't it be very good? The purpose of the United States is here.</p>
<p>This naval competition was able to temporarily ease the situation when the Pacific situation was not very urgent since the September 18th Incident, and the United States was able to barely maintain its gold standard system. Now the United States is not only calling on the whole country to revitalize industry and increase wages, but also will take a pure consumer military industry expansion policy to make up for the inadequacy of the industrial recovery plan, to excite the excessively declining hearts of the people, and to show Japan the color, indicating that the United States is not completely without strength, and secretly satirizing Japan not to be too military risky. However, the situation in the Far East has been determined, and the war is ultimately inevitable. The US great naval policy may ultimately stir up greater waves.</p>

<h3>Sichuanese People Unable to Bear Harsh Taxes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A petitioner from Sichuan stated that in the Wenjiang area of Chengdu, within Deng Xihou's defense zone, taxes have been pre-collected up to the 70th year of the Republic. Collections occur monthly, or twice a month. Families with one or two hundred mu of land are completely bankrupt. Even those who have not yet gone bankrupt are subjected to unbearable demands, forcing them to abandon their property and flee far away to seek refuge. Therefore, Sichuan is now experiencing a paradoxical situation of deserted fields on one side and roads filled with refugees on the other. This truly creates opportunities for the Communists.

<h3>Avenol Defends the League of Nations in London = The Quest for Arms Equality Has Created the Current Tension = Abandoning the Covenant Will Reverse the Progress of All Humanity = Henderson's Speech Criticizes French Policy = European Politicians Engage in Frequent Diplomatic Contacts =</h3>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol issued a defense of the League of Nations during a reception held by the British government in the House of Commons today. The statement, 2,000 words long, largely echoed the former British Foreign Secretary Balfour's assertion that if the League of Nations did not exist, we would have to create it. Attendees at the reception included members of parliament and figures such as Lord Cecil. Avenol acknowledged that it was not easy to gain confidence in the League of Nations because most countries do not trust the League's ability to effectively handle current major problems. The demand for arms equality is the root cause of the tense situation, but the League of Nations Covenant never mentioned equality. Some say that the League of Nations organization should be modified so that treaties can be revised accordingly, but no concrete proposals for such modifications have been put forward. The majority of the world's people still support the League of Nations. What must be understood is that the two things the world must choose between today are not the League of Nations and another better international organization, but the League of Nations and a completely lawless system. The only practical way to modify or improve the League of Nations Covenant must come from within. Abandoning the Covenant will reverse the progress of all humanity and plunge us into an era beyond calculation. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government invited League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to lunch, with many important figures in attendance, demonstrating Britain's emphasis on the Secretary-General and the League of Nations. Yesterday morning, Avenol met with Under-Secretary Eden, and after the luncheon in the House of Commons, he also spoke with Foreign Secretary Simon. The content of their discussions remains shrouded in secrecy, but it is believed that these talks were preliminary in nature, and the British government seems to want to request that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini submit clear and concrete proposals for the reorganization of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with Foreign Secretary Simon again this morning for further discussions. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons held an informal meeting and invited League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to speak. Afterward, Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, also delivered a speech. Henderson's speech has been widely commented on. The Paris (Baobao) correspondent in London provided an accurate report of Henderson's speech, stating that while the correspondent had not seen the transcripts of the meeting, according to members of the House of Commons present at the time, Henderson seemed to criticize the policies adopted by successive French cabinets in Geneva, stating that the frequent instability of the French cabinet was one of the main reasons for the failure of the Disarmament Conference. Henderson also seemed to say that he had long been in agreement with former German Chancellor Brüning, and if his ideas had been followed, an agreement with Germany would have been reached some time ago. Henderson even stated that when Germany joined the League of Nations, various countries formally allowed for the possibility of future concessions regarding arms limitation clauses, but these promises have now been rejected. Henderson also seemed to say that it was not surprising that the German Nazi Party had come to power. The (Daily Express) believes that Henderson's declaration made a great impression, and it is feared that this matter will inevitably be brought up for discussion in the House of Commons. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The frequent comings and goings of diplomats in London are evidence that the rumors of rapid exchanges of views on disarmament and issues affecting the League of Nations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are credible. Avenol continued his talks with Foreign Secretary Simon at the Foreign Office today. British Ambassador to France, Sir George Clerk, having sought clarification on the government's views on various matters, departed for Paris today. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>The Little Entente Opposes Revising Treaties = Will Not Relinquish An Inch of Territory = Results of Meeting Between Romanian and Czech Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>The talks between Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu in Gastein ended on Monday night. Beneš will depart for Paris to formally meet with French Foreign Minister Boncour, while Titulescu will go to St. Moritz. The original intention of the two foreign ministers' meeting was only to exchange views, but two major events—(1) The fact that British members of parliament were moved by the recent visit and speeches in Britain by Hungarian politician Bethlen, and 100 members signed a petition requesting treaty revisions; (2) The Italian Fascist Congress advocating the reform of the League of Nations—gave their meeting greater international significance than originally planned. After the meeting, the two foreign ministers issued a communique, announcing that they had held three lengthy talks and both believed that the current structure of the League of Nations was absolutely inviolable. Therefore, the result of the Gastein meeting was to confirm the Little Entente's opposition to treaty revisions, which is Titulescu's constant slogan (revisionism means war). After receiving approval from Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić, the Permanent Committee of the Little Entente will convene in Aragem in January of next year. (National News dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>When Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu met here, thousands of people gathered outside to express their welcome and solidarity with the Little Entente countries. The two foreign ministers appeared on the balcony to thank the crowd, stating that the Little Entente had become a political reality and would soon become an economic unity. In fact, the three countries were already psychologically bound together. The aspirations of the peoples of the three countries were to maintain peace, but if anyone violated the territorial integrity of the three countries, they were prepared to defend themselves by force. Titulescu then declared to the press: "Revising treaties is impossible. The Little Entente countries will not relinquish an inch of territory. This determination has been repeatedly expressed. All propaganda advocating treaty revisions is illegal and dangerous. The current borders of Central Europe are the result of centuries of evolution and are already decided cases. Foreign demands to revise peace treaties are not only illegal but also hostile acts, as they interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Revising treaties is tantamount to war, but we hope to maintain peace, and therefore we oppose treaty revisions." (Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<h3>Germany Demands Return of the Saar and Expansion of the Army from France</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that talks between British Ambassador to France Sir George Clerk and British cabinet members in recent days have focused on Germany's attitude towards disarmament and Chancellor Hitler's proposals to the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet. Hitler proposed negotiations with France to return the Saar region to Germany without holding the plebiscite scheduled for 1935. At the same time, Germany demanded the right to have an army of 300,000 men, but only with nine to twelve months of training. Germany would also be allowed to possess defensive weapons, but only to gradually equip them. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, these proposals do not seem to provide a basis for expanding disarmament talks between France and Germany. The French Foreign Ministry does not believe that Hitler made proposals of a substantive nature. It is heard that Hitler's proposals are not highly regarded by France and are not something France can decide on alone. France has made it clear that it cannot discuss or reach an agreement on the Saar issue, as this matter must be left to the League of Nations to resolve. People in Paris largely believe that Germany's rearmament has already reached the level proposed by Hitler, which is why Germany resolutely refuses to inspect or monitor armaments.

<h3>British Government Pays Attention to Reorganization Proposal</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons today that the Italian Fascist Party Congress passed a proposal to reorganize the League of Nations. The Italian government has not yet formally notified the British government of this matter. The British government is paying attention to this matter and is cautious, but he cannot yet say whether he will issue a public statement. Simon also said that the decisions of the Fascist Party Congress should only be seen as a step towards opening discussions. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<h3>Poison Is Sold Privately on the American Continent, Originating in Japan = The League of Nations Convention on Restriction of Manufacturing = Japan Will Approve with Reservations</h3>
<p>▲Washington dispatch: Anslinger, Director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, recently submitted his annual report to the government for publication. It clearly stated that the base for the private sale of narcotics eroding the lives of American citizens is in Japan. Recently, Japanese merchants have been actively selling internal narcotics to the American continent, which is seen as a threat by both the American and Canadian governments. Morphine smuggling is particularly prevalent in the Pacific coastal states and Hawaii, entirely distributed by Japanese hands to various places, and then sold to various households by local Japanese merchants. Most of the morphine recently confiscated in the Pacific coastal states was smuggled directly from Japan by ship. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the handling of treaties on the manufacture of narcotics and the restriction and control of their distribution, which are to be supervised by the League of Nations, the result of the deliberations by the Privy Council Examination Committee is that, although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, in order to safeguard its future rights, it may still participate in the necessary mechanisms for implementing this treaty with a declared reservation approval. It has been decided that when the Japanese government submits international treaties that are subject to the League of Nations for approval, it must also declare that it will pay reservations in dealing with the narcotics treaty in order to secure its future rights.

<h3>Japan Studies Countermeasures to Cope with the 1935 Crisis = Dissatisfied with Current Naval Ratios = Prevents Countries from Raising the Manchurian Issue Again</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Dongbao, the joint conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries, chaired by Foreign Minister Hirota, is studying countermeasures for the 1935 Disarmament Conference. It is reported that the opinions of the three ministries are largely consistent. The outline of what has been reported is as follows: (1) The 1935 conference is a conference stipulated by the London Naval Treaty. The agenda of the conference must be limited to naval issues. The disarmament proposal proposed by Japan in Geneva is now considered unsatisfactory by Japan itself and will not be raised again, but will be treated as waste paper. If the UK and the US raise it again, it will be opposed. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must observe the situation in various countries and, if necessary, notify the countries in advance. (2) If the Manchurian problem is not allowed to be discussed at this conference, the countries must be notified in advance to prevent them from raising the old issue again. Japan believes that the Manchurian problem has been resolved after withdrawing from the League of Nations. (China News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Lineup of the Naval Garrison Squadrons</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy implemented the Garrison Squadron Order yesterday and appointed the commanders of the Garrison Squadrons. The composition is as follows: (Yokosuka Garrison Squadron) Yamashiro, Kiso, Hosho, Yakumo, Kitakami, 3rd Destroyer Division, 7th Destroyer Division, 8th Destroyer Division, 6th Submarine Division, 9th Submarine Division; (Kure Garrison Squadron) Nachi, Kako, Myoko, Abu, Tsushima, 13th Destroyer Division, 16th Destroyer Division, 19th Destroyer Division, 20th Destroyer Division, 18th Submarine Division, Auxiliary Ship Asahi; (Sasebo Garrison Squadron) Tatsuta, Ashigara, Yubari, Kaga, 21st Destroyer Division, 22nd Destroyer Division, 27th Submarine Division, 28th Submarine Division, Transport Ship Notoro, Same Hayatomo.

<h3>Plans to Improve Transportation Between Japan and Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the completion of the Second Replenishment Plan, the Navy believes that the rich products of Manchuria must be supplied to Japan. Therefore, completing the transportation route across the Sea of Japan is an important preparation for dealing with the 1936 crisis. Therefore, it is currently under study. This transportation route is to develop Tsuruga, Fushiki, Niigata, and the Tsugaru Strait to connect with Rajin and Changchun. The shortest route connecting Niigata with Manchuria and Japan, the time required between Niigata and Changchun is 39 hours, which is 9 hours shorter than via Shimonoseki, 7 hours shorter than via Tsuruga, and 5 hours shorter than via Fushiki. Also, the land in Fushiki is suitable for building factories, so Manchurian products can be quickly transported there, manufactured there, and then distributed to Japan. As for Tsuruga, which has military-related factories, trade can be greatly developed because it controls the Kansai trade area. Also, the Tsugaru Strait is a route through which the United States travels to China and other places, and there are definite hopes for development in the future. Therefore, establishing a new port in the Tsugaru Strait as the gateway from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan is the most important thing. In addition to the land route, a new air route must be established, as the current air route through Korea requires an overnight stay in the middle, which is very inconvenient. If passing through Niigata, it would only take ten hours to reach Tokyo from Changchun. Therefore, improving the transportation route across the Sea of Japan is indeed necessary for national defense and economic reasons. (Electric News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Military Faction Recommends Saito Hiroshi as Ambassador to the US</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry considers the position of Ambassador to the United States to be very important. If the policy towards the US fails, Japan's position in the 1935-36 world conferences will be even more difficult. The Army will recommend Saito Hiroshi, Minister to the Netherlands, for this position. Minister Saito has a reputation as a "hardliner" within the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and is known as part of a group comprised of the former Chief of Intelligence Shiratori and Director of the Asian Bureau Tani, members of the military faction within the Foreign Ministry. Saito was born in Niigata Prefecture in 1886. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University in 1910 and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1923, he served as Consul General in New York, and has held positions such as Minister to Czechoslovakia, Chief of Intelligence, staff member at the London Conference, Counselor at the British Embassy, and Minister to the Netherlands. He is 48 years old this year, three years older than Shiratori. (China News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Government Encourages Immigration to the Far East = Farmers are Exempt from Grain Taxes = Soldiers and Workers Receive Increased Salaries</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government recently ordered an increase in the salaries of Soviet Russian soldiers and workers in the Far East by 10 to 30 percent. At the same time, it exempted farmers in the Far East from the compulsory delivery of grain for five to ten years, causing a surge in immigration to the Far East. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Aborigines Continue to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Taipei: On the 15th of last month, over forty aborigines from the Taktok tribe in the Daizhu area of the Lilong sub-district of Hualien Port, Taiwan, killed a Japanese policeman named Koasakari and his four children, seized firearms and ammunition, and fled into the mountains. Eighteen of them were recently arrested by the Japanese police, but the others are still resisting together in the mountains. The Japanese police dispatched a large force to encircle and suppress them. However, neighboring aboriginal tribes such as Shinban and Junnu, hearing the news, rose up in succession, built artillery forts, and prepared to resist the Japanese, declaring that they would kill all Japanese soldiers they saw.

<h3>The Pan American Union's Cooperation with the League of Nations = To Be Discussed at the Next General Assembly</h3>
<p>Montevideo: It is heard that US Secretary of State Hull will ask the Pan American Conference tomorrow to adopt a proposal to convene a Pan American Economic Conference in 1934, as proposed by Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas. As for the issue of closer cooperation between the Pan American Union and the League of Nations, it was decided today by a subcommittee meeting to leave it for discussion at the next General Assembly. This action was proposed by US Secretary of State Hull and seconded by five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, and Bolivia. The reason given was that the League of Nations had not formally applied to the Pan American Union for cooperation, nor had it sent representatives or observers to attend. This matter was originally proposed solely by Uruguay. (National News dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Regarding Mandated Pacific Islands, Japan is Determined to Possess them Permanently = Even if the League of Nations Is Weak and Does Not Reclaim them, the United States May Not Remain Silent</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, it was learned from reliable sources that after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1935, the League of Nations will not take any further action regarding the Pacific islands mandated to it, unless the United States protests. This is because the covenant has not prohibited non-member states from administering former German territories. According to Japanese personnel stationed in Geneva, Japan will retain the islands regardless of whether the League of Nations protests. The reason is that the islands were granted to Japan by the Allied and Associated Powers at the Versailles Peace Conference, so the League of Nations has no right to reclaim them. However, it is anticipated that the United States may not adopt the same attitude as the League of Nations and Japan. The United States is also one of the Allied Powers and can protest Japan's continued administration of the islands after withdrawing from the League of Nations. The United States pays the most attention to the Pacific islands among the Allied Powers because, in the event of a war between Japan and Russia, Japan can use these islands to cut off the traffic between the United States and the Philippines. However, the United States' attitude will still depend on whether Japan has plans to establish fortifications on the islands after withdrawing from the League of Nations. If Japan does so, Washington will protest. (National News dispatch from the 12th)</p>

It is said that China does not intend to submit any proposals at next year's labor conference, and hopes to obtain a term for the election of six directors. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing to Discuss Traffic and Customs Issues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, left Beijing for Shanghai by night train on the 12th. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 11th and waited to meet Gu Mengyu to report on the administration of the Beining Railway. Yin told reporters on the morning of the 12th that he had drafted several principles for opening the Beining Railway to traffic and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for review. Previously, negotiations were temporarily suspended due to the lack of agreement on the other party's opinions and various difficulties. The Beining Railway has been built for more than fifty years, with about one-third of the route inside the customs and two-thirds outside the customs. On average, passengers account for one-third and freight accounts for one-third. The railway has been in disrepair for many years, the equipment is simple, and the Luanhe Railway Bridge has long exceeded its insurance period and is quite dangerous. The platforms at the stations along the line are too short, there is a lack of warehouses, and there is no Han Railway Hospital, which urgently needs to be established. Currently, the total monthly income of the railway is about one million yuan, which, after deducting employee salaries, railway debts, and remittances to the Beiping Military Branch for subsidies, leaves little surplus. (Central News Agency, 11th) (Nanjing) Yin Tong also expressed his personal feelings that Chinese people only know how to sing high-pitched tunes and act pretentious, regardless of reality. Since the Incident of September 18th, our country has been singing high-pitched tunes beyond its capabilities, making mistakes again and again, resulting in three mistakes, and ultimately signing the Tanggu Agreement. If we could act according to our capabilities and be pragmatic, why would we completely lose the entire Northeast. The same is true for the various issues of opening traffic and establishing customs. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past, and we must recover one point for every point we can recover, and one foot for every foot we can recover. Recovering one point and one foot will increase our strength by one point and one foot. If we continue to be obsessed with this, the Northeast will never be recovered. He also used a wonderful metaphor for those who oppose opening traffic and mail, believing that it is abandoning the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast: "It is like A having a daughter who is abducted by a robber. A does not try to rescue her, but refuses to recognize her because his daughter has lost her virginity and tainted the family reputation. This is truly unreasonable. The compatriots outside the customs are looking forward to the motherland's rescue every day, but they are completely cut off. This is unbelievable." Yin sighed incessantly. The issue of postal communication has the same reasons as the issue of opening traffic. The people inside the customs consider the Northeast as their hometown, and who doesn't have parents, brothers, wives, and children? Since the suspension of postal communication, it has been impossible to communicate news with their hometowns. The compatriots outside the customs, after being ruled by the violent Japanese, have also been cut off from communication with the interior, and looking to the motherland is like being in another world. What pain is greater than this? However, Japanese and puppet communications are not affected at all. They have already established post offices in Duolun to transmit mail between the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, and are in contact with the puppet post offices in Gubeikou and Yuguan. At the same time, they are also using the method of the interior post offices continuing to send mail on the South Manchuria Railway, so the issue of postal communication must be resolved formally as soon as possible. I have discussed this in detail with Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, and after presenting the urgency of the matter, we are still waiting for a proper solution. The general trend in the future is that we will adopt the method of subsidizing the postage by the recipient, but this needs to be specifically decided by the Ministry of Communications. In short, after September 18th, communication between inside and outside the customs has continued without interruption in terms of telecommunications, but postal communication has been completely cut off, which seems thorough but is not thorough. In name, it is unreasonable, and in fact, it is only misleading ourselves. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, intends to submit a traffic plan to Wang and Gu for approval. It is rumored that Wang will submit the proposal to the five ministries of Communications, Railways, Foreign Affairs, Judicial Administration to discuss the principle and review together. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Yin Tong and inquired about issues such as the opening of the Beining Railway to traffic. According to him, he had negotiated with the Japanese representatives on several occasions, and had reached the point where the Beining Railway could extend beyond the customs, and the puppet Fengshan Railway vehicles entering the customs should all be changed to the Beining logo. Other ticketing methods had also been discussed to a considerable extent. Subsequently, an order was received from the central government to stop negotiations, so the issue of opening traffic was temporarily suspended. He had also drafted several methods for the issue of opening traffic and submitted them to the central government for review. Once approved by the central government, he would follow the instructions to implement them. Since the governments of the Northeast provinces have not been considered foreign lands, the people of the East provinces are still citizens of the Republic of China. The issue of opening traffic must be realized to facilitate the transportation of compatriots outside the customs. As for the reception of various passes of the Great Wall, it is currently suspended due to an order from the central government. How it will proceed will be in accordance with the orders of the central government. He believes that it is very important to establish customs at the passes of the prepared cities, because our country has not abandoned the land outside the customs, and the people are still engaged in commerce. Establishing customs checkpoints and collecting tax rates to increase financial revenue can be implemented within the principle of not losing power. The central government is currently drafting detailed methods for this, and it should be realized soon. The Japanese are building barracks in Dongluocheng, returning the area to the Suizhong County and organizing a county government. They are also building roads. Since the area is located outside the customs, our country's administrative power cannot reach it, which is very painful. This time, in addition to reporting on matters in North China to Premier Wang, there are several points regarding bureau affairs that need to be reported and discussed with the Ministry of Railways.

<h3>Yan Huiqing Goes to Europe to Meet with Ambassadors Gu and Guo</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing left Moscow for Berlin on the 8th of this month, and left Berlin for London on the 12th to meet with Ambassador Guo Taiqi to the UK. He also plans to visit Ambassador Gu Weijun to France in Paris. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Ambassador Yan telegraphed the Ministry from Moscow before his departure, only stating the date of departure and the destination, without explaining the mission. However, according to his own speculation, Ambassador Yan's trip from Russia to various countries in Western Europe is likely to be of a touring nature. It is rumored that Ambassador Yan will return to China, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Gan Yun Arrives in Jiangxi to Report on the Current Situation of the Fujian Rebellion</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Gan Yun, the former party secretary of Fujian, fled Fujian and came to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the current situation of the Fujian rebellion. According to what he told reporters, the organization of the Fujian government is extremely complex, the financial situation is chaotic, many shops have closed down, and residents are startled several times a night. The rebels refuse to use central government banknotes and have illegally printed 20 million yuan of counterfeit government banknotes in Hong Kong. As for the forces currently claimed by the puppet government, they are only claiming to have four divisions. The 19th Route Army, after the various battles of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits, only has three regiments and one battalion left, stationed around Fuzhou and Mawei. The others that have been incorporated are mostly a rabble and are not worth fighting. The 49th Division of Zhang Zhen, formerly stationed in southern Fujian, has extremely poor discipline. After being incorporated into the 19th Route Army, the people are even more unbearable. Recently, there has been a folk song that says, "The 49th changed to the 19th, the people have nowhere to go," which shows a glimpse of the people's suffering and displacement. Before I left Fuzhou, Chen and others had claimed to have rebelled for many days, but the hat badges of the 19th Route Army were still the Blue Sky and White Sun, which is even more proof of the complexity and chaos within it. The soldiers are like they are in a fog, not understanding what is going on, suspicion is rampant, and everyone has different ambitions. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>

<h3>TASS Formally Denies the New Soviet Secret Treaty</h3>

This policy is well known. Therefore, the Morning Post's report on the fictitious agreement is clearly a provocative fabrication. (TASS, 11th)</p>

<h3>Spain: Slight Turn in the Situation; Socialist Party Rejects General Strike; Fascism to be Implemented Soon; Government Troops Suppress Riots in Disturbed Areas; Insurgent Uprisings Still Occurring Intermittently</h3>
<p>Madrid: The political situation in Spain has taken a slight turn. The Socialist Party has refused to support the general strike initiated by the anarchist party, believing that such action would only be exploited by right-wing parties. The authorities now hope that the disturbed areas will soon return to normal. Many believe that the implementation of fascism in Spain is imminent. There was still bloodshed in the disturbed areas today. Two infantry platoons and one militia detachment departed from Valencia, killing two rioters during the suppression of unrest in Teruel, and three militiamen were injured. As government troops were deployed, rioters threw hand grenades, but were driven back by government forces, allowing the troops to advance. Valterrauls declared a Soviet regime, where anarchists killed one militiaman and imprisoned the rest. Troops have now been dispatched from Tarragona to suppress the unrest. Gunfire continued in San Sebastián this morning. A squadron of the cruiser "Fierro" has been ordered to stand by, ready to be deployed to the disturbed areas. Algeciras has declared a general strike, with all ships and trains suspended, cutting off transportation between Spain and Gibraltar. Railway workers in southern Andalusia have also declared a general strike. The express train from Madrid to Seville was stopped today in Los Rosales because local railway staff neglected the train to protest the authorities' arrest of railway workers. The Minister of Interior, fearing a strike by bakery owners in Madrid, has issued a public notice stating that the unrest is gradually subsiding and there is no need to panic. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>No Change in US Monetary Policy; Treasury Secretary Denies Rumors; Senator Pittman's Views on Silver Relief</h3>
<p>(New York) Acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated in Washington this afternoon that there has been no change in the Treasury Department's monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve Bank and foreign central banks were indeed in contact, he would be aware of it. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank is in contact with the Bank of England and the Bank of France to discuss a method for stabilizing currencies, and that the US government has decided on a fixed gold dollar exchange rate. Today's statement by the Acting Treasury Secretary is intended to dispel these rumors. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman stated today that unless the President takes concrete action to relieve the silver market, Congress will be filled with proposals to re-monetize silver. He intends to propose that all newly mined silver in the United States be minted into coins at a ratio of sixteen to one of silver to gold, estimating that 30 million silver dollars can be minted annually. This is a moderate inflation of currency based on sound coinage. While its effects may be slight and not seen for several years, its true value lies in other silver-producing countries following suit, allowing silver to regain its status as a global currency.

<h3>Recent Situation in Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>Foreigners Pessimistic that Shanhaiguan Will No Longer Belong to China; The Convenient Import of Narcotics into North China by Manchukuo. A Shanhaiguan dispatch, December 4, in the North China Daily News says: The Manchukuo flag is still flying high over the city of Shanhaiguan. Although there has been much talk recently about the return of Shanhaiguan to China, there have been no major changes in the situation here. The Manchukuo flag is visible everywhere. The roads to the railway station and the traffic station are still guarded by Manchukuo military police. Chinese customs authorities have no power to interfere with incoming and outgoing goods. Therefore, the city is still under the control of the Japanese (Manchukuo) authorities, just as it was in the past. Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, negotiations for the return of Shanhaiguan have begun. Not long ago, a semi-official source in Dalian announced that the Japanese army was preparing to abandon the key of Shanhaiguan and the long and dangerous line of the Great Wall, which surprised the world. At the time, the public speculated that Japan had been forced to do so by recent developments in international politics. Therefore, the true situation in Shanhaiguan should be of interest to the world, and a brief account is given below.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the city in January of this year, it has stationed a brigade of troops in the city. Recently, the number of Japanese troops occupying areas inside the pass has indeed decreased, but there is no sign that they are preparing to return Shanhaiguan. In other words, the reduction of Japanese troops is only the only sign that Manchukuo is reportedly preparing to negotiate the return of Shanhaiguan. The negotiations on the Japanese side are actually handled by representatives appointed by the Kwantung Army, that is, representatives of Manchukuo. They claim to be only dealing with representatives of the Nanjing government regarding the actual situation of negotiations in Beiping, which is extremely difficult to ascertain. However, judging from various pieces of evidence, the main obstacle to a formal return is that the Chinese authorities refuse to negotiate directly with Manchukuo. Although the Chinese authorities are willing to meet with the Japanese at the negotiating table, they are unwilling to conduct public negotiations with the Manchukuo representatives appointed by the Kwantung Army on the takeover of Shanhaiguan and the areas occupied by Japanese troops in the vicinity. At the same time, the status of Shanhaiguan is also very chaotic. Hardliners among the Japanese openly declare that Shanhaiguan is a part of Manchukuo. In fact, the administration of the city, although nominally autonomous, is indeed completely controlled by the Manchukuo authorities. The more moderate Japanese claim that Shanhaiguan is only temporarily occupied by the Japanese army and that the city is now practicing self-government. As for the so-called self-government, the administration of Shanhaiguan is now managed by Chinese officials elected by the local (citizens). These Chinese officials are all appointed by the Japanese, and the elections are merely a facade. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the administration of Shanhaiguan is truly independent. Now, the three issues of through-trains, customs duties, and postal services are being contested by both sides, and it is difficult to resolve them for a while. It is said that Manchukuo insists on opening Shanhaiguan as a free port, so that Manchukuo's drug cartels can import narcotics into North China with great convenience. A Manchukuo customs office has now been built between the railway station and the city of Shanhaiguan. It is said that Manchukuo is also planning to build housing for its customs personnel, and temporary barracks are being hastily built about one mile outside the east gate to accommodate the Kwantung Army, which is said to be able to accommodate 1,500 people. Therefore, even if Shanhaiguan is returned to China, military encroachment will remain forever. It is also rumored that the Japanese are planning to build a new city near these barracks. This news has made the Chinese and residents very uneasy, because if it is realized, it will add to the coercion. However, according to the opinions of foreigners, this is deliberately spread by the Japanese to intimidate the local Chinese, so that they will firmly oppose changing the current status of Shanhaiguan, so as to prevent the Japanese and Manchus from abandoning Shanhaiguan and building a free port opposite the city to seize the trade on which Shanhaiguan relies for its survival today. Free trade is indeed sufficient to help Shanhaiguan's development. Judging from the phenomena, the final solution to the current stalemate is to make Shanhaiguan an autonomous city, enjoying the special benefits of a free port. As for the administration, it will be presided over by the Chinese, to save the face of He and Huang of Beiping. At the same time, the Chinese customs can set up customs offices on the border of the free port to stop the source of drugs from flowing into North China. This is the general view of the Chinese and Japanese in this area, but foreigners are all pessimistic and see Shanhaiguan as never again belonging to China.</p>
<h3>Eastern Guangdong: Defensive Works Constructed Everywhere; Large Armies Gather in the Upper Reaches of the East, Han, and Liang Rivers</h3>
<p>A Shantou dispatch from Li Yangjing's military conference in Meizhou states that after the Fujian Incident, rumors spread throughout the Guangdong-Fujian border area. The counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou have been under winter defense martial law since the first of the month. Shantou police are also fully armed on patrol. After 10 p.m., there are few pedestrians on the streets. All ships entering and leaving Shantou Port are limited to between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. No traffic is allowed after that time. A Japanese warship entered and docked in the waters off Qilu on the afternoon of the 5th. Although rumors are rife in Chaozhou and Shantou, local order in the counties remains good. Trenches and fortifications are everywhere. Solid defensive works have been built on Tiger Head Mountain, where Raoping Huanggang borders Chenghai Donglong. There are pillboxes in every mountain village where Raoping borders Zhian and Pinghe, too many to count. There are also trenches in Maqian, Shangrao, and Shiyun, where Dapu borders Raoping. Guangdong troops are stationed in Yongding Fengshi and Shishang above Dapu. There are trenches everywhere in Jiaoling Wuping, Shanghang, Pingyuan, Xingning, and Xunwu. Since Commander Li Yangjing returned to defend the area, the Third Army headquarters has made many changes to the defense areas of each division at the Meizhou military conference. For example, the original two regiments of the Independent First Division, commanded by Huang Renhuan, were stationed in Shanghang. Because the terrain in that defense area was prominent, they have been withdrawn to Wuping to Yongding Fengshi, shortening the line against Fujian and preventing attacks by the Communist bandits. The Huang Zhiwen Division stationed in Jiangxi has also shortened its line due to the prominence of the defense line, establishing contact with the Huang Renhuan Division. The Huang Yanzhen Division is connected with the Huang Renhuan and Zhang Ruigui divisions. At present, large armies are gathering in the upper reaches of the East, Han, and Liang rivers, actively deploying defenses. All key passes have been dug with trenches. Trenches are everywhere in Chaoan: Zhugaoshan, Bijia, and at the foot of Phoenix Mountain. The long trench from the North Gate Gang of Meixian to Wuliting was originally dug by Jiang Guangnai when he defeated Zhu De and Mao Zedong in Meixian and has been preserved for many years. Now the original trenches have been re-repaired. The long trenches of Dalongtian, Luogang, Niudougang, Shizheng, Bachi in Pingyuan, Wuhua, Anliu, Wujingfu, Huayang, Heshi in Zijin, and Fucheng in Fengshun are the latest and greatest buildings. The trenches are lined up in Luojiayue, Tangkeng, Xinxu, and Huizhai, where Chaoan Fengshun borders. As for the official road between Fengshun and Xingning, such as Houzidong, Qingtan, Xiamuluojing, and Baxiangshan, the terrain is also used everywhere to build fortresses. The Guangdong army's deployment in the eastern region this time is more stringent than ever before. The purpose of Li Yangjing's military conference in Meizhou was to adjust the defense lines of each army and urge the construction of roads. Yang Youmin, chief of staff of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, and Li Hua, director of the Highway Bureau, went to Meixian on the 2nd. Yang returned to Shantou on the 6th, while Li stayed in Meixian. In order to urge the early completion of the second, third, fourth, and fifth arterial roads in the eastern district, Li Yangjing accompanied Li Hua and personnel from the military headquarters on an inspection tour of the second arterial road, which runs from the Meisong Road to Dapu and then into Fengshi. The second arterial road runs from Huizhou through Zijin, Wuhua, and Xingning to Songkou in Meixian and has been completed in sections. Only the section from Songkou to Dapu has not been completed. Li's arrival in Meizhou came from the second arterial road. After inspecting the second arterial road, he will inspect the third arterial road from Wuhua Anliu to Fengshun Jieyang, and then inspect the fourth arterial road from Zijin to Xingning Xichang into Pingyuan. Finally, he will inspect the fifth arterial road from Chaoan through Phoenix Mountain into Raoping City and out of Qiandong to Huanggang Zhaoan. Li's inspection is expected to reach Shantou by the end of the month and will personally order the army division commanders stationed in various places to strictly order the soldiers under their command to assist in road construction. Each arterial road is limited to holding a ceremony for the completion of contact traffic with the first arterial road on New Year's Day next January to facilitate military and commercial transportation.

<h3>Jiading: Automobiles Run Between Nanxiang and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The highway from Nanxiang to Zhenru was completed by the county Construction Bureau in the previous year, and private cars often traveled back and forth. When Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, traveled from Nanjing to Shanghai, he would take the Nanjing-Shanghai train to Nanxiang Station and then take a car to Shanghai via this road. Now, Huang Yangluo, a local resident, and Zhang Yonggao, the owner of an automobile dealership on Baoshan Road in Shanghai, have purchased two provincial highway automobile licenses from the Construction Department. They have established a second branch in Nanxiang and started a trial run of Nanxiang-Shanghai automobiles on the 10th, which proved to be very successful. Therefore, starting on the 13th, they will use two provincial highway license vehicles and ten Shanghai city license vehicles to carry passengers from Xiancha Bridge in Nanxiang to Baoshan Road in Shanghai, with six scheduled trips back and forth. The Shanghai to Nanxiang times are 7:00, 8:00, 11:30 a.m., 3:30, 4:30, and 5:30 p.m. The Nanxiang to Shanghai times are 8:00, 9:00 a.m., 1:00, 4:00, and 5:15 p.m. The fare for each passenger is 40 cents. However, local organizations believe that the road was built with county funds, but now the company is actually using two provincial highway licenses to carry passengers on scheduled trips, actually occupying the entire public road privately, and will make some kind of protest.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Robbery of Four Families in One Night</h3>
<p>It is the time of winter defense, and robberies are frequent everywhere. Last night (11th) at about 11 p.m., the home of Shan Wenzhun, the head of Shan Jiaqiao Township, Fourteen Map, outside the south gate, was suddenly broken into by more than ten robbers carrying pistols, while the family was still half-asleep. Three of the robbers threatened with pistols, while the others entered the house and robbed freely. After robbing, they went to the room of Shan Huohai (Wenzhun's uncle), who lived in the same house, broke open boxes and overturned chests, searching for clothes and ornaments. They dragged Huohai to Wenzhun's room and locked him up. The robbers then went to the Qiu family in Xiaojinjing Village, about a hundred steps south. The two households of Yonggen and A-Qiu, brothers, were robbed at the same time. Yonggen's son, A-Xiaogou, heard the alarm and jumped out of the back window to escape to the other side of the river, shouting for the arrest of the robbers. He was heard by the robbers, who shot at him, hitting A-Xiaogou. The bullet entered his back and exited his chest, and his leg was also hit by a bullet. Blood flowed like a river. He was then beaten violently with a tree branch, and A-Xiaogou fainted to the ground. The robbers then carried their loot and left. It is estimated that the four families lost a considerable amount of money. The victims reported the robbery to the police for investigation in the morning. The injured A-Xiaogou was carried to Songjiang Hospital for treatment by his family. It is not known whether his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Refugee Women Come to Songjiang to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Recently, ten young women claiming to be refugees from Jiangxi, dressed neatly, led by a man named Wang Yushan, went to the First Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau, requesting to raise funds. They said that they had suffered from banditry in Jiangxi and had left their homes to seek a living. They planned to go to Hangzhou but lacked travel expenses, and asked for assistance. The sub-station sent police to monitor them. After the refugees raised funds from merchants, they were escorted out of the area.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: A Large Number of Hostages from Zhouzhuang Escape Danger</h3>
<p>Tang, the wife of the owner of Yangjia Gang soup shop in Zhouzhuang, and her son, Tiger, as well as Ruan and Shen, the daughters-in-law of Xia Junde in nearby Lujia Gang, and their grandson, A-Xiaomao, were all kidnapped by bandits last month and held for ransom. Because the victims had no money to redeem the tickets, there was no way out. The bandits hid the hostages at the bottom of the bandit boat for more than ten days. The day before yesterday (11th), the bandit boat was parked overnight on the shore of Cheng Lake. In the middle of the night, while the bandits were sound asleep, all the hostages except the small hostage, Tiger, who was fast asleep and did not wake up, took the opportunity to go ashore and escape. Yesterday (12th), they escaped back to their homes in Zhouzhuang Township. The public security bureau questioned the hostages, asking them about their kidnapping and escape.</p>
<h3>Minister Luo Inspects Prisons and Penitentiaries</h3>
<p>Minister of Justice Luo Wengan came to Suzhou to inspect the judiciary. After inspecting the High Court and the Third Prison on the (11th), he went to the Railway Hotel to rest because it was already dusk. Yesterday (12th), he continued to inspect the District Court, the Third Prison, and the Penitentiary. He is scheduled to leave Suzhou by train at 9:50 this morning (13th) to go to Wuxi, and then to Zhenjiang and Yangzhou for inspections.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Caught in Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Qiu Jiusheng, the director in charge of collecting tobacco and alcohol taxes in the three counties of Wuxi, Changshu, and Jiangyin, has been repeatedly accused of wrongdoing. After the General Taxation Department sent personnel to investigate, they found that Qiu had indeed embezzled funds. He was immediately dismissed from his post and handed over to the Wuxi County Government for detention. His vacancy was filled by Qin Jianyuan, a native of Wuxi, who took over the job the day before yesterday. Qin is the son of Qin Yuzhao, the former magistrate of Wuxi County, and was previously the secretary of the Zhongnan Bank.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Gu Renfa Secretly Investigates in Nantong</h3>
<p>Two visitors from Zhenjiang arrived at the Youfei Hotel in Chengnan on the 10th. In the guest register, they wrote that their names were Gu Minyu, 36 years old from Guangdong, and Zhao Yuxin, 30 years old from Henan. Both said they were visiting friends in Nantong and brought two Shandong servants with them. The hotel asked for a guarantor, so they filled in Fu Qianzhi, who is said to be the new director of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau. However, he has not yet taken office and is staying at the club. The Public Security Bureau's supervisory office checked the rooms in the evening and especially instructed that Gu and Zhao were from the province and should be kept secret. Therefore, it is rumored that Gu Minyu is an alias for Gu Renfa. Gu's actions are extremely secretive, and he refuses to see visitors. He went out early in the morning on the 11th, and it is not known where he went. At 6 p.m., Zhao Yuxin borrowed two plainclothes armed patrol officers, Jiang Zhiping and others, from the urban public security branch, and accompanied them to Chuan Gang on the border of Tonghai in a car, saying they were handling a case.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: The Department Orders Strict Investigation of Overcharges for Construction Donations</h3>
<p>Meat merchants' representatives Zhang Zhongdao and Wu Wenyuan of Wuyi have repeatedly filed complaints with the Provincial Department, accusing Qiu Youhe, Zhang Xuanxin, and others of embezzling construction special donations collected from slaughter taxes, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. The Provincial Department has repeatedly ordered the county to investigate, but former County Magistrate Zhang's reply seemed to indicate a misunderstanding. Since the reorganization of the Provincial Government, Zhang Zhongdao and others have again filed a complaint with the Provincial Government, attaching certificates and other evidence, requesting that a fair and competent person be quickly selected to supervise the meat merchants, adjust and verify the accounts, and strictly pursue and limit the payment. The Financial and Construction Departments have jointly ordered a strict investigation. The Construction Department has sent Chen Heng'an and the Finance Department has sent Lu Fengtai, the director of the Wujin business tax bureau, to the county government to take the case files filed by Zhang Zhongdao and others, collect the slaughter tax collection records and special construction donations accounts for the past years, and summon the original defendants and witnesses to the county for a thorough investigation. If the accusations are found to be true, the defendants will be detained by the county government to recover the money. Chen Heng'an and others arrived in Changzhou on the 12th and are working with County Magistrate Cai and Lu Fengtai to investigate the truth of the case before submitting a report.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Headquarters Order: No Visits to Forts Allowed</h3>
<p>The General Staff Headquarters considers fortress areas to be vital to national defense and military affairs. Therefore, visits by all persons, both Chinese and foreign, should be strictly prohibited to prevent leaks that could lead to miscalculations in military operations. The General Staff Headquarters recently received a report from Staff Officer Liu Tianfu and Adjutant Xie Youan that during their inspection of Jiangyin, personnel from other organizations were observed visiting the newly built forts. The General Staff Headquarters specifically ordered Commander Xie that the fortress area should be implemented in accordance with the Law on Fortress and Fortified Zone Areas. Regardless of whether the buildings are new or old, visits by the public are prohibited. Even if local officials and gentry request visits, they should be handled in accordance with the Area Law.</p>
<p>[P Yangzhou: Ministry's Response to the Yutong Relocation Case</p>
<p>The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce, due to the Yutong relocation case, together with the Agricultural Education Law Firm and the Reporters Association, jointly sent telegrams to the Provincial Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Salt Commissioner's Office, requesting a halt to the relocation. Now, in addition to receiving a provincial approval stating that the Ministry of Finance has been instructed to order the transport commissioner to strictly prohibit the relocation, the chambers of commerce were notified on the 11th that a decree was received from the Ministry of Finance on the 9th, stating in brief that the telegrams and the Salt Commissioner's Office's report to the Chamber of Commerce, etc., have been received. After investigation, the Yutong salt production area was originally located in the Chenjiagang area of northern Jiangsu. Since the transport commissioner relocated northward to reorganize the production area, he repeatedly ordered the Jinan companies to relocate their headquarters northward to facilitate local management. Yutong's relocation is being carried out in accordance with the order, but it has been reported that it was approved by a shareholders' meeting. The company's headquarters relocation has no impact on salt transport or embankment work. Other local public, charitable, educational, construction, and business donations will continue as before. The Ministry previously ordered the Huai transport commissioner to comply and informed the chambers of commerce not to worry excessively.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have recently read the Zhenjiang correspondence column in your newspaper of December 1st of this year, which stated that during the three investigations of Hua Zhen, the former magistrate of Xinghua County, the plaintiff made statements that seemed to exonerate Hua, claiming that he was taking the blame for others and requesting that the judge treat Hua leniently. After investigation, the Zhenjiang Court only summoned the plaintiff Wei Chonggeng to court for questioning once. During that hearing, Chonggeng and others made statements based on facts and did not request that the judge treat Hua leniently. Official records are available for verification. Moreover, the court has the power to weigh the severity of the case, so how could Chonggeng and others rashly make such a request? We are concerned that this is inaccurate hearsay. We respectfully request that the editor-in-chief investigate and promptly make corrections. Addressed to the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao. From: Wei Chonggeng, Director of the Xinghua County Farmers' Association; Gu Lunan, Chairman of the Xinghua County Chamber of Commerce; Pan Dejun, Standing Director of the Xinghua County Education Association; Zhao Baosen, Standing Director of the Xinghua County Fishermen's Association; Wu Guangguo, Standing Committee Member of the Xinghua County Executive Committee; Zhu Liangfu, Standing Committee Member of the Xinghua Relief Institute Foundation Committee; Zhao Liangbi, Former Standing Committee Member of the Xinghua Storage Committee. December 9th, Year 22.</p>

The people in our rear areas should also work together to promote this work. As for the rebellion in Fujian Province, the central government will be able to quell it within the shortest possible time. Recently, there have been reactionary elements and speculators who have taken the opportunity to spread rumors to confuse the public, which is hateful. The military and political organs of this city have a duty to not pardon them, and have ordered the military and police organs to strictly investigate. At this time of internal and external troubles, the Chinese people are working hard to survive. Survival requires unity of spirit, support for the central government, and consolidation of unity.

Recently, it has been found that unscrupulous people and reactionary elements are lurking in the city, spreading rumors, and attempting to incite unrest in order to carry out their conspiracies. Their intentions are evil and hateful. In addition to ordering the military and police to strictly investigate and arrest them for prosecution, all citizens must be diligent in their occupations and must not easily believe rumors or disturb each other. This proclamation is hereby issued, and everyone must comply.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Guangzhou Communist Uprising: Passed Peacefully Yesterday and the Day Before</h3>

<p>Sir Lampson was scheduled to take the Jianghai Customs special launch Jinghui wheel at 2:30 p.m. yesterday to board the Blue Funnel Line wheel. Therefore, the four weeks of the Bund Wharf were notified by the Public Concession Patrol Room from 1:00 p.m. yesterday, and the Chinese and Western detectives were sent to the wharf to take precautions and prohibit the entry and exit of vehicles. At 1:30, a small platoon of the British Army and Navy stationed in Shanghai, as well as the military band, all dressed neatly in their uniforms with guns, were arranged by their respective captains on the lawn next to the wharf. The well-wishers arrived successively at around 2:00 and stood on the lawn. All idlers and spectators were prohibited from passing through.</p>
<h3>Seeing off by All Circles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, officials from various Chinese and foreign agencies in the city, hearing that Sir would leave Shanghai in the afternoon, went to the Nanjing Road Bund wharf before 1:00.</p>

<p>The British naval authorities in the city, because Sir was about to leave Shanghai, sent a small row of naval sailors and marines to the Nanjing Road Bund lawn yesterday afternoon to be reviewed by Sir. At the same time, a small row of the British Navy military band came to play music to see Sir off back to his country.

<h3>Japanese Consul Illegally Arrests Jin Xi: Municipal Government Has Lodged Protest</h3>
<p>The Taxpayer Association sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting negotiations to the Central News Agency. Since the Korean Jin Xi, who is of Chinese nationality, was illegally arrested by the Japanese consul in the French Concession, his family has been appealing to all parties for help. In addition to hiring Lou Yunhai, Luo Zhaoxin, Xu Jie, and others to request assistance from all parties according to law, all circles in this city have also paid great attention to this matter. According to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun of the Central News Agency, Jin Xi was illegally arrested by the Japanese side, and his family came to the Municipal Government to request rescue. After investigation by this government, Jin Xi is indeed a Korean who has become naturalized as a Chinese citizen. The Japanese consul's unwarranted arrest in the French Concession is illegal. The Municipal Government has lodged a protest with the Japanese consul, and no reply has been received yet. However, according to the Japanese consul, Jin Xi is related to the Hongkou assassination case and it is difficult to expect a concrete reply in a short time. The Chinese Taxpayer Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday regarding the Jin Xi case, stating: Respectfully, it is reported that the Korean Jin Xi, who had long ago acquired Chinese nationality, was illegally kidnapped and taken away by the Japanese while living in the French Concession. The French Concession authorities allowed the Japanese to infringe upon their police power, and the French consul ignored the violation of international agreements. According to the provisions of international law, even people with dual nationality are subject to the laws of their place of residence. The French Concession is the territory of the Republic of China. Even if Jin Xi had original nationality that has not been lost, according to the agreement of international law, if there is a suspicion of crime, he should be detained and interrogated by the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. However, Jin Xi was illegally kidnapped by the Japanese, and the police power of the French Concession and the status of the French consul were trampled on. Are the residents in the French Concession at risk of being illegally kidnapped by the Japanese at any time? Is it still possible to maintain legal order? Therefore, we hereby respectfully request that the government promptly conduct serious negotiations with the consuls concerned to recover Jin Xi and restore his freedom in order to protect national sovereignty and maintain legal order in the concession. I am very grateful. This is addressed to the Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government Wu.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Telegraph Soon to Be Connected: = All Machinery Installed = = Current Work on Adjustment and Correction = = Date of Telegraph Connection to be Determined Within the Month =</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications believed that the original radio station was insufficient for Sino-British telegraph communication, so it specially built a new transmitting station next to the Zhenru International Radio Station. The entire project was completed as early as the end of August. The four large receivers, two twenty-kilowatt transmitters, and one telephone ordered from the British Marconi Company have all been shipped to Shanghai. The engineers of the station have supervised the workers to transport the four receivers to Liuhe for installation, and the two transmitters and one telephone to the Zhenru Radio Station for installation. The above projects have been completed one after another. The engineers of the station have been actively carrying out correction work and checking whether there are any errors in the installed machines.</p>
<h3>Installation of Underground Cables to be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the station, there are telephone antennas installed along the route between the Zhenru Radio Station and the radio station in the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road in the city. Fearing that the antennas will encounter difficulties in the event of wind, rain, or other unforeseen events, underground cables have been laid along the route from Zhenru to the radio station in the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road. Since the project started in October, it has been largely completed and will be fully completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Additional Motor Installed for Emergency Needs</h3>
<p>All the machines in the radio station rely on electricity to operate. The electricity required is currently supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. The amount of electricity used each month is quite large. In order to save expenses and prevent the water and electricity company from having an accident or stopping the supply of electricity, the station purchased a generator from the Construction Committee of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing and added a house next to the radio station in mid-October to install the motor. The entire project will be completed within a few days. It is also said that the power of the newly installed generator is sufficient to supply all the machines in the radio station.</p>
<h3>First Batch of American Wheat Shipped to Shanghai: Delayed Five Days Due to Heavy Fog: Total of 8,940 Tons Loaded</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat purchased on credit by our country will be imported on Sunday. It was originally scheduled to arrive at the Wusongkou on the 11th and be imported and unloaded on the 12th. Unexpectedly, there has been heavy fog on the sea for days, which has caused a delay of five days to Shanghai. The reporter of this newspaper inquired about the details yesterday, and the details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Amount Shipped</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat borrowed was started to be transported and loaded from Portland, North America on November 16 on the British ship Bank Line, which was leased by the China Merchants Bureau, which is the ship of the world-famous Bank Line. The ship set off from the United States on the 20th. The entire ship was loaded with 8,940 tons, totaling about 95,000 bags. According to the usual practice, it should arrive in Shanghai in 14 days. Therefore, the shipowner's report also confirmed that it could be imported at the latest yesterday.</p>
<h3>Encountered Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>After leaving the United States, the ship was very peaceful along the way. When it was about to reach the territory of Japan, the weather suddenly turned bad, and heavy fog fell on the ocean, making navigation very dangerous. In order to ensure safe navigation, the ship stopped sailing to avoid the fog, and anchored for four consecutive days. It was not until yesterday that the fog cleared that the shipowner telegraphed to Shanghai to start sailing, so it could not arrive in Shanghai for delivery according to the scheduled period.</p>
<h3>Imported This Week</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter inquired about the truth from a Westerner and was told the definite news that the Array Fubengk wheel could arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but it was blocked by fog and had to be postponed for five days. It will arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. However, the 8,900 tons of American wheat loaded in the ship have been sold to the Hakka people, so there is no need to unload them in the warehouse. As soon as they arrive in Shanghai on Sunday, they can be delivered from the ship's side. The owners have been notified to prepare barges for transshipment at that time.</p>
<h3>Coming One After Another</h3>
<p>The second and third batches of American wheat have also been handed over to the Stein Company to send two ships, totaling 16,000 tons. The Array Gen will transport 8,000 tons and will be imported on the 23rd of this month. The Iowa wheel will carry 8,000 tons and will arrive on the 13th of next month. The fourth and fifth batches have also been assigned to two ships in the United States, one loaded with 6,000 tons and one loaded with 5,800 tons. They will all set off this Saturday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 10th of next month. In summary, the five batches before and after total 36,740 tons, totaling 400,000 bags. The rest of the four ships all go to the Chinese warehouses.</p>
<h3>Shipping Goods to the United States</h3>
<p>This time, the China Merchants Bureau directly booked the charter boats for wheat transportation from foreign shipping companies at a very low price, less than two US dollars per ton. After the first wheel, the Array Fubengk, unloads its cargo in Shanghai, it will load export goods in Shanghai and go to the United States. Its ship feet have been collected and distributed by the China Merchants Bureau and are waiting to be loaded and shipped. The China Merchants Bureau is also engaged in foreign shipping, which is the first time, and it must be recorded.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Announcement to Be Decided This Month</h3>
<p>As for the date of the official Sino-British telegraph announcement, according to the station, although the installed transmitter and receiver have been completed, the wiring and correction procedures are quite cumbersome. Recently, the engineer is gradually connecting the required electricity to the new machines, and testing whether there are any errors in the installed machines, and correcting the musical notes to see if they are clear. Therefore, the date of the Sino-British announcement must be determined after the new machines have been corrected. It is expected that it will be officially announced by the end of this month or early next year.</p>
<h3>Imposing: Import Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance decided to implement the collection of import tariffs on foreign rice, wheat and wheat flour on the 16th. It has been decided to collect them from the 16th of this month. The Customs Tax Department and the Customs Supervision Office have been instructed to follow the tax rate standard, which will be officially announced tomorrow (14th). As for the report of collecting anti-dumping tax, it is a rumor. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Customs Ordered to Implement</h3>
<p>After receiving the Ministry of Finance's instructions on collecting import tariffs on foreign rice, wheat, and wheat flour on the 10th of this month, the General Customs Tax Department and the Customs Supervision Office respectively transferred the instructions to the local Jianghai Customs for reference. The tax rate method standard could have been announced earlier, but in order to prevent tax evasion and other malpractices, it was temporarily kept secret. Therefore, the outside world believes that the date of collection is set for New Year's Day next year. A reporter from the Dagon Society has inquired from reliable sources for several days and has confirmed that the import tariffs on foreign rice, wheat, etc. will be collected from the 16th of this month. The detailed tax rate method will be officially announced tomorrow (14th).</p>
<h3>Tax Rate Standard Content</h3>
<p>Foreign rice and foreign wheat have not been taxed in the past, but foreign wheat flour originally had a tax of 0.25 yuan per 100 pounds (that is, 2 jiao 5 fen in gold units). Therefore, the types of import tariffs collected by the Ministry of Finance this time are divided into two types: A, foreign rice is set as an increase in tax, and B, foreign wheat flour is set as an additional tax. The tax rate standard is as follows: (1) Foreign rice (old system 100 pounds equals 605 customs weights) is taxed at one yuan (calculated in gold units). (2) Foreign wheat (old system 100 pounds equals 605 customs weights) is taxed at 0.30 (that is, 3 jiao in gold units). (3) Foreign wheat flour (old system 100 pounds equals 605 customs weights) is taxed at 0.75 (that is, 7 jiao 5 fen in gold units).</p>
<h3>Loss of Flour Merchants</h3>
<p>The flour manufacturers in this city, such as Fufeng, Shenda, Fuxin, Shengda, and Xinda, in addition to ordering the first batch of American wheat of eight ships from the American Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office of the Central Bank, also continued to purchase foreign wheat of eleven ships directly from Chicago, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and other places. Since they learned that the tax collection period was set to be implemented on January 1 next year, the goods were all agreed to be shipped to Shanghai for delivery by the end of this year. However, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the collection of taxes on foreign rice, wheat, and wheat flour in advance, the losses were not small. According to the results of inquiries from various banks by the Dagon Society reporter, in addition to the government's own tax guarantee for the eight ships of American wheat, the direct order of the eleven ships of foreign wheat by the manufacturers will result in an import tariff loss of more than 770,000 yuan, with each ship being over 7,500 tons.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Travels</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Liu Weichi, Yang Dezhao, and Li Shijia took the night express train to Beijing yesterday. Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, took the night express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Railways Detail: Method for Civil Aviation to Participate in Joint Transport: = Divided into Six Articles to Reply to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan = = China Merchants Bureau Has Signed a Contract and Will Continue to Implement it as Scheduled =</h3>
<p>The situation of solving the struggle of private shipping companies to participate in land-water joint transportation has been seen in previous reports. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency stationed in Beijing has obtained the original text of the official letter from the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, which has detailed regulations on the solution. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Repeated Requests from Private Shipping Companies to Participate</h3>
<p>It is hereby noted that on October 5th of this year, your office's letter number 2937 stated: "By order of the President of the Executive Yuan, regarding a telegram from the Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokers Association stating that the Shanghai line of the joint water-land responsible transportation agreement between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has created a monopoly, crushing private shipping, and requesting equal treatment, etc., the Yuan has ordered the Ministries of Transportation and Railways to jointly discuss and reply. Apart from separate letters, a copy of the original telegram is enclosed for your consideration." This matter is currently under review. Furthermore, your office's letter number 3371 of November 3rd of this year stated: "By order of the President of the Executive Yuan, regarding a telegram from the Shanghai Shipping Association elaborating on the difficulties faced by the shipping industry and earnestly requesting that private shipping companies be allowed to participate in the joint water-land transportation business on an equal footing with state-run shipping companies, in order to provide relief, etc., the Yuan has ordered the Ministries of Transportation and Railways to jointly and appropriately investigate and report. Apart from separate letters, a copy of the original documents is enclosed for your consideration." This matter is also under review. Regarding the request from private shipping companies to join the joint water-land transportation scheme, the Ministry of Railways had previously responded to your office's letter number 2693, stating that "Because the joint water-land transportation is a new undertaking with many complex aspects, it is planned to extend it to private shipping companies after the railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have achieved success." A letter requesting consideration was sent. Subsequently, a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, stated that "Yu Hede and others have telegraphed requesting immediate approval for private shipping companies to participate in the joint water-land transportation scheme," requesting a swift investigation. Furthermore, the Shanghai Forwarding Association, Shipping Association, and San Bei Steam Navigation Company have successively submitted separate telegrams. After detailed deliberation, it was found that the request from private shipping companies to undertake joint water-land transportation is supported in both policy and principle.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Requires Thorough Planning</h3>
<p>However, joint water-land transportation covers a wide range and a large scale. Once joint transportation is implemented, external procedures, such as receiving and transporting goods from merchants, must be carefully protected along the way. Various preparations are necessary, which cannot be done hastily. Internal procedures, such as the railway and shipping companies allocating funds to each other, paying customs duties, transferring goods, and training employees, also require thorough planning and solid credibility to ensure smooth operation. Therefore, a joint water-land transportation contract was first signed with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for a one-year trial. Moreover, the railway and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been discussing joint water-land transportation since the third and fourth years of the Republic of China. After years of planning, at the fifteenth National Joint Transportation Conference in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent representatives to attend and agreed on the general principles of joint transportation. By the time responsible railway freight transportation was implemented last year, the necessity of implementing responsible joint water-land freight transportation was even more keenly felt. At the sixteenth National Joint Transportation Conference this year, it was decided that joint water-land transportation was a pioneering undertaking with complex procedures, so the previous discussions were continued, and the opinions of various routes were integrated to agree on twenty-one articles of joint water-land transportation measures. Representatives of the joint transportation office, representing the state-owned railways, signed a joint transportation contract with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be followed. The articles of the contract either refer to the established regulations of joint water-land transportation in the East and West or are based on the established customs of various routes and shipping lines in the country, decided according to actual needs. Private shipping companies participating in joint water-land transportation must also first have a complete organization before they can be allowed. It is difficult to allow them to join without restrictions.</p>
<h3>Six Measures for Private Participation</h3>
<p>To uphold the established measures and the principle of equal treatment for state-run and private shipping companies, the two ministries jointly discussed and decided on six measures for private shipping companies to participate in joint water-land transportation: (1) Chinese private and state-run shipping companies may participate in joint water-land transportation, but only those that have been operating regularly on various routes since November of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China and own their own wharves and warehouses are eligible. (2) Private shipping companies intending to participate in joint water-land transportation must first submit a request to the Ministries of Transportation and Railways for approval. (3) Participating shipping companies shall establish a joint water-land transportation office, and its expenses shall be shared proportionally according to the tonnage of joint transportation cargo loaded by each company. (4) The allocation of joint transportation cargo shall be based on the proportion of ships currently operating regularly by each company, but this shall not apply if customers are unwilling to consign goods due to inadequate equipment. (5) Participating shipping companies must comply with the contract and operating rules separately established by the Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways and various railway bureaus with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (6) Before the establishment of the joint office of private and state-run shipping companies, the contract and operating rules separately established by the Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways and various railway bureaus with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shall be implemented as scheduled. With these measures, the established joint transportation contract can be implemented as scheduled, and private shipping companies can apply for participation at any time. In addition to telegraphing a response to Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Railways will separately issue instructions to the Shanghai Forwarding Association, Shipping Association, and San Bei Steam Navigation Company. A corresponding letter is hereby sent for your review and transmission to the Executive Yuan Secretariat, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, and Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing Sub-Customs Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>To be converted into a wharf for passenger and cargo handling. The Jianghai Customs has received an order from the government to cease operation of the Jiaxing Sub-Customs, which belongs to the Hangzhou Customs, from January 1, 23rd year of the Republic, and to convert the site into a wharf for passenger and cargo handling. Taxation methods will remain unchanged. The original notification reads: "We have now received an order from the government instructing the Hangzhou Customs' Jiaxing Sub-Customs to cease operation on a trial basis on December 31st of this year. From January 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, the site will be converted into a wharf for passenger and cargo handling.

<h3>San Bei Company's Wan Xiang Vessel Causes Major Disaster Upstream of Wuxue. =A small troop transport vessel sunk in the dark of night= =More than sixty people drowned, beyond rescue=</h3>
<p>-Over sixty people also rescued on the scene- The San Bei Company's Wan Xiang vessel, returning to Shanghai from Fuzhou, altered its route to the Yangtze River. While travelling through Yizhou, upstream of Wuxue, due to foggy conditions, the vessel struck and sank a small troop transport, resulting in the drowning of over sixty individuals. The details of this incident are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Wan Xiang Alters Its Course to the Yangtze</h3>
<p>The Wan Xiang vessel of the San Bei Company originally travelled between Shanghai and Fuzhou. Following the Fujian Incident, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's telegrammed instructions, the Shanghai-Fujian route was suspended and the vessel was redirected to the Yangtze River. However, the ship owners were not very familiar with the waterways of the Yangtze River, as the vessel was a sea-faring one. Therefore, the company reassigned Weng Jiqing, the ship owner of the Qingpu vessel, to the Wan Xiang, as he was more familiar with the Yangtze River route. Little did they know that a tragic accident of unprecedented proportions would occur upstream of Wuxue.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Strikes Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Wan Xiang was carrying a large number of passengers and cargo on its upstream journey. It stopped to unload goods at Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and other locations along the way. On the 10th, after unloading passengers and cargo at Xunpu, it set sail for Hankou. At 4:20 AM yesterday (the 12th), the vessel was above Wuxue, below Yizhou. At that time, the weather was still dark, and the river was foggy. As the Wan Xiang was sailing upstream, it unexpectedly collided with a small vessel coming from the opposite direction in the dark and foggy conditions. The small vessel was broken apart and immediately sank into the river, with all those on board falling into the water.</p>
<h3>Over Sixty Lives Lost to Drowning</h3>
<p>Immediately after the accident, the Wan Xiang stopped, and all the crew members began rescue operations. Lifeboats were launched to search and rescue. After two or three hours, over sixty people were rescued and brought aboard the Wan Xiang. Due to the darkness, it was unknown which vessel had sunk. Later, after questioning the rescued individuals, the ship owner learned that the sunken vessel was a small military transport steaming from Hankou, carrying over one hundred armed comrades and service personnel bound for Jiujiang. Unexpectedly, the Wan Xiang struck it amidships, and the vessel sank within two or three minutes, resulting in the drowning of at least sixty people due to the lack of time for rescue.</p>
<h3>Vessel Proceeds to Hankou After the Incident</h3>
<p>After the tragic event, the Wan Xiang telegraphed both Shanghai and Hankou to report the accident. They also transported the rescued sixty or so people to Hankou, after providing them with clothes to change into. The Wan Xiang arrived in Hankou yesterday afternoon. The San Bei Company in Hankou has dispatched a vessel to the area around the site of the accident upstream of Yizhou to search for bodies in order to prepare coffins for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office to Wire Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the San Bei Company received a telegram from the captain of the Wan Xiang in Hankou, which stated: "The Wan Xiang vessel, at 4:20 this morning (the 12th), sank a small military transport downstream of Yizhou. The small vessel immediately sank, carrying over one hundred soldiers, etc. Sixty or so people were rescued on the scene. At 6:00 AM, we set sail for Hankou." Upon receiving this report, the Shanghai office telegraphed Hankou to investigate the truth of the incident and ordered the Hankou branch to send a vessel to salvage bodies and discuss post-incident measures.</p>
<h3>Post-Incident Measures to be Taken</h3>
<p>The Wan Xiang vessel sank a military transport, and many of those who died were service personnel, with the total number of drowned reaching as high as sixty or seventy people. The small vessel has been completely destroyed and submerged at the bottom of the river. It is unknown whether there will be any compensation for the victims. The matter will be determined after negotiations with the other party. As for Weng Jiqing, while serving as captain of the Qingpu vessel last month, he ran that vessel aground in Digang. The vessel has not yet been salvaged, and the company has already suffered losses exceeding ten thousand yuan. Now, he has sunk a small vessel, drowning dozens of people, which is an even greater tragedy. Therefore, the company authorities are quite dissatisfied with him. More details will be provided in subsequent reports.</p>
<h3>British Envoy Commutes Prisoner's Sentence Before Farewell: Mrs. Hartley Spared from Death</h3>
<p>Confined in Xiamen Road Prison. According to the "North China Daily News," the British Consulate-General in Shanghai received an unofficial notification that Mrs. Hartley, the defendant convicted of murdering her lover, Yang Ge, sentenced to death, and whose appeal had been rejected, had her death sentence commuted by Sir Miles Lampson, the British Envoy to China, on the eve of his departure for England. The official documents are expected to be delivered to the British Consulate-General this afternoon, before Sir Miles boards his ship. According to British authorities this morning (12th), the "North China Daily News" was informed that Mrs. Hartley's death sentence has now been reduced to life imprisonment with hard labor, and she will be confined in the Xiamen Road Prison in this city.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Long Mao Warehouse: Wool and Silk Losses in the Millions=Fireman Xiao Long Severely Injured=</h3>
<p>The Long Cang foreign firm engages in the import and export of goods, with wool and silk being their primary items. Their warehouse is located at No. 7 Guangdong Road, comprising two buildings, one facing Edward Road and Sichuan Road, and the other facing Guangdong Road. The import and export operations of the warehouse are also located on Guangdong Road. Last year, the rear building of the warehouse was accidentally set on fire, causing extensive damage and the loss of all goods stored inside, resulting in significant losses. Unexpectedly, at approximately 10:30 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the front building. Local patrol officers noticed the fire and notified the police station, who in turn notified the fire brigade. Fire engines were dispatched to the scene, but the fire had already become uncontrollable. Simultaneously, the fire intensified, engulfing the second to fifth floors. Firemen attempted to enter the building, opening windows to allow water to be poured in. At the same time, ladders were raised to spray water from above. Tragically, a fireman named Xiao Long, badge number 301, fell from the ladder while bravely climbing it, resulting in severe injuries. He was immediately transported to the police hospital by ambulance for treatment, and his life is in critical condition. Other firemen continued to work tirelessly, but the fire was too large and flared up repeatedly. The firefighting efforts continued for a long time without much success. Around 12:00 AM, the fire finally began to weaken, preventing it from spreading further. However, the white smoke was pervasive, like a dense fog. It is feared that the fire will not be completely extinguished until this morning. As for the losses, it is said that the main items are wool and silk, amounting to millions.</p>
<h3>Woman Uses Pig's Blood on Child's Head in Clever Money-Making Scheme</h3>
<p>-Pretends to Give Birth by the Roadside- Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, behind the Yangjing Temple at the Dongyi ferry in Pudong, a middle-aged woman was sitting on the ground, with an infant wrapped in an outer garment. The infant had fresh red blood on its head, visible from the outside. The woman claimed that due to poverty, she had come out to borrow money, and while passing by this place, she had suddenly gone into labor. A large crowd gathered, and many people, thinking the woman was pitiful, offered small amounts of money to help her. At that moment, Police Sergeant Wu Ruixiang and a patrolman from the Third District passed by. Feeling sorry for the woman, Sergeant Wu ordered her to get up and gradually walk to the nearby Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, the woman initially complied, but when they reached the hospital entrance, she suddenly stopped and refused to enter. Sergeant Wu became suspicious and forcibly brought her into the hospital. After examination by the obstetrician, it was found that the woman was not in labor, and the infant was three or four months old. Thus, the scam was completely exposed. The police sergeant took her to the Third District, where the district chief interrogated her. The woman confessed that her surname was Zhu, she was 31 years old, from Taizhou, and because of poverty, she had no regular meals. She wanted to beg but was ashamed, so she had no choice but to bring out her sister's three-month-old child, put pig's blood on its head, and pretend to give birth in the hopes that others would pity her and give her money. She lived in a shack near the South Pier in Pudong. The district chief was touched by this confession. Although the woman's scheme to cheat money was illegal, it was understandable under the circumstances. Therefore, after severely reprimanding her and ordering her not to repeat the trick, he released her leniently.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault in Western Shanghai: Zhang Jinfu and His Sister-in-Law Both Injured: Detectives Apprehend Three Robbers in Pursuit</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinfu, a farmer, lives in Qiaodeng Road, Anhe Road, Western Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, while Jinfu and his sister-in-law, Zhang Cao, were working in the fields, two men in short jackets riding bicycles approached them. Jinfu thought they were simply passersby and paid no attention. However, after reaching Zhang's house, the two men stopped, dismounted, and, leaving their bicycles by the bamboo fence, walked towards the fields. Approaching Zhang Cao, they attempted to snatch a gold ring from her hand without explanation. Zhang Cao cried out for help. In desperation, the two robbers each fired a shot at Zhang Cao, hitting her in the thigh. She fell into the field. Jinfu saw this and rushed to pursue them, reaching Fuxu Road. Jinfu happened to see a bicycle belonging to a friend parked outside. Seeing the robbers fleeing, fearing they would escape, he jumped on his friend's bicycle and gave chase. Seeing this, the robbers fired three shots at him, one hitting Zhang in the chest and exiting through his back. He also fell off the bicycle. The robbers then managed to escape. However, patrol officers from both the Public Concession and the French Concession had heard the alarm and gathered at the scene. Seeing the situation, they gave chase in all directions. Before long, they apprehended one robber in Lane 1981 on Fuxu Road and confiscated a pistol with twelve bullets. He was immediately taken to the police station. He confessed that his name was Xu Deyou and that he worked as a cook at the Tongwen Academy. At the same time, the police compared the confiscated bullets with the recovered casings. They did not match. Xu was taken to the Tongwen Academy for questioning. The academy firmly denied any involvement. The French police considered this untrue and highly suspicious. They took Xu Deyou back to the police station for further interrogation. He then confessed that he had indeed conspired to commit the robbery, but he had not fired the shots. The robbers who fired the shots were hiding somewhere on Annam Road. Upon receiving this information, the police dispatched detectives to secretly arrest them, and they apprehended two more robbers and confiscated two more pistols. They were all taken into custody at the police station, awaiting transfer to the court. Zhang Jinfu and Zhang Cao were both taken to the hospital for treatment by police vehicles. However, Zhang Jinfu's injuries were more severe, and his life is in danger.</p>

The original letter stated: "We respectfully write to inform you that in recent years, imports have exceeded exports, and economic rights have been lost. Taking cosmetics as an example, the annual outflow reaches 1.4 million yuan. The magnitude of the leak is truly alarming. Furthermore, frequent natural disasters and foreign troubles are increasing daily. All industries are collapsing, and the people's livelihood is deteriorating. If we do not strive for prosperity and strength, how will we survive? Therefore, saving the country with national products is a matter of urgency. Shanghai is a Chinese and foreign commercial port with a large population and thriving trade, leading the country in prosperity. Therefore, any action taken here serves as a model for the entire nation. The impact is far-reaching. Recognizing this, our association has specifically organized the Shanghai Special District National Products Sports and Exhibition in order to awaken national awareness. Since the beginning of preparations, we have spared no effort. All national products have been collected as much as possible so that the nation can have the opportunity to recognize and purchase national products, integrating production and consumption. Mutual understanding will be achieved, resolving past divisions. Preparations have now been completed. The opening ceremony will be held at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month at the Guanghua Grand Theater. We respectfully request that you honor us with your presence to observe the ceremony and preside over the unveiling ceremony, to grace the occasion."</p>
<h3>National Products Promotion Association: Supports the Changzhou China National Products Commercial Center</h3>
<p>Scheduled to open on New Year's Day next year. The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association previously received a letter from Changzhou gentry and merchants He Xiaohu, Wang Haibei, He Yunzhong, Xu Xun, He Xun'an, etc., stating that they were raising funds to establish the Changzhou China National Products Commercial Center and had designated the new three-story building inside Zhongshan Gate as the site. They requested assistance in proceeding. It was considered that Changzhou is the central hub of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the traffic center for Jiangyin, Danyang, Jintan, Yixing, Liyang, Wuxi, and other counties and cities, and the establishment of an inland commercial center is an excellent opportunity to promote national products, in line with the organization's members for promoting trade and national products to the countryside. In addition to sending a reply letter, standing committee member Chen Binghui and Secretary-General Xu Qiaoqi were dispatched to inspect the site to facilitate planning. It has been learned that Chen and Xu have returned to Shanghai. According to them, Mr. He is a powerful local gentry and merchant who is enthusiastic about promoting national products. He deeply laments that inland people are surrounded by foreign goods, shifting their preference away from national products, leading to rural bankruptcy and impoverishment of the people. He is determined to provide relief and regain economic rights. He is deeply admired for his patriotism, awakening others with his foresight. The commercial center is well-organized, with magnificent architecture, located in a densely populated and commercially prosperous area. Its future development is promising. This association serves factories, seeks outlets for national products, and has an undeniable responsibility to assist. Within the realm of possibility, we will solicit the participation of leaders from various factories, striving to meet the opening date of New Year's Day next year, thereby fulfilling Mr. He and others' grand vision of promoting national products and fulfilling this association's longstanding desire to protect factory members.</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation of Silk Factories' Decline</h3>
<p>Both labor and management are in difficult situations. According to the New Sound News Agency, due to the impact of Japanese silk dumping in European and American markets, the silk market has declined. Although the government has issued public bonds for relief, it has been ineffective. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have almost completely closed down. Factory owners are unable to maintain operations, and instances of absconding and bankruptcy declarations are common. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Manager Flees</h3>
<p>Of the 113 single and double-loom silk factories in this city, only 18 are barely managing to maintain operations. Each factory has suffered significant losses. The Fuxing Silk Factory on Changan Road in Zhabei, with 216 looms and approximately 300 male and female workers, has a manager who absconded due to excessive losses and owing workers over 4,000 yuan in wages. After the factory declared a shutdown on the 24th of last month, the workers still did not receive their wages. All the male and female workers were panicked and gathered at the factory owner's residence to protest. After the Fourth District Public Security Bureau sent police to persuade them, they temporarily dispersed. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, all the workers once again flocked to the Sixth District Silk Industry Workers' Union in Nanlinli, demanding negotiations. Persuasion was ineffective. Fortunately, Dai Youheng from the Municipal Party Committee, Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau, the patrol officer from the Tianbaoli Sub-Bureau of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, and union directors explained the situation to the workers, and they dispersed. It is reported that the party and government agencies have begun mediation.</p>
<h3>Demolition of Factory Buildings</h3>
<p>Wu Zhu Silk Factory on Xinfeng Road, Zhabei, divided into four workshops and subleased to Fuchangtai and three other silk factories, is now experiencing a decline in the silk industry. All workshops are vacant, and a portion of the factory buildings were destroyed by Japanese bombs during the January 28th Incident. The small factory owner, Mr. Wu, decided to demolish the four workshops and convert them into residential housing. He laid off twenty-two workers who managed the machinery in the four workshops. However, disputes arose over severance pay. The Sixth District Silk Industry Workers' Union negotiated with the factory owner without success and was forced to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter according to the law. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management for questioning on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but due to the intense dispute over severance pay, no resolution was reached. It is reported that the bureau decided to formally convene a mediation session.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong, Shanghai-Beiping, and Shanghai-Chengdu Routes Took Off from Longhua Airport Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Two newly purchased aircraft will be shipped to Shanghai by the end of January next year, according to the Central News Agency. China National Aviation Corporation released the following information: (1) The "Sixteenth" aircraft on the Shanghai-Guangdong route crashed near Zhoushan a month ago. All nine passengers and pilots were rescued and sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. At that time, in addition to two minor injuries, seven were hospitalized. A passenger surnamed Zhang recovered and was discharged a few days ago, and yesterday a passenger surnamed Yang also recovered after treatment and returned to Wenzhou by boat. There are still five people in the hospital, and it is still unknown whether the co-pilot's legs can be saved from becoming disabled. (2) Yesterday morning, the company's Shanghai-Guangdong, Shanghai-Beiping, and Shanghai-Chengdu routes were all on duty. Because the weather was clear in the early morning, they took off from Longhua Airport successively at 6:00 and 8:00. (3) The company purchased two new aircraft, the same model as the "Sevence" aircraft currently used on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, which will be shipped to Shanghai by the end of January next year. One of them will be used on the Shanghai-Guangdong route. (4) The company has scheduled a board meeting for 10:00 am on the 14th of this month (Thursday), the last meeting of the year. At that time, a comprehensive report on the company's business will be given, and the business strategy for next year will be discussed and decided.</p>
<h3>Northeast Anti-Japanese Army General Returns to Engage in Industry =Accepts Anti-Japanese Comrades to Sustain Livelihoods= =Established Juxun Chemical Industrial Society=</h3>
<p>Zhang Minli, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, invested in industry in Chengdu, Sichuan, after the failure of the anti-Japanese war. Now he has come to Shanghai to organize the Juxun Chemical Industrial Society, with Mr. Zhang serving as president. He accepts anti-Japanese comrades and promotes products, using the surplus to maintain their livelihoods. It was formally established yesterday and began operations. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, he hosted a reception for local newspaper reporters on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, reporting on the organizational process and gifting the society's products, including tooth powder and snow jade cream. He also invited the reporters to visit the society's dormitory. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Hosting Reporters</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, Mr. Zhang specially hosted local newspaper reporters and people from all walks of life on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, reporting on his experience of participating in the failed anti-Japanese war and the process of organizing the Juxun Chemical Industrial Society. More than 30 newspaper reporters and guests from all walks of life attended, and each person was given a copy of the "Heartache" brand tooth powder, snow jade cream, and anti-frost honey created by Mr. Zhang.</p>
<h3>Participating in the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>After an introduction by Yang Xinru, Mr. Zhang began his report, stating, "After graduating from the Japanese Military Academy and returning to China, I served in the military in Sichuan, as my home was in Sichuan. After the September 18th Incident, I was filled with hatred for the rampant violence of the Japanese invaders. I gathered comrades to organize a volunteer army and went north to resist Japan, engaging in the work of saving the country. Before Shenyang was lost, I discussed with Xiaobailong and worked together to attack the Huhuai Road area. With a battalion of troops, we killed thousands of Japanese invaders and seized countless machine guns and other weapons. Although our army also suffered sacrifices, our determination to resist Japan grew stronger."</p>
<h3>Returning After Failure</h3>
<p>"In the end, due to insufficient ammunition and lack of reinforcements, the two provinces of Northeast China fell one after another. I had no choice but to lead a portion of my comrades to retreat into the customs and seek other ways to wait for another opportunity. However, the retreating soldiers had no work to do, lacked food and clothing, and found it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, I personally engaged in industry in Chengdu, Sichuan, manufacturing domestic cosmetics and accepting anti-Japanese comrades who had returned from the battlefield and had nothing to do as a place to settle down. To date, thousands of comrades have temporarily sustained their lives through this."</p>
<h3>Establishing an Industrial Society</h3>
<p>"Recently, I came to Shanghai, and many anti-Japanese comrades who had returned from the Northeast requested assistance. In order to help them support themselves and save the country, I initiated the organization of the Juxun Chemical Industrial Society, inviting them to become members. Preparations have been completed and work has begun today. All raw materials for the products come from Sichuan and are all local products. They are decorated in Shanghai, and each member is responsible for taking the prescribed items outside to promote sales every day. The surplus is enough to maintain their livelihoods. My organization of this society neither solicits donations from outside nor raises shares. I will provide guidance from time to time so that many anti-Japanese comrades can maintain their lives." Subsequently, Zhou Tiebi, commander of the Ninth Route Army and Fourth Detachment of the Northeast Volunteer Army, Huang Xuhong, chief of staff of the Iron Blood Volunteer Army, and Liu Kehen, commander of the Twenty-sixth Route Army Detachment, successively reported on the details of their anti-Japanese experiences. The speech length is omitted.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Dormitory</h3>
<p>The society's factory is located in the Lafayede Road Lafayede Lane in the French Concession, and a dormitory for members has been established on Lafayede Road Albert Road. Mr. Zhang hired several cars to invite reporters to visit the members' dormitory after tea and refreshments. The society's dormitory is a three-story building with a monthly rent of sixty yuan. More than twenty members live in the first, second, and third dormitories. Anti-Japanese slogans are still pasted all over the walls, but they all look haggard and quite miserable. It was not until after four o'clock that the visit ended, and the reporters were sent back. The hospitality was quite thoughtful. The society's products, under the "Heartache" trademark, first produce (1) tooth powder, (2) snow jade cream, (3) frostbite ointment, (4) talcum powder, and (5) anti-freeze honey, all of which are of good quality and low price.</p>
<h3>Dependents of Wang Delin's Troops: Six Were Sent Back to Their Hometowns Yesterday</h3>
<p>Those remaining in Shanghai are still being taken care of by the Northeast Refugee Association. The families of General Wang Delin's Northeast Volunteer Army have been seeking refuge in Shanghai for eight months. Daily expenses are covered by various charitable organizations, which have tasked the Northeast Refugee Joint Association with providing care. Yesterday, six people, including Liu Qinghua and Mrs. Liang Wang, requested assistance to return to their original homes in Northeast China. Representatives Zhang Chuyu and Liang Yuanshan sent a letter to the Relief Association requesting assistance. The association approved the request and provided six boat tickets and 25 yuan in travel expenses to each person. They were escorted to the Zhaonan North Station the day before yesterday to board the Puan wheel to Qingdao, and then transferred by car back to their hometowns. According to the person in charge of the association, of the three houses rented by the association at numbers 16, 18, and 25 Cai Shou Lane, Julaida Road, only the house at number 16 has been returned to the Postal Savings Bureau. Numbers 18 and 25 will continue to be rented. The report in yesterday's (the day before yesterday's) newspaper that the association had completely returned the rentals was not true. Only six people returned this time, and more than one hundred people remain here. If all the rentals were returned, the refugees would have nowhere to settle. All expenses required by the dependents will continue to be covered by the association as before.</p>

<h3>Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and National Government in Nanjing</h3>
<p>To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and National Government,</p>
<p>Chen Li and other rebels colluded with the Communist Party to form a government, change the era name, destroy our national foundation, and harm the people of Fujian. Elders throughout the country are indignant, and overseas compatriots gnash their teeth upon hearing the news. What crime have the people committed to encounter such misfortune? What fault have the people of Fujian committed to encounter such poison? They use the people of Fujian as puppets for rebellion and the land of Fujian as a testing ground for communism. How can such a major change that endangers the country and the people be allowed to persist? We overseas Fujianese, filled with hatred, can only unite and strengthen our forces to serve as the central government's rearguard. We implore you to issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion and quickly quell the chaos to save the people of Fujian from their dire straits. We are urgently awaiting orders.</p>
<p>The Overseas Fujianese Save-the-Homeland Association kowtows in sincerity.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Chairman Chiang in Nanchang</h3>
<p>To Chairman Chiang,</p>
<p>The disasters that have befallen Fujian Province in recent years have compounded, and the suffering of the people of Fujian is indescribable. In addition, last year's red atmosphere engulfed Yunyan, Lve Tingzhang, creating a tragic situation of widespread sorrow and displacement. Our overseas Fujianese elders and brothers have been running around and crying out, trying to remedy the situation, and welcomed the 19th Route Army to Fujian with sincerity, hoping to resolve the stalemate in Fujian Province. The eagerness for governance was like longing for clouds in a great drought. Unexpectedly, in the past year, taxes have become more onerous, banditry has become more rampant, and the suffering of the people of Fujian has deepened, and their dire straits have not been resolved. Recently, the army has colluded with Chen Mingshu and Yao Jishen to form a false government, forcibly violating the will of the people and betraying the party and the country, harming our eight Fujian provinces. They use the lives and property of the people of Fujian as resources for their rebellion, and occupy the territory of Fujian Province as a base for usurpation. What crime have the people of Fujian committed to suffer such meaningless sacrifices, and the nation's vitality has been weakened by another point, and there is another opportunity for foreign insults to attack. It is heartbreaking. We deeply hope that the central government will issue an order to suppress the rebellion, and we implore you to send troops to quell the chaos as soon as possible to save the people of Fujian from the depths of water and fire. We overseas Fujianese pledge to be the central government's rearguard, and we are eagerly awaiting orders.</p>
<p>The Overseas Fujianese Save-the-Homeland Association kowtows in sincerity.</p>
<h3>News from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road has been receiving special representatives from various disaster areas who have personally come to the association to beg for relief. The situation is overwhelming. The disaster situation described by the representative from Gansu a few days ago was extremely serious, which has already been briefly recorded in previous reports. Now, representatives from Henan and Hebei, both Chinese and foreign, have also personally described the disaster situation in the two provinces. Details are recorded separately below. (Henan) Father Xuan Weili, a western missionary from the Street Radiant Catholic Church, came to the association specifically from the disaster area of Huaxian County. He said that when the Yellow River flooded, he personally drove a boat to rescue the disaster victims who were submerged. It is now winter, and there is still accumulated water that has not receded. Where the water has receded, the mud is very deep. If they want to restore cultivation, they do not know when they will be able to do so. Now, sorrowful cries are heard everywhere, and many are selling their children and daughters in order to survive. It is reported that in addition to the large amount of relief clothing and quilts that have already been transported to Henan Province, donations of cotton clothing and other items have been received and will be handed over to the missionary to take back and distribute first. (Hebei) Mr. Wang Fengduo, representative of the Yellow River flood, and Mr. Tian Jianai, representative of the disaster area in the three counties of Changdong and Pu in southern Hebei, arrived together. They personally described the disaster situation in Hebei, which is even more severe than in Henan and Shandong. Not only has the water not receded, but after the flood, places such as steles that were as high as ten feet were only about one foot above the silt. It is shaped like a desert, and agricultural activities have been abandoned. It is now the height of winter, how will they survive the year? The relief of the remaining people after the disaster is especially urgent. It is reported that in addition to a large number of relief clothing and quilts being transported to various disaster areas through Daokou, the association is also willing to provide assistance. However, the disaster area is too wide, and it is difficult to provide comprehensive relief. Moreover, the resources of the relief organization are limited. It is hoped that all sectors will have compassion and provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Successful Well Drilling in Baifu and Other Three Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>Water Problem Comes to an End</p>
<p>Deli Company, the landlord of Baifuli, Baluli, and Baushouli, located between Pingliang Road, Fenzhou Road, and Yangzhou Road in East Shanghai, has found that the price of tap water is too high, and the rental income is not only unprofitable, but also losing money. Although it is planned to sell or mortgage the houses in the three neighborhoods, no one is interested. Therefore, on the one hand, it refuses to pay water bills, and on the other hand, it drills wells to obtain water. Although the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British company, has removed the water meter and cut off the water source, the artesian well drilled by Deli Company was completed yesterday. It immediately borrowed a motor to extract water for use by the tenants in each neighborhood. It is heard that the well water is still clear and usable, and the tenants are all satisfied. The water problem can be said to have come to an end, and the dispute over the landlord's inevitable rent increase can be avoided.</p>

As for Mr. Yiting's paintings, only two pieces were brought for viewing only.</p>
<h3>New Renhe Case Defendants Appeal</h3>
<p>Chen Baosheng, the comprador of the New Renhe Steamboat in Nanshi, Shanghai, and Shen Xingsheng, the shipowner, colluded with the tea room attendants and sailors to plot the murder of Ma Kobao and four others by throwing their bodies into the river.

<h3>Le Zhenbao Kidnapping Case: Accomplice Lu Yunlun Rescheduled for Further Questioning =Case Files Sent to the Supreme Court= =Difficulty in Conducting the Case Due to Lack of Records=</h3>
<p>Le Zhenbao, the owner of Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road, was kidnapped by bandits on the morning of December 9th last year at 9:30 am on Yuyuan Road Hed Road and held for a huge ransom. Subsequently, You A'gen, the chief detective of the Laozha Police Station, rescued Le and arrested more than ten kidnappers, including Ma Gengsheng. The First Special Court sentenced Ma Gengsheng, Guan A'fu, and Ren Xiaoxiang to death, and the rest were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. However, Guan and others had stated that Lu Yunlun (also known as Lu Jiting and Lu Jinbao), the owner of the Chen Linji Auto Shop on Kunming Road and a native of Taizhou, was also an accomplice. The police station repeatedly tried to arrest him but failed. Therefore, Lu's photo was printed on wanted posters. It was not until 3:00 pm on the 4th of this month that Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, met Lu on Aidooar Road and arrested him. He was sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Feng opened the court for further questioning. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station, explained the previous situation and questioned Lu Yunlun, who denied being a bandit and claimed that Guan and others had framed him because he had refused to lend them money. He asked for justice and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend him. Judge Feng stated that the case files of Ma Gengsheng and others had been sent to the Supreme Court, making it difficult to investigate the case. It was really impossible to proceed, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Tao Ergou Dies Tragically After Falling from a Building</h3>
<p>Tao Ergou, a native of Haimen, was 26 years old and a blacksmith. He was working at the Xinrongji Construction Factory, located at No. 73 Fulili Road in the French Concession, which was contracting the construction of French barracks. He specialized in tying steel bars for cement steel skeleton projects. At around 8:00 am yesterday, Tao was working on the third floor when he wanted to bend a steel bar. Unexpectedly, the steel bar suddenly broke, causing Tao to be knocked down and fall to the ground. He broke his head, his brain matter burst out, and his flesh and blood were blurred. He died instantly. The accountant of the factory reported the incident to the French police station, which sent a detective to investigate. The body was immediately taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy room. The Second Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the location and determined that the deceased had indeed died from injuries sustained in the fall. The body was claimed by the deceased's uncle, Tao Sanlang, who provided a bond for the preparation of a coffin and funeral.</p>
<h3>A Lively Play About a Female Teahouse Worker</h3>
<p>Zhang Acai, a Shaoxing native, age 30, who works as a night-soil collector, found his wife living in house number 30, Xue Alley Bottom, North Zhangjia Alley, within the city. His wife, Zhou, is 23 years old and has a five-year-old son named Xingen. Because Zhang's monthly income is meager, he often feels financially strained at home. He asked a friend to introduce his wife, Zhou, to work as a female teahouse worker at a certain amusement park, earning a monthly wage to supplement the household income. However, after becoming a female hostess, she was influenced by the bad environment, and suddenly changed her normal behavior. She did not return home most nights and was recklessly unrestrained. Although Zhang repeatedly advised her, she ignored him. There was a rascal youth named Lu Zhaoqi, 21 years old, originally from Songjiang, who was fond of seeking pleasure with women. He usually liked to frequent brothels, chasing bees and butterflies, enjoying himself. In the summer of this year, Lu happened to visit the amusement park, met Zhou, and was amazed by her beauty, considering her a heavenly being. He often went to the park to drink tea. However, his intention was not really to drink tea. Therefore, he gave more money than others for the tea, showing off his wealth, and taking the opportunity to seduce her. Zhou also took a liking to Lu because he was young and handsome. Therefore, their hearts were in tune, and they soon had a physical relationship, using hotels as a place for secret meetings. Later, because she was madly in love, and constrained by her husband, unable to do as she pleased, she heartlessly abandoned her husband and young son in August, eloping with Lu without a trace. After Zhang discovered this, he searched everywhere for months, but still had no leads. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. yesterday, he received a tip from a friend stating that Zhou was now living with Lu Zhaoqi at house number 17, Shengan Lane, Shachang Street, living together like a married couple. Zhang was furious upon hearing this and immediately rushed to the location, where he found Jiang Zhou, along with Lu Zhaoqi. He tied them both up and handed them over to Wang Baochang, the guard at the 13th post there, who took them to the third precinct of the first district. The warden, Jin, conducted a preliminary hearing. Zhang Zhou swore that she would never return to the Zhang family. Considering that the matter involved the abduction of a married woman, the warden immediately ordered the preparation of documents to be sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Record of a Quarrel Caused by a Wine Pot: Celebrating a Victory in a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The incident of setting off firecrackers caused more trouble. At the end of last month, Lin Chengxu and Tang Chunhua, workers at the Sanbei Shipyard on Rihui Bridge, South Shanghai, quarreled over a wine pot. Lin gathered ruffians and beat Tang Chunhua, injuring him. The police at the post took both parties to the Rihui Bridge Second District Police Station for investigation. Unexpectedly, workers from the Sanbei Shipyard gathered a crowd and rushed to the police station, attempting to seize the defendant, Lin Chengxu. After the police fought hard to resist, they scattered and fled. Later, Lin was transferred to the District Court for trial. Meanwhile, Inspector Zhang Fude of the police station reported to Li Jing, the district chief of the Second District, who was ordered to strictly apprehend the ringleader who seized Lin Chengxu and bring them to justice for verification. Unexpectedly, at noon the day before yesterday, when the Sanbei Shipyard workers were leaving work, about two hundred workers declared that they had won the lawsuit against Tang Chunhua of the Fuxingxiang Hotel and were celebrating the court's release of Lin Chengxu. The workers held firecrackers and rockets high, and set them off along Longhua Road from the factory gate, passing in front of the police station, and all the way to the south entrance of Dapu Road. They set off the rockets and threw them into the police station, causing a loud series of explosions, totaling more than thirty. When they threw them in, Police Officer Wei Zhiren happened to be standing in the reception hall and could not dodge in time, resulting in him being hit by the firecrackers and suffering unbearable pain. Furthermore, many of the workers used abusive language that was unbearable to hear. Due to the large number of people, it was not convenient to take forceful action to avoid causing trouble. However, during this time of martial law, the shipyard workers first seized the criminal and then threw firecrackers, which seriously hindered local public security. How should this be handled? It is requested to review and indicate. It is heard that after receiving the report, Police Chief Li, in addition to ordering the strict apprehension of the ringleader who seized Lin and bringing them to justice, yesterday submitted a report to the General Bureau for review and compliance.</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng Cloth Factory on Longhua Road Robbed</h3>
<p>The Jin Cheng Cloth Factory, located at number 491 Longhua Road, Nanshi, was robbed at 9:30 the night before last, during the night shift. Five robbers broke in, wearing gray robes or blue cloth shirts and pants. Two robbers stood guard outside the door, while three robbers broke into the inner room, displayed handguns, and forbade anyone from making a sound. They then separated and searched. As a result, they only robbed twenty yuan in cash and a gold ring before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the Second District Headquarters of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Guang Ya Silk Weaving Factory on Jumen Road, Nanshi, Suffers Carelessness</h3>
<p>The Guang Ya Silk Weaving Factory, located at number 116 Jumen Road, Nanshi, is owned by Lu Zhongying from Zhejiang. There are more than twenty workers in the factory. At 3:00 a.m. yesterday, the factory's main electrical panel suddenly caught fire, causing a conflagration. At that time, the workers woke up from their dreams, quickly put on their clothes, and immediately drew water to put out the fire. They also reported to the Fire Department, which dispatched vehicles to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished until 4:30 a.m., but the entire factory building had already been reduced to ashes. Afterwards, the local Public Security Bureau detained the owner's wife, Lu Yu, to inquire about the cause of the fire. It is heard that the factory had previously taken out a substantial fire insurance policy.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Yellow River Disaster in Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Tian Jianai and Wang Fengduo, representatives of the Yellow River disaster in Hebei Province, reported last night at the Gospel Broadcasting Wireless Radio Station, that the Yellow River flood in the three counties of southern Hebei was so severe that they came to Shanghai to request disaster relief funds and to close breaches and repair dikes. Now, introduced by Renji Hall, they were asked to report on the Yellow River flood in Hebei Province and briefly describe the following: It has been found that this year's breaches of the Yellow River were mostly within Hebei Province. On the north bank, from Dacheji to Shitou Village, there were more than thirty breaches, flooding the entire northern bank of the county, passing through the northeastern part of Huaxian County in Henan Province, flowing into Puyang, as well as Fanxian, Puyang, Gushou, and Zhang Counties in Shandong. On the east bank, from Pangzhuang through the entire Dongming County, it flowed into Heze and other counties in Shandong. The breaches in the southeast flowed through Lanfeng, Henan, and into Kaocheng and other counties. From this, it can be seen that the water in various places was mostly from Changyuan County in Hebei Province. However, the severity of the disaster in Changyuan County broke the unprecedented record of flood disasters in the country. According to the current situation in Chang, Pu, and Dong counties, it can be divided into two points. Those that have receded have mostly become silted sandy land, more than ten feet high in some places, and several feet high in others. Those that have not receded are still in the great flood because the breach has not been closed and the major flow has not been cut off, and Puyang is still in the great flood. The former fertile fields have mostly turned into barren wasteland. It is estimated that more than 40,000 hectares of land in the three counties have been damaged, and more than 800,000 houses in villages have been washed away by the rapid currents, or silted up with sand. Even those that occasionally survived were nothing more than a tragic state of disrepair. The villages in the three counties were originally very dense, but now they have completely changed their old appearance and mostly become a desolate world. This is the first extraordinarily severe tragic situation. After this Yellow River disaster, the people of the three counties completely lost their three major elements of clothing, food, and shelter. The strong scattered in all directions, the old became starving corpses, or they sold their wives and children. It is said that a woman was sold for only seven yuan, which is heartbreaking. Some entire families were drowned in the Yellow River at that time. Therefore, there were those who committed suicide out of despair. The former wealthy households, with plenty of food and clothing, have now become destitute, without distinction between rich and poor, and everyone cannot live, cutting off this source of life. This is the second extraordinarily severe tragic situation. As for Puyang, there are still more than 680 villages in the great flood. In a blink of an eye, it is bitterly cold, the river is frozen, and the ground is covered with snow and ice. The people have neither clothing nor food to protect their lives, nor shelter to keep their bodies. How can they survive the coming years? After the disaster, many people dig for rotten grain or grass roots to take care of the present. Eating such foul things may inevitably cause epidemics to occur from time to time. According to statistics, the property losses in the three counties are more than 80 million. This is the third extraordinarily severe tragic situation. To summarize the above points, it is very different from the disaster areas in Shandong and Henan. However, Shandong and Henan are slightly farther from the breaches, so the water flow is slower and mostly silted up into fertile fields, turning misfortune into blessing, which is common. Moreover, the two provinces have a hope of a good harvest, and the collapse of houses is less, so they can avoid wind and rain, which cannot be compared with the disaster victims in the three counties of Hebei Province who have no clothes, no food, and no shelter. It can be imagined whether the disaster there is more severe than in Lu and Yu. It is hoped that the gentlemen of the country will take the purpose of disaster relief and assistance, so as to save the disaster after the catastrophe, and perhaps have the hope of revival.</p>
<h3>Meeting and Re-election of the Sand Flower Industry Guild</h3>

<h3>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the South Goods Industry Guild</h3>
<p>The South Goods Industry Guild held its 23rd joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Tanghai North-South Sundries Joint Market the other day. Chairman Gong Jingyan reported on incoming and outgoing documents before starting the discussion. According to the report submitted by the Evaluation Committee, the joint public price reduction of dried longan by the Zhengjia Wood Bridge Guiyuan Industry has had a great impact on the members of the industry in the vicinity and has also led to a few members of the industry imitating it, which fundamentally destroys the guild's industry regulations. Considering the current economic situation in the market, there is also a feeling of having no other choice. The guild has the responsibility to guide them. How should this be handled? It was resolved that the guild's industry regulations were established to protect the interests of the industry. Members should strictly abide by them. Those who deliberately destroy them will be dealt with in accordance with the guild's regulations. It was found that Zaiyang and Hengsheng had the words "large price reduction." The Evaluation Committee was immediately instructed to send a letter to warn and stop them. If they still ignored it, they would be dealt with in accordance with Article 7 of Chapter 4 of the industry regulations. Members were also notified on the spot that they must abide by the industry regulations and must not imitate them again. (2) Discussion. According to the letter from the South Shanghai District Winter Defense Committee, the guild was requested to nominate one representative to participate in assisting in defense affairs. Who should the guild nominate? It was resolved that Committee Member Xu Bokang was publicly elected as the guild's full representative on the spot, and a letter was sent to the committee for verification. (3) Discussion. According to the report submitted by Member Xida Shun Gong, the other day, a few employees, in the name of the former Employees' Union, came to the shop to force the employees to join the union. According to the employees, the user, that is, the General Assembly of the Industry, is a basic member and there is no reason to join the labor union. Unexpectedly, the people who came were unreasonable, acted violently, and caused disturbances. The evidence is conclusive. For the sake of the safety and order of the business, the industry guild is specially requested to handle it in accordance with the law. According to the situation, how should the guild handle it? It was resolved that, based on the previous situation, a document would be prepared and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for legal prohibition, pending approval. The meeting adjourned after discussing other matters.</p>

<h3>Life Insurance and the Development of National Economy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Sixu</p>
<p>The original purpose of life insurance is to encourage personal thrift, protect the lives of family members, and educate children. In short, life insurance is a way to consolidate personal economy, develop personal economy, and even extend to the happiness of family economic groups. From the personal point of view, investing in life insurance is nothing more than intentionally or randomly accumulating scattered sums of money gradually, until a considerable period of time, or when an agreed event occurs, to receive the predetermined whole number for use for a specific purpose. From the family point of view, most of the members of a family, except for the head of the family, are non-producers, and rely solely on the productivity of the head of the family to maintain the lives, education, and entertainment of the entire family. The life and death of the head of the family is the key to their happiness. No one in the world can guarantee the life and death of the head of the family, and their happiness is uncertainly in the hands of the god of fate, and they are powerless to resist. Only life insurance helps them to overcome the god of fate, break the mystery of uncertain life and death, and establish the triumphal arch of happiness. When the head of the family is insured for a considerable amount of life insurance, they - grandparents, parents, wife, children, etc. - do not have to worry about the future of food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment. They are not only a blood group, but also an economically consolidated economic group. However, a blood group, lacking the chain of economic power, is easy to disperse and decline. With the addition of an economic barrier, there is no danger of collapse, so life insurance is an indispensable element of life from their standpoint.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of life insurance itself is for the family. The family is a collection of individuals, and the country is composed of families. Therefore, no matter how large or small the organization of the family is, it is the foundation of the country. The economy of the individual affects the family. The economy of the family affects the country. Although small family systems are prevalent in Europe and the United States, the lives and education of wives and children still rely on the head of the family, who is both husband and father. The organization of the Chinese state has been based on the family as a unit for thousands of years. Personal struggle and hard work are for the sake of (bringing glory to the family), and the prosperity of the family is for the benefit of (family members). Therefore, managing the family and governing the country are both the greatest responsibilities in life. Even today, although small families are advocated, the lives and education of relatives outside the small family must still be supported and maintained by those in charge of the small family. The unfortunate death of the head of a family means hunger, cold, poverty, and suffering for the entire family, which adds a burden to the national economy and a great obstacle to the development of the national economy.</p>
<p>Who created the orphanages and poor children's homes that we see? Isn't it a group of selfish and self-interested fathers who do not care about the happiness of their children after their death? Who are the Qingjie Halls, Old People's Halls, Relief Associations, and Vagrant Vocational Training Centers established for? Isn't it also the result of not caring about the happiness of their wives, not being willing to save money when they are young, and not providing educational funds for their children? Who raises the funds for these various charitable organizations? Is it not from local tax revenues and the burden of the masses? Local tax revenues are the government's income, which could have been used for active construction projects such as public health, education, transportation, and entertainment, but now it is better to provide passive anti-corrosion expenses.

<h3>An Inquiry into the Sincere Life Insurance Company's Operations</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The Sincere Life Insurance Company is an offshoot of the Sincere Department Store. To understand the Sincere Life Insurance Company's situation, one must first know the history and organization of the Sincere Department Store. The Sincere Department Store is the pioneer of domestic department stores, founded 30 years ago by overseas Chinese Mr. Ma Ying-piao and others who returned from Australia. The initial capital was only 25,000 yuan, and the scale was simple. However, with courage and determination, and an indomitable spirit, they managed and operated it, gradually increasing capital from 25,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, then 3 million yuan, then 7 million yuan, and now it has reached a huge sum of 10 million yuan. As capital grew stronger, the spirit of the staff became more courageous and determined. Furthermore, with the revitalization of industry and the maintenance of people's livelihood and national economy as their mission, they successively established the Sincere Cosmetics Company, the Sincere Fire and Water Insurance Company, and the Sincere Life Insurance Company, together with the department store, forming the four major companies. The total capital amounts to 14.5 million yuan (with the Life Insurance Company accounting for 2 million yuan). There are tens of thousands of shareholders, all substantial Chinese merchants. Therefore, from the beginning of its establishment, the Sincere Life Insurance Company had its shareholders as its basic policyholders.</p>
<p>It has been ten years since the establishment of the Sincere Life Insurance Company. It has more than ten thousand policyholders, and the insured amount is approaching ten million, which is quite commendable. The difficult period for a life insurance company is usually the first decade, mainly because the initial expenses are huge, the claim rate is high, and the premiums received are few, often insufficient to cover expenses. Now that the company has safely passed its first decade and has achieved good results, it is because of its perfect organization, solid foundation, the Sincere Department Store as its backing, and the Sincere Fire and Water Insurance Company and Sincere Cosmetics Company as its left and right wings, uniting in one breath to support each other. Therefore, credit is concentrated, and all sectors enthusiastically join. The company has far-reaching expectations for its business prospects. In the future, it will undoubtedly make considerable contributions to cultivating national economic plans.</p>
<p>For a life insurance company to gain the trust of society, solid capital and legal operation are prerequisites. However, monitoring income and expenditure accounts to ensure accuracy is also extremely important, especially with excellent talent and scientific management.</p>
<h3>Life Insurance Special Issue Edited by the China Life Insurance Advancement Society (Issue 10)</h3>
<p>Most of us rely on daily income to live. If something unexpected happens, our wives and children will lose their support. The only way to seek relief is through life insurance. Life insurance does not guarantee that we will live forever and never die, but it compensates for the economic losses suffered due to death. Mr. Ma Yin-chu of the Sincere Life Insurance Company, as its head office is located in Hong Kong, is registered with the Hong Kong government (and also registered with the Ministry of Industry of the National Government). The Hong Kong government has very strict supervision of accounts, and all income and expenditure figures are accurately calculated, with absolutely no perfunctory situations, which is another advantage.</p>
<p>Life insurance is not comparable to short-term savings. As the company has a long history, strong capital, excellent talent, strict supervision, and is organized by purely Chinese merchants, this publication specially introduces it to allow the Chinese people to recognize the banner of the Sincere Life Insurance Company. Mr. Gu Zhuo-lun is from Zhongshan County, graduated from Guangdong Provincial Higher School of Arts and Sciences, and later studied economics at National Peking University. Before the age of 35, he was engaged in political life. Later, due to the unstable political situation, he entered the business world, serving at the Tianjin branch of the National Bank and the head office of the Sincere Fire and Water Insurance Company. In 1929, he was appointed as the manager of the Shanghai Sincere Life Insurance Company. During his tenure, he was able to use his knowledge and experience to make many plans, so the company's life insurance business became increasingly developed.</p>
<h3>What is Risk?</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhuo-lun</p>
<p>Explaining the definition of risk within the scope of life insurance is slightly different from the general understanding. The risk in life insurance is subject to certain conditions and has legal meanings. The conditions and meanings are explained separately below.</p>
<p>(1) The occurrence of the event is not predictable. Things that are foreseeable can be predicted. Having an incurable disease is a foreseeable risk. Committing suicide with a knife is also a foreseeable risk. The former is insured but not accepted, while the latter is accepted but not compensated. If, however, death occurs accidentally due to disease, capsizing of vehicles, fire and water disasters, or harm from thieves and enemies, it is an irreversible event. This is what is meant by the risk in life insurance.</p>
<p>(2) The occurrence of the event must be legal. What is legal? It means complying with national laws and regulations. National laws and regulations stipulate our responsibilities for our actions. If actions violate the law, the state will punish them. Killing, arson, and other illegal acts, resulting in death due to crime or death in prison, are the result of the insured's illegal behavior. The insurer is naturally not responsible. Furthermore, malicious intentions to obtain insurance money quickly and harm the life of the insured are also illegal risks.</p>
<p>(3) The occurrence of the event is not simultaneous. The fundamental concept of insurance is to transfer economic losses to a large number of people so that they bear the burden equally. If a large number of insured households encounter risks in the same period, such as floods or earthquakes, and the number of deaths fills the fields and cities, fulfilling the contract would not only result in claims exceeding compensation, but also in no compensation being possible. Although this type of event is not expressly stipulated by law, it contradicts the fundamental concept of insurance.</p>
<p>(4) The degree of risk must be estimable. Estimation means measuring the degree of risk using statistical methods. Some use age as the standard for estimation, while others use physical condition. For example, the number of deaths per year per thousand people in the 20-year-old age group, and the number of deaths per year per thousand people in the 30-year-old or 40-year-old age group can be known by referring to mortality statistics tables. This is using age to estimate the degree of risk. Another example is after a medical examination, being classified as "sub-healthy" due to physical weakness, or increasing the premium, or shortening the insurance period, with various methods. If the insured makes false statements in response to the insurance company's inquiries, or underreports their age beyond the insurance age table, or uses fraud to conceal information from the medical examiner, making the examination ineffective, the insurer has no way to estimate the degree of risk, and is not responsible if an accident occurs.</p>
<p>(5) The scope of insurance must be specific. If the scope of insurance is limited to limbs, the insurer's responsibility is limited to limbs. Injury to limbs is covered, but death without injury to limbs is not. If the scope of insurance is limited to accidents, the insurer's responsibility is limited to accidents. Death from illness is not covered. Therefore, the insurance contract must specify the nature and type of risk. The type is chosen by the parties involved. The insurer is not responsible if the risk is not of that type.</p>
<h3>Enlarged Meeting of the Life Insurance Advancement Society</h3>
<p>— Record by Fan</p>
<p>The China Life Insurance Advancement Society, located at 19 Avenue Edward VII in this city, held its first general meeting of company members at the Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company at 5:00 PM on November 23, since its recent expansion of organization. Attendees included Song Hanzhang from China Insurance Company, Xue Weifan and Fei Mengfu from American International Assurance Company, Fang Jinghe from Ning Shao Life Insurance Company, Rong Xianlin from Sihai Insurance Company, Lü Yuequan and Gu Qingyi from Hua An Cooperative Life Insurance Company, Ling Yongshu from Sincere Life Insurance Company, and Zhang Sixu from China Life Insurance Advancement Society, among others. It was a grand event. Mr. Lü Yuequan of Hua An was publicly elected as chairman, and Mr. Zhang Sixu, president of the Advancement Society, served as recorder. First, Mr. Zhang gave a brief report on the work of the China Life Insurance Advancement Society before its expansion, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Monthly publication of various promotional illustrations and texts on life insurance in famous domestic magazines such as *The Eastern Miscellany*, *Science*, *Hua Nian*, *The Woman's Messenger*, and *The Chinese Economic Journal*. (2) Timely publication of general business information and various news from various companies in local newspapers to attract public attention. (3) Monthly publication of a special issue of life insurance in the *Shen Bao* and *Shishi Xinbao*, with simple language and significant results, with publication costs shared by companies that have advertisements. (4) Collection of inscriptions and calligraphy from famous figures in the country in support of the life insurance system for viewing and promotion. (5) Dispatching members to various universities to lecture on the meaning and benefits of life insurance and to introduce aspiring young university students as recruiters for various companies. (6) Contacting the Commercial Press to publish various books on life insurance studies compiled and translated by the society (one has already been published and two are in draft form). The society's proposal was accepted by Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general editor of the press, to include life insurance topics in the newly published secondary school citizenship textbooks to explain the true meaning and benefits of life insurance. (7) The society's life insurance quarterly magazine has been published up to its third issue, with publication costs entirely covered by advertising revenue. (8) In order to promote the theory of life insurance and cultivate specialized talent, the society has started to prepare lecture notes and plans to launch a life insurance correspondence course in the shortest possible time. After the report, the meeting discussed the progress of the society's affairs. Chairman Lü Yuequan proposed various proposals from the Sincere Life Insurance Company, which were put to a vote one by one. The meeting was then adjourned. The reporter observed that the Life Insurance Advancement Society, having been established for less than a year, has already achieved remarkable results. Now, with this expanded organization, various companies can support each other to promote progress. It is foreseen that our country's life insurance industry will move forward unceasingly and be promoted and expanded. This should be taken as the starting point.</p>

<h3>Acting Smart</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>People who are truly foolish are not laughable or hateful, but those who are not smart but pretend to be, thinking they are amazing, while messing everything up, are both laughable and hateful. Because those who feel they are foolish will never be reckless or blindly rush around like a blind man riding a blind horse. They have self-awareness, realizing their abilities are inferior to others, so they are willing to work hard steadily. They are willing to humbly accept the advice of others, and they are willing to do things that others are unwilling to do. In the end, their success exceeds those who claim to be geniuses. We should not only not laugh at or hate such people, but we should also admire them and emulate them.</p>
<p>What about those who act smart? They only understand some superficial knowledge—no, some don't even understand the superficial knowledge, they only pick up some scraps from others—and then claim to be some kind of expert. This, of course, impresses those who don't understand this kind of knowledge, who think they are amazing. At the same time, it is not easy to expose this paper tiger's trick. As for those who understand this kind of knowledge, they find it laughable and pitiful.</p>
<p>What is the result for them? Because no one exposes this paper tiger—the reason being that those who don't understand are kept in the dark, and those who do understand disdain to do so—they even start to doubt themselves, thinking they have really become an expert. So they run rampant for a while, thinking they are invincible, and even start to show off in front of real experts. What happens then? They forget that their tail is not hidden—no, even if they want to hide it, they can't, because a tail is still a tail, and a fox will never become a real human. Under the microscope, their true form inevitably appears. Because they look down on everyone, and others previously found them laughable and pitiful and disdained to expose them, their behavior has now reached the point of being extremely hateful. People feel that if they are not exposed, right and wrong will be turned upside down, so they can't avoid the trouble of exposing them.</p>
<p>However, despite what I've said, the number of people who act smart in China is increasing day by day. The reason is that in such a chaotic year and such a chaotic society, truth is thrown into the trash can, and everything is manipulated by speculators. This kind of behavior is a shortcut to fame and fortune. Although they know that the paper tiger will eventually be exposed, by then they will have already achieved fame and profit, so they don't care.</p>
<p>Therefore, in China, experts in multiple fields, celebrities, and geniuses are everywhere. One person can hold ten or twenty positions or more.</p>
<p>Of course, they also know that working hard steadily is the right thing to do, but they feel that this is somewhat foolish and not something a smart person would do!</p>
<p>However, the era is moving forward, and truth will never be thrown into the trash can forever. The fox's tail may be inescapably revealed tomorrow! This, I firmly believe, and you certainly believe too.</p>
<h3>Brief Remarks</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>A large family is like a large ship, while a small family is like a motorboat. Only in certain environments can their characteristics be displayed.</p>
<p>Scolding people is a virtue, not a lack of virtue. As long as the words are just and the tone is stern, it can even be said to be "good scolding"!</p>
<p>In the period from a young girl to a young woman, there is a great change in style! A sharp-tongued girl often easily transforms into a gentle and amiable priestess figure. Of course, believe it or not is up to you.</p>
<p>Your countrymen absolutely believe in "Heavenly Father." They rely on heaven for food, they call talking "chatting with the heavens," and everything is inseparable from heaven. Therefore, everyone is indifferent to national affairs and human affairs! Because "Heaven has eyes," and heavenly justice is manifest, and retribution is inevitable. So, even if they suffer some losses, they accept it, because heaven will always provide a way out.</p>
<p>People say that laughing three times a day is good for the body and mind. I think crying three times a day might also be beneficial? It's a pity that neither crying nor laughing can be forced. People living in this world are truly at a loss whether to cry or laugh!</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>— Qian Zui-zhu</p>
<p>"Walking" is multifaceted and also the greatest work of mankind. If not for "unceasingly walking forward," we would not have progressed from living in caves to living in tall buildings, from eating raw meat and drinking blood to cooking delicacies, from ignorance to the era of all-powerful science.</p>
<p>The more civilized society becomes, the more ways there are to walk. Recently, newspapers often feature many newly invented ways of walking. Although the paths they walk are "crooked," "winding," "diverging," and "dark," it cannot be denied that they are "walking." However, their destination is either the "Huangpu River" or a "grand hotel," walking to the "death" that is the final path in life. Although "dead end" is not very pleasant, we still have to admit that they are walking hard. Because "dead end" is also a road, and a road that everyone must take, but they are just resting earlier.</p>
<p>Since so many people walk to their deaths, the advertising costs for these missing persons advertisements are naturally very considerable. In these times of financial hardship, a method of austerity should be considered. Therefore, I have devised a "versatile advertisement" on behalf of the advertisers. Whether it is for elopement, absconding with funds, opposition to the family, etc., it can be applied. The format is as follows:</p>
<p>(XX, please be advised that since your departure, the whole family is in panic ○ crying ○ weeping, ○○ is worried sick and ill, hoping you will return home immediately, ○○ can be negotiated, ○○ will not be pursued, or communicate ○○ to relieve our anxiety</p>
<p>XX sincerely)</p>
<p>Following the above format, just fill in a few words in the circled areas, and it can be applied. For example, for "seeking a runaway wife," it is very easy to create a qualified advertisement. (…children crying and women weeping…I am worried sick and ill…everything can be negotiated…the past will not be pursued…)</p>
<p>Attached statement: This "versatile missing persons advertisement," although invented by me, is not patented. Please feel free to use it, and there will be no lawsuits.</p>
<h3>Dog Meat</h3>
<p>— Nai Ling</p>
<p>Once the north wind blows to Guangzhou, the seasonal "masked palm civets," "dragon-tiger stew," and "five-snake feast" appear in the market. These foods, famous both at home and abroad, are local specialties. While chewing the cooked meat, except for the barking of yellow dogs being a bit unsettling, it is probably not inferior to the civet meat, cat meat, and snake meat of "masked palm civets," "dragon-tiger stew," and "five-snake feast," etc.!</p>
<p>What is not available in other places, we can call it a "special" food. This "special" food is regarded by the wealthy in Guangzhou as the ultimate tonic in winter. But because its price is too high, many people are unable to try it. Therefore, inexpensive and high-quality dog meat has become a popular winter tonic for the common people.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the Bureau of Hygiene has designated dog meat as an unsanitary food, prohibiting its sale. Therefore, those who love it do not mind the trouble and travel long distances to villages outside the city.</p>
<p>In those villages, on narrow streets, there are many shops with racks full of dog meat. Inside the shops, under low ceilings, there are four or five tables no more than two feet high, and many bamboo chairs. In the center of the tables is a stove and an earthenware pot.</p>
<p>When we step into the shop, the first thing we smell is a rather fragrant, peculiar odor, and the second is the barking of yellow dogs waiting to be slaughtered in iron cages.</p>
<p>But in the end, the peculiar odor triumphs over the barking, the human heart loses its compassion, and we begin to cut the dog meat into squares and place it in a bamboo basket with a hard heart. Before the dog meat is poured into the earthenware pot, the people in the shop light a full stove of firewood, place the earthenware pot on top, and pour in prepared brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and lard to simmer. After about five minutes, the dog meat is poured from the basket into the pot. With a sizzle, the fragrance begins to spread around.</p>
<p>Several people surround the pot of dog meat, chatting and laughing while adding some ready-made dog broth. They put the lid on and wait for the dog meat to cook quickly. But only after about thirty minutes does the lid begin to jump. The earthenware lid is lifted, and before us is the fragrant dog meat, cooked until tender. Sipping mellow wine and chewing the cooked meat, apart from the barking of the yellow dogs being a bit unsettling, it is probably not inferior to the civet meat, cat meat, and snake meat of "masked palm civets," "dragon-tiger stew," and "five-snake feast," etc.!</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Divination Promises Good Fortune, the Old Man Smiles Daily; Cutting Away Sorrow is Endless, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Old Zhao was perhaps more anxious about his son's marriage than his son himself. He always wanted to bring his daughter-in-law home, as it would have several advantages. First, the marriage would not change. Second, the Zhao and Yang families could cooperate in practice. Third, he could have the opportunity to hold a grandson early. However, secretly observing the attitude of the mother and daughter, they always looked worried. His son was far away in the Xifengkou defense area, and if he opened his mouth to the Jiang family, his son might not be able to return, breaking his promise and adding another layer of guilt. Conversely, writing to his son to ask him to take leave to return, if the Yang family mother and daughter were unwilling, would also make his son unable to step down. So, although he was willing in his heart, he could not express this meaning in words. He always sat in a wicker chair with old trousers for a cushion, with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, taking a puff and exhaling, expressing his thoughtful and awaiting response look. This time, when Jiang mentioned this issue while sitting in the chair opposite him, he clapped his hands and suddenly stood up, swinging his old voice and laughing: That would be excellent. This sentence "That would be excellent" blurted out, and the two-foot-long dry tobacco pipe also blurted out, falling to the ground with a soft thud. This dry tobacco pipe of his had a bakelite mouthpiece, and falling so violently shattered it. This old man had no companions, and the dry tobacco pipe was his only companion. Breaking the tobacco pipe mouthpiece was no different from injuring his companion. From Jiang's point of view, this was an unfortunate thing. But Old Zhao paid no attention to this, casually placing the dry tobacco pipe on the tea table, and still said to Jiang: Sister-in-law, are our intentions not the same? A parent always hopes that their son's marriage will be settled early, so they can fulfill a wish. Tell me, how do you want to handle the wedding, and I will come and record it. (266)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Cell "Tian" Middle</h3>
<p>— Zu Lin</p>
<p>Looking out through the small window embedded with iron bars, one can tell that it is already dawn. If you press your face closer to the window, you will definitely feel that the air is sharp.</p>
<p>Such a stimulating morning cold wind woke up two people shackled with iron in cell "Tian". They were just startled from their dreams, feeling cold and shivering. Sleep had not yet left them, and they could not help but stretch. Other than the snoring of two other people, the air in this cell was temporarily silent.</p>
<p>The two people's gazes suddenly met, and they gave each other a bitter sigh. Then they began their first conversation of the day.</p>
<p>"Damn it—not comfortable at all. A-Si brother, did you sleep well?"</p>
<p>"Ugh! The cold air is terrible, almost freezing me to death."</p>
<p>The hemp bag that served as bedding, or rather, as a coat, moved, causing another resonance of iron implements.</p>
<p>Yi Laowu felt a change in the contents of his crotch, as if he had an indication that he needed to urinate. He got up angrily, causing his heavy shackles to clang and clatter.</p>
<p>He squatted on a wooden bucket with several obvious leaks and relieved himself. At the same time, a wave of foul-smelling urine wafted up. In a cell that could only accommodate four people, in the left corner of the doorway, there was also a stinky latrine that made people want to vomit. Straw piled on the ground, with moisture constantly seeping from beneath, mixed with people's body odor, forming an indescribable smell. On the previous night, they were not accustomed to it, but once they arrived here, they had to endure it whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>At this time, A-Si brother had already turned over. The other two had not yet woken up. Yi Laowu turned around, saw the light, sighed, slowly lay down, put the hemp bag on his body, and felt his head was dizzy.</p>
<p>The shiny silver dollars seemed to be flashing before his legs. The past could not help but reappear in his mind.</p>
<p>The little wild chicken's arms were as white as tender lotus roots. How could I say? This old man was ruined by those white arms! I was just enjoying myself when suddenly several soldiers came, and a child. Damn it! They said this old man was a bandit. Iron chains were put around my neck, and without explanation, they took me away. It was only a few days before they found out! Why! How did that little kid not die? He must have leaked the news.</p>
<p>After running for several years, I finally gained some reputation in the underworld. I even became a squad leader once and looted several guns. Over the years, I don't know how many cases we committed on the Si Hu River. We ate meat in large chunks and divided gold in large scales. We never ran into trouble. This time, something had to happen. If we hadn't drowned those sheep in the boat, such a big thing wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>The next day after the crime, I heard people talking about it in the teahouse. Damn it! What Hu Fu, still a student! Ah! It's coming back to me, that young man in the blue cloth gown, wasn't he Hu Fu? At that time, this old man wouldn't have shown any mercy! I don't care if you're a student, this old man wants money. Even if you have ten wives at home, if you stir up this old man's anger, I'll still do it. Killing a few people is nothing. But this time it wasn't lucrative. There were only two hundred dollars in total. Damn it! And it made this old man suffer. What a mess! As he thought this, he felt an unnamed fire burning in his heart. At the same time, the other two had already gotten up, and the clang of their shackles was even louder than before, forming a kind of musical confession. It immediately interrupted his reminiscence, and his body began to ache.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone through the window, fully illuminating Yi Laowu's face. At this time, he was very reluctant to recall his past crimes. A-Si brother was busy catching lice on his short shirt. The two had been talking energetically. Before long, a soldier brought in food: a bowl of dull yellow vegetables and coarse, undercooked rice, placed on the straw. Each of them got a large bowl. Due to the pressure of hunger, they had no choice but to eat.</p>
<p>The heat of the sun illuminated their breakfast, as if smiling ferociously at them.</p>

The construction of school buildings has been successively approved for 130,000 yuan, and the start of construction is imminent. Please allocate the funds quickly. 2. Please expedite the review and approval of the budget.

The current year has been reduced by 30,000 yuan, and temporary expenses have been reduced by 9,000 yuan per year.

<h3>Weng Zhilong, President of National Tongji University, Discusses the Property Dispute of Senior Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>The senior vocational school attached to National Tongji University in Jiangwan has been repeatedly reported in local newspapers due to a property dispute. Yesterday, Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, gave a speech on the history and latest situation of the matter:</p>
<p>The senior vocational school established by our university in Jiangwan is using part of the former Labor University's property in Jiangwan. The 354th meeting of the Central Political Council allocated it to our university for takeover. After our university received the order from the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan to take over, we followed the order of the Ministry of Education and established the senior vocational school. There are now more than one hundred students in the civil engineering and mechanical engineering departments. The faculty and staff hired are all specialized talents who have studied in various countries. Although it is still in its initial stage, the results are already considerable. This can be gratifying to the government and those in the community who are enthusiastic about promoting vocational education. The current plan is to add a dispensing department to cultivate dispensing talents in the pharmaceutical industry. The Labor University's school buildings were bombarded by the Japanese army during the January 28th Incident, and bricks and rubble were everywhere. They were dilapidated and had been garrisoned by the army twice. All the equipment was damaged. Our university spent tens of thousands of yuan to repair and renovate, and add equipment before it could be put in order and roughly restored to its former appearance. This is the process of our university taking over the property of the Labor University in accordance with laws and regulations and establishing the senior vocational school. However, the Labor University's school buildings were mortgaged to the Shanghai China General Chamber of Commerce Bank during the era of the former vagrant model factories. After the Labor University opened, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank repeatedly negotiated with the Labor University, but to no avail. Therefore, it filed a lawsuit with the court. After the Labor University was closed, the Ministry of Education organized a management committee to manage the former Labor University's property. The bank continued to file lawsuits, and recently the court ruled that the property would be seized. The university believes that the occurrence of this incident will have a great impact on the foundation of the attached senior vocational school. The author has repeatedly gone to Beijing to present the matter to the Ministry of Education and ask for instructions on how to handle it in order to maintain the production education that is urgently needed in our country. I also asked Mr. Song Wusheng to conduct reconciliation, but the bank's conditions were harsh and difficult to accept in fact. We also invited the bank to hold direct negotiations between the two parties so that their opinions could be reconciled. However, the bank refused and insisted on being a creditor. In fact, from the perspective of Tongji University, the takeover of part of the Labor University's property and the use of the Labor University's school buildings were completely done in accordance with orders. The property of the former vagrant model factories was established by the Shanghai Political Branch in accordance with the measures for handling public property when the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai during the Northern Expedition. The transfer of property has been transferred many times to this day. Our university is not the subject of the debt. This is clear. Moreover, this debt has long been handed over by the central government to the Ministry of Finance's Committee for the Reorganization of Domestic and Foreign Debt for overall handling. The transfer of debt is a uniform measure by the Ministry of Finance to handle the correct or potentially considered various debts of public and private institutions of the government before the revolution. This disposition measure has special characteristics and is very different from the transfer of general debt. If ordinary legal sanctions are used, there are many practical obstacles. Therefore, this debt has nothing to do with our university. The reason why our university is trying to compromise and negotiate with the bank is to take into account the importance of production education and to prevent the vocational school, which has already been on the right track in a very short period of time, from being unable to settle down, which would affect the progress of their studies. The bank has insisted repeatedly, which is regrettable. Furthermore, the land mortgaged to the bank has buildings such as office buildings, gymnasiums, dormitories, and bell towers built on the part used by our university during the Labor University era. After our university took over, it was greatly repaired, and the factory machines were repaired and reorganized, which cost a lot. The increased value on the ground and the repair and addition of machinery cannot be completed by mere seizure. The bank, as a financial institution, should uphold the government's intention to support production undertakings and revitalize production education as its responsibility, and should not treat it as a normal debt-debt handling method in commerce, which would cause other misunderstandings. Currently, the faculty and students of the affiliated vocational school are indignant at the righteous debt and have spontaneously organized a school protection association to resolutely oppose it. The crowd is angry, and the sounds of study will fall into stagnation. The author is eager for this unfortunate incident to be resolved as soon as possible so that it will not expand further. At the same time, I deeply hope that the national education community and people in society who promote vocational education will give it sympathetic assistance and visit and provide guidance at any time so that society can learn the truth after the establishment of our university. I would be very grateful.</p>

<h3>English "Thirty Anecdotes of China" Bestseller</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yiting, an English expert in Shanghai, has recently compiled "Thirty Anecdotes of China," which is taken from popular novels such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Flowers in the Mirror," and "Liaozhai Zhiyi." After publication, it was adopted as a textbook by famous middle schools in China. The first edition was sold out in less than two months and has now been reprinted. The book has received good reviews from various Western newspapers in Shanghai, such as the North-China Daily News, which commented that "If Chinese middle school students want to learn fluent English, this book is an excellent teacher, because the writing style of the whole book is concise and avoids the use of difficult words, difficult sentences, and superfluous words." This is indeed an accurate comment. It is said that the book sells for seven jiao in foreign currency and is published by the Shanghai Commercial Press.</p>

<h3>A Large Stadium Planned for the City Center</h3>
<p>- An investment of one million covering three hundred mu - This city is a world-famous market where merchants from various countries gather and cultural institutions stand in great numbers, but large-scale stadiums, museums, libraries, hospitals, etc., are still lacking, which is a great regret. Now, in order to actively develop the city's culture, the municipal government plans to build a large-scale stadium, museum, and library in the city center, with a planned investment of two million yuan, one million yuan for the stadium, thirty thousand yuan for the museum, thirty thousand yuan for the library, and forty thousand yuan for the hospital. The above figures are limited to construction costs. The preliminary plan is to draft plans, draw drawings, and actively prepare to proceed. Construction can begin around June. Among them, the stadium is progressing most actively and is also the largest in scale, covering an area of 300 mu. Although the construction cost is only one million yuan, the location will be the park in the city center, so there is no need to purchase additional land. It is said that after the stadium is completed in the future, its grand scale will exceed the Nanjing Central Stadium. It is heard that the Second National Games in 1935 and the Far Eastern Games in 1937 are both scheduled to be held here.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Football Final - Jinan vs. Jiaotong University Imminent</h3>
<p>▲This Saturday at Xujiahui</p>
<p>▲Tickets printed and distributed to various circles. This year's Jiangnan University Sports Association Football Championship has been underway for a long time. The universities with the highest hopes for winning the championship are Jinan, Jiaotong, and Fudan. Fudan only lost to Jiaotong and has not yet played against Jinan. Jinan has repeatedly defeated schools such as Datong, Guanghua, Jinling, and Central. Jiaotong has successively defeated schools such as Fudan and Guanghua University. Both teams have been victorious in every match, each harboring ambitions to win the championship. This Saturday (the 16th), the two schools will meet at the Jiaotong University field in Xujiahui. This match is nothing less than a championship decider, and both teams are full of talent and have long enjoyed a strong reputation. Once they clash, there will surely be many exciting moments. It is expected that there will be a large number of spectators. Jiaotong University has already printed many admission tickets, all of which are free of charge. Besides a portion being distributed by Jinan to its students and alumni, Jiaotong University alumni and people from outside the university who wish to obtain tickets can contact the Nanyang Alumni Association at the Mainland Department Store on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Results of the First Day of the Third Round of the Third International Table Tennis Public Exhibition Cup</h3>
<p>▲Western Team Wins by Three Points, Chinese Team by Two Points</p>
<p>▲Today's Singles Matches are Crucial. Yesterday was the first day of the third round of this year's Public Exhibition Cup. The Chinese and Western teams gave their all to secure victory, resulting in all five singles matches becoming hard-fought battles, setting a precedent. As a result, the Western team only led by one point. The Chinese team has more opportunities today and will surely catch up. Yesterday, in the first match, Zhu Kuan lost the first game, but immediately recovered in the second game. In the third game, Mr. Kleimeyer was exhausted, eventually leading to his defeat. The match between Cha Hong was very watchable. Mr. Cha won the first game, but lost the second game to Mr. Hong. In the third game, Mr. Hong seized the opportunity to advance aggressively, eventually leading with a score of 20 to 19. However, due to bad luck, Mr. Cha scored two consecutive points, leading to his defeat. In the fifth match, veteran Mr. Sun was cautious from beginning to end. His killing skills were as good as ever, so he was able to overcome a strong enemy with a score of 2 to 0. In the seventh match, Mr. Pearson's right-handed kill was quite good. Although Mr. Cheng fought hard, he still lost. In the ninth match, Mr. Yan lost the first game, and tried hard to recover in the second game. However, due to a leg injury, he was unable to perform to his full potential in the third game and lost. The results are attached below:</p>
<p>(1) Zhu Kuan (Chinese) - 21-14 - Kleimeyer (Western)… 2 to 1</p>

<h3>This Year's International Walking Race Restores Positions - McKenna Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>The second and third place finishers in the International Walking Race were initially disqualified for improper form at the Yi Yuan finish line. However, their positions were later restored. A reporter interviewed Mr. McKenna, a Westerner from the association, about this matter yesterday. According to Mr. McKenna, the Chinese participants had correct form and there were no points of criticism from beginning to end, which he greatly admired. The second and third place Westerners abandoned walking and ran before the finish line, which was witnessed by all. He believed that their positions should be cancelled. However, some referees disagreed, and despite his strong arguments, he was ultimately unsuccessful. Mr. McKenna also expressed his dissatisfaction with this matter.</p>
<h3>Zhanghua Company Basketball Team Established</h3>
<p>Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company, a giant of national products, was founded by Liu Hongsheng and others. With its sound organization and far-sighted vision, its business is thriving. The domestically produced woolen fabrics recently released have attracted the attention of foreigners and are praised at home and abroad. The factory is large in scale, and there are many sports enthusiasts among its employees.</p>
<p>[P&gt;Zhanghua Basketball Team Hosts Banquet for Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>To avoid idleness, there were original practices after work. Now, in addition to the existing football team, a basketball team has also been formed. The other night, a banquet was held at the Bank Club to formally announce the establishment of the team. Reporters from various newspapers were invited, including Shen Meizhen, Sun Daosheng, Pei Shunyuan, Jiang Huaiqing, Shen Zhenchao, Zhang Huiqing, Qu Yue, Yang Yucheng, Mao Fangmei, Xia Kaiming, Zhang Shengzhi, and others, more than ten people in total. Old friends reunited, shook hands, and took commemorative photos. Halfway through the banquet, Manager Cheng Nianpeng had another engagement and was represented by Qian Yun as chairman, who delivered a speech, briefly stating that the factory was entirely founded by Chinese people, and they were very honored that their products were trusted by the Chinese people. However, in order to continuously improve, they were not complacent and would have even greater developments to breathe life into the national products industry. He hoped that everyone would provide guidance. Today, with the establishment of the Zhanghua Basketball Team, he especially hoped that everyone present would offer some suggestions. The reporters, being fellow Chinese people and long-time advocates of both national products and sports, applauded and supported the factory, recognizing it as a very ambitious force in the national products industry with unlimited prospects, which all compatriots across the country would be happy to hear about. The banquet ended at 9 PM, with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves. The official roster of the team is listed on the left: Team Leader Cheng Pengnian, Secretary Hua Erkang, Captain Qian Yun, and team members Lu Zhongen, Feng Nianhua, Wu Guolin, Sun Baoqing, Lu Zhonghui, Chen Xianglong, and Qian Jingyong.</p>

<h3>Distinguishing Critics</h3>
<p>— Lushuang</p>
<p>Nowadays, when one mentions "critic," people imagine a cold and stern face—furrowed eyebrows, (piercing) eyes, an unforgiving mouth; moreover, (wielding a pen like a mighty beam), finding fault with everything, this isn't good, that isn't right, a third thing is insufficient; in short, more criticism than praise.</p>
<p>This is naturally a (fantasy). Critics aren't people whose brains are structured differently, who specialize in (picking bones from tofu), who necessarily turn good things into bad; a critic is merely (in their professional capacity), unable to compromise and follow the crowd. A truly responsible critic, if forced to criticize more than praise, must feel a pang of sorrow, for his joy lies in discovering and reading great works, and recommending them, certainly not in tearing everything down.</p>
<p>There are also (critics) in the world who can't see anything good; they scold (the petty bourgeoisie) for being too vulgar, and they're also dissatisfied with people who relentlessly pursue an ideal, deeming them too idealistic. Such critics are so-called (nihilistic) critics. There have been many such critics in the history of Western literature, but they can't truly (be nihilistic), tearing down everything; they still praise nihilistic works.</p>
<p>I recall a story about a play on stage portraying Cao Cao. A woodcutter, upon seeing Cao Cao appear, was overcome with rage, jumped onto the stage, and killed him with an axe. There's a similar story from the Middle Ages in the West: the killer was a peasant, and the victim played Judas, who betrayed Jesus. Though Cao Cao and Judas are killable, the woodcutter or peasant mistakenly thought the author was advocating for the characters' actions, assuming the thoughts of the characters in the book were the author's thoughts, and thus the (punishment of the axe) was almost directed at the author.</p>
<p>In a chaotic society, the former type of critic often gains the title of most (thorough), while the latter type often gains the title of most (courageous). With many (thorough) and (courageous) individuals, critics are thus generally misunderstood as cold, frightening, and solely focused on nitpicking (fault-finding), which isn't accidental!</p>
<h3>A Record of Peril at Xianxia</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Journeying south from Quzhou, one is constantly greeted by verdant mountains, surpassing even the azure rivers in hue. Traversing a vast plain, passing the Twin Pagoda, one arrives at a walled city ensconced by four mountains – Jiangshan County.</p>
<p>Jiangshan is renowned for its Jianglang Mountain with its three towering rocks. Crossing Xianxia Pass southwards leads directly to Fujian and Guangdong; heading west to Yushan reaches Jiangxi. Being a nexus of seven provinces, Jiangshan is indeed a crucial border post. In these times of turmoil and famine, the apprehension and timidity of the people of Jiangshan County can be readily imagined. Our journey southward is merely to witness the perilousness of Xianxia Pass; indulging in local customs, leisurely strolls amidst nature, and water-side excursions are luxuries ill-afforded this year. Thus, on the second day in Jiangshan, we hastily chartered a car to Xianxia Pass.</p>
<p>Boarding the car outside the South Gate station, three li brought us to Jingxing Mountain, locally known as Dongyue Mountain, beneath which lies Tiger Rock and a pagoda erected during the Ming dynasty's Jiajing era. Twenty li southwards, the soaring Jianglang Mountain, with its three colossal rocks, vaguely comes into view, now coalescing, now separating, leaping amongst the eastern mountains. Further along are Yutou, Gorge Mouth, and the Xianxia Ridge area. Despite the journey to Jiangshan being eighty or ninety li, the car traversed it in merely two or three hours.</p>
<p>The countenance of Xianxia Ridge is truly magnificent – from afar, one perceives the vast Xianxia mountain range stretching for a hundred li; closer inspection reveals an impenetrable veil of sky. On the east, west, and south sides, valleys within valleys, mountains upon mountains abound: countless peculiar peaks, strange rocks, ancient trees, and lengthy vines. Most tortuous and confusing, defying all sense of direction, is the newly constructed highway from Guanwai's Twenty-Eighth Township, tracing the Dragon Creek and Transforming Dragon Creek, two major rivers in the deep mountains, leading to Jiangshan.</p>
<p>Every five steps a turn, every three steps a climb; on one side a swirling abyss of ten thousand fathoms, on the other a precipice of a thousand layers unreachable by birds. Each turn unveils a new vista, each climb reveals a new realm. Ascending and descending, going to and fro, we journeyed through the Xianxia mountains, along the Dragon Creek banks, heading south from the north, circumnavigating Xianxia Pass; the car traversed the mountain road for a full hour. The mountain's height, the water's depth, the plethora of turns, the road's peril – described unreservedly, it surpasses Hangzhou's Nine Creeks and Eighteen Ravines by at least three hundredfold. To witness the winding mountains and waters, to test the road's ruggedness, to gamble with life and fortune, to taste the extraordinary thrill of a life-or-death adventure, Xianxia Ridge is a must-visit, especially the newly constructed highway that circles from Xianxia Pass's northern foothills, exiting the pass and ascending to the Twenty-Eighth Township south of the pass. As the car reached Pidan, passing the narrow pass of Xiaowu Ridge, peering down at the residences at the bottom of the Twenty-Eighth Township Valley, and gazing at the azure shadows of Pucheng's Maple Ridge peaks in the distance, I truly experienced an indescribable sentiment – a mixture of joy and fear. Joy at having traversed many perilous passes beyond the pass, and fear at the direct view of the destination, the Twenty-Eighth Township at the foot of the mountain, though separated by merely the space of a catapult shot, the mountain slope is steep and sheer, plummeting down some two or three thousand feet. Turning back to look at Xianxia Pass at this moment, a former bird path paved with stone steps resembling a snake's belly is already hidden high amidst the clouds and trees.</p>
<p>Descending from Xiaowu Ridge's narrow pass, circling and winding for another thirty or forty minutes, arriving at the Twenty-Eighth Township outside Xianxia Pass, a wave of goosebumps suddenly erupted upon everyone's skin.</p>
<p>The sun was clearly shining brightly, the sky was naturally azure, and the tall residences were arranged layer upon layer, but the people – the living, breathing people – where had they all gone?</p>
<p>Many neat residences had windows shut, but doors ajar, half-open, or even yawning open, resembling the mouths of dead bass. Stepping inside revealed only scattered straw on the ground. The echo of footsteps reverberating in the empty house filled one with fear. Suddenly, a rustling in the dark corner of the room, amidst the straw, would occasionally rouse a person, but with only bare eyes, they would size you up and silently evade. If you pursued them with a question, they would reluctantly stop, give you another bare-eyed assessment, shake their head, reveal a ghastly smile, and then depart, uttering not a single word. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rural Scenery</h3>
<p>— He Deming</p>
<p>Little Scabby was dazed on the straw pile. The sun was setting in the western hills, and the cows were mooing, but he paid no attention. Only those dark eyes, like two stars, kept flashing before him.</p>
<p>(Ah Qiao, that little girl! She's got some flavour.)</p>
<p>He blurted this out involuntarily, his mind clearing. Seeing that the sky was getting dark, he quickly stood up, took his sickle, and led the cow home. Just as he approached the fence, he ran into Ah Qiao.</p>
<p>(Little Scabby, you're back! Why so late?)</p>
<p>She said, laughing all the while.</p>
<p>(Sister Ah Qiao, …)</p>
<p>Little Scabby couldn't find the words, just staring at her.</p>
<p>(Hurry inside, don't let Brother Ah Niu see you again, or you'll get a slap.)</p>
<p>She still kept laughing. As soon as Little Scabby heard her mention her fiancé, Brother Ah Niu, he became unhappy. He glared at Ah Qiao fiercely and went inside.</p>
<p>In the evening, Ah Qiao was cooking in the kitchen. Little Scabby was enthusiastically throwing bundles of bean husks into the stove, feeling an indescribable comfort in his heart. His eyes, like a hungry wolf, kept darting towards Ah Qiao's face, her body, … from top to bottom, from right to left, circling, circling.</p>
<p>(You rascal! Why are you staring at me? I don't have flowers growing on me.)</p>
<p>Ah Qiao raised the tongs, feigning anger, wanting to hit Little Scabby.</p>
<p>(If you don't look at me, how would I know I'm looking at you?)</p>
<p>Little Scabby said, grinning slyly, while picking up a pine cone from the woodpile and throwing it, hitting her cheek.</p>
<p>(Ouch… Damn it!)</p>
<p>She touched her face, blushing.</p>
<p>(Ha… ha… hee… hee…)</p>
<p>Little Scabby laughed until he couldn't breathe. Just as they were laughing, Brother Ah Niu suddenly ran in.</p>
<p>(What are you laughing about again? Hurry up and take the dishes out!)</p>
<p>He looked at Little Scabby under the stove and said:</p>
<p>(Always making a racket, I'll feed you willow branches!)</p>
<p>Little Scabby pouted, ignoring him.</p>
<p>He left. The kitchen was silent, with only the sound of boiling oil and the crackling of bean husks.</p>
<h3>Notes from a Guest's Window</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Fifteen</p>
<p>Many articles from the past, if well-edited, often become more excellent than the original. Especially with descriptive articles, removing those pedantic arguments and vulgar beginnings and endings, they can almost become masterpieces. I personally enjoy doing this very much. For example, Wang Heng's "Record of Watching Peach Blossoms at the East Gate," I once removed the beginning and ending of the full text, making it into the following short piece:</p>
<p>My nature is uniquely fond of peach blossoms, and I never fail to visit them every spring, and I always go to remote places. On the seventeenth day of the second month this year, I made an appointment with Ru Zeng, sending someone to explore the four corners of the city, asking where the flowers were blooming and going there. They reported that the East Gate was good, so I walked out of the East Gate, stepping through rapeseed flowers, and saw a village residence with some willows and peach trees to admire, so the wine jars and mats were set up in order. The residence was in a small stream, with peach blossoms on either side. There were about thirty or forty trees on the stream, very tender and beautiful. Then we moved to the Wu family's estate, where the estate and pond were intertwined. It was similar to before, but five times as large. The flowers were large and abundant, with a scarlet color in the middle, especially the ones by the water. Several tall poplars stood outside the pond, like great men in official attire, guarding young women inside. The peach blossoms were also drunk, drooping their faces, washing their makeup by the water, not easily showing their foreheads. We drank under the trees for a long time.</p>
<p>This can be said to be a wonderfully concise descriptive piece. However, the original text was as long as 505 characters, with the opening taking up 35 characters and the later vulgar and pedantic arguments taking up 289 characters. Removing 324 characters, leaving 181 characters, makes it into this article. For many works from the past, I think those studying ancient books can put in some effort to organize them in this way. But my intention is not to have everyone be fascinated by ancient bones. Fascination with ancient bones is very different from the study of ancient books.</p>
<h3>The Two Brothers (57)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Li Weike, Written by Maupassant</p>
<p>Since receiving the inheritance, Zheran had been considering every day whether or not to marry her. Every time he saw her, he felt he had decided to take her as his wife, but then, when he was left alone, he thought he might as well take his time to consider it again. Now she was not as wealthy as him, because she only had an income of about twelve thousand francs a year, but her wealth was all real estate, land in the Le Havre basin; and such real estate would be worth a great deal of money in the future. In this light, their assets were about the same, and he really liked the young widow.</p>
<p>This day, watching her walk ahead, he thought to himself: (Okay, I have to decide. I certainly won't find anyone better than her.)</p>
<p>They advanced along a sloping valley that descended from the village to the cliff: the peak of the cliff overlooked the sea at the end of this valley at a height of eighty meters. In the frame of the green coast that sloped down to the left and right, a triangular piece of water, as blue as silver in the sun, appeared in the distance, and a sailboat that was almost invisible floated there like an insect. The sky and the sea, full of sunlight, were not mixed together, and it was simply impossible to distinguish their boundaries: the two women who walked in front of the three men drew their figures wrapped in short clothes on this bright horizon.</p>
<p>Zheran's eyes were bright, watching Mrs. Lumei's slender ankles, delicate legs, graceful waist, dazzling large straw hat, etc., flee in front of him. This kind of escape further aroused his desire, gradually adopting the kind of determination that hesitant and cowardly people suddenly adopt. And the warm air mixed with the scent of the coast, Ajone, alfalfa and grass, and the fishy smell of the rocks exposed on the water, slowly intoxicated him on the one hand, and made him more excited on the other hand. With every step he took, every second he passed, and every time he looked at the lively figure of the young woman, he became more and more determined: he decided not to hesitate any longer, and decided to tell her that he loved her and wanted to marry her. Shrimp hunting could be used by him, making it easy for them to have a chance to whisper; and this was also a beautiful environment, a beautiful place to talk about love, inserting their feet into the depression filled with clear water, and watching the long whiskers of the sea shrimp escape under the seaweed.</p>
<p>When they reached the end of the valley, to the edge of the abyss, they saw a narrow goat path descending along the cliff. At their feet, between the sea and the foothills, near the mountainside on the left, was a pile of amazing boulders, collapsed, collapsed, and piled in a mess on a undulating plain covered with grass, which ran south until it disappeared. This plain, which was caused by the collapse of the coast in the past, was covered with thorns and swaying shallow grass. The rocks that fell from the volcanic eruption looked like the ruins of a large city of endless white walls that had disappeared from the coast and overlooked the ocean.</p>
<p>(Ah, this is so beautiful,) Mrs. Lu stopped and said.</p>
<p>Zheran caught up with her, his heart pounding, and reached out to help her down the narrow stairs carved into the rock.</p>
<p>They walked in front, while Captain Boqiru fixed his body on those two short legs, stretched out his bent arm to Mrs. Roland, who was dizzy with the abyss.</p>
<p>Roland and Bill went down last. The doctor had to lead his father, Roland, who was simply so dizzy that he had to let his son drag him down one step at a time.</p>

<h3>Jiang Customs Silver Bullion Soars Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver bars continued to rise, increasing by another five yuan compared to the previous day. The morning market price was 857 yuan, and the afternoon market price was 860 yuan, the highest price in the latter half of the year. The trading volume was 10,500 taels in the morning and 14,000 taels in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver bars traded at 802.2 yuan in the morning and 800.05 yuan in the afternoon, a further decrease of 2.7 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The trading volume was 65,000 taels in the morning and 85,000 taels in the afternoon. Copper coins were shortened by 3,000 wen, to 292 strings of wen, with 32,704 strings traded. In addition, substitute silver dollars totaled 11,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: Major Players Accumulate, Public Bonds Rise</p>
<p>▲ Possible Short Squeeze in This Month's Contracts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a reverse trend from the previous day, with prices rising steadily. Major players were actively buying, and swap transactions were also lively. The trend indicates a possible continuation of the price increase. The financial sector is under strict scrutiny by the Ministry of Finance, and due to year-end accounting, funds are being held rather than released. In terms of the political situation, the Guangdong faction is gradually moving closer to the central government, and the Fujian situation lacks the potential for external development due to various factors. Rumors about political instability are unfounded. In terms of trading volume, there are currently several accounts with a combined balance of 3.3 million taels for this month. It is reported that several firms, including a certain company, plan to acquire approximately 1.5 million taels. One or two major sellers, who delivered spot goods last month in significant amounts, are unlikely to deliver all goods this month. Therefore, a short squeeze is still possible. The overall situation is expected to become clearer soon, especially as the delivery date for this month's futures approaches. The volatility is expected to increase further, so we should wait and see. Yesterday morning's two trading sessions saw prices start small and then rise, followed by prices starting high and then falling in the second session, still in a chaotic and fluctuating state. Trading volume was slightly lower than before, mostly consisting of swap transactions. In the afternoon, major players actively bought, with significant purchases in Nos. 23, 46, and 53 contracts, causing a sudden shift towards an upward trend. Prices generally rose by several jiao to over one yuan. As a result, apart from the December contract, where Nos. 18 and Jin Chang saw slight decreases of two or three jiao to six or seven jiao, all other contracts rose by several jiao to around one yuan. The December salt tax contract alone rose by 1.4 yuan. The total trading volume was 17.78 million yuan, with no spot trades open. The total futures volume, including salt tax, was 6.43 million yuan, demobilization accounted for 3.985 million yuan, No. 19 Customs duty accounted for 2.08 million yuan, and Nos. 20 and 20 Customs duty accounted for 2.635 million yuan, with the remaining contracts ranging from tens of thousands to millions.</p>
<p>US Dollar Strong in New York Stock Market</p>
<p>The New Fung Yang Bank reported on the 11th that the New York stock market initially rose sharply, by as much as five yuan, due to favorable commercial reports. However, as the gold price remained unchanged and the US dollar strengthened, bulls took profits, leading to mixed market conditions. The total daily trading volume was 2.43 million shares. The US dollar's strength was attributed to rumors of stabilization, including reports from Paris that the US Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of France had discussed the preconditions for stabilizing the US dollar and the British pound. However, according to an official from the State Department, the United States had not taken such action, and the stabilization of the US dollar remains a future issue. Furthermore, steel companies reported that steel production has increased to 31.5%, the highest level since October 23, due to the completion of fourth-quarter orders and increased purchases by the automobile industry in preparation for manufacturing new models.</p>
<p>(Wheat) The extremely cold weather poses a risk to winter wheat, so buy when prices fall.</p>
<p>(Cotton) The market is stable, and increasing commercial progress reports have boosted confidence. The Financial Relief Society purchased gold at a price of 34.01 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cloth: Anti-Dumping Tax Causes Stir in the Yarn and Cloth Market</p>
<p>The yarn market opened with a significant surge in the morning, showing strong momentum. Reports indicated that the National Government had decided to implement ten types of anti-dumping taxes starting from January 1, 1934, with cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth being the major items. This prompted speculative activity and large-scale purchases, causing the market to rise by over three yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that sales of spot yarn remained sluggish, and prices for various months slightly fell by seven to nine jiao. Given that the yarn market's base is at a low point, the rapid changes make it difficult to predict.</p>

<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, with bullish sentiment intensifying due to anti-dumping concerns and market rumors. Small investors resisted short positions, further boosting the market. However, spot cotton mills remained sluggish. According to sources, cotton production in various regions is abundant.

<p>Flour and Wheat Prices Rise Together, Grain Prices Increase</p>
<p>Tax on foreign wheat will be implemented</p>
<p>Flour Market: After the market opened in the morning, the prices for various months saw a jump, with the price of foreign wheat generally improving by about one jiao. The anticipation of increased taxes also fueled activity, causing market sentiment to be exceptionally bullish. The opening prices for the current month and distant months increased by about three fen compared to the previous day. Trading was particularly active at that time. However, in the second session, manufacturers took advantage of the situation to actively sell off their stocks, causing market sentiment to soften by 0.01 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month's contract briefly broke through the 0.03 yuan mark due to some buying from customer guilds. Market rumors that the tax on foreign wheat would be implemented, with an actual increase of 0.54 yuan per dan, and the rise in futures prices greatly impacted market sentiment. However, major manufacturers continued to release stocks, causing the situation to ease again. As a result, the current month's contract rose by 0.0325 yuan compared to the previous day, the January-February contract rose by 0.0225 yuan, the March-April contract rose by 0.025 yuan, and the May contract rose by 0.0275 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: After the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices for various months saw a uniform surge. In the morning sessions, the price of foreign wheat improved by another jiao, and because there were few sellers, bullish sentiment was exceptionally strong. Therefore, opening prices for all months, especially distant months, improved by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was rumored that the tax on foreign wheat would be implemented and announced soon, with a tax rate of 0.54 yuan. As a result, market sentiment inside and outside the industry turned more expensive, and there was active buying of distant months' contracts. Because there was no limit on purchase prices, the market expanded step by step. This situation was indeed driven by the increased tax. As a result, the current month's contract rose by 0.04 yuan, the January-February contract rose by 0.1 yuan, the March contract rose by 0.12 yuan, and the April contract rose by a significant 0.15 yuan. Spot wheat trading was very quiet, with only 250 bags of Bengbu wheat opened throughout the city at a price of 4.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick Japonica Rice Sales Are Good on the Street</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 60 sources from various guilds (with only 7-8,000 shi of goods). The late rice market was similar to before, and the customer guilds' purchases were also the same, totaling nearly 3,000 bags. Therefore, the market situation was stable. The prices of green corner, Songsi, Shipu, Chonggu, Fengjing, Xilian, and Nangang late rice were all unchanged. The thick Japonica rice and Du Yangjian rice purchased by Chang Bang, Su Tong Bang, and Nangang on this street sold well. Therefore, although a large amount of goods arrived, the market situation was still stable. Shady and variable yuan payments were still sluggish.</p>

<p>The customer in sen office still popular, the market is very good, the said tax on foreign rice, has been confirmed by various parties, but the most needed areas of foreign rice in Fujian and Guangdong may need to set another way, so rice merchants did not pay attention to the tax on foreign rice, but the owners are upward thinking, the previous deposit of foreign rice also has the intention to sell, the street has also paid a little attention to the deposited foreign rice, yesterday's street made a small winding of 200 bags, the price of 7 yuan 2 corners and a half, compared with the previous month's selling price has been a greater than 2 corners, the street also made 200 bags of Hunan coarse Jing, the price of 5 yuan 9 corners, customer sales still mainly in Fujian sales, Xiamen gang more greedy in the Fujian gang, counting the purchase of Wuxi machine rice 245 bags, the price of 6 yuan 9 corners and 7 cents to 6 yuan 9 corners, Nanjing machine rice 220 bags, the price of 5 yuan 6 corners and 7 cents, Hunan oil rice 300 bags, the price of 7 yuan 4 corners and a half, machine Jing 100 bags, the price of 6 yuan 6 corners and 7 cents, Fuzhou office again pale, yesterday and the Ningbo gang jointly made 500 bags of Wuhu machine yuan, the other no transaction, the market is similar to the previous market, but the market is tight again, tax on foreign rice is 2 yuan per dan in national currency, each stone need 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Powder Green Beans Sell Uninterruptedly ▲ Market Stock 24,500 Bags</p>
<p>The green bean market has been unchanged for a long time, the source is not connected, various gangs continue to move, so the market is stable, so that the bottom of the market still Gu various green about 24,500 bags, and the powder green is less than the vegetable green, so the powder green market sees an advantage, yesterday the Fuzhou gang made more than 180 bags of large-grain green in Lihuai Pass, the price opened 4 yuan and 2 corners, more than 160 bags of small-grain, the price sold 3 yuan and 6 corners and a half.</p>
<p>Grain and Sugar Markets Follow Gold Price Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw rising gold and customs duties, tightening the trend. The guild's panel set the price of No. 24 raw sugar white common goods at 19.95 yuan, up half a jiao from the previous day. Transshipment goods were priced at 7.1 yuan, up one jiao. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red transshipment goods opened at 7 yuan. Taikoo sugar also rose by 0.05 yuan, with B mark at 20.25 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white sugar was 18.9 yuan, No. 2 was 7 jiao, No. 3 was 5 jiao, and No. 4 was 3 jiao, all up 0.05 yuan. New Chaoqing continued to open at over 400 bags, priced at 15.3 to 14.8 yuan, unchanged. It is reported that there are already 2,000 bags in the area, to be shipped on the Yisheng Wheel, expected to arrive in Shanghai around Thursday or Friday this week. The factory's top-grade ice flower green opened at over 200 bags, priced at 15.8 yuan. Medium-sized Guangbing opened at over 90 bags, priced at 22.9 yuan.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Zhangzhou Longan Remains Stagnant</p>
<p>Due to a poor harvest this year, the first batch of genuine Zhangzhou longan was priced as high as 50 yuan. However, the market soon became stagnant due to the large influx of Xingquan longan. Therefore, the subsequent batches have not yet been released. According to market prices, the difference between the front and rear batches is over 10 yuan. Recent transactions have been sporadic, and prices need to fall by at least 8-9 yuan before a deal can be made.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Eastern Biji Suddenly Plummets Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the dumping of Eastern goods, comparable Western woolens have frequently fallen in price, especially striped thin flannels and plain blue-gray serge. Recently, due to the cold weather, sales of thin flannels and serge have been sluggish. The end of the year has tightened credit, reducing demand. In addition, customer guilds have suspended operations, public funds are being strictly investigated, and export permits are difficult to obtain fraudulently. Japanese companies are urging payment, requiring settlements within the deadline, otherwise, the previously paid deposits will be forfeited, and new batches of goods are arriving in large quantities. Due to this tax situation, prices have plummeted, and those holding goods have been forced to undercut each other. As a result, they still cannot sell out completely. Yesterday, it was learned that selling a box of Eastern serge would result in a loss of 30-40 yuan, while selling a piece of thin flannel would result in a loss of about 6-7 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware: Orders Flourish</p>
<p>Recently, the hardware market in Shanghai has been very quiet. Purchases by customer guilds have been limited, and business on the street has been very sluggish. The entire city has been very quiet. However, traders are actively placing orders for futures for the next spring and summer seasons. Orders include over 2,000 boxes of tinplate, priced at 4 gold yuan and 4 jiao (90 pounds) and 4 gold yuan and 8 jiao (100 pounds). 1,120 boxes of iron from the company have been ordered, priced at 7 gold yuan and 6 jiao per box. In addition, over 200 tons of blue lead, over 100 tons of white iron, over 400 tons of English steel plates, and new lead wire, new foreign yuan, angle iron, and bamboo steel bars have been ordered, but prices are still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Unattainable</p>
<p>Overseas silk inventories are quite high, and Japanese silk is still being aggressively dumped. New York spot silk prices are difficult to rise, and real sales in Lyon are stagnant, with prices remaining weak. Although Shanghai European and American firms have been discussing sending telegrams to Chinese silk merchants, the difference between overseas and Shanghai silk prices is still significant, making telegram transfers hopeless. The market is quiet. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased 11 bales of spot factory silk, and printing firms purchased 8 bales of yellow silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>

<p>Promote Childbirth - New</p>
<p>Recently, I saw such a piece of news in the newspapers; (Reuters Berlin: The Hitler government recently issued an order to encourage young men and women to marry, stipulating that married men and women can borrow money from the government to purchase furniture and other items. The plan has now taken effect, and 10,000 people in Berlin have applied to the registry for loans, 5,000 of whom have been approved, 847 have been rejected, and the rest are still under consideration. Unmarried couples can receive up to 600 marks) This shows Germany's attention to the country's population.</p>
<p>There are three types of oppression that our country has suffered from the great powers: political oppression, economic oppression, and population oppression. In recent years, our country has often been oppressed by the great powers, coupled with domestic and foreign troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters. The only thing we rely on is that our country has a population of 400 million. When we fight hand-to-hand with foreign countries, we can resist ten to one. However, the number of people lost due to war and natural disasters is also a huge number! Looking back at the increase in the population of the great powers, it is unexpectedly rapid, but what about us? There is a decrease but no increase. After all, we will complete the three major oppressions of the great powers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I watched the Soviet sex education film (Healthy Women), which is far better than the delicate, erotic, and fleshy film that can only anesthetize people. I know that the physiological changes of women do not need to be kept secret, but need to be studied and guided openly. (A healthy nation is produced by a healthy mother, so if you want to strengthen the race, you must first strengthen the mother's body) This is what this film tells us with pictures and subtitles.</p>
<p>Let's take another look at our quaint motherland! Widows should observe chastity, and nuns should be lonely for life; otherwise, they indulge in licentiousness and absurdity, spreading the seeds of weak races and extinct nations.</p>
<p>A Young Girl's Mood - Wen Bing</p>
<p>The garden is gradually becoming somewhat different from before. From her letters, it can be clearly seen that a young girl's mood is soaring upwards. Before, she didn't write often, and would only send me a simple report when there was something to say. Her words were so solemn, she didn't easily reveal a line of her mood, she didn't easily say a slightly provocative love word, she was so poised and demure, and she treated me with such respect and courtesy that I almost suspected she was a (stone woman). As for me, because I was older than her, my knowledge was naturally higher, and I knew that a young child like that must not be disturbed by my own mood, or by some attitude, so I always put on a teacher-like face, and always told her big words. For example, she asked me about the mood of spring, why it was always flustered and strangely melancholic, and I told her that it was entirely the influence of nature, the reason for the (moving) spring phenomenon; she asked me how she could learn to write articles, and I told her to read more, read more, do more, and think about actual life more often; she told me that her body was very weak and often sick, and I told her to exercise more.</p>
<p>We just went back and forth like this, although we have known each other for more than a year, but in fact, in reality, it is like a superficial friendship. This, I still think is good at the moment, because our circles of life are so narrow, I have unspeakable bitterness, and she is being bound by her family, unable to get the understanding of her brothers, and living in tension and anxiety every day. In this way, if we simply (you come and I go) talk on paper, it will undoubtedly exacerbate each other's troubles, and even bring out some inexplicable pain. I just want to struggle desperately to see how I can get a small paragraph of my own after three or two years. If I am struggling to live at that time, we can share the joys and sorrows and live together. All the previous wounds will be washed away at that time. I have subtly hinted to her about this meaning several times, and she probably understands it, so she often encourages me and my dreams, hoping that some branches can blossom and bear fruit.</p>
<p>However, she has gradually become somewhat different lately. Not long ago, she sent a letter, like an aggrieved letter, full of suspicion and even a hint of blame. It was three pages long, but the meaning was very simple, that is, I should not always put on a teacher-like posture to her. She can be a teacher-like wife, but she cannot really be a teacher's student. She also cited many examples, such as how so-and-so's fiancé addresses so-and-so in his letters, and what kind of words are in the letters. After reading them, her constricted heart seemed to have been nourished. If I had such a letter to give her, how happy she would be!</p>
<p>There are also some letters that mostly say that because she misses me so much, she even spaces out when reading a book or attending class, and often can't sleep at night, and often feels flustered for no reason, wondering if I am like this too. She longs for me to tell her these things without any concealment.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write to tell her that I am sick, and she sends letters one after another, saying that she has unspeakable pain and guilt, because she cannot serve and comfort me, and the letter cannot convey her mood.</p>
<p>Also, she said that her mother is unwilling to bear her tuition fees, and her brothers and sisters-in-law are laughing at her, which makes her unbearable.</p>
<p>Of course, these cannot be said to be completely untrue.</p>
<p>However, I am thinking more: her young girl's mood is soaring upwards, and she not only eagerly needs tenderness in correspondence, but also needs (more than this) sustenance.</p>

<p>Seeking the People - Qu Chen</p>
<p>One evening, after finishing dinner, I sat alone in my study, about to spread out paper and grip my pen, focusing my mind in deep thought, when suddenly it seemed I saw something. It was as if I were standing on a main thoroughfare, looking around blankly, not knowing where to go. Suddenly, I saw a person coming from the east, wearing leather shoes, carrying an umbrella on their shoulder, and walking hurriedly. I stepped forward to ask, "Sir, where are you going in such a hurry?" The person did not have time to answer, and kept wiping the sweat from their forehead. After waiting for them to catch their breath a little, they said, "I am a giant speculative merchant, a skilled salesman, and my livelihood depends entirely on running around. I am also good at using my tongue to persuade people, and some people call me a running dog. Now, because public bonds have stopped trading and gold prices have fallen, my business has suffered, and I am feeling depressed. Recently, I heard that the price of (the people) has soared, and there is a lot of profit to be made in this. However, this item is not entered much, and I am going around looking for it, not hesitating to rush about. If you can accompany me, you will have a lifetime of endless eating, wouldn't that be better than staying at your desk all day for a few yuan of manuscript fees?" I was bored, so I replied, "Okay!"</p>
<p>So, we went west together. On the way, we passed Yangshu Pu and arrived at Caojia Ferry. There was a worker sitting with his machine stopped. We went forward and asked, "What is your esteemed surname, worker?" He replied, "My surname is Min." The man was overjoyed, his face beaming with a smile. He patted the worker on the shoulder and said, "Happiness has come! Why suffer like this! Today, the world is ruled with morality, and common people are valued. The government is newly established, called (the people), production belongs to the public, and labor is supported. If you can follow me, you will have endless happiness!" The worker laughed and said, "Sir, you are thinking too much! Aren't you at the end of your rope? I have two hands, as strong as iron, and I have two feet, as fast as the wind. Happiness is sought by oneself, why wait for it to be given to me, relying on others will end in disaster! Please look at the public figures who are in power now, which one of them is not rich? Which one of them is not sitting high and mighty, and whose sedan chair is not carried by us, the people? But in the political arena, everything depends on deception. Once they ascend the throne, they will kick the sedan chair carriers into the west wind. Empty promises have already filled boxes and cages. Today's failures are none other than yesterday's heroes, what difference is there between them, and what west or east is there! There are only a few tricks, and I dare not go along with them again! Sir, please be wise and turn your sails quickly!" After speaking, he did not answer. The man was dejected, and tugged at my clothes to go further. In a daze, I couldn't tell west from east. I vaguely saw a person lying in the field. I went closer to see, it was an old man. The man was delighted and said, "The consciousness of the worker is ultimately not new, now looking at this old man, he has a lot of spirit, the true people, are they not here?" So he shook him to wake him up. The old man woke up with a start, rubbed his old, blurred eyes, and pointed at the two of us, saying, "Who are you gentlemen? Why have you come to see me?" The man replied, "Old man, what are you waiting for here? The dew and wind are blowing, won't you be harmed! Tilling the fields for others, the worthy men of the past did not do, the new policy of today, the ancient customs can be followed, allocate fields by population, won't that come about!" The old man heard these words, and suddenly became furious. Pointing his finger like a halberd, he said, "You brokers, only know how to make money, running around, and telling lies over and over again. In the revolution the year before last, I lost two sons, and I have a grandson left to sleep with me, old man. The exactions have not been removed, and miscellaneous taxes are continuous! Working hard all year round, I don't have enough food or clothing, crying for hunger and cold, who pities me, who pities me? The rich people and old people, all don't ask. I'm just prolonging my life, waiting for the end of my life. Now that there is a shortage of sedan chair carriers, you are coming again, look at the past mistakes, what else is there to say!" The man traveling with me heard this and quickly said, "No, old man is old, and afraid of war, but please go to the west of the city, and act as an old-fashioned person, no other procedures are required, just shout the slogan three times, not (going through fire and water), but just expressing a little public opinion! When the great project is completed in the future, everyone will have glory, not only will I feel grateful, but also share the peace." The old man said, "You do your dreams, I have awakened from my dream, how many white bones have created how many famous names, ordinary monsters and demons, can't do fresh things, if you want to enjoy peace, you should still manage it yourself. I will see where the hoe rises, and hear the sound like thunder. Please don't disturb my sweet dream, I will wait for dawn." The old man finished speaking, and immediately fell asleep on the field, snoring. Pushing him, he would not wake up, calling him, he would not respond, interviewing twice, I couldn't find a true person. The man's face was dejected, and he seemed to have lost something. Staggering forward, I suddenly saw a broken pear tree by the roadside, and took his two Buddha statues to leave, saying that it was just to fulfill his responsibilities, and it could also be used for emergencies. When shaking hands to say goodbye, I suddenly woke up, and my body was still one step out of the study.</p>
<p>Gentlemen in the City - Yi Qin</p>
<p>"Hey, ticket!" In the third-class carriage of the Route 17 trolleybus from Gaolang Bridge to the Great World, a passenger shouted like this.</p>
<p>The eyes of the people in the same carriage inevitably focused on this passenger.</p>
<p>The passenger was about forty years old, wearing a faded silk robe, a melon-skin hat, and glasses on his nose, looking</p>
<h3>Commercial News Financial News: Abrupt Contraction of American Bank Exchange Rates, Gold Market Opens with Sharp Rise - Recovering Ten Yuan and Five Cents -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market suddenly rose, but the daily fluctuations remained narrow, and transactions were not active. The outlook was even worse. In the morning, the Shanghai Lai Bank market saw British rates rise and American rates fall, with exchange rates contracting sharply across the board. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange fell by 6.4% to 6.5%. London spot gold rose six pence, while American new mine gold remained unchanged at $34.01. Stocks fell by $0.098. American wheat rose by 3.75, and American cotton rose by five "pounds sound." Market sentiment turned firm, and the woolen yarn market opened sharply higher at $12-13, with a rather promising outlook. The rise continued after the opening, but due to bank tightness, the domestic market tended to loosen, resulting in a downstream trend, though with much fluctuation. Later, a Reuters dispatch reported that the American ambassador to the British government had proposed stabilizing the prices of the US dollar and the British pound, which was rumored on Wall Street but has since been denied by local financial circles. Yufeng, Yong, and Guang banks sold forward contracts, leading to a fall. At noon, a speculator named Wu took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and Hongli advanced with considerable and stable force. Later market trading was scarce, and the domestic market was also quiet, resulting in a calm market with little fluctuation. However, after the market closed, there was a downward trend, approaching the ten-yuan mark, due to supply from banks and exchange houses. Operators entered and exited uncertainly, with the "烚赤" price at $1,079. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $713.4, an $11.6 recovery from the previous close. Merchandise opened at $3.3. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at one shilling three and a half pence and US exchange at $33.125. Zhaofeng, Changda, Xingyong, Yuanmao, Yong, and others advanced, rising from $3.1 to $4.7. Meifeng, Zhengjin, and Cyprus March US dollars at $34, Yuanfeng, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Bingxing, Hengxing, and others divested, retreating to $2.5. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote British rates at par and American rates down by half a yuan. Yida, Yongchun, Yuanyong, and others advanced forward contracts. Mitsui bought April US dollars at 3.125, rising to $4. Due to Overseas Chinese and Huabi selling March US dollars at 0.0625, Fuyu, Zhengchang, Hengxing, Zhifeng, and Yong sold down to $2.2. Mitsui bought March US dollars at 1.125, pulling up by one yuan. Hengtai made some purchases. Then, Zhengjin and Overseas Chinese sold March US dollars at 1.125. Hengxing sold forward contracts repeatedly, and the rate retreated to $1.3. Hongli and Yuanmao Yong advanced forward contracts, with the situation remaining relatively stable. Zhaofeng Chang also bought back to over $2. Mitsui took in April US dollars at 3.375, and Huixiang advanced forward contracts, returning to a rise. The noon close was $712.5, with merchandise auctioned at $2.2.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $712.4, with merchandise opening at $2.4. The market opening was flat. Sumitomo sold, while Shanghai bought April US dollars at 3.375.

Zhaofeng Chang, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchang and Xianglian jointly bought forward contracts. Banks traded April US dollars at 3.7, gradually rising to $3. Yuanmao Yong also advanced. Hengyu divested, but Ruixing replenished, and although there was a setback, there was much fluctuation. Gradually, Zhengjin and McCallie sold March US dollars at 0.0625, falling to $2.1. Later, trading was not active, lacking change, and hovering uncertainly. Although merchandise was sold, Yuanheng and Shunli slightly took in. The close was $712.3, with merchandise auctioned at $2. After the close, Daxing Yong, Shunmao, Yuanmao Yong, and Dadecheng made some supply, falling back to within $1. The situation reversed to fatigue. The highest price of the day was $714.7, and the lowest price was $711.3, a difference of only $3.4. As a result, it recovered $10.05 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was reduced by half a yuan by HSBC, to $32.875. The standard gold price was $730, approximately $18 more than the closing price. Therefore, the previous close was about half a yuan lower. The ledger price for this month was $719, January was $713, the morning call money rate was $719, and the afternoon call money rate was $718. The "烚赤" price was $1,079, with the situation uncertain.
