<h3>閩變醞釀經過　陳銘樞奔走閩粤間　徐名鴻等慫恿發動　蔡戴初均表示異議　胡漢民主張未盡同</h3>
<p>▲厦門通信、福建政局轉變醞釀已非一日、溯陳銘樞自歐歸來、即積極進行至最近乃近揭曉之期、其參與政洽之人物、除陳銘樞主粤時者外、類多左傾之青年、如第三黨社會民主黨等是也、當陳自歐歸國之初、曾由港入閩、即係會商特殊行動、結果蔣光鼐贊其議、蔡廷鍇則否、蔡之意旨、以爲在軍事上、十九路軍兵力、不能獨當此艱鉅、在財政上、福建財政、極爲枯竭、十九路軍目前軍頗、餉糈且不能自給有恃於中央月撥六十萬、廣東月恊三十萬、苟一發動、將無以爲食、於是陳復返港、與李濟深恊議粤桂閩合作計畫、幷挽蔣光鼐同赴廣州、與陳濟棠共商聯絡詎陳蔣抵粤、陳濟棠堅不參與、蔣陳（銘樞）拂然而去、蔡知粤不參加、不贊成發動之意益决、並派鄧世增往迎蔣歸、此事乃一時停頓、此本年六月間事也、近三月來、陳復在港迭與其親信籌劃、仍以福建爲變動中心、直至十月六日、陳又秘密來閩、由漳州乘飛機到省、十四日又由省飛漳、然後過厦回港、當時省厦各報、均禁豋其行程、但陳此來、仍無結果、日前蔣光鼐返粤爲子完婚、外間即傳閩局將視蔣此行歸否爲斷、如歸則閩局將有變化、否則蔣亦將主席不幹以蔣固贊成陳之主張也、蔣旣歸粤、陳銘樞之親信徐名鴻張炎繼亦赴港、十九路軍重要人物、乃在港舉行重要會議、徐名鴻等極力慫恿陳銘樞發動、會議結果、决定發動、陳銘樞蔣光鼐乃聯袂歸閩、前第四軍長黄琪翔同來、蔣陳黄以十一月十日晨抵厦、蔡先一日自泉來、偕同入漳、在蔡宅會商、是午蔣陳黄同乘飛機晉省、蔡則以十三日與徐名鴻魏育懷同乘飛機晋省、時林主席方在省、擬向陳疏解打銷故特約與陳會晤、乃陳意志堅决、林乃歸京、至於前淞滬警備司令戴戟、亦以十一日自滬業荷輪抵厦、入漳謁蔡當晚返厦、戴典蔡同一主張陳蔣飛省、蔡獨留漳、即候晤戴、蔡晤戴後、十三日飛省、戴則留厦候後命、至十五日、戴接蔡電、謂事少和緩、尙可爲、請速來、另由總部派機迎戴飛省、蓋蔡抵省與陳蔣晤商後、仍未能决定發動與否、蔡乃促戴往、陳蔣則推黄琪翔赴港迎李濟深來、作最後决定、黄旣到港晤李、旋即先返於十六日過厦、十七日到省、至李氏來閩、傳說頗盛陳等又定二十日開各界大會、將利用民意以發動也、</p>
<p>至於胡漢民與閩事之關係、據十九路軍方面稱、實不及李濟深之重要、緣胡在某種方面、與陳銘樞同一目的政治上之主張、則未盡同且陳部下中之新派人物、亦甚排胡故胡氏殆難來閩、黄琪翔之來、胡木蘭與俱、僅奉父命有所接洽而已、關係方面謂事若發動、宋慶齡或來閩也（十一月十八日）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲形勢之推移　丨德波間之互不侵犯條約丨</h3>
<p>— 寳</p>
<p>歐洲巨大癌腫之一。厥爲德波間之廻廊問題。頃者德國國社黨選舉獲勝。如遵其不顧一切勇往直前之政綱。則非特凡爾賽和約可廢。而德波間之廻郎。立即成爲巨大問題。武力之爭鬭。勢將難於避免。然而德國竟能微轉其顢頇政策。先與波蘭成立諒解。擬訂立一種互不侵犯之恊定。據一般情勢測之。當不致重陷中歐於極度之殭局矣。</p>
<p>夫波蘭自十四世紀初葉以至十八世紀。曾爲東歐强國。當時之華沙。在歐洲繁華城市中。殊不下於今日之巴黎。然經一七七二年。一七九三年。一七九五年。三次爲普奥俄三國所分割。遂失其獨立地位。昔日之繁榮景象。消散殆盡。致令波蘭民族志士。空懷故國。雖曾屢起以熱血抗强敵。終以實力不及而止。迄乎第一次世界告終。波蘭人之獨立運動起。始於一九一七年在巴黎設立國民委員會。當時得法國之援助。聯合國又皆承認其爲正式代表機關。於是波蘭政府。乃在凡爾賽條約掩護之下。宣告成立。加以波蘭人自身之努力。短時期内即成爲東歐强國之一矣。</p>
<p>然波蘭成立之初。即包含兩種矛盾。第一缺乏海上出口。第二無出海之通路。依照威爾遜總統所提倡之十四條原則。民族自决主義。氣燄方張。侷促於中歐之波蘭。又烏從而取得海口與海上之通路。况當時英國首相路得喬治。亦返對割地之舉。則波蘭處境困難。猶爲小事。而法蘭西不能制服德國之勃興。更視爲重大。於是折衝之道。惟有令但澤自德國分離。獨立爲自由市。而另闢廻廊地帶。以作波蘭出海之通路。就當時情形。旣可敷衍民族自决精神。又德顧全新興波蘭之要求。則歐洲局勢。似可相安無事。以進於和平之境域。</p>
<p>不料德國本部與東普魯士分而爲二。乃引起德國人民之反感。不過爲凡爾賽和約所制限。不得已而屈服耳。德國在國防上。幾因波蘭之成立而撤盡藩籬。甚至興登堡總統歸東普魯士故鄕。亦須經過他人國境。於是德人之不平愈甚。愛國主義之飛躍。遍乎全國。希特勒執政之始。即高標廢除凡爾賽和約。而法蘭西又堅持安全保障。換言之即欲以兵力保障自國之安全。以經濟力支持中歐法蘭西與國之要求。吾人進一步以分析歐洲政局。即可知德波廻廊與但澤自由市之設立。波蘭要求。誠爲要因之一。然廻廊地帶。與但澤自由市。論人種則純屬德人。論地理亦難充分說明其必須分割之理。然而其所以卒致分離者。法人與有力焉。此德國不平之所由來也。夫德國豈僅不平而已。一旦實力充分。必將乘機亟起以圖舊壤之恢復。波蘭於此。亦戒備綦嚴。時防爲敵所乘。故中歐諸國如捷克。如猶哥。如羅馬尼亞等。莫不共瞻法國之馬首。堅持凡爾賽和約。以陷德國於孤立之地。今之希特勒振臂一呼。而全國響應者。原因亦即以此。惟希特勒此種動作。就國際外交現勞論。大類日本軍國主義者之盲目猛道。結果恐將不免自陷於困境。蓋德國此時之實力。殊乏敵對法蘭西之可能。在軍事上旣處於包圍之中。經濟亦難覓安全必勝之道。故一般人皆爲德國前途慮。不意希特勒於此。竟能抛棄其硬趕政策。不再與波蘭爲仇。先訂立一互不侵犯條約。結果是否眞能開闢歐洲和平之路。切開德波間當前之癌腫。尙屬疑問。然而此一時期内。德法間不致因德波問題而引起紛爭。至少歐洲政局前途之危機。由此而减低其爆炸之成分。暫安之局。多一法碼。可斷言也。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）美英法意代表將於今日下午集議此間、决定今後對於德國軍備要求、是否仍維持聯合陣線、據聞英意兩國認聯合陣綫已屬不合時宜、但法國則仍堅持原來立場、又聞英意兩國主張一新計劃一方面繼續進行英國軍縮草案、一方面與德國在日内瓦以外重開談判、照此計劃、猶豫時期將縮短爲一年、並將許國置備若干種他國所有之武器、至美國立場猶未確定、美代表韋爾遜已向國務院請訓、今日下午參加會議者、除韋爾遜外、將有主席漢德森·及英外相西門·法外長彭古·與意代春狄蘇拉格　、漢德森曾謂本日之會、乃英外相西門十月十四日在主幹委員會宣言時所代表各國之會議、對於目前局勢、將予以極詳盡之考慮、今昨兩日日内瓦之空氣、頗有神經過後氣象、各國政治家秘密出入於各旅館與使領館之走廊間、今晨彭古曾在蒲里伐奇旅館與西門晤談一時十五分、拒絕發表談片、嗣即徑訪漢德森談話一小時、乃自後門潛出、意代表狄蘇拉格那則於訪漢德森後、逕往見西門、而韋爾遜亦曾訪西門諸人對於談話情形、均緘默不肯表示、因此外間逆料時局苟無重要發展之象、則各國立場之間、定必存有鴻溝、不易化除、此間又有一未徴實消息、謂墨索里尼已授權意代表狄蘇拉格那、苟見各國可以接受邀謂時、即邀其往意大利與德國重開談判、此間消息靈通者亦信即令不與德國重開談判、而意相　索里尼德總理希特勒英相麥唐納與法總理薩勞間、亦將至少有一會議、討論重開談判問題、其地點或者即在意境云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨法外長彭古之宣言、軍縮會議主席漢德森與各國代表之談話、以及各方面未經接洽事獨表示之意見、均謂應維持本年十月十四日（即德國脫離日内瓦之日）軍縮會議全體與法國所贊成之見地、此層甚爲明顯、法國代表之在日内瓦者其所持之態度、不致使其同僚驚異、因法代表對於全體代表團因十月十四日英外相西門勸告而贊成之原則、曾以極明顯之言詞予以贊同其宣言之口氣、固表示同情、即對於内容亦無累議、但本日西門艾登似露出英國政府之態度與本年十月間不同之意、英政府似極欲尋覓新討論基礎、因十月之建議案、渠認爲已無成功之希望、此意西門與艾登雖未明白表示、但由二人對漢德森與彭古所發之問題、可以見之、至於彭古則將今晨對報界　發表之重要宣言、重行叙述一過、彭古似又曾與各代表明白宣言、法國絕不願日内瓦談話改在他處進行、明日漢德森將以開茶會爲名、邀集法英意三國代表·希臘駐法公使波利約斯·及捷克外長貝勒斯再行晤談、如無結果則再度晤談、因此漢德森要求英外相西門及法外長彭古在日内瓦再住數日、傍晚時、彭古曾與國聯會秘書長愛文諾及南斯拉夫代表佛地池會晤、此外一般人相信彭古與波蘭代表會晤時、僅談軍縮問題、並未涉及德波恊定問題云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西南政變聲中貴州王家烈之態度</h3>
<p>以福建陳銘樞爲中心之西南政變醞釀、前星期中傳說甚盛、今雖稍趨緩和、然獨樹一幟之企圖、固未嘗放棄也、前傳陳銘樞自稱五省聯軍司令、列舉有閩·桂·黔·滇·贛·分而言之痧省蔣蔡爲陳舊屬、桂省李白、本具野心自不免與閩省有默契、至江西則全屬僞託、滇黔雖僻處邊陲、然其態度如何、頗堪注意、新聲社記者、昨於訪旅滬黔人之與省政有關係者、得悉黔省與西南之關係及其最近之情態、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>王本傾貴</h3>
<p>貴州省政府主席王家烈、與第三師長猶國才、時相傾軋、曾内戰數次、猶結外援於雲南、故前次黔戰再起龍雲曾派兵助猶、至王家烈則因地理關係、與桂省李德鄰·白健生·等較爲接近、故黔戰中、李宗仁即電龍雲、責其調停、甚謂如調停無效、而滇軍有入黔者、則四集團軍亦將派隊至黔云云、以相脅制、而王猶之戰亦即停止、故以前日之關係言之、王家烈本傾向於廣西也、</p>
<h3>擁護中央</h3>
<p>最近西南藉外交問題而醞釀政變、李宗仁·白崇禧·等、與陳銘樞早相默契、至黔省之王家烈、在一般人之意料、以爲必惟李白之馬首是瞻、詎事實上王素擁護中央、對此種背叛中央獨樹一幟之舉動、不肯附和、復因地勢關係不能與西南（尤其是廣西）立異、故始終不表態度、以免開罪强鄰、</p>
<h3>改造黔政</h3>
<p>然桂系對之、頗爲不悅、據前日所得電訊、謂「第四集團軍顧問張彭年」近日在粤港等處活動、鼓吹西南當局　造貴州政治甚力、現張於上月下旬、由廣州赴南寗、與桂省李（宗仁）白（崇禧）黄（旭初）有所接洽、在邕「留　日、即首途赴滇、向龍雲及猶國才等接洽矣、」由此觀之、桂系對黔王之態度、不滿可見一班、</p>
<h3>電力工潮已有解决希望　華董商定辦法　工方表示接受</h3>

<h3>昨日收染客貨</h3>

<p>敎育消息外埠</p>
<h3>江寗實騐縣敎育突飛猛進　▲義務敎育三年以内定能普及　▲社會敎育確能推行到民間去　▲私塾改進已逐漸與學校同化</h3>
<p>江寗縣自改爲自治實騐縣、縣敎育局改局爲科後、以縣長梅思平勵精圖治、縣敎育科長王國斌之努力、再加以敎育經費之擴充、故江寗縣敎育突飛猛進、非惟改變舊觀、恐本省及外省許多縣份、都望塵莫及、茲將該縣切實推進敎育之實况、摘要探錄於下、</p>
<p>（一）「關於義務敎育方面、」該縣以義敎普及約需經費五十萬元、而全縣各種事業費僅七十萬元、若全靠官家、因限於經費、一時勢難普及、因鼓勵鄕民自動、由各鄕鎭長各就可以籌畫之經費、自行籌費、卽在本鄕鎭成立小學、鄕鎭長興小學校長共組經濟委員會、負籌畫保管、並支配學校經費之責、以地方稅辦地方敎育、鄕民有義務有權利、樂觀厥成、現在江寗縣各鄕鎭已設鄕鎭立之小學有二十二校、（至年終可推廣至三十校）連縣立學校一百十餘校、（本年度縣立小學已推廣許多）再加以棲霞鄕師主辦之義敎實騐區、可推廣二十四校、（江蘇敎廳在棲霞辦義敎實騐區、擬辦二十四校、現已設立十六校、江寗縣將此設在寗屬鄕鎭之二十四校、完全請棲霞鄕師主持、不另再設鄕鎭小學、）以上三項合計、約共一百七十校、江寗自改制后、縮小鄕鎭所占土地面積、鄕鎭加多、全縣共有二百九十五鄕鎭、除如上述一百七十校占一百七十鄕鎭以上外、若每一鄕鎭皆設一校、値須再添設一百二十校、每鄕鎭皆設一校、義務敎育、卽可普及、照本年推廣學校情形、明春再推廣一部、明秋又推行一部、後年各鄕鎭立之校、都可遍設、三年以内、義敎普及、並非徒託空言也、</p>
<p>（二）「關於社會敎育方面」該縣自改局爲科后、將社敎機關撤併、納入學校兼辦、設中心小學十校、實騐小學兩校、此兩種學校、對於社會敎育之設施、比較多些、如燕子磯小學之體育塲、有國術敎師、敎民衆武術、每日到場練武之鄕民有七八十人、堯化門小學、敎員與民衆組織球隊、合作比賽以及馬羣等中心小學、都能利用民衆業餘運動、實施社敎、此外普通小學、每校都没有民衆閱書報處、敎育科對於各校購情書報之欵、有規定經費、而對於民衆治療、除鄕鎭較大之校、由敎學校衛生之敎員、實行爲民衆治療行、普通小學、亦酌備金雞納箱等藥品、救濟民衆衛生、現在全縣小學有農塲者已有一百校、此外各校、亦有公園與體育場爲衆設備者、</p>
<p>（三）「關於改進私塾方面」該縣就各中心小學内分區設塾師講習所、招已合格之塾師、（全縣有三百餘人）入校訓練、現各區有已辦第一次畢業、或正在進行者不等、各塾師非常努力進修、孟不用功、終歸淘汰、學有進益、再幾經相當訓練、卽可作簡易小學敎員、據聞訓練之成績甚佳、現至各鄕鎭、看到私塾、最低限度、其所敎課程、有黨義、國語、算術三門、有許多私塾、亦能用黑板仿照學校辦法敎學、</p>
<p>又該縣爲全縣小學進修計、已於個半月前、成立小學敎員輪流講習所、講習三個月、講演有關鄕村敎育之各種課程、現在第一班係招收曾任小學敎員、或與有同等學力者肄業、（有三十人）畢業后、派赴各校代課、抽調一般現任小學敎員來所講習、補充其所缺乏或現代鄕村敎育必需修習之課程、使其適應潮流、敎學相長、此種講習所、比各種暑期講習會學習期長、且專心致志、似較有功效也、</p>
<p>江寗縣長梅思平、以該縣敎育科設在縣府以外、（江寗縣敎育局改局爲科后、仍在貢院西街舊址辦公、）接洽諸事、間有不便、現已就縣署内騰出一部份房産、將敎育科、於十九日乘星期休沐之暇全部移入　府内辦公、所遺敎育科、（卽敎育局舊址）留作敎育等科之職員寄宿舍云、</p>

<h3>優游三比二擊敗東華　（甲組足球）　東華三大將受傷出場　實力大減遂希望告絕　曁南一比一和華塞斯</h3>
<p>東華昨與優游在逸園作西聯甲組賽、東華大將李寗等相率受傷出塲、最後以八人對十一人作戰、遂被優游所乘、以二對三失敗、</p>
<h3>形鵱槪觀</h3>
<p>兩隊寳力、相差無幾、優游前鋒銳利、東華内部堅强、東華致命傷、在乎三人受傷出場、以八人對十人作戰、否則就當日形勢論、東華勝利之希望、較爲濃厚、中鋒受傷出塲之後、曹秋亭尙獲中一球、待李寗又遭傷、仍可支持二十分鐘、至最後十分鐘、方連失二球、下半場、在人數多寡不均之局面下、造成各一結果、若形勢一變結果亦必不同、</p>
<h3>先發制人</h3>
<p>劇戰開始未久、陳洪光加鞭深入、一球自右轉來、洪光觸動靈機、迎門疾射、唐永純守門上駟之才、一撰倒地、抱在懷中、險象立解、優游銳氣頓盛、李碩友兩次佳妙傳中、接應乏人、良機逝去、吳幼良主踢任意球、離門三十碼、適落門前、中鋒隨脚射去、打中門柱、彈回原地、繼之以頭頂、不料受傷出塲、東華乃以十人作戰、曹秋亭活潑異常、輔以賈幼良之靈巧、一馬闖入陣中、射進一球、</p>
<h3>大將受傷</h3>
<p>中鋒回任、依然作戰、其時馮運佑李寗萬象華曹秋亭表演驚人、全軍聲勢甚盛、票運猝臨、李寗中傷、出場体養、中鋒頭傷未愈、亦退出隊伍、正式在場者僅九人、馮運佑退居内衛、屠開元掌握中樞、陳洪光調歸内部、如是支配、尙能應付大敵、至十五分鐘之久、陳家球忽然底射、陸鍾恩俯身挽救、甚非易事、又五分鐘、東華防衛稍懈、陳家球再度光臨、打成一對一和局、接後孫錦順匹馬單槍、射進門内、上半時二對一、優游占勝、</p>
<h3>希望告絕</h3>
<p>下半場起、東華仍以九人應敵、惟陣線改動、内外兼顧、優游孫錦順陳家球累探龍門、陸氏面面顧到、無暇可擊、鍾勇森如飛蕪駿馬、一瀉千里、又告成功、仍入門中、成三對一、東華以攻爲守、全力對外、幾度猛攻、雖未命中、聲勢尙盛、萬象華巧避敵將、連下數關、轉脚挑中、賈幼良適當其衝、倒地射入、成二對三、希望漸生、忽而曹秋亭又獲傷出場、戰將僅存八人、一線希望、於是告絕、其時雙方前鋒均於猛烈之射擊、幸賴其守門之盡職、得以相安無事、結果三對二、優游得最後勝利、</p>

<h3>又成平手曁南和華塞斯丨一比一丨</h3>
<p>曁南與華塞斯之西聯甲組賽、昨會師於中華棒球塲、上半時精彩非凡、曁南門神徐亨、高截低接、救出險球無算、大受觀衆喝采、更賴徐亞輝之一脚、以一比零佔優、但下半時亞輝傷脚、退任後衛、前線無能爲力、然捨攻取守、難免一失、卒被華塞斯阿巧攻入一球、又成一比一和局而散與上次史高塔杯賽之記錄相等、</p>

<h3>曁南陣綫</h3>
<p>昨日曁南陣線、較以前略異、由徐亞輝任中鋒、中堅由陳鎭祥充任、實最約計、惟華綸亨之前衛、時亦軟弱、出脚稍慢、前鋒左面二人、仍無起色、中衛線甚差、前鋒亞輝太快、餘子甚緩、故有不能合板之勢、加以羅海光於史高塔杯一戰傷脚後、至今未愈、行動不便、吃虧不少、徐亨之守門、不出風頭、大有一夫當關、萬夫莫敵之槪、表演之佳、出於意料、所失一球、出於無奈耳、</p>
<h3>裁判不佳</h3>
<p>裁判員馬許爾在往年比賽中、時有風潮發生、對於其裁判技術、實不敢欽佩、認爲曁南可欺、橫加壓制、此實有失裁判員之熊度、昨日流弊百出、深爲觀衆不滿、幾次罰球、吹毛求痴、後半場丘八發很、行動粗野、不加處罰、曁南亦頑强抵抗、競爭益爲猛烈、而竟視若無睹、雙方均不罰球、此又未免失去其威嚴、</p>
<h3>驚險互見</h3>
<p>華塞斯開球、直搗曁南巢穴、嚴密包圍、出而復進、曁南門前險象不脫、左方受罰任意球、徐亨托出後方、右翼角球妙送、徐亨再度救出、曁南得脫虎口、徐亞輝率師前進、梅洪寳妙傳、徐亞輝雲逢霧均有射門、未能命中、後方又受驚險、派克兩次角球、徐亨化險爲夷、計不得遑、蔡令才帶球殺進、將至罰球區域、丘八見機不妙、背後將蔡撞倒、裁判視若無睹、觀衆大譁、梅洪寳再度進兵、黎却治犯手球、又未罰、曁南於不幸中、失去兩次機會、觀衆對裁判大施咆哮、</p>
<h3>亞輝立功</h3>
<p>半小時後、曁南尹貴義邊疆起義、與黎却治極力掙托、雲逢霧向前接應、衝破兩關、在底線處傳球門前、徐亞輝地位適當、候調正着、見球順勢側射、直飛門角、守門不及反身、挽救無策、曁南乃獲一球、丘八心殊不甘、引兵退殺、茂倫大發牛勁、左衝右突、深入門下、舉脚猛射、球着地向門角急滾、徐亨眼快手快、伏地球出、敵軍雄心不死、再度進兵、包圍球門、大施射擊、均被徐亨高截低接無一得逞</p>
<h3>大意失守</h3>
<p>休息之後、徐亞輝傷脚、退作内衛、羅海光行動愈覺不靈、前線益覺不支、然守多於攻、難免一失、華塞斯旣無後顧之憂、乃以全師開拔前線、圍攻曁南、於是曁南後方、四面楚歌、防不勝防、徐亞輝顧尙勷保駕得法、徐亨迎接有方、敵勢雖盛、無懈可擊、但智者旣慮、必有一失、久而久之、卒被阿巧射中一球、是球由徐顧二人之誤會所致、</p>
<h3>局勢紊亂</h3>
<p>自此以後、競爭形勢、爲之一變、曁南無以求勝、祇望保持和局、卽欲求勝、事實上亦所不能、全軍退守、個對個、糾纏敵人、絲毫不放、右翼梅洪寳全球奔跑、實行抖亂主義、有一時專踢界外球、受裁判之警告、敵軍見計不逞、大施咆哮、行動粗野、裁判不加顧問、任其所爲、形勢愈爲草雜、毫無興趣可言、遂以一比一和局而終</p>
<h3>漢口市運會昨閉幕</h3>
<p>▲六項破上屆紀錄</p>
<p>（漢口十九日）市運會十九日續舉行、多爲决賽、男子三級、撑竿、女五十米、鐵球、鐵餅、標槍、均破上屆紀錄、晚閉幕、再定期給奬、胡炳祺李厚炳有得總分第一希望、</p>

<h3>勢均力敵</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「棋逢敵手，將遇良材，兩方勢均力敵，殺得難解難分。」纔顯得這幕戰爭的重要；也使愛觀熱鬧的人興高采烈。</p>
<p>鬥智吧！諸葛亮遇着司馬懿。鬥力吧！莽張飛遇着勇馬超，愛觀小說的人，看着了這段，總是眉飛色舞，津津樂道。爲甚麽呢？因爲兩方勢均力敵的緣故。</p>
<p>說到足球比賽，東華隊隊逢着了西丘八。籃球比賽，西青年會對中華聯隊。網球比賽，林寳華恰遇邱飛海。包管你人山人海，水洩不通。爲甚麽呢？也是因爲兩方勢均力敵的緣故。</p>
<p>推而至於從前的歐洲大戰，延長了好幾年：死傷了千百萬，直到了兩方筋疲力盡，纔肯停戰議和。這也是因爲勢均力敵的緣故。</p>
<p>看了上面幾個例子，反過來說；最不熱鬧最不値錢的把戲，當然是「一面倒」的戰爭，所謂「强陵弱，衆暴寡，大欺小」，的便是。</p>
<p>好了！據報紙上的記載：「日俄的風雲正急」。又據各國軍事家的觀察：「一九三六年太平洋上的風雲，决不能免。」那是勢均力敵的爭戰，多麽的熱鬧！多麽的有勁！一定超出旣往的成績，還有驚倒後人的記錄，决不像和我們玩玩的「一面倒」的形勢。瞧吧！耐心的瞧吧！這一幕未揭開的熱鬧和有勁的把戲，正在預備開場咧！</p>
<p>不過在這時的我否們，是做旁觀的上客！還是拿來開頭刀，祭大旗？那倒全在我們自己的努力和準備咧！</p>
<h3>看猴戲</h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>鑼鼓喧天地從門外送入我們的耳　，於是我和Ｈ君都給它吸引出去了。</p>
<p>新造平房前面的一塊隙地上，姑娘，孩子，勞功，大少，朝奉，流氓團團地繞立着，當中站着個魁梧奇偉的江湖大漢裏，他赤着膊，手裏拿着鑼和槌，嘴朗朗地唱着一些我不大聽得明白的不成腔調的什麽曲，鑼和鼓是切合這曲的，必在兩句或三句的曲度終了纔來一陣糟響的。他那高聳的顴骨和醬色的臉皮，該負他那不漂亮的面孔大部分的責任；然而，這與他無關，他有的是指揮和控馭别人所不能指揮控馭的猴和狗的一種超凡的本領哪！</p>
<p>我伸長𩓐子往地下瞧去：呵！一頭滿身黑毛的巴兒狗在那兒走圈子，它的頭面終歸是朝着當中指手劃锾孤主人丨江湖大漢的，它的眼睛也閃電似的釘視它的主人，决不因走圈子時方向的變換而有所轉移，那江湖大漢站脚的靠近還豎了兩個一尺直徑大小的竹環蜜接着適成一個亞拉伯數字的８字。主人把鑼槌往下一點，口中念念有詞的說了一些什麽話，它毫不遲疑的往下面的一個竹環鑽過去了；主人說「請坐」它眞個像石獅子般的一屁股坐在地上了；主人說「再走」它却又立起來照舊循環地再走……總之，主人說怎麽，它便怎麽做，這是敎養的如何馴服呵！我不禁暗暗地納罕道：「好狗，好狗！」</p>
<p>但這還不算什麽，最使我們看得出神的，便要算那跳上面的一個竹環了，主人把鑼槌照樣向竹環一點，隨便再往上一指、它不但不肯奉命跳過，反而兩脚抓地，振威狂吠了；主人拿起長鞭子滑稽似的向它打下去，它竟狺狺地撲向主人的脛邊意在實行反噬了，不達機變的我，以爲它眞個拚命地反抗了，後來聽那江湖大漢領悟似的說：「呵！你要錢！」纔恍然這是一套「通同詐財」的滑稽大串演。</p>
<p>名爲猴戲，實際還是巴兒狗做主角，最後，是猴子出場了，主人敎它坐鐵頂，它却很純熟地坐上；主人給牠小竹鞭敎它摹仿挑擔子，它也像小販們似的挑得很好，可是，主人敎它戴皇冠和烏紗，它便不知道開箱子給自已戴上了；主人敎它翻觔斗，它尤其不能，而且使出它的性子來；於是怪蹩扭的主人眞個拿它出氣了，使勁地背着鐵練，拿着長籐條盡量地抽它，把它懸空地揮了幾個大弧圈；然而，它除吱哩地悲啼外，還有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>因此，使我知道比這更大的一切。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>可是看到田青只望了過來，並不離隊伍一步，他很知道紀律是不能因私人破壞的，只是轉了他那一雙黑白分明的眼睛，向田青微笑。田青一面走着路，一面也向他點頭微笑。可是這樣點頭和微笑的期間，那僅僅只有一刹那，黄曼英的笑臉，不曾變第二種顔色，田青已經走過去了。黄曼英呆立了一會，突然拔脚就跑，在街道的一邊，跟了馬伍也就這樣走着。然而趙自强那有功夫去看别人，已看到了他老父的臉上，皺紋是層層的疊起，他手摸了頷下的鬍子，由上而下，却是不停，他手下站定了自己的未婚妻。桂枝他也不笑，也不點頭，更也不轉動他的眼珠，兩隻手揑了一隻衣裳角，只管挪搓着，那兩隻眼圈，更是紅得有些不像平常有如兩個熟透了的紅桃子。他爲了取悅未婚夫起見，已經是把旗人留着表示爲大姑娘的長髮辮，一剪子剪了。這時頭上蓬亂着一頭短頭髮，更形容出他的臉上十分的瘦削，而且十分黄了。直等趙自强走到他們身邊來的時候，他眼珠有些轉動了而且咬了自己的嘴唇皮，在帶了淚容的臉上發出笑容來了。趙自强不便走過去安慰他的老父，更不能安慰這未婚妻了。對於那位岳母呢，只瞥了一眼，好像他繃住了他的臉子。自己對於這一切，都没有法子去安排到的，急忙之中，只好也向他們報之以微笑。自然趙翁是首先點着頭笑了。江氏呢，不能在這個時候，還說姑爺什麽，他滿心裹藏住了奶奶經上的旗開得勝，馬到成功，也就對了姑爺一笑，桂枝呢，因自己的笑，引出了丈夫的笑，自然是不能把笑容來收住。可是在他這一笑的一刹那，趙自强已經隨着隊伍走過去了。（二四四）</p>
<h3>蘇州公園魚菊展覽會瑣記</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>蘇州公園去年開過了魚菊會之後，參觀的人，没一個不稱贊這展覽會的偉大，金魚黄菊，名種珍品，不知其數。可是公園當局，並不以爲滿足，便在今年本月十日起，又舉行一個尤其偉大的魚菊展覽會，先期廣事徴求，四方來參加的魚菊，都是希世珍奇，金魚之中，又有上海一家組織最完備，規模最宏大的魚樂國金魚園，將歷年所搜集的名貴金魚，到公園參加，最爲特色。</p>
<p>這一次的魚菊展覽會，在電影院中，堆起一個菊花山，共有四千餘盆，四面堆滿，頓成了個菊花國，眞是花園錦簇，光彩奪目，蔚成奇觀。東齋却陳列了許多細種名菊，正中最高的一盆主花。是信孚銀行所有。名「天然居」，色黄，東離黄菊，名符其實，菊固以黄色爲最貴重，列爲主花極宜。信孚名花，還有「西子舞」，「虢國夫人」兩種，都是娉婷多姿，賦媚非凡。公園本地，也有「碧草春色」。和「青鬢眉長」兩種，十分幽雅。蘇綸絲廠有「貴妃出浴」，「蘇綸織女」，「翠蓋珠鈿」，「紛霞蓮台」，「翡翠鈴」，「素娥」，「白龍鬚」等，癸酉社有一種「虎鬚」，共有四花，是蘇州絕種多年的名種，藝社出品的接枝菊，一枝上開出「金背大紅。翦春蘿，巧色壯丹，呢金球四色不同的菊花，尤屬罕見的奇品。</p>
<p>西亭是展覽金魚的所在，柴羅蘭，弇主周瘦鵑，有「媚眼兒，紫蘭花雙魚兒」等幾種，五色繽紛，美觀已極。美井巷孫氏，有「金珠，銀珠，紅珠，黑珠」等珍珠魚。潯陽氏的六七年老紫堆肉，紅堆肉，木園的水泡，陳列一堂，最多而好的，自然要推上海魚樂國金魚團特地運蘇展覽的珍貴金魚，共有「五彩絨球，玻璃翠，墨龍，柴羅蘭，青天白日，金星紅腦蓋，三姝媚，金銀絨球，金星鳳尾，鐵面丹心一等等，皆爲魚樂國主辦人謝天寥吳吉人二君，歷數載光陰，苦心經營，方覓否到的珍品。有的是山東濟寗的奇種，有的是北平天津的特産，有的是江南的珍奇，還有是從蘭州覓來的在本地罕見的佳品，陳列在裏面，頓使魚菊會生色不少。四面一望，活潑美麗的金魚，游泳在琉璃缸中，賞心悅目無比，參觀的人，没一個不贊魚樂園的金魚，佳種難得。</p>
<p>上海魚樂國金魚園，園址在海格路，所有的金魚，都是外間不經見的名貴種品，組織完備，規模宏大，營養金魚全用科學方法，可以使金魚耐久不死。而且將來，要派人到買魚樂國金魚的人家，代爲飼養，保可永久生存，不久大陸商塲，要設立一個門市部使顧客便利購買，同時在門市部開幕的時期，就開一個盛大的金魚屛覽，將所有金魚陳列展覽，那時的盛况比了蘇州，必定要增加幾倍吧。</p>

<h3>（母親須知）矯正孩童不良的習慣</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>（噙拇指）有幾個母親寵愛的小孩子，看見伊的嬰孩把拇指伸進嘴去含着吃着的時候，便要這様的說：「看這個小寳貝啊！噙他可愛的拇指，滋味怪好的吧，寳寳眞乖啊！」伊只知道看着有趣，喊着乖巧，却做夢也不會想到這種噙拇指的習慣，足以傷害伊嬰孩的健康啊。</p>
<p>噙拇指使牙床（卽上下顎，）繼續不斷地工作。這種恒久不絕的運動，足以使嬰孩長成一副「長」面孔，很不雅相。而且繼續不絕地摩擦拇指的柔軔的皮膚，足以使新生的牙齒，受了推動而成前傾或歪斜，甚至突出等惡相。有這種習慣的嬰孩，時常把上嘴唇推到鼻孔上去，以致妨碍嬰孩的呼吸。還有一樣最大的危險，就是小小的拇指，却帶進了許多的細菌到嘴裏去。</p>
<p>假使你的娶孩已經有了噙拇的習慣，趕快阻止他，矯正他。嬰孩的嘴，繼續不絕地工作或運動，是不需要的。在嬰孩出牙齒的時候，他拿着咬或噙的東西，樣樣要審愼地檢查過，絕對清潔的，纔可給他，否則爲害不淺。總之，養育你的嬰孩，寵愛和衛生，要同時兼顧的。一味的溺愛，任他噙拇指，咬東西，那不是愛他，却是害他。</p>
<p>嗜糖癖</p>
<p>就大多數的情形而論，小孩子的討糖果或蜜餞來吃，是很普通而合乎正則的，但是，假使這種喜歡吃糖的慾望是被他物所引起的，或是任性爭多的，那麽就不能說合乎正則，且要進入不自然之境。至於嗜糖而成癖，那是有害身體，有碍健康了。</p>
<p>有許多孩童因爲不自然，地養育和進食，以致害成這種違則而異常的嗜糖癖。所謂不自然地養育和進食，就是說他們日常所吃的菜餚，種類不甚平均，不甚健全，無益於衛生，有害於身體。常吃十分自然的食物而長成的孩童，能夠養成一種對於食物常是很合正則地滿意，而對於蜜餞糖果，不致有大而且野的嗜好。若是一個孩童的食品，是錯誤地支配，而去剌戟食慾的，那麽他便要養成一種樣樣東西都要的錯誤要求。一切困難由此而生。</p>
<p>養成這種違則而異常的嗜糖癖，還有一個緣故，那就是在孩童的食品中，缺少了充分的生蔬菜生水菓。每一個小孩子應該從小就吃這種生東西，差不多要是吃了這些東西而長大起來的。每天一種相當分量的生蔬菜生水菓，應視爲必不可缺，「一日不可無此君」的一句話，不妨借來作我們支配食品的座右銘。，葱荳萵，番茄，甜菜根，胡瓜，水芹菜等，對於嗜糖癖都能産生一種解除力，都能帮助長成。一個强壯健全，而血液清潔的孩童。</p>
<p>我知道有一個小孩子的嗜糖癖，是靠蘋果來治好的。醫生關照他的母親說，家裏要常備而多備生蘋果，無論何時，這個孩子要討糖來吃，就給他一隻生蘋果，敎他嚼來吃。不久嗜糖癖解除了，小孩子的健康也就恢復，體重加多，智慧增進。從前，他是一個身體很軟弱，智慧漸退化，愚笨純遲一類的孩子。蘋果清他的血液，矯正了他的違則而異常之廣糖癖，使他的長育入於正軌，成爲一個健全的人。</p>

<h3>對於預防癆病會最要工作的我見（上）</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>月前吳稚暉丁福保諸氏。曾經發起一個肺痛學會。牠的内容怎樣。性質怎樣。我可一些不知。不過僅僅在報紙上。知道他們有這樣的一種事業。其後消息查然。不知究竟怎樣了。頗爲惦念。當時我視了這個名稱。覺得有些感觸。而看到發起諸氏的名單。更不禁發生了疑問。因爲肺病學會。當然是研究癆瘵的一個學術團體。主幹人物。和工作人員。即不是内科肺癆專家。至少對於醫學極有心得的分子。纔能組織。纔能成立。纔能發展。纔能成功。而他們發起人的大部。不是黨國要人。便是名流文士。以爲一定是預防肺癆的一種名詞錯覺。没幾時。報上又發見了吳市長。和滬上財界鉅子。黨國要人。也發起一個預防勞病會。牠的組織怎樣。我可也不很明白。但是顧名思義。明明是一個預防的性質。所以廣羅各界。通力合作。這是很不錯的。因爲肺病學會。是學者的事業。預防癆病會。是社會民衆的事業。根本上。性質上。完全不同。講到學者事業。說他慚愧得很。以我國醫學的落伍。研究事業。一般幼稚。對於肺癆素有心得。而努力推敲的。不敢謂秦無人。但鳳毛麟角。直可武斷。所以研究學術問題。目下不但難以舉措。簡直還談不到。而社會民衆事業的預防癆病。實急不容緩。尤其在生産缺乏。經濟凋敝。智識閉陋的中國現社會。生産缺乏。則物力不足。設備不周。經濟凋敝。則生活維艱。疾病易生。智識閉陋。則黑白難分。昩於趨避。所以在這　情形下的社會民衆。正可說水深人熱中掙扎性命。也不爲過。而吳市長和一班名人。已感覺到這種嚴重形勢。而奮發起這個預防勞病會。眞是何等偉大的事業啊。</p>
<p>這個預防勞病會。當日我却没有參加。不過無論是醫者。是民衆。都應有參加的必要。贊助之義務。這裏我不揣冒昩。先來貢獻幾句。可算野人獻曝。也可算杞人憂天。癆病的蔓延。早已廣及全世界。而一班人類。受牠的荼毒。也已不知犧牲了恒河沙數。可是自從發見癆菌至今。差不多已經四十餘年。醫學家的努力。和醒覺國家的工作。也不算弱。不爲少。而現在還是各地散布。没一個制伏絕滅的好方法。我們可以明白。對付癆病的絕好方法。因爲還未發見。所以不得不阻止牠的蔓延傳染。而阻止傳染的事業。决不是一處一地。和一國一族所能奏効的。現在世界各國。也深感到防止疾病傳染的困難。而推想到非人類合作不可。因此近十年來。國際疾病學會。和國際預防疾病會議組織。爲數極多。對於癆病方面。所以也有國際結核預防會議的一個組織。</p>
<p>國際合作預防。和撲滅疾病。原來是今日解决傳染病的根本問題。但是國際合作。乃國和國之間的團體工作。現在我們自己的一個團體内。還没有整理到預防工作。當然還談不到和人家合作。可是國際聯盟會。倒很關心到我們的衛生事業。而特别優待。另眼相看的派了一位高炎的衛生部長。來替我們計劃工作。在我們醫界方面看。當然是人類合作。人類互助的一種可感舉動。不過其中有無政治上關係。我　不敢妄測高深了。</p>
<h3>敬告全國舊醫青年界</h3>
<p>— 江晦鳴</p>
<p>數年來　饋　舊醫籍，固無所獲：然學以濟世，乃習醫者一貫之期望，吾之懸壺，豈是偶然。（年餘開診於敝鄕皖垣，論業務之發達，可與當地中等醫生作等齊觀，非狂言也，皖垣人士，類能道之，是可安我天命，坐守成名。雖親友中皆如是矚望，然吾旨趣殊不然。診一日病，多一日愁，終朝惶悚，不能自安，非不能愈病也。實乃舊醫中之荒謬學說，怪誕理論，足以使吾疑，足以束吾　智，更足以使吾墮入五里霧中，徬徨而莫由透從？蓋就吾所醫者，什之九吾不知病何　生？病何以死？藥治又何以效？吾雖不敏，吾豈敢靦顔置身於舊醫界中，論病原，蠡病理，分風寒暑濕燥火，辨太陽陽明少陽，自欺欺人，自貽伊戚耶？吾認清事實之敎訓，現代之環境，吾不敢迷蒙蒼生，坐自沉溺，遂毅然决然，脫離舊巢，改習新醫，今之　言非稍受科學之洗禮，即爲新醫所麻醉，妄論是非，　恣意取快也。誠恐我有爲青年，篤學之士，誤入迷途，侮不及贖，與我起同病之哀也。爰竭所見，敬告我舊醫界青年，應依於時代之要求，接受事實之敎訓，幡然醒悟，服膺科學，吾爲前事，其共鑒諸！</p>
<p>（一）認清時代之趨勢</p>
<p>今時代，爲二十世紀之科學時代，科學爲人類探尋幸福之鎖鑰，科學發達之程度，興人類享受幸福之分量，實爲向同一方面發展之兩平行線，歐美列國，以及隣邦日本，科學發展，長足驚人！彼邦人民，蓋已克享物質文明之幸福，證之醫學預防之成績，彰彰明甚。輓近細菌學發明以來，英美及德意志諸邦，天花，霍亂已告絕跡，哈佛大學醫科學生，於實習時，竟無一傷寒病患者，可供診治，足見彼維新之邦，衛生行政，能辦理如是完善，實乃科學之恩惠也，故最近歐美各國之死亡率，直减至千分之十五左右，（如英國之死亡率，爲千分之十二丨十三，日本死亡率，約千分之十五丨十七）反顧我國至今猶淹滯於十九世紀文化殘軌之上，徘徊不前，雖大都市中，了無科學之完備衛生行政，是死亡率之高，約達千分之三十左右，幾與次殖民地之印度相等。人已風馳電掣而邁發，我則追望後塵而莫及，思之思之，能無慚作，雖然，中國政治未入軌道，未始非一原因；但我有爲青年，不啻國家之命脈，豈能縱逝韶光，委身於閉門造車之舊醫中，甘受時代巨輪之轔　乎？居人認清時代之趨勢，萬不容狐疑不决，但從片斷觀察，以爲舊醫之治績，尙有勝過新醫，或本可磨滅者，而委身研究之，敢問縱竭盡平生智力以赴，其奈無科學頭腦何？旣無科學知識，尙思整理舊醫，尙欲舊醫科學化，是已走進　牛角中，豈有出頭之望乎。</p>
<p>（二）認清新舊醫學之學理</p>
<p>舊醫之學理如何，偶檢史籍，即知尙是上古時代及中古時代之玄學産物，絕未進化。舊醫學在前世紀，雖駕諸希臘，小亞細亞，埃及，印度而上，　世界醫之牛耳，厯四千餘年以至今日，則已日暮窮途，不勝滄桑之感。茲舉一例，以證舊醫學落伍之一斑。</p>
<p>我國舊醫學之論病原也。以靈素最早，說亦最備，巢氏病源，但見蕪藝耳，其基礎理論，即五運六氣之說，隂陽也，三因論症也，六經傳梯也，地水火風也，主火，主痰，主清攻，主理脾胃也，主攻瘀血也，三焦也，弊習沈痼，偏執私見，何能溢出靈素之範圍，徒見謬說流傳，空理陳襲，牢守古訓，支蔓日滋，無創見，無發明，上古時代如是，中古時代如是，至二十世紀之科學時代，亦復如是而已矣。</p>
<p>新醫學則不然，在古代文化未開之時，對於疾病之原因，亦但憑經騐及篤信神鬼思想以臆測之，如鬼神作祟也，氣候不良也，　後則逐步邁進，用科學之方法，借助機械之力，循人類學識演進必由之公路，由神學進至玄學，白玄學而淮至科學即就病理學一端而言，如由液體病研學，而血液病理學，而固體病理學，而神經病理學，而細胞病理學，其過程中，疊經遞嬗演變，始蔚爲今日大成，輓近細　學之發明，新醫學之前途，益生光芒！非若舊醫學之陣陳相因，不務實際也。</p>
<p>兩兩相較，則舊醫學之學說，已成歷史上之遺跡，吾人於今日科學昌明之時代，採人之長，追跡於人，猶恐不成，而猶視靈素爲秘寳，敝帚自珍，齗齗研究舊醫學，而不忍放手，是烏乎可？吾非謂舊醫學不當整理也，此不過發古人之潛德幽光，在上古中古近古之醫學史上，爭一地位而已。至謂舊醫古說能發揚光大，即能促進科學醫之進步，赫奕宇宙，獨樹一織，直痴人說夢耳。</p>
<p>（三）認清新舊醫之治療業績</p>
<p>舊醫之治療法中，按，　，鍼，砭，湯液，祝由，……諸法雖備，其發明者，皆爲古聖先賢，今人但知用其成法而已，甚有廢古法而不敢用，而不能用者，如華佗刳腹截腸之術，今日之舊醫界尙有人能行此術乎？是舊醫日見退化，已無疑義！新醫則不然，刳腹截腸之術，古醫不能操作者，今日之新醫能爲之，其手術之精確，亦且勝過華佗妙術，度長絜大，不可以道里計，是新醫進化之明徴，爲舊醫所望塵莫及，望洋興嘆者也。抑又有言者，一二八之戰發生之時，壯烈之士，馳騁疆塲，刀傷槍創，但見新醫救護，未嘗見舊醫一舉手足，如此民族大戰，號稱保護國粹之碩彦，豈忍袖手耶？無亦束手無策耶？其餘外傷治療之業績，亦可見矣。</p>
<p>至謂以上所舉之例，殆不過新醫擅外科之小道耳，舊習之專長，爲内科也，蓋人體四肢百骸，氣化運行，錯綜複雜，至微至妙，豈新醫所能窺見？果如其言乎？曰：不然。新醫需入我國，時不滿六十年，最初服務於社會之新醫，僅少數外人傳敎醫院之醫生，或由少數之看護，調劑員，助手，員役，權充之，以看護等之程度學力，操醫師之術，自難勝任，其診治内症而不僨事者幾希，宜乎舊醫以擅治内科稱譽一時。今日則不然，即以上海爲例，今日上海專治内科之新醫，如雨後春筍，已爲社會所認識矣。舊醫内科所不能治之病，如腦膜炎，新醫能治之，舊醫所不識之病，如回歸熱，新醫能識之，此皆極淺之例也，於此可見新舊醫治療内科技術之一斑。</p>
<p>新醫不但能治病，亦且能防病，民國十六年上海虎疫流行後，衛生當局，即注意預防，今夏尙見霍亂流行乎？其預防之成績，可以想見，故僻處山西甘</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>肅等處，未有新醫之衛生設備，即有鼠疫之流行，由此而舊醫之治療能力，愈顯其貧弱。愈證其太不道步，我有爲青年乎，其憬然以悟？（待續）</p>

<p>問　這種流行性腮腺炎的全經過有幾天？</p>
<p>答　全部經過約七天到十天左右。</p>
<p>問　預後的吉凶怎樣？</p>
<p>答　都是好的。</p>
<p>問　治療的方法怎樣？</p>
<p>答　用消毒漱口水，清洗口腔，每天四五次。局部用消炎止痛膏溫　布。或塗以魚石㴯軟音，碘仿軟音等。或貼水囊和冷濕布等。睪丸部，用提睪帶，或冷罨法，氷囊等。</p>

<h3>腦膜炎槪述</h3>
<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>腦膜炎之定義　腦膜炎者，病在腦膜·腦·爲吾人全身之主宰，腦膜發炎，則全身失其調節，神爲之昏，知覺爲之擾亂，運動亦爲之失序，厥狀若風：且來勢甚驟，昔人不明解剖，僉謂由驚所致，故舊稱驚風，實則風與驚皆無涉也。</p>
<p>腦膜炎乃腦膜發炎之總稱，其固各種化膿菌致病者，曰化膿性腦膜炎；因癆菌致病者曰癆菌性腦膜炎：但最急劇者，係由腦膜炎雙球菌所致，往往菌種流傳，釀成大疫，歷來吾人生命供其犧牲者，不知凡幾，故名之曰流行性腦膜炎，惟醫學家施行病　解剖時，檢視其病窟，不僅限於腦膜，常波及於脊髓之膜，故又稱之爲流行性腦脊髓膜炎。</p>
<p>流行性醫脊髓膜炎，我國古醫籍中罕有記載，恐非中土固有之病。舊醫界汎稱之急，慢驚風，大都爲化膿性腦膜炎，或癆菌性腦膜炎，患者較稀，且决不傳染成疫；而流行性者，獨能釀成疫症，盛行一時，故一般社會俗稱之腦膜炎，槪係指此而言。茲篇所及，亦以流行性腦脊髓膜炎爲限。</p>
<p>腦膜炎之病原體　流行性腦脊髓膜炎之病原體，即腦膜炎雙球菌，係西歷一八八七年醫哲霍赫塞耳拜謨氏（Ｗeichselbaum）所發見。若取病者腦脊髓液，於顯微鏡下，染色檢視，每見雙菌駢立，與淋疾球菌形態類似；其多數占居於膿細胞白血球内，故又有胞内腦膜炎雙球菌之名。</p>
<p>本菌在人烟稠密潮濕不潔之所，生活最適，故　鄕村集居之農舍，兵營。工廠。監獄等處發生爲多。惟其對外之抵抗力薄弱，流行時每以小區域爲限；且患者散見各地，不叢集於一隅。其發病年齡，以十歲下之兒童乳嬰最占多數，年逾四旬者甚稀，至若流行時期，槪在冬春寒冷之候，間亦有於秋季發現，或蔓延日久四時不已者。</p>
<p>腦膜炎傳染之途徑　本病傳染，常由病者鼻腔咽頭之分泌液，含雜病菌，　咳嗽噴嚔時撒蔓體外，直接或間接傳布於人。始則侵入口·鼻·咽喉·扁桃腺·中耳等處；繼則經淋巴道或血道，達蜘蛛膜下腔；然後襲及腦脊髓膜，發生炎症。凡身心過勞，飲酒，感冒，生活不適，頭盖受外傷，或淋巴體質者，最易感發。</p>
<p>常易有體質特異者，經病菌侵襲，寄生繁殖，其自身幷不發病，但能播布菌種，作傳染之媒介，醫學上稱之爲病郵，據醫哲拜魯司（Ｂruns）賀因（Ｈohn）二氏報告，曾檢查流行性腦脊髓膜炎病者之家族三百三十人中，有百六十二人鼻咽腔内染菌而不發病；此等病郵，對於疫症流行，影響頗巨。更有罹病已瘉者，間於病後數週或數月内，仍能繼續排出病菌，亦爲傳染之媒介，</p>
<p>腦膜炎之病理　腦膜炎雙球菌侵及腦膜，即發生炎症，斯時蜘蛛膜與軟腦膜間，滲出纎維素性與膿性之液體。其炎症，始則僅達於大腦基底視神經交叉近部，繼則進展至大腦小腦之穹窿處，而脊髓膜後半側，亦引起同樣之變化，續後更沿血管侵襲大腦脊髓之表雇，波及視神　與聽神經根部，遂至腦實質中發生多數膿瘍，故本病治瘉後，常遺有腦皮質缺損，或慢性腦水腫等症。</p>
<p>此外咽頭扁桃腺爲病菌侵入門戶，常充血腫膿，發生炎症，若腦膜化膿現象，沿神經而進，則湖蝶骨竇·眼·耳各部，往往化膿。倘病毒侵害全身各臟器，更能併發心臟内膜炎，心筋炎，心囊炎，肋膜炎，關節炎，氣管枝炎，肺炎，膀胱腎孟炎等症。（待續）</p>

<h3>天才與勇氣</h3>
<p>— 伯元</p>
<p>偶然起身頗早，却又逢着好晴天。早餐旣竟，辦公時間未到，就學時髦，挾一本洋裝書到公園裏去「讀」。翻開來一看，纔知道抽錯了書了。這是北歐「大名家」的一本作家論集。</p>
<p>然而還是讀下去罷。</p>
<p>不料第一篇第一句就是「驚人之筆」：有天才的人必得也有勇氣。底下五六行，（很像咱們古國所謂古文中的排句），就申說必如何如何乃爲有勇氣，「勇於自信」。自信些什麽呢？自信其想像的途徑與表現的方式。換言之，即題材要找新的，形式也要創造新的；找的時候固然要有耐心，創造的時候也得下苦功，而在找求在創造的中途，更須「勇於自信」。</p>
<p>這位批評大名家就是喬治。布蘭特斯，三十多年前是很有「權威」的。現在看來，他的議論已經不行了：上文所引的幾句，其實並不怎樣出奇。可是我佩服他一點：他這位批評家不搭架于。讀他的書，並不會像讀其他批評家的大作那樣時時感得「惶恐」，彷彿小時候站在先生面前背書。</p>
<p>並且他有許多議論，即在現今似乎也還適用，例如上面所引的幾句。所謂「創作經騐」，原則上不過這幾句而已。</p>
<p>可是我們「文壇」上的作家倒有「斷章取義」地採用了布蘭特斯那一條勸告的。這就是笑納工「勇於自信」，而璧還了「耐心」和「苦功」。也有顚倒採用了布蘭特斯的話的。這就是先有勇氣，後有「天才」。更有合此兩者爲一的。這，大抵是先發表了幾篇作品，然後給自己加上個什麽派的頭銜，「勇於自信」地稱爲這個流派的「頑固的支持者」。</p>
<p>文藝的「國度」裏，本來應該「自由的」。何况據說文豪原來是「商定的」。</p>
<h3>頭髻網</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>「等你賺錢了以後，一定要買給我一隻頭髻網呵！」</p>
<p>以前我每次回家，見到二嬸母，她總要向我這麽說。</p>
<p>「當然，而且我要買隻絲織的。」</p>
<p>「别那麽化費，只要線的就好了，我又不是姑娘丨丨」</p>
<p>「那末現在就可買給你。」</p>
<p>「不，不，等你賺錢以後吧！」</p>
<p>她溫和地拒絕，說她决不願費我一個小錢，在我没有能力賺飯吃的時候。接着，她又原原本本的，說起頭髻網的故事。她說在我大約八歲的時候，有天我的父親上城去，我一定要跟他走，可是他不准。我自然是大哭大閙，從樓上哭到樓下，又在地板上，桌子下，扶梯旁滾着跳着，扭住他不放。他走一步，我也跟一步，哭哭啼啼的居然跟到江邊。父親的脾氣，比我還來得固執，要那樣就那樣做。他聽見我哭，也知道我在後面跟他跑，但他一句話不說的逕自喊渡過去了，在半渡頭也不回一次。受了這冷淡，我尤其難過，簡直在沙灘上滾得滿身全是淤泥。</p>
<p>「那時候你像什麽？」</p>
<p>「記不清。」</p>
<p>「哼，直像條公牛！想想看丨丨」她笑着說，「那時候你才八歲，可是力氣那麽大，我怎麽也擒你不住。我把你從汚泥中拖出，想抱你起來，你却使出全性子把我亂踢亂扭，把我那隻用了幾年，從我娘　帶來的頭髻網也扯得粉碎，使我披頭散髮的回家。你那時的性子眞大丨丨」</p>
<p>「那隻頭髻網很經用嗎？」</p>
<p>「很經用，你將來買還我的，也要那麽經用才好呢。」</p>
<p>她很愉快地笑着，咯咯有聲地，一時拍我的肩膀，一時摸我的頭髮，彷彿我還是一個孩子。</p>
<p>「現在我就買給你一隻吧。」</p>
<p>「不，不，一定要在你賺錢以後。」</p>
<p>「我永遠不會賺錢怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「瞎說，像你這種孩子丨丨」</p>
<p>「人家都說我有窮命。」</p>
<p>「别聽那班鬼的話，我包你有出頭的一天丨」</p>
<p>她說得那麽堅决，那麽肯定，以爲我一定可以成家立業，像我的父親，我的朋友，以及一切與我有關係的人一樣相信我有一個光明的前途。他們的希望，全放在我的身上，在一種渺茫的期待中過着生活。我的顚連，我的孤苦，他們那能知道，這一團忠厚的老太婆，又何從知道呢？</p>
<p>「我實在永遠不會賺錢！」</p>
<p>我每次都想這麽對她說，可是一見她那絕對信任的眼光，我又把話咽下了。</p>
<p>現在我在社會上已經混了很久，除了不斷的憂患，我没有别的希冀。賺錢這種事，以前也曾經夢想，却早已成爲泡影。我離開家鄕已有五年，二嬸母的消息，自然也是渺然。我時常想替她置隻頭髻網，可是她對我的希望，究竟什麽時候才能實現呢？</p>
<p>「等你賺錢了以後，一定要買給我一隻頭髻網呵！」</p>
<p>在無限的悵惘中，我似乎時常聽到這溫柔的，親切的吩咐。</p>
<h3>馬車</h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>嚴寒的夜，寂寞的人行道上，除去三四盞暗淡的燈發着微弱的光外，便祇有一輛空馬車，在行走着。</p>
<p>馬車上坐着趕車的馬佚，他穿着襤褸的棉襖，揚着鞭的那個袖口，已看見黄褐色的破棉花，他嘴裏呼嘯着：</p>
<p>「答！答！答！」</p>
<p>馬蹄踏在寂寞的馬路上，穿過一條石子街，停在一盞紅色的電燈下。</p>
<p>「馬車，馬車坐嗎？先生，到下關！」車伕的嗓子像啞鐘似地。</p>
<p>走路的人，向前走着，步子挨着步子，𩓐子縮在大衣的硬領裏，没有回聲。</p>
<p>「倒霉，怪冷的天，車是空的，肚子也是空的啊！」車伕蹭蹭脚鈴，像對着鈴發氣，也好像從鈴聲得到些安慰。</p>
<p>馬車是成了老社會的遺産了，一天一天地被淘汰着，但在這古老的都城裏，却還有無數除去馬車外不能生活的人，可是他們的生意，是被汽車人力車搶去了。於是在這嚴寒的夜裏，冷清的道上，車伕畏縮着，憤怒着，蹭着脚鈴，揮着馬鞭，饑餓與憂挹噬苦着他的心。</p>
<p>馬車穿過了街心，穿過鬼𪐶𪐶的街心，行人幾乎絕述了，祇偶爾看見一二個買湯圓的担子。馬乏力地拖着脚慢的步伐，在路上響着各冬各冬的回聲。</p>
<p>空肚子的馬拖着空肚子的馬伕和空肚子的馬車，死沉沉地在黑夜的馬路上巡行。</p>

<p>自由談發生了關於「最初的歐羅巴之旗」（一名，「雅片戰爭」。）原作者的考據問題，斷續所刊登的幾篇短文，我都讀過。本來我應當作一個「聲明」或者是「辯白」的：但終以爲這劇本旣爲人所注意，則關於内容價値的檢討，及對我那拙魯的譯文的修正，都是關心者應當指出的。今竟不此之圖，而祇是狂謬無謂的集矢於一個人名，這却是不必要的事。雖然村山原著固在我的案頭，但仍覺得承受「寡聞」之過，並不是怎樣嚴重的。所以，雖看到那些字句，也還是不言語。不久後，孫博先生的說明刊出了，更以爲問題已告結來。</p>
<p>不料十六日某報又載了一篇好駡人而怕挨駡的文章，還是在嚕囌不清。這回確使我很難耐了。爲了事寔，我不能不坦白的有所表示了。對於一般看報的人，雖仍然是無謂的事。</p>
<p>第一，聲明那指「菊生」即我本人，說是要替自己宣傳這些話，是不確的。我否認這於我無傷的誣陷。</p>
<p>第二，菊生君費了很大的力量，給我點了一次名，結果他自己弄巧成拙，這倒最使我憾然。名字，祗是人的「記號」這祇是個人的事。希望好事如菊生君以後不必這樣殷勤關注。</p>
<p>第三，高明君是見過面的熟人，自省那連「淡如水」的交館都談不到的「相識」未有結怨於他之外，而他竟如此氣盛的寫這些文字，我在不解之餘，的確替他感到了無以自譴的傷悼。何必要向無仇者做作笑駡，以博誇自己，反而現顯最後的窘狀呢？如果他是「文人」的話，他應當寫些較有意義的文章。</p>
<p>第四「雅片戰爭」這一劇本，所寫的是帝國主義者踐踏，毒害中華民族的血的史寔。其歷史的意義與價値，絕不低於「怒吼吧，中國！」不過，我的譯文不大通順流暢；希望有人能重譯一次。我願意把我的論本毁版。</p>
<p>第五，有人（絕對不是我，）正從事將這劇本改編爲電影劇本，我希望人能把原著作一檢討，或者是發表關於劇本之各方面的意見。庶不埋没原作者村山的苦心；並且也是身爲中國藝術或戲劇家所應當盡的義務。</p>
<p>我要表白的，祗有這些。屬於正當的主題以外的話。至於「蛻化」云者，又是另一事。生在茫茫的現世裏，存在與消滅，都不過是一瞬之現象而已。有誰人可以决定他的生命及生活行爲，能不「像蟲兒似地」呢？我不能忍受的，是那招話說的，爲了行文而便投來的無端的惡意。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十四）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>他們拉上前桅上的帆，啟工錨，於是船身由由了，在靠近碼頭的平靜的水面，慢慢地向着堤岸溜去。從街上吐出來的微弱的氣息，使人什魔都覺察不到地温從地落在帆上，而珍珠號便像給自己的生命，船的生命鼓舞着，被一種隱藏在它身上的神秘的力推動着。筆爾抓了舵棒，嘴裏銜着雪茄，伸直兩腿擱在前面的凳上，在眩目的陽光下把兩眼微閉着，他瞧着在他身邊過去的，防波堤上那些塗着柏油的大木材。</p>
<p>當他們達到那圍護着他們的北面堤岸的盡端，當他們航人大海時，那更加凉爽的海風，好像一種微寒的愛撫一樣吹在醫生的臉上和手上；吹進了他的胸膛；他把胸膛敞開，深深地吐了一口氣，好像要把它吸進去似的；這凉爽的海風還鼓起那棕色的帆使成爲圓形，使得「珍珠」號的頭部俯下，身子變得更加輕捷。</p>
<p>貞巴突然拉起了三角帆，那三角形的東西孕着風，好像一個翅膀一樣，隨後他兩步跨到後面，又把纏在桅杆上的後桅解開了。</p>
<p>於是這釣魚船便側睡起來，以全速力飛馳着，沸騰着而往後面逝去的水發出一種柔和又激越的音響。</p>
<p>船頭把海水分開，好像一具瘋狂的犂刀一樣，而那被犂起來的波浪，柔和而佈滿着白沫，成爲圓圓的一堆又倒下來，好像那棕色的沉重的被耕的田土倒下來一樣。</p>
<p>每遇着一個波浪，丨丨這些波浪是短而緊接着的，丨丨珍珠號便從三角帆的尖端到舵全身被搖蕩一下，那時舵便在筆爾手裏戰慄着；有時風吹得更强，海水便嗅着船邊，好像要侵占到裡面來似的。一隻利物浦裝煤的汽船。抛了錨在等着漲潮進口；筆爾和帕帕格里從後面繞去兜了一個圈子，隨後又一隻一隻地訪問了停在口外的那些輪船，隨後便稍稍馳得遠一點，以便漸覽海岸。</p>
<p>筆爾心平氣和且狠高興地在有著微波的海面流浪了三小時，他像駕御着一匹快且訓的生着翼的獸一樣，操縱着這木與布做成的東西，祗要他把手抓得緊一點，這東西便會隨着他的意思來往自如。</p>
<p>他夢想着，正像人家在馬上或輪船的甲板上參想着一樣，他想到他的燦爛的前途，他想到憑着自己的才能生活的快樂。他明天便要向他的弟弟通融一千五百佛郎，以三個月爲期。好使自己立刻便能搬進佛郎梭一世大街那所漂亮的房子去開業。</p>
<p>水手突然說：</p>
<p>「筆爾先生，你瞧，起了霧了，我們該回去了。」</p>

<h3>美俄的經濟關係</h3>
<p>— 維祺</p>
<p>在李維諾夫行抵美京與羅斯福總統談判美俄復交的呼聲中，（編者按美俄復交已於前日實現）我想把過去美俄兩國的經濟關係介紹給國人，也不是完全無益的吧！因爲在過去十六年中，美國不承認蘇俄，最主要的原因實爲經濟問題，至於所謂國體的政治問題，乃不過是承認蘇俄後，是否有裨益於美國經濟之一種顧慮罷了。而現在羅斯福總統之所以放棄過去的政策，致函加里寗要求派遺代表談判承認者，也正是因爲自從一九二九年秋以來美國以至全資本主義國家，都全般的陷人恐慌的深淵，無法脫出（雖然經過種種的努力）；特别是美國自厲行復興運動以來，國内工業受投機之剌漲，各工廠大有復蘇之氣象；但實際所製造之貨品，並未直接流入於消費者之手，而依然滯積於倉庫中。九月以降，這種刺激已漸消失其作用，從復回到衰落之途了。於是羅斯福總統爲挽救這種危機以脫出恐慌起見，便不得不急急進行美俄之復交，以獲得廣大的蘇俄市場。故止確的認識美俄過去的經濟關係，不僅可以帮助我們了解當面的美俄復交問題，同時實可以藉此測知最近將來的世界動向。但是不幸得很，關於美俄兩國經濟關係的資料非常缺乏，加以本刊篇幅有限，不能做詳細的理論推斷，所以不備之處，只得請讀者諸君原諒了。</p>
<h3>（一）美俄的債務關係</h3>
<p>此處所說的美俄債務，是指俄國革命前，美國以及美國人借給沙皇政府和克倫斯基政府，而被蘇俄政府於一九一八年二月八日以法令宣佈無效者。這些債務，誰都知道是十六年來美國拒絕承認蘇俄的主要原因之一，（一九二零年八月十日美國務卿柯爾貝聲明美國不能承認蘇俄政府的眞正理由，是蘇俄政府不承認債務和堅持贊助全世界共産革命之擴大宣傳；一九二三年十二月美總統顧立芝在致國會的咨文中，也宣稱美國並不建議與不承認闢際義務神聖的另一政府「發生關係」。該咨文發出後數日，莫斯科政府卽電美國政府，表示蘇俄政府願在互不干涉之原則下與美國談判兩國間現有的一切問題，而國務卿休士則答覆謂没有舉行談判的理由：「假使蘇俄當局凖備恢復被没收的美國公民的財産，或作有效賠償，卽可談判」。然信些債務的總數及其内容是怎樣呢？據一九二五年蘇俄要人暗示希望美國承認，而美國對俄要求的正式聲明如下：（此聲明是正式爲時事雜誌豫備的）</p>
<p>（一）美國政府的要求（見財政總長年報，至一九二五年六月三十日爲止的會計年度四九頁。）</p>
<p>（Ａ）無抵押合同的債務本金總數：一八七，七二九，七五○·○○美金。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）一九二八年七月九日軍用品贏餘的銷售四○六，○八二·○○美金。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）爲Ａ·ＲＡ·（一九一九年二月二十五日的合同）所得到的負債：四，四六五，四六五·○○美金。</p>
<p>總本金：一九二，六○一，二九七·○○美金。</p>
<p>（二）俄國債券爲美國公民所有者（聯邦儲金公民報，一九二二年八月，三九三頁）。</p>
<p>（Ａ）美金二千五百萬圓百分之五又二分之一，五年金庫劵（這是一九一六年十一月發行的；一九二一年十二月一日到期。本利應在美國紐約用金幣交付。半年利息的交付，於一九一九年十二月一日到期，而未曾履行）：二五，○○○，○○○·○○美金。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）美金五千萬元百分之六又二分之一，三年短期債劵，一九一九年七月十日到期（利息應在美國用金幣交付。此種債劵是俄國政府直接的外債）五○，○○○，○○○·○○美金。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）國内百分之五又二分之一，一九一六年盧布券（發行總數達二十億盧布，在美國銷售了多少不很明白。此種債劵是可以在俄國用盧布收回的，因之，該債券在美國的時價，是全靠盧布的滙兌）：七五，○○○，○○○·○○美金。</p>
<p>（三）其他要求</p>
<p>約計：四○○，○○○，○○○·○○美金。</p>
<p>（註）第一項的利息，至一九二四年十月十五日止，總共爲五八，七八二，一二九·七○美金。二三兩項要求總數之下，也須加上利息。</p>
<p>這些債務，據蘇俄政府一九一八年二月八日所公佈的法令中，是說這是用以壓迫工人的，所以不承認；然若美國堅持必須償還時，則蘇俄政府將提出賠償一九一八丨二○年干涉事件中蘇俄所蒙的損失以相抵償。</p>
<p>至於俄國革命後，因美國不承認蘇俄政府的緣故，自然無甚債務關係可言。所有者，也不過是貿易關係中短期的信用放欵罷了。但這些放欵爲數甚微；並且從來也没有延付過。這不僅是蘇俄對未承認牠的美國如此，就對於已有外交關係的其他一切國家，也無不如此。在此賴債成爲世界的流行病，和延付債欵是通常的現象下，蘇俄政府的這種信用，是有特别意義的，至少已成爲美國承認蘇俄的一種信心。</p>
<h3>（二）美俄的貿易關係</h3>
<p>美俄關係，在過去十六年中，有一種矛盾的現象，就是一方面因爲美國不承認蘇俄，和反蘇俄運動，使兩國間的貿易不能迅速發展，但另一方面，却又因爲有這些發展反阻碍了美國承認蘇俄，就是「貿易發展並不藉承認或「純粹的外交關係」。」蘇俄的廣大市場，美國是很明白的；但蘇俄政治之特殊性，使美國感到承認後對貿易是否能夠保其安全之顧慮。第一，因爲「蘇維埃政府壟斷國外貿易，用一種出入口捐照的制度，對於所有貨物的輸入或本國貨物的輸出，擴充了一種嚴厲的監督，和在各國平時通行的貿易方法不同，所以往昔商業的經騐與訓練完全没有價値，而必須廢棄。假使一個外國商號賣與或買於俄國或蘇維埃政府，從他那許多代理商店的一個裏，此種辦理必須按照莫斯科所命令方針進行。例如美國的棉花爲蘇維埃的一個代理商店在紐約買了，從莫斯科交付欵項，裝到半蘇維埃營的船隻，運到一個俄國商港。雖然此種方法有「最高的信用」，集中的負貴，大批買賣的能力和各種的需要與供給這些的利益，可是，因爲此種方法的經營橫過了許多國家的疆界，這外國商號不能隨護他的貨物，不能要求權利，不能調查所運的商品之最後的用途，也不能選擇他的購品，校正出售或裝載，或是於錯誤情形中得到補償的條件。」（一九二五年美政府發言人「否認蘇維埃聲明的正式理由」）第二，因爲蘇俄在外國購買者，除了很少的原料外，主要的都是爲國内生産用的機器。而蘇俄是建設過程中的社會主義國家，故與俄國貿易，實爲間接贊助自己的敵人（反對承認蘇俄的一般批評家的意見）。於是從威爾遜以至胡佛政府，都是採取一貫的政策，旣不與蘇俄政府發生正式的外交關係，但也不禁止兩國之間的貿易和不反對美國商人放欵與蘇俄政府。而美國商人及實業家，因爲没有政府之積極保護，像德國一樣，政府指定的欵以供擔保蘇俄期票之信用，和承受蘇俄定單之抵押（在美國商人技期票向私人公司要求貼現時，通常要打七五折至七折）所以長期的信用賒貨是很少的。一九二九年總電氣公司與蘇俄政府成立一恊定，包含有部分的五年放欵，在宣告時，幾乎是駭人聽聞的一件事。普通在十三月者，也被認爲是長期放欵。雖然如此，但美俄之間的貿易，仍是不斷的向前發展。據代表蘇俄政府在美國的商務中樞機關阿姆托格公司所發表的資料，一九二九丨三○年美國對俄的輸出額將近一億五千萬美金，遠超過對俄輸出的其他各國，占蘇俄的總輸入額百分之二六（近年蘇俄外國貿易的約半額，係由德英美三國爭奪；一九二九丨三○年（曆年）德國的輸出額爲二億三千四百三十一萬金盧布，英國爲七千八百九十萬金盧布，美國爲二億八千三十萬金盧布），另一方面蘇俄對美的輸出也有漸次增大的傾向。茲將一九一三年及一九二三丨二四年以降美俄間的貿易額（一九二七丨二八年以降係蘇俄阿姆托格公司在美國的實賣出額及購入額）列表於下：（單位美金）</p>

<p>美國輸出於蘇俄的商品，主要的是農業用機器，器具類特别是牽引車及其零件，工業用機器類，棉花等。蘇俄輸出於美國的商品，主要的是毛皮，本材，錳，猪棕類，魚類（包含加維亞爾），無烟炭等。現在美俄間的貿易，大部分是在紐約，由阿姆特格公司，仙特羅薩優彝美利堅，士爾哥薩優彝美利　及荷爾拉西安特克斯塔爾新嘉特（主要的是經理棉花）四公司經手。此外也有若干美國公司（如ＳtandardＯilＣ＆·of　ＮewＹork，Ｅitingon-ＳchildＣo”</p>
<p>ＬenaＧoldfieldＣo”ＡlliedＡmericanＣorporation，ＲussianＡmericanＣompressedＧasＣo·等）與蘇俄政府締結特别契約直接貿易。</p>
<p>爲使讀者更加明瞭起見，現在再將一九二九丨三○年（從十月一日至翌年九月三十日的蘇俄會計年度）美俄貿易的詳細内容，及近年來美國輸出蘇俄的機器在全輸出中所占的比率，和與各國之比較到表於下：</p>

<p>日本　一一五　四一　五、二五三　七九三</p>
<p>從上列諸表看來，可見美俄兩國間的貿易，截至一九三○年止都是逐年增加（雖在兩國的總輸出入中尙没有占着重要的地位）；但自一九三一年以降，却又顯著的减少了。據美國海關的統計：一九三一年美國輸出蘇俄的貨物爲一○三，六六九，○○○美金，蘇俄輸出美國的貨物爲一三，二○六，○○○美金，一九三二年美國輸出蘇俄的貨物爲一二，四六六，　四九美金（比一九三○年約跌百分之九十），蘇俄輸出美國的貨物爲九，○九六，八八五美金。退種激落，一方面固然是由於委俄兩國對外貿易一般减退所致（美國一九三二年對外輸出比一九三一年减少十六萬一千七百萬美金，約减百分之三三，輸入减少十三萬二千三百萬美金，實减百分之三七；蘇俄一九三二年對外貿易總額爲十八億三千八百四十萬盧布，比一九三一年的十九億一千六百二十四萬盧布减少七千七百九十四萬四千盧布）；但另一方面實因美國反俄運動和制限對俄輸出，及德國從復奪回蘇俄的定貨（一九三一年蘇俄在德國的定貨比一九三○年增加百分之六二·三）所致。</p>
<p>關於美國反俄運動而直接與兩國貿易有關者，最主要的便是一九三○年以降的反俄傾銷和反對强制勞動運動。在這些運動中，美財長曾經屢次根據一九三○年的關稅法第三○七條留難由蘇俄載來的製紙材料，煤，錳等商品上陸，及制定禁止强制或契約勞動（Ｆorced　orlndentured　laber）的生産品輸入。</p>
<p>美國方面雖然如此，但蘇俄方面仍是没有改變牠的政策。除了貿易外更與美國約五十家製造公司及技術公司締結契約招致美人技師及多數的熟練勞動者。</p>
<p>美俄的經濟關係，在過去十六年中，除了貿易外，投資是很少的。例如Ｈorrimau的錳礦和Ｌena金礦區的讓許，我們只能看做是一個例外。這是因爲投資的資本比不得貿易的資本易於收回；除非得到政府的保護和支持，一般資本家是不願意冒險的。所以美俄復交後，必大有影響於兩國經濟無疑。</p>
<h3>（三）美俄復交後對於美俄及世界經濟的展望</h3>
<p>據連日華盛頓的電報觀察，羅斯福與李維諾夫談判，倘若没有意外問題發生·美國承認莫斯科政府是不成問題的了。但美俄復交後，對於美俄兩國以及世界經濟究有怎樣的影響呢？關於這一點，因爲篇幅關係不能作理論的展開，故只能作一個很槪括的原則的論述。</p>
<p>第一，美國承認蘇俄政府及成立商約後，兩國間的貿易將必隨之而增大。這在蘇俄方面必更能使第二次五年計劃圓滑進行。因爲蘇俄年來人超極大，及前此在外國賒購貨物的借欵也將次第到期（一九三三年將償還德國債權人七○○、○○○、○○○至八○○、○○○、○○○馬克），故輸出增大和獲得新的賒貨，不僅對於國家財政上有莫大的補助，同時也能够調節國内的經濟。然在美國方面又是怎樣呢？輸出增大或許能使國内的工商業活潑起來（特别是重工業及農業中的棉花部門），减少失業，而某程度的帮助羅斯福的復興計劃；但這不過是一時的强心針。因爲自從恐慌以來，美國的辦貨數量是很大的，工廠倒閉失業衆多也爲空前所未有；故絕不能因爲獲得有組織有計劃的蘇俄市場，就能把垂死的資本主義復蘇過來。至於藉承認以圖大量的向蘇俄投資活動其死藏的資本。這只是一種希望。固然大量的向蘇俄投資，蘇俄政府是不拒絕的；但必須在牠的法律及監督下舉行。因此，一般資本主義國家和資本家·都認爲向蘇俄投責，是自己方面利益少，蘇俄方面利益大，而畏縮不前。這只要看曾與蘇俄發生正式外交關係的資本主義國家向蘇俄投資之不踴躍，便可知道。美國旣是資本主義國家，自然也不能例外。</p>
<p>第二，美國承認蘇俄後對世界經濟將有怎樣的影響？一般人對於這個問題都抱有絕大的希望，以爲　國承認蘇俄可以使衰落的世界經濟復興起來。我以爲這是皮相的觀察，爲什麽呢？因爲現時的世界恐慌之原因不是由於美國不獲得蘇俄的市場，而是由於資本主義内在的腐敗。不錯，美俄兩國都是世界經濟的一員，美俄兩國經濟的活潑發展對於世界經濟是有影響的；但這種影響是很徴的，並且我們上面已經論證過，美國並不能因承認蘇俄而就能够恨復繁榮。所以希望由美國承認蘇俄而復興世界經濟·實是一種夢想。二二、一一、一五、</p>
<h3>今年之上海銀行業</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>上海爲全國金融之中心，銀行爲金融之樞紐，劑盈補處，宏濟萬端，其經營之得策與否，影響於國計民生者至鉅。處茲經濟衰落，民窮財盡之秋，我人欲探討國民經濟之眞相，要可就銀行營業以觀之，故今年過去數月中，該業之狀况，吾人似有加以觀察之價値焉。</p>
<p>過去十個月中，上海銀行業，雖承去年滬戰殘局，而表圍上似深形活躍，計先後新創者有華安，大滬，五華，至中，惠中等十餘家，現正籌備行將開業者，爲數益夥。宣告清算者，則僅民信銀行及華通銀行二家，驟視之，似頗呈蓬勃氣象，然若細加檢討，則病態似仍不能免耳。</p>
<p>（一）游資充朱　自去歲滬戰告終，内地現金爲謀安全計，集中上海之現象，益形顯露，截止今年七月底止，計全市共存現洋二七五，四八○，○○○元，現銀一四○，七九二，○○○兩，較去年年底，計增加百分之十，較二十年十二月底，增加一倍餘，各銀行以政局不寗，工商凋疲，均不敢投資於實業，以助長其發展，坐擁鉅資，虛耗利息，深感無法消納之苦。因而一部份行家，利用之套賣政府公債，以博取相當利潤，上焉者則有投資農村，以潤澤農民經濟之籌議，惟是農區遼闊，農民散漫，欲培養其利用銀行資金之能力，非先加訓導而促進合作社之組織不可。顧厥事艱鉅，豈崇朝所能立致哉。</p>
<p>（二）新行勃興　今年新創之銀行，計自一月份至十月底止，先後開幕者，共達十五六家，市况日下，而同業突多，事之反常，疇逾此者，推演所及，義爭立現，衰落將至，嘗考各企業家籌設銀行之動機，志在扶助實業，發展國民經濟者固居多數，而擬利用存戶存欵，作投機之買賣者，爲數恐亦不少，向之致力於錢莊業務之思想，較爲敏者，亦皆斥資創設銀行，以留他日錢莊海汰後之地步，此其迎合潮流，鼎新革故之精神，固足多者，顧以思想較舊之人，處理富有學理之事業，畫虎不成反類狗馬，頌不忘規，或非過慮歎？</p>
<p>（三）趨向投機　銀行得存戶之信任，代爲保管存欵，以一部份運用於有價證券，或不動産之買賣，固屬正當業務，若舉大部欵項，作爲投機之捷徑，則未免貽畸形發展之譏。今年各銀行因時局多故，投資途徑日趨隘狹，濟困有願，問津無門，末流所至，大都放棄其固有之營業，趨向於投機之一途。牟利有餘，穩健不足，一旦變起倉猝，市價慘落，則遭受損失者，寗限於少數股東已也。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，銀行界所負使命之重大，旣如彼，而業務之變態又如此，萬一偶露破綻，則不蹈信交風潮之覆轍，疇能斷言。我人緬懷已往，警惕來茲，不禁悚然。雖然迷途未遠，來者可追，我金融界忝居經濟界重要之地位，盍作補過於無形綢繆於未雨之計歟？歐美各國近年來銀行合併之事，比比皆是，集中力量，提高效能，收益之大，不容忽視。然則爲今之計，我國近年來新創之銀行資本微薄者，允宜逐漸合併，團結精神，提携邁進，是亦補救此當前危機之道乎。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論大學生綁票</h3>
<p>— 邨人</p>
<p>學生在五四運動　時候，有人稱爲「丘九」，以　　當時　　賣匯賑的兇很有如丘八的士戰塲，但又幷不是丘八，故以「丘九」稱之。學生　影允　當敎育部長的時候，又被稱爲「學匪」，大人先生們以其鼓動學潮的厲害有如土匪的騷擾地方，但又幷不是土匪，故以「學匪」稱之。「丘九」與「學匪」都是對於學生的誣蔑不敬之辭，在後者「學匪」一辭的發生適逢魯迅先生他們當時和彭允彝鬥爭的時候　更爲魯迅先生他們藉口作爲武器，一方面替學生辯護，一方面攻擊彭允彝。</p>
<p>誰料得到今日竟有眞的「學匪」，　大學生作綁票匪！</p>
<p>又誰料得到，這作綁票匪的大學生，也竟至於是在北京（現在呌北平）出現！</p>
<p>但大學生作綁票幷不綁富貴宦的票，却綁了自已學校裏頭的同學。其原因自然是那同學屬於富商貴宦的子弟，同樣是活財神。然而，同學綁同學却也給人茶餘酒後以一種談助。這或者是從小學時代捉迷藏的游戲中的智識來的肥？捉迷藏的游戲是用手巾束住同學的眼睛呌他去在黑暗裏摸索，綁票也就這樣地將同學綑起來，放在呌他不能自由的黑暗地方任他去思索那是被綁到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>大學生綁票，憂時之士喟然而嘆曰：敎育破産。</p>
<p>其實中國現在的敎育，其目的就是在製造一批一批畢業生到社會來失業，失業而作綁票匪者不算希奇；因此可以說是其目的就是在製造綁票匪也有幾分理由。那末，照以上的我底邏輯看來，大學生綁票，中國現在的敎育，目的達到，幷不破産。</p>
<p>不過話雖然可以那樣說，還得說回來。大學生而至於作了綁票匪，這和敎育没有什麽關係，那是國民經濟的破産，社會制度的不良，貧者益貧，富者益富，使窮人挺而走險以求生存的尖端表現。我們以這一次北平的案件來說，那幾個作了綁票匪的大學生，如果經濟不受壓迫，定能安心讀他的書做他畢業後的美麗之夢，决不至於甘願犯法而作匪盜行爲。</p>
<p>或者有人說，經濟受壓迫的大學生幷不只他們那幾個人，爲什麽别人不去作綁票匪，他們却那樣的去幹，這也是一個價得研究的問題。</p>
<p>這問題的中心點在於他們旣然挺而走險，那就無論走那一條路都是一樣的爲了經濟壓迫而求生存。同樣受經濟壓迫的人，有的不敢和社會反抗而忍受着痛苦，有的却否認了社會制度下的一切而鬥爭，這就是古語說的一句話：弱者塡於溝壑，强者挺而走險，區别在强弱之分。</p>
<p>然而，在這動亂的時代中，挺而走險的人幷不少，也不一定凡是挺而走險的人只有走向作綁票匪，這一條路，那幾個大學生應該受人斥責者在此而不在彼。</p>
<p>又應附帶說明，作漢奸，當土匪，等等的挺而走險的路和作綁票匪的路是一樣。</p>
<h3>「小馬殉主」</h3>
<p>— 野馬</p>
<p>當我第一次看着歐美運到我國來的關於野獸的影片的時候，我簡直不相信那是些眞有的事。往來漸漸的聽人說，那些兇猛的野獸是經過人的訓練而後才能合起羣來聽從人的指揮做戲的。這次海京伯馬戲班到上海來，據看過的朋友回來說該班蓄有大批兇猛的獅虎和黑熊，個個都會做戲。我聽了就老早下了决心要去看一看，後來因爲幾次都没有買着票，至今還没有去看成，心裏好像空空地缺少一件什麽東西似的。</p>
<p>前天本報載着一條關於該馬戲班的新聞，大意：該班克來白君患糖尿病卒於醫院，　　　之　　　　　無日　　其主歸來，卒至　食不　死於獸醫院中。</p>
<p>這種動物殉主的故事，在好些俠義的舊小說裏讀得很多了，但從來没聽說過眞有這類的事實。這次報載的事情，大槪總可以眞的證實了，因之連帶的我觸起了好些感想。</p>
<p>這在一些老成的先生們知道了，必定要幌着腦袋子覺着「世人不如野獸」了。然這觀點，我覺得仍然是不相干而且是不通的說敎。我爲這事印在心上而留着揩不去的痕跡，倒不是以爲這一「小馬」能絕食殉主之可風，因爲以此鼓勵世人，無異想都把世人奴化成許許多多没有出息的可憐蟲（實在連可鄙的個人英雄都談不到！）對於這件事我們應當在「何以小　　以身殉」的　點上去研究，在這一「小馬」和其主人關，必爲聯繫着有一種什麽「力」，這個「力」便能促使這「小馬」去以身殉它的主人。像這樣的一研究，那麽，我們就會發現了天地間唯一的能創造一切的「仁愛」和「同情」來！這「仁愛」和「同情」的「力」是偉大到不可思議的。假使「小馬」和其主人之間没有這個「力」的存在，至少，我們可以說「殉」的事是不會必然有的：假使果然竟有的話，那個「死」，我們也必然的承認是偶然的，巧合的，兩者之間根本就談不到什麽關係。再進而講到獅虎黑熊之類的野獸，也是一樣的。牠們生性是兇猛的殘暴的東西，普通人碰着他們，那是很少有再生的希望的，然而，事實上牠們究竟受了特殊的一種人的訓練，居然打夥兒合起做出戲來，這絕對不是偶然的幸運事，更不是像神怪的舊小說裏所說的這些人是「玉皇大帝」派遣來馴服獅虎的，或是。所謂什麽「服虎星」之類不可理解的怪話所能解釋得通的；他們也是普通的人，他們的拳頭，一樣的與普通人不能敵過兇猛的獅虎的鐵爪利牙，一樣的有給牠們慘殺或吞食掉的危險的可能！但他們終於馴服了兇猛的獅虎來受他們的訓練，聽他們的指揮而給他們做戲。這就是說：在牠們和他們之間，有一種偉大到不可思議的，能夠創造一切的「力」的存在着！這「力」，便是「同情」和「仁愛」。它不但做了馴服牠們的原動力，並且也是使牠們間互相合作友好的一種主要的因素。在該馬戲班班主在學藝社公開的演說的證實，便知這裏所說的是不謬了。</p>
<p>在這兒我們便得了一個極大有力的敎訓：現代固然是一個殘酷的弱肉强食的强盜世界，一切都是不分青紅皂白的。可是，假使要想眞正的征服某一種東西，或是要統治某一個民族，僅憑藉他的武力是不夠的，而且結果必然是失敗的，空虛的。我們看吧：畜牧的民族，當他們畜牧他們的弱小的牲畜的時候，他們總是拿鞭笞和威嚇來制服牠們，牠們雖然没有反抗的能力，（其實也不盡然的），但一旦牠們有機會，牠們是會　　逃走的。牠們爲什麽要逃走呢？他們也是牠們的「主人」，何以他們便得不到牠們「以身殉主」的事情的表現呢？假使他們畜牧的是獅虎黑熊之類，牠們亦同樣會受制服於他們的鞭笞和威嚇之下嗎？……所以，我們　道：在無論什麽情形之下，幹無論什麽事，在不可憑藉的武力的蠻幹之外，是需要着廣大的存在於無形中的力量偉大到不可思議的「同情」和「仁愛」！</p>
<h3>眞廬隨筆</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>無意中，在一本書裏，看見有這樣幾句話：「日本人，何論做什麽事，都是神聖地，嚴重地，正經地，緊張地做去。中國人，任何動作及行爲，多是兒戲地，輕浮地，浪漫地，弛懈地做去的。」唉！在這簡單的幾句話裏，就象徴出一個是：開疆拓土，有作有爲的，强的民族。一個是：喪師失地，萎蘼不振的，弱的民族！所以，東四省的失，也不能說是「不抵抗將軍」一人的罪哩！</p>
<p>中國人虛僞了一生，活的時候，名片上印了一大串的頭銜，死了，訃聞上，也連珠般的，刊了不少的經歷。</p>
<p>男的十人中，倒有九人，在訂婚前，第一個條件，是刺探女的，面貌標緻。女的十人中，也有九人，訂婚前，第一個件件，是打聽男的，家産富有不富有：學識，性情，品形，都在其次，所以結合了以後，女的色衰了，男的就要遺棄。男的金盡了，女的就要離異。「太太死仔軋勿開，老爺死仔嘸人來。」看了新近上海某白相人，妻子大出喪的熱鬧；與香港陳恫的身後冷落，對於這兩句俗語，更得了一個有力的認識。</p>
<p>「財香趕人八隻脚，人趕財香追勿着。」每個人心中，時常記了這兩句俗語，「航空奬券」等等的，橫財生涯，可以一落千丈。</p>
<p>自從前年「九一八」起，日寇佔了我們東三省，又來攫取我們熱河，不旋踵，又在窺圖華北，牠的野心很大，牠的慾望很奢，正合了中國一句諺語：「日進無疆！」</p>
<p>無智識的牧童姑村的愛情，倒是眞望的，　　　　的愛情，　　　　的。</p>
<p>中國人說：日本人，　於　防，　少創造，賽過像　　猴子。但，日本人也在說：支那人，不要說没有創造，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>直連模仿也不會，但會享現成！好比一隻貪吃懶做的睡猪！唉！那麽同胞們，還要夜郎自大嗎？</p>
<p>要刺探學校裏的新聞事情，可向校厠裏的牆壁上招，得了。要知道公館裏的艶聞秘事，只要留心老虎灶旁，娘姨們的談話，便得了。</p>
<p>兩位拿航空奬券，五十萬元，做題目，做文章的人，我猜測他自己，一定也買着奬劵，在做五十萬的黄金夢的，不然，决不會無故發牢騷。</p>
<p>「一日不食則飢，三日不食則病，七日不食則死！」自從聖雄甘地，發明絕食四十天的偉大新貢獻後，這幾句話，根本打破了。</p>

<p>一　×先生之死</p>
<p>我的老師×先生之死，使我有了回鄕的機會。於時故鄕和我已有半年以上的别離了。回鄕於我自然是一件愛悅的事，然而這次的愛悅却完全給傷逝的棖觸所替代了。</p>
<p>在晨光熹微中，我從輪船埠頭跑到×先生的寓所，×先生已是直挺挺地放在中堂，冷酷的寂靜充滿着這個熱情的人的周圍，我禁不住悲慟了。</p>
<p>他是個個性堅强的人，這在他的死更表現得非常的明顯，他是的確以身殉了他的個性。</p>
<p>他病的起源已是一年以前的事，當時經幾個他的當西醫的朋友的診察，都認爲是初期的Ｔubeculosis，可是他，他自信也頗有醫學常識的，認爲他决不致於生肺病的，他靠了「騐方新編」的指示，認爲他的病完全是由於「内邪固結，肝火甚旺，」只要「透邪去火」，便可以「百病消散」了，因此他請了大名鼎鼎的「國醫」某先生來看，某先生把三指一按，也斷定是决非肺癆病，而是「虛濕内困」，他於是拍手稱是，同時却把那當西醫的朋友痛駡了一頓。</p>
<p>雖然他的精神因服了某「國醫」的「國藥」略恢復了些，可是他的病却在加速率地激進，爲的是他對於酒又有特别的愛好。</p>
<p>幾個當西醫的朋友時時警戒他，幾個稍有科學常識的朋友也時時規勸他，他的回答只是這樣的話：</p>
<p>「你們都是吃外國屁的，閉口肺病，開口Ｔ·Ｂ·快去多讀些内經騐方新編吧，别再胡閙瞎說了你看我的病一天天的好起來了，要是早給你們西醫診治的話，不嚇死也要麻煩死了！」</p>
<p>然而根據某西醫給他用愛克司光所照的照相，以及把他的痰檢騐的結果，Ｔuberculosis確實很激進地在他的身上進展着。</p>
<p>朋友們儘替他發愁，某「國醫」儘替他「補内表外」「去濕平肝，」他儘歌頌着「國醫」的高明，時光就這樣的溜過去了，一直到他死。</p>
<p>他病得最厲害的幾天，某「國醫」這才着了忙，竟也帶了一隻「聽筒」來替他細「聽」，並且也拿了痰在顯微鏡下「張」了一回，搖了搖頭道：「竟確是Ｔ·Ｂ·Ｃ·没法了！」終於在脈案上寫了「…人力已盡，且求天佑」的玄之又玄的斷語走了</p>
<p>×先生就是這樣的以身殉了他的主張了。</p>
<p>我在××先生尸身的周遭鍍着踱着，我悲哀極了，同時，我又憤怒極了。</p>
<h3>焚布療疾</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>十四日本刊立齋君的談言國術批判中有「蕭老師的焚布療疾」句，恐怕没有六十三代張天師扛着命牌寳劍到大世界替人畫符消災」來得普遍性。作者在一星期之前曾偕了鄕下的親戚去瞻仰過一番，不過没有寫一篇「蕭老師訪問記」，似乎是遺憾，現本「上帝有好生之德」，寫下來「超渡衆生」，希望馬路上爛了大腿不能跑路的乞丐，以及瞎了眼只能學算命先生的宣子，都歸蕭老師焚布一療，則同胞幸甚，中國幸甚！作者在這裏謝謝立齋先生的提醒我。</p>
<p>我的親戚告訴我在一張小報上瞧見了什麽精神哲學××會的療疾廣告，可以不費分文醫治各種疑難雜症，雖然底下還有像燒香還願般的自欺欺人的「誠心則靈一的術語，但是我的親戚正是個「誠心則靈」的崇拜者，他生了十多年的病，一切算命問卜燒香還願，甚於三跪九叩，什麽「心」都「誠」過；然而始終是不見「靈」，所以被他又發見了一種焚布療疾的新「醫術」，就不遠千里的「誠心」趕到上海來嘗薈這一焚的味道。</p>
<p>我陪了他按着那張小報上的地址驅車前去，是一所雙開間的大住宅，穿過天井，一座很大的客廳，按照市面上的房租計算起來，蕭老師大槪事幾萬家當到上海救濟病人的。那時我想起我的朋友眞不幸，在這位老師没有到上海之前害了一場很重的病，一切醫藥費的擔負使他至今還没有償清。不然，化一元幾毛錢買二丈布，焚這末一焚，吞這末一吞，早已手輕脚健，無病一身輕了。</p>
<p>掛號處分二面，一男一女。許多「誠心則靈」的「善男信女」靜靜的坐着，等候他們丨男的大槪是蕭老師了，女的不知是否老師夫人，雙手捧着一張道士「踏表」用的，也就是「蛇明五寳印鎭宅」等類的黄紙，在一個居中的大香爐上或者是畫符念咒，那位誠心的朋友，緊閉雙目，坐在醫者的對面，於是醫頭者那張黄紙在香烟繚繞中揮幾個圈子之後，向病者的頭上照樣動作。醫腿，醫什麽等，以此類推。</p>
<p>我的親戚是十數年的老胃病，不能多吃，一吃就脹，不能少吃，少吃就餓。當然，我們的老師命我親戚閉緊雙目之後，那張黄紙是在他腹前揮圈子了。這種精神治療的方法確也輕便，不知像牛惠霖般大醫生知道上海有不費分文的老師在搶他飯碗頭他是否要求醫師公會開會謀締止之方？</p>
<p>精神治療完畢，他授給我親戚兩疊黄紙，一疊臨睡前用白開水吞下，一疊睡時束在腹前（因爲是醫胃病）。並且說這是老病丨這就能顯出老師的神術了，他知道我親戚的胃病是老病丨你從鄕下遠遠的跑來，多帶一點藥歸去，明天買二丈布，焚灰之後·每天吞服就行了，老師是這樣體諒病人的。</p>
<p>在右邊角上，放着一個大鐵鍋，一位或者是小師吧？正把撕成一方塊一方塊的小布用鉗子鉗了放在火上焚燒，化下來的灰就是萬應的靈丹。有一位失明了三年的老婦人，也在那裏醫治，我祝福她能遇見這樣一位神術高明的老師她可以張開眼來瞧瞧上海在三年之内倒底變了多少花樣，至少逛逛大世界看看狸貓換太子也不枉活了一把年紀。</p>
<p>這一段訪問記字數並不怎樣多，在我自己己是竭力誇大的宣傳了：還幸老師的精神治療是不取分文的，否則我好像有些嫌疑不知受了老師多少費用，所以我特别聲明，我和老師僅僅是見面一次，話都没有講一句，皇天在上，如有半句虛言，被雷打死。</p>
<p>不過我的親戚帶了這末許多的「靈丹」歸去，至今没有一封老病稍愈的信來，難道他不遠百里從鄕間來還不「誠心」嗎？我想他是個「誠心則靈」的崇拜者總不會有這末的失着。</p>

<h3>姐姐要出嫁了</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>今天裁縫來了，把將做新嫁娘的姐姐的新衣服都五件一紥，五件一紥的用紅絨繩紥起來放在新箱子裏了。跑到樓上臥室裏，看見舊日姐姐放衣服的衣櫉箱子，都半開半遮的散亂地擺着：樓下面的東西也是什亂地放着，是呀，姐姐要出嫁了。媽媽老人家時常淌着淚爲着姐姐的出嫁，可是姐姐呢，倒是嘴角邊掛着收不了的笑渦，由她這表情，可以看出他心中的愉快了，啊！姐姐出嫁了，在她的歡愉中，我們都感到一些離别的傷感。當一個靜寂的晚上，清脆的凄慘的在冷街冷弄喊着。「檀香橄欖賣橄攬喲………」的聲調反射到我們底耳鼓裏來時，媽媽總在暗淡的燈光下，眼角裏掛着晶瑩欲滴的淚，她感傷地說：二十餘年來相處的母女姊妹，一旦就要分離了。」</p>
<p>姐姐的婚姻是在父母之命，媒妁之言所撮合的。男方的要求說要不用花轎，舉行「新式結婚」的儀式，媽媽固執着不依，說是「孩子一生只這一回，要圖光榮和吉利，花轎定要坐的：新的儀式太兒戲，戚友們要笑話的。」她又說：「其實依照最近的情形看來，這所謂的「新式結婚」，拜除了把「升」的瞌頭，換了三鞠躬，和所謂「新郎袍套」換了西式的禮服禮帽，新娘的鳳冠霞珮換了長拖地一丈有餘的輕紗外，其餘還有什麽新，有什麽改良呢？</p>
<p>由於媽媽的不准許，姐姐出嫁須坐花轎和行舊式婚禮是必定的了。於是我開始預想到一些很希奇動聰然而不能理解的事快又要搬演一回了；依照我們故鄕婚禮風俗，無論做一些什麽事情那是都得要擇個黄道吉日而後才可放心的做；在婚姻的大事，那更是無疑的了。在期前的一夕，半夜男家要「享獻」（？）了，女家的母親就要在這時候「哭好話（？）」了。據說假使男家「享獻」時放的砲和</p>
<h3>現代名人書畫</h3>
<p>浙江馬一浮先生法寳</p>
<p>女家母親「哭好話」第一聲相應合，那凖定兩親家都發大財了：花轎是必定要坐的，這是爲人在世祇坐一次的呀！新娘當坐進牢籠式的花轎裏時非哭出聲來不可，否則對於新娘的家嚴令兄要運道不順利的。新娘穿到男家去的鞋子一些不司踏着娘家地上的灰塵，這灰塵就是金子呀！在「拜堂」的時候，新郎要把「拜毯」擺得比新娘高一步，新娘覆頭的布請好福氣的太太「請方巾（？）」時打得重些，意思是以後新娘可以怕新郎家的任何人。在男家「享獻」時候所用的豬羊，就是以後作生兒育女的徴兆，假使豬羊嘴巴開的是生男，閉的是育女。在第一夜進　的時候，要新郎關房門，次日門是女的開。在第一夜，兩個新人是不講話的好，這樣據說以後的生活可，安閒；假使要講，所講的什麽話都是要吉利的……</p>
<p>爲了姐姐的出嫁，媽媽是成天的帶着傷感的調子而忙得不亦樂乎了；姐姐老是一聲不響地，在嘴角邊掛着收下了的愉快的勝利的笑渦</p>

<h3>童年斷片的回憶（九）</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>生來命苦，落胎在一個農婦底母胎裏，爸爸雖然讀了一輩子的書，究竟耕種是他底終老職業。大哥進過洋學堂以後，學會了許多浮氣習，一味托着長衫在村裏東跑西跑，惱得爸爸常時嘔聲嘆氣，媽媽却算寛懷，儘管安慰着爸爸說說「隨他去糊好了！」這話裏顯然也含有充分的嘆息之音。</p>
<p>七八月之間，農事是最忙不過了，所以四哥雖然年紀還輕輕，身材還是那麽短小，可不能與去年打比了，去年呢，割稻的時候，他儘舊是自間自在，除了早上和晚邊的兩次放牛，今年爸爸竟給了他一分大人的工作丨丨割稻，因此他不能兼顧到放牛了，放牛的事付與誰，便成了舉家的一個絕大的問題，雇人吧，開交不了，一天要供給一升半米的飯食，菜蔬還在外：多少也還要點工資才行，所以爸爸說不雇人，媽媽也願意，放牛畢究是成了問題。</p>
<p>我早就知道，這工作有輪上我的頭的趨勢，旣然决定了不另雇人來放。我想念及此，便不免有些蹙額皺眉，覺得晚邊一次，到不怎樣挨苦，只有在早上的模糊的晨光裏，要我丢下甜蜜　好夢，牽着一頭牛踏着濕潮潮的露水革地向野外走去，那是一回多麽孤寂而乏趣的事啊！</p>
<p>然而事實已成了這般僵局，有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>剛剛用了午飯，我正在灶電間底飯桌上練字，媽媽留了一桶水在我底前面經過，停住脚兒把我底名字呌了一聲；</p>
<p>「從明天起，你底責任重了！四哥明天要到田裏去割稻，放牛的工作是你的了！你要聽話，把牛食　得肥肥的，才好靠它冬耕哩！」</p>
<p>「媽媽，早晨我不去，晚邊的一次是可以的！」我放下了筆管，手按着紙頭說：</p>
<p>「早晨，我聽你早點醒好了，野外底空氣早晨格外清爽，就是到外邊去走走，也是好的，何况兼做了正經的事，在放牛呢！正是早晨要去，你不要蠢！」媽媽底慈祥的微笑統治了我底一切的抗議。</p>
<p>「好，媽媽一定　我那，明早！」我連早上的放牛也答應了，但是心底裏還是有些不願意。</p>
<p>「當然囉，我每天都是起得蠻早的，明天我一定呌你！」媽媽說了，便提步走去洗盌去了。</p>
<p>適巧是我在演最甜的夢的時候，媽媽便把我呌醒，隨着就說：「天亮了，天大亮了，壽兒，快起床去放牛呀！」</p>
<p>「晤」。我用兩隻手慌亂地擦着眼矢，嘴巴凸出寸來長，　　十三分地没興頭。</p>
<p>「聽呀，牛在欄裏呌起來了，呌你做小弟弟，你還不快些兒起來！」媽媽替我披上了衣，我還是欲動不動的。</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) Martial law has been declared here starting today. Unjustified removal of goods from the country is prohibited. Huang Qixiang has arrived from Xiamen. Representatives from both North and South have gathered here to plan a major undertaking. Rumor has it that Soong Ching-ling has also arrived. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Li Jishen, Chen Youren, Xu Qian, on the morning of the 18th,</p>
<p>arrived in Xiamen aboard the "SS China" and immediately proceeded to Zhangzhou. In the afternoon, they flew to the provincial capital together. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Huang Qiang assumed the position of Garrison Commander of Zhangzhou and Xiamen on the 19th. The headquarters is located in the old county government building. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Three Japanese destroyers left Xiamen on the 18th. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The Japanese newspaper has not been spreading rumors as intensely as before on the 18th and 19th. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang convened a meeting of key figures at his residence on the morning of the 19th. Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Miao Peinan, Yu Hanmou, Lin Yun, Huang Guangrui, etc. attended. The meeting lasted a long time. It is rumored that they will adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the Fujian situation. The Southwest's ultimate goal remains resisting Japan and suppressing the communists. Deng Longguang's entire army was ordered to deploy from Shaozhou to Huizhou on the 19th. Han Guiqing, director of the 19th Route Army's Guangdong office, stated on the 19th that he is solely responsible for rear area affairs. Whether Fujian takes action is unknown. Even if they do, it is not as serious as reported. Those who are overly sensitive are deliberately exaggerating the situation. The 19th Route Army and the First Group Army have always been united and shared hardships together. Guangdong has also provided much assistance to the 19th Route Army. No matter what changes occur, I believe they will be able to rely on each other as friends. External rumors are based on a lack of understanding of the two armies' history and personal relationships. Furthermore, rumors that I have left Guangzhou and the office has been relocated are completely unfounded. Zhang Peiqian, representative of Hunan, and Zheng Shaocheng, representative of Guizhou, both denied that Hunan and Guizhou are participating in the Fujian affair. There are rumors that Xiang Hanping is being monitored by Chen. Li Yangjing returned to the province from Huizhou on the evening of the 18th. Li Zongren sent a letter to the political council, stating that he is temporarily unable to return to Guangdong due to pressing matters. As for foreign and domestic policy, he has consistently expressed agreement. The political council dispatched Huang Jilu to Hong Kong on the 19th to meet with Hu Hanmin and returned to the province on the 19th. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Tonight, Xiao Focheng declared in the newspapers that he believes the 19th Route Army will not attack Guangdong, and because of their past meritorious service in suppressing the communists, they will not ally with the communists. (Eighteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guizhou Finance Commissioner and the representative of Hunan Chairman He Jian arrived in the province this afternoon and each published an article declaring that the provinces of Guizhou and Hunan are not involved in the Fujian movement, but will adopt the same attitude as Guangdong Province. The Guizhou Finance Commissioner also stated that there have been no negotiations between Fujian and Guizhou. Guizhou Chairman Wang Jialie is abiding by the orders of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee. (Nineteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Preparations for the economic conference to be held on November 22nd have now been completed. The conference will discuss fixing the currency and revitalizing commerce, among other issues. The conference will pay special attention to the people's livelihood and will adopt a basic plan to cope with the financial panic. (Nineteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The bank runs continue unabated this morning. Ten-dollar banknotes are currently not usable, and five-dollar notes are also subject to discounts when used. The prices of various goods have risen sharply by 25 percent, increasing the hardship of the poor. (Nineteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang and Others Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang received a telegram from Song Ziwen on the 17th and went to Shanghai. On the morning of the 18th, he held a temporary discussion meeting of the Economic Committee in Shanghai. Song will arrive in Nanjing in a few days. Wang returned to Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 19th. (Nineteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by train on the morning of the 19th. (Nineteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After returning to Nanjing, Wang went to his private residence in the Mausoleum New Village to rest. At 10:00 AM, he received Li Fulin, a member of the Central Committee, who came to Nanjing from Hong Kong, and discussed various issues for a long time. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>With the Situation Urgent, the Central Government Sincerely Considers Peace; A Telegram Was Sent to Inquire but No Reply Was Received; Further Persuasion Is Planned; If There Is a Good Plan to Save the Country, Suggestions Can Be Made and Adopted; Wang and Various Central Committee Members Agree to Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming said that after going to Shanghai, he and various Central Committee members who remained in Shanghai discussed the situation in the Southwest. Everyone agreed that since the country is still in a state of national crisis, no one would start a war. If there are different political views, they can be raised for discussion. As a result of the discussion, everyone unanimously decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and guide the situation towards peace. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the changing situation in Fujian, various rumors are still circulating. One Central Committee member said that the recent change in Fujian originated from Chen Mingshu's initiative. Its stated goal is to resist Japan and suppress bandits, but the Fujian authorities fear separation from unity and are still watching. It is still brewing and there has been no formal statement. The Central Government sent a telegram to inquire upon hearing the news, but no definite reply has been received. The Central Government's view is that in this serious national crisis, the entire country should unite as one. It is planning to send another telegram to Fujian urging persuasion. If there is a good plan to save the country, suggestions can be made and adopted. Do not create unnecessary complications and provide outsiders with excuses. Therefore, they are still optimistic about the Fujian affair, because the 19th Route Army became famous both at home and abroad in the Battle of Shanghai, and they will not act rashly. In the unfortunate event that something does happen, the Central Government will adopt a policy of appeasement and will never start a war lightly. Some people also propose sending senior officials to Fujian to inspect the actual situation and mediate the situation. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Rumor has it that the Central Government plans to send Chen Zhaoying to Fujian to investigate the truth, and plans to send Duan Xipeng to meet with Chen Mingshu to discuss everything. However, according to a senior official, sending someone to Fujian to mediate seems unnecessary at this time. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, sent a telegram to a senior official in Nanchang some time ago, briefly mentioning the recent situation in Fujian Province and his attitude. It is said that this telegram reached the Central Government on the 18th. (Nineteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Course of the Fujian Incident's Brewing; Chen Mingshu Travels Between Fujian and Guangdong; Xu Minghong and Others Encourage the Launch; Cai Tingkai and Dai Ji Both Express Dissent; Hu Hanmin's Views Not Entirely the Same</h3>
<p>▲Xiamen Correspondence: The transformation and brewing of the Fujian political situation has not been a matter of a day. Tracing back to Chen Mingshu's return from Europe, he has been actively proceeding until recently, when the date of its unveiling has approached. The figures involved in political discussion, apart from those from Chen's time in Guangdong, are mostly left-leaning youths, such as the Third Party and the Social Democratic Party. When Chen returned to China from Europe, he entered Fujian from Hong Kong to discuss special actions. As a result, Jiang Guangnai agreed with his proposal, but Cai Tingkai did not. Cai's idea was that in military terms, the 19th Route Army's forces cannot independently bear this difficult task. In terms of finance, Fujian's finances are extremely depleted. The 19th Route Army's current military strength and pay cannot even be self-sufficient, relying on the Central Government's monthly allocation of 600,000 and Guangdong's monthly assistance of 300,000. If launched, there will be nothing to eat. So Chen returned to Hong Kong to negotiate a Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian cooperation plan with Li Jishen, and invited Jiang Guangnai to Guangzhou to discuss the alliance with Chen Jitang. Chen Jitang firmly refused to participate upon Chen and Jiang's arrival in Guangdong, so Chen (Mingshu) left in anger. Cai knew that Guangdong would not participate, and his intention not to approve the launch was even more determined, and he sent Deng Shizeng to meet Jiang to return. This matter was suspended for a time. This was around June of this year. In the past three months, Chen has been repeatedly planning with his confidants in Hong Kong, still with Fujian as the center of the changes. Until October 6, Chen secretly came to Fujian again, flying from Zhangzhou to the provincial capital, and on the 14th, flying from the province to Zhangzhou, then passing through Xiamen and returning to Hong Kong. At that time, newspapers in the province and Xiamen were banned from publishing his itinerary, but Chen's visit still yielded no results. A few days ago, Jiang Guangnai returned to Guangdong to complete his son's marriage, and it was rumored that the Fujian situation would be judged based on whether Jiang returned from this trip. If he returned, the Fujian situation would change. Otherwise, Jiang would not continue as chairman, as Jiang firmly supports Chen's proposal. After Jiang returned to Guangdong, Chen Mingshu's confidants Xu Minghong and Zhang Yan also went to Hong Kong. Important figures of the 19th Route Army held an important meeting in Hong Kong. Xu Minghong and others strongly encouraged Chen Mingshu to launch. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to launch. Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai returned to Fujian together, and former Commander of the Fourth Army Huang Qixiang came with them. Jiang, Chen, and Huang arrived in Xiamen on the morning of November 10. Cai came from Quanzhou one day earlier and entered Zhangzhou together. They met at Cai's residence. At noon, Jiang, Chen, and Huang flew to the provincial capital, while Cai took a flight to the provincial capital on the 13th with Xu Minghong and Wei Yuhuai. At that time, Chairman Lin was in the province, intending to explain to Chen to cancel the launch, so he specially arranged to meet with Chen, but Chen's will was firm, so Lin returned to Nanjing. As for Dai Ji, the former Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Commander, he also arrived in Xiamen on the 11th from Shanghai by Dutch ship, entered Zhangzhou to visit Cai, and returned to Xiamen that evening. Dai and Cai held the same view. Chen and Jiang flew to the province, while Cai stayed in Zhangzhou to wait for Dai. After Cai met with Dai, he flew to the province on the 13th. Dai stayed in Xiamen to wait for later orders. On the 15th, Dai received a telegram from Cai, saying that things were slightly eased and could still be done, and asked him to come quickly. The headquarters sent a plane to pick up Dai and fly to the province. After Cai arrived in the province and met with Chen and Jiang, he still could not decide whether to launch. Cai urged Dai to go, and Chen and Jiang pushed Huang Qixiang to Hong Kong to welcome Li Jishen to make a final decision. Huang met Li in Hong Kong and returned first, passing through Xiamen on the 16th and arriving in the province on the 17th. Li's arrival in Fujian has been widely rumored, and Chen and others have scheduled a general assembly for the 20th to use public opinion to launch the movement.</p>
<p>As for Hu Hanmin's relationship with the Fujian affair, according to the 19th Route Army, it is not as important as Li Jishen's, because Hu shares the same political goals as Chen Mingshu in some aspects, but their political views are not entirely the same, and the new figures under Chen also strongly reject Hu, so it is difficult for Hu to come to Fujian. When Huang Qixiang came, Hu Mulan accompanied him, only handling some contacts on his father's orders. The relevant parties said that if things are launched, Soong Ching-ling may come to Fujian. (November 18)</p>
<h3>Various Important Figures Gather in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>▲Fuzhou Correspondence: In recent days, various important figures have arrived from Hong Kong, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, gathering in Fuzhou. As of today, those who have arrived include Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Huang Qixiang, Dai Ji, Huang Qiang, Weng Zhaoyuan, Zhang Xiang, Zeng Qian, Xu Minghong, Li Zhangda, etc. They have been meeting to discuss everything in the Provincial Government, the Pacification Headquarters, the Sanqiao Club, and Jiang's residence on Wushi Mountain. Therefore, rumors are circulating and the atmosphere is very tense. It is expected that the political situation in Fujian Province will have a new turn. Today (18th), slogans of the Fujian Cultural Movement General Alliance were found in the city, which aroused social attention. It is also reported that the provincial capital's agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, and military circles are scheduled to hold a Fujian public meeting at the public sports ground at 9:00 AM on the 20th, and a demonstration parade. Currently, various organizations are actively preparing leaflets and slogans for distribution and posting. There will also be proposals and telegrams to be submitted at the meeting, requiring the military and political authorities to accept them. As for how the authorities will respond, it is currently impossible to predict. Since the northern Fujian Red bandits were repelled and the southern Fujian bandits surrendered, the local area is still peaceful, but the finances are extremely depleted due to repeated droughts and bandit disasters. Commerce and agriculture are extremely withered, and tax revenues have sharply decreased, making the balance of income and expenditure extremely difficult. (November 18)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Actively Deploys Defenses</h3>
<p>▲Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the turmoil occurred in Fujian Province, Guangdong's political position has been to protect the territory and ensure the safety of the people, and not to get involved in the vortex. There have been new deployments in military affairs. First, regarding the western border defenses, in recent days, Li Hanhun, commander of the Independent Third Division, decided to patrol the West River and inspect the defenses of various troops downstream of Wuzhou, providing instructions on the deployment of the troops, and paying particular attention to the border areas of Guangning and Huaiji above Wuzhou. The military and police of Sihui County, which is adjacent to the Guangxi border, have been ordered to conduct winter defense inspections of travelers to and from the border within a time limit. Near Liangyang, the second regiment of instructors, led by Liang Gongfu, has also been transferred to garrison there. As for the eastern border defenses, because they are close to the Fujian border, the deployments are even more tense. It has been found that the Chaozhou-Shantou area has recently been garrisoned by parts of the Independent Second Division, led by Zhang Ruigui, one part guarding the sea mouth of Shantou, and the other part guarding the Huanggang area on the Fujian border. The third regiment of the division, led by Zhong Fangjun, is stationed in Chaoan, the third independent regiment, led by Zhang Wentao, is stationed in Shantou, the first regiment, led by Ou Hong, is stationed in Raoping, and the Jiyaoshu regiment of instructors is stationed in Puning. As for Jiaoling County, which borders Shanghang and Wuping in Fujian Province, the Huang Renhuan regiment of the Independent First Division is concentrated in one place and defensive works are being built. In addition, Meixian has a special service battalion of the Third Army and a regiment of instructors, Pingyuan County has the 21st regiment of the Seventh Division of the Third Army, led by Huang Gu, Xingning County has the 14th regiment of the Fifth Division of the Second Army, led by Liu Shunan, and the second regiment of the Independent Second Division, led by Chen Xinrong. Wuhua County has the Ma Yi regiment of the Fifth Division of the Second Army, Heyuan County has the Wu Junsheng regiment of the Fifth Division of the Second Army, and Lufeng and Haifeng counties have the Luo Xiuli regiment of the Fifteenth regiment of the Fifth Division.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the European Situation: The Non-Aggression Pact Between Germany and Poland</h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>One of the most significant cancerous growths in Europe is the Corridor issue between Germany and Poland. Recently, the National Socialist Party of Germany achieved electoral victory. If it adheres to its uncompromising and forward-looking political program, not only can the Treaty of Versailles be abandoned, but the Corridor between Germany and Poland will immediately become a major problem. An armed conflict will be difficult to avoid. However, Germany has been able to slightly shift its obstinate policy, first reaching an understanding with Poland to draft a non-aggression agreement. Based on the general situation, it should not plunge Central Europe into an extreme deadlock again.</p>
<p>Poland, from the early 14th century to the 18th century, was once a powerful nation in Eastern Europe. At that time, Warsaw was as prosperous as Paris is today among European cities. However, after being partitioned three times by Prussia, Austria, and Russia in 1772, 1793, and 1795, it lost its independent status. The former prosperity disappeared, leaving Polish nationalists to yearn for their homeland. Although they repeatedly rose up to resist the strong enemy with their blood, they ultimately failed due to insufficient strength. Until the end of World War I, the Polish independence movement began with the establishment of a National Committee in Paris in 1917. At that time, it received the assistance of France, and the Allied nations recognized it as the official representative body. Thus, the Polish government was established under the protection of the Treaty of Versailles. With the efforts of the Polish people themselves, it quickly became one of the strong nations in Eastern Europe in a short period.</p>
<p>However, Poland contained two contradictions from the beginning. First, it lacked access to the sea. Second, it had no passage to the sea. According to President Wilson's Fourteen Points, the principle of national self-determination was at its peak. How could Poland, confined to Central Europe, obtain a seaport and a passage to the sea? Moreover, British Prime Minister Lloyd George also opposed territorial division. Therefore, Poland's difficult situation was a minor matter. The inability of France to contain the rise of Germany was even more significant. Thus, the compromise was to separate Danzig from Germany and establish it as a free city, while opening up a Corridor as Poland's passage to the sea. Under the circumstances at the time, it could meet the spirit of national self-determination and satisfy the demands of the newly emerging Poland. The European situation seemed to be able to coexist peacefully and advance towards peace.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the separation of mainland Germany from East Prussia aroused resentment among the German people. However, due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, they had no choice but to submit. In terms of national defense, Germany had almost completely removed its barriers due to the establishment of Poland. Even President Hindenburg had to pass through foreign territory to return to his hometown in East Prussia. Thus, the Germans' dissatisfaction grew. Patriotic fervor spread throughout the country. At the beginning of his administration, Hitler set the goal of abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, while France insisted on security guarantees. In other words, it wanted to ensure its own security with military force and support the demands of France's allies in Central Europe with economic power. By further analyzing the European political situation, one can see that the establishment of the German-Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig was indeed one of the key factors in Poland's demands. However, the Corridor and the Free City of Danzig were purely German in terms of ethnicity, and it was difficult to fully explain the reason for their separation in terms of geography. However, the reason why they were ultimately separated was due to the influence of France. This is where Germany's dissatisfaction came from. It was not just dissatisfaction. Once it had sufficient strength, it would seize the opportunity to quickly rise up to recover its old territories. Poland was also highly vigilant, constantly guarding against being exploited by the enemy. Therefore, Central European countries such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania all followed France's lead, adhering to the Treaty of Versailles to isolate Germany. The reason why Hitler raised his arms and the whole country responded was precisely because of this. However, from the perspective of current international diplomacy, Hitler's actions are very similar to the blind and reckless path of Japanese militarists. The result may inevitably lead to self-entrapment in a difficult situation. Germany's current strength is insufficient to oppose France. It is surrounded militarily, and it is difficult to find a safe and sure path economically. Therefore, everyone is concerned about Germany's future. Unexpectedly, Hitler was able to abandon his hardline policy, no longer antagonize Poland, and first sign a non-aggression pact. Whether the result can truly open up a path to peace in Europe and cut off the current cancerous growth between Germany and Poland is still a question. However, during this period, Germany and France will not engage in conflict due to the German-Polish issue. At least the crisis of the future European political situation will be reduced in its explosive component. The situation of temporary stability has one more counterweight. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Union Restore Normal Diplomatic Relations; Preparations for Commercial Talks; Moscow Agrees to Bullitt as Envoy to Russia; Former Russian Ambassador to Japan to be Stationed in Washington D.C.</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US State Department has taken practical steps to recognize Soviet Russia, having instructed all US diplomatic representatives around the world to begin formal exchanges and social events with Soviet diplomatic representatives. At the same time, it ordered that Soviet passports be handled in the same way as passports from other governments recognized by the US. Secretary of State Hull also made a radio address, stating that the successful completion of the resumption of diplomatic relations negotiations was gratifying and that this was a timely solution that would help to resolve international entanglement issues. He also stated that Moscow has agreed to the appointment of Bullitt as the US Ambassador to Russia. Bullitt previously attended the London Economic Conference. It is also reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov first received a telegram from US Senator Borah congratulating on the best friendly relations between the two countries. Litvinov formally received the Russian Embassy today. Some Republican leaders, such as Littell, stated that as long as there are no loans made to Soviet Russia, they see no problem with recognizing Soviet Russia. The vast majority of Democrats support the resumption of diplomatic relations. The US government now hopes to gain economic benefits after recognition. It is estimated that exports to Russia in 1934 will reach US$350 million, which will easily provide jobs for thousands of unemployed workers. (18th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and the new US Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, met today for an hour and 15 minutes. The content of the discussion was not disclosed. Litvinov later hosted a banquet for the US cabinet members currently in Washington, D.C. Bullitt and Jones, the director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, were invited to attend. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Reconstruction Finance Corporation stated today that various commercial talks are underway in preparation after the US recognition of Soviet Russia. Russian representative Litvinov will discuss the cotton issue with the State Department. Agricultural Bureau advisor White Radcliff stated that the method of shipping a large amount of cotton to Soviet Russia depends only on several years of lending. It is estimated that Soviet Russia can consume US cotton worth $50 million and cotton textiles worth $30 million. After the restoration of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia, annual trade will be worth approximately $520 million. People in Washington welcome the US-Soviet agreement, believing that it can revitalize commerce. Secretary of State Hull expressed the opinion that the world's current deadlock can be expected to improve in the future, and US General Dawes also said that the recognition of Soviet Russia should have good results. The only opposing argument from the US came from Senator Robinson, who called it a big mistake that would harm America's best interests. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Union Diplomatic Restoration Motivated by Good Neighbor Policy; Joint Maintenance of World Peace; President Roosevelt's Speech; Monetary Illness Cannot Be Cured in Short Term; Reprimand of Opponents of Financial Plans</h3>
<p>Savannah US President Roosevelt gave a speech here today at the Georgia Bicentennial Commemoration, stating that the main motivation for the US recognition of Soviet Russia was to maintain world peace, and therefore this move stemmed from the spirit of Johnson's peaceful good neighbor policy, and he believed that Soviet Russia would also be motivated by the same. US President further criticized those who do not agree with the government's monetary policy, stating that we cannot cure a ten-year illness in a year, nor can we restore social and economic order equally across the country and in all sectors. Some modern conservatives accuse the government of engaging in a huge experiment. He recalled that the British also received the same criticism when they built new colonies in the American wilderness. (18th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Talk; Hints at Japan's Growing Suspicion of Russia; US-Soviet Union Join Hands, Willing to Strive Together for Peace</h3>
<p>(New York) Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov made a statement to the press after exchanging notes, stating that the exchange of notes is not only to create the necessary conditions for quickly and smoothly resolving outstanding issues, but more importantly, to open a new page in the development of genuine friendship and peaceful cooperation between the two largest republics. Yesterday's actions will have the most favorable impact on the issue of maintaining peace when providing full convenience for the various possibilities of economic cooperation. All people devoted to peace will rejoice in this move. Litvinov further stated that all countries in the world currently maintain normal relations, but in some situations, suspicion and jealousy are secretly growing behind the scenes of this normal relationship. We and the United States do not hope to maintain this customary, technical normal relationship. We and the United States have had no real conflicts in the past, and we do not hope to have such conflicts in the future. The points of connection between the two countries already exist and will continue to increase. Our common ground for economic and cultural cooperation and for striving for peace will continue to expand. Litvinov continued that in the past sixteen years, due to the lack of diplomatic relations, the erroneous and false views on the situation in the Soviet Union in the United States have become more and more serious. Many people have made it their duty to spread myths about the Soviet Union that are far from reality. Therefore, when the President expressed his willingness to understand the Soviet government's policy towards foreign expatriates and to know about all aspects of the lives of American expatriates in the Soviet Union (who will arrive in large numbers one after another), I was not at all surprised and told him as much as possible. When the President asked if Americans in the Soviet Union had freedom of religion, I immediately assured the President, pointing out the Soviet law regarding religious belief. The President also asked about the legal status of foreigners in the Soviet Union, and I explained that foreigners in the Soviet Union must fully abide by Soviet law. Foreigners are not allowed any special status. I asked the President in another letter to believe that the Soviet government's relations with other governments are based on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Litvinov further stated that the mutual material demands of the two countries cannot be resolved in a short period of time, because the Soviet government's established policy is to never allow these problems to be resolved before normal relations are established. However, the exchange of opinions on this issue has revealed the good intentions of the two countries and the desire to resolve this issue in the shortest possible time. To prove our good intentions, we have decided to abandon one of our demands without waiting for the final resolution of the mutual demands, namely, the compensation for the US expeditionary force in Siberia. Our move was based on consideration of some of the US actions during that period. When I visited the State Department, I was well aware of these actions. (18th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Candidate for Soviet Ambassador to the US</h3>
<p>(Washington) After the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union, the US sent State Department Assistant Berle as the first US Ambassador to Russia. The Soviet government has recently informed the State Department that it agrees. As for the Soviet Ambassador to the US, according to sources, it will be Troianovsky, who is well-versed in Japanese affairs. Whether this will become a reality depends entirely on whether the US government agrees. Troianovsky was previously the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, and he resigned a few months ago to return to his country and take on another position. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Moscow Broadcasts Songs to America</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, the local Transportation Committee specially broadcasted a radio ensemble to American listeners. This was the second time such special songs were broadcast to America. The first broadcast was warmly received by the American side and was exceptionally successful. The purpose of this kind of changing broadcast is to promote cultural closeness between the Soviet Union and the United States. (TASS, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans Countermeasures: Wary of U.S.-Russian Rapprochement; Declares Continued Peaceful Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government maintains a calm attitude towards the U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union. However, Foreign Minister Hirota is working hard on countermeasures, anticipating how the attitudes of the U.S. and Russia towards Japan will develop as a result of the restoration of diplomatic relations. However, Japan does not believe that the U.S.-Russian rapprochement will have a direct impact on their policies towards Japan. The fundamental belief is that policies towards Russia and the U.S. should not be shaken by this. Japan will pursue peaceful diplomatic efforts with both countries, using means such as dispatching goodwill envoys to the U.S., and reopening negotiations for the transfer of the North Manchuria Railway and proposing a joint 日俄 “Manchukuo” border commission to Russia. The aim is to eliminate an indescribable atmosphere of hostility. However, it should be noted that a faction in the U.S. is using the opportunity of the U.S.-Russian rapprochement to advocate strengthening the Stimson Doctrine. Whether the Soviet Union will play tricks and engage in closer relations with China than necessary to contain Japan is also a concern. Regarding this point, Foreign Minister Hirota will not be swayed by such containment measures against Japan. He will consistently stand on a fair viewpoint, prioritize the sound development of “Manchukuo,” implement measures to ensure peace in the Far East, and expresses determination to advance towards the ultimate victory of Japan's peaceful efforts. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<h3>Pseudo-British Diplomatic Advisor Issues Unreasonable Warning to the U.S., Threatening Pacific War to Prevent U.S.-Russian Economic Ties</h3>
<p>(Washington) Li Bailangsen (formerly the chief editor of the Far East Times), the diplomatic advisor to "Manchukuo" stationed in Washington, issued a warning, stating that if the United States lends money or extends credit to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union uses it to conduct preparations in Central Asia and Siberia, then the United States may be drawn into a Pacific war as a result of its economic and financial ties with Russia. The prospect of peace remains bleak; even a minor border incident could trigger a dangerous situation and plunge the United States into a war over its investments. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>World Media and Russian Press Praise Roosevelt's Vision</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Communist Party's mouthpiece, Pravda, commenting on the establishment of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations, praised Roosevelt's initiative, saying that Roosevelt overcame many prejudices in being able to put forward this motivating factor for success. The newspaper said, "A practical policy that correctly recognizes our country's great international importance has prevailed. What seemed impossible for sixteen years has been realized in a matter of days." The newspaper also said that the factors forcing a change in America's Soviet diplomatic policy have become increasingly urgent and firm recently, so America could no longer maintain its old ways. According to Pravda, the current American authorities' abandonment of their traditional non-recognition policy is the greatest expression of the Soviet Union's strength and importance. Although some countries, initially including the United States, were unwilling to acknowledge the huge changes that had taken place on one-sixth of the world's area, the Soviet Union has finally achieved a great victory. As for why the Soviet Union has become the greatest factor in the world, the only explanation lies in our economic, political, and military strength. The newspaper further claimed that the Soviet Union's success in foreign policy is sufficient to demonstrate the strong and powerful position it occupies in the struggle for peace. To be precise, today's world is still threatened by the dangers of several imperialist powers, who have decided to sacrifice the territory and wealth of others to compensate for their internal affairs. Pravda pointed out the failure of the disarmament conference, the crisis in both East and West, and the competition in armaments, and said, "The new victory of the Soviet Union's peace policy has a special importance in this atmosphere." The newspaper added that November 16 should be an important day in the development of international relations and concluded, "The Soviet Union has become the greatest nation politically and economically, and even the greatest capitalist countries must take it into consideration." (TASS, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Press Says Japanese Aggression Contributed to U.S.-Soviet Rapprochement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although there are many things that the German press should pay attention to regarding America’s 法　上的 recognition of the Soviet Union, it still comments on the establishment of the U.S.-Soviet agreement, generally viewing it as a failure of Japanese policy. The "Attack Report" even stated that although the U.S.-Soviet agreement cannot be immediately viewed as a treaty of war, it can be considered to contain such a nature to a certain extent. The "Hamburg Free Press" said, "The establishment of the new U.S.-Soviet relationship was actually promoted by Japan. Although this result is not what Tokyo wants, we should know that anyone who exerts oppression will inevitably provoke a reaction. The Soviet Union's alliance with the United States to seek peaceful interests is entirely influenced by Japan's external aggression. Another center has formed in world politics, and European powers are merely observers without participation. This is unprecedented. The old forces of European countries are declining daily in world politics. This matter is clear proof. The U.S. and Russia do not belong to the League of Nations and are now walking hand in hand, which shows that it is not only Germany that does not rely on the League of Nations." The "Berlin Daily" said, "Germany has no direct interest in Washington's newly concluded agreement in political terms. However, the fact that the Soviet Union guarantees not to threaten the United States with commercial or other types of espionage activities is more relevant to us. Regarding this and other issues, we can enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment accurately interpreted by the Rapallo Treaty. The U.S.-Soviet rapprochement concerns the Far Eastern question. It would be too early to say at this time whether the United States has made certain promises to the Soviet Union to oppose Japan. However, as we see it, any rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia will ultimately be to deal with Japan." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>French and Czech Press: U.S.-Soviet Alliance Can Curb Japanese Ambitions</h3>
<p>(Paris) The semi-official newspaper Le Temps stated today that the United States did not gain any economic benefits from recognizing the Soviet Union. The newspaper said that the U.S. President's decision to recognize the Soviet Union was out of fear that Japanese aggression would extend to Siberia. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Prague) Czech newspapers have commented extensively on the U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union. "干戈甫报" stated that the friendship between the U.S. and Russia was destined by fate, as there were no obstacles between the two countries, and there were several circumstances that could promote the unity of the two countries. The two countries have a common enemy, this enemy is strong and resilient, so it makes it necessary for the U.S. and Russia to unite. "人民报" stated that the comprehensive security of Russia in international politics has now completed a major step, and at the same time, it can enhance the forces of peace, because the common policy of the U.S. and Russia can eliminate Japan's military aggression. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Citing Bandit Suppression, Japanese Troops Move to Jidong: Hirose Claims Russia Need Not Worry</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Lieutenant General Hirose, who is personally commanding the "bandit" suppression operation in Jilin, moved his headquarters by train to prepare for the so-called third stage of the "bandit" suppression operation. He declared beforehand that his troops, under no circumstances, would invade Soviet territory. He intends to avoid any action that could provoke a Russian-Japanese conflict, so Russia need not worry about this, because we are only paying attention to eliminating illegal elements in Jilin Province.

<h3>New York Ukrainians Oppose U.S. Recognition of Soviet Union; Clash with Communists</h3>
<p>(New York) Last night, 7,000 Ukrainians in New York held a rally to protest the U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union. A clash occurred between the police, Ukrainians, and Communists. Communists threw bricks and glass bottles, injuring three police officers. One of those carrying the Ukrainian flag was also hospitalized due to injuries. After the march, the Ukrainians held a meeting and passed a resolution requesting President 斯福 to demand guarantees from the Soviet Union that it would not kill Ukrainians within Russia.

<h3>Franco-Russian Trade Negotiations: Important Meeting Held in Paris</h3>
<p>(Paris) The trade negotiations between France and Russia have been going on for a long time. Today, representatives of the two countries held an important meeting at the Ministry of Commerce. The chief representative on the Soviet side was the head of the Soviet trade mission in France, 顾赖维池. On the French side were the Minister of Commerce 朗爱那克, the Minister of Agriculture 意, and experts from relevant departments. The two sides have long reached an agreement on most of the key points of the commercial agreement. What is being discussed today is entirely the 本材 and butter oil issues. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Build West Asia Railway; Connecting India and Egypt; Facilitating Troop Transport; Soviet Union Pays Attention and Believes It Is Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>(Moscow) An Egyptian newspaper recently published a plan for a railway from India through Persia to Egypt. This news has attracted the attention of the Red Army's mouthpiece. The newspaper published a lengthy article discussing the matter, strongly stating that Britain and Russia will compete for influence in West Asia, especially in Persia. It is said that the road is planned to be built from Karakaji, passing through Persia and Iraq, to Haifa in Palestine. Once this road is completed, Britain can safely transport troops and munitions between its colonies and mandated territories, because in the event of serious developments, sea 　 is difficult to secure. Britain is also strengthening its influence in Persia, because once this road is completed, Persia and India can be closely connected. The Soviet Union has not yet taken action to resist it, but this road plan is a special kind of realization. Persia will not 　 give new 　 rights to Britain, and France, due to its interests in Syria, will suffer significant damage and will be difficult to endure. Moreover, France also has plans to penetrate Persia and Syria. Furthermore, at this time of economic urgency, Britain has no financial resources to undertake this great project.

<h3>Efforts to Save Disarmament Negotiations in Geneva Yield No Results; France Refuses to Change Attitude Towards Germany; Britain and Italy Plan to Propose New Plan for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, British Foreign Secretary Simon, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and Italian representative Salagna held talks to discuss the future of the Disarmament Conference. Afterwards, Foreign Secretary Simon met with Wilson, the U.S. representative Davies's agent. It is understood that today's talks did not establish any concrete results, and consultations will continue tomorrow. The French side admitted that it could not agree with the British position, and said that Britain had not yet put forward any concrete proposals, only expressing the hope that it could find a way to break the current impasse. Today, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour declared to the press that the French position was no different from that in the October 14 declaration, that is, France could not allow Germany to immediately restore its military, although Germany had withdrawn from the League of Nations, but France could not change its attitude. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from the U.S., Britain, France, and Italy will meet here this afternoon to decide whether to maintain a united front regarding Germany's demands for armaments. It is reported that Britain and Italy believe that a united front is no longer appropriate, but France still insists on its original position. It is also reported that Britain and Italy advocate a new plan to continue the British disarmament draft on the one hand and reopen negotiations with Germany outside Geneva on the other. According to this plan, the period of hesitation will be shortened to one year, and countries will be allowed to possess certain types of weapons that other countries have. As for the U.S. position, it has not yet been determined. U.S. representative Wilson has requested instructions from the State Department. In addition to Wilson, those attending the meeting this afternoon will include Chairman Henderson, British Foreign Secretary Simon, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and Italian representative 狄苏拉格. Henderson said that today's meeting was a meeting of the countries represented by British Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration in the Main Committee on October 14, and the current situation will be given a very detailed consideration. The atmosphere in Geneva in the past two days has been somewhat nervous. Politicians from various countries secretly entered and exited the corridors of various hotels and consulates. This morning, Paul-Boncour met with Simon at the 蒲里伐奇 Hotel for one hour and fifteen minutes, refused to release any statements, and then went directly to see Henderson for one hour before sneaking out the back door. Italian representative 狄苏拉格 then went to see Simon after visiting Henderson, and Wilson also visited Simon. Everyone was silent about the details of the talks and refused to express their opinions. Therefore, outsiders speculate that if there is no sign of important developments in the situation, there must be a gap between the positions of the various countries that is not easy to eliminate. There is also an unconfirmed report here that Mussolini has authorized Italian representative 狄苏拉格 to invite other countries to reopen negotiations with Germany in Italy if it seems acceptable to all parties. Those with inside information here also believe that even if negotiations with Germany are not reopened, there will be at least one meeting between Italian Prime Minister 索里尼, German Chancellor Hitler, British Prime Minister MacDonald, and French Prime Minister Sarraut to discuss the issue of reopening negotiations, and the location may be in Italy. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The declaration of French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour this morning, the talks between Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson and representatives of various countries, and the opinions expressed independently by various parties all stated that the views agreed upon by the entire Disarmament Conference and France on October 14 this year (the day Germany left Geneva) should be maintained. This is very obvious. The French representative in Geneva did not surprise his colleagues with his attitude, because the French representative had agreed to the principles supported by the entire delegation on the advice of British Foreign Secretary Simon on October 14 in very clear terms. His declaration was sympathetic in tone and contained no objections to the content. However, Simon and Eden seemed to reveal today that the British government's attitude was different from that in October this year. The British government seemed very eager to find a new basis for discussion, because he believed that the proposed plan in October had no hope of success. Although Simon and Eden did not express this clearly, it could be seen from the questions raised by the two to Henderson and Paul-Boncour. As for Paul-Boncour, he reiterated the important declaration he made to the press this morning. Paul-Boncour also seemed to have made it clear to the representatives that France was absolutely unwilling to have the Geneva talks conducted elsewhere. Tomorrow, Henderson will invite representatives from France, Britain, and Italy, the Greek Minister to France 波利约斯, and the Czech Foreign Minister贝勒斯 to meet again in the name of a tea party. If there are no results, they will meet again. Therefore, Henderson requested British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour to stay in Geneva for a few more days. In the evening, Paul-Boncour met with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol and Yugoslav representative 佛地池. In addition, it is generally believed that Paul-Boncour only discussed the disarmament issue with the Polish representative and did not involve the German-Polish Agreement. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<h3>Italy May Follow Germany and Withdraw from the League of Nations; Decision to be Made at Party Congress in December</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Party Congress will be held on December 24 to discuss whether Italy should remain in the League of Nations or withdraw. According to reliable sources, according to the current situation, it seems that the withdrawal faction will prevail. According to the Fascist Party Congress held this spring, this matter was seriously considered, but it was decided to postpone it until December for further study, because it was still desired to observe the trend of the international situation.

<h3>Difficulties in Compiling the Japanese Budget; Requests for Restoration from Various Ministries Exceed 300 Million Yen; Military Criticizes Ministry of Finance for Unclear Understanding of International Situation; Saito and Takahashi Seek Political Resolution</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the budget items requested for restoration by various ministries have been so numerous that they have become an unprecedentedly huge amount. Unexpectedly, the deadline has had to be postponed. The Ministry of Finance originally announced at the Cabinet meeting on the 17th that the deadline for these requests from various ministries would be Monday. Therefore, various ministries began emergency meetings, only to submit these requests first. However, an investigation now shows that the total number of restorations requested by various ministries is no less than 300 million yen. At the cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Takahashi said that, except for new requests with financial sources, no restoration would be approved, and he would try to adhere to this policy as much as possible. With such a large number of restoration requests, the complexity of the budget compilation problem is self-evident, and its future can be described as difficult. (Nichi-Ren News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the discussion on the restoration request at the Army Budget Provincial Conference on the 18th, it was decided that the items to be restored were approximately 33 million yen for the Manchurian Incident expenses, approximately 70 million yen for equipment preparation expenses, and approximately 5 million yen for fuel research expenses, totaling 180 million yen. In addition, the army is also very concerned about rural countermeasures and other domestic policy issues that require considerable funding. As a result of the army's consideration of this matter, there is some flexibility in the restoration requests, except for the Manchurian Incident expenses. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance only approved 178 million yen of the Navy's new budget request of 440 million yen for the 2nd Replenishment Plan. The Navy feels extremely uneasy and dissatisfied. Minister of the Navy Osumi urgently convened a meeting of the top leaders yesterday to secretly discuss countermeasures. Although today is Sunday, they are still fully mobilized and gathered at the Ministry of the Navy to discuss concrete methods for requesting restoration. Then, Minister of the Navy Osumi will submit it to the regular cabinet meeting on the 21st. At the same time, Minister of the Navy Osumi will meet with Finance Minister Takahashi privately and resort to the final stages of political negotiation. The Navy believes that the reduced items, especially (二) the labor wage assessment for ship modification expenses, (一) the labor wage assessment for ship construction expenses, (一) the restoration of expenses for restricted non-treaty warships, (一) The increase in the material cost is the core of the second replenishment plan, so they all advocate using the brains of the entire Navy to thoroughly implement the restoration, and the attitude is very tough. Regardless of any sacrifice, they are determined to fulfill the country's defense. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the budget plan reviewed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the army's regular expenses were reduced by 5,119,000 yen, and the navy's were increased by 20,178,000 yen. The army's temporary expenses were reduced by 16 million yen, and the navy's were only increased by 4 million yen. From the army's perspective, the international crisis is gradually becoming serious, but the military budget has been cut by the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Finance's understanding of the outside world is indeed very confused. However, from the perspective of the financial groups, if the Ministry of Finance's review plan is passed, 29,161,400 yen can be saved. Even after deducting 170 million yen from the independent postal accounting, more than 120 million yen can be saved, so the financial community praises Takahashi, while the military hates Takahashi. Prime Minister Saito is very worried about this situation. Yesterday, he stopped going to Hayama for recuperation and stayed in Tokyo to help Finance Minister Takahashi resolve the budget案 for the next fiscal year. (Hualian News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Fate of India-Japan Conference to be Decided in One or Two Days</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The India-Japan trade conference encountered misfortune because the Indian side put forward the final plan. On the 18th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed representative Sawada, instructing him to work hard to break the deadlock, while being aware of the worst-case scenario. Therefore, at the next meeting, the Japanese side will put forward the following revised requests that take into account the minimum interests of the Japanese side as a final compromise.</p>
<p>(1) Request confirmation of the principle of realistically ensuring the import volume of Japanese cotton cloth of 400 million square yards.</p>
<p>(2) Within the cotton cloth category allocation rate, double the percentage of the Indian plan's 80% discount to make the import volume of processed cotton cloth suitable for the current situation.</p>
<p>(3) Revise the super-extended percentage of the category-specific and period-specific allocation to 10% each.</p>
<p>(4) With regard to the most-favored-nation treatment for miscellaneous goods and rayon, and the application of tariff rates, etc., a formal declaration should be made.</p>
<p>If the Indian side insists on the Indian plan, it will be difficult for the conference to improve. Therefore, the fate of the conference will be determined within these one or two days depending on the attitude of the Indian side. However, if the conference fails, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will implement a comprehensive and forceful trade policy to ensure that nothing is left out. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Criticized Domestically Changes Gold Purchase Plan; Reduces Purchase Quantity; Gold Price Gradually Becomes Fixed; Farmers' Strike Fails</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that the U.S. President has accepted the advice of several advisors and is currently reducing the amount of gold purchased by the government and ordering that the price of newly mined gold in the country be maintained at $33.56, without changes, in an attempt to restore some order in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, at this time, the price of the gold dollar has stabilized as a result of the reduction in gold purchases and the temporary fixing of the gold price by the Financial Relief Corporation. However, some observers also say that the government's change in the gold purchase plan is due to the desire to adjust after the recent results before continuing. (Guomin News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Board of Directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution today, requesting the government to return to the gold standard as quickly as possible, while vehemently criticizing the government's current fiscal policy, saying that it would cause huge confusion and distrust and particularly attacking the government's gold-buying plan, requesting the President to stop it immediately.

<p>(St. Louis) Today, Democratic Senator Wheeler predicted that after 明国会reopens, the 通货议案inflation bill will be passed, but the question is whether its inflationary means will be to adopt uncontrollable paper money or to use the more easily secured silver as currency.

<p>(Madison) The leaders of the U.S. Midwest farmers' strike today admitted that the strike had failed. According to reports, tenants, farm laborers, and some landowners, under the leadership of Lino, organized the Farmers' Holiday Association to launch a strike to prevent the sale of agricultural products in the market in order to raise prices. In the short term, it seemed to be victorious. They had used coercive methods several times to intercept milk trucks and vehicles transporting agricultural products and dump them on the ground, but most farmers were still willing to sell their produce and tried to transport it to the market, and the victory of the strikers was ultimately unsustainable.

<p>Madrid – Spain is now encountering the same political turmoil as before King Alfonso XIII abdicated in 1931. The results of the parliamentary elections held in July 1931 caused the Conservative Party to collapse, while the power of the Socialist and Republican parties greatly increased, leading to the drafting of a constitution. However, this constitution has led to a stalemate in the Law for the Defense of the Republic. The authorities have invoked this law to confiscate the property of many people and illegally arrested so-called reactionaries, aggravating imprisonments. The government's schemes are varied. The most peculiar is prohibiting workers from seeking employment outside their hometowns, causing tens of thousands of households who leave their hometowns every year to seek winter work to be trapped in their hometowns. Another is closing church schools, depriving half of Spanish children who study in church schools of their education. Moreover, half of the national population is illiterate, and the government does not provide schools. Furthermore, the majority of people are devoutly religious. The Spanish national character still values independence, so there are many political parties and their platforms are particularly complex. Therefore, the outcome of this election is difficult to predict, and the creation of a restoration is also expected. (Eighteenth Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) – A copper-iron alloy method, which scientists around the world have repeatedly tried unsuccessfully and has become a mystery, has now been completed by Professor Takeo Tozawa, head of the Department of Mining and Metallurgy at Waseda University, after more than ten years of struggle. This new alloy shines brightly in the alloy world. It is reported that this alloy is made by adding iron to copper, and the iron content varies depending on its level, and can create more than a thousand kinds of new alloys. Its properties also have some differences. In particular, some alloys resemble bronze and brass and have the gloss and function of friction.

<h3>Yamuguchi Soon to be Received; Tao Shangming and Others Ordered to Yamuguchi to Negotiate; Most of the Yamuguchi Japanese Army Stationed in Northern Manchuria; Reception to Begin on the 25th</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issue of receiving the passes along the Great Wall, Okamura has recently come to Beiping and agreed with the Japanese side to hand them over. The 14th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, stationed in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, has been ordered to be stationed in northern Manchuria. The Japanese army stationed in Shanhaiguan has also mostly departed for Jinzhou in recent days and is gradually moving north. Only a garrison of over two hundred men remains stationed in Shanhaiguan. As for the Japanese army stationed at Gubeikou and Xifengkou, they will only be allowed to withdraw next spring. After Okamura's departure to the east, Shibayama of the Japanese Embassy is responsible for all negotiation matters. Shibayama, seeing that the Japanese army in Yamuguchi has been gradually withdrawing, notified our side to expedite the reception procedures. Upon receiving Shibayama's notification, the authorities immediately dispatched Tao Shangming and Zhu Shiqin to Yamuguchi to negotiate the reception measures. Tao and others believe that the Japanese garrison stationed in Yamuguchi is under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Garrison Army. They plan to first go to Tianjin tomorrow to negotiate with the Japanese Army Commander Nakamura. After completing the matter, they will then accompany representatives from the Hebei Provincial Government and the Magistrate of Linyu County, Yin Shousong, to Yamuguchi to discuss handover procedures with Endo, the staff officer of the 14th Brigade of the Japanese Army stationed in Yamuguchi. The reception is expected to begin on the 25th. After the reception, the Linyu County Government will be moved back to the old government office in Yamuguchi City from the Ocean Town. The security of Yamuguchi will be the responsibility of the security team stationed in Changli, which will be transferred there. The other passes, such as Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Lengkou, and Jieling, will also be received successively. However, because the Japanese army at each of these passes will only be completely withdrawn next spring, only the local administration can be received first. As for the small passes, there are many, and the number of security teams in the war zone is limited. It is still difficult to completely dispatch them at once, and small groups of bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, so continued suppression is still needed.</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, came to Beiping from Tianjin at 4:50 p.m. today (18th) due to the reception of the Great Wall passes and the issue of subsidies to consult with He Yingqin and Huang Fu. According to Yu, "The reception of the Great Wall passes is progressing actively these days. Shanhaiguan is scheduled to begin the reception on the 25th. Most of the bandits in eastern Luan have been defeated and are not a cause for concern. After the recovery of Funing, the security team of Dou Xizhe's troops has been concentrated in Changli, and Zhang Xiguang's troops will also withdraw to Changli. Liu Zuozhou's troops under Li Jichun outside the north gate of Funing have been ordered to return to western Luan. More than a thousand bandits who withdrew from Funing have fled to Jielingkou. The Provincial Government has ordered Zhou Yuying's troops to intercept and suppress them. The bandits in eastern Luan will soon be eliminated. Regarding military expenses in North China, Hebei Province's subsidy is 500,000 yuan, but due to the Yellow River flood disaster in three counties in southern Ji this summer, more than 200,000 yuan was used for emergency relief. At the same time, the incorporation of miscellaneous troops such as Li Jichun in eastern Luan also cost 470,000 yuan. These two expenditures have exceeded 500,000 yuan. Recently, after the recovery of Funing, the Provincial Government allocated another 20,000 yuan to handle emergency relief and resettle the refugees. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Government currently has no funds available for subsidies. This time, I plan to explain the financial difficulties to Chairman He and Huang and will return to Tianjin in about two or three days in Beiping."</p>
<p>According to the Jiji Administrative Inspector Special Envoy, "A portion of our security teams has arrived at the major passes of the Great Wall, and local administration has in fact been partially received. There are many small passes, and the security teams cannot be completely dispatched at once. The Japanese army at each pass has not withdrawn because the construction of barracks outside the pass has not been completed. Complete handover will be slightly delayed. In the Shanhaiguan area, the Japanese army has gradually withdrawn, and the Kwantung Army has agreed to hand it over first. I have sent personnel to negotiate the reception. The puppet army of Malan峪 Eastern Tombs is still lingering and has not left. We have now had earnest negotiations with the Japanese side, and it is expected to withdraw soon. The Jiji Special Commissioner's Office will be formally established within days. Miyun is at the intersection of the Dangping and Gubeikou highways. Due to transportation, external events are more complicated. For convenience, it is planned to establish an office there to facilitate contact with all parties." (November 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Commissioner Sugimura Arrives in Guangdong; Pays Visit to Military and Political Authorities Upon Arrival in Guangzhou; Said to be an Inspection of the Lives of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese government dispatched diplomatic commissioner Mr. Sugimura to South China to inspect various ports along the coast and investigate various situations. On the 13th of this month, he arrived in Hong Kong aboard the Japanese ship Diri Maru. That morning, he took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to Guangzhou. On the 13th, Sugimura, accompanied by the Japanese Consul to Guangdong, Koshige, visited the provincial and municipal authorities. He first went to the Direct Government Office and met with the Mayor of Guangzhou, Liu Jiwen, who received him immediately. After a brief discussion, Sugimura took his leave and drove to Meihua Village in Dongshan to visit the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, Chen Jitang, to convey his intentions. He praised the recent progress in construction and the strict military administration in the Southwest, expressing his admiration. During the conversation, he expressed his hope that China and Japan would practice friendship. Chen replied that respecting peace is the nature of the Chinese people. They had a pleasant conversation for about thirty minutes before he excused himself and left. Sugimura then visited the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Lin Yun　, and the Diplomatic Inspector of the Five Provinces, Gan Jiehou. At about 4 p.m., Mayor Liu Jiwen hosted a tea party for Mr. Sugimura at Tuisi Garden in Dongshan, accompanied by the Japanese Consul and several military attaches from the consulate. It did not end until about 5 p.m. That evening, Sugimura stayed at the Victoria Hotel in Shamian. According to Sugimura, he had no special mission in coming to Guangdong this time, but only to inspect the lives of Japanese residents and the state of Japanese commerce in the various ports of South China. As for the case of Korean Park Ui-il's arrest in Guangzhou, the case is not serious, and the Japanese Consul in Guangdong can handle it himself. The impression he gained from this observation was very good. He felt that China's construction had made great progress, and he hoped to strive for progress and reach a state of wealth and strength. His country is very willing to strengthen relations and jointly maintain peace in East Asia. Sugimura stayed in Guangzhou for one day and night, and then took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to Hong Kong at 4:15 p.m. the next day (the 14th), accompanied by a private secretary. On the 15th, he went to Macau from Hong Kong. After staying in Macau for one or two days, he returned to Hong Kong and went to Taiwan, and then returned home to report his mission.

<h3>After Completing the Inspection of Southern Shandong, Han Fuju Returns to Jinan; Inspects Eleven Counties Including Taian and Yanzhou; According to Reports, Progress is Generally Seen in All Areas</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju departed from Jinan on the 3rd of this month to inspect the counties in southern Shandong, inquire about the suffering of the people, and passed through eleven counties including Taian, Yanzhou, Zou County, Teng County, Yi County, Linyi, Fei County, Ju County, Tancheng, Zhucheng, and Anqiu. He traveled a long distance and had no time to rest. This morning, after taking roll call and giving instructions in Anqiu, he arrived at Weixian at noon. Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, came to Weixian from Qingdao to meet him. He invited Han to visit Qingdao, but Han declined and returned to Jinan with Ge. He arrived at 8 p.m. He spent a total of fifteen days inspecting southern Shandong, ending his trip. After a brief rest, a reporter met with Mr. Han and asked about his impressions of the inspection. Han gave a brief talk, comparing the political and judicial affairs of the various counties. The following is a record of the inspection in Anqiu, the return to Jinan, and the conversation, divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection of Anqiu</h3>
<p>Mr. Han arrived in Anqiu last night. Because he had been inspecting and giving speeches along the way, he was extremely tired and rested at the county government that night. This morning (the 17th) at 8 a.m., he conducted separate roll calls and inspections. Advisor Cheng Xixian and Han Duofeng conducted roll calls of the garrison, the public security bureau, the civilian group, and government employees at the drill ground in Xiguan. Counselor Sha Yuepo and Ms. Guan gathered students from various schools at the Education Bureau to give lectures. Counselor Ge Jinzhang checked the accounts of the county government and the public security bureau last night, and today he checked the accounts of the garrison. Mr. Han himself inquired about more than ten cases at the county government and executed a bandit named Bie Taihe. Then, he had lunch and went to the Education Bureau to give a speech to all sectors of society, advising them to cut their hair, unbind their feet, and work hard to suppress bandits and maintain local order. After the speech, he rested briefly and left Anqiu by car at half past noon. He originally planned to go to Fangzi for inspection yesterday, but he changed his mind temporarily to save time and went directly to Weixian from Anqiu. At 1:30 p.m., Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, who had come from Qingdao on the fifth train this morning, arrived first in Weixian at twelve o'clock, and brought two special cars to welcome Han to visit Qingdao. After Han arrived in Weixian, they met, exchanged pleasantries, and Ge said that Mayor Shen (Honglie) had originally planned to come in person to welcome him to Qingdao, but because he was inspecting the Jiaoji railway line back to Qingdao, he asked him to come instead. Han declined and invited Ge to Jinan together. At 1:50 p.m., the special train departed west, only adding coal and water at Zhangdian and Pujiji, and not stopping at any other stations. The train arrived in Jinan at 8:05 p.m.</p>
<h3>Situation Upon Arrival in Jinan</h3>
<p>At 7 p.m., the law enforcement office and the public security bureau dispatched military police to guard inside and outside the station. Around 7:30 p.m., the provincial party, government, and military leaders arrived at the station to greet him. Han's special train arrived at the station at 8:02 p.m. After getting off the train, he exchanged greetings with the greeters and talked to reporters before getting into a car to rest at the provincial government. The greeters also dispersed and returned.</p>
<h3>Mr. Han's Conversation</h3>
<p>When a reporter met with Mr. Han and asked about his impressions of this inspection, he said, "I feel that the countryside is good, so I don't want to live in the city for a long time. I often go to the countryside to inspect and always want to be close to the people, ask about their suffering, and try to alleviate it to fulfill my responsibility. This inspection passed through a dozen counties, but because the road was difficult to travel due to rain in Rizhao and Yishui counties, I was unable to go. I have been to all other counties, stayed in villages and towns more often, and paid attention to visiting and inspecting. In comparison, politics is better in Taian, justice is best in Ju County, and Anqiu is generally good. Progress is generally seen in all counties." (17th)</p>
<h3>Cao Wang Tomb Proved to be an Eastern Han Site; Dong Zuobin Continues to Investigate Lingqiu and Xuecheng; Nine Shandong University Students Participate in the Work</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the excavation of the Cao Wang Tomb in Anshang Village, Teng County, a carved stone with a double-fish pattern was discovered in front of the tomb. According to Dong Zuobin, it is not a Han "basin" but an ordinary Han stone object without much peculiarity. However, this tomb has now been definitively proven to be an Eastern Han site. Whether it is the tomb of Emperor Wu of Wei is still difficult to verify. Liu Xian, a professor at Shandong University, and nine students arrived in Anshang Village on the 11th to assist in the work. After the addition of this new force, it became even more lively. On the 12th, Dong Zuobin assigned the students to work at the Cao Wang Tomb. The remaining four and Liu Xian stayed in Anshang Village. At present, Dong is continuing to investigate the Lingqiu and Xuecheng sites. The reporter went to Teng the day before yesterday, stayed for half a day, and made the following brief record of what he saw:</p>
<h3>Anshang Site</h3>
<p>As of the 16th, excavators had opened 36 pits. Yesterday, several large wooden poles, about several inches in diameter and five or six feet long, were taken out of a round well in the second pit. They were arranged horizontally and vertically at the bottom of the well, with many stones on top. There were about several baskets of tiles every day. It is said that this well is from a later period. When it was and what it was used for is currently being studied. The students of Shandong University carry recording books and walk back and forth beside the pits in the cold wind, carefully observing and recording, which is quite enthusiastic. Professor Liu accompanied Mr. Dong to the area of ​​Lingcheng Village to investigate the old site of Lingqiu. Lingqiu is the place where Qi Zhi, recorded by Mencius, once served as the Prime Minister of Song, about ten miles north of the Anshang site. The near-earth map of the Anshang site is being surveyed and mapped by Qi Yanxu and will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Cao Tomb Stone Chamber</h3>
<p>The work on the Cao Tomb has been opened to fifteen chambers, including ten stone chambers and five that were made into box shapes without chambers. They have all been looted by thieves who traveled from eleven. Among them, broken Ming artifacts and Wuzhu coins were found, all of which can be confirmed as relics of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Mr. Mou Xiangnong, who is in charge of the matter, is currently supervising workers to search for more than ten stone chambers nearby. Four Shandong University students are recording separately and measuring and drawing the structural forms of each stone chamber.</p>
<h3>Xuecheng Investigation</h3>
<p>Dong believes that with the increase in staff and the fact that five or six out of ten of the Anshang and Cao Tombs have been excavated, he plans to go to Zoufeng and other places to investigate the nearby sites to prepare for continued work. Therefore, he handed over the work in Anshang and Cao Tombs to the staff to carry out separately according to the planned plan, and entrusted Professor Liu to guide and supervise them. Dong went to Teng on the 16th and went to Zouxian, Xuecheng, and Lincheng on the 17th to investigate. Liu Weijun, a student from Shandong University, accompanied him. It is expected to return to the work site within five days. (18th)</p>

Subsequently, the procuratorate ordered He Xihu and his friend Zhu Lianxizi and others to be interrogated, but He never appeared. It was not until the evening of the day before yesterday that Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the water patrol team, sent police to arrest He at the Tiansheng Theater outside the South Gate and escort him to the county court. After Shen, the prosecutor, opened the court, He knew nothing about how Wang Aihu died and requested a re-examination of the body. The interrogator approved it, and at 1 pm yesterday, he ordered Gu Dazhong, the head of the district, to appear in court. After a brief interrogation, he immediately led the officials and police, and escorted He Xihu to the coffin site near the Nan Shuixian Temple to re-examine the coffin. It was found that there was a red mark on the back of the deceased's right head, as big as a silkworm pupa, without any gun holes, and there were no bullets in the head. It was determined that she had fallen into the water and died due to injury before her death. After the examination, he ordered the head of the district to re-coffin her and escorted Yuan Xihu back to the court, still under detention.</p>

<h3>Murder Case in Mudu District</h3>
<p>Fei Asi, a villager in Tangxiang Li Village, south of Lion Mountain in Mudu District outside Xumen, 36 years old, did not engage in proper business but was addicted to opium. He had dozens of acres of ancestral firewood and rice fields, which had long been sold and used up. There were still his old mother Fan, his wife Qiu, and his younger brother Hugen in the family. They all hated Asi for not engaging in production and ruining the family property. Recently, Asi was dissatisfied with his younger brother Hugen's failure to provide funds and roared loudly, claiming that he had to sell the furniture. Hugen then secretly discussed with his mother and sister-in-law, and on the night of the 12th of this month, after Asi returned home and fell asleep, they jointly strangled Asi to death with a rope. The next morning, they reported to the Fifth Branch, claiming that he had committed suicide by hanging. On one hand, the local constable Li Songting obtained permission from the court to waive the examination and then coffined the body. Yesterday (19th), the police station of the district reported that someone else had reported that he had been murdered. After investigation, it was found to be true, so Fei Fan, Fei Qiu, Fei Hugen, and the local constable Songting were summoned to the bureau and transferred to the General Bureau to be sent to the court. On the one hand, the court prepared to open the coffin of Fei Asi for examination.</p>

<h3>Bandits Block and Rob, Shot While Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>Sun Genying, from Baitang, Wuyi County, sells ducks for a living. At about 3 pm on the 18th, he received more than 180 yuan for ducks in the city, and then went down to the countryside. When he arrived near Qingshuitan in Mujang Street outside Xiaonanmen, two bandits suddenly came up with weapons to rob him and took away all the hidden ocean that he was carrying. They fled to the back of Mujang Street. When Sun saw the two bandits fleeing, he called for the capture of the thieves. At that time, nearby farmers and others all rose up to pursue them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two bandits fled in different directions. Sun Ronggen and a villager chased a bandit closely, never giving up. At this time, the Second Branch of the Public Security also sent a team to rush to them and surround them on three sides. Because the bandit was unfamiliar with the address, he wanted to hide in the Kofeng section near the Shita. The police and others went inside to search, and the bandit opened fire to resist arrest. The police team returned fire and hit the bandit's arm. He was captured and taken to the station for questioning. He gave his name as Xu Yunhai. Then, he remained silent, pretending to be seriously injured, and was sent to Wujin Hospital for treatment, where the bullet was removed. According to the doctor, the injury was still serious, but there was no danger to his life.</p>

<h3>Opposition to the Ministry's Approval of Shipping on the Anhui Shore</h3>
<p>The Twelve Mile Pier Salt Workers' Professional Union, because the Jinan Seventh Company will move the Huaibei Yutong shareholders, has decided to move the head office to Chengang. In order to maintain their livelihoods, they will send representatives to Yangzhou and Beijing to petition various departments and agencies. Now, because the union is engaged in shipping Huai Salt to Anhui, they have telegraphed the Salt Office and the Ministry of Finance, begging them to order the merchants to stop shipping in order to save lives. Yesterday (17th), the Ministry of Finance issued a reply, roughly stating that this case was previously approved for expediency in order to maintain the livelihoods of the boatmen in Twelve Mile Pier. The 100 tickets for shipping to Anqing were changed to half by wheels and half by sails. However, it is heard that as for the 50 tickets for shipping by wheels, the Huai Salt Transport Envoy has repeatedly telegraphed that the rental of warehouses, tickets, and wheels in Anqing have all been arranged, and it is difficult to stop them. It is necessary to maintain the original plan. When 50 tickets are still somewhat limited, they should not have any impact on the livelihoods of the pier workers. Approval has been given to do so. As for whether to continue to do so in the future, the envoy has also been ordered to go to Anhui and consult with the Anhui Shore Tax Transport Bureau to investigate and negotiate in detail and reply, and then make a decision. You should know and obey, etc.</p>

The sole reason for this launch was foreign policy. Now it is gone. As for what will happen next, nothing has been determined.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yan Came to Shanghai from Fujian Amidst the Fujian Rebellion</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, Jiang Yan, Brigade Commander of the 166th Brigade of the 56th Division stationed in Fujian, made significant contributions in the campaign to suppress Lu Xingbang last year. Last month, the elite troops of the communist bandits Peng Dehuai and others invaded Fujian, and the 19th Route Army suffered heavy losses. The provincial capital of Fuzhou was shaken. The Japanese army, under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, sent warships to station there. Jiang successively recovered Yangkou, Shunchang, Jiangle, Xihe, Jian'ou, Yanping, and other places, the gateway to Fujian, and seized more than 20,000 firearms. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Military Council, specially rewarded him with 50,000 yuan and promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general. Jiang Yan distributed all the 50,000 yuan of the central reward to the officers and soldiers. To avoid being misunderstood under the great reputation, and because there were many rumors in the Fujian Bureau, he had already submitted his resignation last week. Although the authorities did not approve it, Jiang had already taken a boat to Shanghai yesterday. Those who came with him were Secretary Zhu Xingsan and five others. It is heard that the Fujian newspapers were ordered not to publish Jiang's resignation, so no one knew when he left Fujian.</p>

<h3>Yang Dezhao, Representative of Chen Jitang, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Mr. Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Banditry Army of the Southern Route, returned to Guangdong to meet with Chen some time ago on official business. He has now completed his official duties and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1 pm on the Russian Queen of the Changxing Company from Hong Kong. A reporter from the Far East News Agency made a special visit to his residence on Aimeiyuxian Road. According to him, the Southwest's attitude towards the Fujian incident is quite detailed. They are listed as follows:</p>
<h3>What Was Heard About the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>When answering reporters' questions, Mr. Yang first said that he had never heard of the Fujian incident. He only knew about it after reading the newspapers. Until he left the province, the Southwest authorities had not received any official news about the matter. Even if the rumors are true, it is unlikely to become a reality.</p>
<h3>Southwest Attitude</h3>
<p>Then he said that when he was in the province, he had also talked to Mr. Chen Bonan (Jitang), but Mr. Chen, based on his past claims, is currently working hard on suppressing bandits and actively implementing the three-year plan in Guangdong Province. Before they understand the truth, he and the Southwest Committee members do not want to express anything and will take a wait-and-see attitude. At this point, the reporter asked Mr. Yang about the rumors that Fujian would do something in Guangdong. He replied that it was probably not credible. If it were to happen, it would be handled well.</p>
<h3>Hu and Li in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>A reporter inquired again about whether Mr. Hu Hanmin and Mr. Li Jishen would go to Fujian to participate [in events there]. The response was that Mr. Hu is currently still in Hong Kong, and the rumors of a secret trip to Fujian are absolutely untrue. He, Mr. Li Jishen, and other Guangdong-based Central Committee members are all taking a very stable approach. During this period of deliberation, they definitely will not be involved in participating in events in Fujian.</p>
<h3>Heading to the Capital</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang finally told the reporter that the situation in the suppression of bandits in the Southern Route could be summarized in the words "extremely good." However, detailed information cannot be disclosed because of orders from the Military Affairs Commission. He will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days before heading to the capital. This is because his work requires him to be stationed in the capital regularly. As for whether he will go to Jiangxi, that will be decided after arriving in the capital and receiving a telegram from Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Leader Qin Runqing Denies One Million Yuan Loan - 1933 Customs Treasury Bonds as Collateral - Already Fully Repaid in Early October of This Year</h3>
<p>Qin Runqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Money Trade Association, issued a statement to the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, saying that former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, in early October of this year, used five million yuan of 1933 Customs Treasury Bonds as collateral for a loan of two and a half million yuan from the money industry. The funds have long been returned to the Ministry of Finance, and the treasury bonds have also been collected from the Money Trade Joint Reserve by the Central Bank and distributed to various money houses. The allocation method was determined based on the financial strength of each member money house. The report that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has established a new loan of one million yuan with the money industry, using 1933 Customs Treasury Bonds as collateral, with 65 money houses each contributing 10,000 yuan and the remaining 350,000 yuan being advanced by the Joint Reserve, is completely untrue. There are 67 member money houses, and the extraordinary meeting on the 16th of this month did not make a decision on the above method. As for whether the Ministry of Finance needs to use 1933 Customs Treasury Bonds as collateral to the money industry again, he is unaware.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Factories Held Joint Meeting Yesterday - 19 Representatives from Various Factories Attended - Important Proposals Were Resolved</h3>
<p>Recently, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk factory industry has been facing near-total collapse due to the dumping of foreign silk in China. The silk remaining in the factories' warehouses amounts to nearly ten thousand dan. Manufacturers are on the verge of bankruptcy. In view of this situation, the industry held its first joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the association's location on North Shanxi Road to discuss overall relief measures.

Chu Huiseng was elected as chairman.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported, stating briefly that since the opening of the sea ban, the sales of Chinese silk had been extraordinarily prosperous. Twenty years ago, it was still second to none. Recently, Japan has used economic aggression to drastically lower silk prices and dump them in Europe and the United States, causing tremendous damage to China's silk industry, which is now on the verge of bankruptcy. Relief must be sought. This joint meeting of Jiangsu and Zhejiang representatives has been convened to jointly discuss relief measures to maintain [the industry]. He hopes that all representatives will contribute their opinions as much as possible to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of Various Proposals</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, the discussion of the proposals began: (1) Proposal to request the government to promptly implement unified control, dredge stockpiled silk, and stabilize market prices. Resolved: Amended and passed. (2) Proposal to request the government to order national banks to accept stockpiled silk as collateral at low interest rates before the establishment of the Unified Committee. Resolved: Passed.

<h3>Sixth Promoters' Meeting of the National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company - Prince Ya of Qinghai's Speech Moved the Entire Audience - Date of Founding Meeting Set for the 20th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company is a great new organization to connect currency across all provinces and earnestly plan for unified control of production and consumption. The number of governors and enthusiastic individuals from various provinces who have signed up to join has reached fifteen. The sixth promoters' meeting was convened at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 12:00 noon on the 18th by preparatory directors Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, and others. Those who attended included Xu Shiying, Zhu Ziqiao, Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Wu Tiecheng, Hu Zongduo, Cai Wuji, Xu Xinliu, Fang Jiaobo,  Chunsheng, Xu Kecheng, Xu Jigong, Ren Jinping, Wang Jian, and Prince Ya Qingzhai of Qinghai, and over a hundred others. First, Lin Kanghou reported on the recent progress of the preparation and elaborated on the purpose of convening the meeting, briefly stating: (1) Since the company began its preparation, the enthusiastic participation and support from all provinces has reached fifteen, making it urgent to determine the date of the founding meeting in order to generate directors and supervisors, and to invite leaders and experts from various provinces and industries to organize various committees to be responsible for carrying out plans. (2) All promoters and supporters who have already signed up to subscribe for shares are expected to send the share payment to the bank or money house handling the collection of share payments within the shortest possible time. (3) The company's operating principles will be based entirely on a spirit of mutual assistance to promote domestic goods, and will never compete with others for profit. After the company is established, it will assist various provinces in establishing local branches in order to expand the domestic goods business, so that industrial production and workers' lives can both benefit. Everything must proceed from small to large, from near to far, so that gradual results can be achieved. Next, Wu Zhihao reported, briefly stating: (1) The company will concentrate talent, unite economies, and develop promotional forces to jointly seek mutual assistance, gathering products from various factories on one hand and assisting various provinces and regions in establishing chain stores and organizing domestic goods distribution centers on the other, in order to plan for large-scale sales and seek financial adjustments. (2) After the company is established, personnel will be dispatched to various provinces to contact local leaders and organize local production and sales companies, not only to transport Shanghai products to various provinces, but also to transport thick materials and local specialties from various provinces to Shanghai for application, so that inland products will not be abandoned and the livelihoods of inland people will not be exhausted. (3) Prince Ya Qingzhai of Qinghai has expressed great sympathy for the company, and his plan to develop Qinghai is particularly consistent with the meaning of the company's production and sales cooperation. He is very willing to join the company as a promoter, and will immediately start planning to change the name of the original Qinghai Trading Company and prepare to establish the Qinghai National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company. He is also willing to unconditionally delineate one hundred square li of his own land as a pilot area for the development of Qinghai. Prince Ya was a student in Japan, and his patriotic ideas are extremely enthusiastic. Next, Ya Qingzhai, Song Yuanyuan, Zhu Ziqiao, Hua Weifeng, and others spoke in succession. Prince Ya's speech was particularly moving to the entire audience. Finally, it was resolved that December 20th would be the date for convening the founding meeting. It was not until about 3:00 PM that the adjournment was announced. The speech of Prince Ya is recorded below, and it is hoped that the people of the country will pay close attention to it, so as not to fail the enthusiasm of the border compatriots.</p>
<p>Prince Ya Qingzhai said in his speech, "I am a Mongolian, but I have studied in Japan, but I feel that my knowledge is lacking. It is an honor for me to attend today's grand meeting in Shanghai. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have fallen one after another, and the people and land have been trampled upon, causing great suffering. However, Russia has the same ambition for Xinjiang, and Britain has the same ambition for Tibet. If Qinghai does not unite with enthusiastic compatriots of the five races today, and do its best to develop and build strength in order to defend itself, the future danger is difficult to predict. Since I met with Mr. Wu Zhihao, I have learned in detail that the plan adopted by the production and sales company is indeed a good strategy for saving the country, and Mr. Ren Jinping's proposal to gather the strength of the two provinces and rise up to learn from Germany, Italy, and Turkey is particularly moving. Currently, the area of Qinghai is as large as the four provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and the soil is fertile. Not only are the forests like clouds and the rivers crisscrossing, but the trial planting of cotton, beans, and wheat has achieved excellent results. There are also undeveloped gold mines, and the climate is not as cold as Heilongjiang, but is similar to Shanxi and Shandong. Although the people are a mix of five races, they are all harmonious and patriotic. If more patriotic people can be gathered to go to the border and educate the people of Qinghai, it will be enough to develop a great national strength. Therefore, I have not hesitated to join as a promoter, and I hope that all of you will jointly assist in the development of Qinghai. I have already unconditionally delineated one hundred square li of fertile land as a pilot area for the development of Qinghai, and I am willing to do my best to protect it."</p>
<h3>Wang Jialie's Attitude in Guizhou Amidst the Southwest Political Change</h3>
<p>The Southwest political change centered on Chen Mingshu of Fujian was rumored to be very strong the previous week. Although it has slowed down somewhat now, the attempt to establish independence has not been abandoned. It was previously reported that Chen Mingshu claimed to be the commander of the Five Province Allied Army, listing Fujian, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Jiangxi. Separately, the Jiang and Cai provinces were old subordinates of Chen, and Li and Bai in Guangxi were inherently ambitious and would inevitably have a tacit understanding with Fujian. As for Jiangxi, it was entirely a false claim. Although Yunnan and Guizhou are located on the periphery, their attitude is quite noteworthy. Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed people from Guizhou in Shanghai who were related to provincial politics, and learned about Guizhou's relationship with the Southwest and its recent situation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Wang Originally Leaning towards Gui</h3>
<p>Wang Jialie, chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, and You Guocai, commander of the Third Division, have often been at odds, and there have been several civil wars. You sought external support from Yunnan. Therefore, when the Guizhou war broke out again, Long Yun sent troops to help You. As for Wang Jialie, due to geographical relations, he was closer to Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng of Guangxi. Therefore, during the Guizhou war, Li Zongren telegraphed Long Yun, urging him to mediate, even saying that if mediation was ineffective and Yunnan troops entered Guizhou, then the Fourth Group Army would also send troops to Guizhou, to threaten and restrain him, and the Wang-You war would stop. Therefore, in terms of the relationship in the past, Wang Jialie originally leaned towards Guangxi.</p>
<h3>Supporting the Central Government</h3>
<p>Recently, the Southwest has been brewing a political change under the pretext of diplomatic issues. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others have long had a tacit understanding with Chen Mingshu. As for Wang Jialie of Guizhou, it was generally expected that he would follow the lead of Li and Bai. However, in fact, Wang has always supported the central government and is unwilling to echo this kind of action that betrays the central government and establishes independence. Due to geographical relations, he cannot differ with the Southwest (especially Guangxi), so he has always remained uncommitted, in order to avoid offending powerful neighbors.</p>
<h3>Transforming Guizhou Politics</h3>
<p>However, the Guangxi faction is quite displeased with this. According to telegrams received the previous day, "Zhang Pengnian, advisor to the Fourth Group Army," has been active in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places recently, vigorously advocating the authorities in the Southwest to transform Guizhou politics. Currently, Zhang left Guangzhou for Nanning at the end of last month and had contact with Li (Zongren), Bai (Chongxi), and Huang (Xuchu) of Guangxi. After staying in Nanning for several days, he set off for Yunnan to contact Long Yun and You Guocai and others. From this, it can be seen that the Guangxi faction's attitude towards Wang of Guizhou is obviously dissatisfied.</p>
<h3>Hope for Resolution of the Electricity Strike - Chinese Directors Agreed on a Plan - Labor Expressed Acceptance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company workers' strike has been ongoing for 52 days. Since Feixindun, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, invited City Councilor Du Yuesheng to formally mediate with the company, after three consultations, a decision has largely been reached. However, there are still some issues that need to be carefully discussed. Therefore, Du, along with Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Yu Qiaqing, as well as Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Ren Jinping, and Lu Jingshi of the City Party Headquarters, and Shi Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, consulted again yesterday at noon. A concrete decision has been made on the resolution plan, and a final consultation will be held with the company today. However, the content of the plan has not yet been released. The Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union also convened a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Fourth District Water and Electricity Labor Union on Guohuo Road in Nanshi. More than 1,000 workers from both old and new plants attended. Lu Jingshi of the City Party Headquarters and Zhu Xuejie of the General Labor Union attended to provide guidance. Xu Hongsheng, Yang Zhaogen, and Zhu Haolin were elected as chairmen. After the report, it was resolved to accept the resolution plan decided by Mr. Fei and Mr. Du and wait for a resolution. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Dye Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning - Dye Shops Opened for Dyeing Customer Goods - Liquor Fee Guarantee Method - Both Parties Consulted to Resolve</h3>
<p>Various dye shops for silk fabrics and cotton cloths in this city were in a state of complete rejection of dyeing work, which was triggered by silk shops deducting dyeing prices and causing problems with the liquor fees that workers and customers should share. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation and established three methods, it was resolved. A solution was also negotiated and decided regarding the liquor fee guarantee method. Each dye shop started to resume dyeing goods yesterday morning. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Liquor Fee Guarantee Method</h3>
<p>After the workers of various dye shops for silk fabrics and cotton cloths automatically rejected dyeing customer goods, the Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that the dispute would be prolonged, convened camp funding on the 16th of this month to conduct mediation, established three methods, and announced a resolution. However, the workers' side feared that the capital side had already depreciated dyeing prices for customers, and even if it was restored, the workers' liquor fee issue could not be fully paid. Therefore, a representative meeting was convened to discuss and postpone the resumption of dyeing, and Wei Yi, Wu Jinsheng, and Liu Jintai, the dye industry labor union representative, were pushed to negotiate with the same industry association. As a result, the liquor fee would still be paid by the dye shop and guaranteed by the silk satin industry association.</p>
<h3>Received Dyeing Customer Goods Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the liquor fee guarantee issue was resolved, the dye industry labor union instructed the silk fabric office and the cotton cloth office to inform all workers to resume work uniformly. The same industry association of the dyeing industry also separately notified each dye shop to resume dyeing customer goods as usual. Therefore, yesterday morning, 72 dye shops such as Lao Zhenghe, Qian Da, and Qian Yuan in this city all started to receive dyeing customer goods uniformly.</p>
<h3>Results of Yesterday's Consultation between Labor and Management in the Fashion Industry - Seven Companies Including Huamei Have Resolved and Resumed Work - Stores Such as Huaxin Continue to Strike</h3>
<p>Workers in the fashion industry in this city, because the capital side still cut wages after the autumn market opened, suddenly announced a strike the previous day and petitioned party and government agencies to mediate. Yesterday, seven fashion stores including Huamei and seven foremen of external workshops, including Chen Xinshi, directly signed a settlement agreement with the garment industry labor union and announced a resolution. However, stores such as Huaxin, because the capital side's attitude was persistent, continued to strike. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Direct Consultation between Labor and Management</h3>
<p>Since the workers suddenly announced a strike the previous morning, as it happened to be the beginning of the autumn season, which is the prosperous period of business throughout the year, each capital side foreman successively consulted directly with the garment labor union from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM yesterday and signed a settlement agreement, including Huamei, Xinhua, Dahua, Tongfengyong, Lihua, Limei, Meida, and other seven stores, and the external workshops included Chen Xinshi, Zhu Jinzhang, Zhou Quanqing, Yu Xianfang, Shi Yanshou, He Liansheng, Gu Caigen, and other seven foremen. Because workers in the fashion stores and external workshops that had resolved received a notice from the labor union, they all worked as usual.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Signed Agreement</h3>
<p>A. The part signed by the capital side and the labor union, the garment industry labor-management agreement: Because the labor side suffers from a painful life and cannot maintain it, the labor tide dispute arose. Because the capital side pities the suffering of the workers, they are willing to increase the original wages layer by layer, four corners per piece, and from the date of the contract, all will be implemented according to the following wages. The wages set are as follows: (1) The foreman for skirt hem turning leather will receive three yuan in wages. (2) Straight hem two yuan and four corners. (3) Eggplant armor two yuan and two corners. (4) Raincoat one yuan. (5) Cape two yuan. (Note) All external work will be charged an additional two corners for electricity costs per piece. B. The part signed by the external workshop foreman and the garment labor union: (1) Skirt hem two yuan and six corners. (2) Straight hem two yuan. (4) Eggplant armor one yuan and eight corners. (4) Raincoat six corners. (5) Cape one yuan and five corners. (6) Turning leather coat two yuan and six corners.</p>
<h3>Huaxin and Others Still on Strike</h3>
<p>Due to the persistent attitude of the capital side, the workers of Huaxin and Daxin on Zhejiang Road, Jintai Xiang, Jinxin, and Xinfeng on Fuzhou Road, and Yu Sanjiu, Yuan Xingyou, and others in the external workshops are still continuing to strike. The labor union convened a temporary representative meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday, with more than 80 people attending. Chairman Zhang Liangcai resolved the following proposals: (1) In addition to supplementing the workers' wages according to the original price, add four corners. (2) The agreement signed directly between the capital side foreman and the labor union will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing. (3) Due to the strong attitude of the stores such as Huaxin and the foremen such as Yu Sanjiu, it was decided to continue the strike.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Truth by the Association</h3>
<p>After the same industry association of the Western-style clothing industry in this city received a public letter from the garment labor union on the 14th of this month, it convened an executive committee. In addition to sending representatives to investigate the truth, it also replied to the labor union, advising the workers to wait quietly for a resolution. The original letter is recorded below: (Reply directly) We received your letter on the 14th of this month, in which it was stated, "According to the statement of the members of this association, after the resumption of business this autumn, stores such as Huaxin, Yixin, Huali, Huamei, and Dahua on Fourth Malu have again reduced wages (deducting about two corners to six corners per piece), which is a violation of the labor-management reconciliation record of the Social Affairs Bureau on April 7th of this year. We respectfully request that you take measures to provide relief," etc. Based on this, this association has sent personnel to investigate and found that the matter is not false. We have specifically sent this letter to your association, requesting that you restrain your members to uphold fairness and quickly supplement the reduced wages (before the 15th of this month), otherwise, we fear that the workers will become激变, and it will not be beneficial. Therefore, we have specifically requested your association to investigate and comply with this order. We are urgently awaiting your reply, etc. After the association submitted it to the 51st executive committee for discussion, it was resolved, "Regarding whether the truth of the case is factual, a thorough investigation will be conducted before a decision is made," etc. We are afraid that your association is urgently awaiting a reply, so we are replying in advance, hoping that you will investigate and comply.</p>

<h3>City General Labor Union Sent Personnel to Mediate the Tianzhang Paper Mill Strike - And Ordered Workers to Resume Work First</h3>
<p>Workers at the Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, expressed dissatisfaction due to the capital side's violation of the resolution decided by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 16th, delaying the payment of wages. After the Fifth District Paper Industry Labor Union sent personnel to persuade them without success, a strike occurred. The City General Labor Union yesterday specifically ordered the workers to resume work first and sent personnel to mediate. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order to Resume Work: The City General Labor Union instructed the Fifth District Paper Industry Labor Union yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of compliance, according to the report submitted by the association, the capital side has broken its promise and failed to fulfill the promises made during the mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau, such as paying wages on time. The workers are unwilling to accept the reconciliation record, and the labor union's persuasion has been ineffective. Please provide assistance," etc. Based on this, after investigating the reconciliation method, since it has been decided that the workers should be mindful of the national crisis period, labor and management should cooperate to jointly save the situation, and it is inappropriate to strike rashly. The association, in addition to sending personnel to persuade the factory to pay wages immediately, specifically orders the association to instruct all workers to endure the pain and maintain the situation, and not to cause trouble intentionally, so as not to cause inconvenience. You must comply with this order."</p>
<p>Conducting Mediation: In addition to ordering the resumption of work, the City General Labor Union also sent Wan Banghe, a staff member of the association, to persuade and conduct mediation as appropriate. Initially, both sides persisted in their positions. After repeated persuasion, a compromise plan was proposed without undermining the principle of the Social Affairs Bureau's resolution. The workers' side expressed their willingness to compromise and accept, and the capital side also agreed to submit it to the board of directors for discussion. Therefore, the strike is expected to be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Li Du Telegraphed the Central Government to Maintain the Livelihood Expenses of the Old Troops Remaining in Jilin - More Than One Hundred Soldiers Retired from Russia Will Be Repatriated</h3>
<p>Liu Piguang, secretary of General Li Du, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to a reporter from Yu Min Yan News Agency, General Li's troops remaining in Jilin still number tens of thousands. Now, a telegram has been received from the consulate in Boli reporting that there are now more than one hundred soldiers from Li's troops and thirteen family members of Chen Zongdai, the acting commander-in-chief, who have retreated into the Russian territory of Yima. According to a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Executive Yuan has prepared funds for repatriation. After reporting to General Li, the General telegraphed the Central Government that there are still more than 40,000 troops stationed in Jilin province. If the government does not provide support, they will be forced to retreat to Russia entirely, which would only increase the government's burden. Previously, when the troops of Ma, Su, Li, Wang, and others retreated to Russia, they only numbered a thousand, but the maintenance costs and travel expenses paid to the Soviet Russian government had already consumed 600,000 US dollars. It would be better to provide relief first, which could be a potential force for recovering lost territory. General Li recently telegraphed the Central Government requesting</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan's Representative Xiao Zhenying Returned North Last Night - Consultation with Kong on Financial Matters Has Already Yielded a Solution - Song Zheyuan Is Currently Staying in Tianjin to Recover from Lower Back Pain</h3>
<p>Xiao Zhenying, member of the Beiping Military Sub-council and member of the Political Affairs Consolidation Committee, who was dispatched this time to the south as a representative of Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, met with Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, in Beijing to report on the situation of the Chahar Provincial Government and transferred to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions. After completing his tasks, Mr. Xiao took a boat to leave Jiangxi and arrived in Shanghai the previous morning. He immediately went to see Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to discuss the financial situation of Chahar Province. General Li Du Mr. Xiao is also from Jilin and is very enthusiastic about resisting Japan. Yesterday afternoon, he specially visited Mr. Xiao to discuss for a long time. Xiao had already taken the night express train to Beijing last night to return to Chahar. Only Deputy Officer Wang accompanied him. A reporter from Yu Min Yan News Agency visited Mr. Xiao at the China Hotel. According to the conversation, the financial situation in Chahar Province is extremely difficult. Since the peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation, a large sum of money is needed to handle the aftermath. Currently, the 29th Army and the troops of Tang Yulin and Liu Guitang stationed in Chahar Province number more than 50,000. It is already late November, and they have only received five months of military pay. Soldiers' uniforms also cannot be replenished. This time, he went south to meet with Wang and Chiang to report in detail. After meeting with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi in Shanghai, a solution has already been discussed. He should return to the north to report. Chairman Song is currently staying in Tianjin to recover from severe lower back pain, which has been going on for more than ten days. Chairman Song's lower back pain was caused by a train collision on the way to Nankou in 1926. It has not healed for many years. This time, he worked day and night to handle the aftermath of the Chahar situation, which aggravated his lower back pain. He needs to rest for a long time. Chahar Province is as stable as usual. The issue of Inner Mongolia's autonomy has also been resolved.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan, Chu Minyi, and Liu Weichi took a car out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Longhai Railway's Water-Land Intermodal Transport to Commence Today; Tonghua Steamer Sailed from Shanghai to Laoyao Yesterday; Privately-Owned Steamers Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will undertake the Longhai Railway's water-land intermodal transport, commencing today. Yesterday afternoon, the Tonghua steamer was dispatched to the temporary intermodal transport wharf in Laoyao, Haizhou, to load intermodal transport cargo. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Commencement of Intermodal Transport</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer, acting on orders, departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday for the temporary wharf in Laoyao, Haizhou, to load intermodal transport cargo. It is scheduled to arrive in Haizhou tomorrow evening, the 22nd, and return from Laoyao to Shanghai on the 24th. As for the two barges of the Kang Zheng Ji Towing &amp; Barging Company, which are contracted to handle the barging of intermodal transport cargo at Laoyao, they were originally scheduled to be towed to Laoyao by the Tonghua, but this was temporarily cancelled due to the shallow waters of Haizhou. Kang Zheng Ji telegraphed its Laoyao office last night to find a way to temporarily rent barges from Dapu to handle the intermodal transport cargo, in order to avoid delays, and at the same time to find a way to tow the two barges to Laoyao.</p>
<h3>Business as Usual for Private Companies</h3>
<p>Since the Longhai Railway Administration built the temporary wharf at Sun Yat-sen Station in Laoyao, it has decided that all intermodal transport cargo will be transported to Laoyao for transshipment, while all non-intermodal transport cargo will still be transported to Dapu for transshipment. Therefore, after the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company implements intermodal transport, the various steamers of the privately-owned Dazhen and Hezhong Steamship Companies will continue to operate and load cargo as usual. At the same time, they are conducting research on freight rates in order to compensate for any losses.</p>
<h3>Cargo Congestion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water-Land Intermodal Transport Office of the Longhai Railway Administration received a telegram from the General Bureau stating that there are already over 3,000 tons of intermodal transport cargo stored in the warehouses at the temporary wharf in Laoyao, which is severely congested. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer, which is loading approximately 1,000 tons of cargo, is expected to return fully loaded this time. The Shipping Department has decided to dispatch another steamer to load intermodal transport cargo in order to avoid obstructing cargo transport. In addition, the warehouses at the Dapu wharf are also quite full.</p>
<h3>The Railway Ministry Orders Rectification of Shanghai-Beiping Intermodal Transport Service; Due to the North-South Transport Importance of This Train Service, All Shortcomings Should Be Vigorously Rectified</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received an order yesterday from the Ministry of Railways stating, "Upon investigation of the Shanghai-Beiping intermodal transport train service, which is vital, accuracy is required, and order in the carriages should be especially maintained, to avoid empty seats and insufficient accommodation. It has been found that this train service is often delayed on this route. Furthermore, it has been found that first-class compartments are sometimes locked with unoccupied seats, preventing other passengers from entering, resulting in other passengers either having to share seats or having no seats at all. In addition, second-class short-distance passengers are using the excuse of ordering tea and refreshments to ride in the dining car, effectively purchasing second-class tickets and riding in first-class carriages, which is clearly taking advantage. Moreover, as the weather is getting colder, the food served on the train is often not hot enough, which is unhygienic and sometimes leads to disputes, causing criticism. The ferry crossing takes too long and should be expedited. There appear to be too few porters at the south bank to properly distribute luggage. More porters should be added to ensure efficiency. All of these issues should be vigorously rectified to facilitate passenger travel. In addition to separate orders, you are hereby instructed to comply and report back as required. This order."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Promulgates New Regulations for Ship Measurement and Inspection; Promulgated on October 28th of This Year; The Bureau of Navigation Has Ordered Its Affiliates to Comply</h3>
<p>The regulations for ship measurement and ship inspection were promulgated and implemented in October of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. Now, the Ministry of Communications believes that since the implementation of these regulations, there are many areas that need to be supplemented or revised. After careful review and separate modifications, they have been promulgated again by ministerial order. The Shanghai Bureau of Navigation received these revised regulations yesterday and immediately ordered its affiliates to comply.</p>
<h3>Outline of the Regulations</h3>
<p>According to recent inquiries by the reporter of the Shenshi News Agency, the ship measurement regulations are divided into seven chapters with a total of thirty-two articles, with very few changes from the original regulations. The first chapter is general rules, the second to sixth chapters cover application procedures, measurement procedures, tonnage calculation, measurement documents, measurement fees, etc., and the seventh chapter is supplementary provisions. The ship inspection regulations are divided into eleven chapters with a total of sixty-six articles, with many changes and expansions in content. The first chapter is general rules, the second to tenth chapters cover inspection types, application procedures, inspection procedures, inspection documents, route designation, passenger capacity, steam pressure limits, navigation periods, inspection fees, etc., and the eleventh chapter is supplementary provisions.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Order</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Navigation received Ministry of Communications Order No. 5825 yesterday, stating, "Upon investigation of the ship measurement regulations and ship inspection regulations, which have now been revised by the Ministry and promulgated in Ministry Order No. 385 on October 28th of this year, regarding temporary ship inspections, temporary inspection forms should be issued, as amended in Article 26 of the ship inspection regulations. All temporary ship inspection certificates issued under Ministry of Communications Order No. 3503 of October 21st of the 20th year of the Republic [1931] should be abolished. In addition to separate orders, the regulations are hereby issued to the Bureau for compliance by its affiliates. This order."</p>

As this matter concerns the interests of each factory, we urge you to attend and participate in the discussion on time."</p>
<h3>He Jian and Others Initiate the Qiusheng Society; In Memory of Female Hero Qiu Jin</h3>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Education, and Yang Jie, former President of the Army University, along with twenty others, initiated the organization of the Qiusheng Society in memory of the late heroine Qiu Jin, whose talent astonished the world, whose integrity was extraordinary, who bravely embraced martyrdom, and who regarded death as returning home.

<h3>Red Swastika Society's Disaster Relief Investigator from Western Anhui Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society previously sent a special investigator, Wang Daoyuan, to the three counties of Fuyang, Yingcheng, and Taihe in western Anhui to investigate bandit disasters. The investigator repeatedly reported on the disaster situation, which has been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, the investigator returned to Shanghai and reported the results of the household survey and the income and expenditure of relief funds to the Swastika General Office and the Jisheng Society. The original report is as follows: "Regarding the completion of disaster relief and reimbursement, I, Yuan, was dispatched to carry out disaster relief for the bandit disasters in Fuyang, Yingcheng, and Taihe in western Anhui. I departed on August 21st of this year and arrived in Zhengyang on the 3rd. Due to inconvenience in remitting funds, it was delayed until September before I was able to take the funds to Yingcheng to work. On the 7th, the bandit flames flared up again. At that time, I was investigating and distributing aid to disaster-stricken households in Nanzhao Village and four surrounding villages. Before the procedures were completed, rumors spread like wildfire in the village, and the people had already fled. I had no choice but to return to Yingcheng by boat and stay for two days before taking a car to Fuyang. I investigated and distributed aid in Fuyang for eight days. The city gates of the county were closed all day long due to the tight bandit situation, making entry and exit difficult. Then, I took a car to Taihe, investigated and distributed aid for ten days, and concluded the work. I returned to Fuyang to conduct supplementary investigations in the northwest districts for half a month. After completing the work, I returned to Yingshang, which was already the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. It rained continuously and I couldn't go out. Five days later, when the weather cleared, I went to the Nanzhao Village Runhe Village area to investigate the remaining disaster-stricken households. I worked for one day before the autumn rains came again. I worked tirelessly for six days and completed the work. Overall, the disaster situation in the three counties was most severe in Taihe's Jiuxian Village, Jihui, Wanghui, and other places. Yingcheng's Nanzhao Village and Shibali, Fuyang's Sihui Village and Cihe, Datianshi Village, and other places were also extremely severe. In other villages, the autumn grain had already been harvested, and there was no shortage of rent grain. However, many houses were burned. This investigation and distribution was divided into five grades. Those who suffered from both fire and loss of life were considered extremely severe. Those who lost major members of the family were considered extremely severe. Those who were burned and had no means of support were considered especially severe. Those whose houses were not completely burned but were looted too much were considered secondarily severe. Those who were burned but still had an autumn harvest were considered relatively light. After more than forty days, I actually investigated more than 3,000 disaster-stricken households with a total of 15,439 people, large and small. With the relief funds of 6,000 yuan remitted by the Swastika General Office and the Jisheng Society in two installments, an average of three yuan could be distributed to each household, and each person could receive a little over three jiao eight fen. However, the disaster situation varied, so it was necessary to conduct a thorough household survey to ensure that the funds were used effectively. Fortunately, the Fuyang and Yingcheng Swastika Societies and the Taihe Charity Committee provided public and enthusiastic support, so even though the funds were meager, they had a significant impact. However, the temporary relief of the parched fish is only a short-term solution, and the unrest among the bandits remains a concern. In addition, winter has arrived, and the cold wind is becoming more severe. There are many people without clothes and blankets. I urge various groups to plan for an ample supply of cotton clothing to alleviate the suffering of the survivors and prevent them from freezing to death. This would be a truly immeasurable act of merit. All of the above is a report on the disaster relief situation in the three counties of Pingyuan, Yingcheng, and Taihe. The expenses incurred in this investigation and distribution, except for those borne by the Fuyang and Yingcheng Swastika Societies and the Taihe Charity Committee, were all paid by the Swastika General Office, and no relief funds were misappropriated. This is stated together."</p>
<h3>Records of the Jisheng Society's Soup Kitchens in Beiping</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has been operating soup kitchens in Beiping every winter for the past eight years. This year, the Society received letters from Zhou Jingfu and She Guisheng of Beiping, stating that there are even more poor people this year than in previous years. Due to the battles along the Great Wall and the bandit disasters in eastern Hebei, many displaced people from various regions have gathered in Beiping. In addition, due to the impact of the war, the commercial market has become increasingly depressed, and many prosperous families have moved elsewhere. The unemployed and impoverished people are everywhere. In this cold weather, the poor have no clothes or food and can only sit and wait for death. This situation is unbearable to witness and cannot be described in words. They hoped that the Society would continue to operate the soup kitchens to provide relief. It is reported that the Society plans to change the two soup kitchens outside the North Chaoyangmen and Baiyi Temple to rice distribution this year, which will require approximately 15,000 yuan in relief funds. In addition to the 1,000 yuan donated by Mrs. Bao for the Chaoyangmen, and the 2,000 yuan donated by a certain gentleman for the Baiyi Temple, there is a significant shortage of funds, causing hesitation and preventing the commencement of the work. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will consider the plight of their compatriots in Beiping, who are suffering in the ice and snow, and transfer some of their entertainment funds to disaster relief in order to help them.</p>
<h3>The Postal Savings Bureau Is Ordered to Handle Communications for Northeast Depositors as Appropriate; Limited to Personal Finances; Not Involving Administrative Matters</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after the fall of the three northeastern provinces, the Ministry of Communications ordered the cessation of various postal services in the area. The postal savings deposits in the provinces were also liquidated and returned. Recently, the Ministry of Communications received a report from the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances, stating that it had received a joint petition from depositors in the provinces requesting to send their old savings passbooks to the Savings Bureau in exchange for new ones. The Ministry submitted a special report to the Ministry for instructions. The Ministry of Communications believed that although this method was inconsistent with the original regulations, it was not appropriate to refuse it in consideration of the people of the Northeast. Regarding the communication methods for these depositors, it should be limited to personal financial matters and should not involve administrative matters. However, if individual communication with depositors is necessary, direct replies can be made. The Ministry immediately ordered the Postal Savings Bureau to review and handle these communication methods as appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Expands Coastal Radio Stations; Installs the Latest Type of Fobo Radio Transmitter; Can Communicate with Aircraft and Ships Worldwide</h3>
<p>The Wusong coastal radio station was destroyed by enemy artillery fire during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. All of its equipment was moved to Shanghai, fortunately without loss, and it was renamed the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station. Now, the Ministry of Communications believes that Shanghai is a commercial port and coastal radio stations are important. Therefore, the Ministry is expanding the radio station, establishing a transmitting station in Fenglinqiao and a receiving station in Hongqiao. The general office is located at No. 330 Sassoon Building, Renji Road, with the general receiving and transmitting office attached. Another receiving and transmitting office is also located on Edward Road. The station is equipped with three of the latest type of Fobo radio transmitters, with both long and short waves, capable of communicating directly with aircraft and ships worldwide. The station's engineer is Situ Shangyi, the chief of communications is Ge Chenglu, and the foreman is Chen Zhaorong, all of whom have rich experience and excellent technical skills in machinery and communications. After the expansion, the station is larger and more perfectly organized than before, and it can be considered the only coastal radio station of its kind in East Asia.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Public Bus Company Held Its Fifth Anniversary Celebration Yesterday; Heavy Losses Due to the Shanghai Incident, Difficult Recovery; Actively Cooperating in Municipal Traffic</h3>
<p>The Zhabei China Merchants Public Bus Company has been established for over five years. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the company bore the brunt and suffered heavy losses. After the ceasefire, the company had only three buses left. With the hard work of the company's general manager, Huang Zhongwen, and the efforts of all the staff, the company struggled to recover. Over the past year, the company expanded its share capital to 200,000 yuan, gradually restoring its original state. Yesterday was the company's fifth anniversary. The company's colleagues deeply understood the difficulty of recovery and held a grand fifth anniversary celebration at the Central Auditorium on North Sichuan Road to commemorate the occasion. In addition to inviting representatives from party and government agencies to provide guidance, guests from all walks of life were invited to attend and observe, and there were grand performances to add to the festivities. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Participating Representatives</h3>
<p>The following representatives attended the grand ceremony yesterday: Yuan Boyang, representative of the Ministry of Railways; He Rang, representative of the Municipal Government; Zhou Lianze, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Sun Jiaqian, representative of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau; Yu Fuji, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau; Li Mengnan, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Zhu Kaichou, of the Shanghai-Taicang Company; Bai Tianyi, of the Shanghai-Songjiang Company; Quan Renzhong, of the Automobile Workers' Union of the Sixth District; and representatives from various organizations such as the Civil Society Branch and the Chuanbao Business Federation, totaling over fifty people.</p>
<h3>Order of the Meeting</h3>
<p>Chairman Shi Tifen, Master of Ceremonies Fan Yifeng, Recorders Xu Zaikang and Hang Xianjiu. After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and the company's general manager, Huang Zhongwen, reported on the company's business situation (speech listed later). Next, representatives from the Ministry of Railways and party and government representatives gave speeches. Finally, the company's colleagues presented the general manager with a large silver tripod, and the entire group took a photo together before the ceremony ended. Next, there were entertainment performances until noon before the gathering ended.</p>
<h3>General Manager's Report</h3>
<p>"Respected officials, honored guests, and colleagues, thank you for attending today's grand event. Our company is deeply honored. Our company has been established for five years. We have struggled through the difficulties and hardships of the aftermath of the January 28th Incident to reach today. I would like to briefly report on the company's business situation to you. Before the January 28th Incident, the company started with four buses and gradually expanded to twenty-six buses. The speed of progress was gratifying. However, due to the soaring price of gold and the high cost of gasoline, the company not only failed to make a profit, but actually lost money. Heng Company focused on local transportation, so it continued to support itself. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident suddenly broke out, and the local area was devastated. The company bore the brunt, and its houses were destroyed by fire. The company suffered this misfortune and had little hope of recovery. Later, thanks to the proper deployment of the 19th Route Army and the former Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Huang Boqiao, the company's vehicles benefited greatly from providing military transportation. By the time the ceasefire agreement was concluded, the company had suffered heavy losses, but fortunately, thanks to the efforts of its colleagues, it still shouldered the responsibility of local transportation. Afterwards, the residents gradually moved back, and business gradually improved. Over the past year, it has been fortunate enough to recover its former appearance. However, the responsibility for future progress is even greater than before. Shanghai's preliminary plans have been successfully completed. In order to revitalize the city center, it is planned to open a route in the city center. However, the establishment of this plan requires a capital of 500,000 yuan to be successful. However, the colleagues are all deeply aware of the importance of the matter. Labor and management have always cooperated and taken a pragmatic approach as a prerequisite. Of course, we will continue to adhere to our original intentions in order to make progress. We also hope that all sectors of society will protect and assist the establishment of public utilities, which is not easy. This is what the colleagues hope for."</p>
<h3>Siming District Court's Embezzlement Case Subpoenas Lin Yutang to Testify</h3>
<p>The writer Lin Yutang, a famous author of our time, resides at No. A43 Yidingpan Road. Yesterday, the First Special District Court, in the case of Zhang Jiaxin's embezzlement of the Siming District Court, subpoenaed Lin to testify. The subpoena was delivered by a Chinese detective, but Lin was out. It was then sent to the office of the Academia Sinica, but Lin had already left after finishing his work. Therefore, the trial was held in the Third Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The Chinese detective reported the situation to Judge Wu Tingqi, who ordered a postponement to the afternoon of the 23rd of this month and reissued the subpoena.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing Accused of Defamation</h3>
<p>The merchant Rong Zongjing was recently sued by Wang Beiping, who hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court for defamation. Judge Huang Risheng was scheduled to hold a special hearing in the Ninth Criminal Court on Saturday (the 18th), but the defendant Rong Zongjing failed to appear, so the proceedings could not be carried out. Judge Huang ordered Rong to be summoned to court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Grand Gathering for Chrysanthemums at Xiaoguan Garden</h3>
<p>The Xiaoguan Garden opened its grand gathering for chrysanthemums yesterday at the intersection of Jiangwan Water and Electricity Road. The garden displayed many famous chrysanthemums, all of which were rare varieties, divided into two main categories: potted chrysanthemums and fence chrysanthemums, with approximately seven or eight thousand plants. The variety of colors dazzled the eyes. Among the most notable varieties were those such as Tiger's Roar, Orangutan Crown, Agarwood Pavilion, and Gray Tassel. The flowers were elegant and spirited. New varieties such as Precious Lotus Platform, Peach Blossom Stream, Closing Moon, Lotus Root Clothing, and Moonlit Cold Spring also shone brightly and stood out from the crowd. There were also over a thousand pots of literary chrysanthemums, with the larger ones having branches and leaves that drooped down to a length of over ten feet, which was a truly spectacular sight. The guests who gathered that day included Yan Duhe, Chen Dazai, You Bankuang, Huang Zhuan Tao, and Shu Sheyu from the press. The Shishi Xinbao and the Da Wanbao sent reporters to the garden to take photographs. From the art world there were Shang Shengbo, Shen Yizhai, Zhang Yuguang, Qian Yitie, Shen Banlong, Wu Qingxia, and others, who not only sketched flowers on the spot, but also collaborated on a large painting entitled "Nine Autumns."

<h3>A Brief History of Haigbo Circus Rider White Torey</h3>
<p>The Haigbo Circus has a rider named White Torey who performs Roman riding, standing on the back of a galloping horse, while two other horses pass under him. He can control eight horses at once, sometimes even more than ten, which is a remarkable feat. He is a native of Spain and is now thirty-three years old. He was able to ride a horse at the age of three, as his father was also a famous rider in the circus world. He is amiable and friendly, and everyone in the circus world enjoys his company. He finds that it is easier to train male horses than female horses. The training period for horses of average intelligence ranges from four months to ten months. First, they must be taught their names, and then the directions of left, right, forward, and backward. Whipping is not the way to train a horse. The most intelligent horses are the easiest to train and can learn many skills in a few months. The most suitable age for training a horse is between three and seven years old. Horses are easy to understand, and their degree of obedience depends on whether their master loves them or not. Three years ago, he traveled to London with the circus. At that time, another circus was also performing nearby. He fell in love at first sight with a beautiful actress in that circus, and they were quickly married. It was a truly remarkable encounter. Now they are both in Shanghai, which can be said to be a match made in heaven.</p>
<h3>Paramount Hires an American Band to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Paramount Grand Ballroom, reputed to be the best in the Far East, has been advertising its magnificent architecture and exquisite equipment, causing great excitement among Shanghai's socialites and gentlemen, who have been spreading the news. It is learned that the Willington Orchestra, a group of eleven musicians hired from the United States, has boarded the Japanese Empress, a Changxing Company ship, and is sailing east. They are scheduled to arrive in port on the morning of the 21st. The band is famous throughout the New World, and invitations to participate in banquets and dances at winter resorts in South America and Cuba, as well as major radio broadcasts in major cities throughout the United States, are considered a great honor. The Victory Records featuring the band's music are among the most popular and widely sold records distributed by the Morrilee Foreign Firm. The band's reputation speaks for itself. It is also heard that the band includes a quartet specializing in the tango, whose melodious and graceful playing is unprecedented in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Public Security Bureau Permits Citizens to Report Flower Gambling Dens; Report to the Chiefs of Each District; Names Will Be Kept Strictly Confidential</h3>
<p>Guan Gong, chief of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Li Jing, chief of the Second District, reported that within their respective jurisdictions, vagrants and idlers often secretly set up flower gambling dens to lure people into gambling. The Bureau has strictly ordered police officers to investigate and arrest them, and there have been repeated successes, but the situation has not abated. Yesterday, Chief Guan and Chief Li, together with the chiefs of each police station, decided to allow citizens within their jurisdictions to secretly report flower gambling dens. The names of the reporters will be kept strictly confidential by the district and police station chiefs. It was also decided that the following measures would be taken against flower gambling dens: (1) Order the detectives stationed in each district to diligently arrest them; (2) Landlords are not allowed to rent houses to people associated with flower gambling dens; (3) Landlords who are found to have rented houses to flower gambling dens will be subject to severe penalties in accordance with the household registration law, so that the scourge of flower gambling can be completely eradicated in Nanshi to eliminate local concerns.</p>
<h3>The Domestic Cotton Fabric Market to Open on a Scheduled Basis; Resisting the Invasion of Japanese Yarn and Fabric</h3>
<p>The China National Cotton Fabric Market on Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road is scheduled to open for business on the 21st of this month. A letter has been sent to approximately 500 major companies and cotton fabric businesses, announcing the purpose of its business operations and hoping to receive strong support. The original letter is copied below: "Dear Sirs, the purpose of our company's organization is to assist in the promotion of domestic cotton yarn and thread and to strive for the development of domestic cotton fabrics. Our business objective is to view Japanese yarn and fabric as our hypothetical enemies. In other words, we are a bulwark against the invasion of Japanese yarn and fabric. Under this bulwark, our colleagues estimate that we can maintain the livelihood of nearly 20,000 local cotton fabric workers and resist approximately 6,000 pieces of Japanese yarn worth over 800,000 yuan per month. If this can be achieved, it will benefit both the national strength and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we cannot but hope that your esteemed company and your esteemed colleagues will understand their responsibilities for the survival of the nation and provide sympathetic assistance. Now that the organization is in place, we have scheduled to open for business on the 21st of this month. We will first establish sympathy and then select another date for the grand opening. As this matter concerns the cultivation of national strength and the benefit of the people's livelihood, we urge you to attend and provide guidance and purchase widely, so that 20,000 workers and domestic cotton yarn and fabric can rely on it."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Distribution by the St. Joseph's Charity</h3>
<p>The St. Joseph's Charity of the Hongkou Catholic Church has been established for eighteen years. The charity's work is divided into two types: one is the annual distribution of cotton clothes in winter, and the other is the periodic charitable activities, such as monthly cash subsidies. Yesterday afternoon, the Charity held its annual meeting at St. Francis School to discuss the distribution of cotton clothes. At that time, it was decided to distribute 490 sets of cotton clothes and 60 cotton quilts. All recipients of cotton clothes or quilts would also receive a rice coupon, which could be exchanged for five liters of white rice. In addition to cotton clothes and rice coupons, each person would also receive one yuan in cash and two loaves of bread. During the meeting, Bishop Huida of Jiangnan was invited to preside over the distribution. After the meeting, Bishop Hui delivered a sincere and concise speech, stating that at this time of cold weather and the end of the year, the poor who are suffering from hunger and cold are eagerly looking forward to the assistance of generous philanthropists to avoid freezing and starvation. Finally, he gave honorary awards to the enthusiastic donors. Before distributing the cotton clothes, the St. Joseph's Charity conducted a thorough investigation of the poor who would receive them. The investigation was conducted by the nuns of the Holy Family Society of the Hongkou Catholic Church. Because the nuns have a clinic in Yangshupu, the poor in that area and the surrounding neighborhoods can go to the clinic for treatment if they have diseases, and the nuns also often visit the poor, so they are very familiar with the situation of the poor. However, this measure is still a drop in the bucket, as the more than 500 pieces of cotton clothing are still not enough for equal distribution.</p>
<h3>Miss Megley Establishes an English Research Institute and Prepares to Expand Enrollment of New Students</h3>
<p>Miss Megley, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Oregon in the United States, has come to Shanghai this time and opened an English Research Institute on Haining Road in North Sichuan Road in this city. It is dedicated to providing a new shortcut for young people with aspirations to learn English and solve all the difficulties of learning English. It has only been open for two months, but Miss Megley's spirit of teaching students is full of energy and tireless, and her reputation is already remarkable. What is most admirable is that some of the elementary school students in the institute could only understand the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet when they first enrolled. Before long after entering the school, they have been able to answer and talk to Miss Megley fluently. The progress can be described as rapid, and it can be seen that the teaching method is new and unique. Miss Megley is now preparing to enroll new students in order to expand the institute. Those who are interested can go to the editorial department of the Shishi Xinbao in Cile Lane, next to the Butterfield &amp; Swire building on Nanjing Road, every day at 12:00 noon or 10:00 in the evening to discuss with Mr. Chen.</p>

<h3>Fire on Song Park Road, Nuns of Jile Temple Flee in Panic</h3>
<p>Zhao Shen, an old woman who lives in a thatched house at No. 1 on the north side of Zhongxing Road, Song Park Road, Zhabei, is 55 years old and from Funing. After her husband died, she left behind many children and her daily life depends on her earnings from sewing. At 1:30 yesterday morning, Zhao Shen accidentally left sparks while cooking, which led to carelessness. In an instant, the flames burst through the roof. Fortunately, the nearby police were informed and immediately notified the Zhabei fire brigade to quickly dispatch several fire trucks to try their best to extinguish the fire. By about 3:00 a.m., the fire was extinguished. In addition to burning down Zhao Shen's thatched house and 25 other households, the fire also spread to two tiled bungalows of the Jile Temple nunnery on the south side and three lead-skinned engine rooms of the Public Welfare Glass Factory, totaling more than 30 rooms, causing considerable losses. At that time, the nuns of Jile Temple were awakened in their sleep and were at a loss for a while. Because they were in a hurry to escape, they did not have time to wear long clothes and ran out in single shorts, which was very embarrassing. The neighbors helped each other, young and old, carrying boxes and luggage, and the order was extremely chaotic. Chen Jiwu, the chief of the Second Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, led police officers to the scene to suppress the situation and maintain order. Zhao Shen, who started the fire, was taken to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Youth and a Teenager Taking a Steamer to Qingdao are Suspicious</h3>
<p>At about 12:00 p.m. the night before last, at the Swire Company's Huatong Wharf in Pudong, a young man wearing a short coat and yellow pants, accompanied by a young girl, planned to take a Shandong steamer to Qingdao. The police on duty became suspicious and took them to the Third District. After interrogation by the district chief, the man confessed that his name was Shi Qingzhong, 24 years old, from Lai County, Shandong, and that he was a painter in Hangzhou. Today, he was returning to his hometown with his fiancée (referring to the girl) to visit his relatives. The girl's confession was very experienced. She claimed to be Zhang Yunshan, 16 years old, from Hangzhou, living at No. 8, Bazimen, Hangzhou. Her father had passed away and her mother lived in her grandmother's house. She had an older brother named Zhang Guiqi, who worked as an inspector on the Hangzhou Railway. She and Shi were in love and wanted to marry Shi as his wife. Her mother also knew about it, but her brother did not. Now she was returning to his hometown with Shi to inspect the family situation. She had stayed in a hotel in Puxi for two nights and had not had any physical relationship. The district chief believed that she claimed to be 16 years old, but she was short and only looked 12 or 13 years old, which was obviously untrue and there must be another reason. Shi was judged to have induced a girl under the age of 20 to leave her family and was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Russian Car Runs Over Rickshaw Puller and Breaks Both Legs</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller Li Deming is 33 years old and lives at No. 281, Yangjia Building, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. At about 6:00 p.m. the night before last, while pulling a rickshaw near Chenjiashu on Hongqiao Road, a car driven by two Russians suddenly came speeding from behind. Li tried to avoid it but was knocked down by the car, breaking both of his legs and injuring his head and face, and he was on the verge of death. The police on duty saw this and took the two Russians who caused the accident and the injured person to the Sixth District General Office for investigation. The injured person was ordered by the police to be sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was too serious and his life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Zoo Purchases New Giant Tortoise and Bats, and the Municipal Government Has Approved the Addition of Animal Houses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Zoo recently purchased a new giant tortoise and two large bats, which have been on display in the park since yesterday. The camellia finch competition that was launched has received a large number of registrations in recent days. The request to the municipal government to add various equipment has now been approved and construction has begun. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Tortoise and Bats</h3>
<p>Shen Xiangrui, the director of the park, is actively engaged in searching for various new and strange animals to the best of his ability. Recently, it was reported that there was a giant tortoise and two large bats, male and female, which were quite rare. He tried to ask people to purchase them, and they were transported here the day before yesterday. The tortoise is temporarily placed in a shallow pool with crocodiles. The tortoise is larger than usual, measuring about three feet long and more than two feet wide. The carapace is stacked very high and is covered with yellow patterns. The bats are the size of cats. When they flap their wings to fly, the wingspan reaches more than two feet. The eyes are bright and look very fierce. It is said that they are produced in India and are now placed in a large cage.</p>
<h3>Camellia Finch Competition</h3>
<p>The first camellia finch competition held by the park has been scheduled to be held on the 10th of next month at the Municipal Public Education Center. It is stipulated that those who want to participate must register before the end of this month, and the registration will be closed after the deadline. In recent days, many bird owners have come to register, all of which are famous species from Germany, the Netherlands, England, and our country. There are already more than a hundred birds. The association has now decided to notify the bird owners on December 9th to send the birds to the venue for the competition, and they can be taken back on the 11th. Various prizes are prepared to give to the winning bird owners.</p>
<h3>Adding Equipment</h3>
<p>The park had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, to add various equipment, including the construction of two large animal houses for leopards and bears, the construction of a large thatched pavilion, widening the sidewalks in the park, adding tap water faucets to the animal houses, and adding revetments to the ponds, which requires a large amount of funding. It is now known that the park has been approved by the municipal government and is allowed to proceed accordingly. Construction has begun and is expected to be completed within the year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Soldiers Eat for Free at Coffee Shops, Five Victims Have Already Filed Complaints with the Consulate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that recently, in various coffee shops and restaurants in the city, naval soldiers wearing Marine Corps uniforms have repeatedly appeared, eating for free without paying a penny. There have been five victims, who have successively reported the matter to the Japanese Consulate General. Later, the police of the consulate general, together with the military police, conducted a joint search. As a result, it was learned that the person was named Kubo Michiharu, a second-class engine soldier in the reserve navy from Honmoku-cho, Yokohama City, who entered the port on the Rokkomaru on the 13th. He was arrested at the Yuko Hotel on Youheng Road at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th and is currently being interrogated at the Japanese Consulate General. It was found that when Kubo entered the Yokosuka Naval Corps, he specialized in eating for free and was once sentenced to five months in prison by a military court for fraud. The victims in Shanghai this time were: 1. Yuko Hotel's accommodation fee of 13 yuan. 2. A headscarf coffee shop in the second alley of Youheng Road Sanbalu, 2 yuan and 4 jiao. 3. No. 6, Baodeli, Qiujiang Road, 15 yuan and 3 jiao. 4. Coffee shop at No. 12, Qiujiang Road, 30 yuan and 4 jiao. 5. Bali Coffee Shop at No. 127, Bazilu, 15 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Case of Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping to be Continued Today</h3>
<p>Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, the former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, were impeached by the Control Yuan and sent to the Shanghai First Special District Court for trial because there were 150,000 yuan of unaccounted funds in the accounts they submitted during their tenure. After receiving the document, the court immediately summoned the defendants and opened the first trial in the Eighth Criminal Court on the 30th of last month. At that time, because the defendants had not surrendered, the judge announced a postponement and instructed the defendants' defense lawyer to convey to the defendants that they should come to court next time to facilitate the proceedings and not be afraid. The defendants' defense lawyer agreed in court and withdrew. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the case has been rescheduled to be continued in the Eighth Criminal Court of the court at 2:00 p.m. today. It remains to be confirmed at the time of the hearing whether the defendants will comply with the summons and appear in court.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai County Government Strictly Prohibits Welcoming Assemblies and Performances</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has always prohibited welcoming assemblies and performances. At this time of rural decline and the withering of all industries, it is even more intolerable to have such labor-intensive and wasteful activities. It is found that in various places, people are still accustomed to the accumulated habits and take advantage of this slack farming season to raise funds for welcoming assemblies and performances in the name of praying for disaster relief and blessings. Such actions only increase the waste of the people, hinder social morality, and impede public security. Therefore, in addition to ordering the chiefs of each district and the chiefs of each public security bureau to strictly prohibit such activities, County Magistrate Pan also issued a proclamation to all the people in the county to inform them. Those who dare to violate the order will be severely investigated and punished.</p>
<h3>Huang Maolin Dies of Illness in Ceylon, Shanghai Lay Buddhist Association Launches a Funeral Donation</h3>
<p>The World News Agency said that the previous report that Buddhist Huang Songlin committed suicide in Greece was actually an erroneous report that Lay Buddhist Huang Maolin died of illness in Ceylon. The accurate details are extracted below: Lay Buddhist Huang Maolin was a Cantonese who was proficient in English. In the past, he studied Theravada Buddhism with the British in Hong Kong. Later, he came to Shanghai and worked as a translator for many years. He traveled with the lay Buddhists and then believed in Mahayana Buddhism. Lay Buddhist Di Chuqing asked him to translate the English version of the Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra (published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, many foreigners purchased and read it, and the London Buddhist Association had repeatedly entrusted the World News Agency to purchase hundreds of copies to send to England for resale by the association. The association also published a summary of its contents in the British Buddhist magazine, which shows its emphasis on this book). This was Mr. Huang's first contribution to the Buddhist community. Later, he entered the Buddhist Pure Karma Society and translated the Buddha's Sutra of Infinite Life and the Sutra of the Ten Wholesome Paths of Action, and founded the English-language Chinese Buddhist Magazine to promote Buddhism abroad. In February of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he vowed to go to India and Ceylon to study Pali and Sanskrit, so that he could return to China in the future to translate sutras and manage the promotion of Buddhism. Ye Yupu, Shen Xinshi, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Shengzhi, Shi Liangcai, Wang Qixiang, Di Chuqing, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi and other lay Buddhists were responsible for his tuition fees and household expenses, and Master Mingdao, Wang Shaohu, and Li Yuanjing also made vows to help. Zheng Mingrong was responsible for all matters related to proofreading and sending English magazines, foreign correspondence, and receiving and sending various funds. While in Ceylon, Mr. Huang also translated the Treatise on the Establishment of Consciousness-Only and sent it to Shanghai for typesetting and publication. Due to excessive mental exertion in his studies, he contracted lung disease and was hospitalized for treatment last year. After several months, he recovered slightly. Later, due to studying old courses, his old illness relapsed. According to recent telegrams, he has died of illness. Alas, there are very few Buddhists in our country who are proficient in English and also in Pali and Sanskrit. Mr. Huang vowed to promote Buddhism, traveled far away to study, but died of illness. It is truly a great misfortune for the Buddhist community that he carried his ambition with him to the grave. Mr. Huang's family in Hong Kong still has an 80-year-old grandmother, a 60-year-old mother, and a wife and children. After his death, they are desolate and without support. The local lay Buddhists held a meeting at the Pure Karma Society to discuss the issue of Mr. Huang's post-mortem affairs. Everyone believed that Mr. Huang had sacrificed himself for the Dharma and could not be without consolation, so they all agreed to donate funeral gifts. Ye Yupu and Shen Xinshi each donated 500 yuan, Guan Jiongzhi and Shi Shengzhi each donated 250 yuan, Huang Hanzhi and Ding Guicen each donated 200 yuan, Wang Yiting donated 100 yuan, and Li Fuhou donated 50 yuan. Wang Qixiang continued to help his family with 20 yuan per month. The collection of funeral gifts is still in progress. Lay Buddhist Li Jingwei of the Lay Buddhist Association also plans to launch a support campaign. Those who wish to donate funeral gifts can send them to the Shanghai Hurd Road Buddhist Pure Karma Society for collection and transfer. The society has receipts as proof. Alas, Mr. Huang is gone, and it is deeply hoped that someone will succeed him in the Buddhist community to fulfill Mr. Wang's ambition.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Public Works Repairs the Zhenda Road, and the International Telecommunications Bureau Subsidizes Wages of 7,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Zhenda Road from Zhenru to Dachang was mostly destroyed by Japanese artillery fire after the January 28th Shanghai War. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works had planned to immediately hire workers to repair it, but due to the lack of funds, it has not been repaired, causing the road surface to be gradually occupied by farmers. It is now known that the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is now eager to install underground cables on the road and has sent a letter to the Bureau of Public Works requesting a quick repair and is willing to subsidize wages of 7,000 yuan in order to speed up the completion. However, after a detailed estimate of the cost of road repair by the Bureau of Public Works, it was found that it would cost more than 15,500 yuan, which is still 8,000 yuan short. The Bureau of Public Works has submitted the situation to the Municipal Government for review, and the Municipal Government has approved the appropriation of funds for repair, so the road will be repaired soon.</p>
<h3>The Candle Industry Association Unifies Candle Prices, All Colleagues Must Comply, and Those Who Dare to Disobey Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association notified its members yesterday that, for the sake of notification, it was resolved by all members on the first of this month that the minimum retail price of candles per catty must be 4 jiao and 4 fen, and the wholesale price of candles per dan must be 32 yuan. In addition to notifying by letter, it has also been reported separately to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Hereafter, all colleagues must comply, and no one is allowed to disobey in secret. If there are still incidents of distributing leaflets, disrupting prices, and giving away flower candles, once the facts are verified, it will be reported to the competent authorities for strict punishment. Do not say that you were not warned.</p>
<h3>The United States in 1936</h3>
<p>The third lecture of the 1936 System Lecture Series of the Shanghai YMCA was held the night before last. Chen Liting, a YMCA staff member, lectured on the United States in 1936. The Bingxun Chinese Shorthand Agency was present to take shorthand notes. The general idea was that the United States' foreign policy can be divided into two points: (1) the Monroe Doctrine, that is, the United States and European countries do not interfere with each other in politics; (2) the Open Door Policy, the purpose of which is to prevent countries from interfering with the development of American commerce in China, China can exercise its sovereignty and create an equal balance of power in China. However, Japan also advocates the Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine, which is tit-for-tat with the United States. Therefore, a war between the United States and Japan is inevitable. The United States has made considerable progress in implementing the planned economy. In the future, if it goes to war with Japan, all facilities will be a strong backing.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Change in Taxation of Apartments in the French Concession, Colleagues are Organizing an Association</h3>
<p>There were originally only 14 apartments in the French Concession, and they had not paid taxes. Later, because these economic hostels were actually convenient for the establishment of merchants traveling to Shanghai, they have gradually developed in recent years. No less than dozens of them have been opened one after another in the new western district of the French Concession. In order to maintain the public welfare of the industry, the French authorities specially approved the issuance of apartment licenses to the first 14 apartments and collected taxes appropriately. For several years, they have been at peace with each other. Unexpectedly, in recent years, the number of apartments opened later has gradually increased. The authorities have changed the tax of the new apartment licenses to the hotel license tax. However, the 14 apartments still collect taxes according to the previous regulations. Unexpectedly, this time, the licenses of the Datong, Central, and Xindu apartments were suddenly revoked by the French authorities due to the change of address, and they were ordered to apply for hotel industry licenses. Therefore, all colleagues were panicked and disputes arose. In addition to sending a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession to advocate justice and maintain the status quo, one of the apartments also applied to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to organize the Shanghai Apartment Industry Association in order to unite colleagues and formulate industry rules for protection. It is heard that the Municipal Party Department has approved the industry to organize an industry association and issued a permit to allow its establishment. However, it is heard that the tax office of the French authorities has sent letters to the three apartments because they do not agree to change the hotel license tax, notifying the three apartments that if they do not pay the tax, they will cut off the water and electricity supply. Water and electricity are daily necessities for travelers and cannot be interrupted for a day. Forced by necessity, they had to pay the tax temporarily. On the one hand, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, they publicly elected representatives Tao Yongchang and Yang Buzhou to go to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to petition. Chairman Du Yuesheng personally received them and inquired in detail about the opinions of the representatives' petition. He ordered them to provide details of the different nature of apartments and hotels to the association and then find a way to mediate in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. The representatives were satisfied and left. The Preparatory Office of the Industry Association, in addition to notifying the colleagues to wait for Chairman Du's mediation, plans to convene a meeting of industry representatives on a scheduled date to discuss countermeasures and the progress of the association.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of All Business Associations in the French Concession Decides that the Business Associations Will Continue to Proceed</h3>
<p>The original business associations in the French Concession have been suspended for a long time since the establishment of the district branches of the Second Special District Citizens' Association. Recently, because the commercial market in the French Concession has plummeted, and in order to revitalize commerce and restore the market under the current economic downturn, the work of the business associations must continue. Therefore, the leaders of the business associations held a joint meeting at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday at the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association. The representatives attending were Li Weiliang of the French Concession Business Association, Xu Xiuting of the Nanyang Bridge Business Association, Zhu Shengmao of the Caishi Street Business Association, Gong Jingyan and Cheng Zhusun of the Tangjiawan Business Association, Jin Liren and Sheng Zhiren (Zhang Zhengang 代) of the French Concession West District Business Association, Lu Tingjian and Tong Lizhang of the Avenue Edward VII Business Association, Zhang Gengshan (Wu Guowei 代) of the New West District Twelfth Road Business Association, Zhou Chengxiang and Tang Jingxi of the Xujiahui Business Association, and Wu Liangsheng of the Minguo Road Business Association. Li Weiliang, Long Jingyan, and Jin Liren were publicly elected as the temporary presidium, and Yu Jingqing was the recorder. After the ceremony, Chairman Li Weiliang first reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that since the suspension of the business associations, the commercial market in the French Concession has become increasingly depressed. Not to mention the business of the shops, there has been no improvement, and various situations are declining day by day. Even if we take the Avenue Edward VII area as an example, the houses are empty and visible everywhere. The number of large shops that have closed down and are being liquidated is increasing day by day. No one is asking about the newly built houses. The original residents of the lane are also moving out one after another. Under such circumstances, if we want to revive the market and maintain commerce, we must unite our groups and deliberate on a long-term plan. All of you who are present today are aware of this kind of pain. How should we proceed? Please discuss it. Next, after the representatives successively expressed their opinions, the presidium summarized the opinions and resolved the following methods: (1) The original business associations will continue to proceed and start work. (2) However, the members of each business community have transferred to the Citizens' Association of each district, so the business associations will separately convene temporary meetings of members to discuss plans for the revitalization of the market and all the methods to proceed. (3) For all the work of restoring the association this time, the monthly membership dues of each member will be waived. (4) All necessary temporary expenses will be raised temporarily when necessary to avoid misunderstandings. (5) The original staff members of each association will temporarily assume their duties on a voluntary basis. The above methods are the guidelines for restoring the work of the association, which was unanimously approved. Next, the plan for revitalizing the market and maintaining commerce was discussed: (1) Regarding the increase in social living standards, the first step must be to reduce rents. (2) Regarding the method of reducing rents, the opinions of landlords, tenants, and the majority of citizens in the society must be solicited. (3) After soliciting opinions from all parties, the business associations will publish a joint detailed declaration stating the situation and the reasons for rent reduction in order to achieve mutual understanding between landlords and tenants, or to get landlords to automatically reduce and exempt tenants from excessive demands to achieve an average. (4) In addition, the society will consult and discuss with all parties on adjusting the social economy and reducing the daily life of the people. (5) The decline of social people's livelihood and the remedial methods will be submitted to the Chinese and foreign authorities for mutual relief in order to reduce the burden on merchants and citizens and prevent the foundation of the country and society from being shaken. All the above methods were approved, and Tong Lizhang and Shao Bingyuan were asked to draft them. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Jiangning County Education Leaps Forward ▲ Compulsory Education Can Surely Be Universalized Within Three Years ▲ Social Education Can Certainly Be Promoted to the People ▲ Private Schools Are Gradually Assimilating with Schools Through Improvement</h3>
<p>Since Jiangning County was changed to an autonomous experimental county and the County Education Bureau was reorganized into a section, with County Magistrate Mei Siping's dedication to governance and the efforts of Wang Guobin, the Chief of the County Education Section, coupled with the expansion of education funding, Jiangning County's education has made rapid progress. It has not only changed its old appearance, but it is feared that many counties in this province and other provinces are beyond its reach. The actual situation of the county's solid promotion of education is now recorded below in summary:</p>
<p>(1) "Regarding compulsory education," the county estimates that the popularization of compulsory education requires approximately 500,000 yuan in funding, while the total expenditure for various undertakings in the county is only 700,000 yuan. If relying solely on the government, it would be difficult to achieve universalization due to funding constraints. Therefore, villagers are encouraged to take the initiative. Each township head can raise funds on their own based on the funds they can plan, and establish elementary schools in their respective townships. The township head and the elementary school principal jointly form an economic committee, responsible for planning, managing, and allocating school funds. Local taxes are used to run local education, and villagers have obligations and rights, optimistically achieving success. Currently, Jiangning County has 22 township-run elementary schools established in various townships (this can be expanded to 30 by the end of the year), along with more than 110 county-run schools (many county-run elementary schools have already been expanded this year). Furthermore, the compulsory education experimental zone organized by Qixia Rural Teachers' School can be expanded to 24 schools (the Jiangsu Education Department is running a compulsory education experimental zone in Qixia, planning to establish 24 schools, and 16 schools have already been established. Jiangning County will have the 24 schools located in townships belonging to Ning completely managed by Qixia Rural Teachers' School, without setting up additional township elementary schools). The total of the above three items is approximately 170 schools. Since Jiangning was restructured, the land area occupied by townships has been reduced, and the number of townships has increased. The county has a total of 295 townships. In addition to the aforementioned 170 schools occupying more than 170 townships, if each township were to establish a school, 120 more schools would need to be added. If each township has a school, compulsory education can be popularized. Based on the school expansion this year, another part will be promoted next spring, and another part will be implemented next autumn. In the following year, township-run schools can be established everywhere. Universalizing compulsory education within three years is not just empty talk.</p>
<p>(2) "Regarding social education," the county merged social education institutions into schools for concurrent management after the bureau was changed to a section. Ten central elementary schools and two experimental elementary schools were established. These two types of schools have more facilities for social education. For example, the Yanziji Elementary School's sports field has martial arts teachers who teach martial arts to the public. Seventy or eighty villagers come to practice martial arts every day. The teachers and the public at Yaohuamen Elementary School organize ball teams to cooperate in competitions. Central elementary schools such as Maqun can also use the public's spare time for sports to implement social education. In addition, ordinary elementary schools all have reading rooms for the public, and the Education Section has allocated funds for each school to purchase books and newspapers. For public medical treatment, in larger township schools, the teachers responsible for school health provide medical treatment for the public. Ordinary elementary schools also have quinine boxes and other medicines to help the public's health. Currently, 100 elementary schools in the county have farms. In addition, each school also has parks and sports fields as public facilities.</p>
<p>(3) "Regarding improving private schools," the county set up training centers for private school teachers in the sub-districts within each central elementary school, recruiting qualified private school teachers (more than 300 in the county) to attend training. Currently, the districts have either completed their first graduation or are in progress. The private school teachers are working very hard to improve themselves. Those who don't work hard will eventually be eliminated. Those who have made progress in their studies, after considerable training, can become elementary school teachers. It is said that the results of the training are very good. Now, when going to the townships, the private schools, at a minimum, teach the three subjects of party principles, national language, and arithmetic. Many private schools can also use blackboards to teach like schools.</p>
<p>In addition, for the professional development of elementary school teachers in the county, a rotating training center for elementary school teachers was established a month and a half ago. The training lasts for three months, and lectures are given on various courses related to rural education. The first class consists of former elementary school teachers or those with equivalent academic qualifications (30 people). After graduation, they will be sent to schools as substitute teachers, and general incumbent elementary school teachers will be transferred to the training center to supplement the courses they lack or that are necessary for modern rural education, so that they can adapt to the trend and learn from each other. This type of training center has a longer study period than various summer training sessions and is more focused, so it seems to be more effective.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Mei Siping believes that the County Education Section is located outside the county government (the County Education Bureau was changed to a section but still operates at the old site on West Gongyuan Street), which is inconvenient for handling various matters. Now, a portion of the property in the county government has been vacated, and the Education Section was completely moved into the government office on the 19th during the weekend holiday. The former Education Section (i.e., the old site of the Education Bureau) will be used as a dormitory for staff of the Education and other sections.</p>

The Education Bureau has approved the resumption of classes from today. The school specifically notified the parents of all students yesterday, stating that the school has been ordered by the Education Bureau to open.

The school hereby notifies that it will resume classes as usual from November 20th.

<h3>30th Anniversary of Minli Middle School</h3>
<p>Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, was founded by Su Muchao. The school currently has more than 1,500 students and is very developed. This year marks its 30th anniversary. The school authorities have organized a preparatory committee, which has held several preparatory meetings. It was originally scheduled to be held on December 6th, but due to the time-consuming nature of all preparations, it has now been decided to hold a grand anniversary celebration on December 26th, with the addition of various games, movies, and other programs. The school will also assign drawing or writing tasks to all students with the best grades, and the students' works will be displayed for viewing during the anniversary celebration. Therefore, teachers and students have been actively working on all the drawings and writings in recent days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Alumni of China Public School Prepare for Alumni Association</h3>
<p>China Public School in Wusong has been operating for more than 30 years, with more than 8,000 alumni. There had been preparations by alumni before, but they were eliminated invisibly due to disputes over the fund lottery. Now, the school's alumni remaining in Shanghai cannot bear to sit idly by and are preparing again, actively proceeding. Yesterday, in order to develop the association's affairs, they held the fifth preparatory meeting at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, Xiafei Road, and decided to hold an inaugural meeting on December 17th, and appointed Zhou Xianchu, Long Yingjie, Nie Haifan, He Jia, Mao Fangmei, and other alumni to be responsible for handling it.

<h3>Tonghua Japanese Language School Opens on the 20th</h3>
<p>The Shangshao Tonghua Japanese Language School was founded by Zheng Zhaoyang and others. The school aims to use young people's spare time to study Japanese. The teachers hired are all veterans who have studied in Japan for many years and have rich experience. In terms of organization, it is divided into correspondence and face-to-face departments, and each department is further divided into beginner, advanced, and special levels. The tuition is low, and the location is convenient (Xiehe Lane, Parker Road), so since its opening, new student registration has been very enthusiastic. It is also heard that the school is scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Youyou Defeated Donghua 3 to 2 (Division A Football) Three Donghua Generals Injured and Forced to Leave the Field Greatly Reduced Strength, Hope Extinguished Jinan Tied with Huacesi 1 to 1</h3>
<p>Donghua played Youyou in the Western League Division A match at Yiyuan yesterday. Donghua generals such as Li Ning were injured and forced to leave the field. In the end, they fought with eight players against eleven, allowing Youyou to take advantage and lose 2 to 3.</p>
<h3>General Observation of the Situation</h3>
<p>The strength of the two Baoli teams is similar. Youyou's forwards are sharp, and Donghua's internal defense is strong. Donghua's fatal injury was the injury and departure of three players, fighting with eight players against ten. Otherwise, based on the situation on the day, Donghua's hope of victory was stronger. After the center forward was injured and left the field, Cao Qiuting still scored one goal in the middle. When Li Ning was also injured, they could still support for 20 minutes. It was not until the last ten minutes that they lost two consecutive goals. In the second half, in a situation where the number of people was unequal, each side scored one goal. If the situation changes, the result will definitely be different.</p>
<h3>Taking the Initiative</h3>
<p>Not long after the fierce battle began, Chen Hongguang whipped his horse deeper. A ball turned in from the right, and Hongguang touched his inspiration, greeted the door with a quick shot, and Tang Yongchun, the goalkeeper with superior talent, made a writing fall to the ground, hugging it in his arms, and the danger was resolved immediately. Youyou's spirit was greatly enhanced, but Li Shuoyou's two excellent crosses lacked a receiver, and the good opportunity was lost. Wu Youliang took a free kick, 30 yards from the goal, and it fell right in front of the goal. The center forward shot with his foot, hit the goalpost, and bounced back to the original place, followed by a header, but he was injured and left the field, and Donghua fought with ten players. Cao Qiuting was exceptionally lively, assisted by Jia Youliang's cleverness, and broke into the formation in one go, shooting in a goal.</p>
<h3>Generals Injured</h3>
<p>The center forward returned to the position and continued to fight. At that time, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, Wan Xianghua, and Cao Qiuting put on amazing performances, and the entire army's momentum was very strong. A sudden stroke of fortune, Li Ning was injured and left the field for rest, and the center forward's head injury had not healed, so he also withdrew from the team. Only nine people were officially on the field. Feng Yunyou retreated to the inner guard, Tu Kaiyuan took control of the center, and Chen Hongguang was transferred back to the internal defense. With such an arrangement, they could still cope with the strong enemy, for as long as 15 minutes. Chen Jiaqiu suddenly made a bottom shot, and Lu Zhongen bent down to save, which was not easy. After another five minutes, Donghua's defense relaxed slightly, and Chen Jiaqiu came again and tied the score at 1 to 1. Then Sun Jinshun shot into the goal alone, and Youyou won the first half 2 to 1.</p>
<h3>Hope Extinguished</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Donghua still faced the enemy with nine players, but the line of defense was changed, taking care of both inside and outside. Youyou's Sun Jinshun and Chen Jiaqiu repeatedly explored the dragon gate, and Mr. Lu took care of everything, leaving no time to attack. Zhong Yongshen, like a flying horse, rushed for thousands of miles and succeeded again, entering the door and making it 3 to 1. Donghua used attack as defense, focusing all its efforts on the outside, and launched several fierce attacks. Although it did not hit the target, its momentum was still strong. Wan Xianghua cleverly avoided the enemy generals, broke through several levels in a row, turned his foot and picked it up, and Jia Youliang was right in the way, fell to the ground and shot it in, making it 2 to 3, and hope gradually arose. Suddenly, Cao Qiuting was also injured and left the field, leaving only eight warriors. A ray of hope was thus extinguished. At that time, the forwards on both sides were engaged in fierce shooting. Fortunately, the goalkeepers did their duty and were able to coexist peacefully. As a result, Youyou won the final victory 3 to 2.</p>

<h3>Another Tie Jinan and Huacesi 丨1 to 1丨</h3>
<p>The Western League Division A match between Jinan and Huacesi met yesterday at the China Baseball Field. The first half was extremely exciting. Jinan's goalkeeper Xu Heng made countless high and low saves, and was greatly applauded by the audience. Thanks to Xu Yahui's foot, they took a 1 to 0 lead. However, in the second half, Yahui injured his foot and retreated to the defender position, and the front line was powerless. However, giving up offense and taking defense is inevitable to lose. In the end, Huacesi's Aqiao scored a goal, and the score was tied again at 1 to 1, which was equal to the record of the previous Skota Cup match.</p>
<p>▲Jinan Lineup</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Gu Shangxiang, Lai Zuorong, Yun Fengwu, Chen Zhenxiang, Hua Lunyan, Yin Guiyi, Cai Lingcai, Xu Yahui, Luo Haiguang, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>▲Huacesi Lineup</p>
<p>Hebart, Tao Lewei, Gelaiton, Wilson, Shi Ningsi, Li Quezhi, Pike, Aqiao, Mao Lun, Foge Tuo, Xiebate</p>
<h3>Jinan's Lineup</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Jinan lineup was slightly different from before. Xu Yahui was the center forward, and the center back was Chen Zhenxiang, which was the most economical plan. However, Hua Lunhen's defender was sometimes weak and slow to kick. The two forwards on the left side were still not improving. The center back line was very poor. The forward Yahui was too fast, and the others were too slow, so there was a situation where they could not cooperate. In addition, Luo Haiguang has not recovered from his foot injury in the Skota Cup match, and his movements are inconvenient, which is a great disadvantage. Xu Heng's goalkeeping was outstanding, with the general idea of one man guarding the pass, no one can break through. The performance was better than expected, and the lost goal was out of helplessness.</p>
<h3>Poor Refereeing</h3>
<p>Referee Marshall has had disturbances in past matches, and I dare not admire his refereeing skills. He believes that Jinan can be deceived and suppresses it, which is really a loss of the referee's Xiong degree. Yesterday, there were many abuses, which deeply dissatisfied the audience. Several penalty kicks were nitpicking. In the second half, the hillbillies were very angry and acted rudely without punishment. Jinan also stubbornly resisted, and the competition became more intense, but they turned a blind eye. Neither side was given a penalty, which was inevitable to lose its dignity.</p>
<h3>Thrills Seen</h3>
<p>Huacesi kicked off and went straight to Jinan's lair, closely surrounding it, advancing and advancing again. The danger in front of Jinan's goal could not be avoided, and a free kick was awarded on the left. Xu Heng pushed it to the back, and a wonderful corner kick was sent to the right wing. Xu Heng saved it again, and Jinan escaped the tiger's mouth. Xu Yahui led the army forward, and Mei Hongbao's wonderful pass, Xu Yahui and Yun Fengwu both had shots, but they failed to hit the target. The rear was in danger again, Pike had two corner kicks, Xu Heng turned the danger into safety, and he could not even care about it. Cai Lingcai brought the ball to attack, and when he reached the penalty area, the hillbillies saw that the opportunity was not good, and knocked Cai down from behind, but the referee turned a blind eye, and the audience was in an uproar. Mei Hongbao advanced again, and Li Quezhi committed a handball, but it was not punished. Jinan lost two opportunities in misfortune, and the audience roared at the referee.</p>
<h3>Yahui Made a Contribution</h3>
<p>Half an hour later, Jinan's Yin Guiyi launched an uprising on the border, struggling with Li Quezhi, and Yun Fengwu stepped forward to respond, breaking through two passes, and passing the ball in front of the goal at the baseline. Xu Yahui was in the right position, waiting for the transfer to be correct. Seeing the ball, he shot sideways in the momentum, and flew straight to the corner of the goal. The goalkeeper could not turn around in time, and there was no way to save it. Jinan won a goal, and the hillbillies were not willing to give up. They led their troops to retreat and kill, and Mao Lun showed his cow strength, rushing from left to right, deep into the gate, raised his foot and shot fiercely, the ball hit the ground and rolled sharply towards the corner of the door, Xu Heng's eyes and hands were quick, and he knocked the ball out to the ground, the enemy's ambition did not die, and he advanced again, surrounding the goal and launching a fierce shot, all of which were blocked by Xu Heng's high and low intercepts without any success.</p>
<h3>Carelessness Lost</h3>
<p>After the break, Xu Yahui injured his foot and retreated as an inner guard, Luo Haiguang's actions became more and more uninspired, and the front line was increasingly unsustainable. However, defending more than attacking is inevitable to lose. Since Huacesi had no worries, they launched the entire army to the front line and besieged Jinan. Therefore, Jinan's rear was surrounded by enemies on all sides, and it was impossible to defend against. Xu Yahui and Gu Shangxiang's escort was effective, and Xu Heng's reception was effective, and although the enemy's momentum was strong, there was no flaw to attack, but the wise are already worried, there must be a loss. After a long time, Aqiao finally shot in a goal, which was caused by the misunderstanding between Xu and Gu.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Chaotic</h3>
<p>Since then, the competitive situation has changed. Jinan had no way to win, but only hoped to maintain a draw. Even if they wanted to win, they could not in fact. The entire army retreated, one-on-one, entangled the enemy, without letting go at all. Mei Hongbao ran around the world on the right wing, implementing a chaos-making doctrine, and at one time specialized in kicking the boundary ball, and received a warning from the referee. The enemy army saw that the plan was not working, and roared greatly, acting rudely, and the referee did not consult and allowed them to do what they wanted, the situation became more and more mixed, and there was no interest to speak of, and it ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<h3>Chen Baoqiu Throws Shot Put 12.42 Meters</h3>
<p>White Rainbow Track and Field Team Overwhelms Russian and Japanese Teams</p>
<p>The White Rainbow, Russian, and Japanese Triangular Sports Meet was held yesterday at Hongkou Park. Spectators numbered in the thousands, filling the venue and surrounding areas. Chen Baoqiu's shot put of 12.41 meters broke the national record, making it the most valuable achievement. Tie Niu exceeded 12 meters three times, with another throw of 12.30 meters, which was also remarkable. Zhang Jiakui's long jump of 6.735 meters was exceptionally beautiful, but Zhang himself was not satisfied because he had a practice record of 7.15 meters last week. Xiao Dinghua's high hurdles time of 16.7 seconds was an improvement over his performance at the National Games. Fu Baolu barely managed 3.68 meters due to the darkness. Gu Yu was not pleased, as he only achieved a height of 1.67 meters due to the crowded audience. In the middle-distance events, White Rainbow's Liu Fukang, Zeng Rongzhong, and Guan Changfa were all absent, creating a precarious situation. Fortunately, Wu Zijing stepped in to save the day, winning two championships. The triple jump, discus throw, and relay race will be moved to next Sunday. Currently, White Rainbow leads with a total score of 71 points, followed by the Russian team in second place with 43 points, and the Japanese team in third place with 29 points.

<h3>Shanghai-Hua Long-Distance Race: Lan Shijie Wins with a Flying Pace in 1 Minute 4 Seconds and 6 Seconds丨Ren Su, First in Member Group丨</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hua round-trip long-distance race, organized by the Xiguang Cross-Country Team, started yesterday morning in the misty dawn in front of the Minli Middle School gate on Zhonghua Road. Originally, there were 48 participants, but 6 were absent, so only 42 people participated. The first to reach the finish line was Lan Shijie, with a time of 1 minute, 4 seconds, and 6 seconds. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ First Gunshot: Around 7 o'clock, all racers arrived one after another to register. At 7:45, Han Yongkui fired the starting gun. The racers then proceeded along Zhonghua Road like dragons and horses, each running their own course.</p>
<p>▲ Xuecheng Leads: Turning from Xiaoximen into Dalin Road, Daxing Street, and then Lujiabang Road, Wu Xuecheng led the pack, followed by Li Xingen, Liang Yaoting, and Shao Yajun, about 50 meters behind the leader. Chen Hongcai, Ye Xiaoxian, Pan Gongbao, and Lan Shijie formed a row, moving across the road like a human shield, making it difficult for those behind to overtake. Further behind were Wang Liegeng and Chen Shiyi.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Changes: On Longhua Road, Wu Xuecheng's position remained unchanged. Wang Liegeng and Chen Shiyi broke through the human shield, overtaking Li Xingen and occupying the second and third positions, about ten meters behind the leader. Shao Yajun fell behind by 100 meters, dropping to fifth place. Chen Hongcai, Ye Xiaoxian, and Lan Shijie, with confidence, remained calm, moving slowly. Guan Youwen followed closely behind, while Cao Huafa and Liang Yaoting formed a group.</p>
<p>▲ Hongcai Advances: Near Longhua Temple, Chen Hongcai, who had been sticking to the human shield strategy, suddenly surged forward, overtaking Wang Liegeng and passing Wu Xuecheng, taking the lead. Ye Xiaoxian, Lan Shijie, and Pan Gongbao had each occupied the top four positions, while Guan Youwen occupied the fifth spot. Wu Xuecheng fell back by about 100 meters.</p>
<p>▲ Shijie Unleashes Power: From Longhua back to Rihui Bridge, Lan Shijie accelerated his pace, jumping into the lead. Chen Hongcai, seeing the championship being snatched away, was uneasy. Although he used all his strength, he was unable to keep up due to a lack of stamina. Guan Youwen took third place, followed by Ye Xiaoxian, Pan Gongbao, and others.</p>
<p>Mistaken Path: When passing the Manufacturing Bureau Road, turning onto Dalin Road and entering Zhonghua Road, the rankings of the racers were roughly determined. At this time, Chen Hongcai, who was in third place, took a wrong turn due to the negligence of the guide. Although directed back by passersby, he had run an extra 200 meters. Pan Gongbao and Ye Xiaoxian seized the opportunity to move up. In a flash, about 800 meters from the finish line, Lan Shijie, feeling uneasy about Guan Youwen's close pursuit, decided to leave him behind and grit his teeth for a final sprint. Sure enough, Guan Youwen was left behind by over 100 meters. At this time, near Minli Middle School, the crowd was massive and noisy. Amidst the cheers, Lan Shijie strode in proudly, first to step onto the virgin line, followed by Guan Youwen, Pan Gongbao, Ye Xiaoxian, and Chen Hongcai, who arrived later.</p>
<p>▲ Many Veterans: Among the top five this time, except for Guan Youwen, the others all scored points in the Shanghai-Kunming long-distance race organized by the Zhonghua Sports Association this summer and can be considered veterans.</p>
<p>▲ Honor Roll: First place Lan Shijie, second place Guan Youwen, third place Pan Gongbao, fourth place Ye Xiaoxian, fifth place Chen Hongcai.</p>
<p>▲ Member Rankings: First place Ren Su, time 1 minute 12 seconds 54 seconds, First place Wu Chunyuan, third place Zhu Bingxiong, fourth place Niu Zengbei, fifth place Guan Yunxiang, sixth place Yao Zhongsheng.</p>
<p>▲ Completed the Entire Course: Le Junchang, Chen Shiyi, Wu Xuecheng, Li Xingen, Cao Huafa, Wang Duoyi, Wang Liegeng, Liang Yaoting, Shao Yajun, Wang Zhanchun, Sun Keming, Wang Yulin, Wang Mingqing, Gao Zhifang, Xi Pindao, Bao Chunlin, He Yaoming.</p>
<p>▲ Awards Postponed: The team has not yet collected all the prizes donated by various parties, and it has been decided to postpone the awarding ceremony to a later date.</p>

<h3>Private Shangzhong Basketball Team Wins Two and Loses One on Jiaxing Expedition</h3>
<p>Private Shanghai Middle School on Jiaozhou Road has been paying great attention to sports training in recent years. In the spring of this year, they won the runner-up in group exercises at the municipal middle school sports meet. This time, an expedition basketball team was organized, led by sports instructor Wu Shijun, to Jiaxing by Shanghai-Hangzhou train earlier this month, competing with Xiuzhou Middle School, Jiaxing Junior High School, and Jiaxing Sports Association. Jiaxing schools have always been renowned for their sports. Recently, the Zhijiang University Meteor Team from Hangzhou came to Jiaxing, and were defeated in both matches. This time, the school won two and lost one, which was quite a sensation in Jiaxing.</p>

<h3>Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"When chess players meet their match, when generals encounter worthy opponents, when both sides are evenly matched and the battle is fierce," only then does the importance of this war become apparent; it also makes those who love to watch the excitement exhilarated.</p>
<p>Engage in a battle of wits! Zhuge Liang meets Sima Yi. Engage in a battle of strength!莽 Zhang Fei meets the brave Ma Chao. People who love to read novels always have an excited expression and are always talking about it with great enjoyment when they see this part. Why is that? It's because the two sides are evenly matched.</p>
<p>Speaking of football matches, the East China team meets the West Hill Eight. Basketball matches, the West YMCA versus the China United Team. Tennis matches, Lin Baohua meets Qiu Feihai. I guarantee you will see crowds of people. Why is that? It's also because the two sides are evenly matched.</p>
<p>Extending this further, the previous European War lasted for several years: millions were killed and wounded until both sides were exhausted before they were willing to stop fighting and negotiate peace. This is also because the forces were evenly matched.</p>
<p>Looking at the above examples, conversely; the least exciting and least valuable trick is of course the "one-sided" war, the so-called "the strong bully the weak, the many oppress the few, the big bully the small."</p>
<p>Alright! According to newspaper reports: "The situation between Japan and Russia is becoming increasingly tense." According to the observations of military experts from various countries: "The situation in the Pacific in 1936 cannot be avoided." That is an evenly matched battle, how exciting! How energetic! It will definitely exceed past achievements and set records that will shock future generations. It is definitely not like the "one-sided" situation that we are just playing with. Look! Watch patiently! This unrevealed exciting and energetic trick is being prepared to begin!</p>
<p>However, at this time, are we going to be high-class guests watching from the sidelines! Or will we take the initiative and raise the banner? That all depends on our own efforts and preparations!</p>
<h3>Watching a Monkey Show</h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums excitedly entered our ears from outside the door, so H and I were drawn outside by it.</p>
<p>In the open space in front of the newly built bungalow, girls, children, laborers, young masters, clerks, and hooligans stood in a circle. Standing in the middle was a burly and extraordinary man from the streets. He was shirtless, holding a gong and mallet in his hand, and his mouth loudly sang some kind of untuned tune that I couldn't quite understand. The gong and drum matched this tune, and there would definitely be a chaotic sound at the end of two or three lines of the tune. His high cheekbones and dark brown skin should be largely responsible for his unattractive appearance; however, this has nothing to do with him. What he has is an extraordinary ability to command and control monkeys and dogs that others cannot command and control!</p>
<p>I stretched my neck to look at the ground: Ah! A black-haired pug was walking in circles there. Its head and face were always facing the solitary master who was gesticulating in the middle. Its eyes also stared like lightning at its master, never shifting due to changes in direction while walking in circles. Near the street man’s standing position, there were also two bamboo rings about one foot in diameter, tightly connected to form an Arabic number 8. The master tapped the mallet on the gong, and spoke some words with chanting in his mouth, and it unhesitatingly drilled through one of the bamboo rings below; the master said "Please sit" and it actually sat on the ground like a stone lion; the master said "Walk again" and it stood up again and continued to walk in circles as before... In short, whatever the master said, it would do. How docile it was to be educated like that! I couldn't help but marvel inwardly: "Good dog, good dog!"</p>
<p>But this is not that great. What made us most engrossed was the jumping over the bamboo ring above. The master tapped the mallet on the bamboo ring as before, and then pointed upwards casually. Not only was it unwilling to obey the order to jump over, but it also grabbed the ground with both feet and barked ferociously; the master picked up a long whip and jokingly hit it, and it actually lunged towards the master's calf, intending to bite back. The unadaptive me thought it was really resisting desperately. Later, I heard the street man say something insightful: "Oh! You want money!" Then I realized that this was a comical grand performance of "colluding to defraud money."</p>
<p>The show is called monkey show, but in reality the pug is the protagonist. Finally, the monkey came on stage. The master taught it to sit on an iron top, and it sat on it very skillfully; the master gave it a small bamboo whip and taught it to imitate carrying a load, and it carried it very well like peddlers; but when the master taught it to wear a crown and black gauze hat, it did not know how to open the box to put it on itself; the master taught it to do somersaults, but it especially could not, and it unleashed its temper; therefore, the awkward master really took it out on it, pulling the iron chain hard, and using the long rattan to whip it as much as possible, swinging it in several large arcs in the air; however, what else could it do besides squeak and weep?</p>
<p>Therefore, it made me know everything bigger than this.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Pass Tea With Tender Feelings and Comfort Husband, Hurry to the Frontier, Force a Smile to Say Goodbye to Family</p>
<p>But seeing that Tian Qing only looked over and did not leave the ranks, he knew very well that discipline could not be violated due to personal matters. He just turned his pair of clear black and white eyes and smiled at Tian Qing. Tian Qing also nodded and smiled at him while walking. However, during this nodding and smiling, which lasted only a moment, Huang Manying's smiling face did not change color. Tian Qing had already walked past. Huang Manying stood there blankly for a while, then suddenly ran, following Ma Wu along one side of the street. However, Zhao Ziqiang had no time to look at others. He already saw that the wrinkles on his father's face were stacked layer upon layer. He touched his beard under his chin, from top to bottom, without stopping. His fiancé stood firmly by his side. Guizhi neither smiled nor nodded, nor did she even turn her eyes. She pinched a corner of her clothes with both hands and kept rubbing it. Her eye sockets were red, looking unlike the usual pair of ripe peaches. In order to please her fiancé, she had already cut off the long braids that Manchu women kept to show that they were unmarried. At this time, her head was disheveled with short hair, which further emphasized her thin and yellowish face. Only when Zhao Ziqiang walked up to them did her eyes move a little, and she bit her lip, showing a smile on her tearful face. Zhao Ziqiang could not go over to comfort his old father, let alone comfort his fiancé. As for his mother-in-law, he only glanced at her, as if he was keeping his face taut. He couldn't manage to arrange everything himself, so in his haste, he could only return their smiles. Naturally, Father Zhao was the first to nod and smile. Madam Jiang, unable to say anything about her son-in-law at this time, hid the thought of a successful campaign in her heart and also smiled at her son-in-law. Guizhi, because her smile elicited her husband's smile, naturally couldn't take back her smile. But in that moment of her smile, Zhao Ziqiang had already walked past with the team. (244)</p>
<h3>Trivia About the Suzhou Park Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Nangongsheng</p>
<p>After Suzhou Park held the Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition last year, everyone who visited praised the grandeur of the exhibition. There were countless kinds of goldfish and chrysanthemums, all rare and precious. However, the park authorities were not satisfied and held an even grander Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition again this year, starting on the tenth of this month. They widely solicited contributions in advance, and the fish and chrysanthemums that came from all directions were rare and precious. Among the goldfish, the Yuele Kingdom Goldfish Garden of Shanghai, with its most complete organization and largest scale, brought the precious goldfish it had collected over the years to participate in the park, which was the most distinctive feature.</p>
<p>This time's Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition created a chrysanthemum mountain in the movie theater, with more than 4,000 pots. The chrysanthemums were piled up on all sides, instantly forming a chrysanthemum kingdom, which was truly a garden of brocade, dazzling and spectacular. The East Chamber displayed many fine and famous chrysanthemums, with the tallest pot of main flower in the center. It was owned by the Banque Sinfrançaise. Named "Natural Residence", its color was yellow, a true Eastern Li chrysanthemum, worthy of the name. Banque Sinfrançaise’s famous flowers also included "Xi Shi Dancing" and "Lady Guo Guo," both of which were graceful and charming. The park itself also had two varieties, "Green Grass Spring Color" and "Blue Temples and Long Eyebrows," which were very elegant. The Sulun Silk Factory had "Imperial Concubine Bathing," "Sulun Weaver Girl," "Emerald Canopy Pearl Decorations," "Pink Haze Lotus Platform," "Emerald Bell," "Chang'e," "White Dragon Whiskers," etc. Kui You Society had a kind of "Tiger Whiskers," with a total of four flowers, which was a famous variety that had been extinct in Suzhou for many years. The grafted chrysanthemums produced by the Art Society had "Gold Back Big Red, Jianchun Luo, Cunning Colors Peony, and Neijin Ball" four different colors of chrysanthemums blooming on one branch, which was especially rare.</p>
<p>The West Pavilion was the place where the goldfish were exhibited. Chai Luolan and Yan Lord Zhou Shoujuan had several kinds of "Charming Eyes, Purple Orchid Flowers, Double Fish," etc., which were colorful and extremely beautiful. The Sun family of Meijing Lane had pearl fish such as "Golden Pearl, Silver Pearl, Red Pearl, Black Pearl." Xunyang's six- or seven-year-old Old Purple Pile Meat, Red Pile Meat, and Muyuan's Water Bubble were displayed together. The most numerous and best ones were naturally the precious goldfish specially transported from Shanghai's Yuele Kingdom Goldfish Group to Suzhou for exhibition. There were "Five-Colored Velvet Balls, Glass Emeralds, Black Dragons, Chai Luolan, Blue Sky White Sun, Golden Star Red Head Cover, Three Beauties, Gold and Silver Velvet Balls, Golden Star Phoenix Tail, Iron Face Loyal Heart," etc., all of which were precious varieties that Yuele Kingdom organizers Xie Tianliao and Wu Jiren had painstakingly managed to find after several years of hard work. Some were rare varieties from Jining, Shandong, some were specialties of Beijing and Tianjin, some were treasures of Jiangnan, and some were excellent products rarely seen locally that were found from Lanzhou. They were displayed inside, making the Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition a lot more beautiful. Looking around, the lively and beautiful goldfish swam in the glass tanks, making it extremely pleasing to the eye. No one who visited did not praise the Yuele Garden's goldfish as rare and precious varieties.</p>
<p>Shanghai Yuele Kingdom Goldfish Garden is located on Haig Road. All the goldfish are precious varieties rarely seen outside. It is well-organized and large-scale. Scientific methods are used to nourish the goldfish, which can make the goldfish last longer and not die. Moreover, in the future, people will be sent to the homes of people who buy Yuele Kingdom goldfish to raise them on their behalf, ensuring they can survive permanently. Soon, a retail store will be established in the mainland business district to make it convenient for customers to purchase. At the same time, a grand goldfish screening will be opened at the time of the opening of the retail store, displaying all the goldfish. The grand occasion at that time will surely be several times greater than that of Suzhou.</p>

<h3>(Things Mothers Should Know) Correcting Children's Bad Habits</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>(Thumb Sucking) Some mothers dote on their young children, and when they see their infants putting their thumbs in their mouths to suck and chew, they say things like, "Look at this little darling! Sucking on that cute thumb, doesn't it taste good, baby? Good baby!" They only see the fun and call it cute, but they never dream that this thumb-sucking habit is enough to harm their infant's health.</p>
<p>Thumb sucking causes the jaw (i.e., the upper and lower jaw) to work continuously. This constant movement is enough to give the infant a "long" face, which is very unattractive. Moreover, the continuous rubbing of the thumb's soft skin is enough to cause the new teeth to be pushed forward, become crooked, or even protrude, resulting in an ugly appearance. Infants with this habit often push their upper lip up to their nostrils, which hinders their breathing. There is also a greater danger: the small thumb brings many bacteria into the mouth.</p>
<p>If your child has already developed the habit of thumb-sucking, stop him quickly and correct him. It is unnecessary for the infant's mouth to work or move continuously. When the infant is teething, anything he bites or sucks on must be carefully checked to ensure it is absolutely clean before giving it to him, otherwise it will cause no small harm. In short, when raising your infant, you must take care of both doting and hygiene at the same time. Blindly indulging him, letting him suck his thumb or bite things, is not loving him, but harming him.</p>
<p>Fondness for Sweets</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is very common and normal for children to ask for sweets or candied fruits to eat. However, if this desire to eat sweets is caused by something else, or if they demand it willfully, then it cannot be considered normal and is entering an unnatural state. As for developing an addiction to sweets, that is harmful to the body and detrimental to health.</p>
<p>Many children develop this irregular and abnormal fondness for sweets due to unnatural upbringing and eating habits. By unnatural upbringing and eating habits, it means that the dishes they eat daily are not very balanced, not very healthy, not beneficial to hygiene, and harmful to the body. Children who grow up eating very natural foods can develop a normal satisfaction with food and will not have a great and wild craving for candied fruits and sweets. If a child's food is wrongly allocated and used to stimulate appetite, then he will develop a wrong demand for everything. All difficulties arise from this.</p>
<p>Another reason for developing this irregular and abnormal fondness for sweets is the lack of sufficient raw vegetables and raw fruits in the child's food. Every child should eat these raw things from an early age, and should almost grow up eating these things. An adequate amount of raw vegetables and raw fruits every day should be regarded as indispensable; we can borrow the saying "One cannot be without this gentleman for a day" as our motto for food allocation. Scallions, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, beetroots, cucumbers, celery, etc. can all produce a relieving effect on the fondness for sweets and can help in growing into a strong and healthy child with clean blood.</p>
<p>I know of a child whose fondness for sweets was cured by apples. The doctor told his mother to always have a lot of fresh apples at home, and whenever the child asked for sweets, give him a fresh apple and teach him to chew it. Soon the fondness for sweets was relieved, and the child's health was restored, his weight increased, and his intelligence improved. Before, he was a child with a very weak body, gradually declining intelligence, and was dull and slow. Apples cleaned his blood, corrected his irregular and abnormal fondness for sweets, and put his growth on the right track, making him a healthy person.</p>

<h3>My Views on the Most Important Work of the Tuberculosis Prevention Society (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Some time ago, Wu Zhihui, Ding Fubao, and others initiated a Pulmonary Pain Society. I don't know what its content is or what its nature is. However, I only knew from the newspaper that they had such an endeavor. Afterwards, the news disappeared, and I didn't know what happened in the end. I was quite concerned. At that time, I felt some emotion when I saw this name, and I couldn't help but question when I saw the list of initiators. Because the Pulmonary Pain Society is of course an academic group studying tuberculosis, the backbone figures and staff are not internal medicine tuberculosis experts. At least, they should be people who have a very good understanding of medicine to be able to organize, establish, develop, and succeed. However, most of their initiators are either important figures in the party-state or famous literati. I thought it must be a terminological illusion of preventing tuberculosis. Soon, I found in the newspaper that Mayor Wu and the financial tycoons and important figures of the party-state in Shanghai also initiated a Tuberculosis Prevention Society. I don't quite understand how it is organized. However, judging from the name, it is clearly of a preventive nature. Therefore, it is very good to gather people from all walks of life and work together. Because the Pulmonary Pain Society is the business of scholars, and the Tuberculosis Prevention Society is the business of society and the masses. Fundamentally and in nature, they are completely different. Speaking of the business of scholars, it is very shameful. Given the backwardness of medicine in our country, research is generally immature. I dare not say that there is no one in Qin who has a deep understanding of tuberculosis and strives to study it, but they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. So, it is not only difficult to take action on academic research issues at present, but it is simply impossible to talk about it. However, the prevention of tuberculosis, which is the business of society and the masses, is extremely urgent. Especially in the current Chinese society, which lacks production, is economically dilapidated, and has limited knowledge. Lack of production means insufficient material resources and inadequate equipment. Economic dilapidation means difficult living and easy occurrence of diseases. Limited knowledge means difficulty distinguishing between right and wrong and ignorance of avoiding danger. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the society and the masses in this situation are struggling for their lives in deep water and scorching heat. And Mayor Wu and a group of celebrities have felt this serious situation and bravely initiated this Tuberculosis Prevention Society. What a great undertaking!</p>
<p>I did not participate in this Tuberculosis Prevention Society that day. However, whether you are a doctor or a member of the public, it is necessary to participate and an obligation to support it. Here, I am not afraid to make a presumptuous contribution of a few words. It can be regarded as a humble offering or a杞人憂天. The spread of tuberculosis has long extended to the whole world, and countless people have been sacrificed by its poisoning. However, since the discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus, nearly forty years have passed. The efforts of medical scientists and the work of awakened countries are not weak or few. However, it is still spreading everywhere, and there is no good way to control and eradicate it. We can understand that the best way to deal with tuberculosis, because it has not yet been discovered, we have to prevent its spread. And the prevention of transmission is by no means something that can be achieved in one place, one region, one country, or one race. Now, all countries in the world are deeply aware of the difficulty of preventing the spread of diseases and have come to the conclusion that human cooperation is necessary. Therefore, in the past ten years, there have been numerous international disease societies and international disease prevention conferences. Therefore, there is also an organization for international tuberculosis prevention conferences in the field of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>International cooperation in preventing and eradicating diseases is originally the fundamental problem in solving infectious diseases today. However, international cooperation is a group effort between countries. Now that we have not organized preventive work within our own group, we certainly cannot talk about cooperating with others. However, the League of Nations is very concerned about our health undertakings and has given us special treatment by sending a highly esteemed health minister to plan our work for us. From the perspective of our medical community, it is certainly a touching act of human cooperation and mutual assistance. However, I dare not presumptuously guess whether there are any political relations involved.</p>
<h3>A Respectful Announcement to the Youth of Traditional Medicine Across the Country</h3>
<p>— Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>For several years, I have been studying traditional medicine books without any gains. However, learning to benefit the world is the consistent expectation of medical practitioners. My practice of medicine is not accidental. (I have been practicing medicine in my hometown of Wan Yuan, Anhui for more than a year. In terms of business development, it can be compared with local middle-class doctors. This is not boasting. People in Wan Yuan can say it. This can reassure me to accept my fate and sit back and enjoy my reputation. Although my relatives and friends all expect me to do so, my purpose is quite different. Treating one day of illness brings one more day of worry. I am always fearful and uneasy. It is not that I cannot cure the disease. It is that the absurd theories and strange ideas in traditional medicine are enough to make me doubt, enough to bind my wisdom, and even enough to make me fall into a fog, wandering and unable to see through? Because, of those I have treated, nine out of ten I do not know what caused the disease? How does the disease cause death? And how does the medicine work? Although I am not smart, how dare I shamelessly place myself in the traditional medicine community, discussing disease origins, disease pathology, differentiating wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, distinguishing between Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang, deceiving myself and others, and causing myself pain? I recognize the lessons of reality and the modern environment. I dare not deceive the common people and sit and sink. Therefore, I resolutely decided to leave the old nest and learn new medicine. What I am saying now is not because I have received a little scientific baptism, or because I have been anesthetized by new medicine, recklessly discussing right and wrong, and wantonly enjoying myself. I am sincerely afraid that my talented young people and dedicated scholars will mistakenly enter a lost path and be unable to redeem themselves, sharing the same sorrow as me. Therefore, I exhaust my knowledge and respectfully announce to the youth of my traditional medicine community that they should follow the requirements of the times, accept the lessons of reality, awaken suddenly, and embrace science. I offer my past experience as a warning for all!</p>
<p>(1) Recognize the Trend of the Times</p>
<p>The present era is the scientific era of the 20th century. Science is the key for mankind to seek happiness. The degree of scientific development and the amount of happiness enjoyed by mankind are two parallel lines developing in the same direction. European and American countries, as well as neighboring Japan, have made amazing strides in scientific development! The people of those countries have largely enjoyed the happiness of material civilization. The achievements of medical prevention are clear. Since the recent invention of bacteriology, smallpox and cholera have been eradicated in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. Harvard Medical School students cannot find a single patient with typhoid fever for diagnosis and treatment during their internships. This shows that health administration in these reformed countries can be handled so perfectly. This is truly the grace of science. Therefore, the mortality rate in European and American countries has recently been reduced to about 15 per thousand (e.g., the mortality rate in the United Kingdom is 12-13 per thousand, and the mortality rate in Japan is about 15-17 per thousand). Looking back at our country, it is still mired in the remnants of 19th-century culture, hesitating and not moving forward. Even in large cities, there is no complete scientific health administration. The high mortality rate is about 30 per thousand, almost equal to that of India, a quasi-colony. People have already rushed forward, and I can only chase after them and not catch up. Thinking about it, how can I not feel ashamed? Although, the fact that Chinese politics has not been put on track is not necessarily the only reason. However, my talented young people are the lifeline of the country. How can they let the good times slip away, devote themselves to the old medicine of building cars behind closed doors, and willingly be crushed by the wheels of the times? Those who live here must recognize the trend of the times and must not hesitate and be indecisive, but from fragmentary observations, think that the treatment achievements of traditional medicine are still better than new medicine, or can be destroyed, and devote themselves to research, I dare to ask how can it be done if all the intelligence is used up, but there is no scientific brain? If there is no scientific knowledge, you still think about sorting out traditional medicine and making traditional medicine scientific. Is this already going into a dead end? How can there be hope of getting ahead?</p>
<p>(2) Recognize the Theories of New and Old Medicine</p>
<p>What are the theories of old medicine? A quick look at the historical records will reveal that they are still metaphysical products from ancient and medieval times, and have never evolved. Although old medicine surpassed Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, and India in the previous century, leading the world's medical field for more than 4,000 years until today, it has already reached the end of its road, unable to bear the feeling of vicissitudes. Here is an example to prove the backwardness of old medicine.</p>
<p>In our country, the earliest and most complete discussion of the etiology of old medicine is found in Ling Shu. Chao's Treatise on the Origins of Diseases only shows trivial skills. Its basic theories are the theory of the five movements and six qi, yin and yang, the theory of the three causes of disease, the transmission of the six meridians, the theory of earth, water, fire, and wind, the theory of focusing on fire, phlegm, clearing and attacking, regulating the spleen and stomach, and attacking blood stasis, and the theory of the triple burner. Bad habits and chronic diseases, biases and prejudices, how can they overflow the scope of Ling Shu, only to see the spread of fallacies, the rehash of empty theories, firmly adhere to ancient precepts, and the branching vines grow daily, with no originality, no invention, as it was in ancient times, as it was in medieval times, and so it is in the scientific era of the 20th century.</p>
<p>New medicine is different. In ancient times when culture was not developed, the causes of diseases were also conjectured based on experience and a firm belief in gods and ghosts, such as the mischief of ghosts and gods and the bad weather. Later, it gradually progressed, using scientific methods and the power of machinery, following the inevitable path of human knowledge evolution, from theology to metaphysics, from white metaphysics to quasi-science. Taking the pathology alone as an example, such as from the study of liquid diseases to the pathology of blood diseases, to the pathology of solid diseases, to the pathology of neurological diseases, to the pathology of cell diseases, in the process, it has undergone successive transformations and evolutions before becoming today's great achievement. Since the recent invention of microscopic science, the future of new medicine is becoming more and more brilliant! It is not like the old medicine, which is inherited from each other without paying attention to reality.</p>
<p>Comparing the two, the theories of old medicine have become historical relics. In today's era of scientific prosperity, we adopt the strengths of others and follow in their footsteps, still fearing that we will not succeed. But we still regard Ling Shu as a secret treasure, cherishing it as if it were a broken broom, and painstakingly studying old medicine, but unwilling to let go. Is this acceptable? I do not mean that old medicine should not be sorted out. This is just to reveal the hidden virtues and obscure lights of the ancients and fight for a place in the medical history of ancient, medieval, and modern times. As for saying that the old sayings of old medicine can be carried forward, that is, can promote the progress of scientific medicine, and illuminate the universe, it is just a fool's dream.</p>
<p>(3) Recognize the Therapeutic Achievements of New and Old Medicine</p>
<p>The treatment methods of old medicine include 按，，鍼，砭，湯液，祝由，…… Although various methods are available, their inventors are all ancient sages and worthies. Today's people only know how to use their established methods. There are even those who abandon ancient methods and dare not use them, and cannot use them, such as Hua Tuo's technique of dissecting the abdomen and cutting the intestines. Are there still people in today's old medicine community who can perform this technique? It is beyond doubt that old medicine is declining day by day! New medicine is different. The ancient doctors could not perform the technique of cutting the abdomen and cutting the intestines. Today's new doctors can do it, and the precision of their surgery is even better than Hua Tuo's wonderful skills. The degree of progress cannot be measured. This is a clear sign of the evolution of new medicine, which is beyond the reach of old medicine and makes people sigh with admiration. Moreover, some say that when the January 28th Incident occurred, brave soldiers galloped on the battlefield, and the wounded from knives and guns were only seen being rescued by new doctors. No old doctor ever lifted a finger. In such a great national war, how could the scholars who claim to protect the national quintessence bear to stand idly by? Is it not that they are helpless? The achievements in the treatment of other external injuries can also be seen.</p>
<p>As for the above-mentioned examples, they are probably just minor skills that new medicine specializes in surgery. The specialty of old medicine is internal medicine, because the four limbs and hundreds of bones of the human body, the movement of qi, is intricate and complex, to the most subtle and wonderful extent, how can new medicine be able to see it? Is it really as they say? I say: No. New medicine has been introduced into our country for less than 60 years. The first new doctors to serve in society were only a few doctors from foreign missionary hospitals, or a few nurses, pharmacists, assistants, and staff who temporarily acted as doctors. With the level of education and ability of nurses, etc., it is difficult to be competent to perform the skills of a doctor. It is rare for them to treat internal diseases without failure. It is appropriate for old medicine to be praised for its expertise in treating internal medicine for a while. Today, it is different. Taking Shanghai as an example, today's new doctors who specialize in internal medicine in Shanghai are like bamboo shoots after a rain, and have been recognized by society. Diseases that old medicine cannot treat, such as meningitis, new medicine can treat. Diseases that old medicine does not recognize, such as relapsing fever, new medicine can recognize. These are all very superficial examples. From this, one can see a glimpse of the new and old medical treatment techniques for internal medicine.</p>
<p>New medicine can not only treat diseases, but also prevent diseases. After the cholera epidemic in Shanghai in 1927, the health authorities paid attention to prevention. Is there still a cholera epidemic this summer? Its preventive achievements can be imagined. Therefore, in remote places such as Shanxi and Gan</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Su and other places, there is no new medical and health equipment, and there is a plague epidemic. From this, the treatment ability of old medicine is more and more weak. The more and more evidence that it is not too step-by-step, my young people, should be aware of it? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Common Knowledge of Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(18) Epidemic Parotitis (Mumps)</p>
<p>(Parotitis epidemica, Mumps)</p>
<p>Q What is epidemic parotitis?</p>
<p>A It is a disease in which the parotid gland (the gland under the ear) is infected with bacteria and inflamed.</p>
<p>Q What is the common name for this disease?</p>
<p>A There are many common names: the dialects vary from place to place. Northerners call it "Big Ear Wind" or "Lining Ear Wind"; some places call it cheek swelling; Ningbo people call it "Big Mouth"; in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, some people call it "Pig Head Plague"; and some call it "Mumps."</p>
<p>Q What is the cause of epidemic parotitis?</p>
<p>A It is probably a kind of bacteria; but it is not clear what kind of bacteria it is.</p>
<p>Q Does it occur at a fixed time?</p>
<p>A Yes. It often spreads at one time, or sporadically in various places.</p>
<p>Q How does it spread?</p>
<p>A It is spread from the patient's healthy body through contact with droplets of saliva. Because the parotid gland is a gland that secretes saliva, and the excretory opening is in the oral cavity, the bacteria and saliva can be spread together in the air, and then enter the cheek from the mouth of a healthy person.</p>
<p>Q After being infected, how many days does it take to get sick?</p>
<p>A It takes one to three weeks of incubation period to get sick.</p>
<p>Q Are there any prodromal symptoms when the disease occurs?</p>
<p>A Most have no prodromal symptoms; some have a mild fever for two or three days.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms at the beginning of the disease?</p>
<p>A There are loss of appetite, fatigue, discomfort, etc.</p>
<p>Q What about later?</p>
<p>A Later, one side of the parotid gland swells, and after two or three days, it invades the other side of the parotid gland. The skin of the affected area becomes red, tense, shiny, and there is a feeling of heat, pain, and tenderness.</p>
<p>Q If the inflammation progresses, what will happen?</p>
<p>A If the inflammation progresses, it will gradually spread to the surrounding tissues, causing inability to chew and swallow, and often there is an unpleasant bad breath. In addition, there are submandibular gland and sublingual gland swelling at the same time.</p>
<p>Q How many degrees is the fever? About how many days does it take for the fever to subside?</p>
<p>A The average fever is around 38-39 degrees Celsius. The fever subsides after four or five days.</p>
<p>Q Does epidemic parotitis have complications?</p>
<p>A In men, there are complications of orchitis and epididymitis; in women, there are oophoritis or mastitis. In addition, there are meningitis, facial nerve paralysis, otitis media, acute endocarditis, acute nephritis, or measles.</p>
<p>Q Are there any sequelae after the illness?</p>
<p>A There are sequelae such as testicular atrophy and chronic parotid gland swelling, and hearing impairment.</p>
<p>Q How many days does the entire course of this epidemic parotitis take?</p>
<p>A The entire course takes about seven to ten days.</p>
<p>Q What is the prognosis?</p>
<p>A All are good.</p>
<p>Q What is the treatment?</p>
<p>A Use disinfectant mouthwash to clean the mouth four or five times a day. Apply anti-inflammatory and analgesic ointment to the area. Or apply fish stone soft tone, iodoform soft tone, etc. Or apply water bags and cold wet cloths, etc. For the testicular area, use a testicular support belt, or cold compress, ice bag, etc.</p>

<p>Looking at the above official and private publications of Materia Medica throughout history, up to the modern *Compendium of Materia Medica*, it can be called the culmination. The *Compendium* is based on the *Classified Materia Medica* and compiled from it. Its classification method already roughly outlines the classification of botany, so it can be a great reference for researchers of modern pharmacognosy. However, it is wrong to take Shi Zhen's book as the standard for studying pharmacognosy. Now, if we want to make the old Materia Medica scientific and evolve it into a new pharmacognosy, we must read widely and thoroughly study the theories of the *Compendium* through field research. Those who bear the weight of this research are our responsibility.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Meningitis</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>Definition of Meningitis: Meningitis is a disease of the meninges and brain, which are the masters of our entire body. Inflammation of the meninges causes the entire body to lose its regulation, the mind becomes confused, perception is disturbed, and movement is disordered. The condition is like wind and comes on very suddenly. In the past, people did not understand anatomy and all thought it was caused by fright, so it was formerly called "fright wind." In reality, wind and fright are both irrelevant.</p>
<p>Meningitis is a general term for inflammation of the meninges. If it is caused by various pyogenic bacteria, it is called pyogenic meningitis; if it is caused by tubercle bacilli, it is called tuberculous meningitis. But the most acute is caused by meningococcal bacteria. Often, the bacteria spread, causing a major epidemic. Throughout history, countless lives have been sacrificed to it, so it is called epidemic meningitis. However, when medical scientists perform autopsies, they examine the affected areas and find that the inflammation is not limited to the meninges, but often involves the membranes of the spinal cord. Therefore, it is also called epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis.</p>
<p>Epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis is rarely recorded in ancient Chinese medical books, and is probably not a disease native to China. Old doctors generally refer to acute and chronic infantile convulsions, which are mostly pyogenic meningitis or tuberculous meningitis. These cases are relatively rare and never spread into epidemics. However, the epidemic type is uniquely capable of causing epidemics and prevailing for a time, so the general public commonly refers to this when they talk about meningitis. What is covered in this article is limited to epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis.</p>
<p>The Pathogen of Meningitis: The pathogen of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis is the meningococcal bacteria, which was discovered by the medical philosopher Weichselbaum in 1887 AD. If you take the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient and examine it under a microscope after staining, you will often see diplococci standing side by side, similar in morphology to gonococci. Most of them reside within pus cells and leukocytes, so they are also called intracellular meningococcal bacteria.</p>
<p>This bacteria thrives best in densely populated, humid, and unsanitary places, so it occurs mostly in rural farmhouses, barracks, factories, prisons, etc. However, its resistance to the outside world is weak, and epidemics are often limited to small areas. Moreover, patients are scattered in various places and do not cluster in one corner. The age of onset is most common in children and infants under ten years old, and is very rare for those over forty. As for the epidemic period, it is generally during the cold winter and spring months, but it is also occasionally discovered in the autumn, or it may spread for a long time and not stop in all seasons.</p>
<p>The Route of Transmission of Meningitis: The transmission of this disease is usually through the nasal and pharyngeal secretions of patients, which contain the bacteria. When coughing or sneezing, they spread outside the body and are transmitted to people directly or indirectly. It first invades the mouth, nose, pharynx, tonsils, middle ear, etc., and then reaches the subarachnoid space via the lymphatic or blood vessels. Then, it attacks the meninges and spinal cord, causing inflammation. Those who are physically and mentally overworked, drink alcohol, have a cold, have an unhealthy lifestyle, have a head injury, or have a lymphatic constitution are most susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>It is common for people with special constitutions to be invaded by the bacteria, which parasitize and reproduce, but they themselves do not get sick. However, they can spread the bacteria and act as a medium for infection. In medicine, these are called disease carriers. According to reports from medical philosophers Bruns and Hohn, they examined the families of 330 patients with epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and found that 162 people had bacteria in their nasopharynx but did not get sick. These disease carriers have a great impact on the epidemic. Furthermore, some people who have recovered from the disease can continue to excrete the bacteria for several weeks or months after the illness, and also serve as a medium for transmission.</p>
<p>The Pathology of Meningitis: When meningococcal bacteria invade the meninges, inflammation occurs. At this time, a fibrinous and purulent fluid seeps out between the arachnoid and pia mater. The inflammation initially only reaches the base of the brain near the optic chiasm, and then progresses to the vault of the cerebrum and cerebellum. The posterior half of the spinal cord also undergoes the same changes. Subsequently, it invades the surface of the cerebrum and spinal cord along the blood vessels, affecting the optic nerve and the root of the auditory nerve, and then multiple abscesses occur in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, after the disease is cured, it often leaves sequelae such as cortical defects or chronic cerebral edema.</p>
<p>In addition, the pharynx and tonsils are the gateways for bacterial invasion, and often become congested, swollen, and suppurated, causing inflammation. If the meningeal purulent phenomenon progresses along the nerves, the sphenoid sinus, eyes, and ears often become purulent. If the virus damages various organs of the body, it can also be complicated by endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, pleurisy, arthritis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, cystopyelitis, and other symptoms.

<h3>Genius and Courage</h3>
<p>— Boyuan</p>
<p>I happened to get up quite early and found a nice sunny day. After breakfast, before office hours, I followed the fashion and took a Western-bound book to the park to "read." When I opened it, I realized I had grabbed the wrong book. It was a collection of essays on writers by a "great master" from Northern Europe.</p>
<p>But let's read on.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the first sentence of the first essay was "surprising writing": a genius must also have courage. The next five or six lines (very much like parallel sentences in our ancient Chinese prose) elaborated on how one must be courageous, "courageous in self-confidence." Confident in what? Confident in one's own path of imagination and method of expression. In other words, the subject matter must be new, and the form must also be creatively new; patience is required when searching for it, and hard work is required when creating it, and in the middle of searching and creating, one must be "courageous in self-confidence."</p>
<p>This great master of criticism was Georg Brandes, who was very "authoritative" more than thirty years ago. Looking at it now, his arguments are no longer valid: the few sentences quoted above are not really that surprising. But I admire him for one thing: this critic does not put on airs. Reading his book does not make you feel "panic" like reading the great works of other critics, as if you were standing in front of a teacher reciting a book as a child.</p>
<p>And he has many arguments that still seem applicable even today, such as the few sentences quoted above. The so-called "creative experience" is, in principle, nothing more than these few sentences.</p>
<p>But the writers in our "literary world" have "selectively quoted" Brandes' advice. That is, they happily accept "courage in self-confidence" and return "patience" and "hard work." There are also those who have adopted Brandes' words in reverse. That is, they have courage first, and then "genius." There are even those who combine the two into one. These, for the most part, first publish a few works, and then add a title of some kind to themselves, "courageously" calling themselves "stubborn supporters" of this school.</p>
<p>The "kingdom" of art and literature should originally be "free." What's more, it is said that literary giants are originally "agreed upon."</p>
<h3>Hairnet</h3>
<p>— He Jiahai</p>
<p>"When you earn money, you must buy me a hairnet!"</p>
<p>Every time I went home and saw my second aunt, she would always say this to me.</p>
<p>"Of course, and I'll buy you a silk one."</p>
<p>"Don't be so wasteful, a thread one will do, I'm not a young girl丨丨"</p>
<p>"Then I can buy one for you now."</p>
<p>"No, no, wait until you earn money!"</p>
<p>She gently refused, saying that she would never spend a penny of my money when I was unable to earn a living. Then, she told the story of the hairnet in detail. She said that when I was about eight years old, one day my father went to the city, and I insisted on going with him, but he wouldn't let me. Naturally, I cried and made a fuss, crying from upstairs to downstairs, and rolling and jumping on the floor, under the table, and beside the stairs, clinging to him and not letting go. He took one step, and I followed one step, crying and whimpering and actually following him to the riverbank. My father's temper was even more stubborn than mine; he wanted it that way, so he did it that way. He heard me crying and knew I was running after him, but he didn't say a word and just shouted for the ferry to take him across. He didn't even look back once halfway across. Suffering this coldness, I was especially sad and simply rolled around on the beach, covered in mud.</p>
<p>"What did you look like then?"</p>
<p>"I don't remember."</p>
<p>"Humph, just like a bull! Think about it丨丨" she said with a smile, "You were only eight years old then, but you were so strong that I couldn't hold you down no matter what. I dragged you out of the mud and wanted to pick you up, but you used all your strength to kick and twist me, tearing my hairnet, which I had used for several years and brought from my mother's, to pieces, leaving me disheveled as I went home. You really had a big temper back then丨丨"</p>
<p>"Was that hairnet very durable?"</p>
<p>"Very durable. The one you buy me in the future must be just as durable."</p>
<p>She laughed happily, giggling, patting my shoulder and touching my hair, as if I were still a child.</p>
<p>"I'll buy you one now."</p>
<p>"No, no, it must be after you earn money."</p>
<p>"What if I never earn money?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, a child like you丨丨"</p>
<p>"People all say I have a poor destiny."</p>
<p>"Don't listen to those ghosts, I guarantee you'll have your day丨"</p>
<p>She said it so resolutely, so definitely, believing that I would definitely be able to start a family and build a career, just like my father, my friends, and everyone else related to me believed that I had a bright future. Their hopes were all placed on me, living in a kind of vague expectation. How could they know my hardships, my loneliness? How could this kind, honest old woman know?</p>
<p>"I really will never earn money!"</p>
<p>I always wanted to say this to her, but when I saw her absolutely trusting eyes, I swallowed the words again.</p>
<p>Now I have been in society for a long time, and apart from constant worries, I have no other hopes. I used to dream of earning money, but it has long since become a bubble. I have been away from my hometown for five years, and naturally the news of my second aunt is also vague. I often think about buying her a hairnet, but when will her hopes for me be realized?</p>
<p>"When you earn money, you must buy me a hairnet!"</p>
<p>In endless melancholy, I seem to often hear this gentle, kind instruction.</p>
<h3>Horse Carriage</h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>On a bitterly cold night, on the lonely sidewalk, apart from three or four dim lights emitting faint light, there was only an empty horse carriage walking along.</p>
<p>The coachman sat on the carriage, wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket. Yellow-brown broken cotton could be seen from the sleeve he used to crack the whip. He whistled in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Clip-clop! Clip-clop! Clip-clop!"</p>
<p>The horse's hooves stepped on the lonely road, passed through a cobblestone street, and stopped under a red electric light.</p>
<p>"Horse carriage, horse carriage, do you want a ride, sir? To Xiaguan!" The carter's voice was like a muted bell.</p>
<p>The pedestrian walked forward, step by step, his neck shrunk into the hard collar of his coat, without responding.</p>
<p>"Bad luck, the weather is terribly cold, the carriage is empty, and my stomach is also empty!" The carter shuffled his feet, as if venting his anger on the bell, and as if getting some comfort from the sound of the bell.</p>
<p>The horse carriage has become a legacy of the old society, and is being eliminated day by day, but in this ancient capital, there are still countless people who cannot live without horse carriages. But their business is being snatched away by cars and rickshaws. So, on this bitterly cold night, on the deserted road, the carter shrank back, raged, shuffled his feet, cracked his whip, and hunger and depression were tormenting his heart.</p>
<p>The horse carriage passed through the street center, passed through the spooky street center. There were almost no pedestrians left, only occasionally seeing one or two vendors selling glutinous rice balls. The horse dragged its feet wearily, the slow steps echoing on the road with a dong-dong sound.</p>
<p>The empty-stomached horse dragged the empty-stomached carter and the empty-stomached horse carriage, dead-weightedly patrolling the black night road.</p>
<h3>Outside the Theme</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shu</p>
<p>丨丨Justification and Statement Regarding the Opium War</p>
<p>In the Free Talk section, there has been discussion about the source of "The First European Flag" (also known as "The Opium War"). I have read the several short articles published intermittently. Originally, I should have made a "statement" or a "defense": but in the end, I thought that since the play had attracted attention, then the review of the content's value and the correction of my clumsy translation should be pointed out by those who care. Now, instead of doing this, they are wildly and meaninglessly focusing their arrows on a single person's name, which is unnecessary. Although the original manuscript by Murayama is indeed on my desk, I still feel that accepting the fault of being "uninformed" is not a very serious matter. Therefore, although I saw those words, I still remained silent. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sun Bo's explanation was published, and I thought the matter was over.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a certain newspaper on the 16th published another article that was good at scolding people but afraid of being scolded, and was still talking incoherently. This time, it really made it hard for me to endure. For the sake of facts, I must frankly express something. For the general newspaper reader, it is still a meaningless thing.</p>
<p>First, the statement that the one referring to "Jusheng" is me and that I wanted to promote myself with these words is untrue. I deny this slander, which does not harm me.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Jusheng spent a great deal of effort to single me out, but as a result, he outsmarted himself. This is what makes me most regretful. A name is only a "symbol" of a person. It is only a personal matter. I hope that those who are as busy as Mr. Jusheng will not need to be so diligent in paying attention in the future.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Gaoming is an acquaintance I have met. I reflect that my "acquaintanceship" with him, which could not even be called "as light as water," has not caused me any grievances, but he actually wrote these words with such anger. While I am baffled, I am indeed saddened for him that he has no way to condemn himself. Why is it necessary to make up ridicule and scolding towards those with whom you have no feud, in order to boast about yourself, but instead reveal your ultimate embarrassment? If he is a "literary man," he should write more meaningful articles.</p>
<p>Fourth, the play "The Opium War" is about the bloody history of imperialists trampling on and poisoning the Chinese nation. Its historical significance and value are no less than "Roar, China!" However, my translation is not very smooth and fluent; I hope someone can re-translate it once. I am willing to have my manuscript destroyed.</p>
<p>Fifth, someone (absolutely not me) is in the process of adapting this play into a screenplay. I hope people can review the original work, or express opinions on various aspects of the play. So as not to bury the original author Murayama's painstaking efforts; and it is also a duty that Chinese artists or playwrights should fulfill.</p>
<p>What I want to express is only these things that are outside the proper theme. As for the matter of "degeneracy," that is another matter. Born in the vast world, existence and annihilation are only momentary phenomena. Who can determine his life and life behavior and not "be like an insect"? What I cannot tolerate is the unprovoked malice that is thrown at me for the sake of writing.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (34)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>They raised the foresail, started the anchor winch, and the ship became free, slowly gliding towards the embankment in the calm water near the pier. The faint breath emanating from the street imperceptibly warmed the sail, and the Pearl, as if enlivened with its own spirit, the ship's spirit, was propelled by a mysterious force hidden within it. Pierre gripped the tiller, a cigar in his mouth, his legs stretched out on the stool in front of him, his eyes half-closed in the dazzling sunlight, watching the tarred timbers on the breakwater pass beside him.</p>
<p>As they reached the end of the northern embankment that enclosed them, as they sailed into the open sea, the cooler sea breeze felt like a slightly cold caress on the doctor's face and hands; it blew into his chest; he opened his chest, taking a deep breath, as if to absorb it; this cool sea breeze also billowed the brown sail into a round shape, making the head of the "Pearl" dip down, and its body became more agile.</p>
<p>Jeanba suddenly raised the jib, the triangular thing pregnant with wind, like a wing, then he strode two steps back and untied the stern mast wrapped around the mast.</p>
<p>So the fishing boat leaned sideways and sped away at full speed, the water boiling and rushing backwards making a soft and exciting sound.</p>
<p>The bow of the ship parted the sea, like a mad plow, and the waves plowed up, gentle and filled with white foam, formed a round pile and fell down again, like the brown, heavy ploughed earth falling down.</p>
<p>Every time it encountered a wave, 丨丨these waves were short and close together, 丨丨the Pearl was shaken from the tip of the jib to the rudder, and the rudder trembled in Pierre's hands; sometimes the wind blew even stronger, and the sea water smelled the side of the boat, as if to invade inside. A Liverpool coal steamer. Anchored, waiting for the tide to enter the port; Pierre and Papagri circled around from behind, then visited the ships anchored outside the port one by one, then sailed a little further, in order to gradually view the coast.</p>
<p>Pierre wandered peacefully and happily on the rippling sea for three hours, manipulating this thing made of wood and cloth like riding a fast and obedient winged beast, as long as he gripped it tightly, it would move freely according to his will.</p>
<p>He dreamed, just as people contemplate on horseback or on the deck of a ship, he thought of his brilliant future, he thought of the joy of living by his own talents. Tomorrow he would advance fifteen hundred francs to his brother for a period of three months. So that he could immediately move into the beautiful house on François I Street to open his practice.</p>
<p>The sailor suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Pierre, look, the fog is rising, we should go back."</p>

<h3>Economic Relations Between the United States and Russia</h3>
<p>— Wei Qi</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor of Litvinov's arrival in Washington to negotiate the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia with President Roosevelt (Editor's note: the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia was realized the day before yesterday), I think it would not be entirely useless to introduce the past economic relations between the United States and Russia to the people of the country! Because in the past sixteen years, the main reason why the United States did not recognize Soviet Russia was actually economic issues, and the so-called political issues of the national system were nothing more than a concern as to whether recognizing Soviet Russia would benefit the American economy. And now the reason why President Roosevelt abandoned his past policy and sent a letter to Kalinin requesting to send a representative to negotiate recognition is precisely because since the autumn of 1929, the United States and the entire capitalist world have fallen into the abyss of panic and cannot escape (although after various efforts); especially since the United States has vigorously implemented the recovery movement, domestic industry has been stimulated by speculation and prices have risen, and factories have shown signs of recovery; but the goods actually produced have not directly flowed into the hands of consumers, and are still滞積 in warehouses. Since September, this stimulus has gradually disappeared its effect, and has returned to the path of decline. Therefore, in order to save this crisis and escape the panic, President Roosevelt had to quickly proceed with the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia in order to obtain the vast Soviet Russian market. Therefore, a correct understanding of the past economic relations between the United States and Russia can not only help us understand the current issue of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, but also help us predict the future trend of the world. But unfortunately, information about the economic relations between the United States and Russia is very scarce, and the limited space of this publication does not allow for detailed theoretical inferences, so I hope readers will forgive any shortcomings.</p>
<h3>(1) Debt Relations Between the United States and Russia</h3>
<p>The US-Russian debt mentioned here refers to the debts that the United States and Americans lent to the Tsarist government and the Kerensky government before the Russian Revolution, and which were declared invalid by the Soviet Russian government on February 8, 1918 by decree. Everyone knows that these debts are one of the main reasons why the United States has refused to recognize Soviet Russia for sixteen years (On August 10, 1920, US Secretary of State Colby stated that the real reason why the United States could not recognize the Soviet Russian government was that the Soviet Russian government did not recognize debts and insisted on sponsoring the expansion of communist revolution throughout the world; in December 1923, US President Coolidge also declared in a message to Congress that the United States did not propose to "establish relations" with another government that did not recognize the sanctity of international obligations. A few days after the message was issued, the Moscow government telegraphed the US government, stating that the Soviet Russian government was willing to negotiate all existing issues between the two countries with the United States on the principle of non-interference, and Secretary of State Hughes replied that there was no reason to hold negotiations: "If the Soviet Russian authorities are prepared to restore the property of confiscated American citizens or make effective compensation, negotiations can be held." But what is the total amount and content of these debts? According to a hint from a Soviet Russian personage in 1925 hoping for American recognition, the formal statement of American demands on Russia is as follows: (This statement was officially prepared for the current affairs magazine)</p>
<p>(1) Requirements of the U.S. government (see the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury, page 49 of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925).</p>
<p>(A) Total principal of unsecured contractual debt: US$187,729,750.00.</p>
<p>(B) Sales of military supplies surplus on July 9, 1928 US$406,082.00.</p>
<p>(C) Liabilities obtained for A.R.A. (contract of February 25, 1919): US$4,465,465.00.</p>
<p>Total principal: US$192,601,297.00.</p>
<p>(2) Russian bonds owned by U.S. citizens (Federal Reserve Citizen Report, August 1922, page 393).</p>
<p>(A) US$25 million, 5 and 1/2 percent, five-year Treasury bonds (issued in November 1916; due December 1, 1921. Principal and interest should be paid in gold coins in New York, USA. Semi-annual interest payments due December 1, 1919, and never fulfilled): US$25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>(B) US$50 million, 6 and 1/2 percent, three-year short-term bonds, due July 10, 1919 (interest should be paid in gold coins in the United States. This type of bond is a direct foreign debt of the Russian government) US$50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>(C) Domestic 5 and 1/2 percent, 1916 ruble bonds (the total number issued reached 2 billion rubles, and it is not very clear how many were sold in the United States. This type of bond can be recovered in rubles in Russia, so the market price of the bond in the United States depends entirely on the exchange rate of the ruble): US$75,000,000.00.</p>
<p>(3) Other requirements</p>
<p>Estimated: US$400,000,000.00.</p>
<p>(Note) The interest on the first item, up to October 15, 1924, totaled US$58,782,129.70. Interest must also be added to the total amount of the second and third requirements.</p>
<p>According to the decree promulgated by the Soviet Russian government on February 8, 1918, these debts were said to be used to oppress workers, so they were not recognized; however, if the United States insisted on repayment, the Soviet Russian government would propose compensation for the losses suffered by the Soviet Russian Union in the intervention incidents of 1918-1920 to offset it.</p>
<p>As for the period after the Russian Revolution, due to the United States' non-recognition of the Soviet Russian government, there was naturally little debt relationship to speak of. All there was was short-term credit lending in trade relations. But these loans were very small; and they were never delayed. This was not only the case for Soviet Russia with the United States, which did not recognize it, but also for all other countries with which it had diplomatic relations. In the current situation where debt reliance has become a world epidemic and delayed debt payments are a common phenomenon, the credit of the Soviet Russian government is of special significance, and has at least become a form of confidence for the United States to recognize Soviet Russia.</p>
<h3>(2) Trade Relations Between the United States and Russia</h3>
<p>In the past sixteen years, there has been a contradictory phenomenon in US-Russian relations, that is, on the one hand, because the United States does not recognize Soviet Russia and the anti-Soviet Russian movement, the trade between the two countries cannot develop rapidly, but on the other hand, it is precisely because of these developments that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is hindered, that is, "trade development does not rely on recognition or "pure diplomatic relations." The United States is very clear about the vast market of Soviet Russia; but the particularity of Soviet Russian politics makes the United States concerned about whether trade can be protected after recognition. First, because "The Soviet government monopolizes foreign trade, using a system of import and export donations to expand strict supervision over the import of all goods or the export of domestic goods, which is different from the trading methods commonly practiced in various countries, so past commercial experience and training are completely worthless and must be abandoned. If a foreign firm sells to or buys from Russia or the Soviet government from one of its many agency stores, this transaction must be conducted in accordance with the policies ordered by Moscow. For example, American cotton is purchased by an agent store of the Soviet Union in New York, the funds are paid from Moscow, loaded onto semi-Soviet ships, and transported to a Russian commercial port. Although this method has "the highest credit", centralized responsibility, the ability to buy and sell in large quantities, and the benefits of various needs and supplies, because the operation of this method crosses the borders of many countries, the foreign firm cannot escort his goods, cannot claim rights, cannot investigate the final use of the goods transported, cannot choose his purchases, correct sales or loading, or obtain compensation in the event of errors." (The US government's spokesperson in 1925 "denied the formal reasons for the Soviet statement") Second, because the main thing that Soviet Russia buys abroad, in addition to a few raw materials, is machinery for domestic production. And Soviet Russia is a socialist country in the process of construction, so trading with Russia is actually indirectly supporting its own enemies (the opinion of general critics who oppose the recognition of Soviet Russia). Therefore, from Wilson to Hoover, the government adopted a consistent policy of neither having formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Russian government, but not prohibiting trade between the two countries and not opposing American businessmen from lending to the Soviet Russian government. And American businessmen and industrialists, because they do not have the active protection of the government, like Germany, the government designates funds to guarantee the credit of Soviet Russian promissory notes and accept mortgages of Soviet Russian orders (when American businessmen ask private companies to discount promissory notes, they usually get a 25% to 30% discount), so long-term credit sales are rare. In 1929, General Electric Company and the Soviet Russian government entered into an agreement containing partial five-year loans, which was almost shocking when it was announced. Thirteen-month loans were also considered long-term loans. Even so, the trade between the United States and Russia is still constantly developing forward. According to the data released by Amtorg Trading Corporation, the commercial hub representing the Soviet Russian government in the United States, the US exports to Russia in 1929-1930 were nearly 150 million US dollars, far exceeding those of other countries exporting to Russia, accounting for 26% of the total imports of Soviet Russia (in recent years, about half of Soviet Russia's foreign trade has been contested by Germany, Britain, and the United States; in 1929-1930 (calendar year), Germany's exports were 234.31 million gold rubles, Britain's were 78.9 million gold rubles, and the United States' were 280.3 million gold rubles), on the other hand, Soviet Russia's exports to the United States also have a gradual increasing tendency. The trade volume between the United States and Russia since 1913 and 1923-1924 (the actual sales and purchases of the Soviet Russian Amtorg Trading Corporation in the United States since 1927-1928) is listed below: (Unit: US dollars)</p>

<p>1929丨30 31,017,050 149,222,700</p>
<p>The main commodities exported from the United States to Soviet Russia are agricultural machinery and implements, especially tractors and their parts, industrial machinery, cotton, etc. The main commodities exported from Soviet Russia to the United States are furs, lumber, manganese, pig bristles, fish (including caviar), anthracite, etc. At present, most of the trade between the United States and Russia is conducted in New York by Amtorg Trading Corporation, Centrosoyus America, Selkhozsoyus America and Holla Raciantex Stal New嘉特(mainly manages cotton). In addition, there are also some American companies (such as Standard Oil C &amp; · of New York, Eitingon-Schild Co"</p>
<p>Lena Goldfield Co”Allied American Corporation, Russian American Compressed Gas Co, etc.) have signed special contracts with the Soviet Russian government for direct trade.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for readers to understand, the detailed content of US-Russian trade in 1929-1930 (from October 1 to September 30 of the following year, the Soviet Russian fiscal year), the proportion of American-exported machinery in total exports in recent years, and the comparison with various countries are shown in the table below:</p>

<p>Japan 115 41 5,253 793</p>
<p>From the above tables, it can be seen that the trade between the United States and Russia was increasing year by year up to 1930 (although it did not occupy an important position in the total imports and exports of the two countries); but since 1931, it has decreased significantly. According to statistics from the US Customs: In 1931, the US exported goods worth US$103,669,000 to Soviet Russia, and Soviet Russia exported goods worth US$13,206,000 to the US. In 1932, the US exported goods worth US$12,466,490 to Soviet Russia (a decrease of about 90% compared to 1930), and Soviet Russia exported goods worth US$9,096,885 to the US. This sharp decline is due to the general decline in foreign trade of the two countries (in 1932, the total foreign exports of the United States decreased by US$161.7 million compared to 1931, a decrease of about 33%, and imports decreased by US$132.3 million, a decrease of 37%; in 1932, the total foreign trade of Soviet Russia was 1.8384 billion rubles, a decrease of 77.944 million rubles compared to 1.91624 million rubles in 1931); but on the other hand, it is due to the anti-Russian movement in the United States, the restriction on exports to Russia, and Germany's regaining of Soviet Russian orders (in 1931, Soviet Russian orders in Germany increased by 62.3% compared to 1930).</p>
<p>Regarding the anti-Russian movement in the United States that is directly related to the trade between the two countries, the most important is the anti-Russian dumping and the anti-forced labor movement since 1930. In these movements, the US Treasury Secretary has repeatedly made it difficult for paper-making materials, coal, manganese and other commodities carried from Soviet Russia to land, and formulated prohibitions on the import of products produced by forced or indentured labor (Forced orlndentured laber) in accordance with Article 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>
<p>Although the United States has been like this, Soviet Russia has not changed its policies. In addition to trade, it has also signed contracts with about 50 manufacturing and technical companies in the United States to attract American technicians and a large number of skilled workers.</p>
<p>In the past sixteen years, investment has been very small in the economic relations between the United States and Russia, apart from trade. For example, the Horrimau manganese mine and the Lena gold mine concession can only be regarded as an exception. This is because investment capital is not as easy to recover as trade capital; unless it receives government protection and support, capitalists in general are unwilling to take risks. Therefore, the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia will undoubtedly have a great impact on the economies of the two countries.</p>
<h3>(3) Prospects for US-Russian Relations and the World Economy After the Resumption of Diplomatic Ties</h3>
<p>According to dispatches from Washington over the past few days, if no unexpected problems arise during the negotiations between Roosevelt and Litvinov, the United States recognizing the Moscow government is a foregone conclusion. But what impact will the resumption of diplomatic ties between the US and Russia have on the two countries and the world economy? Due to space constraints, a theoretical discussion cannot be undertaken, so only a very general principle will be outlined.</p>
<p>First, after the United States recognizes the Soviet Russian government and establishes a trade agreement, trade between the two countries will inevitably increase. This will certainly enable the smooth implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan on the Soviet Russian side. Because Soviet Russia has had a very large excess of imports over the years, and the loans for goods purchased on credit from foreign countries will also gradually become due (700,000,000 to 800,000,000 marks will be repaid to German creditors in 1933), increasing exports and obtaining new credit will not only greatly aid national finances, but also regulate the domestic economy. But what about the United States? Increased exports may invigorate domestic industry and commerce (especially heavy industry and the cotton sector in agriculture), reduce unemployment, and to some extent help Roosevelt's recovery plan; but this is just a temporary shot in the arm. Since the panic, the amount of goods held by the United States has been very large, and factory closures and unemployment are unprecedented; therefore, obtaining an organized and planned Soviet Russian market cannot revive dying capitalism. As for using recognition to massively invest the dead capital into Soviet Russia, this is only a hope. Of course, the Soviet Russian government does not reject large-scale investment in Soviet Russia; but it must be carried out under its laws and supervision. Therefore, capitalist countries and capitalists generally believe that investing in Soviet Russia means less benefit for themselves and more benefit for the Soviet Russian side, and they are reluctant to move forward. This can be seen from the lack of enthusiasm for investment in Soviet Russia by capitalist countries that have established formal diplomatic relations with it. Since the United States is a capitalist country, it is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>Second, what impact will US recognition of Soviet Russia have on the world economy? People generally have great hopes for this issue, believing that the United States recognizing Soviet Russia can revive the declining world economy. I think this is a superficial observation. Why? Because the cause of the current world panic is not due to the United States not obtaining the Soviet Russian market, but due to the inherent corruption of capitalism. It is true that the US and Russia are both members of the world economy, and the vigorous development of the US and Russian economies will have an impact on the world economy; but this impact is very slight, and we have already argued above that the United States cannot achieve prosperity simply by recognizing Soviet Russia. Therefore, hoping to revive the world economy through US recognition of Soviet Russia is a dream. 22, 11, 15,</p>
<h3>This Year's Shanghai Banking Industry</h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an</p>
<p>Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and banks are the pivot of finance. They manage surpluses and make up for deficits, bringing prosperity to all. Whether their operations are well-managed or not has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. At this time of economic decline and widespread poverty, if we want to explore the truth of the national economy, we can observe it through the banking business. Therefore, the state of the industry in the past few months of this year is worthy of our observation.</p>
<p>In the past ten months, the Shanghai banking industry, although burdened by the aftermath of last year's Shanghai war, has appeared outwardly active. More than a dozen new banks have been established, including Hua'an, Da Hu, Wu Hua, Zhi Zhong, and Hui Zhong. There are even more banks currently being prepared to open. Only two banks, Minxin Bank and Huatong Bank, have announced liquidation. At first glance, it seems to present a flourishing atmosphere. However, upon closer examination, the morbidity still seems unavoidable.</p>
<p>(1) Abundance of Idle Capital: Since the end of the Shanghai War last year, the phenomenon of domestic cash concentrating in Shanghai for the sake of safety has become increasingly apparent. As of the end of July this year, the city had a total of 275,480,000 silver dollars and 140,792,000 taels of silver, an increase of 10% compared to the end of last year and more than double the amount at the end of December 1920. Because of political instability and the decline of industry and commerce, banks are afraid to invest in real enterprises to promote their development. They sit on huge amounts of capital, waste interest, and feel deeply troubled by their inability to absorb it. Therefore, some bankers use it to buy and sell government bonds to earn considerable profits. Those with greater ambitions are planning to invest in rural areas to improve the rural economy. However, rural areas are vast and farmers are scattered. If we want to cultivate their ability to use bank funds, we must first train them and promote the organization of cooperatives. But this is a difficult task that cannot be accomplished overnight.</p>
<p>(2) Rise of New Banks: The number of new banks established this year, from January to the end of October, totals fifteen or sixteen. The market situation is deteriorating day by day, but the number of peers has suddenly increased. What could be more abnormal than this? Extending the analysis, competition is imminent, and decline is approaching. Considering the motives of various entrepreneurs in establishing banks, most of them aim to support real industries and develop the national economy, but the number of those who plan to use depositors' funds for speculative trading is probably not small. Those with more sensitive ideas who have been devoted to the money shop business are also investing in the establishment of banks to reserve a foothold for the day when money shops are eliminated. This spirit of keeping up with the trend, innovating, and reforming is certainly commendable. However, is it not an over-concern that people with outdated ideas are handling a business that is rich in academic theory, and the result is like trying to paint a tiger but ending up with something that resembles a dog or a horse?</p>
<p>(3) Trend Towards Speculation: Banks gain the trust of depositors and manage their deposits on their behalf. It is a legitimate business to use a portion of these funds for trading in securities or real estate. However, if a large portion of the funds is used as a shortcut to speculation, it is inevitable that it will be criticized for abnormal development. This year, due to the many troubles of the times, the investment channels of various banks have become increasingly narrow. They have the will to help those in need, but no way to do so. In the end, most of them abandon their inherent business and tend towards speculation. There is an excess of profit-seeking but a lack of prudence. Once an unexpected change occurs and the market price plummets, the losses will certainly not be limited to a small number of shareholders.</p>
<p>In summary, the important mission borne by the banking industry is such, and the transformation of its business is such. If there is even a slight flaw, who can say for sure that it will not repeat the mistakes of the Xin Jiao crisis? Reflecting on the past and being vigilant about the future, we cannot help but feel apprehensive. Although the wrong path has not been taken far, the future can still be pursued. We in the financial community occupy an important position in the economic sphere. Why not take measures to make up for past mistakes and prepare for unforeseen circumstances? In recent years, bank mergers have been common in Europe and the United States, concentrating strength, improving efficiency, and the benefits are not to be ignored. Therefore, for the present plan, the newly established banks with meager capital in our country in recent years should gradually merge, unite in spirit, and advance together. Is this also a way to remedy the current crisis?</p>

<h3>The Bond Market Last Week: A Time of Rain and Storms - Market Prices Totter Under Political Rumors and High Pressure - Mostly Falling by About One to Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Last week, from November 13th to 18th, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced turbulent market conditions with sharp declines. The bond environment was inherently weak due to the central government's financial difficulties, and the frequent political rumors caused shocks, resulting in fluctuations and a precarious situation. Since the news of the Min Province coup came, people have become even more uneasy, and speculative discussions have arisen, causing market prices to plummet. I have said before that the market transaction volume is too large, and any new force joining will inevitably cause a major storm. Last week's surge of sellers, the heat of speculation, and the weakness of retail investors forced many bulls to cut their losses. However, the buyers were also quite powerful. Throughout the week, the demand for Issue No. 4 was the largest, while Issues No. 21 and 33 were the most sold. Most of these long and short positions were new transactions. The fact that the market did not crash was largely due to the buying power of Issue No. 4. Currently, the transaction volume is increasing, and the trading period for this month is becoming shorter, seemingly reaching extremes. The barriers are very high, and once they shake, the waves will be dangerous. The situation this week will be even more tense, and new trading should be approached with caution. On Monday, those with inside information knew that the situation in Min Province was about to change, and Issues No. 1, 5, and 14 were sold, but Issues No. 4, 16, and 77 were bought, and competition was fierce, but prices still fell by about half a yuan. On Tuesday, retail investors bought in, and the market rebounded strongly in the morning. After the close in the afternoon, news of the Min Province coup came, and the bulls fled, and speculation led to wild selling, with prices plummeting by one to one and a half yuan or more. The future of market prices has since become troublesome. On Wednesday, knowing that the news was not as serious as rumored, retail investors slightly covered their shorts, and Issue No. 4 continued to buy, and market prices rebounded slightly by three to five jiao. On Thursday, rumors spread that Mr. Hu had entered Min Province, and the market trended downward throughout the day. Because Issue No. 4 temporarily stopped buying, the impact was particularly significant, and market prices plummeted by several jiao to one or two yuan. The market situation became even more uncontrollable. On Friday, the first session saw a short-covering rebound of about one yuan, but rumors flared up again in the second session, leading to a sharp drop of more than one yuan. Trading was extraordinarily active. Only one session was held in the afternoon, and market prices fell again by several jiao to one yuan. On Saturday, due to the easing of the situation in Min Province, the market opened with a sharp rise of several jiao to one yuan and three or four jiao, but the rise was too rapid, resulting in no further upward momentum, and the second session saw a slight retracement of five or six jiao. Only one session was still held in the afternoon, and the situation was chaotic, and rumors continued unabated. It is a common tactic for shorts in the market to spread rumors, but the real reason is that people's hearts are too vulnerable and easily affected. In fact, sellers are not only speculators and retail investors, but the amount sold by large investors is also considerable, which is the most reason for some people not to be optimistic. As a result of the week's market prices, most fell by about one yuan to two yuan. The brewing of the Min situation, whether it must explode or, even after it explodes, cannot be eliminated, actually has little to do with the bond market itself. This rise and fall is half caused by speculators and half due to the fact that large investors have sold but not yet recovered. Therefore, there may still be a major reversal this week. The total transaction volume was 127,717,900 yuan, including 16,900 yuan for spot goods and 49,530,000 yuan for futures (including salt tax), 19,820,000 yuan for disarmament, 15,660,000 yuan for the 19th Customs, 25,280,000 yuan for the 20th Roll and 20th Customs, and the remaining amounts ranging from over 600,000 to 2-3 million yuan.

<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Becomes Cheaper as it Falls - ▲A Phenomenon Inevitable When New Oil is Produced▲</h3>
<p>Since the new white tung oil came into production, the market has gradually loosened. However, the prices of foreign firms in Hankou are still relatively high. The largest sale last week was over 25 yuan and 7 jiao per dan, but recently it has gradually fallen to 25 yuan and 2-3 jiao, with the lowest being 24 yuan and 8 jiao. According to the details in yesterday's Hankou letter, it was 25 yuan, all of which were foreign-standard gross prices. The total number of transactions over the past few days was about 3-400 tons, and it seems to have stabilized again. Moreover, the number of Xiang Tung and Southern Branch oils opened into Hankou was also 2-3000 dan, with prices still at 20 yuan and 4-5 jiao to 20 yuan per dan. Brokerage prices were at 19 yuan and 7-8 jiao. When the new oil first appeared, there were no major signs of a decline. However, the production of new oil in Zhejiang Province was earlier, and the trend of dumping was also more prevalent, and the market price fell more than in Hankou. The dumping price was only 20 yuan per shih at the Jiangjiao exchange. Although the settlement of accounts was relatively late, the current oil has been greatly affected by it and has to gradually decline to connect with futures. Recently, the spot price has only sold for slightly more than 21 yuan, and the decline can already be generally seen. Moreover, the inventory of Hangzhou firms has been emptied, and they want to use this to go short to facilitate the purchase of goods, so it is not easy to have hopes for a turnaround in the market for a while.</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Rice Market Shows Signs of Weakening</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of supply from various gangs continue to be strong, with more than 70 ships arriving, carrying approximately 8-9,000 shih of goods, of which late rice still accounts for the majority, approximately 6,000 shih. The wholesale by both the Northern and Southern Ocean gangs is smooth, only slightly inferior on weekends. However, the quantity is still 3-4,000 packages, and the market appears quite lively. However, on this occasion when new goods are launched, there is sometimes a feeling of oversupply. Moreover, the current supply is continuous, which inevitably affects the market, and the price is difficult to maintain. In addition to the price reduction, sales in the shops on this street are also less than yesterday. As a result, the market situation has become weak again. Changbang, Sutongbang, Nangang and other japonica rice have fallen by several fen to about 1 jiao. Du Yang's fine goods are still firm due to lack of supply, but the price of Yinyuan rice has softened slightly.</p>

<h3>On University Students Kidnapping</h3>
<p>— Cunren</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, students were sometimes referred to as "Qiu Jiu," because at that time, their eagerness to solicit donations for disaster relief resembled the aggressiveness of soldiers on the battlefield, but they were not soldiers, hence the term "Qiu Jiu." When Peng Yunyi was the Minister of Education, students were also called "Xue Fei" (student bandits), because the elders and gentlemen thought their instigation of student unrest was as disruptive as bandits harassing the countryside, but they were not bandits, hence the term "Xue Fei." Both "Qiu Jiu" and "Xue Fei" were slanderous and disrespectful terms for students. The emergence of the latter term, "Xue Fei," coincided with the time when Mr. Lu Xun and others were fighting against Peng Yunyi, which Mr. Lu Xun and others used as a pretext to defend the students and attack Peng Yunyi.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that there would actually be real "Xue Fei" today, university students committing kidnapping!</p>
<p>And who would have thought that these kidnapping university students would actually appear in Beijing (now called Beiping)!</p>
<p>However, the university students' kidnapping did not target the wealthy and powerful, but rather their own classmates within the school. The reason is naturally that the classmates were the children of wealthy merchants and powerful officials, equally as good as walking cash cows. Nevertheless, classmates kidnapping classmates also provides a topic for casual conversation. Perhaps this wisdom comes from the game of hide-and-seek played in elementary school? In the game of hide-and-seek, a classmate's eyes are covered with a towel, and they are told to grope in the dark. Similarly, kidnapping involves tying up a classmate and placing them in a dark place where they cannot be free, letting them ponder where they have been taken.</p>
<p>University students kidnapping, those who worry about the times sigh and say: Education is bankrupt.</p>
<p>In fact, the purpose of China's current education is to produce batches of graduates to become unemployed in society. It is not surprising that some of the unemployed become kidnappers; therefore, it can be said with some justification that its purpose is to produce kidnappers. Then, according to my logic above, university students kidnapping means that China's current education has achieved its goal and is not bankrupt.</p>
<p>However, even though it can be said that way, it must be said back again. University students becoming kidnappers has little to do with education; it is the bankruptcy of the national economy, the flaws in the social system, the poor becoming poorer, and the rich becoming richer, leading to a desperate act by the poor to survive. Taking the Beiping case as an example, if those university students who became kidnappers were not economically oppressed, they would definitely be able to study peacefully and dream their beautiful dreams after graduation, and would never willingly commit illegal and bandit acts.</p>
<p>Perhaps some will say that they are not the only university students suffering from economic oppression. Why don't others become kidnappers, but they do? This is also a question worth studying.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is that since they have become desperate, it doesn't matter which path they take, it is all for survival under economic pressure. People suffering from the same economic oppression, some dare not resist society and endure the pain, while others deny everything under the social system and fight back. This is what the ancient saying means: the weak are buried in ditches, and the strong take risks. The difference lies in the strength or weakness.</p>
<p>However, in this turbulent era, there are many people who take risks, and it is not necessarily the case that all those who take risks only go down the path of becoming kidnappers. Those university students should be rebuked for this, not for the former.</p>
<p>It should also be added that taking the path of becoming a traitor, a bandit, etc., is the same as taking the path of becoming a kidnapper.</p>
<h3>"Little Horse Dies for its Master"</h3>
<p>— Yema</p>
<p>The first time I watched films about wild animals imported to our country from Europe and America, I simply couldn't believe that those things really happened. Gradually, I heard people say that those fierce wild animals were trained by people before they could gather together, obey human commands, and perform. This time, the Haijingbo Circus came to Shanghai, and according to friends who had seen it, the troupe had a large number of fierce lions, tigers, and black bears, all of whom could perform. After hearing this, I had long made up my mind to go and see it, but later I didn't manage to buy a ticket several times, and I still haven't seen it, feeling as if something is missing in my heart.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, this newspaper carried a news item about the circus, roughly stating: Mr. Kraibai of the troupe died of diabetes in the hospital, and a small horse, unable to see its master return, eventually stopped eating and died in the veterinary hospital.</p>
<p>Stories of animals dying for their masters have been read a lot in many chivalrous old novels, but I have never heard of such facts actually happening. This news report can probably be verified as true, so it has triggered many thoughts in me.</p>
<p>When some experienced gentlemen know this, they will surely shake their heads and feel that "people are not as good as beasts." However, I feel that this view is still irrelevant and an absurd sermon. The indelible mark that this matter has left on my mind is not because I think this "little horse" is admirable for starving to death for its master, because encouraging people in this way is tantamount to wanting to enslave everyone into countless useless and pitiful creatures (it is impossible to even talk of a despicable individual hero!). Regarding this matter, we should study it from the point of "why did the little horse die for its master?", and in the relationship between this "little horse" and its master, there must be a kind of "force" linking them, and this "force" can prompt this "little horse" to die for its master. With such a study, we will discover the only "benevolence" and "sympathy" in the world that can create everything! The "force" of "benevolence" and "sympathy" is incredibly great. If there is no such "force" between the "little horse" and its master, at least, we can say that the "death" would not necessarily happen: if it did happen, we would necessarily admit that the "death" was accidental, a coincidence, and there is fundamentally no relationship between the two. Furthermore, the same goes for wild animals such as lions, tigers, and black bears. They are by nature fierce and violent things. Ordinary people rarely have hope of survival when they encounter them. However, the fact is that they have undergone special training by a certain type of person, and they can actually work together to perform. This is absolutely not an accidental stroke of luck, nor is it the kind of incomprehensible nonsense that can be explained in old novels about gods and monsters, where these people are sent by the "Jade Emperor" to tame lions and tigers, or what is known as "Taming Tiger Stars." They are also ordinary people, and their fists are just as incapable of fighting against the iron claws and sharp teeth of fierce lions and tigers, and they are just as likely to be brutally killed or devoured by them! But they finally tamed the fierce lions and tigers to accept their training, listen to their commands, and perform for them. This means that between them and them, there is a "force" that is so great as to be inconceivable and that can create everything! This "force" is "sympathy" and "benevolence." It not only serves as the driving force to tame them but is also a major factor in enabling them to cooperate and be friendly with each other. The verification in the public speech by the head of the circus at the Xueyi Society shows that what is said here is not wrong.</p>
<p>Here, we get a very great and powerful lesson: the modern era is indeed a cruel, dog-eat-dog, robber world, where everything is indiscriminate. However, if you want to truly conquer something or rule a nation, it is not enough to rely on brute force alone, and the result will inevitably be failure and emptiness. Look: when pastoral peoples raise their small livestock, they always use whips and threats to subdue them. Although they do not have the ability to resist (actually, that is not entirely true), they will run away as soon as they have the opportunity. Why do they want to run away? They are also their "masters," so why don't they show the expression of "dying for their masters"? If they were raising lions, tigers, and black bears, would they be subdued by their whips and threats in the same way? ... Therefore, we know that in any situation, when doing anything, in addition to brute force, which cannot be relied upon, we need the vast power that exists invisibly, the incredibly great "sympathy" and "benevolence"!</p>
<h3>True Cottage Jottings</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>Inadvertently, in a book, I saw these few sentences: "Japanese people, no matter what they do, do it solemnly, seriously, properly, and tensely. Chinese people, any action and behavior is mostly done playfully, frivolously, romantically, and laxly." Alas! In these simple few sentences, it symbolizes one is: a strong nation that opens up territory, makes achievements, and is enterprising. One is: a weak nation that loses territory, is decadent, and does not prosper! Therefore, the loss of the four eastern provinces cannot be said to be the fault of the "non-resistance general" alone!</p>
<p>Chinese people are hypocritical throughout their lives. When they are alive, their business cards are printed with a long list of titles. When they die, their obituaries are also published with a string of experiences.</p>
<p>Among men, nine out of ten, before getting engaged, the first condition is to inquire about the woman's appearance. Among women, also nine out of ten, before getting engaged, the first condition is to inquire about whether the man's family is rich or not: knowledge, temperament, and character are secondary. Therefore, after getting married, when the woman's beauty fades, the man wants to abandon her. When the man's money is exhausted, the woman wants to divorce him. "The wife dies, and the children don't care; the husband dies, and no one comes." Seeing the lively funeral of a wife of a certain Shanghai playboy recently, and the desolation after the death of Chen Tong in Hong Kong, one gets a powerful understanding of these two proverbs.</p>
<p>"Wealthy incense chases people with eight feet, people chase wealthy incense but cannot catch up." Everyone always remembers these two proverbs in their hearts, and windfall lives like "aviation lottery tickets" can plummet.</p>
<p>Since "September 18th" the year before last, the Japanese invaders occupied our three eastern provinces and then came to seize our Rehe. Before long, they were also eyeing North China. Their ambitions are great, and their desires are extravagant, which fits the Chinese proverb: "Advance without limit!"</p>
<p>The love of uneducated shepherd boys in remote villages is true and hopeful, but the love of the times is.</p>
<p>Chinese people say: Japanese people are good at defense, but lack creativity, they are like monkeys. However, the Japanese are also saying: Chinese people, don't even mention creativity, they can't even imitate, they only know how to enjoy what is ready-made! They are like a gluttonous and lazy sleeping pig! Alas! Then, compatriots, do you still want to be self-righteous?</p>
<p>To inquire about school news and affairs, you can find it on the walls of school toilets. To know the scandalous secrets of mansions, just pay attention to the conversations of the maids next to the stove.</p>
<p>The two people who used aviation lottery tickets worth 500,000 yuan as the topic for their articles, I guess they must have also bought lottery tickets themselves, dreaming of a 500,000 yuan gold dream, otherwise, they would never complain for no reason.</p>
<p>"One day without food is hungry, three days without food is sick, seven days without food is death!" Since Mahatma Gandhi invented the great new contribution of fasting for forty days, these few sentences have been fundamentally broken.</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Binfu</p>
<p>One: The Death of Mr. ×</p>
<p>The death of my teacher, Mr. ×, gave me the opportunity to return home. At that time, I had been separated from my hometown for more than half a year. Returning home was naturally a joyful thing for me, but this time the joy was completely replaced by the sadness of mourning.</p>
<p>In the faint morning light, I rushed from the wharf to Mr. ×'s residence. Mr. × was already lying stiff in the middle hall, and cold silence filled the surroundings of this passionate man. I couldn't help but feel sorrowful.</p>
<p>He was a person of strong personality, which was even more evident in his death. He truly sacrificed himself for his personality.</p>
<p>The origin of his illness was a year ago. At that time, after examination by several of his friends who were Western doctors, it was believed to be early-stage tuberculosis. However, he, who was confident and had some medical knowledge, believed that he would never get lung disease. He relied on the instructions in "Yan Fang Xin Bian" (Newly Compiled Tested Prescriptions), believing that his illness was entirely due to "internal evil consolidation and excessive liver fire," and that as long as he could "ventilate the evil and remove the fire," he could "eliminate all diseases." Therefore, he invited the famous "National Doctor" Mr. So-and-so to see him. Mr. So-and-so put three fingers on his pulse and also determined that it was definitely not tuberculosis but "internal stagnation of dampness." He clapped his hands in agreement and, at the same time, scolded those friends who were Western doctors.</p>
<p>Although his spirit recovered slightly after taking the "National Medicine" of Mr. "National Doctor," his illness was accelerating, because he had a special love for wine.</p>
<p>Several friends who were Western doctors often warned him, and several friends with a little scientific knowledge also often advised him. His answer was only these words:</p>
<p>"You are all eating foreign farts, closing your mouths about lung disease and opening your mouths about T.B. Go and read more Inner Classics and Tested Prescriptions. Don't make a fuss and talk nonsense anymore. Look, my illness is getting better day by day. If I had been treated by you Western doctors earlier, I would have been scared to death or troubled to death!"</p>
<p>However, according to the photos taken by a certain Western doctor using X-rays and the results of examining his sputum, tuberculosis was indeed progressing very rapidly in his body.</p>
<p>Friends were worried about him, Mr. "National Doctor" was "replenishing his internal and external," "removing dampness and calming his liver," and he was praising the brilliance of "National Medicine," and time passed like this until he died.</p>
<p>In the few days when he was most seriously ill, Mr. "National Doctor" became anxious and even brought a "stethoscope" to "listen" carefully to him and also "looked" at the sputum under the microscope. He shook his head and said, "It is indeed T.B.C. There is no way!" Finally, he wrote on the pulse case the mysterious and profound conclusion: "...human effort has been exhausted, so ask for divine help" and left.</p>
<p>Mr. × thus sacrificed himself for his beliefs.</p>
<p>I paced around Mr. ×'s body, and I felt extremely sad, and at the same time, I felt extremely angry.</p>
<h3>Burning Cloth to Treat Illness</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>In the criticism of national arts in this magazine's Tan Yan Guoshu on the 14th, there is the sentence "Teacher Xiao's Burning Cloth to Treat Illness," which is probably not as common as the 63rd generation Zhang Tianshi carrying the life tablet and precious sword to the Great World to draw talismans to eliminate disasters." The author, a week ago, accompanied relatives from the countryside to admire it, but it seems to be a pity that I didn't write a "Teacher Xiao's Interview Record." Now, with the "God has the virtue of loving life," I will write it down to "save all sentient beings," hoping that the beggars on the road with rotting legs who cannot run, and the blind people who can only learn to be fortune tellers, will all be treated by Teacher Xiao's burning cloth, then the compatriots are fortunate, and China is fortunate! The author thanks Mr. Lizhai here for reminding me.</p>
<p>My relatives told me that they saw an advertisement for a Spiritual Philosophy ×× Society for treating illnesses on a small newspaper, which can treat various difficult and complicated diseases without spending a penny. Although there are still self-deceiving terms like "sincerity is the key" at the bottom, my relatives are precisely worshipers of "sincerity is the key." He has been ill for more than ten years, and everything from fortune telling to burning incense and making wishes, even kneeling and kowtowing, has been "sincere." However, it has never been "effective," so he discovered a new "medical technique" of burning cloth to treat illnesses and "sincerely" rushed to Shanghai from afar to taste the taste of this burning.</p>
<p>I accompanied him by car according to the address on that small newspaper. It was a large house with two entrances. Passing through the courtyard, there was a very large living room. According to the market rent, Teacher Xiao probably had tens of thousands of fortunes to come to Shanghai to help patients. At that time, I thought my friend was really unfortunate. He had a very serious illness before this teacher came to Shanghai, and the burden of all the medical expenses has not been paid off yet. Otherwise, by spending one yuan and a few cents to buy two lengths of cloth, burning it, swallowing it, he would have been light and healthy, and free from illness.</p>
<p>The registration office was divided into two sides, one male and one female. Many "sincere" "male and female devotees" sat quietly, waiting for them. The male was probably Teacher Xiao, and the female, I don't know if she was the teacher's wife, held a Taoist yellow paper used for "stepping on the table," that is, the kind with "Snake Ming Five Treasures Seal to ward off evil spirits," etc., and drew talismans and chanted spells on a large incense burner in the center. The sincere friend of mine closed his eyes tightly and sat opposite the doctor. Then the doctor waved that yellow paper in circles in the swirling smoke and then acted on the patient's head in the same way. Treating legs, treating what, and so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>My relative has had stomach problems for more than ten years. He can't eat too much, and he will feel bloated when he eats, and he can't eat too little, and he will feel hungry when he eats too little. Of course, our teacher ordered my relative to close his eyes tightly, and then that yellow paper was waved in circles in front of his abdomen. This kind of spiritual therapy method is indeed convenient. I wonder if doctors like Niu Huilin know that there are teachers in Shanghai who are grabbing his job without spending a penny, would he ask the Medical Association to hold a meeting to discuss ways to stop it?</p>
<p>After the spiritual treatment was completed, he gave my relative two stacks of yellow paper, one stack to be swallowed with boiled water before going to bed, and one stack to be tied around his abdomen when sleeping (because it was for treating stomach problems). And he said that this was an old illness 丨 This can show the teacher's magic, he knows that my relative's stomach problem is an old illness 丨 Since you have run from the countryside from afar, take more medicine back with you, and tomorrow buy two lengths of cloth, burn the ashes, and then swallow them every day. The teacher is so considerate of the patients.</p>
<p>In the corner on the right, there was a large iron pot. A junior teacher, perhaps? Was using pliers to clamp the small pieces of cloth that had been torn into squares and squares and put them on the fire to burn. The ashes that were burned down were the panacea. There was also an old woman who had been blind for three years being treated there. I blessed her to meet such a magically skilled teacher so that she could open her eyes and see how much Shanghai had changed in three years, at least to stroll around the Great World and watch "The Civet Cat for the Crown Prince" and not live in vain for so many years.</p>
<p>This interview record doesn't have that many words, and I myself have been trying my best to exaggerate the publicity: Fortunately, the teacher's spiritual treatment is free, otherwise, I would seem to be suspected of receiving a lot of fees from the teacher, so I specifically stated that I only met the teacher once, and I didn't say a word. Heaven is above, if there is half a false word, may I be struck by lightning.</p>
<p>However, my relative took so many "elixirs" back, and there has been no letter to this day that the old illness has been slightly healed. Could it be that he is not "sincere" when he comes from the countryside from hundreds of miles away? I think he is a worshiper of "sincerity is the key" and will never have made such a mistake.</p>

<h3>Older Sister is Getting Married</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Today, the tailor came and tied up all the new clothes for my sister, who is about to become a bride, five pieces per bundle, with red velvet rope and placed them in the new suitcase. I ran to the bedroom upstairs and saw the wardrobes and suitcases where my sister used to put her clothes, all half-open and half-covered, scattered and messy: the things downstairs were also placed in a mess. Yes, my sister is getting married. My mother is often shedding tears for my sister's marriage, but my sister, on the other hand, has an irrepressible smile hanging on the corner of her mouth. From her expression, you can see the joy in her heart. Ah! My sister is getting married. In her joy, we all feel some sadness of separation. On a quiet evening, a clear and miserable voice shouting in the cold streets and alleys, "Sandalwood olive, sell olives yo..." echoed in our eardrums, and my mother always said sadly under the dim light, with crystal tears hanging in the corners of her eyes: "Mother and daughters and sisters who have been together for more than 20 years will be separated once and for all."</p>
<p>My sister's marriage was arranged by her parents and the matchmaker's words. The man's request was to not use a sedan chair and hold a "new-style wedding" ceremony. My mother stubbornly refused, saying, "This is only once in a child's life, and she wants glory and auspiciousness. She must sit in a sedan chair. The new ceremony is too trivial, and relatives and friends will laugh at her." She also said, "In fact, according to the recent situation, this so-called "new-style wedding" only eliminates kowtowing to the "ascending" and replaces it with three bows, and the so-called "groom's robe suit" is replaced with a Western-style tuxedo and top hat, and the bride's phoenix crown and robes are replaced with a light gauze that is more than ten feet long. What else is new, what else is improved?"</p>
<p>Due to my mother's disapproval, it is certain that my sister must sit in a sedan chair and hold an old-fashioned wedding. So I began to anticipate that some very strange and incomprehensible things would soon be staged again. According to our hometown wedding customs, whatever you do, you have to choose an auspicious day before you can do it with peace of mind; for the major event of marriage, that is even more undoubtedly the case. On the eve of the period, the man's family has to "xiang xian" (?) in the middle of the night, and the woman's mother has to "cry good words (?)" at this time. It is said that if the man's family's cannon and the woman's mother's first cry of "good words" correspond, then the two families will definitely make a fortune: you must sit in the sedan chair, this is only once in a lifetime! When the bride sits in the cage-like sedan chair, she must cry out, otherwise, the bride's father and elder brother will be unlucky. The shoes that the bride wears to the man's house must not step on the dust of her mother's house, this dust is gold! When "worshipping the hall," the groom must place the "worship mat" one step higher than the bride's, and when the bride covers her head, ask a blessed lady to "invite a square scarf (?)" and beat it harder, meaning that the bride can be afraid of anyone in the groom's family in the future. The pigs and sheep used in the man's family's "xiang xian" are signs of future births of children, if the mouths of the pigs and sheep are open, they will give birth to boys, and if they are closed, they will give birth to girls. When entering the room on the first night, the groom has to close the door, and the next day the door is opened by the woman. On the first night, it is best for the two newlyweds not to speak, so it is said that life will be peaceful in the future; if they want to speak, everything they say must be auspicious...</p>
<p>For my sister's marriage, my mother is busy with a sad tune all day long; my sister is always silent, with a happy and victorious smile hanging on the corner of her mouth.</p>

<h3>Memories of Childhood Fragments (9)</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Born with a hard fate, conceived in the womb of a peasant woman. Although my father studied books all his life, farming was ultimately his lifelong occupation. After my eldest brother attended a foreign school, he learned many frivolous habits, always dragging his long gown, running east and west in the village, which annoyed my father, who often sighed. My mother, however, was quite tolerant, constantly comforting my father, saying, "Let him mess around!" These words clearly contained a full measure of sighing.</p>
<p>Between July and August, the farming work is the busiest. So, although my fourth brother is still young and his build is still so small, he cannot be compared to last year. Last year, when it was time to harvest rice, he was still carefree. Except for the two times of herding cattle in the morning and evening, this year, my father actually gave him an adult's job – harvesting rice. Therefore, he could not attend to herding the cattle. Who should be entrusted with the task of herding the cattle became a major problem for the whole family. Hiring someone would be too expensive. It would require providing one and a half liters of rice for food each day, and vegetables would be extra. Some wages would also be needed. So, my father said no to hiring someone, and my mother agreed. Herding cattle ultimately became a problem.</p>
<p>I knew long ago that this job had a tendency to fall on my head, since it was decided not to hire someone else to herd. Thinking of this, I could not help but frown, feeling that the evening task was not so hard to bear. Only in the dim morning light would I have to leave behind my sweet dreams, leading a cow, treading on the damp dew-covered ground to go to the fields. That was such a lonely and boring thing!</p>
<p>However, the situation had become such a stalemate. What could be done?</p>
<p>Just after lunch, I was practicing writing at the dining table in the kitchen. My mother, carrying a bucket of water, passed in front of me, stopped, and called my name:</p>
<p>"Starting tomorrow, your responsibility will be heavier! Fourth brother will go to the fields to harvest rice tomorrow. The job of herding the cattle is yours! You must be obedient, feed the cattle fat, so that we can rely on them for winter plowing!"</p>
<p>"Mom, I won't go in the morning. The evening shift is okay!" I put down my pen and held the paper, saying:</p>
<p>"In the morning, I'll wake you up earlier. The air in the fields is especially fresh in the morning. Even just going outside for a walk is good, let alone doing something proper, which is herding the cattle! It's precisely in the morning that you should go. Don't be silly!" My mother's kind smile overruled all my protests.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom will definitely wake me up tomorrow morning!" I agreed to herding the cattle even in the morning, but in my heart, I was still a little unwilling.</p>
<p>"Of course, I always wake up very early every day. I will definitely call you tomorrow!" my mother said, and then walked away to wash the bowls.</p>
<p>Just as I was having the sweetest dream, my mother woke me up and said, "It's dawn, it's broad daylight, Shou'er, hurry up and get up to herd the cattle!"</p>
<p>"Ugh." I frantically rubbed my eyes with both hands, my mouth protruding an inch long, feeling thirteen parts uninterested.</p>
<p>"Listen, the cow is calling in the pen, calling you little brother, and you still don't hurry up and get up!" My mother put clothes on me, but I still didn't want to move.</p>
