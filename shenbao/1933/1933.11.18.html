<h3>專結與負責</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>隔昨汪院長答人詢問迎胡入京事。謂國難發生以來。對於在野要人。均有一致聯合之必要。目前中國。决不能再一盤散沙。凡屬國人。均須一致團結。共負國家興亡之責。斯言誠屬切要。蓋我今日。外則强敵侵陵。内則匪患遍地。而國際間戰禍之將爆發。尤有被牽動之虞。故我國所曹國難。其嚴重十百倍於他國所高唱之國難。需要國内之團結一致。共負責任。亦十百倍於他國需要之迫切。然而竟如汪院長所言。成爲一盤散沙者何也。而所謂散沙。又不僅三數在野要人而已。恐在朝執政之各要人間。軍隊各將領間。亦不免有貌合祥離彼此隔膜之情勢。此又何故。以不能奮起負責之故也。因中央要人不負責。於是一遇難題。則互相推諉。互相粉飾。是非不敢爭。利害不敢辨。於此唯唯諾諾之中。苟有人心以爲非。或蓄疑而不釋者。則以無澈底明白决定之故。而心非者終於心非。蓄疑著終於蓄疑。此意見上之不一致。日久乃漸形於外。加以或因派別上之不同而起爭執。或因權位上之高下而生問題。積此種種隔閡。遂成一盤散沙之現象。散沙之現象旣成。一旦國難臨頭。非特不能一致起而共肩救國之重責。而無聊政客。投機專家。野心分子。亦得乘間以施其挑撥離間之手段。揑造似是而非之謡言。以加重國内之糾紛。而絕不慮益陷國家於危亡之絕境。此誠可爲之慨歎者也。</p>
<p>是故今日而言團結一致。非僅指天誓日以明無他之所能收效也。亦非僅故示寛大以廣招徠之所能辦到也。必也中央各要人。先自負起其責任。事事以公開光明之態度。宣示羣衆。確立救國之方針。明定國家建設之大計。不以空言昭示而以事實昭示。對於異已異派或認爲政見不合之人。虛心考量。以求所以合作之道。而勿過事苛求。此爲今日所急當坐言起行者。</p>
<p>雖然。團結之義。固非僅指在位者與在野要人而言也。在位者與在野要人之團結。不過政府方面之團結。而政府與人民間之團結。尤不可一日緩。夫人民之對於政府。非如在位者與在野要人有是非權位之爭也。又非如在位者與在野要人各人有各人之心也。人民雖衆祗有一心。不過希望政府能保衛其國家與人民之安寗耳。政府能從人民之心。負起責任。以盡力於爲國爲民之事業則人民自然不待勸而爭先恐後以援助政府。政府不能負起責任以盡力於爲國爲民之事業。則雖强迫人民援助。而人民終瞻莫前。故於今日而與人民言團結。祗須順從人民之心。以服從民意爲方針。無論内政外交。苟從人民之所欲以前進而勿以空言搪塞者。則人民自然與政府團結一致。無論如何一盤散沙之人民。不難凝成爲鋼鐵鑄成之基柱。苟如是則雖有軍閥政客投機家失意人物之挑撥播弄。造謡生事。又將何從施其技也。</p>
<p>在此動匪禦侮最重要之關頭。萬不可内部再有意外之技節。政府當局今旣負起責任以當國家之大難。對於一時蒙受挑撥離間之人。自必以大局爲重。開誠布公以消釋其誤會。則凡一時蒙受人之挑撥離間者。更應顧念全局。</p>

<h3>中國近代敎育思想概觀（四）　舒新城講述　孫育才筆記</h3>
<p>（二）軍國民民族革命時期（民國元年丨民國八年）民國成立以後、社會思想大變、敎育思想、自然亦因之而變、這一時期、眞負着繼往開來的重大使命、新舊思想更處處是矛盾衝突、値得一講、現在我把牠分做四方面來講、</p>
<p>▲軍國民敎育思想與軍事敎育思想、民國以後、因鑒於世界潮流和國勢危近的兩重原因、於是軍國民敎育思想、由是起興、目的在使國民全體、統須受軍事訓練、遇到有事時、都能執干戈以衛社稷、自民國元年公佈的敎育宗旨案、規定有軍國民敎育一項之後、社會紛紛宣傳、學校相繼實施、盛極一時、迨至民國八年、給國際的和平思想所激盪就不再起了、民國十年以後、漸漸蛻化到軍事敎育思想、一直伏流不斷到現在、這種思想自提倡到現在、計已廿多年、實際上何以不能發生重大的影響呢、第一是因爲士風的偷惰、第二是因爲執政當局對於這種思想的敵視、</p>
<p>▲實利敎育思想與實用敎育思想　因着中國舊敎育的空疏虛浮、新敎育的不切實用、又因着國際資本帝國主義的壓迫、所以便應時産生這種實利或實用主義的敎育思想、到民國六年並由實用主義敎育、遞嬗爲職業敎育、實利實用的思想、從此乃中斷、其最影響大的第一、敎科書漸和兒童能力社會需要接近、第二理科敎授逐漸注重實騐、第三植立了職業敎育科學敎育的基礎、只可惜當時提倡的一班人、是專門把小學做對象、而不注意中等敎育、所幸後來漸漸的擴大、現在中國的職業敎育、已由小學普遍到大學了、</p>
<p>▲美感敎育思想　民國元年、蔡元培首倡美感敎育、蔡氏自到德國置哲學、心理、美學之後、他就深感於德國的美育設施優長、且又因其根本思想、傾向於世界主義、所以極力起而提但美感敎育、認爲只有美」、才能破人我之見、進世界於大同、中國十多年來的美感敎育思想、實以他爲唯一的中堅人物、當時又因着美育本身底功能、政治底助力、時代思想的激盪、所以竟能在敎育實際上、綿延地發生些較大的影響、</p>
<p>▲大同敎育思想　現在的世界、固未嘗大同、將來是否得以大同、也還尙無確切的論證、然而希望大同的心理、却是人所同具的、這爲什麽呢、第一個原因自然是生發於希望解除苦的公共心理、第二是國際壓迫的反映、第三是中國人和平根性的表現、在近代中國敎育史上、首倡大同敎育的、是康有爲、他個人的敎育理想在（甲）種族改良（乙）育嬰及幼稚敎育、（丙）敎育平等、繼起鼓吹發揚的、如高一涵常乃惠等輩、可是這種大同主義的思想、他發源固由於人心之同然、他實際倒是不易實現的理想、所以我們如果要在實際敎育上、尋求這種思想的影響、却是比較别種思想爲難、康有爲底共産的大同敎育、高一涵底泛生大同敎育、和常乃惪底藝術的大同敎育、更純屬是一種超人的理想、在現實的世界中、自然不會有實現的一天、所以眞正的大同敎育、思想、在近代的中國中、可謂完全不曾發生過什麽影響、但這種思想的潮流、却因民治主義的反映、而使中國敎育界發生一些浪漫的自由的行動、終以適不住環境的壓迫、而延時不久、就衰落下去、</p>

<h3>翻版</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>讀烟橋先生在本欄裏發表的「翻版書」之後，竟給我抓住了一個好題目。世界上儘有比翻版外國課本，更富於幽默性的事。</p>
<p>德國，在歐戰之後，誰不指指點點地拿之爲「黷武國」，仩在决有戰敗之前，威風凛凛，誰不對於日耳曼民族的「鐵」與「血」，佩服到五體投地。就這一篇「黷武主義」，便不知有若干國家「翻版」過。在各國的「翻版本」之間，當推我同文同種的東鄰帝國，翻版得最是道地。不過「翻版」也並非怎麽容易的，所以我們的東鄰帝國努力。至現在，還只翻版到了「德國原版」的上半部。據說，現在正在準備把一九一四年及其以後的原版翻一下子。</p>
<p>布爾色維克，自然是俄國的原版名著，這一個版本，差不多世界上的任何一國，都試行翻版過了，但是珂羅版，影寫版，橡皮版，形形式式，都没有成功。所以現在除了「俄國原版」全部保存外，各國所有的，都不過是一鱗半爪，斷碢殘碑，去洛陽紙貴的程度還遠咧。</p>
<p>意大利也有一部名著，是法西斯蒂。據原著者說，法西斯蒂是不許翻版的，但德國却已有了很好的「翻版本」了。據說，翻版「法西斯蒂」，比了翻版，布爾色維克容易成功，而且法西斯蒂翻版本，也比了布爾色維克翻版本銷路暢旺，於是凡是翻版布爾色維克失敗的，都着手翻版法西斯蒂了。最好的例子，如土耳其，德意志</p>
<h3>投進了我的故鄉</h3>
<p>— 伯尼</p>
<p>事實上，我不能不回到我的故鄉去一趟。</p>
<p>星斗還在天頂與月亮挣扎，我已經慄慄地坐着街車，滾向北站去了！由法租界走公共租界，還是伸手不見五指；除了終夜筆立在街心的巡捕之外，狗都找不到一條，眞奇怪啊！我眞納罕呢，當我走近華界離站不遠的時光，不，將走到帝國主義權威所不能及的地方，終於天上放射出白色的曙光；我感謝啊；從黑暗的勢力下，送入了光明的自已的大地，我眞感謝呢，這勞苦的車夫！他竟具有了這様大的力量，我愈覺得自己的渺小了。</p>
<p>在火車停靠Ｓ州時，我跟着一大羣羣衆，從吐黑烟的怪物肚子裏擠了出來，重新又坐上了街車我這様坐着，舒適地坐着，頭仰着天，這里的景象，依舊是這般的靜靜地躺着：「蒼老的古城啊！久違了！一向是好？咦！你有望甚麽煩惱？你有些甚麽牢騷？嗄！我已經知曉：是不是因爲你是封建的遺老，而在你面前躺下的，是那座妖嬈的白色大橋，那資本主義向你攻擊的大砲，使你的命運生了不固的徵兆？他或許在你面前驕傲，因此使你火冒？………」Ｐ塔在我眼裏，已經不能再引起我的崇拜，在以前，似乎感到富有詩意，古典的風味，而現在更覺得有些厭惡。</p>
<p>資本主義走了Ｓ州的市塲，大減價的旗幟被風刮得豁刺豁刺地響，雷電霞裏的「小寳寳起來吃塊糕：」「話說申貴升…」「想起一叚　…」把整個Ｑ街鬧得翻了過來，因爲這様吵，還不夠他的慾望，於是一條Ｋ巷又被他拆寛了！我眞怕見這位吃普天下人的巨魔。</p>
<p>Ｓ州人善於吃，吃的店也特别多，從來也不曾肚子痛（有痛的是例外）吃啊！吃啊！但是從來也不曾有過人，想把壓迫我族的强隣吃下去，所以我開始奇怪了！我不願吃，我是窮光蛋，根本也吃不起，飯都没得吃呢！去吧，再走進我同時厭惡的小都市吧，我没有一處地方不厭惡，但我念厭惡，我愈想走進去，這是我的内在矛盾，這矛盾不斷地在生長看：我自己都有些納罕了！於今，我記起了一句話：</p>
<p>「我不入地獄，地獄裏的人更多更苦了！」嘿！嘿！好一句不要臉的牛話。</p>
<h3>秋風落葉</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>有人說：會計員忙碌終日，總盤旋在「一二三四五六七八九○」這十個字範圍以内，這話却很含有哲理。</p>

<h3>攝影場中的按摩院</h3>
<p>— 摩男</p>
<p>沈西苓導演在明星公司素有「怪物」之稱，最近他繼「女性的呐喊」導演「上海二十四小時」，已鬧過一次怪戲。那便是要導演一個老鼠偷食的鏡頭，老鼠不聽話，「夜物導演了一整夜，非惟没有拍到一尺片子，且連五頭老鼠都跑得一頭不剩。這件事，似乎各報都登載過了。</p>
<p>昨天，更怪了。她在「上海二十四小時」中，爲了暴露資産階級的淫慾生活，他安挿進了一塲，最近在上海風行一時的按摩院塲面。</p>
<p>是在明星公司的大棚中，搭了一所按摩院的門景及一間按摩室的佈景，據說，怪導演曾親自上霞飛路幾家按摩院實地觀察過，所以完全是寫實。</p>
<p>除了攝影塲上必要的職員和工友外，又有許多怪導演的親朋們，慕名而來參觀這聞所已聞見所未見的按摩院。</p>
<p>燈光打好了，開麥拉從「美美按摩院」化入按摩室。大胖子尤光照不惜犧牲色相，單看浴衣一襲，直躺在白色的彈簧床上。面上的表情帶有色情狂的色彩，尤其是那條玉腿，從浴衣裏露了出來，非常肉感。</p>
<p>於是，從按摩院中禮聘來的按摩女在攝影塲中出現了，打扮得像個女直護。只是面上終不免帶有幾分春色罷了。女直護是常常像個女修士般的。</p>
<p>於是，怪導演怪聲一呌，開麥拉乃軋軋作聲。按摩女拿起粉管，向尤光照的白胖的身上一陣撒。胖子早就不禁心醉了。接着按摩女輕舒玉腕，一推一揑，由你尤胖子是摩登柳下惠，也不免心動了。正在這一髮千鈞的當兒，怪物也知道不妙，急喊Cut，於是，這幕好戲乃無疾而終。尤胖子霍然而起，長嘆一聲罷了。</p>
<p>影塲觀者，閧然大笑。怪導演的怪戲於焉成功。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿　怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>他忽然想起來了，有一次由這裏經過，想着，將來每日有一趟由大營回海甸，現在，走的還是這一條道，假設的幻也，也就好像是昨日的事，可是自己走一條足，恐怕是最後一次了。想到了這裏就不由得抬起頭來，四面去觀看，青青的麥苗在葉叢中已經伸出了穗子來，迎着風，只管向人點頭，覺得它這様每次一點頭，都含着有惜别的意思。村子外的樹木，現在已經長的是綠油油的了，到了這些樹木的葉子都脫落乾凈了的時候。却不知道自己在那裏？海甸的屋脊，遠遠的望去，依然是那様參差着在平原上，往日看着，不覺得有什麽奇怪之處，今天這屋脊射到眼裏頭來，就覺得對於自己，有一種特别留戀之處。慢慢的走近了海甸心裏頭也就慢慢的跳了起來。那太陽光在大地上，是金晃晃的照着，這海甸街上早起的人，很快活的在那裏工作似乎在軍人眼裏看到帶血紅色的日光，在海甸市民眼裏成了黃金色了。趙自强心裏這就想着，一様的日光，在兩般人的眼光裏看來，就各有一種意味。這還罷了，昨天我回去說了，隊伍要由海甸經過，不知道我父親和楊家姑娘，是不是………他的感想，還不曾完畢，隊伍進了海甸街，遠遠的看到自己家門胡同口上，擁着一羣人，也不問這一羣人裏面是誰，他心裏早砰砰亂跳了。果然，這一羣人裏面，有他的父親，未婚妻，岳母，而且還有那個黃曼英女士。黃女士究竟是個女學生，不能很沉靜的忍耐，已經跑着迎上前幾十步。田青這一排人，恰是在趙自强前面，黃曼英看到田青站在隊伍旁邊，突然的站住了脚，兩手想向外一伸。（二四三）</p>

<h3>關於成音週率放大的注意點</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>收音機中最普通的成音週率放大是用變壓器放大的。放大較易，音量極富，可是失眞却不能免，我們在用此式放大時，變壓器的比數不要太大；眞空管，若用交流電源，就需用傍熱式的；丙電壓一定要很準確；末級輸出若能用强放管，則因栅極激勵電壓太大而引起的失眞即可免去；乙電壓不可太高；電源的濾波也需完美；頂要緊的便是不可用次等的變壓器。</p>
<p>如若變壓器的接綫有誤，很容易引起交流聲和其他奇怪的雜音。這時將初級或次級的接線互易往往可以免去。</p>
<p>最不失眞的放大方法要算電阻配合式了。因爲信號電壓是由電容器Ｃ經過的（圖一）屏極電流完全由Ｒ通過，不會像變壓器放大的因屏流飽和鐵心，或因構造不佳，不同週率的電流放大率起不平均而致失眞。屏流因從Ｒ流過，故應相當增加乙電壓以補Ｒ之降壓。通常電壓是不能比規定最大値小的，即使加到比原來的大三分之一，也是常見而無害於眞空管。</p>
<p>此式放大，可用至三級以上，若用五極輸出管則一級已足；Ｃ的數値，第一級可由ＯＩ以至１／２分兆分法拉，在末級的從ＯＯ４到ＯＩ成續均好；不可用得過大，太大了易生氣船聲。Ｒ普通不論何管均用　Ｉ大歐姆（即Ｏ，ＩＭeg）ＲＩ第一級可用二大歐姆以下的，末級可小到ＯＩ，大歐姆。</p>
<p>介乎上述二種之間約還有一種迴阻配合放大，音質，音量，都是很好的；對於交流聲，還可相當減少，所以業餘自製採此式甚多，綫路同圖一，不過在Ｒ的地方改裝一低週率扼制圈，或者可用已斷了綫的變壓器的完好的一綫圈來代。交流電是不能從扼制圈中通過的，所以Ｃ是成音週率電流唯一的通路。在此二式中，Ｃ的絕緣和耐壓是要注意的</p>
<p>要求音量大，當然五極管最好。不過要注意輸入的信號電壓，太小了，激勵不動；太大了，要失眞；而擴聲器的混合阻力也是要適合的。其餘乙，丙電壓如若不準，都不能顯出牠的效力來。</p>
<p>若要免除擴聲器濾流的裝置，那末輸出管的屏流不可超過十千分之安培，不然便有燒燬擴聲器線圈的危險，（當然不是電動式的）。輸出管五枉如－３８式，三極如Ｉ２Ａ式等很合用，願用國産喇叭諸君致意。</p>
<p>如利國産喇叭來放屏流較大的輸出，圖二是很好的濾流裝置，Ｃ的價値是Ｉ兆分法拉以上。</p>
<p>現在大概把普通的說了一些，末了，自造收音機的同志們若覺到交流聲太大，請改用後二種方式，同時需注意檢波段，他於交流聲有影響是極大的。電源如用三極管整流的Ｉ２Ａ式的交流聲比７Ｉ小得多，整流管須離檢波管遠些，或罩起來，雙屏整流那是珢滿意的。再用ＯＯＩ至ＯＩ的電容器接在整流管的屏絲二極間或電源變壓器高壓圈的兩端對於減少交流聲是很有效騐的。</p>
<h3>鎢錏管充電器的製法（續）</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>用十七號雙紗包綫繞在綫架上，每周互相密切，不要横亂交錯，以防消耗電力，繞滿一層後，用蠟紙或綢絹包裹其上（電綫不可剪斷）乃再繞第二層，依此類推，繞到五百五十周的時候，用一根軟電綫銲在中間，將此電綫引出，寫一記號，以便接線時不會弄錯（原十七號雙包線不必剪斷）直繞至一千一百周時，把電線剪斷，用線把繞綫上的綫圈紥緊，這綫圈輸入電流的，直接挿於電燈火綫上，呌做正圈，有電流輸出的，呌做副圈，正圈繞就後，乃繞副圈，副圈用十六號雙根並繞，每繞到五周時，出一線頭，就是一弗打，因爲變壓器的公式是：</p>
<p>正副電壓：副圈電壓＝正圈圈數：副圈圈數</p>
<p>２２０：Ｘ＝ＩＩＯＯ：５</p>
<p>∴Ｘ＝２２０×５／ＩＩＯＯ＝Ｉ弗（Volt）</p>
<p>繞到廿周時有四弗，卅周有六弗，乃將線剪去，線頭冠以Ｉ２３４５６等字，以便認識。</p>
<p>變壓器製就後，就要做電阻，電阻很容易自製的，將廿二號洋銀線（俗稱火爐線）繞在瓷管上面，每根瓷管可繞十五尺。三十尺則可繞在二根上·（繞時須注意·每周須有間隙不可互相接觸）在適當距離内，用軟花線紥緊在洋銀綫上，引出綫頭，亦冠以一二三四五六七八等字，如圖二。</p>
<p>各部製就後，乃連結起來，就成了一具鎢錏管充電器，連結法如圖三。Ｖ爲鎢錏管，Ｌ爲炭絲燈炮，Ｔ爲變壓器，Ｒ爲電阻器Ａ爲安培表Ｐ爲挿塞Ａ＋Ａ一爲充Ａ電的兩極。Ｂ＋Ｂ一爲充Ｂ電的兩極。</p>
<p>充電時先將線錏管燈絲電壓，旋至二弗，把電阻旋至最大値·若充Ａ電·將充電器上Ａ十接在蓄電池上陽極，Ａ－接在隂極上：若充Ｂ電，則接Ｂ＋與Ｂ－兩極，（注意：充電時隂陽二極不可弄錯，否則倒充電後，電池損壞）乃將挿塞挿入電燈線上，如果見鎢錏管燈絲微紅，則電壓尚不足，可將調節桿旋至三弗或四弗上；乃再將電阻調節桿旋動，至適當的電阻，俟電流表上有指示若干安培通過時才止，（注意：充Ａ電時電流不能超過二安培：充Ｂ電時，電流不能超過一○○千分安培，否則燈絲容易燒壤及壽命减短）</p>
<p>這充電器可充二弗至十二弗的Ａ電與五十弗及九十六弗的Ｂ電，倘若照上方法自製一具，自己或替人充電已很夠用了。（完）</p>
<h3>眞空管的過去與未來</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>最初時期的二極眞空管，僅用以代替礦石的工作就是檢波，到後來因爲僅僅檢波以後所得到的效力很微，於是有三極眞空管之發明而具檢波放大二重的作用。但其時檢波的眞空管亦可用作放大，並無多大的分别，且放大雖有高低調率之别，而其作用亦仍相同，僅裝置上略異而已。在ＤＣ時代的眞空管就是以如此而已。</p>
<p>因爲ＤＣ化的收音機經濟方面太消耗，於是漸漸改革，由ＤＣ而趨向於ＡＣ，現在的時期就是ＡＣ化的時期了，ＡＣ化時期内所應用的眞空管遠不如ＤＣ化時代的簡單，各種眞空管不但燈絲可用交流，且因無線電學術的進步。每一種眞空管各給以一種特有職司，因之眞空管，種類繁多，日新月異了。</p>
<p>從製造工程上說，眞空管亦天天在改進。以前的老式眞空管，大都作管狀與普通電燈泡相類似，燈絲最易振動，燈絲振動與眞空管壽命非常有關。而現在盛行的式様是上端較小，内有不導電體以固定燈絲栅極等之位置。</p>
<p>眞空管的形狀以愈小愈靈便，現在的眞空管，内部雖日見複雜，而形狀天天縮小，將來的眞空管有製如筆桿大小的希望，更有若干無線電家希望，能使一架收音機製成手錶様的體積，說來眞足驚人。</p>
<p>眞空管具有燈絲，壽命必受制限，聞最近已有無燈絲眞空管的製成，壽命當可較長。至將來其他奇特的發現，尚非今日所能逆料也。</p>
<h3>國定電阻器製造的經過</h3>
<p>— 克銘</p>
<p>固定電阻器是將量好的電阻原料很小心地裝進可製模型的陶土原料中，然後一同放在强烈的火上焙乾。</p>
<p>這種陶土原料磨成極細的粉，小心地加以他料混合着以得强力持久，和不受濕的各種性質，於是加以適當的水，合成爲可以流動的液體，經了長久拌和之後，再在特製的濾壓器中加以一百五十磅或更多的壓力使多乘的水分移去。結果所成的東西，是光滑柔順，可製模型的黏土，這種黏土的成分是岩石的細粉和他種黏土適當地配合使能焙成比任何單用岩石粉的能吃更强的熱。</p>
<p>製造電阻的原料是具有穩定電氣性質不易受强熱影響的礦物質十分小心地加以研磨並調成漿狀。</p>
<p>將上面這兩種漿或混合物放到一隻水力壓榨機中。這機的壓力筒造成像長管様子直徑八時裏面有較小的管子。外面的管子是裝入一隻磨子送來的陶土漿；磨子事前已把這物質重復調和並除去藏在裏面的微隙空氣。那電阻原料被壓入到較小的管子中，事前先經一隻極特製的機械使除去所有空氣而成眞空，因爲有空氣在内，將使原料起泡結果就將不一致。此後再加以很大的壓力，於是筒的頭雙層的的鑄型開了，兩種漿也像麫條様的吐出，那電阻原料完全包在陶土原料之中。</p>
<p>熟練的技工把這種軟條切成均一的長度，小心地放到淺盤中經傳遞帶送到一隻長的暖爐邊，慢慢的把水氣蒸乾，使這條狀的東西可以執在手中而不致變形，（未完）</p>
<h3>聆餘漫談（五）</h3>
<p>— 微言</p>
<p>丨國内播音界之現狀丨</p>
<p>此外播音節目優良的電臺固然還有許多，但是從事胡鬧的亦復不少。現在姑舉數例於左；</p>
<p>搭訕</p>
<p>一天晚上，已經一點多鐘了，忽然聽到一個老槍放着破竹般的聲音道：「××路王先生，儂阿曾聽見？聲音清爽𠲎？此地麻將三缺一，儂高興來𠲎」？接着又聽見他道：「××路趙先生，此地有交關好個菉荳湯，儂阿要來嚐嚐滋味」？這位先生在更深人靜，抽飽阿芙蓉之後，還會想到利用無線電來請客，眞是荒天下之大唐了！</p>
<p>駡人</p>
<p>某電臺所聘某敎授，因事多日缺席，該臺便當眞破口駡，他不顧信用，並向他提出嚴重的警告。利用無線電來駡人，眞是想入非非。此外因爲爭奪節目而引起的糾紛，彼此來電去波，互相訐駡，更是常見的事情</p>
<p>特别節目</p>
<p>有幾家小規模的電臺，没有錢去敦請外面的團體來奏唱節目。不得已，便化了幾毛小洋呼喚幾個街頭賣唱者之流，在臺上播送幾隻小調或是幾曲不上板的京戲，算是「特别」節目。這些事情，戳穿了眞要令人牙關笑掉！</p>
<p>摩登</p>
<p>最近各電臺播送的唱片，以摩登歌曲爲多，什麽「愛了瘦的嬌，節了肥的俏」，「我一看你，靈魂天上飄，愛情火様燒，全身熔化了」。這些辭句實在太覺「摩登」！就是風行一時的「催眠曲」，滿片「唔」「呀」的聲音，多聽了也足以銷磨國人的朝氣。</p>
<p>哭天哭地</p>
<p>除掉上述的摩登歌曲，就要輪到滑稽唱片了。本來寓莊於諧，亦自可取。但是上海流行的滑稽，實在太不成話。什麽「哭天哭的」「哭妙根篤爺」前幾天更天天可以聽到「哭王旡能」。還有「小和尚唸經」「老道士放燄口」……等等，都是他們絕好的資料。在我們看來，祇覺粗俗與可厭，並没有感覺到絲毫可笑樂的地方。</p>
<p>在中國商業化的播音臺，差不多要佔十分之八九。他們唯一的收入，全靠幾家商店委託他們代播節目。商店肯化錢播送節目，目的在推廣他們的營業，因此自不能不就聽衆的心理，來選擇羣衆所需要的節目。所以我以爲要改良播音的節目，第一便要提高國民的敎育程度。</p>

<h3>華棉運銷日本</h3>

<h3>在華日紗廠積極擴充</h3>
<p>上海爲日商紡織工業之大本營、近日方以我國抵貨運動、日　銷沉、日紗銷路又趨暢旺、同時鑒於印度越南各處抵制日紗政策之推進、更積極擴張對華侵略之野心、各廠均先後增添資本、謀擴張營業、日華紗廠原有資本爲一千一百萬元、最近已增加資本五百萬金、上海紡織公司亦增加三百萬元、日前同興華豐等五廠、並派考察團赴華北東三省各地、調查一切、擬在青島等地、另建設大規模棉紗紡織廠、上海紡織公司已决定增撥資本二百七十萬、建築大紗廠三所、以期增加産量、傾銷我國内部、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉市漲後轉平</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤復、各月份市面、呈初漲　　繼平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲六七角、坎拿大漲二三角左右、故開盤後、市氣雖見良好、本月份竟好至二角九角、遠期各月分、亦較好一分、惟二盤之後、以實銷帮未有動靜、浮多反有回出、致人心回平、交易亦已减少、迨至下午開盤、近遠期大致盤旋之態、交易亦未甚暢、其廠雖續成政府借麥一船、價四元二角、惟市場並未出檔、故市面遂仍平定也、結果十一十二月份反小二厘半、一月份小五厘、二月份小七釐半、三月大二厘半、四月份小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>買方興奮期麥漲　▲洋麥報好丨粉銷不强▲</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份均見穩俏之象、以洋麥報價芝加哥加好六七角、坎拿大好二三角、此種情形、似可爲買方增加興奮、惟從事實上言、因國内存底雖未枯寂、不過因落令檔口、到貨不能豐暢、并因粉銷之不寂、業中人遂一致看俏、此種供求、彷彿有利於多頭、故自開盤迄收盤、近期人心、甚覺堅定、據業中推測、恐須一見二角大關也、結果十一二月份各較漲五分、一月份漲四分、二三月份漲二分、現麥市面、因廠胃殷勤、存底有限、高貨喊價步昂較前日好五分不等、開　潼麥四元零七分、黃橋麥四元零七分、鎭江麥四元、江北麥四元零五分、由福新去二千包、祥新去四千六百包、</p>
<h3>晚稻到湧軟二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源驟湧、共到有八十餘號、貨約萬餘石、其中各帮晚稻占有近六十號、約八千餘石、以致晚稻市况未免垂軟、然其包胃去路亦復不少、計南北洋兩帮共去五千餘包、數計六七千石、是以後市形勢軟中似含轉定之象、至若本街店胃、大勢與昨相仿、惟因來源見湧、人心難免影響、致市况亦隨之下貶耳、統計全市晚稻行情修削二角有奇、常帮蘇同南港等價貶落角許、杜洋尖乏貨站定、隂變元無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）各路到貨四十七八號、市上銷胃仍不起色、市形新粳薄稻羊社埠秈價小數分、早稻白元客秈平定之格、</p>
<h3>糖市新潮青不久登場　▲成本較昂…來數有限</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以頻跌迄今、實銷依然沉寂、故趨勢續疲、公會划盤二四粗砂、白普通貨呌價又小一角、爲二十元二角、八九號荷赤高貨呌十六元、故古糖Ｂ嘜呌二十元五角半、小五分、均乏成交、中華一號綿白以十九元原價稍有開出、餘照退、振記本廠冰仁字開二十三元二角、乾字二十三元、潮帮開冲提莊十五元六角、黃崗青十五元四角、據地頭電訊、新潮青首批貨已有數十包裝出、三數日後可抵申、惟成本在十六元許、而身份色澤、恐不及陳貨、故號存陳貨、不致被其影響云、</p>

<h3>油市煤油漲價說不確</h3>
<p>上月間本報探悉在滬美孚·亞細亞·德士吉及油遍地各大煤油公司、因彼此競爭激烈·故油市恐有下跌趨勢、乃邇來本埠盛傳各牌煤油反有轉漲之可能、據傳美孚各牌煤油於十一月十五日後、每箱將漲價一元、其餘各公司每箱將漲半元、業經向可靠方面探悉、此種謡言乃爲投機份子所揑造、俾將本年三月間所購入之多頭貨、能於此經濟緊迫時期、提高價目、漸次出清、按煤油售價在最近之將來、不至高漲、目下美孚老牌新廳每對仍售五元四角、鷹牌新廳每對五元二角、其他各公司之新廳油批發價目不一、大約每對自五元四角至五元七角云、</p>
<h3>五金　五金已有收束氣象丨海外定價反見報漲丨</h3>

<h3>眞和假</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>Ｌ先生在「怎麽寫」一文中說：「記得年幼時，很喜歡看變戲法，猢狲騎羊，石子變白鴿，最末是將一個孩子刺死，……誰都知道，孩子並没有死……但還是出神地看看，明明意識着這是妙法，而全心沈浸在這戲法中。高一變戲法的定要做得眞實買了小棺材，裝進孩子去，哭着抬走，倒反索然無味了。這時候，連戲法的眞實性性消失了。」</p>
<p>所以，他的結論是：「一般的幻滅的悲哀，我以爲不在假，而在以假爲眞。」</p>
<p>我現在要加以補充道：「一般的滿足的歡喜，不在全眞或全假，而在似眞實假。」</p>
<p>何以見得呢？</p>
<p>記得在鄉下看戲時，最愛看用眞刀眞鎗打仗，臺上的打仗原是假的，用了眞刀眞鎗，依然是假的，但看客們可滿足得多了。還有，扮演落難公子的小生，手上倘若戴着金戒指時，台下就要唾駡，不過只要用一條白紙在戒指外面一包，問題就没有，看客們承認他是一個値得同情的人了。</p>
<p>眞正血肉飛濺的戰爭使人恐怖，眞正蓬首垢面的乞兒使人厭僧，而對於全假的事物，又不免感到空虛。心情脆弱而又不能完全空觀的人，於是只能從假的事物上求摹擬之眞以爲滿足。羅曼諦克的藝術作品卽由此産生而爲人所愛，故託爾斯泰名之曰「美麗的說謊，」且曰：「眞理是可怕的……人們照他所要知道眞理，說明眞理的願望是程度，努力地去懂得眞理，說明眞理……然而這决不是在藝術的形式之下去做，」</p>
<p>今日的世界的現實，極其可怕，使得人類的眼，不敢正視，只得轉去看戲，及和戲一類的事物了，所以，美麗的說謊更不盛行。</p>
<p>而且，對付眞，便得用眞，對付假，則可以用假，例如有一齣戲中，一個扮流落異鄉的義僕的戲子，跪在台上唱着求乞，於是看客們紛紛投以銅元，表示他疏財仗義，銅元愈多，那戲子唱的工夫愈延得長。這和近來的抗日英雄操賤業，仁人義士表同情，實在很相像。</p>
<p>把大握銅元擲給戲子的仁人，在長路上遇到，個眞的乞丐，未必肯施捨分文。對末路英雄大表同情的義士，當捐募義勇軍的接濟費時，未必慷慨地解過囊。</p>
<p>蓋以假對假易，以眞對眞難也。</p>
<h3>瀨治氏的山羊</h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>這是一篇佐藤春夫的小說，佐藤氏的作品，我最愛讀的，除了阿絹及其兄弟外，就是這一篇。</p>
<p>論到這一篇的思想與技巧，都不能算是他的代表作。阿絹及其兄弟，無論在那方面都比這篇强。但我賞識了這篇完全在另一種心情。大概是我已中年了的緣故罷？</p>
<p>這故事是叙述一個三十八歳年紀與妻子離異了的男子，他過着獨身生活，但他並不寂寞，他的周圍常有一羣青年跟隨着。他愛在他們中厮混，幾乎忘了自己的年齡。「人在四十歳以前是青年，此後十五年是壯年，」主人公有這樣的樂天。所以，他就在妝飾上，也不想現出自己之衰老。衣服穿得比青年還漂亮，合式。他說：「照外國的習慣，愈是上了年紀的人，愈穿漂亮的衣服。」但，最後總得有這様的一天，「你瞧！哦！那人的様子多麽討厭呵！」一位少女已不歡喜他面上的Philosopher's　line了。接着周圍的青年也走了，他於是轉而「去學習一種至今未曾學過的外國文，他最後把法文選做了他的愛人。」雖然，這位主人，在這以後還閙了一次無心的戀愛，可是，他老了，在費了三年的歳月後，「他所學到的便是語學，不能愛人的眞理。」</p>
<p>這是何等美麗的一篇含蓄深遠的故事啊！這確是日本風味的作品，在中國是難被人理解的。一個上了四十的人，在中國已是老年了。雖然他一様可以納妾，嫖娼，閙變愛的事可是少有的。這却不僅是他面上的Philosopher'sline，不爲女子所歡喜，而是自己的生命力的衰老與「外人的注目」而爲文明的禮制所不許，於是，我們的社會中有的是三十歳的老人，他的面貌，也顯出尊嚴，行動自然也要與青年有别了。「人在四十以前還是青年」在中國可要打一折扣。所以中國是古國，已近黃昏的古國。</p>
<p>「你瞧！哦！那青年的老頭子的様子多麽討厭啊！」我願聽中國青年也發出這様唾棄之聲來。</p>
<h3>深秋</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>秋深了。</p>
<p>黃葉從樹上掉下。西風撲面吹來，冷颼颼的，襲擊着每個人的心。</p>
<p>每年，一到這様的深秋時節，我的心就要意外地感覺岑寂。自從去年亡故了僅有的愛女，這岑寂上面，更加上深刻的創傷：只要一接觸着西風，我的傷痕就會復發起來，劇烈地痛楚着。</p>
<p>我怕過秋天！我尤其怕過這様的深秋！</p>
<p>在我的心開始感覺痛楚的時候，我所引爲唯一的慰藉的是妻。只有把我的心放在她温暖的懷裏，纔足以使我忘懷了一切。</p>
<p>雖然妻也和我一様，有着她悲痛的情緒。也許她心頭的創傷，比我還要深刻，因爲我常常瞧見她背着我在暗中低頭落滬。</p>
<p>但除了她，我是更無從尋覓我的安慰的了。</p>
<p>我們是在互相慰藉中生活着。</p>
<p>前幾天，妻對我說：她要回到母家去住一些時。我初聽見了，全身就覺得一凛，整個心像落入了冰窖裏面，半晌開不出口來。</p>
<p>「她去了　我更往何處寄託我這顆心呢」？我痛苦地這様想。但我又無法勸阻她，因爲她的性格是很執拗的。我只希望她能自動打消了這意念。</p>
<p>然而，事實終於無法避免。今天午後，我從辦事處回家來，便不見了妻。</p>
<p>屋子是更顯得平曠了，四周的牆壁彷彿都在壓迫着我。</p>
<p>我茫然的在椅上坐下，提起筆來，想寫作一些什麽，排遣我心頭的岑寂。可是，腦神經有些異様，構思了多時，還一個字都没有落上紙面，眼前却儘憧憧往來着亡故了的愛女的影子。我的心又有些痛楚起來了。</p>
<p>環境是怎様的空虛！窗外的氣壓也特别低降，緊壓着我的心，使我一刻都在椅上存身不住。我終於奮然的站了起來，鎖上了房門。</p>
<p>無聊地在街路上溜躂着。街路上是熱鬧的：車像長蛇般開動，人像蟻羣般擁擠着走，店舖裏的無線電在宏亮地播着音，栗子攤頭的留聲機在提高了噪子唱戲，報販口裏報告着當天的時局消息，乞丐釘在後面唸着丐經。一切都在作着有生命的律動。</p>
<p>但我的心却更覺得岑寂了！</p>
<p>猛可裏，從對面走過來一雙青年男女。兩個人的身子並得密必的，面上都浮着青春的歡樂。那女的流動的美目和誘人的微笑，都使我想到妻。她走近我身旁來時，投給我冷冷的一瞥，似乎在笑我的孤獨。</p>
<p>我不由得　忽忽的站住了脚步。</p>
<p>西風冷　　的吹撲到我身上，我的心痛楚的又　跳。我决定了去瞧妻。</p>
<h3>文學中的刺激性</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>有一位先生要寫「漫話」，第一個便把我來開刀。他說：「周作人先生的所以會引起唐先生的不滿，也許是爲了周先生不肯說誑」。亭句話的目的是在誣陷我也需要說誑。但他還故意把刀尖彎了一下，說我的不滿是爲了周作人先生：則是居心挑撥。</p>
<p>「其實」關於我個人的，也眞可以不必「大驚小怪」，而問題就在於不祗我個人。這回是把刺激當做說誑而痛詆之了，於是我又得「大驚小怪」。</p>
<p>刺激二字出現在漫話家筆下的時候，如果不作另解，那末我說，一切的文學都有刺激性的。即使是描寫最平凡人的最平凡生活，只要細心去讀，便會找出他的特點，發覺和自己生活有不同的地方，而有所感觸的。這種感觸從那裏來的呢？曰：來自「刺激」</p>
<p>使人看了，後而一無感觸，看了等於不看，亭還能算是文學麽？</p>
<p>即就周作人先生而論，（不作我對他滿或不滿解。）他的筆底也是富於刺激性的。他慣從細小的事情裏寫出社會的矛盾，他慣從日用的東西裏寫出今昔盛衰之感，他常把這些來刺激讀者，如果刺激即是說誑，那末周行狂不是也說誑了麽？</p>
<p>然而據說他又是並不說誑的。</p>
<p>文字之有刺激性，不自今日始，也不自中國始。人們把生活思想搬到文字上來的時候，刺激也就隨著存在了。如果要否認刺激，除非把文學完全推翻。</p>
<p>至於寫些雪白的大腿，顫動的乳峯，騙幾個錢來造洋　，是則不善用其刺激，斯流於麻醉，流於說誑欺騙，爲害青年。而刺激不與也。</p>
<p>世乃有爲人圓「誑」，而提倡没有刺激的文學者，我怎得不「奇怪」。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十二）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>聽着這話，大家誠敬地靜默了下，正像做過禱告以後一様：博齊汝是最會恭維人的，他說道：</p>
<p>「祗有女人才能有這様的幽思妙想。」</p>
<p>隨後他轉身向羅蘭老爹：</p>
<p>「這瑪賴沙究竟是一個什麽人？你眞個和他交情極深嗎？」</p>
<p>老頭兒因爲喝醉了酒感動起來，竟出聲哭了，他吃吃地說道：</p>
<p>「簡直像自己的兄弟……你懂得啦……如今這世間找不出的朋友……我們時刻不離……他每天晚上在我們家裏晚餐……他有時邀我們去看戲……我祗能告訴你這……這……這……」個朋友，一個眞朋友……一個眞朋友……不是嗎，路易慈？」</p>
<p>他的女人很爽利地回道：</p>
<p>「是啦，這是一個忠實的朋友。」</p>
<p>筆爾瞧着他的父親和母親，但好像别人在說旁的事一様，他又喝起酒來。</p>
<p>這晚的盛會究竟是怎様散塲的，他一點都記不起來了。大家喝了咖啡，欲了甜酒，開了很多的玩笑。隨後到半夜時分，他神志模糊，頭腦昏沈地去睡了。他像畜牲一様一直睡到第二天早上九點鐘才醒。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>這浴着香檳酒和沙特勒兹酒的睡眠，無疑的使得他緩和且寗靜下來了，因爲他醒來時，神志非常良好。他一面穿衣，一面批判，研究，並歸納他昨晚的情緒，盡力明確且完備地求出發生這情緒的眞實的秘密的原因，個人的原因和外面的原因。</p>
<p>那啤酒店的女孩子聽說羅蘭兩個兒子裏面的一個單獨地繼承了一個陌生人的遺産時，也許眞曾有着一個醜惡的想頭，一個賣淫女的想頭；可是這班娼女對於一切貞淑的婦人不是常常無緣無故地有着同様的疑心嗎？她們談話時，我們不是聽到她們咀咒，中傷，詆毁一切毫無缺德的女人嗎？每逢人家在她們的面前講到一個無可非難的婦人時，她們便生氣起來，好像人家侮辱了她們一様，呌說道：「啊！你知道啦，我認識你所講的這此給過婚的女人，她們眞」</p>
<p>乾凈！你們比我們有着更多的情人，不過她們都是些作僞的人，會把她們的情人隱藏起來罷了。啊！是啦，她們眞乾凈！」</p>
<p>在别的時候，他一定不會懂得，甚至想像都不會想像到别人會對於他那可憐的，那様善良，樸質，正大光明的母親發出這様下流的暗示，但他的心靈當時被那在他身上發酵着的嫉妒的酵母所侵擾。他那受着强度刺激的精神，簡直不由自主地在窺伺着一切足以妨害他弟弟的事情，這種精神，甚或派給了這啤酒店的待女以她本來没有的可憎有意思也說不定。也許祗是他的幻想，他自己不能駕御的幻想，常常逃出他的意志，自由地，勇敢地，冒險地，隂毒地，溷入那無窮的思想的世界，而有時從那兒帶來一些不能告人的，可恥的思想，好像偷來的東西一様，藏在他身上，藏在他的靈魂深處，茂在那些不能探索的壁縫裏：也許祗是這種幻想惹起並發明了這可怕的疑問。他的心，他正己的心，當然對他有着一些秘密；而這受傷的心也許在這可怕的疑心裏得到了一個使他的弟弟失去這筆爲他所嫉妬的遺産的方法罷。他現在自己懷疑着自己，自己查問着自己思想的神秘，好像那些信心家問着自己的良心一様。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「現在」</h3>
<p>— 蓉</p>
<p>生存在這様一個迷亂矛盾的社會裏，大部份的人，共通的都是在十分地感着現實的没辦法和絕望，所以，他們之中，好些都因受不了這痛楚的折磨而失了奮鬥的勇氣，於是便消極悲觀了丨但是其中也有幾個比較稍微肯用腦思想的，他們都認爲這是一個最大的遺憾的不平：他們都一致地說，「難道這倒是我們大部分的人應富遭受的嗎？」然而，這只是最平常最普通不過的一個「不平」，或者簡直說是「呻吟」而已。因爲他們没曾想到怎様可以彌補這缺陷的「不平」，更不知正是需要鼓着最大的勇氣爲現實而抗戰丨丨至少也要自衛，然而僅僅自衛，已經夠没出息了！而且，他們在「不平」了多少時候以後，也許他們亦會照様消極悲觀起來了。不然便是退走了，逃避了，而成爲扔了「現在」而迷戀甜蜜的狂歡的過去，和期待虛渺的温暖的將來的兩批第三種遊離的東西了！</p>
<p>這第三種遊離的人，是如此的：他們覺得「現在」旣然是如此殘酷恐怖不能親，所以他們就打算避免「現在」，或是隨順「現在」，冀圖把「現在」擱起，甚至扔了，而且自願亦是自暴地走上了一般所謂頽廢詩人，傷感文學家之類的隊伍裏去了，於是他們日常的生活便是拚命追懷和讚美過去的甜蜜，愉快，狂歡等等，把自己的心從根柢麻木起來，身體整個腐化下去；或是以期待和歌頌將來的美妙，温暖，幸福等等來自欺，使自己深深墜入浪漫虛幻的世界去做一個瘋子，狂人，自痴……。然而他們的懷念和期待能夠幾時足以給他們如願以償呢？過去的終於是完全過去了，抓得回來嗎？爪得轉去嗎？將來的呢，却在眼面前障碍着這一大段「現在」，怎様跨過這一大段呢？這一大段是跨得過，扔得趧的嗎？而且所謂「現在」，是不是要承認它是眞有其事的呢？如其有的，有没有一天終於會到的呢？等到「將來」到臨以後，不便亦成爲「現在」了嗎？在「現在的現在」所期待所幻夢着的，是不是就在「將來的現在」到臨之時便輕快如意地一古腦兒都帶來了呢？如其不然，他之在「現在的現在」所期待用幻夢的所謂「現在的將來」，那只有讓他成天的躱在牀舗上，躱進被窩裏去白天做夢罷了。所以，這種遊離的人，最夠可憐的，他們一方面親受着「現在」給他們的痛楚，一方面還要受到懷念和期待的幻滅的悲哀，而使變成傷感，頽廢，浪漫，麻木，腐朽，墮落的没有靈魂的睜開眼睛清醒着做夢的瘋子，狂人，白痴之類了！</p>
<p>這便是忽視「現在」輕視「現在」，没有把握「現在」的錯誤！然而又應當怎様把握「現在」呢？答話很簡單的：「現在」，雖然是殘酷，恐怖，不可親，它的本身却是光明的，潔凈的，温柔的，最可愛可親可可靠的，其所以成爲殘酷，恐怖，不可親，請讀者「仁者見仁智者見智」的各自解答罷，其反映出來的迷亂，矛盾，以致使大部份人所感受的没辦法和絕望的痛楚，也是必然的（暫時的）不足希奇的，問題只在人們旣然　它感覺痛楚而不滿，那末就要下决心設法把它弄得」滿」些：第一，不悲觀，不退走，不隨順「現在」，不扔棄「現在」，第二，放棄空虛的抓不回的過去和渺茫的不可期的將來，第三，創造「現在」，踏上這大段跨不過，扔不掉的荆棘的現在，爲現在而抗戰，而鬥爭！等到勝利以後，　　的　　，　　，甜蜜，愉快才是永恒地屬於　大部分的人們的。</p>

<h3>如此學生</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>自己盛意地熱烈地奔入了敎育界去服務，恐怕要事實將要使我敗興而返了吧！在我以前的理想中，當一個小學敎師，在精神上是必然得到最大的安慰的，那天眞的一羣活潑潑底小孩，多可愛哪！我想像中，孩子們的小小的頭腦是純潔靈敏而可創造的，他們又是必定樂於聽從的，小小的坦白的心田，是歡迎我們將一切有益的輸送上去而隨我們去灌溉的，他們的舉止是活潑玲瓏而令人深愛不倦的……可是，可是誰知呀！一年來的經歷，我是不能不深深地感到失望而有畏縮之心了。啊丨這様一羣令人怕接近的小東西呀丨</p>
<p>誰都是在這様說：「學生是未來中國的主人翁」，「健全中國的創造者」，「革命的後盾」，「國家的靈魂」……可是這様的學生是未來中國的主人翁嗎？健全中國的創造者嗎？國家的靈魂嗎？革命的後盾？醒醒吧！這様希望着的人們丨因爲你們過份相信了，會使你失望更深的，所受的瘡痕更大的。最初我們所信仰的是留學生，想把救國建國的主任負荷在他們身上，想他們來救來建，結果是使我們失望了，於是我們就將這様的希望移到大學生中學生身上，想賴他們來救來建，可是結果呢，同様的又感到失望了，於是我們不得不抱着無限的希望，希望孩子能給我們如願以償，但就現在情形，同様也會要使我們失望的。那末我們的希望將移到那個身上呢？向誰去期待呢？一切都失望了。這唯一僅有的小學生又予我們以悲感了！</p>
<p>中國所應取的敎育法不應該是放任或其他目的方法，唯有嚴厲還有一些兒挽回的餘地。小學生是太没有頭腦了。「媽虎」的敎師是他們最所歡迎不過的，可是我們的同事大家又不肯幹這有負天良的媽虎事，因此被小學生的暗駡當然是免不了的事。所以我們在課餘之後，互相接談眞的覺得有同病相憐之苦，我們對於這様的一輩，眞的覺得有些没術了。身任敎職，又不能辜負良心而不負賣，對這種的一輩學生，駡駡他祇當是耳邊風吹了過去，打他過一會兒就會痛過的，關夜學也算不得什麽一會事，好在到家去在父母面前說了一個謊就可了事的。學問不學問完全放在腦後也無閒去顧矣，問他們時回答了一個簡單的「不懂」就算了事。敎室中罰立，更不算什麽一會事，所以我們都說：「世界無難事，獨怕老面皮。如此的學生，怎様去敎導呢？於是漸漸的敎師們因爲厭惡這些小學生。而怕去接近學生了，這様就無異於羣羊失了牧人，失了牧人的迷羊，怎能免去墮入歧途呢？</p>
<h3>「中了奬了」</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>蘭跑進了辦公室的門口，同事們就這様的對她說：『蘭，你來得好遲呀：告訴你一個好消息呢，十月三十一日航空奬劵不是在逸園開彩了嗎？Ｗ君前天去買了一條，他買來的時候，我們大家都說他的號碼是怪特别的，很有中奬的希望，果然呀；現在看了報紙，他中了四彩，一星期後可向銀行裏領亮晶晶，圓渾渾的二百塊大洋鈿呀：他答應我們請三十元錢客呢？啊：一個中山頭，不勞身心，就可獲得了二百個，這様不勞而獲，多多寫意呀！誰不眼熱呢？像我們一天到晚坐在這酸溜溜地窮室裏，什麽都没有企圖，什麽都没有希望。聽說下期還有，還有第三期的呢，整張的買不起，無論如何我總要去買它一條，假使碰着了運氣，我是頃刻就成富翁了！呵，嘗富公的味道，多有趣哪！……」蘭因事跑到樓下去，用着羨慕的眼光向Ｗ君致詞說：「恭喜呀：中了奬了。」當蘭看見Ｗ君的時候。</p>
<p>時間是已到了十二點鐘了。包飯作的飯送來了；「Ｗ君中了奬了呀！我們來呌一桌三塊錢的和菜請他吧！」Ｃ君這様的提議着，大家都讚成了他的意思，於是派傭人先呌菜了。Ｃ君在飯廳裏徘徊着，嘴裏在支配着Ｗ君三十元錢的用途，什麽先到新雅裏吃中飯，後到大光明看影戲，再到青年會吃西菜……，不斷地籌劃着。菜是來是，他們大家熱閙地吃着。席終，Ｗ君給我們看了奬劵的號嗎。呀，我的老天，他中了什麽？連什麽末尾都没有碰着呀！他們受的這玩笑的欺騙，自己都覺得怪好笑的。</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in Fujian Province: Hu Hanmin Expresses Unawareness, Guizhou Representative Declares Non-Participation, Southwest Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude, Political Council Sends Chen Rong to Visit Hu, Central Government Remits 600,000 Yuan to Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) All sectors of industry, agriculture, commerce, and education in the province plan to hold a mass rally on the morning of the 19th. Zhang Xiang arrived in Fujian today, and Zeng Qian also arrived in the province from Quanzhou. There are reports of him taking over as the Director of Civil Affairs. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lu said on the 17th that the Southwest authorities do not know the truth about the Fujian political change, so they have no comment. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest Political Council sent Chen Rong to Hong Kong on the 18th to visit Hu Hanmin and discuss Fujian affairs. Hu told reporters on the 17th that he was not very clear about the Fujian matter and had never been to Fujian. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Fang Zhenwu secretly arrived in Hong Kong. (17th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yang Dezhao returned to Shanghai on the Russian Empress at 10:00 AM on the 17th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Government remitted 600,000 yuan in August, which was remitted to Guangdong by the Guohua Bank on the 16th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zhang Wenliang (transliteration), the representative of Guizhou Provincial Chairman Wang Jialie stationed in Guangzhou, issued a statement today stating that the rumors that Chen Mingshu would be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the five provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, Guizhou Province did not participate in this new movement, and Guangdong Province will also be excluded. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The situation in Fujian Province is still chaotic. All news about Fujian Province arriving here is subject to censorship. None of the Guangzhou newspapers have published a single word so far. The Chinese here now believe that the news of Fujian's independence reported in Shanghai is largely untrue. The Southwest Political Council is paying close attention to the news from Shanghai, but it is not aware of this new development and is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. It is rumored that Chen Jitang once telegraphed Li Zongren and Chen Mingshu to inquire whether the news of taking the post of commander-in-chief of the five provinces was true. Li replied in a telegram that he did not know about it. It is also rumored that Chen Jitang sent his confidants to Hong Kong to visit Hu Hanmin to find out the truth. An officer of the 19th Route Army stationed in Guangzhou stated today that they had not received any news of the developments in Fuzhou. A Reuters reporter inquired with the Guangzhou government whether there was any truth to the report that an independent government would be established in Fuzhou on November 20. According to the spokesman, it was completely untrue. Chen Jitang had issued an order prohibiting the recruitment of soldiers, so the recruitment offices set up here by the 19th Route Army have now been closed. The authorities claimed that this ban was issued to all armies, not specifically to the 19th Route Army. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, the Hong Kong Chinese newspapers published news about the Fujian situation, with very mild language, which was very different from the previous day. Public opinion believes that the crisis has been averted. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of the 19th Route Army stationed in Nanjing said that various news from Fujian can only be seen in newspapers here, but it is feared that it is mostly based on Tokyo dispatches. Director Huang Hechun also serves as the director of the General Headquarters' management office, and is in charge of receiving payments and materials for all the armies in Fujian, as well as all affairs. He is usually stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai. This time, he requested winter cotton clothing for the headquarters. The central government only temporarily issued more than 40,000 sets, because the entire Fujian army has about 80,000 people, so the number issued is less than half. He went to Shanghai to add cotton clothing, and prepared to send personnel in batches to Nanjing. Today, I also received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Cai, who urgently needed it for suppressing bandits. He ordered the transfer here to request military supplies for application from the Ministry of Military Affairs. It was reported that Chairman Jiang of Fujian invited Hu Hanmin to Fujian, with some attempts. No news has been received here. It is also rumored that this office is already in the process of closing down, and Director Huang has been ordered to return to Fujian to take up an important position. Many parties have made many phone calls to inquire these days, and all have been earnestly explained, and nothing has happened. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Central Committee talked to a certain reporter that the Central Committee had already determined its attitude towards the Fujian situation. It is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. If Chen Jiang and others really have a telegram, they should decide how to deal with it based on the extent of their claims. If it is only a dispute over political views, we will resolutely uphold the past spirit of leniency and tolerance, and regard it as an internal dispute of our party, and use political methods to carry out communication and jointly deal with the current crisis. If it is issued against the party, the central government has its own appropriate countermeasures. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs Commends the 45th Division</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Military Affairs commended the 45th Division, saying that the division was ordered to advance and suppress bandits in the Gushang border area. The officers and soldiers were brave and the command was effective, and they were finally able to clear the area within the time limit and properly handle local aftermath. This is specially commended by a clear order to show encouragement, and it is announced to all officers and soldiers of the entire division for their information, and to continue their efforts. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Administrative and Political Reorganization Committee Will Not Expand Its Scope</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the reorganization of the Administrative Yuan's resident Ping Political Reorganization Committee, a certain central committee member said that although the organization has changed this time, it will not expand the number of its members, which will still be 23. An additional chief advisor will be added, and a construction committee will be formed to hire experts to engage in design. After the National Government issues a clear order, it can be reorganized. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Appoints Xue Yue Commander of the 7th Column</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, because Xue Yue, the commander of the Fifth Army, killed more than 7,000 bandits in Ziyang Town, and the city of Lichuan was in danger and recovered, specially appointed Xue as the commander-in-chief of the Seventh Column. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits Forced to Retreat from Jianyang Jiangkou to Chong'an</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) On the 13th, more than 700 bandits arrived at Jiangkou in Jianyang. After a fierce attack by Zhang Luanji's brigade, they collapsed and returned to Chong'an on the 16th. Zhang telegraphed the province yesterday to report the victory. The military is resting. There are only 5,000 remaining bandits in Jian, Tai, Ning, Changting and other places on the Fujian border, with 1,000 to 2,000 guns. Luo Binghui and Lin Yi were seriously injured and have now fled to Jiangxi. Deng Shizeng went to Yanping on the 16th to preside over the military affairs of the General Headquarters's camp. The Dadaohui in various townships in Yanping were reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army by Tan's division and given training to become a popular armed force. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Song Plans to Go to Beiping to Negotiate Military Salaries with He</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin said that after the military salaries in North China were reduced, the monthly amount still reached 5 million. In addition to the 3 million yuan from the central government, the income in North China was only 700,000 to 800,000, and there was still a shortage of more than 1 million yuan per month. Therefore, on the occasion of his previous trip to Tianjin, he discussed with Yu Song and asked him to find a way to continue to allocate 500,000 yuan for Hebei Province and 300,000 yuan for Chahar Province. However, after the war disasters in Hebei and Chahar, the finances were in dire straits. Although Yu Song tried his best to raise funds, the detailed methods are still under negotiation. Yu Song is scheduled to come to Beiping tonight or tomorrow to visit He for consultation. At the same time, Yu Song is a member of the Political Reorganization Committee that has changed its organization, and will also discuss everything with Huang. After everything is over, Yu will return to Tianjin immediately, and Song will stay a little longer to return to Chahar. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Definite Progress in Negotiations on Inner Mongolian Autonomy Issue Central Principles Expected to Be Accepted Details Still Need to Be Discussed at Length Bai Yunti Will Go to Replace Huang to Deploy Everything Prince De, Prince Yun and Others Hope that Zhangjia Will Depart Soon</h3>
<h3>Rumor that Prince De Has Abandoned the Original Proposal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the situation in Inner Mongolia, due to the large difference between the Mongolian people's plans and the opinions of the Suiyuan authorities on the issue of the scope of the Inner Mongolian autonomous region, Huang and others convened a meeting of representatives of various leagues, banners, kings and princes in Bailingmiao, which was discussed in detail. The princes and representatives have expressed their acceptance of the central government's principles, and in the future, all places in Sui and Cha that have not yet been designated as counties will be discussed within the scope of autonomy, which does not conflict with the powers of the provincial government. Because the provincial government has never interfered with all administrative, cultural, and educational matters in Mongolian areas that have not been designated as counties, in the future, they will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous center in order to achieve the goal of self-determination. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Huang Zhao met with Prince De and Prince Yun and others, the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy has indeed developed. However, the details are still under discussion, so Huang Zhao may leave the temple and return to Sui recently. It seems too early to say whether the Mongolian affair is resolved. When Huang Zhao leaves Sui and returns to Beijing on a scheduled date, Bai Yunti will go to Sui to replace Huang to deploy everything. The central government believes that before the Inner Mongolian issue is thoroughly resolved, the resident officials in Sui will not be withdrawn for the time being. Huang Zhao will return to Beijing to report on the negotiation process and submit the draft agreed upon by both parties to the central government for review. The scope and organization of Inner Mongolian autonomy are subject to the final decision of the central government. Bai Yunti also had contact with various princes and princes and related parties in Ping. The estrangement between the Mongolian Association and Zhangjia has been resolved after Bai's days of running around. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bailingmiao telegram, the plan to resolve the Mongolian affair will be based on the results of the consultations on the 15th, and representatives will be sent by both parties to study and reconcile the methods, and the deadline is the 17th. Then Huang Zhao will invite various princes and princes to formally discuss in order to determine the principles. Huang Zhao is scheduled to return to Sui around the 20th, and personnel from the Ximeng and Wumeng will set off on the 18th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

Gong telegraphed Ping to report that he has left the temple and went to Guihua and will return to Ping within a few days. The central government has not yet remitted Zhangjia's travel expenses to Mongolia to Ping, and the date of departure has not yet been determined. This time, many said that Zhang was obstructing Inner Mongolian autonomy. When Li Gong and others met Prince De in Bailingmiao, the misunderstanding has been explained. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Jianzhang, secretary of the Mongolian Banner Propaganda Envoy's Office, visited Bai Yunti yesterday afternoon. Bai visited Zhangjia yesterday afternoon.

<p>(Beiping) Prince Yun and Prince De of Inner Mongolia telegraphed Ping, welcoming Zhangjia to Mongolia. Zhangjia telegraphed Prince Yun and Prince De on the 15th, saying that he would depart after Li Shoushan and Gong Ziwan returned to Ping. Prince De of Inner Mongolia recently sent Miler Qide with a handwritten letter from Prince De to Ping to visit Zhangjia and inquire about the date of Zhangjia's trip to Mongolia, saying that the Mongolian princes and princes were hoping that Zhang would set off soon to discuss the issue of autonomy. Zhang replied that due to time constraints, he may not be able to attend the Bailingmiao meeting as scheduled, but he was ordered by the central government to enter Mongolia to preach, so he should go, but the date of travel has not yet been determined. Qide also met with Bai Yunti to report on the situation in Inner Mongolia and the Bailingmiao meeting. Qi returned to Bailingmiao this afternoon to report his mission. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bailingmiao telegram on the 17th, Prince De has abandoned the original proposal for the Inner Mongolian autonomous organization. Huang Zhao and Prince De and others discussed the new proposal separately in the afternoon of the 17th. After the principle is agreed upon, Huang Zhao will leave Bailing and return to Sui to seek opinions from the two provinces of Chahar and Sui, and then return to Beijing to decide on the handling plan. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain organization in Beijing obtained a telegram from Bailingmiao on the 15th, which reported the details of Huang Zhao's arrival at the temple in great detail. The original telegram said, "After we arrived at Bailing, we helped the chiefs and representatives of the various leagues and banners to organize a reception center for central government officials, arranged houses, and hired ten cooks from Suiyuan to prepare food and drink. We also organized a police guard for central government officials, which was jointly guarded by the guard teams of the Yun and De Leagues and the Panchen Lama. The two senior officials, Huang and Zhao, arrived at the temple on the 10th with Xu Tingyao, the army commander, and more than a hundred accompanying officers and soldiers. The representatives of the chiefs and others set up curtains on the left side of the road to solemnly greet them. The military, civilians, monks, and laity who participated were arranged for several miles, which was an unprecedented event here. That night, the Yun and De leagues held a banquet to welcome the officials. On the 11th, they prepared whole sheep, milk wine, congratulatory speeches, and Mongolian songs, the most respectful etiquette in Inner Mongolia, to express their welcome. The officials also saluted in return. On the 12th, 32 Mongolians were selected to hold wrestling, and 500 lamas from the temple chanted scriptures to pray for the country. On the 13th, Mongolian officials, soldiers, women, and children held horse races separately. From this day on, the chiefs and representatives plan to accompany the senior officials on a hunt. The enthusiasm of the Mongolians' welcome is evident. The autonomy issue has been discussed several times. We have been shuttling back and forth, striving for perfection. The officials and the representatives of the chiefs can especially open up and meet each other. In the past few days, considerable results can be obtained. The officials need to stay here to continue to discuss the autonomy issue, so they decided to send Liu Puchen and Shen Zhongkuan to various banners of Ximeng, and Kong Qingcha and E Qiguang to various banners of Wumeng to patrol on their behalf. The weather has been particularly warm and clear recently, and many Mongolians say that it is a harbinger of a bright future." (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Exclusive Alliance and Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Wang answered inquiries about welcoming Hu to Beijing. He said that since the national crisis occurred, it has been necessary to unite all important figures in opposition. Today's China can no longer be a pile of loose sand. All Chinese people must unite and share the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. This statement is indeed important. Because today, we are facing foreign enemies invading, bandits all over the place, and the impending outbreak of war in the international arena may be dragged into it. Therefore, the national crisis faced by our country is ten to a hundred times more serious than the national crisis touted by other countries. The need for domestic unity and shared responsibility is also ten to a hundred times more urgent than the needs of other countries. However, what is the reason why it is like a pile of loose sand, as President Wang said? And the so-called loose sand is not just a few figures in opposition. I am afraid that among the important figures in power in the court, and among the generals of the army, there is also an inevitable situation of seeming agreement but internal disunity and alienation. Why is this again? It is because of the inability to rise up and take responsibility. Because the important figures in the central government do not take responsibility, they shirk responsibility from each other and whitewash each other when they encounter difficult problems. They dare not argue about right and wrong, and they dare not distinguish between interests and harms. In this situation of yes-saying, if someone has doubts or suspicions that are not released, it is because there is no thorough and clear decision. The doubters remain doubters, and the suspicious remain suspicious. This inconsistency of opinion gradually manifests itself over time. In addition, disputes arise due to differences in factions, or problems arise due to the levels of power and status. Accumulation of these various estrangements forms a phenomenon of a pile of loose sand. Once the phenomenon of loose sand is formed, once a national crisis comes, not only will we be unable to rise up and shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country in a unified manner, but unscrupulous politicians, opportunistic experts, and ambitious elements will also be able to take advantage of the opportunity to carry out their means of instigating discord and fabricating seemingly correct rumors to aggravate domestic disputes, and never consider further plunging the country into a desperate situation of peril and destruction. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, talking about unity is not just about making vows to prove that there are no other effects. It is also not just about showing leniency to attract people. It is necessary for all important figures in the central government to first take on their responsibilities, declare to the masses with an open and bright attitude in everything, establish a national saving policy, and clearly define the grand plan for national construction. Do not show it with empty words, but show it with facts. For those who have different opinions or are considered to have different political views, consider them with an open mind to seek ways to cooperate, and do not be overly demanding. This is what we should urgently put into practice today.</p>
<p>However, the meaning of unity is not only referring to the figures in power and the figures in opposition. The unity between the figures in power and the figures in opposition is only the unity of the government, and the unity between the government and the people cannot be delayed for a day. The people's attitude towards the government is not like the figures in power and the figures in opposition who have disputes over right and wrong. It is also not like the figures in power and the figures in opposition who have their own hearts. Although the people are many, they have only one heart, only hoping that the government can protect their country and the peace of the people. If the government can follow the hearts of the people and take responsibility to do its best for the cause of serving the country and the people, then the people will naturally scramble to help the government without being persuaded. If the government cannot take responsibility to do its best for the cause of serving the country and the people, then even if it forces the people to help, the people will still not dare to move forward. Therefore, today, when talking about unity with the people, we only need to follow the hearts of the people and take obedience to public opinion as the guiding principle. Whether it is domestic or foreign affairs, if we move forward from what the people want and do not perfunctorily deal with them with empty words, then the people will naturally unite with the government. No matter how much the people are like a pile of loose sand, it is not difficult to condense them into a steel-cast pillar. If so, then even if there are warlords, politicians, speculators, and frustrated people who instigate and sow discord, and create rumors, where will they be able to use their skills?</p>
<p>At this most important juncture of suppressing bandits and resisting insults, there must be no more unexpected techniques internally. The government authorities have now taken on the responsibility of facing the national crisis. For those who have been temporarily subjected to instigation and discord, they will naturally take the overall situation as the most important thing and eliminate their misunderstandings with openness and honesty. Those who have been temporarily subjected to instigation and discord should also consider the overall situation.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should the arrival of this national crisis be regarded as an opportunity to seize power, and it should not be thrown away lightly. In short, the way to revive today is to hope that all the people of the country can wake up, put aside selfish thoughts, and be open to each other. They can unite and arouse their sense of responsibility, and then they can talk about cooperation, then they can discuss national affairs together, and then the national crisis will have hope of being saved.</p>
<h3>Our Country Notifies Withdrawal from Tariff Truce Estonia Also Announces Withdrawal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Geneva, 16th - Our country officially notified its accession to the Tariff Truce Agreement established on May 12 of this year on June 16. However, the agreement stipulated that all countries may withdraw at any time after July 31 of this year by giving one month's notice. Due to factual needs, our country has notified its withdrawal on the 15th of this month in accordance with the above regulations, but this withdrawal shall take effect one month after the notification.

<h3>India-Japan Conference Japan Tired of Coping</h3>
<p>India Proposes Another Amendment</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Indian representatives attending the Anglo-Japanese trade conference in New Delhi still insisted on the classification method and made no concrete concessions. Therefore, the possibility of establishing an agreement is still very far away. The Japanese government will continue to do its best to promote the agreement, but now feels pessimistic, because the final proposal made by the Japanese government to India was obtained with great difficulty after the consent of manufacturers in Osaka. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the 12th Japan-India consultation, the final proposal presented by the Indian side, despite Japan's repeated concessions, stubbornly adhered to the original proposal and disregarded the fundamental principles of Japan recognized by the Indian side during the private talks between Sawada Yasushi on the 4th, such as "Japan can actually import 400 million yards of cotton cloth into India every year". Under a non-friendly policy, this final proposal was made, and regarding the distribution by variety, the Indian delegation accommodated the demands of the British mainland and unduly suppressed the import of Japanese bleached cloth. This is completely contrary to the intention of the Indian delegation to Japan to "India hopes to negotiate based on India's interests," which was expressed to the Japanese delegation. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the private sector expressed great dissatisfaction with the insincere attitude of the Indian side. (17th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Indian side failed to accept the Japanese side's final proposal for the Japan-India conference, and again proposed an amendment, requesting the Japanese side to reconsider. After coordination, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided not to allow the Indian side's amendment and telegraphed the Sawada representative in India. (17th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Immediately Announced Acknowledgment of Conditions Negotiated and Continued Discussions on Promoting Trade Plans</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is expected that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia will be announced this afternoon. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is now expected that the official statement of the United States recognizing Soviet Russia will not be delayed past tomorrow night. It is heard that after the President and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov continued their talks yesterday, they have now entered the stage of actually negotiating the draft of the terms of recognition. According to the White House today, this draft can be negotiated tonight or tomorrow morning. Once it is established, it will be followed by formal recognition. Therefore, today, American government officials have turned their attention to seriously considering plans to promote trade between the two countries, such as lending long-term loans to Soviet Russia by the US government to pay for the price of goods shipped to Russia, which is one end of it. In addition, increasing Russian exports to the United States is also under consideration. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The US and Russia Are in Great Need of Each Other, but Loan Matters Have Not Been Discussed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government will soon recognize the Soviet Union. Today, open-top military vehicles moved documents from the Soviet Russian Embassy in Washington. The embassy has been closed since the fall of the Kerensky government in 1917. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov now feels that the US needs Russia more than Russia needs the US. Therefore, his demands during negotiations are quite extravagant, currently demanding a credit period of five years or even longer. The special point of contention now is that President Roosevelt, under the National Recovery Administration, has the power to raise tariffs or completely prohibit the import of goods that the US does not want. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, when leaving the White House today, stated that if US tariffs are not reduced, the US may not be able to sell more cotton and livestock to Soviet Russia, because without tax reductions, Soviet Russia cannot afford to pay a high price. Wallace denied any talks with Soviet Russia regarding loans. Officials of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation also said that loan matters were not discussed. According to recent reports in Moscow, there have been hints that loan discussions might fail. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) While the US President was meeting with Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov until 1:00 AM, military vehicles entered the front of the former Imperial Russian Embassy. Military police were inside clearing the case files of the Imperial Russian government. This action was taken with Litvinov's consent to facilitate the handling of affairs by both governments at this time. Litvinov arrived at the White House at 9:00 PM tonight. The US President immediately left the cabinet meeting to receive Litvinov, talking until 1:00 AM. Later, when Litvinov and Secretary of the Treasury Woodin left the White House together, the journalists waiting outside the White House were surprised, as Woodin's participation in the talks had not been previously known. However, Woodin did not provide any details to the journalists, only saying that they would get news tomorrow. Litvinov said that there had been progress this evening. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, President Roosevelt and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov have decided to hold another meeting. The hope for an immediate resolution of the US-Russian negotiations seems unlikely to be realized for the time being. The issue of setting quotas for wheat exports seems to be one of the most difficult issues in the discussions. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt is now trying his best to persuade Soviet Russia to join the international gentlemen's agreement on this matter. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with President Roosevelt again tonight. Secretary of the Treasury Woodin, who is on leave, Acting Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, and Undersecretary of State Phillips were all present. The talks lasted for two hours. It is generally believed that the result was positive. President Roosevelt may initial an agreement soon, legally recognizing the Soviet Union. Political circles here believe that the negotiations between Roosevelt and Litvinov regarding Russian debt can be finalized before he departs for Warm Springs tomorrow. The Soviet Russian Embassy in the United States, which has been closed since the overthrow of the Kerensky Provisional Government, was guarded by police tonight. At the same time, several soldiers entered and removed a large number of files, loading them onto three trucks. The contents of these documents are related to the Russian debt issue and will be jointly reviewed in detail by Soviet Russian representatives and State Department personnel. The removal of these files was carried out with Litvinov's prior consent. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the talks between President Roosevelt and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, agreement has been reached on issues such as religious propaganda and US-Soviet trade relations. The Soviet government has abandoned its original stance, allowing the debt issue to be brought up for discussion and has accepted other US demands. In addition, Roosevelt and Litvinov also discussed the issue of world disarmament and Japanese-Russian relations. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>The US Treasury Secretary's Replacement Will Implement Controlled Inflation, Using Silver to Supplement Gold as Currency Reserves, Actively Promoting Gold Purchasing Plans at Home and Abroad, with Conflicting Opinions Among the American People</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, inflationists across the country rejoiced upon hearing the news of Morgenthau's appointment as Acting Secretary of the Treasury, believing that Woodin's leave from the department had removed a major obstacle in their plans. Morgenthau is scheduled to be sworn in tomorrow and will actively preside over the administrative affairs of the Treasury Department starting the day after tomorrow. Morgenthau has always advocated for reducing the gold content in the gold dollar to implement controlled inflation and firmly believes in the urgency and feasibility of inflation. He has expressed his personal conviction that increasing the currency in circulation will be more effective in promoting economic recovery than any other plan. Therefore, inflationists are overjoyed at Morgenthau's appointment as Treasury Secretary. In addition, silver advocates also believe that Morgenthau can at least be a gradual protector, as he opposes the free coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen to one but strongly supports using silver (at least a limited amount of silver) to supplement gold as a currency reserve. However, Morgenthau has not yet indicated what proportion silver should occupy in the US metal reserves in his estimation. Today, Morgenthau pledged to actively support the President's monetary plan, stating that he fully agrees with the President's views. He also praised Woodin. Woodin will soon go to Arizona for medical treatment. It is widely believed that Woodin may not return to the Treasury Department. This leave is a way for the President to save face and conceal the cabinet split. As for the monetary plan after Morgenthau takes charge of the Treasury Department, Morgenthau has not yet expressed his views today, but it is reported that he will actively promote domestic and foreign gold purchasing plans with Professor Warren, the leader of the inflationists among the President's brain trust. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some American businessmen predict that the government will stabilize the gold dollar at a price of fifty cents (i.e., reduce it by half). This move is expected to benefit commerce or may progress into a genuine upward market. However, what the future holds is still uncertain at this time. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that Meier, an assistant in rural lending, has been appointed as the Director of Rural Lending, filling Morgenthau's vacancy. Van Aelst was previously a professor of finance and agriculture at Cornell University. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) Rumors that the US government will try to prevent funds from flowing out of the country have spread, causing the US dollar to recover from $5.52 to $5.26 today. Foreign exchange traders predict that the government will issue an order tomorrow prohibiting the transfer of funds. There are also rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank is selling pounds and buying US dollars. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After it was learned here that the amount of government bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve Board had suddenly decreased, speculation abounded that the US President might be forced to adopt a direct monetary inflation policy. According to today's afternoon announcement, the amount of government bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve Board in the past week was only US$2 million, the lowest amount in several weeks. Purchasing government bonds in the open market is one of the important steps in the recovery plan and has been used as the government's main weapon to inject lifeblood into the commercial arteries. Therefore, some believe that the reduction in purchases by the Federal Reserve Board is a sign of stopping the credit inflation plan. However, the Treasury Department must exchange old bonds worth 7 billion yuan that are due before December 15. Maintaining the price of government bonds and government credit can be done after purchasing in the open market. If purchases are stopped, it is feared that the price of government bonds will fall. Therefore, this move will have an adverse impact on the government's plan to refinance old debts. It is unknown what motives the government has adopted in this action. Some others say that the Federal Reserve Board has admitted that it cannot sympathize with the President's monetary policy and does not approve of the continuous decline of the gold dollar. Regarding this matter, its Chairman Black, although he has not publicly stated, has also reportedly failed to fully agree with the White House plan. Also, Jones, the Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, commented on the government's gold purchasing policy today, saying that the New York Reserve Bank's purchase of gold abroad on behalf of the company is being taken too seriously. The United States will never be able to buy enough gold abroad to fill its teeth. He did not comment on the number of purchases already made. He also declined to comment on the reason for the stability and immobility of domestic newly mined gold prices in the past three days, only saying that the total value of gold purchased domestically this week was US$6,582,000. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Evening Post's financial reporter stated today that the American people will face the danger of printed bureau banknotes. Woodin's departure from the Treasury Department is insignificant. Although Woodin waved the flag of currency stabilization, his departure was a bow to the fantasy and reverie of those who do not know what currency is. Acheson's war to defend sound currency was also destroyed by the Roosevelt administration. As for the newly appointed Acting Secretary Morgenthau, who is neither trained nor prepared, it is impossible to seek the financial health of the United States when he suddenly becomes the head of the Treasury Department. We are now subject to a kind of financial experiment, and this experiment, based on logic and historical speculation, is bound to fail. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the balance sheet of loans published by the French West Bank today, the bank flowed out of gold worth 73,000 francs in the week ending November 9. However, the amount purchased by the United States was very small, and most of it was purchased by the British Equalization Fund to stop the rise in the pound's price. The paper money reserve is now 79.60%. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The number of unemployed workers in the United States continues to decrease. According to statistics released today by Secretary of Labor Perkins, 85,000 people found jobs in October, and the total amount of salaries paid increased by US$70 million compared to September. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to news from the New York Daily, Treasury Department advisor Sprague has resigned to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt did not immediately approve it. The Commercial Daily stated that Sprague advised the President to launch a large-scale demolition of slums and reconstruction of new houses plan to promote the recovery of the city. It is reported that Jones, director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, claimed that the amount of gold purchased abroad by the United States this week was minimal, and only 6,582,000 yuan was purchased domestically. The New York Daily pointed out that the impact of the gold plan is only psychological. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Franco-German Preliminary Agreement, French Officials Are Quite Satisfied, Guaranteeing Peace and Conforming to the League of Nations Policy, Direct Franco-German Negotiations Will Be Greatly Facilitated</h3>
<p>(Paris) As relations between Germany and Poland become increasingly moderate, with the hope of establishing a formal non-aggression treaty, French officials are quite satisfied with this point. French policy is aimed at creating an atmosphere conducive to peaceful construction, as mentioned by Peng Gu in the Lower House the other day. The rapprochement between Germany and Poland is in line with France's policy. France believes that countries should sign multilateral treaties to consolidate peace, which is in line with the policy of the League of Nations. This policy can make the League of Nations more stable. France is pleased that Soviet Russia and Eastern European countries, as well as Greece and Turkey, have signed non-aggression treaties. After the initial agreement between Poland and Germany is established, if France conducts direct negotiations with Germany, the French government's task will be greatly facilitated. Because from now on, France, while still maintaining its old alliance with Poland, will have resolved Poland's difficulties due to the rapprochement between Germany and Poland. France can concentrate on resolving Franco-German issues without having to be distracted by Poland. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Warsaw The German-Polish declaration of non-aggression was published yesterday by the Wolff News Agency. Polish officials regard this declaration as the first step in the rapprochement between Germany and Poland and stated that the two sides will continue negotiations to establish an economic agreement and a formal non-aggression treaty. It is expected that the economic agreement can be established soon, while the non-aggression treaty is far off in the future. Even the most optimistic people think so, as it is difficult to determine whether Hitler is willing to bind Germany's future with a policy suitable for the moment. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Geneva Is Bustling Again, the US Hopes Rome Will Convene a Four-Power Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon Foreign Deputy Eden departed for Geneva at 2:00 PM today, only staying in Paris for one hour. This trip is intended to discuss the resumption of the Disarmament Conference with Henderson and other leaders. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon Foreign Deputy Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow to discuss the resumption of the Disarmament Conference with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson and representatives from other countries. US political circles now hope to convene a conference of signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact in Rome. However, no matter what actions are taken in Geneva in the next few days, Britain still regards its disarmament draft as the basis for future work. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon Foreign Deputy Eden's arrival in Geneva was actually the result of Henderson's telephone conversation with the British Foreign Ministry early this morning. The situation has suddenly taken a turn, and there is a possibility of resuming the Disarmament Conference. According to Henderson, important officials from other countries are also coming, so it is expected that French Peng Gu, Italian Aloisi, and American Davis will all come here. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The trip of Foreign Minister Peng Gu of France and Foreign Secretary Simon of Britain to Geneva, and the British government's announcement that it still regards its proposed disarmament draft as the basis for future work, have attracted great attention from the German people. According to a Berlin correspondent in London, Simon has received clear instructions to advocate for the abolition of the so-called trial period, which Germany strongly opposes. Simon's first task is to discuss the location of the German issue with Henderson and representatives from France and Italy. Germany believes that the atmosphere in Geneva is special, so it does not want to hold a meeting there and considers Rome to be the most suitable location. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Little Parisian Daily today published a Rome telegram stating that the Italian government may issue invitations within days to hold a four-power conference in Rome. The newspaper expects that the Italian government will work hard to persuade France to attend this order. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Denies Secret Documents, French Newspaper Believes It Is Undoubtedly True</h3>
<p>(Paris) Germany and Poland have reached a new agreement, agreeing to directly negotiate various issues related to each other and not use force to define diplomatic relations. Political circles here have expressed deep satisfaction with this, viewing this agreement as sufficient to end the tense situation between the two countries. However, the Little Parisian Daily reported that Germany's adoption of a moderate attitude towards Poland is only temporary and that Germany will never give up its demands on Poland. French newspapers stated that this is enough to expose Germany's goals and methods. Berlin authorities declared today that the newspaper reports are purely fictitious, with the intention of poisoning the international political atmosphere. The Little Parisian Daily has guaranteed that its report is undoubtedly true and revealed that the German Central Propaganda Bureau has issued instructions to German committees abroad to try to win public opinion support for Germany's demands. Its ultimate goal is to restore the land around Germany inhabited by German minorities and its colonies. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>France Reorganizes the Air Force, Separates from the Army and Navy to Form an Independent Organization</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Air Force will completely separate from the Army and Navy and become an independent organization, following the British model. This bill was passed today in the House of Representatives by a vote of 528 to 19. The French Air Force will be composed of all flying squadrons stationed in France and overseas, and a Supreme Aviation Administrative Council will be established, with the Minister of Aviation as the chairman, to work with the Ministry of Aviation. In terms of numbers, France is already the strongest air force in Europe. It is still promoting aviation. Anyone who can manufacture a single-seat biplane light aircraft and sell it for £1,622 will receive a subsidy of 7,000 francs per aircraft. The new aircraft weighs only 687 pounds, has two cylinders, 35 horsepower, and a speed of 87 miles per hour. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Focuses on National Defense and Resumes Diplomatic Relations with Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Brussels The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives convened a meeting. Socialist member Piera discussed the German arms issue and suggested that if Germany continues to violate various treaties, the following measures should be taken to deal with it: (1) Economic sanctions, such as declaring the abolition of various commercial agreements with Germany and boycotting domestic goods; (2) Military sanctions when necessary. Members of the Natural Education Party opposed economic sanctions. Liberal member Bovair declared that the most reliable guarantee is to reorganize the national defense system so that France can intervene calmly when Germany invades Belgium. (According to the defense alliance signed between Belgium and France after the European War, the so-called French intervention refers to this.) Also, member Blumford advocated resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Saar Dispute, German Government Announces Baben's Mission</h3>
<p>(Berlin) French newspapers widely report that the German government has appointed Deputy Prime Minister Baben as the plenipotentiary to handle all Saar issues, intending to establish a protective system in the Saar region. The German authorities therefore issued a statement today, declaring that such concerns are unfounded and that Germany cannot unilaterally decide on the return of the Saar region to its original owner. The treaty has already stipulated the path to be taken. What France hopes for is that the relevant powers will abide by and protect this treaty. Baben's appointment is not to establish a special department, but to deal with all issues related to the Saar. Baben's special task is to prepare the necessary plans for holding a public assembly, the date of which will be decided by the League of Nations around January next year.

<h3>British Liberal Party Split, Samuel Faction Joins the Opposition Party</h3>
<p>(London) There was a very important development in British politics today. The Liberal Party members led by Samuel have now decided to join the opposition party from November 21, when Parliament convenes. This resolution was passed by a majority vote after the Liberal Party met in London for one hour and fifteen minutes to discuss. The strength of the Liberal Party under Samuel in Parliament is 32 seats, but some of them will still support the MacDonald government. The Liberal Party in the House of Lords is led by former Indian Governor General Lord Reading, but it is expected that Reading will not take the same path as Samuel. Tonight, Samuel gave a broadcast speech explaining his reasons for joining the opposition party, saying that the current cabinet lacks enthusiasm for disarmament and that those engaged in negotiations lack talent, so the progress of disarmament is not satisfactory. The Liberal Party he leads will be a detached party, with (1) peace, (2) reducing trade restrictions, and (3) actively seeking national development as its guidelines. Samuel, 63, served as Home Secretary in the MacDonald Labour government until the establishment of a unified national government at the end of 1932. After that, the Liberal Party split into several factions, some supporting the government, some following Samuel as the leader, and some supporting Lloyd George as the party leader, each differing according to their political views. Samuel was a student at Oxford and was elected as a member of the Lower House in 1902. He has written several books, including one called "Liberalism and Its Principles and Propositions," published in 1902. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>The British Parliament Will Adjourn, the British Emperor Orders Efforts to Achieve Disarmament</h3>
<p>(London) The current parliamentary session is coming to an end. In the Emperor's decree adjourning Parliament, he stated that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has disrupted the process, but efforts must be made to achieve international disarmament. He also stated that the British people continue to be willing to bear significant sacrifices, so Britain is uniquely able to maintain a balance of payments among the major countries. Britain has sound financial policies and adequate plans to protect industries, which can restore confidence. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>US Gold Hoarding Case Ruling, President Roosevelt Loses, Court Indicates Presidential Order is Illegal</h3>
<p>(New York) The first test case of violating the President's prohibition on gold hoarding has now been ruled by the court here as illegal, pointing out that the President has encroached on the powers granted to the Treasury Secretary by the Congressional Act of March 9. As for the charge against New York lawyer Campbell for failing to report cash worth 200,000 yuan deposited in the New York Chase National Bank, the court has not yet ruled. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) A federal judge ruled today that the US President's order to order gold hoarders to hand over all gold is illegal, but this judgment is based on technical aspects, because Congress entrusted the power to force the surrender of gold to the Treasury Department, not the President. This case involves a lawsuit by New York lawyer and insurance magnate Campbell against Chase Bank, demanding the return of 27 gold bars stored to test whether the US President's two administrative orders of April 5 and August 28 comply with the Constitution. It is now believed that the US government will appeal or issue an order through the Treasury Department to replace the previous order. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Cabinet Begins Discussion of the Budget: Military Expenditure Occupies a Large Portion</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet meeting on the budget was held on the 17th at 1:30 PM. Minister of Finance Takahashi explained the policy regarding the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The military expenses of the Army and Navy, in order to meet the needs of strengthening the national defense plan, have been approved for both the Army and Navy ministries within the scope of national strength.</p>
<p>(2) The expenses for the Manchurian Incident will be reduced in consideration of future equalization, but in view of the occurrence of new situations, reserve funds for the Manchurian Incident have been added to the budget of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(3) Expenses for relief of the current situation and promotion of industry, etc., for the restoration of agricultural product prices and new urban projects, will be further reduced in accordance with the changing circumstances.</p>
<p>(4) The increase in regular departmental expenses due to the establishment of new bureaus and sections and the increase in personnel will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the expenses of temporary departments, due to financial difficulties, all will be cancelled except for unavoidable emergencies.</p>
<p>Regarding the above explanation, because Army Minister Araki, Navy Minister Osumi, and others expressed dissatisfaction with the examination and determination of the Ministry of Finance Affairs Bureau, the examination and determination proposal was temporarily taken back to each ministry, and a ministry meeting was convened. The meeting adjourned after declaring that they would request a revival based on the results and that a decision would be reserved.</p>

<p>(Jiji News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the Ministry of Finance's decided budget for the next fiscal year, out of 201.7 million yen, the base budget is 140 million yen, and the approved new expenses are 62 million yen, which is a reduction of the total amount of 140 million yen requested by each ministry to about 44%. The content is: 16 million yen for the Manchurian Incident expenses of each ministry, 26 million yen for the military expenses of the Army and Navy, 6 million yen for the current situation relief projects, 10 million yen for public bond expenses, and 4 million yen for other expenses. Of this, 65% is occupied by the expenses of the Army. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi has decided to fully approve the main military expenses for the Army Ministry's war material preparation expenses, the Navy Ministry's second replenishment plan expenses, the aviation corps enrichment expenses, and the fleet improvement expenses. However, other new requested expenses have been greatly reduced. As for the new budgets of each ministry, they have also been reduced to the minimum amount. Therefore, the decided budget for the next fiscal year totals 201.7 million yen, a decrease of 29 million yen compared to this fiscal year. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi has made an explanation at the budget cabinet meeting, as reported previously. Mr. Takahashi hopes that each ministry will quickly decide on its attitude and report the situation to the Ministry of Finance by the morning of the 20th. Finally, each ministry will conduct business negotiations on the 18th and 20th. Each ministry must decide its attitude before the regular cabinet meeting on the 21st. This cabinet meeting adjourned at 3:40 PM. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's examination and determination budget proposal, Army Minister Araki returned to his office from the cabinet meeting on the 17th and immediately convened a ministry meeting to discuss the Army's attitude. The Army's newly requested military expenses for the next fiscal year, such as the Manchurian Incident expenses, were originally 160 million yen, and the war material preparation expenses were originally 180 million yen. This time, the Ministry of Finance has cut them in half. The Manchurian Incident expenses are based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol and are expenses for implementing national policy. The Army is dispatching the minimum necessary force and considering the reduction of expenses. Moreover, recently, the Soviet Union has concentrated troops on the Soviet-Manchurian border. Therefore, preparing troops in Manchuria is an extremely important plan. The reduction of the incident expenses is absolutely unacceptable. As for the war material preparation expenses, in order to cope with the major international crisis in 1936, they have been delayed due to the national economic situation. This is to prepare war materials. The majority of these expenses should be completed in the next fiscal year, and the remaining amount should be completed in the following year. Otherwise, it will not only hinder the war plan, but also create obstacles for the training of new weapons for the army. However, in the face of this crisis, a large reduction in expenses is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, a strong opposition has been raised against the Ministry of Finance's examination and determination proposal, and it is planned to request a large amount of additional funding. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Finance Minister Takahashi made the final decision on the budget for the next fiscal year, he issued a statement saying that the Japanese government's policy is to consistently adopt peaceful politics in diplomacy, but on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen national defense to defend against foreign insults. Therefore, the budget for the next fiscal year has decided to approve the military expenses of the Army and Navy, but the budgets of other ministries will have to be reduced as a result.

<h3>Spain's General Election Tomorrow: Forty-Four Parties Competing ▲ Number of Female Voters Exceeds Males ▲ Will a Dictator Reappear?</h3>
<p>Gibraltar Spain is scheduled to hold general elections on Sunday. Hundreds of British nationals and travelers from various countries fearing violence are pouring into this area to temporarily avoid the trouble. Special troops and police are stationed in the border area to maintain order. There are a total of 470 seats in the Spanish parliament and 7,000 candidates representing 44 parties. Women are particularly dominant, with female voters outnumbering men by 5% nationwide and 8% in Madrid. Hundreds of voting certificates have been stolen, indicating an attempt to vote twice by some people. The Conservative Party and the Socialist Party are the strongest forces and will fiercely compete. There are 451 Conservative candidates and 250 Socialist candidates. The Republican Party has announced alarming news that if the Royalists win the election, they plan to lead an army of 10,000 to invade Spain. Spanish fascism has emerged recently and is rapidly gaining momentum. The son of former dictator Rivera is also supporting this ideology. He is young, a good speaker, and has many supporters. It is widely believed that if this election fails to form a stable government and has a majority in parliament to support it, this parliament will be Spain's last, and a dictatorship will follow.

<h3>Trade Situation of Overseas Chinese in Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce recently convened a special meeting here to discuss trademarks, trade circulars, agency rights, copyrights, and the shareholder registration issue recently raised by the Straits Settlements Trade Commission. Representatives of various Chinese groups in Singapore, numbering about 100, attended the meeting. They all expressed approval for issues such as trademarks and trade circulars, but actively opposed shareholder registration, demanding that the Trade Commission revise it. At the same time, it was resolved to send two representatives to the Trade Commission to explain the reasons for their opposition: (1) Singapore is a free trade port, and implementing shareholder registration would be incompatible with this fundamental principle; (2) enacting this law will inevitably deter small-capital merchants, on whom Singapore's prosperity depends; (3) Chinese merchants will have difficulty complying with this order because shareholders change frequently, and some people only have a small portion of the rights under the official shareholders; (4) due to the decline in prices, some merchants have been unable to pay the taxes stipulated in the order.

<h3>Nationwide Silk Industry in Japan Freely Reducing Production</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Silk Reorganization Special Committee, established to discuss measures to address silk prices, met yesterday at the Sericulture Hall. As a result of the discussions, it was decided that although suspending industrial production is an effective temporary supply and demand adjustment measure, it is difficult to implement a nationwide shutdown at once. It was decided that each region should implement autonomous emergency measures, without implementing a resolution for nationwide silk production reduction, but rather implementing free production reduction. The committee will also attach to the regular general meeting on the 23rd of next month a resolution to "petition the authorities to maintain the exchange rate with the United States below 25 US dollars."

<h3>Nanjing's Measures for Banning Prostitution and Providing Relief are Scheduled to be Implemented Next Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The measures for banning prostitution and providing relief are scheduled to be implemented next year. The content includes: (1) Designating areas for controlled prostitution. The locations are south of Confucius Temple and Qinhuai River in the city, including the areas of Diaoyu Lane, Wensi Lane, Dong Guantou, Ding Guanying, Jinzawu, Da Xiaoshi Ba Street, and Wenderi in Xiaguan. Those operating outside the designated areas will be punished. (2) Restricting age. Those under the age of sixteen or too old are not allowed to be prostitutes. (3) Implementing inspections. Within a specified period, they must undergo inspections by health agencies, and only those without syphilis are allowed to operate. (4) Implementing relief. Prostitutes who cannot bear the physical life or the abuse of pimps can turn themselves in to the police局 and request relief. The relief measures include transferring them to relief homes and teaching them skills to support themselves in the future. Other measures include increasing prevention and strictly prohibiting foreign prostitutes, so that the number of prostitutes in the city is gradually reduced. According to the intention of the municipal authorities, the goal is to eradicate it within a certain period. Whether the goal can be achieved in the future remains to be seen after implementation. Under the current situation, prostitution is nominally banned, but secret prostitution is active, and the number of people suffering from venereal diseases increases year by year, which is harmful and not beneficial.

<h3>Reasons for the Delayed Establishment of the Ministry of Border Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Border Affairs Group of the General Staff Headquarters were merged to form the Ministry of Border Affairs, and a draft organizational law was also drafted, submitted to the Central Political Council, and passed in principle. The reasons for the delay in its establishment are: (1) The expenses of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission were originally 32,000 yuan per month. After the change to a ministry, the minimum amount needs to be increased by 30,000 yuan, totaling more than 60,000 yuan. Due to financial difficulties, it is difficult to increase the expenses. (2) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has a total of sixteen members. After the change to a ministry, there is only one minister and two vice ministers. It is difficult to arrange for the remaining members. Among the sixteen members, there are eleven people related to Mongolia and Tibet, including Zhang Ji, Panchen, Zhao Pilian, Tang Kesan, Bai Yunti, Ke Xing'e, Li Peitian, Cheng Yun, Awang Jianzan, Gesang Zeren, and Luo Na Hutuktu. It is not appropriate to move them rashly. (3) The reorganization of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was originally requested by Mongolia, and it was planned that after the reorganization, it would be managed by Mongolians. The Ministry of Border Affairs would manage border affairs, which would not be limited to Mongolians. (4) The number of personnel used for the reorganization is limited. It is not as good as the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, which can send relevant personnel to border areas at any time to handle border affairs. Unless a method to solve the above four points is found, the reorganization cannot be carried out rashly. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Salt Tax Collection Issue Still Requires Long-Term Consideration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li of the Ministry of Finance said that the collection of additional donations for the salt tax was a suggestion of the ministry's subordinates and was not advocated by Minister Kong. This matter is indeed a method of increasing revenue, but it is doubtful whether it is in line with Minister Kong's principle of increasing revenue without increasing the burden on the people. It needs to be considered for a long time and approved by the minister before a decision can be made. As for the establishment of customs posts at the various passes of the Great Wall, the ministry should handle it according to the resolutions of the Central Political Council. Before the central government makes a decision, the ministry cannot make a decision on its own. As for the Customs Administration drafting a concrete plan, that is not the case.

<h3>International Silk Conference Passes Resolution to Restrict Japanese Silk Dumping</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Paris on the 16th, the International Silk Conference passed a resolution on the 15th, advocated by the British representative, opposing the dumping of various Japanese silk products, and instructed the delegations of various countries to contact their governments to limit the import volume of Japanese silk products to a maximum of the average between 1927 and 1931. At that time, the representatives of the United States and Italy proposed to change this method to a suggestion to the Japanese silk industry because it was too harsh, but it was not passed.

Resolved: The case will be temporarily postponed for discussion. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Two Bombings Discovered at the Zhongyuan Company in Tianjin: Japanese Police Arrest Two Suspects</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7:30 AM on the 17th, someone threw a bomb on the fourth floor of the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese concession, destroying several pieces of wooden furniture. No one was injured.

<p>(Tianjin) At 10:30 PM on the 17th, another bomb exploded on the fourth floor of the Zhongyuan Company, destroying business counters. No one was injured. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the evening of the 17th, on the fourth floor of the Zhongyuan Company, a large department store on Asahi Street in the local Japanese concession, in the furniture and food department, near the northwest window, someone suddenly threw a bomb, which suddenly exploded at 7:00 PM. At that time, because customers were crowded, they fled for their lives, and chaos ensued for a while. The Tianjin Gendarmerie and consular officers from the consulate received reports and rushed to the scene, immediately sealing the entrances and exits of the company and searching for the perpetrator. As a result, four suspects were arrested and are currently under investigation. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries at the time. Only the glass windows and furniture in about three areas on the fourth floor were damaged, with losses of about two to three hundred yuan. Because the company sells Japanese goods, it has been noted, and its business will be greatly affected as a result. The consulate has arrested four suspects in the bombing of the Zhongyuan Company and is currently investigating. It seems that the real perpetrator placed the bomb in advance and fled.

<h3>Xinjiang Governor's Office Blocks Eurasia Aircraft from Flying to Dihua</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Sends Letter to Great Northern Telegraph Company Requesting Explanation for Flag Incident at Receiving and Sending Offices</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On this year's National Day, when various submarine cable telegraph receiving and sending offices in Shanghai hung the Party and National flag, they were suddenly obstructed by the Danish-owned Great Northern Telegraph Company.

Whenever a commemorative day requiring the hanging of the Party and National flag occurs, they should naturally hang the flag uniformly. This is an inherent right of sovereignty and is not subject to interference from any party. On this year's National Day, the submarine cable telegraph receiving and sending offices hung the flag as usual, which was perfectly appropriate. However, according to the International Telegraph Bureau's report, it received a letter from your company, treating it as an exceptional event, with the intention of obstruction. This is contrary to the principle of respecting sovereignty, which is deeply regrettable. We are hereby formally notifying your company that in the future, whenever our country's designated commemorative days require the hanging of the Party and National flag, we hope that you will not raise any further objections, so as to avoid causing misunderstandings. In addition to separately ordering the International Telegraph Bureau to forward this to the receiving and sending offices of all submarine cable telegraph bureaus for their information, please take note.

<h3>Ding Guitang Discusses Establishing Customs Offices at Various Passes of the Great Wall - We Have Sovereign Rights and Do Not Need to Negotiate with Japan - We Will Not Recognize the Establishment of Customs Offices by the Puppet State - Japanese Ambassador to Return to Shanghai Within Days After Completion of His Mission</h3>
<p>Beiping dispatch: The takeover of various passes of the Great Wall is currently being negotiated with the Japanese side, with the takeover from the Shanhaiguan side being the first step. Everything is being handled by Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese ambassador. However, the Japanese side is currently instigating traitors to actively prepare for the establishment of puppet customs offices at various passes of the Great Wall to engage in taxation. The authorities in Northern China, believing that if they do not find a way to respond, not only will foreign goods pour into the country without restriction, harming the national economy and people's livelihood, but also the outward transportation of domestic goods will be subject to illegal exploitation. Therefore, they are currently conducting an investigation. Upon receiving the results, they will report to the central government for approval and then establish customs offices at the passes to prevent this. According to Ding Guitang, the tax affairs official specially dispatched by the Ministry of Finance to assist in the establishment of customs offices, who spoke this morning, our country has the sovereign right to establish customs offices at the passes and there is no need to negotiate with the Japanese side. He is currently conducting a survey of the actual situation at each pass. Zhang Yongnian, the deputy tax affairs official, is responsible for the survey. Zhang had previously conducted a survey and yesterday departed again with Huo Shi, the section chief of the Jixian-Miyun Administrative Commissioner's Office, planning to first visit Gubeikou, then inspect the Malanyu and Luowenyu areas. He will return to Beiping within three to five days, stay for a short while, and then go to Tangshan, turning to the Jielingkou, Lengkou, and Xifengkou areas. After the survey is completed, he will return to Beijing to report. He himself (Ding) has been in Beiping for several days and has completed negotiations with all parties. He will also be going to Beijing within days. As soon as the establishment of customs offices at the passes is approved by the central government, it can be started. In addition to the major passes already planned such as Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Panjiakou, Lengkou, and Jielingkou, other smaller passes will also be established as needed, especially the upper reaches of the Luan River, because the Luan River has the advantage of waterways, and goods from the Rehe area usually go down the river. The establishment of customs offices outside the passes by the puppet state and the collection of taxes is completely illegal and our country will never recognize it. However, it is a matter of fact, and in the future, general merchants may suffer illegal losses, which is unavoidable. Our country will handle matters according to the original tax system, regardless of whether illegal facts exist or not, in order to protect national interests. Reports that the central government denies the establishment of customs offices may be misrepresentations, because the establishment of customs offices is our country's inherent sovereignty. There is no need to negotiate with the Japanese side, and it is sufficient to promote national interests. From Ding's remarks, it can be seen that the establishment of customs offices is progressing actively, which may soon become a reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the restoration of postal services, because the US Postal Association refused to allow the puppet state to participate and there are many complex relationships involved, it is difficult to realize for a while, and there has been no progress in recent days. Japanese Ambassador Arisaka has been in Beiping for many days and has secretly discussed Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Now that his mission has ended, he is scheduled to leave Beiping on the Shanghai-Peiping train at 8:00 AM on the 19th, heading south without stopping along the way, directly to Shanghai. If necessary, he will return to Japan from Shanghai to report everything in order to determine the policy towards China. The two administrative commissioner offices of Jixian-Bin County-Luanping-Yutian in the war zone, although they have started working, have not yet been formally established. There are reports that the two commissioners, Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, will go to Tongzhou and Tangshan to take office within days. After the ravages of war, the disaster areas of the war zone are followed by bandit disasters. The people are impoverished and financially exhausted. Although emergency relief has been provided, it is a drop in the bucket. All agricultural relief was originally planned to be implemented after the issuance of public bonds. The Public Bond Regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, but at this time of extreme financial stringency, sales are difficult. The disaster victims awaiting relief are in urgent need. The authorities are now planning to first distribute the 130,000 yuan donated by various parties. The remainder will be handled after the public bonds are issued. Personnel have been dispatched to various places in northern Beiping to investigate so that relief can begin. (November 16th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji Arrives in Fuzhou to Inspect, and Awards Honorary Flag to the 34th Regiment</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Zhang Ji recently went to Jiangxi representing the Central Government to award an honorary flag to the 34th Regiment of the 6th Division for its role in the battle of Xun Kou, Lichuan, and to comfort the troops engaged in suppressing the Red bandits and inspect the situation of the suppression campaign. Zhang departed from Nanchang by car for Fuzhou at 10:00 AM on the 14th, arriving at 11:00 AM. Gu Zhutong and other leaders from all circles in Fuzhou welcomed him at the station. Zhang rested briefly at Chiang Kai-shek's Fuzhou camp before going to the auditorium of the Northern Route Army Headquarters to hold the flag presentation ceremony. Representatives from all agencies and organizations in Fuzhou attended, numbering several thousand people. The meeting began at approximately 12:00 PM. Zhang personally awarded the flag, and Battalion Commander Tang of the 34th Regiment of the 6th Division accepted the flag on behalf of the regiment. After the ceremony, Zhang delivered a speech, first explaining the significance of the flag presentation, and then stating that internal troubles are like a heart disease, and the heart disease is the Red bandits. Without eliminating the Red bandits, how can we resist Japan? Yesterday (the 13th), the 36th Division of the 4th Division inflicted heavy damage on the bandits in the Xuwancun area, capturing countless items, which shows the dedication of the officers and soldiers. I will report this fighting spirit to the central government. Commander-in-Chief Gu then delivered a speech, thanking the Central Government for the special honor of the award, and saying that the 30th Regiment of the 6th Division, with over a thousand soldiers, resisted tens of thousands of bandits, breaking a mentality of fearing the bandits, which is greatly related to the future of the bandit suppression campaign, just like the Battle of Huizhou, which revived the revolutionary life. The Red bandits are traitors to the nation, and the Central Government, based on the principle of first securing the interior before resisting foreign aggression, has made a great determination, concentrating the nation's manpower and resources to carry out the suppression campaign. Zhutong and all the officers and soldiers should be particularly inspired to uproot them all. Finally, Battalion Commander Tang of the 34th Regiment responded with thanks, and the meeting adjourned. Zhang then went to inspect the 7th District Commissioner's Office and the Linchuan County Government, and originally planned to personally go to Nancheng and Jinxi in the front defense to inspect and comfort the troops, but was unable to do so due to circumstances. Therefore, he returned to Nanchang by the original car at approximately 3:00 PM, arriving in the province at 4:30 PM, and will return to the capital within days. (November 15th)</p>
<h3>Xu Yuanquan Telegraphs That the Communist Bandit Base is Completely Lost, and Bandit Gangs, Hungry and Cold, Surrender with Their Weapons; The Remaining Bandits in the Huangma Area Are Completely Suppressed</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Forward Headquarters received several telegrams yesterday reporting victories in the bandit suppression campaign, recorded below:</p>
<h3>Xu Yuanquan's Telegram</h3>
<p>Our army's Regiment Commander Xue and Jiang Ri led their troops to pursue and suppress the bandits from Nashui Creek to Huangnitang, capturing many items along the way, and accepting the surrender with their weapons of 42 bandit soldiers including Xie Zifa. According to the surrendered bandits, He Long has been tracked down and suppressed by the National Army for nearly a month, his base is completely lost, and his organization has been broken up. He is currently fleeing to areas without troops. It is also said that He Long is currently leading the Pseudo 9th Division and the Guard Battalion, with a total of more than 1,000 guns. More than 1,000 divine soldiers and bandits recruited in Li Xian have taken the opportunity to escape back, with only 200 or so people from Du Wanpeng's gang remaining. It is also said that the Red Army officers and soldiers are fleeing due to hunger and cold, in great distress, so they want to surrender to the National Army with their weapons. Therefore, He Long has executed many pseudo-regimental and battalion commanders. It is also said that He Long has repeatedly issued strict orders that no one is allowed to open fire without special orders, otherwise they will be charged with counter-revolution, because he is afraid that once contact is made, the Red Army will flee with their weapons. Most of the surrendered bandits are from Qianjiang and Mianyang, and they are afraid to return to the bandit gangs to promote surrender. Their weapons have been confiscated and they have been sent away. The number of prisoners captured by Regiment Commander Xue is being investigated in detail and will be reported later. Sincerely presented, Xu Yuanquan, songwu shi.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua's Telegram</h3>

A total of over 500 bandits were killed, over 200 bandits were captured, and over 30 guns were seized. The bandit corpses were everywhere, and the rice was burned. In addition to Dai Jiying's wife being identified among the captured bandits, the rest are being strictly interrogated. Liu Zhenhua, kou wei hai. (3) Sun Zongzhihui, Ma Shen's telegram, according to Peng Junzhang and Li Shizhang, the remaining bandits in the Huangma area have been completely suppressed after repeated and painful suppressions. The roads from Songbu to Xinji and from Qiliping Huang'an to Macheng can be traveled by individuals without hindrance. The motor road from Zhongguan Post to Zhongtudian Xinji is currently being repaired and is now open to Zhangdian. Liu Zhenhua, yang you. (4) The internal disintegration of the He bandits is widespread, and many who are hiding are surrendering with their weapons. The situation in various places seems to be caused by the military. In addition to supervising the various units to thoroughly suppress them to prevent future troubles, I respectfully report, Liu Zhenhua, chu kou. (November 15th Datong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Stone Dragon of the Zhou Dynasty Unearthed - Said to Be Obtained by King Wu of Zhou at Qishan - The Owner Actually Plans to Sell It to Japan Privately - Wang Hanming Asks Chiang to Preserve National Essence</h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch, Chiang Kai-shek recently received a letter from Wang Hanming, former commander of the Northeast Army, dated November 9th, stating that a friend of his had obtained a stone dragon unearthed in Huixian County, which was a relic of King Wu of Zhou and extremely valuable. It is said that in 1930, a stone dragon was unearthed in a certain place in Huixian County, with extremely fine carvings, head raised and coiled, glaring eyes, and extremely vigorous and simple. At first, the owner kept it secret and did not publicize it. Later, it became known to various circles in Tianjin and Beiping, and those who sought to visit it had to be prominent officials and celebrities to be allowed to see it. It is currently stored in Tianjin. Wang Hanming once saw this object. Wang recently learned that the owner plans to secretly transport it to Japan to sell it to the Emperor, which he felt was a pity. Therefore, he advised the owner to postpone the overseas transport and at the same time wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, asking him to purchase it with the intention of preserving the national essence. As for Huixian County, where the dragon was unearthed, it was the ancient state of Gongbo. In the Spring and Autumn period, it was the fief of Yu, the son of Wei Xi Hou. When Qin Shi Huang destroyed Qi, he moved King Jian of Qi to Gongxu. The Gong County was established in the Han Dynasty until the Sui Kaihuang period, when it was renamed Chengcun. In the third year of Jin Zhenhu, it was promoted to Huizhou, and in the Ming Dynasty it was downgraded to a county, and it still bears that name today. It is adjacent to Chaoge to the east. Chaoge was the capital of King Zhou. King Wu of Zhou destroyed Yin and enfeoffed Wu Geng, the son of King Zhou, in Chaoge, fearing that there would be floods in its western borders (i.e., Huixian), so he left this stone dragon statue to suppress it. Wang Hanming's letter stated that the stone dragon was obtained by King Wu of Zhou at Qishan, and after he eliminated the Yin Dynasty, it was auspicious wherever he went. Later, when Guan Shu rebelled, he also rose up after obtaining this object. Because of this object, the Zhou Dynasty had a prosperous reign of eight hundred years. Wang could not know its later fate. Looking at its exterior, it is golden and radiant. Knocking on it produces a golden sound, which is truly wonderful. However, this owner recently secretly planned to transport it to Japan to present it to the Emperor, which Wang felt was outrageous. However, it is not something that ordinary people can possess, and only those with great merit can have it. Therefore, he secretly stopped it and privately introduced it to you. If you have the intention of cherishing the national essence, you can send a learned gentleman to investigate it. If it is confirmed to be a treasure, it can be transported to you for judgment, but it must be returned to its original place if you do not want it, and the person should not take advantage of the opportunity to demand a high price. I have attached a photo. I am afraid the space is too narrow. I am confident you can see the truth. Your younger brother, Wang Hanming, November 9th. (P.S.) The stone dragon statue is 26 inches wide in the front, 34 inches wide in the back, 9 inches high when lying down, 13 inches high on the stone base, and weighs over 700 jin. The dragon scales are yellow, and the stone is black and shiny, like jade. Knocking on it produces a golden sound. Chiang, in addition to telegraphing Wang Hanming to stop the overseas transport, also sent archaeologists to conduct research. In the future, it may be acquired and displayed in the museum to promote national essence. The attached letter from Wang is as follows.</p>
<h3>The Life of the People in the Mengshan Mountains of Southern Shandong - Their Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation Still Have the Customs of Savages - They Are Illiterate and Do Not Know There is a Republic of China</h3>
<p>Feixian Dispatch, the Mengshan Mountains stretch across the counties of Lunan, Lintan, Feixian, Yi, Mengshan, Sixian, Xin, and Laiwu, extending over 200 li from east to west and over 100 li from north to south. The spring water is clear, and the mountains are covered with forests, producing famous medicinal herbs, exotic fruits, and minerals such as lead and tin. Due to poor transportation, few people have entered the mountains to mine them for centuries. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the people in the mountains still have the customs of savages. They often pick honeysuckle to take down the mountain to exchange for rice to eat, and their lives are extremely difficult. A special investigation of the production and savage life in the Mengshan Mountains is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Savage Life</h3>
<p>The savages within the mountains do not know how to farm throughout the year, only gathering mountain yams and honeysuckle to exchange for millet to eat. Their faces are dark and black, their voices are rough and dull, and they never wear shoes. The "Gangzi" (local name) on the soles of their feet are two inches thick. They are as agile as monkeys when climbing mountains and trees. They live in stone chambers, with each village having ten to dozens of families. They all elect the oldest and strongest person to manage the affairs of the entire village, much like the chieftains of tribal times. All disputes are brought to them for resolution. Marriage ceremonies are no different from those of the Ming Dynasty. Their nature is extremely barbaric. Outsiders, except for those purchasing medicinal materials, are not allowed to reside in the mountains for long, otherwise they will be assassinated. Living in the mountains, they do not know the years; when plum blossoms bloom, it is the new year. That is, when the plum blossoms are in full bloom, it is the new year. After work in autumn and summer, the village chief leads the entire village in jumping and celebrating at the foot of the mountain, and singing mountain songs. When there are weddings, the whole village goes to help and celebrate, showing a strong spirit of cooperation.</p>
<h3>Clothing and Dwellings</h3>
<p>The savages live in mountain caves or stone chambers. The chambers are built with huge stones and are about ten feet high, quite spacious. There are no doors, and holes are left in the walls to let in sunlight. Grass is laid inside as a bed, and the whole family sleeps in one room. Thin stone slabs are used as tables. The pots and bowls are still purchased from the interior. Their clothing is similar to that of the Ming Dynasty, all made of coarse cloth. Women still bind their feet. Their clothing is no different from that of men, except that they wrap their heads with rough cloth handkerchiefs. Although their language and actions are similar to those of the interior, none of them are literate. When asked about the era, they do not even know that there is a Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Products and Scenery</h3>
<p>Mount Meng is extremely rich in resources. Mineral products include gold, silver, lead, tin, coal, etc., in extremely large quantities. Other precious medicinal materials such as honeysuckle and cinnabar are also abundant. As for fruits such as red dates, mountain chestnuts, pears, and persimmons, they are too numerous to count. Because Mount Meng has abundant springs, various flowers and exotic trees grow luxuriantly, and the scenery is extremely elegant. Moreover, ancient temples and nunneries have been built in all dynasties, and there are many famous sites and scenic spots. If it can be developed in the future, it will greatly benefit the country and the people. Its beautiful scenery can be said to be superior to that of North China. A Feixian nursery rhyme says, "Mount Meng has nine heads, Feixian's water flows backwards, there are no second-rate local gentry, and honest officials never reach the end." "Mount Meng's nine heads" refers to the nine peaks. "Feixian's water flows backwards" refers to the Yi River, because the river water flows against the current. "There are no second-rate local gentry, and honest officials never reach the end" shows the strong and barbaric nature of the people.</p>
<h3>Corpses Everywhere</h3>
<p>Outside Mount Meng, there were originally more than three hundred villages, with a population of tens of thousands, all living by gathering honeysuckle. In the years of the Republic of China, 20 and 21, the bandit gang of Liu Guitang fled from Baodugu to Mount Meng, engaging in rampant slaughter and burning. Ninety percent of the people in the mountains died. Villages were set on fire and burned. Only a dozen or so were spared. Corpses are all over the mountains, a tragic sight to behold. This autumn, charitable gentry from Feixian organized a committee to bury the skeletal remains, going into the mountains to bury the corpses. As of now, more than seven thousand corpses have been buried. The harm caused by the Liu bandits to southern Shandong is indeed very great. (15th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Education Bureau Staff and County Magistrate Transferred for Examination</h3>
<p>Previously, the county party headquarters, based on a submission from citizen Gu Kelian, reported that education bureau staff members Chen Zulu, Wu Zhihe, Zhang Zhifu, and Yang Jiakai, as well as Shen Qiuxian, the principal of a primary school, were suspected of having a predilection for nephews (nepotism), requesting an investigation and handling. This was submitted to the executive committee meeting for discussion and resolution, requesting that the county government investigate and handle the matter according to the circumstances. (Today, the 17th) In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, the county government issued an order to Zhu Yansheng, the head of the education bureau, instructing him to bring Chen and the other four to the county at 5 o'clock. Director Zhu complied and had Chen and the other four report to the county, where they were immediately sent to the county's established academy and handed over to Dean Qiang Shaoxiu for examination. The county government also dispatched staff member Yang Yongnian, along with Yang Tianduo, a commissioned officer from the county party headquarters, to supervise the investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Three Organizations Request Postponement of Water Police Reorganization</h3>
<p>The county chamber of commerce, agricultural association, and education association, in order to request a temporary postponement of the reorganization of the water police, yesterday (the 17th) jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu provincial government's civil affairs department, stating: "Having read in the newspaper that the Jiangsu provincial water police will be partially reorganized and merged into one district, with the original sixteen teams reduced to four large teams, etc., due to the provincial treasury's financial difficulties, this measure is understandable. However, it is the height of winter, and bandits in various locations have not yet been completely eliminated. Our county borders Taihu Lake, and bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. Even with the existing police force, we are concerned that our reach is insufficient. Once the force is reduced, police strength will become even weaker, inevitably leading to a situation where we cannot attend to all areas. Merchants and residents are filled with anxiety. Therefore, we jointly telegraphically request that you consider the importance of defense and allow the current situation to be maintained, postponing the reorganization to ensure local stability."</p>
<h3>Wuxi Two Major Fires in the City</h3>
<p>The Guangming Grand Theater on the Library Road in the city of Wuxi was jointly organized by local residents Zhang Zailiang and others. It opened in February of last year, initially showing movies. Due to poor business, it was once converted to performing various dramas. However, performances were repeatedly started and stopped. By July of this year, it was announced that it would close. Recently, there were plans to reorganize and start again. It was originally scheduled to open today (the 18th). Unexpectedly, around 4 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), a fire broke out, destroying everything. Nearby residents rang gongs to warn others. Fire brigades from various districts of the city rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. By around 5 a.m., the fire was extinguished. The surrounding residences were fortunately spared. The entire building of the theater and its internal equipment were completely destroyed in the fire, with losses estimated at more than ten thousand yuan. However, the cause of the fire at the theater is quite strange. Furthermore, at the residence of Yang Chang, a 72-year-old woman, at number 9 Huangyan Bridge (also known as Fenghuang Bridge) inside Guangfu Gate, she got up to urinate at 1:20 a.m. yesterday and accidentally knocked over a kerosene lamp, igniting the mosquito net. Instantly, flames blazed fiercely, making it impossible to approach. At that time, the men and women, young and old, in the house were startled awake from their dreams and fled out of the house. Fire brigades from various districts arrived at the scene one after another and extinguished the fire at 2:20 a.m. Two upper and lower story buildings and one side room were burned down. The kitchen of the neighboring Mei Xin Printing Company, managed by You Hongchang, was also burned down.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Thirteenth District Captures a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>Xue Youben, the head of the 13th district of Wu County, knowing that Yao Tang Tie in the vicinity of Jintan had been looted by bandits, secretly ordered the police and militia under his jurisdiction to search for them. In places such as Xixi Tie, they captured six people, including Zhou Jinbiao, Chen Shixiang, Li Hailuo, Wang Youcai, Chen Wu's wife, and Zhou Hong's wife, and confiscated stolen goods such as cloth. After interrogation, the suspects confessed to robbery in Yaotang, Jintan, and Chengzhang Township, Wu County. District Chief Xue, considering the seriousness of the suspects' crimes, strictly guarded them and sent them to the county on the 16th and 17th for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Large Batch of Civilian Laborers Sent Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>The Nanchang Bandit Suppression Headquarters returned more than 400 civilian laborers. They arrived in Zhenjiang the day before yesterday. Except for more than 100 who voluntarily returned to their hometowns, the remaining 300 were given food rations by the Provincial Security Office according to the distance of their journeys and sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Wangying Township</h3>
<p>In Wangying Township, the fifth district of this county, around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, more than 20 bandits suddenly appeared, each carrying guns, looting, and burning eight civilian houses. Tan Shuren, the leader of the third squad of the police stationed in the town, led his team to resist. The two sides fought fiercely for more than two hours before the bandits fled towards the tenth district. Several police officers and bandits were injured in the battle.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Embezzlement of District Office Funds</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Fourth District Office received a total of 360 yuan per month for regular expenses and subsidies to the various townships in the district. In the past, the district office prepared a receipt and collected the funds from the county finance bureau. This time, the October funds were fraudulently collected from the county finance bureau on October 28 by someone holding a similar receipt. When District Chief Cheng Xuanting and the county bureau affixed their seals, they realized that the funds had been fraudulently collected. After negotiations with the head of the treasury section who made the payment, neither was willing to take responsibility for the mistake. District Chief Cheng specially presented a report to the county, requesting that the finance bureau re-allocate the funds. County Magistrate Jiang ordered the finance bureau to order the head of the treasury section to compensate for the funds, but Jin refused, so the matter has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Four Criminals Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Shao Jiachen, Chen Shoude, and two other criminals who shot and killed Pan Zhi, the district chief of the ninth district of Yin County, were captured by the military and police authorities in Ningbo and sent to the Provincial Security Office for investigation. Based on the conclusive evidence of their crimes, they were each sentenced to death. Upon receiving approval from the military commission, considering that the crimes were committed in Yin County, the criminals were escorted to Ningbo yesterday and executed by firing squad on Caoma Road on the north bank of the river.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Bandit Gang Looted Nan Shen Village</h3>
<p>Nan Shen Village in Xitang Township, which belongs to this county, has a sparse population, with only a few families, including the Chen farmers and the Shen family, who operate a fertilizer business. Last night, a gang of fierce bandits suddenly arrived, brandishing torches and firing guns as a show of force. They looted the village house by house, stealing seven stones of white rice and eighty silver dollars from the Chen family, and clothing and nearly one hundred silver dollars from the Shen family. The village is very close to Xitang Tie, but the bandits dared to be so rampant and unbridled, which is deplorable.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Fire at Water Immortal Temple Kills Two Children</h3>
<p>The weather in Xiaoshan has been dry and hot recently, and fires have been frequently reported in the surrounding villages. On the night of the 16th, a farmer named Zhou Jinchun near the Water Immortal Temple in the countryside accidentally caused a fire in his kitchen, which spread to three two-story buildings and five small houses. All 27 stones of rice could not be moved out in time and were also burned. Two children, aged five and two, were burned to death because the ladder on the upper floor had broken and they could not be rescued.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Said Situation in Fujian Will Not Change Hu Hanmin and Li Jishen Still in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning at 7:30. He got off the train at Zhenru Station and went directly to his private residence on Haige Road. At around 10 o'clock, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the municipal government. According to him, regarding the rumors of a political change in Fujian, he met with Chairman Lin in Beijing, who stated that there were no unexpected events in Fujian when he was there. It can be known that the various rumors circulating are completely unfounded and should not be believed. The Nineteenth Route Army had a great and glorious history during the war in Shanghai, and Chiang Kwang-nai and Tsai Ting-kai had previously issued a declaration that they would not participate in the civil war. Li Jishen is still in Hong Kong and has not been reported to be going to Fujian. The central government hopes that Hu Zhantang will come to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss national affairs together. However, he does not know whether Hu will come.</p>
<h3>President Wang and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Jia骅, the Minister of Communications, Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, as well as Chu Minyi and Ma Chaojun, all left Beijing by night express train last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony for Two Railway Planes Today Location: Hongqiao Airfield Time: 2 PM</h3>
<p>The naming ceremony for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway planes has been scheduled for 2 PM today at Hongqiao Airfield. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initiation The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a memorial meeting on January 28 this year to commemorate the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. More than 100 representatives from various party, government, and labor sectors of the two railways attended. Distressed by the brutality of the Japanese army and the lack of defensive weapons in our country, they believed that to seek the survival of the nation, it was necessary to first prepare for the consolidation of national defense. Upon the proposal of Mr. Li Dasan, a donation was raised for Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo planes to assist the government in building the air force. The proposal was unanimously passed on the spot and submitted to the Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways for resolution. A Fundraising Committee for Air Defense of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was organized. The Party Department selected four responsible representatives, the Railway Bureau four, and the Labor Union three. In addition to the four members initially selected by the Party Department, Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Zou Zhengjian, and Chen Fuhai, the Railway Bureau later replied by letter, recommending Yuan Boyang, Deputy Director of General Affairs, Yuan Shaochang, Deputy Director of Affairs, Zhong Guidan, Deputy Director of Mechanical Affairs, and He Yongyuan, Director of Accounting. The Labor Union replied, recommending Directors Min Luobing, Chen Bohua, and Feng Qishu, for a total of eleven people. This is a rough outline of the initiation.</p>
<p>Organization The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, after receiving the nominations from all parties, convened the first meeting of the Fundraising Committee for Air Defense of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways on February 24. The committee passed the regulations, elected Yuan Boyang, Chen Chengshi, and Li Dasan as standing committee members, and He Yongyuan, Chen Fuhai, and Zou Zhengjian as members in charge of managing donations. Min Luobing and Chen Bohua were appointed as directors of the general affairs group, Feng Qishu and Min Luobing as directors of the publicity group, Zhong Guidan and Chen Fuhai as directors of the design group, and Yuan Shaochang and Zou Zhengjian as directors of the fundraising group. Xie Chengyu, the secretary of the Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, was hired as the general manager. The methods for soliciting donations were stipulated. In addition to the central government's order for patriotic aircraft donations, which did not count for six months, another 150,000 yuan was raised. After a decision was made, the project began, and it was only completed after many difficulties. The determination and perseverance of the various committee members are admirable.</p>
<p>Preparation Due to the fact that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway employees already had the burden of the central government's six-month aircraft donation, it was difficult to solicit donations from the employees, so the planning of the fundraising committee of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway was designed to be based on the employees and not harm the current lives of the employees. The fundraising method was then formulated and revised. The following is an excerpt: (1) Appropriation of 45,000 yuan from welfare funds, (2) Appropriation of 35,000 yuan from the two percent bonus reserve fund for retirement, (3) Appropriation of 16,000 yuan from the Northern Expedition donation, (4) Appropriation of 15,000 yuan from the memorial hall fund. After submitting the proposal to the Railway Bureau for implementation, the Railway Bureau stated that the first item, the welfare fund, belonged to the employees of the two railways. If the employees agreed, the entire welfare fund could be appropriated according to the required amount, and the other items (2), (3), and (4) would no longer need to be discussed. To respect the opinions of the employees, the plan was submitted to the employees of the two railways for a vote. At the same time, the air defense committee issued a letter to the colleagues of the two railways regarding the fundraising for the purchase of aircraft to defend against insults and save the country, and sent personnel to the two railways to publicize the plan. As a result, the majority of employees agreed, and some even argued that this alone was not enough to fulfill the people's duty and that efforts should be made to raise more funds. The patriotism of the employees of the two railways is commendable. Since the Railway Bureau had obtained the consent of the employees to appropriate the welfare fund, it replied to the Party Department and the Air Defense Committee, stating that the total welfare fund for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways was more than 119,000 yuan, which would be appropriated in full. With the funds in hand, the Air Defense Committee sent personnel to the Aviation Administration to discuss the method of ordering aircraft. In order to expedite the process, it was decided to order an Eagle-type destroyer from the Curtiss Aircraft Factory in the United States through the China Aviation Association. Approval was given to proceed accordingly. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft were thus successfully completed.</p>
<p>Committee After the successful purchase of the two railway aircraft, the Air Defense Committee recommended Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Zou Zhengjian, and Chen Fuhai (Party Department), Yuan Boyang, Zheng Baozhao, Chen Sicheng, and Li Yiqiu (Railway Bureau), and Min Luobing, Chen Bohua, and Xue Jie (Labor Union) to form the eleven-member naming ceremony preparatory committee. Liu Xiong was hired as the director of the general affairs group, Tan Gengxin and Ding Boyi as the directors of the horse management group, Wang Cheng as the director of the publicity group, Chen Pin and Xu Duren as the deputy directors, Wei Yunlou as the director of the public relations group, Liu Junming and Yang Youren as the deputy directors, Cao Sheng as the director of the arrangement group, and Chen Sicheng and Zhang Yunhe as the deputy directors. In addition, many staff members were hired in each group to actively carry out the naming ceremony preparations.</p>

In addition, 100 large white cloth banners, 1,000 paper banners, 380,000 small banners, and 20,000 letters to the national compatriots have been hung along the route. The original text of the letter to the national compatriots is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to Compatriots Letter to the national compatriots regarding the naming of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft. Beloved compatriots, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft are holding a naming ceremony today. After the naming ceremony, we will contribute it to our National Government for national defense purposes. Our colleagues on the Two Railways have been engaged in the aviation-saving-the-country movement for several years, and have finally achieved the naming goal today. Here, under a slight sense of relief, we feel a deep sense of anxiety and shame. We are worried about the danger to the country, and we are ashamed of our weak ability. However, we are somewhat comforted that we can contribute a little to the country and add a weapon to national defense. However, when we further look forward to the dense war clouds in the Far East, examine the poverty and weakness of our own national strength, and look back at the struggles and undertakings of the late General Sun Yat-sen, we feel even more fearful and ashamed. The great cause that the General left us has not yet been completed. National defense is weak, social and economic conditions are poor and chaotic, the Red bandits are rampant, the warlords are divided, and the haze of world war is heavily shrouding the skies over the Far East. The bombs of war will fall on the vast land of China. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. However, we will never sit and wait for death. We must struggle for survival. For the sake of peace and self-defense, we must resolutely arm ourselves. Internally, we must adjust and develop the social economy. Externally, we must build a complete and strong national defense force. Beloved compatriots, our country is approaching a critical juncture of survival or extinction. Our nation is approaching the fiery line of a decisive battle for survival. We must work together under the leadership of the government to move forward and struggle. Seek light in the darkness. Beloved compatriots, in future wars, the air force will be the main force in combat and victory. In the battles in the Songhu and Great Wall areas on January 28, the military aircraft of Japanese imperialism have shown the world the effectiveness of air combat, far exceeding the facts and experiences of the army and navy. During the European War, aircraft were only in an auxiliary position in military affairs. However, in recent years, due to the increasing acuteness of international contradictions and the actual verification of the effectiveness of the air force, the powers have been expanding their air forces in a frenzied manner. Therefore, the scope of future wars will be from planar to three-dimensional, and the speed of war will change from the slow land and sea marches to the rapid airplane marches. Looking back at our country's air force equipment, we do not even have an aircraft carrier, and there is no adequate construction of air stations and air highways. As for the equipment of fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, bombers, and destroyers, it is pitifully young. Beloved compatriots, in this serious and extraordinary period, we must catch up quickly, recognize the goal of "saving the country by air," and catch up. Our only task at present is to assist our government and strive to expand the strength of the air force to establish a strong force for world peace and national self-defense. Beloved compatriots, we are very ashamed. We have collected donations from our employees on the Two Railways, and what we have contributed to the country is only this Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou aircraft. However, we dare to say that this is the beginning of our Two Railways colleagues' contributions to the country, and we will work harder to repay the country in the future. However, we still need the people of the whole country to share the idea of ​​sharing the survival of the country, unite, and do our best to achieve success based on the goal of "saving the country by air." Therefore, at the time of naming the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft, in addition to our national sense of excitement, we also hope that the people of the whole country will deeply understand and earnestly practice the "aviation-saving-the-country" project, which is critical to the survival of the country, and not only for the good fortune of our country, but also for the great fortune of world peace.

In addition to continuing to appeal to the government and charitable organizations in Shanghai for help, they also sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, urging them to quickly find a way to eliminate the Red bandits and pacify Sichuan.

<h3>Two Million Piculs of Hunan and Anhui Rice Are Shipped to Guangdong; Hunan Starts Shipping First; Anhui Province Is Arranging Ships</h3>
<p>The provinces of Hunan and Anhui have had excellent autumn harvests in the past two years, with rice and grain piled up like mountains. This spring, they were shipped to Nanhua for sale, but due to heavy taxes and high costs, the effort was halted. Now that an order has been received to exempt rice and grain from export taxes, the Hunan and Anhui authorities are transporting large quantities of white rice to Guangdong and are already loading it.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Hunan Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The central government issued an order allowing rice and wheat to be exported without taxes. The cost of Hunan rice entering Guangdong has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the authorities of Hunan and Guangdong provinces negotiated to transport one million piculs of rice and grain to supply the food needs of Guangzhou. The first batch, through the Hunan Provincial Grain Production and Sales Cooperative Committee, entrusted a British ship to transport 20,000 bags from Changsha to Shanghai first, and then transfer them to Guangdong. All taxes were waived. Currently, a large amount of rice and grain is urgently awaiting loading. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Kuaili Wheel to Changsha to transport this rice to Hankou, and then transfer it to Guangzhou by Yangtze River ships. Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have also dispatched ships to Hunan to compete for the transportation of this rice to Shanghai, and then transfer it to Nanhua seagoing vessels.</p>
<h3>Anhui Rice Is Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Construction Department has also sent personnel to Guangdong to discuss sales matters for transporting Anhui rice to Guangdong. An agreement has been reached. The Anhui Provincial Construction Department has decided to transport one million piculs to Guangdong. However, regarding the issue of loading ships, they are in contact with various Chinese-owned river steamers in Shanghai, requesting especially low prices. Negotiations are currently underway. Once finalized, ships will be dispatched to Wuhu to load Anhui rice for transport to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends He Molin to the United States to Handle the Shipping of Cotton and Wheat and Chartering of Ships; He Will Depart the Day After Tomorrow on the Russian Empress</h3>
<p>The central government has entrusted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with full authority over borrowing U.S. wheat and its transportation. In order to facilitate the chartering of ships and the return of goods, the company contacted Everitt, a U.S. businessman at the Fulae Foreign Firm, intending to have Fulae handle the ship chartering matters, while the company would handle other issues itself. On the 10th of this month, a draft contract for handling ship chartering was drawn up and submitted to the board of directors for review. However, this case has now changed, and the company will handle the ship chartering matters itself. Liu Hongsheng has dispatched He Molin, the head of the business department, to the United States to handle this matter. A summary is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Contract Cannot Be Approved</h3>
<p>The ship chartering contract signed between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fulae only concerned the chartering of seagoing vessels for transporting wheat; other matters were not related. The draft contract was submitted to the board of directors for deliberation. The board of directors believed that the chartering of ships could be done without the help of foreigners. In this time when shipping industries in various countries are depressed and tonnage is surplus, the company can handle it itself. Therefore, the contract could not be approved, and the ship chartering matter has changed.</p>
<h3>Sending He Molin to the United States</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of shipping U.S. wheat and chartering ships, the company has decided to handle it itself and will no longer entrust it to foreign merchants. The previous draft contract for chartering ships could not take effect because it was not approved. Liu Hongsheng considered this matter to be of great importance and specifically proposed a board meeting to decide that the company should dispatch He Molin, the head of the business department, to the United States to handle the ship chartering and wheat loading matters. After the decision was made yesterday, He Molin was consulted about all the steps to be taken in the United States. As for the vacancy of the head of the business department, it will be temporarily filled by the deputy head, Chen Daqing.</p>
<h3>Departing by Ship the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>He has prepared everything according to his commission. However, because the U.S. wheat urgently needs to be loaded and cannot be delayed any longer, He purchased a passenger cabin on the Russian Empress, a ship of the Changxing Company, yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 20th. He will first land at Vancouver and then transfer to Port of Portland, where the wheat will be shipped, to negotiate ship chartering and other matters. It is said that He's trip will take at least three months to complete and return to the country.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Dumped, Affecting the Chinese Domestic Cotton Fabric Market; Efforts Begin to Create a Sales Network</h3>
<p>The China National Cotton Fabric Market Co., Ltd. on Guizhou Road, Nanjing Road, is a new organization to resist Japanese yarn and fabric. It is said that, according to the company's estimates, in terms of yarn alone, it can reduce the amount of Japanese yarn by about 6,000 bales, worth more than 800,000 yuan, per month. The extent to which Japanese fabric will be reduced has not yet been accurately calculated. It is reported that the company's preparations are now complete and will begin operations on the 21st of this month. The opening date will be announced separately. Since the 12th, the company has been in contact with major companies in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai China National Products Company, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun department stores, as well as more than 100 cotton fabric merchants, such as Hengfeng, Baodaxiang, Taichangxin, Yuanxintai, Tongkangxiang, Xinkangxiang, Hengfengyu, Qingchangxiang, Jinfengxiang, Xiexinchang, Dachang, Xietaiyuan, and Tongchunxiang, to jointly promote the main goal of national salvation through production. The major companies and cotton fabric merchants believe that the company's aims are far-reaching and have all agreed to provide unanimous support and sympathy. The atmosphere is extremely enthusiastic. Currently, a sales committee is being organized, inviting major companies and cotton fabric merchants to join in the guidance, in order to complete a sales network.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau Actively Expands Business; Upgrades Border-Crossing Telephones; Constructs Branch Offices in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications abolished the telephone fees in the Chinese Concession, it has actively dismantled and upgraded cross-border telephones. It is estimated that since dismantling and upgrading began on September 1, 25 lines have been completed to date. The Telephone Bureau has decided to supplement the remaining 263 lines that have not been dismantled from the No. 0 switchboard and then dismantle them all. There are rumors that the Telephone Bureau will shorten the number of times users in the Chinese area are transferred to telephones in the concession. Liu Yujing, the head of the document section of the bureau, told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency that the Telephone Bureau has no such plan. As for the branch office in the city center, the bidding for its construction is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month in Nanjing and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. In order to prevent errors, if construction is not completed by the end of the year, telephones to the city center will be transferred through Jiangwan. As for the Pudong branch office, it can be completed by the end of December. The Telephone Bureau plans to begin upgrading telephones this month, installing the 800 common battery telephones brought from the ministry in Pudong, and moving the original 300 automatic telephones in Pudong to the city center. As for the cross-border submarine cable in the concession, it will be accepted and paid for after the installation project is completed. The Telephone Bureau has also begun bidding for the project to upgrade the automatic telephones in the Longhua branch office. As for the long-term contract for telephones on roads built across the border, since Gu Deming, a counselor dispatched by the ministry, has been conducting research together with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau, a draft agreement has been drawn up based on the temporary contract signed with the concession telephone company this year. Counselor Gu has taken it to Nanjing, and it has been repeatedly reviewed by the ministry. Counselor Gu has recently come to Shanghai again and is scheduled to hold a meeting with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Telephone Bureau within the next few days to discuss it. According to sources from the municipal government, the contract will be discussed once more and then the concession telephone company will be notified to discuss its implementation.</p>

<h3>Wheat Can Be Transported According to the Progressive Rate Reduction Method; The Ministry of Railways Ordered the Railway Bureau to Comply Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that wheat can be transported according to the progressive rate reduction method. Yesterday, it specifically sent a telegram ordering the two railway bureaus to comply. The original text reads: "To the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus: According to the Responsible Transportation Regulations, the freight rate for special-priced goods is the same as that for sixth-class goods. Without special permission from the railway, responsible transportation is not required. However, for wheat, many railways have special prices and charge fees with a fifth-class discount. Regardless of whether the special price is equal to or lower than the freight rate for sixth-class goods, all railways should be uniformly responsible for transportation and responsible for joint transportation in accordance with the progressive rate reduction method for joint transportation of goods attached to the Ministry's Joint Order No. 6732. Please comply accordingly. Minister Gu Mengyu, cold industry seal." It is reported that after receiving the order, the bureau has forwarded it to the traffic department for compliance.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau Extends the Free Storage Period for Goods in Warehouses; The Extension of Six Months Starts from September 16; The Maigen Road Station Changes from Seven Days to Five Days</h3>
<p>Previously, both railway bureaus provided a seven-day free storage period for goods stacked in railway warehouses by merchants. After the implementation of responsible transportation of goods, this was changed to 24 hours. This time limitation was necessary before additional warehouses were added. In May and June of this year, merchants complained that goods shipped from various places could not be cleared on the same day, and that the storage fees were too high. They requested an extension of the free storage period and a reduction in the storage fees to alleviate business difficulties. The bureau also recognized this need and decided to extend the free storage period to seven days and appropriately reduce the storage fees. This was submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and was implemented on a trial basis for two months starting from June 15. Since the implementation, merchants have found it convenient, and the railway's freight business has also increased. Therefore, after the two-month period expired, it was resubmitted to the ministry for approval to extend the period for another six months. However, due to the arrival of new goods at the Maigen Road freight station, the entire warehouse was full. In order to alleviate congestion, in addition to building temporary sheds for storing goods, the free storage period for goods in the warehouse was temporarily reduced from seven days to five days starting from November 3 to prevent goods from being stored for too long and to ensure that newly arrived goods could be accommodated, thus avoiding a sense of unequal benefits among merchants. In addition, the storage fees for fourth-class and lower-class goods are also temporarily charged at the storage fee rate for third-class goods (five cents per ton per day) as compensation. Once the warehouse congestion is slightly alleviated, the original situation will be restored. As for other stations, except for tea, which has separate regulations, the original method of seven days for imported goods and 24 hours for exported goods will continue to apply, and no storage fees will be charged.</p>
<h3>Measures for Collecting Taxes on Parcels Passing Through Customs; The Ministry of Finance Ordered Customs to Comply Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of inspecting and collecting taxes on parcels, the Ministry of Finance consulted with the Ministry of Communications and ordered the postal bureau to negotiate with the tax commissioners to formulate "Measures for Inspecting and Collecting Parcel Taxes." The measures have been jointly negotiated by the Directorate General of Posts and the tax commissioners and have been reviewed in detail by the Ministries of Finance and Communications. Six articles of revised measures for collecting customs duties on parcels to and from the interior have been drafted, and the Ministry of Finance ordered customs to comply yesterday. The Daily News Agency reporter has obtained the original text of the measures as follows: (1) Parcels to and from the interior that pass through two or more commercial ports will be inspected and taxed by customs, except for those that are tax-exempt according to regulations. However, if commercial goods transported along the same route are exempt from customs duties, then postal parcels will also be exempt from taxes. Parcels that only pass through one commercial port will be exempt from inspection and taxation by customs. (2) Parcels mailed by land or rail in the interior will be exempt from inspection and taxation if the places they pass through are not within the customs taxation scope. (3) For parcels that are subject to inspection and taxation, the opening, inspection, and resealing will be jointly handled by customs and the postal bureau. (4) The tax on parcels that are subject to taxation will be estimated by the customs at the last commercial port. (5) The customs duties to be levied on parcels will be collected by the postal bureau at the destination of the parcel according to the tax amount estimated by customs, and 10% of the total amount will be deducted as a handling fee for the postal bureau's collection, with the remaining amount remitted to customs. The postal bureau may collect the required exchange rate difference from the taxpayer due to the different currency systems in the two places. (6) These measures will take effect after being approved by the competent authorities of both customs and the postal bureau. The detailed regulations for implementation will be determined separately.</p>
<h3>Land Survey Implemented in Shanghai County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County government has been actively carrying out the land survey in accordance with provincial orders and has appointed Zhou Sisui as the chief clerk of the preparatory office of the land bureau. The provincial land bureau has ordered Dong Zhiyun, the leader of the eighth team of the first branch of the survey team, to come to the county with the team members to begin measuring and setting up control points. They have been going to various districts in recent days to carry out their work.

<h3>Donating a Large Batch of Printed Cloth to the Family Members of General Wang Delin's Troops</h3>
<p>Recognizing that many family members of General Wang Delin's troops, who are resisting the Japanese, are being accommodated and provided with meals and lodging by the Shanghai Xinwei Relief Society, but still lack quilts for warmth at night in this cold weather, the Jingxing Weaving Factory specifically donated seven large bales of old cotton, weighing approximately 200 pounds, to the Xinwei Relief Society yesterday to be distributed to General Wang's family members for making quilts. It also expressed to Ge Yunsun, the director of the society, its willingness to donate several yards of bedsheet cloth. It is learned that the Xinwei Relief Society has sent Director Ge with a letter to claim this bedsheet cloth.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Conducts Commercial Statistics; Fifteen Business Committee Members Are Appointed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened its 55th standing committee meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Wang Xiaoji, Wang Yansong, Lu Wenshao, Bei Songsun, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, and others attended. Luo Qinghua, director of the business department, proposed that commercial statistics be conducted in accordance with the resolutions of previous member conferences and that representatives be selected from various industries to form a business committee to manage the matter and requested a public decision. The meeting decided to approve the proposal and invited Xu Jiru, Pei Yunqing, Shen Huachen, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Wenqi, Zheng Jiangnan, Wang Ziqiang, Zhang Peizhen, Ge Jechen, Zhang Nianxuan, Mao Chunpu, Lu Wenshao, Zheng Chengqing, Li Wenjie, and Luo Qinghua to serve as members of the business committee, and designated Luo Qinghua as the convener. The following is an appendix to the statistical plan: "Conducting commercial statistics is a heavy and complicated task. The types of industry and commerce in Shanghai are complex and the area is vast, so it is impossible for a small number of people to complete the task in a short period of time. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a business committee based on previous resolutions to assist the department and collect opinions from all sides. The members will be selected from representatives of various industries, with no limit to the number, depending on the actual needs. It is now proposed to select the following representatives to serve as members, and your approval is requested. The list of candidates is as follows: Xu Jiru (Banking), Pei Yunqing (Money Exchange), Shen Huachen (Silk), Chen Songyuan (Cotton Cloth), Zhu Wenqi (Cotton Weaving), Zheng Zenan (Sugar), Wang Ziqiang (Silk Weaving Factory), Zhang Peizhen (Paper), Ge Jechen (Woolen Fabric), Zhang Nianxuan (Rice), Mao Chunpu (Coal), Lu Wenshao (Camel Wool), Zheng Chengqing (Dried and Fresh Goods), Li Wenjie (Banking and Statistics Expert), Luo Qinghua (Silk Fabrics). As for the implementation procedures, it is proposed to first print and distribute forms to various industry associations for reporting, and then the business committee will decide on the order. The director will then send personnel to conduct industry statistics. It is hoped that it can be completed in one year. This is not intentionally slow, but due to the limited finances of the association, it is not possible to fully employ the necessary personnel. It is proposed to temporarily add one specialist and two assistant staff members to the original statistics section of the department. With so few people, the work will naturally require collective effort and cannot be completed quickly. It will only be possible to complete the statistics for one industry at a time. If this is continued persistently, success will be achieved in the end. After that, there will be rules to follow, and progress will be easier. What should be done in the end? Your review and guidance are requested."</p>

In particular, wages are being paid below the contractual stipulations, and the 'public commission' item has been completely eliminated. Moreover, it has been found that those violating the old conditions include businesses numbered 2, 5, 5, 11, and 12, etc. We are attaching the previous agreement and respectfully request your review and immediate order for the sellers to strictly adhere to the labor-management contract and refrain from violating it."

<p>Notice of Resumption of Work: The silk and satin cloth offices issued a notice yesterday stating: "Notice for the purpose of notifying, in accordance with the fact that all workers in this office and others, after a month of upholding their wages, have now reached a resolution. Now that the workshops have presented a guaranteed wage contract to the association, and after review, it is no different from the originally agreed contract. All workers in your workshop who receive this notice must resume normal work from today. For fear of incomplete knowledge, this notice is specially issued."</p>
<p>Public Association Notice: After the dyeing industry workers in this city had a dyeing strike over the wage issue, which was resolved through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, the Dyeing Industry Association issued a notice yesterday stating: "Notice for the purpose of notifying, in accordance with the fact that this committee is actively planning and carrying out three major initiatives: business rectification, dyeing prices, and association affairs. Regarding the part about rectifying dyeing prices, after consultation with the Silk and Satin Association, it has been agreed to fully implement the dyeing price agreement signed by the Municipal Government's Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce sixteen years ago, as well as the unit price list approved in the 19th year, and to supplement the restrictions on the length of new electrically powered crepe fabrics, which has come to an end. Regarding business rectification, because the crux of the matter is deeply rooted, it is not enough to proceed with planning for a long time to achieve business perfection. As for association affairs, we are now soliciting members of the industry to join the association in order to create a sound organization so that we can exert full power internally and externally to deal with everything. A public announcement has already been made in the newspaper. In recent days, a large number of colleagues have enthusiastically obtained application forms and legally joined the association, but there are also many who are watching and not acting. Being in the industry and remaining unaware of the connection between themselves and its interests is regrettable. Now that the labor strike has been resolved, the steps for resuming work should be limited to members of this association. If non-members who have not come to the association to obtain a certificate and sign a labor guarantee contract, the labor side will not start work and the association will not be able to provide protection. This matter concerns the important interests of the industry, and a special notice is hereby issued for awareness."</p>

<h3>Two Young Men Commit Suicide Because Movie Stars Are Not Easy to Become: Graduates of a Film School Run by Chen Dabei, Sought to Be Actors but Had No Way to Obtain Introduction Fees, One of the Two Unfortunately Died Tragically</h3>
<p>Shen Xingji, a local, 20 years old, residing at No. 158 Shejiang Road, Zhabei; Xue Tong, 18 years old, from Nanjing. Shen and Xue were very close friends as they both studied in the capital, and both were fond of movies. Every holiday, they would go out together and spend time in various movie theaters in the capital, and over time it became an addiction. They even had the idea of trying their hand and hoping to appear on the screen, but they had no way to enter the industry and it was never realized. Recently, Shen and Xue heard that a film company in Shanghai was recruiting new actors, so they left school and came to Shanghai, staying in room No. 424 on the fourth floor of the Great China Hotel at No. 200 Xizang Road. They went out to visit friends every day, asking people to introduce them from all sides. Last month, Shen and the others somehow met Chen Dabei, who used to play young male roles in the New World Theater, and learned that Chen ran a film school. Therefore, they immediately went to enroll and paid tuition. Chen also promised that after graduation, he would introduce them to the Lianhua Film Company to work as actors. Recently, Shen and the others graduated, so they asked Chen to arrange for them. At that time, Chen also agreed, but after a day or two, Chen said that if they wanted to be introduced as actors, they would have to pay an introduction fee of 50 yuan before it could be done. However, Shen and Xue were unable to pay, so they did not pay. Afterwards, there was no news. Shen and Xue became very anxious. The night before last, Shen and the others still went out to visit, and then returned to their residence, closed the door, and went to bed. Unexpectedly, until 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the two had not gotten up. The hotel waiter became suspicious and knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time, so he found a way to open the door and enter. He saw Shen and Xue lying on the bed with pale faces. Empty bottles of sedative water were placed on the table. He realized they had taken poison and immediately telegraphed the Laoza Gate Police Station, which sent officer No. 164 to investigate. They used a car to rush Shen and Xue to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Shen Xingji had taken too much poison and died on the way before he could be treated. The hospital reported to the police station, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination by the court this morning. Fortunately, Xue had taken less poison, so after being treated by Renji Hospital, he regained some consciousness. When asked about the reason for his suicide attempt, it was as described above. The hospital immediately reported to the police station for investigation and discovered that Shen Xingji had left three letters, stating that his actions could serve as a warning to a class of young people. At the same time, he was from a prominent family and could not bear to disclose his real name and involve his family's reputation, and there was no need to grieve for him. Currently, these three letters are being kept by the police station, and they are still investigating his exact origin and surname.</p>
<h3>Cause of Apprentice's Death Clear After Autopsy: Zhao Zhimin First Suffered from Malaria, Then Suffered from Heart and Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhimin, a young man from Shaoxing, 18 years old, was introduced by Wang Helin (who works at the Hexing Silk Weaving Factory on Mamalang Road) in July of last year and recommended to the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 170 Laozifu Road in the French Concession as an apprentice to learn silk weaving. For over a year, he was honest and deeply respected by his companions and workers. He usually lived in the factory, and only went out for sightseeing during holidays. The day before yesterday was another factory holiday, but Zhao did not go out. At noon, he suddenly felt unwell all over, with a slight stomach pain, and went to bed. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 PM, he died. The workers discovered this and informed the accounting office, which reported to the French police. Unable to determine the cause of death, they collected the body and took it to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office. His family was still in their hometown, so the factory sent a telegram urging them to come to Shanghai to handle the aftermath. Yesterday morning, the police reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to visit the office with a forensic doctor and clerk to examine the body. It was found that the deceased's fingernails were purple and there were red spots on his skin, suggesting poisoning. However, the true cause of death could not be determined. The official then took a seat and questioned the manager of Meiya Factory, Lu Xizhang, the introducer Wang Helin, and the maternal uncle of the deceased, Zhu Huibiao. He instructed them to wait for the body to be dissected to clarify the cause of death. At 3:00 PM that day, Prosecutor Wang and forensic doctor Wei Ligong, with clerk Zhao Yifen, dissected the body and examined it in detail. The result was that the deceased had suffered from malaria and was currently suffering from heart and lung disease. He died from coughing and rupturing his trachea. After the examination, because the family had not yet arrived, the official instructed the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to transfer the body to the family for burial.</p>
<h3>Attempted Robbery of Tan Yankai's Residence: Wang Fudao and Ji Zhaozhao Each Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>The Chinese detective Su Changsheng from the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Zhang Fujin and Jin Wanrong, previously arrested three bandits, Wang Fudao, Ji Zhaolian, and Chen Xiaojin, from a thatched house on Jingzhou Road, Taoming Road, and Huasheng Road in Tongzhou. They seized an automatic pistol containing one bullet. Investigation revealed that they intended to rob the property of the late government official Tan Yankai's residence at No. 1050 Tangshan Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Liu Yugui, a judge, continued the hearing in the third criminal court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that no zero-cases had been found in the concession. However, Wang and Chen, the two defendants, had heard of a robbery case in the Hongqiao area of Zhabei. The police notified the Public Security Bureau in charge to investigate, but they claimed that the matter could not be ascertained. Today, the Public Security Bureau also did not send anyone to transfer the case, so there was probably no such thing. The police found out that Chen Xiaojin was not actually involved in the attempted robbery of the Tan residence on Tangshan Road and requested that he be released. Wang Fudao testified that the pistol was picked up in the Jiangwan area during the previous Shanghai war, and the rest of his testimony was evasive. Ji Zhaolian testified that Wang Fudao brought the pistol in the case and temporarily deposited it with him for a few days before taking it away. He did not go to the robbery of the Tangshan Road residence and was evasive. Judge Liu then sentenced Wang Fudao and Ji Zhaolian to six months' imprisonment each. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized was counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The gun and bullets were confiscated. Chen Xiaojin was allowed to be released.</p>
<h3>Sudden Cold Weather in This City</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather in this city has been very warm, with the Fahrenheit thermometer often reading in the sixties and seventies. Unexpectedly, in the past few days, the climate has suddenly turned cold, and the temperature has dropped below forty degrees. The north wind is howling, and pedestrians on the road are shivering, no different from winter weather.</p>
<h3>Murdering Cousin for Inheritance: Schoolboy Ding Fugen Tragically Murdered, Two Murderers Have Fully Admitted Without Denial, Clothes and Shoes Are All Stained with Blood</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 26th of last month, a nameless boy's body was found murdered in the cotton field near the Xuan Family Residence of the Longhua Cement Factory. Because no family could be found at the time, the police station in charge ordered the local bailiff to report to the Shanghai Local Court to send someone to examine and collect the body. Later, Ding Yin, a 49-year-old widow from Wuxi who ran a hardware store called Ding Juxing Sanji at No. 65 Kangnaot Road, Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai, submitted a request to the local court to claim the body. She claimed that the deceased was her own son, Ding Fugen, 13 years old, and was studying at the</p>
<h3>Franco-Chinese School</h3>
<p>She was boarding with her brother-in-law Zhang Genfa, who opened Zhang Yuxing Iron Shop at No. 123, Laohe Road, in the British Concession, because the road was far and inconvenient for traveling back and forth. He suddenly disappeared on the 25th of the same month. Now that she learned from the newspaper that the age and clothes matched her son who was murdered, she requested to retrieve the body and reported to the Public Security Bureau to arrest the murderer and seek justice. Detective Wang Shun from the Public Security Bureau discovered that Ding Fugen was killed by Wang Deyu, the son of Wang Awu, the younger brother of Ding Asan (the deceased's father) who had married into the Wang family, because he coveted the thousands of yuan of farmland that Ding Asan had left in his hometown. He usually held a grudge because he had not succeeded in borrowing money, so he colluded with accomplices to kill Fugen.</p>
<h3>Plotted to Seize the Inheritance</h3>
<p>It was also learned that one of the murderers, Jiang Chengren Zhou Ayuan, 26 years old, was a blacksmith and was hiding in the Wu Xinji Woodworking Shop at No. 107, Zhangjiabang, Jumen Road, outside the West Gate. On the 29th, they rushed to the scene and arrested Zhou, who confessed that he had helped Wang Deyu, who was on the run, kill Fugen, and that Wang was hiding in Nanxiang. The detective took Zhou by car to Nanxiang that afternoon and arrested Wang Deyu at the Xu Ji Inn, No. 3, Dakang Bridge, Dong Street. At this time, Wang had changed his name to Zhang Xugen to avoid attention.</p>
<h3>Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>He was sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. The French police learned that the location of the murder was in the Chinese territory, but the beginning of the case occurred in front of the Franco-Chinese School in the concession, so it should be handled by the concession court. A report was made to the Second Special District Court, and on the 2nd of this month, Jin Jiulin, the police chief of the Special Agency, ordered Zheng Shenmu Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin to lead deputy detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Shen Yuan Li Jinzhang to the Public Security Bureau to bring the two criminals Wang and Zhou back to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special District Local Court for</p>
<h3>Interrogation, Detention, and Investigation</h3>
<p>The case was heard. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the hearing in the first criminal court. First, the police lawyer Yuan Jiahan explained the case and the police investigation process and charged the defendants with premeditated murder under Article 284, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. He presented the clothes, shoes, and hats stained with blood that had been taken off the two defendants. Then, the plaintiff Ding Yin stated that her husband, Ding Asan, had died, and had only one son, Fugen, who was tragically murdered. She requested a thorough investigation and justice. Wang Yugong testified that he was 26 years old, from Wuxi, and a blacksmith. He used to run a shop, but now he was closing down. He and the deceased Ding Fugen were cousins. Because I borrowed money from my aunt, not only did she not lend it to me, but she also</p>
<h3>Insulted and Cursed Me</h3>
<p>Once when I went to eat, Fugen snatched my rice bowl and threw it on the ground, so I held a grudge. I invited Zhou Ayuan, a former colleague, to the Franco-Chinese School at noon on the 25th of last month, and lured Fugen to the Longhua Airport. At about 1:00 PM in the afternoon, I ordered Zhou to go home and get the murder weapons, a hammer and chisel. I held the hammer, and Zhou held the chisel. We pressed Fugen to the ground and killed him, and then threw away the murder weapons and fled. Zhou Ayuan initially denied helping with the murder, completely overturning his confession in the police station and Public Security Bureau. After the judge repeatedly questioned him, he admitted to helping Wang Deyu murder Ding Gonggen, which was the same as Wang's confession. At this point, the police lawyer stood up and requested that the</p>
<h3>Stains of Blood</h3>
<p>On the clothes and shoes presented be sent to a forensic doctor for testing to see if it was the blood of the victim. The two defendants also confessed that the blood on the clothes was not the blood of the deceased, but the blood that flowed out of our noses when the detectives of the Public Security Bureau broke them, which stained the clothes and shoes. At this point in the interrogation, it was already past noon. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the morning of December 1st. The defendants were still detained separately.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Sent a Letter to the Charity Federation Requesting Early Preparation for the Winter Relief Center</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, chairman of the Shanghai Charity Association, and Huang Hanzhi, vice chairman, said that in recent years, disasters have been frequent, all industries have been depressed, and the rural economy has reached the point of bankruptcy. The number of poor people and unemployed workers has increased compared to before. Seeing the situation, it is unbearable. The weather is getting colder now, and people are suffering from hunger and cold, and they cannot maintain their lives. We need to plan for relief as soon as possible and plan to open the Winter Relief Center, which has been organized in the past, in advance. Therefore, yesterday we personally appointed Zhang Zixin, the head of the general affairs team, to find and expand the address in advance so as to design and plan so as to avoid the difficulty of crowding in the future. The following is a letter from the Social Affairs Bureau to the association: "Dear Sir, The Winter Relief Center for Civilians in this city has been organized and managed by your association in the past, and the results have been remarkable. This year, rural areas in various provinces have gone bankrupt, and industry and commerce have stagnated, resulting in a large number of unemployed people and an increasing number of poor people, making it difficult for them to obtain food and clothing. It is especially necessary to handle the case in accordance with the case. Now that winter is approaching, we hereby send a letter for your reference and review of the past cases and prepare early, which is very much hoped."</p>

The two railway bureaus specially dispatched railway police to protect the North Station.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Engineering Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Engineering Society held its first standing committee meeting of this session at the Banking Association Club at 7:00 PM on November 16th. More than 50 people attended. After dinner, Chairman Xu Peihuang reported the results of this session's election. Xu Peihuang was elected as chairman, Wang Shengshen as vice chairman, Shi Konghuai as secretary, and Feng Baoling as accountant. At the next standing committee meeting, it is planned to invite the member engineer in charge of the construction of the capital ferry or the member Ling Fuming, an engineer of the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, to give a lecture. As for the business policy of this year, it was decided after discussion to proceed in three directions: academic lectures, soliciting the works of members' research experience, and social service. All members of the New Year's Eve celebration preparatory committee were decided to be selected by the branch staff, and then Mr. Bai Ge was invited to lecture on textile engineering. The newly arrived British textile professor of Jiaotong University from the United Kingdom, Bai Ge, was originally scheduled to attend, but he had a cold, so his son represented him. Finally, Mr. Shidelou, a wool manufacturing machine expert who had just arrived in the Far East from the United Kingdom, was invited to speak. Mr. Shi is 66 years old and has been engaged in the industry all his life. He is very experienced. After a short period of observation, he felt that China's wool industry was lagging behind and should use the experience of various countries to work hard and move forward. Finally, he urged all members to unite and cooperate. The words were very important. The meeting was adjourned at more than 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Sanbei Changjiang Round Qingpu Ran Aground in Digang, Decision to Send Barges to Unload Passengers and Cargo</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has been receding very quickly in recent days, making navigation on the river more difficult. The Sanbei Company's regular Yangtze River ship, Qingpu, which was sailing from Han to Shanghai, was carrying a large number of passengers and cargo. On the 15th, the ship arrived at the Digang River section downstream of Anqing. Due to the sharp drop in the river water, the captain was not careful when sailing, causing the ship to run aground in a shallow beach. Although the shipowners tried their best to drive the ship backwards, it was too deeply stranded and could not escape.</p>
<p>Fuyang Rescue Failed: The company's upstream river ship Fuyang is currently being rented by the military camp for transportation. After Qingpu ran aground, Fuyang happened to pass Digang, and Qingpu shipowner sent a signal for help. Fuyang immediately went forward to tow the ship. However, Qingpu was too heavy and stuck in the shallow beach. After towing for two hours, it still could not be rescued. It was important to carry out the transportation mission, so it could not stay any longer and left.</p>
<p>Two Ships Towing Ineffectively: After Fuyang left, the company's upstream river ship Songpu and the downstream ship Xinningxing both received the telegraph from the Shanghai Bureau ordering them to tow and rescue Qingpu. The two ships tried to tow again, but because Qingpu was deeply embedded, it could not be pulled out immediately and could not escape. Yesterday afternoon, it telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau for instructions.</p>
<p>Dispatching Tugs and Barges to Unload: After receiving the report, the Shanghai Bureau decided to dispatch several tugs and barges from Shanghai. It was decided to first unload the passengers and cargo from each cabin of Qingpu in order to reduce the weight of the ship and make it float on the river. Then it would be easier to tow and rescue the ship. After the Shanghai Bureau decided on this method, it had designated a barge and prepared workers to go to Digang to transport Qingpu's passengers and cargo to Shanghai, and then tow and rescue Qingpu. As for the damage to Qingpu ship body, it is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Wang Yongfu Accused of Illegally Selling Enemy Goods and Issuing Bad Checks; Plaintiff is Japanese National Hiraki Kinoshita, Sentenced to a Fine of 150 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wang Yongfu of Ningbo (also known as Wang Yongtang) established the Yonghua Company at No. 35 Renji Road in May of this year, operating a general merchandise business and also selling enemy goods. In September, Wang successively ordered several hundred bags of white sugar from Japanese merchant Hiraki Kinoshita of Kinoshita Trading Company at No. 1594 Hanbi Road, for a price of 4,176 yuan. Wang paid 1,500 yuan in cash and issued four checks from the Tongqing Qianzhuang on Ningbo Road, totaling 3,097 yuan. Combining these two amounts, Wang had overpaid the Japanese merchant by 421 yuan. When Kinoshita Hiraki presented the checks to the Tongqing Qianzhuang for cashing, the account lacked sufficient funds, making it impossible to collect the money. He went to Yonghua to negotiate, but Wang had already abandoned the shop and fled, disappearing without a trace. Realizing he had been deceived, he immediately reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation. Several days ago, Kinoshita Hiraki received two anonymous letters reporting Wang's whereabouts. He then, together with Chinese and Japanese detectives, went to No. 19 Taihua Lane, Tiantong Road, and arrested Wang Yongfu. He was taken to the police station and, yesterday morning, escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, stood up and stated the case, saying that the defendant was being prosecuted under Article 363 of the Criminal Law for fraud and Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law for issuing bad checks. He requested an investigation. Japanese national Hiraki Kinoshita, the victim, also complained about the defendant's issuance of bad checks to defraud him of goods. When questioned, Wang Yongfu confessed that he had been doing business with the Japanese merchant for two months. He had issued four checks for the white sugar he ordered from the plaintiff, but because the plaintiff had previously borrowed 2,500 yuan in cash and had not repaid it, he was unable to make the payments on time and had no intention of defrauding him. He also retained a lawyer to defend him in court. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the confession and ordered Wang Yongfu to pay a fine of 150 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be sentenced to imprisonment, with three yuan equivalent to one day. The remaining charges were dismissed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office Regarding Inappropriate Issuance of Brokerage Licenses to Tobacco Shops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office, requesting that it correct the Shanghai brokerage tax office's coercion of tobacco shops to obtain brokerage licenses. The original telegram is excerpted below: (Omissions) "We have received a letter from the Shanghai Tobacco Trade Association stating that their Shanghai South Office reported that the Wantailong Tobacco Shop at Wangjia Wharf reported that they have been selling small amounts of tobacco for many years and have never acted as brokers or collected commissions. They have never donated or obtained brokerage licenses. However, on the 20th of last month, they received a notice from the Shanghai Brokerage Tax Collection Office, ordering them to pay taxes and obtain a license within three days. They were extremely surprised. The brokerage tax notice lists certificates that belonged to the brokerage departments of the former Qing Dynasty. Now they are called registration certificates, with varying terms. Those who set up shops to act as brokers, buying and selling goods on behalf of customers and collecting commissions, are called brokerage households and should apply for certificates according to regulations. Our shop only sells in small quantities at wholesale prices, selling at the marked price and not charging customers commissions. We have ledgers to prove this and there is no need to obtain a license. The tax office's actions are clearly due to an error in the tax office's investigation. We are reporting this to you for clarification and submitting the notice for cancellation." As time was pressing, our office sent a letter on the 23rd, in addition to submitting a notice for cancellation, and also sent Mi Chuxin and Zhang Songji to meet with Qu Puyi (ie Yiqi), the director of the office, to inquire about the detailed rules for brokerage taxes. However, the director's response was irrelevant and unreasonable. Because they could not reason with him, the officials requested a written reply, which was promised but has not yet been received. Now, the shop has sent a letter urging our office to certify that it does not have the characteristics of a brokerage and cannot be required to obtain a license as an exception, in order to protect itself and avoid disputes. Upon review, this shop has been operating a tobacco business for decades. It sells tobacco in bulk and does not act as a broker or collect commissions. It does not need to obtain a brokerage tax license. We are sending this special letter to inform you of the situation and respectfully request that your office consider the difficulties faced by businesses, quickly investigate the matter, order the tax office to cancel the brokerage tax, stabilize the business environment, and avoid disputes." Upon investigation, the tobacco shops in this city that sell cigarettes all purchase them in bulk from manufacturers. Although there are some smaller shops that sell to them in bulk, the difference in price compared to retail is slight. The nature of buying and selling goods is the same. There is no commission charged and no buying or selling on behalf of customers. The position of a broker is between the supplier and the demander, buying and selling on behalf of customers, brokering deals, and specializing in collecting commissions. This is completely different from other industries that own goods. It is not appropriate to make a forced comparison. This matter is of great importance to various industries and it is difficult to create a precedent. Therefore, we are sending this telegram to respectfully request that your office maintain the status quo, quickly stop the tax office's illegal demands, stabilize the business environment, and avoid disputes. Sealed by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Descendants of Ying Baoshi Request Official Protection of Ancestral Temple Property</h3>
<p>The case of the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School (formerly Longmen Academy) on Shangwen Road auctioning off the Xianmian Gongliang Ancestral Hall has been reported in various newspapers after the Municipal Farmers' Association repeatedly requested party and government organs to stop it and the Municipal Land Bureau announced the investigation of the property rights of the ancestral hall. It is now learned that Ying Dewu, a descendant of Ying Gong Maishi, has also submitted a request to the government, asking for the protection of his ancestors' ancestral property. At the same time, he also sent a letter to Shanghai Middle School, asking it to stop the auction and wait for the government to take back management. His original submission stated: "Submitting a request regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School auctioning off the ancestral temple of a virtuous man, requesting a prompt stop to preserve public property and commemorate the past. My deceased father, who was granted the title of academician of the cabinet during the Qing Dynasty, served as the acting provincial treasurer of Jiangsu, the chief surveillance commissioner of Jiangsu, and the Daotai of Susongtai. The Ying Gong Zhengzhai Ancestral Temple is located on Shangwen Road, near the Huang Daopo Temple, which is west of the Xianmian Temple. It was built with private donations and completed in the 17th year of the Guangxu reign, listed as a local sacrificial典祀. It was located in the邑业. In the first year of the Republic of China, my late elder brother, Dehong, believed that the Shanghai Longmen Academy (later renamed school, now Jiang Su Provincial Shanghai Middle School) was founded by Minzhai Gong and the ancestral temple happened to be near the academy. In order to preserve it permanently, he presented it to the former Jiangsu Governor Cheng, ordering the former Shanghai Civil Administrator Wu to order the school to manage the ancestral temple nearby. This ancestral temple is public property, but it was entrusted to the school for safekeeping. This is very clear. Unexpectedly, this time, Shanghai Middle School published an advertisement auctioning off the school site on Shangwen Road, and even sold the ancestral temple's land. It has taken possession of it through safekeeping. This is shocking. I believe that my father's political achievements are glorious and lasting. During the Qing Dynasty, he suppressed internal rebellions and defended against foreign insults. His contributions were great. Even now, the elders of the three Wu states still praise him. Moreover, he established schools and promoted education, benefiting the scholars. It is only right to praise his virtues and repay his merits. Now, the ancestral property has been taken over by the school and is being sold off. This is to preserve the ancestral property, but it is being destroyed by the custodian. How could my late elder brother have anticipated this? The petitioner cannot bear to see the ancestral temple disappear without a trace. Therefore, I am submitting a detailed account of the situation, earnestly requesting a prompt stop to the private auction of the site of the ancestral temple of the virtuous Ying Gong by Shanghai Middle School and designating a local legal entity or educational institution to be responsible for safekeeping, in order to preserve public property and commemorate the past. I am waiting for your order."</p>
<h3>Butterfly Trademark Dispute Judgement: The Huainan Trademark is Revoked</h3>
<p>The trademark dispute between the Family Industrial Cooperative and the Huainan Chemical Industrial Cooperative over the Butterfly trademark has been litigated for many years and has long been a subject of public attention. Now, we have received Instruction No. 12000 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, ruling that the Huainan trademark be revoked. The judgement is excerpted below: The question of whether a trademark is counterfeited or similar should be determined by whether its main text or graphics are likely to cause confusion. The main point of contention in this case between the two parties is not whether the patterns are identical or similar, but whether the names are likely to cause confusion. According to the Family Industrial Cooperative's Invincible Brand trademark, which was approved for registration in the Republic of China in the 13th year, the trademark pattern included the word "Butterfly" as the main element and roses and other elements as secondary elements. Therefore, it was named "Invincible" Brand. When used in English, it was marked as "Butlerfly." Furthermore, according to the cooperative's application for registration of the three characters "Invincible Brand" as a trademark in the 14th and 15th years of the Republic of China, the Trademark Office repeatedly ordered that the two characters "Invincible" have the meaning of praising the function of the goods and cannot be used as a trademark alone. The "Invincible Brand" trademark previously submitted cannot be considered the main part of the trademark. However, the "Butterfly" pattern attached to the pattern and the pronunciation of the two characters "Invincible" and "Butterfly" are similar. Therefore, the trademark was approved for registration and designated for exclusive use on toothpaste products in Category 5 of Article 36 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trademark Law and was published in the newspaper. Furthermore, according to the cooperative's application to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for tax payment for the face-washing toothpaste produced in the 7th year of the Republic of China, the special brand name column also stated "Invincible Brand," commonly known as "Butterfly Brand," because the trademark pattern is in the shape of a butterfly, taking the harmonic meaning of the two characters "Invincible." Therefore, it is commonly known as "Butterfly Brand." It is undoubtedly the case that the "Invincible" and "Butterfly" of the Family Industrial Cooperative are the same trademark or a joint trademark. Moreover, the "Butterfly" part is more important than the two characters "Invincible." This is even more obvious. Furthermore, according to the documents sent by the Unified Affairs Department to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in the 11th, 11th, 14th, 15th, 15th, and 16th years of the Republic of China, the trademark column all stated "Invincible Brand," that is, the word "Butterfly." This shows that the cooperative not only considers "Invincible" and "Butterfly" to be the same trademark or a joint trademark, but also has actually used the two characters "Butterfly" for more than ten years. Therefore, the general public knows that "Invincible" is "Butterfly Brand." The main part of the trademark of Ms. Hudie's portrait is naturally the two characters "Butterfly." Furthermore, according to the advertisements and defense statements submitted by her, she also admitted that it is the "Butterfly" trademark. Furthermore, only the two characters "Butterfly" are prominently signed on the trademark pattern, which further indicates that the trademark name is actually "Butterfly." Although the trademark patterns of the two parties, one is a portrait of Ms. Butterfly and the other is a butterfly pattern, are indeed different, the two characters "Butterfly" in their names can be said to be completely identical. Furthermore, according to the application of the appellant for registration of the two characters "Hudie" in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Trademark Office rejected the application. In June of the same year, she changed it to a transformed "Portrait of Ms. Hudie" trademark, which further exposed the intention of the appellant to imitate the other. The focus of the dispute between the two parties is whether "Hudie" is a homophone of "Invincible." Based on the facts listed above, it has been proven that "Invincible Brand" is "Butterfly Brand," which can be considered the same trademark or a joint trademark. Therefore, whether it is a homophone or not is not important to this case and can be set aside for the time being. Based on the above judgement, the trademark names of the two parties in the market transaction are inevitably likely to cause confusion. The objection and resale determination made by the Trademark Office are not inappropriate. Therefore, according to law, it is decided as the main text, that the appeal of Huainan is rejected.</p>

<h3>National General Assembly of the Independent Church of Jesus Christ News: Welcoming Chairman Zhang's Assembly on the 19th</h3>
<p>The China Independent Church of Jesus Christ, founded in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign by the elder Yu Guozhen of the Presbyterian Church, now has more than 20,000 members, more than 300 branch churches, and is spread across 20 provinces and overseas Chinese locations in Southeast Asia. It is truly an authentic church that is completely self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. However, due to the lack of centralized talent and the increasing economic difficulties, there have been no significant achievements, which is a pity. The founders of the association, Xie Yongqin, and others, in view of this, specifically proposed a plan for fundamental transformation and thorough rectification at this National Congress of Representatives, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. All proposals, numbering more than 60, have been passed and are being carried out in order. Thirty-three representatives from various branches of the country, Guo Wenlan, Chen Jinfu, Wen Bingmin, Fan Ren, and others, were elected to the Executive Committee, and Zhang Zhijiang, Xie Yongqin, He Xuecheng, Lin Meichuan, Shao Changgeng, Song Zefu, and Chen Pinjie were elected as standing committee members, with Zhang Zhijiang, the governor, serving as chairman. In order to be responsible for church affairs separately, a Ministry of Church Affairs and a Ministry of General Affairs were specially established. Pastor Lin Hongbin was appointed as the Minister of Church Affairs, Pastor Chai Lianfu was appointed as the Minister of General Affairs, Wang Hong was appointed as the General Secretary, Zhu Baoluo was appointed as the Economic Committee Member, and Xie Yongqin and others were appointed as members of the Property Management Committee. It is believed that the development of church affairs of the association today can be predicted. It is now learned that the association has scheduled a welcome assembly for Chairman Zhang at the Yongzhi Church on Xiangyin Road at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th of this month, and will convene the first Standing Committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Prince Joins National Products Sales Company; Sponsors and Initiators Reach Fifteen Provinces</h3>
<p>Since the preparatory office of the China National Products Sales United Company successively published the first and second announcements, not only important officials of the National Government and people from the financial and industrial circles in this city have joined, but also enthusiastic officials from all provinces of the country have taken the lead in responding. It is now learned that, taking the province as the scope, the number of sponsors has reached fifteen provinces and regions. Several days ago, Qinghai Prince Ya Qingzhai came to Shanghai to plan the development of Qinghai, bringing with him various plans. He sent staff to the preparatory office of the Sales Company to request the articles of association, plans, announcements, and various printed materials. He deeply believed that the company's planned steps coincided with his intention to develop Qinghai. He expressed his sympathy and has already sent a telegram with his signature to join the initiators. After the preparatory office receives the letter, the director of the preparatory office, Wu Zhihao, the chief secretary, Lin Wanlang, and the planner, Ren Jinpin, will visit Prince Ya in person to invite him to attend the sixth meeting of initiators held at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce this afternoon to report on the general situation of Qinghai's recent industries and the established development plan. Prince Ya is a student who studied in Japan and once served as a Tibetan professor in Japan. After returning to China, he deeply understood the terrible nature of the Japanese conspiracy to invade and the urgency of the British and Russian threats. He created the theory of the joint self-strengthening of the five ethnic groups and promoted it to the heads of various leagues and banners in Qinghai. More than 20 of the 29 banners under the jurisdiction of Qinghai expressed their deep sympathy with Prince Ya. The reason why the Qinghai Mongols have not been swept into the vortex in this situation of Mongolian autonomy is due to Prince Ya's efforts to promote the country.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Implements Second Plan Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai National Products Company opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road in this city implemented the expansion plan, it has stipulated a standard number for the monthly total turnover and set the goal of completing the plan in six months with the monthly total turnover reaching twice the standard number.

<h3>Woman Finally Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Wang Qiyuan's Rescue is Incomplete; Why Did Her Sister Scold Her?</h3>
<p>The woman Zhou Wu, 28 years old, was from Yangzhou. Her husband, Zhou Deguang, had been working in Tianjin for several months. She lived at No. 64 Senderi, Maigen Road. Her family was extremely poor, and her husband had not sent back living expenses for a long time, which made her economic situation even more difficult. On the 15th of this month, she missed him and resented him. She had thoughts of ending her life. Just as she was about to swallow opium to end her life, Wang Qiyuan, a partner in a barber shop at No. 32 Kader Road, went to her place to wash clothes for her. Seeing this situation, Wang could not bear to stand idly by and immediately dissuaded her and sent her to her sister Chen Wu's place at No. 110 Gansidong Road in the French Concession. He thought that after her sister's persuasion, she would be able to give up her suicidal thoughts. Unexpectedly, when she arrived, her sister saw an unfamiliar man accompanying her and suspected that she was up to no good. Not only did she not comfort her with kind words, but she scolded her and slapped her forehead. As a result, she immediately returned home and felt even more upset than before. She swallowed the opium again. Later, a woman who lived with her caught a glimpse of her and sent her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It was ineffective and she soon died. The hospital reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered investigator Liu Xuecheng to investigate. He carried the body to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Lian, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, came to the morgue to examine the body. According to her brother Wu Chunrong, who lived in Pudong and worked on the Taikoo ship, the deceased was his sister. This time, she suddenly committed suicide because she was raped by someone surnamed Wang. According to Wang Qiyuan, a barber, he denied having an affair with the deceased and confessed the previous events. Mr. Guo then ordered that the deceased Zhou Wu was a woman who died of opium poisoning. The corpse was handed over to her brother Wu Chunrong, who signed a bond and took it back for burial.</p>

<h3>Teachers Retain President Xu Songming of Peiping University Despite Resignation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has previously instructed that President Xu Songming of Peiping University be retained despite his resignation. Recently, Wu Xiangfeng, Dean of the Medical College, and Liu Yunchou, Dean of the Agricultural College, came to Beijing. (Wu represented President Xu in explaining to the Ministry of Education that he still requested to resign, and Liu reported on the situation of the college.) When they arrived at the Ministry of Education, Minister Wang was out on official business and could not meet with them. The two deans originally planned to go to the Ministry of Education again on the 15th. However, on the 15th, Liu suddenly developed muscle and bone pain, and his waist could not move freely. (His diet was normal, and he had no fever. When the reporter visited him on the 16th, Liu was sitting quietly, unable to move his waist freely. If he tried to move his waist, he would feel pain in his muscles and bones. He said that this symptom had occurred once in the spring for the past three years, initially caused by his own overexertion when moving a box and getting injured.) So he sat quietly in the hotel and could not report the situation of the college to the Ministry of Education again. (Liu went to the Central Hospital for medical treatment at 3:00 PM on the 16th. His condition was not serious, but he could not move freely.) It is heard that Dean Wu Xiangfeng has now gone to the Ministry of Education to represent President Xu's resignation and to present the particularly difficult financial situation of the three colleges of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The Ministry of Education still retained Xu Songming despite his resignation and promised to provide relief within the possible range for the financial situation.</p>

<h3>Wuben Girls' Middle School Turmoil Comes to an End ▲ Principal Yan Returned to School Yesterday ▲ Classes Can Resume Next Monday</h3>
<p>Wuben Girls' Middle School, a municipal school in this city, has been established for more than twenty years, and the school's atmosphere is generally good. This time, after the change of principal, a turmoil suddenly arose due to a minor matter. Several days ago, the students insisted on their opinions, and the Education Bureau believed that students interfering in school administration should not be tolerated and was determined to rectify the situation, so the situation was extremely serious. In the past two days, after teachers sincerely persuaded the students in many ways and explained the importance of the matter, they changed their attitude of interfering in school administration and requested the Education Bureau to be lenient and not to suspend the school. The situation gradually eased. As of yesterday, according to the Shanghai News Agency, the students have all understood the importance of the matter and are focusing on their studies. The Education Bureau is also considering the sincerity of the teachers' request. If the students truly repent, they may not pursue the past. A great uproar can thus come to an end. Principal Yan and the director of academic affairs returned to school yesterday afternoon to handle affairs, and classes can resume next Monday (the 20th). The school will issue a formal notice to the students' parents at that time.</p>

The original principal, Zhou Zhenfu, has handed over full responsibility to Huang Zhilan, Le Yuanlong, and Fang Qian due to a lack of time to manage the school. They will continue to run the school and have hired Mao Bingxin, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Hong Kong, as the dean of academic affairs.

<h3>Negotiating to Borrow the Yiyuan as the Finish Line for This Year's International Race Walking Event ● The Racecourse Insults the Chinese ● The Competition is Extremely Absurd</h3>
<p>The racecourse authorities refused to lend the venue for the finish line of this year's international race walking event because the Chinese did not maintain order, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to a Western newspaper reporter's interview with the racecourse authorities, the refusal to lend the venue was entirely due to the Chinese not maintaining order and damaging equipment. All Chinese people who read this are shocked. The racecourse has nothing other than the grandstand, yet it is being said that equipment was damaged, which is extremely absurd. The racecourse has always welcomed the Chinese as its purpose in every horse race, which is why it has achieved its current scale and has been able to carry out large-scale construction over the years. This is known to everyone. Now, baseless accusations are being made to coerce and arbitrarily insult the Chinese. How can any patriotic person accept this? It is said that the International Race Walking Association is unwilling to take the blame and is no longer negotiating with the racecourse. Therefore, it is negotiating with Yiyuan to ensure that the race walking event is not hindered by this.</p>

<h3>Mr. Huang Mingdao's Funeral Today ▲National Sports Advancement Association Will Fly Half-Mast Flag in Mourning at 2 PM at Haig Road Chinese Funeral Home</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Mingdao, a director of the All China Athletic Federation and a member of the banking community, passed away due to illness on November 14th at 2 PM of the national calendar. The encoffining ceremony, following Christian rites, was held the day before yesterday (16th) at the Chinese Funeral Home at 670 Haig Road. The funeral is scheduled for 2 PM today (18th). Mr. Huang had a wide circle of friends, and it is expected that many from both the sports and banking sectors will attend the funeral. Mr. Huang devoted himself to promoting sports and provided significant support to the Athletic Federation. His efforts were instrumental in the success of the Eighth Far Eastern Games. Therefore, on the occasion of his funeral, the Athletic Federation will fly the flag at half-mast to express their sorrow. Dr. Kiyoshi Kishi, President of the Japan Athletic Association, passed away during the Meiji Jingu Games in October. The association paused the competition for one minute for silent mourning and covered his body with the Japan Athletic Association flag during the encoffining ceremony. Not long after Kiyoshi Kishi's death, Mr. Huang has also passed away. The successive deaths of these two enthusiastic promoters of sports are a great loss to the sports community and the Far Eastern Games.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Modern Chinese Educational Thought (4) ▲Lecture by Shu Xincheng ▲Notes by Sun Yucai</h3>
<p>(II) The Era of Military-National Revolutionary Education (1912-1919). After the establishment of the Republic of China, social thought underwent major changes, and educational thought naturally changed accordingly. This period truly bore the important mission of inheriting the past and opening up the future. New and old ideas were constantly in conflict, which is worth discussing. Now I will divide it into four aspects:</p>
<p>▲Military-National Educational Thought and Military Education Thought After the Republic of China, due to the dual reasons of the world trend and the imminent danger to the country, the thought of military-national education arose. The purpose was to make the entire nation subject to military training so that they could all take up arms to defend the country in times of emergency. After the educational purpose case promulgated in the first year of the Republic of China stipulated a military-national education item, society publicized it and schools implemented it one after another, reaching its peak for a time. By the eighth year of the Republic of China, it was no longer in vogue due to the impact of international pacifist thought. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, it gradually transformed into military education thought, which continued to flow constantly to the present. It has been more than 20 years since this thought was advocated, but why has it not had a significant impact? First, it is because of the laziness of the scholars; second, it is because of the hostility of the ruling authorities to this thought.</p>
<p>▲Practical Education Thought and Applied Education Thought Due to the emptiness and falseness of old Chinese education, the impracticality of new education, and the oppression of international capital imperialism, this kind of practical or utilitarian educational thought was produced in response to the times. By the sixth year of the Republic of China, it was transformed from utilitarian education to vocational education, and the thought of practicality was interrupted from then on. The most influential aspects were: first, textbooks gradually became closer to children's abilities and social needs; second, science teaching gradually focused on experimentation; third, it established the foundation for vocational education and scientific education. It is a pity that the group of people who advocated it at the time focused specifically on primary schools and did not pay attention to secondary education. Fortunately, it gradually expanded later, and now vocational education in China has spread from primary schools to universities.</p>
<p>▲Aesthetic Education Thought In the first year of the Republic of China, Cai Yuanpei took the lead in advocating aesthetic education. After Cai went to Germany to study philosophy, psychology, and aesthetics, he deeply felt the excellence of Germany's aesthetic education facilities. Moreover, due to his fundamental thought tending towards cosmopolitanism, he vigorously promoted aesthetic education, believing that only beauty can break the views of self and others and advance the world towards harmony. For more than ten years, Cai has been the only backbone figure in the thought of aesthetic education in China. At that time, due to the function of aesthetic education itself, political assistance, and the impact of contemporary thought, it was able to have some greater impact on educational practice in a continuous manner.</p>
<p>▲Great Harmony Education Thought The world today is certainly not yet in great harmony, and it is not yet certain whether it will be in great harmony in the future. However, the psychology of hoping for great harmony is shared by all. Why is this? The first reason is naturally that it arises from the public psychology of hoping to relieve suffering; the second is a reflection of international oppression; the third is a manifestation of the peaceful nature of the Chinese people. In the modern Chinese educational history, Kang Youwei was the first to advocate great harmony education. His personal educational ideals were (a) racial improvement, (b) infant and early childhood education, and (c) equality in education. Those who followed up to promote and develop it were people like Gao Yihan and Chang Naihui. However, this kind of great harmony thought, although its origin is due to the shared nature of the human heart, it is actually an ideal that is not easy to realize. Therefore, if we want to find the impact of this thought on practical education, it is more difficult than other kinds of thought. Kang Youwei's communist great harmony education, Gao Yihan's pan-life great harmony education, and Chang Naihui's artistic great harmony education are even more purely superhuman ideals that naturally will not have a day of realization in the real world. Therefore, it can be said that the true great harmony education thought has never had any influence in modern China. However, this trend of thought, due to the reflection of democratic governance, caused some romantic and free actions in the Chinese education community, which eventually declined due to the pressure of an unsuitable environment after a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Copycat</h3>
<p>— Virtuous Virtuous</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yan Qiao's "Copycat Books" published in this column, I was able to grab a good topic. There are things in the world that are more humorous than copying foreign textbooks.</p>
<p>After the European War, Germany was pointed at by everyone as a "war-mongering country". Before its defeat, it was majestic, and everyone admired the "iron" and "blood" of the Germanic nation. This "militarism" has been "copied" by countless countries. Among the various "copycat versions," the most authentic copy is our East Asian neighbor, an empire of the same script and race. However, "copying" is not easy, so our East Asian neighbor is working hard. Up to now, they have only copied the first half of the "German original." It is said that they are now preparing to copy the original version from 1914 onwards.</p>
<p>Bolshevism is naturally a famous original Russian work. Almost every country in the world has tried to copy this version, but collotype, photostatic copy, rubber plate, and all kinds of forms have failed. Therefore, apart from the "Russian original" being fully preserved, all other countries have are nothing more than fragments, broken steles and incomplete inscriptions, far from reaching the level of Luo Yang paper being expensive.</p>
<p>Italy also has a famous work, Fascism. According to the original author, Fascism is not allowed to be copied, but Germany already has a good "copycat version." It is said that copying "Fascism" is easier than copying Bolshevism, and the Fascist copycat version sells better than the Bolshevik copycat version. Therefore, everyone who failed to copy Bolshevism started copying Fascism. The best examples are Turkey and Germany.</p>
<h3>Landed in My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Bernie</p>
<p>In fact, I had no choice but to return to my hometown.</p>
<p>The stars were still struggling with the moon in the sky, and I was already sitting shivering in the streetcar, rolling towards the North Station! From the French Concession to the International Settlement, it was still so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. Apart from the police officers standing upright on the street all night, you couldn't find a single dog. It was really strange! I was really puzzled. When I approached the Chinese territory, not far from the station, no, when I was about to reach the place where the authority of imperialism could not reach, white dawn finally radiated from the sky. I was grateful! I was sent from the forces of darkness to the bright land of my own. I was really grateful to this hardworking driver! He actually had such great power, and I felt my own insignificance even more.</p>
<p>When the train stopped at S Prefecture, I followed a large crowd and squeezed out of the belly of the smoke-spewing monster, and got on the streetcar again. I sat like this, comfortably, with my head tilted back, and the scene here was still lying quietly like this: "Old ancient city! Long time no see! Is everything still well? Huh! What worries do you have? What complaints do you have? Ah! I already know: Is it because you are a feudal relic, and what lies in front of you is the enchanting white bridge, the capitalist cannon attacking you, causing your fate to have signs of instability? He might be proud in front of you, thus making you explode with anger? ..." The P Pagoda could no longer evoke my admiration. In the past, it seemed to be full of poetry and classical flavor, but now I feel even more disgusted.</p>
<p>Capitalism has entered the market of S Prefecture, and the banners of price reductions are whistling in the wind, "Little Baby, get up and eat a piece of cake" in the thunder and lightning Xia Li, "Speaking of Shen Guisheng..." "Thinking of a segment..." turned the entire Q Street upside down. Because this kind of noise was not enough for his desire, K Lane was widened by him! I was really afraid to see this giant demon who eats people all over the world.</p>
<p>People in S Prefecture are good at eating, and there are especially many shops that sell food, and they have never had a stomach ache (those who do have a stomach ache are exceptions). Eat! Eat! But no one has ever thought of eating the powerful neighbor who oppresses our race, so I began to be strange! I don't want to eat. I am a pauper and can't afford to eat at all. I don't even have any rice to eat! Go, go into the small city that I also hate. There is no place I don't hate, but I hate it, and the more I want to go in, this is my internal contradiction, and this contradiction is constantly growing: I myself am a little puzzled! Today, I remembered a sentence:</p>
<p>"If I don't go to hell, there will be more and more suffering people in hell!" Hey! Hey! What a shameless thing to say.</p>

<h3>Massage Parlor in the Photography Studio</h3>
<p>— Moman</p>
<p>Director Shen Xiling has always been known as a "monster" in the Star Company. Recently, after directing "The Cry of Women", he directed "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours" and has already made a strange drama once. That is, he wanted to direct a shot of a rat stealing food. The rat didn't listen. The "night object" director directed for a whole night, not only did he not shoot a foot of film, but even all five rats ran away. It seems that this incident has been published in various newspapers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was even stranger. In "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours", in order to expose the lewd life of the bourgeoisie, he inserted a scene of a massage parlor that was popular in Shanghai at the time.</p>
<p>It was in the studio of the Star Company, where a door scene of a massage parlor and a set of a massage room were set up. It is said that the strange director had personally visited several massage parlors on Xiafei Road to observe them, so it was completely realistic.</p>
<p>In addition to the necessary staff and workers in the photography studio, many of the strange director's friends and relatives came to visit this massage parlor that they had heard of but never seen.</p>
<p>The lights were set up, and the camera faded from "Meimei Massage Parlor" into the massage room. The fat man You Guangzhao did not hesitate to sacrifice his appearance, wearing only a bathrobe, lying straight on the white spring bed. The expression on his face had a touch of erotic mania, especially that jade leg, which was revealed from the bathrobe, was very sensual.</p>
<p>Then, the massage girl hired from the massage parlor appeared in the photography studio, dressed like a female nurse. It's just that there is always a bit of lust on her face. Female nurses are often like nuns.</p>
<p>Then, the strange director shouted strangely, and the camera made a creaking sound. The massage girl picked up a powder tube and sprinkled it on You Guangzhao's white and fat body. The fat man couldn't help but be fascinated. Then, the massage girl lightly stretched her jade wrist and pushed and pinched it. Even if you, fat You, are a modern Liu Xiahui, you can't help but be moved. At this critical moment, the monster also knew that something was wrong, and quickly shouted Cut, so this good show ended without any illness. Fat You stood up suddenly and sighed for a long time.</p>
<p>The audience in the movie studio laughed. The strange director's strange drama was successful.</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 18 They Comforted Her Husband with Tea and Parted With Her Family with a Smile</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that he had passed by here once, thinking that he would be returning from Daying to Haitien every day in the future. Now, he was still walking on this road, and the hypothetical illusion seemed like yesterday. But he was afraid that this was the last time he would walk this road. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but raise his head and look around. The green wheat seedlings had already stretched out their ears from the leaves, facing the wind, and just kept nodding to people. He felt that every time it nodded, it contained the meaning of reluctance to leave. The trees outside the village are now growing green. When the leaves of these trees have fallen off completely. But I don't know where I am? The roofs of Haitien can still be seen in the distance, and they are still uneven on the plain. Looking at them in the past, I didn't feel anything strange, but today, when these roofs come into my eyes, I feel that there is something particularly nostalgic about them. As he slowly approached Haitien, his heart began to beat faster. The sunlight shone golden on the ground. The people on Haitien Street were working happily there early in the morning. It seemed that the soldiers saw the blood-red sunlight in their eyes, while the citizens of Haitien saw it as golden yellow. Zhao Ziqiang thought to himself that the same sunlight, when seen in the eyes of two different people, has a different meaning. That's all. Yesterday, I went back and said that the team was going to pass through Haitien. I don't know if my father and Miss Yang are... His feelings were not finished yet, the team entered Haitien Street, and he saw a crowd of people gathered at the entrance of the alley of his house from a distance. Without asking who was in this group of people, his heart was already pounding. Sure enough, in this group of people, there were his father, his fiancee, his mother-in-law, and also that Ms. Huang Manying. Ms. Huang was a female student after all, and she couldn't bear to be very calm. She had already run dozens of steps to meet her. Tian Qing's row of people happened to be in front of Zhao Ziqiang. Huang Manying saw Tian Qing standing next to the team, and suddenly stopped, her hands wanted to stretch out. (243)</p>

<h3>Points to Note Regarding Audio Frequency Amplification</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In radios, the most common audio frequency amplification uses transformer amplification. It’s easier to amplify and the volume is rich, but distortion is inevitable. When using this type of amplification, the transformer ratio should not be too high; for vacuum tubes, if using AC power, use indirectly heated types; the C voltage must be very accurate; if the final output uses a power tube, the distortion caused by excessive grid excitation voltage can be avoided; the B voltage should not be too high; the power supply filtering also needs to be perfect; and most importantly, do not use inferior transformers.</p>
<p>If the transformer wiring is incorrect, it can easily cause AC hum and other strange noises. Switching the primary or secondary wiring often solves this.</p>
<p>The most distortion-free amplification method is resistance coupling. This is because the signal voltage passes through the capacitor C (Figure 1), and the plate current flows entirely through R. It doesn’t saturate the iron core like transformer amplification or cause distortion due to poor construction or uneven amplification rates for different frequencies. Since the plate current flows through R, the B voltage should be increased appropriately to compensate for the voltage drop across R. Usually, the voltage should not be less than the specified maximum value; even increasing it by one-third compared to the original is common and harmless to the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>This amplification method can be used for three or more stages. If a pentode output tube is used, one stage is sufficient. For the value of C, the first stage can range from 0.1 to 1/2 microfarad, and for the final stage, 0.004 to 0.01 microfarad is good. Do not use values that are too large, as this can easily generate a “motorboating” sound. For R, 1 megaohm (i.e., 0.1MΩ) is commonly used for any tube. For R1, the first stage can use values below 2 megaohms, and the final stage can be as small as 0.1 megaohm.</p>
<p>Between the above two methods is a third type: choke coupling amplification. The sound quality and volume are very good. It can also significantly reduce AC hum, so many amateur builders use this method. The circuit is the same as in Figure 1, but a low-frequency choke coil is installed in place of R. Alternatively, a good coil from a transformer with a broken winding can be used. AC current cannot pass through the choke coil, so C is the only path for the audio frequency current. In both of these methods, the insulation and voltage rating of C should be noted.</p>
<p>For large volume, pentodes are of course the best. However, pay attention to the input signal voltage. If it is too small, it will not excite the tube; if it is too large, it will cause distortion. The impedance matching of the speaker also needs to be appropriate. If the B and C voltages are not accurate, their effectiveness will not be apparent.</p>
<p>To eliminate the need for a filtering device in the speaker, the plate current of the output tube should not exceed 10 milliamperes, otherwise there is a risk of burning out the speaker coil (of course, not for dynamic speakers). Output tubes such as the -38 pentode and the I2A triode are very suitable. I hope my comrades who want to use domestically produced speakers pay attention.</p>
<p>If a domestically produced speaker is used to output a larger plate current, Figure 2 shows a good filtering device. The value of C is 1 microfarad or more.</p>
<p>I have now discussed some common points. Finally, if comrades who build their own radios find that the AC hum is too loud, please switch to the latter two methods. At the same time, pay attention to the detector stage, as it has a significant impact on AC hum. If the power supply uses a triode rectifier such as the I2A, the AC hum is much less than with the 71A. The rectifier tube should be far away from the detector tube, or shielded. Double-screen rectification is the most satisfactory. Also, using a 0.001 to 0.1 microfarad capacitor connected between the plate and filament of the rectifier tube or across the high-voltage winding of the power transformer is very effective in reducing AC hum.</p>
<h3>How to Build a Tungar Bulb Charger (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Use No. 17 double-silk-covered wire to wind it on the wire frame, each week closely together, do not horizontally disorderly staggered, in order to prevent power consumption, after winding a layer, use waxed paper or silk wrapped on it (the wire must not be cut off) then wind the second layer, and so on, winding to five hundred and fifty weeks, use a soft wire soldered in the middle, and lead out this wire, write a sign, so that the wiring will not be confused (the original No. 17 double-covered wire does not need to be cut off) directly wound to one thousand and one hundred weeks, cut the wire, use the wire to tie the coil on the winding tightly, this coil inputs the current, directly inserted into the light live wire, called the positive circle, there is current output, called the auxiliary circle, after the positive circle is wound, it is the auxiliary circle, the auxiliary circle is wound with No. 16 double roots and wound in parallel, each wound to five weeks, there is a lead, which is one volt, because the formula of the transformer is:</p>
<p>Positive and negative voltage: auxiliary circle voltage = positive circle number: auxiliary circle number</p>
<p>220: X = IIOO: 5</p>
<p>∴X = 220 × 5 / IIOO = I Volt</p>
<p>When winding to twenty weeks, there are four volts, and when winding to thirty weeks, there are six volts, then cut the wire, and the lead is crowned with words such as I23456, so that it can be recognized.</p>
<p>After the transformer is made, the resistor must be made, and the resistor is easy to make by itself. The No. 22 German silver wire (commonly known as stove wire) is wound on the porcelain tube, and each porcelain tube can be wound for fifteen feet. Thirty feet can be wound on two roots (when winding, pay attention to the fact that each week must have a gap and must not touch each other) Within an appropriate distance, use soft flower wire to tie tightly on the German silver wire, lead out the lead, and also crown it with words such as one two three four five six seven eight, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>After the parts are made, they are connected together to form a Tungar bulb charger, and the connection method is shown in Figure 3. V is a Tungar bulb, L is a carbon filament bulb, T is a transformer, R is a resistor A is an ammeter P is a plug A+ A- is the two poles for charging A electricity. B+ B- is the two poles for charging B electricity.</p>
<p>When charging, first turn the filament voltage of the linear bulb to two volts, and turn the resistance to the maximum value. If charging A electricity, connect A ten on the charger to the positive pole of the battery, and A- to the negative pole: If charging B electricity, then connect B+ and B- two poles (Note: the cathode and anode must not be confused when charging, otherwise the battery will be damaged after reverse charging) Then insert the plug into the electric light wire, if you see that the Tungar bulb filament is slightly red, then the voltage is still insufficient, you can turn the adjustment rod to three volts or four volts; then turn the resistance adjustment rod to an appropriate resistance, and stop when the ammeter has an indication of the number of amperes passing through (Note: the current must not exceed two amperes when charging A electricity: when charging B electricity, the current must not exceed one hundred milliamps, otherwise the filament will be easily burnt and the life will be shortened)</p>
<p>This charger can charge A electricity from two volts to twelve volts and B electricity from fifty volts to ninety-six volts, and if you make one yourself according to the above method, it will be enough to charge yourself or others. (End)</p>
<h3>The Past and Future of Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>In the earliest days, diode vacuum tubes were only used for detection, replacing the function of crystal detectors. Later, because the effect obtained after detection alone was very weak, triode vacuum tubes were invented, which served the dual purpose of detection and amplification. However, at that time, detection vacuum tubes could also be used for amplification, with no significant difference. Although there were differences in amplification between high and low modulation, their function remained the same, with only slight variations in the setup. This was the state of vacuum tubes in the DC era.</p>
<p>Because DC radios were too wasteful in terms of economics, they gradually underwent reforms, transitioning from DC to AC. The current period is the AC era. The vacuum tubes used in the AC era are far less simple than those in the DC era. Not only can the filaments of various vacuum tubes use alternating current, but also due to the progress of radio science. Each type of vacuum tube is given a specific task. As a result, the types of vacuum tubes have become numerous and are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>From a manufacturing engineering perspective, vacuum tubes are also being improved every day. Older vacuum tubes were mostly made in tubular shapes similar to ordinary light bulbs. The filaments were prone to vibration, which greatly affected the lifespan of the vacuum tube. The current popular style has a smaller upper end, with a non-conductive material inside to fix the positions of the filament, grid, etc.</p>
<p>The smaller the shape of the vacuum tube, the more convenient it is. Although the internals of current vacuum tubes are becoming more complex, the shape is shrinking every day. There is hope that future vacuum tubes will be made the size of a pen, and some radio enthusiasts even hope to make a radio with the volume of a wristwatch, which is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes have filaments, and their lifespan is inevitably limited. I heard that filamentless vacuum tubes have recently been manufactured, which should have a longer lifespan. As for other strange discoveries in the future, they cannot be predicted today.</p>
<h3>The Process of Manufacturing Fixed Resistors</h3>
<p>— Keming</p>
<p>Fixed resistors are made by carefully packing a pre-measured resistor material into a moldable clay material, then placing it all in a strong fire to bake dry.</p>
<p>This clay material is ground into an extremely fine powder, carefully mixed with other materials to obtain various properties such as strength, durability, and moisture resistance. Then, it is mixed with an appropriate amount of water to form a fluid liquid. After prolonged mixing, it is subjected to 150 pounds or more of pressure in a specially made filter press to remove excess water. The result is a smooth, pliable clay that can be baked into a product with greater heat resistance than any single rock powder.</p>
<p>The resistor material is a mineral with stable electrical properties that is not easily affected by strong heat. It is carefully ground and mixed into a slurry.</p>
<p>These two slurries or mixtures are placed in a hydraulic press. The pressure cylinder of this machine is shaped like a long tube, 8 inches in diameter, with a smaller tube inside. The outer tube is filled with the clay slurry sent from a mill. The mill has previously re-mixed this material and removed any air gaps hidden inside. The resistor material is pressed into the smaller tube, after first passing through a specially made machine to remove all air and create a vacuum, because any air inside would cause the material to bubble, resulting in inconsistencies. Afterwards, great pressure is applied, and the double-layered mold at the head of the cylinder opens, and the two slurries are extruded like noodles, with the resistor material completely encased in the clay material.</p>
<p>Skilled technicians cut this soft strip into uniform lengths and carefully place them on shallow trays, which are conveyed by a conveyor belt to a long stove, slowly evaporating the moisture so that the strips can be held in the hand without deforming. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Casual Chat After Listening (5)</h3>
<p>— Weiyan</p>
<p>| The Current State of the Domestic Broadcasting Industry |</p>
<p>In addition to these, there are many radio stations with excellent broadcasting programs, but there are also many that are messing around. Now, let me give a few examples below:</p>
<p>Chatting Up</p>
<p>One night, after it was already past one o'clock, I suddenly heard an old man making a sound like breaking bamboo, saying: "Mr. Wang on ×× Road, have you heard? Is the sound crisp? There's one spot open for mahjong here, are you interested in coming?" Then I heard him say: "Mr. Zhao on ×× Road, there's a very good mung bean soup here, would you like to taste it?" This gentleman, after smoking enough opium late at night, still thinks of using the radio to invite guests, which is truly absurd!</p>
<p>Cursing People</p>
<p>A certain professor hired by a certain radio station was absent for many days due to various matters. The station then openly cursed him, disregarding his reputation and issuing him a serious warning. Using the radio to curse people is truly fanciful. In addition, disputes caused by competing for programs, sending each other telegrams and waves, and mutually denouncing each other are even more common.</p>
<p>Special Programs</p>
<p>Some small-scale radio stations do not have the money to invite outside groups to perform programs. Unable to do otherwise, they spend a few small dollars to call up a few street singers to broadcast a few ditties or a few off-beat Beijing operas on stage, considering them "special" programs. These things, when exposed, are truly jaw-droppingly ridiculous!</p>
<p>Modern</p>
<p>Recently, most of the records broadcast by various radio stations are modern songs, such as "Loving the slender beauty, saving the plump charm", "When I look at you, my soul floats in the sky, the fire of love burns like a flame, my whole body melts". These phrases are really too "modern"! Even the once-popular "Lullaby", full of "uh" and "ah" sounds, is enough to erode the vigor of the Chinese people after listening to it too much.</p>
<p>Crying to Heaven and Earth</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned modern songs, there are also comedic records. Originally, it is acceptable to impart solemnity through humor. However, the comedy popular in Shanghai is truly outrageous. What "crying to heaven and earth", "crying for Grandpa Miao Gen", and in the past few days, you could hear "crying for Wang Wu Neng" every day. There are also "little monks chanting sutras", "old Taoists releasing flames"... and so on, all of which are their excellent material. In our opinion, we only feel vulgar and disgusting, and we do not feel any laughter or joy.</p>
<p>In China, commercialized broadcasting stations account for almost eight or nine out of ten. Their only income comes from a few stores entrusting them to broadcast programs on their behalf. Stores are willing to spend money to broadcast programs to promote their business, so they cannot help but choose programs that meet the needs of the masses based on the psychology of the listeners. Therefore, I believe that to improve broadcasting programs, the first thing to do is to improve the level of national education.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Marconi Talks About Ultra-Short Waves After Marconi has been researching on yachts for a long time, he claims that he has made significant progress in ultra-short crossings. He said that he can now make radio waves converge into a very narrow beam, so that the receiving end can only be within the focal point of the concentrated easterly radiation. He also said that voice transmission is clearer than ordinary telephones. The problem that is currently hindering ultra-short waves and needs to be solved is how to make radio waves penetrate hills, buildings, and other obstacles. — Ming</p>
<p>Berlin Tests Ultra-Short Wave Broadcasting After a year of experience, it is now known that using ultra-short waves (the wavelength of the test is seven meters) emitted from the top of a tower, its reliable communication range is the distance within the radius formed by twice the distance from the tower top transmitter to the ground, with the transmitter as the center. It has also been tested that ultra-short waves still have some slight curvature on the ground. The shorter this unnecessary wavelength is, the smaller it is. If it is seven meters, it can still increase the radius.</p>
<p>A radius of 40 kilometers can reach any major city, so it is now very possible to use local ultra-short wave broadcasting machines to replace long-wave radio stations. — Ming</p>
<p>New Radio Stations at Home and Abroad The new radio station in Kootwijk, the Netherlands, has a wavelength of 18.75 meters and a power of 50 kW. The station calls itself "Synsck, Kolo di Qu". A new radio station in Czechoslovakia is called "Slovaki", with a power of 30 kW during the day and 15 kW at night. A 20 kW radio station will soon be established in Cairo, Egypt. The new radio station in Lisbon started operating on October 25 with a wavelength of 290 meters and a power of 20 kW. The new Marconi radio and telephone machine installed at the Shanghai Zhenru International Radio Station can be installed and completed this year.</p>

<h3>US Dollar Closing Sharp Contraction Premium Recovered Eleven and a Half Yuan ▲ General News Confused Market Extremely Blurred ▲</h3>
<p>The gold market was relatively stable yesterday, with a strong opening, a slight decline after entering, and then a stable market trend. In the early morning, the overseas silver market contracted in England and rose in the United States. The five gold exchanges saw the price of silver for delivery in future months rise by 3.8% to 5.5%. Exchange rates opened higher but closed lower, stocks rose by 4 yuan and 6.5 jiao, US cotton rose by 14 points, US wheat rose by 1.875 points, London raw gold contracted by 6 and a half pence, the US government's gold purchase price did not move, the wool opening price was 945 yuan, and people's hearts were relatively stable, and the situation was also good. After the opening, the domestic market tightened. A private telegram stated that when the US dollar fell to 5 yuan and 5 jiao on that day, England and France intervened to control it, and the closing price rose sharply. A Reuters telegram also stated that the Federal Reserve Bank would buy British pounds and purchase US dollars. People's hearts were even more encouraged. In addition, it was predicted that HSBC would list the British dollar at par and the US dollar would contract by 3.125, so it broke through the 700 yuan mark. Subsequently, due to various rumors (HSBC's listing was misreported twice), there were several rapid ups and downs around 700 yuan, and the market was extremely vague. After entering, the foreign exchange market loosened, and suppliers became eager. Western businessman La Lai also sold US dollars. The central government supplied US dollars, but it was unsustainable, and it gradually went downstream. There was also a private telegram that US senators supported the president's policy. The latter market went from flat to stable, with banks and companies making purchases, showing a mediocre performance without any special changes. Finally, Jewish businessman Qiao Zhizhi bought US dollars and Xiang Meng also had purchase orders. The price was tired but recovered strongly, with the cash price at 1,104 yuan and the swap spread at 6 yuan. The day's market situation will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 695 yuan, a recovery of 7 yuan and 7 jiao compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 5 yuan and 2 jiao. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 4.375 points. US exchange at 34 yuan and 0.625 jiao. Tongxing Yongheng Yu Shunli Qianchang Shen Hengtai Hengxing Shangyi Bingxing Yidayong and others scrambled to buy, rising to 702 yuan and 8 jiao, because it was predicted that HSBC would list the British dollar at par and the US dollar would contract by 3.125. Goods Zhengchang Han Shen Heng all sold, and the shape went downstream. Fuyu Zhifeng Yongdaxing Yong sold to 698 yuan and 3 jiao, and Zhaofeng Chang Yuanheng Yuan Zang Yongfu Chang Jin went to 701 yuan, falsely reporting that HSBC listed the British dollar at an increase of 0.625 and the US exchange was flat. Zhifeng Yong sold on the market, and people were shocked, lacking buyers, and a cloud then retreated to 696 yuan. At this time, it was extremely vague, and Bingxing also sold, and there was a lack of proper transactions in the market, so the ups and downs were quite fast. Until Hengtai Hengyu entered the market, the US dollar for March was settled at 875, and HSBC officially announced the listing, with the British dollar at par and the US dollar contracting by 3.125, rising to 701 yuan. Shanghai blocked the US dollar for March at 75, and Fuyu Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng Shunli Qianchang Xiang and others sold, and dropped to 696 yuan and a half. Zhengjin bought the US dollar for March at 8125, and Futai Heng Zhengchang and others entered at 9 yuan and 3 jiao. After entering, the foreign exchange market was very strong, and Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Huixiang and others sold, falling to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. Hua Bi Lai also bought the US dollar for March at 875. After that, the situation hovered, but due to Hengxing Yuan Mao Yong and others supplying, the trend became hovering. Zhengjin bought the US dollar for March at 9375, and rose to 5 yuan and 8 jiao twice. Hua Bi blocked December at 25, Datong offered January at half a yuan, and it was difficult to sell March at 9375. Hengyu Zhengjin Daxing Yong and others sold one after another, and fell to 691 yuan. Zhengjin bought the US dollar for March at 35 yuan, Hengyu Dalian helped to pay, and then recovered to 5 yuan. Hengchang Yong Bingxing sold and retreated to 3 yuan and 1 jiao. After struggling, the afternoon closing was 694 yuan and 4 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 3 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon was 694 yuan and 2 jiao, and the opening price of goods was 4 yuan. People's hearts were quite stable and gradually improved. Bingxing Daxing Yong Fuyu Hengyu Yuan Mao Yong Yuan Zang all entered the market. Pan Gen bought the US dollar for February at 625, and gradually rose from 3 yuan and a half to 9 yuan. Bingxing Hongli sold, Shanghai blocked the US dollar for December at 125, and retreated to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. However, because Qianchang Xiang Zhaofeng Chang Daxing Yong Dadecheng and others still entered, North Korea paid the US dollar for March at 8125, and rose to 9 yuan and 2 jiao again. HSBC blocked the US dollar for February at 5625 twice. Tong Taichang sold and was frustrated, Hua Bi competed for the US dollar for March at 8125, and Hongli Hengchang Yong Shunli all sold. Then there were no buyers for March at 8125, and it fell to 4 yuan and 3 jiao. After entering, Yuan Mao sold, but because Dafayong and others entered, Zhengjin bought the US dollar for March at 875, and gradually improved. Later, because Citibank bought the US dollar for January at 375, Qiao Zhizhi strongly bought the US dollar for December at 125, and then it was difficult to settle. Xiang Meng bought some, and Qianchang Xiang Yidayong Dadecheng Yuan Feng Yong paid, and rose to 9 yuan again. The closing price was 698 yuan and 8 jiao, and the goods were discounted at 8 yuan. Yuan Mao sold, and later retreated to about 7 yuan. The highest price of the day was 702 yuan and 8 jiao, and the lowest was 691 yuan, with a fluctuation of 11 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, it recovered 11 yuan and a half compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was reduced by 3.125 because HSBC Bank's US exchange was listed at 33 yuan and 4.375 jiao, and the combined premium price was 717 yuan. According to the closing price, the discount was about 18 yuan, which was 5 yuan less than the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 708 yuan, December was 700 yuan, and January was 694 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 708 yuan, and the supplementary water in the afternoon was 712 yuan. The cash price was 1,104 yuan. In the morning market, the Tianjin Gang sold more than 5,000 taels to Yingfeng Heng Tongfeng Yong Taikang Run Dadecheng and others, with prices ranging from 1,103 yuan to 08 yuan, and the transaction was most active between 045 yuan. The Tianjin Gang in the city came to buy, and Yingfeng Heng sold 300 taels to it, at 1,108 yuan and a half. Finally, there was a lack of supply at 10 yuan. The swap was posted by Ruixing to Yuan Zang Yong 28, which was Yuan Yuan. This month's notes still have 1,225 notes left, and December has 5,313 notes.</p>
<p>The transactions in the market were complicated. In summary, Wanxing Yuan Xing Yong Bingxing Tongfeng Heng Dafayong Yuan Mao Yuanchun Hengtai Chang Sheng Yong Xiang Hezhibang Yuan Xing Yong Bingxing Tongfeng Heng Dafayong Yuan Mao Yuanchun Hengtai Chang Sheng Yong Xiang Hezhi Yong Ruixing and others were on the selling side, while Zhaofeng Chang Fuyu Yuankang Xiang Qianchang Xiang Senchang Yongyidayong Tongyi and others were on the buying side. Hengchang Yong Daxing Yong and others first sold and then bought, and Bingxing Yuanheng Yuan Mao Yong and others entered and then exited. Dalian Bang Yuanli did a total of more than 4,500 notes, and settled more than 200 notes. Wanxing did a total of about 3,600 notes, and settled more than 1,100 notes. Guangbang Hengxing entered more than 300, and exited more than 200. The chips for January totaled 26,887.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Small Coins Reduced, Copper Coins Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of small Jiangnan coins fell by $1 in the morning session, amounting to $127. In the afternoon session, it rebounded by $1.50, amounting to $828.50. Transactions amounted to 8,000 corners in the morning session and 6,500 corners in the afternoon session. Guangdong small coins were priced at $785.80 in the morning session, down by $1 from the previous day's morning session. In the afternoon session, it continued to decrease by 9 corners, amounting to $784.90. As a result, the total decrease between the two sessions was $1.90, with transactions amounting to 60,000 corners in the morning session and 35,000 corners in the afternoon session. Copper coins increased by 500 cash, amounting to 305,500 cash, with transactions amounting to over 37,270 strings, equivalent to $12,200.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Are Stormy 丨 Due to Numerous Accounts, Only One Trading Session Is Held in the Afternoon ▲ Political Turmoil Is Rapidly Changing, and Speculators Are Exhausted ▲</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite turbulent. Rumors were rampant in the market, and there was no consensus. News of the Fujian Incident was changing rapidly, and speculators were exhausted, ultimately suffering self-inflicted wounds. At the opening in the morning, it was reported that the Fujian situation had eased, but because its internal affairs were complex and inconsistent, it might not become a reality. Various factions rushed to cover their short positions, and buying in the market, particularly for stocks #43 and #53, was very enthusiastic. On average, market prices mostly rose by four or five corners, and in some cases by seven or eight corners. This rebound was expected by the reporter. The situation changed abruptly in the second session, and a huge wave suddenly arose. Rumors spread that Chen Jitang had arrived in Fujian. Spooked by groundless information, many long position holders panicked and rushed to sell, and large investors took the opportunity to absorb as much as possible. Buying of stock #4 was especially strong. In a single shift, the holdings of retail investors were transferred to the hands of large investors, and market prices fell by several corners to more than one yuan. Most bond prices reached new lows, and the atmosphere in the market was extremely negative. Trading was also very active, resulting in numerous accounts. The opening of the afternoon session was delayed until 4:30 PM. It was temporarily proposed that only one trading session be held in the afternoon. At the initial opening, retail investors continued to rush to sell, with "Weaving Heritage Small" down by 7.5 corners and "Disarmament Small" down by 9 corners. The situation was very discouraging, but stock #4 and most large investors mostly increased their buying while reducing their selling. Afterward, starting from stock #19, the news in the evening papers turned positive, with rumors being proven false. Buying of stock #4 became even more aggressive, and market prices gradually stabilized and then rose. Thus, the various prices listed below improved by three or four corners. The market prices in the same session were so contradictory, demonstrating that speculators were profiting, while retail investors had been frightened out of their long positions. Long positions were concentrated in the hands of large investors, so in the future, retail investors will surely fail. Although market prices may still fluctuate, victory will ultimately belong to the large investors. As a result, market prices mostly continued to fall by three or four corners to six or seven corners, except for stock #18, which fell by $1.10, which was the most senseless. The price of all short-term June salt tax bonds rose by 4.5 corners, and the prices of distant salt tax bonds also slightly improved by 0.5 corners to three or four corners. The chaotic trend was entirely due to the panic of retail investors. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over $20 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>New-Fung foreign firm reports, on the 16th, the New York stock market rose sharply by about $5, the surge being the strongest within the month. Because the US dollar fell again, Wall Street predicted that before Roosevelt went to Warm Springs, the White House would make statements favorable to long positions. The US dollar later rebounded, but it did not hinder the rise in the stock market. Trading was quite brisk throughout the day, with a total of 2.58 million shares traded. "Wheat" saw significant buying during the dip. Due to the sharp rise in the stock market, sentiment was positive, and given the weakness of the US dollar, the market seemed likely to continue higher. The official "Cotton" gold price remained unchanged for three days. It was widely rumored in the market that the US dollar would stabilize and rise. Southern producers continued to hedge sell, and December futures were also being settled. The market's response to fluctuations in the US dollar was insensitive. Spot demand was weak, but prices were firm. Furthermore, yesterday's announced broker loans totaled $741,000,000, a decrease of $32,000,000 from the previous week. The 60-day interest rate was 0.75%, and the 90-day rate was 1%. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Rehabilitation Society remained unchanged at $33.56 per tael. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Stalled in a Deadlock</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak again, and the situation remains dull. The daily fluctuation range is within five corners. In this situation, the market sees less development, and speculators generally lack interest. As a result, the market is in a desolate state, and trading is shrinking daily. Spot yarn business is increasingly quiet, and the future situation lacks certainty.</p>
<h3>Human Cotton Weak</h3>
<p>The human cotton market opened weakly in the morning session, with American cotton rising, but the gold market flat. Most months opened with short positions, each month down by one corner. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn demand was quite quiet, each month down by 1.25 corners. The total transaction volume for the day was 4,600 bales. Sales included 250 bales of Tai Xing, 500 bales of Heng Yi, 550 bales of Geng Feng, 350 bales of Chang Feng, and 550 bales of Xin Cheng. Purchases included 250 bales of Chun Ji, 250 bales of Zhen Da, 600 bales of Shen Ji, 600 bales of Yuan Tai, 300 bales of Tong He, and 300 bales of De Ji. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 233,800</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics for the day show that various groups bought a total of 577 bales. Prices are flat and weak, with little fluctuation. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 30 Inland 232 Nanjing 5 Changsha 150</p>
<p>Sichuan 100 Ningbo 30 Haizhou 10 Peers 20</p>
<p>The cotton market remains in a state of persistent deadlock, with no discernible fluctuations. However, the environment is unfavorable. Although American cotton has risen, the gold market is still weak, and sentiment remains flat. Spot cotton sales in the market are very light. Japanese merchants also have a bearish outlook. However, prices in various producing areas remain firm, and the supply is not strong. Therefore, there is a lack of new sellers, and the market remains stable without significant ups or downs.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The Zheng cotton market opened flat and weak in the morning session. Selling pressure was extremely dispersed in the market, with each month down by 5 points. In the afternoon, there was some short covering, with each month up by 5 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,800. Sales included 1,000 dan of Yu Kang, 1,100 dan of Da Ji, 2,000 dan of Chang Ji, 1,200 dan of Chang Yu, and 800 dan of Yi Yu. Purchases included 1,000 dan of Heng Yi, 2,400 dan of Yuan Da, 600 dan of Tai Xing, 600 dan of Heng Chang, 500 dan of Chang He, and 500 dan of Yuan Xing Chang. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 786,800</p>
<h3>Factory Demand Lackluster</h3>
<p>Spot cotton business is quite sluggish. Factories see limited outlets for yarn sales and are also affected by the weakness of overseas cotton markets. They have no interest in raw materials. The supply includes 1,434 bales of Yao cotton and 4,541 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton is completely stagnant and has not been traded.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Is Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>丨 Also Artificial Silk Is Shipped to Japan 丨</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of anti-Japanese goods in England and Japan, raw materials for Japanese textile industry have been greatly affected. Fortunately, this year's Chinese cotton has a good harvest, so those who originally adopted Indian cotton are now changing to purchase from our country. It is heard that in recent months, Chinese cotton shipped to Japan is about 2,000 tons or more, mainly Zhejiang cotton. Now it is machin cotton of the Yangtze River. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, there were another 300 tons exported. It is also heard that artificial silk is also being shipped from Shanghai to Japan. Each Japanese ship exports 30 to 50 tons, totaling more than 700 to 800 tons in the past two months. It is not known whether this artificial silk is produced in our country or comes from overseas.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls First, Then Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market showed no certainty and fell due to long position closures. Later, it rebounded strongly due to buying by industry players and Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 11 to 15 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 13 points, and futures prices fell by 19 to 20 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 16 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long position closures and selling by European exporters. As a result, Pingal fell by 2 rupees and 7.5 corners, Orham fell by 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 corners. The original telegraphic records are on the left (16th telegraph).</p>

<h3>Japanese Yarn Factories Actively Expanding in China</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the base for Japanese textile industry. Recently, due to the movement of resisting Japanese goods in our country, the Japanese sales declined, but the sales of Japanese yarn are trending prosperous again. At the same time, in view of the advancement of the policy of resisting Japanese yarn in India and Vietnam, they are even more actively expanding their ambitions to invade China. Each factory has successively increased its capital to seek expansion of business. The original capital of Japanese-owned yarn factories was 11 million yuan. Recently, it has increased its capital by 5 million gold yuan. Shanghai Textile Company has also increased 3 million yuan. A few days ago, Tongxing, Huafeng, and other five factories sent an inspection team to various places in North China and Northeast China to investigate everything, and plan to build large-scale cotton spinning factories in Qingdao and other places. Shanghai Textile Company has decided to allocate additional capital of 2.7 million to build three large yarn factories in order to increase production and dump them into our country.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Market Turns Flat After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, the market in each month presented an initial rise and then a flat picture. The price of foreign wheat reported that Chicago rebounded by six or seven corners, and Canada rose by two or three corners. Therefore, although the market atmosphere was good after the opening, this month was as good as two or nine corners. The distant months were also slightly better by one point. However, after the second session, since the actual sales group had no movement, the long positions had returned, causing the sentiment to turn flat, and transactions had also decreased. Until the opening in the afternoon, the near and far phases were roughly hovering. The factory also continued to borrow a boat of wheat from the government, priced at 4.2 yuan, but the market did not issue any files, so the market remained stable. As a result, November and December each fell slightly by 2.5%, January fell slightly by 5%, February fell slightly by 7.5%, March rose by 2.5%, and April fell slightly by 2.5%, it is said.</p>
<h3>Buyers Are Excited, and Wheat Prices Rise ▲ Foreign Wheat Prices Are Good 丨 Flour Sales Are Not Strong ▲</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for future wheat saw a stable and bullish trend in each month after the opening in the morning and afternoon. The foreign wheat price reported that Chicago was better by six or seven corners, and Canada was better by two or three corners. This situation seemed to increase the excitement of buyers. However, in reality, although domestic inventories have not dried up, the arrival of goods at the ordering stalls has not been abundant, and flour sales are not strong. People in the industry are unanimously bullish. This kind of supply and demand seems to be beneficial to long positions, so from the opening to the closing, the recent sentiment is very firm. According to industry speculation, it may be necessary to see the two-corner mark. As a result, November and December each rose by 5 points, January rose by 4 points, and February and March rose by 2 points. In the spot wheat market, factory stomachs are diligent, inventory is limited, and high-priced bids are higher, 5 points better than the previous day. Kai-Tong wheat is 4.07 yuan, Huangqiao wheat is 4.07 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat is 4 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat is 4.05 yuan. 2,000 packages went from Fuxin and 4,600 packages went from Xiangxin.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Arrives, Prices Soften by Two Corners</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The supply suddenly increased, with a total of more than 80 companies arriving, with about 10,000+ shih of goods. Among them, late rice from various gangs accounted for nearly 60 companies, about 8,000+ shih, so the late rice market situation inevitably softened. However, there are also many outlets for the package stomachs, with a total of more than 5,000 packages (6,000-7,000 shih) going to the North and South Oceans gangs. Therefore, the market situation seems to contain a turnaround amidst the softness. As for the stores on this street, the general trend is similar to yesterday, but because the supply has increased, the sentiment is inevitably affected, so the market situation has also declined accordingly. Statistics show that the price of late rice in the city has been reduced by more than two corners. The prices of Changbang, Su Tong, and Nangang have fallen by about a corner. Du Yangjian lacks goods and stands still. Yinbianyuan has not changed much.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 47-48 companies arrived with goods from various routes, but the market sales are still sluggish. The market prices of new glutinous rice, thin rice, Yangshe Township Xian rice are slightly down by a few points. The prices of early rice, Baiyuan and Kexian rice are stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Chaoqing Will Soon Appear ▲ Costs Are Higher...Limited Quantity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was still sluggish due to the frequent drops in prices, so the trend continued to be weak. The Association's quoted price for 24 coarse sugar and white ordinary goods was down by 1 corner, at 20.2 yuan. The quoted price for high-quality 8-9 Dutch red sugar was 16 yuan, and the quoted price for B-mark ancient sugar was 20.55 yuan, down by 5 points, with no transactions. China No. 1 cotton white was slightly sold at the original price of 19 yuan, and the rest were returned. The quoted price for Zhenji's own factory's Bingren brand was 23.2 yuan, and the quoted price for the Qianzi brand was 23 yuan. The quoted price for Chao Gang's Chongti Zhuang was 15.6 yuan, and the quoted price for Huang Gang Qing was 15.4 yuan. According to local telegraphic information, the first batch of new Chaoqing goods has already been packaged for dozens of packages and will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. However, the cost is about 16 yuan, and the quality and color may not be as good as old goods, so the existing old goods in stock will not be affected.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Rumors of Kerosene Price Increase Are False</h3>
<p>Last month, this newspaper learned that Mobil, Asiatic, Texas, and other major kerosene companies in Shanghai were competing fiercely, so the oil market was likely to decline. However, recently it has been rumored in the local area that the price of kerosene of various brands may turn to rise. It is said that the price of Mobil kerosene of various brands will increase by one yuan per box after November 15, and the other companies will increase by half a yuan per box. After inquiring from reliable sources, it has been learned that this kind of rumor is fabricated by speculators in order to gradually clear out the long positions purchased in March of this year at a higher price during this economically tight period. According to the purchase price of kerosene, there will be no price increase in the near future. At present, the old Mobil brand new hall is still sold at 5.4 yuan per pair, and the Eagle brand new hall is 5.2 yuan per pair. The wholesale prices of new hall oil from other companies vary, roughly from 5.4 yuan to 5.7 yuan per pair.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hardware Has Signs of Contraction 丨 Overseas Pricing Has Been Reported to Rise 丨</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, and the Northern gangs are gradually returning to their hometowns. If Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai all have those who are starting to return north, and the local industry is also not good in the market, and they are all planning to end in advance, so the whole city looks very desolate. There are very few goods opened. The price of each goods has not changed because there is not much buying and selling. However, overseas pricing has been reported to rise in recent days. The following is what we know</p>
<p>200-pound S &amp; C Iron, 3 gold yuan and 7.2 cents per pound</p>
<p>90-pound American tinplate, 4 gold yuan and 1 cent per box</p>
<p>100-pound Also, 4 gold yuan and 3 cents per box</p>
<p>90-pound British tinplate, 10 shillings per box</p>
<p>100-pound Also, 18 shillings per box</p>
<p>112-pound S &amp; C Iron, 16 yuan per ton</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>True and False</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Mr. L said in his article "How to Write": "I remember when I was young, I liked to watch magic tricks. Monkeys riding sheep, stones turning into doves, and finally, a child being stabbed to death... Everyone knew that the child did not die... But they still watched with fascination, clearly aware that it was a clever trick, and yet completely immersed in the magic. If a magician insisted on making it real, buying a small coffin, putting the child in it, and carrying it away crying, it would be boring. At that time, even the reality of the magic would disappear."</p>
<p>Therefore, his conclusion is: "The general disillusionment and sorrow, I think, lies not in the falsehood, but in taking the false for the true."</p>
<p>I would now like to add: "The general satisfaction and joy lies not in complete truth or complete falsehood, but in something that is seemingly true and false."</p>
<p>How is this to be seen?</p>
<p>I remember when watching plays in the countryside, I loved to watch battles with real knives and guns. The battles on stage were originally fake, but using real knives and guns made them seem much more satisfying to the audience. Also, if the young male actor playing a fallen nobleman wore a gold ring, the audience would spit and curse. However, as long as a piece of white paper was wrapped around the ring, the problem would disappear. The audience would accept him as a person worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Truly bloody and flesh-flying warfare is terrifying, truly disheveled and dirty beggars are disgusting, and completely false things inevitably feel empty. People with fragile hearts who cannot fully empty their minds can only seek a simulation of truth from false things for satisfaction. Romantic artistic works are produced in this way and loved by people. Therefore, Tolstoy called them "beautiful lies" and said, "Truth is terrible... People understand truth according to the degree of their desire to know it, explain the truth... However, this is never done in the form of art."</p>
<p>The reality of today's world is extremely terrifying, making people afraid to look directly at it, and forcing them to turn to plays and things like plays. Therefore, beautiful lies are even more popular.</p>
<p>Moreover, one must use truth to deal with truth, and falsehood to deal with falsehood. For example, in one play, an actor playing a loyal servant who has fallen into a foreign land kneels on the stage and sings as he begs. The audience then throws copper coins to him, indicating that he is generous and righteous. The more copper coins there are, the longer the actor's singing lasts. This is very similar to the recent phenomenon of anti-Japanese heroes engaging in humble professions and benevolent and righteous people expressing sympathy.</p>
<p>The benevolent person who throws a handful of copper coins to the actor may not be willing to give a penny to a real beggar encountered on the road. The righteous person who expresses great sympathy for a fallen hero may not generously open their purse when donating to support the Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>It is easy to deal with falsehood with falsehood, but difficult to deal with truth with truth.</p>
<h3>Mr. Seiji's Goat</h3>
<p>— Jofu</p>
<p>This is a short story by Sato Haruo. Among Mr. Sato's works, besides "Okinu and Her Brothers," this is my favorite.</p>
<p>In terms of thought and technique, this one cannot be considered his representative work. "Okinu and Her Brothers" is stronger in every aspect compared to this one. However, I appreciate this story with a completely different sentiment. Perhaps it is because I am middle-aged now?</p>
<p>The story narrates the life of a thirty-eight-year-old man who is divorced and living alone. However, he is not lonely; he is constantly surrounded by a group of young people. He loves to mingle with them, almost forgetting his own age. "A man is young before forty, and strong for the next fifteen years," the protagonist optimistically believes. Therefore, he doesn't want to appear old in his appearance. He dresses even more stylishly and fashionably than the young people. He says, "According to foreign customs, the older one gets, the more fashionable one should dress." But, eventually, that day comes: "Look! Oh! How disgusting that man looks!" A young girl no longer likes the Philosopher's line on his face. Then, the young people around him leave, and he turns to "learning a foreign language he had never learned before. He finally chose French as his lover." Although this protagonist had another unintentional love affair afterward, he grew old. After spending three years, "What he learned was linguistics, the truth of not being able to love."</p>
<p>What a beautiful story, full of implications and depth! This is truly a Japanese-style work, difficult for the Chinese to understand. A person over forty in China is already considered old. Although he can still take concubines, visit prostitutes, and engage in extramarital affairs, love affairs are rare. It's not just the Philosopher's line on his face that women dislike, but also the decline of one's own vitality and the "gaze of outsiders," which are forbidden by civilized customs. Therefore, our society is full of thirty-year-old old men. Their faces show dignity, and their actions naturally differ from those of young people. "A man is still young before forty" must be discounted in China. So China is an ancient country, nearing its twilight.</p>
<p>"Look! Oh! How disgusting that young old man looks!" I wish to hear Chinese youth also utter such words of disdain.</p>
<h3>Late Autumn</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Autumn is deep.</p>
<p>Yellow leaves fall from the trees. The west wind blows against the face, cold and piercing, attacking everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Every year, when this deep autumn season arrives, my heart unexpectedly feels lonely. Since the death of my only beloved daughter last year, this loneliness has been accompanied by a deeper wound: as soon as I am touched by the west wind, my scar relapses, aching intensely.</p>
<p>I am afraid of autumn! I am especially afraid of this kind of deep autumn!</p>
<p>When my heart begins to ache, my wife is my only source of comfort. Only by placing my heart in her warm embrace can I forget everything.</p>
<p>Although my wife also has her own sorrowful emotions, just like me. Perhaps the wound in her heart is even deeper than mine, because I often see her secretly bowing her head and shedding tears behind my back.</p>
<p>But besides her, I have nowhere else to seek my comfort.</p>
<p>We live by comforting each other.</p>
<p>A few days ago, my wife told me that she wanted to go back to her parents' home to stay for a while. When I first heard this, I felt a chill all over my body, and my whole heart seemed to fall into an ice cellar. For a long time, I couldn't open my mouth.</p>
<p>"If she leaves, where can I entrust my heart?" I thought painfully. But I couldn't dissuade her because her character is very stubborn. I only hoped that she would automatically dismiss this idea.</p>
<p>However, the reality could not be avoided after all. This afternoon, when I came home from the office, my wife was gone.</p>
<p>The house seemed even more empty, and the surrounding walls seemed to be pressing down on me.</p>
<p>I sat down on the chair in a daze, picked up a pen, and wanted to write something to dispel the loneliness in my heart. However, my brain nerves were a little strange. After contemplating for a long time, I hadn't written a single word on the paper. Instead, the shadow of my deceased beloved daughter kept coming and going before my eyes. My heart started to ache again.</p>
<p>How empty the surroundings are! The air pressure outside the window is also particularly low, pressing tightly on my heart, making me unable to stay on the chair for even a moment. Finally, I stood up resolutely and locked the door.</p>
<p>I wandered aimlessly on the streets. The streets were lively: cars moved like long snakes, people crowded and walked like ants, the radio in the shops broadcasted loudly, the phonograph at the chestnut stall raised its voice to sing operas, the newspaper vendors reported the current situation, and the beggars recited their sutras behind me. Everything was making lively movements.</p>
<p>But my heart felt even more lonely!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a young couple walked past me from the opposite side. The two people's bodies were pressed closely together, and their faces were filled with youthful joy. The woman's flowing beautiful eyes and alluring smile made me think of my wife. When she walked close to me, she cast a cold glance at me, seemingly laughing at my loneliness.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but suddenly stop in my tracks.</p>
<p>The cold west wind blew against my body, and my heart throbbed with pain again. I decided to go see my wife.</p>
<h3>Stimulation in Literature</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>A gentleman wanted to write "Casual Talks," and he started by picking on me. He said, "The reason why Mr. Zhou Zuoren aroused Mr. Tang's dissatisfaction may be because Mr. Zhou is unwilling to tell lies." The purpose of this sentence is to accuse me of also needing to tell lies. But he deliberately bent the knife point a little, saying that my dissatisfaction was because of Mr. Zhou Zuoren: this was with the intention of provoking discord.</p>
<p>"Actually," concerning me personally, it's really unnecessary to "make a fuss," and the problem lies in not just me personally. This time, stimulation is being treated as lying and severely criticized. So I have to "make a fuss" again.</p>
<p>When the word "stimulation" appears in the pen of a casual talker, if it is not interpreted differently, then I say that all literature has stimulation. Even if it describes the most ordinary life of the most ordinary people, as long as you read it carefully, you will find its characteristics and discover differences from your own life, and you will have feelings. Where do these feelings come from? I say: from "stimulation."</p>
<p>If people read it and have no feelings afterward, if reading it is the same as not reading it, can that still be considered literature?</p>
<p>Even taking Mr. Zhou Zuoren as an example (not interpreting it as me being satisfied or dissatisfied with him), his writing is also full of stimulation. He is accustomed to writing about social contradictions from small things, he is accustomed to writing about the sense of prosperity and decline of the past and present from daily necessities, and he often uses these to stimulate readers. If stimulation is lying, then isn't Zhou Zuoren also lying?</p>
<p>However, it is said that he is not lying.</p>
<p>The existence of stimulation in writing did not begin today, nor did it begin in China. When people move life and thoughts onto paper, stimulation also exists along with it. If you want to deny stimulation, unless you completely overthrow literature.</p>
<p>As for writing about snow-white thighs, trembling breasts, and swindling some money to build foreign houses, that is a misuse of stimulation, which leads to anesthesia, leads to lying and deception, and harms young people. Stimulation is not involved in this.</p>
<p>There are people in the world who try to justify "lies" and advocate literature without stimulation. How can I not "wonder"?</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (32)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Hearing these words, everyone respectfully fell silent, just like after saying a prayer. Bociru, who was the most adept at flattery, said:</p>
<p>"Only women can have such profound and wonderful ideas."</p>
<p>Then he turned to old man Roland:</p>
<p>"Who exactly is this Maraisa? Are you really very close to him?"</p>
<p>The old man was moved by the wine and started to cry. He stuttered and said:</p>
<p>"Just like my own brother...you understand...a friend you can't find in this world now...we're always together...he has dinner at our house every night...he sometimes invites us to the theater...I can only tell you this...this...this...a friend, a true friend...a true friend...isn't that right, Louise?"</p>
<p>His wife replied briskly:</p>
<p>"Yes, he is a faithful friend."</p>
<p>Beal looked at his father and mother, but it was as if others were talking about something else. He started drinking again.</p>
<p>He couldn't remember how the grand party ended that night at all. Everyone drank coffee, wanted sweet wine, and made a lot of jokes. Then, around midnight, he went to sleep with a muddled mind and a dizzy head. He slept like an animal until nine o'clock the next morning.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The sleep soaked in champagne and chartreuse undoubtedly calmed and soothed him, because he woke up in very good spirits. As he dressed, he criticized, studied, and summarized his emotions from last night, trying his best to find the true secret cause of these emotions, both personal and external, clearly and completely.</p>
<p>Perhaps the girl at the beer hall really had an ugly thought, the thought of a prostitute, when she heard that one of Roland's two sons had inherited a stranger's estate alone; but don't these prostitutes often have the same suspicion of all chaste women for no reason? When they talk, don't we hear them curse, slander, and defame all women who are without moral defects? Whenever someone speaks of an irreproachable woman in front of them, they get angry, as if they have been insulted, and shout: "Ah! You know, I know these married women you are talking about, they are so 'clean'! You have more lovers than we do, but they are all hypocrites who hide their lovers. Ah! Yes, they are so clean!"</p>
<p>At other times, he certainly wouldn't have understood, wouldn't even have imagined that others would make such vulgar insinuations about his poor, kind, simple, and upright mother, but his heart was disturbed at that time by the yeast of jealousy fermenting within him. His spirit, stimulated intensely, was simply involuntarily spying on everything that could harm his brother. This spirit may even have assigned the waitress at the beer hall a hateful meaning that she didn't originally have. Maybe it was just his fantasy, his uncontrollable fantasy, often escaping his will, freely, bravely, adventurously, insidiously, mixing into the infinite world of thoughts, and sometimes bringing back some unspeakable, shameful thoughts from there, like stolen goods, hiding them on his body, hiding them in the depths of his soul, growing in those unexplored wall cracks: maybe it was just this fantasy that aroused and invented this terrible question. His heart, his upright heart, certainly had some secrets from him; and this wounded heart perhaps found a way to make his brother lose the inheritance he envied in this terrible suspicion. He is now suspicious of himself, questioning the mystery of his own thoughts, just like the devout ask their conscience.</p>

<h3>"Now"</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Living in such a confusing and contradictory society, most people commonly feel helpless and hopeless about reality. Therefore, many of them have lost the courage to struggle because they cannot bear the torment of this pain, and thus become passive and pessimistic. However, there are also some who are more willing to think with their brains. They all believe that this is a great regret and injustice: they all say in unison, "Is this what most of us should suffer?" However, this is just the most ordinary and common "injustice," or simply a "groan." Because they have never thought about how to remedy this defective "injustice," and they don't even know that they need to muster the greatest courage to fight for reality — at least to defend themselves. However, merely defending oneself is already too unambitious! Moreover, after they have been "complaining" for some time, perhaps they will also become passive and pessimistic. Otherwise, they will retreat, escape, and become two groups of alienated things who abandon the "now" and indulge in the sweet revelry of the past and expect the illusory warmth of the future!</p>
<p>These third kind of alienated people are like this: They feel that the "now" is so cruel and terrible that it cannot be approached, so they plan to avoid the "now," or comply with the "now," hoping to set aside the "now," even abandon it. And they are also willing to recklessly join the ranks of those so-called decadent poets and sentimental writers, so their daily life is to desperately recall and praise the sweetness, joy, revelry, etc. of the past, numbing their hearts from the root and corrupting their entire bodies; or to deceive themselves by expecting and singing the praises of the future's beauty, warmth, happiness, etc., so that they deeply fall into a romantic and illusory world and become a madman, a crazy person, a self-deluded person.... However, how long can their remembrance and expectation be enough to fulfill their wishes? The past is ultimately completely past. Can it be grabbed back? Can it be turned back? As for the future, it is obstructed by this long segment of the "now." How can this long segment be crossed? Can this long segment be crossed or thrown away? Moreover, should the so-called "now" be acknowledged as truly existing? If it exists, will it finally arrive one day? When the "future" arrives, won't it also become the "now"? Will everything that is expected and dreamed of in the "present now" be brought quickly and smoothly all at once when the "future now" arrives? If not, then he can only hide in bed all day long, hide in the quilt and daydream. Therefore, these alienated people are the most pitiful. On the one hand, they personally suffer from the pain given to them by the "now." On the other hand, they also suffer from the sadness of the disillusionment of remembrance and expectation, and turn into sentimental, decadent, romantic, numb, corrupt, and degenerate soulless fools, madmen, and idiots who open their eyes and dream while awake!</p>
<p>This is the mistake of neglecting the "now," despising the "now," and failing to grasp the "now"! However, how should the "now" be grasped? The answer is very simple: Although the "now" is cruel, terrible, and unapproachable, its essence is bright, clean, gentle, and most lovable, approachable, and reliable. As for why it becomes cruel, terrible, and unapproachable, please let the readers "the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom" to answer each other. The confusion and contradiction reflected in it, which leads to the helplessness and pain of despair felt by most people, is also inevitable (temporary) and not surprising. The problem is only that since people feel pain and dissatisfaction with it, then they must be determined to find a way to make it "satisfying": First, don't be pessimistic, don't retreat, don't comply with the "now," and don't abandon the "now." Second, give up the empty, unrecoverable past and the vague, unforeseeable future. Third, create the "now," and step on this long, uncrossable and undiscardable thorny "now," and fight and struggle for the "now"! After the victory, the ________, ________, ________, sweetness, and joy will eternally belong to most people.</p>

<h3>Such Students</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>I enthusiastically and warmly plunged into the education field to serve, I am afraid that the facts will disappoint me and make me return! In my previous ideals, being an elementary school teacher was bound to get the greatest comfort in spirit. That innocent group of lively children, how lovable! I imagined that the little brains of the children were pure, sensitive, and creative, and they were bound to be happy to obey. The small, frank heart was welcomed us to transport everything useful to them and let us irrigate them. Their behavior was lively, exquisite, and lovable without fatigue... But, but who knew! One year of experience, I cannot but feel deeply disappointed and have a sense of shrinking. Ah 丨 This group of little things that are afraid to approach 丨</p>
<p>Everyone is saying this: "Students are the masters of the future of China," "Creators of a healthy China," "Backbone of the revolution," "Soul of the country"... But are such students the masters of the future of China? Creators of a healthy China? The soul of the country? Backbone of the revolution? Wake up! Those who hope like this! Because you have believed too much, it will make you more disappointed and suffer greater wounds. At first, what we believed in were students studying abroad, wanting to entrust them with the responsibility of saving and building the country, wanting them to save and build, but the result disappointed us. So we shifted this kind of hope to college and middle school students, wanting to rely on them to save and build, but what was the result? Similarly, we felt disappointed again. So we had to hold on to infinite hope, hoping that children could give us what we wanted, but based on the current situation, it will also disappoint us in the same way. Then where will we shift our hope to? Who should we expect from? Everything is disappointing. This only remaining elementary school student gives us a sense of grief!</p>
<p>The education method that China should take should not be laissez-faire or other purpose methods. Only strictness still has some room for recovery. Elementary school students are too mindless. A "careless" teacher is what they welcome most, but our colleagues are unwilling to do this conscienceless careless thing, so being cursed secretly by elementary school students is of course inevitable. Therefore, after class, when we talked to each other, we really felt the pain of being in the same boat. We really feel a little helpless towards this generation. Holding a teaching position, yet unable to betray our conscience, to these students, scolding them is like the wind blowing past their ears. Hitting them will hurt for a while. Confining them to night school is not a big deal either, because it can be easily excused at home in front of their parents by telling a lie. Learning or not learning is completely forgotten. Asking them questions, they simply answer "I don't understand." Being punished to stand in the classroom is even less of a big deal. So we all say: "There is nothing difficult in the world, only afraid of a thick face. How to teach such students? So, gradually, teachers become disgusted with these elementary school students and are afraid to approach students. This is no different from a flock of sheep losing its shepherd. How can stray sheep who have lost their shepherd avoid falling into a wrong path?"</p>
<h3>"Won the Lottery"</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>Lan ran into the office doorway, and the colleagues said to her: "Lan, you are so late: tell you a good news, wasn't the aviation lottery drawn at Yiyuan on October 31st? Mr. W went to buy a strip the day before yesterday. When he bought it, we all said that his number was particularly strange and had a good chance of winning the lottery. Sure enough! Now looking at the newspaper, he won the fourth prize. In a week, he can collect two hundred bright and round silver dollars from the bank! He promised us to treat us to thirty yuan's worth of food. Ah: a Zhongshan head, without laboring the body and mind, he can get two hundred yuan. How comfortable it is to get it without labor! Who isn't envious? Like us sitting in this sour and poor room all day long, without any attempt, without any hope. I heard that there will be the next issue, and the third issue. Can't afford to buy the whole sheet, no matter what, I have to buy a strip. If I get lucky, I will become a millionaire in an instant! Ha, it's so interesting to taste the flavor of a rich man!" Lan ran downstairs because of something and expressed her congratulations to Mr. W with an envious look, saying: "Congratulations! Won the lottery." When Lan saw Mr. W.</p>
<p>The time was already twelve o'clock. The packaged meal was delivered; "Mr. W won the lottery! Let's order a table of three yuan's worth of dishes to treat him!" Mr. C suggested, and everyone agreed to his idea. So he sent the servant to order the dishes first. Mr. C was wandering in the dining room, using Mr. W's thirty yuan in his mouth, what to eat lunch at Xinya first, then watch a movie at Daguanming, and then eat western food at the YMCA..., constantly planning. The dishes are coming, and they are eating enthusiastically. At the end of the meal, Mr. W showed us the lottery number. Oh, my God, what did he win? He didn't even touch the tail number! They felt very funny themselves that they were deceived by this joke.</p>
