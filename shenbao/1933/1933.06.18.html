<p>（倫敦）今日經濟大會内最重要發展當推德俄邦交上所發生之嚴重事件、蓋德總代表胡根培所送提議返還殖民地說帖内、載有戰爭革命與國内之分崩離柝、皆有蘇俄爲出發點、目下此種行爲仍在前進中、亟當加以制止等語、蘇俄外長李維諾夫遂認爲誣衊蘇俄經濟委員會主席柯里恩雖加極大壓力於胡根培、勸其自動撤回、胡仍不允、乃以所提問題不在議程範圍以内拒絶接受並將印就之副本悉行銷燬、但李維諾夫猶餘憤未息向報紙發一聲明痛斥胡根培之誣衊蘇維埃政府、謂德政府此舉徒自取笑於世界而已、並向莫斯眞理報通訊員稱、渠見德人說帖内含有德國欲向東擴張意、旣而更有一驚人訊息、德代表團忽發一半官式聲明、表示說帖爲胡根培個人私意、並非代表團正式文件、現聞胡根培已於今夜返柏林、外傳出於德政府召回之說雖被否認、但亦承認胡氏或將不復出席會議、此間並有胡氏恐將辭去商務農業總長、而由經濟次長彭格來英代爲經濟會議代表之謠云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於德國撤回備忘錄事消息多相抵觸、經濟會議休息室内對於此事頗轟動一時、其事實經過大致可推斷如下今晨經濟會議秘書處接得德國備忘錄、原係由德國政府全體負責、嗣因會塲中情緒激奮、德國代表團乃將備忘錄停止分送、並說明此係胡根培個人意見、、當由彼向經濟委員會提出云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c45">正告席太平洋國際學會代表東 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>太平洋國際學會第五屆年會已决定於八月十四日在坎拿大舉行。其預定討論之議題。有經濟之爭鬭與自裁國際調解之工具與機關。以及敎育問題等。我國代表已有抵滬候輪。即將首途赴會者在太平洋上波詭濤譎風雲變幻莫定之秋。而各國代表　照例集會。歡聚一堂。雍容討論。其和平謙讓之態度及努力國際合作之精神。亦誠足多。</p>
<p>吾人猶記上屆太平洋國際學會之集會正當九一八事變發生之後及本屆集會。而華北停戰協定。乃已簽定。該會本爲謀國際合作而創設。然而討論自討論。侵略自侵略。一年半餘以來。我國已蹙地數百萬方哩。主權被破壞。土地被攘奪。人民被蹂躪。則該會之集議討論。究何所爲。又有何補益。其問題可不待解答而淸楚矣。嘗憶上屆該會對於東北問題。力謀避免提及。會前煞費苦心。即於開會時。各國代表亦罕有作仗義之言者。又足證明該會中之所謂「學者」「名流」者。無不顧及其國家立塲。倡言立論。各以其本國之利害爲前提。所謂國際合作之學者之公正態度。要亦爲欺人之談耳。</p>
<p>吾人旣已了然於該會之本質矣。則對於該會。固亦不必存有若何。之奢望。然而我國代表行將起程。吾人亦有不得不以誠意　諸我代表者即（一）此行必須斟酌自身之立塲。倡言立論。處處須先顧及國家體面與民族精神。且須求其不背於我國大多數人民之意旨。一切謬論。如對於東北問題之解决主張等候五十年。如獻計敵人停止武力侵略。改換手段征服我民族精神等。吾人切盼其不爲國際會場中所聞。（二）今日國際政治之　勢。固仁者見仁。智者見智。不必全同。然而三年來之事實。固爲世人所共見。日帝國主義者對我國之侵略。益見積極。要亦爲任何人所不能否認。列强正紛紛鈎心鬥角。各惟其私利是競。所謂國際和平。國際合作。要亦都爲欺騙弱小民族之烟幕。此觀於列强備戰之積極。即可覘知。吾人亦切盼我國代表。能認淸當前之事實。勿醉心於國際學者之美名。而發表爲國人所齒冷之言論。（三）勿徒眩耀其英語之流利。而忘却某一問題之本質。甚至討論中國問題。而依外國人之觀點。以中立態度而發言。凡此三者爲吾人對我國代表最低限度之希望。亦爲僅有之希望。太平洋國際學會。固負有「以學者之立塲。用宣傳及敎育之方法。改正政治家錯誤」之責任。然而徵之往昔。吾人殊未敢信該會之能自盡其責任也。</p>

<p>突破六十年來紀錄</p>
<p>揚子江整委會急謀防災</p>
<p>長江水位實行廣播報告</p>
<p>京訊、本年天氣自入夏以來、長江上游因霉雨連綿、江水日漸高漲、又經日前傾盆大雨後、襄河復奔流而、下江身不克容納、致有頓時泛濫漸成災象之勢主管當局及流域以内五省居民、鑒於前年巨災之覆轍、莫不惴惴危懼、日日社記者特訪揚子江整理委員會工務處長宋希尙、叩詢日來長江水位高漲之程度、曁防堤救濟之計畫承答如下、</p>
<p>水位突破紀錄據宋氏謂、揚子江因年來限於經費、整理計畫未能實施、致江道日見淤塞、容納水量日漸减少、如連綿大雨、即易飛漲成災、且追溯歷年長江水高漲時期、均在七八月之間、就念年水位災而論、六月半長江水位尙祇三十九呎半、嗣至七月底漲至五十呎、至八月半高漲到五十三呎半、釀成空前災患、惟今年本月（六月）中旬、經前日滂沱在雨後長江水位突漲至四十一呎、爲一八七零年來（計六十一年）同月（六月）未有如此高度之水位、實打破六十年來之最高紀錄、如稍再有風雨、即可釀成巨災之危、且此時并不在水患時期、昔年水漲必至七月半至八月半間、惟目今水已奇漲、一至水患時期、當更可慮、希望今後雨量稀少、水位降落、或可避免洪水之患、</p>
<p>水漲急謀防救宋氏繼謂、長江堤岸自經二十年潰决後、現在所有修築新堤之决口尙無舊堤之堅固、現揣測新堤之本身、與水漲之形勢、實大抱隱憂、關於救濟防堤計畫、應由鄂省政府與江漢工程局共負其責、但至現在非常時期、觀乎該兩機關、似有互相推諉責任、本會因主管整理長江之責、刻一面商促以上負責兩機關急謀計畫、一面妥擬防堤危災救濟辦法、以防未雨綢繆、至培護堤岸之高度、自上年水災後、據本會照泛濫時程度假定算水位最高度至五十八呎、而堤身須培高至五十八呎以上、方能容積流入水量、合併與江心之水也、</p>
<p>廣播長江水位宋氏末謂、至長江各埠按日水位之漲、落關係異常巨大、務使當地及各方澈底明瞭、本會有見及此、曾特呈請交通部、轉咨財政部、飭令長江各埠各海關、每日上午九時、專電報告該地當日之水位與本會、以便向中央廣播電台報告、自十五日起、已接鎭江金陵等海關專電報告水位、即送中央電台廣播、在報告氣候時、加以長江水位報告、自今以後、中央電台每日均有長江水位低漲之報告云云（十六日）</p>

<p>中央電令宋子文進行</p>
<p>胡漢民誤會覆電解釋</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、昨晨在哥倫比亞路寓次、接見各報社記者、述及中美借欵、及用途等各項問題、孫氏首謂、此次中美借欵、宋子文係根據中央意旨進行、蓋宋氏出國後、國防委員會乃召集會議、討論我國對於華府會議之具體方案、衆意咸覺中國之農林經濟、已瀕破產、影響於國計民生、及世界經濟者至鉅、應急予設法救濟、故决議訓令宋氏、希望美國在物質上帮助中國、復興經濟、經宋氏奉令、在美再三磋商、棉麥借欵、始告成立、</p>
<p>棉麥用途孫氏繼謂、此次美棉美麥借欵、原爲一種短期信用借欵與普通之外債性質、完全不同美棉規定貨到中國、三月之内、先付貨價十分之一、</p>
<p>餘則分期償還、將來之用途、先將棉麥廉價售於商人、再將所得貨欵、用以開發西北及建設交通與水利、立法院昨日（十六日）已將中美借欵合同提出通過、並議决組織一借欵管理委員會、以免浪費、惟如何組織、與人選之支配、均須待中央政治會議决定、</p>
<p>胡氏誤會留居香港之胡展堂先生、對於中美借欵、頗多誤會、曾致電本人、表示反對、胡氏所持之理由、第一點、爲此次借欵、係宋部長個人之行動、未經立法院通過、第二點、爲過去之内債、均消耗於内戰、此次中美借欵成立、恐内戰又將爆發、立法院應予否認本人現已電復胡氏詳爲解釋首述此次借欵、係根據中央所定原則並非宋氏個人之行動、立法院係對中央負責、此次借欵旣係中央意旨、當然並非違法、繼述此次借欵、用於建設及生產、絶對不消耗於内戰、如能保管嚴密、當然不致浪費、立法院業已議决組織借欵管理委員會、防止浪費、現已呈請中政會採納矣、</p>
<p>經濟會議倫敦經濟會議、以英美法三國爲重心、中國之關係較少、美國近以農產過剩、貨價低落、農工購買力薄弱、失業者已達一千餘萬人、此爲資本主義之矛盾、故美國採取通貨膨脹政策、以謀救濟、法國則主張恢復金本位、英國則主張先行訂定呆板匯兌價格、將來再行恢復金本位、各國均因利害衝突、主張各異、我國主張提高銀價、並使銀價穩定、穩定銀價與各國均有利益、可望通過、宋部長大約於七月底、或八月初歸國、</p>
<p>憲草審查孫氏最後謂憲法初稿草案現已脫稿、正在審查之中、吾方貢獻之意見甚多、現决將初稿草案先交小組會議審查、再交憲法草案委員會討論、然後提付立法院通過後、呈請中央政治會議核定、將來再以中央執行委員會之名義提交國民大會通過、憲法始告正式成立云、</p>

<p>陳彬龢編全書二一四頁</p>
<p>紙面三十二開本實價洋五鏵角</p>
<p>本書分三編編譯與改寫的；</p>
<p>第一編丨日本史的研究，是根據日本左傾學者佐野學生生的物觀日本歷史編譯的，在分量上雖祗有原書的三分之一，但原書的精華尙保存着。這本書的價値，是在着眼於一切社會發展之衝動力的物質的生產關係而立論的，不像舊的日本史學家曲解歷史，專門注目於英雄豪傑與帝王的事蹟，而蒙蔽歷史上的勞苦大衆的偉力。原著者佐野學先生去年年底爲日本當局判决無期徒刑，現正在獄中。據說他在去年來到上海，正要上岸時爲日本警察所逮捕。當在東京警察署審問時，他不答一言，索紙只寫了「士可殺不可辱」六個大字。這樣偉大的人格，是値得我們致敬的。</p>
<p>第二編丨國際形勢中之日本，是根據伐爾加「ｖａｒｇａＥｕｇｅｎ匈牙利人」的世界經濟年報第十七期第一部材料改寫的。（日本經濟批判會釋本，昭和七年七月叢文閣發行）他是世界經濟學者的權威，對於國際形勢中之日本，從經濟的觀點上分析，當然很正確的。</p>
<p>第三編丨日本軍事費之膨脹與其財政这危機，是根據東洋經濟新報社發行的日本經濟年報第十一期第二部份材料編譯的。（昭和八年二月出版）此書爲日本出版界中比較可靠的經濟材料，牠對於今日日本財政之危機，不諱事實，翔明叙述，頗多參考的價値。</p>

<p>編者說到國人研究日本問題的必要，在序文中有這樣的說明；</p>
<p>「日本有一個故事，相傳太古之世有兩隻蛙，一住京都井中，一住大阪蓮塘中，兩地相去四十哩。某日，各自本鄉出發，打算去探尋别地的奇情異事。牠們最後到了一個地方，正在京都和大阪的中間，牠倆都用後脚穩穩地站起來，第一次眺望遼遠的異域。可惜蛙的眼睛是生在　部的後面，因之眼光便只能看到背後的一切，所以都兩隻蛙除了看到牠們自己的故</p>
<p>鄉的景物以外，什麽奇情異事也没有看到。牠們就此悶悶地各回到原處，牠們参爲京都就是大阪的複形，而大阪也就是京都的複形。一直到現在，這兩隻蛙，依然不知道而且不相信井中與蓮塘之外，還有遼闊的世界。</p>
<p>「在中國的古書上也有這樣類似的方喻，」</p>
<p>莊子上書，「井　（亦作蛙）不可以語於海者，拘於虚也。」後漢書馬援傳也說，「公孫述帝於蜀，援謂瑰囂曰，子陽井底蛙耳。」這裏所說的蛙當然都是用來方喻一般識見狹小固步自封自人們的。</p>
<p>「就近百年來之情形而言，我國或者亦難免於井蛙譏罷。雖說我國成爲日本帝國主義者政治的經濟的侵略對象，成爲日本帝國主義者海洋政策與大陸政策之下的犧牲品，於今亦已數十年，可是對於對岸的鄰居丨一個最兇惡的帝國主議者，却仍没有根本的認識。觀察對岸的鄰居的時候，有的人和那一對蛙一樣，在固執地用頭部後面的眼睛去眺望，有的人簡直閉着眼不看，所以一部分的士大夫與學者之流，直至今日，還有的在希望我們的鄰居趕快覺醒，不再動武；有的希望一面抵抗，一面還有一個交涉的餘地？有的向我們的鄰居獻計說，「不如停止「全琥行」」，改用征服我民族精神　　「遠東的風雲一天一天地緊漲了，現在不是環境已不容許我們老作「井底之蛙」了麽？不是逼着我們向前進行，用前面的眼睛去熟識我們對岸的鄰居？·····」</p>

<p>「筆者回顧過去若干年，旣說不天有什麽研究的成績，對於國人也没有什麽貢獻，念此輙爲汗顏。但其間筆者於中日問題之觀察，則有一極大之轉變；卽十七年筆者從日本回後，雖一方面懼怕日本研究我國各笙種問題的精細，一方面覺得我們趕快研究「日本」的必要，但仍存着中日兩國親密合作的希望。從十九年冬到東北視察後，纔知道中華民族在日本帝國主義者侵略政策之下，如其不展開民族革命的旗幟，是决没有出路的，凡阳高唱「中日兩國親善」，「共存共榮」，與「妥協」，「和平」者都只是「井底之蛙」。迨在九一八禍變爆發，更證實了此一觀察之正確所以我們假使不能認淸日帝國主義者的侵略政策，就不配研究日本，不配做日本帝國主義者的敵人，只能做日本帝國主義者的奴隸，但同時近年來從日本國内思想上的動搖而觀察，又可知日帝國主義者正奔向没落之路，新日本快要到來了！我們確信日本勞苦大衆，丨創造新日本的每一個細胞丨不久將負担新時代的新任務」</p>

<p>㈣事務行政設施槪况</p>
<p>本校事務行政以秘書處爲最高機關、前時設總務、註册兩課、總務課設文書、庶務、印務、醫務及會計出納各組、以辦理所屬事務、註册課專辦、</p>
<p>理敎務會議所决定之議案、即負敎務上執行之責、最近註册課改隸敎務委員會、總務課裁撤、將原有之文書、庶務、印務、醫務（改稱衛生）、及會計、出納各組擴大爲課、使敎務與事務權限劃淸、辦事手續更爲便利、惟本校經費、向極支絀、每月行政費僅有五千餘兩、連特别、設備、實騐等費在内、辦事自感困難、但能在困難中、極力撙節、設法使事務能逐步進展、此實由負責人員之指導有方、現任秘書長仍爲楊裕芬先生、秘書爲曾克耑、鮑壽康兩先生、文書、庶務、印務、衛生四課課長仍爲陳中孚、鮑壽康兼、陳其英唐斐禮四先生、會計出納兩課、仍由奚玉書、王海帆兩會計師代辦、茲將各課年來所辦重要事項槪述如下</p>
<p>文書方面辦事人員雖不多、因取分工合作而所辦文件、成績頗爲可觀、關於全校規章、雖組織有法規委員會審訂、但仍由文書課負責收集與草擬、二十一·二年度一覧之集編、檔案之整理等事項、均有相當成績、</p>
<p>庶務方面庶務爲學校行政中所最難辦理之事務、本校庶務以經費困難、尤覺爲難中之最難、唯以管理得法、尙具成效、就工作便利起見、分爲幾部份</p>
<p>一、工務、自一二八戰後、除重要修理工程由戰後整理委員會辦理外、其他槪由工務辦理、全校道路之修築、花卉之栽培、厠所这改建、浴室之刷新等等、均有極顯著之成績、至本校電燈、前由閘北電燈公司供給、每月需費千餘圓、殊不經濟、特於去年暑假期間努务撙節其他消耗、自辦電燈廠、每月連油料、人工僅費四百餘圓、本校因僻處鄉鎭、飲料全須自給、故有自流井之設備、但滬戰時所有機件、水管等均被敵人破壞、故特再購十匹馬力柴油引擎一架、打出之水、經市衛生局試騐、極合衛生、又本校以地方　闊、各部份隔離頗遠、有事接洽、極感不便、以前電話、僅屬對外通話、現全校各部份均裝置分機、以節省往來接洽之時間、而增進辦事之效能、二、勤務、全校工役之管理、均訂有各種規程、切實施行、且全校工役均着制服、并佩帶號證、不但在表面上整齊可觀、而實際上亦容易查者、至對工役之待遇、經切實改良、每月工資均先行淸發、復設立工役夜校、加以訓練、以增進其智識及工作能力、</p>
<p>三、購置、本校爲厲行提倡國貨、凡庶務所採購之物品、儘量採用國貨、倘國貨中確無可替代者、始不得已用外國貨、仇貨是絶對不用、至對各商號之往來賬目、按月淸還、决不拖欠、</p>
<p>此外若收支、收發、保管等部份均依照規定辦法、辦事手續旣輕便、考核亦簡易、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>吳諺從狀態上批評人物，呌做什麽相；從實質上批評人物，呌做什麽坯。說到相字，有褒有貶；說到坯字，有　貶無褒。</p>
<p>相字有褒有貶，例如；有了好相，也有壞相；凡是福氣相，乾凈相，好看相，有做相，都是褒的名詞。凡是呌化相，齷齪相，討壓相，輕薄相，都是貶的名詞。</p>
<p>坯字有貶無褒，例如；只有壞坯子，没有好坯，；凡是强盜坯，流氓坯，討氣坯，討飯坯，賴學坯，呌化坯闖禍坯，以至戇坯，死坯，打坯，殺坯，都是貶的名詞。可見坯字裏面，大槪尋不出一個褒的名詞。</p>
<p>相字坯字以外，還有形容人的嘴臉，皮臉，眉臉，大槪都是貶的名詞。例如；蹺嘴朶臉，　嘴　臉，鈍皮老臉，皺眉苦臉。</p>
<p>還有形容人的式樣和神氣，呌做某樣某氣，這也是貶的名詞。例如；形容人的不知活運，呌做死樣怪氣；形容人的落了靜功，呌做陰樣怪氣。近人把陰樣怪氣，寫作陰陽怪氣，實在是錯誤的；樣字換了陽字，完全没有意思。假如，陰樣怪氣，可以寫作陰陽怪氣，那麽，死樣怪氣，也可以寫作死陽怪氣麽？旣知死陽怪氣不成爲名詞，那麽，陰陽怪氣，當然也不成爲名詞了，誤樣爲陽，不可不糾正一下子。</p>
<h3 id="c201">刮鬚 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 龍騷</p>
<p>最近以前；一位朋友送給我一柄Ｖａｌｅｔ的剃刀。因此素來不愛好修飾的唇上鬚脚的黑髭與鬚，有了剿除的工具，在百無聊賴的時候，借它的鋒銳，用足手段，給肅淸得半根不留。</p>
<p>光滴滴的面部，有人會說我還只二十左右的年靑人，我的妻，也因此常會撅直了小小的紅唇，摟住我的頸項，親摯地願和我接吻，聯成一對精緻的口瓶。瓶裏交流着甘露，會滋潤到寂寞的生命之花。那時候，我感到舒服，靈魂生了紅翼飛，一種温暖的愛流包圍了整個身體，於是我感激剃刀，禮讚剃刀，甚至明白了「刀在世界上的偉大的功能。」</p>
<p>只要有刀，可以薙除，自家不願意它存在的一切東西，說是殺人也可以，剿匪也可以，抵抗日本也可以，所謂刮鬚，還是「事之小焉者耳。」</p>
<p>可是就因爲我崇拜着刀，同時感覺到鬍髭的討厭，我便不時把刀磨得銀子一般亮，在鏡中，瞧見自家怎樣運用機巧，把不抵抗的鬍髭一根根，一批批，刮將下來。我便笑了，我的妻，又急忙跑過來，撫摩我滿頭柔鬈的長髮。</p>
<p>要從璷面刦回我已失去了的「靑春的驕傲」，除了刮鬚這一着妙棋外，就束手無策了。起初是一星期一刮，繼着四五天一刮，到見在却非二三日中一刮不可了，而且那鬚又粗又勁，不像從前那樣的柔馴，怕刀鋒有一天會被折掉吧？　　後來我才明白；因爲没有把鬚根刮盡，所以它會更速度的復活，那非根本剿除是别無辦法的了。</p>
<p>「鬍鬚却越刮越多了呀！」我的妻這樣說。</p>
<p>于於我開始懷疑起「刀的武力」的不足恃。但眼見自家的鬚，鬚　得像剌蝟，形態是可怖的，我反悔恨從前迷信「刀的權威」之失計，然而反悔有什麽用呢　　想到「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」的詩句就更證實了「欲滅鬚長，必劖其根。」但友人Ｌ，他是慣用銀鉗來拔鬚的，可是他的額下，依然叢集掁靑色的影。丨這樣說，鬚在生理上是必然長生的東西，它有着一種潛伏着的精力，凡是成熟年齡以上的人，都有這不可避免的騷擾的點綴。專持「刀的武力」去鎭抑，去痛勦，又怎能保證它不反抗而絶跡呢！</p>
<p>世界上刮鬚的人，當然不止我一個，可惜他們壓根兒不懂得這點哲學。於是乎戰爭便不斷地到處發生了。</p>

<h3 id="c203">枇杷船 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 勞人</p>
<p>「樹繁碧玉葉，柯疊黃金丸，」這是古人詠枇杷的絶句。五月仲夏，果實大熟，鴛湖畔頻添了一種特殊點綴品。舳　相接的小舟，滿載枇杷在狹小的河道，來往如穿花之蝶。鄉人丨抱着十二分的希望，只爲他們一年的收獲，也就是在這幾天！</p>
<p>這種小舟來源，歷史悠久，已不可考。完全是塘棲鎭的土著。每年將到枇杷應世時候，他們開始下總動員令，把自己汗血換得的果實，滿筐滿船，羣向鴛湖輸送。據說；嘉興是黃金地，可得善價而沽的。但是，一般的人們，認爲枇杷船的出品。較城肆價廉，所以都趨之若驚了！</p>
<p>塘棲，係杭縣所屬一個小鎭。距離喜嘉興約百數十里，鎭中民風樸厚，鄉人勸於耕種，無家不種枇杷，遂造成中國唯一的天然果園。產品確可與洞庭山相媲美，每年產銷額，約二三百萬元。他們除運銷上海，杭州，南京各大埠外；嘉與就是第二　銷市塲。每年麕集城廂内外的小舟，多至百餘艘。營業每日以千元計，已大有可觀。不過嘉興人的枇杷癖，較任何處爲大，「家家户户吃枇杷」因此促成盛銷。</p>
<p>枇杷船的構造，和西子湖畔的游艇相似而微。船中除滿裝枇杷外，另闢一席地足供舟子睡眠炊飯之需，從塘棲到嘉興，最少二日方可到達。所以鄉人出門一次，總是滿載，到達目的地後，日夜努力工作，在營業最盛的時期，枇杷一船，三四日即可售盡，於是將所換得的銀錢，易米帛而歸。一年一度，從不間斷，他們的生活，淸白神聖値得令人欽仰敬佩！</p>
<p>昨日今朝大不同，人事變幻，國難當頭，影響竟波及於神聖的枇杷船，今年逈非昔比，塘棲鎭的臨時果船，大都裹足不前；即有，亦寥寥可數。據聞官廰方面，稅無可征，遽在他們身上着想，每隻納捐費兩元，美其名曰牌照捐。記者昨天偶和一個船中人閒談，他說；向來枇杷滿船，最多四五日即可銷盡，本年則大相逕庭，小舟來往河中，無人問津，以致鮮果霉爛，大受損失。現在是農村經濟崩潰時期，農民生活，困苦艱難，已達於極點。若再加壓農民。則農村經濟，永無舒定之日了。唉！苛捐猛於虎，」吾復何言。</p>

<p>第九回謔語豈無由東床暗引突來良有以西席閑籌</p>
<p>江氏忽然在身，呌起來道；老姑娘，你這是怎麽了？拿了一隻火筷子，只管在爐子眼裏搗。我瞧你，總搗過一百下了。你再要向下搗，非把爐子搗通來不可，桂枝這才醒悟過來，心裏想着，我鎭靜一點罷，别露怯了，就笑道；媒球燒大發了，變成了一塊，不這樣搗，碎不了。他趕快的添上了煤球，立刻就回屋子裏一鑽。江氏道；那位黃小姐到後面院子裏去了有這樣久的時候，也不知道是不是在咱們家吃午飯，你瞧了去。桂枝道；我不瞧，我也不管。江氏道；你這是什麽話？昨天人家請你吃了，今天你不管。桂枝道；我不是說我不管招待人家，我不管到後院去找他。江氏道；你不去，我去，要不然，人家眞會說咱們太不懂道理。江氏說着，人就要向克走。桂枝跑了上前，一把扯住他的袖口道；你也别去。代氏倒爲之愕然，望了他道；那爲什麽？可是桂枝臉上，就帶些微紅，而且又由微紅裏，泛出一些淺笑。江氏看了這種樣子，倒有些尶𡯓，便道；你是不是說，人家在談心，咱們别去打岔？桂枝鼓了嘴道；我那裏知道？江氏看了這樣子，心裏也明白過來，就跟着一笑。這樣一來，桂枝更有些疑心了。江氏心理，料着黃曼英是不會來吃飯的了，也就不再說什麽。直到這日下午，黃曼英才笑嘻嘻的走了出來，隔了窗户呌道；楊老太，我要進城了打攪您啦。江氏聽了這話，不能不走出來送他。他看見江氏出來了，趕快就向前面走，到了大門口，他站定了，等着江氏走近來，者低聲笑道；老太太，老實對你說一句，我這回出城來，是替你們帮忙來了。據見在的情形看起來，大致是不錯。這就不知道你們的意思怎麽樣？大槪一二天關連長就會到府上來，等他到了府上的時候，有什麽話只管對他說就是了。（一○三）</p>

<p>小朋友，娛樂對你們是一件很重要的事情，你們每天放了學回到家裏，做些什麽玩意兒呢？有許多不正當的遊戲對你們是有損無益的，你們對於那些腐舊的玩意兒不感到單調乏味嗎？這裏我貢獻你們幾種新的玩意兒，如果你們依照着而實行，對你們的身心二方都感到興味和益處，現在你們仔細看罷。</p>

<p>把一個銅元放在桌子的邊上，一半露出桌面，請一個人站着桌子兜圈子，在經過的桌子銅元敲下來。這件事似乎很簡易吧？但玩的時候可不像這末容易，第一他要閉上一隻眼睛，再在敲那銅元之前，還須轉一個身，這樣就不容易了吧？因爲閉了一隻眼睛，視線失長短度就有差别，轉了個身，神經系也微有震動，銅元的地位就看不在正確了。用小指也就是比中指食指要困難些的緣故。這個遊戲的玩法如果人數多，可把二個桌子拼起來，每人離二三步前後慢慢的跑，跑時不可有意站停，敲落次數最多者勝。</p>

<p>這是個很發噱的遊戲，目的是練習手各足的運用和陶冶心思的鎭定，玩時可分二人爲一組，每人都用手帕把自己的眼睛遮住，每人的手中都拿半碗茶，（或可可等等聽便，）和一隻茶匙，二人證面站立，距離大約伸手可及，另派一人爲公證人，喊一二三後，二人便開始把茶匙存茶互相餵着喝，只可喂在對主的口裏，潑出作爲無效，如此每組同樣的做，先餵完而潑出最少者爲勝。這個遊戲玩的時候，留心餵的時候不可着急，着急就慌忙的找不到對方的口，就致潑了出而餵到别的地方，公證人有個重大的責任，就是餵時不准嘻笑，否則容易發生像嗆咳一類的事。</p>

<p>這是一個搶位置坐的遊戲。玩法是預備椅子數張，比玩的人數少一隻，在玩的以前，每人說出一個通訊處，（這可自由擬想的，）凡加入玩的人都須記住，由一人喊一二三後，大家上前搶位置坐，惟態度不可野蠻，結果有一個人搶不到位置的，這個人就算郵差，當郵差的就有送信的義務，信怎麽送法呢？他可以隨便把剛才記者的通信處說出二個來，聽見這通信處是自己的二個人，趕忙立起來互相換個位置坐，在這個換位置的當口，信差就可以搶他們的位置，搶到了由剩下的一個人做，搶不到，原做信差。這個遊戲的目的是練習記憶和機警的動作。</p>

<p>此法十人共玩，分二隊，每隊照捐。記，一守門，二後衛前鋒，站在桌旁相當的地位，將頭偏倚桌面，不准移動。開球後都盡將球吹人對方球門。球可用一紙團，或已壞之乒乓球半爿，球門則以任何物件分置二邊，這個遊戲因爲雙方的位置都不准移動，只憑一個人的力量决不會把球吹人對方門内的，所以也會有很高妙，的傳球出現，玩時注意攻人不備和防人之攻不備，所以往往乘對方守門換氣時把球攻進的。大人不可同小朋友一起玩，因爲他們的氣力不及啊！</p>

<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>浙東的有一處的戲班中，有一種脚色呌作「二花臉」，譯得雅一點，那麽，「二丑」就是。他和小丑的不同，是不扮橫行無忌的花花公子，也不扮一味仗勢的宰相家丁，他所扮演的是保護公子的拳師，或是趨奉公子的淸客。總之；身分比小丑高，而性格却比小丑壞。</p>
<p>義僕是老生扮的，先以諫諍，終以殉；惡僕是小丑扮的，只會作惡，到底滅亡。而二丑的本領却不同，他有點上等人模樣，也懂些琴棋書畫，也來得行令猜謎，但倚靠的是權門，凌蔑的是百姓，有誰被壓迫了，他就來冷笑幾聲，暢快一下，有誰被陷害了，他又去嚇嗁一下，吆喝幾聲。不過他的態度又並不常常如此的，大抵一面又回過臉來，向臺下的看客指出他公子的缺點，搖着頭裝起鬼臉道；你看這傢伙，這回可要倒楣哩！</p>
<p>這最末的一手，是二丑的特色。因爲他没有義僕的愚笨，也没有惡僕的簡單，他是知識階級。他明知道所靠的是冰山，一定不能長久，他將來還要到别家帮閒，所以當受着豢養，分着餘炎的時候，也得裝着和這貴公子並非一伙。　　二丑們編出來的戲本，當然没有這一種脚色的，他那里肯；小丑，即花花公子們編出來的戲本，也不會有，因爲他們只看見一面，想不到的。這二花臉，乃是小百姓看透了這一種人，提出精華來，製定了的脚色。</p>
<p>世間只要有權門，一定有惡勢力，有惡勢力，就一定有二花臉，而且有二花臉藝術。我們只要取一種刋物，看他一星期，就會發見見他忽而怨恨春天，忽而頌揚戰爭，忽而譯蕭伯納演說，忽而講婚姻問題；但其問一定有時要慷慨激昻的表示對於國事的不滿；這就是用出末一手來了。</p>
<p>這最末的一手，一面也在遮掩他並不是帮閒，然而小百姓是明白的，早已使他的類型在戲臺上出現了。</p>
<h3 id="c211">「三層樓」與「骨董」及其他 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 沈起予</p>
<p>近兩日的自由談上有達五和胡秋原兩君的關於「三層樓」及「骨董」的文章。恰巧自己也譯過這部書，於是一種恐陷於同樣的錯誤的懸念，使我將自己的譯文和原文查了一遍。現在「三層樓」的事也告解决，所以僅想談到「骨董」及其他，查此處原文係Ｂｉｂｅｌｏｔ一字，此字除了小裝飾品之意而外，有一種ＭｅｎｕｓｏｆｂｊｅＣｔＳｂｅｐｅｕｄｅＶａｌｅｕｔ（少價値的瑣碎東西）的意思，譯爲一骨董」，似有未妥。不過這過當不在胡君而實在於日譯者，因此我也感覺「重譯」之實在困難，雖然我亦間作俄文書籍的重譯。</p>
<p>同時伊可維茨的部書的日譯，除了「骨董」之類以及把「船長」譯爲「資本家」（見其論魯濱孫，克呂俊中）等的不注意而外，復亦有許多遺漏和不小的錯誤在。例如在論未來派一段中，竟把ＶｉｃｔｏｒｅｄｅＳａｍｏｔｈｒａｃｒｅ翻譯爲「沙墓特拉斯的勝利，實在令人看不懂是什麽一回勝利。原因是；Ｖｉｃｔｏｉｒｅ乃是希臘的女神，爲Ｐａｌｌａｓ與Ｓｔｙｘ的女兒，而ＶｉｃｔｏｉｒｅｄｉＳａｍｏｔｈｒａｃｅ乃是一八六三年在Ｓａｍｏｔｈｒａｏｏ島上發見的Ｖｉｃｔｏｉｒｅ的彫像。Ｖｉｃｔｓｉｏｒｅ雖有勝利之意，但那也不過是與Ｍｉｌｋｙｗａｙ（銀河）之有「牛奶路」之意同樣罷了　　重譯旣然不好，然而也不是照原文譯的譯本都好，即我的伊可維茨的譯本，也是令人汗顏的東西。又，近來讀武思茂君譯的馬查的「西方藝術史」（據說是直接從俄文譯的），許多地方使我無論如何讀不懂，待與日譯本相對照時，然後纔知是那麽一回事，而其中對於人名的註解，亦復有不少的錯誤，如把Ｃｈａｒｄｉｎ註爲Ｓａｒｇｅｎｔ，把Ｇｒｅｕｚｅ註爲ＧｒｏＳ（見開明版六頁）等。</p>
<p>錯雖爲人所不免，可是無論是重譯，或照原文譯，都是値得我們從事翻譯者的應當努一回力的。</p>
<h3 id="c212">睡藥 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>郎損先生在自由談上論說現代靑年如何迷惘于社會歷史的變幻，引起曹聚仁先生接着就寫了一篇「我的迷惘。」曹先生以李迫大夢爲例，李迫沉睡二十年醒來，雖然人世俱非，自己成了畸零的人，但他的專制兇悍的老婆已經死了；而曹先生呢，「在五四運動那時吃了睡藥，在半迷朦的狀態中過了十年，而今忽然驚醒的。」睜眼一看，和李迫一樣，人世俱非，自己成了非常畸零的人，但他的專制兇悍使人心悸的「老婆」并没有死，因此曹先生想再吃一點睡藥，再沉睡他一十下年。</p>
<p>很好，睡藥到是現存，不過希望曹先生慢一點呑下去，等我一步，在下是很想呑睡藥的人呀！</p>
<p>大約相要呑睡藥的還不只曹先生和我兩個呢！</p>
<p>呑睡藥不會有甚麽難處，我們很可以「管他娘」地沉睡一二十年，不過，倘使一二十年後醒過來的時候，那位專制兇悍的「老婆」仍舊没死的話，曹先生是否預定再呑一次呢？曹先生如果算得定那時「老婆」必然已經死去，那麽曹先生我們來吧。</p>
<p>再則，我還有一點過慮。我們不能没有「老婆，」而且我們是講自由戀愛的，即使那兇悍專制的「老婆」在我們沉睡期間死去了，但等我們醒來時新「老婆」又早已給人代定好了，那又怎樣呢？那時我們還是承認好呢還是不承認？</p>
<p>我怕那時曹先生又要覺得迷惘了，又要競競于反對新「老婆」了！</p>
<p>所以問題不在呑睡藥，而在想法子立刻離去現在這位專制兇悍的老婆，另覓美滿的愛侶。</p>

<p>— 王婉容</p>
<p>是個淸瘦的姑娘啊！我瞧着對門李家新買的丫頭阿凝扭擺的背影自語着。</p>
<p>一月來，没看見她穿過鞋。眞怪！怎麽她的左脚會少了一節脚趾呢？每當她泡水回來，我們總替她躭心；深怕她一個不當心跌倒了會給開水燙傷。瞧，走起路來一扭一忸的多使人担驚！</p>
<p>「凝姐兒，小心啊！幹嗎不穿雙襪子？最少鞋也得穿雙呀！給開水燙了不是要的。」</p>
<p>「慣了，」說話時，是一個怪可愛的笑臉。</p>
<p>「怎麽你的左脚會少了一節脚趾呢？」我看着她的脚，詫異地問。</p>
<p>「熒小姐，我下次有了閒再告訴您吧！你瞧我身上的這許多傷疤！」阿凝的悒鬰的眼光，射在自己的左脚上，經　地太息着。</p>
<p>眞　　　天着　　出來倒垃圾，泡水，送她們的小少爺上學，到河灘邊洗衣服，總没閒和我講她失去一節脚趾的緣故。逐漸地，她瘦削了下去，臉上的舊疤上，不時的見到增加了新的血痕。問她，只是紅了眼皮沉默着，變成化石樣的女孩了。</p>
<p>據她主人家的徐媽說；阿凝早已没了父母。八歲的時候，便給夫家領去做了童養媳，每天要燒飯，洗衣服，織布，下田耕種，可是公婆依然不痛她，有一夜，她悄悄地溜出來，走到半路，給丈夫發覺了，把她追了回去，關了幾天，便把她賣到了李家。</p>
<p>「爲什麽她的左脚會少了一節脚趾呢？」徐媽也和我一樣茫然。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三四天没有看見阿凝的扭擺的腰肢了。</p>
<p>「徐媽，怎麽啦，你家阿凝？」</p>
<p>「病了，熒小姐。」</p>
<p>「害什麽病？」</p>
<p>徐媽裝着没聽見似的走開了。</p>
<p>十天，二十天，一個月後還没有看見阿凝的踪跡。</p>
<p>「徐媽，怎末啦，你們阿凝的病還没好麽？」　　徐媽沉默着，她向四面瞧了瞧，走近我的身邊，低聲地；「死了，埋也埋了二十多天啦！」</p>
<p>「啊」我怔住了；「害什麽病死的？」</p>
<p>「嘿，熒小姐，今天天氣眞好哪！」徐媽突地放響了喉嚨。接着發出一串乾笑。</p>
<p>我茫然的瞧着她那掩蓋不住的驚惶的臉孔，我發見對門李家太太從樓窗口對我們射出了兩道炯炯的目光；「徐媽，」她銳聲的喊。</p>
<p>第二天，在樓頭，我瞧見徐媽挾着個小包袱披着晨曦走了。</p>
<p>「徐媽」想喊，我又瞥見對門李家太太在樓窗口向我注視着；</p>
<p>「哈，熒小姐，眞勤哪！您這早就起來了麽？」不自然地朝我招呼着。</p>
<p>漸漸地，我明白一切了。</p>

<p>— ＪｕｌｅＳＲｅｎａｒｏ作林取譯</p>
<p>釣鈎（續）</p>
<p>雷辟克想把宅拿掉。</p>
<p>「啊，不！不要這樣！」雷辟克家的尖聲說。</p>
<p>眞的，釣鈎完全全穿過了手指，一面露着尖鋒，另一面露着環孔。</p>
<p>雷辟克捻着單眼　看着。</p>
<p>「要命啦，」他說，「這要把釣鈎弄斷，才能取出來！」</p>
<p>怎麽能夠把釣鈎弄斷呢！雷辟克祗要稍爲用一點力，還没有抓牢她，她便跳起來呌喊着。難道人家在挖她的心，要她的命嗎？並且釣鈎是用極鋒利的鋼做的。</p>
<p>「那麽，要把肉割開才行。」雷辟克說。</p>
<p>他把單眼鏡放在眼睛上，拿出一把小刀來，開始在指頭上割着，可是刀口太鈍了，割不進去。他便把刀子按在肉上，用力地割，流出一些血來了。</p>
<p>「啊呀！啊呀！」雷辟克家的呌着，呌得大家都戰慄起來。</p>
<p>「快一點，爸爸！」姐兒愛勒絲丁說。</p>
<p>「你忍住　一下啦！」大哥菲利克斯對他的母親說。</p>
<p>雷辟克失了耐心。刀子切開了肉，亂鋸着，雷辟克家的在輕輕念着「劊子手！劊子手！」之後，幸而暈過去了。</p>
<p>雷辟克便趁着機會做下去。他臉色雪白，發了瘋似的，割着，在肉裏面搜尋着，那指頭便好啦！</p>
<p>當大家給雷辟克家的弄去釣鈎的時候，紅蘿蔔鬚是没有盡一點力的。他聽到他母親發出第一個呌聲時，便逃走了。他坐在樓梯上，兩手抱着頭，在推究發生這意外之事的原因。無疑的，一定是當他把釣竿往遠處揮去時，釣鈎留在他的背上了。</p>
<p>「我現在才知道後來爲什麽釣不着魚了！」他說。他聽着他母親歎息，起初是毫不覺得難過的。等一會兒不是要輪着他像她一樣的呌着，並且盡其可能的呌着，直呌到力竭聲嘶，好讓她早點覺行已經夠報復了，因而饒了他嗎？</p>
<p>一些聽着呌聲跑來的鄰居問他道；</p>
<p>「究竟有仁麽事情，紅蘿蔔鬚？」</p>
<p>他什麽話也不回答；他把耳朶掩住，他那赭色的腦袋消失不見了。鄰居們排立在樓梯，面，等着聽新聞。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的終於走出來了。她像剛生了小孩的女人一樣蒼白，她像是經過了一個大危險似的，頗有幾分驕傲，把她那細心包紮的手指舉在前。她戰勝了餘痛。她對那些跑來看她的鄰人微笑着，講了幾句話使他們放心，她又温柔地對紅蘿蔔鬚說道；</p>
<p>「你把我弄傷啦，我的乖寳啊！我並不怪你的；這不是你的過錯。」</p>
<p>她從來没有用這樣的聲調對紅蘿蔔鬚說過話。他吃了一驚，把頭抬起。他看見他母親的手指用布和綫包紥着，乾乾凈凈的，粗而且方的，恰像一個窮孩子頑的囝囝。他那雙乾燥的眼睛頓時充滿了涙水。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的　下身子。像平常一樣把肘放在前面。可是很大量地，當着衆人抱吻了他。　　他莫明其妙了。他涕泗滂沱的哭着。</p>
<p>「人家旣然已經對你說這事已經過去了，我原宥你了，你還哭什麽！你以爲眞是那樣凶」</p>
<p>惡嗎？」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚鳴咽得更利害。</p>
<p>「這不是蠢嗎？人家一定說有人扼着他的喉嚨啦。」雷辟克家的對那些爲她的仁愛所感動的隣人們說。</p>
<p>她把那釣鈎遞給他們，讓他們好奇地審視着。其中有一個人斷言這是第八號釣鈎。慢慢地，她又口若懸河起來，他以如簧的巧舌把那悲劇述給他們聽了。（未完）</p>

<p>新近美福有一位新聞界名人何懷德氏來華，考察中國各種現狀與新聞事業的情形，本埠各界令袖及日報公會均曾公宴招待，竭誠歡迎。日前記者聽到一位曾與何氏（以下簡稱何氏）談過話的朋友說，何氏爲美國各大報兼聯合新聞社的總董，平素對於我國情形極爲熟悉，有一次何氏在某歡宴席上與某公暢談東三省的過去與將來氰　形時，何氏曾提出這樣一個深刻而使我們聽了痛心疾首的問題，就是；「···假如日本忽與中國眞正的實行親善政策，將東」</p>
<p>三省及熱河完全交還中國，我們試推測一下，中國究將派何人去接受與管理這四省的大地？」我們應當知道何氏提出這個問題的背景，是表明他是知道在過去張學良治理下的東三省是怎樣，在湯玉麟治理下的熱河又是怎樣。或者有人要反駁說，若何氏果有如此的意思，那麽照目前全國各省的政治不修明的情形看來，豈非都有請外人來治理的必要嗎？但同時我們也可以說，中國今日的政治紊亂，大半是由於列强帝國資本主義者所造成的，在這種半殖民地的情勢環境下，遂產生了政治的局面割據，農村的經濟破產，工業的生產的幼稚種種現象。所以我們若要創立民族的新生命，建樹政治上軌道的新國家，必得先打破這種半殖民地的環境，淸除一切壓迫中國的政治經濟的國際力量。</p>
<p>以上對中國問題的兩種中外不同的觀察，我們若以純客觀非感情的態度來批評，覺得實亦各有是處，因爲後者的議論是從整個中國的政治經濟的情勢上面出發的，而何懷德氏的問題所給予我們的敎訓，乃是從九一八事變後今年熱河又失守以來，我們全國政府領袖們所表現的抗日决心如何，修明内政的事實又在那裏。我們不必怨恨外人的嘲笑，我們應注意國難以來，政府與人民所表現的種種苟且偷安的心理，在過去平津危急，兵臨城下的時日，政府所表示的種種手忙脚亂與夫事前無準備，臨時無决心的事實。倘若今日的政府與國人有志於打破目前國家所處的半殖民地的地位，消除壓近中國政治經濟的一切國際力量，那末，試問我們從什麽地方可以看出政府有這種準備的事實表現？我們又從什麽地方可以看出國人有這種决心的精神呢？</p>
<p>無準備，無决心，國難前途，安有止境！</p>

<p>— 韋依光</p>
<p>（海員）中國海員工人多數來自山東，天津，上海，寗波，福州，廣州，瓊崖，汕頭等處，按照輪船中的工作，可分爲生火，水手，船尾，较房四種。因爲言語不通的緣故，他們中間的地方觀念都很深，而使彼此的感情不相聯絡，同時，海員工人若爲水手工，則不能爲生火，爲生火工，則不能爲船尾如辦房，而「涉媽沙」們便利用這種機會，來分拆離間各地海員工人的感情，致海員工人不能團結一致，只得俯首貼耳。一任他們剝削和壓迫。</p>
<p>船中的工頭是與「涉媽沙」共同剝削海員工人的人物。因爲每家輪船公司都有「涉媽沙」，一般的頭目們當然是要利用金錢向「涉媽沙」們活動，才能獲得項頭目工作，而「涉媽沙」們便利用種種的手段，使一班頭目互相逐鹿，誰化茶資多，誰便得到這項工作。至於運用金錢的多少是以船長隻的大小和利益的多少爲標準的。頭目得到了船上的一項工作，他便去找一班海員工人來做工。一切的一切當然是由他來支配，因爲他們是施行包工制的。他找到那個海員工人勞力代價低廉，便呌那個去做工。例如每人月薪爲三十元，則頭目即先對他們說；「第一個月的薪水是没有的，或僅發給幾塊錢的，你們願意做不願意做呢？而且現在已有某某等都願意做三兩個月不拿薪水的工作呢！」有時遇有走漏私貨的生意，多是交給海員工人去做，去頂死，一旦發生拿捕的事件，其罪責當然是歸到海員工人的身上，而海員工人因爲生活所迫，也祗得做這種明知故犯的勾當。</p>
<p>這般頭目，買辦以及高級職員們，在船中經常的備有鴉片烟燈，番攤，牌九，麻雀，撲克，紙牌，等等，一方面困然是爲搭客而設，但一方面是要引誘海員工人進入陷阱，使他們得從中抽頭而坐享其利。鴉片烟燈是他們所專賣的，他們引誘海員工人吸烟，以吸收其血汗之資，使其金錢到手輒盡而逼得向他們借債，這種債欵的利息，每月每元有多至一角至兩角的。</p>
<p>海員工人的工作時間，每日至少在十小時以上。本來，像生火水手所做的苦工作，每日至多做五個鐘頭便夠了，可是，對於這一點，資本家和買辦是不會想到的，他們只要有錢賺就是了。而且，海員工人動不動便要受買辦，大副，二副及大車，二車，頭目的打駡，任他們怎樣的發脾氣，海員工人都要含着眼淚來强作笑答的啊！</p>
<p>至於海員工人在船上的衣食住，那更是不堪聞問。他們住的不過是一丈闊的房子，每間要容納到七八人以至十餘人，且是在最熱和最不淸潔的近厠所和生火的地方，他們所穿的衣服鞋帽，本應歸公司方面担負，但是因爲頭目和「涉媽沙」要結資本家的歡心，他們便把海員工人一切的衣着和肥皂都移歸海員工人自理。同時，海員工人的伙食，也是爲頭目所包辦，名義上每月伙食費普通是十元至十二元，但所吃的東西却又是等於狗猪所吃的一樣。</p>
<p>最後，要談到船上的衛生方面。本來，船上是應該講衛生的，可是，船上所有的醫生們，完全是爲大車，二車，大副，二副，船主及幾位高等職員和高等搭客而聘用的。若是海員工人有了疾病，却仍要做工不得休息。如果患有傳染病到危險的時候，當然是不能起身工作了，於是有些良心發現的頭目便暗地裏拿些藥石來救濟；若告訴醫生知道，那麽，這一條狗命就馬上被送入海裏去了。因爲船上的醫生最怕的是傳染病，他們若知道工人患有傳染病，馬上就會用了電或毒藥來把他害死而投諸海中，免致傳染船上其餘的人，這就是船上的衛生哩！</p>

<p>㈠招商局我由一位親戚介紹而爲招商局船上買辦。船至洋中，風浪大作，船身萬分簸盪，我即嘔吐交作，不勝其苦。那時我纔覺得船上生涯是辛苦的。我念及我是富家的嬌養兒，衣食舒服，到這裏來豈非自討苦吃？旣而幡然覺悟，以爲人生於世，當努力奮鬥圖存。以此自勉，乃爲買辦，計有十八年之久，　　㈡東方匯利銀行當我任匯利銀行買辦時，姪兒雲望來學買辦，無所事事。於是我對他說；以若所爲，求若所欲，猶緣木而求魚也。他被我責駡了一頓，便不再來。後來他也就考入海關服務。他喜歡研究理化，備有許多儀器。一天，他邀我和稅務司至其家午膳，席間他試陰陽二電，發出雷電。稅務司見而奇之。遂把他擢升爲化騐師。直做到現在。　　㈢求新廠我在三十餘年前，同家舅相伯，遊歷海外，鑒於歐美各國實業發達，乃决意振興中國實業，遂開求新廠，外國所有的機器，我都願造。像搖襪機，從外國來的，每部要賣二百餘兩，但我自己所製造的每部祇售二十五元，就售去二三千部之多！</p>
<p>㈣江南造船廠後來我受友人这聘，兼任江南船廠經理。第一個月就發了幾千塊錢的工資，這使我吃了一驚，然同時亦張了我的膽。所以當時我益擴大求新廠，又得了袁大總統的擔保，信用卓著，生意便更興隆了。</p>
<p>㈤立德油廠用大豆壓榨，豆上覆以餅布，榨出來的流質就是豆油。講到餅布，質料很堅，從國外來的，每張要賣到四五兩。我嫌其貴，想自做，就打電報到國外，買做餅布之機。回電說，此機須售幾萬兩。我因其價太貴，乃以地毯代之，可是，唉，油還没有榨出，毯却已經破了。後來我想得一法，雇三工人，拿麻皮組成麻線，呌他們像織馬肚帶般織成麻布，把牠當作餅布用，無異外貨。唉，想不到値價幾萬兩的機器居然可以由人工來代替，你想奇怪不奇怪！　　㈥大通與合衆大通仁記航業公司有輪船四隻，專航通揚班。中國合衆航業公司，創辦至今，不過四五年，現已有輪三艘，專航海州。這兩家公司初創時，僅各有基金二十萬元，因營業發達，現已各有幾百萬元的資本了。</p>

<p>— 立</p>
<p>爲了中國在閙麥荒，所以這次財宋在美國，就向美國財政美國財政善後銀公司簽字借了美金五千萬元（約合華幣二萬萬餘元），其中五分之四是買棉的丨丨丨當然也因棉在閙荒，其餘的是作買麥之用。據說，這對於雙方均有利益；美國市塲的剩餘，旣可推銷，又可奬勵中國人使用美國的棉麥，而同時，中國經濟也可重行活動，於恢復世界經濟，實有裨益。</p>
<p>且讓我們單從麥一方面來看看雙方的利益吧！</p>
<p>這一交易，對於美帝國主義當然是很有利的，因爲牠正可把自己國家内的生產過剩的麥運到中國來實施傾銷，而且還有五厘的利息呢！</p>
<p>對於半殖民地的中國呢？由於帝；國主義的經濟侵略，一方面使中國的農業生產加速的商品化，使農村中所需要的日常用品愈須仰給於充滿着舶來品的市塲，另一方面，又破壞了農村中的家庭手工業，使牠與農業脫離而逐漸成爲獨立的生產部門。前者增加了農民底支出，後者却减少了他底收入，因此農民是很容易受到飢餓底威脅，而苛捐雜稅，軍閥，貪官，污吏，奸商以及封建地主對於農民的剝削，和以各帝國主義者相互間的衝突爲背景的中國軍閥的戰爭，與生產力的衝突的必然結果。所以，今年雖是豐收的年代，然而結果却是豐收成災，穀賤傷農丨丨因爲穀價賤，即使農民把所收穫的穀全部賣去，所得的也還不夠補償農民所負底債務，一切苛捐雜稅以及田租等。如果再以美麥來「救濟」，自然使中國自己出產的麥價更跌，結果是更加速了農村經濟破產的過程。</p>
<p>其次。這一筆借欵，是如八日本報本埠增和刋的賡君所說；「債上加債，利中生利，尙未出娘腹的乃子乃孫。亦將不得不預先接下替人白做牛馬的定銀了。」</p>
<p>還有是這次的中美借欵，又暴露了各帝國主義爲爭奪市塲血起的衝突，倫敦泰晤士報　中美新借欵云；「其結果將增加英之報有中國債　者之不　。」（見十三日本報）</p>

<p>（賣身契）ＸＸ女士到了上海，才知道做工丨尤其是在紗廠或絲廠裏做工丨的生活比鄉下的牛馬遠不如。可是在這年頭，像我這樣能夠得到一種牛馬生活的已經算是　幸了。回顧在　　　　　　故鄉的兄弟姊妹們，他們竟連要過牛馬生活而不可得，該是如何的苦痛，如何的不幸啊！</p>
<p>因爲要求得這一種比牛馬還不如的工作，我底父親不知道向ＸＸ伯說了多少好話，又送了兩隻鷄，他才答應把我介紹到這裏來。當我臨走的那天，ＸＸ伯借給父親三十塊錢；要他寫了這麽一張契約；</p>
<p>「立自願書人ＸＸ情因當年家中困難，今　小女ＸＸ自包與招工員ＸＸＸ名下帶至上海紗廠工作。憑中言明包得大洋三十元正，以三年滿期，此欵按每年三月間付洋十元。自進廠之後，聽憑招工員敎訓，不得有違。倘有走失拐帶，天年不測，均歸出筆人承認，與招工員無涉。如有頭痛傷風，歸招工員負責。三年期内，該女添補衣服，歸招工員承認。倘有停工，如數照補。期限ＸＸ年Ｘ月Ｘ日滿工。滿工後當報效招工員　月。恐後　憑　　　　　　」</p>
<p>從這麽一張　　上看過去，那末我</p>

<p>現在的生活情形自然可想而知了！我是没有一切的自由。我的工錢，我的工作，甚至我這個人，都非我自己所有。</p>
<p>爲了要求得牛馬的工作，我和我底父親又不得不「自願」寫上這麽一張賣身契了。</p>

<p>— 翼</p>
<p>研究唯物論的社會學者，姑且不去談他，就是知道迎合時代潮流的時髦文人，也在改變作風，刻意去描寫勞動羣衆的生活，替他們喊寃訴苦；但是，宛轉吟呻於資本主義社會下的，又豈止這一羣賣力的勞動者呢？</p>
<p>舊式商店的小夥計，早上五六點鐘便須起床，掃地，下店門板；應付買客，一直要到街頭的人跡不見，老板娘睡得不亦绵乎時，纔得關起門來去睡覺，有時一天三頓飯須丢下七八回碗筷去應付主顧，但是，他們一年所得的代價，充其量也不過百金而已。然而他們只好歸罪於宿命」，有誰能注意到他們也同樣的在過着奴隸生活，和曾經判處無期徒刑的囚犯並没有兩樣呢？</p>
<p>此外如工廠裏和大商塲裏的小職員和小店員，就表面看去，長衫，鞋，襪，色色俱備；他們的操作也不過是；寫字，記賬，打算盤，開發票之類，和勞力者相較，似乎要輕便寫意得多。但他們的鞋，襪，長衫是不能不穿的，尤其是不能穿得蹩脚，否則人家就要說他們有碍於雇主方面的觀瞻了。他們是　樣要住房子的，他們同樣有老母，妻子，各兒　女要養；但是，他們鎭日價替企業家做着刻板式的工作，所取得的代價又有幾何呢？就上海而論，普通戰員或店員，最多的月薪亦不過三十元左右，少則七八元不等，以生活程度高過一切的上海，又怎樣去維持他們一家的生活？他們所担任的職務，經理，廠長都能夠担任的，而且同樣的人才在羡慕着候缺的正不知有多少。他們究竟不是技術家，不算什麽希奇，倘　有了一點錯處，廠方或店方，馬上就可以呌他們捲舖蓋，回家去喝西北風的。他們没有組織什麽團體，他們更得不到絲毫的援助，飯碗是一點兒也没有保障的。總之，他們所　受的痛苦，正像啞子吃黃連，又有那個時髦文人做過一篇文字，替他們鳴不平呢？</p>

<h3 id="c247">心病療養院揩油之社會學的考察 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>揩油在上海已經成了一般的現象，到處可以看到揩油的事實，尤其是在電車上，售票員的揩油好像是他經常的工作，凡是坐電車的人，没有不親眼看到他揩渍的。而所謂售票員，也以爲他們的工資低少，不夠生活，非楷油不足以資維持。換言之，揩油在他們看來，已是成爲改善生活獨一無二的法門。這種事實，也除非是站在資本家利益方面的人，說是不道德的，應該嚴加取締。其他一些同情於售票員的人，都說這是正當的，應該揩的，何况揩的又是外國人或資本家的油。我們時常可以聽到這種說法。但是若照社會學的考察。這些人也只算是看到事情的表面，而没有深究到它的内在。這就是說，揩油究竟對於整個的勞動者方面，是有利的抑是有害的，他們是不得而知的。</p>
<p>在現社會中，無疑的，勞動者是處在被壓迫與剝削的地位，終日出賣其勞動力，尙不能得一飽，而另一方面，却有不勞而獲的資本家，坐以榨取勞動者的剩餘價値，終日過那驕奢淫侈的生活，因之人類的不平與貧者愈貧富者愈富的現象，也就根源於此，成爲一切罪惡的淵藪了！但歷史告訴我們，跟着這種現象的深刻化，喚起了勞動者的覺醒，他們怠識到無論爲自己的生存或是整個勞動者的利益，都有鬥爭的必要，也惟有鬥爭才是他們的出路。於是鬥爭就經常活躍在他們二者之間。然而鬥爭在平時，多出自各别的產業部門或特殊的職業組織之内。譬如過去水電罷工，郵務罷工，紗廠罷工等都是發自單一的組織内。同時也以各别的或特殊的利益爲仍依歸。所以他們鬥爭的時候，其範圍常是狹隘的，非廣大的。這就是他們只知道從事於同一職業的勞動者的利益是共同的，和應該團結起來爭求這共同的利益。但事實擺在我們面前，這種鬥爭很少有勝利的可能，常是本身受到失敗的敎訓，就退一步說，所爭得的利益也是很且要加緊這種鬥爭，進一步的去爭得最後的勝利。不過這種鬥爭，不是只着重於特殊職業的勞動者之利益，而是要顧全整個勞動者的利益。須知整個勞動者的利益才是他們各人眞正的利益，必須團結整個的勞動者來與利益相反的資本家相對抗，才能保持旣得的利益或爭得新的利益。至於其他一切取巧的方法，那更，勞動者所不應該採取的。</p>
<p>明乎此，揩油對於勞動者的利害，也就不難明白。嚴格說來，揩油毫没有改善生活的意義，只不過是逃避現實的一種取巧的方法，足以减低鬥爭的情緒，模糊鬥爭的意識，轉移鬥爭的目標，使他們放棄爲整個勞動者的利益鬥爭的任務，而只顧全到目前這種不正當利益的取得，何况揩油的本身就是帶有冒險性的，一經查票員發　，就有罰錢或開除的危險。即使僥倖能相安無事的過去，他只不過得到一點「外快」，就値得這樣傾全力去注重它，其至認它是改善生活的獨一無二的法門嗎？没有顧全到整個勞動者利益的各别的鬥爭，尙且得不到君　的利益，那末，這種逃避現實的取巧舉動，當然更不會對於整個勞動者有利，而是十足有害的。</p>

<p>— 逸中</p>
<p>（茅屋）石灰窰在渦去是製造石灰的場所，到現在已經是都市矛盾的又一表現處。　是位置在四面巍峨的工廠中間，一脚踏出勞勃生路英華里的圍牆，就是石灰窰的地界。在這裏是没有一間瓦房，有的只是草篷。我走進石灰窰第一種給我的印象是一家雜貨舖，這舖子裏最多的貨品是迷信用的香燭紙馬。從這一點我們可以曉得迷信在貧民隊裏的深刻，但那也是他們的生活使他們如此的。他們常要遇到失業和疾病的　擊，没有人去解救他們，而他們自己也没有辦法爲自己謀出路。那自然只好向冥冥中的「神」去求救了。</p>
<p>我從這舖子的北面望去，可以看到一片大荒場，在這荒塲上零零落落的點綴着新的棺木和一包包的東西，有許多是用稻草包的，有許多是用破棉被或包糖的蒲包包的，其所包着的都是死孩。他們不幸生爲窮苦人家的孩子，他們的父母終日爲生活而奮鬥，但仍得不到一個温飽，當然，這許多的小孩子是不會有飽暖的時候的。在飢寒交迫失時候，他們常被關在雨打風吹的茅屋裏，任你怎樣的啼哭，他們的父母爲了生活在老遠老遠的地方出賣他們的勞力，雖然他們愛子女的心一點也不會比富人差一些，但他們除掉在想着時　　一下外，也只有　口氣來表示他們内心的苦痛。這許多小孩生了病！不但没有錢請醫生吃藥，而且也没有好好的看護他們。他們的父母除了向他們的子女　些傷心的淚以外，那只有眼看着他們心愛的子女冷！僵！死！没有錢去買棺木，那只得用稻草包一包向荒場上一抛了事。在這樣的貧民窟裏，不必說，小孩子死亡率是特别的高，每隔幾天普善山莊到荒場來收拾一次，每次都可以收到許多！</p>
<p>我再從這舖子的西向望去，是一條大路！丨泥土大路，兩旁列着許多的草房，其屋薝和我的肩相平，因爲這條泥土大路高出兩旁的地面有兩三尺之多。我走到一家門口，看見一個老翁坐着，我就走下這路去向他打了一個招呼，並作下列的問答；</p>
<p>問；老公公，你住在些地多少年了？</p>
<p>答；五六年。</p>
<p>問；要出房錢麽？</p>
<p>答；房錢是不出的，因爲這草房是我們自己蓋的，可是這地皮要出租錢十五塊錢一年，還有篷房捐和同鄉大享的節規，一年也得化二十多塊錢。</p>
<p>問；這條路比屋裏地面高，下雨不會有水流進來麽？</p>
<p>答；有的，所以我們的門檻築得特别高。小雨是一些也不妨事的，可是，到大雨的時候，那不但前面流水進來，屋上也得流下來。所以一下大雨，我們連飯都煑不成，只有大哭小啼的聲音。還有，養的猪睛天在外邊跑來跑去，一下雨也鑽到屋子裏來，臥在人睡的舖底下，那時才難聞一種臭氣哩！</p>
<p>問；你們每天吃幾餐呢？</p>
<p>答；没有一定的，有時吃三餐，有時兩餐一餐，或者大家一天吃一次粥就算，我們只要不餓死就夠了。</p>

<p>丨Reportedly, the Central Government Also Telegraphed Approval丨</p>
<p>Removal of Wu Yong's Acting Chairman Order for Chahar Province</p>
<p>Ordering Song Zheyuan to Return to Chahar to Handle the Aftermath</p>
<p>He and Huang Telegraphing to the Central Government to Appoint Feng as the Forest and Land Reclamation Director-General</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Political Reorganization Committee was formally established at 9:00 AM this morning. Huang Fu, Han Fuqu, Yu Xuezhong, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Song Zheyuan, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, Liu Zhe, Zhang Zhitian, Wang Yitang, Tang Erhe, and Wang Shuhan, and Lu Dangping, fourteen people attended. He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Gao Lingbo, Wang Shuchang, etc. were also present. After Huang Fu's speech, the first plenary meeting was held with the same attendees. The meeting resolved: 1. Accept Feng's seven opinions. 2. Revoke Wu Yong's acting chairman order for Chahar Province. 3. Order Song to return to Chahar to reorganize Chahar's administration. 4. He Yingqin and Huang Fu will telegraph to the Central Government, suggesting that Feng be appointed as the Forest and Land Reclamation Director-General. It is said that the title for Fang Zhenwu has not yet been decided, possibly as Deputy Director-General for Forest and Land Reclamation. As for the disposal of the puppet troops, He and Huang will continue to be responsible for negotiating with the Japanese in Beiping. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities have completely agreed to Feng's proposed post-war arrangements for the military in Chahar Province. However, Fang Zhenwu's military title is yet to be determined, but this does not hinder Song's return to Chahar. The Military Council and the Political Reorganization Committee are scheduled to issue orders separately today, ordering Song to return to Chahar immediately. The Military Council orders Song to lead his troops back to their original defense positions in Chahar to consolidate the defense perimeter. The Political Council orders Song to resume his original position as Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government. Song is scheduled to leave Beiping for Chahar within two or three days, and his troops will gradually move west. Song will first send Zhang Jiyong, along with Huang Fu's representative Yuan Liang and someone else, to Chahar today or tomorrow to explain the details of the decisions to Feng. The negotiation phase of the Chahar incident has come to an end, and the second phase of implementation can begin. The internal worries in North China can be temporarily eliminated. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin and Huang Fu have largely accepted the opinions put forward by Feng Yuxiang. Reportedly, the Central Government has also telegraphed its approval. Within days, the Military Council and the Political Reorganization Committee will simultaneously issue orders, directing Song Zheyuan to return to Chahar. He and Huang are now planning to send Yuan Liang and Zhang Jiyong to Zhangjiakou within days to discuss the handling of Chahar affairs in detail with Feng. In general, everything is as previously discussed. Feng will be the Forest and Land Reclamation Director-General, Sun Dianying will be the Qinghai Land Reclamation Director-General, and Fang Zhenwu will be the Chahar Garrison Commander or Civil Affairs Commissioner. All departments under them will be reorganized by Song according to Feng's opinions. Feng himself will not leave Chahar for the time being. Sun will go to Qinghai when the order is issued. Song has also indicated that he will return to his post within days. The future of the Chahar affair should not have any more setbacks. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The full text of Huang Fu's speech at the Political Reorganization Committee on the 17th is as follows: For six years, Fu has lived in seclusion, living a simple life, and had no intention of asking about the world. However, as the national crisis worsened and internal and external troubles increased, witnessing the difficulties, it was difficult to sleep or eat in peace, so he reluctantly accepted the orders of the Central Government and traveled here in a hurry. He hopes to make efforts for the country and the people. Success or failure, praise or blame, are not what he thinks about. When he went north, he happened to encounter shocks in Beiping and Tianjin, rumors abounded, unrest was prevalent, and refugees were everywhere. The situation was complicated and perilous. Fu, with his limited talent, bears this heavy responsibility, considering and planning day and night, thinking that the most important thing at present is to stabilize people's hearts and protect the territory. The second is to restore normalcy in the war zone, and try to settle the refugees. Only then will the municipal administration of the northern provinces have the opportunity to gradually reorganize. With this goal in mind, he has been working hard to relieve the people's suffering and bring the administration back to the right track. Now that the military operations in the front are about to end, there are many complicated aspects of the plan for reorganizing political affairs in the north, as well as the steps to be implemented in the future, which cannot be accomplished by one person alone. He will report to the Central Government at any time, consult with local officials, and widely solicit the opinions of the people, in order to adapt to the environment and facilitate implementation. The so-called governance does not lie in many words, Fu has always used this to encourage himself. Moreover, Fu has something more to say, the rise and fall of a country, its formation is extremely complex, but the beginning really starts with oneself, so for all the past, everyone must have a sense of responsibility, and for all the future, we must share the ambition of self-improvement. As for the responsibilities of this committee, we should fulfill our duties, and promptly respond to opportunities. We dare not seek complacency, nor dare we act hastily and ruin things. The wise and discerning people in the country understand this purpose, and hope that we will learn from the past and not forget the alliance of being in Ju, unite our efforts, and be vigilant about the danger of an overturned nest, so that foreign aggression can be gradually contained and the country can be revived. This is what Fu uses to encourage himself and what he wants to encourage his colleagues to do together. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this committee, he presents what he has in mind, and hopes for understanding. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Today's "Izvestia" newspaper, in its editorial commenting on the situation in North China, stated: "If the Kuomintang is deeply convinced that the United States is unwilling and unable to help them resist Japan, and can only openly surrender, then the Japanese military will abandon its plan to create an independent state in North China. But if the Kuomintang is still afraid that open surrender will cause its own collapse, and is unwilling to be a puppet of Japanese rule in China, then the Japanese military will definitely launch various independence movements." The Soviet government gazette also stated that the Japanese Empire is unwilling to reveal even slightly its true intention to annex not only Manchuria but also North China, because the British Empire's economic interests in North China are extremely large. The newspaper pointed out that Feng Yuxiang is one of the focuses of the creative ability displayed by the Japanese military in guaranteeing the independence movement in North China, and said that the ruling power that Feng can rely on to re-emerge will be embodied as an agent of the interests of Japanese imperialists, because Japan wants to use Feng to create an independent situation in North China and to create soldiers for the establishment of Mongolia. The newspaper continued, "Both Nanjing and Shanghai deeply understand that Feng is being used to oppose them, so when they report to Feng's future commander-in-chief, they always say that Feng originally colluded with the Soviet Union, but the myth of Soviet aid to Feng created in Shanghai is ridiculous, because the Soviet Union will never participate in the division of North China and the dangerous actions in Mongolia." The newspaper concluded by saying that the reports about the Soviet Union transporting military supplies and communist propaganda teams directly to Zhangjiakou from the Kuren Avenue are as unreal as a mirage, "because it is unknown whether the gentleman who wrote this report left his Shanghai and Beiping hotels when drafting it."

<h3 id="e11">Our Country's Diplomatic Situation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that after the loss of Jehol, our country's diplomacy was greatly affected for a time. However, in the past two months, international relations have become increasingly serious due to the aggressive policies adopted by Japan. World peace is in great danger of being destroyed due to the issue of the three northeastern provinces. To this day, people from all walks of life in various countries have become increasingly aware of the need to take unified action against the violent Japan. However, after Hitler came to power in Germany, the political situation in Europe felt uneasy, especially in France. Therefore, at that time, the governments of Britain, France, and Italy all regarded stabilizing the European situation as the top priority and could not take care of the Far East issue. At the same time, a major financial turmoil occurred in the United States, and domestic problems urgently needed to be resolved, so they could not take care of the Sino-Japanese incident. As for the Soviet Union, because it was busy with its own construction work, it did not want to oppose Japan. Under this situation, our country's diplomatic activities felt quite difficult. However, in the past month or so, the European political situation has been guaranteed to a considerable extent due to the signing of the Four-Power Pact through the efforts of British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The American financial turmoil has passed safely, and the White House economic talks have also obtained the preliminary understanding of the heads of various countries. The situation of European and American cooperation has been formed, and the Sino-Japanese issue has gradually received the attention of various countries. At the same time, through the activities of our country's diplomatic representatives, various countries have become more aware of our position and attitude. The Japanese representatives, whether in terms of military or economic aspects, have based their actions on force and self-interest, and have put forward various absurd demands, which have aroused international disgust. Therefore, our diplomatic situation has improved again. Recently, the United States lent cotton and wheat to our country, which is a manifestation of its sincerity in helping our country. This kind of economic chain will definitely promote further cooperation among various countries. Song's attendance at the London Economic Conference was highly praised by the authorities of various European countries. European newspapers have also given good reviews to our country's hard work, patience, and efforts to cope with the national crisis, and some have advocated using economic power to assist our country's internal construction. This change in international public opinion is very beneficial to our country's diplomacy, and the country's future may gradually enter a better state. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) After the memorandum of Dr. Alfred Hugenberg, the chief German delegate to the World Economic Conference, regarding German colonial claims, attracted attention at the conference, the German delegation informed the chairman of the Economic and Trade Committee, Colijn, this afternoon that the memorandum did not represent the views of the German delegation, but only the personal opinions of Dr. Hugenberg. It has been learned that the memorandum stated that Russian and Eastern European lands should be used as places for German people to migrate to, and the Russian representative Litvinov has denounced it as nonsense, and the major powers have also ridiculed it. It is now learned that Hugenberg's memorandum has been withdrawn. (Seventeenth National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The most important development in today's Economic Conference was the serious incident that occurred in German-Russian relations. The memorandum submitted by the German chief delegate Hugenberg proposing the return of colonies contained the statement that wars, revolutions, and domestic disintegration all originated in Soviet Russia and that this kind of behavior is still in progress and must be stopped. The Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov therefore considered it a slander against Soviet Russia. The chairman of the Economic Committee, Colijn, put great pressure on Hugenberg, urging him to withdraw it voluntarily, but Hugenberg refused. Colijn then refused to accept it on the grounds that the issue was not within the scope of the agenda and destroyed all printed copies. However, Litvinov was still indignant and issued a statement to the newspapers denouncing Hugenberg's slander of the Soviet government, saying that the German government's move only made itself a laughingstock in the world. He also told the Moscow Pravda correspondent that he saw an intention in the German memorandum for Germany to expand eastward. Then there was an even more shocking message: the German delegation suddenly issued a semi-official statement stating that the memorandum was Hugenberg's personal opinion and not an official document of the delegation. It is now heard that Hugenberg has returned to Berlin tonight. Although rumors that it was due to a recall by the German government have been denied, it is also admitted that Hugenberg may no longer attend the conference. There are also rumors here that Hugenberg may resign as Minister of Commerce and Agriculture and be replaced by the Economic Undersecretary, Pungglai Ying, as the representative to the Economic Conference. (Seventeenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the German withdrawal of the memorandum, the news is conflicting. The matter caused quite a stir in the Economic Conference lounge. The actual course of events can be roughly inferred as follows: This morning, the Economic Conference Secretariat received the German memorandum, which was originally fully responsible by the German government. Later, due to the excitement in the conference hall, the German delegation stopped distributing the memorandum and explained that it was Hugenberg's personal opinion and that he would submit it to the Economic Committee. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The German representatives made another surprising move today, formally proposing in the Economic Committee the return of African colonies, claiming that this would greatly help Germany repay its international debts, as a reason for the return. This proposal by the Germans was attached to the end of the submitted memorandum on the causes and remedies of the world economic recession. The entire memorandum was eighteen pages long and was submitted by the chief delegate Hugenberg. Recently, the political relationship between Hugenberg and Prime Minister Hitler has been very tense, so the delegates generally expected the German representatives to only participate in discussions on economic currency and may not raise important political issues. Unexpectedly, there was a request to revise the treaty in the speech a few days ago, and today there is a proposal to return the colonies. According to Hugenberg's statement to the committee, this proposal was fully endorsed by Prime Minister Hitler, which shows that the tension between Hugenberg and Hitler has eased slightly, and all German political parties can consolidate and unite to support this movement. However, whether the Germans want Cameroon and Togoland, which cover an area of ​​approximately 500,000 square miles and are self-sufficient, or the former German territories that have now been incorporated into the South African Federation, is not mentioned in the memorandum. The German delegates also did not want to specify where, and will let the Economic Committee consider it themselves. The memorandum only stated that if the countries can return the colonies, Germany's ability to repay debts will increase, because Germany urgently needs a place to migrate, and returning the colonies seems to be the most practical and feasible way to save the economic recession. As for the fact that the location is not specified in the memorandum, the intention is to hope that the countries will formally inquire about where is most suitable for Germany's needs, and then answer accordingly, because this move is purely a proposal and does not have the slightest request. Most representatives believe that this move only opens a way for discussion. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Germany's request to the Economic Conference to reclaim the colonies lost after the war, regarding this matter, the memorandum was signed by the German Minister of Economy, Hugenberg. At the beginning, it quoted the saying "The Decline of the West" from the book written by the famous German writer Spengler. The German memorandum stated, "The actions of inferior humans are gradually developing in the West, and we must not be destroyed by this kind of humans. If Germany collapses, then the other Western countries will also collapse sooner or later. If you want to save the world, you must start by saving Germany. There are two ways to do this: one is for the Western countries to restore Germany's ability to pay outwards, but to do so, Germany's former colonies in Africa must be returned to Germany, so that it can undertake huge projects and develop resources; the other is for Western nations with perseverance, outstanding and creative abilities, because their territory is small and cannot be developed, they must be given colonies, so that they can engage in construction to benefit peace. As for Russia, Germany, and most of the East, they are now continuing to engage in destructive work, and we must have a way to stop it," etc. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The German delegation has just submitted a memorandum to the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference, requesting the return of the former African colonies of Germany to Germany. People in the Economic Committee were extremely shocked when they heard the news. They all said that Germany, in view of the fact that the International Mandates Commission of the League of Nations is about to meet, specially raised this issue to the Economic Conference, as a pre-emptive measure. The political circles were extremely surprised by Germany's dramatic proposal. The Soviet Union said that Germany's request to reclaim the colonies this time corresponded to the previous visit to England by Rosenberg, a confidant of the German National Socialist Party leader and Prime Minister Hitler. When Rosenberg went to England, it was rumored that Rosenberg suggested to the general manager of Royal Dutch Shell, Totten, to jointly deal with the Soviet Union (because Soviet oil competes with Royal Dutch Shell oil). The purpose of the German memorandum to the Economic Committee this time, based on the previous incident, is suspected to be to organize an anti-communist crusade with the UK in exchange for reclaiming African colonies. This move by Germany is beyond the expectations of ordinary people. The Soviet Union believes that this proposal will be opposed by global public opinion, so they despise it with a serious attitude. British people are deeply concerned that Germany's request will affect the progress of the Economic Conference. Financial circles believe that Germany's actions this time are detrimental to the previous claims made by the country, and the political nature of Germany's request to reclaim the colonies is so obvious that it is doubtful whether the Economic Conference can accept it. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, all newspapers have reported the conversation between the Minister of Economy, Hugenberg, and newspaper reporters in London regarding the issue of returning German colonies. Hugenberg first stated that the debt of the debtor country can only be repaid with goods, and it must be after the national economy and finance are prosperous. Hugenberg then stated that according to the observations of German people, if Germany wants to restore its economically strong position, there are only two ways: one is that the German pre-war colonies in Africa should be returned to Germany, so that Germany can take part in the work of constructing Africa; the other is to open up a new area for Germany, as a place for the surplus population of Germany to reside. Hugenberg finally said that the saying that the world has overproduction is actually unfounded, because the world's disease today is not due to overproduction, but due to the reduction of purchasing power, which causes the disease of stagnation in sales.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from the Japanese delegation in London last night, saying that the German delegation submitted a memorandum to the United Nations entitled "Causes of the World Depression and the War Debt Problem," in which it stated that Germany's current economic situation cannot clear various debts because of the loss of territories. If Germany wants to escape from the current crisis, it must first reclaim its old territories. The German representative's remarks are based on Hitler's policies. Although the time of reclamation is not attached, the issue has been raised. It is still difficult to predict what countermeasures the countries will take. This case is of great importance to Japan, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry attaches great importance to the issue of its South Seas Islands sovereignty.

<p>Seeking US Agreement</p>
<p>Rumors of Compromise on British-US Exchange Rate</p>
<p>(London) The currency truce draft has been approved by the British and French governments. If the US reply expresses approval, it can be read out in the Currency Committee. Regarding what attitude President Roosevelt will take on stabilizing the price of the US dollar during the Economic Conference, there are two different speculations. One said that the current decline in the market price of the US dollar on the US exchange shows that the United States will not abandon the measures taken on currency at this moment. The other said that the Congress has now adjourned and the President's actions are more free, or he may express acceptance. It is also said that the draft submitted to Washington is an exchange of notes between Washington and London, opening up a way for compromise in advance before it was drafted. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The delegates are now resting at the end of the week, so it is still doubtful whether currency negotiations will continue today. According to the most reliable sources, even if there is a way to stabilize the currency, it is purely temporary and is only the beginning of a permanent solution, because permanent stability depends on economic law. There may not be an announcement of currency stabilization measures before Tuesday. (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to US sources this afternoon, the British and US gold equalization method has actually been compromised, with one pound of British gold worth approximately four dollars and five cents in US dollars. (Seventeenth Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to news reported in the newspapers, a temporary agreement to consolidate the gold pound and gold dollar between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may be reached in about a day or two. The Daily Mail claimed that a gentleman's agreement has been reached between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and the only issue to be resolved is how to determine the gold dollar exchange rate. The Financial Times claimed that the price of the gold pound will be temporarily set at approximately four dollars and four cents to four dollars and seven cents. Furthermore, the Financial News stated that the exchange rate of the monetary system between the United Kingdom and France, which is currently implemented, can also be adopted between the United Kingdom and the United States to determine the exchange rate between the gold pound and the gold dollar. The US government can cancel it at any time, but during this London conference, if the exchange rate between the two countries can be determined, the delegates of various countries can carry out conference affairs as much as possible within a few weeks without having to worry about the rise and fall of the gold pound and gold dollar.

<p>Plans to Submit Recommendations to the Conference</p>
<p>Compromise with Japan Does Not Involve Politics</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen declared that China would join the World Tariff Truce, support genuine disarmament, and cooperate with calling countries to jointly strive to raise prices, and recognized that stabilizing silver prices is extremely important in realizing the various aspirations of the Economic Conference, and will ask the conference to set up another subcommittee to discuss the silver issue. However, although Soong guaranteed that China would join the tariff truce, he still reserved the right to notify one month in advance to stop participating. Soong stated when meeting with reporters after the Economic Committee adjourned that China could not hastily promise how much tariffs could be reduced, because the intention of Western tariffs is to protect industry, while the intention of Chinese tariffs is to generate national revenue, and the protection component is extremely small. He also said that disarmament is also an important plan to revive the economy, but the Far East will continue to be the source of anxiety in the world, due to the current relationship between China and Japan. As far as the Chinese people are concerned, they unanimously oppose Japan and its entire Far East policy. There is very little difference between Japan's political policy and military policy towards China. If the Chinese government establishes any political understanding with Japan, it may not be able to maintain its life for twenty-four hours. He has also not seen that the Chinese government will have anyone who can recognize the Japanese seizure of Manchuria. (Sixteenth National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen told a Reuters reporter today that the 50 million yuan borrowed from China by the US Financial Relief Agency is actually for the purchase of cotton and wheat, but how China uses the funds after selling the cotton and wheat is purely China's own business. The proposal of the Legislative Yuan regarding the use of loans is only an expression of opinion. Soong Finance Minister spoke about the World Economic Conference, saying that the compromise on US debts has cleared the air and slightly eased China's proposal to the Economic Committee and suggestions on white silver. He very much hoped to see the silver market stabilized and the price of silver raised. Soong Finance Minister continued to talk about the Far East, saying that China still hopes that the League of Nations will handle the Sino-Japanese dispute. The truce with Japan is limited to military affairs and not civil affairs. Any government in China that compromises with Japan and recognizes the occupation of Manchuria will definitely not be able to support it for twenty-four hours. (Sixteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Germany Decides to Postpone Debt Payments <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>75 Million Marks Extended to Next Year</p>
<p>Advisory Committee Asks Creditors to Reduce Interest Rates</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of the German government and representatives of the German National Bank met here today with the advisory committee of the creditor countries' banks and decided to revise the bad debt agreement set in 1933. The funds required by the German National Discount Bank, totaling 75 million marks, can be extended to February next year for payment. At the request of the President of the German National Bank, Schacht, the advisory committee will ask the creditors' committees of various countries to propose a reduction in the current interest rate. It has been found that the 1933 agreement was the third bad debt agreement, signed in Berlin on February 16 by representatives of 1,500 German debtors and 250 creditors from various countries, with a debt amount of approximately 370 million marks (equivalent to 180 million pounds in British gold). There are more than 6,000 debt contracts. The agreement is valid from January 1933 to the end of February 1934. Representatives from the UK, the US, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland all participated in the discussion at that time. In the past year, 608,000,000 marks have been issued, equivalent to 30.4 million pounds in British gold, which is 14% of the total debt under the second bad debt agreement. At the same time, the credit protected by the agreement is 378,000,000 marks, equivalent to 18.9 million pounds in British gold, which has not been used for various reasons. Now a new bad debt agreement has been established regarding German short-term loans, which reduces the average interest rate by 5%, but stipulates that the total amount of credit will be reduced by 5%. It is found that the total amount is now 260,000,000 pounds in British gold. Foreign creditors have the right to calculate and recover foreign debts borrowed from banks in Dewey marks at a rate of 50%, and recover foreign debts borrowed from the industrial sector without collateral at a rate of 30%. The funds paid according to this can be used in Germany, such as investing in real estate or mortgages or securities, and the period of this investment is at least five years. However, if the Congress believes that this kind of repayment is sufficient to endanger important national economic interests, it still has the right to veto this kind of repayment.

<h3 id="e45">Formal Announcement to the Representative of the Pacific International Studies Association from the East <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Pacific International Studies Association has been decided to be held in Canada on August 14th. The topics for discussion are expected to include economic conflicts, international mediation tools and institutions for self-determination, and educational issues. Our country's representatives have already arrived in Shanghai awaiting their ship, about to embark for the meeting at a time when the Pacific Ocean is turbulent, unpredictable and changing. Representatives from various countries will, as usual, gather together and have a jovial discussion. Their peaceful and modest attitude and spirit of striving for international cooperation are truly admirable.</p>
<p>We still remember that the last meeting of the Pacific International Studies Association was held just after the September 18th Incident. And at this meeting, the North China Ceasefire Agreement has already been signed. This association was originally established to promote international cooperation. However, discussion is discussion, and aggression is aggression. In the year and a half since then, our country has lost millions of square miles of land, our sovereignty has been undermined, our territory has been seized, and our people have been trampled upon. Then, what is the purpose of the association's meetings and discussions? And what benefit do they bring? The answer to this question is clear without needing to be answered. I recall that at the last meeting, the association tried its best to avoid mentioning the Northeast issue. It took great pains before the meeting. Even during the meeting, few representatives from various countries spoke out for justice. This further proves that the so-called "scholars" and "celebrities" in the association all consider their national positions when advocating and arguing. They all take the interests of their own countries as the premise. The so-called fair attitude of scholars in international cooperation is just deceptive talk.</p>
<p>We already clearly understand the nature of the association. Therefore, we don't need to have any extravagant hopes for the association. However, as our country's representatives are about to depart, we also have to sincerely advise our representatives: (1) On this trip, you must carefully consider your own position when advocating and arguing. You must always consider the dignity of the country and the national spirit first, and you must ensure that it does not go against the will of the majority of our people. All fallacies, such as advocating waiting for fifty years to resolve the Northeast issue, or suggesting that the enemy stop military aggression and change their methods to conquer our national spirit, we sincerely hope that they will not be heard in international venues. (2) Today's international political situation is, of course, viewed differently by the benevolent and the wise, and opinions may not be entirely the same. However, the facts of the past three years are clear to the world. The aggression of the Japanese imperialists against our country is becoming more and more active. This is also something that no one can deny. The great powers are all vying with each other and only pursuing their own self-interests. The so-called international peace and international cooperation are all smokescreens to deceive weak nations. This can be seen from the active preparations for war by the great powers. We also sincerely hope that our country's representatives can recognize the current facts and not be intoxicated by the beautiful name of international scholars and make remarks that are scorned by the people of the country. (3) Do not just flaunt your fluent English and forget the essence of a certain issue. Even when discussing Chinese issues, do not speak from the perspective of foreigners and adopt a neutral attitude. All three of these are the minimum expectations we have for our country's representatives, and they are also the only expectations. The Pacific International Studies Association is responsible for "correcting the mistakes of politicians by using propaganda and education from the standpoint of scholars." However, based on the past, we do not dare to believe that the association can fulfill its responsibility.</p>

<p>Telegram from Xi'an to Shenbao and various newspapers and charitable organizations: Shaanxi's disaster is extremely severe, and the people are in danger. The spring wheat harvest is poor and there is no rain. There is a situation where it may be impossible to survive. We urgently need to provide great relief to solve the crisis. We have always admired the charitable organizations for their hard work and their repeated efforts to relieve starvation. The benevolent soup and righteous grains come from all directions. The survivors in Shaanxi are deeply grateful. But considering the current situation, we feel very embarrassed. Reports of disasters from various districts are pouring in. Based on personal observations, such as in Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, Fengxiang, Qian, and other districts, the summer wheat has no grains and the autumn harvest has not yet been planted. Without disaster relief and loans, and rapid planning, we fear that the delay in transportation will cause millions of lives to starve to death. The tragedy cannot be ignored. We specially telegraphed to appeal, maintain and encourage the collection of large sums of disaster relief funds to save these survivors. The disaster victims are fortunate, and all of Shaanxi is fortunate. We specially telegraphed to report and hope that you will adopt our suggestion. Zhang Ji bowed, Xian.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Thousands of People Engaged in Public Works</p>
<p>Aviation Bureau Builds 290 Aircraft</p>
<p>Washington, 16th - President Roosevelt's new plan to remedy the difficulties of the times was launched today. It is expected that it will be fully implemented within 20 days. Today, three administrative officials were specially appointed. General Johnson, a soldier, lawyer, and manufacturer, is in charge of the relief industry plan; a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission is the Federal Commissioner for Adjusting Railroads; and Colonel Sawyer, a soldier, is in charge of state construction affairs. All industries and railroads that are willing to accept federal supervision are included in the government's relief plan. The policy of comprehensive adjustment is to control overproduction and seek the existence of each individual, allowing mergers of the same industry, and thinking of cooperation and production everywhere, in order to reduce competition and eliminate waste. As for the public construction plan, 360,000 people will be engaged in afforestation and river dredging, and several million people will be engaged in house construction. Thousands of people will be engaged in building new warships and new aircraft, and 400 million yuan will be allocated to various states for road construction.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th - Today, Aviation Bureau Chief Major General King asked the President to include the construction of new aircraft in the public construction plan, planning to build 290 aircraft for the aircraft carriers that are about to be built. In addition, 150 aircraft will be built to replace the original aircraft that are about to be allocated to the new aircraft carrier USS Ranger. The estimated cost is more than 15 million yuan. The President immediately agreed to build 290 new aircraft, and believed that the cost of replacing the 150 old aircraft should be paid from the Navy's regular expenses.</p>
<p>Reuters, 16th - Washington - Before adjourning, the U.S. Congress granted great power to the President, so President Roosevelt is now practically like a dictator. The Industrial Management Act, the Bank Reform Act, and the Railroad Reorganization Act have now been signed by the President, so the number of important laws that have been implemented today is greater than on any date in American history. Roosevelt will go to the Massachusetts coast tonight and will take a yacht with his son and old friends for a half-month voyage. He plans to take the new cruiser Indianapolis to the Potomac River at the end of June at Campobello Island. It is said that if the world economy is greatly in failure at that time, President Roosevelt may take this cruiser directly to London. The Bank Reform Act has now become law and will become the largest permanent piece of legislation ever enacted by Congress. From now on, the American banking system will be actively reformed, and the various ills that have previously led to bank closures and financial turmoil may be eliminated. The Industrial Management Act stipulates 3.3 billion yuan in public</p>
<p>Construction project funds, and authorizes the government to implement regulations on adjusting industrial output, wages, and prices when necessary, for a period of two years.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th - The U.S. Congress has adjourned. Among the various emergency legislation bills, only the bill authorizing the President to ban the shipment of military supplies to belligerent countries has not been passed, because the leaders of both houses believe that there is no need to urgently pass this bill at present. In addition, there was no indication of the war debt issue in the last few days. Although Senator Johnson strongly urged the adoption of his plan to prohibit financial transactions with delinquent countries, he has not been able to get the Senate to discuss it in detail. In addition, the President's proposal to appoint non-Hawaiian residents as the governor of Hawaii was also not discussed because of the large number of opponents. Today, the U.S. President is signing the various bills that the Congress finally passed, and has signed the relief industry bill. This bill temporarily suspends the provisions of the antitrust law for industrialists and businessmen who are willing to accept government supervision. He also signed the Glass-Steagall Bank Reform Act, which prevents the use of deposits in the stock market for speculation and improves the banking system to make it more stable. He also signed the plan to reorganize the administrative agencies. This plan merges redundant agencies and reorganizes the administrative system. For example, the Office of the Commissioner of the U.S. Court for China will be transferred from the State Department to the Department of Justice. The changes will take effect in sixty days. As for the bill to reduce veterans' benefits, it is expected that the President will also sign it and announce it. This bill reduces veterans' benefits by up to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Wallace announced the government's three-year grain management plan. The surtax levied on the processing and manufacturing of agricultural products first sets a standard price for the agricultural product. If the market price is lower than the standard price, a surtax will be levied according to the difference. The tax revenue will be used to subsidize farmers who reduce the number of acres planted by more than 20 percent compared to last year. For example, the standard price for wheat is set at 89 cents per bushel. The current average price is 59 cents, so a surtax of 30 cents per bushel will be levied on wheat made into flour or breakfast foods and other products, making a total of 89 cents. It is estimated that this tax will generate 150 million yuan in the first year. The management plan for cotton has not yet been announced. According to this, the surtax is only levied on sales within the country, and exports are exempt from tax in order to compete with other countries.</p>
<p>Havas, 17th - Washington - President Roosevelt has now departed for Massachusetts and will transfer to Maine to take a small yacht to tour the Atlantic coast for rest.</p>

<p>Exclusively for Sale Overseas</p>
<p>National seventeenth Moscow telegram: It was recently learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Russian government is planning to issue special public bonds of approximately 25 million rubles, exclusively for purchase by foreigners. However, in order to avoid objections from other countries to the issuance of Soviet Russian bonds, these bonds will only be formally sold in the Soviet Russia and can be purchased from banks around the world that communicate with Soviet Russian financial institutions. Therefore, it is practically the same as selling them overseas. If this measure is successful, it is said that another batch will be issued soon. The conditions are quite favorable. In addition to one percent interest, it can also guarantee that purchasers will not be subject to losses due to fluctuations in the country's currency.</p>

<p>To Discuss a 300 Million Loan Issue</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Paris Sixteenth: Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss arrived here by plane from London this afternoon. The French Socialist Party strongly opposes it, putting the French government in a difficult position, because the government now relies on the votes of the Socialist Party. Mr. Dollfuss met with French Foreign Minister Pongue this evening to discuss the French share of the 300 million Austrian currency loan to Austria. He later met with Prime Minister Daladi. Prior to this, Herriot had agreed at the Lausanne Conference that France would provide one third of the loan, and the French Parliament had approved the loan a few months ago, but the government has been hesitant to order the issuance of the loan because the Socialist Party opposes Dollfuss' dictatorial stance. Dollfuss cannot promise to hold parliamentary elections now, because if they are held, he will definitely be defeated by the National Socialist Party. However, if Mr. Dollfuss can present a reasonable constitutional guarantee, he will be able to obtain the loan.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London Sixteenth: A reporter from the Paris "Tough Newspaper" interviewed Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and asked for his opinion. Tao claimed that he was not too worried about the recent changes in German-Austrian relations. He said, "Austria's internal order is extremely stable, but there are still many things I need to do. I met with several important people in London and will continue to visit important people in Paris. As for the dispute between Austria and the National Socialist Party, it is not over yet, but we can still rely on ourselves and we are not afraid of the behavior of the National Socialist Party. It is also said that this matter is Austria's internal affair and only concerns Austria. We will find a way to end it. We will never compromise with the National Socialist Party." Dollfuss concluded by saying, "Where there are no diplomatic problems, we should not force them to exist. Austria's internal order should also be left to the Austrians to solve themselves. We hope that the German government will eventually understand this."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vienna Sixteenth: The first result of Germany's attack on Austria's independence has now occurred, namely, that British newspapers have expressed sympathy for Austria. British newspapers criticized the German-Austrian conflict, and Vienna was shocked for a time. The British Morning Post stated that the National Socialist Party's attitude is a danger to European peace, and the newspaper even proposed that the international community jointly intervene to protect Austria. The Viennese newspapers uniformly reprinted this kind of argument. The French and Italian newspapers also supported Austria. The New Vienna Daily stated that the intention expressed by the public opinion of various countries shows that the major powers have already exchanged views on the Austrian-German conflict. The Federal Post stated that Germany should not allow uncontrolled elements to place Germany in a dangerous position.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris Seventeenth: Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss has departed from Paris to return to Vienna.</p>

<p>Roosevelt asked Ishii, "The sincerity expressed by your government in this preparatory consultation and the appointment of Your Excellency as its representative are most satisfactory to me. Yesterday, British Prime Minister MacDonald sent me a letter saying that unless the United States shows sincerity in resolving the war debt issue, the Economic Conference may not achieve anything. I dare to believe that compared to the world economic recovery issue, the war debt issue is a minor matter. It is absolutely impossible for war debt to determine the fate of the conference. Regarding policies towards Japan, the new government does not hold the same biases as the Republican Party. The issue of 'Manchukuo' is a thing of the past and does not require any discussion. We only need to pay attention to whether 'Manchukuo' will be an independent country or a colony of Japan in the future." Ishii replied, "I agree with Your Excellency the President. The independence of 'Manchukuo' is a de facto reality. The country is a completely independent nation. I dare to believe that the healthy development of 'Manchukuo' can contribute to peace in the Far East." Roosevelt said, "I firmly believe that there is only one way to break the deadlock in the world economy, and that is to expand the Non-Aggression Treaty. Therefore, I propose to all countries to re-sign the attached treaty to make the foundation of the treaty more solid. I sincerely hope that the Japanese government can guarantee that it has nothing to do with 'Manchukuo' and participate in this treaty." Ishii replied, "Japan has Russia in the north and China in the west, both with special national conditions, so it cannot agree. Moreover, today, after withdrawing from the League of Nations, we must consider this matter even more cautiously." Ishii also said, "Japan cannot unconditionally participate in the new</p>

<p>The Issue of Feng Yuxiang's Title</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping. Since Feng Yuxiang expressed his attitude regarding the Chahar situation, military movements within Juyongguan have ceased as of this morning. Fang Zhenwu's troops departed from Xuanhua to the north on the 13th and are stationed in the vicinity of Zhangjiakou. Approximately one thousand troops remain in Xuanhua to construct defensive fortifications, and there is currently no intention to move further north. When the majority of the troops departed from Xuanhua, they requisitioned a significant number of laborers and horse-drawn vehicles in the area and dug trenches at various stations between Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou, including Shaling and Lingzi. They have not abandoned preparations for war. Although the political issue in Chahar Province has come to a conclusion, Japanese cavalry troops have gathered in Dolon, and the 14th Division has also moved from Rehe towards eastern Chahar, with unclear intentions. There remains a potential for the outbreak of conflict. Recently, Japanese aircraft have frequently flown over areas such as Nankou and Qinglongqiao on the PingSui Railway for low-altitude reconnaissance. Additionally, Japanese aircraft have been spotted multiple times in areas such as Xitang in western Pingxi. Their intentions are difficult to discern. The Japanese 8th Division, formerly stationed in Miyun, has been withdrawn and is heading towards Rehe, with a large portion concentrated in Luanping and moving towards western Rehe. It is still unknown whether they will enter the Guyuan area of eastern Chahar. It is rumored that the Japanese army has plans to threaten eastern Chahar. If this is true, then the puppet troops under Liu Guitang will inevitably seize the opportunity to encroach on Zhangbei. The situation in North China remains far from optimistic. Jin troops under Li Fuying are reportedly digging trenches and holding fast near Yongjiabao and Tianzhen, their intention being solely to defend the Jin border. Fang Zhenwu himself arrived in Zhangjiakou from Xuanhua yesterday (the 14th) to meet with Feng Yuxiang. Fang offered his views on the current situation to Feng. Currently, Feng's guard unit and Zhang Lisheng's cavalry are still holding firm in Zhangbei, and the defense is secure. The central government is still considering arrangements for Fang's troops in the future. Song Zheyuan's return to Chahar will be implemented after the Chahar situation is resolved. The order for Shang Zhen to govern Henan will also be issued soon. There are two rumors circulating regarding Feng's title: (1) The central government will establish a Northwest Border Defense Committee and appoint Feng as its chairman; (2) Feng will be appointed as the National Afforestation and Land Reclamation Director-General, with a designated budget of 30,000 yuan. However, these are just proposals, and whether or not they are accurate depends on Feng's personal decision. (15th)</p>
<p>Non-Aggression Pact and Disarmament Treaty are because China is implementing a boycott of Japanese goods. This is the primary reason for Japan's economic aggression. Russia is also waging an ideological war against Japan. This situation cannot be ignored either. Japan plans to propose a ban on Chinese boycotts at the Economic Conference. Therefore, in the new Non-Aggression Pact, if the Chinese boycott is not prohibited, and border crossings for self-defense are also considered aggression, Japan will definitely not agree. Roosevelt replied, "I have heard that the Chinese boycott is organized. This President also believes it is inappropriate. The Lytton Report also considered it an illegal means. If Japan proposes it at the Economic Conference, the United States will provide appropriate assistance."</p>
<h3 id="e83">Content of the Second Meeting <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Ishii said, "According to my research, the original nature of Japanese-American trade goods is different, and there has never been a fundamental conflict. Rather, it is a relationship of mutual dependence. Not only can we walk hand in hand, but it can be said that the two countries need to cooperate." Roosevelt replied, "In principle, there is no disagreement. According to my subordinates, domestic businesses are very alarmed by the import of Japanese rubber shoes. A report from the specialized committee also stated that the retail price of Japanese rubber shoes in the domestic market is very low. I was shocked and impressed upon hearing this." Ishii said, "Regarding the issue of military reduction, Japan can no longer tolerate the naval ratio of the Washington and London treaties." Roosevelt replied, "I also agree that the military equipment of all countries should be thoroughly reduced, to the point where it can only carry out international police work. If the countries do not respond to the demands of the United States, the United States will prepare 400 million US dollars to compete with the countries to expand military equipment." Roosevelt said, "Top European politicians, in order to break through the world crisis, advocate that there is no other way but to drive the war between Japan and the United States to create a wartime boom. I heard this in a meeting with a certain major European politician. The two countries must be wary and not be fooled." Ishii replied, "The Japanese government appreciates the kindness of your country. In order to clear the dark clouds between the two countries, Japan believes that the two countries should take the Bryan Treaty as the basis for signing an arbitration treaty. All disputes should be subject to the adjudication of the International Investigation Committee." Roosevelt said, "I also agree very much. I will immediately order the authorities to investigate and study the specific case and contact Ambassador Debuchi."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th. Foreign Minister Uchida is currently carefully studying the issue of concluding a US-Japan arbitration treaty or a peace treaty. However, according to information from Ambassador Debuchi, President Roosevelt and those close to him acknowledge the need to conclude such a treaty, but do not wish to materialize this matter while the World Economic Conference is in progress. The Japanese government has decided that after the Economic Conference, and before reciprocal negotiations on the overall trade relationship are held in Washington, it will not raise this issue for the time being. The draft treaty is still under study in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and its main points have been internally determined as follows: Based on the 1913 Bryan Treaty or the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, the principle of human equality is recognized. However, the issue of immigration is set aside as a concession and placed outside the scope of application. The Monroe Doctrine of the United States is recognized, and at the same time, the Monroe Doctrine of Asia must be recognized. The "Manchukuo" and the Sino-Japanese Incident are placed within the scope of application.</p>

<p>The Japanese Government Conceals Embarrassment</p>
<p>Havre, 17th, Bombay Telegram. It is generally believed that after Japanese cotton merchants decided to boycott Indian cotton, the majority of members of the Cotton Yarn Brokers Association here intend to boycott Japanese members of the Association in retaliation. The President of the Association recently issued a public notice, requesting British spinning mill owners to purchase Indian cotton as much as possible.</p>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 17th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are carefully deliberating on a policy towards India in order to conclude a new treaty to replace the trade treaty that became invalid on October 10th. The Japanese government fears that if it attends the meeting without prior knowledge of India's true intentions, it may reveal Japan's embarrassment to the Indian side. Therefore, it first ordered Consul General Miyake to begin preliminary negotiations with India to observe the results and decide on the formal appointment of representatives. The matters on which the Japanese government inquired of the Indian authorities are as follows: Does the Indian authority have any intention of concluding a new treaty after October 10th? The Japanese government advocates that the new treaty adopt the most-favored-nation clause. What is India's approach to this policy? Does India have the sincerity to provide mutually beneficial and fair adjustments to all types of trade goods between Japan and India?</p>

<p>The Army's Budget Requires 400 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 17th. The Army authorities are considering new projects in next year's budget due to the significant international situation in the future. The improvement of military equipment for war must be completed rapidly. The Army Minister explained his reform plan in the parliament. The opinion of the Army's leadership unanimously decided to allocate 220 million yuan in next year's budget to enrich new weapons and improve combat equipment, 30 million yuan for the expansion and construction of warehouses and factories, and 50 million yuan for other miscellaneous expenses. In addition, there will be expenses for the Manchurian Incident. Next year's budget will total 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th. The Japanese government decided on the budget policy at yesterday's regular cabinet meeting. Various parties criticized it as follows: Koki Hirota of the Seiyukai also said that it had no new significance and was the same as in previous years. It is of course the duty of various provinces to reduce political expenses, but to date, very few have implemented it. As a result, various provinces and the Ministry of Finance have no way but to compromise. Next year's budget will certainly be no exception. The only question is how to reduce the deficit bonds. We must wait and see about this. Kotaro Ogawa of the Minseito said that the Finance Minister's opinion is most necessary in the current situation. The Navy hopes to request 500 million yuan in continuation funds for the second supplementary plan. The Army also wants 245 million yuan. As a result, the finances will inevitably be very inflated. At this time, the Minister must proceed with political considerations. Therefore, even if there are two or three cabinet members who oppose it, he hopes that this budget policy will be realized. Kyoichi Yamamichi of the National League said that the Saito Cabinet's annual budget is an exception. However, if it is compiled, then the real emergency period will begin from next year onwards. Therefore, the following countermeasures must be considered in next year's budget, namely, a permanent source of revenue must be found for the interest on new bonds, as well as for national defense, diplomacy, and industry. In addition, the special accounting for the Manchurian Incident also needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Japanese Provide Covert Protection; Japanese Troops in the East Have Not Withdrawn</p>
<p>Authorities Are Negotiating with Japanese Side to Resolve the Issue of Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping. Japanese troops in Eastern Hebei and Northern Pingbei are withdrawing successively. Japanese troops in areas east of Tongzhou, such as Xianghe, Sanhe, Zunhua, and Ji County, have mostly retreated and gathered at Xifengkou. The Japanese troops on the front line in Tongzhou first withdrew to Liuguantun, which belongs to Xianghe County. They have now withdrawn from Liuguantun to Foxinzhuang, eight miles east of Xiazhen, which belongs to Sanhe County. There are no traces of Japanese troops in Tong County. The Tong County Magistrate and the Chief of the Public Security Bureau have dispatched local police to take over areas such as YanJiao and Xiji. Japanese troops north of Shunyi, in areas north of Gaoliying and Niulanshan, have also completely withdrawn to Miyun. The evacuated areas are being taken over by local police dispatched by Shunyi County. There are also no Japanese troops in Shunyi. However, although Japanese troops in Northern Pingbei and Eastern Hebei have been withdrawing successively, Japanese troops in the east have not made any preparations to withdraw due to the unresolved issue of puppet troops. Li Jichun and others are attempting to occupy Eastern Hebei for a long time. They have recently established puppet organizations such as military halls in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and other places, appointing local administrative personnel and pretending to be local administrative officials. The Japanese army appears to be uninvolved with the puppet troops on the surface, but in reality, it is providing covert protection and forcibly maintaining a special force. The puppet troops' goal is to be incorporated into our side and reorganized into police, still stationed in Eastern Hebei. Our side does not insist on the reorganization, but it must be transferred for defense. In addition to the negotiations between the authorities and the military attache of the Japanese embassy, ​​Nagatsu, representatives of the puppet army are also negotiating in Tianjin, with Zhang Ting'e and others running around in between. Yesterday (14th) at 6:00 p.m., Nagatsu went to the Jurentang to see He Yingqin and discussed this matter in detail. Our side believes that as long as the Japanese army does not interfere, the suppression and pacification of the puppet troops will be easy to handle. The Japanese side seems to agree on the surface, but is still obstructing it in secret. It will take a considerable period of consultation before a solution can be expected. (June 15)</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Yangtze River Water Level is Soaring <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Orders Flood Prevention in Five Yangtze River Provinces</p>
<p>Breaks Sixty-Year Record</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Regulation Commission Urgently Seeks Disaster Prevention</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Water Level is Broadcasted and Reported</p>
<p>Beijing News. Since the beginning of summer this year, the Yangtze River has been rising day by day due to continuous rain in the upper reaches. After the torrential rain a few days ago, the Xiang River rushed down again, and the river body could not accommodate it, resulting in sudden floods and a gradual disaster. The competent authorities and the residents of the five provinces within the basin are all fearful and uneasy in light of the catastrophic events of two years ago. The Nissin News reporter specially visited Song Xishang, the director of the Engineering Department of the Yangtze River Regulation Commission, to inquire about the extent of the recent rise in the Yangtze River water level, as well as the plans for dike defense and relief. His answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Water Level Breaks Record. According to Song, due to budget limitations in recent years, the Yangtze River Regulation Plan could not be implemented, resulting in daily siltation of the river channel and a gradual reduction in water capacity. In the event of continuous heavy rain, it is easy to cause a rapid rise and disaster. Moreover, tracing back to the periods of high Yangtze River water levels in past years, they were all between July and August. Speaking of the 1931 flood, the Yangtze River water level in mid-June was only 39.5 feet. It later rose to 50 feet at the end of July, and soared to 53.5 feet in mid-August, causing an unprecedented disaster. However, in mid-June of this year, after the torrential rain the day before yesterday, the Yangtze River water level suddenly rose to 41 feet, which is the highest water level in the same month (June) since 1870 (61 years). If there are a little more wind and rain, it may cause a huge disaster. Moreover, this time is not the flood season. In the past, floods would inevitably occur between mid-July and mid-August, but now the water has already risen abnormally. When the flood season arrives, it will be even more worrying. It is hoped that there will be little rainfall in the future, and the water level will drop, so that the flood may be avoided.</p>
<p>Rapid Rise in Water Level Necessitates Flood Prevention. Song continued, the dikes of the Yangtze River have been breached for twenty years. The new dikes that have been repaired are not as strong as the old dikes. Now, considering the new dikes and the rising water levels, there are great hidden concerns. The Hubei Provincial Government and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau should be responsible for the relief and dike defense plans. However, at this extraordinary time, it seems that the two agencies are pushing responsibility to each other. As this Committee is responsible for regulating the Yangtze River, it is urging the two responsible agencies to plan and carefully prepare a plan for preventing dike disasters and providing relief to prevent future disasters. As for the height of the dikes, according to this Committee, after last year's flood, the highest water level was assumed to be 58 feet based on the extent of the flooding, and the dike body must be raised to 58 feet or more to accommodate the amount of water flowing in and combine it with the water in the heart of the river.</p>
<p>Broadcast Yangtze River Water Levels. Song concluded that the daily rise and fall of the water level in each port of the Yangtze River is extremely important, and it is essential that local residents and all parties fully understand this. In view of this, this Committee has specially requested the Ministry of Communications to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the customs of each port of the Yangtze River to report the water level of that day to this Committee by special telegraph at 9:00 am every day, so that it can be reported to the Central Broadcasting Station. Since the 15th, the Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing and other customs have sent special telegrams to report the water level, which has been sent to the Central Radio Station for broadcasting. When reporting the weather, the Yangtze River water level report is added. From now on, the Central Radio Station will report the low and high tides of the Yangtze River every day. (16th)</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Flood Prevention in Five Provinces. Hankou Correspondence: Due to heavy rains in various places, the Yangtze River water level has continued to rise in recent days. According to the Jianghan Customs report, the water level on the 13th was 39.05 meters, 39.08 meters on the 14th, and 41.01 meters on the 15th. The upper reaches of Chongqing rose 3.9 feet in one day. The highest water level is in Wuhan, and the people are more panicked than elsewhere. After the great flood two years ago, Wuhan suffered the most severe disaster, and after the trauma, they cannot help but fear drifting. Chairman Chiang has always attached great importance to flood prevention along the river. Recently, he deemed the measures proposed by the Yangtze River Regulation Committee to be thorough and feasible. On the 14th, the Nanchang Camp sent a telegram to the National Economic Commission, the Yangtze River Regulation Committee, and the governments of the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, instructing the seven organizations to form a Yangtze River Flood Prevention Committee. In accordance with the principle of cooperation between the central and local governments, they should work together to prevent disasters. The original telegram is disclosed as follows: "Nanjing National Economic Commission, Zhenjiang Chairman Gu, Wuchang Chairman Xia, Changsha Chairman He, Anqing Chairman Liu, Nanchang Chairman Xiong, It is said that recently, the Yangtze River volume, the coming fierce To prevent the eventuality, and to avoid repeating the same mistakes, we need to prepare flood control measures as soon as possible. We propose to form the Yangtze River Flood Control Committee, which will be jointly formed by the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the Economic Commission, and the Yangtze River Regulation Committee. The Yangtze River Regulation Committee is responsible for the matter, and all the water conservancy engineers of the seven agencies are assigned to the Yangtze River to take charge of the flood prevention work. The expenses are borne separately by the respective provincial governments and the Economic Commission, and the Central Government is asked to provide subsidies to facilitate the implementation. It is deemed feasible to establish a flood control committee jointly formed by the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the Economic Commission, and the Yangtze River Regulation Committee as requested by the Chairman. It is hoped that you will carefully consider and plan for it, and reply directly to the Yangtze River Regulation Committee for joint action." (Chiang Kai-shek (seal))" (15th)</p>
<p>(Reply from Hubei Provincial Government to Chiang Kai-shek). Hankou Correspondence: The Yangtze River water in Hankou rose slightly on the 16th, with the water mark reaching 41.3 feet, which is 1.9 feet higher than the water level of 39.4 feet on the same day in 1931. The rising water level in Chongqing in the upper reaches is extremely severe, rising by more than 14.8 feet in one day and night. If the Sichuan water continues to flow eastward, the situation will be more dangerous. The Hankou Headquarters has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to report the water level daily for prevention. The Hubei Provincial Government has also ordered the Bureau to rush to complete the unfinished dike project day and night to avoid repeating the mistakes of 1931. On one hand, they telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, endorsing the proposal to jointly establish a flood control committee, saying, "We have received your telegram, stating that the Yangtze River Regulation Committee has proposed that the Yangtze River Flood Control Committee should be jointly formed by the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, the Economic Commission, and the Yangtze River Regulation Committee, It is deemed feasible to plan and implement the project, and instruct you to carefully consider and plan for it, and reply directly to the Yangtze River Regulation Committee for joint action. We agree that the five provincial governments along the Yangtze River and the relevant departments in the central government should cooperate in flood prevention. " Another telegram was sent to Zhou Peizhen, Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee, saying, "We have received Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram, ordering that the views of your Committee that the flood control committee should be jointly formed by the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, the Economic Commission, and your Committee should be implemented. It is essential to cooperate in flood prevention in the face of the surging and severe floods. Your Committee has planned to regulate the entire Yangtze River waterway and is most familiar with the river conditions and dikes upstream and downstream. Please take charge of the implementation of appropriate measures as soon as possible. We are sending this special telegram and await your reply." As for the previous report that 48 forts in Qichun County, eastern Hubei, were breached and more than 100,000 mu of farmland were flooded, the Headquarters ordered the Provincial Government to investigate and reply, as no report had been received. The Provincial Government is now reporting to the Headquarters after receiving a report from Gu Renfa, the Administrative Inspector of the Third District and concurrently the Magistrate of Qichun County, that it is true.

<h3 id="e91">Suzhou Citywide Shop Strike <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Supporting Railway Hotel Capitalists</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The labor dispute at the Railway Hotel has escalated since the County Party Committee detained the hotel owner, Chen Yuting, in the police station. No resolution has been reached. After receiving reports, the central and provincial authorities successively dispatched Qi Zhiping, a member of the Central People's Movement Committee; Sheng Zhuangshu, the chief of the first section of the Provincial Secretariat; and Zhang Gongren, the chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, to Suzhou to investigate the situation. They have since reported their findings to the central and provincial authorities for review. On the 17th, Suzhou's various trade associations, deeming the County Party Committee's handling of the matter inappropriate, convened an emergency meeting at the Chamber of Commerce, resolving to stage a citywide strike in support of the Railway Hotel capitalists. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. The current situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Various trade associations are deeply dissatisfied with the County Party Committee's detention of Chen Yuting, the manager of the Railway Hotel. They first convened an emergency meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on the 16th and telegraphed Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, requesting a swift and strict investigation to appease public anger. On the morning of the 17th, representatives from various trade associations gathered at the Chamber of Commerce again for a temporary emergency meeting, resolving to unanimously strike in support of Chen Yuting, the owner of the Railway Hotel. At 1:30 PM, banks on Guanqian Street and 葑門 [Fēng mén] were the first to close their doors. At 2:00 PM, money shops followed suit and ceased operations. Major stores selling silk, satin, foreign goods, and other items also closed their doors in succession, bringing a dramatic change to the bustling streets of the city. Each store displayed a piece of paper with a slogan that read: "The manager of the hospitality industry has been unjustly arrested. What dire consequences will this precedent set? We unite in support and strictly maintain order." Hotels and inns posted a separate paper that read: "The manager of the same industry has been arrested, our security is lost, and it is difficult to continue business." After receiving reports of the shop strike, the Garrison Headquarters of the Tax Police Regiment, fearing that criminals would take advantage of the situation to cause disturbances, immediately dispatched troops in vehicles to guard the Northern Bureau, the area in front of the North Temple, and the Adai Bridge outside the city to maintain order. The situation appeared tense for a time. Mao Naigong, the director of the Public Security Bureau, urgently ordered personnel from the first, second, and third branches of the city district to persuade the stores to reopen, while also dispatching patrols for strict prevention. Police units also reinforced protection near major factories. Meanwhile, the county government telegraphed the strike situation to the provincial government and the Suzhou-Changzhou Garrison Headquarters and other higher authorities.</p>
<p>After receiving news of the shop strike, County Magistrate Zou Xiaogong immediately summoned representatives from various labor unions, including Lu Jupo, for discussions, saying that since merchants were now taking this action, he hoped that the workers' side would remain calm and not get involved in the vortex, so as not to expand the situation, and await a central solution. The labor union representatives expressed their acceptance. Meanwhile, the Hotel Employees' Union was preparing to convene a general meeting to discuss supporting the Railway Hotel tea servers and submitted a request to the county government on the 17th for approval. County Magistrate Zou, seeing the seriousness of the current situation, advised them to postpone the meeting. Meanwhile, County Magistrate Zou and Public Security Bureau Director Mao convened a meeting with various trade associations at the County Chamber of Commerce at 5:00 PM to persuade the industries to reopen first to reassure the people. At the same time, the labor union support association also held a meeting at the County Party Headquarters to support the workers, making the situation tense.</p>
<p>The County Party Headquarters received repeated telephone reports at around 2:00 PM on the 17th, stating that people were distributing leaflets to various stores, urging them to close down. The County Party Headquarters immediately dispatched Gu Baiyu, a cadre, to investigate the area around Guanqian Street. He found Huang Xueshang, an employee of the Central Hotel, distributing leaflets in front of the Lilli Company, urging the closure of businesses. Gu then twisted Huang into the third branch of the second division of the Public Security Bureau and took 15 leaflets back to the Party Headquarters. Meanwhile, he sent a telegram to the county government, stating that the hospitality industry was sending people to various stores to instigate a strike, which clearly had a major impact, and requesting that personnel be dispatched for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Regarding this case, in addition to receiving a report from the county magistrate here, the provincial government also sent a committee to Suzhou to investigate and report back to the province. On the afternoon of the 17th, the provincial government sent an electric order to Suzhou, the original text of which was very long. The general idea was that regarding this matter, mediation should be carried out first, and if mediation failed, arbitration should be carried out, and if arbitration was ineffective, it should be sent to the court for processing. This time, the above procedures were not followed at all, and the measures taken by the county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau were improper. Moreover, the hospitality industry union had already been disbanded and was fundamentally no longer established, and it was even more inappropriate to rashly detain people based on a letter from the Party Headquarters. Now, Chen Yuting, who was detained, was to be released quickly, the county magistrate should be punished, and the director of the Public Security Bureau should be given a major demerit. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Zou immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau to release Chen, but Chen stated at the detention center of the third branch that he was unwilling to be released until the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 45 trade associations of the banking and money industries in Wuxian sent a circular telegram, the text of which is as follows: For the perusal of various newspaper offices, we recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Department of Civil Affairs, and Department of Construction, stating: "The Suzhou Railway Hotel dismissed two tea waiters, and Chen Zhijun and Yan Yisheng, members of the Wuxian Party Rectification Committee, did not resolve the matter through proper channels. They suddenly arrested the manager and drove out the employees on the evening of the 12th, and sent cadres such as Xu Zishou to take over the business, which is tantamount to robbery. This sets a terrible precedent that has never been seen in Wuxian. Such rampant behavior has caused widespread panic, the law has lost its protection, and it is difficult for stores to operate. The situation is serious, and local safety is a concern. Therefore, we urgently telegraph you to quickly investigate and handle the matter to maintain public order and calm people's minds. We are extremely eager to await your orders." We hope you will investigate and publish the report to promote justice. Wuxian banking industry, money industry, pawn industry, lumber industry, north-south goods industry, and the 45 trade associations, sincerely bow. Another long-distance telephone message reported that at 7:30 PM tonight, the Wuxian County Magistrate, the Director of Public Security, and Zhang Gongren of the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of representatives from various trade associations at the County Chamber of Commerce. Because the representatives of various industries were angry and the order was poor, the county magistrate and others announced that each industry should select seven representatives to discuss the matter with the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. The representatives of each industry immediately put forward three points: ㈠ Immediately dismiss Chen Zhijun and Yan Yisheng of the County Party Committee and severely punish them; ㈡ Effectively guarantee that the Party Committee will no longer illegally arrest merchants in the future; ㈢ Guarantee that Party members will no longer occupy stores in the future. The Provincial Party Committee replied: ㈠ All three requests will be submitted to the Provincial Executive Committee for resolution; ㈡ Before the provincial government decides on a solution to this case, the County Party Committee will be notified by Zhang, the Provincial Party Committee, not to act without authorization, and all parties should strictly maintain order; ㈢ The issue of reopening the market will be discussed by the Provincial Party Committee, the County Magistrate, the Director of Public Security, and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Commerce will be notified. After the meeting, the 45 trade associations telegraphed the Central National Government and Chairman Chiang, requesting that Chen and Yan be dismissed. It is reported that today, representatives from the labor union also visited the County Magistrate to ask the County Magistrate to stop the strike, otherwise the labor union would also take counter-measures. In the evening, Chen Yuting, the manager of the Railway Hotel, and Huang Yunshang, who was arrested for distributing leaflets in Guanqian Street, were released. Tomorrow, except for the banks that are closed as usual due to the holiday, the money shops and merchants have decided to open for business. The troops sent to maintain order in the city were also withdrawn outside the city at 10:00 PM, and the situation has eased.</p>

<p>Jinshanwei, located on the coast of Punan, Songjiang, has a resident named Yang Zhengqing who owns a fishing boat. The other day, the boat owner suddenly received a report stating that one of the fishing boats had an accident in the outer sea. Pirates in a boat emerged from a certain mountain bay and robbed Yang's fishing boat as it passed by. The boat had few valuable items, so they took the boat's captain and first mate onto their pirate boat, raised the sail, and fled. It is learned that the boat owner is currently investigating the whereabouts of the fishing boat. The boat has not yet returned, and it is unknown whether it will return safely.</p>

<p>Cao Guozhen, the chief surgeon of Tongren Hospital in Wuxi, and three others, including Tu family seller Zhu Zongyuan and Zhao Benli, jointly established a large-scale poison pill manufacturing organization inside the destroyed Ruisheng Silk Cocoon Warehouse under the Gongyun Bridge in the county. The Fourth Branch of the Jiangyin Drug Investigation Team discovered the matter and dispatched personnel to arrest them. They arrested Zhang Yanbin and three other accountants, along with the stolen goods, and escorted them to Cheng. However, the main culprits, Cao Guozhen, Zhu Zongyuan, and others, escaped and fled to Shanghai. Later, a Mr. Wei went to Cheng to bail out Zhang Yanbin in order to track down the main culprits. However, after Zhang's release for half a month, the main culprits were still not found. Yesterday, Director He dispatched personnel to arrest Zhang in Cheng and sent him along with the stolen goods to the Zhenjiang General Office for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tax Police Chief Investigates Commercial Port Boundary <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry approved the establishment of a commercial port within a specified boundary. However, the opening of the commercial port in Xiyi took place between 1922 and 1923, when Yang Shounan was the director. Although he actively promoted it, and the Ministry appointed a boundary demarcation committee in 1924, the demarcation was not implemented due to local opposition and frequent political turmoil. The boundary has not been finalized due to numerous obstacles. As a result, disputes have frequently arisen with old salt merchants. Subsequently, the Fine Salt Company submitted a request that was approved by the Executive Yuan, stating that the prosperous roads around the outer city of Xiyi, from Jingyun in the east to Kaiyuan in the west, were all areas for the sale of fine salt. The company then expanded its business to the surrounding countryside, and the salt sales decreased, leading to renewed disputes over the boundary. The other day, Zhang Zhongli, the chief of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Inspection Branch of the Tax Police Bureau, specially accompanied salt merchant representatives Lu Zhongdan and Luo Yangxuan, as well as Yan Dayong, the chief of the sixth district stationed in Changzhou, Wang Yusheng, the chief of the branch stationed in Xiyi, and Wu Hanzhuang, the inspector-general of the Changzhen district, along with patrol captains Liu Yunlong and Wang Wenhai, to Xiyi. They contacted the chiefs of each district through the sixth branch of the Public Security Bureau and went to the commercial port area to investigate the boundary. Director Zhang also invited County Magistrate Yan and representatives from both the traditional salt merchants and the fine salt company to a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 17th) morning. The fine salt company did not send representatives to attend because the sales area had already been stipulated by an order from the Executive Yuan, making further discussion unnecessary. As a result, Director Zhang decided to submit the commercial port boundary map, the opinions expressed in writing by Shuangli, and the proposals of the Chamber of Commerce to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry for approval.</p>

<p>The Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association recently received a tip-off that the Qi Zhengyan Lihua Cotton Weaving Factory was purchasing a large batch of anti-Japanese yarn in Shanghai, which would be delivered to the factory soon. At around 5:00 AM on the 16th, the inspectors took a car to the factory and found more than 200 packages of unlicensed anti-Japanese yarn in the factory's warehouse. They then received another tip-off that a cargo ship had sailed east in an attempt to escape, so they immediately tracked it down. After chasing it for about seven miles, they intercepted the ship and found 15 pieces of Liuma brand anti-Japanese yarn. They ordered it to return to the factory, and then took the factory's accountant, Lin Youe, and more than 800 packages of anti-Japanese yarn back to the city. They convened an emergency meeting and decided to value the seized anti-Japanese yarn and impose penalties in accordance with regulations. If the accountant Lin Youe has a reliable shop guarantor, he will be allowed to be released.</p>

<p>The Changfeng Cloth Factory outside the Shuibeimen Gate in Changshu has been very successful in its business, but it is very harsh on its female workers. They work from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, which makes the female workers resentful. The other day, the factory heavily punished and ordered a female worker named Gu Yueyuan to weave more cloth because she had woven damaged cloth, which aroused the anger of the female workers, who agreed to strike. They went to the Public Security Branch Office in the jurisdiction to report that they were being oppressed by the factory and requested relief and a reduction in working hours. The police officers from the branch office went to mediate, and the factory was willing to reduce the working hours, and the female worker Gu Yueyuan was also willing to resign voluntarily, and the matter was settled. Both parties agreed to implement the agreement on the 16th, but unexpectedly, the factory suddenly went back on its word and insisted on suspending the employment of several people who had led the strike, which led to another strike. The female workers had a firm attitude and settled accounts with the factory after measuring the dimensions and amounts of cloth. When the Public Security Bureau heard the news, they went to mediate again, but the factory was also willing to close down because the cloth sales were sluggish. Both sides went to extremes, and the disturbance became more serious.</p>

<p>Wu Ni, a widow in the Changshou Temple area of the Tenth District, is nearly thirty years old and has a graceful appearance.

Fearing that he would be a burden in the future, she had long planned to kill him. After dinner on the 14th of this month, Ni strangled A'er to death with a rope. Fearing that she would be suspected, she placed the body upside down in a chamber pot. She remained calm, locked the door, and went out to work in the fields. When she returned home in the evening, she pretended to be sad and told her neighbors that her son had died in the chamber pot. The neighbors did not suspect anything at first and deeply lamented. Unexpectedly, when the body was being prepared for burial the next day, the rope marks on the neck were obvious, and the news spread throughout the neighborhood. It is now reported that the county government will send someone to examine the body.</p>

They confessed that at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, Guo Yanjun had arranged with Xue Dalong, Gao Xingfa, and Wang Xicai to lure Wang Zhongxin to Dongwai.

<h3 id="e105">Four Battalion, Company, and Platoon Leaders Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In September of last year, the Zhejiang Security Brigade received a complaint from Pan Tianzheng and others in Ninghai County, accusing Ji Liang, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Fifth Regiment of the Ninghai Security Brigade, of corruption, embezzlement, and illegally collecting opium taxes. A secret order was issued to the regiment and the county to conduct a detailed investigation. Later, the case was shelved because the person involved in the case, Platoon Leader Yang Guozhen, fled to avoid punishment and was wanted but not found. In March of this year, Yang Guozhen suddenly changed his name to Yang Zhicai and came to Hangzhou in disguise, still seeking a job with the Security Department, thus walking into a trap and being detained. He confessed that in May of last year, Battalion Commander Wei Liang sent Adjutant Hu Nai, Company Commander Liao Tingfan, and other private individuals to various areas to investigate opium seedlings. The village chiefs requested exemption from taxation because the opium seedlings were ready for harvest. After negotiations, the village chiefs issued five promissory notes totaling about four or five hundred yuan and handed them to his private individuals to take back to the battalion headquarters. Later, when a secret investigation committee from the provincial government arrived in the county, all opium seedlings had to be eradicated. Fearing that the public would object, Ji Liang sent the promissory notes to the village chiefs through Yang Yingshi, the company clerk. The Security Department reported the incident and immediately telegraphed the Fifth Regiment to suspend Battalion Commander Ji Liang, Company Commander Liao Tingfan, and former Adjutant Hu Nai, who was now the Company Commander, and jointly escort them, along with Yang Yingshi, the company clerk, and squad leader Feng Zairong, who were also involved in the case. A military court was organized for trial, and they confessed without hesitation. It was determined that Ji Liang and others were all incumbent military officers who dared to condone the planting of opium poppies and demand promissory notes, which was an unforgivable crime. According to the provisions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and the Zhejiang Province Provisional Regulations for Eradicating Drugs of the Republic of China Criminal Law, they were sentenced to death. At 9:00 AM yesterday (the 17th), the Security Department sent personnel to execute Battalion Commander Ji Liang, Company Commander Hu Nai, Liao Tingfan, and Platoon Leader Yang Zhicai by firing squad. Yang Yingshi and Feng Zairong were acquitted and released.</p>

<p>Central Telegram Orders Song Ziwen to Proceed</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Misunderstands and Sends Telegram for Explanation</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, received reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Columbia Road yesterday morning and spoke about the various issues of the Sino-American loan and its uses. Mr. Sun first stated that Song Ziwen was proceeding with this Sino-American loan based on the intentions of the Central Government. After Song's departure from the country, the National Defense Committee convened a meeting to discuss China's specific plans for the Washington Conference. Public opinion felt that China's agricultural and forestry economy was on the verge of collapse, which had a significant impact on the national economy, people's livelihood, and the world economy. It was necessary to take emergency measures to provide relief. Therefore, it was decided to instruct Song to seek material assistance from the United States to revive China's economy. After Song received the order and consulted repeatedly in the United States, the cotton and wheat loan was finally established.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of cotton and wheat, Mr. Sun continued to say that this American cotton and American wheat loan was originally a short-term credit loan, which was completely different from the nature of ordinary foreign debt. The regulations for American cotton stipulate that within three months of the arrival of the goods in China, one-tenth of the price must be paid first, and the rest will be repaid in installments. In the future, the proceeds will be used to develop the Northwest and construct transportation and water conservancy. The Legislative Yuan submitted and passed the Sino-American Loan Agreement yesterday (the 16th) and resolved to organize a Loan Management Committee to avoid waste. However, the details of the organization and the allocation of personnel must be decided by the Central Political Conference.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's Misunderstanding Mr. Hu Zhantang, who resides in Hong Kong, has a lot of misunderstandings about the Sino-American loan and has telegraphed me to express his opposition. Mr. Hu's reasons are: First, this loan is Mr. Song's personal action and has not been passed by the Legislative Yuan; second, past domestic debts have been consumed in civil wars, and the establishment of this Sino-American loan may lead to another outbreak of civil war, and the Legislative Yuan should deny it. I have now telegraphed Mr. Hu in detail to explain that this loan is based on the principles set by the Central Government and is not Mr. Song's personal action. The Legislative Yuan is responsible to the Central Government. Since this loan is the intention of the Central Government, it is certainly not illegal. I continued to say that this loan will be used for construction and production and will absolutely not be consumed in civil wars. If it can be carefully managed, it will certainly not be wasted. The Legislative Yuan has resolved to organize a Loan Management Committee to prevent waste, and it has now been submitted to the Central Political Conference for adoption.</p>
<p>Economic Conference The London Economic Conference focuses on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and China has less involvement. Recently, the United States has experienced a surplus of agricultural products, low prices, weak purchasing power of farmers and workers, and more than ten million unemployed people. This is the contradiction of capitalism, so the United States has adopted a policy of currency inflation to seek relief. France advocates restoring the gold standard, while the United Kingdom advocates setting a rigid exchange rate first and then restoring the gold standard in the future. Each country has different interests and different opinions. China advocates raising the price of silver and stabilizing the price of silver. Stabilizing the price of silver benefits all countries and is expected to be adopted. Mr. Song is expected to return to the country around the end of July or the beginning of August.</p>
<p>Review of the Draft Constitution Mr. Sun finally stated that the first draft of the Constitution has now been completed and is being reviewed. We have contributed many opinions. It has now been decided to submit the first draft to the subcommittee for review first, then to the Constitution Drafting Committee for discussion, and then to the Legislative Yuan for passage before submitting it to the Central Political Conference for approval. In the future, it will be submitted to the National Assembly for passage in the name of the Central Executive Committee, and the Constitution will be formally established.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yesterday's Salary Increase Movement for Clerks and Staff on the Two Railways <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Authorities Did Not Reply Yesterday</p>
<p>Resolution Expected After Requesting Instructions</p>
<p>The clerks and staff of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have not yet received their annual salary increases for the twenty-second year, and recently there have been rumors that the annual salary increases will be canceled. The clerks and staff of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway specially established the "Representatives' Congress for the Salary Increase Movement for the Twenty-Second Year of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Staff" in Wuxi on the fifteenth. The next day, they telegraphed the authorities, requesting a satisfactory response within forty-eight hours. The clerks and staff of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway also convened a representatives' congress in Jiaxing on the sixteenth, unanimously responding. In addition to telegraphing their sympathy to their colleagues on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, they also telegraphed the authorities for a definite reply. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Responds Acknowledging with respect your telegram from the Wuxi Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Staff Representatives' Congress for the Salary Increase Movement for the Twenty-Second Year. The annual salary increase concerns the vital interests of our colleagues. Having resolved, we express our deep sympathy and earnestly hope that you continue to fight and keep us informed at any time. First Representatives' Congress Presidium, Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Branch Office, bowed, Xian.</p>
<p>Machine Factory Responds Acknowledging with respect the published telegram from Wuxi Station to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Staff Representatives for the Salary Increase Movement for the Twenty-Second Year. We, the colleagues of our factory, vow to provide full assistance and wholeheartedly support it. Sixth Branch of the Wusong Machine Factory Branch Office, Colleagues of the Materials Factory, Qia.</p>
<p>Telegraph Inquiry to the Authorities To the Director and Traffic Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration: The annual salary increase is divided into two periods per year. The first period is about to end, and the second period will follow. We have already submitted a request, but there has been no good news. The masses are anxiously awaiting. What progress has the railway administration made on this issue? Please provide a definite reply to dispel doubts. First Representatives' Congress Presidium, Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Branch Office, bowed, Xian.</p>
<p>Request for Instructions Submitted to the Ministry Regarding the clerks' and staff's request for annual salary increases, the two railway administrations have submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for instructions on how to handle it. Director Huang Boqiao also met with Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu in Shanghai on the fourteenth of this month to request instructions. At the same time, considering the seriousness of the situation, Police Chief Yuan Boyang was dispatched to Beijing by night train on the fifteenth to contact the Ministry of Railways and report on the progress.</p>
<p>Notice to Clerks and Staff Director Huang Boqiao and Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng gathered the heads and deputy heads of the General Affairs, Engineering, Traffic, Materials, Mechanical, and Accounting departments at 2:00 PM on the sixteenth to explain the handling of this matter and instructed them to inform their subordinates that there was no intention to cancel the salary increase. They have already requested instructions from the Ministry. At the same time, they announced to the clerks and staff in the two railways' daily publications, saying, "Regarding the employee salary increase issue this year, this administration has requested the Ministry to give instructions and has dispatched Deputy Director Yuan to the Ministry for contact. An official order will be issued soon."</p>
<p>The Administration's Statement The secretariat of the two railway administrations declared to the Xin Xin News Agency reporters yesterday that Article 5 of the "Regulations on Salary for National Railway Staff" revised and promulgated by the Ministry on May 30th, 1920, stipulates, "The promotion of staff and clerks requires a record of merit from the previous rank or promotion, which can be submitted by the administration to the Minister of Railways for approval to advance one level." This administration has decided to handle it in accordance with the regulations. Since the clerks and staff telegraphed requesting a response within a time limit, the administration has requested instructions from the Ministry and will handle it after the Ministry's order. However, it is hoped that employees will not engage in any unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>Clerks' and Staff's Attitude The total number of employees under the two railway administrations is about 13,000. The annual salary increases for workers in the twenty-second year were implemented in January of this year. There are about 400 clerks and staff in the administrative offices. Since requesting the railway administration to reply within a time limit, Xin Xin News Agency reporters met with clerks and staff of the Traffic Department yesterday. According to them, the 48-hour deadline will expire on the morning of the 18th. Before the deadline expires, the clerks and staff will not express anything for the time being. However, it is hoped that the railway administration will give a satisfactory response to meet the expectations of the public.</p>
<p>Final Solution The reporters from the Guowen News Agency later obtained news from other sources that the salary increase movement representatives telegraphed the authorities to give a satisfactory response within 48 hours, which is due this morning (18th). The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo section established a similar organization yesterday, and there will soon be an expression. As for the final steps if the clerks and staff do not get a satisfactory response, it is heard that because the workers have already been increased, there is no problem. Vehicles will still run as usual, and all the clerks and staff on the railway will implement not selling tickets, allowing guests to ride at will. Although in a slowdown, traffic is still not interrupted. Yesterday, the two railway administrations' party headquarters held a regular meeting and raised a discussion on this, but the content was confidential and unknown.</p>
<p>Extension of Response The Traffic Department clerks and staff of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways requested annual salary increases for the twenty-second year and telegraphed the two railway administrations, requesting a satisfactory response within 48 hours. The railway administration has submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for instructions on how to handle it. According to a certain source, the 48-hour deadline started on the morning of the sixteenth and expires this morning. However, the railway administration believes that it needs to request instructions from the Ministry of Railways, and it is impossible to reply in such a short period due to the exchange of official documents. A special representative was sent to guide the clerks and staff, requesting an extension to Tuesday (20th), and there will be a satisfactory response. The clerks and staff have indicated acceptance and are waiting for a solution. Also, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu returned to Beijing by night train yesterday. When reporters met him on the train, they asked about his attitude towards the railway administration clerks and staff's request for a salary increase. Gu did not want to express anything at that time. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Our country's red and green tea leaves shipped to various African territories reach millions of taels per year. Since Japan began shipping green tea to that area the year before last, it has suddenly increased by two million pounds in three years. It also promoted that Chinese tea contains various toxins and directly dumped tea at low prices to consumers. Not only was the sale of Chinese tea in the Philippines greatly affected, but French merchants in Africa were also panicked. In order to understand whether the tea produced in China is as bad as the Japanese claim, and the intention of the Japanese propaganda in the Philippines, the merchants specially requested the French government to send personnel to China for investigation. The investigation commissioner Goubeaux (Jean Goubeau) dispatched by the French government arrived in Shanghai last month. Goubeaux is a French agricultural engineer and has worked as a tea master at the Annam Agricultural Research Institute for more than ten years. He is very familiar with the tea industry in the East. After arriving in Shanghai, he and Fan Hejun, a translator assigned by the French Consul, went to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and the two lakes to investigate tea-producing areas. After returning to Shanghai a few days ago, he visited Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and Wu Juenong, the tea inspection technician of the bureau, regarding the improvement of the methods of transporting and planting Chinese tea in the Philippines. The two parties discussed it four or five times. According to the person in charge of the inspection bureau, Goubeaux believes that banning colored tea and gathering strength to promote it externally are the fundamental ways to save Chinese tea. When he arrived in Qimen, Anhui, he visited the Anhui Provincial Tea Improvement Farm. He also praised the farm's success in handling sales cooperation this year and its policies on experimental planting methods. In this city, he will visit several tea merchants before planning to go to Japan for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cotton and Grain Industry Association's Opinion on Cotton and Wheat Loans <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Matters Concerning People's Livelihood Should Be Considered Comprehensively</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton and Grain Industry Association submitted a letter to the Central Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, addressed to Director Song. "The news that Minister Song signed a contract in the United States to borrow a huge sum of 50 million for cotton and wheat has shocked the country. We have been reading your speeches in the newspapers for days. The loan contract has been established, and you have prepared measures and submitted them to the Yuan. We admire your comprehensive planning. However, the total amount of the loan is 50 million US dollars, and it is stipulated that four-fifths will be used to purchase cotton and one-fifth to purchase wheat and flour. The contract content, such as procurement prices, shipping, and distribution, is up to Minister Song to consider, which is profound and unpredictable. However, this matter is of great importance and relates to the livelihood of the entire people. The association operates in the cotton industry and is familiar with the situation, and there are several points that we cannot help but speak out. We humbly present them to you, Director. Our country is based on agriculture, and its agricultural products are the best in the world. Only because of endless internal strife and frequent droughts and floods, planting is not timely, and famine often occurs. To save it, we should eliminate private views, unite sincerely, quell internal unrest, rectify agricultural production, and improve planting to enrich people's livelihood. Borrowing money to live is not a long-term plan. This is one. The bankruptcy of agricultural villages affects social stability. In recent years, grain prices have fallen, farmers have abandoned their fields and scattered in all directions. Even suicides in ditches have been reported in newspapers from time to time. The number of vagrants has surged in large cities, which is a great social concern. Revitalizing agricultural villages is an urgent task today. If foreign surplus agricultural products are used to oppress dying farmers, the hope of revival will eventually be in vain. Foreign countries dump their products, and cash is depleted. Major powers promote domestic products, mostly limiting imports. The United States prohibits the import of cotton products, which is clear evidence. However, the dumping continues, coupled with huge loans, which is tantamount to the government becoming a sales agency for foreign merchants, creating opportunities for friendly countries' products, and giving strong neighbors the excuse to import. The leakage is huge, and the national system is concerned. This is two. The total output of domestic cotton is about 8 million dan on average. If we can do our best to promote it and improve it, with our country's suitable land, the yield will definitely increase. According to past output, it is more than enough to supply our country's self-operated yarn factories. Even in the event of a famine, the difference is not much, and manufacturers can purchase it themselves. Moreover, yarn sales have been stagnant to the extreme in recent years. Since hearing the rumors of the huge loan, the market price of cotton yarn has fallen sharply within a week. If a huge amount of foreign cotton is imported, the value of domestic cotton will inevitably be even worse than today. The disadvantages are not only that cotton prices will be cheaper and cotton farmers will be directly harmed, but also that yarn stocks will be thicker and yarn merchants will find it difficult to support. This is four. In the past, yarn manufacturer Rong Zongjing spread the rumor of borrowing cotton from the United States, and the public was panicked and asked to stop it. Since receiving instructions, public doubts have been dispelled. The brilliant instructions, the ink is not dry, the impact of small loans to individuals on society has been extremely significant, let alone those who are more than this. The advantages and disadvantages of this are self-evident. This is five. In summary, based on the evidence of our country's products and the current situation, it seems that there is no need to accept this loan from the United States, whether it is cotton or wheat flour. We humbly ask for your opinion to follow public opinion and withdraw the order. In the event that it is inconvenient to change due to international credibility, the signing of a formal contract must be carefully planned, with the premise that it does not hinder domestic products, and then make suggestions. And beg to approve the line, one cotton price average, cotton is a major domestic product, the people's livelihood concerns, accounting for about five-sixths of the people, American cotton prices should be based on the average of the historical Sino-American cotton prices, two procurement knowledge, about the quality of raw materials, must be familiar with, China and the United States cotton producing areas production, domestic yarn factories' supplies produced in and social needs, take the shared strengths, complement our shortcomings, only in order to make the most of it, use all the amount of three things rare is expensive, the surplus is waste, then shipping should pay special attention to, if you can divide a long time, to the rest of his state, make up for our lack of, supply and demand, perhaps the shortcomings, if in a short period of time, the entire batch is shipped, then supply exceeds demand, cotton prices, the situation is suppressed, must anticipate the lack of real, shipped in batches, no backlog, four distribution issues, is even more important, the newspaper reported that the Minister of Industry said, if the distribution is not its law, then it will not only be of no help to us, that the inherent domestic cotton industry yarn industry will also suffer its extremely bad influence, Zhizai Siyan, sincere and essential, our country's own yarn factories, the total number of eighty-four, the annual cotton, the average per plant to seventy thousand dan, but six million dan, in addition to the application of domestic cotton, the lack of limited, nearly because yarn sales dismal, the implementation of reduced labor, then the required raw materials, more and more reduced, so to distribute this huge amount of American cotton, must recruit sophisticated cotton yarn merchants, the organization of the committee, first find out the number of domestic cotton inventory, each factory lack the exact number, and daily quantity, to consider the use of both, on a scheduled basis to provide, there is no delay, to avoid the lack of concern, the Association operates in various cotton, know the rural life, tied to cotton production to the heavy, for the special dare not venture, to offer humble suggestions, bow to Lan Xie Nian rural decline, cotton merchants difficult, try to take care of, any worship pray, Jin Chenyun</p>

<h3 id="e116">Wang Delin's Department Arsenal Director Yu Junqing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Unit's Anti-Japanese and Russian Retreat Experience</p>
<p>Only by Continuing the Anti-Japanese War Can We Repay the People</p>
<p>Yu Junqing, the director of the arsenal of Wang Delin's troops, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning. A Far East News Agency reporter specially visited him to inquire about the details, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Anti-Japanese Experience) Since the September 18th Incident, Yu Junqing, acting as the director of the Jilin Province, witnessed the humiliation of the invasion by a strong neighbor. Believing that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, he participated in the anti-Japanese work and was entrusted by Commander Wang to serve as the director of the arsenal. After several months of fierce fighting, the strong enemy was frightened. At that time, all the supplies of equipment and bullets were planned by the factory. When the Ma Zhanshan troops lost, our army was threatened, so we had to retreat from Dongning, Jilin to Shuangchengzhi in Russia on January 13th this year (Wang Kong Avoided Russia). An emergency meeting was convened to gather the entire army, and everyone requested that Commanders Wang (Delin) and Kong (Xianrong) enter Russia temporarily to preserve their strength. They set off from Shuangchengzhi on the 24th and arrived in Domsk on March 11th. The subordinate troops were reorganized and remained in Jilin Province, lurking in various places, adopting the Russian guerrilla strategy of the Russian-Japanese War in 1918. On April 14th, they set off from Domsk to Poland.</p>
<p>(Arrived in Poland) They arrived in Bodi on the 19th, and the local overseas Chinese warmly welcomed and comforted them, and gave many gifts. Commander Wang expressed his gratitude and declined. Cheng set off for Berlin on that day, departed from Berlin on the 27th, arrived in Geneva, Italy on the 28th, and arrived in Hong Kong on the 5th of this month on the Sapolikin vehicle.</p>
<p>(Guangdong and Macau Welcomed) When arriving in Hong Kong, more than 3,000 people from various institutions and groups in Guangdong Province and the people of the city welcomed him and firmly invited him to visit the province. Commanders Wang and Kong could not refuse the kindness, and accompanied the representatives of the province to visit the province on the same day.</p>
<p>(Coming to Shanghai Soon) After arriving in the province, they originally planned to stay for a while and then come to Shanghai. Later, because all sectors of Macau sent representatives to welcome them, they could not refuse and stayed in Macau for at most one or two days before returning to Hong Kong and transferring to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Continuing the Anti-Japanese War) I and Senator Xu Jiesan took the Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel on the 12th and came to Shanghai first to take care of everything. Once Commanders Wang and Kong arrive in Shanghai, if there are any other delays, they should go to the front line immediately, lead the troops to continue the anti-Japanese war, recover the lost land, to fulfill their long-cherished wishes, and to repay the people.</p>

<p>Jianghan Customs Cracks Down on River Pilots: After the establishment of the Yangtze River Pilots Association, the Yangtze River pilots currently employed by various ships are required to register with the association and obtain licenses. Otherwise, they are not allowed to practice. However, there are still many unlicensed pilots employed by various river vessels. In order to ensure safe navigation, approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Navy to implement a crackdown on unlicensed "wild chicken" pilots, starting with the Jianghai Customs, which will strictly restrict them. Starting on the 16th of this month, Jianghai Customs specifically issued a notice that all Chinese and foreign ships must submit their pilot's license for verification when departing from Hankou. If the pilot does not have this license, the customs clearance will be immediately stopped, and the ship will not be allowed to depart. After the promulgation of this new regulation, river vessels generally have to rehire licensed pilot personnel. On the first day of the new regulation's promulgation, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua and Jiangjing vessels were departing from Hankou. Although their pilots had licenses, they were in Shanghai and had not brought them with them to Hankou. They were almost prohibited from customs clearance by Jianghan Customs. Only after repeated proof were they allowed to sail. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from Hankou reporting that unlicensed pilots can no longer practice on the Yangtze River, informing various river vessels to replace them as soon as possible, otherwise, it is feared that it will affect the shipping schedule.</p>
<p>Taigu Sends Personnel to Study Navigation: Many graduates from the Wusong Merchant Marine School have been hired by domestic shipping companies as senior officers. Their performance has even surpassed that of foreign officers. In order to save expenses, the British Taigu Steamship Company has recently gradually hired senior Chinese officers for its Yangtze River vessels to replace Westerners. They have also been working very hard in their duties. Now, the Taigu authorities have gone a step further and decided to select personnel to study at the Wusong Merchant Marine School. Fearing that the school will not admit them, they specifically requested to add auditors so that they can be sent to the school to study various navigation subjects together. This matter has been entrusted to our aviation community to discuss with Principal Xu Zufan. Once it is determined, Taigu will immediately send personnel to the school.</p>

<p>Preparing to File Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the case of customs officers Chen Runtai and others being beaten by Japanese people, a reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office yesterday morning to inquire. According to the authorities, Japanese merchants gathered crowds to commit violence and beat members. The office has already received telephone reports. The written report has not yet been received. It should arrive at the office this afternoon. After the detailed report arrives, the facts will be investigated in detail to determine the handling method. If the Japanese people actually gathered crowds to commit violence because they opposed our country's new tariff, it would not only damage the inspection powers of the customs, but also deliberately undermine our country's entire tax revenue. This office will definitely file serious negotiations.</p>

<p>Monthly Rent, Can Still Be Recovered at Any Time</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the two-way Railway Bureau, in order to handle responsible transportation, followed the order of the Ministry of Railways to take back the freight yards and warehouses that were occupied or rented out at the South Gate and South Star stations, first one after another, for future use. Recently, the Xieji Yonghuitong, Dafeng, Anyu, Daji, and Jinqu Paper Industry Guilds at the South Gate, and the Fuyang County Grass Paper Industry Association, and all paper merchants jointly submitted a request, stating that most of the bulk grains and paper goods transported by the South Gate and South Star stations are produced in various townships in Jinqu and Yushanli Mountain in Fuyang. Due to the wind and waves of the Qiantang River, they must be gathered at the two stations and reported in batches. Since the railway bureau took back the freight warehouses, it has been difficult to select and sort them. They requested consideration of the merchants' difficulties and requested that the freight warehouses still be rented out to benefit both parties. After the Traffic Department found that the location of the freight warehouses at the two stations was still spacious and that customers were directly reporting and transporting without congestion, and that if merchants could not rent warehouses, it would also be inconvenient to rent houses outside the warehouses to stack goods. According to the regulations in Section 7 of Article 5 of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line freight car transportation rules, it is permissible to rent them out. The rental price will be revised, and it is stipulated that they will be rented on a monthly basis, so that they can be recovered at any time when the goods are congested.</p>

<p>The truth of the Wei Tingrong case has come to light</p>
<h3 id="e132">Zhao Weishen Declared Not Guilty <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>丨The Garrison Headquarters Announced the Judgment Yesterday丨</p>
<p>Wei Himself Instigated the Kidnappers to Falsely Accuse Zhao Weishen and Was Also Involved</p>
<p>The Truth Was Revealed in the Confessions of the Bandits, and There Are Records Available in the Second Special Court</p>
<p>In the case of Wei Tingrong, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Volunteer Army in the French Concession, who was kidnapped in 1929, five criminals, Cai Weicai, Lü Ruowang, Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang, were successively apprehended. Among them, Zhu, Chen, and Tang were sentenced to five years of imprisonment by the former French Mixed Court. After serving their terms, they were still handed over to the Chinese mainland authorities for further handling. Cai and Lü were sentenced to death by the Second Special District Court in 1931, which was later commuted to life imprisonment by amnesty. However, there was still a suspect in the case, Zhao Weishen, who was identified by the bandits as the mastermind behind the case. Zhao and Wei Tingrong were actually brothers-in-law, both being sons-in-law of the late gentry Zhu Baosan. When Zhao Weishen was accused of being the mastermind of the kidnapping, he was working in the former Ministry of Finance's Revenue Police Corps. The court, considering him to be an active-duty soldier, ordered him to be handed over to the military law office for trial. The police department disagreed and appealed, but the original judgment was upheld. The police department disagreed again and appealed again, but the result of the three trials was still to uphold the original judgment. Therefore, Zhao Weishen was recently transferred to the military law office of the Garrison Headquarters. The military law office immediately opened a court to interrogate Zhao. Zhao vehemently protested his innocence, stating that he had absolutely nothing to do with the case and that he was being falsely accused by the bandits. Therefore, the military law office summoned the four criminals, Zhu, Chen, Tang, and Cai, to confront him. According to the joint confession of Zhu, Cai, and Chen, they had indeed falsely accused Zhao Weishen, and the person who instigated the false accusation was Wei Tingrong. According to Zhu Jingcheng, when he was arrested, he suffered gunshot wounds and was lying in the hospital. Wei Tingrong personally came to the hospital and instructed him to falsely accuse a certain prominent figure and Zhao Weishen as the masterminds. If he was willing to comply, Wei would do his best to find a way to get him acquitted and would also cover his son's education expenses until he graduated from university. At first, Quan Chu did not agree, but then Wei came three more times. Moved by profit and influence, he falsely accused Zhao Weishen. However, in the end, Wei went back on his word and never tried to get him acquitted, merely using him as a tool to take revenge for his personal grudges, which was not worth it. Now, his conscience has awakened, so he is telling the truth according to the circumstances. Recently, Qian Lihe, a rickshaw puller, was also arrested in the case. When the Second Special Court opened the trial after his capture, Zhu had already fully confessed the above situation, and there are records available for verification. The military law office then obtained the records of the confessions of the criminals from the Second Special Court, interrogated them repeatedly, and as a result, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove Zhao Weishen's guilt and declared him not guilty. The full text of the judgment of the Garrison Headquarters is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Copy of the Judgment of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters "Judgment" Defendant Zhao Weishen, 32 years old, from Yanling County, Hunan Province, Battalion Commander of the Independent Sixth Battalion of the Revenue Police Corps of the Ministry of Finance. The above defendant was transferred to this department by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for trial on suspicion of kidnapping and extortion. The judgment is as follows: "Main Text" Zhao Weishen is not guilty. "Facts" On July 24, 1929, a case of Wei Tingrong being kidnapped by bandits occurred on Avenue Edward VII (i.e., Zhubao San Road) in this city. The French police arrested three accomplices, Zhu Jingcheng (Zhu Fengxiang), Chen Zhongheng (i.e., Wang Kui), and Tang Shiliang (i.e., Tang Wenchun), who were sentenced separately by the former French Mixed Court and sent to prison. Later, in 1931, the French police successively arrested two accomplices, Cai Weicai (i.e., Jin Fuming) and Lü Ruowang (i.e., Qian Fangxiang), in this city. Zhao Weishen, a suspect, was arrested in Suzhou and brought to the Shanghai Second Special District Court for trial. After the court's investigation, Lü Ruowang was sentenced to life imprisonment and Cai Weicai was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. Zhao Weishen was deemed to be an active-duty soldier and was sentenced to be tried by military law. At that time, the French police department declared its disagreement with the part of the Zhao Weishen case that was transferred to military jurisdiction and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which rejected the appeal. Subsequently, Zhang Zongru, the prosecutor of the court, declared his disagreement and appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected the appeal on January 7 of this year. Once the case was finalized, the Third Branch of the High Court sent the complete file and the defendant Zhao Weishen to this department. "Reasons" The defendant Zhao Weishen was identified by the plaintiff Wei Tingrong and the French police in August 1931 as the mastermind behind the kidnapping and extortion, and a public prosecution was filed. Later, due to disputes over jurisdiction, an appeal was made to the Supreme Court, which finally decided to transfer the case to this department for trial. After the case was brought for interrogation, the defendant firmly denied participating in the kidnapping. After reviewing the original file of the Second Special District Court, it was found that the plaintiff Wei Tingrong stated in his complaint that the mastermind of the case, Zhao Weishen, was identified by the arrested criminals Cai Weiran (referring to Cai Weicai) and Lü Ruowang, and requested the court to send detectives to investigate. Furthermore, the prosecution document of the French police department on August 21, 1931, stated that Zhao Weishen was identified by the arrested people (referring to Chen Zhongheng and Lü Ruowang) as the mastermind in the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, and requested that he be investigated and dealt with in accordance with Article 371 of the Criminal Law. It is clear that the purpose of the prosecution in this case was to exclusively adopt the statements of Cai, Chen, Lü, etc., as testimonies. Furthermore, after reviewing the trial records of Chen's file on August 28 and November 24 of the same year, no corresponding testimony from Cai Weicai was found. In summary, the testimonies of Lü and Chen are summarized below: ㈠ Lü Ruowang confessed that after Wei was kidnapped, in the seventh lunar month (the exact date is unclear), I went to the Chengzhan Hotel in Hangzhou with Chen Zhongheng and Zou Juen to send a letter, and the Wei family handed over 1,000 yuan. After returning, Zou, Chen, and I went to the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company and met Zhao Weishen. Zou introduced us, saying that Zhao and Wei were brothers-in-law, and that Zhao was the one who kidnapped Wei. He also said that Zhao had said he wanted to kidnap Wei. ㈡ Chen Zhongheng confessed that Zou Juen first asked Lü Ruowang to borrow 200 yuan from me, but he did not repay it when it was due. Soon, Zou and Lü came to my house and invited me to meet Zhao Weishen at the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company. Zhao said at the time that Wei Tingrong was wealthy but unkind, embezzled public funds from the Volunteer Army, and was unrighteous, so he wanted to kidnap him. Four or five days later, I went to Hangzhou to see the exhibition and met my brothers Zou and Lü. Because I had heard about the kidnapping at the Wing On Garden, I was more eager to collect the debt. The next day, Lü invited me to the Chengzhan Hotel to get it, and I heard him negotiate the kidnapping with the Wei family. I left first (the rest is omitted). After carefully examining the above confessions, the times when the criminals met with the defendant do not match. One said it was after returning from Hangzhou, and the other said it was before going to Hangzhou. Which is right and which is wrong cannot be determined. Moreover, both criminals confessed that Zhao said he wanted to kidnap Wei. The meaning of the words proves that he had not yet started to commit the crime, and in fact, the plaintiff had already been kidnapped. Therefore, this testimony is not credible. Moreover, the defendant is an active-duty mid-level military officer and is not foolish. Even if he had criminal intentions, he would never easily talk about it to a friend he had just met. Furthermore, the confessions of Lü and Chen are vague and cannot be regarded as reliable evidence. Since this case was transferred to this department for trial, the plaintiff Wei Tingrong has not been summoned for investigation of the facts. Later, it was reported that he no longer intends to pursue the defendant. Furthermore, the court approved the document sent by the Third Branch of the High Court on May 30, informing us of the recording of the group to the department. After checking, there is a statement by lawyer Fei Xizhen of the Police Department of the French Concession, which briefly stated that the current police department has investigated and found that the defendant Zhao Weishen has no criminal suspicion, and regarding the public prosecution part, they are willing to withdraw the prosecution and request the presiding judge to directly release the defendant. Based on this observation, since the plaintiff has declared that he has abandoned his right to sue, and the original prosecuting agency has requested to withdraw the public prosecution, the foundation of the defendant's crime has been destroyed. It should be considered that the right to sue has been extinguished. Furthermore, after investigating the reasons for the defendant's counterclaim, it was briefly stated that he had a relationship with the plaintiff through marriage, and because they were both running the Volunteer Army in the French Concession, the plaintiff was jealous and did not hesitate to instigate the criminals in his kidnapping case to falsely accuse him. Zhu Jingcheng, Cai Weicai, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang (another person named Lü Ruowang was reportedly sent to Anhui by the court and could not be brought back) were brought to the case for interrogation. According to Zhu, Chen, Cai, etc., Wei Tingrong did teach us to bite Zhao Weishen four times and lured us with candies and other things, promising to reduce our sentences. Furthermore, the Shanghai Second Special District Court sent the original file of Qian Lihe, a suspect recently arrested in this case, to the department. After reviewing the trial record of May 29 of this year, the previous situation confessed by the criminals was recorded in detail. Based on this verification, it can be seen that the defendant's counterclaim is also well-founded. In summary, since the defendant's criminal suspicion is insufficient, a verdict of not guilty should be given in accordance with the provisions of Article 316 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The judgment is as follows: Commander Dai Ji, Military Law Office Director Wang Yizhe, Military Judge Yu Shiyun, Clerk Guo Tingyuan, June 15, 1933, Republic of China</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Supreme Court Ordered a Retrial of the Zhang Wenqing Matricide Case <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Police Department Appealed to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>It Has Been Delayed for Two Years</p>
<p>丨Yesterday, Everyone Changed Their Testimony at the Retrial丨</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, the daughter of the late Huzhou native Zhang Fusheng, who once served as a county magistrate, conspired with Chen Hengcai, the son of her family's female servant Chen Wang, to kill her mother, Zhang Su, because she resented her mother's control over the inheritance. On January 25, 1930, Chen Hengcai, along with his cousin Yao Yonggui and fellow villager Gao Jintang, took a sharp pocket knife from home and went to Zhang's house at 762 Carter Road, stabbing Zhang Su in the neck. Chen and others immediately fled, while Zhang Wenqing reported the robbery to the police afterward. When Zhang Su was sent to the hospital by the police, Zhang Wenqing also went to the hospital under the guise of inspecting, taking the opportunity to take away the deposit certificate of 2,000 taels from the Xingye Bank, the deposit certificate of 400 yuan from the Great World Day and Night Bank, and 45 yuan in cash that Zhang Su was carrying. Later, Zhang Su died of her injuries. After the police found out the truth, they arrested Zhang Wenqing and other men and women and filed a public prosecution for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder. On June 17 of that year, the Shanghai Special District Court sentenced Zhang Wenqing and Chen Hengcai to death for the crime of instigating murder, and Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang to death for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder. The criminals were not satisfied and hired lawyers to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After investigation by the court, except for Chen Hengcai, who was sentenced to death according to the original judgment, the other three, Zhang Wenqing and others, were sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the criminals still expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment of the second instance and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court. Wang Zhennan, the chief prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession believed that the second instance's abandonment of the original death sentence for the three criminals Zhang Wenqing, Yao Yonggui, and Gao Jintang and the change to life imprisonment was too lenient, so they also appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting that the original judgment of the first instance be upheld. This appeal has been going on for two and a half years, and the Supreme Court has not yet announced the final judgment. Therefore, although Zhang Wenqing and others are imprisoned separately in men's and women's prisons, they are still treated as prisoners awaiting trial. However, Yao Yonggui died of illness in prison last year due to ineffective medical treatment. Now, the Supreme Court believes that the judgment of the second instance still has some unclear points and specifically instructed the Second Branch of the High Court, saying that the case has room for investigation in all aspects, and the case is complex. It is difficult to clarify the truth without careful investigation. The original trial was too hasty to be convincing. The original judgment should be revoked and sent back for a new trial. Yesterday morning, Yu Ye, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the Second Branch of the High Court, and Zhao and Jiang, the two judges, and the prosecutor and clerk, went to the First Criminal Court and ordered the three criminals Zhang Wenqing and others to be brought to the case. Gan Jingxian, the lawyer of the Police Department, Wang Chuanbi, Zhang Wenqing's defender, Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng, Chen Hengcai's defender, and Wu Zhiping, Gao Jintang's defender, all appeared in court one after another. The judge questioned the three criminals one by one. Unexpectedly, Zhang Wenqing and others overturned and denied most of the confessions in the first and second trials, denying that they had instigated or conspired to murder Zhang Su. Although they were repeatedly questioned by the court, they all denied it in one voice. After the lawyers debated with each other, the official announced that the case would be sentenced on June 24. Zhang Wenqing and others were still sent back to prison separately.</p>

<p>Tang Was Shot Three Times in Vital Areas</p>
<p>He Died Shortly After Arriving at Baolong Hospital</p>
<p>丨丨An Innocent Passerby Was Killed by a Stray Bullet丨丨</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM this morning, an assassination occurred in front of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, Tibet Road. The deceased was Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo, was 45 years old. He served as the manager of the Great World. He usually went to the Great World to handle matters every night and left around 1:00 AM the next morning. At 1:00 AM this morning, Tang walked out of the Great World, stepped into his Austin car. Just as he sat down and the driver had not yet started the car, gunshots suddenly came from behind the car, shooting into the car. More than ten shots were fired in total. Tang was shot three times, one shot entered from the back of his neck and came out of his chest, one shot entered from his right rib and came out of his left rib, and another shot injured his right leg. At that time, the visitors to the Great World had just dispersed, and the entrance was very crowded. Hearing the gunshots, the crowd scattered and fled. The staff inside the Great World heard the news and immediately took Tang to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in the original car for treatment. Unfortunately, all the injuries were in vital areas, and the treatment was ineffective. He died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Also, when the stray bullets were flying, an innocent passerby was also seriously injured and died on the spot. This person was wearing a white short shirt and black pants. When the reporter received the news, he rushed to Baolong Hospital to inquire. Baker Road was full of cars, all of whom came to see the situation after hearing the news. The family members of Mr. Tang were crying and wailing, which was very tragic. Furthermore, as of 3:00 AM this morning, the Great World was still crowded with people. The pedestrian who was killed by the stray bullet was still lying in the corner of the wall, and the body had not been removed.</p>
<p>[P] Dr. Chen Cheng's Treatment of Rare Diseases is Miraculous</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Cheng, the medical director of Renji Hospital, is very experienced in medicine. Those who seek medical treatment from him will recover quickly. Recently, it was heard that a local man named Yang Gusheng, who is 42 years old, suffered from intestinal pain, and he would often faint and lose consciousness when the pain was severe. This has been going on for 18 years. Mr. Yang was destitute and unable to afford medical treatment. In early April of this year, he went to Renji Hospital and begged for a diagnosis. After examination by Dr. Chen, it was found that he had large intestine adhesion. He immediately performed surgery, removing 88 inches of decaying large and small intestines. After more than two months of treatment, he has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The doctor's surgery is miraculously effective, comparable to the ancient Yu Fu, which is admirable. It is also heard that when Mr. Yang entered the hospital, his body weight was only 92 pounds, but now it has increased to 120 pounds. The picture on the right was taken when he was about to be discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p>They Appoint Six Representatives to Petition in Beijing to Abolish the Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association has convened representatives in Shanghai to hold a joint meeting to oppose the tobacco and alcohol license tax and the newly formulated quota tax, and established the Joint Association of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association. It is now learned that the association has publicly appointed Jin Yunjie, Cao Gexian, Dai Zhuohou, Huang Yuming, Yu Xunlu, and Huang Wenqing to go to Beijing tomorrow to petition for the abolition of the tax, or to reduce the tax rate to reduce the burden. According to a committee member of the association, the tobacco and alcohol license tax has been increasing over the years, which is inconsistent with the regulations of the ministry. In addition, the collecting agencies are inconsistent, and the local wine for both tobacco and alcohol has already been taxed for production and sales. Cigarettes are also subject to a unified tax. The name of the license tax is actually redundant. Now, before the goal of the request is achieved, it has been decided to send the taxes that should be paid to the local chamber of commerce according to the original amount and level of the summer committee this year for temporary preservation, pending resolution. As for the newly established quota tax, the regulations are harsh and cumbersome, similar to the lijin. If implemented, there will be even more disputes. Therefore, the government should be requested to abolish it, and the Suzhou merchants are in trouble.</p>

<p>丨More than 168,000 Flies Were Killed in Ten Days丨</p>
<p>During the summer season, epidemics are prevalent in the fourth district of the county, Sanlintang, Pudong. The district chief, Fu Dianying, believes that flies are the medium for the spread of various epidemics. In order to address the root cause, in addition to working with the local Public Security Bureau to rectify pits and toilets everywhere, he also convened the Farmers' Education Center, various schools, and social education institutions to organize a Fly Eradication Campaign Committee. Because the speed of fly reproduction is extremely alarming, killing a female fly in early summer can reduce tens of millions of flies. The committee formulated a plan and purchased a large number of fly swatters from the district office to distribute to various schools for use. They also sent letters to the district party department, the Public Security Bureau, and the heads of various townships, villages, and neighborhoods, urging them to work together to mobilize the entire population, organize groups to promote, and engage in fly eradication work. More than 168,000 flies were killed in ten days. The best results were achieved by Wuquan, Zuoxin, Xinmin, and San Schools, each of which killed about 30,000 flies. Those who excelled as individuals and groups were given prizes separately. The district is now immersing all the dead flies in kerosene for public incineration.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Letter Extortion Case: Police Request Handwriting Verification <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Wu Ada's Handwriting is Neat</p>
<p>Verification Reveals Matching Numbers</p>
<p>Zhou Asi, Zhang Caigen (also known as A'er), Wu Ada, and others from Tongzhou, colluded with Zhang Weilin, who is at large. Starting from the 13th of last month to the 10th of this month, they repeatedly wrote threatening letters to Sun Yuanyou at 287 Zhaofeng Road, extorting 1,000 yuan. They sent a total of six letters, the last of which included a bullet, and was left near a telegraph pole at the corner of Zhoujiazu Road, covered with stones to avoid being seen. Sun reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives Wang Jinsheng and others to disguise themselves and arrest Zhou Asi and the other two. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the case was adjourned. Defendant Zhou Asi confessed at the police station that he delivered the sixth threatening letter, but the idea originated with Zhang Caigen (who worked as a chauffeur for the victim's family), who discussed it with Zhang Weilin, who is at large, several times. Wu Ada was tasked with writing the six letters, but initially claimed he could not write. After repeated urging, he began to write the text, spanning three large sheets. He deliberately wrote neatly, and upon verification, some numbers matched. The police handwriting expert is currently out of town. The prosecution requests another adjournment to allow the court to have a handwriting expert confirm the writing. The three sheets written by Wu Ada were then submitted for inspection. The victim, Sun Yuanyou, testified that the first letter demanded 1,000 yuan in a peaceful tone, while the second letter threatened kidnapping with a ransom of 200,000 yuan if the demand was not met. The meeting locations were set at the end of North Sichuan Road and Zhoujiazu Road, but no one showed up to negotiate. When questioned, Zhou Asi's testimony was consistent with his police statement. Zhang Caigen and Wu Ada gave evasive answers, constantly shifting blame. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Fire at Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>丨Hai Ning Egg Factory Warehouse on Fire丨</p>
<p>The refrigerated warehouse of York Company, located at No. 13 Xiangyan Bridge, Hujia Wooden Bridge, Zhabei, is owned by American merchant Maddison. It employs over eighty workers. The warehouse consists of eight buildings, with two southern rooms on the upper floor leased to Hai Ning Egg Factory, run by American merchant Haikesheng, as a warehouse. Yesterday morning around five o'clock, a fire suddenly broke out in the Hai Ning Egg Factory warehouse. At that time, it was just dawn, with few pedestrians. All the workers had already finished their shifts, so the fire went unnoticed. Only when the flames broke through the roof did nearby residents wake up from their dreams. They rushed to report to the Third Branch of the Fifth District, who informed the fire brigade. Fire trucks were dispatched to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, by then, the fire had spread from the upper floor to the lower refrigerated warehouse. Moreover, the contents of the refrigeration room were highly flammable, causing the fire to expand rapidly. The firefighters immediately focused on protecting the surrounding buildings while vigorously fighting the fire. It was not until around seven o'clock that the fire was completely extinguished. As a result, the York Company refrigerated warehouse and the Hai Ning Egg Factory warehouse were completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed, but according to neighbors, it may have been caused by a worker dropping a cigarette while carrying goods into the egg factory warehouse.</p>

<p>Why Must Madam Fu Jia Complain?</p>
<p>Another Lawsuit is Inevitable</p>
<p>Fu Maoyun, a resident of Xu Family Residence, Dongshouli, Yangjing Town, Pudong, is a farmer. He has a son named Qiusheng, 22 years old, who works as a shoemaker. In February of this year, he married the younger sister of Yu Miaolin from the neighborhood, and their relationship was very affectionate. However, Fu Miaosheng, a relative who lived in the same house and worked as a small wheel operator, and his wife, Madam Jia, constantly made sarcastic remarks about the bride waking up too late every morning. The bride was not willing to be outdone, and three days ago, they had a verbal altercation. The bride's eloquence was far superior to that of Madam Jia. After losing the verbal battle, Madam Jia told her husband. Miaosheng became even more enraged and gathered five thugs to come to the house and make trouble yesterday at 2 pm, while the bride's parents were out. The bride was terrified to see that one of them was carrying a handgun, so she fled out the back door and reported to the Second Precinct of the Third District. Miaosheng, finding no one in the house, smashed the dressing table and clock in the bridal chamber to pieces before fleeing. After the bride's father and others returned home, they were furious at the scene. They took photos of the damaged items and reported the incident to the police station, demanding that the perpetrators be arrested and investigated.</p>

<p>丨Demonstrating with Washing Pans and Bamboo Brooms丨</p>

He established a sanitation station, with a trial period of one year to observe the results. It officially opened on the ninth of this month, and the first step was to remove private dung pits. However, these private pits were used by farmers for fertilizing their fields. The station's action was closely related to agricultural production. Therefore, the farmers united and protested. The day before yesterday afternoon, when the station's workers were removing pits along Sanjing Street, elderly women and children sounded copper alarms, gathering over a hundred people to cause trouble and prevent the work from proceeding. Many held washing pans and bamboo brooms in protest. A women's army created a formidable presence, appearing ready to use force. Fortunately, police and security team members arrived to quell the unrest, persuading the women to disperse and await a proper resolution.</p>

<p>Dear Chief Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you directly. I read a news item in the Shanghai news column of your newspaper on June 17 entitled "Grey Pill Organs Interrogation Record," which involves the names of several factories. I was shocked to read it. After investigation, our factory has no so-called Pan Linqing, nor are there these two employees, Chen and Jiang, nor is there any sub-lease of Yuxing. This matter concerns the reputation of our business and is likely to confuse the audience. I am writing to ask you to correct it. Sincerely, Nanyang Socks Factory General (South) Office, No. 5 Malu (Nanjing Road), June 17</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Regarding the letter from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stating that the Shen Bao has "then the postal workers union on behalf"</p>
<p>The speaker stood up to declare that after the adoption of this plan to consolidate the postal base, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau must not use new personnel, and the chairman expressed his agreement on the spot, and Tang Baoshu, director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, must express his acceptance." The News reported that "the chairman then declared that after the proposal was passed, the Postal 　Savings and Remittance Bureau must not add any personnel, and Tang Baoshu, director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, expressed his acceptance." After investigation, before the meeting yesterday, the war worker representative did make this statement, but Chairman Wu and Bao Shu did not express any opinions. Although the principle can be agreed, the facts must not be confused. Accordingly, please ask your association to send a letter to the newspapers to correct the situation. This is the reason for this matter, so please check it out and correct it quickly. Sincerely, Postal Economic System Research Committee, June 17</p>

<h3 id="e162">Excerpt from Shenbao Series: On the Current State of Japan, Volume 1 <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Compiled by Chen Binhe, total of 214 pages</p>
<p>32mo paper, actual price 5 copper coins</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts: translation, compilation, and rewriting;</p>
<p>Part One: "Research on Japanese History" is translated and compiled based on the "Materialist View of Japanese History" by the left-leaning Japanese scholar Sano Manabu. Although it only accounts for one-third of the original book in terms of volume, the essence of the original is preserved. The value of this book lies in its focus on the material production relations as the driving force of all social development, unlike the old Japanese historians who distorted history and focused solely on the deeds of heroes, prominent figures, and emperors, thus obscuring the great power of the working masses in history. The original author, Mr. Sano Manabu, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Japanese authorities at the end of last year and is currently in prison. It is said that he came to Shanghai last year and was arrested by the Japanese police just as he was about to disembark. During interrogation at the Tokyo Police Department, he did not say a word, but only wrote six characters on a piece of paper: "A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated." Such a great personality deserves our respect.</p>
<p>Part Two: "Japan in the International Situation" is rewritten based on the materials in the first part of the 17th issue of the "World Economic Yearbook" by Varga (a Hungarian). (Published by the Japan Economic Criticism Society, Sōbun閣, July Showa 7). He is a world-renowned economist. His analysis of Japan in the international situation from an economic perspective is certainly very accurate.</p>
<p>Part Three: "The Expansion of Japan's Military Expenditure and Its Financial Crisis" is translated and compiled based on the materials in the second part of the 11th issue of the "Japan Economic Yearbook" published by the Toyo Keizai Shinposha (published in February Showa 8). This book is a relatively reliable source of economic information in the Japanese publishing industry. It does not shy away from the facts regarding the crisis of Japanese finance today and provides a detailed account, making it highly valuable for reference.</p>

<p>The editor, speaking of the necessity for our countrymen to study the Japanese question, explains in the preface:</p>
<p>"There is a Japanese story that says in ancient times there were two frogs, one living in a well in Kyoto and the other in a lotus pond in Osaka, forty miles apart. One day, they each set out from their home village, planning to explore the strange and unusual things of other places. They finally arrived at a place midway between Kyoto and Osaka, where they both stood firmly on their hind legs, gazing for the first time at the distant foreign land. Unfortunately, the frogs' eyes were located at the back of their heads, so their vision could only see what was behind them. Therefore, apart from seeing the scenery of their own hometowns, the two frogs saw nothing strange or unusual. So they returned to their respective places in a depressed mood. They imagined that Kyoto was a replica of Osaka, and Osaka was a replica of Kyoto. Until now, these two frogs still do not know and do not believe that there is a vast world outside the well and the lotus pond.</p>
<p>"There are similar analogies in ancient Chinese books,"</p>
<p>Zhuangzi writes, "A frog in a well cannot be talked to about the sea, because it is limited by its narrow space." The Biography of Ma Yuan in the Book of the Later Han also says, "Gongsun Shu was an emperor in Shu, and Yuan said to Gui Xiao, 'Ziyang is a frog at the bottom of a well.'" The frog mentioned here is of course used to describe people with narrow vision, self-imposed limitations, and complacency.</p>
<p>"As far as the situation in the last hundred years is concerned, our country may not be immune to the ridicule of being a 'frog in a well'. Although our country has become the target of political and economic aggression by Japanese imperialists, and a victim of Japanese imperialists' maritime and continental policies for decades, we still lack a fundamental understanding of our neighbor across the sea – a most ferocious imperialist. When observing our neighbor across the sea, some people, like those two frogs, are stubbornly using the eyes at the back of their heads to look, while others simply close their eyes and do not look. Therefore, some scholars and literati still hope to this day that our neighbor will quickly awaken and no longer resort to force; some hope that while resisting, there is still room for negotiation? Some offer advice to our neighbor, saying, "It is better to stop the 'total warfare' and instead use conquering our national spirit..."</p>
<p>"The situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense. Isn't it true that the environment no longer allows us to be 'frogs in a well'? Isn't it forcing us to move forward and use the eyes in front to become familiar with our neighbor across the sea?..."</p>
<p>XXXXX</p>
<p>Secondly, the editor's observation of the Sino-Japanese problem believes that there has been a major change in recent years, which is worthy of readers' attention. He said:</p>
<p>"Looking back on the past few years, I cannot say that I have made any research achievements or contributed anything to the country. I am ashamed of this. However, during this time, my observation of the Sino-Japanese problem has undergone a major change; that is, after returning from Japan in the seventeenth year, although on the one hand I was afraid of the thoroughness of Japanese research on various problems in our country, and on the other hand I felt the need for us to quickly study 'Japan', I still harbored the hope of close cooperation between China and Japan. It was not until after inspecting the Northeast in the winter of the nineteenth year that I realized that the Chinese nation, under the aggressive policy of Japanese imperialists, had no way out unless it unfolded the banner of national revolution. All those who loudly advocate 'Sino-Japanese friendship', 'coexistence and co-prosperity', and 'compromise' and 'peace' are just 'frogs in a well'. The outbreak of the September 18th Incident further confirmed the correctness of this observation. Therefore, if we cannot clearly recognize the aggressive policy of Japanese imperialism, we are not worthy of studying Japan, not worthy of being enemies of Japanese imperialism, but can only be slaves of Japanese imperialism. But at the same time, from observing the ideological turmoil within Japan in recent years, we can also see that Japanese imperialism is heading towards its downfall, and a new Japan is coming soon! We are convinced that the Japanese working masses, the every cell that creates a new Japan, will soon bear the new tasks of the new era."</p>

<p>To be held in districts starting from July 1st</p>
<p>Since Yang Lianji became the head of the Department of Education of Anhui Province, he has attached great importance to the examination system. Therefore, the three matters of the joint graduation examination for primary and secondary schools in the province, the preliminary examination for recruits of the Central Military Academy, and the qualification examination for senior and ordinary civil servants have been actively prepared and carried out by Yang since he took office. In addition to the preliminary examination for recruits of the Central Military Academy, which began its first test yesterday, the joint graduation examination for primary and secondary schools is scheduled to be held simultaneously in districts starting from July 1st. Yesterday (the 15th), the Department issued a notice to all schools and bureaus, explaining the significance of the joint examination for primary and secondary schools and encouraging students throughout the province to pay attention to preparation. As for the higher and ordinary qualification examinations, which were originally scheduled to be held in early July, they are now planned to be slightly postponed due to conflicts with the time of the other two examinations.

<p>(Taiyuan Correspondence) The joint examination for middle schools in Shanxi Province, which began on the 10th of this month, was held simultaneously in twelve locations, including Taiyuan, Pingtong, Jincheng, Linfen, Yuncheng, Qixian, Fenyang, Xinxian, Daixian, Datong, and Ningwu.

<p>The situation of the Central University Experimental School is different from that of ordinary primary and secondary schools. The Central University previously submitted a request to be exempted from participating in this year's joint examination in Beijing, and the Ministry of Education has issued an order approving it.

<p>Zhou Fohai, the Director of the Department of Education of Jiangsu Province, has always adhered to the principle of seeking qualitative improvement in secondary education in this province. In addition to promulgating the measures for integrating teaching and discipline and raising the level of middle schools, he has now ordered all responsible personnel, as the semester is coming to an end, to eliminate personal feelings and attach importance to teaching and discipline in the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers of various schools. The original orders are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order 1: It is hereby ordered that the principal of each county-run secondary school is in charge of the school's affairs, and his position is of great importance. If the selection is not correct, it will cause disputes in the whole school and delay the studies of young people. The director of the bureau is in charge of the educational administration of the whole county and is directly responsible for supervising the principals of the secondary schools. He should usually conduct thorough investigations. At the end of the year, he should review the past achievements of the principals in detail and carefully examine them to determine whether to stay or leave. Those who are derelict in their duties should eliminate personal feelings and apply for replacement to emphasize education. The selection of the successor should be cautious, not based on personal opinions, and not controlled by factions, so as to be fair and avoid disputes. In addition to separate orders, this order is urgently issued for the director of the bureau to comply with. This order.</p>
<p>Order 2: Although the selection and employment of teachers and staff in provincial schools has been carried out in accordance with regulations, whether the teaching is legal and whether the service is dutiful after the teachers and staff arrive at the school depends entirely on the principal's careful investigation, judging their merits and demerits, and observing their diligence and laziness as a basis for promotion and demotion. Now that the semester is coming to an end and teachers and staff are being re-hired, if there are teachers and staff in the school who are incompetent or not very responsible, they should be replaced and re-hired, without indulging the feelings of a few people and delaying the studies of many young people. Teachers who are knowledgeable but not responsible for disciplining students, or who are diligent at the beginning but lazy at the end, should also be dismissed to comply with the purpose of integrating teaching and discipline in this department. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for the principal of the school to comply with. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Disputes Arise at the Middle School Joint Examination on the Third Day <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan of the Department of Education issues a statement</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, following the order of the Ministry of Education, is holding a joint graduation examination for primary and secondary schools throughout the city. The middle school part, which has been held in twelve examination halls since the 15th, has been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday was the third day of the middle school joint examination. Unfortunately, disturbances occurred at the first examination hall (Daxia) and the third examination hall (Meizhuan) of the high school. The Education Bureau issued a temporary announcement, suspending the examination in the afternoon in order to investigate thoroughly. It is heard that a meeting of the Joint Examination Committee will be convened today to decide on the date and continue the examination. Regarding this matter, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau is holding this joint examination because it is related to national government orders. I have always adhered to two principles: 1. To be strict and thorough in advance; 2. To be extremely open in the results. Therefore, the appointment of members and examiners has been carefully selected, and the confidentiality of the test questions and printing has been strived for. I can say that I have nothing to be ashamed of. However, there have been many criticisms from the outside world regarding the joint examination method. Before the examination, students from other places came to Shanghai to incite opposition, leading to repeated calls for strikes and boycotts. Fortunately, after negotiations and precautions, nothing happened. Unexpectedly, it was discovered yesterday morning that the composition topic of the high school English subject seemed to have been found out by a small number of students outside. Regardless of whether it is true or not, it must be thoroughly investigated. I immediately sent someone to investigate secretly, and at the same time telephoned the examination halls to temporarily change the two English composition topics. The second examination hall (Shanghai University) and the fourth examination hall (Shanghai Middle School) of the high school followed suit. Unexpectedly, the students in the first and third examination halls were incited by a small number of students with other motives, and the order was disrupted. Students were sent out to incite others, resulting in disturbances in the seventh examination hall of the junior high school of Minli Middle School. At that time, I immediately notified all examination halls that the history and biology subjects for high school in the afternoon, and the history subject for junior high school, could be suspended for the sake of prudence and prevention of fraud. If there was good order, the order should still be maintained, and no other accidents occurred. At present, in the first examination hall (Chengzhong) and the eighth examination hall (Qingxin Girls' Middle School) of the junior high school, all the students participating in the joint examination have completed all the examination items as usual. Other junior high school students are only missing the history subject, and the students with the worst order and the most violent incitement are only from two or three schools, and clues have been found. At 3:00 p.m. today (yesterday), student representatives from Daxia Middle School convened a meeting of student representatives from some middle schools in the school. After 5:00 p.m., more than 100 people gathered and went to the Education Bureau to petition. I sent Commissioner Jiang to meet them and told them three points: 1. The Education Bureau will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly and strictly. Once it is found out, no matter what, it will be punished according to law. 2. The subjects of the middle school joint examination have not been completed. After the Joint Examination Committee identifies a proper method, all unexamined subjects should be continued in accordance with the revised method. 3. If the Education Bureau has organized a joint examination with complete fraud, it will naturally listen to the investigation and handling of the municipal government and the Ministry of Education. The students then dispersed. In short, the joint examination system was originally a new one. I, as the head of the Education Bureau, was ordered to prepare it and tried my best to be cautious. Fortunately, the committee members assisted in the examination with their voluntary hard work, which is very grateful. However, this unfortunate incident occurred in the midst of a hundred precautions, and a small number of students took the opportunity to incite trouble. I feel deeply ashamed of all parties. In addition to separately reporting to the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government and asking for punishment for my dereliction of duty, the joint examination must continue to be carried out strictly. As for any unscrupulous officials who leak the test questions, once they are thoroughly investigated and confirmed, they will be severely punished. However, students who intend to oppose the joint examination, make trouble under the pretext, or have other backgrounds and vainly hope to expand the situation should still be strictly stopped. It is hoped that the principals and teachers of all middle schools will share the responsibility and guide the students on the right track, which is not only a blessing for one person. Some people say that this joint examination is too strict. Students who fail three subjects must repeat the grade, and those who fail one or two subjects must take a make-up examination. If they fail the make-up examination, they cannot be promoted, which inevitably makes students feel difficult. Regarding this point, for the sake of the young people's time, it seems that there is a need for consideration. In my humble opinion, in addition to the main subjects, those who fail three subjects must repeat the grade, and those who fail one or two subjects in the make-up examination should be given special leniency to allow them to temporarily advance to school as special students and re-enter as regular students after passing the make-up examination in the next joint examination, so that both the meaning of the joint examination and the young people's time are taken care of. The Education Bureau submitted a document to the Ministry of Education earlier last month requesting this, and yesterday it received a request for leniency from the principals of various middle schools, which will be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for instructions immediately. The primary school joint examination is still scheduled to be held on the 19th and 20th, and will not be changed.</p>
<p>According to Riri News, since the middle school graduation joint examination was held, yesterday was the third day. Unfortunately, disturbances occurred successively in the two examination halls of Daxia and Meizhuan on this day. The disturbances in Meizhuan seemed not as severe as those in Daxia. A Riri News reporter made a special trip to Daxia Middle School yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to a middle school student taking the joint examination, some people discovered that students from Jianguo Middle School submitted test papers with more than 20 questions within ten minutes, which has aroused suspicion. At the end of the examination on the afternoon of the second day, someone found mimeographed question papers in the examination hall, which were English test questions, "China after Ten Years." On the morning of the third day, the chief examiner Du Gang arrived and issued the topic, which was the same as the mimeographed question paper. The students taking the joint examination immediately became chaotic and questioned Du. Du immediately wrote a notice in white paper with red characters, saying, "It is unfortunate that there has been fraud in the English subject. All English examinations in each examination room should be stopped immediately. Report to the committee chairman for thorough investigation and handling. Notify the students to maintain order." And personally signed by Du. After this incident occurred, some students reported to Mayor Wu by telephone, asking the mayor to come to the school, but no municipal government personnel came until the evening. At that time, the students regarded the mimeographed question paper obtained in advance as important evidence of fraud, so they asked Du to sign it as a letter, and Du also complied. It is found that among the middle schools taking the joint examination in Daxia yesterday, there were students from Daxia, Guanghua, Jianguo, Zhongxi Girls' School, Zhiren Yong, Peiming, Shanghai, China, Huaguo, Guangnan Yang, Model, and Fudan Affiliated Middle School. In addition to this mimeographed question paper, many pieces of paper scattered on the ground were also obtained. After piecing together the pieces of paper one by one, they were also words for filling in sentences. Yesterday afternoon, all middle schools in Shanghai sent student representatives, originally planning to hold a general assembly of middle school student representatives in the classroom of Daxia Middle School, but it was temporarily stopped by the police sent by the Public Security Bureau. The student representatives from each middle school are now secretly discussing and deliberating the method, and the Riri News reporter repeatedly inquired about the meeting place, but they refused to tell. The spokesman also said that when the students became chaotic, Du said that he could change the topic and write it on the blackboard, but the students insisted that they did not want to take the joint examination, so this line of mediation was not expected to be realized.</p>

<p>The Welton Cup tennis final of Aurora University was held yesterday. Chen Chuanzhang defeated Hu Qichang in three straight sets to win the championship. The scores were 6-3, 6-3, and 6-4. A large crowd watched.</p>
<p>Chen and Hu's skills: Chen's shots are harder and more powerful. Several forehand smashes were very exciting. The smash is also okay, but the backhand lacks grip. There are many double faults in the serve. Chen is always in an offensive position throughout the game. Hu Qichang's work is okay, but weakness is his biggest problem. The chop is very effective, but his ball is weak and cannot kill people. The number of wild balls that go out of bounds is uncountable.</p>
<p>Match situation Chen won the first game as soon as he served. After 2-2 and 3-3, Chen won three consecutive games and won the first set 6-3. After each of the second set, Chen took a very advantageous lead of 4-1. Hu fought to 3-4, but still failed 3-6. In the last set, Hu Qichang seemed to be revitalized. 3-0 won three consecutive games.

<p>The Secretariat is the highest authority in the school's administrative affairs. Previously, there were two sections: General Affairs and Registration. The General Affairs Section had documentation, general affairs, printing, medical, and accounting and cashiering groups to handle the affairs under its jurisdiction. The Registration Section was dedicated to handling the resolutions made by the Academic Affairs Meeting, and was responsible for the implementation of academic affairs. Recently, the Registration Section was transferred to the Academic Affairs Committee, and the General Affairs Section was abolished. The original documentation, general affairs, printing, medical (renamed health), and accounting and cashiering groups were expanded into sections to clarify the authority of academic and general affairs and to make the handling procedures more convenient. However, the school's funds have always been extremely tight. The monthly administrative expenses are only more than 5,000 taels, including special, equipment, and experimental expenses. It is naturally difficult to handle affairs, but in the face of difficulties, we try our best to economize and find ways to make things progress gradually. This is due to the effective guidance of the responsible personnel. The current Secretary-General is still Mr. Yang Yufen, and the secretaries are Mr. Zeng Ke Duan and Mr. Bao Shou Kang. The section chiefs of the documentation, general affairs, printing, and health sections are still Mr. Chen Zhongfu, Mr. Bao Shou Kang concurrently, Mr. Chen Qiying and Mr. Tang Feili, and the accounting and cashiering sections are still handled by accountants Xi Yushu and Wang Haifan. The following is a brief description of the important matters handled by each section in the past year.</p>
<p>In terms of documentation, although there are not many staff members, the documents handled through division of labor and cooperation have been quite remarkable. Although the school's regulations are reviewed and revised by the Legal Committee, the Documentation Section is still responsible for collecting and drafting them. The compilation of the list of 21 and 22 years and the organization of archives have all achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>In terms of general affairs, general affairs is the most difficult thing to handle in school administration. The general affairs of our school is particularly difficult due to the difficulty of funding. Only with proper management can we achieve results. For the convenience of work, it is divided into several parts</p>
<p>1. Engineering, since the 128 War, in addition to the important repair projects handled by the post-war consolidation committee, other projects are handled by the engineering. The construction of the school's roads, the cultivation of flowers, the reconstruction of toilets, and the renovation of bathrooms have all achieved very significant results. As for the school's electricity, it was previously supplied by the Zhabei Electric Light Company, which cost more than 1,000 yuan per month, which was not economical. In particular, we strived to conserve other consumption during the summer vacation last year, and operated our own electric light factory, which cost only more than 400 yuan per month including fuel and labor. Because our school is located in a remote township, all drinks must be self-sufficient, so we have self-flowing well equipment, but all the machines and water pipes were destroyed by the enemy during the Shanghai War, so we bought another 10-horsepower diesel engine, and the water pumped out was tested by the Municipal Health Bureau and was extremely hygienic. Also, because the school's area is wide and the various parts are far apart, it is extremely inconvenient to contact each other in case of an accident. The previous telephone was only for external calls, but now all parts of the school are equipped with extensions to save the time of contact and improve the efficiency of handling. 2. Service, the management of all workers in the school is subject to various regulations, which are strictly implemented, and all workers in the school wear uniforms and badges, which are not only neat and tidy on the surface, but also easy to check in practice. As for the treatment of workers, it has been effectively improved, the monthly wages are cleared in advance, and workers' night schools are set up to train them to increase their knowledge and working ability.</p>
<p>3. Purchase, in order to promote domestic goods, all items purchased by general affairs are used as domestic goods as much as possible, and foreign goods are used only when there are no suitable substitutes among domestic goods, and enemy goods are absolutely not used. As for the accounts of various merchants, they are settled monthly and never in arrears.</p>
<p>In addition, the receiving, receiving, and storage departments all follow the regulations, the handling procedures are convenient, and the assessment is simple.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Wu Yan criticizes people from the perspective of their state, called looking at someone's countenance; criticizes people from the perspective of their substance, called someone's raw material. Speaking of countenance, there is praise and derogation; speaking of raw material, there is only derogation and no praise.</p>
<p>Countenance has praise and derogation, for example; if there is a good countenance, there is also a bad countenance; all of which are blessed countenance, clean countenance, good-looking countenance, there is a countenance to do, are all nouns of praise. All of which are called beggar's countenance, dirty countenance, repulsive countenance, frivolous countenance, are all nouns of derogation.</p>
<p>Raw material has only derogation and no praise, for example; there is only bad raw material, no good raw material; all of which are robber's raw material, gangster's raw material, annoying raw material, beggar's raw material, lazy student's raw material, beggar's raw material, troublemaker's raw material, and even stupid raw material, dead raw material, beating raw material, killing raw material, are all nouns of derogation. It can be seen that inside the raw material, you can hardly find a noun of praise.</p>
<p>Other than countenance and raw material, there are also descriptions of people's mouths, faces, eyebrows, faces, most of which are nouns of derogation. For example; raised mouth, drooping face, dull old face, furrowed brow, bitter face.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of people's styles and demeanors, called so-and-so, which are also nouns of derogation. For example; describing people who don't know how to move, called dead style, strange air; describing people who have calmed down, called yin style, strange air. Recent people write yin style, strange air, as yin and yang, strange air, which is really a mistake; changing style to yang, completely makes no sense. If yin style, strange air, can be written as yin and yang, strange air, then, dead style, strange air, can also be written as dead yang, strange air? Since dead yang, strange air, is known not to be a noun, then, yin and yang, strange air, is of course not a noun either, it is necessary to correct the mistake of taking style as yang.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Shaving <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Long Sao</p>
<p>Until recently; a friend gave me a Valet razor. Therefore, the black whiskers and stubble on my lips, which I never liked to decorate, had a tool for eradication. When I was bored, I borrowed its sharpness and used enough means to clear it up without leaving half a root.</p>
<p>Looking at my shiny face, some people would say that I am only about twenty years old. My wife, therefore, often pouts her small red lips, puts her arms around my neck, and is sincerely willing to kiss me, forming a pair of exquisite mouth bottles. The nectar flowing in the bottle will nourish the lonely flowers of life. At that time, I felt comfortable, and my soul grew red wings and flew. A kind of warm love flowed around my whole body, so I thanked the razor, praised the razor, and even understood "the great function of the knife in the world."</p>
<p>As long as there is a knife, everything that you don't want to exist can be removed. Saying it can kill people, suppress bandits, or resist Japan, shaving is just "a small matter."</p>
<p>But because I admired the knife and felt the annoyance of the beard at the same time, I often sharpened the knife to a silver-like shine. Looking in the mirror, I saw how I used my skills to scrape down the unresisting beards one by one, batch by batch. I smiled, and my wife hurried over to stroke my long, soft curly hair.</p>
<p>To retrieve my lost "pride of youth" from this embarrassment, I have no choice but to shave. At first, it was once a week, then once every four or five days. But now, it must be shaved once every two or three days. And the beard is getting thicker and stronger, not as docile as before. I'm afraid the blade will be broken one day? Later, I realized that because I didn't scrape the roots of the beard, it would be resurrected more quickly. There is no other way but to eradicate it fundamentally.</p>
<p>"But the beard is getting more and more after shaving!" My wife said.</p>
<p>So I began to doubt the insufficiency of "the military power of the knife." But seeing that my beard was like a hedgehog, and the shape was terrifying, I regretted that I had been misguided by the "authority of the knife" in the past. But what's the use of regretting it? Thinking of the poem "Wildfires can't burn them out, spring breeze blows them again," it further confirms that "if you want to destroy the long beard, you must cut off its roots." But my friend L, he is used to plucking his beard with silver tongs, but his forehead is still full of blue shadows. Saying this, the beard is something that is bound to grow in physiology, it has a kind of latent energy, and people of mature age have this inevitable annoying embellishment. To suppress it with "the military power of the knife," to eradicate it painfully, how can you guarantee that it will not resist and disappear!</p>
<p>Of course, there is more than one person in the world who shaves, but unfortunately they don't understand this philosophy at all. Therefore, wars are constantly happening everywhere.</p>

<p>，Drink this cup, skip a meal.</p>
<p>Bitterness and joy will never be balanced. Yet, the thirst for drink and the hunger for food are innate since birth, unchangeable. How many struggles aren't driven by hunger and thirst?</p>
<p>Humans are indeed perceptive creatures. In the sweltering heat, there are so many delightful, refreshing, and thirst-quenching delicacies. It's just that, like some people, if drinking a cup means forgoing a meal, wouldn't they humorously drink tap water instead!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Loquat Boats <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Ren</p>
<p>"The trees are lush with jade leaves, the branches stacked with golden orbs." This is a classic verse praising loquats. In mid-summer of May, when the fruits are ripe, a special feature is added to the scenery of the Yuanyang Lake. Small boats, stern to stern, are filled with loquats, moving back and forth in the narrow waterways like butterflies flitting through flowers. The villagers harbor great hope, for their year's harvest hinges on these few days!</p>
<p>The origin of these small boats is ancient and untraceable. They are entirely native to Tangqi Town. Every year, as the loquats ripen, they begin a full-scale mobilization, transporting the fruits earned with their sweat and blood, basket by basket, boat by boat, towards Yuanyang Lake. It is said that Jiaxing is a land of gold, where good prices can be obtained. However, most people believe that the loquats from these boats are cheaper than those sold in the city markets, so they flock to them eagerly!</p>
<p>Tangqi is a small town under the jurisdiction of Hang County, about one hundred and several tens of li away from Jiaxing. The townspeople are simple and honest, and the villagers are diligent in farming. Every household grows loquats, creating the only natural orchard in China. The products are comparable to those of Dongting Mountain, with annual sales of about two to three million yuan. In addition to shipping to major ports such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, Jiaxing is the second largest sales market. Every year, more than a hundred small boats gather inside and outside the city walls. The daily turnover is calculated in thousands of yuan, which is quite impressive. However, the people of Jiaxing have a greater fondness for loquats than anywhere else. "Every household eats loquats," which promotes brisk sales.</p>
<p>The construction of the loquat boats is similar to the yachts on West Lake, but on a smaller scale. In addition to being filled with loquats, a space is set aside for the boatmen to sleep and cook. It takes at least two days to travel from Tangqi to Jiaxing. Therefore, the villagers always go out fully loaded. After arriving at their destination, they work hard day and night. During the peak sales period, a boatload of loquats can be sold out in three or four days. Then, they exchange the money for rice and cloth and return home. This happens once a year, without interruption. Their lives are honest and sacred, worthy of admiration and respect!</p>
<p>Yesterday and today are vastly different. Human affairs are changing, and the national crisis is upon us. The impact has even spread to the sacred loquat boats. This year is very different from the past. Most of the temporary fruit boats from Tangqi Town have stopped moving forward. Even if there are any, they are few in number. It is said that the government, unable to collect taxes elsewhere, has suddenly set its sights on them, charging each boat two yuan for a donation fee, euphemistically called a license fee. Yesterday, I happened to chat with a boatman. He said that in the past, a boat full of loquats could be sold out in at most four or five days, but this year is completely different. Small boats come and go in the river, but no one cares about them, resulting in the spoilage of fresh fruit and great losses. Now is a time of rural economic collapse. The lives of farmers are difficult and arduous, reaching an extreme point. If farmers are further oppressed, the rural economy will never have a chance to recover. Alas! Harsh taxes are more ferocious than tigers," what more can I say.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Banter is not without reason; a dark plot leads to an unexpected outcome; the Western tutor quietly schemes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Madam Jiang shouted out, "Old maiden, what's wrong with you?" She grabbed a fire poker and kept poking at the furnace. "I reckon you've poked it over a hundred times. If you keep poking, you'll break through the furnace." Only then did Guizhi wake up. Thinking to herself, "I must calm down and not show my unease," she smiled and said, "The briquettes are burning too hot and have turned into a lump. I can't break them apart without poking." She quickly added more briquettes and immediately slipped back into her room. Madam Jiang said, "That Miss Huang has been in the backyard for such a long time. I wonder if she'll have lunch with us. Go and see." Guizhi said, "I won't look, I won't bother." Madam Jiang said, "What are you saying? She treated you yesterday, and you won't bother today?" Guizhi said, "I'm not saying I won't entertain her, I'm saying I won't go to the backyard to find her." Madam Jiang said, "If you don't go, I will, or else people will really say we're too unreasonable." As Madam Jiang spoke, she was about to walk toward the backyard. Guizhi ran forward and grabbed her sleeve, saying, "Don't go either." Madam Jiang was surprised and looked at her, asking, "Then why?" Guizhi's face flushed slightly, and a faint smile emerged from the blush. Seeing this, Madam Jiang felt somewhat awkward and said, "Are you saying that they're having a heart-to-heart talk, and we shouldn't interrupt?" Guizhi pouted, "How would I know?" Seeing this, Madam Jiang understood and smiled along. This made Guizhi even more suspicious. Madam Jiang thought that Huang Manying would not be coming for lunch, so she said nothing more. It wasn't until that afternoon that Huang Manying came out smiling and called out from the window, "Granny Yang, I'm going into the city. Sorry to have troubled you." Hearing this, Madam Jiang had to come out to see her off. Seeing Madam Jiang come out, she quickly walked forward. When she reached the gate, she stopped and waited for Madam Jiang to approach. Then, she whispered with a smile, "Old lady, to be honest with you, I came out of the city this time to help you. From the looks of things now, it's generally good. I don't know what you think. Company Commander Guan will probably come to your house in a day or two. When he arrives, just tell him what's on your mind." (103)</p>

<p>Children, entertainment is very important to you. What do you do when you get home from school every day? Many improper games are harmful and useless to you. Don't you find those old-fashioned games monotonous and boring? Here, I offer you some new games. If you follow them and put them into practice, you will find them interesting and beneficial to both your body and mind. Now, take a careful look.</p>
<h3 id="e206">One-Eyed Coin Tapping <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Place a coin on the edge of the table, with half of it sticking out. Ask a person to stand and circle the table, tapping the coin off as they pass. This seems simple, doesn't it? But it's not as easy as it seems. First, they have to close one eye. Second, before tapping the coin, they have to turn around. This makes it difficult, doesn't it? Because closing one eye changes the sense of distance and depth, and turning around slightly shakes the nervous system, making it difficult to see the coin's position accurately. Using the little finger is also more difficult than using the middle or index finger. If there are many people playing, two tables can be put together. Each person runs slowly, two or three steps apart, back and forth. They must not intentionally stop while running. The person who knocks the coin off the most times wins.</p>

<p>This is a very funny game. The purpose is to practice the use of hands and feet and to cultivate composure. When playing, divide into groups of two. Each person uses a handkerchief to cover their eyes. Each person holds a half bowl of tea (or cocoa, etc., as they please) and a teaspoon. The two people stand facing each other, about an arm's length apart. Appoint another person as a witness. After shouting one, two, three, the two people start feeding each other tea with the teaspoon, only allowed to feed it into the other's mouth. Spilling is considered invalid. Each group does the same. The first to finish feeding and spill the least wins. When playing this game, be careful not to rush when feeding. Rushing will make you frantically search for the other person's mouth, causing you to spill and feed it somewhere else. The witness has a great responsibility, which is not to laugh during feeding, otherwise it is easy to cause things like choking.</p>

<p>This is a game of grabbing seats. The method is to prepare several chairs, one less than the number of players. Before playing, each person names a postal address (this can be freely imagined). Everyone who joins the game must remember the addresses. After one person shouts one, two, three, everyone rushes forward to grab a seat, but the attitude must not be barbaric. As a result, one person will not be able to grab a seat. This person becomes the postman. The postman has the duty to deliver the mail. How does he deliver the mail? He can randomly say two of the postal addresses just mentioned. The two people who hear their address stand up immediately and exchange seats. During this exchange, the postman can grab their seats. If he grabs a seat, the remaining person becomes the postman. If he doesn't grab a seat, the original postman remains the postman. The purpose of this game is to practice memory and alert movements.</p>

<p>This method is played by ten people, divided into two teams. Each team is assigned positions: one goalkeeper, two defenders, and forwards, standing at corresponding positions around the table. They lean their heads toward the tabletop and are not allowed to move. After the kickoff, everyone tries their best to blow the ball into the opponent's goal. The ball can be a paper ball or half of a broken ping pong ball. The goals are any objects placed on both sides. In this game, because the positions of both sides are not allowed to move, it is impossible to blow the ball into the opponent's goal with only one person's strength. Therefore, there will be some very clever passing. When playing, pay attention to attacking when the opponent is unprepared and defending against the opponent's attacks. So, it is often possible to score when the opponent's goalkeeper is taking a breath. Adults should not play with children, because their strength is not as good!</p>

<h3 id="e210">Art of the Secondary Clown <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>In some opera troupes in eastern Zhejiang, there is a role called "Second Painted Face," or, translated more elegantly, "Secondary Clown." Unlike the little clown, he does not play the unrestrained playboy, nor the domineering servant of the prime minister's family. He plays the boxing instructor who protects the young master, or the flattering guest of the young master. In short, his status is higher than the little clown, but his character is worse.</p>
<p>The righteous servant is played by an old man, first with remonstrance, and finally with martyrdom; the evil servant is played by a little clown, who only knows how to do evil and ultimately perishes. But the skills of the secondary clown are different. He has a bit of an upper-class appearance, understands some music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and can also play drinking games and solve riddles. But he relies on powerful connections and bullies the common people. When someone is oppressed, he sneers a few times to his heart's content. When someone is framed, he screams and shouts a few times. However, his attitude is not always like this. He usually turns his face around and points out the shortcomings of his young master to the audience under the stage, shaking his head and making a face, saying, "Look at this guy, he's going to be in trouble this time!"</p>
<p>This last trick is the hallmark of the secondary clown. Because he does not have the stupidity of the righteous servant, nor the simplicity of the evil servant, he is a member of the educated class. He knows that what he relies on is an iceberg and cannot last long. He will have to help others in the future, so when he is being fed and sharing the leftovers, he has to pretend that he is not with this noble young master. The plays written by the secondary clowns, of course, do not have this role. Why would he? The plays written by the little clowns, that is, the playboys, also do not have this role, because they only see one side and cannot imagine it. This "Second Painted Face" is a role that the common people have seen through this kind of person, extracted the essence, and created.</p>
<p>As long as there are powerful connections in the world, there will definitely be evil forces. If there are evil forces, there will definitely be secondary clowns, and there will be the art of the secondary clown. We only need to pick up a publication and read it for a week, and we will find that it sometimes hates spring, sometimes praises war, sometimes translates Bernard Shaw's speeches, and sometimes talks about marriage problems; but sometimes it must express dissatisfaction with national affairs with慷慨激昂. This is using the last trick.</p>
<p>This last trick is also to cover up that he is not helping. However, the common people understand and have already made his type appear on the stage.</p>
<h3 id="e211">"Three-Story Building," "Antiques," and Others <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Qiyu</p>
<p>In the past two days, there have been articles by Mr. Da Wu and Hu Qiuyuan in Free Talk about "Three-Story Building" and "Antiques." It so happens that I have also translated this book, so a sense of fear of falling into the same mistakes made me check my translation against the original text. Now that the matter of "Three-Story Building" has been resolved, I only want to talk about "Antiques" and others. I checked and found that the original text here is the word "Bibelo," which, in addition to meaning small ornaments, has the meaning of "MenusofbjecTSbepeudeValeut" (trivial things of little value). Translating it as "an antique" seems inappropriate. However, this overstepping is not on Mr. Hu's part but is actually due to the Japanese translator. Therefore, I also feel the real difficulty of "retranslation," although I also occasionally do retranslations of Russian books.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to "antiques" and other things, and translating "captain" as "capitalist" (see his discussion of Robinson Crusoe) due to carelessness, there are also many omissions and not small errors in the Japanese translation of Ikowitz's book. For example, in the section on Futurism, "VictoredeSamothracre" is translated as "the victory of Shamotras," which is really incomprehensible. The reason is: "Victoire" is the Greek goddess, the daughter of Pallas and Styx, and "VictoirediSamothrace" is a statue of Victoire discovered on the island of Samothrace in 1863. Although Victoire has the meaning of victory, that is only the same as Milkyway having the meaning of "milk road."</p>
<p>Retranslating is not good, but that does not mean that all translations done according to the original text are good. Even my translation of Ikowitz is something to be ashamed of. Also, recently, when reading Mr. Wu Simao's translation of Macha's "History of Western Art" (which is said to be translated directly from Russian), many places are incomprehensible to me no matter how I read them. It was only after comparing them with the Japanese translation that I understood what was going on. And there are also many errors in the annotations of the names in it, such as annotating Chardin as Sargent and annotating Greuze as GroS (see page six of the Kaiming edition), etc.</p>
<p>Although errors are inevitable for people, both retranslating and translating according to the original text are worthy of our efforts as translators.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Sleeping Pill <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Mr. Lang Sun discussed in Free Talk how modern youth are bewildered by the changes in society and history, which led Mr. Cao Juren to write an article entitled "My Bewilderment." Mr. Cao used Li Po's great dream as an example. Li Po slept for twenty years and woke up. Although the world was different and he had become a marginalized person, his despotic and ferocious wife had died. And Mr. Cao, "took a sleeping pill during the May Fourth Movement and spent ten years in a half-dreaming state, and now he suddenly woke up." Opening his eyes, he saw that, like Li Po, the world was different and he had become a very marginalized person, but his despotic and ferocious, heart-stopping "wife" had not died. Therefore, Mr. Cao wanted to take another sleeping pill and sleep for another ten years.</p>
<p>Very good, sleeping pills do exist, but I hope Mr. Cao will swallow it a little slower, wait for me. I am very eager to swallow a sleeping pill!</p>
<p>Probably there are more than just Mr. Cao and I who want to swallow sleeping pills!</p>
<p>There is nothing difficult about swallowing sleeping pills. We can very well sleep for ten or twenty years, "to hell with it." However, if the despotic and ferocious "wife" is still not dead when we wake up in ten or twenty years, does Mr. Cao plan to swallow it again? If Mr. Cao can be sure that the "wife" will definitely die by then, then Mr. Cao, let's do it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I still have a little concern. We cannot be without a "wife," and we advocate free love. Even if that ferocious and despotic "wife" dies during our sleep, when we wake up, a new "wife" will have already been arranged for us. What then? Should we accept it or not?</p>
<p>I am afraid that Mr. Cao will feel bewildered again at that time, and will once again eagerly oppose the new "wife"!</p>
<p>So the problem is not swallowing sleeping pills, but finding a way to immediately leave the current despotic and ferocious wife and seek a happy companion.</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Ning <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wanrong</p>
<p>Such a thin girl! I muttered to myself, watching the swaying back of A Ning, the new maid the Li family across the street had hired.</p>
<p>For a month, I haven't seen her wearing shoes. How strange! Why is there a section of her left toe missing? Whenever she comes back with water, we always worry about her, fearing that she will accidentally fall and get scalded by boiling water. Look, the way she walks, twisting and swaying, is so worrying!</p>
<p>"Sister Ning, be careful! Why don't you wear a pair of socks? At least you should wear a pair of shoes! It's terrible to get scalded by boiling water."</p>
<p>"I'm used to it," she said with a charming smile.</p>
<p>"Why is there a section of your left toe missing?" I asked, looking at her foot in surprise.</p>
<p>"Miss Ying, I'll tell you next time when I have time! Look at all these scars on my body!" A Ning's melancholy gaze was fixed on her left foot, sighing deeply.</p>
<p>She’s always so busy going out to dump garbage, fetching water, taking their young master to school, and washing clothes by the river, that she never has time to tell me why she lost a section of her toe. Gradually, she grew thinner, and new bloodstains were often seen added to the old scars on her face. When asked, she just blushed and remained silent, turning into a petrified girl.</p>
<p>According to Xu Ma, her master's maid, A Ning lost her parents long ago. When she was eight years old, she was taken to her husband's family as a child bride. Every day, she had to cook, wash clothes, weave cloth, and work in the fields, but her in-laws still didn't like her. One night, she quietly sneaked out, but was discovered by her husband halfway, who chased her back, locked her up for a few days, and then sold her to the Li family.</p>
<p>"Why is there a section of her left toe missing?" Xu Ma was just as bewildered as I was.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three or four days passed without seeing A Ning's swaying waist.</p>
<p>"Xu Ma, what's wrong? What's wrong with your A Ning?"</p>
<p>"She's sick, Miss Ying."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with her?"</p>
<p>Xu Ma walked away as if she hadn't heard.</p>
<p>Ten days, twenty days, a month later, there was still no sign of A Ning.</p>
<p>"Xu Ma, what's wrong? Isn't your A Ning's illness getting better yet?" Xu Ma was silent. She looked around, walked closer to me, and said in a low voice, "She's dead. She's been buried for more than twenty days!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" I was stunned. "What did she die of?"</p>
<p>"Hey, Miss Ying, the weather is really nice today!" Xu Ma suddenly raised her voice, followed by a string of dry laughs.</p>
<p>I looked blankly at her face, which couldn't hide her panic. I found that Madam Li across the street was shooting two bright gazes at us from the window. "Xu Ma," she shouted sharply.</p>
<p>The next day, on the top floor, I saw Xu Ma carrying a small bundle and walking away in the morning light.</p>
<p>"Xu Ma," I wanted to shout, but I caught a glimpse of Madam Li across the street staring at me from the window.</p>
<p>"Ha, Miss Ying, how diligent! You're up so early?" she greeted me unnaturally.</p>
<p>Gradually, I understood everything.</p>

<p>— Written by Jule Renaro, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Fishhook (Continued)</p>
<p>Lepic wanted to remove the hook.</p>
<p>"Ah, no! Don't do that!" Lepic's wife shrieked.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fishhook had completely penetrated her finger, one side showing the sharp point, the other the eye.</p>
<p>Lepic squinted at it.</p>
<p>"Damn," he said, "this has to be broken to get it out!"</p>
<p>How could the fishhook be broken! Lepic only needed to use a little force, and before he even grasped her firmly, she jumped up and screamed. Was he digging out her heart and taking her life? And the fishhook was made of extremely sharp steel.</p>
<p>"Then, the flesh has to be cut open," Lepic said.</p>
<p>He put his monocle on his eye, took out a small knife, and began to cut into her finger, but the blade was too dull to cut through. He pressed the knife onto the flesh and cut hard, causing some blood to flow.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!" Lepic's wife cried, making everyone tremble.</p>
<p>"Hurry, Papa!" said the girl, Elestine.</p>
<p>"Just bear with it!" said the older brother, Felix, to his mother.</p>
<p>Lepic lost his patience. The knife cut into the flesh, sawing wildly. Lepic's wife, after softly muttering "Executioner! Executioner!" fortunately fainted.</p>
<p>Lepic seized the opportunity to continue. His face was snow-white, and he cut like a madman, searching in the flesh, and the finger was fine!</p>
<p>While everyone was helping Lepic's wife remove the fishhook, Red Carrot Whiskers did not contribute any effort. When he heard his mother's first scream, he ran away. He sat on the stairs, holding his head in his hands, trying to figure out the cause of this accident. Undoubtedly, it must have been when he swung the fishing rod far away that the hook remained on his back.</p>
<p>"I now know why I couldn't catch any fish later!" he said. He listened to his mother sighing, initially without feeling any sadness. Wasn't it going to be his turn soon to scream like her, and to scream as much as possible, until he was exhausted and hoarse, so that she would realize that she had gotten enough revenge and spare him?</p>
<p>Some neighbors who had run over hearing the screams asked him:</p>
<p>"What exactly happened, Red Carrot Whiskers?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer; he covered his ears, and his auburn head disappeared. The neighbors lined up on the stairs, waiting to hear the news.</p>
<p>Lepic's wife finally came out. She was as pale as a woman who had just given birth. She seemed somewhat proud, as if she had overcome a great danger, and held her carefully bandaged finger in front of her. She had conquered the lingering pain. She smiled at the neighbors who had come to see her, said a few words to reassure them, and then gently said to Red Carrot Whiskers:</p>
<p>"You hurt me, my good boy! I don't blame you; it's not your fault."</p>
<p>She had never spoken to Red Carrot Whiskers in such a tone. He was surprised and raised his head. He saw that his mother's finger was wrapped in cloth and thread, clean, thick, and square, just like a poor child's toy. His dry eyes suddenly filled with tears.</p>
<p>Lepic's wife bent down. She put her elbows forward as usual. But very generously, in front of everyone, she embraced and kissed him. He was baffled. He cried uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Since people have already told you that this is over, I forgive you, why are you still crying! Did you think it was really that terrible?"</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers sobbed even more intensely.</p>
<p>"Isn't this stupid? People will definitely say someone is strangling him," Lepic's wife said to the neighbors who were moved by her kindness.</p>
<p>She handed them the fishhook, letting them examine it curiously. One of them asserted that it was a size eight hook. Slowly, she became eloquent again, and with her silver tongue, she recounted the tragedy to them. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e215">Financial Weekend: Gold Market Steady <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Short Covering Leads to Another Increase of Five Yuan and Three Fen</p>
<p>The gold market remained stable yesterday, mainly because those who had been shorting in recent days hoped that the economic conference would finally provide favorable news. However, with continuous silence, the shorts were unable to grasp the situation, and the price of gold stabilized. Although the decline in overseas silver markets was weak, coupled with the exchange rate trending higher, and stocks and American cotton being unsatisfactory, the mao pan (raw silk market) was relatively low. Guangbang (Guangdong banks) and others sought tiao (refined silk threads). The morning opening was flat. After the opening, except for a brief decline due to HSBC's listing of English parity and American appreciation (exchange arbitrage), it remained stable throughout. Banks had a very good appetite, resulting in another increase compared to the previous day. Reuters reported news that 41 countries had temporarily agreed to a tariff truce during the economic conference. Although this had little impact, the general shorts were unable to grasp the situation. Speculator Wu, rumored to have had a large amount of US dollars transferred by a certain bank at a red-hot price of 97 yuan, is chronicled in the half-day market report below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 914 yuan and 50 fen, the same as the previous closing. Goods opened at 5 yuan and 2 jiao. The exchange market had little fluctuation at the beginning. The near-term selling price was calculated as 1 shilling 3 pence 375 for English exchange, and 26 yuan 125 for American exchange. It was then changed to 3125 and 0625 due to the gold market situation. Yuanmao, Zhaofeng, Changxiang, and Hexing all advanced. Hengxing, Daxing, and Yongze sold, but with a more stable sentiment. Huabi transferred September US dollars at half a yuan, and gradually rose from 4 yuan 3 jiao. Mitsui also ate October US dollars at 625. Fuyu and Yuanheng bought even more. Mitsui then took back September dollars at only 4375, and it hovered and rose to 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Yuanmao, Yongda, and Decheng took the opportunity to sell at high prices. The prediction was that HSBC's listing would show English parity and American appreciation by 25, and the market would trend downward. Mitsubishi came out with July US dollars at 0625. At this time, it hovered around 6 yuan. Yuanheng and Fuchang advanced to 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengxing came to sell, still declining. Wanxing and Hengxing suddenly came to take delivery, breaking the stagnation and creating a rising trend. McCallum took September US dollars at 375, and it rose to 20 yuan and 05 jiao. Hengxing sold sharply after advancing. Yuanxing and Yongxian also sold. The exchange market was also flat, still retreating to within 19 yuan. Huabi sold June US dollars to Zhejiang at 6 yuan. Hengyu came to the market to sell. Broken lots were also unable to hold and sold one after another, retreating to 16 yuan. Mitsui successively transferred October dollars at 625 and September dollars at 375. Yuankang and Xiangjin offered terms, pulling up 2 yuan. Mitsui continued to take in October US dollars at 5625. Daxing, Yongrichang, and Yuanchun competed to buy, once reaching 20 yuan, but the noon closing was 919 yuan and 8 jiao. After the closing, sentiment remained stable. Yongfeng and others slightly purchased, finding it difficult to find sellers, and it rose to around 23 yuan. Goods were then auctioned at 22 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price in the half-day was 920 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest was 914 yuan and 3 jiao, with a fluctuation of 6 yuan and 3 jiao. As a result, it rose another 5 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The announced price, due to HSBC's listing of the US dollar at 25, was 25 yuan and 5 jiao, equivalent to a standard gold price of over 941 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 21 yuan lower, about 15 yuan less than the previous closing. The current month's account was 942 yuan, July was 930 yuan, and August was 920 yuan. The morning water supplement was 942 yuan. The red-hot price was 97 yuan. Actual transactions were at 100 yuan. Only 70 taels were sold by Yingfeng and Heng to the silver shops in the market. Swap transactions were quite quiet. July and August were priced at about 10 yuan and 5 jiao. In the market, Chunyuan and Yong offered 35 tiao to Dalian Bang Shunli at 10 yuan and 5 jiao. Fuyu offered 21 tiao to Dalian Bang Wanxing at 11 yuan. There were still 4,585 June tiao remaining and 3,934 July tiao.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was not enthusiastic, with buyers being more eager. In summary, Yuankang, Xiang, Yuanchun, Yuanheng, Fuyu, Yuanmao, Daxing, Yong, Zhaofeng, Chang, and others advanced. Hengxing, Wanxing, Yuanxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongyi, Feng, Yongda, Decheng, and Hengyu sold. Dalian Bang Shunli advanced while Wanxing sold. Guangbang Hengxing was also on the selling side. Qianchang, Xiang, Yuanheng, and Wanxing advanced first and then sold. Daxing, Yong, Yuanmao, and Yong sold first and then advanced. The number of August chouma (counterfeit notes) was 18,655 tiao.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Bank Appetite Strong, English and American Exchange Process Remains Tight <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London’s long-term bills fell 3125 both near and far, and American silver shrank by 25. The English and American exchange rate rose by 1.625 points, and the American and English exchange rate rose even further by 5.25 points. The forward silver price fell by over 1%. American cotton rebounded by over 20 pounds. Private dispatches also fell slightly. At the opening of the exchange market, English was flat and American was strong. The near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 3 pence 375 for English exchange and 26 yuan 125 for American exchange. These were then changed to 3125 and 0625. After the opening, banks had a better appetite. Although it briefly became stronger due to HSBC listing English parity and American appreciation by 25, it ultimately remained tight. It was rumored that speculator Wu had a large amount of American dollars transferred by a certain bank, and the situation remained consistently favorable. The noon closing near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 3 pence 25 for English exchange and 25 yuan 9375 for American exchange, with English tightening by 125 and American tightening by less than 125 compared to the previous closing. In the banking sector, Mitsui, McCallum, and Huabi were the most eager buyers, while Datong was blocking. The same was true in the gold industry, but the amounts were not large. The half-day transaction record is shown below.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, the near-term selling price for English exchange was 1 shilling 3 pence 375 or 3125. The gold industry traded September at half a penny. HSBC came out with June at 375. Zhongfu ate September at 4375. The noon closing bid price ranged from 1 shilling 3 pence 25 to 4375, with the purchase price increasing by 0625.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, the near-term selling price for American exchange was 26 yuan 125, then 0625. Huabi transferred September at half a yuan. Mitsui ate October at 625. Shanghai and Mitsui both took in September at 4375. Datong sold July at 125 to Huabi, and Shanghai the same month at 0625. Mitsubishi also sold the same month at the same price. McCallum and Huabi both transferred October at 625. Mitsui sold September at 375 and took in October at 5625. McCallum ate September at 375. Huabi sold June at 6 yuan to Zhejiang. Mitsui successively took in October at 625 and September at 375. Before long, it took in October at 5625 again. The noon closing selling prices for June and July were 25 yuan 9375, August was 26 yuan 125, September was 3125, and October was half a yuan. The purchase price increased by 062-125.</p>
<h3 id="e217">London Large Bills Reported to Shrink <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 17th reported that large bills shrank again. The near-term closing was 19 pence 0625, and the far-term was 19 pence 125, each shrinking by 1875 compared to the previous day. Also, the English-American exchange rate was 4 yuan 01 fen 25.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Financial Market on the Weekend is Dull <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>As yesterday was Saturday, banks were closed in the afternoon as usual, and the market was desolate, which goes without saying. The market price for foreign money lending remained at its old price, calculated at 8 fen in the morning and noon markets. Head-scratching (charging interest on short-term loans) was even more rampant, amounting to white scratching (no additional water). Money shops also did not collect and deliver as usual, only having slight inflows and outflows. In terms of bill trading, the early market had over 4.7 million in transfers, over 700,000 in new transactions, and over 600,000 in afternoon transactions. The Small General Association had over 500,000 in transactions, foreign pawn transactions had over 900,000, and banknote inflows and outflows had over 1.1 million. Banks collected and delivered over 1.4 million in foreign business ticket money, over 1.3 million in foreign money, over 3.34 million in various goods and exchange pledge collections, over 3.1 million in foreign money, over 1.2 million in special collections, over 1 million in settlement collections, and 400,000 in warehouse departures. Chinese commercial banks collected and delivered over 2.4 million in ticket money, over 4.34 million in various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous collections, over 2.1 million in special collections, over 1.8 million in settlement collections, and 400,000 in warehouse departures. Japanese commercial banks had over 700,000 in foreign money deposited in warehouses. Money shops collected over 37 million in foreign public lists, over 5.2 million in foreign head-scratching money, and over 400,000 in various route exchange money. Direct collection of current money. Also, the total number of exchanges in this city on the 17th was 4,536,719 yuan and 09 fen in silver dollars, including 1,821,905 yuan and 2 jiao 2 fen in silver dollars and 2,714,813 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen in exchange transfers of silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Most Auxiliary Coins Were Peaceful <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins changed by one yuan compared to the previous day, calculated at 853 yuan. The morning and noon markets were also the same, with transactions made. The morning market had 8,000 jiao, and the afternoon market had no market. Guangdong small foreign coins were the same as the previous afternoon in the morning market, calculated at 772 yuan and 5 jiao. There were also no changes in the afternoon market, with transactions made. The morning market had 60,000 jiao, and the afternoon market had 10,000 jiao. Copper coins shrank by 1,000 wen, to 316,500 wen, with over 42,700 strings of transactions made.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Securities and Public Bonds 交 Clearing Hover <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Only Whole Land Rises by Three or Four 角</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange experienced even more hovering in the market, leading to even clearer transactions. It was because although the bulls wanted to emerge, they were unwilling to reduce prices for sale. Although the bears wanted to cover, they were unwilling to raise prices. The two sides held each other back, resulting in a situation with no rise or fall. Looking at the overall trend, the bulls were relatively weaker. The bears took advantage of the bulls' slow emergence to cover their positions, and the two sides insisted on a difference of five points in the market price for a long time, making the market even more sluggish. The coming change was brewing in this situation. If there were no special changes in the environment, the market price would not undergo drastic changes for a while. Yesterday's prices had almost no rise or fall to speak of. Generally, bulls in numbers 11 and 50 emerged slightly, and bears in numbers 14, 35, and 59 covered slightly, but none of them were in a hurry, maintaining a state of approaching and separating. Each of the two morning and afternoon sessions had both rises and falls, and each only fluctuated by one or two jiao. Therefore, the result was that only whole land rose by three or four jiao, and other types rose by one or two jiao. Two types even fell by one jiao. The chaos and stagnation of the situation meant that changes were still brewing. The total transaction volume was 7,300,075 yuan, including 7,500 yuan in spot goods. Futures were dominated by the salt tax, accounting for 2,865,000 yuan, demobilization accounted for 1,170,000 yuan, the 19th Customs Good accounted for 720,000 yuan, the 20th Roll 20th Customs Good accounted for 1,210,000 yuan, and the 96th still had 540,000 yuan. The rest were only tens of thousands to over 200,000.</p>
<h3 id="e221">New York Stock Market Recovers After Fatigue <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Company on the New York stock market on Friday (the 16th) stated that the decline continued in the morning, but because the government decided to abandon its policy of stabilizing the US dollar at the World Economic Conference, it was generally seen as a precursor to currency inflation. Therefore, the market rebounded strongly at the closing. The total transaction volume for the day was 5,710,000 shares. The 60-day lending rate was 0.75%, and the 90-day rate was 1.5%. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing price compared to the previous day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 89.22 up 0.35</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 41.17 down 0.24</p>

<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the situation is softening. Although American cotton has risen, it has failed to excite the people. This is because the current sales of yarn are too thin, and the amount of bottom goods is increasing daily. Therefore, the sellers have a strong mental attitude. However, factories are increasingly suffering from the high cost of raw materials, and some are proposing to reduce labor.</p>
<p>(Renbiao (a brand of cotton yarn) Falls Again by Four or Five Jiao) At the opening of the Renbiao market in the morning, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and sellers continued to sell additional lots. Therefore, the market was very weak, with each month falling by three, four, and six jiao. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their positions, and the market trend was firm, with each month being flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,700 bales. It was found that Yuan Da sold 1,000 bales, Tongji 2,000 bales, Rongxing 1,400 bales, Yongda 1,100 bales, Lichang 900 bales, and Changfeng 900 bales. Chunji bought 1,000 bales, Jifeng 1,100 bales, Shenji 1,450 bales, Renfeng 4,000 bales, and Tonghe 2,600 bales. The closing prices were as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is quiet, but American cotton has rebounded by two, three, and ten pounds, and the people's minds are slightly tight. However, the yarn market is weak, and factories are very sluggish in their interest in raw materials. However, the bulls are holding on tightly because of the lack of old cotton. The market situation is higher than the yarn market. It is said that in the afternoon, a proposal to reduce planting in the US cotton field was passed, and the far-month market was slightly firmer.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao (another brand of cotton) Has No Significant Movement) At the opening of the Zheng Biao market in the morning, the market was slightly tighter due to the high rebound of American cotton. The second and third sessions fell again. As a result, each month rose or fell by five fen to one jiao. The afternoon was flat, with the far month rising by five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 55,000 dan. It was found that Chunji sold 3,400 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan, Mingde 1,100 dan, and Yuda 900 dan. Long bought 1,000 dan, Chang 1,000 dan, 1,000 dan, Feng 2,000 dan, and Yuchang 2,200 dan. The closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Gains/Losses Inventory October 4520 down 0, 132,700</p>

<p>August 4670 up 0172,900</p>
<p>(Factories Are Paused) Spot cotton business is paused. The source is estimated at 100 bales of Yao flower. 45 and a half taels of opened Huo Ji flower were sold, and 400 bales were sent to the factory from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Increased New Cotton Fields in Shanghai and Hankou <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from a certain foreign company, the first cotton crop report for Shanghai and Hankou this year stated that the price of rice in Shanghai last year was 7.5 yuan per 100 jin, and it has fallen by another 18% this year. Stimulated by the high price of foreign cotton, the average cotton field area may increase by 10%. Early planting began around the 10th of last month. Because the temperature was lower than usual, development will be delayed by about ten days. In Hankou, when sowing last year, bandits were rampant. However, this year, except for the two cotton-producing areas of Jiaxiang and Laohekou in Henan Province, everything is very peaceful. It is generally hoped that the cotton field area will increase daily, but it is difficult to obtain accurate figures. There have been many rainy scenes recently.</p>
<h3 id="e225">American Cotton Rebounds by Twenty or Thirty Pounds <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was mixed. Wall Street buying and reactive buying led to a rise. As a result, spot prices rose by thirty pounds, and futures rose by nineteen to twenty-eight pounds. Spot prices in the Liverpool cotton market fell by fifteen points, and futures fell by five to seven points. Egyptian cotton fell by eighteen points. The Bombay cotton market was firm at first due to short covering, but fell later due to bull closing. As a result, Pingjiaer fell by six rupees and seven and a half jiao, Aomula fell by nine rupees and two and a half jiao, and Bairoxi fell by seven rupees and seven and a half jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 16th):</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 16th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the sentiment in the cotton market was quite inconsistent, as everyone seemed to be waiting for Washington's announcement to reduce cotton fields. The actual position turned loose due to large-scale resale or liquidation by brokers. Moreover, the good weather and smooth progress of the new cotton easily stirred up a reaction. The procedure for collecting the tax on domestic sales, as stipulated in the Rural Relief Act, which is used to reduce cotton fields and cotton production, led to unsettled minds, arousing resistance and public opinion. It is reported that the price of cotton owned by the Red Cross has been fixed. There is no pressure to sell spot goods in the South, and reporters are quite confident. According to the expectations of several experts, the private cotton production is estimated to be 13,500,000 to 14,000,000 bales. At the same time, changes in production will depend on how the cotton field reduction plan is implemented.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was numbers 40 and 50. The market situation remained sluggish. This street's route was narrow. The thick粳(japonica rice) market price from the Chang Bang, Su Tong Bang, and Nan Gang was difficult to sustain. The high-quality rice was trimmed at a foot, while the middle-quality rice reached as much as two jiao. The stale rice was rarely asked about. The scene of decline and exhaustion was hard to describe. The Baowei Northern ocean Bang adopted thin rice even though there were more than 2,000 packages, but because the Hakka family saw the popular sentiment was weak, they took the opportunity to cut prices, resulting in a depreciation of jiao. This was due to climate control, not human effort. Du Yangjian also showed weakness. The Bian Yuan was slightly tired by a few points. The Yin Yuan was still in the market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Although the source from all routes was not strong, only fourteen or fifteen ships, the white粳(japonica rice) market was very quiet, and the market shape was also small by one jiao. The early thin arrival continued, and those who were picked fresh sold slightly, but middle-quality rice was stagnant, and the market shape was highly softened. In addition to the middle-quality small jiao, Yang Jian (a type of rice) arrived with little sales activity, and the price shape was fixed. Du Bu Kejian was also close to a small jiao, with a fatigued Bian Bai Yuan (a type of rice).</p>

<p>[The Quwei (taste) from Min (Fujian) and Wen Tai (Wenzhou and Taizhou) are All Very Good]</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian (a type of rice) market price, high and secondary quality, all carried a sweet three to five points, because the Fuzhou Bang and Wen Tai Bang were very greedy in buying and the recent arrival was not much, and the market was upward-trending, the market tended to be ang. The Fuzhou Bang coveted Hunan coarse red rice, and the market reached two less. Yesterday, 1,000 packs were searched, and the price suddenly rose from one jiao to one jiao and seven points, because the opening price the day before was seven yuan and one jiao, yesterday it was from seven yuan and two jiao to two jiao and seven points, and all other rice also carried a sweet. All day Fuzhou bought 290 bags of Jiangxi rice, 686 (unit missing) Hunan rice, and 1,300 bags of coarse red rice, 127 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice, and 805 bags of Nanling coarse rice and Yangjian Ji Xian (type of rice) to Wenzhou. In the latter market, the situation is still optimistic because the inquiries from Zhe's (Zhejiang) taste are very greedy.</p>

<p>丨Two Yuan, Three Jiao, Three Fen丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for each month continued to show a downward trend. Foreign wheat quotations fell by two to three jiao. The weather was still favorable, and new wheat from various regions continued to arrive in abundance. Factories, with large reserves of foreign wheat, even if they bought new wheat, would inevitably gradually sell it off. Under these circumstances, both internal and external buyers rushed to sell, and factories continued to dump, causing prices for all months to decline. By the afternoon opening, near and distant futures fell sharply again. As the quantity of dumping from large factories increased, many buyers also rushed to sell. (According to Tianjin buyers, recent purchases were willing to sell smoothly). Furthermore, distant futures experienced even greater price drops due to the scarcity of buyers. This month's price fell to a low of two yuan, three jiao, three fen, a new record in ten years. Based on the current environment, it is feared that there will inevitably be new, exceptionally low prices. As a result, this month's price fell another two fen compared to the previous day. July and August fell two fen and two and a half li. September fell two fen and seven and a half li. October fell two fen and a half. November fell two fen and two and a half li.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market also showed a uniform downward trend. Due to the continued favorable weather, new goods from both Jiangnan and Jiangbei continued to flood the market, and shipments from the river continued uninterrupted. Goods from nearby areas were all considering shipping to Shanghai for sale. However, the attitude of the factories was not to intentionally cut prices, but because they still had a lot of foreign wheat and limited capacity. Therefore, the standards were severely impacted. Customers selling to hedge were still very active, leading to repeated new low prices for each month. August fell below the four-yuan mark again. As a result of the closing, July fell another three fen, August, September, and October fell four fen, and November fell six fen. The current wheat market remains weak, and arrivals continue to increase.</p>

<p>Jiao, two fen. Guangzhou eight jiao and a half. Wheat three yuan and six jiao. Kunshan three yuan, eight jiao, two fen. Secondary grade up to seven jiao. Wheat from Shashi also began shipping to Shanghai for the first time, opening at three yuan, eight jiao, and a half. The wheat quality was still high, with a total of over two thousand packages, of which Fuxin took one thousand, and the rest was handled by Fufeng and Huafeng.</p>

<p>Farmers Face Double Hardship of Bumper Harvest and Famine... The Economy Has No Way to Recover</p>
<p>This successful U.S. cotton and wheat loan occurred just as the new wheat was being harvested. According to industry insiders, this year's wheat harvest is better than in previous years, and this year's new wheat can supply various flour factories for about eight months. The shortage is about four months of raw materials. However, before the new wheat came on the market, there was suddenly this move, which made the farmers feel like they had heard bad news. This can be seen in the Shanghai futures flour and wheat prices before and after the U.S. cotton and wheat loan (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>(Flour Market Prices) (Wheat Market Prices)</p>
<p>Before Announcement June 17th Before Announcement June 17th</p>
<p>June 2.4550 2.3300 4.17 3.86</p>

<p>November 2.5900 2.4225 4.68 4.23</p>
<p>The flour and wheat market prices saw a decline immediately after the news of the U.S. wheat loan was established. Until yesterday (June 17), the lowest price in ten years was discovered. The situation in Shanghai is like this, and the wheat-producing areas in the interior are even more unspeakable. Roughly estimated, the average price per dan has fallen by one yuan and two or three jiao compared to 1932, and the average price is two yuan and four or five jiao lower than in 1931. The market prices reported from the producing areas are listed on the left, and they are still from a few days ago:</p>
<p>Changshu and Wuxi wheat: four yuan, three jiao, four fen per stone (130 catties)</p>
<p>Nanjing Pukou wheat: four yuan, one jiao per stone (125 catties)</p>
<p>Wuhu wheat: four yuan per stone (130 catties)</p>
<p>Yangzhou wheat: four yuan, five jiao, six fen per stone (148 catties)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Danyang wheat: four yuan, two jiao, three fen per stone (144 catties)</p>
<p>Suzhou wheat: four yuan, five jiao per stone (136 catties)</p>
<p>According to someone's calculation, the current market prices for foreign wheat in various places are mostly lower than American wheat. Based on the current price, American wheat costs 7 yuan in national currency per 100 catties in Shanghai. Australian wheat costs about 5 yuan and 8 jiao per 100 catties in Shanghai. Canadian wheat costs 5 yuan and 7 jiao per 100 catties in Shanghai. Therefore, if wheat is purchased from Canada and Australia, 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen can be saved per 100 catties. If 400,000 tons are purchased, 7.5 million yuan in national currency can be saved. Now, farmers are suffering from the hardship of both bumper harvests and famine, and there is no hope of recovery. If we don't think about remedies, the commerce between farmers and merchants will be trapped, and the crisis will deepen. (Guang)</p>

<p>Soybean cake sales are thin, and market transactions are mostly small trades by merchants. Yesterday, the market price for 500 catties of Niuzhuang black soybean cake was still the original price. Factory cake opened at 5,500 pieces, with the school price dropping by one yuan and six jiao and two fen.</p>

<p>(Yellow and White Factory Silk Exports to France Not Smooth) The French postal ship "Isle" exported yesterday. Local Xinfu, Dachang, and other companies exported a total of 273 pieces of yellow and white factory silk to Marseille, for transshipment to Lyon and other ports.</p>
<p>(No Improvement in Artificial Silk Sales) Yesterday, the artificial silk market in Shanghai remained sluggish. Because the exchange rate fluctuated sharply, buyers observed cautiously. Yesterday, only local silk factories shipped 22 cases of Red Bell, Samsung, and Golden Deer brands of June spot goods, with prices ranging from 175 yuan, 7 jiao, and a half to 174 yuan, 2 jiao, and a half, net.</p>
<p>(Overseas Silk Prices Fluctuate) Due to exchange rate fluctuations, overseas raw silk market prices fluctuated. European and American hoarders were very manipulative, thinking of taking the opportunity to buy and sell, while Chinese silk merchants were more cautious. Yesterday, only Dachang and others imported 30 packages of white factory silk to Shanghai, and Zhonghe imported 10 packages of gray silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi and other places was favored by Jardine Matheson and other firms, and sources from various regions surged, making the market more lively. The total number of green tea sold in the city was more than 2,400 boxes, and the prices all trended firmly. Mei and other grades were also sold very briskly, but the trade in low-grade Zhenmei from Wenzhou Yushan Tuzhuang and other places was still deserted. Currently, high-grade green tea has a slight advantage in the market. Yesterday, the market price for Keemun black tea from Yingde was rising due to the opening of the Keemun tea market in London, England, and merchants were making a slight profit. However, Chinese merchants insisted on [whitespace in original], and there was no hope of a rebound in the market.</p>

<p>Recently, the galvanized iron market has been quite good. Buyers from such places as along the Yangtze River Road of Su, Wu, Hunan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Anqing, and Jiujiang have been making purchases. In addition, there is also movement in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, resulting in a lot of transactions and higher prices. In recent years, the construction industry on this street has been very active, and sales prices are tending to rise. Yesterday, the opening price of seven-foot Red Bird brand was one yuan, four jiao, and a half per sheet, six-foot was one yuan, two jiao, three fen, miscellaneous brands seven-foot was one yuan, four jiao, three fen, six-foot was one yuan, two jiao. Thick gauges, such as No. 28, cost 17 yuan, 5 jiao, No. 26 was 16 yuan, 6 jiao, No. 24 was 16 yuan (British goods). American goods such as 48-gauge were 21 yuan, 38-gauge were 22 yuan, 5 jiao, No. 26 was 12 yuan, No. 24 was 21 yuan, 8 jiao, all one or two jiao better than before.</p>

<p>Recently, new arrivals of British steel plates have been very congested, causing the wharves to be overloaded. Fortunately, the sales channels are smooth, so industry players are not very panic. However, the recent rise in the U.S. exchange rate has stimulated the market sentiment, and opening prices have been gradually lowered. Currently, the market price for 2.5% per dan is 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 3 fen, and a half. 0.5% is 8 yuan, 3 jiao, 7.5% is 7 yuan, 9 jiao, 1% is 8 yuan, and above 1.5% is estimated at 7 yuan, 7 jiao, and a half. As for transactions, buyers from such places as along the Yangtze River, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Hankou bought more than a thousand dan. The manufacturers on this street are also quite prosperous.</p>

<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Hollington K. Tong, a well-known figure in the American press, came to China to investigate the current situation in China and the state of the press. Leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and the Daily Newspaper Association have held public banquets to welcome him sincerely. A reporter recently heard from a friend who had spoken with Mr. Tong (hereinafter referred to as Tong) that Tong is the director of major American newspapers and the Associated Press. He is very familiar with the situation in China. Once, at a banquet, Tong had a candid conversation with a certain gentleman about the past and future situation in the three northeastern provinces. Tong raised a profound question that made us feel painful and resentful. That is: "...If Japan suddenly implements a truly friendly policy with China and completely returns the three northeastern provinces and Rehe to China, let us speculate, whom will China send to accept and manage these four provinces of land?" We should know that the background of Tong's question is that he knows what the three northeastern provinces were like under the rule of Zhang Xueliang and what Rehe was like under the rule of Tang Yulin. Some people may want to retort that if Tong really had such an intention, then given the current state of political disorder in all provinces of the country, wouldn't it be necessary to ask foreigners to govern them? But at the same time, we can also say that China's current political chaos is largely caused by the imperialism and capitalism of the great powers. In this semi-colonial situation, there have arisen the political fragmentation, economic bankruptcy of rural areas, and the immaturity of industrial production. Therefore, if we want to create a new life for the nation and build a new country with political order, we must first break this semi-colonial environment and eliminate all international forces that oppress China politically and economically.</p>
<p>If we criticize the above two different Chinese and foreign observations of the Chinese problem with a purely objective and unemotional attitude, we feel that each has its own merits. Because the latter's argument starts from the overall political and economic situation of China, and the lesson given to us by Mr. Hollington K. Tong's question is how determined the national government leaders have been to resist Japan since the September 18th Incident and the loss of Rehe this year, and where are the facts of improving internal affairs. We don't have to resent the mockery of foreigners. We should pay attention to the various opportunistic mentalities shown by the government and the people since the national crisis. In the past, when Tianjin and Beiping were in danger and the troops were approaching the city, the government showed various signs of being flustered and unprepared beforehand, and indecisive at the time. If the government and the people of today are determined to break the current semi-colonial status of the country and eliminate all international forces that oppress China politically and economically, then, let us ask, from what can we see the facts of the government's preparation for this? And from what can we see the spirit of the people's determination?</p>
<p>Without preparation, without determination, the future of the national crisis has no end!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Beset on All Sides by Life's Many Aspects <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Yiguang</p>
<p>(Seamen) Most Chinese seamen come from Shandong, Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Qiongya, Shantou, and other places. According to the work on ships, they can be divided into four types: stokers, sailors, stern, and mess hall. Because of language barriers, their regional concepts are very deep, which prevents them from forming close relationships with each other. At the same time, seamen who are sailors cannot be stokers, and those who are stokers cannot be stern or mess hall workers. The "She Ma Sha" (labor contractors) take advantage of this opportunity to divide and alienate the feelings of seamen from various places, so that the seamen cannot unite, and they have to submit obediently, allowing them to be exploited and oppressed.</p>
<p>The foremen on the ship are the figures who exploit the seamen together with the "She Ma Sha." Because every shipping company has a "She Ma Sha," the general bosses must use money to lobby the "She Ma Sha" in order to obtain the foreman's job. The "She Ma Sha" use various methods to make a group of foremen compete with each other. Whoever spends more tea money gets the job. The amount of money used is based on the size of the ship and the amount of profit. After the foreman gets a job on the ship, he goes to find a group of seamen to work. Everything is of course controlled by him, because they implement a contracting system. He finds seamen whose labor costs are low and calls them to work. For example, if the monthly salary for each person is 30 yuan, then the foreman will first say to them: "There is no salary for the first month, or only a few yuan are given. Are you willing to do it or not? And now there are so-and-so and others who are willing to work for three or two months without taking a salary!" Sometimes, when there is a business of smuggling goods, it is mostly handed over to the seamen to do, to take the fall. Once an arrest occurs, the responsibility of course falls on the seamen, and the seamen have to do this kind of knowingly illegal thing because they are forced by life.</p>
<p>These foremen, compradors, and senior staff often have opium lamps, fantan, pai gow, mahjong, poker, playing cards, etc. on the ship. On the one hand, they are of course set up for passengers, but on the other hand, they are to lure the seamen into the trap, so that they can extract a commission from them and enjoy the benefits. Opium lamps are their exclusive sales. They lure seamen to smoke in order to absorb their hard-earned money, so that their money is exhausted as soon as they get it and they are forced to borrow money from them. The interest rate on this loan is as high as one jiao to two jiao per yuan per month.</p>
<p>The working hours of seamen are at least 10 hours or more per day. Originally, for the hard work done by stokers and sailors, a maximum of five hours a day is enough. However, capitalists and compradors will not think about this. They just want to make money. Moreover, seamen are often scolded by the compradors, chief mate, second mate, chief engineer, second engineer, and foremen. No matter how they lose their temper, the seamen have to hold back their tears and force a smile!</p>
<p>As for the seamen's clothing, food, and housing on the ship, it is even more unspeakable. They live in houses that are only one zhang wide, with seven or eight or even more than ten people in each room, and they are in the hottest and most unclean places near the toilets and the stokehold. The clothing, shoes, and hats they wear should have been borne by the company, but because the foremen and "She Ma Sha" want to win the favor of the capitalists, they transfer all the seamen's clothing and soap to the seamen to take care of themselves. At the same time, the seamen's food is also contracted by the foremen. In name, the monthly food allowance is usually 10 to 12 yuan, but what they eat is the same as what dogs and pigs eat.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the health aspect on the ship. Originally, health should be emphasized on the ship, but all the doctors on the ship are hired entirely for the chief engineer, second engineer, chief mate, second mate, shipowner, and a few senior staff and senior passengers. If the seamen have a disease, they still have to work without rest. If they have a contagious disease that is dangerous, of course they cannot get up to work. Therefore, some conscientious foremen secretly take some medicine to help; if they tell the doctor, then this dog's life will be sent to the sea immediately. Because the doctors on the ship are most afraid of infectious diseases, if they know that a worker has an infectious disease, they will immediately use electricity or poison to kill him and throw him into the sea to avoid infecting the rest of the people on the ship. This is the sanitation on the ship!</p>
<p>An Interview with a Celebrity in the Business and Industrial World</p>
<h3 id="e240">An Interview with Mr. Zhu Zhiyao <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xingeng</p>
<p>(Comprador and Great Industrialist) Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, the grandnephew of the ninety-four-year-old Ma Xiangbo, once served as a ship comprador for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, manager of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and comprador for the Banque de l'Indochine. He founded the Qiuxin Factory, Lide Oil Factory, Tongchang Yarn Factory, Datong Renji and China United Navigation Companies, and is a great industrialist in Shanghai. Yesterday, I drove to visit him and was warmly welcomed. I am recording his conversation below:</p>
<p>(1) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: I was introduced by a relative to become a ship comprador for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. When the ship reached the middle of the ocean, the wind and waves were strong, and the ship was rocking violently. I vomited and was in great pain. At that time, I realized that the life on the ship was hard. I thought that I was a pampered child from a wealthy family, enjoying comfortable food and clothing. Wouldn't it be asking for trouble to come here? Then I suddenly realized that people should strive to survive in the world. With this self-encouragement, I became a comprador for eighteen years. (2) Banque de l'Indochine: When I was a comprador for the Banque de l'Indochine, my nephew Yunwang came to learn to be a comprador, but he was idle. So I said to him, "If you want what you want, you might as well climb a tree to catch a fish." He was scolded by me and never came again. Later, he also entered the customs service. He likes to study physics and chemistry and has many instruments. One day, he invited me and the customs officer to his house for lunch. During the meal, he experimented with yin and yang electricity and generated lightning. The customs officer saw it and was amazed. So he was promoted to chemical inspector and has been doing it until now. (3) Qiuxin Factory: More than 30 years ago, I traveled overseas with my uncle, Xiangbo. Seeing the development of industry in Europe and the United States, I decided to revitalize China's industry. So I opened the Qiuxin Factory. I was willing to make all the machines that foreign countries had. Like the sock knitting machine, which was imported from foreign countries and sold for more than 200 taels each, I sold my own made ones for only 25 yuan each, and I sold as many as two or three thousand!</p>
<p>(4) Jiangnan Shipyard: Later, I was invited by a friend to serve as the manager of the Jiangnan Shipyard. I received several thousand dollars in wages in the first month, which surprised me, but at the same time, it also emboldened me. So at that time, I expanded the Qiuxin Factory, and I also got a guarantee from President Yuan, with remarkable credit and booming business.</p>
<p>(5) Lide Oil Factory: Using soybeans to squeeze oil, the beans are covered with cake cloth, and the squeezed liquid is soybean oil. Speaking of cake cloth, the material is very strong. Imported from foreign countries, each sheet sells for four or five taels. I thought it was too expensive and wanted to make it myself, so I telegraphed abroad to buy a machine for making cake cloth. The reply said that the machine had to be sold for tens of thousands of taels. Because the price was too expensive, I replaced it with a carpet. But, alas, the oil had not yet been squeezed out, but the carpet was already broken. Later, I thought of a method, hired three workers, took hemp skin and composed hemp thread, asked them to weave hemp cloth like weaving horse belly bands, and used it as cake cloth, no different from foreign goods. Alas, I didn't expect that a machine worth tens of thousands of taels could actually be replaced by manual labor. Do you think it's strange or not! (6) Datong and China United Navigation Companies: Datong Renji Shipping Company has four ships, specializing in the Tongyang route. China United Navigation Company was founded only four or five years ago. Now it has three ships, specializing in the Haizhou route. When these two companies were first founded, each had only 200,000 yuan in funds. Due to the development of the business, they now each have several million yuan in capital.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Ten Million U.S. Dollars to Relieve the Wheat Famine <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Because China is experiencing a wheat famine, Song Ziwen recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation in the United States to borrow 50 million U.S. dollars (equivalent to more than 200 million Chinese currency). Four-fifths of this money is for buying cotton, and of course it is also because cotton is experiencing a famine. The rest is for buying wheat. It is said that this is beneficial to both parties; the surplus of the U.S. market can be sold, and Chinese people can be encouraged to use U.S. cotton and wheat. At the same time, the Chinese economy can also be reactivated, which is beneficial to the restoration of the world economy.</p>
<p>Let's just look at the benefits to both sides from the wheat aspect!</p>
<p>This transaction is of course very beneficial to U.S. imperialism, because it can dump its own country's overproduced wheat into China and also get a 5% interest rate!</p>
<p>What about semi-colonial China? Due to imperialist economic aggression, on the one hand, it accelerates the commercialization of agricultural production in China, so that the daily necessities needed in rural areas must rely more and more on markets full of imported goods. On the other hand, it destroys the family handicrafts in rural areas, separating it from agriculture and gradually becoming an independent production sector. The former increases the expenditures of farmers, while the latter reduces their income. Therefore, farmers are easily threatened by hunger. Exorbitant taxes, warlords, corrupt officials, and feudal landlords exploit the farmers, and the wars of Chinese warlords, with the conflicts between various imperialists as their background, are the inevitable result of conflicts with productive forces. Therefore, even though this year is a year of bumper harvests, the result is a bumper harvest turned into a disaster, and low grain prices hurt farmers. Because grain prices are low, even if farmers sell all the grain they harvest, the income is not enough to compensate for the debts, all the exorbitant taxes, and land rents. If American wheat is used for "relief," it will naturally cause the price of wheat produced in China to fall even further, and the result is that it will further accelerate the process of rural economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Secondly, this loan, as Mr. Geng, who is adding to the edition in this newspaper, said, "Debt is added to debt, and profit is generated from profit. The descendants and grandchildren who have not yet come out of their mother's womb will also have to accept in advance the fixed silver for working for others for free."</p>
<p>Also, this Sino-American loan has exposed the bloody conflicts of various imperialists in the struggle for markets. The London Times said in a report on the new Sino-American loan, "The result will increase the dissatisfaction of British creditors who hold Chinese debt." (See the 13th edition of this newspaper)</p>

<p>(Indentured Servitude Contract) Ms. XX arrived in Shanghai only to realize that working—especially in a cotton mill or silk factory—was far worse than the life of cattle and horses in the countryside. But in this day and age, being able to get a life like cattle and horses is already fortunate. Looking back at my brothers and sisters in my hometown, they can't even get a life like cattle and horses, how painful and unfortunate it must be!</p>
<p>In order to get this kind of work that is worse than that of cattle and horses, my father didn't know how many good words he said to Uncle XX, and he also sent two chickens before he agreed to introduce me here. On the day I was about to leave, Uncle XX lent my father thirty yuan, and asked him to write such a contract:</p>
<p>"I, XX, voluntarily state that due to family difficulties this year, my daughter XX is willingly handed over to the recruiter XXX to be brought to Shanghai Cotton Mill to work. It is clearly stated in the presence of a witness that thirty silver dollars are guaranteed, with a three-year term, and this amount will be paid at ten yuan each March of each year. After entering the factory, she will be subject to the recruiter's teachings and must not disobey. If she runs away or is abducted, or if an unexpected natural disaster occurs, the signatory will be responsible, and the recruiter will not be held liable. If she has a headache or a cold, the recruiter will be responsible. During the three-year term, the recruiter will be responsible for the girl's clothing. If there is a work stoppage, compensation will be paid in full. The term expires on the XXth day of the XXth month of the XXth year. After the term expires, one month's salary shall be given to the recruiter. To prevent future disputes, this is the proof."</p>

<p>— Zi Ju</p>
<p>The bullets of the "January 28th Incident" shattered my rice bowl invisibly. The chain of life was broken, and I drifted like a kite without a string, without any place to land.</p>
<p>I am a graduate of XX County Normal School. Driven by hunger and cold, I embarked on the road of life long ago. Although I have no special skills, continuous labor has been the only typical aspect of my past life. In the past five or six years, I have worked as a clerk, teacher, copyist, and in the military.</p>
<p>Now I have been thrown into the vast group of unemployed. Around me are the walls formed by class, but I am still struggling, trying to break through this encirclement.</p>
<p>I have no home, and my father passed away long ago. In a corner of the sky, under someone else's fence, lives my white-haired, desolate mother, living a lonely and difficult life. Today, I can only wander in Shanghai, taking refuge in Uncle X's home.</p>
<p>Counting on my fingers, I have been unemployed for more than a year! Now it is the season of moldy rain again. I sit all day in a pigeon-cage-like room, and a square, lead-gray sky weighs heavily on my head. My brain is swelling, and I cannot freely raise my head and take a breath. I never thought that I, a twenty-four-year-old man, would have nothing to do in this blind world!</p>
<p>My mother is calling me back, alas! She has forgotten that I am a homeless, wandering orphan. Where should I go?</p>
<p>Now, if there is any copying, clerical, or other work, whether in a company, bank, school, or individual, I am willing to do it. My desire is not high, I only ask to be able to maintain my personal life. If I am employed, I will be extremely grateful! Please forward replies through this publication. I am waiting with my eyes wide open!</p>

<h3 id="e245">Trendy Literati Are Not Yet Trendy Enough <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Let's leave the materialist sociologists aside for the moment. Even the trendy literati who know how to cater to the trends of the times are also changing their style, deliberately depicting the lives of the working masses and speaking out for their grievances; but aren't those who are languishing and groaning under capitalist society more than just this group of hard-working laborers?</p>
<p>The old-fashioned shop assistants have to get up at five or six in the morning to sweep the floor and take down the shop door panels. They have to attend to customers until there are no traces of people on the street and the landlady is sleeping soundly, then they can close the door and go to sleep. Sometimes they have to put down their bowls and chopsticks seven or eight times a day to attend to customers, but the price they get for a year is, at best, only a hundred gold. However, they can only blame it on fate. Who can notice that they are also living a life of slavery, no different from prisoners who have been sentenced to life imprisonment?</p>
<p>In addition, there are the small clerks and shop assistants in factories and department stores. On the surface, they have long gowns, shoes, and socks, everything is complete; their operations are nothing more than writing, bookkeeping, calculating with an abacus, and issuing invoices. Compared with manual laborers, it seems to be more convenient and leisurely. But they have to wear shoes, socks, and long gowns, especially they can't wear them poorly, otherwise people will say that they are detrimental to the employer's appearance. They also need to live in houses, and they also have old mothers, wives, and children to support; but how much compensation do they get for doing monotonous work for entrepreneurs all day long? In Shanghai, the average clerk or shop assistant earns a monthly salary of no more than thirty yuan at most, and as little as seven or eight yuan. With the cost of living in Shanghai being higher than everywhere else, how can they maintain their family's life? The positions they hold can be filled by managers and factory directors, and there are countless talents who are envious of them and waiting for vacancies. After all, they are not technicians, nothing special. If they make a mistake, the factory or store can immediately tell them to pack up and go home to drink the northwest wind. They have not organized any groups, and they do not receive any assistance. Their jobs are not guaranteed at all. In short, the pain they endure is like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, and has any trendy literati written an article to speak out for them?</p>

<p>This publication will soon launch the "Anle Life Shanghai Special Issue." We hope that writers from all walks of life will enthusiastically contribute articles. Articles that describe a life that is completely opposite to that of the poor, such as洋房, cars, big hotels,大酒, big theaters, high-class human flesh markets, the homes of rural despots, and other decadent and extravagant lives, and that can also grasp the times and have a sense of progress from time to time, are all welcome! Compensation will be generous.</p>
<h3 id="e247">A Sociological Examination of "Getting a Free Ride" in Heart Disease Sanatoriums <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>"Getting a free ride" has become a general phenomenon in Shanghai. The facts of "getting a free ride" can be seen everywhere. Especially on streetcars, "getting a free ride" by ticket collectors seems to be their regular job. Everyone who rides a streetcar has seen them "getting a free ride" with their own eyes. And the so-called ticket collectors also think that their wages are too low and not enough to live on, and that they cannot maintain themselves without "getting a free ride." In other words, in their view, "getting a free ride" has become the only way to improve their lives. This fact is said to be immoral by people who stand on the side of the capitalists' interests, and should be strictly prohibited. Other people who sympathize with the ticket collectors say that this is legitimate and should be done, especially since they are "getting a free ride" from foreigners or capitalists. We often hear this kind of argument. But according to sociological examination, these people only see the surface of the matter, and have not deeply investigated its essence. That is to say, they do not know whether "getting a free ride" is beneficial or harmful to the entire working class.</p>
<p>In the current society, there is no doubt that the workers are in a position of being oppressed and exploited. They sell their labor power all day long, but they cannot even get enough to eat. On the other hand, there are capitalists who do not work but reap the benefits, sitting back and extracting the surplus value of the workers all day long, living a luxurious and extravagant life. Therefore, the inequality of mankind and the phenomenon of the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer are rooted in this, becoming the source of all evils! But history tells us that following the deepening of this phenomenon, the awakening of the workers has been awakened. They realize that whether for their own survival or for the interests of the entire working class, there is a need for struggle, and only struggle is their way out. So the struggle is constantly active between them. However, the struggle is usually from within individual industrial sectors or special occupational organizations. For example, the past water and electricity strikes, postal strikes, and cotton mill strikes were all initiated from within a single organization. At the same time, they are still based on individual or special interests. Therefore, when they struggle, the scope is often narrow and not broad. That is because they only know that the interests of workers in the same occupation are common, and that they should unite to fight for these common interests. But the fact is before us, this kind of struggle rarely has a chance of victory, and is often taught a lesson of failure. To put it another way, the interests that are won are also very important to intensify this struggle, and to further win the final victory. However, this kind of struggle does not only focus on the interests of workers in a particular occupation, but must take into account the interests of the entire working class. It must be known that the interests of the entire working class are the real interests of each individual, and that the entire working class must be united to confront the capitalists whose interests are contrary, in order to maintain the interests that have been obtained or to fight for new interests. As for all other opportunistic methods, the workers should not adopt them.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the advantages and disadvantages of "getting a free ride" for the workers is not difficult to understand. Strictly speaking, "getting a free ride" has no meaning in improving life, it is just an opportunistic way to escape reality, enough to reduce the mood of struggle, blur the consciousness of struggle, shift the goal of struggle, and make them give up the task of fighting for the interests of the entire working class, and only take care of the current acquisition of such illegitimate interests. Moreover, "getting a free ride" itself is risky. Once discovered by the ticket inspector, there is a risk of being fined or fired. Even if he is lucky enough to get through it peacefully, he will only get a little "extra money". Is it worth it to devote all his energy to pay attention to it, and even recognize it as the only way to improve his life? Without taking into account the interests of the entire working class, even individual struggles cannot obtain the interests of the monarch. Then, this kind of opportunistic behavior to escape reality will certainly not be beneficial to the entire working class, but is completely harmful.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Lime Kiln, Where Corpses Are Everywhere <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhong</p>
<p>(Shacks) Lime kilns used to be places where lime was manufactured, but now they are another manifestation of urban contradictions. It is located in the middle of towering factories on all sides. Stepping out of the walls of Robinson Road, the boundary of England and China, is the boundary of the lime kiln. There are no tiled houses here, only thatched sheds. The first impression I got when I walked into the lime kiln was a grocery store. The most goods in this store are incense candles and paper horses for superstitious purposes. From this we can know the depth of superstition in the poor team, but that is also what their lives make them. They often encounter unemployment and illness, no one comes to rescue them, and they themselves have no way to find a way out for themselves. Then naturally they have to turn to the "gods" in the dark for help.</p>
<p>Looking from the north of this store, I can see a large wasteland. On this wasteland are scattered new coffins and packages, many of which are wrapped in rice straw, and many of which are wrapped in broken cotton quilts or burlap bags for wrapping sugar. What they are wrapped in are all dead children. They are unfortunate to be born as children of poor families. Their parents struggle for life all day long, but they still cannot get enough to eat. Of course, these many children will not have enough to eat or wear. In times of hunger and cold, they are often locked in thatched huts exposed to wind and rain. No matter how much you cry, their parents are selling their labor far, far away for a living. Although their love for their children is no less than that of the rich, they can only sigh and express their inner pain, except for thinking about it from time to time. These many children are sick! Not only is there no money to hire a doctor to take medicine, but there is also no good care for them. Their parents can only shed some sad tears for their children, but they can only watch their beloved children get cold! Stiff! Die! There is no money to buy a coffin, so they have to wrap it in rice straw and throw it on the wasteland. In such a slum, needless to say, the child mortality rate is particularly high. Every few days, the Pushan Villa comes to the wasteland to clean up once, and each time they can receive many!</p>
<p>Looking west from this store again, there is a big road! A dirt road, lined with many thatched houses on both sides, the eaves of which are level with my shoulders, because this dirt road is two or three feet higher than the ground on both sides. I walked to a door and saw an old man sitting there, so I walked down the road to greet him and asked the following questions:</p>
<p>Question: Grandpa, how many years have you lived here?</p>
<p>Answer: Five or six years.</p>
<p>Question: Do you have to pay rent?</p>
<p>Answer: The rent is not paid, because we built the thatched house ourselves, but the land rent is fifteen yuan a year, and there are also thatched house donations and the rules of the big township, which also cost more than twenty yuan a year.</p>
<p>Question: This road is higher than the ground in the house, will water flow in when it rains?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, so we build our thresholds very high. Small rains don't matter, but when it rains heavily, not only does the water flow in from the front, but it also flows down from the roof. So when it rains heavily, we can't even cook, only the sounds of crying and wailing. Also, the pigs that are raised run around outside when it's sunny, and when it rains, they burrow into the house and lie under the bed where people sleep, then it smells so bad!</p>
<p>Question: How many meals do you eat a day?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no fixed number. Sometimes we eat three meals, sometimes two meals, one meal, or everyone eats one meal of porridge a day. We just need not to starve to death.</p>

<p>— Ms. Rong</p>
<p>(One-story houses) Near the section of Gaojia Lane in Ximen, there are several 18th-century impoverished buildings—one-story houses—standing among the tall buildings, making them even more short and humble.</p>
<p>The eaves are as tall as a person, and the scattered tiles are as sparse as an old man's teeth; a few wooden boards support the front door, the stone steps are sunken, and the floor is yellow mud; the inside of the house is dark, making it difficult to see the furnishings, only the smell of pickled vegetables drills straight into the noses of passers-by.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the husband carries two buckets of pickled vegetables to the vegetable market; the son plays games on the street, such as carrying marbles and rolling copper coins; the wife takes advantage of the morning's quietness and moves a stool and frame to the street to embroider gold thread flowers—worn by characters in Peking Opera, completely made of gold and silver thread wound into figures, flowers and plants, the roughest of embroideries.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when the sun is imposing, the street is as hot and scalding as a steamer. They have no choice but to hide in the stuffy, small, and dark one-story houses.</p>
<p>Dusk, especially early summer dusk, is their active period. The faded table, stools of different shapes, round, square, high, low, long and short, are moved to the center of the street. The mismatched bowls and chopsticks are filled with yellow rice and vegetables without oil. They stuff their mouths with large and small bites at the table and in their hands.</p>
<p>The men, with one foot cocked on the stool, eat and speak, waving their hands and shaking their heads, so busy that they have no free time.</p>
<p>The women, fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans, gossip about the east and west families, giggling and talking loudly. The children, holding rice bowls with a small amount of vegetables on top, sit on the stone steps, exchanging "You give me a slice of vegetable," "I'll give you a radish," and eating with relish.</p>
<p>What a romantic and innocent street banquet! Do the gentlemen's gatherings and the refined people's picnics have such freedom and ease?</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, the street lights came on, the street banquet was over, and the conversation began!</p>
<p>The street is quiet, the street lights are yellow, and the people are gone. Only those low one-story houses, bathed in the yellow street lights, still stand peacefully and leisurely among the tall buildings.</p>
