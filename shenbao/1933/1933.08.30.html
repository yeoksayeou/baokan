<h3>法總揆視察邊境要塞</h3>
<p>宣稱法國需要自由與和平</p>
<p>如有故意犯境必堅决抵抗</p>
<p>梅茲國務總理兼陸軍部長達拉第、近在法國東部視察邊防工程、本日在此間接見新聞記者發表談話、略云、「法國對任何人固不挑釁、但如有侵犯法國者、無論如何必堅决抵抗之、現在國防鞏固、不患外侮、參加此項工程之人、於國有功、予以國家名義、向其申謝、」明日總理將往斯脫拉斯堡防禦地帶內視察國防工程（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法總揆達拉第自宣佈法國决議担保奧國之獨立後、即出發沿德國邊境視察砲台、此事已引起法國政界之深切注意、當彼出發視察前、曾發表一文、據稱、「法國需要和平、吾人之責任、在鞏固吾人之自由、但欲確保此項自由、必須先使人知吾等有保持自由之能力、同時吾人更須隨時察視、務期國聯及海牙法庭所成立之决議案及條例、均能遵守不渝」云云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）聞日昨十餘萬德人在萊因河畔之尼特華爾特山國家紀念碑前有示威之舉、適値法國總理達拉第亦於是時巡視亞爾薩斯勞蘭之砲壘、因此法國報紙均認達拉第氏此舉、實有與德國示威相對抗之意義、蓋萊因流域之薩爾區域、德國有重獲返國之希望、而予法國以極大之威脅也、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<h3>奧國改革軍制維也納</h3>
<p>政府宣佈、擬獲有聖日耳曼條約（即對奧和約）簽字各國同意、行將創辦民團、奧國各報對於此舉、均表示满意、謂聖日耳曼條約、准許奧國有陸軍三萬人、但奧國現有陸軍不過二萬人、此後奧國採用民團制、實即傾向强迫兵役之初步、此種强迫兵役、預定維持常備軍二萬人、每隔六個月再徵募八千至一萬人、其所受軍事訓練、僅以六個月爲限、惟特種軍隊之軍役、可繼續至一年、抑此種制度尙有一優點、即可藉此以减少失業人數、此節亦殊可寳貴、蓋現有多數無業之靑年、從此可編入行伍故也云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>比德邊界糾紛</h3>
<p>列日昨日比德交界處、又發生事變、晚間比國憲兵在莫賴斯勒地方、遇一乘馬著制服之希特勒黨黨員、經憲兵詢問、自稱迷途、遂將其帶回邊界處釋放之、同日在落郎地方、有希特勒黨五人、四人着制服、一着便服、在該處遊行、辱駡地方居民、憲兵聞訊、馳往察看、希黨見憲兵至、逃回德國境、迨憲兵旣去、其人又至原處、從新漫駡、憲兵第二次赶至時、希黨又欲逃避而着便服者以酒瓶向一憲兵擲去、傷其頭部、擲瓶者當即被捕、在生事之處、拾得希黨黨員所帶之盔一具、魏爾維耶檢察官對於此事、將從事調查、此外有一比國商人頃由德國歸來、曾在該國杜塞爾道夫地方被拘留兩日、其原因係因比人携有二百馬克强之欵項、而又在該處作一交易、二者均屬違反禁令云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德警越境捕人</h3>
<p>瑞士政府提出抗議</p>
<p>（巴黎）瑞士人民因德員屢次闖擾邊界、憤怒已臻沸點、瑞士政府巳向柏林提出抗議、最近一案、關係以私運食糖入德爲業之捷克人一名、其人爲自稱德警三名在距邊界三百碼處所拘、當扭毆之際、其人失血甚多、卒被拖入德境、瑞士稅關人員圖援助此不幸之捷克人、但力不足與三德人敵、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統接見英美金融領袖</h3>
<p>白宮聲稱會晤純屬酬酢性質</p>
<p>法國注視英美貨幣政策進展</p>
<p>海德公園據白宮秘書聲明今日美總統與英倫銀行總裁諾曼會晤時、所談不過天氣海行及艇游等寒暄語、並消磨一部份光陰於參觀消夏白宮（即總統私邸）未嘗提及安定貨幣問題、蓋諾曼之晉謁總統、純屬酬酢性質、至諾曼在返英前是否將再謁美總統、及是否將與紐約聯邦儲備銀行總裁哈禮遜·財政次長阿哲森等作長談、白宮秘書均未表示、且對於新聞記者所詢者、拒絶作詳細答復、僅一再聲稱、此次進謁純粹酬酢而已、按紐約銀行家曾謂美總統與諾曼之會晤、將討論安定貨幣問題、故外間對此極爲注意、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>佛郎地位危殆</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法金融當局現以銳利目光、注視英美通幣之進展、英鎊美元價皆下趨、其及於佛郎之危險、隨時可發生即金融當局亦承認此最後危機爲不遠也、英國爲營業起見、隨美元而抑低鎊價之政策、已爲人所深悉但安格魯撒克兩大國幣價之低落、法國對外貿易能與之對抗至何時乎、此爲問題、比利時國家銀行總裁今日在常年大會所發用金國能維持金本位一語、稍可使人寛慰、巴黎證劵交易所未有特殊投機之活動、但較諸去年亦不相上下也、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>各方揣測紛紜</h3>
<p>（紐約）英倫銀行總裁諾曼遊美之目的、繼續引起各方面之猜測、銀行方面斷定諾曼來遊、决非純粹社交、因知諾曼確信英鎊美元價格之穏定、爲世界復興之要素也、官塲方面雖稱諾曼興哈理遜及其他要人之茶會談話、並不預示美國金融政策之立即變更、然衆料英倫銀行總裁之來遊、或可左右羅斯福總統之將來政策、大約羅總統在其復興運動未有結果以前、不致遽採行任何新的貨幣政策、惟諾曼定將力陳其主張、以爲一種暫時穏定匯率之計畫、不獨不妨害、且亦助成美國復興運動、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎「經濟財政通信社」發表紐約消息、對於羅斯福總統與英格蘭銀行總裁諾曼雙方談話、加以分析、據云、官方雖宣稱羅斯福諾曼與紐約聯邦準備銀行總裁哈里遜之會見、純屬交際性質、但未可置信、因諾曼欲使美政府穏定美元則已失敗、當星期一日會見時、局勢並未有何項正式發展、羅斯福頗爲機巧、竟將會晤之事、變爲夏令之郊外叙餐云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美恢復金本位制</h3>
<p>尙未至適當時機</p>
<p>海德公園一般人相信羅斯福總統雖準備發表關於穏定貨幣之宣言、但在目前尙以爲時機未至、羅斯福之意、欲使美元離開金本位自由漲落、以達到與他國貨幣比價穏定之點、此外並欲明瞭現在信守金本位而預算虧耗之國家、是否能維持金本位到底、因此羅斯福擬俟上項問題獲得順利之答案時、始乃考慮恢復國際金本位、但决不提前加以考慮云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國復興程序</h3>
<p>善後社成立放欵機關</p>
<p>接濟遵守業規各商行</p>
<p>路透社二十八日海德公園電羅斯福總統與內務部長伊克斯、今日討論促進復興程序之計畫、伊氏於談話後吿人、渠主張對於未在限定時期內開始復興辦法者、不予以接濟金之分配云、羅總統今日諭令金融善後社成立一機關、對於隸屬國家復興案執行處之商行、迅速予以暫時之放欵接濟、俾商行得以渡過開支驟增、而收入一時不能到手之時期、</p>
<h3>美政府宣布减少麥產</h3>
<p>路透二十八日華盛頓電農長華萊士今日正式公布减少美國種小麥之畝數百分之十五、按此舉乃於兩日前决定者、農長華萊士估計麥田將减九百六十萬英畝、麥產將减一萬二千四百萬布施爾、農長又稱、美國所提出倫敦恊定之補充辦法、八月二十九日可望簽定云、但農長未曾宣佈此補充辦法之內容、復興案執行員約翰遜將軍今日聲稱、煤礦勞資雙方對於煤礦業規、巳成立恊定基礎云、</p>
<p>玻巴軍隊鏖戰聲中</p>
<h3>和平運動復起</h3>
<p>南美四中立國擬定解决方式</p>
<p>秘魯願與哥倫比亞息爭言和</p>
<p>國民二十八日倍諾斯艾理電此間接訊、巴拉圭與玻璃維亞軍隊繼續在大厦谷鏖戰、星期日一役、雙方死亡不下四百人、中立委員會雖懇勸停戰、兩政府俱無願開談判之象、</p>
<p>國民二十八日巴西京城電拉丁美洲外交家刻正迅速促成和平機械、希望十二月間泛美大會在蒙的維第烏開會時、南美各國咸能和諧工作、阿根廷·巴西·智利·秘魯·四國所組和解委員會、今日已將所提解决大厦谷爭執之方式、提出當事國間、而秘魯爲避去捨己芸人之誚、今日亦聲稱、秘魯與哥侖比亞代表不日將在此間開會、討論萊特西亞問題、聞泛美聯盟職員正加壓力於巴玻秘哥四國、迫其釋爭言和、從事經濟問題之整理云、</p>
<h3>摩萊辭職宣言</h3>
<p>聲明與赫爾絶無芥蒂</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十八日紐約電副國務卿摩萊辭職業經照准、摩氏頃宣言、渠雖於九月初實行解職、然在九月中旬以前、仍當繼續進行關於犯罪問題之調查、又謂渠久已與財政家阿斯多氏商談發行一種新雜誌、至渠之辭職、並非因倫敦經濟會議與國務院意見不合云、</p>
<p>國民二十八日華盛頓電摩萊博士巳向公衆聲明、渠與國務卿赫爾絶無誤會與芥蒂、而赫爾對於摩萊之辭國務副卿亦表示驚異、現此間政界對於此事、巳不復再提、今日亦罕有再談及摩萊者、若在數日前、則摩萊之名固常不去耳者也、但今則一般居官位者對於摩萊之辭職、亦罕有當衆表示惋惜之意者、</p>
<h3>南洋華僑反對郵資增加</h3>
<p>（南京）行政院據新加坡華僑各會館及旅港潮州八邑商會電請收回南洋郵資加價成命、已飭由交部、轉令滬郵政總局、妥爲勸導解釋、（二十九日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之外交方針。</h3>
<p>日本外交當局近一方面密切注視宋部長回國後中國政府之行動。一方面又注視歐美各國今後對付中國之態度。其目的在使分散我國與國聯之合作而實行中日直接交涉之主張以便達彼壟斷中國權利之目的此固無</p>
<p>論何人皆能知之者也然而日本人欲逹此主張。須先自問對華直接交涉之議倡之已久何以我國人至今無絲毫表示贊同之意。其對歐美屢用其欺騙恐嚇之手段以離間我與歐美之好感何以各國至今非特無一信任日本。而且皆表示反對致日本陷於如此之孤立狀態日本人如能深思其故。幡然覺悟則今日决不致再用其從前一意侵略之政策。而必於根本上改變其外交方針此又爲顯然可見者但觀其最近表示。殊未見其有改變之誠意前傳日本外交政策將變更者今又謂日本對華外交方針並無變更。前傳對歐美外交取各個聯絡者今又謂須取周密之注意而不必過事周章表面上觀之。第覺其模稜不定而實則其政策始終一貫未嘗稍有所改變也。當內田上台之初曾宣言即「全國化爲焦土亦必保持滿洲」云云。此種傳誦一時之焦土外交雖內受國內民衆之冷笑外受國際與論之譏評然其當局。確實具此决心今日表面上雖不顯然續倡焦土外交之高調而其實彼所謂大陸政策。固未嘗稍有所改變也。</p>
<p>吾人細審日本當前情勢默察世界現局可知日本對華外交。并未變更其歷來傳統之思想與方法換言之即仍繼續其侵略政策。今日復宣言不變更對華外交方針者不外兩種意議。一則對日本國民申述其外交依然遵循舊路以維繫人心一則對世界各國申明日本對華立場以示無悔禍之心。如此則中日關係果尙有好轉之望耶東亞和平尙有樹立之可能耶。我國人民自東北四省淪亡三千萬人受日軍鐵蹄蹂躪輾轉呼號無可吿訴。長城以內之領土日軍亦借口所謂滿洲傀儡國之安全縱兵深入其於北寗路沿綫。則以辛丑條約爲口實旣縱兵爲害復造匪殃民其於鐵路以外區域。如興隆則蠻横强佔如密雲則硬不撤兵由榆關以至秦皇島完全在日軍之手。近日軍復又唆使僞國李守信部復擾多倫準此現象日本豈但不顧國際信義。蹂躪我國主權即墨蹟未乾之塘沽恊定亦一併否認之。則其所謂不變更對華政策者即不變更其侵略故技耳。</p>
<p>故自前年九一八以來。我國絶未有一人肯承認日本之割裂我領土爲合理更未有一人贊同日本親善之論則所謂直接交涉將從何說起。况乎日本陸軍一九三四年度預算其新要求竟有二億一千萬日金。海軍新要求數達四億三千萬日金合計基本預算陸軍計入滿洲事件費。總計須五億七千五百萬日金海軍須六億八千萬日金支出如許巨額軍費而言和平豈非夢囈。由此以觀日本對華仍繼續其傳統的侵略政策對英以至其他國家。僅以和平作面具其所謂不變更外交政策者又即不變更其實行備戰而已。鳴呼日本之外交政策如此我國所以應付之方針將何如哉。</p>
<h3>焦土外交趨於恊調內田受軍財閥夾攻</h3>
<p>軍閥擬擁松岡上台</p>
<p>內田曾一度萌退志</p>
<p>（東京）據東報所傳消息、內田外長在葉山曾向齋藤首相提出辭呈、並表示不出席今日之內閣會議、經齋藤首相慰留內田萌退志之原因、蓋爲受軍財兩閥之夾攻、軍閥迫內田外長實行强硬外交、此無異於歐美向日開戰、內田亦認爲此種政策非忠於國家之外交政策、一面又爲財閥之經濟第一主義所動、由焦土外交漸趨於九一八前之恊調外交、軍閥以爲此種政策、十分不利於軍部之好戰政策、暗中排斥內田外長、又使其派下之法西斯團體、運動軍部造成之外交英雄松岡洋右出任外長、但松岡洋右之態度甚消極、聞松岡自從歐美返國後、深感以空洞之愛國情感辦外交、將來必貽禍於國家、返國深隠於山間、不願表示意見、欲使國民漸趨冷靜、然後方能爲國家定百年之大計、松岡洋右在文藝春秋九月期、亦有表明其心情、故軍部之此種運動、從內外情勢估最起來、在目前仍缺少實現之可能、（二十九日華聯電）</p>
<h3>駐外使節將大更動</h3>
<p>（東京）據日政界消息、在九月中日外務省之駐外大公使、將有一番之大調動、駐法大使巳請假返國、駐英大使松平恒雄亦將退隠、出淵駐美大使因受軍部之排斥不久亦要吿退、聞宮內大官林式部長官已表明辭意、繼任者擬荐松平駐英大使、松平大使爲皇弟秩父宮之岳父、又爲貴族之後裔、日皇將授男爵與松平恒雄、使松平重列貴族云、（二十九日華聯電）</p>
<h3>松岡使美徵求同意</h3>
<p>（東京）前在日內瓦爲世界的活躍之松岡洋右、巳於二十五日上京、目下勾留日光、重光外務次官曾派特使赴松岡邸、請其就駐美大使、內田外相以松岡洋右將於月末歸京、屆時再正式交涉、松岡是否承諾、不得而知、惟外務省則極力勸駕、</p>
<h3>波蘭公使內定伊藤</h3>
<p>（東京）外務省以前駐波蘭公使河合博之逝世、巳內定昇任帝國國聯事務次長伊藤述之繼之、另以駐比大使館參事官橫山正幸繼伊藤、（二十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>日政友總裁鈴木答訪齋藤</h3>
<p>提示所謂具體國策</p>
<p>精神上已獲得諒解</p>
<p>（東京）鈴木政友總裁今晨訪齋藤首相於其四谷仲町之私邸、爲第二次會見、精神恊定已於第一次會見成立、關於國策之大綱、大體意見亦已一致、本日關於個個政策、將虚心坦懷、交換意見、齋藤首相固須考慮閣內及民政黨之意向、不能即時表示贊否之意見、然對政友之恊定案、務必作成妥恊的、認爲不能實行者則削除之、以目下非常時無論何人認爲必要之政策爲原則、故國策恊定可望圓滿進行、又電、今晨鈴木總裁訪問齋藤首相時、因第一次會見未談及具體的政策、此次則提示政友會所草成之恊定案、並說明政友會之意向、首相亦說明與若槻民政安達　同兩總裁之會見顚末、會談約卅分、鈴木總裁於上午九時廿分辭去、（二十九日電通社電）</p>
<h3>五大政綱</h3>
<p>（東京）今晨訪問齋藤首相之鈴木政友會總裁、提出包含五大政綱之政友會政策、其綱要如下、</p>
<p>今退出國聯·海軍條約之更改·世界產業線之重壓·國民經濟之不安·思想事件之頻發等、內外情形迫切之非常時局、正有入第二期之慨、此際吾黨依旣定之指導方針、提倡左列諸項、㈠外交方針之確立、及國防整備之充實、對國聯·對中·俄·英·美等確立外交方針、并實行外交機關之刷新、於國防則確立以滿洲及委任統治地爲第一線之根本方針、與產業之發達、同期其萬無遺漏、㈠日「滿」問題、爲調整日「滿」經濟聯合之結成、根據有無互通之方針、圖調達資金·棉花·羊毛·燃料等之自給、對國礎舉强固之實、㈠經濟及產業問題、防遏輸入、增進輸出、努力實現增加國民所得爲目的之吾黨立案產業計畫、實行改善金融制度、以圖維持發展中產階級、注全力於實施防止失業之根本方策、㈠改革行政、實行根本改良諸般之制度、圖改善敎育制度、以求敎育之改善、國民思想之涵養策、㈠財政問題、實行極力排除無濟、同時講求因官業根本的改善等之增加歲入之方法、以確立財政之基礎、（二十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>安定人心</h3>
<p>除上述之五大政綱外、所謂超越問題、爲善導國民思想案、蓋人心之安定、爲國家統治之根本條件、若蔑視之、無以行眞之政治、吾黨前途之主張、在國民多數要望之打開時局、故確信此爲最有效之對策也、（二十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>閣議承認</h3>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相於今日之定例閣議、報吿訪問鈴木若槻安達三總裁之情形、及與鈴木政友總裁第二次會見之內容、後謂、政友會提出國策恊定之覺書、欲依此方針實行政策、若由政府製案、希望採入其覺書之主旨、而考慮製成具體案云、且傳余對該案之主旨、因與政府之意見大體一致、故擬咨政府各機關後實行之、并求各閣員加以諒解云云、經請求各閣員承認後、各閣員亦無異議、當即承認、（二十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>貴院態度</h3>
<p>（東京）齋藤首本關於政策恊定問題、巳與三黨總裁會見、傳近有與貴族院方面會見之希望、據貴院有力者之觀察、貴院各派與政黨不同、無主義政策、雖被請恊力、恐無人肯負責任、首相雖要求會見貴院方面、亦不過報吿恊定問題之經過、求其諒解而已、集各會派之交涉委員、會見固可、恐將待近衛議長歸京與正副議長會見、亦未可知、總之不過儀禮的而巳、政治的恐無重要意義、（二十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>各方批評</h3>
<p>（東京）政友會之國策、未得各方面之好評、即民政黨謂政策內容、過於抽象的、本黨並無表示贊否意見之必要、政友代表將來訪問、僅止於聽其說明、不與之交換重大意見、國民同盟曰、政友會之政策、本黨絶難接收、旣成政黨應速解消、貴族院方面亦謂其無價値、民政國同兩黨必不囫圇呑棗、據陸軍方面意見、鈴木總裁至今日提出抽象的意見、毫無批評之價値、鈴木應早知國民對於政黨之批評如何、彼如認識此非常時局、則不必重提抽象的意見、當即單身跳入閣內、使內閣斷行各種國策、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日海軍當局說明造艦目的</h3>

<h3>魯省黃河水勢</h3>
<p>中下游可望落水</p>
<p>濟南通信、黃河中游及下游水勢、依然未减、幸上游漸見落水、水源不旺、中下游當不能再漲、或暫保現狀、亦未可知、據河務局近得上游電報、李升屯昨晚落八公分、今早又落九公分、共一分寸七、形勢暫穏、</p>
<p>中游方面、形勢依然危急可慮洛口附近因係石壩、比較堅固、且韓主席派有軍隊恊助搶護、暫時平穏、蓋家溝迤東之紀莊、埽壩業巳漫水、附近有王爾莊、巳首蒙水害、北岸齊河迤西之索莊、今日背河曾出有漏洞、河水汨汨漏出、幸發現尙早、立即堵塞、又北岸齊河迤東之五莊、壩頭塌陷、刻亦正在搶護中、河務局長張連甲、因河水連日猛漲不已、中游民埝極爲可慮、今日特往洛口察看、並巡視洛口附近埽壩、指揮兵夫搶護、期保無虞、</p>
<p>下游方面、北岸惠民境之李家、形勢吃緊、惠民縣長五鴻績、分段長李福昌等、連電吿急、略稱、「今早李家第十三壩前頭、爲溜淘冲、陸蟄入水七尺、查該壩頂衝大溜、設有疎虞、有關以下各壩安危、正在搶護間、其第十第十六兩壩、下角復蟄、當即添民夫四百名、並亟搶護、希保無虞、惟所存蔴袋、恐不敷用、懇請局長速發蔴袋五千條、派員運工、以濟要需」、河局當覆一電、略謂已派稽查李宗堯押送蔴袋五千條運工備用、務切實壓護、以免疏失、如需稭料、亦准分上民料若干、以濟工用、王鴻績等旋續來電報吿、以本日督飭民夫搶護李家第十六壩用柳樓護、裝蔴袋六百條、現已出水、及新十三護沿上首坍處趕抛石料、以禦塌堤、其十三·十四·十五·等壩、因溜勢過猛、先後吊蟄入水、查該壩極關重要、恐有顧此失彼之虞、不敢稍涉鬆手、迅即督率兵夫星夜用柳樓廂抛壓蔴袋一千條、無如大溜淘刷、仍屬蟄動甚烈、遂打椿拴繩、以保安全、至丑刻均搶廂出水、河局當即覆電、令切實嚴防、又南岸齊東境禹王口第二壩、今又吊蟄七八丈、正用蔴袋搶護云云、</p>
<p>總計黃河此次自十九日起漲水、連漲七天、至二十六日始見平水、水勢之大、爲從來所未有、今日中游洛口落水三分、水位三十一公尺二寸二、下游大馬家平水、水位十五公尺五寸三、據河工人談、再有三日、即可落水、今年搶險、共用蔴袋十餘萬條、只此一項、即需四五萬元云云、（二十七日）</p>

<h3>招待記者詳述感想</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時、宋氏在祁齊寓邸、招待各報社記者、到三十餘人、茶點後、在園中環坐、宋氏首向各記者寒暄、並表示感謝、旋即自由問答、茲綜合宋氏談話要點如次、㈠歐美各國遭受經濟困艱之恐慌、俱各想種種方法、變換各種手段、撇開以前關於經濟學之原則理想、唯求解决目前困難、余抵美國後、覺察美國之經濟困難已有轉機、以前胡</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>佛任總統、墨守成法、處處保持穏健、對於關稅幣　捐稅等制度、不顧加以改革、且總統之權力、亦不若現任羅斯福總統之偉大、然自羅繼任以後拼命開　出路、認爲經濟恐慌之困難不能解决、整個　家社會之前途非常危險、故羅氏就任時、有多數銀行倒閉者、政府以金錢救濟之、幣制方面則毅然放棄金本位、雖然、按美國狀况、無放棄金本位之必要、蓋其貨物仍爲出口多而進口少、且爲世界之債主、擁有世界金融十之六七、然其用意、乃在提高物價、果然今日之美國、其棉麥及股票等價格、巳高漲許多、因此羅斯福總統就任以來、獲得多數人民之信仰、除美國外、余歷經英法意德各國、觀察各國所採方法雖各有不同、然求解决目前之經濟困難之目的則一、至此次英倫舉行之世界經濟會議、除銀恊定而外、其餘如幣制關稅未有具體結果、成效不見偉大、嗣後或將再繼續召開、惟瞻望前途、困難尙多焉、</p>
<h3>棉麥借欵支配用途</h3>
<p>㈡在美成立之棉麥借欵、確係以統稅爲担保、現棉花部份、已開始運華、嗣後將源源而來、麥子部份、則因價格尙未商妥、故尙未開始購運、惟棉麥用途之原則、爲求建設起見而舉借、當然供給華商廠家、未聞有轉售外國廠商之事、該項棉麥之用途支配問題、完全由我國自主、絶未與美國當局談及、關於棉之支配、將與政府當局從長研究、然後决定、至於美棉麥運華、於我農産影響之過慮、則可以歷年海關進口入超之情形對照、且該項棉麥亦屬陸續而來、不致有若何影響、關於棉麥借欵之支配、迄今尙未議及、亦將與政府諸公商議後决定、至於因棉麥借欵而生枝節謠傳、謂向英借欵購軍火等詞、完全不確、</p>
<h3>法西斯蒂團結一致</h3>
<p>至歐洲各國政治上之觀察、意德均爲法西斯蒂制、然方法雖不同、精神則舉國團結一致、一切不由個人支配、而由國家支配、工人不罷工、資本家亦不减工資、以社會國家之利益爲利益、共謀國本之安定、如美國最近實行之復興計劃、其目的實亦歧途同歸也、最後、宋氏答記者問、關于西南以反對中央之口實、發電致各國當局、宋氏謂此舉于我國體誠有若干影響、然我人亦應盡力解釋、消除各方誤會、蓋我國在此嚴重時期、唯一出路、唯賴團結、且所謂團結、應不尙空談、每人　俱能切實抱犧牲精神、方可達到眞正團結一致之希望云、</p>

<h3>資方聲言僱用新工英美工潮惡化</h3>
<p>倘資方無滿意表示準備罷工</p>
<p>海員等工會紛紛致慰問聲援</p>
<p>學校糾紛昨日調解毫無結果</p>
<p>英美烟廠勞資爭議、久懸不决、以致新老兩廠怠工一案、工會昨招待新聞界、報吿經過、學校事件、社會局昨日調處、仍無結果、工會以廠方代表不負責任呈請黨政機關請求更調、并定下星期四開第三次代表大會、决聯合總罷工對付、海員等工會誓爲後盾、各部工作依然停頓、形勢日趨嚴重、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>力爲後盾</h3>
<p>中華海員工會籌備委員會、昨函五區捲烟會云、逕啟者、　　案准貴會函開、略謂廠方擅訂廠規、剝奪工人利益、修改勞資條件、不服調解非法記過、開除工友、違抗政府命令、拒絶工友復工、離間團結、種種壓迫等由准此、查該廠此種舉動、荒謬絶倫、實令人髮指、除派幹事冷仁義、詣前慰問外、并願率領八十萬海員、力爲後盾、用此布達卽希查照爲荷常務委員楊虎張創白·林蔭生·</p>
<h3>各界慰問</h3>
<p>英美烟廠工會、因廠方一再破壞勞資條件、裁减工友、違背政令、拒絶工人復工、改於本月二十五日聯合新老兩廠工人八千餘人怠工、以促廠方最後之覺悟、不意廠方置若罔聞、以致怠工五日、意見未臻接近各部工人因未有結果、仍怠工抗爭、五區黨部與工人等嚴守秩序、特於昨日派代表沈丰梅、中華海員工會派冷仁淸、五區棉織工會派葛雲亭等前往慰問、又浦東各工會自二十七日發表聲援宣言後、現各工會已定期下月初、在浦東水木業工會開會討論、屆時聯名通電聲援、</p>
<h3>呈請備案</h3>
<p>五區捲烟工會、於前晚召開代表會、决議組織罷工委員會後、於昨日呈請市黨部社會局備案、原呈云、爲呈請備案事、竊職會於本月二十八日召開緊急代表會議、業蒙鈞會局派員陸蔭初同志、蒞塲指導、在塲當經决議怠工、日久廠方仍不覺悟、决組織罷工委員會、於必要時、行使職權、當塲推定委員十九人、職會全體理監事二十人、爲當然委員、所有會議情形、理合呈報鈞會局鑒核備案謹呈</p>
<h3>調解失效</h3>
<p>關於英美廠方奪取勞工敎育權案、社會局昨再召集雙方調解、出席市黨部陸蔭初、敎育局唐敬修、資方李德克·陳滄再、勞方陳培德·劉德華、列席者　景觀·張子平、由社會局土剛主席、市政府并規定解决辦法、校董制度改爲五五五制、由工會廠方敎育局各派五人充任、六項辦法、工會當表示對於改組校董會原則接受、惟資方校董須有股東資格、經費由工會領取、校董亦須由工會聘請、并聲明學校業已開課、而資方未許將操場門開放、應請制止、對於市府規定辦法、須寛限部討、主席當詢資方意見、决改期再行調處、</p>
<h3>招待報界</h3>
<p>同時該工會、因恐各界不明眞相、特於昨日下午三時三十分、在八仙　靑年會招待報界、到中外各報社記者五十餘人、席間由主席陳培德報吿經過、繼復請予以文字之援助、聞該工會復擬宴請各界、作同樣之乞助、</p>
<h3>請撤代表</h3>
<p>該工會以資方每次出席調解代表人事股主任西人李德克對於黨政機關之調解、諸多非難、有時竟聲明不能負責、致勞資積案纍纍、無法解决、昨特呈請市黨部社會局請求撤換、該代表另令資方推定全權負責代表、免致遷延時日、致重糾紛、（原呈甚長從略）</p>
<h3>準備罷工</h3>
<p>五區捲烟業工會·自葉子部怠工後、於本月十八日開第一次緊急代表大會討論應付辦法、决新老兩廠工人聯合怠工、以促廠方之覺悟、因資方不理、故於二十五日實行怠工、因廠方仍不理、故於前日開第二次代表會、决組罷工委員會業巳呈請黨政備案矣、現工會再寛待一週、如廠方仍然不理已定九月四日下午五時三十分、在浦東會所開第三次代表會、屆時將實行罷工、以期得有最後之解决、</p>
<h3>雙方堅持</h3>
<p>據英美資方傳出消息、謂爲如各工人今日仍不復工、則將雇用新工人、並用大批警探保護工作、態度甚爲堅决、或有實施可能、而據工會常務陳培德語新聲社記者稱、工人對於此事、態度甚爲堅决、有不得結果、誓不甘休之勢、工會一方惟期當局設法弭補之、免達最後不幸之罷工目的、同時决依據工人意志、進行代表會决議之步驟、積極辦理、聞市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、現正以私人資格、從中斡旋、恐難收效、</p>
<h3>非戰大會在滬開會日本反對甚力</h3>
<p>兩租界當局因此</p>
<p>或亦將拒絶開會</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日下午世界非戰同盟遠東大會主席英國代表馬萊爵士、往訪駐滬英國代理總領事台維森、知日本現反對非戰大會在滬開會甚力、故公共租界與法租界當道、或將因此拒絶該會在界內舉行會議、據台維森聲稱、日本曾表示願兩租界當道勿准非戰大會在界內開會、租界當道前於淞滬戰爭之際、時與日本發生爭執、故殊不欲復因非戰大會事而引起齟齬云、聞馬萊爵士不日擬入京拜訪政府諸要人、探詢彼等之意旨、</p>
<h3>李神甫發明測定地心吸力新擺</h3>
<p>大陸報云、徐家屬天文台主任李神甫兩年前曾在巴黎發明一新擺、能在頃刻之間測定地心吸力、比諸用舊法而歷時大半日所能測得者、更爲準確、若利用此器、乘飛機測繪全中國詳細地圖、則前此歷時百年而不易吿成者、不難於數年之內全部　事、日前李神甫曾赴牯嶺晋謁軍事委員會主席蔣介石、詳陳利用此器、從事天空測繪地圖之便利、甫於上星期杪回滬、蓋李神甫今夏爲試演新擺之實際價値計、曾偕北平研究院代表羅瑞玉（譯音）在湖北陜西兩省利用此擺、由天空測繪地圖五十萬方公里、約占中國全面積二十分之一、僅兩月而畢、若照舊法計算、地心吸力、則至少須歷五年之久、當時每隔一百公里測量地心吸力一次、故兩測量地點吸力之中數、與全區域之吸力相差極微、此次測量兩省結果、每向西方山地前進則吸力漸减、在與海岸綫成南北向並行綫之地帶內、地心吸力常相等云、</p>
<h3>林康侯昨晚返滬</h3>
<p>林康侯君前赴南洋一帶游歷考察、業巳事畢、搭由昌興公司坎拿大皇后號、於昨日下午六時半返滬、當由浦東其昌碼頭、換乘小輪、於七時五十分、至新關碼頭登陸返寓、</p>
<h3>電信機械製造廠停辦經過</h3>
<p>本埠浦東交通部電信機械製造廠、自奉部令停辦後、交部卽派專員二人來滬接收、現在該廠正趕辦結束事宜、預備月底點交、但工人方面、仍希望復工、並請求俞廠長暫緩移交、據聞、此廠停辦問題、醖釀已久、部方自去　迄今、曾屢派專員到廠視察、並令該廠力加整頓、但視察結果、均謂該廠內容、殊欠完善、故部方最後决定、令該廠暫時停辦、以資整頓、並擬將來擴充、俾出品增加、以備需用、至　　廠技工、前已明令給資遣散、但仍擬從優待遇、以示體恤云、</p>
<h3>國聯專家讚揚海關行政完善</h3>
<p>記者昨晤及海關最高級職員某君、談及近日江海關聽差舞弊之事、某君頗爲表示痛恨、惟謂此係一部份茶役之所爲、與海關職員無關、外間不察、以訛傳訛、致有疑及海關辦理之不善者、實則海關自開辦以來、迄今八十餘載、制度成績、雖不能即謂盡善盡美、實亦已斐然可觀、至於作弊方法、層出不窮、而以海關制度之嚴整、當能隨時發覺、此尙堪自吿無愧於國家社會者、再則自中國與國際聯盟積極合作以來、中國政府所聘請之理財專家沈慕偉·及馬騰·二人、亦已來華、從事於調查籌劃、今已數月於茲、彼等對於中國之海關除向總務司署詳詢一切外、並巳自行向全國各埠海關調查實况、彼等二、人、對於海關之行政制度等等、均一致稱許、而馬氏除讚揚海關行政之外、並謂建議此種制度之完整、應加以保存、而其他政府財政機關、亦應一律仿效施行云、查沈慕偉爲英國前任勞工内閣之勞工次相、而馬騰則爲國聯方面之理財專家、該二人之言論、當非謂言、</p>

<p>又一兇殘之箱屍案</p>
<h3>屍身支解爲八段</h3>
<p>木箱内藏頭顱與身體</p>
<p>包裹中係兩手與兩足</p>
<p>粤民醫院中病者目擊經過</p>
<p>昨晨四時許、虹口狄思威路保安路口、發覺一暗殺案、被害者係一男子、於事後被兇手分屍、裝入木箱及布包内、僱車抛棄該處、茲將調查所得、分述於下、</p>
<h3>查崗見木箱與布包</h3>
<p>狄思威路第一千一百十四弄、前達狄思威路、後通長春路、該處乃係越界築路、因此五區一分所崗警、僅在長春路口、平日狄思威路捕房、亦派捕不時在該處巡邏、該弄左近、有一粤民醫院、患病住院者甚多、當昨晨三時左右、五區一切所查勤巡長李雪山、照例出外查差、由第一崗而至十八號崗、並穿越第一千一百十四弄、繞道狄思威路、而擬赴邢家宅路、查察第二十號崗、當李步出該弄、行近粤民醫院旁時、見該處適在修築馬路、行人道上堆有土堆兩處、李乃擬繞道而過、並用手電筒探照、詎突見兩土堆中間、放有紅漆木箱一只、及白底藍花布包一個、李當時甚爲奇訝、候片刻、未見動靜、乃仍前往各崗查差、於六時返所、將上情報吿梁所長、前往查勘、</p>
<h3>屍體寸斷腥血慘然</h3>
<p>待李警長經過後、狄思威路捕房第三三二零號夜差便衣巡捕、亦於四時許巡經該處、並亦繼續發覺上述木箱布包、當時該捕疑爲竊賊遺贓、諒其定來拾取、故亦在粤民醫院門旁隠伏片刻、但亦不見動靜、該捕乃上前察看、則見木箱一隻、上漆劣質紅漆、並用繩縛、作十字形、布包一個、係白底藍花布包、外裹已壞之草蓆一條、該捕於是大疑、正擬打開探視時、適有一人力車夫、經過其處、該捕即呼之來助、先去布包外草蓆、繼解布包、諦視之、則赫然已被鋸斷之兩腿兩足兩手、血漬殷然、腥臭撲鼻、該捕一見、毛骨悚然、乃亟奔至捕房報吿、立由華探長尙武、探目徐芝卿、探員陳大寳等馳往查勘、並將木箱繼續打開、則見内部胥用油紙襯底、上面放一破靑布白領夾襖、下面係帆布一方、再揭視之、則男子頭顱一枚、及屍體中部一段、滿箱血漬殷殷、於是得悉定係暗殺無疑、乃亟將木箱布包帶入捕房、待五區一所前往查勘時、則巳經捕房先帶去矣、</p>
<h3>支解八段無損骨骼</h3>
<p>及將各物帶入捕房、經再度檢查後、竟發覺死者共被分屍八段、最奇者厥爲屍體被分處、胥在骨骼接處、雖筋被割斷、而骨無損、似深解人體結搆者所爲、死者頭部傷有五處、計後腦左頰頭頂後頸前額、以後腦一刀爲最深、屍身中段、計左乳一刀、前心一刀、血尙汨汨外流、而捕房方面爲便利偵查計、乃即於當時、將屍體平舖地上、按部位排列、則赫然一整個之男性屍體、年約三十左右、頭髪作圓頂、生前體格甚强、並察得頸項被割處係用小刀所爲、隨又攝影多幀存案、並分送五區一所等、請予恊助、一面即會同五區一分所梁所長、重往出事地點附近察勘、於是遠近喧傳、爭往觀看者數百人、粤民醫院内病人、亦多憑窗以視、未幾竟傳遍該院全院、同時捕房及警所方面、亦進院問訊、希冀刺探綫索、</p>
<h3>黎儉三述目睹情形</h3>
<p>詎斯時該院二樓某號病房内病者黎儉三、忽自稱目睹該案移屍始末、並稱渠之病房、適臨第一千一百十四弄口、當昨晨二時許、黎以天氣酷𤍠不克安睡、乃起床�</p>
<p>推窗、臨街納凉、並游目四矚、呼吸新鮮空氣時、突見一人力車、由南北來、車上坐一身穿黑長衫男子、前面放一木箱及布包、車後隨一徒步身穿藍布短衫褲男子、緩緩而進、驟視之、意爲車中人抱病、由其護送來院醫治者、車至該院門首左近時、即停下、由穿藍布衫褲者、帮助黑衣男子、將木箱布包搬下、並由黑衣男子付給車夫車力二角、及車夫去遠、該兩人始終未進醫院、但見其將木箱布包、重行搬放在兩土堆間後、始四向窺探、倉惶而去、初不知有如斯慘案也、</p>
<h3>警捕觀察悉力調查</h3>
<p>捕房及警所旣悉上情後、即出院各向主管長官報吿、並研究案情、至昨晚十二時、記者重往各方探訊時、據稱尙無線索、惟根據黎君報吿、及屍體踞解方面着想、佐以木箱布包形狀而觀察、則可分三點、㈠察死者之形容四肢等、斷非上等人物、㈡兇手定深明人體結構、或竟以屠宰爲業者、㈢木箱布包等類似貧民用品、佐以黎君所述當時目擊情形而觀、則更足證明死者確被殺於中下等人之手、故刻下全市各警所及英法兩租界方面各捕房、現正向各人力車行、調查當時被僱車夫下落、追查木箱等裝車地點、一面尙在向其他行業中、愼密偵查、想不難水落石出也、屍體已由捕房車送斐倫路騐屍所、報請法院、於今晨檢騐、</p>

<h3>前蘇俄協助會職員發表商業機關政治陰謀</h3>
<p>俄貨在華傾銷華貨輸俄减少</p>
<p>表面英國公司從事特務工作</p>
<p>謀剌汪精衛輸送傳單與宣言</p>
<p>瑪理生負責致各報函</p>
<p>新聲社云、本市北京路二號蘇俄恊助會、係蘇聯在華貿易之總機關、一月餘以前、該會曾發生職員之離奇失踪案、當時各報均曾盛載其事、迄後失踪之職員瑪理生、又自行來滬投案、經第一特區地方法院之審訊、始悉所謂離奇之失踪案、完全爲該會内部含有政治性質之糾紛事件、并曾間接表明蘇俄恊助會之存在、不僅係一單純的商業機關而巳、日前本埠某西報紙記者、曾爲該會主任馬可夫談話、發表最近中俄貿易情况之記事、瑪理生閱讀後、以當事人之資格表示該記事之不眞實、乃即負責起草、「致上海各報館書」辨正馬可夫談話之虚僞、同時揭發蘇俄恊助會在華從事秘密政治活動之内幕、甚至有計劃行剌行政院長汪精衛氏詭謀、該函係八月十九日寫成、當時瑪理生因事亟於他去、乃將原函托本埠友人代發、茲新聲社記者、在某關係方面覓得該函之華文稿、照錄如下、</p>
<h3>隠懣之事知之頗詳</h3>
<p>編輯先生大鑒、本埠某報社發表該社記者與馬可夫之談話、該談話内容、爲關於大拍賣組織、穏當且順利交換中俄商品之俄國恊助會、馬可夫卽該會上海分會會長、馬氏於談話中、作以下表示、「俄國恊助會、卽俄國消費合作社中央聯合會、該會之工作、有益於大不列巓及中國、」果君等能將報端搜集之充分事實、供給鄙人、則吾頗感激、因可一方面校正馬呆夫談話之許多缺點、另方面闡揚馬可夫隠懣該機關在華及他處秘密活動、我本居當事人地位、尤其我居於該公司業務進行等問題之呈報地位、因我不久前、乃該公司職員、及出口部主任、對馬氏隠懣之事、知之頗詳、</p>
<h3>近十年來有利中國</h3>
<p>據馬可夫云、「俄國恊助會創始之最初目的、爲發展貿易、該公司純粹爲蘇聯托拉斯之拍賣機關、」可知該公司純粹爲拍賣機關、蘇聯托拉斯運貨於後、彼卽將貨物拍賣、得取手續費、此卽俄國恊助會之全部目的、如僅借馬可夫之論調、則俄國恊助會對蘇聯之政策及行動、無任何關係、馬可夫繼稱、「俄國恊助會上海分會之主要目的、爲發展貿易、及鞏固中俄兩國之商業關係、」據馬可夫意見、經彼努力之結果、於此方獲得勝利、亦係事實、馬會長所觀察之勝利、卽近十年來世界上中俄兩大國間貿易、頗有利於中國之事情、</p>
<h3>俄貨傾銷華貨少出</h3>
<p>當然、馬氏（以下馬氏字樣均指馬可夫言）有權觀察俄國得利之處、卽他人眼光中、俄國虧本之處、果馬氏根據事實立論、我亦不欲反駁、不過對馬氏甚抱歉、我須與彼爭論、對於有利中國貿易額之程度、稍加幾許解釋馬氏引證數字表、證明一九二八年至一九二十三兩年、中國出口超過俄國入口、此數字表頗滑稽、乃蘇聯官僚、大勢嘲笑讀者之心理作用、據馬氏云「彼所引證之事實、乃根據中國經濟雜誌之紀載、」但我亦無此項消息、該雜誌係何時出版、有否此項數字表、馬氏由何處得來此表、我以爲實質并非如是、馬氏爲何於中國雜誌上、尋求自已機關内滿藏之數字表、馬氏何不採取便當方法、容易手續、公布自己之商業報吿、及會計師製成之確實賬目、我答復此問題、或因該公司爲英國機關、而俄國恊助會之業務報吿史、卽完全與馬氏所講不同、我以俄國恊助會前任主任資格、有權證明中俄貿易、對中貿易額不僅無利、益且相反、蘇聯目下入華之傾銷商品、數倍超過華貨入俄者、</p>
<h3>華茶不振水泥衰落</h3>
<p>本年蘇俄、對華貿易計劃、吾知之頗詳、蘇聯政府令俄國恊助會、運華商品、有下述各種、一千一百萬（均以墨西哥洋計算）元木材、四百萬元棉織品、五百五十萬化學品建築材料、及西門土三百萬元、魚類二百萬元、皮毛藥品酒及水菓、共計二千二百五十萬元、此爲俄貨入華者、而華貨入俄者、唯一商品爲茶葉、據馬氏稱、「去年華茶入俄者、减至三百十八萬七千九百四十元、按本年計劃、華茶入俄者、則應减至百分之三十三、因俄國將購買爪哇及其他國之茶葉同時俄國將於本國發展種茶事業、」果如是、則對華貿易之利僧何在、蘇聯在華傾銷政策、實行之程度、可就中國西門土業聯合會致莫斯科中華大使轉蘇聯政府提出之抗議、反對蘇聯傾銷政策、危及中國西門土業生產、及工廠停業可能之事實、卽可推測、</p>
<h3>英國公司倫敦註册</h3>
<p>俄國恊助會爲英國公司慨因此而馬氏亟力破壞英商布陸湼爾及門德之營業、因該二英商、不斷運華炭酸曹達炭化納等化學業品、并减低價格、俄國恊助會、曾企圖與該二英商恊議、一致消滅天津之中國曹達工業然後再消滅英國之同盟者、（指該二英商）此計劃爲馬氏與巴比基所作、我當參加實現此計劃之工作、然而馬氏談話之主要意義、不僅包含該公司商業化活動之問題、馬氏堅持兩種意見、㈠俄國恊助會爲英商、㈡粹純商業組織、不作任何政治活動、俄國恊助會、按英國商法、於倫敦註册、因此該公司得英國法律保護、對此點必須明瞭、該公司享受英國行政機關之保護、英國行政機關、於相當範圍内、亦得負責該公司之行動、至於註册後、我卽嚴重否認、該公司爲純粹商業機關、因事實已證明相反、我舉幾種事實於馬氏、此種事實、彼均詳知、並不少知於我、</p>
<h3>特務專家協會人員</h3>

<h3>死的定義</h3>
<p>— 顧錫章</p>
<p>生離死别是人生最大的痛苦，最大的憾事，可是誰能逃避這痛苦的難關？誰能免除這憾事的發生？</p>
<p>但，一個人有了生，繼有死，有了聚，　有離，所謂天下没有不散的筵席，就是不能背違這自然的定律。</p>
<p>然而在這個矛盾的畸形的現社會下，儘有許多祈求長生不老的有福人，也有許多惟恐不死而自速其死的可憐蟲。</p>
<p>我們試把報紙上的社會新聞欄翻閱一下，觸目的標題無非是「某靑年謀生無着，窮途末路而投浦！」「某某因失業而不能維持生計而自殺！」「某某因經濟壓迫而服毒自戕！」他們没有法子把可憐的靈魂苟延殘喘下去，他們不能把可憐的軀殼維持到自然崩潰的最後一天，不得不抛棄了一切寄生着他的人們丨丨父，母，妻，女，違背了自然的定律去找覓死亡的途徑，死是痛苦的，但他們以爲這死的痛苦，可以解决他生活着的更大的痛苦。</p>
<p>達官顯紳是有優越的地位，赫赫的權威，巨大的財產，嬌美的妻妾，一生惟恐享受不盡，想祈求不老長生，希冀死神永遠不要降臨，可是死神是無情的，它對於每一個人們，都是如此。</p>
<p>於是我們從死字的取捨來觀察，就可獲得社會上兩個對峙的陣線。</p>
<h3>乞丐劉</h3>
<p>— 春華</p>
<p>看到上海隨處都有乞丐的蹤跡，於是我不揣謭陋的對乞丐下一番膚淺的研究。</p>
<p>美國學者格林Ｇ·Ｌ·Ｇｉｌｌｉｎ在美國社會學雜誌上說：「在古時候，社會上没有乞丐的，只是一種從某一個族羣裹的人出外去旅行，流落在異鄕，後來得到了慈善家的救濟，這就是乞丐的濫觴。」</p>
<p>不過，現在事實吿訴我們，中國乞丐的躑躅在街頭，散布在巷尾，是商業經濟的紊亂，機器昌明，手工業失敗所造成的結果。所以也好說：「社會上發現乞丐，是表示一種社會和經濟無組織的現象。」當然一個人不能拿心和力去換取麺包和食物。只能出賣人格去行乞，這是最羞恥的事。但，不行乞，不做工，和没有工作做是不能生命的。不行乞又怎樣？所以乞丐也就充斥於社會。</p>
<p>歐洲各國，對於取締乞丐是很嚴厲的，一槪實行强迫做工丨荷蘭爲乞丐安置了三個做工的地方，葡萄牙也設立了很多的工廠給乞丐做工，比利時也有有規模的乞丐收容所的設立。德國在戰後設立收容乞丐的塲所有三十幾處之多。而中國獨付缺如。寗勿引爲遺憾？</p>
<p>因此我就有一點感想，就是歐洲各國的立國，是民衆的生活爲前提，民衆的苦樂爲對象。而中國却是離開了民衆橫斡，私鬥强爭，形成了民不聊生的内亂不算，在天災之後而苛捐雜稅還是頻頻如諸民衆的仔肩，硬使得抬不起頭來。要不然，人非草木，誰不喜歡在家過些安穏的日子，却願意在外斡些流浪顚沛的乞丐生涯。乞丐是造成了，當局何不急切添設工廠，收容這些無家可歸，無飯可吃的乞丐，而政府的信望又何嘗不能藉此增重呢？</p>
<h3>時代姑娘</h3>
<p>— 虎頭</p>
<p>姑娘，姑娘，提起『姑娘』兩字，似乎有一種魔力，値得一般少男注意，而尤其那些毛頭姑娘，有勾魂攝魄的本領。本來少女的丰神，處處足以表示處女的自然美。無怪墮鞭公子，走馬王孫，終日昏懂懂做着追逐異性的迷夢！</p>
<p>這裏有三種時代姑娘，可以上，中，下，三字，來分析伊們的等級。</p>
<p>現在先說「下」字的一級：這些姑娘，以江北產居多。伊們的爸媽，大都揑着小鐵錘，專門替人家敲磚石排三和土的；或者背着破畚箕，向垃圾、堆中找尋些「拾着不歡喜，丢掉不肉麻」的東西。這些姑娘，自幼薫陶慣的，也從來不想將來如何過活，所以一睜開眼，便跟着做這些工作，一天到晚，身上没有乾凈的辰光，看去要比燒窑的夫役還骯髒！我何以位置之？所以放入「下」字一級。</p>
<p>其次要說「中」字級了；這些姑娘程度，資格，在在比較高尙些；或許也有識得幾個粗淺的字。大槪伊的爸，在工商界裏做事，月入不豐，所以不得不由伊媽領到紗廠或香烟廠裏做些工作貼補家用。這是很好的一夫一妻分工合作制的小家庭。姑娘們年紀漸漸大了，一個人留在家裏，諸多不放心，格外是充滿誘惑性的上海，於是不得已也帶入廠裏帮着做些工作。這些工廠，在市面好的當兒，每天出產一兩塊錢，也不是一件很爲難的事！丨伊們掙錢旣如此容易，所以時時想積些錢，做件新衣裳穿，小姊妹淘裏同出同入，多麽寫意！近目一二八戰後，華洋各工廠，關門的很多，於是這些靠此營生的小姊妹淘，整時發現恐慌！有些睚作聰明的姑娘，便羨慕着摩女舞女等生活的寫意，相率改業，於是墮落的也一天多似一天。</p>
<p>「上」字級的姑娘，要算最無憂慮，年紀小時，伸出手討零用銅鈿：等到入學年齡，便渾渾噩噩到學校裏去。名爲念書，實則學年結束，識不到幾個字。一年年讀上去，用費一年年添加，好在伊們父兄袋裏，麥克麥克滿不在乎。誰知道讀了好些年頭，科學文學，並没有進步：而能突飛猛晋的！只是寫「哥呀！愛呀！」？肉麻不過的情書，所以學校畢了業單等吉日良辰的光臨：若有要人來說親，便做姨太太也願意了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十四回　授室多艱徘徊憂後顧　邀朋小聚靦覥記前</p>
<p>可是他媳婦寫信來，孩子病了，首飾出當了，他還没有什麽回家念頭，一個人討厭家庭，何以就會到這種樣子？這樣看起來，家眷倒是不要的好嗎？慢着，等我去問一問殷得仁。他是一個要守獨身主義失，究竟是怎麽一回事，我得去問問看。他自己揣想了一陣，就跑到殷得仁連部裏來。他倒是很高興，兩手撑地，在屋子裏拿大鼎。趙自强道：喝！眞有勁，檢閱過了，你就是神仙了。殷得仁兩手連拍着灰笑道：不檢閱過去，我也是這樣子樂。我心裏，什麽時候，也是空空洞洞的，不愁着什麽，也不想着什麽，爲什麽不樂呢？趙自强正想引起他的話來呢，便笑道：誰又愁着什麽，誰又想着什麽？殷得仁笑道：這還用得着說什麽，你現在就整天的想媳婦。趙自强在身上掏出一盒烟捲來，取了一根，慢慢的抽着，便笑道：老殷，你爲什麽不要媳婦？殷得仁將他放在桌上的那盒烟捲，取了過來，將一根抿在嘴裏，然後在桌上找了一根火柴，抬起一隻脚來，將火柴在鞋底上擦着了，點着了烟，然後横躺在他的小床舖上，兩隻脚搭起一個高架子來搖幌着。趙自强笑道：和你說着話啦，你這是一套什麽做作？殷得仁只躺在床上嘖出烟來，並不說什麽。趙自强道：你這人怎麽了，我和你商量着事情，你倒和我要骨頭。殷得仁由床上跳了下來道：你有事情和我商量，怎麽不言語哩？趙自强笑道：其實我的來意你知道，故意裝傻罷了。殷得仁拍着他的肩膀，笑道：這件事，你别問我，你去問小田，他能給你一個答覆。你没聽見人說過嗎？寗可失業，不可失婚。（一七三）</p>
<h3>「照會」</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>有錢人，買了汽車，第一最要緊的事情，就是「打照會。」自然啦，備了汽車，少不了「照會。」没有「照會」，汽車等於擺樣兒，只好陳列在家内，不能開出去。否則，巡捕老爺見了你的汽車，没有「照會。」哼！「大亨」不相干，公事公辦，不捐「照會，」只有罰錢的辦法，没有别的話兒。不然，爲什麽？一天到晚，在馬路上風馳電掣的許多汽車，竟找不出一輛是没有「照會」呢？</p>
<p>本來「照會」這樣東西，爲用甚廣。豈但汽車需要「照會，」就是其它任何的車子，甚而至於做小買賣的攤販，都不可没有「照會。」</p>
<p>不過，汽車的「照會」，有點小講究。據區區所知道，就是「照會」上的號碼，要特别。能彀弄到一張聯號的「照會，」那便顯見你的闊。因爲這種「照會，」是要特别化錢設法弄來。因此弄得了這種「照會，」汽車在馬路上橫衝直撞，巡捕老爺看在「照會」上多少佔點兒便宜！</p>
<p>唉！「照會」好，佔便宜，豈僅汽車是這樣？講出來，如果你不信，請在電車或是公共汽車裏，便可瞧分明。那班自命爲懂得文明禮貌的仁兄，見了鷄皮鶴髪的老太婆，有似没有瞧見一樣，動也不動的坐着。可是見了摩登美貌的大姑娘，眞有勁，任是車子震動得站不住脚，没有辦法，只好拉住了藤圈圈，站了起來，恭請姑娘坐。這是女子的「照會」好，得男子的「抬舉。」至於男子的「照會」好，佔女子的便宜，並不是區區嚼舌頭，姨太太倒貼「小白臉」，常有所聞，嘸啥稀奇。總而言之「照會」好，佔便宜，信不信由你。</p>

<h3>金石家趙古軼事</h3>
<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>我邑（常熟）金石家趙古泥先生，名石字古泥，一字石農，工書，得翁松禪之神髓，能金石，運用錢筆，自然入妙，江南除吳昌碩外，古泥可以首屈一指矣。近以逝世聞，爰將其生平軼事，拉雜誌之，俾關心金石書畫者，得知其大槪焉。</p>
<p>古泥昔年爲藥肆夥，據聞該店係翁相國松禪家所設，日見松禪臨池之樂，取其殘箋碎片，作依樣葫蘆，久之漸肖，松禪亦樂而爲之師，遂盡力研求，日有門徑，當時松禪所書　聯等之圖章，亦古泥所鐫，松禪歸道山後，世欲得翁字者甚多，古泥效其體以應付，求者　滿意而去，後幾難辯是翁書是趙筆也，且其圖章，亦與松禪相同，雖識者不能辨，迄今北平天津等地之翁字，多趙之手筆。</p>
<p>古泥不以書名，而以金石名，海上書畫家，咸稱古泥能鐵筆，而不及其書者。曾從吳昌碩游，題其書齋，曰拜缶齋，缶老在時，亦以俊才相許，今則昌碩墓草靑靑，而古泥亦已長眠地下矣。</p>
<p>古泥嗜茗，常聞坐於常熟之逍遙遊，憑窗茗話，平日與文友吳　𤍠　，互相調詼爲樂。朋好少長　咸集，皆以石伯伯呼之，不知者，疑其姓石，而不姓趙也。居恒藹然含笑，無疾言厲色，兩頰美髯，長可數寸，頗似騷心于右任，而較騷心爲短，亦一奇相也。</p>
<p>昔孫傳芳長蘇時，某君請古泥鐫印二方，贈於孫，古泥索價百金，否則不刻，某君報以六十金，古泥撫髯笑曰：「孫傳芳之印，僅値六十金乎？」言畢大笑，後卒未得，某君亦不再求，古泥此舉，頗有蕭伯納之幽默風趣。</p>
<p>古泥無後，僅有掌珠一，名林，亦工書，善鐵筆，普通書件及圖章，咸由其女捉刀。人亦莫能辨其眞僞。古泥死後，其女林在常熟琴報，刊自訂潤例，以鐵筆易錢，藉奉其母，巳許字於我邑書家肅蛻庵之子，現以父喪尙未於歸，前任蘇州某法院書記，今則閉門讀禮，以金石爲緣焉。」</p>
<p>古泥生前是達者，死後事預爲之謀，入棺時，衣履咸爲普通所御者，棺價僅値四十金，且遺言不可焚紙錠，不可請道士和尙爲經懺，更不可發訃并喪，亦不許請風水者靈别言向，賣地於早成門外，地僅三弓，爲古泥之歸骨地，背山面湖，風景佳絶，名山深處，得葬名人，自是生色不少，且元畫家黃　痴，淸畫家翁松禪，同葬西同脚下。相比爲鄰。夜台定不寂寞矣。</p>
<p>古泥將死時，其族中從子自鄕間來，欲爲其後，古泥不可，以三百金分其從子二人，囑彼等好自爲之，勤於其事，人問其故，曰：「生子賢不肖，尙不能顧及其後，况從子乎？我已有女，能繼我後，何必有子哉？」其曠達處，非常人所能及。</p>
<p>古泥病時，日夜揮毫，以淸書債，書債旣淸，復終日執鐵筆，後病加劇，尙伏枕爲之，死後無積欠求者之字及圖章，一如先知其死者。待最後一章鐫成時，不禁長嘆曰：「未了事已了淸矣。」古泥死後，邑人歸炯　輩，徵求古泥遺墨，擬刊印專册，以誌永好，且徵求詩文誄詞，爲刊哀悼錄，以留紀念云。</p>

<p>自由談說同情  林徴音　　要博到人家的讚歎，並獲得彷佛自己是在不吝惜地施與而在實際上又什麽都不損失的快感的，最好的是用同情。因爲能同情人的人一定是胸懷寛大的人，這是已經一般地被云認了的事實。　　要是有一個人爲了一種主義被捕了，而且被捕了就有被失去他的生命的危險的話，你可對他說：『哦，你眞偉大，你能爲你的主義而不惜犧牲一切！我同情你。』　　要是你碰到一個在賤價地出賣他的體力，出賣他的智識，而還没有出賣他的靈魂的人，你就可說：『雖然用世俗的眼光看你是没有成功，可是你的超脫，你的不肯遷就，是無可誹議地値得欽佩的！我同情你。』　　要是他是一個雖然肯賤價地出賣他的體力，出賣他的智識，甚至出賣他的靈魂，還是無人顧問而在生與死之間轉輾着的人的話，你可毫不遲疑地說：『你是勇敢的；你那樣不顧一切地與惡劣的　境奮鬥，你總有找得你的新的生命的一天！我同情你。』　　你不必顧到對方，你可不問對方聽到了你的話會有怎樣的一種情緒。他受到了你的同情後，也許他會感激，也許他會氣憤，也許他會鄙視，出許他會感到受侮辱，可是那都没有關係，那是他的事。在你，你只是在寛大地同情着，要是他會起什麽不愉快的感覺的話，你可說那是他的曲解。　　同情人家在表出你的寛大的胸懷以外，還有一椿附帶的好處，就是因爲你在同情他，由此可證明你的識見比他的高，或者你的遭遇比他的好。狗才論  君　　「寗爲太平狗、莫作亂離人」。　　只要社會秩序稍發生擾亂，一般人是常常用這麽兩句話當作口頭禪的。認眞的說，他們的着眼點只在「太平」與「亂離」，而没有注意到「人」與「狗」。從實際考察起來，你如果還有人氣，即使天下太平，仍然少不了迫害；至於狗，却是左右逢源，無往不利的。　　淸朝入關了，正是需要狗的時候，狗的心理他們是知道的，用鞭箠或許要困獸猶鬭，妙而省事的策略，還是籠絡來得高明。於是乎前朝降臣，一仍明制，束髮，預進賢冠，長袖大服，和滿洲大臣分作兩班。高等狗與普通狗旣然主從分明，不獨深合普通狗的心理，而且管理上也便當。有一位山東進士孫之獬，却不揣冒昧地想摹仿高等狗！也便是主子式的服裝。他首先薙髪，服袍套，以爲這一來，主子一定另眼相看的。他上朝了，歸入滿班，高等狗不答應；再歸到漢班，普通狗也蔑視他：在無可奈何的時候，他上奏摺了：　　「陛下平定中國，萬事鼎新，而衣冠束髪之制，獨存漢舊，此乃陛下從中國，非中國從陛下也」。　　這自然是對的，於是薙髪令下了，孫之獬也一帆風順，做到禮部右侍郎。　　同時有一位原任知府的「聖裔」孔文謤，雖做了狗却還要擺「聖裔」的架子，想借他家「先聖」的招牌來抵攩一陣，他也上奏摺說：　　「禮之大者莫要於冠服，先聖之章甫逢掖，子孫世世守之。是以自漢曁明，制度雖有損益，獨臣家服製三千年未之或改。……應否蓄髪以復先世衣冠，統惟聖裁」！　　狗居然自有主張，主子擺到甚麽地方去呢？「聖裁」的結果是這樣的：　　「薙髪嚴旨，違者無赦，孔文謤奏求蓄髪，已犯不赦之條：姑念聖裔，免死。况孔子聖之時，似此違制，有玷伊祖時中之道，着革職永不叙用」。　　這眞是話該！　　狗，一曰漢奸，換言之，也就是不背「伊祖時中之道」的所謂識時務的俊傑。凡稽古右文之君，没有不培植狗才，來替自己做事的。但有時也上當，把狗才的職能看錯了，往往將意良法美久著成效的方略，輕易變更。淸康煕二年八月，就有這樣的上諭：　　「八股文章實於政事無涉，自今以後，將浮飾八股文章永遠停止，惟於爲國爲民之策諭表判中出題考試。欽此」，　　用策諭表判來選拔狗才，自然是安全的，但若與八股文相較，便差得多多。萬一遇着老實人，眞要「爲國爲民」一下，胡思亂想，想出一些道理來，不是欠妥之至麽。於是，康煕八年禮部便題請仍用八股取士，「聖祖仁皇帝」也猛大省悟　　過來，一法通，萬法通，除恢復八股以外，崇祀孔子，親往釋奠，並飭國子監講求性理之學，風示漢民：開博學鴻詞科，網羅雋義：開館編會典，字典，明史，佩文韻府等書，以爲士則；巡游江南，召試名士，以察人心：開千歲宴，不論滿漢官民，凡年過六十五者，皆得與宴賦詩，以示滿漢一體；……在「乖乖嚨地咚」一通之後，還有有受抬舉的，又繼之以刀。於是而稽古右文之盛業成，於是而培植狗才之偉烈遂，於是而八方頌德，天下太平！　　中國的歷史雖然悠久，敎育的目的似乎是一貫的，取士的方法至唐以後，更没有多大變更。許多人希望產生天才，許多人希望產生人才，其實都是多餘的希望：社會是需要狗才的，造成一個狗才之後，還怕運蹇時乖，没有出路，那裏談得到什麽天才人才呢！鐵籠裏的獅子  依雲　　因慕獅子的威名，我到大世界去看過獅子。但當我走到鐵籠前，却大大的失望了！那獅子實在太不成獅子樣子：毛是脫落得像一條癩皮狗，埀着尾巴，懶懶地一步一步的踱着，連正眼也不敢看籠外的人一眼。籠外的孩子們，一邊牽着大人的衣角，一邊大聲地向着籠裏吆喝；但無論他們吆喝得怎樣厲害，却始終不能惹起籠内的獅子的怒來。那獅子反而踱進裏階，躺下去了。散披在頭上的毛髪，正像一個没有梳妝的女人，更顯得憔悴與衰頽。這獅子是使我失望的。想不到一匹稱王稱霸，長嘯一聲足以振動山嶽，足以使百獸驚惶的東西，竟是這麽的一副可憐樣子。　　最近也因爲慕獅子的威名，到市動物園裏看獅子去來。那兒的獅子到也還有幾分獅子樣，毛是還没有脫落。我看見牠時，牠正踞在假山石上，向人虎虎的注視着，但没有作聲。籠子是比大世界的考究多了，粗鐵枝外面再是細鐵枝，就差着獅子的脚上没有套上鐐銬。我是因爲慕獅子的名而來的，所以在獅子的籠外站了好一會。然而在那默默的雄踞着的獅子身上，我除發現牠好像一匹大貓之外，却總描摹不起我理想中的獅子來，那機巧靈敏，豪厲峭拔的獅的靈魂已經找不到了，雖然這獅子尙不至如大世界的獅子似的頽唐萎靡。但這動物園是才開幕的，那獅子被囚的時間大槪還不十分長遠，所以還能向人虎虎注視，没有到埀着尾巴向裏階躺下的程度。　　日前聽見說動物園裏的一匹黑熊，在被飼食時把那個飼食者抱住了，就此那人幾乎送了命。但我想這黑熊大槪也是被囚不久，所以還帶有幾分蠻性吧？至於兆豐公園裏的那就决不會如此，看牠們不是很巧妙的向人要着花生吃麽？　　於此，我感到幽囚的力量的偉大了。那些　扈不羈的大人物，常是被人長期幽禁着，而且幽禁些時之後，便會「轉變」起來，大槪也就是這緣故了。六月天  朱迅沅　　這是一個六月的淸晨。　　天空綴着疎落的晨星，一鈎殘月還滯留在西方。田野間撒着層紗樣的薄霧，一切景物都顯得迷離模糊。在這迷離模糊的曉色中，却有許多戴着凉帽的頭顱，在靑靑的　　中，起伏　動。　　每個頭顱的下面都是一個腌讚的身體；這身體差不多完全没在腐臭黏汚的泥水裏。每隻滿塗汚泥的手在稻根的四周抓，抓去侵蝕稻的野草。臂上堅實的肌肉在汚泥内隠約地伸縮着，這是一股氣，一分力。　　膝頭跪在濘滑的泥裡，好像陷入了無底的深淵；慢慢地慢慢地陷下去，一直陷到跨下。過了一會，膝頭就向前移動，陷入另一個深淵。泥水濺起來，濺到每個人的眉間唇邊。　　有時，幾個膝頭獨在尖銳的稻根上，紅的血和黑的泥水立刻混流着；但是他們仍得容忍，掙扎，工作。　　稻葉上晶瑩的露滴濡濕了各個人的衣衫；稻葉鋒利的邊緣擦破或捋將痛各個人的皮肉。浮塵子發出翁翁的細聲，灰塵樣成團的在各個人的頭上飛舞旋轉，隨後就聚歇在各個人的臉上頸上吮　着，發出難忍的奇癢；但是他們仍得容忍，扎掙，工作。　　中午，一絲風都没有，蒼碧的空中浮着幾朶薄雲，荼毒的陽光直射在遼闊的田野間，酷𤍠滿和在空氣裏面，發揮着盛夏的威力。這時，稻絲没油地在田裏發喘；田塍乾白堅硬，迸出一條條裂痕；田裏的水起着泡沫，灼燙得不能歇脚。　　各個人的背上晒着𤍠辣的陽光，粗大的汗滴從焦黑的皮膚中一粒粒蒸出來，糊成一片，從背上臉上瀑布樣地淌下來。田裏的蒸氣混着猪灰氣泥土氣𤍠烘地向下騰着，衝進每個人的鼻孔，使人氣都透不過來。套着指頭籃（註：耘稻時所用，以竹編成，套在指上，便於拔草。）的手指已酸疲得不能伸屈；傴僂着的腰背已麻痺得不能動彈。他們每個人都有一個感覺；感到他們的身體將爲這灼人的陽光所鎔化。他們雖都有這個感覺，但他們仍得在火𦦨𦦨的陽光中容忍，掙扎，工作。　　容忍！掙扎！工作！但他們仍舊在飢寒交迫中討命女人（六）  沈從文　　但什麽地方有這種農夫？所有農夫皆大半餓死了。這里則面前只是一片砂，一片海民族衰老了，爲本能推動而作成的野蠻事，也不會再發生了。都市中所流行的，只是爲小小利益而出的造謠中傷，與爲稍大利益而出的暗殺誘捕。戀愛則只是閹鷄似的男子，各處扮演着丑角喜劇。　　她想着十個以上的丑角，温習這些自作多情的男子各種不得體的愛情，不愉快的印象。她走着，重復又想着那個不識面的牧師兒子。這男子，十八歲的女子；還只想爲他自殺哩，驕傲的人！流星，就是騎了這流星，也應當把這種男子找到，看他的驕傲，如何消失到温柔雅致體貼親切的友誼應對裏。她記着先前一時那顆流星。　　日光出來了，燒紅了半天。海面一片銀光，爲薄霧所包裏。　　早日正在融解這種薄霧。淸風吹人衣袂如新秋樣子。　　薄霧漸漸融解了，海面光波耀目，如平敷水銀一片，不可逼視。　　眩目的海需要日光，眩目的生活也需要類乎日光的一種東西。這東西在靑年紳士中旣不易發現，就應當在注意另外一處！　　當天那集會裡應當有她主演的一個戲劇，時間將屆時，各處找尋這個人，皆不能見到。有人疑心她或在海邊出了事，海邊却毫無徵兆可得。於是有人又以可笑的測度，說她或者走了，離開這裡了，因此赴她獨自佔據的小帳幕中去尋覓，一點簡單行李雖依然在帳幕裏，却有個小小字條貼在撑柱上，只說：「我不高興再到這裡，我走了，大家還是快樂的打發這個假期罷。」大家方明白這人當眞走了。　　也像一顆流星，流星雖然長逝了，在人人心中，却留下一個光輝奪目的記號。那件事在那個消夏會中成爲一羣人談論的中心，但無一個人明白這標致出衆的女人，爲什麽忽然獨自走去。　　日頭出自東方，她便向東方注意，坐了法國郵船東部海岸走去。她想找尋使她生放活光同時他本身也放光的一種東西。她到了屬於北國的東方另一海濱。　　那里有各地方來的各樣人，有久住南洋帶了椰子氣味的美國水兵，有身著寛博衣裳的三島倭人，有流離異國的北俄，有龐然大腹由國内各處跑來的商人政客，有……</p>

<p>談言說聰明  天方　　某一種人有某一種的聰明，這聰明又隨着各人的地位而不同。譬如當財政部長的希望是「把你的荷包拿出來」，而小民所注意的，却只是袋口的收緊，其間就頗有不同。所以不同的緣故，就在「治者」與「被治者」地位的差别。　　但異地位的人，即在一國之内，不能具不同一樣的聰明，而同地位的異國人，其思想却多有冥契處。這讀了二十四日本報長沙東京兩電可見。（原文錄下）　　二十三日中央社長沙電何鍵擬不日返省（湖南），親自祭孔。　　同日電通社東京電内務省神社局，擬養成國民之敬神思想·謀民族之　　自覺，爲非常時局之思想府策。近已對政府之思想對策委員會提出振興敬神思想之美風，促關係方面之奮起，同時爲積極的活動，得其承認，决趁此機會，向多年懸案之敬神運動，積極進行。　　看完了上面的二個電報，便感想到東京與長沙，「地之相去也，萬有餘里」，而日本的内務省與中國的省主席，英雄所見，可稱略同。這也是凡是統治者所共有的聰明。　　在不久以前，我們曾聽到粤省有讀經之令，現在可有省主席親自祭孔之舉，將來準還有以四子書開科取士，孔道於以大行，夫子有知，定當菀爾而笑，老師宿儒之流，也不必再怨恨民國了，猗歟盛哉！　　特此事不可以皮相，高唱神道設敎者與穿了寛衣博帶誠惶誠恐行三跪九叩首之禮的，大都是心下明白，不懷好意的人。其目的並不是想將他人掀入自己的模型裏，而是想將他人掀入自己所特定的模型裏。　　人總有一種癖性，就是不歡喜他人像自己丨丨或可說不願自己像别人。丨丨向人殷殷勸募的慈善家，頗多不可吿人的秘密；而勸人戒殺放生的僧徒，私下却大都吃肉。一言以蔽之，曰：「作用而已」！　　但「作用」的能否收到實效，是相對的。就是說：聰明人的成立，須看是否有傻子。倘寺院無人布施，僧徒將何以吃肉：慈善的經紀人倘没有人捐助，洋房也何從起建？　　現時中國和日本的社會，頗覺有點騷然，這眞是兩國在上位者所寢寐難安的事。於是「思想統一」與「思想善導」兩個問題便應運而生。但思想這東西最可怪，雖然視之無形，聽之無聲，然而發揮起來，力量却儘偉大，而也不是槍砲命令等威嚇所可奏效的。當局者也知道此路的不通，於是改變方針而爲麻醉。不論「讀經」，「祭孔」與「振興敬神思想」等等，共目的都不外想從廢棄的藥渣中提鍊出一些新的麻醉劑，來給現代有所不煩的人們吃，方法原極高明。所可惜的單戀是永不會產生美滿姻緣的。　　「神道設敎」，恐怕也只是爲政者最末一套把戲吧！四只角子的謎  因　　當我每晚自夜校回家的時候，必定要經　　路，在那兒站着許多粉白脂紅的女性，無聊的站着，我很感覺奇怪，因爲我每天經過這裏，她們老是這樣的站着，「哦！天大𤍠了，她們出來乘凉吧！」我這檥的爲自己解釋着·　　今天晚上，我照例地經過　　路，她們中有三四個人，在綁票般綁着一個穿藍布短衫褲的中年男子，直向一條黑黝黝的弄堂裏推，「啊？在斡什麽？」我自言自語的又在懷欵了。只聴見一個身材肥胖的女子說；「四只角子，」「四只角子。」另一個瘦柴般靑年少女說：「做做好事，請你進去，就二角錢吧！」　　這一團疑雲，實在使我蒙在鼓裏了，想不出一個適當的答案來。她們在斡什麽？三四個女子，拖住了一個男子，還說什麽「二只角子，四只角子。」難道在這剛晚的黃昏時候，男男女女在通衢大道上幹這拉拉拖拖的下流把戲，關心世道的大人先生們見了不說有傷風化和傷風敗俗嗎？似乎以前曾聽見過說是已經廢止禁娼了，大槪今晚所遇見的怪現象，也是關於娼妓賣淫的事吧。　　不多天前在報上讀到關於「德國取締淫風，不良女子授以工作的新聞」裏面有這樣的一段話；「國民十六日柏林電警察今日從事搜查咖啡館及一切傷風敗俗之處所，自德國革命後，數年以來，外國游德者輒對德之風俗有不良之批評，當局乃决計滌除此垢。今外人復作德游者，巳不復有此評論，街中拉客之風巳經禁絶；不良之女子皆經送入工塲，將來凡男子涉足此等處所者，將個主人同科治罪」　　像這樣的事情，德國政府就没有像我們的高明了，因爲在她們的肉上，也的的確確是一塊肥飫的羅掘之所呀！</p>

<p>靑年應有的精神  宜菊　　無疑義地，人生最寳貴的便是靑年時代，靑年時代的心理，是最純潔，同時也最易染汚，　　一個靑年，對於國家和社會，都負有重大的使命，即是對於整個的世界，也負有相當的責任，現代靑年旣是這般的重要，那末現代靑年所有一切精神的重要，不難想見了！同時，要使靑年心理不易染汚，便要實行靑年應有的幾種精神，有了這幾種精神，那靑年心理，或許永久可以保存着純潔，現在將靑年應有的幾種精神，分項述之如下：　　㈠積極的精神有了這種精神以後，思想可以發展，做事能進取，能覺得有興味；而其最大的效力，便是有毅力，孫總理努力革命，失敗計有十九次之多，但他並不因之而灰心，進再舉行第二十次的革命，這種毅力，不是積極精神充分的表現嗎丨　　㈡懷疑的精神目下一般靑年，不論讀書作事，很少有懷疑的精神，一以前人之言爲是，所以一切　的進步，我們要抱有懷疑的精神，只要把「爲什麽」三字拿來問，然復去做，然後去信，這就是「疑而後信」。社會的進化；始於懷疑；政治的改良，也始於懷疑，孫總理的革命，也是始於懷疑，他懷疑中國爲什麽要受外國的欺凌？漢族爲什麽要受滿族的壓迫？懷疑結果，便引起他革命動機，由此可知懷疑精神之重要。　　㈢互助的精神互助精神是人人應具有的，尤其是靑年，我們知道現代一般靑年　多喜自私，只要自己有利，他人的利害，便可抛棄不顧，「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜」。這二句詩，確寫盡中國人一般的心理，外國人稱中國是一盤散沙，也就是指此，但是，我們得明瞭，一椿重大的事件，欲其成就，必有賴於互助，否則，必難達目的。「一木焉能支大厦」，從這句話裏，我們可以找出不少大道理來！　　㈣澈底的精神我們感覺得中國人一切不澈底，所以一切都没有辦法！丨丨讀書而不澈底，决不能獲得眞實的知識；作事而不澈底，决難保有良好的結果，這是毫無疑義的。二十年來抵制日貨的聲浪，無年無之，但是結果又是怎樣？我們捫心自問，眞是慚愧無以言容。這種不澈底的抵制，究何補於實際？靑年們：從今日起，抱起澈底的精神來，努力前進。我將再申前言：一切不澈底，一切無辦法！　　㈠服從團體的精神我們知道，個人的力量，是很狹窄而且有限的：團體的力量，至廣大而且無限，所以要成立大事業，必須要經過團體生活；實在，個人生活，是很枯燥管乏味，團體生活，自較豐潤有趣，是故不論讀書作事，一有團體，就可產生研究興味，而獲得新的進步。但是團體旣然是個人組織而成經濟戰爭的，那未個人自當要有服從團體的精神，以利團體工作的進行，同時，個人還要明瞭：個人固然犧牲了一切，爲團體謀幸福，但是團體原也爲個人謀幸福，所以愛護團體，正是保持個人幸福的一種手段。　　以上五條，在靑年應有精神中，我以爲是很重要的，其餘當然還有許多，但是靑年們如能遵守去幹，便能成個有爲的靑年了。可愛的靑年們：作者抱着無限的𤍠誠，希望你們能遵守　這五個條件，來救我們　危的中國！現代名人書畫　　程兆翔（略歷）　　程朝之字兆翔崇明人山水初學南田後參以唐六如黃雀山樵筆法作山石松樹能自辟門徑畫松不善作針施以焦墨點遠視之别有神韵焉學府通訊  雲人　　㈠游藝會的廣吿　　老王當去西裝褲買了一張XX女校的游藝券，券的反面幾條廣吿說：「XX女士表演之XX節目，係著名女星XX女士派」，「XX女士的粗的腿，黑的臀，十足地表現着健康美」，「哀艶的表情，使人又愛又氣」原來有這多好處，怪不得老王當了褲子也得去啦！　　㈡Ｋｉｓｓ　　蜜司Ｃ刮臉皮羞小王道：「阿要丢臉！給老李Ｋｉｓｓ了，手也不敢回一下」，　　「誰呌他在我們女人跟前佔便宜，這呌做天有眼睛」，蜜司Ｗ狠狠底說着，「小白臉也有喫虧的一天啦」！　　㈢做皇后的前一晚　　「蜜司李，明天當了皇后，可别忘了我這大功臣哩」！接着又是一個聲音「小氣幹嗎？難說我没有功麽，XX日刊上的一張照，我就費了九牛二虎之力」，「還有我呢！大家别爭意氣吧！讓蜜司李向我們這班功臣行個抛吻禮罷」！哈，哈………哈……　　㈣敎務長的一封信XX女士：　　這事千萬不可再推託了，姑娘之盛意，日後自當報效，如XX節目認爲過於………則XX節目應請照顧一下，　　請諸姑娘原諒，言盡於斯，順頌學安　　㈤一個美術敎員　　ＸＸ女生：「不知那個把我小照貼在男生厠所内，請先生澈查」。　　訓育主任：「怎麽？咦，奇怪，你怎知你的小照貼在厠所裏哩」！　　ＸＸ女生：「是，是………一個美術敎員吿訴……我，我的」。　　㈥没兩塊錢就别想做人家表哥　　蜜司Ｑ向她愛人道：「你來看我的時候，不必和門房多嚕囌，只給他兩塊錢，說我來看表妹就是啦」！草坪上的小姑娘  文炳　　雨後新霽，弄後的戰墟的草地上出現了一人個小姑娘。　　小姑娘坐在草地上，頭髪濕淋淋的，衣着也濕淋淋的，像一隻落水鷄。靑色的面孔板着，秀緻的眉毛皺着，髪裏的水，還在分向雙頰一點一點的流，彷佛是晶亮的淚珠。頭　着，兩眼深深地瞪着草地，像在探索什麽似的。　　這情景，一見便知道悲哀罩住了小姑娘的心靈。凑看𤍠鬧的人，誰都帶着一顆好奇的心，誰都想探索小姑娘的究竟。　　「小姑娘，你怎麽坐在這草地上？」人　裏擠出了這麽一句。　　「……」小姑娘不響，　　的年　漫然地在扒草了。　　「小姑娘，說說無妨啦！丨丨難道你不會話麽？」是一個同樣的聲調在追問。　　「………」小姑娘也不點頭，意思是說伊並不是一個　子。　　於是有人在作各種各樣的私議。最得勁的是一個娘姨似的老媽說得口沬飛濺：　　「這小姑娘，倒有些面熟！是的，我記起了！就是桂芳邨我從前的東家的鄰居的丫頭呀！一點不錯，正是這樣一個面孔！聽說看待得很親暱呢，怎會這樣子的？　　「不是的！」小姑娘　然的一句，大家都側目相向，豎起耳根等聽下文。　　「旣不是，你就自己說啦！」又是一個女人聲音。　　「………」小姑娘依舊不響。　　「小姑娘，你餓麽？吃點點心吧！」一位慈仁的婆婆横穿過人縫，放下三隻饅頭在小姑娘的手邊，勸着伊吃，伊才又搖搖頭。　　「幹嗎？」這時來了一個白衣警察，左手斜提着槍枝，右手亂揮着；於是小姑娘抬頭了，淚眼汪汪地。　　「警察來捉了！」一　凑𤍠鬧的孩子嚷着。這　使得小姑娘對答警察的考問　　「我不是丫頭，我是一個小媳婦，現今還剛滿十二歲！是前年娘家漢口漲了大水，才流到上海來的。在輪船上，有位謝先生，看得我起，到了嗎頭，他就招領我到他家裏，說做他的小媳婦，我不知道什麽呌做小媳婦？」　　「謝先生等你還好麽？」警察問：　　「還好！不過……小姑娘停住嘴了。」　　「不過怎樣？丨丨謝先生家在那兒？送你回去好吧！」警察牽扯伊。　　「不，我今年還剛滿十二歲……」小姑娘臉紅了，兩手拱遮住頭部，幾扭幾扭不肯起身。</p>

<p>傀儡  一蘋　　故鄕散記之二　　自從遺產問題的爭執發生，我就不能安居於故鄕，和我的妻子流浪在上海。光陰容易催人老去，更受了社會薰陶，自己兒童時代的生活。早不在記憶之中，於是故鄕也被我遺忘了。這次接到家中的快信，久已平安擱置的遺產風波，又需用我這傀儡來扮演這齣　戲。我别了阿牛父了三人踏進這所破舊的老屋，想起祖上當初創業的時候，是否想到自己幸苦積來的汗血錢，在數十年之後，作爲子孫爭論的目的物？我們張姓創業的住所，這幾年的凋零，和我頦下發戰兢兢地到上海來找職業睹此情况之下祇得　嘆一聲（如此大上海）現無數黑影子同樣的可憐！黑沉沉地步着似曾相識的長巷，一盏昏黃的燈光在前迎接我。出於我意外的客廳上巳坐滿了人，在昏暗弱小的煤油燈下，我也認不識各人面部的輪廓。老媽子首先發見我，「少爺來了」驚動個滿座的人，有的向我點頭，有的直呼我的小名。我隨意的招呼，直覺一陣不可避免的爭鬥就在目前開始。在身旁附近的擠上坐下，像被一種窒息的窒氣限止着，客廳中寂寞得死一樣，幾個渾大的人影照在黝黃的牆壁上，我想起父親死時這間屋子裏的恐怖影像來。秋虫的鳴聲。從隔窗送來，更增添悽凉的回味。我舉起沉重的頭，向在座每個人的面上掃去，族長丨那永遠和靄的老年人，咳了一聲痰，顫着弱小的喉音，被壓迫的煽動這戰爭的導火線：「Ｘ（我的小名）也回來了，說出來大家聽聽」。　　室内起了一陣騷動，二派的人物就在這時候相對壘起來。我靜坐在旁邊，不能參加一句話，也不顧參加一句話，爭論祖宗的遺產，我認爲天下再没有這類可差的事了。各人的話語一句高似一句，幾乎降格我們「詩禮傳家」應有的身分。族長的發言不會使兩方面同時滿意，而兩方面的爭執也永世無和平之時了。我注視着每個人發言的姿勢，作爲消遣砲火下無聊的時間，返過頭來望望老媽子，（她還是我家三代的僕人）她張大了　嘴，驚愕着這些人類的舉動，在我祖父，或者父親時代所認爲大逆不道的：然而在這時候竟毫無顧忌地各人施展各人的「詩禮傳家」後裔的新手段。兩方面爭論劇烈時，置一切調解人於敵對地位，和靄的族長，緩緩地舉起茶杯，但是茶早已在他頻頻舉手時見底了，於是無可奈何地仰首瞧那幾軸不大高明的字晝。姑夫退到我旁邊的座位上，授給我一枝煙，我們燃了望着吐出來的煙圈。終於「明天再談吧！」誰丢了沙帽說，對壘者也覺到舌戰的疲乏，俏俏地宣吿停止。我微笑着送行每一個來客，實行傀儡忠實的一般。　　到臥室去，走過廳屋，瞧見祖父父親的遺像嚴肅地掛在正中，我低着頭不敢逼視他。八·二。於滬上小樓自我職業介紹　　華君蘇省立高中畢業現於某大學文科肄業於國學頗有研究欲於每日下午四時後謀一兼職薪金不計如有家庭聘爲補習國文者更所樂就通訊處由本報業餘周刊轉戲劇戰爭與和平（十一）  凌鶴　　第一幕生與死　　（此時舞台由灰色的微光漸到黑暗，一個排長上場。）　　排長：没有誰跑開嗎？（各士兵應聲起立。）都在這兒嗎？　　兵士乙：回排長，（立正與手）今天晚上不要再跑了麽？　　排長：上面有命令下來：就在這裏過夜。……那個屋子裏以睡嗎？好的。。大家都進去好好的睡一晚罷。你们四個人換班放哨，（指着四個人。）廟門口一個，那邊山坡上（右方）一個，知道麽？口令是……那個老頭兒是誰？你在這裏幹嗎？（指老者）你也該回去了。這麽大的年紀，還不回家去嗎？　　（老者下。排長亦向台左轉去。但給一兵士喊住。）　　兵士乙：回排長，口令是什麽？　　排長：哦，我還没有說出來的。是生死」兩個字。（排長下）　　兵士乙：（少頃）他奶奶的Ｘ，偏是老子脚痛，偏要老子放哨。　　（大家大笑，）其後大家爭着收拾進去。除兵士庚托着槍站在廟門口以外，兵士乙亦滿不高興向台右走去。此時舞台全黑，靜寂，祇有右方遠處，可見一堆紅光，大槪是士兵們偷着煨東西吃的。）　　聲：（兵士乙）口令！……口令！………　　聲：（另一人）老百姓。　　聲：（兵士乙）站着！……舉手！）一聲槍響）舉手！　　（兵士庚離開崗位，向台右去，隨手向天也放了一槍。稍停兵士乙拉着一個靑年農民上來，因着手電筒的照射，模模糊糊可以看得見。）　　兵士乙：他媽的，帶着一個漢奸。　　（兵士庚在那靑年身上摸搜一遍。　　靑年：老總，我不是漢奸，我是古北口逃來的老百姓。　　兵士乙：不是漢奸？那你晚上跑來幹嗎？　　靑年：我有事要見你們官長。　　兵士庚。見官長幹什麽？想行剌嗎？哼可惜你没有這個本領。　　兵士乙：没有什麽好說，帶去見排長罷。　　兵士庚：見排長幹嗎？一粒子彈不就了事嗎？　　兵士甲：（自廟内提着馬燈出來，後面跟着好些人。）什麽事呀？幹嗎開槍？　　兵士庚：捉着一個漢奸，排長在裏面嗎？　　兵士幸：原來這麽一回事啊。那也要大驚小怪的，我以爲日本兵打來了哩。嚇得我魂也没有了。　　兵士乙：魂也没有了嗎？那末我也不是大驚小怪了。哈哈。……排長不在裏面嗎？那末你們看住罷，我找他去。（下）　　兵士戊：他甘心做漢奸，我不能打他嗎？　　兵士甲：你準知道他是漢奸嗎？他是古北口來的老百姓，你聽明白了没有？　　（排長隨着連長的後面上來。兵士們大家讓開。）　　兵士己：剛才不是放了好幾槍嗎？爲什麽没有打中？　　兵士庚：那是空槍你也聽不出來麽。　　兵士幸：這樣哦！進去罷，别躭擱了我的好睡。（獨自進去）　　兵士戊：你媽的！（打他一下耳光）你你幹嗎要做漢奸呀？　　靑年：（欲回手，但不敢）誰是漢奸？我是古北口逃來的老百姓。　　兵士甲：你這個混蛋，（指兵士戊）你爲什麽打人幹嗎？</p>

<h3>Jilin Troops Arrive in Shangdu</h3>
<p>Their Purpose is to Connect with Kulun</p>
<p>Commander Song Orders Gao Shuxun's Troops to Intercept</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu Hopes to Obtain a Title</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Requests Expansion of Troop Numbers</p>
<p>Ruan Xuanwu's Troops Enter and Station Themselves at Daqinggou</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, and Hou Ying, along with a unit of guards, returned to Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 29th, arriving at 7 PM. After disembarking, they immediately met with Jiang and Pang. It is reported that the Jilin troops have arrived in Shangdu, with the intention of occupying it to connect with Kulun. This location is situated on the border of Chahar Province, close to the Zhangjiakou-Kulun highway, and has ample food supplies. Upon receiving the report from Zhangbei, Song immediately dispatched Wang Ziliang and ordered Gao Shuxun's troops nearby to intercept them, preventing future trouble. Xu Yongchang telegraphed Song and Jiang, stating that he has dispatched capable troops to defend the area. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan went to Mantoushan at noon on the 28th for inspection and returned to Zhangbei at 5 PM. He scheduled his return to Zhangjiakou for the 29th. Fang Zhenwu has arrived in Duolun, accompanied by Wang Zhongfu. After Chen Xiwen and Zhang Yunrong met with Fang, they reported to Song that Fang wishes to relocate for recuperation, hoping the government will first grant him a title. His troops will be managed by Song. Ji led his troops through Daqinggou, retreating towards western Chahar. On the night of the 27th, Ji's troops reached Erjizi, where they were surrounded by Zhang Lingyun's troops and had over a hundred guns and over a hundred supply vehicles confiscated. Over three hundred people were captured. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The troops accompanying Fang Zhenwu to Duolun numbered only three to four hundred. After Ji headed towards northern Chahar, there were still three to four thousand followers. Ji's division commanders, Zhang Lingyun and Nie Yuling, have returned to Zhangbei. Ji is prepared to travel elsewhere alone, with his troops led by Zhang Mutao. Liu Guitang's troops number approximately seven thousand, with three to four thousand guns. They are currently stationed inside and outside Duolun. Liu was originally a bandit army, prone to fickleness. Although he has expressed a willingness to be incorporated, his sincerity is difficult to predict. The Chahar authorities, to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, cannot but increase their vigilance. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities are currently planning a swift resolution for Fang and Ji's troops. Fang, leading Wang Zhongfu's troops, fled from Duolun to Chicheng yesterday and should arrive today. The authorities have dispatched Feng Qinzhai's troops to advance towards Longguankou, monitoring the actions of Fang Zhenwu and Liu Guitang's troops in Chicheng. On one hand, Song telegraphed Fang, advising him to quickly leave the military and hand over his troops to the government for reorganization. Fang hopes to be granted a title before leaving the military, but the authorities are determined to have Fang leave the military first, with the matter of a title not yet discussed. If Fang still refuses to comply, they are determined to take appropriate measures for a swift resolution. Ji's troops fled from Zhangbei towards Pingdiquan, pursued by Zhang Lingyun's cavalry brigade. Fu Zuoyi has also dispatched cavalry to intercept them at Yong'anbao. The majority of Ji's troops are in the Daqinggou area, and the authorities will thoroughly resolve this issue. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang sent his adjutant to Zhangjiakou requesting an expansion of troop numbers. The authorities, due to the complexity of Liu's troops and the heavy burden, have expressed their refusal. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou dispatch: Ruan's troops, under Song's command, entered Daqinggou and then transferred to Shangdu. Ruan reported to Zhang via telegram on the morning of the 29th that Fang Zhenwu and Wang Zhongfu arrived in Duolun on the 28th. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng returned to Beiping to report to He after waiting for Song's return to Zhangjiakou. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Song Zheyuan reported arriving in Zhangbei on the 26th. Fang Zhenwu led a small unit of Wang Zhongfu's troops and fled east to Duolun. The majority of his troops were taken in by Ruan Xuanwu and are awaiting reorganization in Zhangbei. Ji's troops, infected with communist elements, fled west to Shangdu. The majority of his troops were taken in by Zhang Yunrong and are awaiting reorganization in Zhangbei. Regarding the reorganization and disbandment measures, those willing to return to farming will be sent back to their hometowns. Those originally from local militias will be returned to their respective areas. In addition to strict screening to minimize the size of the force, cavalry has been dispatched to pursue all troops fleeing west with Ji, and telegrams have been sent to the garrisons in Shanxi and Suiyuan to block and suppress them, striving for complete annihilation. Fang is at a loss and has nowhere to return, but there may still be an opportunity for him to reform. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou dispatch: Song Zheyuan stayed in Zhangbei on the 28th and told reporters that after Fang Zhenwu left Zhangbei, he sent Chen Xiwen and Zhang Yunrong to catch up by car. Fang indicated that he would first go to Duolun and then contact them by long-distance telephone as needed. Ji Hongchang arrived at Yanhou Ertai on the 29th and spoke with him once by telephone. Ji intends to secretly go to Tianjin and has headed towards western Chahar, planning to go to Pingdiquan. On the night of the 27th, he received a telegram from the Baochang County Magistrate reporting that the area is peaceful, proving the rumors of its loss to be inaccurate. He plans to return to Zhangjiakou immediately and then inspect the six counties and states outside the pass to deal with the aftermath of the Chahar incident. Since Fang and Ji have already left the province, everything can be considered concluded. Ji Hongchang, Zhang Mutao, Xuan Xiafu, and others have departed from Daqinggou towards Daba, heading for Fengzhen and Pingdiquan in Suiyuan Province. The Suiyuan provincial authorities have taken notice and are on strict guard. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

Sheng has drafted a reorganization plan, intending to form four brigades, and has submitted it to the central government for instructions. A decision should be made shortly.

<p>Tense Situation in Eastern Chahar</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops Concentrated in Guyuan Seem to be Planning an Invasion Westward</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou dispatch: It has been raining heavily in Zhangjiakou since the 28th, and the rain has not stopped by the morning of the 29th. Cheng Xiwen called to report to Song that the puppet troops and Tang's troops in eastern Chahar are concentrated in Guyuan and are active westward. Song ordered Feng's entire division to gather in Zhangbei. Baochang and Kangbao are as usual, but there are many local miscellaneous troops, and the people are panicked. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song plans to deploy elite troops to take charge of the defenses of Kangbao in eastern Chahar. Representatives of the people from sixteen counties in Chahar Province, including Qiao Shiping, have gathered in Zhangjiakou, awaiting an audience with Song to request that the government allocate relief funds. The disaster in the counties of eastern Chahar is particularly severe, with many households emptied due to farmers fearing being drafted, leading to widespread wasteland of crops. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Instructs the Envoy to Cuba</p>
<h3>To Begin Negotiations for Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) There are approximately 20,000 Chinese living in Cuba. Due to the absence of a Sino-Cuban commercial treaty, they are subject to the treatment of citizens from non-treaty countries. They have repeatedly appealed, but progress has been hindered by political unrest in Cuba. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that the political situation in Cuba has stabilized, has responded to the request of the Chinese living in Cuba by instructing the envoy to Cuba, Ling Bing, to begin preliminary negotiations with the Cuban government. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Railways Raises Funds to Build a New Yellow River Bridge</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway has exceeded its safe service life. It was tilted and presented extreme danger during the recent flooding. Several years ago, the railway planned to raise millions of yuan in batches each year to build a new bridge, but the funds were entirely appropriated by northern warlords, and the construction of the new bridge was put on hold.

<p>Continued Disasters in Many Places in the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River</p>
<h3>Thirty-one Breaches at Shitou Village, Collapse of the Lijiaba Embankment in Huimin County</h3>
<p>Troops Protecting the Dike Return to Defend as the Water Level Drops at Luokou</p>
<p>(Jinan) The situation in the lower reaches of the Yellow River remains tense. The Lijiaba embankment in Huimin County on the north bank continues to collapse. Water is accumulating at the Dazhe Dike at Yuwangkou Dam in Qidong County on the south bank. A large landslide of thirty to forty zhang has shifted the riverbank opposite Zhengjia, directly impacting Scorpion Bay. The stone dam has already been inundated by more than one zhang. The main road is flooded by four to five inches and is being protected. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Sun Qingze, Director of the Jihe River Affairs Bureau, arrived in Jinan and stated that there are thirty-one breaches at Shitou Village, with sixteen still overflowing. 300,000 yuan is needed to close the breaches. However, the newly silted riverbed is one and a half feet higher than the embankment. If the embankment is not raised, the floodwaters will overflow and if the overflow happens from Liuzhuang, not only Caozhou will be submerged, but there is also a danger of the river changing its course. Raising the embankment by five feet and widening it by five zhang would require over 1 million yuan. Jihe does not have the financial resources and has decided to report to the central government in Nanjing. The number of people buried alive in the mud and sand at the breaches is difficult to count. The River Affairs Bureau has used seventeen boats to rescue over 4,000 people who have escaped to rooftops and trees, and over 10,000 have escaped to the top of the embankment. This is only in the vicinity of Shitou Village. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Finance Department Orders Tobacco Merchants to Subscribe to Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Requests that the Guangdong Provincial Government Stop This</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guangdong Finance Department ordered Guangdong tobacco merchants to subscribe to government bonds. The Ministry of Finance specifically requested the Guangdong Provincial Government to investigate and cancel this order, stating, "According to reports, since January 1, the Guangdong Provincial Government has ordered all tobacco merchants to subscribe to government bonds at a rate of 20% of the tax amount for each carton of cigarettes. The tobacco merchants believe that this is an additional burden and are unwilling to comply. They have now stopped affixing tax stamps and are vigorously negotiating with the authorities, but the stalemate has not been resolved. Please telegraph the Guangdong authorities to withdraw the order as soon as possible, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants." The Ministry believes that the "Regulations for the Collection of Unified Tobacco Tax" promulgated by the National Government stipulate that all cigarettes that have paid the unified tax and affixed sufficient tax stamps are permitted for sale, and provinces must not re-levy or add any taxes or fees. Guangdong cigarettes have already paid the unified tax, and in the event of promoting the sale of government bonds, it can only be properly solicited based on each merchant's ability to fulfill their obligations. If government bonds are apportioned based on the number of cigarette cartons at a rate of 20%, it is tantamount to an additional tax, which clearly violates the regulations and should be investigated and stopped to avoid undermining the tax system. Accordingly, this is communicated to the Guangdong Provincial Government for investigation and the prompt cancellation of the aforementioned method of apportioning based on cartons to maintain the tax system. We await your reply. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Prime Minister Inspects Border Fortifications</h3>
<p>Declares France Needs Freedom and Peace</p>
<p>Will Resolutely Resist Any Intentional Border Violations</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Minister of War of France, Daladier, recently inspected border defense projects in eastern France. Today, he met with journalists there and made a statement, saying, "France does not provoke anyone, but if anyone invades France, it will resolutely resist in any case. The national defense is now solid, and there is no fear of foreign insults. Those who participated in this project have contributed to the country and are grateful in the name of the state." The Prime Minister will go to the Strasbourg defense zone tomorrow to inspect national defense projects. (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since Prime Minister Daladier announced France's resolution to guarantee Austria's independence, he has set off to inspect fortresses along the German border. This matter has aroused deep concern in French political circles. Before he set off to inspect, he published an article, stating, "France needs peace. Our responsibility lies in consolidating our freedom. But to ensure this freedom, we must first let people know that we have the ability to maintain freedom. At the same time, we must always observe and ensure that the resolutions and regulations established by the League of Nations and the Hague Tribunal are observed unswervingly." (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that yesterday, more than 100,000 Germans held a demonstration in front of the national monument on the Nitterwald Mountain on the Rhine River. It happened that French Prime Minister Daladier was also inspecting the fortresses of Alsace-Lorraine at that time. Therefore, French newspapers believe that Daladier's move has the significance of confronting the German demonstration. The Saar region of the Rhine basin has Germany's hope of regaining its return to the country, which poses a great threat to France. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Austria Reforms Military System in Vienna</h3>
<p>The government announced that it intends to obtain the consent of the countries that signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain (i.e., the peace treaty with Austria) and will establish a civil defense force. Austrian newspapers have expressed satisfaction with this move, saying that the Treaty of Saint-Germain allows Austria to have an army of 30,000 men, but Austria currently has an army of only 20,000 men. In the future, Austria will adopt a civil defense system, which is actually the first step towards compulsory military service. This kind of compulsory military service is expected to maintain a standing army of 20,000 men, and another 8,000 to 10,000 men will be recruited every six months. Their military training will be limited to six months, but the military service of special forces can continue for up to one year. Another advantage of this system is that it can reduce the number of unemployed people. This is also very valuable, because a large number of unemployed young people can be incorporated into the army from now on. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Border Dispute Between Belgium and Germany</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another incident occurred at the border between Belgium and Germany in Liège. In the evening, Belgian gendarmes encountered a uniformed member of the Hitler Party riding a horse in the area of ​​Moraisle. After questioning by the gendarmes, he claimed to be lost, so they took him back to the border and released him. On the same day, in the area of ​​Lorraine, five members of the Hitler Party, four in uniform and one in plain clothes, paraded there, insulting local residents. The gendarmes rushed to investigate upon hearing the news. When the members of the Hitler Party saw the gendarmes arriving, they fled back to German territory. After the gendarmes left, they returned to the original place and continued to insult. When the gendarmes arrived for the second time, the members of the Hitler Party tried to escape again, and the one in plain clothes threw a wine bottle at a gendarme, injuring his head. The person who threw the bottle was immediately arrested. A helmet worn by a member of the Hitler Party was found at the scene of the incident. The prosecutor of Weerweyer will investigate this matter. In addition, a Belgian businessman recently returned from Germany and was detained for two days in Düsseldorf, Germany. The reason was that the Belgian was carrying more than 200 marks and made a transaction there, both of which violated the ban. (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>German Police Cross Border to Arrest People</h3>
<p>Swiss Government Lodges Protest</p>
<p>(Paris) The Swiss people are furious because German officials have repeatedly disturbed the border. The Swiss government has lodged a protest with Berlin. The most recent case involved a Czech man who was engaged in smuggling sugar into Germany. He was arrested by three men claiming to be German police officers 300 yards from the border. During the scuffle, he lost a lot of blood and was eventually dragged into German territory. Swiss customs officials tried to help this unfortunate Czech, but they were no match for the three Germans. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Meets British and American Financial Leaders</h3>
<p>White House Claims Meeting Was Purely Social</p>
<p>France Monitors Progress of British and American Monetary Policies</p>
<p>Hyde Park, according to a statement by the White House Secretary, today the US President and the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, only talked about the weather, sea voyages, and boat trips. They spent part of their time visiting the Summer White House (i.e., the President's private residence) and did not mention the issue of stabilizing currencies. Norman's visit to the President was purely social. The White House Secretary did not indicate whether Norman would visit the US President again before returning to England, or whether he would have a long conversation with the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Harrison, and the Undersecretary of the Treasury, Acheson. He refused to give detailed answers to the questions asked by reporters, and repeatedly stated that the visit was purely social. According to New York bankers, the meeting between the US President and Norman will discuss the issue of stabilizing currencies, so the outside world is paying close attention to this. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Situation of the French Franc is Precarious</h3>
<p>(Paris) French financial authorities are now watching the progress of British and American currencies with keen eyes. Both the pound and the dollar are trending downwards, and the danger to the French franc can happen at any time. Financial authorities also acknowledge that this final crisis is not far away. Britain's policy of depressing the pound in line with the dollar for business purposes has been well known. But the question is how long can France's foreign trade withstand the depreciation of the currencies of the two major Anglo-Saxon countries. The statement made by the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium at the annual meeting today that the gold franc can maintain the gold standard is somewhat reassuring. There is no special speculative activity on the Paris Stock Exchange, but it is not much different from last year. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Various Speculations Abound</h3>
<p>(New York) The purpose of the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman's visit to the United States continues to arouse speculation in all quarters. The banking sector is convinced that Norman's visit is not purely social, because it is known that Norman believes that the stability of the pound and dollar exchange rates is the key to world recovery. Although officials claim that Norman's tea party talks with Harrison and other important people do not foreshadow an immediate change in US financial policy, it is generally expected that the Governor of the Bank of England's visit may influence President Roosevelt's future policies. It is likely that President Roosevelt will not hastily adopt any new monetary policies until his recovery movement has yielded results. However, Norman will definitely argue that a temporary plan to stabilize exchange rates will not only not hinder, but also help the US recovery movement. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>The Paris "Economic and Financial News Agency" published a message from New York, analyzing the talks between President Roosevelt and the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman. It is said that although officials claim that the meeting between Roosevelt, Norman, and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Harrison, was purely social in nature, it is not credible. Norman's attempt to get the US government to stabilize the dollar has failed. When they met on Monday, there was no formal development. Roosevelt was quite clever and turned the meeting into a summer suburban lunch. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>US Restoration of Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Not Yet the Right Time</p>
<p>Hyde Park, it is generally believed that although President Roosevelt is prepared to issue a statement on stabilizing currencies, he believes that the time is not yet right. Roosevelt intends to allow the dollar to fluctuate freely away from the gold standard in order to reach a point where its exchange rate with other countries' currencies is stable. In addition, he also wants to understand whether countries that are currently adhering to the gold standard and have budget deficits can maintain the gold standard to the end. Therefore, Roosevelt intends to consider restoring the international gold standard only when the above questions have been answered satisfactorily, but will never consider it in advance. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>US Recovery Program</h3>
<p>Relief Agency Establishes Lending Institution</p>
<p>Assists Businesses Complying with Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, 28th - President Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Ickes today discussed a plan to promote the recovery program. After the conversation, Ickes told reporters that he advocated that those who have not started the recovery program within the specified period should not be given the distribution of relief funds. President Roosevelt today ordered the Financial Relief Agency to establish an institution to quickly provide temporary loans and relief to businesses affiliated with the National Recovery Administration, so that businesses can tide over the period of sudden increase in expenses and temporary lack of income.</p>
<h3>US Government Announces Reduction in Wheat Production</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th - Secretary of Agriculture Wallace today formally announced a 15% reduction in the acreage of wheat planted in the United States. This measure was decided two days ago. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace estimated that wheat fields would be reduced by 9.6 million acres, and wheat production would be reduced by 124 million bushels. The Secretary of Agriculture also said that the supplementary measures to the London Agreement proposed by the United States are expected to be signed on August 29. However, the Secretary of Agriculture did not announce the content of this supplementary measure. National Recovery Administration Executive Officer General Johnson today stated that labor and management of coal mines have reached a consensus on the basis of coal mining regulations.</p>

It is heard that officials of the Pan-American Union are putting pressure on Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Colombia to force them to release their disputes and reconcile, and to engage in the reorganization of economic issues.</p>
<h3>Moley's Resignation Statement</h3>
<p>Declares There is Absolutely No Grudge with Hull</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 28th - Under Secretary of State Moley's resignation has been approved. Moley recently declared that although he will implement his resignation in early September, he will continue to investigate the issue of crime until mid-September. He also said that he has long discussed with financier Astor the publication of a new magazine.

<p>National, Washington, 28th - Dr. Moley has declared to the public that he has absolutely no misunderstanding or grudge with Secretary of State Hull. Hull also expressed surprise at Moley's resignation as Under Secretary of State. The political circles here no longer mention this matter. Today, it is rare to talk about Moley again.

<h3>Japan's Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese diplomatic authorities have been closely watching the actions of the Chinese government after Minister Song returns to China on the one hand, and the attitude of European and American countries towards China in the future on the other hand. Its purpose is to separate our country's cooperation with the League of Nations and implement the proposal of direct negotiations between China and Japan in order to achieve its goal of monopolizing China's rights. This is known to everyone. However, if the Japanese want to achieve this goal, they must first ask themselves why the proposal of direct negotiations with China has been advocated for a long time, but our people have not shown any signs of agreeing to it. Why have they repeatedly used deceptive and intimidating methods towards Europe and the United States to alienate our good feelings with Europe and the United States? Why have all countries not only not trusted Japan, but also expressed opposition, causing Japan to fall into such a state of isolation? If the Japanese can think deeply about the reasons and suddenly realize it, then today they will definitely not use their previous policy of aggression, but will fundamentally change their diplomatic policy. This is also obvious. However, judging from its recent expressions, there is no sincerity in changing. It was previously reported that Japan's diplomatic policy would change, but now it is said that Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has not changed. It was previously reported that diplomatic relations with Europe and the United States would be established individually, but now it is said that careful attention must be paid and there is no need to go to great lengths. On the surface, it seems that it is ambiguous, but in fact, its policy has always been consistent and has never changed slightly. When Uchida came to power, he declared that even if "the whole country is turned into scorched earth, it must maintain Manchuria." This kind of scorched earth diplomacy, which was passed down for a while, although it was ridiculed by the domestic people and criticized by international public opinion, the authorities did have this determination. Today, although they do not explicitly continue to advocate the high-profile of scorched earth diplomacy, in fact, their so-called continental policy has not changed slightly.</p>
<p>We carefully examine the current situation in Japan and silently observe the current situation in the world, and we can know that Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has not changed its traditional ideas and methods. In other words, it is still continuing its policy of aggression. Today, the declaration that the diplomatic policy towards China will not be changed is nothing more than two meanings. One is to declare to the Japanese people that its diplomacy is still following the old path in order to maintain people's hearts. The other is to declare to the world that Japan's position towards China shows no remorse. In this case, is there still hope for improvement in Sino-Japanese relations? Is there still a possibility of establishing peace in East Asia? Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces two years ago, 30 million people have been trampled on by the Japanese army and have been crying out endlessly with no one to tell. The Japanese army has also used the so-called security of the Manchurian puppet state as an excuse to send troops deep into the territory within the Great Wall. In the Beining Road area, they have used the Boxer Protocol as an excuse to not only harm the people, but also create bandits and endanger the people. In areas outside the railway, such as Xinglong, they have forcibly occupied it, and in areas such as Miyun, they have stubbornly refused to withdraw their troops. From Yuguan to Qinhuangdao, it is completely in the hands of the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese army has also instigated Li Shouxin's troops from the puppet state to disturb Dolon again. According to this phenomenon, Japan is not only disregarding international credibility and trampling on our country's sovereignty, but also denying the Tanggu Agreement, which has not yet dried its ink. Then, its so-called unchanging policy towards China is to not change its old tricks of aggression.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the September 18th Incident two years ago, no one in our country has ever recognized Japan's division of our territory as reasonable, and no one has ever agreed with Japan's theory of friendship. Then, from where will the so-called direct negotiations start? Moreover, the Japanese army's budget for 1934 has a new requirement of 210 million yen. The navy's new requirement reaches 430 million yen. The total basic budget of the army, including the Manchurian Incident expenses, must be 575 million yen. The navy must spend 680 million yen. Spending such huge military expenses, is it not a daydream to talk about peace? From this point of view, Japan is still continuing its traditional policy of aggression towards China, and is only using peace as a mask towards Britain and other countries. Its so-called unchanging diplomatic policy is to not change its implementation of armament. Alas, Japan's diplomatic policy is like this, what should our country's response be?</p>
<h3>Scorched Earth Diplomacy Tends to Coordination Uchida is Under Attack from Military and Zaibatsu</h3>
<p>Military Clique Plans to Support Matsuoka to Take Power</p>
<p>Uchida Once Had the Intention to Resign</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Dongbao newspaper, Foreign Minister Uchida submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Saito in Hayama and expressed that he would not attend today's cabinet meeting. The reason why Saito persuaded Uchida to give up the idea of resigning was that he was under attack from both the military and the zaibatsu. The military clique forced Foreign Minister Uchida to implement a tough diplomacy, which is tantamount to declaring war on Japan by Europe and the United States. Uchida also believes that this kind of policy is not a diplomatic policy that is loyal to the country. On the one hand, he is also moved by the zaibatsu's economic first policy. From scorched earth diplomacy, he gradually tends to the coordination diplomacy before the September 18th Incident. The military clique believes that this kind of policy is very unfavorable to the military's warmongering policy and secretly excludes Foreign Minister Uchida. It also makes its factional fascist group promote Matsuoka Yosuke, a diplomatic hero created by the military, to become foreign minister. However, Matsuoka Yosuke's attitude is very negative. It is heard that since returning to the country from Europe and the United States, Matsuoka has deeply felt that doing diplomacy with empty patriotic feelings will bring disaster to the country in the future. He has been deeply hidden in the mountains since returning to the country and is unwilling to express his opinions, hoping to make the people gradually calm down before he can determine a century-old plan for the country. Matsuoka Yosuke also expressed his feelings in the September issue of Bungei Shunju. Therefore, this kind of movement by the military, judging from the domestic and foreign situation, still lacks the possibility of realization at present. (China United Press Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Major Changes in Foreign Envoys</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from the Japanese political circles, there will be a major change in the foreign ambassadors and ministers of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in mid-September. The Ambassador to France has requested leave to return to the country, and the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira Tsuneo, will also retire. Ambassador to the United States Debuchi is also about to resign due to the military's exclusion. It is heard that the Chief of the Palace Ministry, Hayashi Shiki, has expressed his intention to resign. It is planned to recommend Matsudaira, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, as his successor. Ambassador Matsudaira is the father-in-law of Prince Chichibu, the Emperor's younger brother, and is also a descendant of the nobility. The Japanese Emperor will confer the title of Baron on Matsudaira Tsuneo, so that Matsudaira can rejoin the nobility. (China United Press Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Asks for US Consent</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke, who was active in the world in Geneva, arrived in Tokyo on the 25th and is currently staying in Nikko. Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu sent a special envoy to Matsuoka's residence to ask him to take the post of Ambassador to the United States. Foreign Minister Uchida said that Matsuoka Yosuke will return to Tokyo at the end of the month and will formally negotiate at that time. Whether Matsuoka will agree is unknown, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is doing its best to persuade him.</p>

<h3>Seiyu Party President Suzuki Responds to Saito's Visit</h3>
<p>Presents the So-called Specific National Policy</p>
<p>Spiritual Understanding Has Been Achieved</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suzuki, the President of the Seiyu Party, visited Prime Minister Saito at his private residence in Yotsuya Nakamachi this morning for the second meeting. The spiritual agreement was established at the first meeting, and the general outline of the national policy was also largely agreed upon. Today, opinions will be exchanged frankly and honestly on individual policies. Prime Minister Saito must consider the intentions of the cabinet and the Minsei Party and cannot immediately express his opinion for or against. However, an attempt will be made to make a compromise agreement on the Seiyu Party's agreement plan. Those that cannot be implemented will be deleted. The principle is that no matter who thinks it is necessary in the current extraordinary situation. Therefore, the national policy agreement is expected to proceed smoothly. In addition, it is reported that when President Suzuki visited Prime Minister Saito this morning, since the first meeting did not discuss specific policies, this time he presented the agreement plan drafted by the Seiyu Party and explained the intentions of the Seiyu Party. The Prime Minister also explained the course of the meeting with Watsuki, the President of the Minsei Party, and Adachi. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes, and President Suzuki left at 9:20 am. (Dentsu News Agency Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Five Major Policies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Suzuki, the President of the Seiyu Party, who visited Prime Minister Saito this morning, presented the Seiyu Party's policy, which contains five major policies. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Now that we have withdrawn from the League of Nations, the Naval Treaty has been changed, the world's industrial lines are under heavy pressure, the national economy is uneasy, and ideological incidents occur frequently, the internal and external situation is pressing and extraordinary, and there is a feeling of entering the second phase. At this time, our party, in accordance with the established guiding policy, advocates the following items: ㈠ Establishment of diplomatic policy and enrichment of national defense preparation: Establish diplomatic policies towards the League of Nations, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, etc., and implement the revitalization of diplomatic agencies. In terms of national defense, establish the fundamental policy of Manchuria and mandated territories as the first line, and develop industry simultaneously, without any omissions. ㈠ The Japan-Manchuria issue: To adjust the formation of the Japan-Manchuria economic alliance, and according to the principle of mutual communication, plan to procure funds, cotton, wool, fuel, etc., to strengthen the foundation of the country. ㈠ Economic and industrial issues: Prevent imports, increase exports, and strive to achieve the party's established industrial plan for the purpose of increasing national income. Implement the improvement of the financial system to maintain and develop the middle class, and focus all efforts on the implementation of fundamental measures to prevent unemployment. ㈠ Reform administration: Implement fundamental improvements to various systems to improve the education system and seek to improve education and cultivate national thought. ㈠ Financial issues: Implement methods to eliminate waste as much as possible, and at the same time, seek ways to increase revenue, such as fundamental improvements in official industries, to establish the foundation of finance. (Dentsu Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Stabilize People's Hearts</h3>
<p>In addition to the above five major policies, the so-called transcendence issue is a plan to guide national thought. The stability of people's hearts is the fundamental condition for national governance. If it is despised, there is no way to implement true politics. Our party's future advocacy is to open up the current situation with the demands of the majority of the people, so we are convinced that this is the most effective countermeasure. (Dentsu Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Approval</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito reported to today's regular cabinet meeting the situation of his visits to the three presidents, Suzuki, Watsuki, and Adachi, and the content of his second meeting with Suzuki, the President of the Seiyu Party. Afterwards, he said that the Seiyu Party had submitted a memorandum on the national policy agreement and wanted to implement the policy in accordance with this policy. If the government made a proposal, it hoped to adopt the main purpose of the memorandum and consider making a concrete proposal. It is also reported that the main purpose of the case is largely consistent with the government's opinion, so it is planned to consult with various government agencies before implementing it and ask for the understanding of each cabinet member. After requesting the approval of each cabinet member, each cabinet member had no objection and immediately approved it. (Dentsu Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Attitude of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito has met with the presidents of the three parties regarding the policy agreement issue. It is reported that he hopes to meet with the House of Peers soon. According to the observation of the influential people in the House of Peers, each faction in the House of Peers is different from the political parties and has no doctrines or policies. Although they are asked to cooperate, no one is willing to take responsibility. Although the Prime Minister requested a meeting with the House of Peers, it was only to report on the progress of the agreement issue and seek their understanding. It is possible to gather the negotiating committees of each faction for a meeting. It is feared that it will wait for Speaker Konoe to return to Tokyo to meet with the Speaker and Deputy Speakers. In short, it is only a formality and has no important political significance. (Dentsu Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Criticisms from All Sides</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyūkai's national policy has not received favorable comments from all quarters. The Minseitō stated that the content of the policy is too abstract and that the party has no need to express agreement or disagreement. The Seiyūkai representative's future visit will be limited to hearing their explanation, and no major opinions will be exchanged. The Kokumin Dōmei stated that the party would never accept the Seiyūkai's policy and that established political parties should be dissolved quickly. The House of Peers also stated that it had no value and that the Minseitō and Kokumin Dōmei parties would definitely not swallow it whole. According to the army's opinion, President Suzuki's presentation of abstract opinions today is not worth criticizing. Suzuki should have known what the public thinks of political parties. If he recognizes this extraordinary situation, he does not need to re-emphasize abstract opinions and should immediately join the cabinet alone to allow the cabinet to decisively implement various national policies.

<h3>Japanese Navy Authority Explains the Purpose of Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Cannot Ignore the Expansion of the US Navy</p>
<p>Resolve to Repel Foreign Enemies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to foreign dispatches, people related to the Geneva disarmament conference claimed that the Japanese-American naval construction competition may induce a Japanese-American war. Therefore, the people concerned are quite worried. Colonel Sekine of the Japanese Navy Ministry issued the following statement on the 28th regarding this issue: The saying that the intense shipbuilding competition between Japan and the United States will trigger a war is merely an argument made by someone with a certain agenda. Japan has no intention of actively confronting the navies of other countries, but when other countries actively begin actions that infringe on Japan's rights and interests, and the lives of the Japanese people are threatened, Japan must repel foreign enemies. Japan recognized the London Treaty with attached conditions. Although countries are implementing large-scale shipbuilding plans without exceeding the scope of the treaty, Japan cannot ignore it. Therefore, Japan builds warships because it is stimulated by other countries, but the outside world believes that Japan's attitude is to incite war. This statement is the most harmful propaganda.

I have repeatedly reported from this province that I am extremely anxious and earnestly hope that you will instruct the relevant agencies to quickly allocate huge sums to immediately provide relief.

The southwest of Shandong Province has been particularly severely damaged. Within hundreds of miles, humans and livestock have been swept away.

<h3>Henan Provincial Government Telegraphed Request for Thorough Investigation of Fabricated Charges</h3>
<p>Regarding the Lankao Flood</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai reported that a special dispatch from Jinan on the 25th said that representatives of 18 counties in western Shandong, including Heze and Shouzhang, telegraphed the central government, accusing the chairman of Henan Province of sending a brigade of soldiers to Lankao, using the pretext of protecting the dikes to breach the dikes and flood 18 counties in western Shandong. An investigation of the current flood in Lankao shows that the authorities in Henan Province only ordered river workers and the county magistrate to hire laborers and make every effort to protect the dikes. They did not send troops to rescue them. In the end, the water level rose and overflowed the new dike into the old course of the Yellow River. The deputy director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Wang Yingyu, and the deputy chief engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, Xu Kai, personally inspected Lankao. The facts are clear and sufficient to prove that the representatives' claims are entirely fabricated and distort the truth. The Henan Provincial Government has telegraphed the central government, requesting that a senior official be sent to thoroughly investigate and severely punish those responsible, and has telegraphed Chairman Han for investigation to clarify the truth.

<h3>Cat Born with Two Wings</h3>
<p>Reuters, London Correspondence: The folk tales of cats having nine lives and nine-tailed cats are widely known. Recently, a peculiar cat was discovered in Oxford, with two wings growing on its back, each four inches long, covered in black and white fur. Although it cannot flap its wings and take flight, observers say it has tried to fly, but cannot lift its body off the ground. The cat is quite large and fat, and its meowing and fondness for mice and fish are the same as ordinary cats. It was abandoned on the roadside and is now being kept in the Oxford Zoo. Superstitious English people are unwilling to look at this deformed creature, so if its original owner cannot be found to return it, it is planned to kill it.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui's Troops Scatter After Defeat</h3>
<p>Chen Hongwen Captured, Shi Zhaowu Killed</p>
<p>Peng Chengfu Defects to the Enemy, Liu Wencai Assassinated</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Soldiers Remain Out of the Original Hundred Thousand</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Following Liu Wenhui's defeat, the situation has become one of complete collapse. Chen Hongwen, commander of the 2nd Sichuan-Kang Division, and Wu Yuanhu, commander of the 4th Division, both from Liu's forces, surrendered to Deng Xihou and Luo Zezhou when they retreated in the Chongqing area. Over forty companies were incorporated into Deng and Luo's forces. Chen and Wang had recently been won over by Liu Wenhui, so even though there was talk of returning to Deng's command, they remained hesitant and never dared to break away from Liu Wenhui resolutely. A few days ago, Liu Wenhui convened a meeting of generals in Xinjin, but none of the generals attended except for Chen Hongwen, who arrived as scheduled. Liu Wenhui, in his disappointment, held Chen Hongwen's hand, expressing his gratitude. Chen also seemed deeply moved, indicating his willingness to follow him to the end. Finally, they parted in tears. Therefore, after Deng's army crossed the river, Chen and Wang still refused to change their allegiance. It was not until Deng commanded the troops at Chuanxindian and Luo Zezhou also advanced that Chen dared not openly oppose Deng. However, Wang Yuanhu's troops engaged in a major battle with Luo's division. The officers and soldiers of Chen and Wang's forces regarded Deng and Luo as their former superiors. Once contact was made, they defected one after another. Chen only led six regiments to retreat to Qionglai. Huang Xixuan, Cheng Zimin, and Yang Shuxian, the brigade commanders of this unit, sent representatives to surrender to Deng, who appointed them as brigade commanders. Huang's unit was planned to be placed under the command of Chen Shunen, while Cheng and Yang's brigades were placed directly under the military headquarters. As for Chen himself, he was captured by Li Qixiang's troops because he failed to retreat from Qionglai in time. At the same time, Li's troops also captured Shi Zhaowu, the valiant and battle-hardened guard brigade commander of Liu's army. Li Qixiang intended to send Chen Hongwen to the province, while sending a telegram to Liu Xiang for instructions regarding Shi Zhaowu. People everywhere, upon hearing the news, requested that Li have Shi executed by shooting. Shi was known throughout Sichuan as a bandit who liked to prey on women. Not only common women suffered his abuse, but even Li Qixiang's (Sichuan Border Defense Commander) sister and Sun Decao's (Deputy Commander of the 29th Army) niece were harassed and played with by Shi. His usual behavior can be imagined. The reason why Shi dared to act so recklessly was purely because he was brave in battle and valued by Liu Wenhui, and was also Liu's adopted son. Therefore, he had even more to rely on and was fearless. During the fierce battle at Pihe a few days ago, Shi even forcibly married a common woman in Qiong and held a grand wedding feast. After being captured this time, Shi kowtowed incessantly when he was brought before Li Qixiang. Li asked a few questions and imprisoned Shi. Soon, he received a telegram from Liu Xiang ordering his execution. Shi Zhaowu was thus executed in Qionglai. After Chen Hongwen was sent to the province, he was bailed out by Deng Xihou to Liu Xiang and has now regained his freedom, but he has closed his doors to guests and does not ask about anything. As for Peng Chengfu, the commander of the 15th Brigade of Liu Wenhui's army, he was originally the commander of the military police of Deng's army. Last year, in Yongchuan, he changed his allegiance to Liu. Deng's military officers were quite dissatisfied with Peng, and Peng also received a lot of pressure from Liu Wenhui. Therefore, when the war broke out this time, Peng sent representatives to contact Liu Xiang, requesting that he be incorporated into his forces. Liu immediately appointed Peng as the commander of the Provisional Second Division of the Sichuan Army. However, before the order was even issued, Liu Xiang's troops had already crossed the river. Peng's unit was stationed in Chongqing. Liu Xiang sent personnel to reorganize them, and they are currently engaged in training. Liu Wencai, Liu Wenhui's elder brother, had been stationed in southern Sichuan for a long time, serving as the commander of the Southern Sichuan Clearing Campaign and concurrently as the head of the escort. He was also extremely arrogant on weekdays. He extorted millions of dollars in southern Sichuan over several years. The people of all counties in southern Sichuan hated him to the bone. After the Sichuan War last year, Liu Wencai left southern Sichuan and was stationed in Dayi, together with Huang Ao, the independent commander of Liu Wenhui's army, and Mu Suifang, the guard brigade. Mu, nicknamed "Mu Erhuang," originally did not get along with Liu Wencai and occasionally communicated with Liu Yujiu of the former 23rd Army. Liu Wencai then secretly reported to Liu Wenhui, saying that Mu was colluding with Liu Yujiu, plotting rebellion. Liu Wenhui had no reaction. Before long, Liu Wenhui's army retreated west of the Minjiang River. Liu Wencai took the opportunity to send someone to shoot Mu, not allowing his body to be claimed. Mu had considerable influence in the Gelaohui in southern Sichuan. The Jiangliu brothers were determined to avenge Mu. Just as Liu Xiang's army crossed the river, Liu Wencai fled in panic. They took the opportunity to assassinate Liu, who was seriously wounded and died. Liu Wenhui was very saddened when he heard the news. Liu Wenhui has now completely collapsed. It is found that Liu's army originally had more than 100,000 troops. Since the war last year, the strength has been reduced by more than 20,000. This war, after Liu Xiang and others incorporated, disarmed, and scattered troops, has reached another 50,000. Therefore, Liu Wenhui currently has only more than 30,000 people left. It is heard that he has sent personnel to Liu Xiang to express his surrender, asking him not to press further, allowing him to retreat into western Kangding, and the conditions are being negotiated. Therefore, each route has been quietly waiting for the two Lius to discuss, and has not moved, so the front-line war has become silent. (August 27)</p>

Fields and houses were submerged, traffic was blocked, and the water level was still rising, posing an imminent threat. It was proposed to quickly plan for blocking and building to prevent overflow. The 120th meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved: 1) The governments of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces should jointly block the breaches and provide relief; 2) The National Government should instruct the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Huai River Conservancy Commission to work with the respective provincial governments to handle the matter effectively; 3) From the 600,000 yuan previously decided to be allocated to the Yangtze River Flood Control Committee by the Ministry of Finance, the unpaid amount should be transferred first, and a request should be made for an order to handle the matter effectively. The instruction was to comply with the instructions and handle the matter effectively with the respective provincial governments. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan issued an order with the same content, and instructed the Commission to convene a Yellow River flood control meeting of the six provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu to coordinate flood control measures for relief. The Huai River Conservancy Commission and the governments of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces were notified to quickly send two or one responsible representatives to attend the meeting.

<h3>Yellow River Water Situation in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Water Level in the Middle and Lower Reaches Expected to Fall</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water situation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River has not decreased. Fortunately, the upper reaches are gradually seeing a drop in water, and the water source is not strong. The middle and lower reaches should not rise again, or temporarily maintain the status quo, which is also unknown. According to the River Affairs Bureau's recent telegram from the upper reaches, Li Shengtun fell eight centimeters last night, and another nine centimeters this morning, for a total of one inch and seven points, and the situation is temporarily stable.</p>
<p>In the middle reaches, the situation is still critical and worrying. The area near Luokou is relatively strong because it is a stone dam, and Chairman Han has sent troops to assist in the rush to protect it, so it is temporarily stable. The Ji Zhuang, east of the Gaijia Ditch, has already overflowed the dam, and the nearby Wang Er Zhuang has been the first to suffer water damage. The north bank, the Suo Zhuang, west of Qihe, had a leak in the back of the river today, and the river water leaked out tricklingly. Fortunately, it was discovered early and blocked immediately. Also, the dam head of the Wu Zhuang, east of Qihe on the north bank, has collapsed and is currently being rushed to protect it. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, is concerned that the civil embankments in the middle reaches are extremely worrying due to the continuous sharp rise in the river water for days. Today, he went to Luokou to inspect and patrol the dikes near Luokou to direct the soldiers to rush to protect them, hoping to ensure that there is no danger.</p>
<p>In the downstream reaches, the situation in Li Jia in Huimin County on the north bank is tight. Wu Hongji, the magistrate of Huimin County, and Li Fuchang, the section chief, sent telegrams for help, stating briefly: "This morning, the head of the thirteenth dam of Li Jia was scoured and eroded, and the land was invaded seven feet into the water. It was found that the top of the dam was flushed with a large scour, and if there is a leak, it will be related to the safety of the dams below. We are rushing to protect it. The lower corners of the tenth and sixteenth dams are also eroded. We immediately added 400 civilian laborers and are urgently rushing to protect them, hoping to ensure that there is no danger. However, the existing sacks are feared to be insufficient. We earnestly request the director to quickly send 5,000 sacks and send personnel to work to meet the urgent needs." The River Bureau replied with a telegram, stating briefly that it had sent Inspector Li Zongyao to escort 5,000 sacks for transportation and use, and that it must be strictly guarded to avoid omissions. If straw materials are needed, a certain amount of civil materials will also be approved to meet the project needs. Wang Hongji and others then sent a telegram to report that today they supervised the civilian laborers to rush to protect the sixteenth dam of Li Jia with Liu Lou protection, loading 600 sacks, which have now come out of the water, and rush to throw stone materials along the collapsed area of the new thirteenth protection to resist the collapse of the embankment. The thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and other dams were successively suspended and submerged due to the excessive scouring force. It was found that the dam is extremely important, and there is a fear of losing one over another, so we dare not relax in the slightest. We immediately supervised the soldiers to use Liu Lou to throw and press 1,000 sacks overnight, but the scouring is still very severe, so we drove piles and tied ropes to ensure safety. The River Bureau immediately replied by telegram, ordering strict prevention. Also, the second dam of Yuwangkou in Qidong on the south bank was again suspended and submerged by seven or eight zhang, and is being rushed to protect with sacks, etc.</p>
<p>In total, the Yellow River has risen since the 19th, rising continuously for seven days, and only saw a flat water level on the 26th. The magnitude of the water is unprecedented. Today, the middle reaches of Luokou fell by three points, with a water level of 31.22 meters, and the lower reaches of Dama Jia had a flat water level, with a water level of 15.53 meters. According to the river workers, the water can fall in three days. This year's rescue cost more than 100,000 sacks, and this item alone will cost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. (August 27)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Everywhere Filling Their Stomachs with Wild Grass</p>
<p>Relief Committee Borrows 30,000 to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The drought in the counties of northern Fujian has become increasingly severe over the past month. According to the representatives from Pingnan County who came to the province to request relief, the county has a total of 80,000 households, and less than 5,000 households are currently living on porridge. Moreover, they are all staying at home quietly, fearing that once they open their doors, the remaining rice will be robbed by the starving people. The remaining 75,000 households are filling their stomachs with wild grass. Among the wild grasses, there is a kind called "bitter sesame," which is slightly soft and can be cooked and eaten. The starving people regard it as a forbidden food, dividing the boundaries of the countryside, and not allowing each other to cross the boundary to collect it, otherwise they will chase each other with weapons, causing fights. There is also a kind called "fern root," which is rich in starch, but it must be dug more than ten feet into the soil, taking a whole day to get a few roots. Because there are many diggers, the barren mountains and wilderness are full of holes. It is heard every day that people are forced to commit suicide due to unbearable hunger, and die from accidentally eating poisonous grass. All the shops in the county have closed down, and people are fleeing to other counties. The magistrate sits and watches, at a loss for what to do. Pingnan is a county near the province, and the disaster situation is so severe. Other more remote places must be even more unbearable. Although the Provincial Government decided to allocate 20,000 yuan for relief a month ago, the Finance Department has not yet allocated it due to lack of funds. The Relief Committee, in order not to delay, first borrowed 30,000 yuan from the Bank of China to handle emergency relief. The methods are divided into four items: First, transport rice from the provincial capital to sell at low prices; second, lend money to each county, ordering them to buy rice themselves; third, give relief money, ordering them to distribute it to the disaster victims; fourth, transport rice to the disaster areas to provide it to the starving people. The above will be handled until the autumn harvest. However, according to reports from most of the low-price sales personnel recently, after the rice and grain are transported, they are often unattended, because the starving people are extremely poor and cannot afford to buy even the cheapest food.

<h3>Chiang's Order for General Mobilization of Troops to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>And Admonishment to the People to Cooperate Forcefully</p>
<p>Vowing to Eradicate Banditry in the Short Term</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Considering the widespread banditry as a grave internal threat, the Central Government has decided to utilize all forces to suppress all bandits in the short term. As a large-scale encirclement is imminent, seven articles have been specifically formulated to earnestly inform the officers and soldiers at the front lines, as well as the local populace, urging all to work together wholeheartedly to eliminate the bandits. The instruction and seven articles are as follows: "Since 1927, the Red Bandits have been plotting rebellion in Hunan and Jiangxi, with Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue successively betraying the nation, colluding with reactionary elements and local ruffians. They have used various deceitful tactics of coercion and enticement to kidnap the people, seize militia weapons, and secretly grow in strength. The two attacks on Changsha in 1930 demonstrated their sudden increase in power. They have been entrenched in eastern Hunan and southern Jiangxi for six years, during which the people have suffered terribly, the local area has been completely devastated, and our army has sacrificed countless lives without success, leaving the soldiers exhausted and the people in deep pain. As foreign invaders become increasingly urgent, coveting our homeland, if this internal threat is not eliminated, the national crisis cannot be resolved. I am anguished day and night. If our revolutionary soldiers and the entire nation do not arouse their conscience, invigorate their will, and instead remain in a state of cowardly complacency, we will see the destruction of our nation and the extermination of our race in the near future. Now, as we gather troops from several provinces for a large-scale encirclement and suppression, I, the Chairman, am determined to first secure the interior before resisting foreign aggression, vowing to eradicate banditry in the shortest possible time, alleviate the people's suffering, and lay the foundation for the nation. I hereby stipulate the following articles to sincerely inform our officers and soldiers at the front lines and the local populace, hoping that you will take these key points to explain and inform, urging all military personnel, government officials, gentry, and civilians to fully mobilize, invigorate their spirits, work together wholeheartedly to eliminate the evil Red Bandits, and fulfill the revolutionary mission, to comfort the souls of the martyrs and our Founding Father in Heaven. I, the Chairman, have high expectations. This order must be followed." (1) The bandit suppression troops should inform their subordinates of the internal disintegration of the Red Bandits at all times to boost their desire to eliminate them. (2) The bandit suppression troops must be resolute in their determination to encourage the courage of the soldiers. (3) The bandit suppression troops must act in coordination and support each other to strengthen the inherent power of our army. (4) The bandit suppression troops must have strict discipline to gain the sympathy of the people. (5) The bandit suppression troops must support the strength of the people, and the people must assist in military operations to achieve cooperation. (6) The bandit suppression troops must treat the people in the bandit-affected areas as family members in order to fulfill their due responsibilities. (7) The bandit suppression troops must understand their own interests in order to achieve the goal of saving the country.</p>

<h3>Provincial Party Department Supervisor Arrives in Songjiang</h3>
<p>As the term of the county's executive and supervisory committee members has expired, re-elections were originally scheduled for September 1st. The county representatives were to be elected in advance by the party members' congresses of each district branch. However, this year, the county representative election was suspended due to disputes between the two competing parties. Both parties sent representatives to the province to present their cases. The provincial executive committee resolved the matter, stating that the election must proceed and not be delayed under any pretext. Xia Dingwen has been appointed as the supervisor and arrived in Songjiang on the 28th, staying at the Zhenxin Hotel. He attended the county executive committee meeting, which decided to appoint Ye Dingchu, Tang Shanyuan, Lian Heting, and Zhang Dehua as supervisors for each district branch, with elections commencing on the 30th.</p>

<h3>Department Order Urges Payment of Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>The amount of land value tax arrears in the county is truly alarming. Since County Magistrate Yan took office, he has ordered Zhu Kaiguan, the head of land taxation, to strictly pursue the matter. After receiving the order, Director Zhu earnestly handled the matter, and after this year's spring cocoon harvest, a total of 310,000 taxes were collected, breaking all previous records. However, the deadline for the first installment of this year's land value tax is imminent, and the provincial order is urgent. Although Director Zhu has repeatedly urged collection, it coincides with the autumn silkworm season, and most people are unable to pay. Therefore, the amount collected is not very encouraging, causing County Magistrate Yan considerable anxiety.</p>

<h3>Written Statement on Board</h3>
<p>Minister Song issued the following written statement to the reporters on board: "By the order of the government, I, Ziwen, bid farewell to my countrymen for a short period of four months. The mission of this trip was to understand the general economic situation, so that our country and the countries of the world, which are all mired in recession, may achieve the good results of coexistence and co-prosperity through self-help and mutual assistance. Wherever I traveled, I was deeply honored by the warm welcome expressed by the governments and people of friendly nations. Both publicly and privately, I cannot help but express my infinite gratitude at the beginning of my return home. Under the guidance of the government and the expectations of the people, this trip, and the results of the talks with the Washington authorities, have strengthened the friendship between China and the United States. The establishment of the cotton and wheat loan is purely for the purpose of supplying our country's construction. On May 21, a joint declaration with President Roosevelt emphasized the adoption of necessary plans for the revival of China and the world's economic life. In early June, I traveled from the United States to Europe to attend the London Economic Conference. The silver agreement between China, India, the United States, and nine other countries was based on the meaning of the aforementioned declaration. On the one hand, in order to meet the needs of construction talent, the Council of the League of Nations was willing to continue to expand technical cooperation. Afterwards, I traveled from England to France to Italy to Germany, where I examined the new trends in their politics and industry, all of which can serve as a good model for our country. Now that the mission I was entrusted with has been completed, I should return home as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, before I could set foot on my country's soil, the first shocking news I heard was the breach of the Yellow River, which has caused the people of the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu in the middle and lower reaches to suffer an unprecedented catastrophe after their rural areas were on the verge of bankruptcy. Who doesn't have a home? Who doesn't have a wife and children? If one were to put oneself in their place, how unbearable would it be to be displaced and torn apart? Even though I was still on the high seas, I could not help but feel deeply saddened. The pain felt by our Chairman, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the presidents of various courts, the authorities in the disaster-stricken provinces, and the officials of the government, as well as the difficulties and hardships of supporting relief efforts, are even more unimaginable. I am both deeply impressed by the rapid progress of the world's economy, culture, and national defense and alarmed by the frequent occurrence of natural and man-made disasters in our country in recent years. I believe that the way to build the nation lies in focusing on the national economy and maintaining and developing it with the full strength of the state. At the same time, I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will eliminate prejudices, gather the resources, materials, and talent of the whole country, and take the spirit of building friendly nations as the only way to save the country. Even if our country is poor, there is still much to be done. If we have the determination to help ourselves, then the world's resources and wealth will be sufficient for our use. This is what I have seen in various countries, and I believe that I can grasp it firmly. I would like to encourage myself with this, and encourage my countrymen together."</p>
<h3>Thanking the Welcome from Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Minister Song also issued a statement on board thanking the welcome from various organizations: "When I was ordered to attend the World Economic Conference as an envoy, friendly nations did not regard me as a representative of a country with three million people in four occupied provinces. I was warmly and sincerely welcomed by all friendly nations. This is not a welcome to Ziwen personally, but an expression of sympathy for our country and a hope that the people of our country, after their suffering, can be vigilant, eliminate personal prejudices, work together for construction, and sincerely and practically cooperate economically with friendly nations to fulfill the position that our nation deserves. Today, as I return home, I am deeply moved by the grand and warm welcome from all walks of life. What achievements do I, Ziwen, have to deserve such preferential treatment? I am deeply aware that today's welcome from all walks of life to Ziwen personally is a welcome to the sincere friendship of friendly nations and the warm hope. May all our compatriots rise up, unite, and plan for construction to seek a bright path for our nation. I respectfully express my gratitude and thank you for your kindness."</p>
<h3>Receiving Reporters and Detailing Thoughts</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, Song received reporters from various newspapers, about thirty people, at his residence in Qiqi Road. After tea and refreshments, they sat in a circle in the garden. Song first exchanged greetings with the reporters and expressed his gratitude. Then, a question and answer session was held. A summary of Song's remarks is as follows: (1) The fear of economic hardship in European and American countries has prompted them to seek various ways, change various means, and abandon previous economic principles and ideals, seeking only to solve the current difficulties. After arriving in the United States, I realized that the economic difficulties in the United States have turned around. Former President Hoover adhered to the old ways and maintained stability everywhere, failing to reform systems such as tariffs and taxes. The president's power was also not as great as that of the current President Roosevelt. Since Roosevelt took office, he has been desperately seeking a way out, believing that the economic difficulties cannot be solved and that the future of the entire country and society is very dangerous. Therefore, when Roosevelt took office, many banks collapsed, and the government bailed them out with money. On the monetary system, he resolutely abandoned the gold standard. However, according to the situation in the United States, there was no need to abandon the gold standard, as its exports still exceeded imports, it was the world's creditor, and it possessed sixty to seventy percent of the world's finance. However, the intention was to raise prices. As a result, today's United States, the prices of cotton, wheat, and stocks have risen significantly. Since President Roosevelt took office, he has gained the faith of the majority of the people. In addition to the United States, I have traveled to England, France, Italy, and Germany to observe the methods adopted by each country. Although they are different, the purpose of solving the current economic difficulties is the same. As for the World Economic Conference held in London, except for the silver agreement, there were no concrete results on other issues such as the monetary system and tariffs. The effect was not great. It may continue to be convened in the future, but looking ahead, there are still many difficulties.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Wheat Loan Allocation of Use</h3>
<p>(2) The cotton and wheat loan established in the United States is indeed guaranteed by the consolidated tax. The cotton portion has already begun to be shipped to China, and more will arrive successively. The wheat portion has not yet begun to be purchased and shipped because the price has not been agreed upon. However, the principle of using cotton and wheat is to raise the loan for the sake of construction, and it will naturally be supplied to Chinese merchants and manufacturers. There has been no news of resale to foreign manufacturers. The issue of how to use and allocate the cotton and wheat is completely under our country's own control and has never been discussed with the American authorities. The allocation of cotton will be studied in the long term with the government authorities and then decided. As for the overestimation of the impact of the shipment of American cotton and wheat to China on our agricultural products, it can be compared with the situation of import trade deficits in the customs over the years, and the cotton and wheat will also arrive successively, so there will be no significant impact. The allocation of the cotton and wheat loan has not yet been discussed and will be decided after consultation with government officials. As for the rumors arising from the cotton and wheat loan, such as borrowing money from Britain to buy military fire, etc., they are completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Fascist Unity</h3>
<p>Regarding observations on the politics of European countries, Italy and Germany both have Fascist systems. Although the methods are different, the spirit is national unity. Everything is not controlled by individuals, but by the state. Workers do not strike, and capitalists do not reduce wages, taking the interests of society and the state as their own interests, and jointly seeking the stability of the country. For example, the recent revival plan implemented in the United States, its purpose is actually the same. Finally, when Mr. Song answered reporters' questions about the Southwest using opposition to the central government as an excuse to send telegrams to various countries' authorities, Mr. Song said that this move does have some impact on our national system, but we should also do our best to explain and eliminate misunderstandings from all parties. Because in this critical period in our country, the only way out is to rely on unity, and the so-called unity should not be empty talk. Everyone must be able to embrace the spirit of sacrifice in order to achieve the hope of true unity.</p>

<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Prince Carl of Sweden, who came to the East this time for travel, arrived in Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada on the 27th, arriving at 6:30 last night.

And many armed policemen specially dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau took another Public Security small wheel to follow and protect him. Prince Carl met Mayor Wu and the welcoming personnel in the ship's cabin and expressed his gratitude. He then got off the ship and transferred to the Jinghui small wheel, which sailed directly to the new customs pier. He landed at 7:15 and went to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Banquet</h3>
<p>Prince Carl is only twenty-one years old and is the nephew of the current Swedish King. He was wearing a gray suit yesterday, young, handsome, and full of energy.

<h3>Capitalists Claim to Employ New Workers, British and American Labor Unrest Deteriorates</h3>
<p>If Capitalists Do Not Express Satisfaction, Prepare to Strike</p>
<p>Seamen and Other Unions Send Condolences and Support</p>
<p>Mediation of School Disputes Yields No Results Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor dispute between the British and American tobacco factories has been pending for a long time, resulting in a strike at the new and old factories. The union held a reception for the press yesterday to report on the process. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated the school incident yesterday, but still no results were achieved. The union submitted a petition to the Party and government organs requesting a replacement of the factory representative who was not responsible, and scheduled the third representative meeting for next Thursday to decide on a joint general strike to deal with the matter. The seamen's and other unions pledged to be the backing force. All departments are still shut down, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Backing Force</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union sent a letter to the Fifth District Cigarette Association yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, upon receiving your letter, it is roughly stated that the factory has arbitrarily formulated factory regulations, deprived workers of their interests, modified labor-capital conditions, disobeyed mediation and illegally recorded demerits, dismissed workers, violated government orders, refused workers to resume work, and alienated unity. Upon approval of this, it is found that the factory's actions are absurd and outrageous. In addition to sending cadre Leng Renyi to express condolences, we are willing to lead 800,000 seamen to be the backing force. This is hereby notified for your reference, Standing Committee Member Yang Hu Zhang Chuangbai, Lin Yinsheng."</p>
<h3>Condolences from All Circles</h3>
<p>The British and American Tobacco Factory Union, because the factory repeatedly violated labor-capital conditions, laid off workers, violated government orders, refused workers to resume work, and changed to a joint strike of more than 8,000 workers from the new and old factories on the 25th of this month to promote the factory's final awareness. Unexpectedly, the factory turned a deaf ear, resulting in a five-day strike, and opinions were not close. Because the workers in various departments have no results, they are still striking and protesting. The Fifth District Party Headquarters and workers strictly abide by order and specially sent representatives Shen Fengmei, Chinese Seamen's Union sent Leng Renqing, Fifth District Cotton Weaving Union sent Ge Yunting and others to express condolences yesterday. After the unions in Pudong issued a declaration of support on the 27th, the unions have now scheduled a meeting in the Pudong Wood and Water Industry Union at the beginning of next month to discuss and jointly send a telegram of support.</p>
<h3>Petition for Record</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Union held a representative meeting the night before last and resolved to organize a strike committee. It then submitted a petition to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for record yesterday. The original petition said, "For the matter of petitioning for record, your humble association convened an emergency representative meeting on the 28th of this month, and Comrade Lu Yinchu, a member of your association bureau, came to the venue to guide it. At the venue, it was resolved that if the factory still does not realize after a long strike, it will decide to organize a strike committee and exercise its powers when necessary. Nineteen members were appointed on the spot, and all twenty directors and supervisors of the union were ex officio members. All meeting circumstances should be reported to your association bureau for verification and record. Sincerely presented."</p>
<h3>Mediation Fails</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the British and American factory depriving labor of educational rights, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation again yesterday. Lu Yinchu from the City Party Headquarters, Tang Jingxiu from the Education Bureau, Li Deke and Chen Cangzai from the capitalist side, and Chen Peide and Liu Dehua from the labor side attended, and Jing Guan and Zhang Ziping were present. The meeting was chaired by Tu Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau. The Municipal Government also stipulated a solution. The school board system was changed to a five-five-five system, with five people appointed by the union, the factory, and the Education Bureau respectively. Regarding the six measures, the union expressed its acceptance of the principle of reorganizing the school board, but the capitalist school board must have shareholder qualifications, the funds must be received by the union, the school board must also be hired by the union, and it was stated that the school has already started classes, and the capitalist side has not allowed the opening of the playground gate and should be stopped. Regarding the measures stipulated by the Municipal Government, a deadline must be given for discussion. The chairman asked for the capitalist side's opinion and decided to reschedule the mediation.</p>
<h3>Reception of the Press</h3>
<p>At the same time, the union, fearing that all circles would not understand the truth, specially held a reception for the press at the Qingnianhui in Baxianfang at 3:30 yesterday afternoon. More than 50 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers attended. During the meeting, Chairman Chen Peide reported on the process, and then asked for written assistance. It is heard that the union intends to host a banquet for all circles and ask for the same help.</p>
<h3>Please Remove the Representative</h3>
<p>The union believes that Li Deke, the Western personnel stock director of the capitalist side who attends the mediation each time, has many criticisms of the mediation of the Party and government organs, and sometimes even declares that he cannot be responsible, resulting in a backlog of labor-capital cases that cannot be resolved. Yesterday, a special petition was submitted to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a replacement, and the capitalist side was ordered to appoint a fully responsible representative to avoid delays and serious disputes. (The original petition is very long and omitted.)</p>
<h3>Prepare for a Strike</h3>
<p>After the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union's Leaf Department went on strike, it held its first emergency representative meeting on the 18th of this month to discuss countermeasures, and decided that workers from the new and old factories would jointly go on strike to promote the factory's awareness. Because the capitalist side ignored it, it implemented the strike on the 25th. Because the factory still ignored it, it held a second representative meeting the day before yesterday and decided to organize a strike committee, which has been submitted to the Party and government for record. Now the union will give another week of grace. If the factory still ignores it, it has decided to hold a third representative meeting at the Pudong Clubhouse at 5:30 pm on September 4th, when it will implement a strike in order to have a final solution.</p>
<h3>Both Sides Insist</h3>
<p>According to news from the British and American capitalist side, if the workers still do not resume work today, they will hire new workers and use a large number of detectives to protect the work. The attitude is very firm and may be implemented. According to Chen Peide, a standing committee member of the union, who told the New Sound Agency reporter, the workers' attitude towards this matter is very firm, and they will not give up until they get results. The union hopes that the authorities will find a way to remedy the situation to avoid the unfortunate strike. At the same time, it is determined to proceed with the steps of the representative meeting resolution according to the workers' will and actively handle it. It is heard that Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, is now mediating in his private capacity, but it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Anti-War Congress Held in Shanghai, Japan Strongly Opposes It</h3>
<p>The Authorities of the Two Concessions Therefore</p>
<p>May Also Refuse to Hold the Meeting</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday afternoon, Sir Ma Lai, the British representative and chairman of the Far East Congress of the World Anti-War League, visited Mr. Tai Weisen, the British Acting Consul General in Shanghai, and learned that Japan is now strongly opposed to the holding of the Anti-War Congress in Shanghai. Therefore, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession may therefore refuse to hold the meeting within the Concessions. According to Tai Weisen, Japan has expressed its willingness to the two Concession authorities not to allow the Anti-War Congress to be held within the Concessions. The Concession authorities had disputes with Japan during the Songhu War, so they did not want to cause friction again because of the Anti-War Congress. It is heard that Sir Ma Lai plans to go to Beijing to visit government officials to inquire about their intentions.</p>
<h3>Father Li Invents a New Pendulum for Measuring the Earth's Gravity</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that Father Li, the director of the Xujiahui Observatory, invented a new pendulum in Paris two years ago that can measure the earth's gravity in an instant, which is more accurate than the old method that takes most of the day to measure. If this device is used to map a detailed map of China by plane, then what could not be completed in the past hundred years can be easily completed in a few years. A few days ago, Father Li went to Guling to visit Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission, and explained in detail the convenience of using this device to map maps from the sky. Father Li returned to Shanghai at the end of last week, and this summer, in order to test the practical value of the new pendulum, he and Luo Ruiyu (transliteration), a representative of the Peiping Research Institute, used this pendulum in Hubei and Shaanxi provinces to map 500,000 square kilometers from the sky, accounting for about one-twentieth of China's total area, which was completed in only two months. If calculated according to the old method, the earth's gravity would take at least five years. At that time, the earth's gravity was measured every 100 kilometers, so the median of the earth's gravity between the two measurement points was very similar to the earth's gravity of the entire region. The results of the measurement in the two provinces showed that the earth's gravity gradually decreased as it moved westward to the mountains. In the area where the coastline is parallel to the north-south direction, the earth's gravity is often equal.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Returned to Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou went to the Nanyang area for travel and investigation, and his business has been completed. He took the Empress of Canada of the Changxing Company and returned to Shanghai at 6:30 pm yesterday. He transferred to a small wheel at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong and landed at the New Customs Wharf at 7:50 pm and returned to his residence.</p>
<h3>The Shutdown Process of the Telecommunications Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machinery Factory in Pudong, Shanghai, was ordered to shut down, the Ministry immediately sent two commissioners to Shanghai to take over. The factory is now rushing to complete the winding-up matters and preparing to hand over at the end of the month. However, the workers still hope to resume work and request Director Yu to postpone the handover. It is heard that the issue of the factory shutdown has been brewing for a long time. Since the Ministry went last year, it has repeatedly sent commissioners to the factory to inspect and ordered the factory to strengthen its rectification. However, the results of the inspection all stated that the content of the factory was seriously inadequate. Therefore, the Ministry finally decided to order the factory to temporarily shut down for rectification and plans to expand it in the future to increase production for future needs. As for the factory technicians, it has been clearly ordered to give them severance pay and dismissal, but it is still intended to treat them favorably to show compassion.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Experts Praise the Customs' Perfect Administration</h3>
<p>When the reporter met with a senior official of the Customs yesterday and talked about the recent case of bribery by the Customs porters of the Jianghai Customs, the official expressed great hatred, but said that this was done by a part of the tea servants and had nothing to do with the Customs officials. Outsiders do not know the truth and spread rumors, resulting in suspicion about the improper handling of the Customs. In fact, since the opening of the Customs, it has been more than 80 years, and the system and achievements, although not perfect, have been remarkable. As for the methods of cheating, which are emerging one after another, the strictness of the Customs system will enable them to be discovered at any time. This is still something that can be reported to the country and society without shame. Furthermore, since China actively cooperated with the League of Nations, the financial experts hired by the Chinese government, Shen Muwei and Ma Teng, have also come to China to engage in investigation and planning. It has been several months now. In addition to inquiring about everything from the General Affairs Department, they have also conducted on-the-spot investigations of the Customs in various ports across the country. The two of them unanimously praised the administrative system of the Customs. In addition to praising the Customs administration, Mr. Ma also said that the integrity of this system should be preserved, and other government financial institutions should also follow suit. It is found that Shen Muwei was the former Deputy Labor Minister of the British Labor Cabinet, and Ma Teng was the financial expert of the League of Nations. The remarks of the two should not be false.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Zongli, a French Doctor of Science, Returns to China</h3>
<p>Zhang Zongli, from Suqian, Jiangsu, with a Bachelor of Science degree from Southeast University, went to France to enter the University of Paris in the 19th year, obtained a Master of Science degree and a optical engineer from the French National Optical Institute. In the 19th year, he studied the astigmatism of glass and the astigmatism on the surface of Canadian tree rubber in the Optical Institute. In view of the lack of optical instrument makers in the country, he did not hesitate to work hard. All the instruments used for the experiment were manufactured by hand. He passed his dissertation in July of this year and obtained the French National Doctor of Science degree with the highest honor. The examiner professor will publish the dissertation in the French Optical Journal. In France, he carefully studied Suqian glass sand for the purpose of developing industry after returning to China. Peking University telegraphed to hire him as a professor, and the Sino-French University sent a telegram to hire him again, and replied with a telegram of refusal, but hired him as a lecturer. He is now taking the French postal ship Félix Rousset from Marseille on July 28 and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around September 1.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Announces Correction of Navigation Wheel Stop Signal</h3>
<p>Flag Language Has Also Been Corrected</p>
<p>Scheduled to Take Effect on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>Bolader, the Tax Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, issued Announcement No. 314 yesterday, saying, "For the matter of the announcement, the Customs conducts searches on the sea surface and notifies sailing ships of the signals to be used for stopping the wheel in accordance with the regulations. Now, it is specially revised according to the International General Signal of the Republic of China in the 20th year as follows: First, use the steam whistle signal, which emits a short sound of the steam whistle once, a long sound once, and two short sounds again, so that sailing ships know what to expect, and then use the flag signal, use the International General Flag No. of the Republic of China in the 20th year. In case of urgent accidents, double flag flags can also be used. This signal must be decided according to the needs of the time. Suspend the flag as follows: ON should stop, stop immediately, WS should stop the wheel immediately, DG should drop anchor immediately. After it complies with the order to stop the wheel, then show the flag as follows: RU where to go, RW where to come from, and what should be noted is that the steam whistle signal used in the past, a short sound once, a long sound once, and two short sounds again, means to stop the wheel, with the intention of conveying important matters. This time, the new signal is still retained without changing it. Again, in this new signal, the Very light has already been used as a distress signal, and its previous use as a night-time stop for civilian ships should be abolished. The above methods are decided to be implemented from January 1, 23rd year of the Republic of China. All shipping merchants should be fully aware of this, and this is hereby announced.</p>

<p>Another Brutal Case of a Box Corpse</p>
<h3>Corpse Dismembered into Eight Sections</h3>
<p>Head and Body Hidden in Wooden Box</p>
<p>Both Hands and Feet Are in the Package</p>
<p>Patient in Guangdong People's Hospital Witnessed the Process</p>
<p>At about 4:00 yesterday morning, an assassination case was discovered at the intersection of Diswei Road and Baoan Road in Hongkou. The victim was a man who was dismembered by the murderer after the incident and packed into a wooden box and cloth bag, and hired a car to discard them there. The investigation results are described below.</p>
<h3>Check Post Sees Wooden Box and Cloth Bag</h3>
<p>No. 1114, Diswei Road, leads to Diswei Road in the front and Changchun Road in the back. This is a road built across the border. Therefore, the post police of the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District are only at the Changchun Road intersection. Usually, the Diswei Road Police also sends police to patrol there from time to time. Near the lane, there is a Guangdong People's Hospital, and many people are hospitalized with illnesses. At about 3:00 yesterday morning, Li Xueshan, the patrol chief of the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District, went out to check the difference as usual, from the first post to the eighteenth post, and crossed No. 1114 and detoured to Diswei Road, and planned to go to Xingjiazha Road to check the twentieth post. When Li stepped out of the lane and approached the Guangdong People's Hospital, he saw that the road was being built there, and there were two piles of soil on the sidewalk. Li was planning to detour and used a flashlight to probe. He suddenly saw a red lacquered wooden box and a white-bottomed blue flower cloth bag placed in the middle of the two piles of soil. Li was very surprised at the time. After waiting for a while, he did not see any movement, so he still went to each post to check the difference, and returned to the station at 6:00 to report the above information to Director Liang and went to investigate.</p>
<h3>Body Cut Into Pieces, Blood Stains Gruesome</h3>
<p>After Police Chief Li passed by, the plainclothes patrol police No. 3320 of the Diswei Road Police also patrolled the area at about 4:00 and also continued to discover the above-mentioned wooden box cloth bag. At that time, the police suspected that it was stolen goods left by a thief and thought that they would definitely come to pick them up. Therefore, they also hid near the entrance of the Guangdong People's Hospital for a while, but did not see any movement. The police then went forward to inspect it and saw a wooden box, painted with inferior red paint and tied with ropes in a cross shape, and a cloth bag, which was a white-bottomed blue flower cloth bag, wrapped with a broken straw mat on the outside. The police was greatly suspicious and was about to open it to see when a rickshaw puller passed by. The police immediately called him to help, first removing the straw mat from the outside of the cloth bag, then untied the cloth bag and looked at it carefully. He was shocked to see two legs, two feet, and two hands that had been sawn off, with blood stains and a foul smell. Upon seeing this, the police was terrified and rushed to the police station to report it. Hua Detective Shang Wu, Detective Xu Zhiqing, and Detective Chen Dabao and others rushed to investigate and continued to open the wooden box and saw that the inside was lined with oil paper, with a broken blue cloth white collar jacket placed on top, and a piece of canvas below. When he looked at it again, he saw a male head and a section of the middle of the body, with blood stains all over the box. He then learned that it was definitely an assassination and immediately took the wooden box cloth bag to the police station. When the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District went to investigate, they had already been taken away by the police station.</p>
<h3>Dismembered Into Eight Sections Without Damaging Bones</h3>
<p>After taking the items to the police station and re-examining them, it was discovered that the deceased had been dismembered into eight sections. The most surprising thing was that the parts where the body was divided were all at the bone junctions. Although the tendons were cut off, the bones were undamaged. It seemed to be done by someone who deeply understood human anatomy. The deceased had five wounds on the head, including the back of the head, the left cheek, the top of the head, the back of the neck, and the forehead. The knife on the back of the head was the deepest. In the middle section of the body, there was a knife on the left breast and a knife in front of the heart. Blood was still gushing out. For the convenience of investigation, the police station immediately spread the body flat on the ground and arranged it according to the body parts, and it was clearly a whole male body, about 30 years old, with a round haircut. He was very strong in life. It was also observed that the neck was cut with a small knife, and then many photos were taken for record and sent to the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District, etc., asking for assistance. They immediately went to the scene of the incident with Director Liang of the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District to investigate. As a result, hundreds of people from far and near rushed to watch. Many patients in the Guangdong People's Hospital also watched from the windows. Soon it spread throughout the entire hospital. At the same time, the police station and the police station also entered the hospital to ask questions, hoping to find clues.</p>
<h3>Li Jiansan Describes What He Saw</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Li Jiansan, a patient in a certain ward on the second floor of the hospital at that time, suddenly claimed to have witnessed the entire process of moving the corpse in the case. He also said that his ward happened to face the entrance of Alley 1114. At about 2 AM yesterday morning, Li, unable to sleep due to the extremely hot weather, got up and</p>
<p>pushed open the window to enjoy the cool air and look around, breathing in the fresh air. Suddenly, he saw a rickshaw coming from the north. A man in a black long gown was sitting on the rickshaw, with a wooden box and a cloth package placed in front of him. Behind the rickshaw followed a man in a blue cloth short shirt and pants, walking slowly. At first glance, it seemed like the man in the rickshaw was sick and was being escorted to the hospital for treatment. When the rickshaw reached near the entrance of the hospital, it stopped. The man in blue cloth shirt and pants helped the man in black to carry down the wooden box and cloth package. Then, the man in black paid the rickshaw puller two jiao for the fare, and after the rickshaw puller left, the two men never entered the hospital. Instead, they placed the wooden box and cloth package between two piles of earth and then peered around in all directions before leaving in a fluster. He had no idea that such a tragic case had occurred.</p>
<h3>Police Detectives Exert Themselves in Investigation</h3>
<p>After the police station and precinct learned of the above situation, they reported it to their respective superiors and studied the case. When reporters revisited various parties for inquiries at 12 o'clock last night, it was said that there were still no clues. However, based on Mr. Li's report and considering the way the body was dismembered, along with the shape of the wooden box and cloth package, three points could be distinguished: 1. Judging from the appearance and limbs of the deceased, he was definitely not a high-class person. 2. The murderer must have had a deep understanding of human anatomy or was even engaged in slaughtering. 3. The wooden box and cloth package were similar to the belongings of poor people. Considering what Mr. Li witnessed at the time, it is even more proof that the deceased was indeed killed by someone from the lower or middle class. Therefore, all police stations in the city and the police stations in the British and French concessions are now investigating the whereabouts of the rickshaw puller who was hired at the time, tracing the location where the wooden box and other items were loaded onto the rickshaw, and are also conducting careful investigations in other industries, hoping that the truth will soon come to light. The body has been sent to the autopsy center on Rue Frelon by the police car, and the court has been requested to conduct an examination this morning.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Huge Robbery Case Involving Over 120,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Part of the Interrogation of Li Jinxiang and Zhou Xuechun Concluded</p>
<p>Li Longsheng Sentenced to One Year for Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Wang A'nan and Others Appeal Against the Original Verdict</p>
<p>In the huge robbery case involving 129,080 yuan, Li Jinxiang, the wife of the notorious thief Li A'long, also known as "Scarface A'long," had previously given 5,000 yuan of the stolen money given to her by her husband A'long to her lover Zhou Xuechun. They rented a house on Route Hennequin in the French Concession and lived together. Later, Zhou stole 4,000 yuan of the remaining money and fled. Jinxiang negotiated with Zhou's sister, Ai, forcing her to hand over Xuechun. The two sides quarreled, and the police were informed and arrested them into the Public Security Bureau. After the French police sent detectives to extradite Li Jinxiang to the Second Special Court for trial, Attorney Zhou surrendered himself to the court, denying theft and attempting to evade responsibility. He was ordered to be detained together and handed over to the police for investigation and further interrogation. Later, after investigation by the police, Zhou knew it was difficult to deny and admitted to stealing the stolen money. Subsequently, the police discovered 975 yuan of the stolen money under the stairs of the Zhou Yuanchang redwood shop opened by his father, escorted him to the court for interrogation and detention, and waited to be tried together with Li Jinxiang, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police attorney Yuan Jiahuang presented the case, prosecuting Li for receiving stolen goods under Article 376 of the Criminal Law, and Zhou for theft and embezzlement under Articles 337 and 356 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Li Jinxiang and Zhou Xuechun confessed to receiving stolen money and theft. Finally, after arguments between the police attorney and the defendants' attorneys, the judge asked Li and Zhou if they had anything to say. Li Jinxiang said, "Zhou Xuechun is my lover and also the person I love the most. I don't know why he had such a dark heart, which resulted in me being involved in a lawsuit." Zhou lowered his head and said nothing. The court verified the confessions, announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the judgment for September 5. The defendants were still detained separately. In addition, the notorious thief Li A'long took out 10,000 yuan of the stolen money, giving 5,000 yuan to his wife Li Jinxiang and another 4,000 yuan to his brother Li Longsheng for safekeeping. Longsheng received the money and deposited 2,000 yuan with his sister-in-law Zhu Li's family, and used 1,800 yuan to hire a lawyer to handle A'long's appeal. The French police arrested Li Jinxiang and Zhou Xuechun and escorted them to the court for trial. The concealment of stolen money by Li Longsheng was also discovered by Inspector General Jin Jiulin and Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, who rushed to No. 12 Chaomibang, Zhabei, and arrested Longsheng. They also seized 2,000 yuan of stolen money and a lawyer's receipt from Zhu Li's home at No. 278 Min'anfang, Route Foch, and brought them back to the police station for further investigation, as previously reported. The police have now escorted Longsheng to the Second Special Court and filed a public prosecution against him for receiving stolen goods. After the interrogation was concluded, Li Longsheng was sentenced to one year in prison for receiving stolen goods yesterday, and the stolen money was ordered to be returned to the rightful owner.</p>
<p>According to another report, the huge robbery case involving over 120,000 yuan on Rue de Verdun in the French Concession, which caused a sensation for a time, was due to the swift handling of the case by the French Concession Police Department. Starting the day after the incident, they successively arrested three accomplices, Wang Mao'nan, Zhang Weicai, and Li A'long (i.e., Scarface A'long), and handed them over to the Second Special District Court for separate sentences (Zhang was sentenced to ten years and six months, while Wang and Li were each sentenced to nine years). More than 50,000 yuan of the stolen money was also recovered. Since the occurrence of this case, the efficiency of the French Concession Police Department has been praised by public opinion. However, Li and the other two were not satisfied with their sentences and hired attorneys Ma Shouhua and Wu Zhengzhao to file an appeal with the High Third Branch Court on their behalf. It is heard that the case will be publicly heard in the Third Court of the High Court at 3:00 PM on September 1. Because Wang and others went to the Great Shanghai Hotel to divide the stolen money after committing the crime, the court did not avoid seeking details and will summon the hotel's accounting staff and tea servers to court at that time for detailed interrogation.</p>
<h3>Two Suspects Arrested in the Assassination of Gao A'gen</h3>
<p>Tong Tianhua and Li Jinshan are Both Well-Known Thugs</p>
<p>Detectives Surround and Arrest Them at the Datong Hotel</p>
<p>Gao A'gen (also known as Gao Lansheng), the "King of Lotteries," nicknamed "Pockmarked A'gen," also engaged in the business of manufacturing red pills and trafficking opium. He had been assassinated several times but escaped unharmed. Recently, before Gao was arrested by the French police, someone was plotting to assassinate Gao in Room 418 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. However, the plot was leaked, and Xu Changrong was arrested by Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Zhou Guisen of the Old Zha Police Station and escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Gao was then arrested by the French police. For the convenience of investigation, the French police requested the Second Special District Court to transfer Xu Changrong to the First Special Court. The other day, Chief Detective Xie Shuiquan of the Old Zha Police Station also learned that Tong Tianhua (nicknamed "Cripple A'san"), a well-known thug from Ningbo, and Li Jinshan (also known as Wang Jinshan), from Nanjing, were also heavily suspected of being involved in the Gao assassination plot and that Tong and others had Room 231 at the Datong Hotel. He then ordered several detectives to wait at the entrance of the hotel. It was not until 1:30 AM the other day that Tong and Li were arrested and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's First Criminal Court. Police attorney Ru Baoyi stated that the police station was conducting a thorough investigation of the case and requested permission to postpone the hearing to facilitate the investigation. Chief Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Hearing of the Box Corpse Case Concluded, Two Murderers to be Sent to Macau for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Conclusive and Unshakeable Evidence Obtained</p>
<p>How Will They be Punished in Macau? Let's See the Results</p>
<p>After the murderer, Baderlie, confessed to the crime in the box corpse case, the last witness was summoned yesterday, and the case has come to an end. They will soon be sent to Macau to be formally tried and sentenced by the court. The situation after yesterday's court hearing is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Three Witnesses Summoned</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was the date for the last hearing of the box corpse case by the Portuguese Consulate. The consulate summoned three people, including Lin Jiuzhu, a Japanese resident of No. 14 Jiaxing Road, and Ma Xiaowei, a shop assistant from the Yang Jinrong box shop on Broadway, to inquire whether the two defendants went to purchase the box together. The Japanese witness was also asked whether the accomplice Qiu Shifu took a carriage to the Wusong Wharf to move the body after the case occurred. The witnesses stated the facts, and the clerk recorded them into the case before they were dismissed from the court. This was the end of the final trial.</p>
<h3>Accomplice Confirmed</h3>
<p>The accomplice, Qiu Shifu, tried his best to deny participating in the conspiracy and moving the body. However, his actions of transporting the box were confirmed by the witnesses yesterday, so the crime was established and could not be denied. Therefore, Dr. Xue Erfu, the Portuguese Consul General, has compiled all the confessions of the witnesses and the principal offenders from the five hearings and prepared to send them to the Macau court for formal trial to determine the sentence. The Portuguese Consul will proceed with the extradition as soon as the procedures are completed.</p>
<h3>Extradition of Murderers to Macau</h3>
<p>The defendant confessed to committing the murder, and the other defendant proved to be an accomplice. Now that the witnesses and physical evidence are complete, Portuguese Consul Xue Erfu decided to send the two criminals to Macau for sentencing. Due to procedural reasons, they will have to wait two weeks before they can depart. At that time, the consul will send a special commissioner to carry all the case files and physical evidence, and request two people who originally handled the case, the Western detectives Williams and others from the police station, to escort the two criminals to Macau. According to Portuguese law, the death penalty has been abolished, but those who commit murder must be sent to East Africa to serve hard labor for 20 to 25 years.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xinglin, who Embezzled Huge Sums Four Years Ago, Arrested</h3>
<p>Using Public Funds for Speculative Ventures</p>
<p>Fleeing with a Huge Amount of Accounts</p>
<p>Arrested After Being Wanted for a Long Time</p>
<p>Chen Yuting, a 58-year-old from Suzhou residing at No. 12, Lane 56, Route Mett Hermès, and Liu Yunfeng, a 61-year-old residing at No. 17, Minguo Lane, Minguo Road, previously partnered with Zhu Xinglin from Zhenjiang, a Mr. Wang, and the late Wang Xianhua and Zhang Zhangfu, etc., in 1927 to open the Shen Taichang Foreign Goods Store at No. 92 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession, with a total capital of 40,000 taels, each share being 4,000 taels. Chen and others each held two shares, and Zhu held half a share, totaling 2,000 taels, attached to the Wang share. Zhu Xinglin was appointed as the manager. However, Zhu successively embezzled public funds from the store for private speculative ventures, amounting to over 100,000 taels. By the end of 1928, the capital had been moved and could not be circulated properly, so the store could not be maintained. Unexpectedly, on the third day of the first lunar month of the following year (1929), Zhu fled with 50,000 to 60,000 yuan of accounts received at the end of the previous year, leaving no trace. The store then closed immediately. The shareholders dispatched people to check the accounts and found that Zhu had embezzled a total of 160,000 yuan. They still insisted on summoning people to take over the business of the store and filed a lawsuit with the former French Municipal Council, and on March 4, 1929, they hired attorneys Yan Di Beck and Yao Zhaodi to represent Shen Taichang Store and published a reward of 1,000 yuan to arrest Zhu Xinglin, but the case was never solved. Until noon on the 28th of this month, Zhu was passing in front of the Materials Exchange at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, when he was encountered by Chen Shuchu, the son of shareholder Chen Yuting, who seized Zhu, cried for help and arrested him into the police station. After questioning, it was found that the crime location was in the French Concession, so the police dispatched Detective Wu Wengang and Xu Youyi, etc., to investigate. Zhu was temporarily detained while it was found that Zhu had committed embezzlement in 1913, during the second year of the Republic of China, and the case had been investigated by the French Municipal Council. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated him. According to police attorney Fei Xizhen, the police station has not concluded the investigation of the case and requested that the defendant be temporarily detained and the investigation be completed within one week before being formally prosecuted. Then, the plaintiff Chen Shuchu stated the circumstances of the defendant's embezzlement of public funds and presented the share certificates and wanted newspapers to the court. When questioned, Zhu Xinglin confessed that he was 46 years old and currently resided at No. 1, Milfort Lane, Gloch Road, and also had half a share in Shen Taichang Foreign Goods Store. Although he was the manager, the shareholders sent people to supervise the store. In fact, it was because the accounts receivable at that time could not be collected, which led to the stagnation of turnover. The amount of money that the businessman had moved around totaled about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, which could be checked in the accounts. At that time, the merchant reported to the shareholders and once tried to mediate but failed, so the shareholders filed a lawsuit and issued a warrant, etc., and hired attorney Lan Xuzhang to defend him, requesting that the defendant be allowed to post bail and await interrogation during the postponement period. The court verified the confessions and announced that the hearing would be postponed to September 2 for further interrogation. The defendant was allowed to provide a shop guarantee with a deposit of 20,000 yuan. If this deposit is ordered by the court, it should be paid immediately, otherwise he will be detained without bail.</p>
<h3>Auspicious Day for Newly Weds, Groom Attacked En Route</h3>
<p>Zhu Kouzi Severely Wounded by Axe</p>
<p>One Assailant and Two Axes Recovered</p>
<p>Zhu Kouzi was a 23-year-old from Shaobo. He lost his father at a young age, and his mother remarried to Zhou Chaozhu, a Yangzhou native who ran a bathhouse and also worked as a boatman. Thus, Kouzi became an "oil bottle," brought into the Zhou family. However, Chaozhu treated him as his own, caring for him exceedingly. He came to Shanghai with Zhou and currently works as a clerk in a certain bathhouse. However, Zhou himself has five sons, none of whom are married. They reside in Fuxing Lane, Xinzha Road. Recently, someone acted as a matchmaker for Kouzi, arranging for him to marry Huang Huifang (19 years old), the sister of Yin Guangfa from the same village (Note: Huang Huifang's mother first married a Mr. Huang, gave birth to Huifang, and then remarried to the Yin family). The wedding ceremony was scheduled to be held yesterday at the Sanhe Lou Restaurant on West Xinqiao Street (Balibao Street) in the French Concession. The bride's residence was at Yin Guangfa's home at No. 21 Tongkang Lane, opposite the Slaughterhouse on Avenue Minny in the French Concession. At 8:15 PM, the ceremony was finally completed. The groom accompanied the bride back to the bride's residence for the returning visit. However, when the groom arrived at Tongkang Lane and was walking into the alley, just as he reached the entrance of the Cheng Yi Clothing Shop at No. 24, four assailants suddenly jumped out of the darkness, each wielding an axe, and attacked the groom Zhu Kouzi at random. Zhu was caught off guard, and his head, shoulders, and legs were severely wounded, causing him to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, bleeding profusely. The bride's residence was only two houses away. At that time, the relatives and friends were standing at the entrance, waiting for the groom. Upon seeing this drastic change, they rushed forward to rescue him and simultaneously apprehended the assailant. Zhou Chaozhu captured one of them on the spot and seized two axes. The crowd immediately sent the injured groom to Renji Hospital and escorted the assailant and the axes to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, the assailant identified himself as Lu Shanhai, stating that the other four assailants were hired by Zhou Kaitai to carry out the attack. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be detained and sent to the court for strict punishment. After the incident, reporters' investigations revealed that Zhou Kaitai was Zhou Chaozhu's son. The instigation of this attack was due to his resentment that his father did not arrange a marriage for his own sons but instead welcomed a son-in-law for the adopted son.</p>
<h3>New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Case Declared Not Guilty by the Court</h3>
<p>New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was searched and prosecuted by the Public Works Bureau Police for storing medicinal anesthetics and preparing various medical injections. The case was heard three times in the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Because this case had a significant impact on the interests of Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers, various public organizations, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Medical Association, and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, successively submitted petitions to the court, advocating fairness and requesting the maintenance of domestic goods manufacturers. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Judge Liu of the Eighth Criminal Court took the bench and announced that the manager of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Distinguishing Java Bank Counterfeit Notes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued an order to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of Java Bank counterfeit notes, as per the letter from the Consul General of the Netherlands, which was previously conveyed to you, it has now been learned that similar counterfeit 25-guilder notes have been discovered in the market, containing the watermark of 'JB.' These counterfeit notes are made by soaking the counterfeit notes in water and tearing them open, then inserting thin paper with the 'JB' watermark between the front and back sides and re-gluing them together. Therefore, when viewed against the light, the watermark appears clearer than the watermark on genuine notes. The remaining parts remain as described in the previous letter. This is specially conveyed to you for your reference." In response, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to conduct a strict investigation of the counterfeit notes, and it has been reported that the instructions have been followed. In view of the previous letter, the bureau is hereby ordered to comply with and handle this matter accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ancestral Land Sold Secretly by Uncle, Xu Jiaqing Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Xu Jiaqing, a 27-year-old from Yangzhou, opened the Hua Tong Barber Shop at No. 27 Tianmai Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Pudong, and the business was very good. Xu had two paternal uncles, named Guo Hui and Guo Chun, who secretly sold four mu of farmland under Xu Jiaqing's name in the countryside and squandered the money. Recently, Xu Jiaqing discovered this and intended to question Guo Hui and others, but Xu found it difficult to speak out due to the close relationship between uncle and nephew. In the end, it did not happen. However, he was depressed that his ancestral land had been secretly sold. Unexpectedly, the other night, he had the idea of committing suicide by swallowing raw opium and one Mexican dollar. After being discovered, he was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died at 10:00 AM yesterday.</p>

<h3>Former Soviet Assistance Association Staff Member Reveals Political Conspiracy of Commercial Organizations</h3>
<p>Russian Goods Dumped in China, Chinese Goods Exported to Russia Reduced</p>
<p>British Company Ostensibly Engaged in Espionage</p>
<p>Plotting to Assassinate Wang Jingwei, Transporting Leaflets and Declarations</p>
<p>Marie Responsible for Sending Letters to Newspapers</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Soviet Assistance Association at No. 2 Beijing Road in this city is the general organization for Soviet trade in China. A month ago, the association had a strange disappearance case of an employee. At the time, newspapers carried reports of this. Afterward, the missing employee, Marie, came to Shanghai on her own and surrendered to the First Special District Court for trial. It was learned that the so-called strange disappearance case was completely due to internal political disputes within the association and indirectly indicated that the existence of the Soviet Assistance Association was not merely a simple commercial organization. Recently, a reporter from a local Western newspaper interviewed Mr. Markov, the director of the association, and published an article on the recent trade situation between China and Russia. After reading it, Marie, in her capacity as a party involved, expressed that the article was untrue and was responsible for drafting "A Letter to Shanghai Newspapers" to correct the falsehoods in Mr. Markov's interview and reveal the inside story of the Soviet Assistance Association's secret political activities in China, including a plan to assassinate Premier Wang Jingwei. The letter was written on August 19. At that time, Marie had to leave urgently, so she entrusted the original letter to a friend in this city for dispatch. Now, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency has found the Chinese manuscript of the letter from a related source and is transcribing it as follows:</p>
<h3>Knowing the Hidden Matters in Detail</h3>
<p>To the Honorable Editor,</p>
<p>A local newspaper published an interview with Mr. Markov, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Russian Assistance Association, regarding the association's orderly and smooth exchange of Chinese and Russian goods. Mr. Markov made the following statement in the interview: "The Russian Assistance Association, that is, the Central United Association of Russian Consumer Cooperatives, benefits Great Britain and China." If you can provide me with the full facts collected from the newspaper, I would be grateful because I can correct many of the shortcomings in Mr. Markov's interview and explain Mr. Markov's concealment of the secret activities of the organization in China and elsewhere. I was in the position of a party involved, especially in the reporting of the company's business operations, because I was recently an employee of the company and the head of the export department. I know the hidden matters that Mr. Markov concealed in great detail.</p>
<h3>Beneficial to China in the Past Decade</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Markov, "The initial purpose of the Russian Assistance Association was to develop trade. The company is purely a sales organization for Soviet trusts." It can be seen that the company is purely a sales organization. The Soviet trusts transport goods, and they sell the goods to get commissions. This is the entire purpose of the Russian Assistance Association. If only judging by Mr. Markov's remarks, the Russian Assistance Association has no relation to Soviet policies and actions. Mr. Markov continued, "The main purpose of the Shanghai branch of the Russian Assistance Association is to develop trade and consolidate commercial relations between China and Russia." According to Mr. Markov's opinion, they have achieved victory in this regard. The victory that Mr. President observed is the fact that trade between the two major countries, China and Russia, has been quite beneficial to China in the past decade.</p>
<h3>Russian Goods Dumped, Fewer Chinese Goods Exported</h3>
<p>Of course, Mr. Markov (hereinafter, "Mr. Markov" refers to Markov) has the right to observe where Russia benefits, even in places where others see Russia losing money. If Mr. Markov argues based on facts, I do not want to refute him. However, I am very sorry to Mr. Markov, but I must argue with him and give some explanation on the extent of the beneficial Chinese trade volume. Mr. Markov cited a table of figures to prove that Chinese exports exceeded Russian imports between 1928 and 1923. This table of figures is quite comical and is a way for Soviet bureaucrats to laugh at the psychology of the readers. According to Mr. Markov, "The facts he cited are based on the records in the Chinese Economic Magazine." However, I have no such information. When was this magazine published, and does it have this table of figures? Where did Mr. Markov get this table? I think the reality is not like this. Why did Mr. Markov seek the numbers hidden in the magazine on Chinese magazines instead of adopting a convenient method, easy procedures, publishing his own commercial report, and the reliable accounts made by the accountant? I answer this question, or because the company is a British organization, and the business report of the Russian Assistance Association is completely different from what Mr. Markov said. As the former director of the Russian Assistance Association, I have the right to prove that trade between China and Russia is not only not beneficial to China's trade volume, but quite the contrary. The number of dumped goods from the Soviet Union to China now exceeds several times the number of Chinese goods imported into Russia.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Declining, Cement Industry Weakening</h3>
<p>I know the Soviet Union's trade plan with China this year very well. The Soviet government ordered the Russian Assistance Association to transport the following Chinese goods, 11 million Mexican yuan in timber, 4 million yuan in cotton textiles, 5.5 million in chemical products and building materials, and 3 million in cement, 2 million in fish, furs, medicines, wine, and fruits, totaling 22.5 million yuan. These are the Russian goods imported into China, while the only Chinese goods imported into Russia are tea leaves. According to Mr. Markov, "Last year, Chinese tea imported into Russia decreased to 3,187,940 yuan. According to this year's plan, Chinese tea imported into Russia should be reduced by 33% because Russia will buy tea from Java and other countries, and Russia will develop tea cultivation in its own country." If so, where is the benefit for trade with China? The extent to which the Soviet Union's dumping policy is implemented in China can be inferred from the protest submitted to the Soviet government by the China Cement Industry Association through the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, opposing the Soviet Union's dumping policy, endangering China's cement industry production, and the possible shutdown of factories.</p>
<h3>British Company Registered in London</h3>
<p>The Russian Cooperative Society is considered a British company, and therefore Mr. Ma has been vigorously disrupting the business of British merchants Bluethner and Mende. Because these two British merchants continuously transport chemical products such as sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate to China and reduce prices, the Russian Cooperative Society attempted to collude with these two British merchants to jointly eliminate the Chinese soda industry in Tianjin and then eliminate their British allies (referring to the two British merchants). This plan was devised by Mr. Ma and Mr. Babich, and I was to participate in implementing this plan. However, the main significance of Mr. Ma's speech was not only about the commercial activities of the company. Mr. Ma insisted on two points: (1) The Russian Cooperative Society is a British merchant; (2) It is a purely commercial organization and does not engage in any political activities. The Russian Cooperative Society is registered in London according to British commercial law, so the company is protected by British law. This point must be clear. The company enjoys the protection of the British administrative organs, and the British administrative organs are also responsible for the company's actions to a considerable extent. As for after the registration, I seriously deny that the company is a purely commercial organization, because the facts have proven otherwise. I present several facts to Mr. Ma, which he knows in detail, no less than I do.</p>
<h3>Personnel of the Special Agent Expert Association</h3>
<p>(1) The staff of the Russian Cooperative Society in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou are all appointed by Moscow. The staff sent from the Shanghai branch to Tianjin and Hankou are all carried out according to the instructions of Moscow, directly approved by the Overseas Department of the Communist Party Central Committee, and agreed by the Overseas Intelligence Department. Moreover, the principle of dispatch is not based on whether someone has knowledge of the Chinese market, commercial knowledge, or knowledge of China. The principle is that they are Communist Party members and Cheka workers, or have participated in the work of special agent organs. As for the level of commercial knowledge, it has no effect at all. Through such procedures, Markov, Babich, Yakimenko, Mikhailov, Dannecker, Sheingarten, Marysheva, Kautsrauff, Leffanoff, Tsailouhoff, and others were sent to China. In addition, I would like to remind Mr. Ma of the past achievements of the above-mentioned commercial organization. A. Babich joined the Communist Party in 1918. From 1919 to 1925, he worked in the Cheka organization of the Gendarmerie Special Agent Department. From 1925 to 1930, he worked as a foreign agent for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I advise you (Markov) to ask Babich how many Chinese people he arrested in Moscow and other cities during the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929, and how many Chinese people were arrested under his orders. This is Babich's specialty. In addition, he also has the special skill of forging Chinese passports and signatures. Babich is a China expert familiar with the Chinese business market and a Chinese tea expert. B. Mikhailov once served as a Cheka inspector and night security commander, and later became the leader of the Cheka in Central Asia. He joined the Communist Party in 1919 and was sent to the Russian Cooperative Society in Shanghai to serve as an expert in the knitting department. C. Dannecker is a Communist Party member who has suppressed the anti-revolutionary movement in the Ivanovo-Voznesensk region and was sent to the Russian Cooperative Society as an expert in the textile department. D. Yakimenko was the founder of the Komsomol and an agent of the Special Agent Department. He was sent to work as a timber expert in the timber department. To prove that he was an expert, he obtained a fake graduation certificate signed by the president of the Moscow Forestry Institute. Yakimenko told me personally that if he wanted to get it, he could also get an engineering mechanic's certificate, but this was a very big political issue. Sheryebroff, the manager of the timber department, once made a vivid statement about Yakimenko's knowledge. He said, "With experts like Yakimenko, the entire forest of Abelia can be sold for 250 gold." E. Kautsrauff, when he came here, had already set up an economic bureau to serve as a business expert in the Ministry of Commerce. He did not waste national currency in the Oriental Communist Party School in Moscow, but learned Chinese. The rest of the people sent here are also similar. They were not sent here for their commercial knowledge, but for their qualifications as experts in secret political work. In conclusion, the above few words are a reply to Mr. Ma's statement that the Russian Cooperative Society does not engage in political activities.</p>
<h3>Various Plots to Assassinate Mr. Wang</h3>
<p>2. Mikhailov transported a certain amount of US dollars to Tianjin in April 1933. I know there were 38,000 yuan, which were transferred to the Chinese people waiting there. Mr. Mi himself did not return from Tianjin. He reported to the "Three-Person Fighting Group" there. Those who participated in the group were Markov, Dannecker, me, and Yakimenko as a substitute. The content of the report was that the Chinese Communist Army has made great progress and will soon occupy Xiamen. 3. The specific purpose of Beykauff's trip to Hankou at the end of March this year was to intercept Bi Qiankao. If he refused to work for the Soviet Union, he would be killed. From this, it can be seen more clearly whether it is a purely commercial organization. 4. Or you (referring to Markov) still remember, otherwise I should call you a person with poor memory. You and Babich entrusted me with the task of assassinating Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of China. I did not carry it out. Because of this, you and Babich severely criticized me. You and Babich believed that Wang Jingwei was a deadly enemy of the Soviet Union. According to Babich, Wang Jingwei was even worse than Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek." Later, Babich reported and exposed me for not wanting to carry out the task. 5. What method did Babich use to intercept Griffith Reed and force him to return to Russia? Otherwise, he would be killed on the way. Although you knew about this matter late, you also understood the preparations. This matter was assisted by a lawyer in the cooperative society and was ready. 6. You (referring to Markov), Dannecker, and I boarded the "Neva Stroi" ship from New Russia to Shanghai on April 23 and 24 this year. We reviewed the leaflets and declarations that were brought on board. Part of them were in Chinese, and part of them, as the captain said, were to be sent to Cuba. The ship also transported 450 tons of cement and hundreds of boxes of glass to Shanghai. I would like to cite many more specific facts about the commercial activities of the Russian Cooperative Society, but this is enough to answer Mr. Ma's statement. I also hope to have the opportunity to clarify the purpose and tasks of the Russian Cooperative Society in the newspaper in the future. Maryson, August 19, 1933.</p>

Its business methods eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the old methods and adopt new-style exchange methods, which are very preferential to customers, with simple procedures, low exchange fees, and fast delivery. It can be said to be convenient and reliable. Regardless of whether it is Hong Kong, Guangzhou City, or various village remittances, they can all be delivered to the address. There are several types of remittances: telegraphic transfer, airmail transfer, express mail transfer, and draft. No matter how much the remittance is, it is welcome. It is heard that the bank is scheduled to open on September 1, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>National Silk Exhibition Scheduled to Hold Closing Ceremony</h3>
<p>The China National Silk Exhibition, organized by four groups including the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Silk and Satin Industry Guild, and Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Guild, has been open since July 9. It has been more than a month since then. Manufacturers have successively transported their products to the exhibition, which is full of beautiful things. Visitors have been flocking to the exhibition. It is now known that the conference is scheduled to close on September 1. On the afternoon of that day, at 1:00 p.m., the closing ceremony will be held in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo will be invited to attend the conference and deliver a speech.

The Ministry of Industry has also been approved to issue certificates of excellence for the products, to encourage them. At the time of early autumn, manufacturers are competing to display new and novel autumn clothing materials every day as the closing is approaching, which is quite enough to arouse the envy of people at home and abroad. The documents submitted by the conference to the Ministry of Industry and the letters sent to celebrities from all walks of life are recorded below. Documents submitted to the Ministry of Industry are submitted for the purpose of application. The subordinate association opened on July 9 this year to hold a national silk exhibition to promote it. First of all, the ministry was honored to send Vice Minister Liu Weichi to attend the opening day and deliver a speech. The subordinate association is scheduled to close on September 1. All the products of the factories have been organized by the review committee and the review has been completed. It is planned to select the best ones and give awards on the closing day. It is planned to determine 58 award winners. A few days ago, the association sent Yang Zhenxin, a mediator of the association, to present the awards and request the ministry to approve and seal the awards to show encouragement. At the same time, I would also like to ask the minister to attend the closing ceremony at 1:00 p.m. on September 1 to deliver a speech and present the awards to show solemnity. Since the day of closing is approaching, the above-mentioned awards are very urgent. Therefore, I hereby submit another document to request the ministry to quickly seal and issue the awards to facilitate the process, which is for the public convenience. The letter to celebrities from all walks of life says, "We will hold a closing ceremony at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 p.m. on September 1.

<p>One Boatman Drowned</p>
<p>The Association Requests Compensation</p>
<p>The Ningbo liner "Xinjiangtian" of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company came to Shanghai from Ningbo on Saturday morning. After entering the port, the ship sailed to Jinliyuan Wharf. As usual, the ship had to turn around. At that time, the tide was very fast. When the "Xinjiangtian" turned around, a fishing boat anchored north of the fish market in Nan City's Shiliupu was violently hit by the ship's body when it turned around. The fishing boat was immediately broken and the entire boat sank into the Huangpu River. It was found that the fishing boat belonged to Xi Liugen, a native of Qingdun, Chuansha. It was loaded with fresh fish to Shiliupu to sell to various shops. The boat was docked on the bank of the Huangpu River, ready to unload, when it suddenly encountered a disaster. The fishing boat immediately broke apart. The river water rushed into the boat, and it sank in an instant. The boatmen in the boat, Xi Liugen and two others, were unable to escape and drowned in the center of the river with the boat. For a time, the order of the Shiliupu River surface was in chaos. Fortunately, there were many nearby fishing boats and punts, etc., which competed to salvage and rescue. As a result, two of the three people who fell into the water, including Xi Liugen, were rescued. However, the boatman surnamed Han had already drowned in the Huangpu River, and his body had not been recovered. As for all the fish cargo, etc., they all sank and could not be salvaged, so the owner of the fishing boat, Xi Liugen, suffered a great loss. After this incident occurred, the victim, Xi Liugen, reported the details and the various losses of the sunken boat and cargo, as well as the death of one boatman, to the Fisheries Association and requested that it come forward to negotiate. On the one hand, he sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company requesting compensation for the damage and pensions for the drowned boatman. Because the victim Han's family has an old mother who is sixty years old, who depends on him for a living. Now that he has drowned, how will she survive? Yesterday, the Fisheries Association officially sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to negotiate and give a pension to the deceased. It is heard that the company has agreed to this matter.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Guidebook Published</h3>
<p>Qingdao is surrounded by mountains and the sea, with beautiful scenery and pleasant climate. It is warm in winter and cool in summer, with a moderate climate. Traveling there is truly a spiritual area for sightseeing and a dwelling for entertainment. Since the Qingdao branch of the China Travel Service was established in 1930, it has been serving people and facilitating travel. Chinese and foreign ladies who travel there have the joy of returning home. Now, the company believes that there is a lack of special books for tourists to explore the scenic spots. Therefore, the "Qingdao Guidebook" is published, which details scenic spots, itineraries, traffic notes, social notes, products, and commodities. It also includes illustrations and photographs, no less than dozens of frames. Everything about Qingdao can be said to be detailed and exhaustive. At the end of the book, there is a category of arts and literature, which contains Mr. Ye Xia'an's "Qingqiu Travel Scraps," Mr. Chuan Yuanshu's "Travel to Laoshan Ji," and Mr. Li Yi's "Laoshan Travelogue," which makes this book even more colorful. The description is detailed and can be used for reference. The writing is beautiful, which is another thing. The whole book is bound in a thick volume and printed in fine Daolin paper. Each book is only sold for two yuan. An additional two and a half cents will be added for postage for mail orders. Distribution locations are the China Travel Service and branches on Sichuan Road, Shanghai Bank, and major bookstores in various ports.</p>
<h3>A Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning Because She Does Not Want to Return to Her Hometown to Suffer</h3>
<p>Wang Jinfu, a native of Jiangbei, lives on the third floor of the Asia Shipping Company on Xin Kaihe, French Concession. His wife, Zhang, is 24 years old. Wang used to work as a waiter on a ship, but is now unemployed, resulting in a sudden economic strain. Yesterday, he suddenly discussed with Zhang and asked her to move back to his hometown temporarily. Once there is an opportunity, he will come to Shanghai again. Unexpectedly, she has lived at sea for a long time and has been influenced by what she has seen and heard. She does not want to move back to her poor and remote hometown, and she has a feeling of world-weariness. She secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. After being discovered, she was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. She died at 9:45 that evening.</p>
<h3>The Zhou Laowu Assassination Case is Concluded</h3>
<p>Shang Wu, the Chinese detective of the Dithers Road Police Station, and Liu Decheng, the detective, previously arrested Wu Gengsheng, Xu Abao, Shi Zusheng, Wu Sibao, and other suspects, including Yang Liangrong and Xia Chengliang, who were accused of killing Zhou Laowu, the railway news vendor. They were brought to the First Special District Local Court for several trials and ordered to be detained for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Su Xieffen of the Special Court attended the Second Criminal Court for a continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, claimed that during the postponement, a detailed investigation was conducted. In addition to the four defendants Wang, Xu, Shi, and Wu, who had confessed in the previous court, there was no corroborating evidence for Yang and Xia's involvement in the case, which was pointed out by Shi Zusheng. It was found that Xia Chengliang had financial dealings with the bank. He had a passbook at the China Industrial Bank. The small check income received in February, March, and April of this year had receipts, and there was no withdrawal of 300 yuan. There was also no such 300 yuan in the Beijing Road Guohua Bank in February and March. The Shanghai Bank on the boundary road was in May, and there was no relationship. Shi's claim that he paid 300 yuan was not true. Regarding his previous work with Zhou in Minsheng News Agency, Zhou was in charge of major newspapers, and Xia was in charge of minor newspapers. Zhou received a monthly allowance of 20 yuan. They each performed their duties. When Zhou took over the Daily News Association, Xia was still in charge of minor newspapers, and there was no allowance. Shi previously confessed that Xia gave him 200 yuan to kill Zhou at 5:00 p.m. on March 19. However, Xia was not in Shanghai on that day. He invited his friend Wang Wanchang to Suzhou to adopt a son. He set off on the 16th and returned to Shanghai at 7:00 p.m. on the 19th. The pen and ink of Wang's adopted son was written by Xia. It has now been brought to the case as evidence. Rong Hengxing, a tea waiter at Lai Fenglou, also claimed that he knew Xia and Shi well, but had never seen them drinking tea at the same table. It was found that Shi applied for a pass from Xia at Minsheng News Agency, totaling 60 yuan, but only paid 40 yuan. He was asked for the balance but was not given it. Later, the agency was cancelled, and the Daily News Association was changed on March 1. The pass was invalid, and Shi lost his job. After Zhou's death, he sought work from Xia in May. Xia asked for the owed money, which caused a gap. It was found that the defendant Yang Liangrong worked at the Electric Power Company. He had a fixed time to enter and exit, and there was a signature book for verification. The defendant Shi Zusheng's previous confession of gathering at Lai Fenglou on certain dates was also inconsistent. It was originally intended to bring the company's signature book to the case, but because there were many workers, they had to sign every day, so it could not be brought. The police upheld justice in the investigation of the defendants' evidence. Then, the ink of Wang Wanchang's adopted son written by Xia was presented for inspection. Subsequently, Wang Wanchang, Rong Hengxing, a tea waiter at Lai Fenglou, Chen Keming, the former manager of Minsheng News Agency, and Xu Xinyi, an employee of the Daily News Association, each arrived in court to testify about the details. Yang Liangrong and Xia Chengliang then successively confessed to the facts of being falsely accused by Shi and requested a clear understanding. Finally, Chen Tingrui, the lawyer for the defendant Xia Chengliang, and the police lawyer argued with each other for a long time. The official ordered a scheduled verdict. The defendants Wang Gengsheng, Shi Zusheng, Xu Abao, and Wu Sibao were returned to custody. Yang Liangrong and Xia Chengliang each paid a deposit of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiufu Company Factory Building Owner Disputes</h3>
<p>The Jiufu Company in this port has recently been revitalized and reorganized by the new manager Gu Kemin. After hosting a banquet for colleagues from various industries, its business is booming. Its products, such as Bailinji, are a wonderful tonic. Jiufu milky white cod liver oil is a top-quality nutritional supplement, pure and containing several kinds of tonic power. It is especially a symptomatic and effective medicine for treating lungs and coughs. The demand is increasing after autumn, and the business is reviving. However, the factory building is the property of Huang Chu Jiu. It was leased to the company by Huang. Since Huang's death, lawsuits have arisen due to his debt relationship. The house is also related to Huang's debt to the China Industrial Bank Wanchun Silver Group. The creditors seized the deed No. 12201, covering an area of three acres, three minutes, four cents, and eight hairs; deed No. 7804, covering an area of thirteen acres, eight minutes, two cents; deed No. 4044, covering an area of three minutes and two hairs; deed No. 2451, covering an area of two minutes and nine cents; and the houses on the land applied for provisional attachment. The court ruled to post a provisional attachment notice, but it has nothing to do with the tenants of the houses, so it has nothing to do with Jiufu Company. Moreover, the company's business is improving and progressing steadily.</p>

<h3>Women's Organizations Affected by the Global Recession</h3>
<p>The editorial department of the Young Women's Christian Association at No. 19 Yuanyuan Road, Shanghai, was originally assisted by Dr. Nail of the United States, who promised to develop the written business with 10,000 US dollars. The association received 5,000 US dollars and published the "Le Yin" monthly magazine and the "Young Women's Christian Association" monthly magazine for two years. There are also more than ten kinds of books, which have achieved great results. Recently, due to the financial panic in the United States and various other reasons, the remaining 5,000 US dollars cannot be continued to the association. Therefore, the written business of the association has been hit. It is heard that the "Le Yin" monthly magazine is bound to cease publication, and books cannot be continued to be published. The editorial department is implementing staff cuts and reducing administration, and reducing the scope. This is also the impact of the global economic recession on women's organizations.</p>
<h3>City News</h3>
<p>"Train Brand" Thermos Bottles Specially Approved for Tax Exemption. The "Train Brand" thermos bottles produced by Shanghai Zhenye Thermos Bottle Factory have been well received by people from all walks of life since they were launched on the market. It is now heard that the factory has obtained special permission from the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to sell them domestically, exempting them from half tax, and completely exempting them from tax when shipped abroad.

<p>Huahua Silk and Satin Company Makes Great Sacrifices. Huahua Silk and Satin Company, located at the corner of Shilu Crossing on Third Horse Road, Shanghai, has always been committed to promoting domestic silk and satin. The selection of goods is done by sending personnel directly to the factory to select them. Therefore, since its opening, the business has been developed, and the reputation of low prices and good quality has long been praised by all walks of life. However, in recent times, the market has been depressed in all industries, and the sales of silk goods to foreign ports have not been developed, resulting in the accumulation of inventory in various factories. If they want to promote sales and benefit production, they have to sacrifice and sell cheaply. It is heard that the company plans to sell all goods cheaply from September 1, in order to promote the sale of autumn goods and to promote the new and eliminate the old, regardless of sacrifice, only to promote the sales of domestic silk, in order to fulfill the original intention of promoting domestic goods.</p>

<h3>The Definition of Death</h3>
<p>— Gu Xizhang</p>
<p>Separation in life and death is the greatest pain and the greatest regret in life. But who can escape this painful ordeal? Who can avoid the occurrence of this regret?</p>
<p>However, when a person is born, they will eventually die; when there is gathering, there will be separation. As the saying goes, there is no feast that doesn't end. This is the immutable law of nature.</p>
<p>Yet, in this contradictory and deformed modern society, there are many fortunate people who seek longevity, and there are also many pitiful creatures who fear not dying and hasten their own deaths.</p>
<p>If we try to browse the social news columns in the newspaper, the striking headlines are nothing but: "A certain young man, unable to make a living, reached the end of his road and jumped into the river!" "So-and-so committed suicide due to unemployment and inability to maintain a livelihood!" "So-and-so committed suicide by taking poison due to economic pressure!" They have no way to prolong their pitiful souls, they cannot maintain their pitiful bodies until the final day of natural collapse, and they have no choice but to abandon all those who depend on them – father, mother, wife, and children – violating the laws of nature to seek the path of death. Death is painful, but they believe that the pain of death can resolve the greater pain of living.</p>
<p>High-ranking officials and prominent gentlemen have superior positions, awe-inspiring authority, enormous wealth, and beautiful wives and concubines. All their lives they fear that they will not enjoy enough and want to pray for immortality, hoping that the god of death will never descend. But the god of death is ruthless; it is the same for everyone.</p>
<p>Thus, by observing the acceptance or rejection of the word "death," we can discern two opposing camps in society.</p>
<h3>Beggar Liu</h3>
<p>— Chunhua</p>
<p>Seeing beggars everywhere in Shanghai, I presume to offer a superficial study of beggars.</p>
<p>The American scholar G. L. Gilliin said in the American Journal of Sociology: "In ancient times, there were no beggars in society. It was only a kind of person from a certain ethnic group traveling abroad and stranded in a foreign land, who later received relief from philanthropists. This is the beginning of begging."</p>
<p>However, the facts now tell us that the wandering of Chinese beggars on the streets and alleys is the result of the chaos in the commercial economy and the failure of handicrafts due to the prosperity of machinery. So it is also right to say: "The discovery of beggars in society indicates a kind of social and economic disorganization." Of course, a person cannot exchange mind and strength for bread and food. He can only sell his personality to beg, which is the most shameful thing. But, without begging, without working, and without work, life is impossible. What if you don't beg? So beggars also fill society.</p>
<p>European countries are very strict in suppressing beggars. They all implement forced labor. The Netherlands has set up three workplaces for beggars, Portugal has also established many factories for beggars to work in, and Belgium has also established large-scale beggar shelters. Germany established more than thirty places to accommodate beggars after the war. But China alone is lacking. Should this not be a cause for regret?</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a little feeling, that the founding of European countries is based on the lives of the people, and the joys and sorrows of the people are the objects. However, China is separated from the people and is fighting fiercely. Not to mention the internal chaos that has made the people unable to live, after the natural disasters, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes are still frequently placed on the people's shoulders, making it impossible to hold their heads up. Otherwise, people are not plants, who would not like to live a peaceful life at home, but would rather work as wandering beggars outside. Beggars have been created, why doesn't the authorities eagerly add factories to accommodate these homeless and hungry beggars, and can't the government's credibility be increased through this?</p>
<h3>Modern Girls</h3>
<p>— Hutou</p>
<p>Girls, girls, mentioning the word "girl" seems to have a kind of magic power, worthy of the attention of young boys, and especially those young girls, who have the ability to captivate souls. Originally, the charm of a young girl is enough to express the natural beauty of a virgin. No wonder the debauched sons and the playboy princes are doing the confused dreams of chasing the opposite sex all day long!</p>
<p>There are three types of modern girls here, which can be analyzed by the words "upper," "middle," and "lower" to classify their ranks.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the "lower" class: Most of these girls are from Jiangbei. Their parents mostly hold small iron hammers, specializing in knocking bricks and stones to arrange three-in-one soil; or carrying broken baskets, searching for things in the garbage piles that are "not happy to pick up and not reluctant to throw away." These girls, who have been accustomed to this from an early age, never think about how to live in the future, so as soon as they open their eyes, they follow suit and do these jobs. They don't have a clean moment on their bodies all day long, and they look dirtier than the kiln workers! Why do I position them? So put them in the "lower" class.</p>
<p>Next, we want to talk about the "middle" class; the degree and qualifications of these girls are relatively higher; perhaps some of them know a few simple words. Probably her father works in the industrial and commercial sector, with a meager monthly income, so her mother has to take her to work in a yarn factory or cigarette factory to subsidize the family. This is a very good small family with a one-husband-one-wife division of labor. As the girls get older, they are too worried about leaving them alone at home, especially in Shanghai, which is full of temptations, so they have to bring them to the factory to help with some work. These factories, when the market is good, can produce one or two yuan a day, which is not a very difficult thing! Because they earn money so easily, they always want to save some money to make a new dress to wear, and it is so pleasant to go in and out with their little girlfriends! After the January 28th Incident, many Chinese and foreign factories closed down, so these little girlfriends who relied on this to make a living were panic-stricken! Some girls who were clever and quick-witted envied the comfortable lives of dancing girls and prostitutes, and changed their careers one after another, so the number of those who fell increased day by day.</p>
<p>The "upper" class girls can be considered the most carefree. When they are young, they reach out to ask for pocket money; when they reach school age, they go to school in a daze. They are nominally studying, but in fact, they don't know a few words when the school year ends. They read up year after year, and the expenses add up year after year. Fortunately, their fathers and brothers have a lot of money and don't care. Who knows that after studying for many years, science and literature have not improved; but what can be improved rapidly is writing "Brother! Love!"? Disgusting love letters, so after graduating from school, they just wait for the auspicious day to come: If someone important comes to propose marriage, they are willing to be concubines.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Difficulty in Finding a Spouse, Hesitating and Worrying about the Future, Gathering with Friends and Feeling Embarrassed about the Past</p>
<p>But his wife wrote a letter saying that the child was sick, and the jewelry had been pawned. He still had no intention of going home. Why does a person hate his family so much? Does this mean that it is better not to have family? Wait, let me ask Yin Deren. He is a bachelor, so what exactly is going on? I have to ask him. He thought to himself for a while, and then ran to Yin Deren's company. Yin Deren was very happy, supporting himself with both hands, and lifting a heavy tripod in the house. Zhao Ziqiang said: Hey! You're really strong. After the inspection, you'll be a god. Yin Deren patted the dust off his hands and said with a smile: Even if I don't pass the inspection, I'm still happy like this. In my heart, it's always empty, without worrying about anything or thinking about anything. Why wouldn't I be happy? Zhao Ziqiang was just about to lead him into the topic, so he smiled and said: Who is worried about anything, who is thinking about anything? Yin Deren smiled and said: Does this need to be said? You are thinking about your wife all day long now. Zhao Ziqiang took out a box of cigarettes from his pocket, took one, and slowly smoked it. Then he smiled and said: Old Yin, why don't you want a wife? Yin Deren took the box of cigarettes he had placed on the table, took one, put it in his mouth, and then found a match on the table. He lifted one foot and rubbed the match on the sole of his shoe, lit the cigarette, and then lay sideways on his small bed, shaking his legs up in a high frame. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: I'm talking to you, what kind of affectation is this? Yin Deren just lay on the bed and spat out smoke, not saying anything. Zhao Ziqiang said: What's wrong with you? I'm discussing something with you, and you're going to give me the cold shoulder. Yin Deren jumped down from the bed and said: You have something to discuss with me, why don't you say it? Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: Actually, you know my intention, you're just pretending to be stupid. Yin Deren patted him on the shoulder and said with a smile: Don't ask me about this. Ask Little Tian. He can give you an answer. Haven't you heard people say? "Better to lose a job than lose a marriage." (173)</p>
<h3>"Permit"</h3>
<p>— Yiyiguan Master</p>
<p>Rich people, after buying a car, the first and most important thing is to "get a permit." Naturally, with a car, you need a "permit." Without a "permit," the car is just for show, it can only be displayed at home and cannot be driven out. Otherwise, when the police officers see your car without a "permit," hum! "Tycoons" don't matter. Official business is handled according to official regulations. If you don't donate for a "permit," there is only the method of paying a fine, nothing else. Otherwise, why are there so many cars speeding on the roads all day long, and not a single one can be found without a "permit"?</p>
<p>Originally, "permits" like this are very widely used. Not only cars need "permits," but also any other vehicles, and even small-business hawkers cannot be without "permits."</p>
<p>However, the "permit" for a car is a bit elaborate. As far as I know, the number on the "permit" must be special. Being able to get a consecutive-number "permit" shows how rich you are. Because this kind of "permit" requires special spending and finding ways to get it. Therefore, having obtained this kind of "permit," the car can run rampant on the road, and the police officers will give you some leeway because of the "permit"!</p>
<p>Alas! "Permits" are good for taking advantage, and it's not just cars that are like this. If I tell you, and you don't believe it, please go to the tram or bus, and you can see clearly. Those gentlemen who claim to understand civilized manners seem to not see the old ladies with wrinkled skin and white hair, and they sit still without moving. But when they see modern and beautiful young girls, they are really energetic, even if the car is shaking so much that they can't stand still, they have no choice but to grab the rattan circle and stand up, respectfully inviting the girls to sit. This is because the girls' "permit" is good, and they get the men's "support." As for the men's "permit" being good for taking advantage of the women, I am not gossiping. It is often heard that mistresses give money to "pretty boys," which is nothing strange. In short, "permits" are good for taking advantage. Believe it or not, it's up to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhao Gu Ni, a calligrapher and seal carver from my hometown (Changshu), named Shi, courtesy name Gu Ni, also known as Shi Nong, is skilled in calligraphy, inheriting the essence of Weng Songchan. He is also skilled in epigraphy, and his use of the seal carving knife is naturally exquisite. In Jiangnan, apart from Wu Changshuo, Gu Ni can be regarded as second to none. Recently, I heard of his passing away, so I have compiled his life's anecdotes to let those who care about epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting know a general idea of his life.</p>
<p>Gu Ni used to be an apprentice in a pharmacy. It is said that the store was set up by Prime Minister Weng Songchan's family. Every day he saw the joy of Songchan practicing calligraphy and took the leftover scraps of paper to imitate him. After a long time, he gradually resembled him. Songchan was also happy to be his teacher, so he tried his best to study and gradually gained entry. At that time, the seals for couplets, etc., written by Songchan were also engraved by Gu Ni. After Songchan returned to the mountains, many people wanted to get Weng's calligraphy, so Gu Ni imitated his style to meet the demand. Those who asked were satisfied and left. Later, it became difficult to distinguish whether it was Weng's calligraphy or Zhao's writing, and his seals were also the same as Songchan's. Even experts could not tell the difference. To this day, many of the Weng's calligraphy in Beijing and Tianjin are written by Zhao.</p>
<p>Gu Ni is not famous for his calligraphy, but for his seal carving. Shanghai calligraphers and painters all call Gu Ni an expert in iron pen (seal carving), but not his calligraphy. He once studied with Wu Changshuo and titled his studio "Baican Studio." When Wu Changshuo was alive, he also recognized him as a talented person. Now, the grass on Changshuo's grave is green, and Gu Ni has also been sleeping underground for a long time.</p>
<p>Gu Ni was fond of tea. He was often heard sitting in Changshu's Xiaoyao You, talking about tea by the window. He usually joked with his literary friends Wu 𤍠. Friends, young and old, gathered together and called him Uncle Shi. Those who didn't know him suspected that his surname was Shi, not Zhao. He was always smiling and approachable, never speaking harshly or angrily. His beautiful beard on both cheeks was several inches long, quite like Yu Youren, but shorter than Yu Youren, which was also a strange appearance.</p>
<p>In the past, when Sun Chuanfang was the governor of Jiangsu, someone asked Gu Ni to carve two seals to give to Sun. Gu Ni demanded a price of one hundred taels of gold, otherwise he would not carve. Someone offered him sixty taels of gold. Gu Ni stroked his beard and laughed, saying, "Is Sun Chuanfang's seal only worth sixty taels of gold?" After saying that, he laughed loudly. Later, he never got it, and someone never asked again. Gu Ni's move had a bit of George Bernard Shaw's humor.</p>
<p>Gu Ni had no descendants, only one daughter, named Lin, who was also skilled in calligraphy and seal carving. Ordinary letters and seals were all done by his daughter. People could not distinguish the authenticity. After Gu Ni's death, his daughter Lin published her self-imposed price list in Changshu Qin News, exchanging seal carving for money to support her mother. She had been betrothed to the son of the calligrapher Su Tuian in my hometown. Currently, she has not yet married due to her father's death. She used to be a clerk in a court in Suzhou, but now she is reading books behind closed doors, taking seal carving as her livelihood.</p>
<p>Gu Ni was an enlightened person during his lifetime and planned for things after his death in advance. When he was put into the coffin, his clothes and shoes were the ordinary ones he wore. The price of the coffin was only worth forty taels of gold, and he left a will that no paper money should be burned, no Taoist priests or monks should be invited to perform rituals, no obituary or funeral should be held, and no feng shui master should be invited to choose a burial site. He sold a piece of land outside Zao Cheng Gate, only three bows in size, as Gu Ni's burial ground. Backed by mountains and facing a lake, the scenery is excellent. To be buried with famous people in the depths of famous mountains is naturally a lot of glory, and the Yuan painter Huang Gongwang and the Qing painter Weng Songchan are buried next to each other. The night table will definitely not be lonely.</p>
<p>When Gu Ni was about to die, a cousin from his clan came from the countryside, wanting to be his heir. Gu Ni refused and divided three hundred taels of gold to his two cousins, instructing them to take good care of themselves and work diligently. People asked him why, and he said, "If a son is virtuous or not, I still cannot take care of his future, let alone a cousin? I already have a daughter who can continue my lineage, why must I have a son?" His open-mindedness is something that ordinary people cannot match.</p>
<p>When Gu Ni was ill, he wielded his brush day and night to clear his calligraphy debts. After the calligraphy debts were cleared, he held the seal carving knife all day long. Later, when his illness worsened, he still lay on his pillow and did it. After his death, there were no outstanding requests for his calligraphy or seals, as if he knew he was going to die. When he finished carving the last seal, he couldn't help but sigh and say, "The unfinished business has been cleared up." After Gu Ni's death, his fellow townsmen Gui Jiong and others solicited Gu Ni's posthumous works, intending to publish a special album to commemorate their friendship, and also solicited poems and elegies to publish a condolence record to留纪念云。</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Textbooks Should Still Be Examined According to Regulations</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education stating that according to the regulations for the examination of textbooks by the Ministry, publishing houses submitting textbooks for examination should submit five copies of the entire book to the Ministry for examination. Any unfinished textbooks will not be examined. However, since the promulgation of the new curriculum standards for primary schools, publishing houses have been rushing to compile textbooks suitable for the new curriculum standards, and many have not followed the regulations to submit them for examination. In order to take into account actual needs, the Ministry of Education has allowed flexibility and allowed various books to be submitted for examination successively. Now, various primary school textbooks have been examined and approved in sequence and are sufficient for use. Starting from September 15th, publishing houses submitting primary school textbooks for examination should still follow the textbook examination regulations. No more unfinished primary school textbooks should be submitted for examination piecemeal. You are hereby instructed to inform all publishing houses under your jurisdiction to comply with this order.</p>

<p>Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College Establishes Physical Education Lectures</p>
<p>Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College has recently been making vigorous improvements. In addition to hiring more faculty and staff, it has also established physical education lectures, inviting physical education specialists to lecture on various specialized topics in phases to enhance the future service capabilities of students.

The addition of physical education lectures and the invitation of specialists to lecture on various specialized topics are underway. The lecturers and the topics they plan to lecture on are as follows: Shen Silang, President of St. John's University, will lecture on the trends and current status of physical education in the United States; Zhang Xinfu, Director of the Physical Education Department of Central University, will lecture on physical education and the future of the nation; Cheng Dengke, a graduate of the University of Berlin in Germany, will lecture on new trends in European physical education and the current status of physical education in Germany; Jiang Xiangqing, former facilitator of the National Physical Education Promotion Association and current editor of the education column of the Shishi Xinbao, will lecture on physical education and the press; Wu Bangwei, Director of the Zhenjiang Provincial Public Sports Field, will lecture on the organization and preparation of sports meets and practical experience in sports meets; Zhang Zhongfan, Director of the Nanjing Public Sports Field, will lecture on the implementation of mass sports; Rong Qizhao, President of the Jiangnan University Sports Association, will lecture on the organization and administration of sports associations; Ling Xitao, the facilitator of the Youth Association's Sports Department, will lecture on the organization and administration of the Youth Association's Sports Department; and Yu Hengzhi, Director of Physical Education at Jinan University, will lecture on team management and practical experience in team expeditions.

<p>Lifeng Elementary School Half-Fee Quota Will Soon Be Full</p>
<p>Lifeng Elementary School, located at No. 201 near Sapo Road and Ximen Road, has specially set up a half-fee quota of fifty students.

This shows the large number of people in society who are unable to afford the high tuition fees due to their poor financial circumstances, causing their children to miss out on education. It is heard that the school's remaining quota will soon be full, and those who arrive late may have regrets.</p>

<p>Diary of the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships (7)</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from London by Yizhi</p>
<p>July 5 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Today, two matches of widely differing levels each required four sets to determine the winner, ultimately leading to Barnes and Crawford entering the final of the men's singles championship. In the first match, there was little doubt from the start of the fourth set that Henry Cochet, a two-time champion, would lose to Barnes. Sato's defeat to Crawford, on the other hand, was a stubborn resistance, and his last-ditch effort almost succeeded, making a fifth set possible. These were the two noteworthy matches of the day. The weather changed suddenly, with a sharp drop in temperature and a lively breeze swirling around the center court. The sun was obscured by clouds, and outerwear and blankets naturally appeared. The crowd was not as dense as on Saturday, but the main court was packed to the rafters, with no space left.</p>
<p>Miss Landy and Mrs. Mathieu won against Miss Stamm and Miss Jarejoska in the first group match on the center court in a short amount of time. Barnes, almost bored and drowsy, arrived at the court at exactly 2:30 PM when he had finished his match. Cochet was already in the locker room, hesitating whether to wear his newly made shorts. As the heat had suddenly subsided, he decided to stick with long pants. Barnes quickly changed, and the two went onto the court together.</p>
<p>In the first few games, both were extremely cautious, fearing mistakes. In the third game, Barnes won Cochet's serve due to Cochet's error and took a 3-1 lead with a series of hard and accurate shots. Cochet gradually developed his game, increasing his speed and often rushing to the net, causing Barnes to make mistakes. After several deuces, he won the game. Barnes made it 4-2 with a fierce smash against a deep high ball, then won Cochet's serve, with Cochet double-faulting to end the set. The referee asked the audience to be quiet. Cochet seemed to be flustered, but gradually recovered. Barnes won 6-2. Barnes often served cannonballs and then returned them, as he did against Tilden, but his errors were also numerous.</p>
<p>Men's Singles Quarterfinals: Cochet (left) loses to Barnes (right)</p>
<p>From the second set onwards, the surge gradually subsided. Barnes broke Cochet's serve first. In the next game, a shot by Cochet seemed to be out, but the umpire ruled in favor of Barnes. However, Barnes gave away the service game due to numerous errors. The failure of the serve spread like a plague, happening twice more afterwards. Cochet's opportunity was even better in the sixth game, forcing Barnes into errors and breaking his serve. His calm serve made it 5-2, and applause erupted. Although Barnes won the eighth game, he could not change the situation. At this time, Barnes showed his true fighting ability. Cochet took a 30-0 lead and needed two more points to win the set, but Barnes took advantage of Cochet's errors to win instead. He then won his next serve game, greatly changing the situation. This game was a long rally, with both sides fiercely hitting the other's backhand, but both were able to handle it with ease. Barnes won his next two serve games, and finally, Barnes also won Cochet's serve game without difficulty, first going 40-0, and then Cochet sending his ball into the net again. Barnes won the second set 8-6, making it 2-0. The applause was sparse and weak.</p>
<p>The third set was like a replay of the second. Cochet won Barnes' serve, making it 4-2. Barnes' errors were even more numerous than Cochet's. Cochet was able to answer incoming balls constantly, but could not sustain it. In the sixth game, Barnes failed with a double fault, and then Cochet won the serve to make it 5-2. After 5-3, Barnes resisted Cochet's serve, getting 30-0, 40-15, but ended up making numerous errors. Finally, Cochet won by touching the ball and crossing the net.</p>
<p>Barnes' brilliance gradually increased in the fourth set. After winning Cochet's serve at 3-1, the tide turned and the situation was set. Cochet was also improving, hitting the ball harder and faster, but Barnes answered with even harder balls, gradually attacking Cochet's entire line, adding pressure and forcing Cochet to succumb to this frenzy. With authoritative serves and shots, followed by deadly volleys at the net, Cochet succumbed at 6-1.</p>
<p>Barnes is not yet at his best, but is in the process of improving and recovering. He tends to make inexcusable errors too easily, and many winnable balls go out of bounds by inches. Cochet's tireless and unyielding fight is sometimes amazing, but his weakness is in losing his self-confidence and doubting his own decline. He makes more mistakes than Barnes. Barnes, on the contrary, is confident and not disturbed by his errors. Moreover, Barnes has gained the power to arbitrarily attack the enemy's nest.</p>
<p>Crawford was above Sato in every way, except for his weaker fourth set. Sato won the third set 6-2 after being down 5-0. The fourth set was even more fiercely contested, with the winner decided only in the last few minutes. Sato's last-ditch effort was well-timed, but Crawford's response was also remarkably clever. Sato made slightly more mistakes at the most intense moments.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the All-Shanghai Open Tennis Championships High and Junior Singles Tournament:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Wins McDonald in Straight Sets of Three</p>
<p>Sun Linfang and Smith's Victory is Undecided</p>
<p>Two Chinese Players in the Junior Group Are Eliminated</p>
<p>The All-Shanghai High and Junior Open Tennis Singles Tournament of the Lawn Tennis Association was originally scheduled to end on the 28th, but was repeatedly delayed due to rain and could not be held as scheduled. Corasa's five-set victory over Liang Deguang in the senior group has been reported in this newspaper. Recently, after defeating Chinese singles champion Wang Wenzheng in the Rotary Cup, Corasa's reputation has risen and his status has increased, and his hopes have also increased. In this second round of the senior singles, he will face Wang Wenzheng again, so Corasa has been practicing very hard recently. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, he specially arranged to practice with Qiu Feihai at the China Club until sunset before returning. At the same time, four groups of high and junior singles preliminary rounds were held at the China Club. Zheng Zhaojia eliminated American McDonald in straight sets of three. Sun Linfang and Smith fiercely competed in four sets, but the victory was undecided. The match was ended due to darkness and is scheduled to continue today. Two Chinese players, Li Nan and Mai Fengtang, were eliminated in the lower half of the junior group. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia's victory over McDonald was very easy. The match between Sun Linfang and Smith was very intense. The two started the earliest and ended the latest, creating a situation of two sets each in the fading twilight. Sun won the first and third sets, and lost the second and fourth sets. The match will continue at the China Club this afternoon. Sun's tennis skills have improved greatly. His biggest problem is that he is not good at running, which is a significant disadvantage.</p>
<p>In the junior group, Mai Fengtang of Datong University was eliminated by the mediocre West Bung due to insufficient experience and blind attacks, which is a pity. Li Nan's defeat to Forbes in straight sets of three was unexpected. Li has always been known for his steady and enduring style of play, but he was completely controlled by Forbes. Forbes lost to Sun Linfang in the second round last year, but his progress has been so rapid. Now, the only two Chinese players in the lower half of the junior singles have been eliminated. The only remaining ones are Guo Yujie and Chen Chuanzhang in the upper half, but the two will have to fight each other in the second round (both had byes in the preliminary round), and one of them must be eliminated. If this is the case, the junior singles championship, which has been regarded as a forbidden area by Chinese players since 1930-33, may not be retained this year.</p>

<p>Barnes and Hills' Team Also Failed and Were Eliminated in the All-American Doubles Tennis Semifinals</p>
<p>Hills and Parker Win in Five Sets</p>
<p>(Brockton, 28th Reuters) In the All-American Doubles Tennis Championships, in another team semi-final, Barnes and Grant Hills lost to Hills and Parker, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Hills and Parker will face the Australian team of Jo Bell and Quist in the final.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University's Summer Swimming Competition</p>
<p>Significant Improvement in Results</p>
<p>Jiaotong University holds a public swimming competition every summer, open to all students studying externally and those studying during the summer at the university. This year marks the fourth session, and the results have been excellent. The 400-meter freestyle broke the record of Jiangnan University. The preliminary rounds were held on the 28th, and the finals were held on the 29th, both starting at 3:00 PM. More than 400 people watched each day. After the competition, there was also a fish-catching competition, with the athletes going into the water to catch fish. The fish were exceptionally lively in the water, and even with good swimming skills, catching them barehanded was not easy, causing laughter to erupt. The event concluded at 5:00 PM, and prizes were awarded by President Hu, the chairman of the association. The top three in each event were awarded a bronze medal, and those who broke university records in five events were awarded a silver cup. The first three in the fish-catching competition, in addition to being allowed to keep the fish they caught, were also awarded a meal ticket. The results of each event are listed below: 50-meter freestyle: Yu Rongbang, Zhang Jinrong, 32 seconds; 100-meter freestyle: Yu Rongbang, Chen Ciqiao, 1 minute 17 seconds; 400-meter freestyle: Zhou Ruiqin, Gong Yibin, 7 minutes 6 seconds; 1500-meter freestyle: Yu Rongbang, Xu Zhenfang, 30 minutes 42 seconds 6; 100-meter backstroke: Zhou Ruiqin, She Bing, 1 minute 43 seconds 6; 200-meter breaststroke: Chen Hu, Yu Biru, 3 minutes 35 seconds 5; diving: Bao Xindi, Lu Xianqi, Gong Yibin.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University's gymnasium has a swimming pool with complete facilities, allowing Jiaotong athletes to practice fully, resulting in daily improvements in their results and the emergence of talent, such as Ling Chongju, Yu Rongbang, Zhong Langxuan, Chen Gengxin, Chen Hu, etc., who are all outstanding choices. Unfortunately, Ling Chongju, a major general in the 200-meter breaststroke, suddenly died of acute gastroenteritis last month. It is easy to recruit thousands of soldiers, but it is difficult to find one general. Those who heard the news lamented for Jiaotong University. Fortunately, Zhou Ruiqin, who recently came from Hong Kong, has a great deal of research in swimming. She has shown her skills in the Chinese preliminary rounds and in the China Youth Games. Jiaotong University's swimming talent can be said to be abundant. The opening of various schools is approaching, and the Jiangnan University Swimming Championships will also follow. It is expected that there will be a fierce competition with the Jinan athletes at that time.</p>

<p>Free Talk on Sympathy by Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>The best way to elicit people's praise and gain the pleasure of appearing to generously give without actually losing anything is through sympathy. This is because it is generally accepted that those who can sympathize are broad-minded individuals.</p>
<p>If someone is arrested for a certain ideology and faces the risk of losing their life, you can say to them: "Oh, you are truly great! You are willing to sacrifice everything for your ideology! I sympathize with you."</p>
<p>If you encounter someone who is selling their physical strength and knowledge at a low price, but has not yet sold their soul, you can say: "Although you may not be successful in the eyes of the world, your transcendence and unwillingness to compromise are undoubtedly admirable! I sympathize with you."</p>
<p>If they are someone who is willing to sell their physical strength, knowledge, and even their soul at a low price, but is still ignored and struggling between life and death, you can say without hesitation: "You are brave! You are fighting against adversity without regard for anything, and you will eventually find a new life! I sympathize with you."</p>
<p>You don't have to consider the other person's feelings or ask what kind of emotion they will have upon hearing your words. After receiving your sympathy, they may be grateful, angry, or contemptuous, or they may feel insulted. But that doesn't matter, that's their business. As for you, you are simply sympathizing broadly. If they have any unpleasant feelings, you can say that it's their misinterpretation.</p>
<p>In addition to expressing your broad-mindedness, sympathizing with others has an added benefit: it proves that your understanding is higher than theirs or that your circumstances are better.</p>
<p>Dog Talent Theory by Jun</p>
<p>"Better to be a dog in times of peace than a person in times of chaos."</p>
<p>Whenever social order is slightly disrupted, people often use these two sentences as a catchphrase. Seriously speaking, their focus is only on "peace" and "chaos," and they don't pay attention to "person" and "dog." In reality, if you still have human dignity, you will inevitably face persecution even in times of peace. As for dogs, they are always well-received and have no setbacks.</p>
<p>When the Qing Dynasty entered the pass, it was precisely the time when dogs were needed. They understood the psychology of dogs and knew that whips and clubs might lead to trapped beasts fighting back. The ingenious and labor-saving strategy was to win them over. Therefore, the former dynasty's surrendered officials retained their Ming Dynasty system, wore their hair up, and wore the crowns of virtuous men and long-sleeved robes, dividing into two classes with the Manchu ministers. The distinction between high-level dogs and ordinary dogs was clear, which not only deeply satisfied the psychology of ordinary dogs but also made management easier. A Shandong Jinshi named Sun Zhixie presumptuously wanted to imitate the high-level dogs, that is, the master-style clothing. He first shaved his head and wore a robe, thinking that the master would definitely look at him differently. He went to court and joined the Manchu class, but the high-level dogs did not agree. When he returned to the Han class, the ordinary dogs also despised him. In desperation, he submitted a memorial:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty has pacified China and renovated everything, but the system of clothing and hair-tying alone retains the old Han customs. This is Your Majesty following China, not China following Your Majesty."</p>
<p>This was naturally correct. Therefore, the head-shaving order was issued, and Sun Zhixie smoothly became the Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kong Wentiao, a "sage descendant" who was originally a prefect, still wanted to put on the airs of a "sage descendant" even after becoming a dog, trying to use his family's "former sage" banner to resist for a while. He also submitted a memorial saying:</p>
<p>"Of the great rites, none is more important than clothing and headwear. The sage's crown and gown have been guarded by his descendants for generations. Therefore, from the Han Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, although the system has been modified, only my family's clothing system has not been changed for three thousand years... Whether or not to keep hair and restore the clothing of our ancestors should be decided by the sage."</p>
<p>A dog actually had his own opinions. Where was the master's position? The result of the "sage's decision" was this:</p>
<p>"The strict order to shave hair, those who violate it will not be pardoned. Kong Wentiao's request to keep hair has already violated the unpardonable article. Considering that he is a sage descendant, he will be spared death. Moreover, if Confucius had violated the system in the time of the sage, it would have tarnished his ancestor's way of acting in accordance with the times. He is hereby dismissed and will never be reappointed."</p>
<p>This was truly deserved!</p>
<p>A dog, also known as a traitor, in other words, is the so-called outstanding person who does not betray "his ancestor's way of acting in accordance with the times." Any monarch who respects antiquity and writing will cultivate dog talents to work for himself. But sometimes they are also fooled, misunderstanding the functions of dog talents and easily changing the strategies that are intended to be good, legal, beautiful, and long-lasting. In the eighth month of the second year of the Qing Emperor Kangxi, there was such an imperial edict:</p>
<p>"The eight-legged essay is actually unrelated to political affairs. From now on, the decorative eight-legged essay will be permanently stopped. Only the question will be taken from the policy theory table for the benefit of the country and the people."</p>
<p>Using policy theory to select dog talents is naturally safe, but it is much worse than the eight-legged essay. In case you encounter an honest person who really wants to "benefit the country and the people" and comes up with some ideas, wouldn't that be extremely inappropriate? Therefore, in the eighth year of Kangxi, the Ministry of Rites requested to continue using the eight-legged essay to select scholars, and the "Benevolent Emperor Shengzu" suddenly realized that one law leads to all laws. In addition to restoring the eight-legged essay, he worshiped Confucius, personally went to release the sacrificial offerings, and ordered the Imperial College to study the theory of human nature, showing the Han people: opening the Bogxue Hongci branch, recruiting Junyi: opening the museum to compile the meeting code, dictionary, Ming History, Peiwun rhyme office and other books, as a model for scholars; touring Jiangnan, summoning and testing famous scholars to observe the human heart: opening the Millennium banquet, regardless of Manchu and Han officials and people, all those over the age of sixty-five can participate in the banquet to compose poems, to show the unity of Manchu and Han;... After a "gwaai gwaai long di dong" all of them were praised, and then they were followed by knives. Thus, the great cause of respecting antiquity and writing was accomplished, thus the great feat of cultivating dog talents was achieved, thus the eight sides praised virtue, and the world was peaceful!</p>
<p>Although China's history is long, the purpose of education seems to be consistent. The method of selecting scholars has not changed much since the Tang Dynasty. Many people hope to produce geniuses, and many people hope to produce talents, but in fact, these are all superfluous hopes: society needs dog talents. After creating a dog talent, they are still afraid that they will be unlucky and have no way out. What is there to talk about genius and talent!</p>
<p>Lion in an Iron Cage by Yiyun</p>
<p>Because of my admiration for the lion's reputation, I went to the Great World to see the lions. But when I walked to the iron cage, I was greatly disappointed! The lion was really not like a lion: its fur was falling out like a mange dog, its tail was hanging down, and it was pacing lazily, not even daring to look directly at the people outside the cage. The children outside the cage, while tugging at their parents' sleeves, shouted loudly at the lion in the cage, but no matter how hard they shouted, they could not arouse the lion's anger. Instead, the lion paced into the cage and lay down. The hair scattered on its head looked like a woman without makeup, making it look even more haggard and decadent. This lion disappointed me. I never thought that something that was called king and hegemon, whose roar was enough to shake mountains and make all beasts panic, would be so pathetic.</p>
<p>Recently, also because of my admiration for the lion's reputation, I went to the Municipal Zoo to see the lions. The lions there still had some semblance of lions, and their fur had not yet fallen out. When I saw it, it was perched on a fake rock, staring fiercely at the people, but without making a sound. The cage was much more sophisticated than the one at the Great World, with coarse iron bars on the outside and fine iron bars on the inside, only lacking shackles on the lion's feet. I came because of my admiration for the lion's name, so I stood outside the lion's cage for a long time. However, on that silent, majestic lion, I could not help but think that it looked like a large cat. The ingenious, agile, and fierce soul of the lion was nowhere to be found, although this lion was not as decadent and sluggish as the lion at the Great World. However, this zoo had just opened, and the lion had probably not been imprisoned for a long time, so it could still stare fiercely at the people, not yet to the point of hanging its tail and lying down in the cage.</p>
<p>I recently heard that a black bear in the zoo hugged the feeder when it was being fed, and the person almost lost his life. But I think this black bear was probably imprisoned not long ago, so it still had some wildness in it? As for the ones in Zhao Feng Park, they would definitely not do that. Don't they cleverly ask people for peanuts to eat?</p>
<p>Here, I feel the greatness of the power of imprisonment. Those arrogant and unruly big shots are often imprisoned for a long time, and after being imprisoned for some time, they will "change," probably for this reason.</p>
<p>June Day by Zhu Xunyuan</p>
<p>This is a June morning.</p>
<p>The sky is adorned with sparse morning stars, and a crescent moon still lingers in the west. A layer of gauze-like mist is scattered over the fields, making everything appear hazy and blurred. In this hazy and blurred light of dawn, there are many heads wearing straw hats, rising and falling in the green rice paddies.</p>
<p>Below each head is a hunched body; this body is almost completely submerged in the foul-smelling, sticky mud. Each hand, smeared with mud, grabs around the rice roots, pulling out the weeds that are eroding the rice. The firm muscles on the arms stretch and contract faintly in the mud. This is a force, a power.</p>
<p>The knees kneel in the slippery mud, as if sinking into a bottomless abyss; slowly, slowly sinking down, all the way to the crotch. After a while, the knees move forward, sinking into another abyss. Muddy water splashes up, splashing onto everyone's eyebrows and lips.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a few knees land on sharp rice roots, and red blood and black mud immediately mix and flow; but they still have to endure, struggle, and work.</p>
<p>The glistening dewdrops on the rice leaves soak everyone's clothes; the sharp edges of the rice leaves scratch or tear the skin of each person. The floating dust emits a humming sound, forming clumps like dust that fly and spin over everyone's heads, and then gather to rest on everyone's faces and necks, sucking and emitting an unbearable itch; but they still have to endure, struggle, and work.</p>
<p>At noon, there is not a trace of wind, a few thin clouds float in the azure sky, and the poisonous sunlight shines directly on the vast fields. The intense heat is mixed in the air, exerting the power of high summer. At this time, the rice seedlings gasp for breath in the field without oil; the ridges of the fields are dry, white, and hard, bursting with cracks; the water in the fields is bubbling, scalding and unable to rest the feet.</p>
<p>The backs of each person are scorched by the hot sunlight, and large drops of sweat evaporate from the charred black skin, congealing into one piece, flowing down like a waterfall from their backs and faces. The steam from the fields, mixed with pig ash, mud, and heat, rises fiercely, rushing into everyone's nostrils, making it impossible for people to breathe. The fingers wearing the finger baskets (Note: used when weeding rice, woven from bamboo, worn on the fingers, making it easier to pull weeds.) are sore and tired and cannot be stretched and bent; the hunched waists and backs are numb and cannot move. Everyone has a feeling; they feel that their bodies will be melted by this scorching sunlight. Although they all have this feeling, they still have to endure, struggle, and work in the fiery sunlight.</p>
<p>Endure! Struggle! Work! But they are still eking out a living in hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Women (6) by Shen Congwen</p>
<p>But where are such farmers to be found? All the farmers are mostly starved to death. Here, there is only a stretch of sand in front of them, a stretch of sea. The nation is aging, and the barbaric things done out of instinct will no longer happen. What circulates in the city is only the spreading of rumors and slanders for small gains, and the assassinations and enticements for slightly larger gains. Love is just like a castrated chicken, playing the clown comedy everywhere.</p>
<p>She thought about more than ten clowns, reviewing the various inappropriate loves of these sentimental men, and unpleasant impressions. She walked, repeatedly thinking about the pastor's son she had never met. This man, an eighteen-year-old girl, only wanted to commit suicide for him, a proud person! A meteor, she thought, even if she rode this meteor, she should find this man and see how his pride disappears into gentle, elegant, considerate, and kind friendship and responses. She remembered the meteor she saw earlier.</p>
<p>The sunlight came out, burning half the sky red. The sea was a silver expanse, enveloped in a thin mist.</p>
<p>The early sun was dissolving this thin mist. The clear breeze blew on people's sleeves like the beginning of autumn.</p>
<p>The thin mist gradually dissolved, and the waves on the sea were dazzling, like a flat layer of mercury, impossible to look at directly.</p>
<p>The dazzling sea needs sunlight, and the dazzling life also needs something akin to sunlight. Since this thing is not easy to find in young gentlemen, one should pay attention to another place!</p>
<p>On the day of the gathering, there should have been a drama in which she starred. When the time was approaching, she could not be found anywhere. Some people suspected that something might have happened to her by the sea, but there was no sign of it by the sea. Then someone made a ridiculous guess, saying that she might have left, left here, so they went to search her small tent that she occupied alone. Although some simple luggage was still in the tent, there was a small note posted on the support column, saying only: "I am not happy to be here anymore, I am leaving, everyone should have a happy holiday." Everyone realized that this person had truly left.</p>
<p>Like a meteor, although the meteor has long passed away, it left a dazzling mark in everyone's heart. That incident became the center of discussion for a group of people at that summer gathering, but no one understood why this beautiful and outstanding woman suddenly left alone.</p>
<p>The sun rises from the east, so she paid attention to the east, and took a French postal ship to the eastern coast. She wanted to find something that would make her shine with vitality and also shine itself. She arrived at another seaside in the East belonging to the northern country.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of people from all places, American sailors who had lived in Nanyang for a long time and had the smell of coconuts, three-island Japanese people wearing wide clothes, Northern Russians who were displaced in foreign countries, huge-bellied merchants and politicians running from all parts of the country, and...</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance: Decline in Speed, Bullion Closes Slightly Better by One Yuan</p>
<p>Silver Futures and Exchange Rates Plunge, Opening High in the Morning</p>
<p>Overseas News Deteriorates, Followed by a Sharp Decline</p>
<p>The gold market rose sharply yesterday, but then fell again significantly. This was due to the decline in silver prices in both England and the United States. The English pound depreciated by 9.25 points against the US dollar, and the US dollar depreciated sharply by 12.25 points against the English pound. On the Five Metals Exchange, the forward silver price fell by 1.88 points. The private telegraph silver price was slightly lower at 8.75. American cotton fell slightly by 8 pounds, and American wheat fell by 1.625 points. Stocks also fell.</p>
<p>The wool market opened with a sharp jump, then rose to over 60 yuan (but the goods were about 10 yuan lower than the price). The Guangdong merchants sold heavily, and other large clients also supplied vigorously. One cloud then plummeted by 10 yuan. After opening, the market trended looser, continuing to decline. This was because Reuters reported that the US Secretary of Agriculture officially announced a 15% reduction in wheat fields. Although there were many struggles afterwards, people's hearts were tired, and it was difficult to see a strong recovery. Afterwards, Reuters reported that the French financial authorities were closely watching the decline in English and American currency prices, and the danger to the franc could occur at any time. It was also said that the final crisis of the franc was not far away. Traders then sold francs, and the market further declined at noon. Later, although the exchange rate was still strong, it broke the 40 yuan barrier because many shorts were liquidated. Finally, it remained within the 40 yuan barrier. The cash price increased by 235 yuan.</p>
<p>The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 850.5 yuan, an increase of 12.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened</p>

Now that the headquarters had been completed, the central task for the future, based on the requirements of the situation and the status of the highest institution of learning, was for all alumni to unite, promote scholarship, and use the collective strength and wisdom of all alumni to serve society and further transform society, so as not to let down the country, which spends huge sums of money each year to cultivate them.

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Expresses Its Opinion on the Shanghai Municipal Council's Allocation of Subsidies to Private Schools</h3>
<p>Regarding Subsidies for Schools Along Extra-Settlement Roads and Unregistered Schools</p>
<p>Education Bureau Disagrees Due to Infringement on Sovereignty and Conflict with Regulations</p>
<p>Shanghai News reports that the Shanghai Xinbao reprinted a message from the Da Mei Evening News on the 22nd of this month, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council is preparing to allocate subsidies, and schools along extra-settlement roads are also eligible for subsidies, and unregistered schools can directly apply for subsidies to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Education Bureau believes that the above two points infringe on our sovereignty, damage the spirit of cooperation at the time, and conflict with important articles of the regulations established by the Shanghai Municipal Council over the years, and cannot agree to them. It is heard that it has informed the Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In addition, the bureau's subsidy application form is scheduled to be issued from the 28th of this month to the 5th of next month, as reported in the previous newspaper. Because each school needs four copies of this form, and only one type of form has been issued, all schools feel inconvenient and have requested that it be printed uniformly to save procedures. It is heard that the bureau has agreed to the request and ordered the printing house to rush to print it, which should be completed by this Saturday.</p>
