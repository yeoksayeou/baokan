<h3>日本空防缺點</h3>
<p>軍部因恐市民厭戰隠蔽眞相　　日軍全力尙難保護四大地方（華聯社東京通信）關東大防空演習、其參加地方共有一府四縣、包含一千餘萬之人、七大重要城鎭、其意義甚重大、自八月九日上午八時起至十一日上午六時停戰、前後三日間、所費金錢與人力甚巨、而軍部僅誇稱其成功、尙未發表其眞相、據軍界所傳消息、此次之演習、確予好戰主義者之大脅威、其理由如左、</p>
<p>㈠此次進攻東京市及關東各重要地方之敵機僅五十架、而防守者即以陸軍航空三大隊之精銳空軍、且調動全　之高射砲隊·聽音隊·照空隊·電信隊·野砲隊等、全國出動之特科兵已達一萬七千人、爲維持治安而參加之陸軍則達七師團、如一旦開戰、阪神之軍事地帶、北九州之軍事地帶、廣島之大本營及動員軍隊起落地點等、所需之防空人員則要今次之四倍、以全陸軍之特科兵尙不足守、何况欲遠征於西伯利亞之大戰塲、如此則驅國民於死地、日陸軍極隠蔽此種可怕之事實、</p>
<p>㈡在此演習中、共產黨之反戰隊、割斷其軍用電線、前後二十數次、在大震災時、因謠傳韓人投毒於井中，遂　生全市韓人之慘案、市民大起恐慌、如果戰爭則反戰者不但韓人、連其同胞之共產黨亦當乘機蹶起、其慘狀更不堪設想、市民見人皆敵、草木皆兵、在此恐怖情形下、雖萬兵不能提防此種謠言及反戰運動、</p>
<p>㈢東京周圍之交通橋頗多、一旦被炸斷、則五百萬市民、一瞬間就會爲飢荒而暴動、</p>
<p>㈣如天候陰雲罩天、則防空隊亦難盡其防空之職、</p>
<p>㈤東京市井少、如一旦自來水池被投彈或投毒、則容易起紛亂、而且水管埋地甚淺、容易炸燬、水管燬後、則救火亦不可能、加之日本之房屋、一枝自來火亦容易縱火、故日本防空、比較世界任何都市、更加困難、</p>
<p>日軍部因恐市民知其眞相而起厭戰、對此種欠點則隠蔽甚力、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>移監犯屯墾明</h3>
<p>新疆內部糾紛。自經中央特派專使前往宣慰之後。劉盛二氏。似已有相當之布置。在體上或可暫告段落。惟新省地處邊。陲論其形勢。由西北以至西南。皆具極其複雜之國際關係。處置一有不當。非特足以引起地方上漢回之糾紛。且亦足以遺誤國家大計。而交通不便人口稀少。尤爲新省根本之缺陷。頃者外長兼法長羅文幹。奉命巡視新疆除一般視察之外。復主開闢交通。其間尤重要而爲民國以來之創舉者。則移壯年監犯以開邊屯墾是也。近世處置犯罪者之主旨。不外三端。一爲報復主義。二爲感化主義。三爲隔離主義。蓋「殺人者死。傷人及盜者抵罪。」自古已然。國家代行人民之公意。不令一般社會强者橫行。弱者被欺。故用法以齊一之。不過報復主義過於狹小。且非求治之根本原則。於是感化之說。較報復爲切合於實際。又適於公共之要求。然而社會日形複雜。人與人間之關係愈見繁密。不良環境之引誘。强於道德仁義之勸導。而感化之效力微。乃遂由感化而採取隔離主義。使彼兇頑者。脫離一般社會關係。以求保持社會上善良狀態。但在近日生活窘迫之狀態下。相率挺而走險。不惜破壞一切法律以圖一逞者又日見其多。則隔離亦將不勝其隔。而立法之用意窮矣。</p>
<p>夫法治之力。僅能使長厚者謹守凖繩。不敢輕於逾越設使一旦爲飢寒驅迫。加以環境之剌激。慾望之煽動。則彼輩豈復有所畏懼殺且不足以止亂監禁隔離。寗尙有所顧忌哉。在昔農業社會中。最高之理想以爲「不患寡而患不均。不患貧而患不安。」故先就「均」與「安」以求致治况今日不安不均之象。何止十百倍於往昔而欲以感化隔離。求收效於法律之警戒亦戞戞乎難之矣。今者移監犯以開邊屯墾之議。正可以濟法律之窮而開邊屯墾亦即爲求均求安之本。一舉兩得。非其他迂遠之談所可比擬也</p>
<p>此移犯開屯之議。一面旣爲壅塞不通之監獄開一出路一面又給衆罪犯以自新之途。同時但知坐食而毫無所補益於社會者亦得盡力於公衆之機會。英國之開發澳洲也。固曾用此法而今澳洲。已成爲世界所欣羨之新國矣歐洲各强國。如英。如法。如西。如葡。對於酷熱之非洲。莫不感開發之困難。近亦漸使用罪犯。以從事此未來之新路。蘇聯之開鑿波羅地海與白海間之運河。在冰天雪地中挖地二二七公里。溝通波羅地海與北氷洋間之交通。亦大部爲囚人之力。且此舉於實際工作效能外。亦得收感化隔離之功。故吾人深願此議之能見諸實施也。</p>

<h3>西報述日本航空事業</h3>
<p>飛機之效用、及其在今後戰爭中之地位、自九一八以來、業已充分顯明、顧日本航空事業之發展、亦不過近十餘年間事、祗以朝野之熱心提倡、突飛猛進、而有今日之成績、惟目下日本之軍用商用航空事業、究已進展至何種地步、及其所以致此之原因、値此航空救國時期、諒不僅爲國人之所亟欲知、當亦大有可資吾輩借鏡者在、字林西報十日東京通訊、述日本航空事業之發展及其研究精進之情形綦詳、特譯之如次、</p>
<p>據云、「日本之注意航空、爲時猶暫、當奥佛爾兄弟與白萊利奥及英國諸先進試騐飛機之際、日人尙無意於追踵、以爲静觀其結果、於願已足、直至一九一零年始第一次試飛成功、時有德川上尉、偕另一軍官、派往法國學習航空術、遂自法國購歸五十匹馬力飛機一架、在天空飛行近兩哩之遥、博得國人之稱譽、其時西方諸國早已作遠距離飛行、甚致有爲橫渡大西洋之嘗試者、吾人於此、又有可注意者、歐戰以前、德國在軍事設備、雖以最新顚見稱於世、而日人在戰前却未嘗一往德國學習航空、惟自德川試演成功後、日軍人確覩此新式武器在戰爭中之潛勢、遂起航空活動之狂熱、於Ｔokoroznwa設置陸軍飛機塲、於橫須賀兵工廠附近設海軍航空港、然直至歐戰之中、始能使日本設置空軍、而謀長足之進展、</p>
<p>一九一四年以前、日本所用飛機與馬達、絶對賴歐美供給、迨戰事入第二三年、歐洲需用飛機甚殷、斷絶輸出、於是日人遂謀自造、將前此購自歐美者、分拆倣造、其時所造馬達、雖運用不甚佳妙、但裝成飛機、尙能飛行、及歐戰告終、飛機復得自國外輸入、但日人决意力圖軍用品之自給、研究益力、按其時日人　視飛機、除作戰具外、固猶未想及他種　途者也、當時日本飛機製造公司之第一目的、在購得歐洲所用之圖樣、遂有德荷兩國公司首先售以圖樣、並派技術人員至日恊助製造裝配、嗣於一九一九年日軍部復請法參謀部派航空專員至日指導訓練、繼以日海軍邀請英國海軍練訓官、助其訓練海軍航空隊、</p>
<p>同時日人亦開始注意商用航空、日政府旣努力奬勵、予以優厚之津貼、日新聞界復努力提倡民用航空、不僅盡鼓吹宣傳之能事、且身自爲倡、東京大阪各大報幾無不自置飛機、常用以攝取照片、及傳達消息、宣揚其效用、例如一九二三年大地震之後、東京與各地交通斷絶、各報飛機莫不從事報告、及其他有用工作、每日與朝日報知與時事之四報、對此航空、並有猛烈之競爭、朝日新聞之兩機、曾於一九二五年自東京、取道西伯利亞而達羅馬、報知新聞曾兩次企圖飛越太平洋、惜未成功、</p>
<p>至于今日、日本空軍已成一强有力之軍隊、自滿洲事件發生、全國上下之航空熱、更與日俱增、各大都市之天空飛機、往來不絶、報紙中、月台上、影戲片內、甚致宣敎壇前、亦莫不見狂熱之宣傳、總計日本今日製造飛機及其附件之廠、已在三十家以上、當滬戰之時、及此後數月間、此等工廠、聞有日夜開工趕造者、</p>
<p>三菱公司在名古屋之飛機製造廠、佔地之廣、達五十九英畝、僱用工人、逾三千名、其規模之大、可以槪見、今日日本之飛機廠、漸漸注其全力於日機之製造、而所造者、多屬追逐機與戰鬭機、至於偵察機、則工事尙未臻完善云、惟日本飛機製造公司、今莫不儘力製造「戰機」、其中數架、乃倣外國式造成、業經用於滿洲矣、雖軍事當局覺此種飛機徒可供滿洲行軍之用、蓋飛機之在該地、可橫行無忌、即遭抵抗、亦甚弱也、淞滬戰時、用以轟擊閘北之飛機、其中固多購諸外國者　、而亦有係此間二三大飛機廠倣外國式由陸軍省直接監造以成者、此多少已爲公開之秘密矣、在日探訪關於飛機製造之尋常事實、或關於天空防務之事件、實不可能、當爾有所問詢、答者極形謙和、而轉瞬之間、忽呑吐其詞、表示其不能英語然、但在數分鐘前猶以流利之英語與爾周旋此由於恐人探其秘密、、故佯作此狀耳、日本商營航空事業、多在日本航空運輸公司掌握、自開辦以來、不特成績卓著、且足　美任何各國、該公司經營自東京取道大阪至福　（日本南部）之定期飛航、並經過大連、展至朝鮮、自「滿洲國」成立後、日本由是得享廣大之便利、故此航空線更展至哈爾濱、並取道滿洲主要各城、而達齊齊哈爾、滿洲線有時名爲日滿航空公司、其實乃日本舊有航空運輸公司推廣之營業耳、日本今日之陸海軍務因空中戰器之大加擴張、而呈蓬勃之象、陸軍與海軍皆認日本空軍遜於英美兩國、海軍界尤嘵不已、謂日本之海軍比率、旣小於其需要、而軍縮會議復拒絶日本所持飛機母艦爲防衛利器之見解、故日本之設較大空軍、實爲急不容緩之舉云、日本今日究有商用軍用飛機若干架、殊難得其確數、姑加猜度、其數當在九百架左右也、</p>
<p>九一八案發生後、事變疊興、戰爭狂熱、風靡全國於是民衆募捐購機、以助陸軍、號爲愛國飛機、其中有偵探機·輕炸彈機·救傷機等、計由富户或公共捐欵購助陸軍之機、約在百架左右、而泰半用於滿洲、此種愛國機、每架命　　際、輒有多數民衆舉行盛大之宗敎典禮、東京今日有甚大之研究航空術之機關、據傳其規摸之大、設置之精、堪爲世界之冠、該研究所佔地十四英畝、有特别構造之空氣隧道、及其他貴重之設備、其目的何在、似無人知之、但敢謂其最後主旨、乃欲使日本航空事業之科學探討、不倚賴泰西耳、日本期望發明水上飛機、該研究所之殷、　欲於航空有所發明、日本嘗自　當　聲鳴時、從不乏英　之　　、此種自　　、他國亦　作之、大熱情　　造就英雄第不知機械之發明、熱情庸有　乎</p>

<h3>德總領事否認接恐嚇信</h3>
<p>謠　原因純由誤會</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨日本埠方面忽盛傳代理德總領事白蘭德接有共產或反對希特勒派之恐嚇信、但據白總領事昨夜告記者、並無此事、即該署中人亦未嘗有接到此類信函者、又當昨日此說盛傳時、甚致謂、領事署曾有巡捕環駐保護、旋經捕房加以否認、現信此項謠　、殆因反戰會議代表抵滬時、捕房爲防杜發生游行示威情事、加派探捕巡邏招商局中棧碼頭附近、無識者遂誤爲保護德總領事署以致訛言繁興云、</p>
<h3>市商會發表對合夥制度主張</h3>

<h3>絲價低落後絲廠業公會昨開大會</h3>
<p>仿照南市區辦法改用產兩制　原則通過辦法俟擬訂後討論本市絲廠業前以絲市稍好、多抛趕工、今遇期貨交卸、因市價低落、每　貨身挑剔、加以職工　遇、自經社會局調解恢復、以致損失甚鉅、維持困難、閘北區各廠要求同業公會提交大會、公决救濟辦法、該公會於昨日下午四時、特在北山西路會所、本行會員大會、到各廠代表張偑紳等五十餘人、　由沈驊臣主席、茲誌詳情如下</p>
<h3>外商爲難</h3>
<p>本年絲業狀况、當春季　繭汛上市之際、海外去　路頗示活　、故市價亦漸見上趨之勢、故各廠在收春繭時、莫不認爲本年絲市、當不致再跌、尤以美國放棄金本位之故、而所存希望益堅、　兩月以來、絲價仍復疲弱、市價亦不過八百元左右、但各廠因春季收貨甚多、爲免損拆息及維持廠內職員等生活計、皆照常開放、勉力支持、惟最近各廠在各外商抛出期貨、每受外商挪移、所受損失、頗屬不小、蓋各廠抛售期貨、原爲市價稍好、故不惜多抛趕工、惟近來每遇期貨交卸、因市價低落、輒以貨身挑剔、强抑原價、設廠商稍與爭議、則將期貨完全劃云、不予收受、致廠商因迫於環境、忍痛交割、明受虧損、</p>
<h3>酌减工資</h3>

<h3>戰爭與和平</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>達爾文的進化論，不過說，世界上的生物，都是由下等的進化而成的。近世的考古家，充極其量，也只會到蒙古，埃及，以及、小亞細亞等地去掘出幾個骷髏來，發表一下古代人類的腦袋，比了近代人的大幾倍而已。這些不可一世的大科學家，眞是一明察秋毫，不見輿薪，」他們想不到說一句「一九三三年的人類最聰明。」</p>
<p>古時候，大家詛咒着戰爭，說，「兵凶戰危」。威爾遜總統總算聰明不過的了，發明了「爲正義而戰」的口號，總算掩蓋了些兒「戰爭的罪惡」，但是大戰終止之後，大家摸着瘡痂，仍是搖頭嘆息，有苦没處說，最膾炙人口的「西線無戰事」，已十足地表現着「兵凶戰危」，於是乎組織國際聯盟，大吹大擂的「維持世界和平。」</p>
<p>但是到了一九三三年，人類的聰明，大有進步。紙老虎式的國際聯盟，有甚麽用，一脚踢倒了，乾脆。但是「兵凶戰危」，世界需要「和平」，於是各自關了大門幹和平工作。日本爲了要保「東亞和平」，不得不侵略中國的東四省，組織僞國。美國爲了要保「太平洋和平」，不得不建造三十二條兵艦，以維持五五三的比率。德國爲了要保「歐洲和平」，不得不向匈奥法波挑釁。俄國爲了要維持「世界和平」，更不能不努力擴展紅軍的實力。</p>
<p>這些那些，誰不是在準備第二次的世界大厮殺，但是，誰不是豎起了「和平」的大幌子。爲和平而備戰，呌做「武裝和平」，多麽漂亮。由「武裝和平」，進一步而不和平了，那麽雖已榮爲「戎首」，兀是好「爲和平而戰」的喊得震天價響。明明是「兵凶戰危」，放上了幾響「和平烟」</p>
<p>幕彈」，甚麽都是挺有理的了。所以我說「一九三三年的人類最聰明」。</p>
<h3>初秋</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>早上起來，穿着單衣覺得點兒冷，於是從衣櫃中拿出一件綫衣來，加在身上倒也不覺得熱。</p>
<p>昨夜蟋蟀在窗前呌得怪響的，那聲音好像得意的人在高歌一樣，我因爲貪聽了喞喞的蟲聲，遲到月影離開我小室的時候，我才入了夢境！</p>
<p>照例放了一缸冷水沐浴，剛踏進去渾身却都起了寒慄，免强洗完，皮膚感覺到有點不大舒快。心裏兀自在想，後天不預備踐赴友人邀去游泳的約了。</p>
<p>電風扇孤寂的躺在屋角，它的輪齒停滯着不見活動，在過去它對於人雖然</p>
<p>有一度好感，現在它却成爲一個落伍者了！它將要被人遺棄了。</p>
<p>一年容易：過去了一個活潑秀麗的春天，又過去了一個如火如茶的夏天，現在是蕭瑟的秋天到了，不久還要經過一個冷酷的冬天，這樣！人的心裏不免感覺到悲傷。但事實告訴我們，時令是不時向前推轉着的，過了這個秋天，冬天，春天不是又要和我們再見嗎？我們希望春天的來臨，我們在這蕭瑟的季候，是要如何努力的生活下去喲！</p>
<h3>漫話漫畫</h3>
<p>— 錢澐作文棟良作畫</p>
<p>家庭敎育如此！某太太，稱讚自已兒子說：</p>
<p>昨天我的手氣不和，四圈和一副，誰知他一代，就來了個四翻，一萬九萬和倒，三十六，七十二，一百四十四，二百：：：孩子也隨着這話更其高興；據說媽媽後來　因此給了他十個銅元。</p>
<p>吃罷飯，没有事，没有事三字，彷彿每日的事；於是三好　，亭子間嫂嫂，隔壁奶奶，張先生，檯子撮開，仍是八圈，時候早再來四圈莊，反正，這樣困人天氣，出外幹麽！孩子同般無聊，搶着桌子角，看可有中風，發財成對，若說這是大人們的敎育，有如說爸爸媽媽的催殘兒童聖潔之心！</p>
<p>家庭敎育而到了如此地步，眞是傷心不過；令人簡直無話可說！</p>
<h3>求業碰壁記</h3>

<p>此路不通，向後轉，走！</p>
<p>踏入ＸＸ公司，求見經理，呈上文憑，說明來意，側耳傾聽，心頭鹿跳，高肚皮的經理蹙着眉說：市况蕭條，營業淸淡，小號連年虧折，外强中乾，先生大材容後敦聘！</p>
<p>此路又不通，再向後轉，走！</p>
<p>走進ＸＸ學校。會晤校長。呈上文憑。說明來意，嚅囁以請，面紅耳赤，校長哭喪着臉道：不暪老兄說，這個年頭裏，坐冷板凳的，眞比夏天裏的蒼蠅還要多：敝校早告客滿，還請老兄另走别路！雖然對不起，實在也没法。到處碰壁，焦頭爛額，滿腹熱望，冰冷氣出·校門八字開，有志無錢莫進來，大學當然進不得·經濟崩潰，豐收成災，農村更加歸不得，没有力氣，街車拉不得，顏皮欠厚，地狀告不得，於是小子只好揑了一張廢紙！文憑，廢然而返·鑽進亭子間，準備好肚子，吃家鄉老米飯，修家庭大學的學位·</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十三回　棄職見知音佳人默許　承家得來者健兒狂歡趙翁一擺手道：我的話還没有說完啦！我那孩子，倒也没有和我說過一個不字。可是到了近來，他常是說軍隊裏怎樣苦，出頭又怎樣不易，再讓上次害病的那個兵士來一說苦經，我也就心灰一半啦。咱們揭開來說話，老太，你疼你的姑娘，我也疼我的兒子，誰不願意兒女雙雙的，總擺在眼面前我很樂意和你商量着辦。假使你覺得孩子不必當這分差事了，我想着，自已去找老東家，總也可以和他找一分事情。雖然錢是要掙得少一點，倒也是分長久的事。江氏道：這都見得老太爺，看得起我們，好在日子很長，將來我們就慢慢的再說罷。趙翁將酒杯一推，忽然站起來道：老太太，你别忙，我找點東西你來看看。說畢，他回轉身就走了。江氏看他這個情形，却也有些莫明其妙，他有什麽東西拿給我着呢？趙翁走進屋子去，約莫有上十分鐘，手上捧了一大捲紙包，拿了出來，放在桌子角上，用手在上面輕輕一按，笑道：老太，你瞧，這是我們祖上，給孩子留的。說着，將紙包打開，裏面乃是一包田地契紙，他將手輕輕的拍了幾下道：這裏面都是保定老家的地契，有個二三十畝的，只因我年老力衰，自已種不了地，只好租給别人了。我那孩子若是不幹差事的話，回家去種地，凑付着總也能過喝粥的日子。我只要有個好兒媳，我這大歲數，還當什麽家，都請你們姑娘接過去了。老太，並不是我想攀這門親，今天我就把這些好話來騙你。一個人家，只要家庭和美，就是每日吃兩餐小米粥，也是舒服的（一六四）</p>

<p>公園的椅子，鐵梗上飾顏色漆，和繩穿的，或草編的坐椅，是公園中的最摩登的東西。</p>
<p>在會客室裏，四周所有白的墻壁上，最時行的裝飾物，便是兩株栗色的樹，自樹幹到樹頂，也用白粉描繪。</p>

<p>一面不碎玻璃的鏡子，裏面有一個鏡製的圓圈，插着一把鮮花，是妝臺上一種新的裝飾品。</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>簡易的美容術</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>女子的臉龐，伊是最愛惜的，　每天總要對着鏡子照好多次，又時時擦粉。現在市上擦臉的粉，內中含有少量的鉛質，鉛之有害於皮膚，這是人人所知道的。但是最上等的香粉，用炭酸鈣和香精製成的，特地把價定得很貴，表示　是上等的粉，這種粉只有資產階級的婦女喜　。</p>
<p>今天有幾個平民化的美容方法把　寫出來，貢獻於愛惜臉龐的婦女。每天臨睡的時候，如果在臉頰上擦些鷄子淸過夜，次日早上仍把　洗去，一月之後，臉上的皮膚會光緻細膩的。又一法：每日淸晨未先臉前可用人乳塗面，待乾後再洗去！或用荳亂代替亦可。這三個方法，曾由許多女子試用，連續一月之久，都生了效騐。油光，黯𠳨，雀斑，都能漸漸的减退，只要有恒心，不可中輟。</p>
<p>我們這地方，有許多温州婦人，伊們喜用山芋，就是山薯，天天切一薄片，向臉上細察，等到山芋滲出的乳白汁擦完了，再用水洗臉伊們天天這樣用，不擦粉，臉上倒也很好，很光緻，據說山芋有漂白皮膚之功呢。</p>
<h3>乳與嬰兒</h3>
<p>— 楊素珍華文英醫生</p>
<p>哺乳之適當時間、哺乳無定時，爲普通習慣，有時過量則太飽，有時不及則飢餓，消化器失去調節，嬰兒衰弱及不眠等病因之發生。故哺乳不論所哺爲人乳或代乳品，宜有相當規定時間。產後一二日內乳汁稀少，嬰兒每日吮四五回，三日後乳汁潮湧，卽應有時間規定，通常產後六週，每隔二小時哺乳一次，每日自早晨六時開始，至晚十時爲止，共哺八次爲最相宜，晚間十時以後，至翌晨五時之間，不宜授乳，嬰兒經此規定訓練後，每以畫醒夜眠，腦神筋消分器均得充分的休養。</p>
<p>代乳品之使用　牛乳之不適用於代乳品，其因甚多，其味過淡，其汁過濃，不合嬰兒口味，且當暑天，細菌容易滋生，頗爲危險，故在育嬰實騐上，人造代乳品遂應運而生。近來市上流行之勒吐精惠民奶粉，其主要成分仍爲牛奶，但一經調製、遂爲極佳之滋養品，然較人乳終稍遜色。大槪嬰兒最好至四五月後胃力稍强，哺以代乳品爲相宜，預備代乳品，應置下列各物：小鉛鍋，玻璃杯，小匙瓢，小煤油爐，乳瓶，乳頭，洗瓶刷，蘇打水，及硼酸溶液，將上列各物置於一處，用白布或紗罩蓋罩。然後依照代乳品仿單所指定，和以適量之水，加熱至一定温度，如嬰兒病時，水分加多，以不妨消化爲度。又代乳品預備一次，而有餘剩，不可温熱之以待第二回之用。哺乳瓶外刻度數分量者爲佳，用畢卽宜洗凈。乳頭之淸潔不可忽略，每晨將乳頭置硼酸液中沸煮數分鐘，每次用後，必須拭乾。更當注意之一點，乳頭應隨時察看，有無雜物在內，倘有存留，卽用洗瓶刷除去，可免嬰兒口痛及排洩物稀簿等症也。</p>
<p>斷乳之步驟　通常過一週歲又五六月，可以完全斷乳，斷乳最良之支配，可分爲二時期：第一時期斷人乳，第二時期斷代乳品。大槪乳母覺乳汁漸漸减少時，可用代乳品以調節之，一方面人乳量减，一方面代乳量增，此爲最良之斷乳步驟。每見人家一旦乳傭停職他去，乳源遂絶，代乳品非嬰兒素嗜，號哭不食，疾病隨之。所以嬰兒於產後四五月最好每日間以代乳品哺之，使能吮乳瓶，並慣於代乳品，以爲斷乳之準備，又斷乳不可於夏季行之，嬰兒身體不適時，亦不可斷乳。（却酬）</p>

<h3>焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷（續）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>更有對於社會衛生的影響，也是非常重大。因爲社會衛生的改善和建設，差不多完全是靠着醫事統計做標準，但是醫事統計，差不多完全是靠着實地醫家的報告，報告有價値没有價値，是完全靠着診察精確不精確。若是診察不精確，他的報告，當然也不精確，統計的成績，當然也不正確，那末重要疾病在社會上流行消長的眞面目，和社會制度習慣等對於疾病的影響，完全無從確切測知，結果，社會衛生的政策方案，完全無從依據而確定了。譬如結核病，若是一天一天地多起來，社會的整個活動力，就一天一天地衰退起來，社會的耗費，就一天一天地增加起來，這是結核病對於社會的影響，所以結核這個病，是成了非常重大的社會問題。翻轉來看，社會的制度習慣，對於結核病的影響，也是非常重大，那一種職業，害結核病的人最多，營養的關係是怎樣，經濟的關係是怎樣，一年之中，什麽時期發病率最多，什麽時期死亡率最多，什麽時期增惡最多，什麽時期欬血最多，而且這幾個最多時期，或最少時期，對於空氣温度的變化，新上時的飲食物，特别發生的事故，以及其他的流行病等等，有無一定的關係，此外還有男女性别關係，年齡老少的關係，若是能有精確的調查，會合統計起來，那末社會現象對於結核病的影響，就可以明顯出來。於是乎那幾件制度應該改良，那幾件習慣應該矯正，那幾件事項應該禁絶，一件件都可以在統計上明白告訴我們。然後衛生行政的進展，有路可以走了。即此，可以見得調查統計，對於民衆健康的重要性，是有非常的價値。若是診察不精確，那就絶對不能利用這個虚僞的統計，并且依着這種虚僞的統計，還要認錯了目標，走錯了路，弄得如水益深，如火益熱。總而言之，診察不精確，病家個人受虚僞的治療，是不秘說，對於醫學自身的發展，也有莫大阻礙，對於民衆衛生的前途，也有非常危險，只此一端，國醫的罪孽，似乎已經深重得十二分了。</p>
<p>第四件消毒嚴密：這件事，對於生命的關係，對於時疫蔓延，傳染病展開的關係，其重要性，人人都可澈底明白，不必細說了。</p>
<p>焦先生說：「西醫的：：短處，是機械觀念太甚，在西醫的眼光中，差不多是目無全人，西醫因爲有這種觀念，勢必至於頭痛救頭，脚痛救脚，國醫對於許多內部腫瘍，比如肺癰腸癰一類症候，很可以具體的服用湯藥，把他治好，西醫只就局部的運用手術，現在某要人背部患癰，經受西醫割治，排膿以後，施行縫合，隔不得十餘日，又起潰瘍，至今不能收口，」唉，焦先生！你老人家似乎太欠明白了，從學理上探討起來，二千年來貴國醫的方術，那一個人，那一部書，談得到根本療法，原因療法？一部仲景方，那一個方案，不是頭痛救頭，脚痛救脚？「口渴去半夏」，「嘔者加半夏生薑」，「腹中痛者，去黃芩加芍藥」，「小便不利者，加茯苓」，「無汗服麻黃湯」，「有汗服桂枝湯」，「有燥屎服承氣湯」，和「太陽病發汗後，身疼痛，脈沉遲者，桂枝加芍藥生薑各一兩，人參三兩，新加湯主之，」「發汗後，腹脹者，厚朴生薑甘草半夏人參湯主之，」「發汗，病不解，反惡寒者，芍藥甘草附子湯主之，」「不惡寒者，與調胃承氣湯，」等等，那一件不是頭痛救頭，脚痛救脚的話兒？最可笑的是金匱痰飲欬嗽病第十二的末脚，說道：「欬逆，倚息，不得臥，小靑龍湯主之，小靑龍下已，多唾，寸脈沉，尺脈微，手足厥逆，氣從小腹上衝胸咽，手足痺，其面翕然熱，如醉狀，：：：小便難，時復冒者，與茯苓桂枝五味甘草湯，治其氣衝，衝氣即低，而反更欬胸滿者，用桂苓五味甘草湯去桂加生薑細辛，以治其欬滿，欬滿即止，而更復渴，衝氣復發者，以細辛乾薑爲熱藥也，服之當遂滿而渴反止者，爲支飲也，支飲者，法當冒，冒者必嘔，嘔者，復內半夏以去其水，水去嘔止，其人形腫者，加杏仁主之，：：」讀了這段醫案，覺得細細碎碎，夾夾雜雜，顧此失彼，瞻前忘後，見一個症，用一味藥，而且用藥以後的流弊，層出不窮，仲景的手忙脚亂，走頭無路那種神氣，活描在紙上。請問焦先生和國人，這是不是頭痛救頭脚痛救脚的證據呢？唉！心地明白的人，是不必細說的，物質文明不發達，器械不利，診察不精確的貴國醫，那個談得到根本療法原因療法，自然不能不把頭痛救頭脚痛救脚的法兒，當做滿足，并且還有許多頭痛救脚，脚痛救頭的錯誤哩。焦先生反來誣陷我們，眞是笑話。（未完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答（續）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（十四）痢疾（下）（僞足蟲性痢疾）</p>
<p>問什麽呌做僞足蟲性痢疾？答這是痢疾的一種，是由於僞足蟲侵入大腸粘膜而起。問僞足蟲是什麽東西？答僞足蟲是一類原蟲，西文名Ａmoeqe。這種痢疾的僞足蟲，不過其中的一種，稱爲組織分解性僞足蟲（EntemoepeHistoiytica)他是單細胞小動物，静止時，可以區别爲內外兩層的原漿；運動時，從細胞伸出僞足，所以有這種名稱。</p>
<p>問這種病的發生，有季節和地圭的關係嗎？</p>
<p>答夏季和秋季最多；熱帶和亞熱帶地方，往往發生這種痢疾。問僞足蟲侵襲的腸管，在那一部分，侵襲的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>答在大腸的盲腸和直腸部分，在粘膜上起潰瘍，尤有侵害粘膜的深層，這是和細菌性痢疾不同的地方。問僞足蟲傳染之後，隔幾天發病？答隔一天到二十一天的潛伏期後發病問僞足蟲性痢疾的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答可以區别爲急性和慢性兩型。問急性的病狀怎樣？答急性的驟然或一二天內起食慾不振，腹內不快，惡心，嘔吐等，其後就來下腹部的疼痛和泄瀉。初起時排出水狀粘液便，和糞便交替排出。後來失却大便的性狀，純是粘液便甚粘液血便，病人或裏急後重，一天達十次到二十次。體温中等度上昇，一星期大都退熱，各症狀减輕而移行到慢性。問慢性呢？答慢性僞足蟲性痢疾，大多數是從急性經過中轉成的，也有再變爲急性的。因此病勢一進一退，有經過數年，病人陷於高度的　瘦，貧血，下肢浮腫。大便一天一二次帶腐敗性臭氣，下腹部膨滿，在下行結腸，乙字狀部間或盲腸部等處觸知索狀抵抗物。問患僞足蟲性痢疾的病人，有没有發生合併症？答有的。最常見而危險的，是肝膿瘍。有時膿瘍部達雞卵大或小兒頭大，起肝臟的腫脹和壓痛，伴以惡寒戰慄，或間歇熱，或見黃疸。其他又有轉移到肺和腦內的。問這種病患過之後，有什麽貽後病？答有腸的癜痕性狹窄，愈着，捻轉及廻盲瓣的閉鎖不全等。問怎樣確定是僞足蟲性痢疾？答從地方病性病人的粘血便，惡液質，肝膿瘍等可以推知，最確實的方法，是大便中的組織分解性僞足蟲的檢出問這種痢疾的危險程度怎樣？答如果不發生合併症，並没有十分危險。可是慢性的却非常難治。問僞足蟲性痢疾的治療方治怎樣？答和細菌性痢疾的治療，可以取同一的方針。但僞足蟲性痢疾，有一種特效藥品，就是鹽酸吐根素的注射，很有把握。此外像藥特靈（Yatrenro5）丸，痢生特靈（Dysentulin）丸的內服，或藥特靈粉末的百分之一水溶液灌腸，都有相當的效力。近來有用卡白松膠囊（CapsulesofCerpersene)，內服也很不錯。</p>
<h3>淋病治愈與否的决定</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>世人往往以淋病的急性症狀經過後，疼痛减輕，分泌物减少，便算淋病已經治愈，這固然是大大的錯誤。就是進一步講，有人拿人一大壞的小便到衛生局裏去檢查，找不到淋菌，即作爲淋病已經治愈的證據，其實也是一樣的錯誤。原來慢性淋病的時候，淋菌往往潛伏到尿道粘糢下組織，尿道腺，攝護腺等病灶裏面（病灶就是細菌潛伏的地方），不一定常出現到小便裏，所以僅僅用一大壞的小便去檢查，是不容易找出淋菌的，倘使馬虎的診斷的治愈，一方面使病人耽誤了醫治的時期，一方面又有傳染給他人的危險。所以吾人應當求一適當的標準，有所遵循，方可免了上述的然險。茲有德國醫學博士耶大松氏所選擇的三個方法，就是怎樣的决定生體裏面没有淋菌的方法，說明一下，但是關於專門的地方，恕不詳述。茲不過令大衆知道淋病治愈與否的决定，是這樣的罷了。</p>
<p>第一淋菌誘發剌戟法，　第二淋菌培養法；　第三補體結合法。第一　淋菌誘發剌戟法　怎呌做淋菌誘發剌戟法呢？就是淋病到了慢性的時候，照上面所講，淋菌往往潛伏在病灶裏面，如果不用方法去剌戟她，她是不會發現出來的，現在用一種呌做剌戟法的去剌戟一下，她就出來，容易給吾人找到、好似「撥草驚蛇」的意思，剌戟的方</p>
<p>法很多·再分段的述在下面：</p>
<p>（一）機械的剌戟法就是用一種金屬「步其」或擴張器插入尿道的方法（二）化學的剌戟法是用一種藥液注入尿道的方法。</p>
<p>（三）特異性的剌戟法是用一種淋菌萬克醒注入的方法。</p>
<p>（四）非特異性剌戟法是用自家血淸或牛乳製劑注射的方法。</p>
<p>（五）酒精飲法令病人飲用酒類的方法。（六）勞動令病人乘馬跳舞等勞動的方法。</p>
<p>第二　淋菌培養法就是用分泌物去做培養，但是淋菌培養的手續很麻煩，又需要一定的設備。</p>
<p>第三補體結合法本法現在還未達到十分可靠的地步，尙在研究。施用上面所講的淋菌誘發法所得到的尿道分泌物，用顯微鏡精密地去檢查，找不到淋菌，就是培養也是陰性的時候，總可作爲淋病的治愈。但是斷不能以一次爲滿足，須反復檢查多次，至於上面所講的各種各法，也有用一種的，也有併用二種三種四種的，這是要隨醫師的意思去决定，還有一句很重要的談話，就是淋病到如何的情形，方才可用剌戟法，這對於病人的利害，關係很大，如果誤用了剌戟法以後，就可以得到很危險的結果，這是要請特别注意的。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（續）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>㈡㈩㈥雙胎妊娠的處置</p>
<p>甲·爲什麽要生雙胎兒</p>
<p>女子的生殖細胞，就是卵子，這種卵子，每逢四個星期之內，只有一個成熟，在同一時期內成熟兩個的，很不多見，如果同時成熟兩個卵子，各與男子精虫相合，那就受胎了，受胎之後，同樣的發育，那就成爲雙胎兒了，雙胎妊娠，和普通妊娠，是有下列各點的不同：比普通妊娠的腹部，來得更加膨大。</p>
<p>浮腫較多。</p>
<p>呼吸特别困難。惡阻更甚。在腹部能聽得兩樣胎兒的心音。雙胎之時，胎兒的發育，比普通來得遲慢。胎兒與胎兒之間，能夠觸知凹處。</p>
<p>乙·雙胎妊娠在生產時的注意</p>
<p>雙胎妊娠的陣痛，頗覺微弱，而且歷時較長，因爲胎兒的位置，有時先出臍帶，以及胎兒的手足等部。又因子宮的收縮力，不很佳良，有時就起子宮出血，有時并四起子癎等患。雙胎兒在一百次當中，約有五次至七次的死亡率，比較平常嬰兒的死亡率，約有二倍，這是因爲雙胎妊娠的時候，約有四分之一的早產，即使非早產，竟能達到臨月但是胎兒在子宮內亦有不能完全發育的，等到臨盆的當口，也有發育不良而死的結果。</p>
<p>雙胎妊娠對於母體在妊娠中及生產時，亦有上述種種的危險，而在產後，易起產褥熱，亦比平常產婦，來得多些。依照統計所載，每一百個雙胎妊娠婦人當中，約有三四人死亡，所以妊娠之後，腹部過大，或大小便不通，或下腹及足部等處，發現浮腫，那末；不是雙胎兒，定是羊水過多症，或者；是另外的症候，都應從速就醫診察，以明眞相。（未完）</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第六章　醫藥敎育與刋物　第一節　新醫藥敎育我們中國。向來拿醫藥編入筮卜星相一起。上面屢次說過。所以醫藥的敎育。本來就無人注意。淸末維新辦學的時候。尙有重士輕醫的思想。記得上海有一位女學校敎員。不知因爲一椿什麽小事。被頑固派的敎育界公議。把他逐出學界。然而此人却就此往日本學些醫學回來。隠於醫業。足見當時的被逐者。和逐人者。都把醫界看得與學界截然不同呢。　民國以前。新醫藥的敎育機關很不發達。各敎會醫院的吸收學生。還和舊醫的授徒式差不多。北洋上海湖南山東雖有幾處醫學校。和軍醫專校。而純粹華人自辦的都寥寥。後來幸虧各省設立醫學專門學校之制。倡行一時。方始新醫藥敎育算有了些微根基。僅稱得起萌芽二字。要不是當時那些日本留學歸國的學生。採取日本的制度。把這過渡工作幹一下。恐怕到如今我們中國的自辦醫校。還只有一二處。而醫藥人材的大批來源。還不過取之於二途。一是直接外國回來的留學生。一是本國託庇於外人的敎會醫院練習生。而這二種人物。要在今天的潮流說起來。程度不同。合作困難。即使有外國人到中國來辦新式的學校。也無非在文化侵略中間造成些身價自高的貴族醫。與全中國的新醫藥有多大供獻呢。而近來新醫藥界。對於醫事敎育。還不免生了兩種見解。一種人看慣了歐美各國的現代醫藥。覺得嫌民初的醫專制。近乎粗製濫造。程度太淺。要想迎頭趕上外國。一種人深知全國新醫的缺乏。仍主張用醫專制。輔助大學制。使產量增加。而新學說以深入到民間去。然後從這淺薄的根基上再向前走。我們現在且把全國的醫藥敎育估計一下。就可以明白何適何從了。！自從近十年來。改組的改組。關門的關門。新開的新開。論程度。或者比前十年稍高。論數量。則全國至今醫藥敎育機關。還只有二十八處。內中借外人力量掛中國招牌的。倒有好幾處。姑且不去說他。然而平心而論。以中國幅員之廣。人民之多。即使此二十八校。年有多量學生產生。也只好稱之謂酌量的點綴。並不是適應的供給。而况此中畢業生一部份。成了師資和研究家。一部份任了公共衛生行政人員。剩下可以發展平民新醫藥的。就更少了，若照我前幾章所描寫的社會經濟。社會程度。可以斷言就是一個好好兒醫專畢業的醫師。已經在他的都市業務中發揮不盡他的所學。遑論鄉村了。所以全是精製的醫師。勢必又在貴族中討生活。那與留學生有什麽兩樣。換一句說。與外國人有什麽分别。再者現在雜醫滋生。舊醫囂張。倘若照精製的辦法。一則勢必新醫藥界。成爲偏安的局面。而使一班糊塗政客。像停易堂等可以從容鼓吹他的腐化思想。倡什麽國醫條例。二則現在因社會無知的需要。以致那些雜醫續續產生不已。少數精練的高才。旣不足以去奪雜醫之席。又不屑爲。偏要想訓練雜醫。納入正軌。恐怕事倍而功半罷。</p>
<h3>藥房營業之眞義（一）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>藥房原是醫院對等的名詞，因醫院是醫師爲他人治病機關，藥房是藥師爲病人配藥，以遂醫師治病目的之特設商店，又爲病人取藥便利計，而廣計於市塲之各處，論其營業性質，以專門職業商店，附以技能，服務於社會，以謀取本身之應得報酬爲利益，初非一普通商店祗需貨物銷售，而獲得盈餘之貨爲利益可比，是爲藥房營業之眞義。在各國市塲中所謂正式藥房，類皆如此，且處於國家法律管理之下，而提高其營業之地位，與一般普通商店只須有資本能力得以隨意開設，有所區别，茲舉歐洲各處藥房之現况，以窺其營業之眞義，紹介於吾國新藥業同志，當爲我同道所藥願也。</p>
<p>英國之藥房營業</p>
<p>不列顚有四千二百五十萬居民，藥師人數與居民，成一與四千之比，即有一萬餘人，英京有藥師二千人，藥房一百五十所，分配於八百五十萬居民中，其比例亦爲一與四千，國家管理藥業法，嚴密施行，與美國之管理飲食物藥品及毒物法同。其所販賣之藥品，自然以英國藥典爲標準，例如藥品之精粗含量等試騐法，皆照藥典所規定。其正式藥房營業時間，在城市者爲上午九時至下午七時，在鄉鎭者爲上午九時至下午八時，每週得休業半天，而普通藥商店不在此限。其配藥營業，有受國家保險法限制，其藥價僅取薄利，配藥手續費每一劑約取四便士半，最多亦不過五至六便士，故英國之藥師，或藥師所設之藥房營業，其所定之藥價，均受政府之約束，想爲社會經濟及人民之生計而設施此制度貨。（未完）</p>
<h3>診餘隨筆</h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>有一天下午四點，到一家姓畢的人家去出診，是一個十二歳小孩子患病，他們是三家靠一丁的，其家人訴說：小孩發熱三天，昨夜說胡話，早晨七點，請了一個道士，說有邪附身，畫符水，噴在身上，不見大効；到八點，招了一個祝由科，也無効；到九點，就近請一位郎中看看，開了連翹黑山枙湯，灌下去也無効；到十二點，又請一位某名醫，開了靑龍白虎湯，藥只有五味，說是古方，但是吃下去，不獨無効，反而抽筋了；到了二點鐘，只得請一個德國大夫，打一枚針，筋稍稍抽得好些，但是兩面鼻子，依然閃動得利害，先生看看，這個小孩，究竟要緊不要緊？你看他們在八個鐘頭以內，把中國三千年來醫藥的歷史，重演一翻，這不是滑天下，後來又吃明淸時代温病條辯的時方，最後乃用二十世紀的注射法，這因爲上海灘上，有五方雜處的便利，他們保子心切，所以使十二齡童子，在八個鐘頭內，受了三千年歷史演義的苦楚。像這樣急進的辦法，到也世上罕見，然而看官聽說，現社會的家庭，雖難得像這樣八個鐘頭演戲的怪例，但在八天內重演歷史的故事，是常常可以聽見看見的。根本上没有認識醫學與醫師的能力，一到了病重，心中慌張，手忙脚亂，某親戚薦一個醫生，以爲是好的，不妨一試，某朋友薦一個推拿，也以爲或者有効的，到了更没法時，就是底下人說，某處有一位東洋醫生，用氣合術，用竹筒按的，很有効，也請來玩玩，其結果，若是假病輕病，偶然表面上加重，而能自然治愈的，則誰是幸運醫。說誰醫好，若是眞正的重病，没有一個眞正負責任而盡心竭力的工醫生，去主治這個重病人，必致無可救藥爲止，這種滑稽之大稽麽？他們起初招一個桑田巫，是效法晉景公時代盲之上膏之下的把戲，第二次，效法晋唐時代的肘后方千金方辦法，其裏面是一椿悲劇。</p>
<p>現在中國的社會矛盾性，大多數所發現的事實，你說她可以憤激呢，實在帶些滑稽，你說她是喜劇呢，倒有幾分帶些悲哀，莊生有言：「仁義之端，是非之塗，樊然殽亂，吾惡能知其辯」。我亦有言，喜劇與悲劇混殽，正是有心人憤世之端，吾惡能不有辯？（未完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>娘兒們也不行</h3>
<p>— 虞明</p>
<p>林語堂先生只偑服「論語」，不崇拜孟子，所以他要讓娘兒們來幹一下。其實，孟夫子說過的：『養生者不足以當大事，唯送死可以當大事』。娘兒們只會『養生』，不會『送死』，如何可以呌她們來治天下！</p>
<p>『養生』得太多了，就有人滿之患，於是你搶我奪，天下大亂。非得有人來實</p>
<p>行送死政策，呌大家一批批去送死，只剩下他們自已不可。這只有男子漢幹得出來。所以文官武將都由男子包辦，是並非無功受祿的。自然不是男子全體，例如林語堂先生舉出的羅曼，羅蘭等等就不在內。</p>
<p>懂得這層道理，才明白軍縮會議，世界經濟會議，廢止內戰同盟等等，都只是一些男子漢騙娘兒們的玩意兒：他們自已心裏是雪亮的：只有『送死』可以治國而平天下，！送死者，送别人去爲着自已死之謂也。　就說大多數『别人』不願意去死，因而請慈母性的娘兒們來治理罷，那也是不行的。林黛玉說：『不是東風壓倒西風，就是西風壓倒東風』，這就是女界的『內戰』也是永遠不息的意思。雖說娘兒們打起仗來不用機關槍，然而動不動就抓破臉皮也就不得了。何况『東風』和『西風』之間，還有另一種女人，她們專門在挑撥，敎唆，搬弄是非。總之，爭吵和打架也是女治主義國家的國粹，而且還要劇烈些。所以假定娘兒們來統治了，天下固然仍舊不得太平，而且我們的耳根更是一刻兒不得安静了。</p>
<p>人們以爲天下的亂是由於男子愛打仗，其實不然的。這原因還在於打仗打得不澈底，和打仗没有認淸眞正的寃家。如果認淸了寃家，又不像娘兒們似的空嚷嚷，而能夠紥實的打硬仗，那也許眞把愛打仗的男女們的種都給滅了。而娘兒們都大半是第三種：東風吹來往西倒，西風吹來往東倒，弄得循環報復，没有個結賬的日子。同時，每一次打仗一因爲她們倒得快，就總不會澈底，又因爲她們大都特别認不淸寃家，就永久只有糾纏，没有淸賬。統治着的男子漢，其實要感謝她們的。</p>
<p>所以現在世界的糟，不在於統治者是男子，而在這男子在女人的地統治。以妾婦之道治天下，天下那得不糟；</p>
<p>舉半個倒罷：明朝的魏忠賢是太監！半個女人，他治天下的時候，弄得民不聊生，到處『養生』了許我乾兒孫，把人的血肉廉恥當饅頭似的呑噬，而他的狐羣狗黨還擁戴他配享孔廟，繼承道統。半個女人的統治尙且如此可怕。何况還是整個的女人呢！</p>
<h3>以生命寫成的文章</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>偶閱昨非庵日纂，看見裏面有一條：梅詢爲翰林學士。一日，書詔苦多，操觚循階而行，見一老卒臥日中，欠伸甚適，梅嘆曰：「暢哉！」已而問其識字否，答不識：曰：「更快活也！」說起不識字的快活，在識字的人眼裏看來，的確很是有味。文人的習氣大都相同，不論古今中外，凡是搖筆桿同志，没有一個不深自怨艾，懊恨當年不該走這條末路。</p>
<p>但像梅詢他老人家，是在筆桿上得了志的；旣經有此出產，似乎也大可以已了。可是見一個正在欠伸的老卒，便恁地羨慕，無非因爲天天寫着「欽此·」</p>
<p>，搖自已的筆桿，做别人的文章，心裏有些厭倦罷了。</p>
<p>其實要想從筆桿裏搖出來的，全是自已的文章，不但在「皇帝陛下」的時候有許多障碍，就使現在，也還同樣的辦不到。</p>
<p>如果眞要寫自已的文章，那還是不搖筆桿的好！像那個老卒，雖然不識字，但他做了一生人，便是一篇大文章；在太陽裏打欠伸，更是妙手獨到之處。連「士大夫階級」的驕子，也還得讚一聲「暢哉！」</p>
<p>因此想到有島武郎在藝術與生活裏，所說「以生命寫成的文章」，和這個老卒頗有些相像。但他所提起的是釋迦，基督，蘇格拉底，這三個被稱爲世界三聖的。一生不曾親自寫過東西給後世：他們所遺留下來的說敎，大都是一些隨時隨地的意見，和茶餘酒後的閒談。這些也便是蘊蓄着他們偉大的思想，照耀着天下後世的大文章。</p>
<p>寄放着釋迦，基督，蘇格拉底思想的文章，在昔印上了我們祖先的腦海，如今印上了我們的腦海，往後還得世世代代的印到我們子孫的腦海裏去。可是那位老卒以及和他同樣的那些文章，郤早已跟着他們的生命同歸於盡了。</p>
<p>這緣故，自然因爲像老卒那樣的文章比較平庸，和時代社會所發生的關係太少。但無論其爲永久或暫時，文章郤還是他的。</p>
<p>用生命來寫成的，都是自已的文章！</p>
<h3>關於「敎育小說」</h3>
<p>烈文先生：</p>
<p>昨日返滬，明日又將遠行，許多事急待處理，對於今天『自由談』發表的侍桁先生的文章，勢必不能詳作答覆。而所去的地方，郵件來往旣多不便，報紙又不易看到，無已，祗得原則的說明幾點。</p>
<p>首先，在開始一節，侍桁先生指出『敎育小說』這名辭的『定義』的寬狹二種，他都『未免』</p>
<p>不能同意，但他在不能同意之外，並没有下一個新的定義，他所謂『明確的槪念的。』那麽，什麽是『敎育小說』，還是根本不能解决。侍桁先生在事實上，也成了他所說的『不只在鳳吾先生，許多人都是不能』以外的一個。這原因，根據侍桁先生的文章看去，大約是他没有把『敎育小說』，和『小說的敎育意義』弄淸楚吧。如果弄淸楚，我想，他是不會有寬狹之論的。其次，他指出我的『敎育小說』篇第一錯誤是把『大悲寺外』作爲敎育小說看（他說這是稍嚴格的講』，如果不『稍』時。不知可否稱爲『敎育小說』？，他的理由是因爲『大悲寺外是大描寫亟種典型的人，一這種把人物和階級生活背景活生生的拉開，只單純的考察所描寫的人物，把人物吊在半空的辦法，實在眞『未免』是不純熱的性格主義了。像這樣的論斷我不知侍桁先生如何的說明作品中人物思想行動發生的根源。而且，他因爲『學監和丁庚都是特殊典型的人，不能代表一切的學監和一切的學生的』，不能稱之爲『敎育小說』，我不知爲什麽『特</p>
<p>殊典型的人』一定要把他從那種生活環境裡硬拉出來，一定要『代表一切』郵階級生活環境裏的人物纔不必拉？侍要桁先生又根據「大悲寺外」</p>
<p>的那一點，知道「作者並没有要使他們這兩種人·和這故事的可能性，只有在學校生活中才有可能的那樣的用意。」如果没有根據，這種論斷，無疑的是十足的唯心·十足的觀念。再其次，侍桁先生說，「把其中表現的良心讉責主義，作爲敎育之一方法，以致問出這種主義是否能解决敎育問題，便更是錯誤的了。「大槪他的理由是「正確的創作方法却不應該引到良心讉責主義是否能夠解决問題之上去的，正確的創作方法和實際上能否解决問題，是毫無關係的事。「在這裏是很明白的存在着侍桁先生和我對於『創作方法』一名辭的認識問題。如果我是一個布爾喬亞的作家的話，那麽，我對於『創作方法』一名辭的認識，是祗限於作品的形式；但我不是這樣，我的理解是，『創作方法』是要從作者的「觀點」講起的，我不是一個內容形式的二元論者。侍桁先生對於『創作方法』一名辭的認識，究竟是屬於那一方面呢？屬於前者，當然是應該反對我的主張，屬於後者，那麽，我的『敎育小說』篇『更是錯誤』究</p>
<p>竟是在什麽地方呢？我完全不懂得。『而作者確没有想用這種花頭來解决問題』，這是『的確』的，可是我，在『敎育小說』篇裡，在什麽地</p>
<p>方說明了『大悲寺外』作者是要『用這種花頭來解决問題』呢？我很希望侍桁先生指示出來，我寫『敎育小說』篇的意思很明白，並非批評『大悲寺外』，祗是引這篇小說來作個例證，我是强調在反對把敎育從政治關係拉開去描寫，反對當前的以武力解决學潮辦法。所以，他對於這篇小說是否反映現實，轉變過程描寫的不夠等等，是與我的『敎育小說』篇無關的，我不想說什麽話。至於侍桁先生對於「没有這樣給以指摘的必要」的我的『那篇短文章，』終於因着『現今所正流行的觀念論的文藝論所致成的錯誤，極有害的，不能不講話」而賜予批評的好意，除了感激之外，我能有何話說？究竟誰是觀念論者？</p>
<p>我要簡單陳述的，如此而已。究竟誰是觀念論者，留給讀者們去論斷，我想侍桁先生或許再有賜敎的。不過，我在回到上海之前，是不會看到的了。萬一對侍桁先生那時的文章仍有予以原諒。烈文先生，爲時間所限，我現在只能潦草的寫這封信給你了，我希望能早日發表出來。此上，卽請</p>

<h3>生命與機械（四）</h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>「鬼纔打算明後兒呢！」</p>
<p>「好，就走。」</p>
<p>猛地有精神了，像老槍剛剛打過嗎啡針似地，渾身是勁。兩個人捲起草蓆，哼着肉感的小調，有意的踉踉蹌蹌地去了。歌聲遠遠在電車鈴的鐺鐺聲中消滅了。躺在　蓆上的人打了一個噴嚏，和背脊吻着地板的人一同羨慕地望着他們的背影。</p>
<p>夜漸漸深了，馬路上面的車慢慢地稀少下去。最後，只剩下幽靈似的幾個巡捕在馬路上徘徊。空氣是沉静的，江心，大輪船靠浮筒停着，桅桿上的燈映在水裡，像舞動着的長長的金蛇。</p>
<p>靠西的角落裏，在舊報紙上，躺着一個精赤的孩子，肚皮上覆着快要發霉的破布，鼻孔裏呼呼地出着大氣，瘦小的身軀翻來覆去地轉側着。呵，在那個小小的胸膛下跳動着的，也是一顆淫猥的心嗎？不是的，因爲那對大眼珠裡正貯着晶瑩的淚水。圓滑的褐色的小肩膀不時的抽搐，淚便珍珠一般地經過閃着幽暗的光的空氣中的短短的歴程，滴到報紙上：：：：頭髮白了的，没有鬍子的，一個一個地到了夢鄉。剩下的全是精壯的或是瘦弱壯年，有的把牙咬得吱吱地響，有的駡着汚穢的話，有的坐起來，把搭褳或穿着竹牌子（註：苦力每搬運一次貨物，卽可取竹牌，竹牌約分三種：十文，二十文，二十四文。在碼頭上，竹牌之用途與銅板相等。）的草繩解下，細細的數着銅板和竹牌子，終於惡毒地把别人的娘駡兩聲，又失望地倒下去，眼晴全是睜着的，帶着疲勞望天。</p>
<p>一個黑影突然從地板上站起來，喉嚨底呼喭地響着，「呸！」便吐出一口帶血的濃痰。肺癆菌在他孱弱的胸膛下活動，興奮着他的神經。他用搖晃的脚步走到西邊的角落裡，眼晴在黑暗裡冒火，每一根血管裡全充滿了沸騰的血液。他　下腰，血紅的眼盯着那孩子的裸露的肉，一隻發燒的手便撫摸着那孩子的褐色的大腿，多麽細膩喲！像猪油一般地光滑，他伸手褐開那塊覆在肚皮上的布，倒身下去：：：：：</p>
<p>「怎樣啦？」小孩從夢裡醒來，惺忪着眼掙扎。</p>
<p>「小方，小寳貝，小心肝，别動！」一串顫抖的聲音。</p>
<p>「拍！孩子一翻身，一記淸脆的耳光，打在那張紅脹的面孔上，立刻跳起來，那個黑影便躺在原來的那兒，失望，疲勞，靈與肉的痛苦，永遠存留在他身體裡，直到第二天早晨。</p>
<p>孩子走到另一個角落，在那個安静地打着鼾的穿老藍布褲的人身邊，撲地躺下；悲哀和憤怒壓榨着脆弱的小心靈，胸脯裡像是塞着什麽有彈性的東西；睡不着，只好坐起來，喉嚨鼻子出大氣</p>
<p>「阿松，喂！」孩子拍着穿老藍布褲子的漢子。「天亮了嗎？」一翻身便坐起來，揉着眼望着黑暗的天，天上，無數的小星兒在煤烟裡頑皮地瞬眼。「還早　呵！」說着，又倒下去。</p>
<p>「阿松，」細小的手拍着寬大的肩膀。「别睡呵！」</p>
<p>「有什麽事？」有力的臂膀按着地板，把上身慢慢撑起來。</p>
<p>「我問你，我是註定要倒霉的嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦，」粗大的手指掻着剌蝟一般的頭。「你說什麽呀？」「我說，」孩子的聲音顫抖着。「爲什麽我就專倒霉呢？我没有爹媽，没有一個人痛我，在馬路上給人駡，在水門汀上給阿三踢，餓慌了，垃圾桶裡的東西也塡了肚皮。幸虧張老爹：：</p>

<h3>中國現經濟階段之認識陳鴻根</h3>
<p>經濟階段者何？一國或社會之經濟發展所達之過程也。然因社會中萬象紛紜，吾人所用以爲表彰各時代之特徵者，至難選擇；有以人</p>
<p>與自然之關係劃分（如Ｆ·Ｌist及Froose）爲漁獵·畜牧·農業·工商業各時代者；有以交換關係之有無（如Hilperprenp）而分爲自足，直接交換，及商品流通各時代者，更有以政治與經濟之關係（如Schmoller,）劃分爲村落，都市，領地，國民，及世界經濟各時代者；然自吾人觀之、此種種分類法、率皆偏頗，未能盡舉社會整個之經濟形態。晚近學者更新擬一劃别法，卽别爲原始共有，奴隸，封建，資本主義各時代，而資本主義更獨變爲商業，產業，及金融資本三時代，此說頗近於理，大多學者所承受，茲從之。</p>
<p>旣定經濟時代之分劃法矣，將進而究中國現時所達之階段，論者因觀察點之不同，所得結果各異，今略陳之，以示改革之途徑焉。</p>
<h3>（一）封建經濟末期</h3>
<p>其所引之證據有：　Ａ中國有多數與農奴相似之佃奴；Ｂ有限制地方經濟之各種厘金，米禁，統稅，Ｃ家族與同鄉觀念之濃厚；Ｄ中國之統制階級爲地主；Ｅ內地仍多有行會之組織，然持反對之論者，每根據是數項證明而攻擊之。</p>
<p>Ａ中國之封建時代早已結束！秦始皇時，卽以郡縣代封建，總理於民生主義中亦詳言之，惟其發展至資本主義之過渡時代則甚長，產業革命至今仍不能普偏全國，但不可謂其尙處於封建時代也。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）中國現之統治階級非地主！中國封建制度，旣早經破壞，又復受古限田制，班田制，及多子承繼之影響；卒使中國土地之分配，入於較爲平均之狀態，計有地十畝至二十畝者佔全體百分之七十，年來十畝至二十畝之小農復有增加之趨勢，而五十畝以上之地主反日見減少，據此則中國並無多數之大地主，更不能稱其爲統制階級。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）中國之自耕農多於佃農！證之事實，除廣東外，其餘各省之自耕農多於佃農者至數倍，而廣東之所以具此畸形之發展，實由於人口稠密，地價高漲，土質不同，及其他政治之關係所致，不可以言全國也。</p>
<p>Ｄ地方經濟之限制大部已廢除！自國民政府明令裁厘後，各省相率奉行，茲所舉者極少數之例外而已。</p>
<h3>（二）產業資本時代</h3>
<p>封建之說旣不確矣，　　有以產業資本時代之論進者，其言曰：Ａ沿海各口岸已有大規模之工業Ｂ城市人口之臌漲　Ｃ資本之集中Ｄ金融資本之發達Ｅ農村經濟及小手工業之崩潰。</p>
<p>然其說未足全信也；可以從客觀之分析，以證明其眞僞：</p>
<p>（Ａ）沿海各地之工業甚爲幼稚；據海關之報告，中國機器輸入數量，民元爲四·五三三·七九一兩，二十一年爲二二·九五二·一二七（金單位），由此可見其發展之緩慢。更有進者，我國各種基本工業中之外資勢力絶形澎湃，卽以紡織業觀之，英日在華之紡織機數，幾與我國相等，而自資本之大小言，則中外資本之總額爲四，五○○·○○○·○○○元，其中日資竟佔三，○○○·○○○·○○○之多，言之令人昨舌。更自煤礦業言之，我國年產煤量不過二千萬噸，年來產額之所以稍有增加，實由於外資之開採。中國之投資額爲二六·一六○·○○○，驟視之幾倍於外國之投資；但中外合資一項中，幾盡屬外人之勢力，此不可不辦也。再言鋼鐵業，國營者以成本太高；技能抵落，資本缺乏，鮮能與外品亢衡；中國年產礦石約一，五○○·○○○噸，多以原形運往日本，是以生礦每年出超，而鋼鐵反入超，查民元五金鋼鐵進口凈數爲一八，二四二·○八二關兩，而至十九年則進爲八四，八五○·二九五關兩，可以見漏巵之大。同時國內鋼鐵業又爲日人所操縱，綜上以觀，則可以明瞭我國工業之幼稚，及外資之勢力矣。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）中國現時各大都市人口之激增，乃以鄉村盜匪爲患，富有者多遷入都市，或託庇於租界，地價因以增高，此產業凋蔽，民生不遂之病象也，奚可斷爲工商業發達之衕兆哉？</p>
<p>（Ｃ）上海最近數年來資本確有集中之趨勢，考其原因，並非由於巨額產業資本之需要，而係大量商業資本之積餘。其所以致是者，一則因內地匪患，使上海資本不能投資，而內地欠上海之欵，必以現金償還；再則因銀價跌落，外人之盈餘不願寄回本國，遂留滯於上海，同時富有者擁產避居上海，亦使通貨發生膨脹之現象。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）金融事業之所以發達，亦正因工商業無十足之進展；資本充斥市塲，不得不投之於金融事業；且自銀行之本身言之，其最佔優勢者厥爲外資之銀行，以言銀行數則中國一四一家，外籍六三家，以資本額言，我國銀行資本在一千萬元以上者僅中國，交通，中央，國貨四家，而外籍則有十七行之多。中國資本總額</p>
<p>僅六萬萬元，外資達十一萬元，以存欵數，發行紙幣額，及投資額言，其勢力或與吾國銀行相埓，或且過之。</p>
<p>（Ｅ）農村經濟之破產，非由於工業之侵入，實因匪患之蹂躪，小手工業在內地仍多存在，上海之閘北，仍爲小手工業之中心。</p>
<h3>（三）商業資本時代</h3>
<p>有鑒於產業資本之說　　過于激進，而爲折衷之論者，以爲中國尙在商業資本時代，何以見之，曰，（Ａ）中國現在之商業資本多於工業工本，近日都市中大小百貨商店林立，其顯著之特徵也。（Ｂ）內地仍有收貨商行制度，在工廠不發達之地，商人多趨各手工業之製造者徵收其出品，以供銷售，（Ｃ）小手工業漸次衰頽。</p>
<p>然則中國究在何經濟時代乎？前人種種之說皆是也，亦皆非也，何則，蓋自其本身之發展過程言之，當在商業資本時代，惟以受帝國主義之經濟侵略，遂部分的進展至產業資本時代，而其他部分仍殘留前時代，甚至封建時代之痕跡，此其所謂中國尙在封建時代，商業資本時代，或產業資本時代，皆有其故焉，然欲以之衡全部之事實，是則謬矣。</p>
<p>中國旣蒙此不健全之病態，將何以拯救之乎？曰其道有三：㈠振興工業，㈡救濟農村，㈢振興工業並救濟農村。</p>
<p>持工業化之論者曰「二十世紀，工業化之時代也，日用之所需，工業品也，一國若不亟自行工業化，以適應世界之潮流，與人民之需要，則他國必將代行之，證之中國今日之現狀，豈不然乎？是欲挽救中國經濟之衰頽，卽製其漏巵，舍工業化之道無由焉。」</p>
<p>然爲救濟農村之說者曰，「工業化之政策，不能行也，中國之資本不足，受不平條約之限制，又復關稅不能絶對自主，國內秩序不安寗，一再足爲工業發展之障碍。且中國所重者農業也，據實部調查，農民與全省人口之比在蘇浙爲百分之七十五，在皖豫湘川爲百分之三十，其他省最低者爲百分之五十，平均爲百分之七十九，農業與我國人民旣具此極大之關係，宜乎其生產足以自給矣。但自閉關政策打破以來，帝國主義者挾其舶來品以傾銷於中國，農民生活因以提高，復以匪亂之騒擾，廢良田爲荒墟，在昔之足以自給者，今不復得有矣！卽以農產品言，據二十一年中國銀行之報告，年來進口總額竟達五六○，○○○，○○○元，處此劣境下，唯要之策卽繁榮農村。「</p>
<p>然自吾觀之，二策宜相輔而行，救濟農村自爲目前之亟圖，而振興實業，亦實不可忽視；不若則農村繁榮而後，人民購買力增高，彼時若無物以供其消費，則終必仰求於外貨，覆蹈前轍，我政府之積極勦匪，卽爲安定農村之方策，而去歲實業部復有四年計劃之擬議，並已漸次實行，余是以曰「中國經濟之復興，已有一線之曙光矣！」</p>
<h3>我國經濟破壞之由來及其救濟（陳森甫）</h3>
<p>一家之經濟富裕，則生活安定可以樂其業，一國之經濟充足，則百業發皇國家享其利。吾國數十年來，外受帝國主義之侵略，內有苛捐雜稅之榨取，國脈民生，　喪殊甚。近年以來，因農產品之落價，農村經濟，更見惡劣。謀復興之若多矣，欲以農產品來復興農村，是否可以紓農困，頗有研究之價値。就吾國經濟破壞之由來，而後及其補救之道。</p>
<p>吾國爲農業國，農民之衣食，向以自紡自織，自耕自食，除納稅完糧外，以所餘者貨於市而易以幣，然後以幣交換其他消費用品。昔舊制官府有以所課之　，提取若干貯諸倉，（名爲積榖）備歲歉以賑黎民者，否則饑饉之年，麥粟旣無收獲，何來經濟　　，比積榖之制確爲救濟農民之經濟良法也。此爲吾國舊社會之經濟流動過程，雖組織不能稱爲完善，却無漏巵之患。海禁弛除，門户洞開，帝國主義之侵略，逐漸深入，其戕害我華胃最烈者，首爲鴉片，不但吮吸我金錢，且遺毒我民族，至今毒氛尙遍全國，更持其機器工業之發達，將其過剩之生產，以我國爲傾銷之尾閭，其中輸入以棉紡織物爲大宗，次爲食料如菸草砂糖海產品，以及內戰用之槍械砲彈，復因國人物質享用偏尙「洋」化，奢侈品之輸入亦甚可觀，又次方爲各項工業用品。而近數年最足驚人者，厥爲農產品中之米棉麥，幾佔進口貨之第一位。綜上一切我歷年所溢出之金錢，殊難以詳確數字可計，然爲我國之資源，而被帝國主義侵略以去，國安得而不窮，民安得而不貧，是爲經濟竭厥之第一原因也。甲午中日之役，庚子聯軍之役，皆爲城下之盟，而割地賠欵以　事者。於焉國內經濟卽起杌隉。又民國建元以迄於今二十二年，此二十二年中，無年無內戰，凡戰爭而耗去之槍彈糧餉，以及戰區內民衆所喪失之財賦物品，綜其損失，當亦非可以數計，此爲經濟竭蹶之第二原因也。政治之淸濁，與國家經濟之榮枯，亦有莫大之關係。今者割據之局面未盡，暴征苛歛，誅求無饜，赤氛猶張，匪患不絶，加以頻年以來，水旱諸災，交相洊至，此皆影響於國內經濟，而爲竭蹶之第三原因也。</p>
<p>綜上三點，可知我國經濟之竭蹶，已歴數十年，然何以至今日而始感到衰落！恐慌上崩潰，其故由於疇昔政府當借用外債，更有海外華僑年滙大批銀欵回國，故得以調劑金融盈虚，且　年海關人超，亦無邇年之巨，因我國運出之生絲，大荳，桐油，以及茶葉蛋質與華僑</p>
<p>承銷國內之各種機製工業品，以故每年出品之總値，爲數亦頗巨，非若近數年之衰頽不振也。自國都南遷，不舉外債，華僑匯欵，不因無所保障而不敢滙，卽因營業失敗而不得滙，加以異族凌虐，家尙無暇曕顧，遑論乎滙欵回國，卽此兩端已足使我經濟竭蹶之國，捉衿而露肘。何况比年我國出口品之滯銷者滯銷，被奪者被奪，减者减而絶者絶，茲分析其槪况而詳言之。</p>
<p>我國向居出口貨第一位之生絲，因育　之法不從科學上研究，一味墨守陳章，以故凌夷之况，早伏於一二十年之前，自日本意大利兩國之絲，在世界市塲競爭以來，華絲銷路每下愈况，查自民國十四年，運出十五萬五千餘擔，價値一億二千九百餘萬兩，自後則逐年减少，價亦步步低落，逮及去年，幾陷絶境。今雖稍有起色，然有操着先鞭之日絲在前，决無多大希冀，至第二位之出口品，當推大荳，大荳之大量產額，乃在東北數省，其產額，約佔全國百分之六十七强，民國十八年，綜荳類一項，（包含荳油荳餅荳粕等在內），總値三億四千二百五十餘萬兩，實駕生絲而上之，今物是而人非，此絶大財源，盡入暴日囊棄，若不將失地收回，則利權永非我屬，其爲害我國經濟爲何如耶？　近代建築事業，日益趨精，是以油漆之爲用亦大，油漆之主要原料，乃屬桐油，桐油爲吾國之特產，其產區以川湘鄂三省爲大宗，民國十九年，出口價値亦有三千二百五十餘萬兩，其銷塲，美國約佔總值百分之八十左右，近因製煉方法，不求推進，加以奸商不顧國際貿易信用，摻攙僞質，更因地方不靖，轉輸時有阻撓，不得按期交貨，引起美人異常不滿，以故彼在國內，早已試行種植，將來無論成績若何，而在吾國輸出量上，必受絶大影響。中國在數十年前，爲產茶最盛之國；全世界之用茶，無不由我供給，其輸出總値乃與生絲相頡頏，自印度錫蘭爪哇以及東瀛鳥國諸茶，先後崛起，競爭於市塲，我國茶業，遂慘落至於不能自振，近更益趨衰微，尙不若蛋類之總値，民國十九年，蛋類一項，如鮮蛋，乾蛋，蛋粉，蛋質，以及皮蛋鹹蛋等，亦總値五千二百餘萬兩，而蛋類爲微物，出口乃有如此之巨額。但近來內地蛋價低已較前低廉，恐輸出亦已較前稍减，而向負盛名之茶葉，同年之出口値，僅二千二百五十餘萬兩，與昔年最盛時之出口値一億一千餘萬兩相比，幾等於零。溯洄往昔，可慨也夫！所有華僑承銷國內之機製工業品，一因日貨之在海外各埠賤價傾銷，一因各國之排斥我僑胞，我政府旣不作强有力之抗議，又不力爲保護，而自身之居留問題，尙費周章，何暇計及承銷國貨哉。觀上述各種出口貨，除已入日寇囊　之大荳，正在篷勃向榮外，餘皆江河日下，而輸入貨物，乃排山倒海而來，於是我國之金錢，乃隨巨浪以俱去，似此狀况，國家財源焉得不枯，農民經濟焉得不窮，此農村崩潰之所由起，商業凋殘之所由來也。</p>
<p>吾於上文已言及吾國爲農業國，農民又佔全國人口百分之八十以上，今時代雖稍有異同，然吾國工業目下尙在幼穉時代，曷可以言工業，故仍當以農爲基礎。如農民經濟裕，則購買力强，農民購買力强，則商業發達，商業發達，則國內經濟自能安定，國亦漸可躋於富强之列。但復興農村，先須政治循正軌，並吏治能緁潔，否則甲省正計劃復興農產品，而乙省則勒令剷除，而迫種烟苗，丙省則對此一息僅存之農民，猶强征田賦，至於再，至於三，以至於無量次，竟使農民賣妻　子，而猶不足以應付，致有將田契黏諸於門，而闔家遠走避難者。如此矛盾現象，安能復興農村？復興農村之目的，在於保獲農民，以求農產品之發皇。此外如絲，茶。植桐·養雞，以及其他一切之副業，而以農民所持爲終年消費所需者，都在必須維獲必須重振之列。但今農民受資本主義之榨取，高利貸之剝削，加以金錢集中都市以來，其所患乃在經濟之窘迫，資源之枯竭，致有田無力耕種，有桑任其荒廢，有茶儘其衰老，至其他一切亦無不隨之廢弛，今欲挽救此絶端衰落之農村，奄奄一息之農民，非中央有整個之計劃，實行之决心，不求調高，但求實事，舉要以言之，首要在各鎭村，普設低利惜貸所，及合作社，或仿蘇聯組織集團農塲，用科學方法，改進農作技術。至若現今需要最切之棉花，亟宜設法改良種籽。興修水利，濬疏河流，植樹裁林，皆爲農作上切要之舉，可以减除水旱諸災者，亟宜努力推行，不以苟行爲盡職。尙有其他副業，所須改良者，如左。</p>
<p>（一）育蠶須設立科學指導育蠶館，或組織集團養蠶所，改良出品，以與外絲競爭。</p>
<p>（二）植茶積極裁培茶樹，改革耕耘施肥翦枝諸方法，以期樹枝繁殖，出品良佳。</p>
<p>（三）栽桐桐油旣爲油漆之主要原料，又佔出口貨第五六位，應當着意栽培。且桐樹之培植，易而速，凡荒蕪潮濕之區，土質鬆軟之地，深谷山嶺，在在可以栽植，况不宜禾稼者，一經植桐，長成成蔭，落下之葉，溶化土中，地質卽變肥沃，故植桐之利益甚薄，且可化荒土爲沃區，頗有益於農產也。</p>
<p>（四）養雞現在蛋類亦爲出口之重要貨物，所以養雞亦是農民之重要副業，且雞之食料，不過農塲剩餘之榖類雜　物，故餐亦爲農民有利之副業也。若有集團農塲，卽可廣設雞圃。</p>
<p>以上所舉四端，爲犖犖大者，亦卽國際貿易上素負盛名之貨品，此外則不勝枚舉。但此數端，尙須操海外貿易之各大巨商，用全力整頓，</p>
<p>第一，必須免除貪利之心，切忌摻攙雜品，俾得重振牌號，第二，對於製造焙煉，當改用科學方法監製，更宜團結一致，以謀恢復從前地位，從前聲譽，此皆直接有益於農村經濟，間接有利於國家財源者也。</p>
<p>夫今再言其工業，吾國工業稍具鶵形者，僅絲麫紗三項，今絲廠幾一蹶不振，麫粉業亦衰頽不堪，而　具規模之紡織業，亦在岌岌不可終日之勢。其原因一受外貨傾銷之排擠，一受農村衰落之影響。處此危急存亡之紡織業，曾一再聯合　淸政府，减征统稅，及機械用品進口稅，未經批准。乃政府突以美意的借美欵五千萬金元，以五分之四購美棉，五分之一購麥，以爲救濟紗業。自此消息傳佈國中，投機家利用機會，製造空氣，日商更乘勢操縱花市，大收華棉，奸商不顧廉恥，爲虎作倀，惟利是圖，紗市爲之紛亂，顧客因以觀望，以致紗價布價相繼大跌。嗟乎，政府之所謂救濟紗業者，利未見而害先受，麥價亦隨之而跌，若將來貨物大批進口時，勢必更須下卸，在已瀕覆亡之農民，永無解此倒懸之厄。在美國輸出如許大量剩貨，彼國之棉，卽可繼長高漲，而我國購進之棉，因須增加利息，運費·關稅·以及回佣等，其價必超過平常市價，而在絶續如縷之紡織業，能否進此高貴之原料，每件坐拆六七十元，雖廠商欲顧全環境上之關係，恐亦不勝如此虧折。若政府體念廠艱，而折價出售，則政府不但减去巨欵，更値美國正在放棄金本位而謀貨幣競爭之際，設三年以後，我國還欵期間，適逢恢復金本位時，則所受損失尤匪淺鮮，雖償欵屬諸政府，而損失仍加之民衆。故棉麥借欵之用途，固能用諸復興農村，與振興基本工業，尙有一線之望。而欲振興基本工業，當以救濟轟具規模而現瀕於垂亡之紡織業爲先。救濟紡織業，尙有關於政治方面外，而其所患，在國棉之織維粗短，不能以紡精細之紗。且全國產量，亦不足以供紡織業消費所需，故須求之於外，致年有三百餘萬擔外棉進口，溢出金錢二萬萬餘元。所以改良種籽，繁殖棉田，在質與量均能供求相應，可以抵塞每年二萬萬餘元之漏巵，實爲當務之急。在質之方面，宜就河南陜西河北山東等省，改種美棉已着成効之區，盡量推廣；在量之方面，如蘇之阜寧·鹽城·沿海一帶，鄂之考感黃縣，浙之餘姚三門灣等處，均爲植棉良好塲所，祗須政府，在美借欵內，撥出一部分，就以上各地，廣闢植棉農場，且豫陜迭遭水旱諸患，農村完全崩潰，地方瘠貧，苟於彼處從事開闢，更整治水利，導渭南諸水引入灌漑，一面整頓交通，减低運費，則數年之後，長織維棉，自能供國內紡績業之所需，可無用外求，量之方面，亦能自供自給，則漏巵旣塞，農民經濟自裕，國內經濟亦充，亦一舉兩得之道也。</p>
<h3>蘇俄農業政策之變更楚</h3>
<p>蘇俄因去年深感榖類採辦之困難，食糧缺乏，農民之飢餓，農業之危機，幾陷不可收拾之勢。迨至今春，政府力求挽回之方，傾注全力，着手於農業之改良及收穫之增進；卽蘇俄自實行五年計劃以來，素以工塲建設爲主要工作，亦一轉而爲增加農產物之工作矣。查蘇俄全國之播種農產物之面積，約九千三百十餘萬頃，雖本年度之個人農作物成績，未見起色，然國營農塲與共營農場，竟收絶大的效果，（國營農塲之面積佔全面積千百萬餘頃，共營農塲占六千八百萬頃，至於個人農業不過一千百萬頃），爲近年來所未見。何則，此次蘇俄政府對華新農業最新的方法，其間可以特筆大書者　卽以黨部任直接生產指導之資，蓋從前黨部爲間接的指導共同農塲，今春農忙期間，政府訓令地黨部，直接親赴耕作地，監督指導其周圍共營農塲之農民，以機械力積極援助政府之施設。並令優秀黨員一萬人，配置最新式之牽引機二千五百架於農塲，賦與權力，以担當生產指導之任，一方選擇各大都會中熟練汽車夫，送至農村，駕駛耕作。因此蘇俄農家中占十分之七共營農塲，其內部組織之緊密，與勞動規律之嚴正，竟一舉而得意外之成效。蓋從前政府對於共營農塲之收穫，除必要部分外，其殘餘部分，皆比市塲價格爲低，（約二十分之一）完全講入。因此農民，卽有豐富收穫物，亦不願努力耕作。現政府改變此制度，就各地方播種面積中，指定一頃爲政府之分量，餘則均由共營農塲自由處分。於是農民，咸樂於耕作，力謀收穫之增加。惟政府所定一頃生產物，依照法律規定，絶對不許荒怠。加以政府在農耕期內，監督異常峻嚴，關於政府應有部分，派檢事局實地查察，按照分量繳納，以是不論共營農民個人農民，均不敢稍有違反。當烏克拉那國營農塲之榖物托拉斯德管理者，因隠匿收穫額事，爲史丹林所知，史卽嚴令該地方黨部調查，結果隠匿者四人，處以十年以上之監察，流放於北方。自是以後，全國農塲，未敢再有犯禁者，而政府與農民农人，均得預期以上之成績也，</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>怎麽得了</h3>
<p>— 小子</p>
<p>這是咱們中國人在對於一件事不能應付或是没有辦法的時候極自然極容易地流露出的話，所以在這句話裏，頗含有懦弱，頽廢，傷感的味兒。當然的歡喜說這句話的人，」命運「大槪都是「苦」的。</p>
<p>記得在上月末，咱們的應永久得諾貝爾世界和平奬金之和平將軍張少帥，在巴黎某次與法記者談話，某記者問少帥對於滿洲事變之意見及此項事變所能產生之影響等問題，咱們的少帥那時很乾脆地僅以「此」筆帳不知何時可以了結「答之。此短短一句話，雖是少帥好像以没有責任的客觀者的態度和口吻作閒情逸致寬大胸懷的推論；然在話裏亦眞正充滿了「怎麽得了」的懦弱頽廢的感嘆！！是啊，咱們的少帥是和平將軍，其特點亦正因爲他老人家亦是一員苦命的中國人呀！</p>
<p>雖說，「怎麽得了」是懦弱的，頽廢的，傷感的，但在苦命的人兒除了這樣意識或非意識的說以外，還有甚麽辦法呢？比如說吧，大法蘭西人宣言佔據了咱們的九個小島，咱們的忠厚敦睦的管理員并没有知道，一直等到小東洋出來不服氣要分肥，這才把咱們的注意力硬吸了一點兒去，說是咱們已經在「研究」，還要提「抗議」，而且是預備很嚴重的呢！但事實的曉示是這樣的：大法蘭西的三色旗幟已經高高地飛揚招展在那没有人注意據說僅有一些鳥糞的九小島上了，他們的軍艦亦在那裏泊駐着，一縷一縷的濃烟揚眉吐氣地從那些高大的灰色的圓柱似的東西裏吐出來，水手們狂歡高歌着勝利的戀曲：小東洋人亦極活動地没有放棄他分一杯之羹的要求和野心！然而苦命的咱們呢，除了客觀的看熱鬧以外，感嘆地說聲「怎麽得了」便完了，因爲咱們可有甚麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>不久以前，因長江水漲，武漢險又變成前年的樣子，那時國內確實熱鬧了一番，而好些好些人都急得在喊「怎麽得了」了！後來幸虧菩薩保佑，天睜眼睛，化險爲夷，把水鬼趕退了。但事實是這樣不幸的，近來報紙上爲黃河水勢將奪運入准而又在喧騰呐喊了。咱們的山東主席急得大有「怎麽得了」的樣子，鬍子頭髮一把抓，打一個十萬火急的電報給中央第一句話就是請「籌放急賑」，中央是最顧卹民瘼的，想必聽了也是很「作急」的囉！咱倒是因爲那邊有好些親戚，而且祖宗骨頭都在那邊，可是没有佛菩薩的神靈趕不退「水鬼」，平時又没有錢去修堤築壩，實在也絶對不會有誰想到去修去築（因爲大家都很忙呀！），到現在只好乾急得喊「怎麽得了！」「怎麽得了！」</p>
<p>關於咱們該喊「怎麽得了」的事，在現在竟多得連把鋼筆尖寫斷了也寫不完，而且咱也不高興寫了。但咱得了一個啓示：</p>
<p>人，儘是不動地酣睡着，必然的總是要被蓋上一床苦命的没辦法的懦弱頽廢傷感的「怎麽得了」的厚重的棉被！</p>
<h3>Ａ鎭上的茶店</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>在這方橫僅半里的狹小面積的Ａ鎭，商業並不發達，茶店倒有四十多家，佔了全鎭商店三分之一，可算是Ａ鎭的特殊現象。看來Ａ鎭上的民衆，都有陸羽盧同好茶的遺風，故而茶店這麽發達，但事實上並不這樣，實際上跑去專爲品茗解渴的，一天一家不滿十個人。牠們唯一的營業，却不在此而在彼，是靠着「賭」的進益，以資挹注，賣茶兩字，是「賭塲」的一塊遮身牌。</p>
<p>這四十多家的「密秘的公開」的賭塲。範圍大小不等，賭的名式，倒挖花，碰和，牌九，搖寳，撲克，家家俱有，輸贏的大小，是視這塲合的裝潢的富麗和簡陋而定，有了精緻的陳設，方可邀得幾位「富人」的駕臨，没有錢，裝潢得簡單些，也只好讓一般農工階級的無產份子的光顧，休想博得富人們的參與，大約兩家上一些的，每天進出幾千元吧，下的也没一定，幾元幾吊錢都有。　這種「假茶店」的牌號，取的新頴奇特！　怎麽：「ＸＸ别墅」「ＸＸ通訊社」</p>
<p>「Ｘ廬」「消閒雅叙」「民衆聯歡社」，光怪陸離，無奇不有。外方人到來，招茶店　Ａ鎭的民衆，着實豪賭了，四十多家賭塲，還不彀他們的需要，在上月又產生了一家定名呌「三民公司」，佈置得富麗堂皇，裝潢得宏偉精緻，開Ａ鎭賭塲的新紀錄，爲首屈一指，總算不辱「三民」兩字。開幕後，富翁闊老公子小姐，衣冠濟濟，爭先恐後，紛至沓來。頓時驚破了Ａ鎭上寂莫的空氣。</p>
<p>我是一個窮喪夾肝的文丐，天然没有資格踏進這「銷金之窟」但聞得賭公司而定名爲「三民」，心中有些奇怪，難道這般老爺少爺小姐「呼盧喝雉」之際，來忙裏偸閒實行娱樂不忘革命而研究「三民主義。」那倒令人可敬，有去參觀一下的價値。</p>
<p>踏進門，就像上了火綫，眼前彌滿了烟幕，利害呀！這烟幕飛的鑽入了我的鼻管裏，靈覺告訴我這是鴉片和香烟兩種烟的成份，所以性烈異常，轉到了腦門竟一個頭昏，幾乎倒下來。五百支的汽燈，照耀得如同白晝，只見萬頭鑽動，人聲鼎沸，「白虎，白虎」隨着一陣銀洋丁丁聲音。同時又來了一陣「哈哈哈」「唉唉唉」兩種苦樂不同的聲音。偸偷地向桌上一望，不由的使我失聲的呌出來，花綠綠的鈔票，疊了尺外高，難道是不通用的冥國鈔票，不然那有這麽多。</p>
<p>烏烟瘴氣，等着頭痛。於是退了出來，打休息室門外走過，忽聽得一陣嬌滴滴的「一馬離了西凉界」女子唱皮黃聲音。恍然大悟「三民」原來是「烟賭嫖」。</p>

<h3>賞西瓜的一幕</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>隔壁Ｘ府裏的當差Ｘ阿祥在早上看見主人買了三担西瓜。心想妙啊！今天不是交大暑麽？這里東家的規矩，年年交了大暑，就得有西瓜賞給底下人吃；</p>
<p>那麽望了多時没有錢去買的西瓜的滋味，看來不多片刻就有「嘗」的希望了。「嘡嘡嘡」鐘鳴三下了，還不見東家賞西瓜下來，阿祥手裏在揩油燈，脖子早已伸得長長地探向裏邊望着，看有没有人送西瓜出來。好了！老媽子出來了，手裏捧着一盤打好的西瓜，走近來朝桌上一放，喊着：「阿祥，阿毛，根生，瓜在這裏，你們三個人九塊。」阿祥早已　涎欲滴地等候多時了，見老媽子把瓜送來了，怎不使他歡喜，不待「飯司阿毛」「聽差根生」來動手，早就老實不客氣地丢下了手裏的工作，急忙地跑到桌邊，伸了一雙染滿煤油烟的漆黑的手，對準盤裏三塊頂大的西瓜，抓來望嘴裏送，但見他無多片刻風捲殘雲似的早把三塊瓜吃完了。但服瞪瞪還望着盤裏阿毛和根生兩人的六塊瓜看，猜他心裏，一定在想；「這六塊瓜能給我一個人吃了，方快朶頣哩！」但事實上東家派定每人三塊，又不好老了臉去搶吃，祗得一眼不霎的對着瓜呆呆地望着不動。阿毛和根生在旁邊見了他這副窮凶的形狀，倒不覺「　」的好笑起來。　他有些難爲情了，回轉身子，仍去繼續做他没有做完的工作，阿毛根生在笑他，只做没有看見。這時恰好老媽子又捧了一盤瓜出來，打他面前經過，他看了一看，見盤裏乘着十來塊雪　西瓜，忙向老媽子問了一聲：「張媽」這瓜給誰吃的？」「給先生吃的！」他聽了說給敎書先生吃的，心想先生們食量小吃不了這許多瓜，　　　　把的這麽　我們食量大吃得下，偏　　　三塊，况且一望而知給先生的瓜還比給我們的好起幾倍哩！</p>
<p>銷國產呢絨綢緞　小草　　正在自思自想的當兒，那知老　　又捧了半個不曾打開的大紅　西瓜慢慢地走出來。阿祥想這是給張媽自已吃的，她多着哩！不妨走上去揩油一些吃。於是假意上去搭訕着問道：「媽媽！這又是給誰吃的？」「這：：：這給車夫阿蘭的」。阿祥聽了倒怔了一怔，心中一想這事奇怪了！馬上急忙地跑去問比他先進這Ｘ家門的阿毛：「毛哥你想我們的主人好不平等，一樣是人，爲什麽派給先生吃的瓜，好也比我們好，多也比我們多。」『阿祥哥，你枉爲一個人，說話不知輕重，敎書先生是上等人，理應有好吃多吃的特别待遇！我們這般下等人，難道比得上他，呌主人一律待遇嗎？這正是「牛吃稻柴鴨吃榖」各人自有各人福』。「阿毛哥，你的話恐怕不對吧！旣是我們與先生有上下等的分别，比不上。那麽剛才張媽在最後　了半個頂好的大紅　西瓜，說去給阿蘭吃，你想他是車夫和我們一樣下等人，怎麽他就和先生一樣待遇，超出了我們幾倍，難道他車夫也是上等人麽？」阿毛聽了阿祥的話，先把眼晴四下裏一望，見一個人也没有。纔後輕輕地對阿祥耳邊說道：「唉！你也多問了，本來阿蘭也是</p>
<p>下等人以前和我們一樣待遇的，只是他在去年交了「桃花運」給這裏的東家娘娘五姨太太看中了！於是以後他就紅了，各種待遇着實比我們不同哩！這也是這小鬼的惡運亨通呀！」阿祥聽了心中明白了。點點頭說聲「唷！原來如此。」</p>

<p>阿寳姐生得多麽的醜啊！鳥黑平扁的輪廓，還點綴了幾點缺憾，身材矮胖，走路時像一截冬瓜在地上搬動，誰見了都說阿寳姐醜啊！而阿寳姐自已，照鏡子的時候也感到太難看了。她的母親雖然還愛她，但和妹子阿串姐比較起來，差得遠了。所以妹妹常常欺她，没法時，只怨命苦，老天爲什麽賜她這樣的一具人材！然而最難堪的是阿寳姐的婚姻問題，她在鎭上是著名醜女子，年歲一年一年的增加，二十多歳了，阿串姐已經出嫁了，母親也抱了外孫。可是阿寳姐，還不見有人來做媒，做母親的人當然懂得男大當婚，女大當嫁，她着急的時候，也厚臉託人留意，人家只報以一笑。</p>
<p>附近的鎭上，一個小康的家庭內，夫婦倆和一個三歲的孩子，男主人在外做事，女的體弱不能操作家政，所以要僱佣一個誠實可靠的僕人帶領孩子，於是找到了阿寳姐。起初主人也嫌她貌醜，但終因她的忠心勤實而留下領小孩子，小孩子見了阿寳姐終是迷迷的笑。幾天之後，一刻都不能離開阿寳姐，就是小孩子的父母喜歡時抱着逗玩，他都要哭着跑何阿寳姐去，一到阿寳姐懷中又迷迷地笑了。在小孩子的心靈中，只知道阿寳姐待他好，每天抱他引他玩，哭了安慰他，晚上撫摸他睡覺，他不曉得阿寳姐面貎醜，常常兩隻小手捧着醜的臉龐接吻。阿寳姐自從得這天眞的孩子安慰以後，稍稍减去她的悲傷，一股熱烈的希望，滿望這孩子永遠的安慰她，有時問問這天眞的孩子，「寳寳將來做了官，記得阿寳姐嗎？」孩子微笑地不說話，催着問他，才伏在阿寳姐肩上，輕輕地附着耳畔說，「不會忘記的，寳寳做了官，買東西給你吃。」阿寳姐聽了，臉上露着微微的苦笑。</p>
<p>小孩子一天一天的長大，阿寳姐三十多歲了，仍在主人家帮工，小孩子却到遠鎭上去讀書，一年祇有寒暑假回家二次，阿寳姐是多末的寂莫，遠念着這自已領大的孩子！每次回家，終是掬出心般的愛護他，但是孩子淡淡漠漠，不肯和阿寳姐像昔日般的親近。阿寳姐想起來時常暗暗地流淚。</p>
<p>阿寳姐的年齡漸漸地使人糢糊了，孩子已在社會上服務，有了地位，名譽。當他回家的時候，阿寳姐終是問寒問暖，但在長大了的孩子心中·覺得她奇醜討厭，竟惡言相向。這時候阿寳姐心碎了，她知道她的孩子已傷失了天眞，她咒咀着光陰爲什麽過得這般快，非但增加了孩子的年齡，還帶去了孩子的天眞呢？</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>中年乙：那當然囉，多少宮娥彩女給他服侍拉尿，他還不高興，誰還要你這個鄉下人倒馬桶？眞是笑話極了。</p>
<p>中年丙：怎麽還不見來呢？大槪今天又靠不住了。</p>
<p>中年乙：你說什麽没有來呀？中年丙：可就不是爲了那兩隻牲口。中年乙：你眞是還想會回來麽？别做夢了罷。即算不給流彈打死，給那般丘八大爺煨來吃掉了。還想給還你麽？</p>
<p>中年甲：放大量一點罷，我勸你。多少性命都顧不了，誰還管你的騾子呢？：：：我再談一椿事給你們聽。太師屯的王秀才，總算是了不起的紳士了。可是那一次有一個團長，要他在四點鐘以內送兩隻猪和六百個饅頭，王秀才一時弄不着，兩隻猪，談何容易，你敎他到那裏去找呢？後來團長敎四個背盒子砲的衛隊，將他架去。臭駡一頓，還說將槍斃他。到後來總算出了四百塊錢，放了出來。可是這還不算爲奇，反正像王秀才這樣有錢的人，就是再多拿出一些也没什麽。還有張家　的一個莊家，一匹騾子賣了四十塊，錢聽說兵來了，連夜藏到壁洞裏去。到天快黑的時候，果然有槍柄在敲門，於是他又手忙脚亂的將女兒的一根銀簪和幾塊現洋也藏了進去。後來門打開了，一隊兵進來駐紥，其中有一個把一根槍掛到壁上去，槍桿子碰在壁上，恰好聽見裏面有洋錢的聲音，於是乎到晚上便橇開板壁全部拿去了。可憐那一個老頭子就這樣活活的氣死了。說起來你們恐怕還不信哩。</p>

<h3>Yellow River Rises Again, Jin Dike in Shandong Province in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Han Lingfu's Troops Rush to Rescue Day and Night   Shandong River Affairs Bureau Adds Secondary Embankments   Shasha River Water Recedes, Northern Jiangsu Declares Safety   (Jinan) This year, the Yellow River in this province could have been safe due to the breach in Hebei and Henan and the rapid drop in water levels. Now, the breach at Shitou Village has diverted eighteen rivers back into the main river, causing a sudden rise in the water level in the middle reaches. From 5 PM last night, the water level at Luokou rose by more than one centimeter per hour, and by this morning it had risen a total of one meter and forty-two centimeters, reaching a water level of thirty meters and four centimeters, exceeding last year's highest water level and setting a new record for this year, and is still rising. The upper and lower reaches are also rising. According to a telegram from Shaanxi, it rose another nine centimeters and one millimeter yesterday. If this water reaches Shandong, it will break the record of the last twenty years. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Bureau, reported by telephone from Taochengbu this morning that the water in the area of Shouzhang and Fanxian has exceeded the Jin Dike on the north bank by eighteen inches. Last night was the most dangerous time, but fortunately, they managed to hold it. If it rises again, it is still worrying. The people's embankments in the middle reaches are weak and it is difficult to be optimistic. Han has telegraphed the Fu Guoceng regiment stationed in Yanggu to rush to the rescue day and night, and ordered all county magistrates to go to the embankment. If any county has an accident, the county magistrate will be held solely responsible. Three of the ten dikes at Li Sheng Tun collapsed at the front and are being rescued. This morning, Han and Wen Chenglie, the mayor of Jinan, went to Luokou to inspect the river water. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has sent Wang Yingyu to Jinan to discuss relief measures for the lower reaches. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River on the north bank has breached, and the water flowed into the main river from Taochengpu yesterday. The Jin Dike on the north bank has not seen water for many years. The low-lying areas are now level with the water, and the high-lying areas are only two or three inches above the water. Moreover, the heavy rain continues, making rescue difficult and the situation critical. The upstream Dongzhuang also suddenly rose by one meter and three centimeters this morning, and is still rising. If the Jin Dike on the north bank breaches, the water will inevitably flow north, and there is a risk that Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan railways will be cut off. This year is the most dangerous for the Yellow River project in recent years. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Bureau, is mobilizing civilians on the north bank to build secondary embankments, and also pointed out that the river channel in the lower reaches is too narrow and there are many dangerous projects. If the upstream water rises and flows down, it will be extremely tense. He urgently telegraphed the lower reaches to take strict precautions, and internally dispatched Xu Baonong, an engineer from the North China Water Conservancy Commission, from Tianjin to Shandong to inspect the south bank downstream from Zhukou. The water disaster relief associations in various counties in western Shandong will hold meetings every day to plan relief. (Nineteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the water of the Dasha River flowed into Weishan Lake, the overflowing water has returned to the trough, and Fengxian and Pei counties have declared safety. However, the areas along the river that have been flooded urgently need to be taken care of. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Both Feng and Pei counties telegraphed on the 20th to report that the Shasha River water level has dropped, the urban area is safe, and northern Jiangsu has declared safety. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Zeng Wanzhong inspected the embankment along the river on the 20th to guide its construction, as the cooperation between the military and civilians in repairing the dike is related to the defense of the city. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Yellow River in Shaanxi continued to rise by one centimeter on the 19th. The water level at Heigangkou did not rise or fall, but the main current has not moved north, which is very worrying. The collapsed dams are being repaired. Liu Zhi telegraphed President Wang and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to quickly allocate huge sums of money and send personnel to Henan to prepare for post-disaster reconstruction. (Twentieth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Government appointed Li Zhi, Yang Ma, and Xu inspectors to prevent and control the Yellow River water. Li will depart from the province on the 21st, and Xu Ji, a technician from the Construction Department, was also sent to take a plane with representatives from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to inspect the breach and take pictures of the actual situation. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Liu Zhi on the 20th stating that there was no water in the old Yellow River channel four miles away from Lanfeng. It also received a telegram from the magistrate of Pei County stating that the water level of the Pei River was still stable and the embankment was safe from rain damage. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Provincial Order Relief Committee allocated 4,000 yuan to Heze and 6,000 yuan to Cao County for emergency relief. (Nineteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge Repaired</h3>
<p>Passenger and Freight Trains Scheduled to Run Today   (Xuzhou) Wu Qiyou completed the inspection of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge and passed through Xuzhou on the 20th on his way back to Beijing. According to him, the bridge, which was washed askew by the water, has now been repaired. Passenger and freight trains are scheduled to run smoothly on the 21st. A thorough renovation would require 20 million yuan, but there is no such financial capacity for the time being. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>General Staff Headquarters Sends Personnel to Survey and Map the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Wang Yingyu Heads North Today to Inspect</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Staff Headquarters has sent two surveyors from the Land Survey Bureau to the Yellow River breach areas in Shandong and Henan to draw a 1:100,000 scale map for reference during the flood prevention conference. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Yingyu, Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General, etc., are scheduled to take a plane north on the 21st to inspect the disaster area along the Yellow River. On the 20th, they convened the personnel of the commission remaining in Beijing to discuss and decided to convene a flood control conference in Beijing on the 28th. Xu Xinwu is preparing everything in Beijing and telegraphed the chairmen of the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi, and also sent a letter to the Huaihe River Association, asking them to send representatives to attend the meeting to discuss the scope, focusing on practical aspects rather than theoretical ones.

<h3>Chahar Province Reorganizes Various Armies to Be Directly Under the Military Branch of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Returns to Chahar Today   Requests Pang Bingxun to Move to Zhangjiakou, the Central Government Sends Jiang Bocheng and Hou Ying to Assist Song in Handling the Aftermath   (Beiping) He Yingqin sent Hou Tianshi to visit Song Zheyuan this morning to discuss the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province. The reorganized armies will be directly under the Military Branch of the Executive Yuan. Lu Fu, the Director of Education in Chahar, is still modestly declining. Qin Dechun is also strongly declining the position of Director of Civil Affairs because he is already a soldier and does not understand civil administration, and recommends Xiao Zhenying to succeed him. Song believes that the situation in Chahar is complicated and plans to ask Qin to help temporarily. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan was originally scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou today. Last night, he hosted a banquet at his private residence for important figures such as He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, Pang Bingxun, and Xiao Zhenying. During the banquet, there was a discussion on Chahar affairs. Song postponed his departure to tomorrow because today is Monday and the banks are closed, so the funds allocated by the Military Branch of the Executive Yuan could not be withdrawn. Pang plans to travel to Xuanhua with him. Pang's troops are currently gathered near Xuanhua. The amount of funds for the aftermath and demobilization in Chahar has not yet been determined. The 150,000 yuan in military expenses is just enough to provide for the various units, and there are still concerns that it will not be enough, so he is asking the Central Government to provide subsidies. Song Zheyuan will return to Chahar tomorrow and will first bring a portion of the funds to provide for the various armies to maintain them for ten or fifteen days. The Central Government and the Beiping authorities have decided to send Jiang Bocheng and senior staff officer Hou Ying to Chahar to assist Song in handling all the aftermath. Jiang will delay his departure for a day or two due to an illness in his hand. When the time comes, if the Military Branch of the Executive Yuan can raise all the funds for the aftermath, Jiang and Hou will bring them with them. The various miscellaneous troops in the Zhangbei area, Sun Liangcheng's troops have telegraphed that their reorganization is not a problem. Fang's troops are also easy to subdue, and Ji's troops should also not be difficult to resolve. All measures must be taken after Song returns to Chahar before they can be carried out separately. The candidates for the heads of various departments in Chahar Province are waiting for the Central Government to issue a clear order. (Twentieth Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin hosted a banquet at Wanshou Mountain this afternoon to bid farewell to Song Zheyuan, inviting He Yingqin, Pang Bingxun, Qin Dechun, Jiang Bocheng, Yuan Liang, Xiong Bin, etc. to accompany him. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The military expenditure for Chahar Province was originally 150,000 yuan per month, which was only for the troops of Li Zhongyi, Deng Wen, and Liu Zhendong. Now that the troops of Ji, Sun, and Fang have been added, it will not be enough to pay them at the same rate, so it will only be enough for supplies. Song plans to ask Pang to move his headquarters to Zhangjiakou, near the provincial government, and send a portion of his troops there, so that it will be easier to contact them in case of an incident. Pang is still considering this. In addition to the 150,000 yuan in military expenditure, the aftermath expenses have been decided at 100,000 yuan. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Movement by Japanese and Puppet Troops in Dolon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In addition to the puppet troops of Li Shouchun stationed in Dolon, there are also Japanese auxiliary troops and armored vehicles and tanks, but there has been no movement. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Songhua River</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Officials claimed today that the Guanshan (transliteration) gunboat fired on a 150-man anti-Manchu cavalry team on the left bank of the Songhua River north of Fujin. Later, troops were sent to land and attack from both sides. The anti-Manchu army abandoned 39 dead horses and retreated. Two hundred policemen are currently besieging a bandit team near the Songhua River five miles from Harbin. The fighting is still in progress. It has been found that this group of bandits has recently committed crimes of kidnapping people for ransom and killing Japanese and Russian expatriates. (Twentieth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Continues to Investigate French Occupation of Nine Small Islands</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the French occupation of nine small islands, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that the names and longitudes and latitudes of the islands provided by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs only included seven small islands, not nine. According to the calculation based on their longitudes and latitudes, they are more than 300 nautical miles away from the Xisha Islands, which is about 1,700 Chinese miles. The truth of the matter is still unknown. Li Zhun's "Sea Patrol Notes" are too vague and cannot be used as a reference. In addition to reviewing previous files, a consultation has been sent to the Guangdong Provincial Government to investigate and respond in detail before further research. Furthermore, in order to make the names and locations of the various islands in the South China Sea clear to the people of the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared to organize and announce the names and latitudes of the Xisha Islands and other nearby islands. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Makes Three Demands Regarding the Yuguan Takeover</h3>
<p>Demands Made by Lower-Ranking Japanese Officers   (Beiping) Yin Tong said that the three demands rumored to have been made by the Japanese side are: (1) We will not collect taxes in Yuguan; (2) The Japanese side will set up a telegraph office in Yuguan; (3) A small number of Japanese troops will remain in Luan Dong to protect transportation. Except for the third item, which is temporary stationing, the first two items were made by lower-ranking Japanese officers. We do not recognize them as formal demands. We will wait for Hishikari to arrive in Changchun before Huang Fu negotiates with him. It will not be a problem. Huang will also negotiate with Hishikari on the issue of taking over the five passes of the Great Wall and taking over Linyu County. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Zongze said that the military losses suffered along the Beining Railway were extremely heavy. He plans to finish all internal arrangements and then set off to inspect the various stations. The takeover of Yuguan is probably no longer a problem. There is no talk of joint transportation between the Beining Railway and the puppet Fengshan Railway. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming went to Tianjin to contact the Japanese garrison and returned to Beiping this afternoon to report on the negotiation process. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Burns Chinese Mail, Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Protest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a report from the Directorate General of Posts to the Ministry of Communications, mail sent from Tong County on May 28 this year was detained by the Japanese army when it arrived in Yanjiao Town. The postman was tied up and taken to the Japanese army headquarters in Xajiadian Town. Although the postman has been released, all the detained mail was burned. The Ministry of Communications believes that the Japanese army violated postal rights and should protest, so it ordered the post office to quickly investigate the number of items burned as a basis for negotiation. The bureau has now submitted a list to the ministry, and the ministry has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest based on the situation. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mutiny of Wang Yizhe's Special Service Unit</h3>
<p>Plans to Join Zheng Guilin's Troops   Wang Sends Troops to Pursue and Attack on Multiple Routes   Most of the Rebel Soldiers Have Been Dealt With   (Beiping) Wang Yizhe's army's special service unit, originally reorganized from volunteer troops, consists of about four or five hundred people with 130 assorted rifles and more than ten light machine guns. Since being reorganized, they have received a monthly maintenance fee of 1,500 yuan. Recently, they were lured by Zheng Guilin and a mutiny occurred on the 13th. One part fled towards Kushuying, and another part fled towards Wanzhuang, attempting to flee to Zijing Pass and join Zheng's troops. Wang Yizhe immediately sent Battalion Commander Hu of the army headquarters' guard battalion, leading a company of infantry and cavalry each, towards Wanzhuang, and Regiment Commander Liu of the 107th Division, leading the first and second battalions, towards Kushuying, to pursue and attack on multiple routes. It is reported that the unit was surrounded and captured at Wanzhuang Railway Station. A small part fled to Xiaojiawu, and Hu is leading a team to track and pursue them. It is also reported that the unit that fled to Kushuying was also captured by Regiment Commander Liu and the engineering battalion, and the remaining small part is also being pursued and suppressed by Regiment Commander Liu and the engineering battalion. The rumor that several regiments of Wang's army mutinied is not accurate. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Feng Yuxiang Talked and Left Tai'an Last Night to Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Sun Ke and his party arrived in Tai'an on the evening of the 18th and stayed at the railway hotel. In the heavy rain this morning, Feng Yuxiang visited Sun at the hotel with several guards, talked and dined together. At nine o'clock, Feng and Sun climbed the mountain in the rain with reporters.

They then served the guests black-faced steamed buns, two large plates of tofu, fried green beans, and a large bowl of white cabbage each, a small dish of pickled vegetables, and a plate of fried chicken and shredded pork each, and ate with gusto. Feng said that Sun came to chat casually and there was nothing to discuss. He gets up at five o'clock to look at the mountains, write, and read books, and hires two teachers to teach him social science and the Twenty-Four Histories, with no other matters. Nanjing is definitely going, but the time has not yet come. (Twentieth Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Zhaoming Speaks on Liao Zhongkai's Revolutionary Spirit</h3>
<p>At the Memorial Service for Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held the eighth anniversary memorial service for Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom on the morning of the 20th, attended by Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Jiao Yitang, Li Ciwen, Hong Ludong, and more than 600 staff members. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. After performing the rituals, Wang Zhaoming reported, saying that since the Premier advocated revolution, comrades followed the Premier and experienced setbacks and difficulties. Because of the Premier's guidance, they did not lose their way. Until March of the 14th year, the Premier passed away, suddenly losing his mentor. At that time, the environment deteriorated to the extreme. The revolutionary base was hidden in a corner of Guangzhou, surrounded on all sides by Chen Jiongming and others, and plagued by the troubles of Yang Liu and others within the heartland. The revolutionary situation was like being in a storm. Fortunately, the victory in eastern Guangdong brought a new foundation, re-establishing the revolutionary foundation. This was the result of the hard work of Principal Chiang and Party Representative Liao. Every time the revolutionary cause develops, there is a setback. After the victory in eastern Guangdong, there was the Yang Liu Incident. After returning to Guangzhou to eliminate the reactionaries, the Shameen Incident occurred. Countless comrades sacrificed in the development and setbacks, and Liao was the backbone of the comrades, leading the way in the forefront. His spirit of breaking through difficulties and his courage constantly illuminate us and cannot be forgotten for a moment. The National Government was established in Guangzhou, continuing the revolutionary cause, which can be regarded as the second development, and Liao's death at the hands of thieves on August 20 was the second setback. However, Liao's spirit is immortal, creating the third development. The revolutionary base expanded from a corner of Guangzhou to the entire province, laying the foundation for the Northern Expedition in the 15th year. After the third development, the Communist Party lurked in and destroyed the revolution. Even now, the remnants of the Communist Party are still rampant and have suffered an unprecedented national crisis. At this critical moment of seeking to break through difficult circumstances, we increasingly feel that Mr. Liao's great courage illuminates, encourages, and drives us forward. Liao's great courage was first cultivated through integrity. The so-called integrity is not only personal morality, but also political integrity. He focused on modernizing and democratizing the organization and system to prevent people from cheating. When Liao served as the Director of Finance in Guangdong during the Republic of China, he swept away accumulated abuses and innovated the system to prevent people from cheating. After the second year of the Republic of China, Guangdong's finances were a mess. When Liao served as the Director of Finance and Minister of Finance in the 14th year, he reorganized them. Unfortunately, he was assassinated after only a month in office. However, in the short period of one month, he reunited Guangdong's finances and laid the foundation for the independent military supply of the Northern Expedition in the 15th year. This is the effect of Liao's integrity. Integrity cultivates the courage of righteousness, so he accomplished things in the midst of the difficulties of the revolutionary party. Second, it is cultivated through diligent study. Liao held several positions in the one or two years before his martyrdom, including Central Committee member, party representative, and Minister of Finance. He was extremely busy with work, but he always read for an hour before going to bed every night. He gained knowledge through learning, which is the so-called courage of wisdom, not the courage of emotion. Therefore, the courage of knowledge originates from diligent study. From now on, we can only continue to work hard with the spirit of Mr. Liao's great courage. Therefore, I contribute to the comrades on the occasion of commemorating Liao's martyrdom.

<h3>Japanese Situation is Very Serious, Saito's New Policy Movement</h3>
<p>Already Visited Finance Minister Takahashi to Seek Understanding   Further Consultation with Suzuki and Wakatsuki   (Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito visited Finance Minister Takahashi in Hayama on the 19th, seeking his understanding on the issue of the national policy agreement, and exchanged views. After the meeting, the Prime Minister told reporters that he would meet with President Suzuki on the 23rd. The current situation is very serious, and we must implement government affairs with national unity. Therefore, he plans to discuss important national policies such as national defense, finance, and diplomacy with Suzuki. Regarding the issue of ministers without portfolio, the leaders of both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties do not hope for it, so it seems difficult to achieve. (Twentieth Japanese Alliance Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet members understood Prime Minister Saito's intention regarding the issue of the national policy agreement. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 22nd, a few cabinet members will also express their opinions for reference, and all cabinet members may approve it without objection. Prime Minister Saito's intention is to avoid specific policies and, from a broad perspective, limit the agreement to important national policies. Both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties share the same opinion, so there is hope that the meeting between the Prime Minister and the two presidents will be successful in only one or two sessions. The government is therefore optimistic. (Twentieth Electric News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the national policy agreement, Prime Minister Saito's meeting with Finance Minister Takahashi yesterday has resulted in the final preparations.

Secretary-General Matsuda sent a telegram to Wakatsuki in Ito, Izu, requesting him to return to Tokyo. According to the current plan, President Wakatsuki will return to Tokyo on the 23rd. After Minister Nagai explains the situation, he will meet with Prime Minister Saito on the 24th. Party officials said that they would support the national policy agreement if it did not involve specific issues. Moreover, our party has been assisting the government with this aim since the current cabinet was established. (Twentieth Electric News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The upcoming meeting between Prime Minister Saito and the two presidents, Suzuki and Wakatsuki, has been detailed in previous telegrams. However, the Prime Minister does not seem to have high expectations for the effectiveness of the meeting in strengthening the cabinet. Therefore, he seems to approve of the establishment of a National Policy Deliberation Council as suggested by Mizuno Rentaro. The Prime Minister initially feared that this was a trick, but now, because the issue of ministers without portfolio is unlikely to be realized, he has turned his attention to the National Policy Deliberation Council. The council will be chaired by the Prime Minister and will be joined by Suzuki of the Seiyukai, Wakatsuki of the Minseito, President Konoe of the House of Peers, Speaker Akita of the House of Representatives, and representatives from the military. (Twentieth Electric News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai leadership is currently in various discussions regarding Prime Minister Saito's meeting with President Suzuki of the Seiyukai. Their opinions are as follows: Regarding the national policy agreement, they are sincere because it is a time of national crisis and there will be no unreasonable difficulties. However, as Finance Minister Takahashi said, a vague agreement is meaningless. Therefore, the agreement should be based on the three guiding principles and ten guidelines that have been announced and within this policy scope. However, there is still a gap between the government and the Seiyukai on this point. President Suzuki also has doubts about the Prime Minister's true intentions, so the result may be counterproductive and the policy agreement may be deemed useless. In the end, after the first meeting between Saito and Suzuki, a council of elders will be convened to discuss future policies. However, Katsuuta Jugai and Yamamoto Teijiro among the elders have strong opinions, so depending on how Prime Minister Saito handles it, there may be disputes.

<h3>Japan Strives to Be Pro-American</h3>
<p>Leaving the Manchurian Problem Unaddressed   (Tokyo) The domestic issue of the American industrial recovery has now come to an end. After the war debt problem is resolved in early October, we will be able to pay attention to the Far East. However, it is noteworthy how President Roosevelt will deal with Japan. Foreign Minister Uchida has already consulted with the relevant authorities and is working hard to promote Japanese-American friendship. The following points are emphasized in the policy toward the United States: (1) Regarding the issue of arms reduction, the revision of the Washington and London treaties is necessary for Japan's national defense. Therefore, we will use peaceful means to persuade the American people and give them the impression that Japan's claims are justified. (2) Regarding the Manchurian problem, the independence of "Manchukuo" is a factual issue and will be left unaddressed. We will expect the United States to be friendly to Manchuria by increasing trade between the United States and Manchuria, and recognize it as a separate issue. (3) Regarding the Japanese-American arbitration treaty, we expect to promote the rise of public opinion on this issue. If the United States takes an active approach, we will strive to realize it as soon as possible. Furthermore, the movement to revise immigration laws in the western region is a good policy for Japanese-American friendship, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes it.

<p>(Dalian) General Hishikari, the new ambassador to Manchukuo, issued a statement upon arriving in Dalian on the morning of the 20th, entitled "A Message to the People of Manchukuo." Its content stated that Japan and Manchukuo would establish an inseparable relationship forever. Japan does not avoid gambling on the danger of its national destiny and withdrew from the League of Nations, hoping that "Manchukuo" will trust Japan's attitude and the sincerity of the late Marshal Mutō. The relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is now proceeding smoothly. His coming to office embodies the Empire's policy of strengthening national defense, completing public order, and hoping that "Manchukuo" will be firmly developed, coexisting permanently with Japan and Manchukuo. The management and implementation of this will continue all the policies implemented by Marshal Mutō. (Twentieth Japanese Alliance Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Trade Delegation to Promote Sales of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Jiji) – Five major trading companies in Japan have selected representatives to visit Egypt, Morocco, Africa, the Belgian Congo, and the Dutch East Indies to hold exhibitions of low-quality Japanese goods in an attempt to promote sales. The delegation is scheduled to depart from Kobe on the "Bomei Maru" on September 7th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spinning Industry Expanding Business Scope</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Jiji) – Japanese spinning companies, which have traditionally focused on cotton yarn spinning, have recently been expanding their business scope to include yarns other than cotton yarn and cloth. This is most noticeable with companies that have significant capital planning to start spinning silk, rayon, and wool. Their business now covers the entire textile industry. Companies such as Kanebo, Toyo, Nippon, Nisshin, and Fuji are currently making preparations.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses in Japan's Air Defense</h3>
<p>Military Conceals the Truth Due to Fear of Anti-War Sentiment Among Citizens; Japanese Military's Full Efforts Still Insufficient to Protect Four Major Regions (China News Agency, Tokyo) – The Kanto Grand Air Defense Drill involved one prefecture and four counties, encompassing over ten million people and seven major cities. Its significance was very great. From 8:00 AM on August 9th to 6:00 AM on August 11th, a ceasefire was in effect, lasting three days. The cost in money and manpower was enormous, but the military only boasts of its success and has not yet revealed the truth. According to sources in military circles, this exercise was a major threat to warmongers, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The enemy planes attacking Tokyo and other important areas in Kanto numbered only fifty, while the defenders were the elite air force of the three major air wings of the army, mobilizing all the anti-aircraft artillery, sound detection units, searchlight units, communications units, field artillery units, etc. The number of special forces troops mobilized nationwide reached 17,000. The army participating in maintaining order reached seven divisions. If war were to break out, the number of air defense personnel needed in military areas such as the Hanshin area, the military area of northern Kyushu, and the Hiroshima headquarters and troop mobilization points would be four times the current number. The special forces of the entire army would not be enough to defend these areas, let alone launch a large-scale expedition to the Siberian battlefield. This would drive the people to their deaths. The Japanese army is heavily concealing this terrible fact.</p>
<p>(2) During this exercise, the anti-war teams of the Communist Party cut military telephone lines more than twenty times. During the Great Kanto Earthquake, rumors spread that Koreans were poisoning wells, resulting in the tragic massacre of Koreans throughout the city. The public was panicked. If there is a war, not only Koreans but also their compatriots in the Communist Party will seize the opportunity to rise up. The misery would be unimaginable. The public sees everyone as an enemy, and every plant as a soldier. Under this atmosphere of terror, even ten thousand soldiers cannot prevent such rumors and anti-war movements.</p>
<p>(3) There are many traffic bridges around Tokyo. Once they are bombed and cut off, five million citizens will instantly riot due to famine.</p>
<p>(4) If the weather is cloudy, it will be difficult for the air defense team to fulfill its air defense duties.</p>
<p>(5) Tokyo has few wells. If the water supply pool is bombed or poisoned, it will easily cause chaos. Moreover, the water pipes are buried very shallowly and are easily destroyed by bombing. Once the water pipes are destroyed, firefighting will be impossible. In addition, Japanese houses are easily set on fire by even a small fire. Therefore, air defense in Japan is more difficult than in any other city in the world.</p>
<p>The Japanese military is doing its best to conceal these shortcomings, fearing that the public will learn the truth and develop anti-war sentiments.</p>
<h3>T.V. Soong to Coordinate Provincial Finances</h3>
<p>To Summon Provincial Finance Commissioners to the Capital After Returning to China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) – Financial circles report that central government revenue has been sluggish in recent months. Customs duties and consolidated taxes are not performing very well. Only the salt tax is showing slight improvements due to the strict orders for salt merchants to pay taxes and the effective management of storage and transportation. However, after July, the military and administrative expenses, allocated according to the budget for the 22nd year of the Republic, increased, requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars each month, leaving no room to subsidize local governments. In July of last year, T.V. Soong summoned the finance commissioners of various provinces to Nanjing to hold an informal financial conference. In addition to consulting on the financial situation of each province, he also instructed on improvement measures. The provinces and cities followed these instructions. After one year, provinces that were originally self-sufficient should have a surplus, and provinces that were deficient should be self-sufficient. However, it is now crucial to understand the current situation and to conduct further comprehensive planning with local financial authorities. Before leaving the United States, Soong cabled the Ministry of Finance, instructing them to order the provincial finance commissioners to prepare a report on the financial revenue and expenditure of the local governments over the past year, so that they could be presented for discussion at the meeting. The opening date of the meeting will be determined after Soong returns to the country. North China's finances rely solely on the Changlu salt revenue. Other sources of income are depleted. During the height of the Great Wall War, the province's revenue did not exceed 10,000 yuan per day, and the city's revenue did not exceed 300 yuan per day (excluding housing donations). After the ceasefire agreement was signed, the market recovered slightly, but daily revenue was still only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. In addition, rural bankruptcy is impacting provincial revenue expectations. The financial expenses for military affairs, administration, and education in North China are significantly imbalanced. After the resolution of the Chahar problem, the military's supplies are enormous, further increasing the financial difficulties. During their trip to Lushan, Yu Xuezhong and Huang Fu personally presented their grievances to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Huang Fu also sent several cables from Lushan to Acting Minister Zou Lin, discussing relief measures. Zou Lin also forwarded these cables to T.V. Soong, who was on his way back, requesting instructions. Soong agreed to convene a financial conference in Shanghai after arriving, bringing together financial representatives from Hebei and Chahar provinces to consolidate revenue and expenditure and then develop relief or subsidy measures. The finance commissioners of the two provinces and the director of the finance department of the Political Affairs Committee will all come to Nanjing. If Yu Xuezhong has not returned north by then, he will also participate. The date for this meeting will be before the national financial conference. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Sheng Cables that Ma Zhongying's Troops Have Submitted</h3>
<p>Hope for Stability in Northern Xinjiang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) – Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai cabled Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and various ministers, reporting on the process of Ma Zhongying's surrender. They stated that after Ma's defeat and retreat to Turpan and Shanshan, he strongly requested a peaceful resolution and sent representatives to express his sincerity. Negotiations have now been completed. Ma will withdraw from Turpan and relocate to Hami and Zhenxi. He will first send personnel to Hami and Zhenxi to prepare food and supplies. During the preparation period, the main force of Ma's troops will temporarily be stationed in Shanshan for a maximum of two months. The Ma-Shi brigade under his command will be transferred to Hami first, to avoid contact with the provincial army and the Honi-Kangxue troops. Dabancheng will be taken over by the provincial army. No troops will be stationed in Turpan, Toksun, and other places for the time being. After Ma Zhongying's troops depart from Shanshan to Hami, the provincial government will appoint county magistrates for Turpan and Shanshan. The provincial government will also appoint a county magistrate for Zhenxi, which was originally under the provincial government's administration, and for Hami. Ma Zhongying will be appointed as the East Route Garrison Commander by the Border Defense Commissioner. Local politics will be under the jurisdiction of the chairman of the provincial government and will not be interfered with. Regarding military affairs, he will obey the orders of the Xinjiang Border Defense Commissioner. Judging from the situation, he seems to be submitting. With this conclusion, it is hoped that order in the area can be quickly restored, and the recovery of southern Xinjiang can also proceed smoothly. We should continue to abide by the Central Government's intentions at all times. This political approach seeks to resolve the issue gradually, to avoid using force again and causing suffering to the people, which would be fortunate for the border situation.

<h3>Zhang Fengjiu Arrives in Nanjing to Welcome Foreign Minister Luo to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – Zhang Fengjiu, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Government's office in Nanjing, returned to Nanjing from Peiping on the morning of the 20th. According to him, he met with Jin Shuren in Tianjin. Jin still has matters to attend to in Tianjin and will travel south in three weeks to visit President Wang Jingwei and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He had originally planned to go to Suiyuan to attend the opening ceremony of the Xinjiang-Suiyuan highway on the 22nd, but upon hearing that Foreign Minister Luo Wengan would be visiting Xinjiang, he made a special trip back south. The Xinjiang province has been repeatedly disrupted and is in need of revival. The Central Government is concerned about the border region and has sent Luo to Xinjiang to inspect. The officials and people of Xinjiang are extremely pleased. After Luo returns to Nanjing from Hangzhou, he will pay a visit to express his welcome. It is reported that the office telegraphed Xinjiang on the 18th. It is expected that Liu Sheng will send a telegram to Nanjing to welcome him within days. Also, the Xinjiang province will appoint Gong Bicheng to travel to Xinjiang at the end of the month. Zhang Fengjiu will also travel to Xinjiang after Gong returns to Nanjing, he said.

<h3>The Palace Museum May Establish Branch Museums</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – Ma Heng stated that the directors of the Palace Museum previously felt that it was necessary to establish branch museums and had submitted it to the board of directors for discussion. At that time, it was decided to reserve it for reconsideration at the next board of directors meeting. As for the location, Nanjing, as the capital, attracts people from China and abroad, so it seems appropriate to establish a branch there. Other locations have not yet been decided. There are rumors that some of the cultural relics in Shanghai will still be transported back to Peiping. The previous board of directors meeting decided to reserve this issue, and it has not yet been decided. The next board of directors meeting is scheduled to be held in Nanjing in September to discuss the establishment of branch museums and the return of cultural relics. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) – Foreign Minister Luo Wengan has been ordered to inspect Xinjiang. There are rumors that Ambassador Yan Huiqing, stationed in Russia, will be transferred to Foreign Minister. According to sources, this is absolutely not true. Luo's trip to Xinjiang will only last a few months, and the position is already concurrently held by President Wang Jingwei. Ambassador Yan's task of overseeing Sino-Russian diplomatic affairs is important, and it is not appropriate to transfer him at this time. However, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie's intention to resign is quite firm, it is said. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Relocating Prisoners for Reclamation Clarified</h3>
<p>Internal disputes in Xinjiang. Since the Central Government dispatched a special envoy to offer comfort, Liu and Sheng seem to have made considerable arrangements. In general, this can be considered temporarily concluded. However, Xinjiang is located in a border region, and its situation, from the northwest to the southwest, involves extremely complex international relations. Any improper handling could not only cause disputes between the Han and Hui peoples in the region but also mislead the country's major plans. Inconvenient transportation and a sparse population are also fundamental deficiencies in Xinjiang. Recently, Foreign Minister and concurrently Minister of Justice Luo Wengan was ordered to inspect Xinjiang, in addition to general inspections, he also advocated opening up transportation. Among them, the most important and innovative initiative since the founding of the Republic of China is to relocate young adult prisoners to open up the border for reclamation. In modern times, the main purposes of dealing with criminals are threefold: First, retribution; second, rehabilitation; and third, isolation. "He who kills shall be put to death, and he who injures or steals shall be punished." This has been the case since ancient times. The state acts on behalf of the public will of the people, preventing the strong in general society from running rampant and the weak from being bullied. Therefore, laws are used to standardize them. However, retribution is too narrow and is not the fundamental principle of seeking good governance. Therefore, rehabilitation is more practical than retribution and is suitable for public demand. However, society is becoming increasingly complex, and the relationships between people are becoming increasingly dense. The temptation of a bad environment is stronger than the persuasion of morality, benevolence, and righteousness, and the effect of rehabilitation is limited. Therefore, isolation is adopted instead of rehabilitation. Those who are fierce and stubborn are separated from general social relations to maintain a good state of society. However, in the current state of dire poverty, people tend to take risks and destroy all laws to achieve their goals, and isolation will not be enough to contain them. The intention of legislation is exhausted.</p>
<p>The power of the rule of law can only enable those who are honest and kind to abide by the rules and dare not easily overstep them. If they are driven by hunger and cold, stimulated by the environment, and incited by desires, then how can they have any fear? Killing is not enough to stop chaos. Imprisonment and isolation are no longer a concern. In the past agricultural society, the highest ideal was "not to worry about scarcity but to worry about inequality, not to worry about poverty but to worry about unrest." Therefore, "equality" and "stability" were sought first to achieve good governance. Today, the phenomena of unrest and inequality are hundreds of times greater than in the past, and it is difficult to achieve effective legal deterrence through rehabilitation and isolation. The current proposal to relocate prisoners for reclamation is precisely the way to overcome the limitations of the law, and opening up the border for reclamation is also the basis for seeking equality and stability. This is a win-win situation that cannot be compared to other roundabout arguments.</p>
<p>This proposal to relocate prisoners for reclamation not only opens up a way out for congested prisons, but also gives the prisoners a path to self-renewal. At the same time, those who only know how to sit and eat without contributing anything to society can also contribute to the public. Britain's development of Australia also used this method, and today Australia has become a new country that the world envies. European powers such as Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal have all felt the difficulty of developing the hot African continent. Recently, they have gradually started using criminals to engage in this new path for the future. The Soviet Union's construction of the canal between the Baltic Sea and the White Sea, digging 227 kilometers through ice and snow to connect the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean, was largely done by prisoners. In addition to the practical work efficiency, this move also achieved the effect of rehabilitation and isolation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that this proposal can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Progress of the American Recovery Movement</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Oil and Coal Industries Concluded; Wood and Steel Industry Regulations Approved by the President</p>
<p>(Washington) – The American oil industry accepted the government's re-drafted oil industry regulations tonight. Although it has not yet guaranteed to comply with its terms, the negotiations between the Industrial Recovery Administration and the industry representatives, which lasted for over a month, have concluded. The regulations will give the President the power to manage the development of new oil wells and wages and market prices. However, the threat from so-called "wildcatters" has not been completely eliminated. They discovered the East Texas oil field two years ago, causing crude oil prices to fall to four cents per barrel for a certain period. Even today, it can still produce the oil needed by the entire country. The purpose of the government and the oil giants this time is to reduce its production. However, it is difficult to say whether it can be sufficiently reduced through these regulations. In addition, the wood industry regulations were approved and signed by the President today, stipulating a minimum wage of 23 cents per hour in the South and 45 cents per hour in the North. In addition, it can also control production and prevent the sale of wood at prices below the cost of production. General Johnson also hopes to conclude negotiations on the coal industry regulations today. The steel industry regulations have been signed by the President and will be temporarily implemented for ninety days. It is reported that the industry is very willing to increase wages, reduce working hours, and follow fair industry regulations, but it is unwilling to negotiate with labor unions on strikes and wage disputes. It has proposed that steel employees can formally elect representatives to negotiate with the company, but it insists that the election should be held in secret in the company's premises to avoid interference from the American Federation of Labor. However, personnel from the Industrial Recovery Administration said that this method would allow the company to threaten workers, and workers could not be supported by all workers, so it cannot be considered a good method. However, General Johnson did not talk about how this matter will be resolved, or how labor disputes will be resolved during the three-month trial period. (19th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) – After the dark clouds that have enveloped the White House for forty-eight hours were completely blown away, President Roosevelt set off tonight with a smile, returning to his hometown of Hyde Park to escape the summer heat. Roosevelt has signed the steel, oil, and wood industry regulations, approved the agreement between sugar producers in the American continent, its islands, and Cuba, and received a report that the labor unrest in the clothing industry in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut has also been resolved by government commissioners. Therefore, today can be called one of the most successful days since Roosevelt took office. However, Roosevelt's return home does not allow him to rest. He will continue to meet with several consultants and industry leaders tomorrow. The clothing industry in the three states has agreed to work 35 hours per week and to moderately increase wages and improve working conditions. These conditions will be made into industry regulations, and it is expected that they can be signed in Washington next week on the second day of the week. Now, Recovery Administration Supervisor Johnson will meet with representatives of the women's clothing industry tomorrow to negotiate an agreement to abolish the contract system. The 60,000 workers who have been on strike for a week will resume work on Monday to rush production of new autumn outfits. If wage issues arise again in the future, they will be negotiated by labor and management together. (19th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>US Control of Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>Agreement on Import Quotas with Cuba; Philippines Has Not Yet Agreed</p>
<p>(Washington) – American sugar producers have agreed on a general plan to control production and limit import quotas for sugar from its islands and Cuba. According to the Department of Agriculture, all sugar producers except the Philippines have agreed. The plan estimates that the United States consumes 6.34 million tons of sugar annually and evenly distributes all sugar outside of the quota among producers of beet sugar, cane sugar, and sugar cane. After the sugar is transported to the refineries, it will be stored separately. However, there are still a few details that have not been agreed upon. It is also planned to establish a price stabilization bureau to negotiate and publish world sugar prices daily as an accurate basis for daily trade, while not preventing normal fluctuations. Continental American beet sugar producers and Cuban cane sugar producers will each be able to sell 1.835 million tons in the United States, while the Philippines will be allocated 955,920 tons. However, Philippine sugar producers have not accepted it. The main reason is that it is equal to the tax-free sugar quota limited in the Philippine Independence Act. These allocations may be slightly changed, but the Department of Agriculture is already considered victorious for being able to convince all parties in the industry to agree on a general plan, because American beet sugar growers have demanded domestic production as much as possible and limit the import quotas of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Honolulu, and the Philippines. However, the sugar issue contains political elements. The US Department of Agriculture is dangerous if it angers domestic sugar producers, and it is equally dangerous if it angers sugar producers of friendly countries such as Cuba. The State Department will also be affected. Now the Department of Agriculture has mediated so that both sides accept equal treatment. For Philippine sugar producers, because the Philippine Independence Act stipulates that the tax-free sugar exported from the Philippines to the United States is limited to one million tons in the first year of the preparatory independence period, and it will be gradually reduced each year thereafter. After complete independence, all taxes must be paid. On the contrary, Cuban sugar exported to the United States can receive tax reduction benefits, so they think that they are treated unfairly and still refuse this plan. (19th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Pacific Institute Discusses Manchuria Issue</h3>
<p>Our Representative States Will Never Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>Banff – Today, the Chinese and Japanese delegations discussed the Manchuria issue at the Pacific Institute meeting. The Chinese delegation declared that China would never recognize the existence of "Manchukuo." They believe that Manchuria is a legitimate outlet for China's tens of millions of surplus population, and the Japanese side's reasons are difficult to establish. The Japanese delegation said that "Manchukuo" does not oppose the immigration of Chinese people, but this immigration must guarantee that their immigration is not malicious. If Chinese immigrants can adapt to the new environment in "Manchukuo," they will be welcomed. When discussing competition in the textile industry, a spokesperson for the Japanese delegation said that because of the superiority of Japanese machinery and the effectiveness of centralized management, the Japanese textile industry has an advantage in medium and low-grade textiles. The British delegation stated that they hope that the production costs of textiles can be reduced. Currently, the Lancashire textile industry is being reorganized based on this principle. They do not acknowledge that the superiority of the Japanese textile industry is the result of effective management but attribute it to the devaluation of the Japanese yen. The British delegation suggested methods to prevent unfair competition and advocated the implementation of tariff rates and other international rectification plans, because they believe that currency stability is the key to solving this unfair competition.

<h3>Zhang Qun Arrives in Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talking about the results of going to Lushan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun arrived in Hankou at 2:20 PM on the 20th, taking the Jiangguo ship from Xun. He immediately went to He Chengjun's private residence for a meeting. Cao Haosen and Xu Yuanquan also arrived, and they talked for about three hours before leaving. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun told a Central News Agency reporter on the 20th that the main issues discussed during his trip to Lushan were the suppression of bandits and the post-banditry reconstruction in bandit areas. Currently, the border areas of "Henan, Hubei, and Anhui," "Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi," and "Hubei and Hunan" are respectively overseen by the three Commanders-in-Chief, Liu, He, and Xu, for the bandit suppression. The border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has already achieved significant results. He Yunqiao also has a detailed plan for the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and its effects should be seen soon. The main force of the bandits in the border area of Hunan and Hubei has already been broken, with considerable results obtained. Xu Kecheng (Yuanquan) originally intended to go to Lushan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, but because Chiang Kai-shek was already very clear about the situation, he instructed Xu to return to western Hubei immediately and continue the suppression to eliminate the remaining bandits within a short period. As for the post-banditry reconstruction issue, a detailed plan is currently being drafted, which not only applies to Hubei Province, but other bandit areas are also being planned for as a whole. Regarding the reconstruction funds, Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei have already requested the central government to allocate funds for use, but the amount has not been determined. The provincial government should still find ways to provide small-scale relief at any time and handle it separately. Yu Xuezhong is scheduled to leave Lushan for Nanjing on the 20th to meet with the principal officials of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. Huang Yingbai will go to Mogan Mountain for a short rest after arriving in Shanghai and will return to Peiping soon. Huang and Yu had requested Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to ask the central government for assistance due to the shortage of military and administrative expenses in North China. However, the central government's finances are not very sufficient at present, and it is feared that only a considerable amount of assistance can be provided. I received a telegram from Lu Han stating that Feng Yuxiang had already arrived in Taishan, but his title has not been determined. The central government earnestly hopes that he will go to Nanjing, but Feng has not yet expressed his intentions. Fang Zhenwu's telegram is only a ripple of the Chahar incident and should not have any impact. As for the Sichuan affairs, because the joint forces of Deng Xihou and Liu Xiang crossed the Min River, Liu Wenhui's last line of defense has been broken, and the war should be concluded soon. The central government earnestly hopes that military operations will be stopped as soon as possible to focus on suppressing bandits. Zhang also said that the provincial government will order the counties to draft administrative plans and submit them for approval to meet the actual needs of each county. There are no changes in the personnel of the provincial government, and various rumors are not accurate. (Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Customs Revenue Situation After the Increase in Import Tariff Rates</h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Not Prosperous During Summer Slack Season</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The financial income of our country is mainly from customs and salt taxes. Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, the revenue from these two taxes has fallen short by tens of millions each year. The amount of losses after the Northeast three provinces were lost and customs duties were collected elsewhere has been repeatedly announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General of Customs. However, on January 1 of this year, the violent Japanese army invaded Shanhaiguan, then attacked Rehe, and approached Tianjin and Peiping. The Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao customs were subjected to pressure from the Japanese soldiers and successively withdrew to safe areas and worked within the Tianjin customs. After the signing of the North China Armistice Agreement, the war zones were gradually taken over. Now, the Qinhuangdao customs has been restored to its original state. As for the personnel taking over Shanhaiguan, they are preparing to go there at the same time as the personnel taking over from the military authorities. Counting from January to now, it has been nearly eight months. Although the revenue from Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao is not large, according to past statistics, the monthly revenue of the two customs was ultimately between 500,000 and 1 million. Assuming eight months, excluding the loss of salt tax, the loss of customs duty alone is about 6 million. After the expansion of the war in North China and the large-scale encirclement and suppression of bandits, military needs increased and expenses were huge. Therefore, the government was approved to implement an increase in import tariff rates from May 22 of this year to provide funds. According to the increased tariff rates, the monthly revenue can be increased by about 2 million. However, after the tariff rates were increased, it coincided with the summer slack season. Although the import tariff rates have increased, the increase in tax revenue is not better than before June, with only an increase of 300,000 to 500,000 per month. The tax revenue for this month has not yet been reported to the ministry, but it is expected to be slightly better than in June and July. As for September and October, they are traditionally busy months for customs, and the increase in revenue is naturally expected. (20th)</p>
<h3>No Effective Measures Yet to Rescue Financial Situation in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the rescue of the financial situation in Nanjing and the mediation of debt disputes between the silver and money industries, the silver and money industry associations and the city chamber of commerce still have no effective measures. In the banking industry, it is impossible to only lend out without recovering in order to maintain capital. Although the silver industry is the second creditor, the operations of various debtors are gradually declining, and it is difficult for those without rice to cook to fulfill the responsibilities of debtors, which has implicated the banking industry. If this continues, it will become an important problem for the two industries in Nanjing. Government authorities can hardly come up with rescue measures during this period of financial exhaustion. According to opinions in the financial community, the only way to remedy the situation at present is to enable the money shops to recover a large portion of the debts owed by the shops, so that the loans can be guaranteed, then the banking industry can postpone the collection of debts and the financial situation can still be turned around. Many in the money industry advocate using the real estate of each shop as collateral for bank loans, but this is also not easy to do, and the final outcome is difficult to predict.

<h3>Qinghai Inspection Team Leaves Shaanxi and Returns East</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) At 8 AM on the 19th, Gu Zhizhong, Huang Bokui, and Lu Yi of the Qinghai Inspection Team arrived here by plane from Lanzhou. On the 20th, they took a car to Tongguan and returned east. The other two team members, Wang Yang and Shu Yongkang, remained in Lanzhou to wait for a plane and are expected to depart around the 24th. According to Gu and others, the land in Qinghai is fertile and rich in mineral deposits. However, the military is too domineering, with excessive taxes and levies, and the people cannot bear it. The arbitrariness of Ma Bufang, the commander of the 9th Division, is especially well-known to the people of Qinghai. The various ethnic groups such as the Tibetans and Mongols encountered along the way earnestly asked when the central government would rescue them from their misery. If the feudal forces are not removed one day, all construction and development in Qinghai will be hopeless. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Issue of the Mongolian Salt Bureau Borrowing and Transporting Reed Salt</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has approved the request of the Kouxibei Mongolian Salt Bureau to borrow and transport reed salt, with a limit of 100,000 dan per year.

<p>Reuters Vienna, 19th - Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss flew to the port of Limini in central Italy this afternoon to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who is vacationing there. The Italian Prime Minister may allow him to continue to act as a peacemaker between Austria and Germany. According to a Reuters reporter in Rome, it is unreliable that the Italian Prime Minister will allow Dollfuss to strongly help him oppose Hitler. Before going to Limini, Dollfuss met with Hungarian Foreign Minister Di Gangi, who made contact. The Hungarian Foreign Minister must meet with the Italian Prime Minister in Italy, and he stopped in Austria on his way back home.</p>
<h3>Parting Words of French Pro-Japanese Minister Marte</h3>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 19th - Outgoing French Ambassador to Japan Marte, who has now been appointed as the Commissioner for Syria, made a few remarks to reporters on the eve of his departure, stating that the main task of his mission in Japan was to actively negotiate the Franco-Japanese trade agreement on Vietnam and to place Franco-Japanese cultural exchanges on a more solid foundation. Now he is eager to return home because he needs to discuss everything with his predecessor as Commissioner for Syria, now the Governor of Morocco, in Paris. The trade agreement between Japan and Vietnam, which was signed in Paris last year, stipulates the free exchange of certain goods between Vietnam and Japan. As for cultural affairs between France and Japan, methods were formulated two years ago. Japanese university students who are jointly examined by the Franco-Japanese Committee can enjoy scholarship benefits in France. This method has been implemented for two years and has been able to encourage Japanese students to study French. The Japanese side said that the Franco-Japanese trade agreement was signed at a time when the situation in the Far East was extremely tense, which shows the French government's friendly attitude towards Japan.</p>

<h3>Japan's Instructions for the Japan-India Conference</h3>
<p>Nikkei Rengo Tokyo, 20th - The vice-ministers' conference of the six ministries decided yesterday on the draft instructions for Representative Sawada to take to the Simla Conference. The content is as follows: (1) Maintain Japan's trade with India so that India understands the trade war that will occur after the abolition of the Japan-India Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the disadvantages caused to both countries; (2) Countermeasures to deal with the conference, maintain full flexibility, and leave room for consideration. The above two items are the fundamental spirit. Other temporary and changeable guidelines are as follows: (1) In Japan-India negotiations, demand unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. However, the conclusion of Japan-India treaties shall be based on reciprocity; (2) Japan shall implement export controls for the Indian market based on the agreement on quantity issues to prevent market disruption, and India should reduce the current high tariff rate of 75%; (3) Japan will also implement controls on the export of general merchandise, and India will not impose differential tariffs on this; (4) Regarding the rayon issue, Japan is unwilling to make it a conference agenda item, but if the British and Indian sides actively request discussion, the Japanese side is also prepared to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Cuba Still Unrestful</h3>
<p>Guomin Havana, 19th - Disturbances broke out again in the capital of Cuba today. Several strikebreakers wanted to take the positions of dockworkers, resulting in a major conflict with the dockworkers, killing two strikebreakers. They were later dispersed by the police. A team of civilians from the anti-Machado faction wanted to rush into the Principe Fortress to kill the former Minister of the Interior, Chairetai, who was imprisoned there. Fortunately, the army lined up to surround and protect the fortress, and the civilians dispersed. Aenka, the police chief of the Machado government and one of the leaders of the vinegar officials, committed suicide today out of fear of being hunted down by the people.</p>
<h3>Indian Government to Release Gandhi from Prison</h3>
<p>Reuters Pune, 19th - Gandhi's hunger strike will not cause the Indian government to make repeated concessions. However, a Reuters reporter learned that the government may release Gandhi from prison when he becomes ill from the hunger strike. At the same time, government doctors are now carefully examining his health and plan to mediate. Mr. Andrews visited Gandhi in prison today after meeting with the authorities in Mumbai. According to the report, the Mahatma is on hunger strike in prison to protest because he does not have sufficient facilities to carry out his movement to liberate the untouchables.</p>
<p>Havas, 20th Mumbai, India - Since being sentenced to one year in prison and entering Yerovda Prison, Gandhi is now planning "to fast to death." It is generally believed that the government plans to release Gandhi when he fasts to the point of unconsciousness. The reason is that the Indian people were quite surprised when they first heard that Gandhi was fasting to death, but now they understand everything, so they firmly demand that Gandhi's life not be put in danger. As for Gandhi, he believes that the "Poona Agreement" signed after his second hunger strike was intended to improve the status of the untouchable class on the issue of elections, but now the government is trying to gradually undermine it. Therefore, he really has the right to conduct pure social propaganda to benefit the lower classes. This kind of right is fundamental and should not be denied. Furthermore, it is rumored here that the deep hatred between Gandhi and the Governor-General of India, Wellington, and several senior officials is also the reason why the current deadlock is not easy to resolve.</p>

<h3>Western Newspaper Reports on Japan's Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>The effectiveness of airplanes and their role in future wars has been fully demonstrated since the September 18th Incident. However, the development of Japan's aviation industry has only occurred in the last decade or so.  It is only due to the enthusiastic promotion by both the government and the public that it has made rapid progress and achieved its current success.  At this moment, what stage has Japan's military and commercial aviation industry reached, and what are the reasons for its success?  During this period of national aviation salvation, it is believed that this is not only what the Chinese people urgently want to know, but it also provides valuable lessons for us.  The "North-China Daily News" published a detailed report from Tokyo on the development of Japan's aviation industry and its pursuit of excellence.  I have translated it as follows:</p>
<p>According to the report, "Japan's attention to aviation is relatively recent. When the Wright brothers, Blériot, and other British pioneers were experimenting with airplanes, the Japanese were not interested in following suit, thinking that observing the results would be sufficient. It was not until 1910 that the first successful test flight took place. At that time, Lieutenant Tokugawa, along with another officer, was sent to France to study aviation. They purchased a 50-horsepower airplane from France and flew it nearly two miles, earning praise from the nation. At that time, Western countries had already made long-distance flights, and some had even attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Here, we have something to note: before the European War, although Germany was known worldwide for its advanced military equipment, the Japanese never went to Germany to study aviation before the war. However, after Tokugawa's successful demonstration, Japanese military personnel clearly saw the potential of this new type of weapon in warfare, and a craze for aviation activities began.  Army airfield was established at Tokorozawa and a naval aviation port was established near the Yokosuka Arsenal. However, it was not until the European War that Japan was able to establish an air force and make significant progress."</p>
<p>"Before 1914, Japan relied entirely on Europe and the United States for airplanes and engines. When the war entered its second or third year, Europe had a great need for airplanes and cut off exports. Therefore, the Japanese began to manufacture their own, disassembling and imitating those purchased from Europe and the United States. Although the engines produced at that time did not operate very well, they could still be assembled into airplanes and flown. When the European War ended, airplanes could once again be imported from abroad, but the Japanese decided to strive for self-sufficiency in military supplies and intensified their research. At that time, the Japanese only viewed airplanes as tools for combat and had not yet considered other uses. The primary goal of Japanese airplane manufacturing companies at that time was to obtain drawings used in Europe. As a result, companies from Germany and the Netherlands were the first to sell drawings and send technicians to Japan to assist in manufacturing and assembly. Later, in 1919, the Japanese military requested the French General Staff to send aviation specialists to Japan to provide guidance and training. Subsequently, the Japanese Navy invited British naval training officers to help train its naval air force."</p>
<p>"At the same time, the Japanese also began to pay attention to commercial aviation. The Japanese government vigorously encouraged it and provided generous subsidies. The Japanese news media also vigorously promoted civil aviation, not only doing their best to promote and publicize it, but also taking the lead themselves. Almost all major newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka owned airplanes, which they often used to take photos and transmit news, promoting their effectiveness. For example, after the Great Earthquake of 1923, when transportation between Tokyo and other places was cut off, the airplanes of various newspapers were engaged in reporting and other useful work. The four newspapers, "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun," "Asahi Shimbun," "Hochi Shimbun," and "Jiji Shimpō," had fierce competition in this area. Two airplanes of the "Asahi Shimbun" traveled from Tokyo to Rome via Siberia in 1925. The "Hochi Shimbun" attempted to fly across the Pacific Ocean twice, but unfortunately failed."</p>
<p>"Today, the Japanese Air Force has become a powerful military force. Since the Manchurian Incident, the aviation fever throughout the country has increased daily. Airplanes fly back and forth in the skies of major cities. Frenzied propaganda can be seen in newspapers, on platforms, in movie clips, and even in front of pulpits. In total, there are more than 30 factories in Japan today that manufacture airplanes and their accessories. During the Shanghai Battle and in the months that followed, these factories were said to have been operating day and night to rush production."</p>
<p>"Mitsubishi's airplane manufacturing plant in Nagoya covers 59 acres and employs over 3,000 workers. The scale of this plant gives some indication of the current state. Today, Japanese airplane factories are gradually focusing all their efforts on manufacturing Japanese airplanes, and most of the airplanes produced are pursuit planes and fighter planes. As for reconnaissance planes, the work has not yet been perfected. However, Japanese airplane manufacturing companies are now doing their best to manufacture 'warplanes.' Several of these warplanes, which are imitations of foreign models, have already been used in Manchuria. However, the military authorities feel that these airplanes can only be used for military marches in Manchuria because airplanes can roam freely in that area and even if they encounter resistance, it is very weak. The airplanes used to bomb Zhabei during the Shanghai Battle included many purchased from abroad, but some were also manufactured by two or three major airplane factories here, which were imitated from foreign models and directly supervised by the Ministry of the Army. This is somewhat of an open secret. In Japan, it is impossible to investigate ordinary facts about airplane manufacturing or events about air defense. When you ask questions, the answerer is extremely humble, but in an instant, they suddenly become hesitant and say that they do not speak English, even though they were just speaking fluent English a few minutes ago. This is because they are afraid that people will discover their secrets, so they pretend to be this way. Japan's commercial aviation business is mostly controlled by Japan Air Transport Corporation. Since its establishment, it has not only achieved remarkable results, but it is also comparable to any country. The company operates scheduled flights from Tokyo to Fukuoka (southern Japan) via Osaka, and it also passes through Dalian and extends to Korea. Since the establishment of 'Manchukuo,' Japan has enjoyed great convenience, so this air route has been extended to Harbin, passing through major cities in Manchuria and reaching Qiqihar. The Manchurian route is sometimes called the Japan-Manchukuo Air Transport Corporation, but it is actually an extension of the business of the existing Japan Air Transport Corporation. The land and naval forces of Japan today are showing a vigorous appearance due to the great expansion of aerial weapons. Both the army and navy recognize that the Japanese Air Force is inferior to those of the United States and Britain. The naval community in particular is very concerned, saying that the naval ratio of Japan is smaller than its needs, and the disarmament conference has rejected Japan's view that aircraft carriers are defensive weapons. Therefore, it is an urgent matter for Japan to establish a larger air force. It is difficult to get an exact number of how many commercial and military airplanes Japan has today. It is estimated that the number is around 900."</p>
<p>"After the September 18th Incident, incidents occurred repeatedly, and a war fever swept the country. As a result, the public donated money to purchase airplanes to assist the army, calling them patriotic airplanes. These included reconnaissance planes, light bomber planes, and ambulance planes. It is estimated that about 100 airplanes were purchased by wealthy individuals or public donations to assist the army, and most of them were used in Manchuria. Whenever such a patriotic airplane was named, many people would hold a grand religious ceremony. There is a very large research institute for aviation technology in Tokyo today. It is said that its scale and precision are among the best in the world. The institute occupies 14 acres and has a specially constructed wind tunnel and other valuable equipment. No one seems to know what its purpose is, but it can be said that its ultimate goal is to make Japan's scientific exploration of the aviation industry independent of the West. Japan expects to invent seaplanes, and the institute is eager to make inventions in aviation. Japan has never lacked England's when it has made a sound, other countries also make it, great enthusiasm creates heroes, but I don't know if enthusiasm is useful for the invention of machinery?"</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Reorganizing the Troops in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>Feng Fang's troops still number 60,000 to 70,000. There are even more miscellaneous troops. It is very difficult to resolve the reorganization of various armies. Special dispatch from Zhangjiakou. When Feng was in Chahar, he appointed as many as 37 army commanders and 56 division commanders. The remaining had all kinds of names. The total number of people was no less than 150,000. It is conceivable that the internal structure was complex after assembling so many miscellaneous troops in such a short period of time. After the recovery of Dolon, it was originally intended to concentrate forces and advance towards Rehe again. Tang Yulin, Cui Xingwu, Yu Zhishan, and other departments were also contacted. However, the environment was becoming more and more pressing. The Japanese army increased its troops in western Rehe, and the situation became tense. At the same time, the situation in the southern section of the Ping-Sui Railway changed drastically. Attacked from inside and outside, the troops sent to the Dagu area gradually moved south, and the plan to enter Rehe was abandoned. As for external development, the situation restricted it and it was impossible. As a result, these tens of thousands of hungry troops, due to financial difficulties and lack of pay, could not be maintained, and became the most difficult problem to solve at present. At the beginning of Feng's uprising, all parties provided some assistance, which was sufficient for one month. Later, the number of troops gathered increased day by day, but the assistance from all parties did not continue. As a result, they had to seek supplies from the local area. How could the local people bear this heavy burden under the depression of all industries? It was only natural that the military and the people were in distress. In the end, the Ping-Sui Railway was cut off, and an economic blockade made the situation even more difficult. However, although Feng left, the troops he had collected were all stationed outside the Pass without any losses. How to deal with the aftermath is a general concern. According to an investigation, the troops currently retreating to the Zhangbei, Kangbao, and Dagu areas include more than 10,000 newly recruited troops under Fang Zhenwu in the Zhangbei area, more than 5,000 men of Sun Liangcheng's Vanguard Army, 3,000 men of Zhang Yunrong's unit, more than 10,000 men of Ji Hongchang's Northern Route Army in the Dolon and Kangbao area, more than 2,000 men of Zhang Lingyun's unit, more than 10,000 men of Zhang Lisheng's Self-Defense Army, more than 10,000 men of Deng Wen's old unit stationed in the Wanquan area, more than 5,000 men of Li Zhongyi's unit, and Zhang Renjie's unit, which has now expanded to more than 10,000 men and is stationed in the Gaoxuezhuang area. In addition, Liu Guitang's unit still has more than 10,000 men stationed in Guyuan, Chicheng, and Longguan. The above armies have about 60,000 to 70,000 people, not counting the miscellaneous parts. At present, the central government plans to reorganize Zhang Renjie's unit into a brigade. Deng Wen's old unit and the units of Li Zhongyi and Liu Zhendong will be restored to their original organization. Deng's unit will be reorganized into the 10th Division, Li Zhongyi's unit will be the 24th Brigade, and Liu Zhendong's unit will be reorganized into the 25th Cavalry Brigade. No arrangements have yet been decided for the units of Fang Zhenwu, Sun Liangcheng, Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yunrong, and Liu Guitang. The armies are still flying the banner of resisting Japan. More than 2,700 men of Liu Zhendong's unit have all been transferred to Xuanhua for reorganization under the command of Pang Bingxun. Liu himself is currently in Zhangyuan and will arrive in Xuanhua within days to reorganize his unit. Although Deng's and Li's units have received orders, they have not prepared for reorganization. The internal structure of each army is complex and the nature is different. There will be many problems in the reorganization in the future. Seeing the difficulty of the aftermath, Song Zheyuan stated that he would only be responsible for resolving disputes and maintaining the status quo, and that the reorganization and aftermath would be left to the central government. The central government entrusted Song with the responsibility of reorganizing Feng's unit. What will happen in the future will depend on the results of Song's discussion in Peiping. In addition, after Zheng Guilin's unit rebelled in Machang, it fled north across the Ping-Han Railway and has now reached Yixian in Chahar, with more than 1,000 men still there. The unit still claims to resist Japan. How to deal with it is also a problem. (August 16)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang's Army Occupies the Min River Line</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang's army has more than 120 regiments. Liu Wenhui relies on the river to divide and defend each section. In continuous fierce battles, Liu Wenhui retreats to Ya'an. Correspondent from Chongqing. After Liu Wenhui left Chengdu, all of his troops gradually moved west of the Min River. Liu himself was stationed in Xinjin. Later, Liu Xiang's airplanes came to Xinjin from time to time to drop bombs, so he moved to Qionglai. Currently, he has moved from Qionglai to Ya'an. Military supplies are also completely concentrated in Ya'an. However, after retreating to the Min River, the territory has shrunk compared to before, and funds are becoming increasingly strained. The temporary pre-collection of taxes in various counties has exceeded 70 years of the Republic of China, and many of the officers of the unit are also automatically collecting taxes from the people. In the counties in southern Sichuan, the local people are poor, and now there is a sudden increase of 70,000 to 80,000 troops. The issue of food is the most problematic. The generals of the army, fearing that there would be no funds and worried about the lack of bullets, mostly advocated retreating to Liu Xiang to preserve their strength. Huang Ao, Liu Jifu, Tian Boshi, and others, respectively, persuaded Liu Wenhui. Liu, seeing that the general trend was over, decided to step down. Later, due to automatic writing, he obtained the words "deeply rooted, waiting for the coming spring," and decided to continue struggling. He ordered the entire army to defend to the death along the Min River. Liu Xiang repeatedly wanted Liu Wenhui's troops to retreat to Xikang to end the civil war, but Liu Wenhui believed that Xikang was remote and had limited tax revenue, and the climate was not good, so the officers and soldiers were unwilling. Therefore, although there was a proposal to retreat to Baoning, Yaan, and other counties and Xikang when necessary, the first step was to defend the Min River to the death. If the Min River could not be defended, they would take the route through Emei, Ebian, and Pingshan counties, cross the Jinsha River, retreat into Yunnan, and try to unite with Wang Jialie's troops and ask for support from Guangdong and Guangxi in order to make a comeback. If this route was not possible, they would take the route from Ningyuan and Yaan through Xichang and Huili to enter Xikang. Liu Wenhui also repeatedly sent urgent messages to Wang Jingwei, asking Wang to find a way to stop Liu Xiang and others from attacking. He also repeatedly asked Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others for help in the southwest, and sent Chief of Staff Zhu Jishen to Yunnan and Li and others to Guizhou to discuss everything. However, there were great undercurrents within Liu Wenhui's army, and it was difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang decided to thoroughly resolve the issue with Liu Wenhui and said that he would only allow Liu Wenhui to keep two divisions and send them to Xikang. In recent days, Liu Xiang has ordered his armies to deploy along the Min River to launch an offensive. The deployment is still divided into three routes: east, north, and south. 1. The Northern Route is Deng Xihou's army, with three divisions, from Guanxian, Dujiangyan to Xiejiabridge in Pixian, led by Huang Yimin of the Second Division. Wenjiang and Chuanxindian are led by Ma Dezhai of the Seventh Division. From Chuanxindian to Caierchang in Shuangliu is led by Chen Shunong's unit of the Third Division. Deng's Fifth Mixed Brigade, led by Xie Decan, is in the Caieryan area. Deng Xihou has gone from the province to the front line to command military affairs. 2. The Eastern Route is Li Qixiang with eight regiments, Luo Zezhou with five regiments, and Liu Xiang with the Model Division's Jiang and He brigades and Deng Guozhang, the commander of the Second Route of the Border Defense, to assist, with Li Qixiang as the commander-in-chief and Luo Zezhou as his deputy. 3. The Southern Route is from Jiading to Xinjin, which is entirely responsible for Liu Xiang's army. It includes Liu's First and Second Routes, the Training Division, the Garrison First and Second Commands, and the border defense troops of Chen Lanting and others. In total, the three routes have more than 120 regiments, in addition to Liu Xiang's air force and public security fleet, with great fighting power.</p>
<p>The military deployment of Liu Wenhui's side has changed slightly compared to before. The Xu's bridge from Dujiangyan to Guanxian is guarded by the First and Second Guard Brigades and Liu Yuantang's 12th Brigade. Zhang Qingping's division originally guarded Chongqing and has now been transferred to Xinjin and Pengshan. From Chongqing to the Jinma River along the river is guarded by the First and Second Divisions of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense. Chen Hongwen's unit was transferred from Chongqing to Dase. The Jiading and Meishan areas are guarded by Xia Zhongshi and Leng Nanxun's divisions and other units. As for their responsibilities, the Xinjin and Chongqing areas are commanded by the three division commanders Chen Hongwen, Wang Yuanhu, and Deng He, with a total strength of about 20 regiments. From Xinjin to Pengshan, Tang Ying, Xu Guangpu, and other units are responsible, with a strength of about 10 regiments. From Pengshan to Qingshen, the Fourth Division of Sichuan-Kang, Leng Yindong, and Zhang Zhihe's units are responsible. From Qingshen to Meizhou, the two division commanders Lin Yungen and Xia Zhongshi are responsible. In total, the strength from Pengshan to Meizhou is particularly increased because of the main force of Liu Xiang's army, with more than 30 regiments. Liu Wenhui also installed mines in the Min River and divided the 600-mile stretch along the river into six major sections and twenty minor sections. Each major section is 100 miles, and each minor section is 30 miles. The entire army is deployed along the coast, with a total of 60 regiments. Each major section is responsible for one route, and each minor section is responsible for one brigade. Regarding supplies, Liu Wenhui contributed most of his personal wealth to reward the troops for their efforts.</p>
<p>On the 10th, the allied armies of Liu Xiang began to attack Liu Wenhui's army. In the fierce fighting until the 12th, Xinjin was occupied by Liu Xiang's army. Liu Wenhui had no choice but to send another telegram to Liu Xiang to make peace, and sent Leng Yindong and Wen Xindao as representatives to the province to discuss everything, but to no avail. At the same time, Liu Wenhui also sent telegrams to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, proposing three points: 1. Give him the title of Commander-in-Chief or Supervisor of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense. 2. Preserve the existing defense area on the west bank of the Min River. 3. His troops can be transferred to Jiangxi to suppress bandits. On the 13th, the fighting became more intense. Liu Xiang believed that Liu Wenhui's army was defending the river to the death, making it difficult to attack. In addition to sending three airplanes to bomb along the coast, he also organized 20 regiments of daredevils and distributed them to Tonghe, Sandukou, Shuijiangkou, Chenjiadu, and other places to launch fierce crossings. Peng Chengfu's brigade of Liu Wenhui's unit suddenly gave up the Haba embankment first. Shi Zezhou's brigade could not resist later. Deng Xihou's unit occupied Shiyangchang. Li Jianming, the Chief of Staff of Liu Xiang's army, led the Liao Haitao and Meng Haoran brigades and artillery units, attacked from the Haba embankment, passed through Liuzijie, and occupied Chongqing. The divisions of Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, Pan Wenhua, and Tang Shizun crossed the river separately. Pan's division occupied Meishan on the 15th, Fan Ziying's brigade occupied Qingshen, and Wang Zhiyi's division occupied Jiading. Liu Wenhui, seeing that the Min River had been lost, could no longer fight and concentrated his remaining troops in Ya'an, still trying to defend to the death. However, Liu Xiang issued an order on the 15th, limiting one week to thoroughly resolve Liu Wenhui in order to end the Min River military affairs. (August 17)</p>
<h3>Half of the Counties in Western Shandong Become Waterlogged</h3>
<p>The Cries of the Disaster Victims Shake the Wilderness</p>
<p>Please Assist with Disaster Relief and Prevention Efforts</p>
<p>Correspondent from Jinan. After the Yellow River breached in Henan and Hebei, the river water flowed horizontally in the counties of western Shandong. Wherever it passed, the fields and houses were gone. The disaster area is expanding. The water from Shitouzhuang on the north bank is flowing past Shou Zhang South Pass and is pouring in. The water level in Fan County upstream continues to rise, and all sections of the dangerous projects are under pressure at the same time. The water south of the Jin Dike is more than 40 miles wide, and the water depth on the flat ground is two meters, a vast expanse of water. Zhou Junying, the magistrate of the county, has mobilized more than 2,300 civilians to rush to block the dangerous projects. According to a telegram from Zhang Wenwei, the magistrate of Juye County, the water on the south bank has reached the county seat, with a depth of five inches and a width of six or seven miles. The county is dredging the water to divert the Yellow River into the Shu River in order to reduce the water force. In Heze, Cao County, and Shan County, the water is also overflowing in all directions. The disaster victims in various counties are gathered in the county seat, and the cries shake the wilderness. There is a severe shortage of food in the county seats. Sun Zeren, the magistrate of Heze County, in addition to organizing a relief association, has also telegraphed to request the continued issuance of large sums of money for disaster relief. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, believes that the Jin Dike has not seen water for a long time, and the dike body is short. If the water level rises again, the river water will overflow and break, and there will be no survivors in the counties of western Shandong. Therefore, he has sent telegrams to the relevant counties, urging them to quickly raise the dike body to provide defense. He has also reported to the provincial government and will go to Fan County, Shou Zhang, Yanggu, and other counties upstream this morning (18th) to inspect and supervise the construction and repair.</p>
<p>Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, in addition to appealing to the central government for disaster relief for the disaster victims in western Shandong, has also sent Zhao Yunxie, a counselor from the provincial government, to western Shandong to investigate the disaster. He has also sent a commissioner to carry four or five thousand yuan to Shou Zhang for emergency relief. He has also sent an armored vehicle to Jinning at 4:00 pm today to pick up the refugees to Jinan for temporary shelter. Han's intention is to save lives as the first priority. In the past two days, Han has re-telegraphed the National Government to report the disaster and request funds for disaster relief. The text is as follows: 1. Respectfully to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Committee at Guling, and respect to the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing, I have repeatedly telegraphed to report on the situation of the floods in the counties of western Shandong. According to the River Affairs Bureau and the county governments of Pu, Fan, and other counties, the Yellow River breached at Shitouzhuang in Changyuan County, Hebei, and the water flows downstream along the Jin Dike and the southern channel, and the momentum is very strong. At 9:00 am on the 18th, it poured into the northeast of Hezhai in Pu County. Currently, the water depth north of the county seat, south of the Jin Dike, is about one foot and the width is more than three miles. In the area around Chaolou Village in the northwest, the water depth is seven or eight feet. At this time of the 17th, it reached the territory of Fan County. The water outside the south gate of the city along the river dike is one or two fathoms deep and about four or five miles wide. In the afternoon, it rose more than one foot. The area south of the Jin Dike to the Yellow River levee is about thirty or forty miles wide and has become a swamp. At 19th, it flowed into Shou Zhang, with a water depth of about one fathom and a width of several miles, and is still rising. In addition to ordering the disaster-stricken counties to do their best to step up the prevention and rescue, I respectfully telegraph this to the National government. Respectfully, Han Fuju (Seal). 2. Respectfully to Chairman Lin of the National Government, the Yellow River breach this time has caused a serious disaster. The tragic situation has been repeatedly telegraphed. Now, according to an urgent telegram from the Cao eight counties River workers' Association, two places on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan have breached, rushing directly to western Shandong. The water is surging, the water depth on the flat ground is six or seven feet, the grain is washed away, and the disaster victims are starving and waiting for rescue. We urge you to quickly allocate funds for emergency relief. At the same time, according to a telegram from the Heze County Government, the Yellow River is overflowing in the fields, the water outside the city moat is more than one fathom deep, and the troops and civilians in the city are all defending the dike. Looking from the dike, houses collapse from time to time, and people and animals die. Some who escape are naked and homeless, and women and children are crying. The severity of the disaster has not been seen in decades. We urge you to provide relief to save the people's lives. Although I have ordered the county governments to do their best to find ways to transfer funds for relief, this is a drop in the bucket and not enough to alleviate the disaster. I have always admired you in your concern for the people. Please consider the starvation of millions of people and quickly allocate huge sums of money for emergency relief so that the people who have suffered this disaster can celebrate their rebirth. I am deeply grateful and await your orders. I respectfully telegraph and urge you, and await your great assistance. Respectfully, Han Fuju (Seal), also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, with similar wording.</p>
<p>Fellow villagers from the Cao region in Jinan held a meeting at Huangting in the city today (18th). Representatives from Guancheng, Fan County, Yanggu, Shou Zhang on the north bank and Shan County, Cao County, Heze, Dingtao, Chengwu, Juye, and Yucheng on the south bank attended. Zhu Jinggu presided over the meeting and decided to 1. Organize a Yellow River flood emergency relief association in the counties of western Shandong. 2. The emergency relief association will be divided into two sections, documents and investigation, to handle affairs. Wang Ziyu was elected as the director of documents, and Hu Xueji was elected as the director of investigation. 3. Send representatives to appeal to the central and provincial governments for disaster relief. 4. Ask the provincial government to exempt the head tax. 5. Ask the telegraph bureau to provide free disaster reporting telegrams to facilitate publicity. In addition, all the counties in Cao region have appointed committee members to handle the association's affairs and will hold another meeting to elect standing committee members. (August 18)</p>
<h3>Discovery of Relics in Pingyuan County</h3>
<p>And Several Types of Porcelain from the Song Dynasty</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that in March and April of this spring, an ancient tomb from the Song Dynasty was discovered in De County, Northern Shandong Province. It was the place where the relics of the monks of Yongqing Temple during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty were buried. The relics, considered supreme by Buddhists, amounted to about one liter when discovered. Subsequently, they were transported to the Shandong Provincial Library in Jinan for preservation. Recently, the Civil Affairs Department received a report from Cao Mengjiu, the magistrate of Pingyuan County in Northern Shandong, stating that there was a dilapidated pagoda in the western suburbs of the county. On the eleventh day of the month, a resident of the county was digging soil in front of the pagoda and discovered a well-like hole. He entered to investigate and found two stone troughs, a monk's hat, a white porcelain bowl, a small white porcelain bottle, a small glass gourd, and a package of pebbles (i.e., relics). Based on the location and the style of the artifacts, it is speculated that this incident is related to the discovery in De County. Li Shuchun, the head of the Civil Affairs Department, has ordered the county to properly preserve the artifacts and has dispatched a committee to investigate the county. It is planned to transport the artifacts to Jinan for preservation in the library. (Eighteenth day)</p>

<h3>Locust Plague Spreads in Coastal Areas</h3>
<p>Previously, a small number of locusts were found in the coastal villages of the first, fourth, and fifth districts. The county government was notified and, together with the village chiefs, led the farmers to implement capture measures. The government also provided funds for purchasing locusts, so the villagers were quite enthusiastic about the work of catching locusts. The locust plague seemed to be gradually disappearing. Unexpectedly, in recent days, many rice fields in these districts have been found infested with locust nymphs, spreading extensively. Although the usual capture methods are still being employed, it is difficult to eliminate them immediately, resulting in daily damage to rice and cotton crops. A poor harvest is feared this autumn.</p>

<h3>Another Criminal Apprehended in Huayang Murder Case</h3>
<p>During a heavy rain on the evening of June 19th, Xi Yongda Rice Shop at Huayang Bridge, and the chairman Xi Weiquan and his wife, were shot and robbed by bandits, shocking the society. The county government strictly ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team to apprehend the culprits and punish them. After purchasing leads and conducting investigations, Yang Shijie of the Public Security Bureau apprehended a Xu Guanxiang. According to his confession, the case was planned by a Jiang, and he only knew about the incident but did not participate. It was also revealed that Zhuang was having an affair with Song Xiaomei, the concubine of the deceased's younger brother, Xi Weisheng. Xi Weisheng's family was far less well-off than his elder brother, and he had previously lost a lawsuit in the county government. After the tragic death of Xi Weiquan, there was widespread suspicion that it was a family tragedy. The county government issued a hand order to the County Public Security Bureau to arrest Xi Weisheng and his concubine Song Xiaomei for interrogation. Xu Guanxiang identified Song Xiaomei as having contacted Jiang at the Gongping Hotel in Shanghai twice. Song and the others vehemently denied the accusations. They were then handed over to the Prosecutor's Office of the County Court for interrogation and detention. Prosecutor Zhu personally went to the Xi family at Huayang Bridge to collect evidence. It is scheduled to continue the interrogation on the morning of the 22nd, and Xie Zhicheng will be summoned to testify. Yesterday, Fei Gongxia, an inspector of the Water Patrol Team, arrested Wu Zixiang. According to his confession, there was also a handgun and two kidnapping victims hidden somewhere. Fei escorted the suspect to retrieve the gun aboard a patrol boat. It is rumored that the suspect has underworld connections, so the authorities are paying close attention. If the main culprit is identified, the mystery of the case will not be difficult to unravel. It is expected that Wu will be able to return to Songjiang with the gun around the same day.</p>

<h3>Attempted Suicide After Failing to Find Relatives</h3>
<p>Suicide is becoming increasingly prevalent in our city. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, a young man was seen on Tonglu Road inside Guangfu Gate, dressed in a blue checkered cotton western-style shirt, white cloth shorts, black gauze socks, and gray sneakers, appearing very distraught. He was pacing back and forth, repeatedly asking passersby for directions to a pharmacy. Zhang Xinlan, the guard on duty, found his behavior suspicious and followed him secretly. She then saw the young man walk to the riverside in the public enclosure, standing and gazing down, sighing and lamenting. Zhang, seeing this, immediately stepped forward to interrogate him. He claimed his name was Mei Qiuming, from Hankou, and was seventeen years old. He had come to Wuxi to visit relatives but failed to find them and intended to commit suicide by drowning. Zhang brought him to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Officer Qin opened the court, and Mei presented a suicide note, stating that his parents had passed away and he was living with his uncle. He was unable to continue his studies and had come to Wuxi to visit relatives but was unable to find them, so he planned to commit suicide. As a result, the court instructed him to await disposition from the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Incite Rickshaw Pullers to Strike Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>There are a total of 2,214 rickshaws in our county. The originally stipulated rental fee was $0.37 per vehicle. Due to the social and economic panic last year and the sluggish business, the rental price could not be implemented. Each rickshaw company secretly reduced the rental fee due to business reasons, ranging from 600 to 1,000 copper coins per vehicle, to maintain their business. Starting in June of this year, the owners of the rickshaw companies decided to restore the original price of $0.37. After learning about this, all the rickshaw pullers went on strike on August 6th. After persuasion from both the government and other parties, they resumed work on the 8th. County Magistrate Yan summoned representatives from the County Party Headquarters, the First District Office, and the Rickshaw Industry Association to a meeting at the county government, where it was decided that the rental fee per vehicle per day would range from 850 to 1,000 copper coins, effective from August 16th. At that time, the rickshaw pullers again threatened to strike a second time, but fortunately, preventive measures were taken and they immediately resumed work. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 19th, reactionary leaflets suddenly appeared in society, inciting the rickshaw pullers to strike on the 20th, creating a tense situation. After learning about this, County Magistrate Yan immediately summoned the executive committee members of the Rickshaw Industry Association to the county government for talks, instructing them to inform each rickshaw company to take proper precautions and continue to rent out vehicles as usual. At the same time, he ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade to strictly guard against and investigate the matter. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau secretly dispatched plainclothes detectives to investigate. The heads of the Public Security Branches also ordered the night-shift guards to be on duty, and armed double posts were added to the important streets. After dawn, it was discovered that some unscrupulous rickshaw pullers were watching and refusing to rent vehicles, hoping to cause trouble. However, police officers were stationed every hundred steps and guards every fifty steps to monitor their actions. Off-duty police officers patrolled the area, and the heads of the Public Security Branches also went out to check on the patrols. The off-duty police officers were still holding flashlights, showing that they had not slept a wink. The Police Brigade patrolled the areas without police posts. After 8:00 AM, they all dispersed and returned. The serious situation of the rickshaw pullers' third strike was safely overcome and did not materialize, which is truly fortunate for the region.</p>

<h3>Excellent Autumn Silkworm Production</h3>
<p>Since our county was designated as a silkworm breeding model area by the Jiangsu Real Estate Bureau last spring, the director and deputy director, Qi Lunjie (Magistrate of Jintan County) and Zhu Xinyu, have been actively working on improvements. Excellent results were already achieved last year. This spring, a strict policy of uniform breed was implemented, with even more remarkable results. On average, each sheet of silkworm eggs produces about 40 catties of cocoons. Each sheet of autumn silkworm eggs yields 8 jiao in cash. The original order was for 13,000 sheets, but as the farmers' interest in silkworm breeding far exceeded previous years, the directors added 7,400 sheets at a higher price, still selling them at 8 jiao. The farmers heard that all 20,400 sheets of silkworm eggs were of the 300X Xiyuan breed and were sold out in full on the 13th and 14th of this month. There are a total of 14 guidance centers in the county's silkworm farming development area, with 32 assigned instructors. The period from July 26th to August 12th was the general disinfection period. Currently, they are working hard to guide the collection of silkworm ants. In addition to the instructors' circuit guidance for farmers raising autumn silkworms, the model area also prints and distributes publicity materials to farmers for reference, to compensate for the inadequacy of guidance. The mulberry leaves in Jintan have been developing very well this autumn, and the climate has also been mild recently. The future results are expected to be good.</p>

<p>In Shenjiazhuang, about four li away from the city, there is a Zhou Yushi family, who are well-off. Last night, eight robbers suddenly broke into their house, armed with guns. They tied up Zhou while he was still asleep. His wife took the opportunity to escape but was caught by the robber on watch and tied to a wooden stake. They then began to ransack the house, which lasted for an hour. They stole 30 silver dollars, 30 bolts of coarse cloth, 5 leather jackets, 3 pairs of gold and jade bracelets, 5 pairs of silver bracelets, and many other items of clothing, totaling six large packages. Before leaving, they smashed Zhou's head with a gun, causing him to lose consciousness. The victim has reported the case to the county to pursue the robbers.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Occurs at Temple Fair</h3>
<p>August 14th of the lunar calendar is said to be the birthday of the Thunder God. On this day, the Taoist temple of Guandi in Guojiayuan, Shizhuang District, held a temple fair. People from far and near came to offer incense. A spice shop named Jiang Taixiang in the area invited relatives to their home to stay for the busy festival season. That morning, Wang Xiang from Wangjiagang sent his grandson by cart to take two children to the temple to offer incense. Unexpectedly, while traveling on the bridge, the incense visitors were crowded. Suddenly, someone pushed Wang with force, causing two girls about ten years old on the bridge to fall into the river. Although many people tried to retrieve them, they were already dead. It is said that these two girls were the daughters of the relatives of the spice shop. The person who caused the accident has already escaped without a trace. The shop has sent Wang to the Public Security Substation for interrogation.</p>

<h3>County Government Apprehends Gao Yuchun</h3>
<p>The investigation of the county's grain transactions in Jiaxing has been completed. The amount of missing grain transaction silver in Jia County reached more than 40,000 yuan. Gao Yuchun, the former head of collection, fled in fear of punishment. In addition to sealing his property, the county government reported the results of the transaction investigation to the Finance Department for review. The Finance Department ordered the county to summon all relevant personnel for interrogation. County Magistrate Jiang summoned Song Lengru and others, who were in charge of the transaction, as well as the current acting head, Zhou Lianrui, for questioning. He ordered Song and others to provide bail, and Zhou Lianrui was detained. It has been many days, but Gao Yuchun has not been brought to justice. The issue of responsibility involves much evasion. Therefore, the county government issued an arrest warrant yesterday to bring him to justice as soon as possible and investigate according to the law.</p>

It is reported that Mr. Sun has telegraphed Mayor Wu, and will come to Shanghai at the end of this month. At the same time, the modification of the engine of Chen's Jiang Que will be completed within a week. At that time, the two will meet and discuss in detail the plan for the joint round-the-country flight. Zeng Yijing, the director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in this port, told reporters from the Guowen News Agency that the Jiang Feng aircraft made by the Naval Aircraft Plant in this port also has the possibility of long-distance flight or flying around the country, but the plant is responsible for manufacturing aircraft. If the Jiang Feng is added, pilots must be selected separately.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Visits Huang Fu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang to Visit Mogan Mountain for a Week of Rest, Returning to Shanghai to Meet Song Ziwen Committee Chairman Huang Fu of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, after arriving in Shanghai the day before, has been attending numerous social engagements. He plans to go to Hangzhou and then to Mogan Mountain for a short rest in the next day or two. He will return to Shanghai in a week to meet with Minister of Finance Song Ziwen and discuss financial issues in North China before going north again.

<h3>German Consul General Denies Receiving Threatening Letter</h3>
<p>Rumor Originated from a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that it was rumored in this port yesterday that the acting German Consul General Blancard had received a threatening letter from communists or opponents of the Hitler faction. However, Consul General Blancard told reporters last night that this was not the case and that no one in the consulate had received such a letter. It was also said that the consulate had been surrounded by patrolmen for protection, but this was denied by the police. It is now believed that the rumor originated from the fact that when representatives of the anti-war conference arrived in Shanghai, the police dispatched detectives to patrol the vicinity of the China Merchants Bureau pier to prevent demonstrations, and those who were unaware mistakenly thought that the German Consulate General was being protected, leading to the spread of rumors.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Publishes Views on Partnership System</h3>
<p>Reply to Accountant Pan Xulun's Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from accountant Pan Xulun stating that there were many malpractices in changing partnerships to shareholding liabilities, and advocating adding a chapter on unlimited liability companies to the Company Law to eliminate the malpractices. The Shanghai Grain, Oil and Cake Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association and five other trade associations jointly refuted this view, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the reform of the partnership system must be in line with the commercial situation in our country. Yesterday, the matter was submitted to the 45th Standing Committee meeting for discussion, which did not support the separate establishment of an unlimited liability company. The original reply to Pan is as follows: Respected Sir, I received your letter of July 27, stating that there are four malpractices and three difficulties in changing the partnership to a shareholding liability, and advocating adding a chapter on unlimited liability companies to the Company Law. You suggested keeping the provisions of the Civil Code on partnerships unchanged, for which I am very grateful. The matter was submitted to the 45th Standing Committee meeting for discussion, and it was generally agreed that the joint and several liability of partnerships has only been in place for the past few years. As for the two sections of your opinion, "The Four Malpractices" and "The Three Difficulties," both involve changing from joint and several to shareholding. Lenders may be afraid of insufficient protection and may hesitate to lend money, and operators may find it difficult to raise large amounts of money. However, why are partnerships historically more successful than companies? This level seems to be overconsidered. In addition, what your opinion "The Malpractice Two" worries about is that the names and addresses of partners and the amount of partnership are not made public, and creditors may suffer losses. The Chamber of Commerce has already prepared remedial measures, and the government will forward them to the Municipal Government through the Social Affairs Bureau for departmental review. In your opinion "The Reason Two," you also believe that it is difficult to enforce without a legal basis. In fact, partners, in order to determine the shareholding responsibility and avoid being implicated, will naturally act without being ordered once they understand the advantages and disadvantages, and there is no need for coercion. Therefore, if this move is implemented, then the worry of your opinion "The Malpractice One," that it is impossible to initiate lawsuits against individual partners, can be eliminated. The difficulties that your opinion "The Difficulty One" and "The Difficulty Two" are concerned about are not actual difficulties. The first point is that the legislative precedent does not have to be the same, which you have already acknowledged. The second point is that adding and deleting regulations to the Civil Code partnership and commercial custom is just the labor of the legislators. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce's opinion is to implement the spirit of the unlimited liability company in the partnership system, but without changing its name. If a separate unlimited liability company is established, and the joint and several liability system of partnerships remains unchanged, then all the partnership stores in the country cannot be changed to unlimited liability companies. To prove this, since the promulgation of the Company Law during the late Qing Dynasty, nearly 30 years ago, only a very small portion in the cities have changed to corporate organization. Adopting this suggestion can only resolve a small portion of the disputes, and most of the partnerships (that is, joint and several liability) cannot be resolved. It is better to reform the method of partnership than to start from scratch. The resolution was made based on this intention and replied to the file. The corresponding record file reply is hereby notified, please note.</p>

<h3>Low Silk Prices Lead Silk Manufacturers' Trade Association to Hold General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Changing to a Production-Based System Similar to Nanshi District; Principles Passed, Specific Measures to be Discussed After Drafting</p>
<p>Previously, silk factories in the city had increased production because of slightly better silk market conditions. Now, with futures deliveries due, they are encountering low market prices and excessive pickiness regarding the quality of the silk. Furthermore, labor disputes led to significant losses even after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, making it difficult to maintain operations. Factories in the Zhabei district requested the trade association to submit a resolution to the general meeting for relief measures. The association held a general meeting of its members at its headquarters on North Xizang Road at 4 PM yesterday. More than 50 representatives from various factories, including Zhang Peishen, were present and the meeting was chaired by Shen Huachen. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Difficulties for Merchants</h3>
<p>The silk industry's situation this year: When spring cocoons entered the market, overseas markets showed some activity, so prices gradually trended upward. Thus, when purchasing spring cocoons, all factories believed that the silk market would not fall again, especially because the United States abandoned the gold standard, strengthening their hope. However, in the past two months, silk prices remained weak, with market prices only around 800 yuan. But because the factories had purchased a lot of goods in the spring, they continued to operate normally to avoid interest losses and maintain the livelihood of their employees. However, recently, factories suffered significant losses as foreign merchants sold futures. The factories originally increased production because market prices were slightly better, so they did not hesitate to sell more futures. However, recently, whenever futures deliveries were due, foreign merchants, taking advantage of low market prices, often found fault with the quality of the silk, forcibly suppressing the original price. If the manufacturers argued, the merchants would completely reject the futures, refusing to accept them. As a result, manufacturers, forced by the circumstances, had to reluctantly accept delivery, knowingly suffering losses.</p>
<h3>Wage Reduction</h3>
<p>Regarding the treatment of female silk factory workers and employees, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a labor-management mediation committee on July 8th to mediate and sign a record. The wages of female workers were restored from 45 cents to 50 cents, weekly bonuses were 20 cents per week, and employees received two workdays' pay per month. Employees also received silkworm moth subsidies of 20 cents per yuan and two workdays' pay per month. After implementation, the cost of the reeled silk increased. Initially, with slightly better silk markets in Europe and America, they could barely maintain operations. Now, with the silk market low, it is difficult to maintain operations. In order to maintain the status quo and avoid bankruptcy, wages for male and female workers should be appropriately reduced.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>The chairman explained in detail the two issues raised by the Zhabei district silk factories and submitted them for discussion. Initially, all silk factories believed that the government should uphold justice regarding the difficulties caused by foreign merchants in futures deliveries and should not arbitrarily find fault or oppress them. Workers' wages should be reduced appropriately and submitted to the government for approval. After the chairman's persuasion, the opinions of the various factories were combined, and the above two remedial measures were merged into one: that is, imitating the original method of the Baotai and other silk factories in the Nanshi district, the workers' wages should be changed to a production-based system, and all factories should implement it uniformly. Female workers will inevitably produce better silk, so foreign merchants will have no excuse to find fault, and workers' wages can be spared from reduction. The matter was then submitted for detailed discussion, and it was not until 8 PM that the principle of changing to a production-based system was passed. As for the detailed measures, they will be discussed at a later meeting after they have been drafted.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers' Association Actively Preparing for National Exhibition</h3>
<p>Since initiating the Shanghai National Products Promotion Exhibition, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association has been actively preparing with the National Products Promotion Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Association. As the original venue was insufficient for office use, the association moved to its new address at 160 Baike Road yesterday and began registration. Office hours are from 8 AM to 6 PM. With the exhibition date approaching, the association yesterday notified all member factories to come to the association for registration immediately. The original letter stated:</p>

<h3>Merchants' National Salvation Association Suggests Setting September 18th as Air Defense Day</h3>
<p>Air Defense Drills to be Held Every Year on This Day</p>
<p>The city's Merchants' National Salvation Association, noting that the Soviet Union and various European and American countries all have air defense day regulations to encourage vigilance, yesterday sent a letter to the Aviation Association, requesting that September 18th be designated as Air Defense Day as a permanent memorial. The letter stated: (Omitted above) Since the invasion began, followed by the Shanghai Incident and the various passes of Xifengkou and Gubeikou, all were attacked in rapid succession. The harm caused by enemy aircraft bombing in the above battles is unbearable to recall. Considering that your association was established with the purpose of promoting aviation, and after ten years of hardship in Wu, we should embrace the ambition of wiping out the shame and seeking revenge. We dare to request that September 18th be designated as Air Defense Day every year, and that air defense drills be held every year on this day to alert the public and as a permanent memorial, also to support the purpose of promoting aviation to save the country. Whether this is appropriate, we respectfully request your association to decide.</p>
<p>Several people are to be appointed to the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee will then hire several experts to form a product evaluation committee. Under the Standing Committee, there will be a General Affairs Section and a Secretariat, which will carry out the association's affairs under the direction of the Standing Committee. The General Affairs Section will have a Finance Division, a Venue Management Division, a Publicity Division, a Solicitation Division, a Discipline Division, a Public Relations Division, a Entertainment Exhibition Division, and a Document Division.

<h3>Record of the Joint Meeting of Fellow Provincial Associations of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Discussing the issue of Yellow River water entering Jiangsu and requesting the cessation of surcharges</p>
<p>The fellow provincial associations of Jiangsu province in Shanghai held a joint meeting at the Yangzhou fellow provincial association in Zhabei at 4 PM yesterday. More than thirty people attended and Song Shixiang was publicly elected chairman. Two proposed issues were discussed: (1) The issue of Yellow River water entering Jiangsu. The association believes that this Yellow River flood is rare in history. Now that the water has flooded into Jiangsu, the people of northern Jiangsu are alarmed every night. If it affects the autumn harvest, the future will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, it was decided in public to hold another joint meeting on a scheduled basis, and to telegraph Commissioner Gao Han of the Supervisory Committee to attend and discuss the Huai River diversion together, in order to actively carry out the work. (2) Requesting the cessation of winter grain surcharges. Winter grain in Jiangsu province is subject to a surcharge of two yuan per stone, which has been levied for several years. The deadline for this session is approaching, and the provincial government's meeting plans to continue collecting it. The association believes that this is contrary to the rural revitalization plan. It was immediately decided to ask Mr. Song to telegraph the provincial government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a cessation in order to maintain the livelihoods of farmers. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter visited Mr. Song's private residence to inquire. According to him, the telegram is being drafted, with the general idea being that the tax burden in Jiangsu province is the heaviest in the country. At a time when rural areas are declining and people's livelihoods are withered, if this extra heavy tax is not stopped, farmers will inevitably go bankrupt and the foundation of the country will be damaged. The telegram will be completed soon and will be sent out soon.</p>
<h3>Colin Smith, Secretary of the US Court for China, Reappointed</h3>

<h3>Petition to Beijing by Workers at the Maigen Road Loading and Unloading Station Ended Without Result</h3>
<p>Central Government Refuses to Revoke Order; Union Cables Workers to Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>All loading and unloading workers at the Maigen Road freight station of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways refused to register with the railway bureau and sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Central Civil Movement Committee. There were no results. The union has cabled them to return to Shanghai first and then handle the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Petition to Beijing</h3>
<p>All the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Road sent representatives Deng Jiahua and 34 others, led by Huang Guoying of the two-railway union, to Beijing on the Jinghu night express on the 16th of this month to petition the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee. On the morning of the 17th, they went to the Central People's Movement Committee, where they were received by Section Chief Xu Wentian. Regarding the workers' demands: (1) Maintain the original organization of the cooperative. The response was that the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways had repeatedly consulted and decided to abolish the contracting system, establish a workers' office, and now the interim rules have been promulgated, so it is inconvenient to revoke the order. (2) Restore the right to elect the four chief foremen. The response was that the right to elect the four chief foremen was abolished because the merchants of the two railways accused the four chief foremen of misconduct, which was found to be true, so the railway bureau was allowed to abolish the right to elect them.</p>
<h3>Workers' Declaration</h3>
<p>Workers at the Maigen Road Station Loading and Unloading, a declaration for the second petition to Beijing to request the protection of the cooperative and the original chief foremen. (Omitted above) Unfortunately, on June 7th of this year, the Maigen Road Loading and Unloading Cooperative was forcibly dissolved and the cooperative was dissolved by the Jinghu Huhangyong Railway Administration, which used force to restore the contracting system, took over the loading and unloading work, and caused major disputes. The matter was accepted by our Central Committee and the Ministry of Railways, and we were waiting quietly for the matter to be dealt with. During this period, the workers only relied on the effective leadership of the four chief foremen of the cooperative, knew only to strictly abide by laws and regulations, and worked hard to serve the road, waiting quietly for the superiors to clearly judge right and wrong, and solve the problem of the workers' livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the railway bureau still has people who are not satisfied with the workers and are doing everything possible to deceive the superiors, confuse the hearing, mess up black and white, and must achieve the reorganization of the cooperative and the cancellation of the four chief foremen before stopping. It is obvious that this kind of intention is to put the workers to death and not stop. Therefore, when the Central Committee and the Ministry of Railways sent people to Shanghai this time, they did everything possible to win them over and were extremely attentive. The most important points in the solution to the dispute were approximately four points: (1) The contractors sent by the railway bureau must be abolished. (2) The old cooperative should be changed to an office. (3) Two new chief foremen should be elected to manage everything in the office. (4) The original four chief foremen should not be re-elected after the reorganization. Alas, this kind of solution is really confusing. The workers' knowledge is really shallow, and they dare not recklessly cite legal principles, but in terms of facts, the so-called abolition of contracting in the first point is that the railway bureau knows that contracting is not allowed by the Central Committee and most of the departments, so it is happy to change its course according to the wind, and happily abolishes it on the surface. The second point, that the cooperative should be changed to an office, is inevitably deliberately mystifying. The cooperative is a group that workers use their collective wisdom and efforts to protect their due legal benefits. When it is changed to an office, everything can be dictatorial, and there is no room for workers to speak. Who will believe that it is not a disguised form of contracting? In the third point, the railway bureau now excuses that the old four chief foremen are not doing their job well, but now it is suddenly changed to two people who can manage everything. Is it not a strange thing? Judging from the railway bureau's intention, removing one chief foreman can reduce one person to be the spokesperson of two people, which is not a great pleasure. The fourth point is probably because the workers are not being fooled, so it is straightforward and happy to deprive the old chief foremen of their right to be elected, and fundamentally eliminate those who work hard to serve the workers, so that the workers lose their leadership and can arbitrarily manipulate and oppress the workers in order to implement their original claims. Considering the above, although the workers are extremely ignorant, they really cannot remain silent and are forced to make a final lament, hoping to invite public appraisal, so that the workers will not be in crisis forever and finally fall. Recalling the Maigen Station Cooperative, although as the railway bureau said, there is a possibility of reorganization, it can only be reorganized in accordance with the old articles of association. The workers dare not but follow the order. If it is changed to an office and new articles of association are made, then the workers' original interests will have been invisibly exploited. The workers cannot accept this change of name. As for the number of chief foremen, it must still maintain the original number in order to preserve the true meaning of cooperation and not make the workers work for one or two people, in the form of slaves, so that they suffer and have nothing to tell. The so-called old four chief foremen have already declared that they are willing to give up their right to be elected. After thinking about it again and again, the workers cannot let it happen naturally and allow others to play with them, give them the crime of manipulating and holding on, and ignore the workers. Moreover, they cannot deprive them of their right to be elected for the sake of the workers' future happiness, causing them to be wary and willing to be content with the status quo. Can they not cry aloud for the future of the workers' movement? Under these circumstances, the workers would rather be shattered like jade than be preserved like tile, and they have to make a second appeal in order to preserve the old cooperative and maintain the right of the old chief foremen to be elected, and must achieve the goal. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Urge Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>All the petitioning worker representatives, because the Central Government's answer was of no result, insisted that they would not return to Shanghai until the purpose of the petition was achieved and would all stay in Beijing. Huang Guoying of the two-railway union immediately telegraphed Shanghai to ask the executive directors of the union for instructions and rushed to Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 18th to report on the progress of the petition. The union presented it for discussion at the board meeting the day before yesterday and telegraphed Beijing that night to urge the worker representatives to return to Shanghai first and wait quietly for the union to handle it according to law. It is said that the worker representatives accepted the union's advice and returned to Shanghai from Beijing last night, and will arrive in Shanghai this morning to report to the union and decide on a plan.</p>

<h3>Part of the Stolen Foreign Money in the 120,000 Giant Robbery Case Discovered</h3>
<p>Li Zhou's Loss of Silver; Zhou Xuechun Flees with Stolen Money</p>
<p>In the Yong'an Street giant robbery case of 127,000 yuan that shocked the time, Li Along (nicknamed Scarface Along), the great thief, his wife Zhou, 21 years old, has been living on the upper floor of the Huaxingchang Ivory Store at No. 58 Fumin Road in the New North Gate. However, because Along does not engage in legitimate business on weekdays, but associates exclusively with bandits, and likes pleasure, and also has a mistress outside, he rarely returns home, so the relationship between the couple is not very harmonious. Zhou Xuechun from Changzhou, 17 years old, his father Zhou Yupei has been running the Zhou Yuanchang redwood shop at No. 48 Lujia Lane near Along's new residence. Because Xuechun does not seek to improve on weekdays, but associates exclusively with the lower class, wanders in an undisciplined manner, and has been repeatedly admonished, but Xuechun eventually ignores it due to his stubborn and evil nature. In November of the previous year, Xuechun was only 15 years old, and he had a taste and was very intimate with Zhou, whom he met. Afterwards, Xuechun would sneak into her house whenever Along went out and have an affair with her, so Along, the great thief who was as fierce as a tiger and wolf, was also kept in the dark. However, this matter was soon heard by Xuechun's family, but there was nothing they could do. However, after the giant robbery case of 127,000 yuan occurred, Along fled to other ports. When he left, he sent 5,000 yuan of stolen foreign money to Zhou to keep, and told her to find her own way. However, Zhou was also afraid of being arrested by the police and hid everywhere all day long. She felt that there was no place to hide this money. After discussing it with Xuechun, she handed the money to Xuechun and took it to his home, and put it in a small leather suitcase and buried it under the floor in the shop. Moreover, in order to temporarily avoid the limelight, she and Xuechun avoided living in Changzhou until the beginning of this month, when they learned that Along had been arrested by the police and sent to court for sentencing and imprisonment, so this case</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo Songbird Competition</h3>
<p>Two Crocodiles Shipped to the Zoo Today for Display</p>
<p>Scaly Armor, Sword Tail, and Piercing Eyes Make Them Terrifying</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Zoo opened on August 1st, the road on Wenmiao Road has been full of traffic and crowded with visitors. Recently, in order to increase the interest of visitors, the zoo is preparing for various animal competitions. The preparations for the competition in recent days and the news that the crocodiles have arrived are as follows:</p>
<h3>Songbird Classification Competition</h3>
<p>In order to promote proper entertainment and increase interest, the zoo is preparing for a songbird classification competition, setting up hibiscus, parrot, white-eye, lark, mynah, and thrush groups, etc., and holding them on a seasonal basis. The first competition has been decided to be the hibiscus group and will be held next month. They are currently seeking participation from those who have hibiscus. The competition rules are being drafted, and will be officially announced after being approved by the Municipal Education Bureau. In addition, regarding practical animals such as horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, and ducks, it is also decided to prepare for competitions or hold exhibitions, so that the varieties and feeding methods can be properly improved during the observation.</p>
<h3>Crocodiles Shipped for Display</h3>
<p>Crocodiles are reptiles that are produced in the tropics, are very large in shape, and sometimes go ashore to eat humans and animals. Those produced in Anhui, Jiangxi, and other places are smaller in shape and docile in nature. The two crocodiles purchased by the zoo this time are produced in Anhui Province. One is about five feet long and the other is about four feet long. With snake heads, turtle feet, scaley armor and sword tails, and piercing eyes, they are very terrifying. They have been shipped to the zoo today</p>
<p>for display and open to visitors.</p>
<h3>Elephant Acquisition in Progress</h3>
<p>The zoo previously ordered an elephant from Calcutta, India. It was transported to Hong Kong, where a contracted animal merchant examined it and discovered a disease in both feet. It was immediately returned to its origin. Another elephant was selected in Siam (Thailand), but the Siamese authorities are currently prohibiting the export of elephants, so it is not easy to transport it out immediately. The contracted animal merchant is currently devising a method, and it may be possible to transport it to Shanghai in a month or two. As for the zoo's expansion plan, it is also currently being planned and prepared. The date of realization should be in the coming spring.</p>
<p>His head was slightly lowered, and the two then boarded a train and returned to Shanghai, lodging in a hotel. He ordered Xuechun to secretly bring the previous stolen money for use. This sum was originally saved by Zhou as a source of livelihood for the future. At that time, Xuechun immediately returned home. At this time, his family had already discovered Zhou's hidden stolen money and were greatly surprised. Yupei scolded his son Xuechun, and then ordered his daughter Aibao, together with Xuechun, to return the money to Zhou. At that time, Zhou suddenly discovered that only 4,350 yuan of the stolen money remained, with 650 yuan missing. Because Xuechun was his lover, he did not delve into it further. Later, due to the high expenses in the hotel, he rented a house at No. 339 Avenue Anaquin in the French Concession. All the stolen money, 4,000 yuan, was still stored in a small leather suitcase, and the remaining 350 yuan was placed outside for the purpose of hiring lawyers for appeals. Unexpectedly, on the 14th of this month, Xuechun had evil intentions and colluded with a man living with Zhou. Taking advantage of Zhou's unpreparedness, they secretly stole the small leather suitcase (containing 4,000 yuan of stolen money) and fled together. Zhou discovered this, and in desperation, searched everywhere, but they were nowhere to be found. However, the day before yesterday, Zhou suddenly heard that Xuechun and others were hiding in a hotel at the North Railway Station, and that his sister Aibao was also there. He immediately rushed there, and after inquiring, he was told that Xuechun and others had boarded a train to avoid going to other places. He believed that his sister Aibao must know Xuechun's whereabouts, so at about 8 p.m., he rushed to Zhou Yuanchang's rosewood shop to negotiate with Aibao, forcing her to reveal Xuechun's whereabouts. However, Aibao and others claimed not to know, which led to a disagreement and a sudden conflict. The police arrived and took Zhou, Aibao, her father Yupei, and her mother Wang into the Second Precinct of the First District. Yesterday morning, during the preliminary trial by Chief Liu Yunfang, Li Zhou stated the whole story and requested a thorough investigation. When questioned, Zhou Aibao confessed that Zhou had given 5,000 yuan of stolen money to her younger brother Xuechun for safekeeping. At that time, Xuechun secretly hid the money under the floor in the shop without telling anyone at home. Later, my father discovered it and beat Xuechun, and then gave the money to Xuechun, ordering him to return it all to Zhou. Afterwards, my brother did not return home, and my father and others were anxiously searching for him without success. Until yesterday, I suddenly heard from someone that Xuechun was at a hotel at the North Station. I immediately rushed to the hotel, but I was too late. The waiter said that Xuechun and others had taken a train to another place. I immediately returned home, so I really do not know about Xuechun's whereabouts and whether he privately stole the stolen money. When questioned, Zhou Yupei and his wife gave the same statement as Aibao. Because this case is extremely important, the police were sent to investigate. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., a document was prepared and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Trade Policy Toward Russia</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has planned to divide into state-run and joint-venture types. It can be selected and implemented after the return of Finance Minister Song to the country, according to Xin Xin News Agency. Since the resumption of trade between China and Russia, Russian goods have been increasingly imported, and their total value has reached ten million yuan. However, Chinese goods exported to Russia have been in a slump. Only tea has been successfully traded, with a total value of only about one million yuan. Other goods are even more scarce. The biggest reason is that Chinese merchants lack organization and adhere to the established practice of free trade, while Russia's commercial policy for imports is completely based on national needs. Goods that are not needed are completely excluded, and only needed goods are allowed into the country, completely controlled by the government. As for exports, the government provides economic backing. Therefore, Chinese merchants engaged in trade with Russia have recently suffered heavy losses, and even their capital has been seized. For several months, China has been in a position of complete failure. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency has learned from industrial circles that the Ministry of Industry once planned to establish a special bureau for trade with Russia. However, the Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, expressed his objection to China's state-run and government-supervised commercial operations when he met with Foreign Minister Luo Wengan and Industry Minister Chen Gongbo in Beijing. His reason was that China adopts a free trade policy towards all countries, so why is it different for Russia? At the same time, he did not express his approval of China organizing a commercial delegation to Russia. Recently, Russia sent a commercial commissioner, Goma, to China to organize a Sino-Russian trade company to handle exports and imports, which shows its intention. It is now known that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the failure of the previous method, has decided to adopt a trial implementation of the previous method for trade with Russia. It is currently actively planning and has made considerable preparations. Once Finance Minister Song Ziwen returns to the country, he can discuss and decide on its implementation, so as to avoid losses to Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3>The Work of the Products Association at the Chicago World's Fair</h3>
<p>Hired Americans to promote the Puppet State. The consulate and association negotiated to stop it.</p>
<h3>Organizing a Propaganda Committee</h3>
<p>The Products Association participating in the Chicago World's Fair learned that the Japanese built a pavilion next to the Japanese pavilion called the South Manchuria Railway Company Exhibition, which promoted the puppet state's government organizations and economic situation. They also hired an American, Curen, to give four lectures a week at the Museum of Science, purely promoting Japan and the puppet state. This was jointly negotiated by the consulate, the Products Association, and the Chinese Association, and has now been canceled. The Products Association specially organized a propaganda committee two weeks ago, electing Representative Zhang Xianglin as the chairman of the committee, Zhang Laodu as the secretary and accountant, and the committee members are Zhang Xianglin, He Fengshan, Tan Zan, Liu Fuzhao, Wang Gongxing, Wu Xiexun, Fang Shenzhang, Li Deming, etc. In addition, the Chinese National Overseas Chinese Association and the Chicago Kuomintang also sent representatives to participate in the meeting. As for the propaganda plan, He Fengshan and Li Deming have been designated to be responsible for it. The propaganda plan includes distributing propaganda materials and giving lectures, with the theme of the New China, and the location is temporarily set in the public exhibition hall of the Chinese Pavilion.</p>
<h3>Refuting the Propaganda of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>The American, Couran, was propagating the puppet state on behalf of the Japanese at the Museum of Science at the Chicago World's Fair. After the Products Association and the consulate jointly negotiated with the Chicago World's Fair authorities, it had been canceled. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, Couran suddenly came to our Chinese Pavilion and requested to talk to Representative Zhang Xianglin. He actually claimed that our side should intercede with the Chicago World's Fair authorities on his behalf to allow him to promote Japan at the fair, without mentioning the puppet state, otherwise he would file a lawsuit and demand compensation for losses, because he makes a living by giving lectures. This time, he suffered great damage to his reputation due to the interference of the Chicago World's Fair, and the reason why the Chicago World's Fair interfered was because of our request, so we must demand compensation from us. Representative Zhang</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Society Requests Prohibition of Live Skinning and Sale of Frogs</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese Animal Protection Society learned that live skinning and sale of frogs are common in small vegetable markets in the city and suburbs of this city. It sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting it to issue a general order to its subordinates to investigate and prohibit such activities. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, according to a letter from the Husheng News Agency, it is stated that catching and eating frogs has long been prohibited. Recently, there have been live skinning and sale of frogs in the city and suburbs, and the vendors are extremely cunning, using bamboo baskets to store frogs, covered with fish to conceal them, and cruel people are accustomed to buying them, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, we specifically request that you forward this to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reiterate the ban, and order your subordinates to strictly prohibit such activities. Accordingly, it is found that frogs protect the five grains and have always been prohibited from being caught and killed. However, some ignorant people are greedy for petty profits and violate the ban to catch and sell them, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, this letter is sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and issue a general order to your subordinates to investigate and prohibit such activities, which is truly a public duty.</p>
<p>replied, "If you can listen to my advice, you should know that the words 'Manchukuo' have no status under American law. Promoting Manchukuo has no legal basis. You should understand this first. If you want to sue, then we will definitely not be afraid." Couran had no words and retreated.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman Committed Suicide in the Dongchang Hotel on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>A Catholic medal was hanging on her chest</p>
<p>Shen Xiaomei, a young woman from Changzhou, 25 years old, came to the Dongchang Hotel at No. 5 Wufeng Lane, junction of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin in the French Concession at 11:30 a.m. on the 19th, carrying a bundle wrapped in a handkerchief, and booked Room 16 upstairs.</p>
<h3>Test Drive Record of Xin Ningshao</h3>
<p>More than 1,500 guests visited. The cabin was renovated and everything was brand new. The Shanghai-Ningbo liner Xin Ningshao of the Ningshao Company was overhauled this year and anti-theft equipment was installed. The passenger cabins of all classes were also improved. Yesterday was the test drive of the renovated ship, and the company invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the ship. There were more than 1,500 guests. The test drive was very satisfactory. The ship sailed out at about 10:00 a.m. and returned to Nanshi at 5:00 p.m. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Cabin Improvement</h3>
<p>The Xin Ningshao is the largest and best ship among the five ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It occupies a unique advantage even during normal operation. In order to satisfy the passengers, the ship was overhauled at the Renrui Rong Shipyard this time. The cabins of the first, second, and third classes and the steerage were all renovated. The space was widened, the air was ventilated, and more attention was paid to cleanliness. As for the special rooms in the grand dining room, new-style beautiful beds and sofas were used, and the bed curtains and door surrounds were all replaced with silk fabrics, so that passengers of all classes would not feel the pain of traveling and sailing. The steerage berth has been completely renovated, and four radios have been added to various places to convey music from various places to arouse passengers' interest. The food for passengers has also been specially hired by the company to cook famous chefs, divided into Chinese and Western meals, which are even more abundant than before. Passengers can also freely add dishes.</p>
<h3>Anti-theft Equipment</h3>
<p>Recently, piracy and looting have occurred frequently. After the Xin Ningshao entered the dock for overhaul on the 23rd of last month, iron fences were added inside the ship to separate the passenger cabins from the bridge. The cost of this project alone has reached 4,000 yuan. From then on, pirates can no longer harbor evil intentions, because even if they mix into the ship, they will not be able to control its crew. Ten iron gates were also distributed in various cabin positions, and armed escort police were stationed at each gate to lock the iron gate. Non-crew members of the ship were not allowed to open them. Therefore, the anti-theft equipment on the Ningbo liner is the first ship with Xin Ningshao, and travelers can be relieved of their worries from then on.</p>
<h3>Hospitality to Guests</h3>
<p>This time, the Xin Ningshao was completely improved, which lasted nearly a month and cost tens of thousands of gold. Yesterday morning, the ship was completed by Yangshupu Ruirong Shipyard. The company notified the shipyard to sail to the outside of Wusongkou for a test drive at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning. The company sent out 1,200 invitations a day in advance, inviting people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the ship. However, because the test drive had to pass through Sanjia Water, the round-trip time was quite long. Sixty tables of Chinese food and 300 Western meals were prepared on the ship to entertain the guests. Company directors Yuan Ludeng, manager Hu Yongqi, and all staff members Chen Renzheng, Bian Yichen, Wang Yunfu, etc., together with the staff of the insurance department, all came to the ship to personally entertain the guests. There were as many as 1,400 or 1,500 guests visiting the ship, and the front of the Ruirong Factory was full of cars and horses.</p>
<h3>Test Drive Situation</h3>
<p>At 10:40 a.m., the Xin Ningshao set sail from the front of the Ruirong Factory, and the shipowner Xin Jixiang, the chief mate Wang Lianbao, and the second mate Jiang Tianlin were responsible for driving the ship to Wusong. After the rain, the new air, the sea breeze hit the face, cool and pleasant, very happy. At 12:02, it arrived at Wusongkou, passed Sanjia Water to the sea surface of foreign masts, and immediately turned the ship back. After traveling about a few miles, it turned the wheel and sailed out again. After three times of turning and sailing, the test drive results were considered very satisfactory. The average speed per hour can be 12 nautical miles. If it is downstream, it can travel 16 nautical miles per hour. At 2:21, it arrived at Xiaota Deng (13 nautical miles from Wusong) and returned to Shanghai. It arrived in Shanghai at 4:40 p.m. and berthed at the Nanshi 16th Pier. During the test drive, the Ruirong Factory also sent two Western technicians, Bavi Hai and Qin Gen, to go with it.</p>
<h3>History of the Ship</h3>
<p>The Xin Ningshao is registered with a tonnage of 2,251 tons and was built by the Ruirong Factory in 1914. It has been 18 years since then. The whole ship has 8 grand dining rooms, 24 official cabins, 64 room cabins, each of which can accommodate three people. The total number of ships has four decks, and even the hanging berths can accommodate 3,000 passengers. The whole ship is constructed of steel plates, with a total of five layers.</p>
<h3>Entertainment to Help</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were special entertainment programs on the ship to help the guests' interest, including harmonica, magic, dancing, music, and the Black Cat Dance Troupe, the Peking Opera of the Shenshang Yage Collection, etc. There were many programs. It was originally planned to perform on the upper deck, but because the meal time was too long, the entertainment time had to be shortened. Yesterday, the guests were mostly from customs declaration, Hakka, shareholders and directors, and banking and insurance industries. There were 144 staff members to entertain, so the guests were very satisfied.</p>
<h3>Resume Class Today</h3>
<p>Xin Ningshao originally ran Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classes. Since the suspension of repairs, the old Ningshao has been dispatched to take over. This time, the whole ship has been renovated and the passenger cabins are like new. Therefore, the company attaches great importance to this. After returning to the 16th Pier in Nanshi yesterday afternoon, it was scheduled to start classes as usual at 5:00 p.m. today, replacing the old Ningshao and running the Yangtze River class.</p>
<p>After lodging and paying the room fee, the waiter brought in tea and lunch. After Xiaomei finished eating, she closed the door and went to bed. I don't know what kind of stimulation she suffered, and she had a short-sighted view. After closing the room door, she took poison and committed suicide. The waiter saw that her room door was tightly closed and there was no sound. Because she was a female guest, he thought she must be taking a nap and it was inconvenient to knock on the door to ask more questions. It was not until 8:15 in the evening that she still did not get up. The waiter Liu and Shang urged her to have dinner and called her but she did not respond. He knocked on the door but there was no sound. He was surprised and pried open the door to check. Xiaomei had already died of breath, and her body was lying stiff on the bed. He immediately reported to the French patrol room and sent a detective to rush there to take the body to the autopsy office of Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall. Because there was no way to find her family, he reported to the Second Special District Court yesterday and asked the Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan to come to the office with a forensic clerk. It was verified that the deceased had died of poisoning before her death, and the body was ordered to be photographed and buried by Tongren Fuyuantang, waiting for the family to claim it. The corpse was of medium height, with short hair, and two gold teeth inlaid in the upper plate of her mouth. She was wearing a short white linen shirt, short white linen shorts, and bare feet with flesh-colored silk stockings. She wore a pointed-toe shoes made of horizontal striped cotton cloth. A Catholic medal was hanging on her neck. There was a short Xiangyun gauze shirt, a short white twill cloth shirt, a pair of ant cloth pants, and a white linen cloth bag in the handkerchief bag. There were no other valuables. It is speculated that the deceased was a family member who must have committed suicide because of a family quarrel, or because she was seduced by her lover and had no face to go home, and committed suicide.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Shanghai General Labor Union Returned to Shanghai to Petition</h3>
<p>The Sanyou Factory case was answered satisfactorily</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Municipal General Labor Union previously submitted petitions from various labor unions regarding the labor dispute case of Sanyou Industrial Company. Although the three-trial judgment had been made and the execution period had expired according to law, the local court delayed it for four months and still refused to execute it. During the sixth enforcement hearing, the presiding judge even changed the arbitration award without authorization, which caused opposition from the labor side and requested to send personnel to Beijing to petition the central government to correct it. After receiving the report, the association immediately designated Zhou Xuexiang and Li Hua, together with the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, to send representatives Gong Yuting and Bao Boyi to Beijing to petition the central government. The petition representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to their discussion, after arriving in Beijing, they first petitioned the Central Party Headquarters, and Secretary-General Ye Chucang received them. After explaining the ins and outs, he promised to handle it immediately. Then they went to the Executive Yuan to petition, and Councilor Chen Xian received them, also promising to forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for correction. The next day, they went to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to petition, and Secretary Feng Youzhen received them, replying that if the case was true, it was indeed illegal. The Ministry would send personnel to Shanghai to investigate. If there was such a change in arbitration, it would be corrected according to law. Finally, they went to the Central People's Movement Committee to petition, and Section Chief Ren Zhongheng of the Workers' Section received them, also promising to provide assistance so that the dispute could be resolved as soon as possible. The petition representatives believed that the result was satisfactory, so they took the overnight express train back to Shanghai the night before.</p>
<h3>Last Research Committee Meeting on the Constitution Draft of the National Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>The National Lawyers Association convened representatives from the five lawyers' associations at the Shanghai Lawyers Association at the junction of Rue Belles and Avenue LaFayette in the French Concession at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (Sunday) for the final research committee meeting on the Constitution Draft. The participating committee members were Liu Lumin and Zhu Qichao from the Jiangning Lawyers Association, Zhang Tao from the Hangzhou Lawyers Association, Wang Weizhen and Shen Junru from the Shanghai Lawyers Association. Tian Heming and Hu Chongji, members of the Shanghai Lawyers Special Research Constitution Committee, were present. Shen Junru was publicly elected as the chairman and Dai Jiguang as the recorder. The meeting was held as usual. The meeting situation is summarized as follows: ㈠ Reporting matters: (A) Chairman Shen reported that the opinions received by the association included the opinions of the Shanghai Lawyers Association on the general provisions, the opinions of the Zhenjiang Lawyers Association on the ethnic provisions, and the opinions of other associations have not yet been received. It is now planned to ask representatives from the Hangzhou County Association to express their opinions. (B) Committee member Zhang Tao, representative of the Hangzhou Lawyers Association, reported that he could not collect the constitution draft of Committee member Zhang Zhiben, so he did not study it. If there is a draft of Zhang for reference, he can study it further and contribute his opinions within a limited time. (C) Committee member Liu Lumin, representative of the Jiangning Lawyers Association, proposed to first report the constitution research opinions of the Shanghai Association. (D) Special Committee member Tian Heming reported on the constitution research opinions of the Shanghai Lawyers Association and stated the process step by step. (E) Special Committee member Hu Chongji reported on the opinions of the Land Chapter of the Livelihood Chapter on the equalization of land rights and outlined the 24 specific articles drafted, expressing the significance as (1) recognizing that people have the private ownership of land, and the state can collect it; (2) before the land is nationalized, the state must also equalize its ownership; (3) in the implementation of the equalization method of farmers owning their land, the state has control over agricultural production, and then separately stated the opinions of each article. (F) Committee member Zhu Qichao, representative of the Jiangning Lawyers Association, reported that the Jiangning Association's opinions on the guarantee of the research constitution draft have now been distributed to various members for research, and the specific research opinions will be submitted in about a week. (G) Committee member Liu Lumin, representative of the Jiangning Lawyers Association, reported that the research draft of the fifth chapter, regarding the guarantee of the constitution, believes that the guarantee of the constitution has two types: active guarantee and passive guarantee. In the current era, China's constitution should adopt an active guarantee, and Wu's Jingxiong constitution draft also adopts an active guarantee, which is very suitable for the era. However, the legislative agencies and their powers that guarantee the constitution are slightly inappropriate and should be revised. (H) Chairman Shen reported that the opinions of the Wuxian Lawyers Association have not yet been received, and the opinions of the Hangzhou Lawyers Association are still to be studied. Is it necessary to convene another meeting? He also said that the association was organized in response to the resolution of the association. Should the opinions submitted by each research association be sent to the association, or should the association collect the research opinions of each association and send them to the association for specific articles? (I) Committee member Wang Weizhen, representative of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, proposed to directly send the research opinions of each association to the association after mutually soliciting opinions for sorting. ㈡ Matters for resolution: (J) The research opinions of each association will be sent directly to the Lawyers Association, and the association will be responsible for sorting them out. (K) Notify each association that has not submitted research opinions to directly send the research constitution draft opinions to the association within three days after receiving the letter, and notify other associations. (L) The task of the association will end today. After the discussion, it was already late at night, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Letter of Appeal for Relief from the Sichuan Compatriots Association</h3>
<p>To Charitable Organizations and Sichuan Compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai:</p>
<p>The Sichuan Association in Shanghai, deeply concerned about the more than two million starving refugees from their homeland, has sent letters to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city, pleading for relief. They have also written to prominent Sichuanese figures in Beijing and Shanghai, requesting them to report the disaster to the central government and seek assistance. Furthermore, they have invited the press and various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city to a meeting. The two letters are recorded as follows: (I) To: National Relief General Association, China International Famine Relief Commission, Xinwei Relief Association, Chinese Red Cross Society, Joint Committee of Charitable Organizations, Various Charitable Institutions, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Shi Liangcai, Mr. Hu Wenhu, Mr. Huang Jinrong, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Yang Zeqing, Mr. Bei Songsheng, Mr. Zhang Yichen, Mr. Hu Fengxiang, Mr. Cheng Zhusun, Mr. Xu Shiying, Mr. Wen Lanting, Mr. Wang Hanzhi, Mr. Wang Yiting, Mr. Wang Yansong, Mr. Wu Tanhao, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Wang Hanliang, Mr. Chu Fucheng, and all great philanthropists: With utmost respect, we inform you that the communist bandits have invaded northern Sichuan, initially occupying only a part of Tongnanba. Subsequently, as the garrison troops were transferred to participate in the Liu-Deng-Bihe battle, Xu (Xiangqian) and Kuang (Jixun) took advantage of the situation to attack and swept through half of northern Sichuan. According to recent telegrams from the Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee and personal accounts from representatives of the Sichuan Northwest Red Disaster Petition Group, Liu Zizhong, He Baoheng, Li Shenpei, and others, it is confirmed that the communist bandits have now occupied most of the ten-odd counties of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Guangyuan, Cangxi, Yi, Chengkou, and Wanyuan in northern Sichuan, creating a devastating "red zone" spanning three thousand miles. Fearing the resurgence of the communist bandits, the people of the north have fled in all directions. The number of refugees gathering in various counties in eastern and western Sichuan has reached over two million. However, due to frequent wars in Sichuan, the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, rendering any charitable aid a mere drop in the bucket. As a result, these victims are deprived of both food and shelter. The cries of parents calling for their children pierce the night sky, and the sight of them suffering from hunger and cold is heart-wrenching. Without timely relief, the elderly and weak will perish in ditches, and the young and strong will be forced to resort to desperate measures. We earnestly hope that your esteemed organization (and respected individuals), known for your benevolent and generous nature, will not hesitate to extend a helping hand to these survivors and remember their plight. Therefore, we dare to send this special letter, earnestly pleading that you embrace your great compassionate spirit and act upon the thought of "treating others' hunger as your own." We beseech you to generously donate and quickly provide relief, like a refreshing rain, to these people who have been suffering from drought for so long. Not only will these two million victims be eternally grateful, but all members of our association will also be deeply indebted. If our request is granted, we suggest that your esteemed organization (or respected individuals) initiate the establishment of a Joint Relief Association for Refugees in the Communist-controlled Areas of Sichuan, and send personnel to Sichuan at any time to personally distribute the aid, or transfer it to our Special Committee for Fundraising and Relief. We leave the decision entirely to your discretion. With sincere appeal, we hope for your kind consideration. (II) To: President Dai Jitao of the Nanjing Academy, Commissioner Shi Qingyang, Chief of Staff Lu Hanqun, Commissioner Xie Wuliang, Chairman Chen Heng, Advisor Sun Yuanliang, Commissioner Xie Huisheng of Shanghai, Commissioner Xiong Jinfan, Commissioner Yang Cangbai, Commissioner Huang Fusheng, Mr. Xia Liangong, Advisor Tan Yigong: With utmost respect, we inform you that our hometown is suffering from misfortune, frequent wars, rural bankruptcy, and perilous conditions. Taking advantage of the situation, the Red Army invaded northern Sichuan, and a small spark has ignited a prairie fire. According to telegrams from Mayor of Chongqing and Chairman of the Relief Committee, Pan Wenhua, and personal accounts from representatives of the Sichuan Northwest Red Disaster Petition Group, Liu Zizhong, and others, we have learned with great sorrow that more than ten counties, including Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Min, Cangxi, and Yi, are either completely occupied by the communist bandits or severely harassed by their guerrillas. The general populace is filled with fear, the elderly and weak perish in ditches, and the young and strong flee in all directions. Those who are unruly and untamed have joined the Red Army and become their accomplices. The once-beautiful Land of Abundance has become a living hell. This is truly a great calamity unseen in Sichuan for centuries since the arrival of Zhang Xianzhong's rebel forces. Currently, the total number of refugees from the red zone who have fled to eastern and western Sichuan exceeds two million. They are starving and their lives are hanging by a thread. To worsen the situation, the communist bandits are using tactics such as promising the return of land and distributing fields to lure the fleeing refugees. These survivors of the disaster are in a state of extreme misery. If they are not provided with prompt relief and resettlement, they will inevitably resort to desperate measures. If the communist bandits are aided by these refugees, the future of Sichuan will be unimaginable, and the overall situation of the country may be in grave danger. Upon learning of this situation, our association immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided on seven measures, which are summarized for your review: (I) Telegram the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Disaster Relief Committee, requesting a large sum of money to provide relief to the refugees from the communist-controlled areas in more than ten counties in northern Sichuan. (II) Send letters to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city, requesting financial assistance.

We would be eternally grateful. In urgent words, we earnestly hope for your reply and extend our respects. Sincerely, Sichuan Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>New Method for Buying Ship Tickets Requires a Guarantor</h3>
<p>The piracy and robbery of ships in this city have become increasingly common. Although people in the shipping industry have repeatedly implemented strict protective measures, such as increasing the number of armed police escorts, installing wireless radios, and searching passengers at the time of departure, these are not fundamental solutions. It is now learned that various shipping companies in this city are implementing a new method of requiring a guarantor to purchase tickets. All passengers traveling on the Nanhua and Beiyang lines, regardless of whether they are in first class, cabin class, or steerage, must provide a guarantee from a reputable business in this city when purchasing their tickets, ensuring their responsibility. This measure was implemented yesterday.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Investigates Disaster Victims in Yingfu</h3>
<p>Disaster Relief Commissioner Set Off Today　　Carrying Medicine to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The Southeast Headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society in Shanghai received a telegram from the Anhui North Office yesterday, reporting that the eastward advance of bandit gangs in Henan Province had caused extreme suffering in Yingfu. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Shanghai Headquarters: According to a telegram from the Zhengyang Branch, bandit gangs in Henan Province have moved eastward, causing disaster in Yingfu. The affected areas include Yongxing, Huiliu, Nanzhao, Yunhe, Miaotai, Wangji, Zhao Ji, Sanliwan, Shibalipu, and various villages and forts. The burning, killing, looting, and pillaging are too horrible to describe. Countless corpses have been washed down the Ying River. We have dispatched personnel to retrieve and bury them. However, the dead are gone, and the living still need to be rescued. At present, refugees are flocking to Zhengyang in an endless stream, estimated to be over 20,000 people, old and young, enduring the extreme suffering of displacement. The bandits are still entrenched, and the refugees cannot return home. Long-term displacement is unbearable. Our society is heartbroken at the sight. We managed to raise a small sum of money and distributed it for emergency relief, but it was a mere drop in the bucket, providing little help. We appeal to you to plead on their behalf and earnestly request the Shanghai Headquarters to show great compassion and provide both medicine and food at the same time, so that thousands can be saved from perishing in ditches. Saving lives and restoring flesh to bones would be like a rebirth. Based on this, our office sent personnel to investigate, and the reported situation was the same. However, due to continuous droughts and poverty in Anhui North, it is difficult to organize emergency relief. We can only rely on the headquarters to have mercy on the disaster victims and find ways to rescue them. We hope that medicine and food will be sent as soon as possible. We are anxiously awaiting in Ying. Respectfully, Anhui North Office. It is reported that after receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Headquarters of the society immediately convened a meeting and appointed Wang Daoyuan as the Disaster Relief Commissioner to go to Zhengyang to investigate the disaster situation. He set off today, carrying various medicines, to provide relief. It is said that after Wang sends a telegram back, funds will be immediately remitted for distribution. It is also reported that the society plans to join forces with various charities to handle this matter together.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Native Wine Merchants Association</h3>
<p>Dispute over New Tax System Mediation Unresolved　　Methods to be Discussed at Next Meeting</p>
<p>The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance recently promulgated a fixed tax on native wine. Because tobacco and wine merchants could not afford it, they repeatedly requested that the order be withdrawn, but it was not approved. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Jiangsu Tobacco and Wine Industry Joint Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors from Nanjing, Shanghai, and various counties in Jiangsu Province yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than 40 representatives from various places attended. Zhang Dalian was elected chairman and reported on the progress. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (I) The case of the new tax system dispute is currently being mediated by Mr. Wu Tingsheng, Chairman of the Cigarette Factory Association. He had a meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but failed to resolve the points requested by the association satisfactorily. Please decide on a resolution (Resolution) Regarding this case, after meeting with Mr. Wu Tingsheng, another meeting of the committee will be convened at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. If it cannot be resolved satisfactorily, countermeasures will be discussed at the next meeting.

<h3>Barbering Industry to Discuss the Gao and Zhu Tragedies Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Barbering Industry Committee for Redressing the Gao and Zhu Tragedies. Because the Gao case has been mediated by Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the French Concession Taxpayers' Association, a resolution has been reached. In the Zhu Rong Tragedy, the American Command replied that it did not recognize that Sitti (transliteration) had committed a crime, and did not recognize any compensation. Although the father of the deceased, Zhu Chunjin, entrusted lawyer Yu Xiufang to proceed according to law, and the father of the deceased petitioned the municipal government to negotiate with the US side, the overall support for the settlement still requires a consistent commitment from the entire industry in order to have a final victory. Therefore, the association decided to convene a full executive committee meeting at 10 am today to discuss how to resolve the Gao and Zhu cases.</p>

<h3>Creditors of Riyue Bank Petition to Expedite the Auction of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate</h3>
<p>Since the founder of Riyue Bank and Dashijie Youlan Department, Huang Chujiu, passed away and went bankrupt, the creditors have successively hired lawyers to sue in the former French Concession. After having paid two installments, the balance has not yet been paid off. Before the holiday, all creditors needed a large amount of money, and entrusted lawyer Yan Luqing to act as their agent to the Second Special District District Court, requesting the expeditious auction of Huang Chujiu's real estate so that creditors could be repaid earlier. It is now stated that the approval must wait for the Wanchun Silver Group mortgage claim to be resolved before the auction. All creditors were particularly委 Yan Lawyer to file another statement to expedite the process. It is said that he petitioned for the rapid auction of Huang Chujiu's real estate matter, and the petitioner had repeatedly petitioned for the auction of Huang Chujiu's inheritance to compensate for the claims. This case has been initiated for two years, and the poor and helpless creditors only recovered 20% from the former French Concession, and since the tribunal took over the case, it has also been two years, and no money has been repaid. In the past, due to the past New Years, the petitioners were in need of a large amount of money, and Huang Chujiu's real estate had not been auctioned for a long time. The ordinary claims of the petitioners could only hope that the auction price would be used to offset the remaining amount after deducting the mortgage money, and the repayment date of the remaining amount depended on the timing of the auction by the court. The petitioners had repeatedly petitioned for the auction, but the tribunal did not actively conduct the auction, and the Autumn Festival was approaching. For the sake of filing another petition, please express compassion for the poverty of the petitioners and grant the auction as soon as possible, so that the deposits can be returned to the record as soon as possible, and I was ordered to open the Huang Chujiu real estate most of the deeds are mortgaged with the Wanchun Silver Group, and the deeds cannot be redeemed until the debt is resolved. If the auction is made, the delivery will be difficult and many disputes will inevitably arise. The said mortgage has been resolved. Now the petitioners have learned that the auction or non-auction of the real estate does not require the Wanchun Silver Group issue to be the premise. The real estate has already undergone an auction procedure in the former French Concession and was not suspended due to the Wanchun Silver Group issue. Since the tribunal also auctioned four of the real estate, and it has never been mentioned that the Wanchun Silver Group issue must be resolved. Now, if the Wanchun Silver Group claim cannot be resolved before it can be auctioned, it is unexpected. Again, if the resolution cannot be resolved within one year, the auction of the real estate will also have to wait for one year. If it is not resolved in ten years, will you wait for ten years? We especially petition the court, please do not make the Wanchun Silver Group issue as a pre-condition, please first designate the auctioneer to actively auction, etc.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Writes to Request Cessation of Work on Caoxi Road Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The construction of a vegetable market on Nanshi Caoxi Road, so that the Jiangyin Street vegetable market can be moved there after its completion, has caused panic among all the merchants on Jiangyin Street. They have repeatedly petitioned the municipal government to withdraw the order, but the municipal government has not yet approved the rejection. Last Tuesday, more than 200 merchants gathered at the charitable organization to question and negotiate. A person in charge of the group, Mr. Ye, was responsible for providing a satisfactory response within one week (that is, until tomorrow). Unexpectedly, the group suddenly started construction last Thursday, with workers digging ponds and driving piles, arranging Sanhe earth pillars. The merchants were even more panicked and sent representatives Yan Hongxiang and Fan Gongliang to the Shangbei Steamer Company to ask Mr. Yu Qiaqing for assistance. Mr. Yu believed that the reasons stated by the representatives were legitimate and there were indeed difficulties, so he represented the merchants in expressing their difficulties and wrote to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, asking him to maintain and withdraw the order. It was handed over to the representatives to present to Mayor Wu in person. Mr. Yu also stated that the vegetable market on Caoxi Road has already started construction, so he sent a special letter to the charitable organization, asking them to inform the engineer to stop construction to reassure people. However, regarding the location of the vegetable market and the renovation of the city house, it is necessary to discuss with Mayor Wu and the charitable organization in person in order to resolve it. However, yesterday happened to be the date of the opening ceremony of the entire Ningbo Yinzhen Charity Road. Mr. Yu had already taken the Sanbei Company Ningxing Wheel to Ningbo the afternoon before yesterday to preside over the ceremony. Therefore, before leaving, he instructed the two representatives, Fan Gongliang and Yan Hongxiang, to go to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu after returning to Shanghai to discuss the renovation of the city house and other solutions. He also first wrote to Director Shen of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, asking him to protect the merchants. The original letter stated, Director Shen, Mr. Yiju, Jian, respectfully, I recently learned from the representatives of the vegetable vendors and merchants in Jiangyin Street, Hunan District, Shanghai, that they have opened shops and set up vegetable stalls on Jiangyin Street with meager capital (omitted). It is an established policy to construct vegetable markets. I would not dare to interfere in it. However, since the vegetable vendors and merchants are all limited by their capital, once they are moved, they must make other plans, which is indeed difficult. Therefore, I am speaking on their behalf to express their difficulties. I earnestly pray that you will listen to the difficulties of the merchants and give them your protection. I will be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Yu Hede, August 19.</p>

<h3>Tax Authority Considers Wine Merchants</h3>
<p>Procedures for Tax Rebates on Domestically Produced Beer</p>
<p>There is no precedent for exempting domestically produced beer from factory tax when it is transported to Shanghai and nearby foreign troops. Local beer merchants have submitted a request to the Tax Affairs Department for exemption. In consideration of the wine merchants, the Tax Affairs Department has decided that foreign troops stationed in Shanghai and nearby areas who purchase domestically produced beer must obtain a certificate from the consul of each country or sign and seal the order form, proving that it is for the use of the army. The factory tax must be paid at the factory according to ordinary beer and affixed with a certificate. After the goods arrive, obtain a formal receipt with the stamp of the army and the signature of its highest officer, together with the consul's certificate or the order form signed and sealed by the consul, and send it to the Tax Affairs Department for verification at the end of the month. After verifying, a tax rebate certificate will be issued, allowing it to be used to offset the tax for the following month. If there is any violation of the above procedures, the tax rebate will not be allowed. The Tax Affairs Department has forwarded the information to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau for information.</p>

<h3>One Woman with Two Lovers Causes Turmoil</h3>
<p>Qian Huisheng from Nanxiang, who is over forty years old, has to sell socks because he is poor. He goes out to sell on the roads day and night for a living. He lives with his wife, Wang, in the front building of 9 Weixiang Lane, Baoshan Road. Although Qian Wang is also over forty years old, she is still very lewd. Because her husband is not often at home, she secretly became acquainted with Shen Debiao, who lives with her. Shen is 23 years old and works as a tea room attendant on the Yifeng Company "Pheasant" ship in Zhejiang. However, Qian Wang is still not satisfied and secretly has an affair with Fan Jiaben, a fifth district police officer who is often on guard at the entrance of the lane. Yesterday afternoon, Fan Jiaben went to Qian Wang's room and saw Shen Debiao in the room, so he made an excuse to leave. At around 9:00 pm, Shen came out of Qian Wang's house. When he was walking through the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, he met Fan Jiaben again. Fan was off duty at this time. When he saw Shen, he became jealous and took out a dagger, stabbing Shen twice. One stab was in the leg and the other was in the chest. The murderer, Fan Jiaben, was arrested on the spot and taken to the headquarters for interrogation. Shen Debiao was sent to Tongren Hospital by the patrol police for treatment.

This was discovered by Chinese detective Liu Zhongcheng, who arrested Wang Chen, along with the child and suspects Zhou Wang and Zhou Yuan, and brought them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao of the Special Court continued the questioning. According to the detective's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, an investigation revealed that the child Chen Genfu lived at 3 Jiudi, West Gate in the Chinese area. His mother, Chen Zhao, reported his disappearance to the local public security bureau. Later, she learned that the child was at the Jiangwan Road Women and Children's Relief Society and went to identify him. However, the society's regulations required court approval. It was also found that Zhou Wang and Zhou Yuan were not involved in the case and should be released. Chen Zhao then filed a case, explaining the situation and requesting the return of her child. The defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Xiao ruled that Wang Chen and Zheng Baoxing would each receive eight months of imprisonment. The child Chen Genfu was returned to his mother. Zhou Wang and Zhou Yuan were released.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I read a news article in your newspaper on the 19th regarding the private sale of gold bars and the kidnapping of people, involving a Ms. Huang Jiang, who runs a restaurant in Japan. She secretly sold gold bars privately, hoping for a large profit, and entrusted Zhao Chunbao to bring seven gold bars worth a large sum to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Zhao embezzled the goods. It is said that Zhao has been arrested and that Mr. Feng, Ms. Ji Li, and her husband are also involved. I have always been law-abiding and have a legitimate business. I would never dare to engage in any illegal activities or have any improper thoughts. Unexpectedly, Zhao, out of resentment for failing to obtain a loan, falsely accused others of embezzling and selling the stolen goods. Ms. Ji Li was falsely accused and arrested. The police took her to the First Special District Court for questioning. The hearing was postponed for a week for further investigation by the police. This matter is completely unfounded and is a false accusation. The truth will inevitably come to light in the future. Fearing that the outside world may misunderstand the truth, I request that you publish this letter in the letter to the editor section to clarify the situation. I would be grateful.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>War and Peace</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>Darwin's theory of evolution only states that the world's organisms evolved from lower forms. Modern archaeologists, at most, only go to Mongolia, Egypt, and Asia Minor to dig up a few skeletons and announce that the brains of ancient humans were several times larger than those of modern people. These self-important great scientists are truly "seeing the tip of an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood." They can't even say that "humanity in 1933 is the most intelligent."</p>
<p>In ancient times, everyone cursed war, saying, "War is dangerous and fraught with peril." President Wilson was considered exceptionally intelligent, inventing the slogan "fighting for justice," which somewhat covered up the "evils of war." But after the end of the war, everyone touched their scars and sighed, with no place to express their suffering. The popular novel "All Quiet on the Western Front" fully expressed "war is dangerous and fraught with peril." So, the League of Nations was organized, loudly touting "maintaining world peace."</p>
<p>But by 1933, human intelligence had greatly advanced. What use is a paper tiger like the League of Nations? It was kicked aside, just like that. But "war is dangerous and fraught with peril," and the world needs "peace." So, everyone closed their doors and worked on peace. Japan, in order to ensure "East Asian peace," had to invade the four eastern provinces of China and organize a puppet state. The United States, in order to ensure "Pacific peace," had to build thirty-two warships to maintain the 5:5:3 ratio. Germany, in order to ensure "European peace," had to provoke Hungary, Austria, France, and Poland. Russia, in order to maintain "world peace," could not but strive to expand the strength of the Red Army.</p>
<p>All of these things, who isn't preparing for a second world war? But who isn't raising the big banner of "peace"? Preparing for war for the sake of peace is called "armed peace," how wonderful. Advancing from "armed peace" to no peace, then even if one has become a "war leader," one can still shout "fighting for peace" at the top of one's lungs. It is clearly "war is dangerous and fraught with peril," but with a few "peace smoke bombs"</p>
<p>thrown, everything is perfectly justified. So, I say, "humanity in 1933 is the most intelligent."</p>
<h3>Early Autumn</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, I felt a bit cold wearing just a shirt, so I took a wool sweater from the closet and put it on. It wasn't too hot.</p>
<p>Last night, the crickets were chirping loudly outside the window. Their sound was like that of a triumphant person singing loudly. Because I was so engrossed in listening to the chirping of the insects, I didn't fall asleep until the moonlight had left my little room!</p>
<p>As usual, I drew a tub of cold water for a bath, but as soon as I stepped in, I felt a shiver all over my body. I barely finished washing, and my skin felt a little uncomfortable. I thought to myself, I won't be going swimming with my friends the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>The electric fan lay lonely in the corner of the room. Its blades were still and motionless. Although it had once had a good impression of people, now it had become an outdated object! It would soon be abandoned.</p>
<p>A year passes quickly: a lively and beautiful spring has passed, and a fiery summer has passed. Now, the bleak autumn has arrived, and soon we will have to endure a cold winter. In this way, people can't help but feel sad. But the truth tells us that the seasons are constantly moving forward. After this autumn and winter, won't spring be with us again? We hope for the arrival of spring, and in this bleak season, we must strive to live on!</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun, Text, Dong Liang, Illustration</p>
<p>Family education like this! A certain Mrs. praises her son, saying:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, my luck wasn't good, four rounds and one set, but who knew that he would come up with a four-fold, one 10,000 and one 90,000, 36, 72, 144, 200:::. The child was even happier because of this. It is said that mom later gave him ten copper coins.</p>
<p>After dinner, nothing to do, "nothing to do" seems to be the daily routine. So the three good friends, the sister-in-law in the cubicle, the grandma next door, Mr. Zhang, gathered around the table, still eight rounds, if it was early, another four rounds. Anyway, in this sweltering weather, what's the point of going out! The child was equally bored, grabbing the corner of the table, seeing if there was a "stroke," becoming rich, making a pair. Saying this is the education of adults, is like saying that mom and dad are destroying the sacred heart of children!</p>
<p>Family education has reached this point, it is truly heartbreaking. It is simply speechless!</p>
<h3>A Record of Bumping Into Walls While Seeking Employment</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>This young man held his high school diploma, which he had dreamed of day and night for six years, in both hands, filled with joy and high spirits, and strode into the circle of society to seek employment and find a livelihood.</p>
<p>Stepping into the XX Bureau, he visited the director, presented his diploma, and explained his purpose; he held his breath and waited, respectfully listening for good news.</p>
<p>The director with the mustache shook his head and said: "The situation is unstable, and funds are tight. The bureau has limited positions and it is difficult to place you. Please find other good plans!"</p>
<p>This road is blocked, turn around, go!</p>
<p>Entering the XX Company, he requested to see the manager, presented his diploma, explained his purpose, and listened attentively, his heart pounding. The manager with the high belly frowned and said: "The market is sluggish, business is slow, and the company has been losing money for years. It is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. We will hire you later, sir, when you have great talent!"</p>
<p>This road is also blocked, turn around again, go!</p>
<p>Walking into the XX School, he met with the principal, presented his diploma, explained his purpose, and begged with stuttering speech, his face red. The principal said with a long face: "Not to hide it from you, brother, in this year, there are more people sitting on the bench than flies in summer. Our school is already full, please take another road, brother! Although I feel bad, there is really no way." Bumping into walls everywhere, burnt and exhausted, full of hot hope, ice-cold gas coming out. The school gates are wide open, but those with ambition and no money should not enter. Of course, I can't go to university. The economy is collapsing, a bumper harvest is a disaster, and the countryside is even more impossible to return to. I don't have the strength to pull a rickshaw, and my face is not thick enough to sue. So, the young man had to crumple up a piece of waste paper! The diploma, defeated, returned to the room, prepared his stomach to eat old rice from his hometown, and studied for a degree from a family university.</p>
<p>Graduation is mentioned in the same breath as death, and graduation and unemployment are discussed together. Alas, long live graduation!</p>
<h3>The Newest Fashionable Things</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In the summer of this year, many of the most popular and fashionable things have been discovered in this world, and they have now spread to the whole world.</p>
<p>The newest style of travel clock looks like a fan and is automatic. There is also a flat panel that can be placed on top of the clock for use as a clock stand.</p>
<p>A round moon-shaped stone, connected together with rectangular crystal links, is the most fashionable kind of bracelet.</p>
<p>Clear, striped, or plaid sleeves added to black outerwear are the most popular new outfits. Most likely, they were cut off and then sewn together, matching the size of the cuffs. Some are draped over the shoulders, almost reaching above the shoulders, worn very tightly.</p>
<p>Park benches with color-painted iron poles and rope-woven or grass-woven seats are the most fashionable things in parks.</p>
<p>In the reception room, the most fashionable decoration on all the white walls is two chestnut-colored trees, with white powder used to depict everything from the trunks to the tops of the trees.</p>
<p>Waxed aprons with a wide circumference of fifteen to twenty yards are worn by women at park gatherings or evening parties.</p>
<p>A mirror with a shatterproof glass surface and a mirror-made circle inside, with a bunch of flowers inserted, is a new kind of decoration for the dressing table.</p>
<p>Women's Paradise</p>
<h3>Simple Beauty Tips</h3>
<p>— Bōguāng</p>
<p>A woman's face is what she cherishes the most. She looks in the mirror many times every day and always applies powder. The facial powder on the market today contains a small amount of lead, and everyone knows that lead is harmful to the skin. But the best quality scented powder, made of calcium carbonate and perfume, is specially priced very high to indicate that it is high-quality powder. This kind of powder is only liked by bourgeois women.</p>
<p>Today, I will write down some plebeian beauty methods and contribute them to women who cherish their faces. Every night before going to bed, if you rub some egg white on your cheeks overnight, and wash it off the next morning, after a month, the skin on your face will be smooth and delicate. Another method: Every morning before washing your face, you can use human milk to apply to your face, and wash it off after it dries! Or you can use soy milk instead. These three methods have been tried by many women for a month in a row, and they have all been effective. Oiliness, dullness, and freckles can gradually be reduced, as long as you have perseverance and do not stop halfway.</p>
<p>In our place, there are many Wenzhou women who like to use yams, that is, sweet potatoes, and cut a thin slice every day to rub gently on their faces. After the milky white juice seeping out of the yam has been completely rubbed in, they wash their faces with water. They use it this way every day, without applying powder, and their faces are very good and smooth. It is said that yams have the effect of whitening the skin.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Resigning from His Post to See His Soulmate, the Beauty Silently Approves; Inheriting the Family Property, the Young Man Rejoices Wildly. Zhao Weng waved his hand and said, "I haven't finished what I wanted to say yet! My child hasn't said a word of disagreement with me. But lately, he often says how bitter it is in the army, and how difficult it is to get ahead. Then, when that soldier who was sick last time came and told of his suffering, I was half-hearted. Let's be frank, old lady, you love your daughter, and I love my son, who wouldn't want their children to be together, always in front of their eyes? I'm very happy to discuss this with you. If you feel that the child doesn't need to do this job, I'm thinking of going to the old boss myself, and I can always find him a job. Although he'll earn less money, it'll be a long-term thing." Ms. Jiang said, "This shows that the old gentleman thinks highly of us. Fortunately, there are many days ahead, and we'll slowly talk about it in the future." Zhao Weng pushed his wine glass away, suddenly stood up, and said, "Old lady, don't be busy, I'll find something for you to look at." Saying that, he turned and walked away. Ms. Jiang looked at his behavior and was a little confused. What does he have to show me? Zhao Weng went into the house, and after about ten minutes, he came out holding a large roll of paper, put it on the corner of the table, and pressed it lightly with his hand, and said with a smile, "Old lady, look, this is what our ancestors left for the child." Saying that, he opened the package of paper, which contained a package of land deeds. He gently patted it a few times and said, "These are all land deeds from our old home in Baoding. There are about twenty or thirty acres. Because I'm old and weak, I can't farm the land myself, so I have to rent it out to others. If my child doesn't do this job, he can go home and farm the land, and he can always get by on porridge. I just want a good daughter-in-law, and with my age, what kind of family do I need to run? I'll ask your daughter to take over. Old lady, it's not that I want to climb this relationship, but today I'll just use these nice words to deceive you. For a family, as long as the family is harmonious, even if they eat two meals of millet porridge every day, it's comfortable." (164)</p>

<h3>Milk and Infants</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Suzhen (華文英)</p>
<p>Regarding the appropriate time for breastfeeding, the common habit is to breastfeed without a fixed schedule, sometimes overfeeding to the point of fullness, and sometimes underfeeding to the point of hunger. This causes the digestive system to lose its regulation, leading to weakness and sleeplessness in infants. Therefore, whether breastfeeding with human milk or formula, it is advisable to have a fixed schedule. In the first day or two after childbirth, milk is scarce, and the infant should suckle four or five times a day. After three days, when the milk flow increases, a fixed schedule should be established. Typically, for the first six weeks after childbirth, breastfeeding every two hours is most appropriate, starting from 6:00 AM until 10:00 PM, totaling eight times a day. Breastfeeding is not advisable between 10:00 PM and 5:00 AM the next morning. After this regulated training, the infant will naturally wake up for feedings and sleep at night, allowing the brain, nerves, digestive system, and respiratory system to receive adequate rest.</p>
<p>The use of formula: There are many reasons why cow's milk is unsuitable as a formula. Its taste is too bland, and its consistency is too thick, which does not suit the infant's taste. Moreover, during the hot summer months, bacteria easily proliferate, making it quite dangerous. Therefore, in infant rearing experiments, artificial formulas have emerged. Recently, L.O.V.E. brand milk powder, which is popular on the market, still has milk as its main ingredient, but once formulated, it becomes an excellent nutritious product, although it is still slightly inferior to human milk. Generally, it is best to wait until the infant is four or five months old, when their stomach is slightly stronger, before feeding them formula. When preparing formula, the following items should be placed together: a small lead pot, a glass cup, a small spoon, a small kerosene stove, milk bottles, nipples, a bottle brush, soda water, and a boric acid solution. Cover the items with white cloth or gauze. Then, follow the instructions on the formula label, mix with an appropriate amount of water, and heat to a certain temperature. If the infant is sick, add more water, as long as it does not hinder digestion. Also, if formula is prepared once and there is leftover, do not reheat it for the second feeding. It is best to use feeding bottles with graduated markings. Wash the bottle immediately after use. The cleanliness of the nipples should not be neglected. Every morning, boil the nipples in boric acid solution for a few minutes. After each use, they must be wiped dry. Another point to pay attention to is to check the nipples regularly for any debris inside. If there is any residue, remove it with a bottle brush to prevent mouth pain and loose stools in the infant.</p>
<p>Steps for weaning: Typically, weaning can be completed completely after one year and five or six months. The best way to manage weaning can be divided into two stages: the first stage is weaning from human milk, and the second stage is weaning from formula. Generally, when the mother feels that the milk supply is gradually decreasing, formula can be used to regulate it. On the one hand, the amount of human milk decreases, and on the other hand, the amount of formula increases. This is the best weaning step. It is often seen that once a wet nurse is dismissed or leaves, the milk source is cut off, and the infant, not liking formula, cries and refuses to eat, leading to illness. Therefore, it is best to feed infants formula daily between four and five months after birth so that they can suck on milk bottles and get used to formula as preparation for weaning. Also, weaning should not be done in the summer, and infants should not be weaned when they are unwell. (End)</p>

<h3>Opinions of the Ministry of Education Supervisors on Inspecting Education in Henan Province (2) B. School Education Aspect</h3>
<p>(1) Generally, the classes in schools are well-organized, and the number of students is quite sufficient. Based on educational efficiency, there is little waste. (2) The school buildings and scientific equipment in general schools are mostly simple and crude and should be improved as soon as possible to meet the needs. (3) Secondary schools often lack places for students to study independently and practice. They should plan to increase them. Those who study independently in the dormitories should be strictly inspected and supervised to avoid laziness. (4) Primary and secondary schools, especially general primary schools, often have cumbersome administrative organizations that emphasize form over substance. They should be streamlined and centralized immediately to maximize efficiency. If necessary, the responsibilities of each department should only be listed in the organizational system table. There is no need to set up sections, which leads to many positions and few people, becoming a laughing stock. (5) The forms and booklets used in primary and secondary schools should be appropriate for actual needs, prepared and printed separately, and should also conform to the principle of economy. The preparation of statistical charts should also be limited to those with educational value to avoid wasting time and energy. (6) The curriculum of normal schools and vocational schools is too fragmented. It should be revised in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, concentrating on the main subjects and increasing the amount to meet the actual needs of society. (7) The number of practice hours for normal school students should be increased. In addition to the affiliated primary schools of the practice teaching schools, there should be composite, single-grade, and two-part systems in the future to facilitate normal school students to practice teaching and provide general primary schools with reference and imitation. (9) Because it is not easy to purchase organs in rural primary schools and urban primary schools with financial difficulties, the music subject is often abandoned. In the future, the music curriculum of normal schools should pay attention to the appropriate practice of Chinese instruments such as Sheng (笙) and Dizi (笛) to meet the needs and popularize music education in general primary schools. (10) Many primary schools have established both school mottoes and class mottoes, and the two lack continuity and mutual relationship. It is redundant. The class mottoes should be abolished immediately. (11) Many primary schools arbitrarily select special names for classes, or use characters with the wood radical, or characters with the water radical, or characters with the grass radical, but still change them every year according to the grade level, which is unclear about the original grade level and self-imposed restrictions, which is meaningless. In the future, unless there are more classes, or ability-based group teaching, or other needs with educational significance, one of the civic training standard moral items can be used as its class name. The special name should be cancelled immediately, and the grade level should still be used as the name. (12) Some principals of primary and secondary schools still hold positions outside the school, which hinders the progress of school affairs. It should be strictly restricted. (13) Many primary and secondary school teachers teach purely by injection and lecture, and silently stick to the textbook, reading it one by one, and failing to use it well. Various teaching research associations should be organized to study and improve it in a practical way to promote progress. (14) The employment of primary and secondary school teachers should be based on talent as the standard. The allocation of teaching subjects and positions should be based on academic ability. It should not be perfunctory to reduce educational efficiency. (15) Primary and secondary school textbooks are mostly purchased at will, which is not the case. The examination version of the Ministry should be adopted uniformly to meet the curriculum standards and avoid errors and dangers.</p>
<h3>C. Social Education Aspect</h3>
<p>(1) Social education institutions have been established in the provincial capital and counties. The number is quite considerable. However, except for a few, the results are not very good. (2) Social education funds have been fixedly distributed by the province and counties, but the percentage is still not in line with the standards set by the Ministry and should be increased. (3) The social education work in each county should first engage in the elimination of illiteracy. Organize a literacy movement committee in accordance with the literacy movement publicity plan outline promulgated by the Ministry and strive to publicize it. Popularize public schools in urban and rural areas so that those who have lost their studies will have the opportunity to study. (4) The undertakings run by the public education halls in each county are mostly focused on the superficial publicity. It is not very related to the general public and should be thoroughly improved. The number of departments should not be too many and can be reduced or merged. (5) All books, magazines, and newspapers in the library and public education hall of each county should be purchased as much as possible for the general public to read. Publicize and guide them in many ways in order to attract the public. It is best to set up a mobile library to expand circulation. (6) The provincial sports field is large in scale, and the construction equipment is still considerable. The county sports fields in the counties have not been established universally. The area and equipment of the established ones are mostly narrow and simple. They should be improved. (7) Henan is the oldest province in terms of culture. There are many scenic spots, historical sites and all kinds of literature and antiques. However, the maintenance and preservation are mostly not in place, resulting in damage, theft, private excavation and other situations. The provincial and county literature committees should make proper plans and make practical improvements. (8) The achievements of the Kaifeng Museum, the Anyang Antiquities Preservation Committee, and the Luoyang Heluo Library have been considerable. However, except for the museum, they lack organization and research. For the sake of promoting culture, special attention should be paid to progress. (9) If the school site is used for ancestral temples, the historical sites related to culture should be properly preserved, and no arbitrary destruction or damage should be allowed. (10) The price of stone rubbing and imitation publications is too high, which hinders the promotion of culture and should be improved. (11) Those engaged in social education should set standards and train them strictly to cultivate them. (End)</p>
<p>(16) Primary and secondary school library books are mostly literary. Various science books should be purchased separately to promote practical studies and adapt to students' personalities. (17) We should learn from and imitate the education of other provinces to make progress. However, we should pick up the essence and should not take the dross. In imitation, we should also consider the actual situation and create. (18) Most of the graduates from full-time normal schools with better grades are unwilling to serve as primary school teachers and try to obtain positions as teachers and staff in county-run private secondary schools, or change to the military or political circles, which reduces the excellent members of primary school teachers and is a great loss to education. We must find ways to remedy it. (19) Vocational schools have been established recently to promote production education. However, the employment of students after graduation should be properly planned so as to be different from general education. (20) The handicraft works of various schools in Kaifeng (Girls' Normal School, Six Primary Schools, etc.) are mostly children's toys and daily necessities. They use local ordinary materials or use waste materials. The cost is minimal, but they are strong, applicable, and ingenious. They are very commendable. If they can jointly establish a factory, widely manufacture and sell them, it will be enough to resist the imported goods that are generally needed. (21) Most of the teachers and staff in general primary and secondary schools have educational literacy and are enthusiastic about their work. However, there are quite a few who are decadent and addicted. In the future, they should be strictly refined and strive to improve. (22) The training of students at all levels of schools is quite strict, and the academic style is rectified, which is commendable. (23) The training week system should be held according to the needs of actual life, and it is not necessary to set it once a week, which leads to formalism and loses its original purpose. (24) The sanitary facilities of general schools are not perfect, and there are many bathrooms and washrooms that are lacking. Those with bathrooms are required to take a bath once or twice a week, which is too little in summer. (25) The clothing of general male and female students is mostly simple. However, boys like to keep their fingernails long, and girls like to scatter their long hair. They should be persuaded to improve. (26) On Saturday afternoons in primary and secondary schools, there are still many no classes scheduled, or only one class is scheduled, or only extracurricular activities are scheduled. Invisibly, half a day is added to the holidays, which is not in line with the regulations of the Ministry and should be improved immediately. (27) The preparatory achievements exhibition, sports meeting, and various competitions should not be suspended arbitrarily, which hinders the progress of the formal curriculum. (28) There are many old and damaged desks and chairs. They should be repaired. For the new ones, the structure, format, and various distances should be carefully studied to be beautiful and applicable. (29) The area of the blackboard is too small to meet the application, or the whole piece is too high and cannot be used at the top. The methods of hanging and painting are often not suitable. (30) The area of the sports field is generally spacious, but the ground is not leveled, and the number of sports equipment is small. It should be improved to focus on physical education. (End)</p>

<h3>Zhang Xinfu and Guo Lianfeng of the All-China Games Organizing Committee Hosted News Media in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on the preparation situation and hope to assist in publicity</p>
<p>Zhang Xinfu, the director-general of the Second National Games, and Guo Lianfeng, the director of the propaganda group, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted the local news media at the Xin Xin Restaurant. More than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. First, the chairman Zhang Xinfu reported, generally saying that he and Director Guo were sent here to report on the preparation situation. I am very honored to have you all here. The preparation for this National Games has been basically completed. Please ask Director Guo to report the details. I deeply feel that promoting sports must be universal. This association must work hard, and we also need the assistance of advanced members of the news media to publicize it widely. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will give it practical cooperation. Then, Director Guo reported on the achievements of the Ministry of Education in promoting national sports in the past year and the preparation for the All-China Games, and asked the audience to contribute their opinions to correct the shortcomings. Later, Jiang Xiangqing of the Current Affairs News expressed his opinion, asking the General Assembly to pay attention to the final decision of the referee of the chief referee, and hoping to take sports as sports, without participating in the meaning of politics. The chairman replied and accepted. At about 2:00 PM, the guests and hosts dispersed happily. The report of Director Guo is described as follows:</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Promotes Physical Education Achievements</h3>
<p>Director Guo reported that the meaning of inviting you all here today has already been announced by the chairman. I would like to report to you the Ministry of Education's active promotion of physical education in recent years. China has long been known as the "sick man of East Asia." The people are physically weak and mentally dull, and the high mortality rate makes one deeply feel pessimistic about the future. Therefore, we believe that the path to revitalizing the nation should start with promoting physical education. This year, education specialists sent by the Ministry of Education to various European countries to conduct educational research reported on the new trend in European and American education in recent years: the popularization and universalization of physical education. Germany, in particular, after the war, people throughout the country took it upon themselves to revive the nation and emphasized national physical education. Other countries such as France, the United States, and Italy are also making frantic efforts to promote sports. In view of this, the Ministry of Education held a physical education conference last August to formulate concrete implementation plans for national physical education. According to reports from the Ministry of Education's supervisors over the past year, the public in various provinces have shown a strong interest in sports. In schools, students' physical education performance has made considerable progress. Public sports fields, which were desolate in the past, have also become overcrowded. This progress is very gratifying to us. The Ministry of Education's promotion of physical education is divided into five stages: (1) the establishment of physical education administrative organizations, such as the Ministry of Education and local sports committees. This is the driving force behind the promotion. Recently, nearly twenty provinces and cities have established such organizations. (2) The cultivation of local cadre talents. The Ministry of Education has created a summer physical education refresher course, in which a total of 317 current physical education teachers were sent from various provinces and cities for six weeks of training. They will graduate on the 16th of this month and return to their respective regions, where they can take on the important responsibility of promoting physical education by the central government. (3) The mission of sports meets is to promote the technical progress of athletes, examine the achievements of various regions, and encourage people's interest in physical education, cultivate the virtues of favoring sports and promoting noble entertainment. The national sports implementation plan stipulates that the National Games will be held in various provinces and cities every two years in rotation to promote the improvement of sports facilities in various regions. As for participating in the World Games, our country was represented by Mr. Shen Siliang at the 10th World Games held in Los Angeles last year. Countries around the world hope that we can send more athletes to participate in the first World Games to be held in Berlin in 1935. Of course, we cannot abandon ourselves. (4) Research on physical education techniques. First, establish specialized physical education schools and physical education research institutes. Second, examine and organize China's inherent excellent physical education methods to make them conform to scientific principles. For example, Mr. Chu Minyi's invention of Taijiquan, and the recent improvements of national martial arts by various parties. (5) Physical education assessment. The Ministry of Education is actively carrying out the above four steps, and will conduct performance evaluations in accordance with the national physical education implementation plan after a considerable period of time. This is the key point of the Ministry of Education's promotion of physical education.</p>
<h3>Detailed Preparations</h3>
<p>The general situation of the preparations for this National Games has been reported in various newspapers. What can be reported to you now are the following points: (1) Funding issues. The Preparatory Committee originally planned a budget of more than 130,000 yuan, which was subsequently reduced by the Ministry of Education to 93,120 yuan. For such a large-scale National Games, this meager 90,000 yuan is really limited. Moreover, the central sports field is far outside the city. Even in terms of transportation, and the food and accommodation for referees and staff, the cost is already considerable. In addition, it is difficult to get water near the Mausoleum, and various special facilities are also costly. The renovation and decoration of the venue also require a large amount of money. The Central Political Conference reduced the budget to 50,000 yuan, which is far from enough. Recently, the committee has approved the work plans and detailed budgets of various groups and competition committees, in preparation for submitting them to the Central Political Conference for review. (2) Reception issues. A. Set up inquiry and registration offices. B. The committee will send personnel to Xiaguan to welcome and see off referees and athletes. C. Preferential treatment for transportation for attendees has been negotiated with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways. All staff and referees coming to Beijing to participate in the National Games will be completely free of charge, and athletes will pay a quarter of the ticket price. D. Entrust the China Travel Service to handle travel procedures for referees and athletes. E. Establish a temporary bank at the venue to facilitate referees and athletes to deposit, withdraw, and remit money, and deposit important items. F. Referee accommodation: It has been agreed to borrow a part of the school building of the Veterans' School. Athletes will be accommodated in the dormitories specially built under the stands of the track and field stadium. This dormitory can accommodate more than 2,600 athletes. G. Catering for referees and staff has been contracted out to merchants. As for athletes' meals, according to the established practice of previous games, the competent authorities of each unit will provide funds, and the organizing committee will find suitable restaurants to provide meals. The committee has contacted the Nanjing Restaurant Industry Association to contract out the catering, and they must provide Sichuan, Cantonese, and Jiangsu dishes, priced at five, four, and three corners, for the athletes to choose from. H. For the rest time every night, in order to provide reasonable entertainment for all members, concerts, plays, and film festivals will be held. The recruitment group has contacted various places in Beijing and Shanghai to arrange this. I. There are many famous scenic spots in the capital. The committee is responsible for guiding the participants to visit them. J. Temporary stores provide convenient food and other items for the audience. K. In order to encourage audiences from Shanghai and other places to visit the games, the committee plans to contact the Ministry of Railways and Transportation to provide convenience. (3) Security and hygiene issues. A. Security is the responsibility of Director Ma of the Mausoleum Security Office, and a large number of police officers and military police will be transferred to assist. B. The Food and Water and food are inspected and disinfected by specialists sent by the Department of Health to ensure the hygiene of participants and audiences. C. Examine the physique and health of athletes to prevent unexpected dangers. D. Implement various epidemic prevention measures. E. Set up treatment and ambulance teams to serve at the venue, and designate the Central Hospital as a contracted hospital to benefit participants and audiences. F. Proper facilities are also in place for the sanitation of the venue and its surrounding areas. (4) Traffic issues. A. In addition to the referees and athletes being welcomed and sent off by the committee, the committee also plans to provide special convenience for the audience and is in contact with various parties. B. The venue has a temporary telephone bureau, a temporary telegraph bureau, and a temporary post office. C. Ordinary vehicles are subject to corresponding regulations by the committee, designating routes and parking lots to avoid confusion. (5) Venue and competition issues. A. The central sports field has not been used for a long time, and the venue and swimming pool have been damaged. Repair plans have been carefully designed and are now under construction, with the aim of being completed before mid-September. B. Various competition rules have been printed and will be sent out this week for application in various places. C. The committee believes that there have been too many prizes at previous games, and athletes receive many prizes each time they win, which undermines the meaning of amateur sports. Therefore, it is stipulated that each winner is only allowed to receive one prize, which makes the prize more valuable. Therefore, we have decided not to solicit prizes from various places, and will make our own additions in addition to using the existing ones. D. The list of referees has been roughly drafted and will be submitted to the meeting for discussion soon and invited by letter. E. In the near future, it is planned to convene a meeting of the competition committee to solve various competition issues and decide that the various groups of the competition committee will start working around the 20th.</p>
<h3>Promotion and Publicity Still Rely on You</h3>
<p>Finally, he reported on the preparations for publicity matters, saying that the duties of this group are stipulated in the charter as "handling news advertisements, disclosing the news of the conference, and sports results, compiling conference special issues, managing the conference's broadcasting, photography, film activities, and other domestic and foreign publicity matters." Therefore, the work of this group is divided into four major parts. First, the art section has been approved by the Art Department of the Central Propaganda Department to assist. (A) Photography has been agreed with Wang Kai Photo Studio, which will be responsible for the photography of the venue, but must comply with the following conditions: (1) No preferential conditions shall be agreed with any newspaper, and all shall be treated equally. (2) Personnel must be sent to photograph each event, and must be guided by this group and the competition committee. (3) This committee will provide a darkroom, and photos must be developed and distributed to various newspapers within 30 minutes after taking the photos. (4) Make and send landscape films of the venue and the capital to facilitate publicity. (5) All negatives must be submitted to this committee for numbering and filing. (B) Filming: It was originally planned to contact Lianhua and Mingxing Tianyi, but only Lianhua has been contacted so far. Mingxing has no results because the person in charge is not here. It will probably be contracted by Lianhua alone. The plan is as follows: (1) Photographers must be sent to film all seven events of the conference every day. (2) About 10,000 feet of film will be made. (3) Before the meeting, films of the sports field construction and famous scenic spots in the capital will be made for theaters to show. (4) The films taken will be produced by the company itself in a film studio built near the sports field, and will be ready for screening on the same evening. (C) The news and report section has been approved by the News Department of the Central Propaganda Committee to assist in handling. The main points of the plan are reported as follows: (1) All newspapers and news agencies that wish to send reporters to the venue to collect news must submit the list of reporters to this group for registration from September 1st to 30th so that badges can be issued. (2) Each newspaper or news agency is limited to one person per event. In addition to providing a reception room, this committee will also specially designate a good location for the press seats, but they must not enter the sports circle. (3) Each newspaper and news agency must designate one person to be responsible for contact. (4) This group will prepare a news box in the press reception room. Each registered reporter will have a box, and this group will print various news announcements and results every day and immediately distribute them into the boxes for the reporters to send out themselves. (D) Reporting methods: (1) A broadcasting station will be set up in the field to report the results at any time, and all seven fields can be heard. (2) The Central Broadcasting Radio Station is required to report twice a day at noon and in the evening. (3) A blackboard will be installed in front of the press seats to display records at any time. (4) Report cards will be used to report in the field by a bicycle team. (E) Regarding the advertising section: (1) External publicity and advertising: The sports meeting is not only for athletes, but also to encourage the audience to actively participate. Therefore, this group has compiled and printed various colored pictures and slogans and distributed them to the whole country for posting to arouse public interest. (2) Other billboards will be handled as appropriate depending on the needs. (3) Solicit advertisements in the conference's order book, manual, and special issue, and use the income to widely print colored pictures, slogans, and other publicity materials. (4) In order to promote national products, it is planned to solicit national product merchants to post billboards around the inside and outside of the sports field, etc., which are all completely made and very convenient. (3) Editing section: (1) Print a special issue of the conference every day, one large sheet, reporting news announcements, results records, etc., printing 100,000 copies every day. (2) The conference's order book is the most needed item for participants and audiences. The committee has designed and printed it, totaling 300,000 to 400,000 copies, each with 240 pages (120 pages), in 16-size newspaper, beautifully printed and rich in content. A printing fee will be charged as appropriate in the future. The conference manual and tour guide are the most needed items for athletes and referees. It is a diary or can be used as a notebook, containing various regulations, organizations, and tour guides, etc., which is very convenient. It has now been completed and will be printed with 10,000 copies for application. The work of this group is roughly as described above. I have not been in the news business before, but the success or failure of this conference depends half on publicity. Therefore, I dare to ask for advice from senior figures in the news media with twelve points of sincerity. I will accept it sincerely. When you come to Beijing to participate in the future, I will do my best to be a good host and treat you with sincerity. I hope that you will give practical assistance and make widespread publicity before and during the meeting, and the success of the meeting will be due to you.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Press's Requirements for the Conference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai press has the following requirements for this conference: (1) The conference should cooperate with the press to achieve the most accurate and satisfactory results. (2) For hard news (i.e., all the results that should be available), the conference should send out public telegrams, as was done at the North China Games. The Shanghai Daily Press Association will contact you in writing again in the future. (3) The conference should provide vehicles for transportation to and from the venue.</p>
<h3>Conference Preparations, Accommodation, etc.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondent) In order to embellish the grand event and awaken the public to save the country through aviation, the National Games has requested the Aviation Department to send planes to circle the venue on the first day of the conference to perform skills, and to distribute conference declarations and leaflets. This has been approved by the department. In addition, the conference organizing committee, due to insufficient funds, plans to erect advertising billboards around the venue and solicit advertisements from national product stores, charging different fees to make up for the deficit. A number of stores have registered with the conference and are contacting them about advertising locations. As for transportation issues, because a large number of long-distance buses are needed, the official authorities cannot prepare them, and it has been decided to solicit bids from merchants to contract for them. The issue of food and accommodation for athletes and conference staff has been addressed by designating the gymnasium of the Central Sports Field as the male athletes' dormitory, and using various girls' schools in Beijing as places to provide food and accommodation for female athletes from various provinces.</p>
<h3>Japan 2-3 Eliminated Portugal to Win Rotary Cup Tennis Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Portugal and Japan Each Won a Set of Singles Matches China Again Won a Set of Singles Against the United States The Rotary Cup International Tennis Championships will see China and Portugal compete for the final title from Friday of this week. Yesterday was the third day of the quarter-finals. The battle between Portugal and Japan was related to who would gain the right to play in the finals. As a result, each side won a set of singles matches. H. Collas defeated Suto in straight sets, while Machida defeated Marcel in straight sets, resulting in a 3-2 victory for Portugal, eliminating Japan and granting Portugal the right to play in the finals. After Portugal won the doubles match the day before, they held a 2-1 lead. The match between Wang Wenzheng and Schuar was not relevant to the victory. China had already eliminated the United States 3-0. As a result, Wang Wenzheng won 3-1, and China and Portugal will hold the finals starting this Friday.</p>
<h3>Portugal and Japan Each Won One of the Last Two Singles Matches</h3>
<p>Collas Again Defeats Suto Collas defeated Machida 3-2 on the first day, giving Portugal infinite hope in the quarter-finals. After winning the doubles match the day before, Portugal's hope was even more steady. After all, Suto was no match for Collas. Sure enough, the result was straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. Suto only held a 3-2 lead in the first set, and followed from behind. Collas was nimble and quick, and his shots were steady and powerful. Suto's strength was still lacking and he was rarely able to respond. With Collas's victory, Portugal won the right to play in the finals.</p>
<p>H. Collas (Portugal) {6-3, 6-3, 6-1} Suto (Japan)</p>
<p>Machida Submits to Marcel Although Machida defeated Marcel, it could not save Japan, but only comforted himself. The result was 6-4, 6-0, 6-1, and the entanglement between the two sides was the longest. Long rallies and long shots only showed the back and forth. Machida played steadily and did not take risks. Marcel also dealt with it carefully, but ultimately lacked confidence. Shots out of bounds and touches of the net left him unable to recover. This was the longest-held game yesterday.</p>
<p>Machida (Japan) {6-4, 6-0, 6-1} Marcel (Portugal)</p>
<h3>China Again Wins a Singles Match Against the United States</h3>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Defeats Schuar In the last two singles matches between China and the United States, which were irrelevant to the victory, China again won one of them yesterday. There is still one set to be played today to complete the match. Yesterday, Wang Wenzheng defeated Schuar 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. Sch yesterday's performance was full of vitality and had the qualifications to fight, so that Wang Wenzheng actually failed in the first set. Sch served first and Wang won it, and also won the next game, but Schuar suddenly cheered up and won three cities in a row, leading 3-2, then 4-3. Although Wang Wenzheng won his own serve at this time, he was defeated by Sch winning two games in a row and getting the first set, 6-4. Although the second and third sets were won by Wang, they also went through fierce battles. In the second set, Sch once led 4-3, but the result was 6-4, fortunately Wang won three games in a row. In the third set, Sch also led 3-2, but the result was 6-3. In the last set, Sch was completely defeated.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (China) {4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1} Schuar (USA)</p>

<h3>Discussion on Jiao Yitang's Open Letter to the Nation Regarding the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Furthermore, the impact on public health is also extremely significant. The improvement and construction of public health almost entirely rely on medical statistics as a standard. However, medical statistics almost entirely depend on reports from practicing physicians. The value of these reports hinges on the accuracy of the diagnoses. If the diagnoses are inaccurate, the reports will naturally be inaccurate as well. Consequently, the statistical results will also be incorrect. In that case, the true picture of the rise and fall of major diseases in society, and the impact of social systems and customs on these diseases, will be impossible to accurately ascertain. As a result, public health policies and plans will have no reliable basis for their determination. For example, if tuberculosis increases day by day, the overall vitality of society will decline day by day, and social costs will increase day by day. This is the impact of tuberculosis on society. Therefore, tuberculosis has become a very significant social problem. Conversely, the impact of social systems and customs on tuberculosis is also very significant. Which occupation has the highest incidence of tuberculosis? What is the relationship with nutrition? What is the relationship with economics? During which period of the year is the incidence rate highest? During which period is the mortality rate highest? During which period is the worsening most frequent? During which period is hemoptysis most frequent? Moreover, is there a definite relationship between these peak or minimum periods and changes in air temperature, newly available food and drink, special accidents, and other epidemics? In addition, what are the relationships with gender, age, and other factors? If accurate investigations can be conducted and compiled statistically, then the impact of social phenomena on tuberculosis can be clearly revealed. Then, which systems should be reformed, which habits should be corrected, and which matters should be prohibited can all be clearly told to us through statistics. Only then will the advancement of health administration have a path to follow. From this, we can see that investigation and statistics are of exceptional value to the health of the people. If diagnoses are inaccurate, then this false statistics cannot be used at all. Moreover, based on this false statistics, we will misidentify the target and go down the wrong path, making the situation like plunging deeper into water or getting hotter in fire. In short, it is no secret that inaccurate diagnoses and false treatments harm individual patients. They also greatly hinder the development of medicine itself and pose a great danger to the future of public health. On this single point, the sins of national medicine seem to be already exceedingly profound.</p>
<p>Fourth point: Strict disinfection. The importance of this matter for the preservation of life and the spread of epidemics and infectious diseases is thoroughly understood by everyone and needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "The shortcoming of Western medicine is its excessive mechanical view. In the eyes of Western medicine, there is almost no regard for the whole person. Because Western medicine has this view, it is bound to lead to treating a headache by treating the head and treating a footache by treating the foot. National medicine can concretely use decoctions to cure many internal tumors, such as lung abscesses and intestinal abscesses. Western medicine only uses surgery locally. Now, a certain important person has a carbuncle on his back, and after Western medicine cut and drained the pus, it was sutured. In less than ten days, another ulcer appeared, and it still cannot heal." Alas, Mr. Jiao! You seem to be too unclear. From a theoretical point of view, in the two thousand years of your national medicine's techniques, which person, which book, has discussed fundamental cures or causal treatments? In the prescriptions of Zhang Zhongjing, which formula does not treat a headache by treating the head and a footache by treating the foot? "If thirsty, remove Banxia," "If vomiting, add Banxia and Shengjiang," "If abdominal pain, remove Huangqin and add Shaoyao," "If difficulty urinating, add Fuling," "If no sweat, administer Mahuang Tang," "If sweating, administer Guizhi Tang," "If dry stool, administer Chengqi Tang," and "For Taiyang disease with body pain and a deep and slow pulse after sweating, administer Guizhi Jia Shaoyao Shengjiang Ge Yi Liang, Renshen San Liang, Xinjia Tang," "For abdominal distension after sweating, administer Houpu Shengjiang Gancao Banxia Renshen Tang," "If the disease does not resolve after sweating and chills return, administer Shaoyao Gancao Fuzi Tang," "If no chills, administer Tiaowei Chengqi Tang," etc. Which of these is not a case of treating a headache by treating the head and a footache by treating the foot? The most laughable thing is the last part of the twelfth section on phlegm, fluid retention, and cough in the Jingui Yaolue, which says: "For cough with dyspnea, leaning to breathe, unable to lie down, administer Xiaoqinglong Tang. After administering Xiaoqinglong Tang, with excessive spitting, a deep cun pulse, a faint chi pulse, cold hands and feet, qi rushing upwards from the lower abdomen to the chest and throat, numbness in the hands and feet, and a flushed face as if drunk... If urination is difficult and fainting occurs from time to time, administer Fuling Guizhi Wuwei Gancao Tang to treat the qi rushing upwards. When the rushing qi subsides but coughing and chest fullness worsen, use Guiling Wuwei Gancao Tang, remove Guizhi and add Shengjiang and Xixin to treat the cough and fullness. When the cough and fullness stop but thirst and rushing qi return, it is because Xixin and Ganjiang are hot herbs. If the fullness should increase after taking them but the thirst stops instead, it is fluid retention. For fluid retention, fainting is indicated, and vomiting is inevitable. For vomiting, add Banxia again to remove the water. When the water is removed and the vomiting stops, if the person is swollen, add Xingren...". After reading this medical case, it feels fragmented, mixed up, neglecting this and attending to that, looking ahead and forgetting the rear, treating one symptom with one herb, and the drawbacks after using the herbs are endless. Zhang Zhongjing's flustered, dead-end state is vividly portrayed on paper. May I ask Mr. Jiao and the people of the nation, is this not evidence of treating a headache by treating the head and a footache by treating the foot? Alas! People with clear minds do not need to be told in detail. With undeveloped material civilization, unfavorable equipment, and inaccurate diagnoses, how can your national medicine discuss fundamental cures or causal treatments? Naturally, you cannot help but regard treating a headache by treating the head and a footache by treating the foot as satisfactory, and there are also many errors of treating a headache by treating the foot and a footache by treating the head. Mr. Jiao, to accuse us in reverse is truly laughable. (To be continued)</p>

A: Amoebae are a type of protozoa, with the scientific name Amoeba. The amoeba that causes this type of dysentery is just one kind, called Entamoeba Histolytica. It is a single-celled small animal. When stationary, it can be distinguished into inner and outer layers of protoplasm. When moving, it extends pseudopods from the cell, hence the name.</p>
<p>Q: Is the occurrence of this disease related to the season and location?</p>
<p>A: It is most common in summer and autumn. In tropical and subtropical regions, this type of dysentery often occurs. Q: Which part of the intestines do amoebae invade, and how do they invade?</p>
<p>A: They invade the cecum and rectum of the large intestine, causing ulcers on the mucous membrane, and especially invading the deeper layers of the mucous membrane. This is different from bacterial dysentery. Q: How many days after infection with amoebae does the disease develop? A: The disease develops after an incubation period of one to twenty-one days. Q: What are the symptoms of amebic dysentery?</p>
<p>A: It can be divided into acute and chronic types. Q: What are the symptoms of the acute type? A: The acute type suddenly begins within one or two days with loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, etc., followed by pain and diarrhea in the lower abdomen. Initially, watery, mucus-like stools are passed, alternating with fecal matter. Later, the stool loses its fecal nature and becomes purely mucus-like stool or even mucus-like bloody stool. The patient may experience tenesmus and urgency, up to ten to twenty times a day. The body temperature rises to a moderate degree, and the fever mostly subsides within a week, and the symptoms lessen, transitioning to the chronic type. Q: What about the chronic type? A: Chronic amebic dysentery mostly develops from the acute phase, and it can also revert to the acute type. Therefore, the disease progresses and regresses, and after several years, the patient is emaciated, anemic, and has edema in the lower limbs. The stool is passed once or twice a day with a putrid odor, and the lower abdomen is distended. In the descending colon, sigmoid colon, or cecum, a cord-like resistance may be felt. Q: Do patients with amebic dysentery develop complications? A: Yes, they do. The most common and dangerous complication is liver abscess. Sometimes the abscess is the size of a chicken egg or a child's head, causing swelling and tenderness of the liver, accompanied by chills, rigors, or intermittent fever, or jaundice. Other complications include metastasis to the lungs and brain. Q: What are the sequelae of this disease after it has been contracted? A: There are cicatricial strictures of the intestines, adhesions, twisting, and incomplete closure of the ileocecal valve, etc. Q: How can it be determined that it is amebic dysentery? A: From the blood-tinged mucous stool, cachexia, liver abscess, etc. of patients with endemic diseases, it can be inferred. The most reliable method is to detect Entamoeba histolytica in the stool. Q: How dangerous is this type of dysentery? A: If complications do not occur, it is not very dangerous. However, the chronic type is very difficult to treat. Q: What is the treatment approach for amebic dysentery? A: The treatment can follow the same approach as for bacterial dysentery. However, there is a specific drug for amebic dysentery, which is the injection of emetine hydrochloride, which is very effective. In addition, oral administration of Yatrenro5 tablets or Dysentulin tablets, or enema with a 1% aqueous solution of Yatren powder, are also quite effective. Recently, oral administration of Capsules of Cerpersene has also been used and is quite good.</p>
<h3>Determining Whether Gonorrhea is Cured</h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>People often mistakenly believe that once the acute symptoms of gonorrhea have subsided, the pain has lessened, and the discharge has decreased, the gonorrhea has been cured. Furthermore, some people take a bit of urine to the health bureau for examination, and if no gonococci are found, they consider it proof that the gonorrhea has been cured, but this is also a mistake. In chronic gonorrhea, the gonococci often lurk in the tissue under the urethral mucous membrane, urethral glands, prostate, and other lesions (lesions are where bacteria lurk). They do not necessarily appear in the urine all the time, so it is not easy to find gonococci by examining only a bit of urine. A careless diagnosis of a cure delays the patient's treatment and poses a risk of transmission to others. Therefore, we should seek an appropriate standard to follow to avoid the above risks. Here are three methods selected by German medical doctor Ye Dasong for determining whether there are no gonococci in the body. I will explain them briefly, but I will not elaborate on the specialized aspects. I will simply let the public know that the determination of whether gonorrhea is cured is done in this way.</p>
<p>First, the gonococcal provocation test; second, the gonococcal culture method; and third, the complement fixation test. First, the gonococcal provocation test: What is the gonococcal provocation test? It is that when gonorrhea becomes chronic, as mentioned above, the gonococci often lurk in the lesions. If they are not stimulated, they will not be detected. Now, we use a method called provocation to stimulate them, and they will come out, making it easier for us to find them, like "startling a snake in the grass." There are many ways to provoke them, which I will describe in sections below:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanical provocation: This is the method of inserting a metal "buqi" or dilator into the urethra. (2) Chemical provocation: This is the method of injecting a medicinal solution into the urethra.</p>
<p>(3) Specific provocation: This is the method of injecting gonococcal vaccine.</p>
<p>(4) Non-specific provocation: This is the method of injecting autologous serum or milk preparations.</p>
<p>(5) Alcohol consumption: This is the method of having the patient drink alcohol. (6) Labor: This is the method of having the patient engage in labor such as riding a horse or dancing.</p>
<p>Second, the gonococcal culture method: This is the method of culturing the secretions, but the procedure for gonococcal culture is very troublesome and requires certain equipment.</p>
<p>Third, the complement fixation test: This method has not yet reached a fully reliable stage and is still under research. The urethral secretions obtained by using the gonococcal provocation method described above are examined carefully under a microscope. If no gonococci are found, and the culture is also negative, it can generally be considered that the gonorrhea is cured. However, one test is not enough, and repeated tests are necessary. As for the various methods mentioned above, some use only one method, while others use two, three, or four methods in combination. This is to be decided according to the doctor's wishes. There is also a very important point to note: under what circumstances can the provocation method be used for gonorrhea? This is very important to the patient's well-being. If the provocation method is misused, it can have very dangerous consequences, which requires special attention.</p>
<h3>Scientific Childbearing (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>㈡㈩㈥ Management of Twin Pregnancy</p>
<p>A. Why have twins?</p>
<p>The female reproductive cell, the ovum, only matures once every four weeks. It is rare for two to mature at the same time. If two ova mature simultaneously and each combines with a male sperm, then conception occurs. After conception, they develop similarly, and twins are formed. Twin pregnancy differs from normal pregnancy in the following ways: The abdomen is more distended than in a normal pregnancy.</p>
<p>There is more edema.</p>
<p>Breathing is particularly difficult. Nausea is more severe. Two distinct fetal heart sounds can be heard in the abdomen. The development of twins is slower than in a normal pregnancy. A depression can be felt between the two fetuses.</p>
<p>B. Precautions during delivery of twins</p>
<p>The labor pains in twin pregnancy are quite weak and prolonged because the fetus is sometimes positioned with the umbilical cord, hands, or feet coming out first. Also, because the uterine contractions are not very good, uterine bleeding and eclampsia may occur. The mortality rate for twins is about five to seven out of every hundred, which is about twice the mortality rate for normal infants. This is because about a quarter of twin pregnancies result in premature birth. Even if it is not a premature birth and reaches full term, the fetus may not develop completely in the uterus. When labor begins, there may be cases of underdevelopment and death.</p>
<p>Twin pregnancy also carries the above-mentioned risks for the mother during pregnancy and delivery. After delivery, puerperal fever is more likely to occur than in normal mothers. According to statistics, about three or four out of every hundred women with twin pregnancies die. Therefore, after pregnancy, if the abdomen is excessively large, or if urination or defecation is obstructed, or if edema is found in the lower abdomen and feet, then it is either twins, polyhydramnios, or another symptom. Medical attention should be sought as soon as possible to determine the truth. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Retrospective View of Medicine and Pharmacy in Shanghai Over the Past Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications Section 1: New Medical and Pharmaceutical Education In our China, medicine and pharmacy have always been grouped together with divination and astrology. As mentioned repeatedly above, medical and pharmaceutical education has never received much attention. Even during the late Qing Dynasty's reforms and school building, there was still the idea of valuing scholars and belittling doctors. I remember that a female teacher in a Shanghai girls' school was publicly criticized and expelled from the academic community by the conservative faction for some minor matter. However, this person went to Japan to study medicine and then returned to practice medicine in obscurity. This shows that both the expelled and the expellers at the time viewed the medical community as completely different from the academic community. Before the Republic of China, new medical and pharmaceutical education institutions were very underdeveloped. The way students were admitted to the hospitals run by various churches was still similar to the apprentice style of traditional medicine. Although there were a few medical schools and military medical schools in Beiyang, Shanghai, Hunan, and Shandong, there were very few that were purely Chinese-run. Later, fortunately, the system of establishing medical specialty schools in various provinces was advocated for a time, and only then did new medical and pharmaceutical education have some foundation. It could only be called a budding stage. If it weren't for those students who studied in Japan and returned to the country, adopting the Japanese system and doing this transitional work, I'm afraid that to this day, we in China would only have one or two self-run medical schools. The large-scale source of medical and pharmaceutical talent would still come from only two avenues: one, students returning directly from studying abroad, and two, trainees in church hospitals in this country under the protection of foreigners. According to today's trends, these two types of people have different levels and difficulties in cooperation. Even if foreigners come to China to run new-style schools, they are only creating some self-aggrandizing aristocratic doctors in the midst of cultural aggression, and how much contribution do they make to new medicine and pharmacy in the whole of China? Recently, in the new medical and pharmaceutical community, two different views have inevitably emerged regarding medical education. Some people, having become accustomed to modern medicine and pharmacy in Europe and the United States, feel that the medical specialty school system of the early Republic of China is close to being crudely made and of too shallow a level. They want to catch up with foreign countries head-on. Other people are deeply aware of the lack of new medicine across the country and still advocate using the medical specialty school system to supplement the university system, so that output can be increased and new theories can penetrate into the people. Then, they can move forward from this shallow foundation. Let's estimate the state of medical and pharmaceutical education across the country, and then we can understand what to do and where to go. Since the last decade, with reorganizations, closures, and new openings, the level may be slightly higher than in the previous decade. In terms of quantity, there are still only twenty-eight medical and pharmaceutical education institutions in the country. Among them, there are several that borrow the power of foreigners and hang up a Chinese sign. Let's not talk about them for the time being. However, to be fair, given the vastness of China and the large number of people, even if these twenty-eight schools produce a large number of students each year, it can only be called a moderate embellishment, not an adequate supply. Moreover, a portion of these graduates become teachers and researchers, and another portion become public health administrators. There are even fewer who can develop new medicine and pharmacy for the common people. According to the social economy and social level I described in the previous chapters, it can be asserted that even a well-qualified medical specialty school graduate cannot fully exert what he has learned in his urban practice, let alone in rural areas. Therefore, all the finely made doctors are bound to make a living among the aristocracy. What is the difference between that and the students who studied abroad? In other words, what is the difference from foreigners? Furthermore, quack doctors are now proliferating, and traditional doctors are rampant. If we follow the fine-making approach, then on the one hand, the new medical and pharmaceutical community is bound to become a situation of peaceful corner, allowing a group of muddle-headed politicians, like Ting Yitang, to calmly promote his corrupt ideas and advocate for some national medicine regulations. On the other hand, due to the ignorant needs of society, those quack doctors continue to emerge endlessly. A small number of highly trained talents are not enough to seize the seats of quack doctors, nor do they deign to do so. They want to train quack doctors and bring them into the right track, but I am afraid that the effort will be doubled with half the result.</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Pharmacy Business (1)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Pharmacies were originally equivalent to hospitals in name, because hospitals are institutions where doctors treat diseases for others, and pharmacies are specialized stores where pharmacists dispense medicines for patients to fulfill the doctor's purpose of treating diseases. Moreover, for the convenience of patients obtaining medicine, they are widely established in various parts of the marketplace. Judging from their business nature, they are specialized vocational stores, supplemented by skills, serving society, and seeking their own due compensation as profit. This is not comparable to an ordinary store that only needs to sell goods and obtain surplus goods as profit. This is the true meaning of pharmacy business. In the marketplaces of various countries, so-called formal pharmacies are all like this, and they are under the management of national laws, which enhances their business status and distinguishes them from general ordinary stores that only need capital to be opened at will. Now, I will present the current situation of pharmacies in various parts of Europe to glimpse the true meaning of their business and introduce it to my new pharmaceutical colleagues in our country, which should be the wish of my colleagues.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Business in England</p>
<p>Great Britain has 42.5 million residents, and the number of pharmacists is in a ratio of one to four thousand with the residents, that is, there are more than 10,000 people. The British capital has 2,000 pharmacists and 150 pharmacies, distributed among 8.5 million residents, and the ratio is also one to four thousand. The national law for managing the pharmaceutical industry is strictly enforced, similar to the American law for managing food, drugs, and poisons. The medicines sold are naturally based on the British Pharmacopoeia as the standard, such as the testing methods for the refinement and content of medicines, which are all in accordance with the regulations of the Pharmacopoeia. The formal pharmacy business hours are 9:00 am to 7:00 pm in cities and 9:00 am to 8:00 pm in towns. They are allowed to close for half a day each week, while ordinary drug stores are not subject to this restriction. The dispensing business is restricted by the National Insurance Act, and the drug prices only take a small profit. The dispensing fee is about four and a half pence per dose, and at most it is no more than five to six pence. Therefore, the drug prices set by pharmacists or pharmacies established by pharmacists in England are all subject to the government's constraints, presumably to provide for the social economy and the people's livelihood.

<h3>Random Jottings After a Diagnosis</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>One afternoon at four o'clock, I went to the Bi family for a house call. The patient was a twelve-year-old child. Their family was one of three supporting a single male. The family recounted: the child had been feverish for three days, talking nonsense last night. At seven in the morning, they called a Taoist priest, who said a demon had possessed the child. He drew a talisman, made talisman water, and sprinkled it on the child, but it didn't help much. At eight o'clock, they summoned a practitioner of Zhuyou, but that was also ineffective. At nine o'clock, they asked a local doctor to take a look, who prescribed a decoction of Forsythia and Gardenia, but it didn't work either. At twelve o'clock, they called another famous doctor, who prescribed a Qinglong Baihu decoction with only five ingredients, claiming it was an ancient formula. However, after taking it, not only was it ineffective, but the child also started convulsing. At two o'clock, they had to call a German doctor, who gave an injection, which slightly improved the convulsions, but the nostrils continued to flare rapidly. Doctor, please take a look, is this child in critical condition? You see, within eight hours, they re-enacted the entire three-thousand-year history of Chinese medicine. Isn't this a joke? They started with remedies from the warm disease debates of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and finally resorted to 20th-century injection methods. This is because Shanghai has the convenience of being a place where people from all directions reside. In their eagerness to protect their child, they subjected the twelve-year-old to the bitter experience of a three-thousand-year historical drama within eight hours. Such a hasty approach is rarely seen in the world. However, dear readers, although it is rare to see such a bizarre example of re-enacting history in eight hours, stories of re-enacting history within eight days are commonly heard and seen in modern families. Fundamentally, they lack the ability to recognize medicine and doctors. Once the illness becomes severe, they panic and become flustered. A relative recommends a doctor, believing him to be good, so they give it a try. A friend recommends a massage, thinking it might be effective. When all else fails, the servants say, "There's a Japanese doctor in a certain place who uses Qi-healing techniques, pressing with bamboo tubes, and it's very effective." So they invite him to try it out. The result is that if it's a false or mild illness that can naturally heal even if superficially aggravated, then whoever happens to be the doctor at that time is considered lucky and said to have cured the illness. If it's a genuinely serious illness, and there isn't a truly responsible and dedicated doctor to treat the patient, it will inevitably lead to an incurable state. Isn't this the greatest of farces? They initially summoned a witch doctor from Sangtian, emulating the blind-man-examining-the-elephant trick from the time of Duke Jing of Jin. The second time, they emulated the emergency prescriptions and thousand-gold formulas from the Jin and Tang dynasties. Within it all lies a tragedy.</p>
<p>Now, the contradictory nature of Chinese society, as revealed in most facts, makes you wonder whether you should feel indignant, but it actually carries some elements of comedy. If you call it a comedy, it has a few traces of sadness. Zhuangzi said, "The beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are all confused and disordered, how can I know the difference?" I also say that the mixture of comedy and tragedy is precisely the cause of indignation for those with a heart for the world. How can I not argue? (To be continued)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Even Women Can't Do It</h3>
<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang only admires the "Analects" and doesn't worship Mencius, so he wants to let women take a shot at governing. In fact, Mencius said, "Those who nurture life are not enough to handle great matters; only those who arrange death can handle great matters." Women only know how to "nurture life" and don't know how to "arrange death," so how can they be called upon to govern the world!</p>
<p>If "nurturing life" is done too much, there will be a problem of overpopulation. Then people will fight and seize from each other, and the world will be in chaos. There must be someone to implement a death-arranging policy, calling on everyone to go die in batches, leaving only themselves untouched. This can only be done by men. Therefore, civil and military officials are all handled by men, which is not without merit. Of course, not all men are like this; for example, Romain Rolland, whom Mr. Lin Yutang mentioned, is not included.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle, one can see that disarmament conferences, world economic conferences, alliances to abolish civil war, etc., are just tricks that men play on women. They themselves are clear-headed: only "arranging death" can govern a country and pacify the world! To arrange death means sending others to die for oneself. Just say that most "others" are unwilling to die, so inviting compassionate women to govern is also not feasible. Lin Daiyu said, "It's either the east wind overpowering the west wind, or the west wind overpowering the east wind." This means that the "civil war" in the female world will never cease. Although women don't use machine guns when fighting, it's still terrible when they scratch each other's faces at the slightest provocation. Moreover, between the "east wind" and the "west wind," there is another kind of woman who specializes in provoking, instigating, and gossiping. In short, quarrels and fights are also the national essence of countries governed by women, and they will be even more intense. Therefore, if women were to rule, the world would still not be peaceful, and our ears would never be quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>People think that the chaos in the world is due to men's love of fighting, but that's not the real reason. The reason is that the fighting is not thorough enough, and the real enemies are not clearly identified. If the enemies are clearly identified, and they don't just shout slogans like women, but can fight hard battles, then perhaps the seed of men and women who love fighting will be wiped out. But women are mostly the third kind: they fall to the west when the east wind blows, and fall to the east when the west wind blows, leading to cycles of revenge without end. At the same time, because they fall so quickly, every battle is never thorough, and because they mostly can't clearly identify the enemies, there is only endless entanglement and no clearing of accounts. The men in power should actually be grateful to them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem with the world today is not that the rulers are men, but that men are ruling in the way of women. Governing the world with the way of concubines, how can the world not be in a mess?</p>
<p>To give a half-example: Wei Zhongxian of the Ming Dynasty was a eunuch! Half a woman, when he ruled the world, he made the people live in poverty, with "nurturing life" everywhere for his many adopted grandchildren, devouring people's flesh and shame like steamed buns. His fox and dog followers even supported him to be enshrined in the Confucian Temple and inherit the Daoist tradition. Half a woman's rule is already so terrible, let alone a whole woman's rule!</p>
<h3>Articles Written with Life</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>I happened to read Yesterday's Non-An's Daily Compendium and saw an entry inside: Mei Xun was a Hanlin Academician. One day, he was burdened with writing imperial decrees. He held his writing brush, walked down the stairs, and saw an old soldier lying in the sun, stretching comfortably. Mei sighed and said, "How pleasant!" Then he asked if the soldier could read. The soldier replied that he couldn't. Mei said, "Even happier!" Talking about the happiness of not knowing how to read is indeed very interesting from the perspective of someone who knows how to read. The habits of literati are mostly the same. No matter in ancient times or modern times, in China or abroad, all comrades who wield the pen deeply resent themselves and regret that they shouldn't have taken this dead-end road.</p>
<p>But Mei Xun was someone who had achieved success with his pen. Having already produced such works, it seemed he could be content. However, upon seeing an old soldier stretching, he was so envious, simply because he had to write "By Imperial Decree" every day, wielding his own pen to write other people's articles, and he felt somewhat weary.</p>
<p>In reality, to be able to produce entirely one's own articles with a pen is not only hindered during the "Imperial Majesty" era, but also similarly impossible now.</p>
<p>If one truly wants to write one's own articles, it's better not to wield the pen! Like that old soldier, although he couldn't read, he lived a whole life, which was a grand article. Stretching in the sun was an especially brilliant touch. Even the proud son of the "scholar-official class" had to praise, "How pleasant!"</p>
<p>This made me think of Arishima Takeo's "Articles Written with Life" in "Art and Life," which is quite similar to that old soldier. However, he mentioned Sakyamuni, Christ, and Socrates, the three who are called the three sages of the world. They never personally wrote anything for posterity. The teachings they left behind were mostly opinions given at any time and place, and casual conversations after tea and wine. These were the grand articles that contained their great thoughts and illuminated the world for future generations.</p>
<p>The articles containing the thoughts of Sakyamuni, Christ, and Socrates were imprinted on the minds of our ancestors in the past, are now imprinted on our minds, and will continue to be imprinted on the minds of our descendants for generations to come. However, that old soldier and those articles like him have long been destroyed along with their lives.</p>
<p>The reason for this is naturally because articles like the old soldier's are relatively mediocre and have too little connection with the times and society. But whether it is permanent or temporary, the article is still his.</p>
<p>All articles written with life are one's own articles!</p>
<h3>On "Educational Novels"</h3>
<p>Mr. Lie Wen:</p>
<p>I returned to Shanghai yesterday and will be traveling far again tomorrow. Many things need to be dealt with urgently, so I will not be able to give a detailed reply to Mr. Shi Heng's article published in today's "Free Talk." Moreover, where I am going, mail will be inconvenient and newspapers will be difficult to see. Therefore, I can only explain a few points in principle.</p>
<p>First, in the beginning section, Mr. Shi Heng pointed out that he "cannot agree" with both the broad and narrow "definitions" of the term "educational novel," but he did not offer a new definition beyond disagreeing. What he calls a "clear concept" is still fundamentally unresolved. In fact, Mr. Shi Heng has become one of those "not only Mr. Feng Wu, but many people are unable to" understand. The reason for this, according to Mr. Shi Heng's article, is probably that he did not clarify the difference between "educational novel" and "the educational significance of novels." If he clarified this, I think he would not have this broad and narrow debate. Second, he pointed out that my first error in the "Educational Novels" essay was to consider "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" as an educational novel (he said this is "speaking slightly strictly"). If he were not "slightly" strict, I wonder if he would consider it an "educational novel?" His reason is that "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" greatly depicts a kind of typical people, and this kind of method of vividly separating the characters and the background of class life, only examining the depicted characters purely, and suspending the characters in mid-air, is truly "inevitably" impure characterism. I don't know how Mr. Shi Heng explains the source of the characters' thoughts and actions in such a judgment in the work. Moreover, because "the school supervisor and Ding Geng are both special typical people and cannot represent all school supervisors and all students," he cannot call it an "educational novel." I don't know why "special typical people" must be forcibly pulled out of that kind of living environment, and why they must "represent everything" before the characters in the postal class living environment do not have to be pulled? Mr. Shi Heng also knows from that point in "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" that "the author did not intend to make these two kinds of people and this story possible only in school life." If there is no basis for this kind of judgment, it is undoubtedly completely idealistic and completely conceptual. Furthermore, Mr. Shi Heng said, "Taking the expression of conscience condemnation as a method of education, and even asking whether this kind of doctrine can solve the problem of education, is even more wrong." "Presumably his reason is that "the correct method of creation should not lead to the question of whether the doctrine of conscience condemnation can solve the problem. The correct method of creation has nothing to do with whether it can actually solve the problem." Here, the problem of the recognition of the term "creation method" clearly exists between Mr. Shi Heng and me. If I am a bourgeois writer, then my recognition of the term "creation method" is limited to the form of the work; but I am not like this, my understanding is that "creation method" should be talked about from the author's "point of view," I am not a dualist of content and form. Which aspect does Mr. Shi Heng's understanding of the term "creation method" belong to? If it belongs to the former, then of course he should oppose my argument; if it belongs to the latter, then where exactly is my "Educational Novels" essay "even more wrong?" I completely don't understand. "And the author certainly did not want to use this trick to solve the problem," this is "indeed," but I, in the "Educational Novels" essay, where did I explain that the author of "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" wanted to "use this trick to solve the problem?" I really hope that Mr. Shi Heng can point it out. The meaning of my writing the "Educational Novels" essay is very clear, it is not to criticize "Outside the Great Compassion Temple," it is only to use this novel as an example. I am emphasizing that I am against depicting education separately from political relations, and against the current method of using force to solve student strikes. Therefore, whether this novel reflects reality or the depiction of the transformation process is not enough, etc., is irrelevant to my "Educational Novels" essay, I don't want to say anything. As for Mr. Shi Heng's "that short article" of mine "that does not need to be pointed out in this way," finally because of "the errors caused by the currently popular idealistic literary theory, which are extremely harmful and must be spoken out," and gave me the good intention of criticism, what can I say besides gratitude? Who exactly is the idealist?</p>
<p>This is all I want to state simply. Who exactly is the idealist, let the readers judge, I think Mr. Shi Heng may have more advice. However, I will not see it before I return to Shanghai. If there is any forgiveness for Mr. Shi Heng's article at that time, please forgive me. Mr. Lie Wen, due to time constraints, I can only write this letter to you in a hurry. I hope it can be published as soon as possible. Sincerely, I wish you</p>
<p>good health. Feng Wu, 3:00 AM, August 18th.</p>
<h3>Life and Machine (4)</h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>"The hell with tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Good, let's go."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he had energy, like an old gun that had just been given a shot of morphine, full of strength. The two rolled up their straw mats, humming a sensual little tune, intentionally staggering as they left. The song disappeared far away in the clang of the streetcar bell. The person lying on the mat sneezed, and the person whose back was kissing the floor looked at their backs with envy.</p>
<p>The night gradually deepened, and the cars on the road slowly thinned out. Finally, only a few ghostly patrolmen lingered on the road. The air was calm, and in the heart of the river, large ships were docked at the floating pontoons, the lights on their masts reflecting in the water like long, dancing golden snakes.</p>
<p>In the corner towards the west, lying on old newspapers, was a naked child, his belly covered with a piece of moldy rag. He was breathing heavily through his nostrils, his thin body tossing and turning. Ah, is it also a lewd heart that beats beneath that small chest? No, because those big eyes are filled with crystal tears. The smooth, brown little shoulders twitched from time to time, and the tears, like pearls, passed through the short journey in the dimly lit air and dripped onto the newspaper::::</p>
<p>Those with white hair and no beards went to dreamland one by one. What remained were all strong or thin young men, some grinding their teeth, some cursing dirty words, some sitting up, untying the bamboo tag or straw rope worn with the bamboo tag (Note: Each time a coolie transports goods, they can get a bamboo tag, which is divided into three kinds: ten texts, twenty texts, and twenty-four texts. At the pier, the use of bamboo tags is the same as copper coins.) and carefully counting the copper coins and bamboo tags, finally cursing someone else's mother twice with malice, and then falling back down in disappointment, their eyes wide open, looking at the sky with fatigue.</p>
<p>A black shadow suddenly stood up from the floor, his throat rumbling, "Pah!" and spat out a mouthful of bloody phlegm. Tuberculosis bacteria were active in his weak chest, exciting his nerves. He walked with staggering steps to the corner on the west, his eyes flashing fire in the darkness, every blood vessel filled with boiling blood. He squatted down, his bloodshot eyes staring at the child's bare flesh, and a feverish hand stroked the child's brown thigh, how delicate! As smooth as lard, he reached out and uncovered the cloth covering the child's belly and fell down:::::</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" The child woke up from his dream, struggling with sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>"Xiao Fang, little baby, my precious, don't move!" A series of trembling voices.</p>
<p>"Slap!" The child turned over, a crisp slap landing on the red and swollen face, and immediately jumped up. The black shadow lay back in the original place, disappointment, fatigue, the pain of spirit and flesh, forever remaining in his body, until the next morning.</p>
<p>The child went to another corner and lay down with a thud beside the man in old blue cloth pants who was snoring quietly. Sadness and anger squeezed the fragile little heart, and the chest felt like it was stuffed with something elastic. Unable to sleep, he had to sit up, breathing heavily through his throat and nose.</p>
<p>"Ah Song, hey!" The child patted the burly man in old blue cloth pants. "Is it dawn yet?" He turned over and sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking at the dark sky. In the sky, countless small stars were mischievously winking in the coal smoke. "It's still early, eh!" He said, and fell back down.</p>
<p>"Ah Song," a small hand patted the broad shoulder. "Don't sleep, eh!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" A strong arm pressed against the floor, slowly propping up the upper body.</p>
<p>"I'm asking you, am I destined to be unlucky?"</p>
<p>"Oh," a thick finger scratched the hedgehog-like head. "What are you saying?" "I'm saying," the child's voice trembled, "why am I always unlucky? I have no parents, no one cares about me, I get scolded on the street, I get kicked by the Indian guards on the cement floor, and when I'm starving, I fill my belly with things from the trash can. Luckily, old man Zhang::</p>

<h3>Understanding China's Current Economic Stage Chen Honggen</h3>
<p>What is an economic stage? It is the stage of economic development that a country or society has reached. However, because of the myriad of phenomena in society, it is extremely difficult to choose what we use to characterize each era. Some divide it according to the relationship between people and nature (such as F. List and Froose), into the eras of hunting and gathering, animal husbandry, agriculture, and industry and commerce. Others divide it according to the presence or absence of exchange relations (such as Hilperprenp) into the eras of self-sufficiency, direct exchange, and commodity circulation. Still others divide it according to the relationship between politics and economics (such as Schmoller) into the eras of village, urban, territorial, national, and world economy. However, from our perspective, all these classification methods are biased and fail to fully encompass the entire economic form of society. In recent years, scholars have proposed a new classification method, dividing it into the eras of primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, with capitalism further changing into the three eras of commercial, industrial, and financial capital. This theory is quite reasonable and is accepted by most scholars. We will follow it here.</p>
<p>Having established the classification of economic eras, we will further investigate the stage that China has reached at present. Because of the different perspectives of the commentators, the results obtained are different. Now, we will briefly present them to show the path of reform.</p>
<h3>(1) The End of the Feudal Economic Era</h3>
<p>The evidence cited includes: A. China has a large number of tenant farmers similar to serfs; B. There are various Likin taxes, rice bans, and consolidated taxes that restrict the local economy; C. The concepts of family and hometown are strong; D. China's ruling class is landlords; E. There are still many guild organizations in the interior. However, those who hold opposing views often attack it based on these proofs.</p>
<p>A. China's feudal era ended long ago! During the Qin Dynasty, the system of prefectures and counties replaced feudalism. The Prime Minister also elaborated on this in the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, the transition period to capitalism is very long. The Industrial Revolution has still not spread throughout the country, but it cannot be said that it is still in the feudal era.</p>
<p>(B) China's current ruling class is not landlords! China's feudal system was destroyed long ago, and it was also affected by the ancient land restriction system, the allotment system, and the inheritance by multiple sons. Finally, the distribution of land in China entered a more equal state. It is estimated that those with ten to twenty mu of land account for 70% of the total. In recent years, the number of small farmers with ten to twenty mu of land has increased again, while landlords with more than fifty mu of land have decreased day by day. Based on this, China does not have a large number of large landlords, and even more cannot be called its ruling class.</p>
<p>(C) China has more owner-farmers than tenant farmers! According to the facts, except for Guangdong, the number of owner-farmers in other provinces is several times greater than that of tenant farmers. The reason why Guangdong has this abnormal development is due to the dense population, high land prices, different soil quality, and other political relations. It cannot be said to represent the whole country.</p>
<p>D. Most of the restrictions on the local economy have been abolished! Since the National Government explicitly ordered the abolition of Likin taxes, all provinces have followed suit. What is listed here is only a small number of exceptions.</p>
<h3>(II) The Era of Industrial Capital</h3>
<p>The theory of feudalism is already inaccurate. Those who advance the theory of the era of industrial capital say: A. Large-scale industry already exists in coastal ports; B. The population of cities is expanding; C. Capital is concentrated; D. Financial capital is developed; E. The rural economy and small-scale handicrafts are collapsing.</p>
<p>However, this theory is not entirely believable; its truth or falsehood can be proven through objective analysis:</p>
<p>(A) The industries in coastal areas are very immature; according to customs reports, the quantity of machinery imported into China was 4,533,791 taels in the first year of the Republic (1912) and 22,952,127 (in gold units) in the twenty-first year (1932), which shows its slow development. Furthermore, foreign capital's influence in China's basic industries is extremely strong. Taking the textile industry as an example, the number of British and Japanese textile machines in China is almost equal to that of China. In terms of the size of capital, the total amount of Chinese and foreign capital is 4,500,000,000 yuan, of which Japanese capital accounts for as much as 3,000,000,000, which is astonishing. In terms of the coal mining industry, China's annual coal production is only 20 million tons. The slight increase in production in recent years is actually due to foreign capital's exploitation. China's investment is 26,160,000, which at first glance is several times that of foreign investment; but in the joint Chinese-foreign ventures, almost all the power belongs to foreigners, which must be clarified. Speaking of the steel industry, state-run enterprises have high costs, weak skills, and lack of capital, so they can hardly compete with foreign products; China's annual production of ore is about 1,500,000 tons, most of which is transported to Japan in its raw form, so the export of raw ore exceeds imports every year, while the import of steel exceeds exports. A check of the net import of metals and steel in the first year of the Republic was 18,242,082 customs taels, and by the nineteenth year (1930) it had increased to 84,850,295 customs taels, which shows the size of the leak. At the same time, the domestic steel industry is also controlled by the Japanese. In summary, it is clear that China's industry is immature and that foreign capital's influence is strong.</p>
<p>(B) The current surge in population in China's major cities is due to banditry in the countryside. The wealthy mostly move into cities or seek refuge in concessions, causing land prices to rise. This is a symptom of industrial decline and people's hardship; how can it be regarded as a sign of industrial and commercial development?</p>
<p>(C) Capital has indeed tended to concentrate in Shanghai in recent years. The reason for this is not due to the need for huge industrial capital, but to the accumulation of a large amount of commercial capital. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, banditry in the interior prevents Shanghai capital from being invested, and debts owed by the interior to Shanghai must be repaid in cash; on the other hand, due to the fall in silver prices, foreign profits are unwilling to be remitted back to their home countries, so they remain in Shanghai. At the same time, the wealthy own property and live in Shanghai to avoid trouble, which also causes inflation.</p>
<p>(D) The development of financial enterprises is also due to the lack of sufficient progress in industry and commerce; capital is abundant in the market, so it has to be invested in financial enterprises; and from the perspective of the banks themselves, the most dominant ones are foreign-funded banks. In terms of the number of banks, there are 141 Chinese banks and 63 foreign banks. In terms of capital, only the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and the National Goods Bank have capital of more than 10 million yuan, while there are as many as 17 foreign banks. The total capital of Chinese banks is only 600 million yuan, while foreign capital reaches 1.1 billion yuan. In terms of deposits, the amount of paper money issued, and investment, their power is either equal to or greater than that of Chinese banks.</p>
<p>(E) The bankruptcy of the rural economy is not due to the intrusion of industry, but to the ravages of banditry. Small-scale handicrafts still exist in many inland areas, and Zhabei in Shanghai is still a center of small-scale handicrafts.</p>
<h3>(III) The Era of Commercial Capital</h3>
<p>Some, seeing that the theory of industrial capital is too radical, propose a compromise, believing that China is still in the era of commercial capital. How can this be seen? (A) China's current commercial capital is greater than industrial capital. The recent proliferation of large and small department stores in cities is a prominent feature. (B) The inland areas still have a system of collecting merchants; in places where factories are not developed, merchants tend to collect products from various handicraft manufacturers for sale. (C) Small-scale handicrafts are gradually declining.</p>
<p>So, in what economic era is China actually in? The various theories of predecessors are both correct and incorrect. Why? Because from the perspective of its own development process, it should be in the era of commercial capital. However, due to the economic invasion of imperialism, it has partially progressed to the era of industrial capital, while other parts still retain traces of the previous era, and even the feudal era. This is why it is said that China is still in the feudal era, the commercial capital era, or the industrial capital era, all of which have their reasons. However, to use this to measure the entire reality is wrong.</p>
<p>Since China suffers from this unhealthy condition, how can it be saved? There are three ways: (1) Revitalize industry, (2) Rescue the countryside, (3) Revitalize industry and rescue the countryside.</p>
<p>Those who advocate industrialization say, "The twentieth century is the era of industrialization. Daily necessities are industrial products. If a country does not quickly industrialize itself to adapt to the world trend and meet the needs of the people, other countries will inevitably do it for it. Is this not proven by China's current situation? Therefore, if we want to save China's economic decline, that is, to fix the leak, there is no way other than industrialization."</p>
<p>However, those who advocate rescuing the countryside say, "The policy of industrialization cannot be implemented. China's capital is insufficient, restricted by unequal treaties, and tariffs cannot be completely autonomous. Domestic order is uneasy, which are all obstacles to industrial development. Moreover, China values agriculture. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's investigation, the ratio of farmers to the total population in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is 75%, in Anhui, Henan, Hunan, and Sichuan it is 30%, and in other provinces the lowest is 50%, with an average of 79%. Agriculture has such a great relationship with the Chinese people, so its production should be enough to be self-sufficient. However, since the opening of the closed-door policy, imperialists have used their imported goods to dump them in China, and the lives of farmers have improved as a result. In addition, the disturbances of banditry have turned fertile land into wasteland. What was once enough to be self-sufficient is no longer available! Even in terms of agricultural products, according to the report of the Bank of China in the twenty-first year (1932), the total value of imports in recent years has reached 560,000,000 yuan. In this adverse situation, the only way to save the situation is to prosper the countryside."</p>
<p>However, from my point of view, the two policies should be carried out in parallel. Rescuing the countryside is the most urgent task at present, and revitalizing industry should not be ignored. Otherwise, after the countryside prospers, the purchasing power of the people will increase. If there is nothing to supply their consumption at that time, they will eventually have to rely on foreign goods, repeating the same mistakes. The government's active suppression of bandits is a strategy to stabilize the countryside, and last year the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also proposed a four-year plan, which has been gradually implemented. Therefore, I say that "the revival of China's economy has a ray of dawn!"</p>
<h3>The Origins of China's Economic Destruction and Its Relief (Chen Senfu)</h3>
<p>If a family's economy is wealthy, then life is stable and they can enjoy their work. If a country's economy is sufficient, then all industries will flourish and the country will enjoy its benefits. For decades, our country has been invaded by imperialism from the outside and exploited by exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies from the inside. The national economy and people's livelihood have been greatly damaged. In recent years, due to the decline in the prices of agricultural products, the rural economy has become even worse. There are many ways to seek revival. Whether it is possible to alleviate the farmers' difficulties by using agricultural products to revive the countryside is worth studying. Let's discuss the origins of our country's economic destruction and then its remedies.</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural country. The clothing and food of farmers have always been self-spun and self-woven, self-cultivated and self-sufficient. In addition to paying taxes and grain, they sell the surplus in the market and exchange it for currency, and then use the currency to exchange for other consumer goods. In the past, the old system stipulated that the government would extract a certain amount of grain from the taxes collected and store it in warehouses (called "accumulated grain") to provide relief to the people in lean years. Otherwise, in years of famine, if there is no harvest of wheat and millet, where will the economic relief come from? The system of accumulating grain is indeed a good economic method for relieving farmers. This was the economic flow process of our country's old society. Although the organization cannot be called perfect, there was no risk of leakage. With the relaxation of the sea ban and the opening of the doors, the invasion of imperialism gradually deepened. The most harmful thing to our China was opium, which not only sucked away our money but also poisoned our nation. To this day, the poisonous atmosphere still permeates the country. Furthermore, relying on the development of its machine industry, it used our country as the final destination for dumping its surplus production, of which the import of cotton textiles was the largest, followed by food such as tobacco, sugar, and seafood, as well as firearms and ammunition for internal warfare. Moreover, because the country's people's material enjoyment is biased towards "foreign" goods, the import of luxury goods is also considerable, followed by various industrial supplies. In recent years, the most alarming thing has been rice, cotton, and wheat among agricultural products, which almost occupy the first place among imported goods. In summary, it is difficult to estimate the exact figures of the money that has flowed out of our country over the years. However, because our country's resources have been invaded and taken away by imperialism, how can the country not be poor and the people not be impoverished? This is the first reason for the exhaustion of the economy. The Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu (1894-1895) and the Boxer Rebellion (1900) were both alliances under the city, and they used the cession of land and indemnity to quell the matter. Thereupon, the domestic economy began to be precarious. Furthermore, from the founding of the Republic to the present, the twenty-second year (1933), there has been no year without internal warfare. The loss of firearms, ammunition, grain, and salaries consumed by all wars, as well as the wealth and property lost by the people in the war zones, when summarized, should also not be calculated. This is the second reason for the exhaustion of the economy. The integrity of politics has a great relationship with the prosperity of the national economy. Today, the situation of division has not ended, and the violent levies and exorbitant taxes are insatiable. The red atmosphere is still rampant, and banditry is endless. In addition, the water and drought disasters of recent years have come one after another. All of these affect the domestic economy and are the third reason for its exhaustion.</p>
<p>From the above three points, we can see that our country's economic exhaustion has lasted for decades. However, why do we only feel the decline and panic collapse today? The reason is that in the past, the government borrowed foreign debts, and overseas Chinese remitted large amounts of money back to the country, so it was able to adjust the financial surplus and deficit. Moreover, the surplus of customs revenue was not as large as in recent years, because our country shipped out raw silk, soybeans, tung oil, tea leaves, and the overseas Chinese</p>
<p>took over various manufactured industrial products domestically, so the total value of annual exports was also quite large, not as sluggish as in recent years. Since the relocation of the capital to the south, foreign debts have not been raised, and overseas Chinese remittances have not dared to be remitted due to lack of protection, or they have not been remitted due to business failures. In addition, with the abuse of foreign tribes, there is no time to take care of their families, let alone remit money back to the country. These two points alone are enough to make the economically exhausted country stretched to the limit. What's more, in recent years, our country's export products have been sluggish, robbed, reduced, and cut off. Now, let's analyze the general situation and explain it in detail.</p>
<p>Raw silk, which has always been the number one export commodity of our country, has been in decline for a long time due to the failure to study sericulture scientifically and blindly adhering to old chapters. Since the silk from Japan and Italy competed in the world market, the sales of Chinese silk have been declining. A check from the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925) showed that more than 155,000 piculs were shipped out, with a value of more than 129 million taels. Since then, it has decreased year by year, and the price has also fallen step by step. By last year, it was almost in a desperate situation. Although there has been a slight improvement now, with the Japanese silk ahead of us, there is no great hope. The second largest export product should be soybeans. The large output of soybeans is in the northeastern provinces, accounting for about 67% of the country's total output. In the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), the total value of soybean products (including soybean oil, soybean cake, and soybean meal) was more than 342 million taels, which actually surpassed raw silk. Today, the things are the same, but the people are different. This huge source of wealth has fallen into the pockets of the violent Japanese. If the lost land is not recovered, the rights and interests will never belong to us. How harmful is this to our country's economy? In modern times, the construction industry is becoming more and more sophisticated, so the use of paint is also increasing. The main raw material of paint is tung oil. Tung oil is a specialty of our country, and its production areas are mainly in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. In the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), the export value was also more than 32.5 million taels. The market in the United States accounts for about 80% of the total value. Recently, due to the failure to improve the refining methods, coupled with unscrupulous merchants disregarding international trade credit and mixing adulterated materials, and because the local area is not peaceful, transportation is sometimes hindered, and delivery cannot be made on time, causing Americans to be extremely dissatisfied. Therefore, they have already tried planting it domestically. No matter what the results will be in the future, the export volume of our country will be greatly affected. China was the country with the most prosperous tea production decades ago; the world's tea was supplied by us, and its total export value was comparable to that of raw silk. Since the rise of tea from India, Ceylon, Java, and Dongying Niaoguo (Japan) one after another, competing in the market, our country's tea industry has fallen miserably to the point of not being able to recover. Recently, it has become even more declining, not as good as the total value of eggs. In the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), the total value of eggs, such as fresh eggs, dried eggs, egg powder, egg whites, and preserved eggs and salted eggs, was more than 52.2 million taels. Eggs are a trivial matter, but their exports are so huge. However, recently, the inland egg price is lower than before, and the exports may have decreased slightly compared to before. The export value of tea leaves, which used to be famous, was only more than 22.5 million taels in the same year, compared with the export value of more than 110 million taels in the most prosperous years, which is almost equal to zero. Looking back on the past, it is regrettable! All the manufactured industrial products taken over by overseas Chinese are due to the dumping of Japanese goods at low prices in overseas ports, and the exclusion of our overseas Chinese by various countries. Our government does not make strong protests, nor does it try to protect them, and their own residency issues are still complicated. How can they care about taking over domestic goods? Looking at the various export goods mentioned above, except for soybeans, which have fallen into the hands of the Japanese pirates and are flourishing, the rest are declining, while imported goods are coming like a landslide. As a result, our country's money is going away with the huge waves. In this situation, how can the country's financial resources not be depleted and the farmers' economy not be impoverished? This is the origin of the collapse of the countryside and the decline of commerce.</p>
<p>I have mentioned above that our country is an agricultural country, and farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population. Although the times are slightly different, our country's industry is still in its infancy. How can we talk about industry? Therefore, we should still take agriculture as the foundation. If the farmers' economy is prosperous, their purchasing power will be strong. If the farmers' purchasing power is strong, the commerce will be developed. If the commerce is developed, the domestic economy will be stable, and the country can gradually be among the rich and powerful. However, to revive the countryside, we must first put politics on the right track and make the government clean. Otherwise, if one province is planning to revive agricultural products, another province will order them to be eradicated and forced to grow tobacco seedlings. A third province will still forcibly collect land taxes from these farmers, who are on the verge of death, to the point of two or three times, or even countless times, to the point that farmers sell their wives and children, but they are still not enough to cope with it, resulting in sticking the land deeds to the door and fleeing far away. With such contradictory phenomena, how can we revive the countryside? The purpose of reviving the countryside is to protect farmers and seek the prosperity of agricultural products. In addition, silk, tea, tung planting, chicken farming, and all other side businesses that farmers use for their annual consumption needs must be maintained and revitalized. However, today farmers are being squeezed by capitalism, exploited by usury, and since money has been concentrated in cities, they are suffering from economic distress and depletion of resources, resulting in fields without the strength to cultivate, mulberry trees being abandoned, and tea being allowed to age. Everything else is also abandoned. Now, if we want to save this extremely declining countryside and the dying farmers, we must have a comprehensive plan from the central government, a determination to implement it, and seek practical things without seeking to improve the situation. In short, the first priority is to set up low-interest loan offices and cooperatives in each town and village, or to organize collective farms like the Soviet Union, and use scientific methods to improve farming techniques. As for the cotton that is most needed now, we should find ways to improve the seeds. Building water conservancy projects, dredging rivers, and planting trees are all essential measures for farming that can reduce water and drought disasters, and we should strive to promote them without taking perfunctory actions. There are also other side businesses that need to be improved, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sericulture: We must establish scientific sericulture guidance centers or organize collective sericulture farms to improve products and compete with foreign silk.</p>
<p>(2) Tea Planting: Actively cultivate tea trees, reform cultivation, fertilization, and pruning methods to promote the propagation of branches and improve the quality of products.</p>
<p>(3) Tung Planting: Tung oil is the main raw material of paint and ranks fifth or sixth among export goods, so we should pay attention to cultivation. Moreover, tung trees are easy and fast to cultivate. All barren and humid areas, loose soil, deep valleys, and mountains can be planted. Moreover, areas that are not suitable for crops can be planted with tung trees. Once they grow and become shaded, the fallen leaves dissolve in the soil, and the soil quality becomes fertile, so the benefits of tung planting are very thin, and it can turn barren land into fertile areas, which is very beneficial to agricultural production.</p>
<p>(4) Chicken Farming: Currently, eggs are also an important export commodity, so chicken farming is also an important side business for farmers. Moreover, the food for chickens is nothing more than the remaining grains and sundries from the farm, so chicken farming is also a profitable side business for farmers. If there is a collective farm, chicken coops can be set up extensively.</p>
<p>The four items listed above are the most important, and they are also the goods that have always been famous in international trade. In addition, there are countless others. However, these several items also require major merchants who operate overseas trade to make every effort to rectify them.</p>
<p>First, we must eliminate the heart of greed and avoid mixing impurities, so as to revive the brand. Second, for manufacturing and baking, we should use scientific methods for supervision and control, and we should unite to seek to restore the previous position and reputation. All of these are directly beneficial to the rural economy and indirectly beneficial to the country's financial resources.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about industry again. The only industries in our country that are slightly embryonic are silk, flour, and yarn. Today, the silk factory is almost in a state of collapse, the flour industry is also declining, and the relatively large-scale textile industry is also in a precarious situation. The reason is that one is affected by the dumping of foreign goods, and the other is affected by the decline of the countryside. In this critical and existential textile industry, they have repeatedly jointly requested the Qing government to reduce the integrated tax and the import tax on mechanical supplies, but it has not been approved. Then, the government suddenly borrowed 50 million gold yuan from the United States with good intentions, using four-fifths to buy American cotton and one-fifth to buy wheat, to rescue the yarn industry. Since this news spread throughout the country, speculators took the opportunity to create an atmosphere, and Japanese merchants took the opportunity to manipulate the cotton market, buying up Chinese cotton. Unscrupulous merchants disregarded their shame, acted as accomplices, and only cared about profit, causing the yarn market to be in chaos, and customers waited and watched, resulting in a sharp drop in the price of yarn and cloth. Alas, the government's so-called rescue of the yarn industry has not seen any benefits, but has suffered harm first. The price of wheat has also fallen, and if a large number of goods are imported in the future, they will inevitably have to be unloaded, and the farmers on the verge of collapse will never be able to solve this hanging crisis. In the United States, exporting such a large number of surplus goods will allow the price of cotton in that country to continue to rise, while the cotton that our country purchases will inevitably exceed the normal market price due to the need to increase interest, freight, tariffs, and commissions. Can the textile industry, which is on the verge of extinction, afford these expensive raw materials, with each piece being dismantled for 60 to 70 yuan? Although manufacturers want to take care of the environmental relationship, they are afraid that they will not be able to withstand such losses. If the government sympathizes with the difficulties of the factories and sells at a discounted price, then the government will not only reduce huge amounts of money, but also be at a time when the United States is abandoning the gold standard and seeking currency competition. If three years later, when our country repays the loan, it happens to be the time to restore the gold standard, the losses will be even more significant. Although the repayment of the loan belongs to the government, the losses will still be borne by the people. Therefore, the use of the cotton and wheat loan can be used to revive the countryside and revitalize the basic industry, and there is still a glimmer of hope. To revitalize the basic industry, we should first rescue the large-scale textile industry, which is now on the verge of extinction. In addition to the political aspects of rescuing the textile industry, the problem is that the cotton fibers in the country are short and cannot be spun into fine yarn. Moreover, the national output is not enough to meet the consumption needs of the textile industry, so it must be sought from abroad, resulting in more than 3 million piculs of foreign cotton being imported annually, overflowing with more than 200 million yuan. Therefore, improving seeds and propagating cotton fields, so that the quality and quantity can meet the corresponding supply and demand, can fill the leak of 200 million yuan per year, which is the most urgent task. In terms of quality, we should expand the area where American cotton has been successfully planted in Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces as much as possible; in terms of quantity, such as Funing and Yancheng along the coast of Jiangsu, Kao Ganhuang County in Hubei, and Yuyao Sanmen Bay in Zhejiang, are all good places for cotton planting. As long as the government allocates a portion of the US loan to open up cotton farms in the above-mentioned areas, and since Henan and Shaanxi have suffered from water and drought disasters one after another, the rural areas have completely collapsed and the local areas are poor, if we engage in development there and renovate water conservancy projects, diverting the waters of Weinan and other rivers for irrigation, and at the same time rectify transportation and reduce transportation costs, then after several years, long-fiber cotton will be able to meet the needs of the domestic textile industry, so there is no need to seek it from abroad. In terms of quantity, it can also be self-sufficient, so the leak can be blocked, the farmers' economy can be prosperous, and the domestic economy can also be sufficient, which is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Changes in Soviet Agricultural Policy</h3>
<p>Last year, the Soviet Union deeply felt the difficulties in grain procurement, food shortages, farmers' hunger, and an agricultural crisis, which almost became unmanageable. This spring, the government vigorously sought ways to remedy the situation, focusing all its efforts on improving agriculture and increasing harvests. Since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union had primarily focused on industrial construction, but it shifted to increasing agricultural production. The total area of ​​sown agricultural crops in the Soviet Union is about 93.1 million hectares. Although there has been no improvement in individual agricultural crops this year, state-owned farms and collective farms have achieved great results (state-owned farms account for more than 10 million hectares of the total area, collective farms account for 68 million hectares, while individual agriculture accounts for only 11 million hectares), which has not been seen in recent years. The Soviet government's latest methods for promoting new agriculture are particularly noteworthy in that the Party departments are now directly involved in production guidance. Previously, the Party departments provided indirect guidance to collective farms. This spring, during the busy farming season, the government instructed local Party departments to personally go to the cultivated land to supervise and guide the farmers in the surrounding collective farms, and to actively assist the government's facilities with mechanical power. It also ordered 10,000 outstanding Party members to be assigned 2,500 of the latest tractors to the farms, granting them the power to take on the responsibility of production guidance. On the other hand, skilled drivers from major cities were selected and sent to the countryside to drive the cultivation. As a result, the internal organization of the collective farms, which account for seven-tenths of the Soviet agricultural households, and the strictness of labor discipline have achieved unexpected results in one fell swoop. In the past, the government collected the surplus harvests of collective farms, except for the necessary portion, at prices lower than the market price (about one-twentieth). Therefore, farmers were unwilling to work hard, even if they had abundant harvests. Now the government has changed this system, designating one hectare of sown area in each locality as the government's share, and the rest is freely disposed of by the collective farms. As a result, the farmers are happy to cultivate and strive to increase harvests. However, the production volume of one hectare stipulated by the government is absolutely not allowed to be neglected according to the law. In addition, the government's supervision during the farming period is unusually strict, and the prosecutor's office is dispatched to conduct on-site inspections regarding the government's due portion, and payment is made according to the quota, so that neither collective farmers nor individual farmers dare to violate the regulations in the slightest. When the manager of the grain trust of the Ukrainian state-owned farm was found to have concealed the amount of harvest, Stalin immediately ordered the local Party department to investigate. As a result, four concealers were sentenced to more than ten years of surveillance and exiled to the north. Since then, no farm in the country has dared to violate the ban again, and both the government and the farmers have achieved better-than-expected results.</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Slightly Up One or Two Jiao to Four or Five Jiao Gold Shorts and Longs Fall Back Two to Four Jiao Last week, from August 14th to 19th, the Hua Shang Securities Exchange was extremely dull, the most stagnant situation in two months. The trading was so light that there was no comparison. The reason was said to be that there was no change in the environment, and the account balance was already large, so the supply and demand of chips should be busy. It was said that the weather was hot, and there were only two trading sessions, so large households did not move forward, which also seemed to be true and false. In fact, since the Ministry of Finance sold a large amount of Issue 46 in the previous week, although it was for the purpose of regulating finance, there were also rumors of issuing new public bonds at the same time. The market sentiment suddenly became bleak, and both long and short sides were suspicious. If the long side had no hidden strength, it would never come out of the cage. If the short side was speculative, it would have no hedge. Mutual observation led to a stagnant and rotating situation. The more stagnant the market price, the lighter the trading, and large households had nowhere to start. Therefore, last week's trading was extremely light, and the market price was completely stagnant and rotating, with no meaningful rise or fall. The middle Wednesday and Saturday were relatively higher, and the rest were relatively smaller. Friday was especially stagnant and quiet. The daily rise and fall of market prices was no more than half a yuan for the most, and only one or two jiao for the least. Most of the transactions belonged to swap, and very few new trades were concluded. Large households rarely entered or exited. Therefore, the result of the week's market price was estimated to be only a slight increase of one or two jiao to four or five jiao. Among them, gold shorts and longs fell back two to four jiao, and the trend was chaotic. Starting this week, three trading sessions will be changed, and as the delivery date approaches, it should gradually become lively. The total turnover was only 30,096,000 yuan, more than half less than the previous week. The domestic sales counted 26,000 yuan, and futures, unified salt tax accounted for 11,655,000 yuan, demobilization accounted for 3,530,000, 19 customs accounted for 3,310,000, 20 volume and 20 customs accounted for 4,900,500, and the rest ranged from 100,000 to 570,000. Starting today, there will be one futures trading session in the morning and two sessions in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>What to Do?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zi</p>
<p>This is a very natural and easy phrase for Chinese people to utter when they cannot cope with something or have no solution. Therefore, this phrase contains quite a bit of weakness, decadence, and sadness. Of course, those who like to say this phrase are probably "suffering" from "fate."</p>
<p>I remember that at the end of last month, our Peace General Zhang, the young marshal who should permanently receive the Nobel Peace Prize, was talking to a French reporter in Paris. The reporter asked the young marshal for his opinion on the Manchurian Incident and the possible impact of this incident. Our young marshal then simply replied with "I don't know when this debt can be settled." Although this short sentence seems to be the young marshal's casual and generous speculation from the perspective and tone of an irresponsible observer, it is also truly filled with the weak and decadent sigh of "What to do?!" Yes, our young marshal is a Peace General, and his characteristic is precisely because he is also a suffering Chinese!</p>
<p>Although "What to do?" is weak, decadent, and sad, what other way is there for the suffering people besides saying this consciously or unconsciously? For example, the French declared that they occupied our nine small islands. Our loyal and kind administrator did not know about it. It was not until the Japanese came out and refused to share the spoils that our attention was forcibly drawn a little. They said that we were already "studying" and would raise a "protest," and it was a very serious one! But the fact is this: the French tricolor flag has been flying high on those nine small islands that no one noticed and are said to have only some bird droppings. Their warships are also moored there, and wisps of thick smoke are proudly spewing out of those tall gray cylindrical things. The sailors are jubilantly singing victory love songs: The Japanese are also very active and have not given up their demands and ambitions to share the spoils! But what about us, the suffering people? Besides watching the excitement objectively, we just finish by sighing "What to do?" Because what can we do?</p>
<p>Not long ago, due to the rise of the Yangtze River, Wuhan almost became like it was the year before. At that time, the country was indeed in an uproar, and many people were anxiously shouting "What to do?!" Later, thanks to the blessing of the Bodhisattva, the heavens opened their eyes, and the danger was averted, driving back the water ghosts. But the unfortunate fact is that recently the newspapers are clamoring and shouting about the Yellow River's water势即将夺运入准. Our Shandong Chairman is so anxious that he looks like he wants to say "What to do?" He grabs his beard and hair and sends a ten-thousand urgent telegram to the central government. The first sentence is to ask for "emergency relief." The central government is the most concerned about the people's suffering and must be very "worried" after hearing it! I am worried because I have relatives there, and the bones of my ancestors are all there, but there is no divine power of Buddha Bodhisattva to drive back the "water ghosts." Usually, there is no money to repair dikes and dams. In fact, absolutely no one would think of repairing them (because everyone is very busy!). Now, I can only anxiously shout "What to do!" "What to do!"</p>
<p>There are so many things we should shout "What to do?" about now that even breaking the steel pen nib would not be enough to write them all, and I am not happy to write them anymore. But I have gained an inspiration:</p>
<p>People, always falling into a deep sleep without moving, are inevitably covered with a thick quilt of helpless, weak, decadent, and sad "What to do?"!</p>
<h3>The Tea Shop in Town A</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>In Town A, a small area of only half a mile, commerce is not developed, but there are more than 40 tea shops, accounting for one-third of all the shops in the town, which can be regarded as a special phenomenon of Town A. It seems that the people of Town A have inherited the legacy of Lu Yu and Lu Tong's love of tea, so tea shops are so developed. However, this is not the case. In fact, fewer than ten people visit a tea shop specifically to taste tea and quench their thirst. Their only business is not here but there, relying on the benefits of "gambling" to make money. The words "selling tea" are just a cover for the "gambling den."</p>
<p>These more than 40 "secretly public" gambling dens vary in size. The types of gambling include digging flowers, matching patterns, Pai Gow, shaking dice, poker. Every shop has them. The size of the winnings and losses depends on the luxurious or simple decoration of the establishment. With exquisite furnishings, several "rich people" can be invited to come. Without money, the decoration is simpler, and only the proletariat of the general farming and working class can patronize, and don't expect to win the participation of the rich. Roughly speaking, each of the upper two establishments has an intake of several thousand yuan per day, and the lower ones are not fixed, ranging from a few yuan to a few strings of cash. The names of these "fake tea shops" are novel and unique! How so? "XX Villa" "XX News Agency"</p>
<p>"XX Cottage" "Leisurely Gatherings" "People's Social Club," bizarre and varied, nothing is impossible. When outsiders arrive, they are confused by the tea shops. The people of Town A are really gamblers. More than 40 gambling dens are not enough to meet their needs. Last month, another one called "Sanmin Company" was established, with magnificent decorations and grand designs, setting a new record for gambling dens in Town A, being second to none. It can be said to live up to the name "Sanmin." After the opening, wealthy men, wealthy women, young masters, and young ladies, dressed in formal attire, flocked in droves. Suddenly, it broke the silent air of Town A.</p>
<p>I am a poor and liver-sickly literary beggar, naturally unqualified to step into this "gilded den." But I heard that the gambling company was named "Sanmin," and I was a little surprised in my heart. Could it be that these old masters, young masters, and young ladies, while "calling and drinking," are busy stealing leisure, practicing entertainment without forgetting the revolution, and studying "The Three Principles of the People?" That would be admirable, worth a visit.</p>
<p>Stepping into the door is like stepping onto the front line. The scene is filled with smoke. It's terrible! The smoke flew and penetrated my nostrils, and my intuition told me that it contained the ingredients of both opium and cigarettes, so the nature was unusually strong. Turning to the forehead, I became dizzy and almost fell down. Five hundred gasoline lamps shone as bright as day. I saw heads moving everywhere and people clamoring. "White Tiger, White Tiger" followed a burst of silver ocean sounds. At the same time, there came two different sounds of joy and sorrow, "Hahaha" and "Aiya Aiya Aiya." Stealing a glance at the table, I couldn't help but exclaim. Green and colorful banknotes were stacked more than a foot high. Could they be unusable underworld banknotes? Otherwise, how could there be so many?</p>
<p>The air was smoky and miasmic, waiting for a headache. So I retreated and walked past the door of the resting room. Suddenly I heard a delicate voice singing Peking opera, "One horse leaves the Western Liang Realm." I suddenly realized that "Sanmin" originally meant "smoke, gambling, prostitution."</p>

<h3>A Scene of Giving Out Watermelons</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The servant A-Xiang in the X residence next door saw his master buy three loads of watermelons in the morning. He thought, "Wonderful! Isn't it the Great Heat solar term today? It's the rule of the master here that every year after the Great Heat, the servants get watermelons to eat."</p>
<p>He had been longing for the taste of watermelons for a long time without money to buy any, and it seemed that he would have the hope of "tasting" it in a short while. "Dang, dang, dang," the clock struck three times, but the master still hadn't given out the watermelons. A-Xiang was wiping the oil lamp with his hands, and his neck was already stretched long, looking inside, hoping to see someone bringing the watermelons out. Finally! The old nanny came out, holding a plate of cut watermelons in her hands, and put it on the table, shouting, "A-Xiang, A-Mao, Gen-Sheng, the watermelon is here, nine pieces for you three." A-Xiang had been waiting anxiously for a long time, his mouth watering. Seeing the old nanny bring the watermelons, how could he not be happy? Without waiting for "A-Mao the cook" and "Gen-Sheng the messenger" to move, he impolitely dropped the work in his hands and rushed to the table, reaching out with his pair of pitch-black hands stained with kerosene, aiming at the three largest pieces of watermelon on the plate, grabbing them and shoving them into his mouth. In a short while, he had eaten the three pieces like a whirlwind. But he was still staring at the six pieces of watermelon on the plate for A-Mao and Gen-Sheng, guessing that he must be thinking, "If I could eat these six pieces of watermelon by myself, that would be wonderful!" But in fact, the master had assigned three pieces to each person, and he couldn't lose face and grab them to eat, so he could only stare at the watermelons blankly without moving. A-Mao and Gen-Sheng, seeing his greedy appearance, couldn't help but find it "funny." He felt a little embarrassed, turned around, and continued to do the work he hadn't finished. A-Mao and Gen-Sheng were laughing at him, but he pretended not to see it. At this moment, the old nanny came out again with a plate of watermelons, passing by him. He glanced at it and saw more than ten pieces of snow-white watermelon on the plate. He quickly asked the old nanny, "Zhang Ma, who is this watermelon for?" "For the teacher!" He heard that it was for the teacher, and thought to himself that the teachers have small appetites and can't eat so many watermelons, but they get so much. We have big appetites and can eat it all, but we only get three pieces. Moreover, it's obvious that the watermelon for the teacher is several times better than what we get!</p>
<p>Promote Domestic Woolen Cloth and Silk — Xiao Cao While he was pondering, the old nanny slowly walked out again with half a large, uncut red watermelon. A-Xiang thought that this was for Zhang Ma herself, and she was getting a lot! He might as well go up and get some. So he pretended to chat and asked, "Mama! Who is this for?" "This... this is for the coachman A-Lan." A-Xiang was stunned, and thought to himself that this was strange! He immediately rushed to ask A-Mao, who had entered this X family earlier than him, "Brother Mao, don't you think our master is very unfair? We are all human beings, why are the watermelons for the teacher better and more plentiful than ours?" "Brother A-Xiang, you are really a fool, speaking without thinking. The teacher is a superior person, and should have special treatment with good food and more servings! How can we inferior people compare to him? Do you want the master to treat us all the same? This is exactly 'cows eat rice straw, ducks eat grain,' each person has their own fortune." "Brother A-Mao, I'm afraid you're wrong! Since we and the teacher have different levels and can't compare, then just now Zhang Ma took out half of a very good red watermelon and said it was for A-Lan. You think he is a coachman and an inferior person like us, how can he have the same treatment as the teacher, exceeding us several times? Is he also a superior person as a coachman?" A-Mao listened to A-Xiang's words, first looked around, and saw that there was no one there. Then he whispered in A-Xiang's ear, "Alas! You ask too much. Originally, A-Lan was also an inferior person and had the same treatment as us, but last year he had 'peach blossom luck' and was favored by the Fifth Mistress of the master's family! So after that, he became popular, and his various treatments are really different from ours! This is also this little devil's good luck!" A-Xiang understood in his heart and nodded, saying "Oh! So that's how it is."</p>

<h3>Innocence</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>How ugly Sister A-Bao was! Her face was dark, flat, and round, and decorated with a few flaws. She was short and fat, and when she walked, she looked like a section of winter melon moving on the ground. Everyone who saw her said that Sister A-Bao was ugly! And Sister A-Bao herself felt that she was too ugly when she looked in the mirror. Although her mother still loved her, compared to her younger sister, Sister A-Chuan, she was far behind. So her younger sister often bullied her. When she couldn't do anything about it, she only blamed her bitter fate, and why God had given her such a figure! However, the most embarrassing thing was Sister A-Bao's marriage problem. She was a well-known ugly woman in the town, and her age was increasing year by year. She was already in her twenties. Sister A-Chuan was already married, and her mother had grandchildren. But no one had come to propose marriage for Sister A-Bao. Of course, the mother knew that a man should marry when he grows up, and a woman should marry when she grows up. When she was anxious, she also shamelessly asked people to pay attention, but people only responded with a smile.</p>
<p>In a well-off family in a nearby town, a couple and a three-year-old child lived together. The man worked outside, and the woman was weak and unable to do housework, so they wanted to hire an honest and reliable servant to take care of the child. So they found Sister A-Bao. At first, the master also disliked her ugly appearance, but in the end, she stayed to take care of the child because of her loyalty and diligence. The child always smiled at Sister A-Bao. After a few days, he couldn't leave Sister A-Bao for a moment. Even when the child's parents liked to hold him and play with him, he would cry and run to Sister A-Bao. As soon as he was in Sister A-Bao's arms, he would smile happily again. In the child's mind, he only knew that Sister A-Bao treated him well, holding him and leading him to play every day, comforting him when he cried, and stroking him to sleep at night. He didn't know that Sister A-Bao was ugly, and often kissed her ugly face with his two small hands. Since Sister A-Bao was comforted by this innocent child, her sadness was slightly reduced. A strong hope filled her, hoping that this child would always comfort her. Sometimes she would ask this innocent child, "Bao Bao, will you remember Sister A-Bao when you become an official in the future?" The child smiled and didn't speak. When urged, he leaned on Sister A-Bao's shoulder and whispered in her ear, "I won't forget. When Bao Bao becomes an official, I will buy things for you to eat." Sister A-Bao listened, with a slight bitter smile on her face.</p>
<p>The child grew up day by day. Sister A-Bao was in her thirties and was still working in the master's house, but the child went to school in a distant town, and only came home twice a year during winter and summer vacations. How lonely Sister A-Bao was, thinking of this child she had raised! Every time he came home, she always loved him with all her heart, but the child was indifferent and unwilling to be as close to Sister A-Bao as he used to be. Sister A-Bao often cried secretly when she thought about it.</p>
<p>Sister A-Bao's age gradually became blurred. The child was already working in society and had a position and reputation. When he came home, Sister A-Bao always asked him if he was cold or hungry, but in the heart of the grown-up child, she felt that she was ugly and annoying, and even spoke harshly to her. At this time, Sister A-Bao's heart was broken. She knew that her child had lost his innocence. She cursed why time passed so quickly, not only increasing the child's age, but also taking away the child's innocence?</p>

<h3>War and Peace (5)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: Of course, so many palace maids and concubines serve him, he is still not happy, who wants you country man to empty his chamber pot? It's really a joke.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man C: Why haven't they come yet? I guess they can't be relied on today.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: What did you say hasn't come? Middle-aged man C: Isn't it for those two animals. Middle-aged man B: Do you really think they will come back? Stop dreaming. Even if they are not killed by stray bullets, they will be stewed and eaten by those soldiers. You still want them to return it to you?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man A: Be more generous, I advise you. So many lives can't be taken care of, who cares about your mules? Let me tell you another thing. Wang Xiucai of Taishi Village is considered a remarkable gentleman. But once, a regiment commander wanted him to send two pigs and six hundred steamed buns within four o'clock. Wang Xiucai couldn't get them for a while. Two pigs, how easy is that? Where do you want him to find them? Later, the regiment commander sent four guards with box cannons to arrest him. He scolded him severely and said he would execute him. In the end, he paid four hundred yuan and was released. But this is not considered strange. Anyway, for rich people like Wang Xiucai, it doesn't matter if they take out more money. There is also a farmer from the Zhang family. A mule was sold for forty yuan, and when he heard that the soldiers were coming, he hid the money in the wall overnight. When it was almost dark, there was indeed a gun butt knocking on the door, so he hurriedly hid his daughter's silver hairpin and a few silver coins in the wall. Later, the door was opened, and a group of soldiers came to station. One of them hung a gun on the wall, and the gun barrel hit the wall, and he happened to hear the sound of silver coins inside, so at night he pried open the partition and took it all away. Poor old man was so angry that he died. You probably won't believe it when I say it.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: Damn it, there is only one way to deal with these things, that is to hide the grain, anyway, people are going to escape, and even burn the fodder without hesitation, so they can't rob it or buy it, that's the most satisfying thing.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man C: I don't think it's necessary, why? Because they are fighting foreigners after all.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: What if they are fighting the Japanese? Does fighting the Japanese mean they can do anything?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man A: That's right, I already think so, does fighting foreigners mean they can be lawless?</p>
<p>Old woman: Isn't it? Since ancient times, good iron is not used to make nails, and good people don't become soldiers. All soldiers are the same.</p>
