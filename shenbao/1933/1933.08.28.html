<h3>集全力治黄</h3>
<p>明</p>
<p>今年黄水氾濫到處横流爲近五十年來所僅有下游之山東曹州東阿一帶早已横决人民損失甚鉅而江蘇北部亦被波及現雖未成巨災但水勢所趨恐亦難以倖免河南境内被災亦甚重大鄭州以上較易擺脫水患之區亦不能免山西原居上游宣洩甚易似宜不致成災然而晋省西路汾河流域各地亦遭大水致增黄河横流下游水患因之更甚吾人觀察洪水成災之原因在鄭州以下一爲黄水混濁水流遲緩漸致河身淤塞岸不固河口形成冲積地高過河床而河流經過之地如豫如魯遂時有變爲澤國之虞再則黄河兩岸自綏遠至於入海之濱兩岸皆屬黄泥層土一受急流洗刷即有崩潰可能三則沿黄河流域開闢日久人口稠密生活不易一般人民祇圖一時苟安絕少久遠之計因之黄河兩岸之森林無人注意培植而原有森林又皆砍伐殆盡此三者皆爲黄河發生水患之原因也</p>
<p>此等原因歷來治黄者豈有不知然而自遜淸以迄今日類皆致力於切堵之工作一朝洪水來臨舉國上下急急堵塞及至秋去冬來水患稍平則又立見鬆弛不再顧問馴致我國北部文明日趨衰落假令長此遷延不亟圖根本修治竊恐華北黄河流域自龍門以下均不免有化作沙漠之慮吾人回顧黄河史蹟每二三十年必發生水患一次間五六十年每有一次汎濫而每次大汎濫中人民之損失如河南河北山東及江蘇北部等至少當在數億以上由此可知根本修治黄河之必要矣</p>
<p>至根本治河方法第一在疏濬使水流就一定水道不致淤塞第二在修築束水長堤使流水能迅速行動冲刷河底之沉澱第三開濬河口幷在河口修築海堤使黄水入海之處不致變爲淺灘河水出海不受阻礙此三項辦法工程浩大論時間非十年八年所能濟論金錢非五萬萬元以上不辦以今日中國國庫之窮人民之困何來如此巨欵作此雄大之遠圖然而欲永遠免除河患非决心發此宏願不可今者首都將召集六省防汛會議可見中央已甚注重於此惟吾人尤望政府能提綱挈領通籌全盤計劃統一各種治水之機關不宜枝枝節節任各省各謀其利某會主張某種計劃某省主張先治某河或治運或導淮非不言之成理娓娓動聽然而主張不定各爲一省利害計即不能舉全國之力以治理之結果徒滋議論之糾紛而於實際一無所成故吾謂今日欲根本上治理河患非統籌全局不可也</p>
<p>若謂今日無鉅大財力以作此根本久遠之圖不得已而爲其次治標計亦不能僅恃堵塞工作專致力於臨時救濟蓋堵塞之功效不過能維持二三年而已故即言治標亦應作二三十年計劃沿河種樹培植森林一以穩固堤基使泥沙少隨流水一以吸收水分使雨水調節則黄河濁流可淸次爲修理溝渠蓋北方各地之溝渠廢弛已久夏季驟雨過量即將無處消納故溝渠之疏通亦甚重要旣可因勢利導以分黄水之流又能收灌溉之效而人力財力之消費亦較少（治標方法當不止此茲僅舉一例）今如不得已而言治標則此種辦法十年後亦可在見功效要視國人之致力何如而已</p>

<p>羅斯福將與英銀行總裁</p>
<h3>討論安定貨幣</h3>
<h3>戰債問題亦將談及</h3>
<h3>美復興計劃將成功</h3>
<p>紐約垣街著名金融領袖今日聲稱、聞羅斯福總統擬於下星期内在海德公園接見　倫銀行總裁諾曼、屆時對於安定金元與金鎊問題、將加以討論、而財政次長阿哲生紐約聨邦儲備銀行總裁哈禮森與預算局長陶格拉斯等亦將參加談話、據聞、所有關於安定英美貨幣之一切提議、連設立國際安定賚金團在内、悉將置於討論之列、至戰債雖將談及、但非主要議題、</p>
<p>貨幣政策試騐已近結束時期又聞美國貨幣政策之試騐、已近結束時期、美政府將從國外貿易及其與實業復興計劃關係之立塲、進而籌議安定匯價、據稱、巴塞爾國際銀行邇來除贊同歐陸中央銀行鞏固本身、靜侍美國試騐終了之計劃外、對於國際金融絕少措施、該銀行董事大多數深信美國之試騐、將於三個月内結束、但苟非英美對於安定匯兌問題有所行動、則該銀行仍將繼續觀望政策也、</p>
<p>據今夜所聞、美總統下星期接見英倫銀行總裁談論安定問題之又一理由、則因美金元在國際匯兌市場之價格、常爲外國投機者所操縱、以致漲落不定、妨碍美國之國外貿易、且美政府嘗期望眨落金元價格後、可令本國貨物易向或外市塲推銷、他國貨物更難在國内銷售、不料結果適得其反、六月份貿易進口實在增加、而出口却未能副其期望、蓋以匯價漲落不定、在許多方面、幾使出口商無從開價也、</p>
<p>實業復興計劃當局信可成功又據此間所接華盛頓消息、美總統深信實業復興計劃將可成功、而實業復興行政督辦强森亦信實業復興計劃已有充分進展、可無再行膨脹通貨之必要、華盛頓電訊所謂貨幣政策並無變動者、其意蓋謂當實業生產數量與貨物銷費數量俱有增加之際、母須再擾及金元而已、</p>
<p>今日美總統在范薩大學廣塲、向若干友人演說謂美國之經濟潮流、已切實轉變方向、今已開始入於向上階段、全國實業復興行政處之計劃、正在成功途徑、並對於各業之與政府合作、表示感謝、謂所遇若干反對、固在意料之中、且大半係屬眞心反對、並未雜有任何作用於其間、雖然、目下機器之使用者、已多於前、失業工人之重得工作者、亦日有增加、而商店之營業數額、亦已增多云云、觀此演說、足以徴實美總統對於實業復興計劃之成功、確已抱樂觀也、</p>
<p>惟銀行界亦承認金元之跌價、曾有利於保護美國市塲、抵抗其他貶落貨幣國家之競爭、且實曾抵銷美國孤立之不利影響、而使貿進出口相抵、餘額更接近於鍵全狀况、以故金元之貶價、是否尙有展時延期之必要、大約將爲海德公園討論之一事、</p>
<p>紐約世界最富之油業大王洛基斐勒現發出一文、勸全國各界人民聨合一致、促進國家實業復興案之成功、謂此案有以任何犧牲達其目的之價値云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>歐洲金本位國靜待金元恢復歐洲金本位國家之金融代表曾謂、國際銀行之工作、正</p>
<p>靜侯金元之恢復金本位、惟關於此層、美總統是否將與諾曼討論及之、則今夜尙未有表示云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統目前之目的、乃在恢復物價繁榮至一九二四年與一九二五年之程度、惟據美國報紙之意見、羅氏準備援用復興案中彼享有之權力、提高物價、並藉通貨膨脹或美元抑價、策勵商業之活動、復興程序與通貨膨脹、今雖在競進中、但據現狀觀之、羅斯福總統須俟用業規方法擴大購買力與增加工資並職業之舉失敗後、始用通貨膨脹爲應付大局之最後武器、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約美國内衣業、以時屆秋令、内衣之猶要正殷、决定加入其他實業、同享「藍鷹」運動之利益、今日已有代表全業百分之九十五之工廠、聨合擬成業規、送請政府核准、其中規定工資至少每週十三元、工時最多四十小時、並允改良工人衛生狀况、倘此業規爲美總統批准後、則政府宣傳員將勸人民購此種工廠之出品云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>美元英鎊跌落德國大起恐慌柏林此處自聞美金與金鎊重見低落、已發生嚴重恐慌、此項新變更、在德國市面上的影響、爲此後德國貨品的銷行於國外、將益見其困難、蓋在現狀之下、德國爲付給進口貨及償付外債等、而不得不覓取外幣、此事已日見其困難也、至於最後之結果、則仍對於幣制低落之國家爲不利、以幣制穩固之德國、或其他國家、將停止購買、而幣制低落之國家、亦將無從售賣也、現德國恢復國外貿易之企圖、顯已受一打擊、而政府方面之打破失業難關、當亦受有影響、惟經濟財政二界均表示希望、謂世界財政狀况不久將有改善之趨勢、而德國亦終必可自其多經濟危殆、及貿易停滞之局面中、重露頭角云、（二十六日國民社電</p>
<p>羅斯福</p>
<h3>發表兼善主義</h3>
<p>紐約羅斯福總統今日在著名女子專校法薩學院演講、揭示一種新原則、謂爲家庭計、爲社會計、個人與家庭皆不許作損害其鄰之事、羅總統在其演詞中言及國家實業復興程序之成功、謂已呈否極泰來之象、又謂不損害其鄰的觀念之擴大、必不可認個人自由之妨害、蓋諭人給發充分工資、與諭人勿僱用童工、或勿再惹厭、同爲一種限制也、以國家意識言、所謂鄰者即美國整個的人民、設北方人民無補於南方或西方之人民、則吾人不能對於北方人民予以特殊之考慮、吾人不能偏惠一業、而使他業受損、此種善鄰主義、亦宜適用於地方政府之難題中云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>日軍閥與封建勢力反對</p>
<h3>齋藤妥協政策</h3>
<p>東京齋藤内閣與政友會之妥協、遂引起軍閥及封建殘類之反對、如國策協定工作中、政友會爲難齋藤首相而虚過日子、則此妥協恐不能成功、因此妥協之性質、純爲財閥圖復其政權之初步工作、故軍閥及上院之封建勢力、爲自己利益打算、甚不满意、如軍閥之政治集團明倫會已表明反對無謂之妥協在前、上院公正會亦於昨已上午九時開會議决反對妥協、日本生產黨等之法西斯暴力團體、亦</p>
<p>藉營救五一五案同志爲名、在各地方加緊進行其打倒進黨、打倒財閥之工作、因有此種情勢、下星期中鈴木見齋藤時所表示之態度、足以爲預測日政局之前途如何了結、（二十七日華聨社電）</p>

<p>塔斯二十六日奥德賽電法前總理及急進黨領袖赫禮歐氏已於今晨九時十五分行抵奥德賽、赫氏此次蘇聨之行、爲其生平第二次、當地官方及外交委員會報界代表對此法國政治家之蒞止蘇境、咸與以熱烈之歡迎、赫氏在答覆外交委員會及奥德賽區執行委員會代表之招待時、對彼身受之友誼歡迎、深表謝忱、並請求將彼之謝意傳達认奥德賽城及其區内之工人、彼謂「余得重來蘇聨、至以爲幸、余固希望此行得促進和平、並有利於蘇法兩國者、敬祈將余此項願望轉告君等所代表之工人、」赫氏經一新聞片攝影技師之請求、在顯微聲筒前作一簡短之演說、彼重復申述其對於歡迎一謝忱、及其願此行得促進和平之厚望、彼稱、「余深信蘇聨人民之前途、萬分光明、並力方彼一向努力法·蘇兩國之親善、並願增進兩國之關係、赫氏在與當地契爾諾摩司卡耶孔墨那報記者之談話中、申稱彼願意了解蘇聨工業農業及文化之成就、彼謂、「誠如君等所知、余此行已爲第二遭、故余急欲知悉自余上次來此後、其進步已爲何如也、余希望能逗留蘇聨、直知九月十日離此、但結果能如此長期居此與否、現尙未定」云、</p>
<p>塔斯二十七日莫斯科電蘇聨政府公報「伊斯維斯太」報今日對於赫禮歐氏之訪問蘇聨載一社評、宣稱、蘇聨羣衆將熱烈歡迎此法國政治家之來訪、以赫氏之名、固爲蘇聨羣衆所熟知者、該報指稱赫氏在蘇法關係之歷史中、及法國外交政策之其他方面、曾起决定之作用、該報又稱、「即在一九二零年時、赫氏已理解十月革命爲有最大歷史意義之事件、在　一九二二年、彼曾來蘇聨、並力主法國與蘇維埃共和國之親善、二年以後、即在一九二四年、彼提出法國在外交上承認蘇聨之問題、且竟實現其主張、在一九三一年、彼在法蘇不侵犯公約之計劃中、表示最深切之注意、並努力促成此約之成立、」該報復謂、「赫氏此時第二次來到蘇聨、適値蘇聨全境社會主義建設有最大之發展、而資本主義世界有最深之危機之秋、國際資產階級過去所懸蘇聨必將退向資本主義舊道之希望、在現時情况中、已經消失、現時對於蘇維埃權力鞏固之不容爭辯之事實、舉世已加承認、同時所有資產階級中之著名智識分子、亦俱了解蘇聨和平政策之重要、内親切體會由資本主義世界之危機所召致之文化的衰落、及由法西主義慫恿之野蠻的狂流之分子、現將益形了解蘇聨在國際關係中、及其向戰爭威脅之爭鬥中、所處地位之積極前進矣、該報在結論中謂、「赫氏無疑的爲正確理解蘇聨之地位、爲一國際因子之目光遠大的資產階級政治家中之一人、當彼蒞臨蘇聨領土時、即表示其願促進和平之期望、蘇聨羣衆亦作與赫氏同樣之期望、並願力助赫氏鞏固法蘇兩國和平關係之努力」云、</p>

<h3>李烈鈞昨返滬</h3>
<p>薛篤弼黄少谷曾往晤</p>

<p>中委李烈鈞、前應蔣委員長電邀、赴廬山洽商察省善後、業於昨晨十時三十分、乘怡和公司公和輪返滬、在虹口碼頭登陸後、逕返馬斯南路私邸休息、下午三時半、薛篤弼·黄少谷·曾聨袂往晤、李氏昨對本報記者表示、擬先派代表赴魯謁馮、本人短期内暫不離滬、各情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>晤蔣經過</h3>
<p>李氏於月初赴廬山後、在廬山應蔣委員長約、先後其晤談四次、除商察事善後外、並面獻救國意見、又與汪院長孫院長、諸人會晤、商談一切重要問題、李氏此行、偕有秘書張宓公、曁　員男女公子等五人、於二十三日下山至九江、在九江小住兩日、二十五日由九江乘輪東下、昨晨十時三十分抵滬、</p>
<h3>蔣氏憂國</h3>
<p>本報記者、昨日下午、訪晤李氏於馬斯南路寓次縱談時事李氏蒿目時艱、多所感慨、謂在贛迭晤蔣委員長、蔣憂國心長、賢勞備至、余擬在滬休息一二日、草一長篇意見書致蔣、以爲謀國之借鏡、至馮煥章先生之名義誠如孫哲生氏所云、中央擬任以陸軍檢閱使或水利督辦、苟出自誠意、深信馮氏當可接受、余以私事留滬、短期内暫不他往、擬先派一代表赴魯謁馮也云云、</p>
<h3>書面談話</h3>
<p>李氏昨復發表書面談話如下察事和平商洽已成過去問題、然馮煥章之傳檄收復四縣與一戰攻克多倫、後之史者、當有紀載、而政府雖似以大兵壓迫張垣、亦未眞有其事、貽歷史羞也、余此次在山、對察事與馮先生之行動、固亦有談話、但余所注重者、仍在實現民治、修明因政、完備國防諸端、蔣汪諸先生頗爲同意、特雖有意行之、而尙未得其道耳、蔣先生精神頗好如初、對國事亦極憂慮、殊見賢勞、余昨在途中、見報載日本醉心侵略、銳意革新、我政府諸人、誠更當猛醒矣、余以家中有事、暫時不離申、馮先生處、當先派代表致景慕之忱云云、</p>
<p>馬占山將軍</p>
<h3>昨日由杭來滬</h3>
<p>黄郛等力勸馬氏就軍委職</p>
<p>馬表示待部屬安置後决定</p>
<p>抗日健將馬占山將軍、前以滬埠氣候炎熱、於上月二十三日、偕副司令張殿九等赴杭、轉往莫千山避暑、業已月餘、茲以財長宋子文定於明日由美返國、爰於昨日下午一時零十分、由杭乘汽車返滬、以資歡迎、據馬氏代表吳煥章語新新社記者稱、昨日偕同馬將軍來滬者、除馬氏外、計參謀姜松年及本人（吳氏）曁副官兩名、一行共五人、尙有張副司令（殿九）及周廳長（維泰）兩氏、定本日夜車由杭來滬、余等於今日上午七時三十分、由杭分乘汽車兩輛來滬、即日下午一時零十分抵埠、車行約六小時、馬將軍以本日路途顚簸、車行時間較久、精神稍感疲憊、故抵滬後、即返私邸休息、關於馬將軍力辭軍委職問題、此次自經平政委會黄委員長（膺白）及本人在山力勸後、馬氏已表示待部屬得有安置辦法、再行考慮决定、馬氏對李（杜）朱（子橋）兩將軍所發生捐欵事宜、據聞馬氏最近電李、表示絕對贊成淸查、惟主在淸查期内、應守緘默、以免熱血愛國同胞之灰心、待淸查結果、再詳細公佈報端以昭信譽云云、</p>
<h3>孔祥熙談話</h3>
<p>中央俟宋到後將召集會議</p>
<p>棉麥借欵决不用作軍政費</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁孔祥熙氏、赴贛謁蔣委員長、已於前日事畢返滬、昨午、孔氏在宅、接見往訪之新聲社記者、作下列之談話、</p>
<h3>此行頗圓满</h3>
<p>孔氏首答記者之問表示赴贛就商近來協助財政負責當局所辦理之財政等問題、頗爲圓满、在財長宋子文氏尙未回滬之前、仍暫由本人協肋財政負責當局辦理、按財次鄒琳·曾於昨午十一時半、往訪孔氏、談約半小時、係向宋氏報告財政問題</p>
<h3>不作軍政費</h3>
<p>關於五千萬美棉麥借欵之用途、外間頗爲注意、且頗多推測之處、孔氏對此事、聲明蔣委員長主張此欵應用於生產方面、决不用作軍政等各費、即行政院汪院長、亦同此主張、本人等對此欵之建議、亦主用於生產方面、俾借以恢復落後之中國生產事業、</p>
<h3>召開重要會</h3>
<p>關於中央預備於宋財長到後召集一重要會議、討論外財以及國内等各項問題、孔氏謂、此爲當然之舉、宋氏屆時將有相當之報告、將來開會地點、即在南京、幷不在廬山召集、不過宋到滬後、將赴廬山一行、俾向蔣氏報告此行之經過情形、</p>
<h3>技術合作事</h3>
<p>關於財宋近來在國聨所取得之技術合作問題、此爲三年前之事、蓋以前國聨曾派員來華調查、有衛生代表拉西曼·交通代表海斯·財政代表　特·經調查完畢回歐後、乃乘宋氏赴歐之便、就商將如何辦理、故此事幷非初成立、乃舊事重提、經調查後、將進行第二步工作也、至日本實無反無反對之理由與必要、</p>
<h3>銀協定問題</h3>
<p>至此次財宋在世界經濟會所簽定之九國銀協定、於我頗有益、該協定將於明年一月一日生效、各關係國無論如何、當在是日以前批准、通知美國、將來生效後、銀價一家可望提高、則白銀之向外出售、有一定之限制、而產銀之國、且設法予以收買、則銀價自有提高之可能矣、</p>
<h3>勦匪頗進步</h3>
<p>孔氏又談及勦匪問題、謂近來頗進步、自蔣氏在贛設立軍官訓練班、加以相當之訓練後、此項工作、尤著成效、至贛省主席熊式輝被剌說、實無其事、本人在廬未聞有是說、到滬始聞有此類謠言云、</p>
<h3>李石曾昨來滬</h3>
<p>國際圖書館書籍徴求已不少</p>

<p>於七月及九月間之國際文化協會之例會、亦不克如期參加、下次會議、將於本年底召開、故出國期、大約在本年未、繼談國際文化協會中國分會及中國國際圖書館籌備之近况、茲分錄如下、</p>
<p>國際文化會國際文化協會之總會、設於日内瓦、加入各國均設分會、以交換及研究各國之文化爲宗旨、現加入者已有三十餘國、我國近始加入已、成立籌備委員會、由吳稚暉先生任委員長、月前曾舉行籌備委員會於此間、商討徴求會員等事宜、現已開始進行、各國分會、其性質各有不同、或由政府組織、或由國民發起、而我國則以政府之指導及學術界之熱烈參加、以完成其使命、</p>
<p>國際圖書館中國國際圖書館、係仿德國之文化研究院而組織、蓋爲一國之社團、其副院長貝爾。曾組織文化調查團來華考察者、該圖書館旣爲一國際性質之團體、故其會員、將遍求各國學術界之聞人、並對漢學富有研究興趣之學者、會員額定三百人、年納會費四百元、圖書館設日内瓦、陳列我國出版之古今中外書籍、以供研究、並備留學海外之學生及專門家之參考、本人此次回國、全爲徴集圖書、因尙未能結束、故遲未赴歐、至已徴得會員、亦未有總數、</p>

<p>開會日期地點未定</p>
<p>大陸報云、反戰會議主席馬萊勛爵昨日（二十六）下午在旅館接見新聞記者時、對於外間所具此次反對戰爭聨合陣線大會出於第三國際發起主持之印象、力加否認、謂此會絕無共產色彩、各代表乃一堅固單位、决意推行一種主義、即反對戰爭是、至擇在上海開會者、因此間一隅最有戰爭危險之故、昨晨渠曾訪工部局總董裴爾與细裁費信惇、但僅屬普通訪問、尙未提出准許開會之請求　、此會原定自九月三日至五日間集議三日、現已無定期展延、因其日期及地點、俱非俟確知赴會人數後、不能决定、至赴會人數、少或二十人、多至二千人、亦未可知、馬氏又否認籌備委員會主席宋慶齡女士將爲大會主席、謂渠將主席大會、並表示日内將訪問吳市長及各國領事、且擬晋京一行、分訪中國政府要人、勸其勿作妨碍在華開會之行動、並謂吾蜚第一着、必須試圖消釋各方對於會議之褊見、僅此一事、或須經一二月始克有成云、</p>
<h3>劉崇傑昨抵滬</h3>
<p>中央社云、前外交部常務次長劉傑氏、行將出任駐德公使、原任駐德公使劉文島氏、則調任駐意公使、刻正分别徴詢德意兩國之同意、一俟徴得同意、即可明令發表、劉氏業將外部常次職務交卸完畢、前晚搭乘夜車來滬、昨晨八時許抵此、當即返寓休息、劉氏此來、係歡迎宋財長歸國、决定暫時留滬休息、一俟外使明令發表、再行出國赴任云、</p>

<h3>羅店昨日開市</h3>

知道回敎的事情，可以和回敎的人接觸，不要去看那反對回敎的書，在上海的人，可以和英美各回敎徒去談談，就可知道回敎的眞像了，現在西方的回敎進步很快而進步很大，不謂最近有許多出版物，好像是恭敬回敎的，其實一味亂說，目的在反對回敎，以致引起回敎徒的公憤，回敎的人，本不願攻擊别人，但是别人若故意攻擊回敎，那麽回敎徒一定要自己保衛的，我說這話幷不是示威，也不是提倡鬥爭，這是要請大家明白的，回敎是没有一點强逼人的意志，因爲宗敎是自由的。　　今天因爲時間怱促，只能把回敎在西方的狀况及各國回敎徒的數目，簡單的報告一下。　　我這次到中國來是學的，不是敎的，因爲中國是一個有古文化的國家，但是我所希望的是望中國的回敎徒能夠合作，推而至於西方回敎徒大家互相溝通，因爲回敎的精神是和平，幷目回敎徒都是弟兄，今天天氣很熱，蒙諸位前來聽講，我心中是十分的感謝。春秋和氣論  瘦鷗　　在　　上，十家之中，僅有九家的門上是黏著兩條紅紙對的，而在那第二道或是第三道的門上，這一副對的字句，更是千篇一　的寫着「和氣致祥，厚德　福。」　　這兩句話純粹長輩敎訓後輩的口吻，彷彿現在的「革命尙未成功，同志還　努力」一樣。而予弟們因爲常年總得在這八字中間出進的緣故，於使無意中得到了一種很深的印象，但是印象雖然人人都有，可是由印象而發生的結果，却也人各不同，有的果然是修養得非常和氣了，有的仍不免保存着由别種不良印象而造成的暴戾之氣，始終不改。　　我們中國人往往把和氣兩個字看做低　服小、其實是錯了！緣敝國人對子日本政府的一味屈服，那是另有一種說法，斷非和氣。和氣的意思是說，在别人封你並無顯著的侮辱或是侵犯的行動以前，你應該常用一種温和的態度去對待他，也就是說逢人常帶笑臉，力避拔　孔而已。　　以中國人的勇子對外屈服的行動而論，似乎和氣的人，一定作絕對多數了。事實上偏是顚倒着。尤其是那些公務人員，以及海觀，郵政，銀行，幾路等等的職員，更從不注意和氣這兩個字，該作什麽解釋。雖然這種人對于外國人是往往非常和氣的，當可不致引起國際交涉，然而對于自己的同胞，老是這樣盛氣相凌，敎外國人看了，不免也要好笑吧！　　再說普通社會上，因爲一方先不和氣而閙成的亂予，尤其是指不勝屈，甚至閙得打字司，坐監牢，推原其故，無非是略一不和氣的毛病，事到臨時，我想所有的人，斷無一個不深深地懊悔的。便是没有這種亂予發生，一個人不和氣，而使他自己所受的痛苦也就夠了。因爲人是一種非集羣不能生存的東西，如要你處處不知和氣，動　跟人家相駡相打，結果必致陷于孤立的地位，失却了一切的援助，到那時候你又勢必自己不和氣起來了，于是神明内疚，理智交責，很多因此鬰鬰而死的！　　所以說，和氣不僅是一種處世要訣，實在還是做人的起碼本領！手口眼的技術  翼　　内地人士都以爲上海是遍地黄金，遇到没辦法的時候，只要跑到上海來，便會立刻有辦法：這種以爲」，倒也未可厚非，至少是不全謬，上海的確比内地容易找飯吃。然而上海何以還會有這麽多的失業者呢？揣度原因，只怕他們是過於偏重胸中的學問，而忽視了手口眼的技術，所以就到處碰壁，無人請敎了。　　在上海尋求職業，事實上是一點不難的，可是要靠着胸中有學問，那倒的確是非常之難，憑你有满腹經綸，也是一個大錢不値，前人早已說過，所謂「满肚子文章充不得饑」是也，若是有一點手口眼的技術，便到處可以賣錢，馬路相士就是一個最好的例子。他們只消掛一幅圖在馬路邊的牆壁上，總有許多人站下來看，而且這看的許多人中，總有幾個要相面：相士輕輕的對着某一個人逗兩句，這個人就半推半就，又像無可如何似的由他去相了。於是相士的一隻手，接住了被相者的一隻手，另一隻手指束畫西，口裏滔滔地講，同時眼睛的技術更要緊，兩個眼珠子，隨着口内說話而轉動，說話隨着眼珠子怎樣轉動，而高低頓挫，彼此相應，一點兒不能亂最近上海的馬路相士忽然多起來，大槪就是了解於「满肚子文章充不得饑」，改而練習手口眼技術的人多了，羣趨於此道。可是技術也有精與不精的分别，眼與口能相應不亂的，生意一定是好，如果生意淸淡，即必是口眼不相應之故　　上海是個不可思議的大都會，儘有西裝革履的相士顧客。失業者們呵·此道大有可爲，趕緊收拾起胸中學問，練習這手口眼的技術罷·而且，有了這技術，不但可爲相士，别的事也都游刃有餘，神而明之，存乎其人罷了。神女們的領域  胡沉舟　　我坐在往金神父路去的，念一路公共汽車裏的右邊兒椅子上，車廂外是騒動的，車廂裏是那麽靜靜地，靜靜地。我以兩支眼兒，打已經給放下一大半的玻璃窗子，下意識地往个邊兒望。起先，我只看見好多赤着的肐膊，好多赤着的腿兒，好多搖着的蒲扇子···但這當兒，我瞧見，在走道上，在馬路裏·一大夥兒人丨男的，女的，老的，小的，團團站着一個圈子似的·又三三四四站着似的。　　我的眼兒閃電樣，往那夥兒人這麽的一掃。啊，他們的中央：好多白的臉子，好多黄的眼珠子，好多紅的嘴兒····好多笑丨好多淒然的苦笑啊！　　我暼見一個年紀約莫綫十五六歲的少女，打扮的平常的女學生樣，在拖一個大胖子，看那大胖子多傻哪·但伊淒然地苦笑着，苦笑着，狠命地拖着，拖着　　我的耳朶子依稀的聽到了一句兒：「到我那兒去坐一會兒吧！」　　聲音是怪尖銳的，尖銳的鬼兒呌樣。接着，又是一陣兒淒然的苦笑。　　「這麽早伊們就跑出來拉客人啦？」　　「夏天是特别早。」　　「捕房裏不會干涉嗎？」　　「干涉甚麽？伊們出『淫業捐』的呀！」　　「唔，出『淫業捐』的！」是坐在我前邊兒的兩位的對話，打破了車廂裏的靜默的空氣。　　「唉，野鷄們眞是不少啊！」　　「那是農村經濟破產的象徴喲！」　　「唉，時代不是時代了，簡直是『淫亂世界』啊！」　　丨那是農村經濟破產的象徴喲！　我把腦袋子轉過去，我望見說這話兒的那個靑年，跟跟他說話的那個老人啵丨啵丨啵，我們的車子往前飛，只一刹那，飛過了神女們的領域。　　現在我望見：　　大時鳴鐘的長短針正扔上了九字。　　鐘兒上的「紅錫包」三個大字，跳着：「紅」，「錫」，「包『：「紅錫包」。「紅」········跳着，跳着。五十年後  龍　　民國七十二年某月某日，同胞們因中央軍規復了東北四省之外，又收回了大連台灣等處之故，舉行盛大的慶祝會。　　某某三大國，因見中國强盛，自動將香港安南外蒙等地，拱手璧還。　　各位抵抗將軍，到處建立銅像，供人瞻仰，關岳祭祀，大受影響。　　某月日，中國被推爲國聨主席委員，升爲等强國。　　各外輪因無客可搭，無貨可載，故將所有商輪，悉數廉價售與招商局，於是招商局執世界航業之牛耳。　　這時候的中國兵艦，接連起來，可以環繞全國沿海岸而有餘，空中飛機之多，竟然人盡可乘。　　中大學生對於「租界」「領事」等字句，須翻查辭源·才可知其意義。　　國土日　外侮紛乘，東也救國，西也抗捐，都是廢事，都是笨伯，其實只要講求衛生延長五十年壽數，就可看到興旺氣象，手之舞之，足之蹈之哩。東北四連長  張恨水　　第十四回　授室多艱徘徊憂後顧　邀朋小聚　　記前塵　　有一天我遇到第二營的何連長，監督着兩名士兵，抬了兩大籐簍子破鞋爛襪子，倒進土坑裏去。那簍子由我面前經過，臭得我只是要吐出来。我笑對何連長說，鞋襪臭到這個樣子，縱然抬走了，恐怕屋子裏還有臭味。他倒說得乾脆，笑道可不就是這樣嗎？不過他有他的法子，買了一塊錢花露水满屋子一灑，這就有什麽臭味，都聞不着了。趙自强道：老關，我在東城經過的時候，遇到外國兵，心裏就老是那樣想看，他們的衣服，全是呢的，皮的，合着身材，是　一點也不大不小。他們也是拿八塊大洋···關耀武道：别人，人家養一個大兵，至少抵咱們養十個八個的。咱們不是人口，只是畜類，怎能和人家打比呢？趙自强笑道：不往下說了，閑談着又引起了你的牢騒來了，關耀武道：檢閱的委員，大槪快要來了，我們得開始準備着。說時，他拿起帽子來，帶有一封信，落在樓板上。趙自强一變腰將信檢了起來，遞給關耀武道：這上面寫的是城内關緘，大嫂子來的信嗎。關耀武並不接信，歎了一口氣，没有作聲。隨着兩手一揚，懶洋洋的樣子，他倒坐下來了。趙自强又將信皮上的字看了一遍，也並没有什麽错誤於是向他望着道：你是什麽意思？關耀武搖搖頭道：你瞧那信，你要提起來，我眞腦袋痛。趙自强這倒有些不解，於是就拆開信來看。上寫着：　　耀武我夫台鑒：别來又是半月，諒身體康健。甚爲馳念。家中存錢，早已用盡，本想使王四哥家之會欵，標會之日，寫利太少，爲他人標去。加之前日二兒忽發燒熱，時久不退，只昨將妻首飾當去，以作醫藥之費。望羣接信後，千萬來家，免妻焦灼。即祝近安妻袁氏上言（一七一）婦女樂園簡易的修指術  波光　　西洋女子，對於修理指甲是很講究的。我們中國女子，在民國以前是不知道修指的，並且把指爪留得很長，　垢納汚，作事又不便利。　　現代的女子，把指甲修理得很光潔，修指的用品，最好用指甲刀修剪，比較剪刀來得整齊，修好了不必用小銼磨光，因爲銼刀久用，指甲是要成夾灰的，只要用細砂皮輕輕地磨擦一下就是了。磨擦之後，用上等香肥皂温水洗凈，塗少許甘油（西藥房有售）於指上，就會光澤整潔，甘油能保護指膜。　　指油可以不必塗，假使要塗，「　丹」比較好些！中國指油太厚，塗來不匀，有一種做得氣味太濃。希望改良！最新的面容整飾法  人萍　　不久以前，我在跟慕上看到，爰就記憶力的所及，走筆紀之如左：　　先以水洗凈面部，不待其過乾，卽以香粉撲，繼以軟綿之絹帕輕輕拂去；（此時宜對鏡自照，不使剩有粉跡，）俟拂凈後，可有保膚脂或潤面膏塗於手心向面部雙頰間摩去（務使潤遍），摩匀後，待其稍燥，可再洒以少許撲粉，拂去後，隨取臙脂膏塗「中心點」於頰問，再以手徐向上移動（切忌臙脂過多，若已過多，可攙以香粉少許，唯須由深化淡方佳），此後畫眉者可畫眉，畫眉時須由眉内端向外沿去，畫眉工程完竣後，則以口紅塗深點於上下唇中間，然後雙唇緊閉，微向左右摩擦之，至有一到處，可用舌尖微舐之，最妙能於塗口紅前，先數以脂油少許，如此比較的易於匀稱。　　笑誌：欲保持唇紅間較久者，可於塗唇紅後，再微敷以脂油，不僅光澤，卽有「甜心」者，亦可多吻幾下，而不致易於浴去矣！美容須知  佩萸　　不適當不合宜的飲食，最易損害容貌的美，損害的程度比任何事物來得利害。所以要有姣艶的容貌，飲食應有適當的時間，次數，分量和合定的食料。　　如欲永遠保持「處女美」，必須避免鹽，乾肉，香料，醃漬品，過量的醬汁等，肉與菜蔬切碎而混合的食品，已經二次燒煮過的，也不宜　　好牙齒是美容的要素，淸潔牙齒的用物，没有比蘋果再好的了。　　用冷水洗面是很好的，可以剌激皮膚，使血液的流動加快些，這樣便能把玟瑰一般的鮮紅顏色，帶至面部，由兩頰上湧出來。　　眞要達到美容的目的，相當的運動，萬不可少，這一點很是重要，應當牢記，應當實行的　洗了熱水浴後，應用一塊浸透冷水的海綿，摩擦全身。　　步行是一種良好的運動，人人可以實行的。婦女們常常躊躇，以爲没有空閒工夫去作較長距離的步行。其實是很容易的，例如出外常坐車的，便有機會做步行的運動，就是出去的時候，要幹要緊事，不能不坐車，在幹完了事回家的時候，不妨勞動兩足走走了。如其路程過長的，不妨一半乘車，一半步行，這樣不是有機會實行步行的運動了嗎？　　假使一位姑娘没有「愛神之弓Cupid'sBow形的口，不用自怨自艾，只要稍加注意，略施小技，便可克服天然的缺點，所謂「人定可以勝天」。克服的方法，就是行口的按摩，用指尖從嘴唇的兩邊至中央，向内撫摩；假使嘴唇過於凸出，那麽向外撫摩，卽可如願以償。要使嘴唇柔嫩，應用少許緩和的潤膚膏。</h3>

<p>申報醫藥週刊焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷（續）  余雲岫　　至於腸癰肺癰用湯藥醫好的事，當然是有的，我記起了一椿近事、我的老友植物學家鍾憲先生告訴我說：「在三十多年前，我有一個好朋友害了肺癰，醫生丨當然是那時候的貴國醫，丨没有辦法，我急極了、無可思量。翻閱騐力，新編，說是臭醃芥菜滷汁柈生豆腐，可治肺癰，我想這也不見得有大害，就如法泡製起來，眞是靈騐，喫了不多幾時，就大吐許多膿血，從此就好了。」這件事，若使在現在敎們診療起來，没有一個人說道：「肺癰是極危險的，而且最靠得住的辦法　，是用肺外科手術，在現在時代的，成績還不算十二分靠得住，是有危險性的，」我可以料得科學醫師，一定是這樣說，若使鍾先生是貴國醫，用臭醃芥汁和生豆腐的法一服即愈，那一定要大吹特吹，說西醫怎樣靠不住，怎樣無能力、中國的方術，怎樣靈騐，怎樣簡便；但是仔細研究起來，臭醃芥菜汁拌豆腐，他的色相，他的氣味，不過是引嘔吐就是了。並不是對於肺癰的病源，肺癰的發炎機轉，和其化膿工作，有什麽特殊的消退抑制作用，不過嘔吐的時候，使得胸部壓榨起來，把膿胞壓榨破裂，把膿擠出來就是了，但是這個膿胞，生在和氣管相近的地方，壓榨的時候，剛剛向氣管方面破口，那就可以把膿吐出，或者可以一吐而愈，若是生在和肺表面相近的地方，壓榨起來，就向肺外面的方面的方向潰破，裏面的膿，就流出到胸腔中去，就變成膿胸了，那裏會好呢，所以臭醃芥菜汁的療法，是危險的方法！不是合理的方法！醫好了是幸中偶合！焦先生所說治好肺癰的湯藥，不過臭醃芥菜汁一類東西就是了，不過徼倖於萬一，逃不出章　所說的「幸中偶合」範圍。不過在不曉得「從學理上探討」的人們，以爲非常靈騐就是了。我們那老友鍾先生，他親身做了這事，却不以爲非常可賓貴的方術，他始終懐疑，這才是有科學思想，科學頭腦的學者態度！　　講到腸癰，最多者就是肓腸炎，肓腸炎這個病，大約有百分之八十至百分之九十，是可以用内科保守療法治愈的，其不幸而死的只是少數，所以現代内科醫對於肓腸炎，多數主張用保守療法，但是合理的療法，當然以外科手術爲第一位。前年我有一個老友，他的公子在杭州，害了肓腸炎，杭州的醫師，多數主張用外科手術，他到上海來請敎一個日本的内科醫丨這時候，外科療法的時期，也差不多過去了、丨却主張用保留療法，於是正合心意，丨諸君要曉得，我們貴國人的心理，最怕是動手動脚，動刀動槍，丨請他到杭州去治療，居然好了，於是乎我的那位朋友，就非常稱贊日本那位内科醫、以爲畢竟我們中國人不及外國貨，我聽了，也只是笑笑。日本人已經把他愛子醫好了，而且把他所最怕的外科療法避免了，他要稱贊，有什麽法子阻擋他呢？唉！危險！若是我那朋友，不喜歡用外科療法，却去請敎國醫來治療，兩帖三帖湯藥，慢慢兒好起來了，那末杭州那班醫師，更没有面目了。若是撞在焦先生的手裏，怕不當做一個保護國醫館的好材料，拿出來告告國人麽？焦先生把湯藥治好肺癰腸癰，來向我們攻擊，來向國人宣傳，據我的意思，還是再愼重一下，考量一直，値得不値得做攻擊我們的工具？値得不値得宣傳？可憐智識幼稚的國人，是可以欺瞒的，只恐怕逃不過「從學理上探討」的人們譏笑。至於某要人背癰的話，更是無聊，背癰這個毛病，在國醫是當做非常重要的一個症候，在我們却没有看得這樣重大的因爲是外科手術進步之後，是狠有辦法的，若敎國醫們治療起來，不但至今不能收口，恐怕在生命上的危險性，着要增加得許多哩。疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　㈩㈥麻瘋病　　（問）麻瘋病，在我國的舊名是什麽？　　（答）魔瘋病，古稱癩，别名天刑，惡疾等。　　（問）西又名是什麽？　　（答）德文名Aussatz，拉丁文Lepra，英文是Leprosy，法文是Lepre，　　(問)麻瘋的病原是什麽？　　（答）是一種桿狀菌，呌做癞菌。　　（問）這種病在什麽地方流行？　　（答）麻瘋病，幾乎全世界都有，並不限於什魔地方。但我國在兩廣福建雲南等省，流行最盛。　　（問）麻瘋病的病原，從身體的那一都分侵入傳染的？　　（答）現在尙未十分明瞭。大概皮膚和鼻黏膜的小創，是侵入門户。因爲病人的鼻涕中，細菌含得最多。　　（問）麻瘋病的年齡有一定嗎？　　（答）二十歲到四十歲的時候最多；，三歲以下的小兒，絕無。　　（問）傳染後經過幾年發病？　　（答）經過數年到數十年的潛伏期發病。　　（問）發病的時候，有没有前驅症狀？　　（答）有的。大都是頑固的鼻炎，風灦性或神經痛性疼痛等。　　（問）發病後的症狀怎樣？　　（答）普通由局部所見而分别爲結節癩和神經癩二型。　　（問）結節癩的病狀怎樣？　　（答）病人的皮膚，生圓形或不正形的赤褐色斑紋（斑紋癩），肥厚而成結節。起初局部知覺過敏，不久，來知覺鈍麻或消失。後來成潰腱或壞疽狀。最常見的是顏面擁腫，眉毛鬚髮脫落，成所謂獅子顏。各部黏膜，也同樣有變化，鼻中隔穿孔，鼻梁陷没。此外見淋巴腺，尤如頷下腺，頸腺的腫脹，睪丸萎縮，月經異常等。　　（答）神經癩除了結節癩的皮膚症狀之外，有神經炎症狀，神經肥厚疼病，瘍反射，起初亢進後來消失。知覺，麻痺。最初侵痛神和温神。後來全部知覺消失，同時運動障碍。肌萎縮，尤如拇指球，小指球。骨間肌等都瘦削，很像鷹爪，所以稱爲鷹爪手，面肌也削瘦。　　（問）這兩型病狀，是不是各别發現？　　（答）不是。大多混合而來的。　　（問）病勢再進行，怎樣？　　（答）四肢因神經麻痺營養障碍的結果，致指趾手足。逐漸成壞死脫落，（截斷癩）　　（問）這種麻瘋病，有没有治愈希望。　　（答）很難。大槪結節癩不出十年，神經癩不出二十年，一定致命。　　（問）有療治的藥劑嗎？　　（答）現在大都用大楓子油或這一類的製劑内服或注射。病人同時行硫黄浴，炙治法等。　　（問）預防的方法怎樣？　　（答）把麻瘋病人，收容於特設的麻瘋病院中隔離起來。他們的咯痰，鼻涕，和尿等，都須焚燬，用品行嚴重的消毒。藥房營業之眞義（二）  民藥房營業爲專門職業，而其服務社會之立場，尤在乎崇尙道德，前述英國之樂房營業情形中，可知其梗槪也。他如政府管理藥商，爲國家法令完備之表現，非特英國爲然，即歐洲其他國家，莫不嚴於設施，以杜流弊，而藥商繩守法令，有厲行數十年而未見疏犯者。誠以藥商之道德，與操業之精神，政府之崇視職業，與護衛藥商，交相合作，始獲實效，决非互爲猜虞能踐其萬一耳。　　法國之藥房營業巴黎之藥業約三百萬之居民有藥房一千五百所，故每二千居民中，即有藥房一所，其附廓一千五百萬之居民，對於藥房數十之比，亦如之，法國所有藥房，均在藥房法管轄之下，其藥房法大致與美國之飲食物藥物法令，與好立生麻醉條例相似，且執行嚴厲，無或縱或枉之弊。法國藥師之地位，頗爲卓越，均係受高深之藥學敎育者任之，其尤足驚人者，則在實施藥房法已厲行三十年之久，而未嘗或怠。其藥房雖無額定數，但每一藥師祇准設一藥房，不過同時可與其他藥師合股經營另一藥房，倘藥房主一旦死後，須依照條例，於一年内轉於别人，又在巴黎亦有普通藥商店，其營業以專售香料，及其他商品，但不　　　　，與正式藥房不同之點，正式　　營業時間，每日上午八時半至下午七時，全城共分爲若干區域，每區域在每隔五星期須担任房，）以利病家，亦云週矣。　　法國藥房事業，具有科學上之歷史，爲吾人深刻之紀念者，有著名藥師派來的氏JosephPeleiter爲法國藥業中之最有貢獻者，其在一八一八年發現士的年鹼，一八一九發現波羅新鹼，又於一八二○年發現金鷄納霜鹼，此種迪啓科學關鍵之大工作，與今日法國藥房事業之發達，宜夫有優美環境與燦爛紀念，𢌞繞於脫姆飛一帶之藥房矣。　　比利時之藥房營業　　普魯賽有藥房三百五十所，分配於居民七十六萬中，爲一與二千二百之比，正式藥房亦無額定數，與法國同，普通藥商店爲數甚少，其營業祇售包裝成藥，及他種商品，其正式藥房服務時間，上午八時至下午七時，星期日及節日全城以十家藥房當値業務，其他藥房，得以休息半日。藥物之稱量制度爲邁當制，（MetuicSystem）但不論液體或固體，均由重量稱取，注射劑廣用　瓶，故不售注射藥片，藥房不兼分析或顯微鏡檢查工作，（歐洲有數處藥房，有此等工作，見後，）因另有專門家可以委托，又比利時之正式藥房均受藥房法之管理，而普通藥商店之經理人，亦有一定資格，是與法國普通藥商店之不同，因法國之普通藥商店不售成藥故耳。（未完）科學的達生爲（續）  俞松筠　　丙·羊水過多症的豫兆　　卵膜的最裏一層側膜，就呌羊膜，這種羊膜裏的液體，稱爲羊水。胎兒浮在這種羊水之中，所以外面的打撲衝突等行動，不致於直接影響到胎兒去，同時，胎兒的運動，也不致於碍着母體。等到臨盆的當兒胎膜破裂，射出羊水，稱爲破水，因此產道得能滑潤。　　這種羊膜裏的羊水，如較尋常過於多時，那未；腹部擴張，愈加顯明，在足部上也象脚氣病一樣的大起浮腫，那時又很象雙胎妊娠的形狀，若有這種症狀的疾病，就是稱爲羊水過多症。　　丁·羊水過多症的症狀　　羊水過多症最激烈的時候，大抵在妊娠七八個月，就要早產，假使能夠保存到臨月的時候，那未；胎兒身體，亦必浮腫，或者發生所謂腦水腫的腫物，而且有時胎兒部，只有一半，這是稱爲半頭兒，或竟腦部完全没有，這是稱爲無腦兒。又有胎兒因在這種過多的羊水之中，自由活動，最易發生位置的不正規，譬　如胎兒位置横向臀部向下，其至於臍帶捲着兒頭，因此窒息，或者臍帶纒結，妨碍血行，就令胎兒死亡，所以這種羊水過多症，胎兒竟有三分之二的死亡率，都由這種障碍而起。　　羊水過多症，對於母體的影響，乃因羊水過多，胃腸及胸部，都受壓迫，以致大起消化不良的害處，或者；呼吸因難，甚爲不適。又因陣痛微弱，以致分娩延時，又因產後出血過度，惹起危險的症狀，依統計而言，在每百次分娩當中，约有五六次，而且經產婦比較初產婦。來得容易發生。　　戊·羊水過多症的原因　　羊水過多症，有兩個原因，有由母體而來，亦有來自胎兒，由母體而來的，因爲母體曾患白血病慢性貧血腎臟炎心臟炎梅毒糖尿病，以致變化血液的性質，妨碍血液的循環。由胎兒而來的，大抵出於胎兒心臟的障碍胎盤的畸形，卵膜的異常，雙胎的妊娠等原因爲最多數。　以上所述各種病症的婦人，一經妊娠，不可不預先警備，固然不言而喻，但是一朝明瞭了症狀，尤其應在醫師嚴重監督之下，等待臨盆，而且羊水過多症，很易變更胎兒的位置，在臨盆的當兒，亦因陣痛微弱，很費周章，而起徬徨。又有產後出血過多，甚或臍帶較胎兒先行產出等事。</p>

<p>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）  龐京周　　第六章醫藥敎育與刋物　　第一節新醫藥敎育　　上海市。因爲物質文明。設備較易。又因人才薈萃。所以新醫藥敎育機關最多。以現存的八個學校計算。（助產學校另列）。倒要佔全國總數中什分之四光景。所以在數量上。敢說上海是全國醫藥敎育的中心。而這八校中間。就含着上述的二種不同的方準。有的自稱造就高深研究家。有的自稱造就社會實用人材。而在某一方面。偏要在學術上與人互較短長。其實自稱高深的學校。若没有眞實的好敎師。也不免失之太誇。而自稱專造實用人材之學校。招生督課。也未免失之太濫。這是使我們刻刻關心的事。倘拿外國的醫學校來比。那麽莫說國人自辦的私立學校。就是上海幾個國立學校的經濟。設備。師資。醫院。都還不行。倘使拿較大的目光。看一看全國新醫藥的眞相。那麽就覺得上海那些學校的畢業生。又没有一個不是需要的咧。我如今把大上海市的醫藥學校名稱。性質。大槪記在下面。　　㈠國立同濟大學醫學院。性質丨國立。學生約二百十人。專任敎師十六人。醫院借着寳隆醫院。並非自有之附屬醫院。　　㈡國立上海醫學院。性質國立。學生約六十八人。專任敎師三十二人。兼任敎師五人。醫院還借着紅十字會總醫院及其他醫院。並非自有之附屬醫院。　　㈢震旦大學醫學院。性質法國敎會帮助私立。學生約八十五人。專任敎師八人。兼任敎師二人。醫院即同性質之廣慈醫院爲實習機關。　　㈣聖約翰大學醫學院。性質美國敎會帮助私立。學生約五十三人。專任敎師七人。兼任敎師二十人。醫院借用同仁醫院。並非自有附屬醫院。　　㈤上海女子醫學院。性質美國敎會帮助私立。學生約二十五人。專任敎師十七人。兼任敎師十四人。醫院即同性質之西門婦孺醫院爲實習機關。　　㈥同德醫學院。性質國人私立。學生約一百七十五人。專任敎師五人。兼任敎師十二人。醫院自設之附屬醫院規模太小。　　㈦東南醫院。性質國人私立。學生約四百二十人。專任敎師十四人。兼任敎師九人。醫院有眞茹上海第一第二兩附醫院。惜限於經濟。醫院之規模尙欠完美。　　㈧中法藥學院。性質國立。經費由比庚欵中撥用。學生數未詳。專任敎師約五人。（未完）診餘隨筆（續）  陳方之隨筆之中，間涉醫理，務以通俗爲主，還請大方見諒。不虞之譽　　從前我在漢口的時候。蒙一位姓尹的同學介紹，到一家李姓家裏去看病，病人是一個三十餘歲的女太太，據說：「病已半月，危險萬分，中醫說是冬温，西醫說是肺炎。昨今兩日，中西醫都推手了，中醫說，只看今明天，西醫說，只有打强心針的辦法了。先生看看，有什麽妙手回春的辦法？」我給她一看，體温攝氏三十九度，發熱頗高的，脈每分鐘一百六十次，神志稍稍不淸，是重病的徴象。肺部證候，在左肺下葉，有濁音及水泡音，但右肺下葉，濁音雖少，也有種種水泡音，以我當時據證推斷，其肺炎或者先發在右，後蔓延到左的。或者有潛伏結核，被肺炎引起來，變作活動性的；或者是肺結核爲主，受了感冒，一方舊病增劇，一方新氣管支炎併發的，我料她是後者爲多，所以將電溶性銅，姑且一試。這個電溶性銅，是普通不常用的注射藥，牠的標榜，是說用於結核性疾患，但是尙未得到有定評的試用品，我想這個病人，確有他醫所說的險象，不妨乘此機會，拿這個嘗試品來一試，（當然强心劑同時並用的），不料居然奇效，第二天症狀减輕大半，從此漸漸調理，就復元了，病家稱我爲神醫，到三四年後，還稱揚不置，而我本人實在聽之有愧色。　　我何故有愧色呢，上文我在診斷病名處，不是說了三個「或者」麽，是我診這個病，顯然還不是十分有把握，幸而一擊偶中，總算把病醫好了，但究竟用這個嘗試品，是不作爲訓的，還是眞的電溶性銅秦效呢？還是病已轉機，會逢其適呢？老實說，我自己還莫名其妙，這不是不虞之譽麽？　　本來處在是非不明的中國，毁譽是無定的，尤其是我們醫業，差不多個個都靠「不虞之譽」四個字混飯吃的。能自然治愈的疾病，用些無關緊要的「甘草」「阿斯畢林」等去唐塞，其醫好呌做貪天之功，因爲有這天功可貪，所以無論什麽樣醫生，都能在中國混飯吃，天放這個功給人貪，正是他好生之德呢。轟傳一世的某國醫用黄耆醫某名人的腎炎，那個黄耆，不過與我的電溶性銅同欄罷了。　　醫生的義務，以確斷病名爲第一，用藥精當，尙在其次，但新醫學的規則，要確斷病名，往往須有病原或病理的證據，不是憶測所能了事，尤以内科爲然。這李宅說，「發病第一天，請眞正西醫看的，是美國人馬大夫，他說恐怕是肺炎，倘然有痰，要檢檢痰看。但病人的素體，雖稍稍有痰，一到了發熱時，反面没有痰了，而且吃了馬醫生藥之後，起初雖好，過了幾個鐘頭，反而大寒大熱，爾時周圍的人，都說西醫太覇道，不如改請中醫，中醫請了汪瑞峯，吃了他五七帖藥，平和是果然平和些，然而熱始终不退，所以中途又請了一位某德醫，也說是肺炎，要打針的，。打針之後，每次發汗，病人很乏原，於是又吃中醫楊聞川的藥，到也平平，昨日下午，忽然寒冷戰慓，脈微氣促，楊醫生說：病症變了，很凶險，只看明天，本家慌了，快快請同仁會醫院東洋醫生，也說很危險，要檢檢痰看，打了一枚强心針而去。」我是最後去看的了，到了我，是没有檢痰的時間了，病人正在氣緊發厥的時候，你若以從容不迫的態度，說是要檢痰而後治病，病家是决不願意的，所以就此糊裏糊塗把病治好了。但是看官聽說，這位病人，開始就說要檢痰，到了末了，終是没有檢，不知道她究竟有没有結核菌，或痰裏的肺炎雙球菌的狀態如何，始終没有弄淸楚，在中國診病，大抵如此，糊裏糊塗活了，；糊裏糊塗說國家快亡了；謹守糊塗，正是中國人的本分。　　本例的病名診斷，如果眞的不差是肺炎，如果眞性的肺炎，其病原是雙球菌，其開始以發冷發抖爲多，其經過多在七八日後驟然出汗退熱，呌做分利，牽延性而異型的，比較訋少，我所以有種種的據證憶測，從憶測而徼倖，得到一家的感謝，愛之有愧，所以在此自白。（未完）</p>

<p>自由談創作與史實  豈凡　　用讀小說的眼光來讀史，史實就成了創作的故事，因爲時間的延綿速續性，一切的史都成了前一代的續集，善哉曹聚仁先生的話說：「史幾乎無所謂創作，每　史的作品都是續作」。這裏的史字作史實解，有更確當的意義。　　續作的所以受譏彈，大槪是創業難守成不易之故吧，比方元朝的崛起漠北，一時豈不轟轟烈烈，武功的顯赫簡直是空前的，但其長支的占據中國土地只昨八十年，而其治績之平庸又是出類拔萃，這樣的虎頭蛇尾，倘使作爲創作看，作爲成告思汗傳的續集看，豈不是該受譏笑的嗎？這正同寫回小說的用全力寫畢了第一回而才氣全消，第二回以下是無法再維持了，這樣的創作也可以給人看的嗎？不過我意這還是可恕的，因爲一個人的才力有限，做不好是實在做不好而無法挽救的，如果他己竭盡其能去做了，我們應該原諒。　　章回小說重在故事的有曲折有變化，比方我們現在的史實，當作章回小說看，那確是一回一回很巧妙而且引人入勝的小說，一件故事的轉變，往往很自然很合理，而實際上已暗中巧換了一個中心點。我以爲這是很好的創作而不能是續作，可惜史實在牠的性質上，不能避免是續作，而我們也有過辛亥革命國民革命等等一時曾呌人興奮的故事爲前驅。這也就是續作不免於受譏彈的天定的命運。　　照純粹的理論說來，一切事業都是屬於羣衆的，但事實並不完全如此，我國積弱假使說是全國國民的不爭氣，那反而是呌應負責任的人逃了他的責任。人羣固然可以全體負責，但有不呌負責不許負責的歷世相沿的制度習慣，正像創作是一個人在星子　做出來之後，却推說社會環境不好，所以他的創作不好才是正理，凡有好的創作都該打倒的。這一種理論固然通順，但不嫌過於通順嗎？　　自然，錯的不在理論而在事實，但有此種事實存在，則該種理論也就難通行了。那麽事貫徹該種論的，便得起來造事實，把創作從書房中個人手底下奪出來，使成爲社會羣衆的作品，而史實也要由羣集的力量來推動展開。曹先生的「相信文學之有待於續作與史籍之有待於續作」大槪是這個相信與相信這個吧。　　前次談續，得曹先生論續作的補充說明，再使我得一機會來追加這點意見，是很感謝的，書此幷答曹先生。殘廢美  魏猛克　　畫家在自己的畫室中工作，一面舞動畫筆，一面偏着頭看模特兒，忽而退後，忽而又走上前去，很得意的，想：我勝利了。　　「討厭！」　　············　　畫家的工作突然中止，將畫具小心放下，豐肥紅潤的圓臉上，露出永遠輕快的微笑：搓一搓手，便走向斜倚在沙發上，撅着嘴的妻前，彎了腰說：　　「親受的，我相信你今天不會生氣的吧，你預備慶賀我····丨丨討厭！丨丨不，你今天不會生氣的，我相信，。你看這模特兒多麽美呢，這簡直是羅丹的模特兒。你不是看過羅丹的老歐爾米哀的照片麽，這雖然是男性，但同老歐爾米哀一樣老弱得可憐，但這正是他的美，只有藝術家，偉大的藝術家羅丹，才知道這樣的美的，也只有我···尤其，你看，這眞是難能可貴，他那截去兩脚，單賸兩腿的殘廢美，是羅丹還未發現的啦！勝利了，我，哈哈····」　　「討厭！連這新地氈也給他弄髒了，呸！這一身爛泥。」　　「那不要緊，爲了藝術。告訴你，我的氣運也太好了，剛才，我到先施去給你扯華爾紗衫子，一出門，就遇着他了，他在馬路上打滾，並且哀訴着，我從他的姿態和發音上，即刻發現了他的美，尤其，是羅丹未發現的那種殘廢美。　　「至於代價，我早已和他約好了，每次僅僅是四毛小洋。　　「親愛的，我的成名就要靠這一張傑作了，這是與衆不同，特具作風的傑作，是藝術上的新發現啦·····怎麽？你不舒適吧，我陪你開開心好了。」　　「吠！拿去，四毛錢，聽着，明朝也是一樣。」他轉身對模特兒說。　　模特兒霍地坐起，兩個銀角子　地跳進了他的褲腰，由幾根骨頭撑起來的那張無表情的臉，也暫時蒙上了满足的笑影。他用兩手代替了脚，一怔一怔走出去了。　　　「娘姨！拖地板，快！」畫家的妻，撅着嘴緊跟在模特兒後面。　　　　　　　畫家看看自己快要完成的傑作，豐肥紅潤的圓臉上，露出永遠輕快的微笑。死刑  聖旦　　秃頭喘吁吁地跑上茶樓，抺着額上的汗珠兒，嚷：　　「犯人來啦！看呀！」　　「啊啊！」　　茶客同時應着，立刻擠满了一窗口，向樓下觀看，亂哄哄地。　　方五老爺習慣地捋着鬍子，嘴角邊浮起幾絲笑紋。他想：王四喜這個頑户除掉之後，鄭莊就可以太平了。像去年那麽的大熟年歲，人家都還淸田租，獨有他不還，假如再不乘這個機會把他送上鬼門關去，以後就越發糟糕了。··　　索郎索郎的　聲從喧嚷的空氣中響澈過來，接着，攅動着的人頭之中，便露出一枝白布旗，上而寫着「搶犯王四喜」五個大字，「王」字的中央，點着一個紅點，這是標明已經「過堂，而且「騐明正身」了。　　犯人的兩手，反縳着，頭髮披了满臉，蓬蓬的，眼睛像閉了一樣，臉色是白而帶靑。　　盒子砲隊，大刀隊，長槍隊，密密地圍着犯人的四周。監刑官騎着棕色馬，驕　地，嚴肅地，跟在犯人的後面。隨後就是「看彈人」（ＸＸ縣槍斃匪盜，呌作「看彈人一」的觀衆；男男女女，老老少少，挨擠着，喧嚷着。　　犯人過去了，茶客都發瘋似的奔下來，樓板格格地響着。　　秃頭悄悄地向方五老爺說：　　「可憐見的，十足的響下佬！」　　「唔唔。」方五老爺憎厭似的答應着。　　刑塲到啦！秃頭也擠了進去。　　維持秩序的警察隊，掛着裝剌的長槍在觀衆中出動，用樹枝分開了讓犯人入塲的路。俄而，索郎索郎的　聲遠遠的送來，鎭壓了觀衆的喧嚷。直到犯人跑進刑塲的中央，潮浪般的觀衆，立刻擁擠攏來，成了一個大包圍。，王四喜灰白色的臉上，滲出幾顆汗珠，嘴唇有些噏動，心頭突地跳動：死不明白，鄭莊農民搶米的一天，不但没有去參加，而且還病在床上，那是都知道的，然而鄕長，村長，丨等等，一口吃咬定是我主使，田主方五老爺，也合他們夥兒，没寃没仇的。　　他這麽摸摸胡胡地想着，似乎祇剩了顫抖的分兒，什麽都記不起來了。他偶然把眼皮睜開瞥見給方五老爺敢租的秃頭蹲在前面，笑吟吟地。　　砰！　　槍聲越過了喧嚷的空氣，王四喜跌倒了，　從前腦直嘴出來，眼睛睜得圓圓的，在草地上滾　　，　丨　　「没有死啦！再给他一槍吧！」監刑官在馬上嚷，把臂膞揮了個弧形的姿勢。　　砰！　　是觀衆拍掌的聲音。　　晚上，方五老爺在ＸＸ樓宴客；科長，委員，丨微笑的喝着，喫着。秃頭拿了開聽「大英牌」，恭恭敬敬地分送。烟從每一個人　着的指頭上　出來。　　廣大而靜寂的刑塲上，一匹花的狗在那兒舐着地上的餘血。談狐仙  唐弢　　我忝生在中國，耳朶裏聽慣了狐仙的事跡，而且也確乎曾碰見過幾只類似傳說的狐仙。因此肚子裏有些印象，萬一不吐，怕會害上憂鬱病，跳進黄浦江裏去，有負「愛惜民命」者在江邊釘立木牌的盛意。　　但我所知道的終究有限。據說狐是狡猾的東西，種類甚繁，大别爲二，即是華狐和洋狐。洋狐不一定是仙，雖然伊索寓言裏的狐也會講話，但這明明是寓言，是假借的寄托。華狐則不然，在中國，没有狐則已，一有狐，那就非仙不可！　　狐仙的形成，由於苦心修鍊的很少，大都是取法採補：化成油頭滑腦的「洵美且都」的小白臉，身上洒些外國香水，掩去一身狐臭，再用國產宮粉把臉皮搽得厚厚的，尾巴藏在褲襠裏，放出種種媚態，勾引那般穢德彰聞的侯門小姐，得了一注横財之後，便藉着文字畫片和印刷術的力量，專向一般入世未深，靑春的活力正在奔騰著的貞男和處女進攻。爲著在自己名下添一個仙字，不惜把靑年門强好得面黄肌瘦，形消骨立，終至一命嗚呼。這便是狐仙的伎倆丨　　些不肯相信狐仙的硬漢子，就往往受着牠的捉弄。牠並不須要事實，高興玩就玩！放火燒去人家的眉毛，把馬桶套在人家的頭上等等，總之，幸災樂禍，卑鄙齷齪，惟有牠幹得最巧妙！　　附庸風雅，哼幾句「我愛你愛」的肉麻詩，也是牠的拿手。要是你明明白白的指出牠不通，牠就會惱羞成怒，老遠的飛一塊磚瓦過來，打得你頭破血流。　　仙人本來是六根淸靜的，但狐仙却喜歡擠在人叢裏搗亂，一直到被人們捉住了尾巴。　　這便是狐仙，這便是由狡猾的狐狸變成的狐仙！女人（四）  沈從文　　當她發覺了男子中卽或年紀到了四十五歲，還想在自己身邊裝作天眞爛漫的神氣，認爲妨碍到她自己自由時，就抛開了男子們，常常帶領了幾個年幼的女孩，駕了白色小船，向海中駛去。在一　羣女孩中間她處處像個母親，照料得衆人極其周到，但當幾人在沙灘上胡閙時，則最頑皮最天眞的也仍然推她。　　她能獨唱獨舞。　　她穿着任何顏色任何質料的衣服，皆十分相稱，壞的不顯出俗氣，好的也不顯出奢華。她說話時聲音引人注意，使人快樂。　　她不獨使男子傾倒，所有女子也無一不十分愛她。　　但這就是一個謎，這爲上帝特别關切的女孩子，將來應當屬誰？　　就因爲這個謎，集會中便有萬千男子皆發着痴，心中思索着，苦惱着，林蔭裡，沙灘上，帳幕旁，大淸早有人默默的單獨的踱着躺着，黄昏裡出同樣如此。大家皆明白「一切路皆可以走近羅馬」那句格方，却不明白有什麽方法，可以把這女人的心。「一切美麗皆使人痴呆」故這美麗的女孩，本身所到處，自然便有這些事情發生，同時也將發生些旁的使男子們皆顯得可憐可笑的事情。　　她明白這些，她却不表示意見。　　她仍然超越於人類痴妄以上，又快樂又健康的打發每個日子。　　她歡喜散步，海浜潮落後，露出一塊赭色砂灘，齊平如菌褥，比菌褥復更柔和。脚所踐履處，皆起微凹，分明地印出脚掌或鞋跟美麗痕跡。這沙灘常常便印上了一行她的踪跡。許多年靑學生，在無數脚迹中皆辨識得出這種特别脚跡，一顆心追數着留在那砂上那東西，直至潮水來到，洗去了那東西時，方能離開。　　每天潮水的來去，又正似乎是特别爲洗去那砂上其他縱横凌亂的踐履記號，讓這女孩子脚迹最先印到這最砂上。　　海邊的潮水漲落因月而異。有時恰在中午夜半，有時又恰在天明黄昏。有一天，日頭尙未從海中升起，潮水已縮，淡白微靑的天空，還嵌了疏疏的幾顆白星，海邊小山皆還包裏在銀紅色曉霧襄，大有睡欲未醒的樣子。沿海小小散步石道上，矗立在輕霚中的電燈白柱，尙有燈光如星子，蒼白着臉兒。　　她照常穿了那身輕便的衣服，披了一件薄絨背心，持了一條白竹鞭子，鑽出了帳幕，走向海邊去。晨光熹微中大海那麽温柔，一切萬物皆那麽温柔，她飽飽的吸了幾口海上的空氣，便起始沿了尙有濕光與隨處還留着綠色海藻的長灘，向日頭出處的東方走去。　　她輕輕的嘯着，因爲海也正在輕的嘯着。她又輕輕的唱着，因爲海邊山脚豆田裏，有初醒的雀鳥也正在輕輕的唱着。　　有些銀色的霧，流動在沿海山上，與大海水面上。　　這些美麗的東西會不會到人的心頭上？</p>

<p>刊每逢星期一日出版第三七期論統制糧食端生　　上週（八月二十一日）行政院長汪先生在國府紀念週上，鑒於麥價低落，積滞不動，要統制糧食，以期挽回糧價之頽勢；翌日行政院第一二一次會議，又議决於一星期内調查國内產麥滞銷情形，以便設法補救。政府當局能這樣「劍及屨及」的注重民生，爲農民謀福利，値得欽仰。但是在我國現狀之下，無論是統制經濟横生，卽是受人牽掣。當然，要求建設，不應以有阻礙牽掣，竟束手待斃，任人破壞，亦不應以環境如此，而甘心因循，不思改造，卽如要調整農產物價，解决民生問題，自非加以相當的統制不爲功。故明知其施行困難，亦應從困難中求辦法。　　怎樣去統制，這問題複雜了。不經過相當的準備是無從進行的。卽有了相當準備，而無深切了解這事實的内容，亦格格不能行。卽了解面施行不得其道，亦不濟事。何况現在是世界經濟時代，一動百動，不容我閉關自守，所以要統制國内的糧食，還要兼顧國外糧食的產銷變遷！　　卽就此次本麥跌價及積滞不消的說，固不無有奸商操縱其間。但奸商何以能操縱，要知物價的涨落，大槪不出供求律及貨幣盈虚的關係，奸商可能操縱的麽？當然無此能力。然則奸商之所能者，亦不過巧逢時機，因勢乘利，操其所操縱其所縱而己。如無可操可縱之機會，自無操縱之能事。且境在中國的商人，實在可以說，没有甚麽大的操縱能力。上海交易所市塲，儘有大商人要去操縱，結果如其是「逆天而行」，也終歸於失敗的。因此我們要明白奸商之所以能操縱或能居奇者，非其本身自然的力量；明白他所以能操縱能居奇之原因所在，不難使其無操縱無居奇之可能了。其次要明白這次積滞不銷的原因何在？旣經跌了價，爲什麽仍不能銷？是否農人嫌賤不肯賣，商人嫌貴不肯買？那末，現在的市價在貨眞價實的條件之下，究竟爲貴？抑爲賤？假使現在的小麥照現在的價錢，雖則己在生產成本之下，而與其他的小麥較，尙算是相宜的行市，則欲提高價格，該用何種的方法。再則商人遇賤價尙不肯收買，是否爲豐收防市價續跌的緣故，抑爲貨色惡劣不堪行銷的緣故，或者另有足使本麥再行跌價之可能的緣故。有一於是應該如何去消滅這種因，使商人無所懐疑地進行他的小麥買賣。　　講到這一次小麥跌價，大槪的原因㈠今年較往年爲豐收的緣故。據上海糧商說，本年麥產此往年多一半，大約可供麫粉廠家八個月之用。這種槪括的計算，原不足爲準，但豐收總是事實了。卽照此計算，廠家還缺少四個月的小麥，要靠洋麥接濟。結果旣是供不應求，那未麥價何以會一跌再跌呢？這是商人的心理作用。商人之目的爲牟利，牟利當然捒有利可圖無害可加之地方進行。今聞小麥豐收，生怕續跌，遭受損失，因此生戒，不敢多進。大槪商人心理，越跌越要賣，越漲越要買，這是慣見的。㈡還是受了棉麥借欵的影響，固然，此次所惜的棉麥，不過由現欵交易而變爲信用賒貸，其數量照每年棉麥入口數看來，不致有使國内出產的棉麥有停滞之虞。可是忘却了一點，卽「時」的關係。一則逢着比較豐收的年歲，二則不先不後，借欵適成立於新麥正在上市的時候。麥價本有搖動的可能，經此一番，雪上加霜，市氣更虚，市價乃一瀉而下，跌去一元之鉅，自有此猛烈之跌風，商人又時以一千二百餘萬布塞爾小麥抵埠之後，市價不知變動至如何地步爲念，因此對於本麥抱得過且過的宗旨，而意存觀望。㈢受世界小麥豐收及傾銷的影響。自有去年世界小麥豐收各國爲保護本國農產，一面高築壁壘，防外麥之侵入，一面有餘之國家，還是竭力地向外傾銷。最便於傾銷的國家，莫如中國，門户洞開，出入自由，不論那一國，亦不論爲農產，爲工業，俱可向中國漫山塞地而來。好在中國商人，祇顧目前之利，不計後日之害，飽受帝國主義之經濟侵略，民族經濟性早已消失殆盡。因之來者不拒，多多益善，容天下難容之量，足見我國人的大度寛宏了。惟此後的局面或許改易。一則美國自通貨膨脹以來，芝加哥麥價，七月初與三月初較，已高起百分之一百十二。再則美國今年旱，麥收歉折。已成事實。三則倫敦小麥會議已告成功。據八月二十五日路透社倫敦電，已成立協定。其條件爲（一）輸出國允在一九三三至四年輸出至高總額以五萬六千萬布塞爾爲限；（二）除蘇俄與多腦河諸國外，輸出國將於一九三四至三五年减少產額百分之十五，（三）輸入國允於小麥價每百公斤售十二瑞士金法郎，或每布塞爾售金元六角三分六時，（指在目的地碼頭交貨者而言）修正關稅，同時允不利用輸出國額量自動减少之機會，而發展國内之產業。參加者有三十一國。自此協定成立以後麥價將有相當之堅定，本麥自亦受其利益。爲洋粉傾銷的影響。上海一帶粉廠，所用之麥，江北爲多，所銷之粉，天津爲衆，不料外國人見洋麥傾銷，中國人還有人工可沾光，爽性用洋粉傾銷，則除了幾個中國居間商人有好處外，此外一無所有，因此天津地方，日本粉，蘇俄粉，澳洲粉···充斥市塲，中國粉倒是退避三舍。上海廠粉去路旣狹，小麥的需要自减。此外尙有一特殊原因。旣每年新麥上市之候，廠家多買存若干陳麥，備與新麥栟和製粉之用。據聞本年所預備的有兩個月用量之巨，對於新麥的胃口不覺更爲呆鈍了。其㈤因有洋粉傾銷之影響，粉價逐步下游，每包（四十九磅）跌至二元一角左右。如以三元五六角的小麥出粉七十一二斤計算，廠商尙以爲無利可圖。假如麥價提高，粉價不能提高，恐怕機車停工，還要增加，洋粉進口，更爲披猖了。　　以上所云麥價跌落之原因，亦不過陳其槪要；當然，市價變遷之因果正多，不能縷述。就其大端可知之因，以尋其果，循果以索方，則我們應如何去統制小麥，維護農民的經濟。　　自然，最要緊的是統制麥價。可是政府的力量遇高價抑之使低，不難用政令權力去限制之。至欲將低的物價提之使高，非有實力不可。最好是政府能參用古代常平的辦法，遇賤則　，遇貴則糶，於中調節，使其賤不傷農，貴不害民。或者是由農民銀行，農業倉庫，或如鄕間之典當，由政府　通以資金，並爲之保障，使其盡量接受如小麥等類之抵押，俾紓農民目前之急，而得待時以沽。此數者能否可行，要在政府之有無决心。其他如提高關稅，禁止進口，或所益甚微，或在中國現狀之下，尙不能行。此外如限制廠家少用洋麥，多用本麥，則亦未始不可。大抵粉廠所用洋麥本麥之比例，洋四本六，本年小麥經過精密之調查，確可供給，則不妨限制廠家用麥，爲洋三本七，洋二本八，亦無不可。　　不過，要明白本麥雖屬豐收，並非過剩，猶患不給。再則商家非無需要，不過因一時的影響，深其顧慮；加以粉銷不振，存麥尙富，目前暫無大宗需要。故患的是積食成驚伏邪未淸，如得退食消驚，而無外感侵襲，本麥卽可起死回生。　　消食是不成問題的，運化不停，積滞自會消滅，此不過時間問題。退驚亦不難，此次麥價之狂跌，及商人之觀望，還是棉麥借欵的影響居多。政府應該明白地向商人說，本麥尙未有相當銷納之前，政府所辦的洋麥决不上市，一面與糧食商人開誠布公共籌出售辦法，以無害於民食，無損於農民，無不利於工商業之條件下處置之，政府果能如此處置，商人旣明白政府之態度，無所庸其驚疑，自敢放手採辦了。好在棉來辦事處已成立，宋部長卽日回國，想不久當有分曉了。　　食已銷，驚已退，最難治的仍爲去伏邪，退外感，蓋在在有侵害本原之可能。所謂伏邪外感者，卽洋　洋麥無限制之進口是也。如果禁止進口，目前萬萬所不能做到的。假使依然放任，則又如水銀瀉地無孔不入的進來，不但本麥無銷路，卽粉廠亦要關門。旣不能禁止其不來，其實亦不能完全禁止其進口，尙需他補充供給的地方正多丨那末；祇有限制的一法。限制之道，在目前之吾國，凡是稍有對外關係的事體。卽覺動輒皆非，阻碍横生。求其比較的可行，還以進口粉麥丨不僅粉麥，厲行登記領照販賣制度爲便。卽商人無論向海外定貨，或就己到之貨販賣，均須向某種機關登記，領取護照，方准購買。假使不能提出護照，海關卽不准其上岸，内地卽不准其流通。如認爲商人所購之數量，已超越全國所需要之量或無需外糧接濟時，得停發採買護照。如此，可以收調節之效，自無積食之虞，保育農工，維護商業，在無可辦法之中，或許可爲一辦法也。至此機關如何組織如何運用，如何準備，不在本文範圍之内，茲不　。　　不過事有嚴重更甚於小麥者，卽米榖是也。自有前年之洋米充斥，去年之秋收大有，本年以來米價，至今不能抬頭，農民咄嗟，　　不繼，朝不保夕的情景，稍行踄足鄕間，便見觸目皆是。轉瞬又屆新糓盡登之候，如不立籌辦法，過了十一二月，政府卽有救濟。農民已難沾實惠，利歸商人地主的了。故如今年新米仍舊不値錢，明年農民勢必困斃，農村復興，更無從談起，此則深望當局從早加之意也。高利貸可取締乎？士浩　　自資金之流動失其常軌，通商大埠游資過剩，内地則銀根枯竭，農村更甚。農民欲求小額之貸金而不可得；間或得之，則利率甚高，輒覺不勝其負袒。論者乃不满於高利貸，以爲農村之貧，貧於資金，資金之　，　於高　，非打倒商利貸，不能收復興農村之效。於是一唱百和，衆言成是。但揆諸學理，考之事實，恐有未必如是。其淺易者，請申其說：　　常考利息之發生，非偶然也，有經濟的原因，爲其基礎。内地資金之外流，興夫利率之高升，非貸金家本意之所欲也，亦有經濟原則，支配於其間。自李嘉圖地租論出，歷來之言利息者，必曰利息爲借用資金之代價。有資金者，不投於生利之途，而貸放於人，無非以貸金亦是利殖也。利息，卽爲其利殖之所得。受貸者不情於償還本金外，益以利息，亦無非以貸金使用，可以生利也，利息，卽爲其利得之一部份。貸金者與借金者間，蓋本以資金之利殖率，决定其借用之代價也。若貸借二方之需供關係，不能相符，供過於求，則利息低，求過於供，則利息高。貸金者莫不求利息之高，故設另有一金融市塲利息較高，資金必流去，直至原金融市塲之資金，不敷需要，其利息與他金融市場爲同一之抬高，方行停止。反之，此金融市場之利息，高於他處，則資金亦必内流，以抑其利息至與他處相平。此利率漲落之原則，亦卽資金流動之原則也。至於利息之發生，雖　利殖的運用爲例，然非利殖運用之借金，亦受其支配，此則凡治經濟學者，類能道之。　　貸放之資金，非必能如數歸還也，借金者若用之於利殖之途，則有蝕本而倒欠者矣。若以之調劑緩急，則有無法償還者矣。天災人禍不可測，私人經濟之變化，尤多意外。稍一不愼，資金卽不免落空。貸金家之貸放資金，自不免冒若干危險，苟非貪圖利息，孰願爲之。故歷來之言利息者，又曰，利息中含有保險費也。若借金者之危險程度較高，非出重利，無人肯爲貸放。且厚利固人人之所欲，而安全尤貸金者之所注意也。所以資金之流動方向，安全最要。而利之厚薄，尙在其次。安全而得簿利，固勝於冒危險以求厚利也。此理也，凡治經濟學者亦類能道之。　　夫内地固感於銀根之枯緊也，農村固感於資金之貧乏也。然而社會不安，經濟衰落，生利之途旣澀，資金運用之危險自大。借金者縱願負担重利，以求濟乎眉急，其如貸金者不願担冒危險何？若乃通商人埠，社會較安，秩序較佳，且經濟有局部之繁榮，生利之途較廣。如公債，地產，之買賣，金銀及一般商品之投機若干資本家及商人等，正視爲利厚可靠，銀行途不情　高利率，吸收資金。近來銀行長期存欵，利率常爲一分或一分以上，農村利息雖在二分以上，以内地與　商大埠較，安全違不如之，此資金所以仍源源外流也。且内地社會不安，產業頽廢進出貿易，收不抵付，外來資金，遂有减而無增。加以　室之外遷，捐稅之搜括，又在在足以驅逐資金。資金外流，乃不期而如水之歸　。資金旣外流，内地相互間之貸借，愈供不應求。社會之不安，亦日甚，於是利息隨之而高漲，甚至願出高利，而稱貸無門者。依經濟之原則言，資金溢，則减低利率，輸其游資於外。資金缺，則增高利率，以吸收外資。就内地資金之貧乏現象，以爲觀察，惟增高利息，或足以調劑之。而論者乃高唱取締高利貸，是益將騙逐資金也，復興農村，果若是乎？　　然則高利貸竟有益於農村乎？是又不然。凡利息高，則借金者受貸金者之剥削深，日卽於窮困，貸金者則以利厚，而流於奢侈，二者均足以阻碍民生經濟。爲今之計，能設法劑之於平，方爲正辦，固不必高唱取締。經濟學者有恒言曰，經濟事情，當以經濟政策支配之。高利，經濟事情也；取締，官力也；平利之道，蓋自有經濟政策在焉。各國之有力的中央銀行，每遇市面銀根緊，利息高漲，則首先减低利率，擴張放欵。此平利經濟政策之一法也。今春美國之金融風潮，亦賴政府擴充信用，而得平落。竊以爲居今而言調劑農村資金，其最捷之法，莫此若也。然此非規模遠大者不可。吾國金融業，果有此毅力乎？政府能作此後盾乎？如其不能，空談取締高利貸奚爲也。　　且借貸，僅足以濟緩急者也。農村經濟，旣非短時期所能恢復。縱能爲大規模的調劑，而以產業不興，猶注水漏巵，儻來卽去，資金依然缺乏，高利何能平抑，故惟改造農村，施行大規模的，與機器的生產制，俾復興二字，從根本做起。前著「復興農村問題管見」中言之詳矣。農村生產事業旣發達，貿易上之虧空可免，生活安定可覩，貸金之危險旣小，高利亦不待取締而自落。且不僅此也，產業旣興，社會旣安，信用制度，亦可起色，交易往來，有不待現欵者矣。欵項之需用旣少，銀根自寛，利息自平。近之論家，亦有提倡信用合作者矣，然農產事業之根本弱點未除，農民正困乏本，何能長保其信用。故曰，居今而言平利之法，莫根本改造農村若也。救濟農村經濟之商榷王維駟　　農村經濟之衰落，不僅爲農民本身利害及國民經濟之消長問題，實爲整個民族之安危興亡所繫。吾國農民佔全體民衆之絕對多數，以絕對多數之民衆，陷於經濟恐慌不克自救之地位，無異人身血枯力竭，元氣大損，寗有不陷於危險之境者。故以目前局勢論，救濟農村經濟，卽係救國救亡之道。但欲救濟農村經濟，必先明農村所以破產之原因。茲　其因之可得言者，則　　㈠外國產業之發達；自機械生產之運用自如，各資本主義國家生產過剩，不得不低價運銷於產業落後之中國。並因國外運輸比内地運輸便利而省費，於是國内市塲充满外來工業口及農產品，本國土貨反無由銷售，農村經濟遂根本搖動。㈡國内機械工業之興起；目下國内各大都市機械工業漸漸興起，與外國工業品互相競爭於市塲，農民手工業，全被淘汰。　　㈢小資產階級之剥削；内地小資產階級發見農村經濟之動搖，鄕村方面投資，毫無把握，乃紛紛以自農民剥削而來之現金，向都市投資或經營他　事業。農村之現金，間接向都市集中，農民生產資本，無法周轉，生產量亦隨之減少，農村經濟，更形枯竭。㈣歷年災禍之影響；加以水旱兵災，無年不有，正如衰頽之老人，連遭風寒之侵襲，農村經濟乃陷於萬刦不復之境。㈤農民守舊心理過於濃厚；不肯接受新智識，不能適應現代之環境，兼以無組織無團結，一切公益事益，均莫由興辦。因茲種種，農村經濟之崩潰，乃爲必然之結果。　　農村現金集中都市，又未見投資於各種工商事業，大都以爲買賣公債地產之用，故其所爲益於生產事業者亦微。而在農民則以鄕村金歌枯竭，耕種之資無着，農事歸於停頓。今欲以都市不生產之資金，調劑瀕於破產之農村，自非少許人所能濟事，而負此項重大之使命者，舍銀行界其莫屬也。　　查歐美諸國銀行事業無不與國内農工商業之發生及發展有連帶關係。蓋先有發達之農工商業，然後能發展銀行業務，同時銀行業務之發展，亦可促農工商業之進步，銀行業有補助調劑農工商業之責任，而補助與調劑農工商事，亦卽所以促進銀行本身業務之發展，雙方有互助之關係也。吾國近數十年來，新設銀行，風起雲湧，金融事業：不可謂不發達。然而工商業之幼稚凋疲如故，足見銀行業與工商業尙未能發生密切之關係。尤其是農村方面，旣無銀行之設立，農民對於銀行業務之性質，亦茫然不悉。且以農村經濟早陷於破產地位，銀行方面農村投資，爲鄭重其本身業務計，亦非獲有世實可靠之保證，未便貿然進行。故目下雙方尙未能發生深切關係，亦自有其客觀之社會關係在。惟年來吾國受世界經濟不景氣影響，　　　　業衰落，全國民衆，已普遍的陷於貧乏狀態中。銀行之原有基礎，不免稍受影響。具有遠見之銀行家，亦在亟亟於别求出踏。以我國情况而論，社會組織旣以，農村爲主體，生產事業亦以農業爲大宗，又正上下一致討論救濟農村經濟，企盼金融界予以經濟上之援助。而最近滬埠銀行界已有農村金融調劑委員會之籌設，其已决心投資，调劑農村，殆無義議。惟在銀行界調劑農村經濟其最要點，卽在如何可以謀投資安全之保障。所謂安全保障者，卽資金流入農村後，農民能絕對維持信用，運用穩妥，使投資者或熱心農村事業者不致視爲長途，借用不致中斷。若是則投資旣有保障，不特可以維持銀行本身業務之安全，抑且可以引起其他熱心救濟農村經濟者之共同參加，資金之流入農村自易普遍也。茲就銀行界調劑農村經濟之辦法；一加研究也。　　㈠組織聨合農村貸欵機關銀行對於調劑農村金融，究應通力合作，抑宜各自爲政，不妨先加以討論。鄙意以爲現在各銀行除農民銀行外，對於調劑農村金融，祇能出其餘国力，因銀行各有其主要業務在，自難以全力經營，而况此種事業，非集有巨厚之財力不可，决非一二銀行之力所能收效，故上海銀行界似應卽聨合組織貸欵機關。其投資方法，不妨各盡其力，或按照銀行内容攤派資金，祇以不妨礙其本身基礎爲原則，設有处願增加，自屬多多益善。貸欵事務，可另行組織聨合農村總分機關辦理之，將來利益損失，卽照各行投資額比率分配。此種辦法集欵旣易，對於投資銀行本身，亦無危險，蓋卽使一旦不幸，放欵全行呆滞，或竟不能收回，亦因投資之時，係量力分派，自不致影響其主要業務。况事實上辦理得法，决不至此。至此舉於銀行方面，實有不少之利益。蓋自一二八以後，滬上現金集中，銀行存欵因商業衰落，往往不能充分運用，藉此可將過剩資金加以活動。故銀行聨合組織貸欵機關，可謂有利無弊之調劑農村金融方法。　　㈡舉辦農產押欵去今兩歲，米價大跌，農民所產，無一不廉，欲待時機以得善價，若於索債催賦，相逼而來，日常生活，需用孔股，祇得忍痛脫售，聊濟眉急。以此而所蒙損失，亦至浩大。吾上海銀行界苟能注意於内地之產米區域，尤其於鄕村方面（農產押欵，原非以米爲限，惟江南一帶，農產以米爲大宗，用以舉例）設立倉庫。其已設銀行之處，卽由該銀行辦理，未設者最好由各行會同集資設立臨時辦事處，或委託當地公正士紳，組織積榖倉庫。農民如遇米榖價格暴跌，不願卽時出售，而又待欵急切，可以抵押借欵。此項借欵，旣有農產品抵押，可謂毫無危險。在農民得此押欵，無庸將米糧低價出售，可免種種損失，市面農產品减少，價格自能高漲，物價提高之收入，仍舊農民。至在銀行方面，借此可得可靠放欵之機會，不失調劑農村金融之旨，亦一舉兩得之事。　　銀行界調劑農村金融方法最急者，卽上述二點。然吾人須知阻礙農村之復興者，原因非止一端，外則帝國主義者侵略，内則軍閥土匪土豪劣紳壓迫及剥削，交通不便利，敎育不普及，苛捐雜稅未除，政治未上正軌，均爲農村經濟之致命傷，銀行調劑農村金融，祇能免除農民受高利貸之剥削，而不能免除其他更甚之苛捐雜稅等，可知救濟農村經濟，决非徒恃銀行界金融调劑所能濟事，而有待於政府者正多。所期望最切者，厥爲：㈠發展交通，廢除苛捐雜稅；我國幅員遼闊，交通不便，商品運輸，已感困難。加以邊遠各省，軍閥割據，省自爲政，横征暴歛，誅求無饜，故往往農產物品，由甲省運至乙省，因運費高昂，稅捐頻繁，其價格遠較涉重洋而來之同種洋貨爲高，因之不易銷售，市塲全爲洋貨所侵奪。甚至各地商品，莫由流通，一則供過於求，物價驟落，一則生産缺乏，供不應求，亦有此則粒米狼藉，彼則餓莩載道。可知運輸交通之阻隔，實足加重農民之困難。政府應於剿匪之外，廢除苛稅，積極經營鄕村與都市間交通事宜，聨絡一氣，則農產品運輸便利，消息　通，自不致各地農產品供求不相適應矣。　　㈡提倡鄕村敎育　吾國學校及一切文化事業，大都設立於城市間，至鄕村僻地，除江浙等省，尙間有小學校之設立外，至其他各省離普及也遠甚，一般農民無論國家大小，社會情况，以及農事常識，均茫然莫悉，無怪其任人宰割，而農村中一切事業，均操之於少數人之手。吾國農村經濟之破產，可謂農民智識愚陋不能爲自助互助之組織有以致之，爲今之計，普及鄕村敎育，以增進農民之智識，亦屬切要之圖。政府應卽指撥的欵，於各省鄕村創辦平民學校，予農民以免費入學之機會。依環境之需要，添辦農科附設農村指導所，從事農業之研究及指導。對於附近農民，多加聨絡，幷分别派人向農民集合地點演講，使無能入學及不識字者亦可獲得相當智識。鄕村學校四周之田園，亦卽爲學校之農事試騐塲，最好劃出一部份試騐塲爲模範農田，用最新方法耕作而獲得豐盛之收穫，使一般農民對於科學方法發生信仰，羣相效法。此外則關於公民敎育，亦屬需要。如公民常識之灌輸，鄕村自治之建設，保衛團或合作社等之組織，均有賴於公民敎育之指導及訓練，務使各農民能化除自私自利之見，團體一致，以求國家社會基礎之鞏固。尙有一點，應由農民自行努力，而政府及金融機關，如以指導及扶助者，則爲組織農村信用合作社丨丨信用合作者，係合資經營信用放欵，供給農民生產上所必需資本之組織。合作社之需要，盡人知之。惟此種組織，非如農民銀行所需資本甚大，地方農民易於舉辦，故此時政府及金融界應予以有力之協助而促成之，幷取締不肖鄕長等，藉合作之名義，利用無知農民，操縱社内事務，以圖私人利益。農民借欵，應加以正當之限制。總以種子肥料育蠶蓄牧及其他以生產爲目的之資本爲限，如發現借欵農民用途不合或不正當之用途時，可徴收相當罰金，幷酌量停止其借欵權，務使借出欵項，均在促進農事上信用合作，除謀農業金融之調劑外，應兼營生產儲藏運銷利用等業務，以充實内容健全組織，同時對於當地農村經濟，詳加調查，根據調查結果，提倡相當之農村副業，如養蠶養鷄養羊等等。　　上述各節，雖屬平淡無奇，苟能獲政府當局及金融界領袖之注意，因而見諸實施，則嘉，崽農民，殊非淺鮮矣。本刋啟事　　本刋承讀者愛護鴻著巨製時荷惠投限於　幅未能盡載爲歉至文稿一經登載酌致酬金以答雅誼如蒙轉載固所榮幸但請註明「轉載申報經濟專刋」以重法益所有本刋文責仍由作者自負諸希　　公鑒金融星期拆市平庸　　昨日又逢例有之星期、銀行方面完全休業、卽市塲中拆息價亦無絲毫上落、早午同開六分、拆票交易早市轉帳四百七十餘萬、新交易六七十萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、銀行收解亦以休業而停頓、錢莊洋公單收解二千五百餘萬、各路滙欵三十餘萬、洋押欵及洋劃頭欵均無收解可紀、輔幣亦平穩愈常、江角早午市爲八百四十四元、交易早市四千角、午市一千五百角、廣角早市爲七百八十元零八角、午市爲七百八十一元三角、交易早市六萬五千角、午市三萬五千角、鋼元仍爲三百十六千文、而交易甚少、不及一萬元之代價、洋僅九千八百元、爲三萬零九百餘串文、　　早　　午　　洋拆　　六分　　六分江南　八百四十四元　八百四十四元廣東　七百八十元零八角　　七百八十一元三角拆兌　　一千二百八十角七　一千二百七十九角九銅元　三百十六千文　　三百十六千文衣牌　三千一百六十文　三千一百六十文角坯　　二百四十七文　　二百四十七文貼水　六十九文　六十九文證劵上週債市絕少風波　　上週八月二十一至二十六日、華商證券交易所、爲八月份期貨買賣最後之一週、在以前向例、必有一番軋多軋空之熱閙市面、而上週無互相傾軋之象、且市面非常呆滞、大都爲盤旋平定狀况、爲交割相近時、數月來未有之特殊現象、蓋以環境沉悶、市上自前次四十六號有鉅量數額賣出後、原有空頭、已得有相當出路、而四十六號放出之貨、絕對不補、是以多方頓見擁擠、故上週經過、市價疲莫能興、但以多頭祇掉期、幷無慌張之出籠、是以疲軟而平定、交易亦幷不因改做三盤而遽有起色、週一卽係盤旋、高低在二角左右、週二多頭卽有掉期價呆滞帶疲、比較微小三四角、週三九六忽又有整理之謠、雖謠言去事實尙遠、市上空頭、不無稍見恐慌、故因九六之驟起漲風、其餘各種、亦均爲之帶好三四角左右、週四九六謠言無從證實、各種仍因多頭掉期隨九六而回跌、週五續小二三角、九六又回好四五角、週六又見混沌、高低互見、爲數亦祇二三角而已、全週結果、計跌去一二角至四五角、祇廿關本月跌九角爲最多、而一八關一九關尙微漲一角至三角半、九六則漲起八九角、因謠言而有波瀾、餘無足述、成交總數、計共五千五百八十五萬七千元、内現貨佔二萬二千元、期貨以九六一種佔最多數、共計成交一千零二十在萬五千元、統鹽稅兩共一千六百零六萬五千、裁兵佔五百零四萬五千、一九關善兩共七百十八萬、廿捲廿關兩共八百五十六萬、編遣整六共六百三十二萬、餘則二三十萬至六七十萬不等、紗花美棉抵空回堅　　昨日美棉先因外商買進而漲、繼以南方套賣而跌、終因一部分空頭抵補回堅、結果現貨漲五磅音、期貨略漲一二磅音、利物浦棉市現貨漲十四點、期貨漲六七點、埃及棉貨漲十二點、孟買棉市因歐洲出口商買進、空頭抵補、投機家買進而漲、結果平加爾奥姆辣均漲二羅比七角半、白羅溪漲三羅比二角半、原電錄左、（二十六日電）　　美

<p>談言乞丐們  因　　在我看LheNewChinese的時候，裏面有這樣的幾句話"lfonewishes：tohelprsggedbeggsrsthstsbsdwsytodoit"　　有一般人是這樣的主張着：白鬚老翁，蒼髮婆婆，是應該施救的，此外什麽壯年男女，童年孩子，一槪不能施救，其理由是因爲老年的時候，精力旣已衰疲，而又身無長物，可賴以爲生，我們終不能「袖手視其待斃」，所以應該帮助的，此外壯男童孩等若輕易地予以經濟上的帮助，非但補救目前而遺害於其終身者殊非淺鮮。　　在本鄕也有兩句關係乞丐的諺語：『三年飯討過，官都不要做，』「救急好救，救窮難救」，前者是說因作乞丐可無憂慮對於衣食住行，更不用操心費力，而能了此一生的安閑生活；後者是說没有相當職業者是難以救劑的。　　我也十分的不了解，眞的因乞丐生活是安閒的。還是社會的情形，實在太矛盾和畸形的緣故，自「九一八」，「一二八以後不知增加了幾多倍的沿路乞，在馬路盡頭的或是電車站旁，就有年紀很幼的小呌化子迎面向你磕頭跪拜，什麽都做得出，他們要求的代價是一個「銅板」，實在怪討厭的，眞是所謂强呌化子，你若不給他一個「銅板」，他會繼續地跟着你，滔滔不絕懇求你，最後假使吝而不給，他必報你，一個鬼臉，接着便是輕微聲音的毒駡，在他們的心理上以爲遇見了呌化子，算盡一個「銅板」的義務不可的。　　在虹口尤其是在夏之夜，沿路和弄堂裏睡起足了「呌化子」「徒手流氓」，有時我看見或聽見管房子的把這些呌化子强迫走丨其實這也不是個根本辦法呀！這裏趕走了跑到了那邊，對於呌化子的數量上何曾有些减少呢？　　站在資產階級的立塲上，是布爾其區的一員，當然可以說：「乞丐上不可救劑的，輕易地救劑，反養成了他們更懶惰的習慣」，但是站在同一階級，同一觀點上的我們，旣不忍處旁觀態度，又無力開設工廠而容納而這據這大量的呌化子，這便是今日社會上這樣不安寗的原因呀！關於「談窮」  乾序　　看見了因先生的「談窮」，我不禁想起了我的朋友樹的事情：　　樹是一個有爲的靑年，具有满腔的熱情和前進的意志，但是在中學畢業了以後，因了家庭經濟的艱窘，使他不能不抑遏了入最高學府求高深學識的念頭，而去甘願愛生活的鞭策。　　具有了中等學識的出路，不一定會比一個未受敎育的孩子容易找得的。可是樹例外，當他已經决定出賣他的勢力以求安定他家庭的生活時，不久就得了一個機會，到京都進ＸＸ部去當了一個小辦事員，果然他的家庭可以勉强敷衍下去了。在星期假日玄武湖泛舟裏他告訴我時還帶了一點安慰的顏色。　　但是在「一二八」國難以後，國府因爲經費支絀而大裁其員，在這高唱「節流」的怒湖之下，而小辦事員當然是首當其衝，於是樹便也不幸而「另待任用」了。　　去年的秋天，我在南京遇到了他丨樹，我們便又在玄武湖内蕩漾了。但樹的臉上的顏色，已是憂鬱而非安慰。满腔的熱情冷了麽？前進的意志餒了麽？我聽了他的言語後内心狐疑着。但是我能帮助他點什麽呢？我自顧尙不暇！　　最近從别的朋友裏轉輾傳來的消息；樹已是不勝經濟的負擔而葬身洪流了！在燕子磯頭「死不得」的木牌之前！　　因了因先生而勾起我的舊感，同時發生了一點疑問：生活眞能因進過「窮」的境界而「充實」嗎？一眞窮到底便怎麽樣？看透了「這個世界的病症」又怎麽樣？剌激深了祇覺着痛苦，空言與理想是無補於事實的。　　我不否認我的朋友樹是一個弱者，但是我也不反對「搶」和「偷」，我以爲「搶」和「偷」是人的本能，我的朋友他如果肯「搶」和「偷」的話，便不至於甘心作弱者了。　　「搶」和「偷」眞的像因先生說的那樣「可羞」而「没出息」嗎？那我要請你們解釋「竊國者侯竊鈎者誅」這八個大字。我希望立言要不離於事實。發財之道  邨人　　自從漢朝丨光武時代丨確定了以儒敎爲聖人之道統治人民以來，孔子被崇拜爲至聖先師，其言行被奉爲金科玉律，一般腐儒學者便以孔子所說的，「富而可求，雖執鞭之士吾亦爲之，」這一句聖人之言作爲鄙視金錢以自高的招牌，甚至目金錢爲阿賭物，駡富人爲財奴，這實在是食古不化的蠢才！　　現在的人就聰明啦，孔子的言行，和别人說話的時候是用的，可是所說的話只限於别人去實行，自己却是例外。對於金錢這方面也是一樣，口裏儘管呌别人廉潔淸高，自己却多多益善。而且發財之道，也實在超過了聖人的大聰明，假令孔子有知，也要佩服到五體投地。　　誨人不倦的敎育事業，在聖人是不懂得可以發財的，而現在的敎育家的辦學，是召集資本開辦識字製造廠以發財，其利潤之大，使一個窮光蛋可以有洋房汽車嬌妻美妾（現在新名詞是愛人），而且能夠出洋游歷各國。　　爲國爲民的政治行爲，在聖人也是不　得可以發財的，而現在的政治家上台不過幾十個月，洋房汽車嬌妻美妾之外，還有地皮以至於巍峨一座的銀行。　　提起救國發財的更多啦，名正言順的有本來就在希求發財的商人的國貨救國發財；改頭換面的東洋貨救國發財；此外，買航空獎劵救國發財，抗日救國發財，募捐救國發財，代收捐欵救國發財······名目繁多，不勝枚舉。明日的新聞  曉人　　　　歐美各國爲中國下野之軍人與政客出洋便利起見，特組織一輪船公司於上海，有考察號，及游歷號巨輪二艘。設備之精，規模之大，嘆爲未有。聞該公司並聘有德國醫學專家，及打包專家數人，以備乘客臨行前戒除嗜好及打包巨額行李之需。　　中國軍隊悉數改爲大刀隊，並另添長矛，飛鏣，等隊全國各鐵路店利市三倍。　　全國縮食購機，飛機多於汽車，汽車夫改業飛機師。　　某幼稚園，因校長私吃奶油花生糖五塊，發生罷課風潮，驅逐校長，幷且宣布其食品不公開，玩具太少等十大罪狀。　　播影收音機風行全國，各播音　兼播影片，影戲院絕跡。　　各百貨商店，無價不廉，無售不賤，例如超摩登華麗堅韌紙質旗袍料，每元五十三件，冲鋼機件上等泥壳最趨時檯鐘。每架一角九分九等等，貨色繁多，不克備載。　　銀行自辦小額信用借欵以來，社會受惠匪淺，而一般超摩登婦女對於時裝及脂粉等費。不致使丈夫爲難，尤稱便不置。　　上海各烟紙店皆設有儲蓄部，大洋一角，即可立摺，兼備禮劵，自數百文起，至數百元止，草紙，香烟，芝麻醬油等，日常必須品，並可兌現。社會經濟富裕，居民夜不閉户。從黄包車夫得到的啓示  藻　　雖說是交了秋，然而在晚上天氣還是這樣的悶熱。照已往一般天時的情形，立秋過後，即使悶熱，也不過是在中</p>

<p>午的一刹那，早晚總是凉風習習的。　　在南市友人的家裏，吃了晚飯以後，就大家坐在天井中談天。天氣是悶熱着；一些兒風也没有吹來，每個人身上的汗，好像如珠設的流下來。空間的電光，不斷的在閃爍。悶熱，還是這樣的悶熱，幾乎悶得使每個人窒息。　　忽然，呼呼地一陣陣的劇風起來了，玻璃的門窗都被吹碰得互相兵乓作響。繼着還有霹靂的雷聲，大地上的悶熱，已消去了一半，蔣窒息的人們，也淸醒了許多。『山雨欲來風满樓』，這是大雨將來的先兆。我是住在虹口的，乘雨尙未到來的時候，還是早些跑吧，我想。就告别了友人出來。　　馬路上的情景，都呈現着緊張的狀態；人們都很緊急地奔跑着，兩傍店舗裏的夥友們，紛紛的把招牌取下，有的甚至於上起牌門板來。　　爲了想早一些到家，在十六舗坐上了黄包車向前跑。風是越大了，馬路上的灰沙，都被它捲了起來。我們是逆風進行着，眼睛幾乎不能睜開，口裏也早已送進了灰沙。車夫警告我頭上草帽當心被風刮去，我囑他眼睛不要被灰沙吹入。那時候，馬路上除了稀然的電車來往外，祇有我們一輛黄包車獨自推進着。電光是不停的閃爍。接着就是破竹般的协聲，銅元大的兩點，也打到我身上來了。恐怖的情緒，忽然在我的心裏湧了起來；在這樣大的雷雨下，行人是很容易觸電的。這樣想，心境愈是戰憟。　　『我們到就近弄堂裏去停一會，待雨小一些時再拉吧。』我向車夫要求了。　　『不必停，可以拉的』。他簡捷的回答我。　　『這樣大的雨很難拉。並且雨對面打來，我很難受，還是停一會吧』。我繼續要求他停車。　　『别怕丨先生，在這樣天拉車，我們是常拉的。不要緊的。你如果怕雨打的話，把油布遮在面部就得啦。』他發出很沉重的聲音，埋着頭依舊向着逆風雨前進。　　縮在車裏的我，聽了他的話以後，恐怖戰傈的心裏，增加了許多勇氣。面部也决定不用油布遮了，眼見他在雨點被暴風捲成濃厚的白霧中，電光從雲間閃出一條條的曲線下，莊嚴地，勇敢地一步一步的和向前進行。　　到家裏，風是停止了；雨也變成微微的細絲了，祇有天空際的電光，還是在閃爍着。當我付車資給他的時候，他露出了勝利的微笑向我說：『先生，如果我中途停止了，現在就能達到這裏的目的地嗎？』　　『現在說不定還尙在途中徬徨呢』。我顯示出慚愧的神色回答他。店員通訊仁慈的廠主？　　編者先生：　　在平日申報上受你間接敎導之下，今天我也來麻煩你一次的淸思，以圖個解决。　　事實是如次的：我的兄弟失業了一年多，好容易利用一個機會，被介紹給某廠主，担任家庭敎師的職務。薪水是屬於津貼性質，當然不能在水平以上：本來這種位置，王這　主本是無　　　，所以如此，完全是出於廠主憐務　失業靑年痛苦起見的「博施於民，而能濟衆」的仁心，在舍弟只圖現今有一枝之棲，不計其他；又何况仁愛的廠主，面許。「俟有機緣，徐圖進展」的好希望呢？所以舍弟惟有忠誠服務，來報答某廠主的體　和仁慈心。　　舍弟有讀書癖，在這廠主書房裏，　　除掉敎讀之外，還時常翻閱他主人的書籍，幷且踱步參觀他主人的化學樣品。在平人看來，這不過是一個人的求知慾和好奇心罷了；誰知不明理的廠主家人，就借此進讒於廠主。因此，舍弟頭上，就有一頂「偷東西」的寃枉帽子戴上了；平日親近的主人，一變而抱不满了。於是位置也發生了動搖，將至於解雇。　　只要我們「光明磊落」「没有病不會死人的，」誰知好愛面子的舍弟，悲憤交集，痛不欲生。憑你們怎樣勸解，都歸無效；幷且在他身邊，床頭，發現了兩三次的毒藥。這很明顯的，他將以生命來同他的名譽一道去，的准備。問題旣擴大，日夜只守着一個人的自殺，也不是辦法；所以請學深見廣的先生，想個辦法；忘樣能收復舍弟的名譽，挽救他的短見？　　再某廠主家，幷未遺失任何物品，况他室中，除有許多舊書和化學藥瓶之外，就是紅木桌椅。在此附帶聲明。　　編者先生，帮助一個人挽救第二生命的名譽吧！挽救一個靑年自殺吧！祝你　　健康　　　　劉公達　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　編者按：這件事，自始至終，你們昆仲兩位，根本觀察錯誤。你們以爲這廠主是體恤和仁慈的嗎？老實告訴你，天下没有能夠體恤貧民的富人，更没有仁慈的廠主。你們槪　　廠主　　，並未遺失任何物品；而他却硬要借這莫有的口實來解雇，就可以覺悟了。俗話說得好，捉姦捉雙，捉賊捉贓；雖則有人進讒，除非他另有用意，那裏能夠相信呢！　　據我們看來，這廠主一定是一個專會愚弄窮人爲富不仁的東西。他在需要你令弟的時候，却不肯直捷爽快地說出來，偏要裝出一副假仁假義的樣子，說什麽「這位置本是無意設置」，以及面許「俟有機緣，徐圖進展」等話。凡此種種，都是他的手段，所以然者，不過使令弟在極低的報酬之下，能替他忠誠地服務罷了。　　現在他大槪已不需要令弟的工作了，但是因爲要照顧到以前假仁假義的諾言起見，不好意思直捷爽快的解雇。說不定他授意於家人，放出這一種不入耳的流言，使令弟即使到死的時候，嘴裏還會稱他一聲「仁慈的主人」。　　你要我們想一個法子。挽救令弟的短見，我們没有别的法子，祇有請你將以上的話，轉告給他。他或許會拍案覺悟，呌他去死也不肯死了；如其他眞的要死，也得去問一聲廠主，「我偷的是甚麽東西，有没有憑據」？如其没有圓满的答復，可以要他償還名譽。一個人拚了死，還怕他有財有勢嗎？五尺以内，决個死活，倒也痛快。　　寫到這裏我們還要很到誠的勸勸一般有錢的人：你們要剥削窮人，儘管放出眞面目來剥削，好在這世界，原來是一個富人剥削窮人的世界。譬如上面的一位廠主，即使不用手段，難道會因爲報酬微薄而用不到人嗎？難道會因解雇而發生問題嗎？不要賣弄手段，專做這騙　人不償命的把戲！那就造福　窮了　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　現代名人書畫　　何韜晦陳富華二位先生（履略）　　定海何祖蔭先生。號韜晦。工行楷。勁猷挺拔。别具風姿。陳富華先生。公餘臨池。無間寒暑。平生致力於衡方碑。頗得其神髓。此乃二氏合作便面。</p>

<p>電影專刊蘇聨最近的電影業（上）  時春　　蘇聨的電影事業，是五年計畫管理下的敎育工作中的一部分。他們的電影界在政府的領導之下取同一前進的步伐。他們並不利用紳士的高帽子或女子的粉白大腿，向一般人民獻媚。他們也不描寫無限制的奢華來麻痺被壓迫的人民。他們更不替帝國主義者張目。蘇聨的電影主要的目的，是喚醒被壓迫下的民族，使大家覺悟了站到最前缐去决鬥。　　蘇聨是一個被人認爲洪水猛獸的國家。在現在的國際之間，有人想蘇聨不是人類所居住的。帝國主義者對於蘇聨，尤其有談虎色變之感。但是蘇聨自從革命到現在並没有山崩土裂的現象。而且五年計畫的施行，亦未見其成一可怕的國家。一切且比較世界各國都有生氣。五年計畫的内容。和他們的革命眞相，都利用電影作宣傳的工具，使全世界對於蘇聨發生切實的明瞭。這是最近蘇聨利用電影向國外擴展陣缐的最重要的步驟。　　蘇聨向國外擴展後的電影事業已收了很好的效果。以電影事業稱覇於世界的美國，對於蘇的電影，亦有極好的感念。當蘇聨的「生路」，在美國開映的時候，好萊塢各種電影刋物都有極公正的批評。電影界的輿論，很明顯的表示满意。他們專在燕尾服高帽櫻脣，以及所謂性感上作麻醉企圖的藝術家，或者拿奢華富裕向外誇耀的藝術家，亦有正當的勸察，他們悅然於蘇聨的電影事業，已在前進的道路上，開闢了一塊新園地。　　蘇聨影片在歐美各國所受的認識，亦不亞於在美國。雖然有幾國是絕對禁止蘇聨影片的入口的，像南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞等，但是大部分的國家，都有蘇聨出品中比較和緩者公映之允許，而「生路」一片在歐洲公映之處甚多，輿論所及，亦極贊尙。　　蘇聨的作品在一九三三年，反稱爲中國電影業之轉機時期中，居然亦與吾人相見。如「生路」與「亞洲風雲」。蘇聨製片業的眞相亦能使我們得到相當的認識。但對於他們製片的工作，尙有足以一述之處，在這裏我們可以約略的知道蘇聨電影業所以公認其成功的一般，或者可以作爲我們的借鏡。（未完）影片談評「美女世界」評LrsGrearToBeAlive  摩爾假使確切的認定歐美影片是含有下列二點。　　㈠積極的組織羣衆，來替他們服務，（像「國門之戰」等），或則宣示他們的理想和目的，（像「白宮風雲」等）。　　㈡消極的用醇酒，美人，怪異，玩好，來使羣衆忘掉現實。那未，一美女世界」無疑的是屬於後者的了。　　故事一望而知是空想的，「一九三八地球上蔓佈一種毒菌。殺人無算，死者皆男子，女性者無碍」。這已經用不到說明了。但是爲了一個女人而飛機横渡太平洋，爲了一個男子而開國際大會，一方面說明了現在的人們（自然是有閑的）是何等重視「戀愛」。一方面更用「克（少年）戀桃（克之舊情人）甚，堅欲娶之」，而「美女世界」中，所有的女子都「願犧牲一已」，來成全他們，做尊重愛情的說明。這是證明製作者，雖然空想，而還根據他自己的，和他一集團的思想和生活來創造故事。換一句話，就是製作者的觀念。是意識的，或下意識的，表現出來。　　但是「美女世界」，雖則空想，而我們對於「一九三八」的「毒菌」，的確應該憂慮的。第二次世界大戰的爆發，不是就在目前嗎？第一次大戰時，德法的男子，就死得可觀。那未，第二次大戰比第一次更激烈，犧牲的人也更多，不是當然的嗎？戰爭是實現的「毒菌」！我們無論如何得反對他，這或則不能算是閑話吧！看「美女世界」的觀衆，是會忘了現實的，我們應該告訴他們這一點。　　至於「美女世界」的本身，那末，我們可以從美國電影界的不景氣來說明他。美國電影一貫的是以明星爲中心，在過去，只要主角有名，觀衆就會萬人空巷的去看。但是後來，明星不能再號召了。於是就有各大導演各大明星來聨合號召，像「大飯店」「活財神」之類。不過這種影片的號召力，還是有限。所以他們就利用小市民的頽廢心理，把「好萊塢數千美女」來號召；幷且演成一個「女兒國」的故事。　　拿「女性」做中心，甚至完全用女性表演的，有德國片「女性」，但是「　是女性」是把握住現時代女子的痛苦，藝術的演出。雖則他還不能明徹的說明，現社會的婦女的命運，是和勞苦大衆同一條的。只有在總的經濟組織改變之下，婦女纔有出路，但是和「美女世界」是不可同日而語的！　　技術方面，無論導演，演員，以及置景攝影，差不多全能和他的内容相吻合。這是旣成社會的爛熟的「文明」（？）京大戲院客满矣！觀衆意見「母與子」觀後感  喻家卿　　（上略）劇情太不合時代了。幾個畫面突如其來，使我感到莫明其妙，。當我觀了本片之後，感覺到這是一個最大的缺點。和「道德寳鑑」有雷同之點，尤其是書塲中刦人之一幕，王公達拿藥毒死女妃之一幕。　　導演在本片中雖是很聰明，努力，顯示着他的技巧，但是小疵點的地方也很多：如晴雲偷看育嬰堂的簿册，偷文超的手槍，和到公達的寓所中，以我想没有這樣便當。　　演員如宣景琳在前半部表情很深刻，後半部太少面部的表演。龔稼農，朱秋痕，謝雲卿，尙合身份。鄭少秋，王徴信等平平而已。　　許斯登的惡作劇程蜂華爾脫許斯登是好萊塢最喜惡作劇的明星。在畫上看到的許斯登，是一位面相忠實，舉止穩重的壯年人；可是在工作之餘，又有誰曉得他是一個最狡猾最發噱的人呢，下面是他一段很有趣味的紀事：　　有一天，他到一家旅館裏去訪他一位才到好萊塢的朋友。那時還是大淸老早。他的朋友住在很高的七層樓上，於是他便想起坐電梯子。這樣，他發覺那位電梯司機人正在打盹。於是他底腦海裏便浮起一個惡作劇來。他劃了一根自來火，點着了那位可憐的老年人的鬍子，於是鬍子大燒起來。老年人驚醒了，不但鬍鬍燒得精光，上嘴唇也受了很重的傷。後來，許斯登除賠給醫藥費之外，尙給了那位老年人一百卅個金鎊方才了事。從這個故事看到這位許斯登確也太過分惡作劇了。麗琳哈蕙的令譽  魯賓麗琳哈蕙從主演了「龍翔鳳舞」以後，她的聲名就卓絕一時。後來她和福斯公司訂了約，離了德國而赴美了。當她到了好萊塢的時候，眞的是萬人空巷都想一覘風采。一直到現在，好萊塢裏面提到了麗琳又誰不稱贊她一聲呢。但是她所以得了這們的榮譽！也不是僥倖的。譬如說吧，夜裏她工作了整夜，但是一淸早吃了早餐，她又按時的在攝影塲裏面了。到了下午她照例是可以休息的了，當公司裏面爲了一點很小很小的事情，派人來喚她去，但是當他們知道她正在好睡而悄悄的想退出去的時候，她霍然驚醒，她喚住了他們，問明白了，他略爲整理一下，又很高興的隨着他們一同去了。爲了她這樣的和氣和不怕厭煩，所以她的義務宣傳也就特别的多了　　因爲她是這樣紅極一時，於是種種謠言也就從此發生，有的說加萊古物愛她甚至要和妻子離婚。有的說希佛萊也正在追求着她。這些種種雖然都不是眞的，但是我們也可以知道人們對於她們的注意了。蕭索聲中之巨片  花月　　這個年頭，不景氣彌漫好萊塢全市。各影片公司有的縮小計畫，節省費用；有的暫停營業。從事整頓。前者像米高梅，福克斯，華納兄弟，後者像環球。再有那最悽慘的是派拉蒙公司，甚至宣佈破產。整個好萊塢是在瘡痍满目的局中。按表面看來，各公司的出品，一定是不大高妙，然而適得其反，鉅片層見疊出，川流不息，這眞使人奇極。以前的「大飯店」·「羅宮春色」不講，最近幾家大公司都有鉅製出廠，尤其是福克斯和米高梅兩家。　　福克斯自内部改組後。傾全力於出品方面。更聘到前派拉蒙製片巨頭拉斯基先生爲監製。他的成績品有「女兒國」和「佈達派斯動物園」（ZooinBudspest）。以及「亂世春秋」等。米高梅自實行「多星合作，」的計畫以後，結果大獲成效。像「大飯店」，「白姊妹」，「天長地久」，都受人歡迎。本年度仍貫澈這計畫，要攝製正片四十八部。其中最偉大的超以前的要算「八時晚餐」（DinnerAtNight)一片了。片内有十二個大明星，如瑪麗德漱拉，華利史皮萊，約翰擺里摩亞，李昻擺里摩亞，琪恩哈羅，美芝伊文絲，統通羅致在内，就成了一部吸力最强，令人满意的出品。　　藝華擴大組織伶央　　藝華影片公司自從「民族生存」「肉博」兩部片子相繼完成後，卽將組織擴大：分爲三組，第一組由彭飛主任，第二組由查瑞龍主任，復延聘聨華一廠劇務部蘇怡爲第三組主任。資本增至三十餘萬元，在原有康腦脫路的攝影塲建築玻璃棚，設置收音機，燈光等等，準備攝製有聲片。職員方面，也廣延名家加入丨如攝影師周詩祿，導演岳楓，胡塗，蘇怡等。歌舞明星胡笳，龔秋霞等亦相繼加入該公司工作云。電影小說殺讎殉愛StrangeRhapsody(五)  達克　　杜叔想了一想，然後歡然地說道：「好孩子，你說得很對。你是我最好的朋友。」奇薩的内心如被刀剌一樣。他說：「我儘力地不辜負你的好意是了。」　　奇薩現在的軍法官比得萊，住在村裡，竭力地工作着，去忘記他心内的創傷。但是很奇怪的，戰事已經告終了。巴克斯喀重復爲塞爾維亞的統治地。奇薩的地位被一個狡詭的小男子呌邦託的奪了去。邦託本來是杜叔的馬夫，可是他生平最恨的就是杜叔和奇薩二人。當他接住的那天，他那種驕塞的神氣，使奇薩氣得面都發靑了。杜叔在旁替他的朋友不平，但是敢她而不敢言。奇薩交代過了一切事情，杜督因爲還要料理别的事務走開了。奇薩一個人爬在桌子上，聽了外面慶祝巴克斯喀復國之鐘聲，心中痛如刀割。忽然有人在他的面前，呌着他的名字。他抬起頭來一看，原來是愛琳娜。他說：「這個地方，你怎麽來得？」愛琳娜道：我亦没有法子。外面各處掛满了旗，我想着你獨自一個人在這裏，多麽難過。」他們講了一「回，愛琳娜忽然情不自禁地走近了奇薩，她的臂膀困住了奇薩的頸。她說；「我知道你要走了，我要跟你走。我一切都不顧了。我愛你。我不能放你去了。」他們熱烈地吻着。愛琳娜重新要求他帶她一同走。奇薩最後答應了，但是他說：「可是我們二人之外，還有一個人同行。」愛琳娜想了一想，很驚惶地問題：「是杜叔嗎？」奇薩點着頭，歎口氣說道：「是的，杜叔是永久離不開的。我們每次相吻，他總在中間的。他是我的朋友，你的丈夫，難道你能夠脫離他嗎？」愛琳娜不假思索的道：「我能！」奇薩默然地道：「好，明天吧。」愛琳娜望着他有些害怕起來，她說：「你到那時會看不起我嗎？」奇薩道：「說不定的。」愛琳娜聽了他的話，手放鬆了，倒退了幾步，很惶恐的說道：「我自己亦將看不起我自己了。再會吧，奇薩。今生今世，這是未一次和你相會了。」奇薩看了他可憐的樣子，着實有些不忍。他伸出手來，奇薩低着頭吻着。外面忽然走過一個人的影子。　　「杜叔」，他低低呌着。他們竭力裝作鎭靜，但是他們神經錯亂，以及良心上的不安，因爲他們不是慣作虚僞的人，就是極信任他們的杜叔，亦看出了他們的破綻。他們面色的靑白，神情的緊，太明顯了。杜叔默然地帶了愛琳娜回去，一路思維着，心中的怒潮起伏着。（未完）</p>

<h3>To Be Established in Beijing as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Nanjing: In order to meet the practical needs, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has decided to be established in Beijing on September 1st. It will have two departments: General Affairs and Engineering. The Yellow River Downstream Dike Engineering Office will be divided into three districts: the first district in Henan, headed by Chen Ruzhen; the second district in Hebei, headed by Sun Qingze; and the third district in Shandong, headed by Zhang Lianjia.

They will be responsible for closing breaches and repairing dikes according to the approved plan. The heads of each engineering office will be concurrently held by the directors of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau appointed by the commission. For all projects undertaken by each office, the heads may submit a request to the commission to requisition soldiers and laborers from the local military and political organs. This will be submitted for discussion at the Flood Control Conference on the 28th. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>Increased Japanese Troops in Miyun</p>
<h3>Although Nominally Received by Us</h3>
<h3>In Reality Still Controlled by Them</h3>
<p>Beiping: Since the takeover of Miyun County, the Japanese army's Suzuki Brigade Commander indicated that he would lead his troops out of Gubeikou, leaving a small unit stationed in Miyun. Our side has already agreed. When the Suzuki Brigade retreated, they planned to leave 30-40 Japanese soldiers, but instead, they repeatedly transferred 50-60 Japanese soldiers from Chengde, claiming it was a rotation of personnel, reaching a total of 200. They take turns guarding the city gates, and Japanese soldiers strictly inspect pedestrians. Although nominally taken over by our side, it is actually controlled by the Japanese. Banditry is rife everywhere. In Shixia Town, there are still 50-60 Japanese soldiers, and the city gates are guarded by Japanese soldiers. The county is divided into seven districts, with Gubeikou belonging to the fifth district. Recently, the Japanese side has set up a Public Security Bureau Chief and a General Donation Bureau in Gubeikou from Luanping County, implementing jurisdiction. The announcements are all under the name of the Luanping County Government. The fifth district of Miyun is likely to be划归 to Luanping. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Japanese Telegram: Bandits Disturb</p>
<h3>Chaos in Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to a telegram received here, a large number of bandits attacked Qinhuangdao on the evening of the 24th, demanding 30,000 yuan in military expenses from the General Chamber of Commerce. They clashed with the security team in various parts of the city, causing great chaos for a time. Japanese police from Shanhaiguan sent personnel to protect Japanese residents.

<h3>Red Spears Society Kills Enemies</h3>
<p>Harbin: According to news from official circles here, a detachment of troops stationed at Yimianpo marched towards Fangzheng. They engaged the Red Spears Society in battle for an hour and defeated them. The Red Spears Society suffered 14 deaths, while the Japanese soldiers had one killed and one wounded. In addition, a detachment of Japanese soldiers departing from Jiamusi crossed the Songhua River and attacked 100 anti-Manchu soldiers gathered in nearby villages who planned to attack Jiamusi. As a result, 30 anti-Manchu soldiers were killed, and one Japanese sergeant was killed in action. The Manchu-Japanese military circles are currently planning a new plan to suppress bandits, intending to prohibit the ransoming of those kidnapped and restrict traffic in bandit areas.

<p>The Tao'er River Has Risen Greatly</p>
<h3>The Tao'ang Railway Is Impassable</h3>
<p>Shenyang: Due to the great increase in the water of the Tao'er River, it no longer resembles a small river twenty bays wide, and the tides are raging, with the banks almost becoming a sea of mud. The Tao'ang Railway from Taonan north to Tao'an has been completely flooded, and the flooded area along the railway is gradually expanding, causing the suspension of freight transport above Taonan. As for passengers and luggage, they are transported by specially arranged connecting boats. Currently, the winds and waves on the Tao'er River are very strong, making even connecting transport dangerous. Therefore, connecting transport for passengers traveling to Qiqihar is temporarily hopeless. The current plan is to adopt the route via Harbin.

<p>The Process of Cotton and Wheat Loans</p>
<h3>There Will Be a Public Report</h3>
<p>Nanjing: There are divergent opinions regarding Finance Minister Soong's success in securing cotton and wheat loans in the United States. President Wang stated in his memorial week report that unscrupulous merchants intentionally manipulated the situation, causing domestic wheat sales to stagnate and prices to fall. The Executive Yuan ordered the ministry to send a special commissioner to investigate the truth. According to a certain member of the industry, the reason for the stagnation and price decline of domestic wheat is not due to manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, nor is it due to the impact of American wheat being transported to China. The real reason is that the North China wheat flour market has been seized by Japan, the United States, and Soviet Russia, leading to a significant reduction in sales. The first batch of American cotton is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. The method of managing the first batch of American wheat arriving in Shanghai, which is expected in October, has been roughly agreed upon, awaiting Soong's final decision. In order to make the content of the loan clear to all sectors, the government intends to request Soong to make a detailed public report on the progress of the loan upon his return to China.

<p>Xinglong County's Takeover Rejected</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Li Ying Sets Up Office in Malan峪</h3>
<h3>The Japanese Side Actually Notified the County Magistrate to Retreat Immediately</h3>
<h3>The Reason Being That Xinglong Had Been Assigned to a Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Beiping: Xinglong County is located outside the Great Wall line. The War Zone Reception Committee has sent County Magistrate Li Ying with a small number of police to take over. As there are still Japanese troops stationed in the county seat, the County Magistrate has set up the county government office in Malan峪. It is reported that the Japanese side has notified the County Magistrate to retreat immediately, citing the reason that Xinglong County has been划为 to Qinglong County by the puppet state and is Manchuria's territory, and China should not take it over. Li telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government and the War Zone Reception Committee yesterday to request instructions on how to proceed. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Soong Arrives in Zhangbei, But Fang Has Left</p>
<h3>Local Order Gradually Restored</h3>
<h3>Soong Sends Zhang Yunrong to Meet Fang Zhenwu to Persuade Him</h3>
<h3>Ji Hongchang Decides to Detour Away from Chahar at Daqinggou</h3>
<p>Zhangbei: Soong Che-yuan and Xiao Zhenying arrived here at 5 PM on the 26th. Fang Zhenwu had already left. Local order has been restored. Soong sent Zhang Yunrong and Chen Xiwen to Erkouzi on the morning of the 27th to meet Fang and persuade him. After Fang met Zhang and Chen, he quickly went to Dushikou. Ji arrived at Daqinggou, and because his troops were scattered, he decided to detour away from Chahar. Soong is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou on the 28th. The rumor that Baochang had fallen is not accurate. Soong issued an order on the 27th to suppress scattered soldiers and strictly prohibit Communists. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Soong Che-yuan and Xiao Zhenying went to Zhangbei yesterday to meet with Ji Hongchang and Fang Zhenwu. Other miscellaneous troops should be disbanded, and officers and soldiers are being dealt with separately. They have been transported back to their hometowns via the Ping Sui Railway for days. However, there are still many officers and soldiers who need to be eliminated. Soong has requested the Military Branch Committee to ask the Central Government to allocate funds for subsidies to facilitate early reorganization. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Zhangjiakou telegram: After Soong and Xiao arrived in Zhangbei on the 26th, they immediately used a long-distance telephone to communicate with Kangbao, inviting Fang to Zhangbei to meet and talk. Because Fang's whereabouts were unclear, they were unable to meet. Fang's instructor has already followed Fang to eastern Chahar. Hou Ying took a car to Zhangbei yesterday to inspect. Sun Liangcheng, Zhang Yunrong, and Zhang Renjie's units are scheduled to return with Soong on the 27th. Zhao Dengyu arrived in Zhangjiakou from Shishi on the 26th. His unit has been ordered to go to Wanquan to take over defense. Sun Liangcheng was introduced by Zhao Dengyu on the evening of the 26th and had a long conversation with Jiang Bocheng. Sun stated that he had stopped making announcements, and after Soong returned to Zhangjiakou, Sun would set off. Sun's unit decided to listen to the Military Branch Committee's reorganization, and the number of personnel would not be questioned. Jiang telegraphed He to report on Sun's past and present situation. He telegraphed Jiang this morning, hoping that Sun could still serve in Beijing and even hoped to meet in person. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The 100,000 yuan in reorganization expenses previously brought by Soong Che-yuan have been used up in two days. A total of over 10,000 people have been demobilized. There is still a part waiting to be demobilized, but the funds are insufficient. Soong has telegraphed Xiong to forward the message to the Military Branch Committee, asking for help. Fang and Ji's units are about to be reorganized. Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong have taken up new military positions. Fang Zhenwu can go abroad once the funds are allocated. Although Ji Hongchang has left the army, he plans to stay in Chahar for a while and does not want to travel far. Liu Guitang and other units can also be expected to comply after Soong negotiates with various parties, and there are no major problems. Yang Zhennan, who came to Beiping with Xiong earlier, is scheduled to return to Zhang tomorrow to report. Jiang Bocheng must wait until Soong returns from Zhangbei to Zhangjiakou and everything is negotiated before he can return to Beiping. Qin Decun plans to come to Beiping with Jiang to attend the Military Branch Committee's regular meeting on the 30th. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou: Soong Che-yuan is in Zhangbei and will not return to Zhang today. The East Asia League Army led by Suo Huacheng entered Guyuan on the 25th. Liu Guitang announced his assumption of the position of guerrilla commander. Ji Hongchang's army is stationed in Baochang. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: He Yingqin answered reporters' questions, saying that he received a telegram from Zhangjiakou yesterday saying that Soong went to Wanquan and then to Zhangbei. As for whether he met with Fang in Zhangbei, he has not yet received a telegram and does not know the details. Fang's subordinates are only over a thousand people and have little strength. Although his demeanor is stubborn, it is of no help. However, although Ji's subordinates also have little real strength, most are Communists, and it is feared that this unit will be difficult to comply. As for whether his troops have advanced towards Baochang, it is not yet known. All post-disaster affairs in Chahar are entrusted to Soong for handling. If Fang and Ji's units do not comply, Soong has full authority to deal with it, and there is no need to worry. Whether Zhang and Ruan's letters of appointment have been delivered is still unknown. Liu Guitang is gathering in Chicheng, building fortifications, and extorting donations. This has been reported and is also part of the post-disaster affairs in Chahar Province, which Soong will be able to handle properly. Huang is waiting in Shanghai to meet Soong Tzu-wen before returning to Beiping. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Soong telegraphed the authorities yesterday asking for instructions on the matter of Tang Yulin's unit retreating to Guyuan and requesting reorganization. It is reported that the authorities have replied by telegram that if they are sincere, reorganization is not impossible. (Special dispatch on the 27th) Zhangjiakou: The newly编檀 Zixin Division opened in Yanqing on the 25th, and Li Zhongyi's troops opened in Huailai. Tan was a former subordinate of Ma Zhanshan. This time, the reorganization restored the original number of the Tenth Cavalry Division. According to Tan, he led his troops from Jiang to Re and then to Cha. Just as Feng Xing was resisting Japan, his unit took resistance against Japan as its main purpose, so he resolutely joined. Now that the military affairs have ended, he will abide by the Central Government in the future. If there is an opportunity, he will still vow to follow the vanguard. According to Wang Hongru, the representative of Tang, his unit is now in Datang area of Guyuan. Tang himself is in Datang, with a total of 14,000 people and 18,000 guns. He hopes that the Central Government can give them a civil reorganization so that they can serve the country. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

Soong telegraphed Wang and the Relief Committee, saying that the disaster in Chahar was particularly severe, and the people were living in dire straits, and asked them to find ways to provide relief as soon as possible. Wang replied by telegram, saying that the disaster in Chahar was particularly severe and deeply distressing, and that in addition to ordering the Resident Peiping Political Committee and the North China War Zone Relief Committee to investigate and provide relief, he made a special reply. The Relief Committee also sent a reply telegram to Song. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Uchida Expects</p>
<h3>Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan</h3>
<h3>But Still Not Awakened Regarding the Aggression Against Manchuria</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Uchida, accompanied by his family, went to his villa in Hakone Mountain's Owakudani on the afternoon of the 26th to spend the end of the month. The Foreign Minister told reporters at the villa that since the Manchurian Incident occurred, he has been directly involved in the administration and has been handling affairs, so he feels quite tired. Today he brought his family here for a temporary quiet rest. His mission is almost complete, and soon there will be young and capable people to take over. He will continue to perform his duties. Due to the situation between the two countries, Japan's diplomatic relations with China are gradually moving towards direct negotiations. Now there is no other way but to wait quietly for the opportunity to arrive. He also very much hopes that this opportunity will arrive soon. Soong Tzu-wen will arrive in this country in a day or two and will directly discuss various issues with Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Huang Fu and others. The result seems to follow Chiang Kai-shek's policy. The Washington and London Naval Treaties are still valid until 1936. A meeting will be held in 1935 to discuss naval issues, so naval issues will inevitably become an important issue for the world in the future. Naval countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will never engage in unnecessary competition. Japan needs to study countermeasures for this. Japan's Manchuria policy is progressing smoothly. Although there are various discussions about its branch issues, it can be said that there is no error in observing it from the overall situation. (United Press dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Uchida told reporters in the car yesterday on his way to Hakone that China's policy toward Japan is unlikely to change suddenly because of Soong Tzu-wen's return home. Therefore, there is no need for Japan to immediately order Ambassador Ariyoshi to return home or to change its policy toward China from quiet observation to an active policy. Regarding the Manchuria issue, the "State of Manchuria" is developing smoothly. Although there are those who do not agree with Japan's policy toward Manchuria, there is nothing that can be done about disagreeing with national policy. What is most important is to firmly grasp the grand outline of a fair and just national policy. Regarding the US issue, the Japan-US Arbitration Treaty discussed by Ishii Kikujiro and the US President in Washington was only mentioned occasionally at the time, and there has been no special progress since then. Regarding the issue of arms reduction, both the Washington and London Treaties will hold revision meetings in 1935. This meeting is very important for Japan. In March of that year, it will also be time to realize the withdrawal from the League of Nations. International relations are becoming increasingly complex. On the one hand, we must move forward with a peaceful attitude, and on the other hand, we must have sufficient awareness and careful attention. However, there is no need to rush at this time. Adapt to the circumstances, express your beliefs, and strive to implement Japan's demands. (Electric Communication Society dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Fourth Plenary Session of the National参政会 resolved to convene on Double Ten Day this year. However, due to the central government's proposal to convene a National Assembly in advance, the convening of the National参政会 has been indefinitely postponed. During the Lushan Conference, it was generally felt that since the date of the National Assembly had not been determined, the government might as well convene the National参政会 first in order to get closer to the people's opinions. There is nothing wrong with this in terms of both reason and law. The Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee has recently been preparing to redraft the Organization Law and Election Law of the 参政会, but the convening date will be no earlier than next spring.

<p>Nanjing: The funds for foreign envoys should be paid at the rate of 700,000 yuan per month, but the government's fundraising capacity is only 300,000 yuan per month, which is a huge shortfall. Recently, the funds for envoys have been in arrears for three months, and the envoys have been urging them by telegram, which is difficult for the government to cope with. It is reported that some consulates in unimportant ports with weak commercial relations with China and foreign countries will soon adopt an austerity policy and be deleted and merged.

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Focusing Efforts on Governing the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Ming</p>
<p>This year, the Yellow River has flooded extensively, a situation unseen in nearly fifty years. The lower reaches, including Shandong's Caozhou and Dong'a areas, have already been breached, causing significant losses to the people. Northern Jiangsu has also been affected, and although no major disaster has yet occurred, the trend suggests it may be difficult to avoid. The disaster in Henan is also quite severe, with even areas upstream from Zhengzhou, which are usually less prone to flooding, not spared. Shanxi, located upstream and with generally good drainage, would seem unlikely to suffer, but the Fen River basin in western Shanxi has also experienced major flooding, further exacerbating the downstream Yellow River floods. Our observation is that the causes of the flooding below Zhengzhou are threefold. First, the Yellow River's water is muddy, causing the flow to be slow, leading to siltation of the riverbed. The banks are not stable, and the river mouth forms alluvial land higher than the riverbed, turning areas like Henan and Shandong into marshlands. Second, both banks of the Yellow River, from Suiyuan to the coast, are composed of yellow mud, prone to collapse under rapid erosion. Third, the Yellow River basin has been developed for a long time, with a dense population and difficult living conditions. People generally seek only immediate relief, neglecting long-term planning. Consequently, no one pays attention to cultivating forests along the Yellow River banks, and existing forests have been almost completely cut down. These three factors contribute to the Yellow River's flooding.</p>
<p>Those governing the Yellow River have always been aware of these reasons. However, from the late Qing dynasty to the present day, their efforts have mainly focused on blocking the water. Whenever floods arrive, the entire nation rushes to build dams and barricades. Once autumn and winter come and the flood subsides, they relax their efforts and no longer pay attention. This has led to the decline of civilization in northern China. If this continues without fundamental repairs, I fear that the Yellow River basin in North China, from Longmen downstream, may become a desert. Looking back at the history of the Yellow River, floods occur every two to thirty years, with major floods every fifty to sixty years. Each major flood causes losses to the people of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu of at least hundreds of millions. This demonstrates the necessity of fundamentally repairing the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The fundamental methods for governing the river are: first, dredging to keep the water flowing in a fixed channel and prevent siltation; second, building long, water-controlling dikes to allow the water to flow quickly, scouring the sediment from the riverbed; and third, dredging the river mouth and building seawalls there to prevent it from becoming a shallow beach, ensuring the river water flows unimpeded into the sea. These three projects are massive. In terms of time, they cannot be completed in ten or eight years. In terms of money, they require more than 500 million yuan. Given the poverty of China's treasury and people today, where will such a huge sum come from for this ambitious long-term plan? However, to permanently eliminate the threat of floods, we must be determined to make this grand wish. Now the capital will convene a flood control conference of six provinces, which shows that the central government attaches great importance to this. However, we especially hope that the government can grasp the key points, make overall plans, and unify the various water control agencies. It is not advisable to have each province pursue its own interests separately. Some associations advocate certain plans, some provinces advocate first governing a certain river, or managing canals, or diverting the Huai River. Their arguments may be reasonable and persuasive, but if their proposals are inconsistent and based on the interests of one province, it will be impossible to harness the power of the whole country to govern the river. The result will only be more debate and disputes, without any practical achievements. Therefore, I say that if we want to fundamentally govern the river today, we must have an overall plan.</p>
<p>If we say that today there is no huge financial capacity to make this fundamental and long-term plan, and we have to resort to the lesser measure of treating the symptoms, we cannot rely solely on blocking measures and focus only on temporary relief. The effect of blocking is only to maintain the situation for two or three years. Therefore, even when treating the symptoms, we should make a twenty-to-thirty-year plan to plant trees and cultivate forests along the river. This will stabilize the foundations of the dikes, reduce the amount of sediment carried by the water, and absorb moisture to regulate rainfall, which can clarify the Yellow River's muddy flow. The second measure is to repair ditches. The ditches in the north have been abandoned for a long time, and in the summer, excessive rain has nowhere to go. Therefore, clearing the ditches is also very important. It can guide the flow of water to divert the Yellow River's flow and can also be used for irrigation, while consuming less manpower and financial resources. (There are more than just these symptom-treating methods, but only one example is given here.) Now, if we have to resort to treating the symptoms, this approach can be effective in ten years, depending on the dedication of the people.</p>

<h3>American Recovery Plan Will Succeed</h3>
<p>A well-known financial leader on Wall Street in New York stated today that President Roosevelt plans to meet with Governor Norman of the Bank of England at Hyde Park next week to discuss stabilizing the gold dollar and the gold pound. Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson, President Harrison of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Director of the Budget Douglas will also participate in the talks. It is reported that all proposals related to stabilizing Anglo-American currencies, including the establishment of an international stabilization fund, will be placed on the agenda for discussion. War debts will be mentioned, but will not be the main topic.</p>
<p>The Era of Experimentation with Monetary Policy is Nearing its End. It is also heard that the era of experimentation with American monetary policy is nearing its end. The US government will proceed to discuss stabilizing exchange rates from the standpoint of foreign trade and its relationship to the Industrial Recovery Plan. It is reported that the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, in addition to agreeing with the plan of European central banks to consolidate themselves and quietly await the end of the American experiment, has taken very few measures regarding international finance. Most of the bank's directors firmly believe that the American experiment will end within three months. However, unless the United States and Britain take action on the issue of stabilizing exchange rates, the bank will continue its wait-and-see policy.</p>
<p>According to what was heard tonight, another reason why the US President will meet with the Governor of the Bank of England next week to discuss stabilization issues is that the price of the US dollar in the international exchange market is often manipulated by foreign speculators, causing it to fluctuate and hinder American foreign trade. Moreover, the US government had hoped that by devaluing the gold dollar, it could make domestic goods easier to sell in foreign markets and make it more difficult for foreign goods to sell domestically. Unexpectedly, the result was the opposite. In June, trade imports actually increased, while exports failed to meet expectations, because the fluctuating exchange rates made it difficult for exporters to quote prices in many respects.</p>
<p>Authorities Believe the Industrial Recovery Plan Will Succeed. According to news from Washington received here, the US President is confident that the Industrial Recovery Plan will succeed. Industrial Recovery Administrator Johnson also believes that the Industrial Recovery Plan has made sufficient progress and that there is no need to further inflate the currency. The Washington telegram, which said that there would be no changes in monetary policy, meant that when the quantity of industrial production and the quantity of goods consumed both increase, there is no need to disturb the gold dollar.</p>
<p>Today, the US President, speaking to some friends in the square of Vassar College, said that the economic tide in the United States has indeed changed direction and is now beginning to enter an upward phase. The plans of the National Industrial Recovery Administration are on the road to success, and he expressed gratitude for the cooperation of various industries with the government, saying that some opposition was expected and was mostly sincere opposition, without any ulterior motives. However, the number of people using machines is now greater than before, the number of unemployed workers who have regained employment is increasing day by day, and the amount of business in stores has also increased, etc. This speech is sufficient to confirm that the US President is indeed optimistic about the success of the Industrial Recovery Plan.</p>
<p>However, the banking community also acknowledges that the devaluation of the gold dollar has been beneficial in protecting the American market and resisting competition from countries with devalued currencies, and has indeed offset the adverse effects of American isolation, making the trade surplus closer to a sound situation. Therefore, whether the devaluation of the gold dollar still needs to be extended will probably be one of the things discussed at Hyde Park.</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller, the richest oil tycoon in the world, today issued an article urging people from all walks of life across the country to unite and promote the success of the National Industrial Recovery Act, saying that this plan is worth achieving its objectives at any sacrifice.

<p>European Gold Standard Countries Quietly Await the Restoration of the Gold Dollar. Financial representatives of European gold standard countries have said that the work of international banks is</p>
<p>Waiting quietly for the restoration of the gold standard for the gold dollar. However, whether the US President will discuss this with Norman is not yet indicated tonight. (National News dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington. President Roosevelt's current goal is to restore prices and prosperity to the levels of 1924 and 1925. However, according to the opinions of American newspapers, Roosevelt is preparing to use the powers he enjoys under the Recovery Act to raise prices and encourage commercial activity through currency inflation or dollar devaluation. Recovery procedures and currency inflation are now in competition, but judging from the current situation, President Roosevelt will have to wait until the measures of expanding purchasing power and increasing wages and jobs through industry regulations fail before using currency inflation as the final weapon to deal with the situation.

<p>New York. The American underwear industry, as autumn approaches and the demand for underwear is strong, has decided to join other industries in sharing the benefits of the "Blue Eagle" movement. Today, representatives of factories accounting for 95% of the industry have jointly drafted industry regulations and submitted them to the government for approval. These regulations stipulate a minimum wage of $13 per week, a maximum workweek of 40 hours, and promise to improve the health conditions of workers. If these industry regulations are approved by the US President, government propagandists will advise people to purchase products from these factories. (National News dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Dollar and Pound Falls, Germany is in Panic. Berlin. Severe panic has occurred here since hearing that the American dollar and gold pound have fallen again. The impact of this new change on the German market is that it will be more difficult for German goods to be sold abroad in the future, because under the current situation, Germany has to seek foreign currencies to pay for imported goods and repay foreign debts, etc., and this matter is becoming more and more difficult. As for the final result, it is still unfavorable to countries with low currency values. Germany or other countries with stable currencies will stop buying, and countries with low currency values will have no way to sell. Germany's attempt to restore foreign trade has been dealt a blow, and the government's efforts to overcome unemployment will also be affected. However, economic and financial circles have expressed hope that the world's financial situation will soon improve, and Germany will eventually be able to emerge from its multi-economic crisis and trade stagnation.

<p>Roosevelt</p>
<h3>Announces Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p>New York. President Roosevelt, speaking today at the famous women's college, Vassar College, revealed a new principle, saying that for the sake of the family and for the sake of society, individuals and families are not allowed to do things that harm their neighbors. President Roosevelt mentioned in his speech the success of the National Industrial Recovery Program, saying that it has shown signs of turning from bad to good. He also said that the expansion of the idea of not harming one's neighbors must not be recognized as an impediment to individual freedom, because advising people to pay adequate wages, advising people not to hire child labor, or advising people not to cause annoyance, are all kinds of restrictions. In terms of national consciousness, the so-called neighbors are the entire people of the United States. If the people of the north do not help the people of the south or the west, then we cannot give special consideration to the people of the north. We cannot favor one industry to the detriment of another. This kind of good neighbor policy should also be applied to the problems of local governments. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Japanese Militarists and Feudal Forces Oppose</p>
<h3>Saito's Policy of Compromise</h3>
<p>Tokyo. The compromise between the Saito Cabinet and the Seiyukai (Friends of Politics Association) has aroused the opposition of the militarists and feudal remnants. If the Seiyukai makes things difficult for Prime Minister Saito and wastes time in the national policy agreement work, this compromise may not succeed. Because the nature of this compromise is purely a preliminary work for the financial cliques to restore their political power, the militarists and the feudal forces in the Upper House are very dissatisfied for their own interests. For example, the political group of the militarists, the "Meirin Association," has expressed opposition to the so-called compromise in the past, and the "Koseikai" in the Upper House also held a meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 to decide to oppose the compromise. Fascist violent groups such as the Japan Production Party are also</p>
<p>Intensifying their work in various places to overthrow the Progressive Party and overthrow the financial cliques under the pretext of rescuing comrades in the May 15th Incident. Because of this situation, the attitude expressed by Suzuki when he meets with Saito in the middle of next week will be sufficient to predict the future of the Japanese political situation.

<p>Herriot Arrives in Soviet Russia</p>
<h3>To Promote Peaceful Relations Between France and Russia</h3>
<h3>Warm Welcome from All Sectors of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Tass, Odessa, 26th. Former French Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Party, Mr. Herriot, arrived in Odessa at 9:15 this morning. This is Mr. Herriot's second trip to the Soviet Union. Local officials, representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and journalists warmly welcomed the arrival of this French politician in the Soviet Union. In response to the welcome from the Foreign Affairs Committee and representatives of the Odessa District Executive Committee, Mr. Herriot expressed his deep gratitude for the friendly welcome he received and asked that his gratitude be conveyed to the workers of the city of Odessa and its district. He said, "I am very fortunate to be able to return to the Soviet Union. I sincerely hope that this trip will promote peace and benefit the Soviet and French nations. Please convey my wish to the workers you represent." At the request of a newsreel photographer, Mr. Herriot made a short speech in front of a microphone, repeating his gratitude for the welcome and his hope that the trip would promote peace. He said, "I firmly believe that the future of the people of the Soviet Union is very bright, and I have been working hard to promote friendship between France and the Soviet Union and to strengthen relations between the two countries." In a conversation with a reporter from the local newspaper "Chernomorskaia Kommuna," Mr. Herriot stated that he wanted to understand the achievements of the Soviet Union in industry, agriculture, and culture. He said, "As you know, this is my second trip here, so I am eager to know how much progress has been made since my last visit. I hope to stay in the Soviet Union until I leave here on September 10th, but whether I can stay here for such a long time has not yet been determined."</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 27th. The Soviet Union government gazette "Izvestia" today carried an editorial on Mr. Herriot's visit to the Soviet Union, declaring that the Soviet people will warmly welcome the visit of this French politician, as Mr. Herriot's name is well known to the Soviet people. The newspaper pointed out that Mr. Herriot has played a decisive role in the history of Franco-Soviet relations and in other aspects of French foreign policy. The newspaper also said, "Even in 1920, Mr. Herriot understood that the October Revolution was an event of the greatest historical significance. In 1922, he came to the Soviet Union and strongly advocated friendship between France and the Soviet Republic. Two years later, in 1924, he raised the issue of France's diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and actually realized his claim. In 1931, he expressed his deepest concern in the plan of the Franco-Soviet non-aggression pact and strove to promote the establishment of this pact." The newspaper further said, "Mr. Herriot's second visit to the Soviet Union at this time coincides with the greatest development of socialist construction throughout the Soviet Union and the deepest crisis in the capitalist world. The hope of the international bourgeoisie in the past that the Soviet Union would retreat to the old road of capitalism has disappeared in the current situation. The indisputable fact of the consolidation of Soviet power is now recognized by the world, and at the same time, all the famous intellectuals of the bourgeoisie understand the importance of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and intimately appreciate the cultural decline caused by the crisis in the capitalist world and the elements of barbarous madness incited by Fascism. They will now increasingly understand the positive progress of the Soviet Union's position in international relations and in the struggle against the threat of war." The newspaper concluded, "Mr. Herriot is undoubtedly one of the far-sighted bourgeois politicians who correctly understands the position of the Soviet Union as an international factor. When he arrives in Soviet territory, he expresses his desire to promote peace. The Soviet people also have the same expectations as Mr. Herriot and are willing to help Mr. Herriot consolidate the peaceful relations between France and the Soviet Union."</p>

This airfield is only a few kilometers from the Austrian border and faces the Austrian airfield in Salzburg from a distance. Germany's intention to confront Austria is clearly visible. The Austrian government is afraid that an accident may occur during the German airfield's opening ceremony, so it has transferred 300 auxiliary police from Salzburg to the border to assist the gendarmes stationed there.</p>

He recently issued a plan to reorganize the Baojia system and eliminate scattered bandits, ordering the commanders-in-chief of various routes and the provincial governments to diligently reorganize, pointing out the general shortcomings: 1. Lack of prioritization between urgent and non-urgent matters; 2. Inflexible implementation; 3. Failure to effectively carry out tasks. In the future, priorities should be considered based on time and location. Emergency organization should be implemented in newly recovered areas to unite against external aggression, eliminate internal traitors, assist military police in suppressing bandits, build fortresses and highways, inspect incoming and outgoing travelers, educate residents, and monitor reactionary activities. Jiang is also imitating the examples of Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi by employing local gentry to manage local militias to supplement the military and political administration.

<p>Prohibition of Exporting Scrap Copper, Iron, and Lead</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Defines the Scope of Metals</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance presented to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Ministry of Military Affairs proposed measures to prevent the enemy from purchasing scrap copper, lead, and iron. However, for the convenience of execution by various customs offices, it is necessary to define the scope of scrap copper, lead, and iron. It should include old and discarded copper, iron, and lead metal products: 1. Items made of copper, iron, and lead that have been broken or used (i.e., semi-finished products of these metals, such as sheets, rods, etc., are finished products), (such as wires, ropes, pipes, machine parts, shells, and many other products made of copper, iron, and lead), that are broken or rusted and cannot be directly used to remake other objects; 2. Copper, iron, and lead ash, fragments, etc., i.e., waste materials remaining from the raw materials or products of these metals undergoing processing. The above two types of old and discarded copper, iron, and lead have different forms but are not suitable for the manufacture of any items and can only be used for smelting and refining copper, iron, and lead ingots and casting various rough blanks. In other words, all copper, iron, and lead products that have one or two of the above properties and are only used for remelting can be considered scrap copper, iron, and lead metals as defined in this case. It is proposed to use this as the scope. Furthermore, upon investigation, many of these metal products are alloys. The metals referred to in this case should also include alloys to prevent merchants from taking advantage. In addition to issuing a notice to all customs supervisors to instruct the customs commissioners to comply with the regulations, the document is submitted for record and instructions.

The emergency blocking method will first be discussed with the River Affairs Bureaus of each province, and the River Affairs Bureaus will supervise the laborers to use hemp bags to block the breaches. 25,000 hemp bags from the Yangtze River Flood Defense Association and 5,000 bags still in Xiaguan, Beijing, will all be transported to Lankao within days for use.</p>
<p>Severe Flooding in Western Shandong</p>
<h3>Priority Issues for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Han Requests Speedy Blocking of Breaches to Save Lives</p>
<p>Jiang Has No Way to Use American Wheat for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Victims in Western Shandong Telegraph Denouncement of Liu Zhi</p>
<p>Provincial Government Plans to Tighten Funds and Transfer Funds for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>A dispatch from Ji'nan regarding the flooding in Western Shandong states that the situation is still serious. The following is a summary of information received from various sources:</p>
<h3>Saving Lives First</h3>
<p>Han Fuju telegraphed the National Government again yesterday, advocating saving lives first, stating: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Commander-in-Chief Jiang of Guling, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in Nanjing: The breach in Dongming, Hebei Province, has been almost a month, and half of Western Shandong has become a swamp. If this breach is not blocked quickly, winter will soon arrive, and the millions of people in the disaster area will have no clothes or food and will only freeze and starve to death. Therefore, blocking the breach is the priority issue at present. With funds, the blocking can begin, which is not difficult. If the Central Government is stingy with this small expense and delays the work, it will not affect the rich and honored in general. However, the people, who are hailed as the masters of the nation, are allowed to remain in the turbulent waves. It is impossible to obtain a piece of dry land and coarse food. Anyone with blood cannot help but grieve for the people. Some say that Fuju is a military man and his temperament is too impatient. In fact, the Yellow River breach is a major event in a province. For the whole country, raising several million yuan to save tens of millions of people seems not very difficult in terms of affairs and cannot be delayed in terms of reason. It is now autumn with clear skies. We should estimate the work, purchase materials, and recruit people. We should convene a meeting in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Jining, or Yanzhou to discuss the matter. Within a month, the breach may be blocked, so the flooded area will have no source of water, and the people can live in peace and resume their businesses. Afterward, we will make detailed plans on how to address the root causes and how to address the symptoms to seek a permanent solution. At present, we can only save lives quickly. Fuju has been neglecting sleep and food since hearing about the flood. I am a mere military man and do not know what to avoid, but I am speaking frankly. I beg your forgiveness and adoption. The telegram is urgent and awaits your command. Respectfully, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government."</p>
<h3>Jiang's Reply to Han</h3>
<p>Han Fuju repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Jiang, reporting the disaster and requesting the allocation of 2 million yuan from the American wheat sales proceeds to provide relief to the victims. Two telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Jiang to Han have now been received. The original text is as follows: 1. "To Chairman Han: Your telegram regarding the flooding in Shandong Province has been received. I have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government to coordinate disaster relief. Respectfully, Zhongzheng (Jiang)." 2. "To Chairman Han: Your telegram has been received. The Central Government has transferred flood prevention funds for the disaster relief in Jiangsu, Henan, and Shandong for emergency needs. It is still trying its best to raise more funds. The American cotton and wheat loan is a credit account and will not begin shipping to China until after November. We do not know when it will be fully disbursed and the sale proceeds will be available. The first year must raise US$10 million in advance. It is too slow to alleviate the emergency. There is no way to use it. Respectfully, Zhongzheng (Jiang)."</p>
<h3>Request to Punish Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>A telegram was sent from representatives of disaster victims in 18 counties in Western Shandong to the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and He, of the Beiping Military Branch Council stating: "The sudden flood in Western Shandong has turned the riverside areas into a swamp. People are adrift, villages are submerged, and more than a dozen counties have been affected. Millions have been injured. The dead have floated downstream, and the living have no home to return to. Some rely on villages and climb houses to survive, but they are pitiful in their hunger, cold, fatigue, and illness. Traffic is blocked, the flood is rampant, and it is too tragic to bear. It is difficult to describe in writing. Fortunately, the provincial government has sent personnel to distribute emergency relief, and the Central Government has also sent personnel to Shandong to plan relief. We endure the pain and await orders. What more can we say? However, the disaster victims have suffered this tragedy and barely survive. Tracing back to the origin of the disaster, it is difficult to remain silent. Since the breach in Changyuan, Hebei, we were deeply worried about flooding in Shandong. People were panic-stricken, and we were shocked several times a day. However, the breach was caused by bandits, who disregard national laws. We heard of it and were angered, but we were helpless. Unexpectedly, the situation became more unique. The Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Liu Zhi, openly sent a brigade to Lankao in the name of protecting the embankment and breached the dike to flood the downstream areas. The Lankao dike was breached that night, and the flood poured into Western Shandong. The floods of Heze, Shou Zhang, Fan, Guan, Cao, Shan, Yun, Ju, Pu, Juan, the ten counties of Caozhou, the Jining area, and Dong'a and Dongping rushed and suddenly turned into a huge disaster. They trended south towards Xuhai and will follow the old course. The local people sighed and hated it, and the nation was shocked. Newspapers were reporting and people were talking about it. Such a high-ranking official used troops to breach the dike and flooded a neighboring country, treating the lives of the people as a joke. This is a strange story in history and a disgrace to the nation. The disaster of the Communist bandits is nothing more than killing and arson. The harm of bandits is nothing more than harming lives and plotting money. Now, the officials who eat and tax the people and the leaders who protect the people with soldiers are willing to do what the Communist Party and bandits would not do. The floods and beasts are killing lives, which is more harmful than killing and arson. Millions of people have suffered. If they are not punished and allowed to live freely, the laws will be discarded and the rules will be swept away. The disaster victims have suffered and hate evil. We present the facts and dare to say what should not be said. We implore the government to consider the important river works, quickly clarify the laws and disciplines, punish the corrupt officials, and calm the people. As for the disaster victims who have suffered this catastrophe and have no hope of survival, we implore them to give special grace, provide assistance, and approve the provincial government's request to allocate huge amounts of money for relief. It is beyond our ability to thank you. Respectfully, the representatives of the disaster victims in 18 counties in Western Shandong, including Heze, Shou Zhang, Han Jizi, Chen Hanxuan, Sun Jieren, Sang Pingbo, Zhu Jinggu, Wan Xunchen, and Wang Ziyu."</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Tightens</h3>
<p>For the sake of providing relief to the refugees, in addition to repeatedly telegraphing the Central Government to request funds for disaster relief, it is also raising funds from the province. It has now implemented the abolition of the Department of Industry and the establishment of a section, which can save 200,000 yuan per year. The provincial government meeting yesterday (25th) approved the collection of three corners per mu instead of one tael of silver per ding in the disaster-stricken counties. It also plans to merge the local militias and the county public security bureaus, and appropriately reduce the salaries of civil servants. According to Chairman Han, there are many disaster victims in Western Shandong, and winter will soon arrive. Clothing, food, and housing all need relief. The province has repeatedly allocated funds for emergency relief, but it is only a drop in the bucket and cannot save everyone. Therefore, it is planned to tighten up in all aspects to provide relief to this large number of disaster victims. The Department of Industry has already been abolished, and the party fees of various counties have also been suspended for three months from September 1st. The Ministry of Military Affairs previously handed the Jinan Arsenal over to the province for management because of inconvenience. Now, in order to save expenses, the provincial government is still planning to ask the Ministry of Military Affairs to take it over and has already telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang to discuss this matter. The merger of the local militias and the public security bureaus is also under study because the nature of the police and the militias is not very different. It is planned to implement this first in the disaster-stricken counties.</p>

<h3>Bird's-eye View of the Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Director of Education He Siyuan and aviator Sun Tonggang once again flew over the disaster area in western Shandong at 11:30 AM today (the 26th) to inspect the situation. They returned to Jinan at 4:00 PM to report to Han Fuju. According to He Siyuan, they flew southwest today, but the sky was still cloudy and foggy, and the weather was bad, so they could not fly high. After reaching Dongping, they saw that the water in Dongping Lake was overflowing, and dozens of villages were submerged, which was not very serious. From Dongping, they flew to Yuncheng and Juye. The water between Yuncheng and Juye was very large, connecting Juye with the yellow water of Juancheng, forming a boundless expanse of water. Juye was still surrounded by water. Only a section of the Caoji Highway was still in good condition, while the rest was submerged. After one and a half hours, they arrived at Dingtao, where there was water to the east of the county seat. Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at Caoxian, where the water was originally high. Now, the river</p>
<p>water has returned to the old course of the Yellow River south of the city. Although the water has receded, the autumn crops in the fields have all died. Twenty minutes later, they arrived at Chengwu, where the water was also high before, but now it is gradually receding, and the autumn crops have also all died. (26th)</p>
<p>Relief Efforts for the Henan Flood Disaster</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Association Allocates Funds for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Requests the Provincial Government to Exempt Disaster Areas from Grain Taxes</p>
<p>A dispatch from Kaifeng states that the autumn flood season has not yet passed, and the Yellow River disaster is still worrying. However, the water level has gradually begun to recede in recent days, and the people of Bianliang are greatly relieved, and are working hard on disaster relief and rehabilitation. The Provincial Relief Association recently managed to allocate 9,000 yuan in relief funds, which were distributed as follows: 800 yuan to Kaifeng, 1,000 yuan to Lanfeng, 1,000 yuan to Kaocheng, 1,200 yuan to Fengqiu, 1,400 yuan to Huaxian, 800 yuan to Wuzhi, 800 yuan to Wenxian, 1,000 yuan to Mengjin, and 1,000 yuan to Sishui. This is considered a drop in the bucket. Yesterday, the association held an emergency meeting and decided to request the provincial government to exempt the flooded areas from grain taxes on tidal lands, and to request Liu Zhi to send a telegram to the National Government, Chairman Chiang, and the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee to allocate funds for emergency relief. At 9:00 AM on the same day, a temporary meeting of the Henan Provincial Yellow River Flood Prevention was held in the Construction Department. More than ten people attended, including Chen Panling, a member of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Construction Department, Li Peiji, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Zhang Guangyu, President of Henan University, and Chen Ruzhen, Director of the River Affairs Bureau. They discussed each item according to the topics submitted by Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Chen Committee, and resolved the following cases: ㈠ Regarding the conscription of manpower, the resolution was as follows: technical personnel, soldiers, and laborers are each divided into two types: fixed and temporary. 1. Fixed technical personnel are the technical personnel of the River Affairs Bureau, and temporary technical personnel are temporarily transferred from the local engineering agencies. 2. Fixed soldiers are the flood control soldiers of the River Affairs Bureau, and temporary soldiers are the local garrison troops. 3. Fixed laborers are the flood control teams of the River Affairs Bureau, and temporary laborers are conscripted from the common people in the counties along the river. ㈡ Regarding the source of financial resources, the resolution was as follows: the River Affairs Bureau's annual project fee of 100,000 yuan will be directly allocated by the Finance Department. If temporary matters occur,</p>
<p>even if the provincial treasury is stretched, the amount of funds that can be allocated is very small, and the central government should make overall plans to increase financial resources. ㈢ Regarding the strength of the provincial government, the resolution was as follows: all income in the province is submitted to the General Headquarters of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces for disposal, and there are no surplus funds for flood prevention. ㈣ Regarding the mining and transportation of stone, the resolution was as follows: 1. Currently, the source of stones is transported by ship to various embankment sections for application. 2. In the future, for the convenience of transportation, it is planned to build more than 200 li of light rail along the embankment to facilitate transportation. ㈤ Regarding the post-disaster handling of breaches, the</p>
<p>resolution was as follows: the opinions on post-disaster handling of breaches drafted by the Construction Department will be used as the standard, and the River Affairs Bureau will investigate and supplement the extent of damage and the location of damage to the dam. ㈥ Regarding fundamental solutions, the resolution was as follows: all the proposals submitted by the Construction Department today will be summarized as proposals of this meeting. ㈦ The Construction Department approved a letter from the Provincial Government Secretariat,</p>
<p>submitted by the Chairman, regarding Wang Yingyu and Xu Xinwu's proposal on repairing the long dike at the river mouth to support electricity, and submitted it to the River Affairs Bureau and the Construction Department for research and reply. The resolution was as follows: 1. The funds from the upper reaches should still be used for blocking and repairing the upper reaches of the river defense. 2.</p>
<p>This time, the breach in Changyuan in the lower reaches, while the upper reaches of Wenzhou and Lanfeng are still in emergency, which shows that dredging the sea mouth is not of much benefit to the upper reaches</p>
<p>river defense. 3. Tongwaxiang should be repaired, but the funds cannot be used entirely in one place. 4. There is a sense of urgency, and the sea mouth should be dredged, but it is not urgent. Now we must first save the dangerous places, and the Yellow River south bank should give priority to the Rongze Min Dike, Rongze Sluice, Zhongmu Zhong Sluice Lower Sluice, Heigang Lanfeng Leiji, and the abandoned dike of the old course of the Yellow River east of Leiji, totaling about 300 li in length. No matter where the breach occurs, it can divert water into the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The north bank should give priority to the Wenxian Min Dike and the Wuzhi Dike, because if a breach occurs here, the Yellow River can divert water into the Wei River and the sea. The above is extremely important. Once a breach occurs, not only will the people suffer, but the Jianghuai project will be completely abandoned. (26th)</p>
<p>Eradicating the Red Bandits:</p>
<h3>Magic Weapons and Principles</h3>
<p>Chiang's Admonishment to the Military Officer Corps in Lushan</p>
<p>Urging to Make All Soldiers Understand</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that Chairman Chiang, stationed in Lushan for a month, is actively planning the suppression of bandits. According to Chairman Xiong of the Provincial Government in the Joint Suppression Meeting, Chiang has a complete plan for the suppression of bandits. According to the announcement of the highest military organ, the most important things for the bandit suppression army in the future are: ㈠ Revitalize the spirit of modern new soldiers, sweep away the decadent and timid atmosphere, and implement the principle that there must be brave men under heavy rewards. In the future, the pensions for officers and soldiers killed or disabled will be issued as soon as they arrive, and there will be no shortage. A pension office will be set up in the headquarters to take charge of the matter. ㈢ The people take food as their heaven, and the soldiers take salaries as their lives. At the military and bandit suppression meetings held in Lushan before and after, there was a strict reorganization of the army's finances. In the future, each department will follow the prescribed expenses and issue them on time, without missing a penny. ㈣ When the National Army launched the Northern Expedition in the past, the reason why it was victorious in every battle was that the vertical and horizontal joint responsibility method was the most effective. In the vertical aspect, if the squad leader dies and the soldiers of the entire squad retreat, they will all be killed without mercy. This applies to the battalion, regiment, brigade, division, army, and road. In the horizontal aspect, if the departments advancing at the same time fail, and the other departments do not rescue them, they will also be killed without mercy. Chiang takes this as the life of the battle and has repeatedly ordered to seriously implement it, and will never be lenient. In addition, search, contact,</p>
<p>reconnaissance, vigilance, cover, observation, etc. are the six main factors in military affairs, and it has been ordered to all departments to implement them. It is heard that Chiang mentioned the above four items as four magic weapons and six items as six principles when he addressed the military officer corps on a moonlit night in Lushan, urging the trainees to instill them into all soldiers so that everyone can deeply understand them and earnestly implement them.

<p>Guangdong and Fujian Armies:</p>
<h3>Joint Suppression of Bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>Discussing Plans to Contact and Encircle Bandit Towns</p>
<p>Garrisons in Shanghang and Xinfeng Repeatedly Defeat Bandit Forces</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou states that since the communist bandits in western Fujian recklessly disturbed Liancheng, large groups have recently gathered between Changting and Huichang. In addition, the red puppet Twelfth Army is stationed between Yihuang and Dong'an, the puppet First Army Corps is distributed in the Xin'gan Qinzhou Niaojiang area, the puppet Third Army is scattered east of Dong'an, and the puppet Fifth Army Corps is still gathered in Mushan Yongfeng and other places. The puppet independent Sixth and Third Divisions and the Model Regiment are assembled at Yunmenling. The bandits in western Fujian are the Peng Dehuai and Luo Binghui factions. Peng Luo now intends to unite the puppet Twelfth Army Corps in Shicheng Ruijin Changting with the Ye Jianying faction of bandits in Yunmenling Huichang Chengjiang to break through, so the situation in southwestern Fujian has become tense again in recent days. Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army recently discussed joint suppression methods with Huang Renhuan, commander of the Second Column of Guangdong. It has now been decided to use eight divisions of the Guangdong and Fujian armies to attack the main bandit area of Changting.</p>
<p>In the Jiangxi border area, the South Road Bandit Suppression Army has successively replenished its military supplies and first searched for nearby remnants. Chen Shuyiao's 3rd Regiment of the Huang Division stationed in Shanghang discovered more than 1,000 bandits in Panjingxu on the 17th of this month, attempting to seize food. Chen's regiment intercepted them and killed more than ten bandits, and the remaining bandits fled north. In addition, the bandits in Yunmenling in southern Jiangxi recently attempted to attack Xinfeng City, but were defeated by Li Zhenqiu's division of the First Column. On the 16th of this month, more than 800 local soldiers gathered at Dugukeng, seven miles southwest of Ganzhou, plotting wrongdoing. Ye Gengchang's regiment of the First Army sent a team to suppress them, and the fighting was fierce. The puppet regiment leader of the bandit army died in the chaos. Ye Zhao, commander of the Second Division, sent a telegram saying that according to a telegram from Ye, the regiment leader, about eight hundred bandits had gathered in Dugukeng, seven miles away from Ganzhou, plotting wrongdoing. He personally led three battalions and an artillery company at noon on the same day to encircle and suppress them in three directions. The bandits used trenches to resist the battle. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to hold on and fled to the nearby Xianghantan. More than 300 bandits were killed, and the puppet Red Guard Regiment leader Ren Yingxian was killed in the chaos. Eight male and female bandits were captured, and 98 rifles and various powder drugs were seized. Our army also suffered slight casualties. The area is now garrisoned by Chen Huchen's battalion to reorganize the area. (August 22nd)</p>
<p>Hubei Province</p>
<h3>Completion of the Embankment Fund Clearance</h3>
<p>The Total Amount of Encroachment is Nearly 700,000</p>
<p>Chiang Orders the Arrest of a Large Number of Corrupt Personnel</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that the Hubei embankment funds have not been cleared for several years, and encroachment and misappropriation have been regarded as common practice. When the flood occurred the year before last, this secret was completely revealed. When Commander-in-Chief Chiang was stationed in Hankou, he executed Liu Wenjin, who had encroached on embankment funds, and strictly ordered all agencies to quickly return the borrowed funds. In order to thoroughly clear the matter, the Hubei Water Conservancy Embankment Project Affairs Clearance Committee was specially organized, with Li Shucheng, Zhu Jiuying, Wu Guozhen, Wang Jinzhi, Xi Debing, and Cheng Wenxun as members responsible for the entire clearance. The work has now been completed. It is estimated that from the 15th year to the 21st year, the income of the embankment funds totaled more than 19 million yuan. On the expenditure side, more than 12.7 million yuan was used for embankments, 1 million yuan for administrative expenses of the two bureaus of water conservancy and embankment projects, 400,000 yuan for embankment donation collection and storage fees, and 4.6 million yuan for embezzlement by various agencies, as well as the bankruptcy of the Central Bank in the 16th year and public debt tickets. The amount left is very small. The committee finished cleaning up</p>
<p>and immediately sent the deputy director Zhu Jiuying to Xun to report to Chiang, and submitted opinions on improving the embankment and the facts of encroachment by the collectors for review. Chiang was satisfied and will issue an order to commend all members of the committee. Its outstanding employees will be assigned to various agencies in Hubei and Anhui provinces and the engineering office of the National Economic Commission, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and other places, respectively. At the same time, improvement opinions were handed over to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for serious handling. As for the cases of embezzlement of embankment funds, there are as many as 28 cases, and the total amount of encroachment is nearly 700,000 yuan. Chiang specifically ordered the arrest of all criminals and severely punished them according to law. The order stated, "According to the report from the Hubei Water Conservancy Embankment Project Affairs Clearance Committee, it was found that the Hubei embankment funds have never been fixed. In the spring of the 16th year, local legal groups in the province, in view of the frequent floods and the importance of embankments, jointly submitted a proposal that was discussed and decided by the joint meeting of the central party and government agencies to levy embankment donations under the customs taxes of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and the special taxes, field taxes, and transit taxes within Hubei, for the purpose of building Hubei embankments, and to set up a management committee to be responsible for the storage and storage of special funds, which are not allowed to be misappropriated. The intention is good. Only because these donations were collected by various collection agencies at that time, and the management committee had no power to supervise and audit, arrears were incurred, and cases of encroachment and misappropriation occurred frequently. In addition to Mao Zhongcai, the supervisor of Changyue Pass, and Yang Ren, the director of the Changyue Pass embankment donation collection, who embezzled embankment funds and escaped without a trace, the case was serious, and the Ministry of Finance has issued a general order to strictly arrest them. Secondly, there are cases such as Chen Xin and Wu Jie, directors of the Yichang Kou 25 Inland Revenue Bureau, and Song Yingzhong, director of the Hubei Provincial Anti-Smoking Office, with a large amount of deficit. For the rest, such as field taxes and transit taxes, the county magistrates and directors of the finance bureaus of various counties, and the directors of various collection bureaus, who have deficits or misappropriated donations, range from more than ten thousand. Later, the Bao Wei Committee reorganized the Management Committee, expanding its powers. Although the previous arrears were investigated and pursued in separate cases, due to the long history, changes in personnel, or unknown whereabouts, or unresolved disputes, or unapprehended wanted criminals, or uncollected orders, there were few cases that were resolved. After the establishment of this committee, it cleared the accounts one by one, and issued separate orders to urge the accounts, and repeatedly published the names and deficits of the officials in the newspapers, and ordered them to surrender and clear the accounts within a time limit. There are still many that have been shelved and ignored. As this committee is about to end, it is difficult to delay any longer. It was decided at the 15th meeting of this committee to submit a clear list of the major cases of private embezzlement and encroachment, and request the military and political authorities to strictly arrest and investigate them by name, so as to serve as a warning to others. According to this, the cases of encroachment on additional embankment donations listed in the list amounted to as many as 28, and the amount of embankment funds in arrears was more than 680,000 yuan. Such corruption and favoritism, and disregarding laws and regulations,</p>
<p>if they are not severely punished, how can they warn against greed and evil, and rectify customs? According to the previous report, it is appropriate to copy the clear list and order the subordinates to seriously arrest and investigate the cases by name without any favoritism. This order." (August 26th)</p>
<p>Conclusion of the Investigation of the Wuchang Gold Digging Case</p>
<p>The Parties in Question Make Their Final Arguments</p>
<p>Peng Younan and Peng Shisun Taken into Custody</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that the Wuchang Gold Digging Investigation Committee has concluded its investigation into the case of Kong Geng accusing Peng Younan of stealing buried gold, after holding fifteen meetings and conducting thorough investigations. On the 26th, the committee held its sixteenth meeting, summoning both parties and all relevant persons for a public debate. The members Yu Jushen, Xu Chongren, Yan Guyi, Guo Maolian, Yao Zuqing, Chen Bangben, Yang Xiwu, and Liu Chongyan, the parties Kong Geng, Kong Yansun, Peng Younan, and Peng Shisun, and the relevant persons Tao Shaolian, Li Changhe, Zheng Choubao, Guo Jingcheng, and Zheng Wenqing were all present. As it was the final debate, there was almost no space in the gallery. Before the meeting, a preparatory meeting was held to discuss the time frame, scope, and methods of the debate. Then the meeting officially began. First, the relevant persons Li Changhe (Li was the first worker to discover the buried gold and had fled to avoid trouble, but recently came to the case), Tao Shaolian, Zheng Choubao, Guo Jingcheng, Zheng Wenqing, and Wei Chunting gave statements describing the discovery and transportation of the gold. The main points were: ㈠ The dug-up silver included both small ingots and large ingots, which differed from Peng's admission that there were only small ingots. ㈡ Three boxes of buried silver were carried out, which did not match Peng's statement of two boxes. ㈢ The location of the buried gold was indeed in Kong Geng's residence. ㈣ Li Changhe's recanted statement was written by Peng Shisun. The Kong and Peng parties then engaged in a fierce debate that lasted for a long time. The investigation committee then announced the end of the debate and, based on the facts of the investigation, determined that Peng Younan was indeed highly suspected of theft and property damage, and that Peng Shisun was also involved in colluding to give false evidence and conspiring to conceal stolen goods. It was resolved that the principal offender Peng Younan and the accomplice Peng Shisun should be sent to the Garrison Command's Military Law Department for detention, and the investigation process should be reported to the Police Department for a final verdict.

<h3>Inspection of Corpses Ends in Drowning Tragedy</h3>
<p>Dai Qinsheng's son, named Wei Yun, married into the Chen family in Yexie Town in the past. The couple were still harmonious and had two sons and a daughter. However, Wei Yun recently suffered from mental illness, and there were occasional quarrels between the couple. On the 23rd of this month, Wei Yun left alone, and his family did not suspect anything at first. However, on the evening of the 24th, a man from Deshenggang came to the town to report that a floating body was found at the mouth of the Beiyanjing River. The clothes and appearance were similar to Wei Yun. The Chens went to investigate after hearing the news, but the body had already drifted elsewhere. On the morning of the 25th, the body was found in the west of Zhangze Port. At the same time, Dai Qinsheng and his wife also heard the news and rushed to the scene. After inspecting the deceased, it was indeed their son. They immediately went to the Songjiang County Court Procuratorate to report the incident and request an inspection. Prosecutor Zhu, accompanied by forensic officer Wang, went to inspect the body. It was confirmed that he had fallen into the river and died before his death. The family of the deceased signed a statement and prepared a coffin for collection. At the time of the inspection, there was a sea of people. A farmer named Shi from the opposite port intended to watch from the Sihe River and also drowned. The family of the deceased then fished out the body and requested that it be exempted from inspection. The body was carried back for burial.</p>
<h3>Henan Refugees Enter the Area and Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>More than 600 refugees, men and women, young and old, from Shangcheng County, Henan Province, led by Liu Baiyin, Liu Jinchen, Zhang Fudang, Mei Shaochen, and Liu Yuanxiang, came to Songjiang. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to suppress them, and at the same time provided some travel expenses and food rations to order them to leave the area. However, the refugee leader Liu Baiyin carried a passport and went to various agencies to donate funds, and even the town office could not avoid it. Today, he went to various shops in the west to donate funds, extorting from house to house, saying that it was impossible without one yuan per household, which almost caused a conflict with the merchants. Patrol Chief Wang Guohua of the Second District Police Station brought his subordinates after hearing the news.</p>

<h3>Three People Struck and Killed by Lightning</h3>
<p>The fourteenth district of the county borders Taihu Lake, and Wu is an important port on the lake. Many fishing boats in the lake are docked there. At about 3 pm the day before yesterday, thunder suddenly struck the sky. Jiang Hongxing's brother and his wife and son were fishing. The thunderstorm came suddenly, and they stopped fishing and sat in the middle cabin among the boatmen. Unexpectedly, with a thunderous sound, the couple were attracted to the bow of the boat by the electricity and killed. His son, a certain Jia, was on the boat and suddenly disappeared. It is thought that he was also killed by lightning and the body was gone. A sail was also burned by lightning. This is also strange.</p>

<h3>A Vendetta Case Occurs in the Eighteenth District</h3>
<p>Pan Bajin, of Qinjiabian, Guxia Township, 18th District of Wuyi, suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door late on the 26th. When he went out to open the bolt to investigate, he saw four flashlights shining brightly. Two thugs armed with sharp blades faced him and hacked at him. He couldn't avoid it for a while, and half of his left ear was cut off. Bajin endured the pain and ran into the bedroom. The thugs chased him closely, dragged Bajin out from under the bed, and stabbed him more than ten times. Bajin fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs went out and fled. Bajin was still able to speak after the thugs left, and died at dawn. The 4th Branch of the Public Security Bureau heard the story, and reported to the County Court to send someone to inspect the body. On the 27th, Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi led his staff to investigate the body in order to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Residents of Yilin Town Move Away to Avoid Bandits</h3>
<p>Yilin Town, a prosperous commercial town in Funing, was looted by the bandits Zhang Zigao and others from Lianshui, and more than 100 men and women were kidnapped. After the military and police encircled and suppressed them, many bandits were killed on the spot and the hostages were rescued. However, rumors have been circulating in the town for the past few days that the bandits will come back for revenge. Although there are military and police stationed there, the people have become alarmed. Moreover, most of the shops have not been able to resume business, and they are in dire straits. As a result, many people have moved away in the past two days, either to this city or to Yancheng, to avoid the bandits.</p>

<h3>Two Robbers Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Office executed a bandit each yesterday (27th) in the morning and afternoon. One was Han A'chang (also known as Han Changlin), a habitual bandit from Sheng County, who used the alias Shi Rongbiao, also known as Wang Yunbiao. In the 19th year, he attempted to kidnap and intimidate Wang Yurun in Gaofeng Village, Sheng County, but failed, and burned down his buildings. He also kidnapped Xu Xiangrong from Renwu Village and obtained a ransom. He then used the ransom to defraud his clansman Han Xizao and others. When he was on the run, he obtained 1,000 yuan in stolen money. He was captured by detectives in Jiaxing. During the interrogation, he confessed without hesitation and was sentenced to death. He was escorted to Qingbomen outside the city at 9 am yesterday and executed by firing squad. The other was Gao Yongpu, a robber who was captured on the spot at Erbao, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway outside Qingtaimen in Hangzhou City at 10 am on the 26th. After being arrested, he confessed that he was from Hebei, 22 years old, and had served as a first-class soldier in the 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, 184th Regiment of the 21st National Army. He was eliminated during the strict reorganization, and then killed the company commander with his companion using a wooden shell gun, and came to Zhejiang. The day before yesterday, he arrived in Hangzhou via Xiaoshan and robbed a merchant, Fang Jinfu, of 14 yuan in silver and 17 cents in small silver. After the arrest, he confessed directly and was identified by the victim. At 4 pm yesterday, he was escorted by the Security Office to the place where the incident occurred outside Qingtaimen and executed by firing squad. When he was escorted, he was given steamed buns and liquor. He then boarded a rickshaw and was escorted by military police inspection teams and patrol teams. About 40,000 to 50,000 people watched along the way through Yingzi Road and Xinmin Road. When he arrived at the scene of the incident, it was already past 5 o'clock. He died after being shot three times.</p>

Old passenger permits will not be valid.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xue Dubi and Huang Shaogu Visited Him</p>
<p>Planning to Draft a Long Letter of Suggestions to Chiang</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Li Liejun, who had gone to Lushan at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to discuss the aftermath of the Chahar Province incident, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m. on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Kungwo ship. After landing at the Hongkou Wharf, he went directly to his private residence on Route Massenet to rest. At 3:30 p.m., Xue Dubi, Huang Shaogu, and Zeng visited him together. Li told our reporter yesterday that he plans to first send a representative to Lu to meet with Feng, and he himself will not leave Shanghai for the time being. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Meeting with Chiang</h3>
<p>After going to Lushan at the beginning of the month, Li met with Chairman Chiang four times at Lushan at Chiang's invitation. In addition to discussing the aftermath of the Chahar Province incident, he also presented his ideas for saving the country. He also met with President Wang, President Sun, and others to discuss all important issues. Li's trip was accompanied by his secretary Zhang Mi-gong, and five family members, including sons and daughters. They left Lushan on the 23rd to Jiujiang, stayed in Jiujiang for two days, and took a ship east from Jiujiang on the 25th. They arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chiang's Concern for the Country</h3>
<p>Our reporter visited Li at his residence on Route Massenet yesterday afternoon to discuss current affairs. Li was deeply moved by the difficult times and said that he had met with Chairman Chiang in Gan many times. Chiang was deeply concerned about the country and worked tirelessly. I plan to rest in Shanghai for a day or two and draft a long letter of suggestions to Chiang as a guide for planning the country. As for Mr. Feng Huanzhang's reputation, as Mr. Sun Zhesheng said, the Central Government intends to appoint him as the Army Inspector or Water Conservancy Director. If it comes from sincerity, I believe Feng will accept it. I am staying in Shanghai for personal matters and will not go elsewhere for the time being. I plan to first send a representative to Lu to meet with Feng.</p>
<h3>Written Statement</h3>
<p>Li also issued a written statement yesterday as follows: The peaceful negotiations regarding the Chahar Province incident have become a thing of the past. However, Feng Huanzhang's sending of a proclamation to recover the four counties and his battle to capture Dolon should be recorded by future historians. Although the government seemed to be using a large army to pressure Zhangjiakou, it was not really the case, which would be a historical shame. I also discussed the Chahar Province incident and Mr. Feng's actions during my time in the mountains, but what I focused on was still realizing democracy, clarifying the administration of government, and perfecting national defense. Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang generally agreed, but although they intended to implement them, they have not yet found the right way. Mr. Chiang's spirit is as good as ever, and he is extremely concerned about national affairs, which shows his hard work. On the way, I saw reports that Japan is obsessed with aggression and is determined to innovate. The people in our government should wake up even more. I have matters at home, so I will not leave Shanghai for the time being. I will send a representative to Mr. Feng first to express my admiration.</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang Fu and others strongly urged Ma to take a position in the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Ma said he would decide after his subordinates were settled</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese hero General Ma Zhanshan, who had previously gone to Hangzhou with Deputy Commander Zhang Dianjiu and others on the 23rd of last month due to the hot weather in Shanghai, and then went to Moganshan to escape the summer heat, has been there for more than a month. Now, because Finance Minister Song Ziwen is scheduled to return to China from the United States tomorrow, he returned to Shanghai by car from Hangzhou at 1:10 p.m. yesterday to welcome him. According to Ma's representative Wu Huanzhang, who spoke to the New News Agency reporter, those who accompanied General Ma to Shanghai yesterday, in addition to Ma himself, included Chief of Staff Jiang Songnian, myself (Wu), and two adjutants, a total of five people. Deputy Commander Zhang (Dianjiu) and Director Zhou (Weitai) are scheduled to come to Shanghai by night train from Hangzhou today. We took two cars from Hangzhou at 7:30 a.m. this morning and arrived in Shanghai at 1:10 p.m. The journey took about six hours. General Ma felt a little tired due to the bumpy road and long travel time today, so he returned to his private residence to rest after arriving in Shanghai. Regarding General Ma's strong refusal to take a position in the Military Affairs Commission, after Chairman Huang (Yingbai) of the Pingzheng Committee and myself strongly urged him on the mountain, Ma has said that he will consider and decide after his subordinates have been settled. Regarding the donation incident involving Generals Li (Du) and Zhu (Ziqiao), it is said that Ma recently telegraphed Li, expressing his absolute support for the investigation, but mainly that they should remain silent during the investigation period to avoid discouraging patriotic compatriots. The results of the investigation will be published in detail in the newspapers to show credibility.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Speech</h3>
<p>The Central Government will convene a meeting after Song's arrival</p>
<p>Loans for cotton and wheat will definitely not be used for military and political expenses</p>
<p>President of the Central Bank Kong Xiangxi, who went to Gan to meet with Chairman Chiang, returned to Shanghai after finishing his business the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, Kong met with the reporter of the New Voice News Agency at his residence and made the following statement:</p>
<h3>Trip was Quite Successful</h3>
<p>Kong first answered the reporter's question and said that his trip to Gan to discuss the financial and other issues that he had recently been assisting the financial authorities with was quite successful. Before Finance Minister Song Ziwen returns to Shanghai, I will temporarily assist the financial authorities. According to reports, Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin visited Kong at 11:30 a.m. yesterday and talked for about half an hour to report on financial issues to Song.</p>
<h3>Not for Military and Political Expenses</h3>
<p>The outside world has paid close attention to the use of the 50 million US dollars in cotton and wheat loans, and there has been much speculation. Kong stated on this matter that Chairman Chiang advocated that the loan should be used for production and definitely not for military and political expenses. President Wang of the Executive Yuan also agreed with this view. Our suggestions for this loan are also mainly for production, so as to restore the backward production industry in China.</p>
<h3>Important Meeting to be Convened</h3>
<p>Regarding the Central Government's plan to convene an important meeting after Finance Minister Song's arrival to discuss foreign finance and domestic issues, Kong said that this is a natural move. Song will have a considerable report at that time. The meeting will be held in Nanjing, not in Lushan. However, after Song arrives in Shanghai, he will go to Lushan to report to Chiang on the trip.</p>
<h3>Technical Cooperation</h3>
<p>Regarding the technical cooperation issue that Finance Minister Song recently obtained from the League of Nations, this was an event that occurred three years ago. The League of Nations had previously sent personnel to China to investigate, including Health Representative Rixman, Transportation Representative Haas, and Financial Representative Dr. Treat. After completing the investigation and returning to Europe, they took advantage of Song's trip to Europe to discuss how to handle it. Therefore, this matter is not newly established, but a rehash of an old matter. After the investigation, the second step of work will be carried out. Japan has no reason or need to oppose it.</p>
<h3>Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>The Nine-Nation Silver Agreement signed by Finance Minister Song at the World Economic Conference is very beneficial to us. The agreement will take effect on January 1 next year. All countries concerned, no matter what, should ratify it and notify the United States before that day. After it takes effect in the future, the price of silver is expected to increase, and there will be certain restrictions on the sale of silver abroad. Countries that produce silver will try to buy it, so the price of silver will have the possibility of increasing.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Progressing Well</h3>
<p>Kong also talked about the bandit suppression issue, saying that it has made considerable progress recently. Since Chiang established an officer training class in Gan and provided considerable training, this work has been particularly effective. As for the assassination of Xiong Shihui, the chairman of Gan Province, it did not happen. I did not hear of this rumor in Lushan, but only heard of it after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Many Books Have Been Solicited for the International Library</p>
<p>The Date of Departure Is Not Yet Finalized and Will Have to Wait Until the End of the Year</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Central Committee Member Li Shizeng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. The reporter visited him at his residence and was told that he returned to China this time to solicit books and members for the establishment of the China International Library. Although many books have been solicited and sent one after another, it is not yet possible to declare it over. The regular meetings of the International Cultural Association, scheduled for July and September, could not be attended as scheduled. The next meeting will be held at the end of this year, so the date of departure will probably be at the end of this year. He then talked about the recent situation of the China Branch of the International Cultural Association and the preparations for the China International Library. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>International Cultural Association: The headquarters of the International Cultural Association is located in Geneva. Each member country has a branch, with the purpose of exchanging and studying the culture of various countries. More than 30 countries have joined. Our country has recently joined and established a preparatory committee, with Mr. Wu Zhihui as the chairman. The preparatory committee held a meeting here a month ago to discuss soliciting members and other matters, which has now begun. The nature of the branches in various countries is different. Some are organized by the government, and some are initiated by the people, while our country will complete its mission with the guidance of the government and the enthusiastic participation of the academic community.</p>
<p>International Library: The China International Library is organized in imitation of the German Cultural Research Institute. Bell, the deputy dean of the institute, once organized a cultural survey team to China for investigation. Since the library is an international organization, its members will be sought from celebrities in the academic circles of various countries and scholars with a keen interest in Sinology. The number of members is set at 300, and the annual membership fee is 400 yuan. The library is located in Geneva and displays Chinese books published in ancient and modern times for research and reference for students studying abroad and specialists. I returned to China this time entirely to solicit books. Because it has not yet been completed, I have not gone to Europe yet. The total number of members who have been solicited is also unknown.</p>
<p>Lord Marley, Chairman of the Anti-War Conference</p>
<h3>Talked to the Press</h3>
<p>This Conference Has Absolutely No Communist Undertones</p>
<p>The Date and Location of the Meeting Have Not Been Determined</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Lord Marley, chairman of the Anti-War Conference, met with journalists at the hotel yesterday (26th) afternoon and strongly denied the impression that the upcoming United Anti-War Front Congress was initiated and hosted by the Third International, saying that this conference has absolutely no communist undertones. Each representative is a solid unit and is determined to promote an ideology, namely, opposition to war. The reason for choosing to hold the meeting in Shanghai is that this area is the most dangerous in terms of war. He visited the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Peier, and the Chief Accountant, Mr. Feixin Dun, yesterday morning, but it was only a general visit and he had not yet submitted a request for permission to hold the meeting. The conference was originally scheduled to be held from September 3rd to 5th for three days, but it has now been postponed indefinitely, because its date and location cannot be determined until the exact number of attendees is known. The number of attendees may be as few as 20 or as many as 2,000, which is also unknown. Marley also denied that Ms. Song Qingling, the chairman of the preparatory committee, will be the chairman of the congress, saying that she will chair the congress and expressed that he will visit Mayor Wu and the consuls of various countries in the coming days, and plans to visit Beijing to visit important figures in the Chinese government, persuading them not to take actions that hinder the holding of the meeting in China, and said that our first step must be to try to dispel all parties' narrow-mindedness about the meeting, and only this matter may take one or two months to succeed.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongjie Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Liu Jie, the former Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, will soon take office as the Minister to Germany, while Liu Wendao, the former Minister to Germany, will be transferred to the Minister to Italy. Both countries are currently being consulted for their consent. Once consent is obtained, it can be officially announced. Liu has completed the handover of his duties as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He took the night train to Shanghai the night before last and arrived here at about 8 a.m. yesterday, and immediately returned to his residence to rest. Liu came here to welcome Finance Minister Song's return to the country and decided to stay in Shanghai to rest temporarily. Once the official announcement of the foreign minister is made, he will go abroad to take office.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs</p>
<h3>Dismissed All Clerks</h3>
<p>Implicated in Corruption by Subordinates</p>
<p>More Than Fifty Were All Dismissed</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs clerks Shi Cunciao, Wei Anxiang, Zhang Qiutao, Chen Zhongshan, and others, falsely established a joint company, illegally printed fake seals, reduced the estimated value of green and white import tax bills, and colluded with customs declarers of various foreign firms to commit fraud. The police have already arrested the corrupt clerks and sent them to the court. At the same time, the court is investigating and prosecuting the customs declarers of various foreign firms who colluded in the fraud. The Ministry of Finance has thoroughly investigated the case and ordered the customs to dismiss all the clerks (i.e., subordinates) to reform and rectify the situation. The results of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Details of the Fraud</h3>
<p>The General Affairs Section and the Inspection Section of the Jianghai Customs employed a total of 59 clerks, who were in charge of various affairs. In the previous fraud case, Shi Cunciao, Wang Yueren, Shen Guozhang, Zhang Qiutao, and other seven people who had been arrested and sent to the court were mostly working in the seal management department. These clerks often gathered with the customs declarers of various foreign firms, which led to the occurrence of illegal activities. Now, a few people have implicated the entire group. Those who committed fraud deserve their punishment, but those who were implicated are suffering.</p>
<h3>Order to Dismiss</h3>
<p>After this case occurred, the Central Government immediately advocated strict handling. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has ordered the strict investigation of accomplices among the arrested criminals and their detention and punishment. At the same time, it has discussed with the Tax Affairs Department to fundamentally reform the clerk system and strictly prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. As a result of the consultation, it was decided to dismiss all the clerks in the General Affairs and Inspection Sections. The duties of the clerks should be taken over by new people hired by the customs. The Ministry of Finance's instructions to dismiss the clerks were officially announced by the Jianghai Customs last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Payment for Dismissal</h3>
<p>Among the 59 dismissed clerks, six or seven were guaranteed by Westerners working in the Jianghai Customs, who said that these people were diligent in their service and of good character, so they were allowed to stay, but were reassigned to work in other sections. In addition to paying wages to the other dismissed clerks, they were still given severance pay in accordance with the customs regulations, based on their age of entry into the customs and years of service, to show preferential treatment, considering that they were innocent and implicated. As the Ministry's order was concerned, they could only obey the order to receive the money and hand over their duties, and were scheduled to leave the customs today (Monday).</p>
<h3>Hire Child Labor</h3>
<p>To fill the vacancies left by the dismissal of the customs clerks, the method was changed. Youths under the age of sixteen were recruited by the customs. Qualifications were stipulated, and they were admitted to the General Affairs and Inspection Sections to replace the duties of more than fifty clerks. Child labor is pure in heart, and assigning them to this position can avoid corruption. The Jianghai Customs has now begun recruiting child labor to enter the customs for training and service.</p>
<h3>Luodian Market Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Result of Mediation by Party and Government Committee Members</p>
<p>Luodian Town, which belongs to Baoshan County, caused a Luodian market storm in the whole town the day before yesterday because the county government issued a ban on shops hiring unscrupulous people to collect accounts in the countryside. After the county government sent Zhang, the chief of the Public Security Section, Chen Jiamo, a member of the County Party Department's Rectification Committee, and Liu Shouquan, a member of the Party Affairs Committee, to Luodian for mediation, the shops have all opened yesterday. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation of the Cause: After the three committee members Zhang, Chen, and Liu were dispatched to Luodian by County Magistrate Jin, the committee members immediately began investigating the cause of the strike. It was actually due to the people in the Fourth District Affairs Conference holding a meeting with private opinions while the district chief was out on official business. Among them, assistant Sun Yingfeng presided over the meeting, and the district chief, after returning to the district, did not investigate in detail and immediately approved it and reported it to the county government. The county government considered it a routine meeting and immediately issued a notice according to the case, making one mistake after another, which led to a huge wave. After learning about the situation, Chief Zhang and others urgently summoned all the merchants in the town in the town's Chamber of Commerce to explain the inappropriateness of the strike and promised to report back to the county magistrate and would definitely not lightly oppress the merchants according to the district office's request. The audience was quite moved, but some merchants left in a huff because the county government officials failed to truly accommodate all the points of their request and went to the People's Assembly Hall to hold a meeting, so Chairman Zhang and others could not get to the point. Then, they gathered the chief of the town's Public Security Bureau, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the town head of the town office, and the chairmen of the various guilds to hold a joint meeting and summoned Sun Yingfeng, an official of the district branch (i.e., the district office assistant who was criticized by the public), to the meeting to discuss together. They all said that the request to the county magistrate to withdraw the order was related to the county government's prestige and was difficult to comply with. Only another way could be found. The county government would issue another notice, stating that if there were stubborn debtors who refused to collect accounts on the grounds that the merchants hired opium addicts and beggars to collect accounts and tried to delay payment, the creditors would be allowed to list the amount owed and send it to the Public Security Bureau for assistance in recovery. It was also allowed to post the notice tomorrow (i.e., yesterday) morning as a guarantee for the merchants to collect accounts. As for Sun Yingfeng, who sowed discord, considering that his father's feelings were always good, no further discussion was made. District Chief Wang stated that there would definitely be no more disturbances in the district affairs meeting in the future. After the meeting was over, the resolutions were announced to the public, and the audience was satisfied. Then, the district chief, town head, and chairman of the Chamber of Commerce sent the resolutions to the shops and circulated them throughout the town. The shops began to open as usual yesterday, and a strike storm came to an end.</p>
<p>Aftermath: After the strike storm came to an end, some merchants gathered at the Chamber of Commerce and sternly questioned why the officials of the Chamber of Commerce and the Guilds accepted the proposal of the county's representatives without achieving the purpose of the request. The number of people reached more than 300, and the situation became serious again. Fortunately, a certain secretary gently persuaded them in public until more than 10 o'clock before they dispersed. Now, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the standing committee members intend to resign and no longer serve because their hard work is not understood by the public.</p>
<p>County Government Notices: The two county government notices before and after the event are recorded as follows, so that the reader can understand the whole story. 1. Notice before the event: Notice is hereby given. According to the report from Wang Qingtao, the district chief of the Fourth District, it was found that item 1 of the 34th District Affairs Conference was that opium addicts and beggars were hired to collect debts, which disturbed the neighborhood. A request was previously submitted to the county for prohibition. Now that it has been a long time and the practice has become entrenched, it should be requested to reiterate the previous order. It was resolved that the district office should submit a request to the county government to issue a strict prohibition notice and order the district offices, the Public Security Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce to jointly prohibit it. According to the record, it was found that opium addicts and beggars were hired to collect debts, shouting and disrupting, and becoming a common practice. Extortion was carried out in every possible way, and the victims suffered unspeakable pain. It had been resolved to request a prohibition in the past. Now it is resolved to follow up on the previous request. It is appropriate to submit a document to request approval for a strict prohibition notice and order the district offices, the Public Security Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce to jointly prohibit it in order to eliminate bad habits. Therefore, it is ordered that the district offices, the Public Security Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce strictly prohibit it and issue a notice for the merchants and people of the county to strictly abide by it. If anyone dares to violate it deliberately, they will be punished according to the law without leniency. This notice. 2. Notice after the event: Notice is hereby given. According to the report from Wang Wenxun, the acting chairman of the Luodian Chamber of Commerce, and the standing committee members Qian Yinwei, Yang Wenbing, and Gu Xiang, the district is unfortunately in a strike storm. Now, the county government has sent Chief Zhang, Standing Committee Member Liu of the Party Department, and Rectification Committee Member Chen to Luodian to earnestly persuade the merchants to resume business. Now, a method has been formulated, and the county government will issue another notice, stating that if there are stubborn debtors who refuse to collect accounts on the grounds that the merchants hire opium addicts and beggars and try to delay payment, the creditors should list the amount owed and send it to the Public Security Bureau for assistance in recovery. The above method has been drafted into a notice and posted in the town according to the agreement, and the shops have been advised to open first. It is appropriate to report the drafted method to the county magistrate for consideration, which is convenient for the public. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, a notice is hereby issued. From now on, all debtors should pay the account owed to the shops as scheduled in order to maintain credit. The shops should also handle the debt collection from debtors in accordance with proper procedures in order to prevent disputes. All should abide by this and not violate it. This notice. August 27th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang.</p>
<h3>Chuyu Warship Goes to Song Again for Gunnery Test</h3>
<p>The naval cruiser Chuyu had an accident during a gunnery test in Song last time, and He Erkun, a technician from the Ordnance Department, was injured and died on the spot. The gun that caused the accident has been dismantled by the Ordnance Department a few days ago and replaced with a new one. Now, in order to avoid danger, it is necessary to re-fire the newly installed gun to see if it is perfect. Therefore, the ship has sailed to Wusongkou outside yesterday morning and is scheduled to fire there in one or two days. If the results are perfect, it will sail to the capital.</p>

<h3>Twenty Million Coal Industry Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Entirely Used to Aid Production of Various Mines</p>
<p>Everything Must Wait Until Song Returns to the Country to Decide</p>
<p>It has long been rumored that a twenty million yuan national coal public bond will be issued. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Huang Zhongyin, secretary of the National Coal Association, who proposed the case, asking when it could be issued and what the collateral for the bond would be. According to him, the bond amount is twenty million yuan, all of which will be used to aid the production of various coal mines in China. The original plan included using some of the funds to add railway vehicles to ensure that coal transport would not be delayed. However, after the Ministry of Railways held a vehicle meeting in Beijing recently, this issue does not seem necessary at present, so it is still pending. In short, the bond plan has been submitted by the association to both the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, and is being considered for implementation. Everything must wait until Minister Song returns to the country to decide. As for the bond collateral, if it is issued in the future, it will be secured by the various coal mines in need of aid. It is found that there are very few large coal mines in the country, but there are many others that mine coal using indigenous methods. Among them, those in need of aid will be allocated funds, and those not in need will be left alone. At this time, no mine has been designated as needing aid, nor has any mine been designated as collateral for this bond, etc. Afterwards, the reporter learned from other sources that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo had repeatedly consulted with Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin to discuss the implementation. It is likely that after Finance Minister Song Ziwen returns to the country, there will be a definite decision.</p>
<h3>Draft Loan Agreement for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Ministry of Finance for Endorsement Yesterday</p>
<p>For the sake of developing business and expanding operations, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 600,000 British pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee. The committee has already approved it, and the draft agreement has been signed by the Boxer Indemnity Board, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Ministry of Transportation. Now only the Ministry of Finance has not signed. According to news from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Transportation specially sent three copies of the agreement to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting endorsement to finalize the matter. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Regarding the previous letter No. 40009 from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board, regarding the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowing money to expand shipping, the board has already passed a resolution at its 17th meeting, and immediately recorded and notified it. Now the draft loan agreement has been completed and signed by Vice Chairman Ma on behalf of the board. Accordingly, a letter is prepared and enclosed, requesting your ministry to examine and sign it, and instruct the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send it to the Ministry of Finance for successive endorsement. One copy should be issued to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and one copy should be returned to the board for separate filing. As for the brotherhood of officialdom, regarding the copy stipulated in Article 12 of the draft agreement, which should be sent to your ministry and the Ministry of Finance for filing, it will be sent separately by the board after the draft agreement is signed and returned, and a combined statement, etc. is made." Two copies of the draft were attached. This was approved. The draft agreement has been signed, sealed, and issued to the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for signing, sealing, and affixing the official seal. Now, a reply has been received stating that the signing and sealing have been completed, and the draft agreement is sent herewith. Please examine, endorse, and return it. As for the brotherhood of officialdom, etc.</p>
<h3>County Government Strictly Urges Payment of Overdue Land Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a public notice yesterday, saying: "According to Instruction No. 305 from the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Finance Department, it is hereby specially ordered that land tax is a major source of income for the provincial treasury and should be cleared annually according to regulations. However, recent investigations have revealed that the arrears accumulated in various counties are very large, and the new tax for the 21st year is also in arrears by more than two million yuan. Given the current financial difficulties and the urgent needs of the province, it is necessary to strictly urge collection to meet public needs. All new taxes for the 20th year must be collected in full by the end of September of this year, and cleared and reported without any shortage. In addition to issuing a general order, the county is ordered to make efforts to urge collection and report within the deadline. If any grain households resist or delay payment, a list of names should be opened for selection and arrest for severe punishment in the province. This order, etc., is hereby announced for general knowledge. All households with outstanding payments must pay them in full within the deadline. Households with old arrears before the 21st year should pay them in advance, and do not delay with the intention of procrastination because the provincial order does not mention it explicitly, lest you be investigated. Everyone must strictly abide by it. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Railways</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau to Rectify Freight Transportation</h3>
<p>To Plan and Improve the Equipment of the Makeng Road</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, saying: "The development of railway affairs depends entirely on the progress of business. But to seek the progress of business, we must first plan properly the methods, equipment, and management of passenger and freight transportation to achieve success. The railway is located in a prosperous area in the southeast, and passenger transportation is easy to develop. However, freight transportation is subject to competition from Yangtze River shipping. If we do not pay attention, we will easily lose a large amount of income. We should strive to find ways to facilitate transportation for merchants in order to attract them. However, according to investigations, the Makeng Road station, which has the busiest freight transportation on the railway, has not improved in terms of loading and unloading. In terms of warehouse management, the stored goods are often subject to spoilage, rat infestation, and theft, resulting in a loss of credibility, inconvenience in pledging loans, fear among merchants, hesitation, and a decline in freight transportation and income. The reason for this is all due to this. Recently, the railway has submitted a request to revise the contract for renting the branch line of the Fuxin Flour Mill, so that the branch line can be fully utilized to attract railway transportation. I am afraid that this is not because of the poor situation of the Makeng Road station, but to think about making up for it. However, giving up one's own efforts to cultivate others is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, the Makeng Road station is the hub of freight transportation on the railway. All goods from Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou are concentrated here. In the future, when the ferry opens, freight transportation will be even busier. The importance of the station's location is self-evident. If we do not broaden our horizons and strive for rectification today, I am afraid that it will become more corrupt and impossible to clean up in the future. The bureau should strive to improve the loading and unloading of goods at the station, the equipment of warehouses, and management, so as to increase credibility and facilitate merchants. Then, the future of business will have hope for development. This is the fundamental task of the railway at present, and it should not be allowed to be let go, so as not to be criticized by society. You must comply with the above and report on the handling situation. This order is issued on August 24, 22nd year of the Republic of China, by Minister Gu Mengyu."</p>
<p>Dengzhou Customs</p>
<h3>Changed to Tianqiaokou Branch Post</h3>
<p>Shipping Circles Should Pay Special Attention</p>
<p>Shandong Dengzhou Customs is now renamed Tianqiaokou. The North Sea ships of various shipping companies in Shanghai have encountered problems due to tax relations. They have specially submitted inquiries. The customs has clearly replied yesterday. This matter is very important to shipping and is hereby reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Tax Collection in Dengzhou</h3>
<p>The customs replied to the inquiry from various shipping bureaus about why the Dengzhou Customs tax collection was suddenly changed to Tianqiaokou. The reply stated briefly: "Dengzhou was originally the seat of the government, but after it was abolished, it was changed to Lai County. However, by custom, it is still mostly referred to as Dengzhou. The Tianqiaokou branch office under the customs is located near the county seat of the county. The shipping circles do not know the details, so the import and export goods to Yantai, Longkou, and other places are mostly paid in Dengzhou.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Regular Customs</h3>
<p>Before the abolition of the Likin tax, this place was originally listed as one of the five outer regular customs, so there was a regular customs office to collect goods tax, which was named Tianqiaokou Regular Customs. Since the abolition of Likin and the implementation of the tax increase, these five outer regular customs have been ordered to be abolished, and the customs has taken over the tax collection matters and set up a branch post, abolishing the names of Dengzhou and the five outer regular customs, and correcting to the current name.</p>
<h3>Shipping Must Know</h3>
<p>In the future, commercial ships traveling to the North Sea and the Shandong coast should still report and pay taxes at the Tianqiaokou Customs Branch Office for shipping certificates that do not specify the word Dengzhou. Even if Dengzhou is specified, the words Tianqiaokou Branch Customs must be added. This time, the North Sea ships of the Zhaoxing Company in this port have had problems with tax payment and reporting of import and export goods in Dengzhou and Tianqiaokou, so the customs has issued a clear notice.</p>
<p>Reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Only Three Overseas Chinese Remaining in Norway</h3>
<p>Norwegian Government Temporarily Approves Business</p>
<p>Until June of Next Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which read: "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: I have received your telegram. According to investigation, there were originally eight overseas Chinese in Norway. Among them, two obtained residence permits because they were not engaged in business. The remaining six jointly operated the Shanghai China Company in Oslo. Later, the Norwegian authorities used the expiration of their residence permits as an excuse to deport them. Our Minister to Sweden and Norway, Zhu Changnian, personally negotiated with the authorities in Oslo, but to no avail. Three Chinese businessmen then voluntarily left the country one after another. As of June of this year, there were only three overseas Chinese remaining in Norway, pending a ruling by the Ministry of Justice to determine whether or not to deport them. This Ministry will take the position that Norwegian merchants have never been discriminated against in China by the government and have twice informed the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires in China, requesting that he relay to the Norwegian government to pay attention to this point, reconsider, and still allow these overseas Chinese to continue to reside and do business, so as to reciprocate and strengthen friendship. Later, on the 16th of this month, the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires replied by telegram, stating that he had received a telegram from his government that the three Chinese merchants had been specially permitted to continue to reside and do business until June 1st of next year. All the negotiations regarding this case are telegraphed for your reference." (Official seal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), "Regarding the participation in Weihaiwei"</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Returning to Shanghai from National Exhibition</h3>
<p>The manufacturers from this city who participated in the first National Goods Exhibition in Weihaiwei have closed because the two-week period is over. More than 250 representatives of each factory took the Xinfeng ship yesterday morning and arrived in port at 6 p.m. yesterday. According to Mr. Xu Qiaoqi, the general manager of the Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods, "The association led the factories to participate in the Weihaiwei National Exhibition, and the results were excellent. There were 62 factories from Shanghai, 7 from Qingdao, 8 from Yantai, and 1 from Tianjin. The total turnover was 110,000 yuan, which proves the enthusiasm of the people of Weihaiwei for national goods. However, due to inconvenient transportation, the second batch of goods could not be shipped, otherwise the turnover would have been 200,000. The equipment was complete, and the hospitality was thoughtful, which gave us great satisfaction and gratitude. Before leaving, Xu Zushan, the commissioner of the Weihaiwei Management Office, said that he would allocate public land to build a special venue to prepare for the second large-scale National Exhibition in March next year. Commissioner Xu's enthusiasm and determination to promote national goods and his design for expanding the sales of factories in North China are truly rare officials today."</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Red Swastika Society's Relief Efforts in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society recently received a letter from the Wuhan Office, reporting on the work of rescuing disaster-stricken children in Shaanxi, and a report from the Fengxiang County Magistrate on the distribution of emergency relief. The original letters are recorded below: "Respected Sirs, Wuhan Letter: In view of the severe disaster in Shaanxi, we immediately organized a relief team, with Zhou Hanwen as the leader, and Wang Kangguo and Zhou Hangji as team members. On May 28, they led the laborers to Shaanxi, taking in 120 disaster-stricken children, and opened a temporary disaster-stricken children's relief center in Shaanxi to combine education and care, and classes have begun. Team leader Zhou Hanwen returned to Wuhan on the 18th of this month, etc."</p>
<p>"Respected Sirs, Fengxiang Letter: The 2,000 yuan relief donation from your association was handed over to Mr. Cui Xianlou to handle emergency relief. After careful investigation, the relief funds were distributed to the three villages of Duyang, Taichuan, and Xinglin. The Duyang area is larger and has historically received very little relief, so 800 yuan was allocated to it, and 600 yuan was allocated to each of Xinglin and Taichuan, for a total of 2,000 yuan. The handling situation is specially reported, etc."</p>
<h3>Lin Huanting's Coffin Sealed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Others Personally Came to Pay Their Condolences</p>
<p>His Daughter-in-Law, Hu Mulan, Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong to Attend the Funeral</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Huanting, an advanced member of the Kuomintang, passed away in Shanghai a few days ago. His coffin was sealed at his residence on Yuyuan Road at 4 p.m. yesterday. There were many condolence messages and wreaths from important people from all walks of life. At the time of the sealing of the coffin, in addition to President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Municipal Security Office Yang Hu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry Liu Weichi, Legislative Members Ma Chaojun, Chen Jianru, Fu Chengchang, former Minister of Finance Huang Hanliang, and Central Committee Member Zhang Dingfan, all personally came to pay their condolences. Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and his wife specially sent Secretary-General Chu Minyi as their representative to attend the memorial service. At the same time, Wang also sent a telegram to the Lin residence to comfort his family. It is reported that Mr. Lin's eldest daughter-in-law, Ms. Hu Mulan, heard the news and rushed from Hong Kong at about 5 p.m. yesterday. She was very sad that she could not see her father-in-law's death and coffin sealing in person.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Second Prison</p>
<h3>New Prison Building Completed</h3>
<p>Open for Use on September 1st</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties, Prisoners Unemployed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, due to the increasing number of prisoners, the existing prisons were insufficient. It was approved by the Judicial Administration Department to build ten new prison rooms. Since the start of construction, half a year has passed, and the entire project has been completed. It can be opened for use on September 1st. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>New House Completed</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing originally had a total of 20 houses, which could only accommodate more than 800 prisoners according to regulations. However, in recent years, the number of social crimes has increased, resulting in overcrowding, with as many as more than 1,800 people. The difference exceeds more than double, which is a great hindrance to health management. Therefore, a special request was made to the Judicial Administration Department to allocate funds to build new houses. Due to the limited funding and location, only ten new rooms were added, costing more than 40,000 yuan. Since the start of construction, it has now been completed. It is scheduled to be officially opened for use from September 1st. Each room can accommodate 50 prisoners. The new house faces south, and there is a courtyard in the center of each room, so the air is exceptionally sufficient and management is convenient.</p>
<h3>Prisoners Unemployed</h3>
<p>According to the prison warden, Tian Jinghua, there are more than 1,800 prisoners in the prison. Except for those who are sick, most of them are given work, on the one hand to concentrate their minds, and on the other hand to engage in production, which benefits both. However, due to financial reasons, the industry is contracted by outsiders, and the prison is not responsible for the benefits. Only a monthly labor fee is collected, about 1,000 yuan per month. However, in recent years, social industry has been declining, and the output of small industries has no sales. Therefore, several industries have recently been suspended. Currently, one-third of all prisoners have no industry to do. Although I want to provide relief, due to financial problems, there is really no way to think of it, etc.</p>
<p>After the warning from the Bureau of Public Works to each factory</p>
<h3>China Ping Pong Company Moves</h3>
<p>Deadline of Six Months, Fearing Forced Relocation</p>
<p>Drawings of New House Submitted to the Bureau of Public Works for Approval</p>
<p>The China Ping Pong Company at No. 19, Lane 809, Youheng Road, Hongkou, was warned by the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession and ordered to reform. 1) The boiler should be moved inward; 2) Build a three-hundred brick wall to ensure safety, and open a door to the outside to allow air to circulate; 3) Keep the fire escape door open; 4) Rewire the electrical wires; 5) No tents are allowed in the corridor; 6) Inventory must not be close to the factory, etc. These six items must be implemented within three weeks, otherwise they will be relocated to avoid public danger. The Joint Machine Association protested and supplemented the conditions of the Bureau of Public Works: 1) Add lead skin to the roof; 2) Prepare a fire escape sand to prevent accidents; 3) Broken celluloid and shavings should be placed in iron buckets, etc. Only then did the Bureau of Public Works agree to extend the deadline to six months. Two months have passed. The company is afraid that if it does not reform, it will be forced to close by the Bureau of Public Works, and the loss will be unimaginable. Hundreds of workers will lose their jobs. The company is also spending a lot of money to reform. For this reason, the company rented an open space at the end of Tangshan Road, Zhoujiatzui Road, from Oriental Linwen Real Estate Company. The drawings have been drawn and submitted to the Bureau of Public Works for review.</p>
<h3>Strange Death of a Tea Drinker</h3>
<h3>Sudden Death While Washing His Face</h3>
<p>At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, a man, about 30 years old, wearing a white short shirt, white undershirt, gray pants, white socks, and black cloth shoes, suddenly died in the Donglou Tea House next to the Great Hall in the City God Temple in the city. The waiter went to greet him as usual, and brewed a pot of scented tea and a basin of water for washing his face, and put them on the table for him to wash his face. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly fell to the ground for some reason while washing his face. The waiter saw this and rushed forward to check. The man had died. He reported the situation to Director Liu of the Second Branch of the First District. Because the man died strangely, and the matter was related to human life, he ordered the local head to report to the Shanghai District Court to request an autopsy. He also dispatched police officers to arrest the owner of Donglou Tea House for questioning.</p>

<h3>Shuang Brothers Return to China Together</h3>
<p>Mr. Shuang Ruwei, from Linchuan, Jiangxi, went to Germany to study two years ago. He first entered the Siemens Electrical Factory in Germany for a one-year internship, and then studied in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Berlin University of Technology. He has now completed his second year in the engineering department of the university, and his academic performance is very good. When Mr. Shuang was at school, in addition to studying hard, he was also very enthusiastic about student services. He served as an executive member of the German Students Association, and the association's facilities relied heavily on Mr. Shuang's planning efforts. Mr. Shuang is now returning to China for personal reasons and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. He will return to his hometown to visit his relatives within a few days. Once the matter is completed, he will return to Germany to continue his studies. It is expected that his future achievements will be extraordinary. In addition, Mr. Shuang's younger brother, Mr. Ruzhi, graduated from the Brandenburg Police Academy in Germany and interned at the Berlin Police Department for a long time. His knowledge and experience are very rich. He has now returned to China with his brother.</p>
<h3>Shareholders Meeting of the Flour Exchange</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Exchange held its 14th Second Shareholders Meeting at the market of the exchange at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday. There were 8,305 shares held by the shareholders. Chairman Wang Yiting asked for leave due to illness, and standing director Zhu Guangcheng represented the chairman. After the meeting began, the ceremony was performed, and the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, he reported on the business conditions for the first half of the year, saying that the average monthly turnover of the exchange market was about 13 to 14 million bags in the past. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the current situation, the financial stagnation in the city, the depression of various industries, and the nervousness of the northern merchants, they did not dare to do large-scale flour business in Shanghai, resulting in a reduction in the average daily turnover of the market from January to April of this year to about 100,000 bags. This was not enough to cover the daily expenses of the exchange. After Guangcheng and others repeatedly considered, they had to strive for frugality in all miscellaneous expenses in order to balance income and expenditure. After the establishment of the North China ceasefire agreement, the hearts of the northerners were slightly at ease, and merchants from all walks of life rushed to do business. Therefore, the business of the exchange in May and June began to turn around, etc. Then, the supervisor Zhu Yunzhang reported briefly on the income and expenditure accounts for the first half of the year. The shareholders then moved various items one after another. After they were passed, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Fire Truck Drove Too Fast</p>
<h3>Smashed Through the Walls of Tongren Hospital</h3>
<p>At about 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the Hongkou Shenjiawan Fire Brigade suddenly received a report stating that a fire had occurred at the intersection of Broadway and Huaji Road. After receiving the report, the brigade immediately sent three vehicles to fight the fire. However, the third fire truck, No. 22, drove onto the steps near Tongren Hospital at the intersection of Peng Road and Seward Road due to the driver's carelessness, and the wheels turned too fast, causing the car to crash into the walls of Tongren Hospital, creating a hole. At the same time, the fire truck overturned completely. Only the driver and fireman Jiang Zhaokang were scratched on the chest, feet, and head. They were immediately taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. As the injuries were very minor, they were discharged after being bandaged. At the same time, efforts were made to turn the car over and drag it back to the brigade. However, the internal machinery has been damaged, and it will cost a lot of money to repair and use it immediately.</p>
<p>Gun Bullet Mistakenly Hits Thief's Shoulder</p>
<h3>Wei Jinbiao's Injuries Still Minor</h3>
<p>Sun Shucheng, Yang Zhongjing, and other detectives from the Sixth District of West Shanghai, based on a tip from an informant on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, arrested Chen Dazhi, an accumulated thief, on Robert Sheng Road and brought him back to the district. According to Chen's confession, the 24-year-old admitted that he had stolen clothes from a certain family on Singapore Road several times, and also confessed that his accomplice, Wei Jinbiao, was hiding near the Yanping Road intersection.</p>
<p>Sun and Yang, two detectives, then took Chen to the address at 12:00 p.m. that night. Wei was sleeping at the time, and the doors were tightly shut. Chen shouted outside, and Wei opened the upstairs window and looked down, seeing Chen and the detectives standing at the door. Wei said to Chen, "You go quickly, otherwise I'll beat you to death." Afterwards, they heard the sound of a gun being loaded in the building. Chen then said to the two detectives, "You have to be careful." After a while, Wei pushed open the door and ran out with a weapon. Detective Yang immediately ordered him to stop. Before the words were finished, Yang's pistol suddenly went off, and with a bang, it hit Wei's shoulder. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor. At the same time, a stolen bicycle was seized in his house and brought back to the Sixth District. After District Officer Jiang interrogated Chen, he sent a document to the General Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>During a Torrential Rain</p>
<h3>Electric Car Leaked Electricity, Passengers Panicked</h3>
<p>The Accumulator Box Under the Car Was Completely Burned</p>
<p>A Seven-Year-Old Child Was Kicked and Injured in the Confusion</p>
<p>At about 7:20 p.m. last night, when it was raining heavily, an electric trolleybus No. 367 of a certain route in the Public Concession, suddenly leaked electricity from the electric box under the car when it was driving through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Cardinal Mercier, alarming the passengers in the car and causing great chaos. The driver of the car forgot to pull the overhead cable down to disconnect it from the power line and prevent the fire from spreading. As a result, white smoke filled the air and a fire was about to break out. Seeing this, the passengers panicked even more and rushed out of the car. As a result, a seven-year-old child surnamed Mou was trampled and injured in the foot. Fortunately, the Xinzha Fire Brigade had received the alarm and sent a fire truck to the scene immediately, and quickly pulled down the overhead power cable on the roof of the car, so the disaster was averted. However, the storage box and other items under the car had been destroyed, so the company was notified to send a car to tow it back to the factory for repairs. The young child who was trampled was only slightly injured, so his family treated him on their own.</p>

The South Goods Workers Held a Representative Congress Yesterday The workers in the South Goods industry in this city signed 23 labor-management conditions in 1930.

Letter from Western Islam Dr. Halide Shechuek, President of the British Islamic General Assembly, gave a lecture on "Islam in the West" at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge on August 18. Dr. Cao Xuexiang translated his words as follows: Bingxun Shorthand Society, Niu Jing, Cai Zhaodu Jointly Record Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to be invited by the YMCA and various Islamic groups to give a lecture today. May everyone be at peace, because saying "May peace be upon you" is Islamic etiquette. Today's topic is "Islam in the West." There is also a lot of Islam in the East. Apart from Turkey and Russia in the West, there are about 7 million Islamic believers in countries such as England, Germany, and France. In addition to Muslims, there are probably many followers of other religions in the audience at today's lecture. Some people think that Islam is against Christianity, but it is not. Islam has no meaning against other religions at all. The Koran often says that Christianity and Judaism have a linked relationship with Islam. Islam does not oppose other prophets either. For example, Christians believe in Jesus, and Islam also respects Jesus and does not oppose him. Islam went to Europe in the West for a long time. When it arrived in Spain, Islam studied literature, science, and everything else in Spain. At the same time, it brought an Arab woman to the West. Therefore, there are many Arabic word origins in the study of Western languages today. The purpose of Islam is to protect all kinds of people, not for Islam itself. Islam is a great harmony of thought, with no thought of religious distinction at all. Islam does not distinguish between races. In an Islamic church, whether Asian, African, white, or yellow, everyone is brothers. Islam is very equal and has a strong nationalistic thought, so there is a trend in European countries to believe in Islam. Some people have said that European countries, especially England, will definitely believe in Islam in the future. This gentleman studies various religions and pays special attention to Islam, so he casually said a few words. Looking at the trend of Islam, and the trend of the world, there is also a person who studies socialism. He has studied communism, capitalism, nationalism, etc. As a result, he feels that the progress of socialism is very great. Islam pays attention to social thought, so he said these few words. Also, Mr. Montaigne of France said that France also has a trend to believe in Islam in a hundred years. Why is there a trend for everyone to believe in Islam in Western countries? Because Islam believes in one God, and all people are equal. Whether farmers, workers, knowledgeable, or uneducated, there is no distinction of class in an Islamic church. Everyone is equal. Now Western Muslims are holding a conference. There are 7 million people in European countries who believe in Islam. This conference represents 7 million Islamic believers, or even more than that, because Islam does not include Russia and Turkey, but representatives from Russia and Turkey are attending the conference, so there are many people this time. I am not a politician and have no political activities, but I have recently heard and seen that Shanghai newspapers have published that an anti-imperialist and anti-war conference will be held in Shanghai soon. Now European Islam is also holding a conference there. This conference is also an anti-war conference. The purpose of this conference is to promote world peace and for everyone to eliminate private opinions. Therefore, the mission of Islamic disciples is peace, with no private opinions and no barriers. Now I will briefly report on the number of Muslims in various countries. When Islam started in the United States, I was the chairman there. There is an Islamic General Assembly throughout the United States, and there are branches everywhere. There are now 250,000 believers in the United States. There is a small church in New York that spent more than 4,000 US dollars to build a church. Now there are Islamic groups from New York to Harlem Farir and the western United States. There are already 4,000 Muslims in Mexico. There are also several other cities. There is Cuba to the west, which is where sugar comes from. There are also 3,000 Muslims there. There are also 18,000 Muslims in British, French, and Dutch South America. Now it is increasing very quickly. There are also many Muslims in other places, such as Brazil and Argentina. Now, across the Atlantic to Europe, heading east is Turkey. Turkey believes in Islam. Some people say that the chairman of Turkey now seems to be against Islam, using the name of the Islamic Bible to do whatever he wants. These words are not true. The chairman of Turkey now, we call him president. Someone asked him if he was doing things according to the Islamic Bible. He said that he only knew how to protect Islam, and he was willing to shed blood. It can be seen that saying that he is against Islam is a rumor. There is a large printing house in Albania, all of whom are Slavs. They also print a lot of books about Islam. Further east is Hungary and part of Austria, with 500,000 Muslims and 2 million Catholics. Their chairman protects them very much. Muslims and Christians can cooperate very well. Christians and Muslims participate in the Holy Scriptures together. The Catholics in Greece also want to study Islam. I received a letter from them asking me to give a lecture there. There is also a large Islamic church there. I gave a lecture in English, and it can be translated afterwards. As for Austria, they also have a society for studying Islam, and they invited me to be the honorary chairman. There is a large Islamic church in Paris, France, and there is no hospital or place to eat in the church, just like the YMCA. There are a total of 50,000 Muslims. There is also an Islamic church in Berlin, Germany. There are people who study Islam and believe in Islam there. There are also 5,000 Muslims in Belgium. Now, due to time constraints, I cannot go into detail about other countries. I will talk about the situation in England. When Islam was introduced to England, England was very chaotic, just like the Warring States period in China. At that time, the emperor's portrait was engraved on one side of the British currency, and the words "I believe in Islam and regard Muhammad as the leader of the religion" were engraved on the other side. In 1675, many people went to Mecca to worship Islam, just like Chinese people making pilgrimages to mountains. Recently, a British princess declared to me that she also believed in Islam. One of her cousins is also in the audience today, so all classes in England believe in Islam. There are now 30,000 Islamic believers in the UK. In 1886, there was a lawyer who first promoted Islam in Liverpool. The city of Liverpool is the greatest city in the sky. In 1905, just over 20 years ago, he promoted Islam in London. A senior military officer also believes in Islam. There are two Islamic churches in England, one in London and the other 20 miles away from London. Although there are only two Islamic churches, there are 300 places to pray. At the mouth of the Thames River, I bought a piece of land. When I had not left England, I had already read the engineer building an Islamic church there. In large cities and commercial ports in England, many people who go to the East live there for a long time and marry the British. Among them, many also believe in Islam. However, Islam also has a shortcoming, that is, there are too few books explaining Islam, because they only care about praying and do not study and explain books about Islam. Therefore, more English should be used to translate books about Islam, and then English should be used to explain Islam, so that more people will understand Islam, because the English language and writing are the most popular in the world. The books written in Islamic script are mostly written by people who oppose Islam and cannot clearly explain the truth of Islam, so they cannot be read. For example, if I want to know about China, I cannot read books that oppose China. I must read books written by Chinese intellectuals to understand the truth. If people who are not Muslims want to know about Islam, they can contact Muslims and not read books that oppose Islam. People in Shanghai can talk to British and American Muslims to learn the truth about Islam. Now Islam in the West is progressing very quickly and making great progress. Recently, there have been many publications that seem to respect Islam, but they are actually saying nonsense, with the aim of opposing Islam, which has aroused public outrage among Muslims. Muslims do not want to attack others, but if others deliberately attack Islam, then Muslims must defend themselves. I say this not to demonstrate, nor to advocate struggle, but to ask everyone to understand that Islam has no will to force people, because religion is free. Today, due to the urgency of time, I can only briefly report on the situation of Islam in the West and the number of Muslims in various countries. I came to China this time to learn, not to teach, because China is a country with an ancient culture, but what I hope is that Chinese Muslims can cooperate, and extend this to Western Muslims, so that everyone can communicate with each other, because the spirit of Islam is peace, and all Muslims are brothers. Today, the weather is very hot. I am very grateful that you have come to listen to the lecture. On the Harmony of Spring and Autumn Thin Gull In the city, only nine out of ten families have two strips of red paper couplets pasted on their doors, and on the second or third door, the words of this couplet are even more uniform: "Harmony brings auspiciousness, thick virtue brings fortune." These two sentences are purely the tone of elders teaching younger generations, just like the current "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard." Because my younger brothers often have to enter and exit between these eight characters all year round, they unintentionally get a very deep impression, but although everyone has impressions, the results of the impressions are different for each person. Some people have cultivated themselves to be very harmonious, while others still inevitably retain the violent aura created by other bad impressions, and never change. We Chinese often regard the two words "harmony" as meaning being inferior and submissive, which is actually wrong! The reason why our country submits to the Japanese government in every way is another matter, and it is definitely not harmony. The meaning of harmony is that before others have taken any obvious insulting or offensive actions against you, you should always treat them with a gentle attitude, that is, always smile at people and try to avoid being arrogant. Judging from the actions of Chinese people who are brave but submissive to foreigners, it seems that harmonious people must be in the absolute majority. In fact, it is the opposite. Especially those public officials, as well as the staff of customs, post office, banks, railways, etc., never pay attention to how the two words "harmony" should be interpreted. Although these people are often very harmonious to foreigners, so as not to cause international disputes, they are always arrogant to their own compatriots, which cannot but make foreigners laugh! Furthermore, in ordinary society, there are countless disputes caused by one party not being harmonious first, which is especially inexhaustible, even leading to lawsuits and jail. The reason for this is nothing more than a slight lack of harmony. When things come to a head, I think everyone will deeply regret it. Even if such a dispute does not occur, it is enough for a person to suffer from being unharmonious. Because humans are things that cannot survive without being in groups, if you are always unharmonious everywhere and always quarrel and fight with others, the result will inevitably lead to an isolated position, losing all assistance. At that time, you will inevitably become unharmonious yourself, and then your conscience will be condemned and your reason will be blamed. Many people die from this! Therefore, harmony is not only a key to getting along in the world, but also a basic skill for being a person! The Skills of Hands, Mouth, and Eyes Wing People in the mainland all think that Shanghai is a place where gold is everywhere. When they encounter difficulties, as long as they run to Shanghai, they will immediately have a way out. This "belief" is not entirely wrong. At least it is not completely wrong. It is indeed easier to find food in Shanghai than in the mainland. However, why are there so many unemployed people in Shanghai? I guess the reason is that they overemphasize the knowledge in their minds and neglect the skills of their hands, mouth, and eyes, so they are rejected everywhere and no one hires them. In fact, it is not difficult to find a job in Shanghai, but it is indeed very difficult to rely on the knowledge in your mind. No matter how talented you are, you are not worth a penny. As the ancients said, "A belly full of articles cannot fill hunger." If you have a little skill in your hands, mouth, and eyes, you can sell it everywhere. Street fortune tellers are the best example. They only need to hang a picture on the wall by the roadside, and many people will stop to watch it. And among the many people watching, there will always be a few who want to have their faces read. The fortune teller lightly teases someone with a few words, and this person will half-push half-pull, and helplessly let him read their face. Then, the fortune teller's one hand holds the hand of the person having their face read, the other finger points east and west, the mouth speaks eloquently, and at the same time, the skill of the eyes is even more important. The two eyeballs turn with the words in the mouth, and the words follow how the eyeballs turn, with high and low pauses, corresponding to each other, and cannot be messed up at all. Recently, there have suddenly been more street fortune tellers in Shanghai, probably because they understand that "a belly full of articles cannot fill hunger," and have changed to practicing the skills of their hands, mouth, and eyes, and are flocking to this path. However, skills also have distinctions between being skilled and unskilled. If the eyes and mouth can correspond to each other without getting confused, the business must be good. If the business is slow, it must be because the mouth and eyes do not correspond to each other. Shanghai is an incredible metropolis, with no shortage of fortune-telling customers in suits and leather shoes. Unemployed people, this path has great potential, quickly put away the knowledge in your minds and practice the skills of your hands, mouth, and eyes. Moreover, with this skill, you can not only be a fortune teller, but also do other things with ease. Understand it spiritually, it depends on the person. The Realm of the Goddesses Hu Chenzhou I was sitting on the right-hand side of the No. 11 bus going to Jinshenfu Road. The outside of the car was noisy, and the inside of the car was so quiet, so quiet. I was looking out the window, which had been lowered more than halfway, with my two eyes, unconsciously. At first, I only saw a lot of bare arms, a lot of bare legs, a lot of waving fans... But at this moment, I saw, on the sidewalk, in the road... a large group of people! Men, women, old, young, standing in a circle... and standing in groups of three or four. My eyes flashed like lightning, scanning the group of people like this. Ah, in their center: a lot of white faces, a lot of yellow eyes, a lot of red mouths... a lot of smiles! A lot of desolate bitter smiles! I caught a glimpse of a girl about fifteen or sixteen years old, dressed like an ordinary female student, dragging a big fat man. How silly the big fat man looked! But she was bitterly smiling, bitterly smiling, dragging him hard, dragging him. My ears faintly heard a sentence: "Come sit with me for a while!" The voice was strangely sharp, like the cry of a sharp ghost. Then, there was another burst of desolate bitter laughter. "They're out soliciting customers so early?" "Summer is especially early." "Won't the police interfere?" "Interfere with what? They pay 'prostitution tax'!" "Oh, pay 'prostitution tax'!" This was the conversation between the two people sitting in front of me, breaking the silent air in the car. "Alas, there are really a lot of wild chickens!" "That's a symbol of the bankruptcy of the rural economy!" "Alas, this is not the era it used to be. It's simply a 'world of promiscuity'!" ...That's a symbol of the bankruptcy of the rural economy! I turned my head. I saw the young man who said this to the old man he was talking to. Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Our bus flew forward, and in just a moment, flew past the realm of the goddesses. Now I see: The long and short hands of the big clock are pointing to the number nine. The three big characters "Hong Xi Bao" on the clock jumped: "Hong," "Xi," "Bao": "Hong Xi Bao." "Hong"... jumping, jumping. Fifty Years Later Dragon In the year 72 of the Republic of China, compatriots held a grand celebration because the Central Army had recovered the four northeastern provinces and reclaimed Dalian, Taiwan, and other places. Several major powers, seeing China's strength, automatically returned Hong Kong, Annam, Outer Mongolia, and other places. Resistance generals established bronze statues everywhere for people to admire, and the worship of Guan Yu and Yue Fei was greatly affected. In a certain month, China was elected as the chairman of the League of Nations and promoted to a strong country. Because there were no passengers to carry and no goods to load, all foreign ships sold all their merchant ships to the China Merchants Bureau at low prices, and the China Merchants Bureau became the leader in the world's shipping industry. At this time, China's warships, connected together, could circle the entire coast of the country and have enough to spare. There were so many airplanes in the air that everyone could ride them. Chinese university students need to look up the dictionary to know the meaning of words such as "concession" and "consul." The country is becoming stronger day by day, and foreign insults are multiplying. Saving the country in the east and resisting donations in the west are all futile and stupid. In fact, as long as we pay attention to hygiene and extend our lives by 50 years, we can see the prosperous scene, dancing and singing! The Northeast Four Company Commanders Zhang Henshui Chapter 14 It is difficult to find a wife, lingering and worrying about the future Inviting friends for a small gathering, recalling the past One day I met Company Commander He of the Second Battalion, supervising two soldiers, carrying two large rattan baskets of broken shoes and socks, pouring them into the earthen pit. The baskets passed in front of me, and the stench made me want to vomit. I smiled at Company Commander He and said, "The shoes and socks are so stinky, even if they are carried away, I'm afraid there will still be a stench in the house." He said bluntly, "Isn't that right? But he has his own way. He bought a dollar's worth of eau de cologne and sprayed it all over the house. Then there's no stench, you can't smell it." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Old Guan, when I passed by Dongcheng, I met foreign soldiers, and I always thought, their clothes are all wool and leather, and they fit their bodies, and they're not too big or too small at all. They also take eight yuan..." Guan Yaowu said, "Others, they raise a soldier that's at least as good as raising ten or eight of ours. We're not people, just animals, how can we compare with them?" Zhao Ziqiang laughed, "Don't say any more, idle talk will only arouse your complaints again." Guan Yaowu said, "The inspection committee is probably coming soon, we have to start preparing." As he spoke, he picked up his hat, and a letter fell on the floor. Zhao Ziqiang bent down and picked up the letter, handing it to Guan Yaowu and saying, "It says 'Confidential, Guan,' is it a letter from your wife?" Guan Yaowu didn't take the letter, sighed, and didn't say anything. Then he raised his hands, looking lazy, and sat down. Zhao Ziqiang read the words on the envelope again, and there were no mistakes. Then he looked at him and said, "What do you mean?" Guan Yaowu shook his head and said, "Look at that letter, if you bring it up, my head really hurts." Zhao Ziqiang was a little puzzled, so he tore open the letter to read. It said: Yaowu, my husband: It's been half a month since we parted, I hope you are in good health. I miss you very much. The money at home has long been used up. I originally wanted to use Wang Si Ge's hui loan, but the interest rate was too low on the day of the bidding, so someone else bid it away. In addition, the second child suddenly had a fever a few days ago, and it didn't go away for a long time. Only yesterday did I pawn my wife's jewelry to pay for medical expenses. I hope you will come home immediately after receiving the letter, so that I will not be anxious. I wish you well. Your wife, Yuan Shi (171) Women's Paradise Simple Manicure Technique Bo Guang Western women pay great attention to manicure. Chinese women did not know how to manicure before the Republic of China, and kept their nails very long, collecting dirt and making it inconvenient to work. Modern women manicure their nails very clean. It is best to use nail clippers to trim the nails, as they are neater than scissors. After trimming, there is no need to use a small file to polish them, because nail files will turn the nails gray after prolonged use. Just use fine sandpaper to gently rub them. After rubbing, wash with warm water and high-quality scented soap, and apply a little glycerin (available at Western pharmacies) to the nails. They will be shiny and clean. Glycerin can protect the nail film. Nail polish is not necessary, but if you want to apply it, "crimson" is better! Chinese nail polish is too thick, and it is not applied evenly. Some have a very strong smell. I hope it can be improved! The Latest Facial Makeup Method Ren Ping Not long ago, I saw this on the Internet. Based on my memory, I am writing it down as follows: First, wash the face with water. Before it is completely dry, apply face powder. Then, gently wipe it off with a soft silk handkerchief. (At this time, it is best to look in the mirror and make sure there are no traces of powder left.) After wiping it clean, apply a skin cream or moisturizing cream to the palms of your hands and rub it on both cheeks. (Make sure it is evenly applied.) After rubbing it evenly, wait for it to dry slightly, and then apply a little more face powder. After wiping it off, take rouge cream and apply a "center point" on the cheeks. Then, move it upward with your hands (avoid applying too much rouge. If you have applied too much, you can add a little face powder. It is best to start with a darker color and then fade it). After this, those who draw eyebrows can draw their eyebrows. When drawing eyebrows, start from the inner end of the eyebrow and go outward. After the eyebrow drawing process is completed, apply lipstick deeply in the middle of the upper and lower lips. Then, close your lips tightly and gently rub them left and right. Where the color is uneven, you can gently lick it with the tip of your tongue. It is best to apply a little oil before applying lipstick. This will make it easier to apply evenly. Smiley Tips: To keep the lipstick red longer, you can apply a little oil after applying lipstick. Not only will it be glossy, but even those with a "sweet tooth" can kiss a few more times without easily washing it off! Beauty Tips Pei Yu Inappropriate and unsuitable diets are most likely to damage the beauty of the face. The degree of damage is more harmful than anything else. Therefore, to have a beautiful face, the diet should have appropriate timing, frequency, amount, and suitable ingredients. If you want to maintain "maiden beauty" forever, you must avoid salt, dried meat, spices, pickled foods, excessive sauces, etc. Foods that are made by chopping and mixing meat and vegetables, and that have been cooked twice, are also not suitable. Good teeth are an essential element of beauty. There is nothing better than an apple for cleaning teeth. Washing your face with cold water is very good. It can stimulate the skin and speed up blood flow. This can bring the fresh red color of roses to the face, surging out from the cheeks. To truly achieve the purpose of beauty, adequate exercise is essential. This is very important and should be remembered and put into practice. After taking a hot bath, use a sponge soaked in cold water to rub your whole body. Walking is a good exercise that everyone can do. Women often hesitate, thinking they do not have free time to take longer walks. In fact, it is easy</h3>

<p>Every Monday is Publication Day. Issue 37. On Regulating Food and Enduring Troubles</p>
<p>Last week (August 21st), Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, at the National Government Memorial Week meeting, noting the low price of wheat and its sluggish sales, proposed regulating food to reverse the downward trend in prices. The following day, at the 121st meeting of the Executive Yuan, it was also decided to investigate the domestic wheat sales situation within a week to find remedies. It is commendable that the government authorities are paying such close attention to the people's livelihood and seeking benefits for farmers. However, under the current situation in our country, any kind of economic regulation can easily lead to more troubles, and even be manipulated. Of course, in the pursuit of construction, we shouldn't simply give up and allow destruction just because there are obstacles and manipulations. Nor should we resign ourselves to inaction and avoid reform due to the current environment. For example, if we want to adjust the prices of agricultural products and solve livelihood problems, we must impose a certain degree of regulation. Therefore, even knowing that implementation is difficult, we should seek solutions within those difficulties.</p>
<p>How to regulate is a complex question. It cannot be done without proper preparation. Even with adequate preparation, it won't work without a deep understanding of the facts. Even with understanding, if the implementation is misguided, it will still be ineffective. Moreover, we are now in a global economic era, where one action affects everything. We cannot isolate ourselves. Therefore, regulating domestic food must also take into account the production, sales, and changes of food abroad!</p>
<p>Taking the current decline and sluggish sales of wheat as an example, there is no doubt that some unscrupulous merchants are manipulating the market. But how can these merchants manipulate it? We must know that price fluctuations generally stem from the laws of supply and demand and the abundance or scarcity of currency. Can merchants really manipulate these factors? Of course not. What merchants can do is simply seize opportunities, exploit trends, and manipulate what they can. If there are no opportunities for manipulation, they cannot do so. And merchants in China, it can be said, do not have much real power to manipulate. Even large merchants trying to manipulate the Shanghai Stock Exchange often fail if they "go against the tide." Therefore, we must understand that the ability of unscrupulous merchants to manipulate or hoard is not due to their own inherent power. By understanding the reasons why they can manipulate and hoard, it is not difficult to eliminate the possibility of them doing so. Secondly, we need to understand the reasons for the current sluggish sales. Even after the price has dropped, why can't it be sold? Is it that farmers are unwilling to sell at low prices, or merchants are unwilling to buy at high prices? If so, under the condition of genuine goods at a fair price, is the current market price actually high or low? If the current price of wheat, even though it is below the cost of production, is still considered reasonable compared to other wheat, then what methods should be used to raise the price? Furthermore, why are merchants unwilling to buy even at low prices? Is it because they expect the market price to continue to fall due to a bumper harvest, or because the quality of the wheat is so poor that it is unsalable, or is there another reason that could cause the price of wheat to fall further? If any of these are the case, how should we eliminate these factors and allow merchants to proceed with their wheat purchases without hesitation?</p>
<p>Speaking of the recent drop in wheat prices, the main reasons are: (1) This year's harvest is better than in previous years. According to Shanghai grain merchants, this year's wheat production is half again as much as in previous years, roughly enough to supply flour mills for eight months. This rough calculation may not be accurate, but a bumper harvest is a fact. Even according to this calculation, flour mills still lack four months' worth of wheat and must rely on imported wheat. Since the result is still that supply does not meet demand, why does the price of wheat keep falling? This is due to the psychology of merchants. Merchants aim to profit, and they naturally choose to operate where there are potential gains and no potential losses. Hearing of a bumper wheat harvest, they fear further price drops and potential losses, so they become cautious and reluctant to buy more. Generally speaking, merchants tend to sell when prices fall and buy when prices rise – this is a common phenomenon. (2) The cotton and wheat loan has also had an impact. Admittedly, the cotton and wheat involved in this loan are simply changing from cash transactions to credit purchases. Judging from the annual import volume of cotton and wheat, this should not cause domestic cotton and wheat production to stagnate. However, one point has been overlooked: the relationship of "timing." Firstly, it coincided with a relatively abundant harvest year. Secondly, not sooner or later, the loan happened to be established when the new wheat was just entering the market. The price of wheat was already likely to fluctuate. This loan only added insult to injury, weakening the market sentiment. The price then plunged, falling by as much as one yuan. Given this sharp price drop, merchants are also concerned about how the market price will change after more than 12 million bushels of imported wheat arrive, so they are adopting a "wait and see" approach with domestic wheat. (3) The impact of the global wheat harvest and dumping. Since last year's global wheat harvest, various countries have taken measures to protect their domestic agricultural products. On the one hand, they have built high barriers to prevent the entry of foreign wheat. On the other hand, countries with surpluses are still trying their best to dump their excess wheat abroad. The most convenient country for dumping is China, with its open doors and free trade. No matter which country, whether agricultural or industrial products, can flood into China. Fortunately, Chinese merchants only care about immediate profits and ignore future harms. Having suffered from the economic aggression of imperialism, their national economic consciousness has long disappeared. As a result, they welcome all comers and the more the better, accommodating the world's most difficult situations. However, the situation may change in the future. Firstly, since inflation in the United States, the price of wheat in Chicago has risen by 112% from early March to early July. Secondly, the United States has experienced a drought this year, resulting in a poor wheat harvest. This is already a fact. Thirdly, the London Wheat Conference has been successfully concluded. According to a Reuters report from London on August 25th, an agreement has been reached with the following conditions: (1) Exporting countries agree to limit their total exports in 1933-34 to 560 million bushels; (2) Except for the Soviet Union and the Danube countries, exporting countries will reduce their production by 15% in 1934-35; (3) Importing countries agree to revise tariffs when the wheat price reaches 12 Swiss gold francs per 100 kilograms, or 63.6 gold cents per bushel (referring to delivery at the destination port), and also agree not to use the opportunity of automatic reduction in export quotas by exporting countries to develop domestic industries. Thirty-one countries participated. After this agreement is established, the price of wheat will be relatively stable, and domestic wheat will also benefit from it. (4) The impact of the dumping of foreign flour. Flour mills in the Shanghai area mostly use wheat from Jiangbei, and the flour is mainly sold in Tianjin. Unexpectedly, foreigners see that with the dumping of foreign wheat, Chinese people still have labor to benefit from, so they simply dump foreign flour. This only benefits a few Chinese intermediary merchants, and no one else. As a result, the Tianjin market is flooded with Japanese flour, Soviet flour, Australian flour, etc., while Chinese flour is retreating. With a narrower market for Shanghai flour mills, the demand for wheat has naturally decreased. (5) There is also a special reason. Every year when new wheat comes onto the market, flour mills buy and store some old wheat to blend with the new wheat for flour production. It is said that this year, they have prepared enough for two months' consumption, making their appetite for new wheat even more sluggish. (6) Due to the dumping of foreign flour, flour prices have gradually declined, falling to around 2.10 yuan per bag (49 pounds). If 71-72 catties of flour are produced from wheat costing 3.56 yuan, manufacturers still consider it unprofitable. If wheat prices rise but flour prices cannot rise, it is feared that more machines will be shut down and imports of foreign flour will become even more rampant.</p>
<p>The above are just the main reasons for the drop in wheat prices. Of course, there are many other causes of market price fluctuations, which cannot all be listed. By understanding the main reasons and seeking their consequences, and then tracing back from the consequences to find solutions, we can determine how to regulate wheat and protect the economic interests of farmers.</p>
<p>Naturally, the most important thing is to regulate wheat prices. However, it is easier for the government to suppress high prices using administrative orders and authority. To raise low prices, real power is needed. The best approach is for the government to adopt the ancient "ever-normal granary" system, buying when prices are low and selling when prices are high, thereby regulating the market to prevent low prices from harming farmers and high prices from harming the people. Or, the Farmers Bank, agricultural warehouses, or pawnshops in rural areas, can be supported by government funds and guarantees to accept mortgages on wheat and other commodities, helping farmers alleviate their immediate needs and wait for a better time to sell. Whether these measures are feasible depends on the government's determination. Other measures, such as raising tariffs and banning imports, may have little effect or may not be feasible under the current conditions in China. In addition, restricting flour mills from using less foreign wheat and more domestic wheat may also be possible. Generally speaking, the proportion of foreign to domestic wheat used by flour mills is 40% foreign and 60% domestic. If, after a thorough investigation, domestic wheat can indeed supply enough, then it may be possible to restrict flour mills to using 30% foreign and 70% domestic wheat, or even 20% foreign and 80% domestic wheat.</p>
<p>However, it must be understood that even though the domestic wheat harvest is abundant, it is not excessive; there is still a risk of shortage. Furthermore, merchants do need wheat, but they are deeply concerned due to temporary influences. In addition, flour sales are sluggish and wheat stocks are still plentiful, so there is currently no large-scale demand. The worry is that overeating will lead to fear, and the underlying issues have not been resolved. If we can reduce the fear and eliminate external influences, domestic wheat can be revived.</p>
<p>Digestion is not a problem; as metabolism continues, stagnation will naturally disappear. This is just a matter of time. Reducing fear is also not difficult. The recent sharp drop in wheat prices and the merchants' wait-and-see attitude are mainly due to the influence of the cotton and wheat loan. The government should clearly state to merchants that before domestic wheat has been adequately sold, the foreign wheat purchased by the government will not be put on the market. At the same time, it should openly discuss sales methods with grain merchants to dispose of the wheat in a way that does not harm the people's food supply, does not harm farmers, and does not harm industry and commerce. If the government can do this, merchants will understand the government's attitude and have no reason to be surprised or suspicious. They will naturally dare to buy freely. Fortunately, the Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office has been established, and Minister Song will return to China soon, so a solution should be found soon.</p>
<p>With digestion complete and fear reduced, the most difficult task remains to eliminate underlying issues and prevent external influences, as there are always potential threats to the root cause. The so-called underlying issues and external influences are the unrestricted import of foreign flour and wheat. If imports are banned, it is absolutely impossible to do so at present. If they are allowed to continue unchecked, they will seep in everywhere like mercury, not only leaving domestic wheat with no market but also forcing flour mills to close. Since we cannot ban imports completely—in fact, we cannot completely ban them because there is still a need for supplementary supplies—then we can only limit them. In our country today, any matter involving foreign relations is fraught with difficulties and obstacles. The most feasible approach would be to implement a registration and licensing system for the import and sale of flour and wheat—not just flour and wheat, but all commodities. Merchants, whether ordering goods from abroad or selling goods that have already arrived, must register with a certain agency and obtain a license before they are allowed to purchase. If they cannot produce a license, customs will not allow the goods to land, and the goods will not be allowed to circulate inland. If it is determined that the quantity purchased by the merchant exceeds the national need or that there is no need for foreign grain, the purchase license may be suspended. In this way, we can achieve a regulatory effect, eliminate the risk of food stagnation, protect farmers and workers, and safeguard commerce. In the absence of other solutions, this may be a viable approach. As for how to organize, operate, and prepare this agency, it is beyond the scope of this article and will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>However, there is a more serious issue than wheat, and that is rice. Since the flooding of foreign rice in the previous year, the bumper autumn harvest last year, and the continuing low rice prices this year, farmers are struggling to make ends meet. The sight of them in a precarious state is all too common in rural areas. In a blink of an eye, it will be time for the new rice harvest. If no measures are taken promptly, even if the government provides relief after November or December, farmers will hardly benefit, and the profits will go to merchants and landlords. Therefore, if new rice remains cheap this year, farmers will inevitably be impoverished next year, and there will be no hope of rural revitalization. This is something we deeply hope the authorities will pay attention to as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Can Usury Be Abolished? by Shi Hao</h3>
<p>The flow of capital has lost its normal course. There is an excess of idle capital in the major commercial ports, while credit is depleted in the interior, especially in rural areas. Farmers cannot obtain small loans, and when they do, the interest rates are so high that they cannot bear the burden. Commentators are dissatisfied with usury, believing that rural poverty stems from a lack of capital, and this lack is caused by high interest rates. They believe that only by abolishing usury can rural revitalization be achieved. This view has been widely echoed and become the prevailing opinion. However, based on economic theory and factual examination, this may not be the case. Let me explain this simply:</p>
<p>Interest rates do not arise by chance; they have economic reasons as their foundation. The outflow of capital from the interior and the resulting rise in interest rates are not what lenders intend; economic principles govern this process. Ever since Ricardo's theory of rent, those who discuss interest rates have always said that interest is the price of borrowing capital. Those who have capital do not invest it in profitable ventures but lend it to others, because lending is also a way to make a profit. Interest is the income from this profit-making activity. Borrowers are willing to repay the principal plus interest because they can use the borrowed capital to generate profit. Interest is a portion of that profit. The cost of borrowing is determined by the profit rate of capital between lenders and borrowers. If the supply and demand between borrowers and lenders do not match, interest rates will be low when supply exceeds demand, and high when demand exceeds supply. Lenders always seek high interest rates, so if there is another financial market with higher interest rates, capital will flow there until the original financial market's capital is insufficient and its interest rate rises to the same level as the other market. Conversely, if the interest rate in a financial market is higher than elsewhere, capital will flow in to suppress the interest rate until it is equal to that elsewhere. This principle of interest rate fluctuations is also the principle of capital flow. Although the occurrence of interest is often exemplified by profitable ventures, even borrowing that is not used for profit-making is governed by this principle. All economists understand this.</p>
<p>Borrowed capital is not always repaid in full. If borrowers use it for profit-making, they may incur losses and become indebted. If they use it to alleviate urgent needs, they may be unable to repay it. Disasters, both natural and man-made, are unpredictable, and unexpected changes often occur in private finances. With the slightest carelessness, capital may be lost. Lenders inevitably face some risk when lending capital, so who would be willing to do so without the prospect of interest? Therefore, economists also say that interest contains an insurance premium. If the borrower's risk is high, no one will be willing to lend without high interest. While high profits are desirable, security is even more important for lenders. It is better to have low profits with security than to risk high profits. All economists understand this principle.</p>
<p>The interior indeed feels the tightness of credit, and rural areas indeed feel the poverty of capital. However, social unrest, economic decline, and the stagnation of profitable ventures increase the risk of capital deployment. Even if borrowers are willing to bear high interest rates to meet their urgent needs, what can lenders do if they are unwilling to take the risk? In contrast, commercial ports are more stable, have better order, and have some economic prosperity, with more profitable ventures. The purchase and sale of government bonds and real estate, and speculation in gold, silver, and general commodities, are viewed by capitalists and merchants as profitable and reliable. Banks are unwilling to absorb capital without high interest rates. Recently, the interest rate on long-term deposits in banks is often 1% or more. Although interest rates in rural areas are above 2%, the security is far inferior compared to the commercial ports. This is why capital continues to flow out. Furthermore, social unrest in the interior, industrial decline, and trade imbalances have led to a decrease in incoming capital and no increase. In addition, the relocation of wealthy households and the levying of taxes further drive out capital. Capital outflows are as inevitable as water flowing downhill. As capital flows out, lending between individuals in the interior becomes increasingly insufficient to meet demand. Social unrest worsens, and interest rates rise accordingly. There are even those who are willing to pay high interest rates but cannot find lenders. According to economic principles, capital surplus reduces interest rates and exports idle capital. Capital shortage increases interest rates to attract foreign capital. Judging from the phenomenon of capital scarcity in the interior, only increasing interest rates may be sufficient to regulate it. However, commentators loudly advocate abolishing usury, which will only drive away capital. Is this truly beneficial to rural revitalization?</p>
<p>Does usury, then, benefit rural areas? Not at all. When interest rates are high, borrowers are deeply exploited by lenders and become increasingly impoverished. Lenders, on the other hand, become extravagant due to high profits. Both of these impede the people's livelihood and the economy. The right approach is to find ways to equalize interest rates, not to simply call for abolition. Economists often say that economic matters should be governed by economic policies. High interest rates are an economic matter; abolition is a matter of official force; the way to equalize interest rates lies in economic policy. When a powerful central bank in any country encounters tight credit and rising interest rates, it first reduces interest rates and expands lending. This is one method of equalizing interest rates through economic policy. The financial crisis in the United States this spring was also alleviated by the government expanding credit. I believe that the quickest way to regulate rural capital today is to do the same. However, this requires a large-scale undertaking. Does our country's financial industry have the determination to do this? Can the government provide the backing for this? If not, what is the point of talking about abolishing usury?</p>
<p>Moreover, borrowing can only alleviate urgent needs. The rural economy cannot be restored in a short period. Even with large-scale regulation, if industries do not prosper, it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket; the water will come and go quickly, and capital will remain scarce. How can high interest rates be suppressed? Therefore, the only way is to transform rural areas, implement large-scale and mechanized production, and revitalize the economy from the ground up. I have discussed this in detail in my previous article, "Some Personal Views on the Problem of Rural Revitalization." Once rural production is developed, trade deficits can be avoided, and stable livelihoods can be seen. The risk of lending will be reduced, and high interest rates will fall without the need for abolition. Moreover, once industries prosper and society is stable, a credit system can also take shape, and transactions will not require cash. The need for capital will decrease, credit will be loosened, and interest rates will be equalized. Some commentators have recently advocated credit cooperatives, but the fundamental weaknesses of agricultural industries have not been eliminated, and farmers still lack capital. How can they maintain their credit for long? Therefore, I say that the way to equalize interest rates today is to fundamentally transform rural areas.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Saving the Rural Economy by Wang Weisi</h3>
<p>The decline of the rural economy is not just a matter of the interests of farmers and the growth and decline of the national economy; it is related to the safety, prosperity, and survival of the entire nation. Farmers account for the absolute majority of the population in our country. If the absolute majority of the population is trapped in an economic crisis and unable to save themselves, it is like a human body with depleted blood and energy, suffering a great loss of vitality. How can it not be in a dangerous situation? Therefore, in the current situation, saving the rural economy is the way to save the country and prevent national extinction. But to save the rural economy, we must first understand the reasons why rural areas are bankrupt. Here, I will discuss the reasons that can be stated:</p>
<p>(1) The development of foreign industries: Since the free use of mechanized production, various capitalist countries have experienced overproduction and have had to transport and sell their products to the industrially backward China at low prices. Moreover, because foreign transportation is more convenient and cheaper than domestic transportation, the domestic market is filled with foreign industrial and agricultural products, and domestic goods have no way to be sold, fundamentally shaking the rural economy. (2) The rise of domestic mechanical industries: At present, mechanical industries in major domestic cities are gradually rising, competing with foreign industrial products in the market. Farmers' handicrafts have been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>(3) Exploitation by the petty bourgeoisie: The petty bourgeoisie in the interior have discovered the instability of the rural economy. Investment in rural areas is uncertain, so they have invested the cash they have extracted from farmers in urban areas or engaged in other businesses. Rural cash is indirectly concentrated in urban areas, and farmers' production capital cannot be circulated, reducing production. The rural economy is becoming even more exhausted. (4) The impact of years of disasters: In addition, there are floods, droughts, and wars every year. Like a declining old man suffering from continuous attacks of wind and cold, the rural economy has fallen into an irrecoverable state. (5) Farmers' overly conservative mentality: They are unwilling to accept new knowledge and cannot adapt to the modern environment. In addition, they are unorganized and lack unity, so all public welfare undertakings cannot be undertaken. Due to these reasons, the collapse of the rural economy is inevitable.</p>
<p>The cash concentrated in urban areas is not invested in various industrial and commercial enterprises but is mostly used for buying and selling government bonds and real estate. Therefore, its contribution to productive enterprises is minimal. Farmers, on the other hand, suffer from a shortage of rural funds, leaving them without the means to cultivate their land, and farming comes to a standstill. Now, to regulate the rural areas on the verge of bankruptcy with urban unproductive funds, it cannot be done by a small number of people. The banking industry is the only one that can take on this important mission.</p>
<p>The banking industries of European and American countries are inextricably linked to the emergence and development of domestic industry and commerce. Developed industry and commerce are a prerequisite for the development of banking business, while the development of banking business can promote the progress of industry and commerce. The banking industry has a responsibility to assist and regulate industry and commerce, and assisting and regulating industry and commerce is also the way to promote the development of the banking business itself. The two sides have a relationship of mutual assistance. In the past few decades, new banks have sprung up like mushrooms in our country, and the financial industry cannot be said to be underdeveloped. However, industry and commerce remain immature and declining, indicating that the banking industry has not established a close relationship with industry and commerce. Especially in rural areas, there are no banks, and farmers are completely unaware of the nature of banking business. Moreover, with the rural economy already in a state of bankruptcy, from the perspective of ensuring its own business, the banking industry cannot invest in rural areas without reliable guarantees. Therefore, the two sides have not yet established a deep relationship, which is due to objective social factors. However, in recent years, our country has been affected by the global economic depression. The banking industry is declining, and the people of the whole country have generally fallen into poverty. The original foundation of banks has been slightly affected. Far-sighted bankers are also eager to seek other outlets. In the context of our country, the social organization is based on rural areas, the production industry is dominated by agriculture, and there is a consensus on discussing and saving the rural economy, hoping that the financial industry will provide economic assistance. Recently, the Shanghai banking industry has established a Rural Financial Regulation Committee, which has resolved to invest in regulating rural areas. There is no doubt about that. The most important point for the banking industry to regulate the rural economy is how to ensure the security of investment. The so-called security guarantee means that after funds flow into rural areas, farmers can absolutely maintain their credit and operate stably, so that investors or rural entrepreneurs will not regard the journey as long and borrowing will not be interrupted. If the investment is guaranteed, it will not only maintain the security of the banking business itself but also attract the joint participation of other enthusiasts in saving the rural economy, making the flow of funds into rural areas easier to generalize. Here, I will study the methods of the banking industry in regulating the rural economy:</p>
<p>(1) Organize a joint rural lending agency: Should banks cooperate fully in regulating rural finance, or should they act independently? This should be discussed first. In my opinion, at present, all banks other than the Farmers Bank can only contribute their surplus strength to regulating rural finance, because each bank has its main business and cannot operate with full effort. Moreover, this kind of business cannot be effective without a large amount of financial resources, which cannot be achieved by the strength of one or two banks. Therefore, the Shanghai banking industry should immediately organize a joint lending agency. The method of investment can be as follows: each bank contributes its strength, or allocates funds according to the content of the bank, with the principle of not hindering its own foundation. If there is a willingness to increase investment, it is naturally more beneficial. Lending affairs can be handled by a separately organized joint rural head office and branch offices, and future profits and losses will be distributed in proportion to the investment of each bank. This method makes it easy to collect funds and poses no risk to the investing bank itself. Even if the loan is completely stagnant or cannot be recovered, because the investment was allocated according to the bank's capacity, it will not affect its main business. Moreover, in fact, if handled properly, this will never happen. This move will actually benefit the banks in many ways. Since the January 28th Incident, cash has been concentrated in Shanghai, and bank deposits have not been fully utilized due to the decline of commerce. This can be used to activate surplus funds. Therefore, the joint lending agency organized by banks can be said to be a beneficial method of regulating rural finance.</p>
<p>(2) Run agricultural pawnshops: For the past two years, rice prices have plummeted, and all agricultural products produced by farmers are cheap. They want to wait for an opportunity to get a good price, but they are forced to sell their goods to pay debts and meet their daily needs. The losses incurred as a result are enormous. If the Shanghai banking industry can pay attention to the rice-producing areas in the interior, especially in rural areas (agricultural pawnshops are not limited to rice, but rice is the main agricultural product in the Jiangnan area, used as an example), and establish warehouses. In places where banks have already been established, the banks will handle the pawnshop business. In places where banks have not been established, it is best for the banks to jointly raise funds to establish temporary offices, or entrust local fair gentry to organize grain storage warehouses. If farmers encounter a sharp drop in rice prices and are unwilling to sell immediately, but are in urgent need of funds, they can mortgage their grain and borrow money. This kind of loan is completely risk-free because it is secured by agricultural products. With this pledge, farmers do not have to sell their grain at low prices, avoiding various losses. The reduction in agricultural products on the market will naturally raise prices, and the income from higher prices will still go to farmers. For banks, this provides a reliable lending opportunity, which does not lose sight of the purpose of regulating rural finance and is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>The most urgent measures for the banking industry to regulate rural finance are the two mentioned above. However, we must know that the reasons for hindering rural revitalization are not limited to one. Externally, there is imperialist aggression, and internally, there is the oppression and exploitation of warlords, bandits, local bullies, and corrupt gentry. Inconvenient transportation, lack of education, exorbitant taxes, and unstable politics are all fatal injuries to the rural economy. Bank regulation of rural finance can only prevent farmers from being exploited by high interest rates, but cannot prevent other more severe exorbitant taxes. Therefore, it can be seen that saving the rural economy cannot be achieved solely by bank financial regulation but depends on more from the government. The most pressing expectations are: (1) Develop transportation and abolish exorbitant taxes: Our country is vast and transportation is inconvenient, making commodity transportation difficult. In addition, in remote provinces, warlords occupy territory, each province governs itself, and they levy taxes indiscriminately. As a result, agricultural products transported from province A to province B cost more than similar foreign goods transported across the ocean due to high transportation costs and frequent taxes, making them difficult to sell. The market is completely encroached upon by foreign goods. Even the circulation of goods in various places is impossible. On the one hand, supply exceeds demand and prices plummet. On the other hand, production is lacking, and supply cannot meet demand. As a result, there are places where rice is wasted, and places where starvation is widespread. It can be seen that the obstruction of transportation exacerbates the difficulties of farmers. In addition to suppressing bandits, the government should abolish exorbitant taxes and actively manage transportation affairs between rural areas and cities, so that they are linked together. This will facilitate the transportation of agricultural products, disseminate information, and prevent the mismatch between supply and demand of agricultural products in various places.</p>
<p>(2) Promote rural education: Schools and all cultural undertakings in our country are mostly established in cities. In remote rural areas, with the exception of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, where there are still some elementary schools, other provinces are far from being universal. Most farmers are ignorant of the size of the country, the social situation, and agricultural common sense. No wonder they are at the mercy of others, and all undertakings in rural areas are controlled by a few people. The bankruptcy of the rural economy in our country can be attributed to the ignorance of farmers, who are unable to form self-help and mutual aid organizations. To popularize rural education and increase farmers' knowledge is an essential plan for the present. The government should immediately allocate funds to establish civilian schools in rural areas of various provinces, providing farmers with the opportunity to enroll for free. According to the needs of the environment, agricultural science departments should be added to the schools, and rural guidance centers should be established to engage in agricultural research and guidance. They should strengthen ties with nearby farmers and send people to give lectures at farmers' gathering places, so that those who cannot enroll or are illiterate can also gain considerable knowledge. The fields around the rural schools should also be used as agricultural experiment fields. It is best to designate a portion of the experiment fields as model farms, using the latest methods to cultivate and obtain abundant harvests, so that farmers in general will have faith in scientific methods and follow suit. In addition, civic education is also needed. The imparting of civic knowledge, the construction of rural self-governance, and the organization of defense corps or cooperatives all rely on the guidance and training of civic education, so that farmers can eliminate selfish views, unite as a group, and consolidate the foundation of the country and society. There is one more point that should be worked on by the farmers themselves, with guidance and assistance from the government and financial institutions: the organization of rural credit cooperatives. Credit cooperatives are organizations that pool capital to operate credit lending, providing farmers with the capital necessary for production. The need for cooperatives is known to all. However, this kind of organization does not require a large amount of capital like the Farmers Bank, making it easy for local farmers to establish. Therefore, at this time, the government and the financial sector should provide strong assistance to promote it, and crack down on unscrupulous township chiefs and others who use the name of cooperation to exploit ignorant farmers, manipulate cooperative affairs, and seek personal gain. Farmers' loans should be subject to proper restrictions, generally limited to capital for seeds, fertilizers, sericulture, animal husbandry, and other production purposes. If it is discovered that borrowers are using the funds for improper or inappropriate purposes, a corresponding fine can be levied, and their borrowing rights can be suspended as appropriate, so that all borrowed funds are used to promote agricultural credit cooperation. In addition to regulating agricultural finance, credit cooperatives should also operate production, storage, transportation, sales, and utilization businesses to enrich their content and strengthen their organization. At the same time, they should conduct detailed investigations of the local rural economy and promote appropriate rural sideline industries based on the results of the investigations, such as sericulture, chicken farming, sheep farming, etc.</p>
<p>The above sections, though ordinary, will be beneficial to farmers if they can gain the attention of government authorities and financial leaders and be put into practice. This is no small matter.</p>

<p>Securities: Bond Market Quiet Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, from August 21st to 26th, was the last week for futures trading in August at the Chinese Securities Exchange. In the past, there would always be a flurry of activity with both longs and shorts trying to squeeze each other. However, there were no signs of mutual squeeze last week, and the market was very sluggish, mostly in a state of consolidation. This was a special phenomenon that has not been seen in months, as the delivery date approached. The overall environment was dull. After a large amount of No. 46 bonds were sold off previously, the existing shorts had made considerable profits, and the No. 46 bonds that were released were not being replenished. Therefore, the long side suddenly felt crowded, so the market price was sluggish and unable to rise last week. However, the longs only rolled over their positions and did not panic, so the market was sluggish but stable. Trading did not immediately improve due to the change to a three-session day. Monday was a day of consolidation, with fluctuations of around 0.02 yuan. On Tuesday, the longs rolled over their positions, and the price was sluggish and slightly weak, fluctuating by 0.03-0.04 yuan. On Wednesday, there were sudden rumors of consolidation of the</p>
<h3>Shipping Company Establishment</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Belgian merchants investing in China have been increasing in recent years. Several more individuals arrived in China this month with the intention of establishing a shipping company in the South China region. The Belgian Consulate in Shanghai has received a report regarding this matter. According to sources, the shipping company being planned by these merchants may become a reality by late spring or early summer of next year. Furthermore, it is understood that Chinese investors are involved in this joint venture.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Awakens from Conspiracy to Commit Suicide</h3>
<h3>Suicide is Not for Real Men</h3>
<p>Pan Songbai Sends Telegram Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that three apprentices from the Hengfeng Cotton Fabric Store at 105 Tianjin Road had resolved to leave without saying goodbye and commit suicide together due to lack of freedom in marriage and overly traditional families. This was indeed a peculiar event. Yesterday, we made a special inquiry at the store. According to the person in charge, the report was accurate. However, this morning, a long-distance call was received from Nanjing from Pan Songbai, one of the three apprentices. He had realized that suicide is not for real men and that a way out must be found through hard work and struggle, breaking free from the idea of committing suicide together. It turned out that his companions, Pan Zhanpeng and Shi Bingnan, were determined to commit suicide, refusing to change their minds despite all efforts. Pan Songbai is temporarily looking after them in Nanjing, but he fears that one person cannot manage two, and he has no money. He is requesting that someone be sent to Nanjing immediately to provide assistance. Upon receiving the telegram, the store immediately dispatched someone by train to Nanjing, but it is unknown whether they will be able to return safely.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce Extract Manufacturers Defend Non-Toxicity</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, based on a report from the Songjiang Salt Transportation Deputy Office, stated that Shanghai's soy sauce extract contains arsenic toxins and hinders the sale of government salt. They requested the Municipal Government to investigate and ban it, and attached a list of fourteen soy sauce extract manufacturers. Yesterday, a reporter from the Datong News Agency made a special inquiry at the temporary office organized by the trade association. According to the person in charge, Zhang Nianjun, the Ministry of Finance's ban on soy sauce extract this time is because the name "soy sauce extract" implies the use of private salt, which hinders the sale of government salt. This is far from the truth. Moreover, the fourteen soy sauce extract manufacturers that the Ministry of Finance requested the Municipal Government to investigate are all small businesses, while the well-known manufacturers are not included. It seems that the soy sauce produced by small soy sauce factories must contain arsenic toxins. This seems unfair. The trade association is currently petitioning the relevant authorities to conduct a detailed investigation into whether or not the product is toxic in order to clarify the truth and protect their business.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Restricts Tax Reduction for Machine-Made Foreign Goods Factories</h3>
<p>Must Register with Customs Annually</p>
<p>Regarding the reduction of tariffs for various machine-made foreign goods factories, the Ministry of Finance has recently stated that factories frequently close down or change ownership, resulting in significant abuses. They have now specifically stipulated that all machine-made foreign goods factories must register with customs annually. Those who do not comply with the regulations will be immediately suspended. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency learned from Shanghai's machine-made foreign goods factories that the Ministry of Finance has requested the Ministry of Industry to promptly instruct compliance with the regulations. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>For the purpose of consultation, the Customs Service submitted a case regarding the approval of factories to receive treatment as machine-made foreign goods. After a long period of time, it is inevitable that some have closed down, ceased operations, changed owners, changed names, or changed trademarks, or added new products. It was ordered that the General Affairs Department draft a notice to inform all factories to register with customs annually and to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations at various factories. If there are any of the above-mentioned changes, they should be reported immediately, and the treatment should be suspended or the original case revoked, to prevent abuses and ensure accurate verification. Now, according to the General Taxation Department, the Jianghai, Zhenjiang, Jianghan, and Jinhai Customs Services have investigated the situation of various factories in their respective customs areas that enjoy machine-made foreign goods treatment. After review, except for those that have been closed down or whose factory addresses cannot be found, the original approved cases have been revoked. For factories that do not comply with the regulations and register with customs, the machine-made foreign goods treatment they enjoy will be temporarily suspended or retained depending on the circumstances. Copies of the original investigation reports are enclosed for your ministry's review. We also hope that you will inform the factories whose machine-made foreign goods treatment has been temporarily suspended or retained to register with customs to avoid the penalty of revocation. Sincere greetings.</p>
<p>[P Both Men and Women are Shameless</p>
<p>丨Adultery Results in Four-Month Imprisonment for Each丨</p>
<p>Yang Baofa from Ningbo, 29 years old, married a woman four years ago. They resided at No. 24, Lane 676, Baker Road. Yang worked as a night shift tea server at the Ducheng Hotel at 180 Jiangxi Road, leaving at 8 PM every night and returning at dawn. Therefore, he could not fully attend to Madam Mao's affections. Madam Mao, in the prime of her youth, slept alone every night and could not help but feel lonely. Thus, she was quite cold towards Yang. Yueqing had a widowed sister who recently became acquainted with Wang Lunsheng, a tea server at the New World, and cohabited at No. 448 Aiwenyi Road. Yueqing often visited and became acquainted with Gu Xiangsheng, Wang's cousin. A lonely widower and a discontented wife could not help but feel affection. From then on, they secretly formed a pact and had secret meetings, not just once. Yang discovered this. At 12 PM the night before, he saw Madam Mao and Gu Xiangsheng enter the room together. He waited for about an hour, but they did not come out. Yang then called the police and broke into the room. He found a pair of lovebirds embracing naked in bed. The police woke them up, they put on their clothes, and they were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Wu interrogated them. The police lawyer prosecuted them according to Article 256 of the criminal law. When questioned, Mao Yueqing admitted to adultery with Gu, saying that Binfa did not care about their daily living expenses, and the clothes she wore were also purchased by Gu. Gu Xiangsheng also directly admitted to the adultery. Judge Wu sentenced Gu Xiangsheng and Mao Yueqing to four months of imprisonment each as a warning. Actual Department</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Special Bureau for Trade with Russia</h3>
<p>Can Proceed After Minister Song Returns to China</p>
<p>Since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian goods imported into China have increased dramatically, reportedly fivefold, according to a survey by the International Trade Bureau. However, exports of Chinese goods to Russia have not increased. The reason is that Russia's foreign trade is entirely state-owned, while China's is not. Therefore, the International Trade Bureau reported the dramatic increase in Russian imports to the Ministry of Industry, and Shanghai merchants involved in trade with Russia have paid even more attention to this situation. They have also detailed the losses incurred from exporting Chinese goods to Russia to the Ministry of Industry, requesting assistance. As for the Ministry of Industry's plan to establish a special bureau for trade with Russia, everything is ready and can proceed after Minister Song returns to China.</p>
<h3>Re-election of Farmers' Associations at All Levels in Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Since the term of office for farmers' associations at all levels in Shanghai County's townships and districts is expiring, and the Sixth District still lacks a farmers' association organization, the County Party Committee has decided to guide the re-election and organization separately. However, most farmers' associations are scattered and stagnant, and farmers are also busy with farming, so they have been unable to hold elections on time. The County Party Committee has therefore rescheduled the re-election and organization of farmers' associations at all levels to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Dentist Sun Xiamin Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dental expert Dr. Sun Xiamin went to Japan at the beginning of the month to study Japanese dental medicine. He has now completed his studies and returned to Shanghai and is resuming his practice as usual. Dr. Sun's clinic is located at No. 306, opposite the Mainland Commercial Building, at the east end of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road.</p>
<h3>Cook Steals Owner's Ancient Paintings and is Sentenced</h3>
<p>Lin Erqing from Ningbo, who lives at No. 38 Mainland Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession and works as the chief auditor at the Minghua Bank, had his house broken into on the morning of the 18th of this month at 3 AM by Han Renxun (33 years old), a cook from the same hometown who had been laid off. Han climbed over the wall, smashed the glass window, and sneaked into the study. He obtained the keys from the writing desk drawer, opened the antique storage box, and stole ancient landscape paintings, calligraphy scrolls, albums, and jade stones by famous artists such as Wen Zhengming, Wang Shigu, and Dong Qichang, worth six to seven thousand yuan, and fled. He hid the stolen goods in his residence at No. 13 Anna King Road, intending to take them to Hankou by boat that night to sell. At dawn, the owner discovered the theft and reported it to the police. After investigation by detectives Li Liansheng and Bao Tan Li Tiqing, Han was arrested at 5 PM that afternoon and all the stolen goods were recovered and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The previous report has already noted these details. The case was continued in the Criminal Court 1 by Judge Wang the other day. The police sent the stolen goods to the court, and the owner Lin Zhiyun went to the court to state the situation of the theft. When interrogated, Han admitted to stealing due to unemployment and poverty. After reviewing the evidence in court, the defendant was immediately sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for burglary at night as a warning. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<p>Husband Sues Wife for Infidelity</p>
<h3>Refuses to Elaborate on Adultery</h3>
<p>丨Result: Court Dismisses the Case丨</p>
<p>Chen Lu, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 322 Zhaofeng Road, 22 years old, is quite flirtatious and somewhat attractive. From January to March of this year, she had a physical relationship with her landlord Song Afei, 21 years old, and went to a hotel on Xizang Road for adultery four times while her husband Chen Jintao was away. The affair was kept secret, but Chen Jintao recently found out. He reported it to the Huishan Police Station a few days ago, and detectives were ordered to arrest Song Afei and Chen. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Court 5 of the First Special District Court. Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendant Song Afei denied having adultery with Chen Lu at the police station. However, this case concerns public morals, and he requested that irrelevant people be prohibited from attending the hearing. The court approved the request. Subsequently, the plaintiff Chen Jintao was questioned. His testimony was vague and he refused to elaborate on the facts of adultery. He also stated that he did not want to pursue the matter. Chen Lu's abdomen was bulging as if she was about to give birth, and her testimony was also evasive. Judge Huang then ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning in Hotel</h3>
<p>Signed as Hong Ping</p>
<p>The Jiaotong Hotel at No. 12 West New Bridge Street (ie, Bali Bridge Street) in the French Concession, suddenly had a young traveler arrive at around 8 PM the night before (26th). He signed as Hong Ping, from Ningbo, 19 years old, and worked in the printing industry. After the hotel bookkeeper registered the name, the bellboy led him to Room 5 upstairs. After paying the room fee, he closed the door and went to sleep. Until 11 AM yesterday morning, the young man had not gotten up. The bellboy Fang Aqing knocked on the door, urging him to get up quickly. However, after calling for a long time, there was still no sound in the room. Realizing that something was wrong, he tried to pry open the door and went inside to check. He saw the young man lying stiffly on the bed, his face pale and barely breathing. It was clear that he had committed suicide by poisoning. He immediately reported it to the police. After investigating, the police rushed him to Renji Hospital in a car. Due to severe poisoning, the rescue was ineffective and he died at 1 PM that afternoon. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Auxiliary Hall mortuary for examination. Because no family members were found, the truth of his suicide could not be determined. It was reported to the Second Special District Court today for inspection.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoxing Dies in Prison</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoxing from Chongming, 24 years old, was previously arrested in the French Concession and sentenced to imprisonment by the Second Special District Court for committing a crime. He was sent to the Second Special Prison. He became ill in prison and died yesterday morning at 1:20 AM despite medical treatment. The warden reported it to the Second Special District Court, and a prosecutor was dispatched to the prison to verify that the deceased had indeed died from illness. Because no relatives were found, the body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for burial. The eight pieces of clothing, both Chinese and Western, left behind were also handed over to the hall for safekeeping, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<p>Chou Pinfu Chops His Elder Brother</p>
<h3>Further Interrogation After Brother Fully Recovers</h3>
<p>Chou Pinfu from Haimen, 22 years old, lives at No. 63 near the Sports Association on Jiangwan Road and works in a leather factory. He has a gambling habit and was reprimanded by his elder brother Pin Cai. He was dissatisfied at the time, which led to a physical fight. They were separated by others. On the morning of the 18th of this month at 6 AM, Pinfu hid a sharp blade and waited near the Sports Association. When Pin Cai passed by, he went forward and stabbed his elder brother in the neck, causing him to fall to the ground injured. The Chinese detective Tan Jinhai saw this and took Pinfu to the First Special District Court. The various details of the case have already been reported in the newspaper. Judge Xiao Xiepan presided over the trial the other day. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the injuries suffered by the victim Chou Pincai were severe and he was still being treated in the hospital and could not come to court for questioning. The judge then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and to be interrogated again after the injured party fully recovered.</p>
<p>Daughter of a Policeman</p>
<h3>Enticed into Adultery and Abduction</h3>
<p>Jiao Shousheng from Hebei, 39 years old, joined the cavalry patrol team of the former Songhu Police Department in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. After five years, the team was reorganized into the First Security Team, and Jiao remained a member. He moved his wife and children from his hometown to Shanghai. The following year, the Police Department was reorganized into the Public Security Bureau, and Jiao was transferred to the Second Station of the Third District in Pudong as a policeman. Because his monthly salary was only nine yuan, it was difficult to support a family of four. Therefore, in March of the eighteenth year, he entrusted someone to recommend his twelve-year-old daughter, Changju, to work in the Yizhong Electrical Factory in order to earn some wages to supplement the household income. Now, four years have passed, and Changju has reached the age of sixteen. She has grown up to be very beautiful, attracting the attention of Huang Yansong, an employee of the factory. Working in the same factory, Huang took the opportunity to seduce her in every possible way. Changju's will was weak and she was seduced. On a holiday on January 1st of this year, Huang enticed her to the factory and raped her. From then on, the two became even closer and had secret affairs many times, leading to pregnancy in March, unbeknownst to Jiao. On the</p>
