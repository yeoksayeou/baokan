<h3 id="c18">銀價提高於中國之影響實 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>近年世界經濟恐慌。日益急劇。白銀乃由貴金屬而退與一般商品同其地位。不復能持測度物價之準尺。遂在世界市塲中漲跌不定。同於物價之浮沉。我國爲用銀之國。近雖廢兩改元。然貨幣制度。尙未完成統一。故在過去四年（自一九二九年經濟恐慌開始至現在）受銀價跌落之影響。格外嚴重。其中尤以轉輸外國商品之進口貿易。吃虧最甚。自聞提高銀價穏定金銀價。値比率之提議。莫不欣欣然有喜色。以爲我國輸出入貿易。將萌生機。挽回經濟頽勢之希望。殆將不遠乎。而我恐其未必然也。頃者世界經濟會議。已將政治有關之問題。擱起不談。即安定通貨。亦不能不暫時任其自然變化。則今所可得而討論者。僅此白銀問題耳。</p>
<p>金銀二者間之比價。自一九二一以迄於一九二九年間。尙稱安定。最近三年間。則竟跌至於百分之五十以上。其所以如此氏落。在一般推論者。皆以爲綠於需要與供給關係。而白銀爲貨幣所排斥。如美國之毀棄輔助銀幣。印度之出脫藏銀。供給過多白銀又爲其他鑛業之副產物。於是銀價低落。遂如江河之日下。實則此種趨勢。早醖釀於世界恐慌發動之前。以世界產銀總數論。一九三○年爲七百七十萬又四千公斤。一九三一年僅六百零二萬五千公斤。一九三二年不過五百萬公斤而已。其逐年减少之數目。並非細微。而白銀之需要。如在我國内地。匪特未嘗稍减。且正渴望增加。然則供給與需要不相應之說。殊乏强固之理由矣。其實白銀之爲物。亦已成爲商品之一種。一般物價跌至水準以下。白銀即隨之而下。今日物價高漲白銀亦同時乘潮而上。其所以暴跌暴漲之原因。蓋在此耳。自複本位制之說起。美國且倡以白銀爲通貨準備金之一。而複本位制度。徵之歷史上之經騐。僅予先進諸國以惡劣之映象。其結果猶之以劣幣驅除良幣。單獨一國。恐無敢冒險嘗試者。故祗有求之於國際的合作。以運用此金銀二者併用之制度。設使此議果在經濟會議席上。得適當之决議。且又能見諸實施。則白銀將再恢復其貴金屬之地位。與黄金間成立固定比價。則銀價自然提高矣。	銀價提高之後世界通貨平價减低之影響如何。我姑不論。而一述關於我國影響之所見如下。</p>
<p>在樂觀方面。以爲銀價穏定。我國對外貿易。不致再受意外之牽制。輸入貨品。在計算上亦具一定準則。尤其是滬漢等地以商業爲中心之市塲。與外國貨幣結算之際。不致感受朝夕價格不同之威脅。而舶來品價格略低。亦足令一般消費者得轉旋之餘地。則市面繁榮。大有希望。然而在另一方面觀察。銀價旣經提高。有形貿易之輸入。超過將至無可避免而更見增加。其他貿易以外之國際收支。我國僅有華僑勞苦剩餘之零星匯欵。現在各地華僑。均蒙經濟恐慌影響。此種無形輸入。勢必减少。於是國内現貨。將因銀價高漲關係而不斷流出海外。即少數集中現銀之大都市。亦將有貨幣價値高漲之虞。則一般物價。必相對的减低。在我國幼穉之產業界。旣受外來製品之排擠。又感物價低落之脅制。發達固不可期。維持現狀。勢亦不易。至於一般大衆與農村。在銀價低落期間。已感受硬貨缺乏幣制混亂之苦痛一旦銀價提高。則現貨將愈集中。通貨收縮之趨勢。必更嚴重。故無論爲工銀勞動者。爲手工業工人爲農人其收入以貨幣計値。者皆將不免减少。若是則一般社會之消費能力。必愈形低落。各國已往所受經濟恐慌之厄運。恐將重現於我國矣。準此以觀提高銀價之結果。在世界不過希望其能彌補現金偏在之缺失。而在我中國則將不免益陷於悲境也。</p>

<p>蘇聯財政預算之特點、爲不以稅收爲惟一之收入基礎、而以國營生產事業之一部分盈餘爲收入之大宗、支出方面、不以政費軍費爲最大之支出、而以用於經營各種生產·文化·建設·事業之經費爲最鉅、故蘇聯財政預算、實爲集各個生產部門預算之大成、其基礎實建立在工業·農業·及運輸·等等生產事業之各種預算上面、此外尙有信用、社會·保險·等等亦爲其重要基礎、申言之、此項預算、實負有集中與分配發展社會主義、經濟之資本、及向國民集中資金、與分配資金於國民之使命、與資本主義國家之財政預算完全不同、至於製定預算之機關、則設有專門委員會於中央執行委員會之下、該委員會專司製定中央及各個聯邦財政預算之職、而各部之預算、又爲成立中央預算之基礎、至於地方預算、則由所在地之執行委員會製定之、</p>
<p>茲述本年財政預算如次、一九三三年適爲第二個五年計劃開始之年、亦即爲蘇聯國民經濟第二個發展階段開始之年、本年計劃中、預定工業生產總額應較去年增加百分之一六·五、如以金額而言、則增加値價四十八億盧布之工業生產品、（依一九二六至二七之價格計）、鐵路運</p>
<p>輸方面、預期可以增加三萬萬噸之貨運、依百分計算爲百分之一二·五、投資總額可達一百八十億盧布、貿易方面、可以增加六十億盧布之資本、財政預算之收支、已經中央執行委員會下之預算及財政計劃部通過者、計收入爲三百五十億盧布、支出爲三百三十二億盧布、與一九三二年較、預算全部增加五十億盧布（２９９４９Ｍill增至３５０１１Ｍill盧布）、依百分計爲百分之一六·九、支出項下、因有政府盈餘十七萬八千萬盧布在内、故無顯著之增加、</p>
<p>（甲）收入茲將一九三二年與一九三三年之收入列表比較如下、</p>
<p>一九三二年　　　　　　　　　　　一九三三年</p>
<p>金額（百萬盧布）收入總額之百分比　金額（百萬盧布）收入總額之百分比</p>
<p>項目</p>
<p>國民經濟之社會化者　　二四七一九　一八二·五　二八七四九　八二·一</p>
<p>已經集中之民間資本　　　四三七三　一一四·六　　五三六四　一五·三</p>
<p>其他（如租稅等）　　　　　八五七　　一二·九　　　八九八　　二·六</p>
<p>總計　　　　　　　　　二九九四九　一○○·○　三五○一一　一○○·○</p>
<p>已經社會化之國民經濟方面之主要收入有二、其一爲經營商業方面者、此項收入之形式爲營業稅、其次由各種經濟組織盈餘項下撥歸政府者、如工業·農業·等企業之盈餘、鐵路·郵政·有綫電報·及無綫電報·之收入等、</p>
<p>營業稅之收入、在財政預算收入中作第一位、總額爲二百十八億盧布、或爲全部收入之百分之六二·四、至於此項稅收之增益、須觀生產狀况及負有納稅義務之商業狀况而定、此外工業品生活必須品之售價如有變化、有時亦足以影響各項貨物之營業稅、一九三三年預算中、稅率之變化極小、因而得以保持一九三二年之平均稅率、一九三三年營業稅所以能比一九三二年加多至四十四億盧布者、其原因實由於納稅之貿易比以前旺盛、其比較如下、（單位百萬盧布）</p>
<p>年份　　　　納稅貿易總數　　稅額　　　平均稅率以百分算</p>
<p>一九三二　　四三八一七　　一七二二七　　三九·三</p>
<p>一九三三　　五四七二一　　二一七九六　　三九·七</p>
<p>一九三三對一九三二之百分比　一二四·九　三六·八　一○一·○</p>
<p>如能再依一九三二年之賣價計算之特殊生產品出售以後、所徵之稅列入前項預算之收入項下、收入總額可達二百三十五億盧布、或佔全部收入之百分之六七·二、由此可見收入方面有三分之二必須視國家商品貿易之情况而轉移、所幸目前市塲之需要甚切、即預計一九三三年增加之百分之一六·五、工業生產品、亦尙不能應國民及社會化部份之需要、</p>
<p>預算中第二種重要收入爲工業、信用機關及交通方面之蓄積、社會化部分之蓄積、總額决定爲二百零二億盧布、此項蓄積總額之來源爲依計劃規定之加緊生產、增加貨運、减低工業生產品之成本、以及增加工人生產能力等、此項蓄積數額之中、須以三十九億列入財政預算收入之中、</p>
<p>預算收入方面之第二項爲稅收、曁人民所納之稅、或自由捐助之費、人民所納之稅爲所得稅、納此種稅者、爲以重價雇用之工人·職員·以及並不工作而有收入之人民、（工商企業之所有人等）至於捐欵、則用以補助發展文化及社會事業者、此外亦有以捐欵抵償、只能勞動而不能繳稅之農民所應納之稅額者、此種稅收之總額爲二十一萬萬五千二百萬盧布、作收入總額之百分之六·一、第二項收入較去年增加三萬八千萬盧布、增加之原因、爲各個國民經濟部門之職工薪工增加、農業增加、勞動人數增多所致、</p>
<p>依合理的公債形式所募集之人民自由捐、在收入方面之意義甚爲重要、一部分經濟建設、均藉此向人民募集之公債而舉辦者、年來因經濟建設正在劇進之中、人民生活亦因經濟建設之進步與擴大而日見安定、此種現象、實不啻爲國家增保證公債之堅固壁壘、故凡政府發公債之時、人民無不踴躍購募、政府負債、截至一九三三年一月一日止、爲六十五億盧布、益</p>
<p>以一九三三年必須再行募集之各種公債、至一九三四年一月一日、總額當可達九十億盧布、至於公債與人民之關係、當以持券人之多寡爲斷、蘇聯購買公債、之人民、在一九二八年爲八百萬人、一九三零年一千二百萬人、至一九三二年增至四千萬人、公債之撥入預算收入項下者爲三十二萬一千二百萬盧布、即收入之百</p>
<p>分之九·三、</p>
<p>其他收入方面、一九三三年共計有五萬萬盧布、此爲最高社會保險機關補助大學獎學金之欵、此欵所以列入預算之故、因欲使獎學金之計算比較簡捷、社會保險機關所撥之獎金、實際祗佔總額之一部分、而其他部分仍須另行設法挹注、此外收入項下之雜欵、尙有零星稅欵（一萬四千萬盧布）貨運曁客運收入撥解政府之欵（一萬八千三百萬盧布）等等、（待續）</p>

<p>事亦難免、坐是彼此猜忌日深、二度政變之因、胚胎予是、當中央特派黄慕松爲宣慰使時、倘立時啓節、輕車簡從、飛往迪化、則馬仲英尙無再逞之心、劉盛或無過分之想、斯時、因勢利導、均無不可、不幸黄氏因羅致人才、籌維經濟、而稽其行、旣達新省、又値陶陳正懐厥望之時、陶等以黄乃中央大員、背言獻媚、斯本小人之長、黄固胸地無他、顧盛劉戒懼之心益亟、遂憑片面之動作、殺陶之不足、并疑黄有奪我之心也、</p>

<p>京滬·津浦·兩路直達通車問題、自經鐵道部組織兩路通車籌備委員會積極進行籌劃後、各項手續、均己擬有具體辦法、再經一度會議討論、正式决定後、即可將留滬之長江號下關渡輪、駛京裝置、茲述各項消息錄後、</p>
<h3 id="c101">擬定通車原則 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>京滬·津浦·兩籌備委員會、係由鐵部派員、會同津浦·京滬·兩路代表合組成立、並經再度召集會議、討論輪渡管理及籌備兩路直達通車等問題、對於通車方面、現由該會擬定下列三項原則、㈠自京滬·津浦·兩路正式通車之日起規定滬·平·每日對開客車一次、（時刻未定）㈡由各路合共抽調客車七列、（輛數未定）專駛滬平通車、㈢上項各路應撥列車、以各路里程爲比例、計津浦五列、北寗一列京滬一列、（上列辦法係由通車籌備委會所擬定、但京滬滬杭甬兩路管理局、以京滬路車輛頗感缺乏、故現已呈請鐵部、改向膠濟路商借三等客車三輛、平漢路二等客車二輛、兩路本身調撥貨車三輛、混合組成一列車）、以上三項原則、日内即由籌備委會呈送鐵道部、予以核准、佈告施行、</p>

<p>至於旅客過江輪渡票價、經通車籌委會議决下關江面爲十里、（實僅六七里）計頭二等三角、四三等爲一角七分、貨物運費、上行由南京至浦口每噸爲一元五角、下行由浦口至南京每噸爲二元、但最多一次、不得超過一千二百噸、惟鐵道當局、以此項辦法易啓客商反對、蓋貨物旣係同一渡輪裝運、過江費不應上下行收取不同、殊將影響京滬·津浦·兩路直達貨運、爲减輕客商負担起見、頃已指令籌委會、將貨物過江運費、在可能範圍内、儘量予以减低、並須取消上行下行名日、劃一收費、</p>

<h3 id="c151">國際貿易局發表斐島華僑商業現况 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>經營米糖蔴椰木材爲基本</p>
<p>受不景氣之影響各業不振</p>
<p>實業部國際貿易局指導處、昨日發表斐島華僑土產商營業現况、原文云、斐島土產、以米糖蔴椰木材烟葉爲大宗華僑經商於此、多數以是項土產爲基本、年來受不景氣之影響、殊形不振、而去歲情形、尤較以前爲甚、茲將一年來華僑土產商營業槪况、分述如下、</p>
<h3 id="c152">米市穏定 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>斐島米業、百分之八十在華僑之手、勢力雄厚、當全盛時代、大有左右市面之權、今則時勢變遷、大異往昔、蓋年來土產跌價、斐人經濟發生恐慌、因而改良玉蜀黍之類者甚多、米之銷路大受影響、其輸出國外者、僅値斐幣三萬餘元、較之前年之八萬餘元、相差幾及兩倍、茲幸去歲市價尙穏、（每包在斐幣五元左右）華僑各米商尙少虧折、</p>
<h3 id="c153">糖業不振 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>以前華僑在斐島糖業、頗有一部分勢力、六七年來、歐美及斐人所設之大規模糖廠、成立多處、製法新頴、貨質優良、華商大受打擊、查斐島糖產、大部銷諸美國、去年全斐糖產約一千四百萬担内一千三百萬担行銷美國、我華商所經營者均係斐島内地貿易、并無出口、際此經濟恐慌、斐人購</p>
<p>買力减少、營頗爲不振、</p>
<h3 id="c154">苧產减少 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>斐島苧產數量、以前與年俱增、近年價格益跌落、農民種植者以無利可圖、出產已日漸减少、去年苧蔴、在國外銷塲、以日本爲最佳、故除日本在斐之苧商、獲有相當利益外、餘均無利可圖、華僑營此業者、年來以虧折而放棄者、已屬不少、此後將益形减少矣、</p>
<h3 id="c155">椰商虧損 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>去年華僑椰利、無利可獲、與前年同、原因由於同業不能合作、蓋其向農民收買椰乾時、互增收價、成本旣昂、復不能待善價而沽、結果甚至有虧折者、補救之法、非力圖合作、不爲功、</p>
<h3 id="c156">木材衰落 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>斐島華僑木商以前曾獲厚利、現則黄金時代已過、竟至虧折矣、而去年情形、尤爲十年來最衰退者、考木業衰退之原因、不外營業競爭、供過於求、價格跌落三端、蓋六七年來華僑木山增加八十餘處之多、（現在共有八百處左右）在三年前銷路廣闊、供求相符、營業興盛時、利益固佳、今則國外貿易幾乎斷絶、而在本島、亦以經濟恐慌、建築减少、銷路亦不如前、補救辦法、最要在减少產量、供求相應、競爭自無價格自然上升矣、</p>
<h3 id="c157">煙稅增重 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>去歲斐島經營者、無論外商抑華商、均無利可獲、原因以出口烟葉减少、此斐政府烟葉之厘稅至重、亦阻碍發展、補救之法、非推廣出口烟葉市塲、及斐政府增加外國香烟人口稅、不能收效云云、</p>
<h3 id="c158">蜀商公所籲請振濟川北難民 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>

<p>奔馳、適當江水大漲、而船隻又先爲退軍把持、除臨時爭渡、溺斃三千餘人外、計男女老幼、逃往顺慶者、約五六萬人、逃往潼川綿州者、又約四五萬人、迄今野處雜居、無人救濟、川中軍閥、忙於私鬥、毫不過問、且認難民之中、雜有共匪反而禁止通行他處、致刻走頭無路、無衣無食、若不急救、只有束手待斃、此達到城鎭者尙且如此、其他逃出衝散、不識方向、流落於歧途者、又不下二三萬人、其慘狀情形、更非筆墨所能形容於萬一、各方紛紛來函、請求向申慈善機關、各大善士、廣爲勸募、儘速將欵兌渝、以便趕往前方、從事救濟、並云愈速愈佳、遲恐無及等語、敝會目覩時艱、明知災遍各省、貴會救濟不遑、但舍僅有之貴會諸公、又何從而呼籲、且查間中等縣、災情實重、確因地處偏陲、交通閉塞、外面少</p>
<p>知、今請派員調查、方知上述不虚、茲特敬懇貴會諸公、大發慈悲、慨予振救、匪特垂斃災民、得沾二天、卽敝會同人、亦感身受矣、謹此奉懇、敬請濟生大會慈善諸公鈞鑒、蜀商公益會謹啟、</p>

<h3 id="c200">作这有與草莓 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 古飛</p>
<p>有人說，某一個社會層出身的作家祗能寫出那一個社會層的作品，因爲他們不能不忠實於他們底生活。</p>
<p>這高論，驟然一看，是大可以使人佩服的。無論怎樣「横暴」的批評家，總不至於「命令」作家去說假龍。</p>
<p>但過細想一想，又覺得有些懷疑。第一；照這個說法，好像一個人底社會存在狀况，是被閻羅王前生注定了，不能變動似的。但實際上的情形却不一定如此。譬如說，富裕的農民變成苦力，學生進工廠，還有極端的例子，大學士拖黄包車。固然，文學家是國民中的優秀份子，應該從心所欲，但如果他或她也是社會的存在的話，怎樣能夠永遠「泰山石敢當」地坐在花香鳥語的地帶裏呢？第二，某一個社會層的作家却並不一定能夠懂得那個社會層的生活。這例子很多，譬如說，現在大喊小資產階級革命文學的作家們，就没有一個能夠刻盡出小資產階級苦難的命運。同樣，雖然不是那個社會層的出身，却能向那個社會層突進，而融合，而成長。如像法兌葉夫，巴比塞，小林多喜二····</p>
<p>這關鍵在什麽地方呢？說出來是一樣的話，是在乎作家忠實或不忠實於生活這一點。但也有點不同：這裏所說的生活，不是指的僅僅從狹小的經騐上所設定的永久不變的抽象東西，而是指的與動的社會相關聯的實踐。而這裏面就包含有人底認識之能動的作用。</p>
<p>今天讀到七月份『中央公論』上的立野信之底『草莓』。在這樣的暑天，看到『草莓』這個名詞就很容易聯想到『草莓牛奶』那樣好的解渴食品的。但這小說裏面却没有一點這樣的香氣。有的是，以種划莓這件事爲故事搆成的主眼，農村經濟底變遷，農民底困苦，由困苦和拚命的勞動所起的悲劇，以至覺醒的經過。這裏面，關於農村社會結構的解剖，關於各種種植問題如肥料氣候的說明，關於農民感情的刻畫，都不是專憑一點經騐可以做得到的。不用說，立野氏是一個知識份子，但他底創作活動並没有被小的經騐範圍所囚住。這小說，就說明了他底努力。</p>
<p>然而，我們的『作家』除了坐在房裏在白紙上寫揭起什麽旗子一類的大文以外，關於草莓研究之類的事，是不悄一顧的。</p>
<h3 id="c201">秋田雨雀的五十年 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 索原</p>
<p>被稱爲「日本的高爾基」的秋田雨雀，本年是他誕生五十週年的紀念。</p>
<p>秋田以一八八三年生於日本東北的靑森縣。在日俄戰爭時代，受了當時非戰論的影響，變成了片山潛幸德秋水等日本初期社會主義運動的支持者。從一九○五年以後，他才出現於文壇，最初是寫詩，小說，逐漸對於戲曲創作發生了興味，先後發表了「幻影與夜曲」「埋了的春」「靑年戲曲家」等等集子。</p>
<p>世界大戰的時候，父親和兒子的相繼死亡，和生活的漸趨貧困，使他一時陷入了消極與虚無的絶境。那時他研究托爾斯泰的宗教論，印度哲學。這個時期發表了「三個靈魂」和「佛陀之死」。</p>
<p>從一九一九至一九二六，在日本眞是多難之秋。因大戰後全國民衆的貧窮化而掀起了德謨克拉西運動，在文化上也有「民衆藝術」運動，這個運動不久就發展到了所謂「第四階級的藝術」。關於這個時期，秋田在他的自叙傳「我的五十年」中寫道：「我聽見了我走著的地面底下沸騰起來的聲音。」</p>
<p>一九二一年，產生了光明運動，接著成立了「蒔種人」的團體。也就在這時期，他以異常的熱心學習世界語（Ｅsperauto）用他自己的話來說：「世界語把我改變成爲全然不同的另外一人了。我覺得，我因世界語而得救了。我方始成爲一個明朗而活潑的世界人。什麽文壇，簡直是個獗窄而可厭的地方。」</p>
<p>一九二七年十月，秋田以國賓的資格，被邀往蘇聯出席革命的十週紀念。</p>
<p>留俄期間，他用著世界語到各處考察，歸國後寫成的「年靑的蘇聯」，是有著「卽使精通俄語的年輕人，未必能觀察得如此精密」的批評的。</p>
<p>從「民衆藝術」運動起直到現在，他不離一步地跟著時代邁進。他親身體騐了現代日本文化運動上各個領域中的各個階段，他親手「蒔種」，親手扶植了日本的新興文化，他歷任國際文化研究所長，普羅科學研究所長，新興教育研究所長，世界語同盟中央委員長，反宗教同盟創立時的委員長，而且是卓絶的文學與戲曲作家，日俄文代恊會的指導者。我們要談日本現代文化運動，不能不提到他的名字。</p>
<p>但是他並不是和高爾基那樣地出身於勞動階級的作家，他是在五十年的生涯之中，經歷了苦惱的「自我鬥爭」，一重重苦鬥過來的革命的知識份子。也許因爲如此，倒使我們覺得更可愛，更有種親切之感。</p>
<p>最令我們感到興味的是，老大一把年紀，竟這樣熱烈地發憤鑽攻世界語，而說「我因世界語而得救」的事。對於自明治末頁以至大正初年日暮途窮了的日本資本主義社會的陰鬱的思想界的苦悶並無切膚體騐的我們，大槪是無從完全理解的。但是我們如果一想起有島武郎，芥川龍之介怎樣的以「死」來解决，武者小路實篤怎樣的墮落以求出路，對照起來，「我因世界語而得救」非但没有過火，不是最眞實不過的告白嗎？</p>
<p>最近東京文化界慶祝他五十歲紀念的集會上，他允許把日本知識階級二三十年來苦鬥過來的過程作爲題材，寫一部巨著。消息傳來，我們不禁衷心祝賀他的五十壽辰，並祝福他的健在！</p>
<h3 id="c202">文壇登龍術要 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>最近書舖子裏出版一本文壞登龍術，祗因想把一塊錢派作别的用處，至今尙無拜讀的幸運。好在登龍的文人倒瞧過不少，從他們那些行徑中，大可學點登龍方術，隨手記下幾條，借題目做文章，作文壇登龍術要；也許有些登龍有心，購術無錢的人，倒不妨看看。</p>
<p>一個無名作家要成名，得去和名家打交道。名家如理你，你就在自己文章中寫上「我的朋友」之類；如果不理，你就駡他，好在駡人用不到多大理由，例如藉貫，年齡，甚至是親戚關係，也一樣可成駡的資料，反正人家見你敢駡某人，就會注意。</p>
<p>寫作品得瞧别人歡喜，見人愛讀性史，你就專寫三角四角下體膨脹的戀愛小說，一定要把女人寫得十分猴急，會挑撥男子，這樣你的書包好銷，讀者不會表示倦意。</p>
<p>你還可以自己開書店辦雜誌，任便怎樣寫得狗屁不通肉麻當有趣，一樣可以堂皇出版。你還可請人代你譯成外國文，然後大吹大擂說自己作品是國際的了</p>
<p>有時機會凑巧，你也可以來一下轉變，做些暴動小說之類，不過要時時留心，如果略有風聲，就得趕緊寫供狀，作悔過書，表示已經無關。那時你就舉起什麽什麽的自造的旗子，表示立塲堅定</p>
<p>小也者，你可以專做包打探，說某某即某某化名，某某住在那兒，這樣，你也會出山。不單打探别人消息，也可以發表自己消息，和名人排在一起，甚至多登些照片。</p>
<p>凡此種種，不過其最主要者，得一於此，也便登龍有術，古人十載寒窗，爲的是飛黄騰達，今人削尖頭皮，都不過爭口飯吃。從前文人賣大字，今日文人賣小字，一樣都是賣，顧什麽面皮。袛有那些傻子，才會眞去做文，他的貢獻，堅執人生，窮探現實，結果祗落得死無下落，千萬不可師法！</p>
<h3 id="c203">茶話 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 吳秋山</p>
<p>喝茶是最Ｄemocracy的事，有閑者流，固然以茶爲禮物。爲消閒的良劑，就是一般平民，如村落裏的農夫樵子，和市　中的工人，也莫不如是。他們在薄寒的黄昏，或酷暑的晼晚，幾個友伴一道兒上茶社裏去，泡了壺茶，圍坐在簡陋的茶桌旁邊，隨意的啜着，隨便的談着，消掉了一天工作的勞　，雖然喝茶的方法各自不同，但對於茶所引起的佳趣是一樣的。</p>
<p>但喝茶是有許多講究的，而講究得最利害的怕要算是福建人了。記得以前在家的時候，齋居淸閑，窗明九凈，嘗以大如橘子的荆溪小壺，小似荔芰的雪白的茗深甌，成化宣德間的緣色皺痕的瓷碗，瓷盤，龍眼菰片或芒仔草骨編成的壺墊，和點銅錫罐，錯落的陳列在茶凡上，揀選武彝山岩單樣的名奇種，烘起紅窰風罅，取晒乾了的蔴草或炭心，　入罅裏燃燒，將盛滿了淸泉的玉絲鍋，放在爐上，水還浸有滾的時候，先把空壺滌凈，依下茶　，　　　以　水冲下，蓋去壺口的沐，再倒水於壺董上和小　裏，輪轉的洗了杯子之後，以茶注之，色如靺鞨，烟似輕嵐，芳冽的味兒，隠隠的沁入心脾，在微雨的窗前，同兩三呢友，徐徐共啜，並吃些蜜餞，和輕淡的茶食，眞是陶情愜意，什麽　氛俗慮，都付諸九霄雲外了。但近十餘年來，　泊在他鄉，雖然對於茶還是日夕匪誃的喝着，但爲了業務的忙碌，事實上缺少從容玩味的機會，祗好不管她是好是列，隨隨便便的冲着飲着罷了，回憶起往日的淸福，不禁有點憮然了。</p>
<p>前月游西湖，帶回了幾斤翁家村的野茶，味兒比普通的龍井甘冽，嘗於晨昏閑暇之時，取少許，加壧朶黛黛花，放入白瓷蓋甌，或玻璃盃中，冲滿開水，置於桌上，看着捲曲的綠葉，蓴絲也似的在水杯裏浮沉招展，令人感到一片冰心，溽暑全消，覺得比吃那些Ｉce　Whafer勝過多多，因作「茶話」以告世之有同好者。</p>

<h3 id="c204">平凡的事㈩㈠ <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>『你和我爭論也是無用的，這時候。反正事到臨頭，總有個自然的解决。嘴裏硬，是不濟事的。』</p>
<p>佩萸也只好這樣收束了，然而却仍然不免說了這樣的兩句：</p>
<p>『若是之光的家眷没有回杭州，那末，他就不會到閘北去了。』</p>
<p>『他不到閘北去，廠裏的事就了得好些嗎？』伯唐說。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>之光也和伯唐一樣，同是法國畢業的營造工程師；不過之光當初是利用勤工儉學的機會去的，在未入專門學校之前，在法國很度了幾年的工廠生活，後來遇了機會，才漸漸有了精神和物質的能力，進了巴黎一所工業大學去學營造工程師，恰巧遇着伯唐同班，因此就有了交誼。以性情而議，伯唐是個豪爽正直而又愛美的富家子弟，之光是一個嚴肅精密很識大體的鄉下書生，以實趣而論，伯唐在營造學上所注的專長是裝飾的藝術，之光在營造學上所注的專長是構造的計畫：當然，這兩種原因就可以呌我們明瞭他們兩人的個性了，可是他們同校數年的切磋琢磨的益處，却呌他們結成了莫逆之交。回國之後，伯唐在新京市政府做了一年的技術官，而之光却在上海一家營造公司做事，後來伯唐覺得宦海升沈是隨風無定的，剛好又値燕爾新婚，那位新夫人佩萸女士很不以新京的起居飲食爲然，於是伯唐就辭了官，擁了佩萸，回咥上海故居來度温馨的生活。過了大半年，伯唐又到了靜極思動的境界了，他看見上上海的營造事業一天發展一天，就把祖產提了一部分出來，組織了這個長興營造廠，並且邀了之光加入長興，托他擔任工程總管的職務。</p>
<p>三四年來，長興的生意，在上海已經是數一數二的了。固然，一則是伯唐倚賴自己的家世因而手腕很長，二則是他們兩個的技術確實是出人頭地；而長興的根本制勝，令人莫及之點，却是伯唐的知人善任和之光的管理有方，之光一方面用合理制度用人，另一方面却用合作制度待人，所以工作的效力固然能彀高，而勞資的感情也一樣能彀好。「一二八」的抗敵事情發生了，長興當然隨着全市的趨勢停止了工作。三五天之後，廠裏的工人，漸漸也隨全市的熱心男兒的趨勢，有些去投十九軍了，他們各自貢獻各自的技能，受了軍官們的指揮，帮着那些士兵做了些應急的防禦工作；之光也盡了個人力量之所能，給了他們許多便利。</p>
<p>在這樣的大敵當前，這些赤條條來去無牽掛的好漢子眞是奮不顧身的，尤其是遇見了一羣異言異服的人在異樣的國旗之下侵入我們領土。他們不僅忘記了甚麽是錢財，不僅忘記了甚麽是家族，並且連他們自己僅有的孑然一身，也一律交給他們口裏的那個「我們」，去抵抗他們口裏的那個「他們」！</p>
<p>然而這個「我們」之抵抗那個「他們」，看來漸漸明白不是一天兩天可以解决的，於是這些從市裏投到前線去告奮勇的好漢子，就覺得單是把自己一身交給這個「我們」究竟還不能持久，所以就進一步對着那些素來和自己接近的人去求援。他們的求援範圍固然認明了「素來和自己接近的」幾個字，可是他們却想不到人類之互相接近的來由種種不同，因此他們更顧慮不到那些被他們求援者的意識了。譬如長興營造廠的工人之求援於伯唐就是一個顯明的例。</p>
<p>這一天天色剛明的六點鐘光景，之光就按照昨天夜晚和伯唐約好的辦法起身先到廠裏去。他騎上那部雙輪機器自行車，從菜市路附近的庽所，卜司豋豋卡司豋豋地繞道走十多分鐘，越過了法租界沿江南面那道表示神經過敏故事張皇的鐵刺棚欄門，才到了大南門的附近。大南門附近一帶的早市，仍舊是像往常一樣忙碌的。雖然街上添了許多粉紅領章的憲兵，可是那些白色領章的警士，却彷彿因爲有了憲兵，就也模仿憲兵對於市民的那種嚴肅而又温和的態度。所以之光這一向每逢出了法租界南端的任何那一道鐵刺棚欄門，彷彿只看見警士檢查漢奸，却没有看見他們强奪黄包車的墊子。本來這一向在上海的任何街道上，倘若有甚麽不關國界的小糾紛發生，只須有人說一句「都是自家人」，那末這糾紛就立刻自行解决。</p>

<h3 id="c258">檇李佳話 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨猶有西施爪甲香丨</p>
<p>夏令，眞是水果世界；水果攤上的種標簽，和舞臺門前懸掛的名角牌子一般。檇李，是應時的佳果，所以水果攤上的「嘉興檇李」四個字，尤其寫得筆酣墨飽，窬易映入過往人們的眼簾。</p>
<p>「猶有西施爪甲香，」這是昔人詠凈相寺檇李的名句。檇李雖是嘉興的土產，但以凈相寺的出品爲第一。凈相寺檇李有一特别標記，便是西施的一搯爪㾗，粗細短長不一，宛比唐代開通錢有寳后爪㾗在背幕一般。中國人宗拜美人，總有多少流傳的神話；有人說是西施爪，誰都信以爲然，一輩文人學士，尤其當做唯一無二的好材料。但着，朱竹垞先生鴛湖棹歌云：『聞說西施曾一搯，至今顆顆爪㾗添。』掛着西施的牌子，益發增添着凈相寺檇李的價値。</p>
<p>檇李的佳種，旣在僧寺之中，官吏誅求，幾無寗歲。曾有官吏預將產李的庭院，悉用朱印斜封；以爲這麽一下子，所有果實，都屬官有了。待到檇李成實的時候，啟封摘果，枝頭早已一顆不存；只爲檇李名貴，結實以後，須得逐日灌漑；又須設法驅逐羣鳥，否則食盡乃止。俗吏不察其故，只道寺僧私採，立時撳倒光頭，大打其「一二三四」的屁股．圭僧負寃，幾欲盡伐其樹，以絶禍根。朱竹垞先生檇李賦序云：「近苦官吏需索，寺僧多伐去之，將來慮無存矣。」便是說明這麽一回事。</p>
<p>又有關於檇李的一椿俗吏笑話：前淸時，浙江霉雨成災，和現在「水哉水哉」的時代正差不多。有一位巡撫向屬吏說道：『今年災黎很苦』。嘉興令上前道：『回大人話，卑縣災黎不苦』。巡撫笑道：『旣稱災黎；那有不苦之理？』縣令返署　後，便覓很凈相寺檇李兩簍，上院貢獻道：「大人請嘗試之，卑縣檇李，實在不苦。」巡撫大笑，知道他誤聽災黎爲檇李。未幾，便把他參革功名，可憐誤聽災黎的縣令，從此便變爲災官了。</p>
<h3 id="c259">鬼話 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>說起鬼話，自然是我們中國最發達了。新鬼大，故鬼小，中國自從盤古三皇，以迄於中華民國二十二年，年深月久，大鬼小鬼，究竟有幾萬萬，非向高坐堂皇於森羅寳殿上的閻羅大王調查，是誰都無法知道的。</p>
<p>中國的鬼話，請幾位博士，碩士，學士，編成一部書，區區四庫全書，斷難專美。即如民間所傳說的陰曹地府，就是編大英百科全書的那些外國翰林院編修，也將自愧不學無術。在廣大無垠的陰曹地府間，有孟婆亭，惡狗村，奈何橋，血河池，尖刀山，迷魂陣，望鄉臺，風火井，十八層地獄，六道輪廻等大去處，雖然北極探險團，喜馬拉雅探險隊，以及發現新大陸的哥崙布大哥，都末有大駕光臨過，但我大唐貞觀皇帝，是曾經到此一游過的。諸君不信，西游記爲證。</p>
<p>至於鬼的種類，和陽世民族的複雜情形，也不相上下。大頭鬼，小頭鬼，吊</p>
<p>死鬼，摸壁鬼，餓死鬼，落水鬼，火燒鬼，癆病鬼等形形式式，一應俱全。此外如往往鬼哭，天陰則聞的戰塲鬼，長</p>
<p>安大宅中的勢利鬼等，更是不勝枚舉。讀者不信，請瞧中元節的盂蘭會。</p>
<p>這些，那些，都是眞憑實據。若說是迷信，眞是罪過，死了要進拔舌地獄，阿鼻地獄的。請瞧，智利國議院裏，前月也給二千火燒鬼吵得議員們毛髮悚然，一個個不安於位。可知人死爲鬼·是顚撲不破的。</p>
<p>本來這世界上，已充滿着賭鬼，色鬼，烟鬼，窮鬼，貪財鬼，勢利鬼。陽間地獄，已是人少鬼多，地府陰曹，更可不言而喻。</p>
<p>靑天白日，朗朗乾坤，人話不說說鬼話，倒也别有風味。</p>

<p>▲小睡</p>
<p>小睡能收些許凉，欹斜籐椅屋中央。當門片綠如人靜，沸地驕陽及午狂。能寂差應忘「可欲」，居安所貴是「知亡」。平生見事終堪信，要掣風雷做一塲！</p>
<p>▲沙遜房子樓望有作</p>
<p>燈火千街夜未闌，十三層上獨憑欄。羣居窗似蜂窠密，俯視樓疑鳥道盤。幾竭吾邦宜有是，竟污此土豈無端？千夫汗血銷磨地，可許渠</p>
<p>儂一息安？</p>
<h3 id="c261">鳴蛙 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>趙師秀有兩句詩，說是『黄梅時節家家雨，靑草池塘處處蛙，』這差不多早已膾炙人口了。眼前正是『家家雨』的時節，普天之下，當然也就不免是『處處蛙』了，</p>
<p>本來，蛙是兩棲勳物，一年四季，隨時隨地都可見其蹤跡；原不足奇。不過，當此梅雨時期，正是他們繁殖最盛，勢力最澎脹的季節罷了。這裏『閣·閣！閣！』那裏『閣！閣！閣！』到處可以聽到一片蛙聲，誰能說眼前不是『鳴蛙的世界』？</p>
<p>蘇東坡說：『畫梁初著燕，廢沼已鳴蛙。』賈島說：『雨後逢行鷺，更深聽遠蛙。』這都是對於鳴蛙輕描淡寫的話，不置可否，不贊一詞。</p>
<p>將一羣鳴蛙比擬成人，寓有深意的舊詩，要算陸游留下的幾句，爲起始突破前人的紀錄了。陸游說：『多情幽草沿墻綠；無賴羣蛙繞舍鳴。』又謂『心如老馬雖知路，』身似鳴蛙不屬官。』這話裏有話；絃外之音，得耐人尋味了！一褒一貶，前後彷彿互相矛盾！其實推測詩人的本旨，恐怕還是對於羣蛙同情的成分佔得較多。因爲所謂『無賴』，只能作『無聊』解，和我們現在駡人『無賴』的意義有出入．說那羣線舍的鳴蛙，發出無聊的呻吟，當然可是一種完全責備的口吻。至於後來說到『身似鳴蛙不屬官』，那更不僅是與蛙有同情之感，且直接將已身比成鳴蛙一般了。</p>
<p>置身在象牙之塔朱門金屋中的人，是不會對鳴蛙有若何好感的；然而不管你有無好感，只要逢到梅雨時期，他們便出來呐喊成一片，算是不甘沉悶而鼓噪；千古以來，這早經是『鐵一般的事實』</p>

<p>門上，貼着一張褪了色的紅紙，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「專接來往客商。」「宿金每夜一角。」没有侍者，没有電梯，跨進去就可瞧見那連在一起的雙疊木床，硬挺的楊松板上，舖着蓆子，（指夏天）一條破被，死蛇一樣地捲在一邊；牆上塗滿了臭蟲血，夾雜着幾個給香烟頭熏焦的黄點，有幾處還寫着發洩牢騷的句子。</p>

<p>奈何奈何···莫笑吾窮···莫白吾眼···飽　　你老拳···勢利的狗賊啊·····</p>
<p>地板上，吐滿着濃厚的痰，黏住了幾個半死半活的臭蟲，咳嗽聲像連珠砲似的發着，嘆息聲和鼻鼾聲混成一片。</p>

<p>— 黄覺民</p>
<p>㈥此外另設飛機塲以供參觀者臨空遊覽。每二十英里取費三元。余以一生未曾乘坐飛機引爲憾事，乃一試之。覺每小時百二十英里之速度，觀時甚速，坐時似甚慢也。六月十三日在續臣總統船上接無線電報稱該機之一架於十二日失事。乘客八人五男三女，及駕駛正副機師二人，均被焚畢命。予若應友之約，同乘胡佛總統船六月十六日首途返國，則十二日適計劃在博覽會遊覽，或亦遭難，今旣得免於禍亦云</p>
<p>幸矣。</p>
<p>㈦長途電話此亦不設交通陳列所内，可通美國全國四十八大城，觀者得免費一試。余爲好奇心所驅使，等候兩點鐘始獲輪流試打，自芝加哥至紐約市長途電話，冀達紐約城西二十四街四百三十號陳紀彝同學，不意陳君時適外出竟不得達。幸蒙司機者准予另行一試，果得與哥侖比亞大學列濱斯湯寄宿舍金樹榮君作三分鐘談話，金君所說余均聽得十分淸楚，與在紐約打電無異。但余所說則金君多聽模糊，以致三分鐘時間，僅能請金君爲我代轉哥大師範院中國教育學會諸友，說我在芝加哥世界博覽會用免費長途電話，向彼等請安而已。</p>
<p>㈣·社會科學陳列所</p>
<p>至此觀者可見五千年前人類穴居野處生活，美國人最初家庭狀况。自油燈以至電光無線電汽車氷箱家庭用具，無不畢列，以見家庭生活之進步。其他社會問題如資本之集合及分配，移民之經過，教育之發展，最新式之住屋及將來又將如何改良，並模範之鄉村及或用圖表或用模型陳列表明之。</p>
<p>此所陳列集中注意於美國人家庭生活。第一層入門觀者卽見美國人殖民時代之家庭生活。紡織縫紉採薪取火等，無不以手爲之。再進則一旁陳列美國人鄉村生活如禮拜堂學校馬車隣舍等等。一旁則可見一九三三年城市中可住數十百家之巨厦。而城市之生活亦與鄉村大不相同。如工廠學校公園遊戲塲娛樂所花徑汽車火車無線電飛機等等，皆畢備供人享受矣。</p>
<p>再進則見由歐洲運來陳列之五萬年前古穴之一部。與美洲土人在伊利諾省中部所築之穴略爲相似。</p>
<p>再次則見活動電影。指示各國移民來美人口驟增，因而交通住屋學校犯罪種族衛生各問題，相繼而起，及政府如何解决之法，使知人民納稅維持政府費用，所得實若干倍之。</p>
<p>在所之外而屬於社會科學組者，尙有千年前馬耶maya古廟之模型。美國土人之村落，及我國熱河喇嘛殿。（圖二）</p>

<p>田靑笑道：你是想媳婦想大發了吧？爲什麽生氣？趙自强搖着頭道：不是說笑話，我若有一點辦法，我不拿槍桿了。這回聽說總司令要來檢閱了，各營拚命的補充起來。我這連補充了二十名弟兄，他媽的，没有一個不是鐵屎。别的不說，教了他們兩個禮拜，連箕斗册子，全鬧不上來。（註：兵士之三代履歷，軍營術語曰箕斗册子，亦曰花名册子。）田靑笑道：我那連稍微好一點，可是也有一兩個飯桶。你别性急，慢慢的教他們得了。趙自强道：我還没有耐性啦。我是聽你說了，别打他們，打他們最教他們喪廉恥，可是···他說到這裏，正好有兩名新兵由窗户外經過，舉手行着禮。趙自强道：進來，我問你們話。兩個兵士，走到門口站定。前面一位，是大個兒，大黑的臉，倒配上一雙白果眼。趙自强道：你最不行了。你别慌，慢慢的背一背你的箕斗册子。咱們只當是平常說話，你别謊。你姓什麽呌什麽？他道：我呌大個兒李。田靑站在後面，忍不住噗嗤一聲笑了。趙自强回頭向田靑皺了眉道：你聽聽，若是總司令檢閱的時候，抽查到了他，我怎麽辦？那大個兒了，挺着身子，翻了白眼，作聲不得。趙自强咳了一聲道：你在外面拉洋車的時候，呌大個兒李，當了兵還呌大個兒李嗎？這兩個禮拜，排長班長對木頭說的話嗎？大個兒李道：排你呌什麽？他道：俺呌李長發啦。田靑忍不住挿嘴道：别帶那個啦字。趙自强點頭道：凑付着罷。你保人是誰？他道：保人是張三德。趙自强道：你那裏人？「俺山東濟南府。」「多大歲數」？「二十九歲」。「祖父是誰」？（一二九）</p>

<h3 id="c265">談娛樂 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>前幾天偶然聽着一個窮朋友說，他想賣掉一部文稿，買一架留聲機。當時我具有一點奇怪，我想賣了自己的心血而去買極不重要的娛樂品，這不是活見鬼了麽？難道聽Ｘ博士的「覇王别姬」或是「蘇三起解」比吃飯還要重要麽？我的窮朋友尙且如此，那末不必靠賣文稿而仍有飯吃的仁兄，當然更不肯忽視娛樂在人生中的眞義了。</p>
<p>果然，關於娛樂，近年來提高了地位不少，據說娛樂不僅是足以喜笑顏開，心花怒放，而且還可以救國。於此可知，娛樂者實足以與「經懺」等先後媲美。不過中國到底是宿病太深，雖然有如此奇妙的救國良方，仍不免給叛黨叛國的忠實同志建立了「僞國」而且聽說「華東共和國」亦在醖釀之中，這樣看來，有負娛樂救國論者的孤心苦詣，殊堪浩歎。</p>
<p>然而認娛樂有救國之奇效者，厥爲深知娛樂之眞理的聰明人、他們生平對於斯道極有研究。就拿跳舞來說，他們懂得那一個跳舞塲最爲華麗。什麽地方適宜開跳舞塲救國游藝會，什麽地方適宜電影皇后加冕典禮，他們完全了然於胸。至於那一齣是梅蘭芳的拿手好戲，那一位明星是一九三三年的好萊鳱皇后，那一個是今年的花國總統（大槪爲了適應時勢起見也改爲主席了吧。）自然都是如數家珍，無所不知，無所不曉。</p>
<p>很明顯的，娛樂云者，只限於花花公子或老爺太太大小姐之流，因爲只有這般皎皎者焉纔有充分娛樂之可能，她們有金錢還有時間，他們有精神還有興緻。他們非娛樂不足以興奮，她們非娛樂不足以生活。他們深懂得此中三昧，他們覺得在救國救民的民生主義中還要加上一條娛樂之必要。。總之，現在的娛</p>
<p>樂完全是爲了這一羣高等華人而風行，只要看大光明門前擠滿了百元一套的西裝和一九三三式的旗袍，便可證明這一羣對於娛樂之迫切。至於白天勞苦終日到晚來又不能拿出兩毛小洋去看羅克開快車的朋友，却只有趿着草拖鞋搖着蒲扇，羣立在洋貨店前聽着「唏唏」「笑笑」們的無線電播音的十教歌了。除了如此　　這般之外，他們還有娛樂之機會麽？</p>
<p>關於這個題目，似乎還可以做好些文章，但是今天却得就此打住了。</p>

<p>『老張！算了，陳天再來好吧！』阿雲被擁擠得連氣都透不出來，而前面仍是堆滿層層密密的人羣；他恢心了，掙着氣對擠在他前面的同伴說。在他的油膩膩的額角上淋着汗珠。</p>

<p>老張經了這樣一說，愈形地夾緊腰身擠前去。像衝鋒陷陣般。</p>
<p>『喂！買一張！』</p>
<p>『喂！票子，一塊錢！』</p>
<p>老張已逐漸擠近去。舉起隻手伸向前去，在他的手掌上有着一塊錢。他開始呌喊起來。</p>
<p>阿雲同老鄭，跟在人門的背後擁上去。在他們前面的人已漸漸减少。終於，接到了老張遞過來的票子，被捲進去。</p>
<p>『唉！禮拜天的人這樣多！』老張一看到他們都進來，微笑着對他們說。</p>
<p>『眞是天曉得，鈔票擠兌也没有這個樣子！』阿雲一邊揩汗，一邊哼着氣說。</p>
<p>『不管它，快點換衣裳去好！』老鄭恨恨地說。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>鄙人前以「人生在世，究竟爲的什麽」一問題，函請</p>
<p>賜教．昨閱申報附刊店員通訊欄，見原函曁解答一併登出，甚爲欣慰！答辭言簡意賅，非洞明現社會底藴者，烏克臻此？而於「生」字涵義，分層說明，勘透入微，尤見獨到處。惟本問題前經葉韋兩君解答，「人生在世，歸根究底，爲的是喫飯。」鄙人以爲喫飯是延續生存的手段之一，而非人生之目的。茲復經</p>
<p>先生解答，「人生在世，爲的就是一個『生』字」。是以生存解釋生存，似有未竟之處。須知鄙人之發此問，蓋欲追求人生之終極。因爲人之生也，生的條件，已經具備，此後只須繼續維持其生存便得，維持生存，爲人生之權利，爲延續生命必不可缺之主要條件。至於人生之精義，當别有所在。鄙人天資愚鈍，終夜彷徨，思維再四。始略有端倪。茲爲揭　如下；極願盡最指導，俾本問題之完全答案，得以公佈於世。</p>
<p>人生爲奮鬥之歷程，人類之斷續奮鬥，送造成一部社會進化史。使無人類之奮鬥，則人類早爲洪水猛獸所吞没，更安有今日之社會？則今日而猶穴居野處，茹毛飲血可也。從古代聖王之創作，以迄近代科學家之發明，均足代表社會最勇敢之鬥士。其所遺留吾人之功蹟，至爲偉大！然吾凡民雖於社會未能發明驚人之技術，要非於社會毫無供獻，毫無裨益：彼先知先覺，創始於前，必賴後知後覺，執行於後。承前起後，爲吾輩一般平凡者之責任，而莫可推卸。上自聖王賢相哲人碩士，下逮農工商學，販夫走卒，其畢生所經營，日夕不遑；胥爲創造社會，推進文明，作殊死力之長期奮鬥。此種奮鬥精神，由民族之蕃衍，傳之千秋萬世而莫或能替。易云：「自疆不息」，今云：「努力奮鬥」，名雖不同，要皆人類類生俱來之根本動向，不因國殊，不因時異．父以是傳之子，子以是傳之孫，遂造成今日莊嚴燦爛之宇宙大觀，炳炳麟麟之人類紀錄。鄙人是以曰：「人生爲奮鬥之歷程」；「人生在世，究竟爲的奮鬥」，「奮鬥爲人類與生俱來之根本動向，因是以有今日之社會，今日之文明」。一得之愚，敢以質諸</p>
<p>先生，倘荷進而教之，則更幸矣。謹此函達，並頌</p>
<p>教祺劉杏川鞠躬</p>
<p>編者按：奮鬥是一種手叚，並不是一種目的。無目的，就無奮鬥。見人更殺，逢人便打，還有什麽意義呢？必也有了目的，然後向着阻撓我達到目的的人物，極力進攻，才有成功，才有意義。這世界從來是一個物竸的世界，非但人類，其他一切動物植物，都無不天天在競爭和奮鬥的過程中。不過他們奮鬥的目的是什麽呢？這問題，有好多人，每每會說不出來。我們只須考察他們奮鬥的結果，就不難明白。「適者生存」，這是奮鬥的結果。因此我們可以很明瞭的看出，奮鬥的目的，或者可以說人生的目的，就是「生存」。</p>
<p>要生存的第一條件，就是吃飯。所以七月七日劉君來信，介紹葉韋兩君的意見，說「人生在世，歸根究底，爲的是吃飯。」這話當然可以說是「一語破的」。不過「吃飯」這兩個字，很有出入；在没有飯吃的時候，祗求有飯吃；等到有了飯吃，不免還要想吃好飯或安逸飯。所以假使以「吃飯」爲人生唯一目的，那末爲著這種「無有底止」的慾望所驅使，就要造成殘酷的你搶我奪的恐怖世界了。</p>
<p>所以我們以爲在有了飯吃以後，在能夠生存以後，就要以「什樣生得有意義」爲目的；不該再去掠奪他人生活必需的資料，來供我一已的享樂。我們所謂「生得有意義」，並不指以前許多陳死人所謂的「建功立業」「功埀不朽」「榮宗耀祖」以及「封妻蔭子」等一類的唯心論。我們提倡的是互助。没有飯吃的人有求人帮助的權利；富裕的人，就有帮助别人的義務。</p>

<h3 id="c271">“Ｍmmmmmm”？ <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 引西</p>
<p>這是好萊塢的新名詞</p>
<p>時代女性們的新趨尙</p>
<p>影迷們，你們知道不知道？好萊塢又發明了個新名詞了！這圙字就是“Ｍmmmmmm”。追字怎樣解釋呢？你倘使將七字（多少些亦不要緊）Ｍ，連貫起來，就可以體會出來了，我現在將這字，譯作「唔丨丨丨」。這個「唔」字，讀作Ｎ的鼻音，雖然Ｍ和Ｎ的音，一個唇閉，一個唇張，迥然不同，但你看見一個女性的身體，覺得贊賞得不可以字眼形容時，外國人</p>
<p>說聲“Ｍmmmmmm”中國人就說聲“Nnnnnnnn”這是極自然而然的感歎聲。現在我拿牠譯作「唔丨丨丨」，大槪還不至於失之千里吧。</p>
<p>這個「唔丨丨丨」到底是什麽呢？有人說就牠是“It”的變相，“It”多生些肉，就變爲“Ｍmmmmmmm”了。本來克萊拉寳是一位肌肉豐肥的“It　girl”可是現在她從歐洲回來，她的腰肢又加了一寸，而變成了一位現代話躍的Ｍmmmmmm　girl了。還有一位梅威斯脫女士，她現在是性感（Ｍ　Ｓes　appeal）的紅星，當然她對於這時代化的Ｍmmmmmm是抓得緊緊的了。所以我們可以說，女人體格的時髦，自從好事之徒，在克萊拉寳身上，找到了“It”之後，後來就有更加好事的人，將她來了一個普遍化，將她化爲Ｓ·Ａ·而使一般女子，誰都可以有（非但女子可以有，男子亦可以有Ｓ·Ａ·）；誰都可以操練出來，要是她缺少的話。現在好了，不知道又是那位好事之徒，惟恐天下無事，强將Ｓ·Ａ·的一種，特别的標榜出來，替牠起了一個新名字，呌做“Ｍmmmmmm”</p>
<p>女子身體的時髦，當然亦有時代性的。所以前幾年講究腰肢苗條的時候，許多明星們，惟恐身體胖起來。格麗妲妮蓀爲要使身體瘦些，所以有十八天的减食，硬將身體餓瘦了。現在Ｍmmmmmm出來了，女子們又講究什麽『豐右有餘，柔若無骨』起來了。所以從前自已挨餓，以求瘦損腰肢的格麗妲妮蓀，現在又備了許多糖果，隨時取食，以求其身體的日臻肥碩了。</p>
<p>有人說那末“Ｍmmmmmm”不就是健康美嗎？不是的。健康美端在肌肉堅實，血氣充足，而“Ｍmmmmmm”呢，却是另一種東西，牠是在健康之上，還要有動人的性感。當然這是很難分解的兩件東西，但是聰明人，也容易領會得她們的區别。我們倘使將康健美上加些性的誘惑，那就成了「唔」。</p>
<p>但是說了半天，作者不過告訴讀者們一些好萊塢的新趨尙，並不是勸告中國的女星們，亦要多吃肉，多吃糖果，多睡覺，使身體肥起來。老實說肥女而有曲線美及性感的，在好萊塢亦祇有梅威斯脫一個。况且梅威斯脫身體雖肥，但她却天天運動身體，不使她的體重再增加。許多女子看見梅威斯脫肥得有趣，亦想加肥些，恐怕没有得到肥的好處，反而體態臃腫，行動不便起來了。</p>

<h3 id="c272">評「夜市長」Ｔhe　Night　Mayor <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>近來片名忽然風行直譯起來，「鷹歌」如此，「白姊妹」如此···而國泰開映的「夜市長」也如此。至於這是否好現象，不在本文中提出討論，不過是附帶的說說而已。</p>
<p>好萊塢的製片家十分的顯出題材的恐慌，這是我們少許留心便可以觀察出來的。然而這决不是眞的没有了題材，而是他們不願意在眞實的社會事件中去找尋出路。所以他們最樂意在空虚的故事中來耗費金錢和時間，直接的又使有閒的觀衆們在幾小時中得着空虚的娛樂</p>
<p>「夜市長」的故事的虚構，這該是每一個看過本片的觀衆應有感覺。旣然如此，我們當不必在其中追尋眞實性。不過我總覺得這樣的故事未免無聊。</p>
<p>假如有人說本片的用意，主要是譏諷某種胡閙的官僚，固然我們在影片的開始以至市長偕舞女潛至旅館纏綿，都可自出那一貫的用意，但是到後來畢竟要使這一市長成爲正人君子，所以他居然理智的爲情敵證婚，甚至於在最後帶領市民肩着Ｗe　Want　Beer的牌子示威遊行，自然是表示作着對於羅斯福政策之擁護了。至於那個舞女居然肯犧牲市長夫人的地位而下嫁新聞記者，而說是爲了市長的政治前途，更是妙極。所以這决不是譏諷政治當局，而是奴役對於主人一番勸諫的苦心。然而這種說教的力量，又顯然是非常貧薄的了。</p>
<p>在演出方面說，也許有人認爲那種明快而佻達的作風較爲新奇。關於這一點；我們固然不必忽視這種作風對於劇情頗爲適合，但是在好些塲面故意緊張的誇張，却又不免令人懷疑每一影片應有的統一性的破壞。李屈山Ｌee　Tracy的動作固然明快，但有些塲合双顯出輕狂。至於美國的堂皇官吏是否如此放蕩不覊，乃是我中國人難於理解的了。</p>
<p>然而導演的小市民的不平氣分，乃是在這一作品中多少表示出來了的，他在前半部對於官吏的兕駡，的確是刻苦描畫。市長貪睡不接電話，市長的爲政祇是爲銅像揭幕，爲球塲發球，爲賽拳致詞，最後的爲情人證婚，以及到跳舞班勾搭少女。至於爲了一個女人而使情敵下獄，時而放縱，時而抱捕一任己之所欲，并且還說到市長秘書居然無辜殺人，這種描寫，眞是刻毒之至。於此，中國的觀衆返身回顧，不知作何感想。</p>

<p>丨上海大戲院映丨</p>
<p>誰說白俄没有祖國保護？他們的祖國就是全世界的資本主義國家。這次兩張拉斯蒲丁，據說審查結果并無：辱俄皇所在，但終於因爲白俄反對，而僅在華界的上海大戲院，公映了德國出品的一張。</p>
<p>故事是俄國的一個傳說，用不到在這裏重述。但是在這故事中造訴我們是很多的，</p>
<p>我們知道從神權時代轉變到君權時代（這自然不是階段論者，那末機械的不法，同時神權君權，有時是互相結合的。）是經過一番鬭爭的。拉斯蒲丁是一個神怪的代表者，而帝后雖則以國母之尊，但以愛子經過他的醫治，非常相信他，尊敬他。這說明着老一輩的人是何等尊重神權，也就是說明着君權的不能不在神權之前低頭。但小一輩的就不是這樣了他要反抗，他要打倒這所謂神俄皇儲子，雖則自己的病是拉斯蒲丁治愈而處心積慮的想謀死他終於在毒餅無效之後繼之，以五個槍彈而置拉氏於死地。這不是極明顯的說明君權戰勝神權了嗎</p>
<p>其次這張影片之對於「神」（拉斯蒲丁），是站在敵對的態度上製作的。所以不但終於把拉斯蒲丁的死映出，同時更把拉斯蒲丁的荒淫，暴露得痛痛快快。甚至他晤舊情人露莎也會遭到女父的痛擊受傷路地。</p>
<p>我不知别一個衆觀，或則批評者，對於這張拉斯蒲丁是怎樣的理解着。但我是始終以爲不是如此解釋是不能把握到拉斯蒲丁的中心意識的。因爲這不但是影片的意識，同是也是這一個傳說的意識。</p>
<p>至於技術，德國片的作風，素來和好萊塢是不相同的。他没有好萊塢的富於現代性，所以他們很高興表現古代故事的影片。「龍翔鳳舞」是這樣！「白魔」是這樣；這張「拉斯蒲丁」是和上述影片同樣作風的作品。他常常具着非常長的鏡頭。極酣暢的表現某一點：而不同於美國片鏡頭的變換得快，使得眼花撩亂。至於聲的運用。又是德國自的特長。導演者極力注意聲與影的恊調，使觀到得到耳目的享受。演員方面自然以康拉維德爲最。他非常老靠，同時也非常深刻的表現出劇中人應有的動作，甚至感情。他人也都稱職。</p>

<p>— 時春</p>
<p>被稱爲美國嘉寳的凱絲玲海嬪，雖然在好萊塢祗有演過二張片子，一張「棄夫」及一張「奢望」Ｔho　Great　Desier，然而她的聲名，却蓋過了在好萊塢一般老資格的明星。</p>
<p>凱絲玲旣爲羣衆所注意，於是對於她的出身家况以及怎樣入藝術界的經過，也曾有許多新聞記者費了許多的光陰向凱絲玲詢問。但是美國嘉寳非但面貌，和瑞典嘉寳酷肖，其性格亦復相似。她對於家况出身等問題，諱莫和深，始終不向人吐露眞實情形。於是謠言紛起。有的說凱絲玲生過幾個孩子，都在家中，别的人說她已經結過婚但是没有小孩。又有人說她在勃林茂大學得過學位的，别的又說她没有進過大學。還有人說她有一千六百萬的財產，但别的又說她没有產業，祗靠了她的薪水生活。議</p>
<p>論紛紜，究不知誰的話屬實。</p>
<p>後來終究有人探聽到了她的一切。原來凱絲玲是美國東部哈德福人。她的父親是蘇麥氏海濱博士，他雖然名望很高，然而並没有產業·她一共兄弟姊妹六人，死了一個，現在共五人·她是第三個。她的確進過大學，學習的是戲劇，但没有畢業，她已嫁了三年，她的丈夫是個商人，但是没有生過孩子。</p>
<p>凱絲玲的秘密終於被大家知道了·這裏我們也可以佩服好萊塢的義務偵探</p>

<p>— 思瀛</p>
<p>喀爾康拉第拿了公主的信，跑到宰相室裏，將信呈交宰相。宰相將信拆開一看，覺得心花怒放。原來公主對於那邦德維獨羅親王的婚事，已經答應了。宰相向着喀爾道「恭喜恭喜，恭喜將軍！」他於是吩咐邦德維獨羅親王趕速啟程前來。宮裏亦籌備開跳舞會，歡迎邦德維獨羅親王。公主這時後悔亦來不及了，因爲宰相要挾着，說倘這次婚事半途中止；必定會引起兩國戰爭的。</p>
<p>跳舞會的日子到了。在廣大華麗的跳無廳上，宰相領着公主跑了進來，羣臣的眷屬們，花團錦簇地圍侍着。一回兒侍衛吹着號，宣布邦德維獨羅親王駕到了。親王是個少年病夫，神氣索然，好像墳墓裏爬起來的僵屍。公主似乎很不屑似的，將頭抬得更加高些，很不自在地伸出手來，給邦德維獨羅親王吻着。音樂開始了，彈的就是公主和喀爾在那晚初次見面時所彈的華爾慈舞調。公主憤然向那親王道「我們跳舞吧。」她實在再也忍不住了，因爲喀爾站在旁邊，，虎視眈眈地看住了公主，使她無地自容。但是親王是不跳舞的。他看見喀爾立在身旁，就招呼着他道「請你代表一下，我不會跳舞，可以不可以？」</p>
<p>「可以不可以？」喀爾話未說完，立卽將公主摟了過來，不等公主答應，就跳了起來。宰相一看事情不妙，立卽喝止，但是喀爾和公主已在人叢中擠了過去。宰相在人堆裏擠進擠出，尋找喀爾和公主。這時皇帝駕到了，宰相亦不知道，還是在追尋着公主和喀爾。等到有人拉住了他，告訴他后帝已經駕到，皇帝已經走了進來。公主連忙迎上去，她這回一定要見到皇帝了。后帝看見了公主了。他問她道：「你這位姊姊眞好，從學校裏回來了，亦不來看我一趟。公主拉着皇帝的小手，安慰他道「好弟弟，我屢次要見你，但是宰相總攔阻着，不許我見你。」皇帝盛氣向着宰相道：「好宰相，我不用你了，你給我回家去吧！」皇帝看了他的姊姊生得這麽美麗，就問她爲什麽没有人娶她呢？公主指着邦德維獨羅親王道「他要娶我。」邦德維獨羅親王覺得有些自慚形穢，他對皇帝說「我們的婚姻，是不能成功的。我的一心，已經專注於我們可愛的木乃伊了。」皇帝聽了笑道「好極了，你回來找你的木乃伊吧！」</p>
<p>公主將雙手搭顺皇帝的肩上，在皇帝的耳朶邊說了幾句話。皇帝就轉過身來，將手拍着喀爾的肩膀，向公主道「這個人怎樣？你願意嫁他嗎？我想他應當封爲親王。」</p>
<p>公主連忙接着道「好的，好的，你應當封他爲親王。」（完）</p>

<p>The world economic panic has become increasingly acute in recent years. Silver has retreated from being a precious metal to having the same status as a general commodity. It is no longer able to hold the measuring stick for measuring prices. It has been fluctuating in the world market, the same as the ups and downs of commodity prices. Our country uses silver. Although the tael has been abolished and replaced by the yuan, the currency system has not yet completed its unification. Therefore, in the past four years (from the beginning of the economic panic in 1929 to the present), it has been particularly severely affected by the decline in silver prices. Among them, the import trade of foreign goods has suffered the most. Since hearing the proposal to increase silver prices and stabilize the gold-silver price ratio, all have been happy and joyful, thinking that the hope of rejuvenating our country's import and export trade and reversing the economic decline will not be far away. And I fear that it is not necessarily so. Recently, the World Economic Conference has shelved political issues and is not talking about them. Even the stabilization of currency cannot but temporarily allow it to change naturally. Then, what can be discussed today is only this silver issue.</p>
<p>The price ratio between gold and silver was still stable from 1921 to 1929. In the last three years, it has fallen to more than 50%. The general conclusion is that the reason for this decline is due to the relationship between demand and supply, and that silver has been rejected as currency. For example, the United States' destruction of subsidiary silver coins and India's sale of Tibetan silver have resulted in an oversupply of silver. Silver is also a byproduct of other mining industries. As a result, the price of silver has fallen like a river. In fact, this trend had already been brewing before the outbreak of the world panic. In terms of the total amount of silver produced in the world, it was 7,704,000 kilograms in 1930, only 6,025,000 kilograms in 1931, and no more than 5,000,000 kilograms in 1932. The amount of annual reduction is not small. And the need for silver, such as in the interior of our country, has not only not decreased slightly, but is also longing to increase. Then, the argument that supply and demand are not corresponding lacks a strong justification. In fact, silver has also become a kind of commodity. General commodity prices have fallen below the standard, and silver has followed suit. Today, commodity prices are soaring, and silver is also rising at the same time. The reason for the sharp rise and fall is here. Since the theory of bimetallism arose, the United States has even advocated using silver as one of the currency reserves. However, the bimetallic system, based on historical experience, only gives advanced countries a bad impression. The result is the same as inferior currency driving out good currency. A single country is afraid that no one dares to try it at risk. Therefore, we can only seek international cooperation to operate this system of using both gold and silver. If this proposal can be made appropriately at the Economic Conference and can be implemented, silver will regain its status as a precious metal and establish a fixed price ratio with gold. Then, the price of silver will naturally increase. How the increase in the price of silver affects the reduction of the world currency parity, I will not discuss for the time being, but I will state my views on the impact on our country as follows.</p>
<p>From an optimistic point of view, the stabilization of silver prices means that our country's foreign trade will no longer be subject to unexpected constraints. There is also a certain standard for calculating imported goods. Especially in markets such as Shanghai and Hankou, which are centered on commerce, there is no need to feel the threat of different prices from morning to evening when settling with foreign currencies. The slightly lower prices of imported goods are also enough to allow general consumers to have room to maneuver. Then, the market will prosper and there is great hope. However, on the other hand, since the price of silver has been increased, the import of tangible trade will exceed what is unavoidable and will further increase. In addition to other trade, our country only has sporadic remittances from the hard work of overseas Chinese in its international balance of payments. Currently, overseas Chinese in various places are affected by the economic panic. This kind of intangible import will inevitably decrease. As a result, domestic cash will continue to flow overseas due to the high price of silver. Even a few large cities with concentrated cash will have the risk of rising currency values. Then, general commodity prices will inevitably decrease relatively. In our country's young industry, it is not only squeezed by foreign products, but also threatened by falling prices. Development cannot be expected. Maintaining the status quo is also not easy. As for the general public and the countryside, they have already suffered from the lack of hard currency and the chaos of the currency system during the period of low silver prices. Once the price of silver increases, cash will become more concentrated, and the trend of currency contraction will become more serious. Therefore, no matter whether they are industrial workers, laborers, handicraft workers, or farmers, their income, measured in currency values, will inevitably decrease. If so, the consumption capacity of the general society will inevitably decline. The misfortune of the economic panic suffered by various countries in the past is likely to reappear in our country. Based on this, the result of increasing the price of silver is that the world hopes that it can make up for the deficiency of cash bias, but in China, it will inevitably fall into a more tragic situation.</p>

<p>Japan's Warship Construction Costs Over 500 Million</p>
<p>(Washington) US Navy Secretary Swanson stated today that the naval bases at Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal will be the first to be transformed into the world's most modern naval bases. He has requested the President to allocate funds from the unemployment relief fund as soon as possible, as these two locations are the most important military locations, and their outdated equipment and weak defenses have been criticized by all parties for a long time. This renovation work will use a large portion of the funds to renovate air bases, and the renovation of these two naval bases will be carried out simultaneously with the renovation of the battle fleet.

<p>(Tokyo) In view of the United States' major overhaul of maritime defenses, the Japanese Navy Department is eager to compete and has recently formulated a second warship construction plan, which includes: (1) two 8,500-ton light cruisers, costing 61,200,000 yen; (2) two aircraft carriers, each of 10,000 tons, costing 84,000,000 yen; (3) fourteen 1,400-ton destroyers, costing 94,080,000 yen; (4) six submarines, totaling 7,500 tons, costing 40,500,000 yen; (5) one 5,000-ton mine-laying ship, costing 12,000,000 yen; (6) torpedo boats and other military boats, costing 50,000,000 yen; (7) eight squadrons of aircraft, costing 160,000,000 yen. The total cost of the above seven items is 501,780,000 yen. Among them, two cruisers and six destroyers cannot be built before the end of 1936 according to the London Treaty, but the Navy Department plans to complete this plan before 1936 and will request 120,000,000 yen in the next fiscal year to cover the construction costs.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Ambassador Debuchi in the United States to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, world telegraph news on the 10th prominently featured the statement of US Navy Secretary Swanson, and other newspapers also advocated a great navalism. Competition in warship construction among countries is inevitable in the future. The report stated that the content of Swanson's statement is as follows: "Today, countries refuse to cooperate with the US government in reducing armaments. Future world peace can only be ensured by the balance of military power among countries. Therefore, the US Navy will expand its naval armaments to the maximum extent based on its treaty rights to complete national defense." (Japan United Press Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Democratic Senators Shearman and Maxon proposed on the 12th to the US President to establish a large air force. Their proposal stated that 120 million yuan should be used to strengthen national defense and build 900 army aircraft from the 3.3 billion yuan budget calculated in the National Industrial Recovery Act. Then the US Army's air force construction plan of 1,800 aircraft in 1926 can be completed. It is reported that the President is currently considering this proposal.

<p>(Tokyo) The Kanto air defense exercise is imminent in two weeks. The Ministry of the Army is carrying out preparatory research centered on senior adjutants of the Korean Peninsula. Yesterday, the following instructions were issued within the ministry: During the exercise, all members of the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army will be on night duty to study light control. On August 9th, hypothetical bombs and incendiary bombs will be dropped to train evacuation methods. Large smoke tubes will be used, one hundred of them will be fired in the Miyakezaka area to deploy smoke screens, and a defense exercise against enemy aircraft attacks will be held. In addition, the Tokyo Railway Bureau has scheduled the afternoon of the 14th to discuss light control with private railway companies in the suburbs. During the large-scale exercise, the signal lights of each station and the lights of the trains will be turned off, and they will run in the dark, holding an unprecedented exercise.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Home Affairs is considering air defense facilities as particularly important when constructing urban plans and is conducting investigations. Recently, as a result of consultations with the military authorities, a plan has been formed, which is about to make important revisions to the construction plans of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and major cities in the Kyushu region. Each city is divided into several districts, and each district is equipped with shelters, nursing stations, food distribution stations, and emergency activity headquarters as safe zones in the event of an air raid by enemy air forces. In addition to these passive air defense facilities, aircraft interception equipment will also be installed on the roofs of large buildings and in parks. (Japan United Press Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Army Strength Over 960,000</p>
<p>Navy on Par with US, Britain, and Japan</p>
<p>(Paris) The French newspaper "L'Humanité" has recently made further discoveries regarding France's armaments. It claims that its disclosures are supported by government documents. According to the newspaper, the actual strength of the French army is now 961,000 men, while the number published by the League of Nations is only 696,000 men. "L'Humanité" further claims that France spends 6 billion francs more annually on expanding its armaments than its national budget admits, or about 75 million pounds sterling at the current exchange rate, as the military expenditure in the French national budget is only 11 billion francs. "L'Humanité" further claims that France's military preparedness today is beyond the expectations of ordinary people, and that all other talk of disarmament is merely for external consumption. The attitude of "L'Humanité" towards the French army's armaments is such, and it is a very coincidental matter, that the speech made by French Naval Minister Leygues at a banquet at the Republican Club today can also prove that France has not only gained the upper hand in the army, but has also reached the supreme position in the navy. Leygues said that the French navy today can compete with the navy of any country in the world. Regardless of the type of warship, such as torpedo boats, destroyers, submarines, cruisers, top-tier warships, etc., France may not exceed other countries, but at least it can be on par with the United States, Britain, and Japan. Leygues further stated that France's newest warship, the Dunkerque, will soon be incorporated into the fleet. The ship's speed is 33 nautical miles per hour. According to naval officers from various countries, the ship is the strongest and most solid warship in the world, and with its numerous 14-inch and 12-inch guns, it can be called the "Queen of the Seven Seas."

<p>(London) The Economic Committee seems to have forgotten the rumor of the breakdown of the World Economic Conference and has now embarked on an ambitious agenda. If measured by the speed of business this morning, this agenda will keep the Economic Committee busy for several weeks. The public works item alone will cause a newly formed subcommittee to have a long discussion. In addition to public works, the Economic Committee must also deal with the Soviet Russian proposal for economic non-aggression, but the reason for the Soviet Russian proposal has been largely eliminated with the lifting of the British ban on Russian goods. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union will focus on the second section of its proposal, namely considering the possibility of expanding Soviet Russian imports by 100 million yuan and providing the necessary facilitation. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference held a plenary meeting this morning to discuss the French proposal on public works, the Soviet Russian proposal for economic truce, and the Soviet Russian proposal for developing the possibility of imports between countries. International Labour Bureau representative Chatkier spoke, strongly advocating large-scale public works under the International Cooperation Plan. The Italian representative spoke against international involvement, because the burden of international lending now needs to be reduced, especially in countries burdened with debt. International Labour Bureau employer representative Voesstaay advocated the organization of an international committee, under the guidance of the League of Nations, together with the League of Nations specialized agencies and representatives of various countries' governments to jointly plan and encourage public works around the world. The US delegation submitted a proposal advocating reducing working hours and increasing wages, with the increase in proportion to the increase in productivity around the world. The meeting decided to consider this proposal together with the French proposal. French representative Ukhot delivered his opinion with his famous impassioned eloquence, saying that public works are not a fundamental solution to the world economic panic, but a tool to alleviate the consequences of the world economic panic.

<p>Countries should prevent further reduction in the fineness of silver coins and consider using them to replace low-value banknotes. Obstacles to silver imports should be investigated and eliminated. (London) US representative Bittleman proposed another method this morning at the silver subcommittee meeting to replace his original proposal on silver, stipulating that the governments of the countries participating in the conference should prevent the further reduction in the fineness of their silver coins or the melting of silver coins, except for those that are melted and recast into new coins. The fineness of silver coins in each country should be at least 800 to 1,000, each suitable for their budgetary difficulties. Silver coins should be used to replace low-value banknotes in each country as appropriate, depending on budgetary conditions. Governments that levy taxes on silver imports must consider how to reduce or eliminate the obstacles to the free import of silver. Governments that do not levy taxes on silver imports must maintain their tax exemption. In any case, no taxes shall be levied exceeding the levels adopted by any major silver country such as Bolivia, Canada, China, the United States, India, Mexico, Peru, and Spain. The governments of the countries participating in the meeting shall instruct their central banks to consider whether silver can be used as part of their legal reserve to pay for currency or international settlements. Furthermore, the governments of the countries participating in the meeting, with the exception of the governments of India and Spain, shall agree not to sell silver obtained from melting silver coins before January 1, 1938. As for India and Spain, if the governments of these two countries have large amounts of silver in stock and believe that it can be sold, the governments of these two countries and the governments of major silver producing countries should devise an agreement so that the maximum limit of sales can be determined according to this agreement, and the amount sold can be offset by the purchase of the governments of silver producing countries. As for this silver, it can be used for currency purposes, or to mint silver coins, or as a currency reserve, or kept unused during the agreed period. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Song Ziwen, Following Russia and Turkey</p>
<p>Meets Italian Prime Minister Mussolini</p>
<p>Will Stay for Three Days Before Traveling to Germany and Belgium</p>
<p>Rome, the current capital of Italy, has once again become a center for diplomatic negotiations. Today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador, who had just returned to Italy from the Russian capital. Later, the Italian Prime Minister also met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ruşdi. Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen will meet with the Italian Prime Minister tomorrow to discuss Far Eastern affairs. The political circles believe that Mussolini's meeting with representatives from Russia and Turkey is related to the treaties recently concluded between Russia and Turkey, and that the representatives of both parties meeting with Mussolini is to state that the treaties concluded between the two countries do not affect the relationship between the two countries and Italy. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome Economic Conference Chinese representative Finance Minister Song Ziwen arrived here. Song intends to stay in Rome for only three days. Those around him said that Song's trip is partly for social engagements and partly to inspect the situation in Italy, the same as his inspections in Washington, London, and Paris. Song also intends to travel to Berlin and the capital of Belgium. Song will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini and Finance Minister Renke tomorrow. By the way, Prime Minister's son-in-law Count Ciano is the Italian minister, stationed in Shanghai for a long time, and has now returned to Rome quickly. Therefore, the relations between the Chinese government and the Italian government are very close. In terms of business between China and Italy, there are currently two things that are most important: one is that China will order aircraft from Italy, and the other is that Italian aviator Bena de Sis may be hired by China to take charge of the organization of Chinese aviation. Bei visited Song Ziwen today. Prime Minister Mussolini will invite Song for lunch tomorrow. In recent months, many Chinese personnel have come to Italy on official business. Now, with the arrival of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, it can be said to be the height of prosperity. Zhang Xueliang also lives in Rome in his own villa. (Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>The Italian newspaper "Restodel Carlino" in Rome published an article discussing the visit of Chinese representative Song Ziwen to Italy, stating briefly that "Since the recent Sino-Japanese ceasefire, the Chinese government has been eager to rectify its internal affairs and is preparing to cooperate with the League of Nations to seek internal construction. Since it wants to cooperate with the League of Nations, it will also be happy to endorse cooperation with the major European countries. This kind of cooperation is deemed indispensable in the report submitted by Lord Lytton, chairman of the Manchuria Investigation Team. China has recently adopted various measures to regulate import trade, which will be implemented from January 1, 1934. The key to this measure is to make the source of goods have a certain identification, so that people can know at a glance. Regarding this matter, Song Ziwen probably intends to reach a compromise with countries that have a large amount of goods imported into China. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>New York Chamber of Commerce Appreciates Benefits</p>
<p>Attitude Towards Russia Changes Again</p>
<p>(New York) The US-Russia Committee of the New York State Chamber of Commerce, appreciating the 100 million yuan import trade to Russia reported by Soviet Telegram three days ago, stated today that it has changed its attitude towards the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia in April. It now advocates inviting national celebrities to organize a committee to determine on what basis the US and Russia will resume diplomatic relations. It also cited the words of Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov at the London Economic Conference that Soviet Russia is prepared to purchase 100 million yuan worth of foreign goods, saying that if the US government can act quickly, most of this order can be obtained by American merchants. The excellent quality and reliable service of certain American goods have established credit in Soviet Russia. Therefore, business and diplomatic relations between the two countries should be restored immediately. It is hoped that, after careful study by celebrities representing all factions of opinions on Russia nationwide, a satisfactory foundation can be found. By the way, the committee just suggested in April that recognition should not be granted until Soviet Russia guarantees to fulfill its international debts. After fierce debate at the general meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, it was passed according to the original proposal. Now, because New York State accounts for most of the trade with Russia, the committee is reconsidering. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Yangtze River Water Level Has Gradually Stabilized <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Rescue Efforts Underway for Breached Dikes in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River water level in the upper reaches has gradually stabilized, and today, the 13th, all regions experienced clear skies. The water level in Wanxian has receded another eight feet, indicating a promising trend. The Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission released the water level readings for various locations on the 13th:</p>
<p>(1) Upper reaches: Chongqing 49.6 feet, 0.2 feet higher than the 12th; Wanxian 92.9 feet, 8.0 feet lower than the 12th; Yichang 40.4 feet, 0.9 feet lower than the 12th; Shashi 31.7 feet, 0.2 feet lower than the 12th.</p>
<p>(2) Middle reaches: Yuezhou 47.1 feet, 0.8 feet higher than the 12th; Hankou 45.7 feet, 0.3 feet higher than the 12th; Jiujiang 43.4 feet, same as the 12th; Anqing 38.0 feet, same as the 12th.</p>
<p>(3) Lower reaches: Wuhu 27.3 feet, 0.1 feet lower than the 12th; Nanjing 21.6 feet, 0.1 feet lower than the 12th; Zhenjiang 8.0 feet, 0.5 feet lower than the 12th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water rose three inches on the 13th, with the water mark at 45 feet 7 inches, nine inches from the bank. Yisha rose six inches, Changsha rose eight inches, and Yuezhou rose one foot six inches. However, Chongqing receded seven inches, reducing the level of danger. The Provincial Flood Control Committee, noting the increasingly severe leakage in the Wufeng Dike, determined four emergency rescue measures on the 13th, to be implemented starting on the 14th, including the construction of a transverse dike as the second line of defense for flood prevention. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually receded, easing public anxiety. Wanxian has receded another eight feet. Based on the timing, the flood season for this month has passed. If the weather remains favorable, there should be no risk of a sudden surge within the month. However, the dikes in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have suffered breaches in several locations due to the inability to discharge internal water and the backflow of external water, resulting in the submersion of extensive farmland. The Flood Prevention Committee is currently intensifying its supervision of staff to expedite rescue efforts. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has allocated an additional 50,000 yuan to the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Committee specifically for purchasing burlap sacks to be used in dike reinforcement projects. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>All Critical Engineering Works Are Simultaneously Under Pressure</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Yellow River at Luokou rose 2.7 decimeters, with the water level at 29.6 meters. At Dongzhuang in the upper reaches, the water rose 1.8 decimeters, nearing the highest water level of last year. All critical engineering works are simultaneously under pressure. Inspector Yang Zhenliang urgently reported on the night of the 12th that the tenth and fifth groynes of Li Shengtun in the upper reaches were submerged by about a foot. The seventh groyne had collapsed, with the front and rear sections at water level, making it difficult to maintain. By 11 PM, the top of the seventh groyne had eroded by more than two zhang both in front and behind, losing its shape. The River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed all county heads along the river today, urging them to quickly set up temporary shelters, supervise the district and village chiefs to diligently oversee the laborers, and cooperate with the assigned officials to defend the area. The bureau also telegraphed all river section chiefs and committee members to supervise the soldiers and laborers, patrol day and night, and defend the area as circumstances dictate.

<h3 id="e39">A Water Conservancy Expert Discusses the Avoidability of Floods in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>No Increase in Huai River Levels, Nor Hurricanes</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Recently, water levels have risen sharply across the country, attracting extreme attention from the government and the people regarding flood prevention efforts. People in Jiangsu Province are particularly concerned about the canal, and the provincial government is also paying full attention to the matter. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed a water conservancy expert yesterday. According to him, based on academic and practical considerations, Jiangsu Province is unlikely to experience a flood disaster this year. The reasons are: (1) Jiangsu, bordering the Yangtze, Huai, Yi, Si, and Shu Rivers, is the downstream destination for all these waters, making the situation extremely serious. However, precisely because it is located at the end of the waterways, drainage is easier, making a disaster less likely. (2) The causes of floods in Jiangsu are the four elements of Yangtze River, Huai River, tides, and winds. A severe disaster occurs when the Yangtze and Huai Rivers rise simultaneously, coinciding with a period of high tides (around the new and full moon), and exacerbated by a hurricane passing through. The situation becomes exceptionally serious. Even a slight lapse in protection will lead to a major disaster. When the Huai River flows into the Yangtze (the waters south of the Yangtze also flow into the Yangtze, hence the similar situations north and south of the Yangtze), and both the Huai and Yangtze Rivers rise, the source becomes vast and the downstream is blocked. Internal and external pressures combine, causing water levels to rise significantly. If this is compounded by a tidal backflow, the Yangtze River water cannot easily flow into the sea, preventing the Yangtze River water level from dropping, creating a crisis situation. If a hurricane strikes, it will inevitably cause waves that batter the dikes, making defense even more difficult. If defenses are inadequate or the personnel are ineffective, it will lead to a disaster. (3) The prediction for this year's situation is that only one-fourth of the aforementioned conditions are present; that is, only the Yangtze River water level is high. Recently, due to a sudden increase in tides (the highest tide was on the 10th of this month), the waters in the upper and middle reaches have not receded easily. However, the Huai River water level has not risen, and there is no sign of a hurricane. Therefore, a disaster is unlikely. Furthermore, from now on, the tide level will fall daily, making water recession easier. Not only will Jiangsu Province be spared from the threat of Yangtze River flooding, but the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can also be free from worry. Even if the Huai River were to rise again, it is estimated that the period of highest water level in the Yangtze River would only be extended by a maximum of twenty days. Half of that time has already passed. For the Huai River to rise to its maximum level, it would take at least ten days. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that there is no major threat. As for any breaches in the Yangtze River dikes, due to the terrain, the damage will only affect a small local area and will not impact the majority of Jiangsu Province.

<h3 id="e66">Italian Air Squadron Flies Across the Atlantic <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Lands on a Peninsula in Canada</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New Brunswick, 12th: The Italian air squadron arrived at Cartwright in Labrador at 12:30 PM today, completing the most difficult leg of its journey to Chicago. The next leg will be from Cartwright to Sazdes, a distance of only 750 miles, but navigation will be difficult. After arriving at Sazdes, they will fly another 500 miles to Montreal, and then to Chicago. When the Italian air squadron arrived here today, they came in groups of three to five. They began arriving at 3:10 PM, with several aircraft arriving every ten or forty minutes. The first aircraft was sighted at Cartwright at 1:50 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min Agency, New York, 12th: A message received via Mackay Radio states that the Italian air squadron safely arrived at Cartwright in Labrador at noon today. All aircraft are intact. The first aircraft landed at 2:50 PM, and the last aircraft landed at 5:20 PM. It is reported that after departing from Iceland, they flew in groups of three, encountering no difficulties along the way. After a stopover in Montreal, they plan to proceed to Chicago.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, New Brunswick, 12th: We received a radio message stating that the air squadron led by Italian Air Minister General Balbo has flown across the Atlantic from Iceland and arrived at Cartwright in Labrador, Canada.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min Agency, Cartwright, 13th: After the Italian air squadron arrived here from Iceland, Italian Air Marshal Balbo stated that the journey was extremely dangerous. They encountered strong headwinds and extremely bad weather immediately after departure. The clouds were heavy and low, and the sky was dark. The aircraft had to fly close to the sea surface, making it impossible to follow a set route. After the fifth hour, they flew into dense fog. The pilots could hardly see the lights on their own wings. In addition, the water droplets on the wings were suspected to be freezing, so they did not dare to fly above 300 feet. When they flew out of the heavy fog, the weather was slightly better. From the tenth to the twelfth hour, the weather was clear and cloudless, but the sea was stormy and the wind was treacherous. Moreover, they encountered strong headwinds throughout the journey, with the maximum speed not exceeding 125 miles per hour, further increasing the difficulty of the flight. Due to the bad weather, the aircraft were scattered from the beginning. But when they arrived here, they were still able to form groups of three. The pilots have demonstrated their excellent skills on this journey.</p>

<p>Rampant Kidnappings in the United States</p>
<h3 id="e68">Roosevelt Organizes Anti-Kidnapping Campaign <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 12th: Since the end of Prohibition, mobsters have lost a source of income, leading to rampant kidnapping cases across the country. President Roosevelt is now organizing a large-scale anti-kidnapping campaign. Roosevelt has ordered state officials to cooperate in solving the kidnapping cases of New York Democratic Party leader Walker O'Connell's nephew and the famous financier Feike. The O'Connell family expects Walker to be released within twelve hours and is said to be paying a ransom of $100,000. The exact amount is unknown. However, according to today's report, the Walker family is currently negotiating with the kidnappers. It is also reported that Feike's kidnappers sent a reply to the Feike family demanding a ransom of $200,000. According to the Feike family, they have no way to raise the ransom. Ruhl, an elderly banker from Alton, Illinois, was also kidnapped on Monday night. His family is trying to contact the kidnappers because Ruhl is old and frail.</p>
<h3 id="e69">This Year's Soviet Financial Budget <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The special characteristic of the Soviet financial budget is that it does not rely solely on tax revenue as its source of income. Instead, a significant portion of its income comes from the surplus of state-owned production enterprises. On the expenditure side, the largest portion is not allocated to government and military expenses, but rather to the expenses for operating various production, cultural, and construction projects. Therefore, the Soviet financial budget is essentially the culmination of the budgets of various production sectors, and its foundation is built on the budgets of industrial, agricultural, transportation, and other production enterprises. In addition, credit and social insurance are also important foundations. In other words, this budget is responsible for concentrating and allocating capital for the development of socialism and the economy, as well as concentrating funds from the people and allocating funds to the people. It is completely different from the financial budgets of capitalist countries. As for the agency responsible for formulating the budget, there is a special committee under the Central Executive Committee. This committee is responsible for formulating the central and federal financial budgets. The budgets of various departments form the basis for the central budget. As for local budgets, they are formulated by the local executive committees.</p>
<p>The financial budget for this year is described as follows: 1933 is the starting year of the second five-year plan, which is also the starting year of the second stage of development of the Soviet national economy. In this year's plan, the total industrial output value is expected to increase by 16.5% compared to last year. In terms of monetary value, the increase is 4.8 billion rubles (calculated at the prices of 1926-27).</p>
<p>In terms of railway transportation, it is expected that freight volume can be increased by 300 million tons, which is 12.5% in percentage terms. The total investment can reach 18 billion rubles. In terms of trade, capital can be increased by 6 billion rubles. The revenue and expenditure of the financial budget, which has been approved by the Budget and Financial Planning Department under the Central Executive Committee, is 35.011 billion rubles for revenue and 33.233 billion rubles for expenditure. Compared with 1932, the total budget has increased by 5 billion rubles (from 29.949 million to 35.011 million rubles), which is 16.9% in percentage terms. Under the expenditure items, there is no significant increase because there is a government surplus of 178 million rubles included.</p>
<p>(A) Revenue. The following table compares the revenue of 1932 and 1933:</p>
<p>1932　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1933</p>
<p>Amount (million rubles) Percentage of total revenue　Amount (million rubles) Percentage of total revenue</p>
<p>Item</p>
<p>Socialization of the national economy　　24719　　82.5　　28749　　82.1</p>
<p>Centralized private capital　　　4373　　14.6　　5364　　15.3</p>
<p>Other (such as taxes)　　　　857　　2.9　　898　　2.6</p>
<p>Total　　　　　　　　　29949　　100.0　　35011　　100.0</p>
<p>There are two main sources of revenue from the socialized national economy. One is from commercial operations. The form of this income is business tax. The second is the surplus allocated to the government from various economic organizations, such as the surplus of industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the revenue of railways, post offices, telegraph lines, and radio telegraphs.</p>
<p>The income from business tax ranks first in the financial budget revenue, with a total of 21.8 billion rubles, or 62.4% of the total revenue. The increase in this tax revenue depends on the production situation and the commercial situation of those who are obligated to pay taxes. In addition, changes in the prices of industrial products and daily necessities may also affect the business tax of various goods. In the 1933 budget, the change in tax rates is minimal, so the average tax rate of 1932 can be maintained. The reason why the business tax in 1933 can be increased by 4.4 billion rubles compared to 1932 is due to the more prosperous tax-paying trade than before. The comparison is as follows: (unit: million rubles)</p>
<p>Year　　　　Total number of tax-paying trades　　Tax amount　　　Average tax rate in percentage</p>
<p>1932　　43817　　17227　　39.3</p>
<p>1933　　54721　　21796　　39.7</p>
<p>Percentage of 1933 to 1932　　124.9　　136.8　　101.0</p>
<p>If the tax levied after the sale of special products calculated according to the selling price of 1932 is included in the revenue item of the previous budget, the total revenue can reach 23.5 billion rubles, or 67.2% of the total revenue. From this, it can be seen that two-thirds of the revenue must be transferred according to the situation of the national commodity trade. Fortunately, the market demand is very high. It is estimated that the 16.5% increase in industrial products in 1933 will not be able to meet the needs of the people and the socialized sector.</p>
<p>The second most important source of revenue in the budget is the accumulation of industry, credit institutions, and transportation. The total accumulation of the socialized sector is determined to be 20.2 billion rubles. The source of this total accumulation is to intensify production, increase freight volume, reduce the cost of industrial products, and increase the production capacity of workers according to the plan. Of this accumulation, 3.9 billion must be included in the financial budget revenue.</p>
<p>The second item in the budget revenue is tax revenue, which is the tax paid by the people, or the free contribution fee. The tax paid by the people is income tax. Those who pay this tax are workers and employees who are hired at high prices, as well as people who do not work but have income (owners of industrial and commercial enterprises, etc.). As for donations, they are used to subsidize the development of cultural and social undertakings. In addition, there are also donations to offset the tax amount that farmers who can only work but cannot pay taxes should pay. The total amount of this tax revenue is 215.2 million rubles, which is 6.1% of the total revenue. The second item of revenue increased by 38 million rubles compared to last year. The reason for the increase is the increase in the wages and salaries of employees in various national economic sectors, the increase in agriculture, and the increase in the number of workers.</p>
<p>The people's free donations raised in the form of reasonable government bonds are very important in terms of income. A part of economic construction is carried out by raising government bonds from the people. In recent years, due to the rapid progress of economic construction, the people's lives have become more stable due to the progress and expansion of economic construction. This phenomenon is tantamount to a solid barrier to the state's guarantee of government bonds. Therefore, whenever the government issues government bonds, the people are eager to subscribe. The government's debt, as of January 1, 1933, was 6.5 billion rubles. With the addition of various government bonds that must be raised again in 1933, the total amount by January 1, 1934, should reach 9 billion rubles. As for the relationship between government bonds and the people, it should be judged by the number of bondholders. The number of people in the Soviet Union who purchased government bonds was 8 million in 1928, 12 million in 1930, and increased to 40 million in 1932. The amount of government bonds allocated to the budget revenue item is 321.2 million rubles, which is 9.3% of the revenue.</p>
<p>In other aspects of income, there are a total of 500 million rubles in 1933. This is the subsidy from the highest social insurance agency for university scholarships. The reason why this amount is included in the budget is to make the calculation of scholarships simpler. The scholarships allocated by the social insurance agency actually only account for a portion of the total amount, and other parts still need to find other ways to inject funds. In addition, there are miscellaneous items in the income item, such as miscellaneous taxes (140 million rubles), and the amount transferred to the government from freight and passenger revenue (18.3 million rubles), etc. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Those Indicted are all Prominent Figures</p>
<p>Among them, Three Suspicions are the Most Important</p>
<p>According to the Nagoya Shimbun, due to the expansion of business in Kyoto City, illegal activities have continuously occurred between city officials, merchants in and out of the city, and contractors. Since Showa 3 (1928), the Kyoto Prefectural Criminal Investigation Division has obtained various scandals. It was not until March 16 of this year that conclusive evidence was obtained. After three months of investigation by the Kyoto District Public Prosecutors Office, 68 people who accepted and offered bribes were successively indicted. These criminals are all prominent figures such as senior officials, councilors, city councilors, and industrialists in Kyoto City, such as Minseito (Democratic Constitutional Party) councilor Kawahashi, Seiyukai (Friends of Constitutional Government) councilor Suzuki, city councilor Yagi, city government section chiefs, officers, engineers, and secretaries, who colluded with each other. Among them, there are three major suspicions that can be specially written about, namely, 1) the Nikiseki (Japan Oil) incident, in which Seiyukai councilors colluded with engineers and Japan Oil Company to bribe 20,000 yen for road construction; 2) the Funayama incident, in which oil merchant Funakoshi received several thousand yen in bribes for land readjustment; 3) the Daiichi Kogyo (First Industry) incident, in which councilor Suzuki received 6,000 yen in bribes to acquire the foundation of the Daiichi Kogyo school. Other incidents such as extorting thank-you money and accepting goods are too numerous to mention. Such a scandalous incident is truly the biggest stain in the history of Kyoto City.</p>
<h3 id="e71">### Various Parties' Movements After the Coup in Xinjiang Province <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Sheng Shicai is Wary of the Examples of Usurpation and His Subordinates are Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Huang Musong's Safety is Absolutely Not a Problem</p>
<p>The Central Government will have a Great Plan to Develop the Border Areas</p>
<p>Beijing News: After the second coup in Xinjiang Province, the central government is painstakingly planning and preparing, but after half a month, it is still unclear. According to related parties, the actual situation has been obtained, and the outline is described below for those who are concerned about the Xinjiang Province incident to refer to.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Reasons for the Second Coup <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>It was found that when the first Xinjiang coup broke out on April 12, the initiators who opposed Jin Shuren were actually Tao Mingyue, Chen Zhong, and a small number of lower-ranking military officers. Due to the deep resentment of the people, Jin fled in a panic. At that time, Sheng Shicai was confronting Ma Zhongying's troops in Jichang (about a hundred miles away from Dihua). Upon hearing the news, he rushed back. After a few days, under the guidance of Tao and Chen, he was elected by the People's Congress to appoint Sheng Shicai and Liu Wenlong to lead the military and political affairs, and the matter came to an end. Tao and Chen were the key figures in the new coup. After Sheng took over as the Border Defense Commissioner, he was wary of the examples of usurpation in Xinjiang Province in the past. Tao and Chen, relying on their merits, were arrogant and indulgent, and things were unavoidable. Therefore, mutual suspicion deepened, and the cause of the second coup was conceived. When the central government specially sent Huang Musong as the envoy of comfort, if he had immediately started the festival, traveled lightly and simply, and flew to Dihua, Ma Zhongying would have no intention of trying again, and Liu Sheng might not have excessive thoughts. At that time, it would have been impossible to take advantage of the situation. Unfortunately, Huang recruited talents and prepared for the economy, and his actions were delayed. When he arrived in Xinjiang Province, it was when Tao and Chen were harboring their hopes. Tao and others flattered Huang as a senior member of the central government, which was the strength of a villain. Huang had no other thoughts in his heart, but Sheng and Liu became more and more worried. Therefore, based on one-sided actions, killing Tao was not enough, and they suspected that Huang had the intention of taking away their power.</p>
<h3 id="e73">After Jiang and Wang's Public Telegrams <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After the central government received Liu Shengjian's telegram report, the director of the province's Beijing office, Zhang Fengjiu, and the party affairs instructor, Peng Zhaoxian, sent telegrams to Liu Sheng, explaining the central government's attitude and inquiring about the truth of the incident. As for the public telegrams issued by Chairman Chiang and President Wang, due to the distance, it would take until around the 20th to receive a reply. However, Peng Zhaoxian recently received another telegram from Sheng, which stated, "In this Xinjiang coup, I was forced by the environment to maintain the situation. The rumors are untrue, which is a pity. I welcome Wenjing's visit to the west and hope to come soon to be encouraged. As for the Xinjiang incident, it was purely caused by Ma bandits causing chaos. Now Ma bandits have led the remnants of six or seven hundred people to collapse and retreat to Shanshan. I am preparing to pursue them in order to thoroughly eliminate them. If Ma bandits are eliminated, then everything will be solved easily." This situation has been telegraphed to Chairman Chiang." After receiving the telegram, Peng sent another telegram to encourage Liu Sheng's attitude of always obeying the central government and to pay attention to the safety of Huang, the envoy of comfort, again and again. Respecting Huang is respecting the central government, and it is explained that Huang's visit to Xinjiang has absolutely no intention of usurping power, and it is hoped that there will be no further misunderstandings. Regarding all the aftermath, it will be discussed in detail after the new situation is reached. This telegram was sent the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Central Government's Attitude Towards Handling the Situation <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The general cause of the second coup in Xinjiang Province has been described above. What attitude will the central government hold in the future? This is what the general public urgently wants to know. According to the opinions of various military and political authorities, President Wang reported in the Administrative Yuan Memorial Weekly a few days ago (Monday) that "the three things mentioned in the Xinjiang incident, namely, first, diplomacy must be unified under the central government; second, military affairs must be unified under the central government; and third, religion must be free and ethnic groups must be equal. These three are the major goals of the future administration of Xinjiang, and they are also the crystallization of Wang Jiang's exchange of telegrams to deal with the new changes in the past half month. If Liu Sheng expresses a clear compliance with this, and Huang Musong has not suffered excessive embarrassment in Xinjiang, then the order to remove Liu Sheng from his position will not be clearly seen. As for the effective development of Xinjiang Province in the future, the central government has recently had detailed discussions in a high-level meeting, and there is a strong momentum for it to be implemented. The scope is heard not only limited to Xinjiang Province, but it should be the second step in the plan to administer Xinjiang."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Peng and Gong's Departure is Near <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>After the second change in Xinjiang, President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei summoned Zhang Fengjiu and Gong Bicheng to inquire about ways to quell the chaos, and instructed Gong to return to Xinjiang with Peng Zhaoxian to investigate the truth. At the same time, he ordered Huang, the envoy of comfort, to return to Beijing as soon as possible. However, as of today, Gong and Peng's departure date has been postponed, and Huang's return is undecided. The truth of the matter is enough to make people speculate. Yesterday, Peng Zhaoxian said, "President Wang did talk to Mr. Gong at one time and instructed me to go to Xinjiang immediately, but my office has never received a formal order, so I have not been able to make the trip. If the central government does have this intention, I will certainly comply. However, the party affairs instructor Cao Qiwen has already taken a plane to Xinjiang yesterday (11th) morning. Once Mr. Cao arrives, he will first report the recent situation of the province here. Whether the departure date is still pending. Yesterday, Dong Shuizhen and Yang Mengzhou, two of Sheng's acquaintances, also went to Xinjiang together. Dong was invited by Sheng's telegram. Also, Mr. Wang Ziyao, the representative of Li Du, also took the same plane to Xinjiang." Peng said at the end that the safety of Huang, the envoy of comfort, he guarantees will definitely not be a problem, because Huang and Sheng have very friendly personal relations. Even if there is a slight misunderstanding in the public aspect, it will soon be dispelled.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Fengjiu Returned to Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Fengjiu, director of the Xinjiang Office in Beijing, returned to Beijing yesterday (12th) after being summoned to Ganzhou by Chairman Chiang a few days ago. According to Zhang, "I was summoned to Ganzhou this time and transferred to Mount Lu, where I met Chairman Chiang. Chiang paid unusual attention to the Xinjiang incident and inquired in detail. However, because he was busy with the work of suppressing bandits, he ordered me to return to Beijing first to meet President Wang and said that the detailed measures had been telegraphed to Wang and all the problems could be solved in Beijing. Therefore, after arriving in Beijing by plane at 10 o'clock this morning, I went to see President Wang and received instructions from the central government on the intention to resolve the Xinjiang incident, and immediately ordered Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian to go to Xinjiang to mediate the disputes, with the principle of taking into account the prestige of the central government and complying with local public opinion. What names the two will go in is currently being discussed, and it will probably be announced within a few days. They will set off when the Eurasia plane departs next Tuesday. The order to remove Liu Sheng from the position of chairman and governor of Xinjiang Province will be decided after Gong and Peng arrive in Xinjiang." He also said that Liu Sheng's emergency resolution of the internal changes in the Xinjiang Provincial Government and the execution of Tao, Chen, and Li were entirely because Tao and others attempted a riot, so he had no choice but to deal with it in this way. As for the central government officials, he absolutely supports them. The various rumors outside may not be reliable.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Outline of Liu Sheng's Resume <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The current situation in Xinjiang Province is that Sheng and Liu are responsible for the military and political power. Therefore, the experience of the two and their prestige in Xinjiang, as well as their relationship with the central government, seem to have the value of being recorded. It is found that Liu Wenlong is old and has served as an official in Xinjiang Province for more than 30 years. He usually handles things and is still popular with the people, so he has the reputation of Liu Qingtian. In the past, due to his position, he rarely approached the central government, and few people knew about him and his actions. Sheng Shicai graduated from the Japanese Army University. After returning to China, he served as the lieutenant colonel section chief of the General Headquarters here in the 17th year of the Republic of China. He had great talent. In the year, the central government participated in the military opportunities for the Feng and Yan campaigns. Gu Yao Chiang's Commander in Chief gave Qing. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, through the introduction of Peng Zhaobao, the current party affairs instructor of Xinjiang Province, he went to Xinjiang to serve as the chief of the staff office of the Border Defense Governor's Office. At first, he had no name. Until Ma Zhongying rebelled against Jin for the first time in the past (Shuren), Jin's troops were defeated. Sheng took the opportunity to offer suggestions and set a date and place to quell the Ma chaos. Jin Yun's request was then granted the position of acting chief of staff and granted full power. As a result, everything was as expected and the turmoil was quelled as scheduled. Jin was greatly appreciated and truly removed the chief and concurrently served as the president of the military school in the province. Since then, all matters related to the military have been planned by Sheng, and the potential power has gradually increased. This time, he has gained military power. Sheng is 37 this year and studied under Chairman Chiang and Huang Musong, the envoy of comfort, who were originally classmates. (Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Chiang is Temporarily Stationed in Mount Lu <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Visited Fuzhou</p>
<p>Currently Planning to Establish a Mountain Climbing School</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Zhu Mao shifted their target from southern Jiangxi to eastern Jiangxi the year before last, Fuzhou has become the military center for suppressing the Red Army. Moreover, the false 135th Army Corps has repeatedly needed to attack northward in full force, hoping to seize Fuzhou in order to enter Naxun and break through the Yangtze River. At the beginning of last month, Zhu Mao personally led the false 452nd and other armies of Lin Biao, Luo Binghui, and Dong Zhentang, protruding from Yihuang upstream of the Fu River and invading the suburbs of Fuzhou. The momentum was fierce. Chairman Chiang considered that the Red bandits had left their nests and penetrated deeply, and it was necessary to take advantage of the opportunity to severely suppress them. Therefore, on the 19th, after attending the county magistrate's meeting and giving instructions, he took a car on the Ganmin Road to Fuzhou and stationed in the Eighth Middle School, working in the Governor's Office set up by Liu Zhi a few days ago. Chiang's arrival in Fuzhou was also to personally serve as the commander of the Northern Route Army to direct military affairs on the front line. After Chiang arrived in Fuzhou, he immediately summoned various generals to give instructions, gave face-to-face instructions, and limited the immediate advance to Yihuang. At that time, the various departments in eastern Jiangxi were encouraged by Chiang's personal supervision, and their morale was boosted. They immediately drove the bandits who had invaded the vicinity of Fuzhou out of the country and lifted the siege of Yihuang on the 25th. In addition to visiting Nancheng Chongren and Yihuang, Chiang also repeatedly summoned Li Siqiu and other departments who had newly arrived in Fuzhou to give instructions, encouraging them to work hard to eliminate the bandit scourge. It is estimated that about five or six divisions of people have been added to Jiangxi from other provinces in the past month. They have all been concentrated in Kou and opened to the Koukou front line. Therefore, the various departments in Yihuang followed the bandits and have reached Koukou and other places south of Yihuang. Zhu Mao's main force retreated to the areas bordering Yile and Ningdu, such as Zhaoxie, Dongbi, Xiaotian, Huangpi, and Xiaopu. According to information from various sources, Zhu Mao used the five provinces to encircle them in three routes, and the date of death has arrived. They are currently discussing countermeasures and discussing each other's claims. 1) Attack Fuzhou with all their strength; 2) Take Fang Shao as the vanguard and flee east to western Zhejiang to build a new nest; 3) Attack Ji'an in the west or Ganzhou in the south to seize the central city. The opinions of the bandits are divided, so there is no decision. Recently, they are still lurking in the dangerous mountainous areas south of Huangpi. The various departments in eastern Jiangxi have strictly sealed off the bandit areas south of Yile Chong and set up defenses on dangerous terrain. Once the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian armies have captured Tingzhou and Huichang, they will simultaneously divide into routes to Ningdu for encirclement. Chiang, having made arrangements in Fuzhou, urgently needed to deal with military affairs in the rear, and returned to the province on the 6th.</p>
<p>After Chiang returned to the province, considering that the bandits have used the complex mountains and rugged roads to seek long-term defense, he decided to train lower-level officers for mountain warfare in order to command. Therefore, there is the establishment of a mountain climbing school. It is said that the school site is selected on the southern foot of Mount Lu, and the students are selected from the Central Military Academy and lower-level officers, and after training, they are transferred to the front line as a vanguard for suppressing bandits in mountain warfare. Therefore, Chiang took a Ford aircraft from the province to Jiujiang on the afternoon of the 9th of this month and transferred to Mount Lu to preside over everything. The school will be officially opened soon. (July 10)</p>

<p>The case of the robbery at Cai Peida's home in Xihutang, Punan, where more than 16,000 yuan was stolen last month on the 28th night, was solved by Fan Zhicheng, the captain of the first water police team, who arrested two suspects, Liang Awu, a coolie, and Liu Asan, from Caojing, and escorted them to the county government for interrogation. County Magistrate Jin ordered an investigation. The two criminals confessed to receiving twenty yuan in stolen money each and claimed to know nothing else. Considering the seriousness of the case, their confessions were copied and sent with a formal document. Police Chief Dong Futang and others escorted Liang and Liu to Zhenjiang Security Office by train yesterday for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yang Geseng, the head of the county Public Security Bureau, recently transferred the heads of the Waigang and Loutang Public Security Sub-bureaus. After receiving the order, Jin Jisheng, the head of the Waigang Sub-bureau, handed over his duties and went to Loutang in September to take over. Pan Jixiang, the head of the Loutang Sub-bureau, was on leave, and Secretary Feng Yifei informed Jin that he should wait for Pan to return to the bureau and hand over the duties in person, as he could not act without authorization. Jin insisted on taking over immediately, causing a dispute that reached outside the bureau. Tang Wenpei, the head of the Baoan Corps, and others rushed to the scene upon hearing the commotion and persuaded Jin not to argue. Jin, considering Tang's words to be biased, accused him of being the mastermind. The Baoan Corps then gathered all the members of the town's militia and marched to Jin to question him. The incident was finally calmed down by Mei Zude, the fifth district chief, who rushed to mediate. Jin, unable to take over despite the order, returned to the county bureau to complain. Director Yang left the bureau for Shanghai the same day, as the mutual transfer of the sub-bureau chiefs had not been approved by the county government. The dispute has not yet been resolved. Zhou Jing and others in Loutang Town have jointly petitioned the county government to reduce the scope of the bureau and save expenses.</p>

<p>In the past two days, the county water patrol team has successively captured many notorious bandits.

These bandits were all accomplices of the executed Geng Mazi and Wang Guangheng. There are still fugitives at large, and efforts are being made to capture them. The capture of this large number of bandit leaders has greatly pleased the residents.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Insane Woman Accuses Husband of Colluding with Bandits <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>At around 2 PM on the 10th, a woman in her forties, weeping bitterly, rushed to the first court of the county government, claiming to have an important case to report and requesting the magistrate to open the court. Her attempts to stop were unsuccessful, and the trial was presided over by Huang. According to the woman's statement, her name was Lu Qian, 47 years old, residing at Tajiao Bridge outside Xiaodongmen. Her husband, Song Song, was colluding with bandits at home. Every night, many people would enter and exit her house. Her husband's bed had a hidden mechanism, with a hemp rope connected directly to the outside, one end tied to a brick and the other to his body. If someone activated it, her husband would get up to greet them. She had repeatedly advised him to stop, but he had beaten her. Fearing future trouble, she had come to report. If they did not believe her, they could inspect her house, she said. Judge Huang, according to her statement, found the matter strange and immediately dispatched bailiffs to secretly detain Lu Songsong at the county. He also went to Lu's house to investigate. The neighbors all gossiped, generally saying that Lu was honest, and that Qian may have a mental illness, as she had been seen at the Public Security Bureau many times. After Songsong arrived at the county, the county government questioned him again. Qian still claimed that her husband was a kidnapper. In the first year of the Republic, he had been detained for robbing rice. When questioned, Lu Songsong claimed to be 57 years old, making paper lanterns for a living, and was usually peaceful and dared not collude with bandits. What his wife said was completely false. At this point, Songsong's son, Lu Shengzai, also turned himself in, claiming that his mother had a mental illness and her statement should not be believed. As a result, the court ordered Lu Songsong to be released on bail, pending further investigation by the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>Every year at the end of the academic year, the Bureau of Education is required to reappoint principals. However, the education sector here is divided by factions, making it difficult to handle affairs. This year, the Bureau of Education dismissed twenty-four principals. The successors have not yet been announced. The principals of the larger schools in the county have been appointed first, including Zhu Yinli, principal of the Rural Normal School, Sun Gongyuan, principal of the County Middle School, Yang Junhe, principal of the Shimei Elementary School, Liu Gongpu, principal of the Xigang Elementary School, and Tong Shizhong, principal of the Bailingcang Elementary School.</p>

<p>The Silk Filature Industry Association of this county received letters yesterday from members such as Qia Changxiang, Xie Xing and other silk filatures, as well as Xu Shaowen and other silk firms, stating that the local Business Tax Bureau has sent personnel to various firms, setting deadlines for filling out declaration forms and implementing taxation. However, each firm already holds a broker's license, which is called a business license, and the tax collected is called a business tax. Now, the Business Tax Bureau is imposing taxes again, which is tantamount to double taxation for one industry. After the decline of the silk and cocoon industry, it is really unbearable. They requested the county Chamber of Commerce to strive for their benefit. At the same time, the association also received letters from Li Zhaoji, Wang Yansheng, and other raw silk factories, stating that the silk and cocoon industry has failed for many years, and the current business tax rate of 0.2% based on last year's revenue is already difficult to bear. However, the Business Tax Bureau has recently increased the business tax rate to 0.5%, which is really unbearable. They also requested the county Chamber of Commerce to strive for maintaining the original rate of 0.2%. After approving the letters, the association immediately forwarded them to the county Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to strive for the industry's benefit with the Business Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>Hua Guoxiang, a doorman at the Lixin Cloth Factory outside the North Gate, Huishang Bridge, 46 years old, a native of this county, has been working as a doorman at the factory for five or six years. He has not married and has quite a lot of savings. This year, during the Spring Festival, Hua used his savings to gamble, losing more than one hundred yuan. Afterwards, he became depressed, thinking about his years of savings being wasted in one day, and his nerves became abnormal. Recently, Hua suddenly had the thought of ending his life. At around 3 AM the night before, he sneaked into the factory's woodworking room and hanged himself. By the time he was discovered, he had already died. The town chief Huang Xisan of the 16th Tu reported the incident to the county court for inspection. The inspector, led by Prosecutor Ren, confirmed that it was a case of suicide by hanging. The factory handled the body with a coffin. Also, Ma Xilao, a resident of Zhongqiao Town, Yangming Township, the third district, over 70 years old, was scolded by his daughter-in-law Hu for a trivial matter a few days ago, and she threw feces on his face. Xilao was blind and unable to dodge. After being humiliated, he hanged himself at home behind people's backs yesterday. His son Helang is now handling the funeral arrangements. Also, Chen Guofa, a worker at the Yu Socks Factory in Xianlitun outside the West Gate, went swimming in the nearby ice pond on the afternoon of the day before, due to the hot weather. However, Chen was not a good swimmer and drowned. Yesterday, Zhang Jintai, the town chief of the 23rd and 5th Tu in the area, reported the incident to the court for inspection. Also, Shi Rong, a water carrier from Jiangbei who worked in Donghetou Alley in the city, was walking with a water bucket on his shoulder yesterday morning when an electric wire in the area fell in the wind, hitting Shi on the head. Shi tried to resist with his left hand, but upon contact, he immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. Fortunately, Sun Hanquan, a resident of the area, saw him and immediately hired a car to send him to the Guangfumen Sanatorium for treatment. However, his left hand was severely burned, and his brain was violently shocked, leaving him in a coma and in critical condition.</p>

Construction has already begun. However, Yan Juecang, the abbot of the Xuanmiao Temple, fearing that various miscellaneous items in the temple would be driven out after the Zhongshan Hall was built, which would greatly affect his income, filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Provincial People's Office, accusing Zhang Yipeng, the director of the preparatory committee, of destroying historical sites and encroaching on temple property. The Civil Affairs Office ordered the county to investigate and reply. The county government yesterday submitted the process of initiating the construction to the Civil Affairs Office for approval.</p>

<p>Zhonghe Bookstore is located at No. 41 Zhongshan Road, and No. 40 next door is Baicheng Bookstore. The houses there are all owned by Hong Bai. At around 1 AM yesterday, Zhonghe Bookstore caught fire due to an electrical fault and was suddenly burned down. After discovering the fire, the store originally hoped to extinguish it themselves, without making a sound, so as to avoid the books and goods being soaked in water. When the patrol police saw smoke coming from the bookstore and broke down the door, the fire had already spread. Zhang Yaoqing and others from Baicheng Bookstore helped to put out the fire, but it was impossible to control. The fire brigade rushed to the scene, but could not extinguish the fire except for the nearby Bank of China, Mei Hua Shoe Store, and He Quanwai. The Zhonghe and Baicheng bookstores were completely destroyed. However, in the chaos, Zhou Xiandong, the small shopkeeper of Zhonghe Bookstore, escaped with the account book and was detained by the police at the bureau. After interrogation by Pan, the director of the Second Branch Bureau, Zhou Renxi, the major shareholder of Zhonghe Bookstore, Chen Xianting, the small shareholder and manager, and Zhang Yaocheng, the manager of Baicheng Bookstore, testified that the fire in Zhonghe Bookstore was indeed caused by an electrical fault. Zhonghe lost about 10,000 yuan, and Baicheng lost about 5,000 yuan including goods. After hearing the testimony, Director Pan, considering that neither bookstore was insured and that it was a natural disaster, ordered them to provide proper guarantees and released them temporarily. Zhonghe Bookstore has set up a temporary office at the Huayang Hotel to handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>There have been frequent bandit alarms in the upper reaches of the Changhuai River in recent months, and travelers have been wary. Bandits were previously discovered in Shitoubu, Fengtai County, robbing merchants and travelers. The Changhuai River Water Public Security Bureau, considering that the bandits' activities hindered water security, specially sent Director Wang Qi from Bengbu to lead a commando battalion to suppress them. After receiving the order, Wang led the team and set off, heading west by ship. The bandits, hearing that the water police were coming to suppress them, knew it would be difficult to stand their ground and fled. Therefore, when the team passed through Tianjiamiao, Shitoubu, and Fengtai County, the area was peaceful as usual, and there were no bandits. Wang then led the team upstream and arrived at Zhengyangguan, where he met Xu Zhongyue, the brigade commander of the 40th Independent Brigade of the stationed army, to discuss defense issues. However, since the bandits had already fled far away, there was no need to stay there for long. Yesterday, he led the team back to Bengbu and reported the situation of the patrol.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Proposed Principles for Through Train Service <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory committees for the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways were jointly established by personnel from the Ministry of Railways and representatives from the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai railways. Another meeting was convened to discuss the management of the ferry and the preparation for the direct train service between the two railways. Regarding the through train service, the committee has now proposed the following three principles: (1) From the date of the official through train service between the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways, a direct passenger train will run between Shanghai and Beijing daily (schedule to be determined). (2) A total of seven passenger trains (number of cars to be determined) will be drawn from each railway, dedicated to the Shanghai-Beijing through train service. (3) The trains to be allocated by each railway should be proportional to the mileage of each railway, with five trains from Tianjin-Pukou, one from Beining, and one from Beijing-Shanghai. (The above measures were proposed by the Through Train Preparatory Committee, but the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration felt that there was a shortage of vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, so they have submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways to borrow three third-class passenger cars from the Jiaoji Railway, two second-class passenger cars from the Pinghan Railway, and three freight cars from the two railways themselves, which will be combined to form a train.) The above three principles will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and implementation within the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Stipulated Ferry Ticket Price <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>As for the passenger ferry ticket price, the Through Train Preparatory Committee decided that the Xiaguan River surface is ten li (actually only six or seven li), with first and second class tickets at 30 cents, and third and fourth class tickets at 17 cents. The freight rate for goods is 1.5 yuan per ton from Nanjing to Pukou upstream and 2 yuan per ton from Pukou to Nanjing downstream. However, the maximum at one time shall not exceed 1,200 tons. However, the railway authorities believe that this method is likely to be opposed by passengers and merchants, because the goods are transported on the same ferry, and the river crossing fee should not be charged differently for upstream and downstream, which will affect the direct freight transport of the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways. In order to reduce the burden on passengers and merchants, it has recently instructed the Preparatory Committee to reduce the freight rate for goods crossing the river as much as possible within the possible range, and to abolish the names of upstream and downstream, and charge the same fee.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Ferry Management Matters <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>As for the management of the Changjiang Hao ferry, the Ministry of Railways has instructed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to be responsible for handling it. The Tianjin-Pukou side has a port affairs section, and there are very good warehouses on both sides of the river, which are very convenient for loading and unloading goods on the ferry. The Nanjing freight yard of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is located next to the Xiaguan Station, which is very far from the Changjiang Hao ferry terminal. Loading and unloading are inconvenient, and transshipment will take more time. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways handed over the management of the ferry to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>The Difficulties of Rescued Passengers and Crew of the Sunken Tunan</p>
<h3 id="e104">Japanese Refuse to Carry Crew Members <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Fifty-three crew members and thirty-six passengers rescued by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan ship arrived in Dalian at 10 AM on the 11th. Because they were waiting for the head office to send a ship to pick them up, the eighty-nine rescued crew members and passengers had been staying in Dalian for three days. The Shanghai office first sent a letter to the Dalian Steamship Company, requesting that a ship be sent to carry these rescued crew members and passengers to Shanghai, or to take the company's Dalian-Shanghai liner to Shanghai. However, the company did not reply to the letter sent on the 10th. Then the bureau sent someone to negotiate, but the Shanghai Dalian Steamship Company pushed the responsibility to the head office and refused to load these rescued crew members and passengers to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Xinfeng Sails to Dalian <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng originally did not order the Xinfeng to go to Dalian to pick up the crew members. However, because the Japanese merchants had clearly refused the bureau's request to carry eighty-nine people to Shanghai, he had to telegraph the Xinfeng ship, which was going south from Tianjin, to sail to Dalian to pick up these crew members and passengers to Shanghai. According to yesterday's news, the Xinfeng had departed from Zhifu for Dalian yesterday afternoon and would be able to load the rescued crew members and passengers last night and sail to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the Jinliyuan Wharf at around 3 PM tomorrow. The bureau has appointed a special commissioner to take care of everything at the wharf together with the Junan Association.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Already Loaded on Tianjin Maru <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the China Merchants Bureau telegraphed its Tianjin and Yantai branches and the Xinfeng ship the day before yesterday, ordering them to quickly sail to Dalian to transfer the rescued crew members and passengers to Shanghai. At the same time, it telegraphed the Dalian agency to find a way to quickly transfer the rescued crew members and passengers to Shanghai by ship. Yesterday morning, it received a telegram from the Yantai branch that the Xinfeng ship had departed from Yantai for Dalian on the 13th and would no longer sail to Weihaiwei and would sail directly to Shanghai. It also received a telegram from the Dalian agency that the Tianjin Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company refused to transfer the rescued crew members and passengers. At 4 PM, another telegram was received stating that after the agency sent someone to negotiate, it was decided that the Tianjin Maru would transfer them and had departed from Dalian at noon on the 13th. It needs to sail to Qingdao and then to Shanghai. It takes twelve hours from Dalian to Qingdao, eight hours in Qingdao, and twenty-eight hours from Qingdao to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, and at the latest tomorrow morning. All fifty-three crew members will come to Shanghai, but only a few of the thirty-six passengers have returned to Yantai and Yingkou from Dalian. As for the Xinfeng ship, it will still sail to Dalian.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Liu and Deng's Telegram Reply to the Abolish War Association <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Equally Criticizing Liu Wenhui</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Abolish Civil War Alliance has recently received the following telegrams from Liu Xiang and Deng Xihou:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Liu Xiang's Reply Telegram <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>To the Anti-War Grand Alliance and All Newspapers: Red bandits have invaded Sichuan, and Cangxi and Langzhong are successively reporting emergencies. I, Xiang, have repeatedly received clear orders from the Central Government to devise plans to suppress the bandits. Both local sentiment and my official duty do not allow for delay. Unfortunately, the war between Liu and Deng has broken out. At this time, despite repeated explanations, it is difficult to resolve the conflict. It is no secret that Sichuan province has become accustomed to regional separatism. Even in peacetime, there is strict mutual defense, and once war breaks out, all sides become even more entangled. I, Xiang, need to organize all the armies and assign tasks to comprehensively suppress the bandits. However, those at war are fighting on their own, not listening to any orders to stop. Those not yet at war are also being held back by these entanglements, causing worry and doubt to arise. This allows the red bandits to burn and destroy more each day. Who is obstructing us? It pains me to say. I have investigated that when the red bandits initially fled, they only captured Tongnan. Tian's army attacked with force and soon recovered it. However, because the war in western Sichuan broke out, Tian's army withdrew part of its forces for defense, allowing the embers of the defeated bandits to reignite their fierce flames. Moreover, Liu Wenhui took advantage of the fact that Xiang and Li Qixiang's troops were mobilizing to suppress the bandits, moving his troops to the west to pressure Rong Jian and to the east to threaten Liang Zi. On one hand, he continued to release water from the dams against Deng's army, constantly attacking, while falsely offering peace and ignoring loyal advice. Now that the internal strife has not stopped, the two armies themselves cannot undertake the bandit suppression work. Tian's troops are even more lacking in pay and provisions, exhausted from supporting the effort. The various departments are divided in their efforts, looking before and after. With such scattered troops encountering cunning and notorious communist bandits, a single unsuccessful attack will inevitably lead to further devastation. Moreover, Wenhui's constant internal strife, like draining a pond to catch fish or scattering seeds to drive away sparrows, has led to the hoisting of red flags and calls to resist taxation in various counties such as Qionglai, Pujiang, Mingshan, and Dayi in southern Sichuan. The red flames in northern Sichuan are blazing, and the surging waves in southern Sichuan are rising again. The red tide threatens to wash over the entire Sichuan, a truly terrifying prospect. I, Xiang, have both public and private feelings for Wenhui and sincerely hope that he will return from his wayward path and not stray too far. Therefore, even though I have been subjected to criticism from all sides, I have endured it. However, as the bandit threat increases daily and he continues on his misguided path, with both superiors and inferiors placing blame, I, Xiang, to stop the internal strife and cooperate in suppressing the communists, besides using a large portion of funds to subsidize the armies of Tian Songyao, Liu Jizhi, and Yang Zihui to defend against and suppress the red bandits and to contain their incursions, will also send a portion of troops westward to stop the internal strife. I hope that within a short period of time, obstacles can be removed so that we can pool our strength and cooperate together. This will allow us to comprehensively plan the overall situation, so that our strength is not divided, and we can be confident in suppressing the communists. Otherwise, the various armies will not be able to resolve their concerns, and the bandit suppression efforts will be difficult to be thorough. While it may seem urgent on the outside, it will actually be delayed, and any changes along the way will inevitably lead to major mistakes. It is my duty to defend our homeland and protect our fellow villagers. Compelled by righteousness, I will not complain of labor or resentment. Only when the red bandits are not eliminated and the people's suffering awaits relief, I, Xiang, for the sake of suppressing the red bandits and securing Sichuan, must simultaneously remove obstacles. I sincerely fear that various parties will not understand, and doubts and slanders will arise. Furthermore, those who create chaos will spread rumors, distorting the facts, confusing public opinion, and taking the opportunity for private gain, making right and wrong unclear and burying public justice. Therefore, I have briefly stated the general situation. I earnestly hope that you will carefully consider the situation in Sichuan, advocate for righteousness, and hope that the future of Sichuan depends on victory. I am filled with anticipation. This is my telegram to inform you, Liu Xiang bows, Geng.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Deng Xihou's Telegram <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>To the Anti-War Alliance: I received your telegram, earnestly advising and encouraging me to suppress the red bandits and cease hostilities. How dare I disobey? This time, Liu Wenhui has provoked trouble without cause, attacking our army, disregarding the national crisis, and showing no regard for the lives of the people. It has been two months since this began. I have sent repeated telegrams clearly stating the situation, hoping that you will understand. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly telegraphed Wenhui to quickly return to his original defenses and not to act without authorization. Premier Wang also sent a telegram on June 6th, ordering him to cease hostilities and return to his defenses. The Alliance and the Sichuanese comrades have also sent letters and telegrams to advise and guide him, but Wenhui has ignored them all. To this day, he continues to attack without stopping, showing no remorse for the disaster he has caused, and hindering the suppression of the bandits. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed. His disregard for the Central Government and his obstinate and chaotic heart are extremely obvious. The Alliance deeply loves peace and upholds justice. I earnestly request that you forward the situation of Wenhui starting chaos and causing disaster in Sichuan, as well as his reckless militarism, to the Central Government. He should be punished appropriately and denounced to the people of the nation to warn those who engage in internal wars. This will clarify right and wrong and uphold public justice, so that the Sichuan situation can be settled quickly, allowing Supervisor Liu Xiang to coordinate the suppression of the bandits and provide peace to the common people. I cannot express my anticipation enough. Deng Xihou bows, Seal.</p>

<p>General Su to Go to Jiangsu, General Li to Enter Beijing</p>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji and Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang hosted a banquet at the Xinghua Restaurant on Fourth Avenue at 7 PM last night for Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until after 9 PM before dispersing. General Su Bingwen has recently suffered from neurasthenia and is currently under medical treatment. However, due to the noisy nature of Shanghai, he plans to go to Jiangsu for recuperation within two or three days. General Li Du will also go to Beijing within two or three days to report the progress of the anti-Japanese war to the Central Government. He will then go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, before returning to Shanghai to recuperate.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Silk Factory Strike in the Concession Area Resolved This Morning <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Shuang Gong Factory Also Strikes, Demanding Wage Increase</p>
<p>Single Palace Factories Have Agreed to Issue Supplementary Wages to Workers</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs persuaded workers in local silk factories to restore their treatment, a misunderstanding arose at the Jiyu Factory in the Zhabei district the day before yesterday over bonuses and wages, leading to a strike. After persuasion by the labor union, work resumed uniformly this morning. Five factories including the Xiangyuan factory in the concession area went on strike this morning due to wage deductions by the factory. After persuasion by the Social Affairs Bureau, the factories have agreed to issue supplementary wages and have scheduled to resume work this morning. Workers at the Shuang Gong Silk Factory also went on strike this morning, demanding a wage increase. Details are noted below:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Resumption of Work in Zhabei <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Nineteen factories in the Zhabei district, including Yuanfengyong, Meifeng, and Fuyuan on Hengfeng Road; Wuxing on Meiyuan Road; Hongchun and Jiatai on Guangfu Road; Jiyu on Gonghe Road; Yuanji and Yuanxing on Yutong Road; and Baotai, Hongsheng, Xiexin, Yuanxin, Chuxin, Maofeng, Qianyuan, Shengtai, Zhenxing, and Jiyu Xiexin on Changan Road, were incited to strike due to Sunday bonuses and wage issues the day before yesterday. The Jiyu workers initiated the strike, which then spread to other factories, totaling 19. The fourth district and second sub-district of the Public Security Bureau was informed, and immediately dispatched police to maintain order. Wu Suzhen, the director of the sixth district silk reeling union, explained the situation to the workers, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent Zhu Jintao to the Public Security Bureau to persuade the workers. It was decided to handle the matter in accordance with the mediation records signed a few days ago. As a result, all the female workers in the 19 factories resumed work this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Spreading to the Concession <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Five factories in the concession area, including Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, Yuyuan Yuji on Guoqing Road, and Yuanhe Taixin Jingwei on Alabaishi Road, implemented the wage restoration method determined by the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation decision, effective from June. However, the factories violated the decision, and the June wages were still issued at 45 cents. As a result, the Taixin workers initiated the strike, which then spread to the four factories of Yuyuan Yuji, Xiangyuan Jingwei, and Yuanhe. Fortunately, Yihe on North Chengdu Road and Xinchang in Caojiadu were not affected due to their distance. After the Social Affairs Bureau reported, Zhu Jintao was dispatched to persuade them and negotiate with the factory owners. At the same time, Yang Shumei, the director of the third district silk reeling union, explained the situation to the workers separately.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Supplementary Wages <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>After the workers in the concession area silk factories went on strike, they convened a meeting at the office of the Concession Silk Factory Association at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss solutions. Jin Yusong of Xiangyuan, Wu Shengsan of Yuanhe, and Qiu Zhongchun of Yuyuan attended. Yang Shumei, the director of the third district silk reeling union, was also present. It was decided that factories that had already issued 45 cents would issue supplementary wages from the 16th of this month, in accordance with the mediation records of the Social Affairs Bureau's Mediation Committee. In the afternoon, the labor union persuaded the workers again, and the workers agreed to resume work at the factories this morning. In addition, the silk factories in the Zhabei district sent a letter to the Silk Factory Association yesterday, inquiring about the method of issuing wages to female workers in June. The Silk Factory Association replied that it should be implemented from June in accordance with the mediation decision.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Shuang Gong Strike <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>More than 400 workers at the Fulun Heng Shuang Gong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road in Hongkou went on strike because the single palace factories in the Hongkou and Zhabei districts increased wages this time, while the Shuang Gong factory did not follow suit. This morning, when the factory opened, only two-tenths of the workers went to work, while the rest went on strike and sent representatives to the factory comprador, Shen Zubei, to demand that wages be issued in accordance with the wage distribution of the single palace factories as mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau this time. However, the factory manager said that according to past practice, the wages of the double palace were calculated at 80% of the single palace price. After the January 28th Incident, only Fulun was operating in the city. In order to take care of the interests of both parties, it was changed to 42 cents. Later, as the single palace factories gradually resumed operations, and in view of the sluggish silk market, the result of the meeting was that the wages were uniformly 42 cents. At that time, the double palace factory did not discount the price. Later, the single palace factory increased wages to 45 cents, and the double palace factory increased by one cent. The difference was minimal at this time, but the workers did not understand and demanded a wage increase. Therefore, the factory rejected the workers' demands. According to the factory manager Shen Zubei, who spoke to a reporter from New Sound News, the raw materials for the double palace are supplied by the single palace factory, so there are no benefits to be gained. Given the economic depression in society, if the factory were to close, no one would rent the factory site. At the same time, the factory takes into consideration the employees and workers, who would not have enough food and clothing if they lost their jobs. For this reason, the factory is doing its best to maintain operations, but it is often difficult to make ends meet. The workers are so unappreciative. In this situation, the factory has no choice but to close down and apologize to the workers.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Naming Ceremony of the Tianchu Aircraft, Aviation School Sends Aircraft to Participate in Performance <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Aviation School Principal Mao Bangchu Sends Two Aircraft to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Significance of Choosing Hongqiao Airport as the Naming Location</p>
<p>It Is Possible to Commemorate the Relics of the Shanghai War and the Tomb of Short</p>
<p>Wu Yun Chu, the owner of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, donated combat aircraft. The Junkers-style Tianchu aircraft has been assembled and is scheduled to hold a naming ceremony at Hongqiao Airport at 3:00 PM on the 16th. At that time, two Junkers-style aircraft from the Hangzhou Aviation School will come to Shanghai to perform technical demonstrations with the aircraft. The preparations are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Preparing the Ceremony <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Aviation Association, together with the Tianchu Factory, negotiated the location for the naming ceremony and decided to hold it at Hongqiao Airport. From yesterday, the Tianchu Factory has been rushing to build colorful tents inside and outside the airport, and building a rostrum to prepare for the ceremony. They are also rushing to print order forms and admission tickets, which will be printed today and distributed to all sectors of society to invite them to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Government Agency <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<p>The Tianchu aircraft was originally intended to be named in Jiangwan Racecourse, following the example of the Shanghai No. 1 aircraft naming ceremony. However, after consultation with the Aviation Administration and the Aviation Association, it was believed that Jiangwan Racecourse was not suitable for multiple aircraft to take off and land. At the same time, Hongqiao Airport was severely bombed by Japanese aircraft during the January 28th Incident, and there is also the tomb of the American righteous man Short, who helped us resist Japan. Usually, due to military relations, it is not open to the public. It is better to take this opportunity to allow people from all walks of life to enter and visit freely. In addition to watching the naming and performance of the Tianchu aircraft, they can also commemorate the bombed relics and the tomb of the American righteous man Short. Therefore, it was finally decided to hold the ceremony at Hongqiao Airport.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Venue Layout <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Hongqiao Airport originally did not have stands and seating facilities. The Preparatory Office specially built them at the airport. Those holding tickets can enter the venue through the cordon. Those with invitations from the Aviation Association and Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory can enter the special seats with their invitations. In addition, because the weather is hot, Guanshengyuan will sell cold drinks at the venue. Also, because the airport is far from the downtown area, although there are public buses back and forth, the number of buses is too small. There will definitely be many people attending on that day. A letter has been sent to the Public Works Bureau to inform the public bus company in the area to increase the number of buses or add special buses to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Naming Sequence <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

<p>Tianchu and the Aviation Association telegraphed the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Aviation Administration yesterday, requesting that they send personnel to Shanghai to attend the naming ceremony of the Tianchu aircraft, and requested the Aviation Administration to send personnel to receive it. After the aircraft is named, it will be assigned to the Air Force.</p>

<p>Mao Bangchu, the principal of the Aviation School, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou a few days ago. After negotiation with the Tianchu Factory and the Aviation Association, they decided to send a pilot to Shanghai to fly the aircraft for performance. Principal Mao has already telegraphed the school in Hangzhou to send personnel to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive today. At the same time, Mao has also decided to send two Junkers aircraft of the same type as the Tianchu aircraft to Shanghai. At that time, they will perform simultaneously in the air with the Tianchu aircraft, forming a small squadron (the Air Force has three aircraft in a squadron) for a practical exercise of aerial combat.</p>

<p>The Aviation Association printed 200,000 slogans, which will be distributed by aircraft in the city on the 15th and at the venue on the 16th. The content is as follows: 1. We must help the government expand the air force to fulfill our duty; 2. Expanding the air force is for the self-defense of our nation; 3. If we want to save the country, save the nation, and save ourselves, we must donate to the Aviation Patriotic Fund; 4. Helping the government expand the air force and build air defense is protecting the country and safeguarding the people; 5. The Tianchu aircraft is a representative of the people assisting the government in building air defense; 6. The air force cannot be built up in a short time. We must continue to work hard to achieve our goals; 7. The Tianchu aircraft was indirectly purchased with funds from compatriots who love domestic products and often eat monosodium glutamate.</p>

<p>In addition, four kinds of flyers, 100,000 copies each, will be distributed at the same time: 1. Dear citizens, we held the naming ceremony of the Shanghai No. 1 aircraft last month, and now we continue to hold the naming ceremony of the Tianchu aircraft, which is precisely to show our association's continuous efforts to build the air force. We hope that the citizens will continue to support us with enthusiasm and provide continuous funding so that the air defense that guarantees the survival of the nation can be gradually strengthened; 2. Dear citizens, our national crisis is deep and serious, and it is not enough to save us without sufficient time to prepare calmly. Therefore, our association is working hard to actively expand the air force and contribute to the government. We hope that the citizens will not be麻醉ed by temporary safety and will actively participate in our association and fight together to save the country, save the nation, and save themselves; 3. Dear citizens, during the January 28th Incident last year, our city suffered extremely severe bombing by enemy aircraft, and suffered great losses. We have learned from the pain and only need to hurry up and build our air force to strengthen our air defense; 4. Dear citizens, modern warfare is scientific warfare. If you want to resist the enemy and protect the country and safeguard the people, you must strengthen the most powerful and effective war tool, the air force. Now the enemy is likely to seriously oppress us at any time, so we must hurry up and strengthen the air force. We hope that everyone will stand up and work hard.</p>

<p>Determined to Resist Japan, Willing to Die to Repay the Country</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang recently sent a Geng telegram to Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan: (Above omitted) I am determined to resist Japan and I am prepared to die. However, I believe that I will have a clearer conscience under the banner of resisting Japan. Wen Tianxiang's poem says, "Since ancient times, who has lived without dying? Leave a loyal heart to shine in history." Every time I read these words, I am inspired. (Below omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Founding of the Jilin Volunteer Army Federation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a report from the Jilin Province Volunteer Army Federation stating that after Su, Ma, Li, and Wang were forced to leave the country, all their subordinates remained hidden and ready to move. In addition, the small volunteer armies in various places coordinated with each other and repeatedly made meritorious contributions. Wherever their banners pointed, the Japanese were terrified. Among the lost provinces of Northeast China, there is still a ray of light, and that is the volunteer army that still exists. However, due to strong oppression, disrupted communications, distant mountains and rivers, and difficult journeys, it has been difficult to receive domestic assistance. Although representatives of various departments have appealed, assistance is still difficult to give and receive. Now, the volunteer armies of various departments have united to organize an agency to receive assistance from all parties. This is the reason for the organization of this association. The Northeast Volunteer Army has fought thousands of miles, bathed in blood for more than a year, without food or ammunition, but they still raise their arms and shout, and fight hard against the invaders. Wherever righteousness lies, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Regardless of the success or failure of their efforts, their sincere heart is commendable. If they receive sufficient assistance, they will be able to maneuver between the White Mountains and the Black Waters. How can the people of the whole country sit idly by? Recovering sovereignty and recovering lost territory is a shared responsibility, and there is no distinction between Qin and Yue. The purpose of the organization of this association is purely to receive assistance from all parties, and it does not contain any political or ideological activities, nor does it expand propaganda or sensationalize rumors. It only wants to receive assistance so that the Northeast Volunteer Army can extend its life and resistance. The Support Association is the active agency for assisting the Volunteer Army, and it has the obligation to support and assist this association. Therefore, we hereby request that you provide economic or material assistance. A declaration is attached, which mainly says that they will resist the enemy's artillery fire with their flesh and blood, and would rather be patriotic ghosts than slaves of a lost country. This ambition and this heart are pitiful and worthy of sympathy. It also describes that although the leaders Ma and Li have left the country, their subordinates still exist. Chen Zongdai, in the name of the Fourth Route Commander, took over as the commander of the Allied Forces, accommodated the remaining troops, and launched repeated counterattacks, breaking Mishan, capturing Fujin, and encircling Yilan. The facts are all there, and the merits are obvious. However, according to the person in charge of the Support Association, the association's donations to the Jilin Volunteer Army are all distributed and handled by the Jilin Volunteer Army Headquarters. Now that this document has been received, the organization members of the federation are being investigated.</p>

<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the customs authorities have agreed to the request of Chinese and foreign merchants and issued a notice that goods subject to tax that are withdrawn within three months from the date of implementation of the new tax on May 22 this year will still be taxed according to the old tax regulations promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Those who have already paid according to the new tax regulations can apply for a refund of the overpaid tax. According to the original customs regulations, this type of goods would be taxed according to the new tax regulations from the date of implementation of the new tax. Subsequently, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other groups protested one after another. The authorities, taking into account the difficulties of the merchants, agreed to extend the grace period by three months.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Telephone Bureau Decides to Automatically Cancel Chinese-Foreign Call Fee <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Consults Municipal Government for Assistance</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is a call fee of five cents for each Chinese rental telephone call. This fee is not only cumbersome but also very inconvenient for users. In order to facilitate Chinese rental telephone users, the Ministry of Communications specially ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to consult with the Shanghai Telephone Company to cancel this call fee. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company said that there are tens of thousands of users in the concession and only thousands of Chinese telephone users in the Chinese area. If this call fee is cancelled, Chinese rental telephone calls will inevitably increase, and all the switchboards will not be sufficient. Therefore, they refused to cancel the fee. Although the Shanghai Telephone Bureau negotiated with the company several times, there was still no result. Now, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau believes that the Shanghai Telephone Company has no sincerity in cooperation, and the bureau has decided to take the initiative to cancel the fee to benefit users within the Chinese district. Once a reply is received, they will immediately start the process. The Ministry of Communications has also consulted the Municipal Government to instruct the Public Utilities Bureau to assist the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in carrying out the negotiations in order to realize the cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Urging Expedited Repair of the North Stone Cave Embankment <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yan Fenglou and others submitted to Chairman Gu, stating: Respectfully to Gu Jun, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it is regarding the 125 zhang of the North Stone Cave Wild Goose Wing North Head Embankment in the Fifth District of Baoshan County. In September and October of last year, we telegraphed requesting the dispatch of personnel for surveying and estimating, and the allocation of funds for repair. We received Approval No. 1928 from your office, stating that the Construction Department had been instructed to handle the matter. Furthermore, we examined the Shen Xin and other newspapers dated October 29th, which recorded that the Baoshan North Stone Cave Wild Goose Wing North Head perilous construction expense was decided by your office in a meeting on the 28th, to be the responsibility of the Construction Department to order relevant counties to recognize and raise funds. Fenglou and others were deeply gratified upon receiving this good news. However, the project is extensive and requires significant funds. It may not be easy for the counties to raise the funds on time. Moreover, in late March, strong winds have been blowing continuously, causing severe damage and creating perilous situations, with the risk of collapse at any moment. Therefore, in April, on an auspicious day, we telegraphed your office again, requesting the swift allocation of funds for early repairs to avoid accidents. Subsequently, we received notification from the county government, relaying your instruction that the project would still await the determination of the funding method by the counties before comprehensive planning and repairs could be undertaken. We respectfully observe that this section of the embankment is adjacent to North Stone Cave and is located in a crucial area. During northeast winds, the water currents are even more turbulent. As with the repairs that were hastily carried out twenty years ago, the sparse reeds were washed away by the huge waves. Continuing the repairs last year, recent rains have caused the burlap sacks to rot, the soil to collapse, and the embankment surface to crumble, making it precarious. If urgent repairs are not undertaken, the autumn floods and high tides will soon arrive, making it impossible to defend against them. Fenglou and others have witnessed this situation and are extremely alarmed. Therefore, we are making our fifth appeal, humbly beseeching your office to promptly instruct the Construction Department to dispatch personnel for surveying and estimation, and at the same time, instruct the Finance Department to use the counties' old debts and urgent grain transport levies to raise significant funds from the banking sector within a set timeframe for completion. Otherwise, not only will the entire county's population be buried in the fishes' bellies, but the fields, houses, and lives of people in nearby counties will also be affected. The local people have fulfilled their tax obligations and should have the right to protection of life and property. We are telegraphing again with utmost urgency, imploring you to approve and implement this promptly. We await your instructions with utmost anxiety. Respectfully submitted by Yan Fenglou, Township Head of Huiyuan Township in the Fifth District of Baoshan County, Li Fengming, Deputy Township Head, and all the Township Residents.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Machine Federation Requests Exemption from Double Taxation on Silk and Cotton Interwoven Fabrics <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Federation submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, stating: Regarding cotton and silk interwoven fabrics, customs duties are duplicated, and domestically produced cloths are unable to bear the burden. We are submitting this request for exemption based on the distressed situation of Suzhou merchants. The Sanxin, Mingxin, and other dyeing and weaving factories have informed the federation that, with the exception of pure cotton yarn woven products, for which the cotton yarn tax payment certificate can be used to offset the export certificate, cotton and rayon interwoven fabrics cannot be used to offset and must still be assessed and pay a 7.5% export tariff. Those without a label must be assessed and charged 12.5%. If transported to non-unified tax areas, another export tax must be levied. Moreover, the rayon portion included in the interwoven fabrics has already paid a high luxury import tax of 80%. In addition, there are various harsh taxes and levies in the provinces, such as the landing tax in Sichuan and the production and sales tax in Jiangxi (i.e., bandit suppression and rehabilitation donation). Investigations reveal that the amount of rayon in interwoven fabrics only accounts for 1% to 20% of the total weight, never exceeding 20%, while cotton yarn that has already paid the unified tax accounts for 80% to 99%. However, the customs duty burden is as mentioned above, a duplication. On the other hand, foreign goods imported into our country, whether they are pure cotton woven products, or interwoven fabrics of cotton and wool, cotton and silk, or cotton, hemp, wool, and silk, only pay one import tax, and when re-exported, they can be transported without hindrance with a pass and are exempt from double taxation. The preferential treatment is such that our domestic goods, when transported and sold within the country, face difficulties and setbacks. The disparity is obvious, and the unfairness is extreme. We investigate that foreign goods are able to dump in our country's market, implementing its economic aggression, because of the inequality of our country's tariff and armed with its strong capital, excellent technology, catering to the consumer's psychology, strangling our fate. If we do not rise up to protect and promote, how can our machine-made domestic woven fabrics of interwoven cotton survive and compete with foreign goods? Inevitably, they will follow in the footsteps of native cloth, being defeated one by one. The federation, in view of the precariousness of domestic industry, is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the cotton weaving industry is particularly severe. We humbly request the government to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, adhere to the principle of one item, one tax, protect domestic goods, encourage domestic production, immediately exempt interwoven fabrics from re-export tax, increase the import tax on rayon and various woven fabrics, in order to counter and seek survival. It is a vital move to revitalize our country's industry. Therefore, we are submitting this request based on the facts, humbly requesting your ministry to review and approve the request, (transfer to the Ministry of Finance) order the customs to exempt, in order to relieve the difficulties of Suzhou merchants and benefit domestic goods. We await your instructions with utmost anxiety. Respectfully submitted to the National Government Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry (Approved by the Ministry of Industry and transferred to the Ministry of Finance for review).</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways yesterday instructed the preparation of schedules for the operation of scheduled freight trains between Shanghai and Peiping and Shanghai and Tongguan, stating: In compliance with the matter, it is noted that the resolution of the Capital Ferry Preparatory Committee included two proposals: the opening of through traffic between Shanghai and Peiping after the ferry is completed and the operation of scheduled freight trains, both of which are extremely important in terms of passenger and freight revenue. In addition to the opening and arrival times of through traffic between Shanghai and Peiping at major stations, which have already been stipulated, these scheduled freight trains should be temporarily divided into two lines: one from Shanghai to Peiping and one from Shanghai to Tongguan, with one train departing and returning each day. The through traffic schedule should be based on the principles of speed and accuracy. As the ferry is about to open, these schedules should be prepared as soon as possible for concurrent review and implementation. Therefore, the bureau is instructed to comply with the matter, promptly consult and prepare a report for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Serious Labor Dispute at Electric Company, Labor Side Presented Four Demands Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng to Mediate Today</p>
<p>Appeals Committee Issues Appeal to All Sectors</p>
<p>Workers at the Yangshupu New Factory of the Shanghai Electric Company recently had a dispute over the demand for severance pay for foreman Yang Aqiao, and the company further dismissed union directors Ni Wenfu, Chen Baogen, Pan Genlin, etc., on the 5th of this month, leading to a sudden escalation of the labor dispute. After the union convened a meeting of old and new factory foremen, it was resolved to present four proposals for improving treatment to the company and demand the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. If there is no result, a full-force confrontation will be determined. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a Chinese director, will visit company Vice President Heert this afternoon to mediate. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Letter to the General Manager <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Water and Electricity Union of the Fourth District yesterday presented four treatment proposals and requested the reinstatement of dismissed workers, in a letter to the company's general manager, stating: Esteemed General Manager, With utmost respect, Your company dismissed Ni Wenfu, Chen Baogen, Pan Genlin, Zhang Caisheng, and others on the 7th of this month without any reason. All the workers and foremen of the two factories were deeply surprised upon hearing this. An investigation reveals that Ni Wenfu and the other four individuals are of upright character and diligent in their work. It seems unnecessary to dismiss them. Moreover, when the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department was transferred to your company in April 1929, Mr. Mou Fei, the Shanghai representative of the American and Foreign Company, solemnly declared that the jobs of workers would be protected, as secure as they were under the Shanghai Municipal Council. Even in the middle of last year, you, sir, repeatedly declared to the workers that they would not be dismissed without reason. The words are still ringing in our ears. We believe that you, sir, will certainly not forget them. However, now you are doing the opposite. We believe that this measure is extremely inappropriate. Now, the workers and foremen of both factories are uneasy about this situation. After repeated meetings, we believe that if Ni Wenfu and the other four cannot be reinstated, then all the workers and foremen will not be able to work with peace of mind, and a state of terror will be created. Therefore, we are taking the liberty of submitting this letter of request, immediately withdrawing the dismissal order to calm the public, and attaching four proposals for improving worker treatment. We sincerely hope that you will review and implement them. It would be our greatest fortune. We have scheduled Liu Linsheng, Wang Xingen, Yang Zhaogen, Zhang Lianhai, and others to pay you a visit on the 13th of this month. We hope that you will grant us an audience at that time and reply as soon as possible. With utmost impatience, we await your instructions. Respectfully submitted by all the workers and foremen of the two factories of the Shanghai Electric Company.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Four Conditions <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The detailed contents of the four proposals for improving worker treatment are as follows: (1) Pension and Severance Pay: When workers retire, the company should pay a 5% pension. If workers are laid off due to a factory slowdown, in addition to the above pension, they should be given severance pay equal to three months' wages. The aforementioned pension is compensation for the workers' years of hard work and is not a large amount at 5%. As for the severance pay, due to the current economic downturn and the large number of unemployed people, it is difficult to find work once retired. Therefore, we ask the company to sympathize with the workers' hard work and distress and issue additional severance pay to avoid affecting their livelihood. (2) Sick Leave and Medical Expenses: Workers' wages during sick leave should be paid at the original rate. If patients are hospitalized for treatment, all expenses should be borne by the company. Workers' monthly wages are very meager, barely enough to make a living, with no savings. Shorting one day's wages is shorting one day's food. Therefore, wages during sick leave should be paid as usual, and hospital expenses should also be borne to avoid increasing the workers' burden due to illness. (3) Compensation for Injuries and Deaths: Workers who die or become disabled due to work should be compensated generously. The compensation method is as follows: For those who have adult children, compensation of 2,000 yuan. If the children are young, compensation should be given according to the Zhou Genfa case. If there are many young children, the amount of compensation should be increased proportionally based on the Zhou Genfa case. If disabled due to work, the original salary should be paid until old age. (4) Annual Bonus: All those who have worked in the factory for one full year should be given an annual bonus equal to one month's wages at the end of each year as a reward. This annual bonus has been referenced to the treatment of workers in various factories, and it is generally the case, not an excessive request.</p>

<p>Since the escalation of the dispute, the Shanghai General Labor Union, in order to seek a swift resolution, dispatched Executive Committee member Shao Xubai yesterday morning, accompanied by union representatives Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Yang Zhaogen, Zhang Caisheng, and others, to meet with Chinese director Yuan Ludeng at No. 1 Bund, Avenue Edward VII, to request him to mediate. Mr. Yuan expressed his willingness to be responsible for mediating and hoped that the workers would wait patiently for a solution. It is reported that Mr. Yuan has scheduled to visit Heert at the company's headquarters on Sazhi Road at 2:00 PM today to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Appeal to All Sectors <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The union's appeals committee issued an appeal to all sectors yesterday, stating: Fellow countrymen of all sectors across the country, public concession water and electricity users, in the present scientific age, production relies on machinery and electricity, which is the driving force of social production and an indispensable thing for the city. In the past, the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department was sold for 85 million taels to the Shanghai Electric Company. In order to protect the interests of users and Chinese employees, the Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated with the company that accepted the Electricity Department that electricity prices should not be increased arbitrarily, employees should not be laid off arbitrarily, and efforts should be made to develop the electricity business forward, complete a complete electrical construction, reduce electricity prices, improve employee treatment, and effectively protect the existing treatment of employees, and deposit one million taels in the current company as the Shanghai Municipal Council's employee pension. Now, the Shanghai Electric Company, for the sake of profit, relying on the power of imperialism, violates the articles of association, and with the qualification of a monopoly business in the public concession, arbitrarily raises prices. It has increased electricity prices twice in less than four years. It treats our employees by dismissing them in large numbers, swallowing pensions, using low-paid new workers, dismissing old workers, destroying worker organizations, dismissing union directors without reason, deducting pensions on false pretenses, and is unwilling to accept the mediation of our country's government agencies. Fellow countrymen, the imperialists are so fierce. For their own interests, our two thousand employees have no choice but to fight against the imperialist capitalists. For the interests of the entire nation, they have no choice but to resist the imperialists. They are still in a state of mutual hostility. We hope that all sectors will speak out for justice and provide sympathetic assistance. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>National hero General Ma Zhanshan received a warm welcome from all sectors upon returning home from overseas. General Ma paid close attention to the local industries and factories and agreed with Mr. Hu Xiyuan, director and general manager of the China Apure Electric Appliance Factory, to visit the factory yesterday. In the afternoon, Hu Xiyuan went to the General's residence in the French Concession to welcome him. General Ma then accompanied Du Chongyuan, with a light vehicle and simple entourage, and Hu together to the factory. There, assistant manager Feng Jiacheng and general affairs section chief Li Xinfang jointly received them. After a brief rest in the reception room, Hu Xiyuan and others accompanied them on a tour of the various groups of the glass bulb department. The general nodded frequently, expressing his approval, and personally inscribed "Magnify and Enlarge the Light" to encourage them. Due to other engagements, he did not have time to visit the factory's electric motor department for manufacturing fans. Tea and refreshments were then served, photos were taken, and they returned.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the stoppage of the dispute at the Dazhong Rubber Factory on Xinjia Slope Road, Shanghai West, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to resolve it. All workers were allowed to be dismissed, and the factory paid each person a severance pay of 20 yuan, half of which was paid first. The remainder would be paid after two months if work had not resumed, or if work resumed, it would be waived. However, the workers demanded a one-time payment, which the employers did not agree to. Therefore, when the employers distributed the payment at the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, the workers were unwilling to receive it. Fortunately, after explanation by the Social Affairs Bureau mediation director Wang Xianqing and persuasion by the Jin section chief of the third section of the first district of the Public Security Bureau, they dispersed. At 1:00 PM yesterday, they returned to Yaowang Temple in the Nanshi area, where the employers paid half of the amount, 10 yuan per person, in accordance with the mediation record. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Li Guilin to supervise, and the Public Security Bureau sent police to protect. As a result, the workers all received the payment. A total of 116 people were paid. Those who have not received the payment will continue to be paid at the factory starting today.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Social Affairs Bureau Orders Insurance Industry to List Insurance Documents in Both Chinese and Foreign Languages <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after the proposal of the Shoe Leather Nail Industry Association and others at the Fourth Member Representative Assembly that insurance documents should uniformly abolish foreign languages and use Chinese, resolved to amend and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. Now, the approval states: Received and acknowledged. This case was previously submitted by this bureau to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions and interpretation. International practice stipulates that the language to be used in commercial contracts has no fixed rules and should be determined according to commercial customs in various regions. As for foreign insurance companies, on the grounds of business relations, even if there are places where foreign languages need to be used on the documents, at least Chinese and foreign languages must be listed in parallel to prevent merchants from being deceived and to achieve the purpose of regaining sovereignty. As for insurance companies and policyholders that are both Chinese, they should respect the national system and facilitate the majority of policyholders. Even if market customs or other factors require the use of foreign languages, both Chinese and foreign languages must be listed in parallel, with Chinese as the main language. This bureau has ordered the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association to comply with these requirements. In view of the above, in addition to ordering the Insurance Association to correct this as soon as possible, you are hereby notified of this approval.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Inspection of Weights and Measures in the French Concession <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting August 1st</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new weights and measures system by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, it has made unremitting efforts. The Chinese area has already been inspected twice, and all industries have complied. As for the French Concession, the bureau conducted the first inspection jointly with the French Municipal Council on December 14, 1931. At that time, many industries had already complied. On January 19, 1932, a second inspection was conducted, but it was interrupted due to the Shanghai War. It is now learned that the bureau has scheduled to conduct a second inspection starting on August 1st. All procedures have been prepared, and the French Municipal Council has also sent a letter to notify in order to dispatch personnel to assist at that time. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was also instructed to notify all industries in the French Concession to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e151">International Trade Bureau Releases the Current Commercial Situation of Overseas Chinese in Fiji <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Operating in Rice, Sugar, Ramie, Coconut, and Timber as the Basis</p>
<p>All Industries Are Depressed Due to the Impact of the Economic Downturn</p>
<p>The Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry yesterday released the current business situation of overseas Chinese native product merchants in Fiji. The original text reads: Fiji's native products mainly include rice, sugar, ramie, coconut, tobacco, and timber. Most of the overseas Chinese engaged in business here use these native products as the basis. In recent years, they have been severely depressed due to the impact of the economic downturn, and the situation last year was even worse than before. The general situation of the overseas Chinese native product merchants in the past year is described below:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Rice Market Stable <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese control 80% of Fiji's rice industry, with strong power. During the heyday, they had the power to control the market. Today, however, times have changed greatly. In recent years, native products have fallen in price, and the Fijian economy has experienced panic. As a result, many people have improved maize and the like, and rice sales have been greatly affected. The value of those exported overseas is only more than 30,000 Fijian dollars, which is almost twice as different from the 80,000 Fijian dollars of the previous year. Fortunately, the market price was still stable last year (about 5 Fijian dollars per bag), and the overseas Chinese rice merchants suffered few losses.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Sugar Industry Depressed <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In the past, overseas Chinese had a considerable part of the sugar industry in Fiji. In the past six or seven years, large-scale sugar factories established by Europeans, Americans, and Fijians have been established in many places, with new manufacturing methods and excellent product quality. Chinese merchants have been greatly affected. It is found that most of Fiji's sugar production is sold to the United States. Last year, 13 million dans of the total Fiji sugar production of about 14 million dans were sold to the United States. The Chinese merchants are engaged in domestic trade in Fiji and have no exports. In this time of economic panic, the Fijians' purchasing power has decreased, and the operation has been quite depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ramie Production Reduced <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The quantity of Fiji ramie production used to increase year by year. In recent years, the price has fallen more and more, and farmers have found it unprofitable to plant, and production has gradually decreased. Last year, the best overseas market for ramie was Japan. Therefore, except for Japanese ramie merchants in Fiji who obtained considerable profits, the rest were unprofitable. Many overseas Chinese engaged in this industry have abandoned it due to losses in recent years. It will become more and more reduced in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Coconut Merchants Suffer Losses <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Last year, overseas Chinese coconut profits were unprofitable, as in the previous year. The reason is that the industry cannot cooperate. When they buy copra from farmers, they mutually increase the purchase price. The cost is already high, and they cannot wait for a good price to sell. As a result, some even suffered losses. The way to remedy this is to strive for cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Timber Declines <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese timber merchants in Fiji used to make a lot of profit, but now the golden age has passed, and they have even suffered losses. Last year's situation was the most declining in the past ten years. The reasons for the decline of the timber industry are nothing more than business competition, oversupply, and price decline. In the past six or seven years, the number of overseas Chinese timber yards has increased by more than 80 (now there are about 800 in total). Three years ago, when sales were broad, supply and demand were met, and business was booming, the profits were good. Today, however, foreign trade is almost cut off, and on the island itself, due to economic panic, construction has decreased, and sales are not as good as before. The most important remedy is to reduce production and meet supply and demand. There will be no competition, and prices will naturally rise.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Heavy Tobacco Tax Increase <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Last year, operators in Fiji, whether foreign or Chinese merchants, were unprofitable. The reason is that exports of tobacco leaves have decreased. The Fiji government's heavy tobacco leaf tax is also an obstacle to development. The remedies are to expand the export tobacco leaf market and the Fiji government to increase the foreign cigarette population tax.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Sichuan Merchant Guild Urges Relief for Refugees in Northern Sichuan <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Merchant Guild, deeply concerned about the plight of tens of thousands of people in Northern Sichuan who have been displaced by war and banditry, rendered homeless and starving, has sent a letter to the Shanghai Jisheng Society, earnestly requesting the allocation of funds for relief efforts. The letter states: "Respected Sirs, our province's Northern Sichuan, including Baoning and the Jianzhong counties, has always been known for its poverty and hardship. In recent years, drought and the exploitation by stationed troops have made life unbearable for the people. However, due to its remote location, poor transportation, and a lack of talented individuals to handle affairs, the region has been unable to appeal for help from the outside world. As a result, the extreme suffering endured by the people, akin to living in hell, is little known to outsiders. This time, taking advantage of the internal conflicts among Sichuan warlords, the Red Bandits fled from Shaanxi into Sichuan. When they initially occupied counties such as Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, many refugees sought shelter within the city walls, placing an additional burden on the already strained local resources. After the exploitation by the stationed troops, the Red Bandits further extorted donations from the people under the pretext of suppressing banditry. Pitiful residents, already struggling to survive, were unable to cope. Consequently, some abandoned their fields and houses, fleeing in secret, while others resorted to suicide. Such tragic scenes are numerous. With no strength to suppress the bandits, the stationed troops retreated from the city of Lu in June 20, they even arbitrarily robbed the people, looting the city inside and out, leaving it completely empty. The people had long heard of the Red Bandits' cruel massacres wherever they went, and everyone was terrified. Therefore, when the retreating troops engaged in robbery, the people mistakenly believed that the Red Bandits were attacking. Consequently, both the young, the old, and those already displaced, only knew to flee for their lives, disregarding everything else. They fled together.</p>
<p>Coinciding with a major rise in the river water levels, the retreating troops had already seized the boats. In addition to the more than three thousand people who drowned while scrambling to cross the river, it is estimated that approximately fifty to sixty thousand men, women, and children fled to Shunqing, while another forty to fifty thousand fled to Tongchuan and Mianzhou. To this day, they live in makeshift shelters, without any assistance. Sichuan warlords are preoccupied with their internal power struggles and pay no attention to the refugees. Moreover, they suspect that the refugees are intermingled with Red Bandits and have prohibited them from traveling elsewhere, leaving them with no way out, without clothing or food. Without urgent assistance, they can only await their doom. This is the situation for those who managed to reach the towns and cities; countless others fled in disarray, lost their way, and wandered on the roads. Their dire circumstances defy description. Letters are pouring in from all directions, requesting us to appeal to charitable organizations and philanthropists in Shanghai to raise funds and remit them to Chongqing as quickly as possible, so that relief efforts can be carried out on the front lines. They emphasize that the sooner, the better, as any delay may be too late. Our guild, aware of the difficult times and the widespread disasters across the provinces, understands the limitations of your society's resources. However, aside from your esteemed society, to whom can we appeal? Furthermore, after investigation, we confirm that the situation in Jianzhong and other counties is indeed severe, mainly due to their remote location, poor transportation, and lack of outside awareness. We respectfully request that your esteemed society display great compassion and generously provide relief. Not only will the dying refugees be blessed, but the members of our guild will also be deeply grateful. We humbly submit this request, seeking the kind consideration of the charitable gentlemen of the Jisheng General Assembly. Respectfully submitted by the Sichuan Merchants' Public Welfare Association."</p>

<p>丨Zhou Yinglong Was Extradited from Zhenjiang to Shanghai Yesterday丨</p>
<p>Shen Mengyi, a native of Huzhou, worked in the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China and was the son of Shen Tianxin. On the morning of the 20th of last month, at 8 a.m., he left home in car number 2085. After dropping off his sister, Yiyao, at the Customs Library on Xinzha Road, as he was about to return to the car to go to the Bank of China, a group of kidnappers suddenly seized Shen and demanded a large ransom. Subsequently, thanks to the efforts of Chief Detective You A'gen of the Zhabei Police Station, Detectives Liu Junqing and Zhou Guisen, and Detective Shen Jinwen, Shen was rescued at 559 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. The ringleaders of the kidnappers, Ma Qiaosheng and Ma Rongsheng, along with twenty others, were apprehended. Three pistols and sixteen bullets were confiscated. The First Special Court has since ordered them detained for interrogation. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. Ma Qiaosheng has now confessed that Zhou Yinglong (also known as Zhou Younan), a native of Yangzhou, is also an accomplice in this case. Zhou currently serves as the manager of the Inland River Merchants Bureau in Zhenjiang. Detective You requested the First Special Court to issue an official document, instructing the detective to cooperate with the local Public Security Bureau on the 11th of this month and arrest Zhou in Room 38 of the Wuzhou Hotel at 2 Yingshan Street. Zhou was extradited to Shanghai yesterday and brought before the First Special Court's Criminal Division this morning. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the previous circumstances and requested that Zhou Yinglong be tried together with Ma Qiaosheng and the others. Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered Zhou Yinglong to be detained and tried together with Ma Qiaosheng and the others at a later date.</p>

<p>Already Telegraphed the Aviation Administration to Inquire About Mr. Sun's Real Name</p>
<p>Grand Welcome Will Boost Aviation and National Salvation</p>
<p>Our country's aviator, Mr. Sun Dongkang, is flying back to his homeland from Germany. He has already flown from Myanmar to Bangkok, Siam, and is about to arrive on Chinese soil. However, the news of Mr. Sun's flight was transmitted via foreign telegrams. There may be errors in the transliteration of his name in the domestic newspapers. According to Mr. Lin Wojiang, the Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, the association has not been able to determine Mr. Sun's true name due to the lack of accurate information. However, it is believed that our embassy in Germany has sent a telegram to the country reporting Mr. Sun's flight back to his homeland. Furthermore, the entry of the aircraft requires the approval of the Aviation Administration. Therefore, the Aviation Association has telegraphed the Aviation Administration to inquire about the truth. Upon receiving a reply, the Aviation Association will initiate a grand welcome led by prominent figures to honor Mr. Sun's long journey and to inspire the public's view of aviation and national salvation and encourage the emergence of aviation talents, and so on.</p>

<p>The transportation of silver dollars on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways was previously handled separately by the Dafeng (Beijing-Shanghai Line) and Tonghe (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line) transportation companies. This month, the contract with the Tonghe Company expired, and the responsibility for transporting silver dollars on both Shanghai-Hangzhou lines has been consolidated under the Dafeng Company. This has been reported to the Ministry by the Railway Bureau and approved. However, the formal contract is still being drafted and has not yet been signed. Because the Tonghe Company is announcing its closure today, the Railway Bureau, to facilitate the transport of silver dollars, has approved the Dafeng Company to take over the responsibility immediately and bear full responsibility, in addition to quickly formalizing the contract.</p>

<p>The goods stored in the Taikoo warehouses in Guangdong, which have been monitored and prohibited from unloading by the Seamen's Union, are worth a total of six to seven million yuan. Among them, the miscellaneous grains must be unloaded urgently, as a large portion has gradually become moldy due to the weather and prolonged storage. The Guangdong Grain Guild is already working to realize the removal of the goods, but the losses are already significant. Today, Taikoo telegraphed the nine guilds of Guangdong Miscellaneous Grains, Rice, Sugar, Cotton Yarn, Sugar, Flour, Bean, Raw Medicine, Customs Declaration, Firecrackers, and Seafood industries in Guangdong, saying, "Your telegram is received. Our company is very willing to extract the warehouse goods. Please notify the Guangdong office first of your respective shipments. Our company will not be responsible for any obstructions or delays. Our company is eager to resolve the goods extraction issue, but it is difficult to resolve the Yangtze River region issues in Guangdong." Taikoo also telegraphed Huang Yongxue, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Commerce, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the same telegram.</p>

<p>Taikoo Company believes that the current labor strike was provoked by the Guangdong Seamen's Union using the issue of the dismissal of the stewards on the Wusong Wheel as a pretext. The Wusong is a Yangtze River vessel and does not sail to Nanhua. Since the issue concerns the Yangtze River region, the negotiations should not take place in Guangdong. Even if both parties discuss the matter, it should not be negotiated in Guangdong. The company has already presented its views to the Shanghai General Seamen's Union, stating that it is difficult to resolve the issue in Guangdong, and that there is room for discussion if it is moved to the Shanghai General Union.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Chen Baosheng Portion of the Xin Renhe Wheel Tragedy Concludes Interrogation <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨Sentence Scheduled for the 19th丨</p>
<p>The continued trial of Chen Baosheng, the assistant comprador in the Xin Renhe steamboat murder case involving five deaths, has been previously reported. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., Judge Luo opened the court for debate. The official asked Chen Baosheng for his confession: "I only knew when I arrived at the dock." The official asked, "Where did you sign?" Chen replied, "On the ship. After it docked. I asked Wang Guanxian what had happened, and he said there were five pirates. One fell down himself, and four were pushed down by the passengers. They are dead. Then they told me to sign." At this point, Prosecutor Zhang Zi was asked to present his opinion, stating that the defendant had premeditated and incited the murder of Ma Koubao and others. The other defendants had all confessed that Chen Baosheng had told them to sign, and that he had discussed the matter with Sun Xingsheng and others beforehand, as Ye Yuanfu had explained in detail, "The gentlemen held a meeting, and Chen Baosheng was also present." Therefore, it is very clear. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Li Mo, argued that, according to the facts, Chen Baosheng had already left the ship at Xingang to attend a wedding feast at Zhang Chengkang's house, and that it was only after Xingang that they reached Lingdian Port. Chen Baosheng was no longer present. Why should Chen Baosheng share the responsibility for others trying to cover up the crime? According to common psychology, the accused often attribute the blame to those who are not present to make themselves look better. Furthermore, signing is only a passive prevention of objections, not incitement or premeditation. Even conspiracy to commit murder is far-fetched. At this point, the lawyers for the victims, Yao Jiapeng and Tian Long, etc., each requested an ancillary civil lawsuit. The family member, Madam Ma Chen, shouted loudly in the court, "Their steamboat secretly smokes opium and premeditated murder. They sought wealth and killed. Robber ships! The murderers must pay with their lives! The company should pay compensation!" The judge said, "It will be handled according to the law." He then announced the end of the debate, set the sentencing for the 19th, and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e167">French National Day Celebrated Today <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of the French Republic. The authorities of the French Concession in Shanghai, as well as officials, gentry, merchants, and scholars residing in Shanghai, will hold a grand celebration. The French Consul-General has instructed the French Municipal Council to prepare for all matters beforehand, as previously reported in this newspaper. All institutions will be closed today. The Avenue Joffre and Avenue Dubail area, all the way to the Gujiat宅 Garden, will be decorated with lanterns and colored lights along the streets. Crowds of people will stroll and throng the streets. The Chief Inspector of the French Police Department, fearing that criminals and petty thieves may mingle and cause trouble, has specifically ordered all police stations to dispatch additional Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese detectives to patrol in sections to maintain order. At 8:00 a.m. this morning, the commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, together with the French Consul-General, gathered French army and navy soldiers stationed in Shanghai at the original site of the New Bund Garden on Avenue Joffre to hold a military review ceremony. At 9:00 a.m., French Consul-General Meyrier led his colleagues and military and police officers to hold a flag-raising ceremony in front of the consulate. At noon, a celebration was held in the consulate's main hall, inviting officials, gentry, merchants, and scholars from various countries. In the evening, a garden party was held in Gujiazhai Park, featuring dancing, music, film screenings, and fireworks to entertain the guests. In addition, the Third Special District Local Court suspended the hearing of minor cases due to the police department's holiday for National Day celebrations. However, self-prosecuted criminal cases and civil cases were heard as usual.</p>

<p>The Acting Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department's work report for June states that in terms of mortality rate, the month showed generally good health. The mortality rate for foreigners was 6.73 per thousand, a decrease of 2.11 from the previous month. This was due to fewer deaths from infectious diseases, and also due to a decrease in the number of deaths of Japanese residents. The number of deaths for Chinese was 1,048, with a rate of 11.81 per thousand. As for birth statistics, there were 74 foreigners and 158 Chinese reported, an increase from the previous month.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Infectious Diseases <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The most severe disease among foreigners was gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, and dysentery. Regarding gastroenteritis, more attention should be paid to injections. The abundance of dysentery is related to the season. Among the Chinese, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and dysentery were prevalent, with tuberculosis being particularly numerous. Inoculations against cholera were performed on 56,054 people this month. Two hundred people were vaccinated at various sanitary sub-offices.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Pathological Research <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The pathological laboratory conducted 1,554 tests and manufactured over 100 liters of cholera injection serum. At the rabies treatment center, 78 people came seeking treatment, five of whom came from other cities to Shanghai for treatment. Sixty people were treated, including 19 who received prophylactic treatment and 25 who received full treatment. The remaining 16 had started but not completed their treatment, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Veterinary Report <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The average daily milk production this month was 3.68% lower than the previous month. Several samples of "A" grade milk were found to be unsatisfactory. Re-testing of a certain cattle herd one year later showed that the reaction rate increased from 64.3% to 83.4%. Three cattle died of contagious pneumonia, and nine died of other causes. Work at the slaughterhouses continued as usual. The number of pigs slaughtered was 9.1% less than the previous month, which is normal for the season.</p>

<p>Business at the vegetable markets was quite good, and they were inspected and their weights and measures were corrected at any time. The Xiaoshadu Road vegetable market is about to be completed and opened for use. Bakeries are still inspected day and night, and are generally in good condition.

<p>Special attention has been paid to fly and mosquito control. Ditches have been cleared and oiled. Mosquito larvae were found in the central district, which has not happened for many years. Therefore, the public is asked to cooperate with the Health Department. All broken bottles, broken jars, etc., that can collect water should not be discarded at will. The Gambusia fish farm on Jiaozhou Road currently has a large number of "Gambusia" fish. If private ponds need them, they can contact the Chief Sanitary Inspector (telephone 12410 extension 23) for a very low fee. The Public Works Department is also paying attention to fly control at the garbage dumps in the east and west districts. A portion of the East District shacks has been removed, and several unregistered and unsanitary shacks in the West District have been notified to relocate.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to prevent flies from contaminating food and drinks. Also, the summer sun reflects off the water and white walls, causing discomfort and even harming the eyes. Therefore, those going out are best to wear dark glasses with side mirrors to protect their eyesight. This is very important for those boating or traveling on the water.</p>

<p>Conflict Has Ended</p>
<p>Since the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office has been operated by Ding Xie this year, it has sought to double the collection amount. The city's tobacco and alcohol industries protested this as a group, and after repeated negotiations by representatives from various industry associations, the office agreed to follow the old rules. The industries were satisfied. However, the other day, Renxing on Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei and Dashengchang on Fangxie Road in Nanshi were instructed to bring their licenses to the office to pay taxes and exchange for new licenses, but the collection directors of the north and south offices detained them and demanded a donation of four yuan for a two-yuan license, almost causing a dispute. Fortunately, Teng Zhixiang and Tong Lingyun, directors of the Shanghai North Branch Office of the Tobacco Industry Association, personally went to the tax office to negotiate. Director Ding explained that it was a misunderstanding and promised to instruct the staff to handle the matter as usual and no longer harass them. The conflict then came to an end.</p>

<p>Held at the Tianchan Stage on the Evening of the 17th</p>
<p>The Pushan Villa specializes in charitable deeds such as burying the exposed, providing medical treatment, and giving medicine. It has been around for more than 20 years, relating public health, good very shallow fresh. During this summer, the weather is hot, and various seasonal epidemic hospitals are opened one after another. Whenever there is a sudden death or death on the road and others who are unable to collect and bury the body, the villa is responsible for providing coffins and burial, fulfilling its obligations to the fullest extent. This has long been known to the public. However, the villa has never had any funds, relying entirely on the generous donations of philanthropists from all walks of life to maintain its operations. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have been in decline, and fundraising has been difficult. However, the work in progress has increased rather than decreased, and the cost of labor and materials has gradually become more expensive, creating a situation of great strain. Recently, we heard that celebrities in Shanghai and comrades from the Leshan Society initiated a fundraising opera performance at the Tianchan Stage on the night of the 17th of this month. Li Hengfeng will perform "Driving Three Passes," Chen Liangyu, Wang Jinmei, and Wang E'yan will perform "Returning to the Dragon Pavilion," Wang Shurong will perform "Taking the High Deng," Qian Juyou and Wang Shuying will perform "Empty City Stratagem," Peng Guohuan will perform "Picking a Carriage," Wang Shusheng will perform "Escorting Prisoners," Yao Mulian and Yao Jicai will perform "Original Mole," Du Jimei and Wang Jizhou will perform "Beaded Curtain Village," the two ladies Lu Guifang and Lu Guifen will perform "Four Pans Mountain," Wang Detian and Fan Hengde will perform "Ascending to Heaven," You Jusun will perform "Five Elders Meeting," Yuan Ludeng and Zheng Mengxia, Jiang Bogong will perform "Double Lion Picture," Dong Dangbin will perform "Three Iron Roosters" and other masterful works. With the enthusiastic support of the Actors' Association, actors such as Zhao Ruquan and Lin Shusen will participate and specially perform the treacherous play "Wagang Village." At that time, people from all walks of life will come together to support this charity event, and it will surely be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Silver Ear Mushroom Guild Opposes Increased Tax on Silver Ear Mushrooms <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>丨A Sudden Increase of Three Times the Original Tax Rate丨</p>
<p>Wanyuan County in Sichuan has always been a place that produces silver ear mushrooms. Because it is connected to Tongba, it has been disturbed by the Red Bandits, who have already occupied the Zhuyu Pass, Liujiaba, Sanxikou, Shuanglong Temple, and other places in the county. The county magistrate, using military affairs as a pretext, invited silver ear mushroom merchants to the county government and ordered them to pay an additional ten yuan per catty. Therefore, letters of distress have been pouring in. The merchants who have already purchased the mushrooms cannot deliver them to Shanghai and are still waiting for a solution. The local guild held an emergency meeting yesterday and unanimously decided to oppose the tax increase. It urgently telegraphed Superintendent Liu of Suiding, requesting him to order the cancellation of the tax increase and not to stop until the goal is achieved. The telegram reads as follows: "Superintendent Liu of Suiding, your Excellency: We were shocked to learn from numerous letters from our colleagues that the silver ear mushroom tax in Wanyuan, in addition to the original three yuan and two jiao per catty, has recently been forced to increase by ten yuan per catty. Silver ear mushroom producing areas mostly have customers who come to purchase them. A heavy tax will inevitably discourage them, leading to rural bankruptcy. Furthermore, there is a glut of supply in Shanghai, resulting in significant losses. If the county needs military funds, it would be better to make other plans. We humbly request that your Excellency immediately order the cancellation of the tax increase to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain the local products. We also request a reply. Li Qingfan, Chairman of the Shanghai Silver Ear Mushroom Industry Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e179">Interrogation Record of Kidnapper of Wang Delin <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Wang Delin, the nine-year-old beloved son of Wang Gaosun, a Ningbo architect residing at No. 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road in the French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits who broke into his home at 5:00 AM on December 28th of last year. They hid him away and demanded a huge ransom for his release. Negotiations failed, and it wasn't until April of this year that the case was solved by the Public Concession Police. The hostage was rescued from No. 511 in the Lüehong'an Lane, Laobazi (Old Race Course). Subsequently, the kidnappers Wang Yuanwei, Zhang Xiaomao, Yao Sheng, Xiang Ma Shi, Shi Yu Shi, Xi Ma Shi, Qian Ziming, Li Xilin, Chen Guoqian, Wu Yesong, Qian Changmei, Chen Abing, Chen Qiu Shi, Chen Zhang Shi, Zhang Wang Shi, Chen Zhang Shi, Wu Xiangfeng, Shen Qian Shi, and others (mostly from Shaoxing) – eighteen men and women in total – were apprehended. Because it was discovered that they had also committed a kidnapping case in the Public Concession, they were first sent to the First Special District Court for trial. (Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment, Zhang Xiaomao to ten and a half years, and Yao Sheng to nine and a half years.) On the 22nd of last month, Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency of the French Police, along with detectives, went to the First Special Court to transfer Wang and the other criminals to the French Police Station. The following morning, they were sent to the Third Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Later, it was found that twelve of the men and women from Qian Ziming downwards were not involved in the case. No public prosecution was initiated, and the court was asked to rule for their release and return them to the First Special Court for disposal. The police investigation of Wang Yuanwei and the other six male and female criminals has now concluded. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent back to the court for questioning. (The fourth defendant, Xiang Ma Shi, was not sent to court because she was in the final month of her pregnancy and was sent to Guangci Hospital for childbirth.) Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by clerk Wang Baoxun, ascended to the Criminal Court No. 1 for interrogation. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case and the police investigation process. He stated that the case was initiated by Zhang Genfu, who is still at large. He ordered Wang Yuanwei to gather a gang to carry out the plan and discussed it with Ying Weishui, who is also at large, who agreed to be responsible for all expenses. After the agreement, Wang gathered the second and third defendants to carry out the plan together. In advance, they obtained two pistols from the hall for backup and rented No. 1 Xinyi Lane, Xujiahui Road, as the place to hide the hostage. On the morning of December 28th at 5:00 AM, Wang gave one of the pistols to the second defendant, Zhang Xiaomao, and ordered him and the third defendant, Yao Sheng, to wait at the entrance of Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road. He then rented a car from the Zhongxi Motor Company on Caishi Road. He rode to the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Gao Naiyi Road, told the car to stop, got out and went to Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road, to meet Zhang and Yao. The two men then held guns and broke into the plaintiff's house. Wang and Zhang scared away the family members of the house owner, and Yao Sheng immediately took the child Wang Delin, who was lying in bed, and carried him out. They hired a rickshaw to the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Gao Naiyi Road, got into the car, and sent him to No. 1 Xinyi Lane, Xujiahui Road, to hide him. They notified Ying Weishui and sent a letter to the plaintiff demanding a huge ransom for his release. On February 2nd of this year, on Ying's instructions, they moved the hostage to No. 511 Hong'an Lane, Laobazi, and recruited the two female bandits, Xiang Ma Shi and Shen Ma Shi, to guard him. After the case was discovered, the defendants were arrested. They all confessed to the above facts. The police are now prosecuting them in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and are requesting that they be interrogated and dealt with according to the law. The fifth defendant, Shi Yu Shi, claimed that she was going to visit the sixth defendant, Shen Ma Shi, when she was arrested and that she was not involved in the case. She requested that the court investigate. The court verified the report and ordered the defendants to be taken down and questioned one by one separately. The defendants all confessed that they had carried out the kidnapping and guarded the hostage. They also said that Zhang Genfu, who is at large, initiated the plan and that Ying Weishui agreed to provide the funds. The court then summoned the kidnapped Wang Delin to the stand to question him about the kidnapping. After the questioning, the court announced that the case would be adjourned to the 20th and that a defense lawyer would be appointed to the case for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>Chen You Ting, a native of Wenzhou, was 27 years old. He used to work as a waiter for a Westerner. A month ago, his wife suddenly became critically ill in his hometown. Because of this, Chen resigned from his job and returned home to visit her. Unexpectedly, when he arrived home, his wife had already passed away. After hearing the news, Chen was extremely grief-stricken. He had no choice but to take care of the funeral arrangements. Later, he returned to Shanghai and stayed with his brother, Chen Youxiu, at No. 1054 Yuyuan Road. Recently, Chen repeatedly asked his friends to help him find a suitable job, but he was unable to find one. As a result, he lost both his money and his wife, and he felt increasingly frustrated. The day before yesterday, he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. He went out alone and bought opium, which he secretly swallowed. Later, his brother noticed and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered Detective Shi Huanting to investigate. The body was then taken to the Philan Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Zhang Junqing, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. He then ascended to the court and questioned Chen Youxiu, the brother of the deceased, who stated that his brother had recently used up all his money because his wife had suddenly died. In addition, he was currently unemployed. As a result, he committed suicide out of resentment. After hearing the statement, Zhang Jun ruled that the deceased, Chen You Ting, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his brother, Chen Youxiu, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

He was trusted by the manager of the factory, Cha Jianshi, and others. At the same time, Zhu was also very diligent in his work. Although he occasionally had minor illnesses, he never asked for leave to rest. Therefore, recently, Zhu became weak and ill. Manager Cha Jianshi repeatedly told him to ask for leave to recuperate, but he never did. Recently, the manager and colleagues of the factory, seeing that Zhu was getting weaker and weaker, repeatedly advised him to rest. Zhu finally asked for leave the day before yesterday, but because he did not want to leave the factory, he still stayed in the factory. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhu suddenly used a small paper cutter to stab a hole in his throat. Immediately, blood gushed out, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. A colleague in the bedroom suddenly heard Zhu moaning and got up to check. He saw Zhu lying in a pool of blood, still bleeding from his throat. When asked why, he was vague and ambiguous. The colleague changed his bloody clothes and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his blood vessels were not injured, and there was no major problem. He is still hospitalized for treatment. At the same time, the factory urgently telegraphed Zhu's family to call his wife to Shanghai. As for why he suddenly had the idea of ending his life, the people in the factory said that Zhu had suffered a huge loss in the silk cocoon business, and perhaps this was the reason.</p>

<p>| The Criminals Sentenced Separately |</p>
<p>Zhou A Si and Wu A Da, natives of Tongzhou, colluded with Zhang Huilin, who is at large, from May to June. They repeatedly wrote letters of extortion and delivered them to No. 287 Zhaofeng Road, demanding 1,000 yuan from Sun Yuanyou, a native of Nanjing. There were as many as six letters. Each letter contained one bullet and was written in strong language, threatening to take action if the money was not paid. The Huishan Police Station was informed and sent Detective Wang Jinsheng to arrest Zhou and Wu. They confessed that the rickshaw puller of the victim's family, Zhang Cai Gen, also known as A Er, was the informant. The detectives rushed to arrest Zhang and brought him to the police station. It was learned that Wu A Da wrote the extortion letters alone, but Wu denied it. The police asked him to write a confession in person for handwriting comparison. They were sent to the First Court. Zhou A Si admitted that he was fooled by Zhang Huilin, who is at large. Zhang Cai Gen's confession was evasive. Zhou A Si firmly denied that he wrote the extortion letters. The court ordered a detailed investigation and asked experts to study the handwriting on file. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court for further interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the previous events and stated that the investigation revealed that Zhang Cai Gen had told Zhang Huilin, who is at large, that the Sun family was rich and that the younger master (Sun Yuanyou) was very timid after the death of the old master and that he could be intimidated with a letter of extortion and that there was hope. The victim was asked to come to court for questioning. According to Sun Yuanyou, after receiving the letter, the rickshaw puller Zhang Cai Gen said that he would not go to manage it because it was too dangerous. The three defendants were questioned, and their statements were the same as before, evading responsibility. The court declared that the letters written by Wu A Da and his confession written at the police station had been examined by the court's special appraiser, Mr. Yin. The six letters of extortion were entirely written by him without any doubt. Therefore, Zhou A Si was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Wu A Da to three years of imprisonment, and Zhang Cai Gen to two years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the final judgment were deducted from the sentence at the rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The letters of extortion and bullets were confiscated.</p>

Now, it is offered at a special price of 80 cents to facilitate students' purchase. It is sold by the Medical Bookstore, No. 204 May Bellek Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editors,</p>
<p>Regarding the article "Zhabei Silk Factory Strikes Again Yesterday" in your newspaper's local section on July 13th, which stated, "…for Sunday overtime, according to regulations, each person should receive $0.58, but the factory only paid $0.50. Therefore, the workers questioned the factory. However, according to the factory's reply, the $0.08 was deducted at the request of the union to be handed over to the union…" this is far from the truth. An agreement was reached through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau that overtime pay would be set at two working days per month, with wages at $0.50 per day, and Sunday overtime at $0.20 per week. This was published in your newspaper. Thus, since there was no $0.58 overtime pay, how could the union request the factory to deduct $0.08? The aforementioned news is clearly a misunderstanding and does not conform to the facts. We are deeply concerned that this may mislead the public and request an immediate correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e199">Making Literature with Strawberries <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>Some say that a writer from a certain social stratum can only write about that social stratum, because they cannot be untrue to their lives.</p>
<p>At first glance, this high-sounding theory is quite admirable. No matter how "tyrannical" a critic is, they wouldn't "order" a writer to tell lies.</p>
<p>But upon closer examination, it seems somewhat doubtful. First, according to this theory, it seems as if a person's social existence is predetermined by the King of Hell in a previous life and cannot be changed. But the actual situation is not necessarily so. For example, wealthy farmers become coolies, students enter factories, and there are extreme examples of high-ranking scholars pulling rickshaws. Of course, writers are the excellent members of the nation and should be able to do as they please, but if he or she is also a social being, how can they always sit in a fragrant and melodious place like "Mount Tai Stone Dare to Act"? Second, a writer from a certain social stratum may not necessarily understand the life of that social stratum. There are many examples of this, such as the writers who are now shouting about petty-bourgeois revolutionary literature, none of whom can fully portray the suffering of the petty bourgeoisie. Similarly, although not from that social stratum, one can break into, integrate into, and grow in that social stratum. Like Fadeyev, Barbusse, Kobayashi Takiji...</p>
<p>What is the key here? The answer is the same: it depends on whether the writer is true to life. But there is also a slight difference: the "life" referred to here does not only refer to the narrow experience of a permanently unchanged abstract thing, but to the practice associated with the dynamic society. And this includes the dynamic role of human cognition.</p>
<p>Today I read Ritsuno Nobuyuki's "Strawberries" in the July issue of "Chuo Koron." On such a hot day, seeing the word "strawberries" easily brings to mind "strawberry milk," a good thirst quencher. But there is none of that fragrance in this novel. Instead, using strawberry cultivation as the main focus of the story, it depicts the changes in the rural economy, the hardships of farmers, the tragedies caused by hardship and desperate labor, and the process of awakening. The analysis of the rural social structure, the explanation of various planting problems such as fertilizer and climate, and the depiction of farmers' emotions are not something that can be achieved solely with a little experience. Needless to say, Ritsuno is an intellectual, but his creative activities have not been confined by a small range of experience. This novel illustrates his efforts.</p>
<p>However, our "writers," apart from sitting in their rooms and writing big articles on white paper about what banner to raise, do not bother with things like strawberry research.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Akita Ujaku's Fifty Years <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Yuan</p>
<p>Akita Ujaku, known as the "Japanese Gorky," is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of his birth this year.</p>
<p>Akita was born in 1883 in Aomori Prefecture in northeastern Japan. During the Russo-Japanese War, influenced by the anti-war arguments of the time, he became a supporter of the early socialist movement in Japan, including figures such as Katayama Sen and Kotoku Shusui. He did not appear on the literary scene until after 1905, initially writing poetry and novels, gradually developing an interest in theatrical creation, and successively publishing collections such as "Phantoms and Nocturnes," "Buried Spring," and "Young Playwrights."</p>
<p>During World War I, the successive deaths of his father and son, and the gradual impoverishment of his life, plunged him into a state of pessimism and nihilism for a time. At that time, he studied Tolstoy's religious theories and Indian philosophy. During this period, he published "Three Souls" and "The Death of Buddha."</p>
<p>From 1919 to 1926, Japan was truly a difficult autumn. The impoverishment of the entire nation after the Great War triggered the democracy movement, and there was also a "people's art" movement in culture. This movement soon developed into the so-called "art of the Fourth Estate." Regarding this period, Akita wrote in his autobiography "My Fifty Years": "I heard the sound of boiling from beneath the ground I was walking on."</p>
<p>In 1921, the Light Movement emerged, followed by the establishment of the "Sower" group. It was also during this period that he studied Esperanto with extraordinary enthusiasm. In his own words: "Esperanto transformed me into a completely different person. I felt that I was saved by Esperanto. I finally became a cheerful and lively world citizen. The literary world is simply a narrow and disgusting place."</p>
<p>In October 1927, Akita was invited to the Soviet Union as a state guest to attend the tenth anniversary of the revolution.</p>
<p>During his stay in Russia, he used Esperanto to visit various places and wrote "Young Soviet Union" after returning home, which was praised as "Even young people who are proficient in Russian may not be able to observe so precisely."</p>
<p>From the "people's art" movement to the present, he has been moving forward with the times without taking a step back. He personally experienced the various stages in various fields of the modern Japanese cultural movement. He personally "sowed seeds" and nurtured the emerging Japanese culture. He served as the director of the International Culture Research Institute, the director of the Proletarian Science Research Institute, the director of the New Education Research Institute, the chairman of the Central Committee of the World Esperanto Association, the chairman of the Anti-Religious League when it was founded, and was also an outstanding literary and theatrical writer and a leader of the Japan-Russia Cultural Exchange Association. We cannot fail to mention his name when discussing the modern cultural movement in Japan.</p>
<p>But he is not a writer who, like Gorky, came from the working class. In his fifty-year career, he experienced painful "self-struggles" and a series of hard-fought struggles as a revolutionary intellectual. Perhaps because of this, we feel even more lovable and have a sense of intimacy.</p>
<p>What we find most interesting is that, at such an old age, he enthusiastically studied Esperanto and said, "I was saved by Esperanto." We, who do not have a personal experience of the gloomy intellectual world of Japanese capitalist society at the end of the Meiji era and the beginning of the Taisho era, probably cannot fully understand it. But if we think of how Arishima Takeo and Akutagawa Ryunosuke solved their problems with "death," and how Mushanokoji Saneatsu degenerated in order to find a way out, in contrast, "I was saved by Esperanto" is not only not excessive, but is it not the most truthful confession?</p>
<p>Recently, at a gathering in the Tokyo cultural world to celebrate his fiftieth birthday, he agreed to write a masterpiece using the process of the Japanese intellectual class's struggle over the past two or three decades as the theme. When the news came, we couldn't help but sincerely congratulate him on his fiftieth birthday and wish him good health!</p>
<h3 id="e201">Essentials of Climbing the Literary Ladder <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Recently, a bookstore published a book called "Essentials of Climbing the Literary Ladder." Because I wanted to use that dollar for something else, I have not yet had the good fortune to read it. Fortunately, I have seen quite a few writers climbing the ladder. From their actions, I can learn a few techniques for climbing the ladder. I jotted down a few at random and used the topic to write an article on "Essentials of Climbing the Literary Ladder." Perhaps some people who are eager to climb the ladder but don't have the money to buy the book might as well take a look.</p>
<p>An unknown writer who wants to become famous has to interact with famous people. If the famous person pays attention to you, you can write "my friend" and the like in your articles. If they ignore you, you can scold them. Fortunately, you don't need much reason to scold people. For example, place of origin, age, or even family relationships can all be used as material for scolding. Anyway, people will pay attention when they see you dare to scold someone.</p>
<p>When writing works, you have to see what others like. If people like to read sexual history, you specialize in writing love novels with triangles and quadrangles and swollen lower bodies. You must write about women as being very horny and able to provoke men. This way, your books will sell well, and readers will not show any signs of fatigue.</p>
<p>You can also open your own bookstore and run your own magazine. You can publish whatever nonsense or nauseating things you write as if they were interesting. You can also ask someone to translate your work into a foreign language and then brag that your work is international.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the opportunity arises, you can also make a change and write some riot novels, but you must always be careful. If there is even a slight rumor, you must quickly write a confession and a letter of repentance, stating that you are no longer involved. At that time, you raise a self-made banner of some sort to show that your position is firm.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, you can specialize in being an intelligence gatherer, saying that so-and-so is so-and-so's pseudonym, and that so-and-so lives there. This way, you will also become famous. Not only do you gather information about others, but you can also publish your own information and put it together with famous people, and even publish more photos.</p>
<p>All of the above are just examples. However, the most important thing is to specialize in one of them, and then you will have the technique to climb the ladder. In ancient times, scholars studied hard for ten years in order to achieve fame and fortune. Today, people sharpen their heads just to make a living. In the past, writers sold large characters; today, writers sell small characters. It's all the same: selling. Who cares about face? Only those fools will truly do literature. Their contribution is to insist on life and explore reality to the end. In the end, they will end up with no trace of their death. You must never imitate them!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Teatime Chat <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Qiushan</p>
<p>Drinking tea is the most democratic thing. Those who have leisure, of course, use tea as a gift and as a good way to pass the time. Even ordinary people, such as farmers and woodcutters in villages, and workers in the city, are no different. In the faint cold dusk, or in the sweltering evening, a few friends go to the tea house together, brew a pot of tea, sit around a simple tea table, sip at will, and talk casually, dispelling the fatigue of a day's work. Although the methods of drinking tea are different, the pleasure caused by tea is the same.</p>
<p>But there are many things to pay attention to when drinking tea, and the most particular ones are probably the people of Fujian. I remember when I was at home, living a quiet life in my study, with bright windows and a clean space, I often used small Yixing teapots as big as oranges, snow-white tea cups as small as lychees, celadon porcelain bowls and plates from the Chenghua and Xuande periods with wrinkled patterns, teapot mats woven from dragon eye rushes or cogon grass, and copper-tin canisters, arranged randomly on the tea tray. I selected famous Wuyi Mountain rock tea varieties, heated them in a red kiln, and took dried cogon grass or charcoal core, stuffed it into the cracks and burned it. I placed a jade silk pot filled with clear spring water on the stove. When the water was about to boil, I first rinsed the empty teapot, put in the tea leaves, poured in boiling water, covered the spout of the teapot, then poured water on the teapot and small cups, and rotated to wash the cups. Then, I poured the tea, with a color like malachite and smoke like light mist. The fragrant and refreshing taste penetrated my heart and spleen. In front of the misty rain window, with two or three close friends, we slowly sipped together, and ate some candied fruits and light tea snacks. It was really a pleasure to cultivate one's emotions, and all the worldly atmosphere and worries were thrown to the four winds. But in the past ten years or so, I have been living in other places. Although I still drink tea every day, due to the busyness of work, there is actually a lack of opportunity to savor it leisurely. I have no choice but to ignore whether it is good or bad and just casually brew it and drink it. Recalling the Qingfu of the past, I can't help but feel a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Last month, I traveled to West Lake and brought back a few catties of wild tea from Wengjia Village. The taste is more refreshing than ordinary Longjing. I often take a small amount of it during my leisure time in the morning and evening, add rock sugar and rose flowers, put it in a white porcelain covered cup or glass cup, fill it with boiling water, and place it on the table. Watching the curled green leaves float and unfold in the water cup like cellophane noodles, it makes people feel a piece of ice, and the sultry heat is completely eliminated. I feel that it is much better than eating those Ice Wafers. Therefore, I wrote "Tea Chat" to tell the world's friends who have the same hobby.</p>
<p>Fictional Novel</p>
<h3 id="e203">Ordinary Things (11) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"It's useless for you and me to argue at this time. Anyway, when things come to a head, there will always be a natural solution. Being tough in words is of no use."</p>
<p>Pei Yu had no choice but to end it like this, but she still couldn't help but say these two sentences:</p>
<p>"If Zhiguang's family had not returned to Hangzhou, then he would not have gone to Zhabei."</p>
<p>"If he didn't go to Zhabei, would things at the factory be better?" Bo Tang said.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Zhiguang and Bo Tang were both civil engineers who graduated from France. However, Zhiguang initially went there by taking advantage of the work-study opportunity. Before entering a specialized school, he spent several years working in factories in France. Later, he encountered an opportunity and gradually had the mental and material ability to enter a polytechnic in Paris to study civil engineering. He happened to be in the same class as Bo Tang, so they became friends. In terms of temperament, Bo Tang was a generous, upright, and beauty-loving son of a wealthy family, while Zhiguang was a serious, precise, and very considerate scholar from the countryside. In terms of practical interest, Bo Tang's specialty in civil engineering was decorative art, while Zhiguang's specialty in civil engineering was structural planning. Of course, these two reasons can help us understand their personalities, but the benefit of their years of learning and sharpening together at school made them become bosom friends. After returning to China, Bo Tang worked as a technical official in the Xin Jing municipal government for a year, while Zhiguang worked in a construction company in Shanghai. Later, Bo Tang felt that the rise and fall of his career was as uncertain as the wind. It just so happened that he was newly married, and his new wife, Ms. Peiyu, did not approve of the living and eating habits in Xin Jing, so Bo Tang resigned from his official position, embraced Peiyu, and returned to his old residence in Shanghai to live a warm life. After more than half a year, Bo Tang reached a state of being too quiet and wanting to move. He saw that the construction industry in Shanghai was developing day by day, so he took out a portion of his ancestral property and organized the Changxing Construction Factory, and invited Zhiguang to join Changxing and entrusted him with the position of chief engineer.</p>
<p>For three or four years, Changxing's business has been one of the best in Shanghai. Of course, one reason is that Bo Tang relies on his family background and therefore has very long arms, and the second is that their technology is indeed outstanding. However, the fundamental point of Changxing's victory, which is unmatched, is Bo Tang's ability to know people and make good use of them, and Zhiguang's effective management. Zhiguang uses a reasonable system for hiring people on the one hand, and uses a cooperative system for treating people on the other hand. Therefore, the efficiency of work can certainly be high, and the relationship between labor and capital can also be good. When the "January 28th" anti-Japanese incident occurred, Changxing naturally stopped working along with the trend of the entire city. After three or five days, the workers in the factory gradually followed the trend of the enthusiastic men in the city, and some went to join the 19th Route Army. They each contributed their skills, received the command of the officers, and helped those soldiers do some emergency defense work. Zhiguang also did his best to give them many conveniences.</p>
<p>In the face of such a great enemy, these good men who came and went empty-handed and had no worries were truly fearless, especially when they encountered a group of people in foreign clothes and under a different national flag invading our territory. They not only forgot what money was, not only forgot what family was, but even their only self was given to that "we" in their mouths to resist that "they" in their mouths!</p>
<p>However, it seemed that this "we" resisting that "they" could not be resolved in a day or two, so these good men who had rushed from the city to the front line to volunteer felt that simply giving themselves to this "we" could not last. Therefore, they further sought help from those who were close to them. Although the scope of their requests for help clearly identified the words "those who are close to them," they did not expect that the reasons for human beings approaching each other were different, so they were even less concerned about the consciousness of those who were being asked for help. For example, the workers of Changxing Construction Factory asking Bo Tang for help is a clear example.</p>
<p>At about six o'clock this morning, Zhiguang got up and went to the factory first, according to the method agreed upon with Bo Tang last night. He rode his two-wheeled bicycle, and drove more than ten minutes from his residence near Caishi Road, passing through the iron barbed wire gate along the south side of the French Concession, which symbolized a story of nervous anxiety, before arriving near Dananmen. The morning market near Dananmen was still as busy as usual. Although there were many military police with pink collar tabs on the street, the police with white collar tabs seemed to imitate the military police's solemn but gentle attitude towards the citizens because of the presence of the military police. Therefore, every time Zhiguang left any iron barbed wire gate at the southern end of the French Concession, he seemed to only see the police checking for traitors, but he did not see them forcibly seizing the pads of rickshaws. Originally, if there was any small dispute unrelated to national borders on any street in Shanghai, as long as someone said, "We are all family," then the dispute would be resolved immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Financial Market: Gold Standard Plummets Uncontrollably <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>A disastrous fall to 26 yuan</p>
<p>New Low Prices Reappear</p>
<p>The gold market was turbulent yesterday, with extreme volatility. Initially, both British and American silver prices rose, while in the foreign exchange market, the British pound fell and the US dollar surged. At the Five Metals Exchange, forward silver prices rose by 0.064 yuan. American cotton soared by over 80 points, stocks by over 1 yuan, and American wheat by over 0.01 yuan. Despite reports of the United States considering amendments to gold prohibition laws, the gross price retreated to 0.034 yuan, further dropping to 796.7 yuan. Banks made slight gains and rebounded, but the initial shock made it difficult to recover. Later, a Reuters report stated that US Senator Pittman said that the International Silver Agreement was nearing completion, gradually weakening the situation. It broke the 90 yuan barrier, and off-market expectations dropped to 80 yuan, igniting a selling frenzy. Rumors circulated in the market that the US had already signed the Silver Agreement and that countries like France and the Netherlands were abandoning the gold standard, creating widespread panic. Before opening, prices plummeted to 755.6 yuan. After opening, Ruixing and others covered their short positions, stabilizing the situation. Bombay saw minimal fluctuations, breaking even after covering, with little impact. Various unconfirmed rumors gradually pushed prices up as short-covering intensified. Qingfa, Yongchang, Sheng Yong, Daxing, and Yongyi repeatedly pursued purchases, bringing the closing price back to the same level as at noon, completely recovering. Speculator Wu made a profit, with the "cooked red" price adding an additional 230 yuan. The day's market conditions are detailed below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 799.8 yuan, a further drop of 10.07 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 9.5 yuan, and the foreign exchange market opened strong. Recent selling prices were: British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 4375, US exchange at 30.03125 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongheng, Xingyuan, Xingyong, Zhifeng, and Yongfen sold, retreating to 4.2 yuan.

Mitsui took October at 125, and HSBC quoted British long at 125 and American long at 875. By the announcement, prices had recovered to around 6 yuan.

Richang, Bing, and Fuchang Zhifengyong Zhaofengchang sold again, dropping to 1 yuan. Hengxing and others advanced to 3.5 yuan. Shunli, Fuchang, Daxingyong, and Zhaofengchang sold again, with unfavorable news. October US dollars at 1875 were difficult to sell, breaking the 90 yuan barrier. It seemed October at 25 was also difficult to settle. Zhaofengchang, Ruikang, and Dadecheng advanced again to 93 yuan. Market sentiment was extremely negative. Fuyu and Richang sold to within 90 yuan. Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmaoyong, and Zhaofengchang strongly purchased, pulling prices up to over 92 yuan. Huabi offered October US dollars at 25, Fuyu, Hengxing, and Yuanchun strongly sold, and the foreign exchange market strengthened significantly. Banks once filled October US dollars at 375, and Tongtaichang and Zhifengyong sold again at 85.2 yuan. Mitsui took October at 0.5 yuan, pulling the noon close up to 787.3 yuan. After the close, sellers suddenly became eager, and goods were fiercely pressed to a bid of 5 yuan. Fuyu came to sell, and retail investors settled, retreating to within 82 yuan. Xianghe and Zengfen sold a significant amount.</p>
<p>The after-market initially quoted 80 yuan, and Fuchang immediately came to sell aggressively, alarming the market. Rumors spread that countries like France and the Netherlands were abandoning the gold standard, creating a gloomy and bleak atmosphere across the entire market. Fuchang, Yuanchun, Hengxing, Shunli, and others successively sold, dropping to 55.6 yuan. Qingfayong came to purchase, and the opening price was 761 yuan, with goods opening at 2 yuan. Prices then retreated from 2 yuan to 60 yuan. Hengxing, Yuanshengyong, Ruixing, Runchang, Yuyuanmaoyong vigorously purchased, and Mitsui took in October US dollars at 32.25, rising to 8 yuan.

Yuanxingyong and Zhaofengchang also came to sell aggressively. Short-covering was courageous, and Fuyu, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Shunli, Yifengyong, Qingfayong, and Hengxing repeatedly purchased, gradually tightening the foreign exchange market and rising to over 80 yuan, with slight pullback, not hindering the overall situation. Goods were purchased most vigorously, with Zhifengyongchang, Shengyongqingfayong, Daxingyong, and others successively advancing, rebounding to 85 yuan. The closing price was 784.5 yuan. After the close, Qingfayong and Daxingyong continued to advance, once rising to 78 yuan. Later, Huabi offered October US dollars at 625, and Shanghai offered 5625, retreating to within 2 yuan. Goods bid at 84 yuan. The highest price of the day was 799.8 yuan, and the lowest was 760 yuan, with a fluctuation of 39.8 yuan. The result was a fall of 26 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 875 for HSBC's US dollar listing, making it 29.875, equivalent to a gold standard price of 803 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was pressed by approximately 18.65 yuan, more than 1.5 yuan stronger than the previous close.

<h3 id="e205">Origin of the Firm Gold Jewelry Market <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>| Shortage of Spot Goods |</p>
<p>| Those Who Have It Don't Want to Keep Much |</p>
<p>| Those Who Seek It Cannot Obtain Much |</p>
<p>While the gold standard has plummeted continuously, gold jewelry in silver shops remains firm. The "cooked red" price has reached an additional 250 yuan or more, a stark contrast to the addition of just over ten taels when the gold market was stable in the past. This indicates that spot goods are extremely scarce, a result of the cutoff of supplies from visiting merchants. Furthermore, spot stores are wary of keeping too much stock due to the wide disparity between the futures and "cooked red" prices. Goods are moving swiftly in ports such as Xiamen and Hong Kong, further diminishing the supply. Additionally, Xiamen customers, seeing the difficulty in securing goods in the gold market, are flocking to silver shops for jewelry, further driving up prices. The current price of gold jewelry, considering the "cooked red" price, the gold standard price, and the silversmith's fee, does not seem excessively high.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Soar, Foreign Exchange Market Remarkably Loose</p>
<h3 id="e206">US Dollar Hardens Past the 31 Yuan Mark <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London's long-term and short-term forwards both rose by a half-penny.</p>
<p>Silver rose by 0.0375 yuan, the British pound weakened against the US dollar by 0.0025, while the US dollar strengthened against the British pound by 0.09. The forward silver price rose by 0.064 yuan, and commodity prices generally increased. Recent selling prices were: British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 4375, US exchange at 30.03125 yuan, reflecting a strengthening of 0.001875 yuan for the British pound and a loosening of 0.005625 yuan for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, the British shilling gradually loosened, but the US dollar managed to stabilize. Banks had decent appetite. HSBC announced the exchange rates with the British pound rising by 125 and the US dollar rising by 875. After entering, the market situation gradually hardened, then remarkably loosened after the market opened, subsequently tightening again. This was due to gold traders needing to settle accounts, while banks showed little inclination to sell. After the gold market closed, purchases continued. The recent selling price at closing was: British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 5625, US exchange at 31.125 yuan, reflecting a strengthening of 0.003125 yuan for the British pound and a strengthening of 1.375 yuan for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Banks showed extremely sluggish appetite, with both buying and selling sluggish. Gold traders were forced to purchase nearly ten million pounds worth of shillings, while the US dollar broke even with little difference. The French franc was largely settled by the Guangdong gang in the aftermarket, nearly one million, by French and other entities. September 5625 and October 5625.

<h3 id="e208">Few Clearances, Stable Interest Rates <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The prosperity or stagnation of commercial goods sales in Shanghai hinges entirely on the eagerness or sluggishness of various ports. Currently, during the traditionally slow summer season, there are naturally no significant imports or exports. Consequently, financial adjustments are not particularly strong, and the market atmosphere is calm. Interest rates have therefore remained stable, without any significant fluctuations. Yesterday, they remained at the market price of 5 fen, identical to the previous day. Both morning and afternoon markets saw no slight changes in the price. Blank checks were still just that, without additional water. Check transactions in the morning market amounted to over 4.0 million, new transactions over 1.4 million, and afternoon transactions over 400,000. Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 300,000. Banks cleared foreign merchant check funds of over 1.0 million silver dollars and over 1.6 million foreign dollars. Special funds clearances totaled over 2.1 million silver dollars. Various cargo mortgages, remittance fees, and miscellaneous clearances totaled over 2.2 million silver dollars and over 2.6 million foreign dollars. Warehouse releases amounted to 300,000 silver dollars and 400,000 foreign dollars. Chinese merchant banks cleared over 2.1 million silver dollars in check funds, over 4.0 million in various cargo remittances, taxes, and miscellaneous items, and over 2.4 million in special funds, with 600,000 entering the warehouse. Japanese merchant banks saw 400,000 silver dollars and 300,000 foreign dollars enter the warehouse.

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu small silver dollar market remained unchanged in the morning and afternoon, calculated at 842 yuan, consistent with the previous day's market price. Trading was very simple, with only 6,000 jiao transacted in the morning market. The Guangdong small silver dollar market saw a slight improvement in sales, resulting in slightly better buying interest. Consequently, market prices rose accordingly. The morning market was at 774 yuan, and the afternoon market was at 774.5 yuan, resulting in a significant increase of 1.3 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Traded volume amounted to 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper cash increased slightly by 500 wen, to 317,500 wen, with a transaction volume of over 41,900 strings, valued at 13,200 foreign dollars.</p>
<p>Securities Trading: Fewer Transactions in the Half-Day Market</p>
<h3 id="e210">Most Public Bonds End Higher, Few Lower <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Bullish Camp Is Heavily Fortified, Showing No Signs of Collapse</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange only conducted half-day trading in the morning. Buying and selling were not as lively as before. Although the trend showed slight changes, it was not beyond the reporter's expectations. However, the situation showed no signs of collapse. Bulls occasionally emerged, slightly lowering market prices, but as soon as they stopped, prices immediately rebounded, sometimes exceeding the initial level. The strength of the bullish camp was evident. This was because of ample silver reserves in the financial community. Most buyers purchased in anticipation of receiving goods, and those short sellers without goods to deliver would inevitably panic. Furthermore, with the initial stabilization of the situation and strong customs revenue, the demand for bonds increased sharply. Once the Sino-British loan is officially established, there will be further excitement in the future. Yesterday, at the opening, bullish activity in lots 13 and 47 slightly weakened market prices, with most falling by about 0.5 yuan. Lots 96 and the entire lot 6 were slightly better, rising by 0.035 yuan. In the second round, lot 32 saw strong buying, and the demobilization quickly rose by 0.5 yuan, reviving optimistic sentiment. Afterwards, due to strong demand, the uptrend was even stronger, with salt tax rising sharply by 0.7 yuan. The trend was quite strong. Twenty-volume current month and salt tax full lot 6 next month saw new highs. The result was more gains than losses, with the twenty-volume and twenty-customs consolidated tax both falling by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, while the rest continued to rise by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan up to 0.07 yuan. The upward momentum still had residual strength. The total transaction volume was 8,413,000 yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot goods, 3,470,000 yuan in futures of consolidated salt tax, 625,000 yuan in demobilization, 530,000 yuan in 19-customs surtax, 1,640,000 yuan in twenty-volume and twenty-customs, with the rest ranging from tens of thousands to over 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e211">New York Stock Market Continues to Advance <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that the New York stock market trend turned firm on Wednesday. Wet shares rose another 15 yuan due to the end of prohibition in Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Other stocks advanced slowly. Traders mostly stood aside due to complex exchange rate conditions. The total daily volume was 5,190,000 shares. Wheat created new highs due to Canadian news favoring the bullish side and continued damage to spring wheat, attracting new buyers. American cotton saw a tidal wave of buying due to the Secretary of Agriculture's declaration that cotton acreage would be reduced by 10 million acres, with few sellers, resulting in a surge of about 90 points. According to the Steel Age magazine, steel production increased to 59 percent this week. Steel demand will decrease slightly in the future. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 104.55 Up 1.47</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 54.30 Up 0.06</p>

<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, but the overall trend was stable. Due to the American implementation of inflationary policies, American cotton surged 90 points, stimulating market sentiment. Buyers showed signs of excitement again, and the market situation was quite strong. However, spot yarn sales failed to be stimulated. Various merchants are still suffering from economic difficulties, resulting in weak purchasing power. Therefore, the yarn market remains lackluster.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Yarn Rises by Over One Yuan <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, sentiment was firm due to the rise in American cotton, and a certain organization covered its short positions, with prices rising by over 2 yuan for each month. In the second and third rounds, prices fell again, resulting in gains of 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.9 jiao. In the afternoon, reports of sluggish real demand and a sharp drop in the gold market led to prices falling by 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 jiao for each month. The total volume of transactions for the day was 54,300 bales. Sales included: Dafeng 1,700 bales, Renfeng 1,150 bales, Changfeng 1,850 bales, Huachang 850 bales. Purchases included: Meiji 3,000 bales, Senkang 1,500 bales, Yichang 3,350 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Suilong 1,000 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales have turned sluggish again. Total purchases by various merchants for the day amounted to 420 bales, with prices rising by 1 yuan. Purchases by merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 223 Sichuan 145 Nanjing 2 Hankou 10</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Wuhu 5 Northern Merchants 20 Counterparts 5</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but then fell. Although American cotton surged, the gold market plummeted, and silver prices did not see a significant increase. Therefore, the enthusiasm of new buyers was lackluster. Furthermore, the current weather is favorable. However, some speculators are heavily buying long positions, expecting foreign cotton to potentially rise further. Judging from the American cotton situation, prices are expected to rise. However, with the extended foreign exchange market, there is little confidence in the future situation.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Forward Cotton Rises by 0.4 to 0.5 Jiao <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng standard cotton market in the morning, sentiment was strong due to the sharp rise in American cotton, and buying interest was still strong. New cotton rose by 0.6 to 0.7 jiao, and old cotton rose by 0.35 jiao. In the afternoon, reports of a sharp drop in gold prices led to prices falling by 0.1 to 0.25 jiao for each month. The total volume of transactions for the day was 110,000 dan. Sales included: Jifeng 5,700 dan, Changhe 3,300 dan, Yifeng 2,400 dan, Shenji 2,400 dan, Renfeng 2,700 dan, Senkang 2,800 dan, Yuchang 2,400 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton surged 90 points due to drought-stricken areas lacking rain and Washington news favoring the bullish side, with public purchases driving vigorous and firm prices. Spot prices surged 90 points, and futures rose 83 to 89 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices rise by 6 points and futures rise by 23 points. Egyptian cotton saw spot prices fall by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market was stable due to a small number of wide heads covering positions, with Pinggar rising by 0.5 Robbie, Yumla rising by 0.25 jiao, and Bairasi rising by 0.75 jiao.

<h3 id="e218">Grain, Flour, and Wheat Prices Fall <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month initially showed firmness, followed by stability. With quotations for foreign wheat showing American wheat up about 4 to 6 jiao and Canadian wheat only up 4 to 5 fen, the market sentiment was quite buoyant after the opening. The current month benefited from factory short-covering, rising to 0.35 jiao. However, the market atmosphere for each of the forward months was weak and listless. With the current foreign wheat prices becoming speculative, the future remains uncertain. Furthermore, commodity prices are gradually rising, and the foreign exchange market is also rising continuously. As seen with the gold market's step-by-step collapse, there is still uncertainty in the future. Therefore, the prices fell. After the afternoon opening, the current month's situation was also affected. Reports circulated that some factories would restrict hedging, so floating longs covered. However, actual sales to customers were still not strong. It was reported that 200,000 bags of spot goods opened the day before were still in the hands of brokers, with actual sales accounting for less than 50,000 bags. Given these various factors, market sentiment became weak again. As a result, the current month fell 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day, August fell 0.0125 yuan, September fell 0.0175 yuan, October fell 0.015 yuan, November fell 0.01 yuan, and December fell 0.015 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices for each month turned stable and listless. Although quotations for foreign wheat showed Chicago wheat up 4 to 6 jiao and Canadian wheat up 4 to 5 fen, current spot goods merchants remain firm, but with a significant difference between near and far months, there were inevitably more hedgers. Furthermore, with the collapse of gold prices, factory demand also remained normal. Therefore, prices for near and far months fell by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, the near months remained weak, while the far months were slightly better. As a result, the current month fell 0.04 yuan, August fell 0.01 yuan, September fell 0.02 yuan, and prices for the remaining months were unchanged. The spot wheat market remains stable, with high-quality goods seeming to remain stable, while medium and lower-quality goods are flat. Wheat from Hezhou opened at 3.412 yuan, lower at 3 jiao; wheat from Puzhen at 3.52 yuan, lower at 4 jiao; wheat from Hushu at 3.57 yuan; wheat from Zhenjiang at 3.52 yuan, lower at 4.6 jiao; wheat from Yangzhou at 3.60 yuan; wheat from Taipingqiao at 3.55 yuan, lower at 5.2 jiao; wheat from Liuhe at 3.523 yuan; wheat from Baoying at 3.63 yuan; wheat from Mingguang at 3.75 yuan; wheat from Jiangyan at 3.70 yuan; wheat from Nanjing at 3.45 yuan; wheat from Anting Kunshan at 3.45 yuan; wheat from Shuangfeng at 3.50 yuan, lower at 4.5 jiao; wheat from Taicang at 3.50 yuan; wheat from Penglai at 3.45 yuan, lower at 3 jiao; Fuxin Fufeng wheat from cars at 4,500 bags, and wheat from ships at 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Thin Rice Sales Increase Slightly <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Originating from over 40 rice shops, business is still decent in this street. The market situation is unstable and fluctuates, but the outcome remains the same. Therefore, the price difference for Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang thick japonica rice, as well as Doyang pointed rice, is only a few cents, with little disparity. However, the demand for Tianjin rice varieties suddenly became enthusiastic, with over 2,000 packages of thin rice such as Qingjiao and Songsi being handled. Sellers once raised prices, causing the market to increase by a few cents. The price of Yinbian rice remains relatively stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Originating from various routes downstream, there are over 25 rice shops. The sales of white japonica rice are lackluster. The market situation is sluggish by 6-7 cents. There is a continuous supply of early thin rice. The sales of fresh and vibrant goods are better, while those of medium and lower quality are stagnant. Yangding pointed rice is priced softly, while Dukeqiao pointed rice is priced fairly. There is a slight tightening of the white Yuan rice supply.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Vast Discrepancies in Summer Cocoon Production in Jiangsu, Zhejiang</p>
<h3 id="e220">Jiangning Cocoon Production Reaches Its Limit <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>This year's spring cocoon harvest in Jiangning was insufficient. Most silkworm farmers raised summer cocoons as a supplement, but the silkworms were of poor quality, resulting in a remarkably meager cocoon yield. The cocoons were also of lower grade, and cocoon merchants did not collect them. Instead, they were sold to local silk merchants at a cocoon price of only around 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Lake Region Production Uniformly Nine-Tenths of Previous Years <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>This year's summer silkworm rearing in various silkworm areas of the Lake Region was quite prosperous, and cocoon production was abundant. It is uniformly estimated to be nine-tenths of the usual year. The highest cocoon price was 45 or 46 yuan, and the lowest was 28 or 29 yuan. The cocoon market has already concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Increasingly Sluggish <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>As foreign exchange rates increase, overseas silk prices continue to decline slightly. Although European firms in Shanghai are importing, Chinese silk merchants are holding back from selling due to the low prices. The market atmosphere is sluggish and quiet. French firms are on holiday. Yesterday, only English firms and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk and 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk. The prices remain relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Slight Fluctuations in the Tea Market <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai experienced slight changes. Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Northeast routes, handled by Baitou Zhuang, Yulong, Ruichang, and other firms, saw increased activity due to demand from Bombay. However, because the overseas prices were tight, the market fell by 8-9 yuan. The Zhenmei variety continued to be strong in French sales, with prices rising by 3-4 yuan, and there was no supply available on the market. The market situation for Xiumei, Ruimei, and Zhucha teas was stable. However, most merchants suddenly became hesitant regarding Zhenmei, which had been selling well for a long time, thus greatly diminishing the luster of the green tea market. In addition, only Russian firms such as Xiezhuhui and Huacha Gongsi were importing a small amount of Qimen black tea. Most British firms and other foreign firms have stopped importing, making it difficult to be optimistic about the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Follow Gold Prices Downward <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw continued decline in gold prices, ongoing rise in Dutch exchange rates, and a slight decrease in customs duties. The trend is weakening. The association quoted 24 yuan 40 cents for common grades of raw sugar and white sugar, down one cent, but there were still few buyers. Dutch red KD brand fell one and a half cents to 16 yuan 15 cents, with a few transactions. The price of cotton white Zhenji No. 1 from the local factory was quoted at 19 yuan 65 cents, but there was no deal. Jianbang announced a listing of 45 packages of large-package ice sugar at 22 yuan 60 cents. Wufu standard white ice sugar continued to be offered, still at 17 yuan 20 cents.</p>

<p>The second batch of Guangdong large tide branches arrived yesterday, with 11 boxes immediately being offered. The quality of the goods was still good, with a price of 23 yuan 20 cents, a decrease of one yuan 30 cents compared to the previous round.</p>

<p>▲Hatoyama Decides to Request Massive Arrests of Students by Japanese Police</p>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 13th) The student uprising at Kyoto Imperial University has intensified due to Education Minister Hatoyama's barbaric measures in dismissing six professors, triggering public outrage. Hatoyama yesterday ordered provincial education officials to go to Kyoto and met with President Matsui for five hours today. He also discussed with the head of the student affairs section, Abe, and decided to take high-pressure measures by requesting the police to conduct massive arrests of students to suppress the student uprising. However, graduates are still helping students and professors, so the future is still difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Education's Compilation and Examination Department was reorganized into the National Translation and Compilation Bureau, it was divided into two offices. The General Affairs Office remained within the Ministry of Education, while the Compilation and Examination Office moved to the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse behind the Drum Tower, near the municipal government's designated residential area on Shanxi Road. The area is spacious, sparsely populated, and has fresh air, making it very suitable for the bureau's staff to reside and work there. Director Xin Shuzhi found it inconvenient to have the bureau split into two locations, as he had to travel between them daily, and the various groups at both locations also experienced difficulties in coordinating matters. Therefore, he slightly expanded the existing housing at the Compilation and Examination Office on Shanxi Road, which is currently under renovation. It is reported that the General Affairs Office, currently located in the Ministry of Education, will be moved to Shanxi Road next week to consolidate operations. The Ministry of Education will then use the vacated space to establish a Inspectorate, which will be used for storing archives.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Jida University Introduces New Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Students <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>▲Students from Various Places are Sending Letters Requesting Enrollment Brochures</p>
<p>National Jinan University's recruitment of new students for this year, specifically for overseas Chinese students, will begin on August 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, and the examinations will be held on the 7th and 8th. Previous reports have covered these details. It is learned that the school, as the highest institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese, has the primary goal of cultivating overseas Chinese students. Due to the prevailing economic downturn in various overseas regions, many overseas Chinese parents feel financially burdened, and there is a lack of clear understanding of the domestic security situation. Fearing that overseas Chinese students may not be very enthusiastic about returning to China for education, the school has introduced new preferential measures to provide relief and encourage overseas Chinese students to return to China: ㈠ Transfer students: In addition to enrolling first-year students in the university, the Faculties of Arts, Sciences, and Commerce will also enroll overseas Chinese transfer students in the second and third years. The middle school department will fully enroll overseas Chinese students. In addition to third-year high school and junior high students, each grade will also enroll overseas Chinese transfer students. ㈡ Tuition exemption: All overseas Chinese students studying in the school's university or middle school departments, whose families are poor and whose circumstances are verified to be true, may be granted reduced or waived tuition fees, depending on the situation. ㈢ Registration and examination dates and locations: The registration for the aforementioned transfer students will be held at the same time as this year's recruitment of overseas Chinese students (August 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th), and the examinations will be held on August 7th and 8th. Those who are unable to arrive in time due to unforeseen circumstances may arrive at the school before August 15th, state the reason, and schedule a supplementary examination. Those who fail the examination may have special remedial measures arranged. The registration and examination locations are both at the school's campus in Zhenru, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Since promoting the "One-One Education" movement, the Municipal Education Association has been making tireless efforts to implement it. Its Second Municipal People's School, since Principal Chen Rongfa took office, has been borrowing the Puyu Primary School in Sanminfang, Puyu East Road, as its campus.

After the formalities were completed, Principal Chen reported on the preparation process, the school's situation, and its plans. This was followed by a speech by Municipal Education Association representative Zhang Lichun, titled "The Significance of the Municipal Education Association's 'One-One Education' Movement and the Awareness that Students of People's Schools Should Have." It is also reported that 35 of the 40 students at the school are rickshaw pullers, and the school is an experiment in education for rickshaw pullers.

<h3 id="e252">A Further Statement from the Chengzhong School Board of Trustees <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the private Chengzhong Middle School Board of Trustees reads: We respectfully begin by stating that we have read the article "Former Chengzhong Principal Ge States the Process of Hiring Faculty and Staff" in your esteemed newspaper on July 8th. Our board feels compelled to clarify certain factual inaccuracies. According to our school's established practice, all faculty and staff appointment letters should be jointly signed by the principal and the head of academic affairs. After former Principal Li took office in August of the 20th year, he reviewed the contracts of all faculty and staff and discovered that they had all been issued separately by former Principal Ge. The letters were dated August 1st. However, former Principal Ge had already resigned before August 1st, and the head of academic affairs had also left the school in July. Former Principal Li considered that these appointment procedures were not in compliance. Following the usual practice when new and old principals transition at the beginning of a school term, he deemed them invalid. Therefore, he re-hired more than sixty faculty and staff members. Only about ten were not re-hired. Who knew that these un-rehired faculty and staff members would insist that the appointment letters sent in advance by former Principal Ge should be valid? Thus, the dispute arose. This is how the case initially unfolded. From the beginning of the incident, our board clearly stated that it was difficult to immediately determine which procedures were legal: those of the current Principal Li or those of the departing Principal Ge. However, we sincerely hoped that all parties would set aside legal arguments and focus on reconciliation to resolve the matter. Now, the Supreme Court has ruled that the un-rehired faculty and staff members had been certified by former Principal Ge and that the appointment letters, though dated August 1st, were actually sent in late June, and therefore valid. Our school will, of course, abide by the judgment and assume responsibility for the un-rehired faculty and staff members. However, whether the school's loss was due to the negligence of former Principal Li or the error in the procedures of former Principal Ge's sending the appointment letters is another legal question for which society will render its fair judgment. As for former Principal Ge's statements, they contain many discrepancies with the facts. 1) Former Principal Ge claimed to have resigned on July 10th of the 20th year and issued appointment letters in late June of the same year. However, our board confirms that it received the resignation letter, signed by former Principal Ge and written by school staff, on June 26th of that year, not July 10th. The sending of appointment letters also occurred at that time. 2) Our board always consults with the principal to jointly decide on increases or decreases in important school positions, as they affect the budget. However, we never interfere with personnel matters. 3) Although our board sincerely and repeatedly urged former Principal Ge to stay when he resigned, after he left office, our colleagues, remembering his four years as principal and believing he deeply loved the school, gifted him a generous sum and allowed him to rent a school-owned house near the school, hoping he could continue to care for the school at any time. Unfortunately, since the school dispute arose, we have only heard of former Principal Ge repeatedly contacting the Education Bureau and the un-rehired faculty and staff members. He has not once consulted with our board, which our colleagues cannot help but regret. However, we dare not criticize former Principal Ge's "character" in the slightest. In short, for the past two years, the turmoil during former Principal Li's tenure had already left us exhausted. After the January 28th Incident, we have still been unable to collect rent on school property. Our colleagues are truly overwhelmed. We hope that members of society will consider the difficulties faced by the school's founder in establishing the school and offer assistance when possible. Our colleagues will, of course, uphold our original intention of protecting the school and work even harder. We are unwilling to engage in any further pointless arguments in writing. Sincerely, to the editor of the Shenbao Education News Column, from the private Chengzhong Middle School Board of Trustees, July 12th.</p>

<p>A letter from Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School reads: We respectfully begin by stating that we have read the news article "Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principal Seeks a Way Out for Students Who Failed One Subject in the Joint Entrance Examination" in your newspaper's Education News column on July 12th. It states that our school ranked first in the overall average score of the Jiangsu Provincial Joint Entrance Examination for graduates.

<h3 id="e257">A Fine Tale of the Zhuli Plum <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>There is Still the Fragrance of Xi Shi's Fingernails</p>
<p>Summer is truly the world of fruits. The signs on the fruit stalls are like the marquees outside theaters, advertising famous actors. The Zhuli plum is a seasonal delicacy, so the four characters "Jiaxing Zhuli Plum" on the fruit stalls are written with especially vigorous brushstrokes, easily catching the eyes of passersby.</p>
<p>"There is still the fragrance of Xi Shi's fingernails," is a famous line from an ancient poem praising the Zhuli plum of the Jingxiang Temple. Although the Zhuli plum is native to Jiaxing, the ones produced by Jingxiang Temple are considered the best. Jingxiang Temple's Zhuli plums have a special mark: the imprints of Xi Shi's pinch, with varying thickness and length, much like the marks of Emperor Xuanzong's fingernails on the back of the Kaiyuan Tongbao coins of the Tang Dynasty. Chinese people worship beauties, and there are always many legends. Some say it's Xi Shi's fingernail marks, and everyone believes it to be true. Especially scholars and literati regard it as a unique and excellent subject. Moreover, Mr. Zhu Zhuchu's "Songs of the Yuanhu Boat" says: "It is said that Xi Shi once pinched them, and to this day, every plum has fingernail marks." Hanging Xi Shi's name further enhances the value of Jingxiang Temple's Zhuli plums.</p>
<p>Since the best variety of Zhuli plum is in the Buddhist temple, officials constantly demanded them, with hardly a peaceful year. There were officials who would pre-seal the courtyards where the plums were produced with red stamps, thinking that this would ensure that all the fruits belonged to the government. But when the Zhuli plums ripened and they unsealed the yards to pick the fruits, there wasn't a single one left on the branches. This was because, since the Zhuli plum was so precious, it had to be irrigated daily after it bore fruit, and measures had to be taken to drive away flocks of birds, otherwise they would eat all the plums. The ignorant officials didn't understand why, and thought the monks had secretly picked the plums. They immediately forced the monks to kneel down and beat their bald buttocks. The monks, feeling wronged, wanted to cut down all the trees to eliminate the source of trouble. Mr. Zhu Zhuchu's preface to "Ode to the Zhuli Plum" states: "Recently, suffering from the demands of officials, the monks have cut down many of the trees, and I worry that there will be none left in the future." This explains the situation.</p>
<p>There is also a ridiculous anecdote about the Zhuli plum: During the Qing Dynasty, Zhejiang suffered from continuous rain, similar to the current "water, water everywhere" era. A governor said to his subordinate: "This year, the disaster victims are suffering greatly." The Magistrate of Jiaxing stepped forward and said: "Reporting to Your Excellency, the disaster victims in my county are not suffering." The governor laughed and said: "Since they are called disaster victims, how can they not be suffering?" After returning to his office, the magistrate found two baskets of the best Jingxiang Temple Zhuli plums and presented them to the governor, saying: "Please try these, Your Excellency. The Zhuli plums in my county are truly not bitter." The governor laughed, knowing that he had mistaken "disaster victims" for "Zhuli plums that are not bitter". Before long, he impeached the magistrate for neglecting his duties. The magistrate who had misunderstood "disaster victims" became a "disaster official" himself.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Ghost Stories <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Speaking of ghost stories, naturally our China is the most developed in this area. The new ghosts are big, the old ghosts are small, and since China's Pangu to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, up until the 22nd year of the Republic of China, there are so many years, months, days, and hours that who knows how many myriads upon myriads of ghosts both big and small there have been in the end? Unless one inquires of the Yanluo Wang who sits high and solemnly in the Hall of Souls, nobody would be able to know.</p>
<p>China's ghost stories – should several doctors, masters, and bachelors come together to compile a book, even the grand compilation of the Siku Quanshu would be hard-pressed to take sole pride of place. For instance, the ghostly underworld that has been passed down among the common people would cause even those foreign academy editors who compiled the Encyclopedia Britannica to feel shame for their lack of education. In the vast and boundless underworld, there is the Meng Po Pavilion, the Village of Evil Dogs, the Bridge of Helplessness, the Pool of Blood River, the Mountain of Sharp Blades, the Bewildering Array, the Platform of Longing for Home, the Fiery Inferno, the Eighteen Levels of Hell, the Six Paths of Reincarnation, and other great places. Although Arctic exploration teams, Himalayan exploration teams, and even Christopher Columbus, the Big Brother who discovered the New World, have not had the honor of visiting, our Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang once toured this place. If you, gentlemen, do not believe me, let The Journey to the West serve as proof.</p>
<p>As for the types of ghosts, like the complex circumstances of the ethnic groups of the world, there is also a wide variety. Big-headed ghosts, small-headed ghosts, hanged ghosts, wall-touching ghosts, starving ghosts, drowning ghosts, fire-burned ghosts, consumption-disease ghosts, and all sorts of forms and appearances – everything that one could want is available. In addition, there are battlefield ghosts that often wail, and aristocratic ghosts in great Chang'an mansions that can be heard when the sky is overcast. These ghosts are so many that they simply cannot be listed one by one. If you, readers, do not believe me, please see the Ullambana Festival during the Ghost Festival.</p>
<p>These things, those things, all have reliable evidence. If you say that it is superstition, that is truly a sin, and after death you will have to enter the hell of tongue-plucking, the Avici Hell. Please see, in the Chilean parliament, just last month two thousand fire-burned ghosts disturbed the parliamentarians to the extent that their hair stood on end and not a single one of them could stay at their seats peacefully. One can know that when a person dies, he becomes a ghost – this is an unbreakable truth.</p>
<p>Originally, this world is already full of gambling ghosts, lustful ghosts, opium-smoking ghosts, poverty ghosts, greedy ghosts, and snobbish ghosts. Between the human world that is hell and the ghostly underworld, humans are already few and ghosts are many, and for the ghostly underworld, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Beneath the blue sky, in the bright and clear world, if one doesn't speak of human things and instead speaks of ghost stories, that, too, has a different flavor.</p>

<p>▲Short Nap</p>
<p>A short nap can bring a bit of coolness, reclining in a rattan chair in the center of the room. A patch of green at the door suggests tranquility, while the scorching sun outside is wildly intense. To be still is to forget desire, and to live in peace is to know what you will lose. One lifetime of seeing things is to truly believe that, to pull wind and thunder to make a scene.</p>
<p>▲An Impression from Looking out over the Sassoon Building</p>
<p>Lights on a thousand streets the night is yet not over, alone I lean on the railing above the thirteen stories. The windows where the people reside look like honeycombs, looking down upon them the structure looms as a bird’s path. Nearly exhausted is our nation it is fitting it comes to this, in the end dirtying the soil how could it not have a start? The land where a thousand men spill sweat and blood, who will allow him to get one peaceful breath?</p>
<h3 id="e260">Croaking Frogs <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Zhao Shixiu has two lines of poetry that say, "During the yellow plum season, rain falls in every home, green grass ponds are filled with frogs." These lines have been popular for a long time. Right now, it is the "rain in every home" season, and naturally the entire world is also filled with "frogs everywhere."</p>
<p>Originally, frogs are amphibians. Throughout the year, you can see their tracks at any time or place, so there’s nothing special about that. But during this plum rain season, it is their most fertile, most expansive season. Here "Gok! Gok! Gok!" There "Gok! Gok! Gok!" Everywhere one can hear a continuous chorus of frogs. Who can say the present time is not a "world of croaking frogs?"</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said: "The swallows begin to nest on the painted rafters, the abandoned swamp is already filled with croaking frogs." Jia Dao said: "Meeting egrets after the rain, hearing the distant croaking frogs in the deep night." These are both understated statements about croaking frogs, neither affirming nor denying, not uttering a word of praise.</p>
<p>To compare a group of croaking frogs to people, old poems that contain deep meanings should take the few lines left by Lu You as the starting point for breaking through previous people's records. Lu You said: "Affectionate grass grows green along the wall; brazen frogs croak around the house." Again, he said, "The mind is like an old horse, though it knows the way; the body is like a croaking frog, not belonging to the officials." There are words within words here; there are sounds beyond the strings, which should be carefully savored! One praises, one criticizes, the statements appearing to contradict each other before and after! In fact, guessing the poet's main point, I fear that the compassionate feeling toward the croaking frogs holds more weight. Because so-called "brazen" can only be interpreted as "bored," and is different from the meaning when we now scold someone for being "brazen." Saying that the croaking frogs around the hut let out bored groans, of course, can be considered a completely critical tone. As for the latter statements that "the body is like a croaking frog, not belonging to the officials," that is not only feeling sympathy for the frogs, but also directly comparing one's self to a croaking frog.</p>
<p>People who live in ivory towers or golden houses are unlikely to have much affection for croaking frogs; however, regardless of whether you feel affection or not, as long as the plum rain season comes, they come out to shout, forming a continuous chorus, not willing to be dull, and noisily cheering. Since ancient times, this has long been an "ironclad fact."</p>

<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>A milky white lightbulb is covered in a layer of dust, weakly emitting a dim ray of light.</p>
<p>On the door, a faded red piece of paper is pasted, on which is written:</p>
<p>"Exclusively serving traveling merchants." "Accommodation fee: one dime per night." There are no attendants, no elevators. Stepping inside, one can see the double-layered wooden beds connected together. On the stiff poplar planks is spread a mat (in the summer). A broken quilt, like a dead snake, is rolled up on one side. The walls are covered with bedbug blood, mixed with a few yellow spots scorched by cigarette butts. In several places, sentences expressing complaints are written.</p>
<p>···Misfortune upon misfortune···Desperate straits···Empty pockets···</p>
<p>···What to do, what to do···Don't laugh at my poverty···Don't look down on me···Eat my old fist···Snobbish dogs···</p>
<p>On the floor, thick phlegm is spat everywhere, sticking to several half-dead bedbugs. Coughing sounds are heard like a string of firecrackers, and sighs and snores mix together.</p>
<p>In this place, there is no peaceful life, only pain and annoyance, like poisonous snakes, gnawing at someone's soul.</p>
<p>The small inn is the dormitory for poor friends who have been squeezed out of big hotels, and it is the headquarters for blood-sucking bedbugs.</p>
<p>▲Correction: In yesterday's publication, "Philippine and Ham," ham was mistaken for [a character meaning foul or fishy]. This must be corrected immediately.</p>

<p>— Huang Juemin</p>
<p>(6) In addition, an airfield was specially built for visitors to take aerial tours. The fee was three yuan for every twenty miles. I had always regretted never having flown in an airplane, so I decided to try it. I felt that the speed of 120 miles per hour was very fast to watch, but seemed very slow when sitting in it. On June 13th, a wireless telegram was received on the President Hoover ship, stating that one of the planes had crashed on the 12th. All eight passengers, five men and three women, as well as the pilot and co-pilot, were burned to death. If I had accepted a friend's invitation to return to China on the President Hoover on June 16th, then the 12th would have been the planned day to tour the World's Fair, and I might have also been in danger. Now that I have been spared from disaster, it is indeed fortunate.</p>
<p>(7) Long-distance telephones were also available inside the Transportation Exhibition Hall. You could call any of the forty-eight major cities in the United States for free. Driven by curiosity, I waited for two hours to get my turn to try making a long-distance call from Chicago to Mr. Chen Jiyi, a classmate at 430 West 24th Street in New York City. Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen was out at the time and I couldn't reach him. Fortunately, the operator allowed me to try another call. I successfully spoke to Mr. Jin Shurong at the Livingstone dormitory of Columbia University for three minutes. I could hear everything Mr. Jin said very clearly, just like making a phone call in New York. However, Mr. Jin could only hear me vaguely, so in the three minutes, I could only ask Mr. Jin to relay to my friends at the Chinese Education Society of Teachers College, Columbia University, that I was using a free long-distance phone at the Chicago World's Fair to send them my regards.</p>
<p>(4) Social Science Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>Here, visitors can see the life of humans living in caves and the wilderness 5,000 years ago, and the initial family conditions of Americans. From oil lamps to electric lights, radios, automobiles, refrigerators, and household appliances, everything is displayed to show the progress of family life. Other social issues, such as the accumulation and distribution of capital, the process of immigration, the development of education, the latest types of housing and how they will be improved in the future, as well as model villages, are presented clearly using charts or models.</p>
<p>The exhibits here focus on the family life of Americans. Upon entering the first floor, visitors immediately see the family life of Americans during the colonial era. Spinning, sewing, gathering firewood, and cooking were all done by hand. Further in, on one side, is a display of American rural life, such as churches, schools, horse-drawn carriages, and neighborhoods. On the other side, you can see a huge building in the city in 1933 that can house dozens or hundreds of families. Urban life is also very different from rural life. Factories, schools, parks, playgrounds, entertainment venues, flower paths, automobiles, trains, radios, airplanes, etc., are all available for people to enjoy.</p>
<p>Further in, you see a section of an ancient cave from 50,000 years ago, brought from Europe and displayed. It is slightly similar to the caves built by Native Americans in central Illinois.</p>
<p>Next, you see an animated film. It shows the rapid increase in the population of immigrants coming to America, and the resulting problems of transportation, housing, schools, crime, race, and health, as well as how the government solves them, so that people know that the money they pay in taxes to support the government actually yields many times more in return.</p>
<p>Outside the hall, but still belonging to the social science section, is a model of the thousand-year-old Mayan temple, a village of American Indians, and the Lama Temple of Jehol in China. (Picture 2)</p>

<p>Chapter 11: Bowing in Agreement to Marriage, Deep Concern for the Soldiers, a Joyous Atmosphere</p>
<p>Tian Qing laughed: "You must be missing your wife terribly, right? Why are you so angry?" Zhao Ziqiang shook his head and said: "I'm not joking. If I had any other way, I wouldn't be holding a gun. I heard that the Commander-in-Chief is coming for inspection, so all the battalions are desperately replenishing their ranks. My company has replenished twenty brothers, but damn it, none of them are worth a damn. Not to mention anything else, after teaching them for two weeks, they still can't even handle the household registration book." (Note: A soldier's three-generation resume is called a "household registration book" in military slang, also called a "roster.") Tian Qing laughed: "My company is slightly better, but there are still one or two useless guys. Don't be impatient, just teach them slowly." Zhao Ziqiang said: "I have no patience left. I listened to you and didn't hit them, because hitting them will make them lose face, but..." As he was saying this, two new recruits happened to pass by the window, raising their hands in salute. Zhao Ziqiang said: "Come in, I want to ask you something." The two soldiers walked to the door and stood at attention. The one in front was tall, with a dark face, but with a pair of pale eyes. Zhao Ziqiang said: "You are the worst. Don't panic, slowly recite your household registration book. Just treat it as a normal conversation, don't lie. What is your surname and what is your name?" He said: "My name is Da Ge'er Li (Big Guy Li)." Tian Qing, standing behind, couldn't help but burst out laughing. Zhao Ziqiang turned his head and frowned at Tian Qing, saying: "Listen to him, what will I do if the Commander-in-Chief checks him during the inspection?" That Da Ge'er, straightened his body, rolled his eyes, and couldn't say a word. Zhao Ziqiang coughed and said: "When you were pulling rickshaws outside, you were called Da Ge'er Li, but are you still called Da Ge'er Li now that you're a soldier? Have the platoon leader and squad leader been talking to a log for the past two weeks?" Da Ge'er Li said: "Platoon... what do you call him?" He said: "My name is Li Changfa." Tian Qing couldn't help but interrupt: "Don't add that 'la' character." Zhao Ziqiang nodded and said: "Just make do with it. Who is your guarantor?" He said: "My guarantor is Zhang Sande." Zhao Ziqiang said: "Where are you from?" "I'm from Jinan Prefecture, Shandong." "How old are you?" "Twenty-nine years old." "Who is your grandfather?" (129)</p>

<h3 id="e264">On Entertainment <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I accidentally heard a poor friend say that he wanted to sell a manuscript to buy a phonograph. At the time, I was a little surprised. I thought, to sell one's own hard work to buy an unimportant entertainment item, isn't that crazy? Is listening to Dr. X's "Farewell My Concubine" or "Su San Starts Her Journey" more important than eating? My poor friend is like this, so those brothers who don't have to sell manuscripts and still have food to eat certainly won't ignore the true meaning of entertainment in life.</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, entertainment has been given a much higher status. It is said that entertainment is not only enough to make people laugh and feel happy, but it can also save the country. From this, we can see that entertainment is indeed comparable to "chanting scriptures" and other things. However, China's chronic illness is too deep. Although there is such a wonderful way to save the country, it still inevitably allows loyal comrades of the rebellious party to establish a "puppet state," and it is said that the "East China Republic" is also in the works. From this point of view, it has failed the lonely and painstaking efforts of those who advocate entertainment to save the country, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>However, those who believe that entertainment has the miraculous effect of saving the country are smart people who deeply understand the truth of entertainment. They have studied this path extremely thoroughly throughout their lives. Take dancing, for example. They know which dance hall is the most luxurious. They fully understand where it is suitable to open a dance hall for a country-saving entertainment show, and where it is suitable to hold a coronation ceremony for a movie queen. As for which is Mei Lanfang's signature play, which star is the Hollywood queen of 1933, and who is this year's president of the flower country (probably changed to chairman in order to adapt to the times), they naturally know them all like the back of their hand, knowing everything and understanding everything.</p>
<p>It is very clear that entertainment is limited to playboys or masters, mistresses, and young ladies, because only these outstanding people have the full possibility of entertainment. They have money and time, and they have energy and interest. They cannot be excited without entertainment, and they cannot live without entertainment. They deeply understand the essence of this, and they feel that in the Three Principles of the People of saving the country and saving the people, it is necessary to add a clause of entertainment. In short, current enter</p>
<p>tainment is completely popular for this group of high-class Chinese. Just looking at the suits worth hundreds of yuan and the cheongsams of 1933 style crowded in front of the Great Light Gate can prove the urgency of this group for entertainment. As for friends who work hard all day and can't afford two dimes to watch Luo Ke drive fast, they can only wear straw sandals and wave palm-leaf fans, standing in groups in front of foreign goods stores listening to the ten-teaching songs of the "hee hee" and "ha ha" radio broadcasts. Besides this, what other opportunities do they have for entertainment?</p>
<p>It seems that more articles can be written on this topic, but I have to stop here today.</p>
<h3 id="e265">The Entrance to the Swimming Pool <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangyun</p>
<p>"Old Zhang! Forget it, let's come again tomorrow!" A-Yun was so crowded that he couldn't even breathe, and the front was still piled with dense crowds of people; he despaired and said to his companion who was squeezed in front of him, gasping for air. Beads of sweat dripped from his greasy forehead.</p>
<p>This was the entrance to the swimming pool on the edge of the road going to Jiangwan. The sun was in the blue sky, releasing the heat of 97.7 degrees on the thermometer.</p>
<p>"There's no way, even if we want to go back now, we can't. It's better to squeeze forward hard!" Old Zhang turned his head and said, and then continued his work.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, it's half a dollar for one person, and there are so many people!" A-Yun looked at the situation and knew that it was not easy to go back. So he began to mutter, "The beggars on the road, hearing 'Old Master' this and 'Madam' that, don't even want to give them a penny!..."</p>
<p>The turnstile was constantly calling. Men and women were struggling to be rolled in one by one. The sound of buying tickets, the sound of shouting, the sound of snoring... combined, they just spread into the room.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang! You go buy the tickets first!" Old Zheng, a small man who was pressed so hard behind A-Yun that even his shadow couldn't be seen, said, straining to grab A-Yun's shoulders and standing on tiptoe.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Old Zhang squeezed forward even harder. Like charging into battle.</p>
<p>"Hey! Buy one ticket!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Ticket, one dollar!"</p>
<p>Old Zhang had gradually squeezed closer. Raising his hand and stretching it forward, there was a dollar in his palm. He began to shout.</p>
<p>A-Yun and Old Zheng followed behind the people and crowded up. The number of people in front of them gradually decreased. Finally, they received the tickets handed over by Old Zhang and were rolled in.</p>
<p>"Ah! There are so many people on Sundays!" Old Zhang smiled and said to them when he saw that they had all entered.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, even bank runs don't look like this!" A-Yun said, wiping his sweat and humming with anger.</p>
<p>"Never mind it, let's quickly go change our clothes!" Old Zheng said resentfully.</p>
<p>Lovers in front of the Grand Theatre, the aroma of incense, the Grand Theatre cinema</p>
<p>Lifting their feet and taking steps, they ran towards the changing room, with bright eyes showing happy smiles.</p>
<h3 id="e266">The Suffering of the People <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, I left Shanghai and returned to Sichuan, staying in the interior for about half a year. There is nothing worth mentioning about my uneventful life, but I gained a deeper understanding of the suffering of the people in the interior. The following "Song of the Old Farmer" is based on real events, but I am not eloquent enough to express their grief and indignation even by a ten-thousandth. However, it can also be seen how the people of Sichuan suffer. The skill or clumsiness of the poem is not what matters. "The sky is like fire north and south of the Yangtze River, the fields are covered with clouds of sorrow. Ten thousand wells are abandoned to seek new springs, the old farmer sadly weeps before me. I am heartbroken and secretly shed tears, bearing the sorrow and feigning joy to face the old man. The old man said, 'Let us sit in this forest and talk about the past and present. I remember when I was young, the customs were pure and beautiful, and life was happy. It would rain every five days and be sunny for ten days, and the four regions were prosperous and had surplus money. In recent years, the weather has changed, and the warlords' sins fill the mountains and seas. Taxes have been collected for fifty years, and the Republic has been around for twenty years. Merchants' business is slow, and fundraising amounts to more than ten million. There is a reason for the tax names, one just finished, another starts again. Repeated wars harm the good crops, making it difficult to sow in the spring and difficult to harvest in the autumn. Farmers dare not use their plows, and the fields are mostly barren. The lives of workers are even more miserable, and they are also "drafted" into military service. Husbands leave their wives and fathers leave their sons, and every family inevitably cries. On weekdays, warlords suppress all sides, confiscating school funds as they please, robbing students and raping women, openly and blatantly. This year's civil war in Chongqing and Luzhou, shooting recklessly regardless of consequences? They also extort ship taxes and donations, destroy cities and burn houses. The warlords are truly heartless, truly powerful and unjust, truly killing people like eating, truly treating civil war like a game. Pitiful people suffer, not distinguishing west from east in the middle of the night. The wandering souls are hazy and the sky is dark, and the wronged blood stains Sichuan red. Even more pitiful is my son, who is always sick, but is called away by the landlord to deliver a message. He only gets a few hundred coins in wages, but loses his life for no reason. Now the land is very dry, there has been no rain for three months and the ditches are empty. After the winter grain is finished, everyone complains, running around to make a living. Suddenly, the sky opens and the sun is at its noon, crawling to the mansion of the rich and powerful, bowing and begging outside the gate, thousands of cries of bitterness and ten thousand cries of bitterness. Who would have thought that the rich and powerful are too vicious, giving no rice and no tea, preferring to feed the yellow dogs with leftovers rather than saving our lives. My seven-year-old grandson's life hangs by a thread, his clothes are torn and his hair is stained with mud, his feet are bare and cold and he cannot walk, calling to the heavens but no one answers, and his mother does not know. Last night, lightning broke the distant mountains, and the electric light flickered and opened the face of the sky. We were happily arranging to weed, but then hail fell and filled the fields. Disasters are coming in droves at the beginning of summer, only adding to the price of rice for the rich and powerful, making a bucket of rice worth ten thousand coins already unbearable, let alone their extravagant desire to be cunning. The seedlings are all lost and green, and the living family is re-planning to drift away, but they are worried about not paying the rent and taxes, and will inevitably sit in the yamen in the future. Sir! Sir, now you know how hard it is to farm, it is better to have money and be happy. It is most difficult to have a bumper year in farming, but with money you can buy high rank. The other day I met a high official in the city, surrounded by guards in beautiful clothes, possessing millions of wealth in an instant, and eating white rice for all "three meals". The brocade curtains shone brightly in the sky, with four or five concubines serving him, all enjoyed because of money, how can it be compared to our suffering?' When I heard the old man's words, my heart was</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>pounded, I tried to persuade the old man to stop his worries. There is nothing to be done in this evil society, but we must strive to eliminate the demons. Descend the demons, with a bang, jump out of this dirty village, save the people, otherwise in the future, our China, the rich and the powerful will oppress even more, please see their satin robes, dyed with the blood of the weak and small. My words, the old man remembers, if the old man does not hear, there was Turkey a few years ago, suffering internal devastation and external oppression, after a national revolution, the people are happy like this, and do you not hear, China now has a revolutionary army, resisting Japan and saving the country to protect the people, although the goal has not yet been achieved, you will soon see the light, the old man's heart began to widen when he heard these words, Yang Chang left and the road was vast,</p>

<p>Mr. Editor;</p>
<p>I previously sent a letter to you asking for your esteemed guidance on the question of "What is the purpose of living in this world?" Yesterday, I read the Shop Assistant Correspondence column in the Shen Bao supplement and saw that the original letter and the answer were published together, which made me very happy! The reply was concise and to the point, and only someone who deeply understands the underlying problems of the current society could achieve this. The layered explanation of the meaning of the word "life" was particularly insightful and unique. However, this question was previously answered by Mr. Ye and Mr. Wei, who said, "The purpose of living in this world, in the final analysis, is to eat." I believe that eating is one of the means to continue survival, not the purpose of life. Now, after the esteemed</p>
<p>Mr.'s answer, "The purpose of living in this world is the word 'life'." Explaining survival with survival seems to be incomplete. It should be known that my asking this question was to pursue the ultimate purpose of life. Because when a person is born, the conditions for life are already in place, and after that, it is only necessary to continue to maintain their survival. Maintaining survival is the right of life, and the essential condition for continuing life. As for the essence of life, it must be elsewhere. I am dull-witted, wandering all night, thinking again and again. Finally, I have a slight clue. I will now reveal it as follows; I sincerely hope for the most guidance, so that the complete answer to this question can be published to the world.</p>
<p>Life is a process of struggle, and the continuous struggle of mankind has created a history of social evolution. If there were no human struggle, then mankind would have been swallowed up by floods and wild beasts long ago, and how could there be today's society? Then today we would still be living in caves and the wilderness, eating raw meat and drinking blood. From the creations of the ancient sage kings to the inventions of modern scientists, all are sufficient to represent the bravest fighters of society. The achievements they have left to us are extremely great! However, although we ordinary people may not have invented amazing technologies in society, we are not completely without contribution or benefit to society: those who are wise and perceptive, create in the front, must rely on those who are perceptive later to execute in the rear. Carrying on the past and starting the future is the responsibility of ordinary people like us, and it cannot be shirked. From the sage kings, virtuous ministers, philosophers, and scholars, to farmers, workers, merchants, and students, peddlers and porters, what they have been engaged in throughout their lives, not neglecting day and night; all are for creating society, promoting civilization, and making a long-term struggle to the death. This kind of fighting spirit, from the reproduction of the nation, is passed down to thousands of generations and no one can replace it. The Book of Changes says: "Strive for self-improvement." Today we say: "Strive hard," although the names are different, they are all the fundamental trends of mankind from birth, not because of different countries, not because of different times. The father passes it on to the son, and the son passes it on to the grandson, thus creating today's solemn and brilliant universe and the record of mankind. Therefore, I say: "Life is a process of struggle"; "What is the purpose of living in this world? To struggle", "Struggle is the fundamental trend of mankind from birth, and therefore there is today's society and today's civilization". A foolish idea, I dare to question</p>
<p>Mr., if I am fortunate enough to be taught further, then I will be even more fortunate. I hereby send this letter and wish you</p>
<p>Teachi Liu Xingchuan respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Struggle is a means, not an end. Without a purpose, there is no struggle. To see someone kill someone, to beat someone you meet, what meaning is there? There must be a purpose, and then attacking the characters who obstruct me from achieving my purpose, then there will be success and meaning. This world has always been a world of competition, not only human beings, but all other animals and plants are constantly in the process of competition and struggle. But what is the purpose of their struggle? Many people often can't say this question. We only need to examine the results of their struggle, and it is not difficult to understand. "Survival of the fittest", this is the result of struggle. Therefore, we can clearly see that the purpose of struggle, or the purpose of life, can be said to be "survival".</p>
<p>The first condition for survival is eating. Therefore, Liu Jun's letter on July 7th introduced the opinions of Mr. Ye and Mr. Wei, saying "The purpose of living in this world, in the final analysis, is to eat." This sentence can of course be said to be "hitting the nail on the head." However, the two words "eating" are very different; when there is no food to eat, we only seek to have food to eat; when we have food to eat, we can't help but want to eat good food or easy food. So if "eating" is the only purpose of life, then being driven by this kind of "bottomless" desire will create a cruel and terrifying world of you robbing me.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that after we have food to eat, after we can survive, we must take "what kind of life is meaningful" as the purpose; we should no longer plunder the necessary materials for others' lives to supply my own enjoyment. What we call "living meaningfully" does not refer to the kind of idealism that many dead people used to say, such as "establishing merit and establishing a career", "making a name for oneself for eternity", "honoring ancestors", and "bestowing wives and sons". What we advocate is mutual aid. People who have no food to eat have the right to ask for help; rich people have the obligation to help others.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Jiangbei person, traitor, don't even think about denying it..." A louder voice drowned out the worker's cries.</p>
<p>A fellow secretly took out a small paper packet and slipped it into the worker's pocket in the hustle and bustle. Only Changfa, standing beside him, saw this action clearly, and he secretly praised his subordinate's agility, good fellow!</p>
<p>"I am...I am a worker...I am fighting against the Japanese!"</p>
<p>"Beat him, beat the traitor!"</p>
<p>"Beat him to death!"</p>
<p>"What a traitor!"</p>
<p>The police finally heard the surge of the crowd and one pointed a gun at the worker's chest.</p>
<p>"Beat him! Grab him!"</p>
<p>The worker, panting, his face covered in blood, tried to explain himself!</p>
<p>"It's a real injustice, I work in the Japanese-owned yarn factory, we don't help the Japanese work, we are on strike. They wrongly accuse me of being..."</p>
<p>Another tall man who looked like a worker pushed his way in...</p>
<p>"It's really an injustice, he's from the XX yarn factory...I know him, we all walked out because we refused to work for the Japanese."</p>
<p>A policeman pushed him aside...</p>
<p>"We'll search him."</p>
<p>Sure enough, they found it, taking a paper package from the worker's body.</p>
<p>That pale face showed no surprise, his eyes widened: how could this thing be in my pocket? Suddenly, he shouted:</p>
<p>"This is outrageous, who put it in my pocket..."</p>
<p>The paper package was opened, revealing: several Japanese coins, a chicken feather, a piece of cloth, and the barely legible characters "Jiangbei Headquarters", heaven knows, there was even a sun-shaped stamp on it!</p>
<p>The tall worker also knew he had been framed and shouted:</p>
<p>"This is an injustice, I can swear to the heavens today, he is indeed a worker from XX...someone is framing him..."</p>
<p>"This one must be a traitor too!" Changfa immediately shouted, and many fellows followed suit:</p>

<h3 id="e270">"Mmmmmmm"? <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Xi</p>
<p>This is a new term from Hollywood</p>
<p>The new trend for modern women</p>
<p>Film fans, do you know? Hollywood has invented another new word! This word is "Mmmmmmm". How should this word be explained? If you string together seven (or a few more, it doesn't matter) M's, you can understand it. I am now translating this word as "唔丨丨丨". This "唔" is pronounced with an N sound. Although the sounds of M and N are quite different, one with closed lips and the other with open lips, when you see a woman's body and feel admiration that cannot be expressed in words, foreigners</p>
<p>say "Mmmmmmm" and Chinese people say "Nnnnnnnn". This is a very natural exclamation. Now I'm translating it as "唔丨丨丨", which should not be too far off.</p>
<p>What exactly is this "唔丨丨丨"? Some say it's a variation of "It". "It" with a little more flesh becomes "Mmmmmmm". Originally, Clara Bow was a muscular and plump "It girl", but now that she has returned from Europe, her waist has gained another inch, and she has become a modern Mmmmmmm girl. There is also a Miss Mae West, who is now a sexy (M Ses appeal) star. Of course, she has a firm grasp of this modern Mmmmmmm. So we can say that the fashion of women's bodies, since a busybody found "It" in Clara Bow, later there was an even more busy person, who generalized it, transformed it into S.A., so that ordinary women, anyone can have it (not only women, men can also have S.A.); anyone can train it, if they lack it. Now it's good, I don't know which busybody, fearing that the world is at peace, strongly emphasized a kind of S.A. and gave it a new name, called "Mmmmmmm".</p>
<p>The fashion of women's bodies, of course, also has a sense of the times. So a few years ago, when slim waists were emphasized, many stars were afraid of gaining weight. Greta Nissen starved herself for eighteen days to make her body thinner. Now that Mmmmmmm has emerged, women are again emphasizing "abundance with surplus, softness as if boneless". So Greta Nissen, who used to starve herself to slim her waist, is now preparing a lot of sweets, eating them at any time, to make her body grow fatter day by day.</p>
<p>Some say then isn't "Mmmmmmm" just healthy beauty? No. Healthy beauty lies in firm muscles and sufficient blood, while "Mmmmmmm" is something else. It has a moving sex appeal on top of health. Of course, these are two very difficult things to separate, but clever people can easily understand their differences. If we add some sexual temptation to healthy beauty, then it becomes "唔".</p>
<p>But after talking for so long, the author is just telling readers about some new Hollywood trends, and is not advising Chinese actresses to eat more meat, more sweets, and sleep more to make their bodies fatter. To be honest, Mae West is the only fat woman with curves and sex appeal in Hollywood. Moreover, although Mae West's body is fat, she exercises her body every day to prevent her weight from increasing further. Many women see that Mae West is interestingly fat and also want to gain weight, but they may not get the benefits of being fat, but instead become bloated and inconvenient to move.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e271">Review of "The Night Mayor" The Night Mayor <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Recently, film titles have suddenly become popular with direct translations, such as "Eagle Song" and "White Sisters"...and the "Night Mayor" showing at Cathay is also like this. As for whether this is a good phenomenon, it is not discussed in this article, but it is just mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>Hollywood producers are very obviously showing a panic about subject matter. This is something we can observe with a little attention. However, it's definitely not that there are no real subjects, but rather that they are unwilling to find a way out in real social events. So they are most happy to spend money and time on empty stories, directly allowing idle audiences to get empty entertainment in a few hours.</p>
<p>The fictional nature of the story of "The Night Mayor" should be the feeling of every audience member who has seen this film. Since this is the case, we should not pursue its authenticity. However, I always feel that such a story is rather boring.</p>
<p>If someone says that the intention of this film is mainly to satirize certain chaotic bureaucrats, of course, we can see this intention from the beginning of the film to the mayor's clandestine rendezvous with a dancer at a hotel, but in the end, this mayor has to become a virtuous gentleman, so he actually rationally officiates at the wedding for his rival in love, and even at the end leads the citizens in a demonstration parade with the "We Want Beer" sign, naturally indicating support for Roosevelt's policies. As for the dancer being willing to sacrifice the position of the mayor's wife to marry a journalist, saying it's for the mayor's political future, that's even more wonderful. So this is definitely not satirizing the political authorities, but rather the painstaking effort of a slave advising his master. However, the power of this kind of preaching is obviously very weak.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, some may consider that the bright and frivolous style is relatively novel. Regarding this point, we certainly cannot ignore that this style is quite suitable for the plot, but the deliberately exaggerated tension in some scenes inevitably makes people suspect the destruction of the uniformity that every film should have. Lee Tracy's movements are certainly brisk, but some occasions doubly reveal frivolity. As for whether the dignified officials of the United States are so dissolute and unrestrained, it is difficult for us Chinese to understand.</p>
<p>However, the director's petty bourgeois grievances are more or less expressed in this work. His criticism of officials in the first half is indeed a painstaking depiction. The mayor sleeps late and doesn't answer the phone, the mayor's governance is only for unveiling statues, throwing balls for the stadium, giving speeches for boxing matches, and finally officiating at the wedding for his lover, and hooking up with young girls in dance classes. As for putting a rival in love in jail for a woman, sometimes indulging, sometimes arresting, doing whatever one wants, and also saying that the mayor's secretary actually killed someone innocently, this kind of description is truly extremely vicious. At this point, the Chinese audience looks back, I wonder what their feelings are.</p>
<p>Fox Company's great production "Warrior's Husband" starring Elissa Landi, the female lead of "Roman Scandals", is the first major production by Jesse L. Lasky, the former Paramount production tycoon, after joining "Fox". The costumes in the whole film are antique, extremely gorgeous, and are showing in "Nanjing".</p>
<h3 id="e272">Rasputin <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>丨Showing at the Shanghai Grand Theater丨</p>
<p>Who says White Russians have no motherland to protect them? Their motherland is the capitalist countries of the world. This time, two Rasputins, it is said that the censorship result showed no "insult to the Russian Emperor", but finally, due to the opposition of the White Russians, only one German-produced version was publicly screened in the Shanghai Grand Theater in the Chinese concession.</p>
<p>The story is a Russian legend, so there is no need to repeat it here. But in this story, there are many things revealed to us.</p>
<p>We know that the transition from the era of theocracy to the era of monarchy (this is naturally not the stage theorist's, that kind of mechanical lawlessness, at the same time, theocracy and monarchy are sometimes mutually combined.) went through a struggle. Rasputin is a representative of the supernatural, and although the Emperor and Empress are respected as the mother of the nation, they deeply believe in and respect him because their beloved son was treated by him. This shows how much the older generation respects theocracy, which also shows that the monarchy cannot but bow before theocracy. But the younger generation is not like this, he wants to resist, he wants to overthrow this so-called divine power, although the Russian Crown Prince's own illness was cured by Rasputin, he painstakingly planned to murder him, and finally, after the poison cake was ineffective, he followed up with five bullets and killed Rasputin. Doesn't this clearly show that the monarchy has triumphed over theocracy?</p>
<p>Secondly, this film is made with an antagonistic attitude towards "God" (Rasputin). Therefore, not only does it finally show Rasputin's death, but it also exposes Rasputin's debauchery thoroughly. Even his meeting with his old lover, Rosa, is met with a painful beating by her father, resulting in injury on the road.</p>
<p>I don't know how other audiences, or critics, understand this Rasputin. But I always think that the central consciousness of Rasputin cannot be grasped unless it is explained in this way. Because this is not only the consciousness of the film, it is also the consciousness of this legend.</p>
<p>As for technique, the style of German films has always been different from that of Hollywood. It does not have the modernity of Hollywood, so they are very happy to show films about ancient stories. "Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dancing" is like this! "White Demon" is like this; this "Rasputin" is a work in the same style as the aforementioned films. It often has very long shots, expressing a certain point extremely freely: unlike the fast changes of shots in American films, which make people dizzying. As for the use of sound, it is another special feature of Germany. The director tries to pay attention to the coordination of sound and shadow, so that the audience can get the enjoyment of the ears and eyes. The actors naturally have Conrad Veidt as the best. He is very reliable, and also very profoundly expresses the actions and even emotions that the character in the play should have. The others are also competent.</p>
<h3 id="e273">The Secret of the American Garbo <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Kathleen Hepburn, known as the American Garbo, although she has only starred in two films in Hollywood, one "A Bill of Divorcement" and one "A Great Desire", her reputation has surpassed that of general veteran stars in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Since Kathleen has attracted the attention of the masses, many journalists have spent a lot of time asking Kathleen about her background, family situation, and how she entered the art world. However, the American Garbo not only looks like the Swedish Garbo, but also has a similar personality. She is very secretive and keeps her mouth shut about issues such as family situation and background, and never reveals the truth to others. As a result, rumors abound. Some said that Kathleen had several children who were all at home, others said that she had already been married but had no children. Some said that she had a degree from Bryn Mawr College, while others said that she had never been to college. Some even said that she had sixteen million in property, but others said that she had no property and only lived on her salary. Discussions are endless, and it is not known whose words are true.</p>
<p>Later, someone finally found out everything about her. It turned out that Kathleen was from Hartford in the eastern United States. Her father was Dr. Soames Hepburn, who was highly respected, but had no property. She had a total of six siblings, one of whom died, and there are now five. She is the third. She did go to college, studying drama, but did not graduate. She has been married for three years and her husband is a businessman, but she has never had children.</p>
<p>Kathleen's secret has finally been revealed to everyone. Here we can also admire Hollywood's volunteer detectives.</p>

<p>— Si Ying</p>
<p>Karel Konradt took the princess's letter and ran to the prime minister's office to submit the letter to the prime minister. The prime minister opened the letter and read it, feeling ecstatic. It turned out that the princess had agreed to the marriage with Prince Bondenvedulo. The Prime Minister said to Karel, "Congratulations, congratulations, General!" He then ordered Prince Bondenvedulo to set off quickly. The palace also prepared to hold a dance party to welcome Prince Bondenvedulo. The princess regretted it at this time, but it was too late, because the prime minister threatened that if this marriage was stopped halfway, it would definitely cause a war between the two countries.</p>
<p>The day of the dance party arrived. In the vast and gorgeous dance hall, the prime minister led the princess in, surrounded by the wives and children of the ministers, dressed in colorful clothes. After a while, the guards blew their horns, announcing that Prince Bondenvedulo had arrived. The prince was a young invalid, with a dull look, like a zombie crawling out of a grave. The princess seemed very disdainful, raising her head even higher, and reluctantly stretched out her hand to let Prince Bondenvedulo kiss it. The music started, playing the waltz that the princess and Karel had played when they first met that night. The princess said angrily to the prince, "Let's dance." She really couldn't bear it anymore, because Karel stood beside her, staring at the princess with fierce eyes, making her feel ashamed. But the prince didn't dance. When he saw Karel standing beside him, he greeted him and said, "Please represent me, I can't dance, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Is that okay?" Before Karel could finish speaking, he immediately put his arms around the princess, and without waiting for the princess to agree, he started dancing. The prime minister saw that things were not good and immediately stopped him, but Karel and the princess had already squeezed past the crowd. The prime minister squeezed in and out of the crowd, looking for Karel and the princess. At this time, the Emperor arrived, but the prime minister did not know and was still looking for the princess and Karel. When someone pulled him and told him that the Emperor had arrived, the Emperor had already entered. The princess hurriedly went up to greet him, she must see the Emperor this time. The Emperor saw the princess. He asked her, "This sister of yours is so good, she doesn't even come to see me after returning from school. The princess took the Emperor's little hand and comforted him, "Good brother, I have wanted to see you many times, but the prime minister has always stopped me and wouldn't let me see you." The Emperor said angrily to the prime minister: "Good prime minister, I don't need you anymore, you go home!" The Emperor saw that his sister was so beautiful and asked her why no one wanted to marry her? The princess pointed to Prince Bondenvedulo and said, "He wants to marry me." Prince Bondenvedulo felt a little ashamed, and he said to the Emperor, "Our marriage cannot succeed. My heart is already focused on our lovely mummy." The Emperor laughed and said, "Great, you go back and find your mummy!"</p>
<p>The princess put her hands on the Emperor's shoulders and whispered a few words in the Emperor's ear. The Emperor turned around, patted Karel's shoulder, and said to the princess, "How about this person? Are you willing to marry him? I think he should be made a prince."</p>
<p>The princess quickly replied, "Good, good, you should make him a prince." (The End)</p>
