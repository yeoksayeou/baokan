<p>國聯報告書通過大會</p>
<p>日代表單獨投反對票暹代表棄權</p>
<p>根據盟約三個月内不得從事戰爭</p>
<p>松岡表演戲劇式的姿勢</p>
<p>大會未畢率員廢然離塲</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯大會業以四十二對一票、通過十九國委員會提出之報告與建議、聲明反對者僅日代表松岡一人、惟當事國照例不計、故主席宣稱此案已一致通過</p>
<p>今晨國聯大會係十時四十九分開會、歐洲四大國代表、法由總理彭古親自出席、英爲外次艾登、德爲方凱勒、意爲阿樂錫、</p>
<p>當開會時、外交壇坫上中日兩國代表幾居席數之過半、蓋兩國代表團中人悉數到會也、再美俄雖非會員團、亦有人表旁聽、</p>
<p>主席比外相希孟宣讀業已接受邀請參加談判委員會之國名後、即聲稱此項報告足以代表十九國委員本於良心之努力、今日各委員已不欲再有演説、並聲明十九國委員會詳盡考慮日本意見後、對於報告不欲有所更改、</p>
<p>斯時日本總代表松岡則側其首、以一指頣、微露奇異之容、傾聽希孟之言、中國總代表顏惠慶則始終莊重静聆、</p>
<p>最後希孟聲稱、顏博士之聲明、已有草稿分送、將不再譯爲法語、但各代表及新聞記者應之曰［否、］希孟遂命傳譯者譯成法語、　松岡聲稱、顏博士所辯論者、日代表母庸置答、因皆已於意見書中答復故也</p>
<p>顏氏演説聲稱、渠起立致辭時、已有一種沉寃獲伸之感想、因我輩今日乃來判定一重要會員國違犯盟約之罪、可有一種感激之心、因吾國之政策業已受人維持、而大白於天下、敝國人民前十七個月中所遭人類文明史中空前之横暴侵略、亦並非虚受云云、</p>
<p>迨松岡繼起演説、讀畢預先準備之演説稿後、即大呼日本將反對國際共管滿洲之任何企圖、並發狂妄之言、竟謂在權利上滿洲屬於日本　因係日人向俄國奪得、今日之滿洲乃日人所造成等語、最後竟稱、爲遠東和平計與全世界和平計、請諸君勿採用報告云云、</p>
<p>加拿大代表李台爾繼起演説、謂此報告乃一志切保持世界和平而消息詳確、宅心公正之委員會、經審愼考慮後一致之判斷、加拿大曾盡力贊助獲得和平解决之種種努力、對此爭議未嘗有所偏袒、加政府深信在報告書之建議内、將能覓　遠東和平發展之鞏固基礎云云、</p>
<p>委内瑞拉代表蘇梅秦聲稱、自一九三一年以來、遠東及遠西俱有衝突、一若未有國聯盟約之存在者、委内瑞拉在參加表决此報告、甚致不願間接叙述任何先例之可容許延長太平洋兩岸違犯盟約狀態之繼續不止者、</p>
<p>希孟嗣在表决前、先宣讀盟約第十五欵第四·五·六·七·及十項、説明此次表决之重要、尤請會衆注意第六項、又謂日本之否决行爲、將爲全世界所嚴重考慮、報告書中之建議、乃合作解决爭執之一種貢獻、今爲當事國一方所拒絕、該國已决定繼續施行其自已政策、不顧國聯其他會員國之意見、最後並請各國繼續努力、覔得一種人類進步上所必要之解决辦法、</p>
<p>嗣以報告書連建議付表决、當逐一點名詢問贊成或反對時、有十三國缺席或不答復、獨暹邏答稱、［放棄表决權、］當詢至日本時、松岡答［不贊成、］語氣明白而堅定、中國顏代表則答曰［贊成、］語氣不若松岡之鄭重、表决結果、希孟遂宣告一致通過、</p>
<p>表决之後、主席希孟即聲稱、此案在法律上之重要性母待贅述、吾輩竭誠希望當事國雙方目下弗犯一無可補救之行爲、總之、國際解决必須實行、吾輩之解决辦法、必須公平而公正、國聯必繼續實行草創公約者所定之工作云云、主席宣言畢、大會即於下午一時四十八分散會、</p>
<p>大會休會後、秘書長德魯蒙立簽發致美俄兩政府公函、請其儘速答　覆願否參加談判委員會之工作、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>旁聽席滿坑滿谷（日内瓦）　今晨國聯大會開會時、旁聽席中無一虚位、攝製電影者復列於會塲之前、會塲兩廊、其活動之象、實爲前所罕見、人人皆談論日代表將作何戲劇的姿勢、當主席希孟就席時、會塲中人皆作耳語、其如雪之皓首、自其座後玻璃窗中、可以覩之、松岡姗姗其來遲、日總代表松岡在最遲到會數人之列、於十時四十五分步入會場、後隨多數人員、舉止從容、在會塲中似爲最鎭静之一組、</p>
<p>主席宣讀開會詞　十時五十分、希孟振鈴開會、首先宣布報告書之略加修正、規定談判委員會實舉之人數、繼曰、自上屆會議後余曾接中日兩國代表團來文數件、内有日本最近之意見書、諸文業經各會員尤其爲十九特委會審查考慮、茲大會命余作下述之宣言、</p>
<p>［十九特委會各委員審愼考量日本之意］見書後、茲特宣布報告書業經一致秉公通過、其辭句無更改之理由、故十九特委會决定不復再有所云、］</p>
<p>希孟於是請中國總代表顏惠慶博士發表意見、</p>
<p>顏代表首先發言</p>
<p>表示接受報告書顏博士即起</p>
<p>稱、中國之政策已爲國聯所維護、渠深爲忻慰國聯以勇敢之精神、對於一極重要之會員國下一判詞、不直其在</p>
<p>人類文明歷史中最爲狂妄</p>
<p>之侵略行爲國聯今已變爲</p>
<p>更有力而有生氣之機關、</p>
<p>至於特委會之報告書、中有若干遺漏、此乃可爲扼腕者、中國並非對於報告書之各項細則完全同意、但吾人爲兩造之一、未便於此强伸其見解也、查李頓調查團係根據盟約第十一條而組織者、中國後雖請援用第十條與十五條、調查團　然根據一九三一年十二月十日之决議案、解釋其本身使命、是以調查團所偏重者、不在判定已往行爲之責任、但在覓取避免復有此種行爲之方法、今調解努　力旣告失敗、李頓報告書必須以新眼光讀之、特委會報告書之第二章正確而有歷史價顏博士繼言及報告書第三章、證引原文若干節、加以稱讚、並略予批評、旋評論日本所僣奪之權力、謂日本以南滿鐵路爲政府中之另一政府、破壞中國之主權與條約、國聯在中國過渡時期中對於中國表示同情、渠深爲感謝、中國願意公斷、與日本解决關於條約釋義之爭執、而日本則拒絕接受盟約第十二條下之義務、雙方態度實相反焉報告書中關於九一八事件之審定及對於滿</p>
<p>洲國地位切實而正確之結</p>
<p>論、渠對之表示滿意、國聯因此結論、不得不考慮方法以履行盟約第十一條下之義務、務告書認九一八以後之事件、中國不負其責、此種結語、乃對於日本讀武主義及日本政策負責者加以可怖但公允的讞語云、顏博士對於中國中央政府與東三省地方當道劃分權限之宣言、應由中政府於日軍撤退之辦法商妥後宣布之一節、表示同意、顏博士並歡迎美俄加入合作、末稱、中國願投票贊成此報告書、不加保留、但若日本不接受之、則中國遵照盟約第十五條第六節之權利、不受絲毫影鄉云、　松岡狂妄致詞</p>
<p>誣衊我國極盡能事</p>
<p>力倡列强實施共管</p>
<p>顏博士之言論、和綏安閑、松岡繼起發言則論調强硬、令人憤懣、松岡謂日政府已愼重考慮此報告書、决定不能接受之、李頓調查團曾言中國爲危害世界和平之問題、日本處中國與廣大的俄國之側、比較的甚小、二十年來、其鄰國之狀况常令日本深憂而不安、吾人瞻望黑暗之前途、實無一線可令此心復安之眞正光明、十九特委會不了解遠東局勢、與日本在空前環境中之地位、及促成日本行爲之最後目的、中國革命二十年、使其人民備遭禍害、死於戰爭·虐政·匪亂·水災旱荒者、不知幾千萬人、其所受之痛苦、有非</p>
<p>中、久已放棄其主權國之義務、日本於此受害最深、革命以來、全國破裂、滿洲朝代下所謂中華帝國領土、皆不復存於民國、今滿洲已去、而成立獨立邦矣、日本欲與中國合作、使滿洲成和平而有秩序之區域、但中國對於日本此種努力、時常阻撓之、日本自信將始終爲遠東和平秩序與進步之柱石、故在滿注採行堅决之立塲、國聯在最初時期、曾忠實秉公謀取解决但其行爲繼續鼓勵中國採行反抗態度、武装兵士多於他國之一國如中國者、實非一國家、凡動輒破壞國際担任之和平國、非尊重原則之一國、李頓報告書徒有皮相、而關於滿洲人民之性質、尤未有深切之研究、至於十九特委會之報告書、認中國爲無罪、而對於日本多年艱苦之努力、以保持和平、增進治安、爲滿洲人民謀福利者、則不置一詞、試與中國他處相較、滿洲現狀究竟如何、日本固爲維持文明鞏固秩序之大力量也、國聯試考慮李頓報告書最後原則、（此節言中國建）設中之國際合作）豈僅僅遣派專門委員襄助一頺唐政府、即可使中國改變乎、事有逈不若是之簡單者、恐無一大國或數國、願担任此種工作也、渠要求中代表説明中政府願否接受國際共管、渠請顏博士在投票以前、對於此點、有所聲明、國際之眞正努力、適增加時局之糾紛、熱河即其一例、日本絕不煩慮此次衝突之結果、但不願見將來無謂之流血、國聯報告書今影響將使中國發生一種印象、以爲可繼續反抗日本而告無罪、渠敢問美國可允巴拿馬運河爲國際共管乎、抑英國可依國際共管埃及乎、日本欲與中國合作、以植立東亞之和平云、松岡最後數語曰、余虔請諸君依吾人之條件、處分吾人、並信任吾人若不顧吾人之請求、則將鑄成大錯、余請諸君勿通過此報告書云、中日代表發言時、會衆皆静聽之、松岡發言後、尚有代表三人、曾簽名欲在會塲發言會衆乃商榷可否在午餐以前、聽取其議論、並表决此報告書、卒决定請三代表發言、於是加拿大委内瑞拉與立陶宛三國代表相發表簡短繼議論、</p>
<p>加拿大代表台爾繼起發言、謂加拿大政府承認調解之努力旣窮、則十九特委會責當草擬盟約第十五條第四節下之報告書、今提交大會之報告書、實爲熱心維持世界和平之博聞公允委員會一致而鄭重的讞詞、加拿大政府自參加爭議之討論後、即竭力贊助以和平方法、覔取解决之努力、愼避可危及和平解决希望之言行、且對於爭議之事實與性質、不輕下斷語、蓋信漫加評論、成發之過早、轉足妨碍恢復遠東和平所擊的中日良好諒解之共同努力、而使不能奏功也、加拿大政府今於接受此報告書、願對十九特委會之工作表示感慰、爲維持國際條約之完整而施最後有效的之制裁、當基於世界之公論、世界公論曾注視特委會作種種之努力、以求獲、和平解决之可能性、今不得不承認特委會之努力、擲諸虚牝、加拿大政会今信報告書中之建議案、可爲遠東和平發展結實之基礎、渠切望爭議之兩造終能接受此項建議案中所列之制度、就人力之所能、以和解彼此牴觸之主張、今無庸贅述决議之嚴重、國聯會員國必須於今日作之、要知世界對和平解决可能性之信任、今已摇動、如慘澹經營之安全的構造、容人破壞、則莊敬尊重國　國聯要訉轉入第九版</p>

<p>四日登台後、首先施行者、將爲（一）大事更迭駐外代表、（二）國務院與財政部密切協作、在實際上成一最高外交機關、（三）廢止沿用已久之最惠國條欵政策、若輩以爲羅氏原擬任赫爾爲財長、因鑒於今後四年中、大部份外交問題、皆與經濟有關、故任爲國務卿、而赫氏亦因此欲得哥侖比亞大學之摩萊博士爲帮辦國務卿、再伍定之出任財長、亦可視爲財部將協同國務院解决外交問題之明證、因伍定前曾盛傳將派爲駐英大使也、至目前外交問題、除南美與遠東之不宣而戰外、其餘皆屬經濟性質、據稱、羅氏就職後、將立即以最直接與非正式之方法、着手辦理、而各項外交政策、則將由總統會同國務院與財部决定之、現料在羅氏就職後兩月内、即將着手進行之問題計有（一）努力商得各國普减關税、（對於糖另訂關税協定、（二）承認蘇俄（三）解决戰債（四）與各國特别商訂辦法、藉以振興美國對外貿易、至此項辦法、大約即以互惠協定、替代常用之最惠國條欵、（五）勸放棄金本位之各重要國家、回復金本位、（六）謀南美之停戰、及决定遠東政策、（七）加入國際法庭問題之最後决定、又關於駐外代表、梅隆之出任駐英大使、全屬政治關係、將與共和黨政府一同去職、繼任入選、聞將爲路易斐爾驛報發行人平瀚法官、至出席歐洲各重要會議代表、仍以台維斯担任、業已徴得台氏同意矣、</p>
<p>（路透紐約通訊）將來新政府中當以哥崙比亞大學敎授雷門地摩萊氏爲最有實權之一人、雖目前不能决定彼將任何種職務、但可信在下月四號羅斯福就職後、彼仍將爲羅氏之全權顧問之一也、當羅氏選舉勝利後、直至目前、幾不能無日不有摩氏爲之策劃、去年十一月、羅氏在白宮討論戰債時、即以摩萊爲唯一之助手、在三個月前、美國幾無人能知摩萊之名、但今日摩已馳名全國矣、在競選時期中、彼爲羅氏預草演説詞、較之旁人獨多、彼爲一多材之文學家、及詞藻之妙手、並善草動人之文字、故對於羅氏之地位、帮助尤多、在選舉終了後、羅斯福與摩萊博士乃更形親密、現羅氏幾無事不先徴求摩之意見、而摩之主張亦日漸有力矣、顯然以後數年中吾人可常與摩萊之行動及言論相接觸、彼有中人之高度及體重、面部雖黑、但極清潔、目光奕奕、並有令人可親之態度、雖受有高深敎育、但無傲人之氣、現年四十六歲、一九二三年始任哥崙比亞大學政治學助敎、現時則任公法學敎授、彼曾撰著書籍多種、並對政府及政治加以評述、同時並研究犯罪學、在彼之自傳中、彼不肯對自已所信仰之宗敎及政治宣露、羅斯福氏擬請彼加入新政府中、俾在總任期内時與交換意見、摩萊對此、已加允諾、</p>

<p>丨丨復郭子珍君來信丨丨</p>
<p>覆：來書所言關係現在敎育問題者至　鉅，謹就管見所及逐條答復，藉資商榷。（一）這裹包含着兩個重要問題：一個是中國學校敎育的問題，一個是中國家庭問題。這兩個問題或同時並存，或僅存其一，均足使青年一感覺讀書没目趣味，願意謀點事做。］中國的家庭還是承襲手工業時代的大家庭制度，到了現在已經是弊病百出，然大多數尚不能破壞這種組織。大家庭之中，經濟權及一切家事處分權完全操自父母及長兄，子弟没有一點過問之權，尤其是在長兄的權力之下討生活，因爲嫂嫂這一關難過，往往因小叔求學而發生經濟問題的爭議，或避着丈夫專與小叔以難堪，或在枕邊敎浚丈夫，或設法阻撓，在在均足使青年學生灰心，打擊他的求學的興趣。記者此言並不是對於尊府家政有所武斷，不過泛言中國家庭的普遍現象，幸勿誤會。這是一。中國的一部分學校，也和中國的家庭一樣，都是戕折青年的地方。第一是敎授不良。們祗會呌青年一讀死書］［死讀書］們除一次股東會、現正　　貨品、準於三月十二日舉行閉幕典畫、</p>

<p>機聯會播送愛用國貨節曰上海機製國貨工了課本便没有敎育。即此一端，已足使青年變成槁木死灰。况且中國學校的課本又都是禁錮青年思想，戕害青年心理的毒物，青年層之，惡之，厭棄之，正是一種必然的結果，其罪祗在中國的學校，換言之，即中國不良的敎育，而不在青年。記者常言道：［假使你要去考察敎育，你祗要於學］校當局的不經意中，偷偷地跑到他們的敎室旁聽一下、看那個敎員上堂，學生個個都精神百倍，興味盎然的聽着，看着，那這個敎員就是好敎員，他的敎授法和敎材，定民可取：反之，學生十有八九打磕睡，或在那兒偷看小説，那這敎員一定是個飯桶，一定是個陳死人，倒不如乾脆一點，讓他們看小説有益。可惜中國的敎員大半多屬於後者。這裏我們所談的敎育祗是就現在社會社會的立塲言，還不是站在社會主義的立塲説話。足下平心一思你我都是打這種萬惡的學校出來的，這種敎員焉得不令青年喪失他們求學的興趣？以如此之敎育去葬送青年，反不如讓他到邊做做事，或隨他的興趣，夫找一種職業，親自嘗一嘗人生之路的滋味，轉爲有益。（二）若果你眞要［使他改變他的謀事的心］理，繼續求學］，一定要根據我們上邊所説的去研究你們府上的家庭關係與你們貴地的學校敎育，或是力謀改善令弟的家庭的環境與學校的環境，不然没有别的辦法。談到這裏，那又不是一人一家的問題而是社會政治的問題呀。（三）依我們的見解，已如前述，贊成你一允許他的要求，謀點事作］，假使他出自心願的話。不過這也有兩點要注意：果眞他是不滿意於家廠鄉會　云，敬啟言、本會二月十日、　第二次會員代表大會、餘　有畫春山言之　　戲、頗具精彩、其勸國人　國貨、係實協調查動合作、以及提　平長敎育，罪明遵　、淋　盡放，而綫工人敎育之切事掃事、尤爲　·省、閣　公、莫不　善、　如是日適貨　雪、僉晨到塲者不多、盛會難逄、交臂向央、本會深致情驚、　　商請劉君、訂於二月二十五日下午四時至　　假德裕里五十報一　掌情言台、　送看用　　及　導平民敎育節目、尚合貴廠屆時注意　　專此布遜、祇頌公議、</p>

<p>庭的生活與學校的敎育，預備以工兼學，一面做事，一面自修，那個是有志趣的青年，應當竭力成全他。若果因爲看見父兄在外做事有錢用，有衣着，有勢力，有地位，自已眼熱，也想借着父兄的情面，去謀個一官半職，安富尊榮，那就要不得。據我們看來，令弟不是這種人。而是一個有志趣的青年，看他自動的從軍］這一舉便曉得了。至於足下的敎育觀丨這些常識，在學生時代，要由書本裏得到丨我們也不贊成。我們敢斷言，學生時代的常識絕不是由書本得到的，而呈要從他們學校的實際生活與打入社會的奮鬥生活的過程中得來的，書本上的知識是死的知識，無用的知識，明日黄花的知識，從實除生活中得來的知識，才是新鮮而活潑的，有用的知識。在書本上去説軍虞賣國，不如在五四運動中領導學生去反對曹陸章所得到的千分之一·萬分之一的知識：在書本上去説明帝國主義不如在五卅運動中，領導青年的工人學生去反對帝國主義所得到的千发之一萬分之一的知識美國的實騐主義一派的敎育家所號召的敎育也是反對書本上的死敎育，所謂［敎，學，作］三位一體的敎育，這一點是我們通當學的，警如：你要講日本帝國主義的侵略史給你令弟聽，最好讓他到榆關或熱河去參加一次作戰，或到上海來看看淞滬一帶的［一二八］灰燼。先生以爲何如？</p>
<p>某君鑒：函悉。關於宗敎問題，本欄已有糾正，（請參閲廿二日本欄）事屬公開討論，並無攻評某一件之惡意，旣承關注，此後自當格外審愼，此啓。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>中國在最近又接着了兩位外國導師的敎訓，一位是文的，一位是武的。　文的，當然是那位油嘴老翁蕭伯納。他在北平對新聞記者説：中國人的一種奇異的特性，是他們對一切外國人的那種不可思議的客氣和親善，而在他們自已的中間，却老是那麽不客氣，老在打着仗的。他又説，長城是無異於平常的矮墻了。</p>
<p>武的，就是新近攻進熱河來的日本帝國主義者的大砲和飛機。這些大砲和飛機，也在笑着對中國人説：你們中國人對外國人眞客氣，對自已的老百姓眞太不客氣。東三省讓幾千幾萬里，現在這熱河，等你們的戰時公債弄到手，後援慰勞金收集起來之後，少不得又要退讓的。長城一道，本來是築以防外國的來侵的，現在却作了外國人的堡壘和界綫，總算是中國人替外國人費力築成的防禦工事了。</p>
<p>一面想起在所謂國難期中的山東，四川，貴州的戰爭，眞不得不令人佩服，佩服這兩位外國導師的敎訓的確切。末了，我只好來抄兩句改兩句舊詩，以表彰我大中華民族的進步。</p>
<p>改詩經：兄弟鬩於墻，外迎其侮。</p>
<p>抄人嘲李鴻章翁同和詩：幸相合肥天下瘦，軍機常熟庶民荒。</p>
<p>改昔人咏長城詩：秦築長城比鐵牢，當時城此豈知勞，可憐一月初三夜，　白送他人作戰壕。</p>
<h3 id="c28">故鄉 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>像每個在外面飄流的人都有他自椽　　已的故鄉一樣，我也有着一個自</p>
<p>已的故鄉。</p>
<p>我的故鄉旣不是什麽名城，也不是什麽勝地，反之，它只是一個僻静的小小的村莊。三面重重的被長白山的餘脈包圍着，另一面臨近着驛馬河。這是一個不甚大的谷口，也是一個不太小的平原，有山，有水，有豐厚的土田，使它成爲一個很好的農塲，使它的一向被附近的農民們羡慕和頌揚。</p>
<p>在冬天和春天，田塲上，山巓上，全舖着一層厚厚的白雪，河水也結着一層厚厚的堅冰。春末的時候，雪漸漸化了，冰漸漸消了，各處露出了黄黄的草，然後，綠芽冒出來了，滿山滿谷以及廣綿的平原，盡是悦人的綠色；接着，柳絮飛颺，該開始播種了，這時候，田地上有無數的人耕種，山野間開着各種顏色的花；隨後天氣暖了，熱了，一直到秋天，收割，又冷了，又是多天了，丨這是一年裏的氣節。人們隨着自然的轉變，平静的，各自做着自已的工作，這樣的生活，一天一天的過下去，已經有九十多年了。</p>
<p>但近年來，一切情形顯然和從前有些不同了。譬如説：地租加多，捐税增重，鬍匪時常搶刦，物價一年比一年昻貴，並且士産的東西漸漸的減少，最後終至於絕跡；用的東西全是洋貨；一年中收獲的農産品，售銷後非但不像從前一樣可以積存一些錢，反而弄○異常困苦，…………這些，縱然人們不知道是怎麽一回事，也不細想是什麽原故，但毫無疑問的，他們的生活，已經由穩定中墮入到莫明其妙的困苦中了。我的故鄉，雖然只是個僻静的村莊，也終於逃不出這農村破滅的一般現象。</p>
<p>可是，單單是這樣，那他們還是可以靠着自身的勞動艱難地活下去的：如今呢？如今是什麽都完了，他們就連困苦的生活都不能過下去了。可憐的故鄉，現在已經全部滅亡了；在日本帝國主義的飛機大砲之下·焚燬了，燒盡了，房舍，田園，人畜與財物全没有了，現在只剩下一片殘燬的廢墟。啊丨金家屯，我親愛的故鄉丨倘然還有一天我能回到你的懷裏，我要到什麽地方去找尋我故居的遺跡呢？</p>
<h3 id="c29">野蠻種族中的掠奪婚姻 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 李劍風</p>
<p>掠奪婚姻跟着人類文明的進步已漸　漸减少了，但在還未開化的野蠻部落間，此風仍舊盛行着。</p>
<p>美洲的印第安族今日還到處表演着這種悲喜劇。這些部落間時常發生戰鬥：巴達哥尼亞的騎馬的印第安人與駕獨木舟的印第安族，常有個人與個人間的戰鬥，部落與部落間的戰鬥，戰勝的時候把男子殺死，把女子刦去。在這兩個部落稍北的亞馬若和奥里洛哥的部落，除了一部份受着基督敎感化之外，其餘都還在不斷地互相爭鬥，常把對方的女子捕來做生育兒女之用。加里布地方的印第安人則分爲許多小部落或家族團，每部落或每團的人數約爲四十至五十。這些部落每因語言不同，被此不能了解而起衝突，戰勝的那族，不特大事屠殺，而且要把殺死的人拿來充饑呢丨不過這些被殺的，被吃的，都是男子，至於女子，則照例被保留着帶回去做老婆。　澳洲的野蠻社會中，這種掠奪婚姻的風氣比較上述各地更加利害，並且掠奪的方法也更加殘酷。因爲澳洲男子多於女子，各部落間的男子簡直很少得着性的滿足的，他們需要女性時，唯一的方法祇有掠奪。他們常是暗中窺伺着自已所愛的女子的動静，等那女子不提防時，突然跑去用棍子把她擊暈，然後扭着她的頭髮把她拖到附近的森林中，等她神智恢復時，逼着她一同到他家裏去實行他們所謂夫婦生活。而女子的家族對於這種殘酷行爲也竟毫不感到憤恨，因爲他們也是一樣的，機會到了，也會向别人家的女子實行同樣的暴行的。　讀者看了上面這些話也許會很驚詫罷，但這都是一些野蠻民族，還情有可原：假如我告訴你現在最新的國家如蘇聯也還有這種習慣存在，那不更要把人嚇倒嗎？原來俄國有一部份高加索人種，到今還把這樣的結婚看做家常便飯。他們常於夜間把女子搶去放在馬上，假如被人追着，那麽馬，武器一切都被没收；假如成功了，那麽新娘子便跟着他一塊兒過活。愛斯多尼亞以北的勒慈人和烏赤克人裏面也流行着這種刦掠婚姻。最有趣味的是烏赤克人，他們每每乘着女子的父母在田裏工作，或在房裏睡覺的時候，把女子搶去。</p>
<p>掠奪婚姻全憑男子片面意志把一個女子抓來滿足自已的慾望，至於女子的愛情，趣味以至性的慾望如何，是完全不管的，這可説是一種最野蠻最殘酷的婚姻形式。在二十世紀的今日，還有掠奪婚姻存在，實可説是人類的恥辱！</p>

<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>［腦子！］那近視眼説，仿彿他幾乎不能相信自已的耳朶似的。［你一定是非常無知的少女］呵。你没有知道科學家從頭到脚全是腦子麽？］</p>
<p>［這話説給　魚去聽罷，］黑女孩子説。［你再告知我。你可曾考慮過在别人的精神和特性］上，你的實騐的效果麽？爲要發見關於狗的口涎的什麽道理，喪失了你自已的靈魂敗壞了其他一切人的靈魂，這難道是值得的麽？］</p>
<p>［你説的是没有意義的話啦，］那近視眼説。［你能够在手術檯上或解剖室裏證明你稱爲靈］魂的這器官的存在麽？你能够在實騐室裏重做你稱爲敗壞的這一種手術麽？］　［用了我的］［諾勃凱黎］敲一下，我能够使有着靈魂的活體轉變爲没有靈魂的死體的，］黑女孩子説。［那麽，你就可以看見那差異，而且辨别到牠了。當人們做牙惡的事以敗壞他們的］靈魂的時候，你也就看見那差異了。］</p>
<p>［我是見過人的死的；我從未見過人敗壞着自已的靈魂，］那近視眼説。</p>
<p>［然而你却見過他落到畜生道去呢，］黑女孩子説。［你自已是落到畜生道去的，可不是麽］　［好一句惡駡，一句極端地攻擊個人的惡駡］那近視眼傲慢地説。［我離開你了］</p>
<p>於是他顧自去了，一路儘想着使狗爬樹的法子，以便用科學來證明他自已能够爬樹；黑女孩子也顧自走着對向的路，直走到一座小山旁邊，在那小山的頂上豎着一個巨大的十字架，由一個拿着長槍的羅馬兵守護着。原來，那敎士，那在釘十字架的恐怖裏發見了和她在使自已又使情人們心碎這一種事上所發見的同樣希奇的喜悦的敎士，雖有她的一切敎訓，那黑女孩子却憎惡着十字架，以爲耶穌不是完滿了天年和知慧，平安地無痛苦地死去，因而不能保護他的孫女們（他想像着，耶穌至少該有二十個有希望的黑孫女），以防禦他們父母的自私和暴虐，這是非常可惜的。因此，她顯着嫌惡的表情，從那十字架轉過頭去，正在這時候，那羅馬兵掄着長槍向她撲來猛喝道，［黑奴，你在羅馬的正義，羅馬的法律，羅馬的秩序和］</p>
<p>羅馬的和平，等等的象微和器械的前面，跪下來罷。］</p>
<p>然而那黑女孩子却避開了那長槍，將她的［諾勃凱黎］很得勁地向他的後頸上揮去，這一揮就使他一交跌下去，再也不能將他的兩腿把穩到可以扖起來了。［這就是黑奴的器械和那一］切優美的東西的象徴呀，［黑女孩子説，一面將］［諾勃凱黎給他看。［這你可喜歡麽？］［唉唉］！］那兵呻哹了。［好漢吃了黑雌狗的虧！世界的末日到了。］於是他住了掙扎，横倒地上，便小孩子似的哭了。</p>
<p>她没有走得多麽遠，他就復原了；然而他是羅馬兵，不能離開他的哨位，來逞他的感情的。在那小山的崖邊遮斷他們彼此的視線以前，她最後所見的他的光景是他的拳頭向她揮着，至於她最後所聽得的他的話呢，那是用不着在這裏來重述的。</p>
<p>她那下一回的經歷是在一口井的旁邊，她在那裏停下來喝水，忽然看見先前自已不會注意到的男子正坐在那旁邊。她正要用手掬起些水來的時候，他從不知什麽地方端出了一隻杯子，便説道。</p>
<p>［拿了去喝罷，記念我。］</p>
<p>［謝謝，先生］她説，便卽喝了。［多謝你。］</p>

<p>（八）晚清之翦辫運動</p>
<p>男子垂辮髮如廠尾，女子纒小脚稱金蓮，　歐美人十初見如此奇形怪狀之中國人，莫不以爲詫異，或且訕笑鄙夷之，此清季翦辮放足之説所由起也。翦辮運動，發軔於留學生與華僑，内地新學之士，亦多效之。留學生有革命思想者往往翦辮，華僑而不願回國者亦翦辮，清廷始雖禁之，終亦無如之何。章太炎有獄中贈鄒容一詩：</p>
<p>鄒容吾小弟，被髮下　洲。</p>
<p>快翦刀除辮，乾牛肉作喉。</p>
<p>英雄已入獄，天地亦悲秋。</p>
<p>臨命須摻手，乾坤祇兩頭。</p>
<p>此詩不入章氏叢書，僅見於三十年前之浙江潮匕號。蓋章氏論文，以魏晋爲宗，卑視齊梁以下，故集中無近體詩，今有此詩，彌可珍異。詩中寫彼與鄒容之氣概，最足以代表當日之所謂革命英雄，而此等英雄之惟一特徴，即在能用［快翦刀除辮。］宣統二年，前使美大臣伍廷芳奏請翦髮不易服一摺，略謂；奉使美洲，接晤華僑，見其翦截辮髮，改易西装，十恒八九；間有未經翦截者，亦復高蟠頂上，深藏固閉，惟恐人知。咸稱辮髮下垂，屢被外人訕笑，甚且加以種種不美之名，有時竟爲婦孺所謔弄。而其不便作事，污垢衣裳，尤蒙訾毁。况機器製造，廠肆林立，因辮髮而陷於危險者，時有所聞。又謂：目見歐風東漸以來，内地居民，除官紳外，凡學生士女，工賈商農，其因求起居便利，而翦去長髮者，所在而有。同屬一國之民，同居一國之内，而異装殊製，判若楚越，此誠地球萬國所罕聞，抑亦覘國採風者之所詫怪也。况將來風氣日新，其數只有加無减，雖嚴法厲禁，亦勢有所不能，所謂變亦變，不變亦變也。何如自爲變之，而尚有以鼓上下作新之氣乎？奏入不報，逾年而有廣州三月二十九日之變，黨人固多週難，而黄花岡叢葬中，容有非黨人而翦辮者在也。當時香港華服翦辮會，人數逾萬，皆惴惴然不自安，莫不視廣州爲畏途矣。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨剪開鐵橋丨</p>
<p>橋與老人的關係，維都知曉有一位圯上墮履的黄石公，這般爛熟　的故塵當然無複述的必要。現在，提起的不是故事而是今事，橋呢，不是圯上面是鐵橋，老人呢，不是黄石公老人而是黄偉老人：橋與老人的關係呢，不是黄石公老人在橋上墮履，而是黄偉老人在橋上剪繩。</p>
<p>新橋開車的剪繩　，和新輪下水的擲瓶禮有同樣的重要：所不同的，擲瓶禮適用紅顏女子，而剪繩禮却又適用白首老翁。廣州市新舉行耆英會，年在百齡者二人，男性爲黄偉，女性鄧黄氏頗受地方人士相當的敬仰。近因興築二年餘之海殊鐵橋，已於本月十五日行開車禮，由承築該僑之馬克敦公司製成金剪刀一把，以供開橋剪繩之用；另由社會局函請耆英中年齡最高而又子孫繁衍之黄偉老人持刀行剪繩禮。旅又由黄偉以次十四位老人引導過橋，軍政各要人隨之而行，同時奏樂鳴砲，昭告禮成，這眞是空前的盛舉啊。</p>
<p>自從打倒老朽的呼聲一高，［人老珠黄不值錢，］當然人人公認爲落伍人物：廣東舉行耆英會，又請百齡老人做那過橋的先導者；一般老頭兒老婆子大出風頭，説得好，是敬老序齒，説得不好，是打動着時代的倒輪。</p>
<h3 id="c33">橡皮線 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨留心拉斷丨</p>
<p>章太炎，馬湘伯二氏的聯合宣言裏　説，日本的橡皮線，應縮出高麗　。［橡皮綫］三字，用得很有意義。</p>
<p>男男女女，老老少少，凡是不紥褲脚的同志，請把褲脚撩到膝蓋上，静默三分鐘，仔細想一下，在二條飛毛小腿上，各據一臠的吊襪帶，是不是日本貨？這日本貨吊襪帶之内，是不是藏有一絲絲的橡皮綫？</p>
<p>不錯，這是橡皮綫。這種橡皮綫，假使不織在棉織物裏，那麽，可把它原來的長度，拉長到幾倍。</p>
<p>日本的原來國土，正像一條狹長的橡皮綫。自從侵佔了琉球，台灣，吞噬了高麗，遼東，日本的橡皮綫，就已拉得很長了。歐戰之後，代管德屬南洋羣島，這是把橡皮線又拉長了幾倍。但是自從奪取了東北，雖然又把橡皮線拉長了若干，可是各國已有起而干涉之勢，而日本國内，也漸露不穩之態。這正像橡皮線雖拉得長，因已長得過了橡皮線的能耐力，已呈中斷的現象。</p>
<p>橡皮線雖拉得長，可是拉斷了，縮成二小段，就不能保持原有的長度。所以拉長橡皮線，看着雖似很好玩的把戲，其實是非常危險的一同事。三寸長的橡皮線，就祇可派三寸的用途。假使硬要把三寸橡皮線，派做三尺用，那麽，拉斷了，連三寸用途都不能派，那是何苦？</p>
<p>日本那橡皮線，現在已拉到了將斷的程度，假使還不放手，一旦斷了，一切皆休，就是原來那麽的長度，也不能保，早已分改二段了。</p>
<p>章馬二氏勸日本把橡皮綫縮出高麗，確是對症良藥。但是不到黄河心不死，橡皮綫不斷，日本怎麽肯罷休？</p>

<p>丨［神佑黄袋十萬］丨</p>
<p>清朝的剛毅，因爲憎恨洋鬼子，預備打他們所以練了些兵呌做［虎神營］：取［虎］能吃［羊］［神］能伏［鬼］的意思。而且一念符咒，槍彈便打不進肉裏：施起法術來，［洋鬼子］都被飛沙走石打死。結果，符咒雖是没有用，果眞也伏掉許多［鬼］鬧了一塲亂子。當時高等華人並不因爲失敗了傷心，却怪他們太愚蠢。和［科學的］洋大人交際上不體面，所以稱他們［拳匪之亂］。［拳］是赤手空拳的意思：把那些大刀長槍符咒盾牌等［國寳］［神器］都蔽護去了。［匪］是替政府脱去干係的遁辭。而且進可以［剿匪］，［剿匪］可以媚外。旣是［拳］，又是［匪］自然應該接個［亂］。但是，［一時一景］，中山先生却褒揚他們是民族的革命意識之表現。地獄裏的寃魂，才算有了超升的機會。然而各人對於名辭的精裁，眞使人更信［名不正，則言］不順］的鐵律。譬如看今天的報上，又有一個同上面彷彿的消息，原文如下：　　（二十日北平電）全平和尚捐製神佑　　黄袋十萬。贈前線各軍。</p>
<p>現在倭鬼子已殺到了熱河，全國已同仇敵愾。和尚亦華夏之民，愛國之心，當不甘落後。但各界提倡的［航空救］國］，與［非科學］的敎義不合。乃有所謂［神佑黄袋］之［法寳救國］。［神］與［虎神營］之［神］，同取伏鬼之意。［虎神營］三字，僅有攻而未有守，前車之覆，後車之鑒。故用［佑］。旣伏鬼，又佑已，堪稱知彼知已，當能百戰百勝。</p>
<p>而救國同時又可宣敎；猶在其次。因此回憶去春淞滬抗日戰中，各地女學生均捐輸軍服衣褲諸類，並有親展玉手，挾有［祝君勝利］［大丈夫］等字樣，使軍心大奮。但比之［神佑黄袋］，又瞠乎其後矣！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>倭子，倭子便是倭宼。因爲崇明是一個海島，防守的兵力又　　是特别的薄弱，因此，在明朝快要亡國的幾年裏，倭宼便開始架着小船，仗着鋒利的倭刀，成君結隊的過海來搶刦：官兵旣不能防護百姓，百姓祗有自動起來抵抗的一法了。田莊主便是主張抵抗最烈的一個。在過去的五年裏，他已曾指揮着他的子弟和一村的村民，殺敗過倭子兩次。</p>
<p>［好！老頭子！記着吧！過三年我們再來報仇，非把你全村殺］一個鷄犬不留，也出不了我們這口鳥氣！一當倭宼第二次被殺敗，田莊主率領着大衆，一直追逐他們到海邊的時候，有一個已下了船的倭子，咬牙切齒地用倭刀指着田莊主，這樣發白誓着。</p>
<p>過去的事實，證明這倭子所説的話，並不是滑稽的恐嚇，因爲倭宼是心腸最毒，又是最富獸性的東西，他們把殺人列爲家庭敎育之一，尤其是勇於報仇。田莊主也相信他的話，會有實現的一天，所以在那一次平定之後，他心上是十二分的不寗静：然而他並不畏怯，他更不想棄家逃走，他祗是努力的訓練子弟和村民，每天準備着大厮殺。</p>
<p>因此，小鈴的父親，便把和倭子打仗激勵他的兒子；小鈴聽了，也就格外的努力起來，恨不能馬上就長出幾百斤力氣，好把他的長槍，望倭子的胸膛上搠窟窿去。</p>

<p>金融金潮奔騰澎湃</p>
<p>外銀猛升開船狂瀉十兩</p>
<p>匯市緊補空急反漲四兩</p>
<p>金市近來變幻極速、昨晨外電倫敦大條近　　遠俱畏三一二五、而美銀雖祗升二五、但其交易價格、則猛升一分、遠期銀價猛升九厘餘、銀行私電又長九三七五、故金市物品毛盤曾做至五十六七兩、後因匯市開出未見奇鬆、加之乘低補空者如丙興等俱來購條、故晨開爲七百六十兩、開後卽行上升、匯市亦極緊、銀行胃口尚好、曾盤旋而漲至五兩外、乃見回頭、匯豐持牌先令長一二五、美匯大二五、亦在此後揭曉、六月份曾做至二十九元六二五、金價亦退爲二兩八錢、此後一帆風順、猛力跳上、實因人心極好、匯市結欵亦多、大戶紛紛進條、雖有英國欲收現金之訊、但市塲中並未重視六月份美金麥加利曾吃二十九元半、旋四三七五、亦屬難結、乃跳至七十兩而止、其後回落兩餘、午收爲七百六十九兩七錢、下午初時毛盤曾做至七十二兩、聞廣帮脱手、志豐永恒餘俱售故開盤已退爲六十八兩七錢、匯市亦平、故先到六兩三錢、入後又趨緊張、六月份美金曾做至二十九元三一二五、（銀行進價）及二五、（出價）中央曾托恒興進現三百十五條、（價計二兩半·一百零五）條一三兩·二百十條、（故更漲至七十三兩一錢、）而後匯市轉平、金市亦回最後收盤爲七百七十一兩、查一日間晨開雖猛跌十兩餘、至後仍能拉至原價、結果反能略漲、市况誠極變幻之能事、匯市緊、補空急、人心乃穩、是爲反漲之主因、烚赤計照加十三兩至十四兩、掉期爲四兩半、俱無多量成交、今將一日間市况分誌如後、</p>
<p>晨開因海外銀市銀市猛升之故、理因降低故開盤爲七百六十兩、匯市開出雖較前收硬起、惟亦不多、近期出價英匯一先令八便士五六二五、美金二十九元二五、故開後卽漲、恒餘大德成俱進、而至一兩外、福昌乾昌祥更進至二兩、物品略出、爲一兩三錢、匯市亦緊、四月份美金二十九元四三七五接不得、志豐永恒餘更購至三兩、雖見回落兩餘、但買意仍旺、福順元亨天豐永俱進、而至三兩半、兆豐昌亦購、而至四兩半、匯豐出四月份美金三七五、源茂永脱手、退至三兩四錢、此後更旺、美孚求結六月份美金五六二五而不獲、恒興上傷進條、乃至五兩二錢、物品及宏利前來售條、而至四兩、匯豐掛牌先令畏一二五、美金升二五、至此揭曉本無十分痛養癢、但以匯市六月份美金仍做六二五、天豐永等來出、乃降至三兩内、爲二兩八錢、物品勿來進條、而升至四兩外、麥加利仍吃六月份六二五、此時稍起徘徊、及至盤根扖六月份美金半元、大德成大興永俱來猛進、而達六兩八錢、先因物品套頭售條而低、更因匯市微鬆、六月份美金五六二五難出而更跌、恒餘售至四兩四錢、生大略購而拉上兩許、三月份美金一二五匯豐要、元亨恒餘等奮進、而抵七兩半、乾昌祥來售、趨勢又形盤旋、先爲六兩光景、福餘福昌志豐永更出、而至六兩内、大興永恒餘售條、而爲四兩六錢、蓋匯市微平也、但麥加利續納六月份美金五六二五、乃盤旋而升至五兩半、大興永猛購、達七兩七錢、其間雖曾降至六兩内、但此後卽見見長驅而進、麥加利又扖六月份半元、匯市大佳、宏利進至八兩外、志豐永更進至九兩光景、六月份四三七五尚屬難結、福順義豐永俱進、而至七十兩、此時已迫午收散戶見高價而售、乃退爲八兩九錢、未幾仍見回上、午收遂爲七百六十九兩七錢收市後買風極熾、續又升至七十兩外、故物品拍七百七十兩零五錢、</p>
<p>後開盤前物品毛盤中曾做至七十二兩光景　　、志豐永首來奮售傳聞廣帮脱手、散戶跟風而出、爲七十兩、更因恒餘再來售、乃退至七十兩内、開盤七百六十八兩七錢、麥加利仍來扖　六月份美金四三七五、故曾升至九兩外、兆豐昌售至八兩、宏利亦出、而爲七兩三錢、福餘乾昌祥俱來購條、而又哄至九兩外、志豐永仍來售出、散戶本屬空方、更猛力撳價、其問雖因源茂永進條而回升數錢、卒因華比塞五月份美金三一二五、加之永豐福昌俱出、乃跌至六兩三錢、志豐永趁低價忽進、好到七兩半、福餘亦購、而出八兩外、福昌進至九兩四錢、生大脱手、而爲八兩二錢、此後匯市忽佳、東亞吃四月份美金一二五志豐永恒餘俱進、而出七十兩、六月份美金三七五銀行要、四月份一二五已不易結進、志豐永更進而達一兩、慶發永福餘俱購、正金更納六月美金已三一二五、加至二兩半、蓋孟買亦來電告小落二安那、物品微出、乃見盤下至一兩六錢、而又回升、恒興卽於此後代中央銀行開現、而達七百七十三兩一錢、但福昌兆豐昌趁高脱售、匯市亦平、恒興瑞興雖有買進、但因恒餘福餘售電之故、祗能在二兩内外徘徊而已、麥加利　華比俱來塞出六月份美金二五、是以不能再行上漲、此時市况極爲平衡、入後因華比脱售六月份美金三一二五、乃漸漸退至一兩内至零四錢、恒餘内興忽來進條、乃漲至一兩七錢、但散戶脱售殊多、仍不能支持在一兩外、加之祥豐亦出、而見七十兩、然此關難破、七十兩内限價欲進者頗多、乾昌祥福餘俱來進條、匯豐亦扖六月份美金三、五、仍見拉上、最後卽爲收盤七百七十一兩、物品拍一兩半、查一日間最高價七百十三兩一錢、最低價七百六十兩、有十三兩一錢相差、結果較之前收反能回漲四錢、</p>
<p>揭價因匯豐掛牌美金長二五、計二十八元　　六二五、合標金價八百三十八兩四錢三分、照收盤價言、約撳六十七兩餘、較前收少撳七兩七錢餘、本月份登賬七百七十九兩、三月份七百七十五兩、四月份七百七十兩、上午補水七百七十三兩、下午七百七十四兩、</p>
<p>交易極爲興奮、計恒興元亨福餘福順乾昌　　祥大德成義豐永源茂永大興永志豐永等均進、瑞興永豐天豐永宏利慶發永福昌等均出、大連帮進出俱有、但大致軋進、廣帮恒興共進四百餘條、生大進出不多、猶太人喬直夫聞在毛盤中曾有售出、</p>
<p>烚赤仍見徴降、初開照加十三兩、乃盈豐恒　所售、大德成則稍納、又做至十四兩、同行中仍互相對做、乃永豐售予大豐恒者、交易俱屬零碎、</p>

<p>報告脱離理由及自首經過</p>
<p>母再阻掣政府抗日的路綫</p>
<p>共黨青年團江蘇省委書記、中央執委主席團委員、兼組織部長孫際明、憤外冦壓境、國勢危迫、深自覺悟、毅然自首、今晨十時、市政府情報處特招待各報社記者、介紹與孫氏會晤、首由市府情報處長張廷榮、及公安局特務主任王永華介紹、後即由孫際明起立、報告脱離共黨理由、及自首經過、孫氏係於一九二七年加入共産黨、曾在莫斯科中國大學讀書、一九三○年歸國、曾任青年團江蘇省委書記、中央執委主席團委員、兼組織部部長、茲錄述孫氏脱離共黨宣言如下、</p>
<p>脱離共産黨宣言（一）歷史是在重演着一九二七年大革命的狂濤、被帝國主義的干涉、而遭受到極大的挫折、然而假如認爲一九一七年革命的失敗、唯一的是由於帝國主義的鎭壓、那我們就墜入了宿命論的圈套、就根本放棄求得中國革命澈底勝利的奮鬥、大革命失敗主要的原因、是由於革命領導的錯誤、而對着這一錯誤負責任的、却是中國共産黨破壞統一的民族單綫、分散民族革命力量的策略、目前形勢嚴重、更不下於當時、東三省已淪亡於日本帝國主義的踐踏蹂躪、熱河平津亦在日本軍閥砲火威嚇之下、然而中國四萬萬之衆、雖然呼號啼泣、年復一年、但卒不曾能給日本帝國主義的節節進攻以致命的打擊、這也不是由於中國民族的萎頓或衰敗、没有可能抵抗帝國主義的血統、而是由於中國本身的分裂、由於中國共産黨分裂民族革命力量、破壞民族革命戰綫的策略、由於中國共産黨發動工潮學潮、變本加厲的執行其流寇式的蘇維埃革命、以擾亂後方、陰謀顚覆政府、阻掣政府抗日的路綫所造成、這種情形與一九二七年比較、别無二致、雖然、歷史的推演、對於中國四萬萬羣衆、不無敎益、中國共産黨抄襲俄國革命經騐、以爲俄國革命、乘大戰的機緣、實行［祖國敗化］、［變帝國主義戰爭爲國内戰］爭］的策略、而奪取了俄國政權、企圖在中國依法泡製］殊不知中國爲次殖民地的國家、爭取中國之自由解放、保護祖國、厥爲全中國民衆之要求、世界上民族解放運動的歷史、莫不證明共産黨在民族解放運動上主張的荒謬、俄國革命、雖因此而僥倖成功、然而中國共産黨這種錯誤路綫、則適足使其遭到殘酷的失敗、最近蘇區的縮小、城市工作的猛退、共産黨脱離了農民羣衆、歷史的推演、一幕一幕將共産黨在中國的根據消滅着、</p>
<p>（二）中國民族的哀榮、人民的生死、完全寄托於反日戰爭的成敗、而中國能否集中國力一致對外、又爲這一戰爭勝利的先决條件、請看中國共産黨之所作所爲、無一面非背叛民族的利益、（一）正當國難日亟、滿州華北淪於日本帝國主義砲火之下的時侯、中國共産黨乘政府國民集中力量、抗日禦侮、遂命令全國紅軍總動員、爭取所謂一省或數省首先的勝利、在所謂蘇區、實行横徴暴歛、强抽丁甲、以致蘇區人民、婉轉呻吟、哀震天野、最近又乘熱河事變、以江西福建紅軍爲主力、以川陜鄂豫等紅軍爲呼應、攻取撫州南昌、</p>
<p>軍行動的不滿所以用紅軍總司令名義、頒佈對日宣戰通電的宣言、實則此種掩耳盜鈴之技倆、適足以暴露其背叛民族、破壞反日戰爭的陰謀、中國蘇區紅軍的存在、除了破壞反日戰爭以外、有無革命意義、卽中國共産黨員、亦不能自圓其説、就以馬克斯主義、列寜主義而論、革命之成敗、要以城市爲主、鄉村爲客、然而中國共産黨僞了舖張其流寇政策、乃大放厥詞、以爲中國革命之領導者、乃爲匿居山林古刹之紅軍與蘇維埃、寜非痴人説夢、證諸事實、則舉凡紅軍足跡所至莫不百事不舉、土地荒蕪、人口鋭减、文化毁滅、往者以爲蘇區惡象、爲秋日的旨動路線、立三的半托落斯基路線所造成、而今日共黨領導、乃在在以國際路線相標榜、以列寗主義相彩飾、然則咎又誰屬、所以共黨主義之不適合於中國國情、乃一鐵的邏輯、雖中國共産黨、再碰壁十五年、亦莫能辯、中國蘇區紅軍之存在、除了破壞民族革命分裂反日戰爭而外寧復有其他意義、（二）利用帝國主義進攻所造成中國經濟的低落、工黨生産的恐慌鼓動工人罷工、造成城市的混亂、以遂其破壞生産的陰謀、使工人生活更形痛苦、失業工人、更形增加、中國共産黨製造罷工强迫工人罷工的策略、實際上已走到山窮水盡他地步、一切罷工爭鬥的經騐、都證明工人自發的鬥爭、每每可以得到勝利、而共産黨所領導的爭鬥、却每每遭到失敗、這也不是偶然的、因爲中國共産黨所領導罷工、井非爲保護工人利益而是犧牲工人利益以造成後方的混亂、加深中國經濟的危機、以减弱中國民族抗日的力量、中國共産黨的領導、常以其在罷工爭鬥中國無能、歸咎於下層組織的錯誤、然而事實勝於雄辯、一切大的罷工爭鬥、莫不經過中央常委的討論、甚至常委的直接指揮、然而這些事鬥、却更遭到大的失敗、卽以黨内哄動一時、傳相慶頌紗廠工會、也不過是曇花一現、現在又是完全消失、在中國共産黨的歷史上、脱離工人羣衆的事實、從没有比現在這樣利害、或者中國共産黨的領導、認爲這只是一時的偶然現象、然而凡稍有見識的人們、不難了解、在民族熱忱飛騰鼎沸的中國、要以勞資爭鬥爲其活動的骨幹、卽是僥倖的成功也不可能、（三）中國共産黨特别注意在日本帝國主義進攻區域中的農民運動、自從所謂北方會議、否認了中國革命發展的不平衡性以後、加緊在滿洲山東河北等處農民游擊戰爭的佈置、因爲在那些地方的農民暴動、最足以阻掣國軍的開拔、以與日軍作戰、山東日照的游擊戰爭、河北高陽蠡縣的農民暴動、都是從這平产足點去發動、結果自然只能得到殘酷的失敗、以上幾點、只不過是對於中國共産黨、目前策略路綫在大的方而的解剖、然而共産黨的末運、却不只是表現在其政策方面、</p>
<p>（三）中國共産黨内部派别傾軋、尤屬黑幕重重、最近幾年來、共黨内所謂機會主義路綫者、層見迭出、没有一　比較穩定的時期、立三路線以後、陳紹禹·秦邦憲·等、包攬大權、排除異已、挾私人以自重、陰險武斷、以致人人自危、形成了共黨内四分五裂的狀態、最近共黨人員、紛紛脱離自首、也就是共黨領導路線錯誤的結果、我們相信在最近的將來、由於共黨路線的碰壁與下層人員的覺悟、共黨内部的解體、將更要不可收拾、我們在共黨内幾年來工作的閲歷、使我們最後的覺悟到以往的錯誤、毅然脱離共黨、我們三信在共黨内、尚有無數最優秀的青年、因惑於一時的衝動而誤人歧途、他們將用自已的經騐、了解到自已的錯誤、而翻然悔悟、共同站在三民主義旗幟之下、爲中國民族解放努力、我們雖然與共産黨組織宣、佈脱離、而對於過去在共黨内相識的朋友、仍然願意保持私人情感、如有爲國家民族計而表同情者、或尚猶疑未决者、而加垂詢、請投函上海郵政信箱二一五○號、當爲一一致答、孫際明、一九三三年二月於上海、</p>

<h3 id="c93">叛逆新解 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 天力</p>
<p>自從前歲［九一八］日本佔據我東三省國聯開會以來，一切辭典就都得重編，譬如［侵略］應解作［自衛］，［傀儡，］稱爲［獨立國］之類，古志的舊辭典是决找不出這樣嶄新的解釋的，他如［有組織］與［戰爭］與［和平］一切定義的更定與完成，都要感謝日本人的努力，這，非但字典界爲之一新耳目，實亦爲劃時代的鉅製，偉矣哉，最近而我們又看到［叛逆］兩字的新解。</p>
<p>據報載二十日路透電，日閣議對特委會報告書宣言，送國聯誣我政體庇護［叛逆］。這兩字眞用得新奇可喜，不失爲二十世紀外交界的大發現，我想除了</p>
<p>創造這名詞的日本軍事外交界以外，全世界十四萬萬有餘的人只有贊嘆吧！</p>
<p>日人的東方性表演得眞像，善於翻歷史，求古董，大學敎授竭力鼓吹説滿蒙非中國領土，可惜没有推論到明清以前，更没有説及朝鮮是箕子的张裔，軍部更搜到了廢物溥儀，就借他來做幌子，有了這可憐的猴子，於是戲就有得看了，一般縮着尾巴的狗兒，於是也開始摇擺起來，於是而雜湊成［傀儡國］於是而談所謂［王道仁政］於是而有所謂［討伐叛逆］的活劇，丨丨怪肉麻有趣的，這笑話眞不下於［騎驢覓驢］這裏日人的創造性丨丨不，是翻造丨丨並不遜於模仿。</p>
<p>講到［叛逆］，古話就是［大逆不道］，與今之［反革命］意義相似，或許過之，聽到了這兩字，不期然的全體人凛然肅然的聯想到［族滅］與［凌遲］這幾個字上去，説來誰個不怕，而今却於無意得來，眞是非分之至，日人眞善於詭辯。。幸而日人是用地域來定［順］［逆］的，所以只有在前線抗賊的朱霽青將軍與湯玉麟主席以及一般東北義勇軍等才夠得上這罪名。倘從歷史的見地來説，我們是曾一度做過［大清朝］的奴隸的，現在奴隸居然躍登了寳座，這叛逆的罪名，更不用審定，准得推出午門斬首。這日子我想總會得到，丨丨至少是會得提出，至於頭的究竟斬不斬，全看我們叛逆得澈底不澈底！</p>
<p>現在我要説，我們是叛逆了，叛逆了。［大清］推翻了龍座，叛逆了日本，丨丨没有向帝國臣服投降，但日本又叛逆了誰呢？我要問遍這世界上十二萬萬。五千萬被壓迫的大羣。</p>

<p>在現在國難時期，抵乕仇貨，提倡國貨的聲浪，高唱入雲，但是都是口頭的抵制，至於實力抵制，直是寥若晨星，所以我們不必談抵制，祇須談提倡的方法，記者祇求食用品中的白糖一項而論，每年從國外的進口，若一查海關册，其數當屬可驚，所以我們不能不去注意他，去研究製造的方法，以爲實力的抵制，茲將槭樹製糖法，條舉於後，深望國人加以意焉。</p>
<p>（一）槭樹的形狀槭樹是落葉喬木，葉狀如手掌，至三四月開紅色的小花，果實有二翅，藉風力傳佈種子，和楓樹相類，含有糖分，頗合製糖之用。</p>
<p>（二）取在春末夏初的時候，槭樹漿液最爲充足，可於此時在樹身上割成Ａ字形，接以竹管，約十分鐘後，便有汁從管中流出，下面以器盛之，但取汁時間，以早晨爲最宜，過遲樹汁若受日光蒸曬，必至結皮，難以流下，</p>
<p>（三）濾去雜質取白絹製成袋形，將取得樹汁，傾入袋内，用力徐徐壓榨，流出之汁，即可入釜煑煉。</p>
<p>（四）煑煉將濾過之汁，倒入鐵鍋中，加火蒸煑，隨時用棒攬拌，不可使釜底之汁燒焦，焦則味苦，約二小時後，汁液漸濃，成爲膠漿，則减低火力，加入雞蛋及牛乳（約五十斤濃汁，加雞蛋四個），牛乳五兩，）調匀後，如見雜物氣泡浮起，即用銅絲網濾去之，二十分鐘後，即可熄火，去蓋，這時鍋中樹汁，遇冷便凝結成爲半流動體，</p>
<p>（五）置長約三尺五寸，闊約二尺，高可三尺之搪瓷器一，器底有無數小孔，底上鋪布一層，取鍋中將凝未凝之樹汁，傾入搪瓷器内，此時樹汁中所含之密，即從小孔漏下，用器盛之，所得即爲純潔白糖矣。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>春來了，由春所帶來的消息，在自然界是一幅美畫的顫動，在人問是是萬里烽燄的困戰。</p>
<p>住慣城市的人，本來不大感到節季的轉環，歷史久遠的老大民族，最怕的也就是沉淪不振。</p>
<p>比如這五光十景大厦崔巍的上海，廣袤數十里的土地，全是人工化了，一層石塊一層泥，而又膠着厚厚的柏油，草木無法寄生，地面也便四季成了清一色，春天没有花香駕語，夏天又不見綠林成蔭，秋天也就缺乏紅葉的繽紛，冬天也不見得落寂蕭肅，富有的哥兒小姐，闊人少奶，浸浴在這樣的環境裏自然只知天煖了，换輕紗，天寒了，披毛氅，所以有人説：城裏的人，大抵只令領略氣温的轉換，果然形容的當。</p>
<p>我們的民族歷史確是久遠了，從黄，帝到現在，已有四千餘年，若更上溯到盤古氏，上溯到先史時期，更不知還有多少年代，一脈的在封建漩渦裏翻來覆去，歷代也曾有過不少的異族來統治，老百姓只知那是皇運的遞嬗，不曾感到民族凌夷的哀痛，你説埃及，印度，高麗的民族，現在挨苦麽，大家眞有些不相信，不然也知所以驚惕，自已振作了，呵，歷史的久遠，資格的老大，原是我們民族没有出路的根源。</p>
<p>時候已是初春了，在鄉間已烘動着春的微笑，然在上海還與嚴冬没有兩樣，上海的城市，果然太大了，承受不了</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>春光的普照，</p>
<p>民族已到了危亡的線上，國人還在大夢酣睡，九一八之始，似乎大家還有些憤慨，一二八禍變，國人也曾一度在緊急的氛圍裏，奔走號呼，可是現在呢，熱戰雖在猛烈的爆發了，國人只是一個沉默，除了一些報紙稍稍擂吹外，我們還能見聞到什麽？</p>
<p>尤其是上海自一二八以後，簡直是僵化了，過去蓬勃着的民族精神，難道就在日人的砲火下一次響光了麽？</p>
<p>這可怕的城市之春，這可怕老大民族的沉淪！</p>
<p>要想還眞返本，只有城市的居民，分散些到鄉村去！</p>
<p>要起超拔民族只有大家到前線去！　　春所帶來的消息，一半是好的，一半是惡的，好的是大自然給與的美景，陶醉我們的身主！惡的是暴日的猛攻熱河，掠奪，我們需要從陶醉裏翻起，承受着自然美景的賜與，一齊去槍殺我們的敵人。</p>
<p>春所帶來的消息，我們不要太樂觀，也不要只興嗟嘆，時代到了，民族需要我們努力了。</p>

<h3 id="c99">童養媳 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 馮有章</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個未滿十七歲的孩子，照例還是在求學的黄金時代；不過爲了環境的窘迫，不由你不輟學就尚。我想這三年的學徒生活，眞是我全生命中的關鍵：學得好，一生受用，學得不好，終生就没有出息了。這樣一想，我應該怎樣地努力呀丨可是我的煩悶的婚姻問題，使得我不能抓住這全生命的關鍵，毫不放鬆地去建築我前途的基礎。</p>
<p>當我五歲的時候，憑了媒妁之言，就定了姓榮的小姑娘；她從小就童養在我的家裹。她是一個落鄉種田人的女兒，從没有進過學堂；所以［情感］［風雅］……她是一點不知道的。我對於這層，倒還不發生强烈的反對。最苦惱的，就是她的上肢，太欠靈活，做起事情來，十分障碍。加上她是近視眼，所以她間直需要别人來服侍她。</p>
<p>因此我就生出種種問題來了；現在一一寫在下面；請先生細細的復我：（一）普通人家，娶一個妻子，當然要望伊能夠料理家務，像我的這位未婚妻，是否可以勝任？（二）她初到我家來的時候，本來是很活潑的，後來生了一塲病，才弄到這樣地步；所以我們是不是要負相當責任？（三）她雖則這樣的畸形怪狀，可是我的母親，倒很寵愛她；我倘使提出解約前途能不能很順利的實現？（下略）</p>
<p>馮有章謹上</p>
<p>編者按：童養媳的制度，在中國社會裏、很是普徧。牠有二種弊病；第一，因爲從小訂了婚約的緣故，等到男女雙方長，成人，彼此不能和協，想要解約的時候，就不免發生糾紛。第二，因爲大多數的婆婆，不明事理，視童養媳如奴婢，非但不予以受敎育的機會，大都反加以無理的虐待所以［養媳婦脾氣］竟會成爲一種特殊的成語。但是我們以爲，假使能夠當着義女般的養在身邊，處處愛護她，敎導她，並且盡量地予以敎育機會。等到雙方成年後，徴得本人同意，然後訂婚結婚，那麽倒自有其好處。其一，因爲男女雙方，從小住在一起，彼此當然可以嘹解；如其在成年之後，舉行訂婚的時候，没有反對的表示，一定可以意氣相投。其二，因爲在結婚之前，久已做了家庭中的一份子，所以一切都能適應。其三，因爲女的敎育，由夫家盡力供給，所以兩方程度，可以相當。以上是我們對於［童養媳］制度的一般意見。</p>
<p>現在我們來討論馮君的問題罷。其一，馮君的母親，能異乎一般普通做婆婆的人們，對於她的童養媳，寵愛備至；所以她的没有進過學堂，我敢斷定是爲了環境關係，并不是有什麽歧視。你看她對於疼愛的馮君，尚且不得不敎他輟學就商呢！在這種環境下的馮君，幸虧他心地明白，否則難免欲求［情感］［風雅］，反致討場没趣呢！其二，普通人家，娶一個妻子，當然要望伊能夠料理家務，不過這究竟不是十分費力的事，如其不是一個殘廢，總能勉强勝任。據來信説，馮君的母親，還是非常寵愛她的媳婦，那末她决不是一個殘廢，至多有些畸形罷了。其三，人的疾病，有的當然可以醫治的，但也有絕對無法治愈的。馮君的未婚妻，旣經童養在家，那未她有了病，就得替她醫治。馮君的母親，旣經寵愛她，當然是曾經負起相當責任，替她醫治；那就可以説業已盡責，不負任何責任了。不過我們對於這種可憐人，也應當憐恤他，扶持他，才對。其四，我們因爲對於馮君的夫婚妻，究意怎樣情形，不能十分肯定，所以對他的問題，也就不能斷然回答。我們的答復是，倘使她未到殘廢的地步，不妨爲着憐恤她而穩認一下。要是不幸她眞是一個殘廢者，那末祇能解約；在這種條件下，非但你的母親，不致堅持；就是她的父母，也不能反對。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Forty-Two Votes to One <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>League of Nations Report Passed by General Assembly</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Cast Sole Negative Vote, Siamese Representative Abstained</p>
<p>According to Covenant, No War Within Three Months</p>
<p>Matsuoka Performs Dramatic Gesture</p>
<p>Leaves the Venue in Dismay Before Assembly Concludes</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly today passed the report and recommendations submitted by the Committee of Nineteen by a vote of forty-two to one. The only dissenting vote was cast by the Japanese representative, Matsuoka. However, as the involved party is not counted according to precedent, the chairman declared the resolution unanimously passed.</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly convened this morning at 10:49 AM. Representatives from the four major European powers were present, with France represented by Premier Pang Gu himself, England by Under-Secretary Eden, Germany by Fang Kailer, and Italy by Alox.</p>
<p>At the opening of the meeting, the representatives of China and Japan almost accounted for over half of the attendees, as all members of both delegations were present. Although the United States and Russia are not member states, they also had observers in attendance.</p>
<p>After Chairman, Foreign Minister Hyemmons, read the names of the countries that had accepted the invitation to participate in the negotiation committee, he declared that the report represented the conscientious efforts of the Committee of Nineteen. He stated that the committee members did not wish to make any further speeches and announced that the Committee of Nineteen had exhaustively considered the opinions of Japan and did not wish to make any changes to the report.</p>
<p>At this time, the Japanese chief delegate, Matsuoka, tilted his head and, with a finger to his chin, displayed a subtle and peculiar expression as he listened to Hyemmons' words. The Chinese chief delegate, Yan Huijing, remained solemn and listened quietly throughout.</p>
<p>Finally, Hyemmons stated that Dr. Yan's statement had been drafted and distributed, so it would not be translated into French again. However, the representatives and journalists responded, "No." Hyemmons then ordered the translator to translate it into French. Matsuoka claimed that the Japanese representative did not need to respond to Dr. Yan's arguments, as they had already been addressed in the written submissions.</p>
<p>In his speech, Yan stated that he felt a sense of relief when he stood up to speak, as they were today judging a major member state for violating the covenant. He felt a sense of gratitude because his country's policies had been upheld and made clear to the world. The unprecedented and barbaric aggression his people had suffered in the past seventeen months in the history of human civilization had not been in vain.</p>
<p>When Matsuoka took the floor, after reading his prepared speech, he exclaimed that Japan would oppose any attempt at international co-management of Manchuria and made outrageous statements, claiming that Manchuria belonged to Japan by right because the Japanese had seized it from Russia, and that today's Manchuria was created by the Japanese. Finally, he stated that for the sake of peace in the Far East and peace in the world, he asked everyone not to adopt the report.</p>
<p>Canadian representative Li Taier then spoke, saying that the report was a unanimous judgment of a committee that was determined to maintain world peace, was well-informed, and was impartial after careful consideration. Canada had made every effort to support various efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution and had never been biased in this dispute. The Canadian government firmly believed that the recommendations in the report would find a solid foundation for peace and development in the Far East.</p>
<p>Venezuelan representative Su Meiqin stated that since 1931, there had been conflicts in the Far East and the Far West, as if the League of Nations Covenant did not exist. Venezuela, in participating in the vote on this report, did not wish to indirectly describe any precedent that could allow for the continued violation of the Covenant on both sides of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Before the vote, Hyemmons read Articles 15, Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 of the Covenant, explaining the importance of the vote and asking the audience to pay particular attention to Section 6. He also said that Japan's veto would be seriously considered by the whole world. The recommendations in the report were a contribution to a cooperative resolution of the dispute, but they had been rejected by one of the parties involved. That country had decided to continue implementing its own policies, regardless of the opinions of other member states of the League of Nations. Finally, he asked all countries to continue to work to find a solution that was necessary for human progress.</p>
<p>Then the report, along with the recommendations, was put to a vote. As each country was called upon to state its support or opposition, thirteen countries were absent or did not respond. Only Siam answered, "[Abstain from voting rights.]" When Japan was called, Matsuoka answered "[Do not approve,]" with a clear and firm tone. The Chinese representative, Yan, answered "[Approve,]" but his tone was not as solemn as Matsuoka's. As a result of the vote, Hyemmons declared it unanimously passed.</p>
<p>After the vote, Chairman Hyemmons stated that the legal importance of this case need not be elaborated. He sincerely hoped that both parties involved would not commit any irreparable acts at this time. In short, an international solution must be implemented, and their solution must be fair and just. The League of Nations must continue to implement the work established by the drafters of the Covenant. After the chairman's statement, the General Assembly adjourned at 1:48 PM.</p>
<p>After the adjournment of the General Assembly, Secretary-General Drummond immediately signed letters to the governments of the United States and Russia, asking them to reply as soon as possible as to whether they were willing to participate in the work of the negotiating committee. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>The Gallery Was Packed (Geneva) When the League of Nations General Assembly convened this morning, there was not a single empty seat in the gallery. Filmmakers were also lined up in front of the venue. The activity in the corridors of the venue was unprecedented. Everyone was talking about what dramatic gestures the Japanese representative would make. When Chairman Hyemmons took his seat, the people in the venue whispered. His snow-white head could be seen through the glass window behind his seat. Matsuoka arrived fashionably late. The Japanese chief delegate, Matsuoka, was among the last to arrive, entering the venue at 10:45 AM, followed by a number of personnel. His demeanor was calm, and he seemed to be one of the most composed groups in the venue.</p>
<p>Chairman Announces Opening Remarks At 10:50 AM, Hyemmons rang the bell to open the meeting and first announced a slight revision to the report, stipulating the actual number of people to be nominated for the negotiating committee. He then said, "Since the last meeting, I have received a number of letters from the Chinese and Japanese delegations, including Japan's recent written opinions. All documents have been reviewed and considered by all members, especially the Special Committee of Nineteen. The General Assembly has instructed me to make the following declaration:</p>
<p>"The members of the Special Committee of Nineteen, after carefully considering Japan's written opinions, hereby announce that the report has been unanimously and impartially passed, and there is no reason to change its wording. Therefore, the Special Committee of Nineteen has decided not to say anything further."</p>
<p>Hyemmons then invited the Chinese chief delegate, Dr. Yan Huijing, to express his views.</p>
<p>Representative Yan Speaks First</p>
<p>Expresses Acceptance of the Report Dr. Yan immediately rose and stated,</p>
<p>"China's policies have been upheld by the League of Nations, and he is deeply gratified that the League of Nations has made a judgment with courageous spirit against a member state of extreme importance, not tolerating its actions in</p>
<p>The Most Outrageous in the History of Human Civilization</p>
<p>Acts of Aggression The League of Nations Has Now Transformed into</p>
<p>A More Powerful and Vital Organ,</p>
<p>As for the report of the Special Committee, there are some omissions, which is regrettable. China does not completely agree with all the details of the report, but as one of the parties involved, it is not appropriate to forcefully extend its views here. The Lytton Commission was organized based on Article 11 of the Covenant. Although China later requested the application of Articles 10 and 15, the Commission interpreted its own mission based on the resolution of December 10, 1931. Therefore, the Commission focused not on determining the responsibility for past actions but on finding ways to avoid the recurrence of such actions. Now that the mediation efforts have failed, the Lytton Report must be read with new eyes. Chapter Two of the Special Committee's report is accurate and has historical value." Dr. Yan then spoke of Chapter Three of the report, citing several sections of the original text, praising them, and briefly criticizing them. He then commented on the powers usurped by Japan, saying that Japan used the South Manchuria Railway as another government within the government, destroying China's sovereignty and treaties. China is deeply grateful for the League of Nations' sympathy for China during the transitional period. China is willing to arbitrate and resolve disputes with Japan regarding the interpretation of treaties, but Japan refuses to accept the obligations under Article 12 of the Covenant. The attitudes of the two sides are indeed opposite. He expressed satisfaction with the report's assessment of the September 18th Incident and the accurate conclusions regarding the status of</p>
<p>Manchukuo. Therefore, the League of Nations must consider methods to fulfill its obligations under Article 11 of the Covenant. The report acknowledges that China is not responsible for the events after September 18th. This conclusion is a terrible but fair condemnation of Japanese militarism and those responsible for Japanese policies. Dr. Yan expressed agreement with the statement that the division of powers between the central government of China and the local authorities of the three northeastern provinces should be announced by the central government of China after the method of Japanese troop withdrawal has been negotiated. Dr. Yan also welcomed the cooperation of the United States and Russia and concluded by saying that China is willing to vote in favor of this report without reservation, but if Japan does not accept it, then China's rights under Article 15, Section 6 of the Covenant will not be affected in the slightest. Matsuoka's Outrageous Speech</p>
<p>Slanders Our Country to the Best of Its Ability</p>
<p>Advocates that the Powers Implement Co-Management</p>
<p>Dr. Yan's remarks were peaceful and calm. Matsuoka's subsequent speech, on the other hand, was strong and infuriating. Matsuoka said that the Japanese government had carefully considered this report and decided that it could not accept it. The Lytton Commission had said that China was a problem that endangers world peace. Japan is located next to China and vast Russia and is comparatively small. For twenty years, the situation of its neighbors has often made Japan deeply worried and uneasy. Looking ahead to the dark future, there is really no line of true light that can reassure this heart. The Committee of Nineteen does not understand the situation in the Far East, Japan's position in an unprecedented environment, and the ultimate purpose that prompted Japan's actions. Twenty years of the Chinese Revolution have caused its people to suffer all kinds of disasters. Millions of people have died from war, abuse, banditry, floods, and droughts. The suffering they have endured is not</p>
<p>China has long abandoned its obligations as a sovereign state, and Japan has suffered the most from this. Since the revolution, the country has been shattered, and the so-called territory of the Chinese Empire under the Manchurian dynasty no longer exists in the Republic of China. Now Manchuria has left and established an independent country. Japan wants to cooperate with China to make Manchuria a peaceful and orderly region, but China often obstructs Japan's efforts. Japan is confident that it will always be a pillar of peace, order, and progress in the Far East. Therefore, Japan has adopted a firm stance in Manchuria. The League of Nations initially sought a solution faithfully and impartially, but its actions continued to encourage China to adopt a rebellious attitude. A country like China, with more armed soldiers than any other country, is not really a country. Any country that destroys international peace at every turn is not a country that respects principles. The Lytton Report is merely superficial and does not have an in-depth study of the nature of the people of Manchuria. As for the report of the Committee of Nineteen, it considers China innocent and does not say a word about Japan's many years of hard work to maintain peace, increase security, and seek welfare for the people of Manchuria. Compared with other parts of China, what is the current situation in Manchuria? Japan is indeed a great force for maintaining civilization and consolidating order. The League of Nations should consider the final principle of the Lytton Report (this section refers to the international cooperation in China's construction). Can China be changed merely by sending expert commissioners to assist a declining government? Things are not so simple. I am afraid that no major country or several countries would be willing to undertake such work. He asked the Chinese representative to explain whether the Chinese government would accept international co-management. He asked Dr. Yan to make a statement on this point before voting. The true efforts of the international community are increasing the complications of the situation, as evidenced by Rehe. Japan is not worried about the outcome of this conflict, but it does not want to see unnecessary bloodshed in the future. The League of Nations report now has an impact that will give China the impression that it can continue to resist Japan and be found innocent. He dared to ask whether the United States would allow the Panama Canal to be under international co-management, or whether Britain would rely on international co-management of Egypt. Japan wants to cooperate with China to establish peace in East Asia, said Matsuoka in his final words, "I humbly ask you to deal with us and trust us according to our conditions. If you disregard our request, you will make a big mistake. I ask you not to pass this report." When the Chinese and Japanese representatives spoke, the audience listened quietly. After Matsuoka spoke, there were still three representatives who had signed up to speak at the venue. The audience then discussed whether to listen to their speeches and vote on this report before lunch and finally decided to ask the representatives of Canada, Venezuela, and Lithuania to make short subsequent arguments.</p>
<p>Canadian Representative Teer took the floor, saying that the Canadian government recognized that the efforts of mediation had been exhausted and that the Committee of Nineteen was responsible for drafting a report under Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. The report now submitted to the General Assembly is a unanimous and solemn judgment of a well-informed and impartial committee that is keen to maintain world peace. Since participating in the discussion of the dispute, the Canadian government has made every effort to assist the search for solutions by peaceful means, carefully avoiding words and deeds that could endanger the hope of a peaceful resolution, and not lightly judging the facts and nature of the dispute, believing that adding comments and premature pronouncements would only hinder the common efforts to restore good understanding between China and Japan, which is the key to the Far East peace, and make them unable to succeed. The Canadian government, in accepting this report, wishes to express its congratulations on the work of the Committee of Nineteen. To maintain the integrity of international treaties and impose the final effective sanctions, we must be based on world public opinion. World public opinion has focused on the Committee's efforts to seek the possibility of peaceful solutions. Now we have to admit that the Committee's efforts have been futile. The Canadian government now believes that the recommendations in the report can provide a solid foundation for the peaceful development of the Far East. It sincerely hopes that the two sides of the dispute can eventually accept the system listed in these recommendations and reconcile their conflicting claims to the best of their ability. There is no need to elaborate on the seriousness of the resolution. The member states of the League of Nations must make it today. It is important to know that the world's trust in the possibility of a peaceful solution has now been shaken. If the carefully constructed structure of security is allowed to be destroyed, then the solemn respect for the League of Nations must be transferred to the ninth page.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>The International Situation and the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>The European and American powers that have a deep relationship with the Far East issue and the possibility of direct action are Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition to the huge amount of trade and investment, Great Britain's relationship with China is adjacent to its most important colony, India. The Malay Archipelago is only separated by a stretch of water. Since the foundation of the British Empire is built on colonies, the British cannot but have the feeling that China is right next to their bed. Since the industrial capital of the United States has expanded to a great extent, North and South America gradually feel that they cannot spread their wings. The sale of surplus goods cannot but seek a way out across the ocean. The management of the Philippines has already initiated the collapse of the Monroe Doctrine. The participation in the European War and the subsequent exertion of financial power in Europe have completely turned the so-called Monroe Doctrine into bones. When it is advancing eastward with its financial power, how can it forget the vast Asian continent? Trade with China has jumped to the top position, which is enough to give the United States a major encouragement. It is growing day by day and is booming. Since the United States has it, France, since the Great War, has used its position as a victorious country to scrape the sweat and blood of the German and Austrian people with the Treaty of Versailles to create its superior financial power. On the one hand, it uses its financial power to recover the emerging small countries, and its main purpose is to maintain its position as the leader of Europe. It seems that it cannot have this ambition in the struggle for hegemony in the Pacific at present. However, since the colony of Annam is adjacent to Yunnan and Guangdong, it cannot but win over a country with strong power in the Pacific, so that it can take advantage of others to share the spoils, and when something happens in Europe, it can also use it to protect the rule of Annam. Its attitude towards the Far East is in a situation of being neither close nor far. As for Soviet Russia, the management of colonies is fundamentally intolerable to communism. Its most favorable attitude is to consolidate its foundation and wait for the natural collapse of capitalist countries. However, if the Japanese forces in Manchuria expand too much, the southeastern border will be frightened, and the concentration of Manchurian White Russians is also a hidden worry. Therefore, it cannot but pay close attention to the evolution of the Far East situation. Judging from the world economic situation, it is not enough to start an international struggle to save the current panic of capitalist countries. Capitalist powers are afraid that no one would want to realize the so-called world war. However, social unrest at home may not avoid following the footsteps of Imperial Russia if they participate in the war, so they hesitate and wait and see. In terms of the interests of European and American powers, it is the best strategy to wait for others to fight and reap the benefits of the fisherman. It is also a medium strategy to gather the power of European and American powers to defeat Japan in a short period of time and divide its market. The Far East pre-war is booming, and the export of British and French military equipment has shown a booming trend. It is said that watching from the sidelines is the best policy, how can it be said that it is not appropriate. However, if everyone has the same idea, the main battle will never break out, so they cannot but give up and seek the next best thing. Therefore, the international handling of the Far East incident cannot but combine Britain and France and simultaneously involve the United States and Russia. If the Japanese were to succeed in China, the hegemony of the Pacific would never be hoped for by Britain and the United States. The colonies of Britain and the United States in the Eastern Pacific are afraid that they will gradually become insecure. Therefore, the United States' attitude towards Japan has no hope of reconciliation, and Britain's attitude towards Japan cannot but be regarded as a great enemy. The encroachment of Japanese goods on India and the Malay Archipelago has aroused British fears. The Japanese textile industry's overwhelming of Lancashire is enough to make the British terrified. The ignorant British Conservative Party may still want to divide China's interests with the Japanese with the Great Wall as the boundary. Those who are closer to hearing and seeing will naturally feel that it is like seeking skin from a tiger. It is almost only France that has no direct conflict with the Japanese forces and can be properly treated. In recent years, the most important movement in the international community has been to seek a consistent attitude of Britain, the United States, and France towards Japan. However, because of mutual deception and repeated contradictions, the Far East issue has become a tool for the powers to resolve other disputes. Since the beginning of the month, the relations between Britain, the United States, and France have gradually become closer due to Roosevelt's concession on the war debt issue. In addition, since the National Socialist Party came to power, the German-Italian alliance has become increasingly rampant, which has promoted the combination of Britain and France. Russia and France, which have been hostile for many years, have also signed a non-aggression pact because France has no time to plan far ahead, allowing Soviet Russia to deal with the eastern border with all its strength. Therefore, Japan has suddenly fallen into a state of isolation and helplessness in diplomacy.</p>
<p>However, the so-called unity and isolation are only limited to the diplomatic attitude on paper. If we want to take a further step to take practical actions, we still have to go through another period of hesitation and waiting and see because of mutual deception. Do we want to use this diplomatic advantage of verbal benefits but no real benefits to solve the current national crisis? I am afraid that it is just a pipe dream.</p>

Our troops are guarding key passes and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's elite forces, capturing over a hundred enemies and seizing many military supplies.

A unit of our army has been sent to reinforce Chaoyang and will fight a desperate battle against the enemy. There have only been minor clashes in Kailu. Japanese planes are scouting around Kailu. After Zhang Hai Peng's rebel troops arrived in Tongliao, the situation has become tense. Zhang Ri is very busy with military transport in Tongliao, and reinforcements are still being transferred in.

<p>(Nanjing) All circles in Nanjing were extremely indignant after receiving the Japanese ultimatum demanding that Chinese troops withdraw from Rehe and the news that Japan had already launched an offensive against Rehe. However, for the time being, all parties are maintaining a calm attitude to await military news from North China. All parties believe that the Chinese army in Rehe and North China will be able to resist the Japanese army's offensive to the death. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Responsible authorities here stated that the Japanese propaganda claiming that the Chinese army on the Rehe border had mutinied is completely unfounded. According to reports from all parties, the Chinese army in Rehe is determined to resist Japan, and will resist to the end even if only one man and one horse remain. The Japanese propaganda is merely a hope of the Japanese side. Previously, the Japanese side reported that Tang Yulin had long been appointed as an important military commander of [Manchukuo], [but today Tang is still the main figure in the Rehe anti-Japanese army]. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese propaganda is unfounded. It is thought that before long, the Japanese will realize that the so-called military commander of [Manchukuo], Tang Yulin, will be their most formidable enemy. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dong Futing, brigade commander of the Chaoyang garrison, telegraphed Ping to report that Nishiyi, commander of the 8th Division of the Japanese army in Nanling, personally led two armored trains and the 49th Artillery Regiment to attack our positions in the Bajiazi Baiyaozi area of Beipiao on the morning of the 24th. The enemy's flank in Sanbaoyingzi was defended by the rebel Cheng Guorui's troops. At the same time, eleven planes were dispatched from Suizhong to drop bombs and attack our positions. Over 10,000 rebel troops under Yu Zhishan and 5,000 troops from a part of the Sixth Division gathered in the Qinghemen area of Fuxin County. Japanese planes have been flying reconnaissance missions over Fuxin for days. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cui Xingwu, commander of the 9th Brigade of Kailu, telegraphed Tang this afternoon, reporting that there are about 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops on the Kailu border. Thirty Japanese planes are parked at Wangjia Youfang and bomb Kailu every day. The vanguard of our Dadushan garrison has already made contact with the Japanese army. Zhang Hai Peng, commander-in-chief of the puppet army attacking Rehe, arrived in Dahushan on the evening of the 23rd. It is reported that the rebel Zhang Jinghui is scheduled to arrive in Jinzhou from Shenyang with Muteng on the 25th and will be stationed in Dahushan. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's offensive against Rehe began last night, apparently without waiting for the issuance of the Japanese aide-mémoire. They first used planes to bombard Chaoyang and nearby villages fiercely for three days. According to a report from Tang Yulin, chairman of Rehe, the Japanese army's major offensive is using 40,000 troops from Jinzhou, including 10,000 puppet Manchukuo troops. The outer defenses of the Chinese army, such as Beipiao Nanling, etc., seem to have retreated in order to concentrate their forces and resist the Japanese army's fierce attacks. Chaoyang is now the Japanese army's objective. The Chinese army has established solid defensive lines on one side of Chaoyang and on the mountains around it, occupying a commanding position. When the Japanese army began its offensive, they used infantry, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles, and constantly bombed with planes. According to reliable foreign sources, the Chinese army is currently holding firm to the solid positions in Chaoyang. If they are determined to fight to the death, they can resist the superior attacking army for a long time. If the Japanese army wants to advance, they must pass through an exposed valley and be subjected to fierce bombardment from the Chinese army's artillery and machine guns on the four mountains. According to Tang Yulin's report, the Japanese army in the Kailu area will also launch an offensive, probably using the puppet Manchukuo army as the main force, mixed with some Japanese soldiers. (24th Reuters) (Tokyo) Although the Rehe war may lead to an incident in North China, Japanese military authorities indicated today that they have warned the Japanese troops stationed in Pingjin to strictly defend themselves and avoid escalating the situation. The chief of staff of the army in North China has also ordered the commanders in Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan to adopt a cautious attitude. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>From Tongliao to the border. (24th Reuters) (Beiping) The Japanese army attacking Nanling has turned to attack the front of Chaoyang. The battle situation is unclear today. Last night, 60 armored vehicles, full of Japanese soldiers and weapons, departed from Suizhong, attempting to attack the Lingyuan Lingnan area, containing the front of Chaoyang. The Japanese armored vehicles are still underway today. There should be a major battle in the Lingnan area tonight or tomorrow. Kailu is very cold, at minus 15 degrees. Machine guns are difficult to use. Japanese and puppet troops have advanced from Tongliao. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed a certain important person in Ping, saying that the enemy's attacking troops in Rehe totaled about 40,000, including over 5,000 puppet state troops. On the 24th, over 10,000 more troops were dispatched from Shenyang to participate in the attack on Chaoyang. There was no fierce fighting on the front line starting on the 24th. The enemy army plans to abandon the railway line and has the potential to bypass Lingyuan from the Nanyangshan area south of Chaoyang. Forty trucks have been transported to the front from Yixian, preparing to transport troops to the south. Our army has built positions south of Chaoyang and is determined to ensure safety. There were three fierce battles on the Beipiao front on the 23rd. Our army is still holding firm to the Baiyao position. There is no major change on the front line. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) According to transportation circles, the Japanese warlords, believing that a major war in North China is about to break out, have specially dispatched a large number of Japanese warships to harass our China, attempting to contain our country's military strength. The Sasebo Naval Base has dispatched ships in separate groups. On the morning of the 23rd, three Japanese warships were discovered near Nainai Mountain, 40 li off the coast northeast of Haizhou, scouting the situation of our Linhongkou Qingkou Dapuxu Gou ports. They stopped for about half a day and then sailed south. However, our army has completed comprehensive national defense preparations in that area, and the ports are shallow due to sand accumulation, making it extremely difficult for Japanese warships to enter. It is difficult for Japanese soldiers to land. (24th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables the League of Nations</p>
<p>Requesting Effective Sanctions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese side sent us an absurd memorandum on the 23rd, which was immediately refuted by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that on the night of the 23rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently telegraphed the original text of the absurd Japanese memorandum and our full refutation to the delegation in Geneva to be presented at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 24th, and requested the Assembly to take effective measures to prevent the Japanese army from invading Rehe. It is expected that there will be a strong backlash against Japan's atrocities at the Assembly on the 24th. (24th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe, telegraphed the League of Nations yesterday, questioning the methods of preventing the violent Japanese from invading Rehe, saying that during the drafting of the report by the Committee of Nineteen, the Japanese army attacked our Yuguan. When the Committee of Nineteen passed the report, the violent Japanese again invaded Rehe with all their might. The Japanese have reached the extreme in disregarding the League of Nations. What effective methods will the League of Nations take to punish the Japanese military and maintain the dignity of the covenant? It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has translated this telegram into English and telegraphed it to Geneva. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Flying Over the Great Wall</p>
<p>Not Afraid of the Cold, Not Fearing the Wind, Lively and Strong</p>
<p>(Beiping) George Bernard Shaw flew over the Great Wall in a Ford aircraft this morning. (February 24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) George Bernard Shaw fulfilled his long-cherished wish to fly over the Great Wall today. There was a strong wind today, making flying particularly inconvenient, but Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, along with several friends, still took Zhang Xueliang's privately owned luxurious aircraft, flew over snow-capped mountains, looked down upon the Great Wall, winding like a long snake, and then flew over the scenic spots of Yuanmingyuan and the Ming Tombs. The magnificent scenery was spread out under their feet. Mr. Shaw's face showed an expression of astonishment, but he remained silent throughout, and remained so after getting off the plane. The aircraft was driven through strong winds and felt very turbulent. Even veteran pilots felt tired, but Mr. Shaw did not use the footrest when getting off the plane, jumping down as nimbly as a lively schoolboy. When flying at an altitude of 8,000 feet, the thermometer dropped to 35 degrees below zero, but Mr. Shaw did not seem to feel the cold, which can be said to be very robust.

<p>The Circumstances of Zheng Chui's Sudden Death</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zheng Chui, the son of Zheng Xiaoxu, came to Beiping last time with Pu Wei for activities. Because poison was found in Pu Wei's food, and the Beiping-Tianjin military police were investigating very strictly, he escaped back to Changchun under the protection of the Japanese. Soon after, Zheng Chui died suddenly in Changchun. It is rumored that the reason was that Zheng Chui, as the mayor of Changchun, had offended the Japanese. When the Yuguan Incident occurred, the puppet state, instigated by the Japanese, planned to gather flag people in Beiping to secretly form an undercover team, intending to cause disturbances. Zheng Xiaoxu then recommended Chui to come with Pu Wei, but unexpectedly it came to nothing and he fled back. The Japanese were very dissatisfied, criticizing him for ruining things. Zheng Xiaoxu was mocked unbearably, Zheng became ashamed and angry, and scolded Zheng Chui severely. Chui was filled with shame and indignation, and died of depression. He ruined his reputation and became a sacrifice for treason, which was his own fault. Zheng Chui's son, who is studying in Beiping, has rushed to Changchun to welcome Zheng's remains to be transported back to his ancestral home in Fujian for burial.

<p>Articles are Under Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The organizational law of the National People's Political Council has been approved in principle by the Central Political Committee, and 12 members including Ju Zheng and Chen Shuren have been appointed to review the articles. On the afternoon of the 24th, a meeting was convened by Committee Member Ju at the Central Party Headquarters to review the articles.

Overseas Chinese compatriots occupied an important position in the revolutionary process of our party, and in principle should have the opportunity to participate in politics. This time, the organizational law of the People's Political Council stipulates that overseas Chinese will jointly elect eight representatives, which is very appropriate. The method of selecting overseas representatives will be determined by a separate election law, which is based on occupational groups and regional distribution. (February 24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Provinces to Establish County Administration Construction Experimental Zones</p>
<p>Ministries of Interior, Finance, Implementation, and Education Agree on Four General Principles</p>

<p>Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>New Locomotives to Be Used</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The existing locomotives on the Jinpu Railway are insufficient. A portion was borrowed under the British Boxer Indemnity funds last spring. Eight "Mikado" type locomotives were ordered from the UK by the British Purchasing Committee. They have been shipped to Qingdao. The Machinery Department has ordered 160 technical workers from the Pukou, Jinan, and Tianjin three factories to rush to Qingdao to unload them together. After they are ashore, they will be transferred from the Jiaoji Railway to the Jinpu Railway and driven to Pukou for installation. However, because the newly purchased parts are not yet smooth, they must undergo several test runs before they can be officially used. In addition, 20 "Blue Steel" cars purchased earlier have been transported and are now in use. Eight heavy locomotives were also purchased from the UK last year for freight use, which are expected to arrive around June or July. After the new locomotives are in operation on April 1st, the train speed can be increased. The current direct train between Beiping and Pukou takes 36 hours, but will only take 27 hours in the future. More than 500,000 railway ties along the route have also been replaced, and the Yangtze River ferry has transported and installed them. Direct train service between Shanghai and Beiping will be available in July, and the travel time will be at least 40 hours. In addition, along the Jinpu Railway, there are often poor people who cannot afford tickets and climb onto the roofs and bottoms of the cars at each station when the train is about to depart, which is extremely dangerous. It is now planned to allocate old cars to run "poor people's cars" in sections after the new locomotives are replaced. The railway is also uniting with various sectors in Pukou to organize a relief association to rescue petty thieves and those who come to the association for help. 1. Those who are unable to return home will be sent back to their hometowns by the association. 2. Those who are homeless and of strong build will be sent to the municipal government to work as road construction workers. 3. Those who are disabled and homeless will be sent to relief homes. 4. Those who are willing to learn crafts will be sent to training institutions. (February 24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Solving World Economic Problems</p>
<p>As the Main Focus for the Next Four Years</p>
<p>New York, February 23rd. Friends of US President-elect Roosevelt predicted today that after the Democratic Party government takes office on March 4th, the first things to be implemented will be (1) major changes in overseas representatives, (2) close cooperation between the State Department and the Treasury Department, effectively forming a supreme diplomatic agency, (3) abolishing the long-standing most-favored-nation clause policy. They believe that Roosevelt originally intended to appoint Hull as Treasury Secretary, but in view of the fact that most diplomatic issues in the next four years will be related to the economy, he was appointed as Secretary of State. Hull also wants Dr. Morey of Columbia University to be the Assistant Secretary of State. Furthermore, the appointment of Wording as Treasury Secretary can also be seen as proof that the Treasury Department will cooperate with the State Department to solve diplomatic problems, because Wording was previously rumored to be appointed as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. As for the current diplomatic issues, in addition to the undeclared wars in South America and the Far East, the rest are all economic in nature. It is said that Roosevelt will immediately begin to handle these issues in the most direct and informal way after taking office, and all diplomatic policies will be decided by the President in consultation with the State Department and the Treasury Department. It is expected that the issues to be addressed within two months of Roosevelt's inauguration include (1) striving to negotiate a general reduction of tariffs by various countries (a separate tariff agreement for sugar will be drawn up), (2) recognizing Soviet Russia, (3) resolving war debts, (4) negotiating special measures with various countries to revitalize US foreign trade (these measures will likely replace the commonly used most-favored-nation clause with reciprocal agreements), (5) persuading major countries that have abandoned the gold standard to return to the gold standard, (6) seeking a truce in South America and determining a Far East policy, (7) finally deciding on the issue of joining the International Court of Justice. As for overseas representatives, Mellon's appointment as Ambassador to the United Kingdom is entirely due to political relations and will leave office with the Republican government. His successor is rumored to be Judge Pinghan, the publisher of the Louis Fiel Post. Davis will still serve as the representative to important European meetings, and Davis has already agreed.</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York) Professor Raymond Moley of Columbia University will be one of the most powerful figures in the new government in the future. Although it cannot be determined at present what kind of position he will hold, it is believed that after Roosevelt takes office on the 4th of next month, he will still be one of Roosevelt's plenipotentiary advisors. After Roosevelt's election victory, Moley has been planning for him almost every day until now. When Roosevelt discussed war debts at the White House last November, Moley was his only assistant. Three months ago, almost no one in the United States knew Moley's name, but today Moley is famous throughout the country. During the campaign, he drafted more speeches for Roosevelt than anyone else. He is a versatile writer and a master of words, and he is good at drafting moving texts, so he has been of great help to Roosevelt's position. After the election ended, Roosevelt and Dr. Moley became even closer. Now Roosevelt consults Moley on almost everything, and Moley's proposals are becoming more and more influential. Obviously, in the next few years, we will often come into contact with Moley's actions and words. He is of medium height and weight, his face is dark but very clean, his eyes are bright, and he has an approachable attitude. Although he has received a high level of education, he is not arrogant. He is 46 years old and began teaching political science as an assistant professor at Columbia University in 1923. He is now a professor of public law. He has written many books and commented on government and politics. He also studies criminology. In his autobiography, he refused to reveal his beliefs in religion and politics. Roosevelt intends to invite him to join the new government so that he can exchange ideas with him during his entire term. Moley has agreed to this.</p>
<p>World's Large-Scale</p>
<p>Drug Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>Difficult to Develop in Central Europe and the Near East</p>
<p>Headquarters to Be Established in Shanghai and Tianjin Concessions</p>
<p>Kaifeng, February 23rd, National News Agency. Russell Pasha, the Chief of Police of Cairo, Egypt, is one of the most effective fighters against drugs in the world. He has cracked down on international drug trafficking organizations. It is reported that Pasha will soon submit a report to the League of Nations on the situation of the world's drug trade. Although the contents of the report are not known in detail, it is said that Pasha has described the history of the world's large-scale drug manufacturing plants, saying that they were first established in Switzerland, but after being discovered by the Swiss authorities, they were banned. The plant then moved to Turkey, where three large factories were established. Later, Pasha reported this to Turkish President Kemal, and they were also closed down. Not long ago, the plant had moved to Bulgaria, but as a result of Pasha's continued efforts, its business situation was far less favorable than before. Recently, because it is difficult to develop in Europe, it plans to move to the Far East and establish a headquarters. It is said that it is seriously considering operating in the concessions of Shanghai or Tianjin, because concessions seem safer, and at least in the near future, they are unlikely to be interfered with by the police.</p>

<p>Japan Plans to Strengthen Mechanized Corps</p>
<p>Large-Scale Cavalry Maneuvers to Begin in Mid-October</p>
<p>Aiming to Invade North China and Siberia</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence. Since the Japanese Ministry of the Army announced its military reform plan, it has stepped up its preparations for war against China and the Soviet Union. It believes that the main weapons for invading North China and attacking Siberia are tanks and armored vehicles. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has indeed ordered a general mobilization to increase the production of mechanized weapons, rushing to manufacture them day and night. For example, the Ishikawa Island Shipyard has now completed part of the order, including 350 new tanks and more than 500 armored vehicles. The weapons are transported by military train to the Asahikawa area of Hokkaido to begin cold-weather exercises. The exercises began on January 10th, using the heavy snowstorm on January 26th as a special tactical exercise. Participants included tanks, tractors, armored vehicles, military trucks, ordinary cars, and motor vehicles from the Setagaya Motor Vehicle School. From the 28th, the entire First Division, the Setagaya Motor Vehicle School, the Matsudo Engineering School, the Narashino Cavalry School, the Chiba Infantry School, and the Tokorozawa and Shimoshi Flying Schools were mobilized in the Tokyo area for a large-scale scientific mechanized corps exercise in the Omiya and Chiba areas. Also on January 28th, a street battle exercise with tanks was held in Yokosuka. In addition, in order to facilitate the invasion of Siberia and North China, the cavalry force is actively strengthened. It is planned to mobilize the 1st, 15th, 16th, 8th, 22nd, 24th, and 2nd cavalry regiments to hold a special cavalry exercise in mid-October this autumn. (Chinese Allied Press)</p>
<p>Great Alliance of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou</p>
<p>Cooperation Regulations Formulated by Liu Xiang</p>
<p>Joint Office of the Three Provinces to Be Established</p>
<p>Chongqing Airmail. The Sichuan War has ended early, and is gradually restoring to its pre-war state. The war in Guizhou Province has also come to an end due to the support of the Guangxi faction for Wang Jialie. Only the remnants of Che Mingyi's troops on the western route have not been completely eliminated. The Yunnan Province has been relatively calm since Long Yun took office. However, Long recently felt isolated and unable to cope with the environment, so he advocated a great alliance of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces in order to maintain the current situation and prevent changes. It is said that Wang Jialie expressed great agreement with Long's proposal, and Liu Xiang also agreed to Sichuan's participation. Therefore, Long Yun sent representative Lu Shouchi, Wang Jialie sent representative Xu Daowei, and Liu Xiang sent representative Lin Bixian to exchange views and reach a consensus, and jointly formulated the Temporary Regulations on Cooperation between Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces for compliance. The contents are as follows: (Article 1) These regulations are jointly formulated by Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, and are named the Joint Regulations of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces. (Article 2) The purpose of these regulations is to promote cooperation and joint liaison between Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, stabilize the local area, promote military and civilian administration, consolidate the border, and relieve the central government's worries about the west. (Article 3) These regulations are jointly initiated and formulated by Liu Xiang of Sichuan, Long Yun of Yunnan, and Wang Jialie of Guizhou. After implementation, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces shall abide by them consistently and shall not violate them. (Article 4) Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces shall take consistent action on all foreign matters. The representatives stationed in various places shall have consistent opinions and shall not be divided. (Article 5) Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces shall jointly unite and jointly run all production matters within the three provinces. (Article 6) Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces shall unite and jointly suppress bandits within the territory, regardless of jurisdiction. (Article 7) These regulations shall be briefly applicable before the official establishment of the joint office of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. (Article 8) These regulations shall take effect after being signed, sealed, and promulgated by the authorities of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. (Article 9) These regulations shall become invalid after the official cooperation regulations of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces are produced.</p>
<p>The above temporary regulations have been recognized and implemented by Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Liu Xiang, Wang Jialie, and Long Yun are currently preparing to establish a joint office of the three provinces, and are preparing to hold a joint conference of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in March.

<p>He Chengjun</p>
<p>Goes to Shaanxi Again to Supervise the Army</p>
<p>Liu Maoen's Troops Have Arrived in Sichuan</p>
<p>Joining Sichuan Troops to Suppress Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. After the remnant bandits of Xu Kuang entered Sichuan from Shaanxi and captured Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Guangyuan, and Zhaohua counties, they wantonly slaughtered. Although the Sichuan suppression troops are loudly chanting for full mobilization, Liu Xiang's 21st Army is far away and needs time to set out, and Liu Wenhui's 24th Army is rumored to be attacking Tian Conglu, so it is not easy to move. In reality, only the troops of Tian Songyao and Liu Cunhou are fighting the bandits. Liu's troops are divided into three routes: the commander of the central column is Zhang Zhongxi, the commander of the left column is Yu Guangwu, and the commander of the right column is Wang. There is also a guerrilla team, led by Leng Bingyun. On the 18th, the bandits divided into three routes and attacked from Bazhong, building pontoon bridges in Hupozhi, Sitan River, Jin'e Village, and Xintanzi to attack Liu's troops. The bandits were repelled, and both sides suffered heavy losses. Tian's troops also divided into routes to attack the bandits. On the 23rd, Tian sent a telegram to Hankou, saying that his troops were only five li away from Bazhong and could be captured. Tian's troops originally had five divisions, and together with the recently formed Yu Anmin Division, there were a total of six divisions. Because it was rumored that Liu Wenhui was planning to seize Tongchuan, two elite divisions were left to defend. However, according to Yang Jintang, the representative of Tian's army stationed in Hankou, all six divisions of Tian's army have gone to northern Sichuan, and only one brigade is stationed in Chengdu. There is no planning or suspicion between Liu and Tian, as it is not the time for that. The actual strength of the troops exceeds the number of bandits several times, but the command is not unified, and they are fighting independently, so it is difficult to completely eliminate the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Chiang repeatedly telegraphed He Chengjun to reside in Shaanxi to command, and He has ordered his staff Bao Chao-ran to lead his entourage to take the Pinghan Railway express train on the morning of the 22nd. He, along with his aide-de-camp Cao Zhenwu, chief of the document section Liu Yaping, chief of the public relations section Peng Shu-you, counselor Wen Jun-tian, and quartermaster Zhu Xiangwen, took the Pinghan Railway special express train north on the morning of the 23rd. He said that "I was instructed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to go to Shaanxi to supervise the army. I am determined to eliminate the evil and pacify the local area. The return date cannot be predicted, but it will not be very long." After He's departure, the affairs of the Pacification Headquarters were originally entrusted to Chief of Staff Yang Kuiyi, Chief Counselor Zhu Chuanjing, and Chief of the Office Chen Guangzu to handle jointly. Temporarily, Zhu received orders from He to go to Beiping on the same train to pay a visit to Zhang Xueliang. Chen will stay for a while and then go to Shaanxi to assist</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau</p>
<p>Hosted Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>The Director Reported That the Expansion Budget Requires 480,000 Yuan. Our Country Is Not Without Manufacturing Talent, Only Lacking Funds.</p>
<p>The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, after the merger of the Fuzhou Shipping Bureau and Shanghai, was ordered to relocate in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic. Since then, it has strived to expand and actively develop, and has added a sales department to formulate various plans. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, it invited newspaper reporters to visit the manufacturing bureau. The bureau provided a small steamboat to pick up and drop off at the Customs Wharf. More than forty reporters from various newspapers arrived at the naval dock and visited the facilities until 5 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting the Progress After the newspaper reporters landed, they were received by the Director Zeng Yijing and the engineers of the entire factory. Director Zeng reported that the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau was founded in the spring of the 7th year of the Republic, originally located in Fuzhou, and manufactured various types of aircraft, including trainers and military aircraft, all of which were used by the Naval Aviation Department and praised by the aviation community at home and abroad as the only domestic aircraft manufacturing factory in China. In the spring of the 20th year, the Navy Department regarded Shanghai as an important commercial port in China, and the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau had a large base and convenient land and water transportation, and the workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard could assist, so it ordered the Fuzhou Aircraft Manufacturing Factory to move to Shanghai and merge, so as to facilitate expansion and active development. In recent years, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have advocated aviation to save the country and strive to increase strength, but the purchase of various types of aircraft is mostly from abroad, which inevitably leads to the outflow of rights and interests. The bureau has now set up a sales department to design drawings and manufacture various types of aircraft for all sectors of society, and has formulated an expansion plan. Our country is not without manufacturing talent, but we feel that we are hampered by (1) the problem of raw materials, such as steel and hardware, which are lacking in domestic production, and (2) the problem of funding, which is entirely dependent on the Navy Department's insufficient funding for development, which has prevented the immediate implementation of the plan. Now, we hope that all sectors of society will assist in advocating domestic aircraft manufacturing, so that even if it is still in its infancy, it will soon be comparable to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Expansion Plan Formulated by Director Zeng Yijing</p>
<p>The plan to expand the manufacturing of aircraft is as follows: to expand the factory so that it can produce 24 aircraft per year, including trainers, fighters, reconnaissance aircraft, bombers, etc. The budget (3) regarding the purchase of machinery, tools, and the most needed raw materials: (1) 150,000 yuan for wood; (2) 200,000 yuan for steel; (3) 50,000 yuan for various equipment, totaling 400,000 yuan. (B) Regarding the manufacturing workshop: (1) The area of the factory building is 11,600 square feet, costing 50,000 yuan to build; (2) The assembly plant is about six aircraft positions, with an area of 4,200 square feet, costing 25,000 yuan to build; (3) The material warehouse has an area of 1,500 square feet and costs 6,000 yuan to build, totaling 81,000 yuan. The total is 481,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cost of each aircraft: The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau's estimated prices for manufacturing various types of aircraft are as follows: (1) 125-horsepower trainer, 24,000 yuan; (2) 210-horsepower advanced trainer, 28,000 yuan; (3) 500-horsepower fighter, 110,000 yuan; (4) 550-600 horsepower bomber, 130,000 yuan; (5) 500-horsepower reconnaissance aircraft, 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Leading the Tour Then, Director Zeng Yijing and engineer Ma Shude led the tour, explaining in detail the various aircraft samples on display and the various types of seaplanes and land planes parked at the aviation department, including the Jiang'ou bomber, the Jiangpeng trainer, the Jiangjing, the Jiangyang, the Jiangyan reconnaissance aircraft, the Jiangyi, the Jiangfeng, the Jianghong trainer and reconnaissance aircraft, the Jianghe, and other nine aircraft, as well as various manufacturing workshops, such as the woodworking factory and the assembly factory. Refreshments were served around 4 PM, and the tour concluded at 5 PM. The reporters then took a group photo with Director Zeng and dispersed.</p>
<p>The Remaining 60,000 Troops of Wang Delin's Army</p>
<p>Are Still Fighting Fiercely in Eastern Jilin</p>
<p>Song Yunzhang Came to Shanghai Seeking Aid</p>
<p>Wu Yicheng Telegraphed the Battle Situation</p>
<p>Wang Delin, commander-in-chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, was forced to retreat from his defensive position in Suifenhe on the eighth of last month due to enemy pressure and lack of ammunition and supplies. They divided their forces and used collaborators as their wings, launching a four-pronged attack on our army's bases in Dongning and Suifen Town on January 1st. Yicheng supervised the front line and fought fiercely with the enemy for four days and nights. They pressed forward in succession, with heavy casualties on both sides. Two enemy planes were shot down by us, and more than half of the enemy cavalry was wiped out by our army. At a moment of life and death, the rear of Dongning reported repeated emergencies, and we had to divide our forces to provide reinforcements. Unexpectedly, Dongning fell to the enemy on January 8th after three days and nights of resistance. On the afternoon of the 9th, our solid positions in Suifen Town and Tianqiao Town were breached by the enemy, and the flanks were threatened. Countless officers and soldiers were killed in action, and after running out of ammunition and supplies, they had no choice but to retreat in different directions. They were then blocked by enemy troops. Our Commander-in-Chief Wang, Deputy Commander Kong, and the various brigades and regiments of our army were cut off from contact. Yicheng rushed to Ning'an through a side road, reorganized more than 30,000 troops, and ordered the eastern route to concentrate on the north bank of the Mudan River, and the western route to concentrate on Dunhua and Emu County. More than 10,000 people remained stationed in the Anhua area and came to ask for orders. Yicheng was planning to advance and cooperate with the friendly forces in southwestern Liaoning and southern Manchuria when he received Commander-in-Chief Wang's order to go to the inland and various mass organizations to report on the army's operations over the past year and to discuss relief plans. All responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Army were delegated to the commander-in-chief of the front line. The various brigades and regiments of Suining Wangyan were to be controlled and dispatched. Therefore, Yicheng not only had the task of advancing westward, but also the planning of the eastern front. How could a man of mediocre talent shoulder such a huge responsibility? However, since the September 18th Incident, there have been no less than 250,000 anti-Japanese self-defense troops in the three northeastern provinces, but they have been destroyed by the enemy one after another. Now, the only relatively complete and powerful forces are the volunteers in southern Manchuria.</p>

<p>The Northeast Association Issued a Declaration</p>
<p>Stating the Purpose of Establishment and the Responsibilities Undertaken</p>
<p>Hoping for Unity From Top to Bottom and National Mobilization</p>
<p>The Northeast Association issued a declaration yesterday, stating the purpose of its establishment and the responsibilities it undertakes. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Northeast has been occupied for two years, and the bloodshed in Shanghai has lasted for more than a year. The result of our country's long-term struggle is only that the enemy's flames have become more intense and the national crisis has deepened. In recent months, the enemy has reoccupied Yu Pass, coveted eastern Hebei, attacked Rehe, and plotted for North China. An unprecedented war has already broken out. If we do not concentrate our national strength and resist to the death, not only will the Northeast have no hope of recovery, but North China will also suffer miserably. Once North China is lost, the future of the country will be unpredictable. This is why the whole country is unanimously advocating active resistance as the only way to save ourselves. However, in order to implement resistance and not stop until the goal of victory is achieved, there are three major prerequisites: (1) The whole country must be permanently united. The reason why the national crisis is so serious and the enemy slanders us as an unorganized country is that this righteousness has not been fully demonstrated. This is also what the people of the country have been consistently demanding in recent years. Fortunately, the whole country has recently awakened and is becoming increasingly unified. We hope that from now on, disputes will be eliminated forever and unity will be maintained from beginning to end. (2) The hearts of the people of the whole country must be permanently unwavering. Since the Opium War, our country has experienced national disasters such as the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion. We should all learn from the pain and work hard to overcome difficulties. However, the habit of being cowardly and seeking temporary ease has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and cannot be reinvigorated, which has led foreigners to ridicule us as having "five minutes of hot blood." The previous events of boycotting goods are proof that their words are not without reason. If we do not wash away the long-standing habit of seeking temporary ease and persevere to the end in future struggles, the country will be destroyed in no time, let alone resist. (3) All parts of the country must be mobilized in unison. The scope of the current resistance war is expanding, and it is difficult to predict how long it will last. However, it can be asserted that it cannot be resolved in the short term. Therefore, the armies in all parts of our country must be mobilized in unison, and the people in all parts of the country must also be prepared in unison in order to implement long-term resistance and achieve final victory. All three of these depend on the mutual promotion of the compatriots of the whole country, and then we can expect them to succeed. We, the members of this association, are willing to work with the compatriots of the whole country to fulfill this unique duty. This is the first reason why this association was established. Even if the resistance struggle can be implemented, there are three things that our compatriots should pay special attention to in order to seek final victory, which is absolutely in our hands: (1) All the people of the country must contribute money if they have money, and strength if they have strength, to support the government. And the financial resources must be concentrated and used properly in order to achieve the greatest effect. Since the national crisis, the spirit of the people in the mainland and overseas Chinese to donate money to resist Japan is not lacking in courage, and the organizations that work hard to support them in various places and groups are also not lacking in number. However, they are either limited to a certain time or a certain event, and gradually decline after the time has passed, or they are limited to a certain place or a certain corner, and the people's strength needs to be further promoted. Now that the national crisis is becoming more urgent and the war is deepening, it is necessary to have a permanent and unified national system of the people to unite the national strength and create long-term anti-Japanese resources. (2) It is necessary to continue to support the armed comrades who have been resisting Japan in the Northeast from beginning to end. The volunteer army in the Northeast has been fighting hard for many years, and the strength lies in the joint efforts of the army and the people. Although the withdrawal of generals such as Ma Su, Feng, and Li from the Northeast has caused the anti-Japanese forces to suffer setbacks, the anti-Japanese spirit of the hundreds of thousands of armed people scattered in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang is still extremely enthusiastic, and the latent power is growing. However, what they need is the active replenishment of ammunition, and what they are looking forward to is the government's dispatch of troops to suppress the rebellion. Now that they hear that the war has started on the border of Rehe, they will surely rejoice and be willing to take up arms to lash out at the tyranny and use their armor and sharp weapons to contain the enemy troops, which is most conducive to the military opportunity. Therefore, continuous support is of utmost importance. (3) It is necessary to gradually strengthen and popularize moral assistance internationally. According to recent news from Geneva, the League of Nations has made a judgment and determined what is right and wrong. Our country has received great international moral assistance. However, the international situation is changing rapidly, and the effort to survive depends on ourselves. As long as we can fight to the death and give the tyrannical Japan a major blow, which friendly country in the world will not help us? Otherwise, if we do not make up our minds and rely on others every day, friendly countries will also have the pain of being unable to help. In the future, we will only use the strength of the whole country to deal with the tyrannical Japan, and use self-help to seek the country, so that we can gradually strengthen and popularize moral assistance internationally. All three of these depend on the efforts of the people of the whole country, and then we can expect them to be realized. We, the members of this association, are even more willing to bear this greatest responsibility with the compatriots of the whole country. This is the second reason why this association was established. The national crisis has been going on for seventeen months now. The sacrifice of the lives and property of our people is almost incalculable, and the sacrifice to recover the lost territory in the future may be a thousand or a hundred times greater than this. With such a great sacrifice, how can we be willing to recognize that the Northeast has become a land of de facto international co-management? Moreover, the corner of the Northeast is not only related to the prosperity and decline of our entire country, but also has a major impact on the changes in the overall situation in East Asia and the world. If it is not fundamentally and reasonably resolved, the seeds of disaster are lurking, and it is bound to become the fuse of an international war and endanger world peace. Therefore, in addition to actively recovering the lost territory and defending the territory, we should also thoroughly study the future development of the Northeast and its relationship with the world. All of our people should take this as their own responsibility. This is the third reason why this association was established. In short, the national crisis will not end until the Japanese pirates are eliminated, and for the sake of national survival and national freedom, any sacrifice is worth it. Now that the hot war has broken out, in order to implement the struggle of active resistance and achieve final victory, we must unite from top to bottom, be permanently unwavering, mobilize all parts of the country in unison, and contribute money if we have money, and strength if we have strength, and seek the country through self-help. In the future, the solution to the Northeast problem and its future development will be a heavy responsibility and a long way to go for the people of the country. The situation is urgent and compelling, and there is no time to hesitate. Only our people can rise up and plan for it. Members of the Northeast Association: Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Zhengting, Wang Xianzhang, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Du Chongyuan, Chu Fucheng, Yang Hu, Wu Xingya, Qi Shiying, Zang Qifang, Chen Lifu, Ye Xiufeng, Wang Yansong, Wu Tiecheng, Li Denghui, Zhu Qinglan, Xiong Xiling, Wang Zhuoran, Mi Chunlin, Wang Shuhan, Li Xien, Xiao Zhenying.</p>
<p>Temporarily Retreat to Russian Territory, Then Secretly Dispatch Trusted Personnel to</p>
<p>Send Orders, Entrusting Vice Commander Wu Yicheng and Vice Commander Wang Yuzhen to Lead More Than 60,000 Remaining Troops to Continue the War. Mr. Song Yunzhang, the Quartermaster General of the Army, was recently dispatched from Shanghai to contact Liang Detang and others, the representatives stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Liang Detang and Zhang Chuyu, the representatives of Wang Delin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, stationed in Shanghai, received a telegram from Wu Yicheng, the Deputy Commander of the Army, who is acting as the Commander-in-Chief. The original text is as follows: To all newspapers, organizations, and anti-Japanese people: Recently, the interior is preparing for armed resistance against Japan, and the battle of Shanhaiguan has dealt a great blow to Japan. At the same time, it is rumored in the Northeast that China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations, and the international situation is gradually changing. As a result, the Japanese imperial warlords who occupy Manchuria are in a panic, and they have concentrated two divisions to attack the National Salvation Army distributed in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. At this time of crisis, Yicheng can only reluctantly shoulder the arduous task, and on February 1st, he assumed the post of Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Army. On the one hand, he fought against the enemy, and on the other hand, he reorganized the army, using the blood-bought experience of the past year to plan the strategy of combat. I am willing to sacrifice everything to fight for the territory of the three provinces. However, I cannot help but say that since the rise of our army in Yanhui, the officers and soldiers have been mostly bankrupt farmers, or unemployed workers, or anti-Japanese rebellious soldiers, or oppressed and conscious intellectuals, who are armed by the people of the three provinces to resist Japan and save the country. They are determined and have been fighting for years, besieging Jilin, disturbing the Jidun Line, destroying the construction of the Yanhu Line, and fighting desperately with the Japanese army on the banks of the Mudan River and along the Chinese Eastern Railway, more than 70 times in large and small battles. Our army has suffered a lot of losses, but after a year of bloody battles, we have dealt a lot of blows to the Japanese warlords. Shao Lizi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Stating That a Method Must Be Determined to Relieve the Northwest</p>
<p>Will Return Home to Bury His Mother and Take a Rest</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning at about 8 o'clock with his wife, Ms. Chuan Xuewen. He went to the hotel to rest, and in the afternoon, he went out by car to visit relatives and friends. In the evening, at 7 o'clock, he went to the Hua'an Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to attend the meeting of the Fudan University Board of Directors, and returned to the hotel at about 10 o'clock. The Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit last night and inquired about the development of the Northwest and other issues. Shao replied in detail as follows:</p>
<p>The Development of the Northwest According to Shao, regarding the development of the Northwest, he has contributed three opinions to the central government during his trip to Beijing from Gansu. The first is to complete the Longhai Railway and reach Lanzhou directly. If we want to develop the Northwest, we must first improve the transportation in the Northwest. The more convenient the transportation, the faster the development of the Northwest. Therefore, we must follow Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's teachings, rush to build railways in the Northwest, and especially implement the central government's repeated resolutions to quickly complete the extension of the Longhai Road to Lanzhou. The second is to establish a Northwest Work Relief Committee to carry out road construction and water conservancy projects. The Northwest has suffered from natural disasters and banditry for years, and the local area has long been devastated. At present, if we want to develop the Northwest, we must first save the people of the Northwest. I hope that the central government will use the spirit of relieving the Yangtze River flood disaster in previous years to relieve the Northwest and establish a Northwest Work Relief Committee, and first improve the transportation in the two provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. The third is to use the latest modern scientific methods and economic strength to conquer nature. I hope that comrades who go to the Northwest should do more practical work and create benefits for the people of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Contribution to the Shanghai Business Community Central's Opinion</p>
<p>Now, I have one more word to contribute to the financial and business communities in Shanghai. I have been to Gansu for nine months, and the impression the Northwest has given me is very deep, that is, the Northwest is indeed a bitter place, but the wealth of the Northwest is hidden underground. Anyone who wants to develop it must first have this understanding: the wealth of the Northwest is hidden underground, and the people of the Northwest are suffering because they have no power to develop it. I hope that the financial and business communities in Shanghai will actively go to develop it, but those who want to develop the Northwest must have the courage and adventurous spirit of the Northeast Volunteer Army, and learn from the Americans who developed western America and the Russians who developed Siberia, so that they can achieve success. At present, the reason why people in Shanghai dare not rashly go to develop the Northwest is that they are worried about the safety of investment. Although I dare not say that the politics of the Northwest is on the right track, commerce and politics have a causal and cyclical relationship. If commerce is not developed, politics will not be able to improve, and vice versa, the more developed commerce is, the faster the improvement of politics will be. Comparing the history of various cities in our country, we can believe my words. If people in Shanghai can go to develop the Northwest, then the politics of the Northwest can gradually improve, and the safety problem is not worth considering. The more powerful the investment of people in Shanghai to the Northwest, the more guaranteed the safety problem will be. This is what I can guarantee for the financial and business communities in Shanghai. Even in the current situation, if people in Shanghai go to develop the Northwest, there is no danger. If I have the opportunity, I plan to talk with the leaders of the financial and business communities in Shanghai, so that they can know the real situation of the Northwest and feel at ease to invest. The intention to resign can be expected to be dispelled. I have been running around for years</p>
<p>In all directions, my mother has passed away for seven or eight years, and has not yet been buried. Moreover, my health has not been good recently, and the doctor has advised me to rest and travel more. Therefore, I plan to stay in Shanghai for three or four days, and then return to my hometown of Shaoxing to bury my mother and take a rest. Then, the reporter asked Shao if his intention to resign from the chairmanship of Gansu Province had been dispelled. Shao told the reporter that although the central government has been trying to persuade him to stay, he still hopes that the central government will appoint someone more capable to preside over the government of Gansu. He has no power to develop Gansu Province, and it is more beneficial to the people of Gansu to report the situation in the Northwest and the ways to develop it to the central government than to preside over the government of Gansu. From the reporter's observation of Shao's intention, if the central government can have concrete measures to relieve Gansu Province, Shao's intention to resign can be expected to be dispelled.</p>
<p>The Preservation of Half of the National Territory of Eastern Jilin, Containing the Japanese寇's Attack on Yuguan Rehe, So That the Japanese Army Can Not Rest Easy in the Northeast, Manchuria Puppet State Always Has the Danger of Collapsing. However, Our Army's Hard Struggle Has Not Received Any Help From Any Party, Even A Bullet. Representatives Have Been Sent To Pass In To Ask For Help, And Only Received A Receipt Of 50,000Ha Yuan. In The Severe Cold Of Winter, Fighting Against The Enemy, Still Wearing Single Clothes, Supplies Are Often Lacking, And Salaries Have No Location, Because The Hardship Is Difficult To Describe. Yicheng Knows That The Source Of Material Only Comes From Victory And Conquest, Taking It From The Enemy. However, The Japanese Warlords Use Various Historical And Social Conditions, All Resources Are Controlled, The Rich Families Move To Cities, The Residents In The Country Are All Poor And Have Nowhere To Go, There Is No Extra Strength To Help Military Supply, And The Supplement Of Equipment Is Also Deeply Worried. If We Continue To Allow The Corrupted, When Facing The Sharp Weapons Of The Enemy, The Sacrifice Will Be Great, The War Will Certainly Be Prolonged, Which Is Not A Good Plan. Yicheng, On Behalf Of The Entire Army, Cordially Asks Our Government Authorities And Anti-Japanese People Of The Whole Country To Provide Assistance, Not Only For Military Plans, To Indicate The Direction, But Also To Provide Material Assistance Continuously. The Survival Of The Three Eastern Provinces Is Related To The Survival Of The Whole Country, The Survival Of The National Salvation Army Is Related To The Gains And Losses Of The Three Eastern Provinces. Please Understand. Wu Yicheng, The Acting Commander-In-Chief Of The Chinese National Salvation Army, Led By Staff Officer Zhou Baozhong, Chief Of Staff Hu Sigang, Commander Of The First Route Yao Zhenshan, Commander Of The Second Route Liu Zhenbang, Commander Of The Third Route Zhang Peng, Commander Of The Fourth Route Zhang Xiangyun, Commander Of The Fifth Route Zheng Xing, Commander Of The Guerrilla Army Li Yanlu, And All Officers And Soldiers Of The Army Bow Down.

<p>New Building On Museum Road</p>
<p>According to the Chinese-language "North China Daily News," the new building of the Asian Cultural Association on Museum Road held its official opening ceremony yesterday evening (23rd) at 5 PM. First, President Bo Fangji welcomed the guests, and then Chief Engineer Pei'er presided over the ceremony and announced the opening. Then, Dr. Cai Yuanpei and Dr. Wu Liande gave speeches one after another. Finally, Mao Gen, on behalf of the association, thanked the donors, and said that the Chief Engineer Bureau and Wu Liande were the two pillars of the association. Among the 150,000 taels of construction funds for the new association building, the Chief Engineer Bureau allocated 50,000 taels, and Wu Liande donated 20,000 taels alone. As for the remaining donations, a total of 40,000 taels were raised, and there is still a shortfall of 40,000 taels. It is reported that the association is the North China Branch of the British Asian Cultural Association, and its main purpose is to study Asian culture. It was first established in 1857 and was called the Shanghai Literary and Scientific Association. In 1858, it was merged into the Asian Cultural Association. Ten years later, the British government allocated the existing site, and the association building was built three years later. After more than 60 years, it was dilapidated, so it raised funds for several years, and the construction was restarted in July two years ago. The construction was delayed due to the Shanghai War, and it was not completed until the beginning of this year. The new building has six floors and integrates Chinese and Western architectural techniques. The first floor is the auditorium, which is named after Wu Liande to commemorate him. The second floor is the library, the third and fourth floors are the museum, and the fifth floor is for the display of works of art.</p>

<h3 id="e7">First Export of Soviet Steamer <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Huge Shipment of Tea Bricks to Vladivostok</p>
<p>Measures for Chinese Citizens Going to Russia</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Timber Arrive</p>
<p>Since the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, the Soviet merchant fleet has resumed the Shanghai-Vladivostok route. Initially, chartered ships were used. Now, the fleet has officially dispatched ships to Shanghai. It has been several years since Soviet merchant ships came to China. The arrival of the "Losovsky" this time, which will return to Vladivostok, marks the first export of a Soviet steamer after the resumption of diplomatic ties. Sino-Soviet trade is gradually improving, and measures have been established for Chinese citizens going to Vladivostok. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chinese Tea Transported to Russia</p>
<p>Chinese Tea, Sales in Russia</p>
<p>are substantial, especially tea bricks.</p>
<p>The outbound volume is large, often several thousand</p>
<p>tons. In the past, it was transported via the Chinese Eastern Railway to Russia. Now that the Northeast has been occupied by Japan, goods from Shanghai to Russia are all transported by sea. Since the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, Russia has come to China to purchase tea extensively. Tomorrow, the first regular Sino-Soviet steamer of the Soviet merchant fleet, the "Losovsky," will depart, carrying over four thousand tons of Chinese tea bricks, fully loaded, worth over a million yuan. This is the first large shipment of tea since the resumption of relations.</p>
<p>Chinese Citizens Going to Russia Before the resumption of diplomatic relations, Chinese citizens in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union were primarily in Vladivostok,</p>
<p>with several thousand</p>
<p>workers from Shandong province. The rest were mostly business operators. Many of them ceased operations and returned to China due to the country's taxation issues. There were very few Chinese in Vladivostok, and the entry restrictions were strict. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations, Chinese citizens going to Russia still require entry passports. However, before the Russian consulate in Shanghai is restored, an accommodating measure has been negotiated between our side and the Soviet authorities: Chinese citizens in Shanghai traveling to Vladivostok by ship must first obtain a passport from our Public Security Bureau, which is then forwarded to Dalian Bay to have it signed by the Russian consul stationed there, and returned to Shanghai. They can then board the ship to Vladivostok based on this passport. Without this passport, they will not be allowed to land.</p>
<p>Fixed Fares The Transportation Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway is the</p>
<p>general office in Shanghai managing the Soviet merchant fleet.</p>
<p>Commercial steamers traveling between China and Russia are all under the management of this office. As more Chinese citizens are traveling to Russia, fixed fares have been established for first, second, and third class passenger tickets on merchant ships traveling between Shanghai and Vladivostok. A first-class cabin from Shanghai to Vladivostok costs 100 yuan, and a third-class cabin from Shanghai to Vladivostok costs only 30 yuan. New regulations will be established after the official schedules for Sino-Russian passenger ships of the merchant fleet are determined.</p>
<p>Timber Arrives in Large Quantities Timber merchants in Shanghai have</p>
<p>placed orders for large quantities of timber</p>
<p>from the Soviet Union, and seven or eight batches</p>
<p>have already arrived successively, totaling over ten million feet. The shipment has not yet been completed. Now, another large batch of timber is being transported by the "Dao Yi" ship, which is scheduled to arrive at the port for unloading on the morning of the 27th, according to a telegram received yesterday.</p>
<p>Amid National Crisis</p>
<p>Duan's Painful Words</p>
<p>Refuses Birthday Celebrations, Doesn't Even Want to Hear the Word "Birthday"</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, a person close to Duan Zhiquan said yesterday that March 4th (the ninth day of the second lunar month) is Duan's 69th birthday. Acquaintances in Shanghai, such as Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Yuejun, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin, planned to initiate a public celebration, but Duan politely declined. Duan believes that today the nation is nearly in a perilous state. It's like being careless and getting robbed. One should be busy putting out the fire and defending against robbers, and should not have the leisure to engage in leisurely activities. Moreover, he has never celebrated a birthday in his life. As for today, he not only does not want to celebrate a birthday, but doesn't even want to hear the word "birthday." He will also refuse to accept any birthday screens, couplets, poems, or the like. Those who understand him will understand, and so on.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Duan Qirui first temporarily resided in the World Society on Ferguson Road. Later, he found the former residence of Chen Diaoyuan at No. 1487 on Avenue Joffre and plans to move in soon. A reporter from the Shen Shi Telegraph Agency met with Xu Shiying yesterday, who said that Duan is scheduled to move into his new residence today (the 25th). In addition, Duan has recently suffered from a mild abdominal illness and has engaged Wang Zhongqi, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from his hometown of Anhui, for treatment. He rarely receives guests. The Ministry of Communications Issues a Circular Urging Caution in Employing Seamen</p>
<p>Those Without Certificates Are Not Allowed to Be Hired</p>
<p>Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed If Violations Are Discovered</p>
<p>Recently, after the accidents involving the "Xin Ning," "Tai Da Yun," and other ships, which resulted in the drowning deaths of large numbers of people, the Ministry of Communications, out of concern for the safety of lives, has decided that seamen without nautical knowledge and experience and those who have not been examined and certified by the Ministry will not be allowed to be employed. A circular was issued yesterday to Shanghai, ordering the shipping industry association to comply. The original text is as follows: Circular on Compliance Matters: It has been clearly stipulated in the Commercial Ship Officer Certificate Regulations and Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Seamen Management promulgated by the Ministry that seamen must not serve without holding certificates. This is because the quality of seamen's skills is related to the safety of navigation. Those who have not been examined and qualified by the Ministry and given certificates can hardly be competent. Recently, there have been frequent incidents and accidents involving ships on the rivers and seas. The reasons are complex, but one of the reasons is the employment of seamen without certificates. This should be stopped to ensure safety. In addition to separate orders, this is also ordered to the association to forward to all shipping companies to comply. In the future, all seamen who have not obtained certificates from this Ministry are not allowed to be hired. If violations are discovered, they will be severely investigated and punished without leniency. This order.</p>
<p>Water Cutoff Dispute Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors will definitely discuss the water supply issue at length at next Wednesday's meeting. The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, in order to prepare for coping with the situation, has also scheduled a meeting on the 27th (next Monday) to discuss how to deal with the environment and resolve the dispute. The Shuncheng Lane Refusal to Cut Off Water Committee yesterday sent representatives Zhou Binzhang and others to submit letters to various agencies and important organizations to petition. The original text reads: Petition for cutting off water and starvation, requesting to save lives. Since the water supply to Shuncheng Lane and other areas in Yangshupu was cut off on February 16, residents have been unable to cook, causing widespread panic. Shanghai is densely populated with Chinese factories, and residents are dense, with workers making up the majority. Their knowledge is very limited. If this continues for a long time, unfortunate tragedies may occur. Therefore, residents have organized the "Shanghai Pudong Shuncheng Lane and Other Refusal to Cut Off Water Committee" to appeal to all parties. Therefore, this petition is submitted for your consideration, requesting prompt relief, which would be a great virtue.</p>
<p>The 6th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation yesterday sent</p>
<p>a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association General Federation of Citizens' Federation, stating: We respectfully report that recently, tenants Sheng Xinru, Qiu Jialiang, Chen Baoxing, Zhang Hechun, Chen Xintian, etc. from Jingqing Lane on Xihua De Road wrote to us stating that since the water company cut off the water supply on the morning of the 20th, they have been unable to obtain water and have had to elect Qiu Jialiang and others as representatives to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to temporarily use the Taiping tap on the roadside at the entrance of the lane for emergency use. As a result, those fetching water all day are extremely crowded, causing disputes and fights. The area is densely populated and the danger is extremely high, making tragedies difficult to avoid. Therefore, they came to the association to request filing for record, respectfully requesting your association's assistance and a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council stating that if a tragedy occurs in that area due to the water cutoff, the water company should bear full responsibility. Therefore, they request to maintain the previous situation and hope that the original state will be restored to avoid disputes and maintain peace. Accordingly, we hereby send a letter for your reference and handling. Truly a public matter.</p>
<p>Estonian Independence Day</p>
<p>A Grand Celebration Banquet Held by Estonians</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the 15th anniversary of the declaration of independence of Estonia, a country on the Baltic coast of Europe. Estonians in Shanghai gathered at the Astor House Hotel at 8:30 PM for a grand celebration banquet. Estonia is one of the newly emerging small countries after the European War. Its establishment is relatively recent. Previously, due to its strategic location between major powers, it had been under the control of Germanic, Danish, Swedish, and Russian countries since the 13th century, but it retained its autonomous status. After the European War, it, along with Finland, Lithuania, and Latvia, separated from Russia and formed a democratic republic government. Various ethnic minorities in the country, such as Russians, Germans, Swedes, and Jews, enjoy full rights. The authorities pay particular attention to education and culture, so there are no illiterates in the country. The people are fond of music, and a national singing festival is held every four years. The number of participants, including hymn singers and musicians, has reached 16,000, which can be said to be a grand occasion. There are a total of 117 Estonians in Shanghai, of whom 17 hold positions such as ship captains.</p>

After the Fierce Battle Began</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to Zhang Tang</p>
<p>Urging Perseverance and Self-Control, Not to Be Discouraged by Small Setbacks</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang in Beiping and Tang Yulin in Rehe. The original text reads: To Acting Committee Member Zhang of the Beiping Military Branch and Chairman Tang of Chengde, please forward to the soldiers at the front: We previously received a telegram, expressing loyalty and patriotism. We are deeply moved. The battle has just begun, and there will be times of advantage and disadvantage. We hope that you will persevere and maintain self-control, not be discouraged by small setbacks, and donate funds to repay the country. The people of the whole country share this sentiment. Do not let the generals bear the difficulties alone. Respectfully, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Issues an Open Letter to Merchants Nationwide</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued an open letter to chambers of commerce nationwide, stating: Since the September 18th Incident, we have lost three provinces with our hands tied due to repeated concessions, creating an unprecedented painful history of opening up the sea border. The whole country laments this. Although patriots and people of noble aspirations in the three provinces have risen up and fought the enemy, their efforts have not saved the critical situation in the three provinces. This is because foreign wars require concentrated strength and national unity. Relying solely on the people to fight on their own results in a scattered situation and weak backing, which is not enough to resist the full force of a strong enemy. For more than a year, the government has been focusing all its energy on diplomacy, hoping to recover lost territories without war. Who knew that the enemy's flames would grow stronger and their plans would become more urgent? They plan to include the Rehe region in their territory and seize it, plotting to gradually divide and cause the sinking of China. Therefore, the government, unable to bear it any longer, authorized the military authorities in North China to concentrate troops and make a last stand. Dean Song also made trips to Beiping and Chengde to raise military funds and comfort the soldiers. At the same time, it telegraphed the League of Nations, expressing its attitude. All these situations can be said to have broken the stagnant and contradictory situation of the past year and opened up a tragic and fierce path from now on. The people and the government are in the same leaky boat and cannot simply maintain an attitude of watching the fire from across the river and stand purely in a position of criticism and observation. Therefore, if the government has not decided on a major plan for resisting the war, the people should urge it. If the government is determined to carry out the anti-Japanese campaign, the people should fully support it. The actions of the invading country are the culmination of its decades of policy. The mobilization of 60 million people should be met with the efforts of our 400 million people. We must save on clothing and food, endure hardship, and store every bit of resources to support the military and resist Japan, so that the morale is always fresh and the front line is stable, which may save the critical situation and make the invaders aware. We hope that the government will be like Wen Tianxiang, and we must first hope that the people can be like Han Buxi, destroying their homes to relieve the national crisis. Merchants are at the forefront of this. We are willing to fulfill our responsibility with a spirit of not shirking responsibility. National sentiments and the consolidation of the country are the duties that our country's merchants should fulfill today. Let us encourage each other.</p>
<p>The Sui Provincial Government Sends Personnel</p>
<p>to Participate in the Soviet Russian Industrial Survey Group</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, after the news of the organization of the Soviet Russian Industrial Survey Group by prominent figures in the industrial sector of this city was released, it has aroused deep attention from the electrical industry throughout the country.

Shanghai already has such an organization and is recruiting participants from all walks of life to conduct on-site investigations. Suiyuan borders Mongolia and is close to Soviet Russia. Most of the goods traded are for trade. This government plans to send one person to participate and orders the provincial federation of chambers of commerce to send one more person to assist.

Some rice merchants have also requested to use six-dou measuring instruments. This was proposed at the 39th meeting of the Food Commission. Before the new municipal measure is adopted in customs and rice producing areas, it is proposed to temporarily allow the use of six-dou measuring instruments. For other commission fees, miscellaneous fees, etc., except for those calculated by bag, they should still be proportionally reduced. It has been reported to the municipal government for submission to the Ministry of Industry for record. After the municipal government received the report, in addition to ordering a reply, it has also forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry for record.</p>

<p>Accident at Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1</p>
<p>Boiler Explosion Traced to Japanese Product</p>
<p>Chinese Boiler Remained Intact</p>
<p>Workers' Compensation to Be Decided at Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Charred Bodies Collected Separately Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the tragedy at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 on Tangshan Road in Pudong, the factory began a three-day religious ceremony to pray for the deceased yesterday. The issue of compensation for the deceased workers will be decided at a shareholders' meeting after the investigation is completed. Reporters visited the factory at the end of Tangshan Road yesterday and investigated the cause of the accident. It has been learned that the factory has four steam boilers. The cause of the accident was a sudden explosion of the steam boiler located below the female workers' area. The female workers' area immediately collapsed in the explosion, and the flames spread rapidly, making it impossible for the female workers to escape. Fewer than 20% survived. According to the factory's war workers, the small steam boiler and the large steam boiler were made by the Xinmin Machinery Factory and remained intact even after the fire. This shows that the cause of the accident was entirely due to the inferior quality of Japanese goods sold to deceive people and proves the progress of China's machinery industry in recent years. The solidity of its structure and materials is indeed far superior to Japanese goods.</p>
<p>The North Gate Pushan Villa previously collected a large number of charred male and female corpses from the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road in Pudong, temporarily placing them in coffins and transporting them to the villa for placement. For days, the families of the victims have been going to identify them. There are a total of 81 charred bodies. Three of them have been claimed by the families of the deceased. Yesterday, another eight bodies were identified by various families: (1) Ding Yuqin, female, from Boshan, Shandong; (2) Shen Minggui, male, from Qingyang; (3) Yu Renjin, male, also from Qingyang; (4) Ren Yongtang, male, from Jiangyin; (5) Zhu Simei, female, from Qingyang; (6) The mother of Zhang Lindi, female, local; (7) Zhang Damei, female, from Changzhou, 30 years old. The remaining male and female corpses are all charred, missing heads, hands, feet, or all four limbs, or only the abdomen remains, or intestines are flowing out of the abdomen. Various tragic scenes are unbearable to look at. Several of them have abdomens as large as buckets, resembling pregnant female corpses, which is extremely sad. They cannot be identified. Therefore, Wang Junsheng, the director of the villa, Yu Ruizhang, the accountant, and dozens of workers were assigned to collect the bodies. The coffins were purchased by the factory from the Jiangyin Guild Hall, costing 36 yuan each. The bottom of the coffin is lined with lime and grass. Each corpse is wrapped in silk and cotton, and covered with silk floss bedding on top and bottom. The bodies are then covered with sesame oil before being placed in the coffin. According to the staff of the villa, the corpses that cannot be identified will be transported by workers in cars to the Jiangyin Guild Hall cemetery near Dachan for burial.</p>
<p>The fire at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road injured and killed more than 200 workers, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The Party and government organs in this city are investigating the matter. The Central Civil Movement Committee also sent a telegram to the Municipal Party Committee, requesting to ascertain the truth. The General Labor Union in this city is paying particular attention to this matter. Yesterday, it specifically sent Executive Committee Member Gong Yuting to the factory to inquire about the fire and the workers' compensation matters. It is said that it will be proposed at today's regular meeting of the union for serious discussion and expression. In addition, rubber factory workers in District 1 also issued a declaration on the case yesterday.</p>
<p>Not Satisfied After Robbery</p>
<p>Abducted the Victim's Young Son</p>
<p>The Maid Also Disappeared at the Same Time</p>
<p>The Police Suspect It</p>
<p>Hu Henian, from Shaoxing, lives at No. 493 at the intersection of Huishan Road and Jingzhou Road in this city. His wife, Zhang, has a son and a daughter. His son, Guoan, is about to turn one year old. He hired a maid two months ago to do chores. Hu has been working as a securities runner at the World Bank on Fuzhou Road for many years. At around 1:40 AM yesterday, while Hu and his wife were fast asleep, four robbers suddenly came, one holding a pistol. They rushed upstairs and broke into Hu's bedroom. They first woke up Hu and his wife and demanded that they hand over their valuables. Hu had nothing to offer. The robbers then searched him and stole more than 20 yuan in cash and a gold watch. However, the robbers were not satisfied. They forced Hu to go with them. Hu told them that he was an ordinary person and that it would be useless to take him. Then, the robbers locked Hu and his wife in the back room and bolted it with wooden chopsticks. Then, they turned around and took Hu's young son, Guoan. After the robbers left, Hu and his wife shouted for help. The neighbors heard them and quickly got up to investigate and released Hu and his wife. They checked the room and found that the young son was missing. At the same time, the maid they had hired was also missing. They rushed to report to the Yulin Road police station. The police chief sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and determined that the maid had disappeared suddenly during the robbery in the middle of the night and was highly suspicious. Moreover, the doors and windows were intact, with no signs of forced entry, indicating that there must have been an accomplice inside. Detectives were sent to the original employment agency to investigate the maid's background and apprehend the robbers.</p>
<p>Outside Wusongkou</p>
<p>Patrol Ships Seize Bandit Vessels</p>
<p>Land and Sea Police Surround from Four Sides</p>
<p>Guns and Sand Boats All Intercepted</p>
<p>The incident of pirates resisting arrest outside Wusongkou's Beigang sea area and being repelled by patrol ships has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the captain of the 17th team of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Team, who is also the commander of the fleet, Xi Mianqin, and the captains of the "Cedian" gunboat, Lu Gongren, the "Jingdong" gunboat, Chen Zhentai, and the "Junhe" gunboat, Captain Zhang, as well as the "Jinghai" and "Pingyang" ships, were sailing through the East Sea. They saw a large sailboat ahead, carrying sixty or seventy people who appeared to be soldiers. The situation was very suspicious. The sand boat opened fire to resist arrest. Commander Gong, Captain Chen of the "Jingdong" ship, Captain Lu of the "Cedian" ship, and Captain Zhang of the "Junhe" ship jointly attacked from the left and right. The sailboat sped to the beach, where they landed and waded ashore. Commander Gong immediately telegraphed the Qidong County government. County Magistrate Fei immediately sent the nearby police captain Yin and the squadron leader Guan to lead their teams to pursue them overnight, surrounding them from four sides. They were finally intercepted and all firearms were confiscated. The seized sand boat and crew were handed over to the county government for detention and investigation by the fleet. Yesterday [blank] Stolen Goods Injured People Son of Famous Actress Xia Yuerun</p>
<p>Xia Bingjun's Home Robbed at Midnight</p>
<p>Bingjun and His Wife Were Both Seriously Injured and in Critical Condition</p>
<p>The Thieves Escaped Through the Window The Police Arrived After They Had Fled</p>
<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday, a case of armed robbery and shooting occurred on Nanche Station Branch Road, which is under the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of Nanshi. The victim was the eldest son of the famous actress Xia Yuerun. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Convoluted Residence Xia Bingjun, son of Xia, is from Anhui, 32 years old.</p>
<p>He currently resides at No. 161 Nanche Station Branch Road in Nanshi. He once worked at a can factory. Currently, he is unemployed at home. His wife, Chen Huizhen, is 29 years old. The residence at No. 161 is the ancestral property of Chen. The house is a three-story building located at the end of the alley, which is very convoluted. Xia and his wife live in the west wing room on the upper floor. The lower floor is rented to other households.</p>
<p>Sound of Knocking At around 2:40 AM yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Xia and his wife were fast asleep,</p>
<p>Suddenly hearing a knock on the door of the room, Xia</p>
<p>first heard it. Suspecting that it was a thief,</p>
<p>he coughed to scare them away. However, the sound of knocking grew louder and louder. Xia then woke up his wife, put on his clothes, left the bed, and approached stealthily.</p>
<p>Three Shots Fired When Xia arrived at the door and hurriedly pulled the bolt to look outside,</p>
<p>the person who came was holding a pistol. Seeing</p>
<p>Xia come out, he raised his arm and lunged at him.</p>
<p>The two wrestled together. Inside the room, miscellaneous objects were overturned. At the same time, Chen also joined in the resistance. As a result, the thief was unable to defeat them and pulled the trigger, firing three shots at Xia and his wife.</p>

<p>Statement from the Silver Ear Mushroom Industry Association</p>
<p>The Industry Does Not Have Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver Ear Mushroom Industry Association sent a letter to this newspaper stating: We respectfully note that yesterday (the 23rd), your newspaper published a news item titled "Japanese-Produced White Wood Ear Mushroom," which was translated from the Japanese Tokyo Jiji Shinpo. We were extremely shocked to read it. The white wood ear mushrooms sold by our industry in this city are all transported from Tongjiang, Taiping, and other counties in Sichuan, and Zunyi County in Guizhou, and sold in Shanghai. This has been the case for sixty years, and we have never heard of Japanese goods, let alone traded with foreign merchants. As this matter concerns the promotion of domestic goods, it is urgent to clarify the truth. Accordingly, we send this letter to request that you publish a statement in the letters column. Respectfully, the Shanghai Silver Ear Mushroom Industry Association, February 24.</p>
<p>Guo Weiyi Seduces and Rapes Lin Yayue</p>
<p>The Trial Was Closed to the Public</p>
<p>Only News Reporters Were Allowed to Attend</p>
<p>But the Details Were Not Recorded</p>
<p>Lin Yayue, from Chaozhou, hired three lawyers, Wu Kaisheng, Cai Xiaobai, and Ni Jiong, and filed a criminal self-complaint in the Second Special District Court, accusing Guo Weiyi, a fellow townsman and manager and chairman of Watson's Soda Company, residing at No. 23 Deming Lane, Baishi Road, French Concession, of seducing and raping her in the bathroom on the afternoon of June 17, 1923, and then abandoning her. She requested an investigation and sought civil damages. The court originally scheduled the trial for the afternoon before yesterday, but it was postponed due to lack of time. The trial was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. The original plaintiff, Lin Yayue, and her representative, lawyer Cai Xiaobai, reported to the court. The defendant, Guo Weiyi, and his defense lawyer, Lu Shaozong, also reported to the court to await the trial. At 2:30 PM, Judge Tai Huiping and clerk Tao Zongkan presided over the trial in the Fifth Court. Relatives and friends of both parties flocked to the benches to listen to the trial. After the judge took the bench and summoned the original plaintiff and defendant to inquire about their ages, hometowns, occupations, and addresses, he announced that the case was related to public morals and closed the trial to the public. Only news reporters were allowed to attend as a courtesy. The judge then inquired about the circumstances of the rape from the original plaintiff, Lin Yayue. After the original plaintiff finished speaking, she raised her left hand and said that the jade gold ring she was wearing was given to her by the defendant at that time. Due to the trial being closed to the public, the details were not recorded. The defendant denied the seduction and rape, saying that the original plaintiff was bought by his wife in his hometown as a maid. Later, her mother came to take her back to marry her off. She objected and did not want to go back. Later, because her mother often went to his home in the countryside to make a fuss, she had to be taken back. She was persuaded and sent back, and her mother signed a receipt. Then, the defense lawyer submitted a red paper document to the court. The judge asked the original plaintiff, who said that her mother did not sell her to the defendant, but she was raised in his home to take care of the children. The judge then advised the defendant to settle the matter. The defendant refused to agree. At this point, the judge declared that the interrogation was over and ordered the closing arguments. The original plaintiff's lawyer, Cai, stated that of the three lawyers hired by the original plaintiff, Wu and Ni were not present today, and the complaint still needed to be corrected to include abandonment. The defendant's document also had doubts and needed to be proven by her mother. He requested a postponement. The defendant's lawyer stood up to object. The judge said to the original plaintiff's lawyer that the point of abandonment could be filed in another case and that closing arguments could be held today without postponement. Then, the lawyers of both sides argued with each other. The court ordered the closing arguments to be terminated and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 27th. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Li Zongtong</p>
<p>Discusses the First Batch of Antiquities Transported to Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Zongtong, Secretary-General of the Palace Museum, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the 2,118 boxes of the first batch of antiquities transported south from the Palace Museum, the location of the storage had previously been decided by the Central Political Committee to be transported to Kaifeng and Luoyang for storage. Because it was difficult to find a suitable location in Kaifeng and Luoyang, the final decision was made to place them in the new building next to the Central Hospital in Nanjing. It has been decided to transport them to Beijing today (i.e., yesterday) via Pukou. As for the date of the south-to-north transportation of the first batch of antiquities, it will be determined after the vehicles transporting the first batch of antiquities return north. The quantity is difficult to predict, but it is known that various precious antiquities from the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will also be transported in the second batch. Although the number of antiquities in the Antiquities Exhibition Hall is 70% less than that of the Palace Museum, the famous bronze ware are all from the Song and Ming dynasties, and the portraits of emperors of past dynasties are even rarer.</p>
<p>Chicago Exposition</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Chicago Exposition has been prepared for many years, and the collection is very broad. The scale of its grandeur and the splendor of the venue are rare in history. It is now scheduled to open on June 1. Many national government groups and business circles have sent personnel to participate. The China Travel Service on Sichuan Road in this city has been serving travelers for many years and is particularly experienced in handling overseas procedures and booking ship tickets. Therefore, those who participate in various sectors have already reserved cabins at the agency in advance. The agency offers special discounts to these passengers, and all accompanying luggage is sent to the ship free of charge to express gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e8">League of Nations to Hear Further, Continued from Page 3 <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The foundation of the original covenant is about to be destroyed. Mr. Li concluded by saying, "This structure already shows signs of being unable to support itself. The hope of reducing world armaments has been jeopardized. The work of establishing international economic cooperation has been expanded. For these reasons, we must now vote to pass the Special Committee's report." The Venezuelan representative, Mr. Soumaye, then spoke, saying that whenever the League of Nations' mechanisms were faithfully and bravely put into use, effective results occurred. However, deviating from the covenant would hinder the possibility of a permanent solution. Now, there is bloody conflict in both the West and the East, as if the covenant did not exist. Observing the development of this conflict, it is felt that the covenant needs to be revised, and strengthening international jurisdiction and mediation under the supervision of the League of Nations is indeed necessary. However, any procedure that allows the state of violence that has existed since 1931 to persist and even increase should not be permitted. Delaying is not the best way to achieve peace; this kind of procedure is particularly dangerous." Finally,</p>
<p>The Lithuanian representative, Mr. Zaunius, spoke, urging the League of Nations Assembly to continue its efforts without slackening, and said that since mediation procedures have already been exhausted, appropriate and necessary plans should be adopted thereafter. In any case, once the report is passed, it must not become a mere formality. The result of the vote was unanimous passage. Chairman Hymans then</p>
<p>Announced the decision to vote and read out the articles of the covenant, explaining that "unanimous" means all members of the Administrative Council (excluding the disputing countries) plus a majority of the members of the League of Nations Assembly. Thereupon, a roll-call vote was taken, with forty-two countries in favor and only Japan against. Siam did not vote, and several countries were absent. After the vote, Hymans announced that the report had been passed unanimously.</p>
<p>Halting War Based on the Covenant and Reading out the Covenant</p>
<p>Article 15, Section 6, states that member states agree not to engage in war against a party that complies with the recommendations of the report. Article 12 of the covenant was also read out, stipulating that war may not be engaged in until three months after the report has been issued. Hymans also said that he hopes both sides can accept the efforts of mediation and that neither side will take irreversible actions that would prolong the dispute. The League of Nations should continuously seek solutions and continue the work entrusted to it by the covenant.</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke Speaks for the Second Time</p>
<p>Then gave his second speech, expressing disappointment at the League of Nations' passage of this report, saying that Japan had participated in the work of drafting the League of Nations covenant and had worked with the world's major powers to achieve the highest purpose of uniting mankind. Japan was very proud of this. Japan's policy was fundamentally based on the idea of ensuring peace in the Far East and promoting peace throughout the world. He deeply lamented the current situation. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, Japan has now reached the limit of its willingness to cooperate with the League of Nations, but Japan is still willing to participate in work that contributes to world peace.</p>
<p>The Japanese Delegation Leaves the Venue One After Another, Matsuoka Speaks</p>
<p>After finishing his speech, the members of the Japanese delegation left one after another. However, at that time, the meeting had already ended, and some people in the venue had already gotten up from their seats, so the impact of the Japanese delegation leaving the venue was not very noticeable. However, the Japanese delegation's posture was clearly understood. Anyone who knew the relationship was deeply impressed.</p>
<p>Matsuoka, Pale-Faced, Leads the Way Matsuoka's Face</p>
<p>Was pale, but he still had a resolute demeanor. Matsuoka led the way, followed closely by the other Japanese representatives. The seven or eight Japanese representatives attending the Disarmament Conference also followed behind. The crowd was crowded at the entrance of the venue. The Japanese delegation walked straight ahead through the crowd, not looking left or right. The only Japanese person left behind in the venue was Sugimura, who was a secretary of the League of Nations. Examining the intent of the Japanese representatives' words, it is still questionable whether Japan will sever relations with the League of Nations. However, it is generally expected that the Japanese government will take action to indicate this, presumably by directly notifying the Secretariat of its views. The General Assembly Adjourns and Will Continue in the Afternoon Hymans Announces</p>
<p>That the General Assembly will continue in the afternoon at 5:00 PM to discuss a certain point mentioned in the report (presumably regarding the establishment of a negotiating committee) and to accept a document. The full text of the report will be officially sent to the representatives of the United States and Russia stationed in Geneva, asking them to work with the League of Nations as quickly as possible to take consistent action.

<p>To Continue Handling the Sino-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>Inviting the US and Russia to Participate in the Work</p>
<p>The General Assembly Will Not Adjourn and Can Be Convened at Any Time</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly continued its meeting tonight. Our country's representative, Mr. Gu, spoke and gave a detailed account of the serious situation in Jehol. The General Assembly has passed a resolution to organize an advisory committee to assist the General Assembly in continuing to handle the Sino-Japanese conflict. The advisory committee will be composed of the members of the original Nineteen-Nation Special Committee and representatives from Canada and the Netherlands, and will invite the US and Russia to participate in the work. The General Assembly will remain in session and can be convened at any time the presiding officer deems necessary. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th, 2:30 AM)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman Hymans presented a draft resolution as follows: The League of Nations General Assembly, in accordance with Article 3, Section 3 of the Covenant, may deal with any event that hinders world peace at any meeting. Therefore, it cannot turn a blind eye to the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute. In accordance with Section 17 of Chapter 3 of the report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant, member states of the League of Nations must not take unilateral action regarding the situation in Manchuria and must continue to act in concert with each other and with relevant non-member states. In order to facilitate the establishment of a situation in the Far East that is in accordance with the recommendations in the report, the Secretary-General is now instructed to send a copy of this report to the non-member states that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, informing them of the League of Nations General Assembly's hope that these countries will endorse the report's views and, if necessary, take consistent action and attitude with member states of the League of Nations. The League of Nations General Assembly decided to organize an advisory committee to monitor the situation and assist the League of Nations General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities under Article 3, Section 3 of the Covenant, with the aim of supporting member states in taking consistent action with each other and with non-members, so as to be in line with their attitude.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee will be composed of the members of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee and representatives from Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee will invite the governments of the United States and Russia to participate in its work and will submit reports and recommendations when it deems appropriate, and will notify the governments of non-member states participating in the work of its reports. The League of Nations General Assembly will remain in session, and its chairman, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, may convene it when he deems appropriate. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Diplomacy Plunges into Isolation</p>
<p>No Representative Attends the Afternoon Assembly</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly resumed its meeting tonight. No Japanese person was present in the venue, reminding people of the discussion made by Chairman Hymans when reporting on the voting situation, who said, "Our proposal has been rejected by one of the parties, and that country seems to want to retreat into a position of isolation and pursue its policy without regard to the opinions of other countries." The countries included in the composition of the negotiating committee are Germany, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, and Turkey, totaling twelve countries, which are listed in the report, thus completing the report.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Japanese Secretary Sugimura has now resigned. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation at the League of Nations General Assembly, which continued today, is clearly unfavorable to Japan. Although various Japanese government departments are putting up a last-minute struggle, the atmosphere in the Japanese Foreign Ministry still shows signs of decline. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has now convened a department meeting to await Matsuoka's important report. All procedures for withdrawing from the League of Nations have been prepared, but the date must await a decision at an extraordinary emergency cabinet meeting to be convened tomorrow, which will then be submitted to the Privy Council for review before formally submitting the procedures to the League of Nations.

<p>Stimson is Willing to Cooperate with the New Government</p>
<p>No Change in US Far East Policy</p>
<p>The Authorities' Assurance to the Japanese Ambassador is Considered Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Some Advocate Withdrawing Troops from Tianjin to Avoid Conflict</p>
<p>(Washington) The future new government of the United States is closely studying the Far Eastern situation, and the future Secretary of State, Mr. Hull, is also listening to his directions at the State Department. Mr. Hull replied to accept the good intentions, saying that he would immediately take this opportunity to cooperate with Mr. Stimson. It is generally believed that this move is an indication that the general foreign policy of the United States will continue without interruption. The current State Department is still tight-lipped about the proceedings in Geneva and has not expressed any attitude towards Japan's attack on Jehol. According to a friend of Roosevelt, Mr. Roosevelt does not intend to make any statement on these issues in his inaugural address. Even if he mentions the dignity of treaties, it will be brief and cautious if it involves the Far Eastern situation. (National News dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) A certain cabinet member of the US government advocated withdrawing the US 15th Infantry Regiment stationed in Tianjin, China, to avoid the possibility of conflict with the Japanese army. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Debuchi, assured the State Department that the Japanese military action would not extend to mainland China unless someone provoked it, and stated that Japan's plans, if not provoked, were only to expel the Jehol Chinese Propaganda Team and clear up the informal troops and volunteer army there, and had no intention of advancing south of the Great Wall. However, the cabinet member still believed that the Japanese assurance was unsatisfactory. If a dispute were to arise in Tianjin over a minor matter, the position of the US military would be very difficult to deal with. A slight carelessness could lead to an international incident. Therefore, he advocated a temporary withdrawal. However, it is heard that the Army Department has not taken any action on this proposal. At present, it has only instructed the commander stationed in Tianjin to be extremely cautious. (National News dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>US Educators</p>
<p>Demand Recognition of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Petition to Roosevelt</p>
<p>TASS dispatch from New York, 23rd: Eight hundred American professors, university presidents, and teachers, representing 268 universities and specialized schools in 45 states of the United States, recently submitted a petition to President-elect Roosevelt, requesting the United States to recognize the Soviet Union. The petition stated, "This is an indispensable step regarding world peace and the mutual economic interests of the two countries." Several of the signatories to this petition are well-known American scientists and economists, such as Professor Meek, Dean of the Experimental College of the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Dewey, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, Mr. Neilson, President of Smith College in Massachusetts, Dr. Commons, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Wisconsin, Professor Hudson, Professor of International Law at Harvard University, Professor Williams, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Patterson, Professor of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Niebuhr, one of the initiators of this petition, said, "Under the current emergency situation, the United States' failure to recognize the Soviet Union will pose a serious threat to world peace." He hopes that this petition will be sufficient to increase the tendency of Americans to care about and understand the Soviet Union, and hopes that the government and parliament will take appropriate steps in response to the submission of this petition.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Expresses</p>
<p>Supplying Japanese Military Supplies is a Crime</p>
<p>Sufficient Assistance Should Be Provided to Countries Defending Themselves</p>
<p>And Cites the Story of Greece to Urge Japan to Wake Up</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lytton gave a speech in Norwich, England, today, mentioning the situation in the East, saying that stopping the export of military supplies would not pose any difficulty. He saw no reason why Britain should not supply China with military supplies. However, to prevent the military supplies to China from falling into the hands of Japan would not be easy. It is simply a crime for the government of a member state of the League of Nations to allow its citizens to continue selling military supplies to a country, enabling it to continue a war that is recognized by the world as unjust. Moreover, the League of Nations is bound by its own report and must provide all kinds of assistance to the other party. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lytton told a Daily Telegraph reporter today that the British government cannot impose an embargo on its own. It must first seek the consent of other members of the League of Nations before it can act. Britain initiated the conclusion of an international agreement, and no one can stop it, saying that it is inconceivable that any member state of the League of Nations can supply military supplies to either of the two countries in dispute while this dispute is under consideration by the League of Nations. If a ban is implemented, a clause should be added to the League of Nations Covenant to prohibit any member state from transporting military supplies to any other member state under consideration by the League of Nations. The Labour Party's demand not to sell military supplies to Japan is extremely legitimate. However, if other countries continue to transport military supplies for export, why should Britain be the only one to prohibit it? If the arms trade continues, why should Britain sacrifice its own interests to benefit other countries? Lord Lytton continued, saying that Japan has good reasons for the Manchurian case, but the actions it has taken are simply unreasonable and unwarranted. Lord Lytton also cited the position of Greece after the Greco-Turkish War, saying that at that time, the League of Nations' official, Mr. Venizelos, had gone astray, but before long, the Greeks overthrew their government and replaced it with a government with a new policy. Japan is now effectively ruled by warlords. All of Japan's friends now hope that the Japanese can take the same action. Now, as long as a mutually satisfactory solution is obtained, peace is still possible. The only solution is to completely remove the military equipment from the three eastern provinces, so that a capable police force commanded by foreign personnel can maintain order there. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express commented on the issue of banning military exports, saying, "If China or Japan entrusts a third country to purchase military supplies from England on their behalf, how will this be prevented? What is the definition of 'military supplies'? How will we deal with railway materials, oil, rubber, steel, chemicals, grain, textiles, leather boots, medicines, and other items necessary for war used to transport troops? If all are placed in the category of military supplies and banned, it is tantamount to implementing an economic boycott." (Reuters dispatch, 24th) Japanese Conspiracy to Burn Down</p>
<p>Soviet Aviation Station in Kamchatka</p>
<p>Instigator Arrested, Confession Confirmed</p>
<p>(Moscow) A report from Berlik mentioned that on January 19th, the Soviet civil aviation station in Ust-Bolsheryotsk, Kamchatka, suddenly caught fire. After investigation, it was found that the fire was deliberately set by Trofimov, a member of the local defense team assigned to guard the station, with the assistance of Prigov, another member of the defense team. Later, it was found that the two's arson was instigated by Serivalov, the shopkeeper of a local state-run farm. Serivalov was previously a monk. After examining the crimes of the three, it was found that they were also instigated by Jieze, a Japanese resident in Ust-Bolsheryotsk. Jieze was subsequently arrested. According to Jieze's confession, the confessions of Trofimov and Prigov were accurate. However, he was also ordered by another Japanese person to destroy the Soviet civil aviation station and other important state-owned buildings in Ust-Bolsheryotsk.

<p>Questions about the Safety of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, a member of parliament asked Foreign Secretary Simon whether, in view of the seriousness of the situation in Jehol, he had ordered all British expatriates in the province to withdraw completely, and whether, as the Japanese army was about to invade North China, it was advisable to order all British expatriates in the counties of Hebei Province to withdraw and concentrate in Peiping or Tianjin. The Foreign Secretary replied that he had no authority to order British expatriates to withdraw. He could only give them advice. It is most appropriate for the British ambassador and consular officials in China to decide on the safety of the situation on the ground. They can advise British expatriates to withdraw from turbulent or dangerous areas at any time. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>British Parliament</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with Simon's Measures</p>
<p>Will Move to Reduce Salary as a Punishment</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons will begin debating the Far East issue on Monday, when debating the external budget proposal. The first step will be a formal motion to reduce Foreign Secretary Simon's salary. According to the British Parliament's custom, a motion to reduce a cabinet minister's salary is an expression of dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures regarding a certain event. The opposition wants Britain to immediately ban the export of military supplies to the Far East, but the government believes that unless it obtains the cooperation of other military supply exporting countries, Britain's imposition of this ban will not be helpful. The British government also stated that it is currently making every effort to immediately investigate the possibility of seeking such international cooperation. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Japan Sending Overtures to the Netherlands</p>
<p>Proposing to Conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Promising the Navy Not to Invade Dutch Islands</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations General Assembly ordered Matsuoka Yosuke, by order of Foreign Minister Uchida, to go to the Netherlands to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Dutch Foreign Ministry. The Japanese side stated that if something happened in the Far East, the Japanese Navy would not invade the Dutch colonies in the South Seas, and asked the Netherlands not to advocate the recovery of the South Seas Islands under Japanese mandate in the League of Nations. At the same time, they implored the Dutch government to step up its suppression of overseas Chinese and donate money to help China resist Japan. It is still difficult to predict whether Matsuoka Yosuke's mission will achieve its purpose. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>After the news that he came to the Netherlands for a visit before returning home, the Dutch newspapers continued to carry today that Matsuoka would discuss the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Netherlands, because the Japanese cabinet was seeking new alliances and assistance in the Far East. Therefore, Matsuoka will seek to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the Dutch East Indies and Japanese territory. The newspapers did not mention whether the scope of discussion proposed by Matsuoka would include the mandated islands in the Pacific.

<p>Chairman Chiang is Determined to</p>
<p>Complete the Suppression of Communists in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>All Departments in Fu River Have Completed Their Concentration, with Extremely Strong Military Strength</p>
<p>There are Time Limits for the Advance of Each Army</p>
<p>300,000 Troops Can Be Drawn to Resist Japan One Month Later</p>
<p>(Nanchang) In addition to directing the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, Chiang makes decisions on anti-Japanese military affairs at any time. Xu Xiangqian and He Long are currently besieged on the borders of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. The main forces of Zhu De and Mao Zedong, who fled to Lichuan, Nanfeng, and the southeast, relying on the border of Fujian and the area of Guangchang, can be resolved. All departments in Fu River have completed their concentration, with extremely strong military strength. Wang Jinwen passed through Jinxi, Zhou Hunyuan conquered Bokan, and after attacking, the bandit areas in southeastern Jiangxi can be recovered in one fell swoop. On the western Jiangxi front, the Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan armies launched a general offensive against Li Tianzhu's Pseudo-Eighth Army. The troops passed through Pingxiang and Lianhua, and the Guangdong troops arrived in Suichuan. The troops are also advancing westward. Chiang is determined to complete the suppression of the communists in the shortest possible time. If Jehol and Shanhaiguan can hold out for more than a month, the task of suppressing the communists in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian will be completed, and 300,000 troops can be drawn to resist Japan. In addition, Chiang has time limits for the tasks and advances of each department, and the progress is very rapid. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Implementation of Literacy Education for the Public</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenwen, the Director of the Education Department of Fujian Province, regards the literacy movement as a crucial aspect of public education and pays exceptional attention to its implementation. He has thoroughly reviewed and finalized the General Outline of the Popular Literacy Education Plan, previously established by the Provincial Government. It has been submitted to the Provincial Affairs Council for approval and preparations have already begun. An excerpt of its contents is as follows:</p>
<p>The principle is to first designate Fuzhou City as a pilot area, and then divide the pilot area into appropriate locations as community experiment zones. All illiterate young people aged between twelve and twenty-five are to be compelled to attend school. The remaining districts will be promoted gradually. The study period is set at four months. Teaching staff will be comprised of government officials and education institution personnel to avoid any bias and ensure tangible results.</p>
<p>Organization: The Provincial Government will convene representatives from Party, government, military, academic, and social organizations to form a Popular Education Committee in the pilot area. They will work together to develop the undertaking, with the Chairman of the Provincial Government serving as Chairman and the Director of the Education Department as Vice-Chairman. A secretary will be appointed, along with various departments for general affairs, publicity, investigation, design, supervision, and inspection, ensuring that each duty has a specific responsible party and that matters are dealt with practically.</p>
<p>Publicity: A Popular Literacy Education Publicity Week will be held regularly to arouse the attention of literate citizens and encourage illiterate citizens to attend school. Efforts will be made to ensure that the methods are widespread and the impressions are profound.</p>
<p>Investigation: Following the Publicity Week, Saturday and Sunday will be selected as days for administrative agencies, schools, and social occupational organizations to assign personnel to form investigation teams to survey illiterate citizens within the area, aiming to ensure that no area is overlooked.</p>
<p>Design: There are detailed regulations regarding the formulation of literacy test standards, the division of experimental areas, the designation of public school locations, and the allocation of illiterate citizens to schools and teaching staff.</p>
<p>Funding: The total annual cost is 32,140 yuan, with monthly expenses of approximately 2,600 yuan. Two-thirds of the funds will be used for lighting and teaching materials, while one-third will be used for books, investigation certificates, publicity subsidies, and various administrative expenses.</p>
<p>Assessment: In addition to rewards for diligent teaching staff and penalties for those who are negligent, there will also be specific measures regarding the diligence and indolence of illiterate citizens during their schooling to ensure that tangible results are achieved within a reasonable period.</p>

<p>Attention to Female Education</p>
<p>Order to Municipal Public and Private Middle Schools</p>
<p>To Pay More Attention to the Discipline and Management of Female Students and Carefully Select Teachers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to public and private secondary schools yesterday, stating: "The education of women in this city is just beginning to sprout and should be cultivated with great care to promote its development. However, recent reports indicate that middle schools for girls in this city have not paid sufficient attention to the hiring of teachers and the discipline and management of students. The pursuit of academic knowledge between teachers and students has been largely neglected, and the practice of etiquette has also been overlooked. Female education is almost criticized by society. The deeply ingrained bad habits should be corrected as soon as possible. Hereafter, middle schools that accept both male and female students must follow the provisions of this Bureau's Order No. 1155 to separate male and female school buildings and hire excellent female instructors to reside in the school. For schools that are exclusively for girls, the hiring of teachers and staff should prioritize the recruitment of female personnel as much as possible. If it is necessary to hire male teachers and staff, their academic and moral conduct must be carefully investigated before hiring them, so that the conduct of the employed personnel can serve as a role model, subtly influencing and transforming students. Students' character will be guided on the right track, and the academic atmosphere will change so that the development of female schools can be expected. All schools under your jurisdiction must abide by this order. The Director of this Bureau has high expectations." This order is issued.</p>
<p>Research Fellows of the Academia Sinica Arrive in Guilin</p>
<p>Fossils from a Million Years Ago Discovered</p>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Li Jie, Zhu Sen, Qiu Liwo, and others, research fellows of the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica, were dispatched to the Hunan-Guangxi region to study the structure of the Nanling Mountains and the origins of ore beds in various locations. Since their departure, they have entered Guangxi from Hunan and conducted detailed investigations along the way, gaining many insights into the study of mountain ranges and ore beds. They arrived in Guilin and, on the 11th, discovered a large number of vertebrate fossils (commonly known as dragon bones) and snail and clam fossils in a cave outside the North Gate. It is said that these fossils are remnants of organisms from a million years ago and are from the same period as the red clay deposits around the city. The red soil layer is widely distributed in southern China, and its formation period has been studied by geologists from home and abroad, but has not yet been resolved. Now that these fossils have been obtained, the age of the red soil can be estimated. This discovery is a great contribution to geology in our country and is truly good news for the scientific community.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Educational Circles in Yunnan Province Raise Funds for Two Airplanes <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Education Department and Schools Deduct Administrative Expenses and Teachers' Salaries</p>
<p>University, Middle School, and Elementary School Students Raise Funds to Be Completed Within Three Months</p>
<p>The 95th consultation and discussion meeting of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education and the 30th regular meeting of the Third Committee of the Provincial Committee were held on the 6th as a joint meeting. Li Yongqing chaired the meeting, and Shao Run recorded the minutes. Matters discussed included: (1) Given the urgency of the national crisis, the educational circles of this province should initiate the raising of national salvation donations to provide resources for defense and aid national salvation. It was resolved that, in addition to making efforts in shame education and military training, the educational circles of the entire province should immediately practice frugality, appeal widely, and initiate the raising of national salvation donations with the goal of purchasing two fighter planes to contribute to the nation. The airplanes should be named "Yunnan Education" and "Yunnan Student" respectively. The purchase price should be based on raising more than one million old dollars. The methods for sharing the fundraising responsibilities are as follows: (1) The Department of Education, provincial schools, and educational institutions receiving provincial educational funding, as well as students studying abroad, will jointly raise more than 500,000 yuan. Starting in February, the Department of Education will deduct 20% of the department's funds each month. When schools and institutions apply for funds from the treasury, 20% will be deducted directly from the original amount. When collection agencies apply for red bonuses, 5% will be deducted directly. 2.5% will be deducted from the red bonuses of business agencies as donations, which will be saved in a special account by the treasury and remitted together with the principal and interest. However, temporary expenses with fixed amounts and the provisions for chaste women in the Jingjie Hall may not be deducted. For students studying abroad, 10% of their provincial fees and scholarships will be temporarily deducted from a certain month, and the Department will send letters to solicit the opinions of the students studying abroad before making a decision. The 20% deduction from schools and institutions includes personnel salaries and administrative expenses. After the deduction, personnel salaries will be reduced by 20%, and administrative expenses will also be tightly controlled by each school and institution, and expenditures will be made at 80% of the original amount. The internal allocation will be determined by the responsible personnel, but funds designated for specific purposes (such as library fees) can only be reduced by 20% according to the prescribed amount, and the remaining 80% will still be used for the prescribed purpose and reported, and cannot be misappropriated for other purposes. Military training expenses may not be reduced. In addition, all school and institutional personnel are also expected to donate freely according to their ability, and to solicit donations separately. Fundraising methods will be determined separately, and the fundraising will be reconsidered for suspension when more than 500,000 yuan has been raised. (2) Elementary school students throughout the province will be responsible for raising more than 100,000 yuan, with each student required to donate more than one yuan. This will be organized by the education bureaus of each county, city, and district and completed within three months, and delivered to the treasury of this department for verification and transfer. (3) University and middle school students throughout the province will be responsible for raising more than 100,000 yuan, with each student required to donate more than ten yuan. This will be organized by each school and completed within three months, and delivered to the treasury of this department for verification and group transfer. (4) Local education circles in counties, cities, and districts throughout the province will be responsible for raising 300,000 yuan, which will still be organized by each education bureau and completed and remitted within three months. However, if necessary, the full amount of elementary school education awards and bonuses will be used to cover expenses. (2) The program for the implementation of a full-time system in secondary schools throughout the province was resolved. Provincial schools in the provincial capital will implement the program step by step in accordance with the regulations. Provincial schools outside the province with three or more high school classes should treat the principal and part of the teachers according to high school standards. Those with less than three classes should treat the principal and all the teachers according to junior high school standards. Regardless of whether they are high or junior high schools, new full-time teachers who have just graduated from school and have not taught courses before should be paid from the lowest grade. For full-time teachers who have already been hired by various schools, a separate implementation sequence should be determined for those whose contracts have not yet expired this semester. As for part-time teachers in various schools, they should refer to the departmental regulations and be responsible for one-third of the extracurricular self-study guidance based on the number of teaching hours they are assigned. The detailed rules for handling the case were resolved, amended, and passed. (4) The municipal government designated various groups to organize the Former Anti-Japanese Association's Confiscated Goods Clearance Committee and sent a letter to inform the association to send personnel to participate. It was resolved to recommend Standing Director Huang Zaoxiong to participate as a representative. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Minutes of the County Education Bureau's Office Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 278th office meeting yesterday afternoon. All staff members attended, with Director Shi presiding and Pan Shengsan recording the minutes. Matters discussed included: (1) Chenxing Elementary School proposed to expand and add grades using tuition fees and requested instructions.

The additional teaching salaries and miscellaneous expenses required for this semester should be offset by the surplus tuition fees. (2) The principal of Tangwan Elementary School reported that the school's teacher, Ma Yiwen, requested a one-grade salary increase and requested instructions. It was resolved that, according to the salary standards for elementary school teachers in this county, there is no provision for ten-year increments.

(3) Committee Member Niu forwarded a request from Yuxiu Elementary School for an additional grade fee and requested instructions. It was resolved that the request could not be approved. However, the expenses are not much, so when the semester ends next month, a meritorious bonus will be given based on the inspection report and the average number of students actually attending to provide assistance. (4) Qiangshu Elementary School requested the allocation of temporary expenses for this semester and the surplus of the budgeted teaching salary for the last semester to cover repair expenses and requested instructions.

For the shortfall, the full amount of the temporary expenses of 91 yuan for this semester should be allocated. (5) Qiangshu Elementary School requested the addition of a first-grade classroom and requested instructions. It was resolved that the request could not be approved due to lack of funding. (6) The county government ordered the筹設 of a public stadium. (7) The county education association requested the establishment of a public stadium at the new治地點.

(8) Committee Member Niu forwarded a request from Wuquan Elementary School to add grades to help teachers supplement正敎加給職薪雜支 and requested instructions. It was resolved that the request would still be difficult to approve. However, the expenses are not much, so when the semester ends, a meritorious bonus should be given based on the inspection report and the number of students actually attending to provide assistance. (9) Committee Member Lin forwarded a request from Yucai Elementary School that the principal, having served for six full years, request an upgrade in salary and requested instructions. It was resolved that, calculated from January of the 18th year when the staff member obtained the qualification of 正敎員, the member has not yet reached the year for promotion, so the request cannot be temporarily approved. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The Municipal Education Bureau Drafts</p>

In the afternoons of the past two days, male and female athletes have been practicing in the Chinese basketball hall, hoping to win back the championship and restore the association's reputation.</p>
<p>Disappointing Women's Basketball Game</p>
<h3 id="e23">Two Rivers Defeated by Western United <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-one to Twenty-three</p>
<p>Two Rivers Team's Performance Significantly Diminished</p>
<p>Lu Lihua Claims Unfair Refereeing</p>
<p>The Two Rivers Women's Basketball Team was defeated again by the Western Youth United Team last night with a score of twenty-three to thirty-one. Two Rivers was inferior from beginning to end. The audience's enthusiasm was not very high. This was the second performance for Two Rivers in preparation for going abroad.</p>
<p>Two Rivers Constantly Under Pressure. From the start, after Chen Rongming of Two Rivers scored one point from a free throw, Western Youth immediately surged ahead, leading three to one. Then they took the lead with seven to three. Although Two Rivers fought hard, they still trailed seven to nine at the end of the first quarter. However, Two Rivers ultimately failed to maintain their position. The momentum of Western Youth grew stronger and stronger. Two Rivers was completely trampled, eventually losing by a score of seven to nineteen. The first half ended with eleven to twenty-one. In the second half, Western Youth made slight adjustments but did not diminish their performance, adding another four points. As a result of Two Rivers' hard fight, they gradually improved, narrowing the gap to only seven points, nineteen to twenty-six. However, the final result was a defeat of twenty-three to thirty-one.</p>
<p>Jesson Truly Delightful. Western Youth assembled stars from both the Red and Blue teams. Their speed in passing the ball and the tightness of their defense were astonishing. The coordination, positioning, and beautiful passing of the three forwards were superior to Two Rivers. Especially Jesson, who was the most outstanding, scoring twenty-three points, which was truly commendable and made him a star. The failure of Two Rivers was obviously due to bad luck in the game, and also due to panicking because of the setbacks, missing many shots that should have been made, and making too many mistakes, which were exploited by the opponents. The three forwards were completely helpless under strict guarding, which was quite unexpected. The retreat of the guards was also broken by the opponent's triangular passing, creating a disadvantageous situation.</p>
<p>Two Rivers Claims Unfair Refereeing. According to Lu Lihua, the principal of Two Rivers, the failure of Two Rivers was the responsibility of the unfair refereeing. The Westerners should have been penalized but were not, which was clearly biased, making the heroes of Two Rivers unable to use their skills. There are still two more games, and they will negotiate with the Western Youth Sports Department to hire other referees. It is noted that the referee last night was Bennet of Western Youth, who is also a major defender of the Pirates team.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Lessons from One Civil and One Military <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>China has recently received lessons from two foreign mentors, one civil and one military. The civil one, of course, is that oily-tongued old man, George Bernard Shaw. In Beijing, he said to reporters: "One strange characteristic of the Chinese is their incredible politeness and friendliness towards all foreigners, but among themselves, they are always so impolite and always fighting." He also said that the Great Wall is no different from an ordinary low wall.</p>
<p>The military one is the Japanese imperialists' cannons and airplanes that recently invaded Jehol. These cannons and airplanes are also laughing and saying to the Chinese: "You Chinese are so polite to foreigners and so impolite to your own people. You have given up tens of thousands of miles of the Northeast, and now this Jehol, after you get your war bonds and collect your support and慰勞 money, you will have to give it up again. The Great Wall was originally built to defend against foreign invasions, but now it has become a fortress and boundary line for foreigners. It can be considered a defense project built by the Chinese for foreigners."</p>
<p>On the one hand, thinking of the wars in Shandong, Sichuan, and Guizhou during the so-called national crisis, one cannot help but admire the accuracy of the lessons from these two foreign mentors. In the end, I can only copy two old poems and change them to praise the progress of my great Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Revised Book of Songs: Brothers fight at the wall, inviting external insults.</p>
<p>Copied poem mocking Li Hongzhang and Weng Tonghe: Fortunately, Xiang Hefei makes the world thin, the Grand Council of Changshu makes the common people barren.</p>
<p>Revised poem from the past praising the Great Wall: Qin built the Great Wall like an iron prison, at that time who knew how much labor it would take, pitifully on the third night of the first month, giving it away to others to use as trenches.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Hometown <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Like everyone who wanders outside has their own hometown, I also have my own hometown.</p>
<p>My hometown is neither a famous city nor a scenic spot. On the contrary, it is just a secluded little village. It is heavily surrounded on three sides by the remaining veins of Changbai Mountain, and on the other side it is close to the Yima River. This is a not-so-large valley mouth and a not-so-small plain, with mountains, water, and fertile fields, making it a very good farm, making it always envied and praised by the nearby farmers.</p>
<p>In winter and spring, the fields and mountain peaks are all covered with a thick layer of white snow, and the river water is also frozen with a thick layer of solid ice. At the end of spring, the snow gradually melts, the ice gradually disappears, and yellow grass is exposed everywhere. Then, green buds sprout, and the mountains and valleys, as well as the vast plains, are full of pleasing green; then, willow catkins fly, and it is time to start sowing. At this time, countless people are cultivating the fields, and flowers of various colors are blooming in the mountains and fields; then, the weather warms up, it gets hot, until autumn, harvesting, and it gets cold again, and there are many days. This is the climate of the year. People follow the changes of nature, calmly doing their own work, and this kind of life has been going on day after day for more than ninety years.</p>
<p>But in recent years, everything is obviously different from before. For example, land rent is increased, taxes are increased, bandits often rob, prices are more expensive year by year, and local products are gradually reduced, and finally disappear; everything used is foreign goods; the agricultural products harvested in a year, after being sold, not only cannot save some money as before, but become unusually difficult,………… These, even if people don't know what's going on, or don't think carefully about the reason, there is no doubt that their lives have fallen from stability into an inexplicable hardship. My hometown, although just a secluded village, finally cannot escape this general phenomenon of rural destruction.</p>
<p>However, if it were just like this, they could still live hard by relying on their own labor: but now? Now everything is over, and they can't even live a life of hardship. Poor hometown, now it has been completely destroyed; under the planes and cannons of Japanese imperialism, it has been burned and burned, and all the houses, fields, livestock and property are gone, and now only a devastated ruin remains. Ah丨 Jinjiatun, my dear hometown丨 If one day I can return to your arms, where will I go to find the remains of my old home?</p>
<h3 id="e29">Plunder Marriage among Savage Races <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jianfeng</p>
<p>Plunder marriage has gradually decreased with the progress of human civilization, but this custom is still prevalent among uncivilized savage tribes.</p>
<p>The American Indian tribes still perform this tragicomedy everywhere today. Battles often occur between these tribes: the mounted Indians of Patagonia and the canoe-riding Indian tribes often have battles between individuals and battles between tribes. When they win, they kill the men and kidnap the women. In the tribes of the Amazon and Orinoco, slightly north of these two tribes, except for a portion influenced by Christianity, the rest are still constantly fighting each other, often capturing the women of the other side to use for bearing children. The Indians in the Caribbean region are divided into many small tribes or family groups, with each tribe or group having about forty to fifty people. These tribes often have conflicts due to different languages that they cannot understand. The winning tribe not only carries out large-scale massacres, but also takes the killed people to fill their stomachs丨 However, these killed and eaten people are all men, and the women are usually kept and taken back to be wives. In Australian savage society, this trend of plunder marriage is more harmful than in the above-mentioned regions, and the methods of plunder are also more cruel. Because there are more men than women in Australia, men in various tribes simply rarely get sexual satisfaction. When they need women, the only way is to plunder. They often secretly watch the movements of the woman they love, and when the woman is not wary, they suddenly run over and stun her with a stick, then twist her hair and drag her to the nearby forest. When she regains consciousness, they force her to go to his home together to carry out what they call married life. And the woman's family does not feel resentful about this cruel behavior, because they are the same. When the opportunity comes, they will also commit the same atrocities against other people's women. Readers may be very surprised to see these words, but these are all savage peoples, which is still excusable. If I tell you that even the newest countries like the Soviet Union still have this habit, wouldn't that be even more shocking? Originally, there are some Caucasian people in Russia who still regard this kind of marriage as commonplace. They often snatch women at night and put them on horses. If they are chased, then the horses, weapons, and everything else will be confiscated. If they succeed, then the bride will live with him. This custom of plunder marriage is also popular among the Letts and Uchi people north of Estonia. The most interesting are the Uchi people, who often snatch women when the women's parents are working in the fields or sleeping in the house.</p>
<p>Plunder marriage relies entirely on the man's unilateral will to grab a woman to satisfy his own desires, completely ignoring the woman's love, interests, and even sexual desires. This can be said to be the most savage and cruel form of marriage. In the 20th century, the existence of plunder marriage can be said to be a disgrace to humanity!</p>
<h3 id="e30">A Black Woman's Quest for God (XI) <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Written by George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>[Brains!] the shortsighted one said, as if he could hardly believe his ears. [You must be a very ignorant girl,] he chuckled. [Do you not know that a scientist is all brains from head to foot?]</p>
<p>[Tell that to the fishes,] the black girl said. [Tell me again. Have you ever considered the effect of your experiments on the spirits and characters] of other people? Is it worth while to lose your own soul and corrupt everybody elses for the sake of discovering something about dogs' spittle?]</p>
<p>[You are talking nonsense,] said the shortsighted one. [Can you prove the existence of this organ you call a soul on the operating table or in the dissecting room? Can you reproduce in the laboratory this process you call corruption?] [By tapping with my] [Nobberkeleigh,] the black girl said, [I can change a living soul into a dead body with no soul in it. Then you can see the difference and appreciate it. And when people do wicked things to corrupt their] souls you see the difference then too.]</p>
<p>[I have seen people die; but I have never seen them corrupting their souls,] said the shortsighted one.</p>
<p>[But you have seen them go to the devil, havnt you?] said the black girl. [You are going to the devil yourself, are you not?] [That is an insult; a most extreme personal insult,] said the shortsighted one loftily. [I leave you.]</p>
<p>So he went his way, thinking only of how to make a dog climb a tree to prove scientifically that he could climb a tree himself; and the black girl went her way until she came to a little hill, on the top of which stood a huge cross, guarded by a Roman soldier with a long lance. Now the priest, who had found the same queer joy in crucifying terror that she had found in breaking her own heart and the hearts of her lovers, had, in spite of all her lessons, made the black girl hate the cross, because it was a great pity that Jesus had not lived to a ripe old age of wisdom and died peacefully without suffering, and so could not protect his granddaughters (she imagined that Jesus had at least twenty promising black granddaughters) against the selfishness and tyranny of their parents. Therefore, she turned her head away from the cross with an expression of marked disgust, just as the Roman soldier rushed at her with his lance and roared, [Slave, kneel before the emblem and instrument of Roman justice, Roman law, Roman order, and] Roman peace, et cetera.]</p>
<p>But the black girl avoided the lance and swung her [Nobberkeleigh] with such effect on the back of his neck that he collapsed, unable to put his legs together again. [That is the emblem and instrument of slavey and all that is excellent,] said the black girl, showing him the [Nobberkeleigh. [How do you like it?] [Ugh!] groaned the soldier. [A hero done in by a black female dog! The end of the world has come.] And he stopped struggling, and lay on the ground crying like a child.</p>
<p>He had recovered before she was far away; but he was a Roman soldier and could not leave his post to indulge his feelings. The last she saw of him before the edge of the little hill cut off their view of one another was his fist shaking at her; and the last she heard from him need not be repeated here.</p>
<p>Her next adventure was by a well, where she stopped to drink, and suddenly saw a man sitting beside it, whom she had not noticed before. Just as she was about to scoop up some water with her hand, he produced a cup from somewhere and said,</p>
<p>[Take this and drink, in remembrance of me.]</p>
<p>[Thank you, Sir,] she said, and drank immediately. [Thank you very much.]</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(8) The Hair-Cutting Movement in the Late Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Men wore braids like factory tails, and women bound their small feet to be called golden lotuses. When Europeans and Americans first saw these strange-looking Chinese people, they were all surprised, or even ridiculed and despised them. This is where the idea of cutting braids and unbinding feet in the late Qing Dynasty came from. The hair-cutting movement originated from overseas students and overseas Chinese, and many new scholars in the mainland also followed suit. Overseas students with revolutionary ideas often cut their braids, and overseas Chinese who did not want to return to China also cut their braids. Although the Qing court initially banned it, it eventually had no choice. Zhang Taiyan has a poem written in prison for Zou Rong:</p>
<p>Zou Rong, my younger brother, with disheveled hair, went down to the continent.</p>
<p>Quickly cut off the braids with scissors, dried beef is the throat.</p>
<p>The hero has entered prison, and the world is also sad in autumn.</p>
<p>When life is about to end, we must join hands, the universe is only two ends.</p>
<p>This poem is not included in Zhang's collection, but only appeared in the Zhejiang Chao B number thirty years ago. Zhang's thesis is based on the Wei and Jin Dynasties, despising the Qi and Liang Dynasties and below, so there are no near-style poems in the collection. Now that there is this poem, it is even more precious and unusual. The poem describes his and Zou Rong's spirit, which is most representative of the so-called revolutionary heroes of that time, and the only characteristic of these heroes is that they can use [quick scissors to cut off their braids.] In the second year of Xuantong, Wu Tingfang, the former minister to the United States, submitted a memorial requesting that hair be cut and clothes not be changed, which roughly said: When I was an envoy to the Americas, I met with overseas Chinese and saw that they had cut their braids and changed to Western suits, eight or nine out of ten. Some who have not cut them off, also coil them high on their heads, hidden and closed tightly, fearing that people will know. They all say that drooping braids are often ridiculed by foreigners, and even given various unflattering names, sometimes even teased by women and children. Moreover, it is inconvenient for them to work and they get their clothes dirty, which is even more criticized. Moreover, with machine manufacturing and factories everywhere, there are often reports of people getting into danger because of their braids. He also said: Since the eastward spread of European customs, the residents of the mainland, except for officials and gentry, all students, scholars, men and women, workers, merchants, and farmers, have cut off their long hair for the sake of convenience in their daily lives, everywhere. People belong to the same country and live in the same country, but they wear different clothes and have different systems, as if they were from Chu and Yue. This is truly rare in the world, and it is also something that those who observe the country and collect customs are surprised by. Moreover, as the trend of the times becomes newer and newer, their number will only increase. Even strict laws and severe prohibitions will not be able to stop it. As the saying goes, change or not change, it will change. Why not change it ourselves, and still have something to encourage the spirit of innovation from top to bottom? The memorial was not answered. A year later, there was the Guangzhou March 29th Uprising. Many party members died, but among those buried in Huanghuagang, there were also those who were not party members but had cut off their braids. At that time, the Hong Kong Chinese Clothing Hair-Cutting Association had more than ten thousand members, all of whom were uneasy and considered Guangzhou a place to be feared.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Bridge and Old Man Zhanlu <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>丨Cutting the Iron Bridge丨</p>
<p>The relationship between bridges and old people, everyone knows, there is Huang Shigong who dropped his shoe on the bridge, this kind of familiar old story, of course, there is no need to repeat it. Now, what is mentioned is not a story but a current event, the bridge, not the one above the mound, is an iron bridge, the old man, not Huang Shigong, is the old man Huang Wei: the relationship between the bridge and the old man is not that the old man Huang Shigong dropped his shoe on the bridge, but that the old man Huang Wei cut the rope on the bridge.</p>
<p>The rope-cutting ceremony for a new bridge opening to traffic has the same importance as the bottle-throwing ceremony for a new ship launching: the only difference is that the bottle-throwing ceremony is suitable for women with beautiful faces, while the rope-cutting ceremony is suitable for old men with white hair. Guangzhou recently held a Qiying meeting, with two people over the age of one hundred, a man named Huang Wei, and a woman named Deng Huangshi, who are highly respected by local people. Recently, because of the Haizhu Iron Bridge, which has been under construction for more than two years, a driving ceremony was held on the 15th of this month. A pair of golden scissors was made by the Mackdon Company, which built the bridge, for the purpose of cutting the rope for the bridge opening; the Social Bureau also sent a letter to the oldest Qiying in middle age, Huang Wei, who has many children and grandchildren, to hold the knife to perform the rope-cutting ceremony. Then, Huang Wei and fourteen other old people led the way across the bridge, followed by military and political leaders, while music was played and cannons were fired, announcing the completion of the ceremony. This is truly an unprecedented grand event.</p>
<p>Since the call to overthrow the old and decaying has become louder, [old people and yellowed pearls are worthless,] of course, everyone recognizes them as outdated figures: Guangzhou held a Qiying meeting, and also invited a centenarian to be the pioneer to cross the bridge; the old men and old women were in the limelight, to put it nicely, it is respecting the old and respecting seniority, to put it badly, it is reversing the wheel of the times.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Rubber Band <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>丨Be Careful Not to Snap It丨</p>
<p>In the joint declaration of Zhang Taiyan and Ma Xiangbo, it is said that Japan's rubber band should be retracted from Korea. The three characters [Rubber Band] are used very meaningfully.</p>
<p>Men and women, old and young, all comrades who do not tie up their trouser legs, please lift your trouser legs to your knees, remain silent for three minutes, and think carefully: are the garter belts, each occupying a piece on your two hairy calves, Japanese products? Within these Japanese garter belts, is there a trace of rubber band?</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a rubber band. This kind of rubber band, if it is not woven into cotton fabric, can be stretched to several times its original length.</p>
<p>Japan's original territory is like a narrow and long rubber band. Since it occupied Ryukyu and Taiwan, and swallowed Korea and Liaodong, Japan's rubber band has been stretched very long. After the European War, it took over the German-owned South Pacific Islands, stretching the rubber band several times longer. However, since seizing the Northeast, although the rubber band has been stretched somewhat again, various countries have begun to interfere, and instability has gradually emerged within Japan. This is like a rubber band, although stretched long, has exceeded its ability to withstand the force, and is showing signs of breaking.</p>
<p>Although a rubber band can be stretched long, once it breaks and shrinks into two small segments, it cannot maintain its original length. Therefore, stretching a rubber band, although it seems like a fun trick, is actually a very dangerous thing. A three-inch-long rubber band can only be used for three inches. If you insist on using a three-inch rubber band for three feet, then once it breaks, it cannot even be used for three inches. What is the point of that?</p>
<p>Japan's rubber band has now been stretched to the point of breaking. If it does not let go, once it breaks, everything will be over, and even the original length cannot be maintained, as it will already be divided into two segments.</p>
<p>Zhang and Ma advise Japan to retract the rubber band from Korea, which is indeed the right medicine for the problem. However, one does not give up until reaching the Yellow River; if the rubber band does not break, how can Japan be willing to stop?</p>
<h3 id="e34">Remaining Words on the Liu Case <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The tragic death of Liu Yusheng, the chief writer of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, is a major topic of discussion in the city and known throughout the country. During his lifetime, Liu had a ten-year friendship with Yan Fusun due to their shared literary interests. Last autumn, when Liu was imprisoned, Liu's relatives and friends all ran around to rescue him. Liu's family once consulted the oracle in a gourd, receiving the two characters [口] [合]. Yan immediately deduced, "The character 口 clearly represents a tiger's mouth, taking the character [人] and sending it into the tiger's mouth creates the character [囚] (prisoner). A person placed within this airtight mouth can no longer escape, and the outcome is likely very dangerous. Look at this character [合], it is clearly an incomplete character [命] (life). A life character that is interrupted, is nothing other than a broken life!" Madam Liu, a weak woman, wept bitterly upon hearing this interpretation. Several months later, unexpectedly, Liu's fate tragically corresponded to the oracle in the gourd. Alas! Fate is predetermined, what more can be said?</p>
<h3 id="e35">Saving the Nation with a Magic Weapon <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>丨[Ten Thousand Divinely Blessed Yellow Bags]丨</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Gangyi, because he hated foreign devils, prepared to fight them, so he trained some soldiers called [Tiger Spirit Battalion]: taking the meaning that [Tigers] can eat [Sheep] and [Spirits] can subdue [Ghosts]. Furthermore, by reciting incantations, bullets could not penetrate the flesh. By casting spells, [foreign devils] would be killed by flying sand and stones. As a result, although the incantations were useless, they did indeed subdue many [ghosts], causing a disturbance. At the time, the higher-class Chinese people were not saddened by the failure, but rather blamed them for being too foolish, and not being respectable in their interactions with the [scientific] foreign adults, so they called them [Boxer Rebellion]. [Boxer] means bare hands: concealing those broadswords, spears, incantations, shields, and other [national treasures] [divine weapons]. [Rebellion] was an excuse for the government to absolve itself of responsibility. Moreover, it could be used to [suppress bandits], and [suppressing bandits] could be used to appease foreigners. Since it was both [Boxer] and [Rebellion], it was naturally appropriate to add [Disturbance]. However, [times change], Mr. Sun Yat-sen praised them as a manifestation of national revolutionary consciousness. The wronged souls in hell finally had a chance to ascend. However, the subtle distinctions in terminology truly make people believe in the iron rule that [if the name is not correct, then the words will not be proper]. For example, looking at today's newspaper, there is another piece of news similar to the above. The original text is as follows: (20th, Beiping Telegram) The Most Venerable Quanhe donates and manufactures ten thousand divinely blessed yellow bags to be gifted to the frontline armies.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese devils have already invaded Rehe, and the whole country is united against the enemy. Monks are also citizens of China, and their patriotic hearts should not lag behind. However, the [aviation to save the nation] advocated by various sectors is inconsistent with [unscientific] teachings. Therefore, there is the [saving the nation with a magic weapon] of [divinely blessed yellow bags]. The [Spirit] in [Divinely Blessed Yellow Bags] and the [Spirit] in [Tiger Spirit Battalion] both take the meaning of subduing ghosts. The three characters [Tiger Spirit Battalion] only imply attack and not defense, a lesson learned from the overturned cart in front. Therefore, [Blessing] is used. By both subduing ghosts and blessing oneself, one can be said to know oneself and one's enemy, and thus be able to win every battle.</p>
<p>And saving the nation can also spread the teaching at the same time; this is secondary. Therefore, recalling the anti-Japanese war in Songhu last spring, female students from various places all donated military uniforms, clothing, trousers, and the like, and some even personally embroidered characters such as [Wishing you victory] [True Man], greatly boosting the morale of the army. But compared to [divinely blessed yellow bags], it is far behind!</p>

<p>— Yu Sijin</p>
<p>丨One of the Things I Write When I Think of Them丨</p>
<p>Money, it is money that makes people live, and it is also money that makes people die.</p>
<p>Capitalists rack their brains to exploit the poor for money, and the proletariat desperately resists, isn't that also for money? Cities are created by money, and at the same time, the vagrants in cities are also created by money. Destroying the countryside is even more the magic of money.</p>
<p>The soul of the saver is entrusted to money. The soul of the moneyless is also spinning around in money.</p>
<p>Wanting to become an official is wanting money; originally, wanting to do any career, simply put, is wanting money.</p>
<p>Money is easily exchanged for guns, but guns are exchanged for money by luck.</p>
<p>People say that people should not be manipulated by money, but how many are not manipulated by money?</p>
<p>As the times evolve and material civilization advances, money becomes more useful, and its magic becomes greater.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten old women go to temples to offer incense for money. Whether one's status in society is high or low fundamentally depends on money.</p>
<p>With money, one can go to university and study abroad, buy doctoral and bachelor's degrees, eat big meals and ride in cars in the city; without money, one stays at home, illiterate, the agricultural and forestry economy goes bankrupt, and one comes to the city to wander.</p>
<p>Only money is worthy of the title of [omnipotent doctor]. The saying is indeed true: with money by your side, you walk in the middle of the road; without money by your side, you walk like a plague insect.</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Landowner <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>倭子, 倭子 means 倭寇 (Japanese pirates). Because Chongming is an island, and the defending troops are particularly weak, therefore, in the few years before the imminent downfall of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates began to sail across the sea in small boats, relying on their sharp Japanese swords, to rob and plunder in groups: since the officials could not protect the people, the people had no choice but to rise up and resist automatically. The landowner was one of the most ardent advocates of resistance. In the past five years, he had already commanded his sons and the villagers of one village to defeat the Japanese pirates twice.</p>
<p>[Good! Old man! Remember this! In three years we will come back for revenge, and we will kill your entire village, leaving not a single dog or chicken, to vent our anger!] When the Japanese pirates were defeated for the second time, and the landowner led the masses to chase them all the way to the seaside, one of the Japanese pirates, who had already boarded the boat, pointed his Japanese sword at the landowner, gnashing his teeth, and making this vow.</p>
<p>Past events proved that what this Japanese pirate said was not a facetious threat, because the Japanese pirates are the most vicious and most bestial beings, and they list killing as part of their family education, especially being brave in revenge. The landowner also believed that his words would be realized one day, so after that pacification, his heart was extremely uneasy: however, he was not afraid, nor did he want to abandon his home and flee, he only worked hard to train his sons and villagers, preparing for a great slaughter every day.</p>
<p>Therefore, Little Ling's father used fighting the Japanese pirates to inspire his son; Little Ling listened, and also worked especially hard, wishing he could immediately grow hundreds of pounds of strength, so that he could stab holes in the chests of the Japanese pirates with his spear.</p>
<p>The setting sun gradually dimmed, but the people practicing martial arts on the field were not decreasing; the landowner raised his white head, looked at the newly rising crescent moon, and let out a smug smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of noisy human voices arose outside the forest, interspersed with the crying of women and children.</p>
<p>[Landowner! Disaster has struck!] Immediately, a strong young man, protected by six fierce dogs, ran in as if flying. [This time is not like before! Landowner!]</p>
<p>What should be done!</p>
<p>The people practicing martial arts stopped their activities and gathered around the landowner and the messenger. [What disaster? Explain clearly!] the landowner urged.</p>
<p>[Japanese pirates! Japanese pirates! Japanese pirates everywhere! I really don't know how many have come,] the messenger shouted as if he were crazy. (3)</p>

<h3 id="e38">Chicken <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The sexagenary cycle for this year is Guiyou, and You belongs to the chicken. I will talk about chickens.</p>
<p>What did chickens evolve from? According to research, the ancestors of chickens originally lived in the wilderness, living the same lives as wild chickens. Later, they were captured by humans and raised at home, gradually shedding their wild nature. If we observe them in the wilderness of present-day India, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, and so on, we can determine that the ancestors of chickens were indeed wild chickens.</p>
<p>Before clocks were invented, people relied entirely on the crowing of chickens to calculate the time, the so-called first watch chicken, second watch chicken... fifth watch chicken, which we often see in myths and novels. However, the species of chickens can be divided into more than five hundred types according to the size of their bodies and the color of their plumage. Among them, the most precious is the long-tailed chicken, whose tail feathers can be as long as seven meters. As for the most prolific egg-laying chicken, it is a short-tailed, white-colored Xiumo species. The incubation period for hens is approximately three weeks. Nowadays, artificial incubation (electric temperature incubator) is mostly used in various countries, and each time it can incubate 10,000 to 20,000 eggs, so the breeding of chickens has increased more and more in recent years.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, today I will write down two ingenious ways of calculating numbers for everyone to see, and other methods can be deduced similarly. For example, starting from one times nine plus two below, it becomes a very interesting equation.</p>

<p>For example, nine times ten is ninety, times eleven is ninety-nine, times twelve is one hundred and eight, but it is very difficult to multiply and get exactly one hundred. Now if you multiply four nines together, that is 99, which is exactly one hundred.</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers call the British Concession permits [Big British Permits], and the Chinese territory permits [Small Permits]; people generally call Western food [Big Dishes], and Chinese food [Small Dishes]. Why are they so humble?</p>
<p>Foreign soldiers strut down the side of the road, and if a Chinese person walking more slowly blocks their path, they reach out and push them aside, then proudly walk past without even turning their heads. Ha! Foreign-capital companies and foreign firms stand in rows. Foreign managers lean back on sofas and smoke cigars with an air of superiority, while Chinese puppets run around all day long, busy scraping the fat off their compatriots.</p>

<p>The Financial Gold Tide Runs Torrentially</p>
<p>Foreign Silver Rises Sharply, Opening Plunges Violently by Ten Taels</p>
<p>The Exchange Market Desperately Covers Shorts, Rises Abruptly by Four Taels</p>
<p>The gold market has been changing extremely rapidly recently. Yesterday morning, overseas telegrams indicated that both near and far positions in London silver were afraid of 31.25, and although American silver only rose by 0.25, its transaction price rose sharply by 0.01. The forward silver price rose sharply by more than 0.09, and bank private telegrams rose again by 0.9375, so the gross price of gold market items once reached 567 taels. Later, because the opening of the exchange market did not appear particularly loose, and those covering shorts at low prices, such as Bingxing, etc., all came to purchase gold bars, the opening in the morning was 760 taels. After opening, it rose immediately. The exchange market was also very tight, the banks had a good appetite, and it had risen by more than five taels before seeing a retreat. HSBC's license rate first rose by 0.125, and the American exchange rate rose by 0.25, which was also revealed after this.

In fact, the morale was extremely good, there were many settlements in the exchange market, and large households flocked to purchase gold bars. Although there was news that the UK wanted to collect cash, it was not taken seriously in the market. June American gold, McGary, had once eaten 29.5 yuan, and then 4.375, which was also difficult to settle, so it stopped at 70 taels.

It was found that although the morning opening fell sharply by more than ten taels in one day, it was still able to pull up to the original price later, and as a result it was able to rise slightly.

<p>Banks Are Engaging in Both Inflow and Outflow</p>
<p>Trading Firms Are Also Settling Accounts</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's long-term and short-term rates both rose to 3125, the British pound rose against the U.S. dollar by 75, while the U.S. dollar fell against the British pound by 8125.

Recent quotes showed the British pound at 1 shilling 8.5625 pence and the U.S. dollar at 9.25 yuan, firmer by 1875 and 3125 compared to the previous close. After opening, the market tightened slightly, but banks continued to offer. HSBC quoted the British pound up by 125 and the U.S. dollar up by 25, but this did not seem to have any significant impact, as the exchange market fluctuates frequently. Later, the market gradually became more favorable as banks began to buy in. After several struggles, the June U.S. dollar at 9.4375 yuan remained difficult to settle. The market was stable at the opening in the afternoon due to reports of selling by Guangdong banks. Later, the market saw a sharp tightening, with the June rate reaching 9.25 yuan, but this was mainly due to banks offering top-tier rates. Afterwards, the market gradually stabilized. At the close, recent quotes showed the British pound at 1 shilling 8.3125 pence and the U.S. dollar at 8.875 yuan. The British pound fluctuated by 25 throughout the day, and the U.S. dollar fluctuated by 1275.

<p>The London Silver Price Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from London on the 24th: The market was calm. The closing price for recent deliveries was 17 and 3125 pence, and for forward deliveries 17 and 375 pence, both unchanged from the previous day. The British-American exchange rate opened at $3.40 and 4 and 3/4 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Exchange Rate of Foreign Currency Remained Unchanged, and the Silver Discount Rate Improved Slightly. <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The market has been quiet. The situation in the market in recent days, apart from the mutual buying of foreign currency and discounting of bills among the money shops, transactions with banks have been relatively quiet in recent days. Currently, the silver and foreign currency reserves are more than usual, and the needs of all parties are stagnant. Cash is concentrated and unproductive, which makes the financial turnover inflexible, and the situation is not significantly challenging.</p>
<p>The foreign currency exchange rate fluctuated. The exchange rate for foreign currency in the morning and afternoon was the same due to the lack of demand. Banks had no buying interest, and the market was sluggish. Therefore, the price was the same, with no competition, at 7 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li, which was the same as the previous afternoon's price. The silver discount rate was the same in the morning and afternoon, at 4 fen, which was seemingly higher than the previous day by 2 fen. The transfer fee was also 3 to 4 fen. The silver market is currently sufficiently flush, and there is probably no significant change in recent days.</p>
<p>The auxiliary currency was mixed. The morning and afternoon prices for Jiangsu foreign currency were both 6 mace and 1 fen, an improvement of 7 li compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 7,000 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of Guangdong small foreign currency was 5 mace, 8 fen, and 7.5 li in the morning and 5 mace and 8.7 li in the afternoon, a slight decrease of 1.25 li compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 95,000 jiao in the morning and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of copper coins remained unchanged at 419,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: The handling of silver by banks was moderately busy. Chinese merchants collected over 2.5 million in bills, foreign merchants collected over 1.45 million in bills, telegraphic transfers amounted to over 800,000, special collections amounted to over 3 million, collateral transactions amounted to over 1 million, and various taxes and miscellaneous collections amounted to over 7 million. 800,000 was deposited in warehouses, and money shops collected over 4.7 million. Transfer fee collections amounted to over 3.6 million, and remittances from various sources amounted to over 600,000. Out of the cash collections, 600,000 was released. For foreign currency, the morning trading volume for drafts and bills was 1.11 million, and the afternoon trading volume was 475,000. The morning trading volume for banknotes was 20,000, and the afternoon trading volume was 10,000. The off-market trading volume for banknotes was 30,000 in the morning, with no transactions in the afternoon. The morning trading volume for checks was 25,000, and the afternoon trading volume was 35,000. Interbank trading was 750,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Over 1.2 million was collected and released in foreign currency accounts of various banks. Banknotes recovered and issued amounted to 1.45 million. Money shops collected over 4.7 million. Foreign transfer fee collections amounted to over 1.7 million. Foreign currency borrowing and lending amounted to over 1.4 million. Foreign currency collateral transactions amounted to over 800,000, with 200,000 in inflow and 150,000 in outflow. Small money shops traded over 400,000.</p>
<p>Securities: Public Bonds Rebounded Slightly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Northern Banks and Financial Institutions Bought In</p>
<p>Short Sellers Protected Themselves and Covered Heavily</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, trading in February futures for public bonds had already ceased, and settlement was scheduled for the 27th. Therefore, only March futures were traded yesterday, and the market was relatively quiet. The long and short sides were relatively stable. The market opened with a slight decline, but various issues, such as No. 38 and No. 47, still saw buying interest, so the decline eased slightly. "Bian Yi" bonds fell by 6 jiao, and the market became more stable later. "Tong Yan" bonds only fell by about 1 jiao, so retail investors bought in slightly in the second session, and the market price gradually recovered by 2-3 jiao to over 4 jiao. Because there were no significant changes in the war and diplomatic situation, there were relatively more short positions in the market. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was a sudden rumor that American silver loans were about to be established. Banks from the North and No. 16 and 17 all bought in, and the market price soared from 2 jiao to 8 jiao 5 fen, and the situation became more and more intense, with signs of a rebound. At the close, although there was selling pressure on No. 1 and No. 11 bonds, the buying interest from the North and No. 34, No. 38, and No. 47 bonds remained strong, and the market price rose by another 3-4 jiao to 6-7 jiao. However, because there was more selling pressure on the 20th-year bonds, the 20th Customs and Consolidated Tax bonds only fell by 5 fen, and the Salt Tax bonds also only rose by 5 fen. Looking at the trend of the whole day, it was generally due to the crowding of short positions. Financial institutions also bought in slightly. As there were no good signs in the war and diplomatic situation, the market squeeze had risen for three consecutive days, and a future reaction should be guarded against. Yesterday's market prices continued to rise by 2 jiao 5 fen to over 1 yuan, among which the 19th Goodness bonds rose the most, at 1 yuan 5 fen, and the 19th Customs bonds rose by 1 yuan. The rest all rose by 7-8 jiao, but the "Bian Yi" bonds only rose by 2 jiao 5 fen, the 18th Customs bonds still fell by 2 jiao, and the "Zheng Liu" bonds also fell by 3 jiao. The total trading volume was 4,338,000 yuan. The spot market only had 3,000 yuan. Among the futures, the Salt Tax bonds had the highest volume, but it was still less than 1 million. The Demobilization and Consolidated Tax bonds each accounted for about 600,000, and the rest were all less than 500,000. "Zheng Liu" public bonds had 65,000, and the 18th Customs bonds had 15,000. The trading volume was higher in the afternoon.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Experienced a Sharp Decline</p>
<p>Report from Sin Feng Foreign Firm: On Thursday (the 23rd), the New York stock market experienced a significant decline due to the sharp fall in government bonds and New York bank stocks. The former may have been due to the brewing of the silver currency issue, while the latter was due to the Senate's investigation of the securities companies of major banks. AT&amp;T fell by about 3 dollars due to the reduction in dividends of several companies with close ties. General utility stocks were weak due to the brewing of a reduction in gas and electricity prices. Most of the banks in Michigan have reopened, but operations are limited. United Security Bank only opened its trust department. According to a report in the Steel Age magazine, steel production this week was 19%, down 1% from last week, mainly due to reduced demand from the automotive industry. Broker loans released this week totaled 434,000,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000,000 yuan from last week. The interest rate for bank loans with terms of 60 and 90 days was 0.5%. The trading volume today was 1,330,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　51.94　Down 2.05</p>

<h3 id="e45">Yarn and Cotton Market Slightly Brisk Before Settlement <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>丨Money Shops Recouped Profits from Arbitrage in the Current Month丨</p>
<p>The yarn market was slightly firm as real demand gradually emerged, leading to 1,100 to 1,200 bales being traded for two consecutive days, which stabilized market sentiment. The market was calm, and the money shops recouped some profits from arbitrage in the current month, which further tightened the situation. Distant months were also affected, but some people still sold short due to the intense fighting in Rehe. The future trend depends on the digestion of existing yarn inventory.</p>
<p>Large Bidders Covered Ahead of Settlement. Although American cotton prices fell at the opening, the market sentiment remained tight, as actual sales were still good, there were not many new sellers, and large bidders covered their positions. Prices for all months rose by 7-8 qian. The market situation was more stable in the afternoon, as the current month was the last day, and some people were taking delivery. The last session closed at 138.6 taels, which was 4.5 taels lower than the January price. Distant months fell by 2-6 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 42,800 bales. Yichang sold 3,650 bales, Yiyu sold 1,050 bales, Jifeng sold 1,000 bales, Duanda sold 2,250 bales, Taichang sold 1,150 bales, and Xiesheng sold 900 bales, Mingde 750 bales.

<p>The cotton market was tighter. American cotton prices were weak, while Indian cotton prices trended higher. As a result, market sentiment stabilized, and some people believed that the serious war in North China would cause insurance companies to increase insurance premiums for imported foreign cotton. Therefore, buyers took advantage of this opportunity, and the market became more bullish. The Ningbo firm bought heavily in the afternoon. A certain manufacturer also sold short in distant months. Although spot cotton trading was continuous, Indian cotton was sometimes traded openly.</p>

<p>Grain: The Situation for River Rice Settled</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The supply yesterday was only one boat, and the shipping dispute was unresolved, so there were still no rice boats arriving in Shanghai. Shops in the city and countryside were sluggish, and although demand from contracted buyers was active, it was very limited. Therefore, the market did not see prices rise due to the obstruction of supply. Prices for Qingjiao and Nangang rice from Suzhou and Tongbang remained unchanged, and only Changbang rice was slightly higher by a few jiao. Duyangjian rice remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few boats arriving from the river. Sales of white japonica rice were slightly active in the market, but there were few transactions from the countryside. The market was expected to rise by one jiao for high-quality rice and five to six fen for medium-quality rice. The price of thin japonica rice was stable. Early rice was scarce and selling well, and the price increased by one chi. The supply of yangjian rice was limited, and retail transactions were flat. The prices of zhengdu kejian and baiyuan rice remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice's Appetite is Strong</p>
<p>7,000 Bags of Newly Arrived Jiangxi Rice</p>
<p>The Market is Stable, and Fujian Sales Continue to be Active</p>
<p>The situation of Ke Xian rice yesterday: Over 7,000 bags newly arrived, shipped by Ning Shao, Xin Ning, and Xin Jiang. Among them, Jiangxi machine-milled rice accounted for eight-tenths, and Hunan rice only accounted for two-tenths. This shipment has not yet been unloaded and no samples have been released. It is said that some of it has been directly allocated to customers. Therefore, although a large batch of new arrivals has arrived, there is no significant impact on the market. Fujian sales continued to be active. Yesterday, the local street's appetite was even stronger. In addition to Jiangxi and Hunan rice and Nanshi's Ke Xian rice, 500 bags of small-rolled rice were also purchased. Recently, due to the unresolved dispute over huzi for river rice, the supply of river goods from various places has been withheld by some boatmen. This matter is difficult to resolve in the short term, so the arrival of new sources may also be obstructed. Therefore, the local street intends to continue to purchase Ke Xian rice. With the increased appetite yesterday, sentiment has been upward, but the arrival of new Jiangxi rice has kept the market level. Yesterday, the city opened 700 bags of Jiangxi late machine-milled rice, 285 bags of early machine-milled rice, 300 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice, 1,300 bags of machine-milled red rice, 200 bags of red brown rice, 150 bags of Nanjing chexian rice, and 500 bags of small-rolled rice. Among them, the Fujian group purchased 400 bags of red brown rice and machine-milled red rice, and the rest were purchased by the local street. Details of the prices are listed in the price section.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat are Consistently Downstream</p>
<p>The flour market was consistently dismal in the morning. Foreign wheat quotes fell by one to two jiao. The opening gold price was rumored to have fallen by about ten taels. Therefore,</p>
<p>, but the overall trend was weak and could not be resisted. Therefore, subsequent sessions saw a gradual softening. At the close, near-term contracts were down by 7.5 li, and distant-term contracts were down by 1.25 li or 1.75 li. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still sluggish, but later, because various factories were watching and waiting, the full price was also rumored to have rebounded. The Tianjin group for March deliveries also slightly bought in, and sentiment seemed to be slightly stable. As for the situation of foreign wheat, it remained loose, but various foreign firms were mainly observing due to the Far East issue and were unwilling to do more business. Therefore, the subsequent situation is greatly related to the war. As a result, the current month fell by 1.25 li compared to the previous day, March fell by 7.5 li, April remained unchanged, May fell by 2.5 li, June fell by 5 li, and July fell by 5 li.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for various months generally turned flat and weak. Foreign wheat quotes fell by one to two jiao. In addition, imports of foreign wheat have been very smooth recently, and factories have them. The current month was the last day, and there were very few takers, so the market was squeezed small again, down to 3 taels 2 qian 2 fen. As for the actual delivery, it was heard that there were only a few cars, because both buyers and sellers voluntarily canceled the contracts. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was no market for the current month. For March and April, the sentiment was very chaotic due to the squeeze on the current month. March was down to 3 taels 2 qian 5 fen, and April was down to 2 qian 7 fen, both down by 2-3 fen. July was also down by 3 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Japanese Troops Skirt Around and Invade Lingnan <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battles on All Fronts of Rehe Province Amidst Heavy Snow</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Primary Targets Are to Seize Chifeng and Lingyuan</p>
<p>The Cui Brigade Repels Large Groups of Mongolian Bandits on the Kailu Front</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Continue to Bomb Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Other Locations</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed from the 24th, reporting to Beiping that battles had broken out on the Lingyuan border. Lingnan and Kailu were extremely tense. The Japanese army was preparing to attack Chifeng from Kailu in the north and Lingyuan from Lingnan in the south. Currently, the Japanese army is using motor vehicles to transport troops along the road. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sixty armored vehicles filled with Japanese soldiers departed from Jinzhou yesterday morning and advanced towards Lingnan last night. This morning, artillery fire was heard from Ling, initiating provocations. We are fully prepared and vow to strike fiercely. (25th Dispatch) (Beiping) With the Japanese army already commencing its attack on Kailu, the events in Rehe have taken a definitively formal shape in Tokyo. Their advance towards Kailu suggests their aim is Chifeng, located one hundred li northwest of Chengde. As for their advance towards the Chaoyang area, it appears their target is Lingyuan, less than one day's journey northwest of Shanhaiguan. Chifeng and Lingyuan are two essential passes for entering the central part of the province. If the Chinese army wishes to mount an effective resistance, it must spare no sacrifice in defending these two mountain passes. The defense of Lingyuan is especially solid. According to foreign military experts, the Chinese army there is determined and should be able to resist the Japanese army for at least several weeks, or even indefinitely. The Japanese army's advance on Kailu is progressing rapidly. However, volunteer troops guard the area between Tongliao and Kailu, so they must first fight the volunteer troops before encountering genuine resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese army's actions in attacking Chaoyang are currently not considered noteworthy, so the Japanese army is now attempting a large-scale encirclement to the south to pressure Lingyuan. However, according to official reports, the Japanese army's attempts have made little progress. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A report received from Tang Yulin today states that the Japanese army and [Manchu] troops are actively attacking Rehe, but to date, the Japanese army has not yet engaged with formal Chinese troops, having only encountered volunteer troops. These hardy volunteer troops, in the icy, snowy northern terrain, will inflict heavy blows on the Japanese army. The Japanese army encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army when approaching Chaoyang Temple. Due to the solidity of the Chinese army's lines, the Japanese army's frontal assault has failed. Currently, Japanese troops are attempting to encircle to the south, with Lingyuan as their target. Japanese reinforcements are moving from Suizhong towards Rehe, also clearly aiming for Lingyuan. Operations are also underway near Kailu. The total number of Japanese troops is estimated to be at least 60,000, in addition to some [Manchu] troops participating in the operations. The Japanese air force is currently finding it difficult to operate due to adverse weather conditions, making reconnaissance and bombing difficult. Previous reports from Tokyo of mutinies by Chinese troops in Rehe have been strongly denied here. According to a European military expert recently returned from Rehe, the Chinese army's defense is extremely sound. If they can hold, the Japanese army will need to increase its forces to more than twice their current total to succeed in their attack. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to official reports, Japanese planes again carried out heavy bombing raids over Chaoyang, killing many civilians and destroying countless homes. Japanese planes are also conducting daily reconnaissance over the Chifeng area, but are afraid to fly low due to intense anti-aircraft fire. Official reports also state that after the Japanese army's frontal assault on Chaoyang failed, they have retreated and are reorganizing at Chaoyang Temple. Another column that has moved out from Suizhong is advancing towards Lingnan, aiming to threaten the rear of the Chinese army at Chaoyang. However, the Lingnan area is a continuous range of mountains, and the Japanese army's advance must pass through narrow mountain valleys. Machine guns are densely placed on the high ground of the four mountains, and the enemy army will be unable to overcome this great danger. According to news from Linyu, 4,000 [Manchu] soldiers have arrived from Suizhong to support the Japanese army. Reports of the fall of Kailu have not been verified. Official reports were still being sent from there last night, stating that Manchu and Mongolian troops had repeatedly attacked but were repelled. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kailu, 7:00 PM on the 24th: Heavy snow has fallen for days, and the temperature is two degrees below zero. However, the fighting between the two sides is extremely fierce today. This morning, a large number of Mongolian bandit cavalry, under the cover of Japanese artillery fire, set out from the Bilin Temple and launched three fierce attacks on our positions. Our Cui Brigade calmly responded, inflicting heavy casualties on the Mongolian cavalry, which ultimately failed to achieve their goal. In the afternoon, a large force of Japanese and traitorous allied troops attacked again, engaging in a stalemate in the Zhaoge Temple area for three hours before retreating without success. In this battle, our Cui Brigade captured three aircraft and more than a hundred Mongolian bandits, as well as numerous horses. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Dong Brigade Repels Enemy Troops at Beipiao</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Beiping this afternoon, reporting that he received a telegram from Brigade Commander Dong on the morning of the 24th, stating that more than 3,000 Japanese troops, using armored vehicles as cover, attacked the Nanling Road positions. The Dong Regiment of our army ambushed within the trenches of Nanling to meet the enemy. The Japanese army launched several assaults, engaging in close combat with bayonets. Our army used hand grenades to bomb the enemy, whose corpses littered the ground. At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, the combat troops launched a full-scale counterattack from their defensive positions towards Beipiao. Reinforcements also arrived at the time, and the traitorous troops were ultimately defeated. The enemy and our side suffered heavy losses. The enemy at Koubeiyingzi are currently being pursued. Japanese planes have been flying to Chaoyang Sanbaoyingzi and our positions for days, carrying out bombing raids, etc. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly to Lingyuan and Drop Bombs</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lingyuan states that Japanese planes have been flying to conduct reconnaissance and drop bombs for days. On the 22nd, two planes reconnoitered and dropped two bombs in the Shantou area. On the 23rd, four planes flew in formation over Lingyuan, dropping more than ten bombs. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingyuan, 24th: Japanese planes have been flying in for days to drop heavy bombs, causing many innocent civilians to be injured. Civilian houses inside and outside the city have been severely damaged. However, our defensive positions have natural cover and cannot be destroyed by air power. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Enemy Headquarters is Established in Suizhong County</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy's headquarters for the attack on Chaoyang is located outside the South Gate of Suizhong County. A large number of aircraft and three trainloads of 38-type rifle bullets and mortars arrived in Suizhong from Jinzhou last night. Cheng Guorui was in Suizhong once last night. More than a thousand Mongolian bandits newly recruited in Suizhong have been formed into a puppet army (regiment) by the traitor Cheng (and will be sent to the front). (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linyu, 7:00 PM on the 24th: Ammunition and supplies have been arriving in Suizhong for days, piling up like mountains, and more than 4,000 puppet troops have arrived. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Bao Wenwei has come to Nanjing with a mandate from Zhang Xueliang to discuss important matters.

Our army is currently firmly defending Chaoyang. A unofficial telegram from North China was just received, stating that our army is still counterattacking in Beipiao, and also firmly defending its positions, annihilating many enemies. It is widely rumored in the Beiping-Tianjin area that the Japanese army is determined to launch a general offensive against us on March 1st. Our side is already making preparations separately. Combining the Japanese troops attacking Rehe and those concentrated in the Shanhaiguan area, there are six divisions in total. Although the enemy and we have already made contact, the main battle has not yet begun. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Continues to Handle the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>The United States and Russia are Expected to Participate in Cooperation</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the continued meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly tonight, Chairman Hymans proposed a resolution and then invited Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun to speak, but asked him not to touch upon the remarks made by Japanese representative Matsuoka this morning. Therefore, Gu's speech was limited to the situation in Rehe, explaining the danger of the situation in Rehe and asking the General Assembly to authorize the committee to take necessary steps before adjournment so that the effective actions of member states and non-member states can be realized as soon as possible. Dr. Gu stated that the Chinese representatives are prepared to assist the committee's work in any possible way. The recent document sent by the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations has proven that Japan has absolutely no reason to indulge its ambitions in Rehe. Tang Yulin has never declared Rehe independent. Japan has raised doubts about China's sovereignty over its own territory, which directly denies the right of national existence and destroys the basic principles of international law. This document from Japan contains a warning. What right does Japan have to demand that China withdraw its troops guarding its territory? The so-called [Manchukuo] is not only a puppet, but also a mask for Japan's militarism. Judging from the conclusions of the Lytton Commission's investigation team and the League of Nations General Assembly report, the so-called Japan-[Manchu] agreement is actually a confession of guilt by Japan itself. We must devote all our efforts to resist aggression. The Japanese spokesperson claimed that it was unnecessary. Japan's claim that it does not want to attack Beiping and Tianjin is a way for Japan to announce the second object it wants to obtain. Yesterday's Japanese note was simply a declaration of war. Please also pay attention to the system of joint sanctions against aggressor countries when they are incorrigible, as recorded in the Covenant. Is there any doubt about Japan's illegal war of aggression? In this critical situation, only by taking swift action in accordance with the Covenant and implementing sanctions can the world know that the League of Nations values the League of Nations' justice and earnestly carries out its highest mission. What is this mission? It is international peace! After Gu completed his speech, Chairman Hymans asked if anyone else wished to speak. No one responded. The chairman then announced the end of the discussion. The chairman also said that if no one objected to the draft resolution he had proposed, it would be considered passed. There were no objections, and the resolution was declared passed. The General Assembly then adjourned. (24th Reuters Dispatch) (Geneva) It is still uncertain whether the Japanese delegation's posture in the meeting today was merely a demonstration or a prelude to genuinely severing relations with the League of Nations. Many feel that Japanese representative Matsuoka's second speech, in which he said that Japan has now reached the limit of its willingness to cooperate with the League of Nations regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, was ambiguous in its meaning. However, it is expected that the Japanese government will soon reveal its position. There may not be immediate developments in Geneva, but it is only temporary. The newly formed 21-member committee will meet tomorrow to issue invitations to the United States and Russia. The United States is expected to accept, and Russia may also join. If so, the committee will not waste much time waiting for the representatives of the two countries to arrive. Mediation procedures have now been exhausted, so the League of Nations has no room for activity for the time being. However, once the US representative joins, the committee will be greatly encouraged, and the development of the situation in Rehe may also give the League of Nations reason to take a stronger stance. Chinese representative Dr. Gu mentioned the sanctions that the League of Nations could adopt in his speech this afternoon, so it is expected that China will request the application of Article 16 of the Covenant due to the invasion of Rehe. It is said that even if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it must fulfill all its international obligations under Article 1 of the Covenant. In other words, Japan will still be subject to various sanctions within the League of Nations' jurisdiction. It is generally hoped that Japan will not withdraw from the Disarmament Conference, otherwise international efforts to ensure peace through disarmament will suffer a fatal blow. Now that Germany and Italy have expressed their unyielding nature, and Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, and the war clouds in the Far East are becoming more and more diffused, the hope for a real achievement of the Disarmament Conference is almost non-existent. According to general opinion, the future of naval disarmament is not very optimistic. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva Dispatch) Before the League of Nations General Assembly met today, Japanese chief representative Matsuoka, while talking with guests, alluded to a story in the New Testament. With a sincere tone, Matsuoka resembled a Christian preacher, saying that the Far East dispute was like Jesus and a sinful woman. At that time, Jesus said, "Let he who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone [to kill her]." Japan's position today is very similar to that of the woman. The great powers should ask themselves which country is without sin. Do they have the qualifications to throw stones? (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Japanese Newspaper Discusses the Reasons for the League of Nations' Anti-Japanese Stance <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun published an article stating that since the Sino-Japanese issue arose, various countries have shown great jealousy towards Japan. The reason for this is not entirely due to the Sino-Japanese issue, but because the countries' own positions and interests have led to this. The underlying motives of various countries in deliberating the Sino-Japanese issue are analyzed below: (1) South American countries have no direct interest in the Far East and hope that the alliance will establish the authority to adjudicate belligerent countries, forcing them to accept the alliance's resolutions. This is something that South American countries must do for political reasons. (2) Ireland is a free state and has no relationship with either China or Japan. However, due to its anti-British hostility, the anti-Japanese actions of its representative, Mr. Lester, were very intense. (3) Representatives from small countries, such as Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Beneš, Swiss President Motta, Spanish Ambassador Madariaga, and Swedish representative Undén, want to promote the true power of the alliance in international politics and prevent attacks by neighboring great powers in the future. In other words, small countries are deeply afraid that problems similar to the Sino-Japanese one will occur again in Europe, so they are doing everything they can to promote the establishment of a precedent for fair action by the alliance. (4) France initially held a pro-Japanese attitude, but its sudden change of policy was due to two reasons: first, Germany was controlled by the Hitler faction; second, it was stimulated by the surrounding situation; and third, the international relations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles should be firmly adhered to. If the alliance's regulations are not strengthened, it will suffer losses in the future. (5) Poland also has no great interest in the Far East and has no choice but to agree with the opinions of all parties. (6) Russia has always paid attention to Japan's Manchurian policy because the interests are very large. (7) Germany is currently in a chaotic domestic situation and does not want to take sides. (8) The United States believes that after Japan withdraws from the alliance, the United States can become closer to the alliance, and there is also news that the United States wants to join the alliance in 1935. Due to the above relationships, the anti-Japanese stance of various countries is actually within expectations.</p>

<p>Selecting Soldiers with the Strongest Cold Resistance</p>
<p>Prohibition on Speaking to Anyone Before Departure</p>
<p>A dispatch from the China United Press in Tokyo reports that although Minister of War Araki repeatedly states, "There is no need to increase troops in Manchuria," such statements are merely intended to conceal the actual evidence of his aggressive militarism. Since the opening of the Diet, in order to intensify the invasion of Jehol, troops have been continuously transported to the three northeastern provinces. In particular, newly enlisted soldiers are being secretly transported in large numbers, under the pretext of practical field training, to carry out aggressive deployment arrangements. The number of troop transports in January is listed below:</p>
<p>[January 17th] The Yamagata Garrison was ordered to begin organizing the formation of troops to be transported to Manchuria. As of recently, there are more than 3,000 people under the command of Major Aihara. [January 25th] The Kamiki unit and the Hirono Field Artillery unit, each with more than 300 people, departed twice from Hirosaki Station. [January 26th] The Hirono Field Artillery unit, the Miyake Garrison unit, and the Hayakawa Infantry unit also departed from Hirosaki Station in large numbers. [January 27th] The Tani Infantry unit departed from Aomori Station (twice). In addition, more than 800 newly enlisted soldiers of the Matsumoto Regiment, only one month after enlisting, were forcibly ordered to go to Manchuria for intense training. The team began shooting and sword fighting practice on January 22nd and 23rd, and departed from Matsumoto Station in full force on January 30th. It can be said that the entire Hirosaki 8th Division has been dispatched. The main force of this dispatch was selected from soldiers with the strongest cold resistance from the Tohoku region and Hokkaido areas of Japan. However, others, such as a portion of the Azabu 3rd Regiment and the Kofu Regiment, were moved to Utsunomiya, and then selected for departure from Utsunomiya, or directly dispatched from the Kansai and Kyushu areas. The above is only a portion of the investigation during railway transportation. The total number is impossible to investigate concretely, because the Japanese military department is keeping it absolutely secret. What is most noteworthy is that in order to prevent the soldiers being transported to Manchuria from being influenced by red ideas and anti-war propaganda, only two entrance tickets per family were allowed when departing, and only allowed to meet with newly enlisted soldiers. Any other person is absolutely prohibited from talking to the departing soldiers. The seriousness of the alert is evident.</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau is currently working with various educational institutions to draft a literacy program for the people. According to recent statistics, Guangzhou has a population of 1,042,630, of whom 396,924 are illiterate. Men account for 132,460 and women account for 264,464. It is found that the primary schools run by the Education Bureau only number 100, which cannot accommodate so many illiterate people. Moreover, most of the illiterate people are adults. The Education Bureau personnel and educators are currently holding meetings to study remedial methods, and it is expected that thorough methods for promoting universal education will be discussed and agreed upon.

<p>A Reuters dispatch from Munich on the 24th reports that German Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech to a gathering of 30,000 people today in response to the threat from the Bavarian government authorities who proclaimed their intention to secede from the federal government. Hitler said that it is arrogant to want to turn Bavaria into a kind of Austria. If Bavaria makes such an attempt, it will inevitably destroy itself and fail. Hitler also said that his policy does not oppose anyone except the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. If any other political party wants to go to war, then he is prepared to defend the unity of Germany.</p>

Some sources now believe that this move is to mobilize the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers to meet emergency needs and provide them with the rudiments of weaponry. Red newspapers all over Germany have been greatly trampled on, and the public is obviously dissatisfied. Today, Göring also issued an order to the Prussian state local officials, saying that the government will more strictly monitor newspapers that continue to despise the government from now on.

<h3 id="e85">Sun Jimin's Declaration of Leaving the Communist Party <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Reporting the Reasons for Leaving and the Process of Surrender</p>
<p>Stopping the Government's Anti-Japanese Course Again</p>
<p>Sun Jimin, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee, and concurrently Minister of Organization, was indignant at the encroachment of foreign enemies and the critical situation of the country, deeply aware, and resolutely surrendered. At 10:00 this morning, the Information Office of the Municipal Government specially invited reporters from various newspapers to introduce them to Mr. Sun. First, Zhang Tingrong, director of the Information Office of the Municipal Government, and Wang Yonghua, director of the Special Affairs of the Public Security Bureau, introduced him. Then, Sun Jimin stood up and reported the reasons for leaving the Communist Party and the process of surrender. Mr. Sun joined the Communist Party in 1927, studied at the Moscow Chinese University, and returned to China in 1930. He served as the secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, a member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee, and concurrently Minister of Organization. The following is a description of Sun's declaration of leaving the Communist Party:</p>
<p>Declaration of Leaving the Communist Party (1) History is replaying the raging tide of the Great Revolution of 1927, which was interfered with by imperialism and suffered great setbacks. However, if we believe that the failure of the Revolution of 1917 was solely due to the suppression of imperialism, then we have fallen into the trap of fatalism and have fundamentally abandoned the struggle to achieve a complete victory in the Chinese Revolution. The main reason for the failure of the Great Revolution was the error in the leadership of the revolution. However, the Chinese Communist Party's strategy of destroying the unified national line and dispersing the national revolutionary forces is responsible for this error. The current situation is even more serious than it was at that time. The three northeastern provinces have already fallen into the trampling and ravaging of Japanese imperialism, and Jehol and Tianjin are also under the threat of artillery fire from the Japanese warlords. However, although the 400 million people of China have been crying and wailing year after year, they have never been able to inflict a fatal blow on the successive attacks of Japanese imperialism. This is not due to the withering or decline of the Chinese nation, nor is it impossible to resist the blood of imperialism, but because of the division within China, because of the Chinese Communist Party's strategy of splitting the national revolutionary forces, destroying the national revolutionary front, because of the Chinese Communist Party launching strikes and student unrest, intensifying the execution of its bandit-style Soviet revolution, in order to disturb the rear, conspire to subvert the government, and obstruct the government's anti-Japanese line. This situation is no different from that in 1927. Although, the evolution of history is not without education for the 400 million masses of China. The Chinese Communist Party copied the Russian revolutionary experience, thinking that the Russian revolution took advantage of the opportunity of the war and implemented the strategy of [national defeat], [turning the imperialist war into a civil war] to seize political power in Russia, and attempted to [imitate it in China]. However, it is not known that China is a semi-colonial country, and striving for China's freedom and liberation and protecting the motherland is the demand of all Chinese people. The history of national liberation movements in the world proves the absurdity of the Communist Party's claims in the national liberation movement. The Russian revolution, although successfully by chance because of this, however, this wrong path of the Chinese Communist Party is enough to cause it to suffer a cruel defeat. Recently, the shrinking of the Soviet areas, the rapid retreat of urban work, and the Communist Party's separation from the peasant masses, the evolution of history is eliminating the Communist Party's base in China scene by scene.</p>
<p>(2) The honor and disgrace of the Chinese nation and the life and death of the people are completely entrusted to the success or failure of the anti-Japanese war, and whether China can concentrate its national strength to unanimously oppose foreign countries is a prerequisite for the victory of this war. Please see what the Chinese Communist Party has done, none of which is not betraying the interests of the nation. (1) At a time when the national crisis is imminent and Manchuria and North China have fallen under the artillery fire of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese Communist Party is taking advantage of the government and the people concentrating their forces to resist Japan and defend against insults, and then orders the general mobilization of the Red Army throughout the country to strive for the so-called first victory in one or several provinces. In the so-called Soviet area, it implements horizontal levies and violent exactions, and forcibly extracts able-bodied men, so that the people in the Soviet area are groaning and their cries are shaking the sky. Recently, it has taken advantage of the Jehol Incident, with the Red Army in Jiangxi and Fujian as the main force, and the Red Army in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, etc. as the response, to capture Fuzhou and Nanchang.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with military actions, so in the name of the commander-in-chief of the Red Army, he issued a declaration of a general declaration of war against Japan. In fact, this kind of ostrich policy is enough to expose its betrayal of the nation and its conspiracy to destroy the anti-Japanese war. Does the existence of the Red Army in the Chinese Soviet area have any revolutionary significance other than destroying the anti-Japanese war? Even members of the Chinese Communist Party cannot justify it. Even in terms of Marxism and Leninism, the success or failure of the revolution depends on the city as the main factor and the countryside as the guest. However, the Chinese Communist Party falsely exaggerates its bandit policy and then exaggerates, thinking that the leaders of the Chinese revolution are the Red Army and the Soviets who are hidden in the ancient temples of the mountains and forests. Isn't it a daydream? Judging from the facts, wherever the Red Army has set foot, nothing has been done, the land has been barren, the population has been sharply reduced, and the culture has been destroyed. In the past, it was thought that the evil signs in the Soviet area were caused by the Autumn Harvest Uprising line and the Li Lisan half-Trotsky line, but today the Communist Party leadership is everywhere touting the international line and decorating it with Leninism. Then who is to blame? Therefore, the unsuitability of communism to China's national conditions is an iron logic. Even if the Chinese Communist Party hits a wall for another fifteen years, it will not be able to argue. Does the existence of the Red Army in the Chinese Soviet area have any other significance other than destroying the national revolution and splitting the anti-Japanese war? (2) Use the decline of China's economy caused by the imperialist offensive to panic the production of workers and instigate workers to strike, causing chaos in the cities in order to fulfill its conspiracy to destroy production, making workers' lives more painful and increasing the number of unemployed workers. The Chinese Communist Party's strategy of manufacturing strikes and forcing workers to strike has actually reached the end of the road. All the experiences of strikes and struggles have proved that workers' spontaneous struggles can often be victorious, while the struggles led by the Communist Party often fail. This is not accidental, because the strikes led by the Chinese Communist Party are not to protect the interests of the workers, but to sacrifice the interests of the workers in order to create chaos in the rear and deepen the crisis in China's economy in order to weaken the Chinese nation's strength to resist Japan. The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party often blame the mistakes of the lower-level organizations for their inability to carry out strikes and struggles in China. However, facts speak louder than words. All major strikes and struggles have been discussed by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, and even directly commanded by the Standing Committee. However, these events have suffered even greater failures. Even the much-anticipated yarn factory union, which caused a sensation in the party, was only a flash in the pan, and now it has completely disappeared. In the history of the Chinese Communist Party, there has never been a more serious fact of detachment from the workers than now. Perhaps the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party think that this is only a temporary accidental phenomenon, but anyone with a little insight can understand that in China, where national enthusiasm is soaring, it is impossible to take labor-capital disputes as the backbone of its activities, even if it succeeds by chance. (3) The Chinese Communist Party pays special attention to the peasant movement in the areas invaded by Japanese imperialism. Since the so-called Northern Conference denied the imbalance of the development of the Chinese revolution, it has stepped up the deployment of peasant guerrilla warfare in Manchuria, Shandong, Hebei, and other places, because peasant riots in those places can best obstruct the departure of the national army to fight against the Japanese army. The guerrilla war in Rizhao, Shandong, and the peasant riots in Gaoyang and Lixian, Hebei, were all launched from this perspective. As a result, they can only end up with cruel failures. The above points are only a dissection of the current strategy and line of the Chinese Communist Party in the large direction. However, the Communist Party's fate is not only manifested in its policy.</p>
<p>(3) The internal strife within the Chinese Communist Party is particularly fraught with dark secrets. In recent years, so-called opportunist lines have emerged one after another within the Communist Party, and there has been no relatively stable period. After the Li Lisan line, Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, etc., monopolized power, excluded dissidents, used private people to show their importance, and were insidious and arbitrary, so that everyone felt insecure, forming a divided state within the Communist Party. Recently, Communist Party members have been leaving and surrendering one after another, which is also the result of the Communist Party's erroneous leadership line. We believe that in the near future, due to the Communist Party's line hitting a wall and the awareness of lower-level personnel, the internal disintegration of the Communist Party will become even more uncontrollable. Our years of experience working in the Communist Party have made us finally realize the mistakes of the past and resolutely leave the Communist Party. We believe that there are still countless excellent young people in the Communist Party who have been misled by momentary impulses and have gone astray. They will use their own experiences to understand their mistakes and repent and stand together under the banner of the Three People's Principles and work hard for the liberation of the Chinese nation. Although we have declared our departure from the Communist Party organization, we are still willing to maintain private feelings for friends we have known in the Communist Party in the past. If there are those who sympathize with the country and the nation, or those who are still hesitant, and ask for advice, please send a letter to Shanghai Post Office Box 2150, and we will answer them one by one.

<p>One Killed, Three Injured</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. today, two women were riding in a rickshaw, heading north on Minguo Road and entering Xinqiao Street. When passing the Ningbo Hotel, they happened to encounter Annamite constable No. 427 who stepped forward to stop them, claiming that two people cannot ride in a rickshaw together. At the same time, he dug down the rickshaw's license. The woman got out of the car by herself. The rickshaw puller wanted the Annamite constable to return the license because it was dug out, but the constable firmly refused, and must bring the rickshaw puller and two women into the police station together. The two women said that they had something to do, and claimed that they were willing to pay a fine of five jiao to settle the matter, but the constable still refused and beat the rickshaw puller, which aroused the dissatisfaction of onlookers, who gathered to reason with and mediate with the constable. The constable fired a shot at the crowd with a rifle, and the crowd dispersed in all directions. When the Annamite constable fired the gun, Zhu Guting, the clerk of Renhe Grain Store at No. 61 Shoulu Lane, Xinqiao Street, was the first to be hit. The bullet penetrated his abdomen, and fresh blood gushed out, and the large intestine also flowed out of the abdomen with the blood, and he died on the spot. There was still a man behind him, and two women on the rickshaw were also hit by bullets, and their injuries were very serious. After the accident, all the detectives of the French Concession heard the news and rushed to the scene, and took the constable who caused the accident back to the police station, and sent the three injured people to the hospital. The body of the deceased Zhu Guting was sent to Tongren Fuyuantang to wait for the court to examine it.</p>

<h3 id="e93">A New Interpretation of "Rebellion" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Li</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupation of our three northeastern provinces [September 18th Incident] last year and the League of Nations meetings, all dictionaries have had to be rewritten. For example, "aggression" should be interpreted as "self-defense," and "puppet" should be called "independent state." Old dictionaries of ancient history certainly cannot find such a brand new interpretation. The redefinition and completion of everything, such as "organization," "war," and "peace," must be credited to the efforts of the Japanese. This has not only refreshed the dictionary world but is also a monumental work of epoch-making significance. How great! Recently, we have seen a new interpretation of the word "rebellion."</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch on the 20th, the Japanese cabinet, in a report to the special committee, declared that the League of Nations falsely accused our government of sheltering "rebels." This use of the word is truly novel and gratifying, and it is no less than a major discovery in the diplomatic world of the 20th century. I think that apart from the Japanese military and diplomatic circles who created this term, the more than 1.4 billion people in the world can only admire it!</p>
<p>The Japanese are acting out their oriental character very well. They are good at turning over history and seeking antiques. University professors are vigorously advocating that Manchuria and Mongolia are not Chinese territories. It is a pity that they have not deduced it to before the Ming and Qing dynasties, and they have not even mentioned that Korea is a descendant of Jizi. The military has even found the useless Puyi and used him as a cover. With this pitiful monkey, the show can be watched. The dogs who usually tuck their tails also began to wag, and then they pieced together a "puppet state," and then they talked about the so-called "royal way and benevolent government," and then there was the live drama of the so-called "punishing rebels." How terribly nauseating and interesting! This joke is no less than "looking for a donkey while riding one." Here, the Japanese creativity 丨丨 no, it is remaking 丨丨 is not inferior to imitation.</p>
<p>Speaking of "rebellion," the ancient saying is "great rebellion against the Way," which is similar to the meaning of today's "counter-revolution," or perhaps even worse. Hearing these two words, all people involuntarily solemnly and respectfully associate them with the words "extermination of the clan" and "slow slicing." Who is not afraid to say it? But now it comes unintentionally, which is truly excessive. The Japanese are truly good at sophistry. Fortunately, the Japanese use region to determine "obedience" and "rebellion," so only General Zhu Jiqing and Chairman Tang Yulin, who are fighting against the bandits on the front line, and the general Northeastern Volunteer Army are worthy of this crime. From a historical point of view, we were once slaves of the "Great Qing Dynasty." Now that the slaves have actually ascended the throne, the crime of rebellion does not need to be reviewed and is approved to be executed at the Meridian Gate. I think this day will always come, 丨丨 at least it will be proposed, as for whether the head will be cut off, it all depends on whether we rebel thoroughly!</p>
<p>Now I want to say that we have rebelled, we have rebelled. The "Great Qing" overthrew the dragon throne, rebelled against Japan, 丨丨 did not submit to the empire and surrender, but who did Japan rebel against? I want to ask all the 1.25 billion oppressed masses in this world.</p>
<h3 id="e94">New Method of Making Sugar from Scientific Maple Trees <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Nu</p>
<p>In the current time of national crisis, the voices of resisting foreign goods and promoting domestic goods are rising high into the clouds, but they are all verbal resistance. As for practical resistance, there are very few. Therefore, we do not need to talk about resistance, only about promotion methods. The reporter only seeks to discuss the item of white sugar in food products. The annual imports from foreign countries, if one checks the customs registers, the number should be surprising. Therefore, we cannot fail to pay attention to it and study the manufacturing methods to achieve practical resistance. Here is a list of the maple tree sugar making methods, and I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(1) Shape of maple tree: Maple tree is a deciduous tree with leaves shaped like palms. In March and April, it blooms with small red flowers. The fruit has two wings and uses wind power to spread the seeds. It is similar to maple trees and contains sugar, which is very suitable for sugar making.</p>
<p>(2) Taking: In late spring and early summer, the maple sap is most abundant, so at this time, cut an A-shape on the tree trunk and connect it with a bamboo tube. After about ten minutes, sap will flow out of the tube. Use a container to hold it below, but the best time to take the sap is in the morning. If the tree sap is exposed to sunlight and evaporated too late, it will form a crust and be difficult to flow down.</p>
<p>(3) Filtering impurities: Use white silk to make a bag shape, pour the obtained tree sap into the bag, and slowly squeeze it with force. The flowing sap can be put into a pot for cooking and refining.</p>
<p>(4) Cooking and refining: Pour the filtered sap into an iron pot, add fire to steam and cook, and stir with a stick at any time to prevent the sap at the bottom of the pot from burning. If it is burnt, it will taste bitter. After about two hours, the sap gradually thickens into a paste, then reduce the heat and add eggs and milk (about four eggs per fifty catties of thick sap), and five liang of milk.) After mixing evenly, if you see debris and bubbles floating up, use a copper wire mesh to filter them out. After twenty minutes, you can turn off the heat and remove the lid. At this time, the tree sap in the pot will solidify into a semi-fluid when it cools.</p>
<p>(5) Place in an enamel container about three feet five inches long, two feet wide, and three feet high. There are countless small holes at the bottom of the container. Lay a layer of cloth on the bottom, and pour the tree sap that is about to solidify in the pot into the enamel container. At this time, the honey contained in the tree sap will leak out from the small holes. Use a container to hold it, and what you get is pure white sugar.</p>

<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>Spring has come, and the news brought by spring is a trembling of a beautiful painting in nature, and an entangled battle of ten thousand miles of flames among people.</p>
<p>People who are accustomed to living in cities do not feel the change of seasons very much. The oldest nation with a long history is most afraid of sinking into decline.</p>
<p>For example, Shanghai, with its dazzling scenery and towering buildings, has dozens of miles of land all artificialized, with layers of stone and layers of mud, and thick asphalt glued together. Grass and trees cannot take root, and the ground becomes a uniform color in all seasons. There is no fragrance of flowers in spring, no green shade in summer, no colorful red leaves in autumn, and no desolate desolation in winter. Rich young masters and ladies, and wealthy young women, immersed in such an environment, naturally only know that the weather is warm and change into light gauze, and the weather is cold and put on fur coats. Therefore, some people say that people in the city mostly only experience the change of temperature, which is indeed a fitting description.</p>
<p>Our national history is indeed long. From the Yellow Emperor to the present, it has been more than 4,000 years. If we trace back further to Pangu and the pre-historic period, we do not know how many ages there are. One vein has been turning back and forth in the feudal whirlpool. Throughout the dynasties, there have been many foreign races who have ruled. The common people only know that it is the succession of imperial luck and do not feel the sorrow of national decline. You say that the people of Egypt, India, and Goryeo are suffering now? Everyone really doesn't believe it, or they know it so they are startled and alert and invigorate themselves. Ah, the long history and the seniority are the roots of our nation's lack of a way out.</p>
<p>It is already early spring, and spring's smile is already baking in the countryside, but Shanghai is still no different from harsh winter. The city of Shanghai is indeed too big to bear</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The universal illumination of spring.</p>
<p>The nation has reached the line of peril, and the people of the country are still sleeping soundly. At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, it seemed that everyone was still a little angry. During the January 28th Incident, the people of the country once ran around and shouted in an atmosphere of emergency, but what about now? Although the hot war is erupting fiercely, the people of the country are just silent. Apart from some newspapers slightly drumming, what else can we hear?</p>
<p>Especially after the January 28th Incident, Shanghai was simply僵化. Has the flourishing national spirit of the past been extinguished by the gunfire of the Japanese in one fell swoop?</p>
<p>This terrible spring in the city, this terrible decline of the old nation!</p>
<p>If you want to return to the true origin, only the residents of the city can disperse to the countryside!</p>
<p>To transcend the nation, everyone must go to the front line! The news brought by spring is half good and half bad. The good is the beautiful scenery given by nature, which intoxicates our body and soul! The bad is the violent attack of the raging sun on Jehol, plundering. We need to rise up from intoxication, accept the gift of natural beauty, and go to shoot our enemies together.</p>
<p>We should not be too optimistic about the news brought by spring, nor should we only sigh. The era has arrived, and the nation needs our efforts.</p>

<p>K, who had been unemployed for more than a year, got permission from his wife's uncle 丨丨 the deputy president of the S City Chamber of Commerce, thanks to his wife's influence. He actually entered the door of a magnificent, tall, and vast company. How rare this is! Among the unemployed friends, who doesn't congratulate him, who doesn't envy him, envy him for having such a reliable influence, and actually occupying a hard-won position among many petty bourgeois.</p>
<p>On the first day, K felt uneasy: obviously, it was the uneasiness that should be had when entering for the first time. The gazes of colleagues were raw and terrible, and their laughter was刺似的. Those wearing Western-style clothes were even more arrogant, but K had to bow his head, looking at the very wrinkled gray cloth gown on his body, what can be done! Enduring eight hours in silence, he was finally able to restore the comfort of that time.</p>
<p>But: the second day, the third day, still uneasy uneasy and uneasy. In addition to looking down on him, colleagues constantly satirized him, saying things like [to get a high position,] you should find someone with influence to help], and [to want money, you must first marry a wife,] now it's those who rely on their wives who are in the limelight]. Every time he heard these words, he felt pain in his heart. In the afternoon, his wife's uncle 丨 Deputy Chamber of Commerce President came, and several cunning and arrogant people rushed to say: [Mr. So-and-so, your relative is truly young and mature, also simple and silent, and will surely be a promising and capable person in the future.] The uncle wants to save face, and he knows that people are deliberately saying it to him, which is extremely embarrassing. He hurriedly turned around and left, and went to complain to K's wife. [As a company employee, you shouldn't still be like a beggar.] Businessmen rely on facades and socializing. What's the point of not opening your mouth all day long? It's not like a clay Buddha in a dilapidated temple. Running into the company's door, even the ancestors of my three generations have lost face, everyone knows that the relatives of the Deputy Chamber of Commerce President are like beggars.]</p>
<p>When K's wife red-facedly described the difficulties at home, the uncle frowned and ran away.</p>
<p>At half past four, when K returned home, he saw that his wife's eyes were extraordinarily red compared to the past. Ah! Money: Ah! Influence: K finally lost his job again on the fourth day.</p>

<p>Beyond the border, the wind is wild and the wild geese fly high, and the three armies lean on their bows and swords all night long. Let the Tartar horses gallop across the empty forts, who will mend the fold for the lost sheep? The moon over the Black River is bright and the pestles are urgent, the sun sets at Jintai and the pipes and strings are noisy. The traces of the battle of Songshan are still faintly visible, who will pay tribute with turbid wine?</p>
<p>The grass beyond the border is lush and the horses are fat, the wind and sand are vast and where does the traveler return? The battlefield is cold and lonely in the autumn moon, the drums of the garrison have faded and the evening glow is dim. How can Zhao Kuo be the commander-in-chief, and Li Ling should be ashamed of losing our opportunity. Brave men would rather die for the enemy, and patriots raise the banner of righteousness.</p>
<p>The strait and the Great Wall connect the border, how can the battles of the previous dynasties be discussed? The royal spirit of Dongxing remains in the ruins, looking north at the cold clouds pointing to the old garrison (in the east of the Sino-Soviet Railway Hinggan Mountains there is the city) Genghis Khan Tun Station). I shamelessly hold a vain position and neglect my duties, who will summon the souls of those who sacrificed for the national crisis? The events of the neighboring fiefdoms (referring to Korea) are originally worth proving, why resort to endless warfare to establish distant frontiers?</p>

<h3 id="e99">Child Bride <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Féng Yǒuzhāng</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a child under the age of seventeen, and according to the norm, I am still in the golden age of schooling; however, due to the constraints of my environment, I cannot help but drop out of school and go into business. I think that these three years of apprenticeship are really the key to my whole life: if I learn well, I will benefit for a lifetime, and if I don't learn well, I will have no prospects for the rest of my life. Thinking like this, how hard should I work! But my vexing marriage problem prevents me from seizing this key to my whole life and building the foundation of my future without any slack.</p>
<p>When I was five years old, I was engaged to a little girl surnamed Rong through the words of a matchmaker; she has been a child bride in my family since she was a child. She is the daughter of a farmer in the countryside and has never been to school; so she knows nothing about [emotion] [elegance]... I do not have a strong objection to this. The most distressing thing is that her upper limbs are not flexible enough, which makes things very difficult. In addition, she is nearsighted, so she needs someone to serve her.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have various questions; now I will write them down one by one; please reply to me in detail: (1) Ordinary people, when marrying a wife, naturally hope that she can manage the household affairs. Can my fiancée be competent? (2) When she first came to my house, she was very lively, but she became like this after a illness; so should we bear considerable responsibility? (3) Although she is so deformed, my mother loves her very much; if I propose to cancel the engagement, can my future be realized smoothly? (To be continued)</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Feng Youzhang</p>
<p>Editor's note: The system of child brides is very common in Chinese society. It has two drawbacks; first, because the marriage contract was made when they were young, when the boy and girl grow up and become adults, they cannot cooperate with each other, and when they want to cancel the contract, disputes will inevitably arise. Second, because most mothers-in-law are ignorant of reason and regard child brides as slaves, not only do they not give them the opportunity to be educated, but they mostly add unreasonable abuse, so [child bride temper] has become a special idiom. But we believe that if they can be raised by their side like adopted daughters, cherish them, teach them everywhere, and give them as many educational opportunities as possible. After both parties are adults, obtain their consent, and then make an engagement and marriage, then there are advantages. First, because the boy and girl have lived together since they were young, they can naturally understand each other; if they do not express any objection when the engagement is held after adulthood, they must be in agreement. Second, because before marriage, they have long been a part of the family, so they can adapt to everything. Third, because the girl's education is fully provided by the husband's family, the levels of both parties can be equivalent. The above is our general opinion on the [child bride] system.</p>
<p>Now let's discuss Mr. Feng's question. First, Mr. Feng's mother is able to be different from ordinary mothers-in-law and is very fond of her child bride; so I dare to say that her not having gone to school is due to environmental reasons, not because of any discrimination. You see, she has to teach her beloved Mr. Feng to drop out of school and go into business! Fortunately, Mr. Feng's mind is clear in this environment, otherwise he will inevitably seek [emotion] [elegance], but will end up in boredom! Second, ordinary people, when marrying a wife, naturally hope that she can manage the household affairs, but this is not a very difficult task after all, and if she is not disabled, she can barely be competent. According to the letter, Mr. Feng's mother is still very fond of her daughter-in-law, so she is definitely not disabled, at most she is a little deformed. Third, some human diseases can of course be cured, but there are also those that cannot be cured at all. Mr. Feng's fiancée has been raised at home since she was a child, so she must be treated when she gets sick. Mr. Feng's mother, having loved her so much, must have assumed considerable responsibility and treated her; so it can be said that she has fulfilled her responsibilities and does not bear any responsibility. However, we should also pity and support such a poor person. Fourth, because we cannot be very sure about the situation of Mr. Feng's fiancée, we cannot answer his question decisively. Our answer is that if she has not reached the point of being disabled, it may be wise to agree for the sake of pitying her. If she is unfortunately really a disabled person, then she can only cancel the engagement; under these conditions, not only your mother will not insist, but even her parents cannot object.</p>

<p>Saturday brought a bustling and messy scene to the main street. Cafes, clothing stores, goldsmiths, and five-and-dime stores all flaunted their brilliance, illuminating the continuous stream of people along the roadside. Saturday also made everyone feel happy. People leisurely strolled along the road with their wives or innocent female workers.</p>
<p>Customers crowded in and out of store A and store B. The cash registers of the five-and-dime stores were constantly spinning. Hardworking saleswomen ran urgently behind the counters, and friendly customers constantly came and went. Howling cars jammed the crossroads of the main street's red and green traffic lights. The police sucked on cigarettes and spat out the ashes.</p>
<p>[Rest] is the hope of injecting new life into the blood, and the painful joints can barely forget their pain. The tired brains are excited by the bright street lights and attracted by the movie theaters showing interesting films. Burly managers sat behind their desks, planning as they looked out the window. They spent the whole day dreaming of making commercial profits. [Success] is something that everyone can 丨 or should 丨 achieve. The city's poor people live in dark alleys. Some bungalows are Italian taverns, and the cellars are inhabited by Lithuanians and Poles, who are filled with endless grief due to the pain of life. Saturday nights are also lively for them. Accordion music flowed from these houses.</p>
<p>Women wearing wool scarves sneaked out of the taverns with bottles for their husbands. [Why don't you go out, Peter? You've been home for a week. It's Saturday night, you should have fun.]</p>
<p>[Your friends can't see you anywhere, they will forget everything about you.] [Who are my friends, Mary? Everyone is drinking with companions, but after drinking, everyone disperses. In this city, no one can be called my true friend. To tell you the truth, I am very sad about life in the mine, even to the point where everyone, you feel disgusted, and good times are spent in the mine.]</p>
