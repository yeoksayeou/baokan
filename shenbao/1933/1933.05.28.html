<h3>德國軟化後日本又倔强</h3>

<p>阻撓軍縮公約成立</p>

<p>海軍問題會外接洽</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日日本以阻撓軍縮公約之一致同意相恫嚇、要求公約草案之措辭、當使日本對於海軍比率有謀致較優地位之可能、日代表佐藤見其另商海軍新協定之提議、不獲他國贊助後、遂於總委員會宣稱、日本之參加任何公約、將視約内能否不提及華盛頓及倫敦兩約以爲斷、並明白表示、日本正求一較佳之海軍地位即不能與英美實際平等、亦必大增其比率而後可、又謂日本主張軍縮新公約内必須規定依循去年十二月日本提議之原則、商訂一海軍新協定、按日本之提議、大致須英美裁减海軍力、而許日本建造新艦、逈非列强所能贊同、且聞列强均反對在倫敦海軍公約滿期以前、再談海軍實力問題、但日本則現正欲覓一機會、强迫各國商訂一於彼較有利益之噸位恊定、且料非俟獲得某項讓步後、將堅持此種主張云、（二十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　英國所草軍縮公約中之海軍建議、今日續受指摘、日代表提出修正文、要删除第三條、關於二十四條至第二十八條應另訂條約、並隱露如日本修正文被棄不顧、則日本擬不簽字軍縮公約之意、中國代表團宣布中國保留自衛權、小國之代表亦提出修正文若干條、其影響將减弱海軍强國之優勢、英代表艾登答詞中切實聲明英國已减省海軍軍備之半、而今僅請小國維持現率耳、艾登復建議與各代表團舉行談話會、以期迎合諸小國之意見、提出修正文之代表團均贊成此議、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　外務當局以佐藤代表在日内瓦之軍縮演說、除明示倫敦條約限期至一九三六年末此外、並暗示三十五年日本在軍縮會議之原則如下、因根據日滿議定書、帝國政府防守地域增大、故不得不謀海軍兵力之擴充改訂、此不僅倫敦條約之改訂、係要求確認主要國間軍備平等權之原則、認實行軍縮同時確立人種平等之原則、於世界和平有效、認主要國間設立紳士協定或相互協定或促裁裁判條約、於芟除國際間之紛爭有效、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇聯代表杜夫加里夫斯基今日於軍縮會議總委員會批評英國軍縮計劃中之海軍部分、謂此部分計劃之涵義、與蘇聯代表國向所主張之意見、適相反對、該計劃不僅欲承認少數大海軍國與多數小海軍國間之顯著不平等、且徒而增加之、因該計劃果爾實行、則不簽字於華盛頓及倫敦恊定之國家、其海軍發展將受限制、而簽字者尙得繼續增加其海軍也、杜氏繼表示荻蘇聯惟望依據於一船平等原則之裁軍之實現、又云、蘇聯代表國不願對英國此項計劃、提議何種修正、因該計劃旣不規定現有海軍噸量之减縮、且欲爲少數主要海軍國家謀取超過他國之利益、乃蘇聯所不能接受、蘇聯代表國亦反對各主要海軍國以未建成之艦、甚至僅在計劃或打樣中者、均列入現有噸量之計算中、此外蘇聯代表國更反對各主要海軍國對於華府及倫敦協定中所定各級軍艦建造之限制得有例外、而不許他國以同樣之例外、亦反對不許華府及倫敦協定之非簽字國在規定噸量之限度之内、以一種艦代替他種云、（二十六日塔斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>會考質疑　經</h3>
<p>近年來敎育當局。頗有主張畢業會考者。意謂會考制度。爲師中山先生考試之遺意。爲國家頒行之大政。所以促進敎學效率。銓叙眞才。提高文化。蘇浙湘皖諸省以及京滬兩市。且都將舉行。然而此種主張。吾人則認爲尙多可議之處。</p>
<p>吾人固亦絕對主張嚴格敎育者也。近二十年來我國初無一定之敎育方針。今日搬演東洋之制度明日復抄襲歐美之皮毛。視敎育爲兒戲事以靑年爲試騐品。前年九一八事變而後。敎育之頽廢放任。仍如往昔。如再不加以整飭。則長此以往。民旅前途。殆眞將日即於末途。</p>
<p>不過所謂嚴格。初不僅指考試一端而言。尤不在舉行形式上之會考。敎育方針之重新厘定。敎育行政之重新整飭。以至政治與社會環境之改造。吾人皆認爲極爲迫切而重要換言之所謂嚴格。實不僅限於學生一方面敎育當局以至整個社會。無不應以嚴格自律。九一八以來之國難旣爲二十年來政治與敎育不良之惡果。則九一八以後之敎育吾人即應力求其所以異於九一八以前之處。而砦種異同。則又斷不在於學生一方面。尤不在於會考一端。蓋應注意於平日極端嚴格之訓練。考試不遇爲敎育成績一種未必可信頓之揭示也。</p>
<p>今日主張會考者。曰促進敎學效率。銓叙眞提高文化就吾人之所見。則尤不能無疑。敎學效率如何擊於整個敎育制度。擊於整個社會環境。擊於學校當局良否。而不擊於錦標式之考試。尤不擊於「開科取士式」之會考。此理至明。若曰會考爲嚴格檢視學生之成績。則學校中之嚴格考試。應亦即可以負荷此一任務。如以學校之考試爲不可信賴則平日何能以訓練敎育靑年之重責委之學校當局。旣不信賴學校當局。會考又蔣奚益。抑且學校當局旣爲不可信賴。主持會考者又寗獨可信賴歟。</p>
<p>其次所謂銓叙眞材。姑無論所謂「眞材。」决不以銓叙而後出。抑且今日之行政官吏以至敎育當局。又究有幾人爲確由銓叙得來年來考試院舉行盛大之考試。名列榜上者。至今仍多數未得任用。而任用者亦嘗聞有以貪汚獲罪考。則會考之銓叙眞材。又未必可靠至曰提高文化則錦標式之竸爭。足長倖進之心。増利祿之慾。科舉時代之流弊。正由此而來。而謂其能提高文化。吾未敢信。</p>
<p>其尤宜商榷者。僻遠縣邑。貧寒子弟。對於學費之擔負。已極艱難。何堪再增一重旅費之擔負。推其結果。會考將徒爲富家之子弟而開而貧寒子弟。勢將多抱向隅。恐不能無背於敎育之原則也。</p>
<p>總之吾人今日誠絕對主張敎育嚴格然所謂嚴格。在於整個敎育方針。整個敎育制度今都應有一次重新之厘定。蓋今日爲非常時期應有非當時期之敎育。此意吾人固早言之矣。</p>

<h3>部令變更中小學畢業會考</h3>
<p>丨小學會考無庸一律舉行　丨初中可用抽考辦法</p>
<p>河北停止舉行中小學會考　湘敎廳對課程標準意見</p>
<p>敎部頒布中小學學生畢業會考規程程、一年以來、對於各省市之中小學畢業會考嚴厲執行試騐之結果如何、殊難測知、現在將届署假會考之期、各省市敎育廳局根據實際困難情形、呈請敎部變通中小學畢業會考及請求修改會考規程者、日必數起、敎部因格於規程難於照准、但各省市之實際困難、亦未可一概抺煞、故已斟酌各地情形、酌予變通辦理、如二下六日敎部電令河北敎育廳暫緩舉行本届中小學畢業會考、二十七日准蘇敎廳變通各縣小學畢業會考、又如湘敎廳長朱經農呈請初中畢業生准予　抽考辦法、小學則停止舉行畢業會考、並對於中學課程標準請求修改兩點、敎部已准其所請、茲錄敎部原令如下、呈悉、該廳辦理初中學生畢業會考應酌量交通情形、多分颧域、俾易於舉行、如多分區域之後、仍有交通阻礙之學校其舉生實難參加者、姑准予抽考、惟應詳定抽考辦法嚴格限制、呈部核准施行、免滋流弊、初中學生畢業會考、有一二科不及格者、不得以畢凿資格投考升學、其以同等學力投考者聽、所陳關於修改課程之二項意見、（附後）已抄送中小學課程標準編訂委員會核議命考科目、經本部於中小學學生畢業會考暫行規程中、明白規定、自未便有所减損、至小　科目　可完全試騐、或在規定會考科外、再加試一二科目、小學學生畢業會考、應准酌量情形、分别辦理、但無庸一律廢止、以上各點仰卽分别遵照、此令、</p>
<h3>湘敎廳長請求修改中學課程標準之兩項意見</h3>
<p>（一）男女生學習科目與内容應有區别　查會考所訂科目、除初中英文外均係課程暫行標準中規定爲必修之科目、以必修之科目而令學生會考、自不容再有所置議、惟按諸上届會考結果男女學生成績、差異甚大、其中之原因、雖非一端、而男女學生、是否須習同一課程、實爲急待澈究之問題、依照現行課程標準、除軍事訓練與軍事看護而外各科課程、均男女一致、就智力言之、男女兩性、原無絕對差異、惟　性　與需要言之、男女兩性是否盡　相同、誠不能不詳加考慮、又查中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針、内載「女子敎育並須注重陶冶健全之德性保持母性之特質並建設良好之家庭生活及社會生活」等語、是女子敎育、應有其特質、此項特質如欲養成在課程科目與内容兩方面、是否應與男子有所區别、似應加以注意、</p>
<p>（二）高中不分科之不當　查前淸末年中學有文科實科之分、民國十二年施行新學制、高中普通科亦設有第一第二兩組、以聽文理科學生之選擇、治大學院成立後、高中普通科、始不復分組、依照中學法第一條之規定、中學爲升學及就業之凖備、自升學方面言之、凡升學之舉生、對於現代科學智議、固應有相當之了解、以爲研究高深學問之基礎、然預備升入大學文理科之學生、其志願性質、俱不相同高中課程、是否應分别適應、又白就業方面言之、現在課程標準所訂各科敎材、是否爲畢業後就業所必需、似應加以研究、現高中學生具呈來廳請求恢復文理分科制、</p>

<p>第三届浙江全省運動會昨晨九時在杭州梅東高橋前全國運動會塲開幕、天陰微雨、遊行時忽來航空舉校飛機、盤旋空中、散發傳單、足爲會塲點綴、但觀衆不多、開幕演說甚長、省黨部代表與省政府代表二人之演說總共費時逐三刻鐘、此次大會參加田徑競賽者、爲數不多、但組别甚多、興趣减少、會塲布署井然、觀衆多小孩與女子、司令台上、陳列全部獎品、琳琅美目、美不勝收、塲之四週、由男女童運及軍警站崗、秩序甚佳、上午開幕時、天陰微雨、至午後放晴、微露陽光、但如曇花一現、至三時有半、競賽項目正當吃緊之時、忽然陰雲四合、大雨傾盆、觀衆四散逃避、比賽則照常舉行、雨傘失效、運動員及職員、盡成落湯之鷄、往後雨愈下愈急、塲中積水如同澤國、比賽不得不行中止、明日能否舉行、須看天時决定、</p>

<h3>大會花絮</h3>
<p>陳布雷招待忙碌　大會副會長陳布雷、自來浙長敎應後、於體育事業、尤多方提倡、昨晨七時、卽先職員而乘車蒞止、親自督令工役在司令台安排茶點、招待來賓、對惠臨各機關來賓、殷殷招待、並親自分贈每人大會秩序册一本、往返應付、異常忙碌、</p>
<p>指導員諄諄告誡　司令台之左、搭蓋篾棚數座、供各運動員休息、各運動員席地而坐、或擦腿準備比賽、或相互談笑、該隊指導人員（向各賽員面授機宜、對犯規各點、諄諄告誡、期各造成新紀錄、各賽員洗耳恭聽、態度鎭靜、勝算似有成竹、</p>
<p>運動員餓癳肚皮　上午各項運動節目、難袛五種、而每項參加有五六組别之多、次第舉行、致時間延遲、規定爲十二時止、至十二時五十分、尚在比賽中、各運動員淸早即到、至此有飯不能吃、大有餓癳肚皮之概、</p>
<p>觀衆變成落湯鷄　昨日爲星期六、各學校大都停課、下午各校學生結隊而至、會塲觀衆、頓見增多、不料老天無情、四時許忽大雨傾盆、觀衆咸變成落湯之鷄、幸司令台及評判運動宣傳各部、尚可稍作避雨之所、一般女學生、身着單衣、至此曲線畢露、狼狽遁去、</p>
<p>裁判員拖泥帶水　天公旣不照應、而大會比賽項目繁多、須限日趕完、未便停止、總哉判蔣湘靑照常發令、各裁判員欲罷不得、拖泥帶水、照樣進行工作、運動員難大雨之下、精神愈形興奮、足堪欽佩、一般手快脚快之裁判員、向體育塲借得雨傘數把、聊蔽風雨、然其他裁判員苦矣、</p>
<p>席子權充雨傘　大雨歷一小時之久、仍未稍止、反益見風狂雨猛、徑賽田賽、爲環境所迫、不得已宣告停頓、會塲童子軍所搭布棚、失去效用、急急收拾舗蓋、每棚原備蓆子一張、暫時充作雨傘、四人合作一席、赴高級中學躱避全蘇女運動會</p>
<h3>大雨傾盆中舉行　振華女學獲甲組冠軍</h3>
<p>蘇女師得乙組錦標</p>
<p>大會造新紀錄三項</p>
<p>（蘇州二十七日電）全蘇第三届女子聯合運動會、昨（二十七）日下午於大雨傾盆中舉行、觀者達數千人、各校選手、亦精神百倍、初不少雨露怯態、男女來賓、亦咸張蓋兀立大雨中、各項情形、概誌如次、</p>
<p>會場秩序　昨日會場秩序、由務初小學童子運維持、故頗整肅、東吳校門首、另由蘇女中童子運十二名、排列左右、</p>
<p>莊穆儀式　下午二時、舉行開會儀式、各校選手、並列成三個縱隊、面向林堂而立、旗幟　揚、秩序整肅、並由縣立體育塲趄馬治奎、代表敎局長致訓詞、</p>
<p>雨中參觀　舉行開會儀式以後、即開始五十米百米决賽、東吳操塲計週圍四百米、故昨日僅用靠西一端、西邊攔繩外、全爲景海女生、校服潔白、儼如粉堆短垣、至三時許、因大雨滂沱、來賓咸張蓋兀立一角、遙矚宛若少荒漠廣營之累蓬帪、</p>
<p>競賽速記　開賽後、先决賽五十米、甲組計有七人參加、成　張乃琦、僅以一米之差、致居第二、</p>
<p>後甲組跳遠時、第一名爲振華陳定瑞、成績爲三米九四、按陳平時成績原不止此、昨因預賽時足部受微傷、致稍减色云、</p>
<p>又昨日甲乙兩鉛球、均破上届紀錄、甲組預賽、參加逹二十三人、後第一爲黄連珍所得、洵屬不易、</p>
<p>甲組百米决賽、爲振華一校包辦、初不料該校人才之平均猛普、有如是速也、</p>

<h3>談風月</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>莫談國事，且談風月·然而從風月二字的形態上觀察起來，風月亦未必便談得。</p>
<p>看風字的頭，儼然有泱泱大國的氣度，而月字的頭，也頗有具體而微的小朝庭之概，所不同的，不過是下面的開放與封銷耳。國字把四圍邊境守住，圍成一個圈子，而風月是不管這此閒賑的。上爲天，下爲地，天南地北，北地不守，風月就象徵了這事，難道國難之來，是因風月而起的嗎？</p>
<p>從頭頂表面看去，儼然有泱泱大國氣度的風字，而堂哉皇哉踞坐中，却是一個虫。縱使這個虫字上面還有像平天冠似的一撇，虫仍還不過是虫哩，要想弄得像樣子，豈不是很困難。至於月字，在一個邊境不守的小範圍之内，却横互了二劃，大有兩不相下之勢，如何能彀希望和衷共濟，一致對外。獨怪倉頡造字，何以把風月造成這個樣子。</p>
<p>現在又把風月二字連到一起來了，從有泱泱大國氣度的，接到具體而微的小朝庭·頗有北宋南宋遞代之景象·大是不祥之兆。這樣一想，風月二字，實在不能隨便寫下，何况是談。所謂談，不厭其多，從各方面來的觀感的　陳。</p>
<p>這樣看來，國事固然不大好談，風月也大談不得的道理，如要談，只能於風月國事之外，另找題目，而頂可以作爲模範的，又莫過於「今天天氣哈哈哈」了。因爲倘使你說天氣沈悶不好，便有毁謗的嫌疑，而說太陽出得很好，又是擁護日本國旗而被派爲漢奸賣國賊了。只有在今天天氣之下來一個不着邊際的哈哈哈，是頂聰敏的辦法。</p>
<p>關於風月二字，作了一次拆字式的考察，閘明了其中有不可談的道，但我們有口必須談此什麽，而安全又是人人所希望的，我們便不能不愼重考慮，對於談些什麽，才能確保安全而又可不負天生此口，希望海内同文，大家從長計議一番。</p>
<h3>簫伯訥論讀物</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>（四月二十九日英國披亞孫週刋Pearsons　Weekly載蕭伯訥對香港大學學生的訓話，說穿讀書秘訣，而痛詆時下記問之學，誤人予弟。證之東方鄭板橋所謂讀書人應　起脊骨的話，當可知古今英雄所見略同，决不是滑稽騙人的話。靑年不速　起脊骨，道聽塗說，人云亦云，騙分數，騙文憑，答先生所要你答，而取得甲乙優上以自豪者，讀此應當有學悟上當之聰明，若並此聰明而没有，便只好取文憑，做洋八股，趕緊得秀士碩士，甚至博士，爲社會有用人才，候人宰割。該篇原係紀錄式，不署名，茲特爲譯出並介紹。）</p>
<p>我有堅確的主張，世上各大學都應拆毁下來，連牆帶屋的耙成平土，還須撒鹽於其基址上面。</p>
<p>我常提醒人家，不久以前，文化幾乎由大戰而漬滅。我们尚未知道，那次大戰是否已將文化全部消滅，但是這也没多大關係，因爲這次大戰已經證明一樣，就是原來世上並没有多少文化。</p>
<p>那個戰爭是受大學敎育的人所造成的。世上實有　種最危險的階級。一種是受半敎育的人，這此已毁滅文化之一半。又一種人是全受敎育的，他們幾乎完全消滅世界。</p>
<p>你們應該細續配特利敎授Professor　FlindorsPetrie的書。</p>
<p>我少年時丨那是不可思議的古時丨没人知道古代文明是怎樣。我們僅知道一點關於希臘與羅馬的消息。不知息樣，羅馬潰滅而剩下一個黑暗時代，介是在配特利敎授發掘古代文明遺跡以前，没人知道我們以前有多少種跟我們相同的文明。這些文明幾乎都是由敎育而潰滅。我想那緣故是因爲要使文明不潰滅，我們須有比較能夠獨出心裁的頭腦（original　Minds）。</p>
<p>然而大學僅能養成機械的頭腦（Artificial　Mnds）。你們到這裹來，而他們把你們的頭腦挖出，換上一副機械的頭腦。因此，我預知我們的文化也要完全潰滅，卽復轉入黑暗時代。</p>
<p>自然我不知你們將要怎樣决擇。你們也許要問，「我門應該離開大學嗎？」或是「我們應否到街上去？」</p>
<p>我不知道。大學裹也可得一點益處。你們可得一種團體的生活，這是很有益的，假使我有兒子，也要勸他上學。</p>
<p>我要送他人大學而對他說：「你們要謹防他們給你裝上一副機械的頭腦。至於他們要你讀的書，切不可讀」。</p>
<p>一本學校敎本，照界說講，就是讀不得的書。我所以能成爲全未受敎育的人，就是因爲我未曾讀過學校的敎科書。</p>
<p>他們規定我應讀敎科書之時，我正在讀眞正的書丨眞正會寫的作家的書。敎科書的作者永不會屬於這一類。</p>
<p>所以我說，要小心讀眞正的書，而敎科書也應讀到可以避免被侮辱開除的程度。</p>
<p>讀好的書，眞正的書，而埋頭去鑽研革命的書籍。要埋頭於ＸＸ主義及凡　此一類的理論。假如你二十歳時，不開始革命，那末五十歳時，只能變成老朽的化石。假如你二十嵗時是ＸＸ的革命家，那末四十歲時，也許有點不落伍的希望。</p>
<p>我只能對你們一切的人說：依着我指出的方向走去。時時與你們的師長爭辯。如果你們有一位歷史敎授已敎過你們他的歷史觀，你們如果可能，應向他說「喂，打住，我們已聽見你的意見了，但是你們正要找一位與你意見相反的敎授。讓我們聽聽你們兩位怎樣辯法。」</p>
<p>凡學一件東西，都是反復駁難。你們要發見，老是有一種陰謀，要武斷的呌你們單看事物的一而而已。有許多靑年入大學，本來是不配敎導的，但是又必須給他學位：結果只能呌他們怎樣答問。</p>
<p>假如你敎他們問題的正反兩面，他們就要頭腦昏賑。如果你要考試及格，萬不可探求是非的究竟。你只要走上去問先生：「你心目中要我怎樣答復這一問？」</p>
<p>好了，我得這機會在你們腦中放毒，心上非常愉快。我希望你們聽了暫時覺得好笑，過一禮拜就都能遺忘。</p>
<p>在我年靑時代，我是一位批評家。我常爲一週刋做劇評及藝術評論。我凡去參觀藝術展覧會丨比如說皇家醫院丨我心裹明白只能寫一篇批評的文章。最多寫兩篇，但是展覽會上却有兩三千幅的圖畫。我的辦法，就是趕緊泛覧一下，揀十二或十五張不是「醜陋不堪」的來批評。</p>
<p>你們也應取這個辦法。當你們的敎授導師偶然要灌輸知　給你們時，你們得說，「不値得銘記的東西我不要」。</p>
<p>你們須像檢垃圾的人，在歷史的垃圾堆中打量一下，看看檢來的東西的價値，把有價値的記住，其餘的丢開。</p>
<p>這樣你們便成了受敎育的人；腦裹盤桓着値得銘記的東西。能夠記憶一切不値得銘記的人，常得着最高的學位。對於這種人，我們只有一種對付的方法，就是埋葬他。</p>
<h3>夜的街頭</h3>
<p>— 方之中</p>
<p>雨後的街樹·綠色的外衣上綴着金碧的珠球，如同少女浴後，被着輕紗，亭亭玉立在道傍。電炬，從街樹的濃陰隙裹，偷看任人踐踏而不留絲毫跡痕的柏油路面和同步同調的一對靑年的男女，可是蜷伏在紅牆角落深處的乞丐，皎皎的光波，却永遠不會照臨到他。</p>
<p>「少爺，奶奶丨…積德丨…我三天没吃飯了！」紅牆角落裹發出了抽咽的慘呼。</p>
<p>在這靜肅而高潔的馬路上，丨高等華人和友邦的上層階級的住宿區域，竟會有着乞丐的呻吟，這眞是殺風景的事！他們輕輕地覷了一眼，又回頭踱着同樣的闊步。</p>
<p>從一列一列的汽車眼球和街燈的浮光裹，很淸晰地看見她是中等身材，樸素而整潔的學生裝束，豐腴的面上，泛着靑春的熱力；他呢？西裝革履，長而且瘦。　的頭斜欹在他的肩上，他的手緊貼在她的腰際，他倆在細語着，密談着，相倚相伴地走着。</p>
<p>迎面飛來了陣陣的爵士音樂，這自然比乞兒的慘呼特别悅耳。</p>
<p>「跳舞塲去吧？」他吻着她的上髮。</p>
<p>她搖頭，不說什麽；他呑着聲，說不出什麽。暫時沉默，只聽得出足下發出有節奏的蠧蠧聲音。</p>
<p>「大晚夜報丨要看看東洋賊佬進攻平津丨要看看東洋賊佬吃敗仗丨……四個銅板一張。」</p>
<p>報販子的低喉音雖然打破了周圍的沉寂，可是却呌不起他倆的注意。</p>
<p>微風挾凉意吹來。</p>
<p>「我有黠冷。」她說。</p>
<p>他無語地帮她空上大衣後，又回復原有的姿式向着燈火琳瑯的XXX那兒前進。</p>
<p>那兒有着更多的報販的破喉，也有更多的乞兒的慘呼，但這是根本没有剌戟性的！他倆仍舊在亭亭玉立的街樹下踱着闊步，並肩挽手地切切密談。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Kenaro作　林取釋</p>
<p>風（續）</p>
<p>雷辟克依着他的習慣，由這個窗户邊走到那個窗户邊。他反覆地看着兩個孩子的學期成績表，尤其注意的是公立中學校長親筆寫的通知單：關於大哥菲利克斯的那張是：</p>
<p>「性情浮燥，但人還聰明。前途有望。」</p>
<p>關於紅蘿蔔鬚的那張是：</p>
<p>「一旦用則成功績優異，但不常用功耳。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚有時會成績優異這一念頭頗使得一家人感覺興味。他這時兩手交义擱在膝上，把脚浸在水裹，非常快榮。他感覺大家大審視他。其實人家却學得他披着那頭劉得大長的深紅色的頭髮，顯得怪醜的樣子。不願意把眞情流露出來的雷辟克，祇在和他開着玩笑的行爲裹面表未他的喜悅。他走過去時候，把指頭在他的耳朶上彈一下；走回來的時候，又用肘把他推一下。紅蘿蔔鬚便很開心地笑着。</p>
<p>末後，雷辟克把手放在他那紛亂的頭髮裹面，彈着指甲，好像要給他揑死一些虱子似的。</p>
<p>這是他寵爱人家的玩笑。</p>
<p>可是，第一下他便揑死了一隻。</p>
<p>「啊·我揑中了啦！」他說，「我没有落空啦。」</p>
<p>當他稍許感着嫌惡，反手指揩在紅蘿蔔鬚的頭髮上時，雷辟克家的便把把兩臂高高攀起：</p>
<p>「我早就疑到了，她顯得非常難受的樣子說。「天啊！我們這才乾凈啦·愛勒絲」，快點去拿一個而盆來，你現在有事幹了啦。」</p>
<p>姐姐愛勒絲丁拿來了個面盆，一把箆子，一雙小碟子盛着一點兒醋，於是開始捕捉。</p>
<p>「先給我箆罷！」大哥菲利克斯呌說。「我相信他一定給我了。」</p>
<p>他把手指猛烈地搔着腦袋，要别人給他一桶水把頭完全浸在裹面。</p>
<p>「不要閙，菲利克斯，」姐姐愛勒絲丁說，她是喜歡替别人出力的，「我不會把你弄痛的。」　　她把一塊布圍着他的頸根，使出媽媽對於兒子的那種細心和忍耐。她用一隻手分開頭髮，另一隻手輕輕地拿着箆子，她旣不現着討厭的樣子，也不現着害怕惹到自已身上來的樣子，她給他尋覓虱子。</p>
<p>每當她說着：又一個！大哥菲利克斯便把兩脚蹴着桶底，握着拳頭威嚇紅蘿蔔鬚，他呢，却一聲不響在等着輪到他頭上來。</p>
<p>「你已經完了，菲利克斯，」姐姐愛勒絲丁說，「你祇有七八個；你可以去數啦。現在再來看紅蘿蔔鬚有多少罷。」</p>
<p>在第一箆，紅蘿蔔鬚所得的就不止此數。姐姐愛勒絲丁以爲萞中了虱窩，其實她不過偶然撈着一羣罷了。</p>
<p>大家站在紅蘿蔔鬚身旁。姐姐愛勒絲丁專心箆着。雷辟克把兩手放在背後，像一個好奇的陌生人似的看着愛勒絲丁工作。雷辟克家的則不時的發着怨歎。</p>
<p>「啊！啊！」她說，「這得有一隻剷子和一隻耙子才行。」</p>
<p>大哥菲利克斯蹲在地上搖着面盆收接箆下來的虱。這些虱是連着頭皮一同落下的。我們看得出牠們那像睫毛一般細小的脚在動着。牠們在面盆裹面被人搖去，一會兒便給醋弄死了。</p>

<h3>替男子不平</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>婦女抬頭的年頭兒，做男子的當然有許多不平的事；但我做的「替男子不平」一篇文字，並非爲着婦女抬頭而發生的感想。便是婦女不抬頭，做男子的也擔受着兩種「寃枉孽障的苦痛；什麽兩種？聽我道來：　　（一）男婦兩字的會意，力田是男，帚女是婦；可見掮一柄耜頭！是男子的本分，挾一把掃帶，是婦人的天職了。照例，馬路上的掃街職役，城市中的淸道小工，都該是婦人充當的了；然而不然。只有掃街夫，没有掃街婆；只有淸道夫，没有淸道婆；是何因緣，竟把婦字旁邊的掃帚，引渡到男子手裏來了？唉！冤枉孽障！</p>
<p>（二）爲着漢朝是中國强盛的時代，所以，中國人稱漢人；推廣言之，做男子的，便是漢子；好男子，便是奸漢；這是何等榮耀的事啊！自從有了漢奸兩個字，倒被婦妇說的嘴響；「漢奸，漢奸，都是漢子做的；所以，做那日人的倀鬼的，人人都駡一聲漢奸，而不駡一聲婆奸，可見做漢奸的是漢子專業了。」然而，不然。奸細裏面，儘有許多女奸細；一旦破露以後，人人也駡伊一聲漢奸，而不特别贈給伊一個婆奸的名號；做漢子的，活該倒霉了。唉！寃枉孽障！</p>
<h3>莫談國事</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>在不拘息一家茶館店裏，總是高掛着「謹防扒手」的牌子。有些把穩些的茶博士，索性再在「謹防扒手」之旁，黏上一張紅紙條兒，寫着「莫談國事」。其實談談國事，打甚麽緊，只須不要亂談，就得了。例如「我軍大刀隊，殺得敵軍捧着腦袋喊爸爸　不迭」，那麽，儘說敵軍怎地怎地地膿包，準不會被人當作「漢奸」·「敵探」·「搗亂份子」。若是「我軍退兵神速」，或是「因戰略關係，改守新陣線」，而尊駕「談國事」的所在，奇不奇，巧不巧，恰在「沉著應戰的那道新陳線之外，那麽，一嘴的「王道」，「樂土」就是形容敵兵的輪姦某老婦，至少也得說一聲「老婦何幸」。這我可拍胸膛兒擔保儘談國事，一世不會砍頭。　　「莫談國事」，茶館店裏的「橋頭三阿爸」們，或許還可以敬遵茶博士的台命，但是靠「談國事」騙麵包的新聞記者，若也把「莫談國事」奉作玉律金科，那不是糟糕糟透了頂麽？</p>
<p>其實不然，新聞記者「談國事」，自有其法門。譬如說，在上者說一句「苦命的中國人」，新聞記者便在「苦命」二字上發揮盡致，再如元老們說，「小夥子何罪，罪在老頭兒」，那麽，新聞記者搖筆直書曰，「年高德劭之元老何罪，罪在不問國事之老百姓也」。新聞記者如此這般「談國事」而「領導與論」，準不會抗濕木梢，或許還能一躍而到地位。所以恪遵着「莫談國事」者，是天下的一等大傻子。「談國事」而不看風向者，亦是大傻瓜。</p>
<h3>洪佛矢的小說</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>說起來這件事，已經有二十餘年了。在革命歷史上，也許有些紀載的價値吧。當亡淸光緖季年，親貴專政，國是日非，朝廷把「預備立憲」的話頭，來欺騙民衆。幾位先覺志士，便借辦報爲鼓吹革命的喉舌，雖然當時文網尚密，只得匣劍帷鐙，言中有物：可是一股「朝氣」，似比目下的報紙，還要遂勃。于騷心（右任）辦張「民呼報」，不久，被淸廷封禁；于先生就把「呼」字的兩眼剜去，「民吁報」便出現了。恰巧這時候，浙江閙着滬杭甬鐵路風潮，總辦湯蟄仙（壽潛）辦起天鐸報來。聘慈谿陳天嬰（訓正）做總理；洪佛矢（允祥）做總主筆，馮死公（开）擔任小說，胡飄瓦（良箴）做編輯，除了湯先生以外，完全是阿拉慈谿人淸一色。天鐸出版以後，在報界忽然放一異彩，有浩浩蕩蕩的佛矢社論，很有飲冰室主人的作風：有淸麗典雅的死公筆記和小說，足與當時平等閣筆記，冷血天笑的說部，大家來出風頭。</p>
<p>可是這時候，申新兩報以商界爲立塲，並不帶甚麽色彩。時報似乎和梁任公一派接近。（今之時報，已非狄平子所辦，性質完全改變）。民吁帶些火氣，天鐸别有風味，含了革命排滿性貨，是一樣的。後來天鐸又請了一位戴天仇（傳賢），便是今之考試院長；一位陳布雷（訓恩），便是今是浙敎廳長：兩位都是年少英俊，論文恣肆排奡，喚起當時頽唐的民氣不少。後來李懷霜（葭榮）來繼任總主筆之職，柳亞子（棄疾）來做編輯，鄒亞雲（銓）編小品，都是南社健將，革命已經成功，而天鐸報正在黄金時代啊。</p>
<p>現在我來談談洪先生吧。洪先生，慈谿山北人，諱允祥，字樵舲，「佛矢」「慘佛」「天醉」，都是天鐸報上的筆名。先生早歲，游學日本；性嗜酒，擅詩文，歷任南北各大學史地都授。在下嘗以「寗波吳稚暉」目之，然吳滑稽，洪則耿直，而學識很相同吓。先生對於佛學的功夫很深，和四川謝旡量（蒙）相友善，上月先生逝世，謝撰一輓聯道：「荷鐸恣游行，酒徒慷慨能愛國：據梧成嘯傲，詩卷縱横尚滿家」。把「酒徒」「詩人」來稱先生，先生九泉有知，一定很贊成咧。先生做過一篇「劉儈之女」，是道家的小說。「莽和尙之姊」，是佛家的小說，兩篇筆法都像唐人，和曼殊和尙的小說，有異曲同工之妙，驚才絕艶，眞非碌碌餘子所能及，稱先生爲「小說家」，何嘗不可。</p>
<h3>回力球塲</h3>
<p>— 傳之</p>
<p>别克，美通，福特，紅的，黑的，橙黄色的各種汽車，排滿了靠近霞飛路的亞爾培路口；蔭鬰翠碧的悟桐，和回力球場門外西文的電燈廣告，紅緣相間，輝映成趣，偶然經過，幾疑世外桃源·</p>
<p>球員已在獻身手了，萬道眼光不約而同的把視線集中於一個焦點丨回力球：球場兩邊的最高處，各懸着賭賽勝負記數的鉛板（Score　Board），標着次數（Event　No.）分數（Points）勝（W.）和球員名字Romas.　Olberdi一類的西文·　　「雙獨贏啦（Double　Win）!」一個赤足露臂的外國少奶奶；向着一個像肉莊裏灌過水似的猪玀般的中年貴婦喊着·</p>
<p>一個白衣待者，笑嘻嘻的送着一疊鈔票過來，一張張的算給那個中年貴婦，大槪是十元一張，吧！白衣侍者算完鈔票之後，兩個黑朣子釘視着那個中年貴婦不動，看來候伊給賞錢的神氣；但伊並不注意到這些，正和另一個外國貴婦在談些什麽·白衣侍者知道失望了，便把眼睛一瞅，鼻子一皺的掉頭去應付其他賭客了·</p>
<p>大肚皮的張三，把十元的鈔票交給甲侍者去買票子（注·賭票），姿態婀娜的王小姐，又從皮包裏掏出五元的鈔票數張交給乙侍者去買票子；一會兒甲侍者執着一大疊票子到這兒來分散，丙侍者丁侍者也同樣執着一大疊票子到那兒去分散，我便在這個鈔票和賭票來去的當中昏暓，胡思··</p>
<p>「報載Ｘ國鬧着經濟恐慌，Ｘ國失業人數已逹ＸＸＸ萬，ＸＸ地方餓莩載道，媽的，造什麽謠言？」但不知麽的？我的手會無意識地攅進袋子去，使勁一摸，只剩下兩個毫子在袋裏··</p>
<p>「老傅丨你有資格到這兒來玩？你的家裏正等着你的錢去買米呢丨」</p>
<p>我自言自語的痛駡自已，終於没精打采跑了出來·</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第七回　數語絕恩情閉門痛哭　一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>可是他毫不介意，將手一拍胸道；我們當兵的，兩隻肩膀，挑着一個忠字和一個義字，天職就是流血，流血是家常便飯。在這種情况之下，我們要家庭作什麽，乾脆，一個人留着兩隻手胳膀抗槍桿兒得了。三位連長，聽了這話，精神都很是興奮，情不自禁的，臉上紅紅的。祇有趙翁端了酒杯子喝酒，手摸了鬍子，却是默然無語。關耀武笑道：别說了，老太爺看着這種樣子，有些說大話救命了。趙翁搖搖頭道：你看到我没有作聲，以爲我不贊成你們這些話嗎？那可不然。我覺得當軍人的人，都聽該替國家挑挑擔子。譬如我們當米店裏掌櫃的·都應該去和東家挑挑擔子。要這個樣子，才對得住平常棒着人家一隻飯碗。俗言道：養兵千日，用在一朝，平常要你們幹什麽？不就是除了上操而外，要你們知道怎樣保護國家，挑着一副什麽擔子嗎？我不作聲，我是另有一個念頭。說着，又端起酒杯子來，在杯沿上，慢慢的抵着酒喝，心裏有一句話，想要說出來，他别一隻手摸了幾摸鬍子梢，再轉了一個念頭，把他想說的話，又忍了下去了。田靑心裏想着，今天到趙家來赴春飲，是要引着老太爺開心的。現在大家說的話，老太爺表面雖願意聽，心裏可感着難受，這樣的只管說下去，大家要閙得不歡而散的了。於是在趙自强面前，拿過酒壼來，搖搖着沙隆沙響了幾下，站起來笑道：我應當敬老太爺一杯洒，但不知老太爺可賞光。趙翁道：我倒是勉强可以喝一杯，但不知道自强可讓我喝一杯。（八三）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<h3>兒童之國際戰</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>狹路揮拳　初夏的早上，滬西善　路上，兩旁行人絡繹，華洋相雜，長幼咸具。一個白種孩子，六七齡的白種孩子，踽踽地　行着。對面行來兩個十歲左右的華童，與白童交臂而過時，一童仲手撫他的面，撫後還狂笑，顯然有侮辱他的意義·這個白童處於當前兩個較他高大的强敵之下，照理。他祇有駭怕，號哭，掩着滬眼歸去訴請爸爸媽媽，以求失之東隅收之桑榆的安慰·但是他不，决不，說時遲，那時快，他天眞的笑臉，立刻敷上一層冰霜，秀美的雙眉，立刻豎起來，玲瓏的眼珠，立刻睜起來，一個笑容可掬的白童，立刻變爲猙獰可怖的小魔王·這時兩華童還立在距他三尺之地而笑聲未已，見他怒目，更接續着笑·白童的小拳緊握起來了，出於兩華童的不意，向其中知得最劇烈的一個小肚子上一拳，接着一拳揮向笑得和平些一個身上去，給對方一縮而打了一個空·他益發僨怒了，終於追上去打着一拳·先被打的小肚子上着了痛，立刻止了他的笑聲，收拾起他的笑容，並乘他打他的同伴時，在他背上下了一下冷拳·白童背後　着攻擊，立卽轉過來把拳揮去·又恐腹背受敵，回視後者，見他没有攻擊之肰，便用他的全力於一方，一個握得緊緊的小拳，接連揮上前去·我們的黄童忽不敢懋戰，仲了兩手，一面推拒，一面後退·白童節節進逼，黄童步步退讓，雖没有蹩土百里，但白童已追奔一丈之遙了·旁觀中的一位老者，見這一幕國際戰爭之不宜糾結下去，乃挻身而出，義不容辭的做了他們中間的國際警察，這才白童停止了進逼，黄童也不且抗且退了·老者厲聲對黄童說：無端侮人，罪有應得，打了又不敢抵抗，眞是没用的東西，去！黄童似自知理曲並覺慚愧而去了，吃了一拳就始終遙立觀米的一個也返身行了·白童呢？他憤怒之色稍退，換上一絲笑顏來，我知道他心中感到勝利的愉快·他已不需要人家的安慰，不顧一切的去了·我望着他去，望着這小戰士去，我學他的不畏强禦，大無畏的精神，不屈不撓的意志，獨斷鄉行的毅力，都是使我欽敬·我遙望他到一間道要轉進去了，不覺脫口呼口··小戰士！你這個世界之適者，你是這個世界之支配者·</p>
<p>隔河飛彈　兆豐公園的一面離外，有一條小溪彎彎護着；溪的岸上是土路，直通曹家渡市塵·一個春暮之傍晚，我行過這裏，三五頑童在且走且唱·隔河園中兩西童，忽取一泥塊戲擲他們，而適中一頑童的頭顱·他也立拾一丸飛敬過云·那邊自然非弱者，兩童都雙手抓了泥飛過來·這裏見他們合力攻擊，也就同心禦侮，拾了泥土，接連投過去，一時隔河立陣，泥來土去，彈雨紛飛·雙方都不呐喊，祇是沉着應戰，也有投着的，也有落在岸下的，而也有落在水中，浪花處處飛濺·這時園中走來三個我黄膚之童，忽這邊一彈飛去，適中其中一個之帽·他立取下帽來一看，見已着汚，頓時起了他的憤怒，俯身下去，握泥擲過來，他祗知道遭了損害，而忘掉這是黄白之爭，而自已是黄者的同胞·這裏的頑童見他爲虎作倀，便立刻高哹漢奸漢奸·漢奸，人人羞爲的漢奸，那邊的聽到駡他漢奸，果然覺悟起來，　了未擲的一彈而退後去立着遙觀·最後西童以寡不敵衆，且戰且退而没入林中，而這裏憤恨得還向林中飛了數彈才罷手·我因阴们流彈，不獲前進，這一幕國際戰，又給我看個痛快·三五頑童之合力抵抗，我佩望他們的勇敢，爲他們忻喜將來在這個世界上有立足處·那邊一個漢奸，覺悟得快，也令我起敬·受着侮能抵抗，錯誤了知侮改，在我們是的一代願其個個如此·</p>

<p>業餘周刑</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>從　　經濟　潰說到　市兩　　　　　　主義　　　　入了中國　村以後，一方面使中國的農業生　加連　的商品係於是農村中國需要的日常用品，就愈加要仰給於充　者　　品的市塲：另一方面，被壞了作爲農村中副業的家庭手工業，使它與農業稅雌而逐漸需獨立的生產部門。前者增加丁農民底支出，後者滅少了農民底收入，因此農民便易於受到饑饖阍威骨。捐稅底　繁，地租底重累，商業和商利貸資本底剌骨的剝削，這些都是封建勢力對於農民大衆的　取，加緊了農民貧窮化底過程。同時還有往往以各帝國主義者自身問底　突爲背景的中國軍閥們底内戰，它更使農民擔負着戰前的給養，戰時的征派，騷擾，毁滅丨所謂兵災丨和戰後的種種善後費。處於這樣的貧窮化的過程中的中國農民大衆，他們便不得不逐漸縮小他們底生產範圍，農耕技術只有日益拙劣，再也没有改進的可能。至於水利底改善，自然是更談不到。這些都是中國農材經濟崩潰底要質所反映出來的重要諸現象，换言之，中國農村經濟是在帝國主義底經濟侵略和封建勢力底雙重剝削之下而崩潰了。</p>
<p>歷年來的中國各市交互地或連續地發生的天災人禍，都不過是中國農村經濟崩潰底一般的形態，尤其是前年的大水災和去年的豐收成災更表現了這形態底普遍化和深刻化。</p>
<p>中國農村經濟崩潰的結果，除造成死亡，流離，盜匪，騷動外，還造成了農民購買力的再度低降，中國市塲的再度縮小。這對於工業說來，至少要發生兩種的影響。其一是工業製造品的銷路更爲縮小；城市工業不僅失去了擴大的基礎，而且勢必至於收縮。其二是大批失業的農民，構成了城市與鄉村勞動力底市塲的擁擠情形，使工資普遍的減低，勞動者生活普遍的貧窮化，勞動者購買力低落，而市塲便又一度的縮小，工業又須緊一層的收縮。</p>
<p>且看中國各部門底工業，無論是舊式的特產業或新式的機製品業，近來都凋零不堪。譬如著名的杭州綢業，其衰落的狀况眞是不堪設想，因而有停工的趨勢。舊式的絲紡織業是如此，新式的紡織業也並不比它高明。最近上海紗廠的減工，固然說是受到日貨傾銷的影響，但歷來銷路的縮小，也不能說是没有關係的吧。</p>
<p>那未，都市的商業又將怎樣，它是否可以單獨避免這種危機而繁榮呢？這兒且僅就最顯明的銷路這一事實作爲根據來說明。</p>
<p>近年來，尤其是最近，因縮小了的市塲上容納不下那雖已縮小了的生產量，乃造成了一種大減價的怪現象。這種現象現在是普遍於全中國，無論在那個地方，各商號的門前，通常都是花樣日新，或云大减價，或云送贈品，或則謂打倒折扣……。偶爾步行街中，那些綢緞廣告單，藥店，茶店，鞋莊的傳單，就可接到若干張，好像是顧主百年没有上他們的門來的一樣，開從來各地未有的現象。至如定期減價者，必有爲幾週紀念的盛會和適應時令的春夏秋冬各季的照例舉行；更於滿期以後，藉品酬謝主顧們的惠賜，再行展期，連續不斷地迄無已時。素稱繁盛的上海，算是消費者最集中的地方，這種減價的現象，也是連續不斷的發生着。各馬路的大公司和商店門前臨風招展的大減價旗子，或留聲機收音機的播送，爭相盡其以廣招徠的能事，甚至於在廉價期中，還有所謂特别廉價的貨品等等。這此，從表面上看來，好像是熱閙的盛舉，但在實質上又何嘗不是都市商業蕭條的景况呢！</p>
<h3>生活我賣掉了我的眼睛</h3>
<p>— 臻新</p>
<p>（對校）　我棄了小學敎員的位置而到書店裏充當校對的理由，大致有下面兩個，但到現在，纔知道這是兩個完全不成其爲理由的理由。</p>
<p>一，工作容易，凡没有當過校對的人，都不約而同的以爲校對是文塲中最容易的工作，只要能看書，各種科學的智識稍稍有一點，充當校對是綽綽有餘的；我當初也以爲這樣。其實大不然。厚厚的一本十萬或二十萬　的書，要使一個字不錯是可能的嗎？潦草而糊塗的原稿，具有各派各路的筆調，叙述各種各樣的專門學問，以及模糊的校樣，反白光的油光紙，在這種狀態之下，要使字不錯是可能的嗎？况且還要注意最易忽略的頁碼，標題，邊脊，說不定印刷工友們偷偷地給你拆點不易發覺的爛汚，這樣，要使字不錯是可能的嗎？現在我確信當校對要比當編輯難。</p>
<p>二·多得智識，這種想頭也是誰都有的，以爲做校對，可以免費地看許多書，長進許多學識。當初我何嘗不是這樣想呢？但現在纔知道這是像買一張香檳票想拿進四十二萬，五十萬那般的空想。校對如果只注重書中的意義，而不注意湊成這意義的一個一個單字，那未，我相信出版之後一定錯字累累，而要遭受書店老板或報館主筆的白眼了。總編輯的職務是從全書的觀點上和題材上定取捨（接受或是退還）；編輯的職務是在每段和每句上定取捨（修改）：至的校對的職務是在每個單定上定取捨。因爲職務的不同，致注意力的集中點也各各不同。校對只注意於每個字如：「裏」和「裹」的不同，「已」和「巳」的不同，「綱」和「網」的不同，以及「逈」和「迴」的不同等等，試問對於這每個字的注意能增進智識嗎？那正是和盲人象的笑話一樣。</p>
<p>那末，我在這項工作上實際上獲得些什麽呢？有的，那就是「我賣掉了我的眼睛」，而其代價則不過月薪十餘元而已丨</p>
<p>我當校對還不到一年，我就換了一副比前加深一百度的近視眼鏡，到現在我已不能看淸楚ＸＸ里ＸＸ坊的金字了。這不僅我一個人爲然·我的同事們没有一個不明顯的覺得的。爲了這個，我們也曾想過不少補救的方法，如電燈上用綠紗罩，呌印刷所把校樣反面打（即油光紙的粗糙面）等等。但雖然如此，賣眼睛却還是一樣，只不過是五十步和百步的分别罷了。</p>

<p>粉線是劃好了。老王和老張便面對面的立着，每個人手裏拿着一把網拍。他們開始拍球了，迅捷地拍着，看誰本領好。球在網上跳來跳去，網拍同它相擊着，發出淸脆的聲音。</p>
<p>他，挺直地站在旁邊，像木頭一般。突然，當他没有提防的時候，他的頭上着了一球。球很重，打得他額角上起了個　票，麻辣辣的疼。他不曾呌喊，因　爲呌喊是毫没有用處的。</p>
<p>「你就不能當心一點嗎？」老王對他說，「蠢東西丨」</p>
<p>老張把肩頭聳了兩聳，微笑着。</p>
<p>他們又繼續拍球了。像攻擊敵人似的，他們咬着牙齒，使出渾身氣力，拚命地亂拍，球便像槍彈似的飛了出去。</p>
<p>於是他丨那孩子丨也就很快的拔起腿來奔，腿和臂像生了翅膀似的。奔了幾十步，抓住那堅實的球，用力抛遇來，在他已是使盡了氣力，但球還是丢不到塲子裏。</p>
<p>「吃飯没有？這樣没氣力！」</p>
<p>有時，他們輕輕一拍，球没過網，而降落在他們面前。爲避免球打頭起見，這孩子不敢走進場子一步。於是，他們又發怒了：「不來拾球，等什麽吧！」</p>
<p>球總是那麽捉摸不定的一會兒向東，一會兒同西，他也就脚不停的跟着它奔，正像球上有根毽子牽着他似的。奔得汗淋淋的濕透衣裳了，他還是不住的奔。</p>
<p>太陽高高地掛在頭上，老王和老張早喝過五瓶汽水。</p>
<p>他喘息着，在炎熱的日光下，他覺得兩腿沉重起來，像是綁上了兩塊鉛餅。他木然地站着，渾身疲軟得幾乎癱下來。</p>
<p>可是老王和老張都笑嘻嘻的。若無其事的在繼續拍他們的球，還是用那粗暴的聲調呌喊：「小鬼，快點去拾球丨」</p>

<h3>對於紗廠减工問題的總檢討</h3>
<p>— 張雲士</p>
<p>在目前，中國政治經濟上的嚴重問題除了日本帝國主義如瘋如狂的侵略而外，要算最近全國紗廠之實行滅工了。日本帝國主義的侵路足以傾覆整個民族的生命，而紗廠減工又是民族工業澈底破產的最顯著的明證。</p>
<p>在全國紗廠實行減工的暴風雨中，我們可以聽到三種不同的呼聲。一種是站在資本家的立塲之上，說廠方減工乃是不得已的辦法。際此棉紗生產過剩的局勢下，廠方如果不及時減工，勢將完全破產，那時工人們將連半點工也找不到，正所謂「皮之不存，毛將焉附？」所以目前紗廠資本家的實行減工，一方面果然爲了自已的利益，但一方面却還是爲工人設想。一種是站在工人利益之上，說在這國民經濟破產，失業繁多的時候，工人原來的工資已不敷生活，現在還要減少工作（實際上是減少工資），無異置工人於死地，所以紗廠資本家不應該單顧自已利益，實行減工。另一種便是介乎兩者之間的第三者的說法，在第三者的意見，以爲紗廠資本家的減工乃是出於不得已，而工人的反對，也有一半眞理。不過最好的辦法，在這國勢瀕於危殆之秋，做工人的總要鑒諒資本家的苦衷，暫時吃苦一下，努力生產，以救中國，將來國難變做國慶，全國紗廠的基礎鞏固了，就可以改善工人的生活。其實，依我之見，這三種說法除了工人方面是寳情而外，其餘的無非是些「隔靴搔癢」，不論理論或實際，都有欠妥的地方。</p>
<p>我們曉得中國工人丨尤其是紗廠工人是最苦不過的。工作時間特别長，工資却特别微薄，微薄到簡直不能維持生活，這是盡人皆知的事實。現在因爲棉紗的生產過剩和市塲縮小而減工，其所得的結果當然是把全中國的紗廠工人一個個活活餓死。單這一點，紗廠資本家和政府是没有方法可以替自已辯護的。所以無論如何，紗廠資本家决不該因一時的困難而置工人生活於度外。</p>
<p>反過來說，幼稚的中國工業，在目前確是已到了山窮水盡的時候，亟須設法加於挽救。然而在設法挽救之先，必須了解牠的根本原因，才算對症下藥，發生效果。不然，因噎廢食，終非道理，甚至足以加重國内一切恐慌和混亂的嚴重性。紗廠減工正是這種現象。</p>
<p>中國工業之不能發達，反而日漸衰落，這裏唯一的原因便是受了帝國主義者的侵略。關稅的不能自主，租界的無法收回，便招引來了外貨傾銷，外資壟斷諸病症。而自「九一八」和「一二八」事發以來，東北四省，先後落入日人之手，淞滬一帶，完全爲日軍的砲火所轟燬，於是接踵而至的又有市場縮小，政局紊亂，經濟破產，失業增加……等足以致命的打擊，中國棉紗之生產過剩，自然在所不免。所以要救濟全國紗廠的大危機，並不在於減少工作，而是應該積極反抗日本帝國主義的侵略以及其他各帝國主義者的壓迫。如果不是那樣，就是把工人的工作和工資減到减無可减，也不能挽救此行將垂斃的運命。奈何目前中國的資本家，並不敢豎起反帝國主義的旗，幟。他們祗會柔馴的屈服在牠們面前，一任其壓迫剝削·一面却反過頭來·拚命的到中國工人頭上去取同他們所蒙受的損失。全國紗廠之實行減工，即是一個最顯明的榜樣。</p>
<p>所以我們倘然站在整個民族利益的立塲上，對於紗廠减工，應該無條件的反對。因爲這種减工决不能救濟全國紗廠的危足以置無數工人於死地。要解救紗廠的危機，祇有解放中國，反過來說，祗有中國解放了，纔能使中國的棉織工業以及其他諸工業不至於宣告破產。</p>

<h3>關於「提倡國貨」和「勞資協調」</h3>
<p>— 討論者議員何行修</p>
<p>丨紗廠減工工友生活應如何維持案第四次討論丨</p>
<p>在上期本刋，亦萍君對於這個問題，洋洋灑灑的說了一大套，而歸根結蒂還是不外乎「提倡國貨」和「勞資協作」。</p>
<p>據說中國抵制日貨已有了十二次，當然，跟上來的「提倡國貨」騎馬也有了十二次，然而，結果，日貨遭一次抵制，銷路反旺盛一次；國貨儘管偍倡，却提不上來。這並不是像一般人所說什麽「五分鐘熱度」之類，更不是像亦萍君所說「外貨傾銷」那樣的簡單，問題却在外貨爲什麽會傾銷，而國貨爲什麽提不上來。</p>
<p>資本主義，當其衝入老大的中國的時候　已經是達到了最後的階段，發現了這麽一大塊市塲後即認爲是救命的仙丹。所有資本主義國家均想獨佔，但因爲相互的牽制，纔維持一個「中華民國」的獨立，這樣的一個獨立已經是了不得的天恩，還肯使中國民族資本起來和他們對抗嗎？所以牠們便用了「關稅協定」哪，「大華設立工廠」哪，……許多方法來壓迫中國的新興工業，同時，民族資本家爲了自已的生存，也不得不屈伏投降而去做買辦階級；民族資本根本無建設的可能，「提倡國貨」豈非滑天下之大稽嗎？</p>
<p>至於「勞資合作」「勞資協調」一類的高調，已經是唱過好多年了，然而結果又如何呢？這兩種絕無妥協餘地的敵對勢力展開了血肉的坑爭；所謂「同舟共濟」，：等等，似已成爲有錢的人口中好聽的名詞。因爲亦萍君意識的不正確，所以其所得出的結論，什麽「工商業異常發達，國民生活亦甚活躍，工人生活自然會提高起來，」將戚爲永不能兌現的黄金支票了！</p>
<p>然則，怎樣　是工人的生路呢？據我個人的意見，工友們進有在不妥協的抗爭之前提下始有生路。</p>

<h3>憧憬</h3>
<p>— 羊扶萬</p>
<p>在目前大衆生活的悲慘是無可諱言的事實。我們做店員的能在　有數萬萬失業者的現社會中繼續的維持着自已的職業，似乎可以說是「得天獨厚」了。然而少數人的歡樂，對比出我們生活的艱難；帝國主義者的壓迫和榨取，引起了我們瘦弱的悲感；物質的享受，街市的繁華……在在足以掀動我們的慾念。我們旣不能唯心的說，我們要壓制慾念，而同時又不能用「安身立命」，「與世無爭」的哲學，來安慰我們的心靈。於是我們一部份的人就終日很熱烈地去追求一些不可捉摸的模糊的憧憬，也有的靜候着這些憧憬的到來。但這些憧憬到底是什麽呢？我們所追求着，期待着的到底是什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，我們期待着的是不是「向上」？「向上」就是說，從小夥子會做成大老板，從女工會做成店東主（最近有一張國產影片，是有着這樣的情節，但牠終究是電影），從小學徒會爬到工廠主的地位。過去富豪們的奇贵蹟，不是在啓示我們麽？洗冠生會從小學徒做成大老板，安迪生從小報販做成大資本家，還有許多哈同大來之流的富豪們，不多是「出身微賤」麽？於是有一般會做文章的也就說：「只要能誠誠懇懇，克勤克儉的做下去，没有爬不上頂點的一天」丨丨尤其是在業餘周刋裏面常見有這樣的文章。是的，這些奇蹟倒都是眞的，只可昬牠們已經失掉了「時代」。在資本主義的初期，這些奇蹟是會發生的，而且是應該發生的，但是在現在，資本主義已經老大了，牠已發揮了牠的威權，牠的領域中再也不准有一個下層人可以爬進去。於是，「時代」告訴我們，這樣我期待，是已成了一個無邊的夢想了！</p>
<p>第二，我們就退後一步，不期待這個「向上」，而就期待一個平平」吧，不想成個富翁，而就成個「小康之家」吧。可是資本主義的内在的病症，已經到了不可救藥的地步。羅斯福，麥唐納……還有什麽赫禮歐，希特勒……之類，拚命的想找出一個救也的丹方，而終於無用。什麽倫敦會議，終醫不了這個絕症。生產過剩，購買力低落，工商業衰頽，日子一年年的過去，那資本主義所造成的廣大失業羣，也愈見其廣大。這個「不景氣」的潮流，已經是淹没了整個的世界，未來的失業，不久就要降臨到我們頭上，我們即使想做一個資本主義下「安居樂業」的順民，恐怕也近於不可能的吧。這樣，我們所期待的第二個憧憬，也就成了水中的月亮了丨</p>
<p>所以，我們不能想，想了就要凄然的苦笑了！</p>
<p>未了，我且借一個朋友的話丨他是南京路一家大商店的店員丨來做本文的尾聲吧。他說：「從前我們店裏，在大減價的時候，一天要賣一萬多塊錢，現在呢，能賣一千塊錢就算好的了。而我們店裏的開銷，一天就要七百多。這樣。還能維持下去麽？老板到了這時候，當然有話可說，縮小開支，裁減人員，那我們就只好滚蛋。我個人固然是無望，但其餘大多數的人，又何獨不然呢？</p>
<p>紗廠减工，不是工人也没有生路麽？再看看世界大勢，未來的世界大戰，不是就要爆發了麽？爆發之後。中國當然就成了屠塲，而我們這班人，恐怕就要變成槍下的寃鬼了。我們没有什麽可望了，我們只期待着失業和死亡丨」</p>
<p>但是，我們眞個期待着「失業和死亡」一麽？難道我們不能用自已的力量加速地去剷除那造成我們失業，貧困和死亡的根本原因麽？那或者是一條「生路」呀！</p>
<p>小業餘　警察生活小專号</p>
<h3>剿土匪</h3>
<p>— 柯子祥</p>
<p>公安大職長縣警</p>
<p>警察的生活永久是和枯井一樣的單調而沉悶，尤其是在我們這樣一個寂寞的小縣城裏。可是近來竟然有謠傳，說縣城附近楊家窪出了土匪，而且縣長還發下一道公事到公安局·要我們協同公安大隊尅日將其肅淸。於是我便和其他被派去的弟史以及公安大隊一同辛辛苦苦的到土匪那兒去了。</p>
<p>我們領頭的指揮是公安大隊的隊長，他是眞隸人，大塊頭，專會說大話：他一開口總是：「造你妹子，没有種」。</p>
<p>這次我們看他有種了。他八面威風的領頭走着。不到五里路，我們就坐下來休息，因爲我們要養精畜銳，才有勁兒去打。大隊長精神煥發的向我們宣講，誠懇的敎我們許多不切實用的剿匪戰術。譬如：機關槍要過來就把身體伏下，滚向前去，手溜彈打來不要怕………這許多話我們都聽得厭煩了。末了他忽然激昻的對我們說：「各位弟史們這次一定要代地方上出力，把這班狗土匪結結實實打一頓。」果然我們都興奮起來了，兩條腿躍躍欲試地好像立刻就爬起來才好。患了差不多一刻鐘，我們又上路了。</p>
<p>我們都知道土匪在楊家窪，但是不知道在楊家窪什麽地方。畢竟大隊長足智多謀，他走過一爿茶館面前，立定了，無目標的向裏面喊：「我們是來楊家窪打土匪的，你們有人認得匪窩子麽？立時有個三十來歳的人站起來，一口就說他曉得。我們要他帶路，他答應了，得意的同隊長並排走着。</p>
<p>隊伍沿着一帶土崗前進。初秋的太陽不減署天的酷熱。我們滿身是汗，埋怨地走着。每個人都忘記了向前走的目的，迷茫地像是向一個夢境裏走去。</p>
<p>當我們正在半沉睡狀態的時候，突然有一個極大響聲從左面樹林子裏爆發出來，好像一個巨大的錘子敲在森桶上一樣：這無疑的是槍聲了。野兎似的，我們四面亂竄。大隊長呢，他却老早死牛一般的躺在地上，側着臉對我們大駡：「造你妹子，快爬下來！」我們便莫名其妙的集攏來爬下了。奇怪的是那個領路的鄉下人，他却毫不吃驚的站着，仍然帶着蠢笨的微笑。雖然躺在他身旁的大隊長盡力用拳頭敲他的腿，呌他睡下去，他還是頑固地立着。幾分鐘過了，四週依然寂靜。鄉下人等得不耐煩了，催我們快走。膽大的先立起來，向四面望望，却並不見有槍彈飛來，便失望的招呼大家。於是都站起來互相追問着槍聲的來源。那個鄉下人忽然平淡無奇地說：「這是打槍的（就是打獵的）放的。」</p>
<p>我們不聲不響的又走了幾里，嚮導說老窩子快到了，祇要轉過這座樹林就可以看見了。轉過樹林，果然在土山下面，有五六間草屋：想不想這很平凡的幾間小屋子裏面，却會埋伏着大夥的强人。於是隊伍便不約而同的停了下來。大隊長呌那個鄉下人先去看看，看裏面有多少土匪，在那裏幹些什麽。但鄉下人不　走，他說：「老爺，他們有傢伙哩。」隊長乃回過頭來向着我們：「弟兄們中間誰去看看？」可是也没有一個人答應。「造你妹子，没有種。」又是隊長的聲音，「開槍丨照那兒打丨」大家便伏在地上認定那幾間不聲不響的革屋開槍。不到三四十響，裏面就跑出七八個男女，倉惶的沿着山脚逃去，並没有槍彈向我們飛過來。逃亡者的中間一個倒下了，另一個心亂地來扶他，我們一個衛鋒，把兩個人都抓住了。</p>
<p>我們是得勝了。分内的。我們到鄰村去吃一頓。飯後我和一個老太婆閒談，我說：「我們已給你們把土匪捉住，以後想没有人再來騷擾你們了。」可是她却滿不高興的說：「土匪，土匪不過吃我們的小雞，你們城裏的老爺連我們的雞屎都要吃掉的。土匪倒没本事捉，却把好好的老百姓綑起來了。」但我却始終不相信她的話。我們吃了許多辛苦，受了許多驚嚇，開了許多槍，還會弄錯麽？而且我們是來打土匪，這人不正是我們所打傷的麽？</p>
<h3>冷了的心</h3>
<p>— 王者相</p>
<p>從軍人到警察</p>
<p>我們派出所的午飯時間是在上午十點鐘。飯是由所裏包，菜却要自已買。我們總是：豆腐，鹽菜，乾子，東洋魚，顚來倒去的吃：再好，那裏有錢呢？</p>
<p>有一天飯後，我同一位弟兄！那個山東停子閒談，知道他以前是一個軍人，曾參加國民革命軍北代，打到濟南夾頭挨了東洋矮子一傢伙。後來，不知怎的，長官對他們說：「現在革命成功了，你們走吧！」發給每個人幾塊大洋，散夥了。他便飄蕩蕩地到了這裏來當警察。起初，他還希望慢慢地升上去，可是，幾年來，他仍舊依然故我。他常常夢想回家鄉去，但是，每月十一塊錢的餉，還要扣去四塊錢伙食，自已買菜，洗澡，剃頭，洗衣服，……而且有兩個月没有發餉；命運像鐵釘一樣的把他釘牢在「不幸」上面，生命的前途絕望了！</p>
<p>他同我談起家鄉的風景，談起他的家庭丨還在地主的恩惠之下苟延殘喘地生存着；他靜默了。我知道：在遼遠的天的一隅，在他的靈魂的一角，那兒有白髮蒼蒼的慈母，形容枯槁的孩子：還有：明媚的山林是多麽可愛！故域的憧憬使他心碎，悲哀佔據着他的心了。</p>
<p>至於我自已吧，我是和他同命運的。我每想起月餉十一元，扣去四元伙食，菜錢，理　，洗　，洗衣服……我的心也冷了。</p>

<h3>滴水未進</h3>
<p>— 流浪人</p>
<p>語有云：「一日之計在於晨。一年之計在於春，」那未，「星期一」在我們貴國人看來，當然也可算是一週間的一個有作爲的日子了。</p>
<p>春季已平庸的過去，早晨也不希奇的，在每天的鞋底和路面相擦中溜走；只有「星期一」倒不平常，且比諸其他各日，含有較多的痛苦的成分。</p>
<p>在他人看來，春季和早晨是否平庸，恕我不得而知！不過像那些平庸痛苦等等，只是我個人的感覺罷了！</p>
<p>我是一個曾在某行謀生活，有高中程度的二十一歲的靑年職員，不幸因牠的倒閉，我就跟着失了將近一年的業。可是還有某種原因的存在，使我必須冒充爲社會上生產的一員；於是每天從被裏出來就得跑到馬路上閒逛，去消磨可寳貴丨但已不怎樣可寳貴了丨的早晨光陰，中午光陰，……，黄昏時候，我這游浪的人兒才算挨過了一天。晚上，倒在订上思索起來，覺得自已眞有些像「有家歸不得」的被難同胞那樣的又疲倦，又苦痛。社會呀！我又感到有力賣勿出的苦悶！</p>
<p>不久以前我才發現本市幾個公開的圖書館，其中還是西門的比較合我味兒，下午間或也繞個道兒走到流通圖書館借機本書出來看：還有XX會的，聽說藏書很富、但我被一位比朝奉還要冷十分的格外官僚化者駭得不敢作第二次的拜訪了。幸而前兩個已很夠滿足我的讀書慾和消磨我苦痛的光陰，而我流浪的生活也算告了一個小小的段落，苦痛也比較的減輕了一些。但出賣勞動力的問題，還是如前存在，不曾解决：生活當然仍舊是苦得不堪！</p>
<p>最使我感到苦痛的日子就是每週的「星期一」了。這天，各處竟總同盟的對我們這些「非資本家」實行了罷工；一早我又開始在靜安寺路上流浪，只好信步走去。要說目的地吧，可憐，一些也没有！心裏只是感到人們的可惡，爲何不在馬路上安放些長凳兒，好讓我走脚的休息休息！</p>
<p>昔日所看的街面，仍舊在眼中梳過。謝天謝地！總算走到了黄浦碼頭。以往常的經騐，知道那兒有江有水，還有給人休息的長凳，那兒也是比較容易消磨光陰叩可以使我暫時忘却痛苦的一個所在。</p>
<p>今天已轉到夏季的氣候，無情的暴日緊迫着流人的頭，身，心，……宇宙問一線和平的風絲兒也没有。這時碼頭上少數的長凳，已爲捷足的同志們先得；同時自已脚兒宣佈要休息，神經系通電報告腸胃空虚。呀！海關大鐘已敲過十一點鐘，今天還滴水未進呢！平時還有讀書慾可以戰勝食悉，然而在今天星期一的這種特殊情形之一　食慾又要　當的反　了。</p>
<p>唉！來日方長，前途眞是茫茫。最後想想，還是去告報（？）狀，請求社會上的先生們來援助我一二；事務不論鉅細，只要有個位置就是了！</p>

<h3>小覇王愛德華魯濱蓀</h3>
<p>— 横</p>
<p>專扮流氓角色的明星</p>
<p>確是溫文爾雅的君子</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱蓀在「小霸王」問世以後，就轟動整個的銀壇。從此他就像注定似的專門表演這種「吃力」的角色丨最主要的就是强盜流氓等丨。他對這種角色演來非常深刻動人，因爲他不僅僅是超等的流氓演員，而是個偉大的天才演員。人家都以爲他演這種壞角，品性一定是相近的，其實他的爲人恰恰完全和銀幕上所演的相反。他是個溫文爾雅的君子，他那在銀幕上的黑眼所放射出來的兇光可以使觀衆嚇得毛管竪起，可是平時却全然不這樣的。在攝影塲裏，他是以善於憂慮著名的。他所憂慮的並不是無理的。他是爲着他工作的完美起見而然的。你看他憂慮着他下一部戲的故事，演員的分配·服裝·佈影等丨其他切他都憂慮着的。</p>
<p>在還没有獻身銀幕以前，他就已經是美國著名的「紅」伶了，現在當然更不用說了。他從前在哥倫比亞大學的戲劇學院研究戲劇藝術，後來就得到該校文學碩士的學位。他在美國戲劇權威的紐約戲院公會裏，亦佔着重要地位，他並且擅長各種外國語言，曾出演於幾家外國語戲院。他在舞臺上十六年之中，已演過不少有名的舞臺劇。雖然「小霸王」是他給電影觀衆深刻地認識他的藝術，可是他還有許多聲片的作品像「號外新聞」，「兩分鐘」等？就是在默片他也曾經演過不少的片子。如「伶俐的女郎」是和李察白特墨斯合作的「戀人」是和彭開合作的，在這部戲裏面他是飾一個農夫，表演的有力動人，實在令人驚嘆。其實他對每部戲都是一樣地認眞努力，這在我們看他的片子時都可以得到證明。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「春水情波」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>意識頗好　演出甚佳</p>
<p>明星公司不可多得的出品</p>
<p>前言「中國電影的確進步了。」當我看完「春水情波」之後，我不由的這樣肯定了一句。</p>
<p>無論如何，在歐美電影在中國電影市塲佔着絕對優勢的情景之下，中國的電影製作家能夠如此抖擻精神改善自身的作品，的確是非常可驚的，特别是電影藝術家在意識上有了極大的轉變，這使我們對於中國的電影文化前途，多少總有點樂觀的憧，雖然這還需要我們觀衆堅强而有力的扶植。</p>
<p>以上當然不是題外的廢話。</p>
<p>鄭正秋的三反主義　假如我們不敢忽視任何導演的「意持沃羅基」那末上了年紀的鄭正秋先生，能夠有這樣極大的轉變，確是値得我們欽偑的。他在畫面中很明顯的揭穿了中國官塲賣官嚮爵的黑幕，他在字幕上詼諧而沉痛的痛駡了這些醜態。他詆斥了那般自美國鍍金回來的少爺們的兒戲愛情，說明了現實社會的「愛」的虚僞。（雖然在最後還給了他一個懺悔的機會。）他說明了不同貧富的人們在愛情上的衝突。他反的封建勢力在鄉村中的暴戾，以及宗法社會的不合理。他憤恨帝國主義在半殖民地中國的暴行。但是他結果却没有堅强的反抗起來，祗是消極的退避到西北去開墾「新的天地」，以及還迷惑着「慈善」能拯救貧苦的大衆。當然，「」新天地决不會在雙重的壓迫这下創造出來，同時「慈善」這個東西也早也不夠麻醉。然而無論如何，他自已所極力主張的「三反主義」，究竟在這裏一般的表現出來，至少他已認識了帝國主義，封建勢力……等等在中國的毒害。當然我們不必苛求，所以總可以相當滿足。</p>
<p>進步的演出技巧　其次我們對於他的導演技巧，也是値得注意的。他將故事一點不煩亂的叙述下去，雖然他將重心着重在愛情方面，但是他却不肯放鬆所必須暴露的各點。因爲是描寫愛情的原故，所以他使劇的情調能夠柔和。對於鏡頭也很注意。尤其是那游湖的旋轉的「長鏡頭」更見活潑，可是因爲是外景而光線不充分的關係，還不夠美。然而幾個「大寫」都是很精采的。但是比較更好的還是情感方面。他使每個觀衆都能同情阿毛，能夠爲她傷感，這在悲劇方面是很成功的。可是他將毛少爺却寫得還不夠「坯」，還不使我們十分討厭他，特别是讓他懺悔起來，這一點是缺乏「反襯」力量的，不過我們也不能忽視他是一個隨波逐流的人物。還有一點，便是對於演員脚色的支配，還不適當，嚴月嫺就不如飾寒瓊來得恰合。總之，關於演出，鄭正秋先生也總算盡了責任的</p>
<p>表演的檢討　至於表演，那末胡蝶又是相當成功的。她全部都是那樣認眞而自然，一點也不勉强。那的痛苦，她的淚水，無疑義是很深刻而動人的。然面在最後當毛少爺給錢的時候，她也是那樣試懇，這一點是導演的忽視，也可知她不夠堅强和力的表現。王獻齋又是成功的一個。譚志遠比以前略進步。胡萍不合個性。嚴月嫺還認眞，傳憶秋可以，李君磬和徐莘園平平。顧蘭君不及在「前程」中來得自然。至於主角孫敏却未見成功，一個鍍金過的留學生决不僅僅是溫柔儒雅。而且官前與官後也没有一點變換。然而少爺的身份，總算相當的表現出來。</p>
<p>尾聲　關於其他各點，我覺得字幕很生動，但放映的時間大短，有的簡直讀不完全。攝影佈景都不壞。</p>
<p>總之，我以爲這是明星公司很成熟的作品，在中國的默片中自然是不可多得。大槪關心中國電影的人們，雖然不會十分滿足，但也不致於何等失望吧。最後我敬祝本片的作者諸君努力！</p>

<h3>「無家者的印象」</h3>
<p>— 之中</p>
<p>從封建階級造成的洪水線和帝國主義血腥的鐵蹄線下面逃亡到另一條飢餓線上的人們，同是無家可歸的漂泊者，另一方面是受着帝國主義庇蔭的都市中資本家少奶奶給厭故喜新的公子遺棄了，也同樣的流落徘徨在十字街頭。事實敎育他成她們，丨要生存，止有集中力量奮鬥丨</p>
<p>這種現實的題材，銀幕上也曾見了不少，可是都是各别的或曲解的。祇有藝華公司的處女作丨「無家者」把這三種典型丨洪水線，鐵蹄線，几被遺棄的人們的感情嚴密地組織起來正確地向奮鬥的險道上出發。這是一闋八音蟬聯的交響曲，這是一幅逼肖中國的寫生畫。</p>
<p>日前爲本片試演之期，在一間權作戲院的辦公室裏，畫面就在淡綠色的夾板上展開了，編劇而兼導演的陳瑜君在快口逐幕的解釋劇情，（因爲還没有字幕）直至鐘鳴十下，我們方才出塲。</p>
<p>本片給我的印象；是打破了主角配角的舊習，（就劇情的發展過程上說）使整個劇情，有力地分布在每個演員的身上，這兒使用了新的Montoge，丨連塲雪景，每個被壓迫者都興奮地在集團意志上開拓他們的前路；這兒没有受人捧過的明星，丨都是初上鏡頭的演員，但們却都是黑暗深處的明燈；光線明暗他，適合其度，這不能不敬偑Camera　Man的手校高妙了。</p>
<h3>小妹將主演「小妹妹」</h3>
<p>— 眉公</p>
<p>外加一羣聰明美麗的小妹妹</p>
<p>現在的電影明星，彷彿梁山泊的人物，名字上面多頂着一個綽號，例如：儉約明星陳玉梅，野攻瑰王人美，甜姐兒黎莉莉，小女伶袁美雲……等。尤其著名的，要算小妹妹黎明暉。她寫信常常不署名，只寫「小妹妹」三字，可見她自已也很愛這個綽號，但她的年齡，已是一位大妹妹，只是她情性，依然是天眞爛漫，嬌活潑·不改小妹妹的本色。</p>
<p>她去年從香港回到上海，重入電影界，在天一公司主演有聲影片「追求，」公映公後，觀衆們對於這位久離銀幕的小妹妹，發生更深的好感，原因是因爲她没有失掉五六年前的活潑天眞的小妹妹的風格。</p>
<p>她見天一公司中有不少聰明美麗的小妹妹，像袁美雲·邵素霞·陳綺霞·陳竸芳等，都是十五六歳的小姑娘，而且都有表演天才·如果能夠集合這班小女星來合演一部戲，一定可以得到美滿的成功。她屢次要求邵醉翁·要和這羣小妹妹合演一部影片，邵醉翁對這個提議，很是贊成，預備專爲她門編一劇本。片名就呌「小妹妹，」劇情大槪是含有敎育意　的家庭劇，由小妹妹主演，袁美雲，邵素霞，陳綺霞，陳競芳，等加入合演。一俟劇本編就，即可開拍，小妹妹主演「小妹妹，」可說是一件極有興味的事。</p>
<h3>天一賽球的新計劃</h3>
<p>— 潔冰</p>
<p>邵醉翁率領下之天一足球隊，自經成立以來，全體隊員，早夕練習，矢忠矢勇·一星期前，天一發出戰書，函約新聞報部際隊在中華足球場嘗試破題兒的處女友誼賽，詎因是日球迷過多，幾至塲無隙地，不得已臨時停賽，相約改期而罷，惟雙方健兒，雄心不死，必欲一决雌雄，新聞報曾籌劃再三，擬具計劃二則，徵求天一同意，一·臨時秘密舉賽，避免外界注意·二·戰場假座逸園，發售門券，所得售資，悉數充作「航空救國」捐，惟聞雙方現正詳加考慮，尙未正式决定，不知此一幕滑稽球賽，究竟於何日才得開演於春申江也。</p>
<h3>蘇俄電影槪况（一）　魯道夫梅蘇氏著</h3>
<p>— 抱寒</p>
<p>編者引：去年七八月之間，英國社會黨組織有名紐費賓研究社者（New　FabianResearchBureau），發起蘇俄旅行調者團，延聘專家考察蘇俄實况，以科學專門的眼光，記裁蘇維埃革新後國家社會各項事業之實在情形。事先各專家在英倫　本國曾有長時間之籌備與探討，俾於旅蘇抵境之後，卽從事於各個選定問題範圍内之考查及搜尋。結果成爲極有價値之專家論文十二章，合訂一書名「蘇俄研究十二種」（Twelve　Studies　in　Soviet　Russia）。其中雖有因專家敎人阻於他事，未能加入調查，致如蘇俄近代之醫學衛生方面之設備，以及運輸統系之概况等示能一併列入書内。但其他一切政治，經濟，工，農，實業，婦女，兒童，建設，市政，文化事業等等，已應有盡有，此外與本刋有重要深切之關係者有「蘇俄電影」一文（The　Film　In　Russia）係魯道夫墨索爾Rudolph　Messel氏著。茲特請抱寒君譯出以饗愛護本刋之閱者。再則此書出版未久，原書到滬者，爲數甚　，故内容價値亦彌足珍視也。</p>
<p>（一）蘇俄對於電影之理想</p>
<p>吾人居於歐洲者，對於戲劇與電影大都俱已爲先入之成見所控制。吾人視此二種表演之形式，一則認其爲運用某人，或某人之藝術天性途徑之一種，二則認爲吾人日常娱樂之所必需。今欲了解蘇俄國内戲劇或電影之實况，第一先須積極排去吾人已具之成見。吾人不須先有虚懷若谷之心胸，始可從事於該問題之接近，再則，尤爲重要者，吾人平日所認爲絕對的不變的事物，在蘇俄人手中，忽易而非絕對的，可變的。此時吾人應竭力避免各種失望，幻滅，或竟絕望。倘吾人能以此種精神研究本題，自然至少可得一明白之視察，或竟能明瞭；但倘不以此種精神而貿貿然跨入此是非之場，實絕無視察何種重要事物之可能，當然尤無明解之希望矣。</p>
<p>在歐洲及美國，吾人確然認電影及戲院所以存在的最大之理由爲吾人自命爲觀衆之一部份，即有被娛之需要。吾人之具有此種見解，無論其是或非，此戲俱無加以辯論之必要。但此處必須指明此係資本主義世界所具有之見解，惟同時亦必須指明此種見解在蘇聯境内，實已無影踪之可　。（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Declares Ceasefire is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 4:45 PM on the 27th, the Army authorities announced that the Chinese and Japanese armies are conducting ceasefire negotiations. (Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry announced that the Japanese army's re-deployment to within the passes is primarily to eliminate the base of operations for Chinese challenges and has no intention of conquering the Pingjin area. From Japan's statement, it is clear that occupying Pingjin is within the army's capability, so the reason for not occupying Pingjin is this. For the past two or three days, it has been rumored that ceasefire negotiations have begun between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Beiping, but this has only progressed to the point of preparing to initiate negotiations. Japan's objective is to ensure the security of the Manchurian border, not to continue fighting. Therefore, it would be best for the Chinese side to approach the negotiations with sincerity and reach an agreement. However, the outcome of the negotiations depends on China's attitude. Judging from the past, the road ahead is fraught with difficulties. Preparations are being made on the ground for both peaceful negotiations and war. If negotiations fail due to China's lack of sincerity or if challenging actions lead to renewed fighting, the impact would be significant. The Chinese authorities must fully consider this.

<h3>Only Might, No Justice</h3>
<p>The German Newspaper's Commentary is Worth Heeding</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Deutsche Tageszeitung's editorial today stated that Japan will certainly achieve its demands on China. This is a milestone in history and may mark a new era in world history. Regardless of who is right or wrong in East Asia, the fact remains that the strong prey on the weak and might prevails. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Moscow Newspaper Comments on the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The "Pravda" published an article on the situation in North China, stating that the fate of Pingjin has long been determined. These two major cities are now under the control of Japanese military power. Regarding the Japanese army's advance into Chahar, the newspaper said that the Japanese army not only wants to control North China but also has its sights on Outer Mongolia. As for its advance on Pingjin, it is aimed at realizing its long-held ambition of dominating Shandong. The newspaper concluded that the seizure of Pingjin is even more important than Manchuria and Jehol because it will bring Japanese imperialism into conflict with the interests of the great powers, especially the United States and Britain. Although there is a tacit understanding between Britain and Japan against the United States, the Japanese army's occupation of North China will inevitably greatly intensify the US-Japanese relationship and unfold a new chapter in the imperialist struggle for hegemony in the Pacific.

<p>(Hong Kong) The 2,232-ton steamer Prowess was recently robbed near Hong Kong. The captain was injured. A police boat went to help and chased the pirates, but it was too late. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Prowess steamer was robbed near Hong Kong yesterday. Captain Ren Sen was injured for resisting the robbers. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong this morning, it was reported that he awoke at 2:00 AM yesterday and saw the first mate and five pirates fighting in the wheelhouse. He went to help but was shot twice by the pirates. He was then subdued, thrown below deck. Last night at 11:00 PM, an armed launch chased the ship. The pirates threatened to set the ship on fire if the launch persisted. The police boat followed until 5:00 AM, when the Prowess stopped in Hasha, Dong Au Bay. The police boat then opened fire. It was later learned that the first and second mates were being held hostage as shields, so the firing stopped. The pirates abandoned the ship and fled. When the pirates' boat reached the shore, the police boat opened machine gun fire again. The result is unknown. It is reported that the police boat fired three-pound guns several times to stop the Prowess from advancing and requested assistance from the navy. The British destroyer HMS Whitehead rushed to the rescue from Dapeng Bay, but the pirates had already escaped. It is rumored that the warship has sent a company of soldiers ashore to pursue the pirates, but this has not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>The Tianjin Plainclothes Troops Mutinied Again and Failed. More Than Twenty People Were Captured by the Security Forces.</h3>
<p>Ma Tingfu and An Fukui Fled on a Japanese Ship</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The plainclothes troops in the Japanese Concession were each paid five yuan and four rows of bullets on the evening of the 26th. They were commanded by Zhang Bi, the commander of the puppet Provisional First Division. At 1:00 AM on the 27th, plainclothes troops were discovered in the Sifeng Cemetery outside Xiyingmen and were repelled. At 3:00 AM, more than 20 plainclothes troops were discovered near the Tianjin-Pukou West Station and fired fifty or sixty shots, but they were also repelled. Our security forces took advantage of the lifting of the curfew at dawn to conduct a large-scale search and captured several people. At 10:00 AM, when our security forces patrolled Sanyizhuang, Zhejiang Yiyuan, in Special District 1, they discovered a paper-wrapped Five-Color Flag next to a gourd-shaped bomb, which fortunately did not explode. On the evening of the 27th, approximately 200 armed Japanese soldiers arrived at Jieffang, Luowa, and Zhangzhuang. A vendor went to sell food and discovered that they were disguised puppet troops.

<h3>Japan's Aggression Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>China Cannot Disarm</p>
<p>China's Long Coastline Without a Navy Constantly Suffers Military Aggression. The Conflict Between China and Japan Is Unresolved. Not Accepting Any Restrictions.</p>
<p>Representative Gu Reiterates Stand on Disarmament</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Representative Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a statement to the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference today, stating that although China has a long coastline, it effectively has no navy. Its adjacent territorial waters are constantly subjected to armed aggression by the sea and land forces of an aggressive nation, violating international conventions. Therefore, the Chinese government cannot accept any restrictions to limit China's right to implement all necessary plans to resist aggression and protect its territorial sovereignty until China's interests have been served and the current war of aggression against China has been finally resolved. Dr. Gu also stated that this is China's most painful situation. China's traditional love of peace and its firm belief in the peaceful resolution of international disputes have not been reciprocated. This is all the more regrettable. This reservation is not a new position. It can be clearly seen in the general reservations made by the Chinese delegation in July 1932. Furthermore, this action is fully in line with the spirit of Article 28 of the British draft treaty. This is merely a reiteration that the general reservation applies to the navy, just as it applies to the army and air force. China's previous reservation was made by Dr. Yan Huiqing on July 23 of that year after the General Committee passed a resolution prohibiting aerial bombardment, chemical, incendiary, and bacteriological warfare, limiting the caliber of land artillery and the weight of tanks, and approving the establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Committee. At that time, Dr. Yan stated that he supported the resolution, but China could not undertake disarmament until the dispute between China and Japan was resolved. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>After Germany Softens, Japan Becomes Stubborn Again</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Demands Naval Equality</p>
<p>Obstructing the Establishment of a Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>The Farce of Arms Expansion in the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Naval Issues Negotiated Outside the Conference</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Japan threatened to obstruct unanimous agreement on a disarmament convention, demanding that the wording of the draft convention allow Japan to achieve a more favorable position regarding naval ratios. After seeing that his proposal to negotiate a new naval agreement was not supported by other countries, Japanese representative Sato declared to the General Committee that Japan's participation in any convention would depend on whether the convention could avoid mentioning the Washington and London Treaties. He clearly indicated that Japan was seeking a better naval position, namely, although it could not achieve actual equality with Britain and the United States, it must greatly increase its ratio. He also said that Japan insisted that the new disarmament convention must stipulate adherence to the principles proposed by Japan last December in order to negotiate a new naval agreement. According to Japan's proposal, Britain and the United States would have to reduce their naval power, while Japan would be allowed to build new ships, which is certainly not something the major powers could agree to. It is also heard that the major powers are opposed to discussing naval strength again before the expiration of the London Naval Treaty. However, Japan is now trying to find an opportunity to force countries to negotiate a tonnage agreement that is more beneficial to it and is expected to insist on this position until it obtains some concessions. (Kokusai News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The naval proposals in the British-drafted disarmament convention continued to be criticized today. The Japanese representative submitted an amendment to delete Article 3, stating that Articles 24 to 28 should be negotiated separately and hinting that Japan intended not to sign the disarmament convention if the Japanese amendment was rejected. The Chinese delegation announced China's reservation of the right to self-defense, and representatives of small countries also proposed several amendments that would weaken the advantages of the naval powers. In his response, British representative Eden solemnly stated that Britain had already reduced its naval armaments by half and was now only asking small countries to maintain the current rates. Eden also suggested holding talks with the various delegations in order to accommodate the opinions of the smaller countries, and the representatives who proposed the amendments all supported this proposal. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Ministry officials stated that Representative Sato's disarmament speech in Geneva, in addition to explicitly stating that the London Treaty expires at the end of 1936, also hinted at the following principles for Japan at the 1935 Disarmament Conference: Because the area the Imperial government defends has increased according to the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, it is necessary to seek a revision to expand naval strength. This is not only a revision of the London Treaty but a demand to confirm the principle of equal rights to armaments among major countries, to recognize the principle of racial equality at the same time as implementing disarmament, which is effective for world peace, and to recognize that the establishment of gentlemen's agreements or mutual agreements or the promotion of arbitration treaties among major countries is effective for eliminating international disputes. (Dentsu telegraph on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet representative Dovgalevsky criticized the naval portion of the British disarmament plan today at the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, stating that the implications of this part of the plan are diametrically opposed to the views advocated by the Soviet delegation. The plan not only seeks to recognize the obvious inequality between a few major naval powers and many small naval powers but also to increase it, because if the plan were implemented, the naval development of countries that have not signed the Washington and London Agreements would be restricted, while the signatories would still be able to continue increasing their navies. Dovgalevsky continued by saying that the Soviet Union only hopes for the realization of disarmament based on the principle of equal vessels, and also said that the Soviet delegation does not wish to propose any amendments to this British plan because the plan neither stipulates a reduction in existing naval tonnage nor seeks to secure benefits exceeding those of other countries for a few major naval powers, which the Soviet Union cannot accept. The Soviet delegation also opposes the major naval powers including ships that are not yet built, or even only in the planning or drafting stage, in the calculation of existing tonnage. In addition, the Soviet delegation further opposes the major naval powers having exceptions to the restrictions on the construction of warships of all classes stipulated in the Washington and London Agreements, while not allowing other countries to have the same exceptions, and also opposes non-signatories to the Washington and London Agreements being unable to replace one type of warship with another within the prescribed tonnage limit.

<h3>Disarmament Conference Begins Discussion of Air Force Issues</h3>
<p>Majority Advocates Abolishing Aerial Bombardment</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference discussed the air force clauses of the British plan this morning. Hungarian representative General Tomcsányi and German representative Nadolny both called for the complete abolition of military aircraft, the prohibition of aerial bombardment, and at the same time, placing the civil aviation industry under international supervision and effective monitoring. The German government believes that this measure is a way to restore mutual trust between nations and ensure equality in armaments. Spanish representative Madariaga supported the abolition of military aircraft and said that the abolition of military aircraft also makes it imperative to internationalize civil aircraft. Soviet representative Stein ridiculed the clause in the British plan allowing aerial bombardment in remote areas. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour agreed with the opinion of the Spanish representative, declaring that France advocates the internationalization of civil aircraft, and if internationalization is not possible, civil aircraft should be placed under permanent international supervision. He also said that France is prepared to accept the abolition of aerial bombardment, to place quantitative and qualitative limits on aircraft, and to gradually reduce air armaments. France is willing to sacrifice military aviation, but only on the condition that other countries make similar sacrifices. This discussion will continue at 3:30 PM this afternoon.

<h3>German Representative Strenuously Advocates Complete Abolition of Aerial Bombardment</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Speaking at the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference today, German representative Nadolny strenuously advocated the complete abolition of military aircraft and aerial bombardment, saying that fourteen years ago, Germany destroyed all of its air force, including 15,700 aircraft, 27,000 engines, and 547 airfields, originally intending this to be the first step towards international disarmament. Today, everyone knows that large air armaments have become decisive tools of victory due to recent inventions. For countries that do not have aerial defenses, there is no need to send a single soldier or a single cannon or warship to attack them. A single squadron of bombers is enough to destroy the country.

<h3>Middle East Railway Situation Increasingly Deteriorating</h3>
<p>Bandit Gangs Collude with Puppet Police to Plunder肆刦</p>
<p>Puppet Regime Demands Restrictions on Russian Personnel's Authority</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to recent news obtained from Boli, the situation on the eastern section of the Middle East Railway is increasingly deteriorating. Bandit gangs often collude with the Manchurian railway police to plunder, even daily. Due to the complete lack of protection, residents of Wuteshimi Station and other places have panicked and fled. On May 20th, a portion of the guard at Hengdaohezi Station mutinied and joined the bandits, plundering near Suchinzhai Station (transliteration). The next day, the bandits opened fire on Maoershan Railway Station, threatening to kidnap all station employees. The railway police at that station also rebelled and fled into the mountains. On the same day, the bandits attacked Taipingling Railway Station and plundered their fill. On May 22nd, a Russian switchman at Xiduonizhai (transliteration) Station was kidnapped by bandits while on duty. Another large group of bandits, approximately 700 people, was discovered between Xilin and Xiaosuifen Stations. The following day, a freight train was robbed and abandoned on the tracks.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Questioning the National Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>Recently, education authorities have advocated for a national graduation examination. The idea is that the examination system embodies Dr. Sun Yat-sen's intention for examinations and is a major policy promulgated by the nation to promote teaching efficiency, select true talent, and raise cultural standards. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, as well as the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, are all preparing to implement it. However, we believe that this proposal is still open to debate.</p>
<p>We are, of course, absolutely in favor of strict education. In the past twenty years, China has lacked a clear educational direction. Today, we imitate the Japanese system, and tomorrow, we copy the superficial aspects of Europe and America, treating education as a trivial matter and using young people as test subjects. Since the September 18th Incident, the decline and laxity in education have continued as before. If we do not rectify this, the future of our nation and people will truly be doomed.</p>
<p>However, strictness should not be limited to examinations alone, especially not to a superficial national examination. The re-establishment of educational principles, the reorganization of educational administration, and even the transformation of the political and social environment are all extremely urgent and important. In other words, strictness should not be limited to the students. Educational authorities and society as a whole should exercise strict self-discipline. The national crisis since September 18th is the result of twenty years of poor politics and education. Therefore, education after September 18th should strive to be different from education before September 18th. This difference does not lie solely with the students, especially not with the national examination. We should focus on extremely strict daily training. Examination results are not necessarily a reliable indicator of educational achievement.</p>
<p>Those who advocate for the national examination today say it will promote teaching efficiency, select true talent, and raise cultural standards. However, based on our observations, we remain doubtful. Teaching efficiency depends on the entire educational system, the entire social environment, and the quality of school authorities, not on a prize-like examination, especially not on a "imperial examination-style" national examination. This is self-evident. If the national examination is meant to rigorously assess students' achievements, then the rigorous examinations within schools should be able to fulfill this task. If the school's examinations are deemed unreliable, how can we entrust the schools with the important responsibility of training and educating young people? If the school authorities are not trusted, how can we trust those who administer the national examination?</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the selection of true talent, so-called "true talent" is not necessarily produced through selection. Moreover, how many of today's administrative officials and educational authorities were actually selected through proper procedures? In recent years, the Examination Yuan has held grand examinations, but many of those who topped the lists have yet to be employed, and some of those who have been employed have been found guilty of corruption. Therefore, the national examination's selection of true talent is not necessarily reliable. As for raising cultural standards, prize-like competition can foster a desire for advancement and increase the pursuit of wealth and power. The evils of the imperial examination era stemmed from this. We dare not believe that it can raise cultural standards.</p>
<p>What is especially worth discussing is that in remote counties and impoverished families, the burden of school fees is already extremely difficult to bear. How can they withstand the added burden of travel expenses? As a result, the national examination will only benefit the children of wealthy families, while those from impoverished families will likely be excluded, which may violate the principles of education.</p>
<p>In short, we are absolutely in favor of strict education today. However, strictness lies in the entire educational policy and the entire educational system, both of which should be re-established. Today is an extraordinary period, and we should have education appropriate for this extraordinary period. We have stated this point before.</p>
<h3>US-Japan Talks Involve Far East Issues</h3>
<p>Roosevelt劝 Advised Japan to Uphold Arms Reduction</p>
<p>Ishii Requests Instructions from the Tokyo Government</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt had a long conversation with Japanese representative Ishii. Roosevelt stated that he was very interested and satisfied with his talks with the Japanese representative, which related to the entire range of world issues. It is reported that the talks took place in a very amicable atmosphere, but the discussion of various world issues was limited to theoretical and general terms. Therefore, the talks did not result in any concrete agreements. When Ishii mentioned "Manchukuo," Roosevelt maintained a general attitude and did not want to engage in concrete discussions. Consequently, the Sino-Japanese issue was not addressed. Ishii plans to meet with Roosevelt again before his departure. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) During last night's conversation between Japanese representative Viscount Ishii and Roosevelt, Roosevelt requested that Ishii relay to the Tokyo government a change in its stance on the arms reduction conference. Ishii agreed to convey this message to Tokyo. Roosevelt stated that he would schedule another meeting with Ishii once the reply from Tokyo reached Washington. The questions raised by the United States will be telegraphed to the Japanese government by the Japanese representative. Tokyo will respond immediately after receiving the telegram. The reply from the Japanese representative arrived around noon today. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the first meeting between the US President and Japanese representative Ishii, according to reports received by the Foreign Ministry, the US President emphasized the necessity of US-Japan cooperation and proposed two points: in order to ensure the success of the economic conference in the short term, he hoped for Japan's maximum support and cooperation; in order to ensure the success of the conference, the agenda should be limited and the agenda items of the preparatory committee should be removed. Although there are no reports yet regarding the progress of the second meeting, it appears to have focused on the issue of arms reduction. Opinions were exchanged on issues such as peace guarantees and the Far East. Judging from the impressions of the first meeting, the US President does not seem to be bound by Hoover's or Stimson's policies. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Important Weapon in Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>The United States Decides to Formally Abandon the Gold Standard - Congress Submits a Bill at the President's Request to Change the Monetary System Basis of the Past Eighty Years - The Purpose of this Move is to Consolidate the Currency with an Artificial Standard to Make it Easier for Debtor Countries to Cope with Debt Repayments</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, the United States will legislate to abandon the gold standard. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, both the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously submitted a bill to abolish the gold standard at the direct request of the US President. The gold standard has been the basis of the American monetary system for nearly 80 years since its adoption in 1853. Although it was abolished twice during the Civil War and in 1893, it was gradually restored. The gold standard law that is now sought to be abolished was re-enacted in 1900, stipulating that the gold dollar should contain 25.8 grains of gold with a fineness of 90 percent, and that all currencies should conform to this standard value, with the Ministry of Finance responsible for maintaining it. If this is passed by Congress and abolished, it means that thereafter, all American currency will no longer be backed by gold, but by the national wealth. Therefore, the nature of this move is not to inflate the currency, but to replace the gold standard with an artificial standard, making all American currency "legal tender." Currently, currencies in the United States, such as silver certificates, national bank notes, Federal Reserve notes, and Federal Reserve bank notes, are commonly used in the market, but in legal terms, they are not "legal tender." When repaying public and private debts, anyone can refuse to accept them and demand payment in gold. This also has no relation to silver. Therefore, the hopes of silver-producing states to re-establish bimetallism have also suffered a serious blow. Senator Fletcher proposed the bill in the Senate today, and Representative Steagall proposed it in the House of Representatives. Steagall explained the effects of the bill: (1) All American currency will henceforth be "legal tender" for the repayment of public and private debts; (2) Foreign war debts owed to the United States will automatically decrease; (3) Banknotes will not need to be redeemed for gold; (4) All future federal government bonds can abolish the gold repayment clause; (5) The government will be able to cope with any international exchange rate situation with ease. Therefore, the purpose of this move is to base the American currency on an artificial standard, so that its value can rise and fall at any time according to international exchange conditions, becoming an important weapon in economic warfare with other countries. Therefore, the leaders of both houses of Congress predict that although this bill will cause the most intense debate in decades, it will ultimately be passed. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Steagall, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, today introduced a bill in the House to abolish the gold standard, stating that after the bill is passed, the United States' debtor countries can repay their war debts in any currency commonly used in the United States. The introduction of this bill was at the request of the US President. Steagall said when introducing the bill that it would allow the United States to escape the obstacles of the gold standard. This proposal, together with the proposals of the administrative authorities, is part of President Roosevelt's emergency relief program. This bill can make it unnecessary for the US President to devalue the gold dollar based on the currency inflation clause of the rural relief law. The public sees this as giving the President absolutely free rein, another step in coping with the World Economic Conference. The State Department is confident that this bill will be passed by Congress, lowering the price of the US dollar in international exchange rates, so that the United States can consolidate its currency with a relatively lower standard. However, New York bankers believe that this bill is merely intended to make the de facto situation conform to the law and to clarify the abnormal situation arising from the current gold clause involving hundreds of billions of US dollars in public and private debt. Treasury Secretary Woodin stated that some people may have doubts about the legal status of debtors and creditors regarding repayment in gold. The purpose of this bill is to eliminate this doubt. The bill will add an amendment to the Rural Relief Act, stating that all coins and currencies already minted or issued in the United States, including Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve Bank and National Banking Association banknotes, are legal tender for the repayment of public and private debts, as well as national and local taxes. After the proposal to repay war debts with paper money was introduced, bonds rose by as much as 1 to 9 British pounds, and gold mine stocks were very popular. Former Treasury Secretary Glass, the originator of the Federal Reserve System, expressed his opinion today, saying that any move to overturn the gold clause contained in the current contracts will be deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the news of the new US bill to abolish the gold standard spread, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar rose by half a British pound today, making 100 Japanese yen worth 24 and 1/16 US dollars. There was no change in the exchange rate against the British pound. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>(London) News from Geneva received this afternoon in London states that the British and French governments have reached a compromise on the wording of the Four-Power Pact. However, Reuters in London learned tonight that although negotiations between the two countries have been ongoing for some time, a compromise has not yet been reached. The previous statement was premature. However, the general public now hopes that a compromise can eventually be reached. People in Geneva now do not believe that Italy and Germany will raise any new issues, so it will not be difficult to reach a compromise once Britain and France compromise. The Little Entente countries seem to have given up their objections to the pact. However, it is reported that Poland still opposes the pact in principle and will not change this attitude even if the pact is within the framework of the League of Nations, because Poland feels that the pact only weakens the power of the League of Nations. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Polish Ambassador to France, Mr. Szura-Bustos, met with Prime Minister Daladier today to discuss the situation of the disarmament negotiations in Geneva and the conversations regarding the Four-Power Pact. In the evening, Prime Minister Daladier also discussed the Four-Power Pact with British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Campbell. France advocates including the sanctions against aggressors stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant in the Four-Power Pact. This was originally opposed by the United Kingdom. The attitude of the British cabinet now seems more favorable. London is now expressing some optimism about the outcome of the Four-Power Pact negotiations. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>More Than 20 Passengers Kidnapped</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The "He Shun" steamer, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, departed from Tianjin for Yingkou on the morning of the 21st.

The leader of the bandits was Chinese, fluent in French and Japanese, and his deputy was also very beautiful, both seemingly educated. The ship was carrying 1,000 refugees from Tianjin. Twenty-one pirates mingled among them. At a signal, the pirates rose up together, and none of the people on board were spared, all being robbed. The safe on the ship was also broken open, and everything was taken. Passing ships were also attacked. They then fled with their loot in shallow waters, also kidnapping several people before leaving. This is truly the most shocking piracy case on the seas of North China. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Both Armies Retreat, Peace in Tianjin (Reached?)</h3>
<p>No Battles Reported on Any Front for Several Days</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: The safety of Pingjin, the focus of all eyes, is now gradually showing a glimmer of hope and should be temporarily worry-free. Our authorities are doing their best to maintain Pingjin. The military meeting at Jurentang on the 22nd showed determination to fight to the last stand. After the Japanese side agreed to further discussions, hope began to emerge after more than ten hours of efforts from the evening of the 22nd to the morning of the 23rd. In the past two days, military operations on the front line, although not completely stopped, have become more and more relaxed. Since our army retreated the day before yesterday, part of the Japanese army also retreated last night (24th). This morning (25th), the front line is extremely quiet, and no Japanese planes have been seen over Beiping. People's hearts are also gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army was facing off against Song Zheyuan's 29th Army at Xifengkou, Song's troops bravely fought the enemy, causing the Japanese army to suffer a major setback, and harboring resentment. This time, when Song's troops retreated from Xifengkou, the Japanese army intended to retaliate, tracking and pursuing them. After Song's troops retreated to Tongzhou, they continued to be pressured, and several attacks were repelled by Song's troops. From yesterday onwards, the Japanese army in that area stopped attacking and retreated to Xiazhen Town, more than 20 miles east of Tongzhou, at night. At the same time, the Japanese army that crossed the river from Yanjia Town also retreated to Yanjia Town. The area was quiet this morning. Order is gradually being restored in Tongzhou City. The station and agencies that were damaged by artillery fire are being rebuilt. Trains are running directly to Tongzhou and Shunyi this morning. The Japanese army that moved south from Miyun the day before yesterday once attacked the position of Xiao Zhichu's army, with some skirmishes. Yesterday, the fighting stopped, and the Japanese army retreated more than ten miles. Nothing happened today. North of Changping, the enemy advanced along the Pinggu Highway, attacking the position of Fu Zuoyi's army. After two days of fighting, both sides suffered losses. It has also stopped since yesterday. In the Xianghe area, the Japanese army concentrated its forces, seemingly intending to put pressure on a key station on the Beining Railway, seeking to cut off the traffic between Pingjin. The Mou Mou two divisions have been transferred to block the area, and there should be no problem. In the Ninghe area, the puppet army of Li Jichun harassed the area the day before yesterday. Yesterday, our reinforcements were transferred to hold Xiguan, confronting the puppet army in the city. No contact occurred between the two sides.</p>
<p>The situation on all fronts is very relaxed today. However, due to the complexity of relations between the parties, the peace issue cannot be completely resolved in a few words in a short period of time. Twists and turns are inevitable. Efforts are still being made to progress. According to general observations, there should be no problems with the security of Pingjin for the time being, but the future is not yet optimistic.

<h3>Banditry Rampant in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Red Bandits Use Smoke Bombs to Attack Guangdong Army Defenses</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Resolves to Take Command of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, taking advantage of the national crisis and the emergency in Pingjin, the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province have been stirred up again, especially the bandits in southeastern Jiangxi. Yesterday (19th), according to a telegram from the front, the Red bandits actually used smoke bombs to attack the Guangdong army's defenses. It stated that the Red bandits attacking the Yongxi line approached our army within 200-300 meters and then released smoke bombs. When our officers and soldiers smelled it, they felt cold all over. Investigation revealed that when the smoke bombs exploded, there was a bang, and only thick yellow smoke was seen. After about tens of seconds, breathing felt like sulfuric acid and a pungent taste. Those affected sneezed and felt a slight chill on their bodies, which soon recovered. The casings of the bombs were collected and studied and found to be purely homemade, wrapped in tinplate, shaped like a round one-and-a-half-pound water bottle. The bandits who attacked this time were from Ye Jianying's unit, commanding under the name of the Southeast Operations Political Affairs Committee of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, with about 3,000 people. There were ventilation holes all over the bombs, but how they were thrown is currently unclear. Also, local people say that the bandits suffered 300-400 casualties in the battle and have now fled to the Xingguo area, etc. According to reports, Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group of Guangdong Province, recently ordered the Independent First Division under Huang Renhuan, stationed in the Jiaoling area, to advance towards the bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi. Huang's division has now transferred four regiments of troops from Jiaoling to Jitanchengjiang and other places in southeastern Jiangxi. The vanguard unit, Zhong Shaokui's brigade, has already arrived at a certain location to concentrate. As for the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Third Army stationed in Dongjiang, they were also ordered to mobilize entirely yesterday and advance towards eastern Jiangxi. The two divisions will be commanded by Zhou Zhi, Chief of Staff of the Third Army (because Li Yangjing, the Commander of the Third Army, is still recuperating in the province). The headquarters of the Third Army will be moved from Chao'an to Meixian. After the Seventh and Eighth Divisions enter Jiangxi, a part of the teaching division will be transferred from the province to take over the defense of the Chaoshan area. In addition, since the Communist bandits in western Jiangxi and other places were suppressed by the majority of the Hunan army, the bandits have scattered in all directions. A group of about 1,000 people fled to the Rucheng area on the Hunan border. Investigation revealed that Rucheng is connected to Renhua County in northern Guangdong. The Guangdong authorities have been reported to have ordered two regiments of the North River defense forces to go to the city gate of Renhua for strict defense. As for Chen Jitang, since he was appointed by the Central Government as the Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression in the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, he has indeed been preparing to take office. He has been busy preparing for departure for days, and has been actively carrying out preparations for the procurement of military supplies, the organization of the headquarters, and transportation. Even the plaque of the Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression in the five provinces is being manufactured. Judging from this, Chen's taking the post of Commander-in-Chief of bandit suppression should not change. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Textile Mill</h3>
<p>Labor Dispute Still Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>Unemployed Workers from Zhenhuan Petition the Headquarters</p>
<p>Provincial Party Department Decides to Order the Factory to Resume Work Immediatley</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The closure of the Wuchang Zhenhuan Textile Mill due to losses has caused a labor dispute. For days, the workers have been appealing to various agencies, but there has been no way to resolve it. On the 24th, Hu Peichu, a supervisor of the Textile Industry Union, led more than 40 worker representatives to the Construction Department to petition again, where they were received by Zhang Zhengxing, who said that he had sent a special official, Hu Bao, to contact the factory and asked them to endure and wait patiently for a resolution. The next day, the worker representatives went to the Party and Government Committee of the Headquarters to petition again, where they were received by Chen Juewu. The representatives handed over a petition, which stated, "The Zhenhuan Textile Mill suddenly closed on the 22nd, without prior approval from the government or advance notice to the workers. This was a bolt from the blue, leaving the workers on the brink of despair. The recession in the textile industry in our country is not limited to Wuchang, nor just the Zhenhuan Mill. It is setting a precedent to suddenly leave more than 3,000 workers unemployed at a time of national crisis. What is their intention? For the sake of our livelihoods and the future of the national economy, the workers have no choice but to appeal to the General, who saves the country and the people, to strictly order the company to resume work immediately, so as to prevent the workers from becoming starving corpses." Chen said that the facts were not yet clear and needed to be investigated and verified. The worker representatives withdrew without getting what they wanted. The Textile Workers' Union, after repeated negotiations, received no concrete response from the factory, and the military and political authorities had no mediation measures. All the workers were extremely angry. If this continued, it was feared that the workers would expand the disturbance due to their urgent need for a livelihood, and it would be difficult to bear this heavy responsibility. Therefore, on the 25th, they submitted requests to various military and political agencies for instructions. That day happened to be the regular meeting of the Provincial Party Department. All the members sympathized with the workers. After deliberation, it was decided to order the Zhenhuan Textile Mill to resume operations immediately to maintain the workers' livelihoods and to recommend Yang Zaichun, a member, to be responsible for mediation together with a member appointed by the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government also scheduled a discussion at the regular meeting on the 26th. During this labor dispute, more than 3,000 workers have been running around appealing, without overstepping their bounds, which has garnered much sympathy from society. The authorities are also paying close attention. However, the attitude of the factory is quite firm, and it is not yet known whether there will be a satisfactory outcome. Investigation revealed that the factory's capital is 1.3 million yuan and has more than 3,000 workers. According to the factory, it has lost more than 700,000 yuan. If this is not an exaggeration, then resuming work will not be easy. As for other textile mills, apart from the Yuhua Mill, which has a capital of 5 million yuan, 3 million yuan in public reserve and surplus, and only 4,000 workers, which can still maintain the status quo, the Minsheng Mill, with a capital of 400,000 yuan and 3,000 workers, can also barely maintain after reducing wages. However, the First Textile Mill is also surrounded by crises. The mill has a capital of approximately 4 million yuan and more than 9,000 workers. Although it is managed by Chinese, it has been mortgaged to the foreign firm Anley &amp; Ying, with a mortgage of 3 million taels. In reality, it is no longer owned by Chinese. In recent years, the mill has lost more than 1.3 million yuan and is also brewing a suspension of operations. However, the factory authorities are currently pursuing a loan of 2 million yuan from Sassoon &amp; Company. If this can be achieved, they can continue to operate. Otherwise, they will inevitably have to suspend operations, and more than 9,000 workers will again have no recourse. (25th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Arrests by Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Manchurian White Russians</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, since the exposure of a large-scale conspiracy plan by the anti-Japanese Manchurian intelligence network of White Russians in (puppet) "Manchukuo," all newspapers have been banned from publishing the information until the 15th, when the ban was lifted. The contents are briefly recorded as follows: Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the so-called Lost Territory Recovery Army movement dispatched by Zhang Xueliang has been relying on White Russians to provide anti-Japanese Manchurian intelligence materials and external propaganda regarding the investigation of the internal situation of "Manchukuo." This was detected by the Manchukuo authorities, and after repeated strict investigations, on the 27th, a man named Mi Hua Yinuofu suddenly checked into a Changchun hotel and secretly sent a letter from Huo Erhuade, a major leader of the White Russians in the Far East, to Russian Pugen and others living in Changchun. On March 5, many related documents were found in Pugen's home. Therefore, the White Russians scattered in Dalian, Fengtian, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places were all arrested. The investigation revealed that the central figures in this incident were Huo Erhuade and Ji Ji Airisi, two major leaders, whose subordinates lived in major cities and specialized in investigating the movements of the Japanese army and the internal situation of "Manchukuo," placing Japan and Manchukuo in an internationally disadvantageous position and hindering the construction of "Manchukuo," thereby restraining the actions of the Japanese army. Huo Erhuade and Ji Ji Airisi not only had contact with the intelligence agencies of a certain country, but also reported the information of a certain country to the International League of Nations Office in Geneva through the White Russians. Therefore, the Director of the Police Department of "Manchukuo," Mr. Nagao (Japanese), believes that the matter is serious and will impose severe punishments.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aviation Department Plans</h3>
<p>Air Defense Exercises This Autumn</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Combined Fleet into a Standing Fleet — American-Made New Airship Guards the Pacific Coast</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on May 21st, the Army Aviation Headquarters has been planning exercises since last summer. The first large-scale air defense exercise by the air force is scheduled for October, centered on Akenohara, Kakamigahara, and Mimatahara. All flying units and flying schools will participate in full force. The commanders of the East and West armies will be Generals Tokugawa and Asada, continuing to practice real combat day and night. As for the final offensive and defensive battle, assuming an attack army flying from the Pacific coast and the aerial battle of the defensive army, more than 100 aircraft will fiercely fight in the air. After the exercise is completed, a scaled-down exercise will be held. At the same time, the Combined Fleet, which was temporarily formed, and the First and Second Fleets will be reorganized into a standing fleet, with Admiral Koshiro Oikawa, Commander of the First Fleet, concurrently serving as Commander of the Combined Fleet, and Rear Admiral Yoshikazu Ugo serving as Chief of Staff. The content of the fleet's organization is as follows: (1) The First Fleet includes the First Squadron (ships such as Kongo, Hyuga, Mutsu, and Haruna), the Seventh Squadron (ships such as Abukuma, Yura, and Natori), the First Torpedo Squadron (Yumihari, 22nd Destroyer Division, 23rd Destroyer Division, 30th Destroyer Division), and the First Submarine Squadron (Jingei, 28th Submarine Division, 30th Submarine Division); (2) The Second Fleet includes the Fourth Squadron (ships such as Takao, Atago, Maya, and Chokai), the Sixth Squadron (Kinugasa, Kako, Aoba), the Second Torpedo Squadron (Jintsu, 7th Destroyer Division, 8th Destroyer Division, 11th Destroyer Division, 12th Destroyer Division), and the Second Submarine Fleet (Kuma, 18th Submarine Division, 19th Submarine Division); (3) The Third Fleet includes the Tenth Squadron (Izumo, Tenryu, 27th Destroyer Division) and the Eleventh Squadron (Tsushima, Ataka, Uji, Sumida, Fushimi, Toba, Seta, Katata, Hira, Hozu, Atami, Futami, 24th Destroyer Division, Urakaze); (4) The First Air Squadron includes Kaga and Hosho. The Second Destroyer Division is attached to the Combined Fleet, and other ships such as Irimiya, Naruto, Tsurumi, and Notoro are also included.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo said on the same day that the United States is deploying new airships to guard the Pacific coast. After the tragedy of the Akron airship, the United States is still determined to proceed with its aviation policy. Since the completion of the Macon, it is now actively building new airships. The Macon belongs to the Army and Air Force. The newly built airship is named T.C. 13 and is a soft-type airship for the Army. It officially flew on the 27th. The Tachikawa-cho military aviation office in Japan has obtained information that the airship has entered the hangar in Akron City and will be deployed to guard the Pacific coast.</p>
<h3>Jieyang Youmazhashan Township</h3>
<p>A Major Massacre Occurs</p>
<p>Two Clans Clash, Resulting in Over Twenty Casualties</p>
<p>County Government, Upon Hearing the News, Insists on Strict Handling</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Mianhu District of Jieyang County borders Punin and Fengshun counties, approximately forty miles from Jieyang City. Due to obstructed transportation, various clans reside in separate villages and have historically been on bad terms. There exist divisions such as large villages versus small villages, major clans versus minor clans, powerful lineages versus weak lineages, and "red" factions versus "white" factions. Minor issues often escalate into revenge killings and violent clashes. In the past, events such as the conflict between Fengshun’s Pucang and Yangxia villages, and Punin’s Nigou and Baxiang villages, originated from extremely minor incidents, leading to the tragic burning of villages and killing of people. Those who speak of these past events still feel lingering fear. On the ninth of this month, Lin Zaifa of Tonghang, relying on his large clan population (approximately 16,000 men), cut down longan trees belonging to the Huang clan of the neighboring Youmazhashan village for firewood. When the Huang clan attempted to stop him, Lin refused and responded with harsh words, leading to a verbal dispute that escalated into a physical fight. Determining right from wrong was difficult. After being beaten, Lin Zaifa informed his father and clansmen. On the eleventh, the villagers gathered with weapons and attacked Youmazhashan village, killing many members of the Huang clan and imprisoning women in one location. They looted extensively, taking away cattle and clothing. The Huang clan only had four hundred men, a significantly smaller force compared to the Lin clan, and therefore dared not resist. Local gentry, seeing the unfavorable situation, stepped in to mediate. However, the Lin clan was stubborn, demanding a fine of five hundred yuan from the Huang clan. The Huang clan refused to submit. On the thirteenth, more than thirty women went to the county government to seek assistance and request protection. Upon learning that the Huang clan had filed a complaint with the authorities, the Lin clan simultaneously mobilized strong men and prepared weapons, and reported to the Mianhu Security Guard platoon, claiming that bandits were plotting to attack Tonghang from villages such as Youmazhashan Fengkezhai. The Security Guard platoon believed this to be true and, armed with guns and ammunition, entered Youmazhashan village on the morning of the fourteenth, barging into homes and firing indiscriminately, discharging thousands of bullets, resulting in over twenty casualties and the burning of a clan hall and dozens of houses. They also abducted nine people. Lin clan strong men assisted from within, causing great chaos. Subsequently, they proceeded to Fengkezhai to burn and kill, as Fengke, Maqiu, and Liushuipu villages were all part of the White Flag faction. On the fifteenth, the county government dispatched Zhang Cexun leading a Security Guard Brigade to suppress the situation. Court prosecutor Zhang Peiling, along with a clerk, went to the scene to investigate and examine the injuries. On the sixteenth, they further investigated Fengkezhai. On that day, sixty to seventy women refugees from the Huang clan of Youmazhashan rushed to the county government and various branch offices to voice their grievances, with disheveled hair and bare feet, their plight was pitiable. On the seventeenth, County Magistrate Xie Henian personally went to Tonghang village to investigate and detained local gentry Lin Xiangzhen and Lin Huiyan at the brigade headquarters for questioning. It is reported that the Red and White Flag factions have been secretly brewing a major conflict for a long time. The Lin clan Red Flag faction had previously organized a farmers' association before the sixteenth year of the Republic and used special powers to oppress other clans. Later, smaller villages and mixed clans, with the support of the Purification Party and the White Flag faction, retaliated against the Red Flag using the same tactics. Currently, both sides are actively preparing for war and discriminating against each other. The Zhang clan of Puzhaizhai and the Lin clan of Yangxia village are building earthen walls and gun emplacements on the mountaintops in their respective villages, working day and night. The scope of this conflict involves several counties, with major clan divisions arising in various districts and villages. Consequently, people in Jieyang, recalling past events, cannot help but turn pale at the mention of conflict. County gentry Deng Guoliang, Lin Kuichu, Guo Ruifu, and dozens of others are separately mediating in various locations. On the eighteenth, over sixty women refugees from the Huang clan came to Shantou to petition the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner to seek justice and protect the innocent. The county government is paying close attention to this matter. As the military is currently engaged in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, there is great concern that the conflict will escalate, affecting local security. Therefore, they insist on strict handling to prevent the situation from expanding. It is reported that the mediators are successfully persuading reconciliation in various villages, with good prospects for resolution. (Twenty-third)</p>
<h3>Signs of Drought Seen in Chao-Shan This Spring</h3>
<p>Rainbow Halo Around the Sun in the Sky</p>
<p>Villagers Pray to Gods for Rain</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: On the morning of the nineteenth, the weather in Chao-Shan was exceptionally hot. At eleven o'clock, a slight breeze suddenly arose, and fleeting clouds transformed unpredictably in the sky. People believed that heavy rain was imminent. After a while, the wind calmed, and the scorching sun blazed overhead. Suddenly, a five-colored rainbow halo appeared around the sun, its colors bright and pleasing to the eye, lasting for about half an hour before gradually dissipating. Residents gathered on the streets to look up and admire it, marveling at the spectacle. Superstitious individuals considered it an ominous sign, and rumors spread rapidly. This spring in Chao-Shan has been marked by severe drought. In February, a smallpox epidemic broke out, spreading quickly. Currently, cerebrospinal meningitis is also prevalent and spreading rapidly. One acute form of the disease causes dizziness and drowsiness at the onset, followed by convulsions in the limbs and strained breathing, leading to death in less than two hours. Many children over ten years old in the Western Pass of Chaoan have contracted the disease, and several have died before treatment could be administered. Mangoes, bayberries, lychees, peaches, and plums have already appeared on the market, and cholera and diarrhea are also emerging alongside them. The epidemic is rampant, all due to the arid weather. The drought situation this spring is extremely serious in various counties. The early rice harvest is only about forty percent. Coupled with the continuous lack of rain, the rice leaves have turned dry and yellow. Dabu and other counties have already reported the disaster to the provincial government. In Chaoan and Jieyang counties, rain-prayer ceremonies were held last month. Dozens of benevolent societies, along with five or six hundred Buddhist disciples, carried statues of deities in processions through the streets, kneeling every three steps to prostrate themselves to the sky. On the eighteenth, praying and kneeling groups were also formed in Chaoyang Dahu and other places. In Dabu Sanheba, a rain-requesting drumming team was organized. People carried dozens of large drums, carrying the deities and parading along the streets, beating the drums loudly, resembling thunder. The drummers and the praying procession all wore bamboo hats and inserted banyan tree leaves, a custom passed down through generations. In Meixian, known for its advanced education, a Guanyin-praying team also appeared on the seventeenth. The monasteries and temples in Meixian have a type of nun who does not shave her head, known as a "zhaifu," who specializes in praying on behalf of people to resolve calamities and release the souls of the dead. This spring drought was initiated by zhaifu from the west, carrying Guanyin statues in processions, gathering hundreds of zhaifu from the entire county, all dressed in black skirts and inserting green leaves in their hair, marching in formation. Ignorant and foolish people set up incense tables at their doorways, bowing their heads in prostration, which is truly laughable. (Twenty-third)</p>
<h3>Shandong Construction Bureau Dredges Jinan's Famous Springs</h3>
<p>Historically Known as the Seventy-Two Springs of Lixia</p>
<p>Willow Catkins and Yellow Flowers Offer Opportunities for Remembrance</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jishui River flows underground. Ancient texts claim that the springs of Lixia gush out everywhere, numbering seventy-two. Ancient people said, "The mountains and waters of Lixia are the best in Shandong, and the springs are the best in the world," which is not an exaggeration. However, with the passage of time, except for the well-known major springs, which still have remnants that can be found, the rest have been lost and forgotten. The current provincial government is the former palace of the Ming Dynasty Prince, and there are dozens of springs within its grounds. The most famous ones are the Pearl Spring, White Cloud Spring, Zhuoying Spring, and South Tutu Spring. The Baotu Spring remains one of the famous scenic spots today. Dozens of paces east of Baotu Spring is the former residence of the Song Dynasty female poet Li Qingzhao (now the Provincial Medical School). Famous springs within the residence, such as the Golden Coin Spring, Nenyu Spring, Willow Catkin Spring, and Yellow Flower Spring, also have historical value. Poets and writers often visit to remember her, and whenever they recall the line "Don't say it doesn't break the heart, the curtains roll up in the west wind, the person is thinner than the yellow flower," they linger and are reluctant to leave. The Construction Bureau, in order to renovate Xiaoqing River, has investigated and dredged various famous springs in Jinan to increase the water source, and a total of fifty-three locations have been identified. The names of the springs are as follows: (1) Ancient Jinhu Pool, in the Sumeru Garden of the Fan family at No. 10 South Shuncheng Street.

<h3>Letter from the Construction Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Government</h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the two articles published in your newspaper on the 24th of this month, "Merchants and People in the Old Quzhou Region of Zhejiang Province Oppose Highway Stock Funds," are largely inconsistent with the facts. The "Provisional Measures for Raising Funds for Road Construction in Various Counties of the Old Quzhou Region of Zhejiang Province" were implemented after a resolution by the Provincial Government Committee. Regarding the methods for raising stock funds, there are two categories: (1) Soliciting donations from wealthy individuals in the local area; (2) Collecting stock funds from the old Quzhou region's bamboo, timber, and charcoal, which are borne by the owners. However, for the convenience of collection, the merchants will first pay the road stock, and then be issued stock certificates. The contributing people can share the benefits, which is different from ordinary donations and taxes. The establishment of the Stock Fund Raising Committee and its branch offices is also different from the nature of setting up checkpoints for levying taxes. If the staff members of the offices are found to be making things difficult, demanding bribes, or embezzling funds, they will be severely punished according to the law once reported. Previously, it was reported that timber merchants in Yongjia hired workers to Qingtai to forcibly release rafts. This Bureau immediately telegraphed the magistrate of Qingtai County to provide proper guidance and to either pay the stock fund or pay a security deposit before allowing the release. If the merchants comply with the regulations, the offices will not detain them without authorization. As for the claim of firing guns as a threat, it is even more of an exaggeration. This road stock is very important for the development of transportation in eastern Zhejiang. All the details are reported to the Provincial Government by this Bureau for review. Deeply concerned that there may be misunderstandings due to rumors, we have sent this letter requesting that you promptly make corrections. Sincerely, Construction Bureau of Zhejiang Provincial Government, May 25th.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>News of Zhu Yunting's Suicide</p>
<p>Zhu Yunting from the East Gate was only thirty years old. His father had accumulated an estate worth about six or seven thousand taels of gold through a lifetime of hard work and toil. After his father passed away, Yunting sought to profit from the assets and invested in the Lifeng Cotton Weaving Factory. However, the business was sluggish and suffered some losses. Despite this, Zhu was employed at the factory and rose to become a respectable merchant. He then conceived the idea of building a house and contracted a local contractor for the construction in the winter of the previous year, estimating the cost at over two thousand yuan. While bricks and wood were being transported to his home, a relative saw this and strongly recommended a contractor named Bao. Initially, the construction cost was similar to the previous estimate. Zhu, lured by sweet words, signed a contract with Bao to undertake the construction. Unexpectedly, after the construction started, Bao claimed that the original accounts were missing many items and gradually increased the price. By the time the construction was completed in the winter of the following year, the cost had reached a staggering seven or eight thousand yuan. Moreover, Bao used various means to demand payment urgently. Mr. Zhu, feeling that his inheritance had been exhausted and that he still owed four or five thousand yuan, and suffering repeated irritations, became disillusioned with life. He went to Shanghai the day before yesterday and committed suicide by taking poison at a relative's house. His family reported the incident and claimed the body for burial in Songjiang. He left behind an elderly mother, a wife, and several children, whose livelihoods are now extremely difficult. It is said that Contractor Bao made a profit of three thousand yuan from building Zhu's house, and the person who made the introduction also received a commission of seven hundred yuan. Zhu Yunting's pursuit of vanity and poor judgment led to a tragic end. Commentators lamented his fate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Two New Judges Added to the County Court</p>
<p>The number of civil and criminal lawsuits in this county is high. The adjudication division of the County Court originally had one president who also served as a substantive judge, and three probationary judges. As these were insufficient, the Ministry of Justice has appointed Pan Jiatian as a trainee judge, who has already arrived at his post. In addition, the Procuratorate originally had two procurators. After Procurator Du Jiasheng was transferred back to Zhenjiang to resume his original post, the cases handled by Procurators Zhou Erkai and Shen Zhaoming were extremely busy. The Higher Procuratorate was petitioned, which in turn petitioned the Ministry of Justice, to appoint Jin Fengao as a procurator, and he is expected to arrive in Wuxi soon.</p>

At about 1 a.m. on the 23rd of this month, eight bandits broke down the front door and rushed in, overturning chests and ransacking at will for about an hour. Before leaving, they kidnapped Fang's ten-year-old son, leaving a red paper note that read, "Contact between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the 26th in the Sibaidu area. A 'meeting gift' of 5,000 yuan is required, along with two large boxes of cigarettes. The signal is a hand-held lantern with a green bamboo pole. Only two people are allowed. If there are three, we will open fire and kill."

<p>The relief institution requires a large amount of funds for various relief undertakings.

Gu Haojia contacted the automobile company on the 26th. The company expressed that it was impossible to refuse, but feared that the passengers would object. It was necessary to pass the county political meeting and submit it to the province for approval before allowing the collection. All the small automobile companies were unwilling to comply.</p>

<h3>Completion of the Shanghai-Chengdu Air Route</h3>
<p>Officially Inaugurated on June 1st</p>
<p>Post Office Sells Commemorative Envelopes</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Chengdu line (Shanghai to Chengdu) of the China National Aviation Corporation previously only went to Chongqing. Now the Chongqing to Chengdu section has been scheduled to open on June 1 (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly recorded it as June 8). The entire line has now been completed. The fees for air mail from Shanghai to Chengdu are calculated as two flight zones (each 1,000 miles is a flight zone), namely Shanghai-Hankou as one flight zone and Hankou-Chengdu as another flight zone. In addition to the normal postage, an additional airmail fee of 25 cents per 20 grams or fraction thereof is charged for each flight zone. To commemorate the opening of the Shanghai-Chengdu air route, the Shanghai North Suzhou Road Postal Administration has prepared "Shanghai-Chengdu Air Route Opening Commemorative Envelopes" for sale on Monday, the 29th. The number of these envelopes is very limited. The price is 5 cents each. All mail destined for various locations on the Chongqing-Chengdu air route that is intended to be sent out when the air route opens must be posted on or before Monday, the 29th.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Pond of the China National Aviation Corporation, accompanied by Mr. Baker of the Flying Corps and Mr. Chaplim, the postal officer of this city, flew directly from Shanghai to Chongqing yesterday (the 26th) in a plane of the company, covering a distance of 2,600 kilometers non-stop. After departing from Shanghai in the early morning, they were scheduled to arrive in Chongqing in the late afternoon in order to fly from Chongqing to Chengdu tomorrow (the 28th) for a test flight between Chongqing and Chengdu, and to officially open the route on Thursday (June 1st). The distance between Chongqing and Chengdu is 306 kilometers, while the distance from Shanghai to Chongqing is 2,658 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Shanghai-Guangdong Air Route</h3>
<p>July 1st</p>
<p>A spokesman for the China National Aviation Corporation told reporters from the Aviation News Agency yesterday that in order to open the Shanghai-Guangdong air route, the company had previously sent Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the flight crew, with radio equipment to various stations along the route to prepare everything. According to the report, the progress is quite smooth. It has been decided to officially open the route on July 1st. There will be daily flights except on Mondays, arriving on the same day, several days earlier than by ship. The airmail rates and ticket prices have not yet been determined, but the airmail fee will probably only be calculated as one air zone, and the one-way ticket price will not exceed 250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Aviation Donations for Aircraft</h3>
<p>Public Groups Should Be Allowed Freedom</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Aviation Association Prove Ineffective</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Shanghai's fundraising committee has raised over 96,000 yuan since it began its small-scale fundraising efforts. Recognizing the urgency of the national crisis and to encourage enthusiastic participation in aviation for national salvation, the committee ordered a fighter plane from the British Vickers-Armstrong Company. The general office of the China Aviation Association's fundraising team learned of this and sent Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang to visit Mr. Lin Mianzhai, an officer of the Ningbo Sojourners' Association, at 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang claimed that the Aviation Association had decided that all aviation donations should be centralized within the Aviation Association, then remitted to the municipal government, which would then purchase the aircraft. He asked why the Ningbo Sojourners' Association was acting independently and requested a clear response that afternoon. Lin replied that aviation for national salvation was a matter of voluntary donation by the public and that public groups should be allowed the freedom to purchase aircraft independently, and he declined the request. It is also reported that the Tianchu MSG Factory also voluntarily donated 100,000 silver dollars for aviation for national salvation, and the Aviation Association's office has repeatedly sent personnel to request the funds, but without success. Negotiations are still underway.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory Association Cables Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>To Stop the Discount Sale of Enemy Goods</p>
<p>Listing Four Reasons</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters yesterday, requesting a ban on the auction of enemy goods. The telegram stated, "During the factory representatives' meeting convened by our association on May 25th, Standing Committee member Zhang Zilian proposed that he had previously seen reports in Hangzhou newspapers about a public auction of enemy goods confiscated since the September 18th Incident. Zilian raised objections, citing four reasons: (1) The auction of enemy goods undermines the movement for economic severance with Japan. (2) The auction of enemy goods opens the door for merchants to privately traffic in enemy goods. (3) The auction of enemy goods encourages the public to use enemy goods, stifling their sense of shame and aversion towards the enemy and openly violates the government's order to use domestic goods. (4) The auction of enemy goods will greatly impact the anti-Japanese goods movement in various provinces and cities. Zhejiang's initiation of such action is a loss of Zhejiang's integrity. A letter had already been sent to the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association requesting the cancellation of the original proposal. As this matter concerns the violation of the entire plan for economic severance with Japan, our Shanghai member factories should unanimously advocate for a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters to instruct a ban. Please render a public decision." The entire body of representatives resolved, based on Standing Committee member Zhang's proposal, to adopt the following measures: (1) Telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters to instruct the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association to cease the auction of enemy goods. (2) Advise all goods owners to voluntarily burn enemy goods to express their patriotic fervor. (3) Donate the confiscated enemy goods to frontline soldiers. (4) Before the lost territories of the Northeast are recovered, enemy goods should continue to be sealed up. This has been recorded in the minutes. We hereby submit this matter to your office for review, earnestly requesting that you consider the gravity of the national crisis and, after examining the four reasons proposed by Zhang Zilian and the four measures resolved by the representatives' meeting, issue instructions to the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to halt the proposed auction of Japanese goods, in order to implement the entire plan for economic severance with Japan."</p>

<h3>Inspection of Concession Factories</h3>
<p>Negotiations Progressing Smoothly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the inspection of concession factories, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, based on centrally determined principles, has been consulting with Mr. Feixin Dun, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, on a resolution. Progress is quite smooth, and it has been decided to continue discussions early next month to achieve a quick resolution. According to sources familiar with the situation, the Municipal Council no longer insists on opposing the Municipal Government's implementation of sovereignty over the inspection of concession factories, as they are well aware that this pertains to China's overall sovereignty and cannot be seized. Therefore, the focus of negotiations is no longer on the issue of sovereignty but on how to ensure the safety of equipment in the factories within the concession and how to conduct inspections. According to Municipal Council sources, it is expected that the outcome of the negotiations will be that the inspection work will be jointly conducted by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council, with the highest authority belonging to the Municipal Government.</p>

<p>General Li's representatives Wang Ziyao and Liu Piguang, along with Zhang Songhan, representatives from various charitable organizations, and Ge Yunson, representative of the Joint Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees, went to the North Station to assist. After disembarking, they took a commemorative photo and were transported in two Yong'an Moving Company cars to their rented residence at No. 17 Caishou Lane on Route Gustavia. Due to the large amount of luggage, it was not until 10:00 PM that they were able to retrieve it. Mr. Ge Yunson immediately agreed to lend 18 existing quilts from the association for their use. According to the wife of Brigade Commander Yu Jiechen, who arrived in Shanghai with the group, Beiping and Tianjin are peaceful and the people are stable, but traitors are still actively causing trouble.</p>
<h3>Lang Guanpu Left for Hong Kong Yesterday to Welcome Ma</h3>

<h3>Japanese Spokesman Talks About Japanese Ambassador's Trip to the North</h3>
<p>Awaiting Instructions from the Japanese Government to Meet Huang Fu</p>
<p>Will Express Opposition to Our Revised Tariff Rates</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, there have been widespread rumors that Japanese Ambassador to China Akira Ariyoshi will travel north to Beiping to meet with Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping. At the same time, Japanese merchants in this port have expressed strong opposition to our customs' revised tariff rates. Yesterday, a reporter met with a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate in this port to discuss these two issues. The conversation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Will Go North</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Consulate did not deny the news that Japanese Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi was about to travel north, but said that he was still waiting for instructions from the Japanese government, so it was not yet certain whether the trip would take place. However, if he could go north, he would naturally meet with Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping. A foundation for peace in the north has been established with certainty, but the detailed methods of the ceasefire and post-ceasefire are still under study by both sides. As this concerns military diplomacy, I regret that I cannot comment.</p>
<h3>Oppose Our Revised Tariffs</h3>
<p>As for the Chinese government's revised tariff rates, which are much higher than before, especially affecting Japanese goods to a great extent, the Japanese government and merchants unanimously believe that this is an intentional attempt to boycott Japanese goods. Therefore, all parties are studying the details. If instructions from the Japanese government arrive in Shanghai, the Japanese Embassy will express its opposition to China.</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Will Return to Shanghai from Hangzhou in a Few Days</h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Plans to Host Various Sectors</p>
<p>To Report on the Situation of Relief in North China</p>
<p>To Discuss Future Cooperation Methods</p>
<p>Interview with Wan Bi Zhi, Vice President of the Swastika General Association</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling, President of the Red Swastika Society of China, recently accompanied Wan Bi, Vice President of the Society, from Beijing to Shanghai to discuss with the Shanghai Red Swastika Society and people from all walks of life the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers and refugees in various parts of North China, and to prepare for future relief efforts. It is reported that after Xiong and others arrived in Shanghai, they discussed the matter with members of the Shanghai Swastika Branch. They will soon invite people from all walks of life to discuss cooperation methods. As this matter is of great importance to the wounded soldiers and refugees in North China,</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Relief Team Treats Wounded and Nursing Women</h3>
<p>I specifically visited Xiong Xiling at the Shanghai General Office of the Society yesterday. Unfortunately, Xiong had gone to Hangzhou and had not returned. I asked Wan Bi, Vice President of the Society, about everything. According to Wan, the relief work in North China was very detailed. The main points of his conversation are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Yuyu War, our Society has organized a relief team to implement relief efforts. After the war expanded, a total of 27 relief teams were organized and stationed in various key locations along the Great Wall and in the Luotang area to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees for three months without stopping for a single day. When leaving Beiping, Beiping and Tianjin were extremely tense. Regarding the safety of wounded soldiers and refugees, President Xiong had already discussed the matter with Chairman Han during his crossing and agreed that wounded soldiers could be moved to Tai'an and other places if necessary. Recent telegrams from Beiping indicate that</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Relief Team Treats Wounded People</h3>
<p>Regarding the placement of wounded soldiers, in addition to a portion being transported by the relevant divisions and brigades to safe locations, the remaining wounded soldiers admitted to the temporary hospitals of our Society in Beiping and Tianjin are now being transported separately to Shandong and Henan provinces through the Red Swastika Society for proper accommodation. Although the war has now stopped, conflicts still occur from time to time between the two sides, and casualties are still significant. The relief teams of our Society have been transferred from various passes of the Great Wall to appropriate locations to provide assistance at any time. At the same time, people from various places have fled to the Beiping and Tianjin areas due to changes in the war situation, and our General Society and local charitable organizations are separately accommodating them in designated places. There are many refugees, so the temporary accommodation centers established by our Society are already overcrowded. Even if peace is realized, the disaster areas will be vast and the houses will be in ruins. Hundreds of thousands of refugees will have nowhere to return, and various rehabilitation efforts will be difficult to resolve in the future. Other issues such as the placement of wounded soldiers after recovery and various temporary relief efforts in the Beiping and Tianjin areas are all urgent issues at present. President Xiong of our Society will return to Shanghai in a few days and will host people from all walks of life to report on the progress of relief efforts and discuss the above-mentioned issues, as well as discuss future continued relief efforts. I hope that all sectors will cooperate effectively so that there can be satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Fifth Batch of Overseas Chinese Refugees from Mexico</h3>
<p>Returned to Their Native Place on the Original Ship Yesterday</p>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand People Have Not Yet Arrived</p>
<p>The fifth batch of overseas Chinese forced to return home from Mexico, after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, designated six people, including Chen Bang, to stay temporarily in Shanghai to facilitate contact. The rest all returned to their native place yesterday morning on the Dollar Steamship Company's ship. All expenses in Shanghai and travel expenses for returning to their native place were donated by the Global Overseas Chinese General Association and various charitable organizations in this city, and personnel were dispatched to assist. The overseas Chinese expressed their deep gratitude. More than ten thousand people who have already left Mexico but have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Guangzhao Guildhall, specifically visited Mayor Wu yesterday to discuss this matter. Mayor Wu advocated that overseas Chinese returning to the country should first return to their native place and then seek fundamental relief methods. As for the Global Overseas Chinese General Association's previous letter requesting Mayor Wu to serve as honorary chairman, it is now learned that Wu replied to the association yesterday that he was unable to serve due to his busy schedule. However, Mayor Wu is still responsible for assisting in the relief of distressed overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Replies to Japanese Ambassador's Visit</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Japanese Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi visited Russian Ambassador Bogomolov at the Russian Consulate on Xinzha Road at around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. It was rumored that the Japanese Ambassador's visit to Bogomolov was to negotiate informal consultations on the Sino-Soviet Railway. It is learned that the rumor is not true. The meeting between the two was purely a courtesy visit. At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Ambassador Bogomolov returned the visit to the Japanese Consulate on Waibaidu Bridge. The two spoke for about twenty minutes, and then the Russian ambassador left.</p>
<h3>American侨 to Visit Ward's Tomb Today</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, over seventy members and friends of the American Legion will visit General Ward's tomb in Songjiang tomorrow (the 28th). They are scheduled to depart from the North Station by train at 9:30 AM and return to Shanghai at 5:00 PM. During the visit to the tomb in Songjiang, Dr. Gail will deliver a eulogy, and the Songjiang County Magistrate will reply.

<h3>Zhejiang Chairman Lu Dipin Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, had previously gone to Beijing on official business. He has now completed his work and left Beijing the day before yesterday to return to Hangzhou. He had originally planned to return to the province on the Beijing-Hangzhou intermodal train, but he temporarily changed his plans and took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ship Jiang'an to Shanghai. When Lu boarded the ship, he changed his name and brought only four attendants. He lived alone in a large dining room and did not talk to anyone, so the passengers on the ship did not know that Chairman Lu was traveling with them. Lu was wearing a gray silk lined robe. It was not until yesterday morning, when the ship was about to arrive in Shanghai, that the military police escorting the ship learned of Chairman Lu's presence. The squad leader assigned two military policemen to stand guard outside Lu's room to show respect, but this caused Lu's displeasure. He ordered his attendants to inform the military police to remove the guard post to avoid attracting the attention of the passengers. At 10:30 AM, when the ship arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf in Shanghai, Lu and his four attendants disembarked unobtrusively. A car that had been waiting for Lu at the wharf was already parked in advance. Chairman Lu boarded the car and went straight to his residence in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Cables to Thank the Chamber of Commerce for Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "I have just received the car and five hundred broadswords donated by your esteemed association and the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce to our army. It is the duty of soldiers to resist insults and kill the enemy. I am deeply grateful for your generous assistance. I can only encourage the soldiers to annihilate the enemy and wipe out our national shame in order to live up to your expectations. I send this telegram to express my gratitude. Please accept my sincere respects."</p>

<p>Zhang Jingjiang and Gu Zhenggang took the overnight express train to Beijing last night and arrived in this port this morning.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association</h3>
<p>Advises Members to Persist in the Boycott</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association of this port have issued a notice to all licensed stores, stating, "Recently, the peace movement of our country's military authorities towards Japan has become public. Many citizens are becoming passive, and public morale is also becoming dissipated. We are deeply concerned that our members will not be able to persist in the boycott work. The notice reads: 'Respectfully, our association is working very hard to inspect inferior goods on this road in order to prevent their revival and to prevent us from being ashamed as businessmen of Nanjing Road and losing our role as a model for the business community in Shanghai. We are doing this work with great effort and a determined attitude, maintaining a firm spirit, regardless of how the situation changes. Our citizens must always adhere to their principles, implement the minimum national salvation movement, and fulfill their duties. We are issuing this warning again: If our inspectors find, or if we receive confidential reports and the evidence is solid, that inferior goods are still on display for sale, regardless of whether the reason is that a colleague misplaced them or that the identification was inaccurate, we will uniformly revoke the issued certificate and publish the name of the store and the facts in the newspaper. We urge you to exercise caution so as not to be unable to remedy the situation at that time, damaging your reputation and blaming our association for not being tolerant.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Continues to Inspect Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Meeting to be Held Soon to Discuss Departure Route</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the National Goods Movement Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city has specially organized an investigation team to eliminate enemy goods. Qiu Longtao, Tong Shuangyang, Zhu Zhichun, Fang Pei'shi, Ge Futian, and Chen Shude have been publicly elected as members of the team to depart and inspect Henan Road. It is learned that the association has completed the inspection. The association plans to convene a meeting of the investigation section soon to discuss the continued departure investigation route and date.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Stops Issuing Passports to Foreigners for Travel to Chahar</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating that since the situation in North China became tense, Chahar Province has become chaotic. Please instruct the Municipal Public Security Bureau to stop issuing passports to foreigners for travel to Chahar. If foreigners insist on obtaining passports to travel to Chahar Province, the Chinese government will not be responsible for any dangerous situations that may occur. It is learned that the Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>Shenxin No. 1 Factory Mediation Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Workers at the Shenxin No. 1 Cotton Mill in this port went on strike at 3:00 PM on the 25th and put forward conditions: (1) Restore the bonus system, (2) Fulfill the labor-capital contract, (3) Distribute past years' dividends, (4) Resolve pending cases, (5) Pay wages during the strike period. General Manager Rong Zongjing immediately went to the factory to persuade the workers, but failed to resolve the issue. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Jiao Hongen, Wang Guangqing, Lu Yinshu, and representatives of various party and government agencies went to the factory to convene a meeting between labor and capital. The directors and chairmen believed that in the face of national crisis, unity should be the goal, and both labor and capital had their own difficulties and should understand each other. Subsequently, Rong Zongjing reported on the difficulties of the yarn industry and the factory. He had previously gone to Beijing to request assistance from the central government, but there were no effective solutions. He originally intended to implement a full suspension of night shifts, but for the sake of social stability and workers' livelihoods, he could only seek to reduce costs within the possible range to maintain operations as much as possible. However, the workers did not understand his difficulties and took advantage of the factory's difficulties, which was not in the workers' best interests. Subsequently, representatives of the labor union expressed their opinions, stating that the bonus system could not be completely abolished and that wages must be paid during the strike period. After Director Wen repeatedly advised them, both labor and capital felt his sincere mediation, and the meeting was about to conclude. It was already 6:00 PM. Director Wen and representatives of various party and government agencies were about to leave the factory, and the factory also sent personnel to start the motor. However, the workers suddenly rioted again, and the motor that had been started was shut down again, so there were no results.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government and Various Bureaus</h3>
<p>Summer Office Hours Moved Earlier</p>
<p>To Be Implemented from June 1st</p>
<p>The office hours of the Municipal Government of this city will be changed from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, starting on June 1st. The Municipal Government has instructed all offices and bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Remit Funds to Support Frontline Generals</p>
<p>Donating 13,000 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China United News Agency reports that the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation received a telegram from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Phnom Penh, Vietnam, addressed to Chairman Xu of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, stating that "The news of the violent Japanese invasion of the Great Wall and approach to Beiping and Tianjin has caused great shock. Overseas Chinese in our city know that they have a responsibility for the country's rise and fall, so we have made a plan to save money and cut expenses. We have specifically donated 13,000 silver dollars, which has been remitted to the Bank of China in Beiping and Tianjin through the East Asia Bank here for distribution to General Song Zheyuan and Mr. Xiong Xiling, equally divided. This is a drop in the bucket, but we hope to fulfill the national duty as best we can. In addition to sending this telegram, we also report to you. Ling Jizhang, Acting Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Phnom Penh." The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Refugees Gather in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Qu Yingguang Requests Instructions on Relief Methods</p>
<p>Only 70,000 in Relief Funds Remaining</p>
<p>Unable to Implement According to Plan</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Qu Yingguang and others, the resident directors in Tianjin, reporting that refugees were gathering in Beiping and Tianjin, that there were only 70,000 yuan in relief funds remaining, and requesting instructions on how to handle relief matters. The original telegram read, "Please be advised to Xu Jinglao, Wang Yilao, and fellow philanthropists, we have received your telegram. There are still over 70,000 yuan in relief funds remaining. The 3,000 from the Red Swastika Society have not yet been allocated. It is estimated that this will only be enough for the accommodation centers jointly established with various churches, and for the monthly relief of Northeastern refugees for two months. Now that refugees are gathering in Beiping and Tianjin, if relief is to be distributed, at least one yuan for adults and 50 cents for children, it will not be possible to maintain the original plan. Please advise on how to proceed. Guangfen."</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying</h3>
<p>Sends Letter Requesting Relief for Victims in Lihuang</p>
<p>Estimated 24,000 Awaiting Rescue</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Relief and Reserve Committee, wrote to the Shanghai Provisional Relief Committee for the Disaster Areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces yesterday, stating that the disaster in Lihuang, Anhui, was severe and that relief was urgently needed, requesting verification and relief. The original letter reads, "Respectfully, according to the report from Fan Shuhong, Zhang Shi'en, and Wang Dongge, directors of the Lihuang relief center of our association, that the number of disaster victims in the accommodation centers here has increased to more than 1,100, requiring more than 600 kilograms of rice per day, and that there are more than 24,000 people awaiting rescue, who are constantly gathering and pleading, almost breaking down the doors, making it difficult to cope. Please ask your office to negotiate with the Relief Association of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and to allocate relief funds to save these people. The disaster in Lihuang is severe, and relief is urgently needed. We hereby send this letter requesting your association to verify and handle the matter. [omitted]."</p>
<h3>Northeast Refugee Relief Association Ships Emergency Medicines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, formerly due to refugees fleeing the war zone, and now suffering from epidemic diseases, had previously sent letters requesting aid in the form of medicines, to be transported for relief.

Please check and arrange for personnel to pick them up at the station.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Disabled and Wounded Hospital</h3>
<p>Medical Staff Member Gui Wan Northbound</p>
<p>The ninth team of medical personnel, consisting of 62 members, organized by the Shanghai office of the China Relief Frontline Disabled and Wounded Sanatorium, was originally scheduled to depart on the 23rd. However, due to the very limited number of medicines donated by various parties, which were insufficient for distribution, it was decided that 20 hygiene and rescue doctors, led by Gu Sheng, the deputy leader of the ninth team, would depart first and transfer north. The remaining 42 people will depart later. It is now learned that the 42 medical personnel of the team, led by team leader Wang Hanbin, departed last night on a night express train to the northeast, transferring to Ping. Furthermore, the tenth team of the hospital is currently in the process of being organized and will rush to the front line as soon as the organization is completed to rescue the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society Receives Latest Shaanxi Disaster Report</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society received a telegram yesterday from the Shaanxi Province Relief Affairs Association stating that the disaster in Shaanxi is severe and urgently requires relief. Heaven shows no mercy and has sent another strange disaster. According to reports from Pu, Lin, and Wei counties, on May 1st, black frost suddenly fell, followed by strong winds, and the remaining wheat seedlings withered completely. People are terrified, early autumn seeds are lacking, disaster victims are everywhere, and there is no way to seek help. They earnestly request assistance in raising funds for relief. Furthermore, a telegram from Qian Xiantian, the Magistrate of Mei County, stated, "Our country is poor, and Shaanxi is the poorest. Natural and man-made disasters have occurred for years, and Mei County is the most extreme. It is now the time between the green and yellow crops, and the people rely entirely on tree bark to survive. Although heaven has recently sent timely rain, but the amount obtained is small, and there is no hope for the summer and autumn harvests. There is a lack of seeds for autumn planting, the fields are barren, and artemisia is growing into forests. Without seeds at this time, how can we hope for a harvest? In the high autumn, the grass grows long, and the people of Mei County cannot avoid death. We have previously received relief and relied heavily on it for survival. The surviving people, who did not die in the famine year, will now die in a prosperous year. We are overwhelmed with anxiety and cannot rest. We earnestly request a large sum of money to save the disaster victims. Our descendants will be eternally grateful." Mr. Gu Jisheng, a standing committee member of the society, reported that he had personally investigated the situation and the tragic disaster was shocking. Those who have a heart to save the world, what should they think about this?</p>
<h3>Autonomous Training Institute Student Conference</h3>
<p>The Student Association of the Municipal Local Autonomy Training Institute held an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at Changshe yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. All committee members attended, and Tian Heqing was elected chairman and Ding Shoutang was elected recorder. After the meeting commenced as usual, the chairman reported the significance of convening the meeting and then began to discuss the proposals. (1) The city's autonomy is nominally curtailed, but in reality, it has been suspended. How should we express our opinion? The resolution is as follows: (1) Telegraph the Executive Yuan to order the municipal government to promptly establish district offices to handle autonomy below the district level. (2) Send representatives to petition the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters. (3) (Confidential). (4) Send representatives to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior. (5) Schedule a special student congress to discuss coping methods. The meeting adjourned after the discussions. The association's express mail to Nanjing Executive Yuan President Wang Xunjian regarding the suspension of Shanghai's autonomy preparatory committee states: "We are deeply shocked and surprised that the association's preparatory funds and all preparatory work have been completed. The investigation, elections, and various printed materials are piled up like mountains, costing over 100,000 yuan. Now, the autonomy work has suddenly been suspended, which is a waste of effort. Your Excellency has always attached great importance to autonomy and has repeatedly published statements, recognizing that handling autonomy is the only way to secure internal stability. We hereby telegraph Your Excellency to promptly order the Shanghai Municipal Government to promptly establish district offices to handle autonomy below the district level. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. The Student Association of the Shanghai Local Autonomy Training Institute respectfully kowtows."</p>
<h3>Foreign Fishing Vessels Coming to China</h3>
<p>Anti-Dumping Duties Will Be Heavily Levied</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese fishing boats have come to China to fish overseas, becoming more and more frequent. Recently, they have intensified their efforts. In addition to dumping the fish they catch in China, they are also transporting large quantities of fish from Japan to China for dumping. Taking Shanghai as an example, tens of thousands of dan of Japanese fish are transported each month, causing our country's fishing industry to be excluded and in imminent danger. As for the government's remedial measures, according to news from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it will implement the collection of anti-dumping duties on foreign fishing vessels to resist. As for the collection method, no concrete decision has been made yet. Since last year, the customs has levied a regular tax of four yuan per dan on imported foreign fish. Unexpectedly, this year's fishing season is very prosperous, and Russian fish imports have also increased, so Japanese fish have greatly reduced prices for dumping, making it impossible for domestic fish to resist. If anti-dumping duties on foreign fish are not heavily levied, the future of domestic fish is unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Record of the Continued Trial of the China Merchants' Bureau Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Police Officer Li Guojie Escorted to Court</p>
<p>Li Confesses That Chen Took Away 700,000</p>
<p>Dou Yaoting Testifies That He Does Not Know the Details</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the general manager of the China Merchants' Bureau, was accused of borrowing foreign debt, embezzling, breaching trust, and harming the interests of the bureau, as well as bribing Chen Fumu, the supervisor, with 700,000 taels. The Shanghai District Court sentenced him to three years in prison. He appealed, and the High Court, led by Lin Zhezhang, presiding judge of the Criminal Division One, judges Fang Wen and Si Wen, prosecutor Chen Guifen, and clerks Qian Zemin and Li Wang, came to Shanghai and temporarily used the First Tribunal of the Shanghai District Court for the trial. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM was the time for the continuation of the trial. Li Guojie still retained defense lawyers Zhang Yipeng, Sha Xunyi, and Jiang Yiping, while Liu Hongsheng, the current general manager of the China Merchants' Bureau, retained lawyer Wang Youling to represent him due to the 700,000 yuan. Wang was not present, and lawyer Liu Zhen acted as a substitute. After the judge opened the court, police chief Chen Junfang, police officers Chen Xihui and Zhu Wenqing, and others escorted Li to the court from the Shanghai Hospital, helping him up to the courtroom. The judge still allowed Li to sit and give his testimony. The clerk first read aloud the previous testimony, which was the same, and Li was ordered to sign it. Then, the judge (asked) Li Guojie, what do you mean by this letter from the Minister of Transportation? (Answer) I am reporting that the procedures for these 700,000 taels are incomplete, and I have unavoidable hardships. (Question) What hardships? (Answer) After Chen Fumu took the 700,000 taels, he did not hand them over during the handover, and he did not give them to the relief office. I was very anxious. (Question) When the money was handed over that day, Dou Yaoting brought the money, and Huang Jusu brought the contract. Did you handle most of it? (Answer) Because the supervisor said that when doing business with foreigners, it is necessary to pay an advance, so after negotiating with the business company two weeks ago, the supervisor said that this payment must be kept by him, otherwise, he was afraid that the China Merchants' Bureau would be too poor and it would be used for other purposes. (Question) Where is Wang Yunzhang now? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Where did Huang Jusu go? (Answer) I don't know. Wang Yunzhang was my English secretary. (Question) Dou Yaoting, you are 45 years old, from Ningbo, and live at 70 Sichuan Road. The China Business Company does real estate business. (Question) Today you are here as a witness, you must tell the truth. After he signed an affidavit, he was again (asked) Who is your manager? (Answer) Sadeli (Question) Was the 700,000 advance paid to you? (Answer) Yes. (Question) What kind of money was it? (Answer) It was what the head clerk said was paid to the China Merchants' Bureau. (Question) What did he say at the time? (Answer) I don't know, but I sent the money and took the receipt back. (Question) Did he explain it to you? (Answer) He said that the deposit was sent. (Question) Did you talk about it with the manager before? (Answer) This was probably known to the old manager (old Sadeli), we didn't know. (Question) What was the 700,000? (Answer) Presented bank notes, a total of fourteen, eleven of which were silver. (Question) I want to ask you where you handed the money over. (Answer) The office under the China Merchants' Bureau. (Question) Who did you hand it over to? (Answer) To Mr. Li. (Question) How did you hand it to him? (Answer) As soon as I went, he knew, and after taking the payment, he gave me a receipt, which was in foreign characters and had a seal. I saw that it was correct, so I left. He told me to give me a package, saying that the contract had been taken back. I didn't look at the contents either. (Question) If it wasn't a contract, wouldn't you have looked at it? (Answer) Because the old manager didn't tell me, so after giving me a package, I didn't look into it. (Question) Did anyone else come? (Answer) Many people came and went. (Question) Do you know Huang Jusu? (Answer) There is such a person, whom I met three years ago when he came to the company for other business. I don't know if it's the same person. (Question) Did Huang Jusu meet you when you paid the money that day? (Answer) I didn't pay attention. (Question) Was Wang Yunzhang there? (Answer) This is Mr. Li's English secretary, I know him, but I didn't see him that day. I left in a hurry. (Question) After Li Guojie received the 700,000, who did he give it to? (Answer) I didn't see that. (Question) What time was it that day? (Answer) Four o'clock in the afternoon on September 13th. (Question) What is the nature of Sassoon &amp; Co.? (Answer) They specialize in lending money and don't do retail business. They have another Mercari Bank. (Question) Did Sadeli come? (Answer) He didn't come. At this point, (asked again) Li Guojie, what is the interest rate on the 700,000 taels? (Answer) It is calculated from the date of receipt. (Question) Has the contract been cancelled now? (Answer) I heard it has been cancelled. The judge again (asked) Mai Yaoting, (Answer) I heard that a draft agreement has been signed for cancellation, according to newspaper reports. After the interrogation, the judge ordered that the trial continue at 1:00 PM on the 29th of this month and ordered Dou to accompany Sadeli to the court for questioning on the 29th or 30th. Then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Never-Ending Sheng Family Property Dispute</h3>
<p>Li Sheng Yuju Accuses Yu You of Property Division</p>
<p>The Inheritance Is Harmful To Such An Extreme</p>
<p>The Sheng family of Wujin, residing in Shanghai, has a large number of descendants, but since Sheng Xingsun and his wife Zhuang successively passed away, the children of each branch have been engaged in repeated litigation over the inheritance of millions of dollars of ancestral property, which was unevenly distributed. Litigation has become even more intense since 1927. One case is not settled, and another arises, which can be described as the champion of litigation in Shanghai. To this day, there are still cases pending in the First Special District Court. Unexpectedly, lawsuits have been heard again. Sheng Xingsun had five sons, Kuichen, Aichen, Zechen, Panchen, and Pinchen, and four daughters. Aichen died in 1919 and had no children during his lifetime. Therefore, in 1915, Sheng Yuju, the daughter of Kuichen's eldest son, was married to the Li family of Hefei as a daughter-in-law. After Aichen died, the clan adopted Zechen's son Yu You to succeed him because he had no heirs. However, the property left by Sheng Xingsun at the time of his death, in addition to being divided by the sons, also included a minister's payment to establish the Yuzhai Charity Estate. In 1927, the National Revolutionary Army recovered Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the capital was established in Nanjing. At that time, the trend of confiscating the property of corrupt local tyrants was very prevalent, and the descendants of the Sheng family took out 60% of the Charity Estate's property for equal distribution among the five sons and four daughters. Aichen's one-ninth share was inherited by his adopted son Yu You. Later, the property left by Sheng's wife Zhuang was divided, and Aichen's share of approximately 70,000 yuan was also inherited by Yu You. At that time, Wang Shengrong, the concubine daughter of Kuichen, had already married into the Wang family, and she was involved in litigation with Yu You. Rong claimed that she was Aichen's adopted daughter and should inherit Aichen's property. Although Yu You objected, the First Special Court had already ruled in favor of Wang Shengrong. Because it has not been completely determined, whether another wave can be launched is still unknown. Now, Li Sheng Yuju has again retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Yu You for property division. It is claimed that Sheng Yuju is in fact Aichen's adopted daughter. Aichen's share of (1) one-ninth of the Yuzhai Charity Estate's property and (2) 70,000 yuan of Lady Zhuang's inheritance should be divided into three shares, and Sheng Yuju should receive one-third. It is requested that Yu You hand over the property and divide it according to law, and Wang Shengrong is listed as the second defendant. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special Court opened a hearing. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in person, and each was represented by their attorneys. The plaintiff's lawyer first stated the intent of the prosecution and then presented the gift list from the plaintiff's wedding, Sheng Xingsun's handwritten note, and the letter from his eldest grandson Sheng Yucheng as evidence, and requested that Yucheng and Sheng Linhuai, the brigade commander of the Sheng family, be summoned to court for questioning. The lawyers for the two defendants then made statements in turn. The defendant completely denied the plaintiff's claims. As for the two witnesses that the plaintiff requested to summon, the defendant also found it difficult to agree because Yucheng was the plaintiff's elder brother, and Linhuai had voluntarily testified in court in another case, but he requested benefits, which the defendant refused. Therefore, the defendant could not believe his testimony this time. Judge Luo ruled that the case still required investigation and adjourned the hearing to the 13th of this month.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Adultery After Divorce</h3>
<p>Tang Zhixiang Still Wants to Exercise Spousal Rights</p>
<p>Jiang Youqing Reserves the Right to Counterclaim for False Accusation</p>
<p>Tang Zhixiang, a 27-year-old Chongming native who works as a sock weaver at the Xinghua Sock Factory at 37, the intersection of Tokyo Road and Putuo Road in the western district of the Public Concession, married Huang Xiuying (23 years old this year), a woman from his hometown, two years ago in his hometown. After the marriage, he brought her to Shanghai, where they worked and lived in the same sock factory. Initially, their love was strong, but later, Tang wandered around and spent money extravagantly, abusing his wife, which led to a breakdown in their affection. On February 17th of the lunar calendar this spring, the couple voluntarily agreed to divorce, with the woman compensating the man 245 yuan. They drew up a written agreement, each holding a copy as proof, which stated that the man and woman could marry separately and would not interfere with each other. After Xiuying divorced Tang, she met Jiang Youqing, a 29-year-old from the same hometown and industry, who was not yet married. Through matchmaking, she married Jiang as his wife and married him on March 10th of the lunar calendar. The couple worked together in the Yuda Sock Factory at 19 Dongning Lane, Jiaxini Road, in the French Concession, and lived together in the factory's workshop. Recently, Tang Zhixiang, Xiuying's ex-husband, learned that Xiuying had been seduced into adultery by Jiang when they worked in the same factory and that she was now married and living with him. He couldn't help but feel jealous and burned with anger. He filed a petition with the Conciliation Office of the Second Special District Court, citing Article 1337 of the Civil Code, which states that men and women who have committed adultery cannot marry, requesting conciliation to prevent Jiang and Huang from living together and claiming that their marriage was invalid. After summoning both parties for a hearing, conciliation failed. Tang then filed a criminal petition with the Second Special Court, lodging a private prosecution under Article 256 of the Criminal Code, accusing Jiang Youqing and Huang Xiuying of consensual adultery and requesting an investigation. The court approved the petition. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian summoned the defendants and their defense attorney Gong Yiren to court in Criminal Division Two. First, the plaintiff, Tang Zhixiang, said, "I married Huang Xiuying and came to Shanghai together to weave socks. She was seduced by Jiang Youqing, who worked in the same factory, and forced me to divorce. Because Xiuying married Jiang Youqing after divorcing me, I filed a lawsuit to prevent her. If she marries someone else, I will definitely not interfere." The two defendants denied having committed adultery in the past. The judge then explained to the plaintiff, "Your citation of Article 1337 of the Civil Code to prevent them from marrying is a civil matter and should be filed in the civil court, not in the criminal court. Now you are accusing them of Article 256 of the Criminal Code, which is seducing a married woman and is punishable by imprisonment for up to two years. Now that you are divorced from her, you have no spousal rights. She is an unmarried woman, and you have no right to control her." The defendant's lawyer then made a defense. The defendant also requested to reserve the right to counterclaim against the plaintiff for false accusation, etc. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentence for the morning of May 31st and adjourned the court. During the trial of this case, relatives and friends of both parties were present in court, numbering nearly a hundred people. After the interrogation, they all rushed out in a crowd.</p>
<h3>Longmen Alumni Association Established Today</h3>
<p>The junior high school of Shanghai Middle School on Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, was originally the site of the Longmen Academy. Since the academy system was abolished, the Longmen Normal School was established on its site. For thirty years, the Longmen Normal School was reorganized into the Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School, and then the Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School was reorganized into the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School Normal Department. Although personnel have changed several times, the spirit remains consistent. Recently, the alumni of the Longmen Second Normal School and the Normal Department of Shanghai Middle School initiated the organization of the Longmen Alumni Association. It has been approved for establishment by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters and has been prepared. It has also been approved and filed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. The inaugural meeting will be held today (the 28th) at 2:00 PM in the junior high school of Shanghai Middle School on Shangwen Road. Party and government organs have sent personnel to guide and supervise, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Zheng Xigu have been invited to give speeches at the meeting. A film will be shown and a dinner will be held that evening to strengthen friendship. It is reported that the alumni and faculty of the former Longmen Normal School, Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School, and Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School Normal Department number around 1,800. A grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<h3>Forty-One Reactionaries</h3>
<p>Escorted to Suzhou for Trial</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau successively cracked down on 41 reactionaries, including Wu Zhen, and transferred them to the District Court. Lou Ying, the Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, submitted the cases one by one for separate investigation. It was found that in addition to committing the crime of obstructing official duties, the defendants were also suspected of reactionary activities such as endangering the Republic of China. Therefore, with the approval of the Jiangsu Higher Court Procuratorate, all bailiffs were dispatched on the afternoon of the previous day, and two inspectors from the Public Security Bureau led police officers to bring out the 41 defendants, including Wu Zhen, and escorted them on the Shanghai-Nanjing express train to Suzhou to be submitted to the Higher Court Procuratorate for detention pending trial.</p>
<h3>Shenglong Steamer Sinks Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>After the Hetae Company's He'an transport was sunk by a Norwegian merchant ship near the Guanghua Oil Depot in Gaoqiao, the sunken ship and cargo have been salvaged by the customs. Work began on the previous day and is still in progress. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, a small steamer accidentally touched the He'an sunken ship, causing a yellow croaker fishing boat to sink. The details of this situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Accidental Collision with Sunken Ship</h3>
<p>At around 12:00 AM yesterday morning, a small steamer named Shenglong was towing a yellow croaker fishing boat, intending to sail out of the Wusong estuary. It was heard that the yellow croakers inside the boat were goods from Qiu. When the Shenglong steamer was traveling near the Guanghua Oil Depot in Gaoqiao, it was late at night, and the helmsman was careless, causing him to mistakenly change direction. Its hull crashed into the already sunken He'an ship. In a hurry, the helmsman feared that he would cause a major disaster, so he quickly reversed the engine, causing the bow of the ship to hit the sunken ship and the stern to damage the fishing boat, resulting in a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Sinks</h3>
<p>When the Shenglong reversed, it did so at excessive speed, and the bow of the ship struck a large hole in the bow of the yellow croaker fishing boat that was being towed at the stern. The damaged area was at the waterline, causing the fishing boat's bow cabin to immediately flood, and the entire boat sank into the Gaoqiao sand river in an instant. The cargo and the hull were completely lost.</p>
<h3>Steamer Flees</h3>
<p>After the fishing boat was hit and had an accident, the captain of the Shenglong steamer realized that he had caused a major disaster and wanted to evade responsibility. He took the opportunity to untie the tow rope and secretly sailed towards Wusong. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the customs water patrol discovered that the small steamer had collided with the fishing boat and learned that the steamer's hull had also been damaged. It is now hidden in Wusong for repairs. The water patrol has summoned the captain of the steamer to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the matter.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Efforts to Prevent Epidemics</h3>
<p>Four More Injection Stations Established</p>
<p>And Preparing to Build Isolation Hospital</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau's summer health work began on May 1st. Due to the inconsistent weather, the number of people suffering from colds and epidemics is increasing, so it has stepped up its work since the previous day and has established four more injection stations in Nanshi and Zhabei to make it easier for citizens to get vaccinated. The bureau is also preparing to build an isolation hospital to facilitate group injections. Any group or large number of citizens who need injections can notify the bureau by telegram, and the bureau will send doctors to inject them. As for the bureau's preparations for an isolation hospital, they are also in the planning stages.</p>
<h3>Grains Industry</h3>
<p>Notice to Grain Merchants to Improve Domestic Wheat</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Trade Association Wheat Group yesterday respectfully informed fellow traders and vendors in various producing areas that since China established itself as a nation based on agriculture, the abundance of its products has been renowned around the globe, and the country should be rich and the people strong, competing with Europe and the United States. However, farmers have been clinging to old ways, not seeking to improve, resulting in a decline in product quality and a decrease in production. In the past two years, the annual import of foreign rice has reached more than 10 million bags, and the huge loss is not to be mentioned. In recent years, the annual import of foreign wheat has also been around 10 million bags. Ignoring the great financial cost, it flows out steadily. This is because domestic wheat products are of inferior quality, and rural farmers and vendors fill them with mud and make them counterfeit in order to make petty profits, which eventually leads flour mills to shy away from them. On the other hand, foreign wheat products are of good quality and have no damp fluff or impurities, so it is no wonder that factories unanimously tend to use foreign wheat and discard domestic wheat. If this continues without any attempt to remedy the situation, flour mills will almost be unable to grind without foreign wheat, and Chinese people will not want to use anything but foreign wheat. The flowing water is endless, when can it be stopped? It can be seen that the livelihood of farmers and vendors will be destroyed, and all Chinese people cannot but be worried. The members of this group are engaged in miscellaneous grains and are in fear, so they dare not be self-effacing and plan for ways to rectify the situation. However, this matter is of great importance and depends on the wisdom and efforts of everyone. It is hoped that fellow traders in the country will catch up quickly and urge farmers and vendors in the producing areas to earnestly rectify the situation and no longer fill wheat products with water and mud, thereby demeaning themselves. They must fundamentally realize the need for thorough reform. Those who stubbornly cling to old habits should be sanctioned. In this way, there is hope for the improvement of domestic products, manufacturers will have no worries about discarding them, and the source of foreign wheat can be cut off without resorting to resistance. Maintaining domestic products and blocking loopholes will also be supported by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Chinese Association Re-elects Executive and Supervisory Committee</h3>

The association's annual meeting last year resolved to hold the general election of overseas Chinese at home and abroad on July 1st. Now, according to the order of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, the election of members in Shanghai will be held in advance, and Mr. Luo Ciqi has been specially appointed as the election supervisor. Mr. Luo has already arrived in Shanghai and has agreed with the association's re-election committee to elect one-third first, and the remaining two-thirds will wait for the overseas elections. The election of members in Shanghai will be held at the association's auditorium at 1:00 PM on Monday, the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>The First Day of the Kun Opera Performance</h3>
<p>The Kun Opera Preservation Society, on the evenings of the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month, held a Kunqu opera performance at the Lake Society of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall on Beijing Road to raise funds for the Xian Dian Opera Troupe. They specially invited famous figures from the Jiangzhe opera circles to perform together. I entered the venue at seven o'clock yesterday and found it already quite crowded, which shows the appeal of the event. The first play was *The Chain Scheme: Small Banquet*, with Yu Zhenfei playing Lü Bu, Zhang Zhaochun playing Wang Yun, and He Jianmei playing Diao Chan. Yu and Zhang are veteran performers in the opera world, and Ms. He is said to be performing for the first time, but her deportment was graceful and her appearance beautiful. The ensemble of this play was well-matched, making it even more splendid. Next was *Sweeping the Flowers* by Xu Yuanlai and Ge Qifu. Mr. Xu played Lü Dongbin with a calm and composed demeanor, and he has clearly studied the pronunciation and enunciation of the words. It is said that his singing, recitation, and acting styles have all been corrected by Yu Zhenfei, truly a worthy student of a great teacher. Mr. Ge's He Gu was also quite fitting. Next was Wang Fumin's *Dream of Infatuation*. Mr. Wang's *zhengdan* role is one of the most talented in the current opera world. The *zhengdan* in Kunqu opera is equivalent to the *qingyi* in Erhuang opera, and one must possess both beautiful voice and appearance to play it well. Mr. Wang has just returned from Beiping and generously joined the performance to promote Kunqu opera, a feast for our eyes. Mr. Wang's singing and acting have reached perfection, so there is no need for me to add further praise. Next was *The Shepherd's Tale: Longing for Home*, with Xu Liecheng playing Su Wu. He is the son of the opera veteran, Mr. Shou Xun. His voice was loud and clear, and his acting was also well-regulated. The person playing Li Ling was the owner of Yun Song Hall; his name is unknown, but I felt that his deportment and singing had many commendable points. Next was Qin Tongli's *Borrowing Tea*, his attitude was elegant and his comedic timing pleasing. Liu Tingsun played Xu Jizu, looking every bit the young dandy. Paired with Zhang Zhaochun's nanny, it was even more lively. *Combing Hair and Kneeling at the Pond* featured Xu Muyan playing Lü Bu. Mr. Xu has studied Kunqu opera for decades and is known throughout the north and south of the country. Paired with Ye Xiaohong's Diao Chan, it was even more cohesive. De Tian Jushi's *Marrying Off a Younger Sister* had a vibrant demeanor and extraordinary presence. Qin Wangjie's Meier and Qin Tongli's Du Ping were also very well-matched. Next was *The Jade Hairpin: Asking about Illness and Stealing Poetry*, with Zhang Weiru and Xue Yujin both playing Pan Bizheng, both elegant and romantic, and touching to the heart. Qin Wangjie's Guan Zhou Chang had a clear and bright voice and was originally a capable performer. The final act was *The Palace of Eternal Life: Burying Jade*, with Yu Zhenfei as Emperor Tang Ming, Xu Deyi as Chen Yuanli, and Zhang Zhaochun as Gao Lishi, all concentrating and giving their best, a truly outstanding performance.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Murder: Apprehended</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, while inspecting pedestrians in the Shiliupu area yesterday morning, encountered Chen Baoxing from Shaoxing, who was passing by. The detectives found his behavior suspicious and searched him. They found a pistol and one hundred bullets on his person and took him back to the bureau. Under questioning, they learned that Chen intended to go to No. 12, Jianli Lane, Huayi Street, to murder Yan Yongxiao, the director of the Zhejiang Nan Dian Industry Shanghai Joint Office. He also confessed that the motive for this murder was instigated by six people from Shaoxing: Yao Azhang, Yang Dahua, Zhang Jinshan, Zhang Jinshui, and others, who promised to pay him 1,200 yuan as a reward. The gun and bullets were given to him by the two Zhangs, he said. After obtaining the confession, detectives led by team leaders Gao Wansheng and Sun Caifu, along with Chinese detectives Bu Zongting and others from the Old Zhabei and French Concession police stations, arrested the two Zhangs and Yao and Yang at No. 8 Yulin Lane, Suzhou Road, and Room 36 of the Zhonghe Hotel on Fuzhou Road. They were taken back to the police station for detention and escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division this morning. The Public Security Bureau requested that the four suspects be transferred to them for interrogation. Chen was then brought to court, and his testimony was the same as in the Public Security Bureau. The four defendants all denied the charges. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that the Public Security Bureau already had substantial evidence proving that the four defendants were suspected of committing a crime, so the police station did not object to the transfer. Criminal Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confessions and ruled that Yao, Yang, and the two Zhangs should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau's representatives for investigation and trial.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Policeman</h3>
<p>Qijin Bao Commits Suicide in Resentment</p>
<p>Due to disagreement with the Shop Owner</p>
<p>Qi Duobao, a 37-year-old Shandong native who worked as a gatekeeper policeman for a Westerner at No. 360 Haig Road, had served diligently for several years. He had disagreements with the shop owner, Gu Yuanmeng, and had several verbal altercations. Recently, Gu suspected Qi of stealing clothes, but Qi suffered this injustice and had nowhere to turn. He was also deeply afraid that the matter would be known to his employer, which would affect his job and reputation. He was extremely worried and unhappy and eventually developed suicidal thoughts. The day before yesterday, he stabbed himself in the neck and chest with scissors in his bedroom, causing severe injuries. He fell to the ground and died from excessive blood loss. His colleague, Liu Qinghe, caught sight of him and tried to dissuade him, but it was too late. He reported to the Westerner, who in turn reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. When the detectives arrived, Qi had already died from his injuries. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court arrived at the morgue to investigate. According to the complaint filed by the deceased's cousin, Hou Shaotang, the deceased's family was all in his hometown, so he dared not arrange for the coffin and burial. However, a few days ago, the deceased had come to his place to talk about the quarrel with Gu, and his words revealed resentment and unbearable feelings. At the time, I tried to dissuade him, and he went back immediately. I did not expect that he would suddenly commit suicide, he said. Mr. Guo reviewed the confession and ruled that the deceased, Qi Jinbao, had indeed committed suicide by stabbing himself with scissors. The body was handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Two Cars Collide</h3>
<p>Western Woman in Car Leaves</p>
<p>Empty Car Taken to Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th) around 10 a.m., a collision occurred at the intersection of Zhengjia Wood Street and Bulin Lane on Avenue Edward VII. Car No. 7794, traveling from west to east (with a Western woman sitting inside), and Car No. 7480 (empty car), traveling from east to west, collided due to the driver's carelessness. As a result, the front bumper of Car No. 7794 was broken, and the front of Car No. 7480 was damaged, and a tire burst. The police arrived and recorded the numbers of both cars. Except for Car No. 7794, which continued on its way because a Western woman was sitting inside, Car No. 7480 was taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Third Recruitment by the YMCA</h3>
<p>607 Members Recruited, 16,449 Points in Dues</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's 33rd membership drive's first two announcements of achievements have already been published. Last night (the 27th) at 5 p.m. was the third announcement. The total number of members recruited in the three announcements was 607, with a total of 16,449 points in dues. The top three teams with the most points in this period are: (1) Team 49, led by Su Shi-san, with 52 members and 1184 points; (2) Team 17, led by Pan Xu-lun, with 30 members and 707 points; (3) Team 9, led by Cao Yun-xiang, with 1 member and 490 points. Although the goal is still far away, since the emergency meeting held on the 24th at the residence of the chief commander, Mr. Kong Yong-zhi, the team leaders have been extremely motivated and determined to succeed. According to the YMCA's experience in membership recruitment, success usually comes in the last five minutes. Now that the team leaders and members are so motivated, the satisfactory result in the future is foreseeable.</p>
<h3>New Convertible Notes Issued by the China Industrial Bank</h3>
<p>Divided into One Yuan, Five Yuan, and Ten Yuan Denominations</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank in this city has printed new convertible notes in three denominations: one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. They have already been issued in the city and are slightly different in style from the previous convertible notes. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Cigarette and Exchange Industry Guild, stating: "We have printed new convertible notes, which will be used together with the convertible notes already issued in the market. However, the style is slightly different, so we are sending a sample of the new one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan notes for your guild to inspect and store for verification." After receiving the letter, the guild has notified all cigarette and exchange businesses.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Arrests Pan Zinian</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: A foreign newspaper in this city recently reported that plainclothes agents of the Chinese Public Security Bureau forcibly arrested the writers Ding Ling and Pan Zinian in the Public Concession using abduction methods, and there were rumors that they had already been executed by the Public Security Bureau. Wanting to understand the truth of this matter, the reporter specially visited a person in charge of the Public Security Bureau yesterday to inquire. According to him, Pan Zinian was indeed arrested at 11 a.m. on the 14th of this month in the Chinese territory north of Xinqiao Bridge, Shanbanchang, Zhabei. Pan is the secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and the chief editor of the party's journal, *The Truth*. The evidence is conclusive. After being arrested, he was transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the competent authority for strict interrogation and has not been executed. As for Ding Zhen, the Public Security Bureau has not arrested her. The facts reported by a certain newspaper are completely unfounded. As for the claim of abduction methods being used for the arrest, it is close to being a joke. The Public Security Bureau has always received sincere assistance from the Concession Police Department when arresting important Communist Party criminals in the Concession. This has been proven by past facts, so why would they need to use secret tactics? This is recorded to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Policeman Assaults Vendor</h3>
<p>Ningbo Association Sends Letter to French Consul-General Requesting Punishment</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports: The Ningbo Association stated yesterday that they received a report from a fellow townsman, Zhang Wang, stating that her son, Zhang Yu-gao, was selling water chestnuts on Caishe Street in the French Concession when he was violently assaulted and injured by Vietnamese policeman No. 198. His injuries were severe, and she requested redress. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent a letter to the French Concession police authorities, requesting that justice be upheld. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, according to the statement made to our association by our fellow townsman, Zhang Wang, she was born unlucky, her husband died fifteen years ago, leaving behind a son, Yu-gao, who was born posthumously. Because the family has no land, they rely on the No. 164 permit obtained in the French Concession Caishe Street, where her son, Yu-gao, sells green vegetables and water chestnuts to make a living. Unfortunately, at around 8 a.m. on the 27th of this month, her son, Yu-gao, had water chestnuts which he had sold from Xiaodongmen and brought to the Caishe Street to sell, when Vietnamese policeman No. 198 came, stepped on the water chestnuts with his feet, accused him of selling without a permit, and without any explanation, kicked and punched him, relying on his barbarity and acting violently. Yu-gao was injured, fell to the ground, and vomited blood. Passersby, seeing this, felt indignant. The Vietnamese policeman then brandished his gun in a threatening manner and swaggered away. By the time his mother rushed over, Yu-gao was still bleeding. They went to the Dada Zimin Bell Police Station to file a complaint. Although the son was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, the injuries have not subsided, and recently he has been urinating blood. If something unfortunate happens, how will they live? He came to us and asked us to find a way to help. After investigation, we found that the vendor holds the No. 164 permit and operates a stall legally. The Vietnamese policeman No. 198 acted arbitrarily and violently, kicking and beating Zhang Yu-gao and injuring him. The tragedy on Xinqiao Street has just passed, and the bloodshed in Caishe Street has begun again. The lives of citizens are not guaranteed at all. In addition to sending Zhang Yu-gao to the Blue Cross Hospital for treatment, we hereby request that Your Consul General pay attention to the illegal behavior of the Vietnamese policemen under your command, impose appropriate punishment on No. 198, and provide compensation for the victim's damages, in order to seek justice. We hope that you will investigate and reply. Respectfully, to the French Concession Police Department's Consul-General."</p>
<h3>Bandits Conspire to Rob Gold Bars in Hotel</h3>
<p>Detectives Arrest Them After Receiving Information</p>
<p>One of the Old Bandits is Sixty Years Old</p>
<p>Sentenced Yesterday After Trial</p>
<p>Shang Wu, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Di Siwei Road Police Station, detectives Liu Decheng, and others, arrested three bandits from Taizhou, Chen Xibao; Xuzhou, Li Zhiliang; and Zhuang Fuchen, in Room 50 of the Anle Hotel at No. 321 North Zhejiang Road at 11 p.m. on the 18th of this month. They confiscated one blunderbuss and forty-six bullets and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen of the Special Court continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tian-yin, stated that the case was being rescheduled. According to the defendant Chen Xibao, he had previously discussed with Li Baochuan, who is still at large, and Li Zhiliang in a tea house in Caishe Street in the French Concession, intending to rob 21 gold bars worth a considerable sum of money from the Qingfu Shenzhuang Transport Company at No. 7, Liugui Lane, North Zhejiang Road. The gold bars had recently been smuggled from Hankou to Shanghai and were tax-evaded goods. This information was provided by Li Baochuan, so they went to the hotel, opened a room, and Li Zhiliang brought the guns and bullets for use. It was agreed at the time to go to rob at 7 a.m. on the 19th, entering through the side door of the company. Therefore, the defendant secretly went to the company in advance to identify the location, so as not to make a mistake. During the robbery, Chen Xibao was responsible for guarding the hotel room. However, Li Zhiliang claimed that he had picked up the guns and bullets on Baoshan Road during the Shanghai war, wrapped them in paper, and hid them in a tomb. He brought them to the hotel that day in order to sell them to Li Baochuan. However, Zhuang Fuchen flatly denied any involvement in the case. He only admitted that he was involved in the case of robbing Xu Yutang of 3,200 yuan in paper money that he was carrying on Xinzha Road around 8 a.m. on October 18 of last year, and said that at that time, Chen Xibao lived in Hongkou, and Zhuang Fuchen went to invite him to go to rob together, but he refused. Afterwards, the leader, surnamed Wang, told Zhuang to bring him 20 yuan, because he knew that he had asked him not to reveal it, but Zhuang swallowed it, etc. The above situation was all confessed by Chen Xibao, so he added a charge. It was found that Li Zhiliang and Zhuang Fuchen were soldiers under Sun Chuanfang. Today, the injured parties have not arrived. The police station believes that Chen Xibao's confession is credible and should be punished according to law. As for the Mauser gun presented in the case, since it has the Public Security Bureau's mark, it should also be returned. Chen Xibao then confessed the previous situation (the defendant was already sixty years old and looked very pitiful). Afterwards, the police station's lawyer stated that the defendant had fully confessed and was not without cause for sympathy, requesting that he be dealt with leniently. Li and Zhuang, the two defendants, gave evasive confessions. After Judge Xiao reviewed the confessions, he sentenced Chen Xibao to eight months in prison, and Li Zhiliang and Zhuang Fuchen to one year and six months each. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined was allowed to be offset at a rate of two days for one day. The guns and bullets were stored in the warehouse, waiting to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for collection.</p>

<h3>More than Sixty Companies in the City</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Capital Reduction in the Hat-Making Industry</p>
<p>Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday Morning Was Unresolved</p>
<p>More than sixty hat factories in this city, including Dong Hua Sheng, Xu Yi Yuan, and Xu Wei Ji, reduced the wages stipulated in the labor-management contracts due to the impact of the current situation, ranging from 40% to 60% of the original wage, causing opposition from more than three hundred workers. The Hat Makers' Union has requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate, but the matter has not yet been resolved. The union believes that the straw hat season is coming to an end and that the delay will endanger the workers' livelihoods. Therefore, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, it sent representatives Wang Yu-xiang, Zhou Zhi-qing, Zhao Ting-ting, and Ding Song-wan, along with more than forty other people, to the Social Affairs Bureau again to request a speedy mediation. Yan Pei of the Third Section received them. The bureau had scheduled a mediation session for 10 a.m., ordering the workers to attend at that time to make statements. At 10 a.m., Wang Yu-xiang and Zhao Ting-ting from the labor side and Le Rui-sheng and Xu Neng-yu from the management side arrived. Section member Tan Pei-yan of the Third Section chaired the meeting. After persuasion, the labor side agreed to reduce the discount from 10% to 8.5%, with a minimum of 80%. However, the management side could not agree, resulting in another fruitless outcome. The representative of the Social Affairs Bureau stated that the wage rates of the various factories were inconsistent and that a survey of the wage rates of the various factories must first be conducted to create an average standard. The meeting was rescheduled for 10 a.m. next Saturday, still at the bureau. During this period, both parties will try to reconcile outside the bureau.</p>
<h3>Municipal Hospital to Start Construction Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the lack of a large-scale municipal hospital with complete facilities in the city, has decided to establish a municipal hospital in the downtown area to benefit the citizens. The land has already been designated in the downtown area, covering more than eighty mu. As for the hospital's facilities and building designs, they have also been completed by the bureau and submitted to Mayor Wu Tiecheng for approval. Funds will be allocated in the budget next year for construction. As for the establishment of a municipal hospital in Zhabei, it cannot be realized for the time being due to limited funding.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Commercial Community Retains the Director of the Ship Donation Office</h3>
<p>Jiang Nantong, Director of the Wusong Ship Donation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, has been in office for two years, rectifying tax donations on the one hand and caring for poor ship merchants on the other. He has won the sympathy of all industries and businesses in Songzhen. This time, upon hearing the news of his transfer, all of them were reluctant to let him go. Yesterday, more than forty businesses, including the Songzhen Rice Industry, Ground Goods Industry, Fish Industry, and Southern Goods Industry, jointly sealed and submitted a petition to Zhang Yuru, Director of the Wusong Branch of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking him to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which in turn would ask the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Finance to withdraw the order of transfer, so as to take both reason and sentiment into account, and to protect the happiness of the ship merchants.</p>

<h3>如何讀書的問題 (The Question of How to Read)</h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Wen of Yangzhou:</p>
<p>I have a matter to consult with you... I believe that the current world is shrouded in economic imbalance. Strong and weak nations alike are experiencing great unrest. International conflicts are becoming increasingly sharp. A second tragedy is bound to happen. This cause-and-effect relationship is worth exploring, and a reasonable future organization is even more worth studying. Domestically, however, the violent are breaking into homes, and politics remain dark. Partition and annexation are both possible. Moreover, the social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and starving people are ready to revolt. External troubles are indeed cause for concern, but internal turmoil is even more frightening. How can we achieve domestic peace, and how can we repel foreign aggression? This poses a serious problem.</p>
<p>Political and economic studies have always been my forte. However, during my university years, I lacked effective reading methods. Although I studied diligently for several years, my gains were quite superficial. Since entering the workforce, my busy schedule has further prevented me from continuing my exploration. My lack of academic knowledge is a constant source of distress. Worries about the times and the world have only increased my anxiety. Therefore, I have decided to study abroad during the summer to engage in a planned academic pursuit. I am unwilling to squander my hard-earned money, nor am I willing to waste my precious energy. I have drafted a reading plan to proceed step by step, grounded in reality, and to conduct thorough research. However, due to my limited knowledge, I am sure that my draft is full of errors. I specifically request that your column provide guidance, to serve as my compass. I am deeply grateful! The draft reading plan is attached below:</p>
<p>"Draft Reading Plan" - Three years of pre-study in Japan, divided into three stages: Stage 1: Language learning and review of basic knowledge. During this stage, in addition to focusing on language learning, I will select the most important classics and read them periodically according to the following categories: (1) Economics: Principles of Economics, World Economic History, History of Economic Thought, Economic Policy, Current Situation of the World and Chinese Economy. (2) Politics: Political Science and Constitution, World and Chinese Political History, History of Political Thought, International Public and Private Law, Current Status of Politics in Various Countries. (3) Society: Principles of Sociology, Social Trends, Major Social Problems in Various Countries. (4) Finance: Principles of Finance, Financial History of Various Countries, Current Status of Chinese Finance. (5) Principles and Applications of Statistics. Stage 2: Preliminary research: Focus on exploring the following issues: (1) Research on Economic Systems and Economic Organizations; (2) Research on Rural Economy and Rural Society; (3) Research on Land Systems and Tax Policies; (4) Research on World Population and Food Problems; (5) Research on International Economics and Weak Nations; (6) Research on Labor Problems and Factory Management; (7) Research on Municipal Problems and Local Autonomy. During this stage, I should engage in the following activities: (1) Sightseeing in various parts of Japan; (2) Reports on preliminary research; (3) Introduction and translation of famous works. Stage 3: Research on specialized problems: (1) Research Focus: A. Proper allocation of global food and population, and reasonable organization of international economy; B. Relief plans for urban expansion and rural decline; C. Design and implementation of Chinese land distribution and rural construction. (2) Reports on specialized research. During these three years in Japan, I will pay close attention to the following aspects: A. Japanese people and national character; B. Reasons for the success of the Meiji Restoration in Japan; C. Overview of Japanese politics, economy, and society; D. Reasonable solutions to Sino-Japanese problems. After completing the study in Japan, I will immediately engage in two major tasks: (1) Investigation: A. Travel to India, Soviet Russia, and Denmark. B. Observation and work in various rural areas in China. (2) Writing of specialized works.</p>

<h3>Ministry Orders Changes to Elementary and Secondary School Graduation Joint Examinations</h3>
<p>丨Elementary school joint examinations need not be held uniformly 丨Junior high schools can use sampling examination method</p>
<p>Hebei suspends elementary and secondary school joint examinations 丨Hunan Education Department's opinion on curriculum standards</p>
<p>For the past year, the Ministry of Education's promulgation of regulations for joint graduation examinations for elementary and secondary school students has been strictly implemented and tested in various provinces and cities. However, the results are difficult to ascertain. Now, as the summer vacation and the examination period approach, the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities have, based on actual difficulties, submitted requests to the Ministry of Education to change the elementary and secondary school graduation joint examinations and to revise the examination regulations. Such requests are becoming more frequent daily. The Ministry of Education, constrained by the regulations, finds it difficult to approve them. However, the actual difficulties in various provinces and cities cannot be completely dismissed. Therefore, it has taken into account the circumstances of various regions and made appropriate changes. For example, on the 26th, the Ministry of Education telegraphed the Hebei Education Department to temporarily postpone the current elementary and secondary school graduation joint examinations. On the 27th, it approved the Jiangsu Education Department's changes to the elementary school graduation joint examinations in various counties. In addition, the Ministry of Education has approved the Hunan Education Department Director Zhu Jingnong's request to allow sampling examinations for junior high school graduates and to stop holding graduation joint examinations for elementary schools, as well as two points regarding the request to revise the secondary school curriculum standards. The Ministry of Education's original order is recorded below: "Having noted the submission, the Education Department should consider the transportation conditions when conducting the junior high school student graduation joint examination, and divide the areas as much as possible to facilitate the examination. If there are still schools where transportation is obstructed and it is difficult for the students to participate after dividing the areas, then sampling examinations are tentatively allowed. However, detailed sampling examination methods should be strictly defined and submitted to the Ministry for approval before implementation to avoid abuse. Students who fail one or two subjects in the junior high school graduation joint examination shall not be eligible to apply for admission to higher education with graduation qualifications. Those who apply for admission with equivalent academic qualifications will be heard. Regarding the two opinions (attached) submitted regarding the revision of the curriculum, they have been copied and sent to the Curriculum Standards Compilation Committee for Elementary and Secondary Schools for review and to determine the examination subjects. The Ministry has clearly stipulated this in the Interim Regulations on Joint Graduation Examinations for Elementary and Secondary School Students, and it is not appropriate to reduce them. As for elementary school subjects, complete tests may be conducted, or one or two additional subjects may be tested in addition to the prescribed joint examination subjects. Graduation joint examinations for elementary school students should be handled separately as appropriate, but need not be abolished uniformly. The above points should be followed accordingly, and this order is given."</p>
<h3>湘敎廳長請求修改中學課程標準之兩項意見 (Two Opinions from the Hunan Education Department Director Requesting Revision of the Secondary School Curriculum Standards)</h3>
<p>(1) There should be differences in the subjects and content studied by male and female students: "The subjects prescribed for the joint examination, with the exception of English in junior high school, are all subjects stipulated as compulsory in the interim curriculum standards. There is no room for further discussion regarding the joint examination of students in compulsory subjects. However, judging from the results of the previous joint examination, there are significant differences in the achievements of male and female students. Although there are many reasons for this, the question of whether male and female students must study the same curriculum is a matter that urgently needs thorough investigation. According to the current curriculum standards, with the exception of military training and military nursing, the curriculum for all subjects is the same for both male and female students. In terms of intelligence, there is no absolute difference between the two sexes. However, in terms of gender characteristics and needs, it is impossible not to carefully consider whether the two sexes are completely the same. In addition, according to the Educational Objectives and Implementation Guidelines of the Republic of China, 'Women's education must also focus on cultivating sound moral character, maintaining the qualities of motherhood, and building good family and social life.' It follows that women's education should have its own unique qualities. If these qualities are to be cultivated, should there be differences from men in terms of curriculum subjects and content? This should be given attention."</p>
<p>(2) The inappropriateness of not dividing high school students into streams: "In the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, secondary schools had divisions for arts and sciences. When the new education system was implemented in 1923, high school general courses also had two groups, the first and second, to allow students to choose between arts and sciences. After the establishment of the University Council, the high school general course was no longer divided into groups. According to Article 1 of the Secondary School Law, secondary schools prepare students for higher education and employment. From the perspective of higher education, students who go on to higher education should have a considerable understanding of modern scientific knowledge as a foundation for studying advanced knowledge. However, students preparing to enter university arts and science faculties have different aspirations. Should the high school curriculum be adapted separately? From the perspective of employment, should the educational materials for each subject stipulated in the current curriculum standards be necessary for employment after graduation? This should be studied. Current high school students have submitted requests to the Education Department to restore the arts and sciences streaming system."</p>
<p>"The Education Department did not dare to dismiss this outright, so it is specifically submitted for review."</p>
<h3>部院會商檢查電影事宜 (Ministries and Courts Discuss Film Inspection Matters)</h3>

<h3>Recent News from the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>Difficult to Establish by June 1st</p>
<p>The General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts, since the Design Committee elected Gu Shusen and two others to draft the general regulations, recently completed the draft. However, Director Dai Jitao has not returned from the Northwest, making it difficult to review and announce them immediately. The association will be officially established after the general regulations are promulgated. Previous reports that the association would be established on June 1st are impossible to realize. The association will remain at the Lizi Society (not move, as previously reported) until the new headquarters is built. Currently, in China, except for Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang, most provinces and cities have established Boy Scout troops. Roughly, there are already eight hundred and some troops. Jiangsu Province has the most, with nearly two hundred troops. Provinces and cities that have established Boy Scout Provincial Councils (a provincial council can be established if a province has ten county councils) currently include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the cities of Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang's Third Provincial Games Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Competitions Proceeded as Usual in Torrential Rain</p>
<p>Whether Today's Events Can Be Held Depends on the Weather</p>
<p>Seven New Records Created</p>
<p>The third Zhejiang Provincial Games opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the National Games Field in Meidong Gaoqiao, Hangzhou. The sky was overcast and drizzling. During the parade, a school of aviation unexpectedly sent airplanes to circle the air and scatter leaflets, which added to the atmosphere of the venue. However, the audience was not large. The opening speeches were very long. The speeches by the representatives of the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government took a total of three-quarters of an hour. The number of participants in this competition was not large, but there were many groups, which reduced interest. The venue was neatly arranged, and the audience consisted mostly of children and women. All the prizes were displayed on the stage, a feast for the eyes. The perimeter of the field was guarded by male and female student volunteers, as well as soldiers and police, and the order was very good. At the opening in the morning, the sky was overcast and drizzling. By the afternoon, it cleared up and a little sunshine appeared, but it was fleeting. At 3:30 PM, just as the competition was becoming intense, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and torrential rain poured down. The audience scattered to take shelter, but the competition continued as usual. Umbrellas were useless, and the athletes and staff were all soaked to the bone. The rain became heavier and heavier, and the field was flooded. The competition had to be stopped. Whether the events can be held tomorrow depends on the weather.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening</h3>

<p>Opening of the Games: The opening was announced at 9:00 AM. First, the band played music, which was melodious and rhythmic. Then, all the staff and athletes paraded around the field. The organizing committee had previously requested the Aviation Academy to send a new-style Airplane No. 13 to fly high in the sky above the venue, scattering leaflets, circling back and forth, sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Thousands of colorful papers fluttered like butterflies. Next, everyone stood at attention, the music played, the flag was raised, and the party song was sung. After paying respects to the party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, Vice President Chen Bulei delivered the opening remarks on behalf of President Lu Diping.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: It was briefly mentioned that today the province is holding the third provincial games. President Lu, the chairman, is in Beijing on official business and has specially requested this seat to deliver a speech, briefly mentioning that the province's first provincial games were held in March of the 19th year, the second was held in September of the 20th year, and this is the third time.

In the second half of last year, district games were held in accordance with the outline of the provincial sports games, divided into four districts: Hangzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua, and Wenzhou. Schools and the public participated. One aspect of this games is to review the progress of the province's sports achievements in recent years, and at the same time, to prepare for the National Games.

<h3>Quick Record of Decisive Battles</h3>
<p>College/University 100 Meters: The first event of the Games was the 100-meter final for the college/university group (no preliminary round). Chen Hanzhang from the Aviation School, known for his shaved head and excellent skill, won the championship with a time of 11.7 seconds, breaking the previous Games record of 12 seconds. Second and third place also went to Aviation School athletes. Chen Ruowen from Zhijiang University finished fourth, his performance not particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Women's High School Shot Put: The first district swept the top four places. Li Fang'e and the second of Junji Elementary School were tied for first place, with fierce competition and equal skill. As a result, both achieved 7.19 meters to share first place. The two then had another competition to determine the ultimate winner, with Li Fang'e winning the championship. The results for each person are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Li Fang'e (1st District) 7.19 meters</p>
<p>(2) Li Qing (1st District) 7.19 meters</p>
<p>(3) Ruan Zuzhuang (1st District) 6.91 meters</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Fuchu (1st District) 6.70 meters</p>
<p>Sixth Specialized School 400 Meters: Chen Hanzhang from the Aviation School, again with his shaved head, won another championship with a time of 54 and 2/5 seconds, breaking the Games record of 58 seconds. Yue Yiqin (Aviation) came in second, lagging behind by about five yards. The third place was originally Liu Jian from the Aviation School, but Chuan Zuolin from Zhijiang University surpassed him in the last 50 meters.</p>
<p>Women's High School Javelin Throw: The athletes from the first district swept the top four places. Li Qing won first place with a throw of 34.85 meters, an average result. The records for the top four are as follows: (1) Li Qing (1st District) 34.85 meters</p>
<p>(2) Chen Ciqiu (1st District) 32.00 meters</p>
<p>(3) Shen Jiacen (1st District) 27.53 meters</p>
<p>(4) Yu Yanshen (1st District) 26.38 meters</p>
<p>Men's High School Shot Put: In the men's high school 16-pound shot put, Zang Jize from the second district won first place with a score of 9.60 meters, breaking Leng Peiji's Games record of 9.23 meters. The results for the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zang Jize (2nd District) 9.60 meters</p>
<p>(2) Zeng Culun (1st District) 9.15 meters</p>
<p>(3) Chen Bingren (1st District) 8.38 meters</p>
<p>(4) Lei Junqian (1st District) 8.21 meters</p>
<p>College/University 200 Meters: In the 200-meter final, Chen Yezhang from the Aviation School won his third title with a time of 24 seconds, setting a new Games record (previous record was 24.3 seconds).</p>
<p>Public Shot Put: The results of the public 16-pound shot put were even better than the men's high school group. Yuan He (Hangzhou City) won the championship with a score of 9.71 meters, also a new Games record, and surpassed Zang Jize's (men's high school) score of 9.60 meters. The results for the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yuan He (Hangzhou City) 9.71 meters</p>
<p>(2) Li Jiamin (Yinxian) 9.00 meters</p>
<p>(3) Dai Licheng (Fenghua) 8.46 meters</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Shengkuan (Haining) 8.15 meters</p>
<p>Women's High School 200 Meters: This event was originally a preliminary round, but due to the small number of participants, it was temporarily changed to a final round. There was no good performance. Ms. Ju Bin from the first district won first place with a time of 32.5 seconds. The top three were all from the first district.</p>
<p>College/University High Jump: Jiang Baoguang from the Liberal Arts Department of Zhijiang University and Zhu Xinzhu from Zhejiang University competed fiercely, battling to determine the ultimate winner. Neither yielded to the other. However, at the height of 1.57 meters, Jiang jumped over successfully, while Zhu failed three times. Zhang Zuliang came in third, and Song Jinhai came in fourth, with both clearing just over 1.50 meters.</p>
<p>College/University Shot Put: The results of the top four were very even. Yang Songjing from Zhejiang University strived to win the championship, achieving a distance of 9.42 meters. Although it was also a new Games record, it was quite different from the results of the public and men's high school groups. The results for the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yang Songjing (Zhejiang University) 9.42 meters</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Xiyou (Aviation) 9.36 meters</p>
<p>(3) Leng Peiji (Aviation) 9.33 meters</p>
<p>(4) Chen Peiwei (Aviation) 9.05 meters</p>
<p>Fifth Group 800 Meters: In the fifth group 800-meter final, the best result was 2 minutes 15.8 seconds by Yue Yiqin (Aviation) from the university/specialized school group, only 0.2 seconds off the Games record (2 minutes 15.6 seconds). The second best was 2 minutes 16.8 seconds by Hong Yongtang (2nd District) from the junior men's group, followed by 2 minutes 17.2 seconds by Ling Tingquan from the senior men's group. The worst was the public group, with Zhang Gaojun from Sheng County at 2 minutes 21.2 seconds. The military/police group had only Yu Baojian, with a time of 2 minutes 42.2 seconds, far behind.</p>
<p>Military/Police Group Results: 100 meters: Chu Baozhen, 14.1 seconds; 400 meters: Yu Baojian, 67.1 seconds; 200 meters: Chu Baozhen, 28.5 seconds; 800 meters: Yu Baojian, 2 minutes 42.2 seconds.</p>
<h3>Group Gymnastics Performance</h3>

Participants in the group gymnastics included Provincial High School, No. 11 Middle School, Municipal Middle School, Hangzhou Normal School, as well as private Qingbo, Shufan, Anding, Zongwen, Shiwu, Zhongshan, Zhengze, and Muxing Middle Schools. First, they gathered for morning exercises, with neat movements and energetic spirit. Then, the Provincial Girls' Middle School performed freehand exercises, and the Provincial High School performed flexibility exercises. The Zhijiang University Fitness Team temporarily joined to perform stacked pyramids, parallel bars, etc. Following that, Zongwen Middle School performed freehand flexibility exercises, Hangzhou Normal School performed dumbbell exercises, Shiwu Middle School performed flag exercises, Municipal Middle School performed freehand exercises, Provincial Hangzhou Normal School performed American-style flexibility exercises, Anding Middle School performed flexibility exercises, and Zhongshan Middle School performed Baduanjin exercises.

<h3>Side Stories from the Games</h3>
<p>Chen Bulei's Busy Reception: Chen Bulei, Vice President of the Games, has been promoting sports extensively since becoming the President of Zhejiang University. He arrived at the venue by car at 7:00 am, even before the staff, to personally supervise the workers in arranging refreshments at the podium and to welcome guests. He warmly greeted guests from various organizations and personally distributed a copy of the Games program to each person, attending to everyone and being exceptionally busy.</p>
<p>Instructors' Earnest Admonitions: To the left of the podium, several bamboo sheds were built for athletes to rest. Athletes sat on the ground, either rubbing their legs in preparation for the competition or chatting with each other. The team instructors gave instructions to the athletes, earnestly admonishing them about points of rule violation, hoping that they could create new records. The athletes listened attentively, with a calm attitude, seemingly confident of victory.</p>
<p>Athletes with Empty Stomachs: In the morning, there were only five sports events, but each event had five or six groups participating, held one after another, causing delays. The scheduled end time was 12:00, but the competition was still going on at 12:50. The athletes had arrived early in the morning, and by this point, they could not eat lunch, and were generally feeling the pangs of hunger.</p>
<p>Spectators Turned Drenched Chickens: Yesterday was Saturday, and most schools were closed. In the afternoon, students from various schools arrived in groups, and the number of spectators at the venue suddenly increased. Unexpectedly, the heavens were unkind, and a heavy rain suddenly poured down around 4:00 pm, turning the spectators into drenched chickens. Fortunately, the podium and the judgment, sports promotion departments still provided some shelter from the rain. The general female students, wearing thin clothes, had their figures revealed by the rain, and fled in disarray.</p>
<p>Referees Wading Through Mud and Water: Since the weather was uncooperative and the Games had many events to be completed within a limited number of days, it was not possible to stop. Chief Referee Jiang Xiangqing continued to give commands as usual. The referees could not quit and carried on with their work, wading through the mud and water. Under the heavy rain, the athletes were increasingly excited, which was admirable. Some quick-witted referees borrowed several umbrellas from the sports field to provide some shelter from the wind and rain, but the other referees suffered.</p>
<p>Mats Used as Umbrellas: The heavy rain lasted for an hour and still showed no sign of stopping. On the contrary, the wind and rain became more fierce. Due to the environmental constraints, the track and field events were forced to be suspended. The cloth sheds set up by the Boy Scouts at the venue lost their effectiveness. They hastily gathered their belongings, and each shed had a mat that was temporarily used as an umbrella. Four people shared one mat and sought shelter at the senior high school. All-Suzhou Women's Sports Meet</p>
<h3>Held in a Heavy Downpour Zhenhua Girls' School Wins Group A Championship</h3>
<p>Suzhou Women's Normal School Wins Group B Championship</p>
<p>Games Set Three New Records</p>
<p>(Suzhou, 27th) The third All-Suzhou Women's United Sports Meet was held yesterday (27th) afternoon in a heavy downpour. Thousands of spectators watched, and the athletes from various schools were also in high spirits, not showing any fear of the rain. Male and female guests alike stood upright in the heavy rain with umbrellas. The details of the various events are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Order: The order at yesterday's venue was maintained by the Boy Scouts of Wuchu Elementary School, so it was quite orderly. At the entrance of Soochow University, twelve Boy Scouts from Suzhou Girls' Middle School were arranged on both sides.</p>
<p>Solemn Ceremony: At 2:00 pm, the opening ceremony was held. Athletes from various schools stood in three columns facing Lintang. Flags were raised, and the order was solemn. Ma ZhiKui from the County Sports Field gave a speech on behalf of the Director of Education.</p>
<p>Attending in the Rain: After the opening ceremony, the 50-meter and 100-meter finals began. The Soochow University sports field is 400 meters in circumference, so only the western end was used yesterday. Outside the ropes on the west side were all the Jinghai Girls, their school uniforms were pure white, resembling a short wall of powdered faces. Around 3:00 pm, due to the heavy rain, the guests all stood in a corner with umbrellas, looking out like a cluster of reeds and tents in a vast desert.</p>
<p>Quick Record of the Competition: After the start of the competition, the 50-meter final was held first. There were seven participants in Group A. Cheng Zhang Naiqi, lost by only one meter and came in second.</p>
<p>Later, in the Group A long jump, the first place was Chen Dingrui from Zhenhua, with a score of 3.94 meters. Normally, Chen's score would have been higher, but she suffered a minor foot injury during the preliminary round, which slightly reduced her performance.</p>
<p>Also, both Group A and Group B shot put events broke the previous record. In the Group A preliminary round, as many as 23 people participated. In the end, the first place was won by Huang Lianzhen, which was truly not easy.</p>
<p>The Group A 100-meter final was swept by Zhenhua School. It was unexpected that the school's talent was so evenly matched and rapidly improving.</p>

<p>Casual Talks</p>
<h3>Talking About Wind and Moon</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Let's not talk about state affairs, let's talk about wind and moon. However, looking at the forms of the two characters "wind" and "moon," even wind and moon are not necessarily easy to talk about.</p>
<p>Looking at the head of the character "wind," it seems to have the demeanor of a great power, and the head of the character "moon" also has a microcosm of a small court. The only difference is the openness and closure below. The character "state" guards the surrounding borders, forming a circle, while "wind and moon" do not care about these trivial matters. The top is heaven, the bottom is earth, north and south of the sky. The north is not guarded, and "wind and moon" symbolizes this. Could it be that the national crisis is caused by "wind and moon"?</p>
<p>Looking at the surface of the top, the character "wind" seems to have the demeanor of a great power, and a "worm" sits grandly in the middle. Even if this "worm" character has a stroke like a heavenly crown on top, a "worm" is still just a "worm." Isn't it very difficult to try to make it look good? As for the character "moon," within a small scope where the border is not guarded, there are two strokes that intersect, showing a tendency of two forces not yielding to each other. How can we hope for harmony and unity to face the outside world? It's strange that Cangjie created the characters in this way.</p>
<p>Now the two characters "wind and moon" are linked together. From the one with the demeanor of a great power to the microcosm of a small court, it is quite a sight of the Northern and Southern Song dynasties, which is a very ominous sign. Thinking this way, the two characters "wind and moon" really cannot be written down casually, let alone talked about. The so-called "talk" is never too much, a presentation of perspectives from all sides.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, since state affairs are not easy to talk about, the truth is that "wind and moon" is also not easy to talk about. If you want to talk, you can only find topics other than "wind and moon" and state affairs, and the best model is "Today's weather, hahaha." Because if you say the weather is dull and bad, there is suspicion of slander, and if you say the sun is shining very well, you will be accused of supporting the Japanese flag and be labeled as a traitor to the country. Only a noncommittal hahaha about today's weather is the most clever way.</p>
<p>I have made a character-by-character examination of the two characters "wind and moon," clarifying that there is a truth that cannot be talked about. But we have mouths and must talk about something, and safety is what everyone hopes for. We cannot but carefully consider what to talk about to ensure safety and not betray the mouth we were born with. I hope that everyone within the seas will discuss this at length.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Views on Reading Material</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>(April 29th, British Pearsons Weekly published Shaw's remarks to students of the University of Hong Kong, revealing the secrets of reading and severely criticizing the learning of rote memorization, misleading younger generations. This confirms the words of Zheng Banqiao of the East, who said that scholars should "raise their spines." It shows that the views of heroes of ancient and modern times are similar and are definitely not just humorous deception. Young people who do not quickly "raise their spines," listen to rumors, parrot others, cheat for grades, cheat for diplomas, answer what the teacher wants you to answer, and take pride in getting A's and B's, should have the intelligence to realize that they have been fooled. If they don't even have this intelligence, they might as well get diplomas, write foreign-style stereotyped essays, hurry to get bachelor's, master's, and even doctoral degrees, to become useful talents to society, waiting to be slaughtered. The original article was in the form of a record and was not signed. It is now translated and introduced.)</p>
<p>I have a firm belief that all universities in the world should be torn down, leveled to the ground along with the walls and houses, and salt should be sprinkled on their foundations.</p>
<p>I often remind people that not long ago, culture was almost destroyed by the Great War. We don't yet know whether that war completely destroyed culture, but it doesn't matter much because this war has already proven one thing: that there wasn't much culture in the world to begin with.</p>
<p>That war was caused by people with university educations. There are actually the most dangerous classes in the world. One is the half-educated, who have destroyed half of the culture. Another is the fully educated, who have almost completely destroyed the world.</p>
<p>You should carefully read Professor Flinders Petrie's books.</p>
<p>When I was young丨 in those unbelievably ancient times 丨 no one knew what ancient civilizations were like. We only knew a little about Greece and Rome. Somehow, Rome collapsed, leaving behind a dark age. But before Professor Petrie excavated the ruins of ancient civilizations, no one knew how many civilizations like ours had existed before us. These civilizations were almost all destroyed by education. I think the reason for that is that to prevent civilizations from collapsing, we must have more original minds.</p>
<p>However, universities can only cultivate artificial minds. You come here, and they scoop out your brains and replace them with artificial minds. Therefore, I foresee that our culture will also completely collapse and return to the dark ages.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't know how you will choose. You may ask, "Should we leave the university?" or "Should we go out into the streets?"</p>
<p>I don't know. You can get some benefits from universities. You can get a kind of community life, which is very beneficial. If I had a son, I would advise him to go to school.</p>
<p>I would send him to university and say to him, "Be careful that they don't install an artificial mind in you. As for the books they want you to read, never read them."</p>
<p>A school textbook, by definition, is a book that cannot be read. The reason I was able to become an uneducated person is because I never read school textbooks.</p>
<p>When they required me to read textbooks, I was reading real books 丨 books by writers who could really write. Textbook authors will never belong to this category.</p>
<p>So I say, be careful to read real books, and textbooks should only be read enough to avoid being insulted and expelled.</p>
<p>Read good books, real books, and bury yourself in revolutionary books. Bury yourself in Marxism and all such theories. If you don't start a revolution at the age of twenty, then at fifty you can only become an old fossil. If you are a revolutionary of Marxism at the age of twenty, then at forty you may have some hope of not being outdated.</p>
<p>I can only say to all of you: Go in the direction I have indicated. Always argue with your teachers. If you have a history professor who has taught you his view of history, you should, if possible, say to him, "Hey, stop, we've heard your opinion, but you're about to find a professor who disagrees with you. Let's hear how you two debate."</p>
<p>All learning is repeated refutation. You will find that there is always a conspiracy to arbitrarily tell you to only see one side of things. Many young people enter university who are not qualified to be taught, but they must be given degrees. As a result, they can only be taught how to answer questions.</p>
<p>If you teach them both sides of a question, they will become confused. If you want to pass the exam, never seek the truth of right and wrong. You just have to go up and ask the teacher, "What answer do you want me to give to this question?"</p>
<p>Well, I'm very happy to have this opportunity to put poison in your brains. I hope you will laugh temporarily after listening, and you will all forget it in a week.</p>
<p>In my youth, I was a critic. I often wrote theater and art reviews for a weekly. Whenever I went to visit an art exhibition 丨 say, the Royal Academy 丨 I knew in my heart that I could only write one critical article. At most two articles, but there were two or three thousand pictures in the exhibition. My method was to quickly browse through them and pick out twelve or fifteen that were not "unbearably ugly" to criticize.</p>
<p>You should also take this approach. When your professors and mentors occasionally want to instill knowledge into you, you have to say, "I don't want anything that's not worth remembering."</p>
<p>You must be like garbage collectors, looking in the garbage heaps of history, seeing the value of the things you pick up, remembering the valuable ones, and discarding the rest.</p>
<p>In this way, you will become educated people; your minds will be filled with things worth remembering. Those who can remember everything that is not worth remembering often get the highest degrees. For these people, we only have one way to deal with them, which is to bury them.</p>
<h3>Streets at Night</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhong</p>
<p>The rain-washed street trees, their green coats studded with gold and jade beads, resemble a young woman after her bath, draped in light gauze, standing gracefully by the roadside. The electric lights, peeking through the dense shade of the street trees, watch the asphalt pavement, trod upon yet showing no trace of footsteps, and a pair of young men and women walking in sync. But the beggar huddled in the deep corner of the red wall will never be touched by the bright light waves.</p>
<p>"Master, grandma…have mercy…I haven't eaten for three days!" A sobbing cry emanated from the corner of the red wall.</p>
<p>On this quiet and noble road, in the residential area of ​​high-ranking Chinese and the upper classes of friendly nations, there is actually the moaning of a beggar—what a jarring sight! They glanced at it lightly, then turned their heads and continued their broad strides.</p>
<p>From the rows of automobile headlights and the shimmering streetlights, it was clear that she was of medium height, dressed in simple but neat student attire, her plump face radiating youthful heat; and he? Suited and booted, tall and thin. Her head leaned obliquely on his shoulder, his hand pressed tightly against her waist, they whispered, talked intimately, and walked side by side.</p>
<p>A burst of jazz music flew towards them, which was naturally more pleasant than the beggar's wail.</p>
<p>"Shall we go to the dance hall?" He kissed her hair.</p>
<p>She shook her head, saying nothing; he swallowed, unable to say anything. A moment of silence, broken only by the rhythmic crunching sound of their footsteps.</p>
<p>"Evening news! Want to see the Japanese bandits attacking Peiping and Tientsin! Want to see the Japanese bandits being defeated!…Four coppers a copy."</p>
<p>Although the news vendor's low voice broke the surrounding silence, it failed to attract their attention.</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew.</p>
<p>"I'm a little cold," she said.</p>
<p>He silently helped her with her coat, then returned to his original posture and moved towards the brightly lit XXX.</p>
<p>There were more broken-throated news vendors there, and more miserable wails from beggars, but these were fundamentally unstimulating! They continued to stroll under the graceful street trees, walking side by side, arm in arm, whispering intimately.</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— by Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Wind (Continued)</p>
<p>Lepic, as was his habit, walked from one window to the other. He repeatedly looked at the two children's report cards, paying particular attention to the notices written in person by the principal of the public middle school: the one about the eldest son, Felix, read:</p>
<p>"Impulsive by nature, but intelligent. Promising future."</p>
<p>The one about Carrot Top read:</p>
<p>"Achieves excellent results when he puts his mind to it, but does not often apply himself."</p>
<p>The thought that Carrot Top sometimes achieved excellent results amused the whole family. He now sat with his hands clasped on his knees, soaking his feet in water, feeling very glorious. He felt everyone scrutinizing him. In fact, people were learning to copy him by letting that head of long, dark red hair droop down, looking rather ugly. Lepic, unwilling to reveal his true feelings, only expressed his joy by joking around with him. When he walked past, he flicked his finger on his ear; when he walked back, he nudged him with his elbow. Carrot Top laughed happily.</p>
<p>Finally, Lepic put his hand in his messy hair, flicking his fingernails as if to crush some lice.</p>
<p>This was his playful way of showing affection.</p>
<p>But on the first flick, he crushed one.</p>
<p>"Ah, I got one!" he said. "I didn't miss!"</p>
<p>As he felt a slight disgust and rubbed his fingers on Carrot Top's hair, Lepic's wife raised her arms high:</p>
<p>"I suspected it all along," she said, looking very uncomfortable. "Good heavens! We're finally clean! Elise, quickly go and get a basin, you have something to do now."</p>
<p>The elder sister, Elise, brought a basin, a comb, and a pair of small saucers containing a little vinegar, and then began the hunt.</p>
<p>"Let me comb first!" the eldest brother, Felix, shouted. "I'm sure he gave them to me."</p>
<p>He scratched his head violently, wanting someone to give him a bucket of water to completely submerge his head in.</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss, Felix," said the elder sister, Elise, who liked to help others. "I won't hurt you." She put a cloth around his neck, with the care and patience that a mother has for her son. She separated his hair with one hand and gently held the comb with the other. She neither looked disgusted nor afraid of getting them on herself. She searched for lice for him.</p>
<p>Whenever she said, "Another one!" the eldest brother, Felix, kicked the bottom of the bucket and threatened Carrot Top with his fists, who waited silently for his turn.</p>
<p>"You're done, Felix," said the elder sister, Elise. "You only had seven or eight; you can go and count. Now let's see how many Carrot Top has."</p>
<p>With the first comb, Carrot Top got more than that. The elder sister, Elise, thought she had found a nest of lice, but she had only accidentally caught a group.</p>
<p>Everyone stood beside Carrot Top. The elder sister, Elise, combed intently. Lepic stood with his hands behind his back, watching Elise work like a curious stranger. Lepic's wife complained from time to time.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!" she said, "We need a shovel and a rake for this."</p>
<p>The eldest brother, Felix, squatted on the ground shaking the basin to collect the lice that fell from the comb. These lice fell with bits of scalp. We could see their tiny legs, like eyelashes, moving. They were shaken around in the basin and soon killed by the vinegar.</p>

<p>US Abandonment of Gold Standard Causes</p>
<p>Sharp Fall in Gold Price of $18.70</p>
<p>丨Guangdong Banks Unleash Over Two Thousand Bars丨</p>
<p>The gold market experienced a significant drop yesterday. Although the overseas silver market initially showed a downward trend in the morning, the rise in US cotton and stocks was quite strong. The market opened at $965, down $9.50 from the previous closing. News of the US President Roosevelt's decision to formally abandon the gold standard, sent via Reuters, triggered a wave of selling. Fook Cheong, Bing Hing, and others aggressively sold, driving the opening price lower. Further anticipation that the measure would pass, coupled with news of rising gold mine stocks and the ability of debtor nations to repay war debts in any US currency, fueled a market-wide sell-off. Large players unloaded bars, particularly Guangdong's Hang Hing, which aggressively released over a thousand bars. The exchange rate hardened as a result. However, late buying interest from banks and arbitrage activities among dealers, particularly Dalian banks, led to a recovery. Spot added $60, May-June swaps were priced at a discount of $22.50, and May-July at $34. The pricing issue has been revised by the council, aiming to maintain the $24 calculation, but with adjustments based on changes in gold weight, using the initial HSBC exchange rate for British and American currencies as a standard, calculated monthly. The US exchange rate will still be settled at $24. This proposal is awaiting discussion by the brokers' association today (Sunday). The market conditions for the half-day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened at $965, down $9.50 from the previous closing. Physicals opened at $5.50. The exchange rate also initially showed a strengthening trend, with near-term selling prices at 1 shilling 2 and 7/8 pence for British currency and $24.375 for US currency. However, due to the activity of Fook Cheong, Chi Fung, Wing Hong, and Lee, the price rose from $24.50 to $24.66. The sudden release of unfavorable news caused the decline to intensify. Mitsui was the first to offer August US dollars at $25.00, followed shortly by Banque Belge and Mitsui offering the same month at $25.0625. Qian Changxiang was the first to sell, and Bing Hing, Fook Yu, Zhao Fung, Chang Fook, Chang Yuan, Sheng Wing, Wing Fung, Hang Hing, and others followed suit, breaking the $24.60 level. The exchange rate hardened accordingly. Hang Hing entered the market and aggressively unloaded, pushing the price down further to $24.56. HSBC and Banque Belge bought September US dollars at $25.375. Hang Yu took advantage of the low prices to acquire bars, and short sellers also covered, leading to a gradual rebound. Mercantile bought September at $25.3125. Yuan Sheng, Wing, Zhao Fung, Chang Fook, and Chang all bought, bringing the price above $24.60. HSBC then bought the month at $25.0625, reaching $24.626. HSBC announced that the exchange rate for British and American currency had been lowered by 1/8, and the Yuan Chun sold. Citibank offered September US dollars at $25.3125, but the price still retreated to within $24.60. Chi Fung, Wing Qing Fat, and Wing sold again, causing another decline, as September US dollars at $25.375 proved difficult to sell, falling back to $24.535. HSBC bought August at $25.25, and Mercantile continued to acquire September at $25.4375. Yuan Hing, Wing Fook, and Chang advanced to over $24.70, and the domestic market also showed volatility. After entering, dealers wanted to offer September US dollars at $25.4375 but were unable to find buyers, so they sold bars instead. Fook Cheong was the first to sell, followed by Tai Hing Wing, and the price fell again to $24.532. HSBC and Mitsui bought September US dollars, and Hang Hing suddenly came in to cover, causing the market to fluctuate and rise, reaching $24.63. After this, the market stabilized. Yuan Sheng Wing and Yuan Mao Wing sold, while retail investors bought physicals, hovering around $24.50 for quite some time. Later, due to Wan Hing's acquisition of bars, the price rose to $24.68. Shortly thereafter, the market closed at $955.80. After the close, Chi Fung Wing and physicals were aggressively sold, retreating to within $24.54, so physicals were auctioned at $24.54. The highest price for the half-day was $966.60, and the lowest was $24.532, with a fluctuation of $13.40. The result was a drastic drop of $18.70 from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The price was based on the HSBC US dollar exchange rate being lowered by 1/8, calculated at $24.125, equivalent to a gold price of $994.82, about $39 below the closing price, $13 more suppressed than the previous closing. The registration price for this month is $988, for June $968, and for July $956. The supplemental water in the morning was $988. Spot prices added $60, with little trading. Swaps for May-June were offered by Hui Yuan to Tai Tak Seng at $22.50 for 21 bars, and for May-July, Sui Hing offered Qian Changxiang 364 bars at $34. There are still 2156 bars left for this month, and 5467 bars for June.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was the opposite of the previous day. Although Guangdong banks tried hard to sell bars, Dalian banks and others aggressively bought to hedge, so supply and demand were balanced. In summary, Hang Hing, Bing Hing, Wing Fung, Yuan Chun, Yuan Sheng Wing, Yuan Mao Wing, Chi Fung Wing, Hing Fat Wing and Tai Hing Wing were sellers, while Wan Hing, Shun Lee, Yuan Hing Wing and Fook Cheong, Hang Yu etc. were buyers. Zhao Feng, Chang and Heng Hing first advanced and then sold. Long positions for July were mostly held by the Dalian banks and Shun Lee and Wan Hing, totaling over 6,000 bars. Yuan Heng and Heng Yu and Fook Cheong each had over 2,000 bars. The Heng Hing of Guangdong also had over 1,600 bars, and Qian Changxiang Zhao Feng and Chang had from 700 to over 900 bars. The largest short position was held by Tai Tak Seng, with over 3,500 shorts. Yuan Mao Wing also had over 2,600 shorts. Zhong Kang Rui Hing, Tai Hing Wing, Tong Fung and Heng all had over 1,000 shorts, and Bing Hing had over 700 shorts, for a total of 21,658 bars.</p>

After the opening, due to unfavorable news, banks aggressively sold, causing the trend to harden. Banks selling and then reversing to buy created a fluctuating market, while the gold industry sold aggressively. In total, including Western merchants and speculators, over 1.4 million were sold.

<h3>Interbank Rate Remains at 3%</h3>
<p>丨Calm Settling on Saturday丨</p>
<p>The market situation yesterday was quite precarious. The interbank lending rate in both the morning and afternoon markets remained at 3%. The discount rate was $0.267, slightly lower than the previous day. However, the current market situation is not comparable to spring, and coupled with the sluggish business environment, yesterday was also Saturday, so it was particularly quiet. Interbank lending transactions totaled over 4.6 million in the morning, with over 1 million in new transactions. Afternoon trading amounted to over 400,000. Small association trading amounted to 500,000. Bank receipts included over 900,000 in foreign merchants' receipts for bills and silver, 1.12 million in foreign currency, and over 2 million in various goods, foreign exchange, special and miscellaneous receipts for silver, and 1.78 million in foreign currency, with 300,000 in warehouse receipts.

The total exchange volume at the clearing house yesterday was $5,932,639.45, including $2,425,781.60 in silver dollars and $3,506,917.85 in foreign currency remittances.</p>
<h3>Small Dollars Rise Another Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small dollar was slightly better by a dime in the morning market, calculated at $850.10. It improved by another nine dimes in the afternoon market, calculated at $851.00, for a total increase of one dollar. Transactions made in the morning were 4,500 small dollars, and in the afternoon 8,000 small dollars. Guangdong small dollars were $774.80 in the morning market and $775.00 in the afternoon market, a total improvement of nine dimes compared to the previous day.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Preliminary Completion of Peace</p>
<p>Public Bonds Flourishing</p>
<p>丨Uniform Increases of Several Dimes to $1.10丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw another prosperous trend in public bonds. There was a feeling of a shortage of capital in the market, due to the preliminary completion of the peace conference, with Japanese troops gradually withdrawing and the situation becoming increasingly relaxed. Various groups in the market were covering short positions, and the will to bid pushed market prices soaring, with an upward trend. Various prices rose by several dimes to $1.10, and secondary prices rose by another two to three dimes. However, there were still large sellers of salt tax bonds, which retreated slightly by one to two dimes. The highest price for demobilization bonds was $57.55, setting a new high, reflecting the strong bullish sentiment of the people. Transactions were still lively. Futures for July had mostly opened. The afternoon trend changed slightly, with scattered retail investors taking profits on long positions, and large investors continuing to sell salt tax bonds, causing market prices to fall back by two to six dimes. Closing transactions decreased due to the Saturday effect, and most people wanted to wait and see, so market prices saw mixed ups and downs. However, sales of salt tax bonds were high at #50, and market prices fluctuated sharply. Ultimately, due to strong demand, the market still improved slightly by one to two dimes. As a result, market prices rose by several dimes to $1.10. The future outlook is that if the situation has already turned around, and subsequent negotiations can proceed smoothly, there is still potential for continued gains. The total number of transactions was $17,241,000, including $6,000 in spot transactions. Futures for the unified salt tax accounted for $6,850,000, demobilization accounted for $2,565,000, the 19 customs tax accounted for $2,725,000, the 20 coupon 20 customs accounted for $3,415,000, and the rest ranged from several tens of thousands to three to five hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Trends Higher</h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on Friday (26th) rose to a new high for the year due to the government's proposal to abolish the gold standard law. Buying interest was exceptionally strong, and the ticker tape lagged by as much as twenty minutes. Speculators believed that after the United States formally abandoned the gold standard, the President's power to inflate the currency would be expanded. The New York Federal Reserve Bank's discount rate was reduced to 2.5%, and General Electric's announcement that its dividends would remain unchanged also had a positive impact on the market. The total volume for the day was 4.35 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 86.42 Up 2.69</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 40.99 Up 0.66</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 28.86 Up 0.34</p>
<p>40 Bonds 85.07 Up 0.25</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton</h3>
<p>Standard Yarn and Cotton Rise with US Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn and cotton market surged as US cotton soared, boosting sentiment and triggering short covering. However, some liquidations tempered gains, while labor disputes at Shenxin and Puyi continued. Recent cloth sales have been strong. If demand for cotton yarn can develop after the holiday, the near-term target price for standard yarn is $200.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Also Rises $1-2</h3>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market rose with the external cotton market. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and buying interest was high. Prices for various months rose by 1.8-1.9 to 2 dollars. The afternoon opening saw the Ningbo group make large purchases, strengthening the market. The second and third rounds were slightly weak, but the closing was still higher, with near-term prices falling by 3-7 dimes and far-term prices rising by 1-2-3 dimes. The total turnover for the day was 67,150 bales. The selling parties included Rong Xing with 3,750 bales, Rui Da with 2,800 bales, Zui Yu with 1,850 bales, and Yong Chang with 1,400 bales.

<p>Guangdong 470 Changsha 10 Shantou 100</p>
<p>Inland 330 Colleagues 185</p>
<p>The cotton market saw strong buying interest, as US cotton, after being weak for two days, suddenly rose sharply due to its abandonment of the gold standard and implementation of monetary inflation. It is expected that there will be further price increases in the future, and short sellers are eager to cover. Market prices rose even more sharply, but Rui Da took profits on 15-16,000 dan. Future developments will depend on the movements of US cotton.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Sees High Buying Interest</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard Cotton market opened higher, following the rise in external cotton prices, boosting market sentiment. There was an increase in buyers in the market, and prices for various months rose by 6-7 dimes. Although there was some profit-taking in the afternoon, the market remained strong, with prices for various months rising by another 1.5 dimes. The total turnover for the day was 120,700 dan.

<p>October 4655 95 95,300</p>
<p>July 475 85 43,200</p>
<p>Total 500,600</p>
<h3>High Raw Cotton Prices Lead to Few Transactions</h3>
<p>Demand for spot cotton is still low. Due to the large increase in US cotton prices, holders are unwilling to compromise. The source of supply was 100 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Bao cotton 55.00 Yong An Factory imported 200 pieces sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Rises Sharply by 45 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton saw vigorous and strong gains due to mass buying of cloth, strong cloth trading, and political news favorable to long positions. As a result, spot prices rose by 45 points, and futures prices rose by 39 to 42 points. Liverpool cotton futures rose by 7 points, and spot prices rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Bombay cotton saw European exporters selling, but it was offset by speculator buying. As a result, both Pinggar and White Rossi fell by half a rupee, and Omlah fell by 2.5 cents. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 26th):</p>

<p>Silk Market Cocoon Report</p>
<p>Xintai Early Silkworms Have Entered the Market</p>
<p>Due to sudden weather changes, native silkworms have suffered slight damage. Early silkworm cocoons have entered the market. Native cocoons are mostly thin-skinned. Zhengxin and other cocoon firms have started weighing. Cocoon prices are $25-26. Later rose to $27-28. Superior foreign cocoons can be sold for $30 to $32.3.</p>
<p>Shanglin Foreign Cocoon Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>With sunny and warm weather and smooth development, when the three eyes were releasing leaves, the temperature changed and native silkworms developed silkworm diseases. Fortunately, with the assistance of instructors, the loss of foreign silkworms was still minimal. New cocoons have entered the market. Native cocoon prices are holding at $25-26. Foreign cocoons are $30. Later, due to the shortage of superior cocoons, improved cocoons are looking to rise to $33-34.</p>
<p>Liangzhu Superior Cocoons Arrive at Scarce, High Prices</p>
<p>Early batch native cocoons are thin and of inferior quality, and the initial prices are not high, only holding at $26. Late batch foreign cocoons are of better quality, and the initial prices are $30. However, the arrival of goods is not strong, and various firms are competing to collect superior cocoons, causing a sharp rise to $34-35.</p>
<p>Chen Bai Factory Silk Actively Being Shipped Out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American postal ship President Hoover had a total of 680 pieces of white factory silk shipped to New York. It is heard that the German postal ship Saarland also had more than 30 pieces shipped to German territories.</p>
<p>Sales of Rayon Are Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, only Hangzhou and Shaoxing firms imported 16 cases of this month's Luk Jin Yu, Blue Golden Bell, and Duck Playing Map brands, with prices ranging from $169.25 to $162.50 net.</p>
<p>Lu Yellow Factory Silk Prices Rise by Ten Dollars</p>
<p>Ewo continued to import 100 bales of Lu Yellow Factory Silk, with prices rising by $10 compared to the previous day (the previous day's transaction price of 50 bales was only $640). Ewo and others imported 60 bales of White Factory Silk, 24 bales of Sichuan Yellow Factory Silk, and 5 bales of Mianzhou Yellow Silk. Prices are all rising firmly.</p>
<h3>Black Tea Quiet, Green Tea Booming</h3>
<p>Luzhuang Sui'an Zhenmei Green Tea, after Jilong Foreign Firm handled it the day before yesterday, yesterday Ewo, Jardine Matheson, China Tea, Tianyu and other foreign firms in the market followed suit, and transactions were extremely active. The previous goods have been sold out, and the new goods have not stayed. However, the selling price is low, and it has not rebounded as of yesterday. Native Zhuang Wenzhou Tunxi and other green teas are not very sluggish, but there is not much progress. Qimen black tea, more than 3,000 boxes arrived in the market yesterday. Only Ewo, Tianyu and other European firms are slightly selecting and purchasing Tip and Top grade goods, and prices continue to fall by $10 to $20. The dullness of transactions and the low selling prices are unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Hulled Rice Prices Do Not Expand or Contract</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 suppliers came. The market situation went downhill after the opening of the hulled rice market. By the time the market closed, many customers were enthusiastically bidding, and the situation gradually rose. Until the close of the market, a stable situation was formed. However, market prices expanded and contracted differently. Su Tong Geng and Nangang Thick Paddy Rice slightly improved, and others also rose slightly. This is because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and the preparations are being made accordingly. Although the bag market situation is confusing, Weihaiwei and other stingy gangs continue to act, and each number still has more than 1,000 bags. Therefore, Qingjiao and Songsi thin paddy rice prices can still be stable. Du Yangjian is still regarded as Tingxiu due to the lack of goods, and the supply and demand of Bian Yin Yuan is very different, and the price falls by 20 cents. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and River Hulled Rice will be temporarily suspended for one day.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 or 18 suppliers came from various sources. White Geng moved slowly and was quiet. The market shape was high and stable. The middle and secondary grades were tired by a few points. Thin paddy rice was not strong when it arrived, and sales were sluggish, and the price was slightly off. Early rice, Yang Du Jian, all saw a flat and tired situation. The situation of the埠customers was that Jian was stable, and Yin Bian Yuan was tired. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival in the old calendar, and the business is closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat: The Market Slightly Improves Afterwards</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month showed an initial stable and then flat trend. Due to the quoted prices of foreign wheat, the price was better by one, two, three, or four corners, so at the beginning, the current month was flat because the delivery was approaching and the buyers did not move. The prices of each month in the distant future were slightly collected by external buyers, and there were also slight transactions by Shandong gangs, so the market atmosphere was quite stable. Then the factory continued to issue, and people's hearts softened a little. Until the afternoon, the major factories still had issues, but because the weather turned cloudy, the domestic gangs were buying in various markets, so people's hearts were becoming firm step by step. It is heard that Huafeng is replenishing the gap in the current month, and the quoted price is also improving. According to the current situation, because the new wheat harvest is approaching, the weather conditions are very important. However, the major factories have ample chips, and there is no hope for excessive price increases. As a result, the current month was better by 5 mills compared to the previous day, the June and August months did not move, the July month was better by 2.5 mills, the September month was better by 7.5 mills, and the October month was better by 1 point.</p>
<p>Although the prices of foreign wheat in each month of the wheat market in the morning were better by one, two, three, or four corners, the buyers outside the industry did not see enthusiastic bidding, resulting in light transactions in each market, and the prices did not increase or decrease. Until the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation in each month was slightly better, and transactions also turned slightly better. Because the flour market was also stable, and the weather was not good, there will inevitably be problems regarding the future of the new wheat, so the sellers tightened, and the market atmosphere turned stable. As a result, the July, August, and September months were each better by 1 point compared to the previous day. The October month opened at $4.55, with no comparison, and the rest did not open.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sliced Green Cargoes are Scarce and Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was quiet and trending flat and tired due to the upcoming five-end settlement period. The guild's allocated price of 24 groups of ordinary white granulated sugar was $20.4, the price of 20-number medium white granulated sugar was $19.8, and the price of 8-number Dutch red sugar was $6.23, with few transactions. Changxing Firm offered Guanghua Factory's Lu character at $20.075, Shou character at $20.015, ground granulated sugar plus Guangbao at $21, and RA cotton Dutch white at $21.7. Only Chao opened a market price for Huanggang Qing Hong Kong for a total of 300 bags of sugar, with prices ranging from $12.45 to $12.2, and $11.5 to $11.3. Because the base stocks of sliced green cargoes were depleted, the prices suddenly rose. Yesterday, more than 100 pieces of high-grade slices were offered at $9.65, which was 45 cents better than before.</p>

<h3>Injustice for Men</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>In this era of women's empowerment, men naturally have many grievances. However, my piece "Injustice for Men" is not a reflection arising from women's empowerment. Even if women are not empowered, men still bear two kinds of "wrongful burdens of sin." What two kinds? Listen to me explain:</p>
<p>(1) The ideographic meaning of the characters for man and woman is that "strength in the fields" is man, and "broom" is woman. This shows that shouldering a plough is a man's duty, and holding a broom is a woman's natural role. According to the rules, street sweeping duties on the road and cleaning work in the city should be performed by women. However, that is not the case. There are only street sweepers, not street sweeper women; there are only sanitation workers, not sanitation worker women. What is the reason that the broom next to the woman character is transferred to the hands of men? Alas! Wrongful burden of sin!</p>
<p>(2) Because the Han Dynasty was a strong era in China, Chinese people are called Han people. By extension, men are Han men, and good men are good Han men. What an honor! Ever since the term "Han traitor" came into being, women have been saying it loudly. "Han traitors, Han traitors, are all men. Therefore, those who are lackeys of the Japanese are all cursed as Han traitors, and no one curses them as traitor women. This shows that being a Han traitor is a male profession." However, that is not the case. Among the spies, there are many female spies. Once they are exposed, everyone also curses them as Han traitors, and does not specially give them the title of traitor woman. It is the fate of men to be unlucky. Alas! Wrongful burden of sin!</p>
<h3>Don't Talk About State Affairs</h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>In any casual teahouse, there is always a sign hanging that says, "Beware of Pickpockets." Some more cautious tea servers simply add a red paper strip next to "Beware of Pickpockets," writing "Don't Talk About State Affairs." In fact, what's the big deal about talking about state affairs? You just shouldn't talk乱, that's all. For example, "Our army's broadsword team killed the enemy soldiers so that they were holding their heads and shouting daddy repeatedly." Then, just say how the enemy soldiers are脓包and you definitely won't be regarded as a "Han traitor," "enemy spy," or "troublemaker." If it's "Our army retreats at lightning speed," or "Due to strategic reasons, we are changing to a new defensive line," and your esteemed self is "talking about state affairs" in a place that happens to be just outside of "that new Chen line that is calmly responding to the battle," then a mouthful of "benevolent rule" and "paradise" would be to describe the enemy soldiers' gang rape of some old woman. At least you should say, "How fortunate the old woman is." I can vouch for this, patting my chest, that you can talk about state affairs all your life and you won't get your head chopped off.</p>
<p>"Don't Talk About State Affairs." The "three old men at the bridgehead" in teahouses might still respectfully obey the tea server's orders. But if news reporters who rely on "talking about state affairs" to earn a living also regard "Don't Talk About State Affairs" as the golden rule, wouldn't that be terribly, terribly bad?</p>
<p>Actually, that's not the case. News reporters have their own methods for "talking about state affairs." For example, if the person in power says, "The suffering Chinese people," the news reporter will expound on the two words "suffering" to the fullest extent. Furthermore, if the elders say, "What crime have the young men committed? The crime lies with the old men," then the news reporter will write straight in his pen, "What crime have the highly respected elders committed? The crime lies with the old people who don't care about state affairs." If news reporters "talk about state affairs" and "lead public opinion" in this way, they will definitely not resist the wet wood tip, and perhaps they can leap to a position. Therefore, those who恪遵 to "Don't Talk About State Affairs" are the greatest fools in the world. Those who "talk about state affairs" without looking at the wind direction are also great fools.</p>
<h3>Hong Foshi's Novels</h3>
<p>— Jielu</p>
<p>Speaking of this matter, it has been more than twenty years ago. In revolutionary history, perhaps it has some value for records. During the last years of the Qing Dynasty, when the relatives of the imperial family were in power and the country was in decline, the court used the talk of "preparing for constitutionalism" to deceive the people. Several enlightened patriots borrowed the running of newspapers as the mouthpiece for promoting revolution. Although the literary net was still tight at that time, they had to hide their swords in scabbards and write with veiled language, but there was something in their words. However, a burst of "vitality" seemed even stronger than today's newspapers. Yu Sao-xin (Youren) ran a newspaper called "Min Hu Bao" (People's Appeal), but it was soon banned by the Qing government. Mr. Yu dug out the two eyes of the character "Hu" (Appeal), and "Min Yu Bao" (People's Exhortation) appeared. Coincidentally, at this time, Zhejiang was experiencing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Incident, and the general manager Tang Zhexian (Shouqian) started the Tianduo Bao. He hired Cixi Chen Tianying (Xunzheng) as general manager, Hong Foshi (Yunxiang) as editor-in-chief, Feng Shigong (Kai) as the novelist, and Hu Piaowa (Liangzhen) as the editor. Except for Mr. Tang, it was completely a Cixi people's Qing dynasty. After Tianduo was published, it suddenly released a different color in the newspaper industry, with Haohaodangdang's Foshi editorials, very much in the style of the owner of the Bingyin Room. There were also the Qingli and elegant Shigong notes and novels, enough to compete with the Pingdeng Pavilion notes of that time, and the cold-blooded and amused novels, and everyone came out to show off.</p>
<p>However, at this time, Shenxin and the two newspapers took the business community as their position and did not carry any color. The Times seemed to be close to the Liang Rengong faction. (The current Times is no longer run by Di Pingzi, and its nature has completely changed.) Min Yu had some fire, and Tianduo had a special flavor, containing the revolutionary anti-Manchu goods, which was the same. Later, Tianduo also hired Dai Tianchou (Chuanxian), who is now the president of the Examination Yuan; and Chen Bulei (Xunen), who is now the director of the Zhejiang Education Department. Both of them were young and handsome, and their papers were indulgent and rebellious, awakening a lot of the decadent people's spirit at that time. Later, Li Huaishuang (Jiarong) came to take over the post of editor-in-chief, Liu Yazi (Qiji) came to be the editor, and Zou Yayun (Quan) compiled the essays, all of whom were Nanshe veterans. The revolution had already succeeded, and the Tianduo Bao was in its golden age.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about Mr. Hong. Mr. Hong, from Shanbei, Cixi, personal name Yunxiang, style name Qiaoling, "Foshi," "Canfo," and "Tianzui" were all pen names in Tianduo Bao. Mr. Youxue was studying in Japan in his early years; he liked wine, was good at poetry and writing, and had served as a professor of history and geography in various universities in the North and South. I have always called him "Ningbo Wu Zhihui," but Wu was滑稽, while Hong was耿直, and their knowledge was very similar. Mr. Hong has a deep knowledge of Buddhism, and is friendly with Xie Wuliang (Meng) in Sichuan. Mr. Xie wrote a eulogy when Mr. Xie passed away last month: "He traveled with the bell and drum, and the drunkard was generous and patriotic: He sang proudly from the phoenix tree, and the poetry scrolls were still full of his home." To call Mr. Hong a "drunkard" and "poet," Mr. Hong would definitely agree if he knew in the afterlife. Mr. Hong wrote "The Daughter of Liu Hui," which is a Taoist novel. "Sister of the莽 Monk," is a Buddhist novel. Both works are written in the style of the Tang Dynasty, and have the same wonderful effect as the novels of Monk Manshu. It is amazing and brilliant, and it is really beyond the reach of mediocre people. It is not impossible to call Mr. Hong a "novelist."</p>
<h3>Jai Alai Court</h3>
<p>— Chuanzhi</p>
<p>Buick, Meitong, Ford, red, black, orange and yellow cars of various colors, lined the intersection of Avenue Joffre near Avenue Albert; the lush green parasol trees and the Western-language electric light advertisements outside the Jai Alai court, red and green interwoven, reflected each other interestingly, occasionally passing by, I almost suspected it was a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>The players are already dedicating their skills, and thousands of eyes are unanimously focusing their attention on one focal point | the Jai Alai ball: At the highest points on both sides of the court, there are lead plates (Score Board) hanging, recording the results of the betting, marked with the number of times (Event No.) points (Points) wins (W.) and the names of the players in Western languages like Romas. Olberdi. "Double Win啦 (Double Win)!" A barefooted, bare-armed foreign young mistress is shouting at a middle-aged noblewoman who looks like a pig that has been watered in a meat farm.</p>
<p>A white-clad waiter is smilingly sending a stack of banknotes over, counting them one by one to the middle-aged noblewoman, probably ten dollars each, right! After the white-clad waiter finished counting the banknotes, his two black pupils stared fixedly at the middle-aged noblewoman, looking like he was waiting for her to give him a tip; but she didn't pay attention to these, and was talking to another foreign noblewoman about something. The white-clad waiter knew he was disappointed, so he turned his eyes, wrinkled his nose, and turned away to deal with other gamblers.</p>
<p>Zhang San, with a big belly, handed a ten-dollar bill to waiter A to buy tickets (note: gambling tickets). Miss Wang, in an graceful posture, took out several five-dollar bills from her purse and handed them to waiter B to buy tickets; after a while, waiter A came here with a large stack of tickets and distributed them, and waiter C and waiter D also held a large stack of tickets and distributed them there. I became昏暓in the midst of the coming and going of banknotes and gambling tickets, and胡思...</p>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Severing Affection with a Few Words, Crying Bitterly Behind Closed Doors; Shouldering Morality and Justice, Discussing Over Wine</p>
<p>However, he didn't care at all, and slapped his chest and said; We soldiers carry the characters "loyalty" and "justice" on our two shoulders. Our天职is to shed blood, and shedding blood is a daily routine. Under such circumstances, what do we need a family for? Just keep two arms to carry the gun杆儿, that's all. The three company commanders were very excited after hearing these words, and they couldn't help but blush. Only Zhao Weng picked up his wine glass and drank,摸着his beard, but remained silent. Guan Yaowu laughed and said: Stop talking, old man, looking at this, he's saying some big words to save his life. Zhao Weng shook his head and said: You see that I didn't say anything and think that I don't agree with you? That's not right. I think all military personnel should take on some burdens for the country. For example, we are掌櫃的in a rice store. We should all take on some burdens for the East family. Only in this way can we be worthy of holding a rice bowl for others on a regular basis. As the saying goes: "Raising soldiers for a thousand days is for one朝." What do we usually need you to do? Isn't it just to know how to protect the country and take on a burden other than exercising? I didn't make a sound because I had another idea. Saying that, he picked up the wine glass again, slowly抵着the wine on the rim of the glass, thinking to himself, there was a word in his heart that he wanted to say. He took another hand and touched the tip of his beard a few times, and then changed his mind and held back what he wanted to say. Tian Qingxin was thinking that the purpose of coming to Zhao's house today to attend the spring drinking party was to make the old man happy. Now everyone's words, although the old man is willing to listen on the surface, he feels uncomfortable in his heart. If he keeps talking like this, everyone will end up breaking up unhappily. So, in front of Zhao Ziqiang, he took the wine pot, shook it and made a沙隆沙sound a few times, stood up and laughed: I should toast the old man a cup of wine, but I don't know if the old man will honor me. Zhao Weng said: I can勉强drink a cup, but I don't know if Ziqiang can let me drink a cup. (83)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Children's International War</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Narrow Road Boxing Early in the summer morning, on Avenue of Kindness in West Shanghai, there were many pedestrians on both sides, mixed with Chinese and foreigners, young and old. A white child, a white child of six or seven years old, was walking踽踽. Two Chinese children of about ten years old came walking towards him. When they passed the white child, one of the children仲hand抚his face, and after抚, they laughed wildly, apparently meaning to insult him. This white child was under the current two strong enemies who were taller than him. In theory, he could only be afraid, cry, cover his滬eyes and go home to sue his parents in order to seek solace. But he didn't, absolutely didn't. No sooner said than done, his innocent smiling face was immediately covered with a layer of ice, his beautiful eyebrows were immediately豎, and his exquisite eyes immediately睜. A white child who was full of smiles immediately turned into a terrifying little devil. At this time, the two Chinese children were still standing three feet away from him and the laughter had not stopped. Seeing his anger, they continued to laugh. The white child's small fist clenched tightly. Unexpectedly, he punched one of the children in the stomach, followed by a punch at the one who was laughing more peacefully. He missed the one who shrank down and punched him in the empty air. He became even more angry and finally chased up and punched him. The one who was punched in the stomach first felt the pain and immediately stopped his laughter,收拾起 his smile, and while he was hitting his companion, he punched him in the back with a cold拳. The white child back　着attacks, immediately turned around and waved his fist. Afraid of being attacked on both sides, he looked back at the latter and saw that he had no intention of attacking, so he used all his strength on one side, and a small fist held tightly was waved forward one after another. Our yellow child suddenly didn't dare to懋war,仲his hands, and retreating while pushing. The white child approached step by step, and the yellow child retreated step by step. Although they didn't蹩土a hundred miles, the white child had already chased a distance of one丈. An old man in the audience saw that this international war was inappropriate to纠结down, so he stepped forward and义不容辞became the international police among them. Only then did the white child stop approaching, and the yellow child stopped抗and退. The old man said sternly to the yellow child: Insulting others for no reason deserves punishment. If you are beaten and dare not resist, you are really a useless thing, go! The yellow child seemed to realize that he was at fault and felt ashamed and left. The one who had been punched and stood遥looking at the rice also turned around and left. What about the white child? The color of his anger receded slightly, replaced by a smile. I knew that he felt the pleasure of victory in his heart. He no longer needed other people's安慰, and went regardless of everything. I looked at him going, looking at this little warrior going. I learned his spirit of not being afraid of strong enemies, his spirit of being fearless, his spirit of indomitable will, his spirit of独断乡行, which made me admire him. I looked at him from a distance to an intersection and was about to turn in. I couldn't help but shout out loud... Little warrior! You are the fitter of this world, you are the ruler of this world.</p>
<p>Missiles Flying Across the River Outside one side of Zhaofeng Park, there is a small stream弯弯protecting it; the bank of the stream is a dirt road, directly leading to the city dust of Caojiadu. One evening in late spring, I was walking through here, and three or five children were walking and singing. Two Western children in the park across the river suddenly took a piece of mud and threw it at them, and it happened to hit one of the children's heads. He also immediately picked up a pill and flew it over云. Naturally, the ones on the other side were not weak. The two children grabbed the mud with both hands and flew it over. Seeing that they were attacking together, they also joined forces to resist insults. They picked up the mud and threw it one after another. For a time, they stood in formation across the river, and mud and dirt flew back and forth. Neither side shouted, but沉着应战. Some hit, some fell on the shore, and some fell into the water, with waves splashing everywhere. At this time, three of my yellow-skinned children walked into the park. Suddenly, a bullet flew from this side, and it happened to hit one of them's hats. He immediately took off his hat and took a look. Seeing that it was dirty, his anger suddenly rose. He bent down and grabbed the mud and threw it over. He only knew that he had suffered damage, and forgot that this was a struggle between yellow and white, and that he was a compatriot of the yellow. The顽童s here saw him为虎作倀and immediately cried out "Han traitor, Han traitor". Han traitor, the Han traitor that everyone is ashamed of. The one on the other side heard them骂him a Han traitor, and sure enough, he realized and　the未thrown弹and退后to stand遥looking. Finally, the Western children were outnumbered and退while战and没into the林. The ones here were still飞several弹to the林in恨beforestopping. I could not move forward because of阴them流弹. This international war again let me看个痛快. The strength of the three or five children to resist together, I admired their courage, and为them忻喜will have a foothold in this world in the future. The one Han traitor there觉悟quickly, also令me起respect. If you are insulted, you can resist. If you know that you are wrong, you can change. We are一代愿its个个so.</p>

<h3>From the Economic Collapse to Urban Dilemmas</h3>
<p>The introduction of capitalism into Chinese villages has, on one hand, increasingly tied Chinese agricultural production to the commodity system. The daily necessities required by rural China are ever more dependent on urban markets that supply goods. On the other hand, it has destroyed the home handicrafts that served as a sideline in rural areas, making them gradually need independent production departments that are different from agricultural taxes. The former increases the expenses of the peasants, while the latter reduces their income, thus making the peasants vulnerable to hunger and threats. The excessive levies of taxes, the heavy burden of land rent, and the piercing exploitation of commercial and usurious capital—all these are the feudal forces' seizure of the peasant masses, intensifying the process of peasant impoverishment. At the same time, there are often civil wars among Chinese warlords, with the conflicts among the various imperialists as their backdrop, which further burden the peasants with pre-war provisions, wartime requisitions, harassment, destruction (the so-called disasters of war), and various post-war reconstruction expenses. The Chinese peasant masses, caught in such a process of impoverishment, have no choice but to gradually reduce the scope of their production, and agricultural techniques can only become increasingly crude, with no possibility of improvement. As for the improvement of water conservancy, it is naturally out of the question. These are all important phenomena reflected in the essential nature of the collapse of China's rural economy. In other words, China's rural economy has collapsed under the dual exploitation of imperialist economic aggression and feudal forces.</p>
<p>The natural and man-made disasters that have occurred in various Chinese cities over the years, whether interchangeably or continuously, are merely the general manifestations of the collapse of China's rural economy, especially the great flood of the year before last and the disastrous bumper harvest of last year, which further demonstrated the universality and depth of this pattern.</p>
<p>The result of the collapse of China's rural economy, in addition to causing death, displacement, banditry, and unrest, has also led to a further decline in the purchasing power of the peasants and a further shrinking of the Chinese market. This has at least two kinds of impact on industry. One is that the sales of industrial manufactured goods are further reduced; urban industry not only loses its basis for expansion, but is also bound to shrink. The second is that a large number of unemployed peasants constitute a crowded situation in the urban and rural labor market, leading to a general reduction in wages, a general impoverishment of workers' lives, a decline in workers' purchasing power, and the market shrinks once again, forcing industry to contract even further.</p>
<p>Looking at the various sectors of Chinese industry, whether traditional specialized industries or modern mechanized industries, they have all become extremely desolate recently. For example, the famous Hangzhou silk industry is in such a state of decline that it is unimaginable, leading to a trend of work stoppages. The old-style silk weaving industry is like this, and the new-style textile industry is no better. The recent reduction of work at Shanghai yarn factories is said to be influenced by the dumping of Japanese goods, but the shrinking of sales over the years cannot be said to be unrelated, can it?</p>
<p>So, what will happen to urban commerce? Can it avoid this crisis and prosper independently? Here, let us use only the most obvious fact of sales as a basis for explanation.</p>
<p>In recent years, especially recently, because the reduced market cannot accommodate the already reduced production volume, a strange phenomenon of massive price reductions has been created. This phenomenon is now widespread throughout China. In any place, in front of the shops, there are usually constantly changing tactics, either saying "big price reduction," or "giving away gifts," or "discounting"... Occasionally walking down the street, one can receive several advertising leaflets for silk and satin, pharmacies, tea shops, and shoe stores, as if the customers have not visited their doors for a hundred years, creating a phenomenon that has never existed before. As for scheduled price reductions, there must be grand celebrations for several weeks of anniversaries and the usual seasonal events for spring, summer, autumn, and winter; and after the expiration date, they thank their customers for their patronage and extend the period again, continuously without end. Shanghai, known for its prosperity, is considered the most concentrated place for consumers, and this phenomenon of price reductions is also occurring continuously. The large price reduction flags fluttering in the wind in front of major companies and stores on various roads, or the broadcasts from gramophones and radios, are competing to do their best to attract customers, and even during the cheap period, there are so-called specially cheap goods, and so on. All this, on the surface, seems like a lively event, but in essence, is it not a sign of the depression of urban commerce!</p>
<h3>Life: I Sold My Eyes</h3>
<p>— Zhen Xin</p>
<p>(Proofread) The reasons why I abandoned my position as an elementary school teacher and became a proofreader in a bookstore are roughly the following two, but now I realize that these are two reasons that are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>First, the work is easy. Everyone who has not been a proofreader thinks that proofreading is the easiest job in the literary field. As long as one can read books and has a little knowledge of various sciences, it is more than enough to be a proofreader; I thought so at first too. But in reality, it is not the case at all. Is it possible to ensure that there is not a single mistake in a thick book of one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand words? With sloppy and confused manuscripts, with the styles of various schools and genres, describing all kinds of specialized knowledge, as well as blurred proofs and glossy paper that reflects white light, is it possible to ensure that there are no mistakes under these conditions? Moreover, one must also pay attention to the most easily overlooked page numbers, headings, and spines, and perhaps the printing workers secretly give you some hard-to-detect flaws. Under these conditions, is it possible to ensure that there are no mistakes? Now I am convinced that being a proofreader is more difficult than being an editor.</p>
<p>Second, one can gain more knowledge. Everyone has this idea, thinking that by doing proofreading, one can read many books for free and improve one's knowledge. Didn't I think so at first? But now I know that this is like buying a champagne ticket and wanting to win four hundred and twenty thousand or five hundred thousand—a complete fantasy. If a proofreader only focuses on the meaning of the book and does not pay attention to each individual word that makes up that meaning, then I believe that after publication, there will be many mistakes and he will be met with cold stares from the bookstore owner or the newspaper editor. The editor-in-chief's job is to determine acceptance or rejection from the viewpoint of the entire book and the subject matter (accept or return); the editor's job is to determine acceptance or rejection in each paragraph and each sentence (modify); and the proofreader's job is to determine acceptance or rejection in each individual word. Because the duties are different, the focus of attention is also different. The proofreader only pays attention to each word, such as the difference between "裏" and "裹," the difference between "已" and "巳," the difference between "綱" and "網," and the difference between "逈" and "迴," and so on. Can attention to each of these words increase knowledge? It is just like the joke of the blind men touching the elephant.</p>
<p>So, what do I actually get from this job? Yes, that is "I sold my eyes," and the price is only a monthly salary of ten-odd yuan!</p>
<p>I have been a proofreader for less than a year, and I have already changed to a pair of nearsighted glasses that are one hundred degrees deeper than before. Now I can no longer see clearly the gold characters of XX Lane, XX Fang. This is not only true for me alone; none of my colleagues are not obviously aware of it. Because of this, we have also thought of many remedies, such as using green gauze covers on electric lights, asking the printing house to print the reverse side of the proof (i.e., the rough side of the glossy paper), and so on. But even so, selling our eyes is still the same, only the difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps.</p>

<h3>The Child Who Picks Up Tennis Balls</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>"The sun is on the wall," Lao Wu said, "The ball boy is late again."</p>
<p>Really, we could tell this from the doorway. Over there, at the end of the court, he—that child—was dragging a thin, dark shadow as he ran.</p>
<p>"This little bastard, still walking slowly," Lao Zhang muttered.</p>
<p>Lao Wang also got angry and shouted, "Kid, hurry up!"</p>
<p>Panting and sweating, he hurried to set up the net on the court and immediately started drawing the lines on the ground.</p>
<p>Lao Zhang stood idly, while Lao Wang stood in the shade, watching angrily.</p>
<p>The sun was baking him like fire. He was a pale, haggard, and weak child. He used his weak hands to push the lead bucket forward. Lime leaked from the small holes, leaving white straight lines on the ground, forming a rectangle.</p>

<p>The lines were drawn. Lao Wang and Lao Zhang stood facing each other, each holding a tennis racket. They began to hit the ball, hitting it quickly to see who was better. The ball jumped back and forth over the net, and the rackets hit it, making a crisp sound.</p>
<p>He stood straight beside them, like a piece of wood. Suddenly, when he was not prepared, a ball hit him on the head. The ball was heavy, and it raised a bump on his forehead, causing a burning pain. He did not shout because shouting was useless.</p>
<p>"Can't you be more careful?" Lao Wang said to him, "Stupid thing!"</p>
<p>Lao Zhang shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>
<p>They continued to hit the ball. As if attacking an enemy, they gritted their teeth, used all their strength, and hit wildly. The ball flew out like a bullet.</p>
<p>So he—that child—quickly started running, his legs and arms like wings. After running dozens of steps, he grabbed the solid ball and threw it back with all his might. He had already used all his strength, but the ball still could not reach the court.</p>
<p>"Have you eaten? So weak!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, they hit lightly, and the ball did not go over the net, but fell in front of them. To avoid getting hit on the head by the ball, this child dared not step into the court. So they got angry again: "If you don't come to pick up the ball, what are you waiting for!"</p>
<p>The ball was always so unpredictable, sometimes going east and sometimes west. He kept running after it, as if a shuttlecock string was pulling him on the ball. He ran until he was drenched in sweat, but he still kept running.</p>
<p>The sun was high in the sky. Lao Wang and Lao Zhang had already drunk five bottles of soda.</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, he felt his legs heavy in the hot sunlight, as if they were tied with two lead cakes. He stood there blankly, his whole body so weak that he almost collapsed.</p>
<p>But Lao Wang and Lao Zhang were both smiling. They continued to hit their ball as if nothing had happened, still shouting in that rude tone: "Kid, go pick up the ball quickly!"</p>

<h3>A General Review of the Yarn Factory Layoff Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yunshi</p>
<p>At present, in China's serious political and economic problems, in addition to the crazy invasion of Japanese imperialism, the most obvious evidence of the thorough bankruptcy of national industry is the recent implementation of work reduction in yarn factories across the country. The invasion of Japanese imperialism is enough to subvert the entire nation's life, and the yarn factory layoffs are the most obvious proof of the thorough bankruptcy of national industry.</p>
<p>In the storm of layoffs implemented by yarn factories across the country, we can hear three different voices. One is standing on the position of the capitalists, saying that the factory's layoffs are a last resort. In the current situation of overproduction of cotton yarn, if the factory does not reduce work in time, it will be completely bankrupt. At that time, the workers will not even be able to find half a job, which is what is called "If the skin does not exist, what will the fur adhere to?" Therefore, the current implementation of layoffs by yarn factory capitalists is indeed for their own benefit on the one hand, but it is also thinking for the workers on the other hand. One is standing on the interests of the workers, saying that in this time of national economic bankruptcy and numerous unemployment, the workers' original wages are already insufficient to live on, and now they have to reduce work (actually reducing wages), which is tantamount to putting the workers to death. Therefore, yarn factory capitalists should not only care about their own interests and implement layoffs. Another is the third party's statement between the two, in the third party's opinion, the yarn factory capitalists' layoffs are out of necessity, and the workers' opposition also has half the truth. However, the best way is in this autumn of national crisis, the workers must always appreciate the capitalists' difficulties, suffer temporarily, and work hard to produce in order to save China. In the future, when the national disaster turns into national celebration, the foundation of yarn factories across the country will be consolidated, and the lives of the workers can be improved. In fact, in my opinion, except for the worker's side being precious, the rest are nothing but "scratching the surface." Whether in theory or practice, there are shortcomings.</p>
<p>We know that Chinese workers, especially yarn factory workers, are the most miserable. The working hours are particularly long, but the wages are particularly meager, so meager that they simply cannot maintain their lives. This is a well-known fact. Now, because of the overproduction of cotton yarn and the shrinking of the market, the resulting result is of course to starve all the yarn factory workers in China to death one by one. On this point alone, yarn factory capitalists and the government have no way to defend themselves. Therefore, in any case, yarn factory capitalists should never disregard the lives of workers because of temporary difficulties.</p>
<p>Conversely, the immature Chinese industry is indeed at the end of its rope at the moment and urgently needs to be saved. However, before taking measures to save it, one must understand its root causes in order to prescribe the right medicine and have an effect. Otherwise, giving up eating because of choking is not the right way, and it may even aggravate the severity of all domestic panic and chaos. Yarn factory layoffs are such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese industry cannot develop and is instead declining day by day is solely because it has been invaded by imperialists. The inability to control tariffs and the inability to recover concessions have led to diseases such as the dumping of foreign goods and the monopoly of foreign capital. Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the four northeastern provinces have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, and the Songhu area has been completely destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire. Then came market shrinkage, political chaos, economic bankruptcy, increased unemployment... etc., which are fatal blows, and the overproduction of Chinese cotton yarn is naturally inevitable. Therefore, to save the major crisis of yarn factories across the country, it is not to reduce work, but to actively resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism and the oppression of other imperialists. If it is not like that, even if the workers' work and wages are reduced to the point where they cannot be reduced, they cannot save this dying fate. Why is it that Chinese capitalists do not dare to raise the banner of anti-imperialism? They will only meekly submit to them, allowing them to oppress and exploit, while turning around and desperately trying to get back the losses they have suffered from the Chinese workers. The implementation of layoffs in yarn factories across the country is the most obvious example.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we stand on the position of the interests of the entire nation, we should unconditionally oppose the yarn factory layoffs. Because this kind of layoffs cannot save the crisis of yarn factories across the country and is enough to put countless workers to death. To solve the crisis of yarn factories, there is only liberation of China, and conversely, only when China is liberated can China's cotton textile industry and other industries be prevented from declaring bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>On "Promoting Domestic Goods" and "Labor-Capital Coordination"</h3>
<p>— Discussion by Councilor He Xingxiu</p>
<p>(Fourth Discussion on the Case of How to Maintain the Livelihood of Laid-Off Yarn Factory Workers)</p>
<p>In the last issue of this magazine, Yiping-jun spoke voluminously about this issue, but at the root of it all, it was nothing more than "promoting domestic goods" and "labor-capital cooperation."</p>
<p>It is said that China has boycotted Japanese goods twelve times. Of course, the "promotion of domestic goods" that followed has also happened twelve times. However, as a result, Japanese goods have been boycotted once, and sales have become more prosperous once. Domestic goods, despite being promoted, cannot be promoted. This is not as simple as what some people say is a "five-minute fever," nor is it as simple as Yiping-jun said is "the dumping of foreign goods." The question is why foreign goods are dumped and why domestic goods cannot be promoted.</p>
<p>Capitalism, when it stormed into the old and large China, had already reached its final stage and regarded the discovery of such a large market as a life-saving elixir. All capitalist countries want to monopolize it, but because of mutual containment, they maintain the independence of a "Republic of China." Such independence is already an extraordinary favor, and are they willing to let Chinese national capital rise up to oppose them? Therefore, they used methods such as "tariff agreements" and "establishing factories in China"... many methods to oppress China's emerging industries. At the same time, national capitalists, for their own survival, had to surrender and become compradors. National capital has no possibility of construction at all. Isn't "promoting domestic goods" a big joke?</p>
<p>As for the high-sounding tunes of "labor-capital cooperation" and "labor-capital coordination," they have been sung for many years, but what is the result? These two antagonistic forces, which have no room for compromise, have launched a bloody struggle. The so-called "being in the same boat," etc., seem to have become good-sounding terms in the mouths of the rich. Because Yiping-jun's consciousness is incorrect, the conclusion he draws, such as "industry and commerce are unusually developed, the national life is very active, and the lives of workers will naturally improve," will become a golden check that can never be cashed!</p>
<p>So, what is the way out for the workers? In my personal opinion, workers only have a way out under the premise of uncompromising resistance.</p>

<h3>Yearning</h3>
<p>— Yang Fuwan</p>
<p>At present, the misery of the masses' lives is an undeniable fact. We shop assistants can continue to maintain our jobs in the current society where there are hundreds of millions of unemployed people, which seems to be "uniquely blessed." However, the happiness of a few contrasts with the difficulty of our lives. The oppression and exploitation of the imperialists have aroused our weak sense of sorrow. Material enjoyment, the prosperity of the streets... are all enough to stir up our desires. We cannot idealistically say that we want to suppress our desires, and at the same time, we cannot use the philosophy of "settling down and establishing a life" and "not competing with the world" to comfort our souls. So some of us spend our days pursuing some elusive and vague yearnings, and some wait quietly for these yearnings to come. But what exactly are these yearnings? What are we pursuing and expecting?</p>
<p>First, are we expecting "upward mobility"? "Upward mobility" means that a young man will become a big boss, a female worker will become a shop owner (recently, there was a domestic film with such a plot, but it is still a movie), and a young apprentice will climb to the position of factory owner. Haven't the wondrous stories of past tycoons inspired us? Wasn't Xi Guansheng a big boss from a young apprentice? Wasn't Edison a big capitalist from a young newspaper vendor? And weren't many wealthy people like Hartung and Da Lai "of humble origins"? So there are some people who can write well who say: "As long as you can be sincere and earnest, thrifty and hardworking, there will be a day when you can climb to the top!"—especially in amateur weekly magazines, you can often see such articles. Yes, these miracles are all true, but it is a pity that they have lost their "time." In the early days of capitalism, these miracles would happen and should happen, but now, capitalism is old and powerful. It has exerted its authority, and no one in its domain is allowed to climb in from the bottom. So "time" tells us that such expectation has become a boundless dream!</p>
<p>Second, let's step back and not expect "upward mobility," but expect "mediocrity." Let's not want to become a rich man, but just want to become a "comfortable middle-class family." But capitalism's inherent illness has reached the point of no cure. Roosevelt, MacDonald... and what Heleyo, Hitler... and the like, are desperately trying to find a panacea, but it is useless. What London Conference cannot cure this terminal illness. Overproduction, low purchasing power, and the decline of industry and commerce. As the days go by, the vast unemployed population created by capitalism is becoming more and more vast. This "recession" tide has already engulfed the entire world, and future unemployment will soon fall on our heads. Even if we want to be law-abiding citizens "living and working in peace" under capitalism, I am afraid that it is almost impossible. In this way, our second yearning has become a moon in the water!</p>
<p>So, we can't think, if we think, we will smile bitterly!</p>
<p>Finally, let me borrow the words of a friend—he is a shop assistant in a large store on Nanjing Road—to conclude this article. He said: "In the past, during our store's big sales, we would sell more than 10,000 yuan a day. Now, it's good if we can sell 1,000 yuan. And our store's expenses are more than 700 yuan a day. Can we continue to maintain this? At this time, the boss will of course have something to say: reduce expenses, lay off staff, then we will have to roll away. I am hopeless, but what about the rest of the majority?</p>
<p>Aren't the yarn factory layoffs also leaving the workers with no way out? Looking at the world situation, isn't the future world war about to break out? After the outbreak, China will of course become a slaughterhouse, and we in this group are afraid that we will become wronged souls under the guns. We have nothing to look forward to. We are only waiting for unemployment and death!"</p>
<p>But are we really waiting for "unemployment and death"? Can't we use our own strength to accelerate the removal of the root causes that cause our unemployment, poverty, and death? Maybe that's a "way out"!</p>
<p>Little Amateur Police Life Special Issue</p>
<h3>Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>— Ke Zixiang</p>
<p>Public Security Head Officer County Police</p>
<p>The life of a police officer is as monotonous and dull as a dry well, especially in a lonely small county town like ours. But recently, there have been rumors that bandits have appeared in Yangjiawa near the county town, and the county magistrate has issued an official order to the Public Security Bureau, requiring us to cooperate with the Public Security Brigade to eliminate them as soon as possible. So I, along with other dispatched colleagues and the Public Security Brigade, went to the bandits' lair with great effort.</p>
<p>Our leader was the captain of the Public Security Brigade. He was a true northerner, a large man who only knew how to boast. He always started his sentences with: "Damn your mother, no guts."</p>
<p>This time we saw that he had guts. He walked ahead with great fanfare. After less than five li, we sat down to rest because we needed to conserve our energy to fight. The brigade captain, full of energy, lectured us, sincerely teaching us many impractical tactics for suppressing bandits. For example, "When a machine gun comes, lie down and roll forward. Don't be afraid of hand grenades..." We were all tired of hearing these words. Finally, he suddenly said to us excitedly: "Brothers, this time you must do your best for the local people and give these dog bandits a good beating." Sure enough, we were all excited, and our legs were eager to get up immediately. After about a quarter of an hour, we set off again.</p>
<p>We all knew that the bandits were in Yangjiawa, but we didn't know where in Yangjiawa. After all, the brigade captain was resourceful. He stopped in front of a teahouse and shouted inside aimlessly: "We are here to fight bandits in Yangjiawa. Does anyone know where the bandit den is?" Immediately, a man in his thirties stood up and said he knew. We asked him to lead the way, and he agreed, walking proudly side by side with the captain.</p>
<p>The team advanced along a series of earthen hills. The early autumn sun was as hot as the dog days of summer. We walked, complaining and covered in sweat. Everyone forgot the purpose of moving forward, walking as if lost in a dream.</p>
<p>When we were in a semi-dormant state, suddenly a loud noise erupted from the woods on the left, like a giant hammer striking a wooden barrel. It was undoubtedly a gunshot. Like wild rabbits, we scurried in all directions. As for the brigade captain, he was already lying on the ground like a dead cow, scolding us with his face sideways: "Damn your mother, lie down!" We inexplicably gathered together and lay down. Strangely, the villager who led the way stood there without any surprise, still with a foolish smile. Although the brigade captain lying next to him tried his best to punch his leg, telling him to lie down, he stubbornly stood there. A few minutes passed, and the surroundings were still silent. The villager became impatient and urged us to hurry. The bolder ones stood up first and looked around, but no bullets were flying, so they disappointedly called everyone. So everyone stood up and asked each other about the source of the gunshot. The villager suddenly said plainly: "This was a shooter (meaning a hunter) firing."</p>
<p>We walked silently for a few more li, and the guide said that the old nest was almost here. We could see it by turning around this woods. Turning around the woods, there were indeed five or six thatched huts at the foot of the earthen hill. Who would have thought that these very ordinary small houses would be ambushed by a group of strong men? So the team stopped unanimously. The brigade captain told the villager to go and see how many bandits were inside and what they were doing. But the villager refused to go. He said: "Sir, they have weapons." The captain turned around and asked us: "Which of you brothers will go and take a look?" But no one answered. "Damn your mother, no guts," the captain said again. "Fire! Shoot over there!" Everyone lay on the ground and fired at the few silent thatched houses. After less than thirty or forty shots, seven or eight men and women ran out, fleeing along the foot of the hill in panic. No bullets flew towards us. One of the fugitives fell, and another tried to help him in a panic. We surrounded them and captured both of them.</p>
<p>We were victorious. As expected. We went to a nearby village for a meal. After the meal, I chatted with an old woman. I said: "We have captured the bandits for you. No one will bother you anymore." But she said unhappily: "Bandits, bandits only eat our chickens. The lords in your city will even eat our chicken droppings. They don't have the ability to catch bandits, but they tie up good people." But I still didn't believe her. We worked so hard, were so frightened, and fired so many shots. Could we be wrong? And we came to fight bandits, isn't this person the one we wounded?</p>
<h3>A Chilled Heart</h3>
<p>— Wang Zexiang</p>
<p>From Soldier to Police</p>
<p>Our police station's lunch time is at 10:00 AM. The station provides the rice, but we have to buy our own dishes. We always eat: tofu, pickled vegetables, dried tofu, canned fish, over and over again. Even if it were better, where would we get the money?</p>
<p>One day after lunch, I chatted with a brother, a Shandong man. I learned that he was a soldier before, and participated in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. He was hit by a Japanese dwarf in the head while fighting in Jinan. Later, for some reason, the officers told them: "Now the revolution is successful, you can leave!" They gave each person a few silver dollars and disbanded. He wandered here and became a policeman. At first, he hoped to be promoted slowly, but after a few years, he remained the same. He often dreamed of going back to his hometown, but with a monthly salary of eleven dollars, four dollars were deducted for food, and he had to buy his own dishes, bathe, get a haircut, wash his clothes... and he hadn't been paid for two months. Fate nailed him firmly to "misfortune" like an iron nail, and the future of his life was hopeless!</p>
<p>He talked to me about the scenery of his hometown, about his family who were still eking out a living under the grace of the landlord. He fell silent. I knew that in a corner of the distant sky, in a corner of his soul, there was a gray-haired mother, a emaciated child, and: how lovely the bright mountains and forests were! The longing for his homeland broke his heart, and sorrow occupied his heart.</p>
<p>As for myself, I shared the same fate as him. Every time I thought about the monthly salary of eleven yuan, deducting four yuan for food, dish money, haircuts, bathing, washing clothes... my heart also chilled.</p>

<h3>Not a Drop Has Passed My Lips</h3>
<p>— A Vagrant</p>
<p>There is a saying: "The plan for a day lies in the morning. The plan for a year lies in the spring." Then, "Monday," in the eyes of our countrymen, can of course be regarded as a productive day of the week.</p>
<p>Spring has passed uneventfully, and the morning, too, has slipped away unremarkably in the friction between the soles of our shoes and the pavement. Only "Monday" is out of the ordinary, and contains more painful elements than other days.</p>
<p>Whether spring and morning are unremarkable in the eyes of others, I cannot say! But things like the mundane, the painful, etc., are just my personal feelings!</p>
<p>I am a 21-year-old young office worker who once made a living in a certain industry and has a high school education. Unfortunately, because of its closure, I have been unemployed for nearly a year. But there are still certain reasons that require me to pretend to be a productive member of society. So every day, after getting out of bed, I have to wander the streets to pass the precious – but no longer so precious – morning hours, noon hours... In the evening, this wandering soul can finally say that he has made it through the day. At night, lying in bed and thinking, I feel a bit like a compatriot in distress "unable to return home," tired and in pain. Society! I feel again the depression of having strength but being unable to sell it!</p>
<p>Not long ago, I discovered several public libraries in the city, of which the one in Ximen is more to my liking. In the afternoons, I occasionally take a detour to the Circulation Library to borrow a book to read. There is also the XX Association, which I heard has a rich collection of books, but I was frightened by someone who was ten times colder and more bureaucratic than a clerk and did not dare to visit a second time. Fortunately, the first two are enough to satisfy my desire to read and kill my painful time, and my wandering life can be considered to have come to a small end, and the pain has been relatively reduced. But the problem of selling labor still exists as before, has not been resolved: life is of course still unbearably bitter!</p>
<p>The most painful day for me is every "Monday." On this day, all the places seem to have formed a general alliance to carry out a strike against us "non-capitalists." Early in the morning, I start wandering on Jing'an Temple Road again and have no choice but to walk aimlessly. As for the destination, alas, there is none! In my heart, I just feel the wickedness of people, why not put some benches on the road so that I can rest my tired feet!</p>
<p>The street scene that I used to see still combs through my eyes. Thank goodness! I finally made it to the Huangpu Wharf. Past experience tells me that there is a river, water, and benches for people to rest, and it is also a place where it is relatively easy to pass the time and where I can temporarily forget my pain.</p>
<p>Today has turned to summer weather, and the merciless sun presses on the heads, bodies, and minds of the vagrants... There is not a single thread of peaceful wind in the universe. At this time, the few benches on the dock have already been occupied by quick-footed comrades. At the same time, my feet declare that they want to rest, and my nervous system sends a telegram reporting that my stomach is empty. Ah! The Customs House clock has struck eleven o'clock, and I haven't had a drop of water today! Usually, there is still a desire to read that can overcome hunger, but in this special situation of Monday, hunger is about to stage a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Alas! The days ahead are long, and the future is really bleak. Finally, I think about it and decide to go to file a report, requesting the gentlemen of society to help me in one or two ways. No matter how big or small the affairs are, as long as there is a position, that will do!</p>

<p>Edward G. Robinson caused a sensation throughout the silver screen after "Little Caesar" was released. From then on, he seemed destined to specialize in playing these "strenuous" roles – the most important of which were gangsters, thugs, etc. He played these roles very deeply and movingly because he was not only a superb thug actor, but also a great and talented actor. People thought that because he played these bad roles, his personality must be similar, but in fact, his character was exactly the opposite of what he played on the screen. He was a gentle and refined gentleman. The fierce light emitted from his dark eyes on the screen could scare the audience so much that their hair stood on end, but usually he was not like that at all. On the set, he was known for being good at worrying. His worries were not unreasonable. He was that way for the sake of the perfection of his work. You see him worrying about the story of his next film, the cast, costumes, set design, etc. He worries about everything.</p>
<p>Before dedicating himself to the silver screen, he was already a famous "red" actor in the United States, and now, of course, it goes without saying. He used to study dramatic art at Columbia University's School of Drama and later received a Master of Arts degree from the school. He also occupies an important position in the New York Theater Guild, the authority on American drama, and he is also proficient in various foreign languages ​​and has performed in several foreign-language theaters. During his sixteen years on the stage, he has performed in many famous stage plays. Although "Little Caesar" was the film that made film audiences deeply aware of his art, he also has many sound film works such as "Five Star Final" and "Two Seconds." He has also acted in many silent films. "Smart Little Girl" was in collaboration with Richard Barthelmess, and "The Sea Lion" was in collaboration with Lionel Barrymore. In this film, he played a farmer, and his performance was powerful and moving, which was really amazing. In fact, he is just as serious and hardworking about every film, which can be proven when we watch his films.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Spring Water and Love Waves"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Consciousness is Quite Good, the Performance is Excellent</p>
<p>A Rare Production by Mingxing Film Company</p>
<p>Foreword "Chinese films have indeed improved." After watching "Spring Water and Love Waves," I couldn't help but affirm this sentence.</p>
<p>In any case, under the circumstance that European and American films occupy an absolute advantage in the Chinese film market, it is indeed very surprising that Chinese filmmakers can be so energetic to improve their own works, especially the great change in the consciousness of film artists, which makes us somewhat optimistic about the future of Chinese film culture, although this still requires our audience to support it strongly and forcefully.</p>
<p>The above is of course not digressive nonsense.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhengqiu's Three-Anti-ism If we dare not ignore any director's "Idee woroking," then the great change that the elderly Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu has made is indeed worthy of our admiration. He clearly revealed the black幕 of officialdom selling official ranks in China in the picture. He ridiculed these ugly phenomena humorously and painfully in the subtitles. He criticized the frivolous love of those young masters who returned from the United States, explaining the hypocrisy of "love" in the real society (although he still gave him a chance to repent in the end). He explained the conflict in love between people of different wealth. He opposed the tyranny of feudal forces in the countryside and the unreasonableness of patriarchal society. He hated the atrocities of imperialism in semi-colonial China. But in the end, he did not resist strongly, but retreated passively to the northwest to develop "new territories" and was still confused by the fact that "charity" can save the poor masses. Of course, ""new territories" will never be created under the dual oppression, and "charity" has long been not enough to anesthetize people. However, in any case, the "three-anti-ism" that he himself strongly advocated is generally expressed here. At least he has recognized the poison of imperialism, feudal forces, etc. in China. Of course, we don't need to be demanding, so we can be quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Progressive Performance Skills Secondly, we should also pay attention to his directing skills. He narrated the story without any confusion, although he focused on love, he refused to relax the points that must be exposed. Because it is a depiction of love, he made the tone of the play soft. He also paid attention to the lens. Especially the rotating "long shot" of the lake tour is more lively, but because it is an exterior scene and the light is insufficient, it is not beautiful enough. However, several "close-ups" are very wonderful. But even better is the emotional aspect. He made every audience sympathize with Ah Mao and be sad for her, which is very successful in tragedy. But he did not write the Mao Shaojie well enough "bad" so that we don't hate him very much, especially when he repents. This point lacks "contrast" power, but we can't ignore that he is a person who follows the tide. Another point is that the distribution of actor roles is not appropriate. Yan Yuexian is not as suitable for playing Han Qiong. In short, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu did his duty in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Review of the Performance As for the performance, then Hu Die was quite successful. She was so serious and natural throughout, not at all forced. Her pain and tears were undoubtedly very deep and moving. However, at the end, when Mao Shaojie gave money, she was also so sincere. This is the director's neglect, and it can also be seen that she is not strong enough and has no power to express herself. Wang Xianzai was another success. Tan Zhiyuan has improved slightly compared to before. Hu Ping does not fit the personality. Yan Yuexian is still serious, Zhuan Yiqiu is okay, Li Junqing and Xu Xinyuan are average. Gu Lanjun is not as natural as in "The Future." As for the protagonist Sun Min, he was not successful. A gilded international student is not only gentle and refined. Moreover, there is no change before and after becoming an official. However, the identity of the young master is fairly well expressed.</p>
<p>Epilogue Regarding other points, I think the subtitles are very vivid, but the screening time is too short, and some are simply not completely readable. The photography and scenery are not bad.</p>
<p>In short, I think this is a very mature work of the Mingxing Film Company, and it is naturally rare in Chinese silent films. Roughly, people who care about Chinese films, although not completely satisfied, will not be so disappointed. Finally, I respectfully wish the authors of this film all the best!</p>
<p>New Movie Preview</p>
<h3>"Impressions of the Homeless"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhong</p>
<p>People who escaped from the flood line created by the feudal class and the bloody iron hooves of imperialism to another hunger line are all homeless wanderers. On the other hand, the young wives of capitalists in the city, who are sheltered by imperialism, are abandoned by the playboys who are tired of the old and like the new, and are also wandering aimlessly in the streets. Facts educate them that to survive, they must concentrate their strength and fight.</p>
<p>This kind of realistic subject matter has been seen a lot on the screen, but they are all separate or distorted. Only Yihua Company's debut work "Homeless" closely organizes these three types of typical people—the flood line, the iron hoof line, and the almost abandoned people—and correctly sets out on the dangerous road to struggle. This is a symphony with eight-tone linkages. This is a lifelike sketch of China.</p>
<p>The other day was the screening date for this film. In an office temporarily used as a theater, the screen was displayed on light green plywood. The screenwriter and director Chen Yu explained the plot scene by scene at a rapid pace (because there were no subtitles yet). It wasn't until the bell rang ten times that we left the theater.</p>
<p>My impression of this film is that it breaks the old habit of having a protagonist and supporting actors (in terms of the development of the plot), so that the entire plot is powerfully distributed on each actor. New Montage is used here: In the continuous snow scene, every oppressed person excitedly opens up their way forward in the group will. There are no stars who have been praised here—they are all actors who are on the screen for the first time, but they are all bright lights in the depths of darkness. The light is bright and dark, and he adjusts it appropriately, and we cannot help but admire the superb skills of the Camera Man.</p>
<h3>Little Sister Will Star in "Little Sisters"</h3>
<p>— Mei Gong</p>
<p>Plus a Group of Smart and Beautiful Little Sisters</p>
<p>Today's movie stars seem to be characters from Liangshan Marsh, with nicknames often topping their names, such as: Frugal Star Chen Yumei, Wild Rose Wang Renmei, Sweetheart Lili Li, Little Actress Yuan Meiyun... etc. Especially famous is Little Sister Li Minghui. She often does not sign her name when writing letters, only writing the three words "Little Sister." It can be seen that she also loves this nickname very much, but she is now a big sister in age. It's just that her temperament is still innocent, lively, and she hasn't changed her true colors as a little sister.</p>
<p>She returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong last year and rejoined the film industry. She starred in the sound film "Pursuit" at Tianyi Company. After it was released, the audience developed a deeper affection for this little sister who had been away from the screen for a long time because she had not lost the lively and innocent style of a little sister from five or six years ago.</p>
<p>She saw that there were many smart and beautiful little sisters in Tianyi Company, such as Yuan Meiyun, Shao Suxia, Chen Qixia, Chen Jingfang, etc., all of whom were fifteen or sixteen years old and had performing talents. If they could gather this group of little stars to co-star in a play, they would definitely achieve complete success. She repeatedly asked Shao Zuiweng to co-star in a film with this group of little sisters. Shao Zuiweng greatly approved of this proposal and planned to write a script specifically for them. The film is called "Little Sisters." The plot is roughly a family drama with educational meaning, starring Little Sister, with Yuan Meiyun, Shao Suxia, Chen Qixia, Chen Jingfang, etc. joining in the co-starring. Once the script is written, filming can begin. It can be said that it is a very interesting thing for Little Sister to star in "Little Sisters."</p>
<h3>Tianyi's New Soccer Game Plan</h3>
<p>— Jie Bing</p>
<p>The Tianyi football team led by Shao Zuiweng has been practicing morning and evening since its establishment, and all the players have sworn to be loyal and brave. A week ago, Tianyi issued a challenge, sending a letter inviting the News Department team to try out a friendship match at the China Football Field for the first time. Because there were too many fans that day, there was almost no space on the field. It was impossible to stop the game temporarily and agreed to postpone the game. However, the athletes on both sides were ambitious and determined to compete. The News Department had planned repeatedly and prepared two plans to solicit Tianyi's consent. One, hold a temporary secret game to avoid outside attention; Second, the battlefield is located in Yiyuan, sell tickets, and all the proceeds from the sale will be used as donations for "National Salvation Through Aviation." However, it is heard that both parties are currently considering the details and have not formally decided. I don't know when this hilarious soccer game will be staged on the Chun Shenjiang River.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Soviet Russian Cinema (1) by Rudolph Messel</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bao Han</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Last year, between July and August, the British Fabian Research Bureau organized a Soviet Russian study tour, employing experts to investigate the actual conditions in Soviet Russia, recording the real situation of various national and social undertakings after the Soviet revolution with scientific and professional eyes. Beforehand, the experts had long preparations and discussions in their home country of England, so that after arriving in Soviet Russia, they could immediately engage in the investigation and research within the scope of various selected issues. The result was twelve chapters of highly valuable expert papers, compiled into a book entitled "Twelve Studies in Soviet Russia." Although some experts were prevented from joining the investigation due to other matters, so that aspects such as the equipment of modern medical and health care in Soviet Russia, and the overview of the transportation system, could not be included in the book. However, everything else related to politics, economy, industry, agriculture, real estate, women, children, construction, municipal administration, cultural undertakings, etc., is all-encompassing. In addition, an article of important and profound relevance to this journal is "The Film In Russia" by Rudolph Messel. We have specially invited Mr. Bao Han to translate it for the enjoyment of the readers who support this journal. Furthermore, this book has not been published for long, and there are very few original copies in Shanghai, so its content value is also worthy of cherishing.</p>
<p>(1) Soviet Russian Ideals for Cinema</p>
<p>We who live in Europe are mostly controlled by preconceived notions about drama and film. We view these two forms of performance, firstly, as a means of utilizing someone's or someone's artistic talent, and secondly, as a necessity for our daily entertainment. Now, to understand the real situation of drama or film in Soviet Russia, the first thing to do is to actively eliminate our preconceived notions. We must first have a humble mindset before we can approach the problem, and more importantly, things that we usually consider absolutely immutable are suddenly changed and not absolute, but changeable, in the hands of the Soviet people. At this time, we should try to avoid various disappointments, disillusionments, or even despair. If we can study this topic in this spirit, we can naturally get at least a clear observation, or even understand it; but if we rashly enter this field of right and wrong without this spirit, there is absolutely no possibility of observing any important things, and of course, even less hope of understanding.</p>
<p>In Europe and America, we certainly believe that the biggest reason for the existence of film and theaters is that we, who claim to be a part of the audience, have a need to be entertained. Whether our view is right or wrong, there is no need to debate this here. But here it must be pointed out that this is a view held by the capitalist world, but at the same time it must also be pointed out that this view has completely disappeared in the Soviet Union.
